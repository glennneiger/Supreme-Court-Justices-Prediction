justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
does
it
make
any
difference?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
isn't
the
great
distinction
between
possessing
a
right
of
entry
and
--
on
the
one
hand
and
the
right
to
do
it
by
strong-arm
methods.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
the
issue
here
then
as
i
understand
you,
is
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
presence
of
the
landlord
in
his
consent,
these
officers
or
direction
to
go
in
makes
this
search
good.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
understand
that
one
to
abate
such
a
nuisance
or
who
has
left
or
suffers
premises
to
be
used
for
an
illegal
purpose
is
justified
in
the
use
of
any
means
necessary
to
gain
entry
or
must
he
resort
to
legal
proceedings?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
by
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
might
just
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
have
been
a
good
search
then?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
might
be
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please
sir,
as
he
--
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir?
has
he
discharged
his
full
duty
when
he
has
made
the
report?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
under
your
law,
could
they,
the
officers,
derive
any
author
--
entry
authority
from
him,
the
landlord?
