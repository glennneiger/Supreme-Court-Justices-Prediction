--

your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
you
may,
mr.
elliott.
mr.
erdahl.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
search
would've
been
invalid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
what's
been
in
doubt
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
just
want
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
what
you
said,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
did
you
mean
that
the
search
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
be
invalid.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
that
bear
on
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
he
could
just
--
just
go
in
and
forcibly
take
his
--
whatever
rights
he's
got
away
or
does
it
mean
that
he
has
a
right
to
go
into
court
and
do
the
things
that
are
normally
done
without
breaching
--
breaching
the
peace
or
--
or
the
rights
of
any
individual?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
he
have
gone
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
he
have
gone
in
himself
without
the
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
now,
where
do
we
get
that
authority
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
break
into
--
to
break
into
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
break
into
a
house
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
rented?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
a
--
is
opening
a
bathroom
window
and
climbing
in
a
bathroom
window
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
of
the
people
placing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say,
yes,
you
mean
yes,
it
is
a
breaking?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
a
break
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
a
breaking
by
anyone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
transaction,
in
this
thing
we're
talking
about,
was
there
a
breaking
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
have
anymore
rights
than
he
had?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
it's
the
same
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
the
same
as
if
bridgaman
had
done
it
himself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
bridgaman
hadn't
--
hadn't
been
there
and
the
law
enforcement
officers
were
there
and
they
smelled
this
mash
as
they
did
and
went
in
on
their
own,
would
this
be
a
valid
search?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
--
what
right
does
the
landlord
has
--
what
specific
right
does
the
landlord
have
that
law
enforcement
officers
do
not
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
also,
don't
the
--
don't
the
law
enforcement
officers
have
the
right
to
summarily
abate
the
nuisance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
it
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course,
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
they
--
of
course
they
have
the
right
to
file
suits
and
abatement,
but
--
i
know
in
other
states
that
they
also
have
--
have
the
right
to
summarily
abate
the
public
nuisance.
do
they
have
no
--
do
officers
have
no
such
right
in
--
in
georgia?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
summarily
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
a
--
no
i
didn't
say
anything
about
padlocked.
i
say
that
they
--
if
they
know
there's
a
nuisance,
public
nuisance
being
committed,
do
they
not
have
the
right
to
abate
that
nuisance
summarily?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we're
not
--
we're
not
in
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
just
like
to
[laughs]
--
i'm
just
trying
to
see
whether
--
whether
the
owner
has
anymore
right
to
summarily
abate
a
public
nuisance
than
public
officers
of
the
state
of
georgia
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
also
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
found
the
same
thing
and
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
police
were
there
though.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
assume
it
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
what
--
what
specific
statute
or
what
specific
law
do
you
rely
on
to
give
him
the
authority
to
go
into
the
house,
where
--through
--
through
a
bathroom
window,
in
order
to
abate
a
nuisance
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
could
not
do
the
same
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
i'm
--
what
--
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
do
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
what
do
you
rely
on
to
say
that
they
are
greater?
that's
what
i
want
to
find.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
going
to
argue
--
i
don't
want
to
quarrel
with
you,
i
want
to
know
the
law
in
which
you
rely
and
i'm
going
to
read
it.
that
that's
--
that's
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
it
involve
a
search
and
seizure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
in
those
cases
involve
searches
and
seizures
by
the
--
by
the
landlord?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
sustained
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
any
cases
that
involve
buildings
where
the
entry
is
the
equivalent
of
--
of
opening
a
window,
a
bathroom
window
and
going
in
to
the
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
allegations
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
what
happened
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
had
--
he
had
the
authority
of
the
law
behind
it
to
go
in
and
do
that
specific
act,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
argued
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
was
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
he
knew
what
was
in
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
he
know
any
--
did
he
know
anymore
than
the
officers
themselves
knew?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
had
said,
"no,
we
won't
get
out."
what
could
he
do
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
talking
about
he
has
the
right
to
go
there
and
evict
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
the
georgia
law,
as
far
as
i
can
gather
from
you
doesn't
--
doesn't
provide
that
that
he
has
a
right
to
go
there
and
either
summarily
evict
them
or
to
summarily
abate
the
--
the
nuisance
or
to
do
anything
else.
he
has
certain
rights
of
--
of
forfeiture.
he
has
certain
rights
of
entry
which
he
can
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he
can't
get
peaceably,
he
can
get
through
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
through
a
writ.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
has
maybe
other
rights
too,
he
has
a
right
to
inform
the
police,
but
does
he
have
the
right
to
go
and
climb
through
a
closed
window
of
the
bathroom
in
order
to
look
into
that
house
and
search
it
to
see
if
there
is
any
violation
of
law.
now,
where
is
your
georgia
law
for
that?
that's
the
basis
(voice
overlap
)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
found
it
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
any
of
these
statements?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
case
a
public
place
--
a
public
place
of
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
walked
in
through
an
open
door
that
the
public
had
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
had
the
right
to
go
into
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
want
us
to
decide
it
on
that
basis?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
case
turned
on
the
consent
of
the
--
of
abel
to
--
to
let
the
owner
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
in
abel,
the
--
the
court
said
that
--
that
he
had
consented
to
them
coming
there
and
taking
those
let
material
out
of
the
waste
basket.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
immigration
officers,
that
wasn't
through
the
--
through
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
came
there
with
administrative
warrant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
other
things
--
the
other
things
that
involved
the
--
the
landlord
as
i
recall
it,
there
were
done
according
to
the
court
with
his
consent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
abel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
hotel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
hotel,
it
was
a
hotel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
landlord
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
entry.
that
was
done
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
was
done
by
the
administrative
crew
and
the
administrative
warrant
gotten
by
the
--
gotten
by
the
immigration
authorities
on
the
information
of
the
fbi.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
know
how
to
turn
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
outrageous.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elliott.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
that
section
provide,
mr.
elliott?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what's
the
--
to
what
effect
do
you
quote
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
white
lightning.
[laughs]
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
as
to
the
next
case,
i
think
it
would
serve
no
purpose
to
--
to
start
at
this
late
--
late
moment.
we
will
start
fresh
on
it
monday
morning.
we'll
recess
now.
