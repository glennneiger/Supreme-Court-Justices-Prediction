well,
mr.

in
this
very
case
that
the

after
he
smells
the
strong
odor,
gone
away
and
done
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

later,
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
well,
the
operation
still
had
been
discovered,
would
his
property
have
been
forced
to
federal
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
shall
let
or
suffer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
let
or
suffer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
think,
in
this
instance
that
this
owner,
had
he
turned
around
after
smelling
the
odor
and
done
nothing
further,
might
perhaps
have
been
guilty
of
misdemeanor
under
that
section?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nothing.
he
walked
away
after
he
smelled
the
odor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
ask
about
let
or
suffer,
that

mr.
erdahl,
at
page

of
your
brief
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
go
--
go
finish.
i
thought
i
(inaudible)
had
you
finished
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
you
say
that
the
landlord's
right
to
enter
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
also
supported
by
provisions
of
georgia
law
which
make
the
operation
of
an
illicit
still
a
nuisance
and
give
the
owner
a
right
to
immediate
possession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
any
reference
to
any
georgia
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
where
is
the
--
any
statute?
i
don't
see
any
reference
in
--
in
your
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
only
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

105?
misdemeanor
section.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
--
do
you
have
that
in
your
brief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
where
this
window
partly
opened
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
assumed
it
was
fully
closed,
but
unlocked,
is
that
it?
