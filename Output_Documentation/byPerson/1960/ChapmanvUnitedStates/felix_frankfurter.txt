said

would
you
mind
stating
again
what
you
said
it's
been
clearly
held
that
you
must
scramble
search
and
seizure
and
you
can't
separate
it?
is
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
shouldn't
think
that
that
case
stands
with
the
proposition
that
search
and
seizure
unsurgical
--
unsurgicable
(inaudible)
that
tells
what
the
problem
of
whether
--
of
whether
the
federal
officials
participated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that,
i
know
what
that
means,
because
of
search
maybe
valid
and
it
doesn't
invalidate
the
seizure.
how
can
you
say
that
if
they're
--
they're
united?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
quite
appreciate
that,
i
hope
you'd
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
be
better
off.
i
know
the
wrong
prentice,
but
they
are
wrong
conclusions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
maintaining
as
a
matter
of
law,
investigable
law
that
which
minute
that
this
is
made,
in
view
of
whatever
relation
we
have
to
the
property
whether
in
behalf
owner
or
whole
owner
at
this
time,
it
isn't
clear
matter
of
law,
he
was
disempowered
and
he
was
not
--
he
did
not
have
authority
for
enforcing
officers
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
law,
standing
the
relations
of
property
that
bridgaman
did,
you
would
say
that
this
entitled
to
get
that
advice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
premises
in
the
outset.
i'm
talking
--
the
owner
--
the
owner
of
a
--
of
a
let
house
who
has
excellent
or
good
reason
of
believing
its
use
is
that
of
a
still,
has
he
no
right
of
entry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
don't
own
the
house.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you're
stating
that
to
beg
the
question,
if
i
follow
you,
don't
you?
the
question
in
very
specifically,
whether
the
owner
of
premises
having
good
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
being
used
for
a
still
has
no
right
of
entry,
nor
if
he
makes
a
bad
guess,
he
maybe
in
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
in
the
immunity
clause,
he's
fixed
so
out
of
--
before
you
sucked
his
little
finger
and
gave
you
that
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
all
depends
on
the
answer
to
justice
black's
question,
what
right
of
summary
termination
of
a
nuisance
is
there.
by
summary,
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
get
any
legal
process.
like
justice
black,
that's
even
more
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
inquirer
for
what
the
law
is
and
i
--
i
--
one
does
know
that
there's
--
there's
a
good
deal
of
right
for
summary
termination
of
a
nuisance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
overrule
trupiano
in
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
we
overruled
it
explicitly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
question
wasn't
in
trupiano,
the
one
i'm
now
putting
to
you
and
the
one
justice
black
puts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
some
light
on
what
the
limit
--
what
--
what
the
right
of
summary
termination
of
nuisance
is
and
what
the
limits
of
that
right
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
be
a
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
a
difference
whether
anybody
is
in
or
not,
if
in
fact,
fumes
were
emitted
which
at
the
outside
smelled
as
--
as
a
still.
what
is
the
difference
between
that
and
the
--
the
narcotics
case,
opium?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
have
to
have
an
arrest
if
--
if
something
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
but
you
may
go
in
--
you
don't
have
to
have
an
arrest
in
order
to
deal
with
an
--
with
a
patron
service
violation
of
law,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
basis
for
that
interpretation?
did
the
--
did
the
entry
--
did
what
they
found
upon
entry
negative,
the
interpretation
of
the
external
phenomenon?
did
they
--
did
they
--
did
they
find
it
wasn't
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
takes
us
back
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
takes
us
back
to
the
question
that
justice
black
and
i
was
digging
some
light
at.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
to
think
of
the
landlord's
right
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
entry
was
lawful
at
--
in
order
for
you
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
anybody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
was
overruled
over
my
protest.
the
fact
doesn't
make
it
any
delay
from
overruled
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
then
they
remained
after
the
overruling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
before
you
sit
down.
suppose
that
--
suppose
people
had
been
found,
everything's
the
same,
except
when
they
entered,
people
are
actually
found
on
the
premises
with
all
these
still
materials,
does
that
make
a
difference
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
that
the
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
landlord's
smelling
this
fragrance.
and
if
you
say
that
he
would
--
it
would
make
a
difference
after
he
called
the
officers,
because
i
give
you
permission
to
enter,
if
they
found
people
there,
you
say
that
would
make
a
difference,
then
i
ask
you,
how
can
it
in
law,
make
a
difference
whether
the
landlord
can
smell
that
anybody
is
preset
or
merely
smells
the
fumes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
so,
then
we've
got
two
courts
and
say
that
under
the
circumstances,
that
was
a
reasonable
entry.
that
the
landlord
can
make
a
fine
calculation
and
say,
"i
must
make
that
sure,
somebody
is
in
there.
if
somebody
is
in
there,
i
can
give
lead
to
--
for
entry.
if
nobody
is
in
there
--
is
in
there,
i
can't."
i
can't
imagine
the
law
turns
down
in
such
a
demand
of
prophecy
on
the
part
of
the
landlord.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
there
is
justification
as
to
the
olfactory
nerves
that
he
--
that
he
smelled
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
it's
the
same
principle,
the
seizure
of
automobiles
that
are
instruments
--
somebody
else's
--
as
i
remember,
this
court
has
held
that
an
innocent
man,
either
for,
used
for
violations
of
the
volstead
act,
the
volstead
prohibition
law
that
ever
--
that
were
--
although
the
owner
of
the
automobile
is
innocent
of
the
purposes
to
which
it
views,
forfeits
the
automobile,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
it
can
be
a
status
under
the
statute
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
away
all
the
stuff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
erdahl,
if
he
has
the
right
and
it
seems
to
me
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
have
put
to
you
several
times,
in
--
in
the
crucial
question
in
this
case,
namely
(a)
has
the
landlord
the
right
loosely
speaking
to
abate
the
nuisance
or
at
least
to
find
out
what's
going
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
he
has
that
right,
he
can
certainly
enforce
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
somebody
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
he
--
if
he
has
that
right,
then
we
can't
go
into
his
motives
and
find
whether
his
(inaudible)
legal
or
whether
he
wants
to
protect
his
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
might
be
a
great
believer
in
(inaudible)
and
yet
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
want
to
protect
his
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
tiffany
on
property
or
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
provision
of
the
georgia
code,
which
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you're
--
you're
relying
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
general
law
of
property
of
an
entry
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
a
landlord
to
the
premises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assume
he
must
have
given
some
citations,
are
any
footnotes
to
that
text
in
tiffany?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
for
our
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
other
states,
but
there's
no
georgia
case,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
seem
to
be
--
you
seem
to
be,
what
shall
i
say,
reluctant
or
inhibited?
we
--
from
i'm
speaking
for
myself.
it's
a
long
time
since
i
knew
any
property
law
and
i
want
enlightenment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
some
sister
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
couldn't
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
be
invitations
if
i
won
--
they
couldn't
be
cases
where
the
tenant
invites
the
landlord
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
--
there
must
be
cases
where
the
tenant,
did
he
consent
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
begin
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
erdahl,
you
don't
seem
to
argue
--
i
hadn't
--
i
just
flipped
your
--
the
pages
of
the
brief
and
i
therefore,
do
not
know
what's
in
it.
but
you
don't
seem
to
argue
on
the
basis
of
the
case
within
this
court
that
the
question
of
search
is
a
question
of
the
unreasonableness
under
--
of
the
search.
and
therefore,
i
should
think
as
one
is
not
sympathetic
with
those
cases,
but
taking
them
as
the
decisions
of
this
court,
i
don't
see
you're
arguing
on
--
argue
that
it
could
hardly
redeem
the
non-reasonable
search
if
a
policeman
thought
that
the
landlord
authorized
him
to
enter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know,
but
i
mean
to
be
more
specific.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
a
line
of
argument
with
which,
as
i've
said,
i'm
not
sympathetic
but
might
respect,
if
we're
going
to
take
the
starting
point
of
the
decisions
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
erdahl
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
forgive
me
for
saying
so,
i
do
not
think
you
have
yet,
even
what
you've
just
said,
argued
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decisions
regarding
search
and
seizure.
it
is
not
a
course
of
decision
that
every
entry
without
a
warrant
is
presumptively
an
unlawful
entry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
line
of
reasoning
that
this
court
has
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
dealt
with
unreasonable
search
as
the
affirmative
authorization.
unreasonable
search
isn't
the
exception
to
the
demand
for
a
warrant.
otherwise,
the
cases
wouldn't
be
--
be
what
they've
been
that
even
if
there
was
time
to
get
a
warrant,
it
doesn't
matter.
therefore,
the
question
isn't
--
the
question
is
whether
in
--
under
all
the
circumstances,
this
was
an
unreasonable
thing
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
the
landlord
thought
he
had
the
right
to
do,
i
do
not
see
and
it
is
not
a
--
isn't
on
egregious
assumption,
it
isn't
defensible
assumption.
it's
one
that
one
has
controversy
about
as
to
--
to
the
extent
of
a
landlord's
power.
i
don't
see
how
he
can
argue
it's
unreasonable,
because
he
might
be
wrong
as
to
georgia
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'll
give
them
back
to
you.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
would
it
make
a
difference
if
the
window
was
opened
because
even
open
windows
would
(inaudible)
go
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
he
cannot
go
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
part
of
invitation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
a
window
that
--
that
you
have
to
lift.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
entered
his
room.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
generous
of
me
to
make
that
suggestion,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
generous
to
you,
i
mean
generous
to
the
idea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
it
would
be
forfeitable
under
federal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
it's
--
and
you
would
regard
it
as
a
--
a
trespass
for
him
if
he's
under
this
duty
at
least
of
reporting,
to
verifying
his
sense
of
smell
by
visual
--
by
visual
proof?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
would
be
trespass?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
door
was
open.
justice
felix
frankfurter
practically
yes,
but
do
you
think
that
landlords
can't
take
measures,
as
one,
he
could
be
certain
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
they
were
mashing
things
up
if
--
what
if
he's
under
a
duty
to
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
found
that
nobody
is
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
requirements
of
this
court
as
to
this
--
that
is
not
the
test
of
ambiguity.
