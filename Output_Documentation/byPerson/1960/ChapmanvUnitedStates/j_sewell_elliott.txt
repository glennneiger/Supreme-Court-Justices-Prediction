mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
honorable
court.
as
you
have
noted
from
the
record,
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit
informal
pro
press.
i
would
like
to
comment
before
i
begin
my
argument
that
there
is
a
correction
to
the
brief
of
petitioner
on
page
12.
i
think
it's
an
obvious
error
with
nevertheless
i
do
want
to
point
it
out
to
the
court.
in
the
second
paragraph
there,
third
line,
"any
waste
being
committed
therein,
such
could
not
be
used."
in
other
words,
the
word,
"not"
should
be
inserted
between
could
be.
now,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
violation
of
internal
revenue
laws
relating
to
liquor.
he
made
a
timely
motion
to
suppress
certain
evidence,
but
this
motion
was
overruled.
and
in
view
of
this
ruling,
the
case
is
brought
to
this
court
at
this
time.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
correction
is
on
page
12
in
the
second
paragraph,
third
line.
first,
i
would
like
to
briefly
review
the
facts
which
i
believe
are
pertinent
to
the
court
at
this
time.
in
this
particular
case,
a
residential
type
house
in
a
residential
area
and
i
might
add
that
the
--
the
pictures
of
that
house
available
to
the
court
as
exhibits
and
it
is
obvious,
looking
at
those
pictures
that
this
was
a
very
definite
substantial
real
--
piece
of
real
estate
in
a
residential
type
house
in
a
residential
area.
now,
this
house
was
searched
by
state
officers
without
any
warrant
of
any
kind.
they
had
no
arrest
warrant,
they
had
no
search
warrant.
at
that
time
that
the
search
was
made,
the
house
was
leased
out
to
the
petitioner.
the
owner
thought
that
the
house
was
being
occupied
by
this
petitioner
as
a
resident.
the
officers
who
entered
knew
this
and
they
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
house
was
not
being
occupied.
the
entry
was
made
by
boosting
one
of
the
officers
up
on
the
shoulders
of
another
one
and
opening
a
closed
bathroom
window,
pushing
aside
a
shade
and
thereby
entering
the
house.
before
the
entry,
there
was
only
one
indication
of
any
violation
of
any
law
within
the
house
and
that
was
that
the
odor
of
fermenting
mash
was
smelled
emanating
from
the
house.
now,
i
might
say
that
as
i
have
mentioned,
petitioner
was
the
lessee,
but
he
had
not
given
permission
for
the
entry.
the
entry
was
not
made
incident
to
any
arrest.
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
anyone
within
the
house
and
there
was
in
fact,
no
one
in
the
house
at
that
time.
the
entry
was
made
solely
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
evidence
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
making
an
arrest.
there
were
no
compelling
circumstances
such
as
to
require
the
immediate
action
of
entering
the
house
before
obtaining
a
warrant.
at
the
time,
there
were
two
--
three
men
there,
two
officers.
both
--
both
of
the
officers
armed
with
pistol
and
the
owner
of
the
house.
there
were
other
houses
close
by,
one
in
particular,
next
door,
that
had
a
telephone
in
it.no
effort
whatsoever
was
made
to
obtain
a
warrant.
this
house
could
have
been
watched
and
should
have
been
watched
and
the
proper
warrant
obtained
before
this
entry
was
made.
the
only
other
significant
fact
that
i
think
the
government
will
cover
quite
thoroughly
when
they
get
to,
is
the
fact
that
they
feel
or
seem
to
feel
or
contend
that
the
owner
of
this
house
being
there
and
having
reported
the
odor
to
the
officers,
thereby
strip
this
petitioner
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
there
is
one
other
factor
which
is
now,
not
too
important
or
--
but
i
will
mention
it
and
that
is
that
these
state
officers
called
in
the
federal
officers
immediately
after
their
entry.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
thank
you,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
practically
completed
my
reference
to
the
statement
of
facts
before
lunch.
there
is
one
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
mention
and
that
is
that
the
united
states
has
concluded
that
this
was
an
oral
rental
agreement.
i
do
not
feel
that
this
is
supported
by
the
evidence
and
by
the
record
in
this
case.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
75
of
the
record
there
at
the
--
down
in
the
second
answer,
the
lengthy
answer
there,
"and
i
fixed
him
up,
agreed
to
rent
it
to
him
and
fixed
him
up
a
standard
30-day
rental
contract
for
the
rent
and
erred."
i
don't
believe
the
evidence
supports
that
it's
an
oral,
although
i
do
not
know
that
that
is
too
significant
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
now,
since
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case,
this
court
in
the
elkins
case,
overruled
the
so-called
"silver
platter
doctrine"
by
holding
that
evidence
obtained
by
state
officers
which
would
have
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
an
individual,
if
it
had
been
obtained
by
the
federal
officers,
is
not
admissible
in
the
federal
court.
so
i
think
this
would
dispose
of
the
--
any
question
that
might
come
by
the
fact
that
a
state
agent
first
entered
this
house
and
that
the
federal
agents
were
immediately
called
into
the
case,
the
silver
platter
doctrine
question
is
disposed
of.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
no,
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
their
opinion
that
they
were
not
relying
upon
it.
that
is
correct.
although
the
united
states
never
questioned
specifically
the
standing
of
petitioner
as
a
lessee
of
these
premises,
the
trial
court
did
hunt
as
such.
however,
we
feel
that
this
question
has
been
put
at
rest
by
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
jones
from
district
of
columbia.
there
are
two
recent
cases,
jones
cases
that
i
will
refer
to.
one
originated
in
georgia
and
one
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
will
refer
to
them
as
such.
i
make
reference
now
to
the
jones
case
from
the
district
of
columbia.
in
other
words,
in
the
jones
case
from
the
district
of
columbia,
if
anyone
is
legally
upon
the
premises,
then
he
has
a
standing
to
assert
his
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
view
of
these
two
recent
decisions
of
this
court,
this
leaves
only
one
question
open
to
the
court
at
this
time
and
that
is,
was
this
search
and
seizure
reasonable
under
these
circumstances?
now,
i
would
like
to
mention
some
general
principles
before
proceeding
further.
first,
a
search
and
seizure
cannot
be
separated
as
intimated
by
the
united
states
in
their
brief.
they
cannot
be
considered
as
two
separate
things.
they
must
be
considered
together,
the
search
and
the
seizure.
you
cannot
say
that
one
part
is
the
search
and
the
other
part
is
the
seizure.
that
has
been
very
clearly
set
forth
in
the
decisions
of
this
court.
this
court
has
also
held
that
a
search
warrant
is
necessary
in
all
instances.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
yes,
i
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
what
specifically
i
am
referring
to
is
this,
that
search
is
a
functional,
not
merely
a
physical
process
and
it's
not
completed
unto
--
until
effective
appropriation
as
part
of
an
uninterrupted
transaction
of
a
--
of
illicitly
obtained
objects
or
subsequent
proof
of
an
offense
to
--
to
differentiate
between
participation
from
the
beginning
and
joining
before
the
search
runs
its
course,
would
draw
two
final
line.
i
am
referring
to
the
language
of
the
lustig
case
and
i
feel
that
in
this
particular
case
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
this
was
a
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
is
correct
and
that
had
to
do
with
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
however,
the
language
there
and
also
in
the
--
the
jeffers
case.
there
again
said
that
the
search
and
the
seizure
are
not
easily
isolatable,
but
are
bound
together
by
one
sole
purpose.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
don't
really
feel
in
view
of
the
facts
of
this
case
that
this
is
significant
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
except
to
the
point.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
yes.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
as
a
general
principle,
it
might
be
said
that
a
search
warrant
is
necessary,
except
when
you
have
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
now,
that
maybe
with
or
without
an
arrest
warrant
or
--
or
either
in
exceptional
circumstances.
and
if
the
burden
is
upon
the
government
to
show
the
need
for
searching
premises
without
a
warrant
and
we
feel
that
they
have
not
shown
any
need,
any
compelling
circumstance
that
would
require
them
to
search
these
premises
before
obtaining
a
warrant.
i
think
another
general
principle
that
is
important
to
us
today
is
that
evidence
found
after
the
entry
cannot
be
used
to
justify
the
entry
nor
can
theories
that
have
been
conceived
in
the
attorney's
office
or
in
the
law
enforcement
offices,
some
months
or
years
after
the
entry
was
made,
be
of
any
assistance
in
any
way
to
justify
a
search
without
a
warrant.
it
would
depend
upon
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
available
at
that
time.
in
view
of
the
contention
of
the
government
which
i
anticipate,
i
think
that
that
perhaps
would
be
of
importance
to
the
court.
also,
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
those
justly
accused
as
well
as
to
the
innocent.
it
is
a
constitutional
guarantee.
now,
getting
back
to
this
search
which
was
a
search
without
a
warrant,
either
an
arrest
warrant
or
a
search
warrant,
it
was
a
search
made
not
incident
to
arrest.
it
was
a
search
made
on
the
circumstances
where
no
boat
or
automobile
was
involved
that
might
get
away.
there
was
no
compelling
circumstance
here.
there
was
no
activity,
either
of
a
person
or
a
thing
in
this
house
at
that
particular
time,
and
there
were
sufficient
people
available
so
as
to
guard
the
house.
and
i
say
that
in
view
of
the
agnello
case
and
the
jones
form
the
fifth
circuit
case
and
the
taylor
case
and
the
jones
case,
those
four
decisions
of
this
honorable
court
have
held
that
probable
cause,
however
well-founded
for
belief
that
certain
articles
subject
to
seizure
are
in
a
dwelling
house,
cannot
of
itself
justify
a
search
without
a
warrant,
even
in
circumstances
where
the
facts
unquestionably
show
this
probable
cause.
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
only
one
indication,
possible
indication
of
a
violation
of
the
law
and
that
was
the
smell
of
mash
emanating
from
the
house.
now,
the
framers
of
the
constitution
concluded
or
i
should
say,
included
the
fourth
amendment
in
our
constitution
because
they
had
learned
though
sad
experience
that
the
decision
to
search
a
house
should
not
be
left
to
the
discretion
of
the
police.
but
as
a
matter
of
principle,
if
the
question
must
be
subjected
to
the
requirement
of
a
previous
judicial
sanction
wherever
possible,
by
that
is
meant
that
there
must
be
some
compelling
circumstance
of
some
type
before
a
law
enforcement
officer
has
the
right
to
make
the
decision
to
search
premises
without
a
warrant.
now,
there
are
five
decisions
of
this
court
that
i
would
like
to
refer
to
now
which
deal
with
situations
where
there
is
no
warrant,
no
arrest
warrant,
no
search
warrant
and
the
search
is
made
not
incident
to
arrest.
the
first
is
the
jeffers
case.
now,
in
that
case,
there
was
a
search
of
a
hotel
room.
this
was
held
to
be
illegal,
although
there
were
many
indications
of
a
violation
therein.
in
other
words,
there
were
noises
and
peeping
through
the
keyhole
and
other
indications
emanating
from
the
premises.
and
there,
the
petitioner
was
an
invitee,
but
nevertheless,
he
had
the
proper
standing
to
assert
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
it
also
important
there
to
see
that
the
facts
of
that
case
show
that
before
entering
this
hotel
room
where
no
one
was
present
and
without
warrant,
they
had
permission
from
the
manager
of
the
hotel
who
was
the
agent
of
the
owner.
they
even
were
provided
a
key
through
the
room
by
this
manager,
but
in
that
case,
the
owner
did
not
strip
this
individual
of
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
in
the
jones
case
from
the
fifth
circuit,
there
was
a
search
of
a
house
without
a
warrant,
without
a
proper
warrant.
in
that
particular
case,
they
had
obtained
a
daytime
search
warrant,
but
did
not
go
into
the
house
until
after
dark.
this
court
held
that
that
was
--
was
an
improper
search
and
seizure
in
that
particular
case,
because
even
though
there
were
--
there
were
members
of
the
family
of
the
petitioner
in
that
case
in
the
house
at
the
time,
they
told
the
officers
before
they
entered
that
to
wait
until
the
man
of
the
house
gets
back,
but
they
refused
to
do
so.
in
other
words,
they
were
put
on
notice
that
the
man
that
they
were
after
was
not
in
the
house.
therefore,
their
entry
was
not
incident
to
an
arrest,
but
for
the
purpose
to
procure
evidence
for
a
future
arrest,
which
is
very
similar
to
this
case.
in
that
particular
case,
there
were
many
indications
of
a
violation
are
still
was
running
in
the
house.
there
were
blowers
which
are
normally
connected
with
a
whiskey's
tale.
there
were
tubes
coming
from
the
house,
hoses
with
mash
running
out,
spent
mash.
there
were
many,
many
indications
and
they
had
even
obtained
a
daytime
warrant.
but
under
that
circumstance
just
as
here,
the
officers
should
not
have
entered
without
a
proper
warrant.
in
the
lustig
case,
there,
we
have
a
search
of
a
hotel
room
without
a
warrant.
in
that
particular
case,
there
again,
the
agent
of
the
owner,
the
manager
of
the
hotel
called
and
reported
this
particular
case.
i
might
also
mention
that
in
that
case,
the
--
the
petitioner
was
registered
under
an
assumed
name,
under
a
fictitious
name,
which
might
be
important
in
view
of
the
probable
contention
of
the
government
in
this
case.
but
nevertheless,
it
was
held
that
the
petitioner
did
have
a
standing
and
that
the
search
was
improper
without
a
warrant.
in
the
taylor
case,
the
officers
went
to
a
garage
and
they
smelled
whiskey
coming
from
that
house
and
they
broke
open
a
door
to
that
garage
and
went
in
and
found
whiskey.
this
court
held
that
it's
not
important
whether
that
garage
was
part
of
a
dwelling
or
not,
but
since
there
was
no
one
in
there
at
the
time
and
there
was
no
reason
for
the
officers
to
believe
that
there
was
somebody
in
there,
this
court
held
and
quite
properly
so
that
the
search
without
a
warrant
was
improper.
so
there,
we
have
searches
of
hotel
rooms,
of
garages
and
we
--
in
later
instances
in
other
cases
and
i
will
refer
to
have
the
search
of
barns.
in
the
trupiano
case,
that
case
was
a
search
of
a
barn.
the
facts
are
quite
lengthy
and
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
me
to
go
into
those
in
detail
here.
but
in
that
particular
case,
the
arrest
was
made
--
the
entry
was
made
incident
to
the
arrest
of
one
person
in
there.
this
court
upheld
the
conviction
of
that
man,
but
said
that
the
evidence
obtained
while
in
there
could
not
be
used
as
to
other
men
who
were
later
arrested
and
prosecuted
based
upon
the
evidence
found
at
that
time.
we
feel
that
that's
quite
important
here
in
the
sense
that
even
though
it
was
incident
to
an
arrest,
it
was
not
applicable
to
those
people
who
are
not
there
and
who
they
sought
to
prosecute
on
that
evidence.
therefore,
any
cases
are
not
too
much
in
point
except
for
sideline
issues
such
as
one
that
i
have
just
mentioned
where
they
deal
with
a
lawful
arrest
or
entry
whether
it'd
be
with
a
warrant,
arrest
warrant
or
without
an
arrest
warrant.
in
the
joines
case,
i
think
that's
of
interest
here
in
order
to
round
out
our
development
of
the
case
--
that's
j-o-i-n-e-s.
there
--
in
that
particular
case,
the
officers
had
a
search
warrant.
they
went
to
the
house
thinking
and
for
the
purpose
of
arresting
someone.
as
it
turned
out,
the
man
that
they
thought
was
there
was
not
there.
they
nevertheless,
were
able
to
use
that
evidence
because
they,
in
good
faith,
searched
the
house,
incident
to
an
arrest.
now,
in
the
agnello
case,
a
house
was
searched
which
was
far
removed
from
the
place
of
arrest.
i
think
that's
important
here
in
rounding
out
that
if
it
is
not
incident
to
an
arrest,
then
you
cannot
go
two
or
three
blocks
over,
after
arresting
a
man
and
search
his
house.
in
the
rabinowitz
case,
there
we
have
the
search
of
a
one-room
office
building,
which
by
the
way
was
open
to
the
public
and
the
search
was
restricted
to
that
one
room
in
which
a
man
was
arrested
under
a
proper
warrant
of
arrest.
in
that
particular
case,
this
court
held
that
the
law
enforcement
officers
had
the
right
to
properly
investigate,
to
look
and
to
search
the
premises
there.
and
in
that
particular
case,
it
was
a
restricted
search
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
quite
proper
under
those
circumstances,
because
it
was
incident
to
an
arrest.
now,
the
united
states
government
contends
that
the
landlord
was
acting
to
protect
his
property
and
that
he
gave
permission
for
the
search.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
decisions
that
we
have
mentioned
and
we'll
go
into
more
detail
on
support
any
such
contention.
not
only
do
the
case
is
not
supported,
but
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
support
it.
in
this
particular
case,
the
owner
of
this
house
went
to
the
house,
smells
some
mash
emanating
from
the
house.
and
this
is
the
way
the
facts
are
framed
up
and
i
think
this
is
most
important.
instead
of
going
immediately
and
calling
a
law
enforcement
officer,
a
general
law
enforcement
officer
to
come
out
and
help
me
protect
my
property,
he
didn't
do
that.
he
went
and
attended
to
some
social
business,
made
some
social
calls
and
then
after
a
while
when
he
returned
to
his
house,
he
didn't'
call
the
sheriff's
department
or
the
general
law
enforcement
agents.
he
called
the
state
revenue
agents
and
he
said
this,
"if
you
will
come
out
here,
i
will
show
you
a
still
and
you'll
have
to
get
here
by
such
and
such
of
time,
because
i'm
going
to
busy
after
that."
and
then
the
officer
did
come
out
and
picked
up
another
officer
and
came
out
and
made
the
search.
now,
those
facts
are
important
to
show
this.
that
the
owner
of
that
premises
had
in
mind
the
enforcement
of
the
liquor
law
and
there's
no
indication
whatsoever,
but
much
to
the
contrary
that
he
did
not
have
in
mind
protecting
his
property
or
keep
--
to
keep
waste
from
being
committed.
now,
the
decisions
that
i
spoke
of
in
the
trupiano
case,
the
owner
of
that
property,
even
drove
the
officers
out.
he
was
present
with
them.
he
had
worked
with
the
officers
and
drove
them
in
his
automobile
out
to
the
place
before
the
search
was
made.
therefore,
that
case
would
not
support
the
contention
of
the
government.
now,
in
the
jeffers
case
as
i
have
mentioned,
the
officers
got
the
key
to
the
hotel
room
from
the
manager
and
got
his
permission
and
the
manager
therefore,
is
the
agent
and
the
proper
agent
of
the
owner.
in
the
lustig
case,
i'll
mention
again,
the
manager
of
the
hotel
called
and
made
the
report
and
beckoned
the
officers
to
come,
very
similar
as
to
these
instances.
we
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly
show
that
this
owner
was
not
trying
to
protect
any
civil
protection
or
afford
himself
several
protections,
but
was
interested
in
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
and
we
say
that
an
owner
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
who
does
not
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
have
the
right
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
think
it's
very
definitely
shown
that
it
is
of
no
substance,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
quite
clearly
that
the
--
that
an
owner
of
property
does
not
have
any
right
to
strip
away
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
an
individual.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
no,
i
really
don't
think
so.
i'm
--
i'm
approaching
it
from
two
or
three
angles
here,
but
at
the
same
time,
i
think
when
we
finally
--
when
we
get
down
to
the
meat
of
this
case,
i
don't
think
his
motive
is
really
important.
i
think
that
that
he
has
a
right
to
go
in
the
civil
court
and
bring
some
action
for
a
damage
or
made
perhaps
under
certain
circumstances,
might
have
the
lessee
forfeit
his
lead.
but
those
are
civil
remedies
that
are
provided
to
the
landlords.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
not
--
not
if
he
--
under
these
circumstances,
not
if
he
was
not
a
conspirator
of
any
sort.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
alright.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
actually
under
the
federal
law
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
a
--
a
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
property,
property
that
is
used
in
violation
of
the
liquor
laws.
under
federal
law
is
--
is
forfeitable,
but
at
the
same
time,
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with
the
remission
portions
of
the
law
wherein
an
instance
such
as
this,
an
innocent
party
such
as
the
landlord
who
--
who
participated
in
no
way,
what
i
am
sure
have
--
have
his
remission
honored.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
would
think
that
if
he
neglected
to
report
over
substantial
time,
it
might
be
construed
as
entering
into
the
--
the
bench
shelves
and
perhaps
be
considered
a
co-conspirator
in
some
ways.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
be
entitled
to
consider
that
circumstance,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
was
cited.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
might
also
refer
--
i
plan
to
get
to
that
in
just
a
minute,
but
i
--
i
will
refer
to
it
at
this
time.
the
--
under
the
federal
forfeiture
statutes,
any
property
whatsoever,
which
is
used
in
the
violation
of
the
law,
then
the
owner
loses
all
property
rights
in
that
particular
item.
for
instance
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
would
refer
to
real
estate
as
well
as
personal
property.
and
i
say
for
instance
and
if
--
if
i
have
contraband
whiskey
or
articles
in
my
car
and
in
drive
--
and
in
driving
down
the
road,
then
i
automatically
do
not
have
any
rights
in
that
automobile.
just
like
under
the
application
of
this
georgia
statute,
the
lessee
may
lose
his
property
rights
in
the
real
estate,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
loses
his
constitutional
right.
they
are
two
entirely
different
things
and
there
are
many
cases
that
this
court
has
considered.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
don't
think
that
they're
involved
here.
i
think
it's
only
the
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
constitutional
rights
are
involved.
to
hold
otherwise
in
this
case
and
to
reverse
this
case,
would
be
too
far
reaching.
it
would
mean
that
there
are
too
many
people
this
day
in
time
who
have
--
who
do
not
own
their
house,
who
are
renting
their
house.
there
are
too
many
people,
for
instance,
if
you
say
the
owner
has
the
right
to
strip
away
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
person,
i'm
sure
that
would
go
even
further
and
say,
what
if
a
person
has
a
mortgage
on
a
house
or
has
a
deed
to
--
to
secure
debt
on
the
house,
then
he
likewise
would
have
the
right
to
protect
his
interest.
so
there,
we
would
end
up
gearing
the
constitutional
rights
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
directed
to
their
economic
standing,
which
would
be
entirely
improper.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
to
break
and
enter?
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
--
i
have
--
i
do
not
feel
that
he
had
the
right
to
break
and
enter.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
brief
of
the
government
i
think,
conceives
that
point.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
--
i
have
no
idea
that
he
has
the
--
i
do
not
think
that
the
--
the
owner
has
any
authority
to
give
to
the
law
enforcement
officers
the
right
to
break
and
enter
premises
when
no
one
is
there.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
feel
that
to
hold
that
would
be
just
as
bad
as
placing
it
within
the
hands
of
law
enforcement
officers
to
make
the
decisions.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
understand,
but
there
is
such
a
large
group
of
people
who
have
the
same
interest
of
ownership
such
as
a
mortgagee
on
a
house
or
the
various
owners
for
instance,
the
united
states
government,
i
would
say,
is
the
biggest
owner
of
residential
real
estate
in
the
--
in
--
of
--
of
any
--
anyone
that
we
might
find
and
let's
take,
although
we
have
other
large
corporations,
let's
take
the
united
states
government.
if
this
case
is
not
reversed,
then
the
united
states
government
through
its
various
agencies
would
have
the
right
to
strip
anyone
who
lives
in
a
house
provided
by
a
public
authority
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
that
individual.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
when
this
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
do
not
feel
that
the
owner
would
have
the
right.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
--
i
think
so
and
in
this
particular
case,
it
seems
that
the
government
in
their
brief,
distinguishes
between
locked
doors
and
whatnot.
i
understand
breaking
and
entering
to
raise
a
closed
window
and
not
necessarily
to
break
a
lock.
but
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
we
do
have
exactly
that,
strong-arm
method.
and
i
further
think
that
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that
there
was
no
intent
--
the
--
this
landowner,
he
--
what
he
did
just
like
any
other
citizen,
reported
what
he
thought
was
a
violation
of
the
law
and
turned
it
over
to
the
officers
for
them
to
do
what
was
required
of
them.
and
in
this
particular
case,
it
was
required
of
the
officers
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
and
not
to
take
it
upon
themselves.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
they
asked
for
permission,
"can
we
have
permission
to
go
in
this
house?"
the
owner
says,
"well,
if
what's
in
there
what
i
think
it
is,
you
can
go
in."
in
other
words,
the
matter
was
in
the
hands
of
the
liquor
officers,
not
the
general
enforcement
--
law
enforcement
officers.
this
--
this
owner
even
though
he
was
the
owner,
simply
was
reporting
what
he
thought
was
a
violation
of
the
law
to
the
liquor
people
just
as
any
other
citizen
could
or
would
have
done
in
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
do
not
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
this
court
did
not
feel
that
the
--
that
right
was
--
could
be
given
by
the
owner
in
the
trupiano
case
and
the
jeffers
case
and
the
lustig
case.
in
the
trupiano
case,
the
owner,
his
name
was
kell,
k-e-l-l.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
insofar
as
--
as
--
well,
you're
--
you're
referring
now
to
the
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
no,
it
was
overruled
insofar
as
it
concerned
searches
incident
to
an
arrest,
is
the
language
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
perhaps,
the
better
example
is
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
perhaps
the
better
example
is
the
jeffers
case.
in
that
particular
case,
the
manager
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that's
the
jeffers
case,
j-e-f-f-e-r-s.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
in
that
case,
the
manager
made
a
report
and
gave
the
officers
permission
to
go
into
the
hotel
room.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
in
that
--
he
gave
him
a
key
by
the
way
too
and
permitted
them
to
go
in.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
they
had
found,
in
that
particular
case,
there
were
many
indications
of
--
of
a
violation
inside
and
i
believe
that
case
is
the
case
where
they
had
looked
through
the
keyhole.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
would
like
to
distinguish
and
i
think
these
two
cases,
the
jeffers
and
the
lustig
bear
me
out
on
this.
when
you
--
in
your
statement,
in
the
set
of
facts
that
you
just
posed
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
you
say
that
the
law
is
being
violated
in
that
room
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
which
would
indicate
that
someone
is
in
that
room
violating
the
law.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
in
the
--
in
the
jeffers
case
and
the
lustig
case,
it
was
held
that
that
was
an
improper
search,
even
though
in
those
two
cases,
we
have
situations
where
the
--
where
the
manager
had
given
his
permission,
had
given
keys,
had
invited
them
to
go
and
they
had
reason
in
one
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
in
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
--
i
believe
that
was
when
they
had
occupants
in
the
room,
but
in
the
lustig
case
and
the
jeffers
case,
you'll
find
that
one
is
a
counterfeiting
case
and
that
upon
looking
through
the
door,
they
saw
--
they
saw
in
there,
money
on
the
table
and
they
heard
clanking
of
glass
or
metal
as
though
something
was
in
operation
or
may,
it
had
even
looked
through
and
gave
certain
observations
to
the
officers.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
--
i
think
in
this
particular
case,
the
important
thing
is,
was
it
incident
to
an
arrest
or
was
there
any
compelling
circumstance
--
circumstance
existing?
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
because
before
you
go
into
a
residential
house
or
go
into
somebody's
private
premises,
you're
supposed
to
have
a
warrant
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
and
it's
not
supposed
to
be
left
up
to
the
police
to
decide
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
or
not.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
actually
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
activity
in
that
house,
there
was
no
still
running
--
there
was
no
still
running.
there
was
no
activity
whatsoever,
in
this
house.
the
house
was
there
and
they
interpreted
the
smell
coming
from
the
house
as
the
smell
of
mash.
that
is
the
sole
circumstance
that
existed.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
--
no,
they
did
not
find
that
it
was
not
so,
but
i
do
not
think
they
can
take
advantage
of
what
they
find
after
they
get
inside
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
and
that
was
clearly
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
would
be
a
compelling
circumstance.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
think
that
that
is
the
criteria
with
reference
to
warrant,
the
entry
without
a
warrant.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
i
think
the
owner
has
a
right
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
to
--
to
keep
his
property
from
burning
down
and
to
take
what
--
what's
necessary
action,
but
there,
there
is
a
compelling
circumstance
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
which
requires
him
to
act.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
in
this
particular
case,
there
are
no
facts
that
would
indicate
that
--
that
his
property
would
forfeitable
to
the
government.
i
--
i
think
that
perhaps
the
fallacy
of
considering
too
much
along
this
line
would
be
that
we
are
thinking
only
of
the
rights
of
the
landlord.
i
think
that
we've
got
to
go
across
the
table
and
think
of
the
property
right
of
the
individual
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
--
i
do
not
feel
that
the
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
do
not
feel
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
support
that
and
i
--
and
my
interpretation
of
the
trupiano
case
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
yes.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
i
--
that
was
overruled
with
reference
to
the
search
incident
to
unrest,
denying
the
suit.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
with
the
court's
permission,
i
know
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
yes,
i
--
i
think
perhaps
it
would.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
think
--
but
i
think
that
two
things
are
important
there.
i
think
the
--
it's
important
to
just
consider
what
the
officer
had
reason
to
believe
before
the
entry?
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
i
think
there,
the
language
of
this
court
showed
that
it's
important
to
consider
whether
--
whether
the
officers
or
the
landlord
or
whoever
it
might
be,
had
reason
to
believe
that
someone
was
in
the
premises
or
not.
i
think
that
is
a
circumstance
that
must
be
properly
weighed
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
by
the
court.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
there
again,
it
would
be
hindsight
rather
than
foresight
of
justifying
the
entry
about
what
is
found
within
the
house,
which
i
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
was
the
only
indication
of
the
violation
and
that
has
been
held
not
to
be
probable
cause
to
enter
a
house
without
a
proper
warrant.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
time
i
have.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
we
have
discussed
the
number
of
aspects
in
all
of
the
aspects
of
this
case.
i
do
however
think,
it
is
most
important
to
consider
that
we
must
construe
the
rights
of
a
tenant
in
this
case,
as
opposed
to
the
rights
of
a
homeowner.
and
i
do
not
think
that
because
a
man
rents
his
house
that
he
should
use
--
lose
any
of
his
constitutional
rights
such
as
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
contest
or
to
ask
that
certain
evidence
be
suppressed,
simply
because,
he
is
the
tenant
in
the
house,
rather
than
the
owner.
i
cannot
--
that
does
not
set
well
with
me.
i
--
i'm
wondering
if
this
case
is
not
reversed.
if
the
house
is
owned
by
the
united
states
government,
if
the
federal
agents
couldn't
just
go
in
on
the
same
basis
that
the
government
claims
that
bridgaman
can
--
could
go
in
under
this
case.
and
would
it
not
be
stripping
away
the
individual
rights
of
those
tenants
in
the
various
housing
projects
throughout
the
country.
i
--
i
think
that
it
is
--
would
be
too
far
reaching
and
would
really
be
a
question
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
allow,
the
rights
of
individuals
to
be
stripped
away
in
that
manner.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
alright.
i
have
--
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
two
statutes
and
i
think
that's
all
there
is
under
georgia
law
that
we've
already
referred.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
58
ga.
code
109.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
it
--
it
says
--
it
reads
as
follows,
"common
nuisance,
places
defined
as
the
following
are
hereby
declared
to
be
common
nuisances
and
maybe
abated
as
such
upon
complaint
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
solicitor
general
of
the
circuit
or
any
citizen
or
citizens
of
the
county."
and
then
it
goes
on
and
refers
to
a
room
used
for
the
manufacture
of
unlawful
--
unlawful
manufacture
of
whiskey.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
yes,
in
other
words,
a
person,
a
landlord
or
any
other
person
must
go
into
court
if--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
they
want
to
abate.
they
cannot
break
and
enter
either
under
the
georgia
law
as
it
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
stand.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
think
it's
very
possible
that
the
court
would
consider
or
in
any
action
to
takeaway
his
property,
to
condemn
and
takeaway
his
property,
i
think
they
could
consider
that
factor.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
is,
in
that
particular
case,
it
seems
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
that
the
owner
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
it
seems
that
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
can
say
that
it
was
subjected
under
the
federal
laws.
i
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
i
cannot
reply
under
the
state
--
state
law.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
no,
not
--
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
under
federal
law.
it
could
be
if
it's
used
for
illegal
purposes,
it
could
be
forfeitable
and
it
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
and
--
and
in
an
instance,
where
a
landlord
fails
to
report
something,
he
could
be
therefore,
considered
a
conspirator
to
the
extent
of
entering
into
the
operation
or
harboring
a
criminal
activity
and
therefore
subject
--
subjected
to
the
penalties
that
would
come
to
anyone
who
participated
in
any
such
action.
i
would
also
like
to
refer
to
the
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
yes.
i
believe
that
in
this
particular
case,
what
we
have
is
this.
now
--
let
--
let
me
make
one
or
two
background
comment.
the
government
says
they
could've
entered
to
collect
rent.
well,
now
i
--
i
don't
know
what
that's
got
to
do
with
this
case.
in
--
in
other
words,
a
man
--
a
landlord
goes
to
collect
his
rent
and
he
knocks
on
the
door
and
nobody's
there,
what
is
he
going
to
do?
go
into
bathroom
window
and
find
the
pocketbooks
and
collect
his
rent?
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
case.
i
think
it
has
no
applicability
here.
and
getting
back
to
your
question,
justice
whittaker,
i
will
say
this
that
i
think
that
this
man
actually
just
as
any
other
citizen
when
it
came
to
his
attention
that
--
that
he
thought
the
law
was
being
violated
there,
he
made
a
report
not
to
the
general
law
enforcement
officers,
but
to
the
liquor
agents.
and
when
he
made
that
report
and
told
them,
"if
you
come
out
here,
i'll
show
where
it
still
is,"
i
feel
that
he
had
fulfilled
his
obligations.
i
feel
that
from
that
point
on,
it
was
within
the
hands
of
the
officers
and
the
officers
should
have
known
what
to
do
and
it
--
the
law
clearly
says
what
those
officers
should
do
in
the
abatement
of
an
action.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
not
--
not
to
the
extent
of
breaking
and
entering.
there
are
no
provisions
that
i
know
of
on
the
--
in
the
codes
of
georgia,
in
the
law
of
georgia
to
allow
it.
turning
to
the
common
law,
there
is
no
provision
there
to
allow
any
such
entry
to
the
extent
of
breaking
--
of
breaking
a
window
or
a
door.
and
by
breaking
the
seal
on
this
house,
by
opening
a
closed
window
is
very
clearly
a
breaking
and
it
is
not
permitted
by
--
by
federal
--
by
common
law
and
there
is
no
provision
under
state
law
for
any
such
action
that
was
--
as
was
done
here.
this
was
simply
--
very
clearly,
a
report
to
the
officers
by
a
citizen
that
i
think
the
law
is
being
violated
and
turning
it
over
to
the
officers
to
take
the
proper
action.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
think
it
would've
been
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
think
it
would've
been
trespass
for
him
to
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
enter
it,
to
do
anymore
than
he
had
done
before
the
officers
came.
and
i
think
the
officers
had
no
more
right
to
do
more
than
he
could
have
done.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
there
was
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
there
was
no
compelling
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
there
was
no
compelling
circumstance
here.
there
was
no
reason
in
the
world
why
the
officers
could
not
obtain
a
warrant.
there
was
full
and
ample
opportunity.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
the
--
i
have
two
or
three
other
comments
that
i'll
try
to
be
very
brief
on.
even
though
property
rights
would
have
been
lost,
either
under
this
georgia
statute
that
is
quoted
in
the
brief
of
the
government,
i
think
that
that
would
not
strip
away
from
his
--
him
his
constitutional
rights.
i
also
asked
the
court
to
please,
if
they
consider
the
quoted
section
58
ga.
code
106
that
they
also
consider
the
section
58
ga.
code
101
which
is
referred
in
that
section,
but
is
not
quoted
in
the
brief
of
the
government.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
section
provide,
your
honor,
the
term
"prohibited
liquors
and
beverages"
and
that
is
in
quote,
used
in
any
law
to
promote
temperance
or
to
suppress
the
evils
of
intemperance
shall
include
the
following.
one,
alcohol,
alcoholic
liquors,
spirituous
liquors
and
all
mixed
liquors,
any
part
of
which
is
spirituous,
foreign
or
domestic
spirits
or
rectified
or
distill
spirits;
absent,
whiskey
brandy,
rum
and
gin
and
then
two,
venus
liquors
and
beverages,
three,
"nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
apply
to
fermented
beverages
made
from
malt
in
hold
or
in
thought
or
any
similar
beverages."
i
feel
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
well,
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
nothing
in
this
house,
but
mash.
there
--
there
was
no
liquor
in
this
house.
and
i
do
not
believe
this
particular
section
has
any
applicability
here
because
i
do
not
think
that
was
anything
in
that
house
that
would
exercise
any
forfeiture.
and
i
also
want
to
point
out
that
the
section
provides,
shall
at
the
option
of
the
landlord,
work
a
forfeiture.
there's
no
indication
that
the
landlord
exercised
any
or
--
or
option
to
forfeit
the
rights
of
this
tenant.
there's
no
indication
that
he's
--
took
it
upon
himself
to
say,
"there
is
a
forfeiture
and
therefore,
you
are
not
required
to
pay
anymore
rent
under
any
contract
that
may
exist."
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
that
question.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
the
record
shows
that
--
that
it
was
simply
mash.
i
--
i
can't
help
you
on
that,
sir.
i
think
it
was
a
type
of
mash
that
has
been
left
to
ferment,
as
i
understand
it.
there
was
no
whiskey
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
and
none
in
the
house.
so,
i
don't
think
there's
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
applicability
of
this
statute.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
your
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
as
i
understand,
i
--
i
think
perhaps
it
would've
been
white
lightning
if
the
process
[laughter]
had
been
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
--
had
been
terminated.
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
that
would
be
hard
liquor.
what
they
[laughter]
term
as
white
whiskey
or
--
mr.
j.
sewell
elliott
there
is
no
--
there's
nothing
in
the
georgia
law
to
permit
this
landowner
to
do
what
he
did.
i
further
say
that
i
do
not
agree
with
the
contention
of
the
government
that
--
in
other
words,
they
present
this
argument.
they
say
that
the
landlord
actually
went
in
and
took
the
--
the
agent
with
him.
i
don't
interpret
the
facts
and
i
don't
think
the
facts
support
that
conclusion.
i
think,
at
most,
what
it
was,
it
was
a
report
to
the
liquor
agent
that
i
think
i
know
where
you
can
find
the
still
and
he
helped
them
locate
it.
and
at
that
stage
of
the
game,
it
was
turned
over
to
the
officers
and
they
should've
known
exactly
what
to
do
and
that
a
warrant
was
required.
also,
it
was
a
case
of
going
around
the
house.
the
harbin,
who
is
the
officer
who
entered,
went
all
the
way
around
the
house,
tried
all
the
windows
until
he
found
one
that
was
unlocked
and
that
one
he
went
into.
i
also
would
like
to
point
out
that
this
house
or
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that
the
house
was
not
back
in
the
woods
to
such
a
--
to
such
an
extent
that
it
could
not
be
clearly
seen.i
t
was
a
little
longer
than
the
length
of
the
courtroom
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court
from
the
road.
it
could
be
clearly
seen
from
the
road.
it
was
not
hidden
back
in
the
woods
as
a
still
house
might
be.
and
i
want
to
thank
this
honorable
court
for
your
indulgence
in
the
presentation
of
this
case.
thank
you.
