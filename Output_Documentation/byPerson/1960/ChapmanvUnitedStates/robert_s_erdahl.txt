mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
about
the
orders
mentioned
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rely
on
the
silver
platter
doctrine.
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
it
did
not
--
not
only
did
not
rely
on
it,
it
disclaimed
any
reliance
on
it.
it's
pointed
out
that
the
elkins
case
was
at
the
time
pending
here
and
it
does
not
in
particular,
forecast
the
result.
i
should
also
like
to
point
out
that
there
was
no
and
heard
and
whatever
the
silver
platter
in
the
district
court's
oral
ruling
of
nine
motions
to
suppress.
the
court
--
the
district
court
pointed
to
the
fact
that
this
house
was
not
a
dwelling,
not
used
--
as
though
the
dwelling
house
was
not
used
as
a
dwelling,
rather
it
was
used
as
a
manufacturing
establishment
that
it
was
sunday,
that
there
was
probable
cause.
and
finally
and
most
importantly,
there
is
a
specific
finding
by
the
district
court
that
the
owner,
bridgaman,
the
landlord,
told
the
officers
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
that
there
was
a
still
in
his
house
and
not
only
consented,
but
asked
the
officers
to
go
in
and
see
about
it.
in
its
opinion
on
rehearing,
denying
petition
for
rehearing,
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
did
have
in
its
opinion
of
affirmance,
emphasized
--
i'll
read
it,
"in
view
of
the
emphasis
we
--
which
we've
placed
on
the
fact
that
the
entry
was
a
bridgaman's
request,
we
think
it's
appropriate
to
answer
petitioner's
contention
that
the
court
placed
too
much
emphasis
upon
bridgaman's
request
and
the
court
alluded
to
the
testimony
of
chance,
the
state
revenue
agent.
question,
"and
did
the
owner,
mr.
bridgaman
tell
you
to
go
in
there
and
see
about
it
and
see
what
was
in
his
house?"
answer,
"that's
right,"
and
the
court
said,
"the
trial
court
so
found"
that
is
found
the
consent
and
request
and
that
the
evidence
amply
supported
the
finding.
before
i
leave
that,
i
would
like
to
also
point
to
the
testimony
of
--
the
further
testimony
of
officer
chance
which
the
court
will
find
on
page
13
of
the
record.
this
one
sentence
in
his
testimony
sums
it
all
up
very
neatly.
he
was
asked
about
why
he
didn't
get
a
warrant.
he
said,
it
was
sunday,
"well,
can't
you
get
a
search
warrant
on
sunday?"
he
said,
"i've
never
gotten
one
on
sunday."
"you
didn't
make
any
attempt
to
get
any
search
warrant,
did
you?"
then
chance
answered
this
--
this
way,
"well,
i
didn't
feel
no
call
to
get
one.
the
man
that
owned
the
house,
he
was
there
and
he
told
us
to
go
in,
in
the
window"
and
see
what's
--
what
in
there,
and
that
should
be
--
what's
--
printing
error,
what's
what
or
what
was
in
there,
so
he
went
on
in.
now,
that
puts
the
issue
here
in
focus.
my
opponent
says
that
this
has
--
but
another
case
of
and
a
--
a
police
entry
into
protected
premises
upon
probable
cause
without
more
and
he
--
he
called
the
rule
of
the
cases.
he
would
have
it
that
--
the
fact
that
bridgaman,
the
landlord
was
there
and
as
the
district
court
found,
not
only
consented,
but
requested
that
the
officers
go
in
and
have
no
consequence.
now,
we
say
that
bridgaman's
presence
there
and
his
authorization
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
i
feel
like
i
can
fairly
say
that
if
he
had
not
been
present
and
given
his
authorization,
if
the
police
had
on
their
own
gone
in,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
there
are
a
--
a
couple
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
it
would
have
been
in
the
--
in
this
pattern
of
the
taylor
case,
the
agnello
case,
the
jones
case,
more
recently.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
jeffers
--
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
it
--
yes,
that's
--
i
suppose
a
bedrock
principle
of
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
what
do
you
mean,
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
either
the
united
states
attorney
wouldn't
have
taken
the
case.
the
district
court
would
have
suppressed
the
evidence
or
if
failing
all
else,
the
court
of
appeals
would've
reversed
a
conviction.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that
is
it.
and
before
i
get
to
that,
i
would
like
point
out
--
mr.
justice
black
raised
questions
as
to
georgia
law
on
this.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
under
federal
law
--
yes,
the
--
the
close
in
which
is
still
is
--
is
forfeitable.
the
land
is
forfeitable
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
not
in
that
way,
your
honor.
he
--
his
land
would
be
subject
to
forfeiture
though
under
federal
law,
if
he
knew
of
the
use.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
knew
of
that
uses
a
still
and
did
nothing
about
it,
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
if
he
wants
to
save
his
property.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
for
forfeiture
purposes,
i
think
it's
only
necessary
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
that
it'd
be
shown
that
he
know,
suffered
it
to
be.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
suffered
it
--
well,
failure
to
report,
i'm
not
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
this
is
the
general
forfeiture
statute.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
that's
a
different
one.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right.
there
is
provision
in
the
law
for
remission
to
innocent
lien
holders,
if
they
satisfy
certain
requirements.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
was
just
coming
to
that
one.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
in
connection
with
justice
black's
question
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
under
the
federal
statute?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
haven't
looked
into
the
cases
on
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
mere
failure
to
report
would
be
enough.
under
--
i
do
know
this,
however,
that
under
georgia
law,
he
would
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
there
is
a
--
i
want
to
call
this
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i'm
about
to
read
it,
mr.
justice
black.
58
ga.
code
105,
i
want
to
give
the
court
this
citation
because
it's
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
58
ga.
code
105,
"any
person
who
shall
let
or
suffer
any
other
person
--
persons,
firm
or
corporation
to
use
any
premises
which
he
owns
or
controls
for
the
illegal
sale,
keeping
for
sale,
manufacture
or
other
--
unlawful
disposition
of
the
liquors
and
beverages
mentioned
in
section
58,
101
and
that's
all
the
--
shall
be
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor."
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
let
or
suffer.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
any
person
to
use
any
premises
he
owns
or
controls
for
manufacture
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
that's
pretty
broad
language
in
the
statute.
i
--
i
haven't
looked
at
the
cases
under
it.
suffer,
i
--
i
think
would
probably
include
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
allowing
him
that
to
--
allowing
him
to
continue
with
knowledge
that
is
being
done.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
suffer,
there's
nothing
about
it.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
he
did
not
thing
further
about
it?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
suppose
the
georgia
law
enforcement
authorities
would've
allowed
him
a
little
time
to
put
a
stop
to
it.
it
takes
some
steps
to
put
a
stop
to
it.
that
--
i
--
i
mean,
i
don't
think
immediately
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
sir?
well,
in
addition,
again
referring
to
georgia
law,
"any
house,
any
room
or
structures
used
for
the
unlawful
manufacture
sale
--
keeping
for
sale
or
other
unlawful
disposition
of
liquors
shall
--
is
declared
to
be
a
common
nuisance."
that
section
is
cited
in
our
brief,
that's
in
58
ga.
code
109.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
common
nuisance.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
it's
subject
--
and
the
place
is
subject
--
the
nuisance
is
subject
to
abatement,
the
place
is
subject
to
be
padlocked.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
oh,
this
reminds
me
of
--
excuse
me,
i
may
have
defer
on
your
question,
just
a
moment.
finally,
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
section
of
the
georgia
code
which
is
most
pertinent
here
and
is
quoted
on
page
2
of
our
brief
and
it
provides
that
--
it's
58
ga.
code
106,
providing
that,
"the
unlawful
manufacture
sale
or
keeping
for
sale
or
disposition
of
liquor
contrary
to
law
of
state,
shall
at
the
option
of
the
landlord
work
a
forfeiture
of
the
rights
of
any
lessee
or
tenant
at
the
option."
i
guess,
i
read
that,
"shall
at
the
option
of
the
landlord
work
a
forfeiture
of
the
rights
of
any
lessee
or
tenant."
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
it
bears
very
much,
your
honor,
upon
bridgaman's
rights
in
what
he
did
about
them.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
in
the
injunction
with
the
rights
of
landlords
which
have
come
down
to
us
in
a
century
back,
the
right
of
entry
on
his
premises,
right
to
enter
his
premises.
and
the
specific
right
given
in
by
georgia
law
to
forfeit
and
the
--
the
nuisance
provision
which
i
read
and
in
the
misdemeanor
provision
which
i
read
whereby
he,
had
he
allowed
to
continue
would've
been
guilty
of
a
crime,
this
whole
bundle
of
interest,
obligations
and
rights
and
in
bridgaman,
the
landlord
here,
we
think
did
give
him
the
right
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
to
go
in
as
he
did
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
through
the
window.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
so
--
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
cannot
give
you
a
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
cases.
they're
cited
in
our
brief,
page
15,
top
of
the
page,
involving
suits
by
tenants
against
landlords
for
trespass
toward
whatnot.
and
everyone
in
those
cases
affirms
the
right
of
a
landlord
to
enter
his
premises,
to
view
waste
of
this
court
way,
way
back
into
common
law.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
in
waste.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
now
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
there
is
a
qualification
in
--
the
quotation
from
tiffany
on
landlord
and
tenant
which
we
cited
in
our
brief.
he
says
that
the
landlord
has
the
right
to
go
into
his
premises
to
view
waste
that
is
to
see
if
waste
is
being
committed,
provided
at
least,
that
it
does
not
involve
a
breaking.
and
then
there
is
talking
in
the
six
carpenters
case
about
the
landlord,
if
he
breaks
entry,
if
he
makes
a
lawful
entry,
then
he
is
guilty
of
trespass
ab
initio.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
in
the
circumstance
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
of
this
case,
yes.
and
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
a
little
more
of
those
facts
as
the
--
as
--
as
the
context,
the
background.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
i
--
i
do
not
think
it
was
a
breaking
by
bridgaman,
no.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
raising
an
unlocked
window.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
oh,
on
the
part
of
somebody
else,
yes.
a
stranger
to
the
transaction
is
stranger
to
the
deal.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
a
stranger
to
the
lease.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
not.
now,
you're
referring
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
bridgaman
who
raised
this
unlocked
window,
but
one
of
the
policemen.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
--
it's
true,
it
--
it
was
one
of
the
policemen
who
--
who
raised
the
window.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
we
don't
claim
anymore
right
for
him
than
the
--
than
bridgaman
had.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
right.
and
that's
the
crux,
the
nub
of
this
case
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
the
entry.
it's
the
--
it's
the
beginning
and
--
but
i
--
i
want
to
include
in
the
beginning
what
bridgaman
had
seen
first
before
he
called
the
police.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
and
it's
also
the
end
of
our
problem.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
i
--
i've
been
trying
to
give
a
--
the
court
a
few
more
facts
not
mentioned
by
my
opponent
in
his
recital.
then
it
was
shortly
stated,
bridgaman's
--
this
is
the
sentence,
"birdgaman's
church
was
having
a
visitation
that
day
and
his
pastor
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
a
visitiation.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
you
know
going
after,
called
on
people
to
ask
them
to
come
to
church.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
his
pastor
asked
him
to
call
on
a
certain
family
and
bridgaman
said,
"well,
some
new
tenants
have
moved
into
my
house
down
on
the
herbert
smart
road
and
i
will
call
on
him
and
then
i'll
call
on
this
other
party.
he
did
--
he
went
down
to
the
house
and
--
i
think
the
best
thing
to
do
is
read
it,
"so
we
went
down
there,"
currently
on
another
parishioner
is
whether
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
page
72,
excuse
me.
so
we
went
down
there
to
my
house
to
visit
these
people
and
they
had
shades
up
to
the
windows
and
all
of
the
shades
was
down,
but
we
knocked
at
the
door,
nobody
come
to
the
door,
so
i
smelled
an
awful
scent
around
there
and
i
just
note
what
it
was
by
smelling
it.
i
smelled
it
before
i
got
to
the
house
and
i
walked
around
the
house.
it
has
a
basement
in
the
bottom
and
not
closed
in,
just
an
open
basement.
i
looked
in
there
and
wasn't
--
nothing
in
there
and
so,
we
went
on
the
back
and
made
this
other
visit.
and
i
went
to
the
house
and
i
picked
up
the
telephone
and
i
called
the
officers
and
told
them
what
i
thought
as
there.
and
they
said,
"we'll
--
well,
if
you
stay
at
the
house,
we'll
be
there
in
15
minutes."
now,
let's
go
back
to
chance's
testimony.
he's
the
revenue
agent
who
bridgaman
called,
the
state
revenue
agent.
chance
said
when
bridgaman
called
him,
he
said
that
if
you
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
got
there
by
5
o'clock
--
this
is
page
8,
excuse
me.
if
you
got
out
there
by
5
o'clock,
he
would
carry
me
and
show
me
a
still.
chance
picked
up
harbin,
a
county
policeman
who
has,
under
georgia
law,
the
powers
of
a
sheriff.
and
en
--
en
route,
chance
--
or
bridgaman
told
them
that
he
owned
the
house.
he
went
down
there
to
invite
the
newcomers
to
church
and
he
found
out
there
was
a
--
that's
the
bottom
of
the
page.
and
he
found
out
that
there
was
the
still
in
there
and
he
came
back
and
called
us
and
went
with
us
down
there.
harbin's
testimony
is
to
the
same
effect.
he
is
the
county
--
the
county
policeman.
and
then
when
they
got
there,
the
conditions
were
still
the
same,
nobody
there,
all
quiet
around
the
house,
shades
down.
and
incidentally,
--
my
opponent
had
referred
to
the
pictures
that
are
with
the
exhibits.
he
asks
if
it's
true,
there
are
interior
and
exterior
views.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
there
are
interior
and
exterior
views,
pictures
in
the
--
with
the
exhibits
and
they
show
how
--
the
interior
views
show
how
tight
the
--
the
shades
were
drawn
and
they
even
showed
that
there
was
a
shade
tucked
up
over
the
little
glass
windows
at
the
--
in
the
upper
portion
of
the
front
door.
everything
was
closely
shaded
so
that
nobody
outside
could
see
inside.
and
incidentally,
in
that
connection,
i
want
to
say
that
this
is
a
--
obviously,
a
--
a
house
designed
for
dwelling,
yes.
it's
a
--
it's
a
modest
one-room
house
--
one
store,
one
room
--
one-storey
house
appears
to
be
built
of
cinder
block.
and
i
want
to
also
point
out
that
this
was
not
a
city
street.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
rather
secluded
location
close
to
this
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
outside
of
macon,
georgia.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
don't
know.
the
record
doesn't
show
how
far
out
it
was
but
the
house
was
setback
200
to
300
feet
from
the
road
and
it
--
the
picture
show
that
it's
a
--
a
wooded
tall
pines
around
the
house.
it's
a
rather
secluded
spot
and
i
think
that
--
it's
--
that's
obviously
the
reason
chapman
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
it
was
not,
no,
by
chapman,
this
petitioner.
no,
it
was
used
only
for
a
still.
that's
the
only
thing
there
was
in
the
house.
it's
a
small
house,
living
room,
dining
room,
bathroom,
kitchen,
a
couple
of
bedrooms
off
the
side,
one
storey.
and
the
still
was
set
up
in
the
living
room.
and
with
the
baths,
it
was
650
gallon
still,
the
bath
held
1300
gallons
of
mash.
they
had
the
water
--
water
connections
running
into
the
bathroom.
there
was
a
pump
nailed
to
the
dining
room
floor.
one
of
the
partitions
has
been
torn
out
and
a
bathroom
partition
torn
out,
before
bridgaman's
house
was
pretty
seriously
damaged.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
hadn't
--
excuse
me
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
sir.
sir,
go
ahead.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
please
--
please
do.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
you
won't
find
the
words
"immediate
possession"
in
the
statutes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
in
--
at
page
2,
i
think
it
was,
we
refer
--
we
quote
the
sections
giving
the
landlord
the
right
to
forfeit
at
his
option,
the
rights
of
the
lessee.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
and
then
--
and
then
10
--
i
--
i
read
a
minute
ago,
10
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
looking
at
that,
109.58
ga.
code
109.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
it's
the
nuisance
--
we
don't
quote
it.
it's
cited.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
the
one
that
i
--
i
wanted
the
court
to
note
was
--
which
is
not
cited
or
quoted
in
our
brief
is
105,
the
misdemeanor
provision
applying
to
a
landlord
and
suffers
or
let
the
premises
to
be
used
use
for
manufacture
of
liquor.
well
now,
we've
got
them
to
the
house,
bridgaman,
chance
and
harbin.
they
walked
around,
conditions
were
the
same.
they
--
they
looked
around
the
house
for
a
way
to
get
in
and
harbin,
the
county
policeman,
found
that
one
of
the
--
saw
that
one
of
the
windows
was
unlocked
and
so
he
called
to
the
others
and
he
went
through
the
window
and
here
is
--
here
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
bridgaman,
the
landlord
and
--
and
harbin,
the
county
--
chance,
the
revenue
agent.
and
here
is
the
proof
of
some
putting
i
think.
harbin
testifies
--
you'll
find
this
at
the
bottom
of
page
46
after
he
testified
as
to
finding
the
unlocked
window.
"and
they'd
boosted
me
up
on
their
shoulders
and
i
went
in
the
house
and
found
this
still.i
told
chance
to
go
and
get
some
help
and
they
left."
bridgaman,
the
landlord
helped
the
policemen
through
the
window.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
said
before,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
wouldn't
be
here
if
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
were
this
case.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
oh,
he
has
--
i
--
we
--
we
think
he
has
--
we
start
with
one
basic
bedrock
uncontested
proposition
and
that
is
that
the
landlord
has
a
right
to
enter
of
his
house
to
view
waste,
to
collect
rent,
to
make
repairs,
to
stop
a
nuisance.
now,
we're
a
little
bit
--
we're
having
a
little
trouble
here
on
how
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
how
he
can
exercise
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
that
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
that
takes
a
lawsuit.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
if
there's
a
--
the
georgia
law
statutes
provide
that,
manner
of
abatements,
72
ga.
code
201,
202,
30
--
203,
provides
for
suit
by
--
suit
for
abatements
suppression
by
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
solicitor
general
of
the
circuit.
that's
why
i
was
called
for.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
--
i
--
to
mean
summarily?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
you
mean
house
like
this,
put
a
padlock
on
it?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
have
found
nothing
in
the
georgia
law
on
that.
i
--
i
have
found
this
though,
i
--
i
have
found
this,
that
where
officers
see,
the
georgia
law
does
require
that
--
were
--
when
officers
see
contraband.
there
was
a
case
on
slot
machines,
they're
--
they're
under
duty
then
in
there
to
take
it
and
i
--
and
--
and
these
officers,
once
they
were
inside
the
house,
were
under
duty
to
seize
this
still
forthwith.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
we're
not
in
there
yet.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
it
is
our
position
and
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
what
bridgaman
found
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
is
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
bridgaman
has
found
it
first
and
he
called
the
police.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
the
police
didn't
call
him.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
he
called
the
police
and
although
mr.
elliott
would
minimize
this,
i
think
that
bridgaman
was
concerned
about
his
house.
he
--
he
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
took
the
police
there
and
he
took
them
there.
why?i
think
he
took
them
there.
it's
fair
for
me
to
say
from
this
record
that
he
took
them
there
to
repossess
his
house
and
kick
these
people
out.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
call
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
our
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
no
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
fairly
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
and
we
--
we
--
our
position
is
that
he
did
have
the
right
summarily
to
go
in
by
the
best
means
he
could
find
and
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
think
the
landlord's
rights
of
entry
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
are
--
are
greater.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i'm
relying
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
that's
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
we
--
we
find
nothing
in
the
georgia
code
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
on
that.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
was
about
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
we've
--
we've
looked
at
it
and
couldn't
find
it.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
sir?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
yes.
we
quote
--
we
quote
tiffany,
"he
may
enter,
the
landlord
may
enter
to
view
waste,
that
is
to
determine
where
the
waste
has
been
committed,
provided
that
this
does
not
involve
the
breaking
of
windows
or
doors
--
provided
at
least
that
this
does
not
involve
the
breaking
of
windows
or
doors
or
to
post
a
notice
to
deny
him
liability
under
mechanic
lien
laws
and
so
forth."
he
can
--
well,
let's
leave
officer
and
so
forth.
he
may
no
doubt
enter
without
being
guilty
of
trespass
for
the
purpose
of
complying
with
police
and
sanitary
orders
and
regulations.
and
he
will
generally
be
exempt
from
liabilities
--
ability
for
acts
required
by
the
state
or
municipal
authority
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
oh,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
and
we've
got
--
we've
got
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
other
cases.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
the
same
is
true
for
me
too,
mr.
justice.
we've
got
these
cases
cited
on
--
we
don't
have
--
there's
not
a
georgia
case
among
them.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
california,
illinois,
d.c.,
new
york.
there
is
another
case
cited
in
our
brief,
martin
against
medlin,
dealing
with
implied
covenants
in
a
lease
hold
the
state.
there,
it
must
be
used
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
rented.
it
must
be
--
and
certainly
and
it
cannot
be
used
unlawfully
or
for
an
unlawful
purpose.
that
particular
case
involved
a
party
house.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
all
i
can
say
on
the
basis
of
my
reading
of
the
cases
is
that
they
sustained
in
suits
by
tenants
against
landlords.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
they
--
the
cases
sustained
--
these
are
cases
--
these
are
suits
by
tenants
against
landlords
and
they
sustained
the
right
of
the
landlord
to
enter.
now,
there's
--
is
one
--
they
--
they
don't
however
set
forth,
the
mode
of
entry
involved
by
the
landlord,
which
was
claimed
to
be
wrong
against
the
tenant.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
the
basis
of
the
lawsuit
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
certainly
not
--
certainly
not,
otherwise,
he
maybe
suing.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
the
--
the
right
and
this
is
recognized
in
the
law.
the
right
of
the
landlord
to
enter
implies
the
right
to
enter
against
the
will
of
the
tenant.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
quotes
that
i
have
found
to
that
is
in
the
allegations
in
white
against
thurber,
which
is
cited
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
in
the
allegations
of
the
plain
--
of
the
plaintiff
tenant.
in
white
against
thurber,
a
new
york
case,
cited
at
page
15
of
our
brief,
forcibly
and
wrongfully
against
the
will
of
the
plaintiff,
entered
upon
the
premises
and
took
down
the
wall
--
down
the
wall.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
the
--
the
landlord
was
directed
by
the
city
to
do
something
about
this
wall,
so
he
went
in
and
did
it.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
the
--
the
authority
had
--
the
direction
of
the
law
didn't
tell
him
how
to
go
about
it.
now
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
title?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
there
are
different
titles
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
58
ga.
code,
the
provisions
on
nuisances,
misdemeanor
and
the
right
of
the
landlord
to
forfeit
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--are
on
58.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
58,
title
58.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
title
58
and
the
provision
on
manner
of
abating
nuisances
are
in
title
72.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
--
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
get
that
out
yet
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
yes
--
yes
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
in
this
way
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
under
all
the
circumstances,
this
was
a
reasonable
search.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
on
the
basis
of
the
rights
of
the
landlord?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
on
the
matter
of
reasonableness
and
of
course,
this
is
the
--
this
is
the
--
of
the
state
officers
and
of
course,
this
is
the
test
under
elkins.
bridgaman,
the
landlord
took
them
to
his
house,
he
helped
them
through
the
window,
he
knew
what
was
in
there
and
obviously,
he
wanted
to
put
a
stop
to
it.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
he
was
interested
in
repossessing
his
house
and
it
seemed
to
it
that
it
was
to
be
--
the
wasted
any
further.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
he
said
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no.
he
said,
"i
know
of
what
was
in
there
by
smelling
it"
and
they
smelled
the
same
thing.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
on
a
warrant.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
on
a
warrant.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
right.
and
that
is
precisely
the
basis
on
which
we
do
defend
it,
your
honor.
i
have
said
twice
that
if
this
had
been
a
junket
by
these
officers
as
in
the
johnson
case
or
as
in
the
mcdonald
case,
on
their
own
without
more,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
the
law
of
georgia
is
very
important
here
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
because
part
of
the
picture
of
the
reasonableness
of
what
was
done.
now,
we
--
we
cannot
assume
on
this
record
that
these
officers
would
have
gone
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
the
--
the
georgia
law
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
there
are
georgia
statutes
which
are
relevant
on
this
question
of
reasonableness
which
i
had
related.
they're
part
of
the
total
picture
particularly
as
the
nuisance
provision
and
--
and
particularly
under
the
statute
on
--
on
bridgaman's
rights
as
a
landlord.
he
obviously
thought
that
he
had
a
right
to
go
in
as
he
did.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
it's
part
of
the
picture
of
reasonableness
and
he
--
and
the
officers
obviously
thought
that
he
had
a
right
to
allow
them
to
go
in,
to
tell
them
to
go
in.
that's
--
that's
clear
on
this
record.
and
so
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
points
out,
it
boils
down
to
whether
this
was
reasonable
action.
and
we
say
it
was
--
it
was
in
principle
and
in
substance,
an
entry
by
the
landlord
in
the
assertion
of
his
rights.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i'm
sure
that
--
that
the
landlord
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i'm
sure
that
the
landlord,
bridgaman
in
this
situation,
had
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
hadn't
been
opened
to
him,
which
is
inconceivable
since
all
there
was
in
the
house
was
a
still.
he
could've
said,
"get
out
here.
move!
you're
evicted."
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
he'd
have
to
go
to
court.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
but
his
mouth
would
not
be
shut
as
to
what
he
saw
in
there,
the
still.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
but
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
the
georgia
law
on
that
is
the
--
is
the
common
law.
there
is
no
--
the
--
i
don't
--
i
am
--
we
have
found
nothing
in
the
georgia
law
giving
a
landlord
the
right
to
go
through
a
window.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
but
he
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
but
he
has
the
right
that
is
centuries
old
to
enter
his
property,
to
view
waste
to
--
to
collect
rent,
to
make
repairs,
to
stop
a
nuisance.
that's
one
of
the
situations
in
which
tiffany
says,
"he
has
a
right
to
entry
--
enter."
and
certainly
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
there
was
a
nuisance
here,
a
very
grievous
nuisance.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that
was
said
even
in
trupiano.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
right.
well,
you've
taken
the
words
out
of
my
mouth,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
and
while
we
don't
cover
this
in
our
brief,
i
think
i
ought
to
touch
on
it.
let
us
suppose
--
let
us
suppose
that
bridgaman
exceeded
his
rights
in
view
of
the
discussion
here,
i
think
i
better
touch
on
this.let
us
suppose
that
bridgaman
exceeded
his
rights
when
he,
not
because
he
enters,
he
had
the
right
to
enter
and
he
had
the
right
to
enter
against
the
will
of
the
tenant.
but
he
exceeded
his
rights
in
the
mode
of
entry,
in
the
mode
of
entry.
that
at
most,
would
be
a
technical
trespass
against
the
rights
of
this
man,
chapman.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no,
it
doesn't
appear
that
it
was
cracked
at
all,
it
was
unlocked.
all
the
other
windows
were
locked.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
right.
and
i
assume
further
that
the
reason
they
could
see
it
was
unlocked
was
because
the
shade,
you
know,
normally
is
on
the
inside
of
the
locked
window.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
and
as
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
and
that
--
that,
i
agree.
and
as
i've
said,
this
was
in
substance
and
in
principle,
an
entry
by
bridgaman.
but
let
us
assume
that
he
overstepped
his
rights
in
the
manner
in
which
he
exercised
his
rights.
the
cases
in
this
court
had
not
allowed
the
admissibility
of
evidence
to
turn
on
such
technical
wrongs,
civil
wrongs.
i
refer
to
burdeau
against
mcdowell,
the
case
in
which
mcdowell's
papers
were
taken
out
of
his
office
by
private
persons
without
his
authorization
and
the
court
said
that
--
and
they
were
turned
over
to
the
united
states
attorney
for
prosecutions,
for
presentation
to
agree
in
jury.
the
court
said,
"we're
not
going
to
stop
to
consider
the
wrong
done
to
mcdowell
or
what
his
rights
or
remedies
maybe
against
the
wrongdoer."
in
the
mcguire
case,
the
agents
had
a
warrant,
search
warrant,
for
liquor
and
when
they
executed
the
warrant,
they
kept
to
court
and
destroyed
all
the
rest
and
it
was
claimed
that
this
made
them
trespasser
ab
initio,
because
the
destruction,
their
act
of
destroying
the
liquor
was
illegal
and
the
court
agreed
to
before
it
and
oppressed
it.
but
the
court
said,
"this
doesn't
affect
the
validity
of
the
search
for
and
the
seizure
of
and
retention
of
the
court
be
kept."
they
said
that
was
valid,
that
was
distinct
from
the
civil
wrong,
the
wrong
done
in
destroying.
and
more
recently,
in
on
lee,
the
court
reiterated
that
principle.
it
was
their
claim
that
you
recall,
that
was
the
case
of
the
informer
who
went
in
wired
the
sound,
radio
transmitter
into
on
lee's
laundry
and
engaged
them
in
conversation,
he
was
a
friend
of
on
lee
and
on
lee
made
the
incriminating
statements,
which
were
picked
up
on
the
radio
and
heard
by
an
agent
outside
who
had
the
receiving
sense.
and
it
was
contended
there
that
on
--
the
informer
was
either
a
--
a
trespasser
ab
initio
or
he
was
a
trespasser
when
he
went
in,
because
the
entry
was
fraudulent
as
against
on
lee.
and
the
court
said
there
that
the
mcguire
case
controls
the
question
and
that
what
--
whether
--
whether
the
informer's
conduct
was
unlawful
or
not,
this
did
not
affect
the
government's
right
to
use
the
evidence.
and
i
think
that
this
case
is
an
even
stronger
case
for
the
application
of
that
principle
because
there,
the
informer
who
was
guilty
of
betraying
his
friend's
confidence
was
acting
under
the
auspices
of
agents
who
sent
him
in
wired
for
sound.
here,
the
officers
wrecking
under
the
auspices
of
the
landlord
who
had
no
ulterior
motive,
whatever.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
it
was.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
true.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
true.
but
this
was
bridgaman's
house
and
he
had
rights
of
entry
as
a
landlord.
now,
i
think
we
can
test
--
test
the
question
this
way,
test
the
principle.
supposing
--
let
us
suppose
that
bridgaman
in
good
faith,
on
his
discovery,
had
resorted
to
self-help
or
--
or
had
gone
and
gotten
some
of
his
friends
to
help
him
and
he
and
his
friends
went
into
the
house
the
same
way.
there
would
be
--
chapman
would
have
absolutely
no
right
to
complain
of
his
discovery
--
of
bridgaman's
discovery
of
his
chapman's
still,
in
bridgaman's
house.
and
bridgaman
would
be
free
to
--
to
testify
about
it,
testify
as
to
what
he
saw
at
the
still.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
under
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
yes.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
here
if
had
been
a
stranger
to
the
house,
to
the
lease.
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes,
a
burglar,
sure.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
sir,
i
agree
--
i
agree.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
let
us
further
suppose
that
--
well,
of
course,
it
would've
been
foolhardy
on
bridgaman's
party
to
go
in
himself.
he
might've
subjected
himself
to
danger.
the
moonshiners
are
not
very
nice
people.
he
might
have
been
(inaudible)
so
what
is
he
--
what
he
did
he
do?
he
did
the
--
a
person,
he
did
--
he
did
the
thing
that
any
natural,
normal,
law
abiding
person
would
do.
he
went
to
get
the
police.
he
went
to
get
the
police
to
protect
him
and
to
aid
him
in
the
exercise
of
his
rights.
and
when
they
got
there,
he,
as
i
said
before,
helped
boost
harbin
on
his
shoulders
and
threw
the
window.
now,
let's
suppose
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
as
a
matter
of
fact,
bridgaman
did
testify
to
like
effect
as
the
officers,
as
to
what
he
saw
in
the
house.
after
harbin
got
in,
unlocked
the
door,
bridgaman
went
in
and
he
said
there,
it
was
all
piled
up
in
the
living
room.
that's
all
there
were,
that
was
in
this
house,
that
--
that
still
and
those
mash
beds,
but
to
get
back.
let
--
let's
suppose
that
when
they
--
when
they
got
to
the
house,
the
officers
--
and
bridgaman
says,
"go
on
in"
and
the
officers
emerged
and
said,
"well,
i
don't
know
of
whether
we
can
go
in,
but
you
can
go
in
or
maybe
you
can
go
in
as
landlord."
and
let's
suppose,
instead
of
harbin
being
boosted
through
the
window,
bridgaman
had
been
boosted
through
the
window.
now,
i
don't
--
he
then
had
--
it
was
his
house,
he
had
been
boosted
through.
he
could
have
then
opened
the
door,
called
the
officers
in
and
really
have
the
same
situation
has
actually
occurred
here.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
so,
the
landlord
going
into
his
own
house
not
withstanding
that
he
was
--
had
the
aid
and
the
protection
there
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
police
and
not
withstanding
that
he
and
they
may
have
had
in
mind
to
--
to
seize
a
still
and
--
and
catch
a
moonshiner.
i
think
that
makes
no
difference.
now,
the
short
of
it
is,
i
don't
think
that
this
--
the
validity
of
this
entry
and
that's
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
our
problem.
i
don't
think
its
validity
should
turn
on
who
went
in
the
window
first.
now,
mr.
--
finally,
mr.
elliott
said
that,
i
adverted
to
this
--
the
decision
which
we
asked
for
here,
putting
the
--
putting
tenants
to
the
--
at
the
mercy
of
landlords.
well,
that
is
not
so
at
all
and
we
had
an
answer
to
such
a
suggestion,
a
very
short
time
ago
in
the
abel
case.
the
--
i
think
we
can
depend
upon
the
federal
courts
and
upon
this
court
to
be
alert,
to
prevent
any
abuse
of
the
rights
of
landlords
to
enter
and
to
take
in
--
enter
their
premises
and
to
take
in
police
with
them.
if
there's
collusion
to
circumvent
constitutional
restrictions
on
law
enforcement,
then
it
will
be
time
to
call
a
halt
--
halt
and
those
matters,
if
they
should
arise,
should
--
will
depend
upon
the
evidence
and
the
concrete
findings
in
such
a
situation.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
the
consent
of
abel
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
let
this
owner.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
to
let
the
owner
in?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
don't
understand.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
two
segments
to
abel.
the
--
the
wastebasket
part
and
the
earlier
part
which
occurred
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
immigration
officers.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
oh,
no.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
no.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right.
that's
what
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
think
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
in
abel?
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
i
don't
recall
that
the
landlord,
the
hotel
keeper,
the
innkeeper
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
oh,
oh,
yes.
yes.
i
would
--
that's
why
--
yes,
the
wastebasket
in
part
of
the
--
yes,
but
i
mean
on
the
entry.
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
the
hotelkeeper.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
that's
right.
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
yes.
the
fbi
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
--
turned
it
over
to
--
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
--
i
used
abel,
mr.
chief
justice,
only
in
answer
to
mr.
elliott's
suggestion
that
the
decision
we
asked
for
here
would
open
wide
the
opportunities
or
allusion
between
landlords
and
police
whereby,
they
could
snoop
and
get
evidence
on
tenants
and
landlords
that
walk
in,
take
the
police
with
them.
i
say
that
only
for
the
proposition
that
it
--
those
cases
should
be
taken
cared
of,
if
they
should
arise
and
on
the
basis
of
the
particular
evidence
because
after
all,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
a
while
ago,
"in
all
these
questions,
you
always
come
back
to
the
question
of
reasonableness,
in
all
the
circumstances."
mr.
robert
s.
erdahl
well,
i
intended
to
get
to
it
mr.
justice
[laughs]
