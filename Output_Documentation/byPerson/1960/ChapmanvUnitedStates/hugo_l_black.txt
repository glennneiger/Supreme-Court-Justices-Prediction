i'm

suppose
a
hotel
manager
goes
by
rooms
and
has
every
reasonable
ground
in
the
world
to
believe
that
the
law
is
being
violated
in
that
room
at
that
moment,
maybe
assault
or
whatever
--
whatever
it
may
be,
does
he
have
any
right
at
all
to
go
in
there
without
waiting
for
a
search
warrant
if
he's
the
manager
of
the
hotel?
justice

black
yes.
justice

l.
black
that's
right.
justice

well,
suppose

suppose
there
was
no
one
there,
but
there
were
some
way
he
could
reasonably
believe

any

all
doubt
that
they
were
--
a
law
was
actually
being
violated
in
his
hotel
room
that
that
--
justice

l.
black
but
where
there
circumstances
there,
sufficient
to
show
the
conclusion
that
i
assumed
in
the
question
i
asked
you.
as
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
recall
it,
the
nearest
to
your
case,
i
--
i
maybe
wrong,
but
the
nearest
evidence
to
your
case
was
one
from
out
in
the
west
where
they
smell
opium
coming
from
the
room.
i
don't
remember.
i
believe
that
was
johnson.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
starting
to
ask
you
one
other
which
you
didn't
explain
here,
to
point
out
to
the
question
as
to
whether
anyone
is
there
or
not.
suppose
the
manager
of
the
hotel
went
by
and
he
smells
smoke
coming
from
the
room
and
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
his
room
had
been
set
on
fire
in
the
hotel
[laughs].
will
he
have
a
right
to
go
win?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
--
then
it
gets
down
to
your
judgment
whether
or
not,
it's
a
compelling
circumstance.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
warrants.
i'm
talking
about
an
owner's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
(voice

the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
of
course,
i
assume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
assume
if
it
was
true,
i
don't
know
that
his
property
to
be
forfeited
for
having
a
still
in
it
but
that
would
be
a
--
and
he
knew
it
was
there.
he'd
have
some
kind
of
right
either
to
go
in
there,
get
somebody
else
in
there
on
the
ground
that
you
couldn't
have
any
greater
waste
of
your
property
that
have
it
forfeited
to
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
i
didn't
mean
merely
the
georgia
law,
i
meant
the
federal
laws
as
reference
of
forfeiture
or
any
law,
i
don't
know.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
duty
under
federal
law
on
the
part
of
the
owner
to
do
anything
about
it?
justice

black
you
mean
if
he
knew
it
and
did
not
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.

well,
then
i
suppose
that
would
equivalent
to
a
duty.
justice

is
it
the

under

they
used

seize

you

you

the
nuisance?
alright.
justice

may
i
ask
you
what
provision
of
the
georgia
--
i
summed
up
and
got
the
georgia
code,
according
to
your
citation.
they
sent
me
to
code
on
evidence,
that's
the
number
of
which
you
referred.
what's
--
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
title
of
the
georgia
code
is
it
that
i
can
find?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
says
--
you
have
at
58
ga.
code.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
they
made
a
mistake,
they
sent
me
38
[laughs],
you
said,
58.
justice
hugo
l.
black
title
58.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
the
case
you
argued,
mr.
erdahl,
johnson
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
sometime
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
court
had
that
question
that
--
do
you
think
that
in
--
in
connection
with
the
smell
of
opium?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
was
held
that
odor
could
be
enough
to
make
a
search.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
got
a
search
warrant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
than
you
should
present
that
to
the
judge
or
the
magistrate,
he
might
give
a
search
warrant.
so
that
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
it's
against
you
is
it
not,
unless
you
do
depend
on
the
right
of
the
landlord
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
do
what
was
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
the
law
of
georgia
is
what
controlled
as
to
whether
the
landlord
had
a
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
do
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
well,
that's
just
been
shown
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
assume
that
there's
a
valid
law
of
georgia,
which
authorizes
a
landlord
to
do
that
under
these
circumstances
and
that
--
that
settled
the
question
of
reasonableness,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
not
settle
it
under
the
federal
law.
it
might
conceive
of
them,
they
might
not,
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you
because
you're
defending
on
georgia
law
as
to
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
brings
you
back
to
where
they
had
the
right,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
find
it
a
little
difficult
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
find
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
a
little
difficult
to
say
it
was
reasonable
if
he
--
or
either
one
of
them
to
do
it,
if
it's
against
the
law
for
him
to
do
what
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
in
law,
one
state
or
even
the
state
of
the
federal
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you.
have
you
cited
any
cases
which
showed
--
tell
the
--
what
is
the
georgia
law
with
reference
to
the
right
of
a
landlord
to
enter
a
house,
if
he
finds
that
the
law
had
been
violated
in
it,
in
a
way
that
may
entail
some
kind
of
guilt
and
--
and
put
some
kind
of
guilt
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
cases
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
that
code.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
this
was,
if
it
was
being
used
for
that
purpose,
a
nuisance
under
georgia
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
known
that
this
was
being
used
for
that
purpose
and
had
not
reported
it,
what
would've
been
his
liability
under
georgia
law
for
that
nuisance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
have
before
me,
one
of
the
cases
cited.
it
says,
"they
have
considered
it

reached
the
conclusion

is
that
your

--
justice
hugo

black

is
it
your
understanding
of
the
law
that
--
justice

--
that
a
guilt
and
knowledge
of
the
use
of
his
premises
by
landlord,
use
of
his
premises
for
manufacturing
liquor,
would
subject
his
property

seizure

the

he
knew
about
it

and
made
no
report
of
it.

have
you
