did
you
said
--
when
did
you
say
the
committee
had
done
nothing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
did
you
--
you
said
something
about
the
committee
not
being
active
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
who
prosecuted
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
attorney
general
didn't
prosecute
it.
who
did
prosecute
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
attorney
general
appeared
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
no
relevance,
i
suppose,
but
(inaudible)
do
you
mean
that,
from
the
state
supreme
court,
the
attorney
general
leaves
all
the
tenant
work
to
the
--
the
county
attorney?
justice

what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
were
you
reading
from
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
you
read
from
one
of
our
opinions
about
the
court
presuming
that
congress
was
not

page
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
--
may
i
ask
you,
suppose
they
did
tell
them
that
and
suppose
a
court
of
pleas
court
in
franklin
county
had
previously
held
that.
would
that
ever
stop
the
county
prosecuting
attorney
from
prosecuting
them
with
the
supreme
court's
interpretation
that
they
did
not
--
that
the
--
that
it
gave
to
the
act?
how
would
they
know
that
the
supreme
court
would
hold
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
was
a
room
for,
and
there
was,
a
very
sharp
cited
opinion,
mr.
putman.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
unreasonable
about
the
lawyers
telling
her
that
you
can't
rely
on
this
judge
--
this
one
opinion
of
this
one
judge
when
this
is
a
committee
of
a
--
of
a
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it
been
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it
been
a
very
--
wasn't
it
have
been
a
very
natural
advise
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
for
a
lawyer
to
give
this
to
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
is
that
the
only
question?
if
the
record
shows
that
the
law,
as
it
then
stood,
remind
that
90%
of
the
lawyers,
for
instance,
did
not
grant
the
power
to
grant
immunity,
why
were
they
compelled
to
act
on
the
basis
that
the
supreme
court
would
hold
the
contrary,
if
the
record
shows
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
due
process
requires
a
fair
proceeding
before
anybody
goes
to
jail,
i
suppose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
record
does
show
that,
as
i
understand,
they
put
on
the
stand,
they
were
told,
you
have
immunity.
the
lawyer
took
the
position,
we
don't
have
it.
although
one
judge
has
said
so,
we
don't
know
that
at
all,
and
they
still
refuse
to
answer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
under
the
law
as
a
normal
person
would
have
read
it
in
ohio.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
have
incriminated
them.
i
mean,
they
--
they
couldn't
know
that
they
wouldn't
be
prosecuted
if
they
admitted
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
might
be
a
difference,
might
there
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
a
case
where
you
want
to
--
you've
got
to
prove
that
some
person
will
willfully
do
it
and
something,
you
have
to
do
prove
that
in
ohio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
they
willfully
defied
the
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
could
be
done
to
the
person
who
does
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
in
jail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
there's
much
--
much
difference
what
they
call
it,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
result
is
they
could
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
put
in
jail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
could
have
been
if
the
court
hadn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
contrary
to
the
dissenters'
view,
which
sounded
rather
natural
and
normal
view
to
me,
if
they
hadn't,
contrary
to
his
view,
held
that
it
meant
that
they
conclude
something
besides
what
it
said
on
its
face.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
i
--
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
your
presentation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
franklin
county
case
published?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
one
where
the
report
was
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
not
published
in
the
record,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
there
was
a
note
to
them
from
one
of
you
after
the
case
was
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
may
not
be
material,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i'd
like
to
see
them
myself.
