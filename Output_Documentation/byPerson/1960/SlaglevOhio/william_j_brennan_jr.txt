justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mrs.
furry,
what
--
what
relevance
does
that
have
to
whether
or
not
the
committee
might
investigate
after
our
decision
in
the
uphaus
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they
did,
in
fact,
recommend
legislation
which
was
in
fact
passed,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
shows
that
the
attorney
general
of
ohio
has
not
--
for
one
reason
or
another,
he
has
not
thought
it
was
unenforceable,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
--
when
raley
was
here,
was
it
not
the
county
prosecutors
who
appeared
in
those
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mrs.
furry,
before
you
do,
may
i
just
ask
one
question.
raley
involved
what
the
court
--
this
court
said
was
an
improper
representation
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
to
the
witnesses
that
they
might
rely
on
their
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
is
that
issue
involved
in
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
had
these
witnesses
involved
before
us
now,
been
told
that
the
statute
--
the
ohio
statute
extended
immunity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
judge's
opinion
was
that
there
would
be
immunity
for
prosecution
for
any
testimony
they
gave?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
take
the
position
here
that
raley,
in
any
way,
governs
the
problems
before
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
didn't
your
supreme
court,
however,
mrs.
furry,
in
--
i've
forgotten,
was
it
the
morgan
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hold
that
the
statute
was
automatically
available?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
that
there
was
no
obligation
affirmatively
to
advise
a
witness
that
immunity
was
available,
that
the
statute
was
automatically
available
but
in
raley,
we
found
that
the
chairman
of
the
commission
supplied
everyone
but
stern,
i
think,
did
it
not,
had
--
had
told
the
witnesses
that
they
were
free
to
claim
their
privilege
whenever
they
thought
it
advisable
to
do
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
morgan
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mrs.
furry,
do
i
correctly
understand
then
that
we
--
your
position
is
we
must
reach
the
arguments
or
rather
attacks
upon
the
proceedings
that
we
did
not
reach
in
raley
because
there
is
not
present
here
a
situation
such
as
there
was
in
raley,
namely,
of
the
chairman
having
misadvised
the
witnesses
that
they
might
rely
on
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
--
it's
only
by
implication,
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suggested
it.
in
other
words
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there
was
no
expressed
statement
as
was
true
in
the
morgan
and
raley
cases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
you
may
rely
on
the
privilege.
that,
we
do
not
have
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you
have
--
what
you're
relying
on
is
an
affirmance
by
necessity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
of
a
precedent
that
is,
is
another
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
putman.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
issues
are
before
us
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
laying
aside
your
reliance,
if
you
will,
upon
the
equally
divided
vote
in
stern
as
settling
the
validity
of
the
commission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
we
have
to
isolate
the
questions
as
to
each
of
the
five
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
were
the
sentences,
concurrent
on
all
those
counts
as
to
which
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
any
one
is
good.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
each
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
we
have
to
consider
each
of
these
sentences
on
each
of
the
five
witnesses
on
--
if
it
doesn't
show
that
they're
concurrent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
sound
to
me
as
if
you
thought
the
immunity
ought
to
extend
to
both
federal
and
state
prosecution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
mean
to
embarrass
you.
i
just
say
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
very
resourceful.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
speaking
for
myself,
i
think
that
would
be
very
helpful,
mr.
putman,
because
it's
quite
impossible
on
what's
presented
to
us
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
it
in
campton?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
--
i
thought
--
i
thought
your
supreme
court
said
that
an
offer
of
immunity
was
unnecessary
that,
automatically,
the
statute
accorded
immunity
without
offer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
did
the
--
was
that
--
was
that
the
gist
also
of
the
franklin
county
common
pleas
decision?
