mr.
thelma
c.
furry
if
the
court
please?
this
is
--
is
a
matter,
involving
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission,
during
the
time
that
it
was
in
existence
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
calling
witnesses
before
it.
since
that
time
that
commission
has
gone
out
of
business,
but
some
time
ago
in
this
court
i
think
the
session
--
the
october
term
of
1958,
we
had
a
similar
matter
here
called
the
morgan
versus
the
state
of
ohio
and
raley
versus
the
state
of
ohio,
which
involved
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission.
at
that
time,
this
court
made
a
ruling
in
a
unanimous
decision,
eight
justices
participating,
that
in
order
for
a
witness
to
be
found
guilty
of
contempt
of
this
committee,
they
must
be
ordered
to
answer
the
questions.
as
a
result
of
that
decision,
there
were
19
cases
altogether
in
ohio
pending.
as
a
result
of
that
decision,
all
of
the
cases
were
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals
level
in
the
various
counties
throughout
the
state
of
ohio,
franklin
county,
summit
county
and
we
have
the
county
of
course,
that
was
here,
except
that
in
stark
county,
there
were
five
defendants
involved.
there,
although
those
cases
had
been
pending,
waiting
the
decision
of
the
morgan
case,
the
stark
county
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
--
that
they
did
not
feel
that
this
case
was
binding
upon
them,
that
the
morgan
case
was
binding
upon
them,
and
they
maintained
the
convictions.
the
case
was
then
taken
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
at
which
time
they
--
without
opinion,
merely
stated
that
there
were
no
constitutional
questions
involved
and
they
refused
to
consider
the
question.
now,
how
is
this
case
involving
the
five
defendants
different
from
the
cases
that
were
before
this
--
or
court
before
and
from
the
cases
that
were
reversed
in
the
other
counties?
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
in
his
brief,
claims
that
all
five
witnesses
were
present
when
the
commission
in
--
in
the
hearing
room,
when
the
commission
stated
that
there
was
an
immunity
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio
and
that
there
had
been
a
decision
rendered
and
therefore,
when
the
chairman
made
the
statement
that
this
was
notice
to
all
five
witnesses,
that
they
were
being
granted
immunity.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
the
state
of
--
supreme
court
in
ohio
said
that
in
the
morgan
case.
they
said
that
when
a
witness
walks
into
a
hearing,
they
are
immediately
clothed
with
immunity.
that
is
the
gist
of
the
decision
in
the
state
of
ohio.
that
was
the
majority
opinion,
without
any
reference
or
any
immunity
being
granted
to
the
witnesses.
now,
at
the
time
that
these
witnesses
were
in
stark
county
before
this
commission,
this
was
on
october
of
--
21st
day
of
october,
1953.
on
october
the
13th,
1953,
a
common
pleas
judge
in
franklin
county
came
forth
with
this
decision,
first
--
for
the
first
time,
was
the
question
about
immunity
raised.
now,
when
these
witnesses
were
before
this
commission
in
stark
county,
this
was
prior
to
the
state
supreme
court's
decision
on
the
immunity
statute.
so
that
when
the
chairman
mentioned
to
the
witness,
i
think
the
question
was
the
along
this
line,
“did
your
counsel
point
you
with
the
fact
that
the
judge
--
that
there
has
been
a
decision
that
there
is
an
immunity
statute
in
the
state
of
ohio?”
i
think
the
--
one
witness
that
they
said
that
to,
said
something
to
the
effect,
well,
that's
one
judge's
opinion.
and
then
later
on,
the
counsel
for
the
commission
themselves
said
this
in
page
92
of
the
record,
when
the
witness,
mrs.
perry
refused
to
answer
a
question,
counsel
further
commission
said,
“well,
i
may
point
out
that
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
franklin
county
has
ruled
otherwise,
but
as
you
state
in
your
opinion,
that
is
just
one
man's
view.”
as
i
started
to
say,
this
immunity
statute
ruling
of
the
franklin
county
court
was
mentioned
to
two
witnesses,
when
they
were
before
the
commission.
the
other
--
this
was
an
open
hearing
of
course.
the
other
five
witnesses
may
have
been
in
the
room
or
they
may
not
have
been.
they
may
have
been
able
to
hear
it
or
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
hear
it,
i
don't
know.
the
record
certainly
does
not
state
that
they
heard
this
reference
to
the
immunity
statute.
nevertheless,
i
maintain
that
even
though
there
was
a
reference
to
a
common
pleas'
decision
about
this
immunity
statute,
this
commission
at
no
time,
offered
any
witness
immunity
and
went
on
and
said,
“you
are
automatically
given
immunity
if
you
answer
these
questions.”
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
this
--
the
petitioners
here
are
--
include
all
five.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
all
five
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
--
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
and
of
course,
as
we
pointed
out
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
that
even
if
they
go
by
the
very
strictest
construction
of
this
court,
that
there
must
be
a
direction
to
answer
which
even
the
four-to-four
decision
put
the
states
in
its
opinion,
there
were
two
opinions
here
in
the
morgan,
raley
case.
there
was
a
four-to-four
decision
that
one
of
the
witnesses,
mr.
stern
from
cincinnati,
was
guilty
because
he
was
ordered
to
answer
in
spite
of
the
immunity
statute.
so
that
we
say
that
if
you
stick
to
that
very
narrow
and
strict
ruling
by
this
court
that
the
test
is,
i
think
the
language
of
this
court
is
in
that
portion
of
the
decision,
this
court
says,
"the
test
is
where
the
witness
was
commanded
to
answer
regardless."
so,
let's
say,
we
take
that
very
strict
sentence.
we
maintain
that
the
least
the
ohio
supreme
court
should
have
done,
was
to
have
released
two
of
these
witnesses,
who
had
never
been
directed
to
answer
any
question
that
was
in
the
indictment,
that
the
--
any
question
they
were
indicted
upon.
i
may
point
out
that
at
the
--
in
my
brief
and
i
think
also
in
prosecutor's
brief,
we
both
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
were
only
two
witnesses
are
directed
to
answer
questions
--
of
questions
that
where
they
were
indicted
upon,
but
we
just
discovered
today
that
actually
there
were
three
witnesses
who
had
been
directed
to
answer
a
question.
now,
i'm
just
discussing
the
very
narrow
issue
that
was
decided
by
this
court
in
the
morgan
case.
so,
taking
it
at
its
most
narrow
stage,
two
witnesses
should
have
to
have
reversed
convictions
here,
even
though
the
other
three
were
directed
to
answer.
of
course,
our
contention
is,
the
petitioner's
contention
is
that
in
as
much
as
they
were
never
offered
immunity
and
in
as
much
as
the
ohio
supreme
court
have
not
yet
made
a
ruling
on
this
immunity
statute,
that
they
were
not
bound
or
were
not
covered
by
immunity.
the
case
decided
by
the
morgan
case
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
the
first
one
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
ever
held
or
ever
made
any
interpretation
of
the
ohio
immunity
statute.
we
had
no
interpretation
of
this
statute
prior
to
that
and
of
course,
that
was
after
the
canton
hearings.
now
then,
the
other
point
that
we
make
in
our
petition
for
this
court,
it
makes
this
case
different
from
the
other
cases
before
the
ohio
commission,
at
the
time
that
this
--
these
witnesses
were
before
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
in
canton,
the
ohio
legislature
had
passed
a
law
on
the
recommendations
of
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission,
for
the
--
for
the
purposes
that
this
commission
was
set
up
--
set
up
for,
had
been
accomplished.
and
in
the
record
of
the
trial
of
these
witnesses
in
the
common
pleas
court,
on
page
45
by
a
record
here,
the
trial
counsel
asked
the
chairman
mr.
devine,
chairman
of
the
ohio
un-american
committee.
he
said,
“you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
investigate
and
pass
legislation
or
to
recommend
the
passage?
now,
isn't
it
true
that
the
time
of
this
particular
investigation,
there
had
been
a
law
already
recommended
and
passed
from
the
very
subject
upon,
which
this
commission
was
attempting
to
act
here
in
this
community?”
the
answer
is,
“yes,
sir.”
the
question
then
says,
mr.
hilton,
the
defense
counsel,
"that
as
far
as
passing
legislation,
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
committee
here,
was
it?”
the
chairman,
mr.
devine's
answer
is,
"to
pass
legislation?"
mr.
hilton
says,
“yes.”
mr.
devine
says,
“no,
that
wasn't
the
purpose
of
the
committee
here.”
now,
that
goes
on
a
little
further
with
the
conversation
back
and
forth,
but
we
maintain
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
of
the
trial
record
and
its
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
trial
in
the
common
pleas
court
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
--
and
it's
in
page
45
of
the
record
here,
before
the
court.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
now,
i
say
to
this
court
that
this
comes
into
where
the
points
that
we've
raised
in
this
case,
that
actually
this
committee
was
acting
without
any
authority
whatsoever,
when
subpoenaed
these
witnesses
to
begin
with,
beside
the
point
of
directing
answers
and
beside
the
point
of
the
immunity
statute.
they
were
not
functioning
for
any
legitimate
reason.
the
chairman
says
the
legislation
had
been
passed,
that
they
had
recommended.
we
state
that
ab
initio
these
hearings,
this
commission's
route
was
without
authority
and
the
record
will
show
that
in
various
places
when
the
witnesses
asked,
“why
are
these
questions
being
asked
of
me,
what
--
how
is
it
pertinent
to
the
purposes
of
this
committee
and
so
forth,”
this
commission
never
made
a
statement
to
any
witness,
as
to
why
they're
being
asked
the
questions
or
to
why
the
questions
were
pertinent
to
the
matter
before
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
trial
court
themselves,
in
finding
these
witnesses
guilty
of
some
of
the
indictments
and
reversing
some
of
the
indictments
stated
in
their
opinion,
the
trial
court
in
his
opinion
had
made
a
question
that
were
vague,
double
barreled,
immaterial,
even
the
questions
of
the
indictments.
and
we
say
that
the
type
of
questions
that
were
asked
to
these
people
were
the
kind
of,
“when
have
you
stopped
beating
your
wife?”
the
attorney
for
the
commission
would
start
out
with,
“isn't
it
a
fact
and
i
state
it's
a
fact,
that
you
were
present
at
such
and
such
committee
that
such
and
such
a
communist
meeting,
how
do
you
answer
that,
yes
or
no?”
and,
that
was
the
type
of
interrogation
that
went
on
with
these
witnesses
throughout
the
whole
hearing.
the
record
will
of
course,
display
that.
so
that,
the
other
point
that
we
want
to
raise
and
want
this
court
to
consider
is
the
fact
that
this
committee
was
at
this
time,
october
the
21st
of
1953,
acting
without
any
authority
or
any
of
legislative
purpose,
in
as
much
as
of
statute
that
they
had
recommended
or
had
already
been
passed
in
august
of
that
year
and
passed
over
the
veto
of
the
governor
of
ohio.
it
was
then
in
existence.
and
i
might
point
out
that
that
it's
interesting
that
the
statute
that
was
passed,
has
never
been
enforced
in
ohio,
because
the
attorney
general
at
that
time
said
that
it
was
unenforceable
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
nelson
case,
which
says
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
if
the
court
please,
i
think,
yesterday,
i
left
off
at
the
point
where
i
--
we
maintain
that
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
actually
had
no
authority
whatsoever
to
ever
call
any
witnesses
ahead
of
them,
before
them
and
question
them
in
the
area
of
subversive
activities.
i
think
the
thing
that
proves
our
point
is
the
fact
that
the
legislation
of
the
statutes
that
was
passed
because
of
their
recommendation,
ohio
rev.
code
2921.23
through
2921.27
was
held
immediately
after
it
was
passed
by
the
ohio
legislature
to
be
unenforceable
by
our
ohio
attorney
general,
and
the
ohio
commission
is
not
in
business
now.
it
went
out
of
business
on
january
1954.
so
that
all
the
furrow
and
fuss
that
they
caused
for
the
years
of
1951
to
1954
was
to
no
avail.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
the
ohio
attorney
general
has
held
that
these
statutes
were
unenforceable
and
no
--
there
was
--
under
these
particular
statutes,
there
were
special
attorney
generals
appointed
by
the
governor
and
immediately
after
the
attorney
general
found
that
this
was
unenforceable
because
of
the
nelson
case,
these
attorney
generals
resigned.
there
were
never
any
investigations
under
these
statutes,
and
the
work
was
not
carried
on
in
any
manner
whatsoever.
there
had
been,
of
course,
no
court
opinions
because
there
was
nothing
attempted
under
these
particular
statutes.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
they
decided
--
they
gave
no
opinion
whatsoever
in
the
ohio
supreme
court.
they
merely
said
that
the
particular
cases
before
this
court
now
involved
no
constitutional
questions
and
on
the
motion
of
the
prosecutor
from
stark
county,
they
--
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
they
did
dismiss
and
without
opinion.
that's
the
way
it
stands.
now
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
i
said
that,
as
a
result
of
the
ohio
commission,
the
work
and
the
investigations
and
the
furrow
they
--
they
caused
from
1951
to
1954
actually
accomplished
nothing
in
the
end
because
the
legislation
that
they
recommend
to
be
passed
by
ohio
legislature
and
was
passed
by
ohio
legislature
was
later
decided
by
the
ohio
attorney
general
that
was
unenforceable.
so,
i
say
that
all
of
the
fuss
that
they
caused,
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
actually
accomplished
nothing
in
--
by
way
of
legislation
which
was
supposed
to
have
been
the
purpose
that
they
were
set
up.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
well,
what
i
said
was
the
statute
that
was
passed
by
the
recommendation
of
the
ohio
un-american
activities
committee,
ohio
revised
sections
2921.21
through
2921.27
which
provided
for
special
attorney
generals
to
be
appointed
to
carry
on
the
investigation
into
subversive
activities
and
for
the
prosecution
of
anyone
who
was
found
to
be
active
in
this
activity.
as
a
result
of
the
attorney
general's
opinion,
these
assistant
attorney
generals
all
resigned
their
jobs,
and
these
particular
statutes
have
never
been
attempted
to
be
enforced
in
any
area
in
the
state
of
ohio.
and
this
--
these
statutes
were
passed
in
--
to
become
effective
in
october
--
november
the
1st,
1953,
and
to
date,
they
have
never
been
used.
and
there
are
no
attorney
generals
under
these
--
these
statutes
at
this
time,
no
special
investigators
which
were,
of
course,
had
been
appointed
by
the
governor
immediately
after
these
--
these
statutes
were
passed
and
one
of
the
appointments,
of
course,
was
the
attorney
for
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
who
had
been
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
well,
i
suppose
it
doesn't
actually
have
any
relevance
at
this
--
at
this
particular
time
in
--
in
the
light
of
the
uphaus
case,
except
that
i
think
that
it's
rather
significant
and
perhaps,
this
court
should
be
aware
of
what
has
happened
in
ohio.
and
everything
was
--
all
of
this
commotion
ended
in
nothing
so
far
as
--
as
establishing
legislative
statutes
that
could
be
enforced.
and
that
was
--
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
was
supposed
to
be
empowered
with
their
authority
for
the
purpose
of
recommending
certain
legislation
to
the
ohio
legislature.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that
is
correct.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
well,
the
ohio
attorney
general
issued
an
official
opinion
in
which
he
stated
that
these
statutes
were
unenforceable
in
light
of
the
nelson
case
that
was
passed
by
this
court,
was
ruled
upon
in
this
court.
in
the
nelson
case,
this
court
said
that
this
area
of
seditious
activity
was
completely
occupied
by
the
federal
government
and
could
not
be
--
states
could
not
become
active
in
this
field.
and
on
that
basis,
he
said
that
these
statutes
were
unenforceable
and
they
are
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
what
is
it?
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
this
particular
case
that
we
have
here?
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
this
case
is
--
comes
out
of
the
stark
county
of
ohio,
county
prosecutor,
mr.
putman,
who
is
here.
as
a
result
of
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
hearings
that
were
held
in
stark
county
while
they
still
--
while
the
commission
was
still
alive,
these
witnesses
who
--
these
appellants,
i
should
say,
who
declined
to
answer
various
questions
were
then
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
of
stark
county,
and
they
were
prosecuted
by
the
prosecutor
of
stark
--
stark
county
as
contempt
prosecutions
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
legislation
that
had
been
passed.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
no,
he
has
not,
merely
the
stark
county
prosecutor.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
no,
he
does
not,
in
--
in
ohio.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
he
does
not.
and
it's
usually
the
prosecutor
from
the
various
counties
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
--
that
--
where
the
case
starts,
follows
it
through.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
where
the
case
commences
in
a
certain
county.
now,
if
it
happens
to
be
a
state
case,
for
instance,
if
these
--
if
these
statutes
that
were
passed
were
being
enforced
by
the
attorney
general's
office,
if
this
was
set
up
so
that
he
could
go
into
various
counties
and
prosecute
people
by
after
investigating
them,
of
course,
his
office
would
be
the
one
who
would
go
all
the
way
through
with
the
appeal
because
he
would
be
the
one
who
would
be
instigating
the
actions
to
begin
with.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
the
--
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
county.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
at
that
time,
it
was
the
county
prosecutor
from
hamilton
county
and
county
prosecutor
from
franklin
county,
cincinnati
and
columbus.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
wanted
to
reach
this
morning
was
to
deal
with
the
argument
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
witnesses,
i
would
say
that
that
is
involved
by
implication,
not
by
an
actual
statement
by
the
chairman
that
the
privilege
was
available
but
merely
by
the
fact
that
when
the
attorney
for
the
commission
would
ask
various
witnesses
a
question
and
they
declined
to
answer,
they
would
then
move
on
to
the
next
question.
the
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
no,
they
had
not.
what
happened
was
that
the
commissioner's
--
the
commission's
attorney,
at
the
opening
of
the
hearing,
made
the
statement
to
the
first
witness.
he
said,
did
your
attorney
advise
you
of
the
fact
that
a
--
a
judge
in
franklin
county
has
ruled
on
the
immunity
statute?
and
the
witness
replied
by
saying
yes,
we
are
aware
of
that
decision
but
that
we
don't
feel
it's
binding
and
that
is
merely
one
judge's
opinion."
now,
these
hearings
in
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
i'll
read
exactly
what
that
--
this
judge
bryant
from
franklin
county
had
a
long
opinion
dealing
with
the
demurrer
that
had
been
filed
by
franklin
county
witnesses
who
had
been
found
guilty
of
contempt
prior
to
these
people
being
called
before
the
commission.
at
one
little
portion
of
the
opinion
stated
this.
further,
the
argument
of
possible
self-incrimination
are
answers
that
have
a
tendency
so
to
do
is
fully
met
by
the
provisions
of
section
101.44,
which
is
the
immunity
statute
which
this
court
has
a
copy
of
in
the
brief
before
them
now.
he
then
quotes
the
statute
in
full
and
says,
it
is
clearly,
therefore,
that
the
provision
of
section
101.44,
supra,
grant
immunity
to
the
witnesses
as
to
any
incriminating
matter
concerning
which
they
might
testify
had
they
entered
the
questions
propounded
to
them
by
the
said
commission.
there
may
be
one
exception
to
this
as
one
of
the
questions
appeared
to
deal
with
whether
or
not
false
testimony
had
been
given
at
a
previous
time
before
a
grand
jury
of
this
county.
it
can
be
safely
left
to
the
judge
who
tries
this
case
properly
to
apply
whatever
interpretation
be
required
to
make
fully
effective
the
protection
contemplated
by
the
provisions
of
section
10
article
i
of
the
ohio
constitution
should
it
develop
upon
consideration
of
the
evidence
that
the
immunity
provided
by
section
101.44
is
not
broad
enough
to
cover
a
particular
situation.
now,
this
is
the
only
judicial
reference
to
the
immunity
statute
that
was
made
relative
to
these
contempt
cases.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes,
i
think
that
the
raley
and
morgan
cases
had
precisely
the
same
issues
that
we're
going
--
that
we
have
in
this
case,
as
to
--
as
i
pointed
out,
as
to
two
of
the
witnesses
who
were
never
ordered
to
answer
and
which,
in
the
raley
case,
and
i'm
--
i'm
--
we
have
two
opinion
in
the
raley
case,
of
course,
the
unanimous
opinion
and
then
we
have
the
4-to-4
opinion,
and
i'm
reading
from
the
4-to-4
opinion
which
says
the
test
is
whether
the
witness
was
commanded
to
answer
regardless.
now,
i
--
as
i
read
the
opinions,
the
eight
--
eight
--
the
eighth
opinion
and
the
4-to-4
opinion
in
the
raley
case,
there
seem
to
be
agreement
by
this
court
that
the
least
a
witness
could
expect
is
a
direction
to
answer
before
they
could
be
found
guilty
of
contempt.
and
i
say
that,
as
at
least
to
two
of
these
appellants
before
this
court
now,
they
were
never
directed
to
answer,
and
they
were
never
granted
immunity.
and
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
the
two
that
were
never
granted
immunity
--
were
never
directed
to
answer?
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
were
laverne
slagle
and
paul
bohus.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
paul
bohus,
b-o-h-u-s.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
there
were
three
women
involved
and
all
three
of
the
women
had
been
directed
to
answer.
so,
of
course,
i
hope
to
go
into
various
points
that
would
mean
that
their
--
their
conviction
should
also
be
reversed.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
the
ones
who
were
--
that
were
not
mentioned
in
the
statute
--
the
immunity
statute
was
not
even
mentioned
to
them
was
laverne
slagle,
rose
mladajan,
and
eula
cooper.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes,
that
was
at
the
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that's
not
quite
the
facts.
in
the
morgan
case,
which
was
the
companion
case
of
raley,
the
chairman
did
tell
mrs.
morgan
that
she
could
use
the
privilege.
now,
in
the
other
three
cases,
that
was
brown,
raley
and
stern
which
were
from
cincinnati,
hamilton
county,
the
chairman
never
told
them
that
they
could
use
the
privilege
but
the
record
showed
that
their
conduct
was
such
by
never
directing
an
answer
and
by
implication,
this
court
found
that
the
--
the
committee
seem
to
take
it
for
granted
that
they
had
the
privilege
available.
now,
that's
what
the
record
in
the
morgan-raley
case
does
show.
mrs.
morgan
was
the
only
one
who
was
actually
told
that
she
had
the
privilege.
after
this
hearing
in
stark
county,
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
rule
on
the
immunity
statute
and
made
it
much
broader
than
ever
before.
and
they
said
in
their
opinion,
we
are
determining
for
the
first
time
in
regard
to
this
particular
statute
that
such
protection
is
sufficient
to
supplant
the
rule
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
now,
this
is
the
first
case
in
ohio
that
this
immunity
statute
had
ever
been
ruled
upon,
although
it
had
been
on
the
books
since
1872.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
this
was
--
this
was
after
these
people
appeared
before
the
commission.
these
people
appeared
in
canton
(ph)
before
the
commission
on
october
21st,
1953,
and
this
opinion
was
handed
down
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
february
23rd,
1956
in
164
ohio
st.
529.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
ohio
st.529.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that
was
the
morgan
case
decision,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i
think,
perhaps,
i
should,
at
this
time,
attempt
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
knapp-schweitzer
case,
which
the
prosecutor
uses
in
his
argument
as
being
supporting
his
position.
in
the
knapp
case,
knapp
was
subpoenaed
before
a
new
york
state
grand
jury
investigating
into
the
conventional
state
crimes
of
corruption
and
misconduct.
and
he
was
specifically
granted
immunity
from
state
prosecution
when
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
after
refusal,
the
court
adjudged
petitioner
in
contempt,
rejected
his
claim
of
fear
of
federal
prosecution
based
on
a
statement
of
the
united
states
attorney
that
he
would
cooperate
with
the
attorney
--
state's
attorney
in
this
field.
these
appellants
were
subpoenaed
to
be
--
to
appear
before
an
ohio
commission
investigating
in
the
area
of
subversion,
an
area
fully
occupied
by
congress
in
which
the
state
has
no
power
to
act.
this
is
also
an
area
involving
rights
guaranteed
by
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments,
the
essential
rights
referred
to
by
bill
of
rights
james
madison
as
quoted
in
knapp
at
page
377,
the
rights
of
conscience.
it
is
not
an
area
of
traditional
power
to
investigate
in
aid
of
prosecuting
conventional
state
crime.
some
facts
of
which
may
be
entangled
in
federal
offense.
in
the
knapp-schweitzer
case,
that
was
the
reverse
--
reverse
situation.
now,
this
court
has
said
before
that
it
is
--
it
is
not
unmindful
of
the
risk
of
compounding
punishments
which
would
be
created
by
finding
concurrent
state
power
over
seditious
activity,
"without
compelling
indication
to
the
contrary,
we
will
not
assume
that
congress
intended
to
permit
the
possibility
of
double
punishment,
that
is
the
quote
from
the
nelson
case
at
page
509
and
510.
now,
most
of
the
cases
that
we've
done
research
on
involving
immunity
statutes,
i
should
think
--
i
believe
all
of
them,
as
far
as
i
can
recall,
involved
grand
jury
investigations
into
crying
and
hearings
before
administry
--
administrative
agencies.
now,
this
is
a
fundamental
distinction
between
such
proceedings
and
hearings
before
a
legislative
investigating
committee.
a
grand
jury
exists
to
discover
the
commission
of
crimes.
it
functions
as
part
of
the
judicial
system
and
is
an
agency
in
administration
of
justice.
a
legislative
investigating
committee
has
no
authority
to
act
as
a
grand
jury
or
to
discover
the
commission
of
crimes.
its
only
authority
is
to
investigate
for
the
purpose
of
proposing
legislation.
the
theory
behind
all
immunity
acts
is
that
the
questioning
body
has
the
authority
to
compel
testimony
even
if
it
may
incriminate
the
witness
and
has
the
authority
to
grant
a
pardon
in
advance
or
otherwise,
protect
the
witness
from
subsequent
prosecution
as
to
matters
touched
in
this
compelled
testimony.
such
a
non-law
enforcement
agency
or
does
a
law
--
non-law
enforcement
agency
have
the
authority
to
grant
a
pardon
in
advance
or
otherwise
protect
the
witness
from
subsequent
prosecution
as
to
matters
testified
to
under
compulsion
unless
some
procedure
were
established
to
ensure
that
a
record
was
made
of
the
testimony
of
every
witness
before
a
state
legislative
committee
and
of
every
grant
of
immunity
to
a
witness,
denials
of
due
process
would
be
--
would
necessarily
occur.
i
think
that
is
what
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
knapp-schweitzer
case.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
i'm
reading
from
a
prior
brief
that
i
prepared
in
the
morgan
case
in
which
we
dealt
with
that
in
--
in
much
more
detail
than
i
did
in
--
in
this
case
before
the
court
now.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
oh,
yes.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that
was
in
the
nelson
case.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes,
the
nelson
case.
i
have
the
--
that
was
at
page
509
and
5010
in
the
nelson
case.
let's
see.
i
don't
have
the
complete
citation
of
it
before
me.
now,
i
feel
that
this
case,
the
appellants
here
have
tendered
exactly
the
same
issues
that
were
tendered
in
the
raley
and
ohio
case
which
this
court
did
not
rule
upon,
and
which
this
court
said,
at
page
425,
the
following,
"the
issues
tendered
by
the
parties
range
broadly
and
involved
the
power
of
the
ohio
legislature
in
view
of
existing
federal
legislation
to
investigate
activities
deemed
subversive
of
the
forms
of
government
within
the
nation,"

"the

in

and
also

versus

i
might
say
here
that
in
no
time
did
the
chairman
say
anything
to
these
witnesses,
these
appellants,
as
to
the
reason
for
their
investigation,
do
anything
to
explain
why
even
though
some
of
the
witnesses
raised
the
issue
as
to
why
that
particular
question
being
asked
at
the
time
was
pertinent
to
this
particular
investigation
is
being
--
that
was
going
on,
the
chairman
never
made
any
statement
to
explain.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
they,
at
various
times,
would
raise
an
issue
at
a
particular
question.
they
would
say
why
is
that
question
pertinent
to
this
issue?
in
that
type
of
language.
i
don't
think
that
any
witness
came
right
out
and
asked
for
a
complete
statement
from
the
chairman.
but
even
when
they
asked
whether
or
not
why
this
particular
question
was
pertinent,
the
chairman
would
usually
answer,
that's
beside
the
point.
answer
the
question,
and
so
forth.
i
mean,
they
would
never
give
them
an
answer
as
to
why
they
consider
it
pertinent
and
what
the
reason
for
their
investigation
was.
and
the
effect
--
this
is
also
from
your
statement
from
this
court,
and
the
effect
on
testimonial
compulsion
of
state
immunity
statutes
not
affording
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
that's
in
knapp
versus
schweitzer,
357
u.s.
371.
but
our
disposition
of
these
cases
makes
it
unnecessary
to
consider
the
application
of
the
principles
of
the
cases
just
cited.
now,
because,
at
that
time,
this
court
disposed
of
the
morgan
and
raley
cases
on
the
sole
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
witnesses
had
been
misled
to
believe
that
they
had
the
privilege
available
to
them,
so
that,
even
though
the
state
of
ohio
said
that
the
immunity
statute
fits
upon
anyone
who
walks
into
a
hearing
like
a
cloak
without
the
witness
being
notified
of
the
immunity
statute,
this
court
held
that
even
with
such
a
ruling
from
the
ohio
state
supreme
court
that
the
witnesses
should,
nevertheless,
had
been
directed
to
answer
and
should
not
have
been
entrapped
into
the
position
that
they
were
in
by
being
found
guilty
of
contempt.
and
since
those
cases
were
decided
on
that
issue
alone
and
left
the
other
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
morgan
and
raley
case
undecided,
and
these
are
precisely
the
same
issues
that
we
are
raising
in
this
case
before
the
courts
today,
the
same
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
raley
and
morgan
cases.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
in
my
last
brief
for
the
--
which
was
filed
with
this
court,
the
immunity
statute
is
on
page
9
and
goes
on
--
no,
it's
just
on
page
9.
it's
completely
on
page
9.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
on
page
9,
it
says
ohio
rev.
code,
section
101.44
provides.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
and
that
is
the
immunity
statute.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
i
say
this.
that,
as
to
two
of
the
witnesses,
the
morgan
and
raley
case
would
apply
to
them
and
they
should
have
been
released
because
they
were
never
directed
to
answer.
even
though
they
were
never
told
they
had
the
privilege,
the
conduct
of
the
commission
would
so
imply
that
they
had
the
privilege.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that's
correct.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that's
correct,
justice
brennan.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that
is
correct.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
you
do
not
have
it
in
this
case,
justice
brennan.
at
this
time,
that
is
all
the
argument
that
i
wish
to
present
on
the
behalf
of
the
appellants.
thank
you,
to
this
court,
very
much.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
i
just
want
to
try
to
clarify
essential
statements
that
i
think
mr.
putman
is
a
little
bit
confused
on.
he
was
not
present
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
the
commission.
i
was.
i
was
counsel
for
four
of
the
defendants.
the
kind
of
courtroom
that
the
hearing
was
held
in
was
like
any
common
pleas
or
court
of
appeals
court
where
the
judge
has
been
to
sit
upfront
and
the
tables
in
the
center
here
and
seats
in
the
back
of
the
room,
quite
a
large
courtroom.
the
witnesses
were
all
subpoenaed
for
the
same
day
but
whether
they
all
came
into
that
courtroom
at
the
same
time,
i
honestly
could
not
say,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
they
were
all
there
listening
to
each
other
testify.
witnesses
could
have
--
they
were
all
there
that
day,
and
they
became
present
and
were
sworn
in
when
they
were
called
by
the
commission
to
answer
questions.
but
whether
or
not
each
one
listened
to
what
the
other
one
was
being
asked
and
so
forth,
i
do
not
know
and
the
record
doesn't
know
because
i
was
upfront
with
my
witnesses
at
the
time
they
were
before
the
commission.
and
what
the
other
four
witnesses
were
doing
at
that
time,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing,
and
i'm
sure
mr.
putman
has
no
way
of
knowing.
now,
as
to
whether
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
campton,
ohio.
as
to
--
i
think
mr.
putman
is
also
a
little
bit
confused
about
what
this
commission
told
these
people
about
immunity.
they,
at
no
time,
offered
any
witness
immunity.
the
record
indicates
this
at
the
bottom
of
page
90,
which
mr.
putman
showed
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that
decision
was
made
subsequent
to
this,
justice
brennan.
this
--
this
hearing
took
place
in
october
of
1953.
the
ohio
supreme
court
made
that
pronouncement
in
february
of
1956.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor.
it
was
not
that
broad.
and
by
the
way,
for
the
court's
enlightenment,
i
don't
know
if
you
keep
records
or
not
but
in
the
morgan
record
that
was
before
the
court
in
the
october
term
of
1958,
that's
number
463
here
in
your
court,
this
judge
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
number
463,
this
judge
bryant's
opinion
is
in
the
record
in
full.
i
do
not
believe
that
--
that
judge
bryant's,
that's
that
common
pleas
judge
who
made
this
opinion
in
franklin
county,
i
do
not
believe
that
his
opinion
is
recorded
--
are
recorded
in
any
law
book.
but
you
will
find
it
in
this,
in
the
morgan
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
that
is
in
the
transcript
of
the
record
in
this
court,
in
the
united
states
supreme
court,
october
term
1958,
number
463.
that's
the
anna
morgan
versus
the
state
of
ohio.
now,
his
opinion
is
in
there
complete.
the
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
judge
bryant,
b-r-y-a-n-t,
and
his
decision
was
rendered
on
october
the
13th,
1953.
this
hearing
was
held
on
october
21st,
1953,
about
a
week
later.
on
page
90,
which
mr.
putman
already
called
to
your
attention,
is
the
first
reference
that
this
commission
made
to
the
immunity
statute
by
calling
the
witnesses'
attention
to
the
fact
that
judge
bryant
had
made
this
decision
in
franklin
county.
and
then
later,
with
witness
paul
bohus,
on
page
111
of
this
record
before
the
court
now,
the
attorney
for
the
commission
said
this,
after
paul
bohus
said,
i
invoke
the
fifth
amendment,
he
said,
the
attorney
said,
at
page
111
in
this
record
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
i'm
going
to
assume
that
your
counsel
has
fully
instructed
you
in
the
effects
of
this
decision
by
judge
bryant
of
the
franklin
county
common
pleas
court
and
has
also
instructed
you
about
your
rights
under
the
state
and
federal
constitutions.
is
that
--
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
the
answer
by
the
witness
was
counsel
had
instructed
me
on
that,
but
my
own
belief
is
that
it's
the
private
opinion
of
one
judge
and
my
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
had
guaranteed
me
the
position
i
have
taken
on
that
question.
the
counsel
goes
on
and
says
i
suggest
that
you
discuss
with
your
counsel
that
if
a
ruling
by
franklin
county
common
pleas
court
in
a
criminal
case
can
be
classed
as
a
private
opinion
of
one
judge,
you
may
find
it
has
a
more
far-reaching
effect.
the
witness
answers,
after
conferring
with
his
counsel,
it
is
not
a
matter
of
private
opinion,
but
it
is
just
one
man's
opinion.
now,
that
was
the
only
two
places
that
this
record
will
show
that
there
was
any
discussion
about
immunity,
and
that
was
only
with
paul
bohus
and
with
olga
perry,
and
i
submit
to
this
court
that
that
certainly
was
not
an
offer
of
immunity
to
either
one
of
these
people.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
page
92,
right
after
mrs.
perry,
on
--
at
page
90,
had
declined
to
answer
and
he
first
--
the
counsel
first
called
the
attention
of
this
decision
to
her,
on
page
92,
he
says
i
may
point,"
this
is
the
attorney
for
the
commission
himself
saying
this,
i
may
point
out
that
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
franklin
county
has
ruled
otherwise
but
as
you
sated
in
your
opinion,
that
is
just
one
man's
view.
he
was
agreeing
with
what
the
witness
had
said.
that's
in
page
92
of
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
witnesses
were
never
offered
immunity
or
ever
told
that
this
statute
of
immunity
applied
to
them.
it
was
merely
--
this
opinion
of
judge
bryant
was
referred
to
twice.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
yes.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
where
the
--
where
a
member
of
the
commission
asked
that
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
--
if
they
made
such
a
statement?
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
no,
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
where
they
made
such
a
flat
statement.
our
position
merely
is
that
when
the
attorney
for
the
commission
moved
on
from
one
question
to
the
other,
after
there
was
a
declamation
and
didn't
--
in
most
cases
didn't
direct
answer,
that
he
was
accepting
the
offer
--
the
declamation
and
the
reason
given
by
the
witness
at
that
time,
the
privilege.
that
is
all
the
--
just
to
--
i
want
to
clear
the
record
as
to
these
facts
that
were
discussed
by
mr.
putman.
i
think
there's
some
confusion
on
his
part,
and
i
have
no
further
argument
to
offer
at
this
time.
thank
you.
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
now,
--
so
that
we
are
clear,
you
want
a
statement
from
us
stipulated,
i
presume,
by
both
of
us
as
to
the
questions
asked
by
each
one
and
which
ones
were
directed
to
be
answered.
is
that
the
--
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
--
thing
you
in
the
presentation?
mr.
thelma
c.
furry
thank
you,
your
honor.
