versus
ohio,
mrs.

chief
justice
earl
warren
were
either
or
both
of
these
petitioners,
one
of
the
two
that
--
to
whom
the
statement
was
made?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
both
--
all
five
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
them
before
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mrs.
furry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
furry,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
--
oh,
pardon
me.
that's
what
i'm
asking,
isn't
that
a
matter
of
state
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
point
raised
in
the
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
this
particular
point
that
you're
in
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
decide
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
attorney
general
normally
appear
in
cases
of
this
kind
in
--
in
courts
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
ohio,
he
does
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
follows
it
through.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
assume
that
the
--
that
this
was
a
case
of
murder,
a
robbery
or
arson
or
something
of
that
kind,
would
it
--
would
it
be
pursued
up
to
this
court
by
the
district
--
district
attorney
or
your
prosecuting
attorney
rather?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
not
by
the
attorney
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
that
second
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
were
there
any
of
these
that
were
not
told
of
this
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
ones?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
before
or
after
--after
these
people
appeared
before
the
committee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
the
witnesses
did
ask
what
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
the
immunity
statute
in
the
record
or
briefs
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
one
filed
january
11?
is
that
the
brief
filed
january
11?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
--
well,
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time.
mr.
putman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
putman,
while
we're
getting
this
background,
may
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
interrupt
you
before
you
get
into
the
other.
now,
you
say
that
this
was
--
was
a
commission
as
distinguished
from
a
legislative
committee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
all
i
want
--
all
i
want
to
ask
you
is
whether
that
holding
of
the
supreme
court
was
before
or
after
the
hearing
that
these
people
had
for
which
they
are
now
held
in
contempt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
hearing
was
after
the
supreme
court
had
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now,
this
--
this
language,
if
--
this
language
is
rather
explicit,
and
i'm
wondering
if,
in
the
absence
of
--
of
such
a
holding,
if
they
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
rely
on
this
language
because
it
says
"except
a
person
who,
in
writing,
request
permission
to
appear
before
a
committee
or
subcommittee
of
the
general
assembly
or
be
their
house
thereof
or
who,
in
writing,
waives
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
granted
by
this
section,
the
testimony
of
a
witness
examined
before
a
committee
or
subcommittee
shall
not
be
used
as
evidence
in
the
criminal
proceeding
against
such
witness."
now,
it
says
nothing
about
the
commissions
in
there
and
would
not
a
private
citizen,
in
the
absence
of
a
--
of
a
rule
by
the
supreme
court,
be
entitled
to
--
to
say
that
this
meant
what
it
said,
a
--
a
committee
or
subcommittee
of
the
legislature?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
after
--
after
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
thought
mrs.
furry
told
us
it
was
not
the
fact,
that
there
were
two
of
them
--
two
of
them,
they
asked
that
slagle,
mladajan
and
cooper,
is
that
right,
were
not
present?
is
that
what
the
counsel
stated
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
record
doesn't
show.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
putman,
may
be
you
gave
us
the
page
but
if
you
did,
i
--
it
escaped
me,
the
--
the
page
where
the
judge
had
been
--
page
of
the
transcript
where
the
judge
had
them
in
his
chambers
before
the
hearing
and
told
them
about
the
waiver
of
immunity
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
90?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let's
see
what
--
what
that
language
is.
i'm
asking
your
husband's
name
and
you
have
given
the
answer
which
indicates
there
is
something
about
mentioning
your
husband's
name
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
or
degrade
you.
of
course,
you
--
you
know
best
what
the
relationship
with
your
husband
is.
if
you
choose
to
refuse
to
answer
on
the
basis
that
such
an
answer
would
make
you
subject
to
federal
state
prosecution,
i
will
only
point
out
to
you
that,
possibly,
your
counsel
has
already
called
to
your
attention
a
decision
recently
handed
down
by
the
common
pleas
court
of
franklin
county
which
states
that
a
witness
may
not
avail
himself
of
the
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution
in
a
hearing
before
a
state
commission,
before
which
the
state
of
ohio
is
granted
immunity
for
prosecution
for
any
offense
except
perjury.
has
your
counsel
called
that
to
your
attention?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
say
that
--
that
is
the
place?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
also
to
say
that
the
commission
had
resolved
that
--
that
they
could
not
be
prosecuted
and
--
and
that
no
prosecutions
would
result
if
they
did
testify.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
misunderstood
what
you
said
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
judge
--
did
the
judge
give
concurrent
sentences
on
each
one
of
the
counts
or
did
he
just
say
six
months
for
--
for
your
offenses?
didn't
he
just
give
an
aggregate
sentence
as
distinguished
from
saying
i
give
you
six
months
in
the
first
count,
six
in
the
second,
and
so
forth
and
saying
they'll
be
served
concurrently?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
does
the
journal
show
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
putman,
you've
been
very
frank
with
us,
and
i
--
i
do
want
to
get
this
--
this
straight
in
my
--
my
mind
though.
now,
at
the
--
at
the
time
these
people
testified
before
the
committee
or
rather
refused
to
testify
before
the
commission,
there
was
no
ruling
of
your
supreme
court
to
the
effect
that
this
immunity
statute
embrace
commissions,
as
well
as
committees
and
subcommittees
of
the
legislature.
and
all
these
people
had
before
them,
so
far
as
the
basic
law
of
your
state
was
concerned
and
the
rulings
of
your
supreme
court,
the
language
of
the
section
which
limited
it
specifically
to
committees
and
subcommittees
of
the
--
of
the
legislature.
now,
is
it
not
the
--
is
it
not
a
real
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
those
people
had
a
right
to
rely
upon
a
plain
language
of
the
--
of
the
statute
in
refusing
to
--
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
their
testimony
might
incriminate
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
talking
out
--
about
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute.
now,
if
it
was
--
if
it
was
other
than
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute,
it
might
be
a
different
situation.
but
--
but
this
statute
reads
any
--
any
witness
who
is
called
before
a
committee
or
a
subcommittee
of
the
legislature
is
given
immunity,
and
you
have
told
us
that
this
body
that
they
refused
to
testify
before
was
consciously
made
a
commission
and
not
a
committee
or
subcommittee
of
the
legislation
--
legislature
for
a
specific
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
alright.
well,
now,
if
--
if
that
is
true,
is
there
any
reason
on
earth
why
they
aren't
entitled
to
rely
on
a
plain
and
obvious
reading
of
that
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
by
a
court
of
common
plea,
your
common
pleas
court.
then
--
then
where
does
that
--
where
does
the
court
of
common
pleas
stand
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
a
bind
--
it
isn't
a
decision
that's
binding
all
over
the
state,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
--
i
presume
that
if,
subsequent
to
this
hearing,
the
supreme
court
had
held
otherwise
that
the
language
of
the
section
when
it
said
a
committee
or
a
subcommittee
meant
a
subcommittee
or
a
committee
and
nothing
else,
that
they
could
not
then
be
punished
for
contempt,
could
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
that's
what
i
meant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
those
reported
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
they
published
cases
in
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
may
i
ask
this,
could
you
--
could
you
and
counsel
agree
upon
whatever
you
send
to
us
in
that
regard,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
--
would
you
do
that
jointly
then
for
us?
we'd
appreciate
it
very
much,
mr.
putman
and
mrs.
furry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
you've
been
very
frank
with
us,
mr.
putnam.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
appreciate
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
furry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
is
that
again,
please?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
court
--
the
court
will
appreciate
very
much
the
cooperation
of
counsel
on
both
--
both
sides
in
untangling
this
kind
of
--
of
facts
for
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
any
other
--
any
other
comparative
facts
here
that
will
--
will
show
us
the
status
of
the
--
of
the
individual
defendants
before
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
it
need
not.
it
need
not
be,
if
you
will
just
--
if
you
will
just
have
it
typewritten
and
sent
to
us,
that
will
be
sufficient.
so
we
don't
ask
you
to
write
any
additional
briefs.
if
you
will
just
--
if
you
will
just
make
the
facts
known
to
us
in
a
rather
graphic
form,
we
appreciate
it
very
much.
