mr.
norman
j.
putman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
so
that
there
is
no
confusion
arising
from
these
matters
of
state
law,
although
i
grant
they
are
not
relevant
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
i
would
like
to
state
that,
first
of
all,
i
did
not
prosecute
these
cases.
i
was
not
prosecuting
attorney
for
stark
county
in
1953.
i
took
office
in
1957.
in
the
state
of
ohio,
criminal
prosecutions
are
handled
on
the
county
level
by
each
of
the
88
county
prosecutors.
the
attorney
general
is
not
a
criminal
prosecuting
attorney.
he's
the
lawyer
for
the
governor
of
the
state
and
the
various
state
agencies.
when
there
is
a
crime
on
state
property
or
when
there
has
been
a
fraud
against
the
state
or
when
there
is
some
reason
for
a
special
investigation,
the
attorney
general
may
be
directed
by
the
governor
to
prosecute
the
cases.
so,
it
is
very
unusual
to
see
an
attorney
general
in
any
case
at
any
level
in
our
state
criminal
matters.
the
second
thing
that
needs
to
be
pointed
out
in
this
particular
case
is
that
there
were
some
serious
state
law
questions
which
arose
at
the
time
the
un-american
activities
commission
of
the
ohio
general
assembly
was
created.
those
questions
have
been
resolved
in
164
ohio
state
by
the
ohio
supreme
court,
and
i
don't
discuss
them
to
argue
them,
but
they
explain
how
these
cases
came
up
the
way
they
are,
why
we're
still
here
and
why
the
ohio
courts
feel
bound
to
send
these
cases
up
here
to
the
united
states
supreme
court.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
considerable
problem
in
the
state
law
level
about
the
power
of
the
ohio
general
assembly
to
create
a
commission
which
existed
beyond
its
sine
die
adjournment.
that
question
has
been
resolved
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
commission.
but
for
that
reason,
they
did
not
appoint
a
committee,
such
as
the
congress
has,
for
the
investigating
of
un-american
activities.
this
is
not
a
united
states
congress
type
of
committee.
this
is
a
commission
created
and
given
birth
to
by
the
legislature
so
that
it
may
operate
under
ohio
law
after
the
adjournment
of
the
legislature.
now,
they
called
it
a
commission
and
you
will
observe,
when
you
read
the
ohio
immunity
statute,
it
says
any
person
who
testifies
before
a
committee.
at
the
time,
there
were
a
lot
of
very
good
criminal
lawyers
who
had
serious
doubts
that
the
immunity
statute
which
was
specifically
in
terms
criminal
statutes
being
strictly
construed
against
the
state,
since
the
defendant
can
commit
no
error
in
ohio.
they
felt
there
was
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
this
immunity
statute
was
available.
for
that
reason,
apparently,
the
un-american
activities
commission,
when
it
met
for
the
morgan,
raley
and
stern
cases,
elected
to
play
it
safe
and
told
its
witnesses,
you
may
seek
refuge
behind
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination."
apparently,
to
me,
they
felt
there
was
no
sense
in
telling
these
people
they
had
an
immunity
at
all.
so
they
--
they
told
them
that
they
could
rely
on
the
fifth
amendment.
apparently,
what
happened
was
that,
thereafter,
the
un-american
activities
commission,
having
questioned
witnesses
and
moved
off
from
the
scene,
some
eager
beaver
grand
jury
at
the
county
level,
decided
that
this
had
been
terrible
that
these
witnesses
had
refused
to
answer,
and
they
indicted
them
under
the
ohio
criminal
code.
these
are
not
indictments
in
the
instant
case
under
the
ohio
criminal
code.
the
raley,
morgan
and
stern
cases
were
indictments
under
the
ohio
criminal
code.
in
ohio,
there
are
no
common
law
crimes.
all
crimes
are
codified.
so,
there
was
an
indictment
under
the
ohio
criminal
code
returned
for
the
crime
of
failing
to
testify
before
a
committee
of
the
state
legislature,
a
specific
crime.
when
that
case
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
there
was
a
4-to-3
split
in
the
first
place.
judge
stewart
recognized
right
off
the
bat
that
under
ohio
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
morgan,
raley
and
brown
and
even
stern
were
not
guilty
as
a
matter
of
fact
of
the
crime
of
contempt.
this
business
of
entrapment
is
aside
from
the
mark,
as
a
criminal
lawyer
understands
entrapment.
that
is
the
inducement
to
do
a
substantive
wrong.
as
i
understand
judge
stewart's
ruling,
it
was,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
guilt
at
all
because
they
were
not
in
contempt.
they
were
told,
you
may
take
the
fifth
amendment.
the
witnesses
say
thanks,
we'll
take
it.
there's
no
guilt.
that
was
what
was
wrong
with
the
raley,
morgan
and
brown
cases.
now,
with
respect
to
the
stern
case,
stern
was
convicted
and
by
a
4-to-4
split
of
this
court,
one
member
not
sitting,
it
developed
that
stern's
conviction
was
affirmed
for
the
reason
that
there
was
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
four
members
of
the
court
that
stern,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
abstinent.
his
mental
attitude
was
that
of
hostility
toward
the
committee.
he
had
been
overruled.
he
made
his
objection.
he
pled
the
fifth
amendment
and
they
said,
it
does
not
apply
in
our
opinion
because
this
question
could
not
possibly
incriminate
you.
therefore,
you
are
directed
to
answer.
and
stern
--
stern's
conviction
is
affirmed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
land,
and
that
carries
with
it
the
authority
of
a
holding,
the
authority
that
the
ohio
un-american
activities
commission
was
valid,
that
they
validly
met
under
state
law,
that
the
questions
were
pertinent,
that
the
holding
may
be
overruled.
i
understand
that,
but
that's
our
authority
directly
in
this
case.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
4-to-4.
i'm
reciting,
as
an
officer
of
the
court,
the
authority.
now,
what
happened
then
in
stark
county?
in
stark
county,
in
the
cases
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
wish
to
discuss
that
also.
i'm
trying
to
straighten
out
what
appears
to
be
a
lot
of
nonsense
from
ohio
which,
if
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
an
ohio
lawyer,
is
the
only
way
it
could
happen.
so,
in
stark
county,
after
the
un-american
activities
commission
met,
and
i
might
say,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
they
were
validly
met.
and
the
record
will
show
on
page
45
that
it
is
just
not
true
that
the
chairman
of
the
committee
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
they
were
there
only
to
expose.
the
question
was
asked
on
page
45,
and
it
was
a
tricky
question,
so
that,
when
you
stated
a
moment
ago
that
the
purpose
--
that
couldn't
be
the
purpose
because
the
law
had
already
passed,
and
above
that,
that
as
far
as
passing
legislation,
that
was
not
the
purpose
of
the
committee,
was
it?
samuel
levine,
who
was
later
elected
prosecutor
and
is
now
serving
in
the
congress,
answered
correctly,
to
pass
legislation?
question
he
asked.
no,
that
wasn't
the
purpose
of
the
committee,
and
he
goes
on
to
explain,
the
purpose
of
the
committee
was
to
gather
evidence
and
recommend
legislation.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
rather
a
farfetched
attempt
to
prove
that
the
committee
was
admitting
that
it
wasn't
there
to
investigate
legitimately.
he
simply
tried
to
give
a
truthful
answer
under
oath
that
this
committee
isn't
going
to
pass
any
legislation.
alright,
what
happened
then
in
stark
county?
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
but
it
was
later
held
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
to
be
a
select
committee.
so
they
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
held
that
the
immunity
statute
did
apply
and
that
they
were
authorized
on
this.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
sir,
that
hearing
was
later.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
no,
no,
no,
your
honor.
at
the
time
the
witnesses
were
asked
to
appear
and
testify
and
required
to
take
their
chances,
they
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
the
rule
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
hey
were
on
the
spot.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
well,
not
only
would
a
private
citizen
would
be
inclined
to
feel
that
way
but
judge
kingsley
taft
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
felt
that
way
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
164
ohio
st.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
simply
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
is,
so
far
as
the
applicability,
and
i
understand
not
so
far
as
due
process
is
concerned
but
so
far
as
the
state
law
is
concerned,
that
has
been
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state
4-to-3.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
and
not
only
that,
they
--
they
still
didn't
convince
one
of
the
judges
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
that
it
applied.
he
dissented.
i'm
simply
throwing
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
that
in,
in
support
of
your
question.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
the
state
law
is
clear,
however,
and
was
understood,
and
was
understood
generally,
by
lawyers
that
immunity
in
ohio
community
statutes,
which
read
in
that
language,
are
like
a
cloak
that
come
over
you
when
you
sit
down
in
the
chair
or
when
you
stand
up
and
take
the
oath,
that
it
requires
a
specific
written
waiver
to
divest
yourself
of
the
immunity.
it's
a
dangerous
thing
for
a
prosecutor
to
use
because
he
has
to
be
careful
who
he
calls
in
and
bathes
in
immunity.
however,
that's
the
law
of
ohio
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
question
in
the
mind
of
these
people
as
they
testified
before
the
un-american
activities
commission
as
to
whether
they
had
immunity
by
reason
of
the
sequence
of
the
ruling.
however,
in
this
particular
hearing,
to
get
right
now
to
the
raley
and
stern
business,
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation
here.
the
facts
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
they're
short.
this
hearing
was
held
in
the
stark
county
courthouse
and
all
five
of
these
defendants
were
called
into
judge
graham's
courtroom
together.
where,
was
assembled
a
number
of
people
who
wanted
to
witness
this
procedure.
all
five
witnesses
were
there,
and
they
were
represented
by
quite
competent
counsel.
everyone
was
present
at
the
time
that
everyone
else
testified.
mrs.
furry
represented
all
but
one
of
the
witnesses
and
mr.
scribner,
who
was
before
the
bar
of
this
particular
court
in
the
barenblatt
case,
represented
mr.
slagle.
mr.
pollak,
one
of
--
one
of
the
witnesses
associated
with
mr.
scribner
--
one
of
the
lawyers
associated
with
the
mr.
scribner
represented
the
other
witness.
they
were
all
informed
at
the
beginning
of
this
hearing,
and
the
record
before
the
court
shows
it,
that
it
was
the
ruling
of
this
commission
that
the
immunity
statute
applied
because
the
court
in
franklin
county
had
said
so
that
the
witnesses
were
to
understand
they
were
given
immunity
automatically
by
a
hearing,
that
they
could
not
incriminate
themselves
under
state
law.
they
were
given
immunity.
and
that
the
fifth
amendment,
as
a
privilege,
would
not
be
recognized,
and
they
were
expected
to
answer.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
the
first
witness,
mrs.
perry
--
well,
state's
exhibit
k
begins
at
page
87.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
at
page
87
of
the
record
begins
the
transcript.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
page
90
--
page
90
of
the
record
here.
they
asked
mrs.
perry
what's
her
husband's
name.
mrs.
perry
says
i'm
asking
you
why
my
husband's
name
is
pertinent.
the
questioner
says
for
the
purpose
of
identification.
you
have
indicated
that
you
are
married,
etcetera,
and
that's
why
we
want
to
know
what
your
husband's
name
is.
if
you
choose
to
answer
on
the
basis
that
such
an
answer
will
make
you
subject
to
federal
or
state
prosecution,
i
only
point
out
to
you
that,
possibly,
your
counsel
has
already
called
your
attention."
a
decision
handed
down
recently
by
the
common
pleas
court
of
franklin
county
which
states
that
a
witness
may
not
avail
himself
of
the
amendments
of
the
federal
constitution
in
a
hearing
before
a
state
commission,
before
which
the
state
of
ohio
to
grant
immunity
for
prosecution
for
any
offense
except
perjury.
"has
your
counsel
already
called
that
to
your
attention?"
answer,
my
counsel
has
informed
me
on
this,
but
that's
only
the
opinion
of
one
judge.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
all
were
present,
mr.
justice
harlan.
at
the
time
the
statement
was
made,
all
heard
the
questions
and
the
directions
to
the
other.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
the
record
does
not
affirmatively
indicate
in
that
language
that
that
is
the
fact.
however,
the
--
the
record
indicates,
by
the
sequence,
that
one
follows
the
other,
and
it
may
well
be
that
there
is
a
failure
of
this
particular
record
to
affirmatively
indicate,
such
as
the
record
does
when
they
say
a
quorum
--
let
the
record
show
a
quorum
is
all
present.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
that
the
record
affirmatively
indicates
that
all
five
defendants
were
present,
except
that
i
believe
that
counsel
will
recognize
that
it
was
a
fact
on
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
didn't
understand
her
to
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
but
i
want
it
to
be
clear
that
i
don't
know
--
because
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
i
was
not
there,
and
i'm
not
representing
anything
to
the
court.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
and
the
record
does
not
affirmatively
indicate
that.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
well,
let
me
concede,
sir,
that
they
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
there's
no
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
find
nothing
unreasonable
about
that
feeling.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i'm
in
sympathy
with
the
person,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
absolutely.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
--
that
is
one
of
the
substantial
questions
involved
in
this
case.
what
i'm
trying
to
do
here
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
mr.
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
demonstrate
here.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
well
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
--
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that
is
correct.
and
there
is
a
substantial
question
involved
in
that
which
i
would
like
to
get
to,
it
being,
that
even
if
it
were
true,
it
was
not
a
grant
of
immunity
from
federal
prosecution.
and
these
questions
were
directed
specifically
about
communist
activities.
this
was
an
--
this
was
a
barenblatt
type
of
question
being
propounded
to
the
witness
directly
about
communist
activities,
your
communist
activity
at
ohio
state
university,
your
membership
in
the
communist
party,
your
working
for
communist
party
members
who
are
candidates
for
office.
it
was
a
direct
inquiry
into
communist
affiliation.
an
answer
to
which
would
have
incriminated
them
under
federal
law
under
the
knapp
versus
schweitzer
and
raley.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
as
a
normal
person
might
have
reasonably
read
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
if
--
if
a
failure
to
understand
the
law
correctly
is
held
to
be
a
defense,
that
is
true.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
however
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
no,
your
honor.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
develop.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
if
the
court
please,
the
point
involved
in
--
in
this
case
and
which
was
discussed
in
the
note
at
page
444
of
360
u.s.
in
the
raley
cases
was
that,
under
the
ohio
law,
as
announced
in
the
opinion
below,
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
a
willful
or
deliberate
refusal.
these
cases
are
brought
under
the
civil
contempt
of
court
statute
which
simply
says
a
failure
to
answer
the
question
results
in
the
infraction
of
the
rule.
this
was
not
in
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
they
can
be
put
in
--
they
can
be
incarcerated.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
see
no
difference
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
sir.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
given
them
immunity.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that
is
--
that
is
what
was
involved
in
the
mind
of
the
person
answering
the
question.
and
there's
no
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
except
that,
as
a
matter
of
law
in
ohio,
the
ohio
supreme
court
held
that
as
a
matter
of
ohio
law,
you
are
charged
with
the
knowledge
of
the
law
as
of
right
now,
no
matter
what
the
court
in
the
future
says
it's
going
to
be.
and
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
federal
due
process
question
involved
in
that.
i'm
simply
trying
to
get
the
fact
picture
straight
as
to
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
as
to
how
it
came
up.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
now,
then
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
our
understanding
is
that
that
took
place
--
that
conference
took
place
not
at
the
criminal
trial,
but
at
the
hearing
before
the
commission,
on
page
90,
where
there
was
a
discussion
of
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
a
discussion
of
the
--
of
the
ruling
of
the
common
pleas
court.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
let
me
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
let
me
correct
my
mistake.
when
i
said
to
the
court
that
all
of
the
witnesses
were
in
judge
graham's
courtroom,
i
meant
the
large
courtroom
in
which
the
trial
took
place
for
the
purpose
of
the
conduct
of
the
question
and
answer
period.
i
did
not
intend
to
convey
any
impression
that
everyone
was
huddled
into
court's
private
chambers
in
a
conference
ensued
between
the
defendant
and
their
counsel.
it
has
been
our
information
from
a
reading
of
this
record
that
the
different
witnesses
were
present
while
each
other
were
being
questioned
during
the
hearing,
the
formal
open
hearing
under
oath,
and
that
they
had
an
opportunity
to
learn,
having
been
represented
by
common
counsel
that
the
witnesses
were
being
informed
that
the
immunity
statute
applied
by
the
common
pleas
court's
ruling
and
that
the
commission
wanted
answers.
that's
the
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
only
statement
that
i
am
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
have
found
no
such
resolution
in
the
record
of
this
case
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
well,
it's
probably
my
fault.
i'm
--
i'm
simply
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
commission
made
no
resolution
that
i
know
of
in
this
particular
hearing
throughout
the
record
as
such.
there
are
notations
where
there
have
been
specific
directions
to
answer.
let
the
record
show
a
quorum
is
present.
and
i
have
those
noted.
the
--
the
witnesses
cooper
--
the
witness
cooper
was
ordered
to
answer
a
question
at
record
page
134,
at
record
page
135
and
at
record
page
130.
olga
perry
was
ordered
to
answer
a
question
at
record
page
91.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
yes,
sir?
mr.
norman
j.
putman
the
issues
that
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
the
issues
in
this
case
are,
first
of
all,
whether
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
afforded
by
the
federal
constitution
is
a
privilege
and
immunity
of
federal
citizenship,
whether
it
is
part
of
due
process
as
--
as
binding
on
state
courts
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
whether,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
knapp
versus
schweitzer,
which
authorizes
that
sort
of
whiplashing,
ought
to
be
overruled.
that's
a
substantial
issue
in
the
opinion
of
a
prosecuting
attorney
about
a
rule
of
law
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
very
little,
if
no,
help
at
all
in
obtaining
of
evidence
for
the
prosecution
of
crime
because
unwilling
witnesses
are
no
help
to
you.
that's
substantially
involved
in
this
case
because
three
of
these
witnesses
were
directly
ordered
to
answer
questions.
they
were
told
they
had
immunity,
and
they
said,
we
don't
want
any
of
that
state
immunity
business
because
you're
asking
us
about
questions
for
which
we
could
go
to
the
federal
pen
under
the
smith
act,
and
i
think
that's
a
substantial
federal
question
that
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
raise
and
have
preserved
in
the
record
and
have
borne
their
burden
of
proof
on
appeal
which
they
did
not
do
in
the
raley
case.
the
second
issue
that
i
believe
is
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
ohio
commission
is
allowed
to
ask
these
questions
of
this
type.
i
think
that
is
settled
by
the
uphaus
case,
which
was
reported
in
the
same
volume
as
the
raley
case
and
the
barenblatt
case.
thirdly,
there
is
involved
because
the
first
witness,
mrs.
perry,
took
the
first
amendment,
as
well
as
the
fourth,
fifth,
sixth,
ninth
and
fourteenth
amendment,
whether
there
is
involved
some
question
about
her
rights
of
freedom
to
assemble,
free
speech,
free
religion,
to
petition
the
assembly,
all
of
these
questions
that
were
discussed
yesterday
afternoon.
i
think
that's
involved
in
mrs.
perry's
case
as
to
whether
or
not
this
fact
situation
is
a
barenblatt
type
of
situation
where
the
questions
are
directly
about
communist
affiliation
or
whether
it's
a
sweezy
question
where
they
ask
you
about
a
speech
or
a
lecture
at
a
university
and
your
membership
and
the
progress
report.
that's
in
this
case,
in
mrs.
perry's
convictions.
also
in
this
case
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
have
expressed
a
legislative
interest
for
an
inquiry
and
whether
they
have
articulated
it
to
the
person
summoned
in
every
single
question
for
which
there
is
a
conviction.
the
thing
that
makes
this
complicated
is
that
there
are
five
defendants,
there
were
10
counts
in
each
indictment
and,
although
the
judge
found
the
defendants
not
guilty
on
some
counts,
there
are
a
number
of
different
counts
in
a
number
of
different
questions.
and
you
can
have
quite
a
field
day
in
the
court
of
pleas.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
don't
see
how
the
court
can
avoid
it,
and
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
they
were
all
concurrent,
and
they
were
all
properly
pronounced.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
they
were
all
concurrent.
there
were
five
to
10
days
in
the
county
jail
and
a
fine
of
$500.
it
was
the
maximum
sentence
allowable
under
the
state
law.
there
is
also
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
what
the
court
has
in
the
record
is
neither
the
verbal
pronouncement
of
sentence
which
you
had
yesterday
nor
the
written
journal
entry
of
the
sentence
which
was
discussed
yesterday
in
court
but
a
written
opinion
of
the
court
declaring
his
--
his
present
state
of
mind
that
the
defendants
are
guilty
and
that
in
the
future,
he
will
call
them
in
and
sentence
them.
the
record
before
this
court
does
not
reveal
whether
the
sentences
were
concurrent
or
consecutive,
unless
some
counselor
has
made
some
statement
to
that
effect
in
his
brief.
but
the
record
does
not
show
either
the
verbal
pronouncement
to
the
defendant
from
the
bench
of
his
sentence,
nor
the
journal
entry.
and
in
ohio,
courts
of
record
speak
only
through
their
journal.
they
do
not
speak
from
the
bench.
and
if
it
is
not
on
the
journal
by
journal
entry,
it
does
not
exist.
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
sentence
verbally.
if
it
does
not
appear
as
part
of
the
owner's
journal
under
state
law,
the
defendant
is
not
sentenced.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
don't
know
what
the
journal
shows,
except
i'm
satisfied
that
it
shows
concurrent
sentences,
that
there
was
no
attempt
to
attack
these
on
one
after
another.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
--
i
do
not
believe
that
there's
any
way
out
of
it.
and
i
believe
the
questions
are
substantial
federal
questions
that
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
--
to
have
answer.
and
they're
different
questions.
they
invoke
each
of
these
cases
on
page
425
of
360
u.s.,
for
the
court
enumerates
the
questions
in
the
morgan
and
raley
case
that
were
not
necessary
to
decide
because
the
burden
of
proof
about
raising
it
in
the
lower
court
had
been
met.
i'm
simply
conceding
here
that
it
certainly
has
been
met
and
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
has
ruled
on
it.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
feel
bound,
as
an
officer
of
this
court,
to
submit
that
the
convictions
are
valid
under
the
present
state
of
the
pronouncements
of
this
tribunal
under
the
direct
authority
of
the
stern
case.
if
stern
can
go
to
jail
in
ohio,
as
a
result
of
one
of
these
un-american
activities
commissions,
i
submit
that
that
is
authority
for
us
to
urge
the
affirmance.
what
i
ask,
as
a
prosecuting
attorney
of
the
court
due,
is
decide
the
issues
with
respect
to
this
immunity
from
federal
prosecution
versus
state
prosecution
because
it
troubles
us
and
gives
us
difficulty
repeatedly
in
our
proceedings.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
--
your
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
not
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i'm
not
embarrassed.
it
should
extend,
yes,
to
both
federal
and
state
prosecution
or
there
ought
to
be
no
ability
on
the
part
of
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
compel
testimony.
getting
to
the
attorney
general's
place
in
ohio,
i
might
point
out
our
experience.
the
attorney
general
came
into
ohio
last
summer
and
put
a
negro
in
jail
and
said,
you
put
the
finger
on
somebody
for
bribery
or
sit
there
until
you
put
the
finger
on
him.
he
says
i'm
not
going
to
because
i
might
incriminate
myself.
the
judge
said,
you
can't
take
the
fifth
amendment
because
we
have
a
state
immunity
statute.
he
said,
well,
i've
got
a
federal
income
tax
to
worry
about.
and
he
said,
you
sit
in
jail.
well,
he
sat
in
jail
overnight
and
finally,
he
put
the
finger
on
a
police
sergeant
for
$10
for
three
years
ago,
sometime
in
october.
the
attorney
general
took
the
case
to
the
trial
court
and
the
jury
acquitted
the
defendant
in
10
minutes
on
the
first
ballot.
that's
the
kind
of
testimony
you
get
from
compelled
witnesses.
immunity
statutes
are
terrific
for
prosecutors
to
clothe
willing
accomplice
witnesses.
but
the
value
of
the
knapp
versus
schweitzer
rule
so
outweighs
horrible
prays
of
federalism
that
we
pay
for
it
in
embarrassment.
everyone
looks
at
perry
and
mason,
and
they
say
you
prosecutors
are
all
alike.
you
do
terrible
things
to
defendants.
and
i
do
not
ask
you.
since
you
have
asked
me,
what
i
will
say,
frankly,
is
of
no
value
to
us.
i
am
much
more
concerned
as
a
prosecuting
attorney
about
exclusionary
rules
and
things
of
that
type
that
are
not
in
this
case
where
we
have
reliable
evidence
which
would
be
helpful
as
a
matter
of
truth.
those
are
the
things
that
--
that
we
get
concerned
about,
and
so
i
don't
urge
to
plead
on
the
basis
of
hamstringing
the
police
to
preserve
knapp
versus
schweitzer,
and
i'm
glad
i
got
the
chance
to
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
say
that
without
abandoning
my
obligation.
i
would
like
to
see
that
issue
decided
in
this
case
rather
than
on
some
narrow
ground,
since
the
court
has
inquired
of
me.
and
i
believe
that
those
issues
are
fairly
raised
by
the
defendant
in
this
case,
and
i
think
they've
been
rather
thoroughly
discussed
here.
if
there
are
no
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
had
not
seen
that
issue
in
this
case,
previous
to
this
morning.
and
i'm
not
satisfied,
as
i
stand
here,
that
it's
any
more
than
a
question
of
fact
under
the
state
law
as
to
whether
or
not
the
person
was,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
contempt
of
the
commission.
there
may
be
a
due
process
question
involved
in
the
entire
concept
of
ignorance
of
the
law
being
no
excuse
under
certain
circumstances,
i
don't
know,
but
that's
the
way
the
thing
is
handled
in
ohio.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
except
that
they
were
informed
that
the
law
had
been
decided
in
ohio,
previous
to
that
day,
contrary
to
that
position.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
well,
for
purposes
of
security
to
these
witnesses
giving
answers,
nowhere,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
they
aren't
binding
for
some
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
when
you
talk
about
due
process
and
the
security
in
the
mind
of
the
individual
that
he
has
a
right
to
rely,
he
can't
rely
on
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
any
county
in
the
state
of
ohio
because
he
may
be
--
it
may
be
reversed
by
the
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
supreme
court.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
may
have
painted
the
picture
a
little
too
black
in
talking
about
the
general
understanding
of
the
difference
between
commission
and
committee,
but
i'm
frank
to
point
it
out
because
it
did
trouble
the
justice
--
judge
taft
in
his
dissent
in
the
state
court,
that
he
didn't
think
that
the
immunity
statute
applied
and
he
didn't
even
think,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
indictment
was
properly
raised
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
in
the
morgan
and
raley
cases
because
it
punished
contempts
criminally
by
committees.
it
was
generally
understood,
though,
at
the
hearing
by
people.
they
were
told,
the
witnesses,
that
this
was
a
subcommittee
within
the
meaning
of
this
rule,
and
they
had
immunity.
but
i
do
not
deny
for
a
minute
that
your
point
is
valid
that
the
witness
had
no
right
to
rely
on
that.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
well,
if
the
court
--
supreme
court
of
the
state
had
held
that
the
common
pleas
court
was
wrong
and
that,
thereafter,
they
could
be
prosecuted
and
they
didn't
have
immunity,
of
course,
that
would
have
indeed
been
a
due
process
situation.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
and
i
suppose,
in
that
sense,
they
might
have
had
a
right
to
rely
on
the
federal
due
process
clause,
but
that's
--
that's
asking
a
defendant
before
a
--
or
respondent
to
assume
a
lot
by
way
of
what
might
happen
to
him
in
the
--
in
the
future.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
all
of
these
cases,
as
i
understand
you
to
mean,
franklin
county
cases
are
reported.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
excuse
me.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
you
are
talking
about
the
one
that
was
--
that
was
enunciated
to
the
witness
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
reported
somewhere,
but
i
don't
have
it
here.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
it
is
not
in
the
record,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
in
every
library,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
sure
of
that.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
under
ohio
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
should
like
to
be
permitted
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
to
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
to
do
that.
if
the
court
would
desire
to
have
some
further
assistant
by
way
of
supplementary
briefs
and
just
sorting
out
who
was
directed
to
answer,
what
and
what
questions
apply
and
research
through
all
these
different
defendants.
i'd
be
glad
to
do
that.
i
don't
want
to
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
it
would
require
quite
a
bit
of
individual
research
on
the
parties
for
each
member
of
the
court.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
i
don't
think
that
would
be
difficult
--
mr.
norman
j.
putman
--
to
do.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
alright,
sir.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
thank
you.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
mr.
norman
j.
putman
will
i
need
to
defend
it
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
norman
j.
putman
thank
you,
sir.
