justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
the
number
one
process
before
us?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
directly
understand
that
there
are
two
patents
involved?
one
the
1954
patent,
ending
in
the
numbers
536
for
a
process
or
a
method
and
another
of
the
1957
patent,
ending
in
the
numbers
417
is
for
an
apparatus?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
correct?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thank
you.
now,
in
its
marketing
program,
the
respondent
prepares
a
standard
printed
form
of
contract.
and
these
terms
have
been
substantially
the
same
from
the
time
of
leasing
the
number
one
process
up
through
the
leasing
of
the
number
two
process.
and
there
are,
however,
some
--
over
that
period,
some
45
different
agreements
used.
in
this
agreement,
the
respondent
represents
that
it
is
the
owner
or
otherwise
has
the
right
to
grant
licenses
under
inventions
and
let
his
patent
pertaining
to
and
covering
methods
and
apparatus
used
in
the
number
one
or
the
number
two
process
depending
on
which
it's
licensing.
but
it
usually
does
not
spec
--
specify
the
patents
or
doesn't
specifically
identify
the
patents
or
any
inventions.
it
has
never
submitted
a
--
any
license
agreement
under
any
specific
single
patent.
i
said,
usually
because
in
some
seven
patents
or
seven
agreements,
it
has
listed
patents.
in
one
of
these
agreements,
it
will
show
in
this
case,
none
of
the
36
patents
listed,
was
applicable
to
the
system
or
--
or
even
to
the
process
that
it
was
licensing.
and
then
in
the
agreement
--
in
the
agreements
with
six
other
companies,
the
respondent
in
at
least
three
--
with
at
least
three
of
these
companies,
it
included
patents
which
were
clearly
inapplicable
to
the
process
that
it
was
licensing
and
that
will
--
i
believe,
be
a
significance
in
our
argument
on
compulsory
package
licensing
of
patents.
now,
continuing
with
the
facts,
i
say
in
addition
to
retaining
title
to
the
equipment,
respondent
reserves
the
right
to
make
changes
in
the
?
in
the
equipment.
and
in
consideration
of
the
fees
it
gets,
it
agrees
to
supply
replacement
parts
including
staple
commodities,
as
well
as
it
agrees
to
--
to
supply
services.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
you
say
staple
commodities,
do
i
understand
you
to
mean
non-patented
things?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thanks.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
do
you
have
to
buy
those
non-patented
things
from
transfers
or
can
you
get
it
from
hardware
store?
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr
mcsweeney.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
has
not
the
district
judge
foreclosed
you
on
your
argument
of
tie-ins
of
parts
by
finding
65
where
it
says
that,
although
much
of
the
specialized
equipment
required
for
the
practice
of
the
process
was
and
is
not
available
on
the
open
market.
and
then
has
produced
the
same
and
furnished
it
to
its
licensees
in
order
to
be
able
to
market
its
processes.
it
has
always
been
the
expressed
policy
of
the
defendant
and
so
understood
by
all
its
officers
that
if
a
prospective
licensee
prefers
to
obtain
equipment
elsewhere,
then
from
the
defendant
he
was
free
to
do
so
and
that
reduced
fees
could
obtain
a
license
from
defendant
without
equipment,
et
cetera.?
now
does
--what
about
that
finding
in
connection
with
your
argument
of
tie-in
on
parts?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
in
respondents'
brief
that
they
initially
came
to
you,
tried
to
induce
your
company
to
do
their
manufacturing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
are
findings
here
i
observed
that
ransburg
decided
not
to
make
anything
that
could
be
purchased
and
it
would
only
manufacture
what
wasn't
available
on
the
market.
is
that
so
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
supported
by
evidence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
tell
me,
do
you
contend
it
was
monopolistic
or
otherwise
illegal
for
them
to
have
a
form
of
agreement
requiring
the
supplying
of
the
apparatus
if
they
gave
to
the
customers
a
choice
to
take
with
it
--
the
process
without
it
--
without
the
equipment
--
apparatus?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wasn't
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wasn't
that
as
the
court
found
because
the
customers
so
elected
thus,
between
the
choices?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
find
--
in
finding
70,
the
court
deals
with
this.of
--
at
record
2003,
doesn't
it?
unless
the
terms
upon
which
defendant
would
have
quoted
in
number
two
process
non-equipment
license,
had
the
request,
therefore,
have
been
made
were
academic
until
1954
and
then
it
goes
on.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
there
or
was
there
not,
in
this
voluminous
record,
much
evidence
on
the
course
of
practice
in
daily
life,
or
i
guess,
this
ransburg
company?
