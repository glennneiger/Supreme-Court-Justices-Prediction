justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
claim
that
was
not
enough
to
purge
and
that
was
not
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
mr.
mcsweeney,
just
those
words
that
you've
pointed
to
us
at
page
32,
subject
to
such
changes
therein
and
the
incorporation
of
the
ransburg's
drawing
--
drawings,
is
that
all
there
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
i'm
--
what
i'm
asking
is,
is
that
what
you
tell
us
shows
that
there's
nothing
but
a
hobson's
choice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
nobody
ever
took
this
alternative
agreement.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
what
does
the
record
show?
don't
let
--
get
back
to
the
findings
too
far,
if
you
will.
but
what
is
the
nature
of
the
evidence
which
explains
why
no
one
took
this
form
of
agreement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
anything
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
safe
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you've
spoken
now
to
the
process
number
one
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
i
gather
mr.
gilliom
the
reason
for
this
is
if
i
understood
what
you
are
telling
us,
is
that
this
equipment
was
not
generally
available
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
other
places.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
no
one
had
had
any
interest
in
manufacturing
in
the
competition
with
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
manufacturing
it
themselves
as
they
were
licensee.
