mr.

gilliom
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
--
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
first
to
supplement
the
statement
of
facts
which
mr.
mcsweeney
made
briefly
and
then
to
treat
each
of
the
questions
raised
by
the
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
the
briefs.
the
issues
before
this
court
arise
out
of
a
series
of
the
events
starting
back
in
about
1957.
the
ransburg
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
justice
douglas.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
mr.
justice
douglas.
we
answered
the
government's
brief
at
two
--
there
are
two
points
in
our
brief
in
reply
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
first
point
in
which
the
government
expressed
interest
was
the
matter
of
alleged
tying
of
equipment
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
--
to
the
patent
licenses
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
i
will
handle
that.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
i
will.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
we
do
not
your
honor.
that
is
the
very
point,
in
other
words
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
we
--
we
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
beg
you
pardon?
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
we
do
not
start
with
that
assumption
at
all.
in
fact,
your
honor,
a
point
that
we
make
in
our
brief
is
just
to
the
opposite.
the
government
has
assumed
the
effect
which
did
not
exist
and
against
it,
the
expressed
findings
of
the
trial
court
are
very
clear.
in
other
words,
we
do
not
concede
any
misuse
prior
to
1953.
we
very
empathically
state
that
there
was
not,
our
policy
was
consistent
from
the
time
this
company
was
organized
until
the
time
of
the
trial
has
remained
so.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i'll
--
i'll
be
glad
to.
the
ransburg
company
started
out
as
the
soul
proprietorship,
manufacturing
housewares
such
as
bread
boxes,
canister
sets,
waste
baskets
and
so
forth.
and
they
spray
painted
these
products
with
ordinary
conventional
spray
guns
made
by
the
large
manufacturers
such
as
the
binks
company.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
waste
paint
that
came
from
that
process,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
air
blast
carried
the
paint
beyond
the
product
and
wasted
it
and
had
to
be
exhausted
and
much
of
it
was
not
recovered.
it
was
as
a
result
of
experiments
started
by
mr.
ransburg's
sons
back
in
1937
that
they
developed
this
number
one
process,
which
was
simply
using
a
compressed
air
spray
gun
the
same
type,
to
atomize
the
paint.
but
combining
with
it,
an
electrostatic
field
which
imparted
charges
to
the
paint
particles
and
attracted
them
to
the
articles
of
manufacture,
thereby,
tending
to
overcome
the
effect
of
the
air
blast
and
making
a
more
efficient
painting
operation.
now,
that
number
one
process
which
has
been
referred
to
here
as
the
air
type
process
is
not
before
this
court,
we
submit
for
the
reason
that
since
1950
as
the
trial
court
found,
there
have
been
at
least
six
firms
in
competition
with
each
other,
marketing
the
air
type
systems.the
binks
company,
representatives
testified
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
obstacle
to
their
marketing,
the
air
type
electrostatic
systems,
since
they
first
became
interested
in
it,
but
they
elected
not
to
do
so
until
1958.
the
issues
before
this
court
are
confined
to
the
so-called
airless
systems
or
the
number
two
system
which
briefly
is
this.
instead
of
a
compressed
air
spray
gun
to
atomize
the
paint,
it's
atomized
either
by
means
of
a
stationary
atomizing
head
or
rotating
disks
or
bells,
which
feed
the
paint
at
a
control
rate
to
a
zone
of
atomization
at
the
edge
of
the
head
where
the
power
of
the
electrostatic
field
itself
tears
off
this
atomized
particles
of
paint
from
the
liquid
film
and
disperses
it
in
the
form
of
the
spray
and
deposits
it
upon
the
article
of
manufacture.
the
field
is
maintained
in
that
case
directly
between
atomizing
head
and
the
articles
of
manufacture
on
the
conveyer.
now,
it
was
on
this
improved
process
which
in
many
cases
results
in
almost
100%
efficiency
in
the
deposit
of
paint
and
therefore,
saves
a
great
deal
in
paint
cost
as
well
as
labor
cost.
it's
on
this
process
that
these
two
patents
were
acquired
by
application
of
the
ransburg
company.
one,
for
the
method
of
painting
in
that
manner
and
the
other
with
respect
to
the
apparatus,
the
method
patent
as
i
think
the
court
has
observed,
was
issued
in
1954
and
the
apparatus
patent
came
out
in
1957,
probably
these
proceedings
were
pending
in
the
trial
court
and
was
brought
in
by
supplemental
pleadings.
now,
when
the
company
brought
out
these
processes
for
public
use,
it
found
as
would
anyone
that
had
an
idea
to
market,
that
in
order
to
sell
that
idea
to
industry
and
to
persuade
manufacturers
of
consumer
goods
that
this
was
a
better
way
to
paint
their
products,
they
have
to
supply
the
tools
for
doing
that.
many
of
the
components
of
this
specialized
equipment
were
not
available
on
the
open
market.
that
was
true
when
the
number
one
system
was
brought
out
in
about
1944.
it
was
also
true
when
the
number
two
system
came
out.
when
the
number
one
system
came
out,
there
was
not
a
safe
voltage
supply
or
power
pack.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
the
voltage
supply
or
power
pack.
in
other
words,
the
ones
that
were
available
for
that
time
for
x-ray
purposes
and
so
forth
put
out
too
much
current
and
were
likely
to
cause
a
lethal
shock
or
a
fire.
the
same
thing
was
true
with
respect
to
the
electrodes
and
the
controls
of
the
electrical
equipment.
ransburg
contacted
such
firms
as
general
electric
company,
a
number
of
others
to
attempt
to
interest
them
in
making
this
special
equipment.
ransburg's
interest
being
in
licensing
the
process,
it
was
not
interested
in
the
equipment.
it
had
no
success
i'd
suppose
partially,
because
that
was
during
the
war
period
and
these
companies
had
bigger
fish
to
fry.
as
a
result,
it
had
to
design
its
own
power
pack,
its
own
control,
its
own
electrodes
and
produce
them
in
order
to
get
anyone
to
take
this
process
or
to
consider
it
for
their
production
lines.
the
same
thing
was
true
when
the
number
two
process
came
out.
these
special
atomizing
heads
were
not
available.
they
were
absolutely
new.
the
same
thing
was
true
with
respect
to
the
accurately
controllable
paint
supply
system
and
that
was
a
very
crucial
aspect
of
this
rather
delicate
system.
and
the
fact
is
that
ransburg
did
contact
the
other
large
manufacturers
among
whom
were
binks.
the
court
asked
whether
there
was
any
evidence
of
that
supporting
finding
number
10
and
if
the
court
will
refer
to
volume
3
of
the
record
page
240,
mr.
roche,
the
president
of
the
binks
company
himself,
testified
that
they
sold
the
equipment
in
conjunction
with
the
systems
that
ransburg
put
out.
and
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
spray
guns,
paint
spray
boots,
air
paint
exhaust
systems,
air
make
up
systems
and
so
forth,
were
sold
by
companies
like
binks.
when
the
number
two
system
was
being
marketed,
ransburg
had
problems
with
respect
to
the
paint
supply
which
had
to
be
controlled
very
accurately
and
it
discussed
that
with
the
binks
company
among
other
people,
which
appears
from
volume
1
of
the
record,
page
710
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
rice
where
he
said,
they
couldn't
--
this
is
talking
about
the
airless
system.
he
said
they
couldn't
use
a
standard
circulating
system
or
pressure
regulators
--
regulators
that
we
had
used
in
our
line.
they
even
requested
us
at
one
time,
to
make
up
a
special
regulator
to
operate
at
the
low
pressures,
if
they
need
it.
those
were
the
steps
that
the
company
took
to
obtain
assistance
in
getting
the
equipment
necessary
to
interest
industry
in
this
very
valuable
device.
it
ended
up
that
ransburg
itself,
although
a
small
concern
had
to
design
this
equipment
with
the
help
of
a
man
who
was
well-versed
in
electrical
science
and
had
been
on
a
faculty
of
purdue
university.
as
it
began
the
marketing
systems
and
industry
began
to
see
the
value,
ransburg
made
this
equipment
available
along
with
its
licenses
on
a
leased
basis.
now,
the
--
the
contact
essentially
was
a
written
license
to
use
the
process
as
long
as
the
process
patent
was
the
only
one
that
ransburg
have.
the
contract
also
said,
however,
that
the
company
owned
inventions
and
patent
applications
that
have
to
do
with
methods
and
apparatus
for
electrostatic
painting.
so
that,
whoever
took
one
of
the
written
licenses
was
licensed
not
only
under
the
patents
it
had,
but
under
the
inventions
and
applications
that
were
pending.
now,
the
equipment
which
was
made
available
to
these
manufactures
was
entirely
at
the
option
of
the
manufacturers.
the
trial
court
found
as
a
fact
and
the
evidence
supports
it
amply
that
there
never
was
any
requirement
on
the
part
of
ransburg,
there
was
never
any
forcing
that
anyone
take
equipment
in
any
instance
whatever.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
sir.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
either
one
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
either
one,
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
this
record
can
be
read
from
the
first
page
to
the
last
and
there
is
not
that
first
bit
of
evidence
from
any
licensee
or
prospective
licensee
or
otherwise,
that
he
ever
asked
to
have
this
license
without
equipment
and
couldn't
get
it.
that
he
was
ever
discouraged
from
asking
for
a
license
without
equipment
or
that
the
terms
upon
which
an
alternative
was
available,
were
not
fair
and
adequate.
now
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
the
evidence
on
that
mr.
justice
black
is
that
up
until
1954,
no
one
had
ever
shown
any
interest
whatever,
in
a
non-equipment
license.
and
in
1954,
after
the
ransburg
company
had
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
it
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
a
non-equipment
license
has
been
available
as
a
matter
of
company
policy
since
the
beginning.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
it
was
known
to
all
the
ransburg
personnel
to
be
available
and
the
salesmen
were
instructed
to
--
to
let
their
prospects
know
that.
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
exactly.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
exactly.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
think
that's
correct.
and
i
believe
the
reason
for
it
appears
from
the
very
fact
that
in
a
period
of
approximately
five
years,
when
the
number
two
process
was
introduced
to
1951
up
until
the
time
of
the
trial,
there
had
only
been
a
few
entered
licenses
granted.
i
think
the
simple
explanation
is
that
the
equipment
manufacturers
were
not
interested
in
that
kind
of
volume.
in
other
words,
this
is
not
a
shelf
--
a
store
shelf
item,
where
you
can
count
on
so
many
thousand
of
year,
which
would
warrant
the
research
and
development
and
everything
that's
involved
in
putting
an
item
on
the
shelf.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
each
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
none,
whatever.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
the
evidence
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
page
30
--
32
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
the
only
written
form
of
contract
was
the
one
on
page
32
or
slight
revisions
of
that.
i
think
in
full
answer
to
your
question,
i
would
have
to
go
back
a
little
mr.
justice
black
and
say
this.
that
prior
to
1953,
the
ransburg
company
did
not
prepare
form
contracts,
standard
contracts
for
non-equipment
licenses.
in
1953,
out
of
what
i
would
call
a
super
(inaudible)
some
caution,
they
prepared
those
forms
for
the
first
time
although
no
one
had
ever
asked
for
one
or
had
shown
any
interest
in
them,
even
though
it
had
always
been
the
policy
that
anyone
who
wanted
a
non-equipment
license
could
have
it.
but
it's
applied
those
forms
and
there
have
been
one
or
two
revisions
since
then,
but
in
substance,
they
have
been
the
same.
so
that
that
is
the
only
form
that
has
ever
been
submitted
to
anyone
if
that
is
the
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
the
contract
does
not
require
it.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no.
each
of
the
contracts
with
respect
to
the
number
two
system
at
least,
has
included
the
obligation
of
ransburg
to
supply
the
equipment
on
a
lease
basis.
but
at
the
time
of
negotiation,
the
prospective
licensee
was
absolutely
free
to
take
either
a
license
without
that
equipment
or
to
take
it,
once
he
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
if
the
court
will
note
though,
that
language
which
was
referred
to
by
mr.
mcsweeney
it
says,
subject
to
such
changes
therein
and
further
specifications
as
ransburg
may
prescribe.
in
other
words,
if
a
man
had
a
license
to
use
a
--
use
a
unit
of
somebody
else's
equipment
under
this
non-equipment
license
and
if
there
were
some
aspect
of
that
which
would
improve
operations,
ransburg
reserve
the
right
to
specify
what
the
change
might
be.
not
to
designate
its
equipment,
but
specification,
a
reasonable
specification
which
could
be
met
by
anybody's
equipment.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that
is
a
--
what
might
be
called
a
typical
shipment
memorandum
of
the
items
that
went
to
a
costumer
who
had
elected
to
take
the
license
with
the
ransburg
equipment.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
oh
yes,
yes.
our
point
is,
however,
that
the
--
that
the
man
who
wanted
the
license
under
the
patent,
was
not
required
to
take
this
at
all.
but
once
he
had
said
he
wanted
it,
it
was
shipped
to
him,
in
accordance
with
this
list.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
not
one.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
not
one.
the
binks
company
took
the
depositions
of
--
as
i
recall
three
or
four
representatives
of
companies
that
had
dealt
with
ransburg
and
each
one
of
those
deponents
testified
that
his
company
had
taken
the
license
with
equipment.
two
or
three
of
them
said
they
weren't
aware
that
they
could've
had
a
non-equipment
license
or
nobody
told
them
about
it.
but
they
did
not
say
that
they
were
forced
or
required
to
take
it.
on
the
contrary,
each
one
of
them
as
the
court
found
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
said
that,
we
went
to
ransburg
for
the
equipment.
it
was
the
equipment
that
we
were
interested
in.
witness
wallin,
who
represented
the
webcor
company,
said
that
ransburg
advised
him
in
writing
that
he
could've
had
either
one.
the
contract
with
or
without
equipment
and
that
his
company
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
engineering
that
would
be
involved
to
get
the
equipment
somewhere
else,
they
wanted
to
experience
company
to
franchise
it
and
they
elected
to
take
it.
but
not
a
single
costumer
or
prospect
has
testified
either
in
their
position
otherwise
that
he
felt
forced
or
required
to
take
the
equipment
or
anything
else
to
get
a
license.
now,
the
--
the
policy
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
session
yesterday,
i
had
touched
on
most
of
the
facts
i
think
that
bore
on
the
first
issue
of
alleged
tie-in
of
equipment
to
patent
licenses
but
there
are
some
facts
which
i
would
like
to
bring
before
the
court
that
i
had
no
chance
to
mention
yesterday
and
to
pursue
that
argument
briefly
and
then
go
to
the
other
points
in
the
order
in
which
they
appear
in
the
brief.
the
ransburg
company,
as
soon
as
it
had
had
about
a
year
and
a
half
experience
with
its
number
two
system
or
process
had
a
cost
accounting
study
made
by
the
firm
of
ernst
&
ernst,
nationally
known
cost
accountants
to
determine
what
the
proper
differential
would
be
if
it
were
to
be
asked
by
anyone
for
one
of
these
licenses
without
its
equipment.
and
that
differential
was
determined
in
such
way
that
the
ransburg
company
issued
a
pricing
schedule
available
to
anyone
who
wanted
it
in
which
it
eliminated
from
the
initial
fee
which
would
otherwise
be
payable
if
the
equipment
reference
to
license,
60%
of
that
amount.
that
was
the
equivalent
of
about
150%
of
the
full
cost
including
burden
and
profit
on
the
equipment
which
ransburg
furnished
when
the
users
wanted
it.
so
that
was
completely
taken
out
to
permit
anybody
else
to
furnish
equipment
under
one
of
these
pure
licenses
if
anyone
had
been
so
inclined.
the
monthly
fees
were
likewise
revised
to
eliminate
all
of
the
element
of
rent
and
all
of
the
element
of
replacing
defective
parts,
which
was
one
--
which
was
the
continuing
ransburg
obligation
in
the
equipment
license.
now,
when
those
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
government
in
its
memorandum
said
that
there
were
100
odd
that
were
outstanding
which
were
entered
into
prior
to
1953
that's
why
they're
more
than
a
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
since
that
time,
those
that
are
still
in
effect,
i
think
total
to
about
337.
there
have
been
more
issued
but
some
of
them
of
course
have
been
terminated
by
the
users
when
their
operations
changed
for
some
such
thing.
but
i
think
about
337
would
be
the
total.
now,
the
--
there
was
no
evidence
which
was
introduced
by
binks
or
otherwise
before
the
trial
court
that
questioned
the
sufficiency
of
that
price
differential
and
the
trial
court
found
that
it
was
a
due
and
proper
allowance.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
contention
of
the
government
at
this
point
with
respect
to
this
alleged
tie-in.
the
government's
memorandum
starts
out
with
the
assumption
on
page
3
that
there
was
tie-in
in
the
prohibited
sense
prior
to
1953,
and
that
these
letters
which
were
written
to
ransburg's
licensees
in
the
1953
were
an
ineffective
attempt
at
a
purge.
as
i
stated
in
answer
to
--
to
one
of
mr.
justice
douglas'
questions
yesterday,
we
have
not
taken
the
position
at
any
time
that
these
efforts
to
inform
prospective
licensees
and
present
licensees
in
1953
that
these
non-equipment
licenses
were
available,
was
any
attempt
at
a
purge.
there
was
no
occasion
for
it.
there
was
no
change
in
the
company's
policy
at
that
time.
and
the
trial
court
so
found
in
finding
65
that
it
had
always
been
the
policy
of
ransburg
that
anyone
who
might
wish
a
pure
license
without
equipment,
installation,
supervision
or
replacement
of
defective
parts
could
have
it.
he
had
to
pay
for
none
of
those
things
if
he
wanted
to
get
them
elsewhere.
and
the
testimony
of
the
salesmen
whom
--
whose
deposition
binks
took
was
very
clear
on
that
point.
mr.
pleva
said,
this
is
in
volume
1
of
the
record
at
page
627.
“i
have
never
really
tried
to
sell
anyone
on
taking
the
license
without
equipment
but
i
always
told
them
it
was
available
that
way.”
in
other
words,
he
did
not
limit
that
to
post-1953.
that
had
always
been
the
policy.
by
1953,
the
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
none
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
sir.
there
was
no
licensee
or
prospective
licensee
that
testified
by
deposition
or
otherwise
after
most
extensive
discovered
proceedings
in
which
all
of
the
customer
files
were
opened
to
binks
that
he
was
forced
to
require
to
take
anything
in
order
to
get
a
license
under
the
patents.
therefore,
the
assumption
that
the
government
makes
is
entirely
unwarranted
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
fact
was
just
the
opposite
and
there
was
no
tie-in
prior
to
1953
and
there
was
no
occasion
of
course
for
a
purge.
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
now
on
this
--
on
the
decision
in
b.b.
chemical
company
versus
ellis.
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
a
question
about
that
yesterday.
in
that
case,
the
court
will
recall,
the
conclusion
was
reached
that
the
patent
owner
who
had
a
patent
on
a
process
of
making
insoles
for
shoes
involving
a
certain
cemented
webbing,
followed
a
practice
of
not
issuing
written
licenses
to
anybody.
a
license
went
by
implication
when
he
sold
his
material
to
the
shoe
manufacturer.
and
that
conduct,
the
court
found
was
within
the
--
the
leitch
doctrine
and
the
carbice
doctrine.
in
other
words,
no
choice
was
given
to
the
prospect
except
to
buy
that
material
to
get
the
license.
now,
there
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
an
argument
made
at
that
late
stage
that
if
somebody
had
wanted
an
--
a
license
without
the
materials,
they
would
have
been
willing
to
grant
it.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
comes
too
late,
that
to
say
that
of
this
stage
of
the
game
because
that
raises
the
question
of
whether
when
you
take
into
account
the
subtleties
of
cost
accounting,
the
license
would
be
a
realistic
alternative.
in
other
words,
the
competitor
might
be
placed
at
a
disadvantage
as
that
court
said
by
the
fact
that
the
patent
owner
would
not
make
the
terms
equivalent
to
the
terms
under
which
the
patent
owner
itself
with
franchise
materials.
now
in
this
case
by
contrast,
long
before
this
case
was
tried,
this
policy
was
established,
the
cost
accounting
study
was
made
and
an
adequate
differential
was
established.
so
i
think
the
case
is
clearly
distinguishable
on
that
point.
the
government
relies
largely
in
its
brief
on
page
3
in
support
of
its
argument,
upon
the
proposition,
and
i
might
say
the
government
has
not
made
any
contention
if
there
was
any
tie-in
after
1953.
they
relate
their
charge
entirely
to
the
period
from
the
middle
1951
to
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
--
1953.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
the
explanation
of
that
letter
appears
in
the
testimony
of
mr.
harold
ransburg
and
he
said
what
the
purpose
of
it
was.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
let
me
find
the
reference
to
his
testimony.
that
is
record
one,
page
464.
in
substance,
i
think
there's
no
question
with
what
the
ransburg
company
at
that
point
had
been
advised
by
patent
counsel
to
be
careful
in
this
program
that
it
did
make
licenses
available
to
people
without
equipment
if
they
wanted
them.
and
that
had
been
its
policy
for
a
number
of
years
of
course
before
that,
but
it
was
emphasized
at
that
point.
now,
harold
ransburg
said
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no
specific
occasion,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
no.
i
think
it
was
just
that
a
growing
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
this
was
the
middle
of
1953
about
july
as
i
recall.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
well,
i
think
there
was
a
growing
awareness
on
the
part
of
all
persons
who
had
patents
and
who
were
exploiting
them
one
way
or
another
of
the
doctrine
of
misuse
so
that
they
were
all
being
more
careful
not
to
transgress
the
law
in
that
respect.
and
i
think
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
--
that
was
said
to
the
ransburg
company.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
think
not
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
think
not
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
think
if
there
was
any
one
decision
that
might
have
prompted
that,
it
was
the
decision
in
the
cardox
case
in
the
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
--
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
which
was
--
just
before
that
time.
i
think
that
figured
a
review
of
this
thing
in
the
minds
of
those
who
are
responsible
for
it.
but
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
oh,
yes.
yes,
much
earlier.
yes,
those
--
the
doctrines
were
well-established
and
ransburg
in
--
in
living
by
those
rules
all
the
time.
but
as
--
as
harold
ransburg
said
in
his
testimony,
he
thought,
as
the
vice-president
of
the
company,
that
this
was
not
necessary
to
do
this
in
1953.
but
that
he
was
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that
is
on
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
mr.
ransburg's
testimony
is
on
463
of
volume
i,
mr.
justice
brennan
or
--
and
where
you'll
find.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
his
explanation
is
464
of
the
next
page.
he
said
that
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
that's
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
that's
right.
he
--
he
explained
it
that
way.
then
on
the
next
page,
he
said
that
he
was
hardly
in
favor
of
it
however
because
he
felt
that
these
salesmen
should
be
reminded
periodically
with
bulletins
every
year
or
so
that
they
should
not
overlook
in
discussing
with
their
customers
this
program
that
these
licenses
were
available.
and
he
says
that,
right
at
the
middle
of
the
page
there,
so
that
they
wouldn't
overlook
and
forget
that
that
was
available
if
anyone
should
want
it.
he
says
on
the
next
paragraph,
“no
one
had
ever
asked
for
a
license
without
equipment.
they
might
be
easily
forget
that
they
had
been
given
such
advice."
so
that
was
the
reason
for
it.
they've
decided
at
that
time
that
they
wouldn't
rely
upon
the
salesman's
memory
to
tell
these
people
that
these
licenses
were
available
and
that
they
would
write
letters
to
every
customer,
every
prospect
before
he
executed
agreement
and
say,
“this
agreement
provides
for
equipment,
installation,
supervision
and
replacement
of
defective
parts.
we
assume
that
you
want
this
rather
than
one
that
doesn't
provide
that"
and
so
that
they
all
had
written
notice.
the
sales
brochures
were
changed
at
the
same
time
so
that
it
said
very
clearly,
“when
desired,
the
equipment
will
be
furnished
by
ransburg.”
and
the
brochure
advertised
the
process
or
the
method,
not
the
equipment.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no
other
companies
manufactured
the
equipment
as
a
unit
or
as
a
whole.
of
course,
the
nuts
and
bolts
and
things
like
that
were
--
were
manufactured
by
other
--
other
manufacturers
but
nobody
manufactured
airless
painting
equipment
as
such.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
you
mean
had
anything
to
do
with
sending
the
letter
out
itself?
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
this
particular
process,
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
wouldn't
think
so,
mr.
chief
justice
for
this
reason.
the
grant-back
provision
which
i
had
intended
to
discuss
a
little
later
but
i
had
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
so
i
am
--
well
then
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
thank
you.
i'll
just
--
just
to
complete
the
statement
of
facts
with
respect
to
the
1953
transaction.
after
it
was
decided
to
be
sure
that
all
perspective
licensees
knew
of
the
alternative,
it
was
felt
also
that
the
current
licensees
of
which
there
were
100
odd
number
two
system
should
know
about
this
thing
and
so
several
types
of
letters
were
written.
there
was
a
--
a
letter
written
to
those
who
had
already
entered
into
agreements
that
--
but
haven't
made
their
payments
of
their
initial
fees
saying,
“if
you
would
prefer
not
to
take
this
equipment,
you
can
have
the
license
and
your
initial
fee
will
be
appropriately
reduced
in
giving
the
amount
in
the
same
way
of
the
monthly
fee.”
those
customers
who
already
have
equipment
and
had
paid
for
it
and
were
using
it,
there
was
no
offer
to
rebate
any
of
the
initial
fee.
those
licenses
had
been
in
effect
of
course
for
various
terms
from
almost
two
years
on
down
and
it
was
felt
that
the
initial
fee
had
been
earned.
but
the
customers
were
told
clearly
that
for
any
reason
they
would
prefer
to
change
equipment
and
reduce
their
monthly
fees
which
were
the
important
aspect
of
this
in
the
manufactures
program
that
that
could
be
done.
this
was
not
done,
however,
in
any
spirit
by
ransburg
that
those
people
had
originally
been
forced
to
require
to
take
equipment
because
the
policy
had
been
clear
at
the
time
of
those
licenses
were
entered
into.
now,
the
government
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
not
this
type
of
letter,
no.
the
bulletin
is
what
he's
talking
about
to
the
sales
personnel,
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
sales
personnel
and
all
the
management
personnel
got
these
bulletins
about
once
a
year
which
are
referred
to
in
finding
65
reminding
them
each
time
to
be
sure
and
tell
your
prospects
about
this
alternative.
the
letters
to
the
customers,
there
--
these
bunch
of
1953
letters,
that
was
the
only
occasion
when
this
was
done
wholesale.
from
thereon
however,
before
anybody
entered
into
a
license,
he
got
a
letter
specifically
stating
what
was
available.
now,
the
government
has
relied
principally
upon
one
fact
in
support
of
its
contention
that
there
was
tie-in
prior
--
prior
to
1953
and
that
is
that
all
of
these
100
odd
licensees
had
the
equipment
and
i'd
simply
like
to
explain
how
that
comes
about.
the
fact
is
that
they
all
wanted
the
equipment.
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone
was
forced
to
take
it
and
when
you
realize
how
these
manufactures
of
refrigerators,
bicycles,
typewriters
became
interested
in
this
thing,
it's
easy
to
understand
why
they
all
took
the
equipment.
ransburg's
laboratories
would
design
for
each
of
these
people
a
system,
these
were
not
shelf
items,
they
had
to
be
designed
and
engineered
for
each
system,
for
each
application
because
of
the
size
and
the
shape
of
the
article,
the
coating
material
and
other
production
problems.
they
would
design
this
thing
in
their
laboratory,
set
it
up,
invite
them
in
to
come
and
see
it.
when
he
saw
it
operated
and
he
saw
the
savings
that
were
possible
in
his
business,
the
thing
he
said
is,
“i
want
that
equipment.
when
can
i
get
it?”
he
didn't
want
a
piece
of
paper,
he
couldn't
paint
with
just
a
license
and
he
wanted
the
equipment
from
someone
who
had
experience
in
furnishing
it
and
that
he
saw,
worked
in
their
laboratory.
and
these
licensees
who
were
brought
by
deposition
before
the
court
all
testified,
“we
were
interested
in
the
equipment.
we
wanted
to
get
a
price
on
the
equipment.”
each
one
of
them
said
they
had
never
asked
for
a
license
and
of
course,
they
weren't
interested
in
it.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
the
normal
price?
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
it
would
vary,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
a
great
deal
because
some
of
these
installations
were
quite
large,
some
were
smaller.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
well,
yes,
they're
custom
designed
as
far
as
the
arrangement
and
the
components
were
concerned.
many
common
components
of
course
were
used.
but
they
were
all
especially
designed
and
engineered
and
the
actual
cost
of
the
equipment
plus
--
plus
profit
on
it
would
run
from
perhaps
$2000
of
$3000
on
up
to,
it
could
be
more.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
but
in
each
case,
the
non-equipment
license
reduced
the
fee
by
whatever
the
cost
of
all
odd
equipment
was
if
the
man
wanted
the
naked
license.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
--
i
said
that
each
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
oh,
no.
i
don't
mean
to
infer
that
--
that
every
part
in
it,
every
mechanical
part
was
especially
made,
but
the
system
as
a
whole
had
to
be
designed
for
the
customer.
the
relationship
to
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
not
all
of
them,
no.
the
atomizing
heads
were
and
the
paint
supply
controls
were,
a
number
of
those
things
were
--
of
course
there
were
other
things
that
were
not
custom-made
which
ransburg--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
if
they
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
is
that
page
4
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
on
volume
1.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
of
mr.
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
--
wallen?
now,
your
question
is
they
would
pay
more
in
one
instance?
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
the
way
--
that
was
the
letter
to
web
carr
on
the
unit
which
they've
had
and
they
had
already
paid
the
initial
fee
as
i
recall
which
was
earned
and
they
were
not
interested
in
changing
the
equipment
for
the
reduction
in
the
monthly
fee.
they
said
they
thought
that
was
ridiculous.
in
other
words,
they
wanted
to
retain
their
equipment
just
the
way
it
was.
but
in
the
--
in
an
initial
case,
a
person
who
took
the
license
without
the
equipment
would
not
pay
for
any
equipment
whatever.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no
indeed,
he
did
not.
in
other
words,
what
he
paid
for
the
license
was
exactly
the
same
whether
he
took
the
equipment
or
not.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
yes,
but
i
think
the
record
is
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that
is
correct,
in
order
--
in
other
words,
to
make
a
working
system
out
of
it
which
is
what
these
people
wanted.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
that's
what
it
was.
that's
where
the
engineering
came
in.
in
other
words
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that
--
that
was
not
the
--
the
case
in
this
instance.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
that's
correct.
they
were
some
parts,
although
they
were
minor
part.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
they
could've
done
that.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
no.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that's
correct.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
oh,
no,
not
at
all.
they
were
a
part
of
the
--
of
a
working
assembly.
in
other
words,
the
working
assembly,
to
paint
these
man's
products
had
to
have
common
place
parts
in
it
and
as
well
the
special
parts
so
that
the
thing
would
work.
that's
what
he
wanted
and
had
to
have.
otherwise,
he'd
had
to
go
out
and
gather
it
up
and
try
to
put
it
together.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
i
think
they
got
no
tools
as
like
hammers
and
files.
there
was
one
tool
called
a
tube
puller
which
was
for
removing
the
--
the
tube
from
the
power
pack
if
it
became
defective
and
had
to
be
replaced.
but
the
parts
that
we're
speaking
of,
mr.
justice
black
were
functional
parts,
a
part
of
this
entire
painting
unit
and
they
were
all
needed
for
its
function.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
was
any
of
it
not
common
plates?
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
indeed.
in
other
words,
these
atomi
--
atomizing
heads
were
not
common
parts.
they
--
they
were
the
--
the
thing
that
atomized
the
paint
and
there
were
paint
supply
controls
which
were
special.
they
were
not
common,
they
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
go
out
to
buy
those
somewhere
else.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
yes,
there
were
some.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
well,
i
--
i
don't
like
to
differentiate
on
--
on
--
when
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
they
--
they
were,
let's
put
it
this
way.
there
were
things
like
hose
and
a
couple
of
things,
things
like
that.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
you
can.
you
can
buy
those
anywhere.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
that's
right.
it's
in
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that's
right
and
they
simply
were
necessary
to
make
this
whole
thing
work.
that's
--
that's
where
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
as
i
understand
it,
with
the
possible
exception
of
this
tube
puller
which
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
well,
i
understood,
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
when
i
said
they
were
not
disjointed,
i
mean
that
they
were
not
something
set
aside
from
this
functioning
unit,
useful
in
connection
with
it.
but
they
were
a
part
of
this
unit,
they
were
an
operating
part.
they
had
to
be
running
along
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes
--
well
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
a
fair
illustration.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
in
the
wheel,
that's
right,
exactly.
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
point.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
they
were.
there
were
--
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
even
the
what?
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes,
it
is
--
it's
a
part
of
the
working
system.
you
--
you
couldn't
work
it
without
it.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
yes.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
surely.
oh,
as
i
say,
these
--
these
manufactures,
in
order
to
have
a
working
system
wanted
ransburg
to
furnish
an
outfit
that
would
operate
the
way
they
have
seen
it
operate
in
the
laboratory.
and
this
fact
is
--
i
think
accented
by
the
fact
it's
found
by
the
trail
court
that
after
these
people
had
been
told
in
1953
that
they
could
have
a
licensee
either
way,
55
of
the
people
who
got
those
letters
with
full
knowledge
of
it
entered
into
a
total
of
97
license
agreements
after
that
and
in
every
instance,
elected
to
take
the
equipment.
now,
the
time
is
running
so
i
must
go
on
to
i
think
the
next
question
involved.
the
binks
company
--
i
want
to
say
first
one
more
fact
with
respect
to
these
licenses.
the
binks
company
is
the
first
company
that
indicated
any
desire
to
furnish
airless
electrostatic
spray
painting
equipment.
after
the
ford
motor
company
asked
them
to
make
a
quote
on
a
unit
played
in
1955,
they
did
that
in
january
or
march.
in
january,
and
again
i
think
in
march
of
1956
and
they
quoted
on
it,
subject
to
ford
indemnifying
binks
against
liability
for
infringing
the
ransburg
patent.
of
course,
ford
did
not
buy
it.
then
binks
came
to
ransburg
and
asked
for
a
license
to
make
and
sell
under
the
starkey
and
ransburg
process
patent.
that
license
--
license
was
declined
by
ransburg
for
the
reason
that
it
would
have
treated
many
of
the
customers
unfairly
and
it
did
say
through
binks,
however,
“we
want
you
to
know
that
licenses
are
available
to
your
customers
to
use
our
method.”
in
other
words,
it
would
put
binks'
customers
on
the
same
footing
exactly
as
the
ransburg
licensees
so
that
they
could
use
the
binks'
equipment.
and
the
court
below
made
an
expressed
finding
along
that
line
and
we
feel
that
the
findings
of
the
court
with
respect
to
this
alleged
tie-in
are
amply
supported
by
the
evidence
and
should
stand.
now,
going
to
the
second
question
raised
by
the
petitioner,
the
alleged
tie-in
of
--
of
one
license
to
another
or
package
licensing.
the
contention
was
made
that
since
the
ransburg
contract
does
not
list
patent
numbers,
that
it
has
the
effect
of
forcing
the
licensee
to
take
a
license
under
patents
that
he
doesn't
want.
i
think
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
this
license
does
not
list
patent
number
simply
because
of
the
fact
these
systems
are
designed
individually.
and
after
a
system
is
designed
and
identified
in
a
drawing,
the
user
gets
the
right
to
use
all
ransburg
patents,
applications
or
inventions
whether
the
patents
have
issued
or
not
that
are
applicable
to
that
particular
system,
and
he
does
not
get
a
license
or
paid
for
a
license
under
any
patent
that
does
not
apply.
and
the
court
found
in
finding
71
that
there
had
never
been
any
request
for
a
license
under
a
specific
patent
and
no
one
had
ever
been
forced
to
take
a
license
under
any
patent
which
he
did
not
want,
so
that
the
rule
in
american
security
company
would
not
apply.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
how
large
is
it?
in
terms
of
gross
volume?
i
think
the
gross
volume
at
the
present
time
is
about
--
the
record
shows
was
$2.5
million
a
year
from
these
licenses
at
the
time
of
trial,
it's
slightly
more
than
that
now
as
i
recall.
now,
going
to
the
license-back
clause,
this
is
the
third
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
and
one
in
which
the
government
has
taken
an
interest.
the
government
contends
that
this
was
--
this
type
of
clause
could
be
illegal
if
it
had
the
effect
of
perpetuating
the
effective
life
from
a
basic
patent
on
page
8
of
their
memorandum.
now,
this
license-back
clause
had
no
such
effect.
in
the
first
place,
it
did
not
require
the
licensees
to
convey
their
inventions
to
ransburg.
it
simply
required
during
the
early
period
of
the
field
experience
and
the
number
of
due
process
when
technical
information
was
being
freely
exchanged
by
ransburg
with
these
licensees
in
an
effort
to
bring
this
--
this
process
to
its
best
application
in
all
faces
of
industry.
during
that
earlier
period,
it
was
felt
by
ransburg
that
any
improvements
made
by
these
licensees
that
had
the
benefit
of
that
early
experience
and
there
know-how
should
be
shared
by
ransburg
and
the
other
licensees.
to
do
that,
a
license-back
clause
of
a
restricted
nature
was
used
only
during
those
early
years,
about
three
and
a
half
years.
it
was
for
a
non-exquisite
license
where
the
right
to
sublicense
and
was
royalty
free
and
applied
only
in
this
particular
field
of
the
basic
patents.
therefore,
whoever
might
have
developed
an
improvement
and
it
turned
out
that
none
were,
no
right
was
ever
acquired
by
this
at
all.
but
whoever
might
have
developed
an
improvement
would
have
had
the
right
to
use
it
himself,
he
would
have
had
the
exclusive
right
to
it
except
in
this
particular
field
and
the
only
effect
would
be
that
ransburg
and
its
other
licensees
could
use
it
also.
it
would
not
have
prolonged
the
monopoly
of
the
basic
patents
because
at
the
time
the
basic
patents
expired,
ransburg
and
the
user
who
developed
the
improvement
would
be
on
the
same
footing
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
process.
so
we
feel
that
it
was
for
a
reasonable
purpose
and
it
was
for
a
reasonable
period,
it
was
eliminated
from
the
forms
in
1955.
and
that
it
was
a
--
a
reasonable
scope
and
that
it
involved
only
improvements
in
the
field
of
the
basic
patents
and
that
the
license
was
reasonable
because
it
was
usable
only
in
the
field
of
the
basic
patents.
and
as
i
say,
there
were
--
had
been
no
right
acquired
under
it
by
ransburg
and
the
only
time
that
one
was
tendered,
it
was
declined.
now,
the
statement
was
made
in
petitioner's
brief
for
the
time
in
this
case
that
some
of
these
are
still
in
effect.
the
fact
is
that
in
september
1959,
all
of
the
one
--
of
the
old
provisions
in
contracts
that
have
been
entered
into
prior
to
1955
were
cancelled
by
letter.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
why
they
were
eliminated
for
the
forms?
the
record
does
not
have
any
specific
evidence
as
to
why
they
were
eliminated
at
that
time,
no.
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
no,
we
were
not,
not
at
any
time.
i
might
say
that
the
attorney
general's
committee,
a
national
committee
on
the
study
of
the
antitrust
laws
is
quoted
at
page
34
of
our
brief
on
this
very
issue.
that
report
said,
the
grant-back
of
exclusive
licenses
should
be
subject
to
close
scrutiny
but
“on
the
other
hand,
grant-back
of
a
non-exclusive
license,
as
in
this
case,
especially
with
author
--
with
the
authority
to
sublicense
may
defuse
the
benefits
to
all
licensees
and
thus
tend
to
encourage
competitive
use
of
the
innovations."
mr.
elbert
r.
gilliom
well
of
course,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
is
always
implicit
in
this
arrangement,
a
patent
monopoly
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
in
--
in
a
license
agreement
that
these
license-back
clauses
appear,
so
that
would
always
be
the
case.
i
think
the
point
is
that
rather
than
permitting
someone
simply
to
sit-on
an
improvement,
this
type
of
thing
results
in
its
being
used
by
more
people.
i
want
to
go
briefly
to
the
fourth
question
which
is
raised
by
the
petition
and
that
is
the
alleged
fraud
in
the
procurement
of
these
ransburg
patents.
reliance
is
placed
on
two
affidavits
that
were
filed
to
the
patent
office
in
march
1953.
in
those
affidavits
which
were
for
the
purpose
of
showing
the
commercial
success
of
the
inventions
as
ransburg
had
commercialized
them
in
the
number
due
process,
the
petitioner
says
that
it
was
misrepresented
that
these
commercial
systems
use
stationary
heads.
if
the
court
will
examine
the
haworth
in
his
big
affidavits
which
were
in
record
4,
pages
637
to
642.
it
will
be
found
that
there
was
no
such
representation.
the
affidavits
referred
to
the
number
two
system.
the
number
two
system
at
that
time
in
1953
was
well-known
to
industry.
the
brochures
describing
these
rotating
heads
had
been
distributed
at
the
rate
of
some
10,000
a
year
and
the
patent
office
itself
had
received
a
copy
of
that
brochure
which
is
exhibit
iiii
in
this
case,
a
year
and
a
half
before
this
occurred.
so
that
not
only
was
it
proper
to
furnish
this
--
these
affidavits
but
no
one
was
misled.
the
inventions
of
these
patents
were
not
limited
to
stationary
heads.
the
claims
were
broader
than
that
and
fully
encompassed,
the
commercial
systems
as
ransburg
marketing
co.
(ph).
that
was
found
by
both
of
the
courts
below.
in
conclusion,
if
the
court
please,
we
feel
that
in
marketing
its
processes,
ransburg
has
followed
the
rules
of
this
court
and
the
rules
of
the
statutes
assiduously
and
that
it
has
done
what
the
patent
system
and
that
congress
have
contemplated
be
--
be
done
when
you
have
a
--
an
invention
of
valued
industry.
in
other
words,
it
has
licensed
its
inventions
and
it
has
left
others
free
to
come
in
and
furnish
the
equipment
on
a
basis
which
is
comparable
to
its
own.
none
of
these
practices
gauged
separately,
is
unlawful
under
any
test
laid
down
by
this
curt
or
otherwise.
and
in
their
totality,
they
have
not
gone
beyond
what
the
legitimate
patent
monopoly
has
provided.
we
feel
that
the
ransburg
program
is
one
which
illustrates
the
legitimate
things
that
may
be
done
under
our
patent
laws
today
to
bring
a
significant
improvement
to
industry
which
is
small
manufacture
worked
out
in
solving
his
own
pinning
problems.
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
compete
aggressively
but
lawfully
with
binks
and
all
the
others
who
are
in
the
same
field.
and
he
is
willing
to
issue
licenses
to
anyone
to
use
the
process
and
they
can
get
their
equipment
anywhere
they
wish.
they
are
not
forced
to
take
anything
in
order
to
get
those
licenses.
if
the
court
please,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
