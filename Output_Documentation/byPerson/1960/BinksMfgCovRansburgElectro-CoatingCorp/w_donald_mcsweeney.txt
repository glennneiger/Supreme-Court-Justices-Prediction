mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
mr.
chief
justice.
before
proceeding
with
my
argument,
i'd
respectfully
ask
leave
of
this
court
for
permission
to
file
a
reply
brief
herein,
no
later
than
tomorrow.
we
received
the
answering
brief
of
the
respondents
only
this
past
saturday
in
chicago.
we've
made
arrangements
to
print
it
overnight
and
i
will
make
every
effort
to
give
the
typewritten
copy
to
my
opponent
this
evening.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
is
an
antitrust
case
and
involves
also
the
misuse
of
patents.
with
the
additional
point
urged
in
part
5
of
our
brief
that
respondent
fraudulently
procured
the
starkey
patents.
that
0.5
will
be
handled
in
this
oral
argument
by
mr.
meroni.
i
will
confine
myself
to
the
first
four
points
of
our
brief.
the
issues
which
i
shall
discuss
are
a
matter
of
the
restraint
of
trade
and
monopoly
which
we
say
the
totality
of
the
conduct
of
this
respondent
has
brought
about
and
it
has
achieved
a
monopoly
position
today
in
the
field
of
airless
electrostatic
spraying
and
painting.
secondly,
and
we
say
additionally
and
standing
alone,
its
practices
of
tying
in
equipment
leases
with
patent
licenses
are
illegal.
and
we
say
also
that
it
is
engaged
in
a
program
of
compulsory
package
licensing
of
patents
which
standing
alone
is
illegal.
and
that
it
has
violated
the
laws
because
of
its
dominant
position
and
its
position
holding
basic
patent
of
requiring
in
its
patent
license
agreements
grant-back
clauses
of
future
inventions.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor,
i
think
there
were
erroneous
legal
tests
applied
here.
i
think
i
shall
demonstrate
or
even
from
construing
the
agreements,
you'll
find
for
example
with
respect
to
the
tie-in
argument
that
?
that
the
agreement,
the
so
called
alternative
agreement
of
theirs
compelled
a
prospective
licensee
to
go
back
to
ransburg,
the
respondent
to
get
equipment.
the
petitioner,
binks
--
binks
manufacturing
company
commenced
this
action
by
filing
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
it
was
there
or
it's
been
a
--
and
that
was
in
1946
--
in
1956,
october.
there
was
a
counterclaim
filed
by
a
respondent,
ransburg,
beyond
alleging
infringement
of
the
starkey
method
patent.
binks,
the
petitioner,
denied
infringement
alleged
invalidity
and
misuse
of
the
patent
and
charged
violations
of
the
sherman
and
clayton
acts.
the
--
later,
when
the
starkey
apparatus
patent
issued
in
june
of
1957,
it
was
brought
in
to
the
lawsuit
in
may
of
1958.
the
district
court
found
in
favor
of
the
respondent
ransburg,
on
all
issues.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
except
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
allowing
ransburg
attorney's
fees
and
the
matter
of
attorney's
fees
is
not
here
before
this
court,
matter
of
ransburg's
attorney's
fees.
now,
the
respondent
ransburg
is
in
the
business
of
leasing
equipment
used
in
electrostatic
spray
coating
or
painting.
there
are,
and
we
shall
be
discussing,
two
different
painting
processes
which
the
respondent
leads
us.
first,
which
is
called
the
number
one
process
and
then
later
commencing
in
1951,
they
began
marketing
their
number
two
process.
the
number
two
---
number
one
process
which
they
commenced
marketing
in
19
--
approximately
1944,
consists
basically
in
employing
an
electrostatic
field
for
depositing
liquid
particles
delivered
or
sprayed
into
the
field
by
a
conventional
air
spray
gun.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
the
number
one
process
is
before
us
in
--
insofar
as
it's
part
of
the
buildup
of
this
monopoly
position
of
their
--
the
respondent,
there's
no
--
it's
before
us
in
that
respect.
we
alleged
that
by
the
position
they
attained
in
marketing
the
number
one
process,
they
got
?
they
got
a
dominant
position
there
and
the
impetus
from
that
gave
them
the
dominant
position
immediately
upon
marketing
the
airless
process
in
1951,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
number
two
process,
a
rotating
or
centrifugal
bell
or
disk
is
substituted
for
the
air
gun
of
the
number
one
process.
the
number
two
process
commonly
referred
to
as
the
airless
process
has
no
spray
gun
used
in
it.
now,
respondent's
marketing
program,
since
respondent
began
licensing
its
electrostatic
spray
coating
process
in
1944,
it
has
combined
a
patent
licensing
and
an
equipment
leasing
arrangement.
the
respondent
never
sells
this
equipment.
it
always
leases
it.
and
it
charges
an
initial
fee
ranging
from
$5000
to
$40,000
depending
upon
the
size
and
type
of
the
installation.
and
then
in
addition,
either
a
minimum
monthly
fee
or
a
percentage
of
the
cost
of
the
coating
material
which
passes
through
the
process
whichever
those
monthly
fees
is
higher.
as
of
the
time
of
the
filing
of
this
case,
the
respondent
is
granted
733
electrostatic
coating
licenses.
now
that
includes
airless
and
with
air.
and
there
463
still
in
enforced,
it
had
granted
some
337
airless
licenses
of
which
beginning
of
this
suit,
there
272
still
enforced
in
effect.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
that's
--
that's
the
contention
we
make,
your
honor
that
you
cannot.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
findings
are
that
the
that
they
did
not
require,
that
ransburg
did
not
require
as
a
condition
of
getting
a
patent
license,
the
taking
of
respondent's
equipment.
but
we
or
i
shall
argue
and
i
--
our
brief
doesn't
--
i
think
we
can
demonstrate
that
the
so-called
alternative
agreement
which
they've
printed
and
stopped
commencing
in
1953,
really
gave
no
choice.
and
i'm
going
to
come
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
court,
however,
didn't
construe,
did
improperly
construe
this
--
this
agreement
if
the
court
please
and
it's
an
agreement
the
--
as
a
matter
of
contract
law,
i
believe
that
this
court
can
conclude
that
that
agreement
has
--
requires
the
potential
or
prospective
licensee
to
come
to
ransburg
for
the
equipment
and
that
there
was
no
freedom
of
choice
there.
and
the
agreement
which
i'm
going
to
discuss
in
a
little
detail,
planned
to,
is
set
forth
in
the
record
volume
3
at
page
31.
it's
in
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
combination
apparatus.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
and
there's
an
exhibit
where
we
list
those
--
even
things
like
hoses,
pliers
and
that
type
of
common
ordinary
--
in
volume
1
page
182,
there's
a
list,
a
typical
list
of
those
parts.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
you
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
you
don't
have
to
utilize
them
i
suppose,
your
honor,
but
you
have
to
pay
for
them
in
the
first
place.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
you
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
now
in
addition
to
these
agreements.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
the
respondent
was
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
it's
physically
possible,
your
honor,
to
get
them
there.
their
sachets
would
be
in
a
hardware
store,
i
suppose
i
might
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
you
have
to
--
yes
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
you
pay
in
advance.
when
you
first
get
the
license,
you
pay
a
fee
which
includes
an
amount
which
takes
care
of
the
replacement
parts
and
the
services.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
it
is
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
1953,
respondent
printed
and
stopped
a
so-called
alternative
agreement,
which
did
not
have
in
it,
a
provision
expressly
saying,
this
you
take
our
equipment.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
it
never
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
it
does
require
payment
for
non-patentable
parts.
whenever
you
take
any
equipment
from
them,
you
always
take
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
say
you
must,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
that.
there's
a
big
argument
in
this
lawsuit
over
that
very
point.
the
question
is
under
this
alternative
so-called
alternative
agreement,
does
it
compel
you
--
does
it
drive
you
back
to
ransburg
for
your
equipment?
you
will
note
that
it
--
it
talks
about
it
--
it
says,
you
get
--
you
you
are
--
have
the
right
to
use
a
system
as
prescribed
in
the
ransburg
drawings,
subject
to
such
changes
and
specifications
as
ransburg
may
make.
that
i
say,
gives
ransburg
the
power.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
on
page
--
volume
3,
page
18,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
oh,
excuse
me.
the
one
i
referred
to
before
was
on
page
--
commencing
on
page
31.
that's
exhibit
d,
runs
for
about
till
page
36.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
on
page
32,
your
honor,
paragraph
numbered
1,
where
it
says
license.
and
the
last
part
--
sentence
--
last
part
of
that
paragraph,
it
says,
you
have
these
licenses
--
to
use
said
process
as
shown
in
ransburg
volume
number
blank,
subject
to
such
changes
therein
and
such
further
specifications
as
ransburg
may
prescribe.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
take
it
they
did
not,
your
honor
or
they
never
could've
arrived
at
the
result
i'm
suggesting
here.
this
this
--
i
want
to
say
at
this
time
since
we've
got
into
this
a
little
--
i
think
at
preliminary,
we
must
make
clear
is
that,
there's
no
practice
to
go
by
under
this
agreement.
they
never
put
this
contract
into
effect,
ransburg
says
no
one
wanted.
there's
no
--
we
don't
know
what
in
fact
they
actually
did
with
this
contract.
we
know
that
this
is
the
contract
which
they
said,
"here
is
the
alternative.
if
you
don't
want
our
equipment,
sign
this
contract."
i
say
that
this
contract
drives
your
right
back
to
ransburg
for
the
equipment.
it's
the
power
they
retained
if
you
signed
this
contract
which
is
the
vicious
thing,
which
makes
the
tie-in
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
say
that
with
finding
66,
the
district
court
just
misconstrued
or
ignored
the
agreement
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
know
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i'm
asking
you
to
interpret
a
contract,
a
written
contract
which
is
before
this
court.
and
you
will
then
overturn
that
finding,
i
--
i
believe.
in
that
respect
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
it
is
flatly
contrary,
but
i
don't
believe
it
involves
your
overturning
it,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
involves
your
determining
any
basic
facts.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
you
can
overturn
it.
i
think
it's
just
a
conclusion.
and
they've
wrongly
--
that
court
has
wrongly
applied
a
rule
of
law
in
a
--
a
legal
construction
of
a
written
contract.
and
this
court,
i
submit,
is
as
--
in
a
--
an
eligible
position
as
--
able
a
position
to
construe
that
contract
and
to
construe
it,
in
a
way
i
suggest,
which
will
in
effect,
overturn
that
finding.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
the
other
evidence,
yes,
your
honor
that
that
--
what
was
it
done
in
practice
is
in
other
evidence.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
because
this
agreement
was
never
put
into
effect.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
they're
separate
--
those
are
separate
matters,
your
honor,
because
under
this
contract,
this
contract
which
i've
referred
to
was
never
executed.
no
one
ever
took
it.
this
is
the
contract
that
ransburg
said,
if
you
don't
want
equipment,
take
this
alternate
contract.
so
everybody
who
took
that
contract,
took
the
contract
which
had
the
equipment
provision
in
it.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
oh,
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
in
that
respect,
you
do.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
i
--
the
other
evidence
shows
that
this
was
never
used.
this
contract
was
never
accepted.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
not
that
he
ever
called
it
that.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
that
--
i
--
it's
true
the
district
court
found
that
as
a
requirement,
it
never
was
a
requirement.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
oh,
my
claim
is
that
even
had
they
taken
this
alternative
form
of
contract,
they
would
have,
by
the
expressed
terms
of
this
so-called
alternative
contract,
been
driven
to
ransburg,
to
take
the
equipment.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
they
there's
they
don't
--
the
district
court
didn't
make
any
finding
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
don't
recall.
i
don't
know
if
we
asked
for
one.
i
didn't
get
one.
in
continuing
with
respect
to
certain
of
the
facts
which
i
think
are
to
remain
to
my
argument,
i
want
to
mention
that
in
1951,
when
the
respondent
began
licensing
its
number
two
process,
it
inserted
in
its
agreements,
in
all
of
its
agreements
with
respect
to
the
airless,
the
number
two
system,
a
provision
for
grant-back
--
for
the
grant-back
of
any
inventions,
improvements
or
patents,
domestic
or
foreign,
from
any
source
relating
to
methods
or
apparatus
involving
this
airless
electrostatic
spray
coating.
and
this
grant-back
was
not
restricted
to
improvements
upon
the
apparatus
being
licensed
and
in
the
extent
that
during
the
term
of
the
agreement
and
for
two
years,
thereafter.
now,
it's
true
in
1945,
respondent
used
a
type
of
contract
which
didn't
have
the
grant-back
provision
in
it,
but
it
did
not
at
that
time,
cancel
the
outstanding
agreements
containing
grant
back.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
there
were
133
which
remained
in
effsect,
full
force
and
effect
through
the
--
this
lawsuit
and
through
the
closing
of
proof
and
through
the
time
the
findings
were
added.
i
noted
in
respondent's
brief
the
--
it
goes
outside
the
record
to
say
they've
been
eliminated
in
sometime
in
1959.
well
that
would
have
been
after
these
findings
were
entered.
if
they
were,
it's
not
in
the
record,
and
if
they
were,
i
suggest
it's
too
late,
as
far
as
it's
no
purge
to
do
it
at
that
time.
in
19
--
prior
to
1953,
this
form,
this
so-called
alternative
form,
which
supposedly
didn't
require
the
licensing
of
equipment,
had
never
been
in
existence.
but
in
1953
was
the
first
time
they
printed
and
stocked
such
a
form.
and
that
time,
they
sent
letters
to
their
existing
licensees,
asked
him
if
they'd
want
to
take
that
kind
of
equipment.
now,
these
existing
licensees
already
had
taken
equipment
from
ransburg
and
they
had
paid
large
sums
for
it.
they
--
they
would
have
had
to
under
the
terms
of
this
proposal
--
they
would've
had
to
return
that
equipment,
but
they
wouldn't
get
a
refund
of
their
money.
of
course,
none
of
them
took
advantage
of
that
so-called
offer.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
it
was
not
enough
to
purge
and
i
mentioned
that
the
united
states
government
has
filed
in
an
amicus
memorandum
here
on
that
point
and
on
the
point
with
respect
to
the
--
that
is
that
they
didn't
do
enough
to
purge
and
on
the
?
on
the
point
with
respect
to
grant
that
clauses.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
one
the
one
is
not
based
on
any
fact
in
the
record,
as
far
as
--
i
would
have
two
answers
to
that
with
respect
to
this
--
that
it
was
not
available
on
the
open
market.
secondly,
if
there
was
a
tie-in
--
if
it
was
a
condition,
the
availability
on
the
open
market
on
lack
of
availability
doesn't
matter.
that
--
if
it
was
--
it
had
some
intrinsic
value.
over
and
above
that
of
competitors,
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
tie
it
in.
the
question
i
think
is
whether
they
tied
it
in.
this
--
the
petitioner
here
has
for
many
years,
been
in
the
spray
painting
supply
business
and
it
sells
spray
guns
and
allied
equipment.
and
it
developed
a
simple
electrostatic
liquid
spraying
device
or
emitter.
and
it
was
capable
as
its
president
testified,
"i'm
ready
to
supply
equipment
for
an
electrostatic
spray
coating
system
on
order."
and
it
had
interested
a
prospective
customer
in
buying
this.
so
the
petitioner
was
if
it
could
have
gotten
into
this
market,
it
was
ready,
willing
and
able
to
supply
equipment.
we
contend
that's
where
our
injury
is.
if
--
if
there
hadn't
been
a
tie-in,
we
would
have
been
able
to
sell
our
equipment.
and
that's
where
this
conduct
impinged
upon
us
and
that's
why
we
were
injured
under
the
antitrust
laws.
we're
also
urging
here
in
the
misuse
of
patents.
we
contend
that
the
first,
that
the
totality
of
this
conduct
gave
the
respondent
a
monopoly
position
and
it
constituted
a
restraint
of
trade.
and
that
monopoly
position
which
it
had
had
because
it
was
the
only
supplier
of
this
equipment
in
the
market
and
that's
admitted
and
there
was
no
other
supplier
of
replacement
parts
or
no
other
service
organization
when
this
company
went
into
marketing
of
its
number
two
process
in
1951.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
evidence
shows
that
they
asked
us
to
make
something
for
them
in
1944.
i
believe,
the
president
of
our
company
testified
and
didn't
or
couldn't
at
that
time
or
didn't
want
to
make
one
of
these
items
for
a
voltage
pen
in
1944.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
unsupported
in
the
record,
your
honor.
that's
not
mine.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
correct.
now,
the
amount
these
--
these
licensing
fees
consisted
--
amounted
to
some
on
the
number
two
airless
system
in
1956,
the
amount
of
this
--
something
over
$2,200,000.
and
the
total
amount
of
these
fees
for
the
period
of
1951
to
1957
was
over
$8,000,000.
ransburg
said
in
his
brief
--
or
said
they
admitted
it
had
some
$2,250,000
invested
in
at
leased
equipment,
figured
on
a
cost
basis.
i'm
going
to
pass
a
common
--
we
have
--
write
out
in
our
brief
at
pages
7
to
9
and
he
pranks
the
various
activities
of
the
respondent
in
acquiring
when
it
embarked
upon
this
licensing
program
of
acquiring
patents
from
others.
and
acquiring
those
patents
on
a
non-exclusive
basis
for
the
right
to
sublicense,
which
we
say
should
--
well,
excuse
me,
they
are
on
exclusive
basis,
where
the
--
in
their
field
were
the
right
to
sublicense,
which
was
we
contend
for
the
purpose
of
monopolizing
this
field.
it
didn't
just
take
a
non-exclusive
license.
in
each
instance,
they
got
an
exclusive
license.
now,
we
say
that
our
injury
is
that
because
of
the
totality
of
the
conduct
of
respondent
we,
binks,
are
unable
to
market
our
equipment
in
the
airless
electrostatic
field.
now,
specifically
with
respect
to
this
time,
i
say
it
with
--
in
every
instance
under
the
number
two
airless
system
and
every
instance
where
they
actually
leased
it,
a
respondent
joined
a
patent
license
with
an
equipment
lease.
the
practice
under
the
number
one
system
prior
thereto
had
been
substantially
the
same.
a
few
licenses
that
were
without
leases,
one
was
in
a
settlement
of
a
lawsuit,
the
others
were
with
a
few
licensees
who
had
previously
taken
their
equipment
for
use
in
another
system.
prior
to
1953,
then
the
only
form
--
the
standard
form
had
in
it
a
paragraph
on
equipment
leasing.
there
were
in
the
company,
certain
internal
memoranda
saying,
if
the
--
we
have
a
policy
of
making
available
patent
licenses
without
leases.
these
were
distributed
just
to
their
own
salespeople
and
to
the
distributors.
but
at
the
same
time,
they
were
outstanding,
these
brochures
which
we've
referred
in
our
brief
and
that
are
in
the
record,
volume
2
at
pages
854
and
862
was
given.
the
emphasis
has
placed
upon
the
equipment.
the
trade
gets
the
idea
if
it
does
business
with
ransburg,
it
must
take
its
equipment.
now,
in
1953
and
the
ransburg
makes
a
big
point
of
this,
it
changed
its
policy.
we
called
it
in
our
brief
an
attempt
to
purge.
at
that
time,
guess
what
did
it
would
do?
well,
it
wrote
to
the
existing
licensees.
all
of
whom
had
license
--
licenses
with
leases
and
said,
"you
can
go
to
another
--
this
other
form
without
equipment."
the
other
form
now
was
this
form
which
i
contend,
didn't
give
them
that
free
choice.
now,
these
licensees
had
no
reason
in
--
in
the
world
to
do
that
because
they'd
already
in
effect,
paid
for
the
equipment.
they
wouldn't
have
to
return
their
equipment
without
a
refund
of
money.
at
that
time,
for
the
first
time
and
since
after
1953,
respondent,
ransburg,
prepared
a
pricing
schedule
which
would
give
the
necessary
information
to
one
of
its
salesmen
to
price
out
a
license
without
equipment.
and
it
did
tally
salespeople
to
advise
perspective
licensees
that
they
had
this
alternative
agreement.
however,
no
one
ever
took
it.
now,
this
alternative
agreement
in
page
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
the
practice
which
they
pursued
here
was
illegal
because
in
the
setting
of
this
case,
they
always
licensed
only
with
equipment
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
with
equipment
lease.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
no,
the
other
choice
i
say
was
no
alternative,
your
honor.
it
forced
them
to
ransburg
equipment.
that
--
that
agreement
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
it
was
--
it
was
academic
--
well,
i
say
your
honor
to
that
that
this
--
not
this
--
this
so-called
alternative
agreement
didn't
really
give
you
any
choice.
it
says
in
the
agreement,
if
i
may
refer
again
to
volume
3,
page
32,
it's
argued
--
you'd
get
--
you
get
a
license
and
you
may
use
it
as
shown
in
ransburg's
drawing.
they
draw
and
then
they
have
the
power
to
make
a
drawing.
they
can
draw
in
--
they
can
make
a
drawing
which
is
ransburg's
equipment
and
only
its
equipment.
for
example,
it
could
draw
in
the
patented
apparatus
on
the
starkey
--
enact
that
apparatus
patented.
you'd
have
to
come
to
ransburg
to
get
it.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
finding
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
they
do
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
right.
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
we
never
had
--
we
asked
for
a
lot
of
findings.
none
of
them
were.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
don't
have
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
don't
know
that
we
did.
i
don't
know.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
there
is
none.
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
starting
in
1953,
they
had
two
forms
of
contract.
one,
without
the
paragraph
for
equipment
which
is
this
agreement
which
i
refer
to
at
the
record
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
the
other
is
a
contract
with
a
paragraph
specially
--
specifying
you
take
equipment.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
think
that
that
is
true
and
i'm
arguing
that,
but
i'm
arguing
additionally,
your
honor
that
there
was
no
real
alternative.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
the
findings
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
other
way
--
the
findings,
the
other
way
are
based
upon
the
existence
of
this
so-called
alternative
agreement.
so
if
this
alternative
agreement
is
not
really
an
alternative,
the
findings
are
clearly
wrong.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
the
evidence
is
that
these
are
the
only
forms
available.
when
they
sent
two
forms,
they
only
let
this
out
of
their
company
on
two
instances.
they
sent
two
forms
to
binks,
petitioner.
here,
they
are
and
they
--
they
were
each
one
of
these
--
these
types.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
contend
you
can
gather
that,
your
honor,
from
reading
the
contract
itself.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
absolutely,
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
subject
to
such
changes
therein
and
such
further
specification
as
ransburg
may
prescribe
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
right,
your
honor.
well,
that
coupled
--
if
we
go
beyond
that,
to
any
practice,
i
say
that
shows
it
in
the
contract
itself.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i
don't
believe
that's
true,
your
honor.
they're
--
they're
giving
a
license
under
a
method
patent
here?
they
haven't
any
right
to
tie-in
parts
to
it.
as
i
understand
the
law
--
as
i
understand
the
b.b
chemical
against
ellis,
they
had
a
method
patent.
they
haven't
any
right
to
tie-in
parts.
the
method
patent
doesn't
patent
any
of
their
parts.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
then
they're
combining
--
then
they're
combining
two
licenses
under
a
compulsory
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
a
further
point
we
have
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well
that's
the
setting
of
this
case,
which
we
argue
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
the
facts
if
doesn't,
it's
clearly
wrong.
the
facts
show
that
ransburg
dominates
this
airless
electrostatic
spray
coating
industry.
that
it's
the
only
one
in
it.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
i'm
challenging
the
findings,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
it's
not
sustained
by
the
evidence,
but
i'm
adding
that
this
court
can
construe
this
contract
as
a
matter
of
law
and
rule
with
me.
there
was
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
there
was
considerable
and
the
practice
with
respect
to
what
kind
of
a
contract
they
ever
entered
into
is
all
one
way.
they
always
entered
into
a
contract
which
had
in
it
the
provision
for
leasing
equipment.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
right
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
existing
licensees
first
considered
them.
they
had
already
paid
a
lot
of
money
to
get
the
equipment.
if
they
took
as
the
letters
to
them
said,
they
had
to
return
the
equipment
to
ransburg,
but
not
get
a
refund.
that
alone
would
keep
them
from
taking
it.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
other,
i
believe
would
be
that
you
would
recognize
from
this
contract
that
your
--
your
so-called
alternative
contract
that
you
give
ransburg
the
power
to
come
out
and
change
the
drawing,
change
the
specifications
after
you've
got
someone
else's
equipment
in
there.
they
could
come
out
and
say,
"well
that
isn't
right.
that's
our
right
to
have
under
this.
here,
we're
changing
that."
so
you
can't
use
mr.
binks'
equipment.
it
doesn't
meet
this
drawing.
you've
got
to
--
you
want
to
use
our
patents,
you've
got
to
use
our
equipment.you've
got
to
use
equipment
that's
in
this
drawing.
they
could've
--
and
whether
they
drew
it
to
make
them
use
ransburg
patented
equipment
or
unpatented
equipment,
they
still
had
the
power
to
keep
the
licensee
from
using
the
equipment
of
anyone
else.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
that's
uncontested,
your
honor.
didn't
enter
a
find,
there's
no
contest
on
that.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
no
question,
but
that
is
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
well,
they
could've
paid
anywhere
from
$5000
to
$40,000
in
an
initial
fee,
plus
the
monthly
fee,
all
that
would
probably
--
if
they
were
a
big
customer,
it
wouldn't
--
they
wouldn't
be
under
the
minimum
monthly
fee.
they'd
be
paying
on
the
amount
of
paint
used.
could
--
they
couldn't
devise
post.
they
could
lose
over
well
anything
from
$40,000
up,
i
don't
know
how
much.
it
depends
on
who
it
was.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
mr.
chief
justice,
our
position
with
respect
to
tie
in
briefly
in
answer
to
mr.
gilliom.
first,
we
contend
that
the
agreement
which
i
discussed
yesterday
without
restrictive
language
is
the
sole
alternative.
but
we
contend
that
it
is
enough
for
illegality
that
the
respondent
had
the
method
of
doing
business
of
tie-in
its
equipment
all
the
time
and
for
that
proposition,
we
site
b.b.
chemical
against
ellis.
and
we
also
referred
--
would
stand
on
the
international
salt
case
in
this
court
where
your
--
where
this
court
said,
“the
tie-in
clause
has
not
been
insisted
upon
in
all
leases
nor
has
it
always
been
enforced
when
it
wasn't
included.”
now,
what
the
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
this
method
of
doing
business
which
your
honor
was
always
--
and
when
they
actually
did
business,
they
always
leased
the
equipment
in
conjunction
with
a
patent
license
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
and
they
can
sell
equipment,
or
either
they
leased
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
the
practice
of
doing
business,
your
honor,
this
way
and
only
this
way.
that
is
the
same
thing
that
we
had
in
the
b.b.-ellis
case.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
they
made
it
practically
necessary
from
--
and
also
they
made
it
necessary
from
the
agreements
which
they
offered
by
contract.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
practically
necessary.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
we
--
we
contend
there
was
no
desirability,
your
honor.
now,
with
respect
to
answering
whether
this
agreement
that
i
discussed
yesterday
was
the
sole
alternative,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
ransburg
sales
bulletin
volume
3,
page
315,
it's
dated
april
4,
1955.
it
tells
you
what
the
alternatives
are.
it
says
in
the
last
sentence,
“forms,
numbers,
so
and
so
and
so
and
so
in
437
--
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
--
our
--
our
current
forms."
315,
your
honor
of
volume
3.
and
then
that
letter
includes
as
enclosures
therein,
the
forms
that
it
includes
as
the
form
for
the
airless
without
so-called
without
equipment,
form
number
437
which
is
set
forth
as
part
of
the
same
exhibit
at
page
339
of
the
record.
now,
that's
their
own
sales
bulletin.
that's
the
thing
they
rely
on
for
saying
they
had
a
different
policy
that
that
they
rely
on
earlier
sales
bulletins.
here's
a
sales
bulletin
that
says,
“salesmen,
here
are
our
current
forms.”
and
that's
the
form
they
give
them,
the
same
restrictive
language
subject
to
such
further
specifications
as
ransburg
may
proscribe.
as
for
the
question
of
--
of
mr.
gilliom
about
active
discouragement,
there
was
active
discouragement
in
the
web
carr
correspondents
in
the
record,
volume
2,
page
823.
now,
is
anyone
else
making
this
equipment?
that
seems
to
be
a
--
a
point
of
mr.
gilliom
that
no
one
wants.
well,
that's
one
thing
this
lawsuit
is
about,
if
the
court
please.
binks
was
ready
to
produce
and
deliver
this
system,
not
only
just
the
pliers
for
example
but
the
whole
system,
the
whole
spokes
and
the
wheel,
the
whole
wheel.
they
could
deliver
it
on
order
and
they
couldn't
get
into
the
market
because
of
the
position
and
the
activities
and
the
practices
of
ransburg
with
respect
to
some
other
items
of
equipment
that
they
were
no
other
in
the
market
of
these
voltage
packs.
i
refer
the
court
to
volume
3,
page
283,
a
letter
of
ransburg
itself
to
its
own
people,
its
own
distributors.
we
have
noticed
they
say
in
august
18,
1950,
we
have
noticed
that
voltage
supplies
had
been
advertised
which
are
so
supposedly
suitable
for
electrostatic
painting.
then
they
warned
them
about
using
them,
“don't
use
them.”
on
package
licensing,
if
the
court
please,
there
is
a
finding
against
this
71
and
we
contend
that
finding
is
clearly
erroneous
and
this
is
the
reason.
we
say
it's
erroneous
because
this
court
has
to
construe
the
agreement,
the
agreements
which
they
enter
into
and
a
proper
construction
of
that
agreement
is
that
respondent
licensed
under
all
of
its
patents,
now,
this
phrase,
"pertaining
to
and
covering
methods
and
apparatus
used
in
airless
electrostatic
spray
coating."
now,
that
is
regardless
of
whether
those
patents
apply
to
the
particular
system
being
leased
or
not.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
donald
mcsweeney
no.
your
honor
--
yes
that's
true.
that's
in
a
letter
of
august
18,
1950.
i'm
referring
that
to
that
letter
to
show,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
was
a
potentially
competitive
voltage
pack
on
the
market.
i
referred
earlier
to
show
that
--
i
refer,
mr.
justice
black,
to
show
that
the
sole
alternative
available
for
the
airless
system
was
only
the
agreement
which
i
discussed
yesterday
with
that
restrictive
language.
and
for
that
point
your
honor,
i
referred
to
page
315
of
volume
3.
we
can
see,
we
--
the
record
shows
that
they
put
out
some
bulletins
to
their
salesmen
which
said
--
and
this
is
what
they
relied
and
they
put
out
those
bulletins
to
salesmen
saying,
"competitors
if
they
should
insist,
may
use
their
own
equipment."
now,
when
they
formed
and
printed
and
start
this
agreement
without
a
provision
for
equipment
in
1953,
then
that
agreement
was
the
only,
the
sole
alternative,
your
honor.
and
i
refer
to
record
page
315
for
that
where
they
say
that
forms
numbers
so
and
so
are
our
current
forms
in
the
event
any
licensees
desire
a
license
only.
then
when
you
see
what
the
enclosure
was,
form
437,
you
find
that
it
is
that
agreement
which
is
--
contains
as
i
contend
this
restrictive
language
which
drives
the
perspective
licensee
right
back
to
ransburg
to
get
his
equipment.
thank
you.
