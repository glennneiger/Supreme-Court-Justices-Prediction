you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
a
finding
on
that
first
point
that
you
made
mr.
mcsweeney
that
--
that
anyone
who
was
to
return
the
property,
had
to
return
it
without
a
refund
whether
he
had
had
--
they'd
had
only
acquired
at
great
expense,
and
that
it
would
be
to
their
injury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
not
question
on
that.
chief
justice

and
to
what
--
to
what
extent
would
they
be
insured
to

would

mr.
gilliom,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
many
outstanding
licenses
were
there
at
that
time,
mr.
gilliom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
many
--
and
how
many
since?
chief
justice
earl
warren
up
to
that
time,
was
there
--
was
there
any
testimony
on
the
part
of
anyone
that
he
was
required
to
--
to
take
the
non-patented
articles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
nothing
it
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
did
i
understand
you
that
there
--
there
were
no
other
manufacturers
manufacturing
these
parts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
wondering
if
the
provision
in
the
contract
on
the
grant-back
provisions
had
anything
to
do
with
the
reasonableness
of
that
letter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
only
on
sending
it
out
but
as
to
whether
it
was
affected
on
the
grant-back
provision,
they
were
bound
to
license
to
the
--
to
ransburg
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
without
any
royalty
of
any
kind,
every
invention
of
every
kind
that
they
made
concerning
this
process,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
if
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
business
and
they
were
producing
the
whole
thing,
in
any
inventions
that
--
that
were
made
by
any
of
their
--
their
licensees
which
where
all
of
the
people
using
that
in
the
country.
wouldn't
that
have
--
have
in
effect
upon
whether
--
whether
the
--
the
contract
to
let
them
buy
their
parts
any
place
they
wanted
was
effective?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
--
you
do
it
in
your
own
time
please.
don't
--
don't
go
at
it
now.
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
in
your
own
--
in
your
own
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
were
a
part,
they
became
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
entire
product,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
well,
doesn't
that
principle
dependent
upon
whether
--
whether
there's
a
monopoly
position
maintained
by
the
parties
or
not?
