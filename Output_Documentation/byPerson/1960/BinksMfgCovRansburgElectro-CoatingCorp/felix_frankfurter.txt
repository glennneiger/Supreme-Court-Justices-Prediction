justice

are
they
conditioned
upon
the
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
license
conditioned
upon
utilizing
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
you
have
to
pay
for
them
you
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
get
--
you
don't
get
the
patent?
you
don't
get
the
license,
if
you
don't
pay
for
those
fees?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
--
my
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
whether
the
grant
of
a
license
was
conditioned
upon
buying
these
things
or
paying
for
these
things.
i
got
your
distinction,
but
it's
thrown
away
after
you
buy
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
have
to
pay
for
these
things
from
the
licensor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
just
answer
the
contrary
to
justice
whittaker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
the
answer
to
my
question
whether
buying
for
these
non-patented
bought
parts,
is
a
condition
to
the
getting
the
license,
the
answer
is
yes,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
decree
that
we're
reviewing,
if
we're
asked
to
review
here,
is
the
decree
based
on
a
licensing
system
which
requires
payment
for
non-patentable
parts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
must
you
take
the
equipment
from
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
have
misconceived
your
answer
because
i
got
from
your
answer
when
you
said
the
power
they
have
drives
you
back
the
compulsory
paying
for
this
non-patentable
things.
the
questions
of
power
and
question
for
construction
of
an
agreement
which
in
the
power
means
de
facto
exercise
of
coercive
influence
and
that
i
should
think,
is
in
the
realm
of
evidence,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
therefore
the
--
to
pursue
justice
harlan's
question,
therefore
that
finding
i
don't
know
its
number,
partly
rests
on
reading
a
document,
but
also
rests
on
the
whole
evidence
as
to
what
was
done
under
it,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
mcsweeney,
one
can't
gather
from
reading
a
document
that
it
was
never
enforced
and
can't
get
that
from
a
piece
of
paper.
that
must
come
from
surrounding
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
fair.
i'm
not
suggesting
it
isn't
fair.
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
it.
i'm
suggesting
that
we
do
have
to,
as
justice
harlan
has
been
pressing
you.
we
do
have
to
go
into
the
evidence
since
i'm
--
we've
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
challenge
the
findings
but
i
can't
i
cannot
understand
that
we're
not
to
challenge
finding,
is
it,
for
the
66,
which
on
its
face
doesn't
give
the
conclusion
from
which
you
for
which
you
argued.
and
of
course,
you
have
to
go
outside
of
that
finding
to
find
that
which
appeared
on
paper
or
the
sham.
that's
your
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
don't
prove
sham
merely
by
reading
a
piece
of
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
the
judge
find
--
so
find
on
that
other
evidence?
did
the
district
court
make
findings
that
this
contract
on
which
it
relied
in
66
was
a
functus,
was
a
fiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
argued,
at
least
i
understood
you
to
contend
that
the
second
alternative
wasn't
chosen
and
in
fact
not
a
true
alternative,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that,
could
one
gather
that
merely
from
reading
the
alternative
--
the
piece
of
paper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
face
of
it,
that
shows
that
that
is
no
alternative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
is
so
only
if
the
specifications
which
they
require
were
specifications
for
non-patentable
parts.
if
they
were
for
patentable
parts,
then
they
were
there
within
their
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
part
--
patent
may
have
patented.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
point?
i
thought
your
point
earlier
was
that
there
--
it
required
them
to
pay
for
non-patentable
facilities,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
as
to
that,
one
cannot
get
that
from
merely
reading
the
contract
can
we?
if
they
leave
--
unless
they
have
such
coercive
monopolistic
power,
that
there
is
no
choice,
hobson's
choice,
i
guess
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
maybe,
but
--
but
the
--
the
finding
doesn't
--
finding
--
the
finding
to
which
you
refer
doesn't
establish
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
some
reason,
you've
declined
to
answer
justice
harlan's
question
that
you're
not
challenging
the
findings
as
not
sustained
by
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
no
--
no
one
had
shown
any
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
non-equipment
license
was
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
known
to
be
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
there
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
any
evidence
to
bearing
on
justice
black's
question.
is
there
any
evidence
that
there
would
be
the
active
discouragement
or
that
your
equipment
were
forced
upon
respective
licenses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
--
were
there
--
was
there
any
witness
or
witnesses
produced
by
binks
who
testified
that
they
couldn't
get
a
license
from
ransburg,
unless
they
also
bought
a
paper,
the
things
on
that
list.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
witness
by
--
produced
by
binks
or
offered
by
binks
of
purchases
who
signed
the
equipment,
the
facilities
that
you
furnished
for
getting
the
license
who
testified
he
had
to
take
those
facilities
or
not
get
the
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
occasion
for
that
emphasis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
date
of
this?
19
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
start
to
say
it
was
growing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
wondering
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
recall
at
the
moment.
was
there
a
decision
of
this
court
that
--
that
naturally
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
make
picking
more
lively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible),
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
decisions
or
cases
here
dealing
with
that
was
earlier
than
1953.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
price?
the
normal
price
of
the
equipment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
a
conventional
price?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
were
all
custom-made,
i
gather?
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
elucidate
the
question
put
by
justice
black,
do
you
understand
that
although
the
facility
or
the
equipment
which
you
furnished
or
ready
to
furnish
in
which
the
licensees
took.
although
it
contained
some
common
place
parts
but
if
they
wanted
your
equipment,
you
put
the
whole
thing
together.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
while
they
made
the
conventional
things
that
you
could
get
in
every
hardware
store,
the
totality
for
not
something
you
could
get
in
the
department
store.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
you
put
it
together,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
even
these
common
placed
parts
were
not
disjointedly
sold,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
repeat
my
words.
in
answer
to
my
question,
i
asked
you
whether
any
of
these
common
placed
parts
that
you
could
buy
at
(inaudible)
where
ever
that
old
term
in
new
york
is.
you
could
buy
anywhere.
were
they
disjointed
it
from
the
equipment?
and
you
said
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
wheel,
they
were
in
the
wheel
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
to
repeat
your
phrase,
“had
the
method
of
doing
business?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
mean
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
made
it
available
or
they
made
it
a
condition
of
getting
the
license,
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
practice
flow
from
them,
if
they
--
did
they
--
as
a
matter
of
a
conclusion
to
be
derived
from
evidence,
did
they
make
it
practically
necessary
to
utilize
there,
what
you
call
method
of
doing
business
or
did
people
of
their
volition
say,
“we
want
it
done
like
this.”
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
unders
--
understand
that
the
agreements
said
so,
that
we
can
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
other
thing,
i
should
think
is
very
important
to
differentiate
between
some
compulsion
in
the
practicalities
of
the
situation
on
the
part
of
the
patent
owner
--
owner
or
desirability
on
those
--
on
the
part
of
those
who
want
to
avail
themselves
of
it.
those
are
very
different
things.
