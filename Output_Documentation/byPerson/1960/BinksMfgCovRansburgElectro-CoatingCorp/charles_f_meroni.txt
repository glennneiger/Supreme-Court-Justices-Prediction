mr.
charles
f.
meroni
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please,
this
phase
of
the
argument
pertains
to
part
5
of
our
brief.
to
be
valid
and
enforceable,
a
patent
must
claim
from
a
background
free
of
thought
or
inequitable
conduct.
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
keystone,
hazel-atlas
and
the
precision
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
here,
the
respondent
procured
the
allowance
of
its
patents
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
showing
commercial
success
of
the
number
two
system.
but
the
affidavits
neglected
to
point
out
that
the
number
two
system
did
not
embody
what
was
alleged
to
be
the
heart
of
the
starkey
invention.
we
say
it
was
those
omissions
in
the
affidavits
that
constituted
the
perpetration
of
a
fraud
on
the
patent
laws.
though,
i
might
say
that
in
that
regard,
that
the
only
finding
that
i've
been
able
to
locate
pertaining
to
this,
is
finding
91
of
the
findings
here
and
they
were
all
proposed
by
the
defendant
for
the
most
part
and
adopted
by
the
court.
and
that
appears
at
page
1013.
in
that
finding,
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
willful
representations
of
the
patent
office
or
withheld
from
the
patent
office
knowledge
of
a
pertinent
prior
right.
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
point,
which
has
to
do
with
the
withholding
or
concealment
of
evidence
as
to
what
the
true
character
of
the
number
two
system
was.
in
the
affidavits
that
were
filed,
the
party
starkey
or
the
respondent,
failed
to
disclose
what
that
system
was.
now,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
these
applications
particularly
the
method
case,
was
pending
over
10
years.
it
was
filed
on
september
29th,
1944
and
it
wasn't
though
issued
until
august
3rd,
1954.
during
that
period
of
time,
there
were
repeated
rejections
both
by
the
examining
staff
and
by
the
board
of
appeals.
in
the
course
of
their
representations,
the
applicants
who
were
starkey
and
ransburg
said
to
the
patent
office,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
55
of
my
brief
a
short
sentence,
the
heart
of
applicant's
invention
lies
in
the
concept
of
employing
a
single
electrostatic
field
which
acts
as
the
soul
agent
to
atomize
paint,
disperse
the
particles
formed
by
atomization
and
deposit
those
particles
on
the
work.
that
statement
was
repeated
constantly
and
dr.
miller
also
admitted,
as
pointed
out
on
the
same
page
of
our
brief,
that
the
thing
that
was
considered
new
when
he
recorded
the
starkey
idea
was
the
concept
of
using
electrostatic
forces
alone
to
atomize,
disperse
and
deposit
these
materials.
in
other
words,
they
--
they
believe
it
to
be
new,
to
use
the
field
by
itself,
apart
from
anything
else,
as
the
atomizing
and
dispersing
and
coding
medium.
now,
there's
no
question
here,
there's
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
none
of
the
structures
shown
on
the
starkey
patents
and
incidentally,
the
drawings
of
the
two
patents
are
identical.
one
is
an
apparatus
patent
that
was
divided
out
arbitrarily
from
the
method
patent
without
any
requirement
of
division
by
the
patent
office.
so
that
the
history
of
the
apparent
case
which
is
the
method
case
also
carries
over
to
the
apparatus
case,
it
being
a
true
division.
now,
there's
no
question
that
none
of
the
structure
shown
in
those
patents
were
ever
commercialized.
that's
unequivocally
admitted
by
the
respondent
and
that
with
respect,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
for
volume
1,
page
199,
request
for
admission
30.
does
defendant
admit
that
it
never
commercialized
by
sale
or
lease,
any
electrostatic
sprayer
apparatus
of
the
structure
shown
in
--
in
anyone
of
the
figures
of
either
of
its
earlier
process
patent
number
or
it's
later
apparatus
patent
number?
and
the
answer
was,
yes.
now,
for
some
eight
years
after
the
starkey
application
was
allowed
or
was
filed,
only
one
narrow
claim
was
allowed.
in
19
--
in
1949,
the
pew
patent
expired,
that
was
the
patent
that
the
respondent
acquired
from
western
electric
company
and
which
covered
the
number
one
system.
also
at
that
time,
the
respondent
brought
forth
this
number
two
system,
making
use
of
both
a
centriphical
means
and
a
field
to
affect
atomization
and
spray.
now,
our
position,
your
honor,
as
to
that
point
and
which
we
believe
is
very
critical
to
this
case
is
shown
on
page
349
to
351
of
volume
1,
beginning
at
the
middle
of
the
page
at
552
and
ending
in
the
middle
of
page
351.
there
it
--
there,
it
is
conclusively
shown
that
the
number
two
system
did
not
depend
on
the
field
alone
for
atomization,
dispersion
and
deposition.
mr.
charles
f.
meroni
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
they
fail
--
the
respondent
failed
to
tell
the
patent
office
that
the
number
two
system
did
--
did
not
accomplish
coating
by
the
use
of
the
field
alone.
mr.
charles
f.
meroni
there
are
--
mr.
charles
f.
meroni
well
that
--
that
makes
no
finding
as
to
the
omissions
from
the
application
relative
to
the
commercial
number
two
system.
it
pertains
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
omitted
telling
the
patent
office
about
earlier
priority.
we
say
that
there
is
no
finding
on
this
particular
point
that
we're
raising
here,
under
the
fraud
point.
mr.
charles
f.
meroni
we
submitted
complete
findings
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
f.
meroni
my
recollection
is
that
we
did,
although
it
doesn't
appear
on
this
record,
because
the
findings
were
not
adopted
by
the
court.
now,
there's
one
other
point
your
honor
that
i'd
like
to
make
it
my
limited
time
here
and
that
is
--
and
that
is
on
page
36
of
the
--
of
our
opponents'
brief,
reference
is
made
to
the
juvenile
patent
and
an
argument
is
there
given,
which
we
believe
is
entirely
out
of
order.
that
patent
does
not
appear
before
this
court
and
is
not
certified
as
a
part
of
this
record.
and
we
believe
that
the
argument
on
page
36
of
respondent's
brief
should
be
ignored
by
this
court.
and
we'd
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
