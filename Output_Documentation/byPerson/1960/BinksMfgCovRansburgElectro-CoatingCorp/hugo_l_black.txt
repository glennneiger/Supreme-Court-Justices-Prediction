which
part
of
it
has
the
language
which
you've
just
referred?
justice

black
what
about
finding

does
that
have
any
reference
to
it?
im
not
i
don't
quite
understand
whether
it
does
or
not.
that
says
that
all
of
them
had
required
their
supplying
of
the
equipment.
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
i'm
as
what
i've
understanding
--
i
understood
you
to
say
that
no
one
had
ever
signed
any,
except
those
that
required
the
equipment
and
your
claim
is
that
they
had
to
do
that
to
get
any
contract
at
all,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
was
any
finding
that
says
anything
about
this
particular
form
of
contract
on
which
you
rely.
justice
hugo

black
did
you
ask
did
you
ask
for
any?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
without
a
finding
that
that
was
the
alternate?
the
alternate
finding
seems
to
be
other
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
the
force
of
your
argument,
if
you
had
something
to
show
that
this
concept
was
tendered
to
and
they'd
say
you
take
this
or
that
because
all
of
the
contract
seems
to
have
the
tie-in
probe.
that
was

(voice

when
do
you
show
or
how
do
we
find
out,
except
from
findings
about
this
alternative
that
you
should
give?
did
you
--
did
you
try
to
ask
for
anything
findings
and
have
them
rejected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
for
any
on
this
point
that
were
rejected?
did
you
ask
for
a
--

--
finding
to
the
effect
that
by
reason
of
there
being
300

whatever
it
was,
contracts
all
of
which,
contained
the

tie-in
clause,
it's
nothing
but
its
tie-in
clause,
did
you
ask
for
findings
as
to
the
effect
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
is
none.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
arguing
unless
you
are
challenging
the
findings
and
point
as
to
the
evidence
instead
of
showing
that
the
findings
are
wrong.
justice

i
can't
quite
understand
your
argument.

justice
hugo

that's
the
time
that
all
contracts
they
had
were
of
that
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government
seems
to
argue
i
assume,
that
from
the
fact
that
all
the
contracts
were
of
that
kind,
that
it
was
enough
to
show
that
the
tie-in
contract
had
to
be
made.
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
that
--
the
problem
is
let's
assumed
--
you're
assuming
though
that
there
was
no
real
alternative,
with
no
findings
to
back
it
and
not
showing
us
the
evidence
it
proves,
if
i
--
unless
i'm
wrong.
and
i'm
interested
in
that
point
because
it
seems
to
me
that

now,
where
do
we
--
where
can
we
know
that
it's
based
on
the
alternative
agreement
rather
than
evidence?
it
seems
to
be
based
on
evidence,
if
the
judge
heard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
then
in
connection
with
your
charge
(inaudible)
justice

so,
what
do
you
do
with
the

did
you

are
you
claiming

yes,
you
may.
you'd
better
rest
your

during
the
evidence
that
the
contract
on
which
he
relied
the
form
of
a
contract
on
which
your
adversary
relied,
was
offered
as
this
sole
alternative
to
buying

the
additional

justice
hugo

black
what
else
--
but
you
still
haven't
quite
answer
that
question.
whether
the
evidence
shows
that
this
alternative
contract
was
the
only
one
they
were
offered.
justice

a
form
of

which
you
referred
on

justice

and
then,
have
all
the
contracts
that
have
been
signed
during
all
that
period
of
time,
required
that
they
buy
apparatus
from
it?
justice

but
does
it
provide
that
they
do
buy
it?
had
there
ever
been
any
that
it
did
not?
justice

l.
black
well
you
mean,
take
--
take
the
license
at
the
--
under
this
other
form?
justice
hugo

which
did
provide
that
--
that
were
subject
to
such
changes
and
so
forth,
as
you
might
make?
justice

did

did
your
contracts
if
they
did

if
they
did
sign,
provide
for
the
supplying
of

out

and
was
that
obtainable
at
other
places?
justice

but
that
--
that
shows
does
it
not,
a
great
deal
of
a
--
of
an
equipment
that
was
--
could've
bought
on
the
market.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
a
little
confused
again
by
your
statement,
all
of
these
was
especially
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
looked
at
the
list
and
some
of
it
seems
to
be
not
especially
made
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice

black
like
you
design
a
heater
in
a
--
in
a
house,
a
particular
house?
justice

black
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
parts
that
you
were
selling
were
customarily
made
or
especially
made
for
this,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
about
(voice

above
the
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
was
reading
here
on
the
page
which
i
don't
quite
understand
where
if
they
accepted
the
contract
to
buy
the
equipment,
they
had
to
pay
more
than
they
did
if
they
got
it
without
the
equipment?
is
that
right?
justice

spelled
out
an
alternative
of
being
either
8400
or
10,400
depending
upon
what
the
customer
took,
whether
he
got
the
one
with
the
equipment
or
not
the
equipment,
is
that
what
it
referred
to?

right
after
what
you
referred
us
to.page

justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
reading
the
testimony
of
mr.
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
forgot
the,
web
carr?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
if
they
bought
the
equipment,
they
could
get
one
plan
and
if
they
bought
the
--
didn't
put
by
the
equipment
and
get
the
other.
in
one
instance,
should
cost
them
8400,
in
the
other
instance
would
cost
them
10,400.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
mean?
if
that's
the
one
that
web
carr
referred
to
as
ridiculous
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
he
have
to
pay
more
for
a
license?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
that
that
--
this,
it
has
had
me
confused,
is
because
i
haven't
read
enough
of
it
and
that's
the
reason
i
was
asking
you
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
still
--
that
confuses
me
a
little
as
putting
together.
it's
like
putting
together
hammers
as
i
understand
and
files
that
you
could
go
out
and
buy.
you
supplied
them
in
a
box
with
the
machine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
--
i'm
talking
about
when
you
supply
equipment,
it
did
include
thing
that
is
commonly
used
as
hammers
and
files,
did
it
not?
they
were
not
built
for
this
particular
machine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
there
was
some.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'm
talking
about
this
did
contain,
this
putting
together
or
simply
selling
them
additional
equipment
or
pats
that
they
could
have
gone
out
into
any
hardware
store
and
bought?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
wasn't
any
doubt
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
you
say
putting
together,
you
simply
mean
that
when
they
--
you
sold
them
this,
you
supplied
these
parts
that
they
could've
gotten
elsewhere
and
your
point
--
contention
is
of
course,
the
findings
show
that
they
didn't
have
to
do
that
but
they
did
it
because
they
wanted
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
confuse
me
again
when
you
say
common
place
things
in
it.
i
have
bought
some
machinery
where
they
sell
you
the
machinery
and
then
they
will
have
a
--
a
number
of
things
that
you
could
buy
elsewhere
and
you
get
with
it
for
convenience,
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you're
talking
about,
isn't
it?
you're
not
talking
about
parts
that
were
put
into
the
machine
itself
which
they
use.
you're
talking
about
things,
some
of
those
and
some
things
like
hammers
and
files
that
they
might
need
in
connection
with
doing
the
work
on
that
machinery
when
it
started
to
work.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
part
of
it
was
--
was
any
of
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
common
parts
of
this
machine
to
be
used
in
it
like
you
would
take
out
a
bolt
and
put
it
in
a
wheel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
that
were
not
common
that
you
supply
or
any
that
were
common
that
you
supplied?
that
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
--
we
are
not
to
take
it
on
the
basis
that
all
of
these
things
that
you
supplied
were
a
part
of
this
process
which
they
had
to
use.
but
some
of
them
were
tools
that
were
useful
in
connection
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
forget
the
word
tools.
alright,
i
--
i
don't
know
of
it
and
i'm
--
that's
the
reason
i'm
asking
you
and
the
questions
are
confusing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright
now,
can
you
buy
hose
anywhere
(voice

--
justice
hugo

was
there
any
difference
in
these
hose
to
the
other
hose
they
would
have
bought
somewhere
else?
justice
hugo

black
and
were
the
other
thing
like
that.
justice
hugo

black
would
you
explain
to
me
now
in
answering
at
what
you
mean
by
disjointed,
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
tell
me
what
you
mean
when
you
answer
it
that
they
were
not
disjointed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
they
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel?
i
mean
automobile,
a
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sold
out.
is
that
the
list
that
--
that
we
have
had
called
our
attention.
you
say
that
those
where
like
a
spokes
of
a
wheel
that's
a
part
this
process
that
you
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
every
one
of
them,
even
the
hose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
hose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you've
got
to
have
a
hose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
got
to
have
a
hose
if
you
work
on
washing
machine.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
--
ask
you,
this
--
you
refer
to
this
letter
on
page
283,
volume
3?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
letter
says,
in
the
second
paragraph
that,
"however,
the
prospective
customer
should
wish
to
use
equipment
other
than
ours,
it
would
not
be
contrary
to
our
policy."
you
--
i
understood
we're
referring
to
that
to
show
that
it
was
their
policy
to
refuse
to
let
people
have
licenses
unless
they
use
their
equipment.
and
it
says
that
the
second
paragraph
that
that
is
not
their
policy.
