black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black

go
ahead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
the
ones
that
caused
the
board
to
think
they
should
ask
him
these
other
questions?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
had
said,
as
i
understood
you,
those
particular
answers,
those
questions,
his
views
on
the
declaration
of
independence
prompted
the
board
to
say
they
had
--
they
went
further
to
ask
him
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
statement
was
made
before
that
if
you
will
read
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
happens
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
he
do
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
put
the
--
the
name
on
the
record
of
lawyers
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
class
comes
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
ever
known
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
ever
known
them
to
turn
one
down?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
we're
talking
about
favorable.
i
was
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
talking
about
favorable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
more
interested
in
what
happens
than
i
am
in
your
conclusion
as
to
what
it
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
when
this
committee
makes
a
favorable
report,
the
names
of
those
are
declared?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
practice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
practice
is
that
it
is
at
many
states,
i
assume,
to
go
and
introduce
them
to
the
supreme
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
--
has
there
ever
been
any
objection
that
you
know
of,
the
court
has
--
where
the
court
has
refused
after
the
committee
has
reported
favorably
to
admit
the
man
to
the
bar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
do
the
--
what
rules
have
you
printed
which
--
which
shows,
not
what
you
say
is
the
authority,
but
which
shows
what
the
court
--
what
is
required
of
the
lawyers
who
admitted,
is
that
in
statute
or
in
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
they
printed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who's
brief
on
the
merits?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
way
your
--
when
a
man
graduates
at
the
university
of
illinois,
do
you
have
a
special
rule
that
as
to
his
admission?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let
me
ask
you
what
this
section
means.
there
are
three
on
page
7.
if
the
committee
is
--
is
that
or
the
talking
there
about
the
very
committee
you're
talking
about
here?
if
the
committee
as
of
the
opinion
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
applicant
is
of
approved
character
and
moral
fitness,
what
committee
are
they
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they're
up
of
the
opinion,
if
the
applicant
is
of
approved
character
and
moral
fitness,
it's
so
--
so
certified
to
the
board
of
law
examiners
and
the
applicants
shall
thereafter
be
entitled
to
the
admission
to
the
bar.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
anything
--
any
other
rules
that
says
anything
different
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
statute
that
says
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
so
far
as
the
rules
or
regulations
of
the
statutes
are
concerned,
this
is
binding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
--
there's
nothing
else
that
--
is
--
is
there
anything
in
writing,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
you
say
now
but
anything
else,
is
there
anything
in
writing
anywhere
that
says,
"this
is
not
the
law?"
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
was
denied
admission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
whether
he
report
favorably.
and
it
--
they
say
that
they
shall
thereafter
be
admitted.
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
that
there
has
never
yet
been
rejection
by
the
court
after
the
committee
had
reported
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
"entitled"
to
mean?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
definition
that
says
that
it
means
anything
that
it's
different
to
what
it
always
means?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
no
authority
further?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
we
have
any
rule
like
this
one
that
you
know
anything
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
familiar
with
the
rule
and
number
of
state
where
they
permit
the
lawyers
to
go
to
the
university
of
the
state
to
be
admitted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
any
provision
to
test
the
character?
i'm
talking
about
the
original
provision.
i'm
not
talking
about
what
you
think
might
be
correct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
--
any
provision
to
test
the
character
except
this
way
of
testing
by
the
committee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
what
other
way
is
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
lucky
[laughter]
--
you
were
lucky
[laughter]
burglary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
you're
assuming
now
that
justice
frankfurter
asking
you
is
that
ends
it,
i
think
you
better
argue
on
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
understood
him
to
say
what
we
have
is
a
case
where
under
--
the
man
applied
and
the
court
could
have
gone
further
but
didn't.
now,
if
you
are
assuming
that
that
answers
that
question,
i'd
rather
you
would
point
to
something
which
shows
that
to
be
the
law
of
illinois.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but
involved
in
that,
arises
the
question
whether
your
rule
that
says
that
he
should
be
admitted
if
he
has
passed
it.
whether
that
means
that
that
entitled
him
to
admission,
whether
the
committee
really
has
the
final
say
so
with
--
on
those
points.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
didn't
know
until
it's
just
now
suggested
that
we've
got
to
construe
the
rule
of
illinois
by
what
ours
requires
because
it's
written
in
an
entirely
different
language.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
prefer
for
you
rather
than
to
take
it
for
granted
that
it
can
be
decided
by
a
man's
statement
from
the
bench
what
is
the
law
in
illinois
and
--
and
cite
it
in
writing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can't
do
it,
can
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
see
where
you
have
anything
in
illinois
that
says
this
rule
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
depending
on
construing
that
rule
about
what
our
rule
requires
an
entirely
different
(inaudible),
are
you?
i
--
i
won't
ask
you
that
question.
i
withdraw
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
cited
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
didn't
find
it
in
there
but
it's
alright.
if
any
trouble
--
don't
--
i'll
--
i'll
