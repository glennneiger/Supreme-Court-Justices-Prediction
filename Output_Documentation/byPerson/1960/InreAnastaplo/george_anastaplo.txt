mr.
george
anastaplo
thank
you,
sir.
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
state
of
illinois
with
respect
to
my
application
for
admission
to
the
bar.
i
should
like
to
divide
my
argument
into
four
parts.
first,
which
i
attempt
the
brief
survey
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
second,
to
proceed
--
to
analysis
for
the
character
and
fitness
evidence
in
the
case.
third,
to
a
consideration
of
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
refusal
of
the
state
bar
authorities
to
abide
by
the
character
and
fitness
evidence,
as
i
see
it,
and
second
--
and
the
fourth
part
attempt
to
discuss
the
second
of
the
two
reasons
that
are
given.
i
kind
of
hope
to
do
more
and
to
consider
quickly
some
of
the
matters
which
i
have
--
perhaps
rather
exhaustedly
discussed
in
my
brief.
let
me
say
at
the
outset,
in
--
in
doing
so,
a
quote
from
my
brief
that
is
well
to
emphasize
which
should
be
apparent
from
the
statement
into
the
case
and
to
the
facts
which
i
will
narrate.
the
question
of
membership
to
communist
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
i'm
sorry.
the
question
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
are
in
the
ku
klux
klan
is
not
an
issue
in
this
bar
admission
case.
but
at
most,
only
the
effect
in
the
bar
admission
proceeding
of
a
conscientious
refusal
to
answer
in
parties
about
such
membership
when
it's
conceded
that
there
is
no
allegation
or
evidence
in
membership
when
the
inquiries
occur
only
in
the
context
of
badgering
about
philosophical
and
political
views,
particularly
views
about
the
right
through
--
about
the
right
of
revolution,
and
when
silence
is
couched
in
a
form
of
refusal
to
submit
to
something
deemed
by
the
applicant
to
be
in
the
nature
of
the
test
oath
and
to
be
improper
ungentlemanly
and
unconstitutional
inquiry.
this
case
began
10
years
ago
in
november
of
1950
when
the
occasion
of
my
appearance
--
my
first
appearance
before
the
bar
admission
committee
in
chicago.
at
that
time,
the
questions
that
were
being
asked
of
bar
applicants
were
concerned
mostly
with
what
is
traditionally
considered
to
be
character
and
fitness
matters.
however,
on
occasion,
the
committee
would
stray
into
other
areas
that
is
to
say
if
the
--
if
for
some
reason
the
applicant
made
them
suspicious
or
otherwise
antagonize
them,
there
would
be
--
there
would
then
emerged
questions
about
political
matters.
one
of
the
test
questions
then
being
asked
was,
"do
you
believe
that
a
member
of
the
communist
party
should
be
permitted
to
practice
at
bar
in
illinois?"
that
indeed
was
a
question
that
was
asked
to
me.
i
answered
that
i
thought
that
the
communist
party
member
should
be
permitted
to
--
to
practice
law
if
these
were
all
--
there
was
no
--
i'm
paraphrasing
now
the
first
few
exchanges."
thereupon,
the
discussion
turned
to
the
problem
of
"right
of
revolution"
simply
because
it
was
thought
that
the
communists
espouse
revolution
and
therefore
should
not
be
eligible
for
admission."
i
responded
with
the
observation
that
i
thought
that
espousal
or
revolution
should
be
no
grounds
for
exclusion.
this
--
this
prompted
rather
here
to
exchange
which
thereupon
led
to
one
of
the
members
of
the
committee
panel
asking,
"are
you
a
member
of
this
or
that
organization?
but
first
of
all,
give
me
all
your
organizations
that
you're
member
of,"
and
finally
concluding,
"are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
to
which
i
responded
that
they
had
no
right
to
ask
such
a
question
and
that
in
any
event,
i
will
not
answer
it.
and
that
has
been
essentially
the
position
ever
since.
i
will
return
to
this
--
both
of
these
points,
the
unanswered
questions
and
the
refusal
and
the
reviews
on
declaration
of
independence,
the
"right
of
revolution”.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir,
in
illinois,
it's
after
the
applicant
has
finished
law
school,
passed
the
bar
examination
and
fulfilled
all
other
requirements.
this
is
the
last
stage.
and
i
may
say
it's
usually
a
formal,
rather
formal
stage
in
the
sense
that
--
it's
usually
applied
to
have
any
proceeding
is
--
is
over
with.
the
--
in
1954,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
considered
my
appeal
from
that
earlier
decision
and
rejected
it.
the
--
as
you
know,
i
attempted
to
secure
review
in
this
court
and
failed
at
that
time
to
secure
review.
thereupon,
in
1957,
after
the
--
this
court
handed
down
the
decision
in
the
konigsberg
and
schware
cases,
i
again
reapplied
for
rehearing.
the
committee,
thereupon,
asked
me
to
state
my
position
on
two
points,
one,
what
are
my
present
views
in
the
"right
of
revolution”,
what
is
my
present
attitude
toward
the
questions
i
had
previously
refused
to
answer.
and
i,
thereupon,
answered
in
that
supplementary
petition,
which
is
found
at
page
484
of
the
record,
in
which
i
explained
my
views
on
"right
of
revolution”
where
--
and
in
which
i
said
that
i
will
continue
to
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
about
any
--
for
the
organizations,
which
i
should
also
note
at
this
time,
had
included
questions
about
communist
party,
the
ku
klux
klan
and
all
other
organizations
to
which
you
might
belong.
i
appealed
from
the
order
of
the
court
or
the
committee
refusing
to
rehear
my
application.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
in
the
fall
of
that
year,
handed
down
an
order
which
is
found
in
the
record
and
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
of
the
court
--
in
the
(inaudible)
of
the
court
below.
that
order
which
is
best
illuminated
if
you'll
look
at
pages
6
and
7
of
my
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
that
order
was
--
was
one
in
which
the
court
ordered
the
committee
or
requested
the
committee
to
rehear
the
application.
if
you'll
notice
in
the
third
paragraph
of
that
--
of
that
order,
"the
principle
question
presented
by
the
petition
for
rehearing
concerns
the
significance
of
the
applicant's
views
as
to
the
overthrow
of
government
by
force
in
the
light
of
konigsberg
and
yates.
additional
questions
presented
concern
the
applicant's
activities
since
his
original
application
was
denied
and
his
present
reputation."
that's
on
page
7
of
my
petition
of
the
appendix
--
i'm
sorry,
of
the
appendix
to
my
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
if
you'll
notice
that
page,
exactly
opposite
down,
page
6,
you'll
find
there
a
dissent
of
the
member
--
of
one
member
of
the
committee
who
had
--
who
has
suggested
that
the
committee
should
rehear
the
case
without
any
further
proceeding.
mr.
roscoe
suggested
that
the
committee
should
not
send
the
case
up
--
should
not
deny
the
rehearing
of
the
application
in
1957
but
should
take
on
its
own
to
rehear
it.
and
if
you'll
notice
the
language
of
his
final
paragraph
is,
except
for
few
minor
changes,
the
language
that
the
court
has
self
adopted
within
order
of
the
rehearing.
mr.
george
anastaplo
on
page
6,
sir
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
--
of
the
--
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i'm
sorry.
it's
found
nowhere
else
in
the
record,
i
should
say.
you'll
notice
that
mr.
roscoe
says,
"i
will
grant
the
petition
for
rehearing,
take
evidence
on
one
applicant's
activities
during
the
period."
and
you'll
notice
that's
the
second
point
of
the
court's
order
to
his
present
reputation
which
is
the
third
point
of
the
court's
order,
three,
his
views
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government,
which
is
the
principle
question
that
the
court
ordered
the
committee
to
hear.
and
i
cannot
now
show
it
to
you
because
it
requires
a
very
careful
analysis
of
his
opinion
--
of
his
dissenting
opinion.
but
you
will
see
that
what
had
been
ruled
out
by
him,
as
--
in
--
no
longer
applicable
for
consideration
was
the
refusal
of
--
my
refusal
to
--
to
answer
questions
about
these
affiliations.
he
thought
that
that
was
no
longer
applicable
because
of
the
konigsberg
case.
and
consequently,
he
--
he
argues
that
throughout
his
opinion
then
says,
"these
are
the
only
three
questions
left."
and
i
argued
the
--
in
consequence
that
the
court
also
seem
to
say
this
by
silently
rejecting
the
--
at
any
reference
to
the
problem
of
the
questions
unanswered
which
the
committee
had
raised
when
it
--
i've
--
i
gone
before
them
for
the
rehearing
application.
this,
i
suggest,
also
was
their
rather
tactical
way
of
advising
their
committee
that
there
was
no
need
to
go
off
on
this
again.
and
you
will
see
later,
i
believe,
why
they
should
want
--
but
first
of
all
to
be
tackle
and
two,
what
it
thought
it
should
not
be
done.
the
committee,
however,
disregarded
what
i
take
to
be
--
to
have
been
the
mandate
of
court.
the
court
later,
i
should
add,
disregarded
what
it
had
itself
implicitly
suggested.
mr.
george
anastaplo
no,
sir.
not
all
of
them
but
more
and
yet
different
ones.
mr.
george
anastaplo
not
in
this
manner.
not
that
i
can
recollect.
mr.
george
anastaplo
the
--
the
second
questions
--
second,
third
and
fourth
questions
are
still
in
effect
being
asked.
the
first,
second,
fifth
and
sixth
are
not
being
asked
any
longer.
but
in
addition,
there
have
been
questions
asked
about
any
number
of
organizations,
some
of
which
neither
of
the
committee
nor
i
knew
anything
about
except
the
fact
that
they
were
on
the
attorney
general's
list
in
which
i
refuse
to
answer.
secondly,
there
were
questions
asked
about
religious
affiliations
and
beliefs
which
i
refused
to
answer
and
which
the
committee
later
on
repudiated
in
circumstances
that
by
themselves
interesting,
that
is
to
say
they
repudiated
partly,
i
suspect,
because
one
member
of
the
committee
made
a
mistake
upon
rely
--
of
relying
upon
a
case
that
had
been
overruled
in
support
of
his
questions
and
when
that
was
shown
up,
the
--
the
whole
thing
sort
of
crumbled.
mr.
george
anastaplo
on
theory
that
an
applicant
who
must
take
an
oath
must
show
or
must
be
--
may
be
asked
to
show
that
his
views
about
god
and
the
eternal
or
such
has
to
make
his
oath
meaningful.
they
--
the
question
was
asked
whether
or
not
i
believe
in
god,
whether
i
had
any
sanctions
to
my
oath
in
addition
to
the
ordinary
ones
such
as
fear
of
perjury,
one's
self-respect,
one's
respect
for
the
truth
and
so
forth.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes
and
no,
sir.
not
formally
in
the
sense
that
they
repudiated
it.
but
yes,
in
a
way,
because
i
--
it's
my
suggestion
that
those
questions
in
a
way
point
up
the
whole
problem
with
the
committee's
procedure,
that
is
to
say
those
questions
were
before
the
committee
for
approximately
three
or
four
weeks
through
several
sessions.
they
were
only
repudiated
later
after
very
strenuous
resistance
on
my
part.
they
are
before
you
in
other
sense.
they
indicate
to
you.
i
suggest
that
there
is
no
rule,
practice,
procedure
or
statute
in
illinois
which
says
that
all
questions
must
be
answered.
mr.
george
anastaplo
well
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
that's
partly,
sir.
judge
bristol,
in
fact,
makes
that
point
that
two
--
one
member
of
the
committee
had
said
that
this
is
so
important
to
me
that
a
--
that
a
member
of
--
of
the
--
that
an
applicant
permission
who
refuses
to
answer
that
kind
of
question
would
raise
serious
problems
for
him.
mr.
george
anastaplo
well
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
well,
i
would
not
go
that
far.
i
would
say
that
it
makes
it
unlikely.
i
would
also
add
that
the
fact
that
they
had
to
be
repudiated
does
not
make
the
petitioner's
or
the
applicant's
standing
what
the
people
who
have
had
their
question
repudiated
any
higher.
as
to
say,
there
is
no
member
of
the
committee
who
had
a
question
refused
and
answered
a
question
refused
that
he
asked
who
voted
for
my
application.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes.
mr.
george
anastaplo
that
--
i
think
that
--
that
can
be
said
but
i
would
also
add
that
it
also
indicates
that
there
is
no
practice
in
illinois
that
any
question
that
one
asks
--
is
asked
must
answered.
and
that,
of
course,
has
implications
which
i
would
view
shortly.
now,
the
1958
hearings
which
ran
for
six
sessions,
approximately
20
hours,
dealt
with
character
and
fitness
in
the
ordinary
sense
about
where
i've
worked,
what
i've
done
and
so
forth.
they'd
also
returned
to
the
old
questions
about
the
affiliations
which
i
refused
to
answer,
the
same
reasons,
expelling
the
reasons
out.
it
included
the
religious
question
that
i
referred
to.
it
included
long
discussions
about
the
declaration
of
independence
on
the
right
of
revolution.
it
also
included
something
that
is
distinctive.
it
included
the
concession
of
the
committee
at
one
point
of
the
hearing
after
considerable
amount
of
effort
on
my
part
to
get
the
concession
from
them.
the
concession
was
that
we
have
never
had
any
kind
of
evidence,
any
affirmation,
any
suggestion
to
us
that
you're
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
ku
klux
klan
or
any
of
the
other
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list.
and
this
is
a
concession
which
has
a
bearing
upon
the
importance
of
the
unanswered
questions.
mr.
george
anastaplo
at
--
i
think
it's
three
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i'll
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
i'll
--
i
think
it's
234.
yes,
234
of
the
record.
but
i
will
deal
with
this
also.
thereupon,
after
the
committee
again
refused
my
application,
this
time
by
a
vote
of,
say,
2-to-1,
that
is
to
say
11
--
6-to-11
--
11-to-6.
i
appealed
once
--
once
more
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
in
this
--
in
this
occasion
that
the
court
upheld
them
by
--
by
a
vote
of
4-to-3,
with
justices
bristol,
schaefer
and
davis
dissenting.
and
on
that
--
it's
from
that
opinion
and
--
the
decision
that
i
appeal
here.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
anastaplo
the
--
the
commissioners
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
that
is
correct.
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief,
now,
i
turn
to
the
character
and
fitness
evidence
simply.
it
seems
to
concede
that
that
evidence
is,
in
the
ordinary
sense,
overwhelming
and
uncontradicted.
but
then,
of
course,
he
does
not
--
not
addressed
to
that.
but
i
say
the
evidence
in
the
ordinary
sense,
that
is
to
say
as
to
what
--
when
life
is
life
but
when
it's
done,
his
occupation,
his
activities
or
whether
he
is
honest
with
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
no.
i'll
--
it's
probably
my
fault,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
anastaplo
you
know
--
i
say
the
character
and
fitness
--
moral
character
of
the
--
character
and
fitness
in
the
ordinary
sense
seems
to
be
conceded
to
be
overwhelming
and
uncontradicted.
certainly,
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
--
any
evidence
in
record
and
no
one
has
very
pointed
any
evidence
in
the
record
which
would
contradict
this.
in
--
in
fact,
if
you
will
turn
to
record
514,
you
will
find
that
the
court
itself,
below,
makes
this
concession.
you
will
see
at
the
bottom
of

514,
if
i
may
read
it,
"during
the
interval
between
the
denial
of
his
original
application
and
the
submission
of
his
second
application,
anastaplo
has
been
employed
greater
part
of
the
time
as
an
instructor
and
research
assistant
at
the
university
of
chicago.
the
character
affidavits
and
letters
of
reference
supplied
by
anastaplo
disclosed
that
he
is
well
regarded
by
his
academic
associates,
by
professors
that
had
taught
to
him
in
school
and
by
lawyers
who
were
personally
acquainted
with
him.
the
committee
said
that
it's
not
been
supplied
of
any
information
by
any
third
party
which
is
derogatory
to
anastaplo's
character
of
general
reputation
and
it
has
received
no
information
from
any
outside
source
which
would
cast
any
doubt
on
anastaplo's
loyalty
or
which
would
pretend
to
connect
him
in
any
manner
with
any
subversive
group."
and
then
this
next
sentence,
"the
committee
further
advises
us
that
he
has
--
he
has
conducted
no
independent
investigation
into
anastaplo's
character,
reputation
or
activities."
now,
if
you
will
turn
then
to
page
542,
you
will
see
judge
bristol's
evaluation
of
his
evidence."
any
realistic
appraisal,"
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
page,
"any
realistic
appraisal
of
this
record
indicates
that
from
the
search
and
examination
of
applicant,
from
his
letters
and
writings
and
the
responsibilities
of
a
citizen
and
lawyer
to
our
government
and
the
writings
of
statesmen
and
the
scholars,
refused
to
embrace
from
the
affidavits
enlisted
by
the
committee
and
from
the
committee's
own
independent
investigation,
you
should
have
well
known
that
his
moral
--
he
should
--
he
should
have
well
known
--
he
should
have
known
well
george
anastaplo,
his
moral
character
and
his
views
respecting
our
constitutional
government.
moreover,
through
its
power
of
subpoena,
the
committee
could
have
supplemented
that
fund
of
knowledge
if
necessary."
now,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
that
one
state,
a
closing
question,
a
closing
point
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
on
page
5
--
4
--
15,
that
is
the
committee
further
advises
us
that
it
has
conducted
no
independent
investigation.
this
is
not
quite
accurate.
that
is
to
say,
if
you
--
you
will
find
references
collected
in
the
record
in
the
brief
at
page
--
note
54
of
my
brief
in
the
merit
which
indicate
that
a
number
of
investigations
or
inquiries
were
indeed
made.
and
on
may
1950
and
1951,
an
investigator
called
my
hometown
at
least
two
occasions
and
found
nothing
adverse
and
consequently
nothing
to
be
purported.
and
as
indicated
also
by
that
same
--
in
the
note
54
of
my
brief,
there
are
indications
that
members
of
the
committee
on
this
occasion
made
independent
inquiries
of
lawyers,
teachers,
people
who
knew
me
in
chicago
found
nothing
adverse
and
consequently
nothing
was
reported.
it
seems
to
be
true
unless
something
adverse
is
found
or
something
that
goes
against
the
general
trend
of
the
record,
it
is
not
worth
noting.
now,
to
be
precise
of
the
character
point,
i
should
also
remind
you
about
the
affidavits
and
references
that
are
found
in
the
record.
and
--
and
particularly
the
ones
at
405
and
following
which
are
from
(inaudible)
who
are
--
who
can
be
expected,
i
--
i,
there
say,
to
speak
honestly,
and
who
--
who
wrote
directly
to
the
committee
and
not
to
me,
whose
--
whose
affidavits
i
did
not
even
see
until
after
the
record
been
made
--
had
been
sent
to
the
committee.
this
has
the
other
evidence,
i
suggest,
substantially
supports
the
clear
indication
in
the
record
that
on
ordinary
character
and
fitness
grounds,
there
is
no
problem.
now,
why
not
this
evidence
allowed
to
stand?
i
mean
why
is
it
not
allowed
to
have
its
full
effect?
and
we
must
not
think
that
the
--
the
burden
in
these
manners
is
very
heavy
in
the
ordinary
sense.
i've
already
referred
to
the
fact
that
hearings
are
conducted
very
quickly
usually
and
more
or
less
pro
forma.
the
evidence
is
not
allowed
to
stand
as
it's
indicated
both
by
the
committee
and
by
the
court
for
two
reasons.
one,
because
of
some
views
i
expressed
in
the
"right
of
revolution”,
and
two
because
of
the
questions
i
have
refused
to
answer.
let
me
deal
with
the
latter
first.
now,
the
failure
to
answer
questions
as
to
possible
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
the
ku
klux
klan
which
is
urged
the
basis
for
rejection
has
to
be
examined
with
somewhat
more
care,
i
submit,
that
it
has
been
examined
below.
one,
i
--
i
take
it,
no
one
has
denied
that
the
reasons
for
not
answering
these
questions
are
not
trivial,
that
is
to
say
that
the
sincerity
or
the
refusal
to
answer
doesn't
seem
to
be
questioned.
and
as
you'll
see
in
the
record,
there
are
extensive
explanation
of
why
the
refusal
is
made.
now
--
and
especially
you
will
find
that
my
closing
argument,
which
is
at
page
314
of
the
record,
my
more
or
less
comprehensive
view
of
what
the
case
is
about
and
why
i
have
not
taken
--
i
refused
to
answer
for
any
questions
about
political
affiliations.
now,
i'm
prepared
to
argue
that
the
questions
themselves
are
generally
improper
for
bar
admission
proceeding.
but
that
is
unnecessary
to
be
reached
here.
i
--
i
have
set
forth
the
arguments
in
the
brief
but
let
me
go
on
to
consideration
of
what
the
failure
to
answer
in
this
context
means.
the
--
let
me
emphasize
first
of
all
that
there
is
not
any
statute
or
rule
in
illinois
requiring
the
asking
of
questions
about
affiliations.
the
only
requirement
is
to
respect
the
character
and
fitness.
and
on
page
7
of
--
of
my
brief,
you
will
find
the
principle
controlling
rule
set
forth.
it
is
the
rule
of
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
sets
up
the
committee
and
prescribes
its
powers
in
which
--
which
concludes,
if
the
committee
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
applicant
is
of
approved
moral
--
approved
character
and
moral
fitness,
it
shall
--
so
--
it
shall
so
certify
to
the
board
of
law
examiners
and
the
applicants
shall
thereafter
be
entitled
to
admission
to
the
bar.
now,
if
you
compare
this
to
the
statutes
which
require
non-communist
oaths,
such
as
one
we
have
in
illinois,
for
employees.
you
will
find
that
this
isn't
worth
--
this
is
more
difference.
there
is
no
requirement
anywhere
that
is
placed
upon
the
committee
either
by
rule
of
court,
by
statute
or
by
decision
that
no
requirement
that
they
must
get
into
these
questions
that
they
must
settle
them,
that
they
must
answer
them.
in
fact,
as
i've
already
--
the
1957
order
which
--
which
--
under
which
this
rehearing
was
conducted
can
be
read.
it
can
be
read
as
implicitly
suggesting
to
them
that
they'll
not
go
into
these
questions.
in
fact,
judge
bristol,
at
535,
addresses
himself
to
this
very
point.
he
says,
"although
the
majority
report
denied
applicant
admission
to
the
bar
essentially
because
they
claimed
his
failure
to
reply
to
questions
on
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
other
subversive
groups,
prevented
inquiry
in
the
subjects
which
bear
an
issue
of
character,
it
is
significant
that
the
majority
made
favorable
findings
on
all
matters
designed
for
inquiry
in
our
rehearing
order."
they
found
that
applicants
the
use
of
"right
of
revolution”
was
not
objectionable
nor
was
there
anything
objectionable
in
its
activities
since
the
original
petition
was
denied
or
with
respect
to
its
present
reputation.
if
there
is
no
rule,
if
there
is
no
statute,
if
there
is
no
order
requiring
these
questions
to
be
asked
or
answered,
what
basis
is
there?
well,
the
only
basis
for
asking
the
questions
seems
to
have
been
the
espousal
of
the
declaration
of
independence,
that
is
the
concession
the
attorney
general
seems
to
make
in
pages
9
and
30
of
his
brief
and
to
this
i
will
return.
then
we
have,
in
evaluating
the
refusal
of
the
question
--
refusal
to
answer
his
questions
we
have
the
concession,
which
i
have
already
quoted,
that
is
to
say
the
concession
for
the
committee
that
they
have
no
evidence
with
respect
to
this
matter
whatsoever.
yet,
the
committee
acclaims
that
they
have
been
obstructed
in
the
--
in
the
fulfillment
of
their
duty,
that
without
answers
to
these
questions,
they
cannot
reach
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not,
one's
character
and
fitness
is
adequate
for
admission
to
the
bar.
now,
this
obstruction,
i
take
it,
must
be
one
of
two
kinds.
it
can
be
a
constructive.
it's
not
the
word
they
used,
but
i
think
it's
better
than
any
word
they
do
use.
attorney
general
seems
to
suggest
this
in
his
argument,
he
talks
about
presumptions.
but
this
kind
of
constructive
obstruction,
i
submit,
would
follow
only
if
there
is
a
legal
basis
for
requiring
answers
to
all
questions.
but
i
also
have
--
must
say
that
there
is
none.
and
there
--
and
furthermore,
there
was
not
in
this
hearing
any
kind
of
indication
that
questions
must
be
answered,
all
questions
must
be
answered
at
every
point
where
the
committee
was
near
giving
anything
like
a
warning
that
all
questions
must
be
answered.
they
qualified
it.
and
you
will
see
this
throughout
the
record.
you'll
see
it
throughout
my
brief
on
the
merits.
the
brief
in
the
merits
is
consigned
--
is
devoted
primarily
to
a
very
long
and
i
think
careful
summary
of
the
facts
of
the
case
and
i
have
italicized
in
it
the
various
places
where
the
committee
backs
away
from
any
kind
of
warning,
from
any
kind
of
clear
indication
that
they
would
not
consider
further
application
in
which
one
has
refused
to
answer.
they
--
they
simply
say
that
this
would
be
one
more
piece
of
evidence,
that's
the
most
they
can
say,
serious,
perhaps,
but
one
more
piece
of
evidence,
not
a
clear
cut
basis
of
rejection.
the
--
and
of
course,
a
good
example
of
why
this
kind
of
warning
cannot
be
made,
why
the
rule
cannot
be
made,
is
effect
that
you
can
see
the
religious
questions
because
the
committee
members
are
essentially
uncontrolled
and
uncontrollable.
everyone
can
ask
what
he
pleases.
there
is
no
effort,
so
far
as
i've
ever
seen,
to
restrain
them.
consequently,
the
committee
does
not
want
to
bind
itself
to
whatever
any
particular
member
might
add
and
--
and
therefore,
they
cannot
make
a
more
formal
rule
such
as
that
which
might
follow
that.
if
you
don't
give
your
name,
if
you
don't
give
us
your
criminal
record,
if
you
don't
answer
to
fill
out
the
questionnaire,
therefore,
we
will
not
teach
you.
that
--
that's
the
situation
here.
now,
if
there
is
not
what
i
call
constructive
obstruction,
i
think
everything
in
the
record
would
indicate
there
cannot
be
constructive
obstruction.
if
there
is
not
what
i
call
constructive
obstruction,
was
their
actual
obstruction?
what
would
they,
in
fact,
unable
to
reach
a
conclusion
of
character
and
fitness?
well,
did
this
impede
them?
as
i've
said
before,
this
committee
hearing
ran
on
for
20
hours
or
so
over
several
months,
20
hours
after
the
first
refusal
to
answer
was
--
was
given.
in
fact,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
knew
even
before
the
hearing
started
that
would
continue
to
refuse
to
answer
these
questions
that
document,
i've
referred
to
you
already
at
page
484
on
basis
of
which
the
--
the
order
in
1957
was
granted
was
itself
--
clearly
indicate
--
itself
clearly
indicated
that
i
would
continue
to
stick
my
position
i've
taken
before.
and
yet,
the
--
the
order
did
grant
the
rehearing
and
the
rehearing
ran.
now,
furthermore,
the
fact
is
that
the
committee,
not
only
knew
the
question
and
not
answer,
but
they
again,
again
said
they
wanted
to
know
the
reasons
why.
they
want
to
examine
with,
they
want
to
discuss
it,
which
i've
cleared
the
implication
that
the
thing
was
open.
furthermore,
i
should
think
that
if
a
committee
is
going
to
allege
obstruction,
it
must
act
as
if
it
had
been
obstructive.
that's
not
the
case
here.
you
cannot
say
that
a
record
which
ran
for
400
pages
after
the
first
or
several
hundred
pages,
i
say,
at
least
350
pages
after
the
first
questions
refusal
to
answer
were
put
to
an
applicant.
you
cannot
say
that
that
is
obstruction,
obstructive
hearing.
the
committee
ran,
i
suppose
it,
one
or
two,
they
asked
all
the
questions
they
wanted
to,
oath
committee
members
asked
questions.
true,
they
could
not
ask
questions
that
would
follow
from
the
refusal
from
an
answer
as
to
affiliations
but
that
is
not,
i
there
say,
much
of
--
of
objection
because
it
says
the
fact
that
their
concession
about
no
evidence
and
no
other
--
and
no
information
to
this
respect.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir,
there
was
never
this
kind
of
unequivocal
warning.
mr.
george
anastaplo
let
me
also
add,
in
all
fairness,
isn't
they
had
--
as
to
not
have
answered
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
that's
certainly
true
and
this
is
pointed
out
very
nicely,
by
the
way,
in
professor's
calvin
and
steffen's
amicus
brief.
mr.
george
anastaplo
that
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
that
is
somewhat
different
phrasing,
mr.
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
some
of
them
said
these
were
very
important
questions
for
us.
some
said
they
might
even
say
vital.
mr.
george
anastaplo
some
of
them
even
say
they're
vital
questions.
some
of
them,
we
think
they
are
very
important.
but
i
thought
the
chief
justice's
question
was,
did
they
say
that
unless
you
refuse
to
answer,
we
would
not
admit
you
or
would
not
recommend
your
admission
which
all
we
can
do.
mr.
george
anastaplo
that
was
not
what
they
ever
said.
mr.
george
anastaplo
no,
i
--
i
do
not
want
to
say
either,
sir.
mr.
george
anastaplo
oh,
sorry.
no,
i
had
a
pretty
good
idea
that
if
i
persisted,
i
--
in
this
position,
i
might
be
rejected
again.
mr.
george
anastaplo
but
i
also
had
the
idea
that
was
a
possibility
i
might
convert
two
or
three
more.
mr.
george
anastaplo
the
first
time
i
was.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes.
mr.
george
anastaplo
no,
sir,
not
in
1958.
by
that
time,
i
had
--
i
had
been
given
plenty
of
warning
of
a
certain
kind.
but
i
do
not
believe
i
--
that
is
a
kind
of
warning
that
is
required
for
a
more
or
less
automatic
application
of
a
rule
which
says,
"no
answer,
you
must
be
excluded."
that
--
i
--
i
think
that
has
rested
on
some
kind
of
rule
or
statute
which
i
do
not
think
they
can
really
set
up
in
this
case
because
of
difficulties
with
members
of
the
--
of
the
committee.
mr.
george
anastaplo
so
far
as
that
notice
has
been
defined
in
the
konigsberg
case,
yes,
sir.
i
have
not
had
that
notice.
on
the
other
hand,
i
would
not
rely
upon
that
distinction
because
as
i
said
to
you,
even
with
--
even
with
such
notice,
i
still
would
not
have
answered
these
questions.
now
--
now
the
problem
is
then,
i
--
i
take
it,
the
real
question
is
what
does
this
refusal
which
is
clearly,
i
believe,
on
some
kind
of
principle
whether
misguided
or
not.
what
does
this
refusal
mean?
i
think
it's
one
piece
of
evidence
to
be
evaluated
like
all
the
rest.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
court
should
act
as
state
supreme
court
judges
or
as
legislators,
second
guessing.
or
i
realized
some
of
you
may
well
think
that
if
you
had
been
on
this
committee
or
if
you've
been
on
a
court,
you
might
have
acted
differently
from
the
majority.
that
is
not
the
point
i'm
making.
the
point
i'm
making
is
this,
if
you
had
been
an
applicant
and
you
were
asked
these
questions
and
you
refused
to
answer
in
thinking
that
they
were
improper,
uncalled
for,
unfounded
or
for
any
number
of
reasons
that
have
some
plausibility
and
which
in
the
record
are
very
clearly
shown
to
be
based
on
some
kind
of
principle,
constitutional
rather,
would
your
refusal
on
these
circumstances
--
should
i
refuse
them
--
these
terms
has
to
be
regarded
as
adverse
evidence
to
application
for
admission
on
moral
and
character
grounds?
that
is
the
issue
and
not
what
you
would
not
--
would
or
would
not
do
if
you
were
sitting
in
the
seat
as
supreme
court
judge.
i
will
go
further.
i
would
say
that
this
evidence
in
this
record,
in
a
circumstance
to
this
case,
is
really
favorable
evidence.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
note
40
in
my
brief
which
is
at
page
69.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir.
on
page
69
in
which
i
quote
there
from
the
law
--
from
the
law
review
article
by
brown
and
--
spencer
brown
of
yale.
and
he
gives
there
an
indication
of
what
the
atmosphere
has
been
in
chicago
respect
--
in
the
course
of
which
these
proceedings
took
place.
you
see
at
the
bottom
page,
he
says,
"the
fair
petitioner,"
that's
me,
"the
fair
petitioner
made
a
considerable
impression
on
his
contemporary
in
chicago."
one
of
them
wrote
as
follows,
"although
i
have
never
been
a
communist
nor
a
member
of
--
of
organizations
on
the
attorney
general's
list,
my
enter
to
the
such
that
had
i
acted
with
complete
sincerity,"
i
would
not
have
replied,
"no,
sir,"
of
the
questions
i
was
asked
what
membership
in
subversive
organizations.
but
i
decided
in
advance
as
did
most
of
my
friends
to
give
the
answers
best
fitted
to
admission
to
the
bar
without
difficulty.
that
is
the
atmosphere
in
which
all
these
proceedings
took
place
and
that's
why
i
suggest
that
if
anything,
this
evidence
might
well
be
taken
to
be
favorable
evidence
for
an
application
for
admission.
and
the
fact
that
there
is
this
kind
of
atmosphere
and
this
kind
of
intimidation,
in
bullying
of
applicants,
is
one
reason
why
i
have
taken
the
position
that
i
have.
now,
i
promised
you
this
word
to
our
declaration
of
independence.
i've
always
thought
necessary,
as
lincoln
thought
necessary,
to
insist
upon
a
declaration
of
independence
as
one
of
the
--
the
constitutional
documents
on
--
upon
which
this
nation
is
based.
my
position,
your
honors,
has
been
one
of
defense
with
the
declaration.
attorney
general
concedes
that
it
was
my
defense
or
rather
more
than
that,
it
was
my
espousal
or
the
very
words
of
the
declaration
that
made
the
questions
necessary.
if
you'll
turn
to
page
30
of
his
brief,
on
page
30
he
says,
"if
petitioner
means
to
suggest,
committee
on
character
and
fitness
must
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
i'm
sorry,
page
30
of
--
of
the
attorney
general's
brief.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i'm
sorry,
sir.
it's
the
blue
covered.
mr.
george
anastaplo
"if
petitioner
means
to
suggest
that
the
committee
on
character
and
fitness
must
ask
every
applicant
question
as
to
his
possible
membership
and
affiliations
with
subversive
groups
or
may
ask
none
of
them
any
such
questions,
his
argument
seriously
misconceives
the
committee's
functions
and
gravely
misprices
the
import
of
the
equal
protection.
petitioner
had
admittedly
written
some
prose
that
could
not
possibly
disqualify
him
ipso
facto
from
any
right
or
privilege
to
which
he
was
otherwise
entitled.
that
--
but
that
did
awaken
a
most
natural
inquiry
as
to
what
he
meant
by
it."
what
prose
what
this?
well
--
and
i
must
refer
you
to
my
reply
brief
which
i
set
the
prose
out.
i
discussed
this
issue
there
between
pages
12
and
17
and
on
page
15,
you'll
find
the
prose
upon
which
it
seems
to
be
said
the
inquiries
were
based
which
awaken
the
most
natural
inquiry.
and
you
--
you'll
find
there,
in
the
essay,
which
i
submitted
in
1950
as
part
of
the
petition
--
as
part
of
the
application
for
admission.
and
you'll
also
find
toward
the
bottom
of
the
essay,
a
number
of
words
italicized.
these,
so
far
as
i
know,
these
are
the
only
expressions,
the
only
prose
which
can
be
taken
by
any
reasonable
stretch
of
imagination
to
have
been
the
basis
of
the
inquiry
in
--
according
to
attorney
general's
formulation.
that
is
to
say,
i
conclude
this
essay
on
--
in
answer
--
response
to
the
questions
and
statements
which
you
consider
to
be
the
principles
underlying
the
constitution
of
united
states.i
--
i
conclude
the
essay.
and
of
course,
whenever
the
particular
government
in
power
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends,
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
to
abolish
it
and
thereupon
to
establish
a
new
government.
this
is
how
i
view
the
constitution.
this
is
the
only
prose
on
the
record.
that
was
--
that
was
before
the
first
questions
were
asked.
this
is
the
only
prose
that
fits
the
designation
of
the
attorney
general
and
this
is
the
only
prose
and
this
is
the
prose,
i'm
quite
willing
to
defend
because
as
i've
indicated
here,
the
italicized
words,
"whenever
government
becomes
destructive
of
these
ends,
it
is
the
right
of
the
people
to
alter
or
to
abolish
it
or
taken
verbatim
from
declaration
of
independence."
and
that,
i
suggest,
cannot
be
the
basis
for
any
kind
of
inquiry
by
subversive
affiliations
or
so-called
subversive
affiliations.
however,
there's
one
more
reference
here
and
that
is
a
committee
now
says
that
however
questionable
these
views
may
have
once
been,
we
now
concede
that
they
are
not
the
basis
of
our
decision.
there
--
there,
perhaps,
are
little
bit
more
libertarian,
a
little
bit
more
zealous
and
ordinarily
as
a
case.
but
what
is
--
but
we
have
set
these
aside.
but
then
they
go
right
on
to
say
that
my
views
about
resistance
to
court
decrees
in
some
circumstances
make
my
character
and
fitness
for
admission
to
the
bar
questionable.
this
you
will
see
at
pages
515
to
516.
mr.
george
anastaplo
the
record,
i'm
sorry.
the
court
--
i'm
sorry
--
at
the
bottom
page,
"the
committee
regarded
anastaplo's
views
bearing
upon
his
attitude
towards
established
authority
and
orderly
government
procedures
as
relevant
to
an
inquiry
into
his
character
and
fitness
for
admission
to
the
bar.
first,
anastaplo
declined
to
deny.
the
circumstances
might
exist
under
which
he
would
resist
by
force,
federal
or
state
officers
seeking
to
enforce
judgments
are
decreased
in
proceedings
against
impersonally
which
have
become
final
after
full
review
by
the
highest
court
having
jurisdiction.
anastaplo
testified,"
and
this
is
in
accurate
quotation,
"i
would
not
care
to
say,
there
might
not
be
instances
where
resistance
to
an
officer
of
the
law
executing
such
a
mandate
might
not
be
improper."
but
what
is
not
quite
accurate
is
the
interpretation.
and
for
this,
i
prefer
judge
bristol
at
page
528
which
i
think
conforms
to
the
record.
"the
per
curiam
opinion
clutches
its
strolls
by
even
referring
to
anastaplo's
views
and
resistance
to
a
court
decree
as
grounds
for
denying
admission
to
the
bar.
in
view
of
his
unequivocal
statement
that
he
would
resist
a
court
decree
only
under
circumstances
where
constitutional
government
has
been
subverted,
so
the
resistance
would
really
be
aimed
at
restoring
our
constitution
and
supporting
it
without
reservation."
surely,
this
is
no
war
against
the
constitution
as
per
curiam
opinion
implies.
and
i
must
say
again
that
if
a
court,
if
the
highest
court
of
the
land,
as
this
court
is,
were
to
hand
out
a
mandate
in
circumstances
where
there
either
demand
were
in
circumstances,
where
it's
clear,
the
constitutional
government
has
been
corrupted
and
destroyed,
then
one
is
obliged
to
resist
such
a
decree.
now,
i
know
of
no
instance
when
this
has
ever
happened
in
the
history
of
the
united
states.
i
do
not
foresee
it
happening
in
the
history
of
united
states.
but
if
sometime
the
judges
who
occupy
this
court
should
become
so
corrupted,
so
mistaken,
so
perverted
in
their
notion
about
what
their
duty
is
as
to
destroy
our
constitutional
government,
i
dare
say
we're
all
obliged
to
resist
such
a
decree.
we
--
we
have
examples
all
over
the
world
where
the
highest
courts
of
the
land
have
handed
down,
have
been
in
submission
of
such
tyranny.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i
--
i
was
very
qualified
--
i
tried
to
qualify
it,
sir,
mistaken
in
a
most
serious
fundamental
sense,
a
mistake
such
it
destroys
the
very
constitution
which
they
have
taken
in
oath
to
--
to
defend.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i've
already
said
that.
i
know
of
no
instance
in
which
this
would
happen.
this
has
happened
but
i
do
not
want
to
say
and
i
do
not
think
an
american
should
be
called
upon
to
say,
there
might
not
be
an
instance
in
which
a
tyrannical
act
of
government
should
not
be
resisted.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i
say
if
the
government
itself
is
tyrannical,
if
--
if
it's
an
instrument
of
tyranny,
if
it
is
a
--
if
it's
a
government
which
obviously
is
no
longer
supporting
the
constitution,
then
it
in
any
of
its
branches,
executive,
legislative
or
judicial
no
longer
deserve
support
of
the
people.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
and
i
have
thought
so
too
at
times.
but
i've
not
thought
there's
any
of
these
have
ever
justified
revolution
and
i
do
not
predict
that
happening,
but
i
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
perhaps,
the
--
mistaken
as
an
unfortunate
word
if
we
think
the
mistakes
are
minor
but
if
you
think
of
it
in
the
most
fundamental
sense,
then,
of
course,
one
would
have
it.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
well,
perhaps,
i
--
i
will
take
that
correction
and
--
and
say
that
--
but
in
those
instances,
a
court
would
say
hitler
dominates
is
a
court
didn't
deserve
no
respect
from
its
citizens
and
consequently
resistance,
proper
resistance
maybe
encountered.
this
is
what
declaration
of
independence
mean.
this
is
what
i've
always
defended
and
this
is
what
i
must
continue
to
defend.
now,
let
me
sum
up
by
saying
a
hearing
has
been
conducted
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
committee
is
obliged
to
act
according
to
the
evidence
which
they
have
found.
the
evidence
--
the
--
the
hearings
be
conducted
according
to
their
rules
with
their
standards
and
decision
should
follow
on
that
basis.
the
most
that
can
be
said
against
my
petition
is
that
the
refusal
to
answer
questions.
but
i
have
indicated
why
those
questions
have
to
be
evaluated
whether
refusal
has
to
be
not
analyzed
and
utmost
it
is
only
one
piece
of
evidence.
certainly,
i
would
add
that
the
defense
of
the
principles
of
declaration
of
independence
which
apply
when
tyrannical
government
threatens
to
extricate
the
rights
of
the
people,
certainly,
the
defense
of
those
principles
is
not
to
be
a
basis
for
exclusion.
i
would
suggest
then
that
the
question
is
whether
in
the
language
of
the
court
or
this
court
is
the
schware
case
whether
the
illinois
bar
authorities
could,
on
this
record
before
you,
reasonably
find
that
the
good
moral
character
has
not
been
shown.
thank
you.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i
think
i
can
finish
the
next
few
minutes.
as
of
the
service
point
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
it
was
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
--
the
original
application.
mr.
george
anastaplo
it
is
reprinted
on
page
15
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
george
anastaplo
it's
from
the
record
of
the
original
case.
mr.
george
anastaplo
no,
sir.
i
--
so
far
as
i
remember,
i
had
never
published
anything
prior
to
this
occasion.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i'm
sorry,
mr.
wines
is
simply
incorrect.
mr.
george
anastaplo
i
mean
he
had
a
mistaken
impression
of
what
happened
in
that
situation.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir,
in
september
1950.
mr.
george
anastaplo
september
1950,
before
the
first
hearing.
before
the
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
anastaplo
they
could
have
seen
that
but
there
is
nothing
published
that
i
know
of.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes.
mr.
george
anastaplo
it
is
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
sir,
it's
--
that's
the
--
the
only
writing
they
could
have
seen
and
--
but
i
should
all
frankly
say
i
have
never
thought
the
case
started
that
way.
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
sir.
the
question
in
the
questionnaire
is,
"state
what
you
consider
to
be
the
principles
underlying
the
constitution
of
united
states."
but
i
must
frankly
say,
i
don't
think
this
was
really
the
basis
of
the
inquiry.
i
mean
i'm
quite
willing
to
accept
the
attorney
general's
characterization
of
this
--
the
basis,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
fair
for
me
to
let
it
rest
it
there.
i
think
the
basis
of
the
inquiry
was
my
--
my
first
answer
to
the
question,
"do
you
think
a
member
of
the
communist
party
should
be
permitted
to
practice?"
i
still
think
so.
i
think
this
is
the
case
of
the
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
i
--
if
were
a
member
of
the
committee,
i
would
be
inclined
to
vote
for
either
one
knowing
nothing
else
about
them,
if
--
this
was
the
only
evidence
against
them.
but
if
the
attorney
general
must
point
to
something,
this
is
the
only
thing
he
pointed
to.
the
next
thing
i
can
point
out
is
that
on
a
service
point,
this
was
raised
in
the
attorney
general's
brief.
i
have
answered
it
at
length
in
my
reply
brief.
i
need
to
only
point
to
page
4
of
my
reply
brief
which
i
quote,
"i
had
written
to
the
clerk
my
present
plans
or
to
file
to
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
my
present
plans
where
to
file
my
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
next
week
or
so.
i
would
appreciate
learning
from
you
whether
the
court
has
authorized
anyone
to
receive
service
for
it
in
this
matter."
the
clerk
replied
to
me,
"as
far
as
this
office
is
informed,
the
court
has
not
authorized
anyone
to
receive
service.
it
would
be
my
suggestion,
however,
to
make
service
in
richard
h.
cain
in
this
matter
who
happened
to
be
the
secretary
of
the
committee."
i
do
not
rest
to
that.
i
served
the
committee,
chairman
of
the
committee,
secretary
of
the
committee,
chief
justices
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
and
i
also
indicated
to
each
of
them
that
i
was
serving
the
others
and
no
others.
they
had
no
grounds
for
suggesting
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
had
not
been
served.
i
mean
for
assuming
that's
turned
down
or
had
been
served,
they
knew
and
i
had
made
all
--
as
you
will
see
there
in
my
reply
brief,
i
had
exhausted
my
efforts
to
file
whom
to
serve.
the
next
point
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
i
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
well
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
yes,
thank
you.
mr.
george
anastaplo
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
that
the
--
as
to
the
effect
of
the
1954
opinion,
it
may
well
be,
as
mr.
wines
points
out.
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
judge
schaefer's
--
we
have
judge
schaefer's
and
judge
davis'
characterization
of
that
opinion
and
they
say,
which
i
quote
in
my
reply
brief
--
mr.
george
anastaplo
thank
you,
sir.
in
rebuttal
say
at
recess,
the
1954
opinion
of
the
court
may
be
read
in
different
number
of
ways.
i
was
going
to
quote
mr.
justice
schaefer's
characterization
of
it
which
is,
"our
prior
decision
determined
the
questions
concerning
the
applicant's
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
in
subversive
organizations
were
relevant.
and
we
must
now
determine
the
consequence
to
be
attached
as
refusal
to
answer
them.
i,
myself,
would
disagree
that
they
are
relevant
but
even
if
one
grants
that
they're
irrelevant,
the
problem
is
what
status
is
to
be
given
to
the
refusal
on
principle
to
answer
them
and
that
is
what
i
have
tried
to
address
myself
too.
secondly,
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
believe
that
section
ix,
if
upheld,
would
be
likely
to
burden
the
courts
of
illinois
or
the
committee
or
this
court.
i
would
hope
it
would
burden
them.
i
don't
think
so
because
you
and
i
both
know
that
applicants
are
far
too
much
interested
in
admission
to
the
bar
and
getting
on
to
careers
to
resist
such
questions
even
if
they
think
they're
improper.
and
the
--
the
spectacle
or
the
--
the
fear
of
this
kind
of
hearing
being
inflicted
upon
you
or
upon
the
committee
is
really
a
very
unrealistic
one.
it's
only
a
very
occasional
applicant
who
does
resist.
thirdly,
as
to
the
problem
of
obstruction
of
that
which
the
committee
was
--
was
obliged
to
look
into,
i
must
again
insist
upon
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
--
as
summarized
by
mr.
justice
schaefer
in
opening
his
dissent.
as
a
result
of
the
exhausted
hearings
before
the
committee,
we
now
have
far
more
information
as
to
the
moral
quality,
the
legal
capacity
and
the
political
views
of
this
applicant
and
this
ordinarily,
the
case.
and
all
i
asked
is
that
having
this
information,
the
committee
should
be
obliged
to
pass
upon
it
and
not
to
say
that
they
have
been
obstructed
or
kept
from
doing
so
by
my
attitude.
the
attitude,
itself,
i
grant,
is
one
more
piece
of
information
and
depending
upon
one's
own
views
of
these
matters,
the
piece
of
information
maybe
favorable
or
unfavorable
but
it's
certain
it
cannot
be
taken
simply
to
negate
everything
in
the
record.
finally,
let
me
just
say
that
i'm
grateful
to
the
court
for
this
opportunity
to
appear
before
them.
i'm
grateful
also
for
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
correction
of
my
notions
about
the
declaration
of
independence.
i
would
insist
still
that
any
tyrannical
action
emanating
from
whatever
source
is
in
principle
resistible
in
certain
circumstances.
that's
what
declaration
of
independence
holds
and
that's
what
i
think
this
court
would
surely
what
others
to
defend.
finally,
let
me
say
that
i'm
--
i
will
continue
to
hold
the
position
i
do,
both
on
the
declaration
of
independence
and
as
to
what
i
think
is
proper
for
the
character
and
fitness
of
the
american
bar.
if
--
i'd
--
i
suggested
the
remedies
to
be
given
in
this
case,
if,
however,
upon
looking
at
the
record,
considering
all
the
arguments,
you
think
that
my
position,
the
way
i
approach
this
matter,
kind
of
contribution
i
have
to
make
is
not
one,
it
is
to
the
good,
it
is
to
the
benefit
of
the
bar
and
i
think
it
would
be
--
i
would
be
grateful
that
you
say
so
and
that
you
give
me
clear
warning
to
stay
out
of
profession.
i'm
certainty
inclined
to
think
that
i
will
continue
in
a
manner
as
i
have
and
it
would
be
--
i
think,
i
would
also
be
obliged
to
say
that
it
would
be
your
duty
to
exclude
me
if
you
think
that
there's
really
any
basis
for
my
--
for
any
kind
of
notion
that
i
really
would
not
perform
adequately
as
lawyer.
thank
you.
