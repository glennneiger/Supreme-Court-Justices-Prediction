justice

frankfurter
are
there
religious
questions
before
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
rightly
infer
from
your
answer
that
you
mean
although
a
committee
asked
questions,
which
for
purposes
of
argument,
are
offensive
or
impertinent
in
a
legal
sense
but
later
withdraws
them
that
that
is
in
effect
but
in
legal
purposes
because
it
betrayed
their
state
of
mind
and
they
couldn't
redeem
to
have
rid
themselves
of
having
asked
those
questions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
the
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he's
given
all
those
penitentiary,
he
can't
subsequently
say
nolo
cons
paenitentiam.
i
can't
subsequently
say
no.
i
(inaudible)
i
was
wrong.
i
blot
that
out
of
my
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
certain
things
couldn't
be
blotted
out
of
a
jury's
mind,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
get
down
to
that.
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they'd
disclosed
the
state
of
mind
that
precluded
their
having
a
wiser
thought
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
to
say
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
you
were
unequivocally
advised
that
several
states
is
taking
the
answers
to
those
questions
of
vital
concern
to
their
disposition?is
that
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rephrase
it
your
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
you
were
not
aware
because
your
refusal
to
answer
these
questions
maybe
determinative
of
their
disposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
you
were
asked,
i
was
asking
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
there
is
no
suggestion,
is
there,
by
you
that
you
were
taken
by
surprise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
talking
at
--
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
totality
of
the
record.
are
you
suggesting
you
were
taken
by
surprise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
--
that
whatever
requirement
of
notice
there
may
be,
in
all
sorts
of
situations
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
you
did
not
have
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
corrupted
and
--
or
mistaken,
those
are
very
different
concepts
to
mine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
(inaudible)
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
--
is
a
mistake
--
does
a
mistake
arrive
out
of
a
tyrannical
attitude?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
very
high
minded
people
have
thought
or
think
that
this
government
--
that
this
court
has
handed
down
grossly
mistaking
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
my
difficulty
arises
from
coupling
mistaken
with
corruption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
call
(inaudible)
mistaken.
i
wouldn't
call
suppose
to
have
been
mistaken
except
in
a
very
free
willing
use
of
the
word
"mistaken".
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
a
minute
ago,
some
of
them,
he
did
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
would
you
be
give
enough
--
give
the
concrete
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
questions,
mr.
wines?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
a
matter
--
just
a
matter
of
curiosity.
is
this
same
body
also
the
examining
body?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
body
on
--
on
recommending
admission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
--
what
you
are
saying,
in
my
understanding,
relationship
of
the
commissioners
to
the
court,
what
you're
saying
is
that
all
--
they
cannot
say
you
will
be
denied
admission
to
the
bar
because,
as
i
understand
on
both
of
you,
instead
only
the
supreme
court
can
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
since
the
supreme
court
doubtless
have
bound
to
be
heavily
influenced
by
the
recommendation
or
the
report
of
these
permissions,
i
should
say
think
that
quite
within
their
competence
to
say
that
this
is
serious
business
and
it
might
have
easily
consequences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
the
prisoners
case
is
important
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
prisoners
case
is
the
importance
of
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
brennan's
question
is
(inaudible)
your
last
statement,
your
answer
there
left
us
even
confuse.
i
understood
you
without
this
erroneous
--
i
mean
conclude
quick
a
conclusion
that
this
isn't
advisory
body
that
does
not
in
and
of
itself
issues
certificate
of
admission
because
a
fellow
has
to
have
some
piece
of
paper,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
concrete
question
that
evidently
you're
not
sure
about
it,
are
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
issued
a
certificate
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unbelievably
or
it
must
have
come
from
the
supreme
court
however
automatically
or
informed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
signed
by
the
chief
justice
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
they
do
have
power
of
admission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
presided
that
meeting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
the
court
that
does
it.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
--
you're
saying
in
effect
that
as
to
favorable
action
by
this
committee,
he
passed
his
examination,
is
that
a
written
examination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
bar
examination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
he
gets
to
the
committee
on
character,
as
we
call
it,
i
don't
know
what
they
call
it
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
passed
the
bar
examination,
then
he
goes
before
the
committee
on
character
(inaudible)
committee
in
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
right?
this
committee
of
yours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
pass
on
it
favorably,
then
the
practice
thereafter
is
substantially
like
the
practice
that
you
have
often
witnessed
in
this
court
when
we
admit
of
mass
recommendation
by
john
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
he
say
he
will
be
admitted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
to
go
before
the
court
to
be
formally
admitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
rule
is
inconsistent
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
people
--
if
an
admission
is
new
where
you're
standing,
someone
(inaudible)
member
of
this
court
could
suggest
to
the
chief
justice
that
he
would
like
to
have
that
admission
postpone
until
he
had
a
chance
to
state
reasons
for
asking
for
such
performance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there
is
statute
and
nothing
in
print
but
it's
inherent
in
the
process
of
admission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
they
saw
you
they
were
sure
that
that
must
have
been
a
misidentification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all
events,
mr.
wines,
in
this
case,
we
haven't
got
the
case
of
a
man
who
was
favorably
reported
by
the
committee
and
then
something
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
got
a
case
where
he
was
denied
the
recommendation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
requisite
for
subsequent
consideration,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
don't
we
go
under
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
assume
the
committee
doesn't.
i
assumed
that
justice
in
this
court
that
we
have
no
committee
wherein
people
are
moved.
what
i
will
say
admissions
will
be
granted
only
upon
oral
motion
by
a
member
of
the
bar
in
open
court
and
upon
the
assurance
the
he
is
satisfied
that
the
applicant
posses
with
the
necessarily
qualification.
it's
new
to
me
that
automatically,
this
court,
speaking
through
the
chief
justice,
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
say
"well,
we
consider
mr.
jones'
case
in
the
meantime
and
--
and
decide
next
monday
whether
we'll
admit
him."
i
didn't
suppose
that
the
motion
of
the
member
of
the
bar
standing
where
you
are
standing
automatically
that
if
we
could
get
a
mandamus
against
this
court,
that
he
could
get
a
mandamus
make
admitted.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
say
we
have
to
follow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
rules
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
usually
are
not
in
writing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
how
--
how
did
they
come
into
life?
what's
--
when
did
you
--
as
i
understood
you,
in
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question,
this
was
something
you
submitted
to
the
committee
of
inquiry,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
what
stage
of
the
inquiry
was
that
submission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
a
member
of
the
committee
would
have
seen
it
before
they
saw
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
but
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
thought
this
piece
of
writing
before
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
you
were
questioned,
is
that
right?
