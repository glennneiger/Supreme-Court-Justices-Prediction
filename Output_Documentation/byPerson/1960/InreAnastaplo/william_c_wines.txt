mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
begin
by
remarking
on
the
question
with
which
mr.
anastaplo
concluded
his
presentation.
the
question
whether
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
or
anyone
else
could
reasonably
find
on
this
record
that
mr.
anastaplo
is
not
of
a
character
and
fitness
to
qualify
him
for
the
bar
is
not
presented
on
this
case
because
no
member
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
so
found
or
said
that
he's
so
found.
the
attorney
general
makes
no
such
point.
i
can
make
clear
the
restricted
basis
and
therefore,
the
limited
scope
of
the
questions
presented
by
this
case
if
i
may
make
an
extremely
brief
chronicle
of
what
we
conceived
to
be
the
salient
facts
in
the
case.
i
should
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
through
a
misunderstanding
that
can't
possibly
be
have
--
have
been
due
to
anything
more
sinister,
devious
or
subversive
than
inexperience.
mr.
anastaplo
did
not
serve
the
attorney
general
with
the
petition
for
the
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
case.
the
first
intelligence
that
the
attorney
general
or
the
highest
chief
of
this
appeal
section
have,
the
petition
had
been
filed
or
that
there
was
such
a
case
in
this
court
was
when
he
received
the
clerk's
telegram
saying
that
their
writ
had
been
granted.
what
happened
was
that
mr.
anastaplo,
i'm
sure
in
the
utmost
good
faith,
did
serve
the
chicago
bar
association
or
its
president
or
committees,
did
serve
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
but
neither
of
those
bodies
transmitted
the
petition
to
us
because
neither
of
them
suppose
that
he
hadn't
serve
the
attorney
general
and
that's
why
no
answer
was
filed
to
the
petition
in
this
case.
with
that
explanation,
i
should
now
like
to
show
the
court
the
really
limited
scope
of
the
questions
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
anastaplo
granted
--
graduated
from
the
university
of
chicago,
college
of
law
in
the
year
1950,
i
believe,
and
i
think
i
should
add
though
he's
--
he
can
properly
that
he
graduated
with
distinction
from
that
institution
and
that
appears
in
the
record
or
i
wouldn't
mention
it.
he
successfully
passed
the
illinois
bar
examination.
he
appeared
before
the
committee
on
character
and
fitness
which
is
composed
of
members
of
the
chicago
bar
association.
mr.
anastaplo,
having
written
on
the
subject
of
revolution,
language
that
i
don't
think
intrinsically
or
per
se
suggest
--
i
--
may
i
withdraw
that,
intrinsically
or
per
se
declares
any
thoughts
more
subversive
than
those
embodied
in
the
declaration
of
independence
was
asked
some
questions
as
to
what
he
meant
by
these
writings.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
--
on
--
on
the
application,
i'm
quite
sure
they
didn't.
and
where
the
information
came
from,
i
do
not
know.
i
do
know
that
he
was
asked
these
questions.
he
declined
to
answer
those
questions,
not
suggesting
any
privilege
against
self-incrimination
but
asserting
what
he
conceived
to
be
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
stemming
from
the
fourteenth
amendment's
guarantee
of
the
freedom
of
speech,
political
assembly
and
possibly
other
first
amendment'
rights.
he
was
then
asked,
i
think
in
those
first
hearings,
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
he
declined
to
answer
that
question,
again,
asserting
what
he
conceived
to
be
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
in
silence
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
no
claim
that
a
truthful
answer
would
tend
to
incriminate.
he
was
then
asked
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
he
made
a
similar
response.
and
he
was
then
asked
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
silver
shirts,
a
fascist
organization.
and
he
made
a
similar
response.
he
was
then
asked
whether
he
was
a
member
of
any
association
on
the
attorney
general's
list
of
subversive
organizations
and
he
made
a
similar
response.
somebody
asked
him,
we
make
no
point
of
the
fact.
we
think
the
question
was
improper
but
absolutely
innocuous
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
republican
or
democratic
party.
that
question
was
obviously
intended
simply
to
find
out
what
kind
of
questions
he
thought
he
ought
to
be
asked
not
with
anyone
would
qualify
or
disqualify
him
for
any
answer
that
he
might
make.
and
he
was
asked
those
questions
about
his
memberships
--
i
mean
possible
memberships
in
subversive
organizations.
he
was
then
asked
a
different
type
of
question.
he
was
asked
many
questions
as
to
his
beliefs,
his
views
or
opinions
which,
of
course,
are
very
different
things
from
memberships
and
affiliations
on
such
topics
as
the
"right
of
revolution‚Äù.
some
of
these
questions
he
declined
to
answer.
some
of
them
he
answered.
some
of
them,
i
can
only
say
he
certainly
responded
to
them
but
whether
he
answered
them
is
something
else
i
can't.
he
was
asked
a
question
in
reaction,
if
not
an
answer
to
which
he
expatiated.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
he
did,
he
said
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
he
said
that
his
views,
as
i
recall
them,
i
can't
just
put
my
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
way
to
reduce
about
revolution.
yes,
he
said
in
certain
places
that
they
were
similar
to
those
--
that
find
utterance
in
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
writings
or
speeches
of
abraham
lincoln.
now,
he
was
denied.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
--
i
heard,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
i
understood
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
i'm
anxious
not
to
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
to
ask
him
about
communist
affiliations?
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
sir,
that's
correct
and
that
is
correct.
it
was
his
rights
which
i
conceive
to
be
ambiguous,
not
to
per
se
seditious
or
subversive
that
prompted
the
questions
as
to
his
possible
membership
in
subversive
organizations.
mr.
william
c.
wines
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
able
to
recall
into
which
hearings
he
was
asked
and
which
questions.
i
simply
haven't
mastered
the
record
with
respect
to
the
dates
on
and
--
and
i
--
i
can
look
it
up
and
give
your
honor
a
memorandum
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
but
i
don't
want
to
mislead
your
honor.
now,
he
was
denied
a
certificate
and
he
sought
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
now,
i
find
the
tenure
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
argument
such
that
i
think
i
have
to
take
two
and
a
half
or
three
minutes
if
necessary
to
explain,
your
honor,
the
extremely
limit
and
restricted
function
of
the
committee
or
commissioners
on
character
and
fitness
in
--
in
illinois.
that
committee
does
not
have
anything
like
the
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
authority
of
an
administrating
agency
of
a
lower
court
or
judicial
tribunal
of
a
master
and
chancellory,
referee
or
commissioner,
certainly,
has
no
such
prerogatives
as
a
jury.
its
functions
are
advisory.
its
counsel
appears
at
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
as
friends
of
the
court.
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
exercises
all
of
the
faculties
of
illinois
sovereignty
with
respect
to
the
admission
to
the
bar.
we
have
no
statutory
regulation
on
this
subject
at
all.
our
only
generic
texts
are
the
rules
of
the
court.
the
court's
functionaries
give
the
bar
examination,
collect
the
fees,
grade
the
papers
and
anything
to
bar,
it
makes
no
difference
what
the
commissioners
say.
their
only
advisory,
there
is
no
such
rule
that
they
won't
be
disturbed
unless
they
are
clean
--
clearly
erroneous
or
--
or
if
their
--
if
their
substantial
support
in
the
evidence
or
the
rule
that
illinois
does
apply
in
appeals
from
administrative
agencies.
they
will
be
set
aside
only
if
they're
against
the
manifest
weight
of
the
evidence.
they
are
advisory.
each
justice
gives
them
the
consideration
that
he
deems
the
(inaudible)
but
that's
not
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
no.
oh,
no,
your
honors.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
--
the
bar
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
they
serve
without
compensation.
bar
examiners
are
compensated.
it's
not
the
same
at
all.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
every
case.
for
the
hearing,
they
sit
a
subcommittee
but
my
understanding
is
that
all
of
the
--
their
recommendations
come
before
a
--
a
larger
--
a
larger
committee.
now,
counsel
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
sir.
they
are
--
they
are
officers
of
the
bar.
yes,
i
think
they
are
appointed
by
the
supreme
court
but
they
are
appointed
from
the
membership
of
the
bar
association.
now,
on
this
matter
of
warning,
i
will
show
your
honors
if
--
if,
in
just
a
moment,
the
chief
justice
gives
me
permission
to
read
three
passages,
none
a
hundred
--
exceeding
a
hundred
words
in
lengthy
opinion.
the
petitioner
was
told
not
warn
but
told
that
he
wouldn't
be
admitted
unless
he
answered
the
question
but
not
in
member
of
the
committee
because
no
member
of
the
committee
has
the
slightest
authority
to
give
that
assurance.
they
are
advisers.
they
are
not
like
a
district
judge
who
can
say
answer
that
question
or
i
will
send
you
to
jail
or
if
you're
a
plaintiff,
"answer
that
question
or
i
won't
send
you
to
jail
but
i
will
dismiss
your
suit
with
prejudice."
they
have
no
more
authority
to
advice
him
than
the
--
than
the
court
reporter
taking
the
--
the
transcript.
they
can
only
--
only
--
the
only
thing
any
commissioner,
the
utmost
he
can
do
and
he
can't
do
this
without
prejudging
the
case,
is
to
tell
the
applicant
what
his
failure
to
answer
--
what
effect
his
failure
to
answer
will
have
on
the
mind
of
that
particular
commissioner,
so
i
will
concede
that
he
not
only
wasn't
warned
but
couldn't
have
been
warned
except
in
an
advisory
or
a
way
by
any
commissioner.
the
advice
might
have
been
amicable,
hostile
or
neutral
but
advice
it
would
be
warning
and
it
could
not
be.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
all.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
but
that's
what
they
did
say
in
all
virtual
effect.
now,
when
petitioner
first
met
with
refusal
for
--
of
admission
of
the
hands
of
this
committee,
he
sought
review,
it's
not
an
appeal.
he
sought
review
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
of
denial
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
handed
down
an
opinion.
the
petitioner
does
print
in
the
record,
he
doesn't
make
it
an
appendix
to
a
petition
but
we
do
in
our
brief.
and
that
case
was
decided
on
september
23rd,
1954,
the
year
of
some
importance
in
the
case
of
in
re
anastaplo
prejudice
in
appendix
in
full
to
our
blue
covered
brief.
and
here
is
what
the
supreme
court
told
him,
not
a
commissioner
or
advisory
but
told
him
on
september
--
on
september
23rd,
1954,
i
know
take
advantage
of
the
chief
justice's
leave
to
rerun
short
extra.
mr.
william
c.
wines
from
page
--
i'm
reading
it
from
page
14
of
our
brief
and
it
also
appears
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
and
in
the
record.
"under
any
hypothesis,
therefore,
questions
as
to
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
known
subversive
front
organizations
were
relevant
to
the
inquiry
into
petitioner's
fitness
for
admission
to
the
bar.
his
refusal
to
answer
questions
has
prevented
the
committee
from
inquiring
fully
into
his
general
fitness
and
good
citizenship
and
just
applies
their
refusal
to
issue
a
certificate."
i'll
get
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
that,
your
honors,
in
due
time
but
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
its
clarity.
he
was
told
on
september
23rd,
1954
that
so
far
as
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
concerned,
he
would
not
be
admitted
until
he
answered
questions
about
his
memberships
and
affiliations,
it's
not
one
word
about
his
views,
opinions
or
beliefs.
now,
i
mentioned
only
for
the
purposes
of
coherence
of
the
narrative
and
to
show
petitioner's
attitude
and
without
implying
any
intimation
on
the
part
of
your
honors.
petitioner
sought
what
was
denied
certiorari.
i
don't
suggest
that
that
imports
your
honors'
adjudication.
i
simply
want
to
show
that
petitioner
has
exhausted
such
as
we
mentioned
it
in
the
prisoners
case
to
show
what
majors
he
has
taken.
after
this
case
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
what?
mr.
william
c.
wines
it's
of
no
importance
in
this
case.
i
--
and
i
--
and
i
don't
suggest
that
it
is.
now,
after
your
honors
have
decided
the
schware
and
konigsberg
cases,
petitioner
again
sought
a
certificate
from
the
illinois
committee
on
character
and
fitness
was
again
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
oh,
yes.
the
first
--
the
first
in
re
anastaplo
was
in
1954.
your
honors
decided
the
konigsberg
case
in
1957.
after
that
decision,
petitioner
again
sought
a
certificate
from
the
committee
was
again
denied.
again,
presented
the
matter
to
the
supreme
court.
and
that
supreme
court
entered
an
order
which
is
quoted
in
full
on
pages
15
and
16
of
our
blue
covered
brief
remitting
the
case."
we
can't
really
say
remanding
because
there
was
no
judgment
to
be
appealed
but
remitting
the
case
to
the
committee
for
further
consideration
in
the
light
of
schware,
konigsberg
and
the
order.
that
order
does
say
the
principle
question
presented
by
the
petition
for
rehearing
concerns
a
significant
simply
applicant's
reviews
as
to
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
in
the
light
of
konigsberg
and
yates
and
so
on.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
committee
should
have
allowed
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
heard
evidence
on
these
matters
and
the
committee
has
requested
to
do
so
and
to
report
the
evidence
and
its
conclusions."
now,
petitioner
again
steadfastly
declined
the
answer
of
these
questions.
now,
i
want
to
make
a
difference,
which
i
know
was
already
apparent
to
every
member
of
the
court.
i
want
the
court
to
know
that
i
recognize
this,
between
questions
as
to
membership
or
affiliations
in
any
kind
of
an
organization
and
questions
as
to
views,
opinions
or
beliefs
of
any
kind,
membership
or
affiliation
maybe
secret
in
the
sense
that
it's
kept,
cleansed,
surreptitious,
but
it
requires
some
kind
of
communication
can
never
be
wholly
private
or
completely
undisclosed,
either
requires
an
oral
utterance,
say
a
--
a
writing
of
some
kind
or
such
manual
or
semi
forces
raising
a
hand
of
taking
oath
of
admission
to
the
bar
of
this
court
or
in
salute
to
a
fastest
governmental
or
standing
with
the
head
bowed
or
bowing
of
the
knee
or
some
kind
of
overactivity
and
communication
so
there
is
no
privacy
in
the
absolute
sense.
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
said,
"belief
in
its
nature
is
absolute"
though
there
maybe
secrecy
about
memberships
or
affiliations.
now,
after
further
hearings,
the
subcommittee
by
a
vote
of,
i
think,
16-to-11
again
vote
not
to
grant
--
to
deny,
if
i
say
it
that
way,
a
certificate
of
character
and
fitness.
i
have
to
mention
only
for
the
purpose
of
pointing
out
to
complete
irrelevance
to
two
members
of
the
committee
did
ask
the
petitioner
whether
he
had
such
religious
prepossessions,
convictions
or
lack
of
convictions
as
what
either
inhibiting
from
taking
an
oath
or
relieve
him
from
any
sense
of
obligation.
one
of
those
commissioners
since
after
looking
up
the
law
decided
that
the
question
was
improper
the
third
--
the
other
commissioner
still
as
of
the
opinion
that
the
question
was
proper
but
he's
the
only
one,
no
member
of
the
supreme
court
says
it
is.
now,
the
other
commissioner
say
it
is
and
the
attorney
general
wants
to
make
it
very
clear
that
in
the
illinois,
you
can
always
take
an
affirmation
if
you
have
the
pains
and
penalties
of
perjury,
if
you
have
some
scruples
against
taking
an
oath.
so
the
question
of
any
inquiry
into
petitioner's
religious
beliefs
is
just
not
in
this
record
at
all.
i
mean
this
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
quite
sure
the
minority
could
have
requested
a
review
but
i
know
of
no
case
for
a
minority
has
done
so
and
in
fact,
i
knew
of
no
other
cases.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
no,
the
court
wouldn't
take
any
step
on
it
if
--
if
nobody
ask
it
to
maybe
to
a
stranger
for
the
record
a
member
of
the
bar
could
go
in
and
say,
"look,
it
appears
that
a
man
is
being
admitted
here
who's
a
counterfeiter
or
something
in
that
sort".
but
ordinarily,
these
hearings
before
the
character
and
fitness
committee
are
brief
and
they
do
not
result
in
any
debates
of
any
kind.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
sir,
your
honor,
i
can't
say
that
it
would.
i
say
that
the
probability
--
i
--
no
--
i
don't
know.
it
wouldn't
have
automatically,
no.
not
automatically,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
does
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i'm
sure.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
they
do.
mr.
william
c.
wines
whatever
--
anything
that
i've
said
that
in
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
i
have
inadvertently
mislead,
your
honors
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
i
would
like
to
correct
and
tell
your
honors
what
happens
because
i
am
much
more
anxious
to
be
correctly
understood
than
anything
else
in
this
case.
there
is
a
piece
of
paper
that
is
normally
given
by
the
committee
sent
to
the
clerk.
i
don't
even
remember
whether
the
application
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor,
by
the
committee,
not
by
just
any
member
of
the
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
--
no,
your
honor.
i
have
not
said
so.
i
have
said
that
they
issue
the
paper
but
i
have
not
said
that
the
paper
carries
with
it
the
consequence
of
admission.
mr.
william
c.
wines
normally,
it
goes
to
the
clerk.
mr.
william
c.
wines
makes
a
record
of
it
and
i'm
sure
that
a
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
not
until
the
class
comes
down.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
class
of
all
those
who
were
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar
and
appear
it
used
to
be
in
the
supreme
court
room.
the
room
is
now
not
large
enough.
they
go
across
the
street
to
a
building
that
we
call
the
centennial
building.
a
motion
is
made
for
their
admission.
mr.
william
c.
wines
all
of
the
members
of
the
court
(inaudible).
mr.
william
c.
wines
it's
the
court
that
admits
to
the
bar.
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
your
honor
please,
i'd
like
to
explain.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
certificate
of
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
thay
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
turned
down
the
application
of
a
man
who
admitted
that
he
was
at
one
time
a
communist
and
now
says
that
he
is
degenerated.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
william
c.
wines
after
the
committee
had
given
him
an
unfavorable
report.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
knew
of
no
case
in
which
the
supreme
court
has
either
refused
or
been
asked
by
anyone
including
a
stranger
to
the
proceedings
such
as
a
citizen
or
a
taxpayer
or
even
a
lunatic.
i
know
of
no
case,
but
i
don't
say
there
hasn't
been
one,
where
anyone
has
ever
gone
to
the
court
and
objected
to
the
admission
to
the
bar
of
a
person
who
had
received
a
favorable
report.
but
i
do
know
this
and
i
can
assure
your
honors
that
no
person
--
that
the
--
that
the
committee
has
no
more
authority
to
admit
a
person
to
the
bar
of
illinois.
and
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
doesn't
have
conclusion,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
do.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
the
practice.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
appear
in
a
large
body.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
can
answer
that
unequivocally,
not
that
i
know
of,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
entirely
in
the
rules
of
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
they
are
printed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
think
they're
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
see
what
mr.
anastaplo's
kindness
that
they
are
at
page
7
of
the
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
anastaplo's.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
sir,
he
takes
exactly
the
same
examination
and
goes
through
exactly
the
same
process
as
if
he
had
graduated
from
any
other
law
school
in
the
country
that's
accredited
or
had
studied
in
an
office
which
is
still
permissible
under
the
illinois
rule
and
sometimes
definite.
mr.
william
c.
wines
you
mean
in
the
ordinary
case?
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
the
ordinary
case,
there
is
no
specific
review
by
the
court
or
any
member
thereof
of
the
papers
of
any
applicant
so
far
as
i
know
and
i
think
i
would
know
if
there
were.
mr.

no,
it's
entirely

you
mean
the
bar
examination?
mr.

it's
entirely
written.
mr.

character

there
is
a
difference.
mr.

mr.

exactly.
mr.

mr.

not
that
i
know

mr.

there
is
no

the
subject
at

the

mr.

no.
mr.
william

yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
the
opinion
in
the
case
of
in
re
anastaplo
decided
in
1954.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
was
denied
admission.
mr.
william
c.
wines
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
says
that
he
shall
be
entitled
to
admission
to
the
bar.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
understand
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
does,
he
does.
and
i
am
quite
certain
that
a
minority
of
the
committee
could
elicit
a
consideration
by
the
court
if
they
wanted
to
no
matter
what
the
rule
says,
though
i
know
of
no
case
where
it's
happened.
mr.

no.none.
mr.

it
is
not.
mr.

i
should
certain
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
have
in
mind
the
text
of
your
--
of
your
honors
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
know
that
there
are
some
states
where
that
dispenses
with

--
i
mean
i
understand
that
there
are
some
states
were
that
dispenses
with
bar
examinations.
i
do
not
know
whether
any
of
those
states
also
dispense
where
they
a
--
an
inquiring
into
character,
i'm
not
informed
on
the
subject
as
to
any
state
in
the
(voice

--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
when
you
--
you
have
to
file
a
written
application
and
you
are
supposed
to
have
the
endorsement
of
three
members
of
the
bar
of
illinois.
i
have
frequently
--
every
class,
some
young
lawyer
asks
me
to
give
him
such
an
endorsement
and
that's
how
i
happened
to
know
about
it.
and
there
are
some
questions
on
that,
i
think,
as
to
when
he
was
born
and
to
list
his
occupations.
i
know
mr.
anastaplo
can
tell
you
better
than
i
and
i'm
sure
he
will
tell
you
reliably.
there
is
this
blank
but
so
far
as
it
--
so
far
as
they're
being
any
questions
on
there
about
whether
he
is
a
member
of
a
subversive
organization,
there
are
not
and
i
do
know
when
i
was
admitted
to
the
bar
which
was
in
1932.
every
applicant
was
asked
if
he'd
ever
been
arrest
--
when
asked
anything
about
communism
in
1932
but
he
was
asked,
if
he
had
ever
been
arrested
for
a
crime
and
i
was
asked
that
question
and
i
had
to
tell
them
the
true
case
of
mistaken
identity
for
i
was
on
my
way
home.
i'm
in
a
hurry.
i
was
arrested
for
a
burglary
and
they
ask
me
[laughs]
not
a
word
about
communism
but
a
lot
about
burglary.
mr.
william
c.
wines
[laughs]
and
--
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
they
--
they
reached
that
--
they
reached
that
conclusion
[laughter]
and
i
--
and
i
was
--
i
was
admitted
to
the
--
i
was
admitted
to
the
bar
and
i'm
--
i
still
am.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
intend
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
didn't
understanding
to
ask
me
a
question
of
law.
he
asked
me
--
maybe
misunderstood
him.
i
understood
him
to
ask
me
whether
this
was
not
the
case
of
a
man
who
had
been
denied
the
certificate
by
this
committee
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
and
it
is
such
a
case.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
--
i
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
i
don't
understand
what
it
is
your
honor
wants.
i
mean
if
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
that
i
can
answer.
we
do
not
have.
i
didn't
understand
your
honors.
mr.
william
c.
wines
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
your
honors,
it's
awfully
difficult
for
me
to
tell
your
honors
what
your
honors
mean
by
your
rule
governing
admission
to
the
bar
or
this
court
when
i
haven't
studied
or
thought
of
the
question
until
this
--
this
afternoon.
i
do
say
the
petitioner
does
not
state
the
constitutionality
of
this
rule
and
that
i
do
know
from
the
practice
of
the
court
and
from
the
case
of
in
re
debs
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
is
very
important.
mr.
william
c.
wines
in
re
debs.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
held
that
the
admission
of
lawyers
to
the
bar
or
under
the
constitution
is
a
function
of
the
supreme
court
alone
and
that
the
legislature
cannot
do
it.
it's
a
function
of
the
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
in
the
footnote.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it's
cited
in
the
footnote
on
page
17,
your
honor.
but
the
question
that's
presented
and
the
only
question
that's
presented
by
this
case
is
whether,
i
should
like
to
read
the
language
of
the
opinion
that
is
appealed
from
now
that
presents
the
only
question
that
we
think
is
--
arises
on
this
record.
and
i
am
reading
that
from
page
17
of
this
brief.
the
majority
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
and
i
quote,
"the
petitioner's,"
beginning
the
quote
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
17.
mr.
william
c.
wines
"refusal
to
answer
questions
as
the
petitioner's
membership
in
the
communist
party,"
i
should
say
that's
communist
party
and
others
subversive
organizations,
"has
prevented
the
committee
from
inquiring
fully
into
his
general
fitness
and
good
citizenship
and
justifies
their
refusal
to
issue
a
certificate."
in
other
words,
the
only
ground
that
the
supreme
court
ultimately
gave
for
refusing
petitioner's
admission
was
that
he
declined
to
answer
questions
as
to
his
possible
membership
in
subversive
organizations.
and
the
question
is
whether
illinois
may
constitutionally
require
an
applicant
to
answer
such
a
question.
now,
petitioner
seems
to
disclaim
in
his
oral
argument
any
contention
that
actual
membership
in
the
communist
party
or
other
subversive
organization,
even
if
proved
or
admitted,
would
disqualify
him.
but
in
his
brief,
he
seems
to
make
that
contention
because
he
says
that
even
--
that
the
communist
party
and
the
ku
klux
klan
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
constitution.
i
don't
know
what
he
means
by
that.
but
it
seems
to
indicate
that
even
admitted
membership
in
those
organizations
wouldn't
disqualify
him.
however,
in
our
brief
we
do
argue.
first,
that
membership
in
the
communist
party,
if
i
may
explain,
word
per
se
be
a
valid
ground
for
disqualifying
petitioner
from
admission
to
the
bar.
we
think
it
suffices
to
cite
your
honors'
decision
in
the
dennis
case
holding
that
membership,
which
i
entered,
of
its
criminal
purposes
in
that
party
is
a
federal
felony.
we
also
point
out
that
although
the
communist
party
doesn't,
so
far
as
i
know
at
the
moment,
profess
any
anti-racial
discriminations,
the
silver
shirts
and
the
ku
klux
klan
do.
they
have
racial
defamation
and
vilification
for
one
of
their
objectives.
and
illinois
punishes
racial
defamation
and
vilification
under
a
statute
that
your
honors
held
constitutional
in
the
white
circle
case,
beauharnais
against
illinois.
and
we
say
that
membership
that
--
in
an
organization,
i
mean
always,
which
i
entered,
it
has,
for
its
object,
the
violation
of
a
criminal
statute
of
the
state
of
illinois
is
ground
for
disqualification
from
membership
in
the
illinois
bar.
also,
illinois
punishes
as
murder
not
only
those
who
actively
participate
in
an
actively
plotted
a
killing
but
who
belong
to
an
organization
knowing
that
it
has
murder
for
its
object
if
murder
results
even
though
they
neither
participated
in
nor
plotted
the
particular
murder.
that
was
held
in
the
haymarket
riot
case
and
while
there
has
been
much
criticism
of
that
case
on
the
ground
that
the
defendants
may
not
have
been
proved
guilty
and
didn't
get
a
fair
trial.
we
know
of
no
dissent,
responsible
dissent,
judicial,
academic
or
any
other
kind
or
dissents
from
the
major
premise
that
those
who
are
guilty
of
abandon
that
they
know
has
murder
for
its
object
are
guilty
of
murder
if
murder
results
from
their
confederation.
now,
the
next
question
arises
is
if
membership
in
anyone
of
these
three
organizations
as
a
ground
for
disqualification,
may
we
ask
an
applicant.
i
should
think,
your
honor,
that
if
we're
right
that
if
the
--
an
affirmative
and
unexplained,
i
want
to
repeat,
unexplained
answer
would
disqualify
for
admission,
then
we
must
have
the
right
to
ask
the
question.
i
do
think
this
of
--
if
an
applicant
says,
"yes,
yes,
i'm
a
member
of
the
communist
party."
we
can't
stop
there.
we
have
to
say,
"do
you
have
an
explanation?"
"oh,
yes,
i
can
tell
you,
this
is
a
closed
hearing.
i
am
an
agent
for
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
they
know
all
about
my
membership
in
the
communist
party.
here
are
my
credentials.
yes,
i
am
writing
an
expos√©.
i
can
tell
you
in
confidence
or
a
doctor's
thesis
in
such
and
such
university."
i
--
maybe
the
committee
would
then
think
that
the
man
was
a
patriot,
not
a
potential
traitor
and
--
or
maybe
the
supreme
court
would
so
think
and
happily
admit
him.
it's
just
barely
imaginable
from
the
immigration
cases
or
hardly
in
the
case
of
one
who
had
graduated
from
a
law
school
that
he
might
admit
membership,
but
not
in
a
communist
party,
at
least
in
some
other
subversive
organization,
but
convince
the
committee
that
he
was
a
version
of
any
knowledge
of
its
criminal
purposes
even
though
he
did
know
that
it
held
some
extremely
latitudinarian
social
views.
now,
petitioner
seems
to
think,
and
this
is
where
i
find
so
much
difficulty
in
filing,
that
there
is
at
stake
in
this
case,
some,
maybe,
principle
of
constitutional
treatment.
if
he
disclaims,
as
i
understood
him
to
disclaim,
that
as
any
contention
that
actual
membership
were
proved
to
remit
him
in
communist
party
disqualifies
him.
i
would
not
--
this
means
the
contention
that
it
wouldn't
disqualify
him,
then
i
don't
see
much
substance
for
the
contention
that
we
can't
ask
him.
now,
we
take
this
position
very
strongly
and
emphatically
in
our
brief
that
the
rule
in
illinois
is
that
no
amount
of
overwhelming
and
wholly
uncontradicted
proof
of
good
character
and
will
dispatch
with
simple
answers
to
simple
questions
and
we
say
that
for
each
of
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place
in
any
kind
of
judicial
proceedings,
saving
only
a
question
of
privilege
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination
and
not
communication
between
the
husband
and
wife,
attorney
and
client,
penitent
and
confessing
--
and
--
and
confessor,
you
can
ask
any
party
to
any
kind
of
a
judicial
or
quasi-judicial
proceeding
any
question
that's
relevant.
now,
we
put
the
case.
there
were
many
cases
in
the
laws
of
all
the
states
where
the
personal
oath
as
to
matters
of
that
of
an
applicant
for
a
privilege
is
required
and
that's
true
even
though
the
privileges
once
that
--
one
that
once
all
constitutional
requirements
are
met
(inaudible)
is
--
is
entitled
to
the
protection
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
for
example,
in
illinois,
if
you
want
to
vote
and
certainly
if
your
vote
is
challenged
but
even
if
it
isn't,
you
have
to
take
an
oath
that
you're
21
years
old,
that
you
lived
in
the
state
a
year,
the
county
90
days,
in
the
precinct
30
days.
it
won't
do
to
decline
to
take
that
oath
but
offer
to
bring
in
the
affidavit
of
50
people
who
know
that
you
were
born
in
the
home
where
you're
now
living
and
have
lived
their
for
50
years.
and
if
you
want
a
marriage
license,
you
will
have
to
make
an
oath
that
you
are
not
married,
although
ordinarily,
there's
a
presumption
of
innocence.
you
can't
just
indict
a
man
for
bigamy
and
say
"prove
that
you
don't
have
two
wives".
but
until
you
take
that
oath,
you
don't
get
that
license.
you
can't
bring
in
50
neighbors
who
know
that
you
never
lived
with
a
woman
as
your
wife,
introduced
her
as
your
wife.
nobody
ever
heard
you
--
never
heard
that
you
were
married.
there
were
many
such
cases
where
you
have
to
make
a
personal
oath.
now,
it's
true
that
in
mr.
anastaplo's
case,
after
compiling
a
record
of
these
dimensions,
no
member
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
able
to
reach
an
affirmative
conclusion
that
mr.
anastaplo
is
a
communist.
certainly,
the
attorney
general
doesn't
think
he
is.
we
know
we're
almost
sure
he's
not
on
all
three
a
communist
or
fascist
and
a
member
of
the
silver
shirts.
it'd
be
most
remarkable
if
he
were.
but
do
we
have
to
compile
such
a
record
every
time
an
applicant
chooses,
without
(inaudible)
saving
any
reason
for
it
that
it
will
embarrass
him,
that
it
would
be
misunderstood,
that
it
will
incriminate
him
even
if
it
isn't
a
privilege,
there
might
be
some
good
reason
where
a
person
wouldn't
care
to
answer.
i
can't
think
of
one
but
there
might
be.
but
when
he
gives
no
reason
why
do
we
have
to
have
a
hearing
and
--
and
to
compile
transcript
of
these
dimensions.
i
do
think
that
an
applicant
can
walk
into
the
clerk's
office
here
and
say,
"i
want
to
be
admitted
to
the
bar."
well,
have
you
ever
been
disbarred
in
your
own
state?"
"well,
i
won't
tell
you
but
i've
got
affidavits
of
a
lot
of
people
who
think
that
i
haven't
been
and
have
no
--
they
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
i
have
and
would
probably
know
if
i
were."
we
say
that
once
you
granted
it
that
the
--
that
the
matter
of
communist
affiliation
is
material,
then
it
follows
automatically
that
a
question
as
to
whether
he's
a
member
of
the
communist
party
is
material.
petitioner
suggests
that
we
owed
to
substitute
the
presumption
of
innocence
for
the
presumption
of
guilt
in
these
hearings.
well,
that's
just
exactly
what
we
do
not
do.
we
require
an
affirmative
showing
of
good
character.
that
showing
is
the
extremely
light
when
there
isn't
anything
to
contradict,
just
as
we
require
a
man
to
take
an
oath
that
he's
over
21
before
we'll
admit
him
to
the
bar.
if
he
isn't
over
21
and
he's
granted
to
get
admitted
to
the
bar
anyway,
he
is
trying
to
do
something
that
is
at
least
illegal,
if
not,
unlawful.
we
make
him
take
an
oath.
we
don't
take
his
birth
certificate.
we
could
get
a
question
as
to
whether
he
was
21
within
the
evidence
but
i
never
heard
of
one.
and
we
ask,
we
do
ask
on
our
questionnaire,
"have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
crime?"
it's
easier
to
ask
him
than
it
is
to
ransack
the
records
of
every
penitentiary
in
the
united
states
for
every
applicant
who
comes
before
us.
if
we
can't
ask
this
questionnaire,
"are
you
a
communist?"
then,
there
are
almost
no
questions
that
we
can
ask.
if,
as
petitioner
suggests,
we
have
to
have
some
--
some
kind
of
probable
cause,
such
as
you
need
to
get
a
search
warrant
or
to
examine
books
or
make
an
arrest.
we
didn't
have
it
in
this
case.
we
did
get
some,
i
think,
ambiguous
writings
about
revolution.
they
are
not
per
se
seditious
even
if
they
were
verbatim
quotations
from
the
declaration
of
independence.
they
could
be
in
a
context
that
would
prompt
a
question,
not
a
disqualification
and
the
question
was
asked
regarding
a
--
a
response
but
not
billing
an
answer
and
then
the
question
was
asked
about
communist
affiliations
and
then
we
have
any
action,
a
refusal
to
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
ought
to
know
that,
your
honor.
i
can
find
out
by
a
telephone
call
during
--
during
the
recess
but
it's
over
a
thousand.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
even
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
remember.
i
don't
even
--
they
first
appear
on
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
wines
there
was
an
essay
on
--
on
the
right
of
revolution
on
which
we
make
no
point
of
the
essay
itself
was
--
as
--
as
being
disqualifying
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
which
some
--
which
some
member
of
the
committee
had
read.
why
he
read
it,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that,
i
don't
remember.
i'll
be
glad
that
you'll
turn
to
mr.
anastaplo
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
just
don't
remember
where
--
what
publication
it
appeared
in
and
we
make
no
point
that
the
writing
itself
would
disqualify
anybody
from
anything
except
maybe
a
course
in
literature
where
clarity
of
expression
was
a
prerequisite
to
admission,
but
not
to
any
--
any
other
type
of
organization.
and
it
prompted
some
questions,
some
natural
questions
and
petitioner
then
said
that
it's
use
were
of
those
who
wrote
the
declaration
of
independence,
those
of
abraham
lincoln,
then
they
--
but
it's
the
fact
that
he
took
it
from
the
text
of
the
declaration
of
independence.
certainly,
it
doesn't
make
it
seditious
but
neither
does
it
sanctify
it,
because
there
isn't
any
passage
even
from
the
decalogue
where
the
sermon
on
the
mount
that
couldn't
in
some
context
and
i
don't
say
in
this
case,
be
--
be
the
start
of
a
war.
wars
have
been
fought
over
just
exactly
those
things,
what's
meant
by
the
10
commandments
and
what's
meant
by
the
sermon
on
the
mount
and
people
have
died
for
it
and
he
wrote
these
views
on
revolution
and
he
was
asked
some
questions
then,
no
information
of
any
kind
and
what
this
amounts
to
result
that
petitioner
has
to
answer
the
question.
i
want
to
dispose
of
one
other
contention.
there
is
a
suggestion
that
petitioner
has
denied
due
process
of
law
because
it
doesn't
appear
that
we
asked
every
applicant
these
questions.
well,
it
doesn't
appear
that
any
applicant
in
illinois
has
ever
been
denied
admission
to
the
bar
for
failure
to
answer
any
kind
of
question.
and
if
petitioner
means
to
suggest
that
we
have
to
ask
every
applicant
these
questions
or
can
ask
no
applicant
such
a
question
and
as
we
say
in
our
brief,
he
--
we
think
he
misprices
the
import
of
the
due
process
clause
because
of
very
purpose
of
these
hearings
having
the
moral
instead
of
having
stereotype,
mimeograph
questionnaires
which
would
save
everybody
time
is
to
have
the
kind
of
give
and
take
between
applicant
and
members
of
the
committee
that
makes
it
so
delightful
to
practice
in
this
court
not
knowing
where
the
questions
will
lead
us
or
the
court.
and
if
we
have
to
have
a
stereotype
form
of
a
--
a
quiz,
we
can
do
it.
but
we
don't
think
that
we
have
to
ask
every
applicant
the
same
question
and
your
honors
held
as
recently
as
monday
that
--
in
the
case
from
arkansas
that
there
might
will
be
circumstances
in
which
a
particular
teacher
indicated.
your
honors
didn't
hold
that
intimated,
that
there
might
well
be
circumstances
under
which
a
particular
teacher
might
have
to
list
every
organization
in
which
he
or
she
was
a
member.
and
we
are
in
vain.
we
--
we
usually
think
in
an
equal
protection
clause
that
equal
protection
results
when
--
when
equally
or
similarly
circumstanced
persons
or
classes
are
treated
dissimilarly,
but
you
can
just
as
readily
have
denial
of
equal
protection
when
unequally
or
differently
circumstanced
people
are
treated
equally.
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
very
important
consideration
that
should
guide
the
court
in
the
consummation,
in
its
deliberations
found
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
had,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
except
for
thanking,
your
honors.
