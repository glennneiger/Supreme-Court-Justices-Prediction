mr.
morris,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
how
much
emergency
were
to
veterans'
hospitals
do?
how
often
would
it
be
that
a
person
would
be
brought
in
from
an
accident
or
in
to
--
in
to
a
veterans'
hospital?
i
--
i've
been
under
the
impression,
perhaps,
quite
mistakenly
that
veterans'
hospitals
had
chronic
patients
more
often
and
that
people
picked
up
off
the
street,
automobile
accidents
and
so
on
were
taken
to
veterans'
hospitals
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
care
about
statistics.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
they
are.
justice
potter
stewart
do
they
handle
any
--
anybody
unless
--
until
or
unless
they
know
he's
a
veteran?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i
wondered
about.
i
wonder
if
--
if
for
that
reason
whether
or
not
they
do
take
emergency
people.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
except
he
had
been
in
other
hospitals
long
enough
for
--
for
everything
to
be
found
out
about
him
that
was
going
to
be
found
out.
they
knew
he
was
a
veteran
at
the
time
he
was
in
the
veterans'
hospital.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
important.
i
just
wondered
if
you
did
know.
i
don't
really
know.
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
had
impression
in
other
words.
