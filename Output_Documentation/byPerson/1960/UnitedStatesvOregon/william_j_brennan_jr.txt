but
ms.
zorn,
i
wonder,
looking
at
the
statement
of
mr.
rankin,
it
actually
--
what
he
suggested
is
if
the
veteran
is
competent
to
dispose
of
his
property
whether
by
will,
gift
or
otherwise,
then
he
may
do
so.
the
exception
is
what
he
is
incompetent
to
make
an
agreement,
then
uncle
sam
takes
it
because
he's
incompetent
to
dispose
of
over
itself.
but
what
mr.
rankin
said
was,
â€œit
cannot
possibly
be
any
conflict
because
the
veteran
agrees
to
this
arrangement
when
he
enters
the
hospital,
the
only
exception
would
be
where
the
veteran
is
insane".
his
agreement
would
not
amount
to
anything
in
that
instance
and
therefore,
we
don't
condition
uncle
sam's
taking
it
upon
his
making
an
agreement
when
he's
insane
because
he
can't
make
one.i
think
that's
what
the
statute
may
be.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
they
were
talking
--
they
make
it
clear
what
they
were
talking
about,
was
a
--
there
was
a
nuisance
to
have
--
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
know
what
to
do
of
the
kind
of
thing
that
usually
the
deceased
veteran
left
behind,
and
namely
old
suit
cases,
old
trunks
and
suit
cases
and
things
like
that,
and
they
didn't
want
to
have
to
go
calling
upon
the
states
to
help
them
dispose
of
old
trunks
and
suit
cases.
they
didn't
expect
to
have
money
$17,000
windfall.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
the
(voice
overlap)
the
government
has
suggested.
the
idea
was
to
let
the
veteran
dispose
of
his
property
or
it's
nothing
about
his
coming
into
the
hospital
which
was
to
--
that
he
had
to
pay
for
the
attention
he
received
or
anything
else
he
might
dispose
of
it
but
if
he
suggest
--
may
be
what
mr.
rankin
meant
was,
if
he
was
competent
to
dispose
of
it
and
let
him
dispose
of
it
but
it
--
it
was
not
uncle
sam
would
take
it
because
most
of
the
time,
it
was
an
old
trunk
or
an
old
suit
case
and
it
was
easy
to
dispose
of
it
that
way,
then
he
have
to
go
to
the
red
paper,
going
back
to
the
states
and
that's
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
important
thing,
not
mentally
but
physically.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
he'd
be
competent
to
agree
--
mentally
to
agree
and
this
agreement
would
be
required.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he's
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
not
apply.
