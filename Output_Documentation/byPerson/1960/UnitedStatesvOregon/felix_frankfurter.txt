would
it
weaken
your
argument
if
one
concluded
that
congress
didn't
think
about
it
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
you
must
interpret
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
real
question
is
what
color
is
the
congress
to
say
that
a
veteran
being
treated
to
a
--
being
treated
by
a
veterans'
hospital,
who
believes
no
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
the
property
shows
advert
of
united
states
rather
than
in
the
state
from
which
he
died.
that's
the
real
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
real
question
because
if
--
if
it
hasn't
any
power
to
do
that
by
ordinary
language,
it
can't
show
it
self
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
my
brother
by
saying
a
conclusive
presumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
there
be
a
conclusive
presumption
to
the
veteran
who's
demanded
this
--
once
instructed
to
go
to
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happens
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon,
go
on
please.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
the
practical
--
the
practical
situation
created
by
an
intestacy
of
this
sort,
is
by
a
failure
to
devolve
the
property
or
to
have
anybody
inheriting
it
through
intestacy
is
that
here
is
a
property
left
by
a
veteran
who
would
had
been
in
a
veterans'
hospital
and
enjoyed
the
bounty
of
the
government
to
that
extent,
his
property
and
some
disposition
must
be
made
of
it
but
if
the
congress
of
united
states
doesn't
step
in
the
estate,
as
the
escheat
of
the
state
that
if
nobody
else
to
take
it,
so
the
(inaudible)
to
which
we
all
belong
--
which
we
all
belong,
as
it
was
been
inherited,
but
what
abstraction,
what
--
what
conflict
is
there
would
--
would
--
to
the
reserved
power
of
the
states
to
profit
by
this
escheat
when
uncle
sam
has
no
relation
to
the
escheatable
property?
what
abstraction
is
that?
you
say
that
when
uncle
sam
does
have
a
relation
to
"ie",
he
has
been
a
good
samaritan
to
the
deceased
owner,
that
uncle
sam
steps
into
congress
of
united
states
and
said,
steps
in
by
virtue
of
that
fact,
"we
assert
the
superior
power
to
the
state
which
has
no,
no
relation
in
justice
or
no
basis
in
justice
except
there's
nobody
else
to
take
it
and
somebody
must
take
it."
uncle
sam
says,
“we
got
a
superior
right
to
that
abstract
relation
of
the
estate
to
escheat,
namely,
we've
been
good
to
the
man
whose
property
is
non-incompetent.
what
--
what
provision
of
the
constitution?
the
tenth
amendment
says,
“all
reserved
--
all
powers
not
here
is
disposed
of,
but
we
have
to
look
around
and
look
if
there
is
any
power
not
disposed
of,
and
isn't
there
a
power,
your
assert
power
because
of
the
relationship
to
the
dead
man
who
left
the
property."
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
out
of
a
common
law
contract,
uncle
sam
does
say
by
virtue
of
our
samaritanship,
we
lay
claim
on
this.
what
so
hard
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
profits
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
congress,
as
constitutional
as
you
say
anything
about
it,
but
it
does
say
that
you
may
establish
veterans'
hospital,
it
does
say
that
uncle
sam
has
also
to
--
relationship
to
the
veteran,
it
does
constitutionally
authorized
uncle
sam
to
give
his
bounty
to
the
veteran
and
is
implied
consequent
to
that
it
says,
"we
go
to
search
some
right
to
regard
to
it."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
your
position
doesn't
require
to
--
a
challenge
to
that
constitutional
argument.you
said
the
statute
as
a
matter
of
construction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
requires
a
contract
relation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you're
right
about
that
that
even
if
one
could
formulate
a
constitutional
doctrine
to
show
the
answer
that
congress
hasn't
asserted?
