mr.
herbert
e.
morris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involved
the
competing
claims
of
the
united
states,
this
trustee
of
the
post
fund
of
va
hospitals
and
homes
in
the
state
of
oregon
to
the
personalty
of
adam
warpouske,
a
veteran
who
died
without
heirs
or
will
in
a
veterans'
hospital
in
portland,
oregon.
the
post
fund
covers
expenditures
for
recreational
and
religious
purposes
for
veterans
in
hospitals
and
homes.
the
government's
claim
is
based
on
the
provisions
of
38
u.s.c.
17
--
17
(j),
important
provisions
of
which
i'll
discuss
in
a
moment
in
my
argument.
the
statute
provides
in
essence
that
whenever
any
veteran
dies
as
a
patient
receiving
free
care
and
treatment
leaving
neither
heirs
nor
will,
the
money
goes
to
the
post
fund
for
the
sole
benefit
and
use
of
these
veterans
left
in
this
institution.
the
state's
claim
is
based
on
this
escheat
statute.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
and
are
these.
warpouske,
a
word
war
i
veteran,
suffered
from
a
non-service
connected
mental
disability
which
he
incurred
during
the
1920s
and
from
which
he
suffered
thereafter.
between
1930
and
1945,
he
entered
veteran
hospitals
and
homes
on
14
separate
occasions,
spending
a
total
of
seven
years
in
these
institutions
receiving
free
care
and
treatment
for
both
mental
and
physical
impairment.
he
signed
applications
on
these
entries
saying
he
was
unable
to
bear
the
cause,
he
was
a
non-service
connected
case,
and
agreeing
to
leave
the
property
within
the
terms
of
this
statute.
now,
the
events
leading
up
to
his
final
stay
in
a
veterans'
hospital
and
the
dispute
here
commenced
in
december
of
1955.
on
that
day,
on
december
31st,
1955,
mr.
warpouske
was
admitted
to
the
good
samaritan
hospital
in
portland
for
treatment
of
a
hip
fracture
and
a
cerebral
hemorrhage.
this
was
a
private
hospital.
on
january
5th,
1956,
shortly
thereafter,
because
it
appeared
that
he
was
without
fund,
the
state
transferred
him
to
the
multnomah
county
hospital
for
treatment
at
the
county's
expense.
during
his
period
both
in
the
oregon
hospital
and
subsequently
in
the
veterans'
hospital,
mr.
warpouske
was
mentally
incompetent
and
also
in
the
state
of
coma
or
semi-coma
continuing.
on
march
1st,
1956,
he
was
transferred
by
state
officials
to
the
veterans'
hospital
in
portland.
on
march
9th,
it
was
discovered
that
he
just
become
heir
--
sole
heir
to
the
estate
of
a
brother
who
predeceased
him
in
a
veterans'
hospital
in
wisconsin.
on
march
19th,
1956,
he
died
without
heirs
or
will.
he
left
the
net
estate
of
some
$13,000.
the
estate
was
paid,
as
they
always
are
under
the
statute,
the
federal
government
did
not
contest
their
right
to
reimbursement
for
their
public
hospital
care
and
treatment,
so
that
for
the
multnomah
county
care
and
treatment
he
--
the
estate
was
paid.
the
estate
conceded
to
the
united
states
about
a
thousand
dollars,
an
unused
pension
fund
and
that
is
in
--
in
dispute
here.
what
is
in
dispute
is
the
remaining
$12,000.
now,
the
trial
court
rule
at
this
statute,
on
which
the
government
relies
for
support
here,
is
based
on
the
prerequisite
of
an
actual
common
law
contract
but
since
warpouske
was
mentally
incompetent,
could
not
and
did
not
enter
into
such
a
contract,
the
property
at
personalty
did
not
pass
united
states
but
went
to
the
estate
under
this
escheat
statute.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
on
--
on
appeal
by
united
states
affirmed
taking
the
same
basic
view
of
the
statute.
it's
view
with
influence
largely
by
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
stevens,
which
we
shall
discuss,
and
by
certain
constitutional
consideration,
which
we
shall
also
discuss.
the
government's
argument
is
divided
in
a
two
essential
part.
the
first
is
that
this
statute,
the
provisions
of
which
can
be
found
on
pages
3
to
7
of
the
government's
brief,
constitute
a
self-executing
or
automatic
statute.
the
only
important
considerations
are
that
a
veteran
die
at
the
patient
in
a
veterans'
hospital
or
home
leaving
neither
heirs
nor
will
and
then
the
money
vest
for
use
of
other
veterans
in
terms
of
post
fund
expenditure.
our
second
argument,
of
course,
is
that,
as
so
construed,
the
statute
does
not
violate
the
tenth
or
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
let
me
clear
up
any
confusion
immediately
about
what
the
statute
does
or
does
not
do.
it
leaves
the
veteran
complete
right
to
leave
by
will
to
anyone
whom
he
selects
up
to
the
date
of
his
death
and
the
--
the
federal
government
honors
in
intestate
succession
under
the
law
of
the
state
or
anyone
to
whom
he
might
leave
by
will,
right
to
the
date
of
his
death.
now,
aside
from
the
constitutional
conspirations
which
we
think
improperly
influenced
the
supreme
court
of
oregon's
decision.
we
submit
that
the
statute,
when
analyzed
as
a
whole,
does
not
require
a
common
law
contract
between
a
man
coming
into
a
hospital
and
that
va,
the
property
to
pass.
i
turn
initially
to
the
cornerstone
provision
on
the
bottom
paragraph
at
page
3.
this
is
the
so-called
vesting
provision,
a
provision
which
the
court
below
completely
overlooked
in
its
result.
that's
--
that
provision
state
that
whenever
any
veteran,
and
i
underscore
any,
dies
in
a
prescribed
circumstances,
that
is,
leaving
neither
heirs
nor
will
while
receiving
free
care
and
treatment
in
a
hospital
or
home,
his
personal
property
“shall
immediately
vest
in
and
become
the
property
of
united
states,”
his
trustee
for
the
post
fund.
now,
we
submit
that
the
use
of
the
terms
"any
veteran"
show
the
congress
was
not
distinguishing
between
treatment
under
this
statute
of
competent
men,
incompetent
men,
men
in
a
coma,
men
who
are
able
to
let
this
man
for
five
minutes
before
an
operation,
they
were
applying
it
to
any
veteran
who
was
in
a
va
hospital
or
home.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
i
think
that
it
wouldn't
weaken
it.
we
must
interpret
intention
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
from
the
tools
we
have
at
hand
and
the
statute,
i
submit,
is
the
best
and
primary
source.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
we
must
interpret
the
statute.
there
is
some
legislative
history,
which
i
shall
discuss.
but
the
terms
of
the
statute,
we
think,
are
clear
enough.
this
vesting
provision,
if
there
were
no
more,
certainly,
one
cannot
reach
the
conclusion
of
common
law
contract
here.
and
we
submit
in
the
remaining
provisions
that
unless
one
can
find
the
requirement
of
an
actual
common
law
contract
because
such
a
requirement
would
really
undercut
the
--
the
initial
vesting
provision,
unless
one
can
find
requirement
of
a
consensual
argument
between
veteran
and
va,
then
the
vesting
provision
remains
enforced.
and
we
submit
there
is
nothing
in
the
remaining
provisions
to
undercut
the
force
and
effect
of
the
vesting
provision.
on
page
4,
turning
to
the
first
full
paragraph
of
section
17,
it
says,
“the
foregoing
provisions,”
meaning
the
vesting
provision,
“are
conditions
precedent
to
the
furnishing
of
care
and
treatment.”
not
a
common
law
contract
but
the
vesting
provision.
the
next
sentence
we
come
to,
the
court
below
referred
to
certain
terms
like
acceptance
and
assignment
but
we
must
note
the
context
are
used
in
here.
the
acceptance
of
care
or
treatment
by
any
veteran
shall
constitute
an
acceptance
of
the
provisions
of
the
chapter
and
have
the
effect
of
an
assignment.
it
doesn't
say
that
an
actual
assignment
or
an
actual
knowing,
common
law
contract
is
required.
and
we
submit
the
best
parallel
to
this
kind
of
statute,
this
isn't
a
unique
type
of
--
of
provision,
are
found
in
a
non-resident
motor
vehicle
laws
whereby
service
process
on
a
secretary
of
state
in
terms
of
a
non-resident
being
involved
in
an
accident
is
accomplished.
those
laws
commonly
provide,
and
i
paraphrase,
acceptance
of
the
rights
and
privileges
of
using
our
highways
shall
constitute
an
acceptance
or
be
equivalent
to
an
agreement
of
services
process
on
the
secretary
of
state.
no
one
would
contend
that
if
an
incompetent
were
driving
through
the
state
and
was
involved
in
an
accident
that
that
statute
would
not
apply
nor
would
one
contend
that
if
a
man
drove
through
a
state
without
a
sign
saying,
“i
do
not
agree,”
that
the
statute
could
only
be
applicable
if
there
were
a
common
law
agreement.
and
we
don't
think
that
this
statute
does
anything
more
than
that
because
legislatures
have
a
certain
fear
of
laying
down
rules
in
ad
vitam,
and
they
use
certain
language
that
says,
“certain
events
to
us
are
equal
to
the
existence
of
a
common
law
contract.”
and
they
often
do
this.
it
doesn't
mean
that
they
are
saying,
for
this
statute
to
operate,
you
got
to
have
an
actual
common
law
contract.
the
conclusive
presumption
provision
of
17
(a),
as
far
as
reflecting
the
intention
of
congress,
we
submit
is
--
is
clear
as
far
as
vesting
goes.
if
congress
was
thinking
about
a
--
an
actual
common
law
contract,
it
would've
provided,
perhaps,
for
a
rebuttable
presumption,
so
that
evidence
of
incompetency
and
evidence
of
duress
or
whatever
other
contractual
considerations
could
be
used
would
be
applicable.
but
here,
they
say
the
fact
of
death,
the
fact
of
death
of
the
veteran
in
a
hospital
while
being
furnished
care
or
treatment
shall
give
rise
to
a
conclusive
presumption
of
a
valid
contract.
again,
maybe
inartistic,
unnecessary
usage
of
this
comforting
notion
of
a
--
of
a
contractual
result
but
certainly
as
widmore
says,
“this
is
--
this
conclusive
presumption
is
a
contradiction
in
term”.
and
says
no
more
than
as
a
rule
of
law
when
you
have
the
fact
of
death
in
this
case
and
the
result
is
established
without
any
possibility
of
evidence,
then
all
the
legislatures
are
interested
in
the
fact
of
death,
and
the
case
was
established.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
that
--
that's
true,
but
we
--
and
we
are
saying
that
although
certain
comforting
language
was
put
in
about
contract
unless
you
find
the
requirement
of
an
actual
common
law
contract.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
perhaps
so,
but
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
showing
up,
but
i
--
unless
you
find
actual
common
law
contract,
they
were
intended
vesting
and
that's
what
they
accomplished.
the
conclusive
presumption
provision,
i
think,
really
butchers
the
vesting
provision.
if
they
were
thinking
of
--
of
a
case
where
concepts
of
contract
could
be
introduced,
you
wouldn't
provide
for
a
conclusive
presumption.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
what
the
basis
for
is.
if
this,
in
fact,
were
a
case
where
we
weren't
looking
at
intention
and
where
there
was
an
actual
common
law
contract
required,
you
could
find
that,
then
using
a
conclusive
presumption
might
be
questionable.
this
court
has
struck
down
certain
conclusive
presumptions
where
there
has
to
be
a
rational
relationship
between
the
thing
assumed
and
the
thing
could
be
proven.
but
here,
we're
pointing
to
conclusive
presumption
provision
as
a
reflection
of
congressional
intention
and
that
is,
that
all
that's
important
to
them
is
that
there
be
death
and
then
the
property
pass
even
though
they
say
it's
opposed
the
contract.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
yes.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
and
that
is
why
constitutional
discussion,
and
i
--
and
i
shall
go
into
that
as
the
power
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
that
--
that's
correct,
if
it
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
that's
right.
if
the
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
if
there
were
no
conclusive
presumption
provision,
we'd
still
have
the
vesting
provision
and
be
faced
with
the
constitutional
problem
of
the
power
of
congress,
and
i
shall
go
in
to
--
and
i
shall
treat
that.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
the
conclusive
presumption
provision?
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
no,
i
think
that
congress
as
--
as
a
--
under
the
power
to
provide
hospitalization
and
other
gratuities
under
the
power
to
maintain
an
army
and
navy
can't
put
reasonable
conditions
on
these
gratuities.
they
could
take
the
gratuities
like
hospitalization
away
completely.
and
this,
as
i
shall
show,
is
a
very
reasonable
condition
without
contract
as
--
as
an
automatic
operating
feature
without
--
without
implying
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
that's
right.
and
we
--
and
we
submit
that
there
is
a
constitutional
power,
and
i
shall
come
to
that
in
my
constitutional
discussion.
but
i
do
want
to
finish
my
discussion
of
the
--
of
the
term
for
the
statute
and
the
legislative
history.
the
notice
provisions
in
17
(g)
on
page
6,
aren't
constitute
no
more
than
that
this
law
like
so
many
others
will
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
veteran
in
the
hospital
and
maybe
accomplished
not
only
by
placing
it
on
the
application
form,
but
by
posting
it
in
a
prominent
place.
no
concept
of
actual
contract
here,
just
a
reminder
to
the
veterans
that
if
they
don't
have
close
relatives,
they
may
leave
by
will.
now,
the
legislative
history,
we
submit,
is
best
reflected
by
this
statute
and
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
an
actual
common
law
contract
here.
there
are
certain
strains
of
other
legislative
history
favoring
the
government
and
certain
legislative
history
favoring
respondent
here.
but
i
think
as
judge
frank
often
observed
where
there
is
some
legislative
history
on
both
sides,
one
does
not
precluded
from
looking
at
the
terms
of
the
statute,
and
that's
what
i
--
i've
just
done,
and
i
think
it's
the
best
and
primary
source
of
legislative
history
here.
the
legislative
history
supporting
the
government
is
the
change
in
language,
first
of
all,
between
the
predecessor
statute
and
this
one.
on
page
25
of
the
government's
brief,
the
1910
act
is
set
out
in
a
footnote.
that
act
used
the
terms
"not
only
application
of
the
veteran
shall
be
obtained
but
his
consent
shall
be
obtained".
there
is
no
such
language
in
--
in
the
revised
statute.
in
the
first
sentence,
the
application
and
admission
of
the
applicant
shall
be
in
constitute
of
valid
contract.
there
is
no
such
language
here.
application
here
is
just
for
notice.
application
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
getting
into
a
va
hospital.
it's
a
way
of
determining
a
man's
eligibility.
the
other
legislative
history
on
which
the
government
relied
is
the
factual
context
in
which
this
act
was
passed
in
1941.
at
that
time,
55%
to
60%
of
the
patients
in
va
hospitals
and
homes
were
neuropsychiatric
patients.
most
of
them
--
many
of
them,
presumably,
entered
incompetent,
many
of
whom
didn't
have
a
guardian.
90%
of
the
men
entering
institutions
at
this
time
were
non-service
connected
cases
and
not
indigent
and
were
going
to
leave
much
of
a
stay.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
the
general
post
fund
is
set
up
under
31
u.s.c.
725s,
i
believe,
and
it's
a
fund
created
at
non-appropriated
funds
for
purposes
of
providing
religious
and
recreational
services
for
veterans
in
va
hospitals
and
homes.
it
takes
gifts
as
well
as
under
this
statute.
it
is
true
that
congressman
rankin
or
the
chairman
of
the
veteran
affairs
committee,
in
a
debate
on
the
house
floor,
took
the
opposite
interpretation
of
this
bill
but
the
government
takes
here.
let
me
put
his
statement
in
context
because
i
think
it's
important.
the
bill
was
drafted
in
the
veteran's
administration.
mr.
rankin's
statement
that
it
only
applied
when
a
man
physically
or
mentally
able
to
contract
was
made
without
the
benefit
of
any
hearing,
there
were
no
hearing.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
it's
referred
to
in
my
brief,
and
it
set
out
in
appellee's
brief,
your
honor.
part
of
the
colloquy,
at
least,
is
set
out
on
the
floor
starting
on
page
16
of
the
state's
brief.
that's
just
part
of
it
there.
we
refer
to
it
in
its
place
in
the
congressional
record.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
he
was.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
he
was.
there's
nothing
in
the
committee
reports
--
there
was
no
conference
report.
nothing
in
the
committee
reports
to
back
up
his
statement.
the
context
in
the
colloquy
whether
this
bill
was
brought
up
in
a
hurry,
another
member
of
the
committee,
mr.
pfeffer
asked
mr.
rankin,
"wouldn't
there
be
a
conflict
here
between
escheat
laws
and
this
federal
statute?"
mr.
rankin
stated,
and
we
--
we
think
implicitly
in
his
opinion
that
there
would
be
no
conflict
because
a
veteran
had
to
enter
into
a
contract.
and
if
he
was
insane
or
physically
unable,
the
statute
wouldn't
apply.
now,
there
was
no
--
the
colloquy
reflects
that
there
was
not
even
unanimity
of
opinion
on
the
committee."
it
just
been
brought
up
that
moment
on
the
floor,"
mr.
rankin
answered.
certainly,
it
doesn't
have
the
stature
of
the
most
persuasive
type
of
legislative
history
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
and
commissioner
reacts,
that
is,
the
committee
report.
it's
a
sincere
belief
of
mr.
rankin,
i
believe,
a
mistaken
one.
we
think
that
the
statute
here,
the
legislative
history
that
is
favoring
the
government
that
changes
in
language
from
the
1910
act
and
the
actual
situation
in
1941
overweigh
what
mr.
rankin
said
in
the
balances
the
court
must
draw.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
the
committee
report
did
not
expressly
but
it
had
a
paraphrasing
of
the
language
used
which,
in
your
comparison,
you
will
see
the
considerable
change
from
the
1910
act
and
showed
in
its
paraphrase
that
each
of
these
provisions
was
self-executing.
they
didn't
mention
the
need
for
contract,
but
they
didn't
--
the
committee
report
didn't
direct
itself
explicitly
to
this
problem.
now,
the
state
cases,
three
state
cases
prior
to
this,
all
support
the
government.
and
i'll
leave
that
to
development
in
the
briefs.
the
administrative
practice
of
the
va
has
been
consistent
since
1941.
it
is
--
this
statute
has
been
applied
to
both
incompetent
and
competent.
the
stevens
case
is
the
only
decision
on
which
the
court
below
--
the
stevens
case
and
cases
subsequent
to
stevens
following
its
approach
are
the
cases
on
which
my
opponent
relied
and
which
the
court
below
relied.
but
that
--
in
that
case,
this
court
didn't
reach
the
issue.
this
was
a
1910
act
application
for
membership
to
an
old
soldier's
home,
a
competent
veteran.
the
government
argued
that
by
signing
a
form
saying,
"i
hereby
agree
to
leave
my
property,"
he
had
enacted
a
contract,
and
he
was
competent
too.
and
the
court
so
rule
but
it
didn't
have
to
reach
the
fact
situation
presented
here,
so
that
that
case
is
no
impediment
to
the
government's
position.
now,
we'd
like
to
compare
as
a
--
as
a
closing
on
the
statutory
half
of
my
argument,
the
stevens
decision
and
the
1941
act.
the
stevens
decision
just
involved,
under
the
1910
act,
application
of
membership
to
old
soldier's
homes
as
compared
to
people
who
were
being
admitted
to
hospitals,
application
to
an
old
soldier's
home
is
a
much
more
deliberate
process,
a
man
can
be
rejected
by
refusing
to
accept
these
provisions
on
a
whole
to
much
more
deliberate
process
in
hospital
admission.
and
i
think
that
contractual
concepts,
common
law
contract
to
pass
a
contract
made
sense
from
stevens.
but
the
1941
act
not
only
eliminated
it
all
in
1910
act's
use
of
the
terms
consent
and
formality
to
common
law
contract
but
it
is
applied
to
hospital.
men
like
warpouske,
men
who
aren't
mentally
incompetent
and
come
in
in
a
coma
come
in
everyday
under
emergency
situation,
the
application
here
isn't
a
prerequisite,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
to
regulation
that
makes
a
man
stay
in
a
va
hospital
if
he's
in
a
critical
condition
based
on
signing
an
application
form.
this
would
be
--
if
you
applied
common
law
contract
to
this
note
to
--
to
the
facts
of
the
hospital
cases,
this
would
be
an
impossible
statute
to
administer,
litigation
as
to
duress
where
an
operation
had
to
be
performed,
would
a
man
accept,
would
he
sign,
could
it
be
shipped
out
if
he
wouldn't
sign
and
when
he
needed
an
operation
in
a
veterans'
hospital,
we
say
that
common
law
contract
just
doesn't
make
sense,
it
reduces
the
hospital
situation
almost
to
an
absurdity.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
well,
i
think
--
i
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
i
have
no
statistical
before
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
from
--
from
my
statement.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
the
chronic
disable
more
or
less
goes
if
he
can
--
if
he
had
the
other
eligibility
requirements
to
a
domiciliary
which
is
what
the
1910
act
covered
in
old
soldier's
home
chronically
disabled.
but
i
think
the
veterans'
hospitals
do
handle
a
certain
number
of
emergency
cases.
i'm
not
sure
how
many
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
they'll
handle
anyone
if
he
--
even
if
he's
not
a
veteran.
they
may
--
if
he
--
finally
find
out
after
they
treat
him,
he's
not
a
veteran,
they
may
charge
him
with
a
--
with
a
cost
for
care
and
treatment.
but
they'll
--
they
will
--
i
mean,
the
fact
that
someone's
brought
to
them
in
an
emergency
situation
there
and
--
and
he
needs
help,
they're
not
going
to
say
at
this
--
right
now,
we
got
to
know
whether
this
man
is
a
veteran
or
out
he
goes
from
our
hospital.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
i
think
--
i
--
i
believe
they
do.
i
think
that
mr.
warpouske
was
in
fairly
critical
condition
here.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
well,
presumably
although
the
record
isn't
clear
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
that
his
eligibility
would
determine
without
an
application.
but
as
far
as
i
know,
people
may
be
transferred
in
critical
shape
as
they
were
here
from
state
hospitals
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
well
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
even
if
--
even
if
it
is
an
overwhelming
number,
i
would
say
the
problems
are
still
there
for
--
for
contract
concept
or
concepts
to
be
applied
here.
a
man
--
man
signed
a
form,
his
incompetency
or
competency
may
be
determines
by
veterans'
boards
at
subsequent
stages.
it's
very
difficult
to
--
to
determine
exactly
what
his
state
of
capacity
was
at
the
moment
he
signed
the
application
form.
in
other
words,
the
application
is
being
used
as
the
way
for
determining
eligibility.
what
happens
when
a
parent
or
--
or
a
friend
brings
him
in,
can
the
friend
contract
for
him?
the
friend
would
sign
the
form
normally.
this
is
just
the
way
to
make
sure
that
it
have
prima
facie
evidence
that
the
man
is
eligible
for
treatment.
turning
to
constitutionality
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
from
january
--
from
december
31st,
i
believe,
to
march
1
when
he
was
in
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
the
two
state
hospitals.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
19
days
in
the
veterans'
hospital
before
he
died.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
it
did
recover.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
yes.
now,
we
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
out
of
--
out
of
the
gross
estate,
it
was
paid
$198
for
care
and
treatment
in
the
--
in
multnomah
county
hospital.
so
that
it
--
it's
reimbursed,
all
claims
under
this
federal
statute,
your
honor,
even
if
it
would
take
up
all
the
money
of
his
estate,
the
--
the
state
would
come
first
before
the
federal
government.
so
that
not
only
heirs
nor
divide
either
will,
your
honor,
but
creditor's
claim.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
all
creditors
--
that's
correct.
the
tenth
amendment
i
don't
think
really
is
the
substantial
problem.
if
the
federal
government
enacts
a
statute
pursuant
to
a
power
delegated
to
it,
with
a
legitimate
purpose
in
mind,
and
if
it
uses
necessary
and
appropriate
means,
and
that
means
reasonable
mean,
would
brought
discretion
vested
in
congress,
then
there's
no
violation
of
the
tenth
amendment.
and
it
doesn't
matter
that
this
law
displaces
the
escheat
law
of
the
state
in
a
given
circumstance
because
the
supremacy
clause
says
that
the
federal
law
is
necessary
and
appropriate
and
pursuant
to
a
federal
power
delegated
on
the
constitution
as
supreme.
i
don't
think,
as
we
stated,
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
power.
they've
got
the
power
to
grant
all
sorts
of
gratuities
and
benefits
to
veterans
and
the
condition
of
those
grants
or
gratuities.
they
don't
have
to
provide
hospitalization
or
post
fund
benefits
at
all
to
these
veterans.
the
purpose,
i
think,
is
--
is
equally
indisputable
legitimacy
of
--
of
raising
money
in
some
fair
and
equitable
way
to
keep
the
post
fund
going
so
that
man
can
have
tv
sets
or
whatever
this
fund
covered.
so
the
only
question,
i
think,
is
whether
they've
chosen
--
whether
congress
has
chosen
necessary
and
appropriate
mean
with
all
the
discretion
in
the
--
in
that
--
in
that
standard
that
this
court
has
given
the
necessary
and
appropriate.
i
think
that
congress
has
implicitly
stating
for
constitutional
purposes
the
following
factors
in
using
this
vesting
apparatus,
in
using
the
--
the
automatic
or
self-executing
apparatus
that
we
say
the
statute
contained.
that
based
on
their
relationship
with
veterans,
they
can
offer
them
gratuities
and
condition
(inaudible),
that
they
are
assuming
a
state
burden
to
some
extent
by
va
hospital.
as
this
case
shows,
the
states,
when
they
have
a
man
who
is
eligible
for
va
treatment,
will
send
them
to
a
va
institution.
they
couldn't
do
what
states
do.
what
does
the
state
of
oregon
do
with
its
public
charges
who
die
in
their
--
in
a
--
in
a
state
hospital?
they
charged
the
estate
with
the
cost
of
care
and
treatment
before
the
taking
by
heirs
or
beneficiary,
so
that
warpouske
had
stayed
in
the
state
of
oregon
hospital,
his
estate
would
be
charged
with
a
full
cost
of
care
and
treatment
prior
to
taking
by
a
widow
or
anyone
else
he
might
have
left.
what
--
what
congress
is
doing
here
is
saying,
“we're
not
going
to
use
that
estate,
and
we
could
constitutionally
do
that.”
but
what
we're
going
to
do
is
seek
only
a
minimal
token
form
of
repayment.
most
of
the
men
who
come
into
our
institutions
are
indigent,
90%
of
them
in
1941.
warpouske
was
indigent
here.
we'll
exact
a
minimal
form
of
repayment
or
quid
pro
quo
when
a
man
doesn't
leave
by
will,
although
we
tell
him
he
can't
until
he
dies
in
this
institution
to
anyone
including
the
estate
if
he
doesn't
leave
anybody
by
intestate
succession,
then
we'll
take
what
he
has
in
personalty
because
we
think
we
have
a
paramount
right
in
view
of
what
we've
given
him
to
keep
the
post
fund
going.
in
fact,
it's
such
a
fair
device
that
we
can
presume
the
veteran
would
prefer
to
have
his
money
left
in
his
wife.
now,
there
are
may
be
a
more
direct
way
of
doing
it.
they
might
have
taxed
people
to
get
moneys
for
the
post
fund.
they
could've
charged
the
estate
as
--
as
states
do,
but
i
think
that
that
would
cut
out
the
estate
as
often
as
not,
it
would
cut
out
heirs
and
beneficiaries
often,
but
they
are
being
most
generous
to
veterans.
this
doesn't
--
this
is
the
best
possible
offer
of
veteran
going
into
these
institutions
because
his
estate
will
not
be
charged
in
any
way
unlike
state
hospital.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
the
power
is
the
power
to
--
to
exact
the
condition
on
--
on
the
extension
of
a
gratuity.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
there
is
no
restriction
in
the
law
as
i
understand
it
that
congress
exacts
$10
limitation
on
lawyer's
fees
for
men
who
represent
veterans
before
va
institution.
that
isn't
based
on
a
veteran
agreeing.
the
veteran
may
say,
“i'm
deprived
of
counsel
by
$10
fee.
i
can't
get
a
lawyer
for
that
amount
of
money.”
but
it's
not
based
on
contract.
congress
has
the
right
to
do
this
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
self-executing
law.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
of
oregon.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
that's
right,
and
that's
what
we
say
this
law
does.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
without
heirs.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
it
doesn't
a
ship
by
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
right.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
i'm
afraid
my
time
is
up.
can
i
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
--
answer
--
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
the
power,
your
--
your
honor,
is
no
different
than
the
power
exacted
by
--
by
congress
in
a
commerce
situation.
the
state
says,
“you've
taken
our
police
power
by
doing
what
you're
doing.”
what
you
call
at
the
police
power
or
anything
else
as
long
as
what
they've
done
is
a
mechanism.
that's
necessary
and
appropriate
to
a
--
to
a
power
granted
and
to
a
legitimate
purpose,
then
it's
valid
as
a
--
as
a
valid
federal
exercise.
they're
not
interfering
with
the
devolution
of
property
of
citizens
here
as
the
state
controls
over
the
devolution
of
property.
in
burnison,
this
court
said
that
the
united
states
has
a
power
to
receive.
the
state
can
control
to
whom
certain
citizens
can
give.
those
two
powers
are
separate.
in
burnison,
there
was
no
federal
law
by
which
the
federal
government
was
taking
person
with
two
some
powers.
here,
we
have
a
law
exercised
pursuant
to
the
power
to
condition
reasonable
gratuities
given
a
veteran.
we
don't
have
to
depend
on
a
notion
of
contract
to
exact
this
form
of
repayment
from
the
veteran.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
this
law
takes
nothing
from
the
veteran.
it
is
--
it's
the
most
beneficial
law
to
the
veteran,
he
couldn't
hope
for
a
better
law.
i
mean,
there
is
no
fifth
amendment
problem.
he's
not
deprived
with
any
property.
this
law,
unlike
state
laws,
as
i
pointed
out,
says
you
can
leave
to
heirs,
you
can
leave
to
will
and
we
won't
touch
it
only
if,
at
the
end
of
your
life,
there's
nothing
--
there
no
one
who
can
take
this
property
except
the
state,
the
united
states
thinks
it
has
a
right
to
take
for
its
extension
of
a
gratuities
to
you
in
a
past.
so
that
it,
really,
isn't
taking
anything
from
him
that
would
require
a
contract
from
him.
mr.
herbert
e.
morris
and
--
and
just
like
in
any
other
tenth
amendment
problem,
the
question
is
whether
it
has
the
power
to
take
it
from
the
state
or
to
depose
a
state
law.
this
--
there
is
nothing
sacrosanct
about
the
notion
of
this
escheat.
no
more
sacrosanct
in
the
notion
of
the
state's
right
over
its
police
power
or
the
state's
rights
over
a
local
political
activities,
as
in
oklahoma
versus
civil
service
commission
or
the
state's
rights
as
was
provided
in
the
constitution
in
case
versus
bowles
that
its
timberland
couldn't
be
sold
in
less
than
market
value.
but
the
emergency
price
control
act
was
held
to
be
of
a
valid
federal
exercise,
a
necessary
and
appropriate
carrying
out
of
the
war
powers,
and
it
didn't
matter
about
the
state
power.
and
i
say
this
is
a
parallel
situation.
thank
you.
