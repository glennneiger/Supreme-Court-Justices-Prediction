ms.
catherine
zorn
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
fundamentally
involves
the
construction
of
a
statute.
and
we
had
the
statute
before
us
and
the
purpose
here
is
to
construe
the
statute.
we
take
it,
we
find
it,
we
cannot
add
to,
we
cannot
take
from
it,
we
must
accept
the
statute
as
it
is
written.
essentially,
the
question
is
whether
this
statute
is
founded
upon
contract
and
the
state
contends
or
whether
still
operating
as
the
federal
government
contends.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
unique.
it's
unusual
situation.
this
man
was
mentally
incompetent
for
many
years.
he
suffered
a
stroke.
he
was
rendered
unconscious
in
period
preceding
his
hospital
--
his
final
hospitalization.
he
had
no
heirs.
he
fill
heirs
to
his
property,
he
never
knew
he
had
it.
he
was
unconscious
at
all
times.
he
was
no
more
than
semicomatose
or
at
best.
looking
at
the
statute,
we
find
that
it
is
couched
in
the
language
of
contract.
it
speaks
of
the
acceptance
of
the
terms
or
the
conditions
of
the
statute
as
giving
rise
to
an
assignment.
he
speaks
of
a
presumption
of
contract
arising
out
of
the
fact
of
death
in
the
hospital,
albeit,
this
is
a
conclusive
presumption
that
the
statute
says.
however,
the
statute
--
the
conclusive
presumption
provided
in
the
statute
must
be
examined
in
relation
to
the
statute,
in
relation
to
facts.
it
must
necessarily
presuppose
the
person
mentally
incompetent
to
contract
just
as
in
the
case
of
a
written
instrument,
ordinarily
the
recitals
in
a
written
instrument
are
presumed
to
be
conclusive.
however,
that
does
not
preclude
going
into
the
facts
and
seeing
whether
or
not
this
person
executing
the
statute
had
no
capacity
to
do
so.
a
person
without
mental
capacity
cannot
--
cannot
execute
a
valid
will
or
a
contract
or
a
deed.
it's
void
without
legal
effect.
so
hereto,
the
conclusive
presumption
in
this
statute
falls
for
the
lack
of
mental
competency
of
the
veteran.
going
on
to
the
--
we
need
not
rely
entirely
on
the
written
language
of
the
statute,
but
we
do
have
here
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
we
can
turn
to
the
congressional
record
and
find
what
congress
intended
and
that
is
the
thing,
that
is
the
primary
purpose
in
statutory
construction
to
see
what
congress
intended.
we
need
not
hear
the
line
fallback
on
the
language
of
statute
and
law
but
we
can
go
actually
the
congressional
record.
in
this
congressional
record,
the
very
question
presented
in
this
case
was
asked,
"does
it
apply
to
a
mentally
incompetent
veteran
for
a
person
who's
physically
unable
to
agree
to
anything?"
congressman
rankin
was
the
chairman
of
the
committee,
the
veterans'
affairs
committee
who
introduced
this
bill
in
the
congress.
he
was
asked
--
the
question
was
raised
to
the
point
was
raised
whether
this
put
conflict
with
state
law,
and
he
said
there
could
not
possibly
be
any
conflict
between
the
provisions
for
this
statute
and
state
escheat
laws.
in
his
word,
because
the
veteran
agrees
to
this
arrangement
when
he
enters
the
hospital
and
then
if
a
veteran
were
insane,
it
would
be
an
exception.
in
that
case,
as
the
veteran
were
insane,
in
his
words,
the
agreement
would
not
amount
to
anything.
when
asked
if
this
legislation
would
apply
to
a
physically
incompetent
veteran
who
might
be
picked
up
and
unable
to
agree
to
anything,
mr.
rankin
again
replied,
“if
he
does
not
agree,
then
this
does
not
apply.”
we
have
set
forth
--
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
16
part
of
the
pertinent
portions
of
the
congressional
record,
at
length,
in
order
to
give
the
comments
and
discussion
of
the
congressman
sponsoring
the
bill?
it's
setting
in
context.
as
mr.
rankin
pointed
out,
this
bill
involves
only
the
personal
property
of
veterans
who
died
in
his
estate
in
veterans
facilities
who
have
no
living
relatives.
on
page
17,
the
question
was
raised
as
to
the
state
escheat
laws
and
then
in
mr.
rankin's
language
he
said,
“let
me
say
to
the
gentleman
from
new
york,
there
cannot
possibly
be
any
conflict
because
the
veteran
agrees
to
this
arrangement
when
he
enters
the
hospital.
the
only
exception
would
be
where
the
veteran
is
insane,
his
agreement
would
not
to
amount
to
anything
in
that
case."
ms.
catherine
zorn
the
bill
itself
as
it
was
passed,
your
--
your
honor?
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
no
opposition
to
mr.
rankin's
comments.
there
was
no
discussion
--
no
--
nothing
in
the
discussion
to
show
that
anyone
disagreed
with
him.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
believe
his
purpose
in
saying
that
is
this,
that
the
statute
was
contractual
if
the
veteran
were
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
the
--
the
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
think
you
will
find
in
--
in
reading
the
entire
statute,
section
17
through
17
(j)
that
it
is
couched
in
languages
of
the
contract.
there
are
may
be
some
other
language,
perhaps,
but,
generally,
it
is
a
contractual
statute.
in
other
words,
the
statute
constitutes
an
offer
which
the
veteran
accepts
by
accepting
care
and
treatment
in
the
veterans'
hospital.
ms.
catherine
zorn
perhaps,
this
would
answer
the
question.
ms.
catherine
zorn
the
bill
went
through
without
any
amendment
or
any
opposition.
it
was
adopted
in
the
foreman
which
was
initiated
in
the
congress.
the
--
perhaps,
this
language
would
--
in
the
section
17
(a),
near
the
end
of
the
section,
it
appears
at
page
10
of
our
brief.
the
--
the
--
let
me
see.
it's
starting
a
little
further
up,
at
the
last
sentence
in
the
section
17.
it
goes
on
to
say
"the
acceptance
of
care
or
treatment
by
any
veteran
admitted
to
the
hospital,"
and
then
paraphrasing
a
little
bit,
"as
well
as
the
continued
acceptance
shall
constitute
an
acceptance
of
the
provisions
and
conditions
of
the
subchapter".
so
i
believe
there,
it
is
the
--
there
needs
to
be
a
contract
or
a
consensual
acceptance
of
care
and
treatment
to
constitute
or
it's
prerequisite
to
the
acceptance
of
the
conditions
of
the
subchapter
and
out
of
that,
the
vesting
arises.
ms.
catherine
zorn
17.
i
think
the
--
the
section
must
be
read
as
a
whole
and
as
a
whole
it
has
the
--
it
has
a
contractual
intent.
i
think
the
general
rule
is
that
the
remarks,
discussions
and
explanations
of
the
sponsoring
chairman
are
entitled
to
great
weight
in
the
construction
of
a
statute.
in
other
words,
this
legislative
intent
is
the
primary
thing,
and
this
is
what
the
people
who
enacted
the
statute
understood
that
it
would
not
apply
to
a
mentally
incompetent
veteran
was
unable
to
agree.
in
addition
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
the
legislative
history,
we
also
have
a
great
number
of
cases
in
which
the
statute
was
considered.
in
these
cases,
the
courts
recognized
that
this
statute
is
founded
on
contract,
the
predecessor's
statute
as
well
as
the
present
statute.
and
in
a
number
of
these
cases,
the
case
is
directly
reflect
the
federal
government
took
the
position
that
is
claimed
under
this
statute
is
founded
on
contract.
we
have
the
stevens
case
which
was
a
predecessor
statute,
albeit,
in
which
the
federal
government
took
the
position
that
his
claim
was
founded
on
contract.
but
we
have
the
case
of
which
the
state,
a
1953
kansas
case
which
considers
the
present
statute,
and
again
in
that
case,
the
federal
government
took
the
position
that
is
claimed
under
the
statute
was
based
on
contract.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
relied
--
the
government
itself
relied
on
the
case
--
on
the
stevens
case.
a
later
case
in
1955
decided
in
california,
again,
the
government
took
the
position
that
his
claim
was
based
on
contract.
we
have
numerous
other
cases.
they
numbered
about
a
dozen
in
which
the
courts
would
recognize
and
in
many
of
them,
the
federal
government
itself
statement
position
that
his
claim
was
contractual.
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
--
the
statute
must
be
construed
as
a
whole
and
that
the
ultimate
result
is
that
the
entire
statute
is
contractual
in
its
nature.
that,
at
least,
appears
to
be
the
legislative
intent
as
reflected
by
the
discussion
of
the
congressman.
that's
what
they
understood,
that
it
was
going
to
operate
contractually.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
think
that
it
gets
very
close
to
the
--
brings
us
to
the
tenth
amendment
question.
traditionally,
the
state
has
the
control
of
a
devolution
of
property.
this,
in
effect,
would
be
a
control
of
a
devolution
of
the
property
to
this
extent.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
particular
statute
does.
it
is
possible,
perhaps,
that
congress
may
enact
the
statute
but
we
do
not,
at
present,
have
that
kind
of
a
statute
here.
again,
that
is
the
question
we
would
have
to
see
the
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes,
i
believe
that
would
be
escheat
statutes
in
substance.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
believe
the
statute,
as
it
reads
as
a
whole,
is
intended
to
be
read
as
a
whole
and
it
was
not
intended
to
have
a
two-fold
operation.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
think
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
i'm
sorry.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
think
that
it
was
just
about
completely
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
if
--
if
the
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
if
that
is
a
delegated
power
to
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
--
the
federal
government
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
well,
perhaps,
this
can
be
said
that
if
the
veterans'
laws
are
extended
to
that
extent,
i
would
assume
that
there
would
be
the
--
the
supremacy
clause
would
prevail.
however,
i
think
like
an
everything
else,
there
is
a
line
of
demarcation
where
the
federal
power
in
--
from
a
state
power
begins
is
the
state
power
dominant
here
more
dominant
than
the
federal
power
and
that
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
--
it
didn't
--
reaches
the
fade
out
area.
ms.
catherine
zorn
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
catherine
zorn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
think,
primarily,
the
object
to
this
was
not
to
--
the
act
itself
didn't
--
or
there
was
not
in
contemplation
of
congress
any
source
of
revenue
you
might
say.
the
idea
was
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
that's
right.
ms.
catherine
zorn
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
is
a
very
narrow
case
because
most
veterans
who
are
incompetent
have
relatives.
most
of
them
who
do
not
have
relatives
have
a
guardian
to
act
for
them
on
their
admission
to
hospital
or
they
are
there
by
commitment
order.
and
the
very
few
who
are
left
with
no
relatives,
no
guardian,
no
commitment
order,
most
of
them
have
no
money,
and
it's
only
a
very
rare
case
that
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
quite
--
perhaps,
the
intent
of
the
legislate
or
the
congress
here,
however,
was
to
base
upon
contract
because
they
--
going
down
on
the
next
paragraph
here,
mr.
pfeffer
asked
there
might
be
cases
where
a
veteran
is
picked
up
in
an
incompetent
condition,
not
mentally
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
but
physically.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
think
it's
--
reading
a
little
further,
it
says,
he
was
unable
to
agree
to
anything
when
he
entered
the
hospital.
ms.
catherine
zorn
and
then
mr.
rankin
says,
“if
he
does
not
agree,
then
this
does
not
apply.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
think
the
primary
thing
is
the
statute
here
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
--
it
operates
contractually.
in
other
words,
it's
the
--
not
the
--
so
much
--
in
other
words,
the
statute
is
here,
we
must
take
the
statute,
we
find
it,
it
operates
contractually,
it
does
not
provide
for
escheat
that
operates
in
contract
and
therefore,
the
state
--
escheat
laws
prevailed
because
here,
the
veteran
was
unable
to
enter
into
an
agreement
and
no
contract
or
rules
and
therefore,
its
escheated.
ms.
catherine
zorn
under
escheat,
yes.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
don't
think
it's
too
much
of
question
of
the
power
as
the
actual
fact
of
the
statute.
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes.
ms.
catherine
zorn
on
the
alien
question
in
relation?
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes.
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes.
under
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
well,
perhaps,
it
is
possible
under
a
proper
statute
that
it
could
overwrite
but
under
this
present
statute
being
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
--
contractual,
it
does
not.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
don't
believe
i
have
very
much
to
add
in
conclusion
of
the
argument
here.
we've
gone
in
to
the
--
most
of
it,
in
the
matter
of
questioning
here.
i
might
mention
in
some
of
these
cases
that
were
mention
by
the
federal
government.
most
of
those
cases
involved
pension
funds
and
in
reading
the
case,
as
cited,
i
believe
they
were
--
the
veteran
was
under
guardianship,
so
it
may
be
that
in
that
particular
case,
the
veteran
came
under
both
statutes.
at
any
rate,
some
of
the
courts
do
not
distinguish
between
the
basic
difference
between
the
statute
here,
the
17
(j),
which
tends
--
which
rests
in
the
contract
and
the
section
450
relating
to
pension
funds
which
is
a
grant
by
the
federal
government
of
moneys
to
the
veteran
which
it
pertains
the
reversionary
interest.
we
have
no
part
of
funds
here
with
veteran's
funds,
but
we
conceded
that
they
referred
it
to
the
federal
government
because
it
was
a
condition
to
grant.
i
think
there
are
questions
relating
to
the
power
of
a
self-executing
statute
here
or
in
the
face
of
the
statute
being
contractual,
its
nature.
it's
more
or
less
hypothetical.
and
if
there
were
that
type
of
a
statute,
the
question,
a
self-offering
statute
here,
perhaps,
those
constitutional
questions
might
be
developed
a
little
bit
further.
but
here,
the
statute
is
based
in
contract,
its
evidence
by
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history
and
the
cases.
thank
you.
