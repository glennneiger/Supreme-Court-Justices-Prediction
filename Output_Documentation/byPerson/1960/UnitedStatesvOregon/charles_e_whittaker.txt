mr.
morris,
on
what
legal
basis
does
congress
have
power
to
impose
such
a
presumption?i
don't
know
that
they
have
it,
but
i
just
wonder
what
is
the
basis.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
morris
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
morris,
i
suppose
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
congress
says
power
to
set
up
the
veteran's
administration
and
such
these
hospitals
and
to
impose
conditions
one
of
which
would
be
the
one
we
have
here
but
that
get
you
into
the
trouble
of
implying
a
contract
and
the
need,
therefore,
for
contractual
capacity,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
reasonableness
wouldn't
save
it
though.
it
--
there
has
to
be
a
constitutional
power,
doesn't
it?

justice
charles

whittaker
but
most
united

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
now,
what
power,
specific
power
did
congress
have
to
overwrite
a
law
and
make
that
rule?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
without
federal
statute.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
all
in
section
17.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
ms.
zorn,
may
i
ask
you
please?
is
it
reasonable
to
construe
this
statute,
section
17
as
a
two-fold
one?
one,
the
first
paragraph
of
which,
as
mr.
justice
black
referred
to
just
a
moment
ago,
as
a
matter
of
simple
direction
provides
that
the
estate,
the
undisposed
of
estate
of
such
a
veteran
dying
in
the
hospital,
veterans'
hospital
shall
go
to
the
united
states?
now,
in
the
next
paragraph
says
that,
“acceptance
of
the
care
and
treatment
and
the
continued
acceptance
of
it
shall
have
the
effect
of
an
assignment
effective
at
that.”
now,
then,
that
will
appear
to
be
contractual.
is
it,
therefore,
reasonable
to
say
this
statute
is
two-fold?
they
got
to
be
at
both
ways.
and
if
one
fails,
you
still
have
to
weak
the
other?
do
i
make
that
clear?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
would
have,
i
think,
you
(inaudible)
you
would
have
that
statute
if
it
ended
with
the
(inaudible)
paragraph
of
section
17.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
--
is
that
possible
--
possible
to
leave
that
as
--
as
one
basic
views
of
the
government
(inaudible)
and
the
main
paragraph
is
another
basis
(inaudible)
in
the
contract?
