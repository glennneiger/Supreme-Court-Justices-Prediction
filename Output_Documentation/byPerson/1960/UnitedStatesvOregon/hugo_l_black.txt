justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
is
the
general
post
fund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
pointed
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
chairman
of
the
veteran's
committee
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
committee
report
referred
to
that
particular
point
as
mr.
rankin
had
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
then?
if
this
man
seems
to
have
been
in
hospital
in
portland
for
some
weeks
or
several
months
maybe?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
moved
to
the
veterans'
hospital
and
stayed
only
a
short
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
claim
or
is
anything
--
any
contest
here
to
whether
or
not
this
oregon
--
oregon
hospital
should
recover
anything
out
of
his
estate
for
services
it
rendered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
out
of
his
fund?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
merely
the
balance
you
have
the
payment
of
all
debt
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this.
to
what
language
of
the
act
at
that
time
or
the
bill
mr.
rankin
could
possibly
have
been
referred
when
he
said
it
required
to
contract?
the
--
the
section
as
it
passed
does
--
said
nothing
about
requirement
of
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
pass
just
as
it
was
at
the
time
mr.
rankin
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
this
--
this
statute
itself
uses
the
language
that
including
money
and
chooses
an
action
owned
by
him
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
not
dispose
of
otherwise
shall
immediately
vest
in
and
become
the
property
of
the
united
states
as
trustee
for
the
sole
and
benefit
of
the
fund,
how
could
he
say
that
consistently
with
this
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
--
this
section,
does
it
say
anything
about
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
--
i
do
not
see
where
the
act
as
it
is
now
rest
on
the
contract
than
this
one
looked
so
over
that
strange
language
about
presuming
the
contract
exist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
language
in
17
says
it
shall
vest
and
then
says
that
these
provisions
that
conditional
precedent
to
the
initial
offer
of
the
further
furnishing
of
care
to
a
veteran.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
do
not
quite
understand
congressman
rankin's
statement
unless
the
bill
was
different
at
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
base
the
states'
(inaudible)
on
its
power
to
control
the
devolution
of
properties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
power
of
the
state
to
govern
the
property
of
a
veteran,
who
is
supported
by
the
government,
is
greater
than
the
power
of
the
state
over
an
alien,
that
the
government
might
determine
where
his
property
would
go?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
was
talking
about
the
constitutional
power
problem
you
raised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
undoubtedly
true
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
government
can
--
can
overwrite
the
state
law
with
reference
to
the
devolution
of
property
of
an
alien.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
have
less
power
with
reference
to
a
veteran,
a
veteran
who
is
under
its
care?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
understand
that.
