protected
in
any
way?
justice

could
you
get

justice

c.
clark
well,
you
have
a
little
ornamental
band
around
it,
don't
you?
justice

(inaudible)
not
as
wide

with
a
fringe
on
the

but
it's
a

leak
in
about
since
i
had
11
years.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'm
happy
to
know
that.
[laughter]
i
wondered
though,
about
five
years
ago,
you
know
the
weather
up
here
in
washington
was
bad
on
the
(inaudible)
when
you
have
to
park
outside
and
i
commenced
gangs
and
leaks
in
mine
and
so
i
took
it
down,
i
saw
some
ads
in
the
paper
and
i
took
it
down
to
get
it
replaced
rather
than
they
said
that
they
could
sew
some
fabric
over
these
holes
that
--
that
they
thought
it
should
be
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
wouldn't
be
practical.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
i
put
a
new
one
would
that
be
--
i'll
assume
when
i
got
your
top.
that
would
be
a
--
an
infringement
wouldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
although
my
old
top
was
worn
out
it
leaked
on
me.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
he
said
that
they
talked
so
much
to
put
the
new
fabric
door
at
the
holes,
so
worn
parts
where
you
put
it
down
and
on
--
at
the
--
had
the
tendency
to
crack,
when
the
weather
makes
it
leak.
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
would
not
be
practical
because
the
leak
would
come
into
the
sewing
the
thread
and
also
that
it
would
cost
so
much
to
take
the
top
off
and
--
and
sew
it,
would
it
cheaper
for
me
to
buy
another
top?
justice
tom
c.
clark
can
you
buy
a
pattern
of
your
top,
a
--
a
paper
pattern
like
i
would've
addressed,
if
i
went
to
dressing
making.
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
that
be
an
infringement?

justice
tom
c.
clark
you
mean,
you
could
--
you
wouldn't
as
one
man
you
know,
talked
about
the
one
main
top
as
well.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well
and
i
used
to
have
one
and
they
call
one
man,
it
took
about
six
men
(inaudible)
one
man
to
put
it
down
run
though
as
an
automatic
before
a
little
a
lever,
first
(inaudible)
over
the
windshield.
justice
tom
c.
clark
put
that
back
and
when
you
--
i
could
get
out
and
put
a
cover
it,
i
don't
ever
do
that
thing.
justice
tom
c.
clark
oh,
i
have
a
car
that
goes
all
the
whole
thing
when
it
gets
down
but
i'd
already
put
mine
up.
your
patent
is
on
the
automatic
feature
in
the

justice
tom
c.
clark
which
means
yours
is
--
your
patent
cover
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
to
do
it
manually,
you
can
do
it
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
it
does
have
to
deal
with
the
mechanism
that
makes
go
up
and
down.
