from

chief

would
you
make
any
--
any
distinction
at
all
between
the
case
where
the
top
is
changed
for

reasons
or
on

or
because
the
--
the
owner
thinks
it's
worn
out?
chief

i
like
to
--
i
like
to
hear
your
question
asked
--
answer
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
can
answer
it
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'd
like
to
--
excuse
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
fixes
that
standard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
--
i've
been
wondering
why
you
say
that
filament
in
edison's
lamp
was
the
--
was
the
only
functional
thing
in
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
have
an
electric
lamp
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
flexibility
in
the
permissible
repair
doctrine,
so
far
as
the
type
of
patent
is
concerned
in
this
respect?
if
you
have
a
combination
patent,
one
of
the--
one
of
the
elements
in
the
patent
is
in
all
likelihood
to
become
obsolete
or
to
--
or
to
calling
this
repair
before
the
rest
of
it
does?
do
you
hold
them
--
do
you
hold
the
owner
to
the
same
degree
of
--
of
--
under
the
permissible
repair
doctrine
that
you
would
where
they
were
all
of
the
same
type
of
material
and
--
and
one
is
part
is
likely
to
wear
out
as
another
or
some
of
your,
some
of
these
is
a
metal,
some
of
it
is
fabric
and
the
fabric
we
know
is
very
likely
to
--
to
wear
out
before
the
length
of
a
--
of
a
car
and
the
metal
parts
are
--
are
not
likely
to
do
that,
is
there
any
room
for
distinction
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
will
you
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
but
i
want
to
take
--
i
--
i
want
to
assume
that
it
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
they
--
did
they
permit
the
replacement
of
those
knives?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
