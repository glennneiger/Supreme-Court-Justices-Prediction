when
does
it
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
are
you
shaping
at
the
thing
that
the
inventors
were
in
the
main
discovery
was
the
fact
that
it
didn't
have
to
use
snaps?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
its
shape
produces
snaps?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean,
no
other
shape
can
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
it
removed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
worn
out
to
a
certain
extent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
dispose
of
--
suppose
a
man
bought
it
and
the
car
that
he
didn't
actually
check
on
it
or
the
color
or
something.
--
justice
hugo

black
brand
new
--
brand
new
and
then
he
wanted
to
get
a
new
garment
with
a
different
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
--
would
that
violate
this
patent
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
--
so
if
the
spark
plug
are
not
patented,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
part
of
the
automobile.
justice

you

of
your
brief.
justice

l.
black
blue
one,
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i've
seen
there
are
some
photographs
in
here.
could
you
point
out
the
one
that's
a
photograph
of
this
part
that
you
are
talking
about
--
see
it
if
you
have
a
photograph
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
just
noticed
there
are
a
lot
of
photographs
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
wondering
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
any
of
them
show
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
is
it
made?
how
is
the
fabric
made?
is
it
a
regular
fabric
that
you
buy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
other
words,
the
material
itself
(inaudible)
or
the
way
it's
made
has
nothing
to
with
what
you're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
one
--
when
they
make
it,
what
do
they
do?
these
people
that
are
selling
it
that
you
claim
are
infringing
your
patent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
you
object
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
buy
something
that
is
patented?
he
can't
change
if
he
wants
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
nothing
but
a
combination
of
patents
on
it,
about
elements
that
are
non-patentable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
buy
a
suite
of
clothes
or
are
there
ever
any
clothes
patented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
patents
where
they
have
this
new
fangled-thing
they
use
instead
of
buttons?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
use
the
old
type
of
the
zipper,
but
use
the
--
also
the
old
type
of
patent
on
the
dresses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
use
the
pattern
there,
a
rose
pattern,
they
didn't
like
in
one
of
the
places,
they
want
to
take
it
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
go
buy
it
or
would
they
have
to
buy
it
from
the
person
to
whom
--
who
had
the
patent
on
the
dress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you've
just
said
a
while
ago,
shape
doesn't
need
to
be
patented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
get
that,
if
you
mean
language
is
not
adequate
to
describe
the
shape
that
you
don't
want
patented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
you
can
go
and
picture
the
shape
and
they're
frequently
drawn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
picture
of
the
shape
in
your
patent
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
the
only
pictures
that
we
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
any
about
that.
now,
which
part
of
that
is
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
top?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
tried
to
say
that
i
understand
if
you
can
patch
it
but
you
can't
buy
a
new
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
it
patched
by
somebody,
if
you
could
patch
it
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
what
you
--
that's
the
reason
i
asked
for
the
(inaudible).
i
--
i
haven't
yet
quite
understood
it
if
it
has
been
so
important
as
what
you
have
done
(inaudible)
or
you
had
to
get
out,
i've
noticed
that
many
times,
these
sides
or
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you've
made
that
through
its
sounds
you
don't
have
to
do
this.
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
solid
thing
instead
of
one
where
you
have
flaps
and
have
to
be
fastened
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
else
that
you've
done,
except
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
fixed
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
long
--
as
long
--
another
shape
wrecked
can
be
sewn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
you
got
rid
of
the
snaps.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
it.
(voice
overlap)
to
discover.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
mean
by
automatic
seal,
you
don't
mean
the
automatic
operation
with
the
top.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
--
that
it
--
without
turning
in
the
snap,
if
it
starts
to
rain,
you
can
put
that
down,
you
don't
have
to
turn
in
the
snaps
but
it's
a
solid
cover.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
the
whole
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
many
have
presented
here,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
like
the
difference
in
a
man
who
has
the
car
and
had
lot
of
scratches
on
them.
some
of
them
are
fastidious
and
we
get
it
painted,
some
of
them
don't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
the
question
of
what
does
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
issue.
that's
the
issue
and
maybe
that
is
a
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
it's
what
that
means,
it's
you
repair
or
you
would
reconstruct
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
decide
what
reconstruction
means.
justice
hugo

black
why?
