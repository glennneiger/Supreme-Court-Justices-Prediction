mr.
david
wolf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
patent
infringement
suit
brought
by
the
respondent
to
get
the
petitioner
for
infringement
of
the
mackie-duluk
patent.
that
was
held
valid
and
infringed
by
the
district
court
which
also
held
contributorily
infringed
and
no
misuse
was
found.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision.
the
mackie-duluk
patent
relates
to
a
combination
of
elements
in
a
convertible
car
construction.
the
patent
comprises
the
body
of
a
car
withholding
both
structures
supported
on
the
body
of
a
car,
a
fabric
on
the
bow
structure
extending
down
into
the
car
and
secured
within
the
body
of
the
car
just
below
the
bodyline.
a
wiper
arm
supported
on
the
holding
bow
mechanism
is
used
to
force
the
fabric
ultimately
against
the
body
of
the
car
in
order
to
affect
the
watertight
seal
at
the
bodyline.
the
patent
relates
specifically
to
the
means
for
affecting
this
automatic
seal
at
the
bodyline
of
the
car
in
order
to
prevent
water
from
entering.
the
fabric
itself
was
cleaned
in
a
combination
of
elements.
every
claim
in
the
patent
related
to
the
combination
of
holding
bow
mechanism,
the
body
of
the
car,
the
wiper
on
and
the
fabric
in
a
specific
operative
relationship.
it
was
never
claimed
in
the
patent.
it
was
never
claimed
in
the
file
--
in
the
prosecution
of
patent
to
the
fabric
itself.
the
combination
was
embodied
in
the
general
motor
cars
from
1950
to
1953
and
at
some
models
in
1954.it
was
also
incorporated
from
1952
to
1954
portion
of
the
cars.
the
fabric
itself
was
the
only
wearable
component
of
a
patented
combination.
the
other
elements
were
found
to
be
relatively
permanent
and
would
normally
last
the
life
of
the
car.
the
fabric
would
wear
and
would
normally
be
replaced
for
every
three
years.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
automotive
industry,
the
automobile
manufacturers
were
not
interested
in
the
replacement
of
these
fabrics.
consequently,
they're
sizable
replacement
fabric
industry
in
which
these
manufacturers
make
these
fabrics
for
replacement
purposes.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
in
massachusetts
corporation
and
partnership
or
perhaps
the
national
leaders
in
this
particular
replacement
field,
they
have
been
making
these
fabrics
and
selling
them
at
kit
form
for
installation
for
a
number
of
years.
these
kits
are
sold
to
distributors
and
jobbers
who
in
turn
install
it.
all
that
is
sold
is
the
fabric
for
installation.
the
kits
include
primarily
the
fabric
especially
designed
to
fit
the
general
motor
and
ford
cars.
the
petition
themselves
except
for
incidental
installation
occasionally
for
test
purposes
in
a
very,
very
small
amount
of
regular
replacement
don't
do
any
installations.
the
respondent
--
mr.
david
wolf
the
fabric
--
the
fabric
is
a
--
is
--
looks
like
any
conventional
fabric
top
for
an
automobile.
it
has
a
flop
or
a
prolongation
at
the
sides
which
extend
into
the
body
of
the
car
and
it's
secured
there
by
hinds
on
a
truck
so
that
when
water
comes
down
at
the
top
of
the
car,
if
it
isn't
stop
behind
the
pressure
of
the
wiper
arm
against
the
fabric
and
the
body,
it'll
be
taken
up
to
destruct
and
drain
out.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
the
fabric
itself
was
not,
if
i
assume
the
question
correctly,
is
not
itself
unique
in
shape.
the
record
shows
it
was
prior
at
which
had
this
particular
shape
although
not
specifically
the
same
dimensions.
the
--
mr.
david
wolf
of
the
patent
itself?
mr.
david
wolf
the
shape
of
the
--
well,
the
shape
of
the
top
is
fashionably
shown
on
page
589
and
figure
1
of
the
patent.
i
call
to
your
attention
that
in
figure
1
of
the
patent,
only
a
portion
of
the
entire
fabric
top
is
shown.
in
other
words,
there
was
never
a
disclosure
of
a
complete
fabric
top,
only
the
fragmentary
portion
of
it.
if
the
court
is
interested
in
--
in
embodiment
of
an
installation,
there
are
several
of
them.
perhaps
he
could
look
at
page
531
which
shows
an
exhibit
looking
from
the
inside
of
the
car.
you
can
see
that
the
flap
is
detached
at
the
lower
end
there.
the
bar
going
across
just
above
the
individual's
hand
is
that
this
wiper
arm
which
form
the
part
of
the
patent
combination.
mr.
david
wolf
we're
looking
from
the
trunk
of
the
car
through
the
back
window.
there
--
the
--
the
respondent
corporation
is
apparently
a
patentable
incorporation
that
owns
only
a
territorial
right
in
this
patent
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
it
was
organized
approximately
22
days
before
the
suit
was
brought.
it
received
a
territorial
assignment
in
the
patent
to
massachusetts
only
about
10
days
before
the
suit
was
--
was
brought.
it
received
this
assignment,
this
territorial
assignment
from
another
patent
owning
company
called
automobile
body
research.
automobile
body
research
had
a
--
had
a
companion
patent
to
this
particular
patent.
automobile
body
also
had
a
number
of
--
well,
had
several
licenses
outstanding,
had
one
with
general
motors
and
one
with
the
ford
motor
company.
both
of
these
licenses
call
for
payment
of
royalties
on
this
unpatented
fabric
when
it
was
--
when
they
were
sold
as
replacements.
and
these
--
these
royalties
or
the
--
the
requirement
of
royalties
was
paid
with
--
with
a
condition
as
long
as
the
license
was
granted.
the
fact
that
the
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case
manufactures
fabrics
for
replacement
purposes
brings,
into
a
question,
a
well-known
doctrine
as
to
whether
or
not
a
user,
and
consequently
a
manufacturer,
has
the
right
to
maintain
and
repair
patented
combination.
the
government
is
going
to
present
use
with
respect
to
that
particular
issue.
as
i
understand
the
government's
position
is
that
a
user,
and
consequently
a
supplier,
of
unpatented
replacement
fabrics
has
the
right
to
make
those
replacements
without
payment
of
further
royalties.
once
the
patent
owner
has
acquired
or
has
received
payments
of
the
patented
combination
and
once
that
original
installations
passed
monopoly.
we're
primarily
concerned
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
the
right
to
sell
fabrics
for
any
purpose
or
whether
the
patent
can
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
this
unpatented
fabric
which
was
never
claimed
during
the
--
at
any
time.
a
patent
defines
an
exception
to
the
antitrust
laws.
this
exception
is
in
particularly
defined
by
the
claims
of
the
invention,
by
the
claims
which
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
--
the
patent
itself.
it's
long
been
held
by
this
court
in
many
decisions
starting
with
the
motion
picture
patent
case
going
down
through
carbice
--
carbice
case
and
most
recently
with
the
mercoid
case,
cannot
use
a
patent
to
control
the
sale
of
unpatented
component
of
that
particular
patented
combination.
even
though
that
particular
patent
component
was
an
essential
element
and
even
though,
in
some
instances,
it
was
termed
the
heart
of
the
invention.
the
congress
recognizing
importance
of
this
particular
requirement,
the
requirement
of
an
inventor
to
find
specific
terms
of
what
he
claims
his
invention.
they
did
this
by
enacting
a
whole
title,
title
35.
in
this
particular
title,
is
the
requirement
of
the
inventor
set
forth
in
his
application
that
which
he
claims
his
invention
must
be
defined
specifically
and
clearly,
the
examiners
and
the
patent
office
will
clearly
--
will
look
at
the
--
this
particular
claim
or
these
claims
whatever
is
submitted
and
examine
the
file
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
an
invention.
and
the
way
they
do
it
is
they
look
at
this
particular
claim
or
the
claims
above,
they
draw
themselves
a
picture
of
what's
described.
and
then
they
go
and
look
through
what
--
what's
defined
queer
eye.
in
other
words,
this
--
this
claim
is
a
word
picture
of
the
invention.
now,
if
the
claim
doesn't
describe
a
particular
element,
the
patent
examiners
won't
look
for
it
and
that's
just
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
patent
never
looked
for
the
fabric
alone
because
it
was
never
claimed.
the
claims
also
served
other
functions.
they
served
the
function
in
telling
the
public
what
they
can
make
and
what
can't
make.
they
also
serve
the
function
of
telling
the
inventor
what
he
can
--
what
he
use
as
a
charge
for
infringement
or
what
he
can't
use
as
a
charge
of
infringement.
now,
respondent
in
this
particular
case
says,
"well,
we
don't
have
to
squabble
with
this
claim
because
this
fabric
is
an
element
of
the
patented
combination
and
it's
an
important
element
of
patented
combination.
now,
we
can
come
in
under
the
statute
35
u.s.c.
which
says,
"if
you
make
a
material
part
of
a
patented
combination
and
it's
not
a
staple
or
a
commodity
of
commerce,
we're
entitled
to
monopolize
it."
but
let's
take
a
look
at
this
35
u.s.c.
271
--
pardon
me,
271
--
271
(c).
this
appears
on
page
76
of
our
brief.
now,
the
language
paraphrasing
it
is
whoever
sells
a
component
of
a
patented
machine,
constituting
a
material
part
of
the
invention,
knowing
the
same
to
be
especially
made
or
especially
adapted
for
use
in
an
infringement
of
such
patent
and
not
a
staple
article
or
commodity
of
commerce
suitable
for
substantial
noninfringing
use,
shall
be
liable
as
a
contributory
infringement."
now,
the
keywords
we
believe
in
this
particular
statute
are
the
phrases
"material
part"
and
also
the
phrase
"suitable
for
substantial
noninfringing
use".
now,
you
can
interpret
the
word
"material
part"
to
mean
a
single
unpatented
essential
element
with
patented
combination.
but
the
real
question
is,
was
this
the
purpose
of
that
particular
phrase?
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
271
(c),
it's
perfectly
clear
that
congress
intended
to
codify
existing
case
law.
271
(c)
was
not
intended
to
make
new
law.
and
in
codifying
prior
existing
case
law,
the
congress
codified
several
cases.
mr.
david
wolf
july
4th,
1952.
now,
the
cases
--
mr.
david
wolf
yes.
the
cases
--
which
congress
had
called
to
its
attention
during
this
legislative
history
--
during
this
legislative
history,
this
particular
bill
are
very
interesting
because
there
are
four
cases
which
caught
their
attention.
two
of
them
illustrated,
in
our
opinion,
a
proper
setting
for
contributory
infringement
and
two
of
them
were
illustrative
of
--
of
a
situation
which
should
not
be
contributory
infringement.
mr.
david
wolf
no.
mr.
david
wolf
no.
mr.
david
wolf
no.
2
--
271
--
mr.
david
wolf
the
statute
was
declaratory.
mr.
david
wolf
i
believe
senator
saltonstall,
when
this
came
to
a
vote
asked
that
specific
question
and
senator
mccarran
said,
"it
is
a
codification."
in
the
house
of
committee
--
house
of
senate
committee
reports
will
indicate
it.
now
--
mr.
david
wolf
i
don't
believe
so.
in
the
respondent's
brief,
he
has
made
the
specific
statement
that
the
clear
and
concise
definition
of
contributory
infringement
now
in
the
statute
and
every
element
of
that
definition
represents
no
more
than
a
codification
of
what
is
long
and
consistently
believed
and
recognized
as
contributory
infringement.
so
i
don't
believe
that
they
are
contesting
that
issue.
but
the
four
cases,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention,
of
the
mercoid
case
and
the
carbice
case
which
i
think
clearly
indicate
what
is
not
contributory
infringement.
now,
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
we
have
two
lower
court
decisions
which
were
called
to
the
committee's
attention
and
they're
referred
to
our
--
in
our
brief.
one
is
the
wallace
versus
holmes
case,
the
other
is
the
amalgamated
dental
case.
and
these
cases
considered
what
this
word
"material
part"
is.
i'd
like
to
first
mention
this
wallace
versus
holmes
case
because
that
particular
case
was
a
very
early
case.
it
was
discussed
in
the
committee
reports.
that
particular
case
had
a
--
had
a
claim
relating
to
a
lamp
burner
mechanism.
if
--
the
claim
is
reproduced
in
our
reply
brief,
on
page
5,
the
bottom
of
page
5.
now,
this
particular
claim
recited
a
lot
of
elements
in
a
lamp
burner
mechanism
with
a
glass
chimney
which
was
especially
designed
to
fit.
the
defendant
in
that
particular
case
made
everything
but
the
glass
chimney.
the
court
in
that
case
said
this
is
an
infringement.
well,
they
didn't
it
was
an
infringement.
they
said
this
is
a
virtual
infringement
because
the
defendant
here
is
making
substantially
everything
but
the
background
element
of
the
glass
chimney.
and
so
we're
going
to
hold
them
liable.
it's
interesting
to
note
in
this
case,
this
was
the
very
first
instance
of
the
word
--
to
use
the
word
"material".
and
the
committee
reports,
they
--
they
indicate
that
this
was
a
part
of
our
law
for
80
years.
and
this
was
an
1871
case,
so
i
suspect
that
the
court
may
have
had
reference
to
this
particular
case
when
they
were
considering
what
material
was.
but
you
see
here,
there
was
a
making
of
substantially
the
entire
combination.
there
was
not
a
making
of
a
single
element
or
the
sale
of
a
single
element.
the
other
case
that
was
caught
to
the
committee's
attention
was
amalgamated
dental
case.
there
was
a
case
in
which
there
were
four
chemicals
in
making
a
solution.
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
selling
four
chemicals
without
the
aqueous
solution.
and
the
judge
in
that
case
recognized
that
they
were
making
substantially
the
patented
invention
except
for
the
background
element
of
the
aqueous
solution.
and
they
said
--
the
judge
said,
"i'm
going
to
hold
the
defendant
liable
on
this
particular
case
because
he
is
making
the
substance
of
the
invention."
and
incidentally,
in
that
case,
the
judge
on
the
district
court
never
recognized
that
this
was
different
than
mercoid.
now,
those
are
the
two
cases
which
illustrate
what
contributory
infringement
should
be.
now,
what
contributory
infringement
should
not
be
was
decided
several
times
by
this
court.
one
is
the
carbice
case
and
one
is
the
mercoid
case.
perhaps
i
--
i
ought
to
consider
the
mercoid
case
first
because
this
--
that
case,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
is
undistinguishable
in
all
respects
from
this
particular
situation.
in
the
mercoid
case,
the
patent
related
to
a
furnace
system
in
which
one
of
the
elements
was
a
specially
designed
thermostat
which
was
alleged
to
be
the
heart
of
the
invention.
now,
the
mercoid
corporation
was
selling
these
especially
designed
switches.
they
were
suit
for
contributory
infringement.
in
that
case,
this
court
said
the
attempt
to
hold
mercoid
and
the
attempt
to
control
the
sale
of
these
unpatented
components
is
a
misuse
of
the
patent
and
they
refused
to
enforce
them.
the
carbice
case
is
also
similar.
in
that
case,
there
was
patent
on
the
combination
of
the
--
of
dry
ice
and
the
package
in
which
the
dry
ice
was
packed.
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
selling
dry
ice
with
the
knowledge
that
it
was
being
used
in
a
particular
patented
combination.
there,
the
court
said
you
can't
control
an
unpatented
component.
now,
we
believe
all
these
cases
clearly
in
this
--
illustrate
that
the
word
"material"
in
this
particular
context
really
means
the
substance
of
the
patented
invention
minus,
perhaps,
a
background
element.
i
think
if
you'll
look
at
it
in
that
term,
you
will
--
you
will
see
that
this
particular
statute
does
make
some
sense.
if
you
interpret
it
to
mean
an
unpatented
component
even
though
it's
essential,
you
see
it
implying
in
the
face
of
the
rest
of
the
statute
which
--
which
set
up
a
very
elaborate
system
for
examining
these
--
these
claims.
if
you
say
we're
going
to
protect
this
unpatented
component
what
you're
saying
is
that
every
man
can
be
his
own
patent
office
and
every
man
by
virtue
of
going
into
a
--
the
patent
office
in
getting
a
claim
and
a
combination
adding
some
element
has
--
can
thereby
acquire
a
right
to
control
the
individual
components
all
be
it
not
themselves
inventions
and
not
patented.
i'd
like
to
go
one
step
further
than
--
on
this
point
on
contributory
infringement.
that
is
the
actions
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
now,
the
facts
stated
in
our
brief
are
fairly
complete
on
this
particular
point.
but
if
you
--
in
the
--
in
the
record
you
will
see
there
are
several
licensing
agreements.
one
is
with
ford,
one
is
with
general
motors
and
one
is
with
atlas
international,
a
competitor
of
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
case.
now,
all
of
these
licensing
agreements
conditioned
the
right
to
continue
the
use
of
patented
combination
upon
an
agreement
to
pay
a
royalty
on
the
--
on
the
unpatented
fabrics.
the
language,
for
example,
in
the
atlas
international
agreement
says,
"licensee
will
pay
a
royalty
on
any
replacement
top
made,
used
or
sold
by
a
licensee
without
regard
to
whether
such
top
is
covered
by
either
of
the
patents
which
by
its
peculiar
shape
or
the
construction
is
adapted
to
use
in
one
or
more
of
the
following
cars."
there's
a
whole
long
list
of
these
cars.
and
there
are
some
other
requirements
in
this
particular
agreement.
now,
the
evil
--
mr.
david
wolf
no
--
the
petitioner
has
consistently
refused
to
take
out
a
license.
and
i
might
say
that
is
to
the
detriment
of
the
petitioner
because
there
is
--
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
--
that
--
that
one
of
the
individuals
associated
with
the
arsenal
corporation
was
writing
letters
to
possible
purchases
of
this
fabric
saying,
"don't
buy
from
anyone
that
hasn't
got
a
license.
buy
from
atlas
international,
they
have
a
license."
and
we
believe
this
is
a
very
clear
showing
of
substantial
damage
to
the
--
to
the
petitioner.
we
believe
that
this
case
comes
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
international
salt
case
and
that
there
has
been
a
clear
showing
of
violations
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act.
we
--
we
believe
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
attempt
to
monopolize
the
sale
of
unpatented
fabrics.
and
in
this
particular
area
of
commerce,
it's
a
--
not
an
insubstantial
area
at
all.
in
the
record,
there
was
evidence
of
the
amount
of
royalties
of
this
atlas
international
has
paid.
and
in
one
year
alone,
these
royalties
amounted
to
$14,000.
now,
if
you
calculate
the
amount
of
tops
necessary
to
generate
$14,000
worth
of
royalties
under
their
particular
licensing
agreement,
you
come
up
with
a
fee
of
something
close
to
a
half
a
million
dollars.
this,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
is
a
very
substantial
area
of
commerce
which
the
--
which
--
which
has
been
monopolized
or
which
has
attempted
to
--
be
monopolized.
mr.
david
wolf
you
are
hiring
a
local
--
a
local
trimmer
making
--
mr.
david
wolf
a
replacement
fabric.
mr.
david
wolf
according
--
according
to
this
particular
decree,
you
would
be
infringing.
mr.
david
wolf
according
to
the
--
according
to
the
respondent,
no.
according
to
respondent,
even
though
you
still
have
the
full
mechanism,
the
body
of
the
car,
i
mean
this
wiper
arm
and
even
though
your
fabric
may,
perhaps,
be
perfectly
alright
in
this
little
--
little
"prolongationary"
within
the
car
and
even
though
the
--
and
even
though
that
all
it
might
be
wrong
is
someone
slashed
the
top
in
an
area
not
even
shown
in
the
patented
combination,
you
would
be
infringing.
mr.
david
wolf
well,
our
--
our
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
--
the
automobile
body
research
corporation
signed
an
agreement
with
the
ford
motor
company.
that
agreement
purports
to
be
a
release
rather
than
a
license
but
i
say
that
it
is
immaterial
as
to
what
you've
defined
it.
and
the
important
point
was
that
automobile
body
got
paid.
and
as
soon
as
they
got
paid,
for
--
for
this
particular
--
this
particular
--
for
instance,
their
monopoly
rights
in
that
patented
combination
ended
and
they
had
no
more
right
to
claim
anything
with
respect
to
those
particular
combinations
which
were
--
which
was
sold
and
which
were
released
by
that
particular
agreement.
there
is
a
further
answer
to
your
question
and
that
answer
is
that
--
that
if
this
court
holds
that
the
general
motor
corporation
replacement
fabrics
or
fabrics
for
those
particular
cars
were
--
were
improperly
made
the
subject
matter
of
this
licensing
agreement,
then
there
has
been
a
misuse
and
that
in
--
in
view
of
this
misuse,
the
respondent
has
no
right
under
the
morton
salt
case,
enforces
patent.
there
are
--
there
are
two
other
issues
which
we
have
raised
and
i
would
just
like
to
briefly
allude
to
them
because
they
are
fairly
well
spelled
out
in
our
brief.
the
first
is
that
since
this
is
a
patent
and
since
this
is
an
exception
to
the
antitrust
laws,
the
patent
was
--
or
an
exception
to
antitrust
laws,
a
patent
owner
is
subjecting
himself
when
he
comes
to
the
court
with
much
greater
scrutiny
as
to
his
equitable
content.
we
called
to
your
attention.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
obviously
going
to
shell
corporation.
and
in
our
opinion,
obviously
formed
as
a
shell
corporation
to
dodge
--
to
dodge
discovery
proceedings
and
this
--
this
would
clearly
was
the
case
when
we
tried
to
find
out
certain
facts
and
also
for
the
purpose
of
isolating
the
companion
to
that.
now,
we
believe
that
this
is
an
equitable
content
which
should
not
be
tolerated
in
a
patent
case.
when
a
man
comes
in
to
court
with
a
patent,
he
should
be
made
to
put
it
on
the
line.
he
should
be
made
to
stand
up
and
say,
"this
is
my
invention.
i
am
going
to
be
subject
to
the
scrutiny
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
good
patent."
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
take
part
of
that
patent
and
hide
it
in
a
separate
corporation
so
that
it
would
still
collect
royalties
on
it.
there
is
also
a
constitutional
issue
involved
which
i
think
we
spelled
out
in
our
brief
which
would
not
be
met
by
this
court
unless
they
found
that
the
interpretation
on
271
(c)
reached
by
the
respondent
is
the
correct
interpretation.
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
david
wolf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
first,
i
like
to
clarify
a
few
--
few
of
the
facts
involved
in
this
case.
the
fabric
shape
itself
was
not
new.
the
court
specifically
found
that,
the
district
court,
where
it's
set
at
page
36
to
the
record
(inaudible)
mr.
david
wolf
--
brought
the
fabric
from
outside
the
tunnel
of
the
rear
quarter
--
mr.
david
wolf
36,
brought
the
fabric
from
outside
the
tunnel
with
the
rear
quarter
inside.
this
in
itself
was
not
new.
i'd
also
like
to
remark
that
it's
quite
remarkable
that
the
respondent
never
once
mentioned
during
his
entire
presentation
of
the
wiper
arm.
the
wiper
arm,
when
it
--
this
case
was
presented
to
the
district
court,
was
argued
as
a
very
essential
element.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
--
testimony
in
page
171
of
the
record,
when
i
was
cross-examining
the
expert
of
the
respondent
speaking
about
the
various
parts
that
went
into
this
invention.
i
said,
you
mean
to
say
that
the
tonneau
and
the
fabric
and
the
wiper
arm
and
the
folding
bows
are
all
necessary
in
this?
answer,
yes,
without
all
those
parts,
you
don
have
a
complete
operating
unit.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
other
spots
in
the
record
which
clearly
indicate
this.
i'd
like
to
refer
the
page
26
of
the
record
which
indicates
that
the
respondent's
contentions
with
respect
to
wearability
were
disregarded
by
the
trial
court.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
that
on
the
--
that
with
respect
to
the
cases
the
respondent
relies
upon,
there
is
not
one
case
except
leeds
&
catlin
that
was
decided
by
this
court
and
leeds
&
catlin
was
specifically
overruled
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
that
was
before
congress
when
decided
the
statute.
the
--
the
responded
has
also
indicated
that
he
couldn't
claim
the
fabric
per
se
or
i
believe
that
i
could
orally
state
a
claim
right
now
but
to
claim
that
fabric
per
se
if
--
if
we
had
to,
but
leeds
&
catlin
perhaps
is
not
(inaudible),
is
not
necessarily
(inaudible)
in
view
of
special
equipment
versus
coe,
which
clearly
indicated,
the
one
could
claim
as
a
sub-combination,
a
single
element.
i
repeat
that
there
is
not
one
case
to
my
knowledge
including
the
davis
case
which
really
held
that
a
single
component
could
be
monopolized
and
when
that
component
was
merely
one
component
of
(inaudible)
combination.
finally,
i'd
like
to
indicate
that
we
believe
there
are
number
base
--
bases
upon
which
this
case
could
decided.
we
believe
the
case
should
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
misuse
because
this
respondent
has
been
substantially
--
this
petitioner
as
been
substantial
injured
by
this
(inaudible)
case.
and
we
believe
that's
--
if
this
case
is
decided
on
the
grounds
of
misuse,
the
--
the
petitioner
will
then
have
the
opportunity
of
trying
to
recover
of
some
of
the
damages
which
it
has
sustained.
it
had
--
its
credit
has
been
completely
tied
up
for
several
years
because
of
the
injunction.
there
had
been
attachments
on
the
business,
all
the
working
capital,
the
personal
homes
of
the
individuals.
this
is
just
the
sort
of
thing
which
the
antitrust
laws
were
designed
to
avoid.
this
was
a
business.
it
was
35-years
old.
people
that
were
running
it
had
been
making
fabrics,
cutting
them
in
substantially
the
same
manner
to
(inaudible)
the
automotive
trade
of
many
years
and
this
patent
comes
along
and
the
combination
patent
is
now
used
to
try
to
stop
this
business
which
should
--
which
had
been
continuing
for
these
many
years.
thank
you.
