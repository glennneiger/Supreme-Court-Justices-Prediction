mr.
wolf,
where
in
the
--
where
in
the
appendix
we'll
get
the
best
picture
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
this
--
of
this
top
and
of
the
shape
of
the
top.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
which
direction
are
we
looking
at?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wolf,
might
place
is
here
to
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
not
depend
upon
whether
the
top
for
--
on
a
ford
or
on
an
automobile
because
i
understand
this
case,
general
motors
had
a
license,
it's
arguable
at
least
that
its
purchasers
had
--
had
implied
licenses
on
the
other
hand,
ford
motor
company
did
not
have
a
license
and
therefore,
its
purchasers
did
not
have
had.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
part
of
the
automobile
maker.
justice
potter
stewart
a
contributory
infringement
presumably
on
the
part
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
you're
talking
about
supplying
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
not
--
you're
not
talking
about
supplying
bulks
of
fabric,
you're
talking
about
supplying
a
--
a
completed
fabric,
safe
fabrics
for
this
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
shape
and
design.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
combination
patent.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
statute,
the
question,
the
right
question
is
that
they
are
not
immaterial
part,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
an
important
justification
for
holding
somebody
liable
--
for
--
for
the
whole
doctrine
of
contributory
question
is,
is
it
not
that
--
that
that
comes
into
play
when
the
actual
technical
infringement
has
been
done
by
somebody
who
has
a
difficulty
or
other
reasons
that
it
just
would
not
be
practical
or
practicable
liable
for
direct
infringement
i.e.
the
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
where
the
whole
doctrine
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
not
the
justification
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
make
it
sound
rather
absurd
that
justice
whittaker
would
be
infringing
a
patent
when
he
had
flaps
put
on
his
or
new
tops
on
his
convertible
car
that
would
--
that
would
be
a
technical
infringement.
nobody's
trying
to
hold
the
infringement
and
that's
the
whole
basis
for
--
for
the
doctrine
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
shall
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

try
to
hold
him
liable.
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
what
the
courts
have
said,
common
sense
is
directed
to
as
to
the
basic
question
on
whether
or
not,
its
reconstruction
or
repair.
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
question?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
issue,
which
is
not
