mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
propose
to
do
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
in
order
to
clarify
our
position
in
this
matter
and
in
order
to
be
of
assistance
of
the
court
and
the
problems
before
it,
i
propose
to
divide
my
argument
into
four
main
sections.
first,
i
would
like
to
explain
exactly
what
the
mackie-duluk
patent
is
all
about,
what
problems
it
was
intended
to
solve
and
how
it's
solved.
secondly,
i
will
explain
what
the
patent
on
err,
what
the
both
courts
below
considered
to
be
an
infringement
of
the
patent
and
the
other
side
of
the
coin
what
is
clearly
not
an
infringement
of
this
patent.
third,
i
will
discuss
the
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction.
this
doctrine
which
we
maintain
has
been
in
the
law
for
over
100
years.
this
doctrine
which
we
maintain
was
reenacted
by
congress
in
1952
and
this
doctrine
which
was
the
very
basis
of
both
decisions
below.
and
finally,
as
a
fourth
section
of
my
argument,
i
hope
to
demonstrate
that
what
the
justice
department
is
here
trying
to
do,
is
to
change
the
law
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
1952
and
that
they
are
trying
to
do
that
on
the
basis
of
the
very
arguments
which
they
presented
to
congress
and
which
were
rejected
by
that
body
in
1952.
is
that
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
quite
so;
yes,
yes
and
at
such,
as
it
will
appear,
we
maintain
that
it
has
left
intact
as
the
justice
department
itself
says,
"left
intact,
this
entire
body
of
law."
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
we
agree.
yes,
we
agree
with
the
law
that
left
intact
in
this
question
of
repair
versus
reconstruction.
now
let
us
consider
this
first
question
that
i
mentioned
before
what
is
the
mackie-duluk
patent
all
about?
well,
as
has
been
clearly
stated,
it
is
not
involved
with
the
car.
it
doesn't
concern
a
car
and
it
doesn't
even
concern
a
convertible
car.
it
concerns
as
its
very
title
says,
a
portion
of
the
car,
a
convertible
folding
top
with
an
automatic
seal
at
the
rear
quarter.
it's
concerned
with
one
part
of
the
car,
the
top
structure
and
in
that
event,
a
special
type
of
top
structure,
one,
with
an
automatic
seal
at
the
rear
quarter.
before
proceeding,
i
think,
we
ought
to
have
some
definitions
here.
the
rear
quarter
section
of
the
car
is
the
section
on
the
side
of
the
car
immediately
to
the
rear
of
the
side
windows.
if
you
will
picture
yourself
sitting
in
the
rear
seat
of
the
car
and
if
you
look
immediately
to
the
right
or
the
left
that
is
the
section
of
the
car
we
are
talking
about.
the
section
where
this
court
may
recall
convertible
top
structures
in
the
past,
used
to
have
snap
fasteners.
that
is
the
very
section
of
the
car.
and
--
there's
another
term
that
may
arise
from
time
to
time,
that
is
the
belt
line
of
the
car.
that
is
the
top
of
the
middle
structure
of
the
car,
the
top
of
the
lower
body
of
the
car.
now,
prior
to
the
mackie-duluk
invention,
fabrics
which
were
used
in
inconvertible
cars
were
typically
shaped
so
that
they
terminated
in
his
rear
quarter
section,
immediately
adjacent
or
above
the
belt
line
of
the
car.
and
they
habitually
had
some
sort
of
manual
fasteners
on
them,
like
snap
fasteners
or
a
channel
in
top
arrangement,
so
that
after
the
top
have
been
completely
raised,
this
fabric
in
the
rear
quarter
section
could
be
pulled
down
and
manually
fastened
to
the
belt
line
of
the
car
in
that
region.
perhaps,
the
court
will
recall
such
structures.
they
were
the
typical
structure
prior
to
1950.
now
these
structures
had
been
in
existence
for
a
long
period
of
years.
perhaps
at
least,
50
years
or
so
and
over
this
entire
period
of
time,
everyone
recognized
that
they
had
at
least
three
major
problems.
the
first
problem
of
course,
was
that
they
require,
if
you
will,
a
manual
seal
in
the
rear
quarter
as
distinguished
on
the
automatic
seal
with
which
were
concerned
here.
it
meant
that
even
with
the
advent
of
motors,
motor
driven
structures
to
fold
your
convertible
top
up,
even
after
the
top
had
been
completely
closed
over
the
car,
someone
had
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
walk
around
in
the
side
of
the
car
and
actually
snap
this
fasteners
in
place
to
complete
the
closure
and
this
often
occurred
under
conditions
of
inclimate
weather.
the
second
major
problem
was
a
problem
of
shrinkage
in
this
region.
since
the
fabric
material
in
the
rear
quarter
section
was
loose,
we
found
that
often
after
a
limited
period
of
usage,
even
though
the
top
was
in
fine
condition,
the
material
had
shrunk
a
little
bit
in
this
region
so
that
even
when
you
tried
to
pull
the
fasteners
down,
you
just
couldn't
quite
reach
the
belt
line.
and
as
a
result,
you
just
couldn't
make
a
seal
at
all
in
this
region
of
the
car
and
you
had
some
loose
flaps
so
that
wind
or
snow
or
rain
could
come
into
the
car.
this
was
of
course,
a
major
problem
and
there
was
the
third
problem
which
had
been
discussed
in
the
record
this
problem
of
so-called,
unauthorized
access.
a
convertible
car
can
never
be
reliably
locked
even
now
because
the
top
can
be
slashed,
but
it
was
very
easy
to
get
into
convertible
cars
prior
to
1950,
simply
because
anybody
who
wanted
to
get
into
the
car,
even
when
the
doors
were
locked
and
the
window's
completely
closed,
could
merely
unsnap
these
fasteners
and
reach
into
the
car
at
that
region
and
open
the
door
or
what
have
you.
these
three
problems
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
it's
not
your
honor.
no
--
it's
not.
the
patent
was
found
valid
by
the
trial
court
and
validity
has
never
been
a
question
even
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
here,
but
i
believe
that
this
discussion
is
important
so
that
we
understand
what
the
contribution
was
which
mackie-duluk
made
and
--
and
how
it's
important
here.
these
three
problems
as
they
say
were
recognized
for
some
50
years
and
even
though
the
engineers
--
the
best
engineers
in
the
industry
have
been
working
on
it
diligently,
no
solution
came
up
until
mackie-duluk
finally
came
up
with
a
solution
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
mackie-duluk
solution
can
perhaps,
be
best
appreciated
by
seeing
what
they
didn't
do.
in
the
first
place,
they
made
absolutely
no
change
to
the
car
body,
no
change
to
the
folding
top
structure
at
all.
no
change
i
should
say
to
the
bows
and
the
pillars.
these
were
conventional
linkages
which
were
precisely
the
same
in
mackie-duluk's
convention
as
they
had
been
for
years
before.
what
they
did
do,
was
to
change
the
shape
of
the
fabric
in
this
rear
quarter
section.
they,
rather
than
having
the
fabric
terminate
at
the
belt
line
of
the
car
as
was
the
case
before,
they
caused
the
fabric
to
be
shaped,
so
as
to
extend
deep
inside
of
the
car,
where
it
could
be
permanently
fastened.
and
while
in
retrospect,
this
seems
to
be
a
fairly
simple
approve
--
improvement
now,
actually,
it
was
quite
a
startling
improvement
in
1950.
it
was
an
improvement
which
solved,
if
you
will,
50
years
of
problems.
and
this
simple
change,
this
--
this
one
change
in
the
shaping
of
the
fabric,
brought
a
complete
solution
immediately
to
all
of
these
problems.
now,
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
they
are
mr.
justice
douglas.
the
patent
itself
appears
at
record
page
589.
that's
in
the
large
volume
of
the
record.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
with
this
we
â€“
we
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
--
i
understand
that
that
is
their
argument,
but
the
concurrent
findings
below
were
to
the
contrary.
i
believe
that
the
claim
is
quite
clearly
due
to
define
shape,
but
we
but
understand
them
and
i
might
note
for
the
court's
(inaudible),
if
you
will,
the
court
of
appeals
itself
and
this
is
at
record
page
651,
at
record
page
651,
about
halfway
down
the
first
full
paragraph,
you
will
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
is
a
concurrent
finding
but
the
court
of
appeals
states
it
very
well.
this
is
in
the
--
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
in
the
small
volume,
the
very
small
volume
of
the
record.
you'll
find
that
the
court
of
appeals
there
says
that
shortly
after
the
citation
of
heyer
versus
duplicator,
says
the
mackie-duluk
patent
does
not
broadly
cover
the
fabric
portion
of
the
folding
top
of
any
form
or
shape.
it
specifically
covers
the
fabric
part
of
such
a
top
of
a
particular
form
or
shape.
the
form
or
shape
is
particularly
covered
in
this
fabric
--
in
this
patent,
if
we
could
understand
the
claim.
the
claim
is
difficult
to
read
immediately,
but
they
very
clearly
do
set
forth
this
fabric
shape
and
no
one
has
had
difficulty
below
on
this
question.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
it
is
the
--
it
--
in
essence
the
heart
of
the
invention
if
you
will.
upon
its
removal,
there
is
nothing
left
of
patentable
nature.
it
is
the
thing
which
solved
the
problems.
it
is
the
invention,
if
you
will,
although
it
was
claimed
in
combination
with
other
components
and
this
claiming
in
combination
with
other
components
should
be
understood.
we
have
briefed
this
matter
in
our
brief,
but
when
the
suggestion
is
made
that
the
fabric
shape
could
be
claimed
alone,
this
is
not
correct.
this
--
we
challenge.
the
problems
which
are
involved
in
the
claiming
of
the
thing
like
a
shape
all
by
itself,
were
discussed
at
great
length
before
the
congress
prior
to
1952
and
i
believe
that
this
court
will
appreciate
that
shape
in
the
abstract
is
meaningless.
you
just
cannot
define
a
shape
as
such.
the
shape
becomes
meaningful
only
when
it
is
put
into
its
proper
environment.
and
therefore,
under
these
circumstances,
the
patent
office
itself,
required
that
these
standard
elements
be
put
into
the
claim,
so
that
one
can
understand
exactly
what
this
shape
is,
even
though
these
other
elements
are
not
part
of
the
invention.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i'm
saying
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
would
prefer
to
say
it
that
these
other
parts
are
necessary
to
understand
just
where
the
--
the
parts
of
this
new
shape
go
and
what
they
are
for.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
oh,
perhaps
i
can
understand
--
let
me
anticipate
by
pointing
out
what
these
claims
are
all
about.
if
i
wish
to
define
the
shape
of
a
glove,
i
may
have
great
difficulty
in
defining
it
in
the
abstract.
if
i
start
of
though,
with
a
standard
structure
which
everyone
knows
about
and
then
point
out
that
we
are
concerned
with
a
fabric
which
includes
portions
covering
the
palm
of
the
hand
and
the
rear
of
the
hand
and
portions
encompassing
each
of
the
individual
fingers,
if
you
will.
this
immediately
conjures
up
a
very
clear
picture
of
what
shape
we're
talking
about
even
though
we
have
related
it
to
a
standard
structure
and
we
must
recall
that
in
this
case,
the
car
body,
the
panels,
the
pillars,
the
bows
and
so
forth
that
we
are
talking
about,
are
structures
which
were
well-known
to
everyone
in
this
industry.
these
are
structures
in
which
no
change
was
made.
these
are
common
structures
and
therefore,
when
we
speak
of
this,
a
fabric
in
point
of
the
--
we
point
out
in
these
claims
that
this
fabric
includes
a
portion
which
is
supported
by
the
bows
and
this
immediately,
strikes
a
picture
in
the
minds
of
those
skilled
in
the
art.
it
includes
a
portion
which
spreads
and
adjoins
the
belt
line
of
the
car.
it
includes
another
portion
which
extends
considerably
below
the
belt
line
of
the
car
and
it's
fastened
to
a
panel,
a
common
structure
in
these
cars
which
everybody
knows
about.
in
this
frame
of
reference
therefore,
those
skilled
in
the
art,
immediately
have
a
very
clear
picture
of
what
the
fabric
shape
is
and
indeed,
this
demonstrates
one
of
the
purposes
in
bringing
in
these
other
common
components
for
they
assist
in
the
definition
of
the
shape.
they
make
the
shape
very
clear
to
those
skilled
in
the
art
and
it
must
be
understood
of
course,
that
these
claims
are
directed
to
persons
skilled
in
the
art.
they
--
they
would
not
mean
much
to
a
man
in
the
ice
cream
industry,
if
you
will,
but
to
people
in
the
automobile
industry,
these
are
quite
definite
recitations
of
what
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
it
does
not
your
honor.
those
were
standard
parts
because
they
were
nothing
new.
they
--
they
were
not
new
in
themselves.
they
were,
if
you
will,
stable
--
stable
articles
of
commerce,
to
use
the
term
of
the
statute.
these
--
the
--
the
heart
of
the
invention,
the
inventive
improvement,
the
change
which
mackie-duluk
conceived,
was
in
this
new
shape.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
well,
let
us
refer
to
claim
1,
for
example,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
it
has
flexible
top
material
are
we
looking
at
claim
1?
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
starting
at
about
line
40
there,
you
see
we
have
flexible
top
material
supported
by
the
bows
and
having
the
top
material
at
the
rear
quarter
extending
down
and
supported
by
sub
panel
in
the
inside
and
considerably,
below
the
top
of
the
metal
body
or
tonneau.
this
is
all
a
definition
of
--
of
the
shaping
in
this
rear
quarter.
it's
extension
down
considerably
below
the
top
of
the
metal
body
and
so
forth.
a
claim
such
as
4,
that
define
a
shape
and
--
and
even
other
terms
as
a
flexible
top
material,
this
is
at
claim
4,
at
about
line
17
or
18.
it
says
it
has
flexible
top
material
supported
by
the
bows
and
having
the
top
material
at
the
rear
quarter
extending
down
and
fastened
to
said
panel
on
the
inside
and
below
the
top
of
the
metal
body
or
tonneau,
a
portion
of
said
top
material
spreading
and
adjoining
the
inside
of
the
top
of
the
side
of
the
tonneau
when
the
bow
structure
is
raised
and
so
forth.
this
sounds
like
a
lot
of
words,
but
as
i
say
to
those
skilled
in
the
art,
this
conjures
a
very
clear
picture
of
what
we're
talking
about.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
the
--
the
patent
itself,
unfortunately,
because
we
are
talking
about
shape,
it
is
very
difficult
to
explain
what
the
shape
is.
in
--
in
this
respect,
the
courts
below
were
counterfeited
in
the
certain
respects.
the
trial
court
on
two
occasions
adjourned
to
a
nearby
parking
garage
to
actually
abuse
some
of
these
structures
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
actual
tops
before
them.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
don't
believe
so.
it
would
certainly
assist
in
your
understanding
of
the
shaping
consideration
but
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
don't
have
any
cars
here
unfortunately.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
you
mean,
let's
say
a
(inaudible)
top.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
immediately.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
immediately,
without
any
change
of
the
car
whatsoever.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
you
could,
your
honor.
this
is
quite
clear
on
the
record
that
these
car
bodies
and
bows
that
we're
talking
about
are
so
standard.
there
was
no
change
whatsoever,
to
the
car.
one
of
these
old
tops
can
go
on
to
the
car
immediately.
i
believe
that
this
will
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
when
we
put
the
old
top
on,
we
have
our
snap
faster
structures
if
you
will,
which
raise
all
the
problems
that
i
have
mentioned
before.
when
--
when
we
put
on
the
new
shape
on
top,
onto
the
car,
we
no
longer
have
any
of
these
three
problems
that
i've
talked
about
and
this
is
the
virtue
of
the
shaping
and
the
fastening
considerations
that
i'm
talking
about.
i
believe
that
if
we
get
into
--
i
hope
to
explain
in
this
first
section
that
the
essential
novelty
in
this
thing,
the
heart
of
the
invention,
as
it
has
in
termed
in
various
references
and
in
various
cases
which
i
will
discuss,
the
heart
of
the
invention
is
cruxed
in
the
dominant
part
of
it
was
in
this
new
shape
in
this
fabric.
now
this
being
the
case,
let
us
consider
this
second
question.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
well
this
shape
was
the
thing
which
produced
that
result,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no
the
shape
permitting
a
permanent
fasting
deep
within
the
car
permitted
someone
to
eliminate
the
snaps.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
quite
to
the
contrary.
what
happened
was
that
this
--
if
i
may
explain
this
briefly,
when
this
came
out,
it
was
the
first
development
in
this
--
in
this
particular
concept
of
fasting
fabrics
inside
of
a
car
and
mackie-duluk
were,
if
you
will,
a
pioneer.
they
were
pioneers
in
this
field.
their
particular
shape
was
used
only
for
approximately
three
or
four
years
and
building
on
the
structure
as
we
do
in
all
these
new
fields
of
--
of
endeavor
where
the
yankee
ingenuity,
if
you
will,
is
involved,
the
industry
has
since,
dropped
this
shape
completely
and
they've
come
up
with
quite
different
structures
which
are
now
lies
involved
in
this
suit.
this
--
this
particular
structure
with
which
we
are
here
concerned,
was
used
only
until
about
1954
and
has
never
been
used
since.
the
industry,
the
record
does
not
reflect
what
these
new
shapes
are,
but
this
patent
is
not
concerned
with
any
of
these
later
shapes
and
arrangements.
they
were
quite
different.
the
industry
having
seen
the
way
after
mackie-duluk
made
some
very
significant
developments
and
a
technological
advance
in
this
field,
with
which
this
patent
is
in
now
way
is
concerned.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
now,
go
into
this
question
of
what
is
infringement
and
what
is
not
and
what
the
courts
found
to
be
infringements.
i
believe
that
we
you
might
appreciate
on
the
basis
of
the
argument
as
i
have
thus
far
presented
it,
that
once
the
fabric
is
removed
from
the
car
completely,
we
have
substantially
conventional
components.
we
have,
as
i
pointed
out
to
the
court
before,
to
mr.
justice
harlan
i
believe
it
was
a
--
a
structure
of
such
conventional
nature
that
--
that
the
record
shows
that
one
of
the
standard
pre-mackie-duluk
top
as
the
trial
court
termed
it,
to
go
on
to
the
car
immediately
with
no
change
at
all.
if
--
if
the
court
is
interested
in
this
concept,
i
would
invite
attention
to
the
district
court's
finding.
this
appears
at
record
page
39
and
footnote
8
in
which
the
trial
court,
who
had
observed
these
structures
and
who
actually
observed
the
petitioner
harold
shapiro
install
one
of
this
snap
fastener
tops
on
the
car,
stated
that
it
is
interesting,
this
is
starting
in
about
the
third
line
of
footnote
8,
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
defendant's
own
efforts
which
shows
that
mackie-duluk
cars
could
have
applied
to
them
without
any
structural
change,
by
using
snap
button
receptacles
already
on
the
car
for
the
boot,
a
complete
standard
free
mackie-duluk
top
with
outside
the
two
nose
snaps.
in
other
words,
the
car
owner
and
defendants
and
instead,
did
not
have
to
subject
themselves
to
replacing
royalties
if
they
did
not
want
to
and
he
continues
in
that
claim.
the
car
itself
is
as
i
say,
completely
standard
and
once
this
new
shape
of
fabric
is
removed
for
whatever
reason
and
it
is
ordinarily
not
removed
because
it
is
more
novel,
with
this
position
we
take
direct
issue
with
mr.
spritzer's
allegations.
once
the
top
fabric
is
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
it
is
removed
ordinarily
because
it
doesn't
look
good.
let
me
--
let
me
--
this
--
this
is
quite
clear
in
the
--
in
the
court
--
in
both
courts'
findings.
the
reason
that
people
do
replacements,
if
they
do
them,
is
because
after
a
period
of
three
or
four
years,
the
tops
have
become
dirty
or
they
have
become
faded
somewhat.
they
don't
look
good.
it's
a
question
of
appearance.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
quite
true
mr.
justice
black,
that's
quite
true.
it's
quite
true,
but
there
are
repair
procedures
available
which
can
dress
up
these
tops
without
requiring
a
complete
top
replacement
and
these
are
far
simpler
procedures
which
are
shown
in
the
record
than
actual
top
replacement.
there
are
commercial
preparations
available
for
staining
these
tops
if
they
are
faded.
they
can
be
cleaned
if
necessary.
if
the
--
if
the
stitching
in
certain
portions
of
the
steam
has
--
of
the
top,
has
become
faded,
they
can
be
sold.
indeed,
even
if
there's
a
tear
in
the
part
of
the
top,
the
record
shows
that
a
panel
of
the
top
can
be
very
easily
be
replaced
without
any
difficulty
and
these
are
repair
procedures
with
which
we
have
no
difficulty
here.
patentee
is
not
trying
to
cover
these
at
all.
he
has
no
objection
to
such
repair
procedures,
not
only
which
are
well-known
in
the
industry
but
which
aro
themselves,
do
in
their
own
shops.
these
are
well-known
repair
procedures,
but
we
say
when
you
go
further
and
for
a
profit
motive
induce
someone
to
remove
his
entire
top
fabric
and
replace
it
with
a
very
new
fabric
of
this
special
shape,
then
you're
going
far
beyond
what
is
normally
considered
a
repair.
you
are,
if
you
will,
destroying
for
your
own
purposes,
the
heart
of
the
invention
which
is
still
perfectly
good
and
functionally
--
functionally
and
replacing
it
for
a
permissible
profit
motive,
if
you
will,
a
brand
new
structure
of
this
special
shape.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
then
it's
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
it
is
entirely
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
we
--
it
would
violate
the
patent,
if
you
put
on
a
brand
new
top
of
this
special
shape
but
you
need
not
do
that.
it
is
not
infringement
for
example,
if
you
took
off
your
old
top
and
put
on
one
of
these
non-infringing
fabrics
which
you
can
easily
do.
this
was
reflected
by
the
court
of
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
it's
its
shape
which
is
the
heart
of
this
thing.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
quite
true.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
it
wouldn't.
you'd
have
those
problems.
but
there's
nothing
startling
in
this
concept,
if
you
will.
perhaps,
if
i
may
just
elaborate
on
this
point
just
a
little
bit.
let
us
assume
that
--
well,
if
the
court
will
reflect,
it
will
see
that
there
are
many
parts
of
a
car
which
may
require
replacement
from
time
to
time
during
the
life
of
a
car.
for
example,
this
court
will
appreciate
that
if
you
buy
a
car
after
a
period
of
time,
you
may
wish
to
replace
the
tire
on
it
or
a
spark
plug
or
the
muffler
or
gaskets,
these
things
happen
time
and
time
again.
and
even
though
you
may
have
had
a
patent
structure
on
the
car
originally,
when
you
remove
that
structure
from
the
car,
you
no
longer
have
it.
and
if
you
replace
it
with
a
new
structure
of
that
type,
then
obviously
you
should
pay
royalty
and
there's
nothing
inequitable
about
this
particularly
where
you
have
a
choice.
let
us
assume
that
you
have
a
patented
type
spark
plug.
it
has
certain
advantages.
for
some
reason,
it
is
gone.
after
a
period
of
time,
you
want
a
new
spark
plug.
well,
you
have
a
choice
at
that
time.
do
i
want
a
patented
spark
plug
with
all
the
advantages
or
do
i
want
the
unpatented
spark
plug
with
--
without
some
of
these
advantages?
if
i
want
the
patented
spark
plug,
then
presumably
i'm
going
to
pay
the
royalty
which
accrues
to
the
patentees'
yankee
ingenuity
in
developing
these
advancements.
but
there's
nothing
startling
about
the
concept
of
having
a
choice
between
a
patented
and
unpatented
component
and
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
if
the
spark
plug
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
unpatented
parts
are
clearly
replaceable,
but
i
think
that
we
must
distinguish
between
an
unpatented
part
in
the
normal
context
and
a
part
which
is
unpatented
albeit
the
heart
of
the
patented
combination.
in
this
contributory
infringement
field
that
we're
talking
about,
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
a
technical
sense,
any
one
part
of
the
combination
is
unpatented,
if
you
will.
this
was
made
quite
clear
in
the
legislative
hearings
and
in
the
commentary
preceding
the
patent
act.
but
the
--
the
important
thing
is
that
there
maybe
some
technically
unpatented
parts
which
nevertheless,
mean
a
number
of
factual
tests
which
congress
had
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
these
unpatented
parts,
unpatented
in
the
sense
that
there
is
no
patent
covering
it
by
itself,
are
nevertheless,
the
heart
of
the
invention.
they
are
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
don't
see
how,
your
honor.
since
this
allegation
has
been
made,
i've
tried
to
drop
the
claim
on
shape
all
by
itself
and
i
just
can't
come
up
with
the
language.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
quite
so.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
quite
so.
this
is
precisely
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
i
--
i
may
anticipate
a
little
bit
but
just
to
later
on,
i
will
discuss
a
case
of
morrin
versus
robert
white
engineering,
a
case
decided
in
the
second
circuit,
in
which
the
invention
in
that
case,
was
a
new
shape
of
boiler
tube.
it's
akin
to
what
we
have
here
and
yet
in
that
case,
the
patentee
claimed
this
new
shape
of
boiler
tube
in
combination
with
certain
standard
boiler
parts
and
the
court
itself
recognized
that
this
was
done
in
order
to
describe
the
invention
intelligently.
and
this
was
the
reason
that
this
combination-formed
patent
was
required
by
the
patent
office
and
eventually
issued
in
that
from.
but
nevertheless,
they've
pointed
out
that
the
essence
of
the
invention
the
true
invented
concept
resided
not
in
the
standard
parts
because
there
was
nothing
new
there.
they
resided
in
this
new
shape
of
two.
perhaps,
if
i
get
into
this
question
of
repair
versus
reconstruction
which
is
very
essential
to
an
understanding
of
this
case,
we
can
appreciate
exactly
what
the
basis
of
the
court's
decisions
were
below.
the
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction
has
been
a
part
of
our
law
for
certainly
at
least
a
hundred
years.
it
was
discussed
in
this
court's
decision
in
wilson
versus
simpson
which
was
decided
in
1850.
and
this
court
has
discussed
it
in
cases
since
then,
cases
such
as
cotton-tie
versus
simmons,
cases
such
as
leeds
&
catlin
versus
victor
talking
machine,
cases
such
as
heyer
versus
the
duplicator
manufacturing
company,
just
to
name
a
few.
it's
a
doctrine
which
has
been
an
inherent
part
of
our
law
and
it
has
been
decided
or
it
has
been
involved
time
and
again
in
cases
of
all
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
it
did.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
it
did
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
--
i
can
give
a
very
--
if
you
--
if
you
would
refer
to
page
64
of
our
brief,
merely
by
example
that
occurs
to
me,
note,
footnote
10.
and
this
is
a
--
a
--
an
extract
from
a
material
which
was
presented
to
congress
by
the
association
of
american
railroads,
in
which
that
association
discussed
this
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction.
they
were
concerned
that
the
law
might
be
expanding
it.
they
appeared
to
have
no
objection
to
the
law
as
it
had
been
up
to
that
time.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
in
the
committee
reports,
it
appears
in
the
legislative
--
in
the
transcripts
of
the
legislative
hearings
and
as
--
this
particular
part
is
taken
from
an
appendix
to
one
of
here.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
footnote.
oh,
i'm
sorry
but
my
brief
is
the
blue
one.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
and
i
will
point
out
later
under
this
question
of
possible
liability
of
replacement
manufacturers
appeared
throughout
the
hearings
as
well.
in
the
same
section
of
my
brief,
i
have
made
reference
to
various
pages
of
the
hearing.
let
us
understand
what
this
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction
is
about.
many
years
ago,
dr.
oliver
wendell
holmes
wrote
a
poem
which
the
court
of
appeals
referred
to
and
i
--
and
i
refer
to
that
poem
with
no
intent
(inaudible)
because
it
--
it
thoroughly
illustrates
the
problem
that
we
have
here.
in
that
poem,
the
wonderful
one-hoss
shay,
dr.
holmes
discussed
the
deacon's
building
of
a
shay
which
had
no
weakest
part.
and
he
pointed
out
that
after
a
hundred
years
of
use
these
shays
went
to
pieces
all
at
once,
all
at
once
and
nothing
first,
just
as
bubbles
do
when
they
burst.
that's
a
quotation
from
the
poem.
well
in
our
common
knowledge,
in
our
common
everyday
experience,
things
just
don't
happen
this
way,
neither
a
shays
nor
anything
else
we
can
conceive
of,
other
than
a
bubble
goes
to
pieces
all
at
once.
in
any
arrangement
of
structure,
in
any
structure
which
has
more
than
one
part,
there's
always
some
weakest
part
and
there's
going
to
be
some
part
that
is
gone
in
advance
of
other
parts
for
one
reason
or
another.
now
the
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction
built
on
this
common
everyday
realization
that
after
a
period
of
time,
no
matter
what
combination
of
structure
might
be
sold,
patented
or
otherwise,
no
matter
what
combination
of
structure
maybe
sold
after
a
period
of
time,
some
parts
of
it
are
going
to
be
gone
for
one
reason
or
another.
and
it
may
occur
that
the
parts
which
are
gone
are
so
important
to
the
true
inventive
concept,
are
in
their
nature,
the
heart
of
the
invention
or
the
vital
component
that
the
entire
invention
can
be
said
to
be
destroyed
even
though
some
parts
of
the
structure
remained.
let
me
give
you
some
typical
decided
cases
on
this
point
here,
i
am
going
through
them
briefly
because
i
think
that
it
will
illustrate
the
problem.
one
of
the
classic
cases
in
this
field,
a
case
which
has
been
cited
time
and
again
in
many
decisions
is
the
first
circuit
case
of
davis
electrical
works
versus
the
edison
electric
light
company,
which
was
decided
in
the
first
circuit
in
1894.
in
that
particular
case,
mr.
thomas
edison,
who's
well
known
to
all
of
us,
invented
a
new
filament
for
a
light
bulb.
now,
a
new
filament
is
meaningless
in
the
abstract.
it
has
no
functional
utility.
it
just
can't
--
can't
even
be
described,
if
you
will,
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
the
patent
office
all
by
itself,
but
this
new
filament
was
of
a
use
in
conjunction
with
a
glass
--
glass
envelop
which
surrounded
it
and
with
a
socket
for
screwing
it
into
a
plug
of
sorts.
and
therefore,
in
his
claims,
mr.
edison
got
a
combination
claim,
if
you
will,
which
included
not
only
the
new
filament,
but
these
standard
background
elements
which
were
necessary
to
its
operation.
he
claimed
in
his
claims,
the
glass
envelope
and
the
socket
and
certain
electrical
connectors,
but
there
was
no
question
in
that
case
nor
is
there
any
in
this
case,
that
the
true
inventive
concept
was
only
in
one
part.
now
after
a
period
of
time,
mr.
edison's
bulb
burned
out,
such
things
do.
well,
the
only
thing
that
went
bad
was
the
filament,
the
new
part.
the
rest
of
the
envelope
and
the
sockets
and
everything
were
perfectly
good.
and
in
these
circumstances
we
found
that
the
defendant
would
gather
up
these
bulbs
and
he
would
replace
the
attenuated
carbon
filament
with
a
brand
new
filament
of
precisely
the
type
that
edison
had
developed.
he
did,
if
you
will,
replace
only
one
component
of
the
patented
combination
albeit
in
that
case
the
heart
of
an
invention,
the
true
inventive
concept.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit,
noting
that
the
true
test
was
entirely
factual;
noting
that
it
was
a
question
of
ultimate
fact
to
be
decided
by
juries
and
the
like.
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
first
circuit
held
that
even
though
only
one
part
of
the
combination
was
replaced,
nevertheless,
this
was
a
reconstruction
of
the
invention.
for
it
was
a
re-providing
of
the
heart
and
essence
of
the
invention.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
are
you
referring
to
the
photographs
in
this
large
volume?
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
there
are
--
there
are
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
if
they
appear
on
the
large
volume,
unfortunately,
none
of
them
referred
to
it.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
none
of
them
showed
the
fabric
by
itself.
well
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
the
fabric
--
the
actual
material
can
be
of
various
types.
we're
not
primarily
concerned
with
material
here.
theoretically,
it
could
be
an
impregnated
canvass
of
sorts
or
the
latest
developments
and
by
far
a
superior
development
as
reflected
in
the
record,
is
certain
vinyl
plastic
materials
which
have
their
seams
electronically
sealed
to
one
another.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
no.
we
don't
care
whether
the
fabric
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
we
claim
that
they
removed
the
fabric
completely
from
the
old
car
when
it
need
not
be
removed,
when
it
can
be
repaired
by
other
techniques.
we
--
we
claim
that
they
remove
it
at
a
time
when
it
is
still
perfectly
good
functionally.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
well,
we
don't
object
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
he
can
change
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
oh
yes,
he
can
change.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
this
is
the
-
this
is
the
--
the
essence
of
this
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction,
which
i
have
been
discussing
namely
that
under
some
circumstances,
the
part
which
is
replaced
maybe
of
such
vital
significance
to
the
invention
that
it
cannot
be
permissibly
replaced.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
--
i
would
imagine
that
there
are
design
patents
and
suppose
or
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
would
expect
that
if
we
--
well
we
have,
let
us
say,
a
new
zipper
on
the
clothes,
a
new
type
of
zipper,
i
would
expect
that
even
if
that
new
zipper
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
they
--
there
are
certainly
well
--
if
they
had
certainly
perfectly
able
to
do
that
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
they
could
buy
it
from
any
licensed
source,
i
should
think.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
any
licensed
source.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
they
could.
let
--
let's
take
this
case
of
a
convertible
top.
if
a
man
doesn't
like
his
original
top
and
removes
it,
and
he
is
perfectly
able
to
replace
with
another
color
if
you
will
or
with
another
fabric
material
if
you
will,
which
has
a
non-patented
shape.
we
have
no
objection
to
that.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
not
by
itself,
not
by
itself.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
not
because
of
anything
that
is
non-patentable
in
shape,
but
merely
because
of
semantic
difficulties
in
trying
to
describe
it
and
difficulties
which
are
engendered
by
the
patent
office
rules
which
therefore
require
that
in
order
to
completely
describe
what
you're
talking
about,
you
have
to
import
these
other
background
elements.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
think
that
that
may
often
occur.
i
would
have
difficulty
for
example,
in
describing
the
color
red,
but
if
i
were
able
to
bring
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
true.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
there
is.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
well,
that's
--
that's
certainly
a
good
picture
of
it.
if
--
if
your
honor
will
refer
to
figure
1
of
the
patent
which
is
at
589.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
the
fabric
material
is
shown
from
looking
--
looking
from
the
inside
of
the
car
toward
the
fabric,
this
shape
here
--
you
--
you
see
the
numeral
28?
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
in
--
in
figure
1,
the
numeral
28
below
the
--
immediately
above
the
bottom
line
of
the
figure
that
is
a
numeral
28,
with
the
lead
line
there.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
there
--
there
is
a
--
that
is
a
reference
to
a
--
this
entire
loose
section
of
fabric
which
came
down
inside
of
the
car
deep
enough
to
be
permanently
fastened.
and
in
side
section,
this
appears
in
figure
2
on
which
we
again
have
the
numerals
28
and
38,
showing
this
prolongation
of
fabric
coming
down
into
the
car.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
various
parts
of
dresses;
i
would
imagine
if
someone
--
well,
the
typical
thing
that
occurs
to
me
is
of
course
various
ladies'
undergarments
are
constantly
being
patented.
all
sorts
of
changes
are
made
on
those.
dress
patents
or
dress
patterns,
if
you
will,
are
commonly
protected
under
the
design
patent
law.
they
are
more
ornamental
than
--
well,
they
certainly
have
the
utilitarian
function
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
they're
not
functional,
but
commonly,
the
malady
of
the
dress
pattern
is
in
it's
ornamentation
and
in
the
--
in
its
new
and
ornamental
aspect
and
these
are
protected
under
a
different
section
of
the
patent
laws,
namely
design
patents.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
because
one
of
the
features
of
the
design
law
is
that
there
must
be
a
distinction
between
ornamentation
or
something
which
is
ornamental
and
something
which
is
functional.
in
this
particular
case,
the
important
part
of
the
fabric
actually
comes
down
into
the
--
inside
of
the
car
and
does
not
lend
itself
to
the
ornamentation
of
the
top.
it
would
not
ordinarily
be
seen
by
anyone
viewing
the
car.
and
therefore,
under
these
circumstances,
no
design
protection
would
be
available.
it
would
be
hidden
from
view,
in
normal
view,
sir.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
we
don't
--
we
don't,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
perhaps,
i
misunderstand
your
question
correct
me
please
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
you're
talking
about
the
shingle,
perhaps.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
well,
ornamentation
is
not
our
prime
purpose
here.
it
was
a
solution
of
this
functional
difficulty
which
i've
described.
i
don't
know
the
topic
you
have,
i'm
sure
it's
quite
attractive
but
it
--
nothing
with
this
topic
is
concerned
with.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
you
say
it's
a
1949
oldsmobile?
well,
if
it's
not
even
involved
in
this
patent
because
the
structure
is
identical
â€“
[luaghter]
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
this
is
repair.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
this
is
the
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
well,
as
you
have
stated,
it
could
be
repaired,
if
you
will.
it
could
be
made
functional
again
by
other
techniques
than
complete
replacement.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
thought
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
think
that
if
you
went
down
to
the
western
auto
store,
you
would
find
that
there
are
patch
kits
available.
the
pep
boys
have
them
for
98
cents.
i
think
that
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
you
can
do
them
yourself.
these
are
readily
available
in
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
--
i
don't
know
where
they
would
be
available,
i've
never
considered
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
just
the
pattern?
oh
no
--
no,
don't
just
the
pattern.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
i
mean,
you
could
copy
it
very
easily
from
the
pattern,
you
know.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
yes,
we
do.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
we
do.
i
think
that
as
i
developed
this
doctrine
repair
versus
reconstruction,
you
will
see
mr.
chief
justice
that
one
of
the
considerations
which
courts
have
given,
one
of
the
factors
which
they
considered,
is
that
where
a
part
is
replaced
which
is
not
truly
worn
out
and
then
replacement
is
done
for
some
reason
other
than
legitimate
repair.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
this
is
just
one
factor.
there
are
a
number
of
factual
criteria
which
have
been
developed
in
case
after
case.
and
none
of
these
criteria
is
controlling
by
itself,
but
this
is
just
one
and
i
--
and
i
will
be
getting
immediately
to
all
of
these
criteria
which
the
courts
do
consider.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
they
do
not.
this
is
a
question
of
common
sense
the
courts
have
said.
this
court,
itself,
in
heyer
versus
duplicator,
said
that
the
real
test
is
common
sense
applied
to
the
specific
facts.
all
of
these
cases
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
to
the
--
i
would
--
would
you
like
me
to
get
into
some
of
these
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i'm
sorry,
mr.
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
to
what
criteria?
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
the
--
the
--
this
court
in
heyer
said,
common
sense
applied
to
the
specific
facts
of
each
case.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
now
these
facts
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
quite
true.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
quite
true,
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
patentee
has
read
hair.
this
is
completely
beside
the
point.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes
sir,
that's
quite
true.
and
you
can
buy
a
new
top
with
a
different
shade.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
absolutely
--
absolutely.
we
have
no
objection
to
any
of
that.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
as
i
say,
there
had
been
a
number
of
cases
in
this
repair
versus
reconstruction
field
which
have
laid
down
among
others
--
i
will
--
i
will
not
go
through
some
of
these
criteria.
actually,
before
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
partners
to
this
case
argued
some
15
criteria,
some
15
factual
circumstances
which
were
developed
in
the
record
but
here
are
some
of
the
typical
kinds.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that
is
true,
sir.
and
that
the
courts
have
consistently
said
that
this
is
a
factual
issue,
it's
a
question
of
founded
fact
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
certain
subsidiary
facts
and
they
have
gone
further
and
lay
down
in
case
after
case,
some
of
the
subsidiary
facts,
which
they
think
are
important.
they
say
for
example
that
if
we
can
examine
the
structure
and
determine
that
it
does
have
a
heart,
a
heart
of
the
patented
invention
and
not
all
combinations
do,
but
if
there
is
some
significant
new
part
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
the
filament
of
the
edison
bulb,
then
replacement
of
such
a
heart
of
the
invention
tends
to
indicate
reconstruction
rather
than
--
rather
than
repair,
this
is
just
one
criterion.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
certainly,
it
was
in
existence
in
1850
when
this
court
spoke
of
it
in
wilson
versus
simpson.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
quite
so.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
yes.
the
very
question
there
was
whether
or
not,
by
replacing
certain
cutter
knives,
there
was
a
repair
or
a
reconstruction
of
a
planing
machine.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
in
a
--
in
the
--
in
the
next
case
that
i've
been
able
to
find
is
cotton-tie
versus
simmons
which
is
reported
at
106
u.s.
89.
the
court
spoke
of
the
--
of
this
same
doctrine
in
leeds
&
catlin
versus
victor
talking
machine
which
is
reported
at
213
u.s.
325.
this
court
also
referred
to
the
doctrine
in
heyer
versus
duplicator,
mr.
holmes'
decision
and
that
appears
in
263
u.s.
100.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
it's
the
latest
case
i
have
reference
to
here.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
263,
100.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
none
that
i've
been
able
to
find.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
yes.
it
--
it
was
certainly
a
part
and
an
important
part
of
this
case
law
and
i
might
invite
attention
just
to
digress
for
a
moment
to
the
government's
brief.
this
is
the
little
gray
brief
which
they
have
filed.
at
particularly
page
8
of
that
brief,
in
which
the
government
states
that
section
271
(c)
and
this
is
the
contributory
infringement
section
of
the
statute,
that
this
section
defines
contributory
infringement
in
terms
of
direct
infringement.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
in
terms
of
direct
infringement
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
that
this
definition
of
direct
infringement
as
it
appears
in
section
271
(a)
is
declaratory
and
i
quote,
"left
intact
the
entire
body
of
case
law
on
direct
infringement."
and
we
must
understand
that
this
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction
is
a
direct
infringement
question.
i
believe
--
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that
is
true.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
we
have
direct
infringement
when
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
when
some
caught
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
sir.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
we
--
we
have
both,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes.
when
these
people
in
their
own
trim
shop,
the
--
they
maintain
a
facility
for
installing
tops.
when
they
actually
put
these
tops
on
cars
themselves,
they
are
direct
infringers.
however,
they
also
supply
them
to
other
trimmers
to
do
that
job
and
when
these
other
people
do
it,
they're
the
direct
infringers
when
these
people
have
are
the
contributory
infringers.
there
are
both
aspects
in
the
case.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
except
that
the
contributory
infringer
requires
a
sale
of
the
part
and
that's
the
case.
i
--
i
would
like
to
continue
with
some
of
these
cases
under
repair
versus
reconstruction.
i
have
discussed
this
thomas
edison
case,
there's
also
the
case
of
morrin
versus
robert
white
engineering,
which
was
decided
at
the
second
circuit
in
which,
this
is
the
case
i
mentioned
before,
in
which
we
had
certain
specially
shaped
boiler
tubes
which
were
--
described
in
conjunction
with
the
rest
of
the
boiler
to
describe
these
tubes
intelligently
and
in
that
case,
the
only
part
that
was
replaced
again
were
these
specially
shaded
tubes.
and
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
this
replacement
of
the
tubes,
just
part
of
the
combination
was
in
fact
a
furnishing
of
a
new
boiler
essentially
reconstructed
in
all
of
its
novel
features
and
this
they
said
was
reconstruction
and
infringement.
in
the
case
of
automotive
parts
versus
wisconsin
axle,
which
is
a
sixth
circuit
case,
we
again
had
an
automotive
part
case
and
the
general
electric
versus
preferred
case
has
been
cited
by
mr.
spritzer,
but
this
is
not
--
i
don't
believe
that
this
shows
that
just
because
we
have
an
automobile
part,
that
necessarily
means
that
in
any
part
is
replaceable.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
sir.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
it
would
not
be.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
quite
true.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes
and
the
contributory
infringement
derives
from
the
intent
with
which
the
article
is
originally
sold.
in
this
case
for
example,
if
you
will
examine
petitioner's
question
one,
you
will
find
that
he
concedes
in
this
question
that
the
parts
here
involved
were
especially
cut
and
intended
for
use
in
the
patented
combination.
this
is
an
essential
question
of
fact.
this
intent
must
be
determined
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case
and
it
is
an
intent
which
is
definitely
spelled
out
on
the
statute.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes
and
if
these
people
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
then
there
has
been
no
direct
infringement
and
therefore,
no
contributory
infringement.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
quite
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
right
and
if
these
people
can
show
that
you
never
installed
that
top
that
would
be
a
perfect
defense.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
well,
i
didn't
say
that.
the
court
said
it,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
--
the
court
in
that
first
circuit
case,
stated
--
if
--
if
you
will
look
at
our
brief
from
page
51,
we
have
quoted
from
a
tenth
circuit
case,
williams
versus
hughes
tool
company,
which
was
decided
shortly
before
this
reenactment
by
congress.
and
in
that
particular
case,
the
court
quoted
at
length
from
various
other
cases
and
you'll
find
at
the
top
of
51,
the
top
of
our
brief,
51,
they
spoke
of
this
davis'
case.
they
said
that
the
court
held
that
the
replacement
of
an
attenuated
carbon
filament
one
element
in
the
combination
was
reconstruction
and
not
permissible
repair
because
all
of
the
elements
other
than
the
filament
were
old
and
the
filament
had
its
use
and
the
relation
described
was
the
new
element
in
the
combination
and
produced
the
improved
results.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
oh,
yes.
this
was
not
the
basic
electric
lamp
invention.
this
was
merely
a
new
filament.
the
lamps
were
known
before
that,
just
as
convertible
cars
were
known
before
our
invention.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
but
not
with
a
--
an
automatic
seal
in
the
rear
quarter.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i'm
talking
about
the
--
the
top
that
--
well,
in
1949,
i
have
assume
you
have
a
power
to
assist
mr.
justice,
so
that
you
can
press
a
button
and
your
top
comes
up.
but
then,
i
would
assume
that
you
have
to
get
out
of
your
car
and
do
something
in
the
rear
quarter.
well,
i
don't
know
what
structure
you
have.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
are
you
sure
you
drive
a
1949?
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
put
a
little
laver?
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
it
sounds
like
a
wonderful
idea.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
--
i
--
i
had
the
impression
that
in
1949,
the
general
motors
cars
had
sort
of
a
cup
and
channel
arrangement
in
the
rear
quarter
that
you
got
out
back
of
your
rear
windows
and
actually
snapped
the
flap
material
around
the
cup.
well
this
was
my
impression.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
just
on
--
on
a
special
--
well,
on
this
top
which
permits
this
automatic
sealing
on
the
rear
quarter,
i
frankly
don't
know
what
your
structure
is.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
oh,
no.
this
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
motor
which
raises
it
or
lowers
or
anything
like
that.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
no,
it
does
not.
no,
that
--
that
in
itself
is
old.
we're
not
trying
to
cover
anything
like
that.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
right,
the
rear
quarter
section.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
you
don't
have
to
do
that
anymore.
now
actually
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
right.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that
is
the
heart
of
the
invention
and
it's
--
it's
a
little
bit
more
complex
that
you
might
imagine
simply
because,
let
us
picture
when
you
snap
this
top
and
--
snap
these
buttons
on,
when
you
lower
your
top
they
will
rip
loose.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
so
that.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
exactly,
that's
my
(inaudible)
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
quite
so,
exactly.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that
for
the
first
time,
we
have
--
first
time
we
have
what
is
in
the
title
namely
a
folding
top
with
an
automatic
seal
in
the
rear
quarter
rather
these
manual
seals.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
get
out
of
your
car
and
do
anything
of
that
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
absolutely.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that
is
the
thing.
yes,
that
is.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
only
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
say
that
the
time
is
shortly
up.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
say
that
yes.
i
say,
yes,
it's
quite
so.
i
say
that
the
validity
of
the
patent
was
challenged
before
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
found
the
patent
valid,
found
it
to
be
and
i
quote,
"a
substantial
and
enlightened
step"
and
no
validity
question
was
ever
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
(voice
overlap)
and
it's
not
presented
here.
that's
right.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no,
no.
validity
is
not
an
issue
here.
just
to
continue,
there
were
a
great
number
of
factors
unfortunately
a
--
a
great
number
of
criteria
which
had
been
developed
in
the
case
law
to
determine
whether
something
is
a
repair
or
reconstruction.
we
have
mentioned
these
at
some
length
in
our
brief
and
the
interesting
thing
is
that
under
the
specific
facts
of
this
case,
all
of
these
criteria
are
met
by
defendant's
particular
operations.
we
have
in
this
case
ample
support
for
the
ultimate
findings
of
fact
below
that
defendant
reconstructed
rather
than
merely
repaired.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
into
the
government's
argument
in
the
very
few
minutes
that
i
have
remaining
here.
the
government
states,
as
i
understand
their
position,
that
any
worn
out
part
should
be
replaceable.
i
don't
believe
that
that
applies
to
the
facts
in
this
case
simply
because
the
parts
here
when
replaced,
are
not
worn
out.
and
this
is
a
--
a
criterion
in
which
they
assumed
in
their
test
which
is
not
here
present.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no
well,
the
--
the
district
court
pointed
out
that
the
conditions
of
replacement
are
ordinarily,
situations
in
which
we
have
superficial
wear.
this
was
an
expressed
finding.
and
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
replacement
is
made
for
conditions
of
appearance
where
questions
of
appearance
but
that,
if
a
person
is
not
too
fastidious
as
to
appearance,
he
doesn't
have
to
replace
his
top
even
then.
so
that
the
top
is
not
worn
out
insofar
as
a
person
is
not
too
fastidious
as
to
appearance
is
concerned.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
exactly.
before
this
court,
the
justice
department
argues
what
we
believed
to
be
arguments
essentially
similar
to
those
presented
to
congress.
now,
we
do
feel
that
congress
reenacted
the
law
in
1952,
this
law
of
repair
versus
reconstruction.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no.
i
--
well
what
i
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
perhaps,
i
can
verify
that
(voice
overlap).
i
would
understand
that
the
government's
argument
as
such
that
they
say
that
under
section
271
(c),
a
replacement
part
manufacturer
should
not
be
liable
under
any
circumstances,
if
he
is
just
selling
a
replacement
part.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
this
in
effect,
would
be
the
result
of
the
argument
presented
here.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
believe
that
it
was
and
i
believe
that
you
pointed
out
my
brief.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
question
with
that
the
court
below
applied
the
correct
criteria
and
applied
them
correctly.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
believe
that's
quite
correct.
yes.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
true.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
true.
and
if
i
may
elaborate
just
for
a
moment,
you
will
find
that
in
leeds
&
catlin
for
example,
in
leeds
&
catlin
for
example
and
in
cotton-tie
versus
simmons,
this
court
in
both
cases,
found
reconstruction
through
--
through
replacement
of
only
one
part
of
the
combination.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
there
is
--
yes
there
is
--
if
i
may
answer
that
question.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
first
of
all
mr
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
just
because
as
part
as
made
of
fabric,
it
necessarily
has
a
very
short
life,
if
you
will
consider
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
alright,
this
court
--
this
court
in
wilson
v.
simpson,
said
first
of
all,
that
perishability
is
not
a
test
to
be
applied
in
repair
versus
reconstruction.
this
basic
case
in
wilson
v.
simpson
said
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
said
i
have
a
(inaudible)
edition
copy
here,
said
that
"the
right
of
the
assignee
to
replace
the
cutter
knife
is
not
because
they
are
perishable
materials,
but
because
of
certain
considerations
of
intent."
in
that
case
therefore,
they
said
that
perishability,
the
mere
fact
that
something
wears
out
in
advance
on
another
part
is
not
the
important
thing
and
this
court
in
leeds
&
catlin
said
substantially
the
same
thing
and
i
--
in
--
in
that
case
they
said
that,
"no
licence
should
be
implied
merely
because
of
a
difference
and
duration
of
various
parts
of
the
combination."
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
in
that
particular
case?
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
under
the
fact
and
circumstances
of
that
case,
they
construed
the
intent
of
the
vendor
as
being
one
in
which
replacement
was
permitted.
in
leeds
&
catlin,
they
said,
the
replacement
of
that
part
in
that
case
would
be
reconstruction
and
not
permitted
and
the
--
the
cases
are
dependent
solely
under
different
facts.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
yes,
i
have
here
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
i
have
here
the
case
of
wilson
v
simpson.
some
of
the
characteristics
which
this
court
--
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
considered
was
first
of
all.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
that's
right,
that's
right.
now,
here
are
some
of
the
factors
which
appear
on
the
decision.
they
said
first
of
all
that
the
part
that
that
very
short
life,
60
to
90
days
and
that
the
machine
itself
had
a
life
of
years.
in
this
particular
case
of
course,
the
fabric
itself
lasts
for
years.
in
that
particular
case,
another
factor
which
they
considered
was
that
the
parts
were
so
arranged
that
only
one
particular
type
of
part
could
be
replaced
thereon.
and
they
said
that,
obviously,
if
the
parts
remaining
when
this
part
is
gone
are
so
arranged
that
you
could
only
put
one
part
on,
then
the
patentee
must've
intended
that
that's
part
you
put
back.
of
course
those
circumstances
are
present
here.
the
parts
are
so
arranged
that
you
can
put
many
different
things
on
them.
that
this
court
went
in
to
point
out
that
in
--
in
question
--
in
--
in
resolving
this
question
of
intent,
that
they
said
that
there
are
other
parts
of
the
combination,
which
may
be
put
into
the
combination
with
no
intent
that
they'd
be
replaced
and
that
in
those
parts,
replacement
is
not
permitted.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
no.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
the
parts.
mr.
elliot
i.
pollock
quite,
that's
so,
yes.
thank
you.
