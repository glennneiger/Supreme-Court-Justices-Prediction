the
patent
division
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry
but
direct
my
mind.
am
i
--
am
i
to
infer
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
was
the
ruling
of
this
court
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
want
to
rely
on
the
statute
for
your
--
for
your
position
or
the
statute
is
declaratory
or
--
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
after
that,
the
statute
is
declaratory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
declaratory,
namely
that
he
couldn't
be
a
contributory
infringer
or
so-called
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
without
disturbing
the
architecture
of
your
argument
is
it
stated
the
outset
what
legal
proposition
you
are
tending
to
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
view
--
but
your
view
is
that
the
act
of
1952
did
not
make
a
change
in
the
law,
but
merely
is
declaratory
of
the
old
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
anticipating
believe
the
direction
of
your
argument
that
because
of
the
nature
of
the
fabric
shape,
it
is
an
ingredient
part
of
the
total
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
in
effect
that
the
--
what
is
meant
by
combination
in
this
particular
patent,
is
the
relationship
of
the
part
that
can't
be
broken
into
separate
units?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
the
copy
is
significant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
argument
as
this
shape
apply
to
all
the
other
constituent
parts
of
the
whole?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
nature
of
the
fabric
or
its
shape?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet,
you
told
us
mr.
pollack,
from
my
understanding
that
if
the
shape
is
crucial
to
avoid
the
problems
of
preexistence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
some
other
shape
would
do
this
thing
about
the
same
result
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
shape
couldn't
be
patented?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
this
is
crucial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
bringing
to
cars
that
for
which
the
patent
is
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
it
then
that
--
that
although
in
of
itself
has
no
function
in
relationships,
it's
the
effective
functioning
aspect
of
the
patent.
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
doctrine
appear
in
the
discussions
before
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
enactment
of
the
1952
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
give
preferences
to
those
discussions
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
referred
to
committee
report,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
and
copy
it
from
the
patent
office
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
must
all
be
satisfied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
common
sense
with
reference
to
what
other
criteria
on
or
criteria.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
are
the
alternates,
what
is
--
you
can't
--
you
got
--
you
say
common
sense
with
the
reference
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
by
this
case
and
i
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
with
reference
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
the
common
sense
of
the
judgement
must
be
exercised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
be
judged
by
some
standard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can't
be
judged
by
themselves?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
filament
and
the
edison
bulb.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
this
document
originate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
in
that
case,
acknowledged
the
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
terms,
in
terms
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
many
cases
since
the
wilson
case
has
this
court
reaffirmed
or
acknowledged
or
assumed
the
existence
by
deciding
cases
on
its
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
latest
case
in
which
reference
is
made
to
the
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
263
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
100,
that's
what
--
that
about
1923?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
from
1923
down
to
date,
your
opinion
in
this
court
has
--
had
occasion
or
did
in
fact
because
of
the
(inaudible)
is
that
right
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
when
congress
came
to
codify
the
patent
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
19
--
which
eventuated
in
the
act
of
1952
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
codification
was
a
clarification
of
the
doctrine
that
you
say
--
is
illustrated
by
those
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
terms
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can't
have
contributory
infringement
unless
you
have
direct
infringement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
in
this
case,
you
haven't
got
contributory
infringement
at
all,
you
have
merely
direct
infringement
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
did
--
as
--
as
i
get
your
argument,
you
have
merely
directed
infringement
not
contributory
reasons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
explain
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
actual
--
what
is
physically
done
in
violation
of
your
claimed
patent
right
is
the
same
whether
direct
infringers
or
the
contributory
infringer
does
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
about
edison's
filament?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
somebody
manufactures
edison's
filaments
and
sells
those
filaments
of
children's
play
thing
or
for
constructing
nice
japanese
(inaudible),
would
that
be
an
infringement
of
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
if
the
infringement
in
that
case
is
valid,
derived
from
the
use
made
in
producing
the
result
which
is
a
functional
entity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
patent
--
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
i'm
a
collector
of
shapes
and
just
--
and
buy
these
things
from
the
present
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
just
buy
them
in
shapes
in
--
in
a
warehouse
where
i
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
make
no
use
of
them
at
all,
you
just
buy
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
somebody
not
the
patentee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
have
your
patent.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
want
to
produce
it,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
this
patent
ever
been
challenged
in
any
--
any
--
in
any
litigation,
in
any
adjudicated
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
you
answered
justice
harlan
the
validity
of
the
patent
is
not
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
applies
to
me
what
you've
just
said
essentially
with
the
government
hearing
these
arguments
before
the
congress.
that
implies
to
me
that
that
was
actually
prevented
to
congress
issued
as
the
validity
of
the
difference
between
repair
and
reconstruction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
means
that
--
that
they
rule
out
the
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
you
say
therefore,
when
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
the
government
in
effect,
is
making
the
argument
here
which
didn't
prevail
before
congress
in
process
of
enactment,
i
will
take
my
suggestion
that
that
must
imply,
that
the
doctrine
of
replacement
versus
repair
was
before
congress
in
such
an
effective
and
significant
way
that
the
act
must
be
construed
to
be
declaratory
of
the
doctrine
theretofore
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
your
thing
even
for
at
least
you
give
him
four
cases,
that
the
--
if
i
look
at
these
three
cases,
106,
213,
263
and
(inaudible),
i
will
find
that
the
matter
of
fair
reading
of
english
that
this
court
acted
on
and
enunciated
the
doctrine
of
repair
versus
reconstruction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
comes
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
adding
to
what
the
explanation
you
have
just
made,
by
giving
the
details
from
which
the
court
derived
intent
with
the
(inaudible)
that
the
user
may
rephrase
the
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
seems
to
me
to
be
asking
anything
of
the
courts
to
make
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
bearing
in
such
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
intent
of
the
patentee
was
that
i
could
be
replace
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
--
so
that's
what
you
call
intent
or
what
they
call
intent,
case
to
be
derived
not
of
an
extraction
to
the
mental
state
of
somebody
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
from
the
structural
and
functional
arrangement
of
--
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
the
combination.
