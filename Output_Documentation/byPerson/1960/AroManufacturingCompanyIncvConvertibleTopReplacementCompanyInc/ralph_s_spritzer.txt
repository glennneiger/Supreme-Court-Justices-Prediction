mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
charge
of
infringement
which
was
actually
made
by
the
respondent
here
was
limited
to
the
charge
that
the
aro
company
had
infringed
by
replacing
the
worn-out
convertible
top
fabric
when
--
when
it
wore
out.
there
was
no
charge
of
infringement
in
the
sense
that
aro's,
having
supplied
a
manufacturer
with
material
which
he
in
turn
might
use
to
install
the
original
top.
so
that
we
don't
have
here,
so
far
as
the
charge
of
infringement
is
concerned,
a
question
of
the
supply
for
purposes
--
supply
of
an
element
for
purposes
of
creating
the
entire
patented
entity.
the
charge
is
simply
that
there
was
an
infringement
when
these
fabrics
were
supplied
to
infringe
afterward
to
do-it-yourself
car
owners
to
replace
the
original
fabric.
and
that
being
so,
i
can
assume
i
think
of
--
for
the
purpose
of
the
central
issue
in
this
case,
the
charge
of
infringement
made.
i
can
assume
that
if
aro
had
supplied
these
convertible
top
fabrics
designed
as
they
were
to
an
automobile
manufacturer
who
had
no
license
from
the
patentee
and
if
that
automobile
manufacturer
had
taken
the
fabric
and
then,
together
with
all
the
other
elements
which
made
up
the
combination,
created
the
patented
articles
that
that
would
constitute
a
direct
infringement.
we
can
assume
further
for
purposes
of
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
on
the
part
of
the
automobile
maker.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
presume
further
that
aro
in
that
event
might
have
been
liable
as
a
contributory
infringer
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
for
supplying
the
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
when
i
speak
of
the
top
fabric,
i
mean
in
the
form
and
design.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
shape
and
design
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
--
the
--
the
patent
with
which
we
deal
in
this
case
is
a
combination
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
patent
which
has
a
number
of
elements
of
which
the
fabric
in
its
particular
shape
and
design
is
but
one
element.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
not
patented,
never
thought
it
may.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
say
that
i'm
--
petitioners
argued
that
even
in
that
event,
there
will
be
no
contributory
infringement
on
his
part
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
because
he
believes
all
of
the
conditions
of
section
271
would
still
not
be
satisfied.
i
say
i
don't
--
i
think
we
can
put
that
to
one
side
because
no
charge
of
infringement
here
is
based
upon
supply
to
an
automobile
manufacturer.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i'm
going
to
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
(voice
overlap)
myself
to
the
narrower
question
which
is
the
only
question
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
spoke
at
this
time
at
least.
and
that
part
is
the
only
point
i've
been
tending
to
make
that
far
is
that
we
don't
deal
with
alleged
infringement
by
automobile
manufacturers
about
their
suppliers.
and
thus,
i
think
the
primary
focus
of
inquiry
becomes
this
whether
an
individual,
an
ordinary
consumer
who
has
bought
a
convertible
automobile
from
one
who
was
authorized
to
make
it
in
the
way
that
he
did,
whether
that
consumer
--
when
the
fabric
wears
out,
two
or
three
years
later,
exceeds
his
rights,
if
he
goes
ahead
and
replaced
it
with
either
himself
or
with
someone
else's
aid
with
another
new
fabric
of
similar
design.
now,
i
think
everybody
in
this
case
concedes
that
if
there
is
no
direct
infringement,
if
it's
not
an
infringement
by
the
automobile
owner
to
replace
the
fabric
that
then
there
is
no
issue
in
contributory
infringement
because
without
the
direct
infringement,
no
one
can
be
contributing
to
an
infringement.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
so,
yes.
i
(inaudible)
briefs.
another
way
of
stating,
we
think,
is
the
central
issue
or
at
least
the
issues
which
government
has
assigned
itself
is
that
we
have
here,
another
way
of
stating
it
is
we
have
here
a
question
as
to
the
scope
of
the
owner's
right
to
use
the
article
which
is
involved.
and
that
the
burden
of
our
contention
is
that
a
man
who
buys
an
automobile
has
an
implied
license
to
use
it
freely
to
hold
on
that.
that
he's
entitled
to
use
it
for
as
long
as
yankee
ingenuity
could
keep
it
going.
and
that
to
this
end,
he
can
replace
individual
component
parts
of
a
patented
combination
as
they
wear
out
or
becoming
exhausted
in
ordinary
course
in
advance
of
the
enlightenment
of
car
is
uphold
that
he
can
do
this
without
any
further
license
or
authorization
from
anyone,
so
long
as
the
individual
part
in
question
is
not
itself
patent.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
he
can
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
i
think
he
can
do
it
as
the
matter
of
case,
yes,
because
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
this
is
an
unpatented
element
and
i
don't
think
the
replacement
of
this
single
element
constitutes
a
recreation
of
the
patented
combination.
of
course,
the
findings
in
this
case
are
that
people
normally
replace
these
tops
when
they
become
either
highly
unattractive
or
seriously
worn
out
in
two
or
three
years
on
the
average
(inaudible)
of
the
car.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right
in
the
case
where
there
is
something
which
fall
short,
as
i
think
it's
clearly
the
situation
here
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
of
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
of
a
recreation
under
the
combination.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
right.
that's
right.
i
should
pause
to
emphasize
what
i
think
the
government's
interest
and
--
and
concern
in
this
litigation
which
has
brought
up
in
this
case.
we
think
that
if
one
were
to
adopt
the
tops,
the
court
below
i
think
is
gone,
whereby
if
you
suffice
for
the
patentee
to
show
that
the
parts
being
replaced,
part
of
the
combination
being
replaced
by
the
purchaser
of
the
machine
is
a
significant
part
or
an
integral
part
or
a
major
part
or
an
extensive
part,
if
it
were
to
--
if
that
would
suffice
so
as
to
enable
him
to
monopolize
the
replacement
of
this
element,
we
think
then
a
patentee
would
be
encouraged
and
would
be
permitting
to
assert
monopolistic
powers
over
the
replacement
parts
market,
even
though
the
part
is
in
question
by
themselves
unpatented.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
as
we
understand
the
distinction
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
we
think
the
distinction
is
between
permissible
repair
or
replacement
of
a
--
of
component
parts
on
the
one
hand
and
forbidden
reconstruction
of
the
entire
combination
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
if
--
if
the
replacement
is
of
a
single
element,
then
i
think
it
can
be
done
in
all
circumstances.
but
i
think
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
--
i
think
it
was
the
replacement
and
repair
concept
which
permitted
owner
to
replace
for
reasons
of
personal
preferences
as
well
as
the
purposes
of
utility.
and
i
think
the
--
the
real
problem
that
we
--
that
we
have
is,
what
is
the
difference?
what
is
the
line
as
between
permissible
repair
or
permissible
replacement
of
components
and
through
reconstruction
or
complete
reconstruction
or
substantial
reconstruction
of
the
patented
combination?
and
that
--
that
i've
really
like
to
come
to
next
but
i
should,
perhaps,
emphasize
though,
i
think
petitioners'
counsel
has
already
alluded
to
it.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
here,
we
don't
have
a
patent
on
the
fabric
or
indeed
on
one
element,
we
have
a
patent
covering
a
combination
of
a
number
of
elements.
and
the
findings
on
that
were
at
page
36
of
the
record
and
at
that
point,
judge
aldrich
was
pointing
out,
i'm
looking
about
half
way
down
the
page,
he
was
pointing
out
what
the
investors
--
36,
yes,
sir.
he
was
pointing
out
what
he
thought
the
inventors
of
this
particular
convertible
top
had
accomplished
and
he
said,
"rather
than
affixing
the
fabric,
the
tonneau
itself
they
attached
it
to
a
trough
or
gutter
and
then
he
goes
on
to
describe
how
water
would
be
directed
into
a
trough
and
carried
out
by
a
drain,
how
a
wiping
arm
would
be
utilized
in
order
to
affect
the
seal
and
i
shouldn't
go
into
the
details,
but
i
do
want
to
make
the
point
that
there's
no
room
in
this
case,
i
think
were
the
suggestion,
that
the
car
owner's
replacement
of
the
fabric
alone
could
constitute
either
a
replacement
or
a
substantial
replacement
of
the
entire
system
which
was
the
subject
of
the
combination
patent
claim.
perhaps,
i
should
also
add
parenthetically
that
there
is
no
obstacle
or
whatever
provided
a
patentee
and
make
the
requisite
showing
that
the
standard
of
invention
meant.
there's
no
obstacle
whatever
to
obtaining
a
patent
on
the
combination
and
patent
rights
in
relation
to
a
sub-combination
or
an
ingredient
element.
this
court
has
recognized
that
one
can
obtain
both
kind
of
protection,
the
patent
office
in
--
in
numerable
instances
just
granted
patent
rights
both
in
relation
to
a
combination
and
in
relation
to
an
ingredient
element
of
the
combination.
and
so
what
we
have
here
essentially
is
the
--
a
result
in
this
case
which
permits
the
patentee
who
has
only
claimed
the
combination
of
the
entire
system.
a
result
which
permits
him
to
accomplish
the
very
thing
that
he
could've
accomplished
assuming
that
this
fabric
was
separately
patentable
that
he
could've
accomplished
if
he'd
gone
to
the
patent
office
made
the
claim
and
subjected
it
to
the
scrutiny
to
which
it
then
would've
been
subject.
now,
how
does
the
court
below
reach
the
conclusion
of
the
patentee's
rights
were
trespassed
by
the
fore
owner's
replacement
of
the
fabric?
it
deals
with
that
--
it's
the
court
of
appeals
summarizes
this
position
at
page
655
of
the
record
which
is
a
very
thin
volume
and
--
on
that
page,
it
notes
that
the
fabric
is
not
a
minor
or
relatively
inexpensive
component,
then
goes
on
to
add
that
the
fabric
does
not
wear
out
after
a
very
short
period
of
use.
although
it
recognizes
it
at
the
same
time
that
the
life
of
the
fabric
is
several
times
shorter
than
the
life
of
the
invertible
top
assembly
as
a
whole
or
to
deal
it
as
a
whole.
and
then
it
finally
concludes
that
the
car
owner
would
not
rationally
believe
that
he
was
making
only
a
minor
repair.
in
our
view,
the
court
had
gotten
the
wrong
answer
in
this
case
because
it
has
asked
the
wrong
question.
we
think
the
question
is
not
whether
the
unpatented
component
is
major
or
minor,
expensive
or
inexpensive,
not
whether
it
wears
out
every
two
months
or
every
two
years,
the
question
ultimately
to
be
answered
by
the
court
is
whether
the
man
who
has
bought
the
article
and
thereby
obtained
the
implied
right
to
used
it,
the
question
is
whether
he
has
abused
that
right
by
making
a
new
article,
by
recreating
the
entire
combination
which
alone
is
the
subject
that
protects.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
would
be
a
question
only
if
you
reach
an
issue
as
to
contributory
infringement.
the
statute
itself
makes
the
claim
in
271
(c)
that
there
is
no
action
for
contributory
infringement
except
--
insofar
if
there
is
a
contribution
to
direct
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
(voice
overlap)
and
271
(a)
leaves
the
law
of
direct
infringement
where
it
starts.
congress
was
explicit
that
it
was
not
attempting
to
legislate
on
the
subject
with
what
he
is
direct
infringement.
it
explains
that
if
one
can
make
clear
that
there
were
some
circumstances
in
which
actions
were
contributory
infringement
would
be
possible.
if
would
induce
to
provide
by
statute
for
contributory
infringement
action,
they
could
--
some
members
of
the
patent
bar
doubted
after
the
mercoid
case
of
what
scope
there
was
left
for
contributory
infringement
actions,
congress
said,
"we
want
to
authorize
and
make
clear
that
in
a
proper
case,
there
could
be
an
action
for
contributory
infringement
as
well
as
the
record."
and
so
your
honors
are
quite
right,
i
have
been
confining
myself
to
what
is
direct
infringement
and
that
is
why
i
put
aside
at
the
outset
the
situation
which
might
exist
if
fabric
were
being
supplied
to
a
manufacturer
who
was
then
getting
all
the
other
elements
assembling
them
all
and
creating
initially
the
patented
combination.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
the
reason.
the
reason
pursuing
the
contributory
and
the
alleged
contributory
infringer
is
that
you'd
have
to
sue
100
people
if
all
the
consumers
--
if
the
consumers
were
direct
--
were
the
direct
infringers
but
that
did
not
avoid
the
necessity
for
the
plaintiff
charging
infringement
establishing
the
user
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
is
a
direct
infringer.
he
doesn't
have
to
go
after
him
but
he
has
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
--
you
don't
have
to
hold
him
liable
but
he
has
to
establish
of
what
the
replacing
car
owner
did
was
the
direct
infringement,
this
whole
case
perhaps
on
that.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he's
--
the
statute
didn't
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
right.
i
--
i
--
that
point
i'm
making
it
and
perhaps
i
wasn't
clear
was
the
congress
didn't
provide
any
new
standard
or
test
as
to
what
a
direct
infringement
would
be.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
the
leading
case
in
this
court
as
to
the
question
of
permissible
repair
or
replacement
on
the
one
hand
versus
forbidden
reconstruction
of
the
entire
combination
on
the
other
is
wilson
against
simpson
to
which
i'd
like
to
refer
briefly.
that
was
the
case
in
which
there
was
a
claiming
machine
--
with
claiming
machine
which
consisted
among
other
things
of
a
pressure
roller
and
sets
it
nice.
and
that
the
patent
there
again
was
solely
on
the
combination.
the
question
which
arose
was
whether
the
man
who
had
bought
this
machine
would
replace
the
cutting
knife
when
they
wore
out
and
develop.
they
did
after
several
months
and
sustain
the
use.
and
this
court
said
in
that
case
that
to
be
sure
that
there
is
no
right
to
build
--
rebuild
the
machine
as
a
whole,
then
it
served,
however,
that
the
machine
continues
to
exist
even
though
certain
essential
parts,
essential
parts
have
become
worn
out.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
thank
you.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
in
the
very
few
minutes
remaining
to
me,
i
should
like
to
attempt
to
restate
briefly
the
propositions
argued
last
thursday
and
then
to
state
concisely
what
we
think
is
the
appropriate
test
which
should
govern
this
case.
my
starting
point
was
that
we
deal
here
with
the
combination
patent
by
the
convertible
top
assembly
and
that
none
of
the
individual
elements,
either
the
fabric,
nor
any
of
the
other
element,
has
been
separately
patented.
from
that,
it
follows
that
one
can
find
infringement
only
if
there
has
been
an
unauthorized
creation
or
recreation
of
the
entity,
for
that
alone
is
the
subject
to
patent
taxes.
now
in
this
case,
the
court
below
found
contributory
infringement
by
the
petitioner
although
the
top
fabric
was
supplied
only
for
purposes
of
replacing
worn
out
fabrics
and
not
in
any
instance,
for
purposes
of
building
a
new
convertible
top
assembly.
in
support
of
its
conclusion,
the
court
below
said
that
the
fabric
is
sufficiently
important,
sufficiently
expensive,
sufficiently
durable,
though
not
nearly
so
durable
as
the
cars
hold,
that
a
car
owner
would
not
rationally
believe
that
he
was
making
only
a
minor
repair.
now,
we
take
direct
issue
with
this
entire
line
of
reasoning.
we
urge
that
the
patent
on
a
combination
does
not
give
patent
protection
on
unpatented
parts,
whether
they
be
major
or
minor.
and
we
say
it
further
that
any
person
reading
the
patent
claim,
which
was
filed
in
this
case,
was
fully
entitled
to
believe
that
he
could
repair
or
replace
any
individual
component
of
the
machine,
when
that
component
in
ordinary
course,
wore
out.
i
spoke
the
other
day
at
the
close
of
this
court's
decision
in
wilson
against
simpson,
which
involved
a
combination
patent
on
a
planing
machine
and
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
the
cutting
knives
which
were
one
element
of
the
combination
could
be
replaced
as
they
wore
out.
and
in
so
holding,
the
court
said
"it
is
the
use
of
the
whole
of
the
combination
which
a
purchaser
buys."
then
the
court
went
on
to
say,
that
the
purchaser
may
not
be
deprived
of
the
right
"to
give
duration
to
that
which
he
owns
or
has
the
right
to
use
as
a
whole."
this
court
of
course,
has
followed
that
the
same
approach
in
other
similar
cases.
the
same
view,
we
think,
finds
conspicuous
support
in
decisions
of
the
--
second
circuit,
although
i
must
add
that
there
are
other
lower
federal
court
decisions
which
seem
to
adopt
the
approach
similar
to
that
adopted
by
the
firth
circuit
in
this
case.
among
the
second
circuit
cases
on
which
we
particularly
rely,
is
a
case
called
general
motors
against
preferred
electric,
which
is
particularly
interesting
in
that,
it,
like
in
this
case,
involves
replacement
of
automobile
parts.
the
patented
combination
in
that
case
was
on
a
circuit
breaking
system
which
was
designed
for
incorporation
into
an
automobile
ignition.
the
breaker
arms
and
certain
brackets
which
held
those
arms
wore
out
and
were
replaced.
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
that
case
that
the
breaker
arm
which
had
worn
out
was
the
very
gist
of
the
invention.
it
then
stated
that
nonetheless
since
the
breaker
arm
was
not
separately
patented
but
was
one
of
the
number
of
elements
that
the
owner
of
the
car
could
replace
it
at
will,
in
order
to
restore
the
machine.
and
in
still
another
second
circuit
case
though
not
one
involving
directly
the
issue
of
repair
versus
reconstruction,
judge
learned
hand
stated
what
we
think
is
the
gist
of
the
rule.
he
said,
"the
patent
monopolist
cannot
prevent
those
to
whom
he
sells
from
reconditioning
articles
worn
by
use,
unless
they
in
fact,
make
a
new
article"
and
i
think
that
sums
up
the
--
the
test
we
urge.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
was
in
alcoa
case,
your
honor.
we
state
--
say
that
true
reconstruction
means
making
a
new
article
after
the
machine
viewed
as
a
whole
has
been
destroyed
or
has
otherwise
deteriorated.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
we
say
that
even
assuming
that
the
--
the
possibility
that
the
material
itself
might've
been
the
subject
of
a
separate
patent
that
it
was
not
in
fact
a
patent
and
no
claim
was
made
to
a
patent
based
on
the
shape
of
the
fabric.
therefore,
we
say
that
no
more
than
a
single
element
of
a
multi-element
combination
is
being
replaced.
and
at
a
minimum,
we
argue
that
replacement
of
an
individual
worn
out
part
of
a
multi-element
combination
cannot
properly
be
deemed
anything
more
than
the
owner's
right
to
maintain
his
property
and
to
enjoy
its
(inaudible)
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
they
found
that
in
some
instances
they
were
unattractive
and
in
other
instances
they
wore
out
and
that
the
court
put
aside
any
question
of
the
distinction
between
replacing
it
for
reasons
of
taste
and
replacing
it
because
its
utility
had
completely
disappeared.
it
said
--
the
district
court
said
that
it
had
no
doubt
that
this
constituted
replacement
of
something
that
was
no
longer
usable.
and
the
basis
of
its
decision
was
that
--
that
this
was
a
major
replacement
in
this
case.
i
think
i'm
beginning
to
trench
on
time
reserved
by
petitioner
for
rebuttal
your
honor.
