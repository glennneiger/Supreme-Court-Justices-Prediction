in

this
should've
been

supposing

he
then
goes
to
a
competitor,

like
your

is
a

the

can

could

ask

one
more
question

i
will
try
not
to
interrupt
you
after

just
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
thinking.
does
your
position
describe
what
sometimes
is
called
the
basis
of
difficulty
between
reconstruction,
repair
or
replacement
insofar
as
the
article
itself
is
an
unpatented
component
of
the
combination
of
patents,
you
discard
that
distinction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
limiting
myself
simply
to
an
unpatented
component
--
unpatented
combination.
i
thought
you
said
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
in
your
view
what
the
reason
was
for
the
replacement
of
that
one
unpatented
element.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it's
really
construction
or
repair?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
name
of
that
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
were
the
lower
court's
findings
as
to
the
condition
of
the
top
when
it
was
replaced
or
detached?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
validity
of
the
patent
at
issue?
justice

they
are

manufacturer,
one
of
which
has
the
old
fashioned
top

could
you
take
the
canvass,

it
does?

don't

what
the
virtue
of
this,
what
the
significance
on

is
here

understood,
i
have
said
