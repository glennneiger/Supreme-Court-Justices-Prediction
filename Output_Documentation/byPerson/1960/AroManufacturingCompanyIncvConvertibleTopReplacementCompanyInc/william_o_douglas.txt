does
that
testify
(inaudible)?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
do
you
say
about
the
respondent's
argument
that
--
that
had
been,
is
not
the
substitution
of
material
here
but
that
if
the
infringement
is
in
the
shape
of
the
--
the
distinctive
feature
of
the
--
this
patent
is
the
shape
of
this
material.
i
think
that's
what
the
--
that's
the
line
that
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
you
are
on
common
ground
would
be
of
the
petitioner
at
that
point.
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
the
claims
in
--
in
the
record
--
i
don't
--
i'm
unable
to
find
them.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
well,
the
government,
their
counsel
says
that
the
--
the
shape
was
not
a
part
of
the
invention.
justice
william
o.
douglas
within
--
within
the
meaning
of
the
--
within
the
limits
of
the
claim.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
claims
are
on
page
594,
aren't
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
start
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
--
i
haven't
found
the
word,
shape,
at
least
there.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
only
thing
i
see
about
the
material
is
that
it's
flexible
top
material.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
shape
there
is
the
--
is
the
shape
of
the
folding
mechanism
as
i
see
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
