mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
predicated
exclusively
upon
a
finding
that
the
employment
of
workers
is
based
upon
a
discriminatory
hiring
procedure.
the
board
may
require
the
refund
to
those
workers
of
the
union
dues
and
fees
they
pay
to
the
unions
which
represented
them
and
of
which
they
are
members.
the
refund
order
may,
as
in
this
case,
run
against
the
unions
alone.
it
may,
as
in
the
preceding
case
and
the
case
which
follows,
run
against
the
employer
and
the
union.
it
may,
as
in
other
cases,
run
against
the
employer
alone,
whether
it
runs
against
the
union
alone,
the
employer
alone
or
both
together,
depends
upon
the
fortuity
whether
the
person
filing
the
unfair
labor
charge
has
filed
it
against
the
union
alone,
the
employer
alone
or
both
together.
in
all
these
cases,
we
deal
with
unions
which
are
freely
chosen
by
the
employees
to
represent
them
in
collective
bargains.
it
is
unquestioned
and
unquestionable
that
the
teamsters
union,
the
carpenters
union,
the
typographical
union
are
the
rightful
representatives
of
the
employees
for
whom
they
act
and
to
whom
the
dues
and
fees
were
paid.
now,
the
question
in
this
case
arises
in
these
circumstances.
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters,
the
international
union,
has
an
agreement
with
an
employer
called
mechanical
handling
systems
by
which
the
employer
agrees
to
work
the
hours,
pay
the
wages
and
abide
by
the
rules
and
regulations
established
by
the
local
union
of
the
carpenters
and
employ
members
of
the
united
brotherhood
of
carpenters
and
joiners.
this
employer,
mechanical
handling
systems,
started
a
construction
job
on
the
premises
of
the
ford
motor
company
in
indianapolis.
a
few
days
after
the
job
was
started,
the
business
representative
of
the
district
council
came
to
the
job
and
met
with
the
superintendent
of
the
company
on
the
job.
they
agreed
that
the
wages,
hours
and
other
working
conditions
on
that
job
were
to
be
governed
by
an
agreement
between
the
local
construction
association,
the
local
employer
construction
association
and
the
district
council.
they
also
agreed
that
the
millwrights
and
carpenters
that
the
employer
would
need
on
the
job
would
be
obtained
by
referral
from
either
the
district
council
or
local
60,
which
is
a
constituent
local
of
the
district
council.
now,
by
the
rules
of
the
district
council
and
local
60,
referral
was
restricted
to
union
members,
nonmembers
would
not
be
referred
on
the
job.
in
practice,
the
millwrights
and
carpenters
working
on
this
job
were
restricted
to
those
who
were
union
members.
there
were
two
applicants
for
employment
who
came
to
this
job
seeking
work.
they
were
members
of
a
local
union
of
the
carpenters
in
louisville,
kentucky.
they
travelled
to
indianapolis,
they
applied
for
work
at
the
job,
they
were
denied
work
because
they
could
not
get
a
working
permit
from
the
district
council
and
they
could
not
get
a
working
permit
from
the
district
council
because
unemployment
in
the
indianapolis
area
was
widespread
and
the
union's
policy
was
not
to
refer
persons
from
out
of
the
area,
if
there
were
unemployment
within
the
area.
now,
the
board
found
that
the
union
and
the
employer
were
operating
under
a
closed-shop
preferential
hiring
system
and
this
was
illegal.
we
do
not
contest
that
finding.
the
board
also
found
that
the
two
applicants
for
employment
were
discriminatorily
denied
work.
the
board
ordered
the
unions
to
cease
and
desist
from
this
activity
including
execution
of
such
agreements.
we
do
not
contest
that
part
of
the
order.
the
board
ordered
that
the
two
workers
who
were
denied
employment
are
to
be
made
whole.
but
the
board
went
further
and
said
that
the
unions
were
to
return
to
the
employees
who
have
worked
on
the
job,
all
the
union
dues
and
fees
they
had
paid
beginning
with
a
period
of
six
months
preceding
the
filing
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
it
is
that
part
of
the
order
which
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
now,
the
board
supports
this
kind
of
a
refund
order
on
two
theories.
both
are
essential
to
its
reason
for
imposing
a
refund
order.
the
first
is
what
i
think
we
can
call
the
notion
of
inevitable
coercion.
now,
i
think
it
can
be
fairly
paraphrased
in
these
sentences.
given
a
discriminatory
hiring
procedure,
employees
are
inevitably
coerced
to
pay
moneys
to
the
union.
the
existence
of
an
unlawful
contract
is
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
to
establish
the
element
of
coercion.
the
refund
remedy
is,
therefore,
without
more
applicable
to
all
closed-shop
and
exclusive
hiring
agreements,
whether
or
not
proof
of
actual
exaction
of
payments
is
established.
the
only
operative
fact
in
the
board's
thinking
is
a
finding
of
a
discriminatory
hiring
procedure.
i
think
i
can
show
--
i
shall
try
to
show
in
a
moment
that
this
is
the
rationalization
for
the
order,
that
the
real
reason
for
the
order
is
something
else.
the
real
reason,
i
think,
was
expressed
by
the
board
in
these
words,
“we
believe
that
a
mere
cease
and
desist
order
will
have
little
impact
in
an
industry
where
illegal
hiring
practices
are
widespread.
the
reimbursement
order
more
properly
effectuates
the
purposes
of
the
act
because
it
provides
not
only
a
deterrent
to
future
violations,
but
an
incentive
to
future
compliance."
in
our
view,
the
heart
of
the
refund
remedy,
as
currently
used,
is
to
coerced
compliance
with
the
board's
conception
of
a
valid
hiring
agreement.
let's
begin
with
the
notion
of
inevitable
coercion.
i
think
the
board's
argument
can
be
reduced
to
two
sentences.
men
on
the
job
must
be
union
members.
therefore,
men
on
the
job
were
forced
to
join
the
union
against
their
will.
this
is
like
saying
that
men
who
practice
law
must
have
ll.b.
degrees.
therefore,
men
who
practice
law
went
to
law
school
against
their
will.
now,
the
fallacy
is
obvious.
the
premise
is
simply
inadequate
to
support
the
conclusion.
the
conclusion
states,
but
the
premise
does
not
establish
that
the
only
reason
employees
join
unions
is
to
escape
the
discrimination
presumably
exercised
by
unions
against
nonmembers.
now,
most
of
us
have
thought
that
the
reason
that
employees
join
unions
is
somewhat
different.
most
of
us
have
thought
that
the
reason
was
properly
identified
in
the
preamble
to
the
statute,
stating
the
policy
of
the
statute,
in
which
the
condition
which
the
statute
identifies
as
the
reason
for
union
membership,
is
the
inequality
of
bargaining
power
between
employees
who
do
not
possess
full
freedom
of
association
or
actual
liberty
of
contract
and
employers
who
are
organized
in
the
corporate
or
other
forms
of
ownership
association.
and
the
policy
continues
that
the
statute
is
designed
to
promote
union
organization
and
collective
bargaining
for
the
purpose
of
restoring
equality
of
bargaining
power
between
employers
and
unions.
and
what
the
statute
identifies
as
the
reason
for
union
membership
was
given
expression
by
this
court
almost
40
years
ago.
and
at
that
time,
this
court
was
stating
what
was
already
been
a
commonplace.
labor
unions
were
organized
out
of
the
necessities
of
the
situation.
a
single
employee
was
helpless
in
dealing
with
an
employer.
union
was
essential
to
give
laborers
opportunity
to
deal
on
equality
with
their
employer.
now,
if
it
is
true,
as
i
think
it
demonstrably
is,
that
people
join
unions
in
order
to
have
the
strength
that
comes
from
group
action.
it
is
also
demonstrably
true
that
they
pay
and
willingly
pay
union
dues
and
fees
to
the
organization.
everyone
knows
and
employees
know
that
no
organization
can
exist
without
money.
if
you
want
a
union,
you
have
to
have
dues
in
order
to
run
a
union.
and
what
everybody
knows
was
proven
beyond
cavil
during
the
four-year
period
between
1947
and
1952.
during
that
time,
there
was
a
provision
in
the
taft-hartley
act
which
stated
that
before
an
employer
and
a
union
could
validly
enter
into
a
union
shop
agreement,
there
must
first
be
an
election
among
the
employees
at
which
the
employees
were
to
decide
whether
or
not,
they
wish
to
authorize
the
union
to
enter
into
a
union
shop
agreement,
an
agreement
which
would
obligate
the
employees
to
pay
union
dues
and
fees.
during
this
period,
the
provision
was
repealed
1952,
during
this
period,
46,119
elections
were
conducted.
in
44,795
of
them
or
97%
of
the
cases,
the
employees
authorized
unions
to
enter
into
union
shop
agreements
obligating
the
payment
of
dues.
in
those
elections,
about
5,300,000
employees
were
polled,
4,800,000
of
them
or
91.5%
authorized
the
union
to
negotiate
union
shop
agreements
obligating
the
payment
of
dues.
so
it
seems
to
us
that
the
premise
upon
which
the
board
starts,
that
union
dues
and
fees
are
involuntarily
paid,
unwillingly
paid,
is
in
defiance
of
what
everybody
in
this
field
knows.
and
it's
a
particularly
odd
assumption
when
it
is
entertained,
as
in
this
case,
in
the
building
and
construction
industry.
because
if
the
building
and
construction
industry
is
and
has
been
highly
unionized
for
a
long
time,
in
1927,
well
before
the
wagner
act
either,
a
careful
study
in
this
field
stated
that
in
many
large
cities,
the
building
construction
workers
are,
for
all
practical
purposes,
completely
organized.
in
other
cities,
their
claim
to
an
organized
strength
varying
from
60%
to
nearly
100%
of
building
workers
cannot
seriously
be
disputed.
in
1958,
the
bureau
of
labor
statistics
reported
that
2.6
million
workers
in
the
building
and
construction
industry,
2.3
million
of
them
were
union
members.
and
yet
we
have
in
this
case,
a
refund
order
predicative
on
the
notion
that
the
workers
on
this
job
were
inevitably
coerced
into
paying
dues
to
the
union.
interestingly,
what
the
board
disregards,
congress
in
1959
recognized.
in
1959,
congress
enacted
section
8
(f)
which
in
the
building
and
construction
field
validated
what
we
call
a
pre-hire
agreement.
a
pre-hire
agreement
is
one
which
authorizes
an
employer
and
a
union
to
enter
into
an
agreement,
covering
employment
on
a
particular
job,
before
any
employees
are
hired
for
work
upon
that
job.
absent
8
(f),
it
has
been
the
board's
view
and
is
the
board's
view,
that
you
cannot
validly
enter
into
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
before
a
representative
number
of
employees
have
been
hired,
because
in
the
absence
of
a
representative
number
of
employees,
you
cannot
know
whether
a
majority
within
the
unit
choose
union
representation.
this
rule
was
eliminated
by
congress
in
section
8
(f)
and
one
of
the
important
reasons
supporting
the
elimination
was
recognition
that
in
this
industry,
there
was
no
question
but
that
the
people
working
on
construction
jobs
would
be
union
men
who
had
chosen
the
union
to
represent
them.
the
senate
report
put
it
this
way.
a
substantial
majority
of
the
skilled
employees
in
this
industry
constitute
a
pool
of
help
centered
about
their
appropriate
craft
union.
if
the
employer
relies
upon
this
pool
of
skilled
craftsmen,
members
of
the
union,
there
is
no
doubt
under
these
circumstances
that
the
union
will,
in
fact,
represent
a
majority
of
the
employees
eventually
hired.
now,
what
is
there
in
this
case
to
suggest
that
the
employees
on
this
job
were
not
part
of
this
long
standing
voluntary
tradition
of
union
membership
in
the
building
and
construction
field?
and
the
answer
is
nothing.
all
these
employees
were
members
of
the
union
before
they
began
working
on
the
job.
there
is
no
evidence
that
a
single
one
of
them
joined
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
or
securing
work
on
this
job.
for
the
all
the
board
knows
or
cares,
they
could
all
have
been
union
members,
members
of
the
carpenters
union,
for
every
single
day
of
their
working
life.
the
board
says,
"well,
even
assuming
that
they
weren't
--
they
were
all
voluntary
union
members
when
the
job
began,
they
couldn't
leave
the
union
during
the
period
that
the
job
was
going
on
and
still
continue
to
work
on
the
job.
and
so
their
continuance
in
the
membership
was
coerced
and
hence,
their
payment
of
union
dues
and
fees
is
coerced."
now,
this
is
a
pretty
silly
argument
because
it
requires
us
to
believe
that
if
there
hadn't
been
a
closed-shop
agreement
on
this
job,
these
employees
after
they
began
working
on
the
job
would've
all
left
the
union
for
the
period
of
this
job
and
would've
all
ceased
paying
dues.
well,
as
i
say,
this
is
silly.
people
in
the
building
and
construction
industry
are
union
members
by
tradition.
what
is
unthinkable
to
them
is
leaving
the
union,
not
being
coerced
into
the
union.
the
conception
that
a
closed-shop
agreement
coerces
employees
in
the
building
and
construction
trade
is
simply
not
responsive
to
what
employees
in
this
industry
themselves
feel
for
they
regard
a
system
of
employment
based
on
union
membership
as
a
service
to
them,
not
coercive
of
them.
it
seems
to
us
fair
to
say,
that
if
we
are
talking
about
exaction
of
payments
in
any
realistic
sense,
the
board
is
simply
without
--
the
beginning
of
a
solid
foundation
upon
which
to
predicate
an
argument
that
the
fees
and
dues
were
unwillingly
paid.
and
that
the
fees
and
dues
were
not
--
if
the
employees
were
not
coerced
in
paying
them,
there
is
obviously
no
basis
for
requiring
a
return
of
moneys
which
were
voluntarily
paid.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
what
the
board
has
itself
said.
it
doesn't
really
care
about
exaction
of
payments.
it
imposes
this
remedy
as
it
says
whether
or
not
proof
of
actual
exaction
of
payments
is
established.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
they
will
not
allow
a
proof.
they
have,
in
more
than
one
case,
rejected
an
offer
of
proof
by
which
the
union
proposed
to
show
that
each
of
the
employees
paid
union
dues
and
fees
willingly
and
that
the
payment
was
unrelated
to
the
hiring
procedure
found
by
the
board
to
be
discriminatory.
the
board
said,
“we
are
indifferent
to
that
offer
of
proof,
given
the
discriminatory
hiring
procedure
that
is
all
we
care
about."
now,
if
one
reads
the
board's
decisions
in
this
field
and
if
one
knew
nothing
about
labor
unions
and
how
they
work,
one
would
not
have
the
least
idea
that
union
dues
and
fees
do
not
repost
in
depositories
accumulating
compound
interest.
if
one
came
down
from
mars
and
read
the
board's
decisions,
one
wouldn't
have
the
least
idea
that
dues
and
fees
go
to
pay
the
cost
of
negotiating
agreements.
they
go
to
pay
the
cost
of
arbitrating
grievances.
they
go
to
pay
for
lawyers,
economists,
actuaries
and
other
professional
personnel.
they
go
towards
maintaining
a
staff.
they
go
towards
paying
intra-union
benefits.
if
you
read
the
board's
decisions,
you
would
not
know
that
this
was
a
factor
which
existed.
the
board
requires
the
refund
of
union
dues
and
fees
utterly
and
different
to
the
fact
that
those
fees
and
dues
paid
for
services.
now,
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
the
board
would
give
these
employees
the
benefit
of
union
representation
which
we
--
without
requiring
a
contribution
to
defrayal
of
the
expense.
it
goes
beyond
that.
because
if
it
is
true,
as
it
is,
that
the
fees
go
towards
payment
of
the
expenses
for
services,
the
moneys
have
been
spent.
if
you
require
a
refund
of
moneys,
where
do
you
get
them?
money
has
to
come
from
somewhere.
so
what
reimbursement
really
comes
down
to
at
least
and
so
far
as
unions
are
concerned,
is
that
the
employees
on
this
job
will
have
the
benefits
they
receive
from
union
representation
paid
for
by
the
fees
and
dues
paid
by
employees
on
other
jobs.
we
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
this
effectuates
any
policy
of
the
act.
we
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
draining
the
union's
treasury
and
to
the
extent
of
the
drain,
detracting
from
its
capacity
to
function
in
collective
bargaining,
in
adjustment
of
grievances,
in
administering
intra-union
benefit
programs,
effectuates
any
policy
of
the
act.
now,
we
have
to
assume,
i
think,
that
the
board
must
know
all
of
these.
it
must
know
that
you
--
people
join
unions
because
they
need
the
bargaining
power
that
come
from
unions.
it
must
know
that
services
are
gotten
from
union
dues.
it
must
know
that
union
dues
and
fees,
once
they
are
spent
that
you
require
them
refunded,
have
to
come
from
the
coffers
of
other
employees.
what
then
if
it
knows
all
these
is
the
actual
reason
for
this
refund
remedy?
and
the
actual
reason,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
i
have
quoted
before.
this
is
an
in
terrorem
device
by
which
the
board
would
compel
unions
and
employers
to
acquiesce
in
its
version
of
what
constitutes
a
valid
hiring
agreement.
the
thing
which
makes
this
an
in
terrorem
device,
which
makes
it
coercive,
is
the
staggering
financial
liability
which
is
entailed
in
such
a
remedy.
in
the
employer's
brief
in
the
next
case,
on
page
3,
we
are
told,
"the
potential
liability
of
this
respondent
under
the
board's
order
now
exceeds
$350,000
and
it's
growing
at
the
rate
of
close
to
$7000
as
each
month
passes.”
this
already
staggering
liability
is
fantastically
multiplied
where
a
union
is
a
party
to
a
multi-employer
agreement.
for
the
board
tells
us
this
when
a
union
is
a
party
to
a
multi-employer
agreement
in
cases
involving
multi-employer
contracts,
in
which
the
contracting
union
and
one
or
more
employers
are
named
respondent
parties
to
the
contract,
the
union's
liability
for
reimbursement
of
sums
unlawfully
exacted,
all
social
extend
to
all
the
employees
covered
under
such
contract
found
unlawful.
so
that
if
the
union
should
be
administering
a
multi-employer
contract
of
10
employers
or
100
employers,
according
to
the
board,
it
should
read
from
the
dues
and
fees
paid
by
the
employees,
working
for
those
10
employers
or
100
employers,
based
exclusively
upon
a
finding
that
the
board
find
something
in
this
agreement
which
constitutes
it
says
a
discriminatory
hiring
procedure.
now,
we
can
trace
the
actual
purpose
and
the
actual
use
to
which
this
remedy
has
been
put
in
relationship
to
the
history
of
a
preceding
case,
number
85,
the
hiring
hall
case.
the
board's
refund
remedy
in
its
current
posture
was
enunciated
in
the
case
called
brown-olds
and
that's
the
name
by
which
this
remedy
now
goes.
that
case
came
down
in
february
of
1956.
about
two
years
later,
the
general
counsel,
the
then
general
counsel
of
the
board,
sent
an
open
letter
to
employers
and
unions
in
the
building
and
construction
industry.
he
said
to
them,
"you
have
three
months
within
which
to
collect
--
in
which
to
correct
your
hiring
agreements.
if
you
correct
them
within
the
three
months,
we
will
not
impose
this
refund
remedy.
if
you
do
not
correct
them
within
these
three
months,
we
will
impose
this
remedy."
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir,
this
is
on
page
35
of
our
brief
and
we
trace
this
history
from
page
35,
rule
40
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
now,
after
this
letter
would
come
out,
the
board
decided
the
mountain
pacific
chapter
case
on
april
1st,
1958.
that
is
the
case
in
which
for
the
board
for
the
first
time
said
that
in
order
to
validate
an
exclusive
referral
system
of
employment,
you
have
to
incorporate
into
the
agreement,
these
three
magic
requirements.
three
weeks
later,
the
board
--
the
general
counsel
of
the
board
sends
another
letter,
open
letter
to
the
employers
and
unions
in
the
building
and
construction
trade.
he
says,
“well,
now,
you
know
that
the
board
has
decided
mountain
pacific
chapter
and
you
know
you
have
to
include
in
your
agreements
these
three
requirements.
to
give
you
a
chance
to
negotiate
into
your
agreements
these
three
requirements,
i
will
extend
the
deadline.
i
will
give
you
now
until
september
1st,
1958
to
fix
up
your
agreements.
if
you
do
it
within
that
time,
no
refund
remedy.
if
you
don't,
a
refund
remedy
will
be
imposed.”
then
the
last
open
letter
was
sent
by
the
general
counsel.
this
time
on
august
19th,
1958,
in
which
he
said,
“i'm
not
going
to
extend
this
deadline
any
further
except
to
this
extent.
if
employers
and
unions
are
currently
in
the
process
of
making
genuine
efforts
to
correct
their
agreements
and
if
they
had
consummate
their
efforts
by
november
1st,
1958,
no
refund
remedy.
if
you
fail
to
do
so
by
november
1st,
1958,
a
refund
remedy
will
be
imposed.”
mr.
bernard
dunau
nothing
determines
it
except
whether
the
person
filing
the
charge
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
has
happened
to
file
it
against
one
or
the
other
or
both.
that's
the
only
thing.
if
the
charge
is
filed
against
both,
the
board
will
impose
it
against
both.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
would
not
in
law,
be
required
to
say
that
it
must
run
against
both.
it
could,
if
it
had
sound
reasons
to
choose
one
against
the
other.
but
what
it
does
do
is
have
it
run
against
both,
simply
upon
the
finding
that
both
were
parties
to
the
procedure.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i
can
say
that,
i
think
in
--
in
--
very
briefly,
virginia
electric
pertained
to
a
case
in
which
the
finding
was
that
the
company
--
that
the
union
was
company-dominated
and
that
the
union
dues
and
fees
paid
to
this
company-dominated
union
were
paid
pursuant
to
a
closed-shop
agreement.
the
order
required
the
dissolution
of
that
union
and
in
conjunction
with
the
dissolution
of
that
union,
it
required
the
refund
of
dues
and
fees.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
day,
one
can
say
that
the
teamsters
union
or
the
carpenters
union
or
the
typographical
union
is
a
company-dominated
union
on
that
day
virginia
electric
would
be
relevant
to
our
problem.
on
the
day
that
the
board
could
validly
enter
an
order
requiring
the
dissolution
of
the
teamsters
union
or
the
carpenters
union
or
the
typographical
union,
on
that
day,
virginia
electric
would
become
relevant
to
our
problem.
but
until
that
day
comes,
if
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
lawyers
and
law
is
the
capacity
to
draw
relevant
distinctions,
it
seems
to
us
that
one
mark
of
the
invalidity
of
the
refund
remedy
in
this
case,
is
that
the
fact
that
the
board
draws
on
virginia
electric
to
support
it.
it
seems
to
us
to
be
poles
apart
to
have
an
order
requiring
the
refund
of
dues
in
conjunction
with
a
union
which
is
not
a
fit
representative
and
is
ordered
dissolved,
that
seems
to
us
to
be
of
the
opposite
extreme
from
a
refund
order
running
against
--
pertaining
to
a
union
whose
right
to
exist
and
to
function
and
to
represent
employees
is
altogether
unquestioned.
now,
going
back
to
this
open
letter,
this
last
one
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct,
we
do
not
defend
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
agree
that
the
board
can
require
a
cessation
of
this
kind
of
an
activity,
require
the
employer
and
the
union
to
stop
entering
into
such
contracts.
we
agree
that
anybody
who's
lost
a
job
by
virtue
of
the
operation
of
this
kind
of
a
system,
may
have
--
may
be
made
whole
for
the
loss
of
moneys.
what
we
do
not
agree
here,
is
that
the
sanction
can
go
so
far
as
to
require
a
refund
of
union
dues
and
fees
because,
as
we
see
it,
the
only
valid
foundation
for
requiring
a
refund
of
union
dues
and
fees
would
be
a
solid
finding
that
those
fees
and
dues
were
involuntarily
paid.
the
existence
of
a
discriminatory
hiring
procedure
does
not
establish
a
solid
basis
for
finding
that
the
dues
and
fees
were
involuntarily
paid.
in
other
words,
as
we
see
it,
the
wrong
exists,
but
the
remedy
is
totally
unrelated
to
the
wrong.
it
is
not
enough
to
--
to
say
that
the
board
should
not
be
impotent,
is
to
say
that
the
board
has
been
given
by
congress
the
power
to
impose
fines,
money
fines
to
deter
violations
or
to
compel
compliance.
if
the
board
had
been
given
the
power
to
impose
fines,
there
would
be
more
to
be
said
on
behalf
of
this
remedy,
but
we
have
to
take
it,
and
i
think
the
board
would
agree,
that
the
board
were
to
say,
upon
a
finding
of
a
discriminatory
hiring
procedure,
the
employer
and
the
union
are
fined
$1000,
$10,000,
$100,000,
the
board
would
have
no
power
to
say
that.
that
the
board
has
done
just
that
in
this
type
of
case,
the
board
imposes
a
fine
and
it
measures
the
fine
by
the
number
of
employees
subject
to
procedure
and
it
multiplies
that
number
by
the
dues
they
have
paid
and
the
initiation
fees
they
have
paid.
mr.
bernard
dunau
a
--
a
finding
based
on
substantial
evidence
that
a
particular
employee
made
him
--
coerced
onto
paying
dues
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
is
a
--
an
order
based
on
such
a
finding
is
one
we
would
not
contest.
we
think
that
would
be
within
the
board's
power.
what
we
--
what
we
say
here
is
the
findings
that
were
made
are
simply
not
commensurate
with
the
order
that
was
(inaudible).
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
two.
this
--
what
the
board
is
--
in
--
in
terms
of
the
board's
justification,
it
says,
it
wants
to
deter
violations.
fine.
you
can
deter
violations
too,
i
presume,
if
the
board
were
to
enter
an
order
requiring
that
employer
and
union
representatives
that
engaged
in
discriminatory
hiring
were
to
be
flogged.
this,
i
presume,
would
deter
violations.
people
don't
like
to
be
flogged.
well,
the
board
wouldn't
have
any
power
to
enter
that
kind
of
an
order
and
it
seems
to
us,
it
has
no
more
power
to
enter
an
order
which
requires
financial
flogging,
rather
than
physical
flogging.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
history
of
the
use
of
this
remedy
discloses
precisely
that
the
purpose
of
it
is
not
to
make
employees
whole
for
dues
which
they
unwillingly
pay.
the
purpose
rather
is
to
compel
unions
and
employers
to
do
what
the
board
wants
them
to
do
with
respect
to
their
hiring
procedures.
mr.
bernard
dunau
except
for
the
court
below,
every
court
of
appeals,
which
has
considered
this
remedy,
has
denounced
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
second,
the
third,
the
fifth,
the
sixth,
the
ninth
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuits.
the
tenth
has
not
had
it.
the
first
has
had
it
in
equivocal
postures.
the
seventh
circuit,
the
one
we
have
here
in
a
subsequent
case,
it
seems
to
us,
to
have
already
began
to
withdraw
from
what
it
said
in
this
case.
i
should
say
that
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
at
past,
there's
only
one
circuit
as
we
see
it
which
has
approved
the
board's
refund
remedy
in
this
part
of
a
situation
when
it
has
had
it
on
the
merits.
now,
as
i
said,
november
1
was
the
deadline
that
the
general
counsel
imposed
for
getting
these
agreements
in
the
compliance.
then,
on
october
31st,
1958,
one
day
before
the
expiration
of
the
deadline,
down
comes
the
order
in
number
58,
the
preceding
case
in
which
a
refund
remedy
is
imposed.
the
first
time
that
a
refund
remedy
is
imposed
based
upon
a
finding
that
a
hiring
hall
provision
is
illegal
because
of
the
failure
to
improve
these
three
requirements.
the
board
(inaudible)
point
to
which
general
counsel's
threat,
“if
you
don't
put
your
agreements
into
the
shape
that
we
think
they
ought
to
be
in,
you're
going
to
pay
by
the
refund
of
dues
and
fees.”
we
don't
even
have
to
infer
this
from
these,
the
course
of
these
letters
and
what
happened.
the
general
counsel
and
board
members
have
been
quite
open
about
what
they
were
doing.
i
read
from
page
40
what
had
then
general
counsel
of
the
board
have
said,
“the
subsequent
history
of
the
mountain
pacific
decision."
that's
the
hiring
hall
decision.
mr.
bernard
dunau
at
page
40
of
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
subsequent
history
of
the
mountain
pacific
decision
has
been,
in
large
part,
a
concerted
program
by
this
agency
to
encourage
appropriate
affirmative
action
by
the
contracting
parties
to
conform
their
collective
agreements
and
hiring
practices
to
the
requirements
of
mountain
pacific.
in
this
respect,
the
major
spur
has
been
the
so-called
brown-olds
remedy.
they
identified
the
spur
as
imposing
a
liability
which
may
involve
substantial
sums
of
money.
he
stated
deterrence
as
the
underlying
consideration
and
did
this.
and
he
described
the
period
of
the
moratorium
as
a
period
of
reprieve.
in
another
instance,
he
spoke
of
this
remedy
as
a
sword
of
damocles,
which
hung
over
the
heads
of
employers
and
unions.
and
he
said
in
using
the
sword
of
damocles,
mixing
a
metaphor
somewhat,
we
paid
he
to
the
only
adage
of
one
of
our
very
own
citizens,
who
practiced
what
he
preached
at
the
turn
of
this
20th
century.
i
refer
to
president
teddy
roosevelt.
he
carried
a
big
stick
and
with
it,
he
went
far.
we
spoke
softly
and
carried
a
big
sword
and
the
results
to
date
had
been
heartily.
a
board
member
described
this
remedy
as
putting
teeth
into
the
law.
i
read
from
page
42
in
--
of
our
brief.
we
refer
to
it
as
the
stinger.
another
board
member
said,
"we
use
this
remedy
to
interest
companies
and
unions
in
the
problem
of
observing
the
law."
they
said,
“we
want
them
to
pay
some
attention
to
what
we
are
saying.”
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
they
should
pay
attention
to
the
law
which
is
frequent
to
something
very
different
from
what
we
believe
the
court
expounds
it
to
be.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
basis
for
a
refund
remedy
in
a
company-dominated
union
situation
was
that
the
employees
unwillingly
pay
their
moneys
to
the
company-dominated
union.
when
such
a
finding
can
be
made
in
the
case
of
the
kind
that
we
have
here,
which
is
typical
of
these
kinds
of
cases,
then
one
can
make
a
finding
on
a
record
that
will
stand
that
the
dues
and
fees
were
--
willingly
paid,
then
the
remedy
that
was
appropriate
in
the
company-dominated
union
situation,
would
be
appropriate
here.
but
until
one
can
equate
the
two,
until
one
can
say
that
dues
and
fees
paid
under
a
closed-shop
agreement
to
a
company-dominated
union
are
the
same
as
dues
and
fees
paid
by
employees
to
freely
chosen
unions,
there
is
no
parallel
between
the
two
situations.
i
would
like
to
mention
this.
the
notion
that
the
board
should
not
be
impotent,
assuming
that
its
present
remedies
make
it
so,
is
something
that
ought
to
be,
it
seems
to
us,
addressed
to
congress.
the
board
ought
to
go
to
congress
and
say,
"cease
and
desist
orders
and
make
whole
orders
are
just
not
enough."
we
ought
to
be
able
to
fine
employees.
these
things
ought
to
be
made
criminal
for
violations
of
criminal
laws,
so
we
can
put
some
people
into
jail.
but
the
congress
has
not
doubt
in
that.
the
remedial
scheme
under
this
act
is
just
that,
remedial.
the
only
justification
for
reimbursement
orders
under
this
statute
is
to
make
somebody
whole,
to
give
him
back
that
which
was
wrongfully
taken
from
him,
unless
that
precondition
can
be
established.
unless
a
finding
on
substantial
evidence
can
be
made
that
something
was
taken
from
another
which
he
would
not
have
given
up
but
for
the
unfair
labor
practice,
there
is
no
basis
within
the
limitations
of
this
remedial
scheme
for
a
reimbursement
order.
as
judge
goodrich
put
to
the
third
circuit,
"imposition
of
fines
or
jail
sentences
upon
employers
and
unions
would
also
be
a
deterrent
so
far
as
such
sanctions
can
act
as
a
deterrent.
but
a
fine
is
clearer
than
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
and
the
labor
board
is
not
authorized
to
impose
penalties."
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
told
that
the
reason
for
a
closed-shop
practice
is
to
compel
payment
of
dues
which
would
otherwise
not
be
paid.
this
is
a
novel
reading
of
industrial
history.
the
reason
for
a
closed-shop
practice
is
to
safeguard
for
members
of
the
unions,
the
available
work
opportunities.
it
--
in
the
competition
forward
between
members
and
nonmembers,
members
are
favored.
this
is
a
wrong,
but
the
wrong
is
not
one
which
is
designed
to
collect
dues.
we
would
--
to
follow
the
argument
that
a
closed-shop
practice
has
for
its
purpose
to
collect
the
dues
and
if
closed-shop
practices
were
only
eliminated,
the
conclusion
we
would
have
that
there
would
be
no
building
and
construction
trade
unions
in
this
country.
if
only
building
--
if
only
closed-shop
practices
were
eliminated,
the
2.3
million
people
who
are
now
members
of
building
and
construction
trade
unions,
which
ceased
to
be.
now,
if
the
purpose,
as
we
are
told,
of
this
refund
remedy
is
to
restore
dues
that
would
not
have
been
paid,
there
would
be
not
the
slightest
reason
for
having
that
remedy
run
for
a
period
in
excess
of
30
days.
because
with
respect
to
any
union
which
has
not
assisted
or
company-dominated,
there
is
the
power
legally
to
compel
the
payment
of
dues
once
the
30-day
period
has
passed.
so
in
all
these
cases,
if
the
collection
of
dues
were
the
truly
the
objective
of
this
refund
remedy,
the
refund
should
be
limited
to
a
30-day
period
that
the
employee
was
on
the
job.
mr.
bernard
dunau
six
months
preceding
the
filing
of
the
charge.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
now,
it
is
actually,
of
course,
untrue
that
the
refund
remedy
is
confined
to
situations
were
you
have
closed-shop
agreements.
the
preceding
case
illustrates
this
precisely.
in
the
preceding
case,
there
was
no
invalid
closed-shop
agreement.
there
was
a
hiring
hall
agreement.
there
was
a
separate
union
security
provision
which
required
the
payment
of
dues,
but
that
separate
union
security
provision
was
entirely
valid.
it
left
a
30-day
period.
and
in
fact
that
separate
union
security
provision
in
number
68
--
in
the
preceding
case,
could
not
have
compelled
the
payment
of
any
dues
because
what
the
board
in
that
case
requires
is
the
refund
of
dues
to
casual
employees.
they
never
work
a
period
of
30
days.
their
payment
to
dues
never
could
have
been
coerced
even
by
a
valid
union
security
agreement.
so,
it
is
utterly
inaccurate
to
say
that
the
remedy
is
designed
to
compel
the
return
of
dues
which
otherwise
would
not
had
been
paid.
we
are
told
that
virginia
electric
says,
"it
doesn't
matter
that
dues
were
not
coercively
paid:"
on
page
30
to
31
of
the
board's
brief,
there
is
a
quote
from
virginia
electric.
i
think
it
suffices
to
read
from
that
quote,
one
part
of
it,
on
page
30."
the
reimbursement
order
does
restore
to
the
employees
in
some
measure
what
was
taken
from
them
because
of
the
company's
unfair
labor
practices.
the
heart
of
the
vice
of
the
remedy
in
this
case
is
that
though
a
wrong
exists,
the
board
cannot
show
that
the
payment
of
dues
was
because
of
that
wrong.
in
the
absence
of
a
connection
between
the
wrong
and
the
payment
of
dues,
there
is
no
valid
basis
for
a
requirement
of
a
refund
of
dues."
