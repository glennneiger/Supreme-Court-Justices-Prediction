mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
board
is
a
remedy
for
a
hiring
arrangement
which
is
illegal.
either
because
it
requires
union
membership
as
a
condition
of
employment
as
in
number
68
here
or
because
it
leads
employees
to
believe
that
this
is
so
as
in
the
preceding
case.
they
order
that
the
parties
to
the
arrangement
not
only
cease
and
desist
from
giving
effect
toward
in
the
future,
but
also
to
refund
to
the
employees
dues
and
initiation
fees
paid
to
the
union
under
that
arrangement,
the
purpose
of
maintaining
or
acquiring
membership
in
good
standing.
it
is
the
board's
position
--
i
should
like
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
that
on
this
issue,
i
speak
only
for
the
board
and
not
for
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
norton
j.
come
not
for
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
you
could
infer
disagreements.
it
is
the
board's
position
that
this
reimbursement
remedy,
the
brown-olds
remedy,
is
an
allowable
exercise
of
the
power
conferred
on
the
board
by
section
10
(c)
of
the
act,
to
take
such
affirmative
action
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
back
pay
as
will
effectuate
the
policies
of
this
act.
now,
i
recognized
that
i
have
a
heavy
burden
to
sustain.
as
my
adversary
has
pointed
out,
the
question
in
the
posture
in
which
it
is
presented
in
the
two
cases
now
before
the
court,
namely,
where
the
employees
involved
where
union
members
before
being
subjected
to
the
illegal
arrangement,
has
been
considered
by
a
number
of
circuits
and
the
board's
position
has
been
rejected
except
in
two
instances.
one
is
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
this
case
and
the
first
circuit
as
indicated
that
it
would
not
reject
the
board's
position
in
the
said
posture
in
which
it
arises
in
this
case,
namely,
where
there
are
closed-shop
practices.
however,
the
other
circuits
which
have
considered
the
problem
have
rejected
the
board's
position.
i
shall,
nevertheless,
attempt
to
persuade
this
court
that
the
board
has
not
exceeded
the
limits
of
its
remedial
authority
for
the
reimbursement
remedy
was
devised
to
meet
and
it
has
been
successful
in
alleviating
a
serious
problem
in
the
administration
of
the
act.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think,
to
be
candid
with
you,
that
that
is
a
weaker
case
than
--
than
this
one,
but
i
think
that
the
principle
would
cover
both
cases.
mr.
norton
j.
come
had
we
got
the
charges
against
them.
mr.
norton
j.
come
all
that's
it
turned
out,
we
only
--
they're
actually
involved
in
that
case.
there
is
only
one
employer
and
the
union.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
--
it
could
--
it
could
be
in
--
in
their
issue.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
principle
that
i
am
arguing
for
would
sustain
it
in
--
in
that
situation.
however,
we
do
not
have
that
before
the
court
in
this
case
nor
do
we
actually
have
it
in
the
--
in
the
preceding
case.
in
this
case,
you
have
one
employer
and
one
union
and
you
have
concededly
closed-shop
practices.
i
should
like
to
concentrate
on
this
factual
situation
because
if
i
can't
make
out
here,
i
obviously
cannot
sustain
it
in
the
other
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
i
say,
there
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
number
68,
the
closed-shop
practice
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
involves
local
60
and
mechanical
handlers
who
were
engaged
in
putting
in
a
conveyer
system
for
the
ford
motor
company
and
they
used
millwrights
from
local
60.
and
they
are
the
ones
that
are
involved
in
this
thing
and
according
to
the
record,
the
job
lasted
about
a
sixth-month
period
and
there
were
some
25
millwrights
involved.
so
in
this
particular
case,
it's
a
relatively
small
amount
that
--
that
would
be
involved.
mr.
norton
j.
come
as
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that's
as
nearly
as
i
could
figure
out
what
it
would
amount
to
in
this
case.
assuming
that
the
assumption
that
there
were
that
many
employees
involved
in
--
on
petitioner's
premise
that
they
were
old-time
union
members,
who
had
already
paid
initiation
fees.
so
the
only
thing
would
be
involved
the
--
would
be
the
dues
payments
during
the
period
that
they
worked
on
the
job.
and
in
this
industry,
of
course,
they
probably
didn't
even
work
for
a
full
six
months.
i
mean,
the
nature
of
construction
projects
is
such
that
you
will
these
men
in
and
out,
they
don't
keep
--
keep
listed
in.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
that
is
correct
in
the
--
in
the
news
syndicate
case.
now,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
that
is
true
or
not.
but
we
won't
be
able
to
ascertain
that
until
we
get
to
--
to
compliance
proceeding.
i
--
it
--
it
may
be
theoretically
possible,
however,
that
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
company
and
the
union
preferred
to
take
the
chance
of
maintaining
what
the
board
found
to
be
a
closed-shop
contract.
that
they
cleaned
up
that
contract
at
anytime
within
the
moratorium
period
or
even
after
the
moratorium
period.
it
would
have
at
least
told
the
--
the
running
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that's
what
he
said
in
--
in
that
case,
but
i
would
like
to
--
like
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
the
international
typographical
union.
that
will
be
involved
in
the
next
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
answered
it
from
this
point
of
view
and
i
think
that
my
answer
is
still
correct,
namely,
that
--
assuming
that
there
had
been
no
cleaning
up
of
the
contract
within
a
moratorium
period,
there
is
nothing
that
the
board
could
do
about
any
particular
employer
or
--
or
union
arrangement,
unless
the
board
got
a
charge
filed
by
somebody
alleging
that
there
was
an
illegal
arrangement.
that
was
what
i
thought
you
would
have
in
--
in
mind.
and
that
would
still
hold
even
with
this
moratorium.
i
mean
we
couldn't
go
out
and
--
and
pick
up
any
arrangement
at
--
at
random,
whether
they
had
complied
or
not
complied.
we
have
to
have
a
charge
and
whether
you
do
or
not,
remains
problematically,
of
course,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
surely,
your
honor.
and
i'll
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
refund
remedy
is
different
from
applying
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i
realize
that
i
also
have
to
try
to
show
that
in
order
to
stay
on
my
feet
and
i
shall
try
to
do
so.
i
hope
you'll
pardon
me,
however,
if
i
defer
that,
though
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
--
i
wanted
to
say
that
the
reimbursement
remedy
was
devised
to
--
to
meet
and
has
been
successful
in
alleviating
what
has
been
a
serious
problem
in
the
administration
of
the
act.
the
board
found,
and
it
isn't
only
the
board,
there
have
been
numerous
impartial
students
in
this
field.
some
of
whom
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief,
that
that
covers
the
--
the
board's
conclusion.
that
10
years
after
congress
had
outlawed
the
closed-shop,
it
was
still
rampant
in
industries
of
short-term
employment
such
as
the
building
and
construction
industry,
where
the
union
controlled
the
hiring
process.
the
board
had
some
of
these
cases
that
imposed
cease
and
desist
orders.
and
they
were
just
not
affecting
the
situation
at
all.
you
had
closed-shop
practices
continuing
in
these
industries.
as
haber
and
levinson
pointed
out
in
their
study
in
1956,
which
is
set
forth
at
the
bottom
of
page
18
of
our
brief,
in
all
of
the
strongly
unionized
areas
studied
during
the
summer
of
1952,
employment
arrangements
equivalent
to
those
under
a
closed-shop
were
in
effect.
membership
in
the
union
was
almost
universally
regarded
as
a
prerequisite
for
obtaining
employment.
both
parties
viewed
this
as
standard
practice
and
showed
little
or
no
concern
for
the
illegality
of
the
arrangement.
petitioner
says
if
that
was
the
situation,
well
then
the
board
should
have
gone
to
congress.
the
board
felt,
however,
that
the
remedial
power
that
it
had
under
section
10
(c)
of
the
act,
which
as
i
have
indicated
to
your
honors,
empowers
it
to
provide
such
remedy
as
would
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act,
was
adequate
to
cover
the
problem.
whether
the
board
has
overstepped
the
bounds,
of
course,
is
the
question
that
we
have
in
this
case.
and
i
shall
try
to
demonstrate
that
we
have
stayed
under
remedial
side
of
the
line,
although
we
may
have
gotten
pretty
close
at
the
edge.
mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
concluded
yesterday,
i
was
--
i
had
finished
outlying
--
outlining
the
practical
problem
that
the
--
that
the
board
had
before
it,
which
prompted
it
to
device
the
brown-olds
refund
remedy.
the
practical
problem
being
that
despite
the
fact
that
congress
had
10
years
ago
outlawed
the
closed-shop,
those
practices
were
continuing
to
persist
in
industry's
short-term
employment
for
the
union
controlled
the
hiring
process,
such
as
in
industries
like
the
building
construction
industry
and
the
trucking
industry.
the
board
believes
that
such
a
remedy
is
authorized
by
section
10
(c)
of
the
act
and
by
the
holding,
although
concededly
the
facts
here
are
different,
by
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
virginia
electric
power
case,
sustaining
a
board
refund
remedy,
the
board's
power
to
order
refund
of
dues
and
fees.
the
majority
of
the
court
there,
in
sustaining
that
remedy,
enunciated
this
test,
namely,
that
such
a
remedy
should
stand
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
the
order
is
a
patent
attempt
to
achieve
ends
other
than
those
which
can
fairly
be
said
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
now,
i'm
going
to
try
to
show
if
i
can
that
this
refund
remedy
in
situation
such
as
we
have
in
--
in
these
cases
falls
within
that
test.
now,
one
of
the
declared
policies
of
the
act
is
to
protect
the
exercise
by
workers
of
full
freedom
of
association,
self-organization
and
this
policy
is
reflected
in
the
guarantee
of
this
right
in
section
7
of
the
act,
which
specifically
guarantees
these
rights
to
employees
and
adds
that
they
include
the
right
to
refrain
from
any
or
all
such
activities.
and
this
court
made
clear
in
the
radio
officers
case
that
one
of
the
corner
stones
of
the
section
7
right
to
refrain
from
assisting
the
union
was
the
right
to
get
a
job
without
having
to
be
a
union
member
or
in
full
conformity
with
union
policies.
now,
there
can
be
no
more
flagrant
impairment
of
this
freedom
and
the
type
of
practice
which
is
conceded
in
number
68,
the
closed-shop
practice.
the
board
found
and
the
court
below
agreed
that
mechanical
handlers,
the
employer
and
local
60
entered
into
an
agreement
whereby
the
company
would
obtain
all
their
millwrights
from
local
60
and
abide
by
its
rules
and
under
the
rules
of
the
union,
only
members
of
local
60
and
those
who
are
obtaining
work
permits
from
it,
could
get
a
job.
and
as
a
result,
two
employees
were
referred
--
were
denied
the
jobs
because
local
60
did
not
give
them
work
permits.
similarly,
the
hiring
arrangement
in
the
preceding
case,
under
the
board's
view
of
it,
likewise,
unlawfully
encourages
union
membership,
albeit
and
not
as
traumatic
or
fashion
as
a
closed-shop.
now,
a
refund
of
dues
and
fees
paid
to
the
union
by
employees
as
a
price
for
getting
jobs
under
these
illegal
hiring
arrangements,
in
the
board's
view,
vindicates
the
policies
of
the
act
which
have
been
negated
by
--
by
that
arrangement
for
this
reason.
the
question
is
why
has
the
union
been
willing
to
persist
in
maintaining
a
hiring
arrangement
such
as
we
have
in
local
68,
a
blatant
form
of
closed-shop
practice
that
is
clearly
outlawed
by
the
act.
the
reason,
it
is
fair
to
say,
is
because
it
assures
that
a
regular
flow
of
dues
and
fees
will
come
to
the
union.
it
maybe
that
these
employees
would
have
paid
anyhow,
but
the
union
certainly
has
not
been
willing
to
risk
that
chance
because
they
have
continued
to
maintain
the
closed-shop
practices
for
years
after
congress
outlawed
them
in
the
taft-hartley
amendments.
now,
a
refund
of
dues
and
fees,
in
the
board's
view,
removes
the
incentive
for
continuing
these
illegal
closed-shop
practices.
and
it
differs
from
a
jail
sentence
or
a
fine
in
that
it
is
commensurate
what
the
incentive
for
maintaining
the
illegal
arrangement.
it
is
not
some
figure
picked
at
--
picked
at
random,
it
is
measured
by
what
the
union
is
benefiting
as
a
result
of
continuing
these
closed-shop
practices.
this
court
said
in
the
virginia
electric
power
that
an
order
such
as
this,
of
course,
they
were
talking
about
a
different
set
of
facts,
which
deprives
an
employer
of
the
advantages
accruing
from
a
particular
method
of
subverting
the
act,
is
a
permissible
method
of
effectuating
the
statutory
policy.
we
think
that
a
refund
of
dues
and
fees
in
the
circumstances
that
we
have
here
does
no
more
than
that.
and
the
board
has
been
careful
to
restrict
the
refund
remedy
to
just
situations
where
it
would
have
the
effect
of
removing
the
incentive
for
violating
the
act
because
it
has
not
applied
this
remedy
in
situations
where
a
union
security
provision
has
been
illegal
for
only
technical
reasons
such
as
a
failure
to
comply
with
sections
9
(f),
(g)
and
(h)
or
where
employees
were
not
required
to
be
a
union
a
member
in
order
to
get
a
job,
but
instead
of
giving
them
30
days,
as
the
statute
requires,
they
were
given
only
29
days,
let's
say.
moreover,
the
board
has
not
applied
the
remedy
in
cases
where
the
parties
have
cleaned
up
their
agreements
during
the
moratorium
period
provided
by
the
general
counsel,
which
was
in
march
1st
to
november
1st,
1958,
as
a
recent
case.
it
makes
that
clear,
which
i
do
not
think
is
cited
in
our
brief,
namely,
booth
&
flinn
company,
129
nlrb,
number
89.
now,
we
believe
that
if
we
have
shown
that
the
refund
order
meets
the
test
in
virginia
electric
power,
the
fact
that
it
was
devised
as
a
more
effective
means
of
deterring
illegal
hiring
arrangements,
does
not
impair
its
validity.
we
think
that
purpose
of
a
--
of
a
refund
--
of
a
--
of
a
board
remedy,
if
otherwise,
appropriate,
is
a
measure
of
--
of
deterrence
under
the
--
for
the
board
to
look
around
to
modify
its
--
its
remedies
in
order
to
--
to
make
them
more
effective,
is
not
in
its
itself
--
does
not
in
itself,
make
the
remedy
invalid.
we
think
that
the
seven-up
case
before
this
court
indicates
that.
this
court
will
recall,
that
was
a
situation
where
the
board
found
that
as
a
result
of
computing
back
pay
over
the
entire
period
between
discharge
and
offer
of
reinstatement,
it
found
that
the
employers
were
tending
to
delay
offers
of
reinstatement
and
the
hope
that
the
employee
would
get
a
better
paying
job
and
thus,
reduce
its
back
pay
liability.
as
a
result
of
its
experience,
whit
this
situation,
the
board
found
that
it
would
have
to
take
a
step
in
order
to
make
the
--
the
reinstatement
remedy
more
effective.
that
it
was
not
having
its
full
effect
and
therefore,
it
devised
the
procedure
of
computing
back
pay
on
a
quarterly
basis.
and
this
court
sustained
that,
though
in
some
cases,
it
might
have
resulted
in
an
employee
being
made
more
than
whole
or
putting
in
another
way,
and
the
employer
having
to
pay
more
back
pay
than
he
would
had
to
pay
had
the
employee
remained
on
the
job.
it
was
sustained
because
that
modification
in
the
remedy
was
reasonably
related
to
effectuating
the
statutory
policy
which
was
to
ensure
that
employees
that
had
been
unfairly
discharged
would
be
promptly
reinstated.
now,
the
big
argument
that
--
that
petitioner
advances
is
that
we
cannot
show
that
the
dues
were
coerced
here.
these
are
union
members
longstanding
--
belong
to
the
union
before
they
were
subjected
to
this
particular
unlawful
hiring
arrangement.
and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
wouldn't
have
continued
to
pay
dues
even
without
the
arrangement.
well,
that
maybe
so,
although
one
wonders
is
that,
if
that
is
so
sure,
why,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
unions,
particularly
in
the
building
trades,
would
continue
to
take
no
chances
and
persist
in
their
closed-shop
practices.
my
opponent
pointed
out
that
the
building
trades
industries
are
very
highly
unionized
industry.
that's
very
true.
it
also
has
been
the
leading
practitioner
of
the
closed-shop.
and
it
has
continued
to
engage
in
those
practices
long
after
congress
outlawed
them.
and
congress
in
8
(f),
i
might
point
out,
although
it
did
permit
the
building
trades
unions
to
enter
into
pre-hire
contracts,
it
did
not
give
them
the
closed-shop.
it
limited
them
to
a
union
shop
and
although
it
cut
down
the
time
from
the
30
days
to
7,
it
still
did
not
authorize
or
sanction,
even
in
that
industry,
a
closed-shop.
but
beyond
that,
we
submit
that
a
showing
of
--
of
coercion
is
not
necessary
to
sustain
the
refund
remedy
as
we
read
virginia
electric
power.
indeed,
as
we
read
it,
we
think
that
was
the
issue
which
divided
the
court
in
that
case.
as
this
court
may
recall,
there
were
three
sets
of
opinions
in
virginia
electric
power.
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
three
dissenters
who
did
not
sustain
the
refund
remedy
on
the
ground
that
was
no
showing,
no
proof
that
the
employees
were
actually
coerced
in
the
payment
of
dues.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
a
separate
opinion
concurring
with
the
majority
of
the
court
sustaining
a
refund
remedy.
he
did
so
on
the
ground
that
he
agreed
that
coercion
had
to
be
shown
but
that
sufficient
coercion
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
closed-shop
contract
in
that
case,
which
required
the
employees
to
join
the
union.
they
had
no
choice
about
whether
they
wanted
to
join
or
not.
the
remaining
five
members
of
the
court,
however,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
murphy,
sustained
the
refund
remedy
on
the
ground
under
--
under
the
test
that
i
enunciated
earlier.
they
did
not
rest
the
holding,
as
we
read
it,
upon
a
showing
or
requirement
that
you
show
that
the
dues
were
actually
exacted
under
coercion.
now,
i
should
like
to
say
a
word
about
petitioner's
reading
of
the
virginia
electric
to
limited
--
limit
it
to
a
company-dominated
union
situation.
it
is
true
that
the
--
that
the
union
in
virginia
electric
was
company-dominated.
since
the
closed-shop,
however,
was
legal
under
the
wagner
act,
you
had
to
have
something
more
than
the
closed-shop
to
give
the
board
any
predicate
for
finding
an
unfair
labor
practice.
company
domination
was
the
particular
predicate
in
virginia
electric
power.
the
courts,
however,
have
not
viewed
virginia
electric
as
limited
to
the
company-dominated
union
situation.
we
have
had
refund
orders
sustained
by
many
of
the
same
courts,
which
have
not
sustained
them
in
this
particular
case,
in
situations
where
you
had
nothing
more
than
a
grant
of
recognition
to
a
minority
union
with
a
union
security
clause
and
the
unions
were
--
such
unions
as
the
teamsters
and
the
machinists,
which
were
not
in
the
company-dominated
union
character,
our
pledge.
we
have
set
forth
those
decisions
in
our
--
in
our
brief
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
particularly
to
the
revere
metal
art
case,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
33
of
our
brief.
i
could
take
the
court's
time
for
a
moment
to
just
read
a
moment
briefly
from
that
case.
the
court
in
sustaining
the
refund
order
in
that
situation,
which
was
a
minority
union
which
had
been
granted
exclusive
recognition
in
the
union's
security
clause,
sustaining
the
refund
of
dues
there,
even
though
there
had
been
no
proof
that
the
employees
had
--
had
paid
the
dues
under
coercion.
the
second
circuit
in
an
opinion
by
judge
friendly
said,
"for
the
courts
to
require
a
determination
of
the
attitude
of
each
employee
in
every
case
would
impose
impossible
administrative
divergence."
"we've
been
admonished
that
although
orders
requiring
reimbursement
to
employees
for
dues
paid
to
unions
unlawfully
forced
upon
them,
both
somewhat
resemble
compensation
for
private
injury,
we
must
not
consider
them
solely
in
that
light
seems
they
vindicate
public
not
private
rights,"
quoting
from
virginia
electric
power.
the
fact
the
union
imposed
in
virginia
electric
was
company-dominated,
does
not
appear
to
be
a
valid
distinction
here.
now,
to
be
sure,
the
facts
even
in
these
cases
that
i'm
referring
to
where
a
refund
order
has
been
de-sustained,
even
though
there
has
been
no
company
domination,
differ
from
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
because
they
did
not
involve
old-time
union
members
in
an
inference
of
coercion
as
possible
from
the
--
form
the
union
security
clause.
i
think
they
illustrate,
however,
that
virginia
electric
power
cannot
be
put
to
one
side,
simply
on
the
ground
that
it
involved
a
company-dominated
union.
i
think
that
they
indicate
that
there
is
more
to
virginia
electric
in
this
factor
and
that
the
decisive
consideration
that
virginia
electric
leaves
you
with
is
the
test
that
i
alluded
to
at
the
outset,
namely,
whether
or
not,
the
refund
order
can
be
shown
to
be
a
patent
attempt
to
achieve
ends
other
than
those
which
can
fairly
be
said
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
and
i
have
tried
to
--
to
indicate
why
the
board
believes
that
a
refund
order
in
the
circumstances
here
satisfies
that
test
and
fall
short
of
a
penalty,
a
jail
sentence
or
an
arbitrary
fine.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
one
more
citation,
if
i
may,
which
i
find
is
not
in
our
brief.
yesterday,
mr.
justice
black
asked
for
decisions
in
which
the
board's
rationale
in
mountain
pacific
had
been
set
forth.
now,
of
course,
there
is
the
mountain
pacific
case
itself
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
i
find
it
there
has
--
is
some
discussion
of
the
basis
for
the
safeguards
at
123
n.l.r.b.
at
page
1887.
unfortunately,
that
case
was
not
cited
in
our
brief,
it
is
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
--
of
board
member
jenkins
in
one
of
these
mountain
pacific
cases,
which
sets
forth,
i
think,
better
than
our
brief
does,
the
rationale
for
the
safeguards.
i
would
like
to
call
that
to
the
court's
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
is
a
case
called
the
boilermakers
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
boilermakers
case.
that
is
123
n.l.r.b.
at
1887.
thank
you.
