mr.
dunau.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
come.
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
for
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
come,
before
you
get
in
to
that,
may
i
ask
you,
if
under
your
theory,
the
--
the
board
would've
had
the
power
in
the
cases
that
have
just
been
argued
prior
to
this
one
to
do
the
same
thing
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
of
the
illegal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
in
that
case
because
there
were
a
thousand
employers
that
were
--
were
a
party
to
this
hiring
hall
agreement,
they
could
have
required
all
the
--
the
union
dues
of
that
entire
thousand
to
--
to
turn
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
you
found
--
you
found
that
the
entire
thing
was
wrong
that
all
the
--
all
the
procedures
that
all
the
thousand
employers
had
engaged
in
were
really
--
didn't
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
wouldn't
the
same
--
couldn't
the
same
sanctions
be
applied
to
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
think
that's
clearly
given
to
the
--
that
power
is
clearly
given
to
the
labor
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
told
me
in
the
--
in
the
prior
case,
mr.
come,
that
there
was
no
administrative
procedure
that
could
be
used
to
--
to
bring
this
mountain
or
pacific
mountain
doctrine
to
bear
on
everybody
in
the
industry.
and
you
say
in
this
case
that
the
general
counsel
merely
told
these
people
that
if
you
don't
do
it
by
such
and
such
a
time,
we're
going
to
do
so
and
so
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
--
you
call
that
--
you,
yourself,
call
that
a
moratorium.
i'd
--
i
was
thinking
of
something
like
that
when
i
asked
you
the
question.
did
you
--
did
you
--
did
the
board
apply
any
such
pressure
to
--
to
the
industries
that
used
the
hiring
hall
in
those
other
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
could
i
ask
you
one
more
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
i
hope
not
to
bother
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
instead
of
--
of
requiring
the
payment
of
these
dues
just
assessed
the
fine
against
--
against
the
union
and
a
fine
against
the
employer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
would
like
to
get
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
you
don't
--
take
your
time
in
your
own
--
we
don't
have
reach
that
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

your
