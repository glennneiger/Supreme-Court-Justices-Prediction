been
the
judges

be
bound
to
sign
in
against
the
union
simply
because
the
conflicted
values,

would
it?
justice

have
you
to
say
upon

of
whether

would
be
effective
to
eliminate
that
evil?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
don't
you

pay
for?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
do
not
think
it
should
be
done
by
a
slap
on
the
wrist?
do
you
think
the

kind
which
you
relate
to
eliminate
this
type
of
a
reason
that
it
took
to
eliminate
the
reason
of
company
unions?

some
place
in
the
brief,
i
recall,
seeing
figure
of
$525,
is
that
right?
