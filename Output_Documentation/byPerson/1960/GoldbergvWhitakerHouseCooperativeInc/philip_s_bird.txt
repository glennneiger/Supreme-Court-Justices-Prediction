mr.
philip
s.
bird
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
well
four
years
ago
at
this
time,
i
started
receiving
several
letters
from
many
of
the
prospective
members
of
what
is
now
known
as
whitaker
house
cooperative
and
each
one
of
them
invariably
asked
why
doesn't
the
government
let
us
alone
and
let
us
take
care
of
ourselves?
isn't
there
something
that
could
be
done,
because
they
had
heard
that
mrs.
whitaker
had
been
requested
to
--
go
out
of
business
by
the
department
of
labor.
well,
i
had
contacted
the
labor
department
for
mrs.
whitaker.
i
received
the
letter
from
them
and
after
reading
it
and
looking
at
some
of
the
references
cited
by
the
attorney
for
the
regional
office,
i
advised
her
that
she
had
best
fold
her
doors
and
find
some
other
way
of
making
a
livelihood.
at
short
time
after
she
went
out
of
business
and
it
was
about
this
time
of
the
year,
where
these
letters
started
coming
in
and
i
wondered
about
them
a
little
bit,
but
i
didn't
feel
there's
anything
that
i
could
do
about
it.
then
one
day,
a
regional
investigator
from
the
department
of
labor,
who
had
been
investigated
for
a
long
time,
ever
since
the
(inaudible)
into
effect,
called
at
my
office
and
he
was
--
had
to
be
in
town
and
we've
talked
the
thing
over
a
little
bit.
and
he
said,
have
you
ever
start
--
thought
of
starting
a
cooperative?
now
i
said,
well,
i
had
orders
in
reading
the
palmer
case
to
at
least
by
innuendo
of
the
court
in
the
first
circuit,
there
was
a
possibility
that
a
true
cooperative
might
comply
with
the
law.
and
i
didn't
know
a
thing
about
cooperative,
so
i
sent
for
a
book
which
was
cited
in
the
palmer
case
as
being
authoritative
on
the
subject
of
cooperatives.
after
getting
the
book
which
is
law
of
cooperatives,
third
edition
by
israel
packel,
i
read
through
it
and
decided
that
perhaps
this
was
a
possibility.
i'm
not
evading
the
law,
but
avoiding
the
law
and
i
so
informed
many
of
the
women
who
had
written
to
me.
some
of
the
women
came
to
my
office,
one
of
the
discussions
had,
after
these
discussions
why
a
letter
was
sent
out
which
was
cited
in
the
file
record
dated
i
believe
june
28,
following
a
meeting
of
those
who
were
interested
in
forming
some
way
of
--
a
business
of
--
some
sort
of
business
that
might
allow
them
to
continue
in
this
skill
craft
f
theirs.
mr.
philip
s.
bird
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
philip
s.
bird
the
minimum
--
we
were
seeking
to
comply
with
the
law
in
respect
that
admittedly,
we
knew
that
these
women
and
the
women
knew
it
themselves,
could
not
pay
themselves
$1
an
hour
minimum
and
they
could
not
comply
with
the
minimum
wage
an
hour
requirements
for
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
philip
s.
bird
law
that
admitted
--
mr.
philip
s.
bird
right.
in
addition
to
this,
we
had
hoped
and
as
it
is
outlined
in
the
letter,
we
hoped
that
the
institution
of
the
cooperative
would
provide
some
other
benefits
to
them.
the
cooperative
--
the
women
who
initiated
the
cooperative
met
as
described
by
the
counsel
for
the
appellant.
the
articles
of
incorporation
were
presented
to
them
in
the
usual
form
provided
by
this
statutory
procedure.
the
bylaws
were
presented,
prepared
not
by
me,
but
mr.
packel.
and
if
you
will
--
have
opportunity
to
compare
the
bylaws
that
are
in
this
book
with
the
actual
bylaws
that
were
printed
and
sent
out
all
the
members
eventually,
you
would
say
that
they
are
almost
identical
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
decision
of
the
district
court
who
said
also
that
they
were
copied
from
the
forms
set
forth
in
mr.
packel's
book.
mr.
philip
s.
bird
i
wasn't
employed
by
the
women.
they
--
they
sent
a
small
amounts
of
money
in
--
to
me
from
all
over
the
state.
mrs.
whitaker
never
paid
me
a
cent
for
this
work.
the
cooperative
then
proceeded
to
organize
and
they
determined
that
the
best
name
that
they
could
think
of
to
use
was
the
name
whitaker
house.
i
advised
them
against
this
because
i
anticipated
that
there
might
be
some
relationship
made
that
for
later
time
by
the
department
of
labor
with
mrs.
whitaker
and
--
and
it
was
that's
what
has
happened.
they
straight
through
from
the
very
beginning,
the
department
of
labor
has
tried
--
tried
to
equate
this
organization
with
the
ones
described
in
the
palmer
case
and
in
â€“
(inaudible)
case.
after
the
interrogatories
were
filed
by
the
government
and
responses
given
thereto,
a
two-day
hearing
was
held
before
the
lower
court.
by
the
way,
the
lower
court
had
just
about
three
months
prior
to
this
time
had
another
case
which
is
set
forth
in
mitchell
versus
(inaudible)
which
is
cited
in
both
in
the
appellant's
brief
in
which
he
had
gone
into
the
law
involved
in
this
type
of
litigation
very
extensively.
and
when
he
first
confronted
--
was
confronted
with
this
case,
he
said,
isn't
this
just
another
case
all
over
again?
i
said,
i
beg
to
differ
with
you,
your
honor.
i
think
you'll
find
it's
considerably
different
and
he
did
so
find
that
it
was
considerably
different.
he
found
that
this
was
a
true
cooperative
and
i
don't
want
to
go
into
the
arguments
today
on
the
evidence.
i
think
that
the
courts
below
had
found
the
facts
fairly.
what
i
do
want
to
address
my
remarks
to
the
court
of
is
that
this
very
important
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
a
member,
owner,
producers
of
a
true
cooperative
are
employees
subject
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
and
as
i
was
interesting
--
it
was
interesting
to
me
yesterday
in
listening
to
the
argument
in
the
ascap
case
to
wonder
if
there
isn't
some
analogy
in
that
case
with
ours.
there,
you
have
association
of
6400
people
and
incorporated
to
be
sure,
but
the
fact
of
incorporation
should
not
i
feel,
has
any
bearing
on
the
decision
in
this
case.
whether
it's
a
group,
an
association
or
a
corporation,
i
feel
should
not
have
any
relevance
whatsoever
in
the
final
outcome
of
this
hearing.
what
would
happen
in
the
ascap
case,
for
example
if
the
department
of
labor
should
institute
an
action
against
ascap
or
a
certain
segment
of
their
membership,
because
they
control
all
the
other
composers
and
publishers
or
control
all
of
the
composers?
i
think
we
can
pretty
well
agree
that
there
would
have
a
difficult
time
sustaining
an
employment
relationship
there.
i
think
in
considering
for
this
case,
we
have
to
start
with
some
pretty
fundamental
basic
premises.
one
is
--
i
always
thought
it
was
to
any
rank
that
an
individual
has
a
right
to
make
things
or
to
act
in
a
productive
way
whether
it's
creatively
making
something
in
the
way
of
art
or
making
something
intangible
in
the
way
of
music
or
something
tangible
as
in
this
case.
he
has
a
right
to
make
them.
he
has
the
right
to
dispose
of
them
in
the
ordinary
channels
of
commerce
in
the
best
way
that
he
possibly
can.
secondly,
i
think
we
must
agree
that
two
or
more
of
these
--
of
these
individuals
have
a
right
to
get
together
and
pull
their
efforts
in
this
direction
and
save
--
thus
saving
themselves
on
cost,
in
order
to
sell
their
products
of
their
work
for
the
best
advantage
and
in
interstate
commerce,
without
their
having
to
pay
themselves
$1
an
hour
for
their
labor
and
of
course,
both
courts
below
seemed
to
be
of
the
similar
opinion.
where
then
does
the
department
of
labor
propose
to
draw
a
line
which
will
say
x
number
of
people
can
do
this,
but
x
plus
one
can't
do
this?
we
here,
are
considering
an
employment
relationship.
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
as
propounded
by
the
congress
and
as
illustrated
by
the
decision
below.
there
is
no
language
in
the
act
which
proposes
to
include
all
types
of
activities.
it
proposes
to
include
all
types
of
employment,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
every
person
engaged
in
productive
work
is
going
to
be
subject
to
the
act.
many
illustrations
can
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
--
a
court
that
a
number
of
people
that
do
choose
to
work.
it's
amazing
to
some
people
i
realized
what
they
do
choose
to
work
for
less
than
$1
an
hour.
if
they
obtained
some
satisfaction
from
it,
that's
for
them
to
decide.
the
decision
of
the
court
below
is
submitted
contrary
to
the
argument
of
the
appellant,
do
nothing
to
alter,
effect
or
change
any
of
the
previous
rulings
of
this
court.
they
do
nothing
to
alter
or
change
any
of
the
prior
rulings
of
the
circuit
courts
who
have
been
called
upon
to
apply
this
section.
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
a
true
cooperative
has
come
to
the
attention
of
any
court
as
far
as
--
as
my
knowledge
is
concerned
under
this
particular
act.
when
we
look
at
the
decisions
below,
i
think
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
circuit
court
here
involved,
is
the
very
one
who
handed
down
the
decision
upon
which
the
appellant
relies
in
their
appeal,
namely
the
palmer
case.
and
of
course,
consistent
and
right
straight
along,
the
appellant
has
endeavored
to
equate
all
the
facts
of
this
case
with
the
palmer
case
and
it
just
doesn't
fit.
i
made
a
diagram
in
my
brief.
there
is
a
whole
list
of
different
--
differences
beginning
from
the
very
institution
of
the
cooperative.
in
the
palmer
case,
you
have
an
obvious
creation
of
cooperative
from
the
top
down
with
everything
done
to
guarantee
that
the
palmer
management
would
retain
and
maintain
the
control
and
operation
of
a
cooperative.
that
just
isn't
so
here.
the
bylaws
have
specifically
provided
that
the
membership
shall
have
--
each
individual
in
the
cooperative
shall
an
equal
vote
with
every
other
individual
and
that
no
one
is
in
the
position
to
obtain
superior
control
over
the
entire
operation.
i
don't
think
that
the
appellant
can
persuade
the
court
now,
after
two
prior
determinations
on
the
facts
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
bona
fide
cooperative.
we
have
a
bona
fide
cooperative
and
it
seems
to
me
the
important
consideration
here
is
whether
or
not,
the
member
producers,
owners
of
such
an
organization,
come
within
the
act.
now,
another
case
which
the
appellant
relies
on
pretty
heavily
in
their
brief
is
the
farmers
irrigation
case
and
which
employees
--
admitted
employees
of
a
--
an
agricultural
ditch
cooperative
so
to
speak,
were
held
to
come
within
the
act.
not
--
the
issue
there
was
not
whether
or
not
they're
employees,
but
whether
or
not
these
employees
were
agricultural
employees
or
employees
engaged
in
collection
in
the
normal
channels
of
interstate
commerce.
the
important
thing
to
remember
here
is
that
they
were
not
dealing
with
the
farmers
themselves
who
were
the
owners
of
the
cooperative.
let's
try
and
picture
the
situation
a
little
differently
in
the
farmers
irrigation
case
if
we
may.
let's
say
the
farmers
did
all
the
work
themselves
on
a
cooperative
basis,
on
these
ditches
and
that
they
did
not
hire
any
employees
to
do
the
work.
they
did
it
all
themselves
and
then
shared
in
the
--
the
proceeds
of
the
service
that
they
were
earning
to
themselves.
would
we
not
then
have
a
different
result
granting
for
the
moment
that
they
would
be
included
as
â€“
exempt
as
agricultural
employees,
if
we
disregard
that
and
just
take
on
the
basis
of
a
comparable
relationship.
they
certainly
would
not
be
--
construed
to
be
employees
of
their
own
organization.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
now
a
--
another
illustration
of
an
attempt
by
the
governmental
agency
to
stretch
the
application
of
the
act
beyond
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
its
original
intent.
the
court
below
and
the
district
court
specifically
requested
that
all
of
the
hearing
that
were
published
in
this
matter
be
sent
to
it
--
submitted
to
it
for
the
consideration
prior
to
the
decision,
this
was
done.
and
i'm
sure
that
many
of
you
have
personal
knowledge
of
these
hearings
yourself.
i
for
one
have
been
unable
in
all
of
the
records,
to
find
a
single
instance
where
it
has
said
that
a
member,
farmer,
producer
of
a
cooperative
shall
be
within
the
act.
the
only
time
that
this
is
mentioned
is
when
they're
talking
about
the
employees
of
cooperatives.
they
always
talk
in
terms
of
an
assumed
employment
relationship.
they
never
talk
in
terms
of
the
member
owners
of
the
cooperative
being
subject
to
the
act.
in
the
various
bills
that
have
been
introduced
in
congress
to
exempt,
say
dairying
cooperative
employees
because
they
try
to
liken
them
to
being
agricultural
employees,
they
are
always
talking
about
admitted
employees.
they're
talking
about
exempting
admitted
employees.
they're
not
talking
about
exempting
the
owner
of
the
dairy
or
the
group
of
people
who
own
the
dairy.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
a
cooperative
organization
is
a
one
way,
remaining
open
to
individuals
in
our
country
for
providing
a
form
of
industrial
democracy.
it
has
been
a
pleasure
to
work
with
these
women
in
this
case,
in
this
case
of
--
it's
been
a
pleasure
to
watch
them
learn
some
of
the
things
that
go
into
conducting
a
business.
it
hasn't
been
easy
for
them.
it
hasn't
been
easy
for
anyone,
but
they
are
learning
--
they
are
willing
to
assume
the
risk.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they've
made
several
changes
since
the
day
of
the
trial.
this
is
not
before
you
and
not
proper
that
it
should
be
of
course,
but
they
are
anxious
to
continue
their
--
their
business
and
they
are
anxious
to
improve
upon
it.
they
are
willing
if
necessary,
to
accept
losses
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
better
marketing
facilities
in
the
urban
areas
of
the
country.
this
organization
was
setup
to
help
them,
help
themselves.
it
was
not
setup
to
enable
them
to
serve
the
cooperative.
judge
--
judge
aldrich
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
i
think
misstates
the
question.
with
all
due
respect
to
the
judge,
i
think
he
might
more
properly
have
stated
the
question
(inaudible)
in
regard
to
union
membership.
if
a
union
should
become
an
owner
of
the
plant
where
the
members
are
working,
such
as
in
the
(inaudible)
manufacturing
case,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
as
an
example
of
a
partnership
which
was
held
not
to
be
within
the
act.
if
a
union
should
become
an
owner
of
the
business
and
if
each
union
member
had
an
equal
vote
in
the
operation
of
the
business
and
if
each
union
member
should
share
in
the
profits
of
the
business
according
to
the
time
that
he
put
into
it,
what
difference
is
there
between
that
and
a
partnership
or
a
cooperative
that
we
have
here
and
where
is
the
employment
relationship?
how
can
a
man
employ
himself
or
how
can
a
group
of
individuals
in
this
situation
employ
themselves?
i'm
directing
my
concluding
remarks
to
judge
aldrich's
second
question.
i
believe
he
states
that,
"a
stockholder
who
is
also
an
employee
obviously,
is
not
exempt
just
because
he
becomes
the
stockholder
admittedly,"
but
there
are
two
different
relationships
here.
the
stockholder's
interest
is
obtaining
a
return
on
his
capital
investment
and
employee's
objective
is
getting
his
return
on
his
labor.
if
you
merge
those
into
one,
so
that
the
interest
of
the
labor
is
identical
with
his
interest
as
a
stockholder
as
in
a
cooperative,
then
he
ceases
to
be
an
employee
and
becomes
an
employer.
he
becomes
a
self-employed
person.
i
think
it
is
too
late
in
the
game
now
for
the
appellant
to
seriously
contend
that
the
cooperative
is
not
a
bona
fide
organization.
it's
also
quite
obvious
that
their
contentions
as
far
as
the
--
the
law
is
concerned,
do
not
hold
too
much
weight.
they
cannot
claim
a
single
reference
which
specifically
says
that
these
people
are
not
to
be
included
and
are
to
be
included
within
the
law.
they
cannot
produce
a
single
citation
which
says
that
they
are
to
be
included
and
if
the
language
of
the
act
does
not
include
them,
then
certainly
they
should
not
be
allowed
by
administrative
legislation
to
so
include
them.
thank
you
very
much.
