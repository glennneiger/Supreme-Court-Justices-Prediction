mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
for
the
second
monday
in
a
row,
this
court
is
faced
with
a
difficult
question
on
the
interrelationship
of
the
accrual
accounting
and
the
federal
income
tax.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but,
it
was
last
monday
mr.
justice
douglas
that
this
court
considered
the
american
automobile
association
case.
and
i
was
trying
to
recall
to
the
court
that
some
of
the
matters
which
are
relevant
here
will
be
considered
just
one
week
ago.
at
17
years
ago,
this
court
in
the
dixie
pine
products
case
and
in
the
security
flour
mills
case
laid
a
rule
which
was
--
which
has
been
universally
followed
to
the
effect
that
when
the
taxpayer
contest
a
tax
which
is
deductible
for
federal
income
tax
purpose
and
does
not
pay
that
tax.
that
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
principles
of
accrual
accounting
in
our
federal
income
tax
law
to
permit
him
to
deduct
that
tax.
the
question
today
is
in
a
sense
of
refinement
to
that
question.
what
is
the
rule
to
be
followed
where
the
taxpayer
pays
the
tax?
perhaps,
under
--
as
in
this
case,
under
violent
protest
but
nonetheless
pays
the
tax,
but
then
--
and
then
goes
on
to
contest
in
the
appropriate
forum
his
liability
for
that
tax.
position
which
the
government
is
urging
is
that
payment
is
a
very
important
matter,
one
that
is
not
made
likely
in
the
business
world.
and
that
ones
payment
is
made,
the
position
of
the
parties
has
changed
considerably.
that
change
should
be
reflected
in
the
tax
accounting.
in
this
case,
the
respondent
has
been
described
by
the
second
circuit
as
a
well-known
public
utility.
it
has
large
real
estate
holdings
in
new
york
city.
for
the
years
1946
through
1950,
the
respondent
contested
the
liability
alleged
to
be
owing
one
hundredths
of
parcels
of
real
estate
which
he
owned.
the
settlement
for
all
five
of
these
years,
which
reached
in
1951,
this
case
presents
to
the
court
the
question
of
the
tax
treatment
for
1951.
however,
if
this
court
will
determine
what
was
the
appropriate
accounting
at
the
end
of
the
tax
year
in
question
all
of
the
other
questions
ini
the
case
were
fall
into
place.
now,
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
a
stipulated
example
which
is
printed
in
perfusion.
it's
in
the
record
page
5,
petitioner's
brief
page
5,
respondent's
brief
page
7.
this
example
has
--
has
been
agreed
by
all
parties
and
by
all
the
courts
which
have
considered
this
matter
to
be
one
which
brings
out
with
full
clarity
the
true
issues
in
the
case.
the
stipulated
example
takes
the
year
1949,
but
this
would
--
the
same
thing
would
be
true
as
to
any
of
the
other
years
of
the
tax
years
in
question.
on
january
25,
the
respondent
would
receive
a
notice
from
the
city
tax
commission
that
he
owed
in
respect
of
certain
property
a
tax
of
$100.
within
a
short
period
thereafter,
the
respondent
was
required
to
file
what
amounted
to
a
--
a
protest.
and
in
this
protest,
which
is
admittedly
a
bona
fide
protest
of
the
tax
liability.
the
respondent
would
admit
that
on
his
estimated
value,
a
true
tax
would
be
$85.
but,
respondent
denied
any
liability
in
excess
of
that.
now,
in
terms
of
the
stipulated
example,
it's
assumed
that
this
administrative
protest
was
unsuccessful
which
at
by
and
large
was.
then
in
--
on
may
25,
the
$400
tax
was
assessed
by
the
appropriate
authority.
then,
october
1st,
was
the
payment
dates
for
the
taxes.
on
that
date,
responded
paid
the
$400.
now,
he
did
this
under
a
violent
protest
and
for
the
stated
purpose
of
avoiding
levy,
seizure,
penalties,
interest
and
all
of
the
problems
that
come
to
people
who
don't
pay
taxes.
and
i
want
to
be
very
careful
that
nothing
i
say
later
in
this
argument
would
give
any
indication
that
the
government
contest
that
this
respondent
was
acting
in
anything
other
than
good
faith
in
making
that
type
of
protest
and
that
the
reasons
for
making
their
payment
are
as
stipulated.
then
on
october
25,
the
respondent
would
commence
in
the
new
york
supreme
court
certiorari
proceedings.
and
in
these
certiorari
proceedings,
it
would
admit
as
it
did
earlier
liability
for
$85
of
the
tax.
it
would
deny
liability
for
the
rest.but
since
it
had
paid
the
money,
the
obvious
relief
sought
was
it
would
be
refunded
the
$15
which
it
had
paid
as
tax.
now,
those
are
all
of
the
events
which
happened
in
the
tax
year.
looking
at
the
books
of
the
company,
at
the
end
of
--
in
this
case,
1949,
what
is
the
appropriate
accounting
treatment?
well
though,
as
i
see
it,
there
would
be
three
ways
that
this
could
be
done.
perhaps,
the
soundest
in
the
long
run
would
be
to
say,
"well,
this
is
such
a
contest.
we'd
just
have
to
hold
the
books
open
and
see
how
things
come
out."
this
would
be
the
most
accurate.
but
nobody
in
this
court
urges
that
approach.
this
was
foreclosed
by
a
number
of
decisions
of
the
court
perhaps
burnet
versus
sanford
&
brooks
would
be
as
good
an
example
as
any.
but
the
income
tax
rule
requires
that
we
do
make
an
annual
estimate
if
you
wish,
or
the
best
--
based
on
the
best
information
possible,
an
annual
determination
of
the
income,
so
that
no
one
beliefs
that
you
can
accurately
reflect
everything
that
happened
in
the
year
1949.
now,
the
second
possibility
would
be
to
say
that
the
payment
of
$100
was
a
payment
of
tax
and
accrue
the
entire
amount.
and
say
that
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
contingency
is
whether
the
taxpayer
will
get
a
refund
of
the
$100.
that
is
what
we
don't
know.
we
do
know
that
he's
paid
$100.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
excuse
me,
a
refund
of
a
maximum
of
$15.
now,
this
is
the
position
which
the
commissioner
advised
respondent
to
take
a
published
and
announced
ruling
on
this.
it's
the
method
which
was
followed
in
taxpayer's
books,
it's
a
method
that
the
government
is
urging
in
this
case,
it's
a
method
which
the
court
of
claims
has
decided
should
be
followed,
it
was
a
method
to
the
district
court
accepted
here.
the
second
circuit
held
for
the
third
possibility,
which
i'll
now
discuss.
the
third
possibility
would
be
to
say
that
the
dixie
pine
products
and
security
flour
mills
cases
say
that
whenever
taxes
is
--
is
in
dispute,
we
will
never,
under
any
circumstance,
record
an
amount
until
that
dispute
is
settled.
and
under
these
principles,
he
would
in
the
tax
year
accrue
an
expense
of
$85
and
in
effect
hold
the
$15
in
suspense
until
the
litigation
was
terminated.
this
is
the
view
which
the
second
circuit
adopted.
now,
i
stop
short
of
the
last
step
of
the
stipulated
example
because
i
wish
to
focus
the
attention
of
the
court
on
the
end
of
tax
year.
in
fact,
in
1951
under
the
stipulated
example,
there
was
a
determination
of
this
litigation.
the
tax
liability
was
found
to
be
$95.
this
meant
that
the
taxpayer
had
overpaid
his
taxes
$5.
but
it
also
meant
that
the
taxpayer
owed
the
remaining
$10
out
of
the
15.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
right.
he
had
already
paid
that
amount.
but,
in
effect,
the
--
if
the
item
was
in
suspense
under
some
method
of
accounting,
it
was
supposing
at
that
time
as
being
forever
applied
to
the
tax
liability,
there
was
no
further
litigation
possible.
now,
in
the
refund
suit
in
this
case,
the
taxpayer
said
that
the
method
it
followed
in
this
returns
in
the
tax
years
was
incorrect.
it
should
now
in
1951
when
it
settled
five
years
of
tax
liability.
so
a
reading
must
considered
that
we're
asking
it
to
take
a
deduction
five
times
$10.
the
taxpayer
says
that
in
effect,
it
should
deduct
the
$10
which
is
unsuccessfully
contested
only
in
the
later
year.
and
the
government
on
the
other
hand
says
that
the
method
you
treated
it
on
your
tax
return
is
what
is
required
by
the
annual
accounting
system
for
income
tax
purpose.
the
way
you
correct
your
adjustment
which
is
now
shown
to
have
been
slightly
erroneous
is
to
take
the
$5
which
is
refunded
to
you
back
into
income.
now,
i'm
sure
that
we
all
recognize
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
true.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
we
have
the
problem
--
for
example,
there
might
be
a
prepayment
of
tax
before
the
tax
year
which
came
up.
for
example,
if
he
prepaid
1949
taxes
in
1948
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
--
the
tax
--
the
cash
basis
taxpayer
would
report
on
the
method
we're
now
urging
as
well.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
that's
right,
that's
right.
but
this
--
i
don't
think
we're
converting
this
man
to
a
--
the
respondent
to
a
cash
basis
because
it
is
our
position
not
that
we
use
a
hybrid
method
at
all,
but
that
under
any
proper
accrual
accounting
system,
payment
which
distinguishes
a
liability,
it
so
brings
about
an
accrual
within
the
full
meaning
of
the
accrual
concept.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
but
it
would
not
be
our
position.
that
--
that
is
actually
raised
in
the
first
court
of
claims
case
involving
the
same
parties.
there
was
a
slight
prepayment
of
tax
in
court
of
claims
though
adopted
the
rule
which
the
government
urges
here
today
said
that
that
did
not
go
as
far
as
to
permit
the
prepayment
to
be
deducted
for
an
accrual
basis
of
taxpayer.
i
did
want
to
mention
to
the
court
at
just
this
point
that
this
is
not
the
first
time
this
taxpayer
has
made
this
claim.
for
the
years
1938
through
1940,
that's
three
years,
were
similarly
contested
and
settled
in
1941.
exactly
the
same
contentions
were
made,
the
same
stipulated
example
was
made,
this
was
went
through
the
court
of
claims
and
it
was
decided
adversely
to
the
respondent,
certiorari
was
denied.
now,
naturally
enough
in
the
first
instance
in
the
hearing
of
this
case
before
the
district
court,
the
government
urged
that
perhaps
some
doctrine
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
stopper
would
preclude
respondent
from
re-litigating
the
issue.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
second
circuit
felt
that
there
was
the
complete
identity
of
facts
required
by
the
sunnen
case,
that's
in
333
u.s.
thus,
both
courts
found
against
the
government
of
that
issue,
this
is
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
--
i
believe
it's
our
position
that
payment
is
a
--
is
a
transcendent
fact
when
a
man
makes
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that
--
that's
true.
but
we
--
we
have
in
the
code
a
recognition
that
a
--
a
prepayment
situation
would
distort
the
annual
accounting
principle.
it
would
take
the
taxes
out
of
the
year
to
which
they
are
attributable.
and
the
language
in
section
43
which
is
sometimes
cited
for
this
purpose
is
design
to
deal
with
--
with
that
problem.
there
is
a
special
authority
in
there
that
works
necessarily
to
clear
to
reflect
income,
the
deductions
or
credit
should
be
taken
of
a
different
period.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
believe
accounting
is
--
is
designed
to
meet
the
realities
in
situation.
i
assume
that
in
any
substantial
contest,
any
statement
of
financial
condition
given
out
by
the
taxpayer
would
have
to
make
some
note
of
this
contested
taxes
that
there
is
a
claim
and
that
the
financial
picture
of
the
corporation
cannot
be
adequately
represented
without
specifying
that.
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
any
court
would
go
so
far
as
to
hold
that
such
specification
was
an
admission
of
an
amount.
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
there
was
a
footnote
that
this
is
contested,
you
could
still
accrue
for
tax
purposes
without
embarrassing
yourself
before
the
court.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
would
--
i
--
i
don't
object
to
the
footnote,
i
object
to
not
accruing.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
think
the
government
would
not
recognize
such
an
estimate.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
that
is
not
our
case.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
but
i
--
i
--
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
argument
last
monday
has
some
bearing
on
this,
an
accrual
system
where
you
put
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
this
is
a
different
case
but
you
are
taking
a
closer
to
that.
the
accrual
system
when
you
get
into
the
business
of
putting
up
an
estimate
is
peculiarly
subject
to
abuse
and
peculiarly
beyond
the
control
of
the
government.
and
unless
congress
makes
--
gives
an
express
mandate
that
a
reserve
for
this
or
for
that
is
permitted,
the
government
is
not
going
to
welcome
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
subject
to
this
prepayment.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so.
we
--
we're
not
--
we're
claiming
that
any
proper
accrual
system
takes
account
of
the
fact
whether
payment
has
been
made.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
first
let
me
point
out
that
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
this
is
the
method
used
on
the
taxpayer's
books.
there
is
--
the
findings
in
this
case
are
somewhat
less
complete
than
they
were
in
the
earlier
case.
in
the
earlier
case,
it
was
made
very
clear
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
follow
the
method
which
he's
urging
here
in
its
own
books.
it
is
trying
to
get
a
special
rule
for
tax
purposes
which
may
also
be
adopted
on
its
own
book.
so,
that
this
is
not
a
case,
what
we
are
trying
to
do
what
the
tax
--
let
the
taxpayer
do
what
it's
done
on
his
own
books.
he
says
that
the
only
proper
way
to
treat
the
accrual
of
taxes
is
to
do
what
he
has
alleged
here.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
i
say
that's
proper.
i
say
that
the
record
here
is
perhaps
--
is
--
is
not
complete
on
that
specific
point
coming
as
it
did
after
the
earlier
case.
in
the
earlier
case,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
books
accrued
the
taxes
on
the
basis
of
the
original
assessments.
there's
been
no
claim
by
anyone
that
the
--
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
the
taxpayer's
book
but,
it
is
not
--
nothing
on
that
point
is
directly
supportive
by
the
record.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
issue
with
the
statement
of
the
question
as
stated
by
the
respondent
on
page
2
of
his
brief.
he
purports
to
make
an
all
important
distinction
between
our
phrase,
"pays
a
local
property
tax
assessment
under
protest
and
then
sues
to
recover
part
of
the
payment."
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
page
2
of
the
respondent's
brief.
he
states
--
we
take
our
statement
case
and
he
says
that
it
is
improper
for
failing
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
is
involuntary
paid
because
"it
was
necessary
to
state
the
imposition
of
penalties
and
foreclosure
of
the
tax
leans."
now,
we
--
we
would
urge
on
the
court
very
strongly
that
the
question
is
as
the
government
has
stated.
a
careful
reading
of
the
second
circuit
opinion,
well,
i
believe,
convinced
the
members
of
the
court
that
the
second
circuit
even
though
it
reached
the
result
contrary
to
the
government,
did
not
put
great
weight
on
the
fact
that
this
payment
was
involuntary.
now,
i
suppose
it's
very
hard
to
describe
a
voluntary
payment
of
taxes.
i
suppose
if
we
had
a
payment
of
tax
without
adequate
enforcement,
there
would
be
very
few
payments
of
tax
and
perhaps
if
there
were
no
enforcement,
it
could
be
described
as
voluntary.
but
to
attempt
to
go
in
to
the
motive
of
a
person
making
a
payment
of
tax
or
give
the
government
an
impossible
job
of
administration,
not
only
are
there
hundreds
of
taxing
statutes
with
all
kinds
of
sanctions
to
compel
payment
but
also
suppose
under
this
case,
suppose
another
new
york
city
taxpayer
comes
in
and
says,
"well,
i
know
that
those
are
penalties
but
that
wasn't
the
reason
i
made
payment.
i
made
payment
because
we
had
extra
cash
around
and
it
seemed
to
us
sound
a
business
judgment
to
pay
the
tax,
get
it
back
with
6%
interest
which
would
be
--
would
fit
our
purposes
better."
i
assume
that
no
one
ask
for
the
subjective
test
but
i'm
sure
that
this
court
does
not
wish
to
be
put
in
the
position
or
to
put
the
government
in
the
position
of
going
in
each
payment
and
determining
how
willing
the
payment
was.
so,
this
brings
us
back
to
the
real
issue
which
we
--
we
perhaps
discuss
completely
whether
payment
in
the
tax
year
itself
brings
about
accrual
under
the
accrual
system
of
accounting.
even
though
at
that
time,
there
is
a
contest
pending
which
may
resolve
in
a
refund.
now,
this
is
a
question
on
which
men
may
differ
as
indeed
the
court
below
has.
but
we
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
real
principles
underlying
dixie
pine
and
security
flour
mills,
you
will
--
you
will
agree
that
the
--
what
we
are
looking
for
is
where
is
the
contingency?
what
is
contingent?
and
at
the
end
of
the
tax
year
in
this
case
as
in
other
cases
arise
here,
the
contingency
is,
is
this
taxpayer
going
to
get
his
money
back?
and
if
we
permit
this
method
of
accounting,
we
are
holding
the
wrong
question
in
suspense.it's
not
whether
he's
going
to
pay
the
tax.
he's
paid
it.
he
doesn't
owe
any
tax.
and
if
it
--
and
if
he
--
for
some
strange
reason,
the
dispute
has
never
terminated,
which
method
will
reflect
it
better?
it
would
be
the
method
that
recognizes
where
the
cash
dollars
are.
the
city
has
the
dollars.
it's
collected
its
tax.
it
may
or
may
not
refund
the
tax.
now,
i
don't
want
to
--
to
claim
that
dixie
pine
and
security
mills
compel
this
result.i
don't
believe
they
do.
and
it
would
be
hypocritical
perhaps
because
the
government
has
often
and
court
cases
urged
the
opposite
result.
but
let
me
say
that
a
reading
of
those
two
opinions
which
are
quite
briefed
will
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
in
both
--
in
both
decisions,
the
court
was
quite
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
tax
had
not
in
fact
been
paid.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
what
is
involved
in
his
case
is
the
fact
that
the
--
there
is
a
difference
in
tax
rates
between
the
years.
1951
was
a
korean
excess
profits
tax
year.
and
that
the
earlier
years,
the
corporations
were
taxed
at
lower
rates.
so
that
by
not
taking
any
deduction
in
1949
for
example,
i'm
taking
it
in
1951,
it's
worth
the
great
deal
more.
i'm
not
sure
if
the
exact
percentages
but
say
that
a
deduction
is
--
is
worth
40%
in
1949
and
its
worth
65%
in
1951,
that's
where
the
difference
lie.
now,
may
i
say
this
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
quite
true.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
think
everybody
agrees
that
there
is
a
danger
in
the
dixie
pine
approach
that
must
be
tempered
by
the
good
faith.
let
me
say
this
though
about
the
matter,
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
contest
is
in
good
faith.
but
suppose
a
--
a
large
utility
paying
a
great
number
of
taxes
is
running
a
--
running
a
big
contest,
who
can
say
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
it's
running
a
big
contest
with
the
local
authorities
about
this.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
who
is
to
say
that
when
it
comes
to
settling
that
dispute,
it
won't
cast
an
eye
at
what's
going
to
happen
when
it
takes
the
deduction
if
the
respondent's
method
is
adopted
here?
it
will
look
to
that.
now
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
no,
but
they
--
suppose
that
they
--
there
is
already
a
perspective
lowering
of
rates
where
there's
a
particular
reasons
for
lowering
tax
liability
in
this
year.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
payment
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
because,
if
the
city
authorities
do
not
have
any
payment
that
they're
worried
about,
they
are
not
going
to
press
for
settlement.
if
the
city
authorities
do
have
to
worry
about
payment,
they're
not
going
to
let
the
taxpayer
sit
around
and
wait
until
it's
convenient
for
him
to
take
a
deduction,
so
that
the
--
the
danger
of
tax
evasion
is
really
in
this
running
account
with
the
local
authorities.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
danger
to
the
federal
revenues
that
they
--
that
they
will
be
completely
free
to
time
their
deduction
to
take
maximum
advantage
if
the
state
authorities
are
not
present.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
can
agree
with
mr.
polk
that
if
this
payment
of
tax
liability
was
a
deposit
of
tax,
then
he
is
correct
and
the
government
is
wrong.
but
i
see
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
would
suggest
that
this
was
anything
other
that
a
payment
of
tax.
i
don't
have
the
full
new
york
statutes
with
me.
they
are
here.
they're
cited
in
mr.
polk's
brief
but
note
to
the
new
york
statute
talks
about
a
refund.
it
is
not
a
return
of
deposit.
a
substantial
change
of
position
has
occurred.
this
is
a
matter
which
this
court
considered
carefully
in
the
rosenman
case
in
--
for
federal
tax
purposes
in
deciding
when
a
payment
has
occurred.
and
that
this
court
should
decide
it
under
the
new
york
procedures.
this
is
not
a
payment
of
tax.
it
did
not
extinguish
the
liability
and
mr.
polk
is
correct.
but
i'm
sure
that
this
record
will
not
in
any
sense
support
such
a
finding.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
don't
believe
that
it
got
to
that
because
i
don't
believe
despite
the
--
the
attempt
of
respondent
here,
there
really
is
an
issue
under
new
york
law
that
this
is
a
full
payment
of
tax
which
extinguishes
the
liability
and
subject
to
refund.
the
new
york
statute
calls
to
that,
so
for
that
reason
i
don't
believe
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
it
is
true
in
our
approach
that
we
must
find
whether
there
is
a
payment
or
not.
we
--
we
would
agree
that
if
there's
a
merely
a
deposit,
then
it
should
not
be
treated
to
satisfaction.
that's
necessary
to
be
consistent
with
earlier
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
and
i
have
no
doubt
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes,
yes.
but
i
think
the
statute
is
evidence
on
its
phase.
there
is
no
question
but
what
--
in
a
deposit,
the
liability
has
not
discharged.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
--
i
won't
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
the
only
litigation
i'm
aware
is
awarding
interest
to
the
taxpayer.
that
case
is
cited
in
our
brief
that
they
awarded
interest
to
the
taxpayer
when
they
gave
the
money
back.that's
inconsistent
with
the
deposit.
the
discharge
of
liability
is
inconsistent.
i
don't
believe
there
is
a
substantial
question.
i
don't
believe
this
meets
the
federal
standard
of
the
deposit.
now,
just
in
closing
let
me
state.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
we
are
getting
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
--
new
york
cannot
call
it
a
deposit
if
it
doesn't
have
the
earmarks
of
the
deposit.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
and
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
will
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
--
i
will
walk
in
you
independent
reexaminations.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
it
--
it
is
--
it
is
my
view
and
the
view
of
the
government
that
the
full
tax
became
due
--
due
and
paid
in
the
tax
year.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
i
believe
it
became
fixed
in
law
in
amount
there.
what
happened
afterwards
was
whether
the
man
got
a
right
to
a
refund
subsequent
--
by
subsequent
events.
and
the
subsequent
event
which
determined
whether
he
got
a
refund
and
how
much
of
a
refund
he
got
occurred
in
1951.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
but
i
don't
believe
there's
any.
i
--
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear
on
that.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
he
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
that
extinguished
his
liability
for
tax
--
for
a
tax
of
$100
shown
on
the
books
and
he
could
never
be
sued
for
that
and
if
the
contest
had
been
allowed
to
go
on
forever
without
being
settled,
his
tax
liability
for
the
year
was
paid.
there
was
no
further
contingency
as
to
that
$100
which
had
in
fact
been
paid.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way
mr.
justice
harlan
that
--
that
there
it
--
let
us
take
the
taxpayer's
word
that
there
is
no
other
method
under
the
laws
of
new
york.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
yes.
and
so
therefore,
he
cannot
contest
the
tax
but
we're
not
harming
taxpayers
here.
if
this
was
a
case
where
taxpayers
were
trying
to
accelerate
their
deductions
and
there
were
some,
excuse
me
--
if
taxpayers
were
--
were
in
a
position
where
it
harmed
them
to
bring
the
deductions
down
to
the
current
year,
then
i
would
think
there
would
be
some
equity
in
the
fact
that
new
york
does
not
offer
an
alternate
procedure.
but,
by
and
large
for
the
run
of
the
mill
common
taxpayer,
a
decision
that
--
in
accordance
with
the
government's
position
today
will
--
will
aid
most
taxpayers.
it's
only
the
occasional
taxpayer
who's
able
to
collect
the
liability,
keep
it
in
suspense
for
a
while
and
then
pull
it
down
when
he
needs
it.
that's
--
and
he
--
i
don't
think
we
need
to
worry
about
an
equity
that
new
york
deprives
him
of
this
way
of
manipulating
tax
form.
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
in
suppose
--
in
suppose
that
there
is
--
perhaps
suggested.
no
question
that
this
is
a
payment
of
tax
and
the
new
york
just
set
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
suppose
--
mr.
john
b.
jones,
jr.
alright.
suppose
the
new
york
law
just
stated
absolutely
boldly
the
tax
must
be
paid
so
is
for
refund
may
be
entertained
in
the
succeeding
year,
it
seems
to
us
that
that's
almost
as
what
law
does
say
here.
and
in
that
situation,
the
contingency
is
will
the
man
get
a
refund.
he
has
discharged
his
liability.
his
books
vis-à-vis
the
governmental
entity
are
satisfied.
they
are
not
going
to
be
pressing
him
for
anything
and
that
a
true
substance
of
this
matter
is
that
the
contingency
lies
in
the
refund.
and
in
effect
under
the
respondent's
method
here,
you're
allowed
to
anticipate
the
refund
and
if
you're
wrong
in
that,
make
the
adjustment
in
later
year.
we
say
that
payment
is
what
governs.
it
extinguishes
the
liability
and
after
that,
there
is
no
tax
in
dispute.
what
in
dispute
is
the
right
of
refund.
