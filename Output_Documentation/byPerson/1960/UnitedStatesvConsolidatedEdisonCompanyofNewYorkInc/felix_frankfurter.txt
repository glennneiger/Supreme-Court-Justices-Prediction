justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
the
record,
i
want
to
know
mr.
jones
what
extent
determination
of
this
case
turn
on
a
precise,
an
exact
appreciation
of
the
new
york
law
with
reference
to
this
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
--
that
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
it's
clear
for
federal
purposes
what
this
is.
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
does
one
have
to
determine,
will
he
be
alright
about
that.
it
doesn't
have
to
pass
a
construe
new
york
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
turn
on
how
new
york
conceive
this,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
turns
--
well,
that
turns
on
the
first
statutes
in
how
the
court
has
construed
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
not
contesting
anything
you
say.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
the
basis
on
which
i
must
decide
this
case.
you
said
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
phase.
but
nothing
is
more
pressure
but
you
suggest
--
for
you
to
suggest
that
for
us
to
act
on
the
suggestion
that
all
one
has
to
do
is
to
read
the
new
york
statute
to
find
out
what
it
mean.that
is
true
sometimes
but
i
should
think
it
--
that
it
isn't
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
--
if
you
say
that
the
statute
is
quite
clear,
there
has
been
no
litigation
under
it,
there'd
be
doubt
cash
on
it
or
no
practice
that
looks
the
other
way
as
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
say
all
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
now
should
be
federal
standard.
that's
what
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
have
to
decide
whether
this
--
whether
the
payment
is
a
general
federal
concept
or
does
one
revert
to
the
new
york
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
can
capriciously
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
the
incidence,
that
legal
consequences
and
incident
that
new
york
may
attach,
they
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
--
i
even
bother
about
that.
it's
clear
--
it's
clear
as
the
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
be
on
the
day
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
