mr.
james
k.
polk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
single
question
involved
here.
the
question
is
the
proper
year
for
the
deduction
of
contested,
litigated,
unadmitted
real
property
taxes.
the
government
is
--
has
misstated
the
issue
20
odd
times
in
its
brief
where
it
refers
to
this
contest
litigation
as
a
suit
for
refund.
there
has
been
no
such
thing
as
a
suit
for
refund
of
local
taxes
in
the
state
of
new
york
since
1880.
this
proceeding
starts
as
a
contest
of
a
--
of
a
tentative
assessment
of
value
of
real
property
taxes
and
application
for
correction
of
the
assessed
valuation
is
filed.
that
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
for
any
contest
in
the
state
of
new
york.
if
that
is
not
filed,
there
can
no
suit
ever
be
brought
on
any
ground.
the
tax
will
become
final
and
owing.
that
has
to
be
followed
up
by
a
certiorari
proceeding
filed
before
the
25th
of
october
of
the
taxable
year.
when
that
is
filed
its
certiorari
to
the
tax
commission
to
bring
before
the
court
the
proposal
of
assessment,
it
is
the
--
the
assessment
is
--
is
not
a
valid,
fixed
finalized
thing
until
after
this
litigation
is
terminated.
so,
the
precise
question
in
this
case
is
whether
while
such
a
litigation
is
pending
to
determine
if
there
is
any
tax
and
if
there
is
a
tax
to
the
contested
amount.
if
there
is
any
tax,
the
amount
thereof
whether
a
payment
made
under
the
circumstances
related
here
will
accelerate
the
time
for
deduction.
now,
the
facts
as
--
as
have
been
related
are
substantially
accurate.
actually,
to
simply
the
matter,
reference
was
not
made
to
the
fact
although
it
is
stipulated
and
in
the
record,
it
was
not
made
to
the
fact
that
the
payment
is
in
to
installments.
the
first
installment
is
due
october
1
of
the
tax
year
1949
in
the
illustrative
example.
the
second
installment
is
due
april
1
of
1950.
each
installment
was
paid,
it
was
paid
because
if
you
do
not
pay
that
tax
as
bills,
although
it
as
not
yet
determined
or
fix
or
finalized,
if
you
do
not
pay
it,
a
lean
--
leans
attached,
the
property
can
be
seized
and
sold
to
satisfy
the
lean.
there
is
a
compulsion
there,
an
economic
compulsion
that
makes
it
very
practical
to
pay.
that
gets
the
moneys
into
the
city
--
into
the
city
treasuries
in
regular
order.
that
enables
the
city
counsel
to
assert
the
proper
tax
rate
because
it
knows
by
the
time
it
does
that
exactly
how
much
is
in
contest.
only
for
the
application
for
correction
has
been
filed,
admitting
tax
liability
which
is
irrevocably
admitted
there,
that's
the
$85,
only
then
have
you
any
remainder
that
can
possibly
be
in
dispute.
now,
the
--
the
taxpayer
has
claimed
the
deduction
for
the
$85
in
1949.
it
claims
that
no
further
amount
is
deductible
until
some
tax
is
validated,
finalized
in
a
pending
litigation
and
that
did
not
occur
in
this
case
until
1951.
at
which
time,
the
court's
said
you
owe
$10
more,
a
payment
has
been
made.
but
that
payment
was
no
different
from
the
payment
in
the
rosenman
case
or
the
lewyt
in
the
second
circuit,
the
issue
that
wasn't
brought
up
here.
that
is
a
deposit.
it's
a
payment
in
advance
of
a
determination
of
tax.
it
can't
be
a
payment
of
tax.
the
--
the
reason
--
the
government
bases
its
case
upon
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
claims
in
the
chestnut
securities
case.
in
the
chestnut
securities
case,
the
facts
were
identical
as
far
as
the
issue
is
concerned.
there
were
disputed
taxes
from
1936,
1937,
and
1938,
a
dispute
that
it
did
not
terminate
until
1942.
in
1942,
the
taxpayer
lost
his
case
and
owed
the
tax.
it
paid
the
taxes
in
1940
and
attempted
to
deduct
that
amount
its
1940
returned,
the
government
said,
"no."
the
commissioner's
position
at
that
time
and
its
position
in
several
of
these
cases
was
the
same,
was
it
you
should
relate
the
amount
back
to
the
year
for
which
the
tax
was
asserted,
a
position
untenable
completely
so
under
the
security
flour
mills
doctrine
of
this
court.
the
--
when
the
--
consequently,
when
the
case
got
tried
in
the
court
of
claims
in
the
chestnut
securities,
when
it
got
tried,
the
government
shifted
its
position
adopting
dixie
pine
and
said,
"yes,
1940
is
still
not
the
right
year
but
it's
1942."
that
is
the
precise
position
that
the
respondent
is
now
taking.
it's
taking
the
position
the
government
originally
took.
in
the
court
of
claims,
in
the
chestnut
securities
case,
announced
a
rule
of
accrual
accounting.
it
said
accrual
cannot
survive
payment
so
far
as
the
deter
is
concern,
and
it
said
that
that
was
within
its
understanding
of
the
terminology
of
accounting.
now,
the
respondent
had
a
case
involving
that's
been
referred
to
of
1938,
1939
and
1941.disputed
taxes
of
1938,
1939,
finalized
in
1941
and
attempt
to
take
the
deduction
in
1941,
the
government
disallowed
it,
we
brought
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
for
a
refund
for
that
year
on
the
ground
that
the
tax
--
the
disputed
amount
finalized
in
that
year
was
then
deductible,
the
identical
question
that
had
been
involved
in
chestnut
securities.
now,
in
chestnut
securities,
there
is
no
evidence
of
record
whatsoever
concerning
accrual
accounting,
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
in
the
brief
of
either
party.
but
in
the
consolidated
edison
case
of
1938
and
1939,
evidence
was
adduced.
evidence
was
put
in
so
that
the
court
found
the
facts
respecting
accrual
accounting
and
the
effective
cash.cash
had
--
flow
of
cash
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
accrual.
accrual
can
precede,
coincide
with
or
survive
payment.
payment
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
the
instances
of
accrual
surviving
payment
are
legion.
it's
the
foundation
in
the
backbone
of
accrual
accounting.
all
prepaid
expenses
deferred
charges
to
future
operations
or
depreciation
deductions
40
years
after
payment
are
instances
of
accrual
surviving
payment.
inventories
are
--
where
the
purchases
are
not
deducted
in
the
year
in
which
they're
paid.
the
--
the
government
won't
permit
tax
returns
for
inventories
are
employed
except
on
the
accrual
basis.
the
--
the
whole
fundamental
concept
of
accrual
is
--
is
the
--
is
the
antithesis
of
the
cash,
receipts
and
disbursements
theory.
the
result
of
that
was
that
the
court
of
claims
found
as
a
fact
in
the
--
found
facts
in
the
consolidated
edison
case
respecting
accrual
accounting
and
the
effect
of
the
flow
of
cash
and
found
them
in
the
terms
of
this
illustrative
example.
those
findings
of
fact
for
the
convenience
of
this
court
are
reproduced
as
exhibit
2
--
appendix
2
of
respondent's
brief,

my
associates
says.
now,
the
court
of
claims
in
the
consolidated
edison
case,
however,
had
this
to
say
when
it
came
to
reach
its
decision.
it
said,
"we
do
not
hold
that
accrual
cannot
survive
payment."
they
said,
"what
we
hold
is
the
payment
of
an
item
which
is
otherwise
accruable
in
the
taxable
year
accrues
the
item."
now,
we
couldn't
understand
that.
if
an
item
is
otherwise
accruable
in
the
taxable
year,
it's
otherwise
accruable
in
the
taxable
year
and
you
have
no
need
to
refer
the
payment
or
to
anything
else
in
the
world.
we
sought
to
review
this
decision
but
there
was
no
conflict
at
the
time
and
this
court
did
not
allow
our
application
for
certiorari.
however,
the
--
since
that
time,
a
conflict
has
a
reason.
the
conflict
has
a
reason
not
in
the
--
in
the
frame
that
the
government
puts
the
picture
not
where
there
has
been
a
payment
of
a
tax
and
then
he
suit
for
refund
because
the
payment
of
a
tax
where
tax
is
finalized
and
paid
is
customarily
and
admission
of
that
liability.
and
as
an
admission
of
liability,
a
proper
basis
for
accrual
that
by
the
way
is
the
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
court
in
the
western
cartridge
case
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment.
but
the
court
did
decide
in
the
northern
district
--
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
ohio
in
the
standard
oil
of
ohio
case
that
the
accrual
can
--
can
of
course
survive
payments
and
that
the
chestnut
securities
doctrine
was
in
error.
now,
in
that
case,
you
had
some
excised
taxes,
excised
taxes,
federal
excised
taxes
on
oil
from
1932
and
1933.
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
does
not
have
to
send
a
notice
of
deficiency
for
excised
taxes
and
he
just
assessed
them
as
a
jeopardy
assessment.
the
taxpayer
litigated
this.
the
propriety
of
that
tax
liability
contested
it
until
1947
when
he
lost
his
case
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
he
deducted
in
1937
the
amount
when
he
paid
it.
the
commissioner
said,
"no,
throw
it
back
to
1932
and
1933
the
years
for
which
the
taxes
asserted."
and
of
course,
that's
wrong
under
the
security
flour
mills.
and
then
the
taxpayer
deducted
it
in
1947
when
the
contest
finished.
this
time,
the
commissioner
said,
"no,
it
belongs
back
in
1937
under
--
under
chestnut
securities."
the
accrual
cannot
survive
payment
so
the
issue
was
precisely
before
the
court.
and
what
did
the
court
say?
the
court
said
the
rule
to
be
uniformed
should
follow
the
straight
rule,
laid
down
in
dixie
pine
and
security
flour
that
all
events
do
not
occur
within
the
taxable
year
that
fix
the
amount
and
the
fact
that
tax
liability
until
the
litigation
has
ended.
then
the
court
observed,
after
all,
payment
is
not
really
one
of
the
events
which
fix
the
amount
or
the
fact
of
the
--
tax
liability
and
the
final
adjudication
is
the
last
to
those
events.
the
--
the
government
has
--
has
urged
that
there's
some
converse
of
a
claim
of
right
doctrine
involved
here
that
cash
should
be
followed
because
it's
definitive.
when
you
receive
cash,
it
has
to
be
income.
therefore,
when
you
pay
cash
out,
it
must
be
a
deduction.
utterly
inconsistent
with
accrual
accounting
concepts
but,
it's
also
inconsistent
because
it
isn't
the
convert.
this
case
is
not
the
converse
of
the
claim
of
right
doctrine.
this
is
a
disclaimer
of
deduction
and
its
--
its
opposite
or
converse
would
be
a
disclaimer
of
right
and
that
has
been
litigated.
that
was
litigated
in
this
ohio
corporation
case.
in
that
case,
the
taxpayer
had
been
compelled
by
state
law
to
take
--
to
receive
moneys
which
he
said
it
didn't
belong
to
it
and
sought
to
have
a
law
declared
unconstitutional.
but
the
commission
said,
you
have
received
cash
under
color
of
title,
if
not
claim
of
right
something,
you
have
received
cash
and
you
must
be
taxable
on
it.
but
the
court
disagreed.
the
court
said,
"we
do
not
think
that
when
a
taxpayer
is
compelled
by
state
authority
over
its
protest
to
retain
possession
temporarily
of
funds,
he
can't
be
charged
with
having
income
on
that
account."
the
cases
of
dixie
pine
and
security
flour
dealt
with
deductions
from
income
and
held
that
a
taxpayer
may
not
accrue
and
expense
the
liability
for
which
is
contingent
and
is
contested
by
the
taxpayer.
the
problem
in
the
present
case
concerns
income
rather
than
a
deduction
but
we
think
the
same
principle
applies.
if
as
a
matter
of
law
a
deduction
is
not
accruable,
if
the
liability
as
contingent
and
contested
by
the
taxpayer,
similarly,
income
is
not
accruable
if
the
right
thereto
is
contingent
being
denied
and
contested
by
the
taxpayer.
we
would
contend
that
just
as
for
a
taxpayer
who
receives
moneys
is
because
of
his
disclaimer
of
right
not
taxable
on
them,
so
a
taxpayer
who
denies
a
liability
--
who
denies
a
liability
and
who
disclaims
a
deduction
cannot
be
compelled
to
take
the
deduction.
now,
there's
a
variation
between
tax
accounting
and
recognized
principles
of
accounting
in
respect
of
the
protection
of
the
revenue
aspect
where
an
item
is
contingent
under
general
--
generally
recognized
principles
of
accounting.
you
will
use
a
reserve
approach
and
accrue
something
to
measure
that
and
bring
the
addition
to
the
reserve
or
the
charge
to
the
reserve
in
the
current
year.
you
have
that
for
reserve
for
intermission
damages.
all
sorts
of
reserves
in
that
kind
which
are
not
recognized
for
tax
purposes
although
they
are
for
accounting
purposes.
the
congress
in
enacting
section
462
sought
to
bring
those
to
closure
together.
it
sought
to
permit
in
462
the
deduction
of
some
of
this
contingent
liability
provision
--
provision
for
those
things
in
the
year
of
the
transaction
gave
rise
to
the
liability.but,
and
if
later
repeal
that
section,
it's
true.
but
it's
a
particular
significance
to
note
that
the
congress
said
even
as
to
section
462,
it
shall
not
reach
the
type
of
contingent
liability
that
is
in
litigation.
it's
specifically
excluded
litigated
matters
from
the
reach
of
462
and
let
them
to
united
states
versus
anderson,
all
the
events
must
occur
to
fix
the
amount
and
effect
of
liability
before
you
can
have
a
deduction,
to
chestnut
securities
that
a
--
a
contested
item
must
await
the
outcome
of
the
litigation
before
it
can
mature,
and
the
security
flour
mills
that
each
year
stands
on
its
own
basis.
mr.
james
k.
polk
i
meant
dixie
pine,
pardon
me.
mr.
james
k.
polk
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
k.
polk
you
--
you
cannot
sue
if
you
find
you
have
overpaid.
when
you
said
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
voluntary
payment
of
taxes,
i
was
a
little
puzzled.
i
don't
think
that
anybody
makes
any
very
voluntary
payment
of
a
--
of
an
enforced
obligation
like
a
tax.
but
in
the
state
of
new
york,
unless
you
contest
that
the
--
the
tentative
assessment
by
filing
an
application
for
correction
by
march
15th
and
admit
your
liability
to
the
extent
that
you
admitted,
the
$85
and
then
denied
that
there
is
any
further
liability
unless
you
do
that.
unless
that
paper
is
filed
under
new
york
law,
it
is
impossible
at
any
time
on
any
basis
to
recover
an
amount
paid.
the
--
the
new
york
statute
says
that
this
is
a
pre
--
that
the
filing
of
this
application
for
correction
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
institution
of
the
exclusives
judicial
remedy
that
is
allowed.
mr.
james
k.
polk
i
think
you
probably
could.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
k.
polk
yes.
mr.
james
k.
polk
that
is
correct.
that
is
--
mr.
james
k.
polk
we
--
we
claim
it
was
a
deposit.
the
court
of
claims
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
the
expert
accountants
in
their
findings
of
fact
which
we
have
reprinted
at
appendix
2
of
our
brief
found
that
that
was
a
deposit
and
should
be
so
accounted
for
as
a
deposit
under
accrual
principles
of
accounting.
it
is
not
the
satisfaction
of
a
liability
because
the
liability
isn't
fixed
yet.
that
is
the
fundamental
proposition
that
respondent
urges.
there
was
no
satisfaction
of
a
liability
here
by
this
half
payments
october
and
the
next
april.
and
by
the
way,
the
payments
were
not
made
in
advance
