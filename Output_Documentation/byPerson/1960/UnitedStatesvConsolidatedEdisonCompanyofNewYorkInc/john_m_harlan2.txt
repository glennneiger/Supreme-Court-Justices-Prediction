something
to
you?

difference
in
your
hypothetical
of
$85

sought
to
put
over
to

at

until

$15.
now,
supposing
he
had
undertaken
to
make
an
estimate
based
on
his
past
experience
with
the
city
of
new
york,
and
instead
of
putting
over
the
whole
$15,
he
had
undertaken
to
say,
"well,
i
think
the
reasonable
estimate
of
what
i'm
going
to
get
back
is
have
that
need
and
therefore,
he
had
reported

well,
i
just
wanted
to
get
your
thesis.
your
thesis
is
that
payment
closes
the
door
and
once
payment
is
made,
whether
under
protest
or
otherwise
that
fixes
the
