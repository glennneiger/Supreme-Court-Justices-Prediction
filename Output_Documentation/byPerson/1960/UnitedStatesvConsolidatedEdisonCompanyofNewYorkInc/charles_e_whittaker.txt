justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
already
paid
that
amount.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
jones.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
i
may
ask
you,
in
as
much
as
you
have
mentioned
prepayments,
is
it
your
contention
that
they
too
must
be
accrued
even
though
there
is
no
tax
yet
against
which
to
apply
them?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
you
--
if
you
would
not
contend
that
one
who
prepays
taxes
--
the
accrual
basis
taxpayer
must
accrued
them,
then,
how
can
you
contend
that
he
must
accrue
taxes
that
he
disputes
does
not
admit
to
be
due?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
there's
been
payment
when
there's
been
prepayment
to
something
that
he's
part
with
the
money,
can
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
i
find
on
your
books
in
the
suit
where
it's
to
my
interest
and
adverse
to
your
interest
and
admission
by
you
that
you
have
a
liability
that
you
accrue,
may
i
not
use
that
as
an
admission
against
interest
against
you?
and
isn't
it
true
that
if
you
setup
--
if
you
require
to
setup
an
accrued
liability
that
the
taxpayer
disputes,
aren't
you
making
any
setup
of
dishonest
entry?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
doesn't
that
read
section
41
out
of
the
book?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
last
stanza
to
51,
that
if
the
system
of
accounting
to
use
does
accurately
reflect
income,
the
commissioner
has
no
choice
but
to
accept
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
--
he
did
expense
it
all
here
in
the
original
years
of
payment
when
you
say
that
was
proper.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
polk?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
polk.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
can
there
be
such
a
thing
under
your
law,
in
the
state
law
as
a
voluntary
payment
of
real
property
tax?
or
is
it
always
a
deposits
and
you
can
sue
she'd
find
you've
overpaid,
now
what
is
the
situation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
suppose
you
have
by
far
payment,
the
prepayment
made
--
put
enough
money
with
the
tax
collector
to
cover
this
tax
in
advance
at
the
time
you
had
to
act.
you
still
--
but
--
by
the
taking
the
steps
you
will
require
here
or
you
outlined
here,
the
query
application,
that
22
tax,
could
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i'm
taking
out
(inaudible)
normally,
if
one
makes
whether
it's
a
voluntary
payment
then
he
was
on
the
accrual
basis,
it's
--
he
(inaudible)
statute
ruin.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
i
make
a
deposit
to
secure
a
debt
or
something
of
that
kind
which
is
not
include
the
payment,
then,
i
don't
have
to
admit
a
payment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
did
you
make
payment
or
did
you
make
a
deposit
(voice
overlap)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
jones,
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
give
your
idea
of
when
this
tax
became
fixed
in
fact
and
amount.
was
it
51
or
prior
51?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
is
the
one
i
want
to
know.
when
did
it
become
fixed
in
law
in
amount?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
case
turns
on
the
answer
to
that
question,
doesn't
it?
