that
one
ground
that
they
found
in
louisiana
statute,
a
lot
of
teachers
belong
to
the
organization.
the
louisiana
statutes
denied
an
employment
to
them,
if
they
believed
in
integration
of
the
racism
in
public
schools.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
such
a
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
could
they
know
it
wouldn't
be

you

25
years

it
but
--
justice

they
couldn't

justice

heavy
price
to
pay
to
belong
to
an
organization.
