mr.
william
p.schuler
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
the
matter
reached
as
this
court
today
on
appeal
from
the
eastern
district
court
for
the
state
of
louisiana.
a
three-judge
court
in
that
proceeding
held
unconstitutional,
two
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana
and
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
those
statutes.
and
so
under
the
provisions
of
28
u.s.c.1253,
this
matter
was
appealed
directly
to
this
court.
actually,
this
matter
involves
two
separate
lawsuits
which
were
consolidated
for
trial
in
the
court
below.
the
first
lawsuit
was
filed
in
march
of
1956
in
the
nineteenth
judicial
district
state
court.
that
suit
was
a
suit
by
the
former
attorney
general
which
sought
to
enjoin
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
its
affiliates
in
doing
business
in
the
state
because
they
had
failed
and
neglected
to
file
a
membership
and
officer
list
which
was
required
by
statute
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
passed
in
1924.
this
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
1924.
mr.
william
p.schuler
now,
this
suit
was
filed
on
march
1st,
1956
and
28
days
later,
the
defendants
therein,
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
various
individuals
went
in
the
federal
court
and
moved
that
the
said
suit
be
removed
to
the
federal
court.
the
federal
courts
on
the
removal
of
the
petition
and
the
case
remained
pending
or
i
should
say
dormant,
on
the
docket
of
that
court
now.
in
1958,
november
thereof,
there
was
a
new
suit
filed
in
the
eastern
district
of
the
state
of
louisiana
by
the
new
orleans
branch
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
seeking
to
have
the
constitutionality
of
act
20
--
act
2
of
1924
and
act
260
of
1958,
declared
unconstitutional
and
have
the
enforcement
thereof
enjoined
by
the
court.
these
two
cases
were
consolidated
at
the
trial
and
heard
by
a
three-judge
court
and
the
three-judge
court
rendered
an
opinion
in
february
29th
of
1960,
holding
that
these
two
statutes
were
unconstitutional.
the
first
statute
that
is
the
membership
list
statute
on
the
basis
that
it
conflicted
with
the
first
amendment
as
interpreted
by
the
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama
and
bates
versus
little
rock
cases.
the
second
statute,
a
communist
affidavit
statute,
i
--
they
held
it
was
in
conflict
with
the
due
process
clause
of
united
states
constitution
and
that
it
provided
for
a
filing
of
something
which
would've
be
impossible
to
be
within
the
knowledge
of
the
persons
required
to
file
it.
notice
of
appeal
in
this
matter
was
filed
in
april
25th,
1960
and
this
court
noted
the
probable
jurisdiction
on
the
24th
day
of
october,
1960.
actually,
the
primary
question
involved
herein
today,
is
a
clash,
conflict
between
the
state's
police
power
and
between
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment
of
united
states
constitution
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
the
freedom
of
association
doctrine,
while
never
so
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
when
we
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
don't
quite
follow
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
there
are
some
facts
that
are
agreed
upon,
others
that
are
in
dispute.
mr.
william
p.schuler
the
facts
are
that
in
1924,
the
state
of
louisiana
enacted
a
statute
known
as
a
membership
registration
statute.
your
honors
are
all
familiar
with
the
bryant
versus
zimmerman
case.
our
statute
is
very
similar
to
the
new
york
statute
in
that
case.
it
provides
that
each
--
once
each
year,
the
organizations
or
corporations
doing
business
in
the
state
of
louisiana
other
than
business
corporations,
must
file
with
the
secretary
of
state
a
list
of
the
members
of
the
corporation
as
well
as
a
list
of
the
officers
and
addresses
of
the
officers
of
the
corporation
or
association.
the
second
statute
involved
herein
was
passed
in
1958.
it
is
a
statute
which
requires
all
affiliates
within
the
state
that
have
parent
organizations
outside
the
state,
to
have
filed
with
the
state
and
the
secretary
of
state,
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
none
of
the
officers
of
the
parent
corporation
are
members
of
the
communist
party
or
members
of
any
organization,
to
create
subversive
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
now
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
they
have
not.
mr.
william
p.schuler
they
did
not
and
i
can't
find
any
record
of
any
being
filed
until
about
1956,
when
this
statute
was
brought
into
(b)
--
was
enforced.
now,
since
that
time,
we
have
some
2000
organizations
in
the
state
that
are
complying
with
the
requirements
of
filing
a
membership
list.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
it
does
not
show
what
the
then
attorney
general
did,
but
the
suit
was
filed
three
months
later,
the
present
attorney
general
took
office
and
he
served
notice
upon
all
organizations.
mr.
william
p.schuler
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
the
present
attorney
general
served
notice
upon
all
organizations
in
the
state
that
he
would
prosecute
them
if
they
would
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
this
statute
and
there's
--
he
has
an
affidavit
in
the
record
which
reflects
this
and
he
specifically
points
out
various
organizations
which
he
told
either
to
file
or
he
would
file
a
suit
against
them,
which
resulted
either
in
their
filing
a
membership
list
or
in
their
disbanding
the
organization.
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir.
there
--
the
statement
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
you
will
find
on
page
129
and
130,
an
affidavit
by
the
secretary
of
state
showing
the
number
of
organizations
which
filed
the
membership
list.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
it
does
not.
mr.
william
p.schuler
you
honor,
they're
--
actually,
there's
no
way
of
telling
under
the
laws
of
our
state.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
garden
clubs
mr.
william
p.schuler
the
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
well,
1959
your
honor
would
not
really
reflect
anything
because
the
period
of
time,
the
15-day
period
within
which
the
applications
or
the
membership
list
had
to
be
filed,
was
not
yet
completed
at
that
time.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
was
a
dropped,
but
i
have
no
explanation.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that's
perfectly
alright.
now,
i
believe
at
the
present
time,
are
there
any
factual
situations
that
are
not
quite
clear?
mr.
william
p.schuler
actually,
the
only
real
dispute
in
fact,
is
whether
or
not
there
were
economic
reprisals
against
members
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
whose
names
were
revealed
by
the
publication
of
this
membership
list.
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir.
some
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
they
filed
them
--
some
of
their
organizations
within
the
state
filed
them
for
two-year
periods.
since
1958,
they
have
refused
to
file
the
list
with
the
state
basing
their
contention
upon
the
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama
case.
of
course,
it's
very
curious
to
note
that
in
every
case
where
we
show
two
consecutive
years
that
an
n.a.a.c.p.
branch
filed
a
list
of
its
members.
it
increased
the
second
year
over
the
first.
in
other
words,
in
new
orleans,
they
nearly
tripled
after
they
filed
their
first
list.
in
lake
charles,
they
over
doubled
after
filing
their
list.
mr.
william
p.schuler
1956.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that's
right.
there
were
some
made
in
1956,
some
in
1957
and
i
believe
some
in
1958.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
absolutely
correct.
they've
refused
to
file
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
a
fact
that
particular
proposition
is
actually
in
both
suits.
the
only
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
we
have
nowhere,
none.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
said
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
said
that
several
of
the
affiliates
within
the
state
did
file
membership
lists.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.schuler
in
one
year,
we
had
as
many
as
11
filed.
on
various
years,
it
has
gone
from
1
or
2
to
11
and
backed
down
to
none.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record,
i
know
there
are
more.
mr.
william
p.schuler
we
have
not
had
one
affidavit
or
one
membership
list
or
officer
list
filed
with
the
states
as
1958.
mr.
william
p.schuler
by
any
affiliate
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
mr.
william
p.schuler
oh,
yes
sir.
as
i
stated
in
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
it
would
operate
on
the
national,
if
they
desire
to
do
business
in
the
state
which
they
do.
mr.
william
p.schuler
they
would
be
required
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
their
membership
list
would
only
be
of
their
members
within
the
state.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
only
certain
affiliates
within
the
state
filed
that
list.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
didn't
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
the
certain
locals
or
affiliates
of
the
national
body.
mr.
william
p.schuler
well,
i
don't
know
what
it's
exactly
like.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
it's
--
i
guess
what
you
might
call
sort
of
like
a
local
union
and
a
--
and
a
national.
it's
an
affiliate
of
the
national
body
and
follows
a
policy
in
constitution
thereof.
mr.
william
p.schuler
on
page
132,
133
and
134,
an
affidavit
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
the
attorney
general
made
it
general
and
--
and
just
by
conversations,
by
references
in
newspaper
that
he
was
going
to
enforce
the
law.
this
affidavit
in
here
is
an
affidavit
by
the
attorney
general
as
to
the
means
and
methods
he
took
to
communicate
his
policy
to
the
public
at
large.
mr.
william
p.schuler
of
and
i
would
say,
it
would
be
his
duty.
it's
his
duty
under
the
statute.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
he
did
not.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
did
not.
i
said
if
a
suit
was
filed
in
19
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
as
i
say,
it
all
depends
on
what
you
consider
an
announcement.
as
i
said,
the
attorney
general
in
his
affidavits
set
forth
that
he
made
announcement
generally
to
the
public
that
he
was
intending
to
enforce
the
statute
which
under
his
--
under
the
laws
setup,
he
was
required
to
do.
he
advised
organizations
for
the
fact
that
they
would
have
to
file
a
list.
i
think
the
affidavit
more
than
speaks
for
itself.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
believe,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
may
of
1956.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.schuler
well,
if
--
if
you're
going
to
address
it
up
into
a
formal
statement
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
such
thing.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
as
i
say,
in
the
affidavit,
the
attorney
general
sets
forth
the
means
by
--
the
means
he
took
in
order
to
inform
the
public
of
his
intention
to
follow
the
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct
with
one
thing
i'm
not
sure,
whether
or
not,
there
was
any
compliance
there
would
immediately
in
1924.
mr.
william
p.schuler
it
--
i
can
say
with
a
--
a
shortness
that
there
was
no
compliance
from
1950
until
1956.
mr.
william
p.schuler
yet,
i
would
say
it
was
used
to
enjoin
it
from
doing
business
because
they
failed
and
refused
to
file
their
list
in
conformance
with
the
law.
mr.
william
p.schuler
it
has
been
contended
by
the
plaintiffs
herein,
however,
i
find
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
was
the
only
reason
and
i
would
say
that
the
evidence
would
belie
that
since
as
i
say,
the
attorney
general
has
vigorously
seen
to
it
that
other
organizations
within
the
state
had
to
make
equal
compliance
with
the
law
as
reflected
by
the
organizations
that
have
filed
in
accordance
with
that
statute.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
would
say
that
the
passage
of
this
statute
in
1924
sounded
the
death
knell
of
the
clan
in
the
state
as
a
real
active
organization
after
the
statute
had
very
rapidly
passed
out
of
the
picture.
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
it
did.
mr.
william
p.schuler
oh,
your
honor,
i'm
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
--
i'm
rather
ignorant
too,
i
wasn't
born
then.[laughter]
mr.
william
p.schuler
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
i
would
have
extreme
doubt
with
regard
to
the
knights
of
columbus
and
the
masonic
temple
lodge,
since
they
could
very
easily
come
under
the
definition
of
a
religious
order
or
they're
not
a
church.
i
think
the
knights
of
columbus
and
the
masonic
temple
are
--
masons
are
close
enough
to
being
a
religious
organization
to
be
exempt
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
p.schuler
well,
you
honor,
i
know
that
everything
that
they
have
in
the
masons
to
a
larger
extent,
deals
with
--
i
--
i
would
say
regard
in
church
principles.
mr.
william
p.schuler
they
have
to
comply.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
the
record
will
show
that
the
ladies'
garden
clubs
comply
too.
mr.
william
p.schuler
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
there
are
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
as
i
attempt
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
as
i
attempted
to
explain,
your
honor,
the
registration
period
for
that
year
had
not
closed
on
the
date
that
the
court
order
that
the
secretary
of
state
to
produce
that
information.
the
organizations
that
desired
to
file
still
had
several
weeks.
after
that
total
was
given
within
which
to
file
the
membership
in
their
organizations
and
come
within
compliance,
so
that
figure
could
not
be
used
at
all.
mr.
william
p.schuler
getting
--
i
think
we
have
--
well,
there's
one
more
question
really
that
comes
up.
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
was
any
--
any
economic
reprisals
or
intimidation
as
a
result
of
the
publication
of
these
names
and
lists.
as
i've
stated,
the
state
here
is
in
rather
bad
position
to
prove
anything.
the
only
thing
we
know
about
the
members
are
the
information
that
the
organizations
have
filed
with
us.
as
i
say
however,
each
organization,
n.a.a.c.p.
affiliate
within
the
state
that
did
file
a
membership
list
for
a
two
consecutive
year
period,
shows
that
the
second
year,
their
membership
increased
substantially
over
the
first
year.
thus,
it's
rather
hard
to
say
that
the
filing
of
the
membership
acted
as
a
deterrent
upon
membership
because
they
actually
increased
after
each
filing.
now,
there
is
some
evidence
given
by
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
persons
were
discriminated
against.
the
affidavits
are
very
general,
a
man
comes
in,
we
have
some
several
of
the
gentlemen
who
were
officers
in
various
branches
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
who
came
in
and
filed
affidavits
to
the
effect
that
they
had
been
discriminated
against.
in
order
to
go
behind
these
affidavits,
the
state
of
louisiana
took
the
deposition
of
these
individuals.
and
almost
without
exception,
the
testimony
elicited
from
them
while
under
interrogatories
and
examination,
show
that
these
affidavits
that
had
originally
filed
were
no
sense
correct.
they
--
people
who
had
stated
that
they
were
discriminated
against
upon
cross-examinations
said
that
nobody
ever
talked
to
him
about
their
membership
in
the
organization.
in
fact,
one
gentleman
who
said
he
had
been
discriminated
against
was
drawing
an
old
age
pension
from
the
state
when
he
wasn't
entitled
thereto,
he
testified
that
he
and
his
wife
who
were
members
in
the
organization,
had
never
been
reproached,
nobody
had
ever
discussed
the
matter
with
him.
yet,
his
affidavit
said
that
he
had
been
discriminated
against.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
because
that's
the
only
way
the
district
court
in
our
district
will
allow
us
to
try
a
preliminary
injunction
suit.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.schuler
we
have
requested
on
several
occasions
to
try
them
by
other
manners
and
our
district
court
says
that
it
does
not
try
preliminary
injunctions
other
than
by
affidavit.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
they
--
one
newspaper
in
coushatta
published
some
for
the
red
river
branch
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
generally,
i
don't
believe
they
were
published.
the
only
fact
--
the
only
way,
i
was
able
to
derive
information
as
to
the
number
of
members
in
the
various
organizations
on
particular
years,
was
to
go
to
the
secretary
of
state's
office
and
count
off
the
number
of
members
that
appeared
on
the
--
on
the
list
in
that
particular
year.
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i'll
be
honest
with
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
p.schuler
there
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
can
find
nothing
in
the
statutes
specifically
designated
other
than
the
fact
that
it's
a
general
requirement
of
law
that
the
attorney
general
does
this.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct.
it's
--
it's
not
denied
or
whatsoever.
now,
getting
down
to
--
if
we're
clear
on
the
facts,
the
law
on
the
subject
i
think
can
be
primarily
divided
into
two
categories.
while
the
court
has
not
done
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
freedoms
of
association
cases
are
divided
into
two
categories.
the
first
is
the
--
what
i
call
the
communal
right
to
freedom
of
association
which
is
the
right
not
to
have
to
produce
membership
list
of
an
organization
and
the
second
is
a
personal
right
which
keeps
a
person
from
having
to
give
information
as
to
his
own
personal
affiliations
with
organizations.
the
first
category
of
cases
since
it's
most
appropriate
to
the
matter
here
today
should
be
discussed
first.
there
are
four
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
previously
relevant
to
this
one
field.
now,
bryant
versus
zimmerman,
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
alabama,
bates
versus
little
rock
and
uphaus
versus
wyman.
now,
they're
split
50-50
on
the
effect
of
the
first
amendment
upon
the
production
of
this
list.
both
the
zimmerman
case
and
the
uphaus
case
required
the
production
whereas,
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
the
bates
case
do
not.
however,
i
believe
there's
a
great
distinction
between
the
case
today
and
the
bates
and
alabama
cases.
this
court
decided
in
both
of
those
cases
that
there
was
no
justification
whatsoever
for
the
production
of
the
membership
list.
in
the
alabama
case,
they
said
that
all
the
state
intended
to
prove
by
the
production
of
the
list
under
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
business
that
the
n.a.a.c.p.
had
done
within
the
state.
and
the
n.a.a.c.p.
in
its
answer
admitted
that
it
has
done
that
business.
therefore,
there
was
absolutely
no
necessity
for
the
production
of
the
list
to
prove
something
that
was
admitted
in
the
answer.
the
second
case,
the
bates
case
was
a
local
taxation
statute.
in
this
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.schuler
all
three
of
them
are
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
the
--
those
figures
are
figures
submitted
by
the
n.a.a.c.p.
from
the
national
headquarters.
we
have
no
way
of
verifying
or
--
the
figures
in
any
way.
the
only
figures
we
submitted
were
the
figures
that
were
available
to
us,
the
list
that
had
been
filed
with
the
state.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
p.schuler
there's
no
way
of
telling.
mr.
william
p.schuler
of
the
figures
that
are
available
to
us,
the
membership
did
increase.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
i
think
that
can
be
reconciled
and
that
i
believe
the
n.a.a.c.p.
has
alleged
they
had
40
some
affiliates
within
the
state.
now
--
and
on
the
most
populous
year,
only
11
of
those
affiliates
filed.
what
happened
to
the
membership
of
the
29
affiliates
that
did
not
file,
i'm
in
no
position
to
guess
that
conjecture
or
report
to
this
court.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
understand
that.
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir,
but
i
don't
believe
the
facts
justified
the
decision
of
the
court,
that's
why
i'm
here.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that's
a
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
entirely
correct.
there
was
no
way
--
the
only
contradiction
that
we
were
able
to
achieve
was
that
when
affidavits
were
filed
with
regard
to
specific
happenings.
we
went
out
to
depositions
of
the
parties
therein
and
the
depositions
of
the
parties
showed
that
the
affidavits
filed
were
incorrect
that
they
had
built
up
large
things
out
of
practically
nothing.
the
records
replete
with
the
change
of
the
attitude
of
witnesses
between
an
affidavit
that
they
filed
without
cross-examination
and
what
they
testified
to
when
they're
brought
in,
put
under
oath,
and
under
cross-examination,
asked
questions.
mr.
william
p.schuler
oh,
yes,
sir.
my
brief
certainly
does.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
i
go
into
the
testimony
of
the
various
witnesses.
they
contradict
their
testimony
on
pages
27
through
32
of
my
brief.
this
just
picks
out
excerpts,
but
i
don't
believe
these
excerpts
are
out
of
context.
i
believe
that
out
of
the
record
itself,
you
can
see
that
they
really
show
the
true
attitude
of
the
situation
at
the
time
that
they
could
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor
that
that
is
not
taken
down
in
the
record.
there
was
no
argument
in
the
record
at
all.
actually,
a
lot
of
the
witnesses
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
well,
i
say
we
had
argument
--
oral
argument
on
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
may
i
say
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
we
--
we
charged
that
the
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
we
--
very
--
as
much
as
we
could,
we
attempted
to
controvert
all
testimony
that
had
been
introduced.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
i
didn't
acknowledge
that.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
did
not
acknowledge
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
deny
both.
mr.
william
p.schuler
to
--
to
a
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
it's
hard
to
take
a
definite
position
because
as
this
court
has
held
so
many
times,
you
have
to
weigh
and
balance
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
--
the
particular
effects.
mr.
william
p.schuler
oh,
it's
going
to
have
to
be
balanced.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
it's
relevant.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
that
was
taken
up
with
all
three
judges
and
the
ruling
on
that
was
this
was
only
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
injunction,
that
it
was
only
necessary
that
the
defendant
or
that
the
plaintiffs
herein
show
a
prima
facie
case.
that
if
the
question
of
intimidation
became
a
real
issue
that
we
always
had
the
right
to
go
back
on
the
permanent
injunction
and
try
it
by
oral
testimony.
that's
not
only
the
ruling
on
this
case.
that's
the
ruling
on
every
case
of
this
nature
we
have
tried
in
the
state
for
the
past
five
years.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
that
is
not
only
the
ruling
of
the
court.
it
is
the
rules
of
the
court.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that's
correct.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir,
we
have
not,
your
honor,
because
we
felt
that
even
though
we
were
not
allowed
to
cross-examination
--
cross-examine
the
witnesses
in
the
state
on
the
stand
at
the
time
the
hearing
went
on,
we
went
further,
we
went
out,
went
300
and
somewhat
miles
to
shreveport
to
locate
witnesses
who
made
affidavits
for
the
other
end
of
the
state
and
took
oral
deposition
from
them
and
put
those
in
the
record.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir.
i
say
they
are
taken
solely
by
affidavit.
there's
no
oral
testimony.
mr.
william
p.schuler
unless
it
is
contradicted
in
a
--
other
affidavit
then
the
court
weighs
the
two.
mr.
william
p.schuler
and
affidavits
of
our
own.
mr.
william
p.schuler
no,
sir,
they
do
not.
mr.
william
p.schuler
it
does.
if
this
court
is
--
if
this
court
will
decide
that
the
--
it
is
necessary
to
have
intimidation
in
order
to
have
the
first
amendment
apply
herein.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
think
it's
relevant
then.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
there's
one
other
issue
that
i'd
like
to
get
to
very
quickly.
that
is
the
second
part
of
our
statute
which
requires
that
the
organizations
filed
a
list
of
their
officers.
in
our
state,
there
is
no
requirement
whatsoever
that
these
organizations
register
with
the
state
in
any
matter
shall
perform.
in
other
words,
you
can
start
an
organization,
it
can
operate
and
other
than
this
statute,
you
have
no
idea
who
the
officers
are,
who
the
members
are
or
anything
about
the
organization
whatsoever.
we
feel
that
even
under
all
the
decisions
of
this
court,
including
bates
case
and
alabama
case
that
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
know
who
the
officers
of
the
national
and
affiliate
organizations
are
and
that
this
information
is
not
protected
at
all
by
the
first
amendment
and
a
right
of
association.
mr.
william
p.schuler
the
second
statute,
i
will
get
to
--
that
i
could've
gotten
to
it
a
lot
better
if
we
had
an
interpretation
by
our
own
state
court.
the
local
court
down
in
new
orleans
is,
i
--
i'm
talking
about
the
federal
court,
decided
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
because
it
placed
a
burden
upon
people
in
the
state
of
louisiana
that
they
had
no
way
of
performing,
that
is
tell
what
member
--
what
organizations
other
people
belong
to.
well,
i
think
the
statute
is
susceptible
of
that
interpretation.
i
believe
it's
also
susceptible
of
a
constitutional
interpretation.
the
statute
makes
no
distinction
as
to
who
should
file
the
list.
i
say
if
our
court
had
to
determine
that
statute,
they
would
say
that
the
individuals
who
were
the
officers
of
the
national
association
would
have
to
make
those
affidavits
which
would
in
turn
be
filed
by
the
local
organization
as
a
prerequisite
to
doing
business
in
the
state.
now,
that
would
be
my
interpretation
of
it
and
i
think
it
would
run
right
along
the
lines
of
the
noncommunist
affidavits
that
you
have
to
file
in
order
to
do
business
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
as
i
say,
since
our
state
court
never
had
the
possibility
of
interpreting
the
statute,
that's
only
--
an
interpretation
i
believe
could
be
placed
on
it.
mr.
william
p.schuler
that
is
act
260
of
1958.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
p.schuler
i
believe
the
court
was
a
little
liberal
on
--
with
the
words
of
the
attorney
general.
i
believe
i
argued
that
matter
myself
and
what
i
told
the
court
was
that
there
are
absolutely
no
statutes
similar
or
exactly
similar
to
our
statute
herein
and
that
frankly,
i
just
couldn't
give
them
any
law
to
sustain
the
statute
and
that
i
didn't
care
to
--
that
i
couldn't
argue
it
any
further.
as
i
say,
primarily,
i
was
interested
in
the
other
one.
but
as
i
say,
this
statute,
i
did
not
concede
the
constitutionality
of
it
or
the
unconstitutionality.
in
fact,
i'm
prohibited
by
law
from
so
doing
within
the
state.
mr.
william
p.schuler
yes,
sir,
certainly.
mr.
william
p.schuler
well,
your
honor,
there,
i
would
say,
are
probably
three
answers
to
that.
mr.
william
p.schuler
there
was
such
a
statute
on
the
books.
number
one,
i
believe
it
was
declared
unconstitutional
in
a
previous
court
of
appeal
decision
case,
lsu
--
ludley
versus
louisiana
state
university.
second,
the
statute
has
never
been
enforced
either
before
or
after
the
ludley
decision
and
third
of
all,
unlike
the
school
boards
in
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
well,
your
honor,
as
i
say,
i
believe
it
was
declared
unconstitutional
in
the
ludley
versus
lsu
case.
mr.
william
p.schuler
well
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor
and
may
i
get
to
the
third
point
--
mr.
william
p.schuler
--
unlike
shelton
versus
tucker,
the
teachers
are
not
hired
on
a
yearly
basis.
they
have
teachers'
tenure
and
in
event,
this
tenure
is
attempted
to
be
interrupted.
they
have
a
hearing
before
the
board,
court
proceedings
which
could
eventually
come
all
the
way
up
to
this
court
for
a
determination
of
their
rights
under
this
particular
statute
and
determine
the
constitutionality
thereof.
mr.
william
p.schuler
your
honor,
that
--
all
i'm
doing
on
that
is
attempting
to
ferret
out
the
distinction
between
the
case
of
shelton
versus
tucker
and
the
cases
handed
down
this
monday
with
regard
to
membership
in
the
bar
associations
of
our
various
states.
thank
you,
your
honors.
