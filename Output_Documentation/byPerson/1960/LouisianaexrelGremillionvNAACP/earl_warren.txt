19
when?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1924.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this?
does
the
act
require
all
of
the
fraternal
organizations
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
file
every
masonic
lodge,
every
knights
of
columbus
lodge,
every
elks
lodge,
every
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
take
--
let's
take
lodges
like
the
elks
lodge
and
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
moose
and
eagles
and
lodges
of
that
kind,
do
they
all
comply?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
the
college
fraternities?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
seemed
to
me
with
only
517
registering
in
the
year
1959
that
that
could
hardly
be
so
because
there
were
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
imagine
there
are
many
college
fraternities
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
be
restrained,
if
you
didn't
count
anything
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
act
260
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
that
the
--
from
the
opinion
here
that
the
attorney
general
conceded
that
the
state
was
not
interested
in
pressing
the
argument
as
the
constitutionality
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
thatâ€™s
on
page
130?
chief
justice
earl
warren
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
get
it.
no,
it's
on
129.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
there's
anything
in
the
--
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
this
statement
of
the
attorney
general
to
the
effect
that
it
was
impossible
to
determine
from
the
records
in
his
office,
a
number
of
names
of
defendants
as
which
the
attorney
general
has
brought
action
under
that
act
to
us,
was
because
there
were
so
many
of
them
or
because
there
were
none
or
--
or
what?
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
number
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
ever
heard
of
any
other
prosecutions
or
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
any
evidence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
schuler.
mr.
culligan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
they
generally
complied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
they
--
do
they
require
them
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
true
what
you
say
but
does
every
--
every
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
masonic
lodge,
every
--
every
knights
of
columbus
lodge
to
file
under
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
labor
unions
file,
mr.
culligan?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
exempted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
in
other
words,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
i'd
say
with
either
academic
or
political
discussions.
the
only
type
of
registration
we
have
in
louisiana
on
the
politics
is
of
course
the
standard
registration
as
to
whether
you're
a
republican,
democrat,
or
unaffiliated,
in
order
to
participate
in
party
primers
and
the
only
other
--
only
other
thing
that
i
have
to
--
have
my
name
displayed
to
the
public
is
a
member
of
the
bar
association.
i
don't
belong
to
any
other
organizations.
now,
insofar
as
the
law
is
concerned
in
the
case,
i
like
to
submit
this.
that
the
finding
of
fact,
getting
back
to
the
rules
of
the
--
of
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
or
the
practice
i
should
say
of
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
you
will
find
that
in
the
motion
for
the
new
trial,
i
think
the
very
first
paragraph,
the
motion
for
the
new
trial
tells
the
court
--
we
don't
think
--
we
don't
think
that
their
evaluation
of
those
affidavits
was
correct
and
we
did
ask
for
a
new
trial.
i
don't
know
how
else
we
could
ask
for
it
except
by
way
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
that
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
introduced,
both
by
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendant,
the
court
erroneously
concluded
that
the
members
of
the
naacp
were
intimidated
or
coerced
economically
or
otherwise,
as
a
result
of
their
names
being
published
as
members
of
the
naacp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
--
do
you
particularly
challenge
the
findings
of
the
court
in
your
brief.
i
noticed
in
the
index
that
there
are
three
subheadings.
i
don't
see
it
under
any
of
the
--
those.
i
noticed
that
you
do
show
some
of
the
evidence
of
the
state
in
there,
but
do
you
directly
challenge
the
findings
of
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
you're
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let's
assume
instead
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
the
shoe
on
the
other
foot
when
they
are
unable
to
find
out
whether
there
has
even
been
any
prosecution
against
anyone
ever
in
the
state
under
this
act
when
your
--
when
your
secretary
of
state
certifies
that
--
that
he
cannot
produce
any
such
information?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know.
but
it's
the
attorney
general's
office
and
he
was
in
charge
of
the
litigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
--
the
attorney
general
was
in
charge
of
the
litigation,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
was
the
one
who'd
brought
it,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
he
could've
testified
if
there
had
been
any.
do
you
know
if
there
has
been
any
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
fair
enough.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
not,
sir.
