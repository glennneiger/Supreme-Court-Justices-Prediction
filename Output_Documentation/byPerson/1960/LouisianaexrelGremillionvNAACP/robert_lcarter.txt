mr.
robert
l.carter
if
the
court
please,
i
--
i
think
that
at
least
in
terms
of
--
of
the
interpretation
of
the
facts
that
mr.
schuler
and
i
are
somewhat
at
odds
and
if
--
with
your
permission,
i
will
spend
some
time
in
attempting
to
explain
what
i
concede
to
be
the
facts
in
this
case,
in
respect
to
its
present
posture.
in
1924,
as
mr.
schuler
indicated,
this
statute
which
is
the
membership
filing
statute,
the
old
statute,
was
enacted.
it
apparently
accomplished
this
purpose
and
laid
on
it
until
1956.
in
1956,
the
attorney
general
leblanc
brought
action
in
the
state
court
against
the
n.a.a.c.p.
charging
that
it
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
statute
which
require
the
filing
of
membership
list
and
therefore
that
the
organization
should
be
dissolved.
mr.
robert
l.carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.carter
there
was
no
demand.
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes,
that's
right.
this
--
this
action
was
filed,
there
was
no
demand
that
any
list
to
be
filed,
no
demand
that
there'd
be
any
compliance
with
this
law.
now,
that
statute
--
of
rather
that
case
was
--
was
then
in
the
state
courts
of
east
baton
rouge.
we
filed
a
petition
to
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
court.
while
this
--
we
--
although,
we
had
complied
with
44
--
40
--
1446,
the
state
court
nonetheless,
proceeded
to
hear
the
case
and
to
issue
an
injunction
against
the
operation
of
the
organization.
mr.
robert
l.carter
well,
they
issued
it
against
--
they've
dissolved
all
n.a.a.c.p.
operation
and
functioning
in
the
state,
prohibited
until
we
had
complied
with
the
--
with
the
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
--
with
the
organization.
mr.
robert
l.carter
the
defendants
were
--
were
the
new
york
corporation
and
several
of
the
officers
and
--
and
members
and
--
and
employees
that
worked
in
--
in
louisiana.
mr.
robert
l.carter
well,
there
are
--
doesn't
--
that
there
are
several
branches.
there
about
--
there
were
in
1955,
some
65
branches
which
were
in
new
orleans
and
various
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
they
are
unincorporated
affiliates
of
the
n.a.a.c.p.
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
l.carter
it's
a
--
it's
a
membership
corporation
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
a
new
york
corporation.
mr.
robert
l.carter
no,
sir.
we
do
not
and
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
this
is
conceded.
you
don't
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
we
--
we
do
not
have
to
file
any
or
do
--
do
anything
or
to
do
business
in
louisiana.
mr.
robert
l.carter
that's
right.
in
fact
i,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
i
think
this
is
conceded
in
--
in
the
answer
which
the
attorney
general
had
spoken.
mr.
robert
l.carter
there
is
a
--
an
organization
called
the
--
the
louisiana
state
conference
of
n.a.a.c.p.
branches,
which
is
merely
a
--
an
overall
organization
which
seeks
to
carry
out
on
the
statewide
basis,
the
--
the
activities
of
these
65
branches.
mr.
robert
l.carter
that
none
of
--
none
of
the
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
that's
right.
well,
the
only
corporation
involved
in
the
n.a.a.c.p.
is
the
new
york
corporation.
all
the
other
affiliates
aren't
corporation.
mr.
robert
l.carter
all
the
affiliates.
mr.
robert
l.carter
all
affiliates,
any
kind
of
any
n.a.a.c.p.
activity
was
prohibited
by
this
injunction.
mr.
robert
l.carter
the
suit
was
to
dissolve
them
until
they
had
filed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.carter
that
judgment
was
--
was
declared
void
in
a
--
on
appeal
on
the
grounds
that
it
had
--
it
had
come
after
removal
had
been
affected
and
therefore
was
in
violation
of
1446.
now,
at
that
point,
we
--
we
went
in
--
back
into
the
federal
court
to
seek
to
enjoin
the
state
proceedings
and
the
proceeding
further
with
the
case.
federal
court
indicated
that
it
could
not,
even
though
it
agreed
with
us
that
the
state
had
--
that
the
state
court
was
incorrect.
that
it
could
not
do
anything
about
this,
that
we
had
to
prosecute
in
our
--
our
appeal
into
the
louisiana
courts
in
which
we
did.
now,
after
the
louisiana
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
judgment
was
void
and
what
had
been
done
was
void,
nothing
was
done
about
this
--
this
case
that
had
been
removed.
it
stayed
in
the
courts
until
1958,
this
new
statute
which
required
the
filing
of
affidavits
was
enacted.
mr.
robert
l.carter
--
to
the
court
what
had
occurred
in
the
case.
and
i
think
that
i
got
as
far
as
indicating
that
the
action
which
had
been
brought
under
the
1924
law
in
the
state
court
had
been
declared
void,
at
least
the
injunction
issue.
you
will
note
that
the
--
the
statute
which
is
set
out
in
the
appendix
in
the
appellants'
brief
on
page
--
setting
out
at
page
43
and
44
that
the
district
attorneys
are
permitted
to
bring
action
against
various
organizations
that
violate
the
law.
during
the
period,
therefore,
while
the
injunction
in
1956
had
been
declared
void,
the
various
organizations
and
affiliates
of
the
naacp
in
louisiana
were
fearful
to
function
without
filing
a
list
because
of
section
404.
therefore,
some
of
them
decided
that
in
order
to
function
at
least
at
that
point,
one
of
them
decided
that
in
order
to
function,
it
would
file
a
membership
--
it
would
file
a
list
of
--
of
members.
now,
that
organization
that
did
that
was
in
1956
was
the
new
orleans
branch.
after
1958
or
1957,
i
think
a
few
more
organizations
filed
a
list
of
their
members,
but
it
--
as
mr.
schuler
indicated
only
11
of
65.
the
rest
of
the
organizations
and
affiliates
of
the
--
of
the
naacp
in
louisiana
were
not
functioning
and
were
--
were
not
operating
at
all.
in
1958,
the
second
statute,
which
is
before
the
court,
the
affidavit
statute
was
enacted.
when
it
was
enacted,
we
then
brought
suit
in
the
federal
court
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
statute
requiring
the
affidavit
and
the
old
statute
on
the
grounds
that
they
violated
due
process,
equal
protection
and
the
first
amendment
rights,
insofar
as
they
are
included
in
the
--
in
the
due
process
of
fourteenth
amendment.
that
was
answered,
the
attorney
general
answered
there
and
the
case,
nothing
occurred
until
sometime
in
1959
when
the
attorney
general
then
went
into
the
state
court
and
it
secured
an
injunction
against
the
functioning
and
operation
of
the
--
of
the
organization
on
the
grounds
that
it
had
not
complied
either
with
the
1924
law
or
with
the
1958
law.
at
that
point,
we
sought
to
go
into
the
federal
court
on
the
grounds
that
this
was
a
--
an
interference
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
and
we
sought
an
injunction
to
restrain
the
--
the
attorney
general
from
proceeding
any
further,
since
that
came
out,
it
was
pending
before
the
federal
court
and
the
federal
court
could
handle
and
dispose
of
the
whole
case.
it
was
then
that
the
federal
court
consolidated
the
two
matters
and
had
a
hearing
on
this
case.
now,
if
you
will
note
the
--
the
order
on
the
hearing
indicates
that
the
--
one
of
the
things
was
that
any
information,
evidence
was
to
be
by
disposition.
that’s
set
out
on
page
129
of
the
record.
and
the
federal
court
apparently
was
concerned
about
the
fact
that
how
many
organizations
had
filed
membership
list
and
how
many
prosecutions
had
been
taken
by
the
attorney
general
and
specifically
asked
the
attorney
general
to
give
information
as
to
that.
and
you’ll
note
that
on
page
1
--
130,
the
--
and
129,
the
attorney
general
indicates
that
he
is
unable
to
say
how
many
prosecutions
have
been
brought
under
the
act,
this
is
since
1924.
and
he
is
also
unable
to
indicate
how
many
of
the
organizations
are
affected.
mr.
robert
l.carter
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.carter
i
think
i'm
right,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes.
yes,
'
on
129.
now,
the
affidavits
which
we
think
in
the
evidence
we
have
indicated,
we
have
affidavits
which
show
that
the
--
and
the
most
graphic
illustration
of
this,
i
think,
is
the
affidavit
at
page
119,
showing
clearly
that
there
had
been
a
loss
of
members
--
a
great
loss
of
members,
a
loss
in
units
and
a
loss
in
funds.
for
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.carter
what
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
the
--
the
only
thing
i
can
say
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
he
was
specifically
asked
by
the
court
to
bring
specific
information
as
to
how
many
people,
how
many
organizations
have
you
prosecuted?
now,
he's
--
the
information
he
indicates
is
that
we
cannot
determine
that.
and
i
--
i
--
the
only
thing
i
can
construe
from
that
is
that
there
is
no
--
that
he
is
unable
to
say
anything
other
than
the
naacp
that
--
that
he
has
brought
in
the
action
against
any
other
organization.
certainly,
there
is
no
evidence.
let
me
put
it
this
way
more
positively.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
action
being
brought
against
any
organization
except
--
except
the
appellees.
and
there's
no
that
--
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
for
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.carter
no,
sir.
now,
there
is
also
the
--
the
affidavits
which
are
set
out
on
pages
--
indications
at
pages
60,
118,
122
and
125
for
example,
indicate
that
these
specific
organizations
since
the
1956,
when
the
action
was
--
was
brought
had
declined
in
members.
they've
lost
teachers
and
so
forth.
so
that
i
think
that
the
facts
--
although
these
facts
are
in
--
are
controverted,
that
is
their
affidavits
presented
by
the
--
the
defendant,
showing
that
the
--
that
they
were
not
these
kinds
of
reprisals
and
that
there
were
--
it
was
not
harmful
for
the
organization
to
submit
a
membership
list.
still,
i
think
that
to
weigh
on
the
evidence
as
a
whole
that
the
court
below
had
ample
evidence
in
the
--
in
the
newspaper
reports
and
so
forth,
to
indicate
that
this
--
to
--
to
believe
that
this
was
a
fact.
now,
i
must
say
that
insofar
as
the
question
that
mr.
schuler
has
brought
here
about
the
--
in
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
the
--
the
district
court
rules.
that
is
that
an
objection
being
made
to
the
fact
that
the
--
the
evidence
had
to
be
presented
was
required
to
be
presented
in
affidavit
form
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
question
has
been
raised.
it
seems
to
me
that
as
far
as
i
--
the
record
indicates
that
after
the
temporary
injunction
was
issued
or
rather
before
that
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
for
either
party,
even
we
or
they,
objected
to
the
requirement
that
this
matter
be
presented
in
affidavit
form.
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes,
sir.
it's
a
formal
order
that
it
is
but
there's
no
--
there's
no
evidence
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.carter
well,
i
have
not
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
well,
let
me
--
let
--
let
me
try
to
answer
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
the
--
it
seems
to
be
the
practice
in
that
particular
court
in
louisiana
to
try
these
kinds
of
cases
by
an
--
in
an
affidavit
form.
i
--
this
is
--
seems
to
be
the
practice
of
the
court
on
a
temporary
restraining
order
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
--
affirming
into
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
well,
it's
the
practice
of
that
court,
the
eastern
--
eastern
district,
every
time
i've
been
there
--
well,
this
has
been
what's
occurred.
now,
after
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
and
the
hearings
were
postponed
several
times
in
order
to
permit
the
state
to
get
additional
evidence
and
testimonies,
after
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
or
a
temporary
injunction
was
issued,
the
state
could
have,
it
seems
to
me,
have
indicated
to
the
court
that
we
do
not
believe
that
this
is
an
appropriate
way
for
us
to
determine
this
very
crucial
issue.
and
therefore,
before
there
is
a
permanent
injunction
in
this
matter,
we
would
want
to
have
eye
witnesses
and
testimony
from
persons
to
go
into
the
question
as
to
whether
in
fact
what
has
been
alleged
here
in
the
affidavit
form
was
correct.
mr.
robert
l.carter
that's
right,
sir.
that's
right.
now,
this
was
not
done.
we
of
course
--
we
did
not
appeal
and
the
state
appealed
and
brought
the
matter
here.
now,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
district
court
if
it
had
been
apprised
to
the
fact
that
this
would
--
there
would
be
some
question
in
respect
to
the
validity
of
its
order
by
virtue
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
--
of
the
state
not
being
able
to
prove
its
case
or
to
probe
the
issues,
that
the
district
court
would
not
have
changed
its
practice
and
indicated
if
they
had
been
--
this
issue
had
been
raised.
that
they
--
they
should
have
--
would've
been
able
to
abort
oral
testimony.
mr.
robert
l.carter
if
--
if
this
is
affirmed,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
this
is
affirmed
on
a
temporary
--
in
a
temporary
restraining
order,
a
temporary
injunction
that
the
defendant
still
have
the
opportunity
since
they
have
appealed
it
on
a
temporary
injunction
to
go
back
to
the
--
to
the
district
court
and
indicate
before
a
permanent
orders
issued
that
we
want
to
do
what
they
say
they
now
wish
to
do.
i
don't
think
that
they
are
precluded
from
that
even
if
this
judgment
is
affirmed
at
this
time.
now,
i
think
that
insofar
as
my
own
feeling
is
concerned
that
if
we
get
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
that
is
on
the
membership
list
i
saw
it
in
facts,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
alabama
case
and
by
the
case
from
little
rock.
so
now,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.carter
well,
we
did
not
come
here
raising
an
issue
or
go
in
the
court
below
raising
the
issue
that
these
statutes
were
unconstitutional
on
the
effect
--
on
their
face,
although
i
think
they
are.
we
didn't
raise
it
because
what
occurred
was
that
we
were
concerned
about
the
statute
requiring
us
as
an
organization,
to
file
a
membership
list
and
it's
an
impact
on
us.
and
therefore,
we
asserted
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute
as
it
was
applied
to
us.
now
--
so
that
the
larger
--
larger
issue
was
--
as
far
as
the
--
both
the
state
and
we
are
concerned,
i
don't
believe
it's
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.carter
yes,
sir.
yes
sir,
because
we
have
not
gone
to
this,
the
--
the
--
as
i
understand
the
judgment
below,
the
judgment
below
does
not
hold
that
this
statute
--
that
this
1924
law
is
just
--
is
--
is
bad
completely.
it
holds
that
the
law
is
bad
insofar
as
it
requires
this
organization
to
file
membership
list
and
that
the
1958
law
is
bad
insofar
as
it
requires
the
organization
to
file
the
affidavit.
now,
we
think
that
--
as
i
say
i
have
a
personal
opinion.
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
but
we
did
not
raise
it
and
i
don't
think
it's
the
precedent
before
the
court.
insofar
as
the
1958
law
was
passed,
i
--
is
enacted
--
in
our
judgment,
this
goes
against
all
the
rules
of
--
of
due
process.
the
--
an
individual,
a
member
of
the
organization
--
in
a
local
organization,
an
officer
is
required
to
file
an
affidavit
as
to
somebody
else's
act
and
he
is
punished
if
in
fact
what
someone
else
has
done
over
whom
the
state
has
no
control,
if
he
isn't
indicated
something
that's
incorrect.
now,
one
final
point
and
i
only
make
this
because
the
appellants
have
raised
it
in
their
brief
on
several
occasions
and
mr.
schuler
raised
it
here.
there
seems
to
be
some
feeling
in
the
--
by
the
state
that
the
1924
act
could've
been
interpreted
as
applying
to
us
as
being
applied
to
officers.
i
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
unless
the
court
below
would
require
to
rewrite
the
law,
that
it
could
pick
and
choose.
there
is
nothing
in
this
act.
the
act
says
that
the
membership
--
a
list
of
members
and
officers
shall
be
filed.
the
--
there's
no
separation
here
with
respect
to
anything.
and
what
the
district
court
held
was
that
the
act
could
not
be
applied
to
the
--
this
organization.
now,
what
--
what
i
gather,
the
state
is
apparently
arguing
is
that
the
district
court
could
have
rewritten
the
law
and
have
therefore
state
the
part
of
it
and
said
that
the
law
with
--
could
be
required
to
apply
to
officers.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
can
be
done
here
unless
the
--
the
district
court
goes
into
the
business
of
becoming
the
legislature.
so
this
--
for
this
reason,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
is
we
think,
correct
and
it
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
l.carter
they
were
submitted.
mr.
robert
l.carter
oh
yes,
sir.
they
were
everything
that's
in
this
record
here
was
before
the
court.
they
were
before
the
court,
the
depositions,
the
--
the
affidavits
and
the
depositions
were
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.carter
no,
sir.
and
the
matter
was
postponed.
i
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken
at
the
state's
request
on
--
on
one
or
two
occasions
that
there
were
no
--
no
additional
requests
to
postpone
the
position
of
this
--
asked
by
state.
