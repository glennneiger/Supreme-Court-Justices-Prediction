mr.
m.e.culligan
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
and
i'd
to
first,
express
the
regret
by
our
attorney
general
for
not
being
here
today.
he
just
wasn't
able
to
be
here
and
he
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
or
defendants
in
both
of
these
consolidated
cases.
the
--
person
that
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
is
that
act
2
of
1924
is
not
a
dead
letter
statute
and
was
never
so
considered
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
it
has
never
been
in
a
position
of
being
an
innocuous
destitute
since
1924
to
date.
in
1950,
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
all
of
our
statutes
were
revised
under
legislative
mandate
by
the
louisiana
law
institute
which
is
our
official
body,
the
very
good
features
of
this
statute,
the
deterring
effect
that
it
had
and
cause
increase
in
tranquility
in
our
state
among
everybody
was
so
well
recognized
that
it
was
put
in
back
to
the
revised
statutes
under
its
present
title
of
title
12,
section
401
to
409.
insofar
as
prosecutions
under
the
statute,
i
know
personally
of
no
criminal
prosecutions
or
i've
been
in
the
attorney
general's
office
for
20
years.
i've
never
heard
of
any
criminal
prosecutions
under
this
statute
either
of
a
member
of
the
naacp,
the
ku
klux
klan,
the
st.
vincent
de
paul
or
anybody
else.
i
do
know
as
a
matter
of
my
own
personal
knowledge
--
i
may
be
going
out
of
the
record,
but
i'm
only
trying
to
answer
and
be
informative
to
the
courts.
of
my
own
personal
knowledge,
every
organization
that
came
under
the
provisions
of
this
act
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
ever
called
our
office
in
new
orleans
was
well
told
to
comply
with
the
act
regardless
of
who
they
are.
naacp,
big
brother
fraternities
at
the
colleges,
current
teachers'
organizations,
american
legion,
veterans
of
farmers,
everybody
was
told
to
comply
with
the
act.
now
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes,
up
until
these
recent
suits.
now,
i'll
show
you
as
is
submitted
in
the
brief
of
my
honorable
opponents.
they
will
show
you
that
in
1950
on
page
3
of
their
brief,
their
brief
somewhat
contradicts
their
own
positions.
on
page
5
of
their
brief,
evidence
disclosed
in
the
1950
and
1951,
no
organization
had
filed.
in
1952,
1953,
1954
and
1955,
only
a
few
filed.
now
again,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
you
asked
this
question
and
i'm
answering
it
from
their
brief.
approximately
1000
such
lists
were
filed
in
1956.
so
there
must
have
been
1000
organizations
in
our
state
that
complied
with
1956,
2000
in
1957,
1000
in
1958.
now,
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
you
have
to
file
this
list
no
--
no
earlier
than
december
the
15th
and
no
later
than
december
the
31st,
which
accounts
for
that
drop
of
500
in
1959,
because
the
whole
year
had
not
yet
been
completed
and
there
was
a
no-necessity
and
no-requirement
for
a
filing.
some
organizations
do
file
late.
now,
again,
reading
from
their
own
brief,
"a
total
of
12
naacp
affiliates,"
and
that's
born
out
by
the
record,
"filed
a
list
of
members
with
the
secretary
of
state
in
1957."
that's
after
this
suit
was
filed
back
on
march
1st,
1956.
they're
not
scared
of
anything.
there's
no
fear
of
reprisals.
they're
still
filing
lists,
if
your
honors
please.
they're
basing
this
that
the
whole
thing
is
on
the
fear
of
reprisals,
a
fear
of
prosecution.
there
was
no
such
fear
in
their
minds
at
all.
all
these
came
up
after
1958,
after
the
naacp
placed
this
alabama
case.
and
also
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
there
was
any
announcement.
you
will
find
the
affidavit
of
our
present
attorney
general
on
page
133
of
the
record
that
the
petition
is
herein,
any
branches
affiliated
therewith,
are
the
sole
organizations
in
the
entire
state
that
have
failed
and
refused
to
comply
with
the
law
after
being
advised
that
it
was
necessary
to
so
do.
there
was
no
contradiction
in
this
record
if
that
affirmed
the
positive
statement
of
a
public
official
who
was
supposed
to
be
in
his
doing
his
duty.
there
was
absolutely
no
contradiction
why
affidavit
or
otherwise.
in
addition,
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
a
question
if
there
was
any
reason
given
for
what
you
might
term
a
reactivation
of
this
act.
there
could
be
plenty
of
reasons
for
that,
if
your
honors
please.
right
after
the
brown
case
in
louisiana,
there
was
plenty
of
talk.
that
again
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i'm
only
mentioning
that
in
answer
to
the
question
that
was
prepotently
to
mr.
schuler.
there
was
plenty
of
talk
all
over
the
state
of
the
reactivation
of
the
ku
klux
klan.
that
if
you
don't
make
the
other
points
filed,
why
should
we
file?
now,
as
a
result
of
that
when
the
attorney
general
called
on
the
ku
klux
klan,
there
gained
as
you'll
see
from
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
general,
went
out
of
business.
and
all
we're
trying
to
do
in
the
statute
is
keep
peace
and
tranquility.
we're
not
trying
to
do
anything
else.
we're
not
having
the
exposure
of
a
member
just
for
the
sake
of
exposure.
i
think
our
legislature
is
doing
a
proper
thing.
i
think
out
of
the
police
power
of
our
state,
our
legislature
absolutely
not
only
has
the
right
but
the
duty
to
require
all
of
these
organizations
to
come
out
in
the
open
and
say
who
they
are.
it
is
true
that
when
they
do
that,
it
might
have
an
adverse
effect
on
certain
of
their
membership.
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
think
in
one
of
the
decisions
sometime
ago,
it
has
caused
the
attention,
pardon,
your
honors,
that
in
certain
organizations
men
are
very
proud
to
show
their
membership,
i
belong
to
no
fraternal
orders
and
admire
them
all.
i've
got
a
wonderful
place
and
friends
in
the
masons
and
in
the
knights
of
columbus.
they
wear
their
buttons
on
their
lapel.
they
are
proud
of
their
organization.
they
are
not
afraid
of
reprisals.
i'm
not
afraid
of
my
religion
as
a
reprisal
or
my
politics.
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes.
mr.
m.e.culligan
you
will
find
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
they
do
because
the
knights
of
columbus
generally
are
considered,
although
there
is
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
back
in
1926,
if
i
remember
correct,
sir.
when
the
statute
have
first
been
passed
on
an
inquiry
filed
by
the
st.
vincent
de
paul
organization,
which
is
a
charitable
organization
of
the
catholic
church.
that
they
did
tell
the
st.
vincent
de
paul
organization
which
was
prior
to
my
present
working
for
the
attorney
general,
they
told
them
that
they
had
a
file.
now,
whether
the
masons
and
the
knights
of
columbus
have
filed
that
they
are
not,
i
don't
know,
sir.
because
i've
never
examined
the
list
of
the
particular
organizations
that
they
have
filed,
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
tell
you
whether
the
--
the
--
either
the
knights
of
columbus
(inaudible)
or
the
different
masonic
lodges
throughout
our
state
have
filed.
mr.
m.e.culligan
no,
sir.
they're
exempted
from
the
act.
mr.
m.e.culligan
they're
exempted
from
the
act
because
this
only
applies
to
fraternal,
social
and
literary
societies.
mr.
m.e.culligan
page
183,
sir
of
the
motion
for
the
new
trial.
mr.
m.e.culligan
of
the
fact,
yes.
mr.
m.e.culligan
but
that
i
don't
say
it
directly
in
the
brief.
mr.
m.e.culligan
i
just
don't
say
it
directly
in
the
brief.
if
we
admitted
to
the
findings
sir,
we
couldn't
be
even
in
this
court.
mr.
m.e.culligan
there
was
no
way
in
the
world
that
after
this
affidavit
is
filed
by
naacp
stating
that
there
was
a
drop
in
membership.
without
the
membership
list
which
is
the
whole
crux
of
this
whole
lawsuit.
without
the
membership
list,
how
could
we
deny
it?
we
don't
know,
there's
no
way
us
--
for
us
knowing
and
they
refused
to
give
it
to
us.
so
it
would
be
a
useless,
a
vain
and
useless
proposition
to
try
to
do
anything
about
that.
mr.
m.e.culligan
that's
right,
sir.
in
the
same
way,
we
--
we're
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
m.e.culligan
we
say
that
our
evidence,
just
i
showed,
that
it
was
not
used
coercively
against
them.
it
applies
equally
and
has
been
applied
equally
to
everybody's
--
it's
had
the
same
situation
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes,
that
it
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
i
would
say
that
certain
groups
feel
that
way
about
certain
other
groups.
yes
sir,
even
racial
groups
and
political
groups
and
religious
groups.
in
our
state,
we
haven't
formed
even
geographical
groups.
in
other
words,
i
don't
like
to
make
personal
references,
but
when
i'm
out
in
a
country
parish,
i
don't
like
to
say
i'm
from
the
parish
of
orleans.
i
say
my
wife
is
from
st.gabriel,
louisiana
because
i
would
not
be
probably
accepted
near
as
well.
now,
that's
just
maybe
a
place
in
a
little
local
prejudices
but
that
is
absolutely
a
fact.
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes,
sir.
that's
possible
in
all
--
all
types
of
human
endeavor.
mr.
m.e.culligan
it
could
be.
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes,
but
i
say
that
their
very
argument,
sir,
is
answered
in
their
own
brief.
mr.
m.e.culligan
by
saying
that
in
1956,
right
after
this
suit
was
filed,
they
had
so
many
members.
it
almost
doubled
right
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
where
it
was
given
page
after
page
on
the
front
pages
of
publicity.
it
doubled
in
1957.
mr.
m.e.culligan
well,
maybe
that's
what
the
naacp
stands
for.
it
maybe
a
national
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
--
association
for
courageous
people.
mr.
m.e.culligan
it
might
be
for
cowardly
people
too.
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes,
sir.
i
can
say
it
--
it's
debatable
point,
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.e.culligan
it's
strictly
a
debatable
point,
yes
sir.
mr.
m.e.culligan
well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
pledged
right
that
this
is
an
erroneous
finding
of
fact
to
overrule
the
district
court.
mr.
m.e.culligan
and
we're
saying
that
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes,
and
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
and
that's
why
we're
saying
that.
we
--
we
say
that
the
record
does
show
that
it's
an
erroneous
finding
of
fact.
mr.
m.e.culligan
we
couldn't
do
it
sir,
because
we
don't
have
a
list
of
the
membership,
so
we
have
no
knowledge.
mr.
m.e.culligan
that's
coercible,
but
f
they
put
handcuffs
on
me,
i
can't
--
i
can't
use
my
hands.
and
they've
got
the
handcuffs
on
me
the
minute
that
they
filed
a
suit
by
refusing
to
get
a
membership
list.
mr.
m.e.culligan
i
don't
know,
sir.
frankly,
that's
why
i
am
here
today.
i'm
trying
to
find
the
answer.
mr.
m.e.culligan
if
we
knew
the
answer
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
--
we'd
certainly
comply
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
--
and
try
to
help
out
to
keep
peace
and
tranquility
in
our
state
any
manner,
shape
or
form
that
we
can
do
it.
that's
all
we
are
here
for
and
nothing
else.
mr.
m.e.culligan
well,
if
those
raised,
were
not
be
with
the
secretary
of
state,
sir.
in
other
words,
we
have
64
parishes
in
the
state.
mr.
m.e.culligan
sir?
mr.
m.e.culligan
yes.
mr.
m.e.culligan
the
attorney
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
i'm
telling
you
as
far
as
i
know,
sir.
there
has
never
been
a
criminal
prosecution,
nor
do
i
know
of
any
civil
suit
or
civil
prosecution
that's
ever
been
filed
other
than
these
particular
cases
--
mr.
m.e.culligan
--
which
involved
the
naacp.
mr.
m.e.culligan
that
the
other
organizations
as
is
shown
by
the
affidavit
of
the
attorney
general,
whenever
requested
to
do
so,
they
did
it.
so
there
was
nobody
else
to
file
the
suit
against.
that's
the
only
answer
i
can
make
to
that,
sir.
mr.
m.e.culligan
i
appreciate
being
here
today.
and
if
i
said
anything
that
might
minimize
the
shape
or
form
to
offend
your
honors,
i
apologize.
