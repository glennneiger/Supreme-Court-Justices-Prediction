justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
i
wonder
if
it
troubles
you,
before
you
get
in
to
the
legal
discussion
of
the
state
for
some
particularity.
what
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
is
with
reference
to
which
illegal
doctrines
have
to
be
applied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
facts
of
this
case?
are
there
any
facts
or
just
an
abstract
legal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
all
the
more
important
(inaudible)
to
have
them,
i
should
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
first
statute,
mr.
schuler,
under
the
first
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
the
required
reports
filed
by
organizations.
have
they
been
through
34?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
nobody
has
paid
any
attention
to
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
that
how
it
was
brought
into
being
as
you
call
it
(voice

the
attorneys
of
then
attorney
generals
is
safe
for
now
and
i'm
going
to
enforce
this
and
everybody
should
obey
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suit
against
who
was
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said,
2000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
record
anyway
shows
what
kind
of
organizations
they
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
all
incorporated,
or
a
--
a
membership
organizations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
odd
fellows
have
to
file
one
of
alliance
or
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
noticed
there's
a
great
drought
from
1958
of
--
in
1958
to
1959,
a
number
of
filings
have
cut
into
half.
from
1957
to
1958
was
cut
into
half.
justice
felix
frankfurter
19
--
1900
to
1000,
in
1959,
572.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
1957
to
1958,
two
full
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
was
interrupting
you,
you
may
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
about
what
facts
is
their
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
file
the
untold
list,
did
they
file
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
--
what
is
the
suit
about
then
that
they
shouldn't
be
required
to
file
them
in
the
future?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
it.
this
was
a
dead
letter
until
--
until
the
attorney
general
in
1956
gave
notice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
fairly
on
this
court?
were
the
filings
made
that
year
in
1956
for
1956,
the
next
year,
i'd
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
came
the
decision
of
this
court
and
as
a
result
of
that,
was
it
--
and
one
case
result
of
that
and
at
all
events
following
that,
n.a.a.c.p.
has
refused
to
file?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
(inaudible),
that
is
that
suit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
have
they
all
quit
all
the
affiliates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
didn't
file
any
--
the
result
of
the
1956
announcement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
women's
advisory
are
--
something
like
women's
advisory
committee
obviously.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
either.
i'm
just
drawing
out
of
the
air.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schuler,
when
if
--
if
the
1956
--
the
1956,
there
was
action
taken
by
the
then
attorney
general
fred
leblanc.
when
did
the
present
attorney
general
enter
office?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
the
suit
was
started
by
his
predecessor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
continued
it
and
then
he
--
so
that
the
announcement
really
was
what
you
would
say
the
effective
announcement
by
taking
of
--
by
starting
a
litigation.
so
far
as
the
record
shows
that
justice
black
had
tried
to
elicit,
there
is
no
statement.
no,
no
release
of
whatever
these
modern
terms
are
of
talking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
justice
black
nor
i
would
dress
up
or
dress
down,
i
just
want
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
your
statement
that
an
act
passed
in
1924
laid
dead
on
the
statute
books
of
louisiana.
attorney
general
fred
s.
leblanc
started
the
suit
in
1956,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
we
don't
have
a
deal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schuler,
may
i
ask
you
merely
as
a
historical
fact
carrying
no
innuendo,
just
as
a
historical
fact
if
it's
an
ascertainably
historical
fact.
was
the
klan
a
lively
organization
in
louisiana
between
1924
and
1930s?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
passage
of
the
act
was
so
effective
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
called
it
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i'm
not
--
i'm
--
[laughs]
you
cannot
imagine
how
ignorant
i
am
of
what
took
place
in
--
in
louisiana
between
1924
and
1935
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
our
knowledge
were
limited
to
the
date
of
our
birth,
would
be
awfully
ignorant,
even
more
so
than
we
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
schuler,
why
was
all
these
information
elicited
on
affidavit
from
depositions
rather
than
your
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
all
preliminary
injunction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
must
require
an
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
we
get
on
with
the
cases,
i'd
like
to
go
back
a
little
bit
to
the
fact
that
it's
found
by
the
district
court.
what
do
you
do
with
the
--
there
aren't
specific
finding,
were
there
specific
finding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
will
be
most
--
extract
them
from
the
per
curiam
opinion,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
that
these
three
judges,
two
of
them
your
local
--
louisiana
judges
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
them,
yes,
i
beg
your
pardon,
all
of
them.
page
176
to
179.
they
say
on
page
178,
mr.
schuler,
“the
documentary
evidence
submitted
by
the
n.a.a.c.p.
shows
that
some
members
after
exposure
as
members
have
been
subjected
to
certain
economic
reprisal.”
the
court
going
--
onto
say
that
a
large
part
of
the
membership
of
school
teachers
and
after
the
injunction,
every
one
of
them
resigned
from
the
n.a.a.c.p.
and
the
footnote
says
that
after
the
1955
injunction,
not
only
did
the
branches
declined
a
number
which
might
not
be
significant,
but
the
total
membership
declined
from
13,000
to
6000.
it
doesn't
quite
fit
in
with
the
figures
that
i
gathered
from
you
perhaps
erroneously.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
as
they
contradicted
these
figures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
must
have
done
something
that
those
figures
contradict
--
according
to
your
figures,
you
say
their
membership
increased.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
whether
the
figures
available
to
you
are
figures
of
that
the
n.a.a.c.p.
old
and
the
affiliates
submitted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
the
declarations
against
interest
if
they
contradict
their
own
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
this
that
we've
got
to
decide
which
i
have
to
dispose
of
the
case
on
the
basis
of
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
here's
a
decision
by
three
judges,
locally,
all
of
them
has
been
properly,
like
--
three
--
all
three
them,
local
judges
and
they
give
me
these
findings,
the
practical
purposes
or
the
finding,
as
much
so
as
if
they
had
appendix
1,2,3,
enumerated
set
of
findings.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
contradicts
that
you
say
--
you
say
that
the
court
didn't
allow
you
to
contradict
and
that's
what
in
effect
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
haven't
--
it
was
the
first
time
that
i'm
paging,
thus
leafing
around
and
just
leafing
your
brief.
has
your
brief
set
forth
in
deadly
parallel
columns
or
in
appropriate
way
that
that
the
record
doesn't
--
contradicts
or
at
least,
just
does
not
justify
the
conclusions
of
the
forth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
as
--
as
the
record
--
is
the
state
argued
before
these
three
judges,
before
the
district
court
that
the
only
way
--
the
only
way
to
search
the
accuracy
of
these
allegations
or
affidavits
would
be
to
put
witnesses
on
the
stand
and
have
them
cross-examined
in
the
hearing
of
the
judges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
no
argument
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
you
put
the
point
you've
just
put
to
this
court
that
that
court,
namely
that
this
case
may
well
do.
you
haven't
challenged
the
relevance
of
the
issue
of
discrimination
resulting
from
the
requirement
of
filing
the
report,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
just
answer
that
if
you
--
you
couldn't
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
--
if
--
did
you
deny
the
relevance
--
did
you
say
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
even
as
a
result
of
filing,
they
would
be
discriminated?
do
you
make
that
--
take
that
position
or
do
you
take
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
thereby
acknowledge
the
relevance
of
their
claim
that
this
resulted
in
unfair
discrimination
against
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
the
proof
of
it,
but
the
relevance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
then
you
say
that
even
if
you
could
prove
that
they
were
right
or
prove
that
they
were
wrong,
doesn't
make
any
difference,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
taking
that
position
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
you
is
that
on
a
--
a
factor
to
be
balanced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
then
you
--
then
you
admit
the
relevance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
now,
did
you
then
say
to
the
court
in
an
appropriate
way
that
since
this
is
an
issue
properly
before
the
court,
you
must
have
opportunity
to
disprove
the
establishment
of
that
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
never
mind
all
the
other
cases.
in
this
case,
was
the
ruling
of
the
court
that
for
purposes
of
a
preliminary
injunction,
will
take
as
proof,
allegations
in
an
affidavit.
is
that
the
position
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
formulated
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
then
say,
very
well,
we
will
try
to
show
those
trials
on
the
permanent
injunction?
have
you
made
that
endeavor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
--
let's
see
if
you
and
i
can
come
to
an
issue.
as
i
understand
you,
your
claim
is
that
under
the
rules
of
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana,
claims
made
by
a
plaintiff
seeking
a
temporary
injunction
will
be
taking
as
established
for
purposes
of
granting
the
temporary
injunction.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
in
anything
they
say
in
an
affidavit
will
be
accepted
as
true,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
in
this
case,
you
weren't
in
a
position
to
contradict
except
through
cross-examination
and
examination.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
those
do
not
adequately
enable
you
to
disprove
the
allegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
really,
your
case
down
here
comes
to
the
validity
of
the
district
of
the
eastern
district
to
have
such
a
rule,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said
that
you
yourself
regarded
as
relevant,
as
relevant
that
discrimination
follows
the
disclosure
in
the
report,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
well,
if
it's
an
issue,
it's
relevant
then
you
ought
to
be
allowed
to
--
to
meet
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
n.a.a.c.p.
,
what
kind
of
a
corporation
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
new
york
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
order
to
do
business
in
louisiana,
does
it
have
to
get
a
permission
from
the
circuit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
corporation,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
way
of
connecting
together
these
loose
bodies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
the
suit
to
dissolve
these
collectives
or
to
make
them
file
reports
or
both,
which
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
until
but
the
purpose
was
to
get
filings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
you
at
the
trial
or
did
you
--
were
you
counsel
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
maybe
i
got
the
wrong
impression.
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
i
did,
but
i
got
the
impression
that
mr.
schuler
indicated
that
he
thought
they
were
bound
by
the
local
rules.
i've
looked
up
the
rules
of
that
court.
there
is
no
such
a
requirement,
but
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
i
should
think
neither
the
local
rules,
nor
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
bind
the
district
court
to
try
a
temporary
injunction.
this
was
not
a
restraining
order,
it's
a
temporary
injunction.
nor
does
it
even
require
among
restraining
orders,
just
authorizes.
for
this,
the
district
judge
freeze
the
hearing
of
oral
testimony,
if
necessary.
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
at
any
time
the
state
felt
that
by
being
so
bound
that
is
if
they
must
--
that
to
prove
that
the
--
the
issue
is
to
be
determined
on
affidavits
whether
they
indicated,
that
this
doesn't
enable
them
to
sufficiently
to
undermine
the
allegations
of
affidavits
or
the
assertions
of
affidavits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
we
have
a
record
here,
what
--
what
do
say
to
this,
mr.
carter?
if
in
fact,
dealing
with
this
suit
for
a
temporary
injunction
on
affidavit
precludes
the
proper
exploitation,
the
proper
exposition
of
the
issues
by
affidavit.
then
that's
a
mutilated
way
of
having
a
case
come
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
case
is
here
merely
on
a
decree
of
a
temporary
injunction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
there's
a
--
does
a
corporate
injunction
automatically
enter
if
this
is
affirmed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
other
hand
--
on
the
other
hand,
how
are
they
to
establish
discrimination
or
coercive
consequences
for
the
importance
of
this
act
and
against
them,
except
by
allegations
and
human
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
now
--
and
--
and
if
--
if
their
claim
is
well
founded,
then
you
of
course,
wouldn't
require
them
to
obey
the
law
which
they
say
operates
coercively
against
them
by
making
the
very
disclosures
would
bring
--
which
would
bring
about
those
consequences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
presupposes
that
--
that
the
situation
as
to
all
organizations
is
the
same
in
the
feeling
and
the
attitudes
and
the
relationships
of
everybody
in
louisiana,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well,
can
you
say
that?
can
you
say
that
people
feel
the
same
way
throughout
every
group
of
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
may
be
a
difference
in
the
kind
of
publicity
of
exploitations
of
different
biases
or
inclinations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
that
concept
that
some
other
organizations
might
not
make
out
of
the
case.
if
then,
mr.
schuler
and
i
--
suppose
you
agree,
it
is
relevant
--
it
is
a
relevant
issue
or
a
factor
in
the
ultimate
issue
that
a
particular
of
the
enforcement
of
a
particular
law
operates
with
unfair
adversity
against
the
particular
group.
that
may
happen
in
the
community,
may
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
can't
say
--
i
think
there
was
a
frenchman
who
said,
"there's
no
greater
inequality
than
the
equality
of
unequals."
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
there's
an
--
accession
of
great
courage
during
that
particular
period.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
the
first
(inaudible)
[laughter]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
per
curiam
says
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
are
we
to
do
in
the
per
curiam
when
there
come
three
judges
make
this
kind
of
a
finding
except
--
except
in
the
way
in
which
i've
indicated
to
mr.
schuler
that
you
say
it
was
unfair
to
be
not
to
be
able
to
disprove
the
basis
on
which
they
operated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
it
has
that,
but
in
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
find
that
it's
erroneous,
we
must
go
to
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
record
doesn't
show
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
specifically,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
--
to
point
out
where
the
statement
in
this
per
curiam
that
the
total
membership
in
louisiana
has
declined
from
13,000
to
6000
is
contradicted
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
which
i
suggest
that
you
were
asking
them
to
produce
the
very
thing
which
they
claim,
if
they
did
produce,
would
make
the
offense
of
which
they
complained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
is
your
answer
to
that
dilemma,
while
this
case
has
been
