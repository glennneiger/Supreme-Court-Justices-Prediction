william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
well,
you
--
now
you've
said
they
didn't
file
any.
what
you
said,
because
i
misunderstand
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
filings
by
several
different
companies.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then,
that
--
in
other
words,
the
statute
requires
independent
filings
by
each
of
the
affiliates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
many
affiliates
in
fact
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you

tell
whether
11
is
the
total
number
of
affiliates.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
laid
on
other
than
affiliate
for
the
n.a.a.c.p.
,
your
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
--
no.
i
mean,
are
there
any
n.a.a.c.p.
organizations
besides
the
louisiana
affiliates?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
they
would
be
required
to
file.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
their
member
list
of
--
membership
list
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
have
they
ever
filed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
both?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
locals.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
notice
is
that
a
newspaper
or
something
in
the
record.
i
suppose
that's
the
most
reliable
evidence,
but
this
is
a
newspaper
dated
january
5,
1957.
its
branches
in
new
orleans,
shreveport
and
lake
charles,
filed
this
earlier
to
comply
with
the
1924
state
law
requiring
such
rules
to
uphold
that
national
garden
church
groups.
the
old
law,
originally
aimed
at
the
ku
klux
klan
was
used
last
year
to
outlaw
the
pro
immigration
organization
in
the
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
is
--
is
there
any
suggestion
here
that
this
old
law
was
revived
only
to
require
the
n.a.a.c.p.
to
file?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
they
say
brought
actions,
mr.
carter,
was
there
any
allegation
that
this
failure
followed
a
demand
for
filing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
just
an
action
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
out
of
the
blue
of
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
n.a.a.c.p
of
nothing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
the
state
organization,
mr.
carter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
they
are
branches
of
the
new
york
corporation
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
know
statute
like
the
alabama
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
addition
to
these
65
affiliates,
mr.
carter,
is
there
some
supervening
state
organization?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
injunction
sought
in
the
state
courts
would
have
or
whatever
the
relief
was
by
injunction
or
otherwise,
would've
dissolved
all
of
the
affiliates,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
conference,
state
conference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
is,
then
that
--
that
suggest
the
unconstitutionality
on
their
face
of
both
the
statutes,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
is
why
you
suggest
then
the
state
if
there
were
an
affirmance
here,
might
still
have
a
final
hearing?
