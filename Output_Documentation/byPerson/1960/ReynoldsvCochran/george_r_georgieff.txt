mr.
george
r.
georgieff
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
may
it
please
the
court.
in
essence,
this
question
becomes
one
of
whether
or
not
the
florida
supreme
court,
by
denying
this
man
--
this
man's
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
ruled
in
effect
that
judge
amidon,
by
not
granting
him
an
extension
of
time
to
allow
his
counsel
to
appear
in
court
to
represent
him,
denied
this
man
due
process
such
of
you
--
such
as
you
have
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
with
which
i
don't
take
any
exceptions.
now,
if
it
is
any
more
than
that,
i'm
not
aware
that
it
is.
it
simply
is
the
question
of
the
discretion
used
by
judge
amidon
in
either
allowing
or
not
allowing
this
man's
counsel
to
appear.now,
that
has
to
turn
on
one
thing
and
one
thing
only,
as
i
see
it.
despite
the
existence
of
cash
versus
culver,
mcneal
versus
culver
or
capern,
one
or
the
other
and
chandler
versus
fretag,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
could
have
relied
on
your
decision
in
the
case
of
betts
versus
brady
wherein
this
court
concluded,
albeit
a
number
of
the
members
who
participated
in
that
opinion
are
not
here
today.
there,
you
concluded
in
essence
that
if
it
did
not
result
in
a
fundamental
unfairness
to
deny
counsel
or
to
not
allow
counsel,
that
it
wasn't
such
as
would
cause
a
reversal
of
a
conviction
in
the
state
court
simply
on
that
basis.
that's
my
point
here
today.
if
i
can
demonstrate
to
you
that
what
happened
to
this
man,
as
a
result
of
the
activities
of
the
criminal
court
--
record
of
polk
county,
was
not
any
different
than
what
have
happened
to
him
had
counsel
been
there,
then
i
think
am
free
to
assume
that
i
fully
take
myself
out
of
the
ambit
of
not
only
chandler
versus
fretag
but
also
cash
versus
culver
on
the
--
on
the
status
of
betts
versus
brady,
that
is
to
say
that
you
have
not
yet
reversed
it.
now,
i
think
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
it
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
--
in
betts
versus
brady,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
question
of
denial
of
counsel,
the
appointment
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
of
counsel.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
am
--
it's
true
that
i
can't
place
it
squarely
within
betts
versus
brady
but
i
think,
before
i'm
finished,
i'll
be
able
to
equate
it
with
the
circumstances
in
that
case.
but,
i
think,
in
fairness
to
counsel,
since
he
did
not
argue
any
points
which
he
urged
to
be
included
in
this
record,
that
i
ask
the
court
not
to
consider
any
references
that
i
have
in
my
brief
to
matters
they
hold
the
record.
i
have
made
one
or
two
in
response
to
pleading
by
counsel,
and
i
suggest
now
that
the
court
not
consider
them,
wherever
they
may
appear.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
they
were
in
reference
to
affidavits
executed
by
the
trial
judge
and
by
mr.
laird,
counsel
in
this
case.
i
referred
to
them,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
fair
to
have
you
consider
my
argument
surrounding
those
instances
since
mr.
pepper
has
stated
that
he
is
not
going
to
proceed
on
matters
that
are
not
literally
a
part
of
the
record
before
you
today.
if
the
court
please,
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
which
was
raised
by
the
petitioner,
the
one
that
assails
it
for
the
possible
basis
that
in
its
title,
it
lacks
sufficient
notice
to
the
electors
of
the
state
that
they
did
not
know
what
it
included.
his
answer
was
very
simply
by
the
case
of
baggett
versus
state
at
22
so.2d
for
the
reenactment
of
a
bill
into
law
every
two
years
or
whenever
the
legislature
needs,
cures
the
defect
that
might
exist
in
the
title.
now,
it
doesn't
cure
any
other
constitutional
--
constitutional
defect
except
a
title
one.
that
is
to
say,
when
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
codified
laws
of
the
state,
you
no
longer
rely
on
the
title
for
information,
but
you
do
on
the
codification
by
the
legislature
in
its
adoption
as
a
part
of
the
revised
code.
now,
the
question
about
whether
or
not
this
man
could
have
been
arrested
on
the
basis
of
this,
since
it
does
not
charge
an
offense
as
such,
i
think
this
court
has
held
several
times
that
the
crime
of
--
or
rather,
the
situation
in
which
a
multiple
offender
finds
himself
is
not
one
of
an
offense.
that
is
not
a
crime
and
therefore,
the
position
was
advanced
by
the
petitioner.
since
it
is
not
a
crime,
it
is
impossible
to
charge
it
in
a
warrant
since
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
florida
require
that
a
warrant
specify
the
offense
for
which
a
man
is
sought.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
true,
sir.
in
florida,
he
is
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
is
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
correct,
sir.
and
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
i
say,
by
the
pronouncements
of
775.09
and
775.11,
we
won't
deal
with
775.10
because
that
involves
fourth
offenders
and
it's
not
in
issue
here,
but
775.09
provides,
and
775.11,
the
procedure
which
follows
when
a
man
does
commit
a
second
felony
and
is
proceeded
against,
that
there
shall
not
be
an
information
drawn.
now,
if
we
go
back
to
907.01
in
florida
statutes,
it
provides
that
when
an
indictment
or
an
information
is
returned,
indictment
filed
or
information
returned,
that
a
capias
shall
issue
for
the
arrest
of
the
person,
and
that
is
very
simply
what
happened
here.
the
record
will
reflect,
i
think
on
page
4,
as
filed
in
this
court
that
a
capias
was
issued,
bond
set
at
$5000
and
the
man
was,
as
the
senator
correctly
stated,
picked
up
in
volusia
county,
some
distance
away
from
polk
county
and
brought
back.
now,
the
physical
warrant
or
a
capias
was
not
--
obviously
not
given
to
the
deputy,
but
he
was
picked
up
on
a
hold
order.
that's
done
1000
a
day
throughout
the
country.
i
find
nothing
offensive
in
that
and
of
course,
that
he
was
against
--
that
he
was
brought
in
court
against
his
will,
i'll
cheerfully
concede.
most
of
them
are.
when
he
was
brought
into
court,
he
did
not
suggest
to
the
trial
judge
when
his
case
was
called
for
arraignment,
and
he
was
asked
these
--
these
questions,
whether
or
not
he,
in
fact,
was
the
man
who
was
named
in
this
information
as
having
committed
and
found
guilty
of
and
served
sentences
for
these
other
two
offenses.
he
did
not
say
“i
don't
know
why
my
lawyer
isn't
here,
but
he's
on
his
way”
or
give
some
excuse.
i
contend
that
he,
at
least,
should
have
done
that.
he
should
have
told
the
judge
that
there
was
some
reason
why
the
lawyer
wasn't
there
or
made
it
known
to
him
that
he
was
trying
his
best
to
get
the
man
there
but
couldn't.
now,
in
the
state
of
the
record,
i
can't
do
anything
but
--
but
imagine
or
suppose
what
the
circumstances
were,
but
i
submit
that
if
10
defendants
were
in
that
same
court
that
morning
and
each
one
of
them
asked
for
a
continuance
for
that
purpose,
that
it
would,
of
course,
destroy
any
ability
to
hold
a
trial.
i
don't
know
how
long
it
took
the
lawyer
to
get
there
or
that,
in
fact,
that
he
had
one
except
as
he
says
in
his
brief
or
in
his
petition.
now,
i
submit
that
the
simple
refusal
of
the
court,
even
if
we
accept
all
this
as
true,
to
grant
a
continuance
in
order
for
counsel
to
get
there
is
a
little
different
than
a
denial
of
the
right
to
secure
counsel.
it's
simply
one
in
which
the
court
is
seeking
to
exercise
some
control
over
the
process
which
it
is
about
to
administer.
and
i
don't
think
that
it
is
quite
the
subject
of
condemnation
that
others
have
been
for
similar
areas
but
not
identical.
now,
the
time
limitation
is
it
appears
a
very
serious
question
here,
and
i
don't
know
that
the
court
will
ever
have
to
get
to
it,
i
really
doubt
that
you
will,
but
to
the
extent
that
you
may
find
it
necessary
to
pass
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
is
proper
to
proceed
against
the
man
as
a
multiple
offender
after
he
has
completed
the
service
of
his
second
sentence,
i
will
address
this
for
your
consideration.
i'm
satisfied
that
the
court
is
quite
aware
that
a
number
of
felony
crimes,
not
only
in
the
state
of
florida,
but
as
well
throughout
the
several
states
and
possibly
in
the
federal
system,
are
susceptible
of
a
penalty
which
--
which
includes
nothing
more
than
the
payment
of
a
fine.
now,
let
us
assume
that
a
man
comes
into
court
and
is
charged
with
a
felony
properly
but
in
that
felony
prosecution
and
charge,
there
is
an
alternative
given
to
the
trial
judge.
he
may
either
sentence
the
man
to
penal
servitude
or
he
may
assess
against
him
a
fine.
in
either
case,
the
man
is
guilty
of
a
felony.
it's
only
the
punishment
that
is
allowed
to
be
discretionary.
then,
let
us
say
that
that
man
is
fortunate
enough
to
have
assessed
against
him
the
penalty
of
simply
a
fine.
he
then
proceeds
to
the
clerk
and
pays
his
fine.
i
should
like
to
know
how
we
can
proceed
against
him
as
a
multiple
offender
if
we
can't
do
it
after
that.
we
certainly
can't
do
it
while
he's
doing
it
because
he's
not
serving
anything.
all
he's
doing
is
paying
a
fine.
he
hands
the
money
over
and
gets
a
receipt,
i
understand,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
way
if
the
argument
is
sound
that
we
can
proceed
against
that
man
after
he
had
served
his
sentence
because
that
was
the
only
sentence,
the
fine.
now,
if
the
argument
presented
by
the
petitioner
in
reference
to
this
is
good,
it
ought
to
cover
that
situation
too,
and
i
submit
that
it
does
not.
now,
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
we
do,
under
9
--
915,
chapter
915
florida
statutes
and
chapter
916,
the
first
two
sections
thereof,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
afraid
i
don't
quite
understand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
sir,
i
have
two
remarks
that
i'd
like
to
make
in
response
to
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
first,
the
provisions
for
a
speedy
trial
contemplate
that
it
shall
be
for
a
crime.
second,
they
provide
that
if
you
do
not
move
according
to
the
provisions,
i
believe
it's
916
(1),
i'm
not
certain
but
it
certainly
was
in
chapter
916,
that
it
is
an
affirmative
directive
to
the
defendant
that
he
shall
move
for
a
quick
trial
and
if
it
is
not
done
within
a
certain
number
of
them,
that
is
to
say
three
of
them,
he
must
make
three
motions
that
he'd
be
brought
to
trial
and
if
the
state
does
not
proceed
against
him
or
show
good
cause
why
it
has
not,
then
he
is
forever
discharged.
it
is
not
an
automatic
thing
unless
he
initiates
it.
there
was
one
case
i
can
call
to
mind
that
the
supreme
court
ruled
on
where
29
terms
of
court
had
passed.
there
were
six
a
year,
29
terms
of
court
had
passed.
the
man
was
on
--
out
on
bond,
that
is
different,
of
course,
than
here
but
in
any
case
he
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
secure
any
speedy
trial
until
such
time
as
he
found
himself
in
the
prison.
and
then,
of
course,
he
came
up
and
said,
“well,
look
what
you've
done
to
me.
you
waited
all
this
time.”
the
court
said,
“yes,
but
the
statute
requires
that
you
move
and
request
that
this
trial
be
granted.
if,
in
three
terms,
it
is
not
granted,
you
are
forever
free
unless
good
cause
is
shown.”
so,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
of
speedy
trial
quite
includes
this
situation
since
there
was
no
allegation
made
that
he
did
not
come
within
it
or
rather,
that
he
did
come
within
it,
or
that
his
circumstance
was
one
of
a
crime,
that
is
to
say,
since
this
is
not
offense,
i
must
assume
that
it
is
also
not
a
crime.
it
is
only
a
provision
for
an
enhanced
penalty.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
this
situation?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
of
course,
he
is.
no
question.
but
in
any
case,
as
i
say,
he
made
no
allegation
that
he
felt
within
the
provisions
of
916
and
that
he
did
meet
the
test
set
out
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
for
one
who
complains
about
the
lack
of
a
speedy
trial.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
was
never
raised
in
this
petition.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
statute
so
provides,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
it
does.
i
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
did
he
deny
it?
he
did
not,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
may
i
read
from
his
petition,
i
am
quoting
off
at
page
5,
“the
trial
court
then
proceeded
to
read
off
to
convictions
from
your
petitioner's
record,"
and
then
asked,
"you
are
guilty
of
these
two
convictions,
are
you
not?"
petitioner
saying
"yes,
your
honor,
but
the
court,"
and
then
he
proceeds.
so,
i
cannot
assume
that
he
denied
his
identity
and
therefore,
the
question
of
the
jury
trial,
i
don't
imagine,
comes
into
play
here.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
was
about
to
come
into
that
area.
my
position,
very
simply,
is
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
and
in
response
again
to
the
reply
filed
by
the
petitioner
to
my
brief,
which
i,
of
course,
could
not
respond
to,
i
stated
or
i
will
state
now,
there
was
raised
the
question
of
well,
now,
suppose
he
attacks
the
constitutionality
of
the
entire
statute
or
suppose
he
challenges
his
arrest
or
suppose
he
challenges
the
delay
between
the
tiny
served
his
sentence
or
was
initially
sentenced
at
the
time
of
so-and-so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
is
true
there
may
be
a
host
of
them.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
question
on
that.
i
--
i
can't
imagine
now
what
any
more
would
be.
i
must
assume
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
the
question
of
ex
post
facto,
i
think,
though
it
may
not
have
reached
you
and
had
a
specific
pronouncement
from
you,
it
has
in
florida
in
the
case
of
cross
versus
state.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes
and
for
purposes
of
illumination,
do
let
me
tell
the
court
that
this
statute
is
not
new
by
any
means.
it
was
originally
enacted
in
1927.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'd
be
hard
put
to
figure
just
what
a
man
might
urge
if
he
were
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
take
it
that
that
would
be
an
available
defense.
i
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
satisfied
that
he
could,
if
he
could
demonstrate
that
that
were
so.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
the
case
in
florida,
by
the
way,
i
might
add.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
would
be
less
than
honest
if
i
said
it
wouldn't.
do
let
me
say,
however,
that
in
that
--
in
that
instance,
i
--
i
can
only
contemplate
within
--
within
the
confines
of
what
he
is
confronted
with.
the
information
specifically
set
out
charging
that
these
were
felonies,
that
they
were
convictions
in
a
certain
court,
and
they
can
only
be
that.
in
a
criminal
court
of
record,
they
do
have
joint
jurisdiction
as
to
felonies
with
the
circuit
court
where
there
is
no
criminal
court
of
record.
that
is
to
say,
we
don't
have
criminal
courts
of
record
everywhere
in
the
state.
now,
if
this
were
in
--
in
a
circuit
where
they
did
not
have
any,
the
trial
would
have
been
in
a
circuit
court
where
they
had
only
felony
jurisdiction.
and
i
take
it
that
the
recitation
in
the
charge
that
the
man
was
charged
with
a
felony,
convicted
of
it,
sentenced
to
raiford,
did
serve
his
sentence
would
meet
that
objection
on
its
face
since
all
they
would
have
to
produce
by
the
cases
that
come
within
the
--
come
under
these
sections
is
somebody
who
is
acquainted
with
them,
even
only
the
county
solicitor
or
the
state
attorney
says
“yes,
this
is
the
man
that
i
prosecuted
in
this
court,
and
he
is
and
was
guilty
of
this
felony
and
this
felony.”
so,
i
don't
believe
that
it's
quite
correct
to
say
that
simply
because
you
could
raise
this,
i
think
we
must
consider
how
valid
it
would
be
to
a
defense
under
the
provisions
of
775.09.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
on
--
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
would
be.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
for
instance,
that
the
court
would
interpret
this
statute
to
mean
that
the
only
thing
on
which
he
could
have
a
jury
trial
was
a
question
of
his
identity,
no,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir.
i
need
to
say
that
anything
which
could
be
suggested
is
a
valid
defense
would,
of
course,
entitle
him
to
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
plea
of
not
guilty
would
automatically
give
him
that,
unless
he
wished
to
put
it
in
the
bosom
of
the
court
as
the
trier
of
fact
which,
of
course,
here,
he
didn't
do.
but
it's
my
position
that,
taking
into
consideration
those
things
which
most
likely
would
be
urged
as
a
defense,
and
several
of
them
were
set
out
by
petitioner
in
his
reply
to
my
brief,
i
can
only
conclude
that
with
the
narrow
issue
of
identity,
and
our
court
has
ruled
that
is
a
narrow
issue
in
this
circumstance,
i
don't
believe
that
this
man
has
been
dealt
with
in
a
--
in
a
set
of
circumstances
which
resulted
in
anything
that
might
not
legitimately
have
come
to
him
had
we
observed
everything
that
he
says
we've
failed
to
observer.
i
contend
that
the
arraignment,
the
reading
to
him
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
court
found
him,
that
is
to
say,
that
he
did
in
1922
or
whenever
it
was,
commit
this,
1934
that
is,
then
in
1956,
the
other
one,
and
that
he
had
served
them.
if
he
says
he
is
the
same
man,
the
questions
raised
as
to
the
validity
of
his
search
and
so
on,
i
think,
are
easily
answered
by
the
fact
that
the
provisions
for
charging
somebody
under
this
set
of
circumstances
clearly
provide
and
contemplate
that
you
shall
have
some
means
to
arrest
him
and
that
you
may
proceed
against
him.
now,
i
don't
--
i
don't
feel
that
with
this
narrow
avenue,
that
what
really
has
been
done
against
this
man,
assuming
that
everything
he
says
is
so,
and
of
course,
we
must,
as
i
say,
resulted
in
anything
to
him
which
he
would
not
had
even
if
the
counsel
had
been
present
at
that
time
to
represent
him
in
whatever
measure
he
thought
he
was
capable
of
producing
for
him.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
within
a
day
or
two,
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
of
course,
my
logic
would
be
faulty
if
i
said
there
were
any
limit.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
shouldn't
make
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
to
be
sure,
of
course,
it
could,
but
then,
so
may
many
things.
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
to
stand
before
you
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
and
say
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
since
there
doesn't
seem
to
be,
let
--
i
can
only
answer
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
by
saying,
let
us
assume
that
a
man
has
committed
two
felonies,
not
only
in
foreign
jurisdiction
but
foreign
countries.
and
that
a
number
of
years
transpire,
and
he
becomes
a
problem
in
the
community
and
it
is
discovered
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
might
be
a
little
more
hard
put
to
justify
if
the
span
covered
is
substantial
number
of
years.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
for
whatever
difference
it
may
make,
i
have
no
objection
to
the
coming
legislatures.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
a
bill
pending
before
him
presently
to
reduce
the
time
within
which
they
may
proceed
against
someone
to
two
years
after
the
termination
of
the
sentence
in
the
second
felony.
now,
what's
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
i'll
tell
you
why,
sir.
first,
my
illustration
about
the
fine.
theoretically,
when
the
fine
is
paid,
again,
the
court's
jurisdiction
ends,
yet,
we
can't
proceed
against
him
because
it's
already
over,
if
we
adopt
that
reasoning.
furthermore,
assuming
my
illustration
of
two
convictions
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
and
a
foreign
country,
you
might
vest
a
court,
having
appropriate
jurisdiction
of
those
cases
if
they
were
felonies,
with
jurisdiction
to
impose
the
enhanced
penalty.
so,
if
you
can
get
it
to
him
when
they
never
had
it,
i
don't
think
that
it's
correct
to
say
that
by
the
simple
passage
of
the
sentence,
that
they
have
lost
jurisdiction
to
re-impose
and
enhance
one
on
a
multiple
offender.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
don't
think
i
quite
understand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no
question,
that
the
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
no
question,
of
course,
it's
not.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
and
they
had
to
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
of
course,
he
could
have
raised
even
that
question.
but
as
i
say,
i
hope
to
require
a
backing
away
from
that
by
my
position
on
the
question
of
the
fine
and
the
two
foreign
country
convictions.
now,
i
would
not
hesitate
to
urge
to
my
supreme
court
the
illustration
of
the
fine
because
i
think
it's
proper
and
good,
and
i
don't
believe
that
if
they
could
answer
--
if
they
couldn't
answer
that,
that
they
could,
in
good
conscience,
rule
that
you
had
to
do
it
during
the
time
the
man
was
serving
his
sentence.
and
to
that
end,
i
say
that
it
would
not
be
available
to
them
on
that
basis,
using
that
as
my
argument,
to
say
that
you
must
do
it
within
the
time
that
he's
serving
his
sentence
or
else
you
can't.
now,
as
i
said,
i
don't
know
what
success
the
pending
bill
will
have
when
the
legislature
convenes,
probably
none.
but
in
any
case,
it
is
a
move
on
somebody's
part,
of
course,
to
see
that
these
things
are
drawn
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
and
i
don't
say,
for
one
moment,
that
three
months
is,
five
years
isn't,
but
of
course,
with
each
passage
of
--
with
each
period
of
time,
the
greater
it
gets,
the
more
difficult
it
becomes
to
justify
it
simply
because
of
that
passage
of
time.
but
in
this
situation,
of
course,
it
was
somewhat
under
three
months,
possibly
by
a
few
days,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
activities
against
this
man
were
such
as
would
shock
even
your
conscience
considering
the
narrow
avenues
that
might
be
involved
here.
now,
i
don't
pretend
to
be
able
to
explain
how
many
questions
might
be
raised
by
counsel.
i
rather
imagine
that
if
we
were
to
find
a
country
lawyer
somewhere,
he
might
be
limited
in
his
scope,
and
i
rather
imagine
that
mr.
williams,
who
is
of
some
providence,
would
raise
a
hostel,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
ought
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
what
a
good
lawyer
would
raise
as
opposed
to
what
a
poor
lawyer
would.
just
the
question
of
whether,
within
the
narrow
scope
confined
in
this
avenue,
that
is
to
say,
his
identity
plus
the
normal
defenses
that
are
available
to
anybody,
that
this
man
was
dealt
with
unfairly,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
granting
as
a
petition
for
cert
was
provident
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
the
court
ought
to
receive
from
this
position
initially
taken
here
and
deny
the
cert
granted.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
must,
of
course,
say
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
or
i
cannot
continue.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
a
capsule
version.
i
would
probably
agree
with.
that's
what
it
becomes
and
as
i
stated
in
my
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
let
me
go
further
and
say
that
that
is
a
narrowed
down
version
that
i
won't
argue
with.
i
think
that
it
becomes
probably
a
question
of
just
that.
now,
i
also
stated
in
my
brief,
and
i
will
repeat
here,
that
this
man
has
already,
in
his
presentation
to
the
honorable
gunter
stephenson,
who
was
circuit
judge,
secure
credit
for
his
time.
now,
i
don't
take
any
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
secured
credit
for
the
time
on
his
second
felony.
now,
i
don't
--
i
don't
ask
for
any
particular
kudos
on
this.
all
i
say
is
that
he
presented
an
issue
without
the
benefit
of
counsel
to
a
circuit
judge
which
resulted
in
a
substantial
reduction
at
the
time
which
he
had
to
serve.
now,
he
was
not
ignorant,
not
by
any
means.
he
is
not
ignorant,
not
only
then
but
not
now.
and,
as
i
said
before,
depending
upon
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding,
he
will
have
achieved
at
least
two
victories
out
of
three.
now,
the
only
one
in
which
he's
failed
so
far
is
one
before
the
florida
supreme
court.
and
i
submit
that
that
does
not
demonstrate
that
he
falls
within
that
group
of
people
who
would
have
been
so
harmed
by
this
as
would
require
a
reversal
without
anything
further
to
say
about
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
quite
understand.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
will
agree
that
it
is
a
considerable
problem
and
you
said
it
far
better
than
i
could
serve.
but
at
the
same
time,
i
find
myself
in
the
hopeless
position
of
not
being
able
to
rely
on
a
specific
case
because
it,
too,
embraces
a
specific
set
of
facts
and
yet,
i
can't
urge
a
number
of
things
as
a
deterrent
to
this
court's
ruling
if
this
man
was
dealt
with
unfairly
because,
again,
this
is
a
specific
one,
and
i
--
frankly,
i
don't
know
any
way
out
of
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
trying
to
think
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
without
doing
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i'm
begging
the
justices'
pardon.
i
wonder
if
i
might
decline
to
answer
because
an
intelligent
reply
would
offend
either
my
court
or
yourself,
and
i
would
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
say,
an
intelligent
reply
to
that
might
offend
either
the
supreme
court
of
florida
or
yourself
and
i
don't
want
to
do
that.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
can't
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
have.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
have
read
them,
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
it
is
too
optimistic,
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
it
is
possible
that
they
would,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
admit
that
as
a
very
real
possibility.
i
couldn't
presume
to
say
what
the
court
would
do
of
course.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
and
that
is
the
only
reason
that
i
made
the
remark
which
i
did
prior
to
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
anticipate
that
it's
a
very
real
possibility
of
course.
i
couldn't
deny
what
they've
written
in
these
two
cases.
that
would
be
foolish
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
in
the
two
cash
versus
culvert
cases.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
read
it
quickly
and
thoroughly
and
i'm
well
acquainted
with
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
felt
err
to
elijah
mcneal
which
will
probably
result
in
something
similar
to
it.
so,
i
can
only
say
that
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
an
educated
guess
would
probably
produce
a
yes
reply
to
your
question.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
that
would
be
fair.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no,
sir,
i
don't.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
you
ask
me
did
i
think
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
judgment
of
this
court
rather
than
requiring
that
you
send
it
back.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
said
i
did
not
think
so.
was
that
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
and,
i
said
i
did
not
think
he
was
entitled
to
that
without
it
being
sent
back
because
i'm
satisfied
that
the
ultimate
disposition
of
this
case
will
reveal
that
these
circumstances
are
not
as
represented.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing.
i
thought,
your
honor
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
equated
your
question
with
a
pronouncement
that
your
--
your
disposition
would
result
in
his
immediate
discharge.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
no.
well,
i
mean--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
unless
that
would
preclude
a
showing
that
what
his
allegations
portend
is
not
true,
then
i
say,
of
course,
he
is.
now,
if
you
would
preclude
a
showing
that
what
he
contends
is
not
so,
then
i'd
say,
by
all
means,
no.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
in
other
words,
if
i
--
if
i
may
go
back
to
elijah
mcneal
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
again,
sir,
i
am
put
in
the
almost
hopeless
position
of
not
having
anything
to
urge
in
defense
to
his
allegations.
i
don't
plead
that
as
a
defense
but,
nevertheless,
it
is
a
fact
that
i
can't
avoid.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
yes,
to
be
sure,
because
of
the
denial
without
request
for
return,
etcetera,
or
a
hearing.
now,
in
effect,
all
i
will
say
is
that
whatever
disposition
you
make
of
it,
i
think
that
in
fairness
to
the
state
of
florida,
we
should
be
allowed
to
show
that
this
man
is
or
is
not
telling
the
truth
in
his
petition.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
well,
i
must
say
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
did
not
quite
allege
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
it.
i
said,
even
if
he
wasn't
given
this,
did
he
receive
due
process.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
now,
if
i
said
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
the
time
right
now
to
go
through
it
word
for
word
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
--
and
see
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
but
do
let
me
--
do
let
me
say
that
my
position
very
simply
is,
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
grant
this
man
some
measure
of
relief
or
whatever
measure
of
relief
you
think
which
he's
entitled,
i
think
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
allow
this
--
rather,
to
deny
to
the
state
of
florida
the
right
to
show
that
this
man
possibly
may
be
lying
about
what
he
said.
in
other
words,
let's
assume
that
he
did
not
make
this
pronouncement
to
the
trial
court.
let's
further
assume
that
no
denial
was
ever
affected.let's
further
assume
that
he
never
hired
a
lawyer
or
something
like
that.
i
don't
know
but
what
that's
so
or
that
it
is,
but
if
that
is
possible
determination,
i
think
that,
probably,
we
ought
to
have
a
right
to
make
that
--
make
that
determination
in
a
hearing.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
some
relief,
your
honor.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
i
think
--
i
think
he
is
entitled
to
have
a
determination
of
the
factual
allegations
that
he
made
in
his
petition
before
the
florida
supreme
court
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
there
is
enough
to
them
to
put
that
court
in
a
position
of
requiring
that
testimony
be
taken
to
establish
whether,
in
fact,
these
things
occurred
and
if
they
did,
as
he
suggests,
then
i'm
satisfied
that
the
court
will
rule
as
you
would
if
you
had
it.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
preceded
by
a
return,
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
precisely.
of
course,
we
have
not
yet
held
a
hearing
in
the
mcneal
case.
mr.
daniels
and
myself
--
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
that
is
correct.
and
i
was
about
to
enter
into
that
by
analogy.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
and
it's
my
position
that
that
is
the
relief
to
which
he
is
entitled.
and
we
would,
of
course,
respectfully
suggest
that
the
court,
if
it
elects,
to
find
in
that
vein
that
that'd
be
the
disposition
made
of
it
today.
thank
you.
mr.
george
r.
georgieff
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
