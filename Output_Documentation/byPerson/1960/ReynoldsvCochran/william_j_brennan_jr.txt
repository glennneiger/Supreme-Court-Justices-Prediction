about
three
months
after
he
served
the
sentence,
he
was
picked
up
and
this
happened.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
recognize
any
time
in
it
all,
after
he'd
completed
the
service
of
his
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
this
might
actually
then
be
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
gather,
even
if
it
were
years,
you
recognize
no
constitutional
difficulty.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
speaking
about
this
case,
in
this
case
with
the
very
same
court
in
which
he
had
previously
been
convicted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
hard
to
justify
on
constitutional
grounds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
in
--
in
this
case,
might
that
not
be
a
state
law
question
in
this
very
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
might
that
not
still
be
something
which
the
--
your
supreme
court
might
say
is
the
way
this
statute
is
to
be
constituted,
namely,
that
this
court
had,
in
fact,
in
this
circumstance,
lost
jurisdiction
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
under
your
own
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
foreclosed,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
a
lawyer
--
a
lawyer
might
have
been
very
useful
to
him
to
raise
that
question,
is
it
not?
