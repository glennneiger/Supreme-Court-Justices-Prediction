mr.
claude
pepper
--
habitual
offender
of
the
statute.
now,
the
reason
i
say
that
it
appears
that
the
florida
supreme
court
has
not
decided
the
question
is
this.
in
the
subsequent
case
of
milan
versus
the
state,
a
florida
case
in
1958,
when
that
question
was
presented,
then
the
court
erred
--
as
to
the
second
question,
their
supreme
court
had
said
--
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
florida
held
that
the
general
statutes
of
limitations
barred
prosecution
for
an
offense.
now,
here
is
the
language
of
the
court,
"the
first
of
the
above
questions,"
as
quote,
"is
not
before
the
court
because
there
is
no
showing
that
appellant
had
actually
said
his
entire
sentence
for
the
second
offense,
before
the
amended
information
was
filed,
charging
him
with
being
a
second
offender."
on
this
question,
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
members
of
the
court
but
as
it
is
not
right
for
determination
under
the
record
here,
no
useful
purpose
could
be
served
by
discussing
it.
now,
what
our
suggestion
want
to
do
that
the
florida
supreme
court
in
that
later
case,
indicating
that
they
didn't
decide
this
question
because
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
justices
of
the
court,
this
court
might
well
apply
the
doctrine
that
where
the
state
supreme
court
has
not
made
an
authoritative
interpretation
of
a
statute,
this
court,
when
the
matter
is
properly
before
it,
may
place
its
own
interpretation
upon
the
statute
which
in
this
case,
to
avoid
the
question
of
unconstitutionality
on
the
ground
of
not
observing
due
process,
would
require
the
court
to
construe
the
statute
to
mean
as
the
court,
in
the
nelson
case
indicated,
it
might
have
been
intended
to
mean
that
it
only
gave
jurisdiction
to
the
court
after
a
man
had
begun
the
service
of
his
sentence
or
after
the
expiration
of
a
term.
but
they
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
apply
to
a
case
where
a
man
had
completed
his
service
of
the
felony
sentence
and
was
free
without
any
previous
notice,
without
any
concealment
or
without
any
conduct
on
his
part
that
deterred
the
state
from
--
from
bringing
him
within
the
encompass
of
the
habitual
offender
statute.
so
i'm
saying,
your
honors,
is
that
i
would
be
grateful
if
the
court
would
take
into
account
and
keep
in
mind
that
if
you
construe
the
statute
that
way,
then,
unless
they've
got
some
other
authority
upon
which
to
hold
a
man,
this
statute
would
not
be
a
sufficient
ground
for
his
incarceration.
if
they've
got
other
grounds,
of
course,
alright,
let
that
appear.
alright,
and
to
avoid
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
would
raise
a
serious
question
of
due
process
as
to
whether
it
could
apply
in
case
the
state
had
sat
by
with
no
fault,
at
least
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
and
allowed
him
to
serve
his
sentence,
get
credit
for
his
good
time,
become
presumably
good
citizen
again,
and
then
be,
once
more,
apprehended
and
incarcerated.
now,
add
all
of
these,
if
you
can
do
it
in
one
instance,
in
this
case,
he
had
two
years
and
he
served,
let's
say,
one
and
three-quarter
years.
he
--
the
judge
could
have
given
him
10
years.
then,
if
what
i
say
is
not
substantially
true,
your
honor,
what
would
prevent
the
court
from
the
first
time
he
was
apprehended
under
the
habitual
offender
statute
to
say,
“alright,
i'll
give
you
three
years
this
time.”
he
goes
and
serves
the
three
years.
then,
he
gets
out
and
goes
about
his
business
and
five
years
later,
they're
bringing
him
in
again
and
give
him
some
more
years.
and
he
goes
and
serves
again
and
they
wait
20
years
and
bring
him
up
again
and
he
serves
some
more
time.
if
there's
not
some
constitutional
principle,
there's
no
statutory
prohibition
here
in
this
act
against
the
court
waiting
50
years
after
he
had
finished
the
service
of
the
felony
sentence
for
which
he
was
sentenced
and
then
bringing
him
back
again,
after
he's
lived
with
family
and
lived
an
honorable
life,
and
incarcerating
him
again
for
having
been
a
habitual
offender.
i
hope
it
may
be
within
the
scope
of
--
of
this
case,
in
the
court's
review
of
it,
to
consider
those
questions,
as
well
as
the
counsel's
questions.
thank
you.
mr.
claude
pepper
your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
claude
pepper
--
there's
only
a
word
or
two
more
that
--
that
i've
been
asked.
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
brought
up,
and
i
think
i
have
about
six
or
seven
minutes,
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
exceed.
mr.
claude
pepper
oh,
thank
you.
mr.
claude
pepper
thank
you.
one
of
the
reasons
i
brought
up
this
question
about
due
process
in
a
case
where
the
defendant
had
completed
the
service
of
his
previous
sentence
was
that
if
the
record
should
show
those
facts
here,
and
i
suppose
there's
no
dispute
whatever
about
the
man
having
completed
the
service
of
the
sentence
for
which
he
was
charged,
that
is,
the
grand
larceny
charge.
now,
if
under
these
facts,
there
wouldn't
be
any
justification
for
charging
this
man
again.
well,
then
it
would
seem
to
be
rather
useless
to
go
all
the
way
even
to
the
supreme
court
and
let
alone,
to
back
to
the
court
of
--
criminal
court
of
record
of
polk
county
for
--
for
the
decision
of
this
matter
again
because
that's
not,
so
far
as
i
assume,
a
factual
issue.
i
don't
think
the
state
would
dispute
the
fact
that
the
man
had
already
completed
his
service
of
the
grand
larceny
sentence.
now,
if
that
type,
being
assumed,
would
make
it
a
violation
of
due
process
to
apprehend
him
again
after
the
completion
of
that
sentence,
then
i
thought
that
matter
might
well
be
within
the
scope
of
the
consideration
of
this
matter
by
this
honorable
court.
on
the
other
points,
your
honor,
this
court
said
through
the
able
chief
justice
in
the
fretag
case,
of
course,
regardless
of
whether
petitioner
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
appointment
of
counsel,
his
right
to
be
heard
through
his
own
counsel
was
unqualified.
and
i
rather
input
from
the
brief
of
the
state
as
the
chief
justice
did,
that
the
--
the
state
was
taking
the
position
that
because
there
wasn't
any
effective
defense
that
an
attorney
could
have
presented
in
the
court
that
sentenced
this
man
under
the
habitual
offender
statute
that,
therefore,
he
had
suffered
no
harm,
and
there
wasn't
any
--
anything
that
--
that
need
be
done
for
him
here.
i
would
simply
say,
in
my
reference
to
the
--
to
the
two
cash
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
after
the
--
the
cash-culvert
decision
by
this
honorable
court.
why
did
that
court,
evidently
having
ignored
the
principle
of
cash
versus
culvert
decided
by
this
court
in
this
case,
september
the
15th,
1959,
five
months
after
the
cash-culvert
decision
by
this
case,
in
another
case
and
where
counsel
were
present
and
where
a
due
consideration
was
given
to
the
matter,
had
now
affirmed
the
principle
of
cash
versus
culvert
and
of
--
and
of
chandler
versus
fretag
as
the
doctrines
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
they
will
apply.
but
i
didn't
mean,
in
any
manner,
to
suggest
that
the
--
that
this
man
should
be
left
to
the
speculation
by
this
court
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
might
decide
because
the
--
the
cash-fre
--
the
cash-culvert
case
had
already
been
decided
by
this
court
and
in
the
--
in
the
books,
four
or
five
months
prior
to
the
time
the
supreme
court
of
florida
denied
this
petition,
presumably
in
the
light
of
those
second
and
third
of
that
--
second
and
third
cash
cases,
they
would
so
hold
but,
certainly,
as
the
chief
justice
had
intimated,
this
case
is
before
this
honorable
court.
and
i
would
take
it,
if
the
principle
is
right
that
due
process
was
denied
by
the
denial
of
counsel,
that
it
would
be
proper
to
--
to
grant
this
certiorari
so
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
will
do
what
it
did
in
--
under
the
cash
versus
culvert
decision
of
this
court,
say
that
it
was
under
the
mandate
of
this
court
to
issue
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
i
add
only,
in
respect
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
the
statute,
in
respect
to
the
man's
saying
that
he
was
the
same
person
as
convicted
under
the
previous
conviction,
the
statute
says,
“if
the
jury
finds
that
he
is
the
same
person
or
if
he
acknowledges
or
confesses
in
open
court
after
being
duly
cautioned
as
to
his
rights,
that
he
is
the
same
person.”
and
the
record
of
this
judgment
is
silent
here
as
to
his
being
informed
about
any
right
that
he
possessed,
let
alone
the
right
to
a
jury,
the
right
to
question
whether
the
identity
existed
or
not
or
any
other
point
that
may
--
that
may
have
been
raised.
mr.
claude
pepper
and
the
last
--
mr.
claude
pepper
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
claude
pepper
i
--
i
find
it
so.
and
the
--
but
the
defendant
finds
it
particularly
so,
your
honor.
they
--
i'll
end
it
only
this
last
thing
and
that
is
that
we,
in
our
brief,
did
attempt
to
set
out
the
--
the
various
points
other
than
those
that
have
been
mentioned
here,
that
counsel
could
have
brought
up.
of
course,
it's
an
unqualified
right
to
have
your
own
counsel
if
you
can
afford
it.
but
nevertheless,
we
pointed
out
a
number
of
--
of
things
that
an
attorney
could
have
done.
mr.
justice
douglas
called
attention
to
some
and
other
of
the
justices
or
the
chief
justice
had
called
attention
to
others.
we
could
well
have
contended
--
any
competent
lawyer
would
have
contended
to
the
court
that
in
the
light
of
the
nelson
case
and
the
milan
case,
that
the
florida
supreme
court
had
never
determined
whether
or
not
their
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to
a
case
where
the
last
sentence
had
already
been
served.
that
could
well
have
been
argued
and
should
have
been
considered
and
passed
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
constitutionality
that
i
--
i
would
have
had
much
to
have
said
in
reply
to
what
counsel
for
the
states
had
amended
ago,
that
under
our
statute,
only
one
subject
under
our
constitution
in
regard
to
legislation,
only
one
subject
can
be
dealt
within
a
statute
and
that
subject
has
to
be
clearly
expressed
in
the
title.
and
here,
in
view
of
the
law
of
florida,
that
once
the
court's
term
had
expired
or
once
the
defendant
had
entered
upon
the
service
of
the
sentence,
the
court
then
lost
jurisdiction.
it's
grievously
doubtful
as
to
whether
or
not
a
legislator
would
have
been
informed
in
passing
upon
this
habitual
offender
statute
that
it
meant
to
create
new
jurisdiction
in
courts
not
only
after
the
term
had
expired
or
after
the
man
had
begun
the
service
of
his
sentence,
but
it
meant
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction
for
an
indefinite
time
after
he
had
completed
the
service
of
his
sentence.
i
can
well
imagine
that
legislators
might
have
had
entirely
different
opinions
about
that
aspect
of
the
matter
of
which
they
had
no
advice
in
the
title
of
the
statute
if
they
were
entitled
to
have
under
the
provisions
of
our
constitution.
i
could
multiply
instances,
of
course,
if
i
knew
my
time.
mr.
claude
pepper
no,
your
honor.
mr.
claude
pepper
the
record
is
silent.
it
merely
says
that
--
that
the
--
he
--
he
got
out
about
the
1st
of
december
and
then
on
--
the
record
shows
then
that
on
the
13th,
the
county
solicitor
filed
this
information
and
while
i
don't
see
it
in
there,
counsel
has
stated
in
his
brief
that
on
the
back
side
of
it,
it
appears
that
on
the
15th,
it
was
served.
and
the
record
then
shows
that
on
the
18th,
the
--
the
defendant
was
picked
up
by
this
pickup
order
which
wasn't
a
warrant,
and
that's
another
point
that
we've
called
attention
to
in
our
brief.
mr.
claude
pepper
it's
whether
he
was
properly
picked
up
or
apprehended
under
our
law.
but
it
just
shows
that
he
was
apprehended
under
this
pickup
order
to
be
carried
down
there
to
the
--
to
the
court.
and
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
nothing
to
explain
why
they
waited
more
than
two
years
to
discover
a
conviction
that
have
been
rendered
in
this
very
court
against
--
mr.
claude
pepper
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
so.
and
by
the
way,
this
man,
in
his
petition,
refers
to
the
case
of
patch
versus
state.
i
believe
it
is
patch
versus,
i
think,
it's
state
or
patch
versus
(inaudible).
they
tell
me
that
down
at
the
state
prison,
they
have
what
they
call
a
prisoner's
library
when
they
passed
around
these
pleadings.
that's
the
reason
sometimes,
in
a
--
in
the
petition
of
a
man
like
this,
you
will
find
some
good
phrasing
then
you
will
find
him
saying
some
things
that
are
utterly
ungrammatical
at
all.
i
suspect
that
maybe,
possibly,
he
copied
something
that
he
picked
up,
and
i
don't
think
it
shows
you
that
this
man
was
an
able
man,
so
far
as
that's
concerned
or
--
or
an
informed
man.
but
nevertheless,
in
that
patch
case,
the
florida
supreme
court
considered
the
practice
that
has
prevailed
by
the
courts
of
florida
for
quite
a
long
while
and
condemn
the
practice
and
--
and
require
the
--
the
determination
of
the
practice,
that
is,
that
after
a
man
was
convicted,
the
court
would
just
indefinitely
withhold
sentence
and
sometimes
that
withholding
went
on
for
years.
a
man
would
be
subject
any
time
to
be
brought
back
and
--
and
sent
to
prison
under
a
sentence
he'd
been
convicted
by
a
jury,
let's
say,
but
instead
of
a
sentence
being
imposed
within
a
reasonable
time,
the
court
would
just
put
him
on
probation,
as
it
were,
by
just
not
imposing
a
sentence,
by
holding
it
in
the
bosom
of
the
court.
well,
now,
the
florida
supreme
court
pointed
out
that
--
and
this
man
said,
“does
a
man
never
to
know
in
substance
when
he's
subject
to
be
called
back
and
incarcerated
in
prison
as
it
were?
does
he
have
no
certainty
about
his
liberty
and
that
sort
of
thing?”
so,
the
florida
supreme
court
laid
down
a
principle
which
i
think
might,
under
due
process,
apply
to
the
length
of
time
in
which
these
charges
of
being
a
habitual
offender
might
be
presented.
the
court
said
unless
there's
some
real
justifiable
reason
for
the
court
withholding
the
imposition
of
a
sentence,
like
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
a
motion
and
a
rest
of
judgment
or
for
some
other
reason,
it
would
be
a
normal
as
--
just
as
indicated
this
morning
in
another
case.
should
--
should
we
hold
it
for
this
reason
or
there's
some
real
justifiable
reason.
why,
it's
a
duty
of
the
court
to
impose
whatever
sentence
he's
going
to
impose,
give
the
man
a
right
of
appeal.
you
can't
appeal
from
a
sentence
that's
never
been
imposed.
you've
got
to
have
a
final
judgment
before
you
can
appeal.
give
the
man
a
chance
to
appeal
or
to
move
for
