chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
georgieff.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
betts
versus
brady
have
to
do
with
a
man
having
a
right
to
be
represented
by
his
own
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
though
--
well,
that's
what
this
case
is,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
doesn't
that
depend
upon
the
statute
of
the
particular
state?
in
some
states,
i
think,
habitual
offender
is
being
charged
with
another
crime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
is
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
supreme
court
has
held
that,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
a
speedy
--
speedy
trial
provision
in
your
constitution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
equate
this
situation
to
that
provision?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
here,
you
have
--
have
a
situation
where
--
where
a
man
has
not
been
charged
for
two
years
or
more,
and
after
he
has
served
his
time
for
the
offense,
he
was
originally
charged
with,
how
--
how
can
you
say
that
he
has
a
speedy
trial
in
this
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he's
entitled
to
--
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
isn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
he
--
suppose
his
defense
was
that
one
of
these
was
not
a
felony
in
some
states,
for
instance,
the
crime
of
forgery.
if
in
only
small
amounts,
it's
punishable
by
either
term
in
the
penitentiary
or
by
term
in
the
county
jail
and
if
county
jail
sentence
is
given,
it
does
not
constitute
a
felony
in
that
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
--
i
suppose
when
you're
dealing
with
the
laws
of
the
various
states
of
the
union,
that
would
--
that
might
be
a
very
--
very
obvious
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
justice
whittaker
read
the
statute
in
which
it
says
that
if
he
does
not
admit
his
identity,
he's
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
suppose
he
said,
“yes,
i'm
the
man
who
is
mentioned
in
those
two
--
those
two
convictions,
but
i
have
a
defense
and
--
and
i
want
to
contest
whether
i'm
a
habitual
offender
or
not.”
is
he
then
entitled
to
a
--
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
i
wanted
to
ask.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
--
this
man
is
in
jail
and
he's
been
in
jail
a
long
time,
and
he's
properly
here
before
this
court,
don't
you
believe
that,
in
view
of
those
circumstances,
he's
entitled
to
a
judgment
of
this
court
without
remanding
it
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
for
him
to
wait
in
jail
maybe
another
year
or
two
before
he
can
have
his
case
judged
by
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that's
equitable
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
therefore,
he
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
hadn't
made
any
such
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
suggestion.
i
was
talking
about
what
he
is
here
before
us
and
properly
here
before
us,
and
--
and
is
he
--
is
he
not
entitled
to
whatever
judgment
he's
entitled
to
under
the
facts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i'm
a
little
confused
because
we're
dealing
with
parables
about
what
the
--
what
the
court
will
do
and
what
it
won't
do
and
what
it
might
do
and
so
forth.
i
--
i
get
confused
on
it.i
just
wonder
if
this
man
isn't
properly
here
before
this
court
and
entitled
to
the
judgment
of
this
court,
whatever
that
--
whatever
that
might
be,
based
upon
the
merits
of
his
--
his
case
here
today.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
why
he's
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
your
--
the
major
portion
of
your
argument
was
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
any
relief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
wasn't
even
entitled
to
go
back
that
--
then
have
a
hearing
now.
you
can
(inaudible)
and
keep
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
got
everything
in
that
court
that
he
was
entitled
to,
that
a
lawyer
couldn't
have
done
him
any
good
and
that,
therefore,
he
wasn't
entitled
to
any
remedy
at
our
hands.
maybe
i
--
maybe
i
didn't
quite
understand
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
i
don't
want
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
want
to
argue
with
you
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
contend
that
he
is
entitled
to
no
relief.
now,
i
look
at
your
conclusion
of
your
brief
and
you
say
"wherefore
it
appears
almost
conclusively
that
no
rights
assured
petitioner
by
either
federal
or
florida
law
were
denied
him
the
proceedings
about
which
petitioner
complains
did
no
violence
to
his
liberty,
which
has
not
been
recognized
as
valid
and
lawful
in
every
pertinent
way.
it
follows
that
the
certiorari
should,
therefore,
be
denied."
now,
is
that
your
present
position?
do
you
believe
we
should
deny
this
writ
or
--
or
do
you
believe
he's
entitled
to
some
relief
and
if
so,
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
relief
would
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
your
position
is
that
he's
entitled
to
the
hearing
that
was
denied
him
by
the
florida
courts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pepper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
you
have
--
you
have
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
senator
pepper,
on
--
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
the
very
vigorous
manner
in
which
you
have
defended
the
rights
of
this
indigent
person.
we're
always
comforted
when
lawyers
like
yourself
are
willing
to
take
assignments
of
this
--
of
this
kind,
and
we
do
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
georgieff
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
want
to
say
to
you,
sir,
that
we
likewise
appreciate
the
frank
and
able
and
diligent
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
interest
of
your
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
given
us
a
good
presentation
of
the
case,
both
of
you.
