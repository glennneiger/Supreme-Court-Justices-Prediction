are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying,
mr.
georgieff,
that
the
judge,
in
denying
his
request,
made
an
estimate
of
the
situation
in
which
the
prisoner
found
himself
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that
such
an
estimate
was
a
justifiable
estimate
which
didn't
cut
off
any
potential
opportunities
for
the
prisoner
as
against
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
of
embarrassment
to
the
administration
of
justice
by
granting
this
continuance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
case
gets
down
to,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what's
lacking?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
isn't
in
the
capsule?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can't
deal
with
a
group
of
people
here.
we
have
a
particular
--
a
case,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
circumstances.
this
isn't
the
validity
of
a
statute
which
is
a
net
which
involves
--
which,
in
effect,
is
a
net
of
such
--
such
type
of
composu
--
composition
that
it
sweeps
within
it,
that
it
hauls
up
all
sorts
of
thing.
this
is
a
particular,
a
particular
record
of
the
particular
circumstances
you
say
and
therefore,
judicial
mind
isn't
--
shouldn't
be
invited
to
roam
at
large
and
think
of
all
the
fanciful
possibilities
that
this
prisoner
may
have
been
able
to
dredge
up
if
he'd
had
mr.
bennett
williams
or
his
counterpart
in
--
in
florida.
i
mean,
is
that
clear?
i'm
not
saying
that's
the
answer
to
the
case.
i'm
stating
a
problem,
not
a
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
do
you
say
to
the
suggestion
that
--
that
in
light
of
the
attitude
of
your
supreme
court
in
the
later
--
in
the
two
later
cash
cases,
if
this
matter
were
remanded
to
that
court
to
be
reexamined
not
only
in
the
light
of
our
pre-docket
case
but
what
they
reveal
to
be
the
--
their
view
of
the
law,
you
might
have
a
different
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
as
a
matter
of
--
i
don't
mean
as
a
matter
of
mercy
or
grace,
but
they've
now
laid
down
in
100
cases.
the
court
said,
at
the
property
of
this,
they've
--
they've
laid
down
a
new,
call
it
what
you
will,
a
new
attitude
by
which
a
new
point
of
view,
new
consideration
or
consideration
that's
not
heretofore
applied
to
a
situation
not
that
similar
and
therefore,
in
a
way
--
he
hasn't
put
it
in
those
words
but
implicitly,
in
a
way,
what's
his
name,
reynolds
is
the
victim
of
the
unequal
protection
of
the
laws
and
that
he
came
before
them
in
1959
instead
of
early
in
1960.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
be
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
question
of
--
i
haven't
read
the
opinion
and
i
--
i
assume
you
have.
if
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
you're
able
to
tell
whether
senator
pepper
has
put
too
optimistic
an
interpretation
on
the
later
cash
cases.
if
you
--
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
his
view
of
those
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
--
if
--
if
i
may
interpret
that
more
pointedly
by
saying
you
think
if
judge
--
that
judge
by
those
cases,
they
would
have
been
--
he
was
entitled
to
have
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
aren't
you
saying,
in
effect,
that
under
the
law,
as
we
now
have
it
declared
by
the
highest
court
of
florida,
a
situation
has
arisen
which
makes
a
change
in
the
outcome
which
may
reasonably
have
made
a
--
may
reasonably
make
a
change
if
the
case
was
sent
back
in
the
outcome
of
the
case
and
therefore,
there
comes
into
play
a
well-known
doctrine
that
an
intervening
event
may
change
the
course
of
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
that's
--
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
answered
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
nor
can
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
anybody
--
that's
imprint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
mean
to
elicit
a
prophecy
from
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
given
the
answers
that
seem
to
me
vital
to
a
judgment,
namely,
whether
it
is
true,
as
a
matter
of
fair
interpretation
of
the
latest
pronouncement
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
that
their
pronouncements
which,
as
it
were,
if
acted
upon
this
case,
undercut
the
--
the
unexpressed,
inarticulate
basis
of
this
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
gather
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
gather
from
you
that
you
think
the
florida
supreme
court
finds
a
mandate
from
this
court
helpful.
