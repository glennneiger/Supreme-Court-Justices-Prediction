mr.
dan
winn
if
the
court
please.
if
i
can
take
the
--
an
issue
of
moments
of
this
time
to
try
to
narrow
the
issues
of
this
case
before
the
court,
i
think
that
your
honors
have
been
able
to
see
that
basically,
there
is
only
one
constitutional
question
before
this
court
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
code
6
in
38-415
of
the
georgia
code
allowing
the
unsworn
statement.
now,
i
will,
later
in
my
argument,
see
why
i
believe
that
is
the
only
question,
but
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
or
two
inaccuracies
that
i
feel
have
been
presented
to
the
court
concerning
the
georgia
law
on
unsworn
statements.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated,
this
law
is
a
continuation
of
the
common
law
possibly
not
quite
as
broad
in
the
usage
as
it
was
at
that
time
because
as
some
authorities,
i
have
studied
--
stated
they
allowed
the
accused
to
also
argue
his
case
at
the
same
time
in
addition
to
making
such
statement
as
he
saw
fit.
in
that
respect,
it
is
not
quite
as
broad.
however,
in
the
interpretation
given
this
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
in
my
experience
since
there
was
a
statement
by
counsel
for
mr.
ferguson
that
been
my
experience
it
has
been
extremely
liberally
construed
in
behalf
of
the
accused
even
in
the
trial
courts,
and
of
course,
i
cannot
demonstrate
that
to
you.
mr.
dan
winn
in
this
particular
case,
the
only
--
the
colloquy
is
shown
in
the
record
if
the
court
please
that
is
--
and
not
as
my
friend
mr.
maxwell
stated
an
accused
is
told
to
take
the
stand
and
i
--
i
believe
he
--
he
stated
that
--
in
this
case,
this
accused
was
told
to
--
to
take
the
stand
--
mr.
dan
winn
that
is
--
yes,
sir,
but
that
is
not
the
--
that
is
not
the
practice.
he
has
the
right
at
the
time
the
state
rest
to
present
anything
he
wants
to
present
as
in
any
other
court.
and
it
was
a
part
of
that.
he
wants
to
make
an
unsworn
statement.
he
can't
either
make
it
or
not
make
it.
the
state
cannot
--
cannot
comment
on
his
failure
to
take
the
stand
or
his
failure
to
be
a
witness
at
all.
he
cannot
even
comment
on.
mr.
dan
winn
no
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
the
failure
to
take
the
stand,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
dan
winn
yes
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
he
may
do
that
at
any
time.
he
may
never
mention
that
if
he
sees
fit.
mr.
dan
winn
no,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
he
can
make
that
either
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
or
at
the
conclusion
of
the
states
case.
he
has
a
--
has
a
right
to
make
his
opening
state
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
if
he
sees
fit
at
the
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
he
may.
he
may
at
that
time
make
a
statement.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
no,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
if
the
court
please?
yesterday
we
began
to
discuss
the
code
section
which
i
feel
and
stated
to
the
court,
was
the
only
constitutional
question
in
this
case.
we
had
mentioned
the
fear
of
the
different
phases
of
the
procedure
under
that
code
section
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
to
--
presented
down
on
orderly
manner,
i
would
like
to
go
over
that
a
moment.
that
--
that
is
this
that
the
--
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
make
this
unsworn
statement.
he
--
he
may
make
it
if
he
chooses.
he
does
not
have
to
make
any
statement
as
in
another
jurisdiction.
he
does
not
have
to
take
a
stand
unless
he
and
his
counsel
so
choose.
now,
the
apparent
construction
of
that
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
is
the
issue
here
and
since
the
features
of
it
were
gone
into
yesterday,
i
--
i
thought
it
would
be
well
to
mention
some
of
the
phases
of
it
that
are
that
the
defendant
cannot
waive
this
right
not
to
be
sworn
as
a
witness,
as
was
mentioned
yesterday.
he
--
he
cannot
be
sworn
under
38-416
of
the
code
of
georgia
as
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
yesterday.
he
cannot
get
around
that
code
section.
this
particular
code
section
gives
him
a
right
in
addition
to
that
the
code
section
to
be
--
to
make
this
unsworn
statement.
it
--
mr.
dan
winn
is
--
he
--
he
had
no
right
as
it
was
pointed
out
yesterday
to
be
sworn
as
a
witness
under
common
law
and
that
is
the
statute
38-416
that
he
made
not
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes.
that's
--
that's
a
code
section
not
before
this
court.
mr.
dan
winn
it
makes
him
incompetent
as
a
witness.
then
this
code
section
makes
him
--
gives
him
the
right
to
make
this
unsworn
statement.
mr.
dan
winn
not
to
the
colony.
it
does
go
back
to
the
original
--
well,
there
was
no
code
section
prior
to
1866
which
was
--
mr.
dan
winn
prior
to
that.
mr.
dan
winn
not
prior
to
1866,
according
to
my
research.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
i
--
i
--
it's
hard
to
answer
that
question.
by
looking
at
the
record,
he
did
not
tender
himself
as
a
witness.
the
--
the
usual
procedure
is
--
for
the
accused
to
take
a
stand
and
--
and
either
the
court
or
his
counsel
instructing
as
to
his
rights.
in
this
case,
he
did
take
the
stand
and
as
will
be
shown
by
the
record,
the
--
he
was
asked
his
name
by
counsel
and
then
asked
this
one
question,
"let
me
ask
you
this,
did
you
murder
anybody?"
now,
there
was
--
technically,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
request
to
be
made
anything.
i
was
going
to
get
to
that
point
later.
there
is
no
--
mr.
dan
winn
there's
no
foundation
for
--
for
exercising
even
to
ask
the
judge
to
exercise
any
discretion
that
he
might
have
in
--
in
letting
him
testify
or
letting
him
be
examined
by
his
counsel.
mr.
dan
winn
it
is
all
--
mr.
dan
winn
they
have
been
tendered
--
mr.
dan
winn
it
has
been
held
that
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
make
--
that
would
be
making
them
competent,
if
the
court
pleases
and
--
and
they
do
not
have
that
right
to
make
themselves
what
we
consider
a
competent
witness.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
that's
--
that
is
correct.
he
--
he
is
not
a
--
a
competent
witness
and
is
not
placed
on
the
stand,
as
such.
there
is
a
case
which
holds
under
a
request
to
swear
the
accused
that
he
does
not
have
that
right
under
this
code
section.
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
tender
himself
to
be
sworn
as
a
witness
and
that
cannot
be
waived
in
any
manner.
he
--
mr.
dan
winn
it
still
holds
true
in
georgia
of
that
theory
because
it
--
it
has
been
held
that
they
don't
have
--
they
--
of
course
under
this
code
section,
do
not
--
cannot
be
cross-examined
unless
they
submit
themselves
to
it.
the
construction
of
that
is
that
they
can't
even
be
asked
a
question
unless
they
submit
themselves
to
it.
so,
counsel
for
the
state
cannot
start
cross-examining
them
to
see
if
they
will
answer
questions.
they
--
they
cannot
even
ask
the
first
question
and
give
him
the
opportunity
to
refuse
to
answer.
it
would
put
him
at
a
--
at
a
disadvantage
of
course,
to
the
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
i
have
--
i
consider
it
so
now
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
defense
attorneys
in
georgia
do
for
--
mr.
maxwell
mentioned
yesterday
that
he
had
been
quite
interested
in
getting
this
code
section
changed
so
as
the
solicitor
general's
association
of
georgia
and
it
would
have
been
changed
years
ago,
had
we
not
had
so
many
defense
attorneys
in
the
legislature.
i
--
but,
as
he
seeks
to
do
here,
this
court
should
not
try
to
pressure
the
georgia
legislature
into
creating
a
new
code
section.
i
would
agree
that
with
him
that
it
should
be
done
and
i
think
eventually,
will
in
not
too
distant
future,
but
it
will
not
be
--
mr.
dan
winn
that
--
i'm
sure
that
that's
the
--
that
would
be
the
ruling
of
the
court,
but
it
would
have
the
effect
to
--
mr.
dan
winn
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
we
would
certainly
have
to
have
something.
i
--
i
would
think
that
no
--
no
right
and
i
might
mention
the
hawes
case
in
a
moment
which
points
up
that
one
thing,
it
was
before
this
court
a
good
many
years
ago,
it's
in
fact
the
only
time
that
this
code
section
has
been
before
the
court
and
it
was
in
a
left-handed
sort
of
a
way,
it
--
it
was
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
another
code
section
which
created
a
presumption
of
knowledge
on
the
part
of
any
person
who
--
on
whose
property
a
distilling
apparatus
was
found.
and
the
court
said
that
the
creation
of
this
presumption
was
not
the
denial
of
due
process
because
the
man
had
the
means
afforded
him
to
explain
this
away
by
code
section
38-415
and
that
by
having
this
means
afforded
to
him,
he
was
not
denied
his
constitutional
right
of
due
process.
mr.
dan
winn
that's
--
mr.
dan
winn
it's
hawes
versus
georgia.
it
is
in
the
brief
258
u.s.
page
1
--
at
page
4.
it
--
it
--
certainly
to
my
mind,
points
up
the
--
mr.
dan
winn
h,
a,
w,
e,
s.
mr.
dan
winn
i
am
certain
--
mr.
dan
winn
258
(1),
yes,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
that
--
mr.
dan
winn
that
was
in
1866.
mr.
dan
winn
i'm
looking
at
an
article
on
that.
it
was
in
1866
that
that
disqualification
which
changed.
this
code
section
in
its
present
form,
i
believe
was
in
1868
rather
in
its
final
form.
it
was
changed
in
1868
to
cover
criminal
cases
and
then
in
1874,
it
was
put
in
its
present
form
allowing
the
unsworn
statement.
mr.
dan
winn
no,
sir.
they
have
held
that
he
cannot
read
a
prepared
statement.
he
can,
however,
refer
to
notes
which
is
a
--
a
common
practice
to
have
notes
to
look
at
certain
names.
that
feature
of
it
would
not
deny
him
the
right
of
counsel
during
that
period
of
time.
it
would
--
i
--
i
feel
compelled
and
i
don't
like
to
be
in
this
position,
but
i
do
feel
compelled
to.
well,
i
don't
think
they're
--
they're
--
interwoven
in
the
constitutional
question
here,
i
feel
compelled
to
mention
a
few
of
the
inaccuracies
in
the
brief
for
mr.
maxwell
in
saying
this,
i
--
i
have
a
high
regard
for
him.
i
don't
mean
that
anything
is
intentional,
but
i
--
i
feel
that
it
should
be
pointed
out
here
in
--
on
page
2
of
his
brief,
the
--
the
statement
that
there
was
no
--
that
this
boy
was
held
in
custody
without
being
taken
before
any
committing
magistrate.
well,
that
point
was
never
raised
in
the
trial
nor
pursued
in
any
manner
before,
with
the
officers
who
had
this
boy
in
custody.
certainly,
they
were
--
they
were
not
allowed
to
explain
why
this
should
be
done
--
had
been
done.
it
would've
been
brought
out
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
which
he
mentioned
in
his
brief
but
which
itself,
the
pleadings
nor
any
of
the
testimony
which
was
begun
in
there,
none
of
that
is
before
the
court
and
it's
going
beyond
the
record
to
--
to
include
that.
however,
by
implication,
the
court
could
assume
that
there
was
no
committal
trial.
that's
only
by
implication.
certainly,
it
was
not
raised
as
a
constitutional
question
properly
that
there
was
no
warrant,
that
--
that
was
mentioned
only
one
time
in
the
--
in
the
record.
now,
j.b.
cooper
was
asked
if
he
had
--
why
he
didn't
stop
to
get
a
warrant
before
he
got
the
boy
or
stopped
to
get
one
on
the
way
back
from
arresting
this
boy,
and
he
said
that
he
didn't
stop
by
the
court
house
to
get
a
warrant.
now
that
is
the
only
evidence
in
here
concerning
the
failure
to
have
a
warrant
for
this
boy.
i'm
--
i'm
at
a
somewhat
of
a
disadvantage
in
--
in
having
to
have
that
statement
in
the
record,
when
it
--
when
it
is
actually,
it
implies
things
that
did
not
happen
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
it's
--
it's
going
beyond
the
record,
but
there
was
a
warrant
taken
soon
after
this
occurred.
there
is
a
logical
explanation
for
no
committal
hearing
but,
it
--
it
brings
into
focus
--
the
very
point
i'm
getting
at
is
that
to
imply
that
he
was
denied
his
constitutional
rights
without
laying
that
foundation
in
the
trial
court
is
--
is
not
proper.
now,
the
post
paraffin
test,
there
was
no
--
no
indication
that
that
paraffin
test
was
improper.
they
asked
--
asked
if
or
told
him
what
they're
going
to
do.
the
sheriff
had
requested
the
doctor
from
the
state
crime
laboratory
to
come
there
and
to
perform
this
test.
there
was
no
--
no
force
involved.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
the
testimony
of
denver
gaston
and
let
me
see
--
mr.
dan
winn
j.b.
gaston,
yes,
sir,
it
is.
well
it
and
it
--
it's
in
there
--
also,
i
haven't
found
it
in
mr.
gaston.
it's
also
in
dr.
howard's.
it
tells
about
performing
the
paraffin
test
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
48,
“while
i
was
out
here
on
july
17th,
i
did
the
paraffin
test
on
billy
ferguson.”
he
explains
the
test
there
and
if
there
had
been
anything
improper
there
or
in
the
officer's
conduct
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
stein
case,
it
should've
been
asked
of
them
at
least
or
elicited
from
them
on
the
trial
of
the
case,
to
--
to
show
this
court
whether
or
not,
there
was
anything
improper
and
in
any
of
these
actions
--
mr.
dan
winn
19
years
old.
now,
there
are
four
--
there
are
four
questions
presented
in
--
in
the
appellant's
brief.
one
is,
is
in
--
in
number
one
and
i'm
looking
on
page
2
of
the
appellant's
brief,
where
he
states
there
that
the
confession
was
coerced
and
that
this
--
from
this
young
boy
of
low
mentality.
now,
that
--
that
in
itself
is
--
is
a
misstatement,
because
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
concerning
the
boy's
mentality
is
from
an
--
his
employer,
a
mr.
miller,
at
the
piedmont
company,
there
who
said
he
was
an
average
employee.
that's
the
only
--
only
evidence
of
any
kind,
of
the
boy's
mentality
or
anything
about
him
other
than
this
case.
certainly,
it
would
not
justify
the
statement
that
the
boy
was
of
a
low
mentality.
and
in
that
same
paragraph,
the
point
is
made
that
he
was
not
advised
of
his
constitutional
right
to
have
counsel.
the
record
certainly
discloses
on
page
38
that
this
was
done.
we
advised
him
on
reading
from
the
top
of
page
38,
the
testimony
of
mr.
gaston.
he
had
a
right
to
have
an
attorney
and
also
advised
him
that
he
didn't
have
to
make
a
statement,
but
that
if
he
was
willing,
we
would
put
it
in
writing
and
he
said
he
would
like
to
do
it.
he
wanted
to
cooperate
on
that.
now
--
now
this,
here,
it
might
be
well
to
--
to
recall
that
the
time
element
in
this
case,
which
certainly
distinguishes
it
from
any
of
the
psychological
and
mental
coercion
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court.
this
boy
was
taken
into
custody
shortly
before
noon.
he
was
--
he
was
not
held
in
comunicado
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
the
record
shows
that
his
girlfriend,
a
fiance
was
called
around
noon
and
that
she
came
to
talk
to
him.
and
then
the
--
the
officers
asked
him
about
his
conduct
that
morning.
told
him
he
had
been
seen
there
early
this
--
early
in
the
morning
of
the
killing,
which
was
about
7:30.
he
had
been
seen
there,
leaving
there
or
at
the
place
after
or
around
7
o'clock
and
was
the
last
person
seen
at
this
t.v.
repair
station.
he
was
taken
into
custody
before
noon.
they
talked
to
him
about
his
whereabouts
that
morning.
he
told
them
that
he
had
left
the
repair
station,
gone
to
see
about
a
room,
he
was
going
to
be
married
and
then
went
to
get
the
girl
he
was
going
to
marry
and
from
there,
they
had
gone
to
villa
rica
which
is
about
11
miles
from
douglasville
and
were
on
their
way
back
after
taking
a
blood
test
at
the
hospital
there
when
the
officers
stopped
him.
and,
he
gave
his
whereabouts
of
course
omitting
the
killing
and
the
fact
hat
he
had
gone
by
his
own
apartment
to
leave
the
pistol
and
to
leave
the
wallet,
a
billfold
of
the
deceased,
mr.
luke
brown
and,
so
they
asked
him
that
and
then
quit
questioning
him.
went
on
about
the
business
of
investigating
the
case,
went
to
the
boarding
house,
found
the
murder
weapon,
which
was
a
pistol
in
which
he
had
placed
up
in
a
--
in
the
attic
above
the
closet
in
his
room,
the
pistol
and
the
billfold.
after
they
found
that
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon,
they
came
back
around
3
o'clock
to
3:30
and
confronted
him
with
this
and
then
he
admitted
it.
there
was
no
coercion,
no
--
no
relay
questioning,
no
--
no
psychological,
no
mental
pressure
put
on
him
at
all.
he
was
confronted
with
the
incriminating
evidence
and
that
was
it.
he
said,
yes,
that's
--
that's
the
gun
that
i
killed
him
with.
his
--
his
statement
was
reduced
to
writing
at
that
time
after
the
--
after
he
was
advised
as
i
mentioned
on
page
38
and
on
page
63
that
any
statement
he
used,
he
said,
might
be
used
against
him
in
court
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
an
attorney.
now,
that
--
that's
the
confession.
although
i
--
i
feel
that's
not
a
--
it's
not
a
--
a
part
of
this,
certainly
not
a
part
of
this
because
it
--
it
was
not
properly
raised
in
the
trial
court,
but
if
it
was,
there
was
no
--
no
constitutional
violation
under
any
of
the
rulings
of
this
court.
so,
that
and
the
other
two,
he
has
made
the
point
in
--
in
question
two
there
that
unknown
to
him,
the
--
there
was
a
relative
of
the
state
prosecutor
on
the
jury
and
that
two
jurymen
were
biased.
now
about
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
the
--
he
mentioned
in
his
brief
the
--
the
conduct
of
the
trial
court
in
--
in
discussing
there,
in
ruling
on
it,
the
trial
court
heard
the
motion
for
new
trial,
he
had
it
filed
october
the
10th.
it
was
heard
or
to
be
heard
december
the
25th,
1958,
some
more
than
two
months
after
the
filing
of
the
motion,
plenty
of
time.
he,
at
that
time,
allowed
at
the
request
of
the
state
and
the
accused
additional
time
until
january
the
5th
--
25th,
1959
to
get
up
evidence
of
any
bias
on
the
--
on
the
jury
and
also
anything
else
that
he
might
have
or
that
we
might
have
concerning
his
bias.
and
in
all
of
the
motion
for
new
trial,
there
were
affidavits
concerning
the
relation
and
there
were
affidavits
concerning
his
contentions
on
the
bias
and
those
affidavits
in
--
in
his
question
four,
were
not
sent
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
simply
because
he
didn't
specify
in
his
bill
of
exceptions,
which
is
a
requirement
of
the
georgia
procedure.
and
i
might
mention
here
that
under
the
georgia
procedure,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
cannot
hear
or
consider
any
evidence
that
is
not
or
any
part
of
the
record
that
is
not
approved
by
the
trial
court
and
that
is
the
reason
that
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
not
order
this
record
up
as
such.
it
ordered
any
approved
record
of
this
trial
--
of
this
hearing
on
january
25th,
1959.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
yes.
mr.
dan
winn
now,
she
is
competent
--
mr.
dan
winn
that
was
changed
some
three
or
four
years
ago.
mr.
dan
winn
she
was
neither
competent
nor
compellable.
she
is
only
competent
now,
she
is
not
compellable.
but,
i
mentioned
these
questions
two
and
four
which
are
raised,
not
that
they
have
any
--
any
constitutional
value,
i
don't
think
the
appellant
has
the
right
to
get
into
this
code
on
--
on
a
due
process
question
concerning
this
code
section
and
--
and
then
use
a
scatter
gun
to
try
to
hit
anything
in
the
record
that
might
--
that
might
have
been
technically
incorrect,
which
these
things
were
not
and
i'm
--
i'm
mentioning
those
not
because
they
have
any
importance
before
this
court,
but
to
show
that
they
were
technically
correct
and
i
think
just
a
quick
glance
at
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
will
show
that
those
were
technically
correct
under
the
georgia
procedure.
certainly,
there
was
not
at
any
stage,
any
constitutional
question
raised
on
those
two.
there
was
not
any
constitutional
question
raised
on
the
confession
properly.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
in
the
brief
or
in
the
amended
motion
for
new
trial,
i'm
--
i'm
looking
at
page
11
of
the
amended
motion
for
new
trial
which
was
considered
by
the
court
and
which
the
trial
court
and
which
was
sent
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
here
is
the
--
here
is
his
contention
on
that
to
show
the
court
here
that
--
that
there
was
no
constitutional
question
made
there.
he
states
that
the
confession
was
procured
prior
to
the
time
of
the
grand
jury
indictment
before
any
warrant
had
issue,
that
the
confession
was
obtained
at
that
time
when
defendant
was
being
held
in
jail
without
any
legal
or
formal
charge
and
further
contends,
the
confession
obtained
while
defendant
was
being
held
illegally
and
his
right
of
counsel
and
the
formal
charge
before
a
competent
officer
were
being
violated.
that
therefore,
made
the
confession
void
and
that
is
--
that
is
the
only
--
the
only
thing
that
this
court
would
have
to
go
on
to
--
to
show
that
there
was
any
constitutional
issue
raised,
that
the
confession
was
void,
certainly,
not
a
--
not
a
sufficient
allegation
or
a
sufficient
foundation
under
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
however,
gave
him
the
benefit
of
that
and
considered
his
argument
on
it,
did
not
as
they
could
have
ruled
that
point
out.
they
--
in
their
opinion,
cited
the
mcnabb,
the
mallory
and
the
stein
cases
and
even
--
even
went
ahead
and
considered
his
constitutional
argument
though
--
though
there
was
no
basis
for
it
in
the
record
as
i
say
here
that
it
is
not.
that
--
that
feature
even
if
this
court
decided
to
--
to
consider
the
constitutional
aspect
of
this
confession
would
be
controlled
by
the
stein
case,
that
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
which
holds
it
that
even
if
there
had
been
an
illegal
detention
that
--
that
alone
is
not
enough
to
render
the
confession
illegal
or
render
it
coerced,
either
psychological
or
mental.
back
in
the
remaining
moments
to
the
court
i
have
stated,
i
feel
is
the
only
constitutional
question
here
and
that
is
the
constitutionality
of
code
section
38-415.
as
was
mentioned
earlier,
that
is
--
is
merely
a
continuation
of
the
common
law.
powell
versus
state
of
alabama,
which
is
cited
in
the
brief,
287
u.s.
45,
which
is
apparently,
is
relied
on
quite
strongly
by
the
appellant,
the
court
in
that
case,
laid
down
the
rule
which
had
been
mentioned
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
yesterday.
one
test
that
is
--
which
has
been
applied
to
determine
whether
due
process
of
law
has
been
accorded
in
any
given
instances,
is
to
ascertain
what
were
the
settled
usages
and
modes
of
proceeding
under
the
common
statute
law
of
england,
before
the
declaration
of
independence,
subject
however,
to
the
qualification
that
they
be
shown
not
to
have
been
unsuited
to
the
civil
and
political
conditions
of
our
ancestors,
by
having
been
followed
in
this
country
after
it
became
a
nation.
the
court
--
this
court
said
that
plainly
that
test
had
not
been
met
in
the
powell
case.
that
was
that
involved
the
--
the
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel
by
failing
to
effectually
appoint
an
attorney
before
the
day
of
the
trial.
and
the
court
held
that
that
--
that
was
a
denial
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
in
that,
they
made
a
statement
--
this
court
made
the
statement
that
my
brother
has
seized
upon
to
--
to
hang
his
head
on
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
--
the
accused
is
entitled
to
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
at
every
step
of
the
trial.
certainly,
that
would
not
mean
that
he
was
entitled
to
hold
his
hand
all,
during
the
trial.
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
at
every
proper
step
on
that
trial
was
merely
meant
that
they
were
entitled
to
counsel
in
time
to
prepare
properly
for
the
case
and
that
if
he
didn't
have
the
counsel
at
that
stage,
he
was
effectively
denied
of
that
counsel.
and
this
court
said
that
the
failure
to
give
them
reasonable
time
to
prepare
was
a
clear
denial
of
due
process,
certainly
not
the
case
here.
the
stein
case
certainly
points
up
what
i
have
said
before
and
that
is
that
it
--
certainly
he
was
not
denied
due
process.
the
court
said
in
the
stein
case,
now
that
it
was
particularly
applicable
to
this
case,
where
--
where
here
on
the
trial
of
the
case
and
this
is
the
meat
and
the
only
point
in
this
appeal
and
that
is,
was
this
accused
denied
due
process
by
the
trial
court
and
in
effect,
does
code
section
38-415
deny
him
of
due
--
the
right
to
due
process
or
deny
him
due
process
of
law?
that's
the
--
that's
the
point.
here's
what
he
did
in
order
to
invoke
his
rights.
he
put
the
accused
on
the
stand.
he
said,
"what
is
your
name?"
and
he
said,
"have
you
murdered
anybody?"
and
at
that
point,
he
was
stopped
and
the
court
and
i
--
i
would
like
for
this
court
to
particularly
note
that
the
court
stated
there,
i
must
rule
that
you
do
not
--
mr.
dan
winn
it
is
in
the
colloquy
on
--
at
the
top
of
page
8.
but
on
down
in
that
page,
the
court
states
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
i
must
rule
that
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
question
to
him.
now
if
--
if
there
had
been
any
unusual
circumstance
in
this
case
by
which
he
should
have
been
allowed
to
question
this
boy
and
it
had
been
stated
to
the
court
at
that
time,
he
certainly
would
have
been
allowed
to
and
if
there
was
any
substantial
reason,
i
would
think
that
it
would
deny
him
due
--
due
process
or
could
possibly
in
some
trial,
deny
him
due
process.
the
code
section
and
its
interpretation
does
not,
this
court
did
not.
as
the
court
said
in
the
stein
case,
when
they
--
they
had
the
counsel
for
the
accused
was
complaining
that
if
they
had
put
the
accused
up
on
the
stand
to
--
to
try
to
rebut
the
presumption
concerning
the
admission
of
a
confession
and
to
take
the
stand
and
show
that
that
confession
was
coerced,
they
--
they
argued
that
the
new
york
practice
would've
allow
them
to
be
cross-examined
and
that
they
were
denied
due
process
of
law.
and
the
court,
this
court
answered
that
argument
this
way
and
it's
--
it's
particularly
appropriate
for
this
case.
at
page
175
of
the
stein
case
stein
versus
new
york
346
u.s.
156,
the
court
said,
"we
will
not
adjudge
a
trial
court
guilty
of
constructive
abuse
by
imputing
to
it
a
ruling
that
never
was
made
on
a
proposition
that
never
was
put
to
it"
and
that's
the
case
here.
this
court
would
have
to
find
that
the
--
the
court
had
made
a
--
would've
made
a
certain
ruling
on
a
proposition
that
never
was
put
to
it.
so
he
has
never
invoked
the
full
benefit
of
this
statute.
certainly,
it
does
not,
under
any
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
deny
him
due
process
under
the
--
it
does
not
as
stated
in
the
powell
case.
it
isn't
--
mr.
dan
winn
apparently
that
is
a
--
a
misprint
in
the
record,
someway
because
on
page
8,
it
--
it
--
mr.
dan
winn
you
--
you
saw
that
and
it
--
mr.
dan
winn
that
is
the
correct
occurrence.
there
were
only
those
two
questions.
your
name
is
billy
ferguson?
yes,
sir.
let
me
ask
you,
have
you
murdered
anybody?
and
that's
the
only
part
of
the
record,
there
was
no
request
that
he
made
--
been
made
by
the
witness,
no
request
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
question,
no
--
no
request
to
examine
him.
i
--
i
could
not
help
but
--
mr.
dan
winn
it
--
it
could
be
considered
as
an
implied
request,
it
certainly
does
not
bring
into
--
into
play
the
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
dan
winn
that's
right,
no
right.
my
point
a
while
ago
was
that
--
that
under
the
georgia
procedure,
he
does
not
have
the
right
to
--
he
--
in
the
discretion
of
the
court,
he
could
examine
him,
prompt
him
--
mr.
dan
winn
it
is
done.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
i
do,
because
he
--
here,
he
is
in
the
middle,
he
has
just
put
him
up
and
he
could
--
he
could
certainly
under
our
decisions,
have
asked
and
given
some
basis
for
the
court
exercising
a
discretion.
mr.
dan
winn
it
--
it
is
--
it
certainly
is
the
equivalent
at
that
point
of
--
of
asking
him
to
let
him
examine
him
on
direct
examination.
my
--
my
answer
was
that
before
the
court
could
exercise,
the
court
has
a
discretion
to
allow
him
to,
there
would
have
to
be
some
request
and
some
basis
for
exercising
the
discretion
and
if
he
had
said
here,
this
boy
is
--
is
below
mentality
or
this
--
this
boy
can't
talk
plain,
i
--
i
think
i
--
i
need
to
question
him,
that
would
have
brought
into
play
the
discretion
of
the
court.
mr.
dan
winn
that
was
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
was
too
broad,
a
statement
concerning
the
law,
certainly.
mr.
dan
winn
no.
assuming
that
--
and
there
again,
i
--
i
say
the
court
is
saying
that
he
does
not
have
the
absolute
right
to
question
him.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
court
would
not
permit
any
questions
to
be
put
to
him,
if
he
properly
requested
it
and
the
court
didn't
go
ahead
and
say
that,
but
i
say
that
he
should
have
properly
invoked
to
that
discretion.
the
last
--
the
last
point
that
of
course,
i
--
as
mr.
justice
black
stated
there,
you
--
you
pointed
out
that
you
were
not
stating
whether
or
not
that
was
vital
to
this
issue.
i
do
not
think
it
is
vital
because
if
he
had
no
right
to
question
him
at
all,
i
think
you
would
still
come
under
the
due
process
test
laid
down
in
the
powell
and
other
cases
that
if
he
is
allowed
to
make
an
explanatory
statement,
he
is
not
denied
due
process.
even
though,
certainly,
georgia
statute
goes,
under
its
decisions,
goes
much
--
much
farther
than
that
and
allows
many
other
privileges
and
certainly
the
--
the
privilege
of
having
the
opening
and
conclusion
is
not
taken
away
from
him.
he
still
has
that
even
though
he
is
--
he
is
put
up
on
the
stand.
he
has
the
privilege
even
if
his
counsel
is
permitted
to
asking
questions
not
to
be
cross-examined.
the
state
still
couldn't
cross-examine
him
if
he
didn't
want
to.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
i
would
say
that
--
that
you
would
be,
you
would
certainly
be
assuming
that
the
other
legislatures
of
the
united
states
were
passing
those
things
for
the
benefit
of
the
accused.
mr.
dan
winn
to
make
--
to
--
to
allow
them
to
testify
certainly,
to
make
--
to
make
some
explanation
in
the
trial
of
the
case
was
--
was
of
course,
i
think
mandatory
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
dan
winn
sir?
mr.
dan
winn
to
allow
them
to
make
some
statements
in
that
trial.
the
method
of
making
it
certainly,
would
not
to
allow
them
to
make
any
statement
that
they
want
to,
concerning
the
trial.
certainly
would
not,
as
you
pointed
out
here
and
it's
mentioned
also
in
the
powell
case,
it
doesn't
violate
those
principle
--
fundamental
principles
of
liberty
and
justice
which
lie
to
the
base
of
our
political
institutions.
mr.
dan
winn
alright,
certainly,
if
the
charge
had
been
brought
up
in
this
case,
the
court
could
see
how
the
--
the
weight
that
is
given
to
this.
the
jury
may
give
it
--
they're
instructed
that
they
may
--
that
may
give
it
full
weight
in
the
evidence
in
the
face
of
all
the
other
evidence
there.
mr.
dan
winn
the
charge
was
not
--
not
sent
up
by
the
--
mr.
dan
winn
sir?
mr.
dan
winn
they
all
charge
it.
mr.
dan
winn
you
may
believe
it
in
--
in
whole
or
in
part
and
--
and
the
face
of
all
the
other
evidence
that
--
that
is
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
yes.
they
--
they
may
believe
it
in
preference
to
any
of
the
other
evidence
in
the
case.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
well,
he
--
he
of
course,
exercised
the
right
at
that
point,
not
to
make
the
statement
which
has
been
held
by
this
court
as
merely
a
--
a
tactical
procedure.
he
has
to
--
he
has
to
make
his
decision
whether
or
not,
to
do
that.
why
he
didn't
in
this
case,
i
don't
know.
mr.
dan
winn
about
10
years.
mr.
dan
winn
yes.
mr.
dan
winn
it's
certainly
different
--
the
court
would
permit
to
answer
that,
it
is
certainly
different
but
it
is
not
--
it
is
certainly
--
mr.
dan
winn
no,
i
--
i
would
go
and
say
this,
that
certainly,
the
state
and
the
prosecution
is
far
more
at
a
disadvantage
on
any
of
these
features
than
the
accused.
mr.
dan
winn
(inaudible)
not
to
be
able
to
cross-examine
is
--
is
quite
a
--
quite
a
feature
of
it.
it's
only
been
done
once,
in
the
last
40
years
in
--
in
our
four
counties
and
i
was
certain
and
--
it's
--
it's
quite
a
disadvantage,
i
would
say
the
defendant
--
mr.
dan
winn
now,
i
say,
i
--
i
made
the
statement,
i
--
that
it
was
charged
in
this
case,
of
course,
if
he
doesn't
make
a
statement,
there's
no
comment
on
--
on
the
fact
that
he
did
not
make
a
statement.
mr.
dan
winn
no,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
i
--
i
did
make
a
statement
that
in
this
case
and
in
all
cases
that
the
court
charged
that
principle,
of
course,
in
not
making
the
statement,
the
court,
in
this
case,
didn't
go
ahead
and
charge
those
things.
mr.
dan
winn
did
not
go
ahead
and
charge
those
--
mr.
dan
winn
of
course,
it
would've
--
it
would've
put
him
at
--
at
quite
a
--
an
embarrassing
position
if
--
if
the
court
had.
mr.
dan
winn
yes.
that
if
--
if
he
had
continued
and
made
his
statement,
it
is
automatic.
it
is
required
to
charge
the
--
the
gist
of
what
i
stated
to
the
court.
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
no,
sir.
not
that
i
know
of,
not
in
--
of
course,
it
would
have
to
be
in
georgia
and
i
--
i
do
not
know
of
it
ever
having
been
raised.
none
of
the
other
prosecuting
attorneys
have
ever
mentioned
it.
mr.
dan
winn
only
by
implication
in
the
hawes
case
and
--
mr.
dan
winn
it
was
--
it
was
not
a
substantive
part
of
that
case,
no.
mr.
dan
winn
no,
sir.
mr.
dan
winn
well,
georgia
--
mr.
dan
winn
the
constitutional
--
mr.
dan
winn
yes,
sir.
i
--
to
find
that
citation,
our
--
mr.
dan
winn
well
that
--
that
was
in
the
corbin
case
that
they
did.
that
was
a
recent
case.
they
--
they
did
reiterate
it.
mr.
dan
winn
yes.
mr.
dan
winn
they
--
they
said
this
at
75
--
page
75
of
the
record,
"constitutional
provisions
granting
to
persons
charged
with
crime,
the
benefit
and
assistance
of
counsel
from
further
right
to
perform
those
deeds
and
actions
as
permitted
by
law.”
now
and
to
require
counsel
to
conform
to
the
rules
of
practice
and
procedure
is
not
a
denial
of
the
benefit
and
assistance
of
counsel.
then
they
cite
the
corbin
case
and
said
that,
it
has
been
repeatedly
held
by
this
court
that
he
cannot
as
a
matter
right,
ask
him.
the
constitutional
question
has
been
ruled
on.
i
do
not
have
that
citation.
mr.
dan
winn
yes.
mr.
dan
winn
yes.
yes,
sir.
they
of
course,
the
federal
procedure
does.
mr.
dan
winn
certainly,
the
--
the
federal
rules
controlling
the
georgia
district
--
sorry,
i'm
