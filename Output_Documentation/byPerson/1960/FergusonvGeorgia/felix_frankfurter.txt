justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
the
--
isn't
the
null
of
this
case
that
georgia
had
continued
to
what
was
essentially
under
relevantly,
recently
(inaudible)
at
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is
whether
the
fact
that
its
own
law
makes
it
a
true
law.
didn't
i
ask
you
for
these
questions,
these
both?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
your
georgia
but
that
--
that
would
be
in
each
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
mean
the
competent
witness
that
he
could
make
a
statement
about
whatever
he
wants
to
make
a
statement
about,
and
georgia
has
continued
that,
the
only
statement
you
make
as
i
understand
it,
the
question
is
whether
time
has
so
far
outlawed
that
old
laws
could
make
it
come
in
competent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
your
--
that's
our
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
happened
in
--
would
you
mind
telling
exactly
what
happened
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
winn?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
they
couldn't
very
well,
could
they,
mr.
winn,
as
he
can't
be
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
it's
failure
to
make
some
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask,
it's
just
for
a
matter
of
--
to
get
--
get
more
vividly
how
you
do
things
down
there.
when
the
state
rest
and
assume
that
the
defense
puts
in
a
defense
who
are
the
witnesses,
may
the
defendant
may
--
at
the
very
outset,
may
be
accountable
for
the
defendant
to
say,
"my
client
didn't
make
statement
your
honor,"
how
much
do
you
wait
until
if
it's
all
--
if
the
cases
all
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
you
mean
you
--
he's
not
--
you
don't
compel
him
to
do
anything
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
wants
to
make
a
statement
by
way
of
an
opening,
he
can
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
make
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
counsel
for
the
--
the
prosecutor
doesn't
tell
the
jury
what
the
case
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
then
the
defendant's
counsel
make
his
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
may
the
--
may
--
the
counsel
makes
--
tells
the
jury
what
he
plans
to
defend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
defendant
himself
makes
a
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
did
you
happen
to
search
the
history,
the
genealogy
of
your
present
code
provision
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
that
goes
back
to
some
statutory
provision
when
georgia
was
a
colony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
all
at
common
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
that
no
--
there
was
no
legislation
on
this
subject
when
georgia
became
a
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
it
goes
(voice
overlap)
if
that
is
true,
then
when
it
did
become
--
was
transmuted
from
a
colony
into
a
state,
that
means
it
continued
the
english
law,
with
probably,
the
usual
provision
that
shall
continue
as
or
practically
every
state
except
insofar
as
being
compatible
with
american
institutions
or
words
to
that
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
any
defendant
in
georgia
--
i
guess
in
georgia
law
tender
himself
as
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
have
--
he
may
have
a
counsel,
it
maybe
important,
maybe
certainly
relevant
and
even
important
to
consider
whether
counsel
raised
this
question
but
nobody
would
tender
a
witness
in
georgia
in
a
criminal
case
as
--
tender
a
person,
the
defendant
as
a
witness,
would
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
just
said,
it's
tendering
meaning
that
he
should
go
on
the
--
go
on
the
witness,
take
his
seat
in
the
witness
chair,
put
him
in
direct
evidence
to
be
subject
to
cross-examination.
would
anybody
do
that
in
georgia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
except
that
isn't,
that
a
defendant
is
not
a
competent
witness
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
sense
in
which
the
defendant
is
a
competent
witness
in
a
federal
court
sitting
in
georgia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
english
law
goes
--
which
i
take
it
is
the
georgia
law
and
wants
the
law,
not
by
virtue
of
being
english
law
but
by
continuation
of
the
english
law
in
the
state,
some
of
them
until
they
recently,
english
theory
being
not
very
preserved,
english
law
deriving
not
out
of
a
sense
of
fairness,
unfairness
of
the
defendant
but
their
reasoning
was
very
different.
it
was
immunity
or
inability
to
be
a
competent
witness
in
order
to
protect
him
when
he
goes
on
the
witness
stand
from
being
shown
up
disadvantageous.
that
was
their
theory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
maybe
commit
myself
to
the
rightness
or
the
wrongness
of
that
conception,
but
that
was
a
conception.
this
was
rather
improvident
vitae
instead
being
hostile
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
wouldn't
--
i
don't
know
what
his
hopes
are,
but
we
wouldn't
be
pressuring
in
that
way,
this
one
thought
that
in
1960,
this
--
this
somehow
relates
to
--
too
long
to
the
extent
that
due
process
precludes,
shouldn't
permit
it.
we
wouldn't
be
pressuring,
because
we
would
be
obeying
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
code
section
wouldn't
survive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
what
is
the
law
of
--
of
georgia
as
to
the
competence
of
parties
in
a
civil
suit?
when
did
you
change
the
common
law
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
usual
course
both
in
england
and
in
the
states
is
that
they
first
change
the
rules
as
to
rendering
parties
competent,
often
decades
before
they
change
the
criminal
law
and
they
didn't
change
the
criminal
law
for
it's
not
indicated.
they
thought
that
the
rule
of
mercy
for
the
defendant.
when
did
you
change
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1866.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
--
may
i
break
in
and
quite
out
of
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
wife
of
the
defendant,
if
--
is
she
a
competent
witness
in
georgia?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
that
came
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
up
to
that
time,
she
was
equally
disqualified?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
winn,
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
as
you
know
in
wolf
against
colorado,
you
know
that
case,
that
is
a
case
where
this
court
held
that
illegally
secured
evidence
in
state
prosecution
--
the
admission
of
illegally
secured
evidence
in
state
prosecutions
does
not
--
does
not
prohibit
it
as
against
the
states
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
the
opinion
in
that
case,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
--
rested
conceding
the
determination
of
question
being
what
--
what
are
the
words
he
used,
what
is
so
fundamentally
against
the
thought
and
feelings
and
conscience
of
people
after
the
proposition
it
had?
and
the
conclusion
was
reached
that
in
view
of
the
large
--
very
large
number
of
states
that
had
duly
considered
this
and
the
rulings
in
the
english-speaking
were
generally,
it
couldn't
be
said
on
that
test
that
that
was
valid
due
process.
now,
then,
applying
that
mode
of
dealing
with
the
due
process
clause
as
against
the
state,
what
do
you
say
to
the
relevance
and
weight
of
a
body
of
legislative
enactment
throughout
the
english-speaking
world,
barring
only
one
state,
resting
on
the
conviction
that
it
is
unfair,
whatever
advantage
it
maybe
to
a
guilty
man,
that
he
can't
be
called
and
cannot
be
subjected
to
cross-examination
etc,
if
he
wants
to
take
the
stand,
but
it
is
unfair
to
an
innocent
man,
not
as
a
matter
of
right,
to
let
him
to
tell
his
story.
and
that
such
unanimity
of
judgment,
not
just
talk
but
judgement
expressed
in
legislation
throughout
the
english-speaking
world
in
49,
out
of
our
50
states,
i
say
49,
i
don't
know
about
hawaii,
40
--
48
certainly,
because
alaska
(inaudible),
is
the
judgment
on
whether
this
goes
so
deeply
defended
for
trial,
as
to
be
within
the
scope
of
what
one
draws
out
of
the
due
process
clause,
what
do
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
don't
think
one
would
be
assuming
much
in
the
light
of
--
of
the
writings
that
preceded
and
the
effort
that
preceded
and
the
expression
of
views
by
judges
and
counsel
for
defendants.
i
wouldn't
be
assuming
too
much,
one
wouldn't
be
guessing
as
to
what
was
on
the
mind
of
why
this
movement
has
prevailed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
allowing
the
statement,
you
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
allow
them
to
make
a
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
winn,
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
matter
of
human
fact,
the
clean
mind
making
a
statement,
my
side
of
the
story
without
any
ability
on
the
part
of
this
--
of
the
state
to
cross-examine
me
or
my
counsel,
bringing
it
out,
not
having
whatever
force
there
is
to
an
oath
and
our
whole
procedure,
goes
on
the
assumption
that
oath
is
a
waiting
thing.
these
jurors
certainly,
normally,
would
think
there
was
a
difference
if
a
man
who
solemnly
swears
to
something
as
against
making
what
they
would
might
--
might
think
was
a
speech.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
they
charge
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
normal
charge,
mr.
winn?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you've
just
said
is
that
what
judges
normally
charge
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
this
that
you
may
on
the
basis
of
what
the
prisoner
said
you
may
disregard
all
the
testimony
of
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
been
in
solicitor
for
--
you
had
long
experience
as
a
solicitor,
have
you
not?
some
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
10
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
that
that's
out
and
not
be
asking
for
it.
i
was
going
to
ask
your
evaluation
between
the
--
i'm
talking
about
an
innocent
man,
an
innocent
man
being
able
out
on
the
stand,
being
led
by
his
conscience
to
direct
examination,
withstanding
all
the
effort
of
the
prosecutor
to
undermine,
to
listen
what
he
has
said?
i'm
wondering
whether
you
thought
that
was
not
different
from
just
telling
a
man
to
make
an
unquestioned
and
unquestionable
speech.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
big
enough
to
say
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
have
answered
--
your
answer
is
a
two-edged
sword,
i
think.
probably
the
jury
knows
if
--
quite
a
different
advantage
in
the
--
in
the
way
they're
attach
to
what
he
said.
the
jury
is
bright
enough
to
know,
well,
you
know,
you
can
say
anything
so
nobody
can
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
winn,
with
chief
justice's
permission
i
want
to
be
sure
that
--
that
i
did
understand
you
correctly
that
of
course,
in
the
federal
court
city
in
georgia,
in
the
federal
district
court,
prosecuting
federal
crime,
georgia
lawyers
practicing
one
day
before
state
courts,
(inaudible)
for
the
federal
court
and
georgia
district
--
district
judge
--
in
federal
district
judges,
who
come
from
the
georgia
bar,
they
all
follow
the
regular
federal
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
defendant
can
take
the
witness
stand
as
the
full
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
sure
that
does.
i
mean
to
--
no,
it
never
came
up
that
they
say,
we
--we
do
it
differently
in
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
he
--
that
he
was
coerced
in
signing
that
statement
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
was
coerced
---
that
he
was
not
--
that
he
was
under
coercive
pressure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
sign
that
he
was
told
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
have
the
evidence
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
can
you
feather
16
from
15?
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
extend
your
argument
is
what
--
if
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
is
the
answer
you
made.
you
say
it
has
nothing
to
do
whether
he
can
be
a
full-fledged
witness,
so
that
he
can
be
(inaudible),
that
he
can
be
cross
--
that
he
can
inquire
into
by
your
--
by
his
congress.
you'd
say
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
then
what
is
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
not
in
this
case,
then
it
isn't
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
not
in
the
case
then
what
is
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
spell
out
what
your
case
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
why
would
you
--
why
were
--
why
were
you
stopped
from
dealing
with
your
--
with
the
defendant
the
way
any
lawyer
deals
with
the
(inaudible)
with
the
man
on
the
witness
case.
why
weren't
you
allowed
to
do
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
it
against
the
law?
if
16
weren't
on
the
books,
couldn't
you
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
was
a
competent
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
isn't
a
competent
witness
because
of
416.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
how
can
you
say
there's
nothing
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
what
kind
of
a
lawyer
you
are
but
wouldn't
you
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
--
the
issue
before
us
is
not
whether
you
--
what
you
thought
or
didn't
think,
well
the
issue
is
what
you
did
and
didn't
do,
but
the
issue
is
whether
416,
is
relevant
to
our
discussion
of
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
corbin
case
says,
i
read
from
the
corbin
case,
the
right
to
make
a
statement
in
this
special
ground
(inaudible)
alleges
that
the
court
erred
in
refusing
to
permit
(inaudible)
counsels
to
question
him,
while
he
was
making
a
statement
and
so
on.
the
right
to
make
and
he
said
that
--
that
ground
is
no
good
because
the
right
to
make
a
statement
in
his
behalf
is
a
personal
right
granted
to
the
defendant
by
code
38-415
and
extends
no
further
than
to
permit
him
personally
to
make
to
the
court
and
the
jury
such,
does
some
statements
--
statement
that
he
deems
proper
in
his
defense.
his
counsel
has
no
right
to
ask
him
questions
while
he's
making
his
statement.
applied
that
however,
in
his
discretion
and
permit
his
counsel
to
ask
him
questions
or
make
suggestions
in
relating
to
his
statement,
while
he's
making
it
or
when
he's
concluded.
i
don't
understand
what
that
means,
myself.
you
can't
ask
him
any
questions,
but
he
may
make
suggestions
or
ask
him
questions
while
he's
making
it,
if
those
are
contradicting
statements,
i
don't
know
what
contradicting
statements
are.
