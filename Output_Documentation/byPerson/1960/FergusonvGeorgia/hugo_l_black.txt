justice
hugo
l.
black
stop
at
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
cited?
justice
hugo
l.
black
h,
a,
w,
e,
s?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
in
your
brief.
in
the
index,
i
don't
find
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
258,
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
does
that
appear
in
the
testimony
of
that
--
that
test?
justice
hugo
l.
black
j.b.
gaston.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
old
was
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
on
the
record?
page
8,
i'm
informed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
--
just
--
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
the
reason
i
asked
you
what
page
that
was
on,
on
page
70,
when
the
state
rested,
billy
ferguson
was
called
to
the
witness
stand
and
he
said,
"my
name
is
billy
ferguson,
defendant
rests."
that's
all
that
appears
there.
hundreds
of
(inaudible)
on
those
statements
are
different,
just
to
weigh
of
power
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
i've
read.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
correct,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
if
what
appears
later
on
eight
days,
not
the
equivalent
of
the
request
to
be
allowed
to
examine
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
court
--
when
they
hear
that,
do
you
accept
that
and
indicated
that
you
might
as
well
be
down
the
stairs
or
across
the
street
while
he's
up
there,
but
i
can't
have
questions.
the
court
said
however
logical
your
argument
may
be,
i'm
compelled
to
hold
that
you
do
not
have
the
right
to
do
anything
more
than
instruct
your
client
as
to
his
right,
but
you
have
no
right
to
question
him
on
direct
examination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
the
reason
for
the
argument
you're
making.
are
you
saying
that
he
did
not
specifically
say
that
i
ask
you
in
your
discretion
to
commit
me
to
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
what
he
has
said
here
is
not
enough
to
raise
the
question
assuming
that
it
is,
as
in
the
validity?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
know
that
--
how
crucial
it
is
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that's
why
i'm
asking
this,
when
he
said,
he's
now
called
upon
to
get
on
to
stand,
i
might
just
as
well
be
down
stairs
of
court
(inaudible)
for
the
pretrial
is
up
there.
what
(inaudible)
if
i
can't
ask
you
any
question?
isn't
that
the
equivalent
of
asking
the
court
to
let
him
ask
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
winn,
your
time's
up,
but
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
as
you
know,
has
to
this
particular
constitutional
question
with
reference
to
the
right
of
counsel
of
the
defendant
at
this
time,
ever
been
before
a
federal
court
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly,
it
is
never
been
before
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
that
and
i
didn't
quite
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
--
this
question
of
whether
it
invades
the
right
to
counsel,
as
it
is
protected
by
whatever
constitutional
provision
is
protected,
it
has
never
been
before
us
before,
has
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
did
georgia
first
pass
on
it?
have
they
ever
passed
on
it
precisely
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
general
aspects
of
it,
but
have
they
ever
had
precisely
presented
to
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
before
this
is
to
whether
the
right
to
counsel
includes
the
right
to
have
the
counsel
question
the
defendants,
if
he
so
desires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
case,
is
it
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
1956?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
passed
on
a
precise
question
as
to
whether
that
denied
right
of
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
understand
you
correctly
and
the
objection
you
made
on
page
8,
it
was
this
--
limited
to
this.
they
allowed
him
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf.
you
ask
--
you
wanted
to
ask
him
questions
yourself,
they
said
following
the
corbin,
they
do
not
permit
that.
you
then
said
that
that
violated
section
205
--
105
of
the
georgia
constitution
and
also
article
6
and
article
14
of
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
raised
here,
what
you
raised
in
that
as
i
read
it,
as
i
understand
you
that's
what
you
said,
you
say
that
it
deprived
him
of
the
right
to
counsel
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
its
federal
(inaudible)
to
allow
him
to
make
the
statement
and
to
deny
his
--
him
the
benefit
of
having
his
counsel
guide
and
assist
him
by
asking
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
you
raised.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
insisted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
it
permitted
him
to
make
a
statement
sworn
or
unsworn
is
immaterial.
that
if
they
permit
him
to
make
statements,
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
they
could
do
what
they
make
him
competent
or
incompetent,
they
have
(voice
overlap)
passed
on.
georgia
said
that
he
can
make
a
statement.
you
say
that
when
they
go
that
far,
the
amendment
of
federal
constitution
steps
in
and
say
you
got
to
give
him
the
benefit
of
counsel
to
ask
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
(voice
overlap)
would
raise
for
counsel
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--i
understand
it.
but
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
georgia,
well
they've
interpreted
to
this
meaning
that
you
cannot
ask
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
accept
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we'll
accept
that
and
you
say,
and
since
that
if
the
law
in
georgia,
they
allow
him
to
make
a
statement
but
don't
allow
his
counsel
to
ask
him
questions
it
deprives
of
the
right
to
counsel
unconstitutionally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
he
has
constitutional
right
to
examine,
to
have
--
have
his
lawyer
ask
him
the
question,
whether
the
judge
wants
to
do
it
on
his
discretion
or
not?
