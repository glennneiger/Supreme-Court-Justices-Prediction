where
--

page

well,
that's
the
opinion
of
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
did
you
raise
it
in
the
--
where
did
you
first
raise
it,
i
asked
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
in
this
record
does
it
show
that?
that's
what
i
mentioned
to
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
go
ahead
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
questioning
of
the
jurors
on
the
part
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
--
where
you
reading?
chief
justice
earl
warren
4?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
called
on
cleaving
and
practice
applicable
to
both
criminal
and
civil
litigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
what
are
their
answers?
what
were
their
answers
as
to
whether
or
not
they
knew
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
one
of
those
who
was
relative,
the
one
that
you
stated
that
the
question
had
been
asked
of
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
winn.
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
his
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
billy
ferguson,
appellant,
versus
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
winn,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
in
addition
to
what
mr.
winn,
i
didn't
quite
understand
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
making
him
incompetent.
the
act
makes
him
incompetent
as
a
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
winn
the
very
first
question
he
asked,
let
me
ask
you
have
you
murdered
anybody?
the
solicitor
general
then
said,
"that
is
highly
irregular
and
improper,
there
is
no
authority
for
counsel
questioning
a
witness."
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
sets
him
off
rather
abruptly,
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
then
when
he
tried
to
explain
it
--
explain
why
he
wanted
to
do
it,
the
--
the
court
have
made
the
remark
that
justice
black
has
just
led
to
you
that
no
matter
how
logical
it
was,
he
--
he
must
inform
him
that
you
have
no
right
to
question
him
on
direct
examination,
it
couldn't
be
much
broader,
could
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
the
statute,
isn't
it
--
that
in
the
statute
isn't
it,
mr.
winn?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
winn,
i
--
i
was
wondering
why
if
this
man
did
not
make
a
statement
the
court
charged
them
on
--
on
the
fact
that
he
could
make
a
statement
then
what
the
weight
of
that
statement
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
if
he
doesn't
--
if
he
doesn't
make
a
statement,
do
the
--
does
the
court
advise
the
jury
anyway
that
he
can
make
a
statement
and
then
if
he
does
make
a
statement,
he
cannot
be
cross-examined
and
that
it's
entitled
a
full
weight
if
they
wanted
to
give
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
did
the
--
that
in
this
case,
the
court?
i
thought
you
said
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
not
charge
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
the
fact
is
that
he
did
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
maxwell,
mr.
winn
has
taken
your
argument
to
test
when
the
accuracy
of
your
--
of
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
was
he
correct
or
incorrect
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
then,
let
me
ask
you
this.
let
me
ask
you
this,
where
in
the
record
do
we
find
the
fact
that
this
--
this
petitioner
was
not
taken
before
a
court
from
july,
sometime
whatever
date
it
was,
he
was
arrested
until
september.
chief
justice
earl
warren
26,
will
you
read
--
will
you
just
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
just
give
me
the
part
that
i
asked
for,
the
part
he
said,
he
wasn't
taken
before
a
court
for
all
those
months.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
does
that
mean
that
he
wasn't
taken
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
a
court
for
three
months?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
record
and
how
did
you
raise
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
clearest
answer
you
can
give
me,
as
to
where
i
find
it
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
where
is
the
evidence
we
must
rely
on
for
coercion
of
your
--
of
the
confession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
the
--
what
counsel
has
pointed
out
us
is
that
the
police
did
tell
him
that
he
was
entitled
to
--
to
a
--
a
lawyer
and
that
he
wasn't
required
to
make
a
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
is
your
evidence
that
he
was
coerced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
have
any
evidence
to
that
effect,
do
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
were
no
contradictions
of
your
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
testify
that
he
was
--
that
he
is
coerced
or
anybody
testified
that
he
was
coerced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
the
contrary
the
officers
testified
that
he
was
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
assuming
that
you
have
--
that
you
do
have
a
point
there,
show
me
in
the
record
where
you
raised
it
as
a
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
can
you
come
to
this
court
then
that
you
had
--
didn't
raise
it
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
maybe
we
better
talk
about
that
then.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
could
be
--
