mr.
paul
james
maxwell
chief
justice
warren,
this
honorable
court
pleases.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia.
billy
ferguson,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
a
19-year-old
boy
who
is
arrested
without
a
warrant
in
july
the
17th,
1958
at
douglasville,
georgia.
he
was
immediately
taken
to
the
jail
and
locked
up,
where
he
was
questioned
for
approximately
seven
hours
by
about
five
or
six
policemen,
deputy
sheriffs
and
georgia
bureau
of
investigation
officers.
all
of
whom
refused
to
take
this
boy
before
committing
magistrate
on
the
georgia
law
to
inform
amicus
right
to
have
counsel.
and
after
being
confined
in
jail,
he
was
then
being
questioned.
he
was
forced
to
take
a
paraffin
test.
he
was
finally
and
mentally
coerced
into
making
a
confession.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
paraffin
test,
your
honor.
paraffin
test.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
paraffin
test,
your
honor,
is
where
they
put
wax,
as
i
understand
it,
on
your
hand
to
see
whether
you
have
fired
a
gun
or
not,
to
see
if
you
had
recently
fired
a
pistol
or
a
gun.
he
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
on
september
the
15th,
1958
which
was
approximately
two
months
after
he
was
arrested.
he
was
tried
on
september
the
23rd,
1958
and
found
guilty
and
sentenced
to
death
by
electrocution.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affirmed
the
lower
court.
now,
this
honorable
court
pleases,
we
contend
that
this
appellant
has
been
denied
his
constitutional
rights
before
his
trial,
during
his
trial
and
after
his
trial.
he
was
not
given
we
contend
a
fair
impartial
and
legal
trial.
now,
if
this
court
pleases,
georgia
has
to
say
the
very
least
a
unique
and
a
distinctive
law
which
is
called
section
38-415
in
which
will
be
found
set
out
on
page
3
of
the
appellant's
brief
in
which
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
read.
in
all
criminal
trials,
the
prisoner
shall
have
the
right
to
make
to
the
court
jury
just
such
statements
on
the
case
as
he
may
deem
improper
in
his
defense.
it
shall
not
be
under
oath
and
shall
have
such
force
only
as
a
jury
who
may
think
right
to
give
it.
they
may
believe
in
preference
to
the
sworn
and
testimony
in
the
case.
the
prisoner
shall
not
be
compelled
to
answer
any
questions
on
cross-examination
should
he
think
proper
to
decline
to
answer.
now,
georgia
supreme
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
defense
lawyer
has
no
right
to
ask
or
assist
the
defendant
in
any
way
when
he
is
on
the
stand.
it
is
our
contention,
if
this
honorable
court
pleases,
that
this
code
section
38-415,
as
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
is
invalid
under
both
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
federal
constitution.
now,
i
would
like
to
say
right
here,
if
the
court
pleases,
that
when
i
first
moved
to
georgia
about
eight
years
ago,
i
was
indeed
surprised
that
this
unique
law
but
i
was
more
surprised
that
while
the
code
section
has
been
in
operation
since
i
believe
1868
and
there
have
been
hundred
of
cases
taken
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
regarding
its
logic
and
other
factories,
no
one
ever
raised
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
statute
until
i
attempted
to
do
so
in
the
corbin
case
which
is
212
georgia,
page
231
where
in
the
georgia
supreme
court
ruled
that
i
--
it
was
not
properly
raised
and
therefore
refused
to
pass
on
it.
and
it
was
brought
to
this
court
on
certiorari
and
of
course
declined.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
like
i
said
before
has
repeatedly
held
that
they
cannot
assist
in
any
way.
now,
if
i
may
illustrate
what
happens
in
georgia,
the
defendant
has
told
the
(inaudible)
upon
the
witness
stand.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
he
is
told.
he
wants
--
wants
--
defend
lawyer
wants
him
to
do
this,
told
about
on
a
witness
stand.
he
gets
up
on
the
witness
stand
and
the
judge
turns
to
him
and
says,
now,
mr.
--
in
this
case,
"mr.
ferguson,
you
are
charged
with
murder.
you
have
a
right
to
make
to
the
jury
setting
over
there
just
such
a
statement
as
you
want
to
make
if
you
care
to
make
one.
you
can't
be
sworn,
nobody
can
ask
any
questions.
now,
go
ahead
and
make
a
statement
if
you
want
to
make
one.
now,
this
honorable
court
will
try
to
realize
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
i
believe
--
i
certainly
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
they
mostly,
say
very
seldom
do
i
ever
repeat
the
code
section
word
to
word.
however,
most
people
especially
a
boy
like
this
boy,
most
people
who
have
never
been
to
a
court
for
anything
in
their
life,
they're
tongue
tied,
they're
nervous,
the
lawyer
--
his
lawyer
might
just
well
get
up
and
go
downstairs
or
outside
and
go
and
have
a
cup
of
coffee,
he
can't
do
a
thing
for
him,
he
can't
help
in
any
way
whatsoever.
he
gets
up
there
and
he'll
stammer
around
and
most
of
them
will
say,
"well,
i
--
"
that
is
--
i
--
look
at
the
jury
and
say,
"well,
i
didn't
do
it."
and
none
at
all
else
to
say,
and
the
lawyer
sits
there
like
this,
"tongue
tie
can't
help
him
anyway
whatsoever."
however,
the
supreme
court
has
now
interpreted
into
this
code
section
that
while
the
defense
lawyer
has
not
--
does
not
have
a
right
to
ask
any
questions,
it
is
discretionary
where
the
judge
as
to
whether
he
shall
be
allowed
to
ask
any
questions
or
not.
now,
as
it
isn't
--
so
the
city
of
atlanta,
the
criminal
court
is
divided
in
two
sections,
two
divisions.
now,
if
i
may
point
out
to
this
court,
down
at
this
under
the
hall
as
division
number
one,
down
at
this
under
the
hall
as
division
number
two.
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
murder
trial
about
to
start
down
in
division
number
one
and
a
murder
trial
to
start
down
in
division
number
two.
the
lawyer
--
the
defense
lawyer
down
on
number
one,
says
to
the
judge,
"if
your
honor
pleases,
i
know
i
don't
have
any
right
to
ask
any
questions
on
the
georgia
law
but
from
my
help
my
client
out."
and
that
judge
says,
"well
yes,
go
ahead.
ask
him
anything
you
want
to
ask
him.help
him
all
you
want
to
help
him."
at
the
same
time
--
same
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall,
that
lawyer
has
the
same
question
and
the
judge
says,
"absolutely
not,
you
have
no
right
to
ask
him
any
questions
and
i
forbid
you
to
ask
too
many
questions."
now,
how
can
anybody
say
that
that
is
equal
protection
of
the
law?
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
they
do
not.
they
do
not
exercise
that
discretion.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
not
your
honor,
unless
--
unless
the
defendant
refused.
now,
if
their
defendant
says
it's
alright
for
him
to
ask
me
questions,
then
he
may
do
so.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
unless,
he
--
if
he
declines
to
do
so
your
honor,
it
says,
if
he
declines
to
do
so
mostly
with
this
permission.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
that
is
right.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
it
would
your
honor.
it
would.
my
contention
is
this,
that
that
code
section
does
not
say
anything
about
direct
examination.
it
stresses
and
strongly
says,
"cross-examination."
now,
if
the
court
is
going
to
interpret
the
cross-examination
means,
any
kind
of
examination,
that
it
would
be
up
to
the
defendant
to
say,
"i
would
like
my
attorney
to
ask
me
some
questions
and
i
would
like
the
solicitor
to
ask
me
some
questions."
but
it
has
not
deemed
to
be
in
to
be
that
way.
it
is
deemed
that
he
can't
get
up
and
make
a
statement
but
he
cannot
be
cross
examined
if
he
declines
to
do
so.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
(inaudible)
law.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
the
answer
to
--
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that
the
old
law
is
embodied
in
416
which
follows
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
your
honor.
yes
sir,
it
was.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir,
it
is.
it's
the
only
state
as
i
understand
it
in
the
united
states
that
has
such
a
law.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
my
view
is
your
honor
that
the
whole
code
section
is
invalid.
you're
asking
my
view.
my
view
is
that
it's
all
invalid.
it's
invalid
because
it
denies
to
the
first
it
denies
to
the
defendant
the
benefit
of
counsel
that
the
most
important
time
of
his
trial
when
he
needs
counsel
law
and
he
does
any
other
trial.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
--
i
believe
if
the
--
the
part
that
says
that
he
may
make
a
statement,
any
statement
that
he
desires
to
make,
i
believe
that
that
would
mean
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
have
assistance,
at
least
assistance
from
his
own
attorney
in
making
that
statement.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
before
he
gets
on
the
stand.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
he
can't
be
assisted
even.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
prefer
my
reference
would
be
--
i
prefer
for
the
justice
on
both
sides
for
the
defense
and
for
the
state
if
he
was
allowed
to
do
like
you
do
every
other
jurisdiction
including
the
federal
courts
if
you
want
to
put
the
man
up
on
a
witness
stand
and
let
him
get
up,
he
swore
in
and
testify
and
then
be
cross
examined.
i
don't
see
how
a
jury
could
arrive
at
the
truth
about
things
if
some
man
is
put
up
on
a
witness
stand
and
that
the
judge
tells
the
jury,
"now,
you're
going
to
believe
if
want
to
you
can
believe
in
preference
to
a
sworn
testimony.
most
people
believe
in
the
sworn
testimony.
now,
it
is
worthy
also
a
note
that
your
honors,
justice
whittaker
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
stated
that
that
is
followed
by
4
--
416.
now,
in
a
reply
brief
that
was
stated
on
page
9.
they
were
--
they
say
and
even
if
the
code
section
38-415
is
invalid
that
if
found
this
case
would
not
be
benefit
since
he
would
be
unable
to
make
any
statement.
now,
my
answer
to
that
is
first
of
all,
we
have
to
cross
that
bridge
if
it
is
invalid
when
we
can't
do
it.
but
secondly,
i
feel
a
no
that
the
georgia
legislature
at
this
court
was
to
rule
that
that
code
section
was
invalid
on
the
constitutional
grounds
which
we
had
certainly
asking
this
court
to
do
that
the
georgia
--
georgia
legislature
would
immediately
pass
a
bill
which
they
have
been
trying
to
get
them
to
do.
every
grand
jury
presumptive
recommends
that
it'd
be
abolished.
and
most
judges
and
lawyers
on
layman
preferred
to
have
it
abolish
than
they
give
into
their
vagarious
way
of
doing
things
by
having
any
competent
witness.
now
also,
where
it
says
that
he
is
incompetent
to
show
you
how
confusing
this
whole
thing
is
on
page
14
at
the
top
of
the
page,
of
the
reply
brief,
the
appellee
says,
"it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
georgia
practice
of
the
law
in
a
criminal
defendant
who
was
incompetent
to
be
a
witness
to
make
an
unsworn
statement
without
being
under
direct
examination
buy
his
counsel
is
not
violated
with
these
vagrancies.
the
part
i
want
to
bring
out
is
where
it
says
who
was
incompetent
to
be
a
witness.
now
in
1951,
the
georgia
legislature
added
to
the
georgia
code
section
38-1606
an
evidence
of
following
and
i
quote
"provided,
however,
that
this
section
shall
not
prevent
a
party
charged
with
adultery
from
being
competent
to
testify
as
to
his
or
her
innocent
of
such
charge."
therefore,
defendant
charged
in
the
state
of
georgia
with
a
crime
of
filthy
is
competent
but
if
he's
charged
with
murder,
he
is
not
competent.
that's
how
confusing
it
is.
that
was
an
act
of
1951
where
they
simply
made
adultery,
the
crime
of
adultery
a
person
could
be
a
competent
witness.
now,
this
appellant
was
arrested
without
a
warrant,
never
taken
before
committing
(inaudible).
he's
held
in
jail
for
about
two
months.
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
taken
out
on
his
behalf
on
september
the
4th
and
the
trial
judge
set
that
out
for
a
hearing
on
the
23rd
--
the
15th
day
of
september,
1958,
which
was
the
same
day
that
the
grand
jury
was
meeting.
now,
that
was
in
violation,
this
holding
there
was
in
violation
of
code
section
27-212
which
is
set
out
on
page
3
of
the
appellant's
brief
and
with
says
that
any
personal
arrested
without
a
warrant
shall
be
conveyed
immediately
or
as
soon
as
possible
before
admitting
magistrate
and
anybody
held
over
48
hours
shall
be
released.
when
this
--
and
also
i'd
like
to
bring
out
--
to
bring
to
this
court's
attention
in
the
appellee's
brief.
they
say
on
page
17
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
any
illegal
detention,
no
record
in
the
evidence
of
any
illegal
detention.
they
stated
that
on
page17.
in
the
record
on
page
--
starting
on
page
26,
27
and
28,
if
this
court
pleases,
the
officer,
j.b.
cooper
says,
"we
have
a
justice
of
the
peace
on
this
courthouse,
i
did
not
stop
at
that
justice
of
the
peace
or
anywhere
else
and
obtain
a
war
of
any
kind,
not
on
my
superiors
handed
me
a
warrant
or
told
me
that
they
had
a
warrant.
when
i
pursued
in,
i
had
time
to
stop
and
obtain
a
warrant
if
i
had
wanted
to
do
it.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
and
get
a
warrant.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
so
there
is
evidence
in
the
brief
that
he
was
illegal
--
that
it
was
an
illegal
detention.
now,
the
judge
set
this
writ
of
habeas
corpus
hearing
found
for
2:30
on
september
the
15th.
in
a
few
minutes,
just
a
few
minutes
before
we
go
to
trial
and
hearing
the
writ,
it
was
announced
by
the
solicitor
that
the
grand
jury
has
indicted
the
appellant.
the
trial
judge
then
issued
a
bench
warrant
for
his
arrest.
he
issued
a
bench
warrant
although
he
had
been
in
the
jail
still
was
and
had
been
for
two
months
but
he
answered
the
bench
warrant
and
that
he
said,
"it
is
now
moot
because
i
just
issued
a
warrant."
they
waited
two
months.
they
do
what
they
should
have
done
two
months
previously.
now,
when
he
was
put
in
jail
and
questioned
for
six
--
for
seven
--
about
seven
hours
by
all
these
policemen,
deputy
sheriffs
forced
to
take
a
paraffin
test,
we
had
claimed
that
that
was
an
illegal
detention.
now,
it
is
very
worthy
and
worthwhile
to
notice
that
on
page
9
of
the
--
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
this
confession
--
to
me
this
is
very
important,
this
is
a
confession
that
they
got
from
this
boy.
i
have
been
advised
of
my
rights
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
on
page
9,
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
(inaudible)
number
first.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
"i
have
been
advised
of
my
rights
that
i
do
not
have
to
make
a
statement
of
any
kind,
that
any
statement
i
do
make
can
be
used
against
me
in
a
court."
the
plural
is
used,
"i
have
been
advised
that
my
rights,"
but
the
only
right
that's
in
there
recently,
it
doesn't
have
to
make
a
statement.
it
certainly
doesn't
say
anywhere
in
there
that
i
have
--
i
may
have
an
attorney
if
i
want
one.
it
says
nothing
about
that
whatsoever.
they
used
the
word
plural
rights
for
one
right
that
they
told
him
about.
they
did
not
tell
him
any
other
right
to
have
counsel.
now,
it
is
very
true
that
later
on,
somewhere
in
the
transcript
here,
when
he
was
being
questioned
by
the
state
solicitor,
one
of
them
said,
"oh,
yes,
we
asked
him
if
he
wants
a
lawyer
and
he
said
he
didn't
want
one."
but
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
that
confession
right
there
where
he
was
advised
of
his
rights."
we
advised
him
that
he
--
that
i
have
been
advised
that
i
have
a
right
to
have
a
counsel.
i
do
not
have
to
make
a
statement.
if
i
do
not
care
to
do
so,
if
i
had
it
in
all
there,
i
would
agree
to
it
but
it
doesn't
say
it
there."
and
that's
what
the
boy
signed
and
that's
why
we
have
to
go
on
then.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
but
says
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
in
the
lower
court?
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
oh,
i'm
sorry.
you
mean
on
this
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
you
mean
this
part
about
the
confession?
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
didn't
raise
it
as
saying
at
the
time
in
a
court
that
it
was
against
his
federal
rights.
if
that's
what
your
honor
mean.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
raised
it
all
the
way
through
it
because
a
lot
of
these
things,
your
honor,
we
didn't
know
about
until
afterwards.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
knew
about
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
objected
to
it.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
(voice
overlap)
being
admitted
into
evidence
because
it
was
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
of
being
--
its
confession
being
used
for
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
--
the
mistake
i
made
according
to
supreme
court
in
united
states
was
that
i
use
this
honorable
court's
rulings
and
two
federal
cases.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
on
page
76,
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia's
ruling
under
a.
it
says
that
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
those
were
the
same
cases
that
i
raised
the
issue
of
the
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
page
76,
your
honor,
a,
subject
a.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
although
--
that's
what
i
raised
your
honor,
and
they're
saying
that
--
that
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
this
particular
brief
available,
so
it's
in
this
--
that
was
sent
up
is
of
course
not
the
complete
one
and
i'm
going
to
have
--
to
be
sorry
to
say,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
just
where.
it
isn't
here.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
but
it
was
--
it
was
raised
about
those
federal
cases
as
being
inadmissible
along
--
in
the
record
that
i
said
it
was
so
inadmissible
on
all
of
those
facts.
now
one
of
the
main
things,
other
main
points
that
we
have
that
we
did
not
know
what
were
after.
the
trial
of
this
case
was
that
two
of
the
juror
men
that
tried
this
case
were
related
to
the
solicitor
that
was
to
the
prosecuting
attorney.
we
didn't
know
it
at
the
time
and
we
found
a
lot
after
the
trial.of
course,
it
was
well-known
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
a
third
chairman
was
related
to
the
sheriff
that
had
trusted
the
other.
now
there
again,
we
bring
him
to
supreme
court
of
georgia
into
this
as
being
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
only
two
things
that
the
judge
of
the
lower
court
in
his
order
overruling
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
bias
and
the
jury
who's
being
related
to
the
solicitor.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
held
--
literally
held
that
it's
perfectly
alright
for
--
to
have
12
jury
men
related
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
criminal
case.
of
course,
you
can't
do
it
in
a
civil
case
but
on
a
criminal
case
it's
perfectly
alright
because
he's
not
supposed
to
have
an
interest
in
the
case.
now
of
course,
i
don't
know
if
any
prosecuting
attorney
who
has
ever
run
the
clause,
this
doesn't
mean
they're
doing
everything
in
the
world
they
can
to
our
conviction.
and
i
would
say
that
any
jury
men
if
they're
related
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
did
not
know
it
then
i
certainly
would
not
say
if
that
was
an
impartial
jury
by
any
means.
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
constitution
for
an
impartial
jury
man
would
be
covered
by
saying
if
they
were
relative
to
other
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes
sir,
your
honor.
there
are
again
the
--
impermeably
honest,
the
supreme
--not
the
supreme
court
but
the
trial
judge
practically
set
out
a
line
but
i
didn't
ask
him.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
he
said
the
truth
i
didn't
ask
him
this
question.
i
asked
everyone
of
those
jury
men
because
i
knew
that
douglasville
is
a
small
town
about
3000
people
and
i
certainly
responded
enough
to
know
that
i
was
one
of
the
tough
time
getting
an
impartial
jury.
and
i
asked
each
one
of
them
a
series
of
questions,
one
of
them
was,
are
you
related
to
the
solicitor
or
to
anybody
sitting
at
his
table?
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
just
a
second,
your
honor.
i
will
cover
that
completely.
the
other
question
was
how
well
do
you
know
the
solicitor?
now,
the
states
all
fit
at
the
making
after
the
rehearing
--
the
hearing
for
motion
for
a
new
trial,
they
have
12
affidavits.one
from
each
one
of
the
jurors
stated
this
and
submitted
up
to
the
trial
judge.
in
those
12
affidavits,
it
says
this,
"they
all
admitted
that
i
asked
him
a
question
of
how
well
they
knew
the
solicitor."
one
of
them
said
that
i
asked
him
--
yes,
i
asked
him
if
he
was
related
by
blood
or
marriage.
another
one
said
he
wasn't
quite
sure.
however,
the
judge
in
his
order
overruling
the
most
of
a
new
trial
which
is
on
page
11
of
the
appellant's
brief,
the
court
finds
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
from
affidavits
of
the
12
jurors
sworn
who
tries
that
case
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
georgia
that
the
question,
are
you
related
to
the
solicitor
or
anyone
in
his
law
office
or
anyone
around
the
table
was
not
in
fact
and
in
truth
asked
of
the
said
jurors
individually
or
collectively
when
the
jurors
were
being
examined.
now,
the
problem
now
comes
up
though
that
we
do
not
have
those
affidavits
and
all
in
this
record
because
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
georgia
stopped
us
from
doing
it.
that's
another
one
of
our
grounds
for
asking
from
up
here,
where
this
had
gone
through.
when
i
have
time
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
this
appeal,
missing
parts,
there
were
some
missing
parts
missing.
now
of
course,
in
georgia,
the
lawyer
is
supposed
to
check
it
all.
that
was
my
fault.
i
make
no
comments
about
that.
that
was
my
mistake.
however,
there's
a
code
section
which
will
be
found
by
on
--
in
the
appellant's
brief,
on
page
4,
at
top
of
the
page,
which
says,
if
however
it
appears
the
appellate
court
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
page
4
your
honor.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes
sir.
on
top
of
the
page,
section
6-810
subsection
4.
if
however,
it
appears
to
the
appellate
court
an
argument
of
the
counsel
on
the
hearing
or
in
the
consideration
of
the
same
preparatory
in
making
up
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
any
part
or
portion
of
the
record
of
the
case
in
the
court
below
has
been
brought
up
and
such
--
has
not
been
brought
up
that
such
part
of
a
record
is
necessary
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
read
before
them
an
order
to
fully
and
fairly
adjudicate
the
question
of
issue
in
the
alleged
errors
then
the
court
show
by
its
order
directed
to
the
court
to
the
court
below
require
them
to
certify
and
send
up
such
portions
of
the
record.
as
in
the
opinion
of
appellate
court,
i
need
full
and
necessary
in
order
to
fully
and
fairly
adjudicate
the
errors
of
assignment.
now,
that
has
been
interpreted
word
per
word
as
a
must
on
the
supreme
court
by
chief
justice
duckworth
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
when
the
court
overrules
--
the
supreme
court
overruled
it
and
said
that
the
record
wasn't
up
there,
i
came
back
on
the
rehearing
and
asked
them
about
that
code
section
and
asked
to
send
out
and
have
it
sent
out.
now,
they
dilly-dally
around,
they
sat
down
to
the
lower
court
what
they
have
would
be
a
word
approved
brief
of
evidence.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
approved
brief
of
evidence.
if
you
have
the
approved
brief
of
evidence
down
below,
send
it
up.
if
you
don't,
let
us
know,
so
of
course,
the
court
down
below
said,
"yes,
we
have
all
these
affidavits
submitted
by
the
state
and
all
down
here,
but
they
haven't
--
they
haven't
approved.
they
don't
have
an
approved
by
the
judge.
so
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said,
"well,
if
they
aren't
approved
then
we
can't
force
them
to
set
up."
however,
in
atlantic
national
bank
versus
zinc,
they
held
it's
just
the
opposite
of
that,
which
is
cited
on
our
brief
there.
and
our
contention
is
that
the
only
two
things
that
that
lower
court
and
his
order
overruling
a
motion
from
a
new
trial,
the
only
two
things
that
he
mentions
both
retained
to
the
missing
parts
were
not
set
up.
that's
all
he
refers
to.
we
don't
refer
to
any
other
ground
behind
it,
just
so
as
two
grounds.
now,
how
in
the
world
can
a
supreme
court
rule
that
there
were
no
errors
in
the
trial
court
if
they
don't
have
any
forum
to
go
over
what
his
own
far
as
this?
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
of
course
the
--
our
careful
reading
of
the
--
the
record
here
or
not
the
record
but
our
saying
that's
referring
to
all
supreme
courts'
doings
about
this
will
show
that
the
judge
has
said
that
these
affidavits
were
kind
of
--
duly
and
timely
presented.
they
were
on
record
in
the
court
but
--
in
the
clerk's
office.
therefore,
it
--
i
just
cannot
understand
why
if
all
that
was
done
that
the
judge
gave
us
--
gave
the
state
and
myself
time
to
file
these
things
which
we
did
file,
which
he
turns
around
his
ordinances
that
he
gave
us
time
and
they
were
duly
and
timely
presented.
they
were
filed
on
the
clerk's
office.
why
anybody
could
say
enough
by
the
record?
now,
i
just
don't
understand
when
the
whole
order
that
the
judge
writes
is
on
that
final
record
and
nothing
else.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
(inaudible)
said
that
i
did
not
ask
them
whether
they
were
related
to
the
solicitor.
what
i've
said
i
did
ask
him
if
--
if
he
was
related
to
the
solicitor
and
once
that
he
wasn't
quite
sure,
but
everyone
of
them,
everyone
of
those
12
said
yes,
i
did
ask
them
the
question,
how
well
do
you
know
mr.
noland,
the
solicitor.
and
it's
my
contention
if
i
ask
a
man
how
well
do
you
know
john
jones,
he's
a
brother
of
his.
he
ought
to
come
out
and
say,
"well,
i
all
know
him
well
pretty
good,
he's
my
brother."
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
second
or
third
cousins.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes
sir,
which
in
the
civil
angle
in
--
that
the
supreme
court
held
in
georgia,
he
would
be
incompetent.
well
in
the
criminal
case,
he
would
not
be.
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
that
your
honor,
their
answer
was
simply
what
any
man
would
say,
i
know
him
pretty
well,
or
i've
seen
him
around
town,
or
i
have
been
with
him
for
a
while
or
something,
i
met
him
at
large,
or
something
like
that.
there
was
no
indication
that
they
were
close
at
all
in
any
way.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
my
contention
is
that
the
fair
and
impartial
trial
is
just
as
much
on
the
part
of
the
state,
prosecutors
to
give
you
that
fair
(inaudible).
and
all
do
respect
to
mr.
noland,
i
think
that
he
knew
they
were
relatives
of
his
and
they
should
have
searched
them,
because
that's
no
way
to
convict
the
person
if
i
have
relatives
on
the
witness
stand
or
on
the
jury.
i
--
i
say
that
anybody
who
was
guilty,
if
they've
given
all
their
fair
just
rights
under
our
way
of
law
and
then
a
jury
comes
back
and
finds
him
guilty,
that's
the
way
we
have
it
in
the
united
states
but
i
don't
feel
that
there
should
be
any
conniving
or
having
jury
men
or
anything
else
to
convict
the
person.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
chief
justice
warren.
i
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
your
honor
pleases,
on
page
--
starting
at
page
26
of
the
record,
going
over
to
the
top
part
of
page
27
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
would
like
to
read
the
actual
questions
and
answers
which
said,
is
just
the
answers
there,
but
surely
exactly,
what
was
said
in
the
court
about
the
warrant.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
said
to
him
after
things
there
are
--
i
just
answer
my
question
and
his
answer
was,
"i
did
not
have
a
warrant."
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
the
only
thing
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
the
only
thing
chief
justice
warren
that
i
can
say
is
that,
that
whole
questioning
and
answering
there,
it
was
all
brought
out
and
that
part
right
there
about
never
being
taken,
never
having
a
warrant
and
never
being
taken
before
a
committing
magistrate.
now,
it
is
very
true
as
mr.
winn
said
that
the
day
following
all
of
this
imprisonment
and
questioning
for
seven
hours
by
a
group
of
men
and
all,
the
following
day,
on
the
18th
of
--
of
july,
1958
it
is
true
that
the
brother
of
the
murdered
man
did
go
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
take
out
a
warrant.
that
is
very
true
but
he
was
never
carried
back
before
that
justice
of
the
peace
as
that
more
specifically
said,
bring
him
before
me.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
raised
it,
your
honor,
in
all
questioning
of
these
arresting
officers.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
it's
in
--
it's
in
there,
your
honor
and
i
am
sorry
but
the
--
that
particular
court
reporter
is
a
very
elderly
man.
there
are
lots
of
mistakes
in
there,
but
it
has
to
go
but
what
was
set
up
there,
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
the
coercion
of
it
is
likewise
where
mental
coercion
to
me
would
be
where
the
boy
was
arrested.
a
19-year
old
boy
arrested
and
thrown
in
jail
and
questioned
by
a
group
of
officers,
forced
to
take
a
paraffin
test,
not
told
of
his
right
to
have
a
lawyer,
contradictory
to
that
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
your
honor
--
if
your
honor
pleases,
as
i
said
yesterday
and
i
would
like
very
empathetically
to
repeat
it
today
before
this
honorable
court,
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
boy
or
a
man
or
anybody
sign
something
and
you
simply
say
at
the
start
of
it,
my
name
is
billy
ferguson.
i
hereby
make
this
to
my
own
free
will.
i
have
been
advised
of
my
rights
that
i
do
not
have
to
make
a
statement.
now,
if
you
want
to
have
a
man
sign
that
and
then
you
want
to
turn
around
later
on
after
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
taken
out,
nothing
else
and
say
that
he
wasn't
taken
before
magistrate
and
then
have
a
man
get
up
on
the
witness
stand
and
by
the
questioning
of
the
solicitor
say,
"yes,
we
told
him
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
counsel,"
i
think
it
should
have
been
incorporated
in
their
confession,
if
he
really
said
it.
the
confession
is
what
i
am
going
at.
i
am
going
at
with
what
boy
signed
and
he
did
agree,
he
signed
that
he
was
told
his
right
that
he
did
not
have
to
make
a
confession
and
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
most
assuredly,
am.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
most
assuredly
am.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
and
he
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
and
he
never
--
he
never
--
in
that
statement,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he
does
not
say
that
i
haven't
told
him
my
rights
to
have
counsel.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
my
evidence,
your
honor,
is
the
theoretical
evidence
that
he
was
arrested
and
lodged
in
jail
and
questioned
for
seven
hours,
mentally
coerced,
is
what
i
am
saying
for.
he
was
mentally
coerced.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
it's
throughout
the
whole
record.
there's
no
contradiction
of
it.
it's
throughout
the
record
that
he
was
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
that
he
wasn't
--
that
he
wasn't
mentally
coerced
except
to
say
that
he
was
advised
of
his
right
to
have
counsel
and
i
say
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
that's
very
true.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
but
your
honor,
i
did
not
raise
it
as
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
your
honor
pleases,
i
agree
wholeheartedly
with
mr.
winn
that
perhaps
the
only
real
constitutional
question
that
was
raised
in
the
lower
court,
raised
let's
say
properly
and
effectively
and
everything
else
was
code
section
38-415.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
and
if
that
is
the
--
the
way
of
this
honorable
court,
i
certainly
am
not
going
to
tell
this
honorable
court
what
the
rule
or
what
not
the
rule,
what
you
have
a
right
to
and
which
you
don't
have
a
right
to.
you
can
--
you
handle
it
the
way
you
see
fit
and
that's
probably
alright
with
me
and
if
i
did,
put
something
in
there
that
should
have
been
there,
i
certainly
by
no
meant
to
mislead
this
honorable
court.
i
was
only
giving
all
the
facts
of
the
whole
case.
i
thought
perhaps,
it
may
have
been
(inaudible)
to
have
all
the
facts
before
in
the
manner
of
how
you
ruled
on
it.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
so,
let's
if
--
if
your
honor
pleases,
then
let's
take
this
code
section
that
we
have
--
that
we
will
say
is
properly
before
this
court.
and
it's
my
opinion
that
the
--
that
is
definitely
unconstitutional.
i
have
two
points,
under
the
due
process
clause
and
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution.
and
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
that
we
submit
to
this
honorable
court,
that
the
meaning
of
this
code
section
and
i
want
empathetically
bring
this
to
your
attention
because
the
state
in
their
brief
says
that
i
attempt
for
the
first
time
to
bring
it
forward
and
that
is
the
discretionary
part
of
the
judge.
it
is
the
state
of
georgia,
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
that
in
their
ruling
on
a
constitutionality
of
that
question,
it
was
not
me,
it
was
them
who
used
the
only
citation
that
they
referred
to
was
corbin
versus
state.
now,
if
they
are
saying
that
we
said
is
constitutional
and
we
put
it
as
our
authority,
corbin
versus
the
state,
212
ga.
231,
there
we
will
have
to
look
at
that
to
see
where
--
what
they
are
saying
and
under
heading
seven
of
that
particular
case,
they
said
this,
"his
counsel
has
no
right
to
ask
him
questions
while
he
is
making
the
statement.
the
trial
judge
however,
in
his
discretion
can
permit
his
counsel
to
ask
him
questions
or
make
suggestions
to
him
relating
to
a
statement
while
he
is
making
it."
therefore,
that
is
the
ruling
of
this
constitutional
question
that
they
are
saying,
a
lawyer
cannot
ask
a
defendant
any
question.
however,
it
is
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge.
so
it
was
not
raised
for
the
first
time
in
my
brief,
it
was
raised
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
their
ruling
in
the
constitutionality
of
this
case.
because
that
is
the
only
case
that
they
cite.
they
cite
no
other.
now,
we
submit
therefore,
to
interpret
this
code
section
to
be
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge
would
absolutely
be
discriminatory.
and
it
would
deny
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
that
are
given
to
some
criminals
in
georgia
and
denied
to
others.
and
as
this
court
held
on
page
8
of
my
brief,
i
set
forth
in
missouri
versus
lewis,
"equal
protection
of
the
laws
means
no
person
shall
be
denied
the
same
protection
of
the
laws
which
is
enjoyed
by
other
persons
in
the
same
place
and
under
like
certain
circumstances."
also
this
honorable
court
held
in
griffin
versus
the
people
of
the
state
of
illinois,
in
351
u.s.
12,
where
it
was
said,
constitutional
guarantees
of
this
clause
and
equal
protection,
both
call
for
procedures
in
criminal
trials
which
allow
no
invidious
discrimination
between
persons
or
different
groups
of
persons.
both
equal
protection
and
this
clause
emphasize
the
central
aim
of
judicial
system
that
all
people
charged
with
crime
must
stand
on
an
equality
before
the
bar
of
justice.
that
is
my
contention
that
not
only
does
it
deny
him
the
right
of
counsel,
but
to
say
that
the
discretion
--
it
is
discretionary
where
the
trial
judge
is
certainly
not
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
i
do
not.
i
think,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
that
is
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
nothing
to
do
with
it
because
that
simply
says,
he
is
not
competent
as
a
witness.
that
is
only
saying
he
cannot
be
sworn
and
as
i
said
yesterday
in
the
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
well
i'm
sorry.
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
you,
is
this
what
you
meant
by
that.
what
i
meant
was
that
is
not
involved
right
here.
certainly,
i
do
--
pardon
me.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no.
i
--
i
must
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
misunderstood
what
mr.
justice
harlan
asked.
this
is
what
i
meant
that
it
was
not
in
this
case,
those
i'm
not
referring
to
it
at
all.
certainly,
that
particular
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
it's
not
called
on
this
case
anyway.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
my
case
is
415.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
well,
my
case
is
that
i
think
that
to
deny,
in
the
state
of
georgia
to
deny
a
defendant
on
a
criminal
case,
the
right
to
get
up
on
the
stand
and
give
the
evidence
for
or
against
himself,
makes
no
difference
in
his
behalf
and
to
the
questioned
by
his
own
counsel
to
be
given
assistance
and
benefit
by
his
own
counsel.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
want
to
be
sure,
i
understand
it.
now
you
mean
that
if
they
had
416,
sir?
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
still
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i'd
still
say
it
was
unconstitutional.
yes,
sir.
i
most
assuredly,
would
say,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
--
if
415
was
not
on
the
books
or
was
declared
to
be
invalid,
then
the
time
would
have
to
come
when
we
have
to
go
on,
take
up
the
situation
of
416.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
i
never
did.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
in
--
in
this
particular
before
this
honorable
court
right
now,
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
because
they
said
that's
against
the
law
in
georgia.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
16
weren't
on
the
book?
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
he
was
a
competent
witness,
i
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
he's
not
a
competent
witness
because
of
416,
is
very
true.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
well,
as
i
keep
saying
justice
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
as
i
meant,
i
did
not
bring
up
416,
that's
all
i
am
saying.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
but
they
say
it
doesn't
have
anything
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
they
say
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
of
course,
it
has
something
to
do
with
it
just
as
--
as
another
code
section
that
i
told
yesterday.
i
told
this
honorable
court
yesterday
about
the
changing
of
1951
to
say
that
for
a
adult,
they
can
be
competent.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
is
partially
right
if
i
may
say
so.
on
this
--
in
this
respect,
that
i
am
saying
that
the
interpretation,
the
interpretation
and
construction
given
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
to
code
section
38-415
saying
that
he
has
no
right
to
have
any
benefit
of
counsel.
i
am
saying
that
that
is
unconstitutional.
i
am
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
in
my
view,
if
he
was
given
the
assistance
of
on
benefit
of
counsel
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
he
was
allowed
to
do
that,
fully
allowed
to
do
it,
i
would
say
that
would
be
his
–
he
\would
have
the
benefit
of
counsel.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
oath
would
have
the
sole
bearing
under
that
and
i
think
it's
a
part
of
denying
him
the
right
to
--
to
have
assistance
of
the
counsel.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
that
the
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
not
hold
his
hands
but
assist
him.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
if
he
has
a
very
--
if
his
tongue
is
tied
in
a
slur,
they
can't
talk,
he's
nervous
or
something
else,
then
help
him
out.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
i
did
not
because
that
i
know
has
been
held
on
numerous
occasions
in
georgia
that
you
cannot
ask
to
be
sworn.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
sir.
i
did
not.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
that's
right.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
he
is
denied
the
right
and
benefit
of
counsel
to
help
him
out.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
mr.
justice
black,
as
i
said
yesterday,
i
would
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
i
said
that
it
is
--
is
unconstitutional
on
the
face
of
that
particular
code
section
--
that
particular
code
section.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
no,
it
doesn't
say
in
that
code
section
about
the
--
anything
except
requesting
on
his
counsel's
part.
it
says
he
shall
not
be
subject
to
cross-examination,
but
it
does
not
say
anything
about
asking
him
any
questions
by
his
own
counsel.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
that's
right.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
and
they
have
also
--
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir
and
in
the
sense
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge
goes
a
step
further.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
that
is
saying
that
it's
up
to
him
--
that
the
trial
judge
to
decide
whether
he
shall
have
the
benefit
of
counsel
or
not.
mr.
paul
james
maxwell
yes,
sir.
it's
up
to
the
judge.
judge
can
say,
yes,
you
can
help
this
client
and
the
other
lawyer,
you
can't
help
that
client.
and
that
to
me
would
be
entirely
discretionary
and
discriminatory.
also
i
said
yesterday,
i
certainly
would
far
rather
for
the
sake
of
the
state
and
for
the
sake
of
the
defendant
to
have
the
thing
that
he
is
just
like
it
is
in
federal
court
or
any
other
court.
that
would
be
the
far
better
way
to
get
to
real
justice
would
be
held
like
every
other
state
has
it
and
like
the
federal
court
has
it.
but
that
will
be
something
the
legislature
would
have
to
enact
at
and
i
think
they
would
do
it
immediately
if
anything
has
ever
happened
to
code
section
38-415,
because
even
a
trial
judge
here,
it
says
no
matter
however
logical
they
all
feel
that
way
about
it.
it
would
be
much
better.
thank
you
very
much.
