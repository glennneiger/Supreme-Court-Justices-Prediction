what's
the
fact
here?
did
they
usually
exercise
their
discretion
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
it
varies
from
judge
to
judge?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
is
the
relationship
the
one
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
second
or
third
cousins
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
consider
that
--
that
this
man
had
tendered
himself
as
a
witness
or
merely
that
tendered
himself
under
your
38-415
provision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
he
ask?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
consider
that
the
constitutionality
of
38-416
is
involved
in
your
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
were
not
seeking
to
put
your
man
on
the
stand
as
a
general
witness.
you
were
seeking
to
put
him
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
let
me
put
this
to
you.
supposing
georgia
has
had
no
416,
that
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
could
it
be
so
vague
to
take
the
witness
stand
like
any
other
person
but
that
it
also
had
415,
would
you
be
arguing
that
415
was
unconstitutional
in
those
circumstances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
say
if
they
--
if
there
was
no
--
no
disqualification
on
a
criminal
defendant
from
taking
the
witness
stand,
but
georgia
in
addition
said,
"we
will
give
a
criminal
defendant
the
right
to
make
an
unsworn
statement
subject
to
the
qualifications
that
he's
not
going
to
have
a
lawyer
aid
in
making
that
statement
and
he's
to
be
subject
to
no
cross-examination
as
he
consents.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
say
that
act
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
why
you're
saying
that
you
don't
lay
any
--
pay
any
attention
to
--
in
your
argument
to
whether
416
is
on
the
books
or
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
i
cannot
find
anything
in
your
papers
or
in
the
record
that
indicates
to
me
that
you
ever
raised
the
constitutionality
of
416.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you're
saying
here
that
that
416,
plays
no
part
in
your
own
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
more
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
ask
the
court
to
permit
your
man
to
be
sworn
through
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
was
did
you
ask?
