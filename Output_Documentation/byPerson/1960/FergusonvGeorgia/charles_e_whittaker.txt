justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he's
told?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
the
judge
have,
if
he
allowed
some
questions
to
be
asked
by
defense
counsel,
would
he
then
also
be
able
to
allow
the
prosecutor
to
ask
some
questions
of
this
defendant?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
the
statute
said
that
he
--
the
defendant
could
not
be
cross
examined.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
that
section
38416
one
following
the
one
you've
read
makes
of
such
an
accuse
than
incompetent
witness,
but
under
the
preceding
section,
he
maybe
likes
to
get
on
the
stand
but
not
as
witness,
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
make
any
statement
he
wants.
but,
he
cannot
be
cross
examined.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
right?
now,
wouldn't
it
be
a
little
bit
in
congress
for
a
witness
to
be
allowed
to
be
examined
on
direct
by
his
own
counsel
and
still
not
to
allow
any
cross-examination
of
him?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
your
statement
and
your
conclusion
would
make
of
the
accuse
defendant,
a
competent
but
not
a
compellable
witness,
is
that
your
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
said
both
sections
of
lawyers,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
hasn't
advised
him
counsel
from
him
--
from
his
lawyer
before
he
gets
on
the
stand
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
only
that
he
can't
be
examined
there.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
would
you
allow
full
examination
--
you
think
he
has
to
have
a
full
examination
and
cross-examination?
full,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
those
were
affidavits
by
the
jurors?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
all
said
that
you
had
not
asked
these
questions?
