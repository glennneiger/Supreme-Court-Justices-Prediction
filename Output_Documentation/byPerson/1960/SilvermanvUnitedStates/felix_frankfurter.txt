that
is
not
the
search
warrant
itself.
that's
the
descript
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
annexed
--
that
was
annexed
to
your
motion
for
suppression.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
significance
that
either
judge
holtzoff
or
the
court
of
appeals
attached
to
the
consent
given
by
the
contiguous
--
the
owner
of
the
contiguous
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
read
it
awhile
ago
that
one
of
the
opinions
stated
that
"with
the
consent
of."
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
sticking
this
thing
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
williams,
may
i
revert
to
my
question
about
consent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
indicating
whether
it
does
or
doesn't
have
significance
to
the
other
questions,
but
if
consent
was
given
to
enter
and
was
it
known
that
these
were
enforcing
officers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
suppose
it
takes
much
of
the
slide
to
say
that
if
consent
was
given
to
officers
to
come
into
the
house,
did
that
kind
lenders
the
consent
to
do
what
they
were
coming
in
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
if
that
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
going
onto
the
significance
but,
so
far
as
any
consent
is
relevant
in
the
relevant
item
in
the
equation,
the
total
equation,
i
should
think
the
consent
of
entry
would
carry
with
it
what
they
entered
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
to
his
part
of
this
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would've
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
the
consent
--
there
was
consent
for
them
consequently,
but
there
was
consent
to
the
physical
thing
that
was
done
on
his
half.
i
suppose
a
man
could
fiddle
around
so
long
as
he
doesn't
undermine
the
--
the
existence
of
the
next
house
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
part
of
the
house
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
further.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
always
interested
when
counsel
resort
to
some
statement
in
the
prior
brief
by
counsel.
what
is
it,
is
it
a
theory
of
estoppel?
after
all,
counsel
want
to
win
the
case
before
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
you've
done
it
again
and
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
if
you're
going
to
get
--
put
a
--
call
a
--
put
a
cradle,
the
solicitor
general
wrote
a
bridge
for
his
name
so
that
the
presence
of
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
come
into
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
character
conditions
to
foresight
his
predecessor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
just
little
private
things,
but
i'm
constantly
--
i
hear
this
constantly
from
lawyers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pull
out
a
brief
from
a
prior
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
a
great
deal
of
extra
line,
i
don't
know
what
they
do
with
their
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
exact
length
of
the
party
wall
established
on
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
said
beyond
14,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we'll
have
a
seven
and
an
eighth
will
be
more
than
half
of
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
would
be
an
eighth
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
trespass,
to
the
extent
of
eighth
--
one
eighth
of
an
inch,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
wouldn't
that
be
one-eighth
anyhow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
one-eighth
exempt
for
your
purposes,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
purpose
of
trespass,
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
that
de
minimis?
is
that
de
minimis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
tell
a
fellow
who's
stupid
about
these
things
how
could
it
come
in
contact
with
the
heating
register
unless
it
got
beyond
the
eighth
inch
--
one-eighth
of
an
inch?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
may
merely
show
that
i'm
ignorant,
not
that
you
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
the
heating
duct
of
--
of
the
petitioners'
house
go
to
the
half
of
the
contiguous
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
it
must
have
been
an
entirely
on
the
--
on
the
petitioner's
premises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
must
have
been
--
then,
the
contact
must
have
shown,
in
it
of
itself,
some
trespass
if
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
heating
duct
wasn't
on
the
--
on
the
house
from
which
they
were
operating,
it
must
have
been
on
the
other
house
and,
therefore,
the
other
house
couldn't
have
been
the
contiguous
house.
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
your
--
your
argument
--
this
argument
challenges
the
foundation
of
olmsted,
namely,
that
there
is
no
search
unless
there
is
really
a
physical
entry
--
an
unallowed
physical
entry
into
the
premises
from
which
you
get
information.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
that's
what
it
amounts
to,
your
challenge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
necessary
to
overrule
olmsted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you're
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
answer
to
justice
harlan,
you
were
concerned
merely
with
the
ear.
what
about
the
eye?
what
about
visual?
if
i
may
take
your
figure
of
speech,
because
you
talk
about
invasion
is
a
figure
of
speech,
what
about
visual
ascertaining?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
though
that
--
let's
speculate
because
i'm
certainly
i'm
no
good
at
it,
but
with
a
telescope
you
can
see
things
that
you
can't
see
with
the
naked
eye.
what
about
using
a
telescope
to
look
into
the
rule
across
the
street?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
one
has
to
know
where
you
go
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
then
suggesting
that,
in
determining
these
things,
we
should
consider
to
what
extent
you
can
isolate
yourself
against
outside
of
contrusion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
people
who've
got
nice
traits
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
people
who've
got
nice
traits
are
protected
but
the
people
who
just
have
poor,
cheap
curtains
on,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
mean
it
might
prove
telescope
that
it
might
get
visual
penetration
in
the
means
that
are
effective
for
the
eye
as
they
are
for
the
ear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
but
not
a
thing
that
may
well
be
now
on
the
market
or
surely
will
be,
whereby
it
can
penetrate
the
shade
that
you
pull
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
that's
not
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
you
have
to
meet
justice
harlan's
question
beyond
the
answer
that
you
gave
because,
as
you
suggest,
congress
tomorrow
might
provide
for
authorization
for
a
search
warrant.
and,
there,
it
was
a
problem
with
the
constitutionality
of
such
law
(inaudible)
authorization.
just
go
beyond
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
saying
that
on
the
present
--
under
the
present
authorization
of
search
warrants,
a
search
warrant
wouldn't
be
issued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it
isn't
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
then
it
isn't
a
question
of
choice
for
this
court
that
congress
passes
the
statute
to
authorize
it,
so
that
you
will
go
back
upon
the
proper
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
if
this
court
wants
or
doesn't
want.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
in
the
--
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
--
but
if
your
argument
is
that
this
falls
by
virtue
of
the
fourth
amendment,
is
that
right?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
argue
that
it
falls
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and,
one
--
one
consents
--
on
amendment
is
enough
in
order
to
try
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
is
true,
then
how
do
you
differentiate
the
case
put
by
justice
harlan,
whether
have
an
issue
of
the
warrant
for
snooping
purposes
or
merely
for
confirmatory
of
cumulative
evidence?
why
do
you
make
a
distinction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that's
your
view,
then
the
short
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question,
if
i
may
say
so,
in
your
point
of
view
is
that
if
congress
couldn't
authorize
it,
it
couldn't
be
done
without
authorization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
for
snooping
for
--
concerning
snooping
or
whatnot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
save
same
time
and
not
to
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
--
you
go
there
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
if
you
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
take
that
time
and
deal
with
the
question
of
mcnabb
because
you've
raised
that.
you
said,
a
minute
ago,
even
if
you
--
even
if
this
is
not
a
--
there's
no
constitutional
barrier,
you
can
invoke.
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court,
do
you
mind
saying
something
about
that
in
your
remaining
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
necessarily
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
necessarily
usable
only
for
illicit
purposes
or
purposes
which
you
wouldn't
defend?
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
mean
you
are
legally
defending
it
what
they're
used
for.
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
couldn't
i
use
it
in
the
large
house
just
the
way
they
use
them
in
intra-telephones?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
you
are
defending
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
please
free
me
up.
you
started
out
what
--
what
was
your
opening
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
wouldn't
something
have
to
be
in
the
petitioner's
part
of
the
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
wall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
that
if
it
was
just
been
inserted
one
inch
in
the
neighboring
house,
the
sound
--
the
sound
would
have
been
amplified
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
have
say
that
--
you
could
have
said
that
to
the
extent
to
which
amplification
is
made
for
the
--
the
sounds
are
more
distinguished
and
one
hears
it
from
across
house
to
house
or,
across
apartment
to
apartment.
at
least,
clearly
you
would
say
that's
outside
the
scope
of
all
the
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
seem
to
have
a
kind
of
fun
with
this
instrument.
[laughs]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
suggestion
--
the
suggestion
of
your
admonition
to
the
court
or
your
helpless
suggestion
to
the
court
is
that
we
ought
not
to
outlaw
cruel
things
but
merely
very
refined
instruments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
one
wouldn't
be
borrowing
sublet
when
assumed
that
there'll
be
improvements
on
these
things
that
their
legitimate
does,
does
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything
heard
from
the
second
floor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
noises
come
from
the
room
into
which
or
toward
which
the
spike
was
projected
or
from
the
room
above?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
length
of
time
did
the
--
did
the
overheard
conversations
take
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
recordings
that
were
made
of
the
overheard
conversation
voluminous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
or
recollection,
were
they
voluminous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
agents
relied
solely
on
their
memory
for
what
they
heard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
were
the
notes
voluminous?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
was
just
to
the
house.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
point
was
that
it
wasn't
the
house,
the
home
where
people
lived,
in
the
hester
case,
was
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
point
is
that
the
protection
is
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
say
as
the
party
wall
is
part
of
the
house,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
the
hester
case,
wasn't
thinking
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
first
sentence
wouldn't
satisfy
draper,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
you
suggested
about
embarking
and
showing
that
it's
--
there's
no
other
way
of
dealing
with
this
kind
of
united
social
conduct.
the
search
warrant
was
based
on
this
instrument
we
used
on
higher
knowledge
or
belief,
namely,
reliable
sources
arouse
suspicion
but
they
must
have
known
something.
this
kind
of
business
is
carried
on
either
by
people
going
there
through
the
telephone.
the
people
go
there
in
numbers.
you
said
there
were
quite
a
number,
a
hundreds
of
them,
whatever
there
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
steady
stream
of
people
who
were
supposed
to
be
at
home
raises
the
possibilities
for
inventing
detectors
to
pursue
and,
if
it's
over
the
telephone,
there
are
other
means
of
finding
out
what
this
kind
of
heavy
traffic
over
the
phone
does.
simply
suggest
even
assuming
that
he's
got
with
extra
set
of
copies,
i
just
wonder
how
much
of
this
thing
is
--
the
characteristic
easy
way
of
getting
information
instead
of
using
brains,
instead
of
devices
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there
was
a
telephone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there
was
a
telephone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
find
out
--
it's
not
for
me
just
to
suggest,
so
i'd
rather
just
make
a
venture.
if
the
tele
--
if
the
phones
come
at
certain
hours
on
certain
days
within
a
framework
of
interest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
sorts
of
thoughts
can
arise
to
a
fellow
which
prevented
from
doing
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
my
starting
point
is
the
starting
point
of
the
affidavit,
reliable
source.
they
must
have
known
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
know
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
know
that,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
enables
them,
if
it's
--
if
it's
horse
races
and
baseball
games,
that
already
limits
still
the
area
of
inquiry
or
points
it
up
to
where
it
can
be
pursued
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
good
sniffing
can
be
technical
deal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
since
you
rely
on
that
report,
more
needs
to
be
said
about
it.
first
and
foremost,
no
such
tapping
is
authorized
in
england,
except
by
the
person,
i
emphasize,
the
person
who
associates
the
permission.
the
second,
they
have
state
for
home
affairs.
he's
the
third
most
important
member
of
the
cabinet.
he
personally
is
responsible
for
it.
he's
responsibly
in
the
house
of
commons
to
defend
it.
and,
if
you
--
since
you
read
the
report,
you
know
how
few
such
permissions
are
given.
they're
almost
negligible
in
number.
all
of
which
is
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
we
--
we
had
the
kind
of
positions
they
had,
an
officer
who's
in
the
position
of
the
home
secretary,
as
i
say,
the
third
important
--
he
holds
the
third
--
most
important
post
to
the
british
government
and
he
himself,
on
his
own
conscience,
responsible
for
the
questioning
of
the
house
of
commons,
must
give
this
permission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
then,
as
you
know,
there's
a
great
deal
of
galop
in
the
racecar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
any
number?
have
you
got
it
in
number?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
find
out
what
permission
he
gave
or
what
mr.
hoover
does?
can
anybody
find
out?
you
know
very
well
he
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
these
are
statements
holds
there.
these
arose
--
the
report
what
you
have
in
your
hand
arose
out
of
a
specific
case.
it
was
so
aroused
the
concern
of
the
british
public
that
they
had
a
two-day
debate
in
the
house
of
commons
which
resulted
in
its
very
way
you
report
by
the
imminent
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
report
say
to
carry
this
report
down
to
what
happened
very
recently,
early
this
year
at
least,
namely,
one
of
these
authorizations
was
given.
it
was
in
connection
with
a
member
of
the
medical
profession
who,
on
the
basis
of
the
disclosures
found,
reported
by
the
home
office,
but
the
medical
society
expelled
him.
there
was
another
hullabaloo
and
there
was
another
report
and
the
conclusion
was
that
what
was
obtained
by
these
--
in
these
rare
instances
was
not
to
be
given
no
matter
how
laudable
the
purpose
to
any
other
agent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
a
question
as
well
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
question
of
what
security
you
have
as
against
ours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
much
more
optimistic
about
that
than
i
have
reason
to
believe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
mr.
dasher's
report
concluded,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
a
very
good
reason
which
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
probably
know
is
well
provided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
it's
held
to
the
extensiveness
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
outlawed,
it's
used
by
private
people
altogether,
haven't
they?
people
are
being
sent
to
jail
in
new
york
for
private
detection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
whether
--
repelled,
whether
the
basis
of
allowing
wiretapping
on
by
the
department
of
justice
is
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
or
other
categories
of
crime?
