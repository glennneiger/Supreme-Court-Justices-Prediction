mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
that's
presented
to
the
court
in
the
case
at
bar
concerns
the
admissibility
of
evidence
in
federal
courts.
precisely
stated,
the
question
is
whether
evidence
which
is
obtained
by
agents
of
the
federal
government
by
the
use
of
this
electronic
eavesdropping
device
which
his
known
as
a
spike
microphone
which
was
inserted
into
the
party
wall
of
the
private
dwelling
house
of
petitioners
so
that
all
of
the
conversations
which
took
place
in
that
dwelling
house
over
a
period
of
days
could
be
overheard
by
the
federal
agents,
whether
evidence
of
that
kind
may
be
offered
against
the
petitioners
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
the
facts
are
these,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
this
is
precisely
the
device,
your
honor.
the
facts
are
these.
in
july
of
1958,
the
petitioners
were
indicted
for
violation
of
the
gambling
statutes
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
for
violation
of
the
federal
gambling
tax
act.
the
indicted
sounded
in
four
counts.
they
charged
the
petitioners,
in
substance,
with
accepting
over
the
telephone
wagers
on
baseball
games
and
boxing
matches.
it
charged
that
these
were
accepted
in
a
row
house
at
408
21st
street,
northwest
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
house
was
a
two-story
dwelling
house
with
four
rooms,
two
upstairs
and
two
downstairs.
on
april
30
of
1958,
a
search
was
made
of
these
premises
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
issued
by
the
united
states
commissioner
for
the
district
of
columbia.
as
a
result
of
that
search,
certain
records
were
seized
and
certain
--
certain
paraphernalia
were
seized.
the
search
warrant
was
issued,
if
the
court
please,
on
an
affidavit
that
was
signed
by
two
agents
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
service
and
by
an
officer
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
and,
it
alleged
in
essence
that
over
a
period
of
nine
days
from
april
21
to
april
30,
from
a
vantage
point,
otherwise
unidentified,
they
were
able
to
overhear
conversations
in
which
the
petitioners
were
engaged
and
which
they
characterized
as
wagering
conversations.
a
motion
was
filed
under
rule
41
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
for
the
return
and
the
suppression
of
evidence,
for
the
return
of
the
physical
object
seized
in
their
suppression,
and
for
the
suppression
of
the
conversations
overheard
on
the
ground
that
they
were
in
violation
of
petitioners'
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
that
motion
came
on
for
hearing
before
judge
holtzoff
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
at
the
hearing,
a
stipulation
was
entered
into
by
counsel
for
the
government
with
counsel
for
the
defense
that
agents
of
the
federal
government
had
gone
onto
the
premises
at
410
21st
street
which
was
the
row
house
immediately
contiguous
to
the
petitioners'
that
they
have
gone
unto
those
premises
with
the
consent
of
the
owner
and
that,
by
use
of
this
microphone,
they
had
overheard
the
conversations
which
were
spelled
out
in
the
affidavit
on
which
the
search
warrant
was
issued.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
hope
it's
not
an
assembly
line
article,
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
it
is
an
article
which
has
some
widespread
use
at
the
present
time
by
federal
law
enforcement
agents.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
does,
sir.
the
affidavit
appears
in
the
record
next
to
the
motion
for
the
return
suppression
of
evidence.
it
appears,
mr.
justice
stewart,
at
page
12
of
the
record.
now,
the
stipulation
entered
into
before
the
judge
on
the
motion
was
to
the
effect
that
this
device
was
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
the
effort
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
that
was
annexed,
if
the
court
please,
to
the
original
application
for
a
search
warrant
made
by
the
officers
who
applied
for
it.
that
was
the
affidavit
on
which
the
search
warrant
was
issued
by
the
united
states
commissioner
on
april
30,
1958.
we
annexed
it
as
an
exhibit
to
our
moving
papers
because
we
were
making
the
constitutional
argument.
it
was
further
stipulated
that
this
was
inserted
below
the
baseboard
for
a
distance
of
six
or
seven
inches
into
the
party
wall
of
petitioners'
dwelling
house
and
that
it
was
the
means
by
which
the
conversations
were
overheard.
judge
holtzoff
denied
the
motion
for
return
and
suppression
and
i
think
it
is
germane
here
to
read
just
a
sentence
of
his
opinion
or
two.
he
said,
"by
permission
of
the
owner,"
and
i'm
reading
from
page
20
of
the
record,
"police
officers
obtained
entrance
to
a
portion
of
the
premises
which
adjoined
the
search
premises,
and
attached
an
electronic
device
to
the
inside
wall
of
the
adjoining
premises
with
a
wire
projecting
six
or
eight
inches
into
the
party
wall
between
the
two
houses.
by
means
of
this
electronic
device,
the
officers
were
able
to
overhear
conversations
that
went
on
in
the
suspected
premises.
these
conversations
were
made
the
basis
of
the
affidavit
in
question."
and
then,
below
on
the
same
page,
he
gives
us
the
reason
for
his
denial
of
the
motion
before
him."
the
provisions
of
the
fourth
amendment
relating
to
search
and
seizure
are
limited
to
physical
searches
and
seizures
of
objects.
this
has
been
continuously
held
by
the
supreme
court.
thus,
in
olmstead
against
the
united
states,
the
court
laid
down
the
general
proposition
that
if
evidence
is
obtained
by
use
of
sense
of
hearing
and
that
only,
and
there
is
no
entry
into
the
house
or
office
of
the
defendant,
there
is
no
unlawful
search
and
seizure."
and,
again
at
page
23,
he
says,
"the
state
of
the
law
today,
so
far
as
the
supreme
court
decisions
are
concerned,
is
that
the
constitutional
limitations
on
searches
and
seizures
do
not
apply
to
conversations
and
are
confined
to
physical
invasion
and
to
the
seizure
of
physical
objects.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
ban
eavesdropping."
if
the
court
please,
by
reason
of
a
technical
defect
in
the
indictment,
a
superseding
indictment
was
returned.
the
technical
defect
is
not
germane
here
but
a
superseding
indictment
was
returned
in
five
counts
and
the
same
motion
was
made.
this
time,
it
came
on
for
hearing
before
judge
youngdahl
of
the
same
court.
judge
youngdahl
announced
that
he
felt
himself
bound
by
the
rule
of
the
case.
he
did
not
hear
argument
on
the
motion
and
entered
an
order
dismissing
the
motion.
the
case
then
came
on
for
trial
before
judge
jackson
of
the
same
court.
the
motion
was
once
again
renewed
before
the
trial
judge.
he,
feeling
bound
by
the
rule
of
the
case,
denied
the
motion
and
the
case
proceeded.
at
the
trial,
if
the
court
please,
oral
evidence
of
the
conversations
which
were
overheard,
to
which
the
petitioners
were
parties,
the
conversations
which
were
overheard
by
means
of
this
device
were
offered
by
the
prosecutor
and
received
into
evidence
against
the
petitioners.
i
think
it
is
a
fair
statement
of
the
record
to
say
that
these
conversations
constituted
the
bulk
of
the
oral
evidence
given
against
the
defendants
in
the
court
below.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
attached
this
significance
that
the
officers
were
where
they
were
by
permission
but,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
record
is
bare
that
any
permission
or
consent
was
ever
given
to
use
the
party
wall
in
the
way
in
which
it
was
used
by
the
officers.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
with
the
consent
that
they
entered
the
premises
but
there
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
not
sticking
this
into
the
walls.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
type
of
device
that
was
used
in
the
goldman
case,
the
detectaphone,
i
think
so.
and,
i
intend
to
cover
that
rather
thoroughly,
mr.
justice
clark.
i
think
it
is
distinguishable.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
this
was
--
this
was
the
only
device
used,
except
for
the
fact
that
one
of
the
officers
testified
that
he
used
a
water
glass
and,
by
use
of
a
water
tumbler,
was
able
to
overhear
some
conversations.
none
of
those
conversations
were
ever
articulated.
none
of
those
conversations
ever
went
into
evidence.
it
is
significant
that
the
only
conversations
that
were
received
into
evidence
or
offered
by
the
government
were
conversations
which
were
specifically
identified
as
having
been
obtained
by
the
use
of
this
device.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
--
it
was
known
that
they
were
enforcement
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
of
course,
it
also
follows
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
also
follows
that
the
owner
of
the
contiguous
dwelling
house
could
not
consent
to
allow
the
police
officers
to
do
something
which
he
could
not
have
done
himself,
and
i
think
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
which
would
be
an
unauthorized
consent.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
it
went
that
far.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
would
have
been,
sir.
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
it
would've
been
certainly
an
unauthorized
consent
because
he
would
not
have
had
authority
to
misuse
a
party
wall
which
is
designed
to
give
his
house
support
and
to
secure
his
privacy,
auditory
and
visual,
to
invade
the
privacy
of
his
neighbor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there's
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
--
the
record
shows,
mr.
justice
clark,
that
it
was
between
13
and
14
inches
thick.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
now,
at
the
trial,
these
facts
were
developed.
the
officers
had
gone
onto
the
premises
at
410
21st
street.
they
took
this
device
and
they
probed
underneath
the
baseboard
to
find
a
place
where
they
could
insert
it.
they
found
that
they
hit
masonry
or
brick
and
that
they
could
not
insert
it
except
at
one
place,
two-feet
back
from
the
front
wall,
for
a
distance
of
nine
inches.
and
there,
they
could
insert
it
and
went
into
the
wall
until
it
came
into
contact
with
a
surface
which
the
officer
said
gave
meaning
that
it
was
resilient.
now,
the
record
shows
that,
at
this
particular
point,
the
heating
duct
of
petitioner's
premises
ran
through
the
wall.
brick
was
channeled
out
so
that
the
duct
could
run
through
the
wall
and
directly
behind
where
the
officers
were
inserting
this
microphone
was
the
heating
register
for
the
petitioner's
premises.
they
lay
the
tip
of
this
needle
against
the
heating
duct
and
they
converted
the
heating
system
into
a
giant
conductor
of
sound.
they
made
every
register
in
the
premises
at
408
21st
street
a
microphone
so
that
as
the
record
shows,
they
were
able
to
hear
conversations
in
every
part
of
the
dwelling
house
at
408
21st
street.
and,
in
order
to
reach
that
heating
duck
which
they
suspected
they
were
heating,
they
had
to
go
in
for
a
distance
of
seven
and
one
eighths
inches.
an
inspection
of
the
premises,
after
the
fact,
showed
that
sure
enough,
there
was
an
oval
indentation
under
the
baseboard
which
precisely
fitted
this
needle
and,
if
the
needle
were
pressed
through
to
its
point
of
contact,
it
came
into
contact
in
direct
line
with
a
perforation
in
the
heating
duct
of
the
petitioner's
premises.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
shows,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
they
did
not
know
before
they
went
on
those
premises
where
precisely
the
heating
duct
was
located.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
record
shows
that
the
affidavit
on
which
they
--
which
they
used
to
get
the
search
warrant
shows
that
they
had
anonymous
information
or
they
had
information
from
what
they
described
as
a
reliable
source,
otherwise
unidentified,
and
went
on
the
premises
after
finding
that
several
telephones
had
been
leased
to
this
particular
house,
and
then
made
their
observations.
yes,
sir?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
this
was
a
hot-air
heating
system,
yes,
sir.
[laughter]
now,
the
defendants,
of
course,
were
convicted
and
the
case
went
to
the
circuit
court
on
appeal
and,
there,
by
a
2-to-1
decision,
there
was
an
affirmation.
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
call
the
court's
attention,
at
page
269
to
--
of
the
record,
to
judge
washington's
analysis
of
the
facts.
this
is
uncontradicted.
the
majority
does
not
analyze
the
facts
and
this
is
an
uncontradicted
analysis
of
what
the
record
shows
and,
i
should
say,
uncontradicted
form.
the
police
gained
entrance
quite
legally
to
the
row
house
next
to
that
occupied
by
appellants.
they
then
carefully
probe
the
brick
wall
between
the
two
houses
in
search
of
an
advantageous
spot
for
the
insertion
of
their
eavesdropping
device,
a
needle
or
spike
about
12
inches
long
connected
to
an
amplifying
duct.
the
testimony
indicated
that
the
spike,
in
order
to
serve
its
purpose
adequately,
had
to
come
into
contact
with
a
solid
object
capable
of
resonance.
mere
insertion
in
the
plaster
or
brick
of
the
wall
would
be
ineffective.
the
desired
sound
reception
was
obtained
by
inserting
the
spike
about
seven
inches
into
the
party
wall
under
the
baseboard
at
a
point
where
the
wall
contained
the
metal
heating
duct
for
appellants'
house.
the
heating
duct
was
an
excellent
vibrator
and,
furthermore,
ran
into
the
bedroom
as
well
as
the
living
room
of
appellants'
house.
every
inference
in
what
little
direct
evidence
there
was
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
spike
made
contact
with
the
heating
duct,
as
the
police
admittedly
hoped
it
would.
once
the
spike
touched
the
heating
duct,
the
duct
became
in
effect
a
giant
microphone
running
through
the
entire
house
occupied
by
appellants.
the
spike
was
the
conductor
by
which
the
sounds
in
appellants'
house
were
transmitted
to
the
amplifier
in
the
adjoining
house.
conversations
on
both
floors
of
appellants'
house
were
clearly
heard
by
the
police
through
earphones
attached
to
the
amplifier.
motion
was
filed
in
the
circuit
court
for
a
rehearing
en
banc.
this
was
denied
and,
finally
a
petition
was
filed
here
and
granted.
now,
four
times
in
the
last
three
decades,
this
court
has
considered
what
i
think
can
be
described
as
closely
analogous
facts
and
a
closely
analogous
question.
in
1928,
this
court
decided
the
famous
case
of
olmsted
against
the
united
states.
the
court
will
recall
that
in
that
case
the
contention
was
made
by
the
petitioner
that
the
interception
of
his
telephone
conversations
and
the
reception
of
those
conversations
in
evidence
by
the
trial
judge
violated
his
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
rejected
that
contention
by
a
vote
of
5-to-4.
mr.
justice
holmes,
mr.
justice
brandeis,
mr.
justice
butler
and
stone
dissented.
in
almost
with
unerring
prophecy,
three
decades
ago,
mr.
justice
brandeis
foresaw
the
factual
situation
in
the
case
at
bar.
when
he
said
time
works
changes,
it
brings
into
existence
new
conditions
and
purposes.subtler
and
more
far-reaching
means
of
invading
privacy
have
become
available
to
the
government.
discovery
and
invention
had
made
it
possible
for
the
government,
by
means
far
more
effective
than
stretching
upon
their
act
to
obtain
disclosure
in
court
of
what
is
whispered
in
the
closet.
in
the
application
of
a
constitution,
our
contemplation
cannot
be
only
of
what
has
been
but
of
what
may
be.
"ways
may
someday
be
developed,"
says
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
opinion,
"by
which
the
government
will
be
enabled
to
expose
to
a
jury
the
most
intimate
occurrences
of
the
home."
14
years
went
by
and
there
came
before
this
court
the
goldman
case
in
1942,
decided
shortly
after
world
war
ii
began.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
claimed
and
complained
that
a
detectaphone
had
been
planted
against
the
wall
of
a
contiguous
office
and
that
agents
of
the
federal
government
had
listened
to
his
conversations
in
the
next
office
and
that
this
evidence
had
been
offered
against
him
and
that
this
was
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
this
case
was
distinguishable
from
the
olmsted
case
because
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
foresee
that
such
an
intrusion
into
his
privacy
could
take
place
because
he
was
not
projecting
his
voice
over
the
telephone
beyond
his
office
but
having
a
private
conversation
with
a
man
in
a
room.
the
court,
by
a
vote
of
5-to-3,
rejected
his
contention
with
mr.
justice
murphy
dissenting
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
joined
with
mr.
justice
stone
articulating
the
fact
that
if
the
majority
of
the
court
had
seen
fit
to
overrule
olmsted,
they
would
go
along
but,
since
the
court
did
not,
olmsted
was
controlling.
now,
the
philosophical
rational
behind
these
cases,
i
think,
is
fair
to
say
was
that
the
court
felt
that
the
penumbra
of
the
fourth
amendment
did
not
cover
conversations.
it
did
not
cover
things
other
than
material,
physical,
tangible
entities.
but
in
that
case,
there
was
articulated
in
the
dissent
with,
what
i
think
was
irrefutable
logic
by
mr.
justice
murphy,
these
sentiments.
it's
a
strange
doctrine
that
keeps
inviolate
the
most
mundane
observations
entrusted
to
the
permanence
of
paper
but
allows
the
revelations
of
thoughts
uttered
within
the
sanctity
of
private
quarters
thoughts,
perhaps
too
intimate
to
be
set
down
even
in
a
secret
diary,
or,
indeed,
utterances
about
which
the
common
law
drew
the
cloak
of
privilege
the
most
confidential
relations
between
husband
and
wife,
client-lawyer,
patient-physician,
penitent
and
spiritual
adviser
nor
can
i
see
any
rational
basis
for
denying
to
the
modern
means
of
communication
the
same
protection
that
is
extended
by
the
amendment
to
seal
letters
in
the
mails.
again,
it
was
10
years
before
a
comparable
situation
came
to
the
court.
in
the
on
lee
case,
decided
in
1952,
this
court
had
to
consider
whether
a
violation
of
petitioners'
fourth
amendment
rights
took
place
when
an
informer
went
on
to
petitioners'
business
premises,
engaged
him
in
a
conversation
incriminatory
in
nature,
all
the
while
having
concealed
on
his
person
a
radio
transmitter
which
was
carrying
this
conversation
to
a
federal
agent
who
had
secreted
himself
beyond
petitioners'
premises.
the
court,
by
a
vote
of
5-to-4,
rejected
petitioners'
contentions.
the
place
was
a
public
place
to
which
the
informer
was
invited
and
one
of
the
parties
in
that
instance
had
consented
to
the
transmission
of
the
conversation.
but,
it
is
very
significant
that
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
united
states
by
the
solicitor
general,
he
sought
even
at
that
early
stage,
almost
a
decade
ago,
to
distinguish
that
case
from
a
case
such
as
the
one
that
is
presently
before
the
court
when
he
said,
in
his
brief,
the
various
situations
envisaged
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
where
mechanical
contrivances
are
used
to
publicize
conversations
within
a
private
home
are
unrelated
to
the
instant
case.
as
has
been
observed
here,
a
private
home
is
not
here
involved.
the
conversation
transpired
in
a
place
to
which
the
public
was
invited.
in
any
event,
science
should
in
the
future,
perfect
instruments
which
seriously
invade
truly
private
conversations,
the
validity
of
such
developments
may
be
considered
as
they
appeared.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
theory
here,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
to
give
a
demonstration,
i
think,
of
the
foresight
of
the
solicitor
general
in
envisaging
a
situation
that
might
come
before
this
court,
such
as
the
one
in
the
case
at
bar,
and
to
demonstrate
that
he
foresaw
that
that
was
clearly
distinguishable
from
the
case
which
he
was
then
arguing.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
sure
that
the
court
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
the
present
solicitor
general.
i
did
not
quote
him
critically.
i
quoted
it
as
an
intelligent
observation
of
what
might
one
day
be
before
this
court.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
did
not
intend
to
do
it
with
a
great
deal
of
a
(inaudible)
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
in
the
following
case,
two
years
later,
where
this
same
factual
situation
was
treated
by
the
court,
irvine
against
the
state
of
california.
we
had
a
flagrant
situation.
a
situation
where
officers
of
the
state
of
california
had
gained
access
to
the
petitioners'
dwelling
house
by
use
of
a
skeleton
key,
board
a
hole
in
his
roof,
listened
to
conversations
which
took
place
within
his
house
and
which
were
transmitted
to
a
garage
where
the
agents
of
the
state
of
california
had
secreted
themselves.
this
court
found
that
this
conduct
was
violative
of
the
petitioners'
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
this
was
articulated
in
a
majority
opinion
and
it
was
articulated
in
the
dissents,
but
the
majority
of
this
court
was
unwilling
to
impose
upon
the
state
of
california
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
on
evidence
illegally
obtained.
but,
the
case
is
significant
here
because
it's
demonstrative
of
the
fact
that,
contrary
to
the
finding
of
the
lower
court
in
this
instance,
conversations
are
within
the
comprehension
and
purview
of
the
fourth
amendment
protections,
and
i
think
that
it's
a
fair
statement
to
say
that
this
court
was
far
more
concerned
with
the
calculated,
long,
invasion
of
the
privacy
of
the
petitioner
in
that
case
than
they
were
over
the
momentary
trespass
upon
his
physical
premises.
now,
what
is
the
government
say
about
all
this?
the
government
doesn't
contend,
as
i
understand
their
position,
that
private
conversations
are
not
within
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government,
rather,
says,
"there's
no
trespass
in
this
case."
that's
the
thrust
of
their
position.
to
that,
we
say
there
is
a
trespass
in
this
case,
number
one,
but,
number
two,
that
it
is
no
longer
necessary
that
there'd
be
an
old
common
law
trespass
before
there
is
a
violation
of
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment.
on
trespass,
the
record
shows,
number
one,
that
this
device
was
inserted
into
a
party
wall
against
the
heating
duct
designed
to
service
petitioners'
premises
and
petitioners'
premises
alone.
the
record
shows
that
it
was
inserted
seven
and
an
eighths
inches
before
it
came
into
contract
--
contact
with
the
back
of
the
register
of
the
petitioners'
dwelling
house.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
record
shows
that
it
was
between
13
and
14
inches,
and
that's
the
best
that
any
witness
was
able
to
do
for
us.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no
one
said
it
was
beyond
14.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
be
an
eighth
of
an
inch
more
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
more
than
half.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
was
a
trespass
far
and
excess
of
one-eighth
of
an
inch.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
like
to
measure
it
in
terms
of
eighth
of
inches
in
this
instance.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
you
adopt
the
government's
theory
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
that
this
wall
was
owned
as
a
tenancy
by
severalty
and
that
each
owned
one-half
and
could
do
whatever
he
chose
with
his
one-half,
including
remove
the
bricks,
i
suppose
that
it
was
a
trespass
only
in
one-eighth
of
an
inch,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
would
be
an
eighth
of
an
inch
on
that
theory,
but
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
was
a
de
minimis,
i
think,
when
it
came
into
contact
with
the
heating
register
of
the
petitioners'
dwelling
house
and
converted
the
heating
system
into
a
sound
conductor
system,
mr.
justice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
that
was
found
on
inspection
some
time
after
the
facts
that
were
developed
in
this
case,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
thrust
of
your
question.
the
heating
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
heating
duct
was
inside
the
wall.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
--
the
bricks
were
channeled
out
so
that
the
duct
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
did
not
because
it
necess
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
sir,
because
of
a
seven
and
eighth
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
think
that
it's
entirely
correct
to
say
that
it
shows
as
trespass
when
they
came
into
contact
with
the
heating
duct,
which
were
peculiarly
designed
for
408
21st
street,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
my
theory
is
this,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
that
a
party
wall
is
no
more
or
less
than
a
joint
investment
by
contiguous
owners
in
support
and
privacy
and
that
if
the
party
wall
is
abused
or
if
its
purpose
is
aborted
by
either
party,
either
by
invading
into
the
support
or
invading
into
the
privacy
of
his
neighbor,
then
there
is
a
trespass.
all
walls
have,
as
i
understand
it,
three
functions.
one
is
for
support,
one
is
for
security
against
intrusion
by
animals
and
elements
and
strangers,
and
the
third
is
for
privacy,
auditory
and
visual
privacy.
now,
a
party
wall
has,
for
its
purpose,
support
and
auditory
and
visual
privacy.
and,
when
one
owner
uses
the
party
wall
to
invade
the
privacy
of
his
contiguous
owner
by
inserting
a
device
of
this
kind,
i
say
there
is
a
trespass
because
if
the
government's
contention
is
true,
if
the
government's
contention
is
true,
it
means
that
the
fourth
amendment
gives
no
protection
--
auditory
protection
to
persons
who
live
in
row
houses,
tenement
houses,
apartment
houses,
or
rooming
houses.
the
fourth
amendment
would
then
protect
only
those
persons
who
lived
in
private
dwelling
houses,
the
walls
of
which
were
self-sustaining
and
wholly
apart
from
other
walls.
it
would
mean
that
in
multi-family
dwelling
units,
in
order
to
be
absolutely
certain
that
one
was
having
a
private
conversation,
it
would
be
necessary
to
adjourn
to
a
room
insulated
in
tinfoil,
a
windowless,
heatless
room
and
hold
conversations
where
a
device
of
this
kind
could
not
penetrate.
i
don't
think
that
the
fourth
amendment
can
be
construed
to
extend
its
protection
solely
to
those
persons
who
live
only
in
self-standing,
individual,
private
dwelling
houses
which
do
not
have
any
party
walls.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
does
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
does
challenge
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
constitutional
rights
should
be
contingent
upon
the
preservation
of
the
scientific
status
quo.
i
don't
believe
that.
and,
in
our
brief,
we
show
that,
in
the
past
decade,
and
we
show
it
through
illusion
to
the
senate
subcommittee
on
constitutional
rights
hearings
and
their
reports
to
the
senate,
of
which
i
believe
this
court
can
take
judicial
notice,
that
today,
parabolic
microphones
have
been
developed
which
are
able
to
extricate
sound
from
a
room
50
yards
away.
shotgun
microphones
can
extricate
sound
from
a
room
50
yards
away.
sonic
beams
can
flood
a
room
today
100
yards
away
and
the
conversations
therein
contained
can
be
extricated,
and
that
the
only
possibility
of
insulating
one's
self
from
that
kind
of
an
invasion
is
to
use
some
form
of
aluminum
that
will
resist
this
kind
of
wave
and
use
a
windowless,
heatless
room,
or
a
window
which
is
made
up
of
conducting
glass.
now,
i
believe
that,
as
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
said,
constitutions,
more
than
any
other
form
of
human
institution,
should
approach
immortality
and
that,
in
their
application,
the
contemplation
should
be
not
what
was
but
what
may
be.
and
i
think
that
today,
with
the
advances
of
science,
that
the
only
way
in
which
the
fourth
amendment
can
guarantee
the
protection
and
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
which
it
was
designed
to
guarantee,
is
to
eliminate
from
the
law,
the
old
common
law
concept
of
tort
trespasses
because,
otherwise,
it
becomes
a
mere
nugatory
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
barren
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir,
and
that's
what
i
said
at
the
outset,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
believe
there
was
a
trespass
here,
but
i
would
hope
that
when
this
court
decides
the
case
that
it
would
find
the
existence
of
a
trespass
is
not
the
turning
factor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
that
is
an
overstatement
of
my
position.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
say
that
it
--
i
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment
should
guaran
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
that
the
fourth
amendment,
in
the
frame
of
reference
scientifically
in
which
we
are
now
treating
it
here
today,
if
it
is
to
give
what
it
was
intended
to
give,
must
protect
one
in
his
private
family
dwelling
house
from
the
kind
of
invasion
that
can,
today,
be
affected
by
the
use
of
electronic
devices
in
lifting
the
sound
from
the
room
and
transmitting
it
to
places
where
the
con
--
the
persons
engaged
in
the
conversation
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
is
being
transmitted.
yes,
i
believe
that,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
hope
the
court
will
do
that
but
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
is
necessary
to
do
that
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
it
is
sir.
but
it
is
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
have
to
say
to
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
not
necessary
to
overrule
--
overrule
olmsted
to
reverse
this
case.
i
would
hope
that,
in
reversing
this
case,
it
would
overrule
olmsted
but
this
is
distinguishable
because,
here,
there
is
a
trespass
even
within
the
comprehension
of
goldman
and
olmsted.
in
the
--
in
the
olmsted
case,
they
had
physical
contact
with
a
wire,
but
the
wire
was
much
removed
from
the
premises
occupied
by
olmsted.
it
was
a
--
a
telephone
wire
in
the
basement
of
a
large
apartment
house,
not
in
his
unit.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
if
science
should
devise
a
means
but
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
that's
right.
if
--
if
a
device
were
such
as
a
--
did
for
auditory
--
for
visual
--
the
visual
sense,
what
this
device
did
for
the
auditory
sense,
penetrated
a
wall
like
an
x-ray
machine,
i
would
say
it
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
if
it
was
simply
a
telescope,
by
which
one
looked
across
a
street
and
looked
into
a
window
which
the
occupant
could
reasonably
foresee,
might
be
used
in
this
way
because
he
didn't
pull
the
shade,
then
i
would
have
--
have
trouble
with
that
because
i
think
that
it's
--
where
a
--
a
telescope
is
used
and
someone
wants
to
protect
and
insulate
himself
from
being
seen,
he
could
pull
the
shade,
but
there's
no
way
to
insulate
one's
self
from
this
device
except
to
go
through
the
--
the
process
which
i
outlined
a
few
moments
ago
for
the
court,
which
i
think
is
a
wholly
unreasonable
thing
to
expect
a
citizen
to
do
in
order
to
converse
privately
in
his
dwelling
house
today.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
certainly
think
that
is
one
factor
which
goes
into
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
evaluation
of
this
question.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
don't
think
that
anyone,
no
matter
how
humble
his
dwelling
house,
cannot
get
privacy
from
visual
invasion
if
he
--
if
he
wants
to
do
it,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
factor.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
think
that
i
could
insulate
myself
from
your
television
--
from
your
telescope
regardless
of
what
kind
of
a
tenement
i
lived
in.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
it
can
penetrate
a
wall,
then
i
say
that
it's
a
violation
because
i
cannot,
within
reason,
protect
my
privacy
as
against
it.
this
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
not
this
case,
no,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
he
found
--
he
found
two
things.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
found
two
things.
he
found,
on
the
one
hand,
that
there
was
an
insertion
from
six
to
eight
inches
but
he
said
that,
de
minimis
non
curat
lex,
that
he
was
not
going
to
hang
constitutional
rights
or
liberties
on
a
fraction
of
an
inch
and
that
he
felt
constrained
to
follow
olmsted
and
goldman
which
he
interpreted
as
holding
as
not
protecting
conversations
within
a
dwelling
house
but
only
protecting
touchable,
tangible,
material,
physical
things.
this
is
what
i
read
judge
holtzoff
is
saying.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
have
trouble
with
the
word
"snooping,"
mr.
justice
harlan.
if
you
mean
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
snooping
by
this
device.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
would
say
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
would
say
it
didn't
--
wouldn't
make
any
difference
what
the
fact
was
because
i
would
think
that
if
federal
officers
are
going
to
use
this
type
of
device
to
extricate
sound
from
private
dwelling
houses,
it
certainly
ought
to
be,
if
this
were
possible,
with
the
support
of
a
warrant
issued
by
a
court,
but
i
gravely
doubt
whether
a
warrant
would
ever
issue
for
this
kind
of
thing
because,
obviously,
this
is
an
evidentiary
search
and
warrants,
as
i
understand
them,
are
not
issued
for
evidentiary
searches.
they're
only
issued
for
getting
contraband
or
getting
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
fruits
of
crime
or
instruments
of
crime,
so
that,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
this
kind
of
device
would
ever
be
authorized
by
a
search
warrant.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and,
i
certainly
think
it
should
not
be
used
without
a
search
warrant
if
a
search
warrant
would
never
lie
for
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
believe
that
that
is
an
entirely
illegal
and
invalid
procedure.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it's
invalid
and
illegal
in
new
york.
i
think
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
this
feel
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
that
new
york
is
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
is
a
--
new
york
law
enforcement
officers
violate
the
federal
statute
every
time
they
do
that,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i'm
sorry?
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
then,
i
suppose
the
question
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
question
would
then
be
whether
this
court
wanted
to
extend
the
traditional
concept
of
the
purpose
for
which
warrants
of
search
or
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
in
all
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence.
never
have
i
known
a
court
which
authorized
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
of
search
solely
for
the
securing
of
evidentiary
material.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right,
but
the
congress
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
authorize
this
form
of
law
enforcement
insofar
as
i
know
the
use
of
electronic
eavesdropping
for
purposes
of
hearing
private
conversations
in
dwelling
houses.
now,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
my
argument
is
that
it
falls
by
virtue
of
the
fourth
amendment,
by
virtue
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
that,
in
any
event,
this
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
over
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
lower
courts,
ought
to
outlaw
the
reception
of
this
kind
of
evidence.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
make
this
distinction
for
this
reason,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
as
i
understand,
the
fourth
amendment
guaranteed
the
right
of
the
people
to
be
secure
in
their
homes
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
but
a
necessary
qualification
of
that
right
was
that
warrants
might
issue
on
probable
cause
to
conduct
a
reasonable
search
and
seizure.
but
historically,
as
i
understand
the
origin
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
decisions
under
it,
warrants
of
search
issued
in
common
law
solely
for
contraband,
fruits
of
crime,
and
instruments
of
crime.
and,
i
think
that
when
the
founding
fathers
wrote
the
fourth
amendment
into
the
american
bill
of
rights,
it
was
in
this
frame
of
reference
and
they
never
intended
that
officers
of
the
law
should
be
given
ingress
into
the
home
of
private
citizens
so
that
they
could
fair
about
in
a
search
for
evidence
of
crime.
i
don't
believe
that,
and
so
i
say
that
if
the
congress
should
pass
such
an
act
authorizing
warrants
to
issue
or
this
kind
of
a
search,
that
there
would
be
a
grave
constitutional
question
which
would
be
presented
to
this
court,
notwithstanding
the
existence
of
the
statute.
this
is
my
belief,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it's
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it's
just
the
same
as
the
fellow
who
lived
in
410
21st
street.
he
couldn't
authorize
going
into
that
wall
because
he
couldn't
have
done
it
himself.
i
feel
that
the
two
questions
are
analogous.
i
--
i
say
--
and
my
time
is
running,
but
i
say
to
the
court
that
it's
my
belief
that,
traditionally,
in
anglo-saxon
jurisprudence,
we
have
always
held
the
axiom
that
a
man's
house
is
his
castled.
it
was
articulated,
i
suppose,
most
eloquently
by
mr.
william
pitt
as
the
earl
of
chatham.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
when
he
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
intend
to.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
i
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
as
your
honor
is
very
well
familiar
with,
in
the
mcnabb
case,
this
court
decided
that,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
had
not
been
a
constitutional
violation
of
mcnabb's
rights
by
the
illegal
detention
and
by
the
reception
in
evidence
of
what
otherwise
was
a
wholly
voluntary
confession
that
this
court
felt,
in
the
exercise
of
its
powers
over
the
administration
of
justice
over
the
lower
courts,
that
it
should
exclude
this
kind
of
evidence.
i
suppose,
and
i
don't
know,
that
the
philosophical
rationale
behind
this
was
that
this
court
has
forever
found
upon
the
tenant
that
the
end
justifies
the
means
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
and
when
a
confession
was
obtained
as
the
result
of
an
illicit
means,
namely,
the
illicit
detention
of
petitioner
mcnabb,
this
court
was
unwilling
to
allow
the
government
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
that
illicit
act
and,
therefore,
invoke
the
federal
exclusionary
rule
to
strike
it
down
and
i
feel
that
the
case
at
bar
is
an
appropriate
case
for
the
invocation
of
that
rule.
for
these
reasons,
i
respectfully
request
that
the
court
reverse
the
judgment
in
the
case
at
bar
for
the
reasons
which
i
have
outlined
during
my
argument
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
or
alternatively,
the
fifth
or
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
that
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
should
be
excluded
from
a
federal
courtroom
in
this
land.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
were
some
questions
asked
of
counsel
for
the
government
that
i
think
should
be
cleared
up
by
record
references.
the
suggestion
was
made
to
the
court
that
it
was
wholly
a
defense
theory
that
the
agents
of
the
government
were
hitting
the
duct
of
the
premises
at
408
21st
street.
the
record
doesn't
bear
this
out
because,
at
page
144
of
the
record
and
145,
it's
shown
that
officer
stone
said,
and
i
cite
the
bottom
of
page
144
that,
in
response
to
a
question,
"now,
when
you
penetrated
with
your
mic,
you
penetrated
at
the
point
of
the
heat
duct,
did
you
not?"
"possibly,
yes,
sir."
then,
over
at
145,
"and
you
thought
you
were
going
in
at
a
point
where
the
duct
was,
did
you
not?"
answer,
"i
had
an
idea
that
might
be
the
case.
yes,
sir,
and
the
duct
at
408
filled
the
part
of
what
otherwise
would
have
been
a
party
wall,
did
it
not?"
"that's
correct.
it
was
inserted
into
the
wall."
and
that
particular
duct
was
a
duct
that
serviced
408
exclusively,
did
it
not?"
and,
he
answered,
"that's
correct."
now,
at
page
158,
if
the
court
please,
a
reading
of
the
colloquy
at
page
158
where
the
same
witness
is
under
examination,
i
cannot
but
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
he
believed,
although
it
was
difficult
to
get
him
to
admit
that
he
was
penetrating
at
a
point
where
he
was
touching
the
duct.
he
says,
at
the
bottom
of
page
58,
after
several
questions
at
158,
"i
believe
i
did
state
that
i
thought
of
the
possibility
that
the
mic
was
contacting
the
duct
on
the
other
side."
and,
at
page
160,
the
question
is
put,
"now,
you
testified,"
and
i'm
reading
from
two-thirds
of
the
way
down,
"in
answer
to
a
question
by
mr.
williams,
you
knew
you
didn't
think
you
were
hitting
brick
when
you
came
into
this
object,
isn't
that
correct?"
answer,
"it
didn't
feel
like
a
brick
wall,
no,
sir."
question,
"what
did
it
feel
like
to
the
best
of
your
memory?"
"well,
there
was
a
sleight,
slight
bit
of
give,
a
slight
before
it
stopped."
the
record
is
absolutely
uncontradicted,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
only
place
where
this
needled
could
penetrate
is
was
for
a
nine-inch
stretch
under
the
baseboard
of
that
wall,
precisely
in
front
of
the
heating
duct.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
the
counsel
for
the
government
if
there
was
anything
in
the
record
to
show
how
far
this
needle
had
to
be
inserted
before
it
touched
the
duct.
the
rec
--
the
record
is
entirely
clear
on
this,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
215
of
the
record.
page
215,
question,
and
i'm
reading
from
about
one-fourth
of
the
way
down,
"will
you
tell
his
honor
and
the
jurors
the
measurements
that
you
found
when
you
measured
that
distance
including
the
shoe
molding,
the
baseboard,
and
then
the
plain
airspace."
we
found
we
had
to
go
in
seven
and
a
half
inches
--
seven
and
an
eighth
inches
to
touch
that
duct
--
the
back
of
that
duct."
seven
and
an
eighth
inches
counting
what
sir,
counting
the
shoe
mold
and
the
baseboard,
yes,
sir."
at
220,
that
testimony
is
repeated.
halfway
down,
"now,
i
believe
you
testified
there
came
a
time
when
you
went
to
410
21st
street
and
you
insul
--
inserted
a
coat
hanger
or
a
spike.
you
had
to
put
this
object
seven
and
a
half
inches
from
the
lip
of
the
toe
molding
to
touch
what
you
referred
to
as
the
back
of
the
duct,
is
that
correct?"
answer,
"i
believe
i
said
seven
and
an
eighth
inches,
sir."
"seven
and
an
eighth?"
"yes,
sir."
again,
at
page
234
and
235,
if
the
court
please,
that
testimony
is
repeated.
if
you
will
look
at
the
very
top
sentence
at
the
page
235,
you
will
see
that
it
was
seven
and
an
eighth
inches
that
this
spike
had
to
penetrate
in
order
to
touch
the
duct.
again,
the
record
speaks
contrary
to
what
counsel
for
the
government
says
when
he
says
that
it's
silent
with
respect
to
whether
this
had
to
come
in
contact
with
the
surface
in
order
to
be
effective
because,
at
page
200
--
i'm
sorry,
at
page
156,
it's
entirely
clear
from
the
record
that
this
had
to
touch
something.
from
the
testimony
of
the
government's
own
witnesses,
two-thirds
of
the
way
down,
question,
"well,
will
you
explain
it
to
me
again
then,
please,
because
i
didn't
understand?"
answer,
"i
said
from
my
knowledge
of
this
instrument,
it
should
be
in
contact,
that
the
point
should
be
in
contact
with
some
surface
which
would
act
as
a
sounding
board
to
pick
up
the
sound
waves
and
transmit
the
sound
waves
to
the
needle.
the
needle
does
not
have
to
be
embedded
into
that
object
so
long
as
there
is
a
contact."
also,
the
record
is
very
clear,
if
the
court
please,
that
the
fact
is
they
could
hear
conversations
from
all
over
the
house
at
408
21st
street,
petitioner's
dwelling
house."
page
97
of
the
record
and,
again,
it's
the
government's
own
witnesses,
at
the
very
bottom,
"now,
where
did
mr.
menendez
and
mr.
martin
conversed?"
answer,
"i
couldn't

i
could
not
tell
you
exactly
where
they
conversed
because
i
was

but,
it
seems
to
me,
they
were
conversing
in
the
room
on
the
first
floor,
on
the
first
floor
of
the
building,
i
would
say
and,
mind
you,
they
were
on
the

when
they
conducted
their
electronic
surveillance.

edward
bennett
williams
at
the
very
bottom,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
page
97.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
then,
again,
at
page
98,
question,
"is
it
your
testimony
that
this
microphone
on
the
second
floor
picked
up
conversations
on
the
first
floor?"
answer,
"that
is
correct.
i
would
say
that."
again,
at
page
99,
if
the
court
please,
"now,
on
the
occasion
that
you
were
there
with
detective
stone
when
you
inserted
the
spike
microphone
and
mr.
menendez
was
present
in
the
other
house
with
mr.
martin,
you
were
in
this
front
bedroom,
were
you
not?"
"that
is
correct.
i
was
in
the
front
bedroom.
that
was
on
the
second
floor."
again,
if
the
court
please,
at
page
100,
question,
"did
you
go
downstairs
when
you
found
that
mr.
menendez
and
mr.
martin
were
conversing
downstairs?
did
you
go
downstairs
and
insert
your
microphone?"
answer,
"no,
sir.
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
downstairs
to
insert
the
microphone."
so,
i
say
that
it's
accurate
and
there
are
other
references
here.
again,
at
page
101
and
104,
that
