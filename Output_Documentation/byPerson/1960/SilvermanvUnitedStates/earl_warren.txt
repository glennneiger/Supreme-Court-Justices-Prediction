earl
warren
mr.
williams,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
was
science
fiction
just
a
few
years
ago,
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
like
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
olmsted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
science
--
science
fiction
in
my
day,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
it
touch
in
the
--
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
something
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
something
that
was
resonant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
government's
testimonies
say
it
did
not
touch
the
--
the
heating
duct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
measure
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you,
what
--
what
did
that
strike
in
--
according
to
your
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
they
drilled
right
into
the
wall
and
inserted
at
the
--
the
distance
that
you
say
the
government
testimony
showed,
would
--
would
there
be
any
--
any
effectiveness
to
the
instrument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what's
the
purpose
of
the
spike
if
it
isn't
to
penetrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
the
test
--
testimony
offered
by
the
government
to
the
effect
that
only
the
conversation
in
one
room
could
be
heard
through
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
--
they
--
do
they
contend
that
it
could
not
be
heard
in
all
the
rooms
of
the
house?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
i've
been
wondering
if
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
show
that
this
spike
hit
--
hit
the
heating
apparatus
or
nothing
in
the
evidence
to
show
that
they
could
hear
through
it,
but
many
part
of
the
building.
where
did
--
where
did
judge
washington
get
his
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
his
information
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
the
effect
that
this
created
or
established
a
giant
microphone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
say
there
was
no
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
government
contrary
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
have
it
touched
if
he
didn't
touch
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
what
does
the
evidence
show
as
to
how
far
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
insert
that
point,
that
spike,
in
order
to
reach
the
heating
system?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
i'm
an
--
i
don't
get
that.
i
don't
--
if
those
distances,
if
it's
four
and
three
quarters
inches,
four
and
three
quarters
inches
from
where?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
this
case
should
turn
on
whether
they
were
in
there
five
and
three
quarter
inches
or
six
and
three
quarter
inches?
would
you
want
the
--
would
you
want
the
conviction
of
this
man
to
stand
on
which
of
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
since
there
were
accurate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
would
you
be
willing
to
rest
that
on
the
court's
finding
that
they
went
in
there
somewhere
between
six
and
eight
inches?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
the
matter
--
isn't
that
the
basis
on
which
he
made
this
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
didn't
take
the
--
he
didn't
take
the
finding
of
judge
holtzoff
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
evidence
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
were
no
instructions
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
mr.
williams?
do
you
make
any
distinction
so
far
as
this
right
that
you're
talking
about
now
in
the
police
officers
between
the
situation
where
they're
just
going
around
generally
and
listening
into
people's
homes
or
the
situation
where
--
on
the
other
hand,
where
they
suspect
that
maybe
there's
something
going
on
illegally
in
there?
do
you
make
any
distinction
or
do
you
say
that
all
of
them
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
proper.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
had
--
suppose
these
had
just
been
some
strangers
there
and
the
police
said,
"well,
we
don't
know
who
these
people
are
and
they
may
be
involved
in
--
in
some
illegal
activity,
so
we'll
just
go
and
put
this
instrument
on
their
home
and
did
this
as
a
--
"
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be
harder
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
what
do
you
think
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
would
sustain
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
we
have
to
protect
the
public
against
that
kind
of
so-called
snooping,
and
--
then
we'll
have
to
get
rid
of
goldman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
you
go
into
that
point,
my
--
my
question
was
in
the
context
of
a
constitutional
violation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
was
a
constitutional
violation,
how
would
this
court
stop
it
if
you
went
as
far
as
to
say
that
it
was
perfectly
alright
for
a
police
officer
to
--
to
go
to
a
strange
home
when
he
didn't
know
anything
about?
and,
for
the
purpose
of
inquiring
and
finding
out
what
--
what
they
were
doing
in
there
was
to
use
this
instrument.
well,
i
wasn't
talking
about
whether
congress
could
do
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
whether
they
should
do
it,
as
talking
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren

williams.

justice

--
where
is
that
on
the

justice
