does
the
record
show
what
information,
if
any,
of
these
officers
had
before
they
got
permission
to
go
into
408?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
know.
i
meant,
today,
with
any
evidence
to
indicate
that
they
had
suspicion
a
gambling
operation
was
being
conducted
next
to
the
farm
--
next
to
the
house.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
that
view,
the
sticking
of
this
gadget
into
the
wall
becomes
immaterial
in
that
view.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
--
well,
carried
to
the
full
extreme,
is
this
an
overstatement
of
your
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
prohibits
the
use
of
any
electronics
device
in
investigatory
rights?
is
that
an
overstatement
of
your
position?
justice

well
--

an
electronic
device
that
can
protrude
itself
by
sound
effect
or
any
other
method
into
the
inside
of
a
person's
house.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
one
aspect
of
your
argument
is
for
us
to
overrule
olmsted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
it
is
necessary
in
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
your
broad
approach
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
your
broad
argument,
that
is
a
constant,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
necessary
to
overrule
olmsted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
the
premise
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
taking
your
theory
for
a
moment
in
its
broadest
application,
would
you
draw
any
distinction
between
a
case
where
the
agents
were
just
interested
in
snooping
generally
to
see
what
they
can
pick
up
and
a
case
where
they
directed
their
snooping
to
an
activity
where,
independently
of
the
snooping,
they
had
reason
to
believe
something
crooked
was
going
on?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i

harlan
i
mean,

harlan
you
have
a

justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
how
about
procedure,
like
you
have
in
new
york
telephone
wires
where
you
go
to
a
judge
and
get
permission
to
tap
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
in
new
york.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
different

justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
different
question.
