justice
potter
stewart
was
the
affidavit
which
supporting
the
search
warrant,
does
that
affidavit
appear
in
the
record
here?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams,
coming
back
to
this
case
and
to
the
--
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
physical
common
law
trespass,
you
told
us
that
the
owners
show
that
the
insertion
of
this
spike
was
seven
and
an
eighth
inches
and
by
--
i
mean
in
the
testimony,
there
was,
therefore,
at
least
a
trespass
of
an
eighth
of
an
inch.
but,
now,
the
fact
is,
isn't
it,
that
the
evidence
is
in
controversy
on
that
issue
and
isn't
there
a
finding
by
judge
holtzoff
that
there
was
no
trespass,
was
no
physical
trespass?
justice
potter
stewart
why
don't
you
read
it
that
way?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
miss
another
day
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
--
getting
away
for
a
moment
from
the
facts
of
the
--
of
the
trespass,
how
about
the
law
of
the
district
of
columbia
as
to
party
walls?
is
it
clear
as
to
who
owns
what
in
a
party
wall?
justice
potter
stewart
for
support.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
have
an
undivided
ownership
in
the
wall
up
to
the
midpoint.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
four
and
ninth-sixteenth
from
the
defendants'
wall,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart

--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
davis,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
my
--
my
question
is
very
similar
to
the
one
that
the
chief
justice
just
asked
you
and
it
may
be
the
same
question,
although
i'm
not
sure.
the
government
used
what
was
overheard
by
this
device
in
this
case
in
two
different
ways,
as
i
understand
it.
it
was
used,
first,
in
the
affidavits
which
supported
the
search
warrant.
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
these
officers
who
overheard
the
conversations
swore
to
that
fact
and
it
was
on
that
basis
or
partially
on
that
basis
that
the
search
warrants
were
issued.
and
then,
in
quite
a
different
way
or
a
second
way,
a
distinct
way,
what
was
overheard
was
testified
to
at
the
criminal
trial
of
these
defendants
and
was
admitted
into
evidence.
now,
do
you
distinguish
between
those
two
uses
at
all?
might
it
be
--
did
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
recognize
that
it
might
be
possible
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
the
first
use
might
be
proper
and
the
second
one
might
be
improper?
justice
potter
stewart
reverse
--
justice
potter
stewart
reverse
for
a
new
trial
but
what
was
found,
if
the
first
use
was
proper
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what
was
found
as
a
result
of
the
search
warrant
would
be
admissible,
wouldn't
it?
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
or
it
might
be?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
for
example,
hearsay
can
support
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
an
affidavit
for
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
hearsay
is
not
admissible
in
the
--
in
the
trial
of
a
case.
