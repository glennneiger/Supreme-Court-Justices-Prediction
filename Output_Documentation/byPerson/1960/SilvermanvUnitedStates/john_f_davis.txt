mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
not
attempt
to
defend
as
proper
police
action
the
use
of
such
science
fiction
devices
as
mr.
williams
would
describe.
i
do
not
know
whether
it's
possible
for
police
officers
to
send,
race
into
houses,
and
to
find
out
what
is
going
on
as
they
drive
down
the
streets.
but
whether
it
is
possible
or
not,
that
is
not
the
case
before
us
and
i
think
we
have
enough
with
this
--
with
this
device
which
we
have.
this
--
this
is
actually
a
rather
simple
hearing
aid.
basically,
it
cons
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
call
it
a
hearing
aid.
[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i'll
come
back
to
that
in
a
minute.
it
consists
of
a
microphone,
which
is
this
gadget
here,
with
a
sharp
spike
attached
to
it
to
conduct
sounds.
this
is
itself
not
electric.
it's
mechanical
that
conduct
sound
waves
that
are
picked
up
by
the
spike
to
the
microphone.
this
device
here
has
got
a
battery
in
it
which
is
still
live.
i
tested
it.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
these
are
switches.
there's
an
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
do
not
know
who
makes
it.
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
are
obtainable
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
so.
there
are,
however
--
they
are
--
there
are
other
copies
exactly
like
this.
i
see
a
device
exactly
like
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
so,
i
think
it's
been
assembled
as
a
unit
by
somebody.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
defending
the
use
that
it
is
making.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
this
has
no
use
except
as
a
device
to
--
to
snoop
with.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
parts
may
have,
but
not
this
device
as
put
together.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
think
--
you
might
try
it,
your
honor,
perhaps
to
hear
a
baby
moving
in
the
next
room
or
something
like
that.
it
could
be
used--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
could
be
used
for
that.
[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
defending
it,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
i
didn't
want
to
defend
science
fiction
devices
but
i'm
willing
to
defend
hearing
aids.
[laughter]
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
--
i
think
not.
i
think
this
is
--
no
--
no
real
development,
scientifically
over
the
device
used
in
goldman,
and
i
was
about
to
describe
the
nature
of
it
so
you
could
see
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
olmsted,
well,
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
don't
think
so.
they
had
microphones
then
as
they
do
now.
i
don't
know
that
they
had
the
spike
attached.
i
think
that
that's
probably
not
invention
to
put
a
spike
on
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
isn't
any
basic
difference
than
this.
this
has
got
the
microphone
which
you
speak
into
in
the
telephone.
i
don't
know
if
it's
a
crystal
microphone
or
a
carbon
microphone.
i
just
don't
know.
but
it
--
and
it's
--
this
--
this
device
here
is
the
electric
power
pack
with
a
--
with
a
little
battery
in
it
that
amplifies
the
sound
so
it
could
be
heard
in
the
--
in
the
earphones.
it's
not
like
radar.
this
doesn't
bounce
waves
off
from
anything
that
comes
back
to
anybody.
this
is
just
a
--
a
microphone
which
is
made
more
sensitive
to
sounds
which
come
to
it
by
the
insertion
of
the
spike
in
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
earphones
come
from
a
wire
--
that
comes
from
the
power
pack
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
to
the
--
it's
all
--
there
are
three
units
that
connect
together
by
wire.
i
think
the
use
of
this
device
in
the
present
case
illustrates
both
its
use
and
its
limitations.
the
officers
in
their
apartment
next
door
to
the
gambling
headquarters
could,
without
the
use
of
any
aids
whatsoever,
hear
what
was
going
on
in
the
next
room.
there's
evidence
in
this
case
at
page
68,
part
of
the
evidence
in
the
trial,
that
they
heard
gambling
transactions
without
the
use
of
any
device,
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
68,
"in
the
afternoon
about
2:45,
i
entered
the
premises
and
was
able
to
overhear
mr.
martin
and
mr.
schwartz
quoting
the
yards
in
the
baseball
game."
"on
that
date,
the
29th,
you
did
not
use
any
electronic
device."
"no,
sir.
i
just
had
my
ear
to
the
wall."
this
was
evidence
in
this
case.
so,
they
could
hear
but
they
couldn't
hear
very
well.
there
were
things
that
--
that
they
missed.
so,
they
aided
their
hearing
somewhat
by
taking
an
ordinary
water
glass,
a
tumbler,
and
they
put
it
against
the
wall
and
they
listen
to
the
bottom
end
of
this
glass.
this
way,
they
could
hear
better.
with
this
device
which
they
pushed
underneath
the
--
the
baseboard
into
a
crack
which
exited
there,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
this
wasn't
--
no
structural
damage
change
was
made
in
the
wall.
there
was
an
aperture
and
this
was
merely
pushed
in
by
the
man's
thumbs.
it
wasn't
hammered
in.
there
was
no
change
made
in
the
party
wall.
that
was
pushed
under
the
--
under
the
--
the
baseboard
and,
with
this,
they
could
hear
very
well
because
we
find
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
overwhelmingly
specific
that
these
particular
defendants
were
engaged
in
violation
of
law.
now,
the
petitioner
does
not
claim
that
this
spike
went
inside
of
the
defendant's
room
in
the
sense
that
it
penetrated
the
wall
and
came
through.
there
was
a
question
whether
it
penetrated
the
duct.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
isn't,
and
it
didn't.
and,
there's
no
claim
that
it
did.
there
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
couldn't.
then,
the
question
was
asked
whether
it
penetrated
the
rear
and
the
back
of
the
heating
duct.
now,
in
the
first
place,
the
evidence
is
--
it's
not
admitted
that
this
ever
touched
the
heating
duct.
witnesses
for
the
defendant
claimed
that
it
had
been
pressed
in
at
a
place
where
it
touched
the
heating
duct
and
it
made
small
indentations,
not
perforations,
but
indentations
on
the
back
of
that
duct.
this
is
evidence
solely
by
the
defendants'
witnesses.
it's
not
the
government's
--
governance
evidence
was
that
it
would
not
have
gone
far
enough
to
touch
that
duct
even
if
it
had
been
in
a
line
with
the
duct.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
touched
some
unidentified
obstruction
in
the
wall,
something
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
know
if
that
was
resonant
or
not.
it
was
something
which
enabled
them
to
hear
through
the
--
through
the
earphones.
it
was
something
which
conducted
sound,
if
that's
what
you
mean
by
resonant.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
government's
testimony
didn't
say
it
didn't
but
if
the
government's
--
it
would
be
impossible
for
it
to
touch
the
heating
duct
if
the
government's
testimony
is
taken
as
accurate
because
the
government's
testimony
of
the
three
persons
who
were
present
when
this
was
inserted
would
have
had
it
inserted
about
five
and
then
--
five
and
an
eighth
inches.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
well,
they
didn't
measure
it
but
they
were
--
each
one
of
them
testified
how
far
that
it
had
gone
in
and
mr.
williams
cross-examined
one
of
the
witnesses
and
had
him
mark
off
on
just
how
far
it
was
and
it
was
measured
then
from
the
best
of
his
--
best
of
his
knowledge,
and
that's
at
page
102
and
103.
and
it
shows
that
it
was
much
less
than
--
that
it
was
less
than
six
inches
when
it
was
inserted.
so,
if
this
evidence
is
belived,
it
couldn't
have
--
and
the
evidence
as
to
heating
duct
is
believed,
he
couldn't
touch
because
it
wouldn't
go
far
enough.
i
may
say
that
i
think
the
burden
of
proof
on
their
being
an
illegal
intrusion
is
on
the
--
on
the
petitioner
in
a
case
like
this
because
he's
got
the
heavy
burden
of
showing
the
evidence
shouldn't
be
introduced.
and,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
do
not
know
what
it
struck.
we
could
not
see
in
it
all
we
know,
the
evidence
--
all
the
evidence
says
is
that
it
struck
some
object
in
the
wall
which
gave.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
evidence
which
the
defendant
put
in
said
that
it
had
to
come
up
against
a
sounding
board
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
government
said
it
could
be
hear
better
if
it
was
against
something
that
served
as
a
sounding
board.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no,
not
necessarily.
any
--
any
device
where
the
--
that
would
vibrate
to
the
sound
to
the
voices.
the
voices
came
right
through
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
wall
that
could
have
been
put
entirely
against
the
baseboard
if
the
--
if
the
sound
waves
would
hit
the
--
the
officers'
ears
as
they
sat
inside,
it
would
hit
the
baseboard
and
if
--
presumably
could've
picked
it
up
just
by
putting
the
point
of
it
against
the
baseboard.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
wouldn't
have
been
in
--
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
effect
--
there
would
be
effectiveness
to
the
instrument
because
sound
waves
were
conducted
through
this
wall
and,
presumably,
this
would
have
amplified
them
somewhat.
i
mean
en
--
when
the
closer
contact
you'd
get
with
any
part
of
the
wall,
i
would
think,
would
--
would
improve
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
would
have
been
amplified
somewhat,
your
honor,
whether
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there's
no
such
evidence.
all
i
have
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
is
evidence
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
evidence,
your
honor,
that
these
people
could
hear
these
sounds
sitting
in
the
next
room
without
any
device,
which
is
evidence.
not
--
maybe
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
so
that,
any
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
this
is
so
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
this
is
so,
the
sound
waves
are
coming
through
into
this
room
so
that
they
didn't
have
to
--
in
order
to
reach
this
microphone
and
amplify
it,
it
would
not
--
i
mean,
we
can
--
there's
no
evidence
to
this
effect,
but
it's
--
it's
obvious
that
when
you
got
a
microphone
with
a
device
like
this
that
you
could
pick
it
up
inside
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
testimony
to
that
effect.
i
say
it
can
be
--
can
be
drawn
from
the
evidence
which
is
in
there.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
--
i
would
say
that
this
was
merely
hearing
more
carefully.
i
mean,
if
--
if
they
got
a
man
--
if
--
if
they
had
a
man
with
unusually
acute
hearing
that
they
took
along
with
them
to
listen
because
they
couldn't
hear,
this
would
be
a
similar
--
a
similar
thing.
this
is
a
device
which
enable
the
--
i
--
i
want
to
say
that
i
find
this
device
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
amplify
sounds
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
have
tried
it.
i
have
the
detective
from
the
police
department
bring
one
up
to
my
office
and
i
tried
it
in
the
office.
i
couldn't
tell
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
tried
it
underneath
the
doors.
i
couldn't
tell
whether
mr.
spritzer
was
talking
to
the
solicitor
general
or
his
wife.
i
just
[laughter]
couldn't
tell
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
one
has
a
low
and
a
high
power.
the
one
i
had
was
a
little
different.
it
had
a
knob
on
it.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
make
it
any
better.
i
think
that
it
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
stuck
it
under
the
door
because
the
--
our
baseboards
weren't
up
enough.
maybe
--
i
don't
know
that
it
was
a
bad
test
and
there's
no
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
justice,
this
isn't
--
is
a
--
is
an
exhibit
in
the
case
and,
in
all
seriousness,
i
think
that
this
exhibit
should
be
examined
by
the
individual
--
any
members
of
the
court
that
are
interested
in
it
because
i
think
that
this
case
should
not
be
decided
on
some
theory
that
we
have
here
an
infernal
instrument
such
as
are
well
describes
which
is
going
to
enable
people
to
penetrate
into
other
people's
privacy
beyond
a
certain
extent,
and
i
think
you
ought
to
know
the
particular
device
which
we
have
here.
and,
as
i
say
it's
an
exhibit
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is.
it's
to
--
it's
to
increase
the
efficiency
of
this
microphone.
it's
to
get
to
something
and
to
conduct
the
sound
from
it
to
the
microphone.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
no.
you
ought
not
to
change
--
what
i
mean
is
you
ought
not
to
change
the
law
on
the
theory
that
there
are
some
superb
race
that
people
are
going
to
use
to
--
to
penetrate
to
the
very
depths
of
our
houses
until
that
--
until
there
is
such
a
thing.
i
don't
know
if
there
is
or
not.
the
references
to
the
--
to
the
senate
committee
hearings
are
--
are
interesting.
there
--
there
is
testimony
on
these
--
on
these
gadgets.
people
got
up
and
talked
about
them.
i
don't
think
that
proves
that
--
what
they'll
do,
but
there
is
--
there
is
testimony
of
these
things
in
the
future.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
has
been.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
one
has
had
any
hesitation
about
using
microphones
since
goldman's
day
and,
if
this
is
as
much
as
they
can
do
since
goldman,
i
think
we're
fairly
safe
for
some
time
to
come.
now,
let's
talk
about
this
hitting
the
--
the
heating
duct
and
the
--
and
the
heating
system
in
the
apartment
becoming
a
gigantic
microphone.
in
the
first
place,
the
testimony
does
not
establish
that
it
hit
the
heating
duct.
it
may
have,
it
may
not.
we
don't
know
what
it
hit.
if
the
government's
testimony
is
correct,
it
didn't
go
far
enough
to
hit
the
heating
duct.
if
it
did
hit
the
heating
duct
and
if
the
heating
system
became
a
gigantic
microphone,
the
only
things
that
were
heard
in
the
next
room
were
from
the
room
next
door
where
the
gambling
operations
were
taking
place
and,
in
one
case,
it
was
heard
partly
by
ear
and
partly
with
this
machine
in
the
stairway,
in
the
entryway
where
people
came
in
downstairs,
just
as
they
came
in
--
in
the
house.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
well,
the
gambling
premises
were
on
the
second
floor.
this
was
on
the
second
floor.
this
is
called
a
dwelling
house
and
it
is
a
dwelling
house
in
a
sense
that
it's
made
for
people
to
live
in,
but
no
one
was
living
in
it.
it
was
--
this
was
used
solely
as
a
gambling
headquarters
at
the
time
of
this
--
of
this
operation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
if
in
fact
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it's
clear
that
it
could
be
heard
in
the
stairway
in
the
hall
where
people
came
in
as
well
as
that
one
room,
but
that
is
the
extent
of
the
testimony.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there's
no
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
on
that.
i
don't
know
whether
it
could
be
heard
in
the
other
rooms
or
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
from
the
--
it
came
to
the
room
directly
opposite,
the
room
where
the
spike
was
inserted
except,
as
i
say,
for
one
instance
where
a
man
came
in
and
knocked
on
the
door
and
the
agents
could
hear
him
come
into
the
house
and
could
hear
him
speak.
and
in
that
case,
he
wasn't
in
the
room
and
they
could
hear
that
one
conversation,
and
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
took
place
on
a
series
of
days.i
think
there
were
three
or
four
days.
what
would
happen
is
that
the
agents,
and
these
agents
were
internal
revenue
agents
and
the
metropolitan
police,
would
enter
this
house
around
noon
or
little
before
noon
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
would
come
in
around
--
i
think,
early
in
the
afternoon
and
they
would
conduct
their
betting
operations
for
that
day's
ballgames
and
the
prize
fights
that
night
throughout
the
afternoon
into
the
evening.
and
so,
the
agents
would
be
there
eight
hours
from
noon
until
8,
10
o'clock.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
no
recordings
made.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
--
there
were
many,
yes.
there
were
--
the
--
the
testimony
in
the
case
shows
not
four
or
five
bets
being
placed,
but
hundreds
of
bets
being
placed
that
were
heard.
i
mean,
they
didn't
attempt
to
give
them
all.
they
--
they
gave
the
testimony
as
10
or
15
on
this
day
and
10
or
15,
but
it's
quite
apparent
they
heard
hundreds
of
bets
being
placed.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
they
had
notes
that
were
made
in
which
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
really
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
were
there
persons
in
the
other
rooms?
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
went
anywhere,
but
this
single
room
that
was
used
as
a
betting
headquarters.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
on
the
basis
of
this
--
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
which
was
obtained
--
on
the
basis
of
what
was
overheard,
they
got
the
search
warrant
and
arrest
warrant,
and
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
one
of
the
people
they
picked
up
is
he
left
the
building.
the
other
--
another
person
was
in
the
--
in
the
gambling
room.
no
one
was
in
any
other
room
at
the
time
they
went
in.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
not
before
but
without
the
aid
of
this
contrivance.
this,
actually,
was
heard
on
the
29th
and
--
and
the
contrivance
had
been
used
in
the
22nd,
23rd
and
24th
as
i
recall.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
evidence
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
they
--
they
did
go
into
the
--
into
the
building
first,
the
place
where
they
had
permission
to
go,
410.
they
went
in
without
the
device,
and
i
think
the
evidence
is
that
they
felt
that
they
could
hear
something
next
door.
they
didn't
have
the
device.
they
went
in
early
in,
as
i
remembered
early
in
april,
maybe
march,
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
and
they've
heard
sounds.
they
didn't
hear
any
illegal
transactions.
they've
got
no
evidence
at
that
time,
but
it
was
after
they
had
been
in
that
they
then
got
the
electronic
device
and
listened,
as
i
remember
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
am
--
i
may
have
misspoken.
i
didn't
mean
there
was
no
evidence.
the
defendant's
evidence
was
that
this
struck
and
pushed
against
the
microphone
and
the
defendant
brought
in
experts
who
said
you
could
hear
all
through
the
building.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
say,
if
the
evidence
in
the
part
of
the
government
is
to
be
given
credence,
it
could
not
have
touched
the
heating
duct.
they
didn't
--
there
was
no
occasion
when
the
government
witnesses
were
on
the
stand
to
testify
as
to
the
heating
duct.
but,
it's
impossible
with
the
description
of
how
far
it
goes
into
the
wall
for
this
spike
to
have
touched
the
heating
duct
if
the
government's
witnesses
are
to
be
believed
because
they
said
it
only
went
in
five
and
one-eighth
inches
and
it
--
that's
not
far
enough
to
touch
the
heating
duct.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
could
have
touched
a
log,
for
example,
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
log,
a
--
a
board,
a
piece
of
--
a
strip
in
the
wall,
it
could
have
touched
--
i
don't
know.
any
number
of
things
could
be
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please.
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
what
the
record
shows
on
whether
or
not
there
was
a
trespass
in
this
case.
really
hinges
upon
the
same
testimony
which
is
involved
in
--
and
we
were
discussing
before
lunch
about
how
far
the
needle
protruded
into
the
wall.
the
evidence
of
the
government
witnesses
--
under
the
evidence
of
the
government
witnesses,
this
would
not
have
protruded
beyond
the
middle
line
of
the
party
wall.
there
is
evidence
of
the
police
officers
who
had
examined
the
plans
of
the
house,
as
well
as
the
rooms
themselves
that
the
walls
were
13
to
14
inches
thick
and
that
includes
trimming
the
baseboard
and
things.
but
--
so
that
we
get
a
--
we
get
13
or
14
inches
and
the
question
is
whether
--
if
you're
going
to
find
out
whether
there's
been
a
crossing
of
the
standard
line,
it
would
presumably
have
to
be
between
six
and
a
half
and
--
and
seven
inches
but
this
would've
had
to
go
into
the
wall.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
said
six
to
eight
in
the
--
in
the
introduction.
he
--
he
--
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
he
said
that
it
was
a
party
wall
and
that
the
intrusion
into
the
party
wall,
if
there
was
a
trespass,
it
was
de
minimis
and
that
he
wouldn't
consider
it
a
trespass.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he
did
not
make
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
his
only
statement
was
that
that's
right.
it
was
six
to
eight.
he
made
no
finding
that
it
didn't
go
any
further
than
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
a
party
--
yes,
the
principle
cases
that
followed
the
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
and
district
of
columbia
law
is,
apparently,
the
same
as
the
law
in
most
of
the
jurisdictions
in
the
united
states
that
each
party
continues
to
own
up
to
the
division
line,
but
he
owes
their
cross-easements
of
support
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
mutual
support
for
the
--
for
the
others,
so
that
you
can't
pull
down.
you
owe
--
you
owe
the
other
man
a
right
to
keep
it
there,
to
keep
its
post
up.
mr.
john
f.
davis
up
to
the
center
--
centerline.
so
that,
under
that
law,
if
that
--
and
i
think
that
is
the
law
in
the
district
--
the
fowler
case,
i
would
think,
established
it.
if
we
did
go
beyond
the
centerline,
there
was
an
--
crossing
over
the
--
into
his
property
in
that
sense,
i
may
say
that
i
do
not
concede
that
the
mere
fact,
if
it
were
established
that
we
crossed
over
the
centerline,
i
don't
think
that
establishes
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
because,
by
and
large,
the
law
is
that
there
has
to
be
an
intrusion
inside
the
house,
not
a
crossing
over
of
a
property
line,
not
a
trespass,
but
an
intrusion
into
the
--
breaking
into
the
other
person's
house.
i
think
the
leading
case
on
that
is
the
hester
case,
which
justice
holmes
decided,
in
which
there
was
an
admitted
trespass
on
the
land
of
the
--
of
the
defendant
but
this,
itself,
didn't
make
an
illegal
search
since
there
was
no
breaking
into
--
into
a
house
involved.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there,
they
saw
people
come
out
of
the
house
with
jugs
of
--
of
moonshine
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
of
the
house,
that's
right.
but
there
has
been
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes,
but
the
question
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
did
he
go
inside
--
inside
the
house.
i
mean,
he
wasn't
where
he
--
he
believes
to
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
the
hester
goes
--
that
is
true.
it
didn't
deal
within
--
the
agnello
case
is
a
case
where
they
did
go
up
on
the
porch
and
looked
through
a
window
but
it
isn't
discussed
in
the
--
in
the
opinion.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
you
have
to
take
that
there
is
no
definite
finding
one
way
or
the
other
because
if
it
were
six
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
but
--
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
but
the
government's
witnesses
testified
after
judge
holtzoff
had
made
the
--
after
he'd
made
his
finding.
their
--
their
testimony
came
in
the
trial
itself
and
he
was
making
this
statement
on
the
basis
of
statements
by
counsel
in
the
argument
before
him
and
really
stipulated
facts
before
him.
and,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes,
except
that
the
united
states
attorney
didn't
ever
stipulate
that
it
was
six
to
eight
inches.
i
mean
--
but
that
was
judge
holtzoff's
conclusions
that
he
did
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
you'll
have
your
choice
of
sending
it
back
for
reappraising
of
the
evidence
or
reading
the
evidence
as
it
is
--
it
is
here
and
making
your
own
determination
because
there
is
no
determination
by
judge
holtzoff
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
evidence
on
which
the
judges
might
have
determined
that
it
didn't
go
halfway
and
that's
all
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
the
thing.
on
the
other
hand,
the
dissenter
in
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
went
six
to
seven
inches
or
something
like
that,
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
because
it
--
it
wouldn't
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
because
the
question
of
the
legality
of
introduction
of
the
evidence.
this
evidence
was
introduced
before
the
jury
but
no
--
no
instructions
were
given
and
nothing
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
heating
system?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
you
can
--
i
guess,
the
only
evidence
would
be
on
that,
would
be
the
depth
of
the
duct
and
there's
evidence
--
the
heating
duct
which
is
said
to
be
--
well,
the
government
--
the
government
witness
wasn't
very
clear
on
it.
four
to
six
inches.
he
said
this
metal
duct
itself
was
four
to
six
inches.
the
defense
gave
more
accurate
or
more
precise,
i
don't
know
if
it's
more
accurate
but
more
precise
testimony
on
the
depth
of
it,
and
that
appears
towards
the
end
of
the
record.
i
don't
find
it.
i
--
maybe
i'll
find
it
in
a
minute.
but
then,
the
only
way
to
find
out
how
far
it
would
have
to
go
would
be
to
take
that
testimony
of
--
let's
say
--
let's
take
for
the
minute,
six
inches
and
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
let's
assume
that
the
metal
duct
was
six
inches
deep
and
that
it
was
one
inch
from
the
wall.
then,
we
would
--
we'd
know
that
it
would
take
up
about
seven
inches
of
the
14-inch
wall.
if
it
were
less
than
--
here
is
the
--
the
testimony
on
the
depth
of
the
duct
from
the
defendants'
witnesses
appears
at
pages
211
and
212.
he
says
that
the
duct
was
four
and
nine-sixteenth
inches
from
the
wall.
it
went
four
and
nine
sixteenths.
so,
taking
actually
five,
it
would
have
taken
seven
inches
to
hit
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
so,
it
would've
--
if
that
would
--
if
that
testimony
is
to
be
given
credence
and
if
it
did
hit
the
duct,
then
it
would
have
to
gone
in
about
seven
inches,
at
least,
which
would
be
about
halfway.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
that
--
the
metal
piece
itself,
the
metal
piece
which
runs
from
the
pipe
out
into
the
room
is
four
and
three
quarters
inches.
but,
when
you
refer
out
to
the
wall
and
get
the
molding
on,
it
--
it
comes
from
the
outside
wall
to
the
back
of
the
duct.
looking
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
petitioners'
side
becomes
five
and
nine-sixteenth
inches,
if
these
--
if
these
figures
would
be
given
complete
credence.
this
is
the
defendants'
testimony.
so
that,
if
this
is
so,
it
would
have
to
be
--
so,
that's
nearly
--
that's
five
--
a
little
over
five
and
one-half.
it
would
need
six
--
it
would
need
more
than
halfway
to
touch
the
duct.
it
would
have
had
to
have
been
inserted
more
than
halfway
to
touch
this
duct.
that's
why
the
defendant
introduced
this
testimony
because
he
was
tempting
to
show
that
it
did
go
more
than
halfway.
i
may
say
that
if
we're
going
to
take
these
measurements,
we
ought
to
examine
them
pretty
carefully.
now,
this
becomes
very
technical
and
i
--
and
i
don't
want
to
rely
on
it
but
their
testimony
as
to
where
the
--
the
heating
entrance
was
into
the
room
shows
about
18
inches
from
the
front
wall
of
the
house,
and
they
say
when
they
looked
in
there,
they
saw
indentations
on
the
metal
about
two
inches,
i
think
it
is,
from
the
end.
so,
this
will
put
it
about
18
inches
from
the
front
of
the
--
from
the
front
wall
of
the
house.
on
the
other
hand,
when
they
go
around
to
the
other
side,
they
say
that
the
indentation
where
the
spike
was
inserted
was
18
inches
from
the
front
wall.
well,
this
will
mean
that
the
spike
would
not
have
gone
in
straight
when
they
measured
--
when
they
measured
the
distance,
the
spike
would
had
gone
in
through
the
indentation
to
the
--
in
the
shoe
molding
to
the
dent
in
the
thing,
it
would
go
in
at
an
angle
and
then
measurement
as
to
the
distance,
i
think,
may
not
be
accurate.
i
--
these
things
are
difficult
to
appraise
and
this
court
ought
not
to
be
called
on
to
make
that
kind
of
finding
of
fact,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
if
you
want
to
go
and
analyze
those
facts,
well,
you
want
to
bear
that
kind
of
thing
in
mind.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
--
i
think
this
conviction
--
the
conviction
of
this
man
should
stand
in
any
event.
i
think
we
have
a
somewhat
easier
case.
i
think
it
falls
much
clear
--
more
clearly
in
line
with
goldman
if
there
was
no
trespass.i
think
--
i
think
we
would.
i
think
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
there
were
no
trespass,
if
there
were
no
crossing
over
of
the
property
line.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it's
controlled
on
whether
or
not
it
went
more
than
halfway
through
the
wall.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
that's
really
a
finding
of
fact
on
the
entire
record
because
it
was
made
before
else
by
jude
holtzoff
on
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
evidence
was
in
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
determinative
of
--
how
far
it
went.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
he
made
the
finding
originally.
it
was
renewed
before
judge
jackson,
both
at
the
beginning
of
the
testimony
and,
again,
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case
after
the
evidence
had
been
introduced
and
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
evidence.
the
court
then
denied
the
motions
to
exclude
it.
so
that,
you
have
the
preliminary
finding
by
judge
holtzoff
just
made
on
oral
argument
and
then
you
have
the
more
definitive
decisions
by
judge
jackson
made
on
the
evidence
before
him.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
he
heard
all
the
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
was
introduced
before
him.
i
mean,
all
the
evidence
we
have
that
we're
giving
on
the
distance
that
went
in
was
introduced
before
judge
jackson,
and
he
made
the
determination
on
the
motion
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
no
instructions
for
the
jury.
he
didn't
leave
it
to
the
jury.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
judge
holtzoff
felt
that
a
party
wall
--
there'd
be
no
trespass
in
going
into
a
--
it
was
common.
i
think
he
felt
there
was
common
ownership
of
the
--
best
way
i
read
his
opinion
that
there
was
ownership
of
the
party
wall,
and
i
think
that
is
not
--
the
property
concepts
are
not
designed
for
this
--
for
this
purpose
and
they
don't
fit
it
very
well,
but
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
not
the
property
law
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
think
the
property
law
is
set
forth
in
fowler
that
if
there
is
a
property
line
running
down
through
the
middle
and
there
isn't
common
ownership
of
the
wall.
but,
judge
holtzoff
said
--
would
say
that
tenants
and
common
cannot
trespass
on
each
other's
property.
each
one
of
them
has
got
a
right
as
long
as
he's
not
injuring
the
other.
well,
i
think
that
if
this
case
is
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
law
today,
that
the
action
of
the
officers
in
this
case
was
not
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
i
think
the
case
is
directly
covered
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
goldman
case
and
that
it's
--
by
covered,
by
equal
implication
from
the
law
in
the
olmsted
case.
i
would
state
that
law,
i
think,
as
follows.
that,
if
there
is
no
physical
illegal
intrusion
into
the
premises,
there
is
no
illegal
search
or
seizure
through
overhearing
or
through
seeing
what
takes
place
in
those
--
on
those
premises
even
when
one
uses
electric
devices
to
do
it.
i
think
justice
--
justice
burton
really
stated
the
law
in
accordance
with
this
in
his
dissent
in
the
on
lee
case.
he
said,
"this
court
has
generally
held
that,
in
a
federal
criminal
trial,
a
federal
officer
may
testify
to
what
he
sees
or
hears
take
place
within
a
house
or
room
which
he
has
no
warrant
or
permission
to
enter
provided
he
sees
or
hears
it
outside
those
premises.
this
holds
true
even
where
the
officer
supplements
his
hearing
with
a
hearing
aid."
i
didn't
make
up
at
all,
but
"with
a
hearing
aid,
detectaphone,
or
other
device
outside
the
premises."
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
entirely.
this
merely
enables
him
to
hear
more
distinctly
where
he
is,
what
reaches
him
from
wherever
it
may
come.
he
and
his
earing
--
hearing
aid
pick
up
the
sounds
outside
of
rather
than
within
the
protected
premises.
well,
if
this
is
the
law,
and
if
it
stands
up
until
this
case,
then
the
question
really
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
electronic
devices
have
developed
to
such
a
stage
or
the
practice
of
electronic
snooping
has
developed
to
such
an
extent
that
this
court
now
feels
that
it's
necessary
that
this
law
should
be
changed.
and,
i
suggest
that,
in
making
a
determination
of
that
kind,
it
should
be
based
upon
what
we
have
before
us
and
it
shouldn't
be
based
upon
some
type
of
electronic
devices
which
are
mysteriously
--
described
in
--
in
some
other
context.
mr.
john
f.
davis
are
legal?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
there
may
be
--
i
don't
know
how
to
answer
the
question
in
terms
of
just
going
around
listening
because
i
think
that
if
police
officers
are
--
are
patrolling
and
they
hear
things,
whether
they
--
i
mean,
if
it's
their
job
to
keep
the
peace
and
they're
patrolling,
and
even
if
they
have
some
device
that
helps
them
hear,
if
they
hear
things
that
are
breaking
the
law,
that
this
is
--
this
is
not
improper.
i
think
--
i
do
think
that
you
reach
a
stage
of
intrusion
upon
people's
privacy
where
you
reach
violations
of
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
--
as
the
court
implied
in
the
rochan
case
and
some
members
of
the
court
and
the
irvine
case,
that
there
can
be
such
unplesh
--
unpleasant
intrusions
into
people's
privacy
that
it
violates
the
fifth
amendment.
and,
in
that
respect,
we
do
not
have
--
we've
got
a
rather
careful
situation
here.
i
mean,
here,
the
officers
had
information
that
these
people
were
carrying
on
a
gambling
operation.
they
observed
it
from
across
the
street
and
they
saw
people
whom
they
knew
had
--
to
be
--
to
have
been
gamblers,
they
had
police
records,
entering
and
leaving
the
premises.
they
found
that
the
kind
of
equipment
had
been
installed
in
the
house
which
is
used
in
this,
namely,
the
telephone
with
three
or
four
lines
going
in.
it
was
on
this
basis
that
they
began
to
watch
more
carefully
what
was
going
on
inside
the
house.
they
gained
entry
into
the
house
next
door
and
they
used
this
listening
device.
the
house
was,
as
i
say,
not
a
--
not
a
dwelling
house.
no
one
lived
there.
it
was
a--
used
an
operation
for
a
gambling
operation
so
that,
there
is
--
there
is
in
this
case,
if
i
may
say
so,
rather
careful
pedestrian
police
work
which
led
to
the
use
of
this
particular
device.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
would
have
a
harder
case
from
that
--
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think,
again,
under
the
law
that
stands
today,
that
there
is
not
illegal
search
in
such
as
--
in
such
a
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
i
would
argue
that,
under
goldman
--
that
goldman
didn't
depend
upon
anything
else
than
it
l
--
that
we
--
unless
we
would
have
changed
the
law,
that
that
would
be
sustained.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
want
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
want
to
come
to
how
to
protect
the
public
from
that
kind
of
snooping,
and
i
will
in
a
minute
if
--
but
before
i
get
off
with
the
due
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
excuse
me.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
didn't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
might
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
might
be,
but
i
think
it
cannot
be
important
in
the
disposition
of
this
case
because
i
think
that
if
--
i
think
the
stricter
rule
would
be
in
connection
with
the
introducing
--
introduction
of
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
and
if
this
was
error,
then
this
should
be
reversed
as
--
so
that
it
washes
out
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
there
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
then
there
would
be
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
would,
unless
they
have
also
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
then,
there
is
the
--
there
would
be
then
the
further
question
as
to
whether,
on
a
new
trial,
they
should
be
enabled
to
use
the
material
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
material.
and,
i
think
there
would
be
a
--
probably
a
less
--
a
--
i
don't
know
how
to
measure
these
things,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
at
least,
as
you
read
the
cases,
there
would
be
a
less
strict
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that's
right,
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
right.
they
were
--
well,
it
didn't.
i
mean,
it
issued
on
everything
but
there
probably
was
enough
evidence
outside
of
this
in
this
--
in
the
affidavit
because
there
was
the
information,
there
were
the
telephones,
they
were
seeing
the
people
go
and
come
from
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
don't
know.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
describe
them
in
detail.
in
draper,
as
i
remember
it,
they
described
the
area
in
detail.
but
the
question
then
is
how
do
--
how
does
the
public
get
protection
from
this
kind
of
thing
and
i
may
suggest
that
appropriate
--
the
only
effective
way
to
get
real
protection
if
there
are
abuses,
and
there
are
abuses
in
parts
of
the
country
on
wiretapping
and
--
and
eavesdropping,
is
through
legislation.
the
most
that
the
court
can
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
con
--
it
cuts
into
the
constitutional
question,
too,
because
the
type
of
legislation
which
has
been
suggested
by
senator
keating,
in
the
senate
and
earlier
in
the
house,
deals
not
only
with
interception
of
telephonic
communications,
but
also
this
kind
of
thing.
and,
there,
there
is
a
--
he
concludes
a
provision
for
the
issuance
of
warrants.
so
that
--
if
that
kind
of
legislation
were
adopted,
then
the
situation
would
be
that
this
would
be
--
could
be
--
would,
under
the
legislation,
be
considered
a
search,
if
you
please.
but,
if
the
terms
of
the
warrant
were
--
were
met,
by
then,
it
wouldn't
be
considered
an
illegal
search,
an
unreasonable
search
because
it
would
be
the
kind
of
search
which
is
ordinarily
carried
on
through
physical
search
warrants
where
you
give
authority
to
people
to
go
into
the
premises
and
--
and
hunt
the
things
out
so
that
we
can
get
some
relief
on
the
constitutional
ground,
as
well
as
on
the
--
on
the
legislative
ground,
through
legislation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
think
that
this
--
in
this
particular
context
of
this
particular
case,
and
i
don't
know
that
all
interception
cases
are
like
it,
that
you
do
have
an
example
of
the
capital
painstaking
police
work.
now,
actually,
in
this
case,
there
were
no
individuals
that
came
to
this
house.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
money
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
ever
had.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
three
telephone
lines
and,
naturally,
i
mean,
the
--
the
lines
were
--
were
not
intercepted.
note,
there
was
no
interception
to
the
--
from
the
telephone
conversations
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
--
if
he
knows
the
telephone
is
being
used
that
way,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
they
--
they
knew
these
gamblers
--
these
people
who
had
been
gambling
and
moved
in
here
and
put
in
telephones
and
were
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
coming
and
going
at
these
regular
hours.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
didn't
know
that,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
think,
in
determining
whether
to
--
if
i'm
right,
in
determining
whether
to
go
further
than
was
--
than
the
courts
were
willing
to
go
in
olmsted
and
in
goldman,
consideration
should
be
given
to,
as
i
say,
one,
whether
this
thing
is
so
horrifying,
these
things
have
developed
so
far
that
the
situation
which
existed
in
a
time
ago
when
olmsted
is
--
no
longer
fits
--
fits
the
present
picture
and
i
submit
this
--
this
thing
doesn't
show
anything
like
that.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
practice,
with
the
practice
of
wiretapping,
snooping,
and
things
like
that
has
gone
so
far,
become
so
distasteful
that,
now,
we
feel
we
have
to
do
something
different
than
--
that
has
been
done
before
and
do
it
through
court-made
law
rather
than
legislative
law.
i
think
it
may
be
of
some
help
to
the
court
to
read
a
report
of
the
committee
of
privy
counselors,
published
in
1957
as
command
paper
283,
in
which
an
investigation
was
made
in
great
britain
with
respect
to
interception
of
communications
and
the
report
of
this
committee
is
--
committee
of
a
man
who
carry
some
weight.
there
was
lord
monson
and
sir
norman
birkett
and
mr.
p.c.
gordon
walker
who
made
this
report
and,
their
feeling
was
that
no
action
should
be
taken
in
great
britain
to
prevent
the
--
to
upset
the
then
status
quo
which
did
permit,
and
they
felt
lawfully,
the
interception
of
massachusetts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
true.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
as
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
far
as
federal
wiretapping
goes
--
and
as
far
as
the
states
goes,
it's
a
different
question.
as
far
as
federal
wiretapping
goes,
the
testimony
has
been
that
the
federal
bureau
of
investigations
taps
no
wires
except
in
a
very
limited
kind
of
case,
the
espionage
and
sometimes,
kidnapping
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
73,
a
number
which
is
less
than
shows
in
this
report.
mr.
john
f.
davis
just
to
who
--
who
have
testified
that
there
was
73
and
that
there
--
in
one
year.
there'd
never
been
more
than
200,
numbers
which
compare
very
--
very
closely
with
the
numbers
in
this
report,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
none
of
the
--
no
wiretapping
can
take
place
without
the
personal
approval
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
not
the
deputy
attorney
general
or
--
or
anybody
else,
the
--
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
--
this
is
--
the
only
evidence
we
have
is
the
evidence
of
these
statements
which
are
made
to
congress
and
which
i
assume
we
will
accept.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
we
don't
--
we
don't
do
our
investigations
as
well,
but
we
do
them
very
thoroughly.
i
have
here
the
reports
of
the
senate
committee
investigating
wiretapping
and
this
extremely
thorough
report
shows
a
great
deal
of
eavesdropping
by
detectives
in
--
in
some
of
the
states
in
new
york.
there's
a
great
deal
of
information
about
wiretapping
in
new
york
states
and
--
but
no
one,
so
far
as
i
know,
questions
the
--
the
accuracy
of
the
figures
on
federal
wiretapping.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
that
was
their
--
this
report,
too.
i
think
they
handle
them
extremely
well
in
england.
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
as
far
as
the
federal
system
goes,
the
system
which
is
followed
here,
it
appears
from
all
--
everything
we
can
tell
is
--
is
very
close
to
the
same
system
that
they
followed
in
britain.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
if
this
is
not
so,
if
--
if
wiretapping
is
becoming
an
intolerable
intrusion
into
our
privacy
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
dasher's
report
typed
away
from
the
federal
wiretapping
entirely.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
but
the
report--
mr.
dasher's
report
doesn't
--
doesn't
have
anything
on
federal
wiretapping.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
very
extensive
in
many
places,
particularly
in
the
big
cities,
and
if
it
has
become
--
now,
what
the
courts,
if
--
if
this
is
to
be
handled
by
court-made
law,
the
most
that
can
be
done,
may
i
suggest,
is
to
discourage
the
only
type
of
wiretapping
that
has
a
social
--
social
benefit,
namely,
wiretapping
by
police
officials
who
are
attempting
to
--
to
enforce
the
law.
this
will
--
nothing
this
court
does
with
respect
to
that
will
have
anything
to
do
whatsoever
with
wiretapping
by
private
detectives,
by
state
agencies
or
by
purveyors
of
--
of
malicious
gossip,
blackmailers,
i
mean,
all
that
is
out.
so
that,
really,
if
this
is
a
problem
--
a
social
problem
which
needs
correction,
the
appropriate
way
to
correct
it
is
through
legislation
and
congress
has
--
has
been
worrying
with
this
problem
for
a
good
--
for
a
good
period
of
time
and
i
suggest
for
your
consideration
the
bills
which
have
introduced
by
congressman
siler
in
the
house
and
senator
keating
in
the
senate,
neither
of
which
received
--
well,
the
senate
bill
didn't
receive
the
entire
approval
of
the
department
because,
there,
you'd
have
to
get
a
court
order
for
wiretapping
and
the
department's
position
is
it
should've
continued
to
authorized
by
--
by
the
attorney
general.
but,
these
--
these
bills,
particularly,
senator
keating's
bill
will
fetch
not
only
teleph
--
interruptions
of
telephonic
communications,
but
it
will
cover
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
involved
here
insofar
as
there's
any
federal
authority
to
do
it.
and,
it
will
cover
it
not
only
as
far
as
federal
law
was
concerned,
but
it
will
cover
it
in
the
much
more
important
field
where
--
whenever
there
is
federal
power,
it
will
be
outlawed
when
--
whoever
does
it.
now,
the
state
of
new
york
has
already
passed
its
own
legislation
which
outlaws
not
only
wiretapping
but
eavesdropping
itself.
what
they
haven't
done
in
new
york
is
to
outlaw
the
use
of
that
evidence,
of
course,
in
criminal
cases.
so,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
for
--
for
wiretapping
or
eavesdropping
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
is
true.
well,
but
the
--
the
detectives
can
be
sent
to
jail,
too,
if
they
don't
--
if
they
don't
get
a
court
warrant
for
it.
the
only
question
that's
opened
is
whether
or
not
the
evidence
which
is
illegally
obtained
in
new
york
can
continue
to
be
used
in
the
criminal
trials.
it's
outlawed
in
civil
trials
but
it
still
can
be
used
in
criminal
trials
in
new
york.
so,
i
--
i
suggest
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
j
edgar
--
mr.
j.
edgar
hoover
has
stated
that
his
views
only
in
the
--
in
the
special
category
of
crimes
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
he
names
subversion,
the
national
security,
and
crimes
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
involving
danger
--
immediate
danger
to
human
life.
most
of
the
bills
which
have
introduced
--
been
introduced
in
congress,
by
the
way,
would
limit
the
use
of
this
thing
to
the
same
sort
of
situation.
