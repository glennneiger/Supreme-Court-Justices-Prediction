justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
williams,
is
that
a
custom
made
or
an
assembly
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
weren't
there
other
means
beside
that
this
device
mr.
williams
that
he
used
in
this
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
say,
mr.
williams,
it
was
evident
--
evidence
in
the
perforation
of
the
heating
registry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
call
it
a
hearing
aid?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
are
those
things,
mr.
davis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who
makes
that
whole
device?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
buy
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
i
go
into
a
hardware
store
and
buy
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
are
better
devices
than
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
wouldn't
because
this
isn't
long
enough
to
penetrate
a
14-inch
wall,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
physically,
it
couldn't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
in
order
to
work,
as
i
understand
it,
is
this
so
mr.
davis,
it
had
to
strike
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
government
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know,
but
would
it
have
been
amp
--
is
there
evidence
that
it
would
have
been
amplified
to
the
degree
it
was
heard
as
easily
as
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
there
any
evidence
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
degree
to
which
it
would
have
been
amplified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
anyone
who
has
lived
in
an
apartment
knows
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who's
going
to
hear
sounds
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
adjoining
apartment,
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can't
hear
the
conversation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
is
was
there
evidence
that
all
they
needed
to
do
was
to
touch
that
point
against
the
wall
and
this
would
have
permitted
amplification?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
tried
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
they're
government
walls
though,
aren't
they?
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
--
how
far
did
you
insert
it
in
mr.
spritzer's
wall?
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
probably
didn't
get
it
again
in
the
heating
ducts.
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
six
to
eight.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
davis,
may
i
get
back
to
this
penetration.
don't
we
have
to
take
in
the
finding
of
six
to
eight
inches
if
there
was
a
penetration,
whatever
the
significance
may
be,
more
than
halfway
through
the
party
wall.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
am
i
not
right
that
most
of
the
government's
witnesses
put
the
penetration
at
less
than
six
inches?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
defendants
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
bothers
me
for
--
if
it
should
become
critical
in
the
decision
of
this
case
whether
there
was
penetration
more
than
halfway
through,
what
are
we
to
take
as
a
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
detectaphone
or
other
device.
are
they
synonym?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
very
first
sentence
of
this
affidavit
under
our
cases,
a
search
warrant
would
have
issued,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
going
into
all
the
other
details
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
reliance
on
a
reliable
source.
