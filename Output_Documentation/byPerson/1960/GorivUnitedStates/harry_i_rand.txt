mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
impact
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
on
criminal
prosecutions
in
the
federal
courts
where
an
early
trial,
whether
it'd
be
the
first
of
a
second
of
a
string
of
trials
is
terminated
by
mistrial
and
the
defendant,
the
accused,
is,
thereafter,
put
to
a
retrial
before
another
jury
for
the
same
offense.
the
petitioner
here
was
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
criminal
code
in
that
he
had
received
and
possessed
some
20
odd
cases
of
women's
and
children's
gloves,
knowing
them
to
be
stolen
and
he
was
put
to
trial
before
a
jury
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
sometime
in
february
of
1959.
on
the
very
first
day
of
the
trial,
in
the
afternoon
of
the
first
day,
while
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
was
educing
testimony
from
the
government's
fourth
witness,
an
fbi
agent,
the
trial
judge,
without
affording
an
opportunity
to
either
of
the
parties
--
either
to
the
united
--
assistant
united
states
attorney
or
to
defense
counsel,
to
address
himself
to
the
action
which
the
trial
judge
was
about
to
take,
the
trial
judge
acting
sua
sponte
directly
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
abruptly
and
rather
vehemently
declared
a
mistrial,
terminating
the
trial,
as
i
say,
in
the
very
afternoon
of
the
--
of
the
very
first
day.
all
of
the
trial
judges
at
the
time
he
declared
the
mistrial
said
that
he
was
doing
so,
and
i
quote
on
page
14
of
the
record,
“he
was
doing
so
because
of
a
conduct
of
the
district
attorney.
everybody
is
in
agreement
as
we
stand
before
this
court.”
indeed
the
majority
in
the
dissent,
the
dissenting
judge
below
are
in
agreement
that
the
record
discloses
no
evidence
whatever
of
any
misconduct
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney.
despite
the
plea
of
former
jeopardy
interposed
by
the
petitioner,
he
was
in
three
months
later,
again
tried
the
same
offense
before
another
jury
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york,
my
recollection
is
before
another
judge.
and
there
on
the
verdict,
returned
of
guilty,
the
judgment
of
conviction
was
entered
and
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
imprisonment
for
three
and
a
half
years.
petitioner
thereupon
appealed
to
the
united
states
circuit
court,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
appeal
was
heard
by
a
panel
of
three
judges
which
panel
voted
for
reversal
of
the
conviction.
one
judge
dissenting,
pursuant
to
what
apparently
is
the
practice
in
the
second
circuit
court,
the
draft
opinions
reflecting
the
disagreement
among
the
members
of
the
panel
were
then
circulated
among
the
five
active
judges
of
the
circuit
court.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
there
is
no
panel
opinion.
the
--
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
the
panel
consisted
of
judge
clark,
judge
waterman
and
judge
lewis,
a
judge
of
the
tenth
circuit
sitting
by
designation.
when
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
oh,
and
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
the
--
i
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
he
was
on
the
original
panel.
it's
my
understanding,
judge
waterman
and
judge
lewis
voted
for
reversal,
judge
clark
dissenting
from
the
--
vote
for
us,
so
i
think
this
is
set
forth
in
the
first
footnote
of
the
opinion
of
the
--
of
judge
clark's
ultimate
majority
opinion.
and
then
when
the
matter
went
before
the
en
banc
court,
a
majority
of
the
active
judges
voting
for
en
banc
consideration,
a
consideration
by
the
way
which
was
court
of
the
case
without
further
argument
are
further
--
are
just
from
the
original
papers,
judge
lewis
was
disqualified
from
sitting
since
he
was
not
an
active
judge
of
the
circuit
court,
and
we
then
had
in
affirmance
of
the
conviction,
four
judges
voting
for
the
affirmance,
judge
waterman
remaining
in
dissent
and
judge
clark
writing
the
opinion
for
the
majority
of
the
court.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
if
the
record
showed
some
misconduct
by
the
district
attorney,
we
would
then
be
getting
into
an
issue
on
which
there
would
be
some
disagreement
between
us
as
to
whether
that
kind
of
misconduct,
if
it
were
egregious,
could,
at
any
time,
have
constituted
the
manifest
necessity,
reason
of
manifest
necessity,
for
the
declaration
of
mistrial
permitting,
under
the
previous
cases
from
this
court
and
in
other
--
the
lower
federal
courts,
a
retrial.
we
have
taken
the
position,
we
have
endorsed
judge
waterman's
position,
alternative
position,
in
dissent
that
in
no
case
should
the
misconduct
of
a
prosecuting
attorney
be
permitted
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
mistrial
and
subjection
of
defendant
to
a
retrial
without
the
defendant's
consent.
and
the
--
the
rationale
--
the
--
the
--
of
that
theory
--
of
that
doctrine,
which
judge
waterman
urges,
is
set
forth
more
eloquently
in
his
dissent
than
i
can
repeat
it
here.
that
is
his
position
that
even
if
there
were
misconducts,
such
misconducts
should
never
serve
as
a
basis
for
a
mistrial
permitting
retrial
without
the
consent
of
the
defendant.
but
this
case
does
not
present
that
issue
directly
because
in
this
case
everybody
is
in
agreement
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
did
not
engage
in
misconduct.
and
there
is
one
further
fact,
fundamental
fact,
about
which,
i
think,
everyone
is
in
agreement,
certainly,
the
government
in
its
brief
indicates
agreement
that
there
doesn't
appear
to
be
any
necessity
of
record
for
the
declaration
of
mistrial.
in
other
words
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
not
--
not
affirmative
misconduct,
perhaps
some
sort
of
well,
unexplained
conduct.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
i
don't
--
irrational
conduct
without
suggesting
that
i
used
the
word
"rational"
invidiously,
but
no
conduct
which
has
been
rationalized
in
the
record
which
we
have
here.
now,
the
majority
below,
the
majority
below
says
that
it
appears
clear
to
the
majority
that
what
the
judge
was
doing
in
an
over
assiduous,
to
use
that
term,
in
an
oversolicitous
efforts
to
protect
the
defendant.
what
the
judge
was
doing
was
declaring
a
mistrial
because
he
thought
the
prosecutor
had
engaged
in
misconduct
by
asking
a
question.
judge
waterman,
i
do
not
believe,
shares
that
feeling
that
--
that
appears
to
be
clear
from
the
record.
the
fact
is
that
the
record
discloses
no
misconduct
because
the
majority
and
the
dissent
of
judge
waterman
are
in
agreement
that
there
was
no
disconduct
--
misconduct.
and
the
record
discloses
merely
precipitous
action
by
the
trial
judge
without
any
request
for
a
mistrial
by
the
defense
counsel
and
so
we
are
confronted,
as
i
say
here,
and
i
may
as
well
open
my
argument
with
this
long
proposition,
we're
confronted
with
a
situation
where,
i
think,
there
can
be
no
dispute,
but
that
the
record
discloses
no
necessity
whatever,
no
manifest
necessity
and
no
necessity
whatever
for
the
mistrial
declaration.
indeed,
the
government,
in
its
brief,
characterizes
the
trial
judge's
action
as
seemingly
capricious.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
there
was
no
objection
made
because
none
could
be
made,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
witness
was
being
examined.
the
jury
was
sitting
in
the
box.
the
trial
judge
had
not
indicated
that
he
was
going
to
declare
a
mistrial,
except
he'd
indicated
that
he
was
angry
at
the
prosecuting
attorney.
and
he
suddenly
declared,
as
your
honor
will
note
at
pages
--
page
14
of
the
record,
"i
direct
the
jury
--
juror
to
step
out
of
the
box,
i
declare
a
mistrial."
now,
there
was,
of
course,
no
opportunity
to
object,
any
objection
at
the
time
in
front
of
the
jury
would
have
been
futile.
and
indeed,
the
government
in
its
opposition
to
our
brief
--
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
has
suggested
or
stated
rather
clearly
that
the
question
of
waiver
here
by
failing
to
object
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
now,
in
--
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
record,
without
question,
discloses
no
necessity
whatever
for
this
--
for
whatever
the
court
did
in
here,
the
government
makes
no
effort
in
its
brief
to
show
that
the
mistrial
served
any
purposes
of
justice
or
any
public
interest
at
all.
there's
no
effort
whatever
made
here
to
show
that
for
some
indefinable
reason,
some
pervading
reason,
this
mistrial
declaration
was
necessary
in
order
to
protect
some
public
interest.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i'm
not
at
all
sure.
now,
this
is
how
the
majority
construes
the
record
but
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
and
if
your
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
last
statement
of
the
court
in
the
colloquy
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
--
“you
heard
me,
i
don't
want
anymore
district
attorneys
coming
down
here
telling
me
how
i
am
going
to
try
the
cases
and
tell
your
chief,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
put
anymore
cases
on
--
before
me,
it's
alright
with
me.
that's
all.”
now
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
--
this
would
indicate
some
sort
of
anger
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
--
as
to
the,
perhaps,
repeated
inaptitude.
so
the
trial
judge
suggested
of
the
prosecuting
attorneys
were
being
sent
into
his
courtroom.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
that
maybe.
now,
it
maybe
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
but
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
the
motive
--
the
motive
and
that's
the
trouble
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
(voice
overlap)
case,
we
have
to
speculate
as
the
motives.
but
the
motive
may
have
been
to
protect
the
defendant
as
apparently
the
majority
thought
or
the
motive
may
well
have
been
to
teach
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
a
lesson
because
he
didn't
asked
questions
the
way
this
trial
judge
thought
they
should
have
been
asked,
and
he
didn't
prove
cases
the
way
the
trial
judge
thought
they
should
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that
may
have
been
his
underlying
and
secret
motive,
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
now,
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
this
is
the
entire
record.
and
the
--
the
colloquy
and
the
examination
which
appears
at
pages
13
and
14
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
--
is
--
comes
from
the
record
which
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
which
he
sets
forth
this
portion
of
the
transcript.
my
--
i
don't
know
what
the
fact
is,
but
i
would
assume,
i
should
have
checked
it,
i
would
assume
that
the
track
--
the
entire
transcript
was
now
prepared,
but
then
in
connection
with
the
plea
of
former
jeopardy,
portions
of
the
--
of
the
testimony
and
the
colloquy
were
transcribed
for
inclusion
on
the
affidavits
of
the
various
parties.
and
so,
this
is
the
entire
record
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it's
the
only
record
that
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
the
plea
was
interposed
before
another
judge
of
--
not
the
trial
judge
either
in
the
first
case
of
the
trial
judge
and
the
second
trial
was
interposed
before
judge
rayfiel,
who
in
turn,
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment,
denied
the
motion.judge
rayfiel's
short
memorandum
of
opinion
is
included
on
the
record.
and
thereafter,
it
was
again
interposed
before
the
commencement
of
the
second
trial
and
rejected
before
the
commencement
of
the
second
trial.
now,
the
--
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
necessity
whatever
record
here
for
the
declaration
of
mistrial,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
showing
here
that
any
public
interest
was
served
by
it,
it
is
our
contention
quite
simply
that
under
the
rule
enunciated
in
united
states
against
perez,
somewhat
more
than
100
ago,
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
below
is
required.
your
honors
will
recall,
because
perez
has
been
before
this
court
on
numerous
occasions
in
the
last
decade,
your
honors
will
recall
that
the
doctrine
enunciated
in
that
case
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
a
defendant
could
be
retried
after
a
jury
disagreement,
was
substantially
this,
that
a
trial
court
had
authority
to
discharge
a
jury
before
verdict
and
put
a
defendant
to
a
second
trial,
whenever,
in
its
sound
discretion,
taking
all
the
circumstances
into
consideration,
there
is
a
manifest
necessity
for
the
declaration
of
mistrial
or
the
ends
of
public
justice
would
otherwise
be
defeated.
and
then
in
perez,
the
court
went
further
to
say
that
this
power
to
terminate
a
trial
by
mistrial,
ought
to
be
used
with
the
greatest
caution
under
urgent
circumstances
and
for
very
plain
and
obvious
causes.
however
flexible,
perez
--
the
perez
rule
may
originally
have
been
intended
to
be
and
the
government
reminds
us
that
it
was
intended
to
be
flexible,
and
however
broad,
the
later
applications
that
rule
may
have
made
the
rule.
we
have
found
no
case,
the
government
has
cited
none
to
us
where
a
mistrial
occurred
and
the
retrial
of
the
defendant
was
approved
by
any
appellate
court,
where,
as
in
this
case,
there
was
absolutely
no
occurrence
of
record
at
the
first
trial
which
afforded
even
a
colorable
excuse
for
the
necessity
of
terminating
that
trial.
the
government
argues
despite
the
fact,
there
clearly
was
no
necessity,
insofar
as
we
can
find
here,
for
what
the
trial
judge
did.
the
government
argues,
however,
that
even
on
a
case
where
there
is
no
necessity
for
mistrial,
even
in
the
case
where
the
judge's
action
maybe
arbitrary
or
capricious,
that
the
bar
of
double
jeopardy
does
not
attach,
should
not
attach,
unless
the
following
occurs.
unless
the
defendant,
the
accused,
affirmatively
demonstrates
that
the
mistrial
declaration
resulted
from
somewhat
"let
man"
motive
on
the
part
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge
to
oppress
the
defendant
or
that
the
declaration
of
mistrial
would
result
in
some
extraordinary
prejudice
to
him
by
virtue
of
his
necessity
to
stand
retrial.
now,
there
is
no
case
that's
cited
in
support
of
this,
a
rule
which
the
government
advances
here.
it's
a
rule,
i
suppose,
which
i
might,
for
purposes
of
brevity,
refer
to
as
the
oppression
or
harassment
rule,
that
the
accused
must
show
oppression
or
harassment
to
him
by
the
prosecutor
or
by
the
trial
judge
before
he
can
happily
benefit
of
the
fifth
amendment
double
jeopardy
proscription.
now,
we
know
of
no
case
supporting
that
rule.
the
government
cites
none.
moreover,
it's
our
position
that
upon
analysis,
the
rule
is
impossible
of
application.
the
evils,
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
were
intended
to
guard
against,
were
summarized
by
this
court
only
recently
in
the
green
case
and
again
in
the
(inaudible)
case
as
follows,
that
a
person
shall
not
be
harassed
by
successive
trials,
that
an
accused
shall
not
have
to
marshal
the
resources
and
energies
necessary
for
his
defense
more
than
once
and
that
the
state,
with
all
its
resources
and
power,
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
repeated
attempts
to
convict
an
individual
for
an
alleged
offense,
thereby
subjecting
him
to
embarrassment,
expense
and
ordeal
and
compelling
him
to
live
in
a
continued
state
of
anxiety
and
insecurity.
now,
against
the
backdrop
of
these
evils,
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
constitution
to
protect
against,
to
prevent,
let
us
consider
what
the
harassment
or
oppression
rule
advanced
by
the
government
would
involve.
would
then
a
trial
judge
before
he
could
determine
whether
a
mistrial
should
be
declared
and
without
loosing
the
--
the
government
the
right
to
retry
this
defendant,
must
the
trial
judge
then
or
review
in
court
when
it
has
to
determine
whether
a
mistrial
declaration
was
appropriate
in
the
first
instance,
must
the
trial
judge
of
the
reviewing
court
then
inquire
as
to
particular
defendant's
financial
resources?
must
he
inquire
as
to
the
capacity
of
the
particular
defendant
to
withstand
the
emotional
stress
of
anxiety
and
insecurity
by
reason
of
his
continued
subjection
to
criminal
prosecution?
must
he
inquire
as
to
the
ability
of
this
particular
defendant
to
produce
these
particular
witnesses
that
he
needs
for
defense
at
some
later
date?
must
the
trial
judge
of
the
reviewing
court
inquire
as
to
the
availability
of
counsel
for
this
particular
defendant?
must
they
inquire
into
such
light
matters?
is
the
constitutional
right
to
be
free
of
successive
trials
for
the
same
offense,
then
to
turn
on
such
quantitative
inquiries?
and
since
such
measurements,
such
quantitative
inquiries
must
necessarily
vary
from
individual
to
individual,
from
rich
man
to
poor
man,
doesn't
the
doctrine,
doesn't
the
rule,
which
the
government
suggests
here,
raise
serious
questions
as
to
equal
protection
of
the
laws?
in
short,
a
declaration
of
mistrial
may
be
oppressive
to
a
poor
defendant
who
has
paid
his
last
penny
for
counsel
because
he
cannot
afford
counsel
for
his
--
next
trial.
whereas,
it
may
not
at
all
be
oppressive
for
the
rich
man
who
has
plenty
of
money
to
support
counsel
throughout
many
successive
trials.
this
is
the
kind
of
measurement
which
undoubtedly
would
be
required
if
the
government
rule
of
harassment
or
oppression,
the
burden
placed
on
a
defendant
to
show
harassment
or
oppression,
would
be
adopted
because
then
the
trial
court
or
ultimately
the
reviewing
court
would
have
to
look
into
just
such
matters.
and
in
any
event,
how
is
it
possible
for
a
trial
judge
to
do
more
than
to
speculate
as
to
what
the
particular
defendant's
condition
may
be
three
months
from
today
or
many,
many
more
months
from
today,
when
the
next
trial
will
take
place.
the
determination
according
to
the
government
rule
would
also
have
to
be
made
on
the
basis
of
some
inquiry
as
to
the
motive
of
the
trial
judge
in
declaring
the
mistrial.
the
reviewing
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
motive
of
the
trial
judge.
our
reviewing
court
stand
to
speculate
as
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
as
to
what
move
to
the
particular
trial
judge
in
taking
his
particular
action.
it
is
our
position
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
more
than
assurance
against
merely
the
mala
fides
of
a
particular
judge.
he's
entitled
to
the
correction
of
error
when
it
occurs
below,
a
prejudicial
error.
and
he's
entitled
to
be
free
from
successive
trials
where
prejudicial
error
has
occurred
in
that
a
trial
judge
has
acted
irrationally
and
is
now
subjected
him
to
the
vexations
and
the
anxiety
of
standing
for
a
new
trial.
he
need
not
--
his
constitutional
right
need
not
and
should
not
depend
on
a
speculation
by
reviewing
courts
as
to
what
moved
the
particular
trial
judge
before
whom
he
happen
to
be
when
an
--
an
--
inexplicable
or
unexplained
declaration
of
mistrial
occurred.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
rule
about
which
i
have
been
speaking,
the
rule
for
which
the
government
contends,
it
seems
to
me
quite
plainly,
constitutes
a
proportion
from
the
old
perez
rule.
because
for
the
--
what
--
when
the
government
says
the
trial
judges
may
act
to
declare
mistrials
even
when
there
is
no
necessity
of
record
to
such
action,
then
we
have
discarded
the
cause,
the
manifest
necessity
rule
laid
down
in
perez.
when
the
government
says
that
a
court
can
act
even
arbitrarily
or
capriciously
to
declare
a
mistrial
and
notwithstanding
that,
the
defendant
can
be
brought
on
for
retrial.
we
have,
it
seems
to
me,
departed
from
the
restraints
which
perez
suggested
a
sound
discretion
in
the
court,
and
we
have
exulted
in
place
of
this
restraint
of
sound
discretion,
as
the
guardian
of
these
constitutional
rights
merely
the
personal
convictions
of
a
particular
judge
that
he
was
doing
the
right
thing
by
everybody,
the
personal
convictions
which,
indeed,
as
it
appears
from
the
majority
opinion
below,
seemed
to
have
been
relied
on
by
the
majority
below
in
sustaining
the
conviction
of
petitioner
on
retrial.
now,
before
i
reserve
some
of
my
rapidly
vanishing
minutes
as
i
want
to
for
rebuttal,
i
do
want
to
point
out
in
conclusion
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
government's
brief
from
time
to
time
suggest
that
what
they
are
urging
here
is
some
sort
of
a
balancing
process,
the
balancing
of
governmental
interest
as
opposed
to
the
balancing
of
personal
rights
by
the
accused
in
a
criminal
prosec
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
no,
no.
i
--
i
wasn't
attacking
the
word,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
was
merely
suggesting
that
although
the
government
--
the
government's
brief
seems
to
be
suggesting
this,
and
i'm
more
for
balancing.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
may
i
be
excused
if
i
engaged
in
indulging
a
dirty
thought
for
just
a
moment.
i
was
--
i
was
about
to
say
that
even
though
the
brief
suggests,
say,
balancing
process
which
the
government
is
urging
the
use
in
these
cases,
that
in
fact
there
is
no
balancing
situation
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
that's
it.
we
are
balancing
what
interest
--
what
interest
of
the
government
does
this
record
disclose,
has
been
satisfied
by
this
declaration
of
a
mistrial.
there
is
no
interest
here
that's
been
satisfied
by
the
declaration
of
a
mistrial.
there
is,
on
the
other
hand,
the
very
real
interest
of
a
defendant
not
to
be
retried
again
as
in
--
and
in
this
case
injured
by
conviction
because
he
has
been
injured
by
conviction.
now,
what
the
government
is
in
effect
saying,
as
i
understand
their
brief,
is
that
you've
got
to
retry
a
man
until
such
time
as
you've
gotten
the
verdict
because
there's
an
interest
in
the
government
in
running
the
gamut
of
a
particular
criminal
trial,
until
verdict
is
secured
whether
of
acquittal
or
conviction.
in
other
words,
the
interest
in
finishing
the
trial,
the
interest
in
giving
the
government
a
chance
to
get
conviction,
says
the
government
--
says
the
government's
brief,
is
more
important
apparently,
is
more
weighty
than
the
interest
of
an
accused
in
being
secure
from
successive
trials.
this
--
the
--
this
balancing
that
is
the
--
the
consideration
of
both
these
conflicting
interest,
however,
was
the
very
issue
which,
as
i
read
the
constitution
and
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
was
resolved
when
the
fifth
amendment
was
adopted,
that
is,
the
founders
or
those
--
that
is
the
congress
that
adopted
the
fifth
amendment
as
part
of
our
bill
of
rights
said,
"we
think
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
government
may
be
occasionally
hurt
by
this."
the
interest
of
the
accused
in
being
secured
from
vexatious
trials
is
greater
than
that
of
the
government
in
securing
a
conviction
in
all
cases
or
even
getting
to
the
point
where
they
can
get
a
--
a
verdict
of
judgment
in
all
cases.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
i
get
it
out
of
reading
the
constitu
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
no.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
i
--
i
think
the
history
supports
me
and
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
your
honor,
i
may
have
misspoken
myself,
but
when
i
read
the
constitution,
because
i've
learned
at
the
--
at
the
feet
of
great
teachers,
such
as
yourself,
when
i
read
the
constitution,
i
read
likewise
the
dicta
--
the
precedents
in
the
courts
and
the
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
alright.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
--
that's
what
i
attempt
to
do.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
no,
i
wasn't
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
mr.
chief
justice.
as
to
the
meaning
of
mr.
justice
story's
opinion
in
perez,
we
have
in
our
--
we
have
in
our
reply
brief
set
forth,
the
reasons
why
we
do
not
share
the
government's
views
of
what
mr.
justice
story
meant,
that
is,
the
government's
view
being
that
mr.
justice
story
was
speaking
only
of
power
to
discharge
and
was
not
addressing
himself
to
the
due
process
clause
at
all.
we
have
not,
however,
in
our
reply
brief,
referred
to
a
statement
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
which
came
across
just
yesterday.
and
we
read
in
green
where
mr.
justice
frankfurter
dissenting
at
page
203
of
355
u.s.
says
with
reference
to
the
perez
decision
earlier,
mr.
justice
story
had
himself
taken
a
nonliteral
view
of
the
constitutional
provision
in
perez,
where
he
found
that
discharge
of
a
jury
was
no
barred
to
a
second
trial,
contrasting
that
with
the
story
opinion
in
gibert
where
he'd
--
he
had
taken
on
circuit,
where
mr.
justice
story
had
taken
a
literal
view
of
the
constitutional
provision.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
and
in
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
and
yet
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
with
all
deference,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
reading
which
the
government
assigns
to,
i
think
this
is
the
gibert
case,
the
gilbert
one,
follows
by
some
other
justice.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
gilbert,
yes.
and
--
mr.
harry
i.
rand
that's
right.
with
all
due
deference,
may
i
direct
your
honors
attention
to
the
language
from
that
very
same
opinion
which
we
have
set
forth
at
page
7
of
our
reply
brief.
we
have
not
given
you
the
cite
page.
i'd
like
to
supply
it
now,
page
1302
of
20
--
page
1302
of
25
fed.
cases.
and
your
honor
will
find
that
there,
mr.
justice
story
appears
to
be
saying,
making
reference
to
the
state
cases
which
hold
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
apply
in
mistrial
situations,
appears
to
be
saying
that
he
agrees
with
that.
now,
i
am
frank
to
say
that
when
i
read
the
statement
to
which
you
have
just
adverted,
which
appears
somewhere
about
page
1300
or
1299
of
25
fed.
cases
and
of
the
statement
at
1302,
page
1302
which
appears
--
which
we've
set
forth
at
page
7
of
our
reply
brief,
"i
am
in
a
loss
to
know
what
the
rave
of
the
robust,"
mr.
justice
story
writing
the
gibert
opinion
meant
to
say
about
whether
the
due
process
clause
did
govern
mistrial
situations.
and
i
ventured
to
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
will
--
if
--
if
you
--
if
you
address
yourself
again
to
this
language,
i
think
you
too
will
come
a
way
somewhat
confused
as
to
whether
mr.
justice
story
meant
what
he
said,
when
he
said,
"in
perez,
we
didn't
--
we
did
not
take
the
due
process
clause
into
consideration,"
meaning
by
that,
we
didn't
consider
it
applicable
to
mistrial
situations
or
whether
he
meant
what
he
did
in
the
--
at
the
later
page,
that
i
think
the
due
process
clause
does
apply.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
in
the
ball
case.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
well,
may
i
just
urge,
your
honor,
the
reading
of
that
portion
on
page
1302.
mr.
harry
i.
rand
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
