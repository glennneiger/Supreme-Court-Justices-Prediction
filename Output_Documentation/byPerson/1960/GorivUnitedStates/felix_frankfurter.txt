is
the
panel's
opinion
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
what
the
panel
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
solicit
--
solicit
--
whether
judge
--
judge
waterman
dissented
when
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
court
en
banc
with
the
use
on
the
original
panel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
aren't
we
getting
to
the
dirty
word?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
verdict
--
dirty
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
get
all
--
you
get
all
that
out
of
just
reading
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
get
it
all
out
just
by
reading
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
i
have
any
history,
would
you
get
all
that
out
of
those
few
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
the
history,
but
you
said
you
got
it
all
out
by
reading
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
merely
get
it
from
the
word,
then
i'd
like
to
have
your
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
know
--
have
we
any
basis
for
knowing
whether
this
judge
has
had
prior
experience
with
this
assistant
u.s.
attorney
and
had
to
admonish
him
in
the
past
and
saw
what
was
coming
and
made,
if
you
please,
too
hasty
or
ill-judged
judgment
as
to
what
was
next?
do
we
know
anything
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
judge
evidently
had
experience
with
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't'
know,
i'm
asking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
very
impatient
and
uncertain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
impatience
sometimes
arises
out
of
past
experience
with
an
individual
in
relation
to
the
present.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
do
know
what
story
himself
said
about
his
opinion
in
perez
10
years
later,
no,
10
years
later
in
gilbert.
you
referred
to
perez
when
he
was
dealing
with
the
problem
whether
as
a
conviction,
after
a
conviction,
the
defendant
himself,
couldn't
move
for
a
new
trial
and
get
a
new
trial
by
waiving
the
fact
that
he
had
been
convicted.
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
justice
story
said
that
the
court,
meaning
his
own
opinion
in
perez,
made
no
reference
to
that
constitutional
provision
or
rather
gave
no
exposition
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
apparently,
he
made
precisely
the
distinction
that
is
made
by
the
government
here,
namely,
the
greatest
historic
distinction
between
either
a
verdict
or
an
acquittal,
when
the
trial
reaches
determination
and
at
cases
such
as
he
ruled
in
perez,
where
he
didn't
even
think
about
the
double
jeopardy
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
twosome.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
10
years
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
meant
--
it
so
happens
that
i
reread
gilbert
only
yesterday
with
all
its
60
pages.
and
that
case
is
as
clear
as
a
bell
that
what
justice
story
on
circuit
was
talking
about
is
that
when
the
trial
terminated
according
to
all
the
english
cases
in
the
state
cases,
the
double
jeopardy
bars
a
retrial
even
though
the
defendant
wants
it.
if
the
court
sees
to
be
the
law,
it
wasn't
--
isn't
the
law
for
a
long
time
and
is
finally
put
to
rest
in
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ball
case,
163.
but
what
he
says
about
perez
and
what
perez
seems
the
best
evidence
is
that
perez
never
refers
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
