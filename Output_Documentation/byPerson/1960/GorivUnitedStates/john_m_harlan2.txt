justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
you
said
at
the
beginning
that
all
parties
in
an
agreement
but
the
record
show
no
misconduct
by
the
district
attorney?
is
there
an
implication
from
that
which
your
case
should
be
different,
if
the
record
did
show
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
politely
is
that
what
you
got
here
is
a
record
show
--
showing
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
judge?
