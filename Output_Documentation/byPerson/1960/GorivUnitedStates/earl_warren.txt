may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief

now.

ms.
rosenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
rosenberg,
does
it
--
does
that
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
mr.
rand
was
--
was
expressing
that
--
that
the
action
of
the
judge,
according
to
your
opinion,
can
be
based
on
nothing
in
the
evidence
and
still
be
justified?
do
you
wipe
out
the
language
of
--
of
perez
which
says
that
this
is
left
to
the
--
or
the
faithful
sound
and
conscientious
exercise
of
the
judge's
discretion?
can
he
do
it
with
--
where
there
are
no
circumstances
that
call
for
discretion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
ms.
rosenberg,
are
there
--
are
there
any
facts
and
if
there
are,
i
wish
you
would
relate
them.
are
there
any
facts
in
this
case
that
would
justify
the
court
has
an
exercise
of
the
discretion
contemplated
by
perez
in
granting
a
new
trial
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
ask
you
that.
i
ask
you
if
there
were
any
facts
upon
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
could
face
a
sound
discretion
in
favor
of
doing
what
he
did
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
you
this?
in
other
situations
where
the
judge
is
to
exercise
a
discretion,
can
you
think
of
any
situation
where
we
would
justify
the
action
of
the
judge
where
there
were
no
facts
of
any
kind
upon
which
he
could
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
either
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
