ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
there's
one
--
only
one
thing
that's
really
clear
in
this
field
of
declaration
of
retrial
as
the
declaration
of
mistrial
and
that
is
that
it
just
doesn't
fit
into
nice
legal
formula
and
abstract
principles
and
the
cases
just
can't
be
reconciled
that
way.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
wade
against
hunter
that
this
is
essentially
a
practical
pragmatic
judgment
that
must
be
made
in
all
the
circumstances.
and
the
history
of
this
particular
problem,
retrial
it
to
declaration
of
mistrial,
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
at
much
greater
length
than
i
can
do
in
the
half
hour
here,
i
think
bears
this
out.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
the
guiding
light
in
the
leading
case
in
this
field
is
this
court's
1824
decision
in
united
states
against
perez.
but
perez
is
really
understood.
its
actual
holdings
only
if
you
consider
it
in
the
light
of
what
was
the
judicial
problem
and
the
judicial
concept
at
the
time
and
then
rather
different
from
our
judicial
concept
now.
in
1824,
the
problem
was
before
the
court
in
perez
was
whether
the
court
had
--
a
district
court
had
power,
and
i
stress
the
word
"power"
to
declare
a
mistrial
even
though
the
jury
had
reported
the
bit,
if
they
were
out
for
a
very
long
time,
they
couldn't
agree.
now,
that
comes
strange
to
modern
ears
but
that
was
the
mooted
question
in
the
whole
field
in
that
period
of
1824.
and
i
think
if
you
read
the
opinion,
you
will
see
that
the
opinion
of
this
court,
which
was
written
by
justice
story,
did
not
treat
this
as
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
when
he
said
on
that
score
was
simply,
"the
prisoner
has
not
been
convicted
or
acquitted
and
may
again
be
put
to
his
dissent."
now,
that
was
his
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
which
he
reiterated
in
his
work
in
the
constitution
and
which
judge
washington
had
--
who
was
also
on
the
court,
had
expressed
it
in
earlier
period.
let
me
say
now,
because
i'll
come
to
it
later
that
that's
not
the
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
that
has
prevailed,
this
concept
that
you
must
have
a
determination
on
the
merit.courts
haven't
gone
that
far
but
i
think
it
is
important
in
reading
perez
to
realize
that
that
was
his
view
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
shared
by
other
justices
in
this
early
period.
and
then
what
they
were
considering
on
this
question
of
power
to
discharge
a
jury
was
something
which,
in
its
origin
and
historical
background,
is
something
quite
different
from
the
common
law
pleas
of
ultra
vires
(inaudible)
and
ultra
vires
convict
in
other
words,
of
prior
determination
on
the
merits
which
was
clearly
the
scope
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
now,
the
question
of
the
power
to
discharge
a
jury
under
any
circumstance,
even
when
the
jury
reported
that
it
could
not
agree,
has
a
very
ancient
origin
and
comes
down
from
the
common
law
which
stayed
to
have
had
a
concept
that
once
the
jury
had
started
to
hear
the
case,
it
was
suppose
to
carry
through
to
the
end.
now,
this
seems
to
have
had
some
mystical
overtones
apparently
on
the
theory
that
the
jury,
as
an
institution,
was
invested
with
the
kind
of
divine
rectitude
that
went
beyond
the
mortal
men.
and
it's
not
such
a
strange
concept
in
the
early
days,
which
when
the
trial
by
jury
had
emerged
from
trial
by
combat
and
trial
by
ordeal.
i
point
out
that
this
was
a
harsh
concept
because
it
was
coercive.
it
coerced
an
agreement.
because
also
by
the
ancient
law
of
england,
a
jury
was
kept
together
without
food
or
fire
or
candle
and
a
nonsense
agreement
was
coerced.
and
i
think
it
was
part
of
the
same
historic
concept
of
the
divineness
of
the
--
the
jury
that
had
been
sworn
to
try
this
case.
that
it
can't
for
the
rule
that
prevailed
in
the
english
courts
that
a
defendant
couldn't
move
for
a
new
trial
because
another
jury
would
decide
it
or
have
the
verdict
set
aside
on
appeal
because
then
again,
another
verdict
would
decide
it.
now,
that's
a
harsh
concept
not
at
all
necessarily
a
benefit
to
defendant
and
if
this
court
in
green
recently
made
clear
this
was
--
this
idea
that
there
should
never
be
a
second
trial,
was
not
one
which
the
constitution
embodied
into
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
the
reason
that
this
concept
that
a
jury
should
not
be
discharged
once
it
had
started
to
hear
the
case,
came
in
the
early
colonial
years
to
have
overturn
the
double
jeopardy
and
was
argued
sometimes
in
terms
of
double
jeopardy
is
historical.
when
this
notion
that
a
jury
was
no
--
not
divine
and
the
jury
could
be
discharged
had
weakened,
in
the
time
of
stewarts,
in
the
old
common
law
tradition
that
you
must
never
let
them
go
had
departed.
it
was
an
abuse
of
the
discharge
of
the
jury
by
the
crown.
and
so
in
the
time
of
the
stewarts,
it
became
apparently
fairly
common
practice
when
the
prosecution
felt
the
case
was
going
badly
to
discharge
the
jury
and
then
assemble
a
new
jury
to
hear
the
case
when
their
evidence
was
better.
as
revulsion
from
that
and
to
the
revolution
of
1688,
there
seems
to
have
been
some
sort
of
an
understanding
on
the
part
of
the
english
judges
that
they
would
not
discharge
a
jury.
now,
there's
a
reporter
who
reports
these
questions,
the
report
as
to
whether
it
really
was
that
they
would
never
discharge
a
jury
or
that
they
would
never
do
it
for
the
convenience
of
the
prosecution.
but
in
any
case,
the
practice
of
discharging
jury
seems
not
to
have
been
very
common.
and
the
question
was
not
definitively
settled
in
england
until
long
after
the
american
revolution.
the
only
significant
case
before
the
american
revolution
was
the
case
of
kinloch.
in
1746,
in
which
the
question
it
issued
was
whether
the
court
had
power
to
discharge
a
jury
even
though
the
discharge
was
for
the
benefit
of
a
defendant
in
order
to
enable
him
to
put
in
the
plea
that
otherwise
would
not
have
been
available
to
him.
and
when
you
read
the
early
colonial
--
post
revolution
cases
in
the
united
states,
most
of
them
discussed
it
in
terms
of
this
question
of
power.
and
this
is
not
entirely,
and
whether
it's
good
for
the
defendant
or
bad
for
the
defendant,
it
is
this
concept
of
whether
there
was
jurisdiction
in
a
second
court
to
hear
the
case.
now,
that's
the
question
that
perez
was
discerning.
and
it
held,
as
the
english
courts
did
later
when
the
question
finally
came
before
them
in
the
nineteenth
century,
it
held
that
there
is
power
in
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
to
discharge
a
jury,
when,
for
reasons
of
evident
necessity
or
he
said
in
the
interest
of
public
justice,
such,
of
course,
is
necessary.
and
if
you
read
the
perez
quotation
on
pages
20
and
21
of
our
brief,
you
think
it
is
fairly
evident
that
justice
story,
at
that
time
and
the
court
acting
in
his
opinion,
was
ready
to
go
as
the
english
courts
did
go
later,
which
is
to
say
once
you
recognize
that
the
power
exist,
you
have
to
trust
the
district
court
and
abide
by
their
decision.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
says
--
i'm
sorry.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
says,
at
page
21,
"this
is
a
power
that
the
district
court
should
exercise
sparingly.
they
ought
to
do
it
too
frequently."
but,
and
i
quote
the
end
of
our
quotation,
erred
to
rule,
they
have
the
right
to
order
the
discharge.
and
the
security
which
the
public
have
for
the
faithful
sound
and
conscientious
exercise
of
this
discretion
rests
in
this,
as
in
other
cases
upon
the
responsibility
of
judges
under
their
oath
of
office.
now,
let
me
say
that
that's
the
position
the
english
courts
took
up
in
the
case
in
1909
they
said,
"we
think
the
district
court
discharged
the
jury
for
a
wrong
reason,
but
he
had
the
power
to
order
of
a
discharge,"
and
therefore,
they
affirmed
the
conviction.
the
american
decisions
never
went
quite
that
far
even
though
perez,
i
think
very
clearly,
implied
their
point
of
view.
the
american
courts
were
never
quite
willing
to
trust
one
judge
and
one
prosecutor
as
being
the
guarantee
for
the
kind
of
abuses
that
they
were
most
familiar
with
that
had
grown
at
the
time
of
the
stewarts,
where
the
prosecution
would
terminate
the
trial
in
order
to
get
a
better
case.
and
so
in
the
federal
courts,
in
the
lower
federal
courts
in
the
early
period,
there
are
decisions
to
the
effect
that
where
the
prosecution
was
terminated,
because
the
prosecutor
wasn't
ready,
because
the
prosecutor
entered
a
nolo
then
even
though
the
judge
granted
a
mistrial
and
didn't
grant
the
judge
an
acquittal,
it
would
be
considered
the
equivalent
of
acquittal
and
retrial
would
be
barred.
but
even
in
that
situation,
even
in
the
historical
situation
where
the
prosecution
witnesses
weren't
ready,
this
court
said
in
wade,
recently,
and
justice
story
said
it
earlier
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
coolidge,
even
in
that
situation,
we
can't
lay
down
an
abstract
formula
that
will
govern
every
situation
we
have
to
depend,
we
have
to
look
at
all
the
circumstances.
and
so
in
--
even
in
the
situation
where
the
prosecution
witnesses
aren't
available,
it
can't
be
said
that
that
ipso
facto
makes
a
second
trial
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
early
and
late,
it
seems
to
me
the
rule
amount
to
this
that
in
the
federal
court
a
second
trial
after
there
has
been
a
declaration
of
mistrial.
in
other
words,
where
there
has
been
no
determination
of
the
merits,
a
second
trial
is
barred
only
if
the
circumstances
of
the
termination
of
the
trial
are
such
that
it
is
properly
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal.
i
think
counsel
has
misunderstood
the
government's
position.
it
is
not
that
you
decide
whether
this
defendant
is
harassed
or
not
harassed
in
--
in
that
circumstance.
it
is,
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
in
both
in
perez,
as
early
as
perez
and
as
late
as
wade,
that
this
court
has
always
said
considering
the
interest
both
of
public
justice
and
of
a
defendant
considering
both
of
interests,
the
question
is,
does
a
retrial
come
under
such
circumstances
that
it
amounts,
that
it
is
just
to
treat
the
case
as
if
a
defendant
had
been
acquitted
because
it
is
fair
to
bear
in
mind
that
there
is
a
right
to
have
an
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
trial.
and
if
the
circumstances
of
the
termination
are
not
such
that
you
can
say
it
is
the
equivalent
of
a
trial
on
the
merit,
then
it
seems
to
us
proper
that
there
should
be
a
second
trial.
and
it's
on
that
face
to
say
--
i
think
this
case
must
be
judged.
and
with
the
court
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
equivalent
of
an
acquittal,
that
is,
if
the
prosecution,
as
i
see
it,
if
the
prosecution
is
not
ready,
which,
until
this
very
recent
case
of
whitlow
in
the
district
court,
are
the
only
cases
in
the
federal
courts
that
we've
been
able
to
find
where
retrial
has
been
considered
bad,
had
been
situations
where
the
prosecution
was
not
ready,
one
way
or
another,
one
case
could
enter
the
nolo.
another
case
of
witness
wasn't
there.
and
the
third,
he
didn't
get
his
witnesses
on
time.
but
those
are
the
only
situations
in
the
federal
courts
where
retrial,
after
a
declaration
of
mistrial,
has
or
certainly
in
the
older
cases,
there
maybe
some
variations
a
little
later,
but
in
the
--
in
the
older
cases
close
to
the
constitution,
when
the
only
situations
in
which
the
declaration
was
held
to
be
barred,
the
second
trial
was
held
to
be
barred
and
they
talked
about
it
in
terms
of
being
equivalent
to
an
acquittal,
this
stems,
i
think,
you
have
--
the
reason
is
very
difficult
to
talk
about
cases
generally
in
this
field,
is
that
there
was
considerable
variation
in
the
states
and
a
great
deal
does
depend
with
the
point
of
view
with
which
you
start.
if
you
start
with
the
view
that
was
the
view
of
some
state
and
which
was
explicitly
rejected
in
perez
that
retrial
per
se
is
bad.
there
were
decisions
in
state
courts
that
it
shouldn't
have
a
retrial
even
when
the
jury
reported
they
didn't
agree
unless
at
least
they
sat
together
for
six
days.
i
think
it
was
mentioned
in
one
case.
that
was
said,
well,
that
was
enough.
but
normally,
you
couldn't
have
a
retrial
even
for
what
would
seem
to
us
very
necessary
reason.
you
start
with
that
point
of
view
obviously,
then
you
say
there
can
be
a
retrial
only
for
a
very
good
reason.
but
the
federal
courts
from
perez
on
have
explicitly
rejected
that
point
of
view.
they
have
said,
basically,
this
is
the
power
that
resorts
in
the
district
judge
and
the
exemption
has
come
where
it
is
felt
that
the
combination
of
the
district
judge
and
the
prosecutor
has
worked
a
situation
which
is
so
oppressive
that
it
could
properly
be
treated
as
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
held
in
wade.
because
in
wade,
that
was
a
situation
where
in
the
court-martial
situation,
the
court
wanted
additional
witnesses
itself.
and
then
by
the
time
the
witnesses
could
be
--
some
in
the
worst
situation
had
changed,
it
was
necessary
to
start
all
over
again.
well,
the
court
said,
it
was
justified
but
obviously,
it
stands
from
the
idea
that
there's
nothing
so
inherently
wrong
in
a
retrial
when
there
has
been
no
determination
in
the
merits
that
if
you
--
there's
nothing
so
wrong
about
that
that
you
allow
it
only
in
the
most
exigent
circumstances,
this
court
rejected
that.
they
rejected
it
in
perez.
they
rejected
it
in
wade.
and
therefore,
the
proper
approach,
it
seems
to
me
and
the
one
historically
correct.
in
--
so
long
as
we've
gotten
through
the
notion
that
you
can
never
have
a
second
trial,
we
will
allow
second
trial
after
motions
for
a
new
trial
if
they're
repealed
and
so
on
in
the
united
states.
then
the
proper
view
is
to
say
an
indictment
ought
to
be
tried
and
if
--
if
preventing
it
from
being
tried
has
come
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
unfair
for
the
defendant
to
continue
the
trial,
then
they
are
ought
to
be
treated
as
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
your
honor,
if
i
say
it
seems
to
me,
it
--
clearly
the
judge
cannot
arbitrarily
agree
into
mistrial
in
circumstances
where
he
says
--
well,
this
witness
isn't
here,
and
i
think
the
government
ought
to
have
him.
and
even
though
it's
the
government's
fault,
i'm
going
to
declare
mistrial
in
the
trial
we're
getting.
what
the
court
has
said,
as
i
read
this
means
to
say,
that
on
the
second
trial,
you
look
at
all
the
circumstances,
but
all
the
circumstances,
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court,
are
not
merely
the
right
of
the
defendant
but
the
rights
of
the
government,
the
rights
of
public
justice
in
the
terms
of

and
just
as
a
defendant
isn't
left
at
the
mercy
of
a
judge,
if
he
declares
a
mistrial
under
circumstances
where
the
fault
is
really
the
prosecution,
so
the
government
and
the
indictment,
which
is
after
all
an
indictment
returned
by
the
grand
jury
and
the
interest
of
public
justice
generally,
is
not
left
at
the
mercy
of
a
judge.
but
the
court
has
to
look
at
it
and
say,
"is
this
the
kind
of
a
circumstance
where
a
defendant
ought
to
have
the
benefit
of
a
judgment
of
acquittal
even
though
nobody
has
purported
to
find
him
either
guilty
or
innocent?
is
that
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
in
time
--
in
kind
to
protect?"
and
i
point
out
to
you
that
if
you're
going
to
say
that
if
a
judge
makes
a
mistake
in
declaring
a
mistrial
that
has
the
benefit
of
an
acquittal.
then
the
more
responsible
the
judge,
the
less
likely
he
is
to
grant
a
mistrial,
even
when
he
thinks
a
mistrial
is
justified.
we
have
had
situations,
and
they're
in
our
brief,
where
a
judge
made
a
mistake.
a
judge
said
something
and
suddenly,
he
realized
he
shouldn't
have
and
he
said,
"well,
this
is
unfair
to
the
defendant.
i
think
we
ought
to
start
all
over
again."
it
would
not
be
a
good
thing
for
justice,
it
seems
to
me.
if
a
judge
couldn't
said
to
himself,
"well,
i
made
a
mistake,
but
there's
nothing
i
can
do
about
it,
except
let
the
case
go
up
and
go
on
upon
appeal,"
and
then
if
the
appellate
court
says
"i'm
wrong,"
then
we
can
start
all
over
again
because
there
would
be
a
waiver
of
jeopardy.
but
just
because
i
myself
recognize
that
i'm
wrong,
i
won't
declare
a
mistrial
because
i
really
didn't
mean
to
find
the
defendant
innocent.
and
this
is
a
situation
that,
it
seems
to
me,
we
will
be
forced
into,
if
you're
going
to
say
that
just
because
a
judge
made
a
mistake
in
declaring
a
mistrial,
a
--
a
defendant
goes
free
although
nobody
has
purported
to
find
him
innocent.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
it
is
alright
to
have
a
defendant
go
free
when
a
prosecution
is
either
so
careless
or
so
unprepared
that
they
don't
have
the
evidence
against
him,
and
we're
not
going
to
give
the
prosecution
a
second
chance
to
bolster
at
the
case.
but
it's
quite
another
thing
to
say
that
just
because
somebody
made
a
--
an
honest
mistake,
and
they
do
occur,
everybody
makes
them,
as
i
say,
we
have
situations
where
the
judge
made
a
mistake.
he
did
something
he
shouldn't
have,
and
he
said,
"yes,
i
recognize,
i've
made
a
mistake.
and
so
i
want
to
start
out
free,
with
the
trial
free
of
this
mistake.
if
a
second
judge
later
on
is
going
to
say
"well,
we
don't
think
that
was
serious
enough
to
warrant
a
mistrial,
therefore,
the
defendant
goes
free,"
he
will
not
be
(inaudible)
to
grant
a
mistrial.
similarly,
there
can
be
a
situation,
and
there
was
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
it's
cited
in
the
opinion
below,
where
a
prosecutor,
in
his
opening
state,
referred
to
another
case.
and
judge
said
that's
wrong.
and
the
defendant
objected,
and
the
prosecutor
said,
'well,
your
honor,
i
didn't
think
i
was
doing
anything
wrong.
i
didn't
mean
to
do
anything
wrong.
if
--
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
have
the
case
start
again
before
another
jury.
well,
this
was
a
mistake
of
the
prosecution
that
caused
a
mistrial,
but
was
an
innocent
mistake.
now,
obviously,
if
we're
going
to
weigh
and
measure
whether
the
judge
did
what
he
did
properly
or
not,
then
even
if
the
judge
thinks
the
mistake
is
fairly
serious,
he's
not
going
to
declare
a
mistrial.
and
perhaps,
i
ought
to
deal
here
with
the
suggestion
that's
made
in
the
brief
at
the
other
side
that
while
the
judge
ought
to
wait
for
a
motion
because
that
would
amount
to
a
waiver
and
then
you
wouldn't
have
questions
of
double
jeopardy.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
would
amount
to
a
waiver
of
jeopardy.
but
this
court
has
never
taken
that
point
of
view
on
the
other
situations
when
it's
allowed
a
mistrial
for
misconduct
of
a
juror
or
for
disagreement
of
the
jury.
it
hasn't
waited
for
the
counsel
in
this
--
make
a
mistake
and
it
can
because,
in
the
first
place,
there's
an
obvious
interest
in
counsel
in
waiting.
you
have
a
situation
where
counsel
simply
objects
but
doesn't
move
for
a
mistrial.
the
objection
--
he
may
always
take
the
chance
that
the
mistrial
is
--
that
the
objection
is
serious
enough
to
call
for
reversal,
if
there
is
a
conviction.
and
this
isn't
unknown
situation.
it's
occurred.
it
occurred
in
the
scott
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it
occurred
in
the
case
which
is
before
the
court
now
called
(inaudible).
it
is
before
the
court
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
moreover,
it's
an
impossible
situation
where
you
have
two
defendants
and
one
moves
and
the
other
doesn't.
counsel
says,
"well,
you
consider,"
but
severance
isn't
an
answer
either
because
there
are
situations
in
which
it
is
just
feared
everyone
to
have
a
joint
trial.
counsels
are
provided
for
joint
trials
and
there
shouldn't
be
an
unnecessary
severance.
and
finally,
i
think
it
has
a
more
basic
objection
than
that,
which
is
that
a
judge
ought
to
be
in
control
of
the
courtroom
and
a
judge
ought
to
decide
when
he
thinks
the
interest
of
justice
require
a
mistrial.
now,
whenever
you
have
a
judgment
that
has
to
be
made
and
a
judgment
that
has
to
be
made
quickly,
there
aren't
going
to
be
mistakes
occasionally.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
bad
rule
which
would
penalize
a
mistake
of
a
judge
in
such
a
way
that
the
responsible
judge
will
be
allowed
to
do
what
he
thinks
ought
to
be
done.
i
think
this
is
a
result
that
should
be
--
had
only
if
it
were
absolutely
necessary
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
defendant,
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
this
is
necessary
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
defendant
because
the
situation
where
a
declaration
of
mistrial
is
truly
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
the
sense
that
it
amounts
to
a
second
attempt
by
the
prosecution
or
even
a
second
attempt
by
a
judge
to
bolster
a
weak
case
can
be
dealt
with,
without
making
the
situation
such
that
anytime
that
the
judge
makes
a
mistake,
what
happened
here
is
that
rightly
or
wrongly,
the
judge
made
a
mistake
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
you
ask
--
if
you
ask
me,
do
i
think
the
judge
was
right?
i
don't
think
so.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
have
the
transcript
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that
--
as
i
see
it,
the
question
is
what
is
sound
discretion?
it
is
certainly
sound
discretion
for
a
judge
to
declare
a
mistrial
that
he
thought
inadmissible
evidence
--
prejudicial
inadmissible
evidence
was
getting
before
the
jury.
now,
the
judge
here
made
a
mistake.
there's
absolutely
nothing
that
one
can
find
that
would
say
why
he
thought
there
was
prejudicial
inadmissible
evidence
going
before
the
jury.
i
do
not
know
and
cannot
see.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
mean
a
judge
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this.
a
judge
has
a
great
deal
of
power
that
simply
is
not
subject
to
review.
for
example,
a
judge
has
the
power
if
he's
sitting
without
a
jury
to
find
the
fact.
now,
he
may
find
the
facts
in
the
teeth
of
the
evidence.
this
still
gives
him
the
power
to
find
the
fact
even
though
his
decision
is
on
the
--
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
wholly
impropriate.
well,
there's
something
in
that
situation
here.
he
has
the
power
to
find
prejudice.
we
may
think
he'd
--
the
basis
for
this,
i
do
not
know.
but
it
seems
to
me,
a
strange
rule
which
would
say
that
if
the
judge
has
some
basis
for
his
action
because
the
prosecutor
mistakenly
--
the
prosecutor
made
a
mistake.
he
can
be
--
the
defendant
can
be
retried.
but
if
the
judge
made
a
mistake
about
the
prosecutors
making
a
mistake,
then
the
defendant
can't
be
retried.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know
anything
about
that.
i
do
know
that
the
assistant
had
been
trying
cases
sometime.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
at
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
whether
they've
had
bad
experiences.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
do
know
the
assistant
had
been
in
the
office
for
sometime.
that's
all
i
know.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
he
was.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
sometimes.
i
just
don't
know,
your
honor.
