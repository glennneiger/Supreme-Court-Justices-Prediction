mr.
george
cochran
doub
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
--
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
refusing
to
recognize
a
federal
right
of
redemption
granted
the
united
states
in
a
federal
statute,
refusing
to
do
--
sell
in
a
mortgage
foreclosure
case
where
the
united
states
held
a
junior
lien
and
was
wiped
out
by
the
foreclosure
sale
of
the
first
mortgage.
now,
the
appeal
presents
for
the
first
time,
the
interpretation
to
be
accorded
28
u.s.c.
2410
(c),
and
whether
it's
explicit
ground
of
this
redemption
right
was
intended
to
apply
when
in
conflict
with
state
law
and
if
so,
is
the
directive
of
the
federal
statute
balanced?
now
these
questions
were
not
determined
in
your
recent
decision
in
the
brosnan
case.
there,
you
dealt
with
the
scope
of
2410
and
drastically
limited
its
application.
here
we
deal
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
where
it
was
expressly
invoked
to
subject
the
united
states
to
process
in
a
state
court.
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
language
of
the
statute
before
dealing
with
the
facts.
it's
found
in
our
main
brief
at
page
33.
and
just
to
remind
you
of
the
terms
of
the
statute,
in
paragraph
(a)
it
waives
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
and
provides
that
under
the
conditions
defined
in
the
statute,
the
united
states
maybe
made
a
party
in
a
suit
to
acquire
a
title
or
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
upon
property
in
which
the
government
claims
an
interest.
and
(b)
paragraph
defines
how
that
service
will
be
effective,
machinery.
and
the
(c)
paragraph
with
which
we
deal
here,
says
that
the
judicial
sale
of
the
property
will
have
the
same
effect
as
to
discharging
the
government's
lien
as
state
law
might
provide.
and
then
it
contains
this
sentence
on
page
34,
where
a
sale
of
real
estate
is
made
to
satisfy
a
lien
prior
to
that
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
shall
have
one
year
from
the
date
of
sale
within
which
to
redeem.
now,
you'll
notice
there
is
only
one
condition
prescribed
for
the
application
of
that
clear
and
unequivocal
directive.
and
that
is
where
that
the
sale
is
made
to
satisfy
a
lien
prior
to
that
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
facts
in
this
case
where
these.
the
farmers'
home
administration,
an
agency
of
the
department
of
agriculture,
under
a
loan
program
for
the
benefit
of
livestock
farmers
who
could
not
obtain
loans
elsewhere,
may
--
four
loans
to
a
farmer
in
kansas.
now,
three
of
the
loans
were
unsecured,
one
of
the
four
notes
involved
was
secured
by
a
second
lien
subject
to
a
$25,000
mortgage
on
the
farm
held
by
the
john
hancock
insurance
company.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
this,
that
there
are
10
federal
agencies
making
loans
to
assist
farmers
and
--
and
business.
they
are
all
serving
a
public
purpose.
they're
not
private
loans
for
profit.
in
other
words,
we
--
this
--
this
little
agency
alone
and
the
department
of
agriculture
has
made
loans
totaling
81
million
as
i
am
told.
but
the
loans,
the
commodity
credit
corporation,
the
icc,
the
rfc,
maritime
administrators,
small
business
administration,
about
five
others,
totaling
a
billion
and
they
all
have
authority
to
loan
on
second
liens.
so
the
question
here
is
one
of
considerable
significance
to
the
united
states.
now,
the
first
lien
money
lender
instituted
a
foreclosure
proceeding
on
its
defaulted
first
mortgage.
and
unlike
the
situation
in
brosnan,
kansas
law
required
the
junior
leinors
be
made
parties
to
the
proceeding
of
the
insurance
company
made
service
a
process
upon
the
united
states
under
2410,
which
was
the
only
way
to
do
so.
and
it's
conceded
by
the
appellees
in
their
brief
at
page
5
that
2410
was
invoked.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
now,
in
its
answer,
the
government
prayed
that
its
claim
be
recognized
as
a
second
--
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
--
if
there
was
no
notice
given
the
second
lienor
and
we
were
not
made
parties
to
the
case,
then
the
sale
would've
been
subject
to
a
--
would
not
have
wiped
out
our
lien.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that
--
that's
--
now,
in
our
answer
when
we
were
brought
into
this
case,
we
set
up
our
debt,
we
asserted,
we
asked
that
our
claim
be
recognized
as
a
second
lien,
that
any
excess
mortgage
proceeds
derived
from
sale
and
you
are
--
to
our
benefit.
well,
there
were
no
excess
proceeds.
first
mortgage
(inaudible)
been
in
the
property
of
the
sale,
were
the
amount
of
his
debt.
now,
four
and
a
half
months
thereafter,
bear
in
mind,
the
statute
said,
we
had
12
months.
well,
four
and
half
months
later,
the
government
attempted
to
redeem
the
property.
and
we
tendered
the
redemption
money
in
accordance
with
the
--
the
federal
statute
and
--
and
we
followed
the
procedure.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
under
state
law,
the
mortgagor
has
an
explicit
right
to
redeem
for
12
months.
kansas
law
says
that
his
right
is
ex
--
his
right
is
exclusive
during
that
period,
so
there's
a
direct
conflict
between
the
kansas
statute.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
now
that
i'm
coming
to
it.
then,
if
no
redemption
is
made
by
the
mortgagor,
during
that
12
months
period,
a
junior
lienor
during
a
three
months
period
that
is
after
the
12
months,
he
may
redeem.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
--
this
particular
federal
agency
claims
that
it
has
the
legal
right
to
bid
in
a
mortgage
foreclosure
sale.
and
that
is
true
in
a
number
of
federal
agencies,
some
i
--
in
(inaudible)
there's
always
the
problem
of
where
the
money
comes
from.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
oh,
yes.
it
depends
on
the
federal
agency
involved
and
also
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
anyone
is
free
to
bid
in
--
on
a
foreclosure
sale.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
there's
a
problem
with
these
federal
agencies
however,
first,
do
they
have
the
legal
right
to
bid
and
most
of
them
do.
but
then
there's
a
second
question,
do
they
need
a
--
an
appropriation
from
the
congress
to
collect
the
money
because
of
course,
when
the
--
when
they
bid,
they've
got
to
pay
off
the
--
all
the
(inaudible)
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
that's
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
true,
mr.
justice.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
there's
no
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
we
were
wiped
out.
we
concede
that
this
foreclosure
sale
wiped
us
out.
now,
when
--
do
say
this,
in
answer
to
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
that's
--
that's
what
i
was
going
to
come
to.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
my
answer
to
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
this
alleged
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
--
constitutional
argument
where
they
say
that
if
there's
a
conflict
between
the
federal
and
the
state
law,
state
law
--
law
must
control.
if
that
occur,
then
you
would
have
to
look,
the
constitutional
question
would
be,
can
congress
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
(inaudible)
upon
the
--
this
condition
that
it
have
the
right
of
redemption.
in
other
words,
can
congress
impose
a
not
unreasonable
condition
to
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
and
when
you
cast
the
constitutional
question
in
those
terms,
you
find
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
on
the
appeal
held
first
that
--
that
the
government's
motion
had
properly
raised
its
right
to
redeem
and
the
trial
court
had,
in
fact,
assumed
jurisdiction
and
that
it
overruled
their
motion.
i
might
say
that
after
we
attempted
to
redeem,
the
clerk
refused
to
take
our
money,
we
then
filed
a
motion
in
the
kansas
for
--
for
recognition
of
their
right
and
that
was
denied.
and
as
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
also,
as
i
interpreted
the
opinion
which
is
not
very
clear
and
i
think
is
ambiguous,
it
ruled
that
the
government's
redemption
rights
are
governed
by
state
and
not
by
federal
law
because
2410
gave
the
government
no
rights
that
were
superior
to
those
of
private
citizens.
now,
what
did
2410
accomplished
and
what
is
the
pertinency
of
your
decision
in
brosnan?
it's
our
position
that
since
the
plaintiff
utilized
2410
to
subject
us
to
process,
and
this
was
the
only
method
by
which
we
could
--
be
brought
in
to
that
foreclosure
case,
the
government
was
guaranteed
its
one
year
redemption
right
as
the
statute
put
it
for
its
protection.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opinion
in
the
brosnan
case
says
that
very
thing
that
the
government
is
guaranteed
a
right
of
redemption.
and
we
say
that
this
is
a
categoric
imparity
by
the
congress.
it
--
it
couched
in
clear
and
unequivocal
language.
there's
no
condition
that
we
think
can
be
read
into
it.
and
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
could've
intended
that
this
right
should
be
dependent
upon
a
state
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
is
perfectly
aware
that
in
most
states,
no
such
right
existed.
and
if
there
had
been
a
uniform
policy
of
the
states
to
provide
such
a
right
in
junior
lienors
or
even
a
general
right,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
the
statute.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
certainly
no.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it's
our
position
that
we
would
be
entitled
to
redeem
from
him.
and
if
we
redeem
before
he
did,
he
would
be
entitled
to
redeem
for
us
--
from
us.
and
we
--
we
claim
that
very
clearly,
i
think,
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
in
other
words,
we
don't
contend
that
this
federal
redemption
right
causes
the
loss
of
redemption
rights
by
anybody
else
under
state
law.
we
say
that
it's
--
it's
an
added
co-existent
right.
and
for
instance,
all
we
are
entitled
to
is
our
money.
and
if
we
redeem
within
12
months
and
the
mortgagor
comes
in
within
the
time
kansas
allows
and
says
he
wishes
to
redeem,
he
can
redeem
for
months.
all
he
has
to
do
is
reimburse
us
just
like
we
have
paid
and
what
we
have
in
the
property.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
it
does.
it
does.
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
devastating
variance
in
the
state
law.
there's
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
change,
it
is
a
conflict
with
state
law
but
i
don't
think
the
consequences
are
really
doubtful
and
that
it's
really
very
painful.
now,
what
are
the
contentions
of
appellee?
we
first
say
this
mandatory
directly
as
to
this
redemption
right
does
not
apply
because
the
united
states
sought
a
permanent
relief
in
the
foreclosure
case.
and
that
was
after
we've
been
brought
into
this
case
and
of
course,
we
attempted,
we
had
to
attempt
to
defend
our
interest.
we
did
ask
the
--
as
it's
been
brought
in.
we
did
ask
that
the
court
recognize
our
junior
lien
that
any
excess
proceeds
that
you
are
--
they
are
our
benefit
and
we
didn't
ask
for
it,
the
court
gave
us
judgment
on
our
claims
which
is
the
standard
procedure
in
kansas.
but
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
foreclosure
case
started
as
you'll
see
from
the
petition
of
the
insurance
company,
its
petition
for
foreclosure.
now
then
--
and
they
brought
us
into
the
case
under
2410.
in
our
answer,
all
we
ask
for
was
that
--
that
our
claim
to
be
recognized
with
the
second
lien
in
any
excess
proceeds
be
distributed
to
us.
but,
under
kansas
law,
the
court
entered
judgment
on
all
claims.
insurance
companies'
claims
and
our
claims
and
they
also
foreclosed
both
mortgages.
so
there
was
a
foreclosure
of
both
the
first
and
the
second
mortgage.
but
that,
i
had
no
practical
significance
whatsoever
mr.
justice
whittaker,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
statute
expressly
authorizes
us
in
the
very
next
sentence
to
take
a
primary
relief.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
alright.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
we
certainly
do.
i
can't
conceive
of
a
--
of
a
more
obvious
case.
in
a
clear
case,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that's
--
you're
right
in
that.
certainly,
we
point
out
that
in
the
sentence
following
the
redemption
when
it
says
in
any
case
for
the
(inaudible)
united
states,
view,
united
states
led
by
way
of
affirmative
relief
for
the
foreclosure
and
between.
now
their
second
contention
is
that
the
--
the
federal
redemption
right
doesn't
apply
on
any
excess
proceeds
of
the
sale
might
possibly
or
conceivably
be
--
be
applied
under
state
law
of
the
junior
lien
claim
of
the
united
states.
well,
of
course
there
weren't
any
excess
proceeds
in
this
particular
case
but
it
is
the
norm,
usual,
established
policy
in
an
interstate
foreclosure
laws
for
any
excess
proceeds
to
go
to
junior
lien
creditors.
so
if
such
a
condition
were
written
into
this
federal
statute,
the
redemption
right
would
come
so
sterilized
as
to
be
completely
(inaudible)
now,
we
say
there
is
no
such
proviso
or
limitation
in
the
statutes.
and
it
cannot
be
read
into
it.
the
appellee
insert
that
the
redemption
right
was
not
intended
to
apply
whenever
it
conflicts
with
state
law.
and
they
rely
upon
the
first
sentence
of
2410
(c)
saying
that
a
judicial
sale
shall
have
the
effect
of
--
with
respect
to
the
discharge
of
lien
as
local
law
provides.
well,
under
that
provision,
of
course
we
were
wiped
out.
and
the
fact
general
provision
dealt
with
the
--
wiped
out
consequences
of
a
foreclosure
sale.
but
the
third
sentence
of
the
paragraph
deals
with
a
specific
redemption
right.
and
under
elementary
statute
principle,
the
statutory
interpretation
and
general
provision
yields
through
a
specific
provision.
so
obviously,
that
first
sentence
deals
with
an
entirely
different
subject
from
the
redemption
provision.
so
we
say
that
while
congress
might
have
chosen
to
subject
our
redemption
right
to
state
law
and
clearly
did
not
do
so
in
this
case.
and
because
whenever
congress
did
not
wish
us
to
have
this
redemption
right,
they
said
so.
their
statute
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
for
that
congress
said,
"we
will
not
have
it."
we
shall
not
have
this
right
in
certain
specific
situation.
i'm
reminded
of
what
the
british
(inaudible)
said
in
quoting
our
petition,
a
british
judge
in
the
pleading
cases
of
the
common
law
because
i
think
he
summed
up
a
good
deal
of
the
law,
of
statutory
interpretation.
it
says
if
parliament
did
not
mean
what
he
said
--
it
should
--
it
should
have
said
so.
and
i
think
that
principle
here
is
quite
applicable.
and
the
final
--
their
final
contention
is
that
if
the
federal
statute
conflicts
with
state
law,
state
law
controls
in
spite
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution.
i'd
like
to
just
point
out
that
when
the
united
states
enters
into
contracts
of
this
kind,
informed
programs
of
this
kind,
do
not
deserve
a
commercial
purpose,
not
to
enter
into
private
business
but
to
perform
a
great
social
public
function
in
exercising
a
constitutional
power
and
the
contract
including
the
notes,
the
mortgages
are
means
of
executing
those
federal
laws.
but
as
i
--
as
i
pointed
out
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question,
the
--
the
constitutional
question
cannot
be
cast
merely
in
terms
of
this
redemption
right,
it
has
to
be
cast
in
terms
of
2410
as
a
whole.
whether
congress
has
the
power
to
waive
immunity
and
enable
the
united
states
to
be
subject
in
the
state
process
upon
a
condition
which
is
not
unreasonable
or
capricious,
we
say
that
question
answers
itself.
i'd
like
to
save
my
time
(inaudible)
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
think
it
varies
from
agency
to
agency.
now
this
particular
agency
has
some
kind
of
a
fund
which
it
has
dedicated
to
certain
purposes
including
this
one.
and
what
--
what's
in
that
fund,
one
never
knows
apparently.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
it
would
have
to
go
to
congress
and
of
course
in
--
in
the
big
--
particularly
in
large
mortgages
perhaps
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
i
think
it's
made
secondly
in
mortgages
to
the
new
haven
railroad
and
other
railroads
to
help
them
from
--
avoid
--
threaten
bankruptcy.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
they
couldn't
be.

mr.
george
cochran
doub
it

it's
a

it's

you'll
notice,
mr.
justice
stewart.
it
says
the
united
states
--
the
united
states
may

mr.
george
cochran
doub
held
by
the
united
states.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
personally
had
held
those.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
kansas
law
specifically
provides
that
in
actions
to
enforce
a
mortgage,
a
personal
judgment
or
judgments
shall
be
rendered
for
the
amount
due
as
well
to
the
plaintiff
as
other
parties
to
the
action
having
liens
upon
the
mortgage
premises.
now
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
the
--
apparently
the
--
this
agency
thought
that
it
did,
but
the
court
held
that
its
lien
was
confined
to
one
of
the
four
notes.
but
certainly
that
was
the
place
for
them
to
find
out.
and
they
did.
and
its
completely
unsound
to
suggest
that
the
application
of
2410
in
this
redemption
right
should
be
dependent
upon
the
refinement
of
the
defensive
measures
taken
by
the
united
states
when
it's
been
hauled
into
a
state
court
under
2410.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
--
i
was
talking
to
another
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
was
talking
to
the
point
that
the
appellees
contend
that
because
we
took
a
--
some
defensive
measures
here,
they
say
affirmative
re
--
we
asked
for
affirmative
relief.
if
you
look
at
page
13
you'll
see
exactly
what
the
affirmative
relief
was
in
its
--
its
most
innocuous.
and
it's
obviously
of
the
character
that
any
junior
lienor
would
have
to
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
assert.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
all
they
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well
first,
if
the
court
please,
we
were
brought
into
this
case
under
2410.
now
we
will
--
what
was
(voice

--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
the
--
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
well,
it
was
--
no,
it
was
a
state
foreclosure
case
to
which
we
had
to
be
a
party
no
matter
how
many
notes
we
had,
whether
we
had
one
or
a
hundred.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes.
that's
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
that's
what
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
true.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
but
here
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
yes,
and
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
the
court
held
the
lien
was
confined
to
the
one
note
very
properly
(inaudible)
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
certainly
do.
well
as
i
read
the
record,
(inaudible)
mr.
george
cochran
doub
as
i
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
right.
i
think
i
think
in
determining
our
redemption
right,
it
should
be
limited
to
that
note.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
to
the
first
note.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
to
the
mortgage
note.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
right.
but
actually
what
is
--
what
is
before
you,
and
why
were
here
doesn't
involve
money.
in
this
case,
we're
here
on
the
major
principle,
the
interpretation
of
this
statute.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no.
not
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
that
you
have
a
difficult
question
on
the
mandate
assuming
you
agree
with
the
government's
position.
we've
given
(inaudible)
to
what
the
mandate
should
be.
and
since
my
time
is
up,
i
would
like
to
submit
it
to
you
or
if
i
have
some
left
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
this
court
should
reverse
and
remand
the
kansas
supreme
court
with
directions
that
one,
the
certificate
of
redemption
issued
to
the
mortgagor
be
cancelled.
two,
the
motion
made
by
the
united
states
in
the
trial
court
for
redemption
be
granted
nunc
pro
tunc
and
the
certificate
of
redemption
be
issued
to
the
united
states
upon
the
proper
--
by
the
united
states
of
the
appropriate
amount
under
kansas
law.
three,
this
should
be
without
prejudice
to
the
general
equity
power
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
to
extend
the
dates
for
redemption
and
re-redemption
by
the
mortgagor
or
other
lien
creditors
as
provided
under
kansas
law.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
i
thought
--
i
think
i'd
like
to
submit
to
the
--
mr.
george
cochran
doub
no,
i
didn't
do
that.
i
left
it
open,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
paragraph
3.
this
should
be
without
prejudice
to
the
general
equity
power
of
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
to
extend
the
date
for
redemption
and
re-redemption
by
the
mortgagors.
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
the
kansas
court
has
done
that
very
thing
in
other
cases
where
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
who
was
entitled
to
redeem
under
kansas
law
in
cases
not
involving
the
united
states
and
where
it
was
necessary
to
act
on
a
nunc
pro
tunc
basis
and
to
fix
new
dates
since
the
other
dates
have
long
transpired.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
correct.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
that's
correct.
mr.
george
cochran
doub
thank
you.
