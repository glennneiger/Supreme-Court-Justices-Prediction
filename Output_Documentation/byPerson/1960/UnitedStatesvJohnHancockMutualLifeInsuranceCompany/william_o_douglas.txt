it
depends
on
the
agency
rather
than
on
the
state
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
with
the
permission
--
the
state
law
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
under
this
kansas
law,
there
was
no
provision
for
the
government
--
for
giving
the
government
a
certificate
of
redemption,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
total
result
of
all
this
is
that
if
the
government
is
--
federal
government
does
not
have
the
right
to
redeem,
then
its
junior
lien
subsists,
i
suppose.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
you
have
the
right
to
redeem,
it
does
but
if
you
don't
--
if
we
should
hold
--
you
--
you
do
not,
under
--
the
state
law
has
a
right
to
redeem,
your
lien
would
still
be
valid,
wouldn't
it
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
no
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
no,
let
me
--
let
me
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
assert
your
argument.
