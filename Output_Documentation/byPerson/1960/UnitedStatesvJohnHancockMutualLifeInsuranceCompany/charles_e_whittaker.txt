justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
condition
is,
it
has
a
right
to
redeem
(inaudible)
acquire
a
lien.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
discuss
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
i
don't
understand.
now
i
(inaudible)
i
don't
understand
that
statement.
it
was
an
action
on
the
notes
and
only
one
of
them
was
secured
by
the
mortgage.
so
how
could
the
plain
--
the
government
get
a
lien
except
the
judgments
put
in
with
respect
to
the
three
notes
that
were
not
mortgage
notes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
judgment
lien.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
mortgage
lien
with
respect
to
the
fourth
note.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
how
is
the
judgment
lien
involved
in
the
redemption
factor?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
that
argument
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
the
person
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
does
not
apply
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
you
--
how
the
government
(inaudible)
the
right
it
would
have,
if
it
didn't
(inaudible)
then
to
the
other
two.
if
it
made
no
claim
to
the
additional
notes
affirmatively,
in
what
you
call
an
affirmative
action,
it's
merely
would
be
coming
in
under
its
right
under
the
statute,
2410
and
under
kansas
law
that
you
must
bring
the
united
states
in.
if
you
must
bring
the
united
states
in,
then
you
can't
subject
to
any
claim
of
waiver
of
coming
in
from
(inaudible)
with
all
--
with
all
the
burdens
of
kansas
law
requires,
because
it's
(inaudible)
as
i
get
your
argument
as
to
the
three
notes,
they
didn't
(inaudible)
it
brings
itself
in.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
it's
just
the
litigant
like
any
other
litigant.
that's
your
argument.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
the
government
had
been
permitted
to
redeem
as
it
asked
to
do,
then
you
sought
later
to
redeem
from
it,
could
the
government
have
required
you
to
pay
anything
more
than
the
amount
due
on
the
mortgage
note,
plus
the
amount
you
had
to
pay
on
the
first
mortgage?
in
other
words,
could
it
--
the
government
have
included
the
amount
of
its
general
judgment
lien
on
the
three
unsecured
notes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
you
got
to
pay
a
general,
unsecured
judgment
in
order
to
redeem
from
a
mortgage
judgment.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes
but
you
had
to
be
a
party
only
in
respect
with
the
one
mortgagor.
