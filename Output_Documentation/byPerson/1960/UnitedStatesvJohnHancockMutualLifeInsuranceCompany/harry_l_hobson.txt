mr.
harry
l.
hobson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
practice
of
this
matter
surrounds
a
fact
which
has
been
under
emphasized
to
say
the
least
insofar
as
the
government's
argument
is
concern.
at
the
time
the
united
states
step
put
inside
the
courthouse
door
in
edwards
county,
kansas
it
did
so
in
accordance
with
our
argument
not
so
much
as
a
party
defendant
but
as
a
party
plaintiff
seeking
affirmative
relief
against
a
codefendant.
the
record
indicates
and
mr.
douglas
indicated
in
his
oral
argument
that
the
united
states
did
not
merely
answer
but
it
filed
its
classification
seeking
specific
affirmative
relief
against
the
hetzels,
the
appellees
here.
it
seems
to
me
then
that
if
a
condition
upon
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
of
united
states
is
a
right
of
redemption
that
that
right
of
redemption
is
lost
when
the
united
states
seeks
to
assert
itself
as
a
plaintiff
rather
than
merely
as
a
defendant.
and
it
is
our
argument
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
united
states
did
when
it
went
into
the
district
court
in
the
state
of
kansas.
the
question
argued
by
the
government
might
better
be
here
had
they
not
sought
the
affirmative
relief
on
the
three
unsecured
notes
that
are
now
a
part
of
the
subject
matter
of
this
action
when
the
john
hancock
mutual
life
insurance
company
filed
a
suite,
it
did
in
fact
bring
the
united
states
in
the
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2410.
but
it
brought
it
in
only
because
it
held
a
lien
on
a
piece
of
property
involved.
but
when
the
united
states
filed
its
answer
in
its
cross
petition
it
was
not
satisfied
to
merely
answer
and
concern
itself
with
the
piece
of
the
property
involved
but
rather
it's
opted
to
seek
affirmative
relief
on
three
additional
notes.
mr.
doub
has
indicated
that
those
were
all
farmers'
home
administration
notes.
actually
though
perhaps
the
governor
of
the
farm
credit
administration
was
in
a
sense
a
predecessor
of
the
farmers'
home
administration.
it
was
the
governor
of
the
farm
credit
administration
who
in
fact
made
the
loans
for
which
the
promissory
notes
were
issued
by
the
hetzels.
one
of
those
was
made
back
in
1934,
one
of
them
was
made
in
1936
and
the
other
in
1954.
none
of
those
notes
had
the
least
thing
to
do
with
the
piece
of
property
that
was
being
traditionally
foreclosed.
so
it
is
our
argument
then
that
when
the
united
states
sought
affirmative
relief
in
the
courts
of
kansas
it
subjected
itself
to
the
rules
and
procedures
of
the
state
of
kansas.
a
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court
and
from
other
courts
indicate
that
a
sovereign
is
in
no
different
position
than
any
other
litigant
when
it
goes
into
the
forum
of
another
sovereign
and
seeks
affirmative
relief.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
act
of
congress
related
to
appearance
in
the
foreclosure
portion
of
this
action.
it's
our
position
that
the
united
states
abandoned
that
position
when
it
saw
fit
to
seek
affirmative
relief
on
these
other
notes
that
had
no
relationship
to
the
foreclosure
action
that
had
been
brought
by
the
john
hancock
company.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
those
three
notes
had
no
relation
whatsoever
concerning
the
property
that
we're
now
talking
about.
they
were
wholly
on
security
except
that
one
of
the
three
was
secured
by
a
chattel
mortgage
but
it
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
is
seeking
the
redemptive
right
on
the
basis
of
all
four
notes.
now,
they
did
in
fact
have
a
lien,
a
second
mortgage
on
a
piece
of
property
as
security
for
one
of
the
four
notes.
but
there
was
no
security
insofar
as
this
property
was
concerned
for
the
remaining
three
notes.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
we
would
still
quarrel
with
the
government
your
honor,
although
i
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
we
would
still
--
still
quarrel
with
them
as
to
the
application
of
this
right
of
redemption
for
the
12-month
period
for
--
for
other
reasons
not
related
to
the
argument
that
i'm
now
making.
our
--
our
position
now
is
merely
that
when
the
government
sought
affirmative
relief
in
the
courts
of
kansas,
it
subjected
itself
to
the
rules
and
procedures
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
kansas.
now
the
laws
of
the
state
of
kansas
provide
for
an
exclusive
right
of
redemption
for
the
landowner
mortgagor
during
the
first
12
months
following
a
judicial
sale.
the
government
would
have
a
right
of
redemption
in
kansas
between
the
12th
and
the
15th
month,
so
that
they're
not
left
entirely
without
a
right
of
redemption.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
the
government
asked
mr.
frankfurter
in
its
cross
petition
that
the
indebtedness
indicated
by
those
four
promissory
notes
be
declared
a
lien
on
this
real
estate.
now
it's
true
as
mr.
doub
says
that
in
so
many
words
they
did
not
ask
for
personal
judgments
against
the
hetzels
on
those
four
notes,
however
in
kansas
before
the
indebtedness,
the
notes
becoming
lien
on
the
property
personal
judgments
must
be
rendered.
our
general
statutes,
section
3107
of
chapter
60
which
is
included
in
the
appendix
of
the
governor's
--
government's
brief
indicate
that
a
personal
judgment
must
in
fact
be
made
before
the
lien
is
imposed
on
the
property
that's
being
judicially
foreclosed.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that
is
right
your
honor.
and
that
picks
us
into
another
portion
of
the
appellees
argument
concerning
whether
or
not
this
sale
was
made
to
satisfy
a
lien
prior
to
that
of
the
united
states.
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
brought
this
out.
the
statute
says
that
the
government
shall
have
its
right
of
redemption
at
such
time
as
a
sale
is
made,
a
judicial
sale
is
made
to
satisfy
a
lien
prior
to
that
of
the
united
states.
it
is
appellees'
position
that
the
sale
here
was
not
made
just
to
satisfy
a
lien
prior
to
that
of
the
united
states,
but
were
made
to
satisfy
the
lien
of
the
united
states
as
well.
that's
clearly
indicated
in
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
as
shown
in
page
24
of
the
record
in
this
case.
the
district
court
indicated
that
following
the
sale
the
proceeds
were
to
go
first
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
actions
and
to
pay
the
taxes
then
to
pay
the
first
mortgagor,
the
john
hancock
mutual
life
insurance
company
and
then
to
pay
the
second
lien
in
favor
of
the
defendant
to
the
united
states
of
america.
so
that
this
then
was
not
a
sale
made
solely
to
satisfy
an
entire
lien
but
it
was
a
sale
made
to
satisfy
the
lien
of
the
united
states
as
well.
then
if
there
were
excessive
funds
they
were
to
be
paid
out
in
accordance
with
the
direction
of
the
court.
but
it
seems
to
me
to
be
clear
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
that
the
sale
was
made
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
both
the
prior
lien
and
the
lien
of
the
united
states.
now
there
is
a
means
that
a
junior
lien
holder
can
protect
himself
in
kansas
and
that
is
by
appearing
in
bidding
into
sales.
our
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
kansas
is
often
held
that
that
is
the
only
way
the
junior
lien
holder
can
be
assured
that
he's
not
going
to
lose
his
interest
in
the
piece
of
property,
because
if
he
should
not
appear
and
if
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
did
not
bring
enough
money
to
pay
for
the
junior
lien
holder's
interest
and
if
the
defendant
mortgagor
does
redeem
the
property
then
the
junior
lien
holder
is
without
any
redress
as
far
as
that
particular
piece
of
property
is
concern.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that
is
true
your
honor.
it
would
not
give
effect
to
that
but
again,
2410
provides
that
it
shall
apply
when
the
sale
is
made
to
satisfy
a
lien
prior
to
that
of
the
united
states.
it
is
our
position
that
this
sale
was
made
to
satisfy
a
prior
lien
yet,
but
the
lien
of
the
united
states
as
well.
the
first
sentence
of
the
statutory
section
with
which
we
are
dealing
says
that,
in
the
event
of
a
foreclosure
sale
the
effect
of
such
sale
shall
discharge
liens
or
encumbrances
held
by
the
united
states
just
as
it
would.
liens
are
encumbrances
held
by
any
other
junior
lien
holder.
it's
our
position
that
if
we
read
only
that
much
of
the
statute
the
answer
to
our
whole
problem
is
obvious
that
the
united
states,
by
virtue
of
its
nonappearance
at
the
sale
and
its
failure
to
bid
at
the
sale,
and
the
subsequent
redemption
by
the
landowner
mortgagor
has
lost
of
its
--
lost
its
interest
in
the
property.
that's
the
effect
of
kansas
law
by
the
judicial
sale.
then
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
united
states
could
have
appeared
at
the
sale
and
bid
had
it
chosen
to
do
so.
and
it's
our
position
that
they
most
certainly
could
and
it's
in
my
understanding
from
what
mr.
doub
had
said
that
he
admits
that
at
the
farmers'
home
administration
sought
to
appear
at
the
sale
and
bid
they
could
have
done
so.
well
that
is
a
means
by
which
the
farmers'
home
administration
could
have
protected
its
interest
in
this
property.
the
mortgage
instrument
itself
provided
that
in
the
event
of
foreclosure
sale
the
mortgagee,
the
fha
in
this
case
could
have
appeared
and
bid.
moreover
7
u.s.c.
1025
specifically
applies
to
this
situation
that
it
--
it
permits
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
bid
at
a
foreclosure
sale
in
order
that
a
loan
made
under
any
program
administered
by
the
farmers'
home
administration
can
be
protected.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
question
here
that
if
the
united
states
had
sought
to
comply
with
the
normal
rules
and
procedures
in
the
state
of
kansas,
it
could
have
done
so
without
any
difficulty.
why
they
didn't
choose
to
do
that?
we
don't
know,
but
it
does
seem
to
us
that
when
the
united
states
sought
affirmative
relief
in
the
courts
of
kansas
they
were
obligated
to
comply
with
the
rules
and
regulations
and
laws
of
the
state
of
kansas.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that
is
right
your
honor,
at
least
so
far
as
three-fourths
of
that
lien
is
concern
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
--
i
don't
know
how
we
--
how
we
divide
this
lien
in
--
into
parts.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
we
do
challenge
that
your
honor
as
parts
of
the
third
and
fourth
arguments
in
our
brief.
it
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
seems
thought
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
no.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
can
decide
the
case
without
reaching
a
question
such
as
they
had
posed,
without
reaching
any
constitutional
issue
and
because
the
court
normally
would
avoid
a
constitutional
issue
with
it
to
do
so,
it
seems
to
be
that
the
case
can
well
be
decided
on
these
prior
arguments
as
to
the
applicability
of
this
right
of
redemption
at
all.
it
seems
to
the
appellees
that
the
statute
has
no
application.
i
think
we
--
in
that
regard
should
refer
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
mr.
doub
has
indicated
that
as
he
reads
that
legislative
history
it
makes
clear
what
the
congress
had
in
mind.
as
we
read
the
history,
it's
not
at
all
clear.
this
court
had
an
opportunity
to
review
that
history
just
last
spring
in
the
brosnan
opinion
and
as
i
read
that
opinion
it
was
the
determination
of
the
court
that
2410
was
passed
because
of
all
the
difficulty
that
senior
lien
holders
were
having
insofar
as
the
existence
of
junior
government
lien.
now
it's
true
that
certain
protections
were
provided
the
united
states
perhaps
certain
conditions
although
as
i've
indicated
i
don't
think
that
this
right
of
redemption
is
one
of
those
conditions.
mr.
doub
indicates
in
his
oral
argument
that
the
history
indicates
that
congress
well
knew
that
there
were
states
that
had
no
right
of
redemption
whatsoever.
and
it
is
our
opinion
that
it
was
those
states
in
which
the
congress
was
concerned
in
order
to
be
assured
that
united
states
would
have
some
means
of
protection.
well
the
state
of
kansas
provides
a
means
of
protection
to
the
united
states
by
first
requiring
that
it
be
made
a
party
if
its
encumbrance
is
to
be
discharge
as
a
result
of
the
sale.
we're
not
going
to
be
faced
with
any
problem
as
mr.
justice
clark
suggested
in
his
dissent
in
brosnan
that
some
morning
the
government
will
wake
up
having
lost
its
interest
in
the
property
without
ever
having
any
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
any
judicial
or
non-judicial
proceeding.
that
can
happen
in
kansas,
because
before
the
lien
can
possibly
be
discharged
the
government,
the
united
states
must
be
made
a
party.
well,
if
they're
made
a
party
then
they
know
what's
happening,
they
know
what
the
laws
in
the
state
of
kansas
are,
they
know
that
if
they
want
to
be
assured
of
protecting
their
interest
in
that
property,
the
thing
to
do
is
appear
on
the
courthouse
steps
when
the
property
is
sold
and
make
their
bid
in
an
amount
sufficient
to
protect
their
interest,
although
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
that
kept
the
united
states
from
doing
that
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
in
order
to
discharge
the
second
mortgage,
the
united
states
had
to
be
brought
in.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
no,
i
--
i
think
not
your
honor.
there
were
--
there
were
ample
means
for
the
united
states
to
protect
itself.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
united
states
can
loss
its
lien
without
a
judicial
sale
when
it
has
no
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
sale
is
being
held
then
it
surely
could
loss
its
lien
when
it
does
have
knowledge
when
it
knows
exactly
what's
going
on
when
it
knows
what
the
procedure
is
to
be
followed
when
it
has
statutory
authorization
to
follow
that
procedure.
unfortunately
again,
i
think
for
the
united
states
they
simply
fail
to
follow
that
--
that
procedure.
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
again
seemed
to
me
to
indicate
nothing
more
than
that
what
the
congress
was
concerned
with
was
to
assure
that
united
states
some
right
of
redemption
in
those
states
where
a
right
is
not
otherwise
it
did.
now
mr.
doub
in
his
oral
argument
and
in
his
reply
brief
has
argued
that
when
the
congress
did
not
intend
the
right
of
redemption
to
acquire,
it
was
very
specific
in
saying
so.
he
says
that
the
congress
used
an
ambiguous
language
and
he
has
referred
to
two
specific
statutes
in
his
reply
brief.
one
of
those
statutes
as
i
recall
is
50
stat
706
now
as
amended
12
u.s.c.
640l.
i
haven't
had
an
opportunity
since
receipt
of
the
reply
brief
to
study
that
as
thoroughly
as
i
should
like
to.
but
i
have
read
and
reread
and
reread
section
640l
a2
of
12
u.s.c.
and
the
way
i
read
it,
it
has
no
application
in
this
matter
at
all.
it
provides
that
farm
credit
administration
or
the
federal
land
bank
rather
may
acquire
and
dispose
a
property
in
the
transaction
of
business.
and
that
laws
which
might
otherwise
be
applicable
are
not
applicable
to
the
federal
land
bank
when
it
is
concern
with
acquiring
or
disposing
of
property
under
that
subsection.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
loans
so
far
as
i
can
determine.
there
surely
is
no
unambiguous
language
in
that
section
concerning
the
waiver
of
a
right
of
redemption.
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
concerning
a
right
of
redemption
at
all.
now
the
government
relies
on
that
statute
for
another
purpose
but
we
have
suggested
in
our
principle
brief
that
from
time
to
time
the
united
states
through
one
of
its
agencies
has
appeared
in
the
courts
of
kansas
and
has
recognized
the
exclusive
right
of
united
states
to
redeem
during
the
first
12
months
following
a
foreclosure
period
or
a
foreclosure
sale.
now
it
happens
that
the
two
cases
to
which
we
make
reference
in
our
brief
are
both
cases
concerning
the
federal
land
bank.
and
the
government
argues
that
the
federal
land
bank
by
statute
is
excluded
from
relying
on
the
benefits
of
the
right
of
redemption
in
2410
(c).
again,
a
careful
reading
of
that
statutory
second
indicates
nothing
about
any
right
of
redemption.
now
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
whether
or
not
the
federal
land
bank
by
some
other
statute
has
in
fact
waived
its
right
if
it
is
a
right
to
rely
on
the
right
of
redemption
in
2410
(c).
at
any
rate
it
appears
to
me
that
the
government
has
in
kansas
at
least
taken
an
inconsistent
position
in
the
past
by
recognizing
the
exclusive
right
of
the
defendant
mortgagor
to
redeem
during
the
first
12
months.
again,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
united
states
has
no
rights
of
redemption
whatsoever.
we
have
a
fairly
complex
set
of
statutes
regarding
judicial
foreclosure
sale,
mortgage
foreclosures
in
kansas.
a
junior
lien
holder
has
from
the
12th
to
the
15th
month
to
redeem
in
the
event
the
defendant
landowner
has
not
previously
exercised
his
right
to
redeem.
it's
for
that
reason
that
our
state
supreme
court
has
time
and
again
declared
that
the
manner
by
which
the
defendant
mortgagor
protects
himself
as
to
appear
at
the
sale
and
bid
in
the
property.
now
the
united
states
says
actually
that
the
fact
that
the
property
sold
for
just
the
amount
of
the
lien
of
the
insurance
company
indicates
that
the
sale
was
made
solely
for
that
purpose.
i
don't
think
it
so
indicates
at
all
it
merely
indicates
that
nobody
else
appeared
who
is
sufficiently
interested
in
that
piece
of
property
to
bid
any
larger
sum
of
money.
the
fact
that
it
only
brought
enough
to
--
to
pay
off
the
person
in
does
not
showed
that
the
sale
was
made
solely
to
satisfy
that
lien,
has
already
been
indicated
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
as
shown
in
the
record,
the
sale
was
made
to
satisfy
more
than
just
the
lien
of
the
first
mortgagee
it
was
made
to
satisfy
the
lien
from
united
states
as
well.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
the
opinion
of
the
state
supreme
court
indicates,
mr.
justice
black
that
the
defendant
landowner
shortly
before
the
expiration
of
the
one
year
period
did
in
fact
redeemed
the
land
and
received
his
certificate
of
redemption.
that's
not
shown
otherwise
to
my
knowledge
in
the
record
although
the
supreme
court
in
state
of
kansas
does
make
reference
to
that
fact
and
i'm
sure
that
counsel
has
agreed
that
that
is
--
is
what
happened.
just
a
few
days
before
the
expiration
of
the
12
months
period
mr.
hetzel
remained
to
be
pertinent
in
the
district
court
in
edwards
county
and
tendered
to
the
sum
necessary
to
pay
the
cost
to
texas
and
the
amount
of
first
mortgage
and
now
has
possession
of
the
--
of
the
property.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
the
law
requires
that
he
pay
first
the
costs,
the
taxes,
the
amount
of
such
mortgages
as
are
--
as
(inaudible)
in
other
words,
you've
got
to
pay
the
amount,
bid
at
the
sale
plus
cost
and
taxes.
if
the
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
if
the
purchaser
at
the
sale
is
required
to
ensure
the
property
for
example
by
statute,
the
defendant
mortgagor
is
required
to
pay
those
insurance
premiums.
he
has
to
pay
interest
on
all
of
these
sums
of
--
sums
of
money.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
the
interest
that
the
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
no
penalty.
i
would
have
to
refer
your
honor
to
the
--
to
the
statute,
i
know
that
he
must
pay
interest
and
i'm
sure
it
would
be
at
the
rate
of
6%
since
that
the
standard
rate
where
no
other
rate
is
made
applicable
in
kansas,
he
would
have
to
pay
that
on
the
amount
that
the
successful
purchaser
at
the
sale
had
to
pay
to
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
--
to
the
sheriff
rather
at
the
time
of
the
purchase
of
property.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
about
seven
months,
because
the
government
as
mr.
doub
has
indicated
appeared
some
four
and
a
half
months
after
the
sale
and
the
defendant
mortgagor
appeared
shortly
before
the
expiration
of
the
one
year
period
during
which
he
had
the
exclusive
right
to
redeem.
so
there
was
a
lapse
of,
i
would
suggest
about
--
about
seven
months.
i
don't
know
what
it
is
(inaudible)
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
he
paid
the
money
that
had
been
bid
at
the
sale.
now
because
the
government
failed
to
appear
at
the
sale
not
enough
was
bid
to
pay
off
the
government
mortgage.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
but
--
yes,
the
--
the
man
who
originally
owned
the
property,
george
hetzel,
is
now
back
in
possession
of
the
property.
he
has
the
title
to
it.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
by
the
sheriff
as
a
result
of
the
sale
and
he
is
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
no.
the
--
the
purchaser
in
kansas
gets
a
certificate
of
purchase
and
he
retains
that
certificate
of
purchase
during
the
period
of
redemption.
after
the
redemption
then
a
bid
is
executed
to
the
--
to
the
redeeming
party.
in
this
case
the
defendant
mortgagor.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
had
--
had
he
not
redeemed
then
the
government
could
have
redeemed
between
the
12th
and
15th
months
then
the
right
reverts
back
to
the
landowner
mortgagor
in
kansas
between
the
15th
and
18
months.
we
have
a
general
18
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
right.
we
have
a
general
18-month
period
of
redemption
and
there's
no
question
about
what
the
state
of
legislature
in
kansas
has
been
as
liberal
with
landowners
in
kansas
as
it
--
as
it
could
possibly
be
by
granting
this
exclusive
right
to
the
landowner
mortgagor
during
the
first
12
months
and
then
getting
in
that
right
again
between
the
15th
and
18th
month
but
there
is
a
period
between
the
12th
and
15th
when
a
junior
lien
holder
can
redeem
if
the
mortgagor
has
not
redeemed
it
in
the
meantime.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that
is
right
your
honor.
that's
right.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that
is
right.
or
the
government
could
have
protected
itself
by
appearing
and
bidding
at
the
sale
in
accordance
with
its
statutory
authorization.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
well
i
--
i
would
escape
it
first
by
saying
that
the
matter
can
be
decided
on
an
issue
other
than
the
constitutional
argument.
then
the
question
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
no.
not
--
not
entirely
your
honor.
although,
i
think
the
legislative
history
might
implicate
a
construction
of
the
statute
other
than
that
which
the
government
has
suggested
but
there
is
an
additional
argument
concerning
the
authority
of
the
congress
to
enter
the
field
of
property
relationships.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
yes.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
would
escape
it
by
saying
that
the
government
waives
that
as
a
condition
when
it
appears
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
kansas
seeking
affirmative
relief.
i
think
that
the
government
is
subject
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
yes,
on
the
notes.
i
think
that
the
government
subjects
itself
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
no,
your
honor.
all
the
government
asked
was
that
the
indebtedness
indicated
by
those
notes
be
made
a
lien
on
the
property.
now
by
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
received
a
judgment
lien
on
those
notes.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that
is
right.
it
had
no
mortgage
lien
on
the
three
notes.
it
had
a
mortgage
lien
only
by
virtue
of
the
one
note
on
which
it
was
initially
brought
in
to
the
court.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
is
our
argument,
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
when
the
united
states
sought
that
judgment
lien,
when
they
sought
the
affirmative
relief
in
the
courts
of
kansas,
they
waived
whatever
conditions
may
have
been
imposed
on
their
initial
appearance
there.
they
subjected
themselves
into
kansas
statutes,
rules,
and
procedures.
the
kansas
procedure
provides
that
the
defendant
mortgagor
shall
have
the
first
12
months
exclusively
in
which
to
redeem.
and
i
think
that
the
government
waived
its
12-month
right
by
seeking
affirmative
relief.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
no,
that
argument
would
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
--
would
not
apply
to
the
first
note
except
that
it
seems
to
me
this
may
be
akin
to
a
party
who
tries
to
especially
appear
in
an
action
and
then
when
it
gets
in
there,
asks
for
some
affirmative
relief.
but
when
it
gets
in
there,
it
subjects
itself
and
generally
to
all
of
the
rules
and
procedures
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that
is
right.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
that's
right.
that
is
my
argument.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
don't
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
can
separate
the
four
notes.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
once
they
get
into
the
courthouse
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
--
in
one
action,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
--
we
can
separate
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
then
i
would
be
forced
to
rely
on
some
of
the
other
arguments,
i
could
not
rely
on
--
on
this
initial
argument,
that
they
waived
that
--
that
condition
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
right.
if
it
had
filed
that
separate
suit,
it
would
clearly
have
been
subjected
to
the
rules
and
procedures
of
kansas.
the
fact
that
it
filed
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
with
reference
to
those
notes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
please
do.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
--
i
don't
know
that
i
can
answer
that
your
honor,
because
that
whole
thing
is
foreign
to
the
procedures
in
the
state
of
kansas.
there's
no
provision
for
redemption
from
a
landowner,
mortgagor
or
from
the
landowner-mortgagor
redeeming
from
somebody
who
has
in
turn
redeemed
during
the
first
12
months.
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
the
mortgagor
would
have
had
to
pay
the
entire
amount
that
was
sought
by
the
government
when
it
filed
its
cross
petition
and
the
lien
was
made.
that
was
for
some
$12,000
or
$14,000
as
i
recall,
all
four
notes
combined.
i
think
that
the
government
--
that
the
mortgagor
would
have
had
to
pay
that
entire
amount,
not
just
so
much
of
the
amount
as
related
to
the
piece
of
property
involved.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
the
way
this
took
place
in
accordance
with
the
prayer
of
the
government
in
the
district
court
of
edwards
county,
i
think
that's
right,
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
am
--
i'm
happy
that
we're
not
faced
with
that
particular
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
--
problem.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
will
you
--
will
you
repeat
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
--
those
your
honor?
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
my
argument
would
be,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
one
is
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
kansas
because
i
do
not
feel
that
you
can
split
this
thing
into
--
into
two
parts.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
the
government
was
there
asking
affirmative
relief.
i
don't
think
that
a
party,
be
it
the
government
or
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
those
three
notes
but
if
we
were
to
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
is
entitled
to
do
so
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
if
--
if
it
is
entitled
as
far
as
that
first
note,
i
think
it
can
waive
that
entitlement
by
its
action
once
it
gets
inside
the
courthouse.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
because
i
can't
grasp
the
concept
of
dividing
this
particular
foreclosure
action
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
then
the
argument
that
the
united
states
has
in
fact
made
i
think
would
--
would
more
clearly
be
before
this
court.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
did
get
what
it
asked
for.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
well
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
--
it
got
personal
judgments
against
the
hetzels
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
still
retained.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it
hasn't
lost
its
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
insofar
as
my
first
argument
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
--
is
concerned,
yes.
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
it's
all
one
piece
of
property.
it's
all
in
one
--
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
--
foreclosure
actually.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
but
when
they
assert
that
interest
and
seek
affirmative
relief,
all
in
one
foreclosure.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
(inaudible)
mr.
harry
l.
hobson
thank
you.
