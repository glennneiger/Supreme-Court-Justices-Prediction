justice
felix
frankfurter
regardless
of
what
(inaudible)
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
no
relation
to
the
property
of
the
(inaudible)
trying
to
have
its
redemption
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
seeking
the
redemptive
rights
on
the
basis
of
those
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
what
field
is
the
government
going
against
this
property
to
enforce
its
claim
against
three
unrelated
unsecured
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
if
the
lien,
as
i
thought,
that
the
lien
was
derived
from
the
adjudication
of
a
judgment
in
favor
of
the
united
states
on
its
claims
which
did
not
by
--
of
course
of
the
original
arrangement
operator's
lien.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
--
do
i
have
--
if
i
understand
you,
i
probably
don't,
but
i
understand
your
(inaudible)
covered
here
that
the
lien
which
is
served
on
which
that
they
said
claimed,
is
the
lien
came
into
being
not
through
an
arrangement
between
the
united
states
and
the
property
in
kansas
or
(inaudible)
but
to
an
adjudicatory
(inaudible)
of
kansas
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
really
a
controversy
to
what
--
what
the
applicable
facts
to
that
statute
is,
you
don't
challenge
the
validity
of
the
statutes
insofar
as
congress
has
asserted
power
of
--
of
giving
the
lienor
including
the
united
states'
claims
in
the
property
(inaudible)
of
sale,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
up
to
that
volume
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
haven't
challenged
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
fact
that
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
other
argument
that
had
such
weight
in
brosnan
namely
that
the
united
states
maintained
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
ask
this
question
before
you
sit
down?
suppose
when
it's
with
you
on
the
three
notes,
the
three
notes
by
which
the
affirmative
(inaudible)
suppose
one
is
with
you
of
those
three
notes,
(inaudible)
on
the
notes
--
on
the
notes
that
initially
had
with
it,
the
lien
for
the
government.
what
is
one
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
(inaudible)
with
reference
to
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
i'm
with
you
on
the
argument,
that
if
the
government
is
--
has
brought
a
separate
action
in
a
kansas
court,
where
enforced
it
--
on
those
three
notes
and
sought
a
lien
could
be
imposed
as
a
result
of
getting
an
adjudication
on
the
face
of
those
notes,
do
you
say
that
then
--
would
the
whole
--
the
whole
kansas
team
of
legislation
come
into
play
and
the
united
states
would
be
subject
to
--
to
burden
(inaudible)
of
any
other
litigant.
suppose
i'm
with
you
on
that.
suppose
as
to
the
first
note,
which
was
initially
(inaudible)
--
initially
operated
as
a
lien
on
the
property.
and
the
united
states
came
in
because
under
kansas
law,
it
has
to
be
brought
in,
in
order
to
adjudicate
the
rights
that
a
mortgagor-mortgagee
and
is
therefore,
you
can't
make
the
argument
that
united
states
was
subject
to
kansas
law
as
a
litigant.
it's
an
enforced
litigant
who
is
not
subject
to
extend
on
its
construction
of
the
priority
on
--
of
the
redemptive
right
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what
would
you
do
if
you
couldn't
find
yourself
in
that
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ask
affirmative
relief
with
reference
to
those
three
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
entitled
--
and
it's
entitled
to
be
protected
as
to
the
first
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
why
does
it
waive
if
what
is
entitled
under
the
first
note
because
it
makes
new
independent
claims
as
the
three
notes
before
--
in
a
different
status
than
the
first
note
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
is
that
--
suppose
it
has
intended
the
claim
on
those
three
notes,
what
was
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
tell
me
how
that
argument
would
evaporate
because
it
has
the
assumption
it
couldn't
get.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
didn't.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
redemptive
rights
under
the
first
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
certainly
got
the
right
that
it's
been
stand
on
and
would
have
had
if
it
had
been
brought
the
count
of
these
independent
(inaudible)
on
the
three
new
notes,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
does
this
follow
that
you
have
--
that
you
must
have
the
same
right
on
--
on
the
position
claimed?
i
don't
understand
that.
even
those
rights
to
property
(inaudible)
and
they
have
none
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
all
they
got
nothing,
was
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
had
liens
on
the
mortgaged
premises
on
those
three
notes?
they
didn't
have
them
under
--
the
kansas
court
gave
it
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
--
i
don't
understand
why
you
called
it
a
refinement
whether
you
have
a
lien
or
you
haven't.
that's
a
pretty
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
with
my
mind
that
--
that
i
don't
see
it
that
way.
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
were
pulled
in
on
a
note
which
gave
you
a
lien
but
you
had
three
other
notes
which
didn't
give
you
(inaudible)
and
therefore
you
entered
the
court,
you
have
a
lien
derived
from
the
notes.
now,
you
may
say
these
are
wrong
about
that.
this
will
be
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they're
wrong
about
it,
and
it
isn't
a
refinement,
if
you
had
a
lien
to
start
with
and
you
had
no
lien
to
start
with,
that
is
a
refinement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
on
which
you
were
brought
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
one
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
and
that
confirms
mr.
hobson,
you
don't
think
that
we
agree
with
him,
that
you
had
only
one
more
with
the
notes
on
the
three
non-mortgage
notes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
mortgage
notes
which
justice
brennan
just
dictated,
you
had
to
come
in
under
kansas
law.
but
on
the
three
non-mortgage
notes,
there
were
no
compulsion
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
can't
do
that
in
the
abstract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
knows
that
better
than
you.
