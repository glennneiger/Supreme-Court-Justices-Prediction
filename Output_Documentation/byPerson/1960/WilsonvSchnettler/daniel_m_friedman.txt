mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
argue
basically
two
propositions.
first,
which
i
will
come
to
second
but
we
don't
think
that
the
rea
case
should
be
extended
to
this
kind
of
a
situation
but
we
don't
think
the
court
has
to
reach
that
broad
proposition
because
we
think
that
the
district
court
was
fully
warranted
on
the
basis
of
what
is
shown
by
this
record
in
refusing
to
re-adjudicate
as
petitioner's
counsel
has
conceded
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
search
and
seizure
that
petitioner
had
previously
sought
a
ruling
from
--
in
the
state
court.
and
the
state
court
had
argued,
objected
his
contention.
this
case
on
its
face
is
almost
the
converse
of
the
rea
case.
and
the
rea
case
what
happened
was,
the
federal
court
initially
had
suppressed
the
evidence
and
then
after
the
federal
court
had
suppressed
the
evidence,
the
federal
narcotics
agent
went
over
in
to
the
state
court
and
filed
a
state
complaint
and
instituted
a
state
criminal
proceeding
based
on
the
same
state
of
facts.
now,
on
this
case,
there's
been
no
proceeding
at
all
in
the
federal
court.
this
man
was
arrested
by
the
federal
narcotics
agent
and
it's
been
suggested
here
that
there
was
something
improper
because
they
arrested
him
without
a
warrant.
well,
the
statute
specifically
authorizes
federal
narcotics
agents
to
arrest
without
a
warrant
when
they
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
man
arrested
is
committing
a
crime.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
wanted
a
hearing
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
but
that
is
the
issue
which
they
have
previously
litigated
in
the
state
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
has
been
a
hearing
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
there
has
not
been
a
hearing
in
terms
of
whether
rule
41
(e)
has
been
complied.
there
has,
however,
been
a
hearing
before
the
state
court
on
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
this
petitioner.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
if
the
state
of
illinois
is
a
state
which
not
only
follows
the
so-called
exclusionary
rule
that
excludes
evidence,
obtain
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
but
furthermore,
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
stated
that
in
applying
the
provisions
of
the
illinois'
constitutional
prohibition
on
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures,
substantially
the
same
standard
that
this
court
has
enunciated
under
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
applied
in
applying
that
state
standard.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
not
decided
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
not
--
let
me
say
this
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
there's
one
case,
only
one
case
that
discusses
this
issue.
this
is
the
people
against
tully
in
illinois.
in
that
case,
the
court
refused
to
suppress
evidence
that
had
been
seized
by
an
officer
of
another
state.
but
there
is
dictum
in
the
case
which
seemingly
suggests
that
it
would
suppress
it
if
it
was
the
result
of
a
seizure
either
by
officers
of
illinois
or
by
federal
officers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
i
have
to
say
clearly
so
mr.
justice
if
i
may
without
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
yes,
but
they
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
the
trial
courts
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
believing
that
this
man
had
committed
a
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
the
merits
of
the
seizure
and
the
court
stated
he
believe
this
case
was
controlled
by
the
draper
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
there
is
nothing
so
to
indicate.
the
--
the
decision
of
the
--
the
action
in
this
case
in
the
state
court,
it
was
treated
without
regard
to
who
made
the
seizure,
it
was
treated
in
terms
of
was
there
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
of
this
man.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
are
very
frequent
and
they
have
a
number
of
cases
i
might
mention
in
which
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
reversed
criminal
convictions
because
the
arrest
without
a
warrant
was
not
based
on
probable
cause.
so
that
even
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument,
even
let
us
assume
that
the
action
of
the
trial
court
of
illinois
in
this
case
was
an
error
that
it
should've
been
suppressed,
there
will
be
full
opportunity
if
petitioner
should
be
convicted
for
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
correct
that
on
its
appeal,
on
any
appeal
that
it
takes
in
view
of
the
consistent
holdings
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
that
evidence
obtained
as
a
result
of
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
will
not
be
allowed
to
support
a
conviction,
it
must
be
assumed
that
if
in
fact
there
wasn't
any
reasonable
basis
for
this
search
and
seizure.
the
illinois
supreme
court
will
reverse
any
condition
that
maybe
had.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
your
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
they're
not
really
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
are
you
--
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
you're
referring
to
page
8
of
the
record?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
this
--
the
page
8
of
the
record
is
the
petitioner's
statement
as
to
what
the
evidence
showed
before
the
illinois
trial
court
and
petitioners
do
not
petition
that
it
does
not
contend
that
no
states
that
this
is
all
the
evidence.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
it's
been
agreed
that
the
court
may
consider
this
transcript
of
the
proceedings
before
the
illinois
trial
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
because
at
that
point,
they
have
not
been
before
the
trial
court
in
this
case.
i
may
say
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
more
evidence
than
is
summarized
in
this
material
on
page
8.
we
think
there's
much
more
than
suspicion
here,
this
is
based
on
a
reliable
informant,
the
fact
that
he
was
told
that
the
man
was
purchasing
narcotics
at
this
odd
time
that
he
was
told
that
this
man
and
his
brother
were
purchasing
narcotics
that
the
agent
himself
had
seen
the
brother
purchase
of
it.
there
is,
we
believe,
the
court
upon
examination
of
this
transcript,
it
will
show
that
this
we
really
think
does
clearly
come
within
this
court's
draper
holding
that
there
was
probable
cause
in
this
case.
but
my
point
is
that
in
any
event
since
the
petitioner
has
litigated
this
question
in
the
state
court
and
the
state
court
has
ruled
against
him,
we
think
the
federal
court
was
fully
warranted
in
these
circumstances
in
declining
immediately
thereafter
to
review
that
decision
through
the
medium
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
now,
of
course
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out
that
the
declaratory
judgment
section
vest
great
discretion
in
the
trial
court
even
though
a
matter
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court,
the
court
is
not
required
to
give
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
court
has
indicated
that
a
declaratory
judgment
should
be
given
only
in
those
situations
where
really
there
is
no
other
available
remedy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
--
i
would
say
yes
if
he
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
shouldn't
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
like
to
distinguish
really
because
we
think
that
the
general
supervisory
authority
over
federal
officers
which
this
court
refers
to
and
based
its
decision
in
rea
and
which
petitioner
here
invokes,
we
think
does
not
entail
any
general
authority
in
the
federal
courts
to
supervise
federal
officers.
we
think
that
the
basic
rationale
of
rea;
the
reason
why
in
rea
this
court
deemed
it
appropriate
to
invoke
its
supervisory
jurisdiction
over
federal
officials
was
because
that
case
involved
a
misuse
of
the
court's
own
process.
in
that
case,
a
warrant
had
been
issued
by
united
states
commissioner
who
is
an
officer
of
the
district
court.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
three
times
during
the
course
of
the
opinion
in
the
rea
case,
the
court
emphasizes
the
fact
of
the
abusive
process
that
was
involved
and
states
at
one
point
that
he
had
the
relief
he's
asked
against
the
federal
agent
who
obtained
the
property
as
a
result
of
the
abuse
of
process
issued
by
a
united
states
commissioner.
and
then
later
on,
federal
courts
seek
to
enforce
federal
law
and
federal
law
extends
to
the
process
issuing
from
those
courts.
and
the
court
also
quoted
a
statement
from
wise
against
henkel
which
speaks
of
the
exertion
of
the
authority
of
the
district
court
in
connection
with
the
execution
of
the
process
of
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice,
once
the
man
is
arrested,
once
the
man
has
been
arrested
by
federal
officials
at
that
point
under
the
rules
he
can
go
in
to
the
federal
district
court
and
move
to
suppress.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
had
been
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
mr.
justice,
the
federal
officials
immediately
turned
him
over
to
the
state
prosecution
and
since
there
was
no
other
connection
of
the
federal
courts
with
this
matter,
there
was
no
federal
order,
there
was
no
federal
process
involved,
we
think
at
that
point
this
was
a
matter
for
the
state.
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
that
issue
was
posed
by
this
case
because
i
don't
think
here
although
there
were
allegations
that
he
was
taken
over
to
the
state
court,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
usual
policy
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics
is
to
cooperate
and
to
transfer
a
lot
of
minor
offenders
over
to
the
state
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
duty
is
to
take
him
before
a
commissioner
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
if
he
is
--
but
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
he
didn't
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
i
may
answer
that
in
two
ways,
two
ways
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
first,
i
think
that
that
provision
on
arraigning
him
promptly
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
provision
of
the
statute
authorizing
the
cooperation
in
returning
him
over.
i
think
that
is
in
contemplation
whether
as
a
prospective
federal
criminal
prosecution
but
where
he
is
arrested
and
immediately
turned
over,
i
think
it's
a
different
situation
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
don't
say
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
avoid
it
basically
because
i
think
that
even
assuming
in
this
case
even
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
agent's
refusal,
failure
to
arraign
this
man
were
violation
of
the
rules.
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
would
not
concede
that
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
i
think
these
rules,
these
rules
are
written
in
the
contemplation
of
the
procedures
of
the
federal
courts
and
there
was
here
no
procedure
involved
in
the
federal
courts.
all
that
we
had
here
was
--
these
are
the
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure
which
is
stated
to
government
proceedings
in
the
federal
courts
and
there
was
here
no
federal
court
procedure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
without
--
without
on
due
delay
and
no
attempt
to
evade
i
have
to
add
this
quote
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
--
there's
no
proof
and
there's
--
there's
nothing
but
the
naked
allegation
that
there
was
an
attempt
to
turn
him
over
to
avoid
the
harsher
and
stricter
rules
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
they're
not
entitled
to
a
hearing
here
because
first,
this
very
issue
has
already
been
litigated
in
the
state
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
they
cannot.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
my
understanding
that
he's
based
--
his
motion
to
suppress
was
not
based
on
the
failure
to
arraign
but
rather
on
the
failure
to
have
any
reasonable
grounds
for
the
search
and
seizure.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i
would
like
to
suggest
this,
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
reason
in
this
case,
the
federal
courts
should
not
be
open
to
litigate
these
issues,
is
because
the
power
and
the
interest
of
the
federal
courts
in
enforcing
compliance
with
the
federal
rules
is
basically
a
power
and
an
interest
to
supervise
federal
officers
insofar
as
their
conduct
involves
the
federal
courts
themselves.
we
--
we
don't
think
there's
a
basic
supervisory
authority,
a
basic
policing
function
in
the
federal
courts
to
police
federal
agents
except
insofar
as
there
are
some
way,
some
--
some
involvement
with
the
process
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
attaches
in
that
if
there
has
been
nothing
else
done,
the
man
can
promptly
move
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
i
think
that
that
situation,
the
reason
in
that
situation,
the
motion
to
suppress
is
entertained
because
this
is
in
effect
in
contemplation
of
a
possible
federal
prosecution.
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
he
clearly
could
be
prosecuted
but
the
policy
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
federally
i
would
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
never
been
arraigned
but
he
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
suppose
we
could
rearrest.
thank
you,
mr.
justice.[laughter]
i'd
like
to
emphasize
mr.
chief
justice
that
--
and
members
of
the
court,
but
to
mr.
chief
justice
particularly
since
he's
been
pressing
me
on
this
that
the
real
situation,
the
invocation
of
the
powers
of
the
federal
courts
to
police
officers,
federal
enforcement
officers
and
their
compliance
with
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
we
think
it's
basically
designed
to
ensure
the
appropriate
conduct
of
federal
criminal
trials.
now,
in
the
rea
case,
this
court
in
invoking
of
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
federal
courts
relied
on
the
mcnabb
decision
and
we
think
the
mcnabb
decision
was
very
explicit
that
the
rule
of
supervision
there
announced
was
intended
to
relate
only
to
the
federal
courts.
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
he
could
be
--
he
could
be
rearrested.
they
might
in
that
case
have
to
get
a
warrant.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
when
you
originally
asked
your
question,
i
suspected
you
are
raising
the
problem
of
constitutional
power
where
there'd
be
any
double
jeopardy
to
this
prosecution.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
drop
prosecution.
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
he
could
--
i
think
he
could
certainly
be
indicted.
he
might
move
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
i
don't
know
what
the
effect
of
the
non-arraignment
in
this
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
it
might
be
if
in
effect
the
federal
government
dropped
the
whole
case
and
started
a
new
case.
i
would
like
to
refer
briefly
to
what
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
there's
--
mr.
justice,
at
the
moment,
this
case
has
been
turned
over
to
the
state,
the
state
prosecution
is
now
pending
and
we
think
that
absent
to
any
connection
with
the
federal
courts
that
the
federal
court
should
not
attempt
to
control
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
in
the
state
courts
that
--
i'd
like
if
i
may
read
to
the
court
two
sentences
from
the
conclusion
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
mcnabb
case
and
reversing
that
conviction
there
because
of
the
improper
introduction
of
the
evidence
acting
under
its
supervisory
powers,
the
court
said
in
so
doing.
we
confine
ourselves
to
our
limited
function
as
the
court
have
ultimate
review
of
the
standards
formulated
and
applied
by
federal
courts
in
the
trial
of
criminal
cases.
we
are
not
concern
with
law
enforcement
practices
except
insofar
as
courts
themselves
become
instruments
of
law
enforcement
and
i
think
when
they
speak
of
the
court,
this
court
was
clearly
speaking
of
the
federal
courts.
in
other
words,
it's
not
concerned
with
generally
policing
the
activities
of
federal
law
enforcement
agents
except
insofar
as
the
courts
themselves
become
instruments
of
law
enforcement.
the
mcnabb
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
not
because
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
did
not
and
have
been
dismissed
by
the
government.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
finished
with
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
i
think
mr.
justice
in
that
case
there
was
an
abuse
of
the
court's
process.
the
basic
manner
by
which
the
evidence
had
been
obtained
was
a
misuse
of
the
court's
process.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
was
laid
on
the
supervisory
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
a
criminal
proceeding
in
the
federal
courts
or
a
proceeding
in
which
the
process
of
the
federal
court
is
involved.
because
the
court,
three
times,
i
repeat
speaks
in
terms
of
the
process,
process
of
the
federal
court
that
is
what
is
involved
in
the
case.
now,
i
think
what
the
petitioner
is
doing
here
is
attempting
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
rea.
i
think
petitioner
is
attempting
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
rea
to
reach
a
situation
where
the
federal
courts
otherwise
have
no
connection
at
all
with
the
alleged
violation
of
the
federal
rule.
and
the
petitioner
suggest
that
whenever
there's
an
allegation
that
a
federal
law
enforcement
official
has
violated
the
federal
rules,
that
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
entitle
him
to
go
into
the
federal
court
and
to
get
that
matter
adjudicated
even
though
the
federal
courts
have
no
connection
with
the
case
and
further
even
though
it
is
the
state
and
not
the
federal
courts
which
in
the
final
analysis
must
decide
whether
to
admit
that
evidence.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
doesn't
say
that
in
so
many
words.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it
does
come
very
close
to
that,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
it
speaks
about
cooperation
in
the
institution
and
prosecution
of
cases
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
before
the
licensing
boards
and
before
courts
of
the
several
states.
so
it
contemplates
cooperation
between
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
his
officials
and
the
states
for
the
institution
and
prosecution
of
cases
before
the
courts
of
the
several
states.
now,
the
practice,
and
i
say
the
practice
in
the
narcotics
bureau
is
in
the
case
of
minor
offense
where
there
is
either
a
peddler,
minor
peddler
or
no
interstate
aspects
to
turn
these
cases
over
to
the
state
courts
for
prosecution.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
i
have
mr.
chief
justice
in
figures.
i
obtained
some
data
on
the
extent
and
for
the
year
1959,
there
were
a
total
of
1,725
federal
narcotics
cases
brought
and
of
those
cases
that
brought
in
which
the
federal
government
had
made
the
arrest
and
developed
the
case.
and
of
those
1,725
cases
only
1,268
were
prosecuted
in
the
federal
courts
and
457
were
turned
over
to
the
states
for
prosecution.
in
other
words,
roughly,
a
quarter
of
all
the
federal
narcotics
cases
developed
were
turned
over
to
the
state.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
cannot.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
all
i
can
say
is
that,
you
say
avoided
him
--
avoided
taking
him
in
to
the
federal
courts.
i
think
the
practice
is,
i
have
to
repeat
this,
the
practice
is
that
in
minor
cases
at
which
we
believe
this
is
when
the
man
is
directly
turned
over
to
the
state
officials
and
we
think
that
this
is
what
is
contemplated
by
the
statute.
i'm
not
--
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
illinois
statute
provides
lesser
penalties
for
narcotics
violation
in
the
federal
statute.
the
minimum
penalties
and
the
maximum
penalties
are
less.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
touch
on
one
matter
in
closing
which
is
the,
the
reason
why
we
urge
that
where
there
has
been
no
connection
by
the
federal
courts
with
the
activities
of
the
federal
law
enforcement
officers
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
attempt
to
control
the
federal
officers
insofar
as
the
attempt
introduced
the
evidence
in
the
state
court,
and
that
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
very
delicate
area.
this
area
of
interference
by
federal
courts
in
the
trial
of
state
criminal
cases
as
this
court
described
it
in
stefanelli
case,
they
said
this
touches
perhaps
the
most
sensitive
source
of
friction
between
states
and
nation,
namely,
the
active
intrusion
of
the
federal
courts
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
to
the
prosecution
of
crimes
solely
within
the
power
of
the
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
agree
mr.
chief
justice.
if
they
did
that,
there
wouldn't
be
that
problem
but
there
would
still
be
the
problem,
the
basic
problem
of
the
basic
argument
which
is
made
hereby
the
petitioner
is
not
that
he
wasn't
arraigned
but
that
that
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
search
and
seizure.
and
as
far
as
the
lack
of
arraignment
is
concerned,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
it
seems
to
me
does
not
touch
on
the
question
of
whether
this
evidence
should
be
presented
to
the
state
courts.
i
think
there
are
other
remedies
available
that
this
man's
rights
have
been
violated
but
we're
dealing
here
in
an
area
where
although
the
order
which
petitioner
seeks
is
not
in
terms
in
joining
the
conduct
of
the
state
proceeding,
the
inevitable
effect
of
such
an
order
if
it
were
granted
would
be
that
the
state
prosecution
to
all
intents
and
purposes
would
be
stultify
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
he
--
mr.
chief
justice,
he
is
not
being
prosecuted
by
the
federal
courts
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
was
being
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
may
have
had
power
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
to
whether
the
court
should
exercise
it
in
the
circumstances
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
a
different
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
think
on
the
basis
of
these
considerations,
the
importance
of
preserving
the
federal
and
state
system
the
fact
that
under
the
constitution
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
state,
if
it
sees
fit,
may
even
accept
evidence
which
has
been
obtained
as
the
result
of
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
there
was,
as
i
mentioned,
illinois
does
not
follow
that
policy
in
view
of
the
fact
that
here,
there
was
no
connection
between
the
federal
court
and
the
alleged
illegal
activities
of
the
federal
officers.
in
this
case,
it
would
be
most
inappropriate
for
the
federal
court
to
trench
from
this
sensitive
area
and
enjoin
the
introduction
of
evidence
from
the
state
to
see.
thank
you.
