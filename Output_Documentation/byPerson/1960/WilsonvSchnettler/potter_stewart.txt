do
we
have
here
any
record
of
those
state
court
proceedings?
justice
potter
stewart
can
you
tell
me
this
much
about
the
state
court
proceedings,
was
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
denied
because
it
was
not
an
unlawful

or
because
this
had
been
done
purely
by
federal
officers
or

federal
officers?

unlawfully

be
suppressed

the
seizure

justice
potter

we'll
read
that
on
the
time.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
is
your
understanding?
justice
potter
stewart
decision
was
made
on
the
merits
of
the
seizure.
justice
potter
stewart
presumably
they
held
it
was
a

arrest,
therefore,
lawful
search
and
