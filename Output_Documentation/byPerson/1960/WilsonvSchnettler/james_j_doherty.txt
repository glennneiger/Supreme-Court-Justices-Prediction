mr.
james
j.
doherty
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
i'll
try
to
make
this
short
as
possible
in
the
presentation.
may
it
please
your
honors.
this
case
involves
the
supervisory
power
of
federal
courts
over
federal
law
enforcement
officers.
the
respondents,
federal
narcotics
agents,
arrested
the
petitioner
on
april
14,
1959
at
about
7:30
in
the
morning
and
they
searched
him
without
a
warrant
and
they
recovered
two
packages
of
narcotics
from
his
purse.
they
did
not
take
him
before
the
united
states
commissioner
but
they
took
him
and
lodged
him
in
the
cook
county
jail,
located
at
chicago,
illinois.
thereafter,
in
the
month
of
july
he
was
indicted
by
the
grand
jury
of
cook
county
and
charged
with
the
crime
of
unlawful
possession
of
narcotic
drugs.
on
july
31st,
he
was
arraigned
at
which
time
our
office
was
appointed
to
defend
him
because
he
was
in
fact
an
indigent
prisoner.
he
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
the
state
court
and
the
motion
was
denied.
whereupon,
thereafter,
we
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
we
have
not
--
not
as
a
part
of
this
record,
your
honor,
however,
we
have
a
copy,
a
transcript
of
the
copy
and
the
solicitor
general
has
a
transcript,
i
know
because
the
court
reporter
either
lost
her
notes
or
something
but
she
copied
mine
to
give
it
to
them
so
we'll
stipulate
to
the
conduit
of
the
record
if
they
want
to
after
this.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
now
the
--
we
went
over
to
the
federal
district
court
and
we
made
a
petition
for
declaratory
judgment.
we
asked
the
district
court
to
hold
the
hearing
and
to
ascertain
in
that
hearing
if
these
federal
agents
had
obeyed
the
standards
imposed
upon
them
by
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
--
the
state
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
and
they
said
that
the
authority
for
doing
so
was
the
case
of
draper
versus
united
states,
ruled
on
the
merits.
during
that
time,
we
tried
to
inquire
into
why
that
he
was
not
taken
before
the
united
states
commissioner.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
it
was
an
arrest
case.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
facts
precisely
as
are
in
the
transcript
of
record
are
that
they
had
a
building
under
surveillance
where
they
had
information
that
narcotics
were
being
sold.
and
they
had
information
that
this
man
had
in
the
past
bought
narcotics
on
two
or
three
occasions
and
he
did
it
between
7:00
and
8:00
in
the
morning
and
that
was
the
information
they
had.
further
brought
out
if
i
may
speak
about
what
is
in
this
transcript
now
with
propriety,
they
testified
further
that
they
did
not
know
that
a
crime
was
in
fact
committed
in
that
building.
they
had
received
no
signal
from
anybody
that
a
crime
had
in
fact
been
committed
in
that
building
that
morning.
and
they
could
not
testify
under
oath
whether
he
had
the
narcotics
on
him
before
he
went
in
or
not.
now,
we
feel
your
honors
that
the
sole
issue
here
is,
are
we
entitled
to
go
before
a
district
court
and
are
we
entitled
to
a
hearing,
not
the
merits
of
it,
we
never
have
been
presumptions
enough
to
say
that
we
know
we're
right,
we
think
we're
right
and
we
think
that
sincerely,
we
think
that
we
are
right
that
this
case
will
be
thrown
out
in
a
federal
district
court
on
a
hearing
by
the
district
judge.
now,
the
--
the
issue
here
is,
are
we
entitled
to
that
hearing?
your
honors
granted
certiorari
on
the
case
as
it
came
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
he
hasn't,
your
honor.
at
this
moment
he
is
presumed
to
be
innocent
to
this
charge
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
--
and
his
awaiting
trial.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
now,
as
i
say
the
case
was
dismissed
in
the
district
court
and
it
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
form
of
conference
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
the
dismissal
and
i
think
in
examination
of
the
decision
will
reveal
that
they
assigned
two
reasons
for
affirming
this
case
and
you'll
find
this
at
the
bottom
of
record,
page
15.
they
said
first,
“this
case
must
be
distinguished
from
rea
versus
united
states.”
which
your
honors
set
forth
in
350
u.s.
they
said
here,
“they
were
not
acting
under
color
of
federal
judicial
authority.”
the
federal
narcotic
agents
and
therefore,
the
supervisory
power
cannot
intrude
to
restrain
their
testimony
in
a
state
trial.
and
we
say
that
that
is
an
invitation
to
these
federal
agents
not
to
go
near
to
the
united
states
commissioner
and
not
to
seek
the
protection
of
a
warrant.
it
tells
them
in
our
humble
opinion
as
clear
as
words
can
be
that
if
you
go
and
you'll
get
a
warrant
we
can
question
you,
we
can
ask
about
the
acts
surrounding
the
arrest,
we
can
question
the
warrant,
and
then
we
can
suppress
this
evidence
and
if
you
want
to
insulate
yourself
against
this
then
just
stay
away
from
the
united
states
commissioner.
don't
go
near
him,
because
if
you
don't
go
near
them
then
we
can't
touch
you,
we
can't
inquire
at
all.
that's
what
it
tells.
therefore,
we
say
that's
an
erroneous
reason.
the
other
reason
is
they
say
that
the
admission
of
these
narcotics
has
not
been
sought
in
the
federal
court.
now,
your
honors
have
told
us
in
--
in
the
rea
case,
that
it's
the
duty
of
the
federal
agent
to
obey
the
rules.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
think
the
court
was
speaking
about
all
of
the
rules.
the
--
the
federal
rules
or
criminal
procedure
your
honor
and
especially
in
this
case
the
rules
governing
search
and
seizure
and
rule
5
(a).
now,
this
allows
the
federal
agents
to
just
stop
and
analyze
and
talk
over
what
they
have
done
by
way
of
making
an
arrest.
and
if
they're
satisfied
in
their
own
minds
that
they
have
obeyed
the
rules
then
they
proceed
to
prosecute
in
the
district
court
but
if
they
haven't
obeyed
the
rules
then
they
go
into
the
state
court
where
you
can't
inquire
under
the
transgressions
that
they
have
committed.
and
incidentally,
you'll
find
in
this
transcript
that
we
tried
to
inquire
into
why.
why
wasn't
this
man
brought
before
united
states
commissioner
and
we
were
stopped?
we
weren't
allowed
to
ask
that
question.
now,
those
are
the
two
reasons
that
i
can
find
in
this
--
mr.
james
j.
doherty
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
(voice
overlap)
i
think
it's
on
page
16.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
alright.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
don't
take
the
time,
alright.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
but
he
just
said
“i'll
see
what
difference
that
makes?”
i
think
those
were
his
words
and
he
wouldn't
allow
it
to
be
inquired
into
--
in
the
state
court.
now,
as
on
a
side,
the
court
said,
“if
this
power
existed,
the
supervisory
power,
there
are
policy
considerations
against
it.”
and
they
talked
about
title
21
u.s.c.
198
(a)
which
adjures
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
cooperate
with
the
several
states.
now,
i
would
like
to
set
that
aside
just
for
a
second
and
talk
about
it
about
two
or
three
minutes
from
now.
he
said
also
that
in
effect,
“if
you
were
to
be
given
this
relief
that
you
seek
now,
in
effect
it
would
be
granting
you
immediate
federal
review
of
an
interlocutory
state
order.”
and
i
think
candor
requires
us
to
admit
that
that
is
true,
that
would
be
the
effect
but
we
submit
that
we
are
not
here
dealing
in
effects.
we
submit
that
we
are
dealing
here
in
pervading
principles
in
underlying
philosophy.
we're
talking
here
--
we're
trying
to
--
we're
seeking
to
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
predicated
upon
the
supervisory
power
which
as
late
as
june
1960.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
called
a
peculiarly
comprehensive
power
and
designed
to
discipline
federal
officers
so
that
we
asked,
“is
it
designed
to
discipline
federal
officers
and
when
they
--
when
they
come
under
the
federal
court
or
can
they
avoid
it,
can
they
actually
avoid
it
by
not
going
near
the
federal
court
and
going
into
a
state
court
instead?”
now,
the
--
the
government
doesn't
discuss
the
two
reasons
that
the
court
of
appeals
talked
about
not
going
into
federal
court,
enacting
under
federal
--
color
of
federal
authority.
they
say
that
we
are
bound
by
the
state
order
on
what
appears
to
me
to
be
a
principle
of
res
judicata.
and
yet,
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
recall
that
in
the
--
in
the
rea
case,
the
court
said
that
the
command
of
the
federal
rules
is
not
affected
by
anything
that
takes
place
in
a
state
court.
that's
what
mr.
justice
douglas
said
and
as
late
as
the
elkins
case,
mr.
justice
stewart
said
that
when
you're
asking
--
when
you
were
trying
to
find
out
that
there
was
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
by
state
officers
that
that
is
an
independent
inquiry,
it's
a
question
of
federal
law
and
so
that
the
district
court
has
to
hold
a
hearing
and
it
has
to
decide.
it
says,
neither
large
by
one
state
court
may
have
countless
nor
diminished
by
what
another
may
have
colorably
suppress.
now,
if
that's
true
about
state
officers
whom
--
over
whom
you
have
no
control
for
all
intents
and
purposes
except
when
they
come
in
to
a
federal
court.
if
that's
true
about
them,
how
much
more
is
it
true
about
federal
officers
over
whom
this
court
has
traditionally
exercises
this
discipline,
this
federal
supervisory
power?
and
they
say
also
that
we
haven't
alleged
sufficient
to
show
misconduct
predicated
upon
the
draper
case
and
of
course
we
stipulated
this
thing
into
evidence
now.
so,
i
think
that
covers
it.
it's
--
it
was
a
question
of
trying
to
boil
down
the
39-page
document
into
a
couple
of
paragraphs
to
get
before
the
court
but
it's
immaterial
because
what
we
want
is
the
hearing.
that's
all
that
we
ask.
we
--
we
believe
that
we
are
being
conscientious
when
we
say
--
when
we
discovered
to
the
state
court
what
happened,
we
believe
we
are
being
conscientious
when
we
honestly
believe
that
we'll
prevail
this
in
--
in
the
district
court
and
that
the
district
court
will
throw
it
out
but
we
can't
be
presumptuous
enough
to
say
that
we
know.
now,
in
rea,
there's
the
difference.
in
the
rea
case,
the
man
who
went
into
the
district
court
and
i
remind
you
at
that
time
there
was
nothing
pending
in
the
district
court
when
he
went
back
and
he
saw
his
injunction
he
knew
that
the
man
he
was
going
before
had
already
said,
“this
is
wrong.
he
violated
the
federal
rules.you
got
to
throw
it
out.”
now,
this
is
in
the
side,
but
i
wonder
if
this
section
198
(a)
of
title
21
really
means
and
it's
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
the
first
one,
now,
does
that
mean
that
they
can
violate
rule
5
(a)?
is
rule
5
(a)
an
invitation
to
the
federal
agents
which
says,
“no,
no,
please
take
this
fellow
before
united
states
commissioner
if
you
feel
like
it.”
or
is
it
a
mandate
that
issues
from
the
court,
from
this
court
which
actually
formulated
the
rules
so
that
perhaps,
by
virtue
of
rule
5
(a)
you
can't
very
well
say
that
this
was
meant
to
supplant
it
and
nobody
mentions
the
fact
and
we
said
it
out
in
a
separate
paragraph
in
our
statement
of
facts
that
this
man
wasn't
taken
before
the
united
states
commissioner.
now,
that
won't
appear
in
the
record
because
they
stopped
us
when
we
went
to
inquire
about
it
here.so
propriety
dictates
that
i
not
talk
about
that
off
the
record.
now,
we
say
this
that
the
rea
case
certainly
doesn't
control
this
case.
the
rea
case
--
if
it's
limited
to
the
proposition
for
which
it
stands
means
just
what
it
says
we
are
going
and
you
get
a
search
warrant
and
the
judge
already
rules
that
it's
a
violation
and
then
they
try
to
go
that
they
can
be
enjoined.
we
do
say
this
that
we
should
prevail
here
under
the
rationale
of
the
rea
case.under
this
peculiarly
comprehensive
supervisory
power,
we
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
in
the
stefanelli
versus
minard,
the
court
was
asked
to
grant
equitable
relief
to
prevent
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
search
by
new
jersey
police
being
introduced
in
a
state
trial.
now,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
stay
--
state
proceedings
at
all.
every
single
case
they
cite
if
--
where
somebody
invoked
the
general
equity
power
and
this
is
not
the
power
we're
talking
about,
we're
talking
about
the
supervisory
power.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
if
we
got
it?
the
effect
would
be
to
make
impossible
the
--
the
progress
of
the
state
criminal
prosecution
(voice
overlap)
that
it
would
be
an
incidental
effect
we
respectfully
submit.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
well,
in
the
event
that
we
get
the
relief
we're
seeking
from
the
district
court
or
this
court
on
the
ruling
on
the
merits
predicated
upon
the
stipulation
of
the
document.
we
say
this
to
you;
the
effect
would
be
to
destroy
the
state
prosecution
just
exactly
as
it
was
in
the
rea
case
where
they
couldn't
proceed
without
the
testimony
of
the
federal
agents.
mr.
james
j.
doherty
the
individual
said
a
real
agent
who
owes
obedience
to
your
rules.
that's
all
that
we
say.
and
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
should
not
be
subject
to
the
whim
of
a
state
trial
court.
people
versus
la
bostrie
cited
by
the
government
in
their
case
all
i
say
is
read
it
and
if
that
doesn't
fit
within
the
category
of
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
then
i
will
be
astounded.
now,
the
mcnabb
doctrine
was
for
the
public
records
specifically
rejected
in
the
people
versus
hall
at
413
illinois.
now,
we
don't
know
what
a
minor
offender
is,
they
say
the
state
law
is
less
severe.
state
law
provides
2
to
10
years
in
the
penitentiary
for
the
first
offense
and
five
until
life
for
the
second
offense
and
those
--
those
aren't
minor
that's
for
possession.
so
we're
not
talking
about
small
things.
i
thank
you
very
much
for
--
are
there
any
questions?
thank
you
very
much.
