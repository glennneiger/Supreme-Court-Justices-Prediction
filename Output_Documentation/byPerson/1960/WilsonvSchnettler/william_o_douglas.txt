william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
what
they
want
a
hearing
on
it
as
i
gather.
justice
william
o.
douglas
whether
what
you
say
is
true.
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
there
been
a
hearing
on
--
in
the
state
court
on
the
--
whether
the
rule
41
(e)
has
been
complied
with?
justice
william
o.
douglas
those
rules
certainly
are
--
aren't
finding
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
these
findings
are
--
are
rather
short
from
the
brief
that
the
state
court
made.
justice
william
o.
douglas
these
findings
that
the
state
court
made
are
rather
short
from
the
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they're
on
page
8
and
you
say
that
they
applied
the
federal
standards
but
it's
very
difficult
--
needs
--
to
see
what
standard
they
apply?
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
this
man
was
suspected
of
anything,
it
just
happened
to
come
out
of
the
building
that
was
being
watched.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
is
the
evidence
and
you
--
i
just
go
--
i'm
referring
to
citations
in
your
brief
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
and
it
takes
me
to
--
to
this.
justice
william
o.
douglas
they're
not
cited
in
your
brief.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
suppose
then
you
had
said
that
if
he
got
to
the
federal
court
first,
he
then
would
have
been
out
because
he
should
have
gone
with
the
state
court.
he
goes
to
the
state
court
first
and
he's
out
because
he
had
a
finding.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
--
that
of
course
would
answer
rea
too.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
he
could've
contested
that
in
the
state.
