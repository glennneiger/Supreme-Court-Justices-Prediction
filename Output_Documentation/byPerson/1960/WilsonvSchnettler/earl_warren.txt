bernard
wilson,
petitioner,
versus
donald
f.
schnettler
et
al.
gentlemen,
we
would
not
finish
--
we
would
not
take
this
case
up
ordinarily
but
because
we
wouldn't
be
finishing
it
by
--
for
adjournment
time
but
mr.
doherty
because
you
do
come
from
a
long
distance
we
are
going
to
--
we're
going
to
continue
to
and
finish
your
case
today.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
objection?
we
have
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
friedman,
you
may
get
it
to
the
court
with
the
proper
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
is
not
yet
been
tried
there
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
judge
--
what
reason
did
the
judge
give
for
that,
do
you
recall?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
will
have
the
transcript,
we
will
have
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
--
don't
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
doherty.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
does
he
--
when
does
the
supervisory
power
attached
for
the
first
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
he
not
been
arrested
by
federal
officials
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
couldn't
he
go
in
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
even
though
the
power
of
the
federal
court's
supervisory
power
attaches
when
a
federal
agent
arrest
a
man
that
was
done
in
this
case;
that
supervisory
power
can
be
defeated
solely
by
the
agent
taking
him
to
the
state
courts
instead
of
to
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
--
what
--
under
our
rules,
under
this
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
what
is
the
duty
of
a
federal
agent
when
he
arrest
a
man
for
a
federal
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
--
then
can
he
defeat
the
rules
of
the
--
of
the
court
merely
by
doing
something
different?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
take
him
over
to
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
the
--
that
the
general
statute
authorizing
the
cooperation
of
federal
officers
or
state
officers
supersedes
the
rules
of
this
--
of
this
court
or
the
administration
if
justice
in
federal
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
do
you
avoid
it?
how
do
you
avoid
it
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
is
no
use
of
argument
if
you're
--
if
you're
not
going
to
concede
that.
why
is
that,
tell
me
why
it
isn't
a
violation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
then
it's
your
position
that
any
time
a
federal
officer
arrest
a
man
for
a
federal
crime,
he
can,
instead
of
taking
to
the
commissioner,
can
turn
him
over
to
the
local
authorities
for
prosecution.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
why
do
you
say
without
attempt
to
evade,
is
there
any
proof
that
there
was
no
evasion
of
the
rule?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
they
want
a
hearing
on
that.
why
aren't
they
entitled
to
it
if
they
should
be
able
to
sustain
that
allegation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
they
determine
for
the
federal
courts
whether
the
federal
rules
have
been
respected?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
issue
raised
in
that
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
the
other
arm
of
the
dilemma.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
just
said
to
me
a
few
moments
ago
that
our
supervisory
process
attached
the
minute
an
agent
arrested
the
man
for
federal
crime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
a
man
will
be
put
to
all
of
that
trouble
--
all
of
that
trouble,
why
that
shouldn't
he
be
able
in
a
declaratory
relief
action
to
come
here
and
ask
the
--
ask
the
court
now
to
exercise
a
supervisory
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
it
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course
it
doesn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
why
asked
because
i
haven't
read.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
don't
mean
to
tell
us
that
that's
the
universal
practice,
do
you?
we
had
a
little
case
here
just
awhile
back
and
i
wrote
the
opinion
on
it
where,
where
a
government
agent
stayed
around
the
--
the
doctor's
office
for
three
months
until
he
induced
afore
addict
who
was
trying
to
break
himself
off
the
habit
to
go
out
and
get
into
the
racket
again
and
they
gave
him
15
years
for
--
in
the
federal
system.
now,
there
couldn't
have
been
anything
smaller
or
more
picayunish
than
that
and
they
didn't
turn
that
over
to
the
state
authorities
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
why
do
you
tell
us
that
that's
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
rule
of
the
federal
agents?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
tell
me
that
none
of
those
400
were
--
were
taken
before
a
magistrate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
what
good
in
your
figures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
don't
amount
to
anything
if
--
if
after
a
man
whose
been
arraigned,
did
he
take
him
before
the
court
and
they
decide
they
don't
want
to
prosecute
him
federally,
they
can
dismiss
it
and
not
include
in
the
state
court
but
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
those
cases
if
they
did
take
him
to
a
--
to
a
magistrate
and
this
case
where
they
arrested
him
and
then
avoided
taking
him
to
the
federal
court
by
taking
him
down
to
the
--
the
police
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
might
suggest
the
better
way
to
--
to
avoid
that
conflict
would
be
for
the
officers
--
federal
officers
when
they
arrest
people
to
take
them
before
the
federal
courts
under
the
rule,
and
he
won't
get
into
that
conflict.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
--
as
i
would
view
it,
i
would
say
that
the
man
is
not
just
objecting
because
he
wasn't
arraigned,
he
is
objecting
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
--
to
be
prosecuted
if
he
is
to
be
prosecuted
under
a
federal
arrest
by
the
federal
courts
that
are
constituted
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
being
prosecuted
the
minute
he
was
arrested.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
yourself
said,
mr.
friedman
that
--
that
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
was
passed
the
minute
he
was
arrested.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
doherty.
