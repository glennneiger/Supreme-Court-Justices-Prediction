mr.
i.
henry
kutz
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
circuit
held
and
we
think
correctly
that
there
was
only
one
property
here
that
was
the
proceeds
of
this
insurance
company.
in
that
property,
the
wife
and
the
daughter
had
interest.
the
daughter's
interest
necessarily
if
it
ever
ripen
into
enjoin
had
to
follow
the
wife
and
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
which
mr.
day
read
to
the
court
will
be
proceeds.
the
statute
very
carefully
distinguished
between
property
and
interest
and
provided
that
if
an
interest
in
one
property
follows
the
surviving
spouse's
interest
then
the
bequest
to
the
surviving
spouse
does
not
qualify
with
the
marital
deduction.
for
example,
a
device
of
two
mother
and
daughter
has
joint
tenants
with
right
of
survival
will
not
there
--
will
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
because
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
daughter's
interest
will
come
in
to
enjoin
after
the
wife.
now,
the
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
tenants
in
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
in
tenants
in
common.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that
would
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
--
that
would
qualify
because
the
daughter
would
never
take
after
the
mother.
they
both
have
interest
in
the
same
property.
the
law
is
very
specific
and
i
might
say
that
the
committee
before
go
into
great
detail
on
this
document
and
emphasized
the
different
as
does
the
regulation
between
property
and
interest.
the
idea
is
they
give
the
--
under
the
term
or
interest
rule
that
the
surviving
spouse
shall
get
everything
out,
nothing
shall
follow.
i
would
like
to
read
from
the
appendix
to
our
brief
page
65
to
show
the
manner
in
which
the
committee
report
describes
determinable
interest.
and
in
particular
of
clause
2
of
the
statute
which
is
the
one
that
provides
that
if
the
interest
to
the
other
person
follows
the
wife's
interest
then
it
doesn't
right.
i'm
now
reading
from
right
on
page
65
right
under
were
b
(12),
this
is
from
the
finance
committee
report
of
the
senate.
clause
2
of
subparagraph
be
applied
if
any
persons
other
than
the
surviving
spouse
or
his
heirs
or
assigned
made
by
any
possible
circumstances,
by
any
possible
circumstances
under
the
terms
of
the
bequest
for
those
are
enjoyed
any
part
of
the
property
in
which
the
surviving
spouse's
interest
is
an
interest.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i'm
not
sure
i've
found
the
place
your
honor.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes
sir.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
which
sentence
is
your
honor
referring
to?
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
yes.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
it
is
if
no
one
can
take
after
it.
for
instance
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
no.
but
it's
not
an
interest
somebody
must
take
after
the
life
estate
but
in
the
event
that
it
doesn't
passed
from
the
decedent.
for
instance
if
the
decedent
believes
a
path
or
a
term
for
year
then
and
that's
all
and
he
has
no
further
interest
then
the
bequest
will
qualify.
but
if
there
is
a
further
interest
passing
from
the
decedent
as
there
was
here,
there
was
an
interest
passing
from
decedent
through
the
daughter
then
it
will
not
qualify
because
if
that
interest
ever
ripens,
it
would
ripen
after
the
wife's
interest.
now,
the
committee
reports
discussing
for
the
example
which
the
second
circuit
found
helpful
and
which
i
think
are
helpful
and
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
in
particular
respect
to
--
to
policies,
insurance
policy
and
annuity.
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
we
give
the
person's
interest
and
this
example
show
that
the
proceeds
of
a
policy
are
dealt
with
as
one
property,
not
several
properties
and
as
we
claim
in
this
case,
both
daughter
and
mother
had
an
interest
in
one
property
namely
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
and
may
i
read
with
the
court's
permission
example
1,
quoted
on
page
29.
“the
entire
proceeds
of
an
insurance
policy
on
the
life
of
the
decedent
are
payable
to
the
surviving
spouse
and
the
value
of
such
proceeds
is
included
in
determining
the
value
of
the
gross
estate.”
a
marital
deduction
is
allowed
with
respect
to
the
value
of
the
proceeds
because
no
person
other
than
the
surviving
spouse
has
an
interest
in
the
proceeds.
the
result
will
be
the
same
whether
such
proceeds
are
payable
in
a
lump
sum
are
payable
in
installments
to
the
surviving
spouse,
their
heirs
or
assigns
for
a
term
or
are
payable
to
the
surviving
spouse
for
her
life
with
no
refund
of
the
undistributed
proceeds
or
with
such
a
refund
to
her
state.
now,
example
2
is
given
on
page
30
and
that
deals
with
the
case
where
there
are
refunds
and
this
what
the
committee
report
said,
the
decedent
during
his
lifetime
purchased
an
annuity
contract
under
which
the
annuity
with
payable
during
his
life
and
then
to
his
spouse
during
her
life
if
she
survived
then
the
value
would
be
interest
of
the
decedent
surviving
spouse
in
such
contract
at
the
death
of
the
decedent
that's
included
in
determining
the
value
of
the
gross
estate.
a
marital
deduction
is
allowed
with
respect
to
the
value
of
such
interest
so
passing
to
the
decedent
surviving
spouse
in
as
much
as
no
other
person
has
an
interest
in
the
contract.
if
upon
the
death
of
the
surviving
spouse,
the
annuity
payments
were
to
continue
for
a
term
to
her
estate
or
the
undistributed
portion
thereof
was
paid
to
her
estate
the
deduction
has
never
alleged
allowed
with
respect
to
such
interest.
if
however
upon
the
death
of
the
surviving
spouse,
the
payments
are
to
continue
to
another
person
not
to
her
estate
or
the
undistributed
fund
that
could
be
paid
to
such
other
person,
no
marriageable
--
marital
deduction
was
allowable
in
as
much
as
an
interest
passed
from
the
decedent
to
such
other
person
and
that
is
in
the
substance
exactly
what
happened
here.
now,
the
reliance
upon
the
book
keeping
transactions
and
entries
of
the
insurance
company
seems
to
us
quite
misplaced.
the
insurance
company
is
just
figuring
risks.
there's
--
the
(inaudible)
can't
make
separate
properties
of
what
is
one
property,
there
is
only
one
property
and
that
is
the
insurance
policy.
i'd
like
to
read
from
the
record
on
page
11,
the
--
which
is
--
i'm
sorry,
on
page
6,
paragraph
11,
that
is
the
stipulation
of
fact
and
that
fact
was
found
by
the
district
court.
neither
of
the
above
referred
to
policies
provide
and
the
decedent
did
not
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
neither
the
above
policies
--
referred
to
policies
provide
that
the
decedent
did
not
request
--
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
that
there'd
be
any
segregation
of
the
proceeds
to
the
policy
between
the
amounts
computable
for
the
terms
certain
and
the
amounts
computable
for
the
funding
of
the
contingent
life
annuity.
both
of
the
policies
provide
that
the
policy
in
the
application
therefore
constitute
the
--
the
entire
contract
between
the
party.
mr.
i.
henry
kutz
i'm
not
--
i'd
rather
doubt
that
it
would
unless
there
was
a
complete
provision
for
different
premiums
being
paid
for
different
properties.
now,
this
was
just
an
interest
in
one
--
in
one
proceeds.
it
was
an
interest
in
one
contract.
it
would've
been
quite
a
different
thing.
there
is
a
provision
under
the
statute,
the
subparagraph
g
under
which
if
the
wife
is
given
a
life
interest
on
the
policy
that
his
payments
for
life
was
powered
through
a
point
an
exclusive
unlimited
power
of
appointment,
she
may
--
then
in
that
event,
and
that
is
stated
to
be
an
exception
to
determinable
interest
rule
in
that
event,
the
gift
is
qualified
to
the
marital
deduction
but
that
is
very
different
than
what
happened
here.
she
was
given,
the
decedent
choose
to
retain
the
power
to
give
an
interest
to
his
daughter.
he
didn't
leave
it
to
his
wife
to
that.
a
community
property
state,
she
would've
and
insofar
as
community
property
is
concerned,
she
would've
had
the
power
to
decide
whether
she
wanted
to
give
it
to
the
daughter
or
not.
and
that
determinable
interest
rule
has
been
set
to
be
the
heart
of
the
marital
deduction.
they
wanted
to
equalize
the
impact
to
the
estate
tax
in
the
two
types
of
jurisdiction
and
therefore
they
wanted
to
create
to
permit
the
deduction
only
in
cases
where
the
wife
got
what
was
substantially
an
absolute
and
outright
interest
such
as
her
interest
would've
been
and
under
community
property.
now,
as
another
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
so
far
as
this
bookkeeping
entry
division
say
$17,000
for
the
20
year
certain
and
$7,000
for
monthly
income
thereafter
that
actually
doesn't
represent
the
company's
true
liability
with
respect
to
this
policy
because
if
this
lady
live
to
be
a
very
old
lady
the
$7,000
wouldn't
possibly
have
covered
that.
that's
just
for
their
convenience.
what
was
given
here
was
a
life
interest
in
this
widow.
she
was
given
a
$95
a
month
for
life
under
one
of
the
policies
in
a
different
amount
under
the
other.
there
was
a
provision
that
if
she
didn't
received
if
she
didn't
live
for
20
years
then
her
daughter
would've
got
the
balance
between
the
number
of
years
she
didn't
live
and
the
20
years.
but
it
is
one
interest,
if
one
life
interest
in
fact,
the
--
that
is
what
is
called
under
the
option
is
called
in
the
northwestern
policy
installments
continuous
for
life
and
under
the
john
hancock
policy
it's
called
life
interest.
now,
the
bookkeeping
interest
of
an
insurance
company
cannot
make
two
properties
out
of
what
is
one
property
and
what
obviously
the
committee
reports
considered
with
one
property.
the
--
in
the
ryle
case
which
is
the
case
which
conflicted
with
the
decision
below
an
example
is
given
by
the
third
circuit
which
the
--
that
court
thought
sustain
to
view
which
taxpayer
is
taken
but
as
the
second
circuit
points
out
that
example
the
third
circuit
misconstrued
that
example
and
i
would
like
that
the
example
in
the
question
is
on
page
26
of
our
brief
and
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
the
court.
in
the
case
of
certain
property
which
is
determinable
a
marital
deduction
maybe
allowed
even
though
clause
1
applies
as
long
as
clause
2
does
not
applied.
thus,
if
the
decedent
bequest
all
the
interest
he
ever
had
in
the
patent
to
his
wife
and
daughter,
as
tenants
in
common
the
marital
deduction
is
allowed
with
respect
to
the
interest
of
the
wife
in
patent.
if
however,
the
patent
was
bequest
to
them
for
joint
lives
and
then
to
the
survivor,
the
marital
deduction
would
not
be
allowed.
now,
the
reason
why
the
marital
deduction
is
allowed
in
the
case
where
the
patent
is
given
to
the
wife
and
daughter
as
tenants
in
common
is
because
the
daughter
gets
nothing
after
the
end
of
the
wife's
life.
she
can
only
--
she
receives
it
from
the
beginning
and
there
is
no
--
there's
no
possibility
that
she
will
obtain
anything
after
the
conclusion
of
the
wife's
life
or
the
wife's
interest.
accordingly,
she
gets
in
that
case
would
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
now,
the
treasury
regulation
confirms
the
second
circuit's
construction
of
this
example.
on
page
51
of
our
brief,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
we
--
the
regulations
give
the
example
on
the
question.
h
--
a
husband
bequeaths
a
patent
to
w
and
a
is
tenants
in
common.
in
this
case,
the
interest
of
w
will
terminate
upon
the
expiration
of
the
term
of
the
patent
but
possession
or
enjoyment
of
the
property
by
a
must
necessarily
cease
at
the
same
time.
therefore
since
a's
possessions
are
enjoined
cannot
outlast
determination
of
w's
interest
the
latter
is
deductable
interest.
here
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
daughter
takes
it
all,
she
must
take
after
her
mother
and
accordingly
we
submit
that
under
the
terms
of
the
regulations,
the
examples
given
in
the
committee
report
and
the
statute
the
--
this
--
the
policy
--
the
proceeds
of
these
policies
did
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
what
in
effect
taxpayer
is
doing
is
trying
to
amend
the
contract
and
we
submit
he
can
no
more
do
that
than
he
can
amend
the
statute.
by
saying
that
there
were
two
properties
here,
the
contract
provided
for
only
one
and
only
one
--
in
which
it
created
an
interest
in
the
wife
and
then
interest
in
the
daughter.
there
--
since
there
was
only
one
property
with
interest
in
those
property
in
that
property
created
and
the
interest
to
the
daughter
must
follow
the
interest
to
the
wife.
never
could
come
before
the
marital
deduction,
does
not
qualified
with
the
marital
deduction.
