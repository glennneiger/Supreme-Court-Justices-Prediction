mr.
donald
s.
day
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
a
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
by
a
divided
court,
holding
that
no
part
of
the
death
proceeds
of
certain
life
insurance
policies
which
constitute
a
part
of
the
insured
gross
estate
for
state
tax
purposes,
qualify
for
the
so
called
marital
deduction.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision,
which
reversed
a
judgment
of
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
new
york
in
favor
of
petitioners,
was
in
direct
conflict
with
an
earlier
decision
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
on
the
precise
question
and
almost
–
on
almost
identical
facts.
in
the
case
of
ryle
against
commissioner
which
was
decided
in
january
of
1957.
now
at
issue
in
this
appeal,
is
the
construction
of
section
812
(e)
(1),
(a)
and
(b)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939
is
amended
by
the
laws
of
1948
and
with
your
permission
i
would
like
first
to
discuss
generally
this
statute
before
going
into
the
facts
of
the
case.
this
section,
which
involved
the
so-called
marital
deduction,
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1948
as
part
of
an
overall
plan
to
equalize
the
impact
of
the
estate
taxes
upon
married
persons
and
community
property
estates
with
those
in
common
law
estates
and
i
believe
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
this
court
which
involves
marital
deduction.
now,
the
equating
of
the
estate
tax
further
was
accomplished
by
congress
allowing
the
deduction
about
50%
of
the
gross
estate
of
the
spouse
first
to
die
or
outright
transfers
of
property
to
the
surviving
spouse.
those
assets
which
were
removed
from
the
estate
of
the
spouse
first
to
die
are
then
exposed
to
death
--
to
tax
upon
the
death
of
the
surviving
spouse.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
deduction
in
a
consequent
postponement
of
the
tax
is
to
assure
that
the
proper
--
that
the
property
of
a
marital
community
will
be
subject
to
a
estate
tax
only
once
in
the
estate
of
each
spouse.
now
in
community
property
estate
of
course,
the
surviving
spouse's
interest
in
the
community
property
is
unrestricted
and
unqualified.
therefore,
in
order
to
prevent
abuses
and
tax
avoidance
through
the
use
of
a
marital
deduction,
congress
of
1948,
when
it
put
into
effect
the
marital
deduction
law,
sought
to
enact
what
they
call
determinable
interest
rule
and
which
became
part
of
section
812
(e).
now,
this
rule
in
effect
simply
accepts
from
the
marital
deduction
any
asset
of
the
estate
which
is
transferred
to
the
spouse
and
which
may
by
any
event
ultimately
pass
from
the
decedent
to
any
person
for
less
than
consideration
of
money
or
money's
worth
and
be
possessed
and
enjoyed
by
such
person
after
the
surviving
spouse.
the
--
with
this
back
on
my
mind,
i
would
like
you
to
go
into
the
facts
for
this
particular
case.
the
plaintiffs
are
the
executors
under
the
last
will
and
testament
of
albert
meyer
who
died
in
buffalo,
new
york
in
1952.
now,
in
filing
the
estate
tax
return
as
part
of
schedule
m,
the
executors
showed
as
part
of
the
proceeds
passing
to
the
surviving
spouse,
the
proceeds
of
two
insurance
policies
which
totaled
some
$30,000.
these
amounts
included
the
proceeds
of
one
insurance
policy
for
northwestern
mutual
life
insurance
company
in
the
amount
of
$25,000
and
the
proceeds
from
an
insurance
policy
from
the
john
hancock
mutual
life
insurance
company
in
the
amount
of
$5,000.
about
12
years
prior
of
his
death,
the
decedent
had
filed
with
the
insurance
companies
an
election
of
settlement
option
and
a
substantially
identical
election
was
made
under
both
of
the
policies.
in
effect,
the
settlement
option
provided
that
upon
the
death
of
the
insured,
the
surviving
spouse
who
was
named
as
primary
beneficiary,
the
wife
in
this
case,
were
to
be
paid
an
annual
income
in
monthly
payments
for
a
period
of
20
years
in
accordance
with
the
table
set
forth
in
the
body
of
the
policy
and
depending
upon
the
age
of
the
surviving
spouse
at
the
time
of
the
insured's
death.
the
election
--
the
option
further
provided
that
in
the
event
that
the
spouse
died
after
payments
begin,
but
before
the
expiration
of
the
20-year
period
that
in
that
event
the
payments
were
to
continue
to
the
insured's
daughter.
it
further
provided
that
in
the
event
that
both
the
insured's
spouse
and
the
insured's
daughter
died
within
the
20th
period
then
the
commuted
value
of
the
payments
still
having
of
the
20
years
service
still
remaining
unpaid
would
then
be
paid
to
the
executor
or
the
administrator
of
the
last
surviving
party
involved.
mr.
donald
s.
day
no
your
honor,
she
would
not
have
got
that
entire
proceeds
she
would
have
gotten
an
income
for
the
20-year
period
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
no
your
honor,
i
want
to
explain
that
at
this
moment.
upon
the
death
of
the
insured
and
upon
proof
of
the
age
of
the
spouse
her
age
was
42
at
the
time,
the
insurance
companies
make
a
calculation
and
this
is
the
practice
of
the
insurance
industry,
they
use
the
actuarial
tables
and
on
this
particular
case,
they
determined
by
their
actuarial
tables
that
of
the
total
proceeds
of
a
northwestern
mutual
life
insurance
policy
of
$25,000,
$18,000
was
necessary
to
fund
the
life
certain
of
20
years.
the
balance
of
the
policy,
$7,000
was
necessary
to
fund
the
contingent
life
annuity.
now
the
john
hancock
life
insurance
company
did
exactly
the
same
thing.
they
made
actuarial
computation
and
according
to
that
computation,
they
determined
that
with
respect
to
their
policy
the
face
value
of
which
was
$5,000,
$4,000
was
necessary
to
fund
the
life
certain
for
20
years
and
$1,000
was
necessary
to
fund
the
contingent
life
annuity.
so,
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice,
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
policy
would
not
depending
(voice
overlap)
for
20
years.
mr.
donald
s.
day
the
--
the
--
i
did
not
get
to
that
mr.
justice.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
this.
mr.
donald
s.
day
the
options
further
provided
that
in
the
event
that
the
wife
lived
beyond
20-year-period
that
she
continue
to
receive
a
monthly
income
in
the
same
amount
which
she
had
received
during
the
prior
20
years
and
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
funding
that
contingent
life
annuity
that
the
insurance
companies
set
aside
the
$7,000
in
the
case
of
the
north
western
policy
and
the
$1,000
in
the
case
of
the
john
hancock
policy.
now,
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
if
the
death
of
the
primary
beneficiary
of
the
period
of
the
expiration
of
20
years
then
actually
with
respect
to
the
northwestern
policy
only
$17,000
of
the
$25,000
death
proceeds
of
that
policy
would've
been
used
and
the
insurance
company
would
have
put
in
their
pocket
the
balance
of
the
$8,000.
mr.
donald
s.
day
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
donald
s.
day
the
beneficiary
could
be
all
free,
that's
correct.
now,
the
estate
tax
return
was
filed
i
believe
in
1954
and
the
estate
tax
was
paid.
and
in
the
1957
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations
a
claim
for
refund
was
made
with
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue.
and
the
claim
was
made
on
this
basis,
and
it
was
made
on
the
basis
frankly
of
the
decision
which
was
rendered
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
third
circuit
in
ryle
decision
which
had
been
handed
down
in
january
of
1957
which
as
i
stated
involved
these
identical
facts.
the
--
we
recognize
in
the
statement
that
certainly
would
respect
to
that
part
of
the
proceeds
of
the
life
insurance
policy
which
was
necessary
to
fund
the
20
years
certain
term
those
parts
of
the
proceeds
did
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
because
someone
else
other
than
the
spouse
had
an
interest
in
the
proceeds
namely
the
daughter.
in
other
words,
if
the
wife
had
died
on
the
15th
year
the
payment
would
have
continued
to
the
daughter
for
a
period
of
five
years
if
she
had
survived.
so,
with
respect
to
that,
we
recognize
that
part
of
the
proceeds
that
the
terminable
interest
rule
as
set
forth
in
section
812
does
disqualify
that
from
the
marital
deduction.
but
the
claim
for
refund
was
based
on
the
complaint
that
the
balance
of
the
proceeds
of
these
policies
namely
the
$7,000
which
the
northwestern
mutual
life
insurance
company
had
determined
was
necessary
to
fund
the
contingent
life
annuity,
and
the
$1,000
as
computed
by
the
john
hancock
life
insurance
company
on
their
policy,
that
part
of
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
did
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
because
no
one
else
other
than
the
surviving
spouse
had
any
interest
whatsoever
in
that
property
except
the
insurance
company
which
had
obtained
it
for
a
consideration
in
money
or
money's
worth
because
after
all
this
was
(inaudible)
transaction
between
the
insured
in
the
insurance
company.
the
daughter
was
not
a
contingent
beneficiary
with
respect
to
that
part
of
the
proceeds
of
the
policy.
now,
the
claim
was
disallowed,
suit
was
instituted
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
as
i
stated
appeal
was
taken
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
divided
court
at
two
to
one
decision,
the
district
court
decision
was
reversed
and
we
petitioned
for
writ
of
certiorari
which
brings
us
here.
now,
the
search
in
itself
for
statute,
we
have
set
forth
in
page
14
of
the
brief
the
determinable
interest
rule
as
specifically
stated
in
section
812
(e)
(1),
(b)
(1)
and
(2)
and
it
reads
whereupon
the
lapse
of
time
or
upon
the
occurrence
of
an
event
of
contingency
or
upon
the
failure
of
an
event
of
contingency
to
occur
such
interest
passing
to
the
surviving
spouse
will
terminate
or
fail,
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
in
respect
to
such
interest.
if
an
interest
in
such
property
passes
or
has
passed
for
less
than
inadequate
both
consideration
in
money
or
money's
worth
from
the
decedent
to
any
person
other
than
such
surviving
spouse
or
the
estate
of
that
person
and
if
by
reason
of
such
passing
such
person
or
his
assigns
may
possess
or
enjoy
any
part
of
such
property
after
such
termination
or
failure
of
the
interest
so
passing
to
the
surviving
spouse.
now,
this
simply
means
that
we
believe
that
under
no
circumstances
may
any
person
succeed
to
the
property
in
which
the
surviving
spouse
has
an
interest
if
that
property
is
to
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
we
take
the
position
on
this
appeal
as
we
have
taken
in
the
lower
courts
that
the
proceeds
of
this
life
insurance
policy
are
susceptible
and
should
be
construed
as
in
effect
creating
two
problems
one,
with
respect
to
northwestern
policy
that
property
which
is
necessary
to
fund
the
life
certain
for
20
years
and
also
with
respect
to
that
policy,
the
balance
of
the
proceeds
namely
$7,000
which
is
necessary
to
fund
the
contingent
life
annuity
in
whom
no
one
else
has
an
interest
other
than
the
surviving
spouse.
we
believe
that
the
purpose
of
marital
deduction
statute
would
be
accomplished
by
this
interpretation
of
the
section.
mr.
donald
s.
day
well,
if
there
is
no
one
no
requirement
in
the
policy
that
the
--
that
there
be
a
segregation;
there's
no
contractual
obligation
specifically
set
out
in
the
policy
that
there
be
a
segregation
of
the
proceeds.
however,
the
settlement
option
of
course
does
refer
to
the
table
in
the
policy
and
it
is
specifically
set
out
of
course
that
the
payments
are
dependent
upon
the
age
of
the
surviving
spouse
at
the
time
of
the
decedent.
now,
we
take
the
position
that
simply
because
both
of
these
properties
have
a
genesis
in
the
same
contract
that
they
must
not
necessarily
be
regarded
as
one
property
but
for
the
purposes
of
the
marital
deduction
rule
maybe
considered
as
two
properties
one
of
which
only
the
spouse
has
an
interest.
now
what
will
be
the
result
of
this
interpretation?
well,
it
will
simply
mean
this;
it
will
simply
mean
that
this
surviving
spouse
will
not
be
taxed
on
a
contingency,
on
an
expectancy
because
if
the
proceeds
of
these
two
policies
which
are
necessary
only
to
fund
the
contingent
life
annuity
are
included
in
the
gross
estate
and
no
deduction
is
given
to
them
under
the
marital
deduction
process
then
the
gross
estate
is
for
tax
solely
on
an
expectancy
because
the
woman
--
because
the
surviving
spouse
may
not
live
out
for
20
years.
it
will
mean
therefore
that
the
only
benefit
which
the
surviving
spouse
will
obtain
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
the
benefit
which
congress
intended
to
give
to
all
taxpayers
in
common
law
state
is
that
of
postponement.
in
other
words,
if
the
wife
does
live
more
than
a
20-year-period,
then
the
proceeds
of
that
part
of
the
policy
necessary
to
fund
the
contingent
life
annuity
as
it
was
received
by
her
and
becomes
part
of
her
taxable
state
well
it
is
true
be
subject
to
the
estate
tax
and
all
of
them
will
be
taxed.
now,
i
don't
believe
that
the
government
seriously
contests
the
argument
that
if
the
policy
specifically
provided
for
the
separation
of
these
two
different
parts
of
the
proceeds
of
the
life
insurance
policy
that
that
part
necessary
to
fund
the
contingent
life
annuity
would
not
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction.
i
think
the
essence
of
their
argument
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
judge
waterman
who
wrote
the
dissent
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
stated
that
he
was
quite
sure
that
the
--
that
the
majority
of
the
court
would
have
agreed
with
him
that
if
that
happened
and
if
there
was
that
provision
in
the
context
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
majority
decision
would
have
ruled
otherwise.
while
the
policy
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
for
the
actual
segregation.
mr.
donald
s.
day
there
was
a
segregation
on
the
books
of
the
insurance
company
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
yes
sir,
yes
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
day
i
believe
there
is
your
honor,
there's
a
lacking
of
provision
for
that,
there
is
lacking
also
of
the
--
it
would
be
very
truthful
of
the
fact
that
the
insurance
company
i
believe
is
probably
comingles
for
these
facts.
mr.
donald
s.
day
they
said
is
the
bookkeeping
factors
of
the
insurance
companies
it
is
the
actuary
of
practice
i
believe
of
the
entire
insurance
industry
with
respect
to
all
policies
of
this
claim.
mr.
donald
s.
day
i
don't
believe
that
would
have
your
honor.
i
believe
they
still
would've
been
coming.
mr.
donald
s.
day
there,
in
effect
is
what
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
your
honor.
that
is
the
only
argument
between
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
third
circuit.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
the
third
circuit
said
by
unanimous
court
there
were
two
properties
here
which
were
created
upon
the
occurrence
of
the
death
of
the
insured.
his
death
gave
rise
to
the
creation
of
two
properties.
we
see
that
with
respect
to
one
of
these
two
properties
that
there
is
an
interest
with
somebody
else
other
than
the
spouse
can
get.
mr.
donald
s.
day
well,
we
believe
your
honor
that
the
term
“property”
is
used
by
congress
in
the
enactment
of
the
marital
deduction
section
should
be
liberally
construed.
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
difference
between
interest
and
between
properties.
we
recognize
that
certainly
an
interest
maybe
only
part
of
a
property.
we
recognize
that
with
respect
to
the
amount
that
i
am
talking
about
namely
that
part
which
is
necessary
to
fund
the
contingent
annuity,
there
are
two
interests
in
that
property.
there
is
an
interest
of
the
wife
obviously
and
there
is
an
interest
of
the
insurance
company
too,
but
the
insurance
company's
interest
is
one
which
was
received
for
a
consideration
in
money
or
money's
worth
because
again,
if
the
wife
lives
only
25
years
then
part
of
the
$7,000
for
example
on
the
northwestern
mutual
policy
will
go
back
in
the
pocket
of
the
northwestern
mutual
life
insurance
company.
so,
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
that
may
--
i
think
probably
your
honor
that
the
question
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
file
upon
the
realization
of
the
--
of
this
practice
when
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
rendered
its
decision
in
the
ryder
case,
i'm
willing
to
recognize
that.
mr.
donald
s.
day
but
i
think
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
well,
i
think
this
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
no,
i
don't
think
it's
quite
that
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
a
recognition
here
and
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
it
that
the
insurance
company
in
effect
must
make
this
calculation
because
the
insurance
company
must
know
what
proceeds
are
to
be
paid
to
the
daughter
for
example
if
the
wife
begins
to
receive
the
payments
and
died
before
the
expiration
of
the
20-year
period.
the
insurance
company
must
know
what
part
of
the
death
proceeds
of
the
policy
to
be
paid
to
the
estate
of
the
daughter
or
the
state
of
the
spouse.
mr.
donald
s.
day
i
think
that
so
your
honor.
i
speak
with
all
frankness
when
i
say
that
while
it
is
inherent
in
the
arrangement
perhaps
more
practitioners
were
not
aware
of
the
precise
point
until
this
particular
case
came
up.
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
inherent
in
the
arrangement
and
i
think
that
this
was
a
contractual
obligation
which
was
entered
into
between
the
insured
and
the
insurance
company
and
while
it
was
not
specifically
spelled
out
i
think
the
insurance
company
is
under
an
obligation
to
make
this
division
of
the
properties.
now,
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
well,
that's
precisely
our
point.
mr.
donald
s.
day
or
in
there
but
frankly
the
practice
of
the
industry
is
to
do
what
on
the
box
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
yes
your
honor,
we
take
the
position
that
the
insured
actually
bargained
for
this,
that
he
could
have
elected
another
option
but
this
is
the
option
that
he
do.
mr.
donald
s.
day
i
think
this
carries
up
precisely
the
intent
of
the
insured
when
he
elected
this
option
prior
to
the
state,
yes.
i
would
like
to
save
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
s.
day
i
think
probably
that
the
error
of
the
government's
position
is
pointed
out
by
counsel
statement
that
there
is
only
one
property,
since
there
was
only
one
insurance
policy.
i
don't
think
that's
quite
correct.
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
more
than
one
property
can
strain
from
an
insurance
policy.
i
think
certainly
if
the
--
this
insurance
property,
this
insurance
policy
provided
that
upon
the
death
on
the
insured
50%
of
the
proceeds
were
to
be
paid
to
a
son
a
named
beneficiary
and
50%
of
the
proceeds
were
to
be
paid
for
the
wife,
certainly
with
respect
to
the
50%
which
went
to
the
wife,
there
would
be
no
question
of
the
qualification
of
those
proceeds
for
the
marital
deduction
and
yet
out
of
the
one
policy
we
find
two
properties
because
we
have
a
property
first
to
the
wife
and
secondly
to
the
son.
now,
i
think
probably
the
error
of
the
government
position
is
also
pointed
out
in
the
calling
to
the
court's
attention
the
example
number
one
on
page
29
which
counsel
read
to
the
court
in
which
it
deals
again
with
an
example
discussed
by
the
senate
committee
and
which
the
senate
committee
specifically
professes
the
example
by
this
statement
the
entire
proceeds
of
an
insurance
policy
on
the
life
of
the
decedent
are
payable
to
the
surviving
spouse
then
it
gives
the
conditions
under
which
payment
is
to
be
made
for
the
spouse
and
i
think
there
all
we
have
to
say
is
this.
yes,
this
--
in
this
particular
case
the
government
is
correct
because
the
entire
policy,
the
entire
proceeds
constitutes
the
one
single
property
which
is
left
out
of
the
proceeds
in
the
insurance
policy
which
came
to
being
upon
the
death
of
the
insured.
but
i
don't
think
that
this
means
at
all
and
i
don't
think
that
any
of
the
other
examples
which
were
before
the
senate
committee
or
any
other
of
the
examples
and
the
regulations
indicate
for
one
moment
that
there
cannot
be
two
properties
formed
on
one
insurance
policy.
in
each
and
every
one
of
the
examples
before
the
committee
report
--
before
the
committee
and
in
each
and
every
one
of
the
example
set
forth
in
the
regulations
we
find
that
the
entire
proceeds
of
the
insurance
policies
or
annuity
contracts
involved
were
vested
either
in
the
wife
or
in
other
person
in
accordance
--
in
accordance
with
the
facts
set
forth
in
those
examples.
but
in
no
example
either
before
the
committee
or
before
or
in
the
regulations
is
there
any
suggestion
from
this
case
that
the
proceeds
maybe
payable
to
two
separate
persons
and
that
the
proceeds
may
be
divided
into
various
interest
which
ripen
into
properties
upon
the
death
of
the
insured.
i
think
that
is
the
real
issue
between
us
and
the
government.
mr.
donald
s.
day
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
s.
day
that's
correct.
what
is
left
behind
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
because
there's
a
further
provision.
mr.
donald
s.
day
because
there's
a
further
provision
your
honor
that
the
policy
additionally
provided
that
in
the
event
that
the
wife
lived
longer
than
the
20
year
period
that
she
was
to
receive
in
addition
to
the
fixed
monthly
payment
for
the
20
years
a
contingent
life
annuity
in
the
same
amount
in
which
her
daughter
had
no
interest
whatsoever
and
that
is
the
second
property
which
was
created
by
this
policy
upon
the
death
of
the
insured.
mr.
donald
s.
day
there
are
two
--
those
two
proper
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
day
we
only
talking
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
they
were
only
called
properties
your
honor
because
that
is
the
terminology
which
unfortunately
as
used
by
congress
in
the
patent
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
s.
day
yes,
that's
absolutely
true.
mr.
donald
s.
day
that's
absolutely
true
your
honor
and
with
respect
to
the
contingent
life
annuity
only
the
wife
has
an
interest
though.
no
one
else,
the
daughter
or
anyone
else
as
a
contingent
interest
in
that
life
annuity
and
to
the
extent
of
that
part
of
the
proceeds
of
the
policy
which
were
set
aside
to
fund
this
contingent
life
annuity
we
think
it
should
qualify
for
the
marital
deduction
because
that
part
will
go
outright
to
the
wife
and
to
no
one
else
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
donald
s.
day
i
think
that
--
mr.
donald
s.
day
i'm
sure
that
so.
thank
you.
