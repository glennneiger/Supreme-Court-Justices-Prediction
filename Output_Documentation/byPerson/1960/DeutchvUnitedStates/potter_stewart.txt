been
very
recent,
a
year
or
two
before

and
this

the

fairly
newly
out
of

yes.

mr.

justice

--
with
respect
to
that
--
the
sentence
imposed
by
the
district
judge
and
as
our
job
here,
to
me
the
sentence
is
a
little
ambiguous.
do
you
understand
it
to
be
a
sentence
of
90
days
on
each
count?
justice
potter
stewart
to
run
it
concurrent?
justice
potter
stewart
let
the
--
in
the
paragraph
phase
in
more
recently
in
wilkinson
case
--
the
braden
case
rather.
we
thought
that
since
concurrent
sentences
were
imposed
on
each
count,
it
was
enough
if
the
conviction
on
any
one
count
were
sustainable.
that
is
with
respect
to
anyone
questioned.
justice
potter
stewart
but
since
here
the
total
sentence
was
for
90
days
for
all
four
counts
without
any
explicit
imposition
of
concurrent
individual
sentences
and
a
total
fine
of
$100
for
all
four
counts.i
wondered
if
that
same
approach
would
be
taken
care

examine
all
four
of
the
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
on
all
four
counts.
justice
potter
stewart
that
sounds
(voice

justice
potter

so
that
in
that
--
for
that
reason,
the
approach
taken
on
the
barenblatt
case
and
then
in
the
braden
case
with
respect
to
our
being
able
to
confine
the
examination
to
one
question
that
we
found
--
one
indictment
good
that
was
sufficient,
that
approach
is
subject
to
some
doubt
on
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
there's
nothing
in
it.
it's
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
far
as
we
--
we're
entitled
to
look
at
the
whole
record,
didn't
we
(voice

justice
potter

it's
a
little
narrower
than
that,
isn't
it,
mr.
maroney?
the
question
has
to
be
pertinent
to
a
topic
then
under
inquiry
by
the
committee
as
--
and
also
one
that
the
committee
has
been
authorized
to
investigate.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
haven't
understand

understood
to
be
that.
justice

i
suppose
the
faculty
at
cornell
like
a
faculty
at
most
universities
consist
of
instructors,
assistant
professors,
associate
professors
and
professors,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
who's
just
stated
the
passing
of
--
that
if
we
should
hold
that
anyone
of
these
questions
was
legitimate
and
proper
that
we
should
sustain
the
conviction
in
this
--
that
was
the
approach
taken
in
the
barenblatt
case
and
the
braden
case?
were
there
were
in
fact
specific
--
specifically
imposed
concurrent
sentences.
here,
they
--
they
were
not,
there
were
just
one
general
90-day
sentence
for
--
for
conviction,
isn't
that
true?
and
one
general
$100
crime
for
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
did
you
tell
us
that
ithaca
is
from
albany,
about
150
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i
suppose
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
can
find
that.
