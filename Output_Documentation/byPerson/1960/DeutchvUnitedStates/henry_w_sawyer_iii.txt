mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
it's
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
of
contempt
of
congress.
the
facts
are
these.
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
deutch
was
subpoenaed
and
pursuant
to
subpoena,
appeared
in
washington
with
his
counsel.
he,
there,
went
to
the
house
office
building
and
was
then
show
into
a
room
in
which
a
number
of
unidentified
gentlemen
were
present.
he
was
sworn,
this
being
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
he
was
sworn
and
the
questioning
commenced.
at
this
moment,
he
knew
two
things.
that
he
had
been
subpoenaed
and
that
according
to
newspaper
accounts,
a
man
named
ross
richardson
who
had
been
a
cornell,
a
classmate
of
mr.
deutch's
had
named
him
as
having
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
while
he
was
a
graduate
and
also
an
undergraduate
student
at
cornell.
this
letter
about
mr.
richardson
who
was
at
that
time
an
agent,
an
employee
of
the
fbi
he
knew
only
from
a
newspaper
account.
the
subcommittee
as
it
transpired
by
a
later
publication
of
a
committee
text
was
composed
of
congressman
jackson
as
chairman,
congressman
doyle
and
congressman
scherer.
it
appears
that
this
committee
never
heard
any
other
witness
on
any
other
subject.
the
questioning
after
the
witness
was
sworn
commenced
as
follows.
the
committee
counsel
turned
to
mr.
deutch
and
said,
mr.
deutch
during
hearings
at
albany
last
week
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
sir,
and
also
on
page
16.
if
i
may
read
it
aloud,
mr.
deutch
during
hearings
at
albany
last
week,
the
committee
heard
testimony
regarding
the
existence
of
a
communist
party
group
or
cell
operating
among
undergraduates
of
cornell
university
among
certain
graduates
at
cornell
and
in
the
city
of
ithaca.
in
connection
with
that
testimony,
the
committee
was
informed
that
you
were
a
member
of
one
or
more
of
those
groups.
if
so,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
certain
matters
relating
to
your
activity
there.
were
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
cornell?
after
objecting
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee
and
under
protest
as
deutch
said
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
proceedings,
deutch
stated,
"yes,
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
he
no
longer
was."
he
then
proceeded
under
questioning
to
tell
all
about
the
size,
the
nature,
the
scope,
the
activities
of
this
student
group.
in
the
course
of
that
he
said
this
and
i
would
like
to
quote
if
i
may.
he
said,
when
i
was
a
--
in
the
communist
party,
all
that
happened
were
bull
sessions
on
marxism
and
some
activities
like
giving
out
a
leaflet
or
two.
the
people
i
met
did
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
and
if
they
i
had,
i
would
never
have
allowed
it."
he
then
told
about
how
mr.
richardson,
the
fbi
employee
was
his
group
leader,
how
he
collected
his
dues
and
took
him
to
meetings.
in
fact,
he
said
the
last
meeting
that
he
had
had
was
with
mr.
ross
richardson
alone.
he
told
how
the
campus
group
became
defunct.
how
it
consisted
of
about
four
or
five
people
in
the
proceeding
period
that
before
it
became
as
he
said
virtually
defunct.
he
said
he
never
knew
where
the
local
branch
of
the
communist
party
was.
he
didn't
know
of
the
central
committee
of
ithaca
or
what
it
did.
he
said
that
andy
was
the
only
graduate
student.
he
was
cross-examined
on
the
question
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir
that's
correct
quite
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
quite
recently
within
just
cutting
the
last
meeting
with
ross
richardson
if
that's
counted
as
a
meeting
of
the
party,
it
would
--
would
have
been
just
within
the
year,
and
because
of
the
period
i
speak
of
when
he
went
was
april
1954.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
was
at
the
time
called
a
graduate
student
of
physics
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania,
and
having
left
cornell
and
had
been
at
cornell
a
year
before.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
he
was
cross-examined
on
the
remark
and
his
point
about
force
and
violence
by
congressman
jackson.
the
committee
seemed
satisfied
that
deutch
didn't
know
any
of
the
people
he
knew
had
ever
advocated
or
believed
in
force
and
violence,
and
that
he
had
himself
the
witness
no
knowledge
of
what
the
ultimate
objectives
of
the
party
leadership
might
be.
this
having
been
put
to
him
and
he
said,
no,
of
course
i
only
know
about
the
people
that
i
knew.
he
did
refuse
to
answer
five
questions.
each
of
those
questions
relate
to
another
person
and
the
answer
to
each
of
them
would
require
the
disclosure
of
the
name
of
another
person.
those
indictment
questions
were
reduced
to
four
by
reason
of
acquittal
on
count
3
and
those
questions
appeared
in
the
brief.
excuse
me,
your
honors
--
up
to
pages
8
and
9.
were
you
acquainted
with
homer
owen?
who
it
was
that
recruited
him?
one
other
student
was
that
he's
been
asking
to
join
the
party,
the
source
of
the
contribution
of
$100
and
the
name
of
a
man
who
was
believed
to
have
been
a
member
of
the
faculty.
he
was
cited
for
contempt
and
was
tried
before
judge
holtzoff
without
a
jury,
sentenced
to
three
months
in
jail
and
$100
fine.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
october
10th,
1960.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
mr
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh,
i
misunderstand
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
misunderstood.
i
thought
you
were
asking
me
whether
or
not
he
was
sentenced
to
a
total
of
90
days
or
whether
he
was
sentenced
to
a
total
of
90
days
of
times
four.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
we
--
we
both
can
agree
that
the
maximum
sentence
which
he
would
serve
would
be
90
days.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
on
all
four
counts.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
judge
holtzoff
did
not
specify
that
he
was
sentencing
separately
and
that
they
were
concurrent.
he
didn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
if
i
recall
the
record
on
that
point,
he
just
simply
didn't
say.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
your
honor
i
have
not
argued
it
and
until
this
moment
at
--
very
frankly,
that
has
never
occurred
to
me.
i've
argued
this
case
and
the
government
too
and
the
court's
--
the
appellate
courts
below
have
treated
it
as
if
the
sustaining
of
one
count
would
be
sufficient
although
in
passing
i
note
that
they
sustained
all
four.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
and
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
didn't
own
to.
you're
right
justice
stewart
that
this
is
not
a
point,
which
i
had
a
brief
nor
had
even
occurred
to
me
until
you
suggested
it
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i
hope
there
is,
sir.
i
am
not,
however,
in
a
position
to
help
your
honor
my
argument
because
i
haven't
--
haven't
briefed
the
point.
i
have
four
points
if
i
may
proceed,
your
honors.
four
points
of
the
argument
are
first
of
all
the
almost
now
traditional
watkins'
point
of
subject
matter
and
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
thereto.
the
second
point
unique
in
this
case
is
the
fair
of
the
government's
proof
at
trial
to
conform
at
all
with
the
record
and
the
change
--
since
the
barenblatt
case
in
the
government's
position
as
to
what
the
subject
under
inquiry
was.
the
third
point
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
kind
of
investigation
and
with
the
information
so
fully
supplied
by
the
witness
that
the
names
of
individuals
per
se
could
never
be
acquired
in
this
kind
of
investigation
pursuant
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
and
the
fourth
point
is
that
in
applying
the
balancing
test
suggested
by
this
court
in
the
barenblatt
case
between
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
petitioner
and
the
investigative
power
of
the
congress
that
if
there
is
ever
to
be
a
case
in
which
that
balance
must
still
in
favor
of
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
congressional
committees,
it
--
it
must
be
this
one.
now,
the
first
point
which
i
have
designated
as
the
watkins'
point,
i
must
perforce
by
reason
of
time
deal
with
in
a
most
summary
fashion.
we
know
that
the
requirement
of
this
court
has
been
that
the
subject
matter
and
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
thereto
appear
to
the
witness
at
the
time
with
indisputable
clarity.
on
this,
we
must
recall
that
we
now
are
talking
about
subject
matter
and
pertinency
of
the
questions
only
those
that
the
petitioner
refused
to
answer
whether
it
was
clear
to
him
that
the
subject
in
general
was
communism
at
cornell
would
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
particular
question
such
as
homer
owen,
such
as
the
source
of
$100
contribution,
such
as
the
student
who
recruited
him,
that
pertinency
and
the
link
between
it
and
the
subject
matter
we
say
must
appear
with
clarity.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
on
the
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
yes
indeed,
sir,
we
are.
we
are
entitled
to
look
at
the
record
as
to
the
knowledge
that
he
had.
there,
in
this
case,
we
have
of
course
no
opening
statement
except
what
i
read
to
your
honor.
i
read
you
verbatim
the
totality
of
any
opening
statement.
and
there
i
submit
that
this
is
an
element
of
the
offense
if
the
witnesses
to
be
available
to
him
only
--
the
pertinency
objection
only
if
he
makes
the
objection
in
proper
terms,
we
must
told
the
government
to
what
was
said
here
and
there,
they
said
they
want
to
ask
him
about
his
activity.
they
did
and
he
answered
about
his
activity.
but
there
was
no
opening
statement
in
the
sense
that
there
was
in
the
watkins
or
the
barenblatt
case,
no
general
statement
or
purpose.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir
but
the
witness
didn't
know
anything
about.
and
we'll
take
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
point
as
to
whether
he
raised
that.
that
is
a
separate
point.
did
he
raise
it?
but
--
but
he
didn't
have
it.
and
he
--
he
knew
nothing
about
any
statement.
i
told
the
court
exactly
what
happened.
he
walks
on
the
room
and
he
sworn
the
question
he
commences.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
he
said
--
he
said
i
have
moral
scruples
against
it.
and
he
--
he'd
--
of
course
he'd
said
that
he
raised
the
question
of
constitutionality
and
the
jurisdiction.
but
he
said
his
motive
in
refusing
to
answer
about
other
people
was
that
he
had
moral
scruples
about
the
--
informing
on
others.
he
said
that
repeatedly.
now,
he
didn't
say
that
--
he
didn't
make
the
specific
pertinency
objection
if
that's
what
your
honor's
--
justice
whittaker's
question
is.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
did.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
he
did.
he
said,
i
--
i
cannot
bring
myself
to
inform
on
other
people.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
yes.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
that's
right
sir.
we
--
we
say,
however,
that
the
motive
of
the
witness
--
the
motive
of
the
witness
isn't
controlling,
unless
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
unless
this
court
is
to
hold
back
without
a
specific
objection
on
pertinency
specifically
that
--
that
it's
never
necessary
to
have
the
subject
matter
appear
with
indisputable
clarity.
if
you're
to
hold
that,
we
have
no
argument
on
this
point.but
of
course
watkins
didn't
make
any
such
specific
objection.
it's
been
treated
as
if
it's
been
specific.
but
i
have
it
set
out
in
full
what
mr.
watkins
said
on
page
24
of
my
brief.
and
he
says
very
much
that
he
says,
i
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
inform
on
others.
and
then
he
does
go
on
after
it's
quite
a
long
thing
here.
that
he
says,
i
don't
believe
such
questions
are
relevant
to
the
work
of
this
committee
and
you
--
relevant
is
almost
equivalent
or
pertinent,"
but
he
didn't
make
a
formal
objection
and
certainly
deutch
did
not
either.
but
when
--
but
we
--
we
do
--
and
of
course
he
had
--
let
me
just
finish
this
part
about
--
about
what
he
had
without
the
objection.
he
had
no
opening
statement
because
what
they
said
in
chicago
six
months
before,
he
--
he's
not
aware
of
or
albany.
no
other
witnesses
were
heard.
and
unlike
the
--
particularly
the
wilkinson
and
braden
situation,
this
subcommittee
floats
ad
hoc
in
absolute
thin
air.
now,
i
don't
mean
in
the
sense
that
they
hadn't
been
authorized
to
take
testimony.
we
stipulated
that.
but
authorized
to
take
testimony
about
what?
there
is
no
resolution
passing
from
the
parent
committee
to
this
subcommittee,
not
a
vestige
in
the
record,
not
a
word
as
to
what
this
subcommittee,
and
remember
the
record
shows
that
they
never
heard
any
witness
on
the
other
subject
at
any
time,
at
any
place,
except
mr.
deutch
what
they
were
to
do.
now,
sir,
as
to
did
the
witness
raise
this
point,
we
say
if
he
has
to
say
pertinency,
he
didn't.
we
think
that
in
the
colloquy,
immediately
concerning
whether
he
should,
so
to
speak,
telling
other
people,
in
lay
language
in
--
i
set
that
forth
your
honor
in
this
page
and
half,
in
lay
language
he
in
effect
did
raise
this
point.
that's
on
page
26
and
all
the
way
and
down
through
27.
now,
it's
--
it's
raised
with
--
somewhat
awkwardly
perhaps.
and
the
government
keeps
saying,
well,
he
had
confident
counsel
by
his
side.
it's
very
flattering
to
me
but
i
didn't
know
anymore
about
the
pertinency
point
in
april
of
1954
than
the
people
who
wrote
the
watkins
brief
before
this
court
who
didn't
mention
it
three
years
later.
but
i
do
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
counsel,
you
know,
can't
make
any
objection.
he
cannot
be
heard
himself,
he
--
before
this
committee.
he
may
not
even
add
--
volunteer
to
advise
his
client
on
his
own
initiative.
he
must
wait
till
the
client
leads
towards
him
and
that
the
counsel
before
you
and
many
others
had
been
threatened
with
the
objection
for
even
presuming
to
volunteer
advice
when
it
was
not
solicited.
it's
a
matter
of
which
way
the
head
moves
and
that
was
count
--
was
commented
upon
by
dean
griswold,
your
honor
in
his
book
on
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
there
--
these
objections
26
and
27
that
mr.
deutch
made.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
i
think
it's
the
pertinency,
you
see
mr.
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
alright.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh,
yes.
that
was
objected
sir,
generally.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
in
the
very
outset.
after
that
first
question,
he
said
that
he
objected
and
took
issue
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
committee,
he
mentioned
601.
well,
the
reason
he
knew
about
that
was
--
of
course,
it
was
on
the
bottom
of
the
subpoena,
public
law
601
as
the
enabling
legislation.
and
then
he
said,
"under
protest
as
to
its
constitutionality,
i
will
answer,
yes
i
was
a
member.
i
am
no
longer
a
member.
but
then
he
comes
along
to
this
question
of
other
people
you
see.
at
26
he
says,
"i
am
perfectly
willing
to
tell
about
my
own
activities
but
do
you
feel
i
should
trade
my
moral
scruples
by
informing
on
someone
else?"
and
he
--
he
puts
at
--
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
this
is
that,
that
this
is
--
this
is
now
minor.
this
--
this
was
defunct.
isn't
that
in
as
a
lay
sense
saying,
"how
does
this
relate
to
--
to
information
which
the
nation
must
have
the
exigencies
of
national
security
require?"
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
didn't
accept
as
he
derived
from
the
questions.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir.
he
did
not.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
not
on
pertinency
ground
as
such.
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
no,
i
--
i'm
quite
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
quite
clear
he
did
not
raise.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
not
quite.
i
think
that
the
statement
on
26
and
27
is
that
kind
of
request
for
information
and
the
discretion
of
doubt
as
to
pertinency
in
lay
language
which
should
have
prompted
the
committee
to
make
some
explanation
and
that
the
committee
said
in
response
to
that
that
decision,
i
--
whether
he
should
answer
about
it
or
did
not
rest
with
you.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
see
your
honor.
i'm
placing
my
emphasis
on
the
phrase
of
the
chief
justice
in
the
watkins
case
when
he
says
after
discussing
the
pertinency
thing.
he
says,
this
is
a
jurisdictional
concept
of
pertinency."
and
--
and
i
think
that
it's
more
than
pertinency
in
the
mere
sense
of
relevancy.
it
relates
back
through
the
chain
of
pertinency
to
the
subject
and
then
pertinency
of
the
subject
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
however,
i
would
like
to
get
on
to
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
points
that
i
think
are
stronger.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
later
on
we
are
in
point
three.
as
to
the
names
of
others,
we
say
could
never
be
under
these
circumstances,
congress
--
the
information
was
congress
needs
to
legislate.
but
then,
your
honors
at
trial,
the
government
was
obviously
apprehensive
of
whether
or
not
a
student
group
at
cornell,
these
people
that
discussed
marxism
and
gave
out
leaflets,
wouldn't
be
specially
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
and
if
that
was
said
to
be
the
subject
matter.
so
what
they
did
was
to
prove
from
the
beginning
of
the
trial
to
the
end
that
the
subject
matter
wasn't
the
students
at
cornell
at
all.
that
it
was
investigation
of
labor
in
the
albany
area.
the
government's
opening
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
must
explain
this,
your
honor.
most
awkward
thing
if
your
honors
will
look,
i
believe,
in
the
front
page,
at
least
the
clerk
said
there
would
be
a
(inaudible)
and
by
mistake
several
hundred
pages
of
this
document
were
printed
in
error,
that's
not
evidence
at
all.
beyond
he
thinks
--
what
happened
was
that
the
government
counsel
at
trial
handed
out
a
pamphlet
which
contained
the
two
pages
he
won't
introduce
and
a
lot
of
other
material.
and
the
clerk
--
the
stenographer
in
the
district
court
wrote
on
it
in
government
exhibit
number
1
instead
of
saying
government
exhibit
number
1
pages
3,
4
and
5
only.
so
when
the
clerk
of
this
court
got
it,
the
whole
pamphlet
was
printed.
and
that,
of
course,
is
119
is
in
evidence
at
all.
that
shouldn't
be
printed.
it
was
an
error
only
as
printing
your
honor.
the
government
started
out
and
talked
about
albany
and
they
said
the
investigation
was
about
the
labor
leaf
of
youth
legal
and
break
many
matters
like
that.
none
of
which
were
touched
on
in
--
in
the
hearing.
they
put
in
government
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
number
1.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
no.
the
hearing,
when
i
use
the
word
hearing,
i
mean
hearing
as
distinguished
from
trial.
they
put
in
government's
exhibit
number
1
which
is
the
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
that
--
that
is
record
38
and
40.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
and
that
was
objected
to
and
it
was
admitted
to
show
this
subject
matter
and
only
for
that
purpose.
and
it
may
show
the
subject
matter.
if
it
does,
it
shows
that
the
subject
matter
was
albany
and
infiltration
in
the
albany
area.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
introduce
at
the
trial
your
honor.
the
hearing
just
consisted
of
these
questions
that
i
reviewed
about
the
communist
at
cornell
and
nothing
about
albany
or
labor
or
anything
like
that.
now,
a
trial
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
deutch's
testimony.
yes,
yes
indeed,
your
honor.
deutch's
testimony
is
the
government's
exhibit
number
5
and
it's
291
of
the
record.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir
and
that
gives
you
his
entire
testimony.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
now,
the
government
put
in
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
everything.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
291
your
honor
to
page
304.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
300
at
the
top
of
305,
excuse
me.
top
of
305.
that's
the
whole
thing.
that's
all
about
it.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh,
yes,
sir.
but
the
point
i'm
on
now
is
the
discrepancy
is
a
due
process
question
as
to
trial
because
the
government
--
trial
put
in
this
exhibit
number
1
that
deutch
had
never
seen
it
and
it
says
that
the
subject,
there's
labor
activities
in
the
albany
area.
exhibit
number
2
is
the
chicago
hearing,
the
one
which
was
used
in
the
watkins
case
to
prove
that
the
investigation
was
in
the
labor.government
exhibit
number
3
says
that
it's
an
investigation
of
labor.
and
these
your
honors,
if
your
honors
please,
were
all
different
subcommittees
in
the
ones
that
heard
deutch
but
they're
same
subcommittees.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
over
objection
and
trial.
for
what
purpose?
to
show
what
the
subject
matter
was.
because
at
first,
the
government
has
to
prove
a
subject
first
before
they
can
show
anything
is
pertinent
to
it.
and
--
then
the
next
point
was
the
testimony
of
a
man
named
marqusee
about
how
he
got
recruited
into
the
ue
he
being
a
student
at
cornell
and
--
and
the
only
trouble
that
is
that
they
never
asked
mr.
deutch
about
marqusee,
and
marqusee
never
--
when
he
testified,
never
mentioned
mr.
deutch
so
there's
no
connection
there.
then
mr.
tavenner
takes
the
stand.
that's
the
--
they're
the
only
three
exhibits
that
tend
to
approach
subject
and
they're
introduced
for
that
purpose.
mr.
tavernner
committee
counsel
takes
a
stand
and
the
government
says
to
him,
well,
"how
is
it?
if
the
subject
matter
is
albany,
how
is
it
that
when
this
committee
print
came
out
--
the
little
print
of
the
committee
prints
at
the
house
committee
of
--
of
mr.
deutch's
testimony.
it
says
at
the
top
education
part
a.
we
said,
"oh
well,
the
clerk
put
that
on
as
a
matter
of
convenience."
well,
i
said,
was
there
a
connection
between
albany
and
mr.
deutch's
hearing?"
and
mr.
tavenner
said,
yes,
there
was,
but
he
didn't
say
ever
what
it
was.
he
talked
again
about
infiltration
of
this
--
connected
he
planned
about
birmingham
--
binghamton,
about
the
--
the
practice
as
he
said
that
concern
the
committee
and
this
was
the
closest
he
came.
he
said
there
was
a
practice
we
found
or
we
thought
there
might
be
where
certain
students
in
the
industrial
relation
school
at
cornell
took
summer
jobs
and
in
that
way,
they
get
into
the
ue.
and
the
committee
wanted
to
find
out
about
that.
well,
if
they
did,
they
didn't
ever
ask
deutch
about
it.
there's
not
a
word
in
his
hearing
and
justice
douglas
at
--
i
mean
again
the
hearing
before
the
committee
not
a
word
do
they
advert
to
marqusee
or
the
industrial
relations
school
or
labor
unions
or
labor
and
anything
else.
it's
only
that
material
about
the
students.
and
the
government
maintained
this
position
throughout
until
barenblatt
came
down.
when
this
court
found
that
the
academic
community
was
not
a
privilege
sanctuary
had
no
particular
higher
first
amendment
status
or
anything
else,
the
government
(inaudible)
and
they
said,
"well,
it's
obvious
the
subject
matters
in
the
cornell
that
you
can
see
that
by
simply
reading
the
hearing."
now,
i
think
maybe
the
subject
matter
was
cornell.
i
think
the
witness
would
lean
that
as
the
hearing
went
on.
i
think
we
require
more
than
that
but
my
point
now
is
that
section
--
title
2192
does
not
punish
or
contempt
--
refuse
to
answer.
it
punishes
only
a
refusal
to
answer
a
question
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry.
there
must,
therefore,
be
proved
that
trial
a
subject.
it's
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
and
we
have
a
right
to
have
the
subject
proved
which
is
one,
which
corresponds
to
the
facts
of
the
hearing
and
at
trial
because
we
have
to
decide
whether
they're
cross-examined.
i
didn't
cross-examine
mr.
tavenner
because
he'd
been
busy
proving
that
the
subject
was
labor
infiltration
in
the
albany
area
and
i
knew
that
--
that
you
could
look
at
the
hearing
to
your
heart's
content,
you
never
see
a
single
question
about
that.
and
the
defendant
might
have
taken
the
stand
or
the
argument
might
have
been
made.
in
fact,
in
--
in
my
closing
i
renounce
the
right.
i
said,
if
the
government
had
tried
to
prove
or
had
offered
proof
that
the
subject
was
cornell
then
i
would
have
made
the
kind
of
argument
appropriate
to
that
proof.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
but
if
they
did
not
make
that
argument
and
they
made
an
entirely
different
subject,
not
this
subject
up
in
albany,
and
i
might
say
parenthetically,
the
government
still
entertains
the
--
being
hoped
that
it
will
be
found
that
if
it
is
in
the
albany
area,
but
if
it
is
washington
is
in
the
philadelphia
area
because
it's
further
away
between
the
two
points
and
i
think
that's
quite
clear.
i
mean
there's
a
separate
area
of
--
of
labor
interest
up
there
(inaudible)
and
being
disconnectedly.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
excuse
me.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
we
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
we
didn't
say
that.
we
don't
contend
that,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir
we
do
not
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
that's
correct.
now,
your
honor
our
conclusion
on
that
point
is
that
due
process
requires
that
the
defendant
have
a
chance
to
meet
the
proof
of
every
essential
element
at
the
trial
not
on
appeal.
we've
cited
the
cases
which
we
think
they're
in
analogous
where
particularly
the
case,
the
murder
case
in
which
evidence
was
admitted,
and
then
it
said,
well,
it
could
have
been
admitted
for
a
different
purpose
on
appeal.
but
we
had
a
right
to
be
contrived
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
hearing
and
not
have
some
other
subject
matter
contrive
to
which
it
was
never
mentioned
at
the
hearing
at
all.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
subject
matter
has
to
be
proved
at
trial
as
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
because
the
statute
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
beg
it
differently,
your
honor.
sir,
i
do
not
think
that's
the
offense.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
the
offense
i
think
is
confusing
answer.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
it's
still
102
sir,
192,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
with
all
due
respect
it
says,
to
refuse
to
answer
questions
pertinent
to
this
subject
under
inquiry.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
and
the
government
has
to
prove
it
at
trial.
and
they
have
to
prove
at
trial
whether
they're
objected
to
it
or
not
because
it's
an
element
of
the
crime.
if
a
statute
says
burglary,
it's
the
breaking
and
entering
of
a
house
in
the
night
time
and
the
witness
doesn't
have
to
say,
well,
i
object
they
go
about
night
time.
the
government
has
to
prove
that
it
was
night
time.
and
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
say
and
so
in
trial
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
and
it
proved
to
trial
that
the
subject
matter
on
their
decree
was
the
investigation
of
labor
activities
in
the
albany
area.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
your
honor,
this
part
of
the
case
is
--
is
totally
aside
from
the
watkins
point
of
objecting
the
pertinency.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
it
should
have
been
(voice
overlap)
out.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
because
the
government
has
to
prove
it
whether
we
object
to
it
or
not.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
so
i
didn't
say
to
you
your
honor.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
of
course,
there
was
some
subject
but
what's
the
situation
when
the
government
proves
a
subject
at
trial
as
an
element
of
a
case
which
is
in
fact
contradiction
to
the
actual
subject
matter
of
the
hearing.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
your
honor,
there
would
be
a
subject
matter
whether
objections
were
made
or
not,
i
think.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
we
are
in
extricable
in
conflict
on
this
point
your
honor.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
my
third
point,
if
i
may,
the
one
is
that
in
this
context
of
hearing
where
the
witness
has
disclosed
to
the
committee
so
much
and
all
in
fact
of
a
general
nature
or
a
specific
nature,
all
except
names
along.
under
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
watkins
reinforced
in
barenblatt
where
it's
been
held
in
traditional
view
that
these
committees
are
restricted
to
acquiring
that
certain
data
which
congress
needs
in
order
to
legislate
that
the
names
per
se
of
witnesses
could
not
be
pursuant
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
now,
we
don't
say
that
this
could
never
be
true
in
a
congressional
investigation.
it
might
be,
for
instance,
particularly
in
investigation
of
government
itself
but
where
the
investigation
is
--
has
into
--
in
a
field
like
this
and
where
the
witness
has
disclosed
these
broad
aspects
could
names
themselves
be
legislative
data.
the
legislative
function
as
court
has
said
is
certainly
not
exposure
so
they
could
not
have
wanted
them
for
that
reason.
they're
not
--
the
legislative
branch
is
not
on
the
business
of
compiling
dossiers
of
people
or
finding
who's
been
guilty
of
wrong
doing
or
wrong
thinking.
this
is
reserve
to
other
branches
of
the
government.
they
could
hardly
legislate
in
the
sense
with
respect
to
particular
persons
and
without
running
a
file
of
the
bill
of
attainder
provisions.
and
we
think
therefore
under
the
document
of
separation
of
powers,
it
would
be
hard
to
see
how
the
names
alone
would
be
necessary
to
the
congress
in
order
to
intelligently
cope
with
the
problem
of
--
of
communism,
the
problem
that
they
have
before
them.
they
must
know,
of
course,
the
general
size,
quality,
shape,
scope,
the
actions
of
the
--
of
the
--
if
you
will,
the
communist
even
at
cornell
and
all
of
this
they
got
and
could
have
gotten
as
much
as
they
wanted
to
presumably,
the
witness
didn't
cut
off
the
inquiry,
it
--
as
it
happened
in
other
cases,
it
was
only
the
names.
and
we
therefore,
our
third
point
is
that
the
requirements
of
this
court
with
respect
to
saying
that
committees
are
restricted
to
that
data
which
congress
the
parent
body
needs
to
cope
with
an
existing
legislative
problem
at
a
law
enforcement
problem
but
a
legislative
problem
would
not
justify
the
seeking
of
names
by
compulsory
process.
now,
my
last
point
your
honor
which
is
the
first
amendment
point,
in
which
we
take
not
the
absolute
but
the
relative
position
announced
most
especially
by
this
court
in
the
barenblatt
case.
we
say
that
to
sustain
this
conviction
in
this
case
in
the
light
of
that
balancing
test
is
to
go
further
than
any
case
has
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
so
far
that
it
would
be
hard
to
conceive
of
a
case
in
which
the
first
amendment
rights
might
up
way
the
investigative
power.
now,
this
court
has
recognized
the
very
real
deterrent
to
political
association
with
under
orthodox
groups
involved
in
the
prospect
that
those
associating
with
such
a
group
may
later
be
called
before
congressional
committee
and
have
to
own
up
to
it.
this
is
the
reason
the
first
amendment
gets
in
to
these
cases.
now,
parenthetically,
the
government
has
said,
"well,
deutch
didn't
plead
the
first
amendment."
well,
i
--
i
submit
that
it
is
quite
noble.
the
first
amendment
is
not
like
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
i
don't
know
what
they
mean
by
pleading
the
first
amendment.
it
is
efficient
on
government
if
it
has
been
transgressed
by
government,
no
process
can
follow
from
it.
and
i
apprehend
when
hundreds
of
first
amendment
cases
nobody
ever
plot
it
when
jehovah
witness,
for
instance,
was
arrested
for
having
no
license
to
sell
handbills
from
door-to-door.
i
don't
suppose
it
was
inquired
as
to
whether
or
not
he
said
to
the
county
clerk
in
the
courthouse
when
he
didn't
get
his
license
that
he
was
pleading
the
first
amendment.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
pled
as
novel
in
the
law.
but
they
then
say,
"but
this
man
is
actually
trying
to
invoke
the
first
amendment
rights
of
other
people."
well,
let
it
be
clear
that
we
are
here
invoking
the
first
amendment
rights
of
this
particular
defendant
and
not
others
and
we
do
it
in
the
same
way
as
the
deterrent
effect
has
been
spoken
up.
and
we
say
that
if
it's
a
deterrent
to
association
with
heretical
movements
or
an
orthodox
movement
that
you
may
have
to
admit
your
own
membership
how
much
greater
deterrent
it
is
for
a
man
of
decency
to
know
that
he
may
also
have
to
tell
about
the
association
with
that
movement
of
others
and
thus
bring
upon
them
the
same
dilemma
which
he
then
finds
himself
in.
because
many
men,
who
i
say,
with
impurity
would
dare
to
join
such
movements
knowing
that
he
might
have
to
someday
answer
to
it,
would
hesitate
to
do
so
if
he
also
has
to
answer
as
to
others.
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
it
isn't
the
first
amendment
rights
of
others.
it's
the
first
amendment
rights
of
this
witness.
now,
as
to
his
first
amendment
rights,
this
court
has
said
that
in
many
instances,
they
--
the
recognize
that
in
many
instances
but
not
at
all,
some
circumstances
they
have
said
the
first
amendment,
this
is
barenblatt,
protects
an
individual
from
being
compelled
to
disclose
association
or
relationship.
and
then
the
court
said
however,
this
is
barenblatt
he
quotes,
where
first
amendment
rights
are
asserted
to
bar
governmental
interrogation
resolution
of
the
issue
always
involved
a
balancing
by
the
court
of
the
competing
private
and
public
interest
at
stake
in
a
particular
circumstances
shown."
i
say
that
nobody
--
no
previous
court
has
ever
done
that
balancing
test.
they
simply
say,
"well,
these
questions
are
about
communism
or
this
man
was
a
communist
at
one
time."
and
that's
really
essential
to
government's
position
today.
how
do
they
meet
the
balancing
test?
they
meet
the
balancing
test
by
saying,
well,
we're
an
area
of
communist
investigation.
now,
it's
true.
this
court
has,
since
cio
against
douds,
permitted
governmental
action
with
respect
to
communist
and
the
communist
party
which
would
not
be
permitted
except
for
special
and
unique
attributes
of
that
party
to
wit
through.
one
that
although
it
was
a
political
party
in
some
respects,
it
shades
off
into
a
conspiracy.
secondly
that
among
tenants
which
are
merely
collectible,
unpopular
or
an
orthodox,
there
is
the
tenant
of
force
and
violence
of
the
government
--
overthrow
the
government.
and
this
court
from
cio
against
douds,
the
parent
--
the
braden
last
week
has
said
repeatedly
that
it
this
particular
horror
which
has
justified
in
this
case
interrogation
but
there
are
other
things
which
would
not
be
permitted
where
it
not
for
the
need
for
congress
be
informed
about
this
particular
doctrine
because
of
the
importance
of
national
security
and
self-preservation.
now,
in
many
other
cases,
intermediate
steps
such
as,
were
you
a
communist?
the
witness
himself
refuses
to
answer
or
other
such
questions
have
been
justified
as
being
witness
having
to
compel
to
answer
because
this
court
has
said,
well,
these
are
preliminary
to
get
on
to
this
question
and
to
find
out
about
force
and
violence.
what
happens
where
the
witness
takes
them
--
takes
the
committee
right
in
to
the
--
to
the
midst
of
the
--
of
the
secret
labyrinth
and
he
talks
about
force
and
violence.
he's
disclosed
all
he
knows
about
force
and
violence.
and
if
your
honors
will
bear
in
mind,
he
was
under
oath,
he
was
subject
of
course
to
the
pains
and
penalties
of
perjury
and
surely
this
committee
had
no
affection
for
him,
a
reason
to
protect
him
and
--
at
trial.
the
government,
if
these
were
not
true
had
available
to
them.
his
boss
in
the
party,
an
fbi
employee,
mr.
ross
ferguson
who
could
have
come
in
if
this
isn't
true.
and
i
submit
that
it
must
be
accepted
on
this
record
that
this
witness
has
said
all
he
knows
about
force
and
violence
which
is
this
group
of
student
that
he
was
involved
with
didn't
believe
in
it
and
as
he
said
nobody
ever
advocated
in
my
presence
and
if
they
had,
i
would
not
have
permitted
it.
and
he
then
tells
the
committee
upon
questioning,
of
course,
he
doesn't
know
what
the
motives
of
the
top
leaders
of
the
party
is.
well,
he's
a
witness.
that's
all.
and
if
doesn't
know,
he's
exhausted.
now,
i
say
therefore
to
the
court
that
it
would
have
the
tail
wagging
the
dog
if
you
could
have
the
witness
who
comes
all
the
way
to
the
question
of
force
and
violence
and
deals
with
it
and
this
is
unique
in
this
case,
your
honor.
this
has
never
construe
of
any
of
this
contempt
of
congress
cases
that
have
reached
this
court,
and
i
--
i
don't
know
of
no
others
whether
even
those
aren't
here
yet.
that
whether
the
witness
talks
about
force
and
violence
and
that
that
is
the
information
which
the
committees
must
need
to
know
about
which
justifies
what
would
otherwise
be
infringement
of
political
association
rights,
then
i
submit
that
that
justification
ceases
to
exist.
aside
from
that,
however,
aside
from
this
unique
feature
of
the
case,
just
in
the
general
balancing
as
the
court
said
should
be
done
in
barenblatt,
the
weighing
between
the
need
for
congress
to
know
and
to
get
data
necessary
to
legislate
and
the
admitted
infringement
of
first
amendment
rights
inherent
in
the
process
of
compulsory
testimony,
where
could
we
--
and
this
court
has
said
that
if
the
balance
still
to
a
certain
way,
it
will
tilt
in
favor
of
the
first
amendment.
they
--
the
six
scales
are
supposedly
are
indeed
running
--
running
free.
there
may
be
--
must
be
some
cases
where
the
first
amendment
will
prevail
over
the
investigative
power,
how
can
we
get
one
that
in
which
the
need
for
the
government
to
know
the
connection
with
national
security,
the
importance
of
the
information
that
conceivably
could
be
here,
could
possibly
be
less
in
proportion
to
the
first
amendment
rights.
and
both
sides
of
the
scale
i
say
this
case
weighs
higher.
first,
we
must
have
the
preservation
and
i'm
not
saying
again
that
there
is
a
privilege
sanctuary
but
if
first
amendment
rights
stand
high,
they
certainly
must
stand
high
with
the
student
on
a
college
campus
more
than
even
the
professor
because
he
is
a
student
on
a
college
campus.
if
they
--
if
he
doesn't
have
them
the
rights
to
be
wrong
if
you
will,
the
rights
to
make
it
jack
ass
out
of
himself
in
terms
of
joining
this
kind
of
a
party
at
age
of
19
and
getting
out
at
22
or
23.
if
he
doesn't
have
them
in
this
context
and
i
suggest
we
won't
find
anyone
whose
rights
in
terms
of
communism
will
rise
very
much
higher
than
this
from
the
standpoint
of
the
first
amendment
and
i
suggest
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
scale,
how
can
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
congress
and
all
his
majesty
be
impeded
by
not
knowing
the
name
of
the
student
who
asked
towards
the
age
or
18
or
19
to
join
the
communist
party
or
the
man
that
gave
the
$100.00.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
yes
your
honor.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
your
honor,
the
court
procedure
and
there
are
many
contexts,
citizens
duty
to
give
evidence.
he
is
called
under
all
sorts
of
rules,
we
know
the
relevancy.
he
has
the
protection
of
that.
but
here,
your
honor,
the
investigative
power
of
congress
is
derivative
only
in
the
first
place.
it
only
is
the
aide
of
legislation.
it
isn't
part
of
the
judicial
process.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
so
i
think
i
can
answer
that
sir
i
believe
i
can.
it's
because
i
apprehend
that
it
is
not
the
law
and
unlike
the
situation
here
is
recently
announced
by
this
court
that
there's
any
balancing
tests
to
the
witness
from
the
witness
stand.
you
see
this
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
your
honor,
i'm
relying
on
the
balancing
test
as
enumerated
by
this
court
the
majority
therefore
in
the
barenblatt
case
in
which
this
court
say
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
first
amendment
protects
an
individual
before
congressional
committee
from
being
compelled
to
disclose
to
the
association
or
relationships.
the
court
then
went
on
and
said
where
first
amendment
rights
are
asserted
before
governmental
interrogation,
resolution
of
the
issue
always
involves
a
balancing
by
the
courts
of
the
competing
private
and
public
interest
at
stake
and
the
particular
circumstance
is
shown.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
and
that's
what
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
of
course
it
applies,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
your
honor
if
--
if
he
raises
in
the
court
of
law,
he
gets
a
ruling
by
a
judge
that
it's
either
relevant
or
it
isn't
irrelevant.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
he
got
a
ruling
and
we're
here
asking
this
court
to
overturn
it.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
there
are
circumstances
in
which
it's
conceivable.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
--
i
should
think
it
would
be
most
and
much
less
likely
the
court
with
relevancy
rules
and
with
the
--
with
the
witness
being
called
to
testify
to
something
that's
specific
but
i
supposed
we
could
think
of
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
it
might
be
that
the
witness
in
court
would
refuse.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
it
is
not
the
question.
when
i
said
that
that
making
a
jack
ass
of
out
of
himself,
i'm
just
--
i
use
that
expression
in
the
sense
that
if
the
first
amendment
rights
a
behest
first
amendment
rights,
i'm
suggesting
that
as
a
student
in
the
university,
in
terms
particularly
a
political
things
that
he
certainly
has
that
element
of
first
amendment
rights
which
this
court
has
shown
in
the
past
a
certain
solicit
to
--
to
protect
the
right
of
inquiry.
your
honors
opinion
on
the
swizzie
case,
i
think
dwell
upon
that
at
concurring
opinion
at
some
length,
the
--
the
importance
of
the
academic
community
and
the
terms
of
the
first
amendment
unless
i
misread
the
opinion.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
alright,
sir.
i'll
--
i'll
accept
to
argue
and
that
there's
no
difference.
but
i
still
--
there
being
no
difference,
i
still
maintain
your
honor
that
when
they
ask
questions
here
and
had
gotten
all
of
the
information
that
they
did
get
but
then
to
say
that
the
names
are
necessary
in
the
first
place,
is
not
pursuant
to
valid
legislative
purpose
and
i
secondly
say
your
honor,
that
i
am
throwing
away
the
absolute
position
that
they
don't
have
any
right
to
asked
these
questions
in
this
field
at
all
because
this
court
has
informed
me
so
to
speak
by
a
series
of
five
or
five
decisions
that
that
is
not
the
law.
but
they
have
said
that
the
law
is
that
the
courts
will
and
they
said
must
balance
the
first
amendment
rights
in
the
degree
of
infringement
thereof
in
each
of
these
instances.
it's
what
said
in
the
barenblatt
case,
in
each
case
against
the
need
of
the
congress
and
the
public
need
to
know.
and
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
if
there's
ever
going
to
be
a
case
in
which
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
witness
be
the
same
or
different
or
lower
or
higher
than
he
might
have
in
the
court
or
to
prevail
over
the
investigative
power,
i
think
this
if
is
certainly
the
strongest
one
that
is
yet
reach
this
court
and
i
submit
that
it
is
a
strong
and
one
perhaps
is
--
is
likely
to
transpire.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir,
not
quite.
in
this
sense,
this
court
has
said
what
it
is
that
the
committee's
need
to
know
which
justifies
what
would
otherwise
be
an
infringement
of
the
first
amendment
namely
this
the
--
this
--
our
key
and
aspect
of
the
conspiracy,
the
doctrine
of
force
and
violence.
and
this
court
has
said
that.
this
court
from
--
from
the
cio
against
douds
case
on
has
repeatedly
said
it
is
only
because
this
isn't
just
a
political
party,
this
court
is
not
lying.
this
court
knows
that
it's
more
than
a
political
party.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
your
honor,
they
could
have
all
kinds
of
opportunities
to
--
the
record
stands
--
they
could
have
brought
ross
richardson
at
the
trial
if
that
isn't
true.
they
--
they
had
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
if
your
honor
means
that
we
do
not
accept
this
true,
mr.
deutch's
statement
that
now
the
people
he
knew,
believed
in
force
and
violence.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
accepted
your
honor
as
even
that
he
doesn't
know
all
he
knows.
but
contempt
of
congress
is
in
essence
to
withholding
of
information
and
he
couldn't
give
them
information
he
didn't
know
about
whether
he's
wrong
or
right,
he
is
exhausted
his
knowledge
on
the
subject.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
--
that
indeed
he
has
but
if
again,
there
are
cases
and
i
submit
that
there
are
barenblatt
is
one
of
them,
there
are
number
of
the
cases,
your
honor
in
which
the
questions
as
to
identities,
in
this
case
of
the
witness
whether
he
was
a
communist
having
justified
because,
as
i
believe,
he
just
steps
in
order
to
get
to
this
question
of
force
and
violence.
this
witness
went
all
the
way
to
force
and
violence.
and
looking
for
the
steps
on
the
way
is
i
think
to
have
the
tail
wagging
the
dog,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
the
question
to
me
at
the
outset
of
my
argument
yesterday.
i
(inaudible)
to
look
in
the
library
this
morning
and
i
regret
to
say
that
i
come
to
the
same
conclusion
as
mr.
maroney,
sir.
mr.
maroney
has
said
that
this
committee
basically
and
he
read
mr.
tavenner's
remarks,
was
interested
in
pursuing
and
how
does
it
subject
to
the
interrelationship
between
the
labor
union
infiltration
on
the
one
hand
and
the
communist
on
the
cornell
campus
on
the
other.
that
having
taken
place
by
--
of
this
practice
of
summer
--
taking
of
summer
jobs.
the
man,
marqusee,
did
that
if
you
may
recall.
and
it's
curious
to
me
that
if
that's
the
subject,
then
that's
what
the
committee
was
interested
in
that
they
never
asked
mr.
deutch
anything
about
that
practice.
now,
repeatedly
it's
this
--
practice
is
used
as
a
link
to
link
together
the
subject
matter
of
the
hearing.
and
i'm
assuming
now
arguendo
that
reading
the
question
discloses
that
the
committee
is
asking
a
series
of
questions
about
cornell
and
obviously,
even
in
the
grammatical
sense,
a
question
must
have
a
subject
matter,
of
course,
he
knows
when
they
say
to
him,
“what
was
the
source
of
the
$100
contribution
that
the
committee
member
or
the
committee
counsel
is
interested
in
and
the
subject
to
that
is
the
$100
contribution.
if
that's
what's
subject
matter
means
in
the
statute
is
or
in
this
court's
decision,
it
means
nothing.
it
would
only
bar
an
inquiry
which
was
conducted
by
in
--
by
madman
who
couldn't
frame
sentences.
it
must
mean
more
than
that.
now,
the
government
had
not
addressed
itself
to
a
much
more
basic
problem
in
dichotomy
in
this
case
in
the
subject
area,
then
whether
or
not,
he
made
a
pertinency
objection.
and
that
is
the
striking
contradiction
between
proof
at
trial
and
subject
matter
at
looking
at
the
hearing.
now
they
say,
oh,
there
was
a
link
between
--
between
the
proofs.
what
was
proof
of
trial
--
proof
of
trial
concerned
all
of
these
questions
of
the
infiltration
of
labor
in
the
albany
area
and
the
labor
youth
league
and
all
such
matters.
and
--
and
the
subject
as
it
developed
by
questions
of
the
hearing
and
i'm
not
speaking
now
whether
witness
was
aware
of
the
subject
or
not,
let's
assume
he
was
totally
aware
of
it,
it
was
totally
the
graduate
group
of
cornell.
and
the
link
is
this
practice
of
taking
summer
jobs.
the
only
connection
is
this
one
thing
and
this
was
never
asked
mr.
deutch,
whatsoever.
now,
if
they
had
been
interested
in
that
--
that
was
their
subject.
one
will
assume
that
they
were
back
in
(inaudible)
or
asking
if
he
knew
mr.
marqusee
and
did
mr.
marqusee
takes
such
a
job
or
were
you
ever
connected
with
the
labor
youth
league
or
some
questions
in
that
field,
there's
something
about
labor,
but
the
record
of
mr.
deutch's
hearing
before
the
committee
is
totally
devoid
of
any
references
to
these
matters
which
were
later
introduced
at
trial
is
being
the
subject.
i'd
submit
that
the
government
in
no
way,
even
addressed
itself
a
--
a
point
to
so,
i
think
is
the
dilemma
in
sustaining
this
conviction
from
the
standpoint
of
ordinary
due
process
and
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
have
proved
at
trial,
the
elements
of
the
crime.
and
not
to
have
them
changed
on
appeal
or
the
subject
matter
changed.
the
government
proved
to
the
hilt
the
subject
of
cornell,
i
mean
of
albany
and
labor
and
--
and
not
the
subject
that
was
actually
the
one.
and
as
i
say,
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
they
did
it
because
they
were
concerned
with
the
first
amendment
risks
so
to
speak
of
settling
right
down
in
cornell.
and
as
soon
as
mr.
barenblatt
came
along,
they
would
--
had
less
concern.
and
now
they're
--
they're
were
in
cornell
or
at
least,
the
link
between
the
two,
but
even
if
it's
the
link
between
the
two,
nobody
asked
him
about
that.
didn't
asked
about
the
interplay
and
these
are
all
questions
that
--
that
they
did
not
ask.
now,
i'd
like
to
say,
i
just
like
to
say
parenthetically,
what
i
said
about
this
is
just,
so
the
court
won't
misunderstand.
what
i
said
was
that
when
he
came
into
this
hearing
room
in
washington,
he
walked
in
and
i
said
he
knew
two
things.
he
had
a
subpoena
on
his
hand
and
he
read
the
paper
that
richardson
had
named
him.
and
that
he
came
before
an
unidentified
man
and
then
he
was
sworn.
i
didn't
say
they
were
unidentified
from
then
on,
but
if
you'll
look
at
the
record,
he
--
he
was
sworn,
just
a
small
point,
but
i
don't
want
the
court
to
think
that
i
misled
them.
they
were
totally
unidentified
until
he
was
sworn
and
the
question
commenced.
and
they
turned
out
to
be
the
three
congressmen
that
they
were
indentified
in
the
record.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
your
honor,
i
want
to
be
accurate,
it's
in
the
footnote
of
my
brief
and
that
therefore
i
will
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
look
again.
it's
100
and
--
it's
further
than
new
york
from
washington,
i
mean
it
isn't
--
you
can't
solve
it
by
saying
ithaca
i
think
is
in
the
albany
area.
i
think
that's
quite
clear
that
would
put
philadelphia
in
the
new
york
area
and
washington
in
the
philadelphia
area.
it's
almost
2
--
200
miles,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
why
you
can't
find
that.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
but
it
is
in
the
brief
and
--
oh,
yes,
sir,
150
miles
to
the
east
of
the
--
of
albany.
it's
a
separate
distinct
albany
area
and
i
can
see
that
the
committee
be
interested
and
it's
like
its
industrial
complex
there,
with
a
lot
of
electrical
industry.
albany
is
connected
to
detroit,
the
whole
area
and
you
can
read
a
lot
of
this
--
a
lot
of
this
material.
in
fact
a
lot
of
it
that
got
printed
by
mistake
in
the
record.
it
--
it's
all
about
this
labor
union
infiltration
there.
and
had
vest
this
cornell
thing
was
a
frolic,
even
if
it
was
interesting
to
the
committee
because
--
and
the
government
never
covered
this
point.
this
committee
never
existed
according
to
the
record
to
take
any
other
testimony,
it's
a
different
subcommittee.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
quite
agree.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
quite
agree,
your
honor.
it's
just
that
they
prove
that
you
see
a
trial,
i
would
be
the
first
to
agree
with
you
that
there's
no
magic
in
--
in
that.
but
i
think
there's
some
magic
in
it
when
they
prove
it
as
a
subject
that
then
becomes
a
discrete
thing
and
that
it
contradicts
what
happened
at
the
hearing.
but
i
--
i
didn't
want
to
touch
upon
one
further
point
which
seemed
to
me,
the
government
again
has
not
met
in
any
sense
and
that
is
the
dilemma
that's
created
by
reason
of
this
witness'
full
discussion
of
force
and
violence.
that
being
the
information
that
it
is
said
the
committee's
need
in
order
to
legislate
and
this
being
the
distinguishing
feature
which
permits
committees
to
go
into
what
would
otherwise
be
clearly
a
first
amendment-protected
political
activity.
and
it's
the
--
it's
the
government
that
suggested
this
to
this
court.
in
the
watkins
case,
this
court
said
i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
mention
this
yesterday,
that
in
the
watkins
case,
in
the
chief
justice's
opinion,
he
says
the
government
contends
that
the
public
interest
at
the
core
of
investigations
of
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
is
need
by
the
congress
to
be
informed
of
efforts
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
i
still
say
that
--
that
if
that
is
the
distinguishing
peculiarity
which
distinguishes
the
communist
party
and
its
treatment
before
the
law
and
it
must
be,
your
honors,
because
otherwise
this
court
won't
have
the
--
the
insulation
between
that
and
other
political
movements
who
merely
may
be
unpopular.
if
you
cut
yourselves
a
drift
from
this
particular
distinguishing
feature,
i
submit
that
it'll
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
limit
these
restraints
and
encroachments
on
the
first
amendment
in
favor
of
the
investigative
power,
because
that
distinguishing
feature
is
the
one
that
has
kept
it
from
lapping
over
into
other
fields.
now,
why
is
that
a
dilemma
in
this
case?
because
this
witness
took
the
committee
to
this
very
core.
he
took
them
where
this
court
has
always
said
they
were
entitled
to
go.
only
because
of
that
core
has
this
court
permitted
in
its
opinions
in
barenblatt
and
watkins,
it
said
it,
it
said
it
in
cio
against
douds
in
the
sense
of
all
of
these
cases.
this
--
they
said
--
you
have
said,
"while
this
court
sits
in
cio
against
douds,
we
will
not
permit
these
encroachments
which
we
here
permit
as
to
the
loyalty
oath
in
the
communist
party
to
be
extended,
it's
only
because
we
must
know,
we
must
be
informed,
we
must
protect
ourselves
about
the
problem
of
force
and
violence."
here,
the
witness
throughout
his
hearing,
he's
crossed-examined
on
it,
talks
to
the
committee
and
tells
them
freely
about
force
and
violence.
and
if
that's
true,
he
is
taking
them
where
they
have
been
allowed
to
go
in
balancing
encroachment
against
the
first
amendment.
and
how
can
we
then
justify
being
--
requiring
compulsory
testimony
which
would
infringe
the
first
amendment,
when
they
are
only
preliminary.
mr.
maroney
himself
said,
“oh
well,
this
question
is
preliminary
to
the
committee
gained
to
what
interests
them.”
well,
what
interests
them
according
to
the
government,
the
watkins
case
is
force
and
violence
and
this
witness
talked
again
and
again
about
force
and
violence.
he
was
crossed-examined
about
force
and
violence,
exhausted
his
knowledge
about
force
and
violence.
the
committee
was
satisfied
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
upper
(inaudible)
of
the
party
and
what
they
thought
about
force
and
violence,
he
was
talking
about
his
group.
and
it
ended
on
my
red
light,
sorry.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
my
thought
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
thank
you,
chief
justice.
my
thought
was
concluding
that
is
that
he
had
exhausted
all
of
the
information
he
had
on
that
core
which
has
justified
these
investigations.
