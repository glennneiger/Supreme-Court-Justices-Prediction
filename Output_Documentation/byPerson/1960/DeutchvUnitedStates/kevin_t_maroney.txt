mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
this
afternoon,
i
might
try
it
very
briefly
run
over
some
of
the
circumstances
which
let
up
to
the
petitioner's
being
subpoenaed
before
the
committee
and
his
appearance
before
the
committee.
now,
in
july
of
1953,
the
committee
--
house
committee
un-american
activities
began
a
general
investigation
of
communist
party
activities
in
the
albany
area.
mr.
tavenner,
the
committee
council
testified
at
the
trial
that
this
was
part
of
a
general
investigation
of
communist
activities
in
key
areas
throughout
the
united
states.
the
committee
suspended
him
after
a
few
days
taking
testimony.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
opening
statement
is
a
part
of
the
record.
the
opening
statement
at
the
july
1953
hearings
is
part
of
the
record
at
pages
--
beginning
at
page
38
and
going
over
to
page
40.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now
this
was
introduced
at
the
trial
your
honor
to
show
the
background.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
let
--
that's
right
at
the
trial.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
on
--
on
this
point,
your
honor
and
--
and
i
think
we'll
elaborate
on
it
tomorrow,
i
think
there
are
two
concepts
of
pertinency
which
we
--
we
have
to
deal
with
here
and
one
is
the
question
of
proof
of
actual
pertinency
at
the
trial
to
comply
with
the
statute,
which
is
a
--
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
question
asked
by
the
committee
was
within
the
power
granted
to
the
committee
to
investigate.
if
it's
an
appeal,
if
the
question
relates
to
appeal
that
has
been
assigned
to
the
committee
to
investigate
and
--
and
that
question
relates
to
the
appeal
then
i
think
the
government
had
shown
actual
pertinency.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
but
i
think
the
government
only
has
to
show
a
particular
topic
then
under
inquiry
aside
from
the
question
itself.
if
there
is
an
objection
on
the
ground
of
pertinency,
i
think
that's
what
the
decisions
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
think
it
does
have
to
prove
at
that
question.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
i
think
it's
a
question
of
whether
that
question
relates
to
a
topic
as
a
--
as
a
matter
of
law
which
hasn't
been
assigned
to
the
committee
as
being
within
the
power
of
the
committee
to
inquire
into
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
and
if
it
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
now,
in
--
in
this
particular
case,
these
hearings
of
which
this
hearing
was
--
was
bought
apart,
this
isn't
a
completely
separate
independent
hearing,
this
is
a
part.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
i
--
i
mean
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
his
--
that's
his
approach
to
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
i
--
i
don't
think
it
is
anymore
than
a
witness
appearing
in
a
courtroom
on
the
second
day
of
trial
and
being
asked
as
to
what
he
may
know
of
a
particular
case
can
just
separate
himself
from
the
overall
purposes
of
the
trial.
the
--
the
court
is
inquiring
into
guilt
or
innocence
perhaps
in
a
--
in
criminal
case.
as
far
as
a
particular
witness
is
concern,
it
maybe
only
asking
him,
"did
he
sell
the
murder
weapon
to
the
defendant?"
but
the
--
the
court
is
inquiring
into
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
committed
murder
perhaps.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there's
ample
evidence
here
of
pertinency
and
--
and
the
subject
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
under
inquiry.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
first
address
myself
to
the
problem
that
was
being
discussed
yesterday
afternoon,
and
i'll
try
to
state
our
legal
position
on
that
issue
and
then
if
i
can
state
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
it
will
demonstrate
that
the
problem
is
minimized
when
applied
to
the
facts
here.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
do
think
it
would
be
most
helpful
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
if
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
we
can
show,
your
honor,
from
--
from
the
record
here
that
the
albany
hearings
were
concerned
with
communism
in
education
and
communism
in
labor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
and
in
the
course
of
those
hearings,
it
developed
that
there
was
--
there
may
have
been
an
interrelationship
between
communism
at
cornell.
communist
infiltration
at
cornell
and
communism
in
labor
and
the
committee
was
pursuing
the
leads
that
it
had
to
that
effect.
those
leads
lead
directly
to
mr.
deutch.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
he
was
called
originally
to
appear
in
albany
in
connection
with
those
very
hearings.
now,
i
think
that
in
--
in
probably
10
or
15
minutes,
i
could
state
the
facts
of
this
record,
and
i
think
that
having
those
facts
in
mind,
it
is
a
much
simpler
task
to
apply
--
to
apply
the
facts
here
to
the
legal
problems
which
were
being
discussed
yesterday.so
that
i
would
prefer
to
proceed
that
way
and
i
think
it
would
be
most
helpful
with
--
unless
the
court
prefers
that
we
state
the
legal
position
first.
now,
in
july
1953,
the
committee
--
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
began
a
general
investigation
of
communist
activities
in
the
albany
area
as
well
as
in
certain
other
key
areas
in
the
united
states,
chicago
and
other
cities.
the
committee
conducted
hearings
in
albany
in
july
1953
for
several
days,
and
then
suspended
the
hearings.
now,
the
opening
statement
of
those
hearings
is
in
the
record
at
pages
38
to
40.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
is
at
albany.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
opening
statement
was
made
on
--
on
july
13,
1953
at
the
outset
of
those
hearings.
and
of
course,
the
--
the
committee
there
states
the
legislative
interest
of
the
committee
and
its
desire
to
investigate
communist
activities
when
--
within
the
albany
area.
that's
in
the
--
the
last
full
paragraph
on
that
page.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
page
39,
your
honor.
now,
that
last
paragraph
or
the
second
sentence
says
that
the
committee
decided
--
no.
“the
committee
in
its
course
of
investigation
came
into
possession
of
reliable
information
indicating
communist
party
activities
within
the
albany
area.
the
committee
decided
that
this
information
was
of
such
a
character
as
to
merit
an
investigation
to
determine
its
nature,
extent,
character
and
objects.”
and
for
that
reason,
they
had
commenced
these
hearings
in
albany
and
they
did
in
fact
conduct
hearings.
the
--
the
hearings
were
suspended
in
1953
and
in
november
of
1953,
the
committee
decided
that
it
would
resume
hearings
in
albany
which
it
did
the
following
april.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
april
of
1954,
yes,
sir.
now,
at
--
in
the
opening
statement
of
the
april
1954
hearings
which
appears
beginning
at
page
270,
270
of
the
record
and
at
the
top
--
near
the
top
of
page
271,
the
chairman
of
the
committee
announced
in
part
that
the
committee
on
un-american
activities
will
resume
this
morning,
the
investigation
of
communist
party
activities
within
the
capital
area,
referring
to
albany.
this
is
a
continuation
of
the
open
hearings
which
were
conducted
in
albany
between
july
13
and
16,
1953.
the
investigation
has
been
extended
to
adjacent
areas,
from
which
witnesses
are
also
expected
to
be
heard.
and
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
he
said,
“other
testimony
taken
at
1953
albany
hearings
related
to
the
efforts
of
the
communist
party
to
infiltrate
industry
and
other
segments
of
society
in
the
capital
area.”
testimony
now
to
be
heard
is
expected
to
supplement,
that
formally
given
on
this
subject
and
as
indicated,
will
extend
into
adjacent
areas.
he
--
he
then
went
on
to
refer
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
that
begins
at
the
bottom
of
page
271.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
and
extends
over
in
272.
and
in
--
about
the
middle
of
that
page
where
the
chairman
is
continuing,
he
states
that,
“this
committee
is
not
investigating
labor
unions,
but
is
investigating
communism
within
the
field
of
labor
where
it
has
substantial
evidence
that
it
exists.”
and
then
he
makes
reference
to
the
committee's
interest
in
view
of
h.r.
7487,
which
was
a
bill
which
would
have
dealt
with
the
subject
of
communist-dominated
labor
unions.
now,
another
reference
which
shows
committee's
interest
in
these
albany
hearings
can
be
seen
in
the
committee's
annual
report
for
1954,
which
is
also
part
of
the
record
and
which
appears
beginning
at
page
320,
where
on
page
325,
where
the
committee
is
summarizing
the
hearings
it
--
it
did
hold
in
april,
1954
at
albany.
at
the
page
--
at
the
top
of
page
325
taking
up
to
the
middle
of
the
sentence
referring
to
hearings
in
albany,
dealing
principally
with
communist
infiltration
of
vital
defense
industries
and
education
within
the
capital
area
and
throughout
the
state
of
new
york
and
adjacent
states.
so
that
the
evidence
here
in
the
--
in
the
committee
hearings
and
in
the
report
of
the
committee
on
those
hearings,
clearly
shows
that
the
committee
was
interested
in
communist
infiltration
into
labor
and
communist
infiltration
into
education.
now
in
addition,
during
the
albany
hearings
that
began
on
april
7,
two
witnesses
testified
concerning
they're
having
attended
cornell
university
and
concerning
they're
having
taking
summer
jobs
in
communist-dominated
labor
unions.
now,
in
that
connection
it
was
explained
that
one
of
these
witnesses
were
the
school
of
the
industrial
labor
and
relations
at
cornell
and
that
school
had
a
policy
of
requiring
each
student.
during
the
summers,
he
was
in
attendance
at
the
school
to
at
least
make
an
effort
to
spend
one
--
one
summer
working
with
--
with
a
management
group,
one
summer
with
a
union
group
and
one
summer
with
a
mediation
board.
now,
these
witnesses
testified
as
to
they're
having
attended
or
having
taking
summer
jobs
and
in
connection
with
those
jobs
in
--
which
were
connected
with
unions
having
been
engaged
in
communist
party
activities
and
then
continuing
to
engage
in
communist
party
activities
upon
there
return
to
the
cornell
campus.
one
of
the
witnesses,
emmanuel
ross
richardson
testified
before
the
committee,
i
think
on
april
the
8th.
and
he
stated
that
he
had
gone
into
the
ue
--
had
going
to
work
with
ue
union,
the
united
electrical
workers
at
the
general
electric
plant
in
1948
and
was
there
recruited
into
the
communist
party.
he
returned
to
the
cornell
in
the
fall
and
continued
in
the
communist
party
on
the
campus.
now,
richardson
also
testified
that
he
was
at
cornell
during
the
period
from
1950
to
1953.
that
after
he
was
recruited
into
the
party,
he
was
assigned
to
the
labor
youth
leg.
he
stated
that
there
was
a
graduate
group,
a
--
a
communist
cell
on
the
campus
composed
of
members
of
the
graduate
group
at
cornell.
he
identified
the
membership
of
this
group
as
being
the
petitioner
and
petitioner's
wife,
one
homer
owen
and
owen's
wife
and
a
mr.
marzac
and
his
wife.
he
also
testified
that
he
was
aware
of
only
one
member
of
the
faculty
at
cornell
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
then
he
didn't
know
the
identity
of
that
person,
that
the
petitioner
here
was
the
only
--
was
the
contact
man
for
the
communist
party
with
this
member
of
the
faculty
at
cornell.
richardson
also
testified
that
during
this
period
of
time,
1950
to
1953,
he
had
received
from
the
petitioner
a
$100
contribution
to
the
communist
party,
which
the
petitioner
had
received
from
a
source
which
was
unknown
to
richardson.
now,
because
of
this
information
furnished
by
richardson
and
by
the
other
witness
that
i
referred
to
marqusee
and
also
--
who
also
testified
before
the
committee
and
their
testimony
is
in
the
record,
and
also
because
of
information
furnished
to
the
committee
by
homer
owen,
in
conference
with
the
members
of
the
staff.
mr.
tavenner,
the
committee
counsel,
testified
at
the
trial
that
as
a
result
of
this
information,
the
committee
was
interested
in
determining
the
extent
of
the
--
of
the
possible
inter
--
interplay
between
communist
infiltration
into
education
and
communism
in
the
field
of
labor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
richardson
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
richardson
i
think
joined
the
communist
party
with
the
knowledge
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
the
other
witness,
marqusee,
i
don't
believe
did.
i
think
that
he
became
dissolution
with
the
party
and
--
and
testified
fully
before
the
committee.
now,
mr.
tavenner
testified
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
was
a
--
i
don't
know
if
he
was
paid,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
your
honor.
he
--
he
was
reporting
regularly
during
the
time
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
--
he
wouldn't
be
an
employee
in
the
usual
sense.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
mean
he
--
he
was
not
an
employee
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
as
such,
he
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
he
may
have
received
funds.
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i'd
say
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
the
record
shows
whether
he
got
paid
of
not,
i
--
i
--
it
would
be
the
usual
practice
that
he
would
at
least
get
reimbursed
expenses
that
he
--
he
might
have
been
incurred
in
connection
with
his
communist
party
activities
and
he
may
have
received
additional
sums.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
so
that
mr.
tavenner
testified
at
the
trial
here.
that
as
a
result
of
this
information
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
on
page
24,
your
honor.
that
have
been
furnished
by
richardson
and
marqusee
and
owen.
that
the
staff
had
--
this
is
near
the
top
of
the
page
that
witnessed
--
the
staff
had
ascertained
and
had
reported
to
the
committee
that
there
were
members
of
the
industrial
relations
department
of
the
university,
who
were
accepting
positions
with
some
labor
unions
which
had
been
--
which
were
by
our
own
testimony,
communist
controlled
and
it
was
the
investigation
of
that
matter
which
brought
this
matters
to
life.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
on
the
preceding
page
at
the
top
of
page
23,
he
stated,
“the
committee
was
desirous
in
ascertaining
to
what
extent,
any
of
those
students
leaving
on
the
summer
courses
were
influenced
to
select
the
communist
control
unions
for
the
purposes
of
their
summer
work.”
that
is
what
we
were
leading
to.
in
--
in
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
the
albany
hearings?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
might
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
might
explain
this,
your
honor.
the
albany
hearings
began
on
april
7
and
continued
through
april
8
and
9.
the
committee
did
not
learn
the
address
of
the
petitioner
until
april
6.
they
issued
a
subpoena
on
april
7
which
was
served
on
that
date
to
the
petitioner,
served
on
the
petitioner
on
that
date.
returnable
in
albany
on
april
the
9th,
in
other
words,
the
committee
subpoenaed
the
petitioner
to
come
to
albany
to
appear
at
these
very
hearings
on
april
9,
in
conjunction
with
the
subject
matter
of
those
hearings.
his
attorney
called
the
committee
counsel
upon
the
petitioner's
receiving
the
subpoena
and
asked
for
an
extension
so
that
he
could
study
the
case.
the
committee
counsel
agreed
to
an
extension
to
have
the
petitioner
appear
in
washington
on
april
the
12th.
in
other
words,
instead
of
appearing
friday
in
albany,
he
was
told
it
would
be
alright
if
he
appeared
on
monday
in
washington,
since
the
committee
was
leaving
albany
and
coming
back
to
washington.
now,
when
--
so
that
he
--
he
did
appear
on
that
date.
he
appeared
before
the
--
before
this
committee,
and
the
committee
announced
at
the
outset
who
the
chairman
was.
according
to
the
record,
on
--
beginning
on
page
292,
beginning
of
petitioner's
testimony
before
the
committee,
the
--
the
chairman
stated
after
saying,
“you
may
sit
down,
please.”
referring
to
the
petitioner
obviously
and
he
says,
“let
the
record
show
that
for
the
purpose
of
taking
this
testimony
this
morning,
pursuant
to
the
rules
of
this
committee,
the
chairman
has
appointed
the
subcommittee
consisting
of
messrs.
scherer,
doyle
and
jackson,
with
jackson
acting
as
chairman.
“are
you
ready
to
proceed
mr.
counsel?”
so
that
of
course
these
were
not
unidentified
members
of
the
committee
at
all.
they
were
identified
that
the
outset
to
the
petitioner.
petitioner
knew
that
he
had
been
subpoenaed
before
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
he
knew
that
he
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
in
conjunction
with
his
communist
activities.
he
--
he
knew,
he
admits
he
knew
in
his
brief
that
he
knew
of
ross
richardson's
having
testified
before
this
--
before
a
--
a
committee
in
albany,
at
hearings
where
he
originally
was
subpoenaed
to
attend.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it's
of
some
note
here
in
connection
with
the
argument
that
he
--
that
he
was
pulled
in
off
the
street
and
--
and
sat
before
three
unknown
men
without
any
explanation
that
it
was
the
petitioner
in
the
course
of
this
testimony,
who
first
mentioned
the
name
of
ross
richardson.
in
--
in
making
reference
on
page
295,
during
the
interrogation
and
after
he
had
refused
to
answer
some
of
the
questions,
on
295
in
the
middle,
mr.
deutch
says,
“the
committee
knows
who
ross
richardson's
statement
that
this
gentleman
had
quit
the
communist
party.”
so
that
the
committee
or
--
or
the
petitioner
wasn't
coming
into
this
--
this
hearing,
with
no
idea
of
what
the
area
of
interest
of
the
committee
was.i
think
he
had
a
very
definite
idea.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
--
as
petitioner
counsel
--
petitioner's
counsel
referred
to
yesterday.
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
after
he
answers
some
preliminary
questions
about
his
age
and
address,
and
so
forth,
education,
mr.
tavenner,
at
about
three
quarters
on
the
way
down
on
page
293,
explained
to
him
that
during
the
hearings
in
albany
last
week,
the
committee
had
received
information
to
the
effect
that
petitioner
was
involved
in
communist
party
activities
at
cornell
university,
that
if
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party
group
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
reading
this,
i
probably
would
do
better
to
do
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
if
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
group,
the
committee
would
like
to
ask
you
about
your
activities
there
at
cornell.
now,
the
petitioner
--
so
then
they
did,
they
say,
“were
you
a
member
of
a
group
of
the
communist
party
at
cornell?”
the
petitioner
at
the
outset
said,
“i
wished
to
register
a
challenge
as
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
committee
under
public
law
601,
which
is
the
committee's
enabling
legislation.”
petitioner
incidentally
was
accompanied
by
counsel
on
this
occasion.
now,
he
then
said,
“but
under
your
jurisdiction
as
stated,
i
answered,
yes,
i
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.”
then
mr.
tavenner
said,
the
committee
was
advised
--
no,
i
--
i
seem
to
have
been
wrong
on
my
statement
that
he
was
the
first
one
to
bring
in
the
name
of
ross
richardson
into
the
hearings,
because
he
was
--
he
was
so
advised
of
richardson's
testimony.
he
does
however
concede
in
his
brief
that
he
was
aware
from
newspaper
articles
of
richardson's
having
testified
before
the
committee
and
having
identified
him
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
now,
mr.
tavenner
then
advised
him
that
the
committee
was
advised
that
a
witness
by
the
name
of
ross
richardson
has
stated
that,
“you
accidently
assigned
between
a
communist
party
group
on
the
campus
and
a
member
of
the
faculty
at
cornell
and
that
you
knew
the
name
of
the
member
of
that
faculty
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
will
you
tell
us
who
the
member
of
the
faculty
was?”
mr.
deutch
said,
“sir,
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
tell
you
about
my
own
activities,
but
do
you
feel
i
should
trade
my
moral
scruples
by
informing
on
someone
else?”
now,
then
the
chairman
explained
to
him
that
moral
scruples
was
not
a
legal
objection,
that
his
declination
must
consist
of
something
more
than
his
moral
scruples.
and
mr.
deutch
then
said,
“as
to
details
that,
i
think
the
whole
question
has
been
magnified
more
than
it
should
have.”
and
he
further
said
at
the
bottom
of
page
294,
“i
can
only
say
i
do
not
believe
i
can
answer
questions
about
other
people,
but
only
about
myself.”
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
sir.
he
--
he
refused.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
he
said
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
--
he
was
not
a
professor
at
all,
but
he
did
not
identify
the
person.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
your
honor,
other
than
the
testimony
and
the
opening
statement
during
the
course
of
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner's
appearance
in
washington,
these
other
materials,
the
albany
hearings,
the
opening
statement
of
the
chairman
at
those
hearings
or
report
of
the
committee
for
1954
and
so
forth,
those
things
were
put
in
on
the
question
of
actual
pertinency
of
these
questions
to
the
subject
matter
being
investigated
by
the
committee.
there
--
there
is
no
indication
that
the
petitioner
was
aware
of
these
other
--
of
this
other
information,
other
than
his
obvious
awareness
of
the
fact
that
the
committee
had
called
ross
richardson,
had
interrogated
ross
richardson
concern
--
concerning
communist
party
activities
at
cornell.
and
the
opening
statement
at
the
time
of
petitioner's
appearance
summarizing
in
a
nutshell
what
had
been
furnished
to
the
committee
concerning
petitioners
activities
at
cornell
and
the
committee's
desire
to
pursue
with
him
his
knowledge
of
communist
party
activities
in
cornell
and
in
the
ithaca
area.
now,
his
testimony
wasn't
limited
to
cornell
alone.
it
was
--
they
did
ask
him
questions
about
the
downtown
club
on
page
298.
“were
you
ever
a
member
of
the
downtown
club
at
the
communist
party
in
ithaca?”
he
said,
“i
don't
believe
so.”
“did
you
attend
meetings
of
that
group?”
and
he
said,
“no.”
so
that
--
he
was
asked
questions
about
cornell,
about
the
graduate
group,
about
the
professor,
about
the
donor
of
the
$100,
he
refused
to
answer
the
questions
about
the
professor
and
the
donor.
he
was
asked
if
he
knew
homer
owen,
who
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
did
say
on
page
295,
your
honor.
he
said,
“i
could
amplify
that
point,
i
do
not
mean
the
point
of
contempt.
i
think
--
i
--
i
happened
to
have
been
a
graduate
student.
the
only
one
there
and
the
organization
is
completely
defunct
and
the
individual
you
are
interested
in
wasn't
even
a
professor.”
the
magnitude
of
this
is
really
beyond
reason.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
committee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
--
the
question
appears
on
the
preceding
page,
“will
you
tell
us
who
that
member
of
the
faculty
was?”
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
richardson
had
told
the
committee
that
there
was
a
member
of
the
faculty.
the
petitioner
flatly
refused
on
the
grounds
of
moral
scruples
to
identify
the
member
of
the
faculty.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
at
first,
then
in
debating
to
some
extent.
he
said
that
the
organization
is
defunct.
in
other
words,
he's
--
he's
saying
that
based
on
information
that
i
know,
but
which
i
won't
tell
you
or
i
won't
let
you
verify,
i
am
making
a
determination
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
answer
is
unimportant
to
you.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
--
he
does
say
at
--
near
that
top
of
that
page
where
it
says
mr.
--
295.
he
said,
he
was
the
only
one
there
and
the
organization
is
defunct
and
the
individual
you
were
interested
in,
he
doesn't
deny
there
was
an
individual.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
individual
you
were
interested
in
wasn't
even
a
professor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
will
you
tell
us
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
“will
you
tell
us
who
that
member
of
the
faculty
was?”
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
refused
to
answer.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
said,
“the
individual
you
are
interested
in
wasn't
even
a
professor.”
he
does
not
say
he
was
not
a
member
of
the
faculty.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
assume
so,
your
honor.
the
record
doesn't
go
into
that.
i
--
i
think
it
clear
here
that
the
witness
was
not
answering
concerning
this
individual
whom
he
knew
the
committee
was
inquiring
about.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
i
certainly
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
an
individual
who
was
identified
by
ross
richardson
as
a
member
of
the
faculty.
a
person
whose
identity,
the
witness
obviously
recognized
--
obviously
recognized
that
he
could
give
an
answer
because
he
picks
him
out
and
then
he
says
he's
not
--
he's
not
a
professor.
so
that
there's
no
misunderstanding
on
the
--
on
the
witness'
part
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
as
to
who's
identity
is
called
for.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
the
question
was,
“who
was
that
member
of
the
faculty
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
for
whom
you
were
the
contact
with
the
communist
party?”
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
was
he
a
member
of
the
faculty
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
who
was
he?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
said
he
was
not
a
professor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
think
it
makes
quite
a
difference,
your
honor.
i
think
that
he
--
he
may
very
well
had
been
taking
the
position
that
he
was
an
associate
professor
or
--
or
a
--
an
instructor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
where
is
this,
your
honor?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
this
is
the
donation,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
isn't
it?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
is
the
$100
donation.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they
asked
him
--
oh,
yes.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
(inaudible)
that's
on
page
296.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
they
asked
him
--
mr.
tavenner
said
--
this
is
just
a
little
above
the
middle
of
the
page,
“the
committee
received
testimony
from
ross
richardson
to
the
effect
that
you
collected
certain
donations
for
the
benefit
of
the
communist
party
and
then
in
one
occasion
you
delivered
to
him
the
sum
of
$100,
without
designating
to
him
the
source
of
it.
will
you
tell
the
committee
please,
the
source
of
that
$100
contribution
if
it
was
made?”
mr.
deutch,
“no,
this
contribution
was
made.
i
believe,
i
gave
you
the
reason
why
i
declined
to
answer
regarding
names
and
this
was
from
a
personal
friend.”
and
then
in
further
discussions
he
says
that
he
doesn't
believe
the
donor
of
$100
wasn't
a
teaching
member
or
wasn't
a
member
of
cornell.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
was
indicted
--
the
indictment
appears
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
the
indictment
appears
at
page
7
or
beginning
on
page
6
of
the
record.
questions
are
set
forth
on
page
7.
first
question,
after
the
explanation
as
to
ross
richardson's
testimony
is,
“will
you
tell
us
who
that
member
of
the
faculty
was?”
the
second
question
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
--
the
preliminary
statement
on
that
count
explains
that
the
committee
was
advised
that
a
witness
by
the
name
of
ross
richardson
has
stated
that
“you
acted
as
liaison,
this
is
the
petitioner
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
to
a
communist
party
group
on
the
campus,
any
member
of
the
faculty
at
cornell
and
that
you
knew
the
name
of
the
member
of
that
faculty
who
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
will
you
tell
us
who
that
member
of
the
faculty
was?”
now,
count
two
is,
“will
you
tell
the
committee,
please,
the
source
of
that
$100
contribution,
if
it
was
made?
and
of
course
that
question
followed
the
recitation
by
the
committee
that
richardson
had
stated
that
petitioner
had
turned
over
to
him
$100
contribution
from
a
source
which
petitioner
did
not
disclose
to
richardson.
the
next
question
was
--
count
three,
“is
where
were
these
meetings
held?”
and
he
was
acquitted
on
that
count,
because
he
--
he
did
say
i
think
that
although
he
wouldn't
answer
--
that
he
didn't
where
they
were
held
and
the
district
court
acquitted
since
he
had
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
no
knowledge.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
and
in
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
that
was
a
basis
for
the
acquittal.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
district
judge,
that
he
was
tried
without
a
jury.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
now,
count
four,
“were
you
acquainted
with
homer
owen?”
count
five,
“the
witness
is
directed
to
give
a
name
of
the
person
by
whom
he
was
approached.”
and
the
evidence
shows
that
that
question
refers
to
the
person
who
approached
him
with
respect
to
joining
the
communist
party,
in
other
words,
the
person
who
recruited
him
into
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
or
--
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
certainly
now
in
his
record
you
cannot
say
they're
the
same
ones.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
the
petitioner
would
answer
the
questions
it
might
so
turnout,
but
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
so,
owen
is
identified,
that's
right.
but
--
but
his
reason
for
refusal
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
about
other
people.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
to
this
--
to
this
extent,
your
honor,
ross
richardson
can
testify
that
the
graduate
group
at
cornell
had
consisted
of
six
members,
the
petitioner,
homer
owen
and
mr.
marzac
and
their
wives.
you
--
you
will
notice
i
think,
we
--
we
covered
it
previously
that
during
the
course
of
the
petitioner's
testimony
before
the
committee,
he
says,
he
was
the
only
member
of
the
graduate
group
at
cornell.
so
that,
on
the
--
on
the
question
of
verifying
the
information
received
from
richardson
as
to
the
size
and
extent
of
the
graduate
group
alone.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
i
think
the
committee,
your
honor,
is
--
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
as
a
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
trying
to
get
the
facts
upon
which
they
can
make
(voice
overlap)
--.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
facts
conflict
with
what
the
petitioner
said,
your
honor.
and
i
think
is
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
committee
like
any
tribunal.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
because
the
committee
has
a
right
to
--
to
determine
the
extent
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no.
it
--
it
may
be,
your
honor
that
they
could
proceed
with
an
investigation
that
way,
but
on
the
other
hand,
a
committee
is
certainly
free
as
a
court
is
free
to
attempt
to
get
to
the
facts
and
to
ascertain
the
correct
facts.
and
if
it
does
have
conflicting
statements,
it
has
the
right
to
resolve
what
the
actual
facts
were.
and
i
certainly
don't
think
that
that
is
any
--
that
because
it
has
information
from
one
source
that
a
person
can
refuse
to
testify
before
the
committee
just
because
it
maybe
accumulative
evidence.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
aside
from
the
fact,
your
honor
that
the
committee
does
have
a
right
to
--
to
gather
cumulative
evidence,
that
this
question
as
to
homer
owen
was
obviously
a
preliminary
question
and
the
committee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
may
well
have
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
your
honor,
to
begin
with,
he
--
he
was
sentenced
to
90
days,
moreover
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh
no,
he's
been
sentenced
to
90
days.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
or
he
could
have
been,
yes.
but
the
point
is
your
honor,
that
he
can
--
has
no
more
right
unless
he
interposes
a
legal
objection
to
refuse
to
answer
a
proper
preliminary
question
which
may
lead
to
a
further,
more
direct
inquiry
than
he
has
to
refuse
to
answer
a
--
a
question
which
is
permanent
on
its
face.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think,
i
take
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case
it
does,
your
honor,
under
the
court's
decisions
in
barenblatt.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
court's
decision
in
barenblatt.
and
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
plus
the
fact,
your
honor
that
i
think
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
that
the
other
three
questions
that
he
was
convicted
for
refusal
to
answer
are
pertinent
of
there
face
and
that
really
the
court
does
not
have
to
concern
itself
very
much
with
the
question
relating
to
homer
owen.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
not
if
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
if
the
court
concludes
that
he
--
his
first
amendment
rights
in
refusal
to
answer
even
if
he
asserted
them
which
he
did
not.
in
refusal
to
answer
the
first
question,
do
not
overwrite
the
committee's
legitimate
interest
in
securing
the
information
and
therefore
he
was
not
authorized
or
not
permitted
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
refuse
to
answer
the
question.
if
he's
properly
convicted
for
the
first
count,
which
i
think
it's
very
clear
under
the
court's
decision
he
was
or
under
count
two
or
under
count
five,
then
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
was
a
general
sentence,
which
is
supported
by
a
--
a
proper
verdict
on
any
one
count,
then
the
verdict
must
be
sustained.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
committee
can
gather
cumulative
evidence
for
a
legislation
purpose.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
very
many
committees
have
done
it,
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
your
honor,
the
--
the
sentence
here
is
the
same
type
sentence
as
was
imposed
in
barenblatt.
it
--
it
is
a
general
sentence
upon
the
conviction
on
all
--
on
each
of
the
counts.
in
the
--
in
the
slip
opinion
of
the
court's
decision
in
barenblatt,
the
court
states
that
upon
conviction
under
all
counts,
a
general
sentence
of
six
months
imprisonment
and
a
fine
of
$250
was
imposed.
since
this
sentence
was
less
than
the
maximum
punishment
authorized
by
the
statute
for
conviction
under
any
one
count,
the
judgment
below
must
be
upheld,
if
the
conviction
upon
any
of
the
counts
is
sustainable,
citing
the
claassen,
roviaro,
whitfield
case
to
which
we
would
add
the
--
the
case
of
pinkerton
v.
u.s.,
328
u.s.
640,
which
i
think
you'll
support
for
the
type
of
sentence
that
was
given
here.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
court
sentenced
him
to
a
general
sentence
which
i
think
has
the
same
effect
and
the
court
has
so
held
as
if
he
had
sentenced
him
to
90
days
on
each
count
to
run
concurrently.
and
--
and
then
if
anyone
of
those
counts
supports
the
general
sentence,
then
the
--
the
verdict
below
must
be
sustained.
now,
to
just
spend
a
--
a
minute
or
two
on
the
--
on
the
question
that
be
diverted
from
the
beginning
as
to
the
--
the
question
here
or
the
distinction
that
we
make
and
we
think
the
court
has
made
between
actual
pertinency
or
jurisdictional
pertinency
as
the
court
i
think
referred
to
it
in
the
watkins
case
and
awareness
of
pertinency
which
is
a
completely
different
question.
as
we
see
it,
there's
a
two-fold
obligation
that
is
involved
in
one
of
these
cases.
one
is
that
the
statute
requires
that
there
be
proof
of
actual
pertinency,
pertinency
as
a
matter
of
law
to
a
subject
under
investigation
by
the
committee.
this
is
imposed
by
the
statute,
it's
an
element
of
--
of
the
offense,
it's
an
element
which
the
government
can
prove
or
must
prove.
and
the
failure
of
the
government
to
prove
actual
pertinency
of
course
can
be
raised
by
the
defendant.
the
second
problem
arises
as
a
result
of
the
requirement
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
watkins
case,
which
involves
the
question
of
the
awareness
of
pertinency
which
was
a
rule
evolved
for
the
protection
and
out
of
fairness
to
the
witness.
and
the
court
clearly
stated
in
the
watkins
case
that
if
the
witness
objects
on
the
grounds
of
pertinency,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
tribunal
then
and
i
think
it's
clear
only
then,
need
it
make
an
explanation
of
pertinency
to
the
witness.
if
it
is
already
been
made
clear
to
him,
it
would
not
even
have
to
make
in
the
--
further
explanation
in
those
circumstances.
but
a
--
an
obligation
on
the
committee
upon
the
refusal
to
answer
to
explain
the
pertinency
and
the
connective
reasoning
if
necessary,
only
arises
when
there
is
an
objection
at
the
time
the
question
is
propounded.
in
the
absence
of
such
an
objection,
what
the
government
must
do
at
trial
is
to
show
that
there
was
a
legislative
committee
that
it
--
that
it
would
performing
a
legislative
function,
that
it
did
have
a
subject
under
inquiry,
that
it
was
authorized
to
make
and
that
this
question
was
as
a
matter
of
law,
pertinent
to
such
subject
under
inquiry.
now
here,
the
district
judge
found
if
upon
this
evidence
that
the
committee
--
and
cannot
be
the
albany
hearings
of
which
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
say
that
the
--
the
petitioner's
testimony
was
a
part
even
though
it
may've
been
held
in
washington.
it
was
held
here
for
his
convenience.
the
only
purpose
of
the
hearing
being
held
here
was
because
he
--
he
begged-off
going
to
albany
on
april
9.
if
the
district
court
found
that
the
committee
in
the
conducting
the
albany
hearings
wasn't
interested
in
communism
in
labor
and
communism
in
the
field
of
education
and
the
possible
interrelationship
between
communism
and
labor
and
communism
in
the
--
in
the
educational
field.
the
--
a
petitioner's
appearance
before
the
committee,
he
was
told
very
clearly,
the
committee
wants
to
know
about
your
activities
at
cornell
in
the
communist
party
your
activities
in
ithaca.
he
was
told
specifically
about
what
richardson
had
testified
before
the
committee
concerning
the
petitioner's
activities.
and
it
had
told
him
these
precise
areas
that
richardson
was
unable
to
furnish
and
that
they
would
like
to
get
from
the
petitioner,
the
--
the
name
of
the
member
of
the
faculty,
of
the
donor
of
$100.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
they
--
if
they
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
because
all
we
would
have
to
show
at
the
trial
would
be
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
pertinency
as
a
matter
of
law
the
fact
that
he
didn't
raise
the
objection
of
pertinency
relieves
the
committee
of
the
--
of
the
obligation
of
explaining
it
to
him.
we
point
that
out
here
to
show
that
not
only
does
--
did
the
government
establish
its
case
in
that
way,
but
here
additionally,
there
i
think
is
abundant
evidence
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
aware
of
what
the
committee
was
calling
for.
he
was
aware
of
what
the
committee
was
interested
in
and
what
he
was
called
upon
to
give
the
committee.
so
that
under
--
under
any
theory
of
the
case,
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
witness
refused
with
full
knowledge
of
what
was
called
for.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
because
of
the
explanation
given
to
him
about
richardson's
testimony
and
the
committee
telling
him
we
want
to
--
we
want
to
interrogate
you
about
your
communist
activities
at
cornell,
there
explanation
as
to
richardson's
testimony
about
the
$100
donor.
i
think
that
that
put
him
on
notice
that
that
was
the
committee's
interest.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
sir.
now,
i
think
that
i
might
just
mention
very
quickly
the
argument
as
to
the
first
amendment.
first
of
all
or
preliminarily,
i
might
just
mention
that
this
court
in
the
yates
case,
the
yates
contempt
to
communist
case
held
that
the
refusal
to
answer
as
to
the
names
of
other
people
was
although
it
might
be
understandable
as
far
as
a
witness'
reluctance
to
furnish
names
in
certain
circumstances,
it
is
not
a
legal
objection
to
the
refusal.
i
--
i
think
this
record
makes
it
clear
the
petitioner
has
noted
--
had
no
--
at
no
time
asserted
a
legal
objection
to
responding
to
these
questions.
on
the
point
of
the
first
amendment,
our
position
is
he
didn't
raise
the
first
amendment.
no
time
that
he
refused
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
we
think
that
under
the
--
the
court's
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
ullman
case,
which
involved
the
immunity
statute
that
the
court
there
indicated
in
that
case
that
it
would
not
consider
a
first
amendment
objection
because
he
had
not
raised
it
before
the
trial
court
at
the
time
he
refused
to
answer
the
questions
of
the
grand
jury.
secondly,
even
aside
--
aside
from
that,
we
think
it's
very
clear
that
he
has
no
standing
to
rely
on
the
first
amendment
in
refusing
to
answer
as
to
some
other
person.
here,
he
--
he
identified
himself
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
--
and
he
says,
“but
i
don't
want
to
identify
the
member
of
the
faculty.”
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
no.
i
--
i
agree
with
that
your
honor.
but
--
i
mean
we
don't
--
you
don't
--
the
court
doesn't
even
have
to
get
to
the
point
where
it
has
to
balance
the
committee's
interest.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
and
that
even
if
the
court
should
apply
the
first
amendment
test
that
it
--
that
was
enunciated
in
--
in
sweezy
and
uphaus
and
barenblatt,
that
it
clearly
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
committee's
right
and
duty
to
--
to
exactly
answers
to
these
questions.
