i
thought
he
finally
said
that

not?

is
that

one
of

he
refused

answer

there's
no
misunderstanding
maybe,
but
he
answers
that
he

that's
what
they
asked
for.

that's
right.

on

he's
indicted

--
justice

black
yes,
sir.

and
did
he
say
this

was
he
asked
this
later,

i
ask

you

what
is

how
many
questions
was
he

what
did
each
one
involve?
justice

for
which
he
was
convicted.
justice
hugo

then
he
did
--
justice
hugo

black
he
answered
that
he
didn't
know,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo

black
and
he's
indicted
for
not
answering.
justice

and
the

acquitted

you
have
acquitted
him

how
many
persons

does
that
include

why
he
refused
to
give
the

a

a
person,
how
many
persons?
are
any
those

you
have
them
one.
justice

we
have
one
to
four
reasons

one
of
them
was,

you

what

that
with
that
lot
weighs
the
value
of
the
first
amendment
than
when
you
put
them
into
the
balance
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
did
you
have
to
verify
what
the
hired
agent
of
the
government
said
that
he
said
that
man
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they're
not
trying
out
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
verification
or
they
--
i
assume
that
it
wasn't
of
extreme
important
for
them
to
bolster
mr.
richardson's
evidence,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
have
the
facts
from
him,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
he
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
he
did
--
suppose
he
did,
how
would
that
have
to
pass
legislation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
right.
it
better
had
the
right
--
excuse
me.
it's
been
held
to
ask
questions
and
have
to
pass
legislation.
how
would
they
have
them
pass
legislation
to
know
whether
this
doctor
or
whatever
a
professor,
or
whatever
he
was,
had
said
one
thing,
if
there
was
a
conflict
which
i
have
seen
here
and
mr.
richardson
had
said
another,
who
is
richardson
being
the
government
informant.
surely,
they
don't
--
don't
need
to
bolster
the
informant's
evidence
to
pass
legislation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course,
it
might
be
possible
that
they
know
exactly
what
it
is
and
simply
wanted
to
get
him
to
refuse
to
answer
a
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
was
preliminary,
what's
the
importance
that
would
justify
sending
a
man
to
jail
for
hereon,
what
you
call,
dismissed
as
a
preliminary
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could've
been
sentenced
for
a
year
on
that
count,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
say
he
could
have
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
he
has
no
more
right,
but
the
committee
has
certain
rights
and
it
was
restricted
in
certain
ways,
does
it
have
a
right
to
ask
for
question,
which
is
of
no
importance
to
it
in
passing
legislation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
basis
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
hope
not,
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
has
to
concern
itself
does
it
not
with
their
importance,
in
connection
with
the
balancing?
the
committed
right
to
get
the
information
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
against
his
--
against
their
--
his
right
not
to
be
required
to
divulge
his
association.
