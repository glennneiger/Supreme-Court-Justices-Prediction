justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sawyer,
would
you
help
me.
i'm
little
bit
--
not
clear.
i
understood
you
to
say
or
i
may
have
misunderstood
you.
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
objections
here
were
the
specific
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
he
had
a
pertinency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
specific
--
a
pertinency
of
specific
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
objection
to
the
--
to
the
authority
of
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
generally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
not
understand
you
to
say
that
he
didn't
--
in
answer
to
justice
harlan,
that
he
didn't
know
what
the
general
scope
of
inquiry
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
didn't
he
--
didn't
he
say
--
did
he
raise
that
objection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
he
didn't
--
he
did
not
raise
objection
to
the
--
to
the
course
of
questions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
were
--
to
which
he
was
being
submitted,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
so
then
you
--
then
you
--
that's
why
i'm
confuse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
that's
why
i'm
confused
now
because
i
thought
you
did,
but
because
--
didn't
i
have
understood
you
to
say
he
objected
to
the
pertinency
of
certain
questions,
of
a
course
of
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
clear
even
now.
i
guess
they
don't
fit
my
questions.
if
he
didn't
object,
if
he
didn't
say,
i
don't
know
what
your
questions
--
what
you're
--
what
you're
asking
questions
about.
he
didn't
do
that,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
said
i
object
to
these
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
how
can
there
be
an
objection
to
relevance
of
these
questions
to
a
subject
matter
when
he
didn't
object
to
the
whole
subject
matter?
if
you
didn't
object
to
the
area
into
which
they
were
entering,
how
could
anybody
say
a
question
is
in
--
is
not
pertinent
to
that
area?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
trouble.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you're
not
objecting
to
a
valid
legislative
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
refer
me
to
the
record
where
when
mr.
deutch
was
called,
he
said,
from
my
point
of
view,
he's
allowed
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
of
your
questions
because
i
don't
know
what
they're
serious
about
"
or
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
you
don't
contend
that
when
he
began
to
be
asking
--
to
be
asked
questions,
and
when
he
began
to
answer,
he
did
not
object
that
there
was
no
subject
matter
to
which
he
was
addressing
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
was
there
any
contradiction
when
you
didn't
object
to
any
subject
matter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
i
don't
understand.
i'd
supposed
that
the
offenses
are
not
answering
questions
which
a
committee
of
congress
asked
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
we
--
what
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
offense
is
the
old
--
what
i
used
to
know
in
my
(inaudible)
102
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
it
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
well
i
quite
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
a
fellow
doesn't
object
to
it's
having
been
pertinent
to
the
subject
matter,
there
must
be
a
subject
where
people
ask
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
they're
in
sequence
or
whether
they're
for
hearing.
there
is
a
subject
matter
to
which
a
question
addresses
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
think
the
government
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
great
--
i
have
(inaudible)
by
analogies.
what
the
government
has
to
prove
is
that
there
was
a
subject
matter
under
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
did
prove
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
object
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
care
what
it
was.
if
you
didn't
object
to
it,
you
didn't
say
you're
asking
about
a
subject
matter
to
which
you
have
not
intended
to
ask
me
or
as
to
which
you
are
not
authorize
to
ask
questions,
how
can
you
say
what
the
--
the
questions
that
were
asked
if
you
were
not
relevant
to
a
subject
matter.
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
about
watkins.
all
i
know
is
you're
now
saying,
there
is
no
proof
the
question
will
ask
with
reference
to
a
subject
matter
and
you
tell
me
now
that
they
say
the
subject
matter
was
albany
and
it
should
have
been
ethical.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
proves
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
proves
that
there
was
a
subject
matter
of
inquiry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know
it
was
in
actual
subject
matter
when
you
didn't
object
to
it,
nobody
raised
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
point.
i
agree
with
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
draw
different
conclusions
from
that
sense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
start
with
for
your
--
your
last
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
you
can
conceive
that
this
is
possible
that
the
question
should
become
relevant
in
the
court
proceeding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
then
the
claims
to
make
a
jack
ass
of
himself
bind
from
being
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what's
the
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
getting
to
one
side
your
other
points.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
first
amendment
claim
and
to
the
extent
if
congress
can
ask
relevant
questions.
it
has
the
same
power
to
compel
this
testimony
from
witnesses
that
the
court
has.
once
you
--
i'm
--
i'm
putting
to
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
side
your
relevance
of
the
argument
which
i
appreciate
whatever
value
you
think
of
it.
so
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
-
but
if
it
comes
to
the
first
amendment,
what
difference
is
there
would
that
be
the
power
of
congress
to
compel
--
to
exercise
the
power
of
testimonial
compulsory
relevant
to
an
inquiry.
you
put
it
on
the
ground
that
the
kid
has
the
right
to
make
a
jack
ass
out
of
himself.
now,
why
can't
he
had
the
same
right,
the
same
claim
when
he's
called
in
court
assuming
it's
relevant
and
say,
"gee,
here,
my
success
in
cornell,
with
harvard
and
its
(inaudible)
will
be
timid,
therefore
i'll
keep
my
mouth
shut."
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
never
said
that
--
this
court
has
never
said,
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
this
court
has
never
said,
i
can't
imagine
if
it
would
say
that
provided
is
that
all
the
other
consideration,
the
duty
to
testify
is
less
before
a
committee
of
congress
and
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
know
the
conscience,
mr.
sawyer.
that
--
that
case
is
talking
about
congressional
investigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
concept
to
first
amendment
as
the
first
amendment
not
apply
to
the
court
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
same
consideration
maybe
raised
by
witness.
he
may
say.
this
is
so
remote,
the
good
it
will
do
in
this
litigation
but
i
don't
want
to
make
a
jack
ass
of
myself
and
i'm
great
believer
and
the
young
making
jack
ass
of
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
got
a
ruling
here
from
the
tribunal
which
is
power,
forgetting
your
other
point,
which
is
power
to
elicit
information
to
compulsory
process
otherwise
congressional
investigation
that
would
be
worth
it,
everybody
could
come
as
noted
congress.
the
power
of
testimonial
compulsion
relevant
to
an
inquiry
if
it
is
justifiable
under
the
potentialities
of
legislation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
overruled
it.
what
i
am
saying,
why
couldn't
you
get
as
the
same
ruling
if
a
court
makes
such
a
ruling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
say
that
really
i
don't
--
i
don't
want
to
preach
on
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
sympathizes
that,
then
our
question,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
right
to
--
to
try
to
reach
a
very
strongly
conviction
i
have
on
that
subject.
but
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
confronted
with
the
power
of
congress
which
may
be
abused,
this
court
abuse
their
power
which
is
--
what
is
called
an
abuse
that
court
abused
their
power
to
severe
sentencing,
well
i
think
they
ought
to
give
them,
etcetera,
etcetera.
we're
concerned
with
the
power
of
congress
to
elicit
answers
to
compulsory
because
that's
the
only
way
to
do
properly
at
all.
there's
lots
of
stuff
going
on
in
congress
and
i
think
truly
are
and
you
may
think
truly
are.
but
i
cannot
see
the
difference
so
far
as
the
first
amendment
is
concern
if
we
have
to
put
to
one
side
the
relevance
of
the
inquiry
between
the
congress
and
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you
are
--
what
you
are
arguing
for
is
really
the
right
of
the
witness
--
the
right
of
the
witness
to
determine,
when
he's
getting
enough
evidence
that
ought
to
satisfy
the
jury
by
the
--
the
committee.
what
this
witness
said
is
i'll
tell
you
what
i've
given
you
or
to
satisfy,
and
your
further
inquiries
are
really
so
putative
or
so
inclusive
compared
with
the
value
that
can
make
it
out
of
it.
i
determine
this
not
you
who
have
the
power
to
compel
me
to
testify.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
makes
the
denial.
the
committee
must
stress
with
that
denial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
often
make
choices
into
which
way
to
elicit
questions
and
to
some
of
witness
at
the
bar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
may
not
know
all
he
thinks
he
knows.
that
happens
to
me
constantly
that
i
thought
i
knew
more
until
people
expose
my
ignorance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
he
hasn't
because
he
has
withheld
information
about
people
who
may
shed
additional
light
on
the
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
refer
to
page
293
when
mr.
tavenner
told
mr.
deutch
what
the
hearing
in
albany
was
about
and
then
mr.
deutch
conferred
with
mr.
sawyer,
his
lawyer?
and
then
decide
to
answer
some
questions
on
the
(inaudible)
decide
to
answer
other
questions
not
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
told
him
exactly
what
took
place
at
albany.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
hearing
the
before
the
committee
why
mr.
deutch
was
on
the
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
do
you
refer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
271?
justice
felix
frankfurter
men
are
on
faculties
for
decades
without
becoming
professor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
your
understanding,
mr.
maroney,
that
in
--
investigation
was
by
a
congressional
committee
either
in
the
house
or
the
senate,
the
committee
is
restricted
--
cannot
ask
questions
of
which
it
already
knows
the
answers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
cannot
call
a
witness
as
cumulative
testimony
to
what
has
already
been
testified
to
and
it
can't
do
this
again
and
again
and
again,
is
that
your
understanding
that
that's
the
past
history
of
congressional
investigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can
ask
questions
which
it
has
already
--
which
it
knows
or
which
it
have
documentary
evidence
and
can
pile
it
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
been
done
time
out
of
mind
in
the
whole
history
of
congressional
investigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
is
your
basis
for
saying
he
was
aware
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
record
goes
beyond
that.
he
says
“i
see.”
when
the
chairman
explained
to
him
what
it
was
all
about,
it
is
heard,
“yes,
i
see.”
and
he
said,
“you
invoke
601.
601
tells
you
what
it's
all
about
to
invoke
that
in
the
terms
and
mr.
doyle
explained
it
to
him,
“therefore
you
see,
i'm
calling
your
attention
to
the
fact,
this
question
goes
into
be
extent.”
i
just
wanted
--
called
up
your
attention
mr.
deutch,
“yes,
i
see.
the
only
thing
i'm
saying,
sir,
my
challenge
is
--
is
a
constitutional
--
on
the
public
law
601.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
fact
that
--
in
fact,
he
seeks
to
protect
somebody
else
wouldn't
be
invoking
the
first
amendment
for
somebody
else,
if
in
fact
the
question
wasn't
relevant
either
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
under
power
of
the
committee
or
otherwise,
was
not
a
question
that
they
could
validly
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
because
he's
trying
to
protect
somebody
else,
it's
because
that
is
valid
only
--
i
mean
that's
an
invalid
objection
only
if
otherwise
he's
on
the
duty
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
sawyer,
area
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
an
intrinsic
absolute
this
term,
if
the
functional
term
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
depends
in
area
in
relation
to
what?
