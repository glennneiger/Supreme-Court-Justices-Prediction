excerpts
of
a
subcommittee
hearing
in
albany.
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
--
was
that
a
part
of
the
record
of
the
hearing
at
which
the
petitioner
was
a
part?
this
is
called
--
this
is
held
in
albany.
justice
william
o.
douglas
were
--
were
they
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
were
not
in
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
now,
when
you
say
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
when
you
say
hearing,
you
mean
hearing
before
the
committee.
justice
william
o.
douglas
not
--
not
the
--
not
the
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
course
is
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
it
was
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
this
--
this
was
--
was
this
at
the
hearing
or
this
at
the
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
--
do
i
have
to
--
do
i
have
to
follow
who
was
mr.
tavenner
to
pick
out
what
was
said
at
the
hearing
or
is
there
some
group
of
pages
here
in
the
record
that
give
me
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
291?
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you
very
much.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
is
the
both
side
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
both
--
both
sides
agreed
that
the
issues
of
pertinency
--
pertinency
must
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
these
exhibits?
justice
william
o.
douglas
they
were
introduced
at
the
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
--
those
were
not
introduced
or
referred
to
in
these
hearings,
were
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
counsel,
maybe
you
don't
have
very
much
time
but
maybe
if
i
ask
you
a
question
you
can
perhaps
tomorrow,
those
are
laid
upon
one
of
my
difficulties.
suppose
--
suppose
that
i
am
summoned
by
committee
and
ask
one
question,
what
is
your
name
and
i
refuse
to
answer
and
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
then
the
trial
comes
on
in
the
court.
and
the
only
record
before
the
committee
is
just
those
that
bears
question
and
answer
and
refusal.
and
then
the
committee
at
the
trial
seeks
to
establish
the
ingredient
of
--
of
the
crime
of
pertinency
by
putting
in
hearings
on
--
and
other
times
involving
other
people
on
other
issues,
can
they
use
that
against
me?
that's
my
--
that's
one
of
my
difficulties
with
this
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
isn't
so
far
as
this
petitioner
goes?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
you
--
as
you
were
ending
your
--
your
argument
yesterday,
you
were
referring
to
page
293,
where
mr.
tavenner
for
the
committee,
refers
to
hearings
at
--
at
albany.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
think
it
is
significant
or
it
maybe
significant
that
--
the
--
the
subject
matter
of
those
hearings
was
--
is
not
to
be
found
in
--
in
the
transcript
of
this
hearing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
don't
even
know
from
this
hearing
whether
it
was
about
this
-
this
matter
or
some
other
matter
or
some
related
matter.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
then
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
may
i
just
continue,
just
a
minute
--yes,
sir.
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
to
indicate
that
the
--
the
reach
of
my
question,
because
if
you
turn
to
page
33,
you
--
you
come
to
judge
holtzoff's
opinion
in
which
he
says
a
little
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
what
those
albany
hearings
were
about.
and
it
was
about
trade
unionism
and
communist-controlled
trade
unions.
justice
william
o.
douglas
none
of
which
--
none
of
which
appears
from
the
reference
to
the
albany
hearings
on
page
293.
now,
maybe
that's
irrelevant,
but
at
least
those
are
the
problems
that
were
in
my
mind
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
that
you
were
closing
yesterday.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i've
--
i've
read
those
and
that's
--
there's
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
