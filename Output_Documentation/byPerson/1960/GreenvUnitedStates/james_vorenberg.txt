mr.
james
vorenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
these
consolidated
cases
grow
out
of
the
robbery
of
the
norwood
bank
and
banking
company
in
norwood,
massachusetts
in
september
of
1951.
the
petitioner
here
and
two
codefendants
were
indicted
on
indictments
in
three
counts.
count
1
charged
entry
of
the
bank
with
the
intention
to
commit
a
felony
in
violation
of
section
2113
(a)
of
the
criminal
--
federal
criminal
code.
count
2
charged
robbery
at
the
bank
in
violation
of
the
same
subsection.
and
count
3
charged
aggravated
robbery,
that
is
that
they
put
the
--
they
put
named
persons
in
jeopardy
in
the
process
of
committing
the
robbery
named
in
count
2.
one
of
the
codefendants
pleaded
guilty
and
testified
on
behalf
of
the
government.
the
petitioner
here
and
another
codefendant
pleaded
not
guilty
and
were
tried.
they
were
convicted
on
all
three
counts
and
were
sentenced
to
three
concurrent
sentences,
20
years
on
count
1,
20
years
on
count
2
and
25
years
on
count
3,
sentences
that
i
have
mentioned
to
run
concurrent.
there
are,
in
fact,
two
separate
cases
here.
there
are
two
records
in
this
court
but
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
the
government
and
the
petitioner
have
filed
but
--
one
brief
each
covering
the
two
cases
on
a
consolidated
basis.
both
of
these
cases
arise
under
separate
motions
under
rule
35
to
attack
the
sentences
as
being
illegal.
there
is
no
issue
here
of
a
new
trial,
simply
a
question
of
an
attack
upon
the
sentence.
since
the
issue
and
the
issues
in
the
two
cases
are
almost
unrelated,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
turn
first
to
no.
70.
the
issue
on
that
case
is
simply
whether
rule
32
(a),
subparagraph
(a)
of
rule
32
of
the
federal
criminal
rules,
requires
that
the
trial
judge
before
sentencing
ask
the
accused
if
he
has
something
to
say
to
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
can
be
quite
simply
stated.
the
petitioner
did
not
testify
on
his
behalf
at
the
trial.
subsequent
to
the
conviction,
the
court
held
a
hearing
approximately
one
week
later
at
--
which
it
announced
that
it
would
impose
sentences.
also
at
that
hearing,
it
considered
two
other
motions,
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
and
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
would
convince
anyone
that
it
is
--
it
was
a
somewhat
confused
hearing
with
these
three
matters
being
interwoven
throughout.
the
--
about
midway
in
this
hearing,
petitioner's
counsel
made
a
short
statement
on
petitioner's
behalf.
in
the
--
the
thrust
of
his
statement
was
that
petitioner
had
a
number
of
other
criminal
matters
pending
and
that
he
had,
as
his
counsel
said,
a
long
road
to
travel
and
on
that
basis,
counsel
asked
that
the
court
be
lenient.
at
the
conclusion
of
this
hearing,
the
judge
made
a
sharply
critical
statement
of
the
petitioner
and
of
his
codefendant.
he
referred
to
them
as
madmen,
stated
that
they
deserved
no
consideration
and
on
two
separate
occasions,
stated
that
there
was
not
one
word
that
can
be
said
on
their
behalf.
without
interruption,
he
went
on
to
impose
sentence.
subsequent
to
the
imposition
of
sentence,
a
few
days
later,
he
signed
the
judgment
and
commitment
form,
setting
forth
in
effect
what
we
had
done.
this
form
stated
specifically
that
the
court
had
asked
the
petitioner,
had
asked
the
accused
if
he
had
something
to
say
before
sentence
was
pronounced.
in
fact,
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
no
such
question
was
ever
asked
and
the
government
conceded
as
much
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so
i
think
we
can
proceed
on
the
factual
assumption
that
the
--
that
no
question
was
ever
put
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
by
the
judge.
in
1959,
the
petitioner,
who
was
at
that
time
and
is
still
confined
at
alcatraz
serving
these
sentences,
made
a
motion
under
rule
35
to
have
the
sentence
vacated
on
this
ground.
there
were
two
other
grounds
that
are
not
relevant
here
because
the
court
limited
the
grant
of
certiorari
to
this
whole
question
of
this
--
of
the
interpretation
of
rule
32
(a).
mr.
james
vorenberg
yes,
he
was,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
he
was
the
trial
judge
and
if
you'll
look
in
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
excuse
me.
mr.
james
vorenberg
not
that
i
--
i
know
of
no
history
that
is
relevant
and
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
--
which
i
believe
this
form
was
--
was
signed
in
the
ordinary
course
shortly
--
shortly
after
the
trial.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
that
i
can't
explain,
your
honor.
the
--
and
--
in
talking
to
the
--
in
raising
that
same
question
with
the
clerk's
office
in
boston,
i
had
--
have
no
insight
into
it.
mr.
james
vorenberg
this
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
1959.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
nothing
between
the
--
between
the
signing
of
this
order
in
the
ordinary
course
and
the
preceding
sentence,
at
least
nothing
of
which
i
know,
your
honor,
or
been
unable
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
he
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
he
--
the
sentence
was
--
was
not
appealed.
he
took
an
appeal
but
did
not
prosecuted
and
it
was
dismissed
for
want
of
diligent
prosecution.
mr.
james
vorenberg
judge
aldrich
was
the
judge
who
ruled
on
the
motion
in
this
branch
of
the
case,
to
vacate
the
sentence
under
rule
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
don't
know
if
he
was
sitting
as
emergency
judge
or
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
the
--
the
usual
practice
is
that
any
matter
that
is
related
to
a
case
will
stay
with
the
judge
who
heard
that
case.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
maybe
that
--
that
judge
aldrich
was
at
that
time
sitting
as
the
emergency
judge.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know.
the
--
judge
aldrich's
denial
of
this
motion
in
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeal
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
--
can
be
quite
simply
stated.
the
petitioner
asserts
that
rule
32
(a),
subsection
(a)
of
rule
32,
gives
the
accused
a
right
to
speak
to
the
court
in
person
prior
to
the
time
sentence
is
pronounced,
and
that
this
is
a
right
that
the
trial
judge
has
a
duty
to
offer
to
the
accused.
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
they
assert
that
the
right
need
not
be
a
personal
right
of
the
accused
but
maybe
a
right
of
his
counsel.
and
that
no
affirmative
action
of
the
trial
judge
is
necessary
to
see
that
the
accused
does
have
the
opportunity
to
speak.
i
think
it
is
worth
saying
again
that
the
only
--
that
all
that
is
at
stake
in
this
case
is
a
remand
for
resentencing.
that
there
is
no
assertion
on
the
petitioner's
part
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
new
trial
because
of
this
error.
turning
first
to
the
language
of
subsection
(a)
of
rule
32,
which
appears
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
we
believe
that
it
is,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
rule
35
means
what
it
says
on
its
face
that
a
--
an
illegal
sentence
maybe
corrected
at
any
time.
we
believe
that
this
sentence
is
illegal
because
the
procedure
by
which
it
was
pronounced
is
illegal.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
don't
think
it
relates
to
the
trial,
your
honor.
i
think
it
relates
--
the
trial
was
over.
it
relates
to
the
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
yes.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
i
think,
it
--
it
maybe
more
convenient
to
come
back
to
that
after
i
have
spelled
out
a
little
bit
the
--
the
history
of
the
--
of
this
right.
but
in
some,
it
is
our
review
that
it
is
the
--
it
is
an
illegal
sentence.
subsection
(a)
of
rule
32,
and
it's
--
the
only
--
the
last
sentence
that
is
relevant
here,
appears
on
page
9
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
it
reads
as
follows,
"before
imposing
sentence,
the
court
shall
afford
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf
and
to
present
any
information
in
mitigation
of
judgment."
i
think
it
is
worth
emphasizing
that
there
are
two
sub-phrases
there,
an
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf
and
to
present
any
information
in
mitigation
of
judgment.
if,
as
the
government
suggests
in
its
brief,
the
sole
purpose
of
this
right
is
to
permit
someone
on
the
accused
team,
so
to
speak,
to
bring
information
that
maybe
relevant
in
mitigation
of
sentence,
it
would
have
been
unnecessary
to
make
any
reference
to
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf.
it
would
have
been
sufficient
to
say
that
he
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
present
information
in
mitigation
of
punishment.
if
that
language
means
anything,
we
think
it
simply
means
that
there
is
to
be
a
personal
statement
by
the
accused
that
if
he
wishes
to
make
such
a
statement.
it
is
true,
as
the
government
suggest,
that
the
word
"defendant"
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
federal
rules
to
mean
the
defendant
either
acting
alone
or
by
his
counsel.
but
the
context
in
which
it
is
used
in
the
sections
to
which
they
refer
is
completely
different.
i
don't
think
i
can
improve
on
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
an
opinion
en
banc
that
was
handed
down
last
month
on
this
issue.
considering
this
contention
of
the
government,
the
court
says
as
follows,
"we
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
it
is
not,
your
honor.
this
opinion
is
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief.
it
has
--
it
came
down
since
we
filed
our
brief.
it
was
decided
on
december
12th,
1960
and
its
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
taylor
versus
united
states.
mr.
james
vorenberg
taylor.
referring
to
this
contention
of
the
government,
the
court
said,
"we
cannot
agree."
the
words
"shall
afford
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
in
his
own
behalf"
seems
to
connote
a
different
and
more
extensive
procedure
that
exist
when
a
defendant
moves,
requests
or
act
under
other
sections
of
the
rules.
i
would
suppose
that
if
one
was
looking
for
an
analogy
to
the
use
of
the
word
"the
defendant"
in
rule
32
(a),
the
closes
place
to
look
would
be
rule
43,
which
says
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
present
throughout
the
trial.
historically,
these
two
rights
have
been
related
to
one
another.
and
in
each
case,
i
think,
it
--
is
a
--
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
the
right
is
a
personal
right.
it's
clear
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
right
of
rule
43
is
not
a
right
to
have
one's
counsel
present
because
that's
protected
elsewhere,
but
it's
the
right
to
be
physically
present
in
court.
in
short,
we
say
that
without
going
beyond
the
language
of
the
rule
and
its
obvious
intent,
it's
a
personal
right.
the
history
of
the
rule
bears
this
out.
the
rule
is
the
natural
--
natural
evolvement
of
the
historic
right
of
allocution,
which
developed
at
or
it
can
be
found
in
the
early
common
law,
at
least
as
early
as
the
17th
century.
this
was
a
right
given
to
the
accused
to
address
the
court
before
sentence
was
pronounced.
now,
this
--
it
is
true
that
this
was
a
right
that
grew
up
at
a
time
when
the
accused
had
no
counsel,
did
not
have
a
right
to
have
counsel.
but
it
is
also
true
that
it
has
survived
long
beyond
the
time
when
the
accused
did
have
a
right
to
counsel
and
therefore,
the
--
our
position
is
that
the
substance
of
the
--
of
the
right
is
as
significant
today
as
it
--
as
it
was
in
--
in
earlier
times.
the
--
on
the
specific
issue
presented
to
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
no,
i
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
he
should
be
allowed
to
have
a
say.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
that
is
right,
your
honor.
but
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
one
of
the
original
purposes
of
the
right
of
allocution
was
the
opportunity
to
make
a
statement
in
mitigation.
and
i
think
there
are
very
good
reasons
why
that
is
a
--
a
right
that
the
accused
should
be
permitted
to
make
personally,
perhaps,
in
addition
to
his
statement
by
counsel
but
there
are
very
good
reasons
why
that
should
be
a
personal
right.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
that
--
that
really
is
the
issue
here
and
that
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
in
this
case
and
indeed
in
any
case.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
not
quite,
your
honor,
because
it
is
my
position
that
the
right
is
not
the
right
to
make
a
statement
but
the
right
is
the
right
to
have
the
question
asked.
this
is
how
the
right
grew
up,
as
the
right
to
have
a
question
asked
of
the
individual
of
the
--
the
accused.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
don't
know.
i'll
go
one
step
further,
your
honor.
it's
a
right
to
have
the
specific
question
put
to
the
individual,
put
to
the
accused.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
is
exactly
the
petitioner's
position.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
holding
out,
your
honor,
for
any
magic
words.
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
code.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
the
duty
of
the
--
of
the
trial
judge
to
be
sure
that
this
question
has
been
put
and
the
only
way
he
can
be
sure
is
if
the
question
is
put
by
him
to
the
accused.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
--
i
kind
of
conceive
of
--
of
situation,
factual
situation,
where
the
trial
judge
might
look
over
the
bench
at
the
defendant
and
ask
that
question
and
the
defendant
would
shake
his
head
and
nudge
his
counsel.
mr.
james
vorenberg
and
this
counsel
would
get
up
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
if
--
if
that
question
if
--
is
put
directly
to
the
defendant
as
it
was
not
--
never
done
in
the
--
in
the
case
before
us
here,
if
the
record
satisfies
the
court
that
the
question
has
been
put
to
the
defendant,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
can
do
anymore.
the
court
can't
make
the
defendant
say,
"no,
i
don't
want
to
speak."
but
i
think
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
to
--
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
--
i
--
i
think
it
becomes
--
it
may
well
become
a
factual
question
in
any
given
situation
as
to
whether
the
question
has
been
put
to
the
accused
individually.
take
--
i
mean
this
case
is
a
perfect
example
in
the
middle
of
an
argument
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
the
judge
turned
to
the
defendant's
lawyer
and
said,
"did
you
want
to
say
something?"
or
--
clearly
that
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
defendant
could
think
he
had
an
opportunity
to
get
up
and
rise.
and
nowhere
else
in
the
preceding
was
there
the
slightest
indication
that
the
trial
judge
was
ready
to
hear
from
the
defendant.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
can't
speak
--
i
can't
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
--
speak
for
judge
ford
on
that.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
judge
--
judge
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
it's
the
only
--
that
is
the
only
way
to
prove
that
he
was
asked
the
question.
i
don't
think
judge
aldrich
thought
that
he
had
ever
been
asked
the
question
and
that
it
was
a
problem
of
proof.
judge
--
judge
aldrich
said
was
that
the
presence
of
counsel
and
the
fact
that
counsel
made
a
statement
and
the
accused
sat
there
and
said
nothing
is
an
indication
that
the
accused
had
nothing
he
wanted
to
say.
and
i
think
this
case
turns
on
our
contention
that
that
is
not
a
permissible
inference.
and
while
we're
talking
about
this
issue,
i
just
suggest
that
this
--
the
trial
record
in
this
case
is
about
as
good
a
case
in
point
as
you
could
imagine.
you
have
this
highly
confused
hearing
as
i
mentioned.
you
have
this
vitriolic
statement
by
the
judge
in
which
he
said
twice
that
i
--
there
is
not
one
word
that
can
be
said
on
behalf
of
this
defendant.
that
clearly
was
not
the
time
when
one
could
reasonably
expect
the
--
the
defendant
to
rise
on
his
own
behalf
and
start
saying
these
prohibited
words.
mr.
james
vorenberg
and
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
that
if
--
if
--
i
would
not
be
willing
to
attribute
to
judge
ford
that
much
of
a
close
mind,
your
honor.
that
if
he
was
willing
--
i
think
if
he
was
willing
to
listen
to
these
defendants,
he
would
have
been
willing
to
listen
to
them
with
an
open
mind.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
that
that
must
be
--
that
is
an
inference
that
this
court
certainly
should
draw
that
the
fact
that
he
was
not
willing
to
--
to
listen
to
them
was
a
denial
to
them
of
the
substantive
right
of
having
a
trial
judge.
he
was
sufficiently
interested
in
whatever
they
might
want
to
say
in
their
own
personal
behalf,
so
that
he
was
not
in
a
position
where
he
was
--
he
should
impose
sentence
at
that.
mr.
james
vorenberg
it
might
well
--
it
might
well
have
thought
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
he's
convicted
in
1952
--
in
--
in
1951.
mr.
james
vorenberg
1959.
mr.
james
vorenberg
on
this
point
we're
discussing
now
the
historic
substance
of
the
right
of
allocution
was
a
right
that
it
had
to
appear
in
the
record
that
it
was
not
enough
to
make
the
type
of
inference
that
we
have
been
discussing
here.
the
--
the
notes
of
the
advisory
committee
on
the
federal
rules
are
inconclusive
on
this
point.
the
--
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
--
those
notes
in
the
general
history
of
the
adoption
of
rule
32
(a)
plead
to
the
conclusion
that
was
--
was
intended
was
to
carry
into
federal
procedure,
the
right
to
have
the
personal
question
put
to
the
accused,
the
traditional
form
of
the
right
of
allocution.
perhaps,
the
clearest
indication
of
this
is
that
at
the
same
time,
the
federal
rules
were
adopted
that
was
promulgated
this
form
25,
which
is
the
suggested
form
to
be
used
with
those
rules.
and
that
form
continued
in
effect
the
--
the
language
--
the
court
having
asked
the
defendant
that
if
he
had
anything
to
say
in
its
own
behalf.
i
just
suggest
that
it
would
be
highly
incongruous
for
the
court
to
adopt
the
--
a
rule
that
has
one
meaning
and
adopt
with
it
a
--
a
suggested
form
for
use
by
the
trial
courts,
which
has
a
completely
different
meaning.
mr.
james
vorenberg
there
is
not
--
there
is
no
such
form,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
isn't
it
unlikely
that
the
standard
form
that
was
adopted,
your
honor,
would
be
for
the
rather
rare
case
when
the
defendant
does
not
have
counsel?
this
--
this
is
a
form
that
is
used
in
--
in
cases
in
which
the
defendant
has
counsel.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
the
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
would
suppose
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
--
i
stand
corrected
then,
your
honor.
i
withdraw
the
rare
case.
but
certainly,
the
--
there's
a
great
mass
of
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
represented
by
counsel
and
then
there's
no
indication
that
the
framers
of
the
rules
and
of
this
form
were
simply
thinking
of
--
of
this
as
the
right
in
those
cases
where
there
was
no
counsel.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
the
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
the
word
"defendant"
means
the
defendant
--
i
think
it's
--
it's
hard
to
say
the
defendant
having
been
asked.
i
mean,
to
me,
the
--
the
word
"ask"
has
the
--
has
the
flavor
of
a
personal
question.
and
i
--
it
is
also
persuasive,
i
think,
that
this
is
almost
word
for
word,
the
traditional
form
of
the
right
of
allocution
as
it
is
historically
developed
in
the
law.
that
it's
a
--
it
--
it
reads
almost
the
same
way,
the
early
english
cases,
setting
aside
sentences
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
don't
think
that
at
the
time
this
rule
developed
that
there
was
a
right.
i
think
this
was
the
defendant's
sole
opportunity
to
be
heard,
the
right
of
allocution,
i
think
was
the
sole
opportunity.
mr.
james
vorenberg
no,
but
could
this
--
could
--
this
could
come
up
either
under
a
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
--
well,
again,
the
right
arose
at
the
time
when
most
offenses
were
capital
offenses.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
can't
--
because
i
can't
pinpoint
that
date.
i
think
that
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
the
--
there
are
very
few.
that
--
there
are
only
four
federal
cases
that
it
considered
this.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
--
all
the
early
cases
relating
to
the
development
of
this
right
were
capital
cases.
mr.
james
vorenberg
the
lower
federal
courts,
considering
the
particular
issue
involved
in
this
part
of
the
case,
are
split.
i've
not
tried
to
add
up
the
number
of
judges
on
opposite
sides
of
this.
i
think
it
is
worth
saying
that
even
those
courts,
which
have
taken
the
view
that
the
right
is
not
a
right
to
have
a
personal
question
put
to
the
accused,
have
indicated
that
it,
in
their
view,
it
is
better
practice
to
do
so.
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
district
of
columbia,
which
has
considered
this
question
most
carefully,
in
an
en
banc
decision
in
couch
v.
united
states
decided
--
cited
on
page
14
of
our
brief,
has
held
that
in
a
decision
given
prospective
application
only
but
has
held
that
from
and
after
the
date
of
that
decision
in
all
criminal
cases
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
trial
judge
must
ask
the
question
of
the
defendant
personally.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
--
i
would
assume
that
it
constituted
the
construction
of
the
rule.
i
mean,
they
were
--
it
was
purported
to
be
a
construction
of
the
rule.
i
assume
that
they
are
--
their
consideration
of
that
question,
in
its
relationship
to
the
rule,
is
exactly
the
same
as
this
court's
consideration
of
the
question
now
in
relationship
to
the
rule.
mr.
james
vorenberg
oh,
i
think
--
i
think,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
he
is
deprived
of
a
very
important
substantive
right.
we
don't
suggest
that
this
--
that
we're
just
trying
to
continue
in
the
modern
practice
an
obsolete
form
from
the
15th,
16th
or
17th
century.
in
the
first
place,
the
lawyer
cannot
possibly
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
the
defendant's
personal
background
that
might
be
relevant
with
respect
to
his
sentence.
just
--
it
get
--
it
--
no
longer
is
related
to
the
facts
of
the
individual
case.
it
becomes
an
issue
rather
of
what
kind
of
a
human
being
this
is.
and
i
just
suggest
that
while
the
lawyer
may
have
some
insight
to
shed
on
that,
in
relationship
to
the
object
of
record
that
the
individual
himself
also
has
an
important
insight
to
shed
on.
he
may
by
--
by
making
a
statement
to
the
court
just
by
the
sincerity
of
his
manner
by
what
he
has
to
say,
by
saying
something
that
the
--
his
lawyer
just
didn't
know
about
and
couldn't
have
known
about,
convinced
the
judge
that
he
has
--
he
has
realized
the
seriousness
of
what
he
has
done,
convinced
the
judge
that
he
has
a
better
rehabilitation
risk
than
the
judge
might
otherwise
think.
i
mean
it's
a
--
we're
living
in
a
time,
i
guess,
when
objective
testing
techniques,
objective
methods
of
testing
personality
have
become
very
common.
but
i
don't
think
that
anybody,
with
any
knowledge
in
this
field,
thinks
that
you
cannot
thereby
abandon
completely
the
importance
of
a
personal
contact.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
that's
always
possibly,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
[laughs]
mr.
james
vorenberg
the
--
i
think
it's
unquestionably
true
that
the
most
important
insights,
the
court
is
going
to
get
into
the
personality
of
the
defendant,
will
come
from
the
probation
report
and
the
object
of
record.
it
is
also
true
that
the
accused
can
tell
the
--
his
counsel
a
lot
of
the
things
in
his
background.
but
you
then
come
down
to
the
hard-core
of
the
man-to-man
relationship
between
one
human
being
who
was
passing
judgment
on
another
and
it's
not
such
a
burdensome
requirement
that
it
--
it
seems
to
make
much
sense
to
say,
"well,
that's
not
important
that
counsel
can
do
it
for
him."
that
doesn't
hold
up
the
process
of
just
as
much
for
the
judge
to
put
the
question
right
to
the
defendant
rather
than
assuming
that
he
has
nothing
he
could
say.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
--
i'd
just
be
guessing
if
i
spoke
on
that
except
for
one
--
one
point,
your
honor.
i
refer
in
my
brief
two
hearings
before
the
house
of
representatives
committee
on
the
judiciary.
and
in
those
hearings,
judge
biggs
quite
casually
said
that
it
is
customary
to
ask
the
defendant
if
he
has
anything
to
say
on
his
own
behalf.
that's
the
only
piece
of
objective
information
i
have.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
excuse
me.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
if
the
--
if
in
this
case,
the
judge
said,
as
you
say,
does
the
defendant
have
anything
he
wishes
to
say
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
--
and
clearly
directs
that
question
to
the
defendant.
i
don't
know
what
more
he
can
do.
that
seems
to
me
to
--
to
comply
with
the
substance
of
the
right.
and
i
--
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
indicate
the
contrary.
i
think
that
would
satisfy.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
asks
the
question
and
looks
over
at
counsel,
then
i
would
think
that
the
right
had
not
been
complied
with.
that's
why
i
think
it
--
it
--
that
the
only
way
to
end
the
confusion
here
is
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
to
the
lower
court
judges
that
this
is
a
right
that
is
to
be
accorded
personally
to
the
defendant.
it's
not
--
it
is
not,
as
i've
mentioned
before,
particularly
burdensome
one.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
--
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
but
i
think
--
that
may
well
be
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
but
i
think
that
maybe
one
of
the
prices
that
has
to
be
paid
for
the
according
of
this
right.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
--
well,
i
--
that's
not
--
that's
not
my
case,
your
honor,
but
i
would
--
i
would
think
that
in
that
case
that
it
might
well
be
that
the
judge
would
want
to
satisfy
himself
after
counsel
has
spoken
that
he
has
heard
from
the
defendant
personally.
this
again
not
relating
at
all
to
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
because
that's
behind
the
court
at
this
point,
but
in
an
effort
to
see
whether
the
defendant,
himself,
can
shed
any
light
on
--
on
the
issue
of
--
of
sentence,
the
--
if
for
no
other
reason
and
i
don't
suggest
this
is
the
only
reason,
i
think
that
this
is
an
important
right
so
that
the
defendant,
when
he
goes
off
to
prison
or
other
punishment
is
imposed
on
him,
will
have
the
feeling
that
there
is
not
bottled
up
in
him,
something
that
he
could've
said
that
would've
affect
the
judgment
of
the
court.
in
other
words,
it
becomes,
to
some
extent,
not
only
that
justice
should
in
fact
be
done
but
that
justice
should
have
appear
to
be
done.
and
to
me,
the
--
the
balance
is
so
heavily
in
favor
of
according
this
right.
i
mean
its
--
it
requires
such
a
small
ritual
of
the
--
of
the
trial
judge.
and
it
is
--
there
is
so
much
at
stake
on
the
other
side
that
i
can't
see
any
strong
argument
against
it.
mr.
james
vorenberg
cannot
stop
him.
mr.
james
vorenberg
at
that,
i
think
is
--
i
--
i
don't
have
much
trouble
with
it,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
--
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i've
--
i
--
i
don't
think
i'm
saying
anything
different,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
i
don't
think
there's
a
magic
formula
of
words
but
i
would
think
that
the
rule
this
court
should
annunciate
is
that
the
trial
judge
must
personally
ask
the
defendant
if
he
has
anything
to
say.
no
more
than
that.
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
error,
if
he
asks
the
question
this
way
rather
in
that
way.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
would
think
that
would
not
be
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
that
would
be
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
would
not.
mr.
james
vorenberg
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
this
is
what
--
this
is
what
rule
32
(a)
means
and
i
think
it's
a
good
rule.
really,
that's
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
what?
mr.
james
vorenberg
that
--
that's
the
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
--
petitioner's
position,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
the
meaning
of
that
is
perfectly
clear,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
but
as
i
tried
to
indicate
earlier,
there
are
--
the
context
of
this,
the
reference
to
making
a
statement,
the
history
of
it,
which
i
spelled
out
very
briefly,
indicates
that
this
is
a
--
is
to
be
a
personal
right
that
you
--
as
--
as
i
mentioned,
the
rule
defendant
has
used
in
rule
43
talking
about
the
right
to
be
present.
i
will
--
it's
clear
beyond
any
doubt
that
that
means
in
person.
mr.
james
vorenberg
because
of
the
history
and
--
and
the
meaning
it
wouldn't
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
--
make
any
sense
otherwise,
so
i
think,
the
same
thing
can
--
can
be
said
here.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
looking
at
this
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
do
not,
your
honor,
think
it
is
--
it
is
relevant
in
considering
the
substance
of
a
clear
federal
right
that
by
granting
it,
a
number
of
people
may
seek
to
exercise
it.
i
think
the
question
is
to
whether
it
is
--
it
is
a
right
that
can
be
raised
under
35
(a)
is
something
that
deserves
a
little
consideration.
now,
as
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i've
--
i
question
whether
that
is
really
so,
that
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
language
that
is
--
that
is
clear,
with
history
that
is
clear
and
with
a
--
a
good
rule
behind
it,
that
it
maybe
one
of
the
prices
that
has
to
be
paid
by
the
federal
system
that
a
number
of
defendants
may
seek
to
exercise
that
right.
and
then
i
think
it
is
worth
mentioning
that
we're
talking
not
about
a
new
trial
in
these
cases,
we're
talking
about
coming
back
for
resentencing
and
i
don't
know.
i
think
it
just
a
guess.
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
i
think
it
is
just
a
guess,
your
honor,
as
to
how
many
defendants
will
seek
to
exercise
that
right.
i
wouldn't
try
to
guess
it.
on
the
--
on
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
raised
at
the
outset
as
to
the
--
the
meaning
of
rule
35,
i
mean
as
to
the
right
to
raise
this
--
the
meaning
of
rule
32
(a)
under
rule
35,
this
comes
into
this
case
as
something
went
after
thought
on
the
government's
part.
in
the
district
court,
the
government,
as
far
as
i
know,
did
not
file
any
memorandum
of
law
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
filed
a
brief
that
made
no
mention
whatsoever
of
the
position
which
it
takes
here
that
rule
35
is
not
a
--
an
appropriate
remedy.
for
the
first,
it
doesn't
mention
it
in
its
questions
presented.
for
the
first
time
in
its
brief
in
this
court,
it
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
this
is
an
illegal
sentence,
which
may
be
attacked
under
rule
35.
i
would
just
suggest
that
this
court's
treatment
of
the
similar
handling
of
this
problem
by
the
government
in
the
ladner
case
is
appropriate
here.
the
issue
has
been
raised
too
late
and
the
court
should
pass
onto
the
merits.
mr.
james
vorenberg
they
--
they
do,
your
honor,
but
i
--
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
this
is
an
instance
where
appropriate
consideration
has
not
been
given
to
the
--
to
the
issue.
i
just
mentioned
this.
i
don't
rely
on
it
frankly
because
i
think
it
is
so
clear
that
rule
35
is
available
for
just
this
type
of
question.
it
is
not
a
form
of
--
rule
35
is
not
a
form
of
collateral
attack
as
the
government
suggest.
it's
a
proceeding
in
the
same
case
and
that's
not
a
technical
difference,
it's
a
difference
of
real
substance
here
because
all
that's
involved
is
the
correction
by
the
original
trial
judge
of
his
sentence.
all
that's
necessary
is
for
the
defendant
to
come
back
and
be
resentenced.
it
does
not
require
a
new
factual
trial.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
latter
is
a
much
harder
question,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
think
this
is
a
much
easier
question,
a
very
easy
question
that
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
[laughs]
the
--
traditionally,
going
back
to
the
earliest
cases
dealing
with
the
right
of
allocution,
these
were
attacked
by
a
--
what
amounted
to
a
form
of
collateral
attack,
a
writ
of
error.
it
has
always
been
clear
even
before
the
issues
of
the
expansion
of
the
habeas
corpus
writ.
in
more
recent
years,
it
has
always
been
true
that
an
illegal
sentence
could
be
attacked
in
a
collateral
proceeding.
so
even
if
this
is
viewed
as
a
form
of
collateral
attack,
it
is
quite
clear,
i
believe,
that
the
--
the
issue
can
be
raised
in
this
court.
in
the
--
in
the
government's
brief,
it
refers
to
united
states
v.
mayer,
decision
of
--
this
on
page
42
of
the
government's
brief,
decision
of
this
court
in
235
u.s.,
where
the
court
says
that
"the
remedy
applied
only
to
that
very
small
number
of
legal
questions
which
concern
the
regularity
of
the
proceedings
themselves."
well,
now,
this
is
exactly
what
is
involved
here,
the
regularity
of
the
proceedings
by
which
sentence
was
imposed.
the
government's
suggestion
that
the
--
that
the
sentence
is
not
illegal
that
is
rather
just
some
defect
in
the
procedure
by
which
it's
imposed,
seems
to
me
to
be
without
merit.
i
don't
believe
rule
35
is
limited
to
cases
where
the
length
of
the
sentence
is
involved.
i
think
that
sentence
can
be
illegal
either
on
its
face
or
by
the
procedure
by
which
it
is
passed
or
in
the
method
if
--
well,
i
--
just
those
two,
the
--
the
procedure
and
the
--
and
the
face
of
the
sentence.
i
would
like
to
pass
now
to
the
second
part
of
this
consolidated
case.
no.
179
has
in
it
two
more
or
less
separate
issues.
one
is
the
question
of
the
multiple
sentences
which
were
imposed
by
the
trial
judge.
the
facts
appeared
just
from
the
sentences
themselves.
he
imposed
on
a
three-count
indictment,
one
sentence
for
20
years
on
the
entry,
another
sentence
for
20
years
for
bank
robbery
and
a
third
sentence
of
25
years
for
aggravated
bank
robbery.
i
would
suppose
that
it
had
been
clear
since
the
government's
concession
of
the
fact
in
holiday
and
johnston
in
this
court
and
it
certainly
has
been
accepted
in
all
the
lower
federal
courts
that
the
aggravated
form
of
robbery
is
not
a
separate
crime.
that
section
2113
(d)
providing
for
25
years
sentence
if
robbery
is
committed
under
aggravated
circumstances
is
merely
a
--
an
extra
five
years
that
can
be
added
to
the
sentence
if
certain
facts
are
shown.
that
the
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
impose
separate
sentences
for
robbery
and
for
aggravated
robbery.
and
the
petitioner's
contention
in
this
branch
of
this
case
is
that
when
the
court
imposed
the
first
sentences
of
20
years
for
robbery,
he
had
exhausted
the
power
to
sentence.
there
was
no
--
he
no
longer
had
any
further
power
to
impose
an
additional
sentence.
mr.
james
vorenberg
the
first
one
was
not
void,
your
honor,
at
least
not
under
this
ground.
it
may
have
been
void
for
failure
to
accord
the
right
of
allocution
but
it
was
not
void.put
--
putting
that
to
one
side,
the
20-year
sentence
was
a
valid
sentence.
and
the
25
--
when
he
--
when
he
completed
the
20
--
20-year
sentence,
he
had
performed
an
effective
act
of
sentencing
the
defendant.
and
the
defendant's
position
is
simply
that
the
25-year
sentence
is
a
nullity.
the
lower
courts
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
no,
your
honor.
if
--
if
the
--
if
we
are
right
on
the
first
branch
of
this
case,
the
sentence
is
--
if
invalid
and
this
--
the
case
would
be
remanded
to
the
district
court.
mr.
james
vorenberg
if
we're
wrong
on
that,
you
have
a
valid
20-year
sentence
and
a
--
mr.
james
vorenberg
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
vorenberg
in
any
case,
we
suggest
that
if
the
court
does
not
accept
the
suggestion
on
--
that
the
sentencing
power
was
exhausted
that
this
is
another
reason
to
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
to
see
if
the
district
court
would
have
imposed
the
same
sentence
had
it
known
that
there
was
but
one
punishable
offense
here,
that
this
court
should
not
speculate
on
--
on
that
question.
this
is
similar
to
the
court's
decision
in
--
in
yates
versus
united
states,
355
u.s.,
where
it
set
--
it
set
aside
10
of
11
concurrent
sentences
for
contempt
and
then
sent
the
11th
one
back
to
the
district
court
to
see
whether
he
would
have
imposed
as
stiffer
sentence
that
he
had
known
there
was
only
one
sentenceable
offense
involved.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
just
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
simply
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
think
it
is
clear
though
in
the
--
in
the
federal
--
in
federal
law
now
that
there's
no
difference
of
opinion
as
far
as
i
know.
and
i
--
i
would
think
the
government
would
--
would
agree
on
that.
on
the
third
part
of
this
case,
the
petitioners
claimed
that
because
of
the
judge's
misdefinition
of
the
crime
of
aggravated
robbery
in
his
charge
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
never
could
have
convicted
for
that
offense.
it
is
--
the
facts,
again,
are
--
are
fairly
clear.
on
page
31
and
32
of
our
brief,
we
cite
the
repeated
misdefinitions
by
the
court
of
the
crime
of
aggravated
robbery.
the
--
the
crime
requires
a
showing
that
persons
have
been
put
in
jeopardy.
yet
repeatedly,
the
court
referred
to
fear
as
being
enough
or
the
use
of
a
dangerous
weapon
as
being
enough.
now,
with
only
one
of
those
two
factors
involved
and
no
showing
of
jeopardy,
the
only
crime
is
the
crime
of
simple
robbery.
for
that,
the
maximum
sentence
is
20
years
and
our
contention
is
that
the
court
below
imposed
a
--
an
excessive
sentence
by
imposing
a
25-year
sentence.
the
government's
reply
to
that
is
that
the
only
defects
which
may
be
attacked
in
their
motion
under
rule
35
are
those
appearing
in
the
common
law
record,
the
--
the
old
judgment
rule,
the
indictment,
the
plea,
the
verdict
and
the
sentence.
well,
that's
a
rule
or
a
limitation
that
grew
up
at
a
time
when
that
was
all
that
was
available
on
appeal.
but
in
this
case,
we
have
the
record.
there's
no
--
there's
no
problem
now
of
--
of
knowing
what
the
court
below
did.
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
a
--
a
situation
where
you
have
to
look
at
the
instructions
to
see
what
the
jury
convicted
among
of,
to
see
what
the
juries
were
guilty
on
count
3
man.
and
that
if
you
do
that,
you
--
you
see
that
it
was
--
it
meant
nothing
more
than
a
conviction
of
simple
robbery.
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
--
in
the
heflin
case,
i
think,
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
--
when
he
thought
of
going
out
--
we
leave
open
the
question
under
rule
35
as
to
whether
you
can
go
outside
of
the
record,
clearly
not
talking
about
the
common
law
record
because
he
was
talking
of
those
things
which
required
a
hearing.
in
the
ladner
case,
which
i
referred
to
earlier,
the
court,
i
think,
made
it
clear
that
it
was
willing
to
even
have
a
hearing
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
sentence.
the
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
if
this
court
remands
this
case
by
any
of
the
grounds
we
have
raised,
that
it
seems
appropriate
that
it
made
it
clear
to
the
trial
judge
that
full
credit
should
be
given
for
time
already
served
and
that
for
purposes
of
good
time
credits
and
parole,
the
sentence
should
be
deemed
to
run
from
the
date
originally
imposed,
otherwise,
it
would
be
completely
unfair
penalty
on
him
for
having
raised
the
issue
here.
thank
you.
mr.
james
vorenberg
i
would
be
very
glad
to
your
honor
but
i
don't
(inaudible)
mr.
james
vorenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
small
factual
issue
which
i
think
should
be
laid
completely
to
rest.
in
counsel
for
the
government's
statement
of
the
case,
he
left
it
somewhat
uncertain
as
to
whether
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
had
in
fact
been
asked
whether
he
had
anything
to
say
on
his
behalf.
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
assumed
that
the
question
had
been
directed
to
counsel
rather
than
the
petitioner.
i
would
like
to
read
from
the
government's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
--
this
is
page
nine.
it's
clear
from
an
examination
of
the
record
on
this
case
that
there
is
no
indication
of
the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing
as
to
this
appellant
if
he
desired
to
make
a
statement
in
person.
i
just
--
i
--
i
don't
think
that
is
an
issue
where
we
--
this
case
has
been
argued
on
the
assumption
that
the
question
was
not
directed
to
the
petitioner
but
i
thought
that
should
be
like
clearly
to
rest.
the
only
other
point
that
i
would
like
to
raise
in
the
very
brief
time
i
have
left,
relates
to
this
problem
of
perspective
application
that
has
been
introduced
in
the
argument
here.
in
the
brief
of
the
government
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
its
brief
here
and
it
has
proceeded
solely
on
the
basis
on
the
allocution
point
that
the
--
on
the
merits,
our
interpretation
of
the
right
given
by
rule
32
(a)
is
wrong
that
it's
not
a
personal
right.
it
need
not
be
a
personal
right.
of
course,
i
now
understand
the
government's
position,
it
is
perversed.
it
is
prepared
to
conceive
that
henceforth,
it
would
be
willing
to
see
the
rule
interpreted
as
giving
a
personal
right.
and
that
it's
--
the
only
issue
is
--
whether
this
should
be
applied
retroactively
or
prospectively.
i
believe
it
is
fair
in
considering
this
question
to
put
to
one
side
the
rule
35
question.at
least,
i
feel
i've
said
about
all
i
can
say
on
that
in
my
argument
yesterday
and
in
the
brief
that
the
--
this
type
of
attack
on
a
sentence
is
the
classic
attack
on
the
sentence.
and
i
don't
think
i
can
add
to
that.
and
i
think
in
mr.
kramer's
statement
just
now,
he
conceded
that
the
--
that
the
suggestion
of
rule
35
isn't
applicable,
relate
solely
to
the
administrative
problem,
the
burden
on
the
court
on
--
on
the
federal
courts.
i
just
suggest
that
this
argument
on
the
practical
burden
on
the
courts
deserves
the
suppose
attention
of
this
court.
it
seems
to
me
it's
highly
speculative.
in
the
first
place,
it's
a
matter
of
guest
as
to
how
many
judges
have
failed
to
ask
this
question.
in
15
years
under
the
rule,
there
have
only
been
a
dozen
cases
that
i
know
of.
judge
biggs
in
the
testimony
i
referred
to
yesterday
said
that
it
is
customary
for
the
question
to
be
asked.
if
there
are
a
large
number
of
cases
that
is
still
questionable,
how
many
of
them
will
come
back
before
the
court.
but
assuming
that
a
substantial
number
of
prisoners
will
exercise
this
right,
the
burden
on
the
--
on
the
judicial
system,
it
seems
to
me
is
of
a
very
minor
nature.
you're
talking
about
a
brief
appearance
before
the
sentencing
judge
in
which
the
petitioner
--
the
accused
would
be
asked
question
granted.
there
maybe
some
transportation
expense
getting
him
to
and
from
the
court.
but
to
me,
the
real
scope
of
the
burden
goes
no
further
than
that.
and
finally,
it's
a
temporary
burden.
it's
--
it's
something
that
would
be
over
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time.
i
don't
think
if
--
if
we
consider
only
the
practical
side
of
it,
i
don't
think
it's
one
sided
by
any
means.
because
i
think
there's
a
--
a
very
strong
practical
argument
against
perspective
application.
i
think
that
it
--
if
you're
considering
the
administration
of
justice
to
have
a
large
number
of
prisoners
serving
the
rest
of
their
terms
and
the
knowledge
that
they
are
denied
this
right
which
the
supreme
court
now
says
it's
a
right
that
they
always
had
under
rule
32
(a)
but
they
just
didn't
get
in
the
right
time
period
in
effect
that
they
lost
their
rights
under
a
fluke.
i
just
suggest
that
is
another
fair
consideration
for
this
court
if
it's
balancing
practicalities.
my
final
point
is
that
i
think
that
the
suggestion
that
this
court
prospectively
applied
an
interpretation
of
a
rule
in
the
criminal
case
is
without
precedent
and
it's
unsound
as
a
matter
of
judicial
administration.
thank
you,
your
honor.
