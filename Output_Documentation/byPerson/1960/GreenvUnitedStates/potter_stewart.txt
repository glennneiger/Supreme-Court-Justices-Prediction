justice

mr.
vorenberg,
i
suppose
there's
no
way
that
you
could
know
how
--
how
usual
it
is
or
how
unusual
it
is
for
--
for
a
district
judge
to
give
the
defendant
personally
an
opportunity
to
exercise
this
right,
as
you
say
--
say
should
be
given.
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker
said
--
indicated
his
practice
on
this
district
judge,
you
had
no
way
a
copy
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
wondering
as
a
practical
manner
--
matter,
how
many
thousands
of
applications
are
there
under
rule
35,
if
that
--
if
that
rule
is
not
clear?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
there's
a
lot
of
other
references
to
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
rules
where
it
doesn't
mean
that.
i
mean
just
lawyers,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
history,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kramer.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
taking
you
back
several
steps,
some
--
in
answer
to
a
question
of
chief
justice,
you
said
that
the
district
judges
were
divided
in
their
opinion
as
to
the
wisdom
of
this
rule,
quite
apart
from
any
retrospective
proposition,
just
as
to
the
wisdom
of
--
of
the
couch
rule,
can
you
tell
me,
to
satisfy
my
curiosity,
what
--
what
objection
do
you
have
to
those
who
do
object?
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
don't
indicate
that
they
are
opposed
to
it
in
principle
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
certainly
they
don't
indicate
why
they
are
opposed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
it,
if
they
are.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
is
an
alien,
i
think,
doesn't
he?
wasn't
--
wasn't
--
i
just
reading
that
he
is
an
alien?
