justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
break
in,
mr.
vorenberg.
it
doesn't
appear
who
the
sitting
judge
was.
the
order
on
page
25
by
judge
ford
does
not
relate,
he
wasn't
the
--
the
trial
judge,
was
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
intervened
between
the
judgment
of
sentence
on
october
27,
1952?
was
there
any
--
a
history
between
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
did
this
filing
clerk's
office
55,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
this
proceeding
--
the
proceeding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
brings
you
here,
when
does
that
start?
justice
felix
frankfurter
1959
and
nothing
in
between
relevant
to
our
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
and
--
and
nothing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
no
--
no
steps
were
taken
--
his
sentence
wasn't
appealed,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
sentence
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
begin
then
with
whenever
--
whatever
month
--
was
is
it?
june.
how
did
judge
aldrich
come
in
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
he
was
sitting
in
the
appropriate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
that's
--
my
question
really
is,
why
wasn't
it
referred
to
judge
ford?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
usual
practice
up
there?
the
same
--
one
judge
who
have
charged
of
everything
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
altogether,
this
is
the
record
that's
full
of
mystery,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
key
--
and
the
keyword
of
your
statement
is
"substance
of
the
right".
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
that
it
--
if
there's
anything
to
be
said
for
him,
it
should
be
said.
i
don't
mean
to
beg
the
question
by
saying
"for
him".
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
that
substance
mean,
they
should
be
allowed
to
have
a
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
the
question
is
how
--
what
he
wants
to
say
is
to
be
elicited
from
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
necessary
to
--
as
--
as
to
some
other
rights
not
waivable,
except
to
those
that
are
not
waivable
and
wants
to
be
sure
that
he
hasn't
been
denied
that
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
question
is
whether
particular
circumstances
properly
interpreted
to
constitute
a
withholding
of
that
right
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
position
is
that
he
must
be
asked
that
the
judge
must
say,
"your
lawyer
may
not
have
told
you
or
--
or
your
lawyer
may
not
have
advised
you
or
your
lawyer
maybe
incompetent
or
your
lawyer
may
have
this
or
that
and
other
consideration.
i'll
tell
you,
john
smith,
you
personally
are
entitled
to
make
a
speech
now."
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must
know
that
he
has
that
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
--
then
i
do
understand
that
there's
no
way
of
meeting
that
right
except
by
having
the
judge
say,
"john
smith,
have
you
got
anything
to
say
before
i
impose
sentence?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
that
question
cannot
be
inferred
from
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
any
magic
word.
he
must
address
him
by
explicit
language
that
he
can
understand
that
he
is
being
addressed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
he
says,
"john
smith,
i
will
now
hear
from
the
defendant,"
that's
all
right.
but
if
he
says,
"i
will
now
hear
from
the
defendant,"
that's
all
wrong
because
--
or
inadequate,
so
your
position
is,
though
you
haven't
--
you've
gone
almost
to
be
(inaudible)
but
not
quite,
your
position
is
that
form
is
substance
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
probably
the
greatest
surprise
if
you
were
told,
probably
was
that
--
that
defendant
didn't
clearly
understand
that
he
had
anything
to
say
in
addition
to
the
eloquence
of
his
counsel
that
he
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
can't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
gets
to
the
point
whether
when
--
whether
one
can't
infer
as
you
would
infer
in
ordinary
normal
human
situation
that
--
that
the
opportunity
to
talk
was
amply
conveyed
there
in
the
setting
of
what
took
place.
this
fellow
has,
as
one
understands,
a
very
competent
lawyer
if
i
may
use
that.
i
might
--
i
think
there
would
a
difference
if
you
--
if
he
had
no
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
say
it's
a
question
of
fact,
if
you
say
it's
a
question
of
fact,
then
we're
in
a
very
different
ground
from
saying,
"no,
this
is
a
rigid
rule,"
and
one
can
say,
"well,
the
district
judge,
judge
aldrich
thought
the
circumstances
satisfy
the
requirement."
the
court
of
appeals
thought
so
who
are
we
to
rule
it."
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
say
to
fix
--
if
it
--
if
you
say
that
the
formula
must
be
gone
through
because
that's
the
only
way
to
prove
that
he
was
asked.
that's
clearly
what
it
get
sounded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
also
assume
that
whatever
had
been
said
would
have
left
not
a
dent
on
the
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
--
all
i
meant
was
that
judge
ford
might
justifiably
think
that
mr.
callahan
could
speak
for
him
as
well
as
he
could
for
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
the
rare
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
are
those
the
rare
case?
why
is
it
rare?
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
the
place
of
guilty,
which
constitute,
i
suppose,
the
largest
percentage
of
sentencing.
this
rule
also
applies
to
those
cases,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
cases
or
the
old
cases
make
a
distinction
between
capital
cases
and
non-capital?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we'll
get
down
to
1830.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can't
either.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
i
mean
to
say
is
when
the
capital
cases
were
largely
contracted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
that,
the
english.
i
want
to
know
what
happened
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
capital
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
do
you
--
i
take
it,
you
might
say
that
it
is
not
unknown,
we
have
some
historic
cases
that
an
(inaudible)
person
might
be
more
eloquent
to
know
how
to
graduate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
thinking
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
what
he
says,
i'd
be
glad
to
hear
from
him.
you
personalize
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
--
why
do
you
have
a
reserve
against
saying
that
the
only
safe
rule
for
this
court
to
acknowledge
is
that
the
formula
must
be
put
to
the
defendant
explicitly,
and
those
were
the
phrase
of
ours,
because
that's
the
only
way
to
avoid
controversy
as
to
whether
it
was
the
record
to
him
personally
or
whether
it
was
--
the
--
the
lawyer
was
conduit
to
him
or
the
--
all
the
ambiguities
of
human
situations
and
phrasing
are
avoided
if
one
has
a
fixed
rule,
if
it
is
as
important
as
you
argue
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
that
the
words
but
--
do
i
gather
from
your
answer
that
it
would
be
error
--
it
would
be
inadequate
or
not
a
fulfillment
of
the
requirement
if
the
trial
judge
says,
"i'll
now
hear
from
the
defense"?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
says,
"i'll
now
hear
from
the
defendant,"
without
saying
john
smith
or
mr.
john
smith
or
mr.
john
smith
(inaudible)
got
anything
to
say,
he
wouldn't
--
he
wouldn't
boggle
over
the
explicit
way
in
which
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
do
say
that
this
is
an
implicit,
rigid
iron
rule,
namely
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
he
must
address
or
must
look
at
prisoner
and
he
must
look
at
the
defendant
in
the
eye,
he
ought
to
look
at
his
face
and
say,
have
you
had
anything
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
our
job
is
to
find
out
meaning
and
not
just
the
word,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
take
care
of
the
feeling
one
has
that
here
was
a
--
a
defect,
if
it
wasn't
in
effect
in
late
1951
and
somehow
rather
this
great
wrong
wasn't
discovered
by
the
person
not
fully
innocent
in
the
weight
of
the
world
till
1959.
and
that
there
must
be
probably
their
bounds
would
be,
i
should
think
--
i
should
think
it
says,
there
you
say
estimate,
guess
that
there
must
be
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
cases
in
which
district
courts
didn't
have
this
conception
because
the
lawyer
took
care
of
it
or
they
said
what
about
--
has
the
defense
anything
more
to
say
etcetera.
and
that
if
you
prevail,
you'll
be
--
you
--
you'd
be
a
great
benefactor
to
people
in
alcatraz,
joliet
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
those
relevant
considerations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
because
it's
a
clear
right
and
there's
no
problem
but
in
determining
what
35
means,
we
have
to
take
into
consideration
consequence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
he
just
settled
for
a
trip
from
alcatraz.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
--
how
can
it
be
--
how
can
it
be
tentatively
or
contingently
or
qualifiedly
a
valid
sentence
in
order
to
strike
down
from
other
sentence
wherein
the
ground
on
which
you
set
aside
--
you
actually
have
set
aside
the
judgment
in
70,
is
that
there
is
an
--
an
irreclaimable
effect
in
the
sentence,
that
it's
a
void,
that
is
--
it
--
it
was
imposed
in
defiance
of
a
requisite
factor
which
makes
it
a
valid
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
either
valid
or
invalid,
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
muhammad's
coffin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
so
you're
arguing
the
alternative
on
validity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kramer,
the
--
the
presupposition
of
your
argument
is
that
in
each
case,
the
appellate
court,
the
court
of
appeals
normally,
eventually
this
court,
will
be
called
upon
to
define
whether
the
substantive
purposes
of
312
(a)
are
satisfied
by
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
that's
the
presupposition
of
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
that
in
neither
the
petitioner's
brief
nor
your
brief,
in
a
reference
to
a
case
that
seems
to
me
irrelevant
in
consider
of
your
researches,
i
must
conclude
that
it
isn't
relevant.
and
that's
bruno
against
the
united
states,
involving
another
protected
doctrine
of
criminal
law,
namely
the
right
to
have
a
jury
charged
with
the
failure
to
take
the
witness
stand
is
not
to
be
counted
against
the
defendant.
and
the
argument
there
was
made
and
that's
a
--
the
jury
don't
take
any
stock
in
it
and
was
taking
care
of,
generally,
the
courtroom
that
it
must
be
specifically
such
a
--
such
a
charge
and
certainly,
if
requested,
must
be
specifically
given.
and
it's
not
in
the
realm
of
argument
that
it
didn't
hurt
(inaudible)
be
given.
how
would
i
say,
declared
to
me
that
this
is
not
unlike
the
problem
of
this
case,
namely
the
extent
to
which
you
--
you
withdraw
from
argument
in
a
particular
case
a
protected
rule
to
exert
in
its
argument
and
had
a
great
deal
to
be
set
forth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
am
(inaudible)
therefore,
i
must
take
them
from
you
and
from
mr.
vorenberg
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
thought
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
there
wasn't
really
a
conflict
in
the
starting
point
at
the
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
district
court,
namely,
i
understood
you
may
have
misunderstood
me
to
say,
namely
that
--
that
in
fact
while
they
believed
the
rule
is
to
be
respected
and
is
important
and
--
and
(inaudible)
as
we
called
it,
they
have
tried
this
particular
case
to
see
if
this
would
not
called
the
spirit
of
it
was
--
was
enforced,
what
is
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
courts
of
appeals
that
have
said
flatly,
this
is
an
imperative
command?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
cases
are
there?
how
many
court
of
appeals
that
that
has
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
--
i
must
say
that
the
new
york
rule
takes
away
the
consideration
that
has
been
knocking
around
in
my
head
as
to
the
importance
of
observing
the
rule,
namely
that
the
impact
of
the
judge,
he
could
say
a
man
puts
on
a
silk
gown
and
he's
same
old
man,
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
not
taking
for
myself
that
the
--
that
the
figure
of
justice
represented
by
a
judge
maybe
vocative
policies
that
i
should
deprecate
being
substituted
by
having
the
clerk
aspect
question
with
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
first
is,
there
is
no
problem
if
there's
any
indication
that
--
that
the
defendant
wanted
--
wanted
to
speak.
is
there
any
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
he
wanted
to
speak
and
wasn't
asked
or
wasn't
allowed
any
of
that
the
grossest
kind
of
cutting
off
of
--
they
don't
even
need
a
rule
for
that,
i
should
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
how
many
is
some?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
what
kind
of
a
method
is
thrown
out
to
catch
these
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
--
and
i
think
that
--
my
guess
would
be,
knowing
the
two
men
pretty
well
my
guess
would
be
that
the
uniform
they
ask
in
cases
where
there
is
no
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
where
this
is
a
counsel,
they
think
his
--
they
--
they
would
assume
and
with
good
justice,
i
should
think,
in
most
instances
anyhow
that
his
protection,
the
protection
to
be
solicited
or
as
the
lawyer
who
stands
in
front
of
him
will
take
care
of
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
may
be
coming
forth
in
--
in
some
aspect
of
immigration
laws,
mr.
kramer,
where
more
than
one
offense
is
required
affordability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
that's
why
it
makes
it
important
to
wipe
to
stay
clean
so
that
they
shouldn't
be
on
the
record.
well,
then
i
should
like
to
make
it
clear
that
the
government
would
have
no
objection
at
this
time
if
the
two
20-year
sentences
were
void.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
are
you
going
to
use
a
lot
of
fraction
of
15
minutes,
mr.
kramer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
not
intended
to
--
to
inhibit
or
order
that
you
could
get.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
the
judgment
of
conviction,
just
what
you
mean,
mr.
kramer,
do
you
mean
the
sentence
in
fold
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
attack,
because
they
say
that
the
judgment
of
sentence
as
advised,
why
do
that
attack
the
used
verdict?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
consequence
of
that
which
follow
the
judge's
charge
is
the
imposition
of
