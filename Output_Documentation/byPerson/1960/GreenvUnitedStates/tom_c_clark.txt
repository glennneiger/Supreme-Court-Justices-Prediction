justice
tom
c.
clark
(inaudible)
they
asked
questions?
justice
tom
c.
clark
where
that
has
counsel,
they
ask
questions
ordinarily
do
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
mr.
kramer
because
there
is
a
feeling
among
certain
defendants
if
they
got
a
lesser
sentence
if
they
do
not
have
a
lawyer.
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
you've
gone
to
a
federal
court
on
hoping
that
a
term
on
the
sentence
and
we'll
see
most
of
the
time
(inaudible)
my
way
that
over
half
of
them
do
not
have
lawyers
because
they
feel
that
the
judge
will
be
more
lenient
with
them
in
its
sentence.
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
about
this
sentiment
of
the
judges,
do
you
think
that
the
reason
that
judge
aldrich
and
judge
ford
indicates
that
or
have
not
asked
this
question
directly
to
defendants
rather
to
lawyers
and
because
this
rule
gives
us
the
word
of
ford
to
defend
an
opportunity
or
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
do
they
have,
as
you
indicate
to
my
mind,
just
a
feeling
against
asking
that
question
or
against
the
rule
itself?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
learned
more
from
the
lawyer?
