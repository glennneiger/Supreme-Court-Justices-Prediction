justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
satisfied,
i'm
curious,
for
the
court
to
say,
"i
will
now
hear
from
the
defendant,"
and
then
his
counsel
gets
up
and
speaks,
does
that
discharge
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
that's
why
i'm
asking.
well,
did
he
ask
counsel
what
i
did
and
i
think
what
every
district
judge
do
say,
"i
would
now
hear
from
the
defendant,
if
he
wishes
to
be
heard,
before
sentence
is
imposed,"
and
the
lawyer
then
gets
up
and
makes
his
speech?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
is
there
a
form
for
those
instances
in
which
the
defendant
asked
counsel
and
another
in
those
instances
in
which
they
have
not
done?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
hence,
perhaps,
that
maybe
a
matter
of
importance.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
was
that
awful
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
true
of
his
right
to
be
heard
(inaudible)?
his
right
to
be
heard
and
is
that
not
satisfied
even
on
the
present
(inaudible)
if
you
say
that
counsel?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
rose
under
--
under
pleas
of
guilt,
does
he
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
(inaudible)
is
the
defendant
in
anyway
deprived
of
him
substantive
right
to
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
i
think
that
story
is
--
well,
i
mean
not
all
is
to
their
--
usually
often
done
but
considered
to
be
done
when
you
--
the
judge
says,
"and
i'll
break
the
defendant
(inaudible).
i'll
be
glad
to
hear
from
the
(inaudible)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that
satisfies
him.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
was
--
i'm
curious
to
know,
mr.
vorenberg,
how
do
you
handle
this
situation,
which
i
can
assure
you,
does
happen
(inaudible)
doesn't
make
a
statement,
as
i've
indicated
previously
and
the
defendant
and
lawyer
will
start
to
talk
and
the
defendant
too
will
start
to
talk
and
then
the
lawyer
will
say
to
him,
"now,
you
keep
still."
(inaudible)
lawyers
are
going
to
make
a
speech
and
what
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
if
the
first
one
was
void?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
you
what
would
be
your
view
of
this
situation
and
--
this
or
this
occur
when
justice
(inaudible)
asked
you,
on
a
direct
appeal
is
stated
and
there,
the
state
seems
to
be
quite
(inaudible)
without
prejudice,
is
that
an
answer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that's
what
we're
getting
to.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
there's
a
direct
appeal
when
the
point
is
made
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
then
the
government
chose
under
rule
52,
no
prejudice,
is
that
an
answer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
it
is,
if
it
is
an
answer,
then
the
question
is
not
jurisdictional
and
the
judgment
isn't
void,
near
error,
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
your
view
that
in
most
cases
in
a
federal
court
from
pleas
of
guilty,
defendant
does
not
have
counsel?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
none
--
in
most
cases.
