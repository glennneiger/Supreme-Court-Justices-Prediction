mr.
vorenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
if
there
are
any
states
in
--
in
which
a
man
would
be
considered
a
multiple
offender
by
reason
of
these
three
convictions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kramer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
government
object
to
the
adoption
of
such
a
rule
prospect
of
which?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
should
be
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
are
--
there's
a
conflict.
there's
a
clear
conflict
in
the
--
in
the
circuits
on
this
--
on
this
matter,
why
couldn't
we
do
it
by
resolving
a
conflict?
surely,
the
--
surely,
this
rule
is
not
so
ambiguous
that
it
could
be
said,
we
couldn't
resolve
the
conflict
in
--
in
favor
of
the
contention
of
petitioner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
before
you
leave
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
one
may
i
ask
you
if
at
this
time
in
the
district
of
columbia
all
district
judges
are
required
to
ask
the
defendant
personally
if
he
has
something
to
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
isn't
very
ambiguous,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wouldn't
suffice
him,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
rule
has
an
existence
there
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
not
count
if
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
the
court
below
indicate
that
it
thought
it
would
did
much
better
policy
if
he
had
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
probably
that
it
--
this
would
be
more
--
the
rule
would
be
more
necessary
in
cases
where
there
is
no
appeal,
where
a
man
pleads
guilty
and
his
--
he
stands
before
the
court,
the
courts
never
heard
him
speak
and
had
no
opportunity
to
see
him
and
he
can't
appeal
because
he's
just
--
he
just
pled
guilty.
but
certainly,
he
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
at
that
time
to
say
what
he
wants
to
say
in
his
own
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
court
for
the
protection
of
the
record
itself
would
--
would
always
do
this
because
we
have
so
many
court-appointed
counsel
and
--
and
counsels
appointed
on
the
same
day
of
the
arraignment
and
the
--
the
lawyer
speaks
to
the
defendants
just
a
few
moments
and
he
said,
"well,
you
--
you
admit
your
guilty,"
and
--
and
so
they
walked
up
and
--
and
counsel
pleads
him
guilty
and
then,
"have
you
anything
to
say?"
well,
the
lawyer
--
the
lawyer
is
not
in
the
position
to
say
very
much
under
those
circumstances
if
--
if
a
question
is
put
directly
to
the
defendant,
he
might
have
much
that
he
could
say
in
--
in
a
few
words
that
would
cause
the
--
the
judge
to
--
to
distinguish
perhaps
between
him
and
the
dangerous
criminal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
have
an
idea
that
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
and
even
the
district
court
will
waste
more
time
determining
whether
in
--
in
specific
cases,
a
man
is
well
represented
and
his
attorney
was
articulate
and
--
and
energetic
before
he
determines
whether
--
whether
he's
been
prejudiced
and
he
would
be
to
just
let
them
--
just
ask
that
question
all
the
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
am
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
understand
your
difference.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
think
the
other
two
would
fall
but
that
one
would
stand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
may
i
ask
--
ask
mr.
vorenberg,
if
he
--
would
you
like
to
finish
tonight,
so
you
have
a
few
moments
later,
would
you
rather
do
that
and
come
back
tomorrow
morning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
counsel
--
there's
only
going
to
be
a
few
moments,
we
--
we
might
finish
it
tonight.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
you
have
not.
you
have
about
15
minutes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
should
you
like
to
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
we'd
better
go
over
until
tomorrow.

theodore
green
versus

mr.
kramer,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vorenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vorenberg,
before
you
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
to
you
for
undertaking
this
assignment
for
this
indigent
defendant.
you
approached
it
conscientiously
and
ably,
and
the
court
is
indebted
to
you
for
it.
mr.
kramer,
we
also
appreciate
of
course
the
very
diligent,
earnest,
and
frank
matter
in
which
you
represented
the
government
in
this
case.
