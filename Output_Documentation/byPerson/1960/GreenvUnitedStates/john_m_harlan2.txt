is
this
man
was
convicted
in
1952?
justice
john
m.

1951.
when
did
he
first
make
this
contention?
justice
john

1959.

of
course,
the
form
is
consistent
with
the
other
point
of
view.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
"defendant".
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
did
that
as
a
result
of
exercising
their
supervisory
of
powers
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
rather
than
construing
the
rule.
justice
john

it
might
be
very
embarrassing
to
counsel
sometimes
to
be
put
in
that
position
where
you
--
last
thing
you
want
him
to
have
his
client
get
up
and
make
speech
to
begin.

(voice

--
justice

this
maybe
anticipating
but
it
bears
on
this
point,
do
you
draw
a
distinction
between
this
situation
and
the
argument
that
you
make
later
on,
will
make
later
on
as
to
the
error
and
the
charge
underlying
count
3?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
this
--
you
think
this
is
an
easier
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wish
you
could
explain
why
you
think
it's
so
much
easier.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
at
least
enlighten
me,
put
it
that
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
argument
also
goes
with
the
allocution
point?
