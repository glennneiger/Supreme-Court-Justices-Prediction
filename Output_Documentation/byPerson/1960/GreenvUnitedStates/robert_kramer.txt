mr.
robert
kramer
may
it
please
the
--
the
court.
following
the
pattern
set
by
the
very
able
counsel
for
petitioner
here,
i'll
first
speak,
unless
the
court
wishes
otherwise,
on
the
point
raised
in
no.
70,
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
trial
judge
here
erred
when
he
did
not
expressly
ask
the
petitioner
just
before
sentencing
whether
petitioner
himself
wished
to
say
anything.
in
that
connection,
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
wished
to
stress
even
though
they
have
been
brought
out
here
in
the
discussion
before.
the
first,
of
course,
is
that
petitioner
here
was
represented
throughout
his
trial.
he
did
not
plead
guilty.
he
stood
trial
and
had
a
full
trial.
and
throughout
this
trial,
he
was
represented
by
counsel
of
his
own
choice,
not
by
court-appointed
counsel.
and
his
counsel
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
twice
mentioned
in
the
fact
in
its
opinion
below,
was
an
able,
experienced
trial
lawyer
and
judging
by
everything
that
appears
in
the
record
here,
he
conducted
a
very
alert
and
vigorous
defense
and
assertion
of
all
the
rights
of
petitioner.
the
record
here
shows
he
took
exceptions
of
the
charges.
the
record
here
shows
he
argued
at
length
on
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
for
new
trial.
and
there's
every
indication
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
he
was
an
able,
experienced,
confident
criminal
trial
lawyer.
the
court
mentioned
that
twice
in
his
opinion
found
in
the
record
on
page
35,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
a
prior
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
256
f.2d
484,
involving
the
same
defendant
but
the
way
this
is
--
these
two
motions
here
are
only
the
last
two
of
four
that
he
has
made
since
he
has
began
serving
his
sentence.
in
this
prior
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
again
said,
"green
was
represented
by
an
able
and
experienced
criminal
trial
lawyer
of
his
own
choice."
again,
as
was
brought
here,
his
able
counsel
spoke
on
the
point
of
mitigation
of
sentence.
he
spoke
in
response
to
a
direct
question
put
by
the
judge.
the
judge
asked
if
the
conclusion
of
the
arguments
and
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
you
have
anything
further.
now,
the
record
does
not
expressly
show,
unfortunately,
to
whom
he
was
speaking
when
he
said
"you".
i
would
assume
probably
it
was
counsel.
at
any
rate,
defendant's
counsel
then
spoke
up.
he's
--
what
he
said
covers
a
page
and
a
half
in
the
record.
he
was
followed
by
counsel
for
the
codefendant,
who
also
spoke
on
the
problem
of
sentencing.
in
other
words,
both
counsels
for
both
defendants
in
answer
to
inquiry
by
the
judge
spoke
on
the
problem
of
sentence.
so
far
as
appears,
they
said
everything
it
was
to
be
said.
by
that,
i
mean
the
united
states
attorney
had
previously
spoke
his
remarks
cover
about
a
page
in
the
record
on
the
question
of
sentencing.
when
the
two
co-counsel
spoke
here,
they
answered
directly
the
statements
made
by
the
united
states
attorney,
that
is,
they
pointed
out
that
defendant
here
was
a
family
man.
he
had
two
minor
children
and
a
wife
and
that
whenever
he
had
been
able
physically
to
do
so,
he
had
supported
them.
they
also
pointed
out
that
this
particular
defendant
was
by
no
means
a
stranger
to
the
state
and
federal
criminal
courts.
and
that
if
the
judge,
judge
ford
imposed
a
long
sentence
here
because
of
the
other
pending
indictments,
because
of
the
fact
he
was
already
in
the
state
prison
under
a
conviction,
that
it
would
mean
substantially
that
the
defendant
would
spend
most
of
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison.
now,
counsel
brought
that
out
speaking
at
length.
another
point
i
want
to
make
is
that,
so
far
as
we
can
tell
it
from
the
record,
and
the
record
i
think
is
fairly
convincing,
the
defendant
here
was
fully
confident
in
every
way
to
cooperate
with
his
counsel
in
his
defense.
by
that,
i
mean
he
was
a
man
of
37
years.
he
was
not
a
juvenile.
he
was
not
senile.
there's
no
suggestion
in
anytime
there's
any
impairment
of
his
mental
capacity.
moreover,
as
i
mentioned,
he
was
not
a
stranger
to
courtrooms,
criminal
trials
and
court
proceedings.
he'd
been
through
them
all
before.
in
addition,
what's
happened
since
his
trial
here,
gives
every
indication
that
in
many
ways,
he's
an
unusually
resourceful
and
articulate
person.
as
i've
mentioned,
since
his
conviction
and
since
he's
going
to
alcatraz,
he's
filed
no
less
than
four
post
conviction
motions.
each
one,
he
filed
himself,
many
of
them
he
rolled
up
the
papers
in
longhand.
he
carried
them,
all
four,
through
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
first
circuit
and
three
of
them,
he
brought
here
asking
for
certiorari.
all
the
papers
he
prepared
himself.
so,
there's
every
indication
here
that
defendant
was
fully
competent
and
also
this
record,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
indicates
that
the
defendant
was,
so
to
speak,
talking
and
working
with
his
own
counsel
during
the
trial.
by
that,
i
mean
if
you
look
at
the
record,
you
discover
the
united
states
attorney,
as
i
said,
spoke
about
a
page
in
the
record
about
what
the
sentence
should
be.
the
united
states
attorney
stressed
the
fact
that
though
the
defendant
had
these
two
minor
children
and
wife,
he
never
actually
supported
them.
when
the
defendant's
counsel
spoke
on
this
question
of
the
sentence
in
response
to
an
inquiry
from
judge
ford,
he
made
a
very
significant
remark
showing
that
he
was
not
unaware
of
the
defendant's
point
of
view
so
to
speak.
on
the
record
in
page
19,
he
made
this
remark,
notwithstanding
what
the
district
attorney
has
said.
"he,"
meaning
the
defendant,
"informed
me
that,
he,"
meaning
the
defendant
"has
supported
them,"
meaning
his
family,
"except
for
the
time
he
was
incapacitated".
in
other
words,
he
was
--
he
was
conferring
with
his
counsel
during
all
this
that
was
going
on.
he
was
not
sitting
there
tongue-tied.
he
was
not
so
shy
and
bashful.
he
was
not
unaware
of
what
was
happening.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
it's
certainly
the
presupposition
of
what
i'm
talking
about
now.
and
the
reason
i
do
that,
mr.
justice,
is
this,
counsel
for
the
other
side
said
that
there
is
a
division
of
judicial
authority
on
this
point.
that
is
true
in
one
sense
of
the
word,
but
in
at
least
two
respects,
i
think,
there
has
been
no
division
of
authority.
and
one
of
the
two
respects
is
this,
so
far
as
i
am,
at
least
in
every
case
that's
cited
in
the
briefs
here
and
i
presume
they've
probably
represented
every
reported
opinion,
whatever
this
issue
has
been
raised
before
any
judge,
he
has
always
gone
to
great
length
to
see
if
there
is
any
indication
of
actual
real
prejudice
to
the
defendant.
now,
that
was
done
here
in
this
case.
the
district
judge,
justice
aldrich
pointed
out
the
facts
that
i'm
pointing
out.
here
is
a
defendant,
fully
confident,
counsel
of
his
own
choice,
competent
counsel,
counsel
spoke
on
the
question
of
sentencing,
defendant
was
there
all
the
time,
conferred
with
his
counsel,
no
indication
the
defendant
wanted
to
speak,
no
indication
what
defendant
would
have
said.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
affirming
here,
took
exactly
the
same
position.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
in
every
case
cited
in
our
brief,
every
judge
who's
passed
on
this
point
has
felt
no
matter
what
was
the
literal
meaning
or
impact
of
rule
32
(a).
that
in
order
to
be
sensitive,
to
be
certain
that
no
defendant
had
really
been
hurt
or
harmed,
he
must
look
into
the
factual
picture
and
see
whether
there
was
any
actual
prejudice.
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
every
judge
who,
as
i
say,
who
has
written
an
opinion
that's
been
reported
on
this
point.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
its
argument
did
whether
or
not
it
still
does
today,
perhaps,
is
debatable.
but
that,
i
think,
brings
me
to
another
point,
which
is
already
been
touched
on
here
and
which
i
think,
perhaps,
is
a
point
that
has
also
troubled
every
court
or
judge
who
has
been
called
upon
to
handle
this
matter.
and
that
is
simply
this.
it's
quite
true,
as
defendant's
very
able
counsel
has
pointed
out,
that
looking
at
this
thing
prospectively,
one
can
say,
"well,
this
is
no
great
burden
on
a
trial
judge."
it
takes
only
--
made
--
most
cases
going
to
take
a
minute
of
his
time
because
frequently
the
defendant
won't
say
anything.
if
the
defendant
does
reply
why,
that's
all
to
the
government,
so
what
possible
harm
is
there
in
imposing
an
absolute
rule
and
saying
it
is
mandatory
and
you
either
do
it
or
else.
now,
that
is
the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
prospectively.
when
you
do
it
prospectively,
it
is
quite
true
there
will
be
no
serious
interference
with
the
orderly
processes
of
the
criminal
court.
but
when
you
do
what
the
petitioner
seeks
here,
when
you
attempt
to
make
this
interpretation
of
what
apparently
is
an
ambiguous
rule,
judging
by
the
remarks
of
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
by
what
judge
ford
did
here,
when
you
make
such
an
interpretation
of
an
admittedly
ambiguous
rule
mandatory
retrospectively,
then
it
seems
to
the
government,
and
this
is
what
troubles
the
government
very
much,
that
you
really
get
into
very
serious
difficulties
in
the
administration
of
criminal
law.
you
do
so,
i
think,
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
supposed
this
court
remands
the
case
as
petitioner
seeks
for
resentence,
that
will
mean
that
a
district
judge,
presumably
judge
ford,
over
eight
years
after
the
original
conviction
will
be
called
upon
to
resentence
this
defendant.
that,
i
should
judge,
would
not
be
altogether
an
easy
thing
to
do.
and
then
there
is
the
second
thing.
if
relief
has
given
this
petitioner
here,
you're
not
simply
doing
what
most
courts
have
done,
leaving
the
door
open
for
a
showing
that
when
there's
been
any
--
any
actual
prejudice,
when
anybody's
been
actually
hurt,
relief
will
be
given.
but
quite
literally
it
seems
to
me,
you're
taking
the
door
off
its
hinges
and
throwing
it
away.
by
that
i
mean,
as
the
court
has
already
brought
out,
every
single
prisoner,
who
is
still
serving
his
sentence
under
the
theory
advanced
by
petitioner,
would
be
entitled
then
to
raise
this
point
and
to
obtain
a
remand
for
resentencing
no
matter
how
long
ago
he
may
have
been
convicted.
mr.
robert
kramer
it
would
not
necessarily
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
open
the
prison
doors.
mr.
robert
kramer
no,
i
don't
mean
open
the
doors
to
the
--
to
the
prison.
i
mean
you
would
open
the
door
to
allow
him
to
come
into
court
and
raise
this
question
and
obtain
a
remand
for
sentencing.
i
do
not
mean
they
would
go
free.
no,
i
agree
with
you.
perhaps
i
misled
you
by
my
statement.
mr.
robert
kramer
not
in
the
least,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
i
will
say
this,
i
personally
think
so.
i
understand
that
there's
a
division
of
opinion
on
that
point
among
the
trial
judges
and
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
wise
to
obtain
their
views
on
it
before
or
at
least
this
court
might
wish
to
before
making
such
a
mandatory
rule
but
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
we
would
have
no
objection
whatsoever
to
the
promulgation
of
such
a
rule
prospectively.
and
this
might
be
a
very
good
time
because
you
are
well
aware
all
the
rules
are
now
under
study
for
possible
revision.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
they
would
seem
to
me,
however,
and
i'm
not
quite
certain.
if
you
mean
resolve
the
conflict
by
doing
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
the
couch
case
by
saying
"hereafter",
it
will
be
done
this
way.
the
government
would
have
no
objection.
if
you
mean
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
way
that
the
petitioner
seeks
here,
by
saying
this
is
what
the
rule
now
means,
has
always
been
and
will
always
mean
in
the
future,
then,
for
the
reasons
i've
stated,
the
government
does
very
strongly
object
because
we
think
quite
frankly
that
it
will
put
a
very
serious
burden
on
the
lower
federal
court.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
there
are
--
mr.
robert
kramer
no,
in
my
knowledge,
there
are
none.
mr.
robert
kramer
there
are
six
courts
of
appeals.
the
first
in
this
case,
the
fifth,
sixth,
ninth,
tenth
and
district
of
columbia.
in
addition,
there
are
two
proud
judges
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
who
have
passed
on
it.
now,
i
say
there
is
no
conflict,
i
meant
on
two
points.
first,
there's
no
conflict
but
that
every
judge,
even
when
he
has
denied
relief
to
a
given
petition,
has
very
carefully
examined
the
record.
second,
i
say
there
is
no
conflict
because
no
judge,
even
a
judge
who
was
not
fully
agreed
with
the
rest
of
his
court,
has
ever
said
that
under
the
circumstances
here
where
the
relief
is
sought,
not
prospectively,
not
by
a
direct
appeal
but
under
rule
35,
no
judge
has
ever
been
willing
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
we
should
give
retroactive
relief
to
the
extent
that
it
would
be
available
if
it
were
given
under
rule
35.
let
me
illustrate
that
by
discussing
briefly
the
two
cases
which
i
think,
so
to
speak,
are
most
favorable
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
to
the
petitioners.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
one
might,
perhaps,
use
some
such
language
as
is
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
is
the
new
york
group
on
this
point.
the
advisory
committee
when
they
drafted
this
rule,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
referred
to
the
new
york
rule
but
they
referred
to
it
simply
for
purposes
of
comparison.
the
new
york
rule
is
found
page
20
of
our
brief
and
the
new
york
rule
says
when
the
defendant
appears
for
judgment,
he
must
be
asked
by
the
clerk
whether
he
had
any
legal
cause
to
show
why
judgment
should
not
be
pronounced
against
him.
mr.
robert
kramer
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
that
would
seem
to
me
to
be
less
mandatory
than
the
new
york
rule.
however,
i
must
be
honestly
and
here
make,
perhaps,
a
slight
collection
--
correction
in
a
statement
made
in
the
very
excellent
brief
filed
by
petitioner,
"not
every
new
york
court
has
held
the
even
under
that
language,
it
is
mandatory."
not
every
rule.
not
everyone.
the
--
the
sheenan
(ph)
case
which
we
cite
direct,
there
on
page
20
of
our
brief
is
a
ruling
by
a
trial
judge
in
new
york
who
held
that
even
under
that
light,
it
was
not
mandatory
that
the
right
could
be
waived
under
the
very
circumstances
involved
in
our
case.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
let
--
let
me
stress
and
just
discuss
briefly
these
two
cases
would
seem
to
me,
as
i
say,
most
favorable
to
the
petitioner
and
yet,
i
do
not
think
actually
would
grant
relief
here.
one
is
the
couch
case,
cited
in
our
brief

eight
judges
of
the
district
of
columbia
sat
on
that
case.
the
ruling
of
the
court
was
that
the
rule
should
be
mandatory
but
only
prospectively.
now,
that
was
a
case
that
came
up
under
so-called
collateral
attack,
not
by
a
way
of
direct
appeal.
two
of
the
eight
judges
dissented
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
think
the
rule
should
be
made
mandatory
even
in
the
future.
four
of
the
judges
in
a
specially
concurring
opinion
indicate
that
the
main
reason
they
wish
to
have
the
rule
prospective
only
in
the
couch
case,
was
the
very
point
i've
been
stressing
here,
that
this
was
not
a
direct
appeal.
it
was
a
collateral
proceeding
under
rule
35
or
else
28
u.s.c.
2255
and
that
they
were
afraid
that
if
they
did
not
make
the
rule
prospective
only
at
least
in
such
a
collateral
attack,
it
would
have
a
rather
devastating
effect
on
the
federal
courts.
now,
they
did
indicate,
though
they,
of
course,
it
was
not
a
square
holding
that
if
this
had
been
a
direct
appeal,
they
might
have
been
willing
to
make
the
rule
retroactive
to
that
extent.
now,
the
taylor
case
has
been
mentioned.
let
me
briefly
point
out.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
would
assume
so
because
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
couch
case
was
to
this
effect,
that
we
will
hold
it
reversible
error
even
on
the
collateral
attack
if
any
defendant
sentenced
after
our
opinion
in
this
case
has
not
been
asked
this
question.
now,
i
do
not
know
the
actual
practice
whether
the
district
judges
are
conforming
to
it
but
i
would
assume
they
are.
mr.
robert
kramer
no,
they
left
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
robert
kramer
now,
the
taylor
case,
it
--
nine
judges
sat
on
that.
five
--
this
and
the
taylor
case
was
a
direct
appeal.
it
was
not
a
so-called
collateral
attack
under
either
rule
35
or
section
2255
of
title
28.
it
was
a
direct
appeal.
five
of
the
judges
writing
the
opinion
of
the
court,
ruled
that
this
was
a
right
that
could
be
waived,
waived
under
such
circumstances
as
we
have
here
where
defendant
is
represented
by
counsel
of
his
own
choice
and
where
counsel
actually
speaks
on
this
question
of
sentence.
however,
they
held
that
there
was
no
waiver
under
the
facts
of
that
particular
case.
four
of
the
judges
specially
concurred,
indicated
that
they
did
not
think
when
the
question
came
up
by
way
of
direct
appeal
as
it
did
in
the
taylor
case
that
the
right
should
be
held
waiver.
they
very
carefully
indicated,
however,
that
if
this
were
a
matter
of
collateral
attack,
as
is
our
case,
that
then
they
might
want
to
think
long
and
hard
about
making
any
sort
of
non-waiver
rule.
now,
as
i
say,
as
far
as
i
know,
those
are
two
most
favorable
decisions
and
neither
one
of
them
would
go
so
far
as
the
petitioner
asked
you
to
go
here.
petitioner
asked
you
here
under
circumstances
that
many
courts
would
say
amounted
to
a
waiver.
that's
what
the
majority
would've
said
in
the
taylor
case,
namely
petitioner
has
counsel
of
his
choice,
who
is
competent,
who
speaks
on
the
question
of
sentencing.
petitioner
is
there
and
present
in
court,
conferring
with
his
counsel
and
there's
not
the
slightest
indication
anywhere
in
the
record
that
petitioner
actually
wanted
to
speak.
now,
that
point
was
stressed
by
both
courts
below.
mr.
robert
kramer
not
first
--
not
when
they
said,
prospectively
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
no.
mr.
robert
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
kramer
that's
right.
well,
the
district
judge
emphasized
out
in
this
case.
the
--
his
opinion
in
the
record
at
page
30.
he
said,
"even
now,
he,"
that
is
the
defendant,
"does
not
say
that
he
wanted
to
say
anything
at
the
time
or
what
he
would
have
said".
and
the
court
of
appeals
stressed
that
point
here
in
this
case.
they
said
again,
quoting
from
their
opinion
in
the
record
at
page
36,
"nor
is
there
any
indication
in
the
present
motion
or
supporting
brief
as
to
what
if
anything,
green
might've
been
able
to
add
in
elaboration
of
the
statements
of
his
counsel."
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
honestly
don't
know.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
this,
i
made
some
inquiry
before
i
prepared,
while
i
was
preparing
this
argument
and
i
was
told
in
general
as
far
as
the
department
of
justice
was
concerned,
as
far
as
our
criminal
division
was
concerned
that
they
would
have
absolutely
no
objection
to
a
prospective
rule
here
that
would
make
it
mandatory.
but
i
was
also
cautioned
that
this
was
a
matter
and
the
informants
said,
just
as
you
did,
we
don't
quite
understand
it
but
it
is
a
matter
on
which
some
district
judges
have
quite
pronounced
opinion.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
i
would
point
this
fact
out
that
again
in
the
--
apparently,
i
don't
know
how
judge
ford
would
feel
about
but
apparently
judge
ford,
judging
by
his
conduct
in
this
case,
took
the
position
somewhat
similar
to
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
that
he
did
not
need
to
ask
the
question
here
directly
of
the
defendant
on
the
circumstance.
judge
aldrich
who
wrote
the
--
the
lower
court
opinion
here
passing
directly
on
this
motion
indicated
in
the
footnote
to
his
opinion
that
he
too,
as
he
phrased
it,
only
occasionally,
directly
asked
the
defendant
this
point.
now,
there
--
those
are,
so
to
speak,
two
district
judges.
unfortunately,
as
brought
out
--
mr.
robert
kramer
i
don't
believe
--
mr.
robert
kramer
no.
mr.
robert
kramer
all
--
all
i
was
trying
to
bring
out
was
that
i
would
not
like
to
foreclose
the
district
judges
if
they
wish
to
say
something
on
--
mr.
robert
kramer
i
do
not
know.
i
do
not
know,
certainly.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
the
court
below
indicated
that
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
several
courts
have
indicated
that,
at
the
same
time
though,
refusing
to
give
relief.
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
many
court
in
a
situation
such
as
this
about
giving
relief
is
the
vast
retroactive
effect
because
i
think
most
court
of
appeal
judges
are
aware
of
this
that
there
are
a
good
many
trial
judges
like
judge
ford
and
judge
aldrich
who
have
not
been
in
every
instance
asking
this
question
directly
of
the
defendant.
and
they
are
afraid
that
if
they
give
retroactive
relief,
particularly
if
they
give
it
when
it
--
there
is
not
a
direct
appeal
but
a
so-called
collateral
attack
that
it
may
have
very
serious
repercussions
on
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
your
honor,
i
should
like
to
reserve
an
opinion
on
that
because
i,
myself,
would
be
inclined
to
say
that
considering
the
fact,
how
apparently
so
many
of
the
trial
judges
have
been,
shall
i
say,
misled
by
the
language
of
the
present
rule
whether
they
should've
been
or
not,
i
don't
know.
i
would
wonder
whether
you
should
even
give
that
much
retroactive
effect,
namely
giving
relief
by
way
of
direct
appeal
unless
there
has
been
an
actual
showing
of
prejudice.
mr.
robert
kramer
but
i
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
i
should
think
it
would
be.
i
should
think
it
would
be
at
this
time.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
would
agree
entirely
with
what
you're
saying,
sir,
and
of
course,
in
most
cases,
he
pleads
guilty,
the
man
does
not
have
counsel,
which
i
think
is
a
very
important
factor.
i
think
--
mr.
robert
kramer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
do
not
know.
i
would
hope
so.
i
do
--
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
in
a
great
many
that's
true,
is
it
not?
mr.
robert
kramer
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
it
would
depend
on
nature
of
defense.
i
--
it's,
of
course,
it's
a
capital
offense.
they
would
have
to
have
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
kramer
in
many
of
those
offenses
--
in
many
cases,
i
would
imagine,
however,
that
the
counsel
might
well
be
court
appointed
and
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
robert
kramer
i
have
been
told
that.
i
cannot
vouch
for
the
truth
of
it.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
--
mr.
robert
kramer
i
don't
as
--
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
have
any
feeling
against
the
rule
except
it
is
possible
some
of
them
think
that
in
effect
that
(a)
it
might
encourage
some
defendants
to
speak
up
and
to
speak
rather
at
length
and
that
the
defendants
might
very
well
not
say
much
of
anything
to
the
point,
it
might
constitute
inadvertent
upon
the
court's
time.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
i
think
it's
pretty
plain
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
that
is
exactly
what
judge
ford
felt.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
robert
kramer
that's
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
here
that
the
judge
refused
to
impose
sentence
on
the
day
the
verdict
was
returned
even
though
counsel
said
they
were
ready
to
proceed
and
one
of
the
reasons
he
gave,
one
of
two
reasons
was
that
he
wished
time
for
the
pre-sentence
report
to
be
completed
and
to
have
time
to
study.
he
also
wished
to
have
time
to
consider
the
motions
for
a
new
trial
and
an
arrest
of
judgement.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
i
think
that
is
why
both
the
district
judge
here,
district
judge
aldrich
and
the
court
of
appeals
stressed
the
fact
that
this
man
not
only
had
a
competent
experienced
lawyer
but
one
of
his
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
own
choice
and
that
they
--
they
took
for
granted,
of
course,
the
fact
that
he
had
not
pled
guilty
and
he
had
a
full
trial.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
i
think
it's
--
certainly
is
prior
to
making
a
prospective
rule
is
concerned
that
that
argument
is
--
mr.
robert
kramer
--
quite
sound.
mr.
robert
kramer
and
that
--
that
is
the
position
taken,
i
might
say,
by
the
four
judges
who
concurred
specially
in
the
taylor
case
in
the
ninth
circuit,
exactly
your
position.
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
now
to
speak
briefly
as
the
petitioner's
counsel
about
the
issues
raised
in
no.
179.
the
first
issue
there,
as
petitioner's
counsel
had
pointed
out,
is
whether
or
not,
because
of
the
fact
and
the
government
concedes
as
petitioner's
counsel
says
that
there
was
actually,
after
the
jury's
verdict
of
conviction
on
all
three
counts,
only
one
offense
here.
whatever
language
you
use,
whether
counts
1
and
2
were
varies
under
count
3
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
there's
no
argument
about
that.
that
was
recognized
by
the
district
judge
below
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
also.
but
where
the
difficulty
comes
is
in
this
problem
of
sentence
because
the
argument
that
petitioner
has
made,
as
we
understand
it,
is
simply
this,
petitioner
says,
"when
the
judge
went
to
sentence,"
as
was
natural,
"he
imposed
20
years,
count
1,
20
years,
count
2,
25
years,
count
3,
all
to
run
concurrently."
and
because
he
happened
to
impose
first,
a
20-year
sentence
under
count
1
and
then
another
one
under
count
2,
he
had,
so
to
speak,
exhausted
his
power
of
sentencing
because
there
is
only
one
offense
here
and
therefore,
the
25-year
sentence,
which
was
the
one
he
pronounced
last,
was
null
and
void.
well,
of
course,
we
are
dealing
here
you
understand
not
with
consecutive
sentences
but
with
concurrent.
one
point
i
wish
stress
is
that
i
do
not
believe
it's
fair
to
say
the
trial
judge
here
did
not
realize
the
actual
situation
in
his
charge
to
the
jury,
found
on
pages
9
and
10.
he
twice
referred
to
the
fact
that
count
3
was
not
really
a
separate
offense.
it
was
merely
an
aggregated
form
of
the
other
counts.
also,
in
the
--
in
dealing
with
the
motions
made
in
arrest
of
judgement
where
this
point
was
brought
out,
though
not
in
the
form
that
is
quite
brought
out
here,
the
trial
judge
again
indicate
that
he
realized
the
problem
involved.
unfortunately,
he
made
a
technical
error
and
that
he
imposed
three
concurrent
sentences
when,
properly
speaking,
he
should
have
imposed
only
one
sentence
presumably
one
on
the
third
count
on
which
the
jury
had
convicted,
the
aggravated
to
come.
where
we
part
company,
however,
with
petitioner
here
is
that
we
do
not
think
this
court
should
adopt
any
such
automatic
rule
as
that
when
you
have
a
situation
such
as
this,
it
is
the
first
sentence
which
the
judge
pronounced,
so
to
speak,
that
stands
and
all
the
others
are
void.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
so
far
as
we
know,
although
this
question
has
been
raised
quite
frequently,
no
court
has
ever
reached
that
result.
and
i
think
there
are
some
reasons
for
that.
for
instance,
take
the
o'keefe
case,
which
is
cited
at
page
37
of
our
brief.
the
o'keefe
case
involved
a
situation
very
similar
to
our.
there
were
two
counts,
the
first
count
was
for
a
simple
bank
robbery,
the
second
count
was
for
the
aggravated
offense.
now,
for
some
reasons,
which
doesn't
appear
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
trial
judge
after
a
verdict
of
conviction
on
both
counts
happened
to
pronounce
sentence
first
on
count
2.
he
just
happened
to.
the
answer
really,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
answer
that
the
district
judge
wyzanski
made
when
he
was
dealing
with
this
point,
it's
found
in
--
in
his
opinion
on
page
2
of
the
record.
he
said,
"the
true
situation
actually
is
that
in
one
document,
judge
ford
simultaneously
imposed
upon
the
defendant
this
sentence.
it's
not
accurate
to
say
actually
that
he
imposed
them
in
--
in
point
of
time
at
different
problems.
it's
a
simultaneous
thing."
now,
again,
we
also
do
not
relate
that
the
series
should
be
adopted
which
petitioner
has
suggested,
namely
that
this
court
should
follow
the
idea
in
a
situation
such
as
this
of
affirming
the
lightest
sentence
only.
again,
that
argument
was
made
below
and
the
answer,
i
think,
is
contained
in
the
sentence
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
found
in
the
record
at
page
28
stating
that
this
--
this
same
argument
have
made
repeatedly
to
courts
of
appeal.
and
in
every
instance,
the
sentence
in
the
count
which
carried
with
it
the
greater
penalty
was
held
valid.
and
we
cite
on
pages
37
in
our
brief
the
several
of
--
only
a
few
actions
of
the
many
cases
which
have
done
this.
now,
this
situation
seems
to
us
to
differ
very
decidedly
from
the
situation
in
the
yates
case,
which
was
referred
to
here
by
petitioner.
in
the
yates
case,
not
only
do
you
have
11
counts
but
more
important
than
that,
it
was
quite
clear
in
the
yates
case
that
the
trial
judge
mistakenly
but
genuinely
believe
that
each
count
was
a
separate
distinct
offense.
that
is
not
true
here.
the
trial
judge
realized
that
count
3
was
just
the
aggravated
form
of
the
other
counts.
unfortunately,
as
i
say,
he
was
mistaken
in
the
method
he
tried
to
handle
it,
namely
by
imposing
three
concurrent
sentences.
but
i
think
it's
fair
from
reading
the
remarks
of
the
trial
judge
to
conclude
that
what
he
meant
to
do,
even
though
he
did
it
inartistic,
was
to
impose
for
the
whole
transact
for
the
one
offense
which
the
jury
had
returned
a
verdict
of
conviction,
the
aggravated
form
of
bank
robbery,
a
sentence
of
25-year.
that's
what
he
meant
to
do.
now,
he
did
it,
i
grant
you,
in
an
inartistic
manner.
mr.
robert
kramer
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
the
government
would
--
have
no
objection
whatsoever
if
this
court
should
void
the
two
concurrent
20-year
sentence.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
unwilling
to
do
so
because
it
thought
that
the
two
concurrent
--
two
shorter
concurrent
sentences
in
no
way
prejudiced
the
petitioner.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
i
have
attempted
--
i
inquired
about
that
and
the
point
is
discussed
briefly
in
--
in
our
brief
and
also,
it
is
raised
in
the
brief
of
petitioner.
and
unfortunately,
it's
raised
in
our
brief
on
footnote
10
on
page
37.
unfortunately,
as
near
as
i
can
tell,
the
courts
of
appeal
have
somewhat
differ.
as
i
understand
the
situation
is
this,
the
board
of
parole
frequently
do
take
into
account
the
fact
there
have
been
multiple
sentences
but
almost
always
that
is
where
the
multiple
sentences
are
given
for
different
transactions
at
different
time.
on
the
other
hand,
most
court
of
--
most
boards
of
parole,
as
my
understanding,
no
one
up
above
the
legal
situation,
so
that
in
the
case
such
as
this,
they
would
realize,
there
was
only
one
offense.
mr.
robert
kramer
well
again,
i
should
think
that
like
boards
of
parole,
this
fact
would
be
taken
to
account.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
don't
believe
so.
i'm
not
sure..
he
has
raised
that
point.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
disputed
and
it
certainly
does
not
appear
in
the
record
directly.
if
i
may,
i
should
like
to
take
the
minute
or
two
longer.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
don't
think
i've
actually
exhausted
my
full
hour.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
well,
i
don't
think
i
will
need
perhaps
all
of
that.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
don't
wish
to
intervene
to
either
court
or
counsel.
mr.
robert
kramer
i
might.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
i
might
and
so
i
don't
wish
to
intervene
with
you,
sir.
mr.
robert
kramer
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
speak
just
a
few
moments
about
the
final
point
which
is
raised
by
petitioner
in
179.
that
point
briefly
is
that
because
the
alleged
error
in
the
judge's
charge
to
the
jury,
the
25-year
sentence
under
the
third
column
for
the
aggravated
form
bank
robbery
is
void.
it
seems
to
us,
the
government,
that
this
motion
in
this
respect
similarly
to
the
motion
raised
under
number
70
gives
rise
to
a
rather
serious
question
about
the
orderly
proper
administration
of
the
rules
of
criminal
law
in
the
federal
courts.
that
is
for
this
reason
as
you
will
note
in
the
record
on
pages
18
to
23.
at
the
trial,
petitioners,
able
counsel
took
various
exceptions
to
the
judge's
charge.
none
of
the
exceptions
in
anyway
however,
raised
the
particular
alleged
error
that
is
now
being
asserted
for
the
first
time.
in
addition,
prior
to
this
motion
in
number
179,
petitioner
has
filed
three
other
post-conviction
motions,
one
in
1956,
one
in
1958,
and
the
one
in
number
70,
the
companion
case
here.
and
none
of
those
three
motions
was
this
particular
point
raised
or
with
any
reference
in
any
way
made
to
an
alleged
error
of
any
kind
in
the
judge's
charge.
now
this,
of
course,
is
not
a
proceeding
here
by
direct
appeal.
so
what
it
means
is
that
for
the
first
time
here,
more
than
seven
years
after
the
verdict
and
the
sentence,
the
petitioner
is
attempting
to
assert
an
alleged
error
in
the
trial
judge's
charge
to
the
jury.
now,
as
we
understand
the
petitioner's
argument,
it
runs
somewhat
along
this
line.
this
motion
is
under
rule
35.
rule
35,
of
course,
expressly
says
that
it
is
to
be
used
only
to
correct
in
a
legal
sense.
petitioner
says
therefore,
“we
do
not
attack
the
judgment
of
conviction.
that
is
valid.
we
attack
only
the
25-year
sentence.”
what
is
wrong
with
the
25-year
sentence?
well,
it
is
void
because
of
the
alleged
error
in
the
judge's
charge.
but
what
was
the
effect
of
the
alleged
error
in
the
judge's
charge?
well,
it
voided
the
judgment
of
conviction.
well,
it
seems
to
us
in
effect
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
assert
the
alleged
error
in
the
charge
without
also
in
effect
attacking
the
judgment
of
conviction.
we
just
--
and
that
incidentally
was
the
point
that
troubled
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
kramer
no.
i
mean
the
jury's
verdict.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
under
the
third
count
and
that's
what
i
mean
by
the
per
--
jury's
verdict,
their
judgment.
mr.
robert
kramer
because
it
seems
to
us
what
is
the
vice
in
dissent?
well,
according
to
the
petitioner's
argument,
if
you
look
simply
at
what
you
might
call
the
common
law
record
papers
here,
the
indictment
and
so
on,
there
is
no
right.
mr.
robert
kramer
in
order
to
find
this
error,
you
have
to
look
to
the
judge's
charge.
now,
the
judge's
charge
was
not
in
the
common
law
record.
ordinarily
--
mr.
robert
kramer
yes,
that
is
correct.
but
if
you
simply
look
--
if
we
don't
look
at
the
judge's
charge,
the
verdict
is
good
and
the
sentence
is
good.
you
cannot
find
any
error
in
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
according
to
the
decision
of
this
court
as
we
understand
it
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
is
cited
in
page
42
of
our
brief.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
under
rule
35
as
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts
in
the
bradford
case,
in
the
(inaudible)
case
on
page
41
of
our
brief.
you
look
only
on
what's
known
as
the
common
law
record.
and
that
never
included
the
judge's
charge.
it
did
not
include.
and
that
is
the
point
that
troubled
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
here.
you'll
find
there
in
our
reference
to
that
on
page
27
of
the
record
in
their
judgment.
they
said
rule
35
is
to
correct
an
illegal
sentence.
those
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
and
that
is
that
jury's
verdict
did
not
authorize.
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
as
far
as
i
know
--
mr.
robert
kramer
as
far
as
--
mr.
robert
kramer
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
or
of
any
lower
court
that
has
ever
gone
so
far.
all
the
cases
cited,
for
instance,
in
the
petitioner's
brief
on
pages
34
and
35,
are
just
truly
distinguishable
for
--
for
example,
the
ladner
case
did
not
arise
under
rule
35.
that
arose
under
section
2255.
the
same
is
true
with
the
shelton
case,
the
askins
case
and
the
morgan
case.
the
only
case
cited
in
petitioner's
brief
which
actually
arose
under
35
was
the
hoffman
case.
and
the
error
in
the
hoffman
case
appeared
clearly
simply
from
the
indictment
and
the
judgment
of
the
conviction
of
the
jury.
there
is
no
question
of
the
charge
there,
none
at
all.
now,
of
course,
we
--
the
petitioner
makes
the
point
that
even
if
release
should
not
be
granted
under
rule
35
that
this
court
should
consider
the
case
under
28
u.s.c.
2255
as
an
alternative
avenue
of
approach
so
to
speak.
but
it
seems
to
us
again
that
petitioner
is
in
reality
no
better
off
even
if
this
court
should
wish
to
do
that,
because
again,
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
the
type
of
relief
that
should
be
given
by
way
of
a
collateral
attack
under
section
2255.
and
again,
none
of
the
cases
cited
by
petitioners
actually
so
hold.
one
of
the
main
cases
cited
by
petitioner
is
the
ladner
case.
but
as
the
petitioner
pointed
out
yesterday
in
argument,
this
court
expressly
did
not
pass
on
this
point
in
the
ladner
case,
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
not
raised
it
in
a
timely
fashion.
whether
there's
no
question
what
the
governor
is
--
government
has
raised
the
point
in
number
179
here
before
the
trial
court.
the
record
shows
at
page
two
here
that
the
district
judge
expressly
ruled
against
petitioner
on
this
very
ground.
so
the
ladner
case
is
simply
not
in
point
here.
the
other
cases
cited
by
petitioner
also
are
quite
different.
the
askins
case
for
example
involved
an
indictment
which
showed
on
its
face
that
it
was
outlawed
by
the
statute
of
limitation.
the
morgan
case
involved
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
the
right
to
counsel
which
is
very
different
than
the
right
to
servitude.
none
of
the
cases
actually
that
we
know
of
have
gone
so
far.
in
fact,
we
cite
in
our
brief
half
a
dozen
decisions
of
court
of
appeals
which
are
merely
represented
where
one
court
of
appeal
after
another
has
denied
any
relief
by
way
of
collateral
attack
for
an
alleged
misdirection
by
a
judge
to
adjourn.
the
adams
case
in
page
44
of
our
brief
that
alleged
error
was
about
intoxication
and
burden
of
proof.
relief
denied
because
it
was
by
way
of
collateral
attack.
the
banks
case
alleged
error
and
he
charged
the
jury
about
entrapment.
the
(inaudible)
case
alleged
errors
in
the
charge
about
burden
of
proof
reasonable
doubt.
the
lopez
case
alleged
error
in
the
charge
about
conspiracy.
the
stevens
case
at
page
44
of
our
brief,
very
similar
to
ours
and
that
the
alleged
error
there
related
to
the
definition
of
jeopardy.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
appellate
courts
without
any
dissent
refused
to
give
the
type
of
relief
that
is
sought
here
for
alleged
misdirection
in
an
attack
as
brought
here
collaterally.
and
it
seems
to
us
it
raises
a
very
basic
question
whether
this
type
of
error
can
be
asserted.
many,
many
years
after
the
judgment
of
conviction,
after
the
time
of
appeal
has
expired
by
way
of
an
indirect
attack
so
to
speak
under
either
rule
35
or
28
u.s.c.
2255.
mr.
robert
kramer
yes.
we
do.
we
think
it
definitely
does.
we
recognize
of
course
under
the
allocution
point.
there
is
so
to
speak
more
leeway
because
it
can
be
argued
under
the
allocution
point
as
it's
brought
out
yesterday
by
counsel
for
petition,
that
the
sentence
there
is
illegal
because
there
was
a
violation
of
rule
32
(a).
we
simply
urge
the
court
not
to
so
hold
because
of
the
serious
problems
that
would
raise
in
the
proper
administration
of
criminal
justice
for
the
reasons
i've
developed
yesterday.
mr.
robert
kramer
thank
you,
your
honor.
