mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
in
this
case,
maybe
simply
stated
in
april
28,
1941,
the
petitioner
was
indicted
a
grand
jury
in
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
this
indictment
contained
three
counts.
all
charges
relating
to
the
national
motor
vehicle
theft
act.
first
count
charged
a
conspiracy
on
behalf
of
this
petitioner
and
his
two
codefendants
to
violate
that
statute.
second
count
charged
that
on
or
about
the
12th
day
of
february
1941,
petitioner
and
his
codefendants
did
unlawfully
and
feloniously
transport
and
caused
to
be
transported
in
interstate
commerce
from
atlanta
in
the
state
of
georgia
to
owen
county,
kentucky
when
1941
super
deluxe
ford
motor
car
identified
by
its
motor
number
which
have
theretofore
been
stolen
in
around
three
motor
companies
in
lake
city,
florida.
the
said
defendants
knowing
had
been
so
stolen.
the
third
count
charged
that
on
or
about
the
19th
day
of
january
1941
in
between
said
date
in
the
13th
day
of
february
1941,
and
then
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
the
petitioner
and
his
codefendants
did
unlawfully
and
feloniously
receive,
conceal,
and
store
the
same
motor
vehicle
as
to
which
the
transportation
was
charged
in
the
second
count,
knowing
that
it
was
moving
--
it
was
a
part
of
interstate
commerce
and
had
been
stolen
in
florida.
the
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
for
these
three
counts.
also
incidentally
on
april
28th
and
the
same
day,
the
judge
gave
sentences
of
two
years
on
count
1,
the
conspiracy
count
and
five
years
on
each
of
counts
2
and
3,
in
order
that
these
sentences
to
run
consecutively
for
a
total
of
12
years.
the
present
proceeding
began
with
the
motion
by
the
petitioner
to
vacate
the
sentence
under
count
3
and
motion
filed
under
28
united
states
code
2255
filed
on
april
9th,
1959.
this
motion
was
denied
by
the
district
court.
it
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
case
is
now
here.
as
a
result
of
a
combination
of
circumstances
which
don't
appear
on
the
record
of
this
case,
petitioner
is
now
serving
sentence
attributable
to
the
last
--
some
part
of
the
last
five
years,
so
there's
12-year
sentence
in
1941,
and
so
the
legality
of
the
sentence
under
the
--
is
--
is
presently
at
issue.
the
petitioner
and
the
government
are
in
agreement
that
the
motion
under
2255
was
a
proper
motion
to
raise
the
question,
whether
it
considering
the
phase
of
the
indictment,
the
consecutive
sentences
here
would
proper.
there's
also
an
agreement
that
the
issue
must
be
determined
from
the
phase
of
the
indictment
because
no
other
facts
are
numb.
the
question
then
becomes,
question
of
interpretation
of
the
statute,
the
national
motor
vehicle
theft
act
determined
whether
it
permitted
consecutive
sentences
were
fence
forting
and
for
receiving,
concealing,
and
storing
was
reference
to
the
same
automobile.
this
was
involved
here.
i
think
the
conflicting
positions
of
the
government
and
petitioner
can
be
quickly
set
out
and
would
show
the
dimensions
of
the
problem
before
us.
petitioner's
contention
is
essentially
this,
that
under
the
statute
properly
construed
a
single
defendant
may,
with
respect
to
a
single
automobile,
be
charged
with
only
one
offense.
that
is
that
during
a
period
of
time
here
the
statute
--
the
indictment
charged
that
between
january
19th
and
february
13th,
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
here
was
guilty
of
receiving,
concealing,
and
storing
an
automobile.
it
charged
that
on
february
12th
which
is
within
the
period
charged
in
receiving,
concealing,
and
storing
count
that
he
transported
this
automobile
in
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
broad
contention
then
of
the
petitioner
here,
if
it
would
not
regard
to
what
things
--
petitioner
may
have
done
with
this
automobile
without
regard
to
where
he
kept
it,
without
regard
to
whether
he
took
it
across
six
state
lines
or
one
state
line.
not
regard
to
whether
he
repainted
motor
numbers,
re-changed
the
motor
numbers,
repainted
the
car
whatever
else
he
did.
he
properly
construed
this
statute
under
this
statute
that
he
can
be
convicted
of
only
one
crime.
now,
the
governor's
con
--
the
government's
contention
is
set
forth
in
their
brief,
was
to
much
broader
contention
and
that
is,
as
i
understand
it
that
in
this
context,
a
person
may
be
charged
with
an
almost
indefinite
number
of
crimes
and
receive
consecutive
sentences
so
long
as
he
commits
separate
acts
with
reference
to
this
automobile.
and
the
government's
position
says
that
the
issue
turns
at
least
upon
the
question
of
whether
or
not
separate
acts
were
committed.
now,
two
examples
that
may
serve
to
illustrate
the
problem
that
we're
dealing
with,
one
example
would
be
the
case
of
the
professional
thief
which
steals
a
car
in
one
state,
immediately
transports
to
another
state
and
disposes
of
it
to
offense.
under
the
government's
contention,
the
state
would
be
chargeable
only
with
one
or
most
and
decision
of
the
government
says
it's
not
before
us,
because
it
isn't
two
crimes
and
it
could
get
most
of
10-year
sentence
under
this
circumstances.
now,
you
take
the
other
type
situation,
the
man
who
steals
the
car
in
order
to
use
it
instead
of
to
sell
it
and
he
manages
to
be
successful
until
elude
capture
for
a
period
of
time,
three
weeks,
three
months,
three
years.
and
during
this
period
of
time,
he
does
many
things
with
his
automobile.
he
stole
it
for
the
purpose
of
using
it.
he
may
have
transported
into
across
10
states.
he
may
have
repainted
it,
changed
the
licence
by
strange
motor
number.
it
did
many
things
for
his
automobile.
the
government's
contention
--
and
they
set
it
out
clearly
at
page
13
of
their
brief
seems
to
be
that
for
each
of
these
offenses
he
might
now
be
separately
punished.
the
example
i
gave
you
it
easily
see
a
sentence
of
100
years.
theoretically,
resulting
from
all
these
separate
acts
of
transporting
and
concealing
which
might
take
place
during
the
period
that
he
had
the
automobile.
so,
the
case
comes
to
issue
here,
because
on
the
face
of
the
indictment,
the
petitioner
can
only
show
that
he
was
charged
with
concealing
and
storing
over
a
period
of
time
an
automobile,
and
that
within
that
period
of
time,
he
was
charged
with
transporting
the
same
automobile.
now,
the
statute,
but
as
the
petitioner
goes
on
--
petitioner
is
further
pointed
that
the
statute
is
broad.
he
looked
at
the
statute
as
it
set
out.
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
statute
says
in
section
3,
"whoever
shall
transport
or
cause
to
be
transported
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
and
motor
vehicle
somewhere."
section
4,
whoever
shall
receive,
conceal,
store
or
barter
sell
or
dispose
of
any
motor
vehicle
moving
as
or
which
as
a
part
of
interstate
or
foreign
commerce
law.
now,
petitioner's
contention
is
that
this
statute
was
conceived
in
the
state
of
this
broadly.
in
order
that
the
government
could
prosecute
each
person
who
had
anything
to
do
with
this
stolen
car
knowing
that
it
had
been
stolen.
so
that
if
one
individual
repainted
the
--
re-changed
the
motor
number,
if
another
individual
received
it
and
sold
it,
if
the
third
individual
get
it,
if
--
if
you
had
a
series
of
individuals
dealing
with
this
automobile,
if
they
could
all
be
separately
punished
and
--
but
if
it
was
not
intended,
the
government
contends
here
that
when
one
individual
having
a
car
committed
these
separate
acts
then
he
could
so
be
punished
with
an
additional
five
years
sentence
possible
for
each
of
these
separate
acts.
now,
the
statute
on
its
phase
does
not
resolve
the
issue.
the
legislative
history
is
sparse
and
conceivably
could
be
ready
to
weigh,
each
petitioner
contends
there
is
no
legislative
history,
some
support
for
his
contention
that
congress
is
primarily
thinking
of
getting
at
different
persons,
instead
of
multiplying
offenses
against
to
single
person.
if
you
look
at
page
11
at
the
petitioner's
brief,
they
set
out
irrelevant
portions
of
the
house
committee
report
when
this
statute
was
presented
to
congress.
the
report
points
out,
that
state
laws
have
been
inadequate
to
meet
the
evil
because
of
the
interstate
movement
of
cars
making
it
difficult
for
the
states
to
apprehend
them.
and
then
it
says
in
about
the
fourth
sentence,
thieves
steal
automobiles
and
take
them
from
one
state
to
another
and
often
times
have
associates
in
the
crime
who
receive
and
sell
the
stolen
machines.
congress
there
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
different
persons.
the
same
thing
was
reiterated
when
congressman
dreier,
the
sponsor
of
the
legislation
spoken
the
floor
of
the
house,
statement
setout
at
the
bottom
of
page
12.
the
bill
provides
gentlemen
for
only
two
things,
section
3
provides
for
the
punishment
of
a
thief
stealing
a
car
and
transporting
it
from
one
state
to
another.
section
4
provides
for
the
receipt
of
the
stolen
car
by
thieves
in
another
state
for
the
purpose
of
selling
and
disposing
of
it.
again,
the
emphasis
seemed
to
be
on
the
two
person
category
the
thief
and
the
receiver
as
being
separate.
the
only
thing
in
the
senate
debate
seems
to
bare
on
the
issue
as
to
somewhat
ambiguous
statement
by
senator
cummins.
this
is
the
statement
which
the
petitioner
reads
one
way
and
the
governor
--
government
reads
another
way.
this
is
set
out
on
page
13.
senator
cummins
said,
"the
first
section
is
intended
to
punish
anyone
who
does
the
thing,
that
is
transporting
knowing
the
vehicle
have
been
stolen".
further
practice
is
it
possible
to
dispose
the
vehicle
to
some
other
party
to
--
or
otherwise
when
it
gets
across
the
state
line.
and
section
4
is
for
the
purpose
of
punishing
a
man
in
bars
herself
or
disposes
of
the
property
with
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
possession
thereof
or
if
he
conceals
it
knowing
it
to
have
been
stolen.
i
think
that
would
probably
embrace
every
case
that
could
be
reached.
petitioner's
contention
here
is
that
he
was
saying
only
that
he
is
possible
to
dispose
a
vehicle
to
some
other
party
and
then
section
4
is
for
punishing
a
man
that
is
the
other
party
who
have
been
gotten
the
car
bought
or
sells
or
disposes
of
the
property
with
intent
to
deprive
the
owner
of
the
possession,
and
not
that
he
was
mean
in
this
--
to
say
that
section
4
was
designed
to
punish
not
only
this
person,
but
also
to
impose
an
additional
person
on
the
transporter,
this
additional
punishment
on
the
transporter.
now,
this
isn't
much
in
the
way
of
substantial
legislative
history,
but
this
is
about
what
there
is
on
the
subject.
now,
given
this
posture,
petitioner
argues
this
is
certainly
inappropriate
case
for
applying
the
general
doctrine
of
statutory
instruction
--
construction
which
has
been
known
as
the
rule
of
lenity
which
has
been
set
forth
by
this
court
in
a
series
of
cases.
and
while
each
of
these
cases
have
involved
particular
factual
situations
and
particular
statutes,
in
each
of
then
the
rule
has
been
stated
broadly
in
the
cit
credit
corporation
case.
this
court
said
when
a
choice
that
has
to
be
made
between
two
readings
of
what
conduct
congress
has
made
a
crime.
it
is
appropriate
before
we
choose
the
harsh
role
alternative
to
require
that
congress
should
have
spoken
any
language
that
is
clear
and
definite.
we
should
not
derive
criminal
outlawry
from
some
ambiguous
implication.
in
bell,
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
there
are
presumptive
position
of
our
law
to
result
doubts
and
the
enforcement
of
a
penal
code
against
the
imposition
of
a
hardship
punishment.
prince
reference
is
made
to
the
policy
of
not
attributing
to
congress
in
the
enactment
of
criminal
statutes
and
an
intention
to
punish
more
severely
from
the
language
of
its
laws
clearly
in
courts,
and
so
on.
it
seems
the
petitioner,
this
is
an
appropriate
case.
and
to
have
here
--
first,
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
we
have
here
a
situation
for
the
federal
government
interest,
its
basically
an
interest
is
assisting
the
state
to
law
enforcement.
this
statute
has
passed,
as
said
in
the
legislative
history
because
the
states
were
not
able
to
cope
with
the
problem
of
stolen
automobiles
knowing
in
the
interstate
commerce.
it's
relevant
here
then
i
think
to
note
that
generally
speaking,
in
the
law
of
law
of
larceny
which
is
the
law,
the
states
would
be
applying
the
stolen
cars.
generally
speaking
in
the
law
of
larceny,
legislatures
in
the
common
law
have
not
carved
up
a
crime
that
a
man
steals
something,
he
steals
it
for
what
purpose,
to
use
it,
to
sell
it,
to
dispose
evidence
(inaudible).
and
these
things
have
all
been
regarded
as
part
of
a
single
crime,
and
generally,
unless
you
have
specific
statute,
specifically
setting
them
up.
the
law
has
not
dealt
with
the
thief
by
saying,
"we'll
impose
one
punishment
on
you
for
stealing
the
article,
a
separate
punishment
on
you
for
keeping
it,
and
maybe
a
third
punishment,
because
you
now
sold
it
to
somebody
else."
now,
since
this
statute
was
enacted
against
this
general
background
of
the
law
of
larceny,
it
would
seem
that
congress
was
not
here
trying
to
say
that
each
of
these
acts
that
the
government
talks
about
is
to
be
regarded
in
such
a
criminal
offense
that
a
man
may
potentially
be
given
an
additional
five-year
sentence
for
each
of
them.
but
every
time
he
takes
the
car
across
another
state
line
that
every
time
he
conceals
the
car
in
a
garage
so
the
police
will
not
find
it,
that
every
time
he
repaints
it,
that
every
time
he
changes
the
motor
number,
that
each
of
this
succession
of
acts,
all
of
which
are
properly
incident
and
really
a
part
of
the
basic
concept
here
that
these
should
each
be
regarded
as
separate
criminal
acts
for
which
he
could
receive
an
additional
punishment
of
five
years,
since
the
petitioner
highly
doubtful
what
congress
intended
such
a
harsh
result.
the
emphasis
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
legislative
history
is
upon
the
type
situation
of
the
professional
thief,
who
steals
occur
in
one
state
and
quickly
disposes
of
it
in
another
state.
and
under
the
argument
put
forth
by
the
government,
he
would
receive
the
least
punishment,
the
man
who
stole
the
car
to
use
it,
the
joyrider
and
they've
been
joyrider
problems
under
this
statute.
the
serviceman
who
steals
the
car
to
get
home
who,
in
the
process
of
using
the
car,
goes
through
several
states
who
--
who
may
do
a
number
of
acts
with
respect
to
that
automobile.
he's
the
one
which
under
this
interpretation
the
statute
would
permit
a
pyramiding
of
consecutive
punishments.
now,
this
punishment
--
obviously
the
--
this
is
all
subject
to
the
discretion
of
the
prosecution
and
would
have
been
charged
for
discretion
of
the
court
as
to
what
it
was
sentence.
but
petitioner's
petition
for
--
position
that
there
seems
to
be
no
useful
purpose
served
by
so
construing
this
statute
in
the
absence
of
explicit
congressional
--
explicit
congressional
spelling
out
to
permit
that
kind
of
nullification
punishment.
it
seems
to
bare
no
reasonable
relationship
to
what
congress
was
getting
at.
it
would
not
seem
that
criminality
multiplies
as
a
factor
of
time
which
would
seem
to
be
the
result
of
the
peti
--
of
the
position
taken
by
the
government,
and
it
would
seem
that
a
proper
construction
here
would
be
a
construction
contended
for
by
the
petitioner
which
would
permit
the
imposition
of
a
substantial
punishment
of
five
years
in
the
federal
penitentiary
upon
any
person
who
commits
any
of
these
prescribed
acts
with
reference
to
a
stolen
automobile
which
is
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
but
--
and
further,
that
it
would
permit
the
government
to
secure
a
conviction
by
charging
and
proving
anyone
acting
a
change,
so
that
the
government's
convenience
in
selecting
the
--
the
act
permitted
by
the
counsel
would
be
served.
this
would
be
enough
to
carry
out
the
general
policy
of
the
congress,
without
making
possible
harsh
imposition
of
multiple
punishments
on
persons
who
steal
cars
or
involved
with
interstate
transportation
of
motor
vehicles.
now,
essentially,
this
then
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
to
start
with
the
fact
that
they
have
no
notion
what
the
actual
facts
in
this
case
are,
start
with
the
fact
that
since
we
are
dealing
with
a
plea
of
guilty
to
an
indictment,
we
only
know
that
he
is
charged
and
received
consecutive
sentences
for
(a)
transporting
and
(b)
receiving
and
concealing
the
same
automobile
within
the
same
general
period
of
time.
and
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
this
statute
should
be
so
construed
in
cases
of
this
kind,
only
one
punishment
upon
one
person
with
respect
to
one
automobile
that
has
been
transported
and
held
in
interstate
commerce
as
a
part
of
a
single
continuos
transaction.
of
course,
i'm
not
taking
the
position
that
if
he
deals
the
car
today
and
it's
later
taken
back
and
then
six
months
later,
he
steals
the
same
car
and
this
is
--
wouldn't
constitute
or
transports.
it
wouldn't
constitute
separate
crimes
that
were
you
have
charged
a
continuous
period
of
possession
that
within
that
continuous
period
of
possession,
there
should
be
only
one
crime
and
therefore
only
one
sentence
under
the
statute.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
may
have
five
more
minutes,
your
honor.
just
really
two
additional
points,
we've
discussed
the
construction
of
the
indictment.
petitioner's
position
i
think,
differs
in
the
government's
only
into
this.
petitioner
would
say
that
the
indictment
charges
that
in
the
third
count.
the
petitioner's
codefendants
received,
concealed
and
stored
the
automobile
between
the
19th
day
of
january
and
the
13th
day
of
february.
second
count
charged
that
they
transported
it
on
the
12th
day
of
february.
therefore,
the
petitioner
thinks
that
it's
fair
to
assume
from
this
indictment
that
petitioner
and
his
codefendants
had
possession
of
the
car
from
whatever
point
at
which
they
received
it
to
and
including
the
period
of
transportation,
because
the
transportation
and
his
charge
is
in
the
middle
of
the
period
in
which
he
was
charged
that
they
received
concealment
stored.
so
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
if
you
disregard
allegations
of
time
your
honor,
then
you
could
read
this
indictment
of
saying
that
the
transportation
was
on
the
12th
and
their
concealment
was
on
the13th.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that
--
that
they're
tied
together
here
and
perhaps
the
only
sentence
that
--
that's
relevant
i
think,
but
generally
the
course
of
conduct
here,
a
general
period
of
time,
both
defenses
related
to
an
automobile.
i
suspect
that
in
dealing
with
this
problem
perhaps,
the
court
is
as
well
off
to
have
no
other
facts
than
it
has
because
i'm
not
sure
there's
any
stocking
place,
between
saying,
this
statute
meant
to
get
that
separate
persons
who
were
involved
in
varying
ways
with
respect
to
a
stolen
car
and
saying
on
the
other
extreme,
that
criminality
here
becomes
a
factor
of
time
and
distance.
and
that
the
more
time
that
elapses,
the
more
things
that
a
person
does
with
the
car,
the
more
possible
counts
that
may
be
charged
against
him.
and
i
suggest
here
that
generally
and
this
is
a
special
kind
of
statute,
generally,
we
don't
calculate
criminality
in
that
way.
certainly
in
the
field
of
larceny
generally,
the
man's
punishment
doesn't
rise
with
the
length
of
time
that
we
hold
on
to
the
stolen
--
or
stolen
article,
or
with
the
number
of
things
he
does
with
the
stolen
article
before
the
time
in
which
he's
caught.
these
were
all
regarded
as
part
and
--
of
the
necessary
incidence
of
effect.
now
true,
we're
not
dealing
with
a
larceny
statute
here.
we're
not
dealing
with
the
larceny
statute
only
because
congress
didn't
have
the
constitutional
authority
to
make
a
larceny
statute,
so
they
made
it
to
transportation
statute
and
tied
it
in
here,
really
assisting
the
states
in
the
enforcement
of
their
own
law
here
not
any
separate
federal
interest
basically
beyond
that,
assisting
the
states
in
enforcing
their
larceny
law.
we
accept
the
government's
contention,
the
man
who
steals
the
car
and
keeps
it
within
the
state
where
he
steals
it,
probably
will
get
under
most
state
laws
the
time
whereof
one
charge,
one
sentence
or
whatever
the
local
sentences
for
larceny
of
automobiles.
no
matter
how
long
it
keeps
it,
no
matter
what
he
does
with
it
or
how
many
crimes
he
commits,
committed
or
what.
this
was
an
incident,
but
here
once
he
go
across
the
state
line,
the
government's
argument
now
and
they
make
it
quite
clearly
certainly
on
page
13
of
their
brief
that
the
longer
he
keeps
the
car,
the
more
things
he
does
with
it,
the
more
places
he
drives
it
and
so
on,
the
more
crimes,
potential
crimes
he's
creating.
all
i
suggest
is
doubtful
that
congress
intended
to
give
to
courts
the
discretion
to
impose
what
could
be
an
obviously
enormously
large
sentences
for
this
offense,
under
--
under
this
situation.
and
beyond
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
prior
cases,
i
suggest
that
the
government's
construction
here
is
somewhat
narrow,
that
the
rule
of
lenity
as
i
read
it,
as
this
court
has
adopted
it,
is
a
part
of
the
general
rule
with
statutory
construction.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
within
the
general
statements,
your
honor
that
petitioner's
position
that
the
general
statement
certainly
is
not
confined
as
the
government
suggests
to
whether
you
have
separate
acts
or
don't
have
separate
acts.
it's
a
general
proposition
which
petitioner
argues,
should
apply
here.
the
statute
is
not
clear.
it
can
reasonably
be
read
as
the
saying,
we're
going
to
reach
different
people
and
not
multiply
offenses
to
one
individual.
there
are
potentialities
of
harsh
punishments
being
imposed
if
you
read
the
statute,
as
the
government
reads
it.
it
seems
to
me
here,
the
conditions
are
satisfied
for
the
applying
of
this
general
notion
statutory
construction.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
if
now,
i
--
i'd
say,
you
have
to
qualify
this
that
if
--
if
the
automobile
was
stolen
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
and
recovered
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
--
and
then
a
year
later,
it's
re-stolen,
this
is
different.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
but
--
but
from
time
from
which
the
car
is
stolen
until
which
somebody
is
apprehended,
that
one
defendant
under
my
construction
shall
only
commit
one
crime
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well,
under
my
contention
is
we
have
to
regard
it
--
we
really
should
regard
it
as
one
offense.
i
think
this
is
basically
the
trouble
we
get
into
here,
is
because
congress
was
dealing
with
the
situation
where
they
had
constitutional
limitations.
they
couldn't
start
out
by
saying,
"we're
going
to
punish
you
for
larceny.
we're
going
to
punish
it
for
receiving
stolen
property."
so
you
punished
transporting
and
then
you
--
you
get
into
--
and
then
you
punish
receiving
and
stealing
and
you
read
the
--
to
what
you
can
get
out
of
the
congressional
history,
they're
thinking
of
different
people.
now,
if
the
man
receives
the
car
from
this
person
who
stole
it
in
another
state
and
then
he
subsequently
transports
it.
i
still
don't
see
any
reason
for
interpreting
the
statute
as
to
say,
"well,
he
should
be
charged
with
the
receiving
and
in
the
subsequent
transporting."
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
i
just
going
to
add
one
thing,
it
seems
to
me
here,
particularly
difficult
and
more
so
than
the
other
statue
you've
dealt
with,
to
draw
any
line
other
than
the
quite
broad
line
here,
because
unlike
an
ordinary
theft
case
such
as
you
have
in
the
heflin
case
that
the
number
of
--
of
offense
of
separate
acts
they're
going
to
occur
for
somebody
who
stole
something
from
a
bank.
it
will
be
going
to
relatively
small
normally,
but
in
the
automobile
case
and
normal
concomitant
into
the
theft
of
the
car,
is
going
to
be
many
--
often,
would
be
many
act
of
transportation,
many
acts
of
concealment,
because
this
is
what
you
do.
you
steal
the
car
to
use
it
or
to
sell
it,
to
take
it
somewhere
to
dispose
of
it
and
this
adds
up
the
possibility
of
creating
many
separate
offenses
in
the
ordinary
transaction.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
well
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
my
argument
is
slightly
different
i
think
when
you
suggest.
all
i'm
arguing
is
that
since
here,
congress
was
--
was
passing
this
law
an
aid
of
the
states,
because
they
couldn't
cope
with
the
stolen
car
problem.
it's
reasonable
and
to
read
the
statute,
so
that
you
don't
impose
much
harsher
consequences
on
the
man
who
transports
the
car
across
the
state
line,
than
he
would
ever
receive,
if
he
did
all
the
same
acts
with
reference
to
the
same
car
within
a
state
and
in
this
sense,
--
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
this
goes
to
(voice
overlap)
construction,
here.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
this
really
all
--
i
think
all
comes
down
your
honor,
to
the
simple
question
here,
whether
you
read
the
congressional
history
as
an
intention
merely
to
reach
all
the
separate
persons,
could
get
and
have
connection
with
this
car
as
it
moves
along
or
whether
you
read
it
to
improve
just
to
--
multiple
offenses
to
the
single
individual.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
yes.
[laughs]
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
barrett,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
