chief

well,
i
know
but
don't
you
know
the
facts
--
don't
you
know
the
facts
as
to
the
dates
of
this
--
when
--
when
he
stole
the
automobile,
when
he
transport
it
--

or

mr.
terris,
you
may
continue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
same
automobile
that
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
involved
in
the
other
two
counts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
terris,
where
would
your
reasoning
lead
us
in
the
case
where
two
persons
agreed
one
day
to
transport
a
stolen
car
across
state
lines
and
the
following
day,
they
proceeded
to
do
that
and
then
having
cross
the
state
line,
they
put
the
car
in
a
garage
overnight
and
to
say,
they
conceal
it
from
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
next
morning,
they
were
arrested.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
would
maybe
a
more
difficult,
but
where
would
your
--
your
reasoning
lead
us
to
in
the
case
of
that
crime,
would
there
be
three
crimes
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
you
think
there
would
be
three
crimes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.

and

chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
this
so
much
different
that
was
--
that
was
--
it
would
be
a
break
in
that
case,
they
--
they
put
the
car
in
the
garage
in
the
state
overnight
and
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
will
rest
again.
