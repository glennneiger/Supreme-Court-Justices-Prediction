justice
hugo
l.

was
there
any
evidence
offered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
then
by
saying,
he
failed
to
sustain
his
burden
of
proof?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
has
been
opened
to
him
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
where
he
challenged
the
judgment
as
being
invalid
and
he
offered
evidence
to
prove
what
it
seems
to
be
rather
studiously
kept
away
from
us,
what
actually
happened
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they're
possible
of
ascertainment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
as
to
who
stole
this
automobile?
whether
he
stole
it
and
what
part
he
had
to
do
with
it.
i'd
suppose
that
could've
been
ascertained
in
the
hearing
before
the
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't'
know
that
could
be
done.
but
i'm
just
asking
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
found
it,
then
you'll
own
the
automobile,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
down
in
florida.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
question
of
whether
they've
been
charges,
more
charges
made
against
him
and
should
have
been
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
could,
that
evidence
would
reveal
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
asking
on
the
assumption
of
possibility
that
the
government
might
be
wrong
on
that
and
then
in
habeas
corpus,
you
had
the
right
to
go
to
the
very
roots
of
the
thing,
finding
out
what
actually
happened.
justice
hugo
l.
black
perhaps,
that
wouldn't
be
contrary,
wouldn't
it?
it
would
just
be
showing
what
actually
happened.
