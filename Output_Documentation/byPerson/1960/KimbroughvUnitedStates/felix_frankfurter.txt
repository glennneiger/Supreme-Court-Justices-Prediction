an
allegation
at
the
time
on
important
in
an
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
you
just
--
if
you
could
read
it
giving
some
other
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
this
--
has
this
court
in
any
case,
ever
said
there
is
a
rule
of
lenity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
it
ever
said
there
was
--
there
was
a
rule
of
lenity?
it
has
said
something
very
different.
it's
said
that
when
we
are
doubtful,
we
reject
the
harsh
of
punishment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
a
very
different
thing
than
to
have
a
positive,
affirmative
governing
rule
that
you
apply
--
that
you
read
statute,
with
some
notion
of
lenity
in
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
started
out
with,
what
to
me
was
a
very
engaging
general
consideration
and
just
ended
it
up
--
ended
up
with
it,
a
minute
ago.
namely
and
it
--
and
i
think
very
engaging
and
--
and
far
reaching,
namely
that
we're
dealing
here
with
the
crime
made
so
by
congress,
not
under
its
extraordinary
penal
cars,
but
as
an
adjunct
and
as
a
help
to
state
prosecution
because
it's
assumed
with
the
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
very
well
that
the
large
number,
the
bulk
of
penal
legislation
federally
enforced
it
derived
from
the
commerce
clause
and
if
you're
--
if
you're
--
generally,
all
you
have
to
see
where
this
case.
i'm
quite
aware
of
it,
but
since
you
invoked
the
general
principle,
i
want
to
consider
it
that
this
is
all
and
you
said
a
minute
ago,
you
start
out
which
i
get.
this
is
all
in
aid
of
state,
what
is
really
local
--
what
is
really
local,
what
a
local
misconduct.
well,
when
you
think
of
how
much
there
is
on
the
--
on
the
--
in
the
code
in
18
u.s.c.
and
has
been
for
the
last
one,
ever
since
the
champion
to
way
back
the
lottery
cases
are,
in
which
congress
has
made
crimes
hanging
them
on
--
pegging
--
to
peg
on
which
they
hung
the
power
in
the
commerce
clause,
but
i
don't
see
that
that
should
lead
us
in
all
those
cases
to
say,
"oh,
since
this
as
it
were,
an
auxiliary
power,
we
must
looks
up
and
confine
the
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
that's
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
think,
at
least
i
don't.
i
don't
think,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
conceive
what
you
said.
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
just
there
that
i
--
that
i
--
i'd
rather
distortedly,
because
congress
--
the
purpose
is
congress
said,
"we
don't
want
to
cut
her
up
interstate
commerce
and
make
these
national
auxiliary
then
submit
for
crime.
and
therefore,
i
don't
find
any
--
i
can't
impliedly
find
any
restricted
way
of
looking
at
the
statutes.
if
it
has
in
fact,
not
only
make
the
direct
transportation
or
direct
use
of
the
mail,
direct
crossing
state
line
an
offense
and
also
said
we're
going
to
go
out
after
all
the
--
all
that
is
related
to
the
power
that
we
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
as
you
read
it,
not
shedding
in
the
light
on
it
at
all.
