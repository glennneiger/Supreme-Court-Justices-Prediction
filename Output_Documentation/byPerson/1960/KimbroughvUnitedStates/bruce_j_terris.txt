mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
in
his
brief
characterized
the
facts
which
were
before
the
court
has
involving
the
general
course
of
conduct,
and
that
both
the
acts
of
concealment
and
the
acts
of
transportation
which
were
involved
--
which
were
charged
in
the
indictment
concerned
were
within
this
general
course
of
conduct.
here,
it
--
it
seems
that
he
agrees
with
the
position
that
i
was
going
to
take
that
from
this
indictment,
we
cannot
assume
that
the
general
course
of
conduct
was
involved.
instead
here,
he
--
he
seems
to
say
that
one
automobile,
one
offense
even
if
these
acts
are
totally
separate
both
in
--
not
only
in
time
but
also
in
criminal
impulse
and
in
the
purpose
for
which
the
acts
were
committed.
now,
we
will
prepare
to
argue
that
even
assuming
that
there
was
a
general
course
of
conduct
that
the
rule
of
lenity
which
was
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
bell
case,
in
the
hampel
case,
and
the
other
cases
that
this
rule
did
not
apply
to
acts
that
were
totally
separated
in
time.
and
--
and
so
why
they're
separated
in
time
and
so
--
and
so
not
in
--
intimately
related,
so
that
they
were
merely
part
of
the
general
course
of
conduct.
we
thought
that
rule
of
lenity
would
not
apply
even
to
that
situation.
but
of
course,
we
feel
that
even
more
so
does
the
rule
of
lenity
not
apply
to
a
situation
in
which
the
acts
are
totally
separate,
they
do
not
involve
a
general
course
of
conduct,
and
they
must
be
assumed
to
be
totally
separate
in
criminal
impulse
and
in
purpose.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
only
facts
that
we
have
before
us
your
honor
is
the
indictment,
because
petitioner
pleaded
guilty,
i
might
say
with
the
advise
of
counsel,
and
honest
plea
of
guilty,
he
admitted
his
separate
guilt
to
these
two
separate
counts
which
are
before
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
there's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
nothing
in
the
indictment
to
suggest
that
he
did
steal
the
automobile
and
that
of
course
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
is
not
part
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
only
--
the
only
place
farther
it
went
is
that
there
was
immediately
on
the
same
date
of
a
plea
of
guilty.
i
might
say
that
the
government's
investigation
to
the
facts
was
cut
short
because
they
were
going
to
indict
him
at
a
later
term.
and
he
--
and
he
as
well
as
two
codefendants
pleaded
guilty,
said
that
he
wanted
to
plead
guilty
and
that
therefore
he
was
indicted
in
an
earlier
term.
the
--
the
facts
as
--
as
the
government
knows
are
--
are
therefore
very
incomplete
in
addition
all
of
that
i've
been
able
to
see
is
fbi
report
says
early
stages
of
the
investigation.
they
indicated
many
leads
and
not
yet
been
followed
up.
therefore,
we
--
we
don't
think
that
that
--
the
actual
facts
can
be
interpreted
as
any
different
from
what
the
indictment
specifically
alleges.
now,
i
assume
the
petitioner
must
have
thought
the
facts
in
the
indictment
were
accurate,
or
he
and
his
counsel
wouldn't
have
--
wouldn't
have
agreed
that
he
plead
guilty.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
is
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
now,
turning
to
the
indictment,
which
are
the
only
facts
before
the
court
in
which
the
petitioner
agrees
he
--
as
he
stated
here
today
are
the
only
facts
before
the
court.
we
believe
that
the
indictment
strongly
suggest
on
its
phase
that
these
acts
are
totally
separate
in
every
way,
the
concealment
and
the
transportation.
the
indictment
is
on
pages
2
to
4
of
the
record.
count
3
of
the
indictment,
which
is
the
concealment
count,
alleges
that
the
ford
automobile
was
stolen
on
january
19th
in
lake
city,
florida.
it
also
alleges
that
it
was
transported
on
or
about
january
19th
to
kentucky.
it
further
alleges
that
on
--
that
starting
on
or
about
january
19th
and
lasting
to
february
13th
on
1941,
petitioner
and
his
two
codefendants
received,
concealed,
and
stored
the
automobile
in
the
eastern
district
of
kentucky.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
recess
yesterday,
we
were
discussing
the
government's
contention
that
concealment
and
the
transportation
involved
in
this
case,
were
completely
unrelated
except
to
the
fact
that
the
same
automobile
and
the
same
persons
were
involved.
apparently,
petitioner
accepts
this
characterization
of
the
facts
since
yesterday,
you'd
not
argue
the
position
of
his
brief
if
one
general
course
of
conduct
was
involved
but
instead
he
maintained
the
considerably
more
extreme
position
that
one
automobile
means
one
offense
no
matter
how
unrelated
the
acts
concerning
this
automobile
may
be.
now,
turning
to
the
indictment
which
is
on
pages
2
to
4
of
the
record,
count
3
of
the
indictment
which
is
the
concealment
count,
alleges
that
at
particular
ford
automobile
was
stolen
in
lake
city,
florida
on
january
19th,
1941.
it
further
alleges
that
between
january
19th
and
february
13th,
1941,
petitioner
and
his
two
codefendants
received,
concealed
and
stored
the
same
automobile
in
kentucky.
and
it
further
alleges
that
the
automobile
at
that
time
of
the
concealment
was
then
and
their
moving
as
was
a
part
of
and
constituted
interstate
commerce
from
lake
city
in
the
state
of
florida
to
owen
county
near
frankfort,
kentucky.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
the
same
automobile
was
involved
in
all
three
of
the
counts.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
concealment
was
after
the
stealing.
we
have
--
we
have
no
knowledge
that
petitioner
or
his
two
codefendants
participated
in
the
stealing,
that's
not
shown
in
the
indictment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
19th.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
was
transported
to
kentucky
by
somebody
else.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
now,
of
course
we
seek
concealment
and
storage
of
the
stolen
automobile
was
only
a
federal
offense,
when
the
automobile
is
moving
in
an
interstate
commerce.
now,
count
3
specifically
bases
its
allegation
of
receipt,
concealment
and
storage
of
the
automobile
from
florida
to
kentucky,
not
the
subsequent
transportation
which
is
involved
in
count
2.
therefore,
the
acts
of
concealment
which
are
alleged
in
count
3
are
specifically
tied
to
the
earlier
transportation
on
january
19th.
now,
count
2
of
the
indictment,
which
is
a
transportation
count,
alleges
the
petitioner
and
his
two
codefendants
transported
the
same
ford
automobile
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
this
is
the
second
count.
the
first
count
is
the
conspiracy
count
and
that
isn't
involved
here
at
all,
your
honor.
count
2
alleges
that
petitioner's
two
codefendants
transported
the
same
automobile
on
february
12th
from
atlanta,
georgia
to
kentucky.
now,
since
on
or
about
january
19th,
the
automobile
was
in
kentucky
and
since
he
moved
from
georgia
to
kentucky
on
february
12th,
it
is
clear
that
sometime
between
january
19th
and
february
12th,
the
car
was
moved
from
kentucky
to
georgia.
now,
whether
it
was
by
--
moved
by
petitioner
or
by
someone
else,
is
again
not
clear
from
the
indictment.
so
--
so
that
for
all
the
indictment
shows,
the
possession
of
the
car
may
not
have
even
been
in
continuous
possession
of
petitioner
or
his
two
codefendants.
therefore,
the
--
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
acts
of
concealment
alleged
in
count
3,
were
not
only
in
tied
in
the
indictment
to
a
transportation
which
was
not
alleged
as
an
offense
in
the
indictment,
but
an
additional
transportation,
which
was
not
alleged
as
an
offense
in
the
indictment,
occurred
between
the
acts
of
concealment,
the
beginning
of
the
acts
of
concealment
and
the
transportation
which
was
charged.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there
is
--
there
was
no
transportation
from
florida
to
georgia,
unless
that
was
the
route
that
was
from
florida
to
kentucky.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
and
assuming
the
petitioner
was
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
was
the
--
person
who
did
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
the
transporting.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
quite
clear
on
the
facts
you're
posing
to
me,
your
honor.
if
you're
--
if
you're
suggesting
a
continuous
transportation
from
florida
to
kentucky,
whether
we
can
charge
an
offense
for
the
transportation
from
florida
to
georgia,
then
from
georgia
to
tennessee
and
then
from
tennessee
to
kentucky,
that
--
that
involves
a
much
more
difficult
issue
and
as
far
as
i've
been
able
to
see,
the
government
has
never
made
that
kind
of
an
allegation
in
any
of
the
cases
which
have
been
reported.
they've
always
alleged
the
entire
transportation
then
mentioned
the
intermediate
states
in
the
indictment.
now,
insofar
as
your
--
whether
you're
suggesting
that
there
was
a
--
a
whether
we
--
if
petitioner
had
brought
the
cars
from
florida
to
kentucky,
we
could
allege
that
entire
transportation
plus
the
transportation
from
georgia
to
kentucky,
which
was
made
three
and
a
half
weeks
later.
that
again
is
a
--
is
a
different
issue
and
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
too
separated
from
the
--
from
the
facts
of
this
case.
if
we
assume
those
are
entirely
unrelated
transportations,
in
the
sense
that
they
may
well
have
been
done
for
entirely
different
purposes.
in
short,
as
we
read
the
indictment,
the
facts
of
this
case
so
that
the
acts
of
concealment
and
the
acts
of
transportation
which
were
alleged,
were
separate
and
entirely
unrelated.
this
is
suggested
very
strongly
in
the
indictment,
but
this
is
especially
true,
since
we
believe
that
under
well-established
rules
of
law,
this
indictment
must
be
construed
in
the
way
which
is
most
favorable
for
the
government.
it's,
of
course,
a
familiar
principle
that
a
final
judgment
is
presumed
to
be
correct
and
that
the
burden
is
on
the
person
attacking
that
judgment
to
show
the
facts
supporting
his
claim.
now,
your
petitioner
pleaded
guilty
and
thereby
removed
the
necessity
for
the
government
to
prove
the
facts
underlying
the
indictment
and
he
admitted
his
separate
guilt
on
the
two
separate
counts.
and
at
the
same
time,
he
made
the
indictment,
the
sole
relevant
fact
when
he
made
this
collateral
attack,
18
years
later.
therefore,
we
believe
that
insofar
as
the
indictment
is
ambiguous,
petitioner
has
failed
to
sustain
his
burden
of
proof.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
was
--
he
was
represented
by
a
counsel.
that
--
that
appears
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
any
evidence
offered?
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
evidence
was
offered
as
far
as
we
know,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
since
he
pleaded
guilty,
the
sole
relevant
document
before
--
for
this
court
and
before
the
two
lower
courts
on
this
motion,
was
the
indictment.
and
therefore,
insofar
as
the
indictment
is
ambiguous,
that
he
--
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
that
is
his
fault
and
not
--
and
not
the
government's.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
first
of
all
your
honor,
not
attempting
to
keep
the
facts
--
the
facts
away
because
we
don't
know
what
the
facts
are.
we
have
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
i
--
that
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
that's
right,
i
--
i
don't
very
much
at
the
present
time,
whether
the
facts
in
the
--
in
the
sense
of
something
that
one
could
--
could
prove
could
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
don't
get
very
much,
your
honor.
he
didn't
make
his
motion
until
1959,
judging
from
what
--
our
file
show,
that
guy
was
having
a
very
difficult
time
finding
the
facts
of
this
case,
back
in
1941.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
know
--
yes,
your
honor
that's
the
alleged
in
the
indictment,
who
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
and
--
and
of
course,
they
could
prove
that
it
would
--
that
it
was
stolen.
and
--
then
perhaps,
they
could
still
prove
that
today.
but
that
and
even
the
proof
of
the
--
of
course
the
stealing,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
help
us
to
decide
this
case.
the
stealing
is
not
part
of
the
allegation
in
any
fashion.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
--
there
is
indeed
that
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
--
the
evidence
would
reveal
that
if
the
evidence
was
--
was
still
available.
of
course,
the
government's
primary
contention
in
--
in
that
regard,
is
that
on
--
that
on
collateral
attack,
a
person
is
not
entitled
to
re-litigate,
when
he's
pleaded
guilty.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
think
that
you've
never
been
entitled
in
habeas
corpus
to
attack
the
judgment
in
this
type
of
situation,
where
a
person
has
pleaded
guilty
and
then
wants
to
establish
the
facts
contrary
to
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
to
--
it
might
turnout
not
to
be
contrary.
it
might
only
be
an
explanation
within
the
face
of
the
indictment
or
it
may
--
might
turnout
to
be
contrary
either
--
either
way.
we
don't
think
it
--
he
was
entitled
under
habeas
corpus.
there's
no
entitled
on
collateral
attack
to
--
to
re-litigate
that
issue.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
it
that
was
in
1941,
it
was
done.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
if
it's
a
--
it's
fairly
--
it's
fairly
complicated
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
is
in
prison.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
under
one
of
these
sentences.
he
--
he
got
a
conditional
release
and
he
violated
the
conditional
release
and
therefore,
he's
now
back
serving
the
remainder
of
the
--
of
the
sentence,
which
he
had
not
completed.
construing
the
indictment
most
favorably
for
the
government,
we
can
properly
assume
a
state
of
facts,
which
the
concealment
and
the
transportation
were
entirely
separate.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
borrowing
time
off
for
good
behavior,
he
has
--
he
has
until
early
in
1965.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
to
be
more
specific,
he
--
at
the
time
that
he
was
given
this
12-year
sentence,
he
was
given
an
additional
five-year
sentence,
for
attempted
escape
while
he
was
in
jail
on
--
on
this
offense.
so
he
had
a
17-year
sentence
to
dissatisfy.
he
was
given
a
conditional
release
in
1951.
in
1955,
he
was
picked
up
again
under
the
direct,
under
the
same
statute
and
convicted.
he
served
that
sentence
first
and
now,
he
is
back
serving
the
--
the
sentence
which
is
involved
here
and
that
would
last
about
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
apparently,
he's
not
serving
that
sentence
or
any
portion
of
that
sentence
at
the
moment.
stating
the
--
the
facts
of
the
case
more
concretely,
we
feel
we
can
assume
consistent
with
the
indictment.
and
on
january
19th,
petitioner
and
his
codefendants,
either
themselves
transported
the
automobile
from
florida
or
received
it
in
kentucky
from
persons
who
did
transport
it.
that
on
that
some
--
same
day
or
shortly
thereafter,
petitioner
and
his
codefendants
engaged
in
acts
of
concealing
the
automobile,
such
as
changing
the
motor
numbers
or
repainting
the
car
or
similar
such
acts,
which
have
been
held
in
other
cases
to
constitute
acts
of
concealment
under
the
statute.
and
sometime
later,
perhaps
some
three
weeks,
either
petitioner
and
his
codefendants
or
someone
else,
transported
this
automobile
from
kentucky
to
georgia.
and
we
can
--
and
we
can
properly
assume
that
the
purpose
of
the
return
trip
from
which
petitioner
and
his
codefendants
transported
the
automobile
from
georgia
to
kentucky,
was
not
for
the
same
purpose
as
the
original
concealment.
for
example,
it
may
have
been
to
go
visit
friends,
go
on
legitimate
business
or
even
they
commit
another
crime.
if
this
case
is
considered
on
these
facts,
which
we
emphasized
that
it
must
be,
we
feel
that
there
is
--
there
were
clearly
two
separate
offenses
which
are
separately
punishable
under
the
statute.
we
feel
that
it's
clear
that
if
a
person
transports
the
same
automobile
across
state
lines
and
then
three
and
a
half
weeks
later,
an
entirely
different
criminal
impulsive
for
a
different
purpose,
he
repeats
the
same
act
that
there
would
clearly
be
two
separate
violations
of
section
3
of
the
statute.
we
can
see
no
difference
when
the
person
commits
acts
of
concealment,
violating
section
4
of
the
act.
and
then
three
and
a
half
weeks
later,
for
an
entirely
different
purpose
and
entirely
different
criminal
impulse,
he
violates
section
3
by
transporting
the
automobile
across
state
lines.
now,
we
think
that
the
rule
of
lenity
clearly
does
not
apply
in
this
situation
then
none
of
the
case
is
decided
by
this
court
composed
to
even
suggesting
that
there
--
there
is
only
offense
involved
here
or
might
to
delay
discussion
of
the
cases
applying
the
rule
until
after
he
discussed
petitioner's
contention,
which
he
makes
in
his
brief
and
the
general
course
of
conduct
is
involved.
since
as
we've
persist,
i
hope
to
show
that
the
rule
of
lenity
would
not
apply
even
if
the
general
course
of
conduct
were
involved
and
for
sure,
it
would
not
apply
if
the
acts
were
entirely
separate
and
unrelated.
assuming
the
petitioner
is
correct
and
then
the
general
course
of
conduct
were
involved,
i
--
i
take
it
that
this
would
mean
that
there
is
a
single
general
course
of
conduct
relating
to
the
same
automobile
from
january
19th
to
february
13th,
and
this
is
the
only
possible
construction
of
the
indictment.
the
most
that
a
general
course
of
conduct
to
mean
in
this
context
is
that
a
single
criminal
impulse
and
a
single
criminal
purpose
underlay
both
of
the
acts
of
concealment
and
the
acts
of
transportation.
it
would
be
consistent
with
this
view
of
the
facts
for
example,
for
petitioner
and
his
codefendants
to
have
intended
on
january
19th
to
conceal
the
automobile
for
purposes
of
sale
and
to
have
taken
the
trip
to
georgia
for
that
purpose
and
perhaps
it
was
unsuccessful
to
return
to
kentucky.
but
we
think
that
even
under
that
--
that
group
of
facts,
assuming
that
would
--
that
were
the
case
before
this
court
that
the
rule
of
lenity
does
not
apply.
i
would
like
to
discuss
in
order
of
the
cases
which
petitioner
has
cited
and
which
this
court
has
applied
the
rule
of
lenity
to
--
in
order
to
forbid
consecutive
sentences.
in
bell
versus
the
united
states,
which
of
course
involved
the
transportation
of
two
women
for
immoral
purposes
across
state
lines
on
the
same
trip,
in
the
same
automobile
at
the
same
time,
therefore,
the
very
same
act
of
transporting
the
--
of
one
woman
also
transported
the
other
woman.
certain
at
the
least,
a
common
transaction
was
involved.
in
fact,
the
court
defined
a
rule
of
lenity
in
the
bell
case,
as
a
rule
and
i
quote,
"against
turning
a
single
transaction
into
multiple
offenses,
unless
the
intent
of
congress
is
clear."
now,
in
the
ladner
case
which
petitioner
also
cites,
person
--
is
all
that
two
federal
officers
while
under
arrest,
perhaps
arguendo
and
the
--
in
the
facts
before
the
court
by
a
single
discharge
of
a
gun.
now,
obviously,
this
is
a
single
act
in
the
narrowest
physical
sense.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
in
the
prince
v.
united
states
which
involved
the
federal
bank
robbery
act,
this
court
held
that
--
that
a
person
couldn't
be
punished
both
for
entry
into
the
bank
with
intent
to
rob
it
and
for
the
completed
robbery.
but
not
only
did
this
involve
what
the
court
called,
a
narrow
question
of
the
unique
statue
of
limited
purpose,
but
the
factual
situation
is
clearly
again,
one
were
both
defenses
are
a
part
of
the
single
continuous
transaction
within
a
very
short
period
of
time.
the
case
in
which
petitioner
principally
relied
in
his
brief
is
the
heflin
case,
which
also
involved
the
federal
bank
robbery
act.
either
the
court
held
that
bank
robbery
could
not
be
separately
punished
for
receiving
money,
he
had
helped
to
steal.
again,
we
think
the
court
was
considering
a
continuous
after
transaction
which
was
intimately
related.
and
in
fact
justice
douglas
speaking
for
the
court
specifically
stated
that
the
issue
before
the
court
was
the
intent
of
congress
in
punishing
multiple
aspects
of
the
same
criminal
act.
the
petitioner
is
suggested
in
his
brief
that
heflin
was
considered
by
the
majority
of
this
court
under
rule
35
and
therefore
only
the
indictment
was
before
this
court.
the
indictment
there
is
not
too
dissimilar
in
the
--
in
the
concealment
count
to
the
--
to
count
3
of
the
indictment
here.
they
were
to
allege
receipt,
concealment,
storage
and
other
--
and
other
similar
words.
petitioner
therefore
suggested
in
heflin
as
here,
if
the
indictment
where
construed
in
the
manner
most
favorable
for
the
government,
totally
separate
acts
of
bank
robbery
and
concealment,
would
have
been
involved
there.
but
we
submit
to
the
heflin,
well,
this
court
could
not
construe
the
indictment
in
the
manner
most
favorable
for
the
government,
since
a
transcript
of
the
trial
was
before
the
court.
it
certainly
would
have
been
strange
for
this
court
to
construe
the
indictment
most
favorably
for
the
government
in
direct
opposition
to
the
facts
which
the
court
knew
to
be
truth.
in
fact,
the
government
urged
there
and
it
cited
the
transcript
that
the
only
facts
there
which
were
--
the
only
acts
by
the
petitioner
there,
which
were
separate
from
the
robbery,
was
the
dividing
up
of
the
loot
and
--
which
lose
immediately
after
the
robbery.
and
no
claim
was
made
for
the
government
that
sometime
later,
separate
acts
of
concealment
unrelated
to
the
robbery
were
armed
--
were
involved.
the
government's
contention
of
separateness
was
the
acts
were
physically
separate.
and
in
fact,
the
court
likewise,
considered
only
the
acts
of
dividing
up
the
loot
in
its
opinion
and
--
and
decided
that
they
were
part
of
the
same
criminal
act.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
facts
do
not
seem
significantly
differ
from
the
woody
case,
but
if
the
woody
case
is
considered
with
the
transcript,
which
it
was
of
course,
before
this
court.
without
the
transcript
which
was
the
position
of
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there
is
some
difference
and
that
the
woody
case
was
the
more
difficult
case
for
the
government.
looking
purely
at
the
indictment,
the
indictment
in
the
woody
case
alleged
that
the
acts
of
--
receipt,
concealment
and
storage,
occurred
on
march
16th,
1954.
that
was
the
same
date
of
the
transportation
alleged
in
the
indictment
in
the
woody
case,
so
it
--
it
would
--
there
was
much
more
possibility
of
the
--
of
the
prisoner
there,
arguing
that
the
acts
were
interrelated.
of
course,
as
it
turned
out
in
the
transcript,
as
this
court
considered
the
case,
that
there
was
a
considerable
separation
and
time
thereto,
between
the
acts
of
--
of
concealment
and
the
acts
of
transportation.
although,
there
was
no
indication
of
course,
whether
there
was
a
different
criminal
purpose
involved,
presumably
there
were
--
the
criminal
purpose
for
both
there
was
keeping
the
car
from
it
--
from
its
owner.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
where
the
storage,
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
a
considerably
more
difficult
case
for
the
government.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
still
think
that
the
congress
intended
to
punish
the
act
separately,
but
that
--
that
issue
would
be
the
much
more
difficult
one,
whether
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
that
this
court
applied
in
heflin,
characterizing
the
statute,
there
is
a
unique
statute.
but
if
it
thought
that
this
statute
was
--
was
similar
and
the
intent
of
congress
was
similar,
then
we
think
that
the
same
result
would
have
to
come
about
in
that
case
as
in
the
heflin
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
three
crimes,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
to
detract
you
mean
that
the
conspiracy
and
the
transportation
and
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
we
think
clearly
the
conspiracy
--
the
conspiracy
is
separate.
your
honor's
decision
mandate,
although
under
a
different
statute,
reaffirms
that
line
of
cases
but
as
to
the
other
two,
we
think
they
were
--
they
are
separate,
but
i
--
i
want
to
emphasize
that
it
is
a
much
more
difficult
case
than
as
before
this
court
and
that
--
and
that
--
that
case
involves
how
far
the
heflin
case
applies
to
other
statutes.
we
think
the
heflin
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
with
the
case
that
is
now
before
the
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
assume
that
when
--
when
the
intent
to
transport
when
the
petitioner
--
when
the
defendants
there
had
their
intent
to
transport,
that
they
had
unitary
intent
in
which
they
decided
they
were
going
to
transport
it
then
they
were
going
to
keep
it
then
perhaps,
they
were
going
to
sell
it
when
they
--
when
they
were
finished.
here,
we
think
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
such
interrelationship
and
time
itself,
makes
a
difference
we
think,
that
if
a
person
that
--
that
contrary
to
what
petitioner
argues,
that
if
a
person
still
transports
a
car
today,
keeps
the
automobile
and
transports
it
across
state
lines
two
years
from
now,
that
these
--
these
are
in
no
--
in
no
way
the
same
criminal
act.
and
so
we
think
time
doesn't
make
a
difference
and
the
three
and
a
half
weeks
itself
makes
a
significant
difference
in
the
case
between
the
one
that
you
post
to
me
in
the
--
in
the
case
here.
but
in
addition,
construing
the
statute,
we
have
an
intermediate
transportation
which
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
petitioner
and
his
two
codefendants
and
we
may
at
well
have
entirely
different
criminal
purposes
and
impulses.
briefly,
we
also
think
that
the
universal
c.i.t.
credit
corporation
case
is
also
very
different.
there,
the
court
did
speak
of
a
course
of
conduct
but
we
like
to
emphasize
that
the
course
of
conduct
there
was
under
each
different
criminal
provision
that
was
a
separate
course
of
conduct
which
this
court
held,
was
separately
punishable.
if
we
apply
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
to
this
case,
then
--
then
a
person
transports
the
same
automobile
twice
couldn't
be
convicted
twice
no
matter
how
much
the
separation
in
time,
but
that
wouldn't
at
all
apply
to
the
facts
of
this
case
that
would
--
it
would
be
a
separate
course
of
conduct
for
concealment,
receipt
and
storage
and
there
would
be
a
course
of
conduct
for
transportation
and
each
one
of
those
would
be
separately
punishable.
finally
your
honors,
petitioners
argue
that
a
person
using
a
--
a
stolen
automobile
over
a
long
period
of
time,
may
cross
numerous
state
lines
and
therefore,
maybe
guilty
of
multiple
offenses
under
the
government's
theory.
i
suggest
that
this
would
make
a
user
of
stolen
automobiles
liable
to
heavier
punishment
than
a
professional
criminal.
well,
this
may
at
times
be
true.
we
cannot
assume
these
pre-charges
will
abuse
their
discretion
by
giving
consecutive
sentences,
when
they
are
undeserved.
and
we
must
assume
the
district
judges
will
properly
exercise
their
discretion
as
did
the
district
judge
here,
when
he
based
petitioner's
punishment
on
the
--
on
his
record,
which
was
not
an
insubstantial
one.
