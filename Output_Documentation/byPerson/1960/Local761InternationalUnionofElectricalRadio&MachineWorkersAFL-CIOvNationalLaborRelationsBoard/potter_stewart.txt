you
think
it
makes
any
difference,
in
this
connection
mr.
sigal,
of
what
kind
of
a
strike
it
is
that
is
so
long
as
it
is
a
lawful
strike,
whether
it's
an
economic
strike
or
strike
for
recognition
or
--
or
what?
justice

stewart
the
strike
in
this
case,
which
led
to
the
picketing,
was
over
some
grievances
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
