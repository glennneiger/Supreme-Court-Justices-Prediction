mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
bars
a
union
from
inducing
employees
to
strike
where
an
object
is
to
put
pressure
on
their
employer
to
cease
doing
business
with
another
employer,
with
whom
the
union
has
its
basic
dispute.
now,
there
is
little
question
that
the
union's
picketing
and
allied
activity
at
gate
3-a
which
was
reserved
the
exclusively
for
the
use
of
the
neutral
contractors
and
their
employees,
meet
the
literal
requirements
or
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
the
gate
was
used
only
by
the
contractors
and
their
employees.
the
picketing
there
induced
the
contractors'
employees
to
stop
work.
and
as
petitioner
admits
and
as
the
board
found,
this
was
the
reason
for
picketing
or
induce
a
concerted
refusal
by
the
contractors'
employees.
now,
the
company
which
is
intervened
in
the
case
whom
you
will
hear
after
i
finished
within
the
matter
there
that
is
since
the
picketing
at
gate
3-a
was
or
the
object
described
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
it
was
necessarily
violative
of
that
provision.
for
the
board,
it
is
a
little
more
difficult
for
the
reason
that
if
you
applied
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
literally,
you
could
leave
no
room
for
the
right
to
engage
in
primary
activity.
and
it's
well
settled
that
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
not
intended
to
obliterate
that
right.
now,
congress
however,
did
not
define
what
they
--
what
it
meant
by
primary
activity,
but
as
we
read
the
legislative
history
and
we
think
our
view
is
supported
by
the
denver
case,
congress
issued
any
of
the
common
law
tests
for
defining
that
activity
because
it
was
something
that
different
jurisdictions
differed
about,
but
instead,
left
the
drawing
of
that
line
to
the
board
by
the
process
of
accommodating
as
this
court
said
in
the
denver
case,
the
dual
congressional
objectives
of
preserving
on
the
one
hand
the
right
of
labor
organizations
to
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
offending
employee
or
employers
in
primary
labor
disputes
and
on
the
other
hand,
of
shielding
unoffending
neutral
employers
in
controversies
not
their
own.
in
short,
we
think
that
with
respect
to
drawing
the
primary
secondary
line,
this
is
an
area,
if
i
may
paraphrase
another
decision
of
this
court
in
the
insurance
workers
case,
where
congress
put
the
question
to
the
board
to
answer.
it
is
analogous
to
the
situation
of
balancing
the
conflicting
interests
with
--
in
republic
aviation,
the
right
of
solicitation
on
company
property.
it's
analogous
to
balancing
the
competing
interest
in
the
buffalo
linen
case
as
to
where
the
right
to
strike
collides
with
the
right
of
the
employers
to
protect
their
bargaining
unit.
it
is
not
like
the
situation
in
curtis
and
insurance
agents
where
congress
answered
the
question
leaving
the
board
little
to
do
but
to
apply
the
direction
of
congress.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
view
the
problem
in
that
setting
because
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
as
to
the
latitude
that
the
board
has
in
this
area
and
to
the
considerations
that
it
can
take
into
account
based
upon
its
experience
in
drawing
the
line
here.
now,
let's
see
how
the
board
has
attempted
to
draw
the
line.
and
i
think
there's
no
trouble
in
the
situation
where
the
primary
employer
and
the
secondary
employer
are
engaged
in
business
at
separate
locations.
i
think
the
union
will
agree
that
in
the
case
where
the
primary
employer
is
fully
operating
at
one
site
which
is
the
rice
milling
situation.
picketing
that
is
confined
to
that
site
can
be
regarded
as
primer.
if
i'll
--
and
if
the
secondary
employer
is
operating
at
another
site,
you
extend
that
picket
line
over
to
the
secondary
site
and
there
seek
to
induce
refusals
to
work,
that
is
secondary.
the
trouble
comes
where
you
have
enmeshed
employment
where
the
primary
employer
and
the
neutral
employer
are
at
work
on
the
same
job
site.
now,
that
is
not
the
traditional
situation
that's
encompassed
by
the
concept
secondary
boycott
or
--
or
primary
strike.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
legislature
history
will
show
that
congress
was
aware
that
they
were
not
precise
terms,
that
there
was
the
unity
of
interest
test
in
some
jurisdictions.
other
jurisdictions
had
a
more
rigid
rule
as
your
honor
is
--
is
well
familiar
with.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
however,
i
should
point
out
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i
said
the
enmeshed
the
employment
situation
is
the
one
that
gives
the
--
the
most
difficulty,
because
what
happens
is
that
if
you
picket
at
those
premises
in
support
of
the
primary
dispute,
you're
necessarily
going
to
have
a
substantial
impact
upon
the
neutral
and
his
employees.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
don't
let
the
union
picket
there,
its
right
to
picket
the
primary
employer
maybe
largely
destroyed
because
since
he
spends
considerable
time
on
those
premises,
that's
the
only
place
that
you
can
reach
him.
now,
the
board,
in
drawing
a
line
between
primary
and
secondary
is
of
the
view
that
in
these
enmeshed
employment
situations,
the
union's
action
will
be
regarded
as
primary
so
long
as
it
has
made
every
effort
to
confine
the
activity
to
the
primary
employer.
however,
--
and
if
there
should
be
any
secondary
work
stoppage
as
a
result
of
that,
well
that
is
incidental
to
the
primary
activity.
obviously,
you
can't
completely
isolate
it
from
the
neutral.
however,
if
the
union
has
gone
beyond
that
and
made
a
--
a
purposeful
effort
to
direct
its
activity
at
the
--
at
the
neutral,
then
the
board
views
that
as
--
as
tipping
the
scales
and
bringing
--
making
the
activity
secondary.
now,
that
was
the
situation
that
this
court
had
before
it
in
the
denver
building
trades
case,
which
was
a
companion
to
rice
milling.
as
mr.
sigal
indicated,
that
involved
the
typical
building
and
construction
situation
where
the
primary
dispute
was
with
a
subcontractor.
the
union
picketed
the
job
site
that
he
worked
on
along
with
other
subcontractors
and
the
general
contractor.
and
it
did
not
confine
its
activity
insofar
as
possible
to
picketing
the
primary
employer,
but
use
signs
and
other
action
which
made
it
clear
that
it
was
inducing
a
concerted
stoppage
of
work
by
the
neutrals.
and
a
violation
was
found
there.
the
board
carried
that
principle
over
to
the
situation
exemplified
by
moore
dry
dock,
where
you
have
--
say
the
primary
employer
has
a
ship
and
that
comes
into
a
neutral's
dry
dock
for
repair.
and
let's
say
as
in
schultz,
he
has
a
truck
and
that
goes
around
making
deliveries
to
neutral
stores.
you
can
picket
at
that
site
so
long
as
you
do
not
make
a
deliberate
effort
to
carry
your
message
beyond
the
primary
employer.
now,
the
thing
that
creates
the
problem
is
that
when
the
board
was
originally
working
out
these
views,
it
did
not
apply
the
enmeshed
employment
rule
to
the
situation
where
the
enmeshed
employment
occurred
on
the
premises
of
the
primary
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
indeed
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
you
had
this
done
not
--
immediately,
it
involved
through
a
series
of
cases.
the
first
case
i
believe
was
the
--
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
is
the
pbm
case
in
about
1953.
that
was
a
situation
where
the
primary
dispute
--
it
was
a
building
and
construction
case
--
was
with
the
general
contractor
has
this
--
who
owned
the
land
and
built
the
buildings
as
distinguished
from
denver,
where
the
dispute
was
with
the
subcontractor
who
was
--
who
was
working
for
the
general
who
was
the
neutral.
it
was
then
carried
over
into
the
crystal
palace
case
where
you
have
the
primary
employer
owning
the
--
a
big
building
in
--
in
san
francisco
which
housed
a
number
of
stalls
that
were
owned
by
independent
sellers
of
--
of
wares
and
then
are
gradually
over
into
the
industrial
situation
that
we
have
here
in
--
in
ge.
now,
let
me
try
to
explain
that
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
there
has
been
a
change
of
view
in
--
in
this
--
to
this
extent
that
the
situation
here
is
similar
to
the
ryan
case
which
mr.
sigal
mentioned.
however,
the
thing
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
that
was
not
a
case
of
this
court,
your
honor.
i
might
say
that
ryan
never
did
get
to
court.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
ryan
decision
is
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
sorry.
it's
at
page
22
of
our
brief,
page
22.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
add
though
that
it
was
an
evaluation
of
the
effect
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
four
cases
that
were
here
in
1951,
plus
the
evolving
nature
of
the
different
fact
situations
that
chained
to
it,
that
prompted
the
board
to
reevaluate
the
situation
in
ryan
because
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
ryan
was
a
situation
where
the
union
had
a
dispute
with
bucyrus
and
ryan
was
an
independent
contractor
who
was
doing
work
for
bucyrus
on
ryan's
premises.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
was
building
a
building
there.
yes,
your
honor.
i
may
have
the
names
reversed,
but
anyhow
the
fellows
were
the
two
entities.
there
was
a
separate
gate
on
the
premises
that
was
used
only
by
the
contractor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
ryan.
the
board
held
that
even
the
picketing
at
that
separate
gate
would
be
regarded
as
primary.
in
other
words,
they
drew
the
line
simply
on
the
basis
of
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
of
geography.
now
in
rice
milling,
this
court
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was
--
for
all
practical
purposes,
it
was,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
--
i
have
the
(voice
overlap)
--
ryan
was
a
--
ryan
was
in
1949.
mr.
norton
j.
come
this
court
decided
before
boycott
cases
in
1951.
mr.
norton
j.
come
rice
and
company.
in
rice,
this
court
--
we
try
to
make
a
sole
geographic
pitch.
in
defense
of
rice,
this
court
rejected
that.
it
said
that
geography,
although
relevant,
was
not
controlling.
moreover,
in
the
denver
case,
the
basis
on
which
the
unions
sought
to
privilege
that
activity,
as
this
was
the
picketing
at
the
--
at
the
construction
project.
and
the
basis
on
which
judge
fahy
for
the
court
of
appeals
had
found
that
it
was
privileged.
and
the
basis
upon
which
judge
clark
had
dissented
in
the
langer
case
which
was
the
companion
was
that
since
it
had
been
confined,
all
the
activity
to
the
job
which
gave
rise
to
the
dispute,
it
was
primary
activity.
in
other
words,
the
job,
geography
was
a
decisive
consideration.
this
court
rejected
that
view.
it
was
the
view
of
the
three
dissenters.
it
was
not
the
view
of
the
majority
opinion.
moreover,
interestingly
enough,
judge
clark
who
i
mentioned,
had
dissented
in
langer,
pointed
out
that
he
couldn't
see
any
logical
difference
between
the
board's
ryan
view
and
the
denver
case
that
they
held
that
it
was
primary.
in
ryan,
they
ought
to
be
holding
that
it
was
primary
in
the
denver
situation.
well,
all
of
those
factors
played
a
part
in
the
board's
reevaluation
of
its
position.
moreover,
you
begin
to
get
cases
as
you
frequently
do
while
your
--
while
you're
dealing
with
an
accommodation
problem.
you
get
fact
situations
to
test
the
validity
of
your
initial
assumptions.
you
begin
to
get
cases
like
the
pbm
case
which
i
indicated,
where
it's
a
converse
of
the
denver
case.the
general
contractor
is
the
one
that
you
have
to
dispute
with.
you
get
cases
like
crystal
palace
where
the
primary
owns
the
building.
and
those
factors,
those
add
a
shadings
effect
test
your
initial
premises.
it
may
induce
you
to
change
them,
the
board
did
change.
those
positions
where
sustained
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
we're
coming
up
here
naked.
it
was
a
shift
from
ryan
to
ge
in
saying,
“take
it,
because
we
now
today
say
this
is
--
this
is
better.”
this
is
something
we
--
we
have
labored
with,
we've
tried
to
work
out
and
accommodate
and
i
think
that
it
has
met
the
test
of
the
--
of
the
courts
of
appeals.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
can't
see
any
meaningful
difference
between
the
situation
here
and
the
situation
in
--
in
denver.
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
heightened
by
petitioner's
concession.
they
concede
in
their
--
in
their
brief
here
that
had
the
dispute
been
with
the
contractors,
ge
could
properly
have
confined
the
picketing
to
gate
3-a.
and
if
the
union
had
gone
to
any
of
the
other
gates,
the
board
could
have
found
a
secondary
boycott.
now,
what
meaningful
difference
does
it
make
to
turn
the
tables
around?
is
there
anything
more
here
than
the
fact
that
in
the
one
case,
the
primary
employer
owns
the
premises
and
in
the
other
case,
he
does
not?
and
petitioner
at
points
in
its
brief
says
that
they
don't
regard
that
as
a
--
as
a
decisive
consideration.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
this
case,
your
honor
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
have
it
to
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
--
your
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
well,
the
closest
case
that
i
can
--
i
can
recall
at
the
moment
is
one
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
here,
so
called
hoosier
pete
case,
which
was
sustained
by
the
seventh
circuit.
now,
that
is
not
a
construction
industry
situation,
but
what
happened
is,
you
had
hoosier
pete,
who
was
hauling
--
i
believe
floyd,
i
guess
his
name
is.
who
was
hauling
gasoline
or
a
concern
called
hoosier
pete,
and
what
he
did
was
he
--
he
set
up
at
one
of
--
of
pete's,
a
gas
station,
his
on
garage
and
that
became
his
--
his
regular
place
of
business
and
he
operated
out
of
that.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
we
had
such
a
case
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
hoosier
pete
case.
it's
--
it's
cited
in
our
--
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
at
pages
--
page
25.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
board
treated
that
as
an
enmeshed
employment
situation.
and
finding
that
the
union
had
not
confined
its
picketing
so
--
insofar
as
possible
floyd,
found
that
there
was
a
--
it
was
secondary
activity,
violative
of
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
and
that
was
affirmed
by
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
next
footnote,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
as
i
say,
when
we
point
out
that
the
--
that
the
only
difference
between
the
situation
that
we
have
here
and
the
--
and
the
converse
which
petitioner
concedes,
the
board
could
properly
find
the
violation
in
his
--
his
ownership
of
property
and
when
they
realized
that,
they
say,
“oh
no,
we're
not
--
we're
not
--
we
don't
think
that
should
be
decisive.”
and
say
the
--
the
other
fact
here
is
that
the
--
that
the
contractor
was
--
was
doing
work
which
directly
benefits
the
primary
employer.
now,
let's
--
let's
test
that
and
see
whether
that
really
is
any
different
from
the
situation
that
we
had
in
denver.
with
the
interdependence
of
the
crafts
on
a
building
and
construction
project,
we
submit
that
it
cannot
be
said
in
any
realistic
sense
that
the
neutral
contractors
in
denver
were
not
involved
or
directly
benefiting
the
non-union
subcontractor.
indeed,
the
relationship
on
a
building
and
construction
project
is
--
is
much
closer
than
it
is
in
an
industrial
situation,
because
of
the
control
of
the
contract
--
the
general
contractor
over
the
job.
it's
--
it's
so
close
that
you
can
make
a
very
substantial
argument
to
the
fact
that
you
don't
have
any
--
any
neutrals
in
such
a
situation
that
are
really
joint
ventures.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
presently
pending
in
the
congress,
bills
that
would
reverse
denver
building
trades
on
--
denver
building
trades
decision
on
--
on
that
very
basis.
significantly
enough,
they
are
not
drawn
so
as
to
include
this
kind
of
a
situation.
of
course,
that
is
causing
great
concerns
of
the
industrial
unions,
but
in
any
event,
in
the
--
in
the
current
thinking
about
this
thing.
it
is
that
the
situation
in
--
in
denver
that
the
relationship
between
the
--
the
various
contractors
is
at
the
even
closer
one
than
you
have
in
this
type
of
situation.
so
that
to
say
that
in
denver,
there
wasn't
any
direct
involvement
of
the
--
of
the
neutrals
with
the
primary
employer
as
you
have
here
is
we
submit,
to
be
very
unrealistic
about
the
practicalities
of
the
situation.
in
any
event,
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
bans
partial
as
well
as
total
work
stoppages
and
therefore,
it's
irrelevant
to
its
application
whether
or
not,
the
neutral
is
--
the
employees
are
being
asked
to
stop
work
for
their
employer
wherever
it
may
be
or
just
the
work
that
they
happen
to
be
doing
for
the
primary
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
board
would
have
treated
that
as
--
as
different,
your
honor,
if
they
belong
to
the
contractors
who
are
working
on
--
on
these
premises
to
the
extent
that
--
that
this
contract,
if
they
were
the
contractors'
trucks.
mr.
norton
j.
come
because
they
both
--
they
were
part
of
the
business
of
the
independent
contractors
who
were
sharing
those
premises.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
way
the
--
that
the
--
the
board
distinguishes
rice
on
the
ground
that
there,
you
did
not
have
any
other
employers
who
were
working
on
that
premises.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
in
rice
milling,
the
premises
were
occupied
solely
by
the
primary
employer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
were
no
competing
interests
that
had
to
be
accommodated
because
you
didn't
have
another
neutral
employer
who
was
working
at
those
premises.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
were
--
they
were
deliverymen
in
rice
milling.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
well,
i
would
like
to
answer
that
by
pointing
and
calling
your
honors'
attention
to
one
development
that
should
be
pointed
out
and
that
is
that
subsequent
to
--
well,
in
the
1959
amendments
to
the
act,
the
landrum-griffin
amendments.
congress
amended
8
(b)
(4)
in
order
to
plug
up
what
they
regarded
as
--
as
loopholes
in
8
(b)
(4).
and
in
doing
that,
they
took
out
the
word,
“concerted.”
that's
set
forth
in
our
--
in
our
brief.
the
reason
they
took
out
the
word
"concerted"
was
that
in
some
--
some
of
the
courts
had
found
that
if
you'd
stop
only
one
secondary
employer
even
at
a
secondary
site,
you
didn't
have
a
violation
because
it
--
it
wasn't
concerted.
so
they
--
they
took
out
the
word,
concerted.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
in
doing
that,
other
congressmen
were
fearful
that
that
would
result
in
that.
so,
what
they
did
was
they
added
a
proviso
which
is
also
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
nothing
construed
herein,
should
affect
the
right
to
engage
in
primary
strikes
or
primary
picketing.
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
which
is
also
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
--
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
46,
points
out
that
they
did
this
in
order
not
to
disturb
the
principles
that
had
been
developed
that
primary
activity
was
not
to
be
covered
by
8
(b)
(4).
they
were
not
adding
to
your
clarification
as
to
what
is
primary
and
what
is
secondary,
but
they
--
they
intended
to
remain
frozen
whatever
limitations
there
were
and
whatever
privileges
there
were.
so
that
i
think
that
they
have
not
overruled
rice
milling,
but
they've
taken
away
the
concerted
problem.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
he
did,
your
honor.
however,
that
has
caused
the
--
an
awful
lot
of
difficulty
with
the
lower
courts
who
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
there
is
some
other
history
which
is
set
forth
i
believe
in
the
aron
article
which
is
on
the
preceding
page
that
specifically
talks
about
rice
milling
as
--
as
well.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
if,
your
--
if
the
court
will
permit,
i'd
be
glad
to
supply
those
after
the
--
the
argument.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
honor.
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
that
i'll
have
to
sit
down
because
i've
trespassed
already
on
mr.
reilly's
time.
