justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
i
may
have
missed,
mr.
sigal
but
did
you
state
when
gate
three
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
1954,
in
reference
to
any
special
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
any
--
any
prophetic
device
of
this
petitioner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
great
forethought?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
great
forethought?
was
this
great
forethought
with
reference
to
this
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
record,
that's
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
suggesting
any
--
you're
not
suggesting
any
devious
purpose
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
the
gate
for
the
--
for
the
ge
employees
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
indicated
that
this
is
a
special
gate
or
a
--
the
most
used
gate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
this
was
a
gate
for
the
employees.
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
how
many
--
through
how
many
gates
did
the
employees,
and
i
take
it
all
the
10,000
and
not
merely
your
union
employees,
come,
how
many
gates
were
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
in
the
corner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
distance
between
a
and
c?
justice
felix
frankfurter
c
is
3-a,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
infer
from
what
you've
said,
perhaps
earnestly
that
most
of
them
came
through
gate
e.
justice
felix
frankfurter
gate
e
and
gate
a.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
500
feet
between
a
and
c?
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
d
and
c?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
c?
justice
felix
frankfurter
c,
b,
a,
i
don't
see
b,
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
well,
between
b
and
c
there's
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
thank
you.
now,
or
are
you
going
to
come
to
that,
did
the
employees
observed
this
--
this
allocation
of
gates
for
them
as
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
--
one
may
--
hear
the
rest
or
your
argument
or
hear
the
rest
of
this
case
and
the
argument
that
the
employees
streamed
through
e
and
b
and
a,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
employees
of
ge
streamed
to
those
two
gates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
that
the
conduct
is
also
proved
that
the
employee
or
the
contractors
or
suppliers
went
through
c?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
clear
that
the
--
that
gate
3-a
was
used
by
those
for
whom
it
was
intended
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
not
used
for
whom
--
those
whom
it
was
not
intended.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
findings
--
but
the
findings
were
different
in
rice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
findings
were
different
wherein,
the
findings
in
this
case
were
different
from
the
findings
in
rice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
in
rice
rested
on
those
findings,
namely
that
there
was
no
endeavor
to
beget
concerted
abstention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
question.
i'm
now
addressing
myself
to
the
fact
that
the
findings
in
this
case
were
directed
against
concerted
abstention.
there
were
no
such
findings
in
rice
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
rested
on
the
specific
findings
in
rice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
order
of
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
findings
on
which
the
order
of
the
board
on
which
the
findings
were
based.
justice
felix
frankfurter
its
purpose
of
talking
at
large.
when
we
talk
of
--
about
courts,
we
talk
about
their
judgment,
when
we
talk
about
the
board
we
talk
about
its
order
and
decisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
you
use
the
exact
words?
it
was
--
it
used
the
terms,
"concert
of
action".
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
wasn't
the
conclusion
in
rice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
--
that
this
disclosing
of
the
case,
i
do
imply
that
it
doesn't
do
any
good
to
rely
on
a
case
which
in
its
findings
is
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
read
me
where
it
said,
it
isn't
the
kind
of
concert
of
action
that
disclosed
trial.
it
dealt
with
two
individuals
and
said
the
fact
that
two
individuals
of
a
secondary
employer
collaborated
with
the
employees
of
the
primary
employer,
did
not
bar
striking
by
the
primary
employer.
that's
all
it
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
here
we
have
no
controversy
that
the
board
did
find
action
directed
towards
concert
of
action,
have
we?
well,
it's
in
the
order
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
evidences
were
things
that
are
not
controversial,
instead
of
agreeing
and
then
going
on
in
making
your
argument
in
reference
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
itself
doesn't
use
the
word
“boycott”,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
anybody
who
knows
the
literature
about
secondary
and
primary
boycott
knows
that
those
terms
are
not
precise
terms
at
bar.
justice
felix
frankfurter
indeed,
congress
i
think
consciously
refused
to
leave
both
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
they're
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
valuable
terms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
they're
not
--
they're
not
precisely
bounded
in
present
terms
like
the
rule
against
perpetuities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
do
that,
may
i
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
go
on
with
the
mr.
chief
justice's
line
of
questions.
when
you
say
the
--
the
commission
hadn't
worked
out
the
--
these
enmeshed
situations
that
you
actually
followed.do
you
mean
that
the
commission
in
the
--
over
the
years
has
changed
its
criteria
for
judgment
or
that
the
facts
in
the
records
before
it
did
not
bring
in
--
did
not
bring
into
clear
and
vivid
aspect,
the
problem
that
we
have
now
before
us.
which
is
it?
had
the
commission
changed
its
views
or
have
--
have
different
fact
situations
brought
its
attention
to
a
consideration
of
views
more
clearly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
case
or
case
of
this
court?
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
charges
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
got
to
explain
the
positions
and
the
change
of
that.
justice
felix

would
you
be
good
enough
--
i
don't
know
what
ryan

ryan

maybe
(voice

--
justice

i
don't.
justice

could
you
tell
us
what
the
position
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
changes
became
and
why
the
changes
in
the
relation
of
all
that
to
this
case.
justice

geography.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
(inaudible)
or
it
never
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
not
only
a
separate,
but
an
exclusive
gate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
rice
and
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
come,
ay
--
has
the
board
had
a
case
or
cases
in
which
the
secondary
employer
actually
had,
other
than
the
construction
case,
the
building
case,
in
which
the
secondary
employer
had
its
own
self-contained
activity
take
place
on
the
premises
of
the
primary
employers,
reference
in
such,
some
subcontractor
as
install
or
temporary
erected
of
the
house
in
which
he
does
the
manufacturing
for
the
primary
employer?
but
on
the
type,
these
vast,
huge
ge's
land
like
the
one,
(inaudible)
the
one
here
which
was
(inaudible)
have
you
had
any
such
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
principles.
i
am
talking
about
industrial
facts,
then
we'll
get
to
the
principles.
have
you
had
any
such
case?
in
this
case,
there
wasn't
--
that
wasn't
the
situation
here,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
where
he
has
a
building
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
he
does,
the
secondary
employers
have
worked
for
the
primary
employer.but
why
is
an
independent
--
independent
industrial
(voice

--
justice
felix

that's
the
kind
of
case
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
wondering
if
you
have
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
was
found
there?
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
your
citation
only
gives
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
believe
the
text
only
gives
the
n.l.r.b.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it.
all
right,
thank
you
very
much.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
come,
suppose
in
this
case,
everything
else
being
the
same,
except
that
only
two
trucks
belonging
to
the
second
--
to
one
of
the
secondary
contractors
for
the
ge
that
gone
through
--
that
gone
through
or
started
to
go
through
3-a
gate,
does
two
named
drivers
of
the
trucks
and
pickets
that
directed
themselves
by
the
finding
of
the
board
merely
against
those
two.
would
that
be
--
would
that
--
am
i
right
in
putting
that
would
be
a
rice
identity,
even
though
it's
a
separate
gate
or
would
it
be
denver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
the
contractors'
trucks,
but
the
board
would've
found
that
just
as
it
found
in
rice,
that
two
designated
employees
of
the
--
of
a
secondary
employer
sought
to
go
through
and
they
simply
said
you
don't
(inaudible)
helping
an
unfair
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
weren't
--
these
fellows
didn't
go
in,
in
order
to
work
on
the
premises?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
too,
but
i
want
to
confine
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
a
finding
by
the
board
that
they
were
not
directing
their
activity
or
their
stoppages
to
the
contractors
as
such
whether
they're
against
two
individual
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
does
that
mean
that
rice
mill
came
up
today,
we
would
have
to
decide
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
contrary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
must
say
i'm
glad
i
don't
have
to
decide
that
case
here
because
to
me,
that's
properly
mumbo-jumbo
and
properly
be
going
--
trying
to
go
at
same
time
in
opposite
directions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
for
me,
rice
milling
largely
goes
on
the
non-finding
has
considered
this.
the
court
so
said
and
just
referred
to
(inaudible)
on
so
many
words,
doesn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
the
--
the
--
exactly
what
you
referred
them
on
page
46.
justice
felix
frankfurter
test
that
a
lot
of
words
and
then
say
see
for
example
and
the
(inaudible)
are
denver
building,
moore
dry

etcetera.
it
doesn't
say
see
rice,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
was
in
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
referred
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
committee
report
by
way
of
an
article
of
law
review.
i
must
say
i
greatly
respect
of
origin
your
article's
signature,
but
i
didn't
know
reached
that
light.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you're
obliged
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
view,
mr.
reilly,
as
to
the
bearing
of
the
new
legislation
to
the
precise
issue
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
--
in
the
report?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
read
that
and
restricting
myself
to
the
reading
of
what
is
quoted
on
page
46
of
the
government's
brief,
the
--
that
merely
speaks
--
that's
in
dearly,
an
affirmation
of
declaratory
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
withstand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wanted
to
make
clear
that
the
8
(b)
(4)
doesn't
involve
picketing
at
the
site
of
a
primary
labor
dispute
as
to
the
involvements
of
what
that
authorizes
and
leave
it
more
common
--
this
court
ultimately
working
out
of
the
common
law
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
(inaudible),
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
shows
no
light,
one
with
neither
light
nor
darkness.
exactly.
i
think
that
the
real
light
is
thrown
by
going
back
to
the
debates
on
the
taft-hartley
act
and
--
and
reading
senator
taft's
remarks
in
context
in
--
in
recognizing
that
he
was
defending
his
bill
because
it
didn't
go
too
far
rather
than
--
rather
than
asking
some
contention
that
the
effect
of
section
8
(b)
4
(a)
was
to
prohibit
primary
strikes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
find
every
time
we
have
a
case,
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
legislative
history
all
over
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
certainly
don't
trust
my
memory
a
lot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
you
criteria?
does
the
--
the
site
and
is
the
site
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
had
a
secondary
--
suppose
you
had
a
secondary
employer
at
his
own
site
miles
away,
does
work
exclusively
or
produces
good
exclusively
for
the
primary
employer.
what
would
you
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
be
the
relevance
in
your
view
of
that
type?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
therefore,
the
--
doing
work
for
or
helping
forth
is
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
just
a
comparison
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
in
fact
or
which
by
itself,
they
do
just
as
much
damage
or
be
just
as
much
help
to
the
primary
employer
and
yet
would
not
fall
within
the
right
to
picket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
should
geography
be
still
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
traditional,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
does
it
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
i'm
sure
you
know
that
--
that
the
four
legislation
dealt
with
these
problems,
traditional
vary
from
state
to
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
traditional
varied
from
labor
organization
to
labor
organization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
determine
that?
i
couldn't
to
save
my
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
traditional
this
thing
was,
secondary
boycott
and
you
look
at
the
--
look
at
the
cases
of
the
--
at
the
time
of
(inaudible)
look
at
the
whole
materials
of
this
or
in
those
are
to
their
statements
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
it's
a
very
treacherous
ground
to
talk
about
what
is
traditional
and
this
subject
of
--
of
the
extension
which
strike
picketing
as
has
been
used
by
the
organizations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
1959
act
shows
how
at
large,
congress
left
it
by
saying
whatever
the
law
is,
it
shall
be
the
law,
whether
the
law
is,
is
what
courts
evolve
the
law
to
be,
including
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
--
i
take
it,
what
was
implied,
as
i
understood
it
was
that
the
rice
milling
was
treated
as
an
isolated
instance.
i
have
no
more
knowledge
or
i
--
that
rice
milling
can
mean
no
more
to
me
then
it
can
to
you,
because
once
an
opinion
is
added,
that's
what
we
look
at.
and
that's
what
i
read
rice
milling,
was
