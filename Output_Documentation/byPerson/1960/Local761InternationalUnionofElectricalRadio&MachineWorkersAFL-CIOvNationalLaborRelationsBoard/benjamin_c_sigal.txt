mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
this
case
held
that
the
petitioner
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
as
it
appeared
prior
to
amendment
in
1949,
by
inducing
and
encouraging
the
employees
of
independent
contractors
to
engage
in
a
concerted
refusal
to
work
with
an
object
of
forcing
the
independent
contractors
to
cease
doing
business
with
the
general
electric
company
and
in
order
that
the
petitioner
cease
and
desist
from
that
conduct,
not
only
as
to
these
independent
contractors
but
as
to
any
other
--
as
to
the
employees
of
any
other
employer.
now,
the
facts
are
these.
the
petitioner
represents
and
there
at
that
time,
the
production
and
maintenance
employees
of
the
general
electric
company
at
its
appliance
park
plant
near
louisville,
kentucky.
there
were
about
10,000
employees
altogether
at
the
plant
at
that
time
than
--
of
which
the
petitioner
represented
about
7600.
the
principal
products
of
this
plant
are
electrical
appliances
such
as
dishwashers,
dryers,
washers,
room
air-conditioning
units
and
appliances
of
that
kind.
now,
the
appliance
park
plant
consists
of
a
collection
a
collection
of
13
buildings
on
a
large
tract
of
land,
consisting
about
1000
acres.
six
of
the
buildings
are
used
directly
for
production
purposes
and
the
others
for
servicing
the
production
processes.
access
to
the
plant
is
obtained
by
five
road
ways
crossing
a
culvert
which
surrounds
the
plant
and
these
roadways
are
called
gates.
most
of
the
employees,
the
customers
and
others
wanting
to
enter
the
plant
do
so
by
way
of
these
roadways.
now,
in
1958
and
from
time
to
time
prior
to
that,
the
company
had
entered
into
contracts
with
independent
contractors
for
work
to
be
done
on
its
buildings
in
this
--
on
this
site
and
on
the
grounds
as
well
and
the
work
consisted
of
general
maintenance
work
and
also
for
installation,
repair
and
alteration
of
the
facilities
in
the
plants
and
most
important,
work
in
converting
to
the
manufacturer
of
new
models
of
these
various
appliances
such
as
retooling,
rearrangement
of
conveyors
and
so
forth.
some
of
this
work
had
been
done
and
it
could
be
done
by
the
employees
of
general
electric
if
they
were
available
at
the
time
and
there
was
also
a
unique
competitive
system
within
the
company
by
which
one
of
the
departments
or
service
department
bid
on
certain
types
of
alterations
and
maintenance
work.
and
if
their
bid
was
lower
than
that
of
the
independent
contractor,
they
obtained
the
work
otherwise
it
went
to
an
independent
contractor.
now,
in
1954,
the
company
had
issued
instructions
that
one
of
these
five
gates,
namely
which
was
numbered
3-a
to
be
used
only
by
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors
whereas
the
other
gates
could
be
used
by
its
own
employees
and
also
by
the
employees
of
suppliers,
other
customers
and
so
forth.
now,
the
reason
for
this
action
was
that
there
had
been
a
number
of
strikes
of
the
craftsmen
of
the
--
in
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors
which
had
involved
the
employees
of
ge
and
therefore,
they
set
aside
this
particular
gate
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
employees
of
the
contractors.
now,
this
gate
was
of
course
used
by
any
contractor
and
not
just
by
those
who
happen
to
be
involved
in
this
case.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
strike
which
occurred
in
this
case
--
which
occurred
in
july
of
1958,
there
were
--
contracts
had
been
given
to
12
independent
contractors,
half
of
whom
had
already
started
their
work
on
those
particular
contracts.
most
--
one
of
them,
they
worked
on
--
one
of
them
had
gone
--
it
begun
as
far
back
as
january
of
1958,
none
had
gone
back
before
that.
however,
there
were
a
couple
of
these
contractors
who
had
worked
on
these
premises
on
other
contracts
from
time
to
time
over
a
period
of
two,
three,
or
four
years.
as
to
the
other
contractors,
they
hadn't
even
begun
doing
the
work
which
they
had
contracted
to
do
for
general
electric
at
this
time.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
in
1954.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
not
special
except
as
i
indicated.
there
had
been
a
number
of
jurisdictional
disputes,
strikes
among
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
and
that
was
the
reason,
but
there
was
--
so
far
as
i
think
the
record
--
no,
the
record
does
not
say
there
was
anything
special
in
1954.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
know
if
anything
--
prior
to
that
time
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
sorry?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
doubt
it
because
there
had
been
no
strikes
by
the
employees
of
general
electric
company
prior
to
that
time
and
the
one
that
occurred
in
this
case
was
a
first
one
that
occurred
which
was
four
years
later.
they
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
they
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
that
time
that
the
reason
they
set
it
up
was
to
insulate
their
employees
from
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors
who
had
been
engaged
up
to
that
time
in
about
22
jurisdictional
strikes
up
to
--
from
the
time
the
plant
opened
which
was
only
about
four
or
three
years
earlier.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
no.
i
don't
think
they
had
anything
like
that
in
mind
as
to
--
as
the
problem
arose
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
employees
of
these
contractors,
only
about
half
of
dozen
had
testified
and
three
of
them
said
that
they
had
begun
--
worked
only
two
days
before
the
strike
in
this
case.
two
others
that
said
that
they
had
began
to
work
at
--
after
the
strike
began
and
one
or
two
testified
they
--
their
work
had
gone
on
for
about
six
months
or
more.
that's
all
the
testimony
there
was
as
to
the
length
of
work
by
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors.
now,
the
work
done,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
was
done
primarily
on
the
buildings
and,
in
the
buildings
rather,
in
which
the
strikers
worked
and
there
was
no
building,
no
permanent
building
for
the
contractors
themselves.
now,
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
just
to
examine
for
a
moment
the
map
which
appears
after
page
170
in
the
record.
you'll
note
that
this
has
--
the
tract
of
land
is
rectangular.
the
gates
--
the
gate
involved
here,
3-a
is
on
the
right
hand
side
of
that
rectangle.
now,
gate
around
--
but
the
middle
of
that
right
hand
side,
you'll
note
letter
a.
that
was
a
gate
intended
for
the
employees
and
visitors.
above
that
was
gate
b
--
was
gate
number
3
--
that
is
b
--
it
was
gate
number
3
and
then
above
that
is
c
which
is
3-a.
now,
that
is
the
gate
which
is
involved
in
this
proceeding.
now,
when
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors
went
into
that
gate,
they
turned
left
and
a
number
of
them
went
to
work
in
the
first
building,
in
building
number
1
and
a
number
of
them
went
almost
the
whole
length
of
that
tract
and
went
to
work
in
building
number
--
which
is
marked
here
as
building
number
5,
5
dealt
with
--
manufactured
household
refrigerators,
1
manufactured
the
home
laundry
equipment.
now,
when
the
--
well,
i
should
note
also
that
in
addition
to
these
three
entrances,
there's
one
on
the
far
left
corner
of
this
tract,
that
was
a
gate
for
employees
and
there's
one
at
the
top
of
that
rectangle
which
is
also
a
gate
which
is
a
--
take
gate
where
truckers
came
in,
employees
of
suppliers
and
a
gate
through
which
the
product
of
the
company
was
taken
out
by
the
employees
of
truckers
and
other
--
and
customers
and
so
forth.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
the
other
four
gates
could
be
used
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
by
ge
employees.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
it
was
just
one
of
the
gates.
i
had
misspoke
if
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
one
of
the
gates,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
there
was
nothing
to
preclude
them
as
i
understand
it
from
using
any
of
those
four
gates,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
for
the
most
part,
they
used
the
gate
which
is
designated
e.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
at
the
far
left
hand
corner
and
they
also
used
the
gate
which
is
designated
a
on
the
right
hand
side
of
that
rectangle.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
about
--
between
a
and
c,
about
500
feet.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
c
is
3-a,
yes.
now,
there
is
a
distance
so
about
a
mile
between
the
employee
gate
e
and
employee
gate
a.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
gate
e
and
gate
a.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
which
is
--
that
has
been
marked
e
and
a.
they
are
numbered
otherwise,
yes.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
i
think
what
the
record
shows,
500
feet
between
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
between
a
--
between
b
and
c.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
b.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
on
the
right
of
that,
it's
hard
to
read
there
but
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
b.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
between
a
and
c
there's
a
b.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
between
b
and
c,
that's
--
i
think
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
practically
so.
in
the
--
in
the
hearing
in
this
case,
there
was
some
evidence
that
on
a
few
occasions
over
the
years,
the
ge
employees
used
gate
3-a.
however,
the
board
found
and
we
have
not
contested
the
fact
that
gate
3-a
was
used
exclusively,
it
certainly
was
intended
for
the
exclusive
use
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
of
the
independent
contractor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
employees,
yes,
of
ge.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
i
think.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
employees
of
the
--
of
the
independent
contractors
and
the
suppliers
of
the
independent
contractors
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
went
through
that
gate.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but
the
employees
of
other
--
other
suppliers
of
ge
went
through
the
other
gates
particularly
gate
b
and
gate
d
which
was
as
marked
b
and
d.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
--
that's
a
position
we're
taking
here,
although
we
did
--
there
was
some
evidence
to
the
contrary
in
the
early
parts
of
the
case.
now,
when
the
strike
began,
there
is
no
question
it
was
a
lawful
strike
at
all
times.
it
was
over
the
question
of
unresolved
grievances.
the
petitioner
placed
pickets
at
all
five
gates,
picketed
all
of
them
in
exactly
the
same
way
and
carried
the
same
kind
of
sign,
namely
“local
761
on
strike,
ge
unfair.”
there
was
no
question
in
the
case
as
to
the
identification
of
the
employer
with
whom
the
--
against
to
whom
the
petitioner
was
striking
and
the
trial
examiner
so
found,
the
board
didn't
challenge
that
fact.
now,
in
addition
to
the
--
using
the
picket
signs,
the
employees
on
strike
also
made
some
oral
appeal
to
the
employees
of
the
contractors
when
they
approached
the
line,
the
only
place
where
these
oral
appeals
were
made
when
the
--
when
the
employees
and
the
contractors
approached
the
picket
line
at
gate
3-a.
there
was
no
attempt,
no
effort
on
the
part
of
the
pickets
to
halt
the
operations
of
any
contractor
at
any
place
other
than
at
appliance
part
and
the
trial
examiner
so
found
and
there
is
so
--
and
the
board
adopted
that
finding.
now,
most
of
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors
observed
the
line
and
did
not
go
through.
a
few
of
them
did
come
to
the
line
as
to
--
and
asked
permission
to
remove
their
tools
so
that
they
could
work
elsewhere
and
this
permission
was
granted.
in
one
or
two
instances,
they
were
told
to
go
to
the
office
of
the
union.
there,
they
were
given
a
pass,
they
went
through
and
got
--
obtained
their
tools
and
left
and
went
to
other
jobs
which
the
--
their
particular
employers
have.
now,
as
i
--
i've
already
indicated
gates
3
and
4
were
used
by
the
employees
of
the
suppliers
of
ge
by
their
customers,
by
visitors
as
well
as
by
the
employees
of
ge.
during
the
strike,
the
company
made
it
very
clear
through
use
of
radio
and
television
and
so
forth
that
it
was
continuing
the
operation
of
a
plant
and
there
was
--
was
open
for
anybody
who
wanted
to
do
business
with
them.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
about
5000
employees
altogether
did
go
through
the
--
to
work
in
the
plant.
that
is
about
3000
of
the
non-bargaining
unit
before
and
about
2000
of
those
of
the
bargaining
unit
did
go
in
and
the
plant
operated
to
some
extent.
now,
at
the
hearing
before
the
trial
examiner,
the
representative
of
the
general
counsel
made
--
was
quite
explicit
in
saying
that
the
--
if
the
contractors
and
their
employees
had
used
the
same
--
that
is
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors,
had
used
the
same
gate
as
the
other
employees,
there
would
have
been
no
case.
it
was
a
bit
no
unfair
labor
practice,
and
the
case,
as
the
general
counsel
presented
it
to
the
trial
examiner,
rested
on
the
distinction
between
the
separate
gate
set
aside
for
the
--
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors
and
the
shared
gate
which
was
of
course
the
other
four
gates.
now,
the
trial
examiner
found
specifically
that
the
pickets
made
it
clear
that
their
dispute
was
with
the
general
electric
company
only
and
that
there
was
no
effort
to
halt
the
operations
of
any
of
the
independent
contractors
anywhere
outside
that
project
and
he
concluded
that
the
object
of
the
picketing
at
appliance
park
was
to
halt
the
operations
of
the
struck
plant,
that
is
a
ge
plant,
by
appeals
directed
selectively
to
the
company's
employees,
to
the
consuming
public
and
to
the
employees
of
neutral
employers
who
were
transporting
materials
in
and
out
of
the
plant.
and
he
concluded,
after
an
exhausted
review
of
the
precedents,
that
this
was
clearly
valid
primary
activity
and
there
was
no
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
the
board
reversed
the
conclusions
of
the
trial
examiner.
it
adopted
his
findings
and
sub
--
certainly,
didn't
set
aside
any
findings
of
his
specifically
and
held
that
the
--
the
--
without
expressing
any
rationality
for
--
rationality
for
its
action
that
the
object
of
the
petitioners
was
to
enmesh
the
employees
of
the
independent
contractors
in
its
dispute
with
ge
which
object
was
shown
by
picketing
the
reserved
gate
and
making
oral
appeals
to
those
employees.
that
was
the
entire
statement
of
the
board
for
--
reason
for
reversing
the
trial
examiner.
no
other
justification
or
rationality
was
expressed.
it
issued
its
order
for
the
petitioners
to
cease
and
desist
not
only
from
this
conduct
with
respect
to
the
employees
of
independent
contractors,
but
for
the
employees
of
every
other
contractor,
customer
and
so
forth.
the
court
upheld
the
board
–
no
the
court
below.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
as
it
is
framed
by
the
briefs
here
is
as
we
see
it
or
at
least
as
we
see
it,
is
follows.
this
is
permissible
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
deliberately,
to
induce
employees
or
customers,
suppliers
and
others
who
perform
services
for
a
primary
employer
to
refrain
from
rendering
services
to
--
for
the
benefit
of
the
primary
employer
at
his
place
of
business
during
a
labor
dispute
between
a
primary
employer
and
his
employees.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
the
purpose
of
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
gate
3-a
was
exclusive
you
mean?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
we
--
we
accept
the
finding
that
gate
3-a
was
exclusively
for
the
use
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
board
made
no
findings
or
facts
itself.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
we
accept
the
findings
of
fact,
yes.
we
accept
the
findings
of
fact
because
the
--
the
--
made
by
the
trial
examiner
and
as
we
see
it,
those
findings
were
adopted
by
the
board.
now,
there's
one
--
one
difference
with
respect
to
the
findings
of
fact.
the
trial
examiner
made
no
finding
as
to
whether
or
not
gate
3-a
had
been
set
aside
exclusively
for
the
employees
of
independent
contractors.
he
said
that
for
--
in
his
view
of
the
case,
it
made
no
difference.
the
board
found,
however,
that
it
was
set
--
that
the
gate
was
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
--
exclusive
use
of
these
employees,
of
the
independent
contractors
and
we
are
not
challenging
that
finding.
now,
aside
from
that,
there
is
no
--
so
far
as
we
see
it,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
board
and
the
trial
examiner
and
of
course
we
are
resting
on
the
findings
as
they
are
made
taking
the
trial
examiner's
report
and
the
board's
statement
together.
now,
so
far
as
the
issue
is
concerned,
petitioner
of
course
says
that
the
--
it
did
have
the
right
and
does
have
the
right
to
make
these
--
to
deliberately
to
induce
employees
or
independent
contractors
to
do
what
was
done
in
this
case.
the
board
says
that
sometimes
it
is
lawful
to
do
so
and
sometimes
it
isn't,
depending
on
the
duration
of
the
work
of
the
employer
--
of
the
independent
contractor
on
the
premises
of
the
primary
employer.
that's
--
we'll
go
into
that
--
for
what
in
the
course
of
the
argument.
the
company
here
apparently
takes
the
position
that
there
is
no
right
to
induce
the
employees
of
independent
contractors
at
any
time
except
perhaps
--
except
an
individual
employee.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
close
of
the
session
yesterday,
i
pointed
out
what
i
considered
to
be
the
issue
in
this
case,
namely,
is
it
permissible
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
act
deliberately
to
induce
employees
of
customers,
suppliers
and
others
who
perform
services
for
a
primary
employer
to
refrain
from
rendering
services
or
benefit
to
the
primary
employer
at
his
place
of
business
during
a
labor
dispute
between
the
primary
employer
and
his
employees.
now,
we
submit
that
that
question
has
been
answered
in
the
affirmative
by
this
court
in
the
international
rice
milling
case.
now,
in
that
case,
the
court
dealt
with
an
offending
--
with
a
picketing
of
an
offending
employer
in
a
primary
dispute.
the
union
there
sought
to
organize
the
employees
of
a
kaplan
mill
and
picketed
the
mill
with
signs
saying,
“this
job
is
unfair
to
the
union.”
when
two
employees
of
a
customer
of
the
kaplan
mill
came
in
the
course
of
their
employment
for
their
employer
to
the
mill,
the
picket
stopped
them
and
told
them
to
turn
back.
now,
the
board
held
that
since
these
activities,
this
picketing,
arose
out
of
primary
picketing
of
the
kaplan
mill
and
were
a
carryout
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
mill,
they
were
lawful.
the
fifth
circuit
court
reversed
and
then
--
and
this
court
unanimously
reversed
the
fifth
circuit
and
upheld
the
board.
now,
among
other
things,
it
pointed
out
that
section
7
and
13
of
the
act
and
immaterial
legislative
history
of
the
act,
supports
the
court's
statement
that
nothing
in
8
(b)
(4)
is
to
be
construed
to
interfere
with,
impede
or
diminish
the
union's
traditional
right
to
strike.
and
that
congress
did
not
seek
in
that
section
to
interfere
with
the
ordinary
strike.
and
before
analyzing
this
case
further,
i'd
like
to
mention
also
the
denver
building
and
construction
case
which
was
decided
on
the
same
day.
now,
in
that
case,
the
primary
employer
was
a
subcontractor
employing
non-union
laborer.
the
union
called
a
strike
against
the
neutral
general
contractor
picketing
with
signs
saying,
“this
job
is
unfair,”
in
order
to
force
him
to
terminate
his
contract
with
the
primary
employer,
namely
the
subcontractor.
the
court
held
that
that
was
prohibited
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
and
there
--
and
affirmed
the
board.
he
pointed
out
that
the
only
way
the
union
could
have
obtained
its
strike
objective
was
to
force
the
neutral
employer,
the
--
to
back
--
to
break
his
contract
with
the
subcontractor.
and
having
achieved
that
--
that
was
--
would've
been
the
end
and
was
the
end
in
that
case
of
the
picketing.
now,
the
court
contrasted
denver
with
rice
milling
in
the
denver
case.
they
declared
in
rice
milling,
the
union
was
seeking
recognition
from
the
primary
employer
and
that
its
action
in
seeking
to
influence
the
employees
of
a
customer
of
--
then
kaplan
mill
was
no
more
than
traditional
and
permissible
in
a
primary
strike.
it
said
further
that
the
union
was
not
striking
against
the
customer
and
was
not
encouraging
concerted
action
by
the
customer's
employees
to
force
the
customer
to
boycott
the
mill.
now,
this
statement
in
denver
illumines
the
statements
of
the
court
in
rice
milling,
that
a
union's
inducements
reaching
individual
employees
of
neutral
employer
only
as
they
happen
to
approach
the
picketed
place
of
business,
generally
are
not
aimed
at
concerted,
as
distinguished
from
individual
conduct
by
such
employees.
and
the
court
stated
that
there
was
no
inducement
of
concerted
action
there
of
the
kind
proscribed
by
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
now,
in
denver,
the
court
also
approved
the
approach
of
the
board
in
the
several
cases
which
it
had
presented
to
the
board
in
the
course
of
its
--
stating
its
rationality
--
and
rationality.
one
of
its
--
the
cases
was
the
ryan
case.
now,
ryan
was
almost
identical
with
the
case
at
bar.
in
that
case,
ryan
was
a
contractor
engaged
in
constructing
in
addition
to
the
bucyrus
plant
located
on
the
35-acre
tract,
enclosed
by
a
wire
fence.
now,
about
500
feet
from
the
main
gate
and
near
the
construction
area,
bucyrus
had
installed
a
separate
gate
for
the
use
of
the
ryan
employees
and
for
the
suppliers
of
ryan.
in
the
course
of
a
strike
against
the
bucyrus,
the
union
picketed
all
entrances
of
bucyrus
including
the
gate
--
the
ryan
gate,
publicizing
a
dispute
with
signs
most
of
which
did
not
identify
bucyrus.
ryan's
employee
did
not
cross
the
picket
line.
the
board
held
that
this
was
primary
picketing
and
it
made
no
difference
whether
1
or
100
employees
refused
to
cross
or
wished
to
enter
and
refuse
to
cross
the
picket
line.
and
the
picketing
did
not
lose
its
primary
character
in
support
of
a
labor
dispute
with
bucyrus
because
the
ryan
employees
were
the
only
ones
who
didn't
cross
or
that
rather
the
only
ones
who
used
that
gate.
now,
the
court
--
this
court
cited
that
case
and
the
action
there
as
the
--
as
an
ordinary
strike.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
i
think
it's
--
that
makes
no
difference
--
if
it's
a
law
--
so
long
as
it's
a
lawful
strike,
certainly.
and
if
you're
now
talking
about
the
--
the
question
of
picketing
and
so
long
as
the
picketing
is
--
and
the
conduct
is
in
the
traditional
fashion,
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
and
there
was
no
issue
raised
as
to
the
legality
of
the
strike.
that
was
conceded
by
all
parties.
now,
in
the
denver
case,
the
union
sought
to
have
the
employees
of
a
general
contractor
that
is
the
neutral
employer,
stopped
work
for
the
purpose
of
causing
him
to
terminate
his
contract
with
a
neutral
employer.
now,
it
must
be
pointed
out
in
that
case
--
that
in
that
case,
the
employees
of
a
general
contractor
were
not
performing
work
for
the
primary
employer
who
was
the
subcontractor.
now,
with
the
aid
of
the
rationale
provided
by
the
board,
this
--
this
court
said
that
in
the
views
of
the
board
as
applied
in
the
denver
case,
this
court
found
conformity
with
the
dual
congressional
objectives
to
protect
--
to
preserve
the
right
to
bring
up
labor
organizations,
to
bring
pressure
against
offending
employers
in
a
primary
labor
dispute
and
to
shield
unoffending
employers
and
others
from
pressures
in
controversies
not
their
own.
now,
a
minority
of
this
court
at
that
time
believed
that
the
decision
unduly
restricted
the
right
to
picket
and
strike.
and
that
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
should
reach
only
the
case
where
the
industrial
dispute
spreads
from
the
job
to
another
front.
now,
before
examining
the
extent
to
which
the
board
has
departed
from
the
views
it
supported
in
rice
milling
and
denver
in
which
views
were
upheld
by
this
court
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
--
but
the
question
is
what
was
concerted
abstention
among
other
questions.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
the
court
--
if
just
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
findings
of
the
trial
examiner
which
were
adopted
--
the
findings
of
fact
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
order
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
--
the
board
did
conclude
in
this
case
that
the
intention
of
the
union
was
to
enmesh
the
sect
of
the
employees
of
the
neutral
employers.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that
--
that
was
a
conclusion
of
the
court
--
of
the
board,
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but
we
submit
that
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
will
--
i
simply
want
to
point
that
the
definition
that
what
the
court
meant
and
when
it
said
that
there
was
no
concert
of
action,
it
did
not
--
it
was
not
referring
to
the
type
that
i
think
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
referring
to.
it
said
that
the
employees,
the
action
in
stopping
the
two
employees
was
not
concerted,
the
kind
of
concert
of
action
which
was
proscribed.
it
did
not
say
that
there
was
not
concert
of
action.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
i
--
i
will
give
you
the
language,
your
honor.
i
have
it
quoted
in
the
brief.
i
submit
that
this
language
that
i
suggest
--
that
i
--
that
i
have
just
quoted
is
in
the
court's
opinion.
now,
if
i
may
proceed,
i
will
return
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
now,
we
--
the
--
the
court
used
this
language.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
on
page
66.
we
have
quoted
in
part
on
page
66
of
our
brief
in
which
it
observed
--
at
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
the
court
observed
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
proscribes
only,
“encouragement
to
some
concert
of
action
greater
than
the
refusal
of
employees
of
a
neutral
employer
to
cross
the
picket
line.”
the
--
the
words
quoted
were,
“encouragement
to
some
concert
of
action
greater
then.”
i
--
i
submit
that
the
court
in
that
case
clearly
understood
that
there
was
concert
of
action,
but
the
question
was,
“was
it
concert
of
action
which
was
prescribed
by
8
(b)
(4)
(a)?”
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
board
--
the
board
found
--
yes.
that
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
there
was
concert
of
action.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
we
submit
that
the
board
was
wrong.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
--
i
would
simply
want
to
add
that
so
far
as
the
findings
were
concerned,
the
board
did
not
contravene
any
of
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
trial
examiner.
now,
if
i
may
proceed.
the
board
in
its
brief
here
makes
certain
important
concessions
which
narrow
the
area
of
contention.
first,
the
board
concedes
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
is
not
to
be
read
literally,
since
to
do
so
would
mean
the
banning
of
nearly
all
strikes.
it
concedes
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
to
interfere
with
the
ordinary
or
primary
strike.
it
concedes
that
the
threshold
question
is
whether
the
challenged
activity
is
primary
or
secondary.
and
it
concedes
that
the
right
to
engage
in
picketing
in
the
light
activity
in
a
dispute
where
the
primary
employer
includes
the
right
not
only
to
appeal
to
the
employees
of
the
primary
employer,
but
also
to
influence
third
persons
to
withhold
their
business
or
service
from
the
struck
employer.
now,
it
concedes
further
that
after
the
decision
of
the
--
this
court
in
rice
milling
and
denver,
it
changed
its
opinions
or
its
views
with
respect
to
the
--
this
matter
and
began
to
reevaluate
and
started
on
an
entirely
different
course,
which
ends
in
part
in
the
case
we
have
here.
it
took
the
position
that
it
could
--
that
the
denver
decision
left
the
three
to
jettison
the
original
approach
which
was
approved
by
this
court.
term
--
predicated
on
the
terms
of
the
act
in
the
legislative
history
and
traditional
strike
activities.
and
it
now
says
that
under
this
new
approach,
duration
of
the
employment
at
the
place
of
the
primary
employer
is
the
criterion
as
to
determine
whether
the
action
is
secondary
or
primary.
under
the
present
view
of
the
board,
it
is
no
longer
pertinent
whether
the
situs
of
the
dispute
is
on
the
premises
of
the
primary
employer
and
it
is
no
longer
pertinent
whether
the
work
is
done
by
the
neutral
for
the
primary
employer.
now,
in
their
view,
the
primary
consideration
is
whether
the
employer,
that
is
the
primary
employer,
uses
the
premises
--
that
is
whether
the
neutral
employer
uses
the
premises
along
with
the
primary
employer
in
a
substantial
and
continuous
manner
as
a
regular
workplace.
if
he
does,
then
the
picketing,
if
it
is
not
confined
to
picketing
of
the
employees
of
the
primary
employer,
the
--
maybe
secondary
--
maybe
prohibited
because
then
the
union
unnecessarily
directs
its
picketing
at
the
neutral
employees.
now,
the
reason
for
this
as
distinguished
from
principle
is
that
the
picketing
is
focused
upon
neutral
employers
who
work
steadily
at
the
site
of
the
dispute
and
thereby
may
injure,
may
injure
the
employer
more
seriously
than
where
he
is
only
a
transient.
now,
we
say
that
this
approach
determining
the
matter
on
the
basis
of
injury
is
entirely
outside
the
act.
is
not
authorized
by
act
and
in
--
in
effect
constitutes
administrative
legislation.
the
question
is
--
should
be
directed
to
the
question
of
the
right
to
primary
picketing
of
the
--
the
picketing
of
the
primary
employer
and
not
to
the
question
of
injury,
this
--
or
the
degree
injury
of
the
secondary
employer.
now,
the
board
feels
or
takes
the
position
that
it
has
a
right
simply
to
balance
interests
and
to
determine
when
the
strike
pressure
is
adequate.
we'd
say
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
gives
--
that
says
that
adequacy
of
strike
pressure
is
a
criterion.
now,
in
--
in
the
guise
of
administration,
it
has
placed
limitations
which
congress
has
not
placed
on
striking
and
picketing.
now,
it
is
our
view
that
just
as
this
court
held
in
the
insurance
agent's
case
that
congress
did
not
allow
the
board
in
the
guise
of
determining
good
or
bad
faith
in
negotiations
to
regulate
what
economic
weapons
a
party
might
summon
to
its
aid.
and
just
as
in
curtis,
it
held
--
this
court
held
that
the
board
could
not
in
the
guise
of
administration
condemn
picketing
for
recognition
by
a
minority
union,
because
it
disapproves
of
the
economic
pressures
which
were
generated.
so
we
say
the
court
must
not
be
allowed
to
condemn
primary
picketing
because
it
believes
picketing
is
necessary
or
that
the
economic
consequences
on
neutrals
are
too
severe.
i
would
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
thank
you.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
i'd
like
to
advert
to
several
of
the
arguments
that
were
made.
now,
first
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked,
“did
the
board
change
the
criteria?
when
did
the
board
change
the
criteria
applicable
to
this
case?”
now
as
a
matter
of
the
fact,
so
far
as
--
as
we
read
the
brief
of
the
board,
those
criteria
have
been
enunciated
for
the
first
time
in
the
brief
of
the
board
to
this
court,
it
was
only
in
the
brief,
in
that
brief
that
there
was
any
enunciation
of
the
principle
which
the
board
now
think
--
think
should
be
applied,
namely,
the
duration
test.
that
is
never,
prior
to
this
case,
been
applied,
certainly,
never
considered
by
any
other
court
in
any
case
prior
to
this
one.
in
the
board's
decision,
the
question
was
related
simply
to
the
exclusiveness
of
the
use
of
this
gate
and
the
oral
appeals
at
this
gate.
now,
in
--
in
the
argument
to
this
court,
the
board
is
now
--
has
set
aside
the
question
of
the
exclusive
gate,
as
the
board
itself
did
in
cases
which
came
up
after
this
one.
and
it
says
merely
that
the
link
that
if
the
service
of
the
--
of
the
independent
contractors
was
regular
and
permanent,
then
the
picketing
at
--
the
picketing
of
those
employees
--
of
the
independent
contractors
would
be
of
a
secondary
nature,
relating
the
entire
matter
to
the
duration
of
employment.
now,
we
say
there's
absolutely
no
warrant
in
any
of
the
--
the
legislative
history
nor
anything
that
this
court
has
said
to
justify
what
in
our
view
is
simply
administrative
legislation.
now,
the
impossibility
of
the
application
of
that
rule
to
the
--
is
shown
by
this
case
itself.
here,
we
have
a
dozen
contractors
or
six
of
them
actually
at
work.
one
of
them
had
been
on
the
premises
for
two
years
or
two
and
a
half
years,
one
of
them
had
been
on
the
premises
for
one
month,
others
have
been
for
periods
in
between.
what
constitutes
permanent
or
regular?
so
far
as
the
employees
are
concerned,
of
those
employees,
none
of
them,
perhaps
with
one
or
two
exceptions,
had
been
there
for
more
that
a
month
or
in
most
cases,
for
a
few
days.
so
this
--
this
principle
or
criteria
has
not
been
spelled
out
so
as
to
be
possible
at
all
of
applications.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
two,
two
criteria,
one,
the
fact
that
the
--
the
site
and
the
second
is
the
purpose
with
relation
to
the
whether
or
not
the
primary
employer
--
whether
the
secondary
employer
rather,
was
doing
work
for
the
primary
employer.
we
had
those
two
--
those
two
situations.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well
if
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
the
secondary
employer
is
away
from
the
--
entirely
away
from
the
site
and
certainly
that
would
not
fall
within
our
criteria
of
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
primary
picketing.
no.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
they're
not
in
itself
sufficient.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
not
in
itself,
no.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
with
the
combination
of
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
true.
but,
we're
--
that
is
only
one
of
the
two
essential
factors.
the
other
is
that
here,
the
--
as
--
as
here,
the
dispute
was
at
the
premises
of
the
primary
employer.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
because
the
--
the
question
comes
down
to
what
is
the
traditional
picketing,
what
is
the
purpose
with
relation
to
the
picketing?
now,
we
say
that
the
purpose
is
to
bring
pressure
on
the
primary
employer.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
by
traditional
and
permissible,
we
used
the
terms
as
this
court
used
it
in
rice
milling,
the
--
what
is
the
ordinary
--
what
was
done
in
the
ordinary
strike
at
the
time
the
taft-hartley
was
adopted?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
true
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but
generally
speaking
--
generally
speaking
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
this
court
indicated
what
it
considered
to
be
an
ordinary
strike
in
the
rice
milling
case,
by
referring
to
the
ryan
case
and
the
pure
oil
case.
it
referred
to
those
two
cases
of
the
board
as
being
illustrations
of
primary
--
of
the
traditional
and
permissible
type
of
picketing.
now,
while
the
--
of
course,
the
--
there
are
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
there
were.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
where
there
is
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
true
the
--
there
was
no
precise
definition.
but
it
is
clear
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
was
considering
and
this
court
pointed
out
to
the
fact
that
congress
did
consider
the
--
the
distinctions
between
primary
and
secondary
boycott.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
now,
of
course,
in
the
1959
amendments,
the
--
the
congress
did
make
specific
reference
to
preserve
--
preservation
of
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing.
now,
of
course
didn't
define
them.
that's
true,
but
of
course
the
--
the
implication
was
certainly
that
they
were
preserving
and
making
sure
there
was
no
interference
with
those
as
distinguished
from
what
would
constitute
secondary
picketing
and
secondary
strikes.
now,
may
i
point
out
there
are
some
other
amendments
in
the
act
which
illuminate
if
they
do
not
--
do
not
control
on
this
question.
now,
if
the
--
if
congress
had
intended
to
prohibit
the
type
of
picketing,
the
appeals
to
third
parties
as
the
board
would
want
the
courts
to
do
in
this
case.
they
could
--
would
certainly
have
said
so
because
they
did
say
so
with
reference
to
other
sections
of
the
amendments
as
they
were
adopted
in
1959.
now,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
question
that
this
proviso
appears
in
8
(b)
(4)
as
adopted
in
1959
additional
amendments
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
i'm
reading
from
the
act.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
i
think
there
was
(inaudible)
of
quotation
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
here.
i
--
they're
not
actually
quoted.
these
amendments
are
not
quoted
in
our
brief,
but
they
are
quoted
in
the
amicus
brief,
page
--
page
through
--
beginning
at
page
30
and
going
over
to
33.
at
the
bottom
of
page
33,
he
noted
the
brief
from
that.
that
at
the
end
8
(b)
(4),
the
--
there
is
a
provision
protecting
a
union's
right
to
publicize
the
fact
that
one
or
more
employers
are
handling
or
selling
products
of
another
employer
with
whom
there
is
a
labor
dispute.
that
provides
us
--
though
specifically
provides,
however,
and
with
the
right
to
publicize
that
fact
exists
only,
“as
long
as
such
publicity
does
not
have
an
effect
of
inducing
any
individual
employed
by
any
person
other
than
the
primary
employer
in
the
course
of
his
employment
to
pick
up,
deliver
or
transport
any
good
or
not
perform
any
services
at
the
establishment
of
the
employer
engaged
in
such
distribution.”
now,
we
submit
that
if
congress
had
intended
any
such
limitation
to
apply
and
this
is
the
type
of
limitation
that
in
fact,
that
the
board
here
wants.
it
would
certainly
have
said
so
in
the
very
section
which
is
involved
here.
now,
another
--
a
similar
proviso
appears
in
section
8
(b)
(7),
which
deals
with
organizational
or
a
recognition
picketing.
and
there
says
that
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
informing
the
public
that
is
protected,
unless
any
effect
of
such
picketing
is
to
induce
any
individual
employed
by
any
other
person
in
the
course
of
employ
--
employment,
not
to
pick
up,
transport
or
perform
services.
so
that
so
far
as
the
legislation
is
concerned,
so
far
as
the
amendments
are
concerned,
whatever
affect
they
may
have
certainly
support
the
petitioner's
position.
and
that
--
and
we
submit
that
that
position
of
course
is
strongly
supported
by
--
in
other
ways
as
well
by
this
court.
now,
getting
back
to
the
question
of
this
criterion,
this
new
criterion
which
the
board
wants
to
apply,
i
think
a
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
as
to
what
would
happen
in
the
rice
milling
case
under
this
new
criterion.
and
i
think
the
answer
was
that
if
there
were
a
separate
gate
and
the
kaplan
employees
had
gone
--
had
been
stopped
at
that
gate,
that
would
had
been
illegal
if
there
had
been
other
contractors
on
the
premises.
i
think
that
was
the
answer.
so
that
this
is
a
new
wrinkle
in
this
criterion
which
doesn't
appear
before,
that
is
if
there
is
only
one
independent
contractor
on
the
premises
for
a
regular
period
of
time.
it's
not
illegal
if
i
understood
counsel,
whether
there
are
two
or
more
contractors,
not
employees,
if
there
are
two
more
contractors
on
the
premises
it
becomes
illegal.
we
submit
this
is
--
this
is
sheer
anarchy.
it
will
be
impossible
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
which
justifies
the
--
that
kind
of
interpretation.
now,
so
far
as
geography
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
i
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
i
--
i
--
we've
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
but
there
were
certain
guidelines,
your
honor,
as
shown
by
the
material
legislative
history.
now,
we
--
we
simply
have
to
refer
to
that
and
we've
discussed
that
at
length
in
our
briefs.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
just
one
more
point.
board
counsel
suggests
that
originally,
the
criteria
was
--
were
--
was
geography
alone.
now,
i
submit
that
that
was
not
the
situation
because
if
geography
alone
was
the
criterion,
then
the
denver
case
would
have
been
decided
the
other
way
because
then,
all
the
employees
were
right
on
the
same
premises.
likewise
the
moore
dry
dock
case,
which
was
mentioned
by
counsel,
would
have
been
decided
the
other
way
because
the
--
the
both
employees
were
on
the
same
premises.
so
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
they
did
not
have
to
change
their
position
in
order
to
conform
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
rice
milling,
the
court
said
that
geography
was
significant,
but
not
controlling.
and
we
say
geography
is
significant,
but
not
controlling.
the
other
factor
is
that
the
secondary
employer
was
working
for
the
primary
employer
on
the
premises
of
the
primary
employer.
thank
you.
