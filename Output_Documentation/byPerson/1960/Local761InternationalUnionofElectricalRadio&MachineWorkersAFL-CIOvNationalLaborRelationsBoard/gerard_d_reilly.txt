mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
may
--
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner
is
relying
rather
heavily
here
on
a
concession
which
appears
in
the
board's
brief
in
which
mr.
come
has
adverted,
namely
that
if
you
read
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
literally,
it
would
seem
to
ban
all
primary
strikes.
now,
i
submit
that
even
though
that
observation
was
taken
from
opinion
of
judge
and
the
later
opinion
by
judge
hand,
that
that's
not
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
granted
that
the
draftsmanship
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
may
have
practically
it
would
be
desired.
i
still
think
that
is
a
rather
strained
and
almost
a
perverse
interpretation
of
section
an
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
to
say
that
it
would
--
prepared
primary
strikes
unless
tested
out
in
this
case.
if
one
should
ask
the
employees
surveying
this
construction
companies
why
they
were
striking,
they
probably
would
have
said
they
didn't
want
--
they
wanted
their
employer
to
stop
doing
any
work
for
general
electric
during
the
strike
or
if
should
asked
any
of
the
general
electric
employees
why
they
were
striking,
i
doubt
very
much
that
anyone
of
--
any
of
them
would've
said,
“well,
we
want
general
electric
to
cease
doing
business
with
everybody.”
they
probably
would
have
said,
“we
want
to
general
electric
to
remedy
our
grievances
or
give
us
better
contracts.”
something
of
that
sort,
so
i
think
it's
--
that
to
give
the
statute
its
literal
meaning
which
is
what
the
court
below
did,
that
is
positive
of
the
case
because
the
court
below
said
“it's
the
intent
that
counts.”
and
here
of
course,
the
intent
of
the
union
is
pinpointed
by
the
fact
that
they
selected
this
segregated
gate
for
picketing.
and
--
and
as
further
shown
by
the
fact
that
if
this
conference
--
while
the
picketing
was
going
on
and
when
the
representative
of
this
building
trades
unions
attended
the
conference,
the
leader
for
petitioner's
union
pointed
out
that
they
had
a
picket
line
there
and
--
and
he
didn't
want
any
of
these
construction
workers
to
cross
it.
so
there's
no
doubt
as
to
the
intent
here
and
i
think
that's
really
dispositive
of
the
case
and
would
avoid
getting
into
all
these
complications
of
situs
and
common
situs
and
roving
situs
which
mr.
come
has
had
to
advert
to.
it's
a
--
it's
rather
strange
if
this
section
could
be
construed
as
prohibiting
primary
strikes
that
neither
senator
pepper
or
senator
morse
for
the
principal
opponents
of
the
taft-hartley
--
of
building
the
committee
and
who
played
a
large
part
in
the
drafting
of
the
minority
report
and
spoke
extensively
against
section
8
(b)
(4)
on
the
floor,
that
never
occurred
to
them.
they
objected
to
section
8
(b)
(4)
and
that
they
call
it
--
went
further
than
to
prohibit
what
economic
writers
spoke
of
as
a
secondary
boycott.
and
they
would
have
limited
a
secondary
boycott
to
situations
where
the
employees
were
not
working
on
the
same
premises
or
where
there
wasn't
so
much
unity
of
action
or
whether
the
strike
was
for
an
illegal
objective.
the
petitioner's
brief
relies
rather
heavily
upon
some
remarks
of
senator
taft
which
were
taken
out
of
context
in
which
he
said
that
his
bill
was
not
intended
to
prevent
people
from
striking
over
wages
now
as
in
other
working
conditions
under
--
engaged
picketing
on
them.
and
when
senator
taft
made
those
remarks,
he
was
not
saying
this
because
he
felt
that
some
people
on
the
floor
believed
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
was
prohibiting
a
primary
strike.
quite
the
contrary,
what
he
was
doing
was
defending
the
bill
on
the
ground
which
was
perfectly
obvious
to
anyone
reading
it
that
it
didn't
go
so
far
as
to
prohibit
striking.
they
remembered
that
that
legislation
was
written
during
the
period
of
the
great
wave
of
post-war
strikes
which
succeeded
a
period
of
government
regulation
of
wages
and
prices
in
which
there
hadn't
been
a
--
strikes
had
been
illegal.
and
--
and
there
was
this
certain
amount
of
public
sentiment
for
going
back
to
that
situation.
so
when
senator
taft
made
the
remarks
which
quoted
in
petitioner's
brief,
he
preceded
them
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
1107
of
volume
2
of
the
legislative
history,
“we
have
considered
the
question
whether
the
right
to
strike
can
be
modified.
i
think
it
can
be
modified
in
cases
which
do
not
involve
the
basic
question
of
wages,
prices
and
working
conditions,
but
if
we
impose
compulsory
arbitration
or
if
we
give
the
government
power
to
fix
wages
in
which
men
must
work
for
another
year
or
for
two
years
to
come,
i
do
not
see
how
in
the
end
we
can
escape
a
collective
economy.
we
give
the
government
power
to
fix
wages.
i
do
not
see
how
we
can
take
from
the
government
the
power
to
fix
prices
and
so
forth.”
now,
one
thing
of
course
that
gives
petitioner's
arguments
a
certain
amount
of
support
was
that
there
was
a
period
shortly
after
taft-hartley
act
passed
in
which
the
board,
not
looking
at
the
full
legislative
history,
not
doing
any
research
apparently
upon
the
evolution
of
the
senate
committee
bill
from
s55
into
the
taft-hartley
act.
these
say
some
of
the
things
that
mr.
sigal
is
saying
here
today.
but
i
submit
your
honors
that
the
ryan
construction
company
case
falls
into
that
same
class
of
cases
like
the
lock-out
cases,
communist
disclaimer
cases,
the
hot
cargo
cases
and
the
professional
employee
cases.
cases
in
which
in
the
early
period
of
the
act,
the
board
was
not
giving
the
statute
its
--
its
plain
meaning
and
a
result,
this
court
had
occasionally
reverse
the
board
in
all
four
of
those
cases.
and
now
the
shift
of
the
board's
position
from
the
ryan
case
to
this
general
electric
case
wasn't
a
judgment
of
board
expertise.
section
8
(b)
(4)
is
identical
to
section
303
which
is
a
section
of
course
which
could
come
up
in
the
district
courts
and
reached
this
court
and
review
that
way.
so
what
we
really
have
here
is
not
a
question
of
expertise,
it's
a
question
of
statutory
construction.
now,
mr.
sigal
has
conceded
that
if
he's
correct
in
his
position,
this
could
also
apply
to
a
secondary
--
to
a
--
this
type
of
picketing
in
a
strike
for
recognition.
strike
for
recognition
of
--
prior
to
the
landrum-griffin
act
at
least,
were
lawful
as
this
court
found
in
the
curtis
case.
now,
in
the
--
senator
ball,
one
of
the
managers
of
the
taft-hartley
bill
in
the
senate
floor
refers
to
--
and
this
is
mentioned
on
page
29
of
our
brief.
he
refers
to
a
situation
in
which
a
picket
line
was
formed
around
the
premises
of
a
non-union
employer.
and
thereby
sends
--
his
supplies
were
chopped-off,
the
men
were
forced
to
enter
the
union.
and
he
was
referring
to
this
as
--
as
in
connection
with
his
proposed
amendments
which
resulted
in
the
adoption
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
which
this
court
construed
in
curtis.
apparently,
the
court
construed
it
correctly
in
curtis
because
senator
ball
said
that
another
section
of
this
bill
--
and
of
course
he
must
have
meant
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
the
very
question
here,
deals
with
this
situation.
so
that
here,
if
we
apply
the
obvious
congressional
intent,
it's
--
it
would
seem
that
any
picketing
directed
at
--
at
shutting
off
suppliers
and
costumers
--
as
to
the
employers
and
costumers,
which
would
be
prohibited
by
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
i
want
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
in
every
primary
strike
if
there's
a
picket
line
and
some
odd
suppliers
don't
come
in,
that
that
is
necessarily
a
violation
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a).
i
would
say
that's
possibly
a
windfall
that
the
primary
strikers
have.
but
--
but
where
the
pickets
were
out
of
location,
where
it's
perfectly
clear
that
their
impact
is
simply
upon
the
employers
or
secondary
employers,
whether
those
employers
are
resident
employers
on
the
premises
like
this
contractors
or
whether
they're
simple
employers
of
trucking
companies
who,
coming
in
to
make
regular
deliveries
and
pickups,
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
clear
that
that's
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(a).
now,
there's
nothing
inconsistent
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out
between
this
position
and
what
--
on
the
conclusion
this
court
reached
in
the
rice
milling
case.
remember
the
--
at
some
point
of
the
main
petitioner's
brief
that
there
were
two
people
involved
in
this,
but
one
of
them
was
just
a
passenger
or
a
helper
on
the
truck,
so
that
you
couldn't
say
the
two
men
were
leaving
in
concert
because
by
the
very
physical
location
of
the
helper,
he
had
to
leave
when
the
driver
left.
now,
what
that
case
was
about
was
a
--
it
was
concerned
with
a
picket
line
on
a
railroad
site
in
which
they're
certainly
concerted
activity,
certainly
an
encouragement
of
concerted
activity
there.and
this
particular
plant,
the
kaplan
mill,
was
primarily
supplied
by
rail.
the
board
in
its
original
decision
had
held
that
the
picketing
at
the
railroad
site
was
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
a
railroad
was
not
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
board
on
that
as
well
as
the
board's
situs
doctrine
on
the
truck
driver.
but
when
it
reached
this
court,
the
board
did
not
apply
for
certiorari
on
that.
in
effect,
a
confessing
error,
let
the
decision
of
the
circuit
stand
so
that
all
that
was
before
this
court
was
this
rather
odd
incident
of
--
isolated
incident
since
the
whole
thrust
of
the
picketing
was
at
the
railroad
of
the
pickets
suddenly
move
--
moving
over
it
and
attacking
this
single
truck.
the
point
has
been
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
new
legislation
has
any
bearing
on
this
case.
it
--
it
is
a
question
which
the
court
i
think,
must
consider
to
this
degree.
since
this
order
or
decree
or
the
court
below
operates
respectively,
if
the
new
legislation
had
harshly
repealed
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a),
then
conceivably,
the
order
should
be
modified.
mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
i
--
i
think
that
it
makes
this
case
a
stronger
case
for
the
position
of
the
court
below
because
one
of
the
cases
which
is
cited
has
a
limitation
which
the
--
well,
if
there
--
there
are
two
case
that
is
cited.
they're
four
in
all,
but
--
mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
in
the
report,
but
they're
two
cases
which
have
a
great
deal
bearing
here.
one
of
them
is
the
denver
building
construction
trades
case
which
of
course
was
a
case
involving
the
same
premises.
the
other
is
the
moore
dry
dock
case.
now
the
--
one
of
the
limitations
in
moore
dry
dock
--
that
was
a
case
which
the
board
is
also
relying
on
as
a
common
situs
case.
they
recalled
a
primary
strike,
was
a
strike
on
a
ship
which
was
in
the
dry
dock
for
repairs.
the
--
when
the
seamen
union
came
around
to
picket
in
aid
of
their
strike,
the
owners
of
the
ship
and
the
owners
of
the
--
wouldn't
let
them
come
up
to
the
place
where
the
ship
was
moore.
so
they
had
to
picket
outside
the
dry
dock.
the
effect
of
their
picketing
was
to
cause
a
number
of
the
ship
building
employees
and
not
to
cross
that
picket
line,
employees
of
another
employer.
the
board
in
that
case
said
that
it
was
not
holding
that
to
be
an
illegal
inducement
because
the
strike
which
was
called
on
the
ship
was
a
lawful
primary
strike.
and
these
strikers
or
pickets
were
not
permitted
by
management
to
approach
the
(inaudible)
and
as
to
limit
their
picketing
to
the
place
where
the
actual
dispute
was
occurring
between
the
ship
master
and
the
crew.
and
--
but
here,
in
contrast
to
them,
this
picket
line
could
have
been
limited
to
the
entrances
frequented
by
the
employees
of
the
struck
employer.
and
if
it's
not
--
so
there,
i
would
say
that
under
the
legislative
history,
it's
crystal
clear
that
congress
intended
that's
--
the
situation
here
was
illegal.
i
also
think
that
for
this
reason,
the
house
conference
report
is
--
is
very
(inaudible).
but
as
--
it's
prefaced
by
the
remarks
that
congress
didn't
intend
once
they
put
in
this
proviso
about
picketing,
permitting
primary
strikes
and
primary
picketing
to
change
the
existing
law
or
rule
to
the
decision,
allowing
that
--
limiting
it
when
they
gave
this
case,
illustrative.
now,
this
particular
case
and
another
case
in
which
--
an
earlier
case,
this
crystal
palace
case
in
which
ryan
and
fishman
(ph)
overruled
or
limited,
had
received
very
wide
publicity
in
the
weekly
labor
relations
report,
at
which
the
kind
of
a
bible
of
the
most
lawyers
and
--
and
congressional
staff
people
who
work
in
this
field.
so
that
is
extremely
unlikely
that
professor
cox
who
was
running
the
--
was
negotiating
of
what
was
on
the
house
conference
report
in
the
senate
with
mr.
ryan,
the
able
and
experienced
house
counsel,
were
unaware
of
--
of
this
case.
mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
thus
--
mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
yes.
mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
yes,
it
throws
no
light
upon
--
upon
a
situation
where
the
intent
of
the
picketing,
it's
primary
site
is
really
directed
at
employees
of
secondaries.
mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
i
know
that
it
is
rather
--
mr.
gerard
d.
reilly
yes.
