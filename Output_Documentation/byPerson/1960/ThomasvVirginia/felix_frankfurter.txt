justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
doherty,
when
you
say
it's
physical,
what
about
a
--
a
note
of
an
individual,
if
i
hold
them
in
a
safe
deposit
box,
notes
of
jp
morgan,
whether
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
would
you
say
to
that?
that's
said
to
be
physical
--
if
it's
--
if
it
has
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
technicality
of
loan
in
the
past.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
so
is
a
federal
reserve
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
everybody,
if
passes
for
currency
because
everybody
thinks
(inaudible)
--
that
you
can
get
hard
coins
for
this
unique
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
i
want
to
know
is,
if
a
note
of
--
of
morgan
is
a
--
is
--
shows
in
action,
why
didn't
the
federal
reserve
know
that
shows
in
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
lawyer
to
another
â€“
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
highest
denominations
of
a
federal
reserve
note?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
i
thought.
now,
suppose
i
--
i
have
a
--
a
$10,000
federal
reserve
note
and
by
mistake,
i
throw
it
into
the
fire?
is
there
no
means
by
which
i
can
get
from
the
united
states
the
restoration
of
that
amount?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
way
the
postal
order?
what
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
past
is
current,
that's
the
only
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
talking
about
at
the
uncle
sam,
not
the
western
union.
suppose
i
have
a
--
can't
i
get
a
postal
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
postal
money
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
silver
note,
how
about
a
silver
note?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
it
be
always
a
gold
note?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
we
(inaudible)
a
note
for
morgan's
and
just
get
dollars
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
it
--
i
--
i
asked
you
whether
it
--
i
carelessly
lose
a
$5000
or
$10,000
federal
reserve
note,
it
isn't
gone
if
i
can
make
the
appropriate
proof
to
the
secretary
of
treasury,
i'll
get
another
one
instead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
just
sold
$10,000
note
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
thought
i
would
be
in
no
worse
financial
condition
(inaudible)
the
last,
he
loses
in
gambling,
could
it
to
get
it
back
from
the
secretary
of
treasury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
profitable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
statute
on
that
subject,
mr.
doherty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
(inaudible)
to
protect
them
from
some
except
difficulties
of
proof?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
think,
the
nature
of
the
thing
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
currencies
--
i
mean,
will
you
use
this
as
legal
tender
and
all
the
rest
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
the
real
--
the
real
nub
of
this
case,
if
you
agree
was
wether,
we
should
assimilate
reserve
notes
of
--
to
paintings
and
furnishing
a
brief
case
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
like
--
more
like
he
chose
in
that
--
to
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
the
quick
doctrine
as
mr.
justice
holmes,
pointed
out
in
union
transit
company,
was
--
that
the
(inaudible)
wasn't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
we
shouldn't
--
that
i
don't
accept
it
wholeheartedly,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
was
a
real
deviation
for
what
the
(inaudible)
was
supposed
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
be
the
relation
of
the
domiciliary
state
to
be
a
state
of
executor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
there
might
be
a
difference
between
--
on
justice
harlan's
assumption,
there
might
be
a
difference
in
the
ruling
of
this
court
as
to
the
nature
--
as
to
the
legal
nature
of
the
reserve
note,
when
this
action
was
made,
would
that
(inaudible)
with
the
united
states
by
something
that
this
is
part
of
the
united
states.
it
makes
it
--
i
was
thinking,
difference
might
be
made
as
between
two
states
and
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
prefer
to
have
it
--
do
you
prefer
to
have
travel
a
different
route?
justice
felix
frankfurter
without
an
eccentric
situation
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
i
don't
mean
a
legal
question,
but
the
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
you
--
you
don't
have
one
--
whatever
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
government
notes,
you
mean
treasury
notes
issued
for
a
short
period
in
anticipation
of
revenue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
the
treasury
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
treasury
notes
negotiable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
differentiation
should
be
made
with
reference
to
the
frick
doctrine
as
to
whether
their
notes,
that
the
all
gold
notes,
a
federal
reserve
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they're
all
are
choses
in
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
continental?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
have
another
historic
illustration
to
that
point,
if
that
was
valid,
namely
if
sanctioned
by
the
national
government
of
the
state
or
state
issues,
(inaudible)
a
great
historic
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcilwaine,
now,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
the
blodgett,
(inaudible)
that
chief
justice
taft
a
paragraph
that
you
regarded
not
helpful
to
the
(inaudible).
there
was
a
small
amount
of
cash
$287.48,
that's
what
the
choosing
was
about
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
small
amount
of
cash
$287.48,
now
from
hereon,
i
get
--
i'm
not
clear
--
i
do
like
--
in
bank
notes
and
coins
and
later
on,
it
was
on
towards
end,
but
we
think
that
money
--
the
words,
bank
notes,
the
phrase,
bank
notes,
drops
out
in
the
rest
of
the
talk
is
about
money.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
i
go
to
the
record
and
look
at
the
computation
of
the
tax
commission
of
connecticut
at
exhibit
c,
aother
miscellaneous
property
of
new
york,
the
national
city
bank
of
new
york
savings
account,
with
accrued
interest
of
$108.56,
the
life
insurance
policy,
cash
on
hand
at
new
york
$287.48.
what
i'd
like
to
have
you
elucidate
for
me
(inaudible)
when
the
chief
justice
got
the
introduction
of
his
(inaudible)
in
bank
notes
and
coins,
what's
the
bank
notes
mean?
what
does
that
describe?
he
talks
about
money
and
the
--
the
inventory
cost
with
cash
on
hand.
now,
you
wouldn't
describe
a
bank
note
as
cash
ordinarily
to
the
tax
commissioner,
would
you,
cash
on
hand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
what
bank
notes
are
there?
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
(inaudible)
another
bank
or
the
(inaudible)
trust
company
or
bank
in
(voice
overlap).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
must
say
that
(voice
overlap)
i've
got
the
bank
notes
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
money
--
i
don't
think
you
call
a
bank
note,
money.
in
order
--
from
a
technical
speaking
and
certainly,
the
tax
commissioner
didn't
just
draw
the
cash
on
hand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
or
do
we
call
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
issuing
agency
or
cash?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
controversies
here,
in
cash.
justice
felix
frankfurter
cash
and
the
cash
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think,
i
can't
find
any,
any
other
appearance
of
this
bank
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
either
of
you
--
the
reference
to
the
connecticut
decision
and
the
blodgett?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
happen
to
have
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
778.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you
very
much.
