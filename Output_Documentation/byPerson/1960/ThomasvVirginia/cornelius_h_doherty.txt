certiorari
has
been
granted
in
this
case
to
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county
and
is
a
state
court
and
the
appeal,
but
we
do
not
have
the
appeal
as
a
matter
of
right
in
virginia
and
we
had
to
apply
it
for
an
appeal,
which
was
denied
and
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
now
the
facts
in
this
matter
are
brief
and
very
simple.
crandal
mackey
who
was
a
member
of
this
court
and
had
office
in
the
district
columbia
for
a
number
of
years
and
was
domiciled
in
virginia,
arlington
county
of
virginia,
died
in
march
of
1957
and
at
his
death,
they
found
that
he
had
some
$263,000
in
cash
currency,
united
states
currency
in
a
safe
deposit
box
in
the
district
of
columbia
in
his
name.
harry
r.
thomas,
who
was
the
executor
named
in
the
will,
was
appointed
his
executor
by
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county
and
thereafter
and
so
the
administration
was
taken
out
in
the
district
of
columbia.
it
was
necessary
to
do
that
in
order
to
take
care
of
certain
other
properties
in
addition
to
the
$263,000.
the
taxing
authorities
in
the
district
of
columbia
ruled
that
this
$263,000
among
the
other
things
that
were
in
were
a
part
of
the
estate
of
crandal
mackey
that
it
was
tangible
personal
property
and
that
it
was
taxable
in
the
district
of
columbia,
relying
entirely
upon
the
blodgett
case
which
definitely
made
that
statement
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
the
executor
paid
the
tax
that
was
due
to
the
district
of
columbia.
there
after
in
making
this
return
in
the
--
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
they
set
forth
these
various
facts
that
it
had
paid
or
they
had
paid
the
amount
of
money
due
on
this
$263,000
in
the
district
of
columbia,
on
the
ground
that
it
was
tangible
personal
property.
and
virginia
ruled
that
this
$263,000
was
intangible
personal
property
and
not
tangible
personal
property
and
therefore,
they
have
to
pay
the
tax
on
that
amount
of
money
in
the
--
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
an
application
was
made
by
the
executor
to
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county
on
the
basis
of
the
law
in
virginia
which
permits
you
to
ask
a
relief
from
such
an
assessment
and
in
that,
it
was
set
forth
that
the
charging
of
this
extra
tax
in
virginia
was
the
taking
of
--
of
property
without
due
process
of
law,
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
was
tangible
personal
property
and
that
virginia
did
not
have
the
right
to
tax
it.
judge
medley,
now
in
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county,
wrote
a
memorandum
opinion
and
the
judge
(inaudible)
stating
that
it
was
intangible
personal
property
and
assessed
the
tax
as
against
the
estate.
now,
the
only
real
question
we
have
here
is
whether
or
not,
this
money
is
tangible
personal
property
or
whether
it's
intangible
personal
property.
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
question
or
whatever
raised
about
the
law
as
to
where
the
tax
should
be
paid,
in
the
event
that
it's
intangible
personal
property.
but
if
its
tangible
personal
property,
it
should
be
taxed
at
the
situs,
which
in
this
particular
case,
would
be
the
district
of
columbia.
intangible
personal
property
as
referred
to
in
the
mckinley's
case,
the
one
of
the
cases
cited
in
both
our
briefs,
makes
this
statement,
"the
very
different
considerations
both
theoretically
--
theoretical
and
practical,
applied
in
the
taxation
of
intangibles,
that
is
rights
which
are
not
related
to
physical
things.
such
rights
are
but
relationships
between
persons,
natural
or
corporate,
which
the
law
recognizes
by
attaching
to
them
certain
sanctions
enforceable
in
courts,
like
a
certificate
of
stock.
no
matter
what
happens
to
that
certificate
of
stock,
you
may
lose
it,
someone
may
steal
it,
anything
may
happen
and
you
only
--
you
have
a
right
then
to
go
to
the
corporation
and
say,
"well,
that
certificate
was
lost.
it
was
stolen
or
something.
i
want
a
new
one."
now,
--
and
in
the
ordinary
course
of
time,
normal
course
of
time,
you
will
get
another
one
and
that's
true
of
anything
that's
be
--
just
an
evidence
of
a
debt.
you
have
the
right
to
go
into
court
and
to
ask
the
court
under
those
circumstances
to
give
you
a
judgment
or
whatever
the
particular
facts
may
be.
now
in
the
question
of
tangible
personal
property,
it's
contended
of
course
and
very
definitely
by
the
petitioner
that
currency,
united
states
currency
is
a
tangible
--
is
tangible
property.
i
can't
conceive
of
anything
that
is
more
tangible
than
a
$10
bill.
it
maybe
(inaudible)
certificate
or
gold
certificate
or
maybe
for
the
different
bank
or
from
any
particular
part
of
the
country,
once
you
get
that,
the
normal
person
never
looks
at
this
certificate.
he
doesn't
know
whether
the
certificate
or
what
it
maybe.
he
knows
he
can
get
two
$5
bills
of
that
$10
or
he
can
get
ten
$1s
for
it,
but
it's
right
there
and
present.
it's
something
that
can
be
felt.
it's
a
physical
thing.
you
can't
lose
that
or
go
out
and
spend
it
or
gamble
it
away
and
then
go
down
to
the
united
states
treasury
and
say,
"well,
this
is
just
evidence
of
a
certain
obligation
of
the
treasury.
we
want
a
new
$10
bill
or
a
$100
bill,
whatever
the
thing
maybe."
the
thing
itself
is
just
what
it
is.
the
property
or
physical
thing
is
the
$100
or
$10
bill
that
you
have
in
your
hand.
and
when
that's
gone,
everything
is
gone.
you
have
no
way
in
this
world
to
show
any
evidence
to
anybody
at
any
time.
now
the
commonwealth
contends
rather
definitely
that
this
is
intangible.
now,
we
have
this
blodgett
case,
which
is
referred
to
both
by
the
commonwealth
and
the
petitioner
and
in
that
blodgett
case,
there
were
a
number
of
issues
that
came
before
this
court,
that
came
out
from
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
connecticut.
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
certain
stocks
and
bonds
that
were
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
in
the
name
of
the
individual
who
is
domiciled
in
connecticut
and
also
there
was
this
$287.48
that
was
in
the
safe
deposit
box.
there's
nothing
said
in
there
by
it
was,
other
than
it
was
a
small
amount
of
cash,
$287.48.
and
the
--
it
was
contended
in
this
court
by
the
state
of
connecticut
that
that
was
intangible
personal
property,
but
the
court
said
and
i'm
bringing
down
on
page
6
on
my
brief
down
near
the
end
of
the
citation,
but
we
think
that
money
so
definitely
fixed
and
separated
in
its
actual
situs
from
the
person
of
the
owner
as
this
was
one
is
tangible
property
and
cannot
be
distinguished
from
the
paintings
and
furniture
held
on
the
frick
case
to
be
taxable
only
the
jurisdiction
where
they
were.
now
this
$263,000
isn't
like
money
in
the
bank.
it
would
--
$263,000
which
put
in
the
bank,
then
it
becomes
intangible
personal
property
because
all
you
have
then
is
a
right
to
insist
that
that
bank
pay
over
some
time
$263,000,
but
this
money
was
actually
in
the
possession
and
under
the
control
of
crandal
mackey
until
he
died
and
the
district
of
columbia,
with
their
assessor
or
the
register
of
wills,
went
up
there
to
open
the
safe
deposit
box
and
it
was
opened
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
commonwealth
says
this
in
its
brief
on
page
7,
"the
language
of
this
court,
speaking
about
the
blodgett
case,
quoted
immediately
above,
constitutes
the
sole
support
of
the
petitioner's
position
in
the
case
at
bar.
were
it
not
for
this
language,
the
instant
case
would
not
have
arisen.
it
would
therefore,
seem
appropriate
who
analyzes
isolated
paragraph
in
as
much
detail
as
it
its
mere
contents
will
permit.
now,
there
was
no
--
any
reason
to
say
anything
more
than
that
and
it
set
forth
this
fact.
it
was
one
issue
that
would
be
for
this
court
and
the
question
was,
was
this
money
in
the
safe
deposit
box?
this
cash
whatever
it
maybe,
in
the
safe
deposit
box
tangible
personal
property
or
intangible
personal
property?
they
just
say
its
money.
that's
the
way
we
always
look
at
it,
it's
money.
there's
nothing
else
there
--
as
a
--
it's
the
same
as
a
diamond
ring
or
a
watch
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
cannot
be
conceived
to
be
as
the
commonwealth
contents,
intangible
personal
property.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
i
--
i
would
say,
they're
both
the
same
thing
as
the
court
--
as
this
court
said
in
the
norwich
case
which
i
referred
to
on
page
12
of
my
brief.
it
says,
gold
certificates,
this
is
a
case
where
this
man
had
some
$106,000
when
the
united
states
went
off
the
gold
standard
and
he
asked
for
a
$106,000
in
gold
pieces
which
they
refused
to
give
it
to
him.
they
gave
him
a
$106,000
in
just
ordinary
bills
and
he
filed
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
the
balance
with
$60,000
or
$70,000
which
was
the
increased
value
of
that
gold
from
the
time
that
he'd
originally
gotten
it
or
from
the
time
that
the
--
this
particular
certificate
was
issued.
and
the
court
said
this
--
this
court,
"gold
certificates
under
this
legislation
were
required
to
be
issued
in
denominations
of
dollars
and
called
to
the
payment
of
dollars."
these
gold
certificates
were
currency.
they
were
not
less
sold
because
the
specified
numbers
of
dollars
were
payable
in
gold
coin
or
the
coinage
of
the
united
states.
the
in
currency
and
constitute
legal
tender,
it
is
entirely
inadmissible
to
regard
the
gold
certificates
as
warehouse
receipt.
they
were
not
contracts
where
a
shortened
of
--
of
gold
as
a
commodity.
they
called
for
dollars
not
bullion.
so
that
--
the
main
thing
when
you
--
to
show
that
they're
intangible,
you
must
go
back
to
same
old
theory
and
that
is,
is
it
evidence
of
anything?
the
only
thing
is
it's
evidence
of
just
what
it
is,
it's
a
physical
thing
itself.
it
isn't
any
evidence
of
anything
else
rather
than
the
fact
that
you
can
take
that
$10
or
$100
and
go
out
and
do
whatever
you
want
with
it,
but
when
it's
gone,
it's
gone.
you
lose
it,
it's
gone.
if
it's
stolen,
it's
gone,
unless
you're
able
to
find
it.
there's
no
way
of
identifying
that
thing.
now,
the
commonwealth
relies
greatly
upon
justice
stone's
concurring
opinion
in
the
â€“
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
pearson
case,
yes,
sir
and
thank
you,
justice
clark.
in
that
case,
i
don't
see
why
justice
stone
was
so
perturbed
about
this
situation.
he
had
a
different
point
of
view
i'm
certain,
than
some
of
the
other
justices
that
sat
in
that
particular
case.
now,
justice
stone
was
in
the
blodgett
case
and
that
--
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
blodgett
case
which
said
very
definitely
that
this
money
in
the
safe
deposit
box
was
tangible
personal
property
and
was
taxable
in
new
york
and
not
in
connecticut.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
in
pearson
case,
this
was
the
--
where
a
man
in
oregon
had
a
deal
of
some
kind
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
trust
for
his
certain
members
of
his
family,
was
dealing
with
illinois
trust
company
and
that
illinois
trust
company
was
a
--
a
large
bank
in
the
city
of
chicago.
and
he
had
turned
over
--
over
a
period
of
time
and
certain
moneys
and
certain
stock
and
all
these
various
things
that
were
to
be
used
by
them
or
to
be
invested
as
they
saw
fit,
for
certain
purposes.
he
had
a
certain
amount
of
money
on
him
$68,000,
as
i
remember,
this
$450,000
in
--
on
deposit
in
the
bank.
and
he
directed
among
other
things
that
this
trust
company
was
to
sell
all
his
stocks
of
various
parts
also
that
he
would
have
eventually
get
$450,000
in
cash
and
that
he
was
to
--
they
would've
put
those
into
ordinary
dollars,
gold
certificates
or
currency,
whatever
it
might
be.
now,
whether
that
bank
was
supposed
to
hold
that
money
or
not,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that,
whether
it
was
to
be
taken
in
as
a
part
of
their
assets
in
the
bank
and
held
there.
it
was
--
as
i
look
at,
there
was
nothing
very
definitive
to
--
to
say
that
that
$450,000
should
be
kept
that
way.
but
nevertheless,
he
went
on,
the
bank
went
on
then
and
bought
various
other
stocks
and
investments
on
that
$450,000
and
thereafter
he
died.
now,
we
have
the
case
where
this
money
is
--
is
away
from
the
individual,
he's
--
he's
divested
his
--
any
right
that
he
has
to
it
--
that
is
from
a
physical
right.
he
can't
go
there
and
just
say
i
want
this.
the
only
thing
he
can
do
is
say,
well,
i
--
i'm
going
to
change
my
mind,
if
he
could,
before
this
trust
was
really
formed
and
i
want
my
money
back
and
they'll
send
him
a
check
for
the
amount
of
money
that
was
due.
under
those
circumstances,
he
had
just
the
right,
he
has
something
to
show
that
this
money
is
there
in
this
bank
in
chicago
and
he
can
demand
it
and
then
get
it
back
at
a
certain
time
or
up
to
--
he
divests
himself
of
that,
but
here
we
don't
have
that.
we
have
certainly
the
money
actually,
in
the
possession
of
the
individual.
it's
just
the
same
as
a
man
who
puts
money
in
the
bank,
it
commingles
with
something
else,
you
have
a
right
to
that,
you
can
sign
a
check
and
do
whatever
you
want
and
if
you
lose
your
bank,
well,
you
can
call
upon
them
immediately
and
they'll
send
you
another
one.
now,
in
this
statement
of
justice
stone,
the
court
didn't
go
along
with
him.
justice
frankfurter
did
go
along
to
a
certain
extent
with
what
justice
stone
did
say,
but
he
must
have
had
an
entirely
different
view
about
dollars
and
i
don't
think
he
was
talking
about
dollars
because
he
certainly
would
have
said
something
in
the
blodgett
case
if
he
wasn't
in
concurrence
with
the
statement
that
was
in
there
that
this
was
tangible
personal
property
and
taxable
where
it
was
in
the
safe
deposit
box,
but
in
this
pearson
versus
mcgraw,
the
court
--
this
court
said
that,
"therefore,
we
need
not
consider
the
nature
of
the
federal
reserve
notes
for
in
that
posture
of
the
case,
their
taxability
as
such
and
an
isolation
from
the
whole
transaction
is
not
an
issue.
there
was
no
issue
as
to
that
particular
thing
where
there
was
a
very
definite
issue
in
the
blodgett
case
and
they
passed
upon
it.
surely,
it's
in
a
small
paragraph,
but
you
don't
have
to
say
an
awful
lot
to
mean
those
things.
they
say,
the
commonwealth
contends
that
we
didn't
--
that
the
court
didn't
say
just
what
those
notes
meant
or
what
kind
of
notes
they
were
and
all
that.
they
said
it
was
money,
they
said
it
was
coins
and
they
said
it
was
dollars
or
whatever
it
may
be.
and
that
was
there
and
there's
nothing
to
indicate
anything
other
than
that.
i
submit
that
these
facts
are
so
claimed
that
this
money
and
we've
got
to
be
practical
about
the
thing
there.
there
isn't
anything
in
this
world
that
is
more
physical
and
more
subject
to
be
lost
or
stolen
or
gambled
or
anything
else
but
nevertheless,
once
it's
gone,
it's
gone
and
its
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
it
would
be
very
good,
i'd
say.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
it's
--
it's
physical.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
it's
physical
only
in
this
respect.
you
have
a
piece
of
paper
but
it
is
evidence
only
of
some
right,
in
some
corporation.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
no
it
doesn't
say
that.
the
notes
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well,
that's
true,
now
that's
what
--
that
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
to
the
only
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
because
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
is
this,
that
a
note
of
any
kind,
where
i
promise
to
pay
you
$10,000
at
such
and
such
a
time
and
for
some
reason
or
other,
you
lose
that
note.
you
can
always
prove
that
you
gave
me
$10,000
or
you
did
something
in
somewhere
or
other
and
you
could
go
into
court
and
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon.
and
as
i
said,
"and
the
intangible
thing
that
was
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
that
such
rise
are
but
relationships
between
persons,
natural
or
corporate,
which
the
law
recognizes
by
attaching
to
them
certain
sanctions
enforceable
in
court.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
i
think
it
is
$10,000,
if
not
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
if
your
honor
please,
if
there
was
any
way
to
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
a
postal
order
is
an
entirely
different
thing,
a
postal
order
you
mean,
the
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
yes,
but
you
--
when
you
get
that
order
on
the
western
union
or
the
postal
telegraph,
what
you
do
in
that
case
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
postal
money
order?
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
oh
yes,
you
can
always
go
back
to
uncle
sam
and
get
that
and
show
that
it
was
lost
and
give
them
the
number
and
everything
else,
you
have
one
part
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
a
silver
note?
you
can
current
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well,
that
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
about
it.
they
said
there's
not
a
warehouse
receipt,
it
just
calls
for
dollars
and
that's
what
they
gave
him
in
that
case
$106,000
and
just
ordinary
dollars.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
that's
all
you
get
for
it.
and
because
--
now,
i
have
a
case
before
this
court,
going
back
to
civil
war
i
think
was
a
--
the
willard
hotel
case,
i
haven't
read
it
in
a
long,
long
time,
but
there
was
something
there
that
they
insisted
that
they
were
--
should
pay
off
this
obligation
in
gold
and
the
court
said,
"no,
the
dollars."
this
was
legal
tender.
this
money
and
any
of
these
dollars
could
be
taken
to
pay
off
any
obligation
that's
due
private
or
public.
it
had
to
be
taken
by
that
but
this
$10,000
certificate
of
gold
or
bill
or
just
an
ordinary
bill
like
as
i
say,
i
never
thought
about
them
as
gold
certificates
or
anything
like
that.
it
was
something
that
i
could
take
out
and
buy
something
with
and
i
knew
that
the
minute
it
was
lost,
it
was
gone.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
the
only
thing
i
can
say
to
you,
justice
frankfurter,
is
this,
that
if
that
it
could
be
done,
there'd
be
such
a
line
out
there
in
front
of
that
treasury,
day
in
and
day
out
that
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well,
that
they
wouldn't
show
him.
they
(inaudible)
forget
about
them.
they
pass,
go
out
and
gamble
it
or
spend
it
or
something,
but
they'd
be
down
there.
there
are
plenty
of
people
to
be
down
there
--
down
before
that
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
secretary
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
--
well,
he
could
say
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
he
could
prove
that,
but
the
other
thing
is
something
that
--
that
goes
to
show
that
thing
is
just
--
that
itself
and
nothing
else.
it
isn't
there.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
i
--
i
would
think
so.
and
that's
thing
of
course
that
we're
up
against.
people
that
--
just
as
i
say,
i
didn't
think
anything
about
this
thing
other
--
until
this
case
came
up
and
i
thought
just
money
was
money
and
that
was
it.
i've
lost
a
pocketbook
or
something
like
that,
there
was
no
way
i
could
to
anybody
and
say,
"well,
i
lost
$300."
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
definitely,
there's
no
question
about
that.
that
--
that's
a
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
not
evidence
of
it.
yes,
your
honor.
i
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
is
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
folding
money.
yes
--
there's
a
lot
of
names
for
it,
but
it
all
adds
up
the
same
thing.
and
i
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
no,
your
honor.
there
is
--
that
this
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
no,
but
the
only
thing
that
have
a
regulation,
i
believe,
at
the
treasury
where
if
you
bring
a
note
that's
been
partially
destroyed
in
some
way
or
other
and
there's
enough
of
it
there
that
they
can
figure
out
that
it
couldn't
spend
the
other
part
of
it,
they'll
give
you
a
new
note
for
that.
they
have
in
fires
and
things
or
they
have
in
boxes
where
they
char.
but
they
have
somewhere
getting
at
it
and
they
can
get
a
number
and
something
like
that
and
they'll
give
you
something
for
that.
but
if
it's
tossed
in
the
wastebasket
and
the
maid
gets
it
or
some
other
person
gets
it,
that's
the
end
of
it,
in
so
far
as
the
owner.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
the
nature
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
it's
just
the
same.
as
i
look
at
it
if
you
have
a
--
a
ring,
it's
worth
a
certain
amount
of
money.
if
you
lose
it,
it's
gone
and
there's
no
way
you
can
do
it.
you
haven't
--
it
is
an
evidence
of
anything.
the
thing
itself
is
the
bill
or
that
particular
part
of
the
money
that
you
have
in
your
pocket
or
wherever
you
have
it.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
yes,
sir.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
yes,
that's
the
whole
question
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
in
pennies
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
no,
that's
true.
but
--
and,
and
in
the
--
the
blodgett
case,
they
didn't
question
the
fact
that
--
this
court
didn't
question
of
fact,
that
it
was
--
some
of
it
was
paper
money
and
i
assume
is
a
paper
money,
was
just
very
same
thing
as
we're
using
here
today.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
but
that's
true
and
i
would
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
i
would
hope
that
we
couldn't
gone
to
the
police
but
i,
i
don't
know.
they
feel
and
felt
that
rather
definitely
at
the
time
that
we
paid
this
money,
sincerely
believing
that
it
was
tangible
personal
property
and
that
they
thought
it
was
in
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
this
court
and
everybody
that
you
talked
to
says,
well,
it
is
money
and
that's
it,
it's
tangible.
i
--
i
can
answer
that
(inaudible)
to
say
that
i
hope,
if
we
didn't
--
or
the
two
lose
it
here,
that
we
could
get
it
back.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
i
don't
know
the
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
that,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
it's
something
for
this
court
to
decide.
i
--
i
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
yes
i
prefer
to
see
that
we
did
the
proper
thing
and
that
we
--
the
blodgett
case,
which
is
the
law
so
far
up
to
this
particular
time,
should
be
retained
as
the
law
of
the
land
that
people
rely
on
these
various
things,
time
and
time
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
no,
i
--
i
don't
go
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
it's
a
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
oh,
i
--
a
lot
of
people
do
it
just
like
this
manner
in
pearson
case,
he
had
$450,000.
i
don't
know
if
he
want
to
keep
those
in
dollars
or
what
i
don
t
know.
a
lot
of
people
do
that
as
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
them
who
has
done
it.
and
for
some
reason
or
other,
they
don't
want
to
trust
the
banks
time
and
time
again
the
--
or
they
bury
it
in
the
ground
or
something
like
that
which
would
be
similar
to
that.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
they
were
both
about
the
same.
i
think
the
--
the
district
was
a
little
bit
larger.
i
submit
that
if
it
please
the
court
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
that
that
is
the
action
of
the
circuit
court
of
arlington
county
should
be
reversed
and
that
we
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
if
it
were
in
fact
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
i
would
think
so
from
the
--
there
is
something
--
put
in
the
--
in
the
commonwealth's
brief.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
there's
something
in
there
in
which
they
referred
to
a
--
a
statute
or
--
of
virginia
which
says
that
money,
no
matter
where
it
is,
is
intangible
or
money
that
is
--
may
i
read
that
--
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
well
no,
they
don't.
no
that
they
say
money,
no
matter
where
it's
--
it
says
on
page
--
appellant's
brief
--
appellee's
brief,
on
page
2.
"money
in
the
possession
or
under
the
control
of
the
owner,
whether
such
money
be
actually
in
or
out
of
the
state
and
belonging
to
a
resident
of
this
state,
is
considered
to
be
taxable
in
virginia.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
that
--
that's
the
assumption
i
gather
from
the
commonwealth's
brief
in
this
case.
they
say
all
these
things
are
intangible
personal
property.
they're
declaring
something
and
of
course,
in
the
frick
case
and
--
and
a
couple
of
the
other
cases
that's
been
cited
in
the
brief,
they
say
very
definitely
that
it
is
the
situs
in
there
--
that
no
state
has
a
right
to
go
out
and
declare
that
certain
sums
of
money
or
anything
outside
of
their
jurisdiction,
a
place
where
they
--
their
courts
can't
control
it,
where
they
--
they
can't
go
out
and
levy
on
this
particular
money
or
whatever
it
maybe.
under
those
circumstances,
they
have
no
right
to
it.
that
is
the
situs
of
that
particular
piece
of
property
that
has
the
right
to
tax
and
only
that
state.
mr.
cornelius
h.
doherty
that's
right,
if
your
honor
please.
thank
you,
sir.
