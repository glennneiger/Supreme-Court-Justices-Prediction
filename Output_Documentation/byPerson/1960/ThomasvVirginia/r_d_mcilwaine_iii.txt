but
they
said
it
was
such
expansion
of
different
things
--
in
the
last
say,
50,
75,
100
years
that
--
where
people
move
into
one
jurisdiction
and
they
have
their
place
of
business
and
they
kept
certain
things
and
they
perhaps
as
today
have
a
plane
and
i'll
be
in
new
york,
one
minute
and
down
to
florida
and
some
other
place,
very
shortly
thereafter.
and
they
have
a
business
there
and
they
move
him
back
and
forth
and
in
one
of
those
circumstances,
they
have
to
take
that
which
is
at
the
situs
of
the
obligation
whatever
it
maybe.
mr.

mcilwaine
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
indicated
in
the
brief
on
behalf
of
respondent,
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
also
relies
to
a
significant
degree
upon
this
court's
decision
in
blodgett
versus
silberman,
for
the
support
of
the
commonwealth's
position
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
prohibits
virginia
from
imposing
an
inheritance
tax
upon
paper
money
owned
by
a
virginia
citizen
who
was
domiciled
in
virginia
at
the
time
of
his
death,
but
which
was
kept
in
a
safe
deposit
box
in
a
bank
in
the
district
of
columbia.
naturally,
we
would
prefer
that
the
terminal
paragraph
of
this
court's
decision
--
decision
in
blodgett,
had
not
been
written.
nevertheless,
we
feel
that
so
much
of
the
language
which
this
court
used
in
disposing
of
the
principal
question
in
that
case,
is
appropriate
to
the
specific
situation
presented
in
this
case
that
we
have
stressed
it
in
the
opening
pages
of
our
brief
particularly
pages
5
and
6.
in
the
blodgett
case,
this
court
reaffirmed
the
firmly
precedented
constitutional
principle
that
intangible
personal
property
belonging
to
a
decedent
domiciled
in
a
particular
state,
could
be
taxed
by
that
state
even
though
the
evidences
of
that
intangible
property
were
located
outside
of
the
state.
the
court
then
proceeded
to
consider
whether
or
not,
two
elements
of
the
hershey
state,
under
consideration
in
that
case,
constituted
tangible
personal
property
subject
to
the
frick
rule
or
intangible
personal
property
subject
to
the
rule
which
it
had
just
annunciated
or
which
had
just
reaffirmed.
insofar
as
the
hershey's
interest
in
a
partnership
in
new
york
was
concerned,
both
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
and
this
court,
held
that
that
was
intangible
personal
property
subject
to
taxation
by
connecticut,
the
state
in
which
mr.
hershey
was
domiciled
at
the
time
of
his
death.
however,
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
had
held
that
united
states
government
bonds
and
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness
constituted
tangible
personal
property
and
since
there
was
united
states
bonds
and
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness
were
situated
in
a
safe
deposit
box
in
a
bank
in
new
york
and
had
never
been
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
they
were
taxable
only
in
new
york.
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
admitted
in
its
decision
that
essentially
the
bonds
and
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness
were
choses
in
action.
however,
as
stated
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
said
that
since
these
bonds
are
negotiable,
since
they
pass
from
hand
to
hand
and
since
under
the
laws
of
some
states,
they
can
be
the
subject
of
attachment
and
they
maybe
the
subject
of
a
jurisdiction
of
certain
state
courts.
they
should
be
held
to
fall
under
the
frick
rule
and
not
to
be
different
from
the
furniture,
the
paintings,
the
rugs
and
the
firm
implements
under
consideration
in
the
frick
case.

your

the
silver
certificate
has
no
intrinsic
value,
but
it's
merely
representative
or
evidence
of
value.
i
can
take
the
silver
certificate
to
the
bank
and
get
a
silver
dollar
for
it.
and
the
silver
has
value
all
around
the
world,
but
i
can
--
if
i
take
a
silver
certificate
which
represents
an
obligation
of
a
government
to
pay
in
silver
dollar,
if
the
government
should
repudiate
that
obligation,
the
paper
is
worthless.
it
has
no
intrinsic
value.
i
cannot
take
money
which
the
united
states
government
has
repudiated
and
put
it
in
the
markets
of
the
world
as
having
value.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
understand
that
i
could
your
honor,
that
if
i
had
silver
dollars
or
gold
bullion,
i
could
also
that
it
would
have
value.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
the
paper
that
is
to
recognize
medium
of
exchange
of
the
government
is
so
because
of
the
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
pay
a
silver
dollar
or
the
silver
certificate
or
to
redeem
the
paper.
it
is
by
statute,
an
evidence
of
indebtedness
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
the
holder,
the
statute
so
makes
it.
and
we
have
set
those
statutes
out
on
page
12
and
13
of
our
brief.
federal
reserve

law

united

notes
by

also
constitute
obligations
of
the
united

in
the
amount
of
them
outstanding,
must
be
included
in
the
statement
of
the

u.s.c.a.

the

of

the
united

are
limited
number
of
paper
currency
your
honor,
which
are
issued
as
i
understand
it,
by
other
government
under
a
--
a
statute
which
was
in
existence
before
the
federal
reserve
act.
the
federal
reserve
act
established
various
banks
to
issue
money
under
the
control
of
the
board
of
governors,
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
its
notes
--
the
federal
reserve
notes
constitute
obligations
of
the
united
states
and
firstly
and
upon
the
assets
of
the
bank.
there
is
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
gold
reserve
maintained
behind
united
states
notes
and
the
gold
reserve
maintained
behind
the
federal
reserve
notes.
there
is
a
statutory
reserve
behind
the
united
states
notes
of
$150
million
in
gold
bullion.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
meant
in
this
connection,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
united
states
notes
and
federal
reserve
notes.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
currency,
yes,
sir.
there
are
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
i
think
they
would
just
represent
obligations
of
the
united
states
government
under
which
it
itself,
borrows
money.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
sir.
there
are
united
states
notes
presently
in
circulation
but
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
they
--
united
states
notes
are
in
denominations
of
$5,
$10
up
to
$100,
i
believe.
they
do
not
have
any
$1
or
$2
united
states
notes
or
any
of
the
larger.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
--
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
you
mean.
i've
always
understood
the
treasury
notes
and
treasury
bills,
all
of
the
government
paper
of
that
type,
60-day
bills
were
--
were
negotiable
including
various
issues
of
the
united
states
bonds.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
they
are
choses
in
action.
they
all
represent
something
of
value.
they
all
represent
a
promise
of
the
united
states
government
and
if
the
promise
behind
the
paper
is
withdrawn,
if
the
promise
behind
the
paper
is
abnegated,
if
the
government
of
united
states
should
fail
so
that
that
obligation
cannot
be
met
by
the
united
states
government,
the
paper
which
is
taxed
in
this
case,
is
utterly
worthless.
i
think
that
nothing
can
more
clearly
establish
the
representative
intangible
character
of
paper
money
than
the
idiom
which
everyone
has
heard
of
before,
confederate
money.
now,
up
until
(inaudible)
that
money
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
where
is
the
continental?
confederate
money
could
used
to
pay
taxes.
it
could
be
used
in
the
confederacy
during
the
war
to
purchase
land
and
the
things
necessary
to
--
for
existence,
so
long
as
the
federal
government
was
--
i
mean
the
confederate
government
was
in
existence
and
there
was
an
honor
or
an
honorable
obligation
by
the
confederacy
to
redeem
the
money
in
silver
or
gold
after
the
war.
now,
with
the
collapse
of
the
confederacy,
the
rags
on
the
floor,
the
land,
the
building,
the
silver
still
had
value
in
every
confederate
home,
but
the
paper
money
was
worthless.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
must
confess
ignorance
to
that
particular
matter,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
i
do
feel
that
any
contention
that
paper
money
is
something
real
and
tangible
because
it
is
kept
in
a
locked
box
misconceives
the
blodgett
doctrine
entirely
because
the
bonds
and
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness
in
blodgett
were
also
kept
in
a
locked
box
in
new
york
and
had
never
been
in
connecticut.
notwithstanding,
the
court
held
that
they
were
intangible
personal
property
and
that
they
were
subject
to
taxation
by
connecticut.
so
the
fact
that
this
paper
money
was
in
a
locked
box
is
not
going
to
change
its
character
of
intangible
personal
property
to
tangible
personal
property
and
if
paper
money
is
something
real
and
tangible
like
a
ring
or
a
piece
of
jewelry
as
suggested
by
the
petitioner,
the
question
arises
is
why
the
united
states
government
does
not
print
up
several
tons
of
it
and
deposit
it
in
the
vaults
at
fort
knox
and
then
cease
to
worry
about
the
current
drainage
on
the
gold
in
the
united
states.
if
it
is
something
real
and
tangible
like
a
piece
of
jewelry,
i
would
assume
that
it's
something
real
and
tangible
like
a
gold
ingot
or
a
bar
of
gold,
but
of
course,
it
isn't
real
and
tangible
like
that.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
if
they
were
any
gold
at
all
behind
the
original
issue
than
to
stop
the
printing
presses
would
have
the
effect
of
deluding
the
value
of
the
paper
currency
that
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
what
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
but
the
gold
would
be
tangible
and
the
paper
would
not
be,
your
honor.
if
the
paper
were
tangible,
it
would
do
service
for
gold.
if
there
is
any
validity
in
the
petitioner's
position
that
the
paper
money
in
this
locked
box
was
something
real
and
tangible
like
a
piece
of
jewelry
or
a
diamond,
that
the
value
was
associated
with
the
thing
itself,
then
why
would
it
not
do
service
for
something
that
is
tangible
or
something
that
the
common
law
admits
would
be
tangible,
that
is
gold.
we
also
of
course,
rely
upon
the
observations
of
mr.
justice
stone
in
pearson
versus
mcgraw.
we
think
that
there
was
really
no
consideration
of
the
nature
of
bank
notes
in
blodgett
versus
silberman.
the
court
said,
only
that
the
money,
the
$287.48
under
consideration
in
that
case,
was
comprised
of
bank
notes
and
coin.
thereafter,
it
noted
the
arguments
which
had
been
made
by
connecticut
in
which
it
was
argued
that
--
that
the
money
on
the
consideration
there
was
not
like
coin
or
treasure
in
the
vault,
but
was
like
loose
change,
so
to
speak.
and
then
the
court
said,
“we
think
that
money
so
definitely
fixed
and
separated
in
its
actual
situs
from
the
person,
the
owner
is
tangible
personal
property."
there
was
no
mention
made
of
bank
notes
after
initially
saying
that
the
small
amount
of
money
under
consideration
in
that
case,
was
comprised
of
bank
notes
and
coin.
thereafter,
we
submit,
the
court
considered
it
all
as
money
without
giving
consideration
to
the
statutory
character
of
paper
money.
and
we
feel
that
this
court's
observations
in
blodgett
versus
silberman
concerning
us
bonds
and
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness
are
precisely
on
point
with
united
states
paper
money.
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
our
brief,
we
set
out
what
this
court
said
about
u.s.
bonds
and
the
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness,
beginning
with
italicized
language
at
the
bottom
of
that
page.
the
court
said,
“we
think
bonds
are
not
thus
distinguishable
from
other
choses
in
action,”
that
is
simply
because
they
passed
them
from
hand
to
hand.
it
is
not
enough
to
show
that
the
written
or
printed
evidence
of
ownership,
made
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
they
are
physically
present,
be
permitted
to
be
taken
in
execution
or
dealt
with
as
reaching
that
of
in
which
they
are
evidenced
even
without
the
presence
of
the
owner.
while
bonds
often
are
so
treated,
they
are
nevertheless
in
their
essence
only
evidences
of
debt.
then
it
went
on
the
discussion
of
union
refrigerator
transit
company
case,
shows
what
this
court
meant
in
the
frick
case,
in
holding
that
personal
property
in
the
form
of
paintings
and
furniture,
having
an
actual
situs
in
one
state,
could
not
be
subjected
to
the
transfer
tax
in
another
state
and
emphasizes
the
inference
that
it
did
not
apply
to
anything
having
as
its
essence
and
indebtedness
or
a
chose
in
action
and
could
not
apply
to
property
in
the
form
of
specialties
or
bonds
or
other
written
evidences
of
indebtedness
whether
governmental
or
otherwise,
even
though
they
pass
from
hand
to
hand.
the
analogy
between
furniture
and
bonds
cannot
be
complete,
because
bonds
are
representative
only
and
are
not
the
thing
represented.
they
are
at
most
choses
in
action
and
intangibles.
we
think
that
is
equally
true
in
view
of
the
statutory
provisions
set
out
on
pages
12
and
13,
showing
the
character
of
silver
certificates,
united
states
notes
and
federal
reserve
notes
that
every
observation
made
by
the
court
in
blodgett
versus
silberman
with
respect
to
united
states
government
bonds
and
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness,
is
equally
applicable
to
paper
money.
there
is
no
question,
i
might
point
out
that
the
$450,000
worth
of
federal
reserve
notes
under
consideration
in
pearson
versus
mcgraw
was
nothing
but
paper
money.
it
does
not
appeal
from
this
court's
opinion
that
that
is
true,
but
in
the
case
as
it
was
heard
in
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
the
opinion
in
that
case
used
this
language
in
discussing
of
whether
or
not,
oregon
protects
the
$450,000
worth
of
federal
reserve
notes.
it
said
in
86
pacific
2nd
at
427,
“the
layman's
word
for
federal
reserve
notes
is
paper
money."
so
in
pearson
versus
mcgraw,
this
court
had
on
the
consideration
whether
or
not,
$450,000
worth
of
paper
money
which
had
never
been
in
oregon
could
be
taxed
by
oregon
and
this
court
held
but
it
could.
the
basis
of
the
decision
in
that
case
was
that
the
$450,000
in
paper
money
was
brought
an
indistinguishable
step
in
a
series
of
steps
amounting
to
a
transfer
of
intangibles
in
contemplation
of
debt.
mr.
justice
stone
in
an
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
concurred,
took
the
view
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
forbad
oregon
to
impose
an
inheritance
tax
upon
the
gift
of
paper
money
even
though
the
paper
money
was
in
illinois.
and
mr.
justice
stone
has
also
pointed
out
that
no
reason
had
been
given
even
in
blodgett
versus
silberman
for
any
different
result.
and
i
think
that
that
is
definitely
an
unarguable
statement.
all
that
was
said
in
blodgett
versus
silberman
was
that
money
was
tangible
personal
property.
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
the
nature
of
bank
notes
nor
was
there
any
reason
supportive
of
the
court's
holding
that
the
money
under
consideration
was
tangible
personal
property.
the
|court
in
blodgett
said,
“we
think
that
money
so
definitely
fixed
and
separate
from
the
domicile
of
decedent
should
be
considered
tangible
personal
property
like
the
paintings
and
furniture
like
in
frick
case.
"
and
in
his
opinion
in
pearson
versus
mcgraw,
mr.
justice
stone
said
and
we
have
set
it
out
on
pages
10
and
11
--
in
the
middle
of
page
11,
“as
i
am
of
the
opinion
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
to
compel
a
state,
to
treat
federal
reserve
notes
for
tax
purposes
as
chattels
were
treated
in
frick
versus
pennsylvania
and
as
no
reason
has
been
advanced
even
in
blodgett
versus
silberman
for
a
different
view,
the
judgment
should
i
think,
be
reversed
rest
upon
this
ground.
i
think
--
and
so
that
the
commonwealth
has
stated
in
his
brief
that
perhaps
the
nub
of
this
case
is
a
manner
of
degree
into
which
category
shall
paper
money
fall.
shall
it
be
deemed
to
be
more
similar
to
united
states
bonds,
treasury
certificates
of
indebtedness
and
other
choses
in
action
or
intangibles
or
shall
it
be
classified
for
purposes
of
constitutional
inheritance
taxation
as
rugs
or
furniture
or
automobiles
as
what's
under
consideration
in
frick
case.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
sir.
we
think
it
would
because
we
think,
that
would
have
had
value
itself,
silver
and
gold
will
have
value
itself.
we
think
that
paper
money
has
no
value,
but
is
merely
an
evidence
of
an
obligation
on
--
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
has
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
has
some
value,
your
honor.
it
does
not
have
the
value
which
the
united
states
government
attributes
to
it,
but
it
does
have
value
and
silver
itself
has
value
in
the
world
markets,
but
the
paper
--
that
will
be,
what
is
the
cost
of
a
--
of
the
value
of
a
dollar
bill,
intrinsically?
you
say,
“it
has
no
intrinsic
value”
and
that
is
the
definition
of
intangible
personal
property.
that
property
which
has
no
intrinsic
value
but
is
merely
representative
or
evidence
of
value
and
we
think
that
the
paper
money
under
consideration
in
this
case,
is
definitely
intangible
and
that
there
is
the
--
there
is
nothing
which
requires
a
state,
in
this
case,
virginia,
to
treat
paper
money
as
rugs,
furniture
and
paintings
were
treated
under
the
frick
rule
--
will
it
be
treated
then?
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
if
--
as
i
understand
it,
if
these
were
considered
to
be
tangible
personal
property,
then
under
the
frick
rule
it
could
only
be
taxed
where
it
is.
if
it's
intangible
personal
property
it
can
definitely
be
taxed
at
the
domicile
of
the
decedent
and
it
maybe
taxed
elsewhere
if
it
has
acquired
a
business
situs
elsewhere
or
something
of
that
nature,
which
would
not
be
true
in
this
case
because
it
was
in
safe
deposit
box.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
--
i
would
think
that
you
would.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
--
i
do
not
know.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
well
under
the
--
i
--
i
don't
know
what
the
law
was
at
that
time,
but
under
--
today
as
you
were
having
of
course,
no
circulating
state
notes,
just
u.s.
government
currency.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
the
word,
bank
notes
drops
out
of
that
portion
of
the
court's
opinion
with
its
initial
mention
in
the
first
line.
(voice
overlap)
thereafter,
the
court
talks
about
coin
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
it's
possible.
i'm
not
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i'm
not
just
familiar
with
the
precise
language
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
would
think
that
only,
only
that
money
which
is
used
as
a
circulating
medium
of
exchange
would
constitute
cash
under
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
word,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
it's
definitely
cash
in
controversy
here
in
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
into
this
no
--
in
the
records.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
the
only
suggestion
i
can
make
is
that
the
opinion
in
that
case,
the
opinion
of
the
state
court,
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut,
may
have
said
that
the
money
was
in
bank
notes
and
coins
and
that
the
(inaudible)
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
have
but
i'm
not
clear
on
that
particular
point,
your
honor.
i
can't
say
(voice
overlap).
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
we
would
have
thought
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
could
not
find
in
the
tax
services
any
indication
that
it
had
been
passed
upon.
the
reason
for
it
apparently
is
this.
broad
statutes
relating
to
inheritance
taxes
generally
say
that
the
property
of
the
decedent
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
state
is
taxable.
and
then
they
go
to
say,
if
it
--
if
it
is
tangible
personal
property
and
is
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state,
then
it's
not
taxable,
but
if
it's
intangible
personal
property,
then
it
is
taxable
here.
now,
unless
a
specific
case
arises
in
which
someone
challenges
a
determination
by
a
state
tax
commission,
that
money
is
intangible
personal
property,
there
would
not
be
any
specific
provision
of
law
to
which
i
could
cite
you
to
say
that
the
law
of
oklahoma
or
texas
or
oregon
holds,
that
money
is
intangible
personal
property,
because
such
a
situation
would
be
similar
to
that
under
consideration
here,
an
administrative
ruling
would
be
made.
now,
we
have
made
some
inquiry.
this
--
the
doctrine
here
that
resulted
in
the
imposition
of
tax
in
this
case,
has
been
the
only
doctrine
in
virginia.
it's
always
been
viewed
to
be
intangible
personal
property
and
we
made
inquiry
of
north
carolina
and
find
that
they
are
of
a
view
of
the
taxability
of
money
under
these
circumstances,
the
(inaudible)
virginia
has
been
for
number
of
years.
we
also
have
additional
inquiries
out
to
which
we
had
not
received
responses
as
of
yesterday
when
i
left
richmond.
but
that
would
be
the
only
way
we
could
establish
what
the
practice
was
in
--
in
the
other
states
because
the
statutes
themselves
would
simply
say
intangible
personal
property
in
this
jurisdiction
is
taxable,
without
any
specific
statute
saying
whether
or
not,
money,
paper
money
was
to
be
deemed
intangible
personal
property.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
other
than
the
administrative
interpretation
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
it
-
it
says
money,
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
i
think
that
that
--
that
would
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
--
i
mean,
i'm
sure
it
would,
in
light
of
the
constitutional
requirements
that
it
was
tangible
personal
property,
virginia
could
not
tax
it,
if
it
were
located
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commonwealth.
so
that
the
money
in
that
case,
would
be
limited
to
paper
money
which
we
had
deemed
intangible
personal
property.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
just
administrate
issues.
i
have
nothing
further,
if
your
honor
please,
unless
you
have
some
--
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
known,
now.
in
the
blodgett
case
was
i
think
about
silver
money,
134
a.
778.
mr.
r.
d.
mcilwaine
iii
yes,
sir.
