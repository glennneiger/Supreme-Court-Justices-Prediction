justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
did
you
say
you
were
reading
from,
mr.
crockett?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
suppose
the
man
had
been
deported
under
the
statute
--
an
order
to
be
deported
under
a
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
--
under
a
statute.
he's
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
ordered
to
be
denaturalized
by
either
one.
and,
that
statute
should
be
held
unconstitutional
thereafter.
he
made
a
motion
under
60
(b)
saying
that
the
law
is
no
good.
now,
he's
convicted
under
orders
to
be
deported
or
to
be
denaturalized
under
a
void
statute.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
that
he
should
be
deprived
of
his
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
deprived
of
any
advantage
under
60
(b),
even
though
you
knew
and
this
government
knew
that
the
statute
was
unimposable
and
has
been
all
the
time
void?
i'm
asking
you
this
to
point
out
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
have
just
reread
what
all
of
them
has
said
on
the
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
that
you
can
say
that
that
those
cases
are
that,
under
the
circumstances
of
those
cases,
they
couldn't
get
it
in
ackerman.
they
couldn't
get
the
advantage
of
60
(b).
i
think
that
they
sat
there
and
the
opinion
went
on
the
ground.
under
those
circumstances,
do
you
think
it
went
any
further
than
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
might
have
--
you
might
have
--
well,
you
might
have
a
different
circuit
court.
what
--
what
is
the
reason
have
you
to
say
that
either
of
those
cases
stand
for
the
principle
that
there
is
now
a
rigid
ruling,
such
as
you
contend
for,
rather
than
a
ruling
saying
that
that
we
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
gather
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
argument
when
you
say
that
there
is
so
much
like
this
that
involved
the
government
acts.
i
don't
--
i
don't
necessarily
agree
with
it.
(inaudible)
i
understand
that
argument,
but
i
don't
understand
why
you
hesitate
to
answering
justice
harlan's
question
when
he
asked
you
if
it,
in
effect,
is
what
held
on
this
issue.
whether
you
call
it
discretion,
anything
else,
you
determine
it
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
do
agree
that
they
held
that
both
of
them
stand
for
the
tranquility
judges
by
the
extraordinary
circumstances
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
is
not
in
discretion,
in
that,
the
court
can
do
what
he
wants
to
because
he
wants
to
and
not
because
he
won.
in
that
sense,
it
would
not
be
discretionary
acts
determined
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
whether
they
meet
this
challenge,
that
rule
which
has
not
been
expressed
in
any
rigid
terms.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
the
argument
now,
that
they
may
be
or
not,
that
maybe
it's
right?
you
seem
to
be
arguing
the
position
that
the
rule
does
rigid,
always
without
regard
to
circumstances,
bar
the
use
of
60
(b)
if
there
--
if
the
man
did
not
appeal
the
judgment
that
was
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see.
i
thought
it
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
something
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
gathered
from
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
just
a
critical
--
the
one
critical
point,
whether
he
doesn't
appeal
or
couldn't
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
how
much
change
had
occurred
in
reference
to
anything
in
the
world
therein.
he
could
have
appealed
and
didn't
know.
are
you
construing
rule
60
(b)
as
barring
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
judgment
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
the
case
you
have
mentioned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
it?
what
was
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
condemnation?
