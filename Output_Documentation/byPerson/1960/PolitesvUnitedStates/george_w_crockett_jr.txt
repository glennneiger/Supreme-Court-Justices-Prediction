members
of
the
court.
i
believe
it
will
be
possible
for
me
to
be
rather
brief
in
my
presentation
because
i
think
the
issue
is
pretty
clear
and
a
pretty
concise
one,
and
there
is
no
material
dispute
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned.
the
petitioner,
a
60-year-old
native
of
greece,
was
naturalized
in
1942
and,
later,
in
1952,
because
of
this
prior
admission
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
during
the
early
years,
his
naturalization
was
cancelled.
it
was
cancelled
upon
the
grounds
that
it
was
fraudulently
obtained,
in
that,
he
had
not
disclosed
to
the
naturalizing
court
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
within
10
years
prior
to
his
naturalization.
the
district
court
ruled
that
the
question
number
28
in
his
petition
for
naturalization
which
was
addressed
to
the
question
of
whether
he
belonged
to
any
organization
that
advocated
our
position
to
organize
government
should
have
been
interpreted
by
him
as
a
question
calling
for
his
admission
or
denial
of
communist
party
membership.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
finding
of
fraud.
the
court
also
ruled
that
his
naturalization
had
been
illegally
procured
because,
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
he
was
a
member
of
an
organization
which
made
him
ineligible
for
membership,
in
that,
under
the
1940
act,
congress
had
amended
the
1906
act
so
as
to
provide
that
teaching
or
advocating
a
membership
in
any
organization
which
teaches
or
advocates
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
should
bar
naturalization.
there
was
nothing,
of
course,
in
the
1940
act
relating
to
communist
party
membership.
the
court,
moreover,
concluded
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
prove
that
the
petitioner
actually
knew
the
communist
party
as
an
organization
that
engaged
in
illegal
teaching
and
advocacy.
that
knowledge
was
of
no
significance,
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
plus
evidence
that
the
communist
party
itself
engaged
in
such
teaching
and
advocacy
was
sufficient
to
bar
him
from
citizenship.
the
petitioner
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
he
was
represented
on
that
appeal
by
my
office.
his
case
was
one
of
approximately
six
cases
of
denaturalization
that
followed
essentially
the
same
pattern,
the
same
charges,
the
same
type
of
evidence.
at
the
time
his
case
was
appealed,
there
was
pending,
in
our
sixth
circuit,
three
denaturalization
cases,
the
chomiak
case,
the
charnowola
case,
and
the
sweet
case
each
of
which
are
referred
to
in
our
brief.
and
each
of
those
cases,
the
identical
issues
that
have
been
raised
and
litigated
in
petitioner's
case
were
likewise
raised.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
following
his
appeal
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
these
appeals
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
would
be
in
1953.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
petitioner's
case
was
appealed,
if
i
remember
correctly,
in
october,
1953.
following
these
appeals
in
the
--
in
petitioner's
case
and
before
the
brief
was
doing
his
case,
we
filed
a
motion
with
the
court
of
appeals
requesting
that
we
be
given
an
extension
of
time
to
file
a
brief
in
this
case
because,
meanwhile,
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
in
each
of
these
other
three
cases
and
we
represent
it
to
the
court
that
we
had
petition
this
court
for
certiorari
to
review
those
cases.
the
government
upholds
that
our
request
for
an
extension
of
time,
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
gave
us
that
extension
conditioned
upon
our
filing
the
brief
within
30
days
after
this
court's
action
in
sweet,
chomiak,
and
charnowola
cases.
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
last
three
cases.
it
may
be
that
we,
as
counsel
for
petitioner,
did
him
an
injustice
by
doing
what,
i
am
persuaded,
every
other
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
has
done
and
every
other
district
court
judge
and
many
circuit
court
judges
have
done
and,
that
is,
to
read
into
a
denial
of
certiorari.
some
indication
that,
of
course,
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
should
not
be
read
into
such
a
denial.
we
advised
the
petitioner
that
it
was
pointless
to
go
ahead
with
this
appeal.
our
circuit
court,
on
three
occasions,
had
turned
us
down.
the
supreme
court
had
denied
certiorari.
the
petitioner
accepted
our
advice
and
stipulated
for
a
dismissal
of
his
appeal.
subsequently,
my
office
represented
the
petitioners
in
the
nowak
and
the
maisenberg
cases.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
the
three
that
i've
mentioned
sweet,
chomiak,
and
charnowola
were
under
the
1940
act.
petitioner's
case
was
under
the
1940
act.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
do
not
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
do
not
say
that
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
--
your
honor.
but,
what
i
do
say
is
that
when
we
go
through
a
period
of
the
length
of
time
that
transpired
between
this
court's
ruling
in
schneiderman
and
the
time
that
this
court
accepted
certiorari
in
nowak.
and,
during
that
period
of
time,
petition
after
petition
was
filed
with
this
court,
asking
for
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
rulings
made
by
the
district
courts
in
denaturalization
cases,
and
this
court
had
indicate
that
it
was
not
prepared
to
examine
those
rulings.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
they
do
not
and
i
mean
no
criticism
of
this
court
when
i
say
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
that
i
myself
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
subsequently,
this
court
accepted
certiorari
in
nowak
and
maisenberg,
which
also
were
handled
by
my
office.
the
government
has
raised
the
question
why,
in
view
of
our
advise
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
we
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
nowak
and
maisenberg
cases.
i
think
this
court
is
aware
that,
subsequent
to
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
sweet,
charnowola,
and
chomiak,
this
court
decided
scotten
which
involved
the
question
of
the
affidavit
of
good
cause.
in
both
nowak
and
maisenberg,
we
had
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
of
good
cause.
it
was
our
position
that
this
court
had
ruled
that
the
affidavit
was
jurisdictional
and
we
raised
the
issue,
can
an
affidavit
which
is
jurisdictional
be
predicated
upon
hearsay.
and,
that
was
the
primary
issue
that
prompted
us,
first,
to
petition
for
certiorari
in
nowak
and
maisenberg,
and
i'm
informed
that
it
was
the
major
issue
that
was
discussed
at
the
time
of
the
oral
argument
in
this
court.
i
mentioned
that
only
parenthetically
to
indicate
that
there
were
some
justification
for
coming
to
the
court
in
nowak
and
maisenberg
that,
in
our
opinion,
did
not
exist
before.
now,
following
this
court's
decision
in
nowak
and
maisenberg,
we
became
satisfied
that
the
judgment
of
denaturalization
against
polites
was
clearly
erroneous.
we,
therefore,
filed
with
the
district
court
a
motion,
under
rule
60
(b)
(5)
and
(6),
asking
that
that
judgment
be
set
aside.
among
other
things,
we
not
only
pointed
out
why
we
thought
the
judgment
of
denaturalization
was
erroneous,
but
we
pointed
out
that
the
government
was
trying
to
take
advantage
of
that
erroneous
judgment
by
now
regarding
the
petitioner
as
an
alien
and
seeking
his
deportation
to
greece
and
his
separation
from
his
family.
that
was
the
gist
of
our
motion
to
the
district
court.
the
government
filed
no
document
in
opposition
to
the
motion,
certainly,
no
pleading.
they
did
file
a
memorandum
of
law
in
opposition
to
the
motion.
the
district
court,
after
discussing
generally
the
impact
of
nowak
and
maisenberg
upon
polites,
finally
decided
that
it
lacked
power
to
grant
the
relief
that
we
sought.
i
believe
that,
therein,
we
have
the
primary
issue
that
is
before
the
court
today.
the
district
court,
in
our
case,
did
not
pass
on
the
merits
whether
or
not
granted
it
has
the
power
it
should
grant
this
relief.
it
said,
"we
understand
the
law
to
be
that
once
you
start
an
appeal
and
you
dismiss
that
appeal,
you
cannot
then
come
to
the
district
court
under
rule
60
(b)
and
ask
for
relief.”
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
that
is
not
the
law.
thank
you.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
the
recess,
i
have
stated
what
i
consider
to
be
the
central
theme
of
my
argument
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
question
of
the
power
of
the
district
court
under
rule
60
(b)
(5)
or
(6)
and
not
whether
or
not
that
power
has
been
properly
exercised
under
the
circumstances.
i
would
buttress
that
by
quoting
from
what
the
district
court
judge
actually
said
at
the
conclusion
of
his
--
or
near
the
conclusion
of
his
opinion.
i'm
quoting
from
page
26
of
my
brief.
he
said
"therefore,
since
petitioner
abandoned
his
appeal,
as
he
states,
because
of
the
controlling
decisions
in
chomiak,
sweet,
and
charnowola,
we
have
absolutely
no
alternative
but
to
follow
the
ackermann
decision
coupled
with
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
statement
in
berryhill
versus
united
states
which
refutes
petitioner's
reasoning
by
saying,
"it
appears
to
be
the
subtle
law
that
a
change
in
the
judicial
view
of
the
applicable
law,
after
a
final
judgment,
is
not
a
basis
for
vacating
a
judgment
entered
before
announcement
of
the
change.”
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
was
reading
from
page
26
and
27.
and
then,
the
district
court
concluded
his
opinion
with
the
following
quotation
which
appears
on
page
11
of
petitioner's
brief.
“ordinarily,
we
would
have
granted
petitioner's
prayer,
particularly
under
subsections
(b)
(5)
of
rule
60,
authorizing
us
to
do
so
if
it
is
no
longer
equitable
that
the
judgment
should
have
prospective
application.
but,
in
our
opinion,
our
court
of
appeals
specifically
eliminates
such
holding
where
the
only
reason
for
abandoning
the
appeal
was
because
of
the
then
status
of
the
law
under
the
controlling
decisions.”
i
submit
that
it's
apparent
from
that
that
the
district
court
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
petitioner's
case
under
rule
60
(b)
and
that,
if
i'm
correct
that
this
is
a
question
of
power
then
we
need
not
come
to
the
other
question,
whether
or
not
the
order
of
denaturalization
in
petitioner's
case
was
actually
erroneous.
i
submit
that
it
probably
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
rule
on
that,
since
all
of
the
facts
in
petitioner's
case
are
not
before
this
court,
since
the
district
court
which
is
more
cumbersome
with
the
record
in
petitioner's
case
will
have
before
it
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
nowak
and
maisenberg
and
can
make
that
initial
determination
for
itself.
i
submit
further,
however,
that
if
the
district
court
came
to
the
conclusion
that
its
judgment
of
denaturalization
was
erroneous,
that
would
be
one
element
to
be
considered
by
the
district
court
in
deciding
whether
relief
should
be
granted
under
rules
60
(b)
(5)
or
(6).
i
do
not
argue
that
that
element
would
be
controlling.
it
would
however,
be
a
consideration
that
i
think
should
influence,
to
some
extent
the
district
court
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
relief.
again,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
for
this
court
to
deciding
whether
or
not
petitioner
was
justified
in
dismissing
his
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals.
there
again,
i
submit
that
that
is
an
additional
element
that
would
or
would
not
influence
the
district
court
in
exercising
its
discretion
if
it
got
to
the
merits.
now,
the
government
argues
and
i
might
say
before
i
go
into
that
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
only
two
decisions
in
this
court
dealing
with
rule
60
(b)
(5)
and
(6)
and
i
don't
think
the
government
relies
on
any
others
that's
the
klapprott
case
--
klapprott
against
united
states
which
is
cited
in
both
briefs
and
the
ackermann
case
which
likewise
is
cited
in
both
briefs.
in
ackermann,
on
which
the
government
places
primary
reliance,
the
district
court
there
did
not
say,
"i
do
not
have
power
to
grant
the
relief."
the
district
court
said
"i
am
denying
your
motion
on
the
merits.
i
have
considered
all
of
these
extenuating
circumstances
that
you
present,
and
i
am
not
persuaded,
in
the
exercise
of
my
discretion,
that
i
should
vacate
the
judgment."
and,
all
that
this
court
said
was,
"we
find
no
basis
for
disturbing
the
discretion
exercised
by
the
district
court.”
so,
ackermann
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction
on
its
face.
by
necessary
implication,
i
would
submit
that
ackermann
holds
that
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
power
to
grant
the
relief
prayed
for
by
the
petitioner
there
and
by
analogy
that
the
district
court,
in
polites
case,
had
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
power
to
grant
the
relief
prayed
by
polites.
now,
klapprott,
i
believe,
might
be
interpreted
as
actually
going
to
the
question
of
power.
there,
the
petitioner
alleged,
among
other
things,
that
he
was
imprisoned
at
the
time
of
his
denaturalization
proceedings
that,
through
a
various
unfortunate
circumstances,
he
was
prevented
from
defending
his
case
and,
as
a
result,
he
was
denaturalized
by
means
of
a
default
judgment.
this
court
considered
his
petition
and,
among
other
things,
this
court
ruled
that
rule
60
(b)
was
intended
to
give
very
liberal
power
to
the
district
courts
to
correct
manifest
injustices.
that
,among
other
things,
it
was
intended
to
eliminate
some
of
the
restrictions
that
had
been
placed
upon
district
courts
in
vacating
or
changing
judgments
at
the
expiration
of
a
term.
so
that
rule
60
(b)
is
not,
for
example,
comparable
to
a
bill
of
review
or
a
bill
in
the
nature
of
review
and
equity.
it
goes
beyond
even
those
liberal
rules
that
were
devised
by
the
old
common
law
--
or
the
old
equity
courts,
rather,
to
take
care
of
this
case
of
what
happens
where
a
judgment,
in
its
prospective
effect,
has
unfortunate
consequences
from
which
the
person
should
be
relieved.
the
court,
among
other
things,
in
ackermann
decided
that,
there,
the
petition
had
set
up
sufficient
facts
which,
if
true,
would
warrant
relief.
accordingly,
this
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
do
what?
to
frame
the
issue,
to
take
testimony
on
whether
or
not
this
was
a
case
of
extraordinary
circumstances
warranting
the
use
of
rule
60
(b).
to
that
extent,
this
court
has
held,
i
contend,
in
kalpprott
that
the
district
court
here
in
polites
had
power,
had
jurisdiction
to
do
what
we
have
requested
should
be
done.
now,
of
course,
all
of
us
are
concerned
about
the
finality
of
judgments
and
the
government
makes
the
big
argument
that
if
this
can
happen
in
polites
case,
then
it's
rather
difficult
to
conceive
of
any
situation
where
judgment
of
denaturalization
becomes
final.
i
don't
experience
any
difficulty
with
that
argument
because
i
think
the
whole
judicial
process
is
one
of
balancing.
here,
we
have
to
balance
what
petitioner
contends
is
an
obvious
injustice
that
results
to
him
based
upon
an
erroneous
judgment
against
the
desire
to
maintain
stability
of
judgments.
and,
i
think,
in
that
very
balancing
process,
we
are
doing
what
the
district
court
here
has
declined
to
do
because
the
district
court
has
declined
to
enter
into
that
balancing
process
by
not
actually
accepting
jurisdiction
in
getting
to
the
merits.
i
could,
of
course,
prolong
this
argument
by
going
into
a
differentiation
of
the
various
cases
cited
by
the
government.
i
think,
however,
that
a
simple
reading
of
those
cases
will
indicate
that
they're
distinguishable
on
their
face.
i
would,
however,
call
attention
to
the
sunal
case
which
is
primarily
relied
upon
by
the
government
and
is
cited
in
its
brief.
sunal,
i
believe,
it's
called,
against
large.
that
case
was
a
case
where
this
court,
after
denying
certiorari,
subsequently
granted
certiorari
and,
in
effect,
changed
the
rule
of
law.
sunal
was
charged
with
failing
to
report
for
induction
into
the
armed
services.
among
other
things,
he
contended
that
he
was
improperly
classified.
the
district
court
ruled,
relying
upon
prior
decisions,
that
the
defense
of
improper
classification
could
not
be
made
at
the
time
of
trial,
that
it
had
been
administratively
determined
and
that
was
the
end
to
it.
sunal
was
convicted.
he
did
not
take
an
appeal.
a
similar
situation,
a
companion
case,
was
the
kulick
case
that
happened
in
the
second
circuit.
subsequent
to
these
convictions,
this
court
ruled
that
the
defense
of
improper
classification
could
be
asserted
at
the
time
of
the
trial
for
the
main
offense.
sunal
then
made
application
not
under
rule
60
(b)
but
by
petition
for
habeas
corpus
to
have
his
conviction
set
aside.
this
court
divided
on
that
issue
but
the
majority
opinion
concluded
that
there
was
not
sufficient
justification
shown
for
setting
aside
the
conviction.
i'm
primarily
concerned,
however,
with
the
rule
that
was
announced
by
the
majority
in
that
case,
and
i
quote
that
rule,
it
was
as
follows.
“the
rule
which
requires
resort
to
appellate
procedure
for
the
correction
of
errors
is
not
one
defining
power
but
one
which
relates
to
the
appropriate
exercise
of
power.
that
rule
is,
therefore,
not
so
inflexible
that
it
may
not
yield
to
exceptional
circumstances
where
the
need
for
the
remedy
afforded
by
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
apparent.”
i
submit
that
the
same
considerations
should
control
in
applying
rule
60
(b)
(5)
or
(6)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
that,
in
its
very
nature,
the
district
court
is
in
the
most
advantageous
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
injustice
which
the
petitioner
allegedly
will
suffer,
by
giving
prospective
effect
to
the
judgment
or
by
continuing
an
operation
of
judgment
which
he
thinks
or
which
the
district
court
finds
have
been
erroneous
outweighs
the
desirability
of
maintaining
the
stability
of
judgments
and
it
is
upon
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
might
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
think
you
--
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor,
but
i
also
think
that
there
were
other
cases
even
before
the
promulgation
of
rule
60
(b)
and
even
before
sunal
that
did
not
arise
under
any
rule
but
arose
under
the
general
powers
of
equity
to
give
relief
where
there
have
been
a
substantial
change
in
the
law.
and,
in
none
of
those
cases
did
the
court
hold
that
the
fact
that
an
appeal
was
or
was
not
taken
was
decisive
of
the
issue.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
wouldn't
go
so
far,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
as
to
say
that
was
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
was
the
only
consideration
that
influenced
the
majority
in
sunal
merely
because
he
did
not
take
an
appeal.
the
court
discussed
the
circumstances
also
under
which
he
did
not
take
an
appeal
as
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
no,
i
think
you
had
another
element
there
that
i
emphasize
in
my
brief
in
my
discussion
of
the
title
case,
and
that
is
that,
within
the
time
that
was
still
available
to
sunal
to
take
an
appeal,
this
court
had
indicated
a
willingness
to
consider
the
question.
that
was
true
in
the
title
case.
for
example,
within
the
time
that
title's
appeal
was
still
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court
granted
certiorari
in
the
zucca
case.
title
must
have
known,
his
counsel
must
have
known
that
this
court
would
then
resolve
the
question
of
affidavit
that
was
presented
in
zucca
--
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
and,
notwithstanding
that,
he
did
nothing
to
protect
his
right
to
appeal.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
mr.
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
deal
very
briefly
with
one
or
two
points
advanced
by
counsel,
which
i
think
are
readily
answerable.
he
places,
i
believe,
undue
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
the
appeal
in
this
case
was
dismissed
with
prejudice.
i
do
not
think
any
significance
attaches
to
the
words
with
prejudice
because
the
--
the
appeal
was
dismissed
approximately
one
year
after
it
was
taken
and
it
would
necessarily
be
with
prejudice.
he
suggests
further
that
this
is
an
attempt
by
the
petitioner
to
gain
a
retrial
of
his
denaturalization
proceeding
under
circumstances
where
he
thinks
the
outcome
will
be
more
favorable.
i
deny
that
because
the
petitioner
is
not
asking
for
a
retrial.
he
does
not
regard
this
as
a
matter
of
appeal.
i
thought
i
made
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
we
would
suggest
to
the
district
court
that,
in
the
light
of
maisenberg
and
nowak,
a
reconsideration
of
the
facts
in
petitioner's
case
might
warrant
that
court
in
concluding
that
petitioner's
case
was
decided
erroneously.
the
court
does
not
necessarily
have
to
conclude
that.
the
court
might
very
well
say,
“well,
in
the
light
of
those
decisions,
i
am
still
not
persuaded
that
the
government
has
proved
the
case
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
and,
yet,
i
do
not
feel
sufficiently
doubtful
to
cancel
denaturalization,
but
i
do
feel
sufficiently
doubtful
to
listen
to
these
other
considerations
that
he
is
mentioning.
the
primary
one
being,
should
this
judgment
be
allowed
to
serve
as
a
foundation,
as
a
springboard
for
the
government
to
now
uproot
this
man
and
send
him
back
to
another
country.”
now,
impinging
on
such
a
consideration
would
be
such
other
factors
as
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
been
a
law-abiding
citizen
in
this
country
ever
since
he
came
here
at
the
age
of
16
years
of
age.
he
is
60
years
of
age
now.
he
needs
a
little
help
and
i
think
the
immigration
service
is
aware
of
that.
i
pointed
out
in
our
petition
for
certiorari.
in
addition
to
that,
he
has
no
family
in
greece.
his
entire
family
is
here,
his
american-born
wife,
his
two
children,
and
his
two
grandchildren.
he
is
not
employed
now.
now,
all
of
those
are
considerations
that
tend
to
show
what,
i
agree
ackermann
and
klapprott
point
out,
must
be
an
extraordinary
situation.
but,
there
is
another
extraordinary
situation
here
that
was
not
present
in
ackermann,
for
example,
and
that
stems
from
new
legislation.
in
ackermann,
the
petitioner
was
not
threatened
with
denaturalization.
there
was
no
statute
that
provided
that,
for
conduct
which
he
had
done
in
the
past,
he
could
now
be
deported.
meanwhile,
in
this
case,
there
is
such
a
statute.
congress
has
provided
that
if,
at
any
time,
you
were
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
you
are
an
alien,
you
can
be
deported.
so,
we
have
a
combination
of
circumstances
here.
because
of
his
denaturalization,
he
is
an
alien.
because
of
an
act
that
he
is
--
that
he
admittedly
did
back
in
the
early
1930s,
he
admitted
membership
in
the
communist
party,
he
can
now
be
deported.
but,
that
can
only
follow
so
long
as
the
judgment
of
denaturalization
is
allowed
to
have
prospective
application,
so
long
as
the
judgment
of
denaturalization
can
serve
as
a
basis
for
regarding
him
as
an
alien.
now,
those
are
factors,
which
i
again
submit,
are
more
--
i
would
not
say
more
capably,
but
i
would
say
a
more
easily
assessed
on
the
district
court
level
than
they
are
on
the
level
of
this
court.
now,
the
chief
justice
asked
counsel
whether
or
not,
in
the
ackermann
case,
the
court
there
--
the
district
court
reached
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits.
and,
as
i
understood
counsel's
answer,
he
suggested
that
there
was
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.
however,
i
believe
an
examination
of
that
case
will
indicate
the
following,
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
in
an
order
which
stated,
“there
is
no
merit
to
said
motion.”
and
then,
the
court
went
on
to
point
out
why
it
felt
that
there
was
no
merit
to
the
application
for
relief.
the
court
clearly
indicated,
“if
there
were
merit,
i
have
power
in
the
sense
of
having
jurisdiction
to
grant
that
relief.”
now,
counsel
did
not
set
forth,
in
answer
to
several
questions
from
the
bench,
what
are
the
normally
recognized
standards
for
granting
relief
under
section
60
(b)
--
60
(b)
(5)
and
(6)?
and,
is
it
an
unfailing
rule
that
merely
because
one
fails
to
appeal,
that,
in
itself,
precludes
him
from
getting
a
relief
under
rule
60
(b)
(5)
or
(6).
well,
there
are
several
standards
for
playing
rule
60
(b)
(5)
or
(6).
normally,
the
court
will
not
grant
relief
on
either
of
those
sections
if
intervening
rights
of
third
parties
have
become
vested.
let's
take
one
case
decided
by
the
government
in
its
brief,
collins
against
wichita.
that
was
a
condemnation
proceeding
and,
incidentally,
there,
an
appeal
was
taken
and
this
court
denied
certiorari,
and
then
an
application
was
made
for
relief
based
upon
a
later
decision
of
this
court
which
held
that
the
statute
providing
for
notice
in
the
condemnation
proceeding
was
unconstitutional.
the
court
there
denied
relief
not
because
an
appeal
was
not
taken
because
an
appeal
was
taken.but
there
had
been
intervening
rights
of
third
parties.
the
city
had
condemned
the
property
and
put
in
a
very
expensive
water
main.
the
court
said,
“where
real
estate
rights
like
that
are
concerned,
we
will
not
disturb
it.”
and,
the
same
thing
is
true
in
these
other
so-called
condemnation
cases.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
find
conflict
in
those
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because,
here,
you
do
not
have
any
intervening
rights
of
third
parties
vested,
as
the
government
itself,
which
put
my
petition
in
this
predicament,
which
is
now
seeking
to
take
advantage
of
the
subsequent
more
liberal
interpretation
of
the
law
made
by
this
court.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
the
government
was
the
one
that
instituted
the
denaturalization
proceeding
against
him.
the
government
was
the
one
who
trust
the
district
court
to
make
a
judgment,
which
we
contend
was
an
erroneous
judgment.
i
don't
go
into
a
discussion
of
why
the
judgment
is
erroneous,
but
let's
assume
that
the
judgment
was
erroneous
and
that
the
district
court
decides
that
it
was
erroneous.
mr.
george
w.
crockett,
jr.
i
suppose
i
turn
then
your
honor
to
the
discussion
of
whether
or
not
the
judgment
itself
is
erroneous.
i
don't
feel
that
it
is
necessary
to
get
to
that
point,
but
since
the
counsel
has
spent
quite
a
bit
of
time
talking
about
it,
i
would
like
to
do
the
same
thing.
he
begins
by
conceding
that
the
judgment
is
erroneous
under
nowak
and
maisenberg
insofar
as
it
found
that
my
client
was
had
procured
his
naturalization
by
fraud
or,
be
it,
the
government's
brief
waits
until
i
think
it
is
the
very
last
footnote
in
which
that
concession
is
made.
so,
the
idea
of
fraud
is
completely
out
of
the
case.
we
go
then
to
the
other
ground
for
denaturalization,
which
was
illegal
procurement.
now,
there,
the
government
is
on
very
tenuous
ground.
first,
they
quote
from
mr.
justice
douglas,
but
i
think
they
do
a
disservice
to
mr.
justice
douglas
in
their
quotation
because
at
that
time,
the
statute
specifically
mentioned
anarchist
and
precluded
the
naturalization
of
anarchist.
the
statute
did
not
pro
--
specifically
mentioned
communist.mr.
justice
douglas
was
merely
saying
“if
congress
had
said
no
communist
shall
be
granted
citizenship,
then,
obviously,
proof
that
a
man
was
a
communist
was
all
that
was
necessary.
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says
at
that
time.
it
was
not
until
1952
that
statute
was
amended
to
make
any
such
provision.
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
concludes
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
the
petitioner
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
the
communist
party,
within
the
10-year-period
taught
and
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
the
court
did
not
go
on
to
find,
and
specifically
disclaim
any
intention
to
find,
that
this
petitioner
had
knowledge
of
any
such
illegal
advocacy.
the
government
argues
that
we,
on
this
occasion,
do
--
that
we
concede
that
the
communist
party
was
an
organization
that
taught
and
advocated
according
to
this
record.
we
make
no
such
concession.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
repeatedly
that
we
are
incorporating
by
a
reference,
all
of
the
pertinent
arguments
that
we
made
in
the
nowak
case
and,
in
addition,
on
page
21,
i
think,
this
--
of
our
brief
where
we
discussed
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
we
point
out
here
that
the
evidence
did
not
show,
in
our
view
of
the
evidence,
illegal
teaching
and
advocacy
and
certainly
did
not
show
knowledge
on
the
part
teaching
and
advocacy
and
certainly,
it
did
not
show
knowledge
on
the
part
of
this
petitioner.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
the
evidence
did
not
show
illegal
teaching
and
advocacy?
first,
because
you
have
here
no
more
than
the
evidence
that
you
had
in
the
nowak
case.
and,
there,
the
court
was
unable
to
conclude
that
the
proofs
were
sufficient
to
show
that
the
party
taught
and
advocated
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
court
said
assuming
that
without
deciding
it.
but,
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
also
called
attention
to
its
previous
decision
in
yates
versus
united
states
where
it
clearly
pointed
out
that
the
teaching
and
the
advocacy
must
be
of
a
character
that
incites
to
action
and
that
in
the
absence
of
any
such
showing
of
incitement,
you
could
not
say
this
was
the
kind
of
teaching
and
advocacy
contemplated
by
congress
in
the
use
of
those
words
which
have
come
to
be
words
of
art.
obviously,
when
you
read
the
quotations
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
the
references
that
are
made
in
the
government's
brief,
i
think
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that,
here,
again,
the
government
has
failed
to
show
by
clear
convincing
unequivocal
evidence
that
the
communist
party
in
1930
when
the
petitioner
admittedly
was
a
member
of
it,
engaged
in
teaching
in
advocacy
of
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
in
words
of
incitement
to
action.
there
is
no
such
indication
here
in
the
record.
now,
this
whole
idea
of
what
constitutes
illegal
procurement
is
one
that
seems
to
have
confused
the
district
courts
for
a
long,
long
period
of
time.
in
the
schumer
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
i
believe
you
will
find
the
one
and
only
decision
with
exception
of
the
subsequent
decision
in
polites'
case
where
a
district
court
has
held
that
a
mere
showing
of
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
that
the
communist
party
was
an
organization
that
taught
and
advocated
force
and
violence
without
any
indication
of
any
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
of
such
teaching
and
advocacy
constituted
illegal
procurement.
as
a
result
of
those
two
decisions,
i
might
say,
both
of
those
two
decisions
were
considered
by
judge
goodman
of
the
northern
district
of
california
who,
i
might
say
parenthetically,
is
regarded
in
many
courts
as
being
an
authority
on
immigration
law,
has
having
been
erroneously
decided.
he
interprets
illegal
procurement
to
mean
any
instance
where
the
record
on
the
denaturalization
proceeding
fails
to
show
that
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute
were
met
before
there
was
a
grant
of
citizenship.
and
so,
he
says
“ginsberg?
that's
correct.”
the
record
there
clearly
showed
that
he
was
granted
citizenship
without
the
requirement
of
a
hearing
in
open
court.
he
goes
on
to
consider
the
other
cases
dealing
with
residence
and
so
forth.
that
interpretation
makes
sense.
applying
that
to
polites'
case
where
is
there
anywhere
in
the
record
of
his
naturalization
any
proof
that
the
communist
party
--
any
proof,
one,
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
and
two,
that
the
communist
party
at
that
time
taught
and
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
the
court
made
no
such
finding.
on
the
record
of
his
naturalization,
every
requirement
made
by
congress
in
the
statute
was
satisfied.
under
those
con
--
circumstances
it
cannot
i
contend
be
logically
argued
that
his
citizenship
was
illegally
procured.
now,
i
desire
to
take
up
just
one
final
point
and
that
brings
me
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
district
court
here
was
justified
in
concluding
that
merely
because
of
the
failure
to
appeal,
there
was
no
power
in
the
district
court
to
grant
the
relief.
and
in
that
connection,
i
want
to
call
attention
to
the
case
cited
in
the
government's
brief
the
elgin
case
on
page
29
and
point
out
that
in
that
case
an
appeal
was
actually
taken
and
relief
was
denied
but
when
later
a
petition
was
made
setting
four
circumstances
that
showed
an
extraordinary
situation
within
the
--
within
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
the
court
did
not
say
merely
because
you
took
an
appeal
and
the
issue
has
already
been
resolved,
we
will
not
grant
you
relief.
instead,
the
district
court
granted
the
relief.
the
circuit
court
said,
“we
see
no
basis
for
disturbing
the
discretion
that
was
exercised
by
the
district
court.”
so,
we
submit
--
may
it
please
the
court
that
in
this
case
the
appropriate
remedy
would
be
to
send
this
case
back
to
the
district
court
just
as
was
done
in
klapprott
with
directions
take
testimony
and
determine
whether
or
not
this
is
an
exceptional
situation
within
the
prior
holdings
of
this
court,
and
if
you
find
or
if
you
do
not
find
that
this
is
an
exceptional
situation
then
exercise
your
discretion
in
determining
whether
or
not
relief
should
be
granted.
thank
you.
