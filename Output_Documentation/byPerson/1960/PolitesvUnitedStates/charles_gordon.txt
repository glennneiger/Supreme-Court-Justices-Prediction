mr.
charles
gordon
may
it
please
the
court.
the
simple
and
the
overwriting
question
which
is
presented
by
this
appeal
is
whether
a
litigant
who
has
lost
his
case
after
a
full
day
in
court
and
who
has
voluntarily
relinquished
his
right
of
appeal
can
renew
the
controversy
five
years
later
merely
because
he
thinks
that
he
then
would
have
a
better
chance
to
prevail.
in
our
view,
an
affirmative
answer
to
that
question
would
discard
the
ancient
principles
that
safeguard
the
finality
of
judgments.
it
would
mean
that
no
controversy
could
ever
be
regarded
as
ultimately
settled
and
that
an
unsuccessful
litigant
would
have
a
right
at
any
time
in
the
future
to
reopen
the
case
when
he
deemed
to
be
time
propitious.
now,
in
this
case,
the
facts
are
quite
simple.
a
denaturalization
suit
was
brought
against
mr.
polites
10
years
after
his
naturalization.
the
suit
was
commenced
in
1952.
a
trial
took
place
in
1953.
the
trial
covered
four
days
and,
at
that
trial,
polites
was
represented
by
his
present
counsel.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
judge
picard
of
the
district
court
of
detroit
found
that
the
naturalization
had
been
fraudulently
and
illegally
procured,
and
he
ordered
the
denaturalization.
now,
polites
then
filed
an
appeal,
but
he
never
completed
that
appeal.
instead,
as
mr.
crockett
has
said,
he,
first,
obtained
from
the
court
of
appeals
an
extension
of
his
time
in
which
to
file
briefs.
and,
this
was
done
because
the
court
of
appeals
then
had
under
consideration,
three
cases
involving
similar
issues.
one
was
identical.
the
others
were
similar.
in
the
--
in
the
chomiak
case,
the
issue
was
identical.
in
the
others,
the
issues
were
similar.
the
others
claimed
only
fraud.
chomiak
--
they
may
have
claimed
both
fraud
and
illegality.
cromi
--
chomiak
was
decided
only
on
the
issue
of
illegality
based
on
section
305.
they
were
quite
similar.
then,
when
chomiak,
charnowola,
and
sweet
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals,
they
applied
for
certiorari
and
certiorari
was
denied.
at
that
time,
petitioner's
counsel
who
re
--
also
represented
sweet,
chomiak,
and
charnowola
voluntarily
stipulated
to
dismiss
the
appeal
of
polites
with
prejudice.
this
was
the
language
of
the
stipulation.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
november
of
1954,
entered
an
order
on
that
stipulation,
dismissing
the
appeal
with
prejudice.
that,
again,
was
the
language
of
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals.
and
then,
deportation
proceedings
followed.
the
deportation
order
was
entered.
a
judicial
review
to
the
deportation
order
was
commenced.
and,
while
the
proceedings
for
judicial
review
of
the
deportation
order
were
pending,
polites
brought
this
motion
to
reopen
the
1953
judgment,
to
reopen
it
because,
as
he
said,
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
nowak
and
maisenberg
had
changed
the
picture.
now,
this
motion,
your
honors,
was
brought
five
years
after
the
original
judgment
and
four
years
after
plaintiff,
through
his
--
petitioner,
through
his
counsel,
had
voluntarily
stipulated
to
abandon
his
appeal.
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
talking
about
polites.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
--
and
the
certiorari
was
denied
and
that
--
we
have
a
three-prong
position
here,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
gordon
our
answer
is
no.
we
have
three
facets
of
our
position.
in
the
first
place,
after
an
order
has
become
final,
a
judgment
has
become
final,
we
believe
that
the
rule
60
(b)
itself
in
its
historical
context,
in
the
light
of
everything
that
went
before,
in
the
light
of
every
adjudication
on
the
rule,
precludes
reopening
of
the
judgment
merely
because
the
party
thinks
that
he'd
have
a
better
chance.
secondly,
we
say
that,
in
this
case,
polites
had
a
chance
to
appeal.
he
had
a
chance
to
present
his
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
this
court.
he
voluntarily
relinquished
his
right
of
appeal
without
any
suggestion
of
broader
imposition
or
impropriety
and
we
feel
that
he
is
bound
by
that
choice.
and,
third,
we
say
that,
because
he
voluntarily
entered
into
this
stipulation,
agreeing
to
dismiss
the
appeal
with
prejudice
is
bound
by
the
terms
of
that
stipulation,
unless
something
unconscionable
appears
and
we
find
nothing
in
this
record
which
even
suggests
inequity
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
the
third
is
slightly
different
because
he
stipulated
to
appeal
--
to
dismiss
the
appeal
with
prejudice
knowing
the
consequences.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
second
is
that
he
abandoned
the
appeal.
there's
a
li
--
a
little
difference
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
--
it
may
not
be
very
great
but
there's
some
difference.
but,
in
any
event,
we
feel
that,
under
each
of
these
theories,
petitioner
is
far
close
from
relief.
now,
the
motion
to
reopen
was
denied
by
judge
picard
and
then
appeal
followed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which,
in
the
very
terse
order,
unanimously
affirmed
judge
picard's
order
for
the
reasons
that
he
has
stated.
now,
as
i've
said
the
motion
to
reopen
was
based
on
--
it
was
made
in
1958
incidentally
and
was
based
on
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
1958
in
the
nowak
and
maisenberg
cases.
we
believe
those
decisions
and
we
shall
show
later
that
those
decisions
are
inevitable,
but
i
think
it's
more
important
to
confront,
first,
at
the
outset
the
propriety
of
the
relief
which
is
sought
by
the
petitioner
here.
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
no
warrant
in
rule
60
(b),
or
elsewhere,
for
this
effort
to
reopen
a
five-year-old
judgment
made
by
one
who
voluntarily
elected
to
dismiss
his
appeal
without
any
showing
of
fraud,
risk,
impropriety,
improper
activities
of
government
officials,
or
any
other
reason
for
disturbing
the
judgment.
in
fact,
in
our
view,
this
belated
plea
lies
in
the
face
of
the
need
for
an
orderly
administration
of
justice
and
is
directly
opposed
to
at
least
two
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
we
agree
that
naturalization
is
a
precious
privilege
and
that
citizenship
rights
must
receive
full
protection,
but
it
also
must
be
remembered
that
the
right
to
citizenships
through
naturalization
is
granted
and
may
be
revoked
through
a
judicial
proceeding.
the
applicant
for
naturalization
is
given
his
day
in
court
when
he
seeks
citizenship
and
he
is
also
given
his
day
in
court
when
the
government
moves
to
revoke
that
citizenship
grant.
polites
had
his
day
in
court.
he
had
a
full
day
in
court.
and
when
the
decision
again
--
went
against
him,
he
decided
not
to
appeal.
we
believe
that
under
such
circumstances,
polites
like
every
other
litigant
is
bound
by
the
judgment
against
him.
now,
rule
60
(b)
obviously
was
not
intended
as
a
substitute
for
an
appeal.
in
my
view,
there
is
no
sound
basis
for
supporting
the
view
that
this
rule
grants
the
right
to
a
defeated
party
sometime
in
the
future
to
seek
a
reopening
of
the
judgment
merely
because
subsequent
adjudications
persuaded
that
he
now
might
have
a
better
chance
particularly
where
he
voluntarily
relinquished
the
right
to
test
that
theory
in
the
original
proceedings.
there
are
many
authorities
which
oppose
the
position
urged
by
the
petitioner
here
and
of
course
the
most
telling
and
convincing
authority,
in
my
view
is
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
ackermann
case
340
us
i
think
the
ackermann
case
is
exactly
like
this
but
i
can't
see
any
possible
basis
for
distinction.
the
ackermanns
--
like
this
petitioner
lost
a
denaturalization
suit.
they
--
thereafter
considered
the
possibility
of
appealing.
they
decided
not
to
appeal
and
voluntarily
abandoned
the
right
to
appeal.
in
making
this
determination
they
were
influenced
by
the
fact
that
the
appeal
would
be
expensive,
that
it
would've
resulted
in
their
having
to
sell
their
home,
and
also
by
the
advice
of
an
official
of
the
immigration
of
naturalization
service
who
told
them
that
in
his
opinion
the
appeal
would
be
futile.
they
relied
on
his
advice
and
did
not
take
the
appeal.
now,
a
co-defendant
in
the
ackermann
case,
a
fellow
named
keilbar,
did
take
an
appeal.
keilbar
was
the
brother
of
mrs.
ackermann.
he
wanted
to
defend
his
citizenship
rights
and,
therefore,
he
took
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
while
that
appeal
was
pending,
this
court
decided
the
baumgardner
case
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
theory
on
which
the
judgment
of
denaturalization
in
the
ackermann
case
rested.
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
ackermann
case,
keilbar
obtained
a
reversal
of
the
denaturalization
judgment.
four
years
after
the
original
denaturalization
judgment
in
the
ackermann
case,
the
ackermanns
made
a
motion
to
reopen
the
judgment
under
rule
60
(b)
claiming
that,
because
of
the
intervening
decisions
in
the
keilbar
case
and
in
the
baumgardner
case,
it
was
no
longer
equitable
to
enforce
this
denaturalization
decree
against
it.
yet,
this
court
determined
that,
under
such
circumstances,
rule
60
(b)
did
not
afford
a
basis
for
relief.
now,
at
page
20
in
our
brief,
we
have
an
excerpt
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
ackermann,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
used
by
the
court
in
that
case
is
directly
important.
i
should
like
to
refer
to
it.
the
court
said,
“petitioner
made
a
considered
choice
not
to
appeal,
apparently,
because
he
did
not
feel
that
the
appeal
would
be
worth
--
would
prove
to
be
worth
what
he
thought
was
a
required
sacrifice
of
his
home."
his
choice
was
a
risk,
both
calculated
and
deliberate
and
such
as
follows
in
free
choice.
petitioner
cannot
be
relieved
of
such
a
choice
because
hindsight
seems
to
indicate
to
him
that
his
decision
not
to
appeal
was
probably
wrong,
considering
the
outcome
of
the
keilbar
case.
there
must
be
an
end
to
litigation
someday
and
free,
calculated,
and
deliberate
choices
are
not
to
be
relieved
from.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
merits
--
by
the
merits,
you
mean
the
question
of
whether
the
individual
was
properly
denaturalized
or
whether
relief
under
60
(b)
was
available?
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
only
to
the
question
of
whether
relief
under
60
(b)
was
available.
mr.
charles
gordon
in
--
in
ackermann?
mr.
charles
gordon
the
--
the
reopening
was
refused.
mr.
charles
gordon
on
--
no,
on
the
applicability
of
rule
60
(b).
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
under
--
mr.
charles
gordon
--
the
circumstances,
the
court
did
not
have
the
power.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor
discretion,
i
think
is
a
treacherous
word
here.
i
think,
in
the
construction
of
the
rule,
the
construction
by
this
court
in
the
ackermann
case,
the
keilbar
case,
the
rule
of
courts
relief
in
a
situation
of
this
type
of
an
old
judgment,
only
when
there
are
exceptional
circumstances.
now,
if
the
exceptional
circumstances
support
the
framework
of
the
discretion,
then
i
agree
with
you
your
honor
that
it's
discretionary.
but,
the
rule
is
that
there
can
be
no
reopening
unless
there
are
exceptional
circumstances.
and
in
this
case,
there
are
no
exceptional
circumstances
of
the
type
which
are
contemplated
in
klapprott
and
ackermann.
now,
three
members
of
the
court
dissented
in
that,
but
their
dissent
rested
solely
on
their
belief
that
the
right
to
appeal
that
--
that
the
petitioner
in
that
case
had
been
redirected
from
appealing
by
the
improper
action
of
government
officials.
this,
they
felt
was
an
exceptional
circumstance
which
justifies
relief.
now,
in
ackermann,
this
court
distinguished
its
prior
holding
a
year
earlier
in
the
klapprott
case
which
mr.
clark
had
just
adverted.
klapprott
also
was
a
denaturalization
suit.
klapprott
had
defaulted
in
answering.
he
had
not
interposed
an
answer.
there
had
been
no
trial
of
the
issue.
judgment
by
default
had
been
entered
against
him.
then,
four
years
later
he
made
a
motion
under
rule
60
(b)
to
reopen
the
judgment
claiming
that
he
had
been
prevented
from
defending
by
illness,
lack
of
funds
by
interference
of
fbi
agents,
by
imprisonment,
and
by
similar
circumstances.
now,
the
opinions
in
the
klapprott
case
were
concerned
chiefly
with
the
propriety
of
a
default
judgment,
but
they
did
make
some
significant
observations
in
regard
to
the
propriety
of
rule
60
(b)
relief.
originally
the
courts
directed
that
the
default
be
vacated
--
the
judgment
be
vacated
and
that
the
case
be
sent
back
for
a
completely
new
trial
of
the
issue.
however,
on
reconsideration
the
court
modified
its
order
and
merely
sent
the
case
back
for
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
the
default
had
been
deliberate.
a
hearing
was
conducted.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
--
that
the
default
had
been
deliberate
and
refused
to
reopen
the
judgment.
that
determination
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
this
court
denied
certiorari
thus,
appears
that
klapprott
is
opposed
to
the
position
here.
for
there,
the
court
refused
to
reopen
a
default
in
answering
where
there
had
been
a
determination
that
the
default
was
deliberate.
i
think
the
proper
formulation,
the
proper
approach
to
these
cases,
was
that
of
mr.
justice
black
in
his
opinion
in
the
klapprott
case.
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
black
said
that
a
party
could
be
relieved
from
a
default
in
answering
that
case
or
for
appealing,
as
in
this
case,
only
if
there
were
a
special
situation.
this
was
the
language
of
mr.
justice
black.
“an
extraordinary
situation”
i
believe
was
the
language
which,
in
effect,
prevented
him
from
appealing.
this
formulation
was
adopted
by
the
court
in
the
ackermann
case.
and
there,
the
prevailing
opinion
said
the
party
can
be
relieved
from
his
default
in
appearing
--
in
appealing,
as
in
that
case,
only
upon
a
showing
of
extraordinary
circumstances.
this
was
the
language
of
the
ackermann
case
which
prevented
him
from
exercising
his
right
to
defend
or
exercising
his
right
to
appeal,
as
in
ackermann.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
obviously
are
no
special
or
extraordinary
circumstances
such
as
those
contemplated
by
the
ackermann
and
the
klapprott
cases.
in
the
first
place,
just
--
mr.
justice
black,
in
his
opinion
in
the
klapprott
case,
emphasized
that
there
had
been
no
trial
of
the
issue
here,
and
he
felt
that
the
defendant
there,
mr.
klapprott,
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
have
a
trial
of
the
issue.
here,
there
was
a
full
trial
of
the
issue.
secondly,
there
was
--
there
is
no
allegation
that
the
petitioner
was
deprived
of
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel,
as
we
suggested
in
the
klapprott
case.
petitioner
was
represented
throughout
these
litigations
by
able
and
experienced
counsel.
these
were
the
same
counsels
who
represented
sweet,
chomiak,
and
charnowola
in
the
contemporary
cases.
these
were
the
same
attorneys
who
represented
nowak
and
maisenberg
in
their
efforts
--
their
successful
efforts
to
reverse
a
denaturalization
judgment.
now,
there
aren't
any
extraordinary
circumstances
here
such
as
illness,
imprisonment,
improper
activities
of
government
officers
or
any
of
these
special
considerations
which
were
involved
in
klapprott
or
were
alleged
in
klapprott
and
to
some
extent
were
alleged
in
ackermann.
indeed,
it
seems
to
me
that
petitioner's
situation
is
hardly
as
advantageous
as
that
of
ackermann
to
whom
this
court
denied
rule
60
(b)
relief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
as
i
said
in
answer
to
mr.
--
the
chief
justice's
question,
discretion
here
may
be
a
relative
term.
i
think
--
i
think
it
is
--
rather
than
--
mr.
charles
gordon
--
discretion,
there
are
certain
standards
which
have
been
established
for
determining
whether
such
a
motion
is
appropriate.
the
standards
are
extraordinary
circumstances
which
in
effect
preclude
a
party
from
presenting
a
defense
or
prosecuting
an
appeal.
this
would
be
my
formulation
rather
than
discretion.
now,
i
don't
think
that
rule
60
(b),
as
contemplated
by
the
decision
in
ackermann
or
klapprott
or
by
the
rule
itself
--
mr.
charles
gordon
under
a
--
mr.
charles
gordon
the
statute,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
my
first
reaction
to
that
sir,
is
that
i
would
say
that
he
should
have
raised
that
at
the
outset.
however,
there
is
a
suggestion
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
if
your
honor
please
we
don't
have
any
question
here
of
a
claim
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
charles
gordon
so,
this
is
something
which
is
speculative.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
--
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
rule
is
not
rigid,
that
the
circumstances
of
the
case
are
controlling,
and
i
say
that
the
circumstances
here
are
nowhere
near
as
acute
as
the
circumstances
--
mr.
charles
gordon
allegedly,
klapprott
recommended.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
in
those
cases,
the
court
denied
rule
60
(b)
relief.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
think
we
agree.
i
think
when
you
call
it
discretion
or
extraordinary
circumstance,
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
circumstance.
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor
stated
completely
what
i
attempted
to
say.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
you
must
find
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
--
you
must
find
extra
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
agree
fully
with
your
honor,
but
extraordinary
circumstances
--
in
determining
whether
there
are
extraordinary
circumstances,
we
have
some
guidelines,
klapprott
and
ackermann.
and,
the
guidelines
are
--
in
those
cases,
are
far
above
what
the
petitioner
here
has
suggested.
in
those
cases,
what
some
people
might
consider
to
be
extraordinary
circumstances
were
regarded
as
not
sufficiently
extraordinary
to
warrant
relief
under
60
(b).
now,
here,
petitioner
doesn't
even
say
"i
was
i'll.
i
was
in
prison.
i
was
without
funds.
the
fbi
agents
improperly
withheld
my
letter
to
my
counsel."
these
were
circumstances
alleged
in
klapprott
and,
in
ackermann,
it
was
thought
by
the
dissenting
judges
that
government
--
the
government
officer
had
improperly
interfered
with
the
individual's
right
of
appeal.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
i
--
i
haven't
said
that
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
know.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
and
i
don't
believe
i've
said
it,
sir.
i
have
said
that
when
a
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
let
me
make
my
point
--
mr.
charles
gordon
my
position
clear.
my
position
is
that
where
a
party
has
defaulted
in
answering
a
complaint
as
in
klapprott
or
in
prosecuting
an
appeal,
as
in
ackermann,
that
default
can
be
relieved
from
under
rule
60
(b)
only
if
he
shows
extraordinary
circumstances
which,
in
effect,
precluded
him
from
interposing
a
defense
or
from
prosecuting
an
appeal.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
that's
right,
whether
he
was
prevented
from
appealing.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
that
is
my
position
sir,
that
rule
60
(b)
says
to
the
individual
“you
have
a
day
in
court.
we
do
not
permit
reopening
of
judgments
after
you
have
already
had
your
opportunity,
unless
you
can
show
that
something
in
the
circumstances
of
the
case
prevented
you
from
urging
your
position,
presented
--
prevented
you
from
prosecuting
the
appeal.”
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
defiance
is
also
a
sort
of
vague
term.
they're
not
exactly
defined.
the
clause
5
and
clause
6
of
rule
60
(b)
are
stated
in
somewhat
expansive
terms.
for
example,
clause
6
says
that
reopening
can
be
granted
for
any
other
reasons
which
justify
the
reopening
of
the
judgment.
but,
in
its
historical
context,
this
rule
was
not
intended
to
authorize
the
reopening
of
any
judgment
merely
because
the
party
thinks,
in
a
later
time,
he
will
get
a
better
break.
it
was
intended
to
provide
for
situations
where
there
was
unfairness
at
the
inception
of
the
original
proceeding,
where,
because
of
this
unfairness,
he,
in
effect,
was
prevented
from
having
his
full
day
in
court.
now,
in
our
estimation,
rule
60
(b)
is
not
a
license
for
everybody
who
is
unhappy
with
his
judgment
to
have
a
second
chance
at
the
court,
or
a
third
chance,
or
a
fourth
chance.
he
has
one
day
in
court.
rule
60
(b)
was
not
intended
to
change
that
rule.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i've
made
that
answer
twice.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
--
i
would
hate
to
be
put
in
the
position
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested
as
conceding
that
rule
60
(b)
gives
to
any
trial
court
the
discretion
in
the
judgment
of
reopening
a
case
when
it
deems
fit.
i
think
rule
60
(b),
in
a
sound
construction,
in
its
historical
context,
in
a
reading
of
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
adopted
applies
only
when
there
was
inequity
in
the
original
proceedings
or
when
some
intervening
fact
later,
like
dissatisfaction
of
a
judgment,
of
the
court's
finding,
or
bankruptcy,
or
conditions
which
make
the
enforcement
of
an
injunction
inequitable
require
that
what
was
originally
a
correct
decree
or
what
was
a
decree
on
the
mind
by
unfairness
should
now
be
reexamined.
mr.
charles
gordon
exactly,
sir,
and
touching
on
your
point
that
this
--
the
question
involved
here
is
broader
than
the
rule
in
denaturalization
cases.
we
have
a
case
pending
on
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
emmetts
against
beard
which
does
not
involve
denaturalization,
in
which
a
similar
effort
to
reopen
a
judgments
based
on
a
subsequent
decision
was
presented
and
rejected
in
which
a
petition
for
certiorari
has
not
been
filed
in
this
court.
the
same
principle
could
apply
in
any
conceiva
--
mr.
charles
gordon
the
name
of
the
case?
mr.
charles
gordon
emmett
against
beard.
mr.
charles
gordon
condemnation.
mr.
charles
gordon
condemnation,
yes,
sir,
in
which
one
party
in
a
condemnation
suit
were
not
appealed,
later,
attempt
to
take
advantage
of
benefits
which
the
persons
who
had
appealed
had
obtained.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
all
depends
on
the
court.
i
hope
to
--
i
would
like
to
say
something
about
the
relevance,
before
i
get
to
the
merits,
of
nowak
and
maisenberg.
the
motion
to
reopen
was
predicated
on
the
supposed
effect
of
this
court's
decisions
in
nowak
and
maisenberg.
now,
if
--
of
course
if
we're
right
on
our
first
point,
if
the
motion
to
reopen
under
circumstances
such
as
these
is
not
appropriate,
then,
of
course,
i
think
there's
nothing
more
to
the
case.
but,
if
the
court
gets
beyond
that,
then
we
think
that
the
motion
is
still
not
sustainable
because
we
believe
that
nowak
and
maisenberg
are
definitely
not
the
same
cases
as
this.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
decisive
considerations,
which
are
present
here
which
were
not
before
the
court,
and
were
not
considered
in
nowak
and
maisenberg.
nowak
and
maisenberg
were
naturalized
in
1938.
the
statute
which
controlled
the
qualifications
for
naturalization
then
was
the
nationality
act
of
1906.
that
statute
had
no
specific
prohibition
against
denaturalization
of
aliens
who
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
nor
did
it
have
a
specific
prohibition
against
denaturalization
of
aliens
who
were
members
of
organizations
which
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
nowak
and
maisenberg
addressed
--
insofar
as
the
finding
of
illegality
is
concerned,
addressed
only
the
statutory
requirement
that
a
petitioner
for
naturalization
must
demonstrate
that
he
is
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
now,
the
court,
in
those
cases,
found
that,
although
there
was
substantial
and
convincing
evidence
that
nowak
and
maisenberg
had
been
members
of
the
communist
party,
although
the
--
there
was
a
finding,
apparently
substantiated
in
the
court's
view,
that
the
communist
party
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
the
lack
of
attachment
which
was
the
basis
of
the
charge
of
illegal
procurement
could
not
be
established
for
the
purposes
of
a
denaturalization
suite,
unless
it
were
shown
that
the
naturalized
person
himself
advocated
or
was
aware
of
the
advocacy
of
those
proscribed
doctrines
by
the
communist
party.
now,
polites
on
the
other
hand
was
naturalized
in
1942.
at
that
time,
the
nationality
act
of
1940
had
become
effective.
the
nationality
act
of
1940
continued
to
former
statute's
requirement
of
attachment
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
however,
the
nationality
act
added
something
new.
it
added
a
specific
and
detailed
prohibition
against
the
naturalization
of
aliens
who
themselves
advocated
or
who
were
members
of
organizations
that
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
this
was
section
305
of
the
nationality
act.
now,
in
the
denaturalization
suite
before
judge
picard
in
1953,
the
government
contended
that
polites
had
been
fraudulently
and
illegally
naturalized.
the
court
found
that
both
charges
were
sustained
and
based
its
judgment
of
denaturalization
on
both.
however,
we
believe
that,
insofar
as
the
charge
of
fraud
is
concerned
or
was
concerned
at
that
time,
this
has
become
doubtful
because
of
this
--
the
court's
later
decisions
in
nowak
and
maisenberg.
now,
we
think
the
resemblance
is
so
great
that
we
do
not
trust
the
charge
of
court
here.
however,
the
denaturalization
decree
also
rested
on
a
finding
that
the
naturalization
had
been
illegally
procured
and
that
was
described
in
judge
picard's
opinion
as
the
primary
charge
on
which
he
rested.
now,
his
finding
of
illegal
procurement
was
based
on
this
sequence
of
proof.
first,
that
polites
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
which
is
not
disputed,
during
the
period
of
1931
to
1938.
this
was
within
the
10-year-period
preceding
the
naturalization.
the
court
also
found
that
the
communist
party
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that,
too,
was
not
disputed
here.
that
finding
is
not
disputed.
and,
then,
on
the
basis
of
these
two
prior
findings,
the
court
found
that,
as
a
member
of
an
organiz
--
organization
advocating
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
polites
was
disqualified
from
naturalization
under
the
explicit
and
direct
terms
of
section
305
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
--
i
don't
rega
--
i
haven't
gotten
to
the
merits
yet,
your
honor.
i
don't
regard
this
as
part
of
the
merits.
i
regard
this
as
the
basis
for
his
soliciting
relief
under
rule
60
(b).
if
it
--
if
that
is
the
type
of
merits
your
honor
has
in
mind,
then
i
think
that
this
was
directly
involved
in
the
order
of
judge
picard.
judge
picard
found
that
nowak
and
maisenberg
were
not
applicable.
you
can
say
the
direct
finding
on
this
and,
therefore,
he
said
that
rule
60
(b)
doesn't
justify
relief.
this
is
one
of
thes
parties.
mr.
charles
gordon
because
this
was
not
the
type
of
situation
that
rule
60
(b)
contemplated.
he
said
both
things,
i
think.
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
he
said
that
he
didn't
find
nowak
and
he
discussed
it.
he
said
i
don't
find
nowak
and
maisenberg
applicable.
i
agree
with
them.
i
think
they
are
not.
now,
section
60
--
305
had
not
yet
been
enacted
at
the
time
nowak
and
maisenberg
were
naturalized.
of
course,
that
section
was
not
before
the
court
in
nowak
and
maisenberg
and
is
not
something
which
the
court
can
be
regarded
as
having
decided.
actually,
the
controlling
precedent
at
that
time
were
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sweet,
chomiak,
and
charnowola
cases
represented
by
the
same
council
in
which
the
court
--
the
three
courts
in
those
cases
and
the
district
court
had
considered
directly
the
applicability
of
section
305
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
considered
the
applicability
of
305
and
in
which
this
court
had
denied
certiorari.
now,
we
believe
that,
in
attempting
to
justify
this
application
under
rule
60
(b),
on
the
basis
of
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
in
nowak
and
maisenberg,
petitioner
is
wrong.
we
think
what
he
actually
is
presenting
here
is
an
entirely
new
question,
not
considered
at
all
in
nowak
and
maisenberg
and
never
before
considered
by
this
court.
and,
that
question
is
whether
section
305,
in
prescribing
for
the
denial
of
naturalization
to
members
of
“subversive
organizations”
is
the
certain
short-hand
term
of
use,
required
that
the
membership
be
with
knowledge
of
the
organization's
proscribed
dates.
now,
we
think
that
this
is
an
issue
which
he
could
have
raised
in
the
original
proceeding
and
actually
did
raise.
it's
been
fully
argued.
this
was
an
issue
that
he
could
have
raised
in
the
appeal
which
he
chose
not
to
pursue.
and
in
our
view,
there
isn't
any
basis
in
rule
60
(b)
or
in
any
other
valid
consideration
which
would
support
his
present
effort
to
renew
the
controversy
which
he
abandoned
five
years
before
his
present
motions.
now,
i
should
like
to
devote
a
few
moment
to
the
ultimate
merits,
if
i
may
use
that
term,
and
that
is
whether,
ultimately,
he
was
properly
denaturalized.
and
this,
of
course
--
this
question
is
reached
only
if
we
are
wrong
on
proposition
(a)
that
this
relief
is
inappropriate,
only
if
we
are
wrong,
i
believe,
on
propositions
(b)
that
nowak
and
maisenberg,
in
our
view,
are
inapplicable
and,
that
is,
attempt
to
reopen
the
proceedings
relying
on
those
decisions
is
supported
by
nowak
and
maisenberg,
but
if
we
are
wrong
on
those
two
assumptions,
then
we
may
perhaps
get
to
the
merits.
now,
the
merits
of
the
case
are,
and
this
was
developed
by
the
testimony,
that
petitioner,
at
the
time
he
applied
for
naturalization,
by
his
own
admission,
was
a
member
or
had
been
a
member
between
1931
and
1938
of
the
communist
party.
during
that
time,
he
had
been
an
active
functionary
of
the
party,
serving
as
secretary
of
the
greek
fraction,
as
a
member
of
the
bureau,
and
in
other
important
capacities
that,
in
1938,
when
he
left
the
party,
he
left
it
only
because
the
party
had
adopted
a
national
policy
that
aliens
should
get
out,
and
had
communicated
that
policy
to
him
and
he
obeyed
the
orders
of
his
superiors
in
the
party.
and,
he
testified
that,
at
the
time
of
his
naturalization
in
1942,
he
still
believed
in
the
aims
and
objectives
of
the
party.
now,
the
record
demonstrates,
in
my
view,
that
this
membership,
i
think
it's
pretty
well
set
forth
in
the
record,
was
meaningful
within
the
contemplation
of
this
court's
decisions
in
the
rowoldt,
galvan,
and
niukkanen
cases
for
the
purposes
of
the
deportation
statute.
it
is
equally
meaningful,
i
think,
for
the
purposes
of
section
305.
this
was
an
active
membership
in
the
ranks
of
the
communist
party.
now,
at
the
trial,
the
government
produced
evidence
through
witnesses
and
documents
that
the
communist
party
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
the
court
found
that
it
was
such
an
organization
and
that
finding
is
not
disputed
here,
as
i
understand
petitioner's
brief.
the
urgent
wish
of
congress
to
bar
naturalization
to
alien
communist
is
underscored
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
305,
which
is
described
in
our
brief.
the
legislative
deliberations
--
throughout
the
legislative
deliberations,
responses
of
this
measure
stated
very
definitely
that
they
were
aiming
this
statute
at
alien
communists.
now,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
and
other
materials
in
its
background,
i
think,
indicate
very
decisively
that
petitioner's
argument,
which
he
has
not
stated
orally
yet
but
which
is
addressed
in
his
brief,
that
section
305
was
aimed
only
at
members
with
personal
knowledge
of
the
organization's
proscribed
aims
or
mem
--
or
persons
who
themselves
advocated
those
prescribed
--
proscribed
documents.
now,
i
think
a
number
of
considerations,
which
i'll
try
to
summarize
briefly,
tell
us
that
congress
certainly
did
not
mean
to
add
such
a
requirement.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
not
even
the
suggestion
of
such
a
requirement
in
the
language
of
section
305.
in
the
second
place,
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that,
at
one
time,
a
proposal
to
include,
to
add
such
a
requirement
of
personal
knowledge
or
advocacy
was
proposed
to
congress
and
that
congress
did
not
adopt
it.
and
third,
your
honors
will
notice
from
reading
section
305
that
it
covers
two
types
of
individuals.
first,
those
who
themselves
advocate
violent
overthrow
and,
second,
those
who
are
members
of
organizations
which
advocate
violent
overthrow.
now,
the
senate
report
on
this
measure
emphasizes
that
congress
intended
to
reach
both
types
of
cases,
both
those
who
themselves
advocated
violent
overthrow
and
those
who
were
members
of
organizations
which
advocated
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
finally,
i
think
it
is
obvious
that
if
congress
intended
that
the
membership
clause
would
require
personal
knowledge,
then
the
second
portion
of
the
statute
was
utterly
meaningless
because,
in
the
first
statute,
it
had
already
dealt
with
persons
who
themselves
believed
in
or
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
now
finally,
your
honors
will
observe
that
the
pertinent
language
of
the
controlling
language,
the
language
which
we
point
here,
of
section
305
are
taken
from
and,
no
doubt
were
taken
deliberately,
from
a
resemble
and
no
doubt
were
taken
from
the
similar
language
of
the
alien
registration
act,
deportation
provisions
of
the
alien
registration
act,
which
had
been
enacted
by
congress
only
four
months
earlier
and,
which
this
court
has
said
in
the
galvan
case,
did
not
contemplate
personal
knowledge
of
the
party's
violent
aims.
now,
we
believe
it
is
highly
in
congress
to
suppose
that,
in
section
305,
congress
intended
to
authorize
denaturalization
of
aliens
whose
deportation
it
had
commanded
in
the
alien
registration
act.
it
seems
to
us
that,
under
the
explicit
terms
and
the
manifest
purpose
of
section
305,
the
petitioner
who
was
admittedly
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
an
organization
bound
by
the
court
and
not
disputed
hereto,
bound
to
have
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
with
those
findings,
petitioner
was
illegally
naturalized
within
the
contemplation
of
section
305
which
made
him
ineligible
to
consider
it.
now,
from
this
conclusion,
if
we
are
correct
in
this
conclusion,
we
think
it
follows
that
his
naturalization
is
subject
to
revocation,
under
section
338
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
as
a
naturalization
which
was
illegally
procured.
now
that
conclusion
i
think
is
supported
by
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
in
the
ginsberg
case,
decided
by
this
court
in
1917
the
court
upheld
a
denaturalization
decree
based
on
illegal
procurement
when
the
individual
had
been
naturalized
in
the
court's
chambers
rather
than
in
open
court
as
the
statute
require.
in
the
ness
and
maney
cases
which
followed,
this
court
upheld
denaturalization
decrees
but
where
there
had
not
been
attached
to
the
petition
for
naturalization
a
certificate
of
lawful
arrival,
which
the
statute
commanded.
now,
in
each
of
those
decisions,
the
ruling
of
this
court
was
unanimous.
although,
later,
the
latter
two
of
these
decisions,
the
opinions
were
delivered
by
justices
brandeis
and
holmes.
we
hardly
think
that
congress
was
more
concerned
with
these
technical
procedural
requirements
than
with
its
vital
interest
in
the
national
security.
and,
with
it,
very
definitely
expressed
desire
to
bar
alien
communists
during
the
time
of
national
crisis
when
the
nationality
act
of
1940
was
enacted.
indeed,
we
think
that,
because
of
its
paramount
and
exclusive
authority
over
naturalization,
it
was
well
within
the
power
of
congress
to
prescribe
for
the
revocation
of
citizenship
which
had
been
illegally
procured.
i
think
this
is
highlighted
by
the
observations
of
this
court
in
the
ginsberg
case,
which
we
have
a
brief
quotation
from
at
page
43
of
our
brief.
there
the
court
says,
“no
alien
has
the
slightest
right
to
naturalization
unless
all
statutory
requirements
are
complied
with,
and
every
certificate
of
naturalization
of
citizenship
must
be
treated
as
granted
upon
condition
that
the
government
may
challenge
it
as
provided
in
section
15
and
demand
its
cancellation,
unless
issued
in
accordance
with
such
requirements,
if
procured
when
prescribed
qualifications
have
no
existence
in
fact,
it
is
illegally
procured
and
subject
to
cancellation.”
now,
we
find
nothing
in
the
schneiderman
or
the
nowak
decisions
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
illegal
procurement
here.
in
schneiderman,
the
court
was
addressing
merely
the
requirement
of
attachment
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution.
the
court
assumed
that
illegal
procurement
would
be
a
valid
basis
for
denaturalization,
but
found
the
proof
inadequate.
in
nowak,
the
court
proceeded
on
like
assumptions.
now,
here,
we
have
breach
of
a
direct
requirement
of
a
statute,
in
section
305,
which
precluded
denaturalization
of
an
alien
who
was
a
member
of
an
organization
devoted
to
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
we
think
that
this
is
precisely
the
type
of
jurisdictional
defect
that
this
court
had
in
mind
in
its
decisions
in
the
ginsberg,
the
ness,
and
the
maney
cases.
moreover,
we
think
it
is
precisely
the
type
of
jurisdictional
requirement
that
was
in
the
mind
of
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
schneiderman
case,
which
we
referred
to
at
page
47
of
our
brief.
now,
i
think
these
observations
are
very
much
in
point.
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
“if
an
anarchist
is
naturalized,
the
united
states
may
bring
an
action
under
section
15
to
set
aside
the
certificate
on
the
ground
of
illegality.”
since
congress,
by
section
7
of
the
act,
forbids
denaturalization
of
anarchist,
the
alien
anarchist
who
obtains
the
certificate
has
procured
it
illegally
whatever
the
naturalization
court
may
find.
the
same
would
be
true
of
communists
if
congress
declared
they
should
be
ineligible
to
citizenship
--
for
citizenship.
then,
proof
that
one
was
not
a
communist
and
did
not
adhere
to
that
party
or
its
belief
would
become,
like
other
expressed
conditions
of
the
act,
a
so-called
jurisdictional
fact
upon
which
they
grant
this
revocation.
we
hold
with
mr.
justice
douglas
that
where
there
is
omission
to
comply
with
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
the
requirement
specifically
required
by
congress,
prescribed
by
congress,
there
is
an
invalid
naturalization
within
the
contemplation
of
section
338
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940.
here,
we
have
such
a
specific
jurisdictional
requirement
in
section
305
which
declared,
“no
alien
shall
hereafter
be
naturalized
who
belongs
to
the
one
of
the
organizations
described
in
the
statute.”
we
think
that,
since
there
has
been
a
violation
of
such
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
denaturalization
was
illegally
procured
and
was,
therefore,
subject
to
revocation.
in
our
view,
judge
picard
was
clearly
right
in
1953
when
he
found
that
this
naturalization
in
1942
had
been
illegally
procured,
and
when
he
cancelled
polites'
citizenship.
we
believe,
therefore,
that
the
attack
on
the
ultimate
merits
must
fail.
in
our
view,
the
judgments
reop
--
refusing
to
reopen
the
1953
judgment
is
clearly
correct,
and
we
urge
that
it
would
be
affirmed.
