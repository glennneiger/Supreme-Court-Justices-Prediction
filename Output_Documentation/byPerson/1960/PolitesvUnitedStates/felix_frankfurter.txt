justice

frankfurter
are
you
really
ready
to
say
that
you're
not
familiar
with
the
fact
that
this
court
had
frequently,
after
it
has
denied
certiorari,
taken
up
a
question
and
reversed
what
was
better
for
the
rulings
of
the
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
even
dismissed
as
wanting
--
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question
in
a
succession
of
cases
and
then
dramatically
reversed
on
--
on
a
consideration
of
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
really
don't
mean
to
say
that,
mr.
crockett.
you
leave
it
to
the
lawyers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
each
case
pre
--
may
present
a
separate
state
of
fact
and
not
all
--
this
wasn't
a
case
of
--
where
all
presented
the
same
simple,
lucid,
unembarrassed
question
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
denaturalization
cases
don't
all
fall
under
the
same
pattern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
take
--
i
wasn't
defending
the
court.
i
was
defending
your
ability
as
a
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gordon,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
sunal
case
was
decided
before
this
court
that
so
unequivocally
laid
down
the
rule
in
garr
against
griffith
as
to
the
legal
non-significant,
in
any
sense
of
the
merit,
of
a
denial
of
certiorari.
at
the
time
of
sunal,
it
wasn't
at
all
clear
what
this
court
would
do
when
there's
a
concession
of
denial
and
there
was
much
more
reason
at
the
time
of
sunal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
darren
griffin,
in
relying
on
denial
of
certiorari,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
that,
in
sunal,
a
man
was
kept
in
jail
simply
because
his
counsel
had
relied
on
what
he
thought
he
had
a
right
to
rely
on,
namely,
clear
contrary
rulings
which
were
never
taken
by
this
court,
merely
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
effect
and
why
you
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
sunal
decided,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
reason
was
that
he
had
every
right
to
rely
that
there
would
consistent
decisions.
it
would
be
a
futile
thing
for
him
to
spend
time,
money,
and
hopeless
hope
in
trying
to
get
a
contrary
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
my
observation,
in
the
course
of
all
these
years,
that
counsels
of
the
united
states
are
rather
timid
about
filing
petitions
for
certiorari,
particularly
in
causes
that
they
think
worthy
that
alone
in
all
the
frivolous
cases
in
which
petitions
apply
to
this
court.
i
don't
find
its
submissiveness
on
the
part
of
the
bar
the
intimation
that
they're
going
to
move
a
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
the
difference
in
your
second
and
third,
and
third
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
second?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
like
what
you're
doing?
given
the
fact
that
i'm
a
dissenter
in
ackermann,
i
think
i
--
if
we
try
to
understand
what
that
case
held,
even
that
case
of
klapprott
said
that
â€œwe
leave
it
to
the
individual
judgment
of
the
judge
and,
if
he
is
a
kindhearted
man,
he
will
grant
it
and,
if
he's
not
a
kindhearted
man,
he
won't
grant
it.
there
were
certain
criteria
for
exercising
discretion,
so-called,
and
not
the
individual
predisposition
or
tenderness
or
severity,
this
judgment
or
that
judgment,
about
finality.
one
judge
thinks
finality
is
important.
he
will
say
no
and
the
judgment
who
thinks
it's
not
important
we
would
say
yes.
that
isn't
what
klapprott
or
ackermann
decided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gordon,
you
have
a
long
white
note
to
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
department
but
you're
here
as
a
representative
of
the
department
of
justice
dealing
with
a
problem
arising
under
60
(b).
the
problem,
under
that
section
they
arise,
not
touching
immigration
services
at
all,
touching
all
sorts
of
claims,
fraud,
an
inequity,
a
misconduct
of
all
sorts.
and,
presumably,
a
case
like
this,
and
was
true
of
ackermann
and
klapprott,
lays
down
certain
considerations,
criteria,
call
them
what
you
will,
guidelines,
but
district
judges
will
have
to
deal
with
these
problems
everyday
and
we
have
to
tell
them
how
they
are
to
decide
these
cases.
and,
in
ackermann
and
in
klapprott,
this
court
laid
down
certain
standards,
not
a
36
inches
constitute
a
yard,
not
a
mechanic
thing,
and
not
a
scaling
stick
and
weigh
it,
16
ounces
and
not
18
ounces,
but
the
general
consideration
by
which
judges
are
to
be
governed.
and,
klapprott
and
ackerman,
particularly
ackermann,
said
the
circumstances
in
that
case
did
not
warrant
resort
to
60
(b).
and,
what
i
understand
to
be
your
argument
is
that
the
considerations
here
are
far
less
lenient
for
exercising
authority
under
60
(b)
than
they
were
in
ackermann.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
it
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
do
you
think
--
why
do
you
find
conflict
in
those
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
part
of
the
government
put
your
client
to
do
it
particularly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
should
i
make
any
quick
assumption?
since
you
had
a
--
since
he
had
a
very
able
knowledge
of
a
counsel
who
told
him
that,
under
the
law,
it
was
not
erroneous.
