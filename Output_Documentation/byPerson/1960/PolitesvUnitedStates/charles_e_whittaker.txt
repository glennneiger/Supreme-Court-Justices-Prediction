whittaker
in
other
words,
as
i
understand
you
are
agreeing
to
the
fact
that
rule
60
(b)
should
not
fall
around
delay
in
motions
to
re-file
but
rather
allow
reopen
upon
defined
condition
set
out
in
the
rule.
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
agree
ackermann,
as
mr.
crockett
does,
that
involving
only
discretion
is
not
power?
