mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
one
qualification
as
interpreted
by
this
court's
decision
in
texas
&
pacific
case
requiring
a
carrier
to
cease
undue
preference
and
prejudice
whether
it's
within
the
united
states
entirely
or
whether
a
part
of
it
involves
international
traffic,
the
carrier
must
be
aloud
the
choice
as
to
whether
it's
going
to
eliminate
the
preference
by
moving
one
rate
up
or
the
other
down.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
only
on
carriers
operating
within
the
united
states.
we
agree
entirely
with
the
argument
which
the
department
of
justice
has
made
and
the
section
31
point,
preference
and
prejudice.
first,
i'd
like
to
comment
briefly
upon
the
suggestion
of
the
department
of
justice
that
the
issue
of
the
railroads'
liability
of
reparations
under
section
1
of
the
act
was
not
properly
before
the
district
court
or
before
this
court.
it
is
suggested
that
that
issue
is
not
just
justiciable
until
the
commission
issues
a
final
dollars
and
cents
reparation
order.
and
--
and
on
the
theory
that
when
such
an
order
is
finally
issued
and
if
the
railroads
do
not
voluntarily
obey
it
and
pay
then
at
that
point
under
section
16
of
the
act,
the
shippers
may
maintain
a
suit
on
that
order.
i
don't
deny
the
logic
of
the
suggestion.
however,
we
are
inclined
to
believe
that
this
court
need
not
accept
the
suggestion,
that
for
practical
reasons,
it
could
take
a
contrary
view.
to
begin
with,
a
determination
of
liability
as
distinguished
from
the
computation
of
damages
has
been
held
to
be
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
something
which
the
courts
can
determine
separately
from
the
computation
of
damages.
now
moreover,
since
the
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
preference
and
prejudice
and
is
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates,
arises
out
of
the
same
transportation
problem,
it
seems
to
us
unfortunate
that
the
two
questions
of
jurisdiction
arising
out
of
the
same
transportation
situation
would
have
to
be
litigated
separately
by
the
parties
by
separate
routes.
if
both
questions
are
now
resolved,
there
would
remain
for
any
court
in
which
a
suit
was
brought
on
a
reparations
order,
the
detail
questions
as
to
whether
the
reparation
for
--
are
accurately
computed,
whether
the
responsibility
for
particular
shipments
were
assigned
against
the
--
the
carriers
that
were
truly
participated
in
the
shipments.
if
the
court
should
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
the
united
states,
then
we
have
a
further
concern
as
they
do.
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
while
disclaiming
authority
to
consider
the
validity
of
reparation
orders
is
entirely
devoted
to
discussion
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates
which
is
the
very
jurisdictional
issue
which
would
underlie
in
a
subsequent
reparations
order.
so
we
would
urge
that
if
this
court
should
agree
with
the
suggestion
of
the
department
of
justice
then
it
should
vacate
the
decision
below
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
rates.
so
that
in
any
suit
which
may
later
be
brought
by
these
shippers
on
any
future
reparations
order
issued
by
the
commission,
they
will
not
then
be
cut
off
by
a
res
judicata
effect
of
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court.
assuming
that
your
honors
will
hold
that
the
issue
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
as
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates
is
properly
before
this
court,
we
contend
the
contrary
to
the
court
below
that
the
commission
did
have
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
the
through
combination
rates
from
the
canadian
origins
in
this
case
to
the
southern
destination
points
were
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
that
the
shippers
were
therefore
entitled
to
reparations.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
not
on
this
record.
reparations
maybe
had
for
discrimination,
for
undue
preference
and
prejudice.
that
takes
a
different
type
of
proof,
a
heavy
burden
of
proof,
a
different
burden
of
proof
than
is
involved
in
getting
reparations
based
upon
the
unreasonableness
of
the
rates.
and
in
--
and
on
this
record
in
this
case,
the
--
the
commission's
finding
that
the
railroads
were
reliable
for
reparations
was
based
entirely
upon
its
conclusion
that
the
rates
were
unreasonable.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
and
as
i
will
get
to
later
in
my
argument,
we
would
require
that
canadian
carriers
to
absorb
somewhat
to
the
extent
that
they
perform
transportation
service
within
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
on
the
other
hand,
these
carriers,
canadian
and
the
official
territory
american
carriers,
they're
dealing
together
all
the
time,
establishment
of
joint
rates
divisions
and
so
on.
if
the
--
if
the
canadian
segment
of
rate
is
just
outrageously
high,
the
traffic
isn't
going
to
move
on
particular
routes,
that's
all
and
there
won't
be
a
thing
we
can
do
about
it
but
of
course
the
canadian
commission
has
jurisdiction
at
that
point.
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they're
anymore
indifferent
to
the
interest
of
--
of
shippers
than
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is.
we
can
leave
that
to
them
i
suggest.
now,
the
rates
in
question
consist
of
two
factors.
this
cut
through
combination
rate
consists
of
two
factors,
a
so-called
proportional
rate
applicable
only
on
the
through
traffic,
established
by
the
canadian
lines
from
the
canadian
mines,
the
origins,
to
east
alburgh
and
newport
in
vermont.
and
the
second
factor
of
this
combination
rate,
are
the
various
classes
or
joint
commodity
rates
which
the
american
carriers
have
established
from
east
alburgh
and
newport
to
the
southern
destinations,
mostly
in
north
and
south
carolina.
east
alburgh
is
three
miles
south
of
the
border.
newport
is
five
miles
south
of
the
border.
the
canadian
lines
here
involved
run
into
east
--
east
alburgh
and
newport
where
they
physically
interchange
traffic.
now
the
act
for
--
section
1
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
specifically
provides
that
it
applies
to
international
rail
traffic
but
only
insofar
as
such
transportation
takes
place
within
the
united
states.
now,
in
this
case
the
shippers
attacked
the
entire
through
combination
rate
as
unreasonable.
they
did
not
attack
the
factor
consisting
of
the
rates
from
alburgh
and
newport
to
the
south.
now,
the
appellee
railroads
raise
only
a
question
of
jurisdiction.
they
contend
that
they
publish
rates
from
the
boundary
to
the
south,
that's
the
american
railroads,
and
that
these
rates
are
not
attacked.
and
they
contend
that
the
proportional
rates
of
the
canadian
lines,
the
other
factor
in
the
combination
rate,
are
not
subject
to
the
american
commission's
jurisdiction.
the
commission
rejected
the
--
the
railroads'
contention
that
they
had
published
rates
to
the
boundary.
noting
the
newport
and
alburgh
were
three
and
five
miles
south
of
the
boundary
respectively,
the
commission
held
or
they
had
found
that
the
proportional
rates
maintained
by
the
canadian
lines
to
these
points,
that's
alburgh
and
newport,
obligate
those
carriers
to
provide
substantial
transportation
service
within
the
united
states.
now,
it's
undisputed
that
canadian
railroad
performing
transportation
service
within
the
united
states
is
just
as
much
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
--
as
an
american
railroad
is
or
the
same
as
an
american
railroad
performing
service
in
canada
is
subject
to
canadian
law.
however,
the
railroads
contend
that
as
a
practical
matter,
east
alburgh
and
newport
should
be
considered
as
border
points
because
they
were
right
on
the
canadian-american
border.
and
the
court
below
agreed
with
us.
it
said,
“surely
the
fact
that
interchange
occurs
a
few
miles
on
one
side
of
the
boundary
instead
of
the
few
miles
in
the
other
side
is
a
fortuitous
event
on
which
congress
could
not
have
intended
that
the
commission's
jurisdiction
should
depend.”
now,
we
admit
that
government
regulation
around
an
international
boundary,
in
fact
all
sorts
of
business
around
an
international
boundary,
is
a
technical
business.
it
involves
arbitrary
lines.
now,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
routinely
treated
as
border
points
such
places
as
detroit,
port
huron,
nogales
on
the
mexican
border
which
in
fact
are
right
adjacent
to
the
border.
we
haven't
taken
the
position
that
that
the
border
at
detroit
is
the
middle
of
the
detroit
river.
we
have
assumed
that
detroit
right
on
the
boundary
river
is
a
boundary
point,
but
a
line
must
be
draw
--
applied
somewhere.
there
comes
a
point
at
which
the
interstate
commerce
act
must
be
applied
with
canadian
carriers
operating
within
the
united
states.
for
reasons
of
topography
or
operating
convenience,
those
interchange
points
theoretically
might
be
10
or
15
miles
south
of
the
border
and
as
an
operating
matter
as
a
commercial
matter
that
might
be
perfectly
bona
fide.
no
element
of
evasion
involved.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
certainly
and
--
and
that's
why
we
treat
port
huron
and
nogales,
detroit
as
being
border
points,
but
some,
as
i
said
at
some
point
of
distance,
the
act
should
be
applied.
now,
we
have
--
we
have
assumed
--
we
assumed
that
that
--
that
it
is
proper
for
the
commission
to
apply
some
flexibility
and
treat
as
border
points
those
points
that
are
on
--
right
adjacent
to
it
as
on
a
boundary
limit.
but
we
submit
that
the
commission
is
not
under
on
any
obligation
to
treat
as
border
points
other
interchange
points,
three
to
five
miles
inside
united
states
and
if
those
canadian
lines
coming
down
to
alport
--
alburgh
and
newport,
are
not
regarded
as
performing
transportation
within
the
united
states
so
as
to
be
subject
to
the
act,
then
i
suppose
tomorrow
they
can
take
up
the
tracks
they
can
sell
it,
they
can
scrap
it.
well,
that
thought
was
too
much
for
the
court
below.
the
court
below
said,
“if
for
example
the
canadian
carriers
sought
to
abandon
interchange
service
between
the
interchange
points
of
the
border
or
if
they
sought
to
lease
their
trackage
in
the
united
states
to
another
carrier,
the
commission
would
clearly
have
jurisdiction.
we
agree.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
take
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
the
tariffs
here
involved
for
example,
are
on
the
file
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
they
have
an
agent
within
the
united
states.
suppose
they
try
to
abandon
and
scrap
the
lines
out
there.
we
can
go
to
a
court
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
--
we
can
ask
a
federal
court.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
for
all
tariff
purposes,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
for
all
tariff
purposes,
yes,
but
suppose
they
--
they
seek
to
abandon
and
scrap
that
three
or
five-mile
segment
o
f
line,
we
can
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
directed
to
the
quebec
central
railroad
and
--
and
in
any
--
in
any
agents
who
are
trying
to
tariff
the
tracks.
i
don't
think
we'd
have
any
trouble
preventing
the
removal
of
the
tracks.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
practical
problem
and
here
as
the
court
below
conceded
their
subject
--
their
jurisdiction
of
the
act
for
the
purpose
of
regulation
of
abandonments
and
leasing,
seems
to
us
the
same
jurisdiction
as
applicable
for
rate
purposes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
because
the
jurisdictional
provision
in
--
in
section
1,
paragraph
1
is
the
same.
foreign
transportation
--
international
rail
transportation
insofar
as
it
takes
place
within
the
united
states.
the
abandonment
--
the
abandonment
and
leasing
limitations
are
applicable
only
to
carriers
and
transportation
subject
to
our
jurisdiction.
and
the
court
below
didn't
dispute
that.
it
really
said
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
rate
jurisdiction
well
in
terms
of
the
distance
of
these
interchange
points
in
the
border,
it's
de
minimus
and
we
submit
that
the
problems
of
national
jurisdiction
should
--
can
be
treated
de
minimus
only
very
carefully.
they
say
the
shippers'
complaint
--
well,
i'm
ahead
of
myself,
that
the
court
agrees
with
us
contrary
to
the
court
below
and
the
situation
for
rate
purposes
is
this.
the
united
states
lines
have
established
rates
not
to
the
border
but
to
points
in
the
united
states
south
of
the
border.
and
the
other
element
of
the
challenged
combination
rate
is
the
proportional
rate
established
by
the
canadian
lines
from
origin
points
in
canada
to
points
in
the
united
states.
we
argue
that
thus,
both
the
united
states
and
the
canadian
lines
have
performed
transportation
subject
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
it's
is
another
way
of
saying
that
both
elements
of
that
through
combination
rate
had
been
applied
to
transportation
taking
place
within
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
i
say
the,
shipper's
complaint,
leading
right
into
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
challenged
the
entire
combination
rate.
that
was
required
as
we
see
it
by
this
court's
decision
in
the
sullivan
case
and
the
sullivan
case
involved
international
traffic
between
canada
and
the
united
states.
there
were
two
rate
factors.
one
was
a
proportional
rate
established
by
the
canadian
carriers
to
the
border.
the
other
was
another
proportional
rate
established
by
the
american
carriers
up
to
the
border.
when
an
american
shipper
tried
to
attack
just
the
american
proportion
that
--
the
proportional
rate
established
by
the
american
railroads,
this
court
said
no,
that
a
shipper
seeking
reparations
must
show
that
the
entire
through
charge
is
unlawful,
unreasonable.
this
court
analogized
that
the
proportional
rates
in
that
case,
even
though
they
were
separately
established
by
the
participating
carriers
as
local
rates,
this
court
analogized
those
proportionals
to
joint
rates
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
logic
of
the
sullivan
decision
clearly
goes
further.
that
there
is
no
difference
between
separately
established
proportional
rates
which
make
up
a
through
rate
as
in
that
case
or
separately
established
local
rates
which
are
used
to
do
--
make
a
through
combination
rate.
it's
a
combination
rate
whether
it's
separately
established
proportional
rates
or
separately
established
local
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
we
must,
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
great
northern
railroad
company
v.
sullivan,
294
u.s.
458.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
now,
if
the
rates
break
right
on
the
border
in
true
sense,
under
the
sullivan
case,
before
awarding
reparations,
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
entire
through
rate,
but
the
--
but
the
liability
would
be
limited
to
the
canadian
--
to
the
american
carriers
for
their
portion
of
the
transportation
up
to
the
border.
we'd
have
to
look
at
the
entire
rate
but
our
jurisdiction
to
impose
liability
would
be
limited
to
the
american
carriers
that
had
established
a
rate
right
up
to
the
border.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
--
as
in
the
sullivan
case.
there
the
--
there
the
rates
either
broke
on
border
points
or
as
the
tariff
in
that
case
showed
at
the
international
border
near
such
and
such
town.
both
the
shippers'
complaint
and
the
commission's
finding
that
the
shippers
are
entitled
reparation
ran
against
the
united
states
and
the
canadian
lines
who
had
participated
in
this
transaction,
this
transportation
from
the
canadian
origins
to
southern
destinations.
the
appellants
contend,
and
the
decision
below
seems
to
suggest
that
the
united
states
lines
which
established
rates
up
to
alburgh
and
newport
cannot
be
held
responsible
for
an
unlawful
through
combination
rate
which
includes
as
one
of
its
factors,
the
proportional
rate
applied
by
the
canadian
lines
in
alburgh
and
newport
north.
in
other
words,
they're
suggesting
that
the
joint
and
--
they
admitted
joint
and
severed
liability
of
the
participants
in
a
joint
rate,
cannot
be
applied
to
the
participants
in
a
combination
rate.
we
think
this
court
held
to
the
contrary
in
the
sullivan
case.
in
addition,
both
the
commission
and
the
lower
federal
courts
have
applied
joint
and
severed
responsibility
for
the
railroads
participating
in
the
combination
rate
composed
of
factors
which
were
separately
established
by
the
participating
carriers.
that
principle
is
very
well
summarized,
we
believe,
in
the
atlantic
&
yadkin
railroad
company
case
in
opinion
by
judge
parker
which
is
set
--
quoted
from
--
in
our
brief
at
pages
42
and
44.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
was
a
combination,
it's
a
strange
thing.
it
was
a
combination
rate
consisting
of
two
proportions,
separately
established
proportions.
all
or
--
all
the
phrase
“proportional”
there
means
they
were
just
--
they
were
used
with
each
other
on
through
traffic.
they
weren't
available
to
local
traffic
in
canada
or
to
local
traffic
in
this
country.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it
sounds
like
a
joint
rate
--
rate
but
it
wasn't
the
--
it
wasn't
the
result
of
express
agreement
with
a
later
division.
each
established
its
own
proportional
and
in
that
sense,
it
was
separately
established
as
the
local
rates
going
into
a
combination
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
sullivan
case?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
the
sullivan
case,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
it's
normal
only
in
this
instance.
proportional
rates
typically
are
available
only
through
traffic.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
traffic
moving
goes
through
the
interchange
point.
it
would
not
be
available
on
traffic,
say,
in
the
east
alburgh,
destined
for
the
east
alburgh
or
starting
from
east
alburgh
and
in
the
sullivan
case
for
example,
there
were
two
proportionals,
each
separately
established
by
the
participating
carriers
for
their
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
of
the
combination
rate
just
as
much
a
combination
rate
as
--
as
though
that
--
that
there
were
two
local
rates
used
to
comprise
the
combination
rate.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
it
governs
the
applicability
of
the
rate,
whether
it's
applicable
to
local
traffic
or
to
through
traffic
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
sir,
it's
as
much
a
combination
rate
whether
it's
made
up
of
two
--
proportions
--
proportional
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right,
only
for
through
traffic,
going
through
both
segments.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no,
it's
--
it's
used
to
--
to
distinguish
a
rate
applicable
on
through
traffic
as
distinguished
of
any
local
rates
which
might
be
--
which
might
be
in
the
--
in
the
published
tariffs.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
into
our
relationship
with
the
canadian
commission?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
one
cannot
reconcile
all
the
commission's
decisions
through
the
40-year
period.
the
great
bulk
on
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
could
pinpoint
it
that
way.
may
i
answer
you
in
--
at
least
in
part
this
way?
the
great
bulk
of
the
cases
on
which
the
railroads
rely
are
cases
involving
detroit,
port
huron,
nogales,
buffalo
and
other
towns
or
cities
right
on
the
border
--
right
on
the
border's
grid
which
the
commission
as
routinely
treated
as
being
border
points.
most
of
the
cases
fall
in
that
category.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
three
miles.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
three
or
three
and
a
half
miles.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
one
--
the
one
in
which
you
rely
is
most
heavily.
not
all
of
the
decisions
through
40
years
can
be
entirely
reconciled.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
is
mistaken.
he
is
citing
that
if
the
complaint
were
rewritten
that
the
--
the
shippers
could
make
a
comparison
of
a
local
rate
from
the
boundary
--
from
the
boundary
down
to
the
southern
territories
by
comparing
that
with
the
rate
to
the
official
territory.
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
such
a
comparison.
the
rate
to
the
points
on
official
territories
is
a
joint
through
--
joint
rate
from
the
canadian
origins
to
the
destination
points
and
official
territory.
we
don't
know
how
it
would
be
broken
down
at
the
american
boundary.
he
would
have
you
compare,
he
would
say
if
the
shippers
to
try
to
show
discrimination
between
a
rate
from
the
boundary
to
the
south
with
of
a
--
with
a
joint
rate
from
the
canadian
origins
all
the
way
through
to
the
official
territory
of
origin.
it
can't
be
done.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
you
can't
compare
one
segment
of
one
through
rate
with
an
entire
joint
rate
to
the
official
territory
and
he
knows
it.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
such
a
comparison
can
be
effectively
made
in
terms
of
the
problems
of
proof
and
evidence
only
by
comparing
the
whole
group.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
they
have
no
breakdown
as
to
how
much
of
that
was
attributable
to
the
transportation
in
the
united
states
to
the
points
on
official
territory.
we
might
not
even
know
what
the
division
was
as
between
the
carriers
even
though
--
even
if
that
were
relevant.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
afraid
we'll
be
comparing
such
unlike
that
it
would
be
almost
meaningless
either
for
or
against
the
carrier.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
yellow
jacket
case
says
that
where
the
--
that
where
american
carrier's
rate,
the
local
rate,
is
fixed
to
the
boundary,
to
the
border,
not
just
at
some
point
in
them
--
in
--
in
the
country.
in
that
case,
it
involved
detroit
and
i
think
port
huron.
american
carriers
local
rate
goes
to
the
--
right
up
to
the
boundary,
then
the
shipper
may
attack
just
the
american
segment
of
the
rate.
he
may
do
so
and
perhaps
the
--
perhaps
the
commission
was
straining
too
hard
there
to
--
to
help
the
shipper.
thank
you.
