the
issue
is
in
both
cases,
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
case
and
in
the
case
in
which
you're
arguing,
they're
the
same,
are
they
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
a
different
point
of
view,
of
you
and
the
commission,
i
thought.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
practical
reason
for
that?
is
there
no
point
at
the
border
where
they
can
exchange?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
the
--
the
bona
fides
of
this
exchange
is
not
an
issue
here
anyway,
in
the
selection
of
this
point
within
the
united
states?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
see
that
factual
situation
now
to
all
states.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
sullivan
case
is
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
can
we
do
that
under
the
sullivan
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
on
your
theory
as
to
how
it
is
pledged
that
have
been
drawn,
wouldn't
that
necessarily
involve
the
shipper
to
prove
that
you
might
be
--
american
factor
is
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
maybe
the
unreasonable
part
of
it
in
here
is
entirely
in
the
rest
of
the
provision,
the
statute
itself.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible),
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
why
the
sullivan
case
makes
pretty
good
sense?
justice
john
m.
harlan
