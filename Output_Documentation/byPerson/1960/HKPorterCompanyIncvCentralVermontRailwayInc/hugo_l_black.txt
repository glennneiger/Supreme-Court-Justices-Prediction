what
page
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
272.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
explain
to
me,
i
don't
quite
understand
it
yet.
the
language
that
i
can
get
forgetting
that
their
--
just
forget
now
that
there's
anything
named
joint
through
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
forget
that,
what
is
the
prejudicial
claim
and
what
acts
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
gets
the
money
for
the
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
divide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
our
railroads
have
agreed
with
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
canadian
railroad.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
rate
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
have
whatever
you
call
it
or
--
as
i
understand
it,
a
rate
from
canada
to
pennsylvania
which
is
less
than
the
rate
from
canada
to
north
carolina.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
because
they
fixed
it
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
it
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
it
can
have
all
but
it
does
not
have
power
to
do
that,
outlaw
discrimination
brought
about
to
--
by
joint
rate
which
is
voluntarily
in
the
district.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
before
your
argument
goes
to
find
to
myself?
assuming
that
the
court
--
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
to
relieve
against
rates
that
are
discriminatory,
large
numbers
of
sections
in
the
country,
is
there
any
relief
that
a
shipper
could
get?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
it's
perfectly
reasonable
and
that
a
lower
rate
is
reasonable,
that
--
that
is
on
the
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that
a
discrimination
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
favored
one
section
of
some
shippers
of
against
another.
the
part
of
it
isn't
--
is
a
--
it's
a
segment
of
a
through
rate
from
canada.
what's
the
relief
there
if
it's
discriminatory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
these
through
rates
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you've
been
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
through
rates
had
been
made
from
inside
the
border
to
southern
and
official
territory
and
with
the
same
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
commission
--
could
the
commission
have
forbidden
the
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
get
it
(voice
overlap)
if
--
if
--
then
you
have
to
say
that
even
though
they
could
if
they
--
they
combined
with
the
railroad
in
canada,
the
result
of
which
is
precisely
the
same
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
in
north
carolina
would
be
having
to
pay
considerably
more
than
the
official
territory
on
a
line
on
a
trip
and
most
of
it
was
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
--
suppose
you
--
suppose
they
had
amended
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
had
--
could
they
have
amended
it
and
proceeded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
amended
--
amended
to
say
what
you
say
it
should've
said?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
that
be
jurisdictional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
your
argument
be
of
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
whether
--
whether
the
canadian
railroad
charged
more
for
goods
that
were
ultimately
to
be
shipped
to
north
carolina
than
it
did
for
carrying
goods
that
were
ultimately
to
be
shipped
to
pennsylvania?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is
that
the
record
indicates
that
it
cost,
the
canadian
railroad
and
the
a
motor
transport
goods
that
was
going
to
--
going
to
north
carolina,
than
to
transport
goods
if
they're
going
to
pennsylvania.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
anything
that
indicated
whether
they
actually
got
less
for
that
part
of
the
leg
of
the
journey
because
it
was
shipped
to
one
place
in
this
country
rather
than
another?
