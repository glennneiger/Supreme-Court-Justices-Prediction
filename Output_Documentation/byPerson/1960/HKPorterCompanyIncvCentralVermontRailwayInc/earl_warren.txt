chief

we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
finding
that
it
is
discriminatory
from
our
border
to
the
south
as
compared
with
the
--
to
the
trip
from
our
border
to
pennsylvania?
chief

mr.
mcdonald.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
off
there,
if
there
--
if
there
is
no
difference
in
--
the
canadian
rates
to
our
border,
what
are
we
--
what
are
we
fighting
about?
what
is
the
difference
between
you
and
--
and
them?
isn't
the
whole
thing
determined,
the
whole
differential
determined
by
what
the
--
the
railroads
in
this
country
do
with
those
shipments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
my
point,
is
this,
i
--
i
should
understand
it,
i'm
sure
by
now
but
i
don't.
suppose
on
--
on
shipment
--
one
shipment
to
pennsylvania
and
one
to
north
carolina
cost
x
dollars
to
--
to
transport
it
from
the
--
from
the
mine
in
canada
to
the
american
border.
now,
on
the
--
on
the
one
to
the
shipment
to
north
carolina,
it
cost
x
dollars
to
shipment
to
--
to
ship
to
the
border.
now,
what
are
we
fighting
about?
aren't
we
fighting
about
what
you
say
is
--
is
the
proper
thing
to
fight
about
what
the
american
railroads
have
done
in
connection
with
these
rates?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
can
--
we'll
assume
that
but
i
still
--
i
--
i
still
don't
understand
the
situation.
let's
--
let's
assume
--
well,
i'll
start
this.
we're
fighting
over
dollars
here
aren't
we?
dollars
to
--
to
the
railroad
that
and
--
and
to
the
shippers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
--
just
a
question
of
economics?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
take
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
take
dollar
wise.
if
--
if
this
mine
was
right
at
the
border,
right
at
these
towns
where
--
where
the
exchange
point
in
--
in
vermont
and
you
were
transporting
in
one
shipment
to
pennsylvania
and
another
one
to
charlotte,
north
carolina,
would
you
be
in
any
different
financial
position
than
you
--
than
you
are
now
granting
that
it
cost
x
dollars
to
get
from
the
present
mine
in
--
in
canada
for
either
shipment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
i
under
--
and
did
i
understand
you
to
correct
me
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
to
say,
“if
--
if
the
court
does
have
--
if
it
does
not
have
jurisdiction,
of
course
the
government
loses?”
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
does
have
jurisdiction,
you
lose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
purely
and
simply
a
question
of
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
think
your
time
has
--
has
expired.
did
you
have
a
question
to
ask,
mr.
ginnane
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
time,
yes,
you
may.
would
you
answer
the
question
please,
mr.
ginnane.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
