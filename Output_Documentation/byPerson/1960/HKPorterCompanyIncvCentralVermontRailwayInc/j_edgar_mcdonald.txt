mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
members
of
this
honorable
court.
i
hope
i
can
do
something
to
clarify
what
i
think
is
the
very
simple
issues
before
this
court
and
if
i
may
say
so
at
the
outset
without
the
slightest
disrespect
to
either
of
my
distinguished
opponents,
i'm
amazed
that
neither
the
department
of
justice
nor
the
commission
has
seen
fit
to
face
up
to
what
we
say
is
the
very,
very
simple
issue
that
requires
determination
one
way
or
the
other
by
this
court,
which
we
think
was
determined
by
the
three-judge
district
court.
and
that
is
this
question
of
jurisdiction
and
whether
it
must
be
said
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
a
rate
applies
to
the
actual
international
boundary
line
or
whether
the
boundary
line
for
practical
purposes
of
rate
making
maybe
regarded
as
some
distance
away
from
the
exact
international
boundary
line.
and
because
of
our
thinking
on
that
point,
we
say
that
the
issue
here
is
a
simple
one.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
either
had
jurisdiction
over
these
complaints
and
the
right
to
determine
among
the
basis
of
recognized
principles
which
it's
--
usually
applies
in
the
conventional
cases
before
it
or
it
did
not,
in
which
event
the
complaints
were
defective
on
their
respective
faces
and
should
have
been
dismissed
forthwith.
now,
that's
the
simple
position
that
we
have
taken
since
the
first
complaint
was
filed
a
number
of
years
ago.
it's
the
position
we
adhered
to
when
four
additional
complaints
were
filed.
it's
the
position
we
adhered
to
in
our
efforts
to
have
the
case
reconsidered
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
at
the
position
that
we,
i'm
glad
to
say,
adhered
to
successfully
before
the
three-judge
court.
now,
i
think
it
helps
considerably
to
or
should
help
considerably
to
this
court's
consideration
of
this
matter,
if
i
undertook
to
talk
a
minute
about
the
nature
of
the
rates
involved
and
what
i
understand
to
be
the
court's
prior
dealing
with
jurisdictional
matters
affecting
international
traffic.
now,
first
of
all,
as
you've
already
heard,
there
are
such
things
as
joint
rates.
a
rate
that
applies
as
a
single
entity
from
a
point
of
origin
regardless
of
whether
it's
in
a
foreign
country
or
this
country
to
a
destination
regardless
of
where
it
is.
in
any
event,
it's
a
single
entity,
one
rate,
one
factor
which
applies
and
is
made
in
the
first
instance
by
the
voluntary
agreement
of
the
various
railroads
participating
therein.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
it
might
be,
mr.
justice
douglas
except
that
i'd
like
to
say
this
as
long
as
you
ask
me
about
it
that
in
case
this
is
of
any
enlightenment
to
the
court.
proportional
rates
are
what
i
would
call
a
qualified
rate
whether
they'd
be
a
single
line
rate,
made
without
anybody
else's
agreement
as
the
canadian
rates
were
in
this
instance
or
whether
they
are
joint
rates
made
up
of
the
agreement
of
two
or
more
lines.
but
the
significance
to
me
of
an
--
of
a
proportional
rate
is
the
fact
that
it's
something
special,
it's
a
limited
rate,
it
doesn't
have
general
application.
in
this
instance,
as
i
think
is
clear
from
the
record
in
the
various
briefs,
if
a
shipment
of
this
particular
commodity
were
made
from
one
of
the
origin
mines
to
either
east
alburgh
or
newport,
vermont,
the
--
the
canadian
factor
which
is
involved
in
these
proceedings
would
have
had
no
application
because
there's
a
specific
tariff
provision
that
restricts
its
application
in
the
case
like
that
and
--
or
good,
bad
or
in
different
reasons
throughout
the
--
for
more
than
50
to
75
years
at
least.
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying,
it
has
been
--
those
--
that
type
of
rate
has
been
referred
to
in
the
commerce
world
as
a
proportional
rate.
it's
--
they
maybe
made
for
a
number
of
reasons,
largely,
i
would
say
competitive
reasons
perhaps
where
one
railroad
or
group
of
railroads
may
think
it
necessary
to
take
something
less
than
they
would
normally
do
for
purposes
of
transportation
competition
or
purposes
of
industrial
competition,
for
purposes
if
you
choose
a
foreign
competition,
the
production
in
foreign
lands
that
the
railroad
industry
as
such
may
feel
some
necessity
of
attempting
to
assist
the
industry,
the
manufacture
on
the
one
hand
and
itself
on
the
other
as
transportation
agency.
now,
the
other
type
of
rate
of
course
is
a
local
rate
which
maybe
--
which
usually
would
be
a
rate
published
by
one
railroad
for
so
called
local
application
and
that
it
would
be
general.
that
rate
would
have
--
if
that
--
if
these
canadian
rates
had
been
published
as
so
called
local
rates
there
would
have
been
no
restriction
on
their
use
whether
the
traffic,
being
shipped
under
them,
were
to
come
to
rest
finally
at
east
alburgh
or
newport
or
whether
it
was
to
continue
which
journey
down
to
charlotte,
north
carolina.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
the
disagreement
in
the
--
involved
in
this
litigation
stems
from
the
failure
of
the
commission
and
our
friends
who
argue
for
them
to
distinguish
what
this
court
has
previously
said
and
done
with
respect
to
the
commission's
jurisdiction
over
international
traffic
in
the
sense
that
you
have
heretofore
been
dealing
with
reparation
cases,
cases
where
rates
for
the
future
were
not
involved
and
reparation
cases
in
which
joint
rates
were
involved.
and
it
seems
to
me,
from
the
beginning
and
--
and
still
does,
that
the
law
in
that
respect
is
crystal
clear.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it
originated
with
the
commission
itself
who
first
enunciated
the
general
doctrine
in
a
case
that's
referred
to,
i'm
sure
through
all
our
briefs,
the
so
called
black
horse
tobacco
case
reported
in
17
i.c.c.
588,
as
long
ago
as
1910.
and
the
gist
of
the
generally
recognized
rule
is
that
american
and
i
--
i
emphasize
the
word
american,
american
railroads
have
a
clear
alternative
with
respect
to
their
participation
in
international
traffic.
they
may
publish
rates
to
and
from
the
border,
in
which
event
they
are
liable
only
for
the
lawfulness
of
those
rates.
and
when
i
say
lawfulness,
i
mean
lawfulness
whether
measured
under
section
1,
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
or
section
3
preference
or
prejudice.
or
they
can
enter
into
joint
rates
voluntarily
in
which
event
they
become
jointly
and
severally
liable
for
the
lawfulness
of
those
rates.
and
again,
it
doesn't
make
too
much
difference,
i
don't
suppose
whether
you
talk
section
1
or
3
or
both.
so
that
i
hearsay
if
i
may
repeat
that
the
simple
question
here
is
the
--
is
whether
the
commission
had
jurisdiction.
it
either
did
or
did
not
and
i
say
this
court,
no
more
than
the
three-judge
court,
doesn't
have
to
journey
too
far
into
the
woods
and
fail
to
see
the
trees
if
i
may
use
a
common
expression.
in
this
instance,
you've
been
told
a
little
bit
about
already
and
we
have
discussed
at
length
in
our
brief
three
cases
that
seems
to
me
are
all
that
need
to
be
examined
in
order
for
this
court
to
make
its
determination
of
the
issue
before
it.
the
first
is
the
so
called
news
syndicate
case
reported
at
275
u.s.
179.
the
second
is
the
lewis-simas
case
reported
at
283
u.s.
654
and
the
third
is
the
great
northern
versus
sullivan
case
to
which,
mr.
ginnane
has
already
referred.
now,
each
of
those
cases
was
a
reparation
case.
i
--
i
was
inclined
to
say
that
reparation
here
is
an
incidental
aspect
of
it.
that's
the
tail
on
the
horse.
i'm
sure
my
good
friend,
mr.
ussery
wouldn't
agree
with
me
on
that
point
but
i
do
say
that
before
you
start
to
worry
about
whether
the
rates
have
been
unreasonable
or
otherwise
unlawful
in
the
past,
the
big
thing
to
be
determined
here
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
to
take
these
complaints
and
deal
with
them
at
the
outset.
and
you
can
forget
all
about
the
reparation
insofar
as
that
particular
aspect
is
concerned
because
if
they
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
that's
the
end
of
the
line.
if
they
did,
i
--
i
guess
we're
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
are
wasting
our
time
and
that
of
the
court's
in
arguing
to
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
--
the
contrary.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
jurisdiction
over
the
rates
applicable
on
this
traffic
and
if
i
may
say
that,
there
has
been
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
is
--
did
you
say
is
that
because?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
wouldn't
say
it
was
because
of
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
would
say
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
traffic
were
moving
into
canada,
rather
than
others.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
either
way
--
that's
right,
because
international
traffic
is
involved.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
--
i
don't
have
any
doubt
at
all
about
it
and
we've
said
so
in
our
brief
specifically
and
i
say
this
to
you,
mr.
justice
black.
the
only
thing
wrong,
i
keep
telling
myself
and
i
certainly
in
hope
i'm
right
at
this
late
stage
of
this
litigation,
the
only
thing
wrong
with
this
--
with
these
complaints
was
the
fact
that
they
fail
to
assail
the
american
factor
of
the
rate.
if
they
had
done
that
and
the
commission
had
made
substantially
the
same
determination
that
it
did
--
well,
they'd
be
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
my
answer
to
you,
sir
it
is
no
different
except
in
this
respect.
again,
i
say
the
rate
to
be
assailed
as
causing
the
preference
or
prejudice
under
section
3
must
be
the
rate
from
the
border,
the
american
factor
and
not
the
through
rate
regardless
of
--
i
won't
say
regardless.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
--
i
see
no
reason
why
not,
mr.
justice
harlan.
the
--
i
--
i
wouldn't
be
frank
with
you
if
i
didn't
concede
that
the
sullivan
case
has
given
us
lots
of
reason
to
ponder
and
think.
but
we
think
we
have
the
answer
to
the
sullivan
case
and
unlike
mr.
ginnane
here,
his
client
does
too.
we
say
the
answer
to
the
sullivan
case
is
clear,
the
--
the
court,
this
court
said
that
the
issue
there
was
whether
the
uncontroverted
facts,
it
--
it
appears
on
the
very
first
page
of
the
decision,
page
459,
whether
the
uncontroverted
facts
and
those
found
by
the
commission
are
sufficient
to
warrant
the
conclusion
that
he,
the
plaintiff
there,
sustained
--
sustained
damage
in
consequence
of
the
--
of
a
violation
of
the
act
by
the
defendant.
and
the
conclusion
of
the
court
set
forth
at
the
--
the
end
of
its
opinion
on
page
43
--
463
rather,
is
that
it
follows
that
retention
by
the
defendant
of
an
undue
proportion
of
just
and
reasonable
charges,
did
not
damage
the
plaintiff.
if
i
can
without
getting
too
involved
in
that,
the
court
there
refused
to
look
at
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
had
a
right
to
deal
with
the
overall
thing
jurisdictionally
i
don't
--
i
think.
i
don't
think
jurisdiction
as
such
was
raised
and
simply
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
--
passed
it
on
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
simply
dealt
with
it
as
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
proper
proof
of
damage
independent
of
any
jurisdictional
question.
yes
mr.
justice?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes
sir.
if
these
--
if
these
had
been
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
don't
think
it
is
precisely
the
same
discrimination
because
in
the
one
case
you'd
have
a
joint
rate,
the
assailed
rate
from
quebec
origin
to
charlotte,
assailed
that
is
creating
either
undue
and
unreasonable
rates
and
charges
or
unduly
preferential
and
prejudicial
rates
and
charges
versus
other
joint
rates
maintained
to
official
territory,
ambler,
pennsylvania
specifically.
but
if
there
had
been
rates
published
and
we
say
they
were
from
the
boundary
--
from
the
border
to
ambler
--
to
charlotte,
then
we
say
the
question
of
their
lawfulness
must
be
measured
by
them
alone.
you
don't
go
beyond
the
border
to
look
at
them
for
any
reason
and
there's
nothing
i
can
find
in
this
or
any
of
the
court
preceding
that
says
anything
different
in
that.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
mr.
justice
black,
the
answer
to
--
my
answer
to
that
if
i
were
counsel
to
the
other
side
would
be
to
tell
them
to
file
a
complaint
with
the
interstate
congress
commission
and
assail
the
legality
of
the
american
factor.
and
if
they
could
show
that
that
rate
and
charge
produced
unlawfulness,
they'd
be
entitled
to
relief.
now,
on
that
very
point
let
me
make
this
observation
that
one
of
the
things
wrong
with
all
of
these
is
that
our
canadian
friends,
good
neighbors
as
they
are,
the
canadian
railroads
in
particular
here,
would
be
free
where
canadian
factors
are
involved
to
do
as
they
please
with
respect
to
the
level
of
them
and
neither
the
commission
nor
the
courts
of
the
united
states
could
do
anything
about
that.
they
could
raise
or
lower
them
as
they
saw
fit.
and
i
don't
deny
the
--
the
validity
of
an
argument
that
they
might
in
so
doing
make
it
economically
impossible
to
transport
the
merchandise,
but
that's
quite
a
different
thing,
that's
not
the
point.
the
point
here
is
whether
or
not
we
in
fact
publish
rates
to
or
from
the
border.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
to
that
question
is
one
that
the
commission
itself
gave
a
long
time
ago.
in
--
carey
manufacturing
co.
v.
g.t.w.
ry.
co,
reported
at
36
i.c.c.
203
which
coincidentally
happened
to
be
a
complaint
involving
asbestos.
the
commission
said
that
their
jurisdiction
attaches
at
ports
of
entry
and
without
going
into
any
considerable
detail
let
me
point
out
that
we
have
listed
in
appendices
(c)
--
in
appendix
(c)
of
our
brief
a
large
number
of
cases
where
the
commission
itself
has
in
effect
followed
that
statement
of
principle
that
they
would
not
deal
with
the
measure
of
the
rate
that
applied
from
a
so-called
border
point
within
the
united
states
to
a
destination
in
canada
or
vise
versa.
they
have
gone
further
than
that
and
where
joint
rates
were
involved,
they
have
by
and
large
disclaimed
any
right
to
deal
with
the
fact
of
beyond
--
with
--
not
with
the
measure
of
the
rates,
not
the
factor,
the
measure
of
the
--
single
entity
rates
beyond
the
port
of
entry
or
the
interchange
point.
but
for
the
first
time
that
i
can
discover
in
our
particular
case,
they
say
that
that
sort
of
a
situation
is
not
sufficient
to
--
to
deprive
them
of
jurisdiction
that
on
the
contrary,
it
gives
them
jurisdiction
because
the
canadian
factor,
says
the
commission,
obligates
the
canadian
carriers
to
perform
substantial
transportation
service
within
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
by
results,
you
mean
the
--
the
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
the
general
nature
of
the
type
of
thing
that
the
commission
has
given
us
in
its
report
and
order.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
would
say
exactly
the
same
thing
with
them.
i'll
go
this
far
mr.
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
--
justice
frankfurter
and
i
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
may
only
prove
that
i'm
not
as
smart
as
i
should
be.
i
would
be--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
[attempt
to
laughter]
i'm
not
smart
enough
to
do
that
either,
sir.
i
have
said
to
our
own
colleagues
in
discussing
this
case
that
if
the
--
if
these
complaints
had
assailed
the
american
factor
from
east
alburgh
or
newport
to
charlotte,
made
the
same
allegations
and
offered
evidence
with
respect
to
those
on
a
merit
basis
the
commission
would
probably
have
reached
a
decision
entirely
favorable
to
them.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
substantially
this
order
i
think.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
if
that
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
say
that
in
my
honest
judgment
as
somebody
with
a
lot
of
traffic
as
well
as
legal
experience,
that's
my
considered
judgment,
yes
sir.
and
a
proper
complaint
on
a
proper
record,
i
think
the
outcome
would
have
been
relevantly
just
as
successful
to
the
other
side
as
this.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
but
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
no,
sir.
no,
sir
because
there
is
no
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
sir?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i'm
not
giving
a
thing
away
i
don't
think
[laughter]
because
we
say
you
see
that
if
we're
correct
on
the
jurisdictional
contention
we
make,
then
the
complaints
were
defective
on
their
face
and
fall.
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
this
record
for
example
that
deals
with
the
measure,
the
lawfulness
of
the
american
factor
as
such.
there's
no
conclusion
or
finding
by
the
commission
that
the
american
factor
as
such
and
there's
no
order
directed
to
the
american
factor
as
such.
and
we
say
incidentally
that
all
the
commission
actually
did
was
to
throw
in
the
statutory
language
insofar
as
transportation
takes
place
within
the
united
states
in
an
attempt
by
giving
that
kind
of
lip
service
to
the
statute
to
get
the
overall
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
the
entire
rate
situation.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
guess
the
answer
to
the
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
if
it
in
--
if
it
in
here
is
entirely
in
the
rest
of
the
rate,
of
course,
his
forum
and
his
(voice
overlap)
complaint
and
everything
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
sorry?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
don't
like
to
disagree
with
you,
sir
but
the
sullivan
case
doesn't
make
too
much
sense
to
me
at
all.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
except
in
--
and
except
if
i
am
correct
in
my
analysis
of
what
the
only
issue
there
was
and
what
the
court
--
the
only
finding
that
the
court
made
and
i
get
substantial
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
district
court
in
effect,
seems
to
me
to
have
said
substantially
the
same
thing.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
they'd
be
different
in
this
respect
and
this
respect
only
--
only.
theoretically
--
well,
i
guess
it's
been,
say
at
the
record.
they
would
have
been
different
in
the
sense
that
the
rate
from
newport
or
east
alburgh
to
charlotte
would
be
the
assailed
rate,
the
rate
that
allegedly
caused
the
unlawfulness
in
those
rates
and
the
undue
preference
or
prejudice
by
comparison
with
the
other
rates.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
assuming
the
same
general
type
of
record,
the
same
general
type
of
evidence
and
so
on,
i
have
no
doubt
in
the
world
with
this
further
qualification
that
the
--
the
commission
there,
because
there'd
be
no
limitation
on
their
powers
of
proscription
in
fixing
rates,
would
have
been
able
to
do
--
would
have
been
able
to
say
that
the
rate
for
the
future,
such
and
such
a
rate
for
the
future
would
be
a
maximum
reasonable
rate
for
the
railroads
to
apply
from
east
alburgh
or
newport
to
charlotte,
number
one.
number
two,
they
could
say,
giving
us
an
alternative
that
they
are
preferential
or
prejudicial
and
incidentally
as
this
court
undoubtedly
knows,
they
could
still
be
reasonable
but
nevertheless
preferential
or
prejudicial
in
violation
of
section
3.
but
they
could
then
give
us
an
alternative
order
which
left
to
us
the
choice
of
raising
the
one
or
lowering
the
other.
or
third,
because
of
good
and
sufficient
reasons,
they
could
exercise
the
authority
granted
them
under
section
157
if
i
recall
correctly
affixing
the
exact
measure
of
the
rates
to
thereafter
be
maintained
from
both
competitive
origins
in
order
to
make
the
rates
for
the
future,
non-preferential
and
non-prejudicial.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
that
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
my
answer
to
that
of
course
is
going
to
be
a
rather
guarded
one.
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
give
you
my
personal
opinion
as
to
what
the
commission's
--
commission's
decision
would
have
been
on
a
complaint
that
put
an
issue
in
a
--
in
a
proper
proceeding,
the
issues
which
i
think
should
have
been
raised,
but
i
don't
think
it
follows
that
--
that
an
--
in
anyway
we
waive
any
right
that
we
may
have
had
or
that
we
are
now
going
to
be
in
effect
arguing
out
the
court
by
an
expression
of
a
personal
opinion
by
myself
as
a
--
an
expert
or
an
ignoramus
as
to
what
the
administrative
agency
like
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
or
would
not
do
on
a
given
set
of
facts.
i
don't
think
that
follows
the
point.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
correct.
we
say
that
there's
no
jurisdiction
here
in
this
thing
--
all
thing
falls
and
that's
in
effect
what
that
three-judge
court
has
found.
and
i
say
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
oh
absolutely
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
right
and
i
--
i
don't
know
what
i
did
because
i
--
i
abstracted.
one
of
the
answers
to
--
to
some
of
these
questions
i've
been
given
and
the
reason
i
said
mr.
ginnane's
own
client
doesn't
agree
with
him
appears
in
a
decision
by
the
commission
itself,
in
yellow
jacket
boat
company
inc.
versus
h.s.n.t.
and
s.f.
ry.
co.
reported
at
305
i.c.c.
117,
where
the
defendants
in
that
case
relied
on
sullivan
and
said,
“you
can
assail
as
an
american
factor
alone,
you
got
to
assail
the
whole
thing”
and
interstate
commerce
commission
doesn't
seem
to
agree
with
mr.
ginnane
there.
they
seem
to
agree
with
me.
and
i
just
pointed
that
out
in
the
brief
too
because
they
say
here
that
this
doctrine
that
you
have
to
assail
the
total
rate
applies
only
to
domestic
traffic.
it
doesn't
apply
to
international
traffic.
and
least,
i
--
i
won't
take
the
court's
time
or
perhaps
my
own
to
read
at
all
but
the
discussion
is
rather
protracted,
appearing
in
pages
116
and
17
of
the
report.
and
they
say
there
what
i
have
said
in
effect
that
a
local
rate
is
complete
in
and
of
itself
and
it's
not
dependent
for
its
application
upon
a
movement
to
or
from
beyond
the
border
and
in
that
respect
differs
from
a
proportional
rate
which
is
in
the
nature
of
a
division
of
joint
rate
where
shipments
originating
at
canadian
points
beyond
the
border
move
on
local
rates
from
the
border
to
destinations
in
this
country,
the
complaint
maybe
directed
to
the
local
rate
or
rates
from
the
international
boundary.
no
necessity
according
to
the
commission
in
spite
of
sullivan
to
assail
the
through
rate.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
think
that
the
simple
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
whittaker
is
yes.
i
would
like
to
elaborate
just
a
little
bit
on
it
if
i
may
and
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
if
they
had
amended
it,
it
would
be
the
equivalent
of
a
new
complaint
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
it's
common
place
to
the
amend
complaints.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
but
if
they
have
done
that,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
sir?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
if
they
had
done
that,
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
jurisdiction
or
argument
there
because
the
whole
record
would
thereupon
be
restricted
to
evidence
related
--
relating
to
the
american
factor,
the
second
factor
of
this
combination
rate
situation.
and
important
to
one
of
my
friends
here,
the
amendment
of
the
complaint
would
probably
have
wiped
out
considerable
of
limit
--
limit
--
considerable
reparation
by
virtue
of
the
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
which
would
have
excluded
anything
that
moved
prior
to
the
date
of
the
amendment.
that's
an
important
consideration
from
their
standpoint.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
the
issue
was
actually
tried
in
this
--
in
this
proceeding,
in
this
litigation,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
from
beginning
to
end
related
to
the
entire
transportation
never
to
the
transportation
within
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
correct
yes
sir
except
in
--
maybe
i
answered
you
a
little
too
fast
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
don't
--
i
guess
my
answer
wouldn't
be
necessarily
so
far
as
determining
the
lawfulness
of
the
american
factor
for
the
future.
the
commission
--
the
complainants
and
the
commission
could
only
properly
have
looked
at
the
measure
of
rates
applicable
within
the
united
states
but
they
could
have
adverted
to
the
fact
as
they
undoubtedly
would
that
the
american
factor
rates
were
unlawful
because
we
were
maintaining
joint
rates
to
ambler,
pennsylvania.
and
as
to
that,
the
commission
to
some
extent
in
agreement
with
mr.
ginnane,
the
commission
would
have
the
--
have
had
to
right
to
do
two
things.
they
would
have
had
the
right
to
give
us
a
cease
and
desist
order.
that's
clear,
this
court
has
said
so.
they
would
also
have
had
the
right
to
award
reparation
for
--
so
far
as
the
american
factor
was
concerned
and
they'd
have
had
the
right
to
proscribe
a
reasonable
rate
for
the
future
from
east
alburgh
or
newport.
they
could
go
no
further
not
--
if
i
can
--
if
i
can
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
i
can
simply
say
this
to
you
in
respect
to
that.
that
maybe
an
economic
problem
but
it
isn't
one
that
is
--
is
something
for
this
court
to
deal
with
in
deciding
the
legal
question
here,
number
one.
number
two
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well
i
would
say
this.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
i
would
simply
say
this
to
you.
so
far
as
the
measure,
the
level
of
the
canadian
factor
is
concerned
in
a
situation
tried,
as
i
would
say
this
could've
been
tried,
the
level
of
rates
within
canada
afford
no
proper
yardstick
for
determining
the
lawfulness
of
the
american
factors.
your
entire
transportation
situation
is
different.
your
--
the
standards
of
the
--
standards,
the
transportation
factors
of
lawfulness
within
canada
are
probably
different
than
those
that
operate
within
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
don't
honestly
remember,
mr.
justice
black.
the
record
certainly
shows
that
with
respect
of
the
carolina
traffic,
we
charge
rate
x
for
the
canadian
railroads,
(voice
overlap)
we
charge
rate
x
for
whatever
that
maybe
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
there
certainly
is
no
cost
evidence
as
such
in
the
entire
record
that's
for
sure.
i
can't
think
of
hand
of
any
evidence
that
would
cause
me
to
give
you
an
affirmative
answer
and
rather
than
to
answer
you
negatively
and
perhaps
be
wrong,
i
say
frankly
i
don't
remember.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
don't
remember
that
either
and
i
take
it,
mr.
ussery,
my
distinguished
opponent
in
behalf
of
the
complainants
here
is
nodding
his
head
no.
well,
i'm
pretty
sure
the
--
and
feel
safer
now
in
saying
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
getting
back
to
the
question
of
interest
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
no,
i
don't
think
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
think,
sir,
i
would
try
to
answer
you
this
way
if
i
may.
it
might
simplify
the
thinking
of
the
court
and
perhaps
mine
in
answering
your
question
if
we
forget
all
about
ambler
and
official
territory
for
a
moment
because
the
situation
by
and
large
wouldn't
be
any
--
any
different
except
--
the
basic
question
wouldn't
be
from
my
standpoint.
if
all
that
was
involved
here
was
a
complaint,
assail
the
lawfulness
of
a
given
rate
from
a
canadian
origin
to
a
--
to
a
charlotte
destination
where
the
rate
charged
on
it
was
not
a
single
entity
rate
but
one
made
over
newport
or
east
alburgh,
vermont,
my
position
still
would
be
that
the
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
the
entire
transportation
rate
in
charge
and
to
tell
us
what
to
do
or
what
not
to
do
about
it
except
perhaps
that
--
well,
let
me
change
--
i'll
put
it
this
way
--
except
to
say
one
of
two
things
either
take
the
position
as
we
did
here.
they
had
jurisdiction
in
which
event,
they
would
undertake
the
fine
that
it
was
unreasonable
for
the
past,
although
they
could
not
as
the
prior
discussion
brought
out
proscribe
or
to
require
the
establishment
of
a
single
factor
through
rate.
they
could
give
you
instead
a
cease
and
desist
order
that
would
make
you
correct
it
insofar
as
the
transportation
takes
place
within
the
united
states.
and
i
think
perhaps
it's
a
lot
easier
if
we
think
of
the
single
rate
regardless
of
the
section
3
aspect
of
it
because
it's
an
issue
that
is
jurisdictional
under
the
statute.
now,
the
statute
is
clear.
i
don't
argue
at
all
that
the
commission
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
insofar
as
transportation
takes
place
within
the
united
states.
i
do
argue
as
to
what
that
means
and
i
say
the
answer
to
it
is
to
be
found
in
the
commission's
decisions.
for
40
years,
they
haven't
held
as
to
the
exact
boundary
line
of
the
border.
they
have
departed
from
it
to
the
extent
of
20
miles
in
the
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
there's
--
there's
certainly
dollars
involved.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
but
i'm
not
so
sure
that
we're
here
only
because
of
the
dollars
involved
in
this
litigation.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
we're
here
because
of
the
principle
involved.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
and
the
fact
--
that
we've
never
been
told
that
the
commission
--
by
commission
or
the
courts.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
it
had
jurisdiction
where
anything
other
than
joint
rate
was
involved.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
--
if
i
may,
let
me
answer
your
question
in
this
--
in
this
fashion.
i'd
be
willing
to
concede
arguendo
that
that
was
the
case,
but
to
insist
still
that
that's
no
part
of
the
issue
which
the
court
is
here
required
to
determine,
seems
to
me
it's
--
it's
very
simple.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
yes,
sir.
absolutely
and
i
said
that
as
clearly
as
i
knew
how
in
the
three
court
--
in
the
three-judge
court
action.
i
said
that
in
the
--
in
our
briefs
as
well.
and
i
say
that
the
thing
that
has
to
be
determined
is
whether
or
not
behind
the
language
of
the
statute
the
contentions
of
the
commission
which
in
effect
would
say,
“that
unless
you
publish
your
rate
to
the
exact
boundary
line,
you
haven't
complied
with
your
statutory
duty.”
is
that
that
the
law
or
is
the
law
that
you
can
publish
a
rate
to
a
so-called
border
point,
point
which
the
commission
itself
has
characterized
as
points
which
for
all
practical
purposes
are
international
border
points.
in
this
instance,
the
district
court
said,
“border
points
within
the
united
states.”
now,
in
another
proceeding,
right
in
that
same
area,
here
we're
being
hung
for
three
or
five
miles
of
entry
into
the
united
states
by
canadian
carriers
for
the
sole
purpose
of
interchanging
their
traffic
and
they
--
they
say
that
gives
them
jurisdiction.
in
another
case
where
the
--
the
port
of
entry
and
the
interchange
point
was
highgate
springs
and
the
distance
was
close
to
four
miles
right
in
between
these
two.
commission
said
that's
--
that's
transportation
within
canada
and
ignored
that
completely.
well,
i'm
old
fashioned
enough
i
guess
to
think
that
you
just
don't
say
one
thing
means
x
today
and
y
tomorrow
especially
when
you're
dealing
with
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
that's
(inaudible)
and
that's
cited
in
the
appendix
(d)
of
our
brief
mr.
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
green.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
it's
the
last
page
of
the
document,
204
i.c.c.
284.
now
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
no,
sir.
no.
and
may
i
say
this
in
that
connection.
you'll
notice
that
the
commission's
report
here
has
said
that
the
publication
of
these
canadian
rates
to
points
just
three
or
five
miles
inside
the
border
obligated
the
canadian
carriers
to
perform
substantial
transportation
service
within
the
united
states.
it
fails
to
say
what
that
substantial
transportation
service
was.
it
doesn't
--
it
hasn't
benefited
from
the
admonishment
that
it
has
gotten
a
number
of
times
by
this
court,
and
particularly
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
make
reports
clear
so
that
we
know
what
they
say,
so
the
court
knows
what
they
say
and
make
it
easier
to
rule
upon
the
legality
of
the
report
and
so
on.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
in
all
candor
i
know
of
none
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
do
know
that
30
years
ago
and
we've
cited
in
our
briefs
i
think,
generally
speaking,
the
--
the
apparent
informal
agreement
of
the
respective
agencies
was
to
let
the
canadian
agency
deal
with
southbound
rates
coming
into
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
originating
rate
making
line
and
commission
would
deal
with
it
and
similarly,
northbound.
that
was
an
instance
in
which
it
seems
to
me
the
commission
without
any
notice
at
least
has
departed
from
its
practice.
now,
let
me
say
this
if
i
may
because
i'm
sure
my
time
is
fast
running.
i
say
to
you
that
that
the
--
the
fact
of
the
commission
had
given
the
railroads
this
rule
or
principle
that
they
could
publish
rates
to
points
like
highgate
springs
or
newport
and
the
like
and
that
that
would
be
recognized
for
all
practical
purposes
as
a
border
point
is
a
rule
that's
been
in
effect
for
40
years.
we
say
that
when
an
agency
like
the
commission
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
statute
construes
it
in
that
fashion
for
40
years.
we
have
a
right
to
rely
on
it.
we
say
we
did
rely
on
it
and
therefore,
that
we
are
being
done
wrong
by
when
the
commission
now
departs
from
it
without
any
notification.
now,
the
administrative
procedure
act,
we
say,
provides
a
means
whereby
if
the
commission
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
decides
that
they
should
no
longer
do
anything
other
than
stick
to
the
boundary
line
proper,
they
could've
undertaken
a
formal
proceeding
that
would've
acquainted
everybody
in
the
country
with
the
possibility
of
a
change.
put
them
all
on
notice
and
if
they
thereafter
required
something
different
or
adhered
to
some
different
principle,
we
would
have
had
no
cause
for
complaint.
but
they
didn't
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
the
--
the
40-year
practice?
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
appendix
(c)
for
one,
it's
referred
to
through
out
the
body
of
it
but
-
-
appendix
(c)
in
particular
where
we
deal
briefly
with
a
lot
of
the
cases
that
were
dealt
with.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
i
don't
think
so,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
they've
met
it,
more
important
i
say
they
haven't
met
yet.
what
i
say
is
the
crux
of
the
whole
thing
is
the
publication
of
--
or
the
maintenance
of
a
rate
to
a
point
like
east
alburgh,
foes
that
satisfy
the
insofar
as
--
the
transportation
takes
place
within
the
united
states
clause
of
the
statute?
does
transportation
across
the
border
on
a
canadian
rate
to
a
point
three
or
five
miles
inside
of
the
border
for
the
incidental
purpose
of
letting
go
of
the
traffic
for
american
transportation,
is
that
the
kind
of
transportation
that
the
statute
was
intended
to
apply
to?
and
i
don't
think
it
is,
we
don
think
it
is
and
that's
the
reason
we're
here.
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
well,
that's
true
but
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
that
far.
imagine
we
were
the
part
of
six
or
eight
years
in
trying
to
get
to
the
point
where
we
got
a
three-judge
court
to
agree
with
us.
i'd
like
--
mr.
j.
edgar
mcdonald
it
shouldn't.
now,
there'd
be
no
more
possibility
for
the
kind
of
contentions
that
have
been
made
here
and
i'm
sure
the
--
one
of
the
moving
reasons
for
instigating
it.
that
would
be
gone.
the
possibility
of
getting
reparation
on
traffic
that
moved
1950,
1951
or
1952
would've
been
wiped
out
by
the
operation
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
i
--
the
part
that's
almost
entirely
if
not
entirely
from
my
prepared
arguments,
so
i'm
a
little
bit
lost
but
i
think
i'd
be
infringing
on
the
court
and
probably
overstepping
my
time.
i
will
thank
the
court
and
sit
down.
