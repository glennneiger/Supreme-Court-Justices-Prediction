justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
dealing
with
the
rates
here
but
these
relations
of
rates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
--
isn't
--
mr.
solomon,
isn't
the
disharmony
between
the
two
rates,
namely,
the
joint
rate
into
official
territory
is
a
combination
rate
into
southern
territory?
isn't
that
disparity
or
disharmony
as
you
conceive
it,
due
to
the
fact
that
they
have
entered
into
a
joint
rate
which
is
lawfully
been
entered
into?
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i'll
withdraw
the
lawfully,
at
least
it's
been
entered
into
under
circumstances
that
the
commission
can't
control
as
such?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
nor
can
the
commission
bring
about
--
i'm
not
--
my
--
this
is
a
question
in
the
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
--
it
isn't
--
it's
not
an
argument
of
this
question,
nor
can
it
compel
a
joint
rate
to
the
southern
territory
because
that
involves
control
over
the
canadian
railroad
which
it
hasn't
got,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
here,
was
reaching
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
go
slow
and
see
what
difficulty
is
here
whether
--
namely,
whether
the
commission
isn't
trying
to
split
the
devil
around
the
stump.
if
this
were
all
in
--
within
the
territory
of
the
united
states,
there'd
be
no
problem,
would
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
would
control
the
situation
through
its
power
to
compel
to
do
or
undo
joint
rates,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
no
such
power
because
canada
intervened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
i'm
not
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
antitrust
--
it
cannot
bring
about
that
result
by
virtue
of
control
over
joint
rates.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
--
if
it
--
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
consequences
--
it
can,
i
understand
that
but
not
the
fact.
it
can't
compel
either
the
abolition
or
the
entering
into
of
joint
rate
in
this
situation,
can
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
(voice
overlap)
it
can,
the
abolition
in
result
but
can
it
--
can
it
tell
the
american
railroads
not
to
have
joint
rates
with
the
canadians?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
good
is
it
to
say
if
it
weren't
the
law
then
if
--
if
it
--
if
it
wasn't
the
law,
it
would
be
the
law
but
it
isn't
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
want
us
to
reverse
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
was
all
in
continental-united
states
(inaudible),
it
wouldn't
have
to
give
them
an
option.
it
could
direct
the
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it
could
direct
entering
into
a
joint
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
--
i'm
not
--
do
you
think
i'm
attacking
your
conclusion.
i'm
not
doing
that
at
all.
i'm
trying
to
analyze
it
which
is
a
different
thing.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
this
weren't
all
this
--
if
this
activity
were
performed
in
the
united
states,
it
could
deal
with
it
very
easily,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
many
ways,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
circumscribed
it's
limited
in
dealing
with
it
by
virtue
of
the
participation
of
a
non-controllable
canadian
carrier,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
well
i'm
--
but
it
can't
deal
with
it
by
ordering
joint
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
seem
--
you
seem
to
shy
away
as
though
you
think
i'm
--
there's
some
trap
in
my
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
therefore,
the
question
arises
whether
--
since
it
can,
since
this
situation
has
arisen
by
virtue
of
the
power
of
the
carriers
to
enter
into
joint
rates
beyond
the
control
as
such,
confronts
some
comfort
as
to
my
qualification
as
such,
as
such
the
i.c.c.
cannot
deal
with
the
joint
rate
coming
from
canada,
can
it?
it
can't
say
--
well
if
you
should
stop
having
a
joint
rate
or
it
can't
--
you
reduce
the
joint
rate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
deal
with,
i
said
order
a
which
is
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
that
isn't
the
question,
you're
not
arguing
the
abstract
question
here.
i
don't
think
the
question
put
by
--
where
was
it,
the
district
court?
is
--
is
that
the
question?
i
don't
think
that's
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
can
enter
into
a
--
into
a
--
where
is
it,
the
open
--
the
government
brief.
the
question
i
think
is
abstractly
stated
there,
where
is
it,
just
a
second.
well,
i
saw
something.
the
question
is
in
the
abstract
thing
does
the
commissioner
of
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
factor
or
a
combination
of
international
rate.
you
agree
with
that,
that
that's
the
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
abstract
way
of
putting
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
you'd
be
mobilized
--
if
you'll
be
mobilized
i
--
i
think
i
could
get
some
help
out
of
you
which
is
what
i'm
looking
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
--
there's
no
hostility
that
maybe
--
that's
not
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
question,
is
it,
whether
has
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
factor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we'll
hear
mr.
ginnane.
the
question
is
assuming
they
can't
do
anything
about
the
arrangement
entered
into
with
the
canadian
character
because
that's
a
canadian
character,
can
it
deal
with
the
consequences
of
such
an
arrangement.
isn't
that
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
rate
--
the
carriers
say
that
situation
derived
from
our
ability
or
our
power
beyond
your
control
of
condemnation
as
such
into
entering
into
an
arrangement
with
the
canadian
carrier
and
that
canadian
character
is
under
no
obligation
so
far
as
this
--
the
united
states
authority
is
concerned,
into
entering
into
a
similar
arrangement
going
south.
isn't
that
true
as
a
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
are
gun
shy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
advantage
you
take
of
being
--
of
participating
in
an
--
in
an
international
transaction
doesn't
preclude
the
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
the
national
part
of
that
transaction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i,
instead
of
interrupting
you
mr.
ginnane,
ask
you
whether
a
mere
reading
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
an
answer
to
this
question?
suppose
i
very
conscientiously
and
zealously
read
and
reread
the
interstate
commerce
act
as
such
would
i
get
an
answer
to
this
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
would
you
get
a
hold
of
the
canadian
carrier?
would
--
would
you
make
an
order
and
then
the
--
the
court
sustains
the
order
as
--
as
a
practical
thing
the
order
--
i
suppose
the
canadian
carrier
is
located
in
canada.
practically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
obey.
i
--
i
assume
practically,
the
obedience
is
given
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
we
can
ask
them
and
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
they
have
an
agent
in
the
united
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
have
an
injunction
against
scrapping
them,
on
whom
would
the
injunction
be
served,
to
its
agent?
it
is
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
where
is
he?
who
is
he?
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
suggesting
trouble.
i
just
want
to
know
how
this
action
would
be.
i
mean
the
prejudice,
the
--
the
individuals
who
would
be
actively
in
charge
of
their
cars
and
their
equipment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
because
part
of
it
intrudes
into
the
united
states,
you
can
pass
a
judgment
--
you
must
pass
judgment
on
the
entirety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
that
is
not,
mr.
ginnane
because
in
any
sense
it
has
validity,
the
commission
assumed
jurisdiction
over
the
canadian
part
of
the
traffic
but
in
order
to
exercise
jurisdiction
of
that
which
is
it's
duty
to
exercise,
namely
the
american
part,
it
must
take
into
account
the
whole
of
which
the
american
is
at
part.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
means
that
you
may
find
that
there
is
either
the
proportional
or
the
combination
of
the
joint
was
unreasonable
but
you
can't
assess
the
--
the
unreasonableness
against
the
canadian.
you
have
to
break
up
the
share
that
belongs
to
the
american,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
was
it
proportioned
to?
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
in
what
you've
just
said,
i
mean
if
you
got
a
--
a
proportional
rate
that
is
really
in
effect
to
joint
rate,
i
don't
--
i'm
confused.
usually
a
proportional
rate
is
proportionate.
that
isn't
the
--
that
isn't
the
normal
usage,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
to
bring
about
a
combination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
what's
--
what's
the
point
of
--
what's
the
technical
of
transportation
reason
for
using
that
lingo?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
it
means
is
that
filed
with
the
commission
is
the
rate
which
--
if
there's
a
combination
used
as
against
using
merely
the
local
purposes
of
what
which
is
used
in
the
combination.
is
that
all
that
is?
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
proportions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
--
is
not
available
for
the
traffic
of
the
second,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
--
so
i
ask
again
why
it
cause
proportions
--
their
proportions
in
relation
to
the
second.
is
that
it?
i'm
--
i'm
confused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
mind
stating
jurisdiction
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
that's
because
--
and
what
--
that's
because
this
originated
in
canada?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
is
that
because
the
rates
originated
on
traffic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
but
with
(voice
overlap)
that
was
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mcdonald.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
revert
to
an
answer
you
gave
to
justice
black
a
little
while
ago
when
he
asked
you
whether
that
means
there's
no
relief
for
inequities
that
the
situation
may
disclose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
quite
eagerly
said,
of
course
there
is
if
they
had
changed
their
complaint
so
as
to
direct
itself
to
allege
the
unreasonableness
or
improper
relations,
the
remedy
would
be
different,
was
it
not?
does
your
answer
imply
that
merely
by
change
of
formulation
of
lawyer's
statement
of
the
case,
the
same
result
could
be
reached
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
actual
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right,
yes.
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
said
that
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
referring
about
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
substantially
this
order,
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
then
this
is
a
very
like
a
lawsuit
under
the
common
law
pleading.
this
is
isn't
--
hasn't
got
much
substance
to
it
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
--
i
don't
mean
say
an
erroneous
enunciation
of
a
principle
may
not
be
mischievous
in
consequences
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
--
you
--
you
said
it
before
in
great
candor
enough.
what
i
get
from
you
is
that
a
redrafting
of
the
complaint
would
bring
about
the
same
result.
that's
what
you've
said,
haven't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
take
care
--
you
may
--
you
may
--
by
--
on
your
theory,
your
--
you
don't
mind
my
saying
so,
skillful
admission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
might
so
far
as
this
cases
is
concerned
be
the
best
rates
might
change
but
i
should
suppose
you
and
every
other
railroads
dealing
with
--
every
other
border
carriers,
if
you
were
has
a
deep
interest
on
the
generality
of
the
--
of
legal
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
real
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
concretely,
if
--
if
the
complaint
had
been
as
you
conceded,
in
the
alternative,
i
take
it
you
would
say
there
could
be
no
reference,
no
--
certainly
no
economic
use
made
of
anything
that
took
place
across
the
border?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
may
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
ask
–
add
one
more
word.
my
difficulty
--
my
real
difficulty
is
that
economically,
from
the
point
of
view
of
--
transposition
economy,
you
cannot
severe
the
american
part
from
the
canadian
part.
what
they
charged,
what
a
matter
of
--
of
railroad
charges,
what
--
what
they
(inaudible)
from
their
point
of
view
as
the
railroad
fixed
by
the
--
by
the
what
do
you
call
from
colors
of
(inaudible)
rate.
how
can
you
disregard
the
canadian
part
of
it,
the
fact
that
they
paid
so
much
or
not
more
or
not
less?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
in
the
context
of
the
lawsuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
you
could
shut
out,
how
you
could
say,
“this
is
merely
a
--
an
american?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
transportation
because
it's
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
surely
that's
the
highgate
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
green
one,
the
green
brief,
mr.
mcdonald?
justice
felix
frankfurter
appendix
(d),
i
gather?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
mr.
ginnane
deal
with
that
case
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
been
wondering
in
my
mind,
but
i'm
meaning
to
ask
you
or
from
ginnane.
is
there
any
kind
of
--
a
kind
of
fraternal
or
informal
relation
is
there
between
the
analog
of
the
i.c.c.
in
canada
and
the
i.c.c.(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
in
your
--
where
in
your
brief
you
deal
with
the
40-year
practice,
namely
administrative
practice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
commission
--
does
the
commission
meet
your
contention
on
that
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
satisfactorily
meet
it,
as
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
here
because
they
brought
you
here,
you
won
your
case.[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
your
theory
was
adopted
and
they
started
a
new
lawsuit,
would
take
another
six
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
wouldn't
--
i'd
like
to
have
his
comment
on
the
administrative
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
well,
no.
that
has
--
but
the
--
the
argument
of
administrative
practice
for
40
years.
it's
just
as
--
anything
in
there
in
the
appendix
(c)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
of
them
or
rather
what
kind
--
was
there
a
period
when
they
shifted
with
a
--
shifted
use?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
his
suggestion
that
if
the
complaints
were
reshaped
you
would
get
the
same
result
but
--
but
he
would
avoid
the
--
but
he
wouldn't
get
the
principle
as
he
is
now
thriving
to
encompass?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
american
segment
of
it,
