mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court?
this
case
involves
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
respect
to
the
shipment
of
raw
asbestos
from
canada
into
various
parts
of
the
united
states,
but
actually,
there
are
two
problems
involved
in
the
case.
the
first
is
the
authority
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
alleviate
what
they
have
found
to
be
an
unjust
--
pardon
me,
unduly
prejudicial
rate
structure
caused
by
a
deviation
in
the
rates
which
are
charged
from
the
same
canadian
points
in
the
one
instance
to
what
is
known
as
official
territory
which
is
the
north
central
--
north
eastern
part
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
other
instance,
to
southern
territory,
that's
the
first
question.
the
second
and
distinct
question
is,
“what
is
the
authority
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
find
that
the
particular
combination
international
rate
between
the
quebec
points
and
southern
territory
was
unreasonable
and
on
the
basis
of
such
a
finding
to
order
reparations
or
to
at
least
establish
a
basis
for
subsequently
ordering
reparations.”
now,
of
these
two
questions,
the
united
states
has
argued
and
i
will
brief
--
united
states
has
briefed
and
i
will
argue
only
one
and
that
is
the
question
of
undue
prejudice.
for
reasons
which
i'll
get
in
to
in
a
minute
or
so,
the
united
states
does
not
believe
that
the
reasonableness
part
of
this
case
albeit
it
was
the
part
of
the
case
in
which
the
district
court
spent
99%
if
its
time,
we
do
not
believe
that
that
was
properly
before
the
district
court
or
before
this
court
but
i
do
want
to
state,
although
i
will
therefore
not
argue
the
merits
of
that
issue
and
leave
that
to
my
colleague.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir.
these
both
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
think
that
the
commission
was
right
on
the
undue
prejudice.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
and
that
we
--
neither
us
nor
the
court
need
to
get
to
the
other
point.
the
commission
thinks
it
was
right
on
both
points.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
i
understand
the
commission's
brief,
they
don't
really
disagree
with
us.
they
are
worried
about
the
point
and
they
have
briefed
it
in
the
event
that
your
honor
should
disagree
with
us
on
the
jurisdiction
point.
but
i
--
as
i
understand
their
brief
and
i
think
i'm
correct
that
they
are
willing
to
have
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
point,
this
court
vacate
the
court's
opinion
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
i
do
want
to
point
out,
however,
that
this
court
will
have
to
deal
with
the
reasonableness
question
in
some
manner,
either
on
jurisdiction
or
on
its
merits
because
the
commission's
order
as
far
as
reparation
is
concerned
rests
upon
its
reasonableness
finding.
and
therefore,
even
if
you'll
agree
with
us
with
respect
to
the
undue
prejudice
part
of
the
case,
the
reasonableness
matter
would
still
be
--
have
to
be
resolved.
now,
in
the
brief
period
before
the
recess,
let
me
sketch
in
some
of
the
facts.
the
problem
here
is
with
respect
as
i
said
to
asbestos
shipments
into
the
united
states.
there's
practically
no
mining
of
asbestos
in
the
united
states.
most
of
the
asbestos
that
is
used
in
our
manufacturing
plants
comes
from
canada,
and
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
asbestos
--
raw
asbestos
that
comes
from
canada
comes
from
a
series
of
mines
in
quebec
province
about
60
miles
north
of
the
vermont
border.
it
goes
to
processing
plants
throughout
the
united
states.
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
i
think
we
can
concentrate
on
two
points
which
can
be
used
for
typifying
the
problem.
the
one
point
i
would
like
to
use
because
the
commission
used
it
as
a
typical
point
in
official
territory
is
ambler,
pennsylvania
which
is
a
place
where
there's
a
processing
plant
in
pennsylvania.
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
use
is
charlotte,
north
carolina
which
happens
to
be
the
location
of
the
plant
of
the
complainant
of
h.
k.
porter.
now,
this
asbestos
is
shipped
from
the
mines
in
quebec
over
either
the
lines
of
quebec
central
railroad
or
the
canadian
national
railroad
to
interchange
points
at
newport
and
east
alburgh,
vermont.
i
think
it
should
be
noted,
although
in
my
opinion
it's
not
necessary
to
my
part
of
the
case
that
this
interchange
takes
place
not
at
the
international
boundary
but
at
places
three
and
five
miles
respectively
inside
the
united
states.
then,
from
this
interchange
part,
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
claimed
that
it's
impractical
to
exchange
at
the
border
and
presumably
you
have
small
towns
with
the
yards
located
at
this
point
a
few
miles
from
the
border
and
either
it's
inconvenient
or
at
least
it
never
has
been
established
to
have
the
interchange
at
the
border
itself.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
selection
of
this
point
as
a
bona
fide
business
is
not
an
issue.
the
relevance
of
the
fact
that
there
is
u.s.
shipment
involved
here
is
very
much
in
issue,
not
in
my
part
of
the
case
but
in
mr.
ginnane's
part
of
the
case.
that
from
these
interchange
points,
the
asbestos
is
shipped
over
a
series
of
u.s.
carriers
to
official
territory
points
and
to
southern
territory
points.
but
it
is
important
for
our
case
to
recognize
that
the
defendant
carriers
in
official
territory
are
involved
in
both
carriages.
the
new
york
central,
the
central
vermont,
the
--
those
type
of
railroads
necessarily
because
of
where
they're
located,
not
only
are
involved
in
the
carriage
to
official
territory,
but
are
involved
in
the
carriage
to
southern
territory.
now
the
rate
structure
here
which
causes
the
problem
is
one
which
has
been
going
on
for
a
long
time
in
this
area
and
it's
a
structure
whereby
from
canada
to
official
territory,
you
have
joint
through
rates
which
as
this
court
knows
are
an
agreed
rate
usually
cheaper,
in
this
case,
substantially
cheaper,
that
the
pool
rates
you
would
derive
by
merely
taking
an
american
rate
and
a
canadian
rate
and
putting
them
together.
but
the
fact
is
here
that
asbestos
shipped
to
official
territory
goes
by
these
joint
through
rates.
asbestos
shipped
to
southern
territory
does
not
go
by
joint
through
rates.
it
goes
by
combination
rates,
canadian
part
of
it
being
proportional
to
these
interchange
points,
the
american
part
being
local
class
or
commodity
rates
from
newport
and
east
alburgh,
vermont
to
the
various
points
in
southern
territory.
and
the
fact
and
the
result
of
this
difference
in
rate
structure
is
set
out
in
the
opinion
what
i
think
it
can
best
be
seen
by
looking
at
page
79,
the
appendix
to
the
commission's
decision
and
which
sets
forth
in
tabular
form
some
of
the
different
rate
differentials.
if
you
take
the
first
two
columns
which
is
transportation
of
crude
asbestos
from
danville,
quebec
to
these
various
points
and
concentrate
as
i
said
on
ambler
and
charlotte,
you'll
see
that
the
rate
to
ambler,
a
distance
of
529
miles
is
68
cents.
the
rate
to
charlotte
which
is
slightly
less
than
half
--
again,
as
twice
--
be
less
than
twice
the
distance
is
substantially
more
than
twice
as
much
and
if
you
do
the
rest
of
these
calculations
with
this
chart
you
will
find
as
the
commission
found
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
was
page
79
of
the
record,
sir.
it's
an
appendix
which
sets
out
the
various
rates.
you
will
find
that
generally,
there
is
a
discrepancy
here
of
about
15
to
20%
in
the
rates
charged
from
--
to
official
territory
and
the
rates
charged
to
southern
territory.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
before
the
recess,
i
had
outlined
the
facts
of
this
case.
now,
these
facts
are
not
disputed
and
upon
the
basis
of
these
facts,
the
commission
made
a
determination
which
is
also
not
disputed
and
that
is
that
there
was
in
fact
undue
preference
to
the
--
people
in
official
territory
and
in
fact
undue
prejudice
to
the
people
in
southern
territory.
this
conclusion
led
to
an
order
directing
them
to
do
away
with
the
undue
discrimination
and
this
has
been
attacked
solely
on
the
grounds
of
jurisdiction,
the
jurisdictional
issues
of
course
being
whether
the
commission
had
any
jurisdiction
in
this
situation
since
both
--
both
of
the
rates
were
international
rates.
now,
briefly,
on
the
jurisdictional
question
with
respect
to
why
we
don't
believe
the
unreasonableness
part
of
this
case
is
properly
before
the
court.
the
commission's
decision
discusses
the
unreasonableness
of
the
rate
and
its
report,
starting
on
page
61
and
ending
on
page
79,
reaches
the
conclusion
that
the
rate
was
unreasonable
and
also
that
it
would
form
the
basis
of
a
reparations
order.
but
if
you
look
at
the
order
of
the
commission
on
page
81
of
the
record,
you
will
see
that
this
order
is
directed
solely
to
the
question
of
ordering
the
carriers
to
do
away
with
the
prejudicial
rate
structure.
there
is
no
order
directing
the
establishment
of
any
reasonable
rate.
there
is
no
reparations
order.
this
is
not
unusual.
what
the
commission
did
was,
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
and
reparations
point,
it
issued
a
preliminary
determination
here
and
said,
“filed
necessary
information
pursuing
to
rule
1.101
and
subsequently,
will
get
around
to
making
reparations
order.”
therefore,
the
only
final
action
of
the
commission
which
was
before
the
district
court
was
the
action
of
the
court
on
page
81
directing
these
carriers
to
end
the
prejudicial
rate
structure.
the
reasonableness
was
not
before
the
court
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
a
final
reparations
order
had
been
issued,
it
still
couldn't
have
come
before
this
court
because
it's
established
by
united
states
against
i.c.c.
and
other
cases
cited
in
our
brief
that
final
reparations
orders
do
not
go
to
a
three-judge
district
courts
of
the
type
that
we
had
below
here,
they
go
to
single-judge
district
courts.
in
other
words,
to
the
extent
that
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
district
court
here,
purported
to
discuss
to
--
and
find
improper
the
commission's
reasonableness
finding,
they
were
without
jurisdiction
because
there
was
no
final
order
on
the
subject
and
because
there
--
that
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction
if
there
had
been
a
final
order.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
order
of
the
commission,
your
honor,
directs
them
to
eliminate
the
prejudicial
rate.
this
court
has
held
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case
as
you're
aware
that
where
a
commission
order
of
that
nature
is
issued,
there
must
be
an
alternative
available
to
the
railroads.
there
is
such
an
alternative
here.
this
order
doesn't
say
which
they
should
take,
but
they
may
eliminate
this
discrepancy
in
one
of
two
manners.
they
can
withdraw
their
concurrence
to
the
joint
rates
now
in
existence
to
official
territory
which
would
mean
they
would
file
reasonable
and
non-discriminatory
domestic
rates
from
the
border
to
official
territory
points
and
eliminate
the
discrepancy
in
that
way
or
if
they
don't
choose
to
do
that
and
this
is
their
option,
they
can
undo
the
discrimination
by
lowering
their
domestic
rates
now
in
effect
from
the
border
to
southern
territory.
but
they
have
under
this
commission
order
and
this
is
made
perfectly
clear
in
the
supplemental
opinion
that
the
commission
issued
later
on,
they
have
this
option
of
eliminating
this
discrepancy
in
either
way
they
wish.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh
yes,
that's
right.
now,
if
as
we
suggest
you
vacate
the
order
on
reasonableness,
that
order
of
the
district
court
would
not
exist.
presumably
what
would
happen
would
be
that
the
commission,
while
on
the
proper
filings,
would
issue
a
reparations
order
and
if
the
carriers
didn't
choose
to
comply
with
it
under
the
ordinary
procedures,
the
shippers
would
sue
and
then
that
issue
would
be
before
the
court
in
a
proper
manner.
now,
let
me
get
to
the
merits
of
my
jurisdictional
argument
with
respect
to
the
undue
prejudice
business.
the
problem
here,
to
the
extent
there's
a
problem,
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
i
suggest
primarily
is
a
matter
of
constitutional
requirements,
provides
that
the
i.c.c.
does
have
authority
over
international
railroad
transportation
but
only
has
authority,
“but
only
insofar
if
such
transportation
takes
place
within
the
unites
states.”
in
other
words,
it
has
authority
over
international
railroad
transportation
insofar
as
it
takes
place
within
the
united
states.
now,
there
have
been
a
series
of
decisions
in
this
court
of
which
you
will
hear
more
of
later.
the
news
syndicate
case
at
volume
273,
the
lewis-simas-jones
case
at
volume
283,
the
great
northern
versus
sullivan
case
at
volume
294
in
which
this
court
has
passed
upon
what
is
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
determine
and
hold
liable
american
carriers
for
the
unreasonableness
of
an
international
rate.
and
i
think
it
can
be
summed
up
that
the
present
situation
on
reasonableness
is
that
if
the
carriers
enter
into
a
joint
through
rate
voluntarily,
they
are
liable
for
the
reasonableness
of
that
rate,
jointly
and
severally,
with
the
canadian
carriers.
if
instead
they
enter
into
a
combination
rate,
of
the
type
here,
or
rather
they
file
their
tariff
from
the
border
and
the
canadians
file
their
tariff
to
the
border,
then
the
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
the
carriers
usually
are
only
liable
for
the
reasonableness
of
the
part
of
the
order
that
they
have
filed
from
the
border
to
the
american
destinations.
as
because
of
these
findings
in
rate
cases,
presumably
that
the
district
court
thought
the
only
issue
in
the
case,
and
this
appears
on
page
272
of
the
record,
the
only
issue
in
the
entire
case
was
whether
the
commission
had
jurisdiction
over
the
portion
of
the
transportation
between
the
canadian
mines
and
newport
and
east
alburgh,
vermont.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
page
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
--
i'm
sorry,
i
mean
242,
sir,
quite
right.
you
see
the
--
the
district
court
starts
off
its
opinion
saying,
“a
single
question
is
presented,
does
the
commission
have
jurisdiction
over
the
foreign
factor
because
it
involves
transportation
within
the
united
states?”
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
an
--
an
issue,
maybe
a
decisive
issue.
certainly,
an
important
issue
in
deciding
whether
the
commission
could
find
that
the
international
rate
itself
here
was
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
but
we
submit
that
that
isn't
the
problem
and
that
is
out
of
the
case
and
the
question
is
not
whether
a
rate
is
reasonable
or
not
but
whether
the
relationship
between
two
rates
is
such
that
they
cause
undue
discrimination
within
the
united
states.
because
the
old
case
in
this
court,
united
states
against
illinois
central
at
volume
263,
makes
perfectly
clear
that
even
though
both
of
two
rates
are
reasonable
and
even
though
some
of
the
carriers
participating
in
these
rates
are
beyond
the
commission's
jurisdiction,
that
if
one
or
more
carriers
that
are
part
of
both
rates,
have
it
within
their
power
to
alleviate
the
discrepancy
that
the
commission
has
it
within
its
power
to
order
that
discrepancy
be
--
be
alleviated,
then
what
is
the
jurisdictional
question
here,
the
real
jurisdictional
question?
well,
i
presume
there
are
two
possibilities.
the
first
question
would
be,
“is
the
commission
estopped
form
looking
into
this
situation
at
all
merely
because
these
two
rates
happen
to
be
international
rates?
does
the
fact
that
the
joint
through
rate
is
an
international
rate
and
the
combination
through
rate
is
an
international
rate
estop
the
commission
from
looking
at
the
situation
at
all?”
the
other
question
presumably
would
be,
“if
--
if
they
can
look
at
it
and
find
what's
obviously
true
that
they
do
result
in
discrimination,
can
they
do
anything
about
it
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states?”
as
i
understand
the
argument
of
the
railroads,
their
argument
is
primarily
the
first.
they
say
that
we
have
the
right
to
file
a
local
u.s.
tariff
from
the
border
to
the
various
points
of
destination
in
the
united
states
and
if
we
do
that,
we're
only
liable
for
the
reasonableness
of
that
rate.
and
therefore,
you
cannot
look
to
the
international
rate
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
because
we're
not
liable,
they
say,
for
the
reasonableness
of
the
international
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
is
none
and
as
far
as
the
undue
prejudice
is
concerned
--
well,
let
me
go
back
briefly.
you
said
the
u.s.
portion,
i
don't
want
to
misstate
it
from
the
standpoint
of
my
colleagues
here,
the
argument
maybe
as
to
what
is
the
u.s.
portion,
but
there
is
no
argument
that
the
rates
from
newport
at
east
alburgh
to
southern
territory
are
unreasonable.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
your
honor
there
isn't
and
--
and
there
couldn't
be
such
a
finding
because
the
discrimination
isn't
because
of
any
theoretical
transportation
from
the
border
or
these
vermont
points
to
official
territory
of
the
south.
the
discrimination
is
on
through
routes
paid
for
one
time
from
the
quebec
points
either
to
official
territory
or
the
quebec
points
to
southern
territory.
the
discrimination
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
we
have
a
joint
though
rate
which
mr.
mcdonald
admits
they're
entirely
liable
for,
a
joint
through
rate
to
official
territory,
but
a
refusal
to
enter
into
joint
through
rates
to
southern
territory.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
it's
very
much
in
contest.
mr.
mcdonald
would
like
to
forget
about
it.
mr.
mcdonald
says
the
only
thing
in
contest
is
the
rate
to
southern
territory,
but
of
course,
that
misses
the
whole
point
your
honor.
undue
prejudice
cannot
be
caused
by
one
thing.
it's
a
relationship
of
two
rates.
the
undue
prejudice
here
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
joint
through
rates
to
official
territory
is
prejudicial
when
contrasted
with
the
absence
of
a
joint
through
rate
to
southern
territory.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there's
no
finding
that
either
of
these
rates
--
well,
now,
excuse
me,
there
is
no
finding
that
the
joint
through
rate
as
such
is
unreasonable,
but
you
may
have
prejudice,
your
honor
even
if
you
have
two
rates
which
in
and
of
themselves
are
reasonable.
reasonableness
is
arranged.
you
may
have
two
rates
which
considered
alone
are
perfectly
reasonable
and
still
cause
a
prejudice
which
the
commission
has
authority
to
undo.
so
when
you
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
prejudice
which
has
been
found,
your
honor
is
that
it
costs
less
to
ship
this
asbestos
to
places
in
pennsylvania
or
chicago
or
in
the
northeast
territory
than
it
does
to
--
to
ship
it
to
southern
territory
and
not
only
less
because
of
the
distance
and
space,
but
less
because
of
the
preferential
rate
structure.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
railroads
get
the
money
for
the
rate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
divide
it
but
the
railroads
have
agreed
among
themselves
to
a
preferential
rate
to
official
territory.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
canadian
railroad.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
to
a
preferential
rate
to
official
territory
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
which
they
are
unwilling
to
agree
to
for
as
far
as
southern
territory
is
concerned
and
the
commission
has
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
and
not
only
less
because
of
distances
but
less
because
of
the
rate
structure
itself.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
because
they
fixed
it
that
way
and
the
commission
has
said
“unfix
it”
and
they
say,
either
do
away
--
you
can
take
your
choice
as
to
how
you
undue
it
but
undo
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
absolute.
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
you
cannot
know
what
a
joint
through
rate
to
california
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
would
be
because
that's
a
matter
of
agreement.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
--
but
let
me
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
i
can
answer
that
very
quickly
because
the
commission
has
no
authority
to
order
these
carriers
to
enter
into
a
joint
through
rate
with
the
canadians
and
they
haven't
ordered
them
to
do
so.
now,
conceivably,
they
could
--
could
do
so,
but
the
commission
can't
order
them
to
do
that
because
the
commission
cannot
go
beyond
its
borders
and
require
the
canadian
companies
to
enter
into
an
--
a
joint
agreement
with
the
american
companies.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
ordered
the
american
companies
to
remove
this
discrimination
and
if
they
don't
do
what
justice
brennan
was
suggesting
but
which
we
can't
order
them
to
do,
they
can
do
it
by
two
ways
that
we
can
order
them
to
do.
one,
they
can
remove
the
joint
through
rate
to
official
territory,
put
both
rates
on
a
par,
both
combination
rates
or
two,
within
the
existing
rate
structure,
they
can
cut
down
on
the
part
of
the
combination
rate
that
they
charge
to
southern
territories,
cut
their
rate
form
the
border
to
the
southern
territories
and
equalize
in
that
manner.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
can't
--
okay,
i
won't
say
it's
lawfully
been
entered
into.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
such.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
cannot
order
the
american
railroads
to
enter
into
a
joint
rate
with
canada.
it
can
order
the
american
railroads
to
remove
themselves
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
from
the
joint.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right,
no
question.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
agree
with
that
sir
because
if
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
--
i
can't
agree
with
that
premise.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
it
can
but
in
part.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
can
in
part
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
it
can
compel
the
abolition.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
it
were
not
for
the
decision
of
this
court,
a
five
to
four
decision
of
this
court
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case
in
294
u.s.,
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
clearly,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
no,
no
this
(inaudible)
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
you
don't
have
to.
the
texas
and
pacific
case
said
that
where
you
are
directing
an
american
carrier
to
alleviate
an
undue
prejudice,
you
must
give
them
an
option
as
to
how
they
alleviate
it.
you
mustn't
just
say
cut
down
this
rate
or
you
mustn't
say
just
raise
this
rate,
you
must
give
them
an
option.
now,
the
commission
can
and
has
given
an
option
of
that
very
nature
in
this
case
because
they
do
have
an
option
to
cut
down
the
higher
rate
by
cutting
down
their
domestic
rates
from
the
border
and
they
do
have
an
option
of
raising
the
lower
rate
by
withdrawing
from
the
joint
rates.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
we'd
still
have
to
give
them
this
option
in
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
oh
yes,
yes
sir.
if
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
you
deal
with
it
in
many
ways.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
the
issue,
right.
that's
the
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i'm
sorry.
it
cannot
deal
with
it
in
one
particular
manner.
it
could
otherwise
deal
with
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
it
can
--
it
can
certainly
deal
with
joint
rates
coming
from
canada.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
it
cannot
order
a
joint
rate,
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
exactly
and
we
say
that
there
isn't
any
jurisdictional
problem
because
in
doing
so,
it
doesn't
have
to
go
beyond
the
borders
of
the
united
states
except
to
look
at
the
rates
which
are
filed
within
the
united
states,
in
that
sense,
it's
going
beyond
the
borders
but
all
of
these
various
cases
if
you
look
at
them
go
beyond
the
borders
to
look
and
see
what
the
international
joint
rate
is.
other
than
that,
it
is
merely
ordering
american
carriers
to
take
action
within
america
which
is
action
unilateral
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
action
that
the
canadian
carriers
have
to
have
anything
to
do
with
to
alleviate
this
rate.
and
we
say
that
that
does
not
cause
any
jurisdictional
problem.
that
is
the
regulation
of
an
international
rate
insofar
as
it
takes
place
within
the
united
states
but
i
have
to
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
question
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
we
don't
think
that's
the
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
what
the
district
court
thought
was
the
issue.
we
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
either
didn't
deal
with
it
or
dealt
with
it
incorrectly.
i
think
it
really
didn't
deal
with
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
excuse
me.
[laughs]
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
don't
think
that
that
has
any
relationship
to
our
problem
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
the
question
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
and
the
answer
is
yes
because
they
can
do
it
within
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
canadian
carrier
is
transporting
asbestos
from
mines
to
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
actually,
they
don't.
they
only
have
a
proportional
rate
which
is
only
for
going
further
on
but
it
--
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
if
it
was
to
the
border,
it
wouldn't.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
is
true
as
a
fact.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
let
me
give
you
an
example,
another
case
of
this
court,
the
saint
louis
brownsville
railway
against
the
brownsville
district
case.
there,
the
problem
was
whether
a
carrier
should
be
required
to
provide
cars
from
brownsville
across
the
mexican
border.
and
it
was
argued
that
it
should
do
so
because
it
was
providing
cars
from
a
couple
of
other
ports.
well,
justice
butler
speaking
for
this
court
said
in
that
case,
of
course
that
we
have
no
authority,
nobody
has
any
authority
to
require
these
carriers
to
provide
cars
across
the
mexican
border.
but
if
they
provide
them
for
one
shipper,
then
we
have
a
discrimination
problem.
we
have
the
same
thing
here.
these
people
aren't
under
any
obligation
to
enter
into
a
joint
route
to
southern
territory
and
they're
under
no
obligation
to
--
not
enter
into
a
joint
route
to
official
territory.
but
if
they
voluntarily
act
and
their
voluntary
actions
within
their
control
produce
a
discriminatory
situation
then
the
commission
has
authority
to
do
something
about
it.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
exactly.
what
these
gentlemen
are
asking
is
the
right
to
completely
discriminate
between
sections
of
the
country
as
long
as
its
international
trail.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
mr.
chief
justice,
do
we
have
any
time
left?
