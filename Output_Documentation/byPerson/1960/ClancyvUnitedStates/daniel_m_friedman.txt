mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
case
basically
is
about
two
questions,
i
would
say.
first,
whether
there
was
a
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant
not
whether
in
fact
the
crimes
alleged
to
have
been
committed
in
the
search
warrant
were
committed.
that's
the
first
question.
whether
there
was
a
probable
cause,
whether
if
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
the
seized
property
was
properly
seized
as
the
instrumentalities
of
the
crime
for
which
there
was
alleged
to
be
probable
cause
in
the
search
warrant.
and
three,
assuming
those
two
questions
are
answered
affirmatively,
as
we
believe,
whether
there
was
anything
wrong
in
the
fact
that
the
crime
for
which
these
people
were
convicted
and
for
which
this
evidence
was
introduced
was
not
the
same
crime
alleged
in
the
search
warrant.
that's
the
first
question,
which
i
proposed
to
discuss
first.
and
the
second
question
relates
to
the
nonproduction
on
the
court,
as
shown
by
the
record,
of
the
statements
of
three
of
the
government
witnesses.
and
i
might,
by
way
of
anticipating,
state
that
despite
the
affidavits,
the
government
does
adhere
to
the
position
taken
in
its
brief
that
this
matter
should
be
remanded
to
the
lower
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
--
no,
mr.
justice,
we
have
not
but
we
have
--
i
have
personally,
on
the
basis
of
this
brief
which
was
received
thursday,
made
some
further
inquiries
which
i
will
explain
to
the
court
when
i
come
to
that
point.
now,
i
would
like
first
to
deal
with
the
statutes
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
talking
now
--
addressing
myself
the
question
of
probable
cause.
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
i
--
i
think
i
--
i'd
like
to
answer
it
right
now.
i
think
because
in
this
case,
the
basis
on
which
the
government
attained
the
search
warrant
was
not
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
these
people
were
not
paying
the
full
10%
tax
on
the
wages
but
that
at
these
particular
premises
over
the
tavern
that
was
being
conducted
a
wagering
operation
which
had
not
been
registered
and
on
which
the
tax
had
not
been
paid.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
but
--
but
that
is,
as
we
think,
is
a
significant
thing
in
this
case
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
obtaining
the
search
warrant
on
the
basis
of
what
the
internal
revenue
agents
had
discovered
about
these
premises.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
(inaudible)
yes.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
--
that
is
correct
because
of
the
congressional
provision
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
imposing
certain
requirements
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--people
engaging
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
in
the
business
of
accepting
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
only
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
only,
mr.
justice,
but
--
but
there
is
the
protection
that
the
citizen
is
protected
in
this
because
a
search
warrant
cannot
be
issued
except
upon
probable
cause
to
believe
that
what
is
alleged
in
the
search
warrant
has
in
fact
happened.
in
other
words,
they
can't
just
go
in
and
say,
"we
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
citizen
is
concealing
his
income
tax,
therefore,
give
us
a
search
warrant
unless
they
have
some
basis
for
this
allegation."
and
furthermore
this
is
the
protection
that
the
property
seized
must
be
the
instrumentalities
used
in
committing
the
offense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
rather
doubt
it,
mr.
justice,
because
this
would
turn
on
whether
the
securities
involved
were
conceived
to
be
the
instrumentalities
of
committing
the
offense
or
merely
the
evidence.
and
i
would
say
that
in
that
case,
for
all
that
was
involved
was
the
filing
of
a
false
return.
in
that
case,
the
instrumentality
used
for
committing
the
offense
is
the
return
itself
and
you
could
not,
on
the
basis
of
a
search
warrant,
obtain
evidence
to
prove
the
falsity
of
the
statement.
for
that,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
not,
i
think,
the
problem
we
have
before
us
in
this
case
because
i
like
to
come
again
--
return
to
the
statute
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
now,
section
4412
which
we
have
set
forth
at
page
56
of
our
brief
is
the
provision
requiring
registration
and
it
states
that
each
person
required
to
pay
a
special
tax
under
this
subchapter.
and
the
special
tax
is
referred
to
in
the
previous
section
4411
which
is
the
special
tax
of
$50
to
be
paid
by
each
person
who
is
liable
for
the
10%
excise
tax
on
wager.
4412
says
that
each
person
required
to
pay
the
special
tax
shall
register
with
the
appropriate
official
his
name
and
place
of
residents
and
then
if
he
is
liable
for
tax
under
subchapter
a.
in
other
words,
if
somebody
is
liable
for
a
tax
--
the
excise
tax
on
wagers,
someone
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers,
he
is
to
register
each
place
of
business
where
the
activity
which
makes
him
liable
is
carried
on.
so
that
what
we
have
in
this
statute
is
the
registration
requirement
is
not
a
general
registration
but
to
register
and
to
register
with
certain
specific
information.
and
some
of
that
informa
--
one
important
element
of
information
is
that
each
place
where
this
business
is
carried
on
be
registered.
now,
in
this
case,
the
search
warrant
filed
by
the
agent
which
had
attached
to
it
seven
other
search
warrants
of
other
internal
revenue
service
agents
showed
the
following.
first,
the
internal
revenue
agent
who
is
in
charge
of
the
collection
division
which
had
control
of
registrations
under
this
statute
for
this
area
testified
in
his
affidavit
stated
that
there
was
no
record
of
any
registration
for
these
particular
premises,
2300a
state
street,
the
second
floor
over
the
top
and
he
so
unequivocally
stated.
so
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
internal
revenue
agent
and
the
district
judge,
it
was
clear
that
there
was
no
record
of
a
registration
for
these
premises.
now,
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
the
next
question
is,
did
the
remaining
affidavits
give
reasonable
cause
for
belief
that
in
fact
a
wagering
operation
was
being
conducted
at
this
premise?
and
we
submit
that
these
affidavits
did
afford
a
reasonable
basis.
in
addition
to
the
material
that's
--
petitioners'
counsel
has
referred
to
the
internal
revenue
agent
himself
who
made
the
primary
affidavit
stated
that
on
one
occasion,
in
addition
of
placing
bets,
he
had
seen
a
woman
come
in
and
give
some
--
give
some
--
some
money
to
the
bartender
and
the
bartender
went
and
placed
it
in
a
stairwell
that
led
up
to
the
second
floor.
he
waited
a
few
minutes
and
then
he
said
to
the
bartender,
"i
have
some
money
coming
from
me,"
because
he
had
previously
placed
a
bet
and
won.
the
bartender
said,
"just
a
minute,"
and
he
went
open
the
stairwell.
he
took
out
an
envelope
with
$9.60
and
gave
it
to
him
in
his
winnings
on
a
previous
bet.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
an
affidavit
by
another
agent
that
he
had
interviewed
certain
well-known
bookmakers
in
a
town
in
the
vicinity
called
collinsville.
and
these
bookmakers
testify
--
stated
they
picked
up
wagers
at
a
certain
tavern.
and
there's
further
indication,
further
show
that
an
examination
of
the
telephone
company
records
indicated
that
a
number
of
telephone
calls
had
been
made
from
this
tavern
to
the
upstairs
premises
where
the
raid
took
place.
now,
we
don't
say
that
this
established
in
fact
that
this
crime
had
been
committed.
that's
not
the
standard.
the
standard
is
that
probable
cause
was
there
--
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
conclusion
by
the
district
judge
which
he
found
in
the
search
warrant
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
premises
were
being
used
in
violation
of
federal
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
had
specified
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
the
operation?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think,
because
in
that
case,
there
would
have
been
no
reasonable
basis
to
assume
the
operation
is
being
conducted
at
those
premises.
but
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
significance
of
at
large
is
this.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
unclear
from
the
record.
we
don't
know
when
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
first
of
all,
it's
ambiguous
there
because
it
states
on
the
one
hand,
it
gives
as
the
business
address,
both
the
address
of
the
petitioner
clancy
which
says
"at
large
-
2401
ridge
avenue,
east
st.
louis,
illinois".
but
mr.
justice,
we
don't
think
this
makes
any
difference
because
the
concept
of
an
at
large
operation
is
where
they
have
no
place
of
business.
this
is
to
deal
with
the
case
of
a
man
who
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
and
he's
wondering
around.
he
picks
up
a
better
two
at
boot
black
stand,
he
perhaps
goes
into
different
restaurants,
he
may
go
into
a
drugstore
on
the
corner.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
he
has
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
the
--
the
provision
relating
to
the
posting
of
the
wagering
stamp.
it
specifically
states
that
he
shall
keep
the
stamp
posted
in
his
principle
place
of
business
except
that
he
has
no
such
place
of
business,
he
shall
keep
his
stamp
on
his
purse.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
the
--
our
point
on
this
is
that
what
the
record
showed
here
as
far
as
the
district
judge
was
concerned
when
he
executed
the
search
warrant,
but
this
didn't
appear
to
be
in
at
large
operation,
this
appeared
to
be
a
going
operation
as
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
--
the
whole
concept
of
the
at
large
operation
is
to
deal
with
the
man
who
has
no
principle
place
of
business
and
where
you
have
a
principle
place
of
business
--
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
the
whole
purpose
of
making
you
registered
as
so
the
people
can
find
out
what's
going
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
into
--
no,
there
is
no
reference.
this
is
a
--
a
phrase
that
apparently
has
crept
into
it
as
a
matter
of
practice.
and
of
course,
if
you
register
and
show
that
you're
operating
at
large,
it
maybe
very
difficult
for
the
government
to
ascertain
where
your
operations
are
being
conducted
and
by
the
same
token
makes
it
very
difficult
to
point
out
the
true
extent
of
your
operations.
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
the
"at
large"
concept
should
be
limited
to
the
true
case
of
an
"at
large"
operation.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so
but
i
think
it's
the
administrative
practice
to
accept
applications
where
it
appears
to
be
a
truly
at
large
operation.
now,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
argument
which
petitioner
has
advanced
that
the
fact
that
he
had
a
stamp
ment
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
this
warrant.
the
stamp
merely
referred
to
the
north
sales
company,
the
three
petitioners
doing
business
as
the
north
sales
company
and
gave
the
address
shown
of
petitioner
clancy's
residence.
that
is
set
forth
at
page
14
of
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2401
ridge
avenue,
which
is
the
same
address
shown
on
the
second
line
of
their
application
after
the
words
"at
large"
and
that
is
the
home
address
of
petitioner
clancy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
infer
that
from
the
fact
on
line
four
where
it
goes
down
thomas
clancy
that
shows
the
same
address.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
under
the
home
address
and
of
course,
it's
perfectly
--
it
would
be
consistent
that
a
business
might
be
operating
out
of
the
home
address.
so
there
might
be
situations
where
the
home
address
would
also
be
the
principle
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
we
draw
that
inference
and
they
state
that
this
is
the
home
address
and
we
don't
question
that.
but
our
point
is
that
whether
it's
the
home
address
or
not
and
whether
mr.
clancy
was
or
was
not
conducting
operations
from
that
premise
is
immaterial
because
the
critical
thing
is
that
the
premises
where
the
search
was
made
are
premises
where
the
business
was
being
conducted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
2300a
state
street,
above
the
tavern.
now,
there
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
he
should
have
put
that
address
and
also
in
line
two
where
he
states
again
his
business
address.
if
he
had
done
that,
if
he
had
stated
that
they
were
operating
at
2300a
state
street
as
their
principle
place
of
business,
there
would
plainly
have
been
no
basis
for
the
showing
made
in
the
warrant
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
unregistered
business
was
operating
illegally
at
these
premises
because
it
would
then
be
a
registered
business
at
these
premises.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
have
this
evidence.
we
have
the
evidence
that
mr.
heckelbech
who
testified
that
he
would
not
accept
this
kind
of
an
application
because
you
couldn't
operate
both
at
large
and
with
a
business
address
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice.
that's
at
page
86.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
should
--
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that
is
correct.
he
should
have
put
down
his
principal
place
of
business
when
they
were
operating.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
and
in
any
event,
he
certainly
was
required
specifically
to
put
down
his
principal
place
of
business
and
we
think
all
of
it.
we
--
i
don't
think
we
have
to
decide
whether
2300a
was
--
it
was
not
their
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
is
in
the
regula
--
the
--
the
words
"principal
place
of
business"
arise
in
the
provisional
relating
to
the
posting
of
the
tax
stamp
in
section
6806
at
page
57
of
our
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
57.
this
relates
that
the
stamp
is
to
be
posted
in
the
principal
place
of
business
but
section
4412
states
that
the
registration
shall
specify
each
place
of
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
might
--
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
suppose
they
would
well
be.
sure,
there
are
many
people
in
the
wagering
business
who
don't
have
any
fixed
place
who
just
--
you
know
that
if
you
want
to
place
a
wager,
you
can
get
in
touch
with
someone
and
you'll
find
them
around
14th
(inaudible)
or
something
like
that.
now,
the
warrant
in
this
case
was
not
directed
to
seizing
any
of
petitioner's
books
and
record
to
it
directed
to
seizing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
this
might
be
--
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
because
mr.
waller,
their
accountant
who
prepared
the
return
testified
that
it
was
not
returned
to
him.
and
it's
the
--
there
is
--
but
i
think
the
fact
that
the
stamp
gives
us
the
address
not
"at
large"
but
the
2401
address
indicates,
we
suggest,
that
these
people
were
accepting
the
stamp
on
that
basis.
now,
i'd
like
also
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
far
as
i
know
that
is
the
significant
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that's
why
the
man
who
has
no
particular
place
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
of
business
that
he
calls
his
place
of
business
that
is
his
place
of
business.
i
--
i'd
like
to
also
refer
the
court
to
the
affidavit
of
agent
johnson
at
page
6.
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
which
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
shows
clearly
that
at
the
time
this
search
warrant
was
obtained,
the
agents
did
not
know
that
north
sales
company
was
operating
here
because
he
says,
"the
failure
to
file
the
special
tax
return
in
the
name
of
the
operator
of
said
business,
namely
one
john
doe."
and
when
we
look
at
this
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
district
judge
who
issued
the
search
warrant,
it
seems
that
he
was
fully
justified
in
concluding
that
unknown
persons
were
conducting
this
wagering
operation
on
the
premises.
and
that
these
premises
had
not
been
registered
as
required
by
law.
and
that
we
think
is
sufficient
under
this
court
--
this
court
--
decisions
of
this
court
to
just
constitute
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
the
warrant.
and
we
think
that
once
this
standard
of
probable
cause
has
been
satisfied
when
the
motion
to
suppress
is
made,
the
ultimate
correctness
of
the
things
alleged
for
probable
cause
should
not
be
tried
out
in
other
words,
if
probable
cause
exist
at
the
time
the
warrant
is
issued,
the
probable
cause
does
not
disappear
because
of
the
claim
that
additional
facts
show
there
was
not
--
the
facts
were
not
as
had
been
assumed
to
be
at
the
time
the
warrant
was
issued
in
the
same
way
that
a
search
is
good
or
bad
depending
on
what
happen
at
the
time,
it
is
not
validated
or
invalidated
by
what
later
turns
up.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
i
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
cases
but
i
think
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
cases
which
deals
specifically
with
the
question
of
attempting
to
claim
that
the
probable
cause
alleged
to
exist
did
not
exist
but
in
the
broader
that
the
general
proposition
has
been
stated
many
times
by
this
court
and
other
courts.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
yes,
i
would
think,
mr.
justice,
that
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
get
a
search
warrant
for
24
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you
hypothetically.the
same
facts
that
you
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
have
to
inquire
one
further
thing,
mr.
justice,
in
your
hypothetical
was
there
also
an
affidavit
from
the
collector
of
the
district
that,
in
fact,
there
was
no
registration
for
2401.
i
think
that
is
the
crucial
thing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
registration.
you
see,
in
this
case,
there
was
an
affidavit
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
a
registration
and
payment
of
tax.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'll
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
would
think,
mr.
justice,
there
would
have
to
be
some
basis
in
the
affidavits
for
the
conclusion
that,
in
fact,
no
registration
had
been
filed
for
a
particular
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
--
no,
mr.
--
in
this
case,
it's
much
stronger
than
that.
in
this
case,
there's
an
unequivocal
affidavit
by
mr.
heckelbech
that
there
was
no
registration
at
all
for
the
premises
at
2300a
state
street.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
now,
if
all
we
--
if
all
we
have
was
a
statement
that
it
was
believed
to
be
a
--
a
wagering
operation
at
2401,
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
sufficient
probable
cause
without
some
further
indications,
some
further
affidavit
that
there
had
been
no
registration
for
those
premises.
but
that
--
that
is
not
this
case
because
in
this
case,
we
do
have
an
affidavit
that
the
premises
for
which
the
search
warrant
was
issued
had
in
--
had,
in
fact,
no
registration,
had
been
filed
for
those
premises.
now,
i
want
to
just
reiterate
again
the
statute
requires
a
registration
of
each
premises.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
my
point
was
that
if
in
fact
there
was
no
basis
on
what
was
before
the
district
judge
for
concluding
that
these
premises
had
not
been
registered,
then
i
think
there
wouldn't
be
probable
cause.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
so,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i
think
if
--
if
that
were
the
case,
someone
may
have
filed
the
false
affidavit
which
is
another
crime
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
probable
cause
would
appear.
that's
correct.
i
mean
the
--
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice,
because
i
think
the
whole
purpose
of
the
probable
cause
requirement
is
to
ensure
that
between
the
citizen
and
the
searching
and
seizing
officers
that
there
is
the
magistrate
who
is
--
has
an
opportunity
to
examine
as
to
protect
the
people
against
laws
and
if
in
fact
a
false
statement
is
made
to
the
magistrate,
there
are
other
remedies,
otherwise,
you
can
check
in
every
case
for
which
an
attack
was
made
on
a
search
warrant.
it
has
been
suggest
you
have
to
try
out
all
these
collateral
issues.
now,
we,
therefore
--
we
think
have
reached
the
point
as
far
as
our
argument
is
concern
that
the
search
warrant
was
issued
on
probable
cause.
the
next
question,
as
we
see
it,
is
whether,
in
these
circumstances,
they
were
justified
in
seizing
the
property.
now,
the
property
that
was
seized
in
this
case
is
precisely
the
property
set
forth
in
the
search
warrant
as
the
various
records
specified
used
in
the
conduct
--
the
conduct
of
this
alleged
illegal
operations.
set
forth
at
page
20
of
the
record,
books,
memoranda,
tickets,
pads,
tablets,
papers,
recording
of
the
receipt
of
money,
receptacles
in
the
nature
of
envelopes
in
which
there
is
kept
money
won
by
patrons
and
diverse
other
tools,
currency
and
records,
all
designed
for
the
use
in
violating
these
laws.
now,
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
the
instrumentalities
used
in
committing
an
offense
as
distinct
from
mere
evidence
of
that
offense
are
properly
subject
to
seizure.
and
in
the
marron
case,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
category
of
seizable
items
as
instrumentalities
is
not
limited
to
those
used
to
carry
on
the
criminal
enterprise
but
also
those
so
closely
related
to
the
business
but
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
consider
them
as
used
to
carry
it
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
think
--
think
so,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
--
it
might
be
--
i
would
think
the
better
course
would
be
and
i
am
told
that
in
--
if
that
situation
occurs,
the
general
practice
is
to
check
back.
but
i
think
again,
if
he's
got
a
search
warrant
that
he
is
justified
in
executing
the
search
warrant.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
certainly,
i
think
so.
now,
this
court
has
stated
in
the
lewis
case
that
the
various
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
dealing
with
the
wagering
tax
and
the
special
$50
tax
for
engaging
in
this
business
together
with
another
provision,
which
we,
unfortunately,
have
not
cited
in
our
brief
but
which
petitioners
have
filed
in
their
reply
brief,
at
page
17
which
is
4109
of
the
code
which
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
engaged
in
or
carry
on
any
trade
or
business
subject
to
the
$50
wagering
tax
unless
he
has
paid
that
tax.
these
--
these
provisions
carried
to
--
read
together
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
lewis
case
indicate
that
the
$50
tax
is
a
registration
fee
that
must
be
paid
before
engaging
in
a
business
of
wagering.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
read
together
this
various
provisions
indicate
that
the
operation
of
an
unregistered
business
is
in
violation
of
federal
law.
and
we
think
the
material
which
was
seized
here,
the
very
paraphernalia
used
in
carrying
on
the
business,
the
pieces
of
paper
on
which
the
bets
were
recorded,
the
daily
record
of
the
particular
intake
and
outtake,
these
were
the
instrumentalities
used
in
conducting
this
business
that
isn't
conducting
the
wagering
business.
and
since
at
the
time
of
the
search
warrant
was
issued,
this
business
had
appeared
had
not
been
registered
in
accordance
with
the
federal
law.
we
think
this
were
properly
seizable
as
the
instrumentalities
used
in
carrying
on
this
illegal
operation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
mean
if
they
were
2401
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
i
would
say,
mr.
justice,
there's
still
warrant
to
seizing
what
the
warrant
commands
them
to
see.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
they
would
--
they
would
be
the
instrumentalities
for
carrying
on
a
business
which
there
was
probable
cause
at
the
time
the
search
warrant
was
issued
to
believe
was
being
carried
on
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
--
in
--
it
would
be
illegal
from
the
point
of
view
of
--
as
of
the
time
the
search
warrant
was
issued.
there
would
be
probable
cause.
in
other
words,
again,
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice,
if
i
may,
that
when
an
agent
comes
to
serve
a
search
warrant
and
directs
him
to
seize
particular
property,
i
don't
think
at
this
point,
he
has
to
look
around
and
say,
"well,
in
fact,
is
the
business
being
conducted
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he's
--
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may
or
may
not
be
depending
on
who
is
--
who
is
conducting
this
particular
business.i
mean,
it
maybe
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
mr.
justice,
they
may
--
sorry.
on
your
hypothetical,
they
have
not
committed
the
crime
of
conducting
the
unlawful
operation.
but
i
think
that
they
are
still
justified
in
seizing
the
property.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
only
if
there's
probable
cause
to
believe
this
is
an
unlawful
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
can't
--
they
can't
use
it.
the
man
has
committed
no
crime
in
conduct
--
in
other
words,
there
wouldn't
be
any
possible
prosecution
for
the
unlawful
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think
that
problem
has
come
up
because
i
--
i
don't
know
of
a
--
of
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
certainly
is
not
here.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
refer
briefly
to
one
other
point.
they
have
consistently
argued
that
there
is
--
that
this
people,
in
fact,
were
not
using
2300a
state
street
as
their
principle
place
of
business.
in
our
view,
we
don't
think
this
makes
any
difference
as
long
as
there
was
probable
cause
at
the
time
to
believe
there
were
but
we
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
record
in
this
case
where
there
is,
we
think,
abundant
evidence
that,
in
fact,
once
the
trial
took
place
that
this
was
being
used
for
that
purpose.
i
refer
specifically
to
the
testimony
at
pages
121
to
126
of
the
record
involving
certain
statements
as
to
how
this
particular
business
was
being
operated.
now,
the
final
point
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
what
they
were
operating
--
we
think
this
shows
they
were
operating
maybe
even
in
their
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
not
make
any
--
it
would
not
make
any
difference.
it's
certainly
clear
they
were
conducting
a
regular
operation
from
this
place.
and
the
final
point
which
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
and
we
think
it's
fully
covered
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
that
once
the
original
search
and
seizure
were
valid,
the
fact
that
the
offenses
for
which
the
evidence
was
introduced
are
not
the
same
offenses
as
those
alleged
in
the
search
warrant
is
immaterial
even
that
was
specifically
ruled
by
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
we
have
quoted
in
our
brief
at
pages
40
to
42
and
also
recently
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
i
would
now
like
to
turn
to
the
second
issue
on
this
case
which
the
question
of
the
nonproduction
of
the
agents
in
courts.
this
involves
the
testimony
of
three
internal
revenue
service
agents
concerning
certain
conversations
they
had
or
overheard
with
the
defendants.
in
each
case,
as
far
as
the
record
is
specific,
and
i'll
develop
in
a
moment,
i
think
it
is
ambiguous
on
one
of
them,
the
trial
court
directed
the
turning
over
where
they
were
available
of
the
handwritten
notes
of
the
agent
but
refused
to
direct
production
of
the
agent's
memoranda
or
reports
based
upon
those
notes.
and
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
this
was
an
erroneous
principle
of
law
as
we
had
previously
explained
to
the
court
last
term
in
the
needleman
case.
we
think
that
if
it
is
a
report
in
writing
signed
by
the
agent,
it
is
producible
under
the
jencks
act
even
though
the
fact
that
the
agent
who
testified
and
made
the
report
is
a
government
witness.
however,
our
position
is
that
although
these
rulings
were
erroneous
in
the
case
of
one
witness,
the
man
named
minton,
this
was
not
prejudicial
error.
and
with
respect
to
the
other
two
witnesses
with
whom
the
--
concerning
whom
the
affidavit
has
been
filed,
we
think
that
there
is
sufficient
doubt
on
the
base
that
we
have
of
this
record
that
we
--
we
understand
according
to
our
information
that,
in
fact,
we
believe
these
reports
were
turned
over
but
we
think
on
this
basis
that
matter
should
be
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
a
hearing.
now,
i
like
to
discuss
first
this
agent
named
minton.
minton's
testimony
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
let
--
let
me
explain,
mr.
chief
justice
precisely
how
this
came
into
the
case,
what
we
did
and
what
our
information
is.
at
the
time
when
the
government
was
preparing
its
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
case
in
september,
we
wrote
to
the
united
states
attorney
requesting
him
to
furnish
us
with
copies
of
the
various
notes
and
memoranda
that
had
been
made.
and
he
wrote
us
back
a
letter
on
the
date
of
september
26,
1960
in
which
he
gave
us
this
information
at
the
last
paragraph
of
the
letter
added
the
statement
that
these
documents
had
actually
been
turned
over
to
the
defense
during
the
trial
that
carbon
copies
of
those
have
been
turned
over.
we
then
had
a
series
of
letters
back
and
forth.
and
there
were
five
letters
in
which
the
united
states
attorney
advised
us
of
the
fact.
they
were
based
--
his
statement
was
based
principally
on
what
had
been
related
to
him
by
mr.
mochel,
one
of
the
two
agents,
who,
according
to
his
information,
had
turned
the
documents
over.
and
mr.
mochel
stated
in
--
sorry.
mr.
raymour
(ph)
of
the
united
states
attorney
advised
us
that
mr.
mochel
had
told
him
that
at
the
time
he
was
on
the
stand,
he
had
in
his
inside
"pocket”
folded
carbon
copies
of
these
typed
documents.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
information,
we
prepared
our
brief
in
the
form
that
it
was
filed
with
this
court
and
sent
a
copy
to
the
united
states
attorney
before
filing
and
he
approved
it.
i
received
the
defendants
--
petitioners'
brief
last
thursday.
and
upon
receipt
of
it,
i
have
made
some
further
inquiries.
now,
due
to
the
shortness
of
time,
we
have
been
unable
to
file
anything
with
this
--
this
court.
the
principal
man
involved
mr.
mochel,
the
internal
revenue
service
agent,
was
not
available
to
talk
to
until
yesterday
morning.
i
did
talk
to
him
yesterday
morning,
however,
mr.
mochel
advised
me
personally
on
the
telephone
that
the
version
of
the
facts
given
in
the
government's
brief
is
correct.
he
stated
unequivocally
that
he
had
turned
over
carbon
copies
of
these
reports
to
the
defense.
at
the
trial,
he
further
told
me
he
was
willing
to
testify
under
oath
and
he
further
told
me
that
he
is
willing
to
give
us
an
affidavit
to
that
effect.
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
not
clear
as
to
whether
he
turned
it
over
to
the
united
states
--
assistant
united
states
attorney
or
directly
to
defense
counsel.
but
he
is
unequivocal
in
his
statement
that
the
documents
were
turned
over
to
the
defense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
make
a
lot
of
--
his
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
not
--
he
stated
to
me
he's
not
sure
whether
he
--
but
he
is
sure
that
they
were
turned
over.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
defense
whether
--
in
other
words,
it
was
either
turned
over
directly
to
defense
counsel
or
to
the
united
states
--
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
in
turn
turned
it
over
to
the
defense
counsel.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
it's
assistant
united
states
attorney,
mr.
mcnally.
now,
mr.
mcnally
testi
--
told
me
that
his
recollection
was
hastened
but
that
he
does
definitely
recollect
that
typed
copies
of
reports
were
turned
over
to
the
defense
at
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
he
is
hasty
as
to
what
they
were.
he
said
his
recollections
as
he
thought
they
were
merely
typed
copies
of
the
preliminary
note.
i
think
it
maybe
helpful
if
i
explain
precisely
to
the
court
what
happened
with
respect
to
this,
what
these
documents
were.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
--
it
was
--
it
was
in
his
letter.
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mochel
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
indicated
he
would
be
willing
to
make
an
affidavit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
like
to
explain
to
the
court
precisely
what
these
documents
are
because
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
may
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
date
of
the
trial
was
in
may
19,
15
--
may
19,
1959.
this
was
around
may
11
to
may
12.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
less
than
two
years.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
what
happened
at
this
interview
involving
mr.
mochel
was
that
two
agents,
buescher
and
mochel
interviewed
first,
mr.
clancy
on
the13th
of
december
1956
and
then
mr.
kastner
and
mr.
prindable
the
following
day.
mr.
buescher
took
no
notes
but
mr.
mochel
did.
now,
the
notes,
which
i'm
going
to
refer
to
the
hand
--
of
the
handwritten
notes
of
this
rather
short
things
on
large
pieces
of
paper.
and
in
each
case,
on
each
day,
a
set
of
these
notes
was
made
with
respect
to
each
individual
defendant.
so
there
were
three
sets
of
handwritten
notes.
immediately
upon
returning
to
the
office
after
the
interviews,
the
agents
prepared
what
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
handwritten
report
which
was
they
wrote
out
in
hand.
on
the
basis
of
the
notes,
a
chronological
narrative
statement
of
what
was
said
at
the
interview.
and
following
that,
they
had
typed
up
verbatim
copies
of
this
handwritten
report
which
i
also
referred
to
as
the
final
typed
report
which
is
a
document
like
this.
now,
it
is
this
document,
the
typed
of
final
report
that
according
to
our
information
was
turned
over
to
the
defense
at
the
trial.
those
are
the
documents
which
we
have
reprinted
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
in
our
appendix.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
other
report?
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
well,
there
are
three
reports
relating
to
these
two
interviews
that
we
think
were
turned
over.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
they
were
not
turned
over,
no,
we
do
not
claim
it
is
harmless
error.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
correct.
but
we
think
that
on
the
basis
of
this
information
that
we
have
and
also
the
somewhat
cryptic
portions
of
the
transcript
describing
this
which
--
that
is
not
in
the
printed
record
before
this
case
but
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
21
to
23,
we've
set
forth
the
transcript
here,
at
least,
this
--
this
portion
is
certainly
not
inconsistent
with
the
position
we
have
taken.
on
one
occasion
as
a
reference
by
the
witness,
in
the
middle
of
page
22
of
the
memorandum,
then
there's
a
question
with
respect
to
a
statement
lowered
down.
so
we
think
that
in
the
circumstances,
if
in
--
as
we
believe
as
we
are
advised,
these
documents
have
been
turned
over,
we
think
this
is
a
clear
case
upon
was
error
and
we
say
that
they
--
this
court
should
not
decide
this
basic
question
in
this
state
of
the
record
but
should
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
a
hearing.
we're
asking
that
it
be
remanded
with
a
vacation
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
but
not
a
reversal
of
that
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
written
reports.
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
any
objection.
the
trial
court
himself
ruled
--
trial
court
judge
himself
rule
that
under
the
jencks
--
that
he
said
the
jencks
act
is
contemporaneously.
and
contemporaneously
said
doesn't
mean
something
that
you
made
later
on.
we
think
he
was
confused
between
the
first
subdivision
of
the
jencks
act
and
the
second
subdivision.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
as
far
as
i
know.
i
was
not
present
then.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
any
objections
by
the
united
states.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
at
page
21
to
23
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
not
in
the
printed
record,
it's
in
the
--
in
this
transcript
of
the
--
which
is
on
file
with
the
court
but
it's
not
in
the
printed
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
with
respect
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
earlier
--
there
is
--
we
refer
at
page
18
of
the
--
of
our
brief.
there's
an
early
ruling
by
the
trial
court
at
the
time
the
witness
minton
was
on
the
stand.
that's
the
indented
material
at
the
top
of
page
18.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
all
as
i
say
--
all
that
i
can
present
to
the
court
is
the
information
that
we
have
been
given.
i
think
these
are
questions
which
properly
should
be
canvassed
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mochel
is
the
agent,
yes.
he
was
one
of
those
who
participated
in
the
interview
with
the
defendant.
and
he
is
the
one
who
made
the
notes
and
then
who
made
the
handwritten
report
and
found
that
the
two
agents
made
the
typed
report
and
this
report
was
signed
by
both
pages.
now,
our
position
is,
with
respect
to
this,
as
far
as
the
witness
mochel
was
concerned
who
was
on
the
stand
at
the
time
we
believe
this
happened
that
there
was
clearly,
as
to
that
witness,
not
prejudicial
error.
and
it's
the
witness
buescher
who
had
not
made
the
notes
and
who
would
testify
and
had
let
the
stand.
we
think
that
in
that
situation
since
the
reports
show
that
they
were
signed
by
both
agents
that
it
--
in
no
circumstance,
it
was
still
not
prejudicial
error
because
the
man
could
have
been
recalled
for
further
cross-examination
on
the
basis
of
this
report
as
happened
with
respect
to,
at
least,
five
other
witnesses
during
the
course
of
this
trial.
now,
i
would
like
in
my
remaining
time
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
could
have
been
recalled,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
just
this.
we
think
that
on
this
record,
it's
unclear
what
happened.
all
that
we
are
saying
is
that
if,
in
fact,
the
facts
are,
as
we
understand
to
be,
then
that
would
be
not
prejudicial
error.
but
we
say
that
it
should
go
back
to
the
trial
court
to
determine
the
fact.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
if
these
documents
were
turned
over,
if
the
court
should
--
trial
court
so
find
that
then
any
error
was
not
prejudicial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
we
think
that
the
record
doesn't
affirmatively
show
that
they
were
turned
over.
the
record
also
doesn't
negatize
that
position.
we
think
that
this
is
a
case
where
the
record
may
not
fully
disclose
all
the
things
that
happened
at
the
trial
with
respect
to
what
particular
documents
were
or
were
not
produced.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
will
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
record,
as
it
exist,
is
consistent
would
argue
that
they
--
that
the
statements
that
they
were
turned
over.
there
is
nothing
affirmatively
that
says
"only
notes
turned
over".
and
as
i've
suggested
that
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
government
is
going
outside
of
the
record,
really,
to
bring
to
the
court
things
that
happened
outside
the
courtroom,
this
is
a
case
were
we
said
that
we
don't
think
the
record
fully
discloses
what
happened
at
the
court
from
circumstances
before
the
case
is
decided
it's
appropriate
for
the
record
to
be
supplemented
to
develop
fully
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
that
is
the
inevitable
result
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
what
we
--
what
we
attempted
to
do
was
to
indicate
to
this
court
in
our
brief
the
information
that
had
been
brought
to
our
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
suggest,
mr.
justice,
that
the
appropriate
steps
to
correct
the
record
is
to
have
the
fact
fully
developed
at
the
trial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
may
--
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
sure.
and
we
--
we
believe
that
--
and
we
presented
to
the
court
the
copies
of
these
interviews
and
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
for
one
thing,
mr.
justice,
we
were
--
didn't
know
until
last
thursday
that
this
was
to
be
challenged.
and
as
i
say
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
didn't
find
this
--
it
would
have
impossible
because
we
didn't
ascertain
this
information
until
yesterday.
now,
if
the
court
wants
we
would
be
very
glad
to
get
an
affidavit,
promise
to
mochel
which
he
has
told
me,
he
would
be
glad
to
furnish
and
--
and
oblige
that
with
the
clerk.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no,
no
mr.
justice,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
this
court
should
attempt
to
decide
these
controversies.
certainly,
this
court
cannot
resolve
this
conflicting
affidavit.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
matter
for
the
triers
of
the
trier
of
fact
for
the
district
court
to
determine
the
first
instance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
--
you
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
appropriate
thing
in
this
case
is
to
have
all
the
fact
fully
determined.
now,
when
the
case
goes
back,
we
will,
of
course,
attempt
to
develop
with
that.
but
on
the
basis
of
the
information
that
we
had
received,
we
think
we
were
warranted
in
presenting
these
facts
to
this
court.
now,
on
--
our
version
of
the
fact
has
been
challenged,
we
think
the
appropriate
proceeding
is
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
to
determine
all
of
this
fact.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
precisely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
argued
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
the
jencks
issue
was
raised
in
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
at
that
stage
of
the
case,
the
theory
of
the
united
states
attorney's
office
was
under
the
jencks
act.
the
production
of
the
notes
satisfied
the
act
and
that
the
defendants
had
no
right
to
receive
the
reports.
and
as
i
am
told
that
was
the
reason
why
they
attempted
and
did
not
inject
this
point
of
the
case
and
attempted
to
argue
it
on
--
on
that
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
all
that
i
can
say,
mr.
justice,
is
that
at
that
point,
this
was
theory.
there
was
some
--
that
point,
several
courts
of
appeals,
at
least
one
or
two,
had
held
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
know.
i
--
i
all
i
can
i
say
is
that
the
united
state
attorney
reported
to
--
to
us
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
in
september.
i
would
be
glad
to
try
to
ascertain
from
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
this
was
volunteered
by
him
after
--
after
he
had
sent
copies
of
letters
to
us
in
which
--
after
he
had
given
certain
information.

last
paragraph
of
his
letter

mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
we
--
this
letter
was
in
response
to
our
letter
of
the
september
20th
which
was
written
before
we
received
their
brief.
and
if
i
may
just
say
the
first
statement
made
by
the
united
states
attorney
which
raised
this
issue
said
that
portion
of
the
trial
transcript
pertaining
to
internal
revenue
agent
mochel's
testimony
as
related
in
your
letter,
we've
quoted
from
that
transcript,
does
not
appear
to
state
the
fact
clearly.
the
fact
is
that
mr.
mochel
upon
request
delivered
to
the
defense
attorney
a
typewritten
carbon
copy
of
his
secondary
notes.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
the
permission
to
make
a
brief
statement
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
suggestion
with
respect
to
further
investigation
of
this
notified
department
of
justice?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
will
make
an
investigation
and
we
will
advise
the
court
of
the
results
of
our
investigation
and
if
the
case
should
be
remanded
and
if
our
investigation
gives
us
reason
to
--
not
to
believe
that
the
documents
were
turned
over.
we'll
see
to
it
that
the
case
does
not
go
to
a
hearing
if
it
was
(inaudible)
to
remand
until
that
investigation
has
been
completed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
may
have
not
made
myself
clear,
mr.
chief.
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
government
will,
on
its
own,
undertake
to
do
this.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
it.
but
we
just
--
i
just
want
to
advise
the
court
in
line
with
mr.
justice
harlan's
suggestion
that
we
will
attempt
further
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
because
of
the
short
time
that
we
had
to
make
this
investigation
after
their
brief.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
clear
--
we
understand
clearly.
clearly.
we're
making
it
on
our
own.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
