are
you

saying

1957.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
have
just
referred
to
the
report
of
1956.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
pointing
to
the
particular
place
in
the
record
--
particular
part
of
the
search
warrant
which
you
say
is
repudiated
in
showing
to
be
false
by
this
proposal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
20
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
transcript.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
suppose
that
is
a
fact
that
statement
is
false
but
there
was
no
ground
for
it.
what
do
you
say
part
of
--
from
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
make
any
difference
of
the
argument
you're
now
making
why
you're
saying
that
this
was
a
false
statement
or
this
had
been
filed
and
it
has
no
reasonable
ground
with
effect
--
distinction
between
the
felony
and
misdemeanor
make
any
difference
in
the
argument
that
you
are
making
on
that
point?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
haven't
read
the
brief
but
would
you
mind
--
if
it
doesn't
disturb
you
any
way,
state
what
the
government's
difference
with
you
is
on
that
point
what
do
they
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
where
the
importance
of
the
--
comes
in
of
the
point
about
which
justice
harlan
made
inquiry
to
at
large?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
this
was
the
report
for
all
the
places
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
--
as
made
at
large?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
affidavit
to
which
you
refer
or
are
the
statements
about
having
made
this
report
the
one
that
appear
on
page
38,
number
4
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
page
38
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

on
form
11-c
which
was
been
filed
and
so
forth
and
at
eight
that
your
affidavit
defines
did
prepare
the
file
of
tax
return
to
each
of
the
warrants.
is
that
--
is
that
referring
to
this
report
and
for
registration
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
on
--
at
page
13
of
your
appendix.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
government
answer
your
motion
within
its
formal
pleading
or
did
it
answer
within
the
affidavit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
all
appears
then
and
there,
as
i
understand
what
you
said,
the
motion
to
suppress
and
your
affidavit
didn't
support
of
it
in
the
court's
judgment
passing
upon
it
here.is
that
the
only
record
that
we
have
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
charged
you
for
not
having
satisfied
that
requirements.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
is
that
also
a
false
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
any
regulation
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
address?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
address
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
under
the
home
address.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that?
that's
the
inference
you
draw
from
this,
i
suppose.
suppose
the
business
is
2401
ridge
avenue
and
the
home
address
of
clancy
is
2401
ridge
avenue,
home
address
of
the
others
is
in
different
place.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
number?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
anything
here
about
principle
place
of
business
in
this
report
or
in
the
census.
i
don't
know
what
materiality
that
you
have
but
i
don't
see
it.

justice
hugo
l.
black
for
that
questioning
what
you've
said
that
--
but
i
don't
know.
is
that
consistent
with
what
i
understood
you
to
say
that
if
they
had
searched
2401
under
such
ans
such
testimony,
would
that
have
been
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
though.suppose
they
had
gotten
it.
that
gets
back
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
been
asking.
suppose
they
have
gotten
it
with
reference
to
2401
for
the
plain
and
simple
case
(inaudible)
--
it
seems
to
be
at
first
here
that
they
gave
an
affidavit
that
there's
been
no
tax
to
the
judge.
there
has
been
no
taxes
paid
for
doing
business
at
2401
and
there
had
been,
what
would
say
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
let's
assume
that
what
he
said
have
to
--
this
man
had
no
place
of
business
except
2401.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
searched
it
on
an
affidavit
which
said
that
he
was
there
and
he
was
doing
business,
they
haven't
paid
the
tax
and
they
have
paid
the
tax
which
--
could
they
search
them
even
though
the
undisputed
evidence
showed
that
the
tax
was
paid
at
the
time
the
affidavit
was
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
that
--
yes,
there
is
an
affidavit.
yes,
there
is
a
registration
and
payment
of
tax,
isn't
it,
for
2401?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
payment
of
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
asking
is
just
this.
the
statement
was
that
--
the
affidavit
over
the
search
warrant
was
issued
was
that
they
were
guilty
of
not
doing
it,
not
paying.
suppose
that
there's
nothing
in
it
except
2401,
would
that
affidavit
support
this
search
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
warrant
merely
on
the
ground
that
the
judge
had
a
reasonable
ground
to
believe
it
because
they
told
them
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
is
one
because
of
the
statement
made
is
that
their
tax
had
not
been
paid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
--
that's
2300a.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
get
quite
get
--
i
had
rather
assume
that
the
law,
according
to
the
inquiry
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made,
if
you
judge
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
by
looking
at
it
to
see
if
it
was
reasonable
to
the
judge
with
a
reasonable
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
understood
you
to
say
later
that
if,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
before
that
there's
been
no
tax
paid,
they
do
business
at
the
same
place,
when
they
had,
is
that
search
warrant
wasn't
legal
--
a
search
warrant
issued
on
such
an
affidavit
wouldn't
be
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
there's
--
there's
an
oath
that
they
had
not
been
ready.
he
had
it
before,
he
issued
a
warrant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
been
registered
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
that
oath
was
not
true,
would
that
be
a
good
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
make
any
difference
where
they
operate
for
their
principle
place
of
business
or
just
operating
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
they
were
not,
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
--
what
did
he
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
the
united
states
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
it
was
not
turned
over,
does
the
government
say
that
was
harmless
error
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
both
--
all
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
were
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
ruling
of
the
judge?
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
it
not
in
the
record,
printed
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
all
that
took
place
according
to
this?
where
is
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
judges
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
asking
us,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
entire
stenographic
transcript
to
the
trial
failed
to
show
the
papers
were
delivered.
the
judge
had
said,
"they
couldn't
have
it.
we
should
send
it
back
for
a
trial
by
the
judge
alone,"
that
the
fact
predetermined
whether
or
not
a
seizing
of
the
record,
outside
of
the
record,
they
were
turned
over
to
the
counsel.
