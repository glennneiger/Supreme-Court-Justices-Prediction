mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
thomas
clancy,
james
prindable
and
donald
kastner
were
found
guilty
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois,
willfully
attempting
to
evade
and
defeat
a
tax
imposed
--
tax
in
violation
of
section
7201
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
tax
that
would
--
of
which
they
were
found
guilty
of
evading
was
the
10%
excise
tax
imposed
upon
wagers
received
by
persons
who
were
engaged
in
the
business
in
accepting
wagers
and
they
were
all
--
and
prindable
and
clancy
were
also
found
guilty
of
willfully
making
false
statements
to
internal
revenue
agents
in
violation
of
section
1001
of
title
26.
and
petitioner
kastner
was
found
not
guilty
of
that
charge.
and
all
three
were
found
guilty
of
conspiring
to
evade
all
of
the
substantive
charges
of
the
indictment.
now,
the
issues
before
this
court,
as
we
see
it,
are
whether
the
private
books
in
the
records
of
persons
who
are
engaged
in
the
wagering
business
may
be
seized
and
may
be
used
in
evidence
against
them
to
prove
their
guilt.
we
say
that
we
contend
that
this
is
a
violation
of
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
the
seizure
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
unreasonable
and
that
their
introduction
into
evidence
to
prove
their
guilt
constituted
a
violation
of
their
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
compelling
them
to
give
testimony
against
themselves.
the
second
point
is
whether
or
not
the
statements
prepared
by
internal
revenue
agents
relevant
to
the
subject
matter
of
their
testimony
are
required
to
be
produced
under
the
requirements
of
the
jencks
act
after
the
witnesses
--
after
the
agent
witnesses
have
so
--
have
testified.
a
new
issue
has
been
brought
into
the
case
since
it
is
before
this
court
that
is
in
regard
to
the
latter
question.
the
government
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
the
latter
question.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
government
in
their
brief
now
contends
that
we
received
signed
verbatim
carbon
copies
of
the
reports
of
the
internal
revenue
agents.
the
record,
of
course,
does
not
bare
this
out.
and
in
order
to
meet
this
injection,
this
new
issue
that
has
been
injected,
mr.
o'connell
and
--
and
myself
have
filed
--
have
lodged
our
affidavits
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
denying
that
we
ever
received
or
saw
these
statements
until
they
appeared
as
part
of
the
appendix
in
the
government's
brief.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
there
weren't
any
stenographic
notes,
sir.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
there
were
some
longhand
notes
of
mr.
mochel
that
were
produced
and
there
were
some
longhand
notes
of
agent
hudak.
these
notes
of
mr.
mochel
were
produced
and
they
were
examined
by
mr.
o'connell.

i've

i've
never

original

neither
of

there's
suppose
to
be
--
mr.
paul
p.

jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.

it
was
filed
few
days
ago.
mr.

i'm
not

mr.

mr.

no,

mr.

took
the
lead
in
the
trial
of
the

and
i
was
present
during
all
the
time.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well
--
well
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
there
would
be
still
another
statement
that
would
not
--
that
was
not
produced
and
that
was
the
statement
of
agent
minton.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
--
it
does
go
to
it
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
because
of
the
fact
that
that
is
the
second
point.
there
were
three
questions
presented
to
this
--
to
this
court
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
that
was
one
of
the
three
questions
present.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
they
said
we
received
signed
verbatim
carbon
copies
of
it
and
they're
tempting
to
inject
something
into
the
record
which
does
not
appear.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
sir,
because
there
would
still
be
another
one
because
there's
still
another
agent
involved,
agent
minton
whose
statement
we
demanded
and
it
was
refused.
so
consequently,
even
if
they
were
true,
there
is
still
another
point.
there
would
have
either
report
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
they
say
it
was
error
but
they
say
it
was
harmless
error
because
of
the
fact
that
agent
minton
was
present
at
the
time
the
search
took
place
and
there
was
agent
kienzler
was
also
present
and
actually,
they
executed
the
search
warrant
and
they
say
that
because
we
fail
to
also
ask
for
the
statement
of
agent
kienzler
that
it
was
harmless
error
for
--
for
the
court
below
to
refuse
to
--
to
order
the
production
of
agent
minton's
report.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.

mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
juergens,
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
we
deny
exactly
the
contention
made
by
the
government
that
we
received
signed
verbatim
carbon
copies
of
the
reports
of
the
agents.
they
specifically
alleged
this.
we
specifically
and
categorically
deny
it.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
never
saw
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
not
that
they
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not
get
verbatim
copies.
that's
our
contention.
we
did
not
receive
them.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
issue
we
have
made
here.
now
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
not
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
and
if
i
may
say
and
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
the
united
states
attorney
did
not
try
this
case
and
he
was
solemn
in
the
courtroom
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
tried
the
case
was
robert
mcnally.
we
included
his
name,
his
address
and
his
telephone
number
in
our
reply
brief
so
that
it
would
be
available
for
any
independent
investigation.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
we
filed
our
affidavit
sometime
last
week,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
some
time
last
week.
when
we
filed
our
reply
briefs,
they
were
filed
about
the
same
time
because
we
copied
the
affidavits
into
the
reply
briefs
and
they
were
sent
out
about
the
same
time
a
day
or
two
apart.
but
i
don't
know
exactly
what
day
they
were
received
or
some
day
last
week,
probably
thursday
--
wednesday
or
thursday
or
perhaps
friday
of
last
week.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
mcnally?
did
we
send
a
copy?
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
sent
them
not
only
--
we
sent
them
duplicate
original
affidavits
along
with
the
copies
of
our
reply
brief
in
which
they
were
printed
in
--
exactly.
now,
on
this
question
of
--
the
first
question
concerning
the
--
if
i
may
go
into
the
question
concerning
the
seizure
of
the
property.
the
property
is
contained
here
in
--
is
contained
physically
--
is
contained
in
the
courtroom
here
inconsistently
exhibits
which
are
located
in
this
box
which
we
have
here
below
the
desk.
and
the
exhibits
which
we
have
--
have
present
on
the
table
here.
and
the
search
about
which
we
complained
occurred
on
may
the
6th
of
1957.
for
approximately
four
years
prior
to
that
time,
the
petitioners
and
prindable
had
been
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers.
and
for
each
of
these
years,
in
which
they
were
so
engaged,
they
filed
their
application
for
registration
wagering
and
they
paid
the
$50
occupational
tax
due
thereon.
these
special
applications
and
registrations
were
actually
introduced
by
the
government
in
the
trial
of
this
case
and
are
physically
present
here
today.
for
these
years,
the
registration
was
not
only
filed
by
them
but
the
tax
was
also
paid.
we
have
in
our
reply
brief,
at
page
13,
had
a
photostatic
copy
of
the
last
registration
reproduced.
and
that
is
for
the
fiscal
year
commencing
on
july
the
1st
of
1956
and
concluding
on
june
the
30th
of
1957,
the
fiscal
year
during
which
this
rate
occurred.
and
if
i
may
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
this
part
of
our
appendix,
it
shows
that
the
registration
was
signed
by
thomas
d.
clancy
and
that
the
registration
included
the
names
of
donald
kastner,
one
of
the
petitioners
here,
james
prindable
and
thomas
clancy
doing
businesses
in
north
sales
company.
in
answer
to
question
two,
which
they
were
requested
to
give
their
business
address,
they
typed
in
the
words
"at
large
-
2401
ridge
avenue,
east
st.
louis,
illinois".
in
paragraph
5
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
your
honor,
that
was
crossed
out
subsequent
to
the
time
that
it
was
filed
by
the
petitioners.
the
accountant
who
prepared
this
in
behalf
of
the
petitioners
who
testified
at
the
trial,
he
identified
this
original
and
said
that
at
the
time
that
it
was
filed
by
him
that
this
was
not
crossed
out.
he
also
testified
that
it
was
never
returned
to
him
for
correction.
although
joseph
heckelbech,
chief
of
the
collection
district
in
the
springfield
district,
said
that
if
the
return
was
not
in
the
proper
form,
that
the
stamp
would
not
have
been
issued.
the
stamp
was
issued.
the
stamp
was
introduced
into
evidence
and
it
was
issued
in
the
name
of
all
three
and
it's
physically
present
here
in
this
court
as
exhibit
2
of
the
defense.
in
addition
to
that,
in
question
5a,
they
were
asked
to
list
each
location
in
which
they
did
business.
and
they
supplied
the
information
"at
large".
we
submit
that
that
was
the
manner
in
which
they
registered.
the
stamp
on
the
face
of
the
return,
special
tax
return
and
application
for
registry,
indicates
that
it
was
received
in
the
office
of
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
at
springfield,
illinois
on
june
the
29th
of
1956
along
with
the
remittance
which
was
a
$50
occupational
tax.
and
also,
if
i
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
search
warrant
was
actually
issued
on
--
to
search
for
and
seize
certain
property
located
at
a
particular
address
which
was
alleged
to
have
been
used
as
the
means
of
committing
two
crimes
of
failing
and
willfully
attempting
to
evade
and
--
the
fee
of
$50
occupational
tax
and
willfully
failing
to
prepare
and
file
an
application
for
registry-wagering
for
the
year
1956,
1957.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor
and
this
was
introduced
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
issued
to
seize
certain
property
in
a
--
at
a
designated
location.
it
was
issued
to
seize
property
located
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
well,
there
was
that
--
the
relation
to
this
respect,
we
say
that
there
was
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
--
some
of
the
internal
revenue
agents
because
they
stated
in
their
affidavits
to
the
issuing
judge
that
they
had
examined
the
application
of
james
prindable
and
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
that
he
gave
his
business
address
as
2401
ridge
avenue.
they
withheld
from
the
issuing
judge
the
fact
that
prindable
was
a
partner
of
the
north
sales
company
and
that
he
had
registered
under
at
large
application
and
that
he
had
also
listed
charles
kastner
as
an
employee
receiving
wagers
on
behalf
of
the
north
sales
company.
that
information
was
not
given
to
the
trial
judge
at
the
time
the
application
was
made
for
the
search
warrant.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
--
that
is
specifically
exempt.
i
think
--
i
believe
it's
section
4901
in
our
reply
brief.
here
it
is.
in
our
reply
brief,
4901,
title
26,
section
4901.
it
says
--
no,
excuse
me
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
4903.
490
--
title
26,
4903,
it's
on
page
17
of
our
reply
brief.
it
says,
"the
payment
of
the
special
tax
imposed,
other
than
the
tax
imposed
by
section
4411,
shall
not
exempt
from
an
additional
tax,
special
tax
the
person
carrying
on
a
trade
or
business
in
any
other
place
than
that
stated
in
the
register
kept
in
the
office
of
the
official."
consequently,
there
was
one
tax
paid
regardless
of
how
many
locations
they
have.
the
--
it
was
an
occupational
tax.
it
was
issued
on
persons
engaged
in
the
business
of
receiving
wagers.
and
as
in
this
case
where
there
were
three
persons
receiving
wagers
on
behalf
of
the
north
sales
company
and
as
partners,
all
three
of
them
paid
one
$50
occupational
tax.
and
they
were
--
that's
all
they
were
liable
for.
now,
each
person
accepting
wagers
in
their
behalf,
this
--
this
kastner,
this
employee
also
paid
an
additional
tax
and
i
believe
that
is
what
is
indicated
in
the
application
where
there
is
an
"okay”
alongside
his
name
where
they
were
required
to
list
the
name.
we
--
we
don't
know.
that
is
what
we
are
suspicious.
at
any
rate,
these
people
were
in
business.
for
four
--
about
four
years,
they
filed
these
applications
for
registration.
and
on
december
the
13th
of
1956,
during
the
same
fiscal
year,
their
--
their
books
were
--
they
--
an
interview
was
conducted
between
clancy
and
internal
revenue
agents
mochel
and
buescher.
and
at
that
time
he
told
them
that
the
north
sales
company
had
no
principal
place
of
business.
he
had
no
--
and
he
said
that
the
address
used
on
the
tax
return
was
his
residence
address,
2401
ridge
avenue.
no
objection
was
made
by
them.
they
get
--
anytime
tell
him
that
he
couldn't
do
business
in
that
manner
that
they
should
cease
and
desist
from
that
practice.
but
they
--
they
gave
them
--
they
issued
the
stamp
pursuant
to
this
same
type
of
application,
these
at
large
registrations.
on
the
following
day,
these
same
agents
interviewed
the
other
two
partners.
now,
subse
--
they
--
these
--
these
two
interviews
took
place
after
the
books
of
the
partnership
were
audited.
and
after
he's
took,
they
interviewed
them,
they
audited
the
books
in
connection
with
the
payment
of
the
10%
wagering
tax
and
then
they
conducted
these
interviews
in
connection
with
this
registration.
they
asked
him
where
they
--
how
they
operated
and
so
forth.
now,
subsequent
to
this
audit
and
subsequent
to
these
interviews,
the
petitioners
received
a
letter
from
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
at
springfield,
illinois
informing
them
that
as
a
result
of
the
recent
examination
that
their
returns
would
be
accepted
as
final
and
that
covered
the
period
january
of
1955
to
december
of
1956.
then
apparently
in
somewhere
around
march
the
20th,
we
don't
know
the
exact
date,
but
from
the
affidavits
of
the
search
warrant,
they
were
to
conclude
that
somewhere
in
march
of
1957,
just
a
several
months
after
this
interview,
these
internal
revenue
agents
began
watching
premises
known
as
2300
state
street.
now,
this
was
a
four-unit
building.
we
are
concerned
with
the
westerly
one-half
which
consisted
of
a
tavern
on
the
first
floor
and
an
apartment
upstairs.
now,
in
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrants,
the
agent
johnson
made
the
principle
affidavit
in
which
he
incorporated
by
reference
affidavits
of
seven
other
internal
revenue
agents.
and
they
concerned
themselves
principally
without
going
into
a
great
deal
of
detail,
principally
with
activities
concerning
the
acceptance
and
the
placing
of
wagers
on
the
first
floor
premises.
now,
somewhere
around
the
12th
of
april,
one
of
the
internal
revenue
agents
saw
jim
or
kim,
apparently
the
reference
is
to
prindable,
entered
the
side
door
of
the
tavern,
go
behind
the
bar
and
then
go
through
a
door
that
led
upstairs.
this
was
on
the
12th
of
april
of
1957
and
he
said
that
the
man
at
that
time
was
carrying
a
bag,
similar
to
the
bags
furnished
by
banks
to
carry
money.
then
the
next
connection
that
we
have
would
be
upstairs
second
floor
premises,
concerns
the
fact
that
on
may
the
1st
there
were
numerous
agents
but
--
internal
revenue
agents
both
inside
and
outside
this
tavern
and
at
about
nine
minutes
after
seven
or
five,
if
i
remember
correctly,
charles
kastner,
the
man
who
was
listed
on
this
return
as
being
an
employee
of
the
north
sales
company
arrived
and
went
into
the
side
door
of
the
tavern.
now,
a
few
minutes
later,
internal
revenue
agents
found
him,
followed
him
in.
there's
nothing
contained
in
the
affidavit
as
to
where
he
went
and
what
happened
to
kastner.
but
about
eight
or
nine
minutes
later,
james
prindable,
the
partner
of
the
north
sales
company
came
and
entered
the
same
door.
and
by
that
time,
there
was
an
agent,
an
internal
revenue
agent
inside
that
he
saw
him
go
behind
the
bar
and
he
saw
him
go
through
this
door
in
the
northeast
corner
that
led
upstairs.
that
was
principally
upon
the
information,
the
connection
of
--
of
these
two
people
whom
the
internal
revenue
agents
alleged
in
their
affidavits
to
be
well-known
book
makers
and
whose
registrations,
they
say
they
examined
the
following
day
on
may
the
2nd
of
1957
that
they
applied
for
a
search
warrant
for
the
second
floor.
there
were
two
search
warrants
applied
for
by
agent
johnson,
one
for
the
first
floor,
for
the
tavern
and
a
second
one
for
the
second
floor
premises,
the
apartment.
the
search
warrant
was
issued
and
i
say
to
you
and
we
say
that
that
thing
was
shown
by
the
internal
revenue
agents
because
the
--
the
full
and
complete
facts
were
not
presented
to
the
issuing
judge,
the
fact
that
this
at
large
application
have
been
filed
by
prindable
and
the
fact
that
kastner
had
been
listed
on
the
return
as
an
employee
accepting
wagers
on
behalf
of
the
partnership.
if
that
fact
have
been
--
have
been
given
to
the
court
and
the
court
acting
as
a
reasonably
prudent
man,
but
it
come
to
the
conclusion
only
that
this
was
one
of
the
places
or
this
was
a
place
at
which
the
north
sales
company
was
accepting
wagers
on
those
particular
days.
with
that
information,
the
judge
was
not
given
the
benefit
of
that
information
before
the
warrant
was
issued.
and
we
say
that
if
they
had
known
this
fact,
the
only
possibility
would
be
--
even
if
--
well,
i
think
mr.
o'connell
--
excuse
me,
i
won't
go
into
that,
mr.
o'connell,
i
believe,
would
cover
that
point
in
his
portion
of
the
argument.
but
then
this
--
the
search
warrant
was
issued
to
any
special
agent,
special
agent
george
kienzler
then
took
the
search
warrant.
he
went
to
2300a
state
street
to
the
apartment.
when
he
arrived
at
the
apartment
armed
with
a
search
warrant,
he
was
confronted
by
donald
kastner,
one
of
the
partners
of
the
north
sales
company.
and
he
asked
kastner
what
he
was
doing
here
and
kastner
said
he
was
waiting
for
one
or
more
telephone
calls
and
that
it
was
north
sales
company.
and
he
asked
him
if
he
had
a
stamp
and
he
said,
"well,
the
north
sales
company
has
a
stamp
but
i
don't
have
it
but
tom
takes
of
it,"
in
reference
to
tom
clancy
and
--
and
of
course,
for
a
partnership,
if
there
are
more
than
one
name,
there
are
more
--
the
stamp
is
issued
to
a
partnership,
all
names
were
placed
on
a
one
stamp
and
consequently,
there
is
only
one
stamp
and
each
partner
does
not
get
an
individual
stamp
nor
he
doesn't
pay
any
individual
tax.
so,
conceivably,
all
three
partners
couldn't
have
the
same
stamp
at
the
same
time.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
your
honor,
it
was
an
apartment.
it
was
an
apartment
in
which
henry
zittel,
sr.
resided.
it's
a
five-room
apartment.
and
these
people
operated
and
the
record
shows
quite
clearly
that
they
operated
at
many
places.
many
places
and
they
went
from
place
to
place.
i
--
i
think
it
is
quite
obvious
that
if
an
individual
engage
in
a
wagering
business
complies
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
wagering
act
and
he
indicates
a
place
in
which
he
is
going
to
do
business,
he
will
be
very
properly
met
by
the
local
authorities.
consequently,
these
people
filed
at
large
applications
and
by
the
testimony
of
the
govern
--
of
two
of
the
government's
witnesses,
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
conducting
business
in
this
manner.
they
paid
the
tax.
they
registered
and
these
people
also,
if
i
might
add,
filed
monthly
reports
of
the
amount
of
wagers
received
and
they
paid
a
10%
tax
on
the
amount
of
--
of
wager
so
reported.
these
returns
for
the
fiscal
year
1956
and
1957
were
introduced
into
evidence
and
the
trial
of
this
case
by
the
government
and
are
physically
present
here
in
--
in
the
court.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
they
claimed
that
the
one
for
the
month
of
march
was
incorrect,
your
honor.
we
had
some
disagreement
about
that
because
on
our
theory
of
the
case,
the
original
acceptor
of
the
debt
is
liable
for
the
tax
and
if
he
lays
off
a
portion
of
this
to
someone
else,
he,
nonetheless,
is
responsible
for
the
payment
of
the
complete
tax
unless
he
meets
certain
requirements
which
none
of
these
people
did.
and
in
our
opinion,
dim
as
now,
these
were
layoffs
and
the
initial
acceptor
was
responsible
for
the
payment
of
the
tax.
so
then,
if
i
might
say,
this
search
warrant
was
then
issued
and
it
was
authorized
the
seizure
of
the
books,
records,
memoranda,
tickets,
pads,
tablets
and
papers
recording
receipts
of
money
and
so
forth
and
all
of
which
are
designed
or
intended
to
use
and
which
have
been
used
in
the
conduct
of
a
wagering
business,
have
been
used
in
carrying
on
some
wagering
business.
"and
as
a
means
of
committing
divers
criminal
offences,"
and
i'm
reading
now
from
the
search
warrant,
first,
--
not
as
first,
it's
not
in
here,
"of
willfully
attempting
to
evade
and
defeat
a
tax
imposed
by
the
internal
revenue
laws
of
the
united
states
and
the
payment
thereof,
to
wit,
the
special
tax
of
$50
a
year
to
be
paid
by
each
person
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
and
willfully
failing
to
prepare
and
file
with
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
at
springfield,
illinois
the
special
tax
return
and
application
for
registry-wagering
(form
11-c)".
we
submit
that
exhibits
--
the
exhibit
contained
on
page
12
of
our
appendix
which
was
also
exhibit
14
and
the
trial
of
this
cause
indicates,
that's
a
special
form
11-c,
this
indicates
in
itself
that
neither
of
these
two
crimes
alleged
in
the
search
warrant
had
in
fact
nor
could
possibly
have
been
committed
by
the
petitioners
or
the
partners.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
sir,
it's
on
page
13
of
our
reply
brief.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
that
--
the
search
warrant
charges
a
failure
to
file
this
and
the
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
the
return
indicates
it
was
received
in
the
office
of
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
and
was
accompanied
by
the
remittance.
it
indicates
that
neither
of
these
crimes
were
in
fact
committed.
now
then,
this
agent,
agent
kienzler
went
to
these
premises.
and
although
he
must
have
been
satisfied
with
the
explanation
by
kastner
that
this
was
the
operation
of
north
sales
company
because
no
arrest
were
made.
consequently,
any
seizure
of
property
here
must
be
authorized
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
search
warrant
and
cannot
be
authorized
as
incidental
to
any
arrest
because
no
arrest
was
actually
made
on
the
premises.
it
was
a
five-room
apartment.
george
kienzler
had
the
search
warrant,
he
executed
it.
he
was
accompanied
by
agent
minton
and
apart
to
kienzler's
own
testimony
by
two
or
three
other
agents,
internal
revenue
agents.
nonetheless,
they
spent
three
hours
searching
this
place.
as
a
result,
they
seized
the
private
books
and
records
of
these
petitioners.
for
march
and
april
and
the
first
four
days
of
may
recording
the
receipts,
recording
the
bets
by
the
individual
days
showing
the
amount
that
was
placed
by
a
person
making
direct
bets
and
in
our
opinion,
persons
also
making
layoff
bets.
mr.
paul
p.

jr.
1957,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
that's
for
fiscal
year
commencing
july
the
1st
of
1956
and
concluding
on
june
the
30th
of
1957.
that's
fiscal
year,
your
honor.
but
this
was
--
this
record
--
this
record
was
during
that
fiscal
year
that
they
were
in
march
and
april
and
the
first
four
days
of
may.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i'd
be
very
happy
to.
the
crime
is
alleged
in
the
search
warrant
on
page
20,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
of
our
transcript
to
my
record.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
page
20.
alleges
the
--
that
certain
property
was
used
to
commit
two
crimes.
the
crimes
alleged
to
have
been
committed
are
shown
on
page
20
down
about
two
thirds
of
the
page,
your
honor,
of
willfully
attempting
to
evade
and
defeat
a
tax
imposed
by
the
internal
revenue
laws
of
united
states
and
the
payment
thereof
to
wit
the
special
tax
of
$50
a
year.
that's
the
first
crime
alleged.
the
face
of
this
return
itself
shows
that
the
special
tax
return
and
application
for
registry
wagering
for
the
fiscal
year,
this
is
on
page
13,
your
honor,
of
our
reply
brief.
it
was
filed
for
the
fiscal
year
july
the
1st
of
1956
to
june
the
30th
of
1957
and
the
stab
of
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
shows
that
it
was
received
in
his
office
on
june
the
29th
of
1956
along
with
the
remittance.
and
the
remittance
in
that
situation
would
be
the
$50
tax.
this
$50
is
actually
written
above
the
line
in
the
upper
right
hand
corner.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
sir?
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
they
were
not
indicted.
they
were
indicted
for
neither
offense.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
that
--
that
appeared
in
the
search
warrant.
now
--
now,
mr.
justice
black,
the
second
crime
alleged
in
the
search
warrant
is
a
few
lines
below
that
on
--
still
on
page
20
and
it
is
the
fourth
last
line
from
the
bottom
says,
"of
willfully
failing
to
prepare
and
file
with
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
at
springfield,
illinois,
a
special
tax
return
and
application
for
registry-wagering
(form
11-c).”
that
is
this
return,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
we
say,
your
honor,
that
at
the
time
--
that
number
one,
we
say
that
if
the
full
information
had
been
given
to
the
issuing
judge
and
he's
acting
as
a
reasonably
good
man,
the
warrant
would
have
been
issued
because
of
the
fact
that
the
warrant,
a
search
warrant
would
issue
for
the
instrumentalities
of
committing
a
misdemeanor
and
a
(inaudible)
failing
to
register
would
be
a
misdemeanor.
there
are
some
questions
to
my
mind
as
to
whether
this
willful
figure
to
pay
is
not
a
misdemeanor.
i
think
it
would
be
but
they
have
alleged
it
in
the
search
warrant
as
a
--
as
a
felony.
the
willful
attempt
to
pay
the
usual
prosecution
under
the
other
case
that
we
say
in
this
regard
were
on
information
filed
against
persons
who
neither
pay
the
$50
tax
or
who
filed
their
application.
that
is
the
usual
type
prosecution.
but
here,
they
alleged
a
different
crime.
they
alleged
the
willful
attempt
to
evade.
they
alleged
a
felony
but
i
don't
see
any
over
in
act
which
--
which
they
could
prove
it
on
but
nonetheless,
that's
what
they
alleged
in
the
search
warrant.
and
i
say
that
neither
the
petitioners
were
indicted
for
neither
of
these
crimes.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
perhaps,
i
might
be
confusing
a
little
bit,
your
honor.
what
we
say
here,
your
honor,
is
that
there,
in
fact,
no
crime
had
been
committed.
this
crimes
alleged
in
the
search
warrant
haven't
been
committed.
and
since
the
search
warrant
authorizes
the
seizure
of
instrumentalities
of
these
crimes
that
the
search
warrant
wouldn't
have
been
issued
because
these
crimes,
in
fact,
have
not
been
permitted
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
and
therefore,
since
the
crime
had
been
committed
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
they
say
that
the
--
that
because
of
the
fact
that
they
say
number
--
number
--
they
say
this.
that
a
person
engaged
in
the
wagering
business
must
file
information
in
each
place
in
which
he
does
business.
they
said
that
is
required.
and
consequently,
since
they
didn't
furnish
information
as
to
each
place
which
they
did
business
that
therefore,
the
agents
have
reasonable
grounds
to
believe
that
this
was
not
then
operating
at
this
particular
occasion
with
somebody
else.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
say
that
our
people
were
authorized
to
operate
at
large
which
meant
they
could
operate
to
any
place.
the
government
says
that
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
sir
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
see,
there
would
only
be
one
application
that
would
be
filed.
we
say
in
that
regard
that
you
require
--
if
there
are
two
conditions
under
which
a
supplemental
registration
is
required,
one,
if
you
add
new
agent
and
the
other
one
is
if
you
move
your
principal
place
of
business.
we
say
our
people
did
not
move
their
principal
place
of
business.
consequently,
they
were
not
required
to
file
any
supplemental
registration.
also,
as
we've
cited
in
the
brief,
even
if
they
had
taken
the
government's
argument
as
true
which
we
deny,
even
if
they
have,
they
have
30
days
to
register.
they
have
30
days
to
file
a
supplemental
application
or
registration
and
30
days
haven't
expired
between
the
time
that
the
--
their
first
connection
with
the
premises
on
april
the
12th
and
the
time
of
the
raid
on
may
the
6th.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
there
--
the
basis
for
the
affidavit
of
the
search
warrant
are
contained
in
the
record.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
after
the
indictment.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
set
--
we
file
a
motion
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
and
return
the
property.
and
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
in
substance,
we
did
that
because
we
file
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
we
filed
a
motion
for
the
return
of
the
property.
it's
on
page
36
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
--
and
with
that,
we
say
that
the
warrant
issued
was
insufficient
on
its
face
of
the
property
and
the
seize
was
not
described
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
that
the
warrant
was
illegally
executed
and
that
the
property
wasn't
subject
to
seizure.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
what
we
did,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
we
filed
an
affidavit
in
support
of
that
and
in
support
of
the
affidavit
for
the
search
warrant
for
the
motion
to
suppress.
we
filed
this
affidavit
signed
by
the
partners
stating
that
they
had
registered,
that
they
had
paid
the
tax
and
so
forth.
and
we
have
the
--
we
introduced
to
evidence,
exhibits
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
there
was
no
information
offered
in
--
to
--
to
controvert
these
facts
by
the
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
entered
a
stipulation
that
information
taken
from
this
record
was
presented
to
a
grand
jury
which
indicted
these
people.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
we
filed
an
affidavit
saying
that
these
people
had
registered,
they
paid
the
tax
and
they
operated
under
an
at
large
application.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
it
was
not
contested
by
the
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
they
never
filed
and
they
never
offered
any
evidence
whatsoever
nor
did
they
ever
attempt
to
controvert
those
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
the
ruling
is
by
the
trial
judge
and
the
trial
judge
finds
that
this
property
could
be
seized
because
it's
an
instrumentality
for
the
commission
of
some
other
crime
not
alleged
in
the
search
warrant.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
on
page
52,
your
honor,
page
52
of
the
record.
judge
says
that
the
court
finds
that
the
item
seized
under
the
authority
of
search
warrant
were
used
and
attempted
to
be
used
as
a
means
of
carrying
on
the
attempt
to
defeat
and
evade
the
excise
tax.
now,
that's
--
the
excise
tax
is
a
10%
tax
imposed
on
wagers,
which
was
not
alleged
in
the
search
warrant.
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
real
ruling
of
the
trial
court
that
these
were
instrumentalities
for
the
commission
of
a
crime
of
attempting
to
evade
the
10%
wagering
tax.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
that
affidavit,
mr.
justice
black,
is
--
commences
on
37
and
concludes
on
page
40
and
i
didn't
understand
--
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
four,
your
honor,
refers
to
this
registration
here.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reference
to
eight,
the
monthly
--
the
monthly
returns
are
these
returns
that
were
filed
by
the
month.
that
shows
how
--
how
about
the
wagers
were
--
how
much
was
accepted
and
what
the
taxes
were.
and
they're
introduced
here
in
a
--
they
were
introduced
in
evidence
by
the
government.
and
on
page
37,
we
say
that
--
in
this
affidavit
that
according
in
--
at
a
approx
--
on
--
that
accordingly
on
approximately
june
29th,
1956,
they
did
prepare
to
file
the
said
form
referring
to
--
preceding
paragraph,
form
11-c.
i'm
referring
to
--
again
to
this.
and
they
did
pay
the
tax
due
thereon
if
they
were
issued
to
stand.
these
allegations
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
they
did
,not
your
honor.
they
did
not,
your
honor.
they
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
filed
a
brief
in
opposition
to
our
motion.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
there
was
also
a
stipulation.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
that
stipulation
is
--
begins
on
page
41,
mr.
justice
black,
and
it's
the
stipulation
which
we
entered
with
the
united
states
attorney
in
which
he
said
that
the
information
taken
from
these
books
and
records
which
were
seized
were
presented
to
a
grand
jury
then
sitting
in
the
eastern
district
of
illinois
which
returned
the
indictments
against
these
defendants,
showing
directly
that
the
information
that
has
been
taken
from
these
records
were
presented
to
a
grand
jury
which
returned
the
indictments.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
4412,
that
is
the
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
21.
let's
see.
oh,
your
honor,
4412
requires
the
persons
who
are
engaged
in
the
business
of
accepting
wagers
are
required
to
--
to
register.
they
are
required
to
register
and
there
are
certain
requirements
they're
supposed
to
put
their
name
and
address.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
that
is
not
true.
they
say
the
--
the
words,
your
honor,
they
said
that
they
willfully
failed
to
prepare
and
file
with
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
at
springfield,
illinois
the
special
tax
return
and
application
for
registry-wagering.
there
it
is.
they
say
that
we
--
our
people
failed
to
file
this
warrant,
which,
in
fact,
had
been
filed.
now
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
in
this
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
only
allegations
were
made,
your
honor,
in
the
affidavit
but
as
far
as
the
motion
to
suppress
is
concerned,
we
alleged
all
of
the
grounds
listed
under
the
--
under
rule
41.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question
either.
all
i
can
say
--
i
would
say
--
i
would
think
yes
because
i
think
this
that
we
--
we
felt
at
the
time
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
rule
41
(e)
provides
for
a
hearing
on
a
motion
to
suppress
and
i
think
that
the
court's
required
to
receive
evidence
in
support
of
any
allegations
that
are
made
at
that
time.
i
--
and
we
felt
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
us
to
furnish
proof
of
it.
now,
when
we
file
the
affidavit
alleging
the
facts
and
it
was
uncontroverted,
we
didn't
feel
it
was
necessary
at
that
point
to
attempt
to
introduce
any
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
all
i
can
say,
your
honor,
is
that
we
felt
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
us
to
file
an
affidavit
in
support
of
our
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
--
grounds.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
my
associate
tells
me
that
the
point
that
you're
--
you're
making,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
i
should
respond
to
that
that
they
were
in
charge
with
the
offense
in
the
indictment.
they
--
the
search
warrant
--
the
charges
in
the
search
warrant
were
not
the
same
charges
upon
which
they
were
indicted.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
say
this,
your
honor,
if
i
understand
and
that
we
understand
that
the
case
is
in
regard
to
search
and
seizure,
historically,
the
purpose
for
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant
is
to
authorize
an
officer
upon
furnishing
proof
of
probable
cause
that
a
crime
is
being
committed
before
a
magistrate
to
obtain
the
warrant
to
go
out
and
to
seize
the
property
to
prevent
the
future
commission
of
the
crime.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
we
--
we
submit
that
this
provision
of
rule
41
(e)
gives
the
court
a
second
look
at
the
question
of
probable
cause
that
there
might
be
certain
facts
presented
to
the
court
when
--
when
receiving
that
information,
i
think
there
is
a
probable
cause
but
that
is
--
that's
an
ex
parte
hearing
and
we
certainly
don't
think
that
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
can
be
determined
in
an
ex
parte
hearing.
we
submit
that
rule
41
(e)
gives
the
persons
aggrieved,
the
persons
withstanding
the
complaint,
the
right
to
come
in
to
file
their
motion
to
suppress
and
for
the
return
of
the
property
and
that
--
and
at
that
time
to
introduce
evidence
to
prove
that
there
were
no
grounds
for
the
seizure
of
their
property
or
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights.
we
think
that
--
we
--
we
felt
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
us
to
--
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
yes,
yes.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
for
the
issuance,
your
honor.
if
i
--
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
the
time
for
mr.
o'connell
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
p.
waller,
jr.
