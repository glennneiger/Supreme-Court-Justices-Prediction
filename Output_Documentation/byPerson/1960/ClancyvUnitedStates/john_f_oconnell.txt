mr.
john
f.
o'connell
(inaudible)
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
not
to
mention,
justice,
as
i
will
explain,
we
are
making
this
on
the
basis
of
what
was
told
to
us
by
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
no.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
from
the
time
i
was
in
the
law
school,
my
aspiration
was
to
talk
before
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
i
never
thought
i
had
to
be
talking
in
front
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
say
that
i'll
take
an
affidavit
that
i
am
not
a
lawyer.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
and
i
am
not
--
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
that's
the
only
--
that's
where
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
use
the
wrong
language
but
i
noticed
that
chief
justice
warren
had
to
ask
me
please
not
two
attorneys
at
the
same.
and
that's
--
actually
this
--
this
--
he
has
excited
me
and
upset
me
more
than
--
than
the
whole
case
itself.
we
did
not
receive
anything
but
longhand
notes
from
the
government
and
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
mcnally
would
--
for
whom
i
have
the
greatest
respect
in
the
world,
i
call
him
on
the
phone
and
i
said,
"mr.
mcnally,
give
me
the
facts
now.
here's
what
the
solicitor
general
said
and
he
says
he
gets
this
from
ramer,
ramer
wasn't
even
in
the
courtroom."
and
he
said,
"you
received
the
longhand
notes."
now,
mr.
mcnally
can
really
be
telling
completely
the
truth
when
he
has
said
he
has
a
vague
memory
of
some
typewritten
reports.
the
typewritten
reports
came
from
mr.
hudak
who
do
we
--
we
do
not
deny
would
receive
those
--
that
report.
i
thought
it
was
his
regular
investigator
report
but
mr.
mcnally
said,
"no,
that
was
his
longhand
notes
typed
up
and
signed
by
him,
so
you
didn't
receive
his
investigative
report
that
you
demanded."
we
received
mr.
hudak,
he
is
the
chief
of
the
internal
revenue
service
in
east
st.
louis,
and
we
received
henry
zittel,
he
had
a
typewritten
report
signed
by
him.
those
are
two
reports
we
received
pursuant
to
the
jencks
act.
the
others,
we
did
not
receive.
mr.
minton's
--
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
oh,
it
was
the
hottest
--
hottest
day
of
may
and
i
think
it
took
us
four
days.
it
was
--
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
13th,
14th
--
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
11th,
12th,
13th
and
14th
of
1959.
there's
one
question
i
would
like
--
one
more
thing
on
this
statement,
then
i'd
like
to
drop
it
because
i
think
that
probably
the
integrity
of
the
attorney
is
just
not
quite
as
important
as
the
constitutional
rights
of
our
client.
but
let
me
say,
since
we've
been
permitted
to
go
completely
outside
the
record
that
when
i
got
the
government's
brief,
i
was
a
lot
more
indignant
than
i
appear
to
be
here
now
and
i
call
cliff
ramer
who
is
the
united
states
attorney.
and
i
said,
"cliff,
you
know
it
isn't
so."
at
first
he
said,
"well,
john,
he
says
that,
"i
think
it's
--
i
think
it's
so."
and
i
said,
“cliff,
you
know
it
isn't
so.
you
weren't
even
in
the
courtroom.”
and
he
said,
"well,
i
call
all
the
agents
together
and
they
said
it
was
so,"
and
i
said,
"cliff,
i'm
going
to
be
before
the
supreme
court.
i'll
make
an
affidavit
in
front
of
you.
you'd
better
be
here."
and
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
there's
no
affidavit
and
there's
no
cliff.
that's
all
i
have
to
say
about
it.
as
judge
frankfurter
says,
there
could
be
certain
things
that
may
not
necessarily
be
that
you're
lying
but
sure,
he's
got
to
be
upset.
anyhow,
i
think
that
the
point
that
the
government
makes
about
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
--
petitioners
were
not
involved
since
this
was
addressed
to
a
specific
place,
with
specific
property
can
--
is
answered
because
in
the
ford
case
a
long,
long
time
ago,
probably
the
landmark
case,
that
same
objection
was
made.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
how
well
i
remembered
it,
but
i've
got
it
written
down
as
--
best,
i
remember
it.
property
as
a
property
cannot
offend
forfeit.
and
i
remember
this
word,
"unlade,
evade
taxes
or
the
like
but
only
men
whose
goods
they
are."
and
i
think
that's
a
sufficient
answer
to
the
government's
contention
because
it
wasn't
addressed
to
north
sales
company.
they
were
not
involved.
there
had
no
cause
to
complain.
the
property
was
theirs.
mr.
friedman
has
given
his
definition
of
what
at
large
means
to
him.
once
again,
i
thought
we
were
confined
with
the
record.
i'm
going
to
adopt
the
definition
of
the
government's
witness
in
--
in
the
record,
which
says,
“at
large
means,
you
can
do
business
anywhere."
and
these
men
weren't
doing
business
anywhere.
if
you
look
throughout
the
record,
i
can
name
plymouth,
benton,
vermont,
cucarola,
arrow
all
these
different
places.
that's
where
they
were
doing
business.
in
addition,
there
were
telephones
that
they
had
at
lampi's,
manning's,
burns,
they
use
those
telephones.
there
wasn't
one
--
one
proof
that
of
depth
was
ever
taken
at
2300a
state
street
in
the
record
or
in
the
warrant.
and
that's
the
business
that
they're
talking
about,
the
business
of
accepting
wagers.
an
old
man's
apartment
is
actually
what
it
was,
an
old
man's
apartment
and
these
fellows
were
there
and
they
had
their
records
there.
there
is
--
heckelbech
says
there's
nothing
wrong
with
doing
business
at
large.
and
he
is
the
man
that
we're
supposed
to
know.
and
he
says,
"if
there
was
--
if
the
--
the
application
was
wrong,
we
would
have
sent
it
back."
but
the
government
by
stipulation
says
that
we
--
the
stamp
was
issued
on
this
application.
and
in
our
--
and
the
government's
accountants
--
witness
who
was
also
the
accountant
of
the
petitioners
stated
that
the
application
was
never
sent
back.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
page
13
of
our
appendix,
you
can
see
that
there's
enough
time
in
there
for
an
application
to
have
been
sent
back
if
any
corrections
have
been
made.
and
there's
--
the
same
exhibits
since
1953,
these
"at
large"
being
crossed
out.
and
i
--
at
the
--
at
large
--
the
government
is
tracking
itself
by
the
regulations
and
everything
else,
but
now
they're
operating
at
large
--
they
permitted
them
to
operate
at
large
for
about
four
years
and
all
of
a
sudden,
they
determined
that
they
wanted
--
considered
this
an
offense.
they
say
that
--
that
there
is
--
it's
an
illegal
to
do
business
without
registry.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute,
the
statute
that
says
it's
illegal
to
--
to
do
business
without
registering.
the
statute
says
it
is
a
condition
precedent
to
do
--
do
business,
you
must
pay
the
tax.
and
that's
all
the
statute
says.
and
this
court
said
i
think
in
(inaudible),
“you
can't
feed
a
statute
by
regulation."
and
that's
what
they've
attempted
to
do
by
the
regulation.
justice
frankfurter,
you
said
you
asked
mr.
waller
a
question
and
you
said,
“well,
you
can't
prove
the
substantive
offense
in
the
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
but
this
is
one
of
the
peculiar
cases
which
occurred.
there's
no
other
case
that
i
could
think
and
i
looked,
and
looked
and
looked.
you
can't
find
another
case
in
the
books
where
you
can
go
in
on
a
search
warrant
and
show
the
judge,
this
crime
has
not
been
committed.
most
of
them,
it's
the
same
crime
in
the
indictment.
they
couldn't
file
this
crime
--
put
this
crime
in
an
indictment
because
they
knew
it
wasn't
committed.
but
we've
proved
to
the
judge
that
the
crime
wasn't
committed.
and
he
whistled
himself
out
of
it
by
saying,
“well,
it's
--
it's
the
instrumentalities
for
the
offense
of
--
of
violating
the
10%
wagering
tax.”
and
it
couldn't
be
the
instrumentality,
i
mean
if
we're
going
to
argue
instrumentality,
it's
my
position
that
these
were
the
private
books
and
records
and
they're
--
they're
sacred.
and
you
can't
violate
the
fifth
amendment
by
just
changing
name
and
saying
they're
instrumentalities.
but
even
if
there
were
instrumentalities,
what
is
an
instrumentality?
the
government
has
been
playing
on
words
in
saying,
“it
is
an
instrumentality
and
defining
it
by
repeating
the
word.
an
instrumentality
means
the
means
by
which
an
offense
has
been
committed."
what
is
the
offense
of
--
of
falsely
filing?
when
you
filed
that
form
730
and
it's
wrong,
certainly
that's
the
instrumentality.
the
offense
has
been
committed
and
all
of
these
other
stuff
is
evidence.
and
the
government
used
this
as
evidence
of
private
books
and
record.
and
to
me,
you
can't
change
the
constitution
by
--
by
words
that
--
or
misconstruing
words
and
that's
what
the
government
attempted
to
do.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
certainly.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
--
(voice
overlap)
--
the
same
provision
to
keep
in
record
applies
to
the
grocery,
it
applies
to
the
gambler.
and
there
--
and
there's
no
question.
in
my
mind,
that
the
--
these
records
were
admitted
solely
and
purely
as
evidence.
and
it
just
sought
us
for
you
to
say
that
these
were
instrumentalities
of
committing
an
offense.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
sir?
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
that's
--
that's
an
instrumentality.
what
--
there's
no
private
records
there
certainly.
i
mean,
there's
not
a
private
record
to
me.
it's
an
instrumentality.
the
only
thing
that's
--
that's
for
is
--
is
to
commit
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
well
[laughter]
oh,
i
--
pardon
me.
well,
i
mean
--
what
--
what
would
it
be
in
reno?
nothing.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
--
(voice
overlap)
--
unless
fixed.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
well,
are
the
records
correct?
are
the
records
that
they've
got
are
correct?
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
why
--
now,
you
--
you're
getting
me
completely
out
of
what
--
i
think
narcotics
come
under
a
completely
different
section
with
this
--
of
the
--
of
the
code.
mr.
john
f.
o'connell
i
mean,
the
traffic
in
--
in
narcotics
is
illegal
per
se.
anything
connected
with
it,
similar
to
the
maroon
case
just
like
in
maroon
case,
the
whole
thing
--
the
provision
was
no
good.
you
couldn't
--
you
couldn't
engage
in
provision
and
anything
connected
with
it.
and
as
i
think
somebody
else
said
in
this
court
is
still
on
the
bench,
that
maroon
case
that
they
cited
has
been
override
--
overwritten
by
the
go-bart
case
and
--
and
about
three
or
four
other
cases.
i
think
this
court
is
concerned
with
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
--
these
petitioners.
i
don't
think
this
court
is
concerned
with
the
fact
that
they're
--
they're
gamblers.
i'm
concerned
that
they
can
come
in
and
grab
my
papers.
and
--
when
they
--
when
this
gentleman
says
that
they
can
get
up
and
make
a
false
affidavit
and
still
it's
a
good
search,
then
god
help
america
because
that
isn't
the
law.
justice
douglas
said
in
--
in
one
of
his
concurring
opinions
in
--
in
the
jones
case
that
the
magistrate
must
issue
a
warrant
on
all
the
known
facts.
and
these
two,
purity
and
reverence,
they
conceal
the
fact
to
the
judge
that
they
were
issuing
at
large.
and
if
what
--
if
what
mr.
friedman
said
is
true
that
all
--
all
he
could
do
is
do
the
man
of
perjury,
we're
not
in
any
--
we're
in
difficulty,
gentlemen,
and
--
your
honors,
and
i
wish
i
have
more
time.
