the
longhand
notes?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
--
was
--
is
that
crossed
out
or
is
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
more
than
one
--
more
than
one
establishment
is
being
used
by
north
sales,
do
they
have
to
pay
a
registration
fee
for
each
establishment
or
just
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
suggestion
of
what
was
going
on
at
this
--
at
the
premises
that
were
searched
was
run
by
some
outfit
other
than
north
sales
with
which
prindable
(inaudible)
were
connected?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
agent
got
--
got
in
to
the
premises,
it
was
searched
and
found
the
stamp
tacked
up
on
the
walls,
would
you
say
he
is
still
can
go
ahead
and
execute
that
search
warrant?
justice
john
m.
harlan
without
having
to
go
back
and
make
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
him
say
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
way
you
state,
the
--
what
you
heard
from
the
district
attorney,
it
seems
to
me,
wholly
inconclusive.
i
don't
say
why
the
department
of
justice
can't
find
out
from
itself
whether
there
is
--
people
are
talking
across
purposes
and
then
if
it
is
to
do
the
appropriate
thing
in
this
case
instead
of
passing
the
back
down
of
the
district
court
against
it.
