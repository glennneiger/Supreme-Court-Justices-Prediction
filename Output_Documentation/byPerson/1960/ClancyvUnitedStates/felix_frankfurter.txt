justice
felix
frankfurter
regard
to
what?
in
regard
to
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
latter
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
--
are
these
documents
in
existence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
you
file
this
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thus,
the
government
taking
any
note
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
--
just
as
--
i'm
asking
a
few
questions
of
fact.
has
--
has
there
been
any
response
in
any
extra
note
form
by
the
government
to
your
denial
of
their
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
answer
is
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
assume
the
government
is
--
assume
the
facts
are
or
the
--
the
government
is
right
and
what
it
if,
what
difference
does
it
make
to
your
case
into
your
view,
does
it
--
is
it
a
serious
matter
to
--
to
what
you
contend
on
the
second
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
to
this,
it
would
be
--
it
would
meet
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
--
the
purpose
of
my
question
is
there
seems
to
be
a
conflict
of
--
of
fact
on
this
and
i
want
to
know
whether
the
conflict
of
fact
which
ought
to
be
capable
of
being
cleared
up.
i
want
to
know
if
this
conflict
of
fact
goes
to
the
merits
of
--
of
contention
of
yours
or
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
doesn't,
then
we
don't
care.
i
think
i
don't
care.
if
it
does,
then
i
think
it
would
clear
it
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
that
--
that
answer
if
you
read
it
towards
a
different
legal
justification,
then
the
fact
that
you
in
fact
that
carbon
copy
to
what
you
want.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
fact
is
that
this
controversy
about
the
carbon
copy
is
--
is
relevant
and
can
be
decisive
perhaps
as
to
so
much
as
to
what
you
can
relate,
as
to
one
it
relates
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
tried
this
case
below?
i
don't
--
i
mean
before
--
what
--
judge
of
the
case
rather.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
said
you
got
some
physical
documents
and
you
denied
that
you
ever
saw
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
file
--
you
served
the
department
here,
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
waller
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
happen
to
rely
on
argument
for
my
knowledge
to
the
facts.
i
--
i
get
the
rare
occasions
though
readably,
so
i
don't
know
what's
in
your
brief.
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
what
followed
this
search
and
seizure
that
you
moved
to
set
aside
to
get
back
that
you
--
would
you
have
knowledge
of
what
was
contained
in
the
affidavit
which
is
the
basis
of
the
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
that
but
did
you
know
after
you
began
or
your
(inaudible)
began
to
defend
the
--
did
you
know
that
there
was
a
search
warrant
through
which
seizures
were
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
note?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
that
motion,
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
motion
that
you
set
forth
of
the
search
warrant
was
a
warrant
for
a
non-existing
crime?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
did
you
give
us
ground
that
the
search
warrant
was
for
the
search
premises
on
the
basis
of
the
commission
of
a
crime
which
in
fact
haven't
been
committed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
mean
in
substance?
we're
now
here
in
substance
or
in
principle,
i
begin
to
be
suspicious.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
doesn't
tell
me
that
it
charges
a
crime
which
couldn't
have
been
a
crime
because
you
--
you've
done
what
they
charged
you
as
not
having
done.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
does
that
motion
come
to
issue
and
was
there
a
hearing
on
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
was
this
issue
contested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
was
there
an
issue
joined
that
in
fact
an
affidavit
alleged
the
crime
which
didn't
take
place
because
it
couldn't
have
taken
place
because
you
did
what
the
judge
you
would
not
have
done?
would
that
ever
come
to
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
so,
what
was
the
result
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
come
to
issue?
was
that
contested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
say
the
government
agreed
with
you
that
they
--
they
got
a
search
warrant
on
a
non
--
for
a
non-existing
crime?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
ruling
on
this
and
where
is
that
ruling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
ruling?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
section
4412
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
the
things
set
forth
and
the
district
judge
has
ordered
granting
the
search
warrant
for
an
addition
to
the
two
that
you've
mentioned,
that's
on
top
of
page
21.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
in
your
motion
to
suppress
--
just
curios.
you
did
not
explicitly
say
they
charged
you
with
three
specified
offences
and
in
fact,
you
did
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
law
as
to
each
one
of
the
three.
why
--
why
wasn't
that
set
forth
in
the
motion
to
suppress?
i
don't
mean
any
principle
or
any
substance
or
so
that
after
(inaudible)
in
corners,
why
wasn't
that
simple
fact
that
you
now
made
if
it's
legally
--
if
it
takes
care
of
the
invalidity
of
the
search
warrant
that
you
maintained?
why
wasn't
--
why
weren't
those
simple
concrete
allegations
you
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
can
you
under
--
in
attacking
a
search
warrant
by
a
way
of
a
motion
to
return
the
goods
seized,
is
that
the
place
to
try
the
truth
of
the
allegations
--
truth
of
the
affidavit,
presuming
it's
otherwise
sufficiently
specific
et
cetera,
is
that
the
place
to
try
the
--
the
crime
charged
in
the
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
district
attorney
(inaudible)
being
mistaken
either
as
to
the
year,
for
instance,
that
happens
not
frequently,
all
he
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
which
is
on
a
salable
on
its
face,
can
you
go
in
and
prove
that
it
wasn't
the
year
1957
or
1958
but
it
was
some
other
year
in
attacking
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
and
the
search
that
follows?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking.
i
--
i
don't
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
tried
the
--
you
tried
the
--
the
substantive
case
on
a
--
on
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
could
you
--
could
you
prove
the
falsity
by
proving
an
alibi?
it
--
it
takes
turns
on
presence
in
some
place.
could
you
say
we
are
prepared
to
show
that
this
is
false
because
the
warrant
in
chicago
are
a
bit
far.
a
bit
(inaudible)
or
whatever
it
is.
they
couldn't
do
that,
i
take
it.
in
other
words,
rule
41
addresses
itself
to
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
as
satisfying
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
do
any
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
quarrelling
what
you
conceive
to
be
a
duty,
i'm
asking
some
questions
of
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
is
that
deposed
of
the
problem?
if
--
if
a
search
warrant
--
let
me
put
this
case,
as
the
united
states
attorney
filed
an
affidavit
would
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
statute
and
at
the
time
that
he
filed
that
affidavit
was
the
time
the
judge
granted
the
--
issued
a
search
warrant.
it's
--
i
think
it's
testable
that
on
those
documents,
a
search
warrant
properly
issued,
can
you
then
say,
"oh,
you
changed
your
mind.
you
--
we
thought
you
were
going
to
charge
him
with
discipline
but
now
you're
charging
some
other
offense."
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
assuming
--
of
course,
i'm
assuming
that
he
is
not
committing
a
--
the
call
is
brought
on
the
court.i'm
assuming
he's
doing
this
thing
in
good
faith.
and
he
charges
the
year
and
it
should
be
another
year
where
he
charges
an
offense
which
on
further
consideration
and
think
some
other
statute
it
covers
the
circumstances.
that
happens
when
this
court
has
decided
a
thousand
years
ago,
so
that
it
would
be
50
or
60
years
ago
which
has
been
truth
moment
of
jurisprudence
is
nearly
a
thousand
years,
that
a
district
attorney
may
have
prosecuted
on
the
assumption
of
prosecuting
for
one
crime
labeled
as
such
and
put
it
all
out
on
the
fact
of
the
indictment
and
it
isn't
--
he
can't
make
good
on
that
crime
but
the
court
certainly
may
could
on
the
allegations
with
reference
to
another
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
settled
doctrine,
i
suppose,
never
been
questioned
in
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
whether
--
whether
there
was
probable
cause
and
what
were
assumed
to
be
the
fact
at
the
time
that
a
search
warrant
was
sought
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement
of
a
probable
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that
case
about
mr.
friedman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
let
me
see
if
i
understand
it.
does
that
mean
that
it
all
turned
on
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
here
with
fiscal
provisions
relating
to
wagering
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
this
goes
back
to
the
question
on
which
some
would
disagree.
am
i
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
where
it's
all
turned
on
the
(inaudible),
if
that's
the
name
of
the
case,
is
that
the
name?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
--
that's
what
the
anchorage
of
your
case
--
of
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
along
the
lines
of
(inaudible)
has
questioned.
if
an
income
tax
is
filed
giving
us
(inaudible)
giving
items
of
income
so
on,
then
a
search
warrant
he
had
set
forth,
if
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
there's
an
invasion
of
the
income
tax
in
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
save
his
income
on
past
portfolio
securities
which
we
know
are
in
his
--
in
his
study
in
his
house
at
1000
grand
riverview
avenue,
what
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
there
are
other
businesses
in
which
responds
to
the
rubric
of
business
address
or
business.
all
you
can
say
honestly
at
large
that
at
least
when
i
knew
something
about
that
ticket
sculptors
in
new
york,
i
suppose,
business
--
i
suppose
at
large.
they
move
from
the
hip
theatre
from
time
to
time.
there
are
ticket
sculptors
that
have
--
that
have
locality
that
localized
for
a
good
many
of
them
to
(inaudible)
i
didn't
know
about
it,
one
is
localized
at
all.
they
work
either
for
the
james
theatre
or
the
--
or
the
(inaudible)
theatre
or
what
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
hasn't
that
--
you
just
stated
the
proposition,
hasn't
that
been
before
the
court
and
been
adjudicated
in
the
way
in
which
you've
stated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
he
hasty
about?
what
is
he
hasty
about,
the
person
to
whom
he
turned
it
over?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
no
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
the
trial,
mr.
friedman?
when
--
when
--what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
is
the
date
of
this
suppose
occurrence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
less
than
two
years
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we're
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
inevitable?
i
just
wonder
why
the
department
doesn't
take
appropriate
steps
on
the
basis
of
the
information
that
has
come
to
it
to
supplement
ascertaining
what
the
facts
are
to
supplement
the
records.
you
just
said
in
answer
to
chief
justice's
question
that
what
you
are
presenting
to
the
court
as
the
result
of
this
interchange
between
yourself
and
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
took
place
in
court.
this
isn't
something
--
you
see
all
the
record
in
sense
that
the
record
doesn't
disclose
it,
doesn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
import
it
and
i
should
think,
i
don't
quite
understand,
why
the
department
didn't
take
appropriate
steps
to
make
presentation
to
this
court
that
it
wants
to
ascertain
the
fact
in
order
to
enlarge
or
--
or
correct
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
it
--
it
isn't,
to
put
it
mildly,
a
little
informal,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
be
derogatory
in
that
adjective.
it
isn't
that,
isn't
it?
we've
got
a
record
here
in
which
the
government
makes
a
statement
if
it
had
been
exceeded
to
by
the
petitioner,
that's
one
thing
but
it's
challenged
and
what
you
--
what
the
controversies
about
is
what
really
took
place
what
you
say
in
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
which
there
is
no
record.
well,
the
--
the
procedure
is,
i'm
familiar
with
is
--
if
that
so,
then
you'd
take
an
appropriate
step
to
correct
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
but
further
investigation
by
you
may
indicate
that
with
utmost
good
faith
on
everybody
part,
i
envy
the
person
who
never
had
an
experience
of
being
that
sure
about
something
which
turned
out
to
be
that
sure
of
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
be.
this
may
well
be
on
one
side
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
guess
one
does
still
wonder
why
you
didn't
resort
to
what
is
not
unfamiliar
practice
of
asking
the
enlargement
of
correction
or
addition
or
subtraction
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
today
is
true.
all
i
say
is
today
is
true.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
then
we
have
to
decide
affidavit
against
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
are
you
--
the
government's
position
there
feeling
justified
in
believing
that,
in
fact,
document
appropriately
called
for
by
the
defendant
at
the
trial
were
given
to
them.
so
that
the
--
so
that
that
portion
of
this
case
does
not
justify
reversal
of
a
conviction,
otherwise
jury
have,
if
kind
of
a
--
therefore
it
requires
an
ascertainment
of
the
facts
to
correct
the
record
if
that
turns
out
to
be
the
truth,
so
that
the
case
should
be
decided
on
what
actually
took
place
instead
of
--
instead
of
relying
merely
on
an
incomplete
record
when
there
should
have
been
a
complete
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
(inaudible)
against
trying
a
case
on
the
record
instead
of
trying
a
case
on
the
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
volunteered
by
him
or
was
it
some
solicitation
from
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
the
letter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
i'm
just
wondering,
i'm
just
looking
at
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
their
brief
was
filed
on
the
24th
of
september.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
letter
is
--
if
this
has
been
the
sequence
of
time
after
the
--
after
