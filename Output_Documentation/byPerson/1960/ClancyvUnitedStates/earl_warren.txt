chief
justice
earl
warren
--
et
al.,
petitioners,
versus
united
states.
mr.
waller,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
what
is
the
fact?
did
you
--
did
you
get
copies
of
these,
let
us
say
but
without
the
signatures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
never
saw
the
documents
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
purported
to
be
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that's
the
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
please,
just
one
counsel
at
a
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
does
the
"at
large",
the
term
"at
large"
have
any
other
significance
on
that
they
just
doesn't
have
any
state
of
place
in
doing
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
there
is
--
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
clearing
for
us
first
that
discrepancy
between
you
and
the
counsel
on
--
on
whether
they
were
turned
over.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
did
he
turn
it
over
to
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
did
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
--
may
ask
this.
did
the
united
states
attorney
swear
positively
that
they
were
turned
over
or
did
he
say
that
in
his
affidavit
that
mr.
mochel
had
told
him
that
they
were
turned
over?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
he
made
an
affidavit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
i
thought
there
was
an
affidavit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
i
wonder
if
i
have
the
sequence
of
this
--
this
seems
correct.
as
i
understand
it,
the
defense
asked
for
this
written
--
or
memorandum
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
rather
reports
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
they
asked
for
them
and
the
united
states
attorney
objected
to
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
united
states
attorney
took
no
position
of
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
been
wondering
why
if
--
if
the
united
states
attorney
didn't
give
them
up
presence
of
the
court.
why
would
give
them
up
at
all
after
the
court
said
it
was
necessary
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
could
have
been
called
on
the
basis
of
this
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
assuming
that
they
got
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
should
say
as
--
as
an
ordinary
fair
that
or
the
judge
denies
the
rights
to
the
defense
to
see
it
but
the
record
does
disclose
that
they
were
not
turned
over.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
intimation
in
there
that
they
were
turned
over
except
your
correspondence
with
the
united
states
attorney
beginning
september
26
of
this
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
why
doesn't
--
why
do
you
say
the
record
doesn't
--
doesn't
show
that
--
that
they
weren't
turned
over?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
united
states
attorney
participate
in
any
way
in
the
writing
of
the
briefs
or
--
or
in
the
argument
that
--
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
this
issue
was
raised
there
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
jencks
--
jencks
issue
wasn't
raised
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
in
that
--
at
that
time
and
since
then,
nothing
was
done
to
--
to
bring
out
this
point
that
the
united
states
attorney
had
delivered
these
things
to
--
to
the
defense.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
o'connell.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
o'connell,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
make
an
investigation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
friedman,
i
don't
know
how
the
others
feel
about
it.
but
i
personally
feel
that
with
the
case
in
the
posture
that
it's
in
the
present
time,
the
government
having
had
all
these
opportunity
to
make
investigations,
to
make
affidavits,
to
form
conclusions,
to
--
to
amplify
the
--
the
record
that
this
is
hardly
the
time
to
ask
for
such
a
procedure.
if
--
if
this
court
has
to
make
an
investigation,
we're
--
we're
asking
you
to
make
an
investigation
of
the
truth
or
the
falsity
of
the
affidavits
of
these
two
members
of
this
court
had
made.
personally,
i
don't
think
that's
fair.
i
don't
think
it's
right
to
--
to
any
counsel
on
the
record
of
this
kind
because
the
government
itself
is
going
clear
without
the
record
in
order
to
raise
this
issue.
and
now,
for
us
to
pass
the
government
to
--
to
investigate
these
gentlemen
to
see
whether
they're
telling
the
truth
is
--
and
--
and
if
we
conclude
that
they
are
not
telling
the
truth,
then
to
refer
it
back
to
the
trial
court.
i
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
agree
that
that's
fair.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
the
--
the
department
could
make
any
investigation
once
but
i
would
like
you
--
i
understood
that
you
are
not
making
any
investigation
at
the
request
of
this
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
