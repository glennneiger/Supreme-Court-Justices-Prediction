were
they

justice
william
j.
brennan,

(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
the
government
concedes
that
there
was
error
both
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
holdings
that
you
were
not
entitled
in
the
statements.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
their
defense
now
is,
in
fact,
you
got
carbon
copies
of
it
and
they
want
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
you
did
it,
is
that
it,
signed
in
carbon?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
did
in
fact
receive
it,
your
third
point
was
out
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
any
concession
by
the
government
that
that
statement
that
there
was
error
by
the
lower
court
to
not
saying
it
wouldn't
entitle
to
that
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
i
--
i
guess
i
gather
correctly
that
the
government's
making
this
representation
on
the
basis
of
something
that
the
final
counsel
for
the
government,
i
suppose,
you
--
you
--
here
in
washington,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
might
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
he's
not
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
this
--
this
document?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
you
indicted
for
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
plan
to
indict
it
for
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
neither
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
--
you
haven't
filed
any
affidavit
for
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
friedman?
if
that
address
had
been
included
on
this
11th
suit,
would
that
have
been
the
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
being
conducted
illegally
in
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wanted
to
--
what
--
my
next
question
was,
what's
the
significance
under
at
large?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
interrupt
once
more?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
counsel
said
that
--
has
filed
the
--
the
lines
which
appear
on
this
property
has
not
been
there,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
assuming
they
were
not,
what
would
be
the
significance?
that
was
not
struck
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
this
gets
me
back
on
the
statute
which
you
refer
previously,
subdivision
2
of
4412,
the
bottom
of
page
56.
if
he
does
not
operate
a
place
of
business
as
such,
this
would
satisfy
that
the
reports
at
large,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
five
minutes
of
the
ruling
or
how
--
is
there
any
other
provision
which
authorizes
that
kind
of
report
where
he
has
no
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
you
also
saying
that
those
provisions
of
the
affidavit
which
referred
--
especially
to
the
non-filing
of
11-c,
are
really
not
upon
the
truth.
is
that
right?
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
related
to
these
premises.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
no
such
11-c
had
ever
been
filed
as
to
those
premises.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
embraced
within
at
large
and
you
say
that
cannot
be
because
if
you
have
a
place
of
business,
then
you
can't
be
operative
for
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
just
curious,
mr.
friedman.
is
there
anything
else
on
which
authorizes
acceptance
of
at
large
application
except
that
you
referred
to
us
in
the
provision
as
posting?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i'm
still
bothered
about
that
"at
large",
mr.
friedman.
a
business
"at
large
-
2401
ridge
avenue,
how
is
it
--
do
you
have
any
evidence
how
he
--
this
was
treated
by
the
department
with
that
kind
of
filing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
had
referenced
to.
is
that
on
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
oh,
i
don't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
i
want
to
get
myself
quick
down
on
this
if
i
may.
apparently,
there's
some
significance
and
as
you
placed
in
the
fact
that
the
stamp
was
not
issued
at
large.
the
stamp
was
issued
with
the
address
2401
ridge
avenue
which
is
the
one
which
appears
next
to
business
following
the
--
the
specs
that
stricken
out
words
"at
large".
another
--
this
testimony
you
referred
me
to
mr.
heckelbech
indicates
that
if
you
want
it
at
large,
you
don't
--
you
must
not
look
on
the
address
down,
they
returned
it
to
you
and
you
have
to
make
a
choice
either
at
large
or
at
a
named
address.
and
i
gather
his
testimony
is
that
the
significance
was
striking
out
of
"at
large"
here
is
this
was
returned
that
the
applicant
had
to
make
an
election
did
elect
to
give
an
address
and
receive
the
stamp
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
see
if
i
get
that.
that
is
to
say
then,
mr.
friedman,
if
everything
you
have
in
this
case,
as
you
states
--
appeared
an
affidavit
so
related
to
2401
and
say
that
the
warrant
was
still
good,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
there
was
an
outstanding
registration
of
2401.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
i
see
but
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
probable
cause
would
appear
and
the
warrant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
remedy
then,
as
you
suggest,
is
that
there's
going
to
be
a
false
affidavit
some
prosecuted
person.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
wouldn't
say
that
those
--
this
was
2401
of
the
agents
walked
in
and
saw
the
stamp
on
the
wall,
the
question
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
these
were
2401,
they
--
you've
been
over
that
you
--
you,
i
take
it
is
that
the
warrant
nevertheless
maybe
executed
even
though
the
fact
stated
is
untrue
and
if
you
walked
in
and
you
find
the
--
the
stamp
on
the
wall.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
in
this
instance,
would
this
then
be
the
carrying
on
of
a
--
an
unlawful
business
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
the
premises?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
could
it
be
an
illegal
business
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
carrying
on
an
illegal
business
if
in
fact
the
--
this
is
a
registered
place
to
carry
on
just
that
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
telling
it
has
to
but
i
suggest
that
he
--
he
sees
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
sees
the
stamp
right
on
the
wall,
so
that
the
business
being
carried
on
then,
i
take
it,
as
lawful,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
our
set
of
facts,
the
2401
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
is
on
the
wall
a
stamp.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
walks
in
with
the
warrant,
he
sees
the
stamp.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
suggest
he
may
still
see
and
you
--
this
evidence
to
convict
of
a
crime
for
carrying
on
an
unlawful
business
when
in
fact
it's
a
lawful
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
what
purpose?
why
would
they
justify
the
seizing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
can
seize
it
only
if
it
is
an
unlawful
business
being
carried
on.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
can
seize
it,
you
say,
because
of
probable
cause,
they
can't
use
it
because
it
was
a
lawful
business.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
suggest
there
is
no
indication
it's
coercive.
the
court
would
justify
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
that
problem
isn't
here,
you
tell
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
makes
a
lot
of
(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
--
not
clear
whether
he
turned
it
over
to
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
or
to
defense
counsel.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
turned
over
to
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they
were
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
defense
would
be
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
if
two,
mr.
friedman,
here
we
have
the
two
trial
counsels
for
the
defense,
not
only
has
made
of
affidavits
but
they're
here
in
this
courtroom
personally
representing
to
this
court,
they
never
received
any
(inaudible)
what
do
we
supposed
to
do
with
that
kind
of
representation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
--
you
want
us
to
send
it
back
and
make
this
a
testing
of
credibility
of
the
internal
revenue
agent
and
these
two
attorneys,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
friedman,
he
would
not
--
have
had
to
argue
that
position
if,
in
fact,
they've
what
they
were
demanding,
they
were
entitled
to
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
you
now
say
they
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
have
you
found
out
what
it
was
they
learned
from
mochel
if
that's
his
name,
when
mochel
--
that
he'd
given
these
to
defense
as
you
say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
september.
