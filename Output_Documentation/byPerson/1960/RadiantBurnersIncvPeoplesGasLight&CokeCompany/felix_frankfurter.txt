are
you
eligible
as
a
member
of
the
aga?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
suggestion
that
you
are
excluded
from
sharing
in
the
setting
up
of
the
standards.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
properly
understand
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question
in
amount
to
saying
that
they
found
pleading
defects
which
therefore
are
remediable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
that
but
--
but
in
view
of
the
alternative
that
were
put
to
you
by
justice
black,
you
do
come
down
in
saying
that
if
this
(inaudible)
defects
in
pleading
and
not
--
no
matter
if
you
--
and
--
and
not
really
in
the
--
in
the
usual
sense
of
power
so
grave
as
no
matter
what,
you
can't
award
no
--
no
pleading
to
give
your
cause
of
action.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
suppose,
without
trying
to
defend
their
position,
i
suppose
one
could
say
that
when
you
say
even
though
there's
a
restraint,
you
beg
the
question.
they
say,
â€œunless
you
make
additional
allegation,"
there
is
no
restraint?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that's
what
they
--
that's
their
--
that's
their
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
your
position,
but
i
--
all
i'm
suggesting
that
they
were
ridiculous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
beg
the
question
as
broadly
as
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
that,
that
differ
--
differentiates
the
sherman
act
from
the
clayton
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
as
to
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
requirement
of
specifically
involving
the
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
when,
did
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said,
since
something,
which
i
didn't
hear.
you
said
this
is
not
--
this
is
a
body
of
law
which
at
least
since
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
weston,
may
i
ask
you
this.
this
opinion
isn't
the
most
exclusive
opinion
i
ever
read
in
my
life,
if
i'm
not
quite
clear,
but
does
the
opinion
--
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
opinion
makes
the
requirement
of
alleging
injury
to
the
public
as
a
phrase
of
art?
that
you
must
use
that
phrase
the
way
you
use
warranted
zone
in
the
17th
century?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
does
it
--
does
it
go
to
the
issuing
of
controversies
in
which
you
have
questioned
to
yourself
that
the
allegation
do
not
make
out
an
injury
to
the
public,
not
that
the
words
weren't
used.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
words
weren't
used.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
subject
matter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it's
the
question
of
finding
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose
nobody
have
a
physical
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
nobody
has
a
physical
object
here.
they
--
you
know,
lawyers
should
--
perhaps
those
appreciate
the
--
the
depths
of
the
--
of
ignorance
on
this
mechanical
phase
of
each
by
one
member
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
suggesting
that
we
can
lay
it
to
the
foundation
for
a
violation
of
the
sherman
law
that
people
persuaded
the
legislative
body
to
rule
out
as
unsafe
for
certain
commodities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
heard
it
said
--
i
heard
it
said
by
petitioner's
counsel
that
in
order
to
have
gas,
you
need
a
certificate
from
the
gas
company,
and
they
will
give
you
a
certificate
if
you
use
one
of
their
burners.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
--
isn't
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
alleged
that
there
was
some
kind
of
associated,
cooperated,
elected
action
as
between
aga
seal
and
the
gas
companies'
necessary
clearance
whereby
consumers
in
chicago
get
gas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
it
isn't
charged
that
the
utility
and
aga
were
in
cahoots
meaning
(inaudible)
but
what
the
consumer
--
what
the
utility
did,
it
did
on
its
own
and
not
as
a
result
of
any
agreement
with
your
client.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
suppose
--
suppose
that
it
were
unequivocally
charged
that
by
agreement
with
whether
they
love
the
aga
or
whether
they
have
advantages
coming
to
them
from
it,
suppose
it
were
unequivocally
charged
that
there
was,
in
fact,
an
agreement
between
the
utility
and
the
aga
whereby
no
consumer
service
will
be
given
to
anybody
who
hasn't
got
an
aga
burner.what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
be
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
been
exactly
what
you
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
--
if
i
may
interrupt.
if
utility
wholly
of
its
own
volition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
mean
if
--
you
--
if
it's
of
its
own
volition,
you
say
you
cannot
be
charged
with
what
they
do
even
though
they
think
your
seal
or
your
approval
is
as
protected
value
for
themselves
in
the
ground
of
stating
your
whatnot.
you
say
unless
there's
an
agreement,
you
can't
be
charged
of
what
they
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
an
agreement,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
would
be
within
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
until
we
get
down
here
to
a
question
of
what
being
these
words
telling
a
susceptible
of
meaning.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
distinguish
your
case
from
the
arrangement
between
international
garment
workers
and
the
new
york
garment
trade
whereby
they
put
on
the
products
of
the
people
within
--
the
manufactures
of
the
union
or
white
label
and
they
constitute
advertise
both
through
all
the
medias
especially
over
the
radios
telling
people
not
to
buy
this
that
haven't
got
that
white
label.
justice
felix
frankfurter
putting
aside
the
question
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
combination
between
the
aga
and
the
gas
company,
the
utility
of
chicago
whereby
the
utility
agreed
not
to
service
customers,
consumers
who
haven't
got
the
aga
burners.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
you
--
you
may
not
be
able
to
distinguish
that
(voice
overlap)
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
thinking
of
the
manufacturers.
they
are
going
to
shop,
give
these
high
wages
or
higher,
one
way
of
keeping
union
gather
is
to
meet
the
wage
advantage
as
union
(inaudible)
our
wages
are
higher,
our
health
conditions
are
better,
etcetera,
etcetera
but
we
have
a
principle,
you
know
there
are
(inaudible)
there
are
principles
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
by
this
campaign
as
between
the
manufacturers
and
the
(inaudible)
union,
we're
really
driven
or
at
least
restricted
in
our
market
because
of
the
big
departments
was
in
new
york
or
want
to
carry
those
that
haven't
got
the
white
label.
