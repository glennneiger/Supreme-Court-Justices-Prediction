stewart
before
you
proceed,
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
quite
sure
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
the
--
what
the
--
what
the
complaint
means
by
its
allegation
that
the
standards
are
not
objective
standards.
i
understand
the
words
but
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
don't
know
what
the
significance
is.
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
subjective
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they're
arbitrary
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
levy,
before
you
sit
down,
you
haven't
mentioned
the
lanham
act
at
all
or
its
effect,
and
i
have
presumed
that
your
position
would
be
that
that
would
be
a
matter
of
defense
to
be
filed
and
any
answer
is
filed
in
the
event
that
this
coerced
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
appeals
that
is
not
now
here,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
in
the
allegations
that
is
important?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
that
would
be
--
that's
a
matter
for
the
answer
and
the
permit.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
something
in
the
complaint
there
are
laws,
ordinances
against
these
things.
that's
part
of
the
complaint.
justice
potter
stewart
brought
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
has
to
be
local
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
their
column
next
week,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
somewhere
along
--
excuse
me.
somewhere
along
that
line
has
alleged
though,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
paragraph
(d)
(1)
on
page
7?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
then
by
the
following
conducts
and
actions,
one.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
by
refusing
to
supply
gas.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
just
the
sub
--
subparagraph
under
what
you
started
reading.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
their
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
a
matter
for
the
trial?
certainly,
on
the
allegations
that
the
chief
justice
has
just
suggested,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
top
of
page
13,
the
complaint,
perhaps
inartistically
but
i
should
say
if
the
complaint
alleges
that
not
only
this
manufacturer
of
ceramic
burners,
but
everyone
is
going
to
be
knocked
out
because
there's
an
allegation
that
the
only
ones
approved
are
metal,
this
man's
are
ceramic.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
in
the
present
test.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
what
happened
in
the
past.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
it
--
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
“all
gas
burners
approved
by
aga
are
metal.”
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
--
the
reasonableness
of
all
this
in
the
lanham
act
and
all
those
things
backs
us
to
the
safety
and
durability
and
the
--
all
the
other
items
bearing
on
the
reasonableness
of
all
these.
that's
a
matter
for
the
trial,
isn't
it?
rather
than
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
consideration
to
this
date.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
sell
less
gas
per
burner
or
more
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
less
gas
per
burner.
