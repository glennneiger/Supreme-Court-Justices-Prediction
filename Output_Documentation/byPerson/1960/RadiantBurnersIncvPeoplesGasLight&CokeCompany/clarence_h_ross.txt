mr.
clarence
h.
ross
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
and
the
merits
amicae
below
have
characterized
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
imposing
a
novel,
an
unjustifiable
burden
on
the
antitrust
plaintiffs,
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
public
has
been
injured
by
the
act
complained
of.
may
i
point
out
that
the
necessity
of
such
an
allegation
was
expressly
conceded
in
the
petitioner's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
on
file
with
this
court.
and
at
the
court,
petitioner
did
not,
as
it
does
here,
argue
that
the
public
injury
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense
prescribed
by
the
sherman
act.
in
its
brief,
it
conceded
these
words,
page
12,
“since
the
courts
have
repeatedly
held
that
public
injury
sometimes
must
be
shown
where
the
action
is
brought
by
a
private
litigant,
we
bow
to
those
decisions.”
i'm
explaining
some
of
the
reasons
why
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
it
did,
that
is
the
petitioners
here.
in
their
brief,
admit
the
necessity
of
showing
public
injury
where
the
action
is
brought
by
a
private
litigant.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
yes,
sir.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
i
--
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
really
hold
that.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
held
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
they
said
so
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
real
holding.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
all
right.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioner
urged
in
its
brief
a
showing
that
the
public
is
being
deprived
of
a
public
--
of
a
product
of
superiority
is
enough
to
show
injury
to
the
public.
that
is
to
say
the
petitioner
itself
defined
this
injury
to
the
public.
it
is
the
--
the
petitioner
said
the
reason
here
is
that
there
is
injury
to
the
public
is
that
the
public
is
being
deprived
of
a
product
of
superior
quality
that
they
say
that's
injury
to
the
public,
that's
what
they
said,
petitioner.
and
the
court
of
appeals
responded
this
issue
as
framed
by
the
petitioner
and
denied
relief
because
it
found
that
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner's
complaint
failed
to
establish
the
public
had
been
deprived
of
a
product
of
overall
superiority.
that
is
to
say
the
petitioner
framed
the
issue
in
the
court
below,
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
responded
to
that
issue
and
said,
“you
haven't
even
prove
this
issue
that
you
have
--
that
the
public
has
been
deprived
of
the
access
to
a
burner
of
superior
quality.”
and
this
does
not
--
i
do
not
believe
represents
the
court's
views
of
the
requirements
of
the
public
injury
doctrine
but
only
rejection
of
the
petitioner's
own
framing
of
the
issue.
and
i
can
--
would
like
to
cite
the
fact
that
the
court
below
states,
page
32,
“in
the
absence
of
per
se
violation,
the
sherman
act
protects
the
individual,
injured
competitor
and
affords
him
relief
but
only
under
circumstances
where
there
is
such
general
injury
to
the
competitive
process
that
the
public
at
large
suffers
economic
harm.”
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
think
that
it
have
to
show
injury
to
the
competitive
process
as
such.
and
i
do
not
think
that
only
the
showing
that
one
person
--
this
company
made
one
burner,
a
radiant
burner.
it's
the
only
burner
that
they
allege
has
been
shut
out
of
competition
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
and
nobody
else
makes
a
radiant
burner.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
distinguish
the
klor's
case
on
the
theory
that
that
is,
even
though
it's
not
to
called
a
per
se
case
in
that
it
is
a
per
se
case.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
no,
well,
it
is
this
kind
of
a
case
though,
i
distinguish
the
klor's
case
from
our
case
on
this
basis,
taking
examination
of
all
the
cases
where
public
injury
isn't
required
which
we
call
a
non-per
se
--
per
se
cases.
that's
the
general
term
we
--
we
use
at
a
per
se
case,
public
injury
is
not
required
and
in
the
non-per
se
case
it
is.
examine
the
practices
in
the
per
se
case.
examine
the
practice
in
the
klor's
case.
every
one
of
those
cases
involved
an
agreement
by
competitors
not
to
compete
in
some
area.
that
is
to
say
competitors'
agreement
not
to
compete
in
the
area
of
price
or
agreement
not
to
compete
in
areas
of
division
of
territory.
some
--
some
agreement
not
to
compete.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
think
it's
--
i
think
that
the
--
there
is
no
agreement
among
competitors
in
the
aga
case,
nor
our
case
here,
not
to
compete.
all
of
the
other
per
se
cases,
there
is
an
agreement
in
the
nature,
that
nature
where
they
agree
not
to
compete
in
some
kind
of
an
area.
i
think
that's
the
real
distinction
here.
and
i
think
that
the
court
goes
past
that
--
that
distinction
here.
it
has
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
yes.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
this
--
that's
not
exactly
our
situation
here
but
i
think
they
do
not
agree
to
compete
but
they
--
they
do
not
agree
not
to
compete
in
our
case.
there's
no
--
there's
not
that
angle
in
our
case,
and
we
think
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
that
that's
not
per
se.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
think
that's
not
enough
to
charge
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
it
must
show
public
injury
under
those
circumstances
unless
there's
actually
an
agreement
among
competitors
of
some
not
to
--
not
to
compete
in
some
area.
i
think
that
is
really
the
per
se
area
and
the
proper
per
se
area.
when
you
get
outside
that
area,
then
i
think
you
should
show
injury
to
the
competitive
process,
which
is
what
the
court
below
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
not
per
se.
i
think
you
have
to
show
public
injury.
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
complaint.
in
my
view,
the
petitioner
here
has
not
alleged
public
injury
in
the
sense
that
he
has
not
alleged
injury
to
the
public
but
only
that
he
has
alleged
that
my
particular
burner,
my
radiant
burner,
only
one
burner
has
been
shut
out
of
the
market.
he
hasn't
alleged
generally
that
the
public
has
been
harmed,
that
the
competitive
process
has
been
harmed
but
only
that
one
burner,
the
burner
made
by
him,
may
not
be
admitted
into
competition.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
think
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
you
have
the
type
of
agreement
to
compete
but
you
had
in
that
case.i
think
we
have
a
different
situation,
different
factual
situation.
this
is
not
a
division
of
markets.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
i'm
on
the
basis
--
well,
i'm
--
i'm
arguing
that
where
you
do
not
have
what
we
define
or
consider
a
per
se
case,
then
you
must
find
public
injury.
and
keeping
one
man
out
of
the
market
is
not
public
injury,
it
takes
more
than
that.
it
takes
--
it
takes
--
varies
to
the
competitive
process
to
create
or
to
constitute
public
injury.
and
that
therefore,
you
have
two
categories,
first,
our
basis
is
here
that
this
not
been
a
per
se
case.
you
first
must
find
public
injury.
if
it
is
--
if
public
injury
is
not
found
here
and
the
petitioner,
we
don't
think,
has
true
public
injury,
then
he
has
to
establish
a
per
se
case
and
that's
what
he
has
attempted
to
do.
and
we
say
that
he
has
not
proved
public
injury
and
therefore,
he
can't
establish
a
violation
unless
it
is
per
se,
and
we
also
say
he
has
not
established
a
per
se
case
because
he
has
not
come
within
the
essential
requirement
of
establishing
a
per
se
case
which
is
that
you
have
to
have
an
agreement
among
competitors
in
our
view
not
to
compete
and
that
that
is
not
our
situation.
some
areas,
let's
take
your
--
take
your
case,
we
think
--
as
the
per
se
cases.
your
klor's
case,
they
agreed
not
to
compete
for
this
man's
business.
your
price
fixing
cases,
they
agree
not
to
compete
with
respect
to
price.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
they're
not
buying
ceramic
burners.
well,
they're
not
--
they're
not
agreeing
not
to
compete
with
ceramic
burners
at
all.
i
think
they're
agreeing
among
themselves
that
--
that
the
ceramic
burner
does
not
meet
their
requirements
and
that
therefore,
they
want
to
prove
it.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
this
complaint
alleges
only
one.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
think
that'd
be
a
very
different
case.
let's
suppose
that
we
had
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
in
spite
--
let
me
state
the
case.
i
think
if
there
were
a
large
group
of
ceramic
burner
manufacturers
and
a
group
of
metal
burner
manufacturers
got
together
with
the
aga
and
with
the
distribution
companies
and
somehow
worked
out
a
plan
whereby
they
could
put
that
group
of
ceramic
burner
manufacturers
out
of
business,
i
think
it
would
be,
yes.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
not
--
not
if
it's
just
one
because
the
just
one
doesn't
show
the
necessary
public
injury
that
the
cases
require,
the
standard
oil
case
going
back
50
years
that
the
cases
require
where
you
have
--
do
not
have
a
non-per
se
injury.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
none.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
i
don't
think
that's
the
real
distinction.
that
is
the
distinction
as
whether
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
the
question
is
--
the
question
is,
how
much
has
the
competitive
process
been
restricted,
and
we
say
that
one
man
who
has
a
--
a
special
burner,
a
burner
with
special
characteristics
that
they
--
they're
keeping
the
one
man
out
of
business
without
a
showing
of
public
injury
is
not
sufficient
under
the
law
and
under
the
laws
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
here
by
this
court.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
i
suppose
it
would
depend
on
why
the
car
--
well,
i
can't
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
they
are
keeping
that
other
car
off
the
market
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
they're
keeping
the
other
car
off
the
market
by
selling
no
gas
that
is
the
gasoline
company
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
it's
like
the
gasoline
companies
say,
"we
won't
--
we
--
we
make
--
we
make
a
deal
with
the
automobile
companies
that
we
won't
sell
gas
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
all
right.
yours
--
your
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
all
right.
you're
citing
the
case
within
our
definition
of
per
se
where
they
agree
not
to
compete
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
for
the
market,
for
the
gas
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
of
just
one
car.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
who
has
refused
to
sell
the
gasoline?
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
that
involves
the
seller
of
the
gasoline.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
that's
the
klor's
case
because
the
--
the
competitors
get
together
and
say,
“we
will
not
compete
for
this
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
for
this
man's
business.”
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
yes.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
and
may
perhaps
--
you're
saying
that
the
automobile
companies
will
not
--
how
--
i
don't
see
--
i
don't
understand
how
the
man
--
how
come
the
man
can't
get
the
gasoline.
somebody
has
refused
to
sell
it
to
him.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
supposing
that
the
automobile
industry
sets
up
a
--
a
standard
and
they
say
that
--
i
--
i
hate
to
try
to
imagine
a
case
here
entirely
made
out
of
ceramics
or
ceramic
wheels
or
something
like
that.
and
they
say
that
we
don't
approve
this
kind
of
a
car.
i
--
i
don't
--
that's
not
our
case
so
i
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
just
don't
believe
that
--
that
the
court
has
ever
decided
in
the
absence
of
some
--
some
agreement
not
to
compete.
but
you
didn't
have
to
show
some
public
injury.
and
that's
our
--
that's
our
thesis
here
and
we
think
that's
the
distinction
between
the
klor's
case
and
between
the
radovich
case.
now,
on
the
radovich
case,
for
example,
which
the
petitioner
cites
and
the
government
cites
and
parmelee
cites.
you
have
there
an
admitted
monopolization.
there
can't
be
any
--
i
don't
say
that
the
radovich
is
a
per
se
case
but
it's
certainly
a
section
2
case.
and
when
you
have
a
section
2
case,
a
monopoly,
you
certainly
have
a
case
which
does
not
require
a
showing
of
public
injury.
and
therefore,
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated,
we
do
not
believe
that
either
the
klor's
case
because
it
is
really
a
per
se
case
where
competitors
do
agree
not
to
compete.
and
that
the
radovich
case
being
the
case
where
monopolists
maintain
their
monopoly.
but
neither
of
those
require
public
injury.but
our
case,
we
feel,
is
one
which
does
require
public
injury.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
standard
oil
case
where
the
court
pointed
out
50
years
ago
that
the
classes
of
acts
defined
in
section
1
are
broad
enough
to
embrace
every
conceivable
contract
or
combination
which
could
be
made
concerning
trade
or
commerce
or
the
subject
to
such
commerce,
and
thus
calls
any
act
done
by
any
of
the
enumerated
methods
anywhere
in
the
whole
field
of
human
activity
to
be
illegal
within
the
restraint
of
trade.
that's
now
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner.
all
you
have
to
show
is
a
restraint.
you
don't
have
to
show
if
it's
reasonable
or
anything
else.
this
is
--
position
is
that
if
it
falls
in
the
letter
of
the
law,
within
the
letter
of
section
1,
that's
the
end
of
it.
you
don't
have
to
show
public
injury,
you
don't
have
to
show
any
effect
on
competition
whatever.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
we
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
restraint.
and
we
think
that
it
is
not
public
injury.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
we
don't
know.
well
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
don't
know.
no,
i'd
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
have
no
--
i
can't
assume
that
they'll
knock
out
the
next
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
ceramic
burner.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
he
alleges
we
did.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
he
alleges
we
did
--
he
--
we
did
so
far
as
he's
concerned
refuse
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
him
the
seal.
that
doesn't
mean
the
next
man
who
comes
in
with
a
ceramic
burner
may
not
get
the
seal.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that.just
this
one
man
is
eliminated.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
he
said
no
and
he
didn't.
he
said,
“we
were
eliminated.”
he
didn't
say
there's
a
course
of
conduct
designed
here
to
eliminate
all
manufacturers
of
ceramic
burners.
he
didn't
say
that.
he
said
--
he
said
the
reason
that
we
have
public
injury
here
is
that
i
have
a
superior
burner.
i've
got
the
best
burner.
and
the
public
is
injured
by
not
having
access
to
buy
my
burner,
my
--
my
superior
burner.
and
the
court
below
said
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
that's
not
public
injury.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
don't
know.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
think
that
you
--
in
the
absence
--
as
i
say,
i
don't
use
dirty
--
the
word
per
se
is
sort
of
a
short
cut.
in
the
absence
of
a
per
se
violation,
then
i
think
you
got
to
look
into
the
question
of
the
reasonability
of
the
denial.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
it
says
the
only
ones
which
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
it's
the
only
that
have
been
approved.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
one
says,
the
only
ones
which
have
been
approved
are
metal,
that's
right.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
that's
as
of
the
time
of
the
complaint.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
i
think
that's
right.
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
necessarily
follow
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
the
chief
justice
asked
me
whether
i
thought
they
would
approve
a
--
a
second
manufacturer
of
--
of
ceramic
burners.
and
i
say,
i
think,
there's
nothing
in
here
that
says
they
won't.
i
don't
know
if
it
were
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
don't
know.
[laughter]
no,
i
--
i
think
if
the
ceramic
burner
is
50%
more
efficient
than
the
other
burner,
there's
very
likely
to
be
a
lot
of
them.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
the
gas
companies
--
the
gas
distribution
companies,
if
we
could
find
a
burner
that's
50%
more
efficient
than
the
burners
we
got
now,
we'll
certainly
like
to
have
it.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
speaking
for
the
people's
gas
company,
if
somebody
had
a
burner
that
is
50
--
50%
more
efficient
than
any
other
burner,
we
wouldn't
give
a
hoot
what
the
aga
said.
we'd
go
ahead
and
sell
it.
if
we
wouldn't
sell
it,
we
would
go
ahead
and
approve
it
if
we
thought
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
it's
all
right.
we
--
we
can
sell
--
we
can
sell
less
gas.but
we
could
sell
more
gas.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
less
gas
per
burners.
we
could
sell
lot
more
--
more
gas
and
we
could
compete
much
more
effectively
with
the
oil
burner.
if
we
had
a
more
efficient
burner,
we
would
love
to
have
a
burner
that's
50%
more
efficient.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
oh,
i
agree
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
agree
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
that
--
i
agree
with
what
the
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
--
what
the
record
said.
i
don't
deny
that.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
well,
the
complaint
says
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
agree.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
no,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
wasn't
saying
the
complaint
says
something
else.
i
was
just
responding
to
a
question
of
whether
--
whether
or
not
the
radiant
burner
--
whether
we
had
ever
approved
a
radiant
burner.
well,
that
was
the
question,
“would
you
ever
approve
a
radiant
burner?”
and
i
said
that
so
far
as
we're
concerned,
if
it
were
a
good
burner
and
50%
more
efficient,
as
a
gas
company,
we'd
love
to
have
it.
and
that's,
i
know
is
outside
the
record.
mr.
clarence
h.
ross
i
just
have
one
statement
i
wish
to
make
and
that
is
i
wish
to
point
out
that
in
the
complaint,
there
is
no
allegation
of
any
plan
of
successive
or
other
proposed
denials
of
anyone
else.
all
it
says
in
the
complaint
is
that
our
device
was
denied
to
seal.
nothing
there
just
spell
out
that
this
is
like
in
the
result
in
being
an
a,
b,
c,
d.
they
don't
say
that.
they
don't
allege
it.
they
don't
even
allege
that
the
denial
and
the
particular
case
was
arbitrary.
thank
you.
