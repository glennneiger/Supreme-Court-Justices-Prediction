mr.
mr.
attorney
general
mr
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
your
honor,
asked
me
to
put
something
aside
at
the
beginning
of
your
question.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
to
distinguish
it
and
i
will
come
to
answer
your
question
because
--
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
because
our
case
is
dependent
upon
a
conspiracy
here.
now,
there
is
a
possible
distinction
along
this
line.
if
we
approach
the
sherman
act
question
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
has
this
done
to
competition?
we
might
well
say
that
the
international
garment
workers'
case
is
a
situation
of
waging
competition,
that
the
improvement
of
the
conditions
of
labor
is
important
to
competition
because
its
labor
who
buys
the
products.
this
is
an
entirely
different
case
than
a
case
which
is
not
waging
competition
but
was
--
which
is
waging
anti-competition
because
our
competitors
are
part
of
this
conspiracy.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
yes.
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
i
--
i
have
no
answer
other
than
that
which
i've
stated
and
that
is
that
it
possibly
improves
competition.
i'd
like
to
make
only
two
brief
remarks.
mr.
ross's
closing
remark
was
that
the
complaint
does
not
allege
and
effect
on
anyone
but
the
petitioner.
the
complaint
does
allege
that
this
conspiracy
has
prevented
everyone
who
does
not
get
the
aga
seal
of
approval
from
competing
in
this
market.
now,
what
i
think
he
has
overlooked
is
the
potential
effect
of
a
power
similar
to
the
power
that
the
aga
has.
in
other
words,
they
don't
have
to
say,
“we
won't
approve
it.”
no
one
is
going
to
come
into
the
market.
no
one
is
going
to
invest
the
capital
and
time.
if
they
know
that
their
competitors
can
say
after
their
product
is
ready
to
be
marketed,
sorry
you
can't
market
--
market
it.
now,
the
second
point
was
this.
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
chief
justice,
mr.
lamb
said,
“i
believe
that
the
present
standards
of
the
aga
do
not
restrict
gas
burners
to
metal
that
it
was
possible
for
a
ceramic
burner
to
be
approved.”
mr.
mr.
attorney
general
that's
how
i
understood
him,
mr.
chief
justice
in
his
brief.
on
page
5,
mr.
lamb
says,
“aga
standards
require
that
metal
be
used.”
in
his
brief
on
page
14,
he
says,
“all
gas
burners
approved
by
aga
are
metal.”
thank
you.
