incorporated,
petitioner,
versus
peoples
gas
light
and
coke
company
et
al.
mr.
levy,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
allege
that
yours
are
as
durable
and
safe
as
the
--
as
the
others?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
would
you
mind
or
--
or
do
you
know
what
the
reason
is
for
the
fact
of
all
the
200,000
applications
in
illinois?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
is
a
short
supply
of
gas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
and
is
that
just
in
illinois
or
is
that
in
these
other
states
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
may
i
ask
you?
is
it
fairly
--
were
ad
hoc
decisions
that
--
that
limited
to
metal
appliances
or
is
it
in
their
constitution
or
their
bylaws
or
something
that
it
should
be
limited
to
metal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
must
be
metal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weston.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr
lamb.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
going
to
discuss
any
further
the
membership
of
the
--
of
the
organization
as
alleged
in
full?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
thought
that
you
passed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
passed
over.
but
it's
all
right,
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
under
your
--
under
your
standards,
could
they
--
could
they
ever
qualify
with
the
ceramic
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whose
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whose
reply
brief
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
maybe
you
would
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
maybe
you
would
have
the
answer
because
you
represent
the
aga.
could
you
--
could
you
ask
--
answer
that
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
your
answer
then
that
it
could
be
a
--
a
ceramic
could
be
approved
by
your
organization
without
violating
your
standards?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
said
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
the
reason
i
asked
you
this
because
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
the
standards
that
you
have
set
up
limit
your
approval
to
metal
contrivances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
but
that
isn't
exactly
what
i
asked.
i
asked
if
--
if
it
is
true,
as
counsel
has
stated,
that
your
standards
limited
--
limit
appliances
such
as
this
to
metal
appliances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
wasn't
interested
in
that.
i'm
just
interested
if
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
standards
you
had
set
up
limited
your
approval
to
metal
contrivances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
thought
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
what
that
merchant
wanted
to
do
in
the
klor
case?
he
wasn't
out
of
business.
he
was
still
transacting
in
business.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
tell
us
a
little
about
the
membership
of
this
organization
which
you
have
done.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ross.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
according
to
that
argument,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
how
many
manufacturers
situated
this
as
petitioner
is
--
who
is
shutout
of
the
market
by
your
organization.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
you
--
you've
been
arguing
it
to
a
greater
extent,
you're
just
broadening
that
out.
now,
suppose
that
all
ceramic
manufacturers
and
suppose
there
are
a
number
of
them
who
were
shut
out
by
the
kind
of
activity
such
that
are
charged
here,
would
that,
in
your
opinion,
be
a
violation
of
the
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
would
it
--
would
it
be
a
violation?
i
just
--
i'd
like
to
test
your
reasoning
a
little.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
if
it
was
just
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
your
conspiracy
starts
early
enough
when
the
first
ceramic
manufacturer
comes
into
business,
you
can
keep
them
up
forever.
but
if
they
--
if
you
don't
start
so
early
and
if
you
haven't
get
in
to
the
business,
then
you're
in
trouble.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
--
why
doesn't
it
follow?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
assuming
his
facts
are
correct,
as
stated
in
his
complaint,
is
that
a
reasonable
restraint
as
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
every
time
a
ceramics
manufacturer
comes
into
the
industry,
you
knock
him
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
because
it's
--
it's
reasonable
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
you're
free
to
compete?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
--
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
alleges
that
you
do.
he
alleges
that
you'll
knock
him
out.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
how
they
can
prove
it
either
but
he
says
in
his
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
but
he
alleges
--
he
alleges,
sir,
in
--
in
his
complaint
that
these
utility
members
are
in
the
conspiracy
by
refusing
to
provide
gas
for
use
in
plaintiff's
radiant
burner
and
other
gas
heating
devices
and
equipment
produced
by
other
manufacturers
which
are
not
approved
by
aga.
you
say
that
you
would
do
it
whether
you
wouldn't
care
a
hoot
what
aga
said,
but
isn't
that
a
matter
of
defense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
alleges
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
alleges
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
complaint
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
states
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
i
didn't
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
--
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
so
understood
it.
