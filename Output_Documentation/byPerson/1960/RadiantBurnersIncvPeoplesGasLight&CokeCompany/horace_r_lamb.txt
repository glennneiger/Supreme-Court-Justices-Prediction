1919.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
respondent,
the
american
gas
association
incorporated.
it's
alleged
to
be
a
membership
corporation
organized
on
the
laws
of
new
york.
it
follows
i
think
that
you
can
safely
assume,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it's
not
engaged
in
commerce.
the
alleged
illegal
conspiracy
in
combination
that
is
attempted
to
be
stated
in
this
complaint
is
said
in
paragraph
(4)
to
be
revolving
around
membership
in
the
american
gas
association.
and
i
think
that
we
can
take
it
that
there
isn't
a
thing
that
alleged
constituting
an
illegal
conspiracy,
combination,
agreement,
combination
in
the
form
of
trust
or
otherwise
except
the
membership
in
the
american
gas
association
and
the
acts
of
the
american
gas
association
that
are
involved
in
this
complaint.
and
i
think
the
only
useful
function
that
i
can
serve
to
this
court
is
to
go
through
this
complain
briefly
and
show
you
that
this
is
the
case,
your
honors,
where
the
plaintiff
has
pleaded
so
much
when
it
comes
to
the
precise
particular
facts,
he's
pleaded
himself
out
of
court.
and
the
decisions
below,
three
times
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
came
to
that
conclusion.
now,
the
only
business
so
called
that
the
american
gas
association
is
alleged
to
do
is
to
send
its
inspectors
systematically
into
the
northern
district
of
illinois
to
inspect
the
products
of
manufactures
of
gas
equipments
whose
products
have
been
approved
and
listed
by
aga.
that's
in
paragraph
(2).
the
plaintiff
here
is
a
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
illinois.
there
is
no
allegation
it's
a
small
corporation
or
a
large
corporation.
it's
a
corporation,
and
there
is
no
fact,
no
basis
for
saying
what
its
size
is
or
is
not.
there
were
also
named
as
defendants
here,
gas
utilities,
manufacturers,
pipe
line
companies.
and
there
are
references
to
the
statistics
that
are
published,
i
refer
on
r6
for
example,
that
have
been
published
from
time
to
time
by
the
american
gas
association.
and
there,
the
standard
is
reliably
estimated
by
the
defendant
aga
between
the
years
1960
and
1974,
were
42
million
space
heaters,
17
million
floor
and
wall
furnaces
and
19
million
central
heating
units,
including
replacements,
will
be
installed
in
the
united
states.
we're
talking
therefore
on
the
basis
of
what
aga
has
compiled
and
what
aga
has
done
as
a
public
service.
to
inform
the
public
regarding
this
industry
and
i
think
i
can
safely
say
its
acts
are
devoted
to
promoting
the
gas
industry
in
this
great
country
of
ours.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
--
i
think
i
will
do
so,
your
honor.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
(inaudible)
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes,
the
members.
i
--
i
crossed
over
that
so
generally
but
i
think
i
want
to
take
my
time
to
come
to
the
significant
claims.
but
i
want
to
go
right
to
that,
if
i
may,
in
just
a
moment.
now,
there
is
an
allegation
in
--
in
very
conclusory
terms
of
controlling
the
manufacture,
sale
and
use
and
installation
of
gas
burners.
general
language
concededly
is
in
this
complaint.
but
i
submit
there
are
also
specific
allegations
to
which
i'll
refer
in
a
moment.
now,
one
of
the
first
factual
allegations
regarding
american
gas
association
is
on
page
6,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
defendant
aga
has
laboratories
in
cleveland,
ohio
and
los
angeles,
california.
each
of
which,
he
uses
the
words
“purport”
in
speaking
of
the
facts,
concede
the
facts,
to
test
the
utility,
durability
and
safety
of
gas
burners
and
gas
equipment.
and
i'd
like
to
pause
right
there
and
turn,
if
may,
to
page
9
and
say
that
the
plaintiff
has
also
alleged
in
paragraph
(8)
in
his
purported
injury
to
the
public
allegation,
saying
that
aga
purports
to
approve
only
products
which
are
safe,
substantial.
and
i
express
the
word
here
"substantial,
durable,
and
efficient",
and
i'll
come
to
the
remainder
of
that
in
a
moment,
if
i
may,
in
good
order.
but
i
do
think
it
--
it
should
be
mentioned
here
because
we
are
dealing,
i
think,
in
large
part
with
this
characteristic
of
the
substantiality
of
the
radiant
burner,
as
i
shall
endeavor
to
develop
in
a
moment.
now,
the
next
paragraph
on
page
7
merely
alleges
that
defendant
gas
burner
and
equipment
manufacturers,
some
of
which
are
in
competition
with
the
plaintiff
along
with
the
utilities
and
the
peoples
gas
are
--
or
have
been
represented
on
the
committee
of
aga.
it
is
not
true,
as
my
adversary
endeavored
to
point
out
to
you,
that
the
competitors
control
the
acts
of
aga
in
these
tests.
there
isn't
any
allegation
of
that
fact.
the
most
that
can
be
said
and
the
fact
that
we
concede
is
that
they
are
represented
on
the
committee
and
that's
perfectly
proper
thing
to
have
the
representatives
of
people
who
manufacture
these
products
participate
as
manufacturers
on
the
aga
committee
which
decides
whether
or
not
gas
burners
and
equipment
wore
an
aga
approval.
but
there
isn't
any
allegation
anywhere
in
this
complaint
that
they
control
each
and
every
test,
in
each
or
every
decision
and
each
and
every
approval
or
failure
to
give
approval
by
these
two
gas
laboratories.
now,
there,
it's
alleged
there
the
power
to
influence
on
the
part
of
utilities.
but
again,
let's
keep
in
mind
that
this
is
a
combination
involving
membership
in
aga
and
what
aga
does.
but
i
think
paragraph
(d)
on
page
7
has
some
significance.
there,
it
is
alleged
by
this
petitioner,
it
is
not
possible
to
successfully
sell,
market
and
distribute
gas
equipment
including
radiant
burners,
manufactured
by
plaintiff,
which
are
not
approved
by
aga.
well,
i
think
we
can
take
it
as
a
reasonable
inference
that
the
petitioner
is
in
commerce
that
it
does
sell
what
it
would
like
to
sell
more.
it
would
like
to
sell
it
so
that
it
can
regard
itself
as
successfully
selling
and
marketing
its
product.
then
it
continues
because
we
effectuate
the
plan
and
the
purpose
of
this
unlawful
combination,
which
i
have
already
referred
to.
now,
the
refusal
to
provide
gas
is,
of
course,
something
which
no
one
here
can
absolutely
control.
the
utilities
are
as
i
think
has
been
indicated
by
the
questioning
from
the
bench
subject
to
the
public
utility
commission
to
their
various
states.
and
if
the
costumers
denied
service,
his
grievance,
of
course,
is
to
go
to
his
commission,
state
the
facts
and
the
commission
will
deal
with
the
matter.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
i
--
i
think
it's
a
fact
that
you
must
take
a
judicial
notice
officer
there
that
the
public
utilities
by
law
--
by
general
account
of
practice
are
subject
to
jurisdiction
of
the
regulatory
body
from
their
states
and
it
isn't
up
to
utility
to
override
the
commission.
in
fact,
they
are
regulated
by
the
commission
that
it's
the
common
practice.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
--
let's
take
it
as
in
--
in
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
pardon
me,
sir.
let's
take
its
entirety,
by
refusing
to
provide
gas
for
use
in
plaintiff
radiant
burner
and
other
gas
heating
devices
and
equipment
produced
by
other
manufacturers,
which
are
not
approved
by
aga.
there
is
the
--
that's
the
whole
paragraph.
now,
we're
going
to
come
to
in
a
little
moment
about
this
approval
by
aga.
it
is
alleged
further
along
that
we
have
endeavored
the
aga
and
utilities
on
the
next
page
to
use
municipalities
and
other
government
agencies
to
pass
ordinances.
there
was
a
question
about
that
from
the
bench
and
require
that
no
equipment
shall
be
used
within
its
limits
unless
that
gas
burner
equipment
bears
the
seal
of
approval
of
aga.
and
there's
a
further
specific
illustration
given
later
in
the
complaint
about
the
experience
up
in
milwaukee
where
the
--
that's
on
page
15,
sirs.
the
reference
was,
"it
violated
a
city
ordinance
which
provided
that
no
gas
burner
could
be
used
other
than
those
approved
by
aga
or
equal."
in
other
words,
it
could
have
been
some
other
laboratory
or
some
other
standard
provided
it
was
equal
to
those
established
by
aga.
i
want
to
continue
on
the
various
matters
that
are
the
manner
of
--
of
carrying
out
this
unlawful
combination.
i've
referred
to
one
that
i
think
is
the
significant
act
so
far
as
to
fix
my
client
the
laboratories.
and
it
is
said
there
that
the
tests
made
by
aga
are
not
based
on
valid.
well,
what
is
valid?
maybe
difference
of
opinion
on
varying
--
this
whole
industry
is
changing
all
the
while,
objectives
standard.
i'll
show
you
in
a
moment,
your
honor,
that
by
the
affirmance
of
this
complaint
certainly,
one
objective
standard
is
alleged
in
this
complaint,
namely,
that
the
appliances
that
are
approved
by
aga
are
metal.
and
the
plaintiff's
burner
is
of
ceramic
material.
now,
i
think
i
could
pause
here
to
say
that
ceramic
is
defined
in
the
dictionary
as
pertaining
to
pottery,
the
art
of
molding,
modeling
and
baking
in
clay.
so,
you
have
here
a
very
definite
specific
factual
allegation
of
an
objective
standard.
and
that
is
shown
--
i'll
jump
around
to
fit
in
this
complaint,
and
i'm
doing
it
to
save
time,
but
to
come
to
what
i
think
is
the
heart
of
the
matter.
the
alleged
injury
to
the
public
is
that
aga
purports
to
approve
only
products
which
are
safe,
substantially
durable
and
efficient.
and
then
it's
alleged,
plaintiff
has
tendered
the
radiant
burners
to
aga
for
approval
on
two
occasions.
and
aga
has
not
approved
such
radiant
burner.
for
now,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
something
must
have
been
said
in
the
first
--
as
a
result
of
the
first
test
that
induced
the
radiant
to
try
a
second
test
which
he
did.
but
the
complaint
doesn't
tell
you
one
word,
not
a
sound
is
uttered
in
this
complaint
about
what
was
said
in
these
reports
of
the
test
made
in
these
laboratories.
they
were
left
completely
in
the
dark
about
that.
now,
i
say
that
if
he
was
induced
to
make
a
second
try,
there
isn't
any
reason
why
he
should
make
a
third
try
or
other
tries.
aga
--
there
isn't
anything
in
fact
showed
here
that
it
denied
its
laboratory
to
anyone.
thus,
the
plaintiff
voluntarily
came
to
its
doors
and
asked
for
its
test,
and
it
was
not
refused.
there's
no
allegation
that
anyone
has
ever
been
refused
the
tests
by
aga
and
its
laboratories.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
would
--
you
answered
me
the
question,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
--
i
would
say
that
there
is
an
interesting
note
in
the
footnote
of
the
reply
brief
which
gives
some
recent
references
to
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
--
scientific
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
the
petitioner's
reply
brief,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
where
he
--
he
pointed
out
that
in
those
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
(voice
overlap)
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
i
think
the
best
answer
to
give
is
that
we
have
tested
the
ceramic
material,
sir,
and
the
particular
details
of
what
is
the
standard
are
nowhere
in
this
complaint.
but
there
isn't
any
reason
to
believe
that
if
a
ceramic
is
properly
connected
to
a
metal
gas
pipe,
in
its
common
knowledge,
i
think,
i
may
say
that
gas
must
be
led
into
a
consumer's
place
of
consumption
by
a
metal
pipe.
and
the
important
thing,
of
course,
is
to
find
someway
to
connect
a
ceramic
material
to
the
metal
so
that
it
is
safe
and
it
is
substantial
and
it
is
durable
and
there
isn't
any
risks,
at
least
so
that
it
will
stand
up
when
subjected
to
these
test
and
there
isn't
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
--
i
would
say
it
could.
it
could
be.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
now,
all
he
says
in
that
regard,
your
honor.
it
makes
one
statement,
and
that's
over
on
page
13
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
that.
he
says,
“all
gas
burners
by
approved
by
aga
are
metal,”
speaking
as
of
the
date
of
this
complaint.
and
he
says
that
metal
is
subject
to
corrosion
due
to
dampness
and
ashes
produced
by
the
combustion
of
gas.
and
the
very
next
sentence
says,
“radiant
burner
is
made
of
ceramic
radiant.”
it
goes
on
to
term,
“pervious
to
moisture
and
ashes,
it
cannot
corrode.”
well,
there
maybe
of
any
other
qualifications
and
characteristics
that
are
necessary
to
a
plan
on
determination
of
safety
substantiality
and
durability.
they're
not
all
set
out
in
this
complaint.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
no,
sir.
there's
no
allegation
that
they
are
limited
to
metal.
my
answer
to
you
has
no
allegation
to
this
complaint
that
they
are
limited
to
metal.
all
it
says
is
that
those
that
have
been
approved
so
far
as
to
the
date
of
this
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
but
the
standards,
your
honor,
i
had
to
have
an
engineer
to
help
me
out
on
this,
of
course,
but
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
had
to
have
an
engineer
to
tell
you
in
detail
that
they
--
the
degrees
of
heat
to
which
a
burner
is
subjected,
the
number
of
hours
that
it
must
burn,
the
pressures
and
all
that.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
no.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
no,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
and
there's
no
allegation
to
that
affect.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
my
answer
is
to
your
interest
that
way.
they
are
not,
they
are
not,
and
i
know
of
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
continue
with
improvements
based
on
the
suggestions
that
maybe
made
to
them
by
aga
to
meet
aga
standards.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
oh,
might
just
--
mr.
justice
black,
we
are
certainly
not
operating
under
nlra.
we're
operating
under
a
plan
to
give
the
public,
by
our
aga
seal
of
approval,
an
indication
that
based
on
our
tests
in
our
--
in
our
laboratory,
this
particular
plan
that
bears
our
seal
of
approval
is
--
as
result
of
such
tests
to
be
regarded
as
safe,
substantive,
durable
and
a
good
piece
of
equipment.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
very
quite
erroneous
construction
of
this
complaint
as
a
whole,
if
i
may
say
so.
the
combination
in
conspiracy
involves
only
the
membership
in
this
aga
and
what
this
aga
does.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
aga
doesn't
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
say
that
everything
that
these
members
have
done
related
to
aga
activities
including
the
issuance
of
the
seal
of
approval,
shows
a
course
of
conduct
in
this
respect,
and
i'd
like
to
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
at
the
same
time,
shows
the
course
of
conduct
regarding
the
testing,
the
granting
of
the
certification,
the
right
of
a
seal
of
approval
which
is
the
course
of
conduct,
sir,
that
is
in
all
respects
in
accord
with
what
is
provided
in
the
lanham
act.
we
do
not
claim
that
the
lanham
act
is
referred
to
specifically
in
this
complaint,
but
we
do
say
that
since
they
refer
to
a
seal
of
approval,
if
that's
about
the
same
as
the
mark.
and
that
the
acts
done
are
completely
in
harmony
with
what
is
permitted
to
be
done
under
the
lanham
act.
and
we
say,
therefore,
that
the
giving
of
a
seal
of
approval
or
a
mark,
if
i
may
use
that
term
here,
is
just
like
any
other
trademarks.
and
whatever
interference
may
be
due
a
product
that
doesn't
bear
that
mark,
that
is
an
entirely
reasonable
interference.
in
other
words,
the
place
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
shall
be
public
acceptance
by
the
radiant
burner
or
by
our
burner
with
our
mark
is
not
a
--
a
question
to
the
court,
it's
a
question
to
the
market
place.
if
it's
the
public
that
really
believe
everything
that
they
say
about
their
burner,
they
don't
have
to
have
aga
approval.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
they
are
selling
them
to
their
--
today,
sir,
that's
one
answer.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
they
--
they
overstated
if
i
may
say
so.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
when
they
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
don't
think
it
is,
sir
--
are
not
under
the
antitrust
laws.
they
haven't
stated
anything
that
constitutes
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
and
i
think
they
must
allege
that
to
bring
themselves
in
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
that,
sir,
was
certainly
a
per
se
where
they
precluded
one
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes.
i
think
you
used
the
word
per
se
there
that
that
act
of
preventing
the
klor's
store
from
having
a
particular
appliance
was
regarded
as
an
inherent
wrong
and
a
per
se
violation.
and
that
was
the
--
the
--
as
i
read
the
klor
case.
now,
this
doesn't
come
within
the
klor
case
then
come
close
to
it.
they
are
selling.
they're
selling
to,
i'm
sure,
lots
of
dealers
all
over
the
country.
they
think
they
could
sell
more
if
they
could
get
our
seal
of
approval.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
he
could
not,
sir.
he
could
not
get
the
particular
appliance
from
the
supplier
who
refused
him
sales
and
deliveries
of
that
appliance.
absolutely
precluded
him
from
selling
that
particular
appliance,
so
that
was
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
--
i
know
of
no
such
facts,
sir.
no,
it's
not
--
not
in
the
fact.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
not
in
this
complaint,
sir.
i
don't
read
it
in
this
complaint.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
(d)
(1)
on
page
7,
it
says
“it
is
not
possible
successfully
--
to
successfully
sell
market
and
distribute
gas
equipment
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
on
page
7,
sir?
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
oh,
“by
refusing
to
provide
gas
for
use
in
the
plaintiff's
radiant
burner
and
other
gas
heating
devices
and
equipment
produced
by
other
manufacturers
which
are
not
approved
by
aga.”
well,
i
say
again
that
any
gas
supplier,
any
utility
who
rejects
any
consumers'
application
for
gas
service
has
a
real
grievance
which
will
be
heard
by
the
public
service
commission.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
the
only
agreements
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
there
is
no
agreement
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
--
i
think
that
those
are
all
results
that
they
claim,
flow
from
the
use
of
the
aga
practice
in
testing
equipment
and
granting
it
seal
of
approval.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
mr.
--
that's
impossible,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
perhaps
not.
perhaps
not,
if
that
were
charged.
i
do
not
read
this
complaint
as
so
charging.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
it
must
have
been,
sir,
because
my
plan
does
nothing
but
constitute
itself
as
a
membership
corporation
and
the
activities
that
it
carries
on
are
the
operational
laboratories
made
into
the
tests,
those
that
passed
the
test
given
the
seal
of
approval.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
and
that's
--
it's
on
here.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
can
give
you
that,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
there
isn't
anything
showing
that
aga
itself,
of
course,
has
any
relations
whatever
with
gas
service.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
i
think
that
would
be
bad.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
but
--
but
this
is
tied
up
if
--
you
mean
by
an
aga
approved
burner?
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
i
think
that
the
essence
of
that
is
that
the
approval
act.
now,
our
approvals
are
on
the
allegations
here,
granted
where
the
material
is
of
metal.
they
are
not
granted
where
it
is
a
ceramic.
now,
those
are
the
facts.
and
on
--
in
the
basis
of
those
facts,
if
they
have
--
or
met
with
refusal
from
the
utility
company,
that
is
a
matter
which
i
think
is
not
actionable
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
that's
what
the
utilities
themselves
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
--
say
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
i
think
that
probably
would
be,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
that
may
well
be.
it
may
well
be
but
it's
a
--
a
conclusion,
it's
an
argument
that
all
tied
in
with
because
they're
not
approved
by
aga.
that
now
--
that
can't
be
overlooked
in
this
complaint.
and
i
say
that
our
approval
by
aga
is
not
based
on
any
discriminatory
practice.
it's
not
based
on
any
charges
that
the
standards
are
not
honestly
arrived
at.
i
think
that
the
remainder
on
some
of
those
questions,
your
honor,
could
perhaps
be
more
effective
(inaudible)
my
colleague
who
will
take
on
from
here,
sir.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
all
i
can
tell
you,
your
honor,
of
course,
is
that
the
--
i
can
only
bound
by
the
--
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
it
says
in
paragraph
(4)
on
page
4,
"members
of
the
combination
conspiracy,"
saying
first
we're
a
--
our
membership
corporation,
it
is
the
defendant
aga
around
which
the
illegal
conspiracy
in
combination
herein
alleged
revolves.
it
consists
of
a
combination
of
members
as
follows,
practically
all
if
not
all
of
the
public
utility
corporations
or
companies
including
defendants,
peoples
gas
and
other
utilities
mentioned
therein,
hundreds
of
manufacturers,
pipeline
companies,
thousands
of
individuals
who
carry
out
the
purposes
of
aga.
it
is
a
large
organization.
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
yes,
we
concede
that
there
are
large
categories
--
many
categories
having
large
membership.
that's
true.
that's
quite
true,
sir.
therefore,
if
there's
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
well,
the
exact
number
isn't
given
but
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
--
but
manufacturers.
yes,
sir.
manufacturers
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
--
are
members
of
aga,
and
they
are
represented
on
the
committee,
as
i've
pointed
out
from
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
horace
r.
lamb
they
manufacture
and
sell
metal
burners.
that's
right,
sir.
