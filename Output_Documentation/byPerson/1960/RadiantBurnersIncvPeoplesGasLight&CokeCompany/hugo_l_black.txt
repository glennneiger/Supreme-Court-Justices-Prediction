justice

black
who
is
the
american
gas
association?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
make
radiant
burners?
your
company
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
who
makes
the
metal
burners?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
the
utilities
--
not
the
utilities
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
charge
is
then
that
the
utilities
have
combined
and
conspired
with
the
makers
of
metal
burners
to
put
your
people
out
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
was
no
answer
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
dismissed
for
failure
to
allege
something
it
could
--
should've
been
alleged
in
a
good
pleading
or
did
they
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
you
didn't
have
any
good
cause
of
action,
you
couldn't
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it
--
what
i'm
getting
at
is
because
it
makes
some
difference
to
my
approach
to
the
case?
have
they
acted,
either
one
of
them,
on
the
basis
that
demurrers
have
said
you
don't
allege
so
and
so
and
therefore,
you
don't
have
a
good
case
or
have
they
just
sustained
a
general
demurrer
or
dismissal,
whatever
it
is,
on
the
grounds
that
you
just
don't
have
a
cause
of
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
did
they
give
you
any
time
to
amend
or
did
they
just
dismiss?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
last
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
considered
that
you
had
alleged
enough,
that
you
didn't
have
to
allege
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
weston,
there
hadn't
been
any
explanation
yet
of
precisely
of
what
a
burner
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
maybe
we
can
get
back
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
know
just
how
much
of
the
gas
requirement
is
involved?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
--
which
part
has
to
be
metal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
case
that
indicates
that
any
law
as
against
the
burners,
whatever
they
are,
are
being
used
anywhere
in
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
that
is
crucial
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
as
i
understand,
what
they're
complaining
of
is
that
a
group
of
businessmen
have
gotten
together
to
regulate
the
types
of
burners
that
can
be
used.
and
that
they
are
doing
that
so
as
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
these
people
to
trade
free
from
regulation
by
private
business
groups.
and
i
--
it
seems
to
me
like
they've
charged
something
as
though
you
are
operating
under
the
old
nlra.what's
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
all
the
charge.
it
could
be
one
thing
but
as
i
understand
it,
their
charge
do
not
only
do
that
but
you
do
it
in
combination
and
agreement
and
conspiracy
with
a
group
of
people
who
sell
the
metals,
do
not
mark
the
other
sellers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
--
but
the
fact
is
that
aga
doesn't
excuse
it
from
the
--
the
sherman
act
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
your
numbers
do
what
they
say
they've
done
here.
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
could
they
operate
if
their
--
their
complaint
is
--
is
stating
the
facts?
how
is
it
possible
for
them
to
sell
any
of
their
burners?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
their
complaint
indicates
that
they
can't
sell
it.
those
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
they
overstated
it
but
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
question
for
the
court,
isn't
it,
on
the
determination
of
facts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
thought
we
held
in
klor's
and
following
numerous
other
cases
that
the
combination
of
business
can
get
together
to
regulate,
has
something
to
be
sold
even
though
they
only
affect
one
trader
that
that
charges
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
we
--
can
we
use
the
words
per
se?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
it's
by
agreement,
do
you
think
that
the
sherman
act
could
destroy
if
people
who
engage
in
the
subject
of
public
utility
regulation
if
they
then
engage
with
others
on
a
conspiracy
or
agreement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
handicapped
trade?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
charged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
means
by
which
the
--
one
of
the
means
by
which
they
say
purpose
is
accomplished
to
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
sell
this
type
of
burner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let's
suppose
that
--
that
they
can
sell
not
a
--
it
only
destroys
99%
of
their
market,
not
only
50%.
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
think
that
made
any
difference
as
to
the
validity
of
the
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
people
who
sell
the
gas
burners.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
sell
metal
burners.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
--
[laughter]
what
do
you
think
the
real
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
holding
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
say
that
it
kept
--
charged
that
of
proving
if
they
--
if
they
charged
that
a
large
group
of
businessmen
and
the
commodity
that's
dealt
with
all
over
the
nation,
block
certain
types
of
that
business
from
entering
into
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce.
how
--
what
would
you
say
it's
necessary
for
them
to
show
an
addition
to
that
to
show
that
the
public
is
injured?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
precisely
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
klor
case.
and
the
court
below
held
that
the
acquired
public
injury
was
missing
because
there
was
no
charge
or
proof.
that
by
any
act
of
defendants,
the
price,
quality
or
quality
--
quantity
offered
to
public
was
affected,
nor
that
there
was
any
intent
or
purpose
to
affect
to
change
in
or
an
influence
on
prices,
quantity
or
quality.
and
we
held
that
they
didn't
have
to
show
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
charge
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
any
different
to
charging
an
agreement
among
the
people
that
they
will
keep
somebody
from
competing
in
the
--
in
the
area?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that
distinction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you
to
say
that
if
a
group
of
people
agreed
that
they
will
not
compete,
that's
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
same
people
agreed
that
they're
going
to
block
somebody
else
from
competing,
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
charge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
charge
is
that,
as
i
read
it,
if
there's
an
agreement
to
keep
people
to
manufacture
this
kind
of
burner
from
being
able
to
compete
in
the
market,
do
you
--
do
you
think
that's
not
enough
to
charge
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
in
other
words
that
the
agreement
of
a
group
of
people
where
they
leave
themselves
free
to
compete
with
one
another
but
agree
to
knock
other
people
out
from
competing
with
them
does
not
violate
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i'm
interested
in
that
because
we
had
to
meet
the
argument
that
only
one
man,
klor,
was
knocked
out
of
the
market,
only
one
man,
and
i
thought
we
answered
that
in
the
opinion
saying
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
if
it
was
just
one
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
then
you
are
not
to
arguing
on
the
basis
that
this
has
effect
on
one
man.
you're
arguing
it
on
your
division.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
taking
your
argument
in
--
in
effect
if
this
complaint
alleges,
they've
agreed
not
to
compete
with
ceramic
burners
by
agreeing
among
themselves
that
they
are
people
off
the
market.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
all
the
gasoline
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
all
the
gasoline
companies
on
the
contrary
will
get
together
to
the
people
who
sold
automobiles
all
but
one
automobile
and
agreed
that
they
would
not
supply
gas
to
anybody
except
the
people
who
ride
an
approved
car,
then
they
refused
to
approve
one
car,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
just
that.
just
that,
they
just
agree
among
themselves,
they're
going
to
approve
cars
that
use
their
--
all
gas
and
they
approve
all
of
them
but
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
they
won't
sell
any
gas
to
that
car.
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
that
they
are
keeping
the
ceramic
off
the
market
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
no,
just
what
you
charge
here
that
they've
gotten
together
and
by
a
system
of
--
that
makes
testing
an
approval.
they've
decided
that
they
will
not
sell
gasoline
to
any
cars
if
they
don't
approve.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there's
just
one
car
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
no.
i'm
stating
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
stating
precisely
the
case
you
have
except
i'm
using
gasoline
--
oil
--
gasoline
company
instead
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
an
agreement
among
all
of
them
that
there
will
not
be
any
gasoline
--
cannot
be
any
gasoline
sold.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
and
they
conspire
among
themselves
in
such
a
way
that
they
can
keep,
they
can
keep
as
they
can
here
into
sales
being
made
of
those
automobiles
because
they
can't
get
--
get
it
approved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
--
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
gasoline
companies
had
been
the
klor's
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
not
the
klor's
case
if
it's
the
--
if
it's
the
gas
company.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
same
setup
--
the
same
state
of
facts
that
you
have
here
with
reference
to
the
reason
the
man
can't
dispose
of
his
ceramic
burners.
he
can't
buy
one
because
he
can't
get
any
gas
for
it.
that's
the
charge
of
the
complaint.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
not
unless
you
agreed
with
them
and
conspired
with
them
to
see
that
they
didn't
do
it
and
helped
them
work
it
out
so
as
they
didn't
have
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
let's
suppose
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
let's
suppose
that's
true
but
it
may
not
be.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
that's
the
best
of
that
kind
of
burner.
well,
let's
suppose
it
is
superior,
it's
a
much
better
burner
than
the
others.
sell
to
the
public
and
save
them
a
lot
of
money
if
they
could
buy
and
that
there
is
such
an
agreement
as
is
claimed
here
to
keep
them
from
selling.
would
you
say
that
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
to
engage
in
such
an
agreement
to
stop
such
a
superior
burner
from
entering
into
the
market?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unlikely
to
be
one
if
what
they
allege
is
true,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
there
be?
what
good
would
it
do
if
they
were
75%
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
depends,
under
your
argument,
that
depends
on
the
decision
of
all
these
aggregation
of
companies
instead
of
only
traders
who
want
to
buy
it
for
themselves.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
did
pretty
well.
i'm
speaking
personally
for
you.
[laughter]
