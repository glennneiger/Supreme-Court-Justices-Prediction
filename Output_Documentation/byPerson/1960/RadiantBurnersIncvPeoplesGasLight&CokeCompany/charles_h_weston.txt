mr.
charles
h.
weston
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
interest
of
the
government
in
this
case
is
with
the
holding
that
the
complaint
did
not
state
a
cause
of
action
because
it
did
not
show
injury
to
the
general
public.
on
the
particular
facts
here,
this
means
that
a
powerful
group
can
combine
to
keep
a
product
off
the
market
and
yet
have
no
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
and
they
said
they've
shown
that
the
total
volume
of
sales
the
public
has
been
induced
or
that
the
excluded
product
is
a
superior
product.
i
believe
that
this
is
not
the
law.
at
the
1956
term
in
radovich,
the
court
held
there
could
be
error
to
dismiss
a
complaint
for
failure
to
allege
public
injury.
and
of
course,
at
the
1958
term,
it
held
that
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
keep
a
retail
store
from
obtaining
goods
of
certain
leading
manufactures,
this
was
a
restraint
of
such
monopolistic
tendency
that
it
came
within
the
prohibitions
of
the
act,
and
that
it
was
immaterial
that
was
no
charge
or
proof
that
it
was
in
effect
on
the
quantity,
or
quality,
or
price
of
goods
sold
to
the
public.
in
the
fashion
originators'
guild
case
in
312
u.s.,
an
agreement
to
keep
from
out
of
trade,
garments
which
embody
pirated
original
designs
was
held
to
violate
the
act,
not
withstanding,
no
showing
that
this
conspiracy
regulated
prices
or
that
it
allocated
or
limited
production
have
brought
about
a
deterioration
in
the
quality
of
goods.
the
court
said
that
these
categories
did
not
exhaust
the
types
of
conduct
then
by
the
sherman
act.
the
court
below
said
that
this
--
that
klor's
and
fashion
originators'
guild
involve
per
se
--
restraints
per
se
illegal.
and
that
they
eliminated
the
necessity
of
showing
public
injury
only
as
to
such
restraints.
in
these
cases,
the
court
did
not
attach
the
label
per
se
to
the
restraints
which
it
held
unlawful.
my
view
of
the
decisions
is
that
the
court
regarded
them
as
involving
restraints
of
--
restraints
on
competition
of
a
degree
in
character
that
made
them
unreasonable
irrespective
of
whether
they
fell
within
the
classification
of
per
se
restraints.
and
that,
if
this
is
true,
these
are
holdings
that
public
injury
does
not
--
is
not
an
essential
element
in
a
complaint
or
in
the
proof
of
a
restraint
which
is
not
per
se
unreasonable
but
whether
this
maybe
debatable
whether
the
decision
below
is
in
conflict
with
the
actual
holdings
in
fashion
originators'
and
klor's.
but
the
conflict
with
radovich
seems
to
me
certain.
there,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
allege
public
injury
and
it
treated
the
restraint
as
being
not
per
se
illegal.
it
said
that
it
need
be
treated
only
under
the
general
prohibition
--
under
the
sherman
act's
general
prohibition
on
unreasonable
restraints
of
trade.
it
cited
for
this
general
prohibition
the
times-picayune
case
where
the
restraint
was
not
per
se
illegal,
it
was
in
fact
held
legal.
the
court
in
radovich
said,
“congress
has
by
legislative
fiat
determined
that
such
prohibited
activities
are
injurious
to
the
public.”
in
other
words,
that
any
restraint
that
comes
within
the
act's
prohibitions
does
involve
detriment
to
the
public.
the
very
fact
the
prohibition
establishes
the
view
that
congress
regarded
that
as
against
public
interest.
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
in
addition
to
violation
that
the
defendant's
particular
violation
has
defeated
the
ultimate
public
objectives
of
the
statute,
ultimate
ends
that
the
statute
was
designed
to
serve.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
of
course,
there
is
the
--
certain
specific,
very
precise
prohibitions
in
the
clayton
act
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
and
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
there
is
a
specific
element
there,
yes.
now,
the
decision
below
in
this
case,
a
decision
by
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
of
ritz
(ph)
case
which
our
brief
cites.
and
i
think
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
klor's
case
show
that
lower
federal
courts
still
believe
that
public
injury
must
be
shown
in
every
section
1,
sherman
act
proceeding
not
involving
restraint
per
se
illegal.
i
believe
the
lower
courts
will
continue
to
enforce
this
requirement
because
it
provides
an
easy
doctrine
of
a
basis
for
disposing
of
sherman
act
cases
which
otherwise
might
require
careful
analysis
of
the
facts
in
relation
to
--
to
decide
the
cases.
and
only
a
decision
by
this
court
which
explicitly
holds
that
public
injury
does
not
have
to
be
shown,
whether
the
restraint
is
per
se
illegal
or
not
by
putting
in
to
dismissal
of
sherman
act
cases
from
the
basis
of
lack
of
showing
of
public
injury.
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case
would
seem
to
indicate
that
it
was
regarded
as
presenting
a
question
of
federal
law
of
general
importance.
there
would
be
no
such
question
decided
if
this
court
merely
holds
that
the
allocations
in
fact
show
a
restraint
per
se
illegal
or
that
they
sufficiently
allege
public
injury
or
that
in
a
sherman
act
proceeding,
it's
enough
merely
to
allege
that
the
restraint
is
unreasonable
or
to
the
injury
of
the
public.
the
necessity
of
showing
public
injury
is
presented
here
as
a
pleading
question.
but
the
much
more
important
and
underlying
question
is
one
of
substantive
law,
that
is,
the
elements
which
is
essential
to
show
to
establish
that
restraint
not
per
se
illegal
is
in
violation
of
the
act.
this
is
so
because
whatever
it
is
necessary
to
allege,
it
is
necessary
to
prove.
the
brief
of
parmelee
transportation
company
illustrates
this.
the
complaint
which
it
filed
charged
a
conspiracy
to
exclude
it
from
performing
certain
transportation
service.
the
district
court
on
the
authority
of
the
radiant
burners
decision
in
the
court
below
required,
ordered
preliminary
separate
trial
of
the
question
whether
this
conspiracy
injured
the
general
public.
and
it
put
the
plaintiff
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
proof
that
because
of
the
conspiracy,
the
service
to
the
public
had
been
appreciably
lessened
or
it
had
been
deprived
as
superior
service.
under
the
concept
of
substantive
law
of
the
court
below,
present
petitioner
if
it
ever
--
if
the
case
--
when
the
case
came
to
trial,
would
have
an
impossible
burden
of
proof.
assume
that
this
conspiracy
to
keep
off
the
market
every
burner
that
does
not
have
the
association
seal
of
approval
is
a
100%
successful.
public
has
been
able
to
buy
all
the
burners
if
it
wished
to
buy.
how
can
it
be
shown
that
the
conspiracy
has
lessened,
appreciably
lessened
the
sale
of
burners?
how
can
it
be
shown
that
it
has
been
deprived
of
a
product
of
overall
superiority?
perhaps
superiority
means
superiority
regardless
of
price.
perhaps
it
means
superior
value
per
dollar
of
purchase
price
or
perhaps
it
means
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
that
his
burner
is
superior
to
each
and
every
one
of
the
burners
available
to
the
public.
in
any
event,
it
has
to
be
court
and
jury
determination
of
technical,
mechanical
engineering
questions
probably
presented
on
conflicting
expert
opinion
testimony.
there'll
be
an
injection
of
another
issue
in
antitrust
proceedings
which
--
as
the
court
knows
unfortunately,
frequently
are
very
long
and
protracted
as
well
as
expensive.
now,
except
for
the
ritz
(ph)
case
which
was
decided
last
year,
this
doctrine
of
--
required
a
showing
that
public
injury
has
been
applied
only
in
private
actions.
if
this
is
requisite
in
private
actions,
it
is
requisite
in
--
probably
in
sherman
act
proceedings.
violation
of
the
statute
is
the
basis
of
suit
in
either
type
of
proceeding.
and
the
elements
necessary
to
show
violation
have
to
be
the
same.
yet,
there
have
been
a
great
number
of
government
cases
involving
restraints
which
the
court
did
not
treat
as
per
se
illegal,
which
have
been
held
unlawful
without
any
discussion
of
the
question
whether
it
has
been
a
showing
of
the
kind
of
public
injury
referred
to
by
the
court
below,
without
any
discussion
of
whether
such
a
showing
is
necessary.
this
is
the
body
of
law
which
at
least
sub
silentio,
indicates
that
this
is
not
a
required
element
in
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
showing
a
violation
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
sub
silentio.
at
least
sub
silentio.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
not
--
not
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
not
in
those
terms.
that
is
--
that
certainly
is
true.
it
might
be
that
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
it
might
be
that
there
would
be
allegations
from
that
in
some
--
in
many
instances
from
which
perhaps
--
because
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
--
well
a
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes.
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
that
is
true.
i
just
want
to
be
cautious
since
and
say
that
there
might
be
allegations
from
which
you
would
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
in
some
instances
to
be
impossible
to
infer.
now,
this
requirement
of
public
injury
has
--
gets
no
support
from
the
words
of
the
statute.
that
contention
isn't
even
made.
respondent's
argument
went
something
like
this,
as
i
understand
it.
under
the
so
called
rule
of
reason
which
the
court
first
adopted
in
standard
oil
case
in
221
u.s.,
the
act
makes
unlawful
on
the
restraints
which
are
unduly
or
unreasonably
restrictive
of
competition
or
tending
to
monopoly.
and
some
types
of
restraints
are
so
destructive
of
competition
and
conducive
to
monopoly
but
their
very
nature
in
character,
that
they
are
deemed
unreasonable
under
any
--
all
circumstances.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
think
it
goes
to
the
latter.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
no,
that
it
--
that
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
yes,
yes.
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
my
reading
of
it,
certainly.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
it
--
if
it's
merely
a
pleading
question,
i
suppose
plaintiffs
can
per
se
pleadings
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
meet
the
requirements.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i'm
afraid
i
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
no,
i
can't.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
i
can't
tell.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
now
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
have
to
imagine
--
the
respondent's
counsel
would
perhaps
be
able
to
answer
that
question,
i
cannot.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
oh,
yes.
that
they
have
--
that
--
that
they
have
advocated
and
brought
about
--
brought
from
the
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
(inaudible)
intentions.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that's
right.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
that
is
with
one
of
numerous
elements
charged.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
h.
weston
there
have
been
cases.
for
instance,
the
borden
case
in
this
court
where
a
--
a
government
case
where
the
united
states
charged,
that
is
a
part
of
a
conspiracy
to
fix
prices,
city
officials
had
--
were
participants
in
the
conspiracy.
mr.
charles
h.
weston
well,
i
don't
think
that
i
should
undertake
to
--
mr.
charles
h.
weston
--
to
[laughs]
deal
with
this
question
because
i
think
counsel
for
the
petitioner
is
more
confident
that
i
am
and
--
certainly
in
that
area.
now,
the
respondents
urge
that
where
a
restraint
is
not
per
se
illegal,
then
in
order
to
show
that
it
comes
within
the
statute,
you
have
to
show
that
it
has
certain
adverse
effects
on
the
public.
and
they
mentioned
statements
made
by
this
court
from
time
to
time
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
or
one
of
the
purposes
was
to
protect
the
public
against
--
and
has
been
of
prices
curtailing
production,
deterioration
of
quality
goods.
they
say
that
this
requirement
of
showing
of
public
injury
is
a
verbalization
or
a
reformulation
of
rule
of
reason.
i
submit
that
this
contention
is
an
error
because
it
dissimilates
the
benefits
to
the
public
thought
to
--
and
so
by
and
large
in
the
long
run
by
prohibiting
anti-competitive
and
monopolistic
combinations
that
the
prohibitions
themselves
attest
the
application
and
scope
of
these
prohibitions
as
the
effect
on
competition
of
the
acts
which
is
charged.
this
is
the
very
meaning
of
the
words
“restraint
of
trade”.
test
is
not
whether
the
act's
directly
and
immediately
and
demonstrably
produce
these
effects
on
the
public
which
the
statute
have
the
general
purpose
of
preventing.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
the
touchstone
to
the
unreasonableness
of
a
restraint
of
trade
to
the
extent
to
which
--
in
the
manner
in
which
it
affected
competition.
the
chicago
board
of
trade
case
in
246
u.s.
is
referred
to
press
more
frequently
than
any
other
by
antitrust
defendants
who
assert
that
the
restraints
of
which
they
are
charged
are
reasonable.
the
court
in
that
case
as
in
other
cases
made
the
effect
on
competition,
the
key
to
the
scope
of
what
was
prohibited.
court
said
at
page
238,
“the
true
test
of
legality
is
whether
the
restraint
imposed
is
such
as
merely
regulates
and
perhaps
thereby
promotes
competition
or
whether
it
is
such
as
may
suppress
or
even
destroy
competition.”
in
the
recent
northern
pacific
case,
the
court
said
that
the
sherman
act
was
designed,
reserved,
free
and
unfettered
competition
as
the
law
of
trade.”
it
said
that
the
act
rests
on
the
premise
that
the
free-play
of
competitive
forces
would
yield
the
best
allocation
of
our
economic
resources,
the
lowest
prices,
the
highest
quality
and
the
greatest
material
progress.
plainly,
an
antitrust
plaintiff
does
not
have
to
prove
what
is
incapable
of
proof
that
the
defendants'
acts
have
interfered
with
or
prevented
the
best
allocation
of
the
nation's
economic
resources
or
the
greatest
material
progress.
all
that
need
be
shown
is
that
the
restraint
significantly
interferes
with
the
free
interaction
of
competitive
forces.
i'll
mention
just
one
other
consideration.
price
enhancement
is
a
public
evil
most
commonly
and
most
directly
considered
to
be
the
--
to
result
from
anti-competitive
and
monos
--
monopolistic
combinations.
and
price-fixing
agreements
are
unlawful
per
se,
but
regardless
of
whether
they
enhance
price.
the
prohibited
agreements
include
those
to
fix
price
ceilings
and
it
is
irrelevant
in
the
case
of
these
agreements.
what
the
actual
effect
on
price
was,
that
was
the
holding
first
in
trenton
potteries
and
in
great
number
of
following
cases.
the
agreements
are
outlawed
per
se
because
they
strike
at
the
very
core
of
commercial
competition,
that
is
price
competition.
the
determining
consideration
is
not
effect
on
the
public
but
the
effect
on
competition.
thank
you.
