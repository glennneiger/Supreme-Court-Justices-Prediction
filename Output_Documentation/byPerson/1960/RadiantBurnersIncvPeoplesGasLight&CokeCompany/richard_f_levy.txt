mr.
richard
f.
levy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
pleadings
to
review
dismissal
of
petitioner's
complaint
by
the
district
court
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
and
the
affirmance
of
that
dismissal
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
petitioner
seeks
in
this
action
to
recover
treble
damages
and
to
obtain
injunctive
relief
against
respondents
from
respondents
by
virtue
of
their
alleged
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
the
petitioner
is
a
small
manufacturer
of
ceramic
gas
burners
which
are
used
in
the
space
heating
of
homes
and
industrial
and
commercial
facilities.
the
complaint
charges
that
petitioner
has
been
prevented
from
selling
its
product
in
interstate
commerce
by
a
horizontal
and
vertical
conspiracy
consisting
of
the
respondent,
american
gas
association
or
aga
and
its
members.
now,
the
membership
of
this
trade
association,
the
aga,
includes
hundreds
of
petitioner's
direct
competitors,
that
is,
manufacturers
of
competing
gas
burners.
it
includes
gas
pipeline
companies
and
it
includes
all
or
practically
all
of
the
gas
public
utilities
in
the
united
states.
according
to
the
complaint,
petitioner
has
been
excluded
from
the
market
by
a
device
called
the
aga
approval
plan
and
the
aga
seal
of
approval.
it
works
like
this.
a
committee
of
the
aga
which
includes
among
its
membership
petitioner's
competitors
has
established
standards
for
the
granting
or
denial
of
this
aga
seal
of
approval.
all
of
the
competitors
who
sit
on
this
committee
make
burners
of
metal.
the
standards
which
they
have
established
require
that
only
metal
burners
may
be
approved.
the
petitioner's
burner
has
twice
been
submitted
to
the
aga,
twice,
the
aga
has
rejected
it.
now,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
standards
which
this
committee
establishes
are
not
objective
standards.
and
this
is,
of
course,
admitted
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
by
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss
and
in
any
event,
the
respondent,
aga,
argues
in
its
brief
before
this
court
that
the
standards
need
not
be
objective
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
argue
that
the
standards
need
not
even
be
valid
standards.
this
denial
of
the
seal
of
approval
to
petitioner's
burner
is
only
the
horizontal
aspect
of
this
conspiracy
which
we
have
charged.
after
the
seal
of
approval
was
denied
to
petitioner,
the
vertical
component
was
brought
into
play.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
it
means
that
they
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
i
mean
that
they
are
subjective.
we
mean
that
these
competitors
who
sit
on
the
committee
can
impose
and
do
impose
any
standards
which
suit
their
purpose
that
their
seal
is
purportedly
granted
to
a
product
which
is
fit
to
be
marketed,
that
in
fact,
the
standards
they
have
established
have
no
relation
to
this
at
all.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
they
are
arbitrary
standards,
that
they
are
capricious
standards.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
exactly.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
our
burner
is
a
ceramic
burner
that
is
to
say
the
gas
instead
of
coming
out
of
a
--
a
metal
port
much
like
a
standard
gas
stove,
comes
out
of
ceramic
ports.
it
crosses
and
heats
other
ceramic
bars
or
radiants
as
they
are
called.
and
the
--
the
unique
principle
involved
in
this
burner
is
that
the
ceramic
radiant
is
superheated
and
instead
of
the
normal
rising
heat
or
convected
heat,
which
you
get
in
the
aga
burners,
you
get
a
radiant
heat
which
goes
in
every
direction
and
which
the
complaint
alleges
is
a
safer
burner
and
a
burner
which
is
twice
as
efficient
in
the
use
of
gas.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
is
what
i
mean.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
yes.
indeed,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
on
page
13
of
the
record
in
the
first
indented
paragraph
reading
from
the
complaint,
“all
gas
burners
approved
by
aga
are
metal,”
and
skipping
to
the
next
paragraph,
“the
radiant
burner
is
made
of
ceramic
radiants.”
and
i
--
i
might
point
out
also
that
the
aga,
in
their
brief,
has
indicated
that
their
denial
of
the
seal
was
not
improper
because
their
standards
are
metal
and
the
radiant
burner
is
ceramic.
that's
at
page
14
of
the
brief
submitted
by
the
respondent
aga.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
we
allege,
in
fact,
your
honor,
that
ours
is
a
safer
burner
that
because
of
a
unique
application
of
the
gas,
the
way
it's
introduced,
that
the
radiant
burner
cannot
explode
that,
in
fact,
burners
approved
by
the
aga
do
explode.
we
allege
that
it
is
at
least
as
durable
and
perhaps
more
durable
than
the
aga
burners.
and
we
allege
that
it
uses
half
as
much
gas
to
heat
the
same
space
under
the
same
conditions
because
of
this
radiant
principle.
now,
the
public
is
not
given
the
choice
by
the
respondents
of
accepting
or
rejecting
this
non-approved
burner.
they
do
not
stop
with
simply
granting
or
denying
the
seal
of
approval.
they
have
used
--
and
this
is
what
i've
referred
to
as
the
vertical
aspect
of
the
conspiracy,
they've
used
the
strength
of
the
gas
companies'
monopolies
to
make
sure
that
petitioner
cannot
get
to
the
market
with
its
product.
they've
created
an
image
for
this
seal
of
approval
by
using
the
aga,
which
is
allegedly
a
non-profit
organization,
to
state
to
the
public
that
we
think
that
the
aga
products
are
good
and
the
radiant
burners
are
bad.
in
fact,
we
think
they
have
created
here
a
license
to
compete.
and
without
this
license,
we
cannot
enter
the
market.
now,
this
is
the
way
that
the
gas
companies
have
done
it.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
we
think
that
the
complaint
certainly
contains
that
allegation.
now
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
it
does
not
--
it
does
not
state
that
they
were
discriminatorily
applied
in
the
case
of
the
two
tests
that
were
given
to
the
radiant
burner.
it
does
state,
on
the
other
hand,
and
i'm
now
looking
at
page
6
of
the
record,
at
the
bottom
in
subparagraph
(a),
these
tests
made
by
the
aga
are
not
based
on
valid
and
bearing
objective
standards,
and
aga
can
make
an
arbitrarily,
and
capriciously
does
make
determinations
in
respect
of
whether
a
given
gas
burner
has
passed
its
tests.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
there
is
no
specific
allegation
that
the
two
tests
applied
to
our
burners
were
arbitrarily
--
were
--
were
arbitrarily
applied.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
they
could
do
so,
that
they
sometimes
do
and
that
it
is
petitioner's
competitors
who
sit
on
this
committee
which
has
the
final
word,
not
only
as
to
standards
which
automatically
exclude
the
ceramic
burner,
but
whether,
in
a
particular
instance,
the
seal
of
approval
will
be
granted
or
will
not
be
granted.
so
these
gas
companies
have
discouraged
their
customers
from
purchasing
the
radiant
burner
or
in
fact
any
non-approved
burner.
they
have
opened
their
--
their
public
showroom
space
for
exhibition
of
the
products
of
their
co-conspirators,
the
members
of
the
aga.
they've
closed
this
public
showroom
space
to
petitioner's
product
and
to
all
other
non-approved
products.
they
have
coerced
dealers
not
to
handle
the
radiant
burner.
and
when
a
dealer
has
done
so,
he
has
been
disciplined
by
the
gas
companies
by
a
threatened
or
in
some
cases,
an
actual
withdrawal
of
the
dealer's
certificate
as
competent
and
trustworthy
in
the
installation
of
gas
equipment.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
the
gas
public
utilities,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
have
followed
a
practice
of
giving
a
certificate
to
those
gas
burner
dealers
in
their
--
in
their
communities
who
they
think
are
competent
and
trustworthy.
the
practice
is
that
if
a
potential
customer
comes
to
the
gas
company
and
says,
“what
kind
of
gas
burner
do
you
recommend?”
they
say
to
them,
“here
is
our
list
of
competent
and
trustworthy
dealers.”
and
this
listing,
as
a
competent
and
trustworthy
dealer,
has
been
important
to
dealers
because
a
good
deal
of
business
comes
to
the
dealers
through
the
gas
company.
now,
this
is
particularly
true
in
illinois
because
in
illinois,
there
are
over,
to
this
date,
there
are
over
200,000
persons
waiting
for
a
permit
from
the
gas
company
to
install
gas
space
heating.
so
the
gas
company,
which
issues
a
permit
to
install
gas
space
heating,
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
customer
at
the
time
that
the
customer
is
ready
to
buy
a
gas
burner.
and
he's
in
direct
contact
with
this
certificate.
and
so
he
is
able
to
say,
“buy
an
aga
approved
product.
don't
buy
a
radiant
burner.
don't
buy
a
non-approved
burner.”
mr.
richard
f.
levy
we
do
allege
that.
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
was
the
next
point
which
i
was
going
to
discuss.on
page
7
of
the
record
in
paragraph
d1,
“we
allege
that
gas
companies
refused
to
provide
gas
for
use
in
plaintiff's
radiant
burner
and
other
gas
heating
devices
and
equipment
produced
by
other
manufacturers
which
are
not
approved
by
the
aga."
in
other
words,
if
--
if
their
persuasion
doesn't
work
and
if
their
coercion
on
the
dealers
though,
it
doesn't
work,
then
they
have,
what
i
suppose
you
could
only
call
an
absolute
weapon.
they
have
said,
“you
can't
have
gas
for
use
in
this
radiant
burner.”
and
as
good
a
product
as
we
think
this
--
this
burner
is
and
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
it's
obvious
that
you
can't
sell
a
burner
if
the
gas
companies,
who
were
monopolies
in
the
communities
they
serve,
say,
“we
won't
supply
gas.”
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
they
have
done
it.
it
is
true
that
utilities
are
required
by
local
law
to
serve
the
public
in
a
non-discriminatory
manner.
it
is
also
true
that
a
gas
company
if
it
was
acting
individually,
might
well
say,
“we
don't
think
that
this
gas
burner
is
safe
and
so
we
won't
install
it.”
and
i
think
that
would
not
violate
the
law.
but
--
but
the
impact
of
our
allegation
here
is
a
conspiracy.
that
they
have
not
--
gas
companies
haven't
examined
the
radiant
burner.
the
gas
companies
haven't
said,
“this
burner
is
no
good.”
what
the
gas
companies
have
done
and
said,
“you
are
not
aga
approved,
you
can't
have
gas.”
and
this
approval,
of
course,
is
made
impart
by
our
competitors
who
are
part
of
the
same
overall
conspiracy.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
the
american
gas
association,
mr.
justice
black,
is
a
new
york
membership
corporation.
it
is
allegedly
a
non-profit
association
and
it
includes,
as
i
discussed,
the
competitors,
the
pipeline
companies
and
all
or
practically
all
of
the
gas
companies
in
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
our
company
makes
the
radiant
burner
and
it
is
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
the
metal
burners
are
made
the
hundreds
of
aga
members
who
compete
with
the
petitioner
with
the
radiant
burner.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
no,
sir.
the
utilities
do
not
sell
burners.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
or
i
would
actually
turn
it
around
and
i
would
say,
“that
our
competitors
who
horizontally
have
conspired
to
deny
the
seal
to
us
have
conspired
with
the
gas
companies
to
make
sure
that
the
denial
of
the
seal
effectively
prevents
us
from
getting
to
the
market.”
mr.
richard
f.
levy
the
complaint
contains
no
allegation
of
--
as
to
whether
we
are
or
we
are
not.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
aga
bylaws
would
make
or
would
--
would
admit
us.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
no
suggestion
in
the
complaint
that
we
were
excluded.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
yes.
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
simply
a
lack
of
pipeline
facilities
to
bring
the
--
this
is
all
natural
gas
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
--
which
comes
i
think
largely
from
texas
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
--
new
mexico
and
southern
california.
these
gas
companies
or
the
gas
pipeline
companies
are
in
the
process
of
adding
pipelines
undoubtedly
within
a
few
years,
this
backlog
will
be
gone.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
but
there
is
a
short
supply
of
gas
in
illinois.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
it's
my
impression
that
this
is
general
throughout
the
mid-west
area.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
now,
it
--
it
should
be
noted
that
there's
--
there's
no
secret
conspiracy
that
ties
this
horizontal
and
vertical
agreement
together.
the
--
the
aga
itself
has
characterized
their
approval
plan
as
their
theme
song.
and
they
have
published
a
brochure
which
they
had
sent
out
to
their
members
and
which
is
contained
in
our
complaint
at
page
8
of
the
record.
and
they
say,
“not
only
must
--
not
only
must
we
be
familiar
with
the
theme
song,
but
we
must
all
sing
it
in
tune
if
we
would
be
successful.”
and
there
are
additional
allegations
in
the
complaint
that
the
aga
has
urged,
and
this
at
page
9
of
the
record,
has
urged
all
of
its
members
to
work
as
a
unit
to
exclude
from
sale
and
use
any
gas
products
not
approved
by
the
aga.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
we
have
not
established
in
our
complaint
the
initial
date.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
mr.
lamb
tells
me
that
it
--
it
came
into
existence
in
1919.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
as
far
as
i
know
it
never
has.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
other
ceramic
manufacturers.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
we
are
the
only
ceramic
manufacturer.
this
is
a
patented
product.
the
ceramic
manufacturer,
according
to
the
complaint,
could
not
--
well,
he
might
be
a
member
of
the
aga,
he
could
not
get
aga
approval
for
the
reason
that
he
does
make
his
product
of
ceramic.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
said
that
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well,
it's
in
the
standards
which
are
printed
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
--
standards
as
i
would
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
--
as
i
understand.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
they
must
be
metal,
that
burners
which
are
not
made
of
metal
will
not
be
approved.
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
make
clear
that
this
committee
of
the
aga
which
includes
our
competitors
has
two
functions.
it
not
only
establishes
the
standards
but
in
a
given
case,
it
is
this
committee
which
says
that
the
seal
will
be
given
or
will
be
denied
as
they
did
twice
in
our
case.
the
seventh
circuit
said
there
was
no
cause
of
action
stated
by
these
allegations.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
the
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
before
this
court
that
would
indicate
they
gave
reasons.
now,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
only
reasons
they
have
given
are
contained
in
the
aga
brief
and
that
is
that
it
was
ceramic
and
that
it
was
not
metal.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
there
was
no
answer
filed,
mr.
justice
black.
this
does
come
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
filed
by
all
of
the
respondents.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well,
they
dismissed
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
dismissed
three
complaints.
the
complaint
that
we're
here
on
today
is
the
second
amended
complaint.
the
district
court
said
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
--
now,
i
--
i
know
i'm
not
being
directly
responsive
to
your
question
and
i'm
not
because
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
it,
that
is,
the
district
court
did
not
make
clear
whether
they
said
that
no
cause
of
action
ever
could
be
alleged
or
whether
they
said
that
we
have
left
something
out.
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
give
us
reasons
as
to
why
they
thought
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
stated
here.
what
they
said
was
this.
they
said,
“first
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
i
think
that
they
have
done
the
first,
mr.
justice
black,
that
is,
they
have
said,
“you
do
not
have
a
good
cause
of
action
because
the
certain
items
are
missing
from
your
allegations.”
and
those
items
that
the
court
of
appeals
says
are
missing
and
that
as
a
matter
fact,
the
district
court
too
said
were
missing,
were
these.
they
said
that
as
to
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act
that
there
was
no
per
se
violation
here
because
there
was
no
boycott.
and
they
took
their
definition
of
boycott
from
their
reading
of
the
klor's
case
from
the
fashion
originators'
guild
case.
they
read
those
cases
to
require
as
--
and
this
is
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
the
essential
basis
for
a
boycott,
a
direct
refusal
to
deal
between
parties
in
a
buyer
and
a
seller
relationship.
that
direct
refusal
element
being
absent
here,
the
court
of
appeals
summarily
in
one
paragraph
discarded
klor's,
discarded
fashion
originators'
and
said
there
was
no
per
se
violation
in
this
case.
next,
they
went
through
the
rule
of
reason.
and
here,
they
said
that
petitioner
had
not
stated
the
cause
of
action
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
not
even
open
to
petitioner
under
the
complaint
to
prove
the
unreasonableness
under
the
circumstances
because
there
is
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
aga
did
not
have
a
good
reason
for
denying
the
seal
of
approval,
in
other
words,
that
there
was
no
allegation
in
their
view
that
the
seal
was
denied
arbitrarily
and
capriciously.
and
this
--
this
was
the
extent
of
their
inquiry
under
the
rule
of
reason.finally,
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
no
cause
of
action
here
because
the
complaint
failed
to
allege
injury
to
the
public
in
the
form,
and
i
think
this
important,
in
the
form
of
an
appreciable
lessening
in
the
sale
of
conversion
gas
burners
or
that
the
public
has
been
deprived
of
a
product
of
overall
superiority.
in
other
words,
no
public
injury
because
we
didn't
say
that
our
product
was
not
merely
as
good
as
but
overall
superior
to
all
the
other
products
on
the
market,
and
we
didn't
have
a
cause
of
action
because
there
was
no
appreciable
lessening
in
the
sale
of
gas
burners.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
they
are
remedial
--
remediable,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
sense
that
we
could
allege
such
facts.
but
we
are
going
to
urge
today
and
the
united
states
has
joined
us
as
amicus
to
urge.
it
is
no
necessity.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well,
i
think
that's
right.
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say
that
you
can
never
state
a
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
act.
but
they
did
impose,
as
requirements
for
a
cause
of
action
under
the
sherman
act,
requirements
that
we
don't
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
the
proceedings
carried
over
about
two
years,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
on
the
last
proceeding,
that
is
the
district
court
dismissal
of
the
second
amended
complaint,
we
did
not
ask
for
time
to
amend.
in
other
words,
we
felt
that
it
was
now
time
to
go
to
a
higher
court
and
we
took
an
appeal
from
the
dismissal
of
the
second
amended
complain.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
now,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
overlooked
the
--
the
basic
question.
it's
not
even
discussed,
the
basic
question
which
faces
this
court
and
which
faces
any
court
in
a
sherman
act
case
and
that
is
what
the
effect
of
this
restraint
is
on
competition.
the
respondents
argue
that
only
petitioner
was
hurt,
that
competition
was
not
affected
at
all.
we
think
that
the
impact
of
this
restraint
goes
far
beyond
petitioner.
the
complaint
alleges
at
the
outset
that
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
is
to
control
the
manufacture,
sale,
use
and
installation
of
gas
burners,
gas
heating
devices
and
other
gas
equipment.
not
just
the
radiant
burner
but
anything
which
the
aga
does
not
like.
and
we
submit
that
this,
taken
in
connection
with
the
factual
allegations
which
i've
described
are
sufficient
so
that
this
court
should
conclusively
presume
that
if
these
facts
are
proven
to
be
true
at
the
trial,
competition
has
been
injured,
competition
has
been
destroyed
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
right.
in
other
words,
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
court
of
appeals
has
taken
this
position.
once
you
get
out
of
the
per
se
area,
you
must
not
only
prove
an
unreasonable
restraint
in
the
sense
of
injury
to
the
competitive
processes
but
you
must
prove
something
more.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
says
we
have
to
prove
is
an
appreciable
lessening
in
the
sale
of
gas
burners
or
that
the
public
has
been
deprived
of
a
product
of
overall
superiority.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
if
you
allege
price-fixing,
that's
enough.
if
you
allege
a
direct
refusal
to
deal,
that's
enough.
but
when
you
allege
that
the
gas
companies
refuse
to
deal
with
your
customers,
that's
not
enough.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
even
though
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
even
though
you
allege
conclusory
terms
and
factual
terms
that
as
a
result
of
this
restraint,
there's
no
more
competition
in
this
industry.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
it
--
it
could
be
phrased
that
way
and
i
--
if
they
phrased
it
that
way,
your
honor,
i
would
then
answer
it
by
saying
that
they
are
requiring
more
than
the
rule
of
reason
requires
that
has
an
adverse
effect
on
competition.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well,
they
did
say
--
they
did
use
the
word
“also”
when
they
got
through
with
the
rule
of
reason.
they
said,
“also
we
think
that
the
complaint
fails
to
state
a
cause
of
action
because,”
and
then
they
went
in
to
the
public
injury
discussion.
now,
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
economics,
as
a
matter
of
economic
principles,
it
must
be
recognized
that
you
cannot
have
effective
competition
unless
you
have
free
access
to
the
market
for
new
products.
and
we
suggest
that
this
requirement
of
the
aga
that
we
obtained
a
license
from
our
competitors
is
tantamount
to
a
denial
of
access
to
the
market.
as
far
as
the
public
injury
question
is
concerned,
we
certainly
joined
with
the
united
states
and
parmelee
transportation
as
amicus
in
this
case
in
urging
that
this
court's
rule
that
there's
no
requirement
that
a
plaintiff
prove
anything
except
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
the
competition.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
well
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
i
--
i
think
that
it's
not
now
here
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
before
this
case.
mr.
richard
f.
levy
nothing
in
the
allegations
to
indicate
that
the
aga
has
registered
its
trademark
under
the
lanham
act
but
--
mr.
richard
f.
levy
yes,
and
going
to
the
--
going
to
the
basic
question,
i
--
i
would
certainly
suggest
that
this
court
has
held
and
that
it's
clear
that
the
lanham
act
is
never
a
defense
to
an
antitrust
violation.
and
the
lanham
act
certainly
was
not
intended
by
converse
as
a
device
to
impose
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
and
i
am
speaking
of
attempt
in
(inaudible)
case
where
this
court
said
that.
thank
you.
