hubbard

mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
am
j.
hubbard
davis
of
norfolk,
virginia
representing
the
petitioner,
virginia
milanovich.
mike
milanovich
is
represented
by
mr.
bergan.
we
are
here
today
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
district
--
i
mean,
court
of
the
appeals
of
the
fourth
circuit.
we
are
appealing
on
the
grounds
that
she
was
erroneously
convicted.
virginia
milanovich
was
erroneously
convicted
of
both
stealing
and
having
possession
of
the
stolen
goods
and
also
that
the
court
erred,
in
failing
to
instruct
the
witnesses
not
to
discuss
their
testimony,
both
of
which,
for
prejudicial
and
harmful
error
to
the
petitioners.
briefly,
the
facts
are
that
in
june
2nd,
1958,
mike
and
virginia
milanovich,
husband
and
wife,
mike
being
a
chief
in
the
navy
of
some
18
years
experience,
had
met
the
three
accomplices
who
were
called
in
the
lower
court,
the
three
thieves.
they
had
been
--
met
them
sometime
earlier
in
the
spring,
april
or
may
and
they
had
come
to
norfolk
with
the
--
norfolk,
virginia,
with
the
idea
that
they
would
go
into
business.
mike
lent
them
their
--
his
automobile.
it
was
licensed
to
travel
in
and
out
the
military
installations
because
of
the
proper
sticker
that
was
on
the
windshield.
on
june
2nd,
1958,
the
jury
still
believed
from
the
evidence
presented
that
mike
and
virginia
milanovich
and
the
company
of
the
three
accomplices,
entered
the
united
states
naval
amphibious
base,
norfolk,
virginia
and
burglarized
the
commissary
store.
the
jury
so
believed
that
virginia
milanovich
was
a
driver
of
the
car
and
that
mike
was
present
therein,
neither
of
the
two
milanovich
has
touched
any
of
the
stolen
property,
did
not
enter
the
building,
did
not
enter
the
safes.
the
three
thieves
broke
into
the
building,
broke
into
the
safes
and
some
$14,000
in
cash,
currency
and
checks
were
removed.
the
burglary
took
such
a
lengthy
time
that
according
to
the
evidence
that
the
jury
believed,
the
milanovichs
did
not
wait
in
their
automobile
at
the
appropriate
rendezvous,
but
returned
to
their
home.
the
three
thieves,
finding
their
transportation
gone,
buried
their
loot
in
the
nearby
woods
and
found
a
way
by
devious
means
to
the
milanovich's
home,
subsequently
left
for
their
respective
homes
in
ohio.
some
two
weeks
later,
on
june
18th,
mr.
grammer,
one
of
the
three
thieves,
returned
to
norfolk
and
visited
with
the
milanovich.
and
the
jury
so
believed
that
at
that
time,
he
and
the
company
of
virginia
milanovich
went
to
the
amphibious
base
and
recovered
some
of
the
stolen
loot.
on
the
morning
of
the
19th,
the
fbi,
on
information,
raided
the
home
of
the
milanovichs
and
there
found
mike
and
virginia
milanovich,
a
female
friend
by
the
name
of
(inaudible)
and
one
of
the
thieves,
mr.
grammer.
at
that
time,
with
permission
of
the
milanovichs,
their
home
was
searched
and
approximately
$1000
wrapped
in
bank
wrappers
of
coins,
were
found
in
two
containers.
one
of
which
was
a
cosmetic
bag
of
virginia
milanovich.
she
denied
knowledge
of
the
money.
she
said
it
was
the
property
of
the
other
woman
in
her
house.
be
that
as
it
may,
the
jury
so
believed
that
this
was
stolen
property
of
the
june
2nd
break-in
that
it
was
in
the
possession
of
virginia
milanovich.
and
under
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
a
principal
and
as
a
receiver.
the
charge
to
the
jury,
we
say,
was
erroneous
and
should
not
have
been
given.
we
say
that
the
jury
should
have
been
so
instructed
that
they
could
have
found
mike
and
virginia
milanovich
guilty
as
a
principal
under
the
larceny
statute
or
as
a
receiver
of
the
stolen
property,
not
both.
the
charge
is
given
to
the
jury
was,
as
i
quote,
"i
might
say
in
passing,
that
if
they
did
participate
as
aiders
and
abettors
that
they
may
be
found
guilty
as
principals,
then
as
to
the
count
as
to
receiving.‚Äù
now
of
course,
if
they
had
actually
removed
the
contents
of
the
safe
themselves,
they
cannot
be
guilty
of
receiving
those
same
contents,
but
the
evidence
is
clear
in
this
case
that
either
mike
milanovich
or
virginia
milanovich
actually
had
their
hands
on
the
safe
or
removed
any
money
from
any
safe.
the
court
is
drawing
a
fine
line
of
distinction,
saying
the
fact
that
they
were
principals
in
the
theft,
that
they
could
also
be
guilty
of
receiving
the
stolen
property,
because
they
did
not
touch
the
loot
at
that
time.
yet
it's
inconceivable
to
think
that
these
two
individuals,
if
they
did
participate
as
they
did
by
driving
the
three
thieves
to
the
scene
and
had
the
loot
and
transported
to
their
automobile
at
that
time,
then
it
would
have
been
split
the
five
ways
at
that
time,
then
there'd
be
a
clearcut
case
and
no
question
would've
been
raised
by
the
district
court
nor
would
we
be
here
today."
but,
here,
they
are
present
and
certainly
if
they
were
present
and
as
drivers
of
the
gateway
vehicle
or
the
transportation,
they
certainly
expected
to
participate
in
the
proceeds.
and
even
though
there
were
some
two
weeks
delay
in
the
actual
receipt
apart
of
the
money
and
of
course,
as
it
might
say
in
passing,
the
other
$13,000
has
never
been
accounted
for,
has
never
been
found,
only
the
$1000
in
coins,
which
could
not
be
removed
at
the
time,
has
been
recovered.
and
we
say
that
they
expected
to
participate
in
the
loot
and
the
interven
--
intervention
of
the
time
has
no
bearing
whatsoever,
that
it
is
one
offense
and
one
alone.
the
fact
that
they
were
tried
on
the
charge
of
--
of
receiving
as
well
as
the
principal,
we
in
the
lower
court,
asked
constantly
that
the
--
the
prosecution
elect.
of
course
the
judge
said,
"it
could
not
be
and
rightly
so."
but
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
that
their
verdict
of
guilty,
if
they
found
either
the
defendants
guilty,
would
be
that
of
either
the
receiving
or
as
a
principal.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
the
majority
of
the
fourth
circuit
did
set
aside
the
receiving
charge,
yes.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
because
virginia
milanovich
asked
for
a
jury
trial.
we
feel
that
in
the
case
of
com
--
commonwealth
versus
haskins,
a
massachusetts
case
in
1880,
where
a
person
was
found
guilty
of
stealing
a
cow
and
having
the
cow
in
his
possession,
was
found
guilty
of
both
offenses
and
the
court
at
that
time,
the
district
attorney
--
commonwealth's
attorney
asked
that
the
case
be
now
cross
as
to
receiving,
the
trial
judge
so
upheld
it,
but
the
court
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
massachusetts
reversed
the
case
saying
that
the
verdict
was
inconsistent
in
law
and
therefore,
no
judgment
could
be
sustained.
and
we
say
the
same
in
this
case.
it
was
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
which
count
they
were
guilty
of.virginia
milanovich
was
given
ten
years
for
the
larceny,
five,
for
the
receipt.
the
evidence
is
such
that
the
jury,
had
he
been
properly
instructed,
may
have
found
that
the
evidence
was
more
credible
as
to
the
receiving
count
and
would
have
found
her
guilty
of
that
alone,
rather
than
the
larceny.
and
we
say
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
well,
we
say
that
this
case
falls
in
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
heflin
case,
where
it
was
set
forth,
very
clearly
that
one
cannot
be
guilty
of
robbing
a
bank
and
possession
of
the
stolen
goods.
that
case
was
decided
in
the
spring
of
1959,
which
was
after
this
particular
trial,
but
we
say
it
is
applicable
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
you
cannot
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
that's
right.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
because
they
were
aiders
and
abettors,
they
were
there
at
the
scene.
they
were
responsible
for
the
three
thieves
to
get
to
the
building.
they
were
as
much
guilty
as
the
three
thieves,
who
actually
touched
the
money.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
right,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
they
vacated
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
but
we
feel
that
had
the
jury
been
so
instructed
that
they
could
only
find
the
defendants
guilty
as
a
principal
or
as
a
receiver.
we
feel
that
that
was
a
correct
inter
--
correct
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
say
that
this
larceny
statute
of
18
u.s.c.
641
is
no
different
from
that
of
the
bank
robbery
statute,
which
this
court
so
decided
in
the
heflin
case,
that
one
could
not
be
guilty
of
bank
robbery
and
receiving
the
loot.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
well,
we
think
that
the
jury
should
have
--
should
have
been
so
instructed
that
they
could
bring
in
only
one
verdict
that
a
person
cannot
be
found
guilty
of
both
as
a
principal
and
as
a
receiver.
and
i
think,
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
legislative
history
is
rather
meager,
just
as
it
is
in
the
bank
robbery
statute.
first,
we
had
the
offense
of
larceny.
then
some
ten
to
12
years
later,
the
second
paragraph
was
added
to
reach
a
new
group
of
wrongdoers
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
pyramid
penalties,
and
that
is
what's
being
done
in
this
case.
and
we
say
that
the
--
no
court,
no
judge
can
vacate
a
sentence
and
say
that
justice
was
done
to
the
defendant.
and
we
feel
that
this
case
should
be
reversed,
this
conviction
is
reversed
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
retrial
under
proper
instructions
that
the
jury
should
be
so
instructed
that
they
can
bring
out
one
verdict
either
for
the
larceny
or
the
receiving.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
on
page
315
of
the
record
where
it
was
said
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
315,
where
it
was
by
mr.
kutulakis
who
is
one
of
the
attorneys
in
a
district
court,
"i
feel
they
were
not
fully
instructed
on
the
law
of
larceny
and
receiving."
that
is
a
reference
that
was
made
as
to
the
charge
that
was
made
to
the
jury.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
at
the
middle
of
the
page.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
that's
after
the
charge
it
been
given.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
at
that
time,
no,
sir.
he
did
not
make
any
objection
at
that
time.
it
was
after
the
charge
had
been
given,
then
we
felt
it
came
to
mind
that
they
should
have
been
instructed
that
they
could
only
bring
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
a
principal
or
as
a
receiver.
we
distinguish
the
aaronson
case
in
this
matter.
that
was
one
where
the
defendant
applying
the
offense,
several
days
in
advance,
made
arrangements
with
two
other
people
to
steal
certain
government
property.
he
was
never
near
the
scene,
did
not
even
participate
in
it
at
all,
but
did
receive
the
stolen
property.
but
in
this
case,
virginia
milanovich
was
right
on
the
scene
and
as
any
--
you
got
a
lookout
and
now,
with
the
getaway
car,
just
as
guilty
as
the
others.
it's
not
possible
in
a
situation
like
this
time
was
not
usual
i
should
think.
for
all,
i
want
to
go
into
the
building.
they
were
there
and
ready
to
make
a
quick
getaway,
if
necessary,
if
caught.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
they
could
be
properly
indicted
and
charged
under
--
a
larceny
count
as
a
principal,
as
being
an
aider
and
abettor.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
as
judge
sobeloff
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
that
the
intervening
time
made
no
difference
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
well,
we
feel
that
it
was
just
a
matter
of
circumstances
that
the
money
was
not
divided
as
of
the
actual
time
of
taking.
had
the
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
but
had
they
been
there
at
the
time
the
loot
was
carried
out,
they
would've
probably
and
could
have
been
charged
similar
manner,
since
they
did
not
actually
go
into
the
building,
did
not
touch
the
contents
of
the
safes,
could
be
probably
found
under
this
charge
as
given
to
the
jury,
would
have
been
found
guilty
by
this
jury
of
both
as
a
principal
and
as
a
receiver.
because
the
judge
says,
"it
makes
no
difference."
he
said
--
he
says,
"if
they
had
actually
removed
the
contents
of
the
safe
themselves,
they
cannot
be
guilty
of
receiving
those
same
contents."
but
the
fact
that
somebody
else
gave
it
to
them,
made
the
difference.
and
we
say,
it
makes
no
difference
because
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
it
did
not
mention
the
intervening
time.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
the
evidence
was
before
the
jury
that
there
was
an
intervening
time.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
it
is
affirmed
and
the
evidence
is
there
that
the
stolen
property
was
found
in
the
milanovich's
home.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
we
do
not
attack
the
sufficiency
of
that
evidence,
but
we
sit
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
not
as
presented
to
the
jury
in
this
case,
as
it
now
stands.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
but
we
didn't
say
that
it
is
more
creditable
that
they
would
be
found
guilty
of
receiving,
rather
than
as
a
principal,
because
the
testimony
that
makes
them
a
principal
in
this
crime
is
based
entirely
on
that
of
the
three
accomplices,
the
three
thieves.
the
other
evidence
that
the
court
so
found
is
rather
weak
as
to
the
identification
of
the
milanovichs
as
being
a
principal.
but
it's
conclusive
as
to
the
receiving
that
the
money
was
found
in
the
milanovich's
home
in
a
piece
of
luggage,
which
belonged
to
virginia.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes.
but
we
say
also
that
if
the
judge
had
so
properly
instructed
the
jury
and
said,
you
can
find
them
guilty
of
only
one
or
the
other,
that
the
evidence
is
such.
that
we
feel
that
she
would
have
been
found
guilty
as
a
receiver,
rather
than
as
a
principal
and
since
the
last
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
at
the
time,
yes,
sir.
but
as
to
the
receiving,
his
conduct
was
so
different
that
he
could
not
have
been
found
guilty
as
a
receiver
as
well.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
and
the
fourth
circuit
so
also
took
it
away,
by
vacating
the
lesser
sentence
and
allowing
the
larger
to
stand.
and
we
say,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
the
largest
sentence,
that
this
court
should
not
allow
that
to
stand
and
take
it
away
from
the
province
of
the
jury,
when
it
is
very
probable
and
possible
that
they
would
impose
a
conviction
on
the
receiving
and
that
the
lighter
sentence
would
be
given
to
virginia.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
same
as
the
principal
and
yet
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
it's
very
possible
that
he
would've,
but
he
didn't.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
the
jury
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
but
we
say
that
it
was
error
to
allow
it
to
go
to
the
jury.
even
regardless
of
what
the
sentence
was
that
the
verdict
was
inconsistent
in
law
and
that
it
should
be
reversed.
and
that
the
trial
court
and
the
jury
should
decide
what
a
person
is
guilty
of,
just
following
the
heflin
case.
we're
not
asking
for
that
the
rule
of
lenity
be
applied
in
this
case,
which
was
applied
in
both
the
heflin
and
the
prince
case,
which
is
where
both
the
defendants
were
already
serving
their
sentences.
in
this
case,
no
sentence
has
been
served,
no
time
has
been
spent
and
we're
asking
that
the
convictions
be
set
aside
and
that
a
retrial
be
issued
on
the
grounds
of
--
that
they
were
improperly
instructed.
and
we
feel
that
the
statute
is
very
clear
that
you
can
only
be
guilty
of
one,
whether
you're
an
aider
or
an
abettor
and
you're
found
guilty
as
a
principal,
you
cannot
be
found
guilty
as
a
principal.
and
that
setting
aside
the
sentence
does
not
alter
the
fact
that
they
have
been
found
guilty
of
two
separate
and
distinct
offenses
though
they're
very
related.
the
larceny
and
receiving
has
always
been
held
as
two
separate
offenses
and
in
this
case,
that
the
jury
should
have
been
so
instructed.
it'd
be
one
or
the
other
and
not
both.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
because
we
feel
that
the
defendants
were
deprived
of
the
proper
rights
in
the
court
by
not
having
the
jury
so
instructed.
we
feel
that
virginia
should
have
the
charge
only
if
the
court
so
feels
of
being
found
guilty
as
the
receiver
and
not
as
a
principal.
and
as
such,
if
she
is
so
found
guilty
as
a
receiver,
that
her
sentence
would
be
the
lighter
one,
rather
than
the
heavier
one.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
because
we
feel
they'd
be
up
to
the
jury
to
decide
rather
than
for
the
court.
and
at
the
end,
that
justice
would
be
better
reached
by
having
the
decision
so
made
that
one
cannot
be
found
guilty
as
a
principal
and
as
a
receiver.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
the
court
could
so
do
that
and
that's
exactly
--
well,
the
fourth
circuit
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
because
we
feel
that
possibly
--
that
in
a
new
trial,
i
would
say
that
there's
other
evidence,
which
could
be
presented,
which
may
or
may
not
offer
the
verdict
of
the
jury.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
that's
not
the
point.
we're
saying
that
in
view
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
there'd
be
no
question.
no
error.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no
reason
for
it.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
they
--
they
said
they
--
the
charge
the
jury
was
that
she
could
be
found
guilty
of
both.
it
wasn't
an
either
or.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
it
was
that
she
would
be
found
guilty
as
a
principal
and
guilty
as
a
receiver,
because
she
did
not
actually
touch
the
contents
of
the
safe.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
there'd
be
no
grounds
for
it.
no
reason
for
it.
the
reason
we're
here
is
because
she
was
found
guilty
of
both,
when
she
should
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
true,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
if
the
court
so
found
that
she
would
get
the
lesser
sentence,
then
she
would
not
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
well,
we
don't
--
we
don't
see
--
we
don't
see
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
but
we
say
it
was
error
in
the
first
place,
the
fact
that
they
were
not
separate,
that
they
could
only
be
found
guilty
either
as
a
principal
or
as
a
receiver.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
but
we
feel
it
goes
back
to
that
massachusetts
case,
where
it
said
they
both
were
inconsistent
and
that
they
could
only
be
found
guilty
of
one
or
the
other.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
and
that
is
up
to
the
jury
to
decide,
not
for
the
appellate
judges
or
any
of
the
trial
judges.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
she'll
get
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
for
either,
but
not
for
either
of
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
the
trial
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
and
the
charge
should
again
an
either
or
and
not
both.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
we
do
not
know.
no
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
we
do
not
know
because
that's
within
the
province
of
the
judge
alone.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
--
as
to
sentencing.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
that's
right.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
but
her
husband
will
only
receive
five
years
for
his
part.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
that
is
not
in
the
record.
it's
true
that
he
said
that
and
her
life
of
crime
consistent
of
one
conviction
for
a
misdemeanor
of
which
she
served
nine
months
in
the
state
institution,
welfare
institutions
in
virginia,
was
illegal
sale
of
whiskey.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
right
in
the
judge's
statement.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
it's
--
in
--
i'm
sorry.
it
is
in
the
record,
where
he
does
so
make
that
statement.
and
that's
her
life
of
crime.
the
rest
of
it
is
merely
his
own
knowledge
of
her
over
a
period
of
years,
as
what's
personal
knowledge
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no,
sir.
only
to
the
fact
that
he
said,
"you,
virginia
milanovich
have
led
a
life
of
crime."
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
--
and
the
only
sides,
the
one
conviction
--
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
yes,
sir.
ten
for
the
principle.
mr.
j.
hubbard
davis
no
sir,
nothing
was
said.
no
comment.
mr.
bergan
will
take
up
the
other
question
which
relates
to
both.
