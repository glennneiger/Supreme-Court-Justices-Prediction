mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
leave
out
a
consideration
for
the
moment,
the
conviction
for
larceny,
is
there
any
infirmity
in
the
evidence,
so
far
as
--
as
knowing
you're
receiving
stolen
property
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
know
in
fact
the
sufficiency
of
that
evidence
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
nor
on
the
evidence
--
yes,
nor
on
the
other
hand,
do
you
attack
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
the
larceny
charge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
--
is
there
any
interweaving
of
--
of
the
testimony
which
would
compel
him
to
which
--
to
which
the
jury
would
consider
some
of
the
testimony
on
the
larceny
in
order
to
convict
on
the
knowing
or
receiving
stolen
property
or
vice
versa?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
point
that
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
think
it's
more
likely
that
they
would
find
her
guilty
of
receiving
than
--
than
of
--
of
the
larceny,
because
they
did
find
her
husband
been
guilty
of
the
larceny
and
--
and
his
conduct
was
almost
precisely
the
same
as
her,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
so
the
--
so
the
judge
held
and
took
it
away
from
the
jury,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
discretion,
suppose
under
these
instructions
that
you
complained
of,
the
jury
had
found
mrs.
milanovich
guilty
only
of
knowingly
receiving
stolen
property
and
the
judge
had
given
her
ten
years,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
understood
--
as
i
understood,
the
judge
did
not
instruct
the
--
the
jury
that
they
could
only
find
her
guilty
of
one.
didn't
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
but
you
think
those
instructions
were
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
suppose
under
those
instructions,
she
had
been
found
guilty
only
of
knowing
they're
receiving
stolen
property
or
only
of
larceny
and
he
had
given
her
ten
years
and
her
husband
five,
was
he
did,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
can't
see
much
difference
then
between
that
situation
--
situation
you
got
here,
if
--
if
we
decide
that
she
cannot
be
--
does
not
have
to
serve
time
for
both.
now,
you're
--
you're
in
exactly
the
same
position
you
would
be
on
those
circumstances,
are
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
what
--
how
was
she
injured?
chief
justice
earl
warren
both,
no.
not
the
lesser
when
we
--
we
--
they
know
of
no
reason
why
we
should
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
no
reason
why
we
should
have
to
pick
out
the
lesser
ones.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
base
it
on
--
on
a
bad
charge
to
the
jury,
i
can't
see
what
makes
much
difference
to
you
whether
--
whether
she
was
convicted
on
one
or
both,
if
we
set
one
aside.
that's
exactly
what
you
would
have
if
they'd
only
found
her
guilty
of
one
of
those
offenses.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
used
up
all
your
time
and
that's
--
that's
the
difficulty
with
trying
to
have
two
counsel
in
--
in
the
summary
docket
cases
and
variably
as
this
way
and
--
and
we
shouldn't
do
it.
i've
granted
the
time
against
my
better
judgment,
but
i'll
give
you
three
minutes
to
--
and
more,
to
argue
your
other
point.
but
really
in
the
summary
cases,
should
not
be
more
than
one
counsel
and
--
and
counsel
should
ask
to
divide
their
time.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bishop
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
may
i
ask
you
to
address
yourself
to
this
question?
assume
that
the
--
the
judge
feels
that
receiving
stolen
property
is
not
a
serious
crime
as
-
as
larceny,
yes.
and
that
that
is
the
reason
why
he
gave
her
five
years
on
the
receiving
and
ten
years
on
the
--
on
the
larceny.
is
there
not
a
--
some
reason
to
believe
that
if
the
jury
had
only
found
her
guilty
of
receiving,
that
he
might
have
given
her
five
years
instead
of
the
ten
and
the
five
to
--
to
run
concurrently?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
there's
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
agree
with
you.
we're
not
entitled
to
assume
that,
but
take
the
--
take
the
other
horn
--
horn
of
the
dilemma
and
say
that
she
had
been
acquitted
of
--
of
larceny,
because
the
jury
believed
that
the
--
the
proof
was
better,
that
she
had
been
--
was
guilty
of
receiving.
now,
have
we
any
assurance
that
the
judge
would
have
given
her
more
than
the
five
years
imprisonment
that
he
did
inflict
for
that
particular
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
think
it
would've
made
any
difference
whether
the
jury
found
her
guilty
of
both
larceny
and
receiving
or
whether
the
jury
had
found
her
not
guilty
of
larceny,
but
had
only
found
her
guilty
of
--
of
receiving?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
not.
you
do
not
think
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
my
problem
was
--
my
problem
is
this
mr.
bishop.
chief
justice
earl
warren
should
we
assume
--
are
we
entitled
to
assume
that
the
judge
would
give
exactly
the
same
sentences
in
this
situation
that
he
would
have
given,
if
the
jury
had
found
her
not
guilty
of
larceny,
but
only
guilty
of
receiving
stolen
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
going
to
ask
though
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so,
if
we
can
make
that
assumption
legally,
are
we
entitled
to
assume
legally,
that
if
the
jury
could
only
find
her
guilty
of
one
of
the
two,
if
it
had
found
her
guilty
of
receiving,
but
not
of
larceny
that
--
that
the
judge
would've
given
her
as
much
time
as
he
did
give
her,
when
the
jury
found
her
guilty
of
both?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
