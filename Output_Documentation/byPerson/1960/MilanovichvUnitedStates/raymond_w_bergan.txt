mr.
raymond
w.
bergan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
three
minutes
will
be
sufficient
for
this
second
point.
the
second
point
which
is
in
the
case
before
the
court
is
one
which
affects
both
convictions.
but
the
only
one
which
affects
the
conviction
of
the
petitioner,
mike
milanovich,
simply
stated
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
this
point,
is
that
once
having
excluded
prospective
witnesses
from
the
courtroom,
it
was
error
for
the
trial
judge
not
to
make
this
exclusion
effective
by
failing
to
admonish
them
not
to
discuss
their
testimony.
at
the
early
stages
of
the
case
before
the
first
witness
was
called
upon
the
request
of
the
counsel
for
the
defendants,
the
judge
excluded.
the
trial
judge
excluded
the
witnesses
from
the
courtroom.
the
further
request
of
counsel
for
the
defendants
that
the
witness
be
admonished
not
to
discuss
their
testimony
with
each
other
before
they
had
testified
or
to
discuss
the
testimony
which
had
already
been
given
with
witnesses
who
already
had
testified,
was
denied
by
the
trial
court.
his
ruling
appears
on
the
record
at
pages
33
and
again
at
pages
50
to
52.
now
of
course,
we
concede
that
exclusion
of
witnesses
from
the
trial
of
courtroom
in
civil
and
criminal
cases
as
a
matter
of
discretion
for
the
trial
court.
but
without
a
very
good
reason,
it
appears
logical
and
it
would
appear
that
logic
alone
would
require
that
once
having
exercised
is
right
and
his
discretion
to
exclude
witnesses
from
the
courtroom
that
the
judge
ought
to
have
a
very
good
reason
not
to
make
his
exclusion
effective.
i
think
if
the
court
will
refer
to
the
ruling
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
which
is
at
page
344
of
the
record,
you
will
note
the
court
of
appeals
although
not
reversing
the
conviction
on
this
point,
point
it
out
that
we
wish
to
indicate
our
view,
this
is
halfway
down
the
first
paragraph.
"we
wish
to
indicate
our
view
that
ordinarily
when
a
judge
exercise
his
discretion
to
exclude
witnesses,
it
would
seem
proper
for
him
to
take
the
further
step
of
making
the
exclusion
effective."
in
fact,
what
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case
was
not
to
exercise
any
discretion
as
to
decline
to
instruct
witnesses
to
give
them
this
admonition.
the
trial
judge
as
appears
on
pages
33
of
the
record,
when
the
request
was
made,
pointed
out
to
counsel
for
the
defendants,
"i
do
not
think
the
court
can
possibly
police
such
a
situation.
the
fine
points
of
questioning
or
matters
of
course
that
are
relevant
that
there
is
not
much
i
can
do
about
such
situation.
despite
my
size,
the
trial
judge
continues
i'm
only
one
man
and
i
cannot
be
in
more
than
one
place
at
a
time."
again
at
page
50,
the
trial
court
says,
"mr.
kutulakis,
i
cannot
be
a
policeman.
the
witnesses
have
been
separated,
but
there
is
no
law
at
anytime
which
prohibits
them
from
talking
to
anyone
--
prohibits
anyone
from
talking
to
the
witnesses."
we
submit
the
trial
court
erred
in
saying
that
there
was
no
law
that
prohibited
the
witnesses.
the
trial
court
could
have
made
such
a
law.
this
court
has
sanctioned
the
punishment
of
--
of
contempt
for
the
violation
of
such
ruling
in
the
holder
case.
the
trial
court
has
the
authority,
the
discretion
if
it
wishes,
for
the
violation
of
such
a
rule
to
exclude
the
testimony.
now,
we
submit
that
it's
analogous
to
the
case
of
charles
versus
the
united
states,
which
is
reported
at
215
f.2d,
at
page
828,
where
the
district
court
of
hawaii
had
refused
to
issue
a
rule
excluding
witnesses
because
we
don't
do
that
anymore
it
said.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out
that
this
was
not
reason
enough.
it's
a
matter
that's
addressed
to
the
discretion
of
the
court.
we
submit
that
in
--
particularly
in
the
case
of
this
type,
where
it's
all
accomplished
testimony
that
the
rule
should
have
been
issued.
