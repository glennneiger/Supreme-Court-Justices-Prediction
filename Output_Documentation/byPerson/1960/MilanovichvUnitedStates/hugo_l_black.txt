it's
on?

black
(voice

to
make
statement
as
to
why
he
was
imposing
different
sentences
on
the
different
counts?

in

ten
and
one
to
five,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo

did
he
make
any
statement
as
to
why
he
thought
she
could
only
suffer
five
years
of
receiving
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
tried
to
ask
you,
what
was
the
source
for
the
court
of
appeals'
power
to
choose
one
of
these,
rather
than
the
other
to
leave
an
effect?
there
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
one
could
have
been
left,
could
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
had
to
be
a
choice
made
that
made
a
difference
of
five
years
to
the
defendant.
what
was
the
source
of
the
court's
power
to
choose
the
one
who
gave
ten,
rather
than
the
one
who
gave
five?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
what
they
did,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
what
was
the
court
--
what
was
the
court
--
source
of
the
court
of
appeals'
power
to
wipe
out
one
that
was
five
and
leave
in
one
that
was
ten?
justice
hugo
l.
black
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
--
didn't
both
--
couldn't
do
both,
but
the
court
didn't
say
that
you
couldn't
do
one,
did
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
--
your
argument
--
this
is
--
i
didn't
know
the
government
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
asked
--
you're
arguing
that
the
court
had
to
do
what
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
no
choice
as
the
jury
would
have
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
about
the
district
court,
was
there
any
choice
for
him
if
he
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
he
was
wrong
in
his
charge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
what
he
would've
done,
what
could
he
have
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
he
could've
given
a
ten-year
sentence
on
either
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
he
could
have
done,
with
reference
to
choosing
the
one
rather
than
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
assuming
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
your
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
have
any
discretion
that
it
had
to
if
it's
accepted
one,
except
the
larceny?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
had
to
accept
the
one
that
was
used
--
it's
your
position
that
he
had
to
accept
the
larceny,
because
the
larceny
was
the
one
that
is
invalid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
could
not
have
accepted
the
--
the
receiving
count
conviction
because
that
was
not
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
were
wrong
on
that
--
suppose
--
suppose
you
were
wrong
on
that
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
for
either
one,
then
what's
the
source
of
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
it
the
discretionary
power
and
its
general
power
to
do
what
justice
required?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
says
that,
doesn't
it,
with
reference
to
an
appeal?
i
thought
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
it
says
disposition
of
the
case
as
justice
required,
i
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
pyramided,
but
could
it
--
could
it
have
been
imposed
under
this
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
--
could
she
have
been
found
guilty
of
receiving
legally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
opposite.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
sacrifice
had
considerably
(voice
overlap)
if
that's
correct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
how
can
we
know
either
way
of
that,
we
can't
can
we?
i
would
think
that
probably
a
judge
might
proceed
on
one
of
the
counts.
he
might
be
reversed
on
one
of
them,
if
you
get
speculated.
what
we
have
is
a
case
where
we
cannot
know
what
the
judge
would
have
done,
isn't
it?
if
there
had
been
a
five
--
if
sentence
or
conviction
merely
for
the
one
different,
don't
we?
we
can't
know
it.
but
we
do
have
a
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
it
and
selected
whatever
you
want
to
call,
wiping
out
or
the
other.
it
left
one
in
effect
and
obliterated
the
other.
the
one
that
was
left
in
effect
was
the
larger
one.
it
could
have
done
either,
couldn't
he?
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
your
argument
here,
that's
why
you
say
it
couldn't
have
left
the
other
in
effect.
the
jury
could
have
found
either
way.
it's
was
justice
frankfurter,
suggested
they
couldn't
be
as
capricious
as
they
desire,
if
that
caprice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wrongfully
--
wrongfully
under
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it's
what
the
court
of
appeal
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
inconsistent,
they
found
that
they
convicted
on
two
counts.
when
under
the
law,
they
could
only
convict
on
the
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
except
it
did
have
something
to
do
with
the
sentence,
which
is
the
only
thing
it
interest
us
here.
that
she
has
gotten
a
ten-year
sentence,
by
reason
of
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
had
said
has
said,
"we'll
leave
the
out
of
effect,
should
it
gotten
filed."
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
let
--
that's
talk
about
another
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
we
do
not
have
this
problem.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
we
have
here
is
an
actual
problem
of
what
we'll
do,
where
there
were
ten-year
in
sentence
and
a
five-year
sentence.
the
court
said
it's
wrong.
you
couldn't
convict
them
on
both.
one
of
them
happens
to
be
concurred.
we
don't
know
what
--
we
--
we
can't
possibly
know
what
could've
been
done.
and
our
problem
is
whether,
what
is
our
power,
our
duty
and
connection
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
go
to
any
consequence
at
all,
except
we've
got
to
review
what
the
court
of
appeal
did.
if
it
had
a
right
--
if
it
had
a
right
and
power
to
do
what
it
did,
then
i
assume
that
we
should
stay
that
way,
unless
we
think,
if
in
some
way,
it
was
--
so
badly
wrong
that
we
should
reverse
it
and
say
that
it
should
have
taken
the
lighter
--
impose
the
lighter
sentence.
accepted
the
lighter
sentence,
i
suppose
that's
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh
yes,
but
my
question
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
involved
any
idea
of
a
complete
reversal
of
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
possible
way
to
come
in
or
went
near
ascertaining
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
--
if
it
is
to
be
ascertained,
except
to
take
--
send
it
back
to
the
judge
and
say,
“now,
you
were
wrong
in
imposing
sentence
on
both,
we
don't
know
what
you
would
have
done,
sentence
the
prisoner.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
wouldn't
be
absolute
because
he
might
do
differently
now
than
what
he
would
have
done
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
assume
if
--
if
that's
the
test
that
we
should
follow,
that's
the
nearest
we
could
come
to
it
rather
than
to
just
indulge
in
speculation
or
what
some
other
courts
had
speculated
in
some
other
cases
about
what
a
judge
would
or
might
have
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
be
(inaudible)
according
to
the
judge
who
has
the
initial
power
to
sentence
him,
what's
the
harm
if
--
when
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
new
situation
comes
up,
he's
given
a
right
to
sentence
him
according
to
his
belief,
if
that's
his
right
and
has
found.
if
it's
a
defendant's
right
to
have
him
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
circumstances
then
before
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he's
imposed
the
sentence
of
five
years
on
one
which
it
might
have
been
the
one
or
might
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
should
we
assume
that
he's
a
--
it's
his
desire
to
give
here
the
heavier
sentence
--
sentence
possible
under
all
circumstance
and
traditions
because
he
gave
out
one
sentence
and
then
added
five
years
concurrently
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
might
have
been
imposed
on
him
maybe?
