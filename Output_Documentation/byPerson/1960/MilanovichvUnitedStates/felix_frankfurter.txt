but
the
guilt
of
larceny
in
turn,
on
the
ruling
of
the
law,
whether
an
aider
or
an
abettor
scam
the
principals,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
matter
for
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably,
if
the
jury
instructed
it,
you
find
that
they
in
fact
did
aide
and
abet.
they
are
principals,
proper,
the
jury
had
any
choice.
they
can
--
the
jury
can
do
anything
but
he
can't
go
behind
their
determination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
is
that
they
couldn't
be
guilty
or
--
but
you
can't
impose
two
punishments
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
what
is
--
or
what
had
you
argued
a
minute
ago,
it's
only
offense
in
--
in
its
--
in
its
sequence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose,
appellee
milanovichs
--
milanovichs
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
had
left
as
they
did
and
the
money
has
been
--
the
loot
has
been
accomplished
by
the
so-called
three
thieves
and
the
money
had
been
dissipated
by
them
so
that
(inaudible)
come
to
the
couple,
would
they
be
tried
for
larceny?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
they
will
give
them
money.
in
fact
they
will
give
them
money.
and
they
were
indicted
on
two
separate
counts,
the
two
offenses
not
pleading
him
as
murder,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
court
of
the
appeals
set
aside
one
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
get
the
course
of
your
answer
to
justice
douglas'
question,
other
than
to
take
care
of
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
said
is
they
can't
be
punished,
because
it's
only
one
offense,
but
they
can
grip
more
because
there
had
been
no
receipt
subsequently
in
aiding
and
abetting
making
them
principals
wouldn't
have
evaporated.
they
would've
been
guilty
of
that,
they
--
after
they
received
money
and
they
can't
be
punished
for
both,
but
one
offense
hasn't
evaporated.
there's
one
thing
to
say,
people
can't
be
punished
for
what
turns
out
to
be
a
single
move
that
can
--
having
two
constituents,
(inaudible)
but
the
offenses
having
been
committed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
they
--
when
their
car
left,
when
their
car
left
and
assuming
as
of
that
time,
the
--
the
three
accomplices
had
rifled
the
safe,
part
of
the
situation
with
reference
that
they
had
him.
before
they
receive
a
penny,
what
was
the
legal
situation
and
what
could
properly
be
charged
--
for
what
could
they
be
properly
indicted
and
what
could
be
properly
charged
against
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say,
if
two
weeks
later,
they
received
some
money,
they
can
no
longer
be
charged
for
larceny,
as
well
as
considering
the
intervening
time
also
for
receiving
goods
and
having
the
proper
charges
to
each
on
which
the
jury
could
find
either
or
both,
leaving
the
question
of
what
punishment
should
be
involved
is
a
very
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
he
says
it,
but
i'm
trying
to
test
it
whether
what
he
says
is
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
matter
of
circumstances
that
some
people
don't
carry
out
a
planned
crime
and
therefore,
the
result
is
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
it's
charged
and
referred
to
the
intervening
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
before
the
jury,
the
whole
--
the
evidences.
a
charge
was
made
with
reference
to
what
the
evidence
showed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
the
jury
of
layman
can
understand
the
people
get
the
money,
a
thousand
dollars,
they
received
and
those
thousand
dollars
that
were
stolen.
the
jury
can
well
understand
that
they
are
the
recipients
of
a
thousand
dollar
stolen
good.
but
you
are
saying
that
the
idea
of
being
a
principal
to
the
rather
aider
and
abettor,
is
the
more
complicated
thing
for
a
jury
to
understand
and
therefore,
they
could
--
might
rather
disregard
it,
the
judge's
charge
on
the
matter
of
law,
that's
what
they
said,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
because
the
evidence
was
lacking
for
them
to
solve
a
crime,
but
because
it's
this
metaphysical
notion
that
the
person
who
aides
and
abets
in
the
law,
is
a
principal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
ask
for
a
new
trial
rather
than
a
modification
of
a
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
why
don't
you
ask
this
court
the
lighter
sentence
--
that
the
sentence
be
modified
there'd
a
direction
or
remission
for
the
district
court
or
a
modification
of
the
sentence
to
the
lighter
one?
you
don't
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
they
couldn't
be
found
guilty
of
either
and
that
the
evidence
justified
the
jury
in
finding
them
guilty
of
either.
so
why
do
you
want
to
do
a
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
understand
your
argument.
but
if
--
if
they
could've
been
--
they
could've
been
found
guilty
of
either
and
weren't
back
upon
guilty
of
both
and
sentences
were
imposed
to
the
reference
to
both,
although
not
--
although
not
in
sequence
or
no
--
why
isn't
the
answer
say
since
this
was
only
one
offense
as
a
matter
of
whatever
it
is
for
the
fashion
in
good
sense
that
the
lower
(inaudible)
and
not
the
higher.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
you're
asking
--
you're
asking
for
a
new
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
consistent
to
have
been
--
to
have
her
--
to
had
her
indicted
for
both.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
not
have
been
inconsistent
to
select
either
of
the
two
and
stand
on
that,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
not
be
inconsistent
for
the
--
for
the
judge
to
allow
the
jury
to
find
on
either
and
then
to
--
for
her
to
receive
the
ten-year
sentence,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
on
this
--
on
this
speculated
set
of
physical
point,
some
error
is
in
the
case,
which
one
can't
palpably
touch
like
--
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
say
that
an
obstruction
here,
which
has
done
nobody
any
harm,
but
somehow
that
the
law
frowned
upon
the
irregularity
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
do
have
a
pretty
good
idea
that
he
thought
the
transaction
was
worth
ten
--
ten
years
i
suppose
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
you
don't
mean
to
suggest
mr.
bishop
that
on
the
charge
--
on
the
charge
as
given
by
the
court
and
what
he
left
to
the
jury
with
reference
to
the
two
counts.
they
could
not
have
brought
in
a
verdict
of
a
quicker
as
aiders
and
abettors
principals
and
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilty
as
receiver.
we
don't
need
to
deny
the
jury
could
have
done
that
but
whatever
reason,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
the
advice
of
the
instruction
that
could've
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
been
invalidated?
i
thought
the
difficulty
was
that
the
receiving
grew
out
their
participation
--
or
participation
in
the
aiding
and
abetting.
what
was
the
substantive
advice
that
would
have
invalidated
the
receiving
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
the
receiving
count
and
if
you
agree
to
the
most
capricious
verdict
of
quickly
on
the
larceny
count?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
--
if
i
may
say
so,
the
vice
is
not
in
what
he
charged.
the
vice
is
the
connection
of
the
receiving
count
with
the
larceny
count.
and
that's
why
all
these
talk
about
speculative
to
be
doesn't
touch
reality.
there
was
no
speculation
here
that
in
fact
as
i
understand
it
or
you
haven't
told
in
the
record,
in
fact,
there
was
no
controversy.
i
don't
mean
to
say
there
was
no
defense,
but
essentially,
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
she
did
share
in
bringing
the
three
looters
to
the
station
and,
in
fact,
waited
there
for
them
to
do
their
job,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
she
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
outward
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
this
is
what
was
on
the
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
this
is
a
case
like
the
second
massachusetts
case,
not
the
first
one.
this
is
like
justice
holmes'
decision
in
(inaudible)
there
is
no
inconsistency
in
the
larceny
and
receiving
count
in
this
case,
in
any
sense
for
the
inconsistency
has
any
meaning,
in
any
sense
that
the
doctrine
of
this
court
is
to
be
observed.
this
court
doesn't
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
inconsistency
in
counts,
no
matter
what
the
jury
does.
and
in
this
case,
the
jury
could've
found
either
one
of
the
other
and
was
perfectly
claimed
that
the
sentence
was
imposed
by
the
judges
with
full
awareness
of
all
the
circumstance
in
reference
to
this
defense,
so
we
don't
have
to
speculate
much,
do
we,
in
this
case?
am
i
wrong
about
that?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
assumed
that's
an
affirmance
as
if
the
question
whether
the
facts
justified
affirmance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
one
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
i
may
say
so,
in
going
out
in
old
experience,
is
the
common
place.
at
least
in
my
experience,
well,
what
--
what
happen
doesn't
yield
in
watching
sentencing
by
federal
judges.
that
if
the
second
sentence
is
concurrent,
they
throw
that
in
as
a
sort
of
--
with
not
much
concern
what
their
--
if
it's
--
if
it's
a
concurrent
sentence,
if
--
if
it's
not
to
be
add
--
if
it's
not
be
added
to
the
punishment,
but
is
merely
directed
formally
to
a
verdict
of
guilty.
that's
the
very
common
place
to
think.
they
can
give
him
ten
years
or
eight
years
and
then
let's
say
on
a
second
count
whatever
the
difference
is,
two
years
drawn
concurrently,
hadn't
much
meaning.
they
just
want
to
fix
the
sentence
to
that
for
which
they
will
not
be
in
addition
of
serving
of
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
--
the
question
of
justice
black
as
what
the
real
question,
namely,
our
duty
with
reference
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
and
we
say,
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
record,
misinterpreted
the
provision
of
the
sentence.
out
of
an
independent
judge
or
what
we
think
ought
to
be
done
on
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
throw
it
back
to
the
district
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
impose
a
new
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
bishop,
may
i
ask
you
whether
you've
been
to
several
cases
in
which
you
indicated
there
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
a
longer
sentence
and
the
shortest
sentence
and
for
one
reason
or
another,
one
of
the
sentences
fails
and
the
decision
was
that
that
longer
sentence
should
--
should
be
prevail,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
27?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
at
the
bottom,
26
to
27.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
picture
you
cited
there,
you
also
cited
some
on
--
none
of
which
i've
looked
at
it
yet.
you
also
cited
some
on
page
--
what
about
those
cases
on
25,
page
25?
what
i
should
like
to
have
you
do
if
you
will,
give
me
the
cases
that
i
--
you
think
are
precisely
of
this
character,
namely,
two
counts
for
jury
verdict
on
both
or
a
--
a
jury
--
not
a
general
verdict,
which
is
a
different
story
and
yet
--
but
a
specific
verdict
of
guilty
on
each
count,
on
appeal,
one
of
the
counts
fall
and
the
longer
sentence
was
retained.
now,
which
one
of
your
cases
extend
for
that
proposition,
on
the
assumption
--
on
the
assumption
that
the
record
convinced
the
court
of
appeal
that
the
judge's
longer
sentence
is
the
one
you
would
have
been
imposed,
because
although
there
may
have
been
two
counts,
there
was
one
transaction?
which
cases
has
a
less
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
mean
the
parties
names
have
to
be
debate
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
isn't
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that,
it
isn't
only
that.
it
is
that
he's
imposed
the
sentence
of
ten
years
on
a
count
that
is
not
invalid.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
set
aside
the
one
in
which
he's
invalidly
imposed
a
sentence.
