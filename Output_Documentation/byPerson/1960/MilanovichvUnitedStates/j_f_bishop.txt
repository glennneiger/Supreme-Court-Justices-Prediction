mr.
j.
f.
bishop
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
both
of
the
issues
presented
for
petitioners,
i
looked
at
some
of
the
record
and
maybe
of
assistance
here,
see
what
happens,
see
which
witnesses
testified
to
which
facts,
what
instructions
were
asked
for,
when
they
were
to
asked
for
and
what
instructions
were
given.
preliminarily
as
to
the
point
just
argued
with
respect
to
the
witnesses,
government's
position
is
relatively
simple.
that
is,
we
know
of
no
rule
promulgated
by
this
court
and
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
we
know
of
no
congressional
enactment,
no
constitutional
provision
and
no
decisions,
which
are
sought
to
circumscribe
the
discretion
of
a
trial
judge
in
dealing
with
witnesses
in
a
particular
case,
under
the
particular
circumstances.
and
with
a
look
at
the
record,
i
believe
we
will
show
that
there
was
not
something
of
the
type
of
the
charles
case,
where
the
port
abdicated
its
function,
but
that
was
here
an
exercise
the
discretion
by
a
judge,
whom
we
perhaps,
can't
even
evaluate
on
the
pulled
record
who
had
a
difficult
problem,
some
50
to
70
witnesses
and
did
what
it
could
about
it.
but
we'll
get
back
to
that
with
the
record.
returning
also
preliminarily
to
the
first
point
with
respect
to
virginia
milanovich
alone
that
has
been
explored
rather
extensively
by
the
court
and
what
has
been
suggested
by
the
court
of
course,
is
the
government's
position.
virginia
milanovich
was
convicted
of
aiding
and
abetting,
the
three
safecrackers,
who
went
on
to
the
naval
base
and
also
of
assisting
in
their
escape.
on
that
count,
separate
instructions
were
given.
there
were
separate
facts
we
submit
and
there
was
a
separate
verdict.
we
don't
have
the
problem
here
of
a
general
verdict
of
a
jury
where
we
have
any
doubt
as
to
what
the
jury
found.
there
were
two
separate
verdicts
on
the
two
separate
counts.
now,
the
second
count
as
has
been
observed
by
members
of
the
court
was
the
count
of
receiving
and
concealing.
dealing
with
a
matter
some
two
weeks
later
and
relating
only
to
one
of
these
safecrackers
who
gave
some
of
the
money
to
virginia
milanovich.
now,
as
to
that
count
and
as
to
the
instruction
on
that
count,
issue
was
taken.
and
as
to
that
issue,
we
are
not
here
discussing
a
question
of
multiple
sentences.
that
sentence
on
the
receiving
count
has
been
vacated
and
we
know
of
no
challenge
of
any
of
the
instructions,
the
separate
instructions
if
you
please,
on
the
aiding
and
abetting
of
larceny,
so
that
we
end
a
familiar
case
which
has
appeared
before
this
court,
perhaps
some
numbers
of
times,
but
one
count
being
bad,
that
has
been
separately
handled,
not
on
a
question
of
fact
or
any
inconsistency
of
the
facts.
there
is
no
question
that
both
of
these
things
happened.
that
virginia
milanovich
did
both
of
these
things.
the
question
is
--
has
--
as
has
been
suggested,
the
question
of
law
and
that
maybe
noted
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
not
set
aside
the
sentence
on
receiving
in
any
idea,
without
reaching
at
all,
the
question
that
there
was
inconsistency
of
facts.
but
solely,
on
the
basis
that
in
and
their
interpretation
of
the
statute,
they
felt
that
the
rule
of
this
court
and
heflin
applied
and
that
there
could
be
only
one
punishment.
and
accordingly,
set
at
the
receiving,
sentence
aside
and
with
that,
we
insist
that
all
has
been
done
for
her
that
needs
to
be
done.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
accepting
the
assumptions
which
upon
a
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
accepting
those
assumptions,
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
in
other
words,
the
judge
had
here
two,
shall
we
say
separate
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
things,
separate
counts,
separate
verdicts.
we
know
what
the
judge
--
at
what
amount
the
judge
evaluated
the
aiding
and
abetting
larceny.
he
gave
ten
years
on
that
and
that
is
not
to
be
colored
by
the
fact
that
he
gave
mike
milanovich
five
years.
because
as
we
show
indicate
when
we
get
to
the
record
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
there
were
reasons,
substantial
ones,
as
to
her
participation
and
the
like.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
but
when
--
if
you
--
if
the
assumption
is
made
by
the
chief
justice
which
i
must
accept,
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
that
--
that
if
this
jury
instead
of
finding
guilt
of
aiding
and
abetting
larceny,
had
found
only
receiving,
i
am
not
sure
that
we're
permitted
to
assume
that
he
would
have
given
only
five
years,
simply
because
his
evaluation
of
the
total
of
what
she
should
receive
seem
to
have
been
ten
years,
on
the
offense
that
she
was
found
guilty
of.
and
i
don't
believe
that
we
are
--
that
we
are
or
that
we
need
to
speculate
as
to
what
he
would
have
given
on
that
count.
that
count
is
not
before
us.
that
has
been
wiped
out.
we
do
have
as
the
government
insists,
a
valid
count
on
aiding
and
abetting
larceny,
on
instructions
that
were
not
challenged
as
to
aiding
and
abetting,
and
as
i
--
i'll
try
to
show
briefly,
we're
very
carefully
separated
from
the
others
and
on
that,
his
valuation
was
ten
years.
and
the
reason
it
was
ten
years
instead
of
the
five
years
for
mike
milanovich,
appear
--
has
already
been
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
the
court
spoke
not
of
just
one
offense,
but
of
a
record
of
crimes
going
from
the
year
1926
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
to
1951.
we
don't
have
that
in
the
record,
but
that
is
what
he
had
before
and
but
we
have
statement
as
to
why
he
did
that.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
couldn't
speculate
on
that
at
all.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
we
haven't
--
we
do
have
the
assurance
that
--
that
he
felt
that
her
offenses
and
her
record
had
been
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
so
great
that
he
--
i
--
i
--
if
--
if
you
wish
to
my
speculation,
i
would've
say
he
would
have
given
her
ten
years
on
that
because
he
gave
his
five
years
on
receiving
in
the
full
knowledge
that
there
would
be
a
ten-year
sentence.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
and
if
--
if
the
chief
justice
wishes
me
to
speculate,
i
would
say
from
the
--
from
considerable
delving
into
this
record,
from
the
feeling
of
the
judge's
comments
throughout,
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
that
if
he
had
had
only
one
sentence
to
give,
he
would
have
given
ten
years,
on
receiving.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
do
not.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
an
impression
from
extensive
reading
in
the
record,
but
i
submit
to
the
court
will
cover
the
same
conclusion
when
they
see
how
she
was
entangled
in
this
matter
and
the
laboring
when
she
took
it
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
source
of
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
--
the
--
the
source
of
the
--
the
court's
power
was
the
only
one
of
these
was
invalid.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
i
--
i
still
must
dissent
from
that
word,
choose.
the
court
did
not
choose.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
court
wiped
out
one
count
and
one
verdict
that
was
invalid.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
because
the
five
was
on
the
invalid
count
on
verdict
and
pretend
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
the
receiving
count
was
invalid
on
the
court's
opinion
that
you
cannot
add
a
punishment
for
receiving.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no,
the
court
said
that
i
--
i
submit
the
contrary.
the
court
said
that
you
have
to
have
a
conviction
of
larceny
before
your
receiving
count
is
impugned.
and
the
reverse
is
not
true.
a
person
can
be
a
receiver
even
though
he
participated
in
the
larceny,
but
the
reverse
is
not
true.you
cannot
wipe
out
a
receiving
count
because
he
is
also
guilty
of
the
larceny.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
--
you
were
asked
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
correct.
the
choice
was
for
the
jury
and
it
was
left
to
the
jury.
the
jury
was
asked
to
find
the
facts.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
he
had
been
--
if
he
had
known
that
he
could
not
give
both
sentences,
i
--
i
explore
that
somewhat
with
the
chief
justice,
but
i
can
only
give
you
my
guess
--
best
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
--
what
could
he
have
done,
he
could
have
given
exactly
that
ten-year
sentence,
which
he
did.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
he
could've
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
if
he
had
been
advised
of
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
which
was
that
when
one
is
convicted
of
larceny
a
--
and
sentenced
for
that,
that
you
cannot
at
the
same
time,
punish
him
again
for
receiving.
if
he
had
been
advised
of
that
view,
then
there's
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
would've
acted
any
differently.
he
did
impose
a
sentence
on
the
valid
count
of
larceny
for
ten
years.
and
the
receiving
count
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
was
the
one
on
which
there
was
the
incorrect
instruction
and
if
that
was
wiped
out,
its
five-year
sentence
would've
been
wiped
out.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
not
the
large
one,
the
one
that
was
valid.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
the
instruction
on
the
receiving
count
is
what
is
valid
--
is
invalid.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
on
--
wrong
of
what?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
i
wouldn't
undertake
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
correct.
but
in
our
--
in
my
view
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
undertake
any
election
of
offenses
or
any
election
as
to
which
of
these
verdicts.
it
would
sustain.
it
felt
bound
by
heflin,
just
as
this
court
did
in
heflin.
the
receiving
could
not
be
of
sentence,
could
not
be
pyramided
and
it
was
error
for
that
receiving
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
as
to
--
as
to
what
--
could
it
have
been
imposed
under
this
evidence?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
has
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
correct.
but
if
they
had
brought
in
the
count
on
the
receiving
in
this
particular
case
on
the
instructions
that
were
given
here,
then
that
could
have
been
set
aside.
in
other
words,
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
--
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
this
is
the
instruction
that
was
invalid
with
respect
to
receiving
count.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
as
--
as
such.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
judge
speaking
of
the
receiving
count
stated
that,
it
states
a
separate
charge,
that
is,
that
these
defendants
did
unlawfully
receive
concealing
the
same.
now,
here
is
the
part
that
is
incorrect.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
--
i'm
quoting
now,
"now,
of
course,
if
they
had
actually
removed
the
contents
of
the
safe
themselves,
they
cannot
be
guilty
of
receiving
those
same
contents.
but
the
evidence
in
--
is
clear
in
this
case
that
neither
mike
milanovich
or
virginia
milanovich
actually
had
their
hands
on
the
safe
or
received
any
money
from
any
safe."
there
is
no
question
about
that.
so
therefore
and
here's
the
inaccuracy,
"if
they
received
any
money
and
i
do
not
suggest
that
they
did
or
did
not
receive
any
money,
they
must
have
--
they
must
have
received
it
from
some
other
party."
and
then
we
go
into
the
discussion
of
whether
they
received
with
intent
to
convert
to
their
own
use
or
gain.
that
is
where
the
--
the
district
court
departed
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
later
found
to
be
the
statutory
intent.
that
is
that
you
cannot
punish
the
person,
the
same
person
who
committed
the
larceny.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
she
waited
and
then
they
left
and
then
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
she
came
back
at
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
correct,
correct.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
--
i
would
state
that
you
are
more
firm
in
thinking
that
the
judge
did
--
then
i
stated
a
moment
ago,
that
the
judge
did
impose
this
ten
years
upon
the
entire
picture
that
was
before
him.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
believe
the
facts
do.
that
is
the
basis
of
my
response
to
the
chief
justice
to
the
effect
that
it
would
have
been
ten
years.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
believe,
your
honor,
on
the
record
as
to
his
reasons
given
for
the
totality
of
what
occurred
there.
his
reason
--
in
other
words,
what
disturbs
--
i
presume
what
is
disturbing
about
this
is
that
he
did
give
five
years
concurrent
sentence
on
the
receiving
count.
but
i
must
confess
that
i
am
not
as
disturb
by
that
because
he
did
that
not
as
he
would
have
treated
a
receiving
count
alone,
but
in
full
realization
that
there
would
be
ten
years
in
any
event.
and
if
--
i
--
i
must
again
answer
that
on
the
totality
of
the
picture,
if
we
were
to
consider
what
he
would
have
done
on
the
receiving
count
alone,
i
would
say
the
--
the
larger
sentence
would
have
been
imposed
on
that.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
my
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
i
believe
we
may
assume
that
legally
on
the
cases
which
we
site
in
our
brief
in
which
a
number
of
decisions
have
indicated
that
the
higher
sentence
is
selected
in
some
of
these
cases.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
jury
can
be
capricious,
we
may
assume
as
to
its
finding
of
facts,
but
after
it
has
found
the
fact
and
found
both
of
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
the
--
no.
the
--
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that
they
found
anything
inconsistent
as
a
matter
of
fact.
only
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts,
the
facts
on
both
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
i
--
i
can
only
repeat
their
--
their
decisions
on
that
which
we
have
cited
and
notably
the
audett
case
on
page
26
and
27
of
our
brief,
in
which
the
court
said,
"the
trial
judge
by
imposing
the
maximum
sentence
on
count
1
and
allowing
the
sentence
on
count
2
to
run
concurrently,
indicated
that
he
intended
the
maximum
sentence
to
be
20
years."
in
these
circumstances,
the
policy
followed
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
this
one
rules
out
and
this
will
solve
our
problem.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
well,
in
any
of
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
pardon?
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
as
i
understand
mr.
justice
black's
position,
at
the
most,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
it
should
be
returned
to
the
district
judge
to
impose
the
sentence
that
he
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
in
any
event,
this
discussion
as
i
understand
it
is
only
to
the
question
as
to
whether
it
should
be
sent
back
for
resentencing.
we
insist
of
course
that
--
that
there
was
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
nothing
beyond
that
to
the
extent
of
a
new
trial.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no.
and
while
we
are
on
that,
since
the
court
appears
so
interested
in
the
--
the
question
of
the
--
the
receiving
and
concealing
as
against
the
--
the
larceny
charge,
we
of
course,
take
a
strong
issue
as
i
had
hope
to
develop
and
we'll
review
of
the
evidence
here
with
the
statement
that
the
--
that
there
was
greater
strength
for
the
receiving
count
in
the
evidence
than
there
was
for
the
larceny.
we
don't
find
that
true
at
all.
we
do
not
find
true
that
there
was
no
cooperation
because
in
--
in
many
respects
for
instance,
the
sentries
at
the
--
at
the
naval
station,
though
that
appears
in
our
brief,
corroborated
these
stories
that
the
--
in
many
respects
here.
for
instance,
virginia
milanovich
herself,
in
--
in
the
statement
she
made
to
the
fbi
as
contrasted
with
her
final
testimony,
gave
valid
ground
to
the
jury
for
finding
her
as
guilty
of
aiding
and
abetting
in
this
larceny,
as
in
the
other
matters.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
i
can.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that's
right.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
cited
the
audett
case
in
our
brief
on
page
27.
that
was
where
i
read
that
quote.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
page
27
of
our
brief.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
27
of
our
brief,
the
government
brief.
well,
it's
the
case
about
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
audett
versus
united
states.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
as
i
recalled
the
audett
case,
which
was
265
f.2d
837,
certiorari
denied,
361
united
states
815.
as
i
recall
that
case,
i
don't
have
the
facts
of
all
of
these
in
mind
at
the
time.
and
there
--
when
you
--
when
the
--
when
the
statement
is
made
precisely
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
we
need
to
safeguard
the
fact
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
some
come
up
on
--
no,
i
mean
some
come
up
on
reversal
on
--
on
suggested
reversal
of
sentence,
some
of
them
come
up
collaterally.
but
basically,
the
audett
case,
as
i
recall
it,
is
one
such
and
--
and
the
remainder
of
those
cases
on
page
26
of
the
government
brief
also,
(inaudible),
williamson,
leather
and
audett.
and
the
cases
cited
within
those
cases,
i
recall,
i
maybe
in
error
here,
but
i
recall
a
number
of
cases
cited
by
them
to
the
same
effect
and
that
is
that
they
seek
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
the
trial
judge,
if
that
can
be
reasonably
obtained.
perhaps,
it's
no
more
than
the
speculation
that
i
was
asked
to
make
here,
but
they
do
act
upon
that
and
i
think
fairly
and
legally.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
speaking
in
any
absolute
sense,
your
--
there
is
no
absolute
way
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
there
is
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
no.
i
can
only
answer
that
the
courts
have
sought
to
finish
these
cases
and
where
the
record
has
indicated
to
them,
the
reasoning
or
the
basis
for
the
court
--
for
the
trial
judge's
sentence
as
is
extremely
pronounced
here
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
--
that
that
has
been
done.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
the
harm
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
i
can
only
say
that
here,
at
least,
the
judge
evaluated
the
sentence
that
did
the
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
correct.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
that
is
my
point.
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
my
answer
is
--
mr.
j.
f.
bishop
my
answer
is
that
we
don't
necessarily
assume
that
as
an
invariable
rule,
but
that
we
have
considerable
authority
for
the
judge
finishing
--
for
the
court
finishing
the
job,
where
there
is
an
indication
of
the
trial
judge's
intent.
