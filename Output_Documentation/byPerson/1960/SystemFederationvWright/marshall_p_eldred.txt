mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
let
me
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
release
which
counsel
mentioned
as
being
not
sure
whether
it
was
in
the
record
is
in
the
record.
it
begins
at
page
138
and
continues
through
--
through
page
144.
as
you
were
allude
to
that
release
in
a
few
moments
from
now,
if
i
may
proceed
with
what
i
deemed
to
be
--
should
be
said
first
to
this
court
and
an
orderly
presentation
of
the
reasons
the
respondents
have
for
affirmance
of
the
decisions
below.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
we
should
determine
what
requirements
for
modification
of
an
injunction
are,
necessarily
saw
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
facts
in
this
case
bring
us
within
permissive
modification.
well,
of
course
the
leading
case
on
that
subject
is
the
case
decided
by
this
court,
the
swift
case,
and
this
court
has
clearly
said
in
the
swift
decision
that
the
requirement
for
modification
is
that
there
must
be
a
clear
showing
of
grievous
wrong
that
must
be
shown
by
the
movement
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
conditions.
secondly,
we
wished
to
point
out
that
the
courts
have
held
at
modification
must
effectuate
and
not
what
the
purpose
of
the
original
decree.
in
the
next
place,
we
desire
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that,
as
already
mentioned,
that
modification
under
rule
60
(b)
is
addressed
to
the
sound
legal
discretion
of
the
court
and
is
not
to
be
disturbed
except
for
an
abuse
of
that
discretion.
it
is
our
position
that
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
have
failed
to
show
any
abuse
of
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
in
order
to
point
that
out,
i
think
we
should
briefly
analyze
what
the
district
court
held
when
he
denied
the
motion
to
modify
the
injunction
in
this
case.
the
district
court
recognized
his
continuing
authority
to
modify
the
injunctions
not
withstanding
the
consent
nature
of
the
decree.
he
recognized
that
authority
--
his
authority
continuing
to
modify
under
the
formulae
setup
by
this
court
in
the
swift
case.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
1951
amendment,
which
is
the
sole
reliance
of
petitioners
in
this
case
for
modification
for
1951
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act
which
is
section
211
of
that
act
was
permissive
only
and
the
district
court
concluded
that
on
the
basis
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
hanson
case.
secondly,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
railway
labor
act
leaves
the
railroad
and
the
unions
at
liberty
to
agree
that
a
union
shop
shall
not
prevail.
he
concluded
that
there
was
such
an
agreement
in
this
case
namely
that
a
union
shop
should
not
prevail
and
that
that
agreement
underlie
the
decree
issued
originally
in
this
case.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
that
is
the
agreement,
that's
the
parties
reach
--
the
understanding
that
the
parties
reached
when
this
case
will
settle.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes
sir.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
that
is
shown
in
the
release
which
the
28th
named
plaintiffs
executed
on
december
the
1st,
1945.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
that
appears
on
page
138
of
the
record.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
this
provision
if
your
honor
please,
the
premises
refer
to
the
filing
of
the
suit.
then
it
refers
to
the
fact
that
it
is
the
mutual
desire
of
all
the
parties
to
the
action
to
settle
and
dispose
of
all
the
issues
in
dispute.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
in
the
--
of
page
138
of
the
record.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
they
agreed
to
settle
and
dispose
of
all
the
issues
and
dispute
in
the
following
manner,
one,
the
entering
of
a
consent
decree
and
the
forth
said
actions,
the
purpose
of
which
will
be
to
protect
the
undersigned
against
any
future
acts
of
practices
of
or
by
the
defendants
which
will
deny
to
the
undersigned
any
of
their
rights
and
benefits
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
now
in
effect
are
which
may
hereafter
be
entered
into,
in
accordance
with
the
railway
labor
act
find
between
the
l&n
and
system
federation
91
a
copy
of
which
consent
decree
is
a
test
here
too.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
the
1951
act
merely
made
it
permissive.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
we
say
that
since
the
amendment
is
permissive
only
that
an
agreement
now
not
to
have
a
union
shop
is
legal
under
the
amendment.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
it
was
legal
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
if
they
have
an
agreement
not
to
have
a
union
shop?
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
oh
no,
no
it
would
not
be
illegal.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
well,
then
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
exactly.
precisely.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
no
sir.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
and
contractor.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
it
was
in
this
sense
of
the
word.
the
unions
did
not
--
did
not
have
to
go
to
the
extent
of
agreeing
that
there
would
be
no
union
shop
because
the
law
for
better
union
shop,
the
railway
labor
act
did
that
at
that
time.
all
that
was
necessary
for
the
unions
to
have
done
in
this
consent
decree
since
evidently,
they
did
not
want
to
take
the
issues
to
the
court
in
the
trial,
was
simply
to
do
what
is
done
in
--
for
example
fair
labor
standard
act
cases.
simply
consent
that
they
will
not
violate
the
law,
consent
that
they
will
no
longer
discriminate
against
the
non-union
employees.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
precisely.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
exactly.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
because
the
unions
went
farther
than
they
were
--
were
required
to
go.
they
had
a
choice
in
this
matter.
they
had
--
they
could've
said,
"we
will
no
longer
discriminate
against
non-union
employees
in
connection
with
seeing
that
they
get
their
employment
benefits."
but
they
went
farther
than
that
and
they
said
that
now
are
in
the
future.
now,
if
you
will
look
at
the
injunction
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
by
reason
of
their
failure
to
join
or
maintain
membership
in
the
union,
at
that
time
of
course,
the
railway
labor
act
forbad
the
union
shop.
now,
they're
saying
here
that
in
view
of
giving
up
certain
rights
than
we
have
in
this
lawsuit
and
in
order
to
settle
all
our
issues,
we
agree
that
the
non-union
employees
on
the
l&n
railroad
in
the
six
shop
crest
shall
not
be
required
to
join
or
maintain
membership
in
the
union
under
any
bargaining
agreement
now
in
effect,
of
course
you
didn't
need
it
because
the
act
forbad
it
then
are
hereafter
in
effect
in
accordance
with
the
railway
labor
act.
now,
that
could
only
mean
one
thing
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
no
matter
how
much
the
amended
here.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
and
i'll
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
i
think
they
said
it
very
well
indeed
if
you
will
look
at
the
language
of
the
decree
and
you
remember
that
a
copy
of
this
degree
--
decree
was
attached
to
the
release,
a
week
before
the
decree
was
ever
entered.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
i'm
not
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
i'm
not
that
all
sure
that
was
necessary
to
show
in
the
action.
what
we
do
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
was
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
it
was
well.
it
was
because
two
years
before
this
suit
was
filed
in
1945
and
in
1943,
the
unions
had
made
a
demand
upon
the
l&n
and
other
railroads
for
a
certain
wage
increases
and
a
union
shop
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
it's
railway
labor
act
at
that
time
for
better
union
shop.
the
dispute
was
so
serious
that
it
was
referred
to
a
presidential
emergency
board.
the
mulholland
firm
of
toledo,
ohio
which
is
the
firm
representing
the
unions
today,
participated
in
that
hearing
before
the
emergency
board.
and
mr.
willard
h.
mcewen
was
before
that
board.
he
was
also
one
of
counsel
for
the
unions
when
we
filed
this
case
in
1945
and
took
discovered
deposition
before
this
decree
was
agreed
upon.
before
the
emergency
board,
mr.
mcewen
and
other
counsel
representing
the
unions
advanced
the
contention
that
even
then,
under
the
railway
labor
act
as
it
existed,
the
unions
were
entitled
to
a
union
shop
but
they
made
the
argument
that
it
more
expedient
that
the
emergency
board
should
recommend
to
the
congress
that
the
railway
labor
act
be
amended
so
that
they
could
have
a
union
shop.
and
that
the
fact
the
notice
given
to
the
carriers
was
to
grab
a
union
shop,
and
that
was
two
years
before
this
suit,
and
two
years
before
this
agreement
was
entered
into
by
the
very
counsel
who
was
representing
the
--
these
unions
before
the
presidential
emergency
board.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
no,
sir.
it
has
been
contemplated
by
the
unions
for
heaven
knows
how
long.
and
it
was
only
after
building
pressure
up
constantly
against
congress
that
congress
finally
made
up
its
mind,
"we
will
permit.
we
will
never
require.
we
will
permit
to
carry
within
the
unions
to
enter
into
a
union
shop
brief."
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
it
was
issued,
mr.
justice,
because
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
there
was
discrimination
which
the
railway
labor
act
forbade
under
this
court's
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
it
could
do
so.
suppose
now,
this
act
--
the
--
i
mean
this
suit,
the
original
litigation
had
arisen
after
1951,
which
was
the
date
of
the
amendments.
pick
out
a
railroad,
said
the
xyz
railroad
where
no
union
shop
prevail.
suppose
as
in
this
case,
the
union
in
that
case
was
not
permitting
non-union
employees
to
get
fair
share
of
employment,
rights
and
benefits.
suppose
the
suit
had
been
filed
asking
for
declaration
of
rights
and
for
an
injunction
against
that
discrimination
and
for
damages
for
the
loss
of
wages
that
the
non-union
employees
had
suffered.
suppose
the
parties
had
gotten
together
and
said,
"we
will
settle
all
the
issues
in
this
litigation."
and
among
other
things,
we're
going
to
agree
that
there
will
be
no
union
shop
now,
under
the
--
under
the
provision
for
the
railway
labor
act
as
it
exist
or
in
the
future
under
the
railway
labor
act
as
it
may
then
exist.
that
agreement
could
be
executed.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes.
i
was
--
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
a
moment
ago
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
that
maybe
zeal
of
advocacy
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
but
mr.
justice
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
first,
on
the
middle
paragraph
of
page
7,
we
have
the
declaration
of
rights
that
the
non-union
employees
be
entitled
irrespective
and
without
regard
to
whether
said
employees
or
any
of
them
were
members
or
join
or
retain
membership
in
any
of
the
defendant
labor
organizations
or
in
any
labor
organization.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred

mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
that's
right.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
because
they
are
not
--
they
will
--
the
unions
and
the
railroad
are
not
to
require
union
membership
as
a
tradition
preceding
to
employment
benefits
under
a
bargaining
agreement
which
was
then
in
effect
are
which
may
hereafter
be
in
effect
in
accordance
with
the
railway
labor
act.
even
though,
and
it's
implied
in
there
until
notice
bailed
out,
even
though
the
railway
labor
act
be
subsequently
amended
to
permit
a
union
shop.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
1945.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
they're
able
to
have
it.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
right.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
correct.
now,
there
must
be
a
grievous
wrong
which
results
--
now,
simply,
a
change
in
the
law
which
permits
a
union
shop
agreement
is
not
sufficient,
because
the
unions
have
not
shown
under
your
swift
formula
that
this
decree
results
in
a
grievous
wrong
to
them,
nor
have
they
shown
that
that
grievous
wrong
was
evoked
by
new
and
unforeseen
circumstances.
i
think
i've
already
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
--
it
was
not
a
new
and
unforeseen
circumstance,
the
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act
because
the
unions
knew
two
years
before
and
were
trying
their
best
to
get
a
union
shop
on
a
railroad
and
had
sought
to
have
a
recommendation
come
from
a
presidential
emergency
board
that
congress
amend
the
act
and
forbid
a
union
shop
agreement.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
on
page
77
of
the
record.
the
court
concluded
that
the
railway
labor
act
leaves
the
railroad
and
the
unions
at
liberty
to
agree
that
a
union
shop
shall
not
prevail,
and
then
immediately
after
that
that
there
was
such
an
agreement
which
underlay
the
decree
of
december
the
7th,
1945.
and
the
court
further,
on
page
78
of
the
record,
concluded
that,
"under
the
railway
labor
act
as
it
then
existed
forbidding
a
union
shop,
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
unions
to
agree
to
that
but
that
they
went
farther
than
they
were
required
to
do
in
order
to
agree
that
no
union
shop
would
prevail."
then
the
court
--
district
court
goes
on
to
find
that
the
change
of
law
alone
is
not
sufficient,
because
it
does
not
result
in
any
grievous
wrong
to
the
unions,
resulting
for
new
and
unforeseen
circumstances.
the
unions
have
not
met
the
burden
of
proof
which
this
court,
in
the
ford
case,
said,
"is
upon
the
movement
in
an
effort
to
modify
an
injunction."
now,
the
only
thing
the
--
the
union
has
shown
is
simply
on
a
member
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
permits
the
parties
but
doesn't
require
it."
the
unions
in
effect,
argue
that
the
amendment
to
the
railway
labor
act
compels
a
union
shop
agreement.
mr.

motion
to
modify.
that
brings
us
down
today.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
well
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
well,
we
can't
come
to
any
of
the
conclusions.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
we
can't
come
to
any
of
the
conclusion
because
that
is
the
only
reason
at
best
by
them
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
to
show
that
the
decree
is
a
grievous
wrong.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
well,
you
say
voluntary
arrangements.
the
parties
who
benefits,
this
agreement
was
made,
gave
up
substantial
rights.
there
were
28
plaintiffs
for
example
who
alleged
damages
in
the
sum
of
$5000
each,
for
a
total
of
$145,000
which
they
gave
up
for
a
forfeit
settlement
of
$5000
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
as
part
of
this
overall
settlement.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
no,
sir.
it
did
not.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
they
could
know
--
they
couldn't
continue
to
discriminate,
that's
true.
they
could
not
discriminate.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
well,
they
have
union
responsibility
whether
they
have
a
union
shop
or
not.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes,
yes.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
that's
of
course
the
position
we
take
it,
we
have
this
right.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
correct.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
that
is
right.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
right.
but
we
can
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
of
course.
no
railroad
today
can
withstand
the
economic
sanctions
of
the
strike.
railroads
are
having
difficult
time
enough
as
it
is.
it
certainly
could
not
withstand
that.
the
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
this
agreement
and
i
do
emphasize
because
there
was
an
understanding.
and
the
consent
decree
which
had
been
worked
up
referring
to
bargaining
agreements
in
effect
now
or
which
maybe
in
effect
under
the
railway
labor
act
hereafter.
that
agreement
was
lawful
then
it's
lawful
today.
now,
the
only
reason
that
the
unions
advanced
to
modify
the
injunction
is
that
they're
now
permitted
to
do
it
but
they
can't
by
their
own
agreement.
we
do
not
say
that
the
injunction
in
this
case
can
never
be
modified.
we
say
that
the
question
whether
it
can
ever
be
modified
is
not
before
the
court
on
this
record.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
yes.
yes,
sir.
in
the
first
place,
my
clients,
when
this
suit
was
originally
filed
and
when
we
settled
the
issues,
gave
up
rights
to
prove
substantial
damages.
all
of
the
members
of
the
class
represented
by
the
named
plaintiffs
could
have
under
procedure,
appropriate
procedure,
have
intervened
and
proven
damages
to
a
large
extent.
it
became
generally
known
among
the
classes
represented
by
the
28
named
plaintiffs
in
the
original
action
that
this
agreement
had
been
reached,
that
no
union
shop
would
be
required
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
then
or
in
the
future.
five
years
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
a
contract
not
in
hiding.
so
they
have
--
they
lost
all
those.
now,
this
is
an
agreement
fairly
reached
and
until
the
railroad
--
i
mean,
until
the
unions
prove
that
it's
an
instrument
of
oppression
to
them
and
they
haven't
shown
that
in
this
case.
they
--
they
refer
to
the
pro
rata
arguments.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
they
referred
to
laws
or
revenue
which
had
no
equitable
reason.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
in
addition
to
what
i
have
said,
they
are
opposed
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
to
compulsory
unionism.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
because
they
feel
that
it's
against
their
principles.
they
believe
that
a
union
should
carry
its
own
weight
that
if
it
properly
represents
the
employees,
its
own
persuasion
will
lead
to
union
membership,
that
they
should
not
--
the
--
the
employees
should
not
be
compelled
against
their
will,
particularly
when
they
took
pains
to
agree
with
these
unions
15
years
ago,
that
they
would
not
be
compelled
against
them.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
well,
they
--
they
could
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
no.
that's
--
that's
alright
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
a
matter
of
principle
with
them.
it's
a
matter
that
they
do
not
want
to
be
members
of
the
union.
they
do
not
want
to
have
to
pay
tribute
to
a
union
--
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
--
and
have
that
money
used
for
purposes
to
which
they
are
opposed.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
well,
that
maybe
part
of
it
or
--
but
it's
not
the
whole
picture.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
there
were
both.
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
original
plaintiffs
left?
mr.
marshall
p.
eldred
about
eight
of
the
28
but
we
had
a
great
many
interveners.
