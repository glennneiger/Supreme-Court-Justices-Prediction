mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
case
who
are
a
group
of
railroad
labor
organizations,
commonly
referred
to
as
shop
craft
unions
as
well
as
some
of
their
subsidiary
component
local
unions
who
were
enjoined
along
with
the
respondent
louisville
&
nashville
railroad
company
some
15
years
ago
from
discriminating
against
a
group
of
non-union
plaintiffs
with
respect
to
affording
those
plaintiffs'
full
and
equal
enjoyment
of
all
of
the
rights
given
to
them
and
other
employees
in
their
respective
crafts,
under
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
were
negotiated
between
this
petitioner
organizations
in
the
railroad
company.
we
are
now
here
seeking
for
reversal
of
decisions
of
the
courts
below
which
refuse
to
modify
that
old
injunction
to
the
extent
of
permitting
us
to
ask
the
railroad
to
execute
a
union
shop,
union
security
agreement
with
this
petitioner
labor
organizations
as
bargaining
representatives.
the
type
of
agreement
we
sought
to
negotiate
of
course
is
the
type
that
was
authorized
by
the
1951
amendments
to
railway
labor
act
which
came
along
some
six
years
after
this
old
injunction
was
issued
and
which
subject
to
enumerated
safeguards,
did
authorize
union
security
agreements
in
the
railroad
industry
which
had
previous
had
been
an
open
shop
industry.
and
this
court
is
very
familiar
with
that
in
view
of
the
decision
in
the
hanson
case
which
was
the
first
time
that
those
1951
amendments
had
been
held
to
be
constitutional.
we
petition
for
modification
of
this
injunction
in
accordance
with
rule
60
(b)
subparagraph
5
under
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
authorizes
modification
of
an
injunction
in
its
prospective
application
when
circumstances
have
so
changed
as
to
make
it
inequitable
for
the
injunction
to
be
continued
in
an
effect
--
in
effect
in
its
original
form.
what
we
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
appears
at
page
14
of
our
brief
your
honor,
our
original
brief.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
what
we
asked
the
courts
to
do
was
not
to
vacate
the
injunction,
not
to
open
the
door
to
any
unlawful
discrimination
against
these
original
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class,
but
simply
to
give
us
a
pro
tanto
modification.
so
that
the
injunction
which
at
time
of
its
issuance
had
declared
and
protected
plaintiffs'
rights
under
the
railway
labor
act
as
it
existed
at
that
time
would
now
be
modified
so
that
it
would
protect
the
rights
of
these
plaintiffs
and
their
class
under
the
railway
labor
act
in
its
present
form.
and
we
sought
and
obtained
a
review
by
this
court
on
three
questions
that
we
urged
that
were
involved,
three
points
in
which
we
stated
that
the
courts
below
aired
in
the
decision
that
they
reached.
first
of
all,
the
courts
concluded,
both
the
district
court
and
the
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
primarily
a
paraphrasing
of
the
decision
and
reasoning
of
the
district
court,
the
courts
concluded
first
that
the
amendment
of
the
railway
labor
act
is
so
as
to
permit
union
shop
agreements,
which
had
previously
been
unlawful,
was
not
a
sufficient
change
in
circumstances
as
to
justify
removing
this
injunctive
prohibition
against
our
negotiating
such
agreements.
then
they
also
ruled
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
original
decree
of
an
injunction
had
been
a
consent
decree
rather
than
a
decree
written
by
the
court
following
a
complete
trial
and
litigation
of
the
old
suit.
therefore,
we
must
be
deemed
to
have
agreed
with
this
original
plaintiff's
and
their
class
that
never
at
anytime
in
the
future
would
we
ever
negotiate
a
union
shop
agreement.
so
the
courts
below
both
fell
into
the
error
that
this
court
come
in
to
(inaudible)
swift
case
of
treating
the
consent
decree
as
a
contract
rather
than
as
a
judicial
act.
and
third,
both
courts
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes
your
honor,
and
of
course
in
the
swift
case,
this
court
discussed
that
concept
in
considerable
length.
and
third,
both
of
the
courts
below
give
such
comments
in
their
opinions
to
evidence
submitted
over
the
objections
of
the
moving
parties,
the
petitioners
here
that
--
that
we
must
consider
that
they
give
weight
to
it
and
--
and
give
it
effect
in
refusing
to
modify
injunction.
that
evidence
was
to
the
effect
that
as
a
result
of
an
economic
strike
on
the
louisville
&
nashville
railroad
in
1955,
they
remain
a
great
deal
of
bitterness
and
hostility
among
the
employees
of
the
railroad
and
the
evidence
showed
that
these
petitioner
organizations
had
find
and
expelled
members
who
worked
during
the
strike.
the
l
&
m
claim
that
2500
of
these
employees
stayed
at
work
during
the
strike.
and
now,
they
came
in
this
proceeding
to
modify
the
old
injunction
to
permit
us
and
negotiate
a
union
shop
and
urged
that
because
there
was
this
antipathy
among
the
employee
groups,
which
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
original
injunction
against
discrimination
in
the
enjoinment
of
contract
rights,
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
union
shop
agreement
but
was
simply
bitterness
in
strike
out
of
--
between
strikers
and
strike
breakers
that
this
should
be
construed
as
holding
us
without
clean
hands
and
hence
not
entitled
to
negotiate
the
union
shop
agreement.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes
your
honor
that
--
judge
sherburne's
opinion
appears
at
page
69
of
the
record.
it's
--
it
goes
from
page
69
to
page
80.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
have
in
mind
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
that
was
charged
in
the
original
complaint,
it
illustrates
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
so-called
bitterness
or
hostility.
what
these
plaintiffs
originally
complaining
about
was
the
fact
that
the
non-union
employees
they
alleged
had
been
--
had
been
denied
equal
opportunities
for
promotions
from
one
category
of
employment
to
another,
had
been
denied
their
fair
share
of
overtime
assignments,
and
had
been
denied
certain
attributes
of
their
seniority
status,
all
claim
to
be
governed
by
the
contracts
between
the
company
and
the
organization
in
certain
matters
such
as
picking
man
to
be
temporarily
upgraded
from
helper
to
a
temporary
mechanics
job
or
in
assigning
men
to
be
called
for
overtime
in
particular
jobs.
there
is
discretion
that's
exercised
by
a
local
foreman
and
a
local
union
committee
in
deciding
who
they
think
to
be
the
best
man
to
be
upgraded.
and
that
was
the
gist
of
this
original
action.
there
was
no
question
of
a
union
shop
agreement
back
in
1945.
but
this
court
just
prior
of
entry
of
this
consent
decree,
had
decided
the
landmark
steele
and
tunstall
cases
which
contained
a
complete
and
new
to
all
of
us
exposition
of
the
statutory
fiduciary
duty
of
bargaining
agents
and
the
carriers
under
the
railway
labor
act
not
to
join
in
discriminating
against
members
of
the
class
representative.
now
up
until
the
steele
and
tunstall
cases
were
decided
of
course
the
--
as
this
court
knows
from
having
reversed
both
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
there
was
a
quite
a
body
of
authority
relied
upon
by
many
course
to
the
affect
that
you
couldn't
maintain
a
lawsuit
based
on
discrimination
which
was
joined
in
by
the
company
and
the
union.
but,
when
these
cases
were
decided,
there
was
no
longer
any
point
in
litigating
this
lawsuit
on
the
original
complaint
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
create
any
precedent.
the
precedent
was
there
for
us,
this
courts
opinion
in
the
steele
and
tunstall
cases
practically
wrote
the
form
of
our
consent
decree
force.
but
then
when
we
came
along
after
the
railroad
labor
act
was
amended
as
to
permit
a
union
shop
agreement,
the
railroad
suddenly
said,
"do
as,
well,
we
won't
sign
that
agreement
with
you
because
somebody
is
going
to
hold
us
some
contempt
of
this
old
decree
that
says
we
can't
discriminate
based
on
non-membership
in
the
union."
so,
that's
was
this
case
is
about
and
that's
what
precipitated
this
motion
to
modify
the
injunction.
now,
probably
one
of
the
most
basic
concepts
on
modification
of
injunctions
is
it
in
--
in
injunction
does
not
create
a
right
but
simply
furnishes
the
protection,
a
remedy
for
the
protection
of
a
right
which
must
find
its
source
some
place
else.
in
this
case,
the
source
of
the
right
asserted
in
the
original
complaint
was
the
railway
labor
act.
it
was
the
statutory
fiduciary
duty
defined
by
this
court
in
the
steele
and
tunstall
cases.
now,
our
position
to
support
of
the
modification
and
the
injunction
is
quite
simple,
these
rights
stems
from
the
statute.
the
statute
has
now
been
amended
so
as
to
change
the
nature
of
the
right.
and
if
we
don't
have
the
injunction
modified
to
conform
to
this
change,
we're
confronted
with
the
situation
of
these
petitioners
continuing
under
threat
of
this
injunction,
under
panic
contempt
proceedings
for
violating
it,
continuing
to
be
prohibited
from
negotiating
agreements
which
congress
has
said
in
these
words,
"they
shall
be
permitted
to
negotiate."
and
the
original
plaintiffs
and
the
people
that
have
been
intervened
in
these
more
recent
proceedings
would
be
continued
to
be
protected,
would
continue
to
have
this
injunctive
remedy
for
the
protection
of
a
right
which
is
no
longer
in
existence.
and
of
course
aside
from
the
inequity
of
being
prohibited
from
engaging
in
con
--
conduct
which
is
lawful
and
which
congress
said
it
is
desirable
now
for
national
public
policy
in
the
railroad
industry
to
prevent
free
riders
to
require
employees
to
bear
their
fair
share
or
the
cost
of
burden
--
the
cost
in
the
burden
of
collective
bargaining.
in
addition
to
--
to
just
the
inequity
of
being
prohibited
from
doing
something
that
you
have
a
legal
right
to
do,
there
is
of
course
the
additional
very
substantial
financial
consideration
that's
involved
in
which
these
petitioners
are
seeking
the
right
to
enjoy.
we
have
by
railroads
argument
in
this
brief,
i
believe
this
claim
that
2500
employees
work
during
the
strike
and
that
everybody
that
work
doing
the
strike
was
expelled
from
the
union
or
was
not
a
member
of
the
union
to
begin
with.
but
we
took
a
very
small
figure
for
the
amount
of
dues
income
that
would
be
lost
by
these
organizations
as
a
result
of
being
kept
under
this
injunction.
i
suspect
a
very
conservative
estimate
what
the
dues
lost
would
be
if
you
would
assume
1%
of
an
employer's
monthly
earnings
for
--
for
his
monthly
dues.
i
suppose
you
have
between
$100,000
to
$200,000
to
this
lawsuit
dues
to
these
group
of
petitioners
so,
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
petitioners
are
not
suffering
any
particular
inequity
or
in
any
particular
wrong
or
not
hurting
from
the
continuously
injunction.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
don't
know
what
your
honor
means,
but
--
but
types
---
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
that
was
a
racial
discrimination
case.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
that
was
a
racial
discrimination
case.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
and
assuming
in
that
they
were
a
members
of
different
crafts,
they
were
operating
crafts
and
the
shop
crafts.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well
they
--
they
are
--
sorry,
the
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
is
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
they
can
be.
and
we
would
very
much
like
to
be
able
to
require
them
to
join
and
to
make
their
contributions
to
the
overall
cost
to
collective
bargaining.
now,
there
is
one
point
that
and
one
only
that
runs
through
all
of
the
briefs
of
the
respondents,
both
the
respondent,
railroad
company
and
the
individual
employee
response.
that
is
this
idea
of
an
agreement,
an
agreement
to
the
agreement.
they
don't
speak
of
the
decree.
they
speak
of
the
decree
and
the
agreement.
and
they
give
the
impression
they
try
to
give
the
impression
in
their
briefs
as
they
seem
to
have
succeeded
in
doing
with
the
district
court
that
this
was
not
an
ordinary
kind
of
a
consent
decree
of
injunction
but
it
was
something
a
little
unusual.
the
say
that
we
agreed
in
some
kind
of
a
tripartite
agreement
between
the
plaintiffs,
the
company
and
the
unions
that
there
would
be
never
be
a
union
security
agreement
negotiated
on
this
property.
the
fact
is
there
is
no
such
agreement
and
we
challenge
counsel
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
we've
done
it
here
to
point
to
any
place
in
the
record
where
there
is
such
agreement.
we
have
further
demonstrated
that
by
reference
to
their
own
briefs,
that
when
press,
what
they
say
is
that
the
decree
was
the
agreement.
and
they
say
that
by
the
act
of
settling
the
case
by
a
consent
decree
therefore,
we
must
by
some
magical
method
be
assumed
to
have
entered
into
some
implied
agreement.
we
would
not
ever
negotiate
the
union
shop
agreement.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no,
the
district
court
said
he
had
power
to
modify
the
injunction
but
then
he
cons
--
construed
this
consent
decree
as
i've
said
as
being
a
contract,
an
agreement,
strictly
contradiction
to
what
this
court
has
so
plainly
and
clearly
stated
in
the
swift
case.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes
--
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
not
that
we
would
never
seek
a
modification.
he
said
that
we
must
be
held
to
have
agreed
that
we
would
never
attempt
to
negotiate
a
union
shop.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
and
we
didn't
agree
to
that.
what
we
did,
we
agreed
to
an
injunction
to
the
entry
of
a
consent
decree
of
an
injunction
enjoining
us
from
this
broad
range
of
discrimination.
there
is
no
side
agreement.
there
is
no
covenant
undesirable.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
court
retain
jurisdiction
expressly
in
the
injunction.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
page
36
of
the
record
your
honor.
page
38,
the
bottom
of
the
page,
the
court
says,
"the
court
retains
control
of
this
act
to
the
purpose
of
entering
such
further
orders
has
may
be
became
necessary
or
proper."
and
of
course
as
we
have
pointed
out,
under
rule
60
of
the
federal
rules,
the
court
expressly
possesses
that
far
with
or
without
reservation,
it's
also
part
of
the
general
principles
of
equity
to
jurisprudence
even
before
the
rule
was
spelled
out
and
that
clearly,
the
court
does
posses
its
power.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
mr.
justice
black
if
--
if
such
a
contract
rather
than
the
railway
labor
act
were
the
basis
for
the
court's
order
of
injunction,
the
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction
under
the
norris-laguardia
act.
he
--
he
couldn't
base
his
--
his
decree
on
a
contract.
he
had
to
be
enforcing
the
obligation
of
the
statute
because
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
graham
case,
this
was
made
very
clear
that
this
discrimination
case
didn't
wipe
out
norris-laguardia
and
that
unless
the
plaintiff
were
speaking
to
enforce
some
positive
mandate
of
the
railway
labor
act
in
one
of
these
injunction
suits.
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
prevent
the
issuance
for
an
injunction.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
that
is
all
the
evidence
through
this.
the
parties
entered
into
a
release
or
by
the
plaintiffs
released
their
claims
for
back
damages
upon
the
payment
by
defendants
of
$5000
and
second,
the
defendants
agreed
to
the
entry
of
a
consent
decree
which
decree
appears
at
page
36
and
that
is
all
or
there
is.
there
is
no
other
agreement.
there's
been
no
effort
made.
the
point
to
any
other
agreement
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
except
to
say
that
this
must
be
construed
as
cascading
one.
when
they
argued
for
it,
they
don't
say
here's
the
agreement
at
page
such
and
such
of
the
record.
they
simply
argue
in
this
very
well.
this
decree
of
injunction
didn't
come
from
the
air.
it
had
to
come
from
some
place
so
therefore
there
must
have
been
an
agreement
and
yet,
they
and
the
court
of
appeals
below
said
that
the
decree
wasn't
--
the
decree
became
the
agreement.
so,
what
they're
doing,
they're
electing
the
--
to
the
decree
as
the
source
for
some
implied
agreement.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
at
page
152
on
the
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
sentence
of
sentence
of
the
--
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
court
says,
"when
the
injunction
was
issued?
the
parties
herein
by
their
consent
thereto
provided
that
no
such
requirement
of
union
membership
should
there
have
to
be
in
effect
in
any
bargaining
agreement."
they're
looking
to
the
consent
decree
as
to
the
description
and
definition
and
source
of
this
theoretical
outside
--
side
separate
covenant
or
agreement.
and
the
fact
of
course
is
that
the
procedure
that
was
followed
in
settling
this
lawsuit
by
the
answer
that
consent
decree
was
precisely
the
same
as
you
will
find
in
any
case
where
there's
a
consent
decree
of
an
injunction.
and
if
we
hold
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
consent
natures
the
decree
bars
us
on
some
agreement
theory
then
it
would
be
equally
--
it
would
equally
bar
modification
of
an
injunction
in
any
case
where
the
injunction
was
by
consent.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
court
of
appeals
as
they
have
a
counsel
for
response
and
as
i
recollect,
he
said
he
did
claim
it
was
in
perpetuity.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no,
it
was
the
separate
release
but
i
don't
recall
whether
that
release
was
ever
entered
into
the
record
in
this
case.
it's
referred
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
to
in
the
brief
for
respondents
so
that
other
than
l
&
n,
however
and
i
have
no
--
no
particular
quarrel
with
their
statement
of
facts
as
to
the
nature
and
scope
of
--
of
what
the
settlement
consisted
of
it.
it
starts
at
page
5
and
goes
around
page
6
of
the
brief
of
counsel
for
respondents
other
than
the
l
&
n.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
there
was
no
agreement
but
they
could
have
referral.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
what
is
in
the
brief
is
not
an
agreement
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
is
--
it
is
a
release.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
court
--
the
court
did
have
that
before
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
not
and
--
i
don't
believe
he
did
in
1945.
he
did
in
our
1958
motion
of
my
advisory
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
if
it's
reproduced
here,
i
--
i
don't
find
it
in
here
so
i
--
i
guess
we
can't
consider
it
part
of
the
record
except
that
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
statement
of
counsel
that
that
is
what
took
place.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it's
recited
at
page
5
and
6
on
the
brief
for
counsel
other
than
the
respondent
now
and
then.
the
parties
agreed
to
one,
the
entering
of
the
consent
decree
going
on
to
describe
what
the
decree
would
be.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
page
5
of
the
brief
--
the
green
brief
for
respondents
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
other
than
--
other
than
louisville
&
nashville
railroad
company.
the
parties
agreed
to
one,
the
entering
of
the
consent
decree
two,
the
waiver
and
release
by
the
plaintiffs,
the
law
claims
against
the
defendants
for
damages
and
three,
the
payment
of
the
sum
of
$5000
by
the
defendants
to
the
plaintiffs.
that
is
your
settlement
of
the
lawsuit
and
then
the
court
entered
the
decree
--
the
consent
decree
which
the
parties
had
written
up,
that
--
that
is
the
agreement.
so
that
there
--
there
is
no
agreement
separate
in
the
parts
from
the
decree.
we
just
get
together
and
said,
"we'll
settle
this
lawsuit
by
getting
with
--
agreeing
and
stipulating
if
the
court
may
sign
this
decree,
let
me
paying
you
some
money
and
you
get
him
your
release."
that
--
that
is
the
agreement
--
and
that
is
the
only
agreement
that
there
is
and
it's
--
it's
about
the
most
minimal
kind
of
a
--
an
agreement
you
could
ever
have
in
any
consent
decree
of
injunction.
so
that
if
the
court
post
that
such
a
settlement
of
a
case
bars
subsequent
modification
when
the
facts
clearly
demand
the
modification,
the
equities
demanded,
then
i
don't
see
how
we
can
ever
modify
any
consent
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we
have
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
we
have
mentioned
that
on
our
brief
your
honor.
there
is
no
right
of
the
court
to
exercise
discretion
in
the
ordinary
sense,
one
of
the
questions
before
purely
a
matter
of
law.
we
file
this
motion
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
change
in
the
statute.
there's
no
issue
of
burden
of
proof
there
or
anything.
we
say
that
the
statute
was
change
--
was
completely
eliminated,
pro
tanto,
the
right
that
the
injunction
previously
protected
and
the
court
has
no
discretion
to
misapply
the
law,
if
it
were
request
of
weighing
evidence
or
having
at
some
appraisal
as
to
what
the
effect
of
this
modification
might
be
for
factual
point
of
views
and
to
review
the
discretion.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wanted
to
state
that
particularly
with
respect
to
this
agreement
argument.
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
mr.
eldred,
when
called
upon
to
read
the
agreement,
turned
to
page
36
to
37
of
the
record
and
what
he
read
was
the
course
decree
which
--
which
simply
serves
to
emphasize
a
--
a
statement
that
what
mr.
eldred
and
the
court
--
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
language
which
he
read
to
you
held
that
that
decree
was
an
underlying
agreement.
that
would
--
the
decree
itself
that
they
said
was
the
agreement.
and
of
course,
we
argue
here
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
was
error
where
the
court
too
so
hold
and
it
was
directly
contrary
to
the
swift
case.
and
one
--
one
further
point
i
would
like
to
finish
was
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
he
turned
--
he
read
the
--
from
the
release
for
a
while
and
then
we
he
got
down
to
the
declaration
of
rights,
he
was
reading
from
page
37
of
the
record,
the
decree.
he
says
that
when
--
when
your
--
your
honors
pressed
him
for
more
language
as
to
what
the
obligations
and
what
the
prohibitions
were,
where
was
the
agreement
that
said,
what
they
were
prohibited
from
doing,
what
he
read
was
the
decree
and
that
of
course
is
what
we're
here
seeking
to
modify.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
i
think
that
28
people
were
just
a
--
a
group
that
claimed
they
could
show
some
wage
loss
or
(inaudible)
missed
out
on
some
overtime
assignments
or
promotions
and
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no,
this
is
not
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
this
is
not
a
racial
case.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
think
there
are
probably
some
of
both.
i
would
guess
that
a
majority
would
be
white.
i
think
mr.
eldred
could
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
correct
me
on
that.
i
think
there
were
some
both.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
that's
all
that
there
were
in
the
original
action
and
i
might
say
that
--
i
propose
your
honor's
question
to
mr.
eldred
down
the
consideration
concept
and
settlement
of
this
thing
for
$5000.
the
--
the
swift
case
would
seem
to
say
that
the
fact
that
28
people
might
have
entered
into
such
a
contract
if
there
were
any
contract,
wouldn't
justify
preventing
a
union
shop
agreement
to
be
negotiated
for
anybody
else
except
for
those
28
people.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
we
learn
as
we
go
along.
the
claim
was
really
a
--
a
claim
of
agreement
violations.
this
case
was
decided
before
this
court
decided
the
cases
local
against
steele
and
w.
which
created
the
concept
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
i
think
where
we
going
back
to
retry
this
lawsuit,
we
might
well
have
had
quite
a
hassle
as
to
whether
these
men
wouldn't
have
had
to
file
their
claims
for
deprival
of
overtime
under
the
overtime
rule
with
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
but
they
--
they
argued
that
they
had
gotten
deprive
over
fair
share
because
they
were
not
members
of
the
union.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
it
was
a
grievance
based
under
the
language
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
agreement
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
is
called
for
equal
distribution
of
overtime.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it's
not
limited
to
the
28.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it's
a
blanket
injunction
against
the
railroad
and
the
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
and
of
course
in
the
swift
case,
the
court
clearly
pointed
out
that
so
far
as
the
interveners
were
concerned,
people
other
than
the
original
parties
to
that
case,
they
couldn't
take
advantage
of
the
thing
if
it
were
contractual
(inaudible)
because
they
weren't
parties
that
running
contractual
undertake.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
wasn't
there
your
honor.
there
was
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
but
i
don't
believe
there
was
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
any
hearing
--
you're
talking
about
the
1945
decree.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
the
decree
was
drawn
up
by
the
parties
in
conferences
between
the
parties
to
the
lawsuit
and
exchanged
drafts
and
proposals
as
to
what
the
decree
are
to
recite
and
then
it
was
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
stipulated
that
it
would
be
submitted
to
the
judge
for
a
signature.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it
was
explained
to
him
i'm
sure.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
don't
believe
there
was
argument
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i'm
sure
you
wanted
to
know
what
the
case
all
about.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
well,
that's
a
subject
to
disputed
propaganda
claims.
the
--
at
the
hearings
on
this
motion
to
modify,
it
was
argued
that
--
or
suggested
that
maybe
the
--
might
be
about
a
50%
proposition
of
that
whole
in
view
of
this
alleged
bitterness.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
50%
members
and
50%
non-members
in
the
classes.
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
precipitate
a
representation
dispute
before
the
national
mediation
board
in
this
property.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
yes,
there
has
been
considerable
turnover
in
the
officers.
i
would
say
more
than
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
--
happy
to
the
general
chairman
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
no.
i
think
there
were
about
15
--
is
that
right
marshall?
how
many
plaintiffs
are
still
left?
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
(inaudible)
originally,
yes.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
there
would
be
eight
of
the
original
plaintiffs
initially
imposed
in
which
to
modify
and
then
a
number
of
other
employees
came
in
and
joined
with
them
in
imposing
that.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
it's
between
4000
and
5000
in
the
shop
crafts
group.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
they
are
all
over
the
system
of
the
louisville
national
railroad
company
in
the
(inaudible).
i
mean
the
employers
in
the
crafts,
most
of
the
employers
that
mr.
eldred
represents
are
in
the
louisville
area.
i
think
he
has
some
putative
come
in
and
join
--
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
they
were
all
from
around
louisville.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
were
they?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
r.
lyman
i
misunderstood
you.
