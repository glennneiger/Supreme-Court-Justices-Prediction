harlan
is
the
district
court
opinion
printed
in
the
record
on
page
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
your
--
i
suppose
what
the
technical
issue
is,
is
to
whether
this
is
an
abusive
discretion
when
the
court
begun.
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
that
it
isn't
a
(voice
overlap)--
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
--
where
is
that
agreement
now?
what
was
the
--
oh,
i'm
meant
you
say
an
agreement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
talking
about
something
underlying
the
decree
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
the
decree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
where
is
the
--
what
--
what
is
there
to
show
that
underlying
agreement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
--
what
could
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
could
provision
of
that
release?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
said
that
this
doesn't
say
that
though,
this
--
this
agreement,
does
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
perhaps,
there
are
extra
words
in
there
why
--
[laughter]
alright.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
undoubtedly,
that
goes
with
the
heart
of
the
case,
wasn't
it?
if
you
will
look
at
page
37
of
the
record,
this
is
the
consent
decree,
and
mind
you,
this
is
the
consent
decree
that
was
made
part
of
the
release
a
week
before
the
decree
was
entered.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
--
did
the
district
court
in
its
memorandum
interpret
the
settlement
as
you're
interpreting
it?
is
there
a
language
in
the
district
court's
opinion
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
says
that's
the
effect
to
it.
where
--
where
is
that?
