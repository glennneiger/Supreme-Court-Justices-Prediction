justice
felix
frankfurter
where
you
reading
at?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
contract,
could
an
agreement
had
been
entered
into
for
--
for
a
union
shop
on
the
label?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
that
which
stay
--
that's
what
you
rely
on
as
having
been
a
consensual
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
that,
i
can
set
you
a
contractual
arrangement,
wasn't
really
a
contractual
arrangement
because
they
weren't
free
to
have
the
opposite
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
mr.
eldred
(inaudible)
questions
come
to
my
head
namely,
would
you
agree
that
you
have
to
show
that
at
the
time
of
this
release,
it's
the
time
of
the
injunction,
the
import
is
going
to
have
--
or
the
amendment
of
the
railway
labor
act
goes
to
allow
union
shop,
was
an
active
issue
in
the
railway
--
in
the
railroad
world
or
in
the
part
of
the
railroad
and
in
part
of
the
brotherhood.
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
that
you
have
to
find
out
that
it
had
that
kind
of
reality
or
--
or
immediacy
rather
that
to
say
that
by
just
general
language,
they
foreclose
themselves
against
calling
and
unanticipated
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
in
the
action
but
in
the
--
in
the
word
--
in
the
world
that
which
they
were
moved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn't
the
only
--
that
wasn't
the
only
thing.
the
act
of
1951
wasn't
an
overnight
measure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
the
railway
--
the
act
of
1951
doesn't
create
an
agreement
that
--
so
that
the
agreement
must
come
from
the
parties,
the
parties
must
make
an
agreement.
in
1945
--
when
was
it?
in
1945
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
were
disabled
from
a
having
a
union
shop.
in
1951,
they
are
able
to
have
a
union.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
saying
is,
they
can
now
enter
into
an
agreement
which
they
could
enter
as
this
injunction
were
limited
to
--
lifted
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
injunction
were
lifted,
that
would
authorize
them
to
enter
into
an
agreement
which
you
say
would
have
a
clause
in
it
which
is
prohibited
by
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
eldred,
i
think
you
said
a
few
minutes
ago
that
you
thought
that
you
attribute
it
to
the
admission
as
the
argument
that
the
1951
act
is
a
compulsory
act,
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
follow
you
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
think
they
would
argue
tat
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
may
simply
say
that
a
decree
in
1945
in
the
context
of
law
which
prohibits
an
arrangement
which
is
now
permissible.
thereafter,
by
law,
is
allowed
to
be
submitted
or
to
lift
that
injunction
against
entering
into
a
voluntary
arrangement
to
avail
themselves
of
the
right
under
the
1951
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
1951
--
of
the
1951
act
certainly
didn't
speak
inquiry,
steele
and
tunstall,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
they
could
not
make
an
arrangement,
disadvantages
nor
--
and
whatever
the
difference
were,
which
did
not
give
fair
protection
to
your
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
couldn't
harbor
--
it
couldn't
harbor
and
switch
them
into
union
responsibilities
under
the
1951
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
a
--
but
they
--
it
would
be
a
union
shop
that
if
with
all
the
consequences,
i
believe
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
just
in
the
interest
of
making
the
thing
more
concrete
at
least
to
one
member
of
the
court,
indicate
what
the
practical
reasons
of
resistance
by
the
--
by
your
clients
with
having
a
union
shop
agreement.
is
--
is
that
a
fair
question
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
because
i
believe
the
contrary
that
fixing
an
agreement
isn't
in
and
out
of
itself
and
enforcing
consideration
(inaudible).
but
i
wonder
what
other
things
except
that
they
made
a
bargain
and
which
they
now
insist.
what
consequences
disadvantageous
to
them
would
follow
an
anticipated
union
strike?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
it
more
than
enough
that
i
don't
expect,
so
called
abstract
principles
but
doesn't
this
--
doesn't
this
--
that
it
is
translated
into
some
practicality
which
beyond
the
opposition
to
--
to
unions
as
such,
i
know
a
lot
of
people
had
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
haven't
they
got
some
special
reasons
or
rather,
i
mean
particular
reasons?
or
maybe
i'm
asking
questions
i
shouldn't
ask.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
they
have
to
pay
union
dues
and
in
return,
they
wouldn't
get
what
they
regard
as
--
as
advantages
for
substantive
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question
and
--
these
28
plaintiffs,
the
original
plaintiffs
for
the
class
which
they
represent,
do
they
--
was
there
any
--
any
differentiation
between
them
and
the
other
members
of
your
--
the
members
of
your
unions
except
for
these
people
have
principles
regarding
union
empathy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
28,
about
some
of
total
of
those
who
were
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
they
did
--
the
settlement
or
the
claim
which
was
settled
in
there
and
something
for
them,
was
a
claim
of
discrimination,
wasn't
it?
is
it
claimed
that
the
union
didn't
--
this
bargaining
agency
didn't
do
well
about
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
a
grievance,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
that
is
under
the
agreement
itself
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
their
claim
was
recognized
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
if
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(inaudible),
maybe
that's
--
maybe
they
--
they
had
from
experience.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
human
beings
are
instead
of
these
abstract
so-called
principles.
i
should
find
it
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
--
was
the
--
was
the
(inaudible)
hearing
before
to
judge
sherburne
joined
in
--
in
entering
the
decree
which
is
not
on
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
not
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
before
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
it
was
submit
--
when
it
was
submitted
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
before
it
was
done,
were
there
any
arguments
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
lieu
that
i
know
of
judge
(inaudible)
satisfied
himself
as
