justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
rule
printed
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
as
being
an
agreement
that
you
would
never
seek
a
modification
on
the
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it
--
why
did
he
say
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
would
be
the
same
thing,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
language
of
the
injunction
permanent
or
did
the
court
retain
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
purpose?
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
suppose
that
you
had
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know,
but
i
suppose
if
you
had
made
a
contract
based
on
the
valuable
consideration
which
was
valid
that
you
would
never
seek
a
modification,
it
might
be
that
the
rule
was
not
popular.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
effort
made
--
or
was
any
evidence
open
to
show
that
there
was
a
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
despite
of
the
fact
that
it's
simply
been
sent
decree
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
exact
language
where
the
court
said
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
152
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
perpetuity
--
in
perpetuity?
how
long?
did
the
court
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
the
court,
which
decided
the
case
have
agree
before
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but,
i'm
talking
about
the
one
that's
now
in
the
brief.
and
the
court
decided
on
the
basis
of
that
agreement,
this
is
now
put
into
briefs.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
whatever
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
the
--
was
the
release
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
it
did
have
so
it's
--
it's
really
part
of
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
is
to
be
considered
as
a
part
of
the
record
then
you
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
which
was
denied
of
the
undersigning
of
their
rights
and
benefits,
at
that
time,
they
had
a
right
not
to
be
asked
by
reason
of
a
union
shop
agreement,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
1951
act
changed
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
it
made
it
permissive
for
them
to
negotiate
further.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
gather,
you're
real
disputed
whether
this
denies
to
them
the
right
to
negotiate
which
was
granted
absence
agreement
under
the
act
of
1951.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
legal
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
would
not
be
illegal
if
they
have
one,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
would
not
be
illegal
if
they
would
have
an
agreement
now
to
have
that
kind
of
a
union
shop?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
wouldn't
deprived
anybody
of
any
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
employee
of
any
right
unless
they
have
it
under
a
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
do
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
one
of
the
parties
contemplated
at
that
time
the
act
of
1951,
sir?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
justice
harlan.
you
referred
first
to
that
and
you
said
in
such
agreement
now
in
effect
or
that
may
hereafter
be
in
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
be
deprived
if
any
rights.
but
short
after
is
to
bar
--
is
to
bar
them
by
keeping
this
injunction
from
entering
into
a
new
agreement
as
a
--
as
a
part
of
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
do
you
get
benefits
then
from
this
statement
that
the
reference
referred
such
agreements
now
in
effect
or
that
may
hereafter
be
in
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
say
anything
about
they're
not
entering
into
one
hereafter
in
accordance
with
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
there
any
hearings
on
that
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
hearing
when
they
passed
that
amendment
to
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
railroads
appear
did
the
unions
appear?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
whether
any
--
anything
came
up
about
the
reason
for
passing
it,
was
--
was
this
particular
matter
referred
to
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
case,
i'm
talking
about
the
l&n
strike
and
the
trouble
they
had
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
when
--
when
was
the
contract
entered
in
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1945.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
was
it
--
when
was
it
they
had
the
controversy
where
the
--
you
said
to
the
board
that
--
that
the
railroads
in
1951
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
is
amended?
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
1943.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
--
i've
just
had
one
other
question,
is
the
injunction
against
you
are
entering
into
open
sub-agreement
under
the
new
act
with
reference
to
everybody,
the
employees
now
or
is
it
limited
to
these
28?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
general
blanket.
justice
hugo
l.
black
injunction
that
you
have
upon
the
obligation
under
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
the
person
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
percent
of
the
total
employees
are
members
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
50%
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
were
these
employees?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
these
28,
where
were
they
from?
