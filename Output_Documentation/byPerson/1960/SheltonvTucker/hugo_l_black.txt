how
could
it
be

justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
ever
--
how
could
it
be
balanced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
his
divulsion,
if
he
does
belong
to
some
association.
what
you
have
is
an
affidavit
that
requires
him
to
tell
all
the
associations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can't
get
out
of
that
by
saying,
i
belong
to
these
and
others
i
do
not
go
--
i
do
not
think
is
relevant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
fails
to
do
that,
he
loses
his
job
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
only
way
he
could
--
if
there
is
to
be
a
balance
here,
the
only
way
it
could
be
done
to
see
whether
or
not
he
might
be
subjected
to
other
telephone
calls
and
harassments,
would
be
for
him
to
say,
i
belong
to
such
and
such
an
organization
which
would
subject
me
to
harassment.
if
it
--
could
it
be
done
in
any
other
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
that
statute
has
drawn,
which
requires
statement
of
all
organizations,
even
if
they
have
used
to
harass,
it
has
no
limitation
at
all.
as
no
--
is
there
any
way
that
he
can
consistently,
with
this
law,
refuse
to
tell
all
the
organizations
he
belongs
to
in
this
affidavit
without
even
being
guilty
of
perjury
or
losing
his
job?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then,
he
might,
for
all
we
can
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
belong
to
some
organization
that
would
subject
him
to
the
same
kind
of
harassment
that
was
referred
to
in
naacp
against
alabama.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
couldn't
find
here
on
the
facts
without
divulging
what
organization
he
belongs
to,
could
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
--
do
you
not
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
affidavit
it
has
to
be
made?
is
it
not
in
--
inescapable
that
you
do
reach
it?
must
we
not
assume
that
he
might
belong
to
some
that
would
subject
him
for
the
harassment
or
should
we
assume
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
following
up
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
following
up
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
is
what
i
had
in
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this,
if
it
be
true
that
this
is
broad
enough
to
require
revelations
and
divulsions
of
organizations
in
which
he
belonged,
it
might
subject
him
to
the
harassment.
he
therefore,
has
a
right
to
privacy
in
that
regard,
a
constitutional
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
couldn't
the
state
abridge
that
by
saying,
we
won't
tell
anybody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i'm
--
maybe
i'm
telling
--
but
the
thing
i
have
in
mind,
it
may
not
be
relevant
and
it
seems
to
me
it
might
be.
he
said
he
was
not
in
--
well,
that
was
because
we
knew
what
the
organizations
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
test
it
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
way
you
could
revert
--
review
to
bring
about
what
these
organizations
are
is
for
him
to
give
out
the
names
of
those
to
which
he
belonged,
which
would
subject
him
to
this
--
what
was
found
in
that
case
to
be
a
very
important
matter.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
constitutionally
speaking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
your
position.
you
can
make
your
net
so
broad
that
it
would
include
not
merely,
taking
the
argument
that's
been
made.
it
would
include
not
merely
the
revelation
of
things
that,
alright,
it
teaches,
the
board
ought
to
know
them,
it
would
include
something
that
might
bring
about
the
very
results
that
were
mentioned
in
alabama.
you
make
your
net
so
broad
that
there's
no
way
to
escape
revelation
of
it,
divulging
it,
unless
--
and
to
get
it
protected,
you
think
with
the
bets
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
answer
to
that
seems
to
be
that
there
are
some
--
if
you
might
have
to
--
it
was
going
to
be
abridge
this
constitution
and
i
know
that
it
would,
but
since
it's
been
held,
since
they
would
hold
it
confidential,
that's
enough
to
justify
the
breadth
of
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
in
reference
to
what
you
said.
when
a
question
of
discharge
of
a
teacher
in
the
university
of
arkansas
contract,
who
has
to
pass
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
to
be
discharged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
just
simply
asked
because
you
think
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
question
that
you
have
said,
it
would
not
be
--
it
would
be
held
confidential
and
i
was
just
wondering
who
had
to
act
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
--
how
is
the
board
made
of?
justice
hugo
l.
black
appointed
by
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
governor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
approved
by
the
senate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
confidential
by
whom?
justice
hugo
l.
black
administrators
--
that
wouldn't
do
any
good
if
the
board
of
trustees
had
found
out.
