mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
little
rock
special
school
district,
the
board
of
directors
thereof,
and
the
superintendent.
we
were
parties
to
this
proceeding
because
mr.
shelton,
the
plaintiff,
was
an
employee
of
the
little
rock
school
district.
he
had
been
an
employee
for
25
years
prior
to
this
time.
as
mr.
carter
has
accurately
stated,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
any
disqualification
on
his
part
by
virtue
of
incompetency
or
any
other
reason
than
the
fact
that
mr.
shelton
refused
to
file
the
affidavit
required
by
act
10.
the
school
district,
under
those
circumstances,
later
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
stipulated
so
there
would
be
no
question
in
this
record
that
due
to
his
failure,
his
contract
was
not
renewed.
that
stipulation
came
in
later.
it
was
made
necessary
here
because
of
the
proceedings
that
developed
and
so
that
there
would
be
no
question
and
we
had
no
disposition
to
let
the
matter
go
off
on
any
--
a
procedural
point
one
way
or
the
other.
little
rock
school
district
takes
no
issue
with
reference
to
the
wisdom
of
this
legislation.
we
do
not
think
the
wisdom
of
it,
one
way
or
the
other,
is
important.
i
believe
mr.
carter
stated
here,
there
had
been
no
showing
in
justification
for
the
act
of
any
necessity
for
it.
certainly,
the
record
was
not
developed
in
that
particular
but
we
would
state
our
position
that
this
is
immaterial
and
is
not
properly
before
the
court.
there's
no
necessity
for
such
a
showing,
if
the
legislature
has
acted
properly
within
the
scope
of
its
power
or
jurisdiction,
then
it
is
not
a
question
to
challenge
whether
it
--
the
motives
and
what
not
that
it
acted
on
it
or
the
wisdom
that
it
used
in
that
regard.
now
we
would
state
the
position
of
the
school
district
in
the
case.
i
think
i
can
state
it
fairly
simply.
it
may
not
turn
out
to
be
such
a
simple
situation.
certainly,
freedom
of
speech,
freedom
of
association,
freedom
of
assembly
are
protected
and
have
been
so
held
by
this
court
by
the
first
amendment,
which
is
read
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
certainly
being
of
such
a
fundamental
nature
as
being
part
of
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore
applicable
as
to
state
action.
now,
there
is
no
question
about
that,
the
decisions
leave
no
doubt
that
that's
there.
i
have
a
little
trouble
with
it
here.
the
test
seems
to
have
been
that
the
particular
legislation
that's
challenged
amounts
to
a
substantial
abridgement
of
these
rights
that
are
there.
we
have
pointed
out
that
while
these
rights
certainly
exist,
there
are
no
sanctions
in
this
act,
unlike
the
usual
situation
of
the
cases
that
come
up
when
you
get
into
subversive
activities
or
disloyalty
or
what
not.
this
act,
if
you
list
any
number
of
organizations
or
if
you
list
the
communist
party,
the
act
does
not
say
that
you're
discharged
for
that
reason,
the
act
simply
says,
"you
will
file
the
affidavit
and
give
the
information."
now,
of
course,
the
sanction
is
there
that
if
the
affidavit
is
not
filed,
then
the
school
districts
and
those
others
under
the
act,
the
institutions
of
higher
learning,
there
are
several
incidentally
in
our
arkansas.
the
university
of
arkansas
is
the
largest
with
some
5,000
or
6,000
students.
there
are
several
other
state-supported
colleges
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
arkansas
state
college
is
at
jonesboro.
it
--
most
of
them,
i
am
not
sure,
most
of
them
would
cover
the
arts
courses,
probably
not
--
other
than
the
university,
none
of
them
haven't
brought
a
curricular
to
be
of
the
university
class.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
that's
primarily
a
teachers
college
and
is
at
conway.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
--
i
believe
five
would
cover
it.
there's
a
one
at
monticello,
one
at
magnolia
and
so
forth.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
other
than
their
cash
funds,
they
have
student
fees,
certain
student
fees
and
what
not,
but
primarily,
they're
called
state-supported
institutions
of
higher
learning.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
my
understanding.
on
the
tenure
question,
i
might
address
just
a
moment
on
that.
i
could
give
the
court
my
understanding
of
it.
i
have
substantially
agreed
with
mr.
carter's
analysis
that
we
have
a
statute
in
the
state
that
provides
that
unless
notice
is
given
within
a
specified
period
at
the
time
of
this
litigation,
it
provided,
that
in
the
event
a
teacher
was
under
contract
with
a
school
district
and
notice
was
not
given
by
the
parties,
one
way
or
the
other,
within
a
10-day
period
after
that
the
particular
school
term,
that
contract
was
automatically
renewed
for
one
more
year.
so
in
that
sense,
if
no
notice
was
given,
you
had
tenure
for
a
year.
now,
there
are
good
many
school
districts,
and
i
think,
i
am
outside
of
the
record
on
this
but
as
a
matter
of
information,
i
think,
the
university
of
arkansas,
which
by
regulation
of
the
particular
governing
body,
the
board
of
trustees,
there
are
in
the
case
of
my
client,
the
board
of
directors
of
the
school
district,
have
given
the
teachers
tenure.
and
we
have
specified
conditions
upon
which
a
teacher
maybe
discharged,
but
we
cannot
of
course,
go
contrary
to
a
state
law.
school
districts
are
creatures
of
the
state
law
and
if
the
state
says,
we
must
have
an
affidavit,
of
course,
we
have
adhered
to
the
state
law.
but
if
an
affidavit
was
filed,
then
i
think
we
would
be
bound
by
the
tenure
provisions
that
we
read
into
our
contracts
and
the
information
that
maybe
developed
by
the
affidavit
would
--
could
perhaps
be
used
a
little
differently
by
different
school
districts
depend
on
what
--
depending
upon
what
their
particular
regulations
that
they
may
put
in
their
contracts
may
be.
alright,
but
in
general,
aside
from
that,
i
think
it
takes
nothing
to
discharge
if
you
give
the
notice
as
required
or
after
the
one
year
carryover.
you
can
discharge
with
or
without
cause.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
the
school
district
get
financing
in
two
ways.
they
have
what
we
call,
ad
valorem
taxes,
which
under
our
present
constitutional
provision,
each
school
district
can
vote
by
putting
up
a
budget
ahead
of
time
and
specifying
a
mileage
in
having
the
people
voted
ad
valorem
taxes,
without
limitation.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
within
the
district,
yes,
sir.
in
addition,
the
school
district
gets
state
aid
on
the
basis,
or
forgotten
of
figures,
a
little
over
half
would
come
in
from
their
own
taxes
and
perhaps
a
little
less
than
half
would
come
in
from
state
aid
which
is
distributed
on
a
minimum
foundation
and
apportionment
act
of
the
state
legislature.
now,
as
i
stated,
we
do
not
challenge
the
proposition
that
under
certain
circumstances,
the
freedoms
of
assembly
and
of
association
and
of
joining
any
type
of
organization
that
a
teacher
might
be
required
to
list
in
this
affidavit,
we
do
not
challenge
the
fact
that
they
would
fall
within
the
first
and
therefore
brought
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
under
certain
circumstances.
now,
in
the
situation
here,
i
am
not
sure
that
we
hit
that
substantial
abridgment
of
the
freedom
of
association.
now,
in
the
cases
that
the
court
has
considered,
if
we're
talking
about
a
private
situation,
which
the
facts
of
this
case
show,
that
is
as
to
the
parties,
these
affidavits
were,
under
these
facts,
treated
as
confidential.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
that
makes
them
confidential.
there
is
nothing
in
the
law
that
makes
them
public
records.
and
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
when
it
passed
on
the
case,
really
left
the
question
open.
but
they
did
point
out
that
they
could
be
treated
as
confidential.
now,
as
long
as
this,
they
are
treated
as
confidential
information,
as
long
as
we
do
not
get
into
a
situation,
such
as
alabama
or
bates,
whereby
if
we
are
concerned
with
naacp
membership,
so
that
the
mere
public
knowledge
of
that
membership
interferes
substantially
with
the
right
of
association,
because
it
discourages
one
to
associate,
if
they
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
punishment
by
physical
abuse
or
annoying
phone
calls.
now,
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here
on
this
record.
we
are
not
talking
about
anything
as
constituting
a
substantial,
an
abridgment
of
these
rights
as
those
--
as
those
cases
are.
here,
we
have
information
furnished
to
a
school
board
and
the
other
case
you
will
have,
it's
furnished
to
of
course
to
a
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
by
policy.
they
keep
them
confidential;
no
one
knows
about
it,
we
feel
is
a
proper
inquiry.
so,
i
feel
first
on
the
balancing
of
the
two
considerations
as
we
see
it.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
even
have
a
substantial
abridgment
of
these
rights.
although,
as
if
it
had
been
in
the
cases
where
the
court
has
said
that
these
are
so
important
that
we'll
weigh
this
against
the
considerations
of
the
state
if
the
state
has
strong
cogent
reasons
for
acting
in
this
field,
even
though
they
abridge
them
some,
we'll
weigh
one
against
the
other.
now,
in
the
weighing
process,
i
see
nothing
in
these
facts
that
gets
it
even
in
the
category
of
those
cases.
alright,
now,
the
other
consideration
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
follow
you.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
understand.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
suppose
mr.
justice,
i
was
speaking
in
a
manner
of
degree.
even
on
that
analysis,
i
could
think
--
i
should
think
it
would
not
be
as
important
to
a
person
if
he
were
disclosing
it
to
a
group
of
gentlemen,
five
or
six
in
number,
who
were
interviewing
him
concerning
his
position.
certainly,
in
a
matter
of
degree,
we
do
not
have
the
same
substantial
type
abridgment,
if
he
had
to
disclose
it
to
the
whole
world.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
we
invoke
--
we
have
matters
of
degree
in
the
whole
question.
i
think
that's
the
position,
certainly,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
how
could
it
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
no,
sir.
other
than
with
the
limitations
of
acting
in
good
faith
and
knowledge
that
this
court
has
put
in,
i
think
if
he
inadvertently
forgot
one
or
something
of
that
sort,
certainly
we
aren't
talking
about
that.
but,
i
would
say
that
on
its
face,
the
statute
reads
and
you
have
correctly
stated,
he
is
required
to
list
these
associations
that
he
has
belonged
or
to
which
he's
been
a
dues-paying
member
within
the
five-year
period.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
well,
in
that
sense,
it
--
my
point
was,
in
the
alabama
case,
certainly
the
court
found
on
the
facts
as
i
recall
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
on
the
facts
that
are
before
this
court,
we
do
not
get
into
that
end
of
it,
as
i
see
it.
now,
all
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
think
you
would
have
to
assume,
your
honor
that
it
would
be
divulged
to
these
12
that
these
12,
would
then
not
treated
as
confidential
that
it
would
then
be
divulged
to
persons
who
were
off
the
temperament
to
subjecting
to
that
harassment.
i
think
we'd
have
to
assume
several
things
that
may
well
result
from
the
application
of
this
act,
which
might
possibly
own
down
the
line
and
make
it
unconstitutional
in
its
application,
but
cannot
affect
its
constitutionality
on
its
face,
which
as
we
see
it,
is
the
question
now
before
the
court.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
--
we
could
assume
many
things.
i
think
certainly,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
alright,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'd
say
that
even
though
we
concede,
he
has
the
constitutional
right.
i'd
say
the
state,
in
proper
circumstances
of
which
our
position
would
be
this
was
one,
can
abridge
that
right.
is
there
a
compelling
reason
here
for
the
state
that
justifies
an
abridgment
of
that
right?
now,
there
was
not
in
alabama,
there
was
not
in
bates
as
this
court
found.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
i'd
suppose
my
position
is
that
it's
not
just
enough
to
find
to
get
a
final
decision
of
the
issue
before
this
court
that
there
is
first,
a
constitutional
right
that
the
constitutional
right
may
well
be
abridged
and
that
there
will
be
interference
with
his
complete
freedom
of
association
by
facts
that
may
develop,
if
a
full
disclosure
is
made.
i
think
it's
not
enough
just
to
find
that.
we
also,
or
the
court
also,
makes
an
inquiry
to
determine
whether
or
not,
the
state
is
properly
asked,
acting
within
its
field,
to
get
the
information
and
balances
one
against
the
other,
and
then
determines
whether
there
is
an
abridgement
within
limitations
because
of
what
the
state
is
doing
and
the
need
for
the
information
that
the
state
is
getting
in
this
situation.
i
don't
know
whether
–
properly
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
the
statute
is
as
broad
as
could
be.
it
asks
the
blanket
question.
there
isn't
a
question
about
that,
sir.
it
asks
the
blanket
question,
list
them
all.
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
attempt
to
define
them,
to
list
professional
organizations
or
list
any
other
category.
it
says,
list
all
organizations.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
don't
think
that
it
need
necessarily,
mr.
justice,
go
off
on
the
point
of
whether
they
even
hold
it
confidential
or
not.
i
think
then
as
long
as
they
are
holding
it
confidential,
certainly,
we
do
not
have
the
substantial
type
abridgment
that
we
may
want
to
guard
against.
now,
even
if
it's
not
held
confidential,
there
still
would
be
the
basic
balancing
of
the
state's
interest
on
one
hand
against
the
individual's
interest
on
the
other
in
the
form
of
the
abridgment
of
legislation.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
if
i
understand
you
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
understand
your
correct
--
your
question
correctly,
you
are
asking
me
that
if
--
is
there's
anything
in
tenure
however,
we
get
it
in
arkansas
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
--
that
would
protect
the
man
against
being
discharged
if
--
for
being
a
member
of
the
naacp,
if
that
were
disclosed
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
is
that
correct?
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
now,
first,
of
course,
there's
nothing
unless
in
a
particular
district
by
board
action.
there
is
no
tenure
provision
at
all.
now,
i
would
assume
that
there
would
be
no
reason
in
the
absence
of
some
tenure
provisions
by
a
particular
board
of
directors
that
a
school
district
need
to
assign
any
reason.
they
could
simply
give
notice
that
you
are
discharged
as
a
practical
matter
would
be
very
difficult
to
find
out
whether
they
did
it
for
this
reason
or
did
it
for
another.
but
now,
if
your
question
is,
if
you
could
establish,
of
course,
even
though
they
have
a
right
to
discharge
them
without
cause,
if
they
use
an
unconstitutional
cause
that
is
if
you
discharge
a
man
on
a
basis
of
discriminating
against
him
because
he
is
a
colored
man,
then
i
think
you
would
--
you
would
have
certain
rights
even
contract
rights
supposedly
that
could
be
enforced.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
and
that
--
that's
the
sole
reason
listed?
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
other
than
how
his
constitutional
rights
would
be
affected,
by
virtue
of
the
action
taken,
i'm
not
sure
of
trying
to
think
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure.
supposedly
if
the
school
board,
which
when
it
acts,
it
constitutes
state
action,
he
might
well
violate
some
constitutional
rights,
maybe
if
you
get
into
the
civil
liberties
and
what
not.
but
as
far
as
under
--
just
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
unless
the
particular
provisions
of
tenure
that
were
there
stated,
incidentally
as
do
little
rock,
that
you
have
to
have
some
reason
which
bears
on
fraud,
dishonesty,
incompetency,
and
what
not.
unless
we
could
bring
it
within
one
of
those
provisions
or
unless
the
facts
develops
that
this
discharge,
under
the
tenure
rights
that
he
has,
must
be
on
these
reasons
that
we
give.
i'd
have
to
fit
the
naacp
and
--
and
see
where
we
--
if
it
--
when
the
--
when
i
analyze
the
facts
and
see
if
i
came
out
with
an
answer
that
i
had
brought
it
within
or
without
what
his
contracts
right
were
by
virtue
of
that
tenure.
now
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
the
legislature
recited
a
finding
of
a
committee
to
that
effect
in
act
115.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
that
was
the
one
that
was
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court,
the
three-judge
court
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
that
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
this
one
in
which
we
did
not
plea.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
would
think
most
probably
do
not.
i
have
found
a
very
few
of
them
have
the
detailed
administrative
procedures
as
the
little
rock
district
has.
yes
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
there
are
over
400.
your
honor,
too
many.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
after
the
end
of
the
school
year.
that
was
the
provision
of
the
statute
at
the
time.
and
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
held
in
a
situation
when
the
school
district
did
not
give
the
notice
within
the
10-day
period.
the
teacher
was
automatically
rehired
on
the
same
terms
for
the
next
year
and
the
courts
suggest
--
yes
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
the
affidavit
on
this
act
has
to
be
filed
once
a
year
your
honor.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
eventually,
i've
forgotten
the
exact
time
that
is
there.
it's
before
the
--
before
the
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
the
superintendant
sends
out
notice
and
states
that
contracts
will
be
considered
in
may,
you
must
have
your
affidavits
then
by
such
and
such
a
time.
so,
probably,
each
school
district
is
more
or
less
regulating
that
but
when
they're
requiring
the
affidavits
to
be
in
prior
to
the
new
contracts
being
issued.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
actually,
we
got
in
a
situation
where
some
of
these
questions
unanswered
because
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
and
a
preliminary
restraining
order
was
issued
enjoining
in
a
class
action,
which
through
some
uncertainly
as
to
how
broad
it
was
covered,
enjoining
everyone
from
taking
any
action
in
one
way
or
the
other.
so,
everyone
including
the
university
of
arkansas
had
to
hold
up
on
it.
so,
we
finally
got
around
and
everyone
went
by
the
10-day
period
and
these
questions
were
never
answered.
and
then
we
gave
them
another
time
limit.
i
think
in
this
situation,
he
was
given
up
to
june
the
25th
as
i
recall,
of
that
year,
to
get
in
the
affidavit
after
the
three-judge
federal
court
dissolved
the
injunction
and
held
that
act
10
was
constitutional.
he
was
given
a
specified
time
limit.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
hadn't
really
--
i
hadn't
really
thought
about
it,
mr.
justice
clark,
but
i
think
that
i
would
answer,
yes
to
that.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
there
are
penalties.
in
fact,
you
can
recover,
i
think,
against
the
board
that
enters
into
a
contract.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
we
did
not
so
interpret
it.
he
was
given
no
hearing
and
had
no
opportunity
for
judicial
review.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes.
in
that
situation,
we
treated
it,
it
maybe
subject
--
now,
these
are
questions,
perhaps
they
have
not
been
answered
for
the
state
court.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
if
an
employee
decided
to
raise
it
by
virtue
of
having
a
contract
automatically
renewed
or
by
virtue
of
having
tenure
rights
which
are
read
into
his
contract
by
administrative
procedure.
but,
the
school
districts,
being
preachers
of
the
legislature,
and
the
legislature
said,
that
he
must
do
these
things,
we
had
taken
the
position
and
had
so
advised
them
and
no
one
had
challenged
it
or
taken
to
court
if
the
affidavit
were
not
filed.
they
were
written
a
letter
and
stating
under
these
circumstances,
we
will
not
be
in
position
to
renew
your
contract.
and
mr.
shelton
comes
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
do
you
mean
if
the
board
had
another
reason
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
--
not
to
renew
it?
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
under
state
law,
aside
from
what
you
may
put
in
the
contract
itself
in
particular
districts,
it
is
my
understanding
the
board
does
not
have
to
give
any
reason
and
he
--
and
the
discharged
employee
is
entitled
to
no
court
review
(inaudible).
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
wabbaseka.
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
think,
substantially
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
have
teacher
retirement
in
arkansas.
i'm
--
mr.
justice,
i
couldn't
give
you
the
exact
breakdown
but
we
do
have
teacher
retirement.
we
have
some
overlapping,
there's
a
question
on
right
now
of
social
security,
but
then,
it's
substantially
a
social
security
situation
but
we
have
a
teacher
retirement
act,
yes,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
know
of
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i
would
have
to
answer
you.
i
did
not
check
it.
i
know
of
no
reason
why
he
would
be
disqualified
from
receiving
teacher
retirement,
that's
correct.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
no
sir,
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
there
--
there
was
a
--
mr.
herschel
h.
friday
jr.
no,
sir.
there
--
there
was
an
application
for
a
stay
that
was
denied,
it
was
not
pursued
further,
as
i
understand.
alright,
perhaps
mr.
carter
can
answer
that
more
accurately.
i
had
my
recollection
there
was
in
this
--
in
this
case.
i
would
just
touch
briefly
on
the
other
points
that
we
have
in
this
situation.
there
is
the
allegation
here
that
the
act,
if
not
bad
for
other
reasons
because
it
is
too
general,
we
do
not
feel
it
is
too
general,
then
it
is
bad
on
the
basis
of
condemnation
by
association,
i
suppose
there's
a
proper
charge
of
words.
now,
on
the
two
general
points,
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
proper
area
for
state
inquiry
that
the
state
legislature,
in
its
wisdom
which
should
not
be
tested
or
reviewed,
determined
that
in
the
proper
administration
of
the
public
schools,
it
would
be
helpful
and
school
boards
were
directed
in
accordance
with
that
determination
to
get
this
affidavit,
to
get
a
listing
of
the
associations.
they
were
not
told
to
discharge
anyone.
they
were
not
told
to
take
any
particular
action
one
way
or
the
other
with
reference
to
the
information
that
they
got.
the
facts
show
that
the
school
boards
involved
in
this
case
have
treated
it
as
confidential
as
other
personnel
information.
there
is
no
right
to
a
public
meeting
or
public
records
on
information
regarding
personnel.
otherwise,
our
statute
provides,
you
must
have
those
meetings.
we
say
that
the
state
can
properly
ask
this
information
that
it
is
not
too
broad
under
the
standards
as
set
up
by
this
court,
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
attempt
to
confine.
alright,
therefore,
we
say
for
that
reason,
the
right
of
the
state
in
this
appeal,
under
the
facts
of
this
case
in
testing
this
act
as
to
whether
it's
constitutional
on
its
face,
at
least,
outweigh
any
abridgment
that
may
exist
of
freedom
of
speech
or
freedom
of
association.
alright,
now,
further
quite
apart
from
that
and
if
that
would
be
the
result,
if
this
were
a
session
of
the
legislature
when
there
were
no
desegregation
problems
in
the
state,
i
think
it
is
argued
here
that
because
it
was
passed
at
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
arkansas
in
1958,
when
there
were
such
problems,
that
by
virtue
of
being
part
of
a
package,
it
is
bad
by
association
because
it
was
one
of
the
laws
that
were
adopted
by
the
legislature,
which
have
been
condemned
and
are
being
condemned
here
as
attempts
to,
i
believe
the
language
is,
defy
the
decision
of
this
court.
now,
we
state
with
reference
to
that
that
the
allegations
are
not
sound.
they
are
not
sufficient
grounds
to
condemn
this
act,
to
hold
it
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
there
is
nothing
in
the
base
of
the
act
that
makes
it
unconstitutional.
there
is
nothing
in
the
facts
that
makes
it
unconstitutional
as
to
its
application.
we
state
that
the
motives
of
the
legislature,
the
motives
of
the
governor
of
the
state
of
arkansas
in
his
proclamation
and
in
the
speech
that
was
introduced
in
this
record
to
which
we
object
it
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
not
proper
or
immaterial.
as
this
court
has
held
and
as
the
state
of
arkansas
has
held,
the
motives
make
not
difference
if
the
legislature
is
acting
within
the
proper
scope
of
its
authority,
we
will
not
inquire
as
to
why
we
did
--
as
to
why
it
did
these
things.
now,
that
basically
is
our
position.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
ramsay,
alright,
sir,
represents
the
pine
bluff
school
district.
mr.

has
any
questions,
