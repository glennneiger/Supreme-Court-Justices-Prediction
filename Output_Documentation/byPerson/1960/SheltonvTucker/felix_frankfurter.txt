can
you
derive
that
just
by
reading
that
section?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
would
you
disagree
as
an
abstract
session
with
the
first
sentence
of
that
section?
no
stop
at
--
at
the
bottom
--
of
comma.
justice
felix
frankfurter
“it's
hereby
determined
that
the
decisions
require
solution
of
a
great
variety
of
local
public
school
problems
of
considerable
complexity
immediately
and
which
involve
the
health,
safety
and
general
welfare,”
suppose
--
would
you
disagree
with
that
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought,
on
the
face
is
exactly
what
it
means
that
you
take
a
statement
by
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
go
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
go
outside
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
--
this
isn't
just
the
way
of
quibbling,
you
may
be
in
right
in
what
you've
last
said,
but
i
wouldn't
say
that
on
its
face,
as
i
understand,
on
its
face
means
if
you
just
need
it,
it
compels
that
--
that
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
understand.
you
mean
that
it
require
any
teacher
in
any
educational
institution
to
give
a
list
of
the
clubs,
associations,
corporate
institutions
of
which
he
is
a
member
which
is
what
the
statute
does
on
its
face.
that
on
it
--
that
is
impermissible
under
the
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
this
statute
applies
to
every
public
educational
institution
in
the
state,
does
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
includes
the
university
of
arkansas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
from
what
you
last
said
or
a
minute
ago
said
that
the
professors
or
full
professors
of
the
university
of
arkansas
has
merely
an
annual
tenure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
has
that
applied
to
the
university,
i'm
just
curious
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
other
institutions
of
higher
--
higher
education
are
there
not
enclosed
inside
the
university?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
large
are
the
faculty?
did
you
happen
to
know
how
large
the
faculty
they
have
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
university
of
arkansas,
there
must
be
considerable
faculty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
the
statutes
are
restricted
to
inquiry
into
membership
or
association
with
any
organization
that
concerns
itself
on
purpose
of
using
of
a
more
or
less,
meeting
the
standard
--
concerned
itself
for
education.
do
you
object
to
that?
would
that
be
too
vague?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
it
said
--
suppose
my
statute
would
say,
"predominantly
concerned
with
education."
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
all
sorts
of
organizations
--
you
have,
indeed,
concerns
with
self-education.
justice
felix
frankfurter
league
of
women
voters
concerns
itself
with
education.
justice
felix
frankfurter
naacp
concerns
itself
with
education.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
brotherhood
--
railroad
brotherhoods
concerns
themselves
with
education.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
couldn't
it
find
out
whether
their
members
--
suppose
they
have
oral
interviews
--
suppose
they
have
oral
interviews
to
be
inversed
to
feel
a
--
area
about
to
which
i'm
more
acquainted
with
which
i'm
more
acquainted
than
other,
and
you
think
of
engaging
a
professor
in
history,
you
asked
him,
"what
have
you
written?
under
who
did
you
study?
where
did
you
get
your
degree?
what
are
your
interests
and
what
association?
can't
you
ask
him
to
what
association
he
belongs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
you
think
--
you
wouldn't
make
a
difference,
would
you,
between
what
you've
been
asked
on
the
basis
on
which
you
refused
employment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
orally,
face
to
face
or
to
ask
on
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
ask
him,
if
he's
been
in
the
war,
whether
he's
a
member
of
the
legion?
then
he
says,
"no,
none
of
your
business."
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
think
if
i
hire
person
to
teach
history
or
economic
or
sociology
or
psychology,
and
i
ask
him,
"do
you
belong
to
the
legion?"
i
can't
say
--
i
am
asking
you,
because
i
want
to
get
your
attitude
toward
an
organization
like
the
legion.
do
you
think
that's
outside
of
--
what
i
would
think
might
bear
on
the
kind
of
a
brain
he
has
or
what
he's
thinking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
what
he
thinks
is
relevant
in
the
forces
--
in
the
non-governmental
forces
that
make
for
american
life?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
why
isn't
that
relevant,
what
i
think?
if
he
says,
"i
think
the
legion
is
(inaudible),
the
opposite,
why
isn't
that
relevant
in
what
kind
of
a
person
he
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
take
the
league
of
women
voters,
and
let's
try,
is
this
a
dangerous
time
in
which
to
bring
into
question
anything
concerned
with
the
flags
are
i
think
in
league
of
women
voters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
that
relevant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
the
function
of
private
organizations
and
how
they
pursue
their
pressures
of
poor
legislation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
that
relevant
as
to
what
kind
of
view
he
has
in
teaching
of
the
social
courses
of
america?
why
isn't
that
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
if
i
do,
then
of
course
it's
unconstitutional
but
we're
here
to
discuss
whether
i
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
relevance
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
relevance
to
his
outlook
on
problems
with
which
is
a
scholar
and
a
teacher
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
have
any
view
he
pleases.
i
am
not
preventing
him
from
having
views,
but
isn't
an
institution
entitled
where
the
man
has
an
irresponsible
view
about
the
right
of
association.
suppose
he
says,
i
think
it's
wrong
for
veterans
to
club
together.
it's
wrong
for
women
to
do
thus
and
so.
don't
you
think
that's
relevant
to
what
a
man
does
in
a
classroom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
you
suppose
that
teachers'
thought
processes
have
some
relation
to
whether
i
should
--
whether
i
should
hire
him
as
a
teacher?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
let
me
put
you
another
case.
that
recently
as
this
saturday,
i
received
in
the
mail
with
considerable
postage
caused
from
the
sender
of
fixed
thing
that
consisted
of
reprinting
of
the
protocols
of
the
elders
of
zion,
you
know
what
that
is,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
had
i
asked
the
fellow,
don't
teach
history
or
sociology,
what
do
you
think
of
the
protocols
of
the
elders
of
zion
as
a
doctrine,
and
you'd
say,
well,
you're
now
searching
my
thought
processes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
him
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
ask
--
i
didn't
come
to
that.
i
wanted
to
ask
whether
i
can
ask
him
those
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
think
it
is
in
credit
that
you
think
i'd
be
an
odd
stick
to
ask
those
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
would
you
think
they
were
relevant,
not
as
an
exception
of
foolish
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that's
this
case,
what
i'm
trying
to
search
what
the
limits
of
this
problem
are,
because
these
are
very
complicated,
as
you
know,
very
complicated
and
subtle
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
a
lot
of
people
of
whom
i
couldn't
ask
that
without
their
right
to
say,
"it's
none
of
your
business."
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
for
no
reason
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time
that
i
think
i
did
already,
but
i
want
to
pursue
the
inquiry
of
my
brother
stewart
regarding
the
implications
of
this
one-year
tenure
in
arkansas.
suppose
the
state
--
suppose
the
educational
authority,
forgetting
this
statute.
suppose
the
statute
haven't
been
on
the
books
or
ceased
to
be
on
the
books,
asked
just
as
a
voluntary
act
on
the
part
of
teachers,
if
they
wish
of
their
own
free
will,
to
give
a
list
of
their
associations,
just
like
this,
with
no
legislative
compulsion,
and
some
do
and
some
don't.
at
the
year,
suppose
the
educational
authorities
do
not
renew
--
do
not
rehire,
if
i
may
use
that
term
about
teachers,
reemploy
teachers,
and
they
do
not
reemploy
all
those
who
did
not
make
these
voluntary
disclosures.
as
you
understand
the
law
of
arkansas
that
stands,
is
there
any
redress
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
arbitrary
exercise
had
the
right
of
the
legislature
of
the
teaching
--
of
the
board
of
education
whatever
they're
called,
not
to
renew,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
just
about
going
to
ask
that
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
sent
for
the
membership
of
institutions
in
the
association
of
american
university
professors
and
i
find
there
are
five
of
them.
the
arkansas
agricultural
mechanical
college,
arkansas
polytechnic
college,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
arkansas
state
college.
what
is
that
mr.
friday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
the
arkansas
state
teachers
college.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
that
there
five
that
are
members
to
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
university
professors
association.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
all
state
--
wholly
state
supported?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
of
the
financing
of
the
school
districts
or
the
school
within
the
school
district,
are
they
by
the
--
how
are
they
financed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
the
district,
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
do
you
--
may
i
ask
you
why
you
say
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
if
it
is
contended
by
mr.
carter,
the
board
is
asking
that
this
legislation
requires
that
he
answers
questions,
information
of
which
he
may
withhold,
and
to
that
extent,
you're
intruding
upon
what
do
the
private
deserves,
on
that
argument,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
you
want
--
you
said
you
couldn't
think
there
was
any
abridgment
here
because
the
suit
is
maybe
kept
confidential,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
if
the
inquiry
goes
to
things
which
maybe
kept
private
even
to
disclose
to
a
responsible
body
like
the
trustees
of
universities
--
university
of
arkansas.
and
to
that
extent,
you're
compelling
somebody
to
say
something
or
put
something
on
paper
that
he
may
withhold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
once
you
invoke
the
questions
of
degree,
you
invoke
balancing,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
districts,
school
districts
are
there
in
the
state
of
alabama?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
district
court
--
the
district
court
denied
it,
did
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no
motion
was
made.
no
result
was
held
to
this
court
were
stated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
someone
that
said,
happy
is
the
city
that
has
no
dispute.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
co-education?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must've
misheard.
did
you
say
a
minute
ago
that
no
one
has
failed
to
file
such
an
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
failed
to
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
what
is
the
controversy
that
comes
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
must
be
stupid
mr.
ramsay,
would
you
--
would
you
enlighten
me.
you
say,
you
were
brought
in
because
of
the
class
action,
does
that
mean
good
fellowship?
what
is
this?
i
didn't
understand
that.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all
events
that
such
--
what
you
call
appeal
would
--
or
concerned
with
the
prospective
of
something
that
would
happen
next
year,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
is
the
legislature
of
arkansas
in
session?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
one
can
conjecture,
we
might
conjecture
that
they
might
decide
to
reveal
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
--
assuming
that
the
restrictive
use
confidential,
top
secret
restrictions
govern
--
would
make
the
difference,
assume
that
for
the
purpose
of
my
question,
could
you
enjoin
the
thing
on
the
theory
because
another
school
board
next
year
might
take
off
the
(inaudible)?
assume
that
under
the
existing
situation
and
on
existing
school
administration,
there
is
the
restriction
--
there
is
the
restriction
placed
upon
them
in
terms
for
the
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
having
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was,
assuming
that
that
made
a
difference,
that
that
would
--
that
that
the
objection
now
is
that
this
is
being
made
public
and
thus
potentially
an
instrument
of
--
of
arousing
fear
etcetera,
assume
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assume
that
that
isn't
confidential,
it's
alright
to
put
and
come
in
and
say,
"we
enjoin
this
because
next
year,
we
might
have
different
school
boards."
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
somebody
else
do
it
--
let
somebody
else
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
independent
on
the
part
of
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
independent
on
the
part
of
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
sua
sponte
made
its
restriction
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
would
you
disagree
or
--
or
will
you
comment
on
the
suggestion
that
the
information
that
is
sought
to
be
elicit
under
this
act,
or
information
that
could
be
elicited
personally
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
would
you
rule
out
as
inadmissible
in
the
personal
interview?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
wasn’t
asked
under
this
affidavit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
from
your
point,
you
have
to
go
beyond
it
and
see.
