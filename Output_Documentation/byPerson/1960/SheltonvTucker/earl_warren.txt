mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
rely
--
and
do
you
rely
on
that
section
alone
that
you
have
read
or
do
you
rely
on
the
other
--
on
--
on
the
real
body
of
the
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
don't
get
too
broad
and
general.
let's
get
down
the
case
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
were
asked
the
question
what
do
you
rely
on
and
all
you
cited
to
us
was
--
was
that
section.
now,
if
there's
anything
else
in
the
act,
i
suppose
you
read
it
to
us.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friday.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friday,
may
i
ask
you
this
question
and
maybe
at
little
feel
but
you're
--
you
were
telling
us
about
the
limited
tenure
that
you
have
in
arkansas
and
you
told
us
that
within
certain
10-day
period,
the
contracts
could
be
terminated
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
--
by
either
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
is
there
anything
in
that
tenure
that
would
protect
the
man
from
termination
of
his
contract
for
being
a
member
of
the
naacp
and
for
no
other
reason
if
that
was
disclosed
in
this
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
assuming
that
there
is
no
other
reason
for
his
discharge,
as
the
superintendent
or
the
president
of
the
university
at
least
had
said
this
to
one
of
these
appellants.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
don't
say
it,
say,
a
colored
man,
let's
say
it's
white
man
who
belongs
to
the
naacp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
could
he
be
discharged
solely
for
that
reason
if
it
was
disclosed
in
his
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
your
legislature
has
said?
i
don't
know
whether
it's
in
this
act
or
one
of
the
others
that
the
naacp
is
a
captive
of
the
communist
party.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
one
that
was
struck
down?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.m
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
so,
would
you
mind
telling
us
if
most
of
your
school
districts
do
or
do
not
have
this
tenure
that
is
established
by
their
own
departments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friday,
that
i
probably
just
--
or
just
one
more
question
on
the
tenure
matter.
assuming
that
the
--
in
the
case
of
an
old-time
teacher
like
this
one,
the
board
sends
him
notice
that
his
contract
will
not
be
renewed,
is
he
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
which
cause
must
be
shown
for
his
discharge,
and
if
so,
what
kind
of
a
hearing
is
it,
and
is
there
any
judicial
review
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
has
no
opportunity
for
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
would
that
be
the
same
--
would
that
be
the
same
regardless
of
what
the
board
might
have
had
in
mind
when
it
refused
to
renew
his
contract?
suppose
the
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
in
other
words,
does
the
board
have
to
disclose
to
the
teacher
the
reason
for
not
reviewing
--
renewing
his
contract?
and
then,
after
having
done
that,
is
he
entitled
to
a
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
ramsay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
weren't
there
something
in
the
record
of
one
of
these
cases
to
the
effect
that
the
members
of
the
school
board
said
that
they
were
under
no
obligations
to
keep
these
sayings
confidential?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
you
would
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
--
if
you
have
another
statement,
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
pass.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
ramsay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.

max

et

petitioners,
versus
r.
a.
young
et
al.
mr.
dunaway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
light.
chief
justice
earl
warren
consider
that
--
that
language
of
the
supreme
court
(inaudible)
holding
to
the
effect
that
this
is
part
confidential
and
cannot
be
used
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
did,
can
you
say
that
it
was
not
for
use
in
any
other
way
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
there
is
this
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
mere
fact
that
they've
signed
the
affidavits
are
conclusive
on
the
point
that
there
is
no
thereat
to
their
civil
liberties
because
if
the
man
didn't
sign
the
affidavits,
that
is
(inaudible)
what
the
--
the
forms
of
the
naacp
under
the
statute
that
your
legislature
has
passed
and
your
governor
assigns,
they
would
have
been
entirely
out
of
the
employment
and
it
could
--
could
not
sustain
any
other
(inaudible)
employment
in
any
college
in
the
entire
state
of
arkansas.
it’s
almost
equivalent
to
banishment,
isn’t
it,
insofar
as
(inaudible)
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
titles,
you
take
that
into
consideration
that
there's
a
--
there's
a
possible
views
that
could
be
made
and
(inaudible)
this
affidavit
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
legislature
passed
it
then
your
governor
signs
it
and
it
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
and
what
a
--
and
to
state
the
primary
requirements,
they
file
this
action
and
was
been
(inaudible)
that
that
it
requires
them
contributions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friday.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dunaway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
i
would
like
to
say
that
you,
counsel
on
both
sides.
