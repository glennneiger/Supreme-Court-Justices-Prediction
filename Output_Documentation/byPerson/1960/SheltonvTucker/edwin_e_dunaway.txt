mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
two
petitioners,
max
carr
and
ernest
gephardt.
max
carr
was
an
associate
professor
of
music
at
the
university
of
arkansas,
until
he
was
discharged
because
of
failure
to
comply
with
act
10.
ernest
gephardt
was
a
vocational
printing
instructor
at
central
high
school
in
little
rock
until
he
was
discharged
for
the
same
reason.
we
filed
separate
suits.
they
were
consolidated
for
trial
in
the
chancery
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
and
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari.
now,
there
are
several
facts
in
our
case
which
i
think
is
important
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
which
add
something
to
the
other
case,
the
shelton
case.
carr
and
gephardt
did
not
refuse
to
file
any
affidavit,
carr
being
required
to
file
an
affirmation
but
in
both
cases,
these
two
petitioners
listed
the
professional
organizations
of
which
they
were
members,
stated
that
they
are
not
now
and
never
have
been,
members
of
a
subversive
organization
and
offered
to
answer
any
questions
touching
upon
their
associations
and
activities
which
their
administrative
superiors
might
constitutionally
ask
them
touching
on
their
qualifications
to
continue
teaching.
they
refused
to
give
the
additional
broad
information
required
by
the
statute.
the
record
shows
that
no
additional
questions
were
asked
of
these
or
these
teachers.
at
the
trial,
the
president
of
the
university
of
arkansas
testified
that
he
personally
and
the
others
in
the
administration
wanted
carr
to
continue
teaching
that
there
had
been
no
complaints
about
his
teaching.
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
gephardt
case.
the
superintendent
of
schools
of
little
rock
testified
that
gephardt's
principal
had
recommended
that
his
contract
be
renewed
and
that
but
for
act
10,
he
would
be
--
would
continue
to
be
employed.
since
i
am
sure
that
the
respondents
in
this
case
will
argue
substantially
what
was
argued
by
the
appellees
in
the
other
case.
i
will
proceed
that
both
by
making
my
argument
and
answering
what
i
conceive
to
be
erroneous
contentions
of
what
the
applicable
law
is.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
the
–
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
the
university
of
arkansas
does
have
tenure
regulations.
there
is
no
statutory
authority
in
arkansas
for
any
tenure
regulations.
as
was
stated,
it
varies
from
each
college,
depending
on
what
each
college
board
wants
to
do.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
theoretically,
he
can
only
be
dismissed
because
after
you've
been
there
four
years
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
but
they
have
a
--
each
one
gets
a
new
contract
which
must
--
each
year
there
--
there's
a
new
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
right.
there
is
a
sample
contract
in
the
record,
carr’s
contract
on
page
99
of
the
record
which
is
the
typical
contract
that
the
university
grants
annually
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
we
do
not
contend
that
school
authorities
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
99,
yes,
sir.
we
do
not
contend
that
school
authorities
may
not
ask
teachers
and
prospective
teachers
about
their
associations
and
activities
as
they
are
relevant
to
their
suitability,
fitness,
loyalty
and
so
on
as
has
been
stated
in
the
opinions
of
this
court.
we
do
say,
however,
that
there
is
a
great
difference
in
permitting
school
authorities
to
ask
any
conscious
questions
and
having
a
broad
blanket
statute
like
this
which
is
not
limited
in
any
way.
it
includes,
you
must
list
religious
organizations
to
which
you
have
made
contributions.
you
must
list
political,
there
is
no
limit
whatever
and
a
written
record
is
made
of
it.
now,
this
duress
is
the
vice
in
this
statute.
it
is
too
broad.
it
is
an
unjustifiable
invasion
of
individual
rights
and
there
is
no
compelling
necessity
shown
to
warrant
such
a
--
a
great
invasion.
now,
we
alleged
in
our
complaints
and
there
is
proof
in
the
record
that
the
real
purpose
of
this
statute
was
shown
by
two
things.
the
governor's
call,
but
particularly
is
addressed
to
the
opening
session
of
--
opening
session
of
the
second
special
session,
made
it
plain
that
the
purpose
of
the
legislative
session
was
to
enact
legislation
as
he
put
it
to
solve
problems
not
of
their
own
making
but
thrust
upon
us
from
the
outside,
namely
by
this
court.
then
there
is,
in
the
emergency
clause,
the
declaration
that
the
reason
for
the
affidavits
is
to
solve
problems
created
by
the
supreme
court's
desegregation
opinions
in
this
--
in
the
school
cases.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
true
we
cannot
question
the
governor's
motives
nor
can
we
question
the
motives
of
individual
legislators
who
voted,
but
if
that
emergency
clause
together
with
his
address,
setting
the
tone
for
the
meeting
and
stating
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
shows
what
the
purpose
was
as
distinguished
from
the
motive,
we
object
to
the
equating
of
motive
and
purpose
and
we
argue
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
must
be
a
compelling
purpose
which
would
justify
the
invasion
which
this
statute
makes.
now,
in
the
record
--
i
thought
you
were
going
to
ask
some
questions.
we
allege
in
our
complaint
that
the
real
purpose
was
to
provide
a
vehicle
whereby
school
teachers
who
had
the
temerity
to
advocate
compliance
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
brown
case,
would
be
made
known
and
that
they
could
be
hounded
out
of
their
jobs.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
and
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
if
--
if
they
put
down
--
if
they
put
down
the
urban
league
or
the
naacp
or
the
southern
council
for
human
relations,
the
organizations
such
as
the
citizen’s
council
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
well,
there
are
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
well,
we
might
not
be
able
to
but
there
are
those
in
the
citizen's
councils
who
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
exactly
your
honor
but
they
did.
amis
guthridge
testified
that
people
who
belong
to
the
american
association
in
university
professors,
the
urban
league,
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
the
little
rock
women's
emergency
committee
to
open
the
school,
if
they
had
their
way,
would
be
fired
from
the
teaching
system.
now,
it
is
our
contention,
true
that
just
because
there
are
organizations
that
want
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
all
teachers
are
going
to
be
fired
but
we
do
argue
that
this
unnecessary
exposure
runs
--
views
exactly
the
situation
that
was
true
in
naacp
against
alabama.
it
opens
up
these
teachers
to
endless
harassment
by
these
groups
and
public
denunciation
and
further
than
that,
puts
pressure
on
the
local
school
boards
which
are
annually
elected,
either
to
make
this
information
public
and
get
rid
of
them
or
to
change
the
school
board
and
that
as
a
--
that
the
court
must
look
at
this
according
to
the
facts
of
life
in
arkansas
as
they
are.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
here's
the
situation
on
that.
the
attorney
general's
opinion
is
in
the
record
at
page
100.
in
the
last
sentence
on
page
102,
"it
is
an
administrative
determination
to
be
made
by
the
respective
boards
as
to
the
disclosure
of
information
contained
in
the
affidavits.
"
now,
it
is
also
true
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
said
that
it
would
be
possible
for
these
affidavits
to
be
put
to
an
unconstitutional
use.
it
did
not
say,
however,
it
recognized,
as
i
read
the
opinion
that
it
is
up
to
the
board
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
they'd
be
made
--
kept
confidential
and
the
fact
that
they
maybe
confidential
today
with
one
board
does
not
mean
that
next
year,
they
will
be
confidential
so
there
is
an
ever
present
threat
that
organizations
which
may
be
considered
to
be
unpopular
by
the
folks
in
arkansas
will
be
made
public
and
it
will
have
the
definite
deterrent
effect
of
making
a
great
many
of
them
refrain
from
participating
in
associations
which
they
otherwise
would
join
and
work
with.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
well,
i
think
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
as
being
too
broad
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
what?
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
that
certainly
is
drawn.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
i
guess
you
could.
now,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
if
the
legislature
has
acted
properly,
this
court
cannot
question
its
act
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
begs
the
question
which
is
involved.
the
question
here
is,
is
it
proper
to
enact
such
a
broad
probing
piece
of
legislation
and
the
record
is
absolutely
devoid
of
any
showing
of
necessity.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
on
the
matter
of
necessity
is
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
university
of
arkansas
when
asked
by
the
attorney
general
whether
this
affidavit
would
be
helpful
to
the
university
officials
in
screening
applicants
and
the
president
said
no.
now,
granted
--
just
because
the
president
said
no,
doesn't
mean
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional,
but
it
does
seem
relevant
on
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
necessary
when
it
is
urged
in
justification
for
the
broad
affidavit
thing
that
it
is
needed
by
those
administering
the
school
system.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
as
i
read
it,
the
court
said
that
the
information
need
not
be
opened
to
the
public
but
does
not
say
may
not
be
open
to
the
public
and
my
argument
is
that
there
is
the
constant
threat
there
that
it
maybe
opened
at
any
time.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
well,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
petition
for
rehearing,
the
court
was
admonishing
the
school
boards
not
to
use
the
act
for
the
purpose
for
which
we
contend
it
was
enacted
and
that
if
they
did,
they
might
be
in
trouble.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
again
looking
at
the
thing.
practically,
that
is
necessary
to
accuse
school
boards
of
bad
faith.
there
may
well
be
school
boards
in
certain
parts
of
arkansas
who
in
perfectly
good
faith
could
consider
membership
in
the
urban
league
or
the
naacp
as
grounds
for
dismissal.
and
it
therefore
be
presuming
of
their
good
faith,
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
an
answer
to
the
argument
that
this
statute
requires
too
broad
a
base
of
information.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
if
it
pleases
the
court,
just
a
word
or
two.
first,
i'd
like
to
observe
that
constitutional
rights
and
the
invasion
of
constitutional
rights
is
not
to
be
determined
by
the
number
of
those
who
are
willing
to
have
them
invaded
without
going
through
the
unpleasantness
of
an
extended
lawsuit
in
order
to
vindicate
them.
so
the
mere
fact
that
a
number
of
arkansas
school
teachers,
rather
than
contest
the
thing
themselves,
went
ahead
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
let
--
let
somebody
else
do
it
and
we
will
get
the
benefit.
mr.
justice
black,
i
find
that
i
do
have
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
sir?
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
i
find
that
i
do
have
a
copy
of
my
brief
in
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
i
don't
have
all
of
them
which
i'll
leave.
i
pointed
out
in
the
argument
that
they're
--
they
were
arguing
on
the
--
no
automatic
dismissal.
while
it
was
true
that
there's
no
automatic
dismissal
and
neither
is
there
anything
in
the
provision
to
provide
that
the
affidavit
spiraled
with
the
information
contained
therein
should
be
held
confidential
by
the
school
authorities.
and
consequently,
any
school
governing
body
on
its
own
initiative
or
when
subjected
to
pressure
from
certain
self-appointed
guardians
of
the
public
wheel
which
not
only
the
truth
showed
but
which
we
all
know
are
currently
operating
in
arkansas,
they
will
make
public
such
affidavits
in
whole
or
in
part.
the
question
was
put
to
the
court
and
i
read
the
arkansas
supreme
court's
opinion
only
as
mr.
light
says
as
a
caveat
but
it
is
certainly
not
a
holding
that
the
information
must
be
kept
confidential.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
my
recollection
is,
they
didn't
take
any
position
because
it
didn't
argue
--
because
the
attorney
general's
letter
was
in
the
record
there
that
in
his
opinion,
it
was
up
to
each
individual
board.
finally,
and
--
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
yes,
yes.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
to
the
extent
that
it
is
restriction,
yes,
your
honor.
in
every
other
case
where
this
court
has
sustained
inquiry
--
the
right
of
inquiry
and
to
personal
associations
of
teachers
and
other
public
employees,
it
has
been
on
a
narrowly
restricted
basis
as
in
the
beilan
case
where
the
discharge
of
beilan
was
approved
for
incompetency
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
inquiry
was
made
and
no
publicity
was
given
to
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
act
is
sustained,
the
court
is
going
further
than
it
ever
has
in
permitting
a
very
real
indirect
restraint
on
freedom
of
association
which
can
be
just
as
devastating
to
that
right
as
a
direct
one.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
without
--
in
any
way
is
weakening
the
right
of
public
authorities
to
inquire
under
the
loyalty
and
fitness
of
their
employees,
the
court
can
strike
down
and
should
strike
down
this
act
as
going
too
far
of
the
question
of
requiring
the
authorities
to
ask
individual
questions.
there's
no
proof
that
there
has
been
any
problem
as
--
there's
been
no
law
of
this
kind
and
the
person
testified
that
there
was
no
demand
for
such
a
law
on
the
part
of
school
administrative
officials.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
i
think
that
some
of
the
information
which
is
sought
to
be
elicited
here
could
be
elicited
in
the
personal
in
here.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
for
example,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
proper
question
to
ask
what
religious
organizations
i
made
a
contribution
to
just
as
an
example.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
you
have
to
list
under
this
affidavit
every
organization
of
which
you
are
a
member,
to
which
you
pay
dues
or
have
made
regular
contributions.
there
is
no
limit
to
it
so
a
--
a
contribution
to
your
church
would
have
to
be
listed
whether
or
not
you
have
contributed
to
the
republican
or
democratic
party,
would
have
to
be
listed.
i
realize
that
this
is
a
delicate
problem
of
balancing
and
certainly
(inaudible)
exactly
each
question
which
would
or
would
not
be
within
the
realm.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
this
court
needs
to
hold
now
is
that
it
is
a
balancing
problem
and
this
statute
goes
to
the
extreme.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
right,
right.
mr.
edwin
e.
dunaway
they
do
not,
your
honor.
