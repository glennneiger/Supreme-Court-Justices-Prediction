mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
the
court
pleases,
appeal
involves
the
constitutional
validity
of
an
arkansas
statute,
which
requires
all
schoolteachers
in
the
institution
--
public
institutions
of
higher
learning
and
all
public
school
teachers
and
supervisor
and
personnel
in
the
public
schools,
to
file
an
affidavit
listing
all
of
their
organizational
connections
as
a
prerequisite
to
--
for
employment.
the
statute
is
number
act
10
and
it
was
passed
at
a
--
at
the
second
extraordinary
session
of
the
general
assembly
of
arkansas
in
december
of
1958.
at
that
time,
the
session
was
called
by
the
governor
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
--
which
had
come
about
by
virtue
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
school
segregation
cases
and
specifically
by
virtue
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
aaron
versus
cooper.
the
appellants
say
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
for
two
reasons.
one,
we
--
we
say
that
this
is
a
broad
proscription
of
the
freedom
of
association
of
the
schoolteacher
with
the
inevitable
consequence
that
it
is
of
destructive
of
academic
freedom
in
the
public
institutions
in
arkansas.
and
we
say
secondly
that
this
is
in
effect,
race
legislation,
because
the
purpose
and
--
and
intent
of
the
act,
by
virtue
of
it
on
--
actually
on
its
face
and
by
virtue
of
it
in
the
time
in
which
it
was
passed,
was
intended
to
prohibit
and
frustrate
advocacy
of
school
integration
in
arkansas
and
the
freedom
of
the
teachers
to
in
--
involve
themselves
in
this
kind
of
activity.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
on
--
the
statute
was
set
out,
mr.
justice
harlan,
on
the
beginning
at
page
3
of
--
of
our
--
the
brief
of
the
appellants.
if
you
will
read
section
7
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
seven,
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
page
5,
it
is
hereby
determined
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
schools
segregation
cases
require
a
solution
of
a
great
variety
of
local
problems
etcetera.
we
think
that
that
and
the
call
in
the
address
that
the
--
of
the
government,
indicates
and
a
--
a
purpose
to
proscribe
integration
--
an
advocacy
of
integration
of
the
public
schools.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
you
mean
the
--
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
i
wouldn't,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
wouldn't
disagree
with
the
statement
but
i
--
the
statement
itself
of
course,
is
--
it
gives
us
no
help
--
you
--
in
terms
of
what?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
and
that
--
as
far
as
--
as
we're
concerned
in
terms
of
giving
meaning
to
what
this
or
what
this
--
the
statement
intent
--
what
the
statement
was
meant
to
--
to
cover.
we
think
that
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
special
session,
the
governor's
statement
which
illuminated
the
session
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
reasonable.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
our
--
well,
our
--
our
view
is
that
the
statute
is
void
on
its
face
without
regard
to
its
racial
implications
and
--
and
with
regard
to
that,
i
think
that
--
or
we
will
try
go
out
the
position.
we
also
feel
that
the
statutes
as
a
racial
disarm.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
that's
our
position.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
our
pro
--
proposition.
and
i
would
--
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
--
mr.
chief
justice,
we
were
--
on
that
for
the
broad
general
proposition
which
i've
stated
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
in
our
first
attack.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
if
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would.
i
was
attempting
to
cite
that
section
for
was
to
the
--
was
to
the
effect
that
i
--
that
i
was
arguing
that
this
was
racial
legislation.
what
we
had
in
terms
of
the
statute
--
our
attack
on
the
statute
as
being
a
prohibition
on
the
--
of
the
freedom
of
assembly
of
the
teacher.
we
rely
on
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
not
only
of
the
section
7,
but
all
of
the
sections
because
of
what
it
--
what
it
--
it
requires
the
teacher
to
do.
this
is
the
--
this
is
our
portion
in
terms
of
that
and
we
feel
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
of
the
fact
that
it
--
it
does
--
does
take
away
from
the
teacher
the
right
and
the
freedom
to
associate
without,
we
say,
any
--
any
relationship
or
meaning,
any
of
the
yardsticks
to
this
court
has
held
or
required
in
statutes
of
this
kind.
the
--
the
statute,
section
1
of
the
statute
at
page
3,
says
that
its
purposes
are
to
assist
in
the
administration
and
financing
of
the
school
and
to
--
and
this
--
the
legislature
says
that
it's
going
to
be
beneficial
to
the
school
systems
to
require
these
affidavits.
now,
the
--
the
statute,
as
set
out
in
section
2,
indicates
that
every
teacher
and
superintendent
is
going
to
have
to
give
these
affidavits.
there
is
no
indication
of
what
kind
of
organizations
are
--
are
to
be
listed,
that
all
--
all
organizations
and
not
only
membership
in
the
organization,
but
any
organization
which
the
teacher
has
paid
--
which
he
regularly
play
--
pays
dues
or
makes
the
contribution,
all
of
these
are
required
to
be
listed.
on
page
4,
we've
--
the
statute
sets
out
the
kind
of
--
of
affidavit
which
is
required.
now,
in
arkansas,
teacher
contracts
are
entered
on
a
--
on
an
annual
basis.
there
is
no
tenure
in
the
--
in
arkansas
as
far
as
we
know,
except
for
the
fact
that
if
--
if
your
--
if
you
--
if
a
teacher
is
not
given
a
notification
within
the
specified
period,
then
she's
entitled
to
--
to
be
retained
for
the
following
year.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
it
does.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
the
contracts
are
entered
on
a
yearly
basis.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
it
does
apply
to
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
to
the
university
of
arkansas
there
--
there
are,
in
terms
of
the
colleges
and
institutions,
there
maybe
some
rules
and
regulations
which
they
have
but
they
are
required
to
enter
a
contract
with
the
teacher,
it
is
my
understanding,
every
year.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
--
the
only
other
one
i
know
of
is
this
--
the
negro
college,
the
college
for
negroes
which,
i
think,
is
the
arkansas
agricultural
mechanical
and
normal
college
and
that's
the
only
corporate
institution
that
i
know
of.
there
may
be
others,
but
i'm
not
aware
--
aware
of
it.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
know,
i
do
not
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
this
is
a
--
as
i
understand
the
--
the
college
for
negroes
is
a
--
is
a
big
institution.
now,
the
statute
does
require
that
this
be
listed
and
that
therefore,
each
year
when
the
teacher
comes
to
have
a
contract
for
employment,
this
kind
of
affidavit
has
to
be
filed.
now,
the
appellants
here
are
a
teacher,
the
named
appellant
here
is
a
teacher
in
the
public
schools,
he's
taught
in
the
public
schools
in
little
rock,
arkansas
for
a
period
of
some
25
years.
there's
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
his
work
was
satisfactory.
there
was
no
complaint
about
his
work
in
terms
of
his
fitness
and
suitability.
there's
no
controversy
about
the
fact
he
has
filed
an
affidavit
that
he
is
not
a
member
of
any
organization
which
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
he
has
indicated
in
his
--
in
the
--
in
the
affidavit
to
the
complaint
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
and
that
his
purposes
in
joining
that
organization
was
to
improve
the
negro
status
in
general.
he
has
refused
to
file
the
affidavit
required
on
the
grounds,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
that
this
is
a
violation
of
his
rights
and
the
rights
of
other
teachers
to
freedom
of
association.
the
other
appellant
is
the
--
an
arkansas
teachers
association
which
is
an
organization
of
the
negro
teachers
in
arkansas.
and
they
are
bringing
the
action
along
with
the
named
appellant,
shelton,
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
of
all
the
negro
teachers
in
the
public
institutions
in
arkansas.
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
this
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
was
--
this
was
--
the
affidavit
that
i'm
talking
about
that
shelton
has
filed
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
was
filed
in
connection
with
his
complaint.
this
was
filed
in
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
as
an
exhibit
to
his
complaint.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
he
refused
to
file
an
affidavit.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
subsequent
section,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
only
of
the
naacp,
i
believe.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
was
passed
with
the
subsequent
session
at
the
--
at
the
1959
regular
session
of
the
--
of
the
general
assembly
which
i
think
occurred
some
six
months
after
this
session.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
are
these
by
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right,
sir.
the
only
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
it
was
not
an
issue
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
because
there
was
no
issue
with
respect
to
this
broad
--
as
i
understand
in
the
next
case.
the
appellant
here
was
a
member
of
the
naacp
and
he
attacked
--
the
attack
therefore,
was
made
both
on
the
act
115
and
on
act
10.
the
court
below
held
that
the
act
10
was
valid
on
--
and
held
that
it
had
--
that
they
had
to
look
at
the
two
title
statutes
separately.
they
held
that
act
115
was
unconstitutional
and
that
they
declared
that
the
--
this
man
could
not
be
fired
because
of
his
membership
in
the
naacp.
now,
subsequent
to
that
decision,
the
appellant
continued
to
refuse
to
file
the
affidavit
required
by
act
10
and
he
was
notified
by
the
school
board
that
because
of
his
refusal
that
he
was
not
to
be
employed
for
the
1959,
1960
school
term.
so
that
he
was
in
fact,
fired
because
of
his
refusal
to
sign
the
--
to
fill
out
the
affidavit.
now,
we
think
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
act
10,
without
regard
to
the
first
issue
that
i
was
raising.
that
is
taking
it
--
viewing
the
statute
as
if
it
were
not
passed
at
the
second
extraordinary
session
as
mere
--
as
if
it
had
no
import
at
all
with
respect
to
race.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
bad,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
statute,
it
seems
to
us,
fails
to
meet
what
we
regard
or
what
we
feel
are
the
yardsticks
that
this
court
has
laid
down
for
upholding
and
validating
the
statutes
of
this
kind.
as
far
as
those
yardsticks
are
concerned,
we
think
that
there
are
three.
and
they
are
that
there
must
be
the
statute,
if
the
statute
impinges
on
freedom
of
speech,
that
the
statute,
there
must
be
some
compelling
justification
for
it
which
must
be
demonstrated.
we
think
that
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
this
legislation
or
in
the
record
here
to
show
that
there
was
any
great
need
for
this
statute,
any
justification
for
it
at
all.
the
second
requirement
we
believe,
is
that
the
statute,
if
there
is
an
equal
statute,
that
there
must
be
some
rational
connection
between
what
the
statute
seeks
to
achieve
and
the
restriction
which
is
imposed.
now,
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
connection
between
assisting
in
the
administration
of
financing
of
schools
and
benefiting
schools
and
the
problems
caused
--
raised
by
the
school
segregation
cases,
any
connections
between
that
and
the
restriction
on
freedom
--
on
the
freedom
of
association
of
the
public
school
teacher.
and
even
if
those
measures
are
met,
we
think
that
the
statute
has
failed
to
meet
a
third
yardstick,
which
this
court
has
imposed,
and
that
is
that
if
an
impingement
on
speech
is
validated,
the
statute,
which
validates,
must
be
in
such
terms
that
it
cannot
be
utilized
to
restrict
constitution
--
the
constitution
exercise
of
each
and
other
area.
in
other
words,
what
we've
tried
to
use,
we've
used
the
language
of
the
court
that
was
used
in
sometime
ago
and
has
not
been,
as
far
as
we
know,
used
in
subsequent
recent
cases,
but
the
idea
was
that
the
statute
has
to
be
narrowly
drawn
and
confines
of
the
specific
regulation,
the
specific
restriction
which
is
allowable.
now,
we
think
that
on
all
of
these
measures,
the
statute
must
fall,
because
what
we
feel
to
be
the
policy
of
the
reason
of
the
court
below,
is
that
the
court
below
says
that
these
teachers
association,
teachers
habits,
and
so
forth
are
relevant
to
determine
the
fitness
in
the
school
system.
we
think,
of
course,
that
the
school
--
the
school
authorities
have
the
right
to
investigate
the
teacher
to
determine
fitness,
etcetera.
but
what
we
think
that
the
school
authorities
cannot
do
is,
in
order
to
attempt
to
do
that
to
restrict
the
freedom
of
association
of
the
teacher
entirely
on
the
ground
that
by
in
this
way,
they
may
uncover
some
evidence
which
is
relevant
to
fitness.
we
think
that
they
are
required
to
make
a
decision
and
a
declaration
as
to
what
association
they
regard
as
being
relevant
to
the
issue
of
teacher
fitness
which
they
are
seeking
to
do
something
about.
spell
that
out,
require
the
teacher
to
list
those
associations,
if
they
are,
and
then
at
that
point,
the
statute
comes
here
to
be
measured
--
to
be
measured
by
the
yardsticks
of
this
court
as
to
whether,
in
fact,
the
associations
which
had
been
listed
or
had
been
required
to
be
listed
are
relevant
to
the
issue
of
fitness.
now,
we
think
that
the
reliance
on
garner
versus
the
los
angeles
board
and
the
reliance
on
the
lerner
case
and
the
beilan
case
and
adler
case
on
this
place.
in
the
first
place,
this
is
not
an
issue
of
subversion
here
at
all.
we
also
believed
that
--
and
because
of
that,
we
don't
think
that
they
can
be
in
reliance
on
that
and
we
think
that
the
language
in
those
cases
has
to
be
related
to
the
issue
of
what
the
court
had
in
mind
or
what
the
court
slurs
the
state
was
attempting
to
do,
was
that
there
was
some
correlation
between
the
question
of
fitness
and
the
subversion
or
inquiry
about
subversion,
which
the
school
authorities
were
attesting.
we
don't
have
that
problem
here.
that
problem
is
not
at
all
involved
in
this
case
in
any
way.
the
other
thing
is
that
the
argument
is
made
by
--
in
the
appellees'
brief
that
this
is
--
this
statute
is
not
bad
because
after
all,
the
teacher
is
not
required
to
be
fired.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't
--
it
burdens
but
it
doesn't
punish
speech.
and
we
feel
that
this
does
not
help
support
the
regulation,
because
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
from
thomas
versus
collins
through
the
cases
such
as
the
naacp
versus
alabama
and
bates
versus
little
rock,
that
the
fact
that
the
restriction
does
not
punish,
merely
burden
speech
that
this
does
not
keep
it
from
being
a
violation
and
infringement
of
freedom
of
association.
so
that
the
fact,
as
we
admit,
that
the
school
authorities
are
not
required,
they
are
there
told
that
you
list
this
and
actually
and
in
the
abstract,
once
the
teacher
is
--
list
these
organizations
and
may
well
be,
they
argue,
that
she
will
not
be
required.
and
maybe
membership
in
the
--
in
the
naacp
or
membership
in
the
urban
league
or
these
other
kinds
of
organizations
will
not
require
that
the
teacher
be
fired
and
this,
of
course,
is
true.
but
the
point
is
that
the
restriction
which
is
bear
imposed,
we
feel,
imposes
upon
the
teacher
a
burden
of
what
this
court
has
described
in
smith
versus
california
as
a
self-censorship.
and
because
the
inevitable
result,
we
think,
is
that
the
teacher
being
required
to
list
these
organizations
whatever
they
are,
the
tendency
is
going
to
be
for
the
teacher
to,
therefore,
involve
herself
in
and
be
concerned
with
an
organizational
activities,
only
the
things
that
she
or
he
regards
as
safe
or
the
things
that
will
meet
with
the
approval
of
her
superiors.
now,
this
is
a
kind
of
a
loss
of
freedom,
of
a
sense
of
freedom
of
the
teacher,
which
we
think
would
have
or
we
have
argued
would
have
disastrous
result
on
the
question
of
academic
freedom.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
think
that
the
limits
are
--
the
limits
have
to
be
that
those
that
are
related
to
fitness,
to
her
suitability
and
trustworthiness,
i
think
those
are
the
terms
that
the
court
has
used
in
several
cases
in
the
public
schools.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
then
our
theory
on
that,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
the
state
is
in
no
position
to
determine
in
advance.
it
has
no
reason
to
restrict
it
and
impinge
upon
the
association.
we
think
that
the
state
cannot
say
that
you've
got
to
make
a
--
make
an
inquiry
to
all
of
the
association
relationships
on
the
grounds
that
maybe
they
will
find
one
or
two
if
they
look
through
them
that
may
be
related
to
fitness.
we
think
that
they
have
to
spell
it
out
and
say
that
these
various
organizations
are
related
to
fitness
and
attempt
to
restrict
them.
otherwise,
we
think
that
the
yardsticks
of
the
court
has
drawn
with
respect
to
permissible
limits
on
the
freedom
of
association
would
be
barred.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
that's
one
of
our
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
what
i
would
--
if
it
concerns
--
concerning
itself
with
education,
i
would
think
that
--
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i'm
--
i'm
not
trying
to
avoid
the
question
but
i
would
think
that
that
statute
would
be
closer.
it
may
well,
in
terms
of
the
vagueness,
be
something
that
--
looking
at
it,
we've
--
i
might
not
be
able
to
go
all
the
way,
but
it
would
be
closer
to
what
this
court
has
laid
down
as
the
necessary
limits.
i
would
think
that
that
certainly,
it
could
be
argued
that
an
organization
concerning
itself
with
education
have
some
relevance
to
the
question
of
the
teacher's
fitness
in
the
public
school.
i
don't
know
what
these
organizations
follow.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i've
--
i
think
that
if
you
are
interviewing
--
interviewing
them,
this
man
in
this
kind
of
context
in
which
you
are
asking,
where
do
you
study?
where
did
you
get
any
degree
and
so
forth?
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
--
asking
what
his
associations
are,
that
at
that
point,
you
are
narrowing
your
inquiry
to
association
and
relationships
that
are
relevant
to
the
issue
which
is
before
you
at
this
question
as
to
whether
this
man
is
--
has
the
qualification
which
you
feel
desirable
in
your
school
system.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir,
i
would
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
that
--
i
would
take
the
position
that
that
kind
of
inquiry
is
outside
of
the
--
outside
of
the
competence
and
the
power
of
the
state,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
no
right
that
--
what
he
does
and
what
associational
relationships
he
has
in
terms
of
employment
in
the
school
systems,
it
seems
to
me,
actively
related
to
the
issue
of
who's
with
mr.
teacher,
and
i
thought
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
outside
of
that.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
ell,
it
seems
to
me
if
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
well,
we'll
let
--
we'll
let
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
in
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
--
if
you
have
this
--
if
you'll
make
the
inquiry
about
the
league
of
women
voters,
if
the
court
pleases,
what
you
--
excuse
me.
what
you
are
you
are
doing
when
you
make
this
kind
of
inquiry,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are,
at
that
point,
making
a
restriction
and
a
judgment
on
--
in
respect
to
the
teacher
based
upon
the
exercise
of
a
right
of
freedom
of
association,
and
therefore
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
that
--
i
think
for
example
that
the
reason
i
am
--
i
had
difficulty
when
you
list
organizations
is
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
me
that
there
maybe
organizations.
i
don't
--
i'll
be
frank
with
you,
i
just
don't
know
of
what
organizations,
but
the
fact
that
a
man
is
a
member
of
the
naacp
or
the
league
of
women
voters
or
so
forth
and
so
on
or
believes
in
them,
what
organization
that
has
in
terms
of
his
relevance
to
teach,
but
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
it
may
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
then
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
when
he
--
what
he
thinks
about
and
what
he
says
in
terms
of
whether
it's
wrong
or
not,
it
seems
to
me,
it
doesn't
have
any
--
you're
not
talking
in
terms
of
his
thought
processes
that
he
has
expressed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
not
with
respect
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
that's
right.
but
i
think
that
when
you
start
listing
specific
organizations
that
you
take
this
out
of
this
kind
of
--
this
kind
of
statute
that
we
have
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
you
asked
a
man,
for
example,
if
you
asked
a
man,
what
he
thinks
of
the
naacp,
what
he
thinks
of
the
league
of
women
voters.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
you
ask
him
that,
i
don't'
think
that
you're
--
you
are
therefore
asking
him
whether
he
belongs
to
the
organization
or
not.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
would
think
so,
yes.
i
would
think
that
if
--
on
the
basis
of
that
you
feel
that
some
information
in
regard
to
that
might
be
helpful
in
your
determination,
yes.
i
think
that
you'd
be
entitled
to
asking
him.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
my
difficulty,
as
i
say,
is
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
would
feel
that
to
ask
a
man
in
terms
of
what
his
views
were
on
various
problems
in
the
world
today
as
evidence
or
in
the
society's
evidence
by
the
attitudes
of
various
organizations,
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
legitimate
but
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
true.
that's
right.
but
what
i
have
here
and
that
this
is
the
point
that
i
--
here,
if
the
court
--
i
think
that
even
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
or
the
court
below
said
that
what
the
--
what
the
petitioner
or
the
appellants
were
contending
was
that
the
state
had
to
ask
150
questions
instead
of
one,
and
i
think
that
this
is
really
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
case
that
--
the
situation
that
you
were
mentioning.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
there
is
an
important
difference
here
that
if
a
state
feels
that
some
of
these
things
are
relevant
to
the
issue
of
teacher
fitness,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
to
ask
the
150
questions
rather
than
ask
the
one
question,
which
is
going
to
bring
into
play
we
think
is
a
breach
of
the
teachers'
--
total
breach
of
the
teachers'
association
of
freedom.
i
feel
that
this
case,
if
this
statute
is
upheld,
what
it
really
amounts
to
is
that
the
teacher
is,
by
virtue
of
her
teaching,
is
being
deprived
completely
of
any
right
to
freedom
of
association.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
would
--
i
would
hardly
think
so,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
think
that
what
happens
is
that
they
have
--
the
contract
has
to
be
renewed
each
year.
there
are
no
limits
in
terms
of,
as
far
as
i
know,
in
terms
of
reasons
that
the
state
can
have.
if
the
teachers
taught
there
for
50
years,
the
state
may
send
them
a
notice
within
the
statutory
timeline
and
say
we're
not
going
to
employ
for
the
next
year.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
as
far
as
i
--
the
case
cited
by
the
court
below
in
its
opinion,
it
seems
to
--
in
the
opinion
below
which
is
--
we've
set
out
in
the
--
in
the
footnote
as
to
the
statement
of
jurisdiction,
seems
to
stand
for
that
proposition.
i
can
find
it
on
page
--
on
page
31
of
the
stating
of
jurisdiction
in
footnote
3.
i
don't
--
the
statute
--
that
this
is
a
kind
of
teacher
contract
employment,
which
i
think
is
fairly
common
in
some
of
the
states.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
think
it
operates
that
way,
because
i
think
if
a
teacher
--
teacher
has
taught
for
any
length
of
time,
that
--
and
has
taught
satisfactorily
basis,
the
probability
that
you've
realized
or
he
realized,
they
want
to
stay
in
school
system,
they
will
remain.
but
insofar
as
the
bare
legal
proposition
is
concerned,
this
would
be
permissible.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
i
don't
see,
i'm
unable
to
see
the
difference,
and
i
think
that
the
inquiry
which
the
--
if
the
inquiry,
particularly
in
this
kind
of
situation,
if,
as
i
believe
that
the
inquiry
has
to
be
limited
to
the
issue
of
teacher
fitness
and
suitability
to
teacher.
this
is
where
i
think
the
limits
are.
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
may
--
that
the
kinds
of
questions
that
can
be
asked,
we
should
be
the
same
both
for
the
old
teacher
and
the
new
teacher,
because
they
maybe
more
probing
and
maybe
some
of
these
things
you
might
be
able
to
find
more
about.
but
it
seems
to
me
if
it
--
within
these
limitations
that
they
would
be
substantially
the
same.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
come
back
to
the
same
position,
which
i
was
entitled
to
take
in
the
reply
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
state
can't
serve
that
we
--
well,
we
want
to
know
all
about
you.
i
mean
i
feel
they
can
say,
"we
want
to
know
all
about
you,
insofar
as
all
about
you
has
relevance
to
the
issue
of
teaching
in
the
schools."
and
the
state
can't
say
that,
"this
is
difficult.
we
don't'
know,
there
are
a
whole
a
lot
of
things
that
we
may
like
to
find
out,
and
therefore,
we
want
you
to
list
everything."
i
think
the
state
has
to,
itself,
make
a
decision
as
to
what
it
regards
as
being
relevant.
and
in
this
regard,
i
would
make
no
distinction
between
the
old
teacher
and
the
new,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
would
have
to
happen
is
that
the
state
therefore
has
to
ask
the
specific
questions,
which
it
thinks
relates
to
the
issues
which
it
wants
to
bring
out.
otherwise,
it
would
rather
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
this,
to
me,
is
the
rise
of
the
reasoning
below.
i
would
--
i,
of
course,
don't
come
here
saying
that
they
can't
ask
anything,
that
they
are
allowed
to
ask
questions
and
impinge
upon
the
teachers'
freedom
of
association
other
than
the
issue
of
their
loyalty
and
so
forth.
of
course
there's
a
number
of
things
which
determine
fitness,
but
i
think
that
the
state
has
to
spell
that
out
as
to
what
it
thinks
is
related
to.
otherwise,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
--
your
whole
concept
of
the
right
of
freedom
of
association,
which
the
court
has
laid
down,
goes
out
of
the
window.
this
is
our
position.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
under
the
law
of
arkansas,
as
i
understand
it.
well,
i
--
and
i
think
the
law
of
arkansas
has
to
be
embellished
with
the
law
of
due
process,
which
has
been
set
down
by
this
court.
now,
under
the
law
of
arkansas,
as
i
understand
it,
if
those
teachers
are
--
their
contracts
are
not
renewed
without
any
reason,
then
the
teacher
would
have
no
redress
except,
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
due
process
question
would
arise
if
the
teachers
can
show
that
their
failure
to
renew
was
based
upon
their
refusal
to
issue
--
i
mean
to
sign
this
affidavit.
then,
i
think
no
matter
what
the
law
of
arkansas
is
that
this
would
--
this
case
would
at
least
come
here
as
a
federal
due
process
question
which
would
have
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
now,
if
they
gave
no
reasons,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
they
could
not
prove
that
there
was
--
there
were
any
invalid
reasons
and
i
think
that
the
law
of
arkansas,
as
it
is,
is
that
there's
no
redress.
but
i
think
as
i
--
i
don't
remember
the
--
right
off
hand
the
cases,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
last
term,
there
were
several
cases
of
this
kind.
and
the
fact
that
that
the
government
has
the
power
but
--
to
fail
to
renew
--
but
dismisses
or
refuses
to
renew
for
an
unconstitutional
reason,
then
it's
--
then
i
think
that
as
far
as
i
understand
the
law
that
there
is
redress.
now,
i
think
that
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
our
reasons
and
the
correlation
between
what
we
regard
the
--
this
freedom
of
association
of
the
schoolteacher
and
academic
freedom.
we
think
that
this
is
very
clear
and
that
if
you
can't
have
a
free
teacher,
you
aren't
going
to
be
able
to
have
a
teacher
who
is
free
enough
to
instill
any
feeling
of
freedom
of
thought
and
so
forth
in
the
classroom.
the
--
on
the
question
of
this
being
raised
legislation
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
think
on
that
that
i
would
have
to
--
i
think
that
i
would
be
foreclosed
for
making
that
kind
of
argument
by
virtue
of
the
decisions
in
garner
versus
the
board
of
public
works.
i
think
that
the
court
has
said
the
past
conduct
maybe
irrelevant
to
fitness
and
this
is
--
we're
not
making
this
argument
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
on
the
final
point,
if
i
may
hurriedly,
we
think
that
if
--
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
this
was
passed,
as
i
indicated,
at
the
second
extraordinary
session
and
it
was
passed
that
this
is
the
--
with
a
package
of
legislation,
which
was
school
closing
and
intended
to
deal
with
the
whole
question
of
school
segregation.
but
actually,
it
was
intended
to
affect
the
rights
of
teachers
to
participate
in
group
organizations
advocating
integration.
and
on
this
basis,
we
feel
that
this
statute
would
be
bad
for
the
--
under
the
principle
of
the
naacp
versus
alabama
and
bates
versus
little
rock.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
i
would
just
like
to
clarify
one
question
that
was
raised,
i
think
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
as
the
question
of
the
status
to
this
--
as
is
extent,
when
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
broad
--
a
restraining
order
was
secured
in
the
--
in
the
lower
court
and
was
extended
until
here.
thereafter,
after
decision
was
made
striking
down
act
115,
a
stay
was
applied
for
in
the
court
below
and
was
denied
and
we
applied
for
a
stay
here,
which
was
denied
by
the
--
by
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
believe.
so
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
wasn't
--
we
thought
we
were
asking
for
stay
of
the
reach
of
the
statute
until
--
why
we
could
appeal
here.
now,
thereafter,
the
appellant
here,
shelton,
he
had
therefore
refused
to
submit
the
affidavit
and
he
was
dismissed
by
virtue
of
that.
now,
beside
of
this,
that
was
the
only
thing
i
have
in
terms
of
clarification.
