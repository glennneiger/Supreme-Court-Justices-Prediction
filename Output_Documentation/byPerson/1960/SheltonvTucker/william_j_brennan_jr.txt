brennan,

before
you
get
to
that
mr.
carter,
do
the
arguments
you've
just
made
draw
any
support
to
the
fact
that
the
answers
required
are
not
as
to
immediate
memberships
but
as
to
memberships
within
five
years,
last
five
years
or
that
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
the
case
then
mr.
friday
that
each
professor
of
the
university
also
must
annually
sign
this
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
wondered,
mr.
friday,
if
that
is
in
what
section
4
of
the
statutes
would
require.
as
i
understand
that
section
4,
it
provides
that
as
a
violation
by
the
school
district
if
any
contracts
entered
into
with
anyone
who
has
not
filed
an
affidavit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
friday,
are
there
pension
provisions
for
teachers
such
as
this,
pension
on
retirement
are
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
the
--
would
this

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
petitioners'
rights
would
have
been
affected
anywhere
