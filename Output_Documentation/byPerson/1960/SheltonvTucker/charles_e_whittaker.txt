mr.
carter,
act
10
was
held
--
was
it
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
certain
organizations
including
naacp?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
only
of
the
--
and
that
act
was
held
unconstitutional?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
is
quite
embezzling?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
hasn't
been
held
unconstitutional
both
by
the
eighth
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
and
also
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there's
been
any
ruling
by
your
attorney
general
that
it
is
confidential
in
nature?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
didn't
the
supreme
court
in
your
state
intimate
that
in
the
opinion
--
its
opinion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
were
asking
for
more
than
stay.
you
were
asking
me
to
make
effective
what
this
(inaudible)
have
denied,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
do
you
interpret
this
language
of
the
court,
record
134
saying,
"in
as
much
as
the
validity
of
the
act
depends
upon
its
being
construed
has
bona
fide
legislation
--
legislative
effort
to
provide
school
boards
with
needed
information?
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
affidavits
need
not
be
opened
to
public
instructions,
where
the
permissible
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
enlighten
the
school
board
alone."
now,
isn't
that
a
holding
by
the
court
that
the
only
permissible
purpose
is
to
enlighten
the
school
board?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
does
that
give
effect
of
the
phrase
for
the
permissible
purpose
of
the
statute,
is
to
enlighten
the
school
board
alone.
do
you
give
any
effect
to
those
words?
