now,
that
law
was
not
passed
to
the
same
--
the
same
legislative
question.

that
law
has
been
held
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court
--
justice

it
was
not

supreme
court
prior,
before
us,
is
that
right?

mr.
carter,
because
of
the
lack
of
tenure
in
arkansas,
which
apparently
is
true,
are
these
teachers
all
in
the
same
status
as
if
they
were
new
applicants
for
jobs
each
year?
justice

would
you
thing
there
might
then
be
a
difference
between
what
the
state
or
the
public
school
system
could
ask
a
brand-new
applicant
for
a
job
about
whom
the
system
would
know
nothing,
that
there
might
be
a
difference
between
what
the
state
could
constitutionally
ask
from
such
an
applicant,
and/or
the
state
could
constitutionally
ask
of
its
existing
teachers
about
whom
it
presumably
knows
a
good
deal
insofar
as
their
teaching
ability
goes
and
their
experiences?

well,
i'm
not
assuming
you
have
a
new
teacher,
i'm
assuming
you
have
somebody
who's
never
taught,
who
has
never
had
implication
to
experience
academic
freedom.
he
just
comes
and
applies
and
he
wants
a
job
in
the
arkansas
public
school
system.
do
you
think
arkansas
would
say,
"well,
we
don't
know
anything
about
you,
would
you
please
list
the
--
your
various
vital
statistics
including
the
organizations
to
which
you
would
belong?"
might
it
not
be
relevant
if
he
says
he's
a
member
of
the,
i
don't
know,
with
the
bartender's
union
and
so
on,
and
just
as
his
educational
qualifications
would
be
relevant.
justice
potter
stewart
for
a
--
for
a
new
person
whom
this
school
system
knew
nothing.
