mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
little
rock
school
district
which
is
one
of
the
two
respondents
in
this
case.
the
other
respondent
is
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
university
of
arkansas,
in
this
instance,
represented
by
the
attorney
general
of
arkansas
who
has
filed
a
brief
in
the
case.
the
assistant
attorney
general
is
the
present
in
the
counsel
table
but
has
asked
me
to
advise
the
court
that
his
differing
argument
to
us
in
this
instance.
i'd
like
to
mention
first
mr.
dunaway's
argument
that
the
--
the
information
contained
in
the
affidavits
is
public
information
or
it
amounts
to
that.
of
course,
the
attorney
general's
opinion
is
in
the
record
in
which
he
states
that
in
his
opinion,
the
information
contained
in
--
in
the
affidavits
is
subject
to
such
publication
as
the
school
board's
in
their
discretion,
might
give
it.
that
opinion
antedated
the
supreme
court's
opinion
which
authoritatively
construed
the
meaning
of
act
10
and
the
supreme
--
supreme
court
of
arkansas
of
course
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
pointed
out,
said
that
the
permissible
purpose
of
the
statute
is
enlighten
school
boards
alone
and
i
think
in
light
of
that
construction
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas,
it
would
be
an
ill-advised
school
board
that
would
give
any
other
use
to
the
information
contained
in
these
affidavits.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
certainly,
if
it
is
not
a
holding
it’s
a
caveat
to
that
effect.
i
--
i
think
it's
a
clear
indication
by
the
court
with
regard
to
what
it
construes,
what
the
statute
means
and
what
the
legislature
meant.
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
i
--
i
think
that
language
that
it
need
not
be
used
in
any
other
way
preceded
in
the
same
paragraph,
the
language
that
the
permissible
purpose
is
to
enlighten
the
school
board
alone.
and
i
--
i
think
the
court
was
working
up
to
that
that.
it
says
the
statute
clearly
doesn't
require
that
that
it
be
made
public
and
that
it
need
not
be
made
public
under
the
language
of
the
statute
and
then
the
court
said,
"the
permissible
purpose
is
to
enlighten
the
school
board
alone.
that
seems
to
--
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
assumed
too
much
throughout
their
brief,
throughout
their
presentation
in
this
because
the
assumption
is
and
the
argument
just
made
is
that
discharge
or
the
hounding
of
the
academic
people,
public
employees,
school
employees
will
necessarily
follow
compliance
with
act
10,
but
there's
no
showing
made
in
this
record
to
that
effect.
there's
no
showing
such
as
there
was
in
naacp
against
alabama
or
bates
against
little
rock
that
actually,
any
such
harmful
effects,
objectionable
activities
came
about
as
a
result
of
disclosing
the
information
that
is
required
in
act
10.
the
record
does
show
that
four
people
refused
to
execute
the
affidavit
out
of
800
in
the
little
rock
public
school
system.
the
record
shows
that
one
professor
at
the
university
of
arkansas
out
of
the
entire
staff
there,
refused
to
execute
the
affidavit.
the
record
in
the
case
just
argued
prior
to
this
of
course
shows
that
no
one
in
the
pine
law
school
district,
no
one
in
the
arkansas
am&n
college,
refused
to
execute
it.
so
we
have
in
the
records
in
these
two
cases,
only
five
persons
out
of
some
16,000
as
the
record
indicates,
there
are
some
16,000
public
school
employees,
classified
employees,
instruction
employees
in
arkansas,
out
of
some
16,000,
only
five
as
far
as
this
record
reflects
and
as
far
as
i
know,
had
been
directly
affected
to
the
extent
that
they
have
been
--
their
employment
have
been
terminated
for
refusal
to
execute
the
affidavit.
now
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
have
they
been
filed
in
this
court,
no
sir,
no,
sir.
if
–
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
am
sure
that
i
could
cooperate
with
mr.
dunaway
in
getting
them
up
after
we
have
returned
to
little
rock.
i
believe
we
could
withdraw
them.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
justice
black,
i
will
defer
that
question
if
i
may
to
mr.
dunaway
when
he
returns.
he
argued
this
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
and
i
did
not,
so
i
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
with
regard
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
--
you
--
you
mean
that
was
the
legislative,
they
required
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
judge,
i
--
i
couldn't
tell
you
anything
on
that
further
than
the
usual
matter
of
filing
the
license.
i
do
know
that
it
is
required
to
--
a
public
school
teacher
penalizing
from
the
state
board
of
education
and
of
course
that
has
to
be
presented
to
the
employing
board
and
the
information
required
to
obtain
the
license
i
--
i
am
not
familiar
with
what
goes
into
that.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
in
reference
to
the
number
of
people
that
there
are
in
arkansas
subject
to
this
act,
some
16,000
and
that
on
this
record
we
have
only
five
who
have
not
complied.
that
is
against
this
broad
background
of
compliance
with
the
act
and
the
act
has
been
in
effect
two
years.
it
became
effective
in
september
of
1958,
applied
to
the
renewal
of
contracts
for
the
1959-1960
academic
year
and
again
the
renewal
of
contracts
for
the
current
1960-1961
academic
year.
some
16,000
people
complying
with
it
on
both
occasions
and
we
have
not
a
word
in
the
record
showing
the
harmful
effects
which
the
petitioners
predict
but
do
not
prove
in
this
record.
mr.
robert
v.
light
this
case,
mr.
justice
black,
was
tried
in
the
summer
of
last
year
in
the
--
in
june
or
july
in
my
recollection,
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
in
about
december.
mr.
robert
v.
light
unless
it
were
put
in
the
record
by
stipulation
of
course,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
don't
believe
that
the
contents
of
any
of
the
affidavits
are
in
the
record
except
the
two
affidavits
presented
by
the
two
petitioners
in
this
case
which
were
in
--
or
not
two
--
affidavits
were
filed
by
act
10
of
course
for
the
affidavits
that
they
were
putting
in
lieu
of
that
for
the
purpose
of
their
of
their
loss.
i
believe
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
with
regard
to
the
content
of
the
affidavits
obtained
from
the
other
16,000
school
teachers.
mr.
robert
v.
light
mr.
justice
black,
subject
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
that
they
have
not
discharged
any
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
there
have
been
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
there
have
been
five.
four
school
teachers
in
the
littler
rock
school
system,
that's
in
the
record
and
mr.
carr,
the
professor
in
the
university
of
arkansas
is
the
fifth
one,
five
discharged
for
refusal
to
--
to
comply
with
the
act.
now,
in
the
--
your
question,
i
--
i
misunderstood
you.
i'm
sure
your
question
was,
how
may
have
been
fired
as
result
to
the
information
they
gave
in,
in
compliance
with
it.
mr.
robert
v.
light
i
--
i
think
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
that.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
no,
sir.
i
--
i
believe
there
is
nothing
with
regard
to
the
contents
of
the
affidavits
filed
by
all
the
other
people
in
the
state.
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
now,
of
course,
there's
--
there
is
also
not
in
the
record,
any
indication
--
anyone
been
fired,
any
indication
that
any
association
or
organization
has
lost
members
or
that
a
teacher
has
quit
an
association
or
organization
as
the
result
of
this
or
that
any
teacher
been
subject
to
any
intimidation
or
coercion
or
action
by
private
individuals
which
would
come
to
this
--
in
this
interplay
of
private
parties
and
governmental
action.
there's
--
there's
nothing
at
all
in
the
record
to
that
effect
and
that
could've
easily
been
put
in
the
record
as
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
if
they
quit.
mr.
robert
v.
light
your
honor,
it
has
been
--
yes,
i
have
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
i
--
i
am
feel
perfectly
justified
in
arguing
that
this
court
can
safely
assume
that
there
had
been
no
such
harmful
effects
to
--
to
the
remaining
school
teachers
in
the
system
when
there
is
no
evidence
as
there
was
in
the
naacp
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
yes,
sir.
in
--
in
naacp
against
alabama,
there
was
testimony
in
the
record.
as
i
understood
the
decision
in
that
case
to
the
effect
that
the
naacp
membership
had
dropped
in
alabama
as
a
result
of
this
prospective
exposure
and
the
same
thing
in
the
bates
case,
bates
against
little
rock
as
i
understood
that
--
that
that
testimony
was
put
in
the
record.
we
--
we
don't
have
here.
we
have
an
absence
of
it
and
i
think
in
the
absence
of
such
a
showing
that
can
be
so
easily
made
that
the
safe
assumption
is
there
has
been
no
such
harmful
effect.
mr.
robert
v.
light
if
act
115
were
constitutional,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
v.
light
certainly
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
act
115
was
passed
during
the
regular
session
in
january
or
february
of
1959.
mr.
robert
v.
light
the
suit
--
this
suit
that
has
just
been
argued
prior
to
ours
was
instituted
along
about
april
1st,
in
my
recollection,
in
a
temporary
restraining
order,
restraining
the
enforcement
of
act
115,
was
promptly
thereafter
entered,
in
my
recollection
on
that.
and
therefore,
we
did
not
have
a
situation
at
contract
renewal
time
which
is
in
may
as
the
school
term
is
approaching
or
close
at
the
end
of
may.
we
didn't
have
a
situation
of
act
115
being
--
ostensibly
on
the
book
where
it
would
need
to
be
enforced
because
of
the
temporary
restraining
order
then
in
effect
at
the
time
the
contracts
were
being
renewed
for
the
forthcoming
1959-1960
school
year.
so
act
115
never
was
a
legitimate
threat
in
reference
to
a
--
to
depriving
anyone
in
the
public
schools
of
employment
in
arkansas
because
the
contracts
of
employment
been
in
effect,
did
not
come
up
for
renewal
until
such
time
that
the
court
had
already
entered
in
taking
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
and
shortly
thereafter,
i
believe
in
june
of
--
it
declared
act
115
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
v.
light
like
act
10,
one
now
before
this
court,
not
that
i'm
--
mr.
robert
v.
light
not
--
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
mr.
justice
black.
in
final
reference
to
the
assumptions
and
presumptions
being
made
in
the
absence
in
the
record
of
any
showing
that
there
has
been
a
harmful
effect
from
anyone.
i
think
that
it
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
in
order
to
accept
the
petitioners'
position,
that
there
will
flow
from
the
mere
existence
of
act
10
on
the
books
and
compliance
with
it,
there
will
flow,
these
harmful
effects
of
people
leaving
organizations
of
having
their
right
to
associate
impinged
upon
and
their
privacy
invaded.
it'd
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
presume
that
the
school
board
members
and
the
members
of
the
boards
of
trustees
at
various
colleges
in
the
state
will
violate
their
oaths
to
maintain
and
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
put
this
information
they
gained
through
the
state
act
to
an
improper
and
under
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
an
impermissible
use
and
that’s
where
that
court
had
ever
made
a
presumption
of
that
character
with
reference
to
prospective
acts
of
public
offices.
i
guess
the
background
of
the
facts
with
regard
to
what
the
operation
of
the
act
has
been
for
a
period
of
two
years
that
it
hasn't,
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
has
any
--
had
the
harmful
effects
that
are
predicted,
that
are
feared
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
it
seems
appropriate
to
examine
the
position
the
school
authorities
would
be
in,
in
the
event
that
the
act
was
struck
down.
under
the
act,
they
can
and
of
course
they
are
required
to
inquire
into
all
organizational
associations
of
school
teachers
and
prospective
school
teachers.
if
the
court
holds
that
they
cannot
do
this
because
some
of
the
organizations
that
would,
thus
be
revealed
or
disclosed
would
be
irrelevant
--
membership
and
it
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
fitness
and
suitability
to
serve
as
a
public
school
teacher.
what
position
is
the
school
board's
and
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
--
of
the
state
colleges
in
at
that
time.
are
they
to
request
as
i
understood
mr.
dunaway
to
suggest
and
as
the
affidavit
filed
in
these
two
cases
by
these
two
petitioners,
the
affidavit
will
say
through
themselves
would
seem
to
suggest
to
suggest
that
what
they
would
prefer
to
do
is
the
board
asked
the
employee
to
list
all
associations
to
which
he
has
become
a
member
which
he
is
associated
that
might
be
relevant
to
the
question
of
his
suitability
and
fitness
as
a
teacher,
in
other
words,
allow
the
prospective
public
employee
to
make
the
determination
of
relevancy.
on
the
other
hand
are
they
to
request
the
employee
to
furnish
information
with
regard
to
specific
organizations
that
the
school
boards
and
there
are
some
422,
i
believe,
that
arkansas
have
determined
as
a
result
of
an
extensive
independent
investigation
that
are
relevant.
in
other
words,
of
the
thousands
of
organizations
that
exist
in
arkansas
and
every
other
state
as
each
school
board
to
be
required
to
make
an
extensive
examination
to
find
out
which
organizations
it
would
feel
relevant
to
inquire
of
its
employees
if
there
--
if
they
are
members.
and
both
of
those
suggestions
and
both,
i
believe,
been
seriously
advanced
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
seem
to
be
holding
impractical
and
it
does
not
say
that
they
--
that
any
constitutional
right
requires
placing
a
burden
of
this
character
of
the
second
suggestion
on
the
school
board
or
making
such
a
fruitless
and
impossible
type
of
--
of
requirement
as
to
allow
the
employee
to
make
his
own
decision
on
relevancy
as
the
two
petitioners
in
this
case
have.
i
would
suggest
in
closing
that
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
was
correct
in
its
analysis
when
it
said
we're
not
persuaded
that
the
constitution
compels
the
board
to
ask
scores
or
hundreds
of
questions
one
by
one
instead
of
making
the
blanket
in,
where
it
required
in
act
10.
