mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
we
appear
in
this
case
as
attorneys
for
pine
bluff
school
district
no.
3
and
arkansas
am&n
college.
arkansas
am&n
college
is
the
college
that
was
founded
in
the
late
1800s
for
the
negro
citizens
of
our
state
and
possibly,
you
haven't
heard
quite
as
much
about
pine
bluff
as
you've
heard
from
our
sister
city
of
little
rock,
and
so
i
should
tell
you
that
we
are
about
45
miles
from
little
rock
and
arkansas
am&n
college
is
located
there.
we
represent
the
school
district
and
the
college.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
i
would
agree
sir.
i
would
say
this
that
here,
answering
your
question
earlier
mr.
justice
frankfurter
about
the
number
of
faculty
at
arkansas
am&n
college,
there
are
approximately
100
professors
there
or
teachers
and
with
the
administrative
staff,
there
are
about
160
there.
and
that
would
be
one
of
the
colleges
that
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
exclusive
of
the
university.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir
it
is.
as
--
as
indicated
in
the
record,
neither
of
the
clients
whom
we
represent
in
this
cause
are
here
because
of
any
failure
on
the
part
of
any
teacher
or
professor
to
sign
the
act
10
affidavit.
we
were
brought
into
this
case
after
the
original
action
had
been
filed.
subsequently,
an
amended
complaint
was
filed
making
arkansas
am&n
college
and
pine
bluff
school
district
no.
3
parties
in
order
that
there
would
be
a
class
action.
and
so
at
that
time,
we
did
raise
a
question
in
the
lower
court
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
was
a
justiciable
issue
or
whether
there
was
actually
a
case
or
controversy,
but
we
were
overruled
there
and
did
not
pursue
that
in
this
appeal
here.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
in
this
--
in
our
case
your
honor,
i
said,
no
one
had
been
dismissed
or
had
failed
to
do
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
as
far
as
we
were
concerned,
we
didn't
feel
that
there
was
one.
we
were
brought
in
as
a
class
action
to
make
it
a
class
action
since
the
plaintiff
here
filed,
for
themselves
and
other
similarly
situated,
in
order
to
make
it
a
class
action.
now,
as
far
as
pine
bluff
school
district
no.
3,
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
there
were
approximately
275
teachers.
that
259
had
already
complied
with
the
act
and
that
16
had
left
the
school
system
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
normal
attrition
i
suppose
of
school
teachers
getting
married
at
first
one
thing
and
another.
but
in
any
event,
none
of
them
were
dismissed
or
not
rehired
for
their
failure
to
sign
the
affidavit.
now,
with
reference
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
no,
sir.
[laughter]
i
can't
tell
that
court
why
we
were
selected
except
you
will
notice
in
the
brief
that
they
said
pine
bluff
is
an
area
near
the
center
of
the
state,
and
of
course,
the
arkansas
am&n
college
being
there,
i'm
sure
that
that
was
one
factor
in
selecting
us
as
a
class
defendant.
now,
with
reference
to
the
college,
i
might
say
that
the
restraining
order
was
issued
prior
to
the
time
that
the
contracts
for
the
college
were
issued.
now,
that
wasn't
true
as
far
as
pine
bluff
school
district
3.
they
had
already
gone
through
with
their
procedure
of
hiring
and
their
contracts
had
been
executed
at
the
time
the
hearing
in
the
lower
court
was
held.
we
submit,
as
far
as
our
people
are
concerned,
our
clients
in
this
case
that
we
can't
agree
with
the
basic
assumption
that
seems
to
run
through
the
brief
filed
in
here
by
the
appellant.
and
that
is
that
the
school
districts
will
not
act
properly
with
reference
to
the
information
which
comes
from
these
affidavits.
now,
as
i
suggested
to
you,
the
only
thing
that
we
have
in
the
record
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
involving
either
arkansas
am&n
college
or
pine
bluff
school
district
no.
3
is
a
fact
that
they
were
executed,
the
contracts
were
given
out,
and
apparently,
caused
no
great
problem
in
connection
with
it.
so,
i
think
that
we
cannot
agree
with
the
position
taken
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
that
there
will
be
an
area
of
fear
or
they
would
be
afraid
to
sign
the
affidavits,
they
can't
continue
to
teach,
and
there
would
be
a
mass
exodus
from
the
systems.
that
isn't
true
as
far
as
the
facts
show
in
this
particular
case.
i
would
have
to
say
that
that's
conjecture
or
speculation
and
isn't
bourne
out
by
what
we
held
before
you
in
this
particular
case.
i
would
have
to
proceed
on
the
basis
that
school
districts,
their
directors
are
fair
and
impartial
people,
that
they
do
the
best
job
that
they
can
under
the
existing
law,
and
i
am
certain
as
shown
by
the
evidence
here
in
this
case
that
they
have
not
supplied
any
information
that
has
been
promulgated
or
shown
by
the
affidavits
in
the
cases
which
we
have
before
you.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
certainly,
sir
.certainly,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
it
comes
in
--
in
the
next
--
in
january,
sir,
of
1961.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
certainly
good.
now,
as
--
if
the
court
said,
i
think
in
the
garner
case
with
reference
to
knowledge
and
good
faith,
i
believe
in
that
case,
there
was
an
oath
and
the
court
i
believe,
by
mr.
justice
clark
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
case
and
he
said
that
he
assumed.
the
court
was
speaking.
they
assume
that
the
board
of
public
works
in
los
angeles
would
apply
the
oath
in
good
faith
or
allow
them
to
take
to
in
good
faith.
i
think
that
we
--
the
same
assumption
is
true
here.
i
believe
that
the
school
districts
are
entitled
to
a
basis
that
they
would
apply
the
act
in
good
faith
and
certainly,
that
there
could
be
some
information
that
would
be
very
relevant
and
very
pertinent,
both
as
to
suitability
and
to
fitness
that
would
apply
in
the
affidavits
that
are
required
by
the
act.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
will
be
in
the
carr
case
which
is
the
next
one
up
in
which
i'm
not
in,
but
i
think
i
can
answer
that
question
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
--
because
it's
cited
in
the
brief
that
we
have
in
this
case.
the
president
of
the
university
of
arkansas
stated
that
those
affidavits
were
not
available
to
the
public
and
were
kept
as
confidential
information
and
i
believe
that
that
is
true
of
the
school
districts
that
i'm
familiar
with,
at
least.
and
i
think
it
comes
down
to
the
bare
facts
of
these,
when
we
get
right
down
to
the
lead
of
the
case
as
whether
the
information
required
in
these
affidavits
that
is
their
organizations,
professional,
business,
academic,
if
that
has
any
relevance
to
their
suitability
or
fitness
for
the
job
of
the
teacher.
we
submit
that
properly
applied
that
it
certainly
could
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
not
be
properly
applied
in
the
case
that
we
have
before
the
court.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
i
--
i
believe
that's
all,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
answer
to
that
question.
it
will
probably
be
applicable
in
the
next
case
which
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
i
might
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
my
assumption
would
be
that
it
would
be
the
board
of
trustees.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
it's
appointed
over
a
staggered
period
of
time
with
the
ratification
by
the
senate,
i
believe.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
appointed
by
the
governor,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
in
the
school
districts,
they
are
elected
by
the
people,
your
honor.
the
board,
as
far
as
the
colleges
are
concerned,
are
appointed
by
the
governor.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
all
of
them,
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
be
about
seven
or
eight,
on
most
of
the
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir,
we
have
8
there.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
i
believe
that
there
had
and
i
believe
that
they
held
that
they
were
of
confidential
nature.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
so.
i
believe
mr.
george
rose
smith,
justice
george
rose
smith,
speaking
in
the
opinion
that
was
written
in
that
case.
it
was
said
that
if
they
should
not
vote,
not
vote
in
confidential,
then
of
course,
that
will
get
into
a
--
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
the
administrators
of
the
school
your
honor.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
well,
i
think
certainly,
the
board
of
trustees
or
the
school
board
themselves,
would
be
entitled
to
that
information.
mr.
louis
l.
ramsay,
jr.
thank
you,
sir.
