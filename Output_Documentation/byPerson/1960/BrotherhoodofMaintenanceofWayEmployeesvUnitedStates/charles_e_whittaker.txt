that's
the
matter
of
invalid
judgment,
if
he'd
seen
this,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say
the
statute,
as
it's
now
drawn
is
ambiguous?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
this
interpretation
is
a
matter
of
explaining
completely.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but,
you
don't
say
that
the
statute
as
it
stands
now,
5
(f),
means
anything
different
than
it
would've
meant
had
the
harrington
amendment
been
adopted
instead
of
rejected?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how's
that
benefit
the
construction,
mr.
mahoney,
of
this
5
(f),
since
its
passage
by
both
parties,
including
your
union,
that
the
words
“not
in
a
worse
position”
shall
be
obtained
and
that
status
shall
be
obtained
by
financial
adjustments?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder,
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
how
they
would
know
in
advance
how
many
would
refuse.
is
that
a
matter
of
averages?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
wasn't
that
the
position
taken
by
the
executive
department
in
their
criticism
to
the
congress
that
the
harrington
amendment
would
freeze
jobs
and
leave
the
policies
of
the
national
transportation
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
say
about
these
dual
accounting
systems
that
would
result
in
cleveland,
in
answer
to
mr.
mcafee?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
about
choosing
the
seniority
of
the
two
roads?
