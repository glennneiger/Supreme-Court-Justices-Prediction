mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
there
is
only
one
issue
in
this
case,
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
required
to
condition
all
railroad
mergers
and
other
consolidations
and
i
shall
use
those
words
very
loosely,
upon
terms
preserving
jobs
for
all
the
employees
employed
before
the
merger
or
might
permit
the
dismissal
of
unnecessary
employees
upon
guaranteeing
them
against
all
loss
or
other
prejudice
to
a
system
of
100%
financial
compensation.
it
may
give
some
perspective
i
think,
if
i
were
to
state
first,
our
understanding
of
the
statute
as
a
whole.
it
appears
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief.
the
first
sentence
directs
the
commission
to
require
a
fair
and
equitable
arrangement
to
protect
the
interest
of
railroad
employees
affected
by
a
merger
or
consolidation.
these
words
obviously
delegate
a
very
broad
discretion,
including
the
power,
as
this
court
held
in
the
railway
labor
executives'
case,
to
require
protection
going
beyond
the
statutory
four-year
minimum.
then
the
second
sentence,
which
is
the
crux
of
this
--
is
the
crux
of
this
case,
i
dwell
at
the
moment
only
to
point
out
that
it
fulfills
a
useful
purpose
either
under
the
appellants'
interpretation
or
under
ours.
for
under
either
interpretation,
it
guarantees
a
minimum
degree
of
protection
below
which
the
commission
may
not
see
--
sink.
four
years
guarantee
a
minimum
in
amount,
100%
guarantee
against
financial
loss
and
a
guarantee
in
length
of
time,
the
four
years
that
i've
mentioned.
then
the
third
sentence,
preserves
the
right
to
the
parties
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
upon
the
consequences
of
a
merger,
including
as
the
court
has
held
although
not
in
a
direct
interpretation
of
this
section,
including
the
right
to
bargain
about
whether
unnecessary
jobs
will
be
preserved
or
at
least,
will
not
be
discontinued
without
the
ascent
of
the
union.
i
emphasize
therefore,
that
there
is
no
question
here
either
about
collective
bargaining
or
about
whether
the
railroad
has
a
duty
to
protect
employees
against
the
consequences
of
a
merger.
the
day
for
arguing
those
issues
is
passed.
in
either
event
here,
there
is
to
be
for
the
statutory
period,
full
protection
against
being
worse
off.
the
only
question
is
how
shall
it
be
achieved?
is
it
to
be
achieved
by
what
we
have
called
a
job
freeze
and
i
accept
mr.
mahoney's
interpretation
of
a
freeze
of
comparable
--
a
freeze
in
comparable
jobs
and
comparable
wages,
which
is
all
we
mean
by
the
expression,
“job
freeze”
or
is
it
to
be
through
full
financial
protection?
the
commission's
order
in
the
present
case
not
only
gives
the
most
elaborate
protection
ever
known
in
the
railroad
industry,
but
a
degree
of
protection
which
goes
far
beyond
anything
known
outside
the
railroad
industry.
displaced
employees,
those
whose
jobs
are
abolished
and
who
exercise
seniority
rights
to
move
into
other
less
well-paying
positions,
are
guaranteed
a
monthly
displacement
allowance
equal
to
difference
between
their
prior
average
earnings
and
what
they
earned
in
the
new
job.
what
the
commission
calls
dismissed
employees
and
what
i
would
call
laid
off
employees
because
the
employment
relationship
isn't
terminated,
they
still
have
seniority
rights,
those
who
lose
their
jobs
as
a
result
of
the
merger,
are
guaranteed
a
--
the
full
average
wage
which
they
earned
in
the
year
preceding
the
merger,
so
that
they
are
protected
there
too.
in
addition,
every
employee
affected
by
the
merger,
whether
he's
dismissed
or
laid
off,
is
guaranteed
all
the
other
incidental
benefits
attached
to
his
previous
employment,
free
transportation,
hospital
and
medical
insurance,
pensions,
things
of
that
kind,
whatever
done
through
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
though
it's
not
all.
every
employee
who
is
forced
to
move
is
guaranteed
his
full
moving
expenses
and
finally,
anyone
who
is
forced
to
sell
his
house
or
to
cancel
a
lease
is
guaranteed
against
any
loss
by
reason
of
that
transaction
and
these
benefits
all
run
for
the
full
statutory
period
or
in
some
cases,
they
may
run
still
longer.
it's
really
a
little
hard
to
think
of
any
way
in
which
you
could
do
more
to
prevent
employees
from
being
worse
off
because
of
a
merger,
but
i
would
emphasize
that
in
this
case
in
any
event,
there
is
no
question
about
the
adequacy
of
the
commission's
order,
if
financial
protection
can
ever
meet
the
statutory
requirement
because
the
appellants
stipulated
in
the
court
below
that
the
only
question
concerned
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
if
there
are
any
financial
inadequacies
in
the
order,
they've
suggested
some
in
the
brief,
they
are
both
excluded
by
the
stipulation,
but
i
should
also
say
that,
under
section
5
(9)
of
the
statute,
they
have
the
right
to
go
back
before
the
commission
and
ask
for
this
additional
protection.
and
the
commission
has
authorized
me
to
say
that
any
such
request
would
certainly
be
considered
and
if
i
read
the
railroad's
brief
right,
they've
said
that
they
will
grant
any
additional
financial
protection,
if
it
were
shown
that
the
commission's
order
fell
short.
mr.
archibald
cox
then,
the
amount
of
the
wages
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
he
earned
would
be
deducted.
there
is
a
provision
for
that
in
the
order.
similarly,
because
of
the
stipulation,
i
would
emphasize
that
there
was
no
question
here
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
sustain
the
commission's
finding
that
financial
compensation
is
the
most
satisfactory
way
of
both
protecting
the
employees
and
permitting
the
merger
to
go
forward.
there's
an
explicit
finding
on
that
point.
it's
not
challenged.
indeed,
the
evidence
isn't
even
here
before
the
court.
so
that
the
chief,
indeed,
the
only
real
difference
between
the
kind
of
job
freeze
that
the
appellants
see
and
the
terms
and
conditions
prescribed
by
the
commission
is
that
the
appellants
would
force
the
carriers
to
provide
jobs
for
unnecessary
employees,
whereas,
the
order
permits
a
reduction
of
forces
upon
consolidating
facilities,
but
guarantees
the
employees
against
all
forms
of
financial
injury.
mr.
mcafee,
the
counsel
for
the
carriers,
will
deal
with
this
in
more
detail.
i
would,
because
of
the
questions
about
it
earlier,
like
to
speak
to
the
point
just
very
briefly.
i
take
it
that
what
mr.
mahoney
means
by
the
employees
are
entitled
to
comparable
jobs,
is
that
an
engineer
is
entitled
to
continue
to
be
an
engineer
and
an
electrician
is
entitled
to
continue
to
be
an
electrician.
you
can't
put
an
engineer
toward
trek
walking
or
keeping
books
or
doing
clerical
work,
because
they
would
say,
“for
obvious
reasons
in
the
craft
history
of
the
industry,
that
that
was
not
a
comparable
job.”
so
what
you
have
to
do
if
consolidation
for
example,
of
the
--
the
yard
facilities
at
buffalo,
which
is
one
of
the
important
parts
here,
makes
it
necessary
to
have
only
half
as
many
train
crews
in
the
yard.
something
has
to
be
done
with
those
other
train
crews.
they
can't
be
put
to
clerical
work,
they
could
be
moved,
if
they
had
other
trains
to
run,
they
could
be
moved
from
the
yard
to
some
kind
of
transfer
service
or
something
like
that,
but
they
would
still,
under
his
interpretation,
have
to
run
trains
whether
there
was
any
need
for
them
or
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
could
be
moved
--
they
could
be
moved
to
another
point,
i
think.
i
--
i'd
like
to
leave
that
to
mr.
mcafee,
because
i
am
not
clear
whether
the
privilege
of
moving
them
overrides
the
seniority
arrangements
at
the
other
point.
you
see
each
--
each
seniority
district
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
treats
others
like
foreigners.
so
that
so
far
as
the
commission's
order
goes
or
what
he
thinks
should
be
the
commission's
order
goes,
it
could
be,
but
i
suspect
that
these
other
seniority
districts
would
object
to
their
moving
in
and
taking
any
of
the
jobs
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
in
that
district.
if
you
put
them
on
the
bottom
and
provided
enough
jobs
so
that
there
was
room
for
everybody
on
the
old
seniority
list
at
the
district,
plus
these
new
fellows,
then
you
could
move
them
to
another
point,
yes.
against
this
background,
i
come
to
the
meaning
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
but
i
would
like
if
i
may,
to
postpone
the
specific
discussion
of
the
words
until
we
come
to
their
place
in
the
chronological
evolution
of
this
unique
degree
of
protection
of
employees
in
the
railroad
industry.
the
history
begins
with
the
enactment
of
the
emergency
railroad
transportation
act
of
1933.
section
7
(b),
which
appears
on
page
24
of
our
brief,
set
a
formula
below
which
the
number
of
employees
in
the
industry
could
not
be
reduced
and
then,
went
on
and
provided,
“nor
shall
any
employee
in
such
service
be
deprived
of
employment
such
as
he
had
during
the
month
of
may,”
which
was
the
lease
period,
“nor
be
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
his
compensation
for
such
employment.”
that
would
cover
the
case
when
he
was
displaced,
by
reason
of
any
action
taken
under
the
act
and
so
forth.
now,
this
enactment
clearly
does
provide
for
what
i
call
a
job
freeze.
i
emphasize
only
that
it
--
when
congress
desired
to
do
this,
it
very
clearly
used
the
language
of
a
job
freeze.
in
the
contrast
to
the
present
law,
are
they
--
needs
to
be
mentioned.
the
next
development
was
the
washington
job
protection
agreement
of
1936.
this
was
negotiated
between
about
80%
of
the
mileage
of
the
railroads
and
carriers
and
the
standard
railway
labor
organizations.
and
it
becomes
the
basis
of
all
subsequent
progress
in
this
field
and
consequently,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
look
at
it
in
some
detail.
turning
to
page
142
of
the
record,
section
6
of
the
agreement
--
i
confine
myself
to
the
key
section,
section
6
of
the
agreement
--
mr.
archibald
cox
142.
section
6
is
just
below
the
middle
of
the
page.
it
provided
what
was
called
a
displacement
allowance
for
employees
who
were
kept
in
service,
but
transferred
to
other
positions.
and
it
read
in
the
critical
part,
“no
employee
of
any
of
the
carriers
involved
in
a
particular
coordination,”
which
was
their
word
for
all
mergers,
consolidations,
leases
and
everything
else,
“who
has
continued
in
service,
shall
prepare
to
five
years,
following
the
effective
date
of
such
coordination,
be
placed
as
a
result
of
such
coordination,
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
compensation
and
rules
governing
working
conditions”
and
then
over
on
the
next
page,
paragraph
(c),
measures
the
monthly
allowance
that
he
would
receive.
i
dwell
on
this
particular
section
because
you
will
note
that
the
words,
“put
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
compensation”
were
used
in
speaking
of
displaced
employees.
they
were
never
used
in
speaking
of
employees
laid
off
or
other
kinds
of
employees.
i
think
this
bears
upon
the
question,
well,
why
didn't
they
use
the
language,
“put
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
their
compensation”
in
later
statutory
enactments?
they'd
had
a
special
position
both
here
and
in
the
railroad
act
of
1933.
section
7,
at
the
bottom
of
page
143,
provides
what
was
there
called
a
coordination
allowance
for
employees
that
were
laid
off
as
the
result
of
any
consolidation
of
railroad
facilities.
there
are
two
things
about
it
which
are
important
to
later
development.
in
the
first
place,
the
allowance
was
set
at
only
60%
of
the
employee's
average
compensation
during
prior
periods.
and
in
the
second
place,
as
shown
over
at
the
top
of
page
144,
the
period
for
which
you
might
receive
the
payment
was
fairly
short,
at
least
in
terms
of
later
standards.
for
example,
in
order
to
get
a
four-year
protection,
you
had
to
have
at
least
10
years
seniority.
whereas,
we
know
under
the
statute
now,
four
years
seniority
would
give
you
the
four-year
protection.
then
the
other
provisions
of
the
washington
agreement,
which
i
needn't
stress
at
the
same
detail,
cover
the
points
which
we
find
later
in
the
order
in
this
case.
section
8,
at
the
top
of
147,
guarantees
all
fringe
benefits,
the
free
travel,
transportation
and
other
kinds
of
allowances,
and
the
like.
at
page
148,
you
will
find
the
reimbursement
from
moving
expenses
and
then
over
on
page
--
bottom
of
148
and
over
on
149
and
150,
is
the
machinery
protecting
employees
in
the
event
of
the
sale
of
their
homes.
here
then,
we
had
a
negotiated
agreement
covering
the
bulk
of
the
industry
which
sought
to
provide
partial
financial
protection,
but
which
did
not
imply
any
kind
of
a
job
freeze.
then
we
come
to
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
which
wrote
into
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
language
involved
in
this
case.
at
that
time,
the
congress
had
before
it,
two
distinct
examples,
the
emergency
railroad
act
of
1933,
which
had
the
language
of
a
guarantee
of
employment
and
also
a
guarantee
against
displacement
and
the
negotiated
financial
protection
of
the
washington
agreement.
there's
no
need
to
go
through
the
early
stages
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
legislation
of
1940.
it's
enough
to
say
that
the
committee
of
six,
appointed
by
president
roosevelt,
which
framed
the
1940
legislation,
the
house
and
senate
committees
and
the
senate
itself,
all
clearly
went
down
the
road
of
financial
protection
based
on
the
washington
agreement.
the
bills
which
they
drafted
included
language
very
similar
to
the
first
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
including
the
language
about
requiring
the
commission
to
set
up
a
fair
and
equitable
arrangement
for
the
protection
of
employees.
and
it
was
in
that
form
that
the
bill
passed
the
senate
also
came
to
the
house
floor.
on
the
house
floor,
there's
not
the
slightest
doubt
that
the
house
originally
switched
signals
and
wrote
into
the
bill,
a
guarantee
of
continued
employment,
despite
merger.
this
was
the
harrington
amendment.
it
put
a
proviso
after
the
authority
to
the
commission
to
prescribe
a
fair
and
equitable
arrangement,
which
stipulated
that
no
such
transaction
shall
be
approved
by
the
commission
if
such
transaction
will
result
in
unemployment
or
displacement,
not
that
it's
both
unemployment
and
displacement
and
not
just
one
of
the
carrier
or
carriers
or
in
the
impairment
of
the
existing
employment
rights
of
said
employees.
there
were
some
congressmen
who
asserted
that
this
language
was
never
intended
to
guarantee
employees
against
layoffs
as
the
result
of
a
merger.
but
as
i
said
before,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
language
is
perfectly
clear
and
that
if
this
language
had
become
part
of
the
law,
we
would
all
say
that
it
was
plain
on
the
face
of
it
that
a
guarantee
of
continued
employment
was
the
result.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
in
the
report
--
legislative
report
made
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
during
the
conference
committee
discussion,
yes.
there
were,
i
should
point
out,
two
sources
of
support
for
the
harrington
amendment.
one
was
made
up
of
those
who
were
looking
for
a
job
freeze.
the
other
sources
of
support
were
those
who
said
to
put
it
very
colloquially,
“we
don't
know
whether
we
can
trust
these
administrative
agencies.”
we
have
one
notion
of
what
is
a
fair
and
equitable
arrangement,
but
quite
often,
we
find
that
the
agencies
have
different
notions.
and
therefore,
they
wished
to
write
into
the
said
statutes
some
requirement,
some
rule
that
would
bind
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
as
it's
been
said,
the
harrington
amendment
went
into
the
bill.
the
bill
went
to
conference.
and
when
the
bill
--
when
the
conference
committee
reported,
it
resolved
this
conflict
between
the
senate
bill
which
had
no
harrington
amendment
and
the
house
bill
which
did,
by
leaving
out
of
the
legislation
all
provisions
about
mergers
and
consolidations
and
therefore,
they
took
no
position
upon
it
at
all.
when
the
report
came
before
the
house,
representative
wadsworth
offered
a
motion
to
recommit
to
the
conference
committee
with
instructions.
and
the
language
of
that
motion
it
seems
to
me
to
be
highly
important
here,
because
it
is
radically
different
from
the
harrington
amendment
and
as
we
see
it,
this
is
really
the
critical
step
in
the
legislative
history
and
therefore,
i'll
impose
on
the
court
to
call
attention
to
it
in
some
detail.
the
motion
moved
to
recommit
the
bill
with
instructions
to
the
managers
on
the
part
of
the
house.
there
were
three
instructions.
the
first,
that
the
managers
on
the
part
of
the
house
insist
on
the
inclusion
in
the
report
of
the
committee
of
conference,
the
provision
adopted
by
the
house
is
the
--
known
as
the
jones
amendment,
which
reads
as
follows,
“and
then
it
set
out
in
so
many
words
the
jones
amendment
which
bar
upon
water
carriers
and
the
rate
set
by
them
jointly
with
the
rail
carriers.”
then
the
second
instruction
again
instructed
the
managers
on
the
part
of
the
house
to
insist
upon
the
exact
language
of
the
wadsworth
amendment,
just
as
it
has
been
offered
before.
it
set
out
the
wadsworth
amendment.
then
we
come
to
a
very
different
instruction,
the
third
one.
that
the
managers
on
the
part
of
the
house
insist
on
the
inclusion
in
the
report
of
the
committee
of
conference,
the
--
the
provisions
adopted
by
the
house
relating
to
consolidations
and
combinations
of
carriers,
but
modify
it
so
that
the
sentence
in
section
8
which
contains
the
provision
known
as
the
harrington
amendment
read
as
follows,
and
then
came
the
language
which
is
quoted
on
page
33
of
our
brief
in
the
full
text.
i
won't
take
time
to
read
it
all,
but
i
would
emphasize
that
the
second
sentence
which
provided
with
--
within
an
order
including
approving
a
consolidation.
“the
commission
shall
include
terms
and
conditions,
including
that
such
transactions
will
not
result
in
employees
of
said
carrier
or
carriers
being
in
any
worse
position
with
respect
to
their
employment.”
now
obviously,
this
was
not
just
a
technical
change
in
the
phraseology
aimed
at
simplification
or
brevity.
the
harrington
language
had
forbidden
the
approval
of
a
consolidation
if
there
would
be
any
unemployment
or
any
displacement
and
both
those
references
to
unemployment
and
to
displacement
were
left
out
of
the
wadsworth
instruction.
the
appellants
suggest
in
their
brief
that
the
language
in
the
wadsworth
instruction
was
to
come
from
the
emergency
railroad
transportation
act
of
1933,
but
that
the
language
is
about
--
the
language
about
unemployment
and
displacement
were
telescoped
and
left
out
apparently,
in
the
interest
of
revenue.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
significant
comparison
is
just
the
opposite.
that
there
was
an
example
with
a
job
freeze
or
an
employment
freeze
and
that
the
wadsworth
instruction
or
following
perhaps
the
very
urging
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
report
that
justice
whittaker
mentioned,
did
not
include
those
words.
we
submit
that
one
of
two
conclusions
necessarily
follows
from
this
change
from
the
language
of
the
harrington
amendment
to
the
wadsworth
instruction.
one
conclusion
would
be
that
the
harrington
amendment
was
modified
for
the
specific
purpose
of
avoiding
any
mandatory
job
freeze,
which
would
make
railroad
consolidations
impracticable
and
returning
to
the
idea
of
financial
protection
which
has
been
the
mainline
of
development
up
to
that
point
and
the
washington
agreement,
the
committee
reports,
the
vote
of
the
senate
and
i
may
add,
the
support
of
all
the
railway
labor
organizations,
except
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
the
other
possibility
that
we
could
conceive
of
is
that
the
wadsworth
instruction
was
compromised
which
left
the
issue
at
large,
that
we
will
leave
it
to
the
commission
to
determine
how
to
keep
employees
from
being
worse
off,
allow
them
to
choose
within
their
discretion.
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
either
conclusion
would
require
sustaining
the
order
below.
because
i
have
said
the
commission
addressed
itself
to
the
question,
assuming
we
have
discretion,
we
find
that
this
is
the
method
of
protection
which
would
be
most
practicable
and
most
to
the
public
interest
and
that
finding
has
not
been
challenged.
after
the
debate
on
the
--
oh,
well
i
should
say
something
one
thing
more
about
the
debate
on
the
wadsworth
instruction.
there
were
three
times
during
the
debate
that
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
language
of
the
wadsworth
instruction
was
not
the
language
of
the
harrington
amendment.
this
was
acknowledged
indeed,
in
one
of
those
instances
by
mr.
harrington
and
it
was
stated
on
two
separate
occasions
by
congressman
wolverton,
who
seemed
to
be
carrying
the
labor
--
laboring
oar,
in
the
debate
on
the
labor
provisions.
congressman
harrington
did
himself
speak
of
the
wadsworth
instruction
as
if
it
would
freeze
employment.
i
don't
think
there
could
be
any
denying
that.
he
said
a
great
many
things
in
the
course
of
the
speech,
but
there
are
one
or
two
sentences
which
do
speak
as
if
he
thought
that
the
motion
to
recommit
would
involve
a
job
freeze.
as
to
that,
we
simply
say
that
in
the
light
of
the
general
course
of
events,
the
great
significance
of
the
change
in
language
and
the
other
comments
made
during
the
debate
that
the
statement
by
congressman
harrington
is
not
entitled
to
any
weight
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
--
he
spoke
of
it
as
modified
language
or
a
modified
provision.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
didn't
--
that's
all
he
said.
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
he
had
said
anything
more.
there
wasn't
any
discussion
on
the
floor
by
anyone,
about
the
significance
of
the
change.
the
only
thing
any
of
us
can
draw
from
the
subsequent
legislative
history
is
that
people
made
passing
comments
about
the
effect
of
the
instruction.
one
was
congressman
harrington
who
did
say
that
it
would
result
in
a
job
freeze.
he
didn't
use
the
words,
but
he
plainly
conveyed
the
idea.
mr.
archibald
cox
nobody
--
nobody
denied
that,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
wasn't
commented
on
in
--
in
anyway.
similarly,
congressman
lea,
several
times,
attacked
the
instruction
in
language
which
spoke
of
its
compelling
a
railroad
to
pay
a
wage
for
life
to
an
employee
for
whom
it
had
no
job
or
an
employee
who
had
been
discharged
and
nobody
quarreled
with
him.
i
--
there
--
there
just
wasn't
any
debate
upon
this
point.
that
seems
quite
possible
to
me
after
all.
those
who
were
supporting
the
instruction
were
naturally
interested
in
the
--
making
the
most
claims
for
it,
in
terms
of
employee
protection.
those
who
were
opposing
the
motion
to
recommit
were
naturally
content
to
have
it
look
as
bad
as
it
could
because
they
didn't
want
anything
in
the
bill
on
this
subject.
now,
there
were
some
general
statements
on
the
floor
to
the
effect
that
the
wadsworth
instruction
would
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
harrington
amendment.
but
i
submit
that
those
are
rather
ambiguous
because
we
don't
know
just
what
is
meant
by
the
purposes.
but
today,
in
the
light
of
this
case,
the
issue
of
employment
freeze
or
no
employment
freeze
looks
very
significant.
but
if
you
go
back
and
think
in
terms
of
the
context
of
that
debate
in
1940,
the
great
issue
was
whether
you
were
going
to
protect
the
employees
at
all.
there
had
been
nothing
in
the
conference
report
that
gave
any
protection
and
the
wadsworth
instruction,
interpreted
as
we
suggest
must
be
interpreted,
really
was
a
very
great
advance.
it
not
only
put
back
in
the
language
about
the
fair
and
equitable
arrangement.
it
narrowed
the
commission's
discretion
by
setting
a
floor
below
which
it
could
not
go.
it
went
beyond
the
washington
agreement
by
guaranteeing
not
60%
of
your
previous
wage,
but
100%
and
it
gave
much
greater
protection
in
point
of
time.
so
that
anyone
there
who
is
thinking
generally
of
the
protection
of
employees
could
say,
and
honestly
say,
that
this
language
carries
out
the
purpose
of
protecting
employees.
it
carries
out
the
great
purpose
of
the
harrington
amendment.
so
i
see
no
inconsistency
with
those
general
statements
in
our
interpretation
of
the
wadsworth
amendment.
the
motion
to
recommit
passed
and
the
bill
went
back
to
conference.
the
conference
committee
reported
out
what
is
of
course
now,
section
5
(2)
(f),
but
made
certain
changes.
the
statement
of
the
house
managers
contains
an
exposition
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
which
seems
to
me
to
be
--
seems
to
us
to
be
highly
significant
and
again,
worth
considering
in
some
detail.
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
pages
60
and
61
of
the
appellants'
brief,
because
what
they
print
and
what
they
omit
seems
to
me
to
be
the
key
to
the
essential
fallacy
in
their
argument
based
on
the
legislative
history.
the
statement
of
the
house
managers
began
with
the
paragraph
at
the
bottom
of
page
60.
the
house
amendment
included
a
proviso,
the
harrington
amendment
prohibiting
approval
of
any
transaction
which
would
result
in
unemployment
or
displacement
of
employees,
or
in
the
impairment
of
their
employment
rights.
there
was
no
similar
provision
in
the
senate
bill.
then
the
statement
of
the
house
managers,
the
so-called
committee
report,
goes
on
to
explain
that
in
lieu
of
this
provision,
the
conference
substitute
included
section
5
(2)
(f).
it
quoted
that
in
full
and
then
came
two
paragraphs,
which
i
find
very
significant,
which
the
appellants
have
omitted.
“the
substitute
proposal
for
the
harrington
amendment
before
it
began,
as
recommended
by
the
--
to
the
conferees
by
the
instructions
of
the
house
provided
in
substance.”
i'm
emphasizing
the,
“as
recommended
by
the
instructions
of
the
house.”
they
knew
the
difference
between
the
harrington
amendment
and
the
instructions
of
the
house
and
they
quoted
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
reading
from
the
conference
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
report.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
from
a
paragraph
explaining
5
(2)
(f)
as
a
whole.
the
paragraph
read,
“that
substitute
proposal
for
the
harrington
amendment
as
recommended
to
the
conferees
by
the
instruction
of
the
house,
provided
in
substance
that
in
the
case
of
consolidations
of
the
unifications,”
then
i
stopped
reading
because
it
summarizes
the
first
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
and
the
point
which
i
wanted
to
emphasize
was
that
the
house
managers
observed
the
distinction
between
the
harrington
amendment
and
the
instruction.
then
the
statement
went
on,
“the
instruction
of
the
house
also
made
the
provisions
of
the
amendment
applicable
to
the
case
where
other
means
of
transportation
was
substituted
for
rail
transportation
and
they
explained
that
they
had
left
this
out
as
impracticable.”
then
we
go
on
and
we
find
the
part
of
the
report
bearing
directly
on
this
case.
“the
conference
agreement
on
the
harrington
amendment
includes
the
provision
of
the
instruction,”
again
not
the
contrast
between
the
two,
“which
provides
that
the
order
of
approval
shall
include
terms
and
conditions
providing
the
transaction
will
not
result
in
employees
being
in
a
worse
position
as
a
result
--
with
respect
to
their
employment.
the
conference
agreement
qualifies
this
provision.”
in
other
words,
the
provision
of
the
instruction,
not
any
provision
of
the
harrington
amendment
and
that
explains
i
think
why
it
is
in
the
--
in
a
later
sentence
in
this
passage.
the
house
managers
refer
to
the
time
limitation
as
something
that
cuts
off
or
terminates
the
period
for
which
benefits
will
require
--
be
required
to
be
paid.
they
know
that
benefits
were
what
were
required
and
not
an
employment
freeze.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
the
luncheon
recess,
i
had
traced
the
history
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
through
to
the
second
conference
report
and
had
drawn
attention
to
the
provisions
in
the
second
conference
report
that
recognized
the
sharp
distinction
between
the
harrington
amendment
and
the
wadsworth
instruction
which
showed,
in
our
view
that
the
provisions
of
the
conscie
--
conference
report
were
based
upon
the
instruction
and
which
also
spoke
of
a
time
limit
imposed
upon
the
benefits
required
to
be
paid,
language
which
clearly
speaks
in
terms
of
financial
protection
and
not
of
a
freeze
on
employment.
that
same
tone
was
carried
through
the
debate
on
the
con
--
second
conference
report
in
the
house
where
you
find
congressman
lea,
who
is
one
of
the
house
managers
and
chairman
of
the
house
committee,
several
times
speaking
of
the
time
limits
that
had
been
imposed
on
the
benefits,
so
that
the
benefits
wouldn't
run
for
more
than
four
years,
similar
expression,
all
of
which
are
consistent
with
our
view.
and,
it
seems
to
me,
utterly
inconsistent
with
mr.
mahoney's
view
of
the
statute.
the
appellants'
do
point
to
certain
language
in
the
debate
on
the
second
conference
report
which
contains
references
to
protection
against
unemployment
and
protection
against
sudden
dismissal.
in
our
view,
that's
an
ambiguous
phrase.
clearly,
it
could
literally
mean
protection
against
dismissal.
but,
it
is
also
familiar
to
use
the
expression
"protection
against
something"
as
insurance
against
--
protection
against
its
financial
consequence.
for
example,
we
often
speak
of
protection
against
windstorm,
hail,
fire,
not
even
the
insurance
companies
can
keep
those
acts
of
god
from
occurring.
and
by
the
protection,
we
mean
protection
against
the
financial
consequence.
most
point
involved,
the
washington
agreement
of
1936
was
known
as
the
washington
job
protection
agreement,
and
it
granted
the
kind
of
financial
protection
created
here,
no
guarantee
of
featherbedding,
also,
it
was
improved
very
greatly
by
this
amendment.
there
are
two
other
passages
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
nothing,
except
that
passing
reference
to
the
harrington
amendment,
which
i
think
is
--
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
simply
distinguished
the
harrington
amendment
from
the
wadsworth
amendment
and
the
jones
amendment,
so
it
is
not
to
be
taken
to
mean
literally
all
the
provisions
in
the
exact
meaning
of
the
harrington
amendment.
that's
really
about
the
only
thing
there
is
in
the
senate.
there
is
no
debate
on
this
provision
in
the
senate.
in
the
house,
there
were
two
--
two
passages
that
deal
explicitly
with
this
problem,
as
they're
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
at
pages
40
and
41.
mr.
vorys
of
ohio
asked
about
the
four-year
rule
and
asked
if
it
would
have
the
effect
of
delaying
a
consolidation,
and
mr.
lea
replied,
"no,
the
rule
does
not
delay
consolidation.
it
means
from
the
effective
date
of
the
order
of
the
commission,
the
benefits
are
available
for
four
years.
the
order
determines
the
date
and
the
protective
benefits
run
four
years
from
that
date."
mr.
vorys,
"this
would
be
whether
or
not
they
are
still
employed."
"yes."
both
the
question
and
the
answer
obviously
assume
that
the
employees
would
not
be
still
employed.
then,
over
on
the
next
page,
we've
set
forth
a
quotation
from
the
closing
statement
of
congressman
halleck,
who
was
also
a
conferee,
and
which
seems
to
me
to
say
in
a
few
words
the
gist
--
the
thrust,
i
should
say,
of
this
whole
legislative
history.
he
stated
that
the
new
provision
follows
the
principle
of
the
so-called
washington
agreement.
that
was
a
contract
entered
into
by
the
carriers
with
their
employees
to
fix
the
rights
of
those
employees
whose
employment
terminated
upon
consolidation.
and
to
summarize
what
i
think
is
the
result
of
the
entire
legislative
history,
from
the
negotiation
of
the
washington
agreement,
to
which
only
the
trainmen
dissent,
the
whole
momentum
of
the
development
was
in
terms
of
protective
benefits,
expanding
them,
enlarging
the
time,
there
was
a
brief
fling
with
the
notion
of
going
back
to
an
employment
freeze
in
the
original
harrington
agreement
but
then
that,
as
the
contrast
in
the
language
of
the
--
with
the
wadsworth
instruction
showed,
was
turned
back
on
and
everything
following
is
consistent
with
the
notion
of
financial
benefit.
now,
this
explains,
i
think,
the
reason
that
when
the
bill
was
passed,
the
journals
of
the
railway
brotherhoods
described
it
in
terms
of
gaining
financial
benefits.
and,
this
was
true
with
the
journals
of
such
an
organization
as
the
locomotive
firemen
and
enginemen,
which
had
been
one
of
the
organizations
that
sponsored
the
exact
language
of
the
wadsworth
instruction.
indeed,
sent
it
to
all
the
members
of
congress
in
a
letter,
along
with
the
five
other
transportation
brotherhoods
and
they,
in
their
journal,
again
described
it
as
calling
for
financial
protection.
in
view
of
the
words
of
the
legislative
history,
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
meaning
of
the
second
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f).
but,
if
there
were
doubt,
surely,
it
would
be
put
to
rest
by
the
consistent
interpretation
for
20
years
through
active
administration
of
the
statute
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
that's
now
--
not
only
was
a
contemporaneous
interpretation
arrived
at
very
shortly
after
the
passage
of
the
legislation.
it
was
an
interpretation
reported
to
congress
as
early
as
the
annual
report
for
1941
and
it's
an
interpretation
that
has
been
followed
consistently
since
then,
and
until
this
case
was
understood
and
approved
by
everyone
concerned
not
simply
the
commission
with
the
great
bulk
of
the
carriers
and
also
the
railway
labor
organizations,
including
the
railway
labor
executives,
the
appellants
in
this
case.
the
matter
first
came
to
the
attention
of
the
committee
--
commission
in
a
consolidation
involving
the
fort
worth
railroad.
at
that
time,
the
railroad
took
the
position
that
the
second
sentence
of
5
(2)
(f),
and
therefore
the
whole
section,
imported
a
job
freeze.
the
railway
labor
executives'
filed
a
brief
in
answer
to
this
contention.
we've
quoted
a
large
passage,
not
all
of
which
i
will
read,
on
pages
57,
58
and
59
of
our
brief
saying
that
they
didn't
agree
with
this
construction.
the
conclusion
they
came
to
is
on
page
58
of
our
brief,
right
about
the
middle.
we
conclude
that
a
comprehensive
system
of
dismissal
and
displacement
allowances,
plus,
reasonable
assurance
of
the
continuance
of
certain
minor
employee
rights
and
privileges
for
a
period
of
four
years
will
place
the
employee
in
no
worse
position
with
respect
to
his
employment
than
that
which
he
occupied
before
in
this
case
at
the
least.
so,
it's
perfectly
in
a
contested
case,
perfectly
clear
cut
interpretation
of
the
statute.
in
that
particular
case,
the
commission
was
not
required
to
rule
because
he
disapproved
the
merger
and
therefore,
it
didn't
have
to
go
on
to
the
conditions
protecting
the
employee.
commissioner
joseph
b.
eastman,
however,
very
plainly
expressed
the
view
that
what
was
contemplated
was
not
featherbedding
but
a
guarantee
of
financial
protection
for
the
four-year
period.
and
then,
the
commission,
in
a
subsequent
case
involving
the
texas-new
orleans
railroad
on
that
same
year,
did
consider
the
problem
at
length
and
did
rule
that
financial
benefits
were
what
were
intended.
now,
i
would
emphasize
that
this
has
not
been
simply
in
action
on
the
commission's
part,
as
in
the
handcar
case
that
was
mentioned
earlier
during
the
argument.
this
was
a
--
this
is
a
problem
where
the
commission
and
the
railway
labor
organizations
and
the
railroads
have
been
actively
concerned
with
this
over
a
considerable
period
of
time.
there
were
10
cases
that
are
reported
dealing
with
what
conditions
should
be
laid
down
between
the
passage
of
the
statute
and
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
railway
labor
executives'
case
about
1950.
there
were
20
reported
cases
since
then.
this
isn't
simply
a
problem
that
was
forgotten
all
about.
it
wasn't
litigated
in
these
precise
terms.
i
don't
want
to
overstate
the
case.
but,
what
was
a
worse
position
was
something
people
were
discussing
all
the
time.
they
were
developing
proper
conditions
and
laying
them
down,
as
was
finally
done
in
this
case.
so
that,
we
think
the
constant
administrative
interpretation
should
be
enough
to
put
any
possible
doubt
to
rest
as
to
the
correctness
of
the
decision
by
the
court
below.
i
agreed
to
give
mr.
mcafee
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
far
this
--
the
first
place
it
got
into
the
law,
if
i
understand
you
correctly
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
doesn't
appear
prior
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
--
i
haven't
been
able
to
trace
this
any
farther
back
than
a
letter
which
was
written
--
within
a
story
of
the
president
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
relating
the
history
of
the
transportation
act
of
1940
in
this
respect.
this
was
in
their
--
one
of
their
publication.
and,
in
it,
he
encloses
the
letter
dated
may
1,
1940,
which
was
during
the
house's
consideration
of
the
first
conference
report,
and
there
is
set
forth
the
exact
text
of
the
wadsworth
instruction.
i
can't
trace
the
language
any
farther
back
than
that.
i
just
don't
find
it
in
--
the
phrase
"worse
position
with
respect
to
their
compensation"
had
been
used
in
the
washington
agreement
in
speaking
as
a
word
of
art
--
mr.
archibald
cox
of
displaced
employees,
but
the
whole
expression,
mr.
justice
black,
i've
not
been
able
to
get
back
of
that
letter.
and,
the
formal
introduction
of
the
language
was
in
the
wadsworth
instruction.
