chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
happens
--
what
happens
if
there
hadn't
been
a
merger
to
these
employees,
if
the
--
if
the
railroad
laid
them
off?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
get
more
than
the
mere
salary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
would
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pay
for
any
valid
--
for
any
valid
reason,
it
might
not
have
been
decline
in
--
in
business.
it
might
be
some
efficiency
operation
or
something
of
--
of
that
kind.
what
would
happen
if
the
man
went
off
the
payroll?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
if
he's
under
the
old
system,
if
he
--
if
he
was
entitled
to
no
relief
and
under
this
system
he's
entitled
to
his
pay
for
four
years,
he
isn't
getting
the
worse
of
it,
is
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
where
are
you
going
to
draw
the
line?
you
say
you
--
you
don't
claim
it's
not
absolute
freeze,
but
you
do
claim
it's
something
else.
where
is
--
where
is
the
line
beyond
which
they
can't
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
there's
a
job
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
leaves
me
to
the
conclusion
that
you
do
say
there
is
an
absolute
freeze.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
or
it
isn't,
it
seems
to
me.
that's
why
i
asked
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
try
to
draw
the
line
for
me
as
to
where
--
where
it
would
come.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
under
no
circumstances
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
under
no
circumstances,
can
the
railroad
change
it
for
four
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i'd
like
--
i
just
like
to
pursue
it,
just
one
question
farther
an,
that
is
this.
do
you
claim
that
the
freeze
goes
to
such
an
extent
that
if
the
government
or
if
the
railroad
rather,
is
of
the
opinion
that
it
has
no
job
for
--
for
one
of
these
employees,
that
it
can
lay
him
off
and
pay
him
for
the
four
years
that
he's
laid
off?
do
you
say
that
it's
denied
the
right
to
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
can't
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
--
that's
where
i
want
to
do.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
it
might
go.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
that
a
moment
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
--
would
you
mind
playing
to
--
to
the
--
the
record
where
we
could
find
that
legislative
history
where
they
specifically
said
that
attrition
was
the
only
basis
on
which
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
mr.
harrington
talking
to
his
own
amendment
or
to
someone
else's
amendment
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
there
to
indicate
why,
if
it
means
the
same
thing,
they
changed
the
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
did
they
say
they
would
be
--
would
be
transferred
or
they
might
be
transferred?
chief
justice
earl
warren
104?
chief
justice
earl
warren
112.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago
that
mr.
harrington
conceded
that
--
that
this
provision
would
be
different
from
his
original
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
mind
starting
that
again
please,
that
--
what
you're
reading,
your
quotation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand
what
you're
reading
from.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mcafee.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mahoney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
wondering,
mr.
mahoney,
about
the
--
the
attitude
of
the
house
oregon
of
these
various
unions
is
concerned,
and
i
notice
the
quotation
from
your
own
house
oregon
entitled
four
years
full
pay.
does
the
law
provide
that
any
employee
who
has
been
in
the
service
of
a
railroad
four
years
or
more
and
loses
his
job
because
of
a
merger
or
coordination
must
be
paid
his
full
wages
for
four
years?
if
he
has
been
a
railroad
employee
less
than
four
years,
he
must
be
paid
his
full
wages
for
a
period
as
long
as
his
previous
service.
no
such
protection
and
compensation
have
ever
been
guaranteed
by
law
to
the
employees
of
any
other
industry
and
the
railroad
workers
secured
these
unprecedented
benefits
through
the
brotherhood
of
maintenance
of
way
employes
in
a
cooperative
movement
with
the
other
standard
railway
labor
organizations.
now,
i
understand
from
the
briefs
that
that
same
attitude
has
been
taken
by
--
by
all
the
various
brotherhoods.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
