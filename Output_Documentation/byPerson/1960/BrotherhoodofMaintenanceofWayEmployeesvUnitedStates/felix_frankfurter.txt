you
do
--
you
do
--
your
position
is
that
they
must
be
kept
in
employment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
there's
maneuvering
ground
as
to
what
employment
is
equivalent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
must
be
kept
in
employment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
be
taken
cared
of
physically,
financially.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
meant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
from
your
--
but
from
your
point
of
view,
that's
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
you're
saying
is
there
must
be
an
employment
freeze
or
not
this
particular
job
freeze
for
instance
and
from
your
point
of
view,
it's
compulsory
as
it
were
by
way
of
giving
the
privilege
of
allowing
the
merger.
you're
saying
that
the
right
to
merge
is
something
that
has
to
be
approved
of
by
the
icc
and
the
condition
to
that
--
for
that
--
for
that
approval
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
may
be
withheld
--
which
might've
been
withheld
or
forbidden
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
as
a
reward
or
the
compensation
or
a
sweetening
for
what
they're
asking
and
getting.
there
is
an
employment
freeze
whether
there
are
jobs
and
--
according
to
efficient
management
of
railroad
or
not.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
agree
on
this
as
your
position,
it's
a
job
freeze,
but
not
the
job
freeze?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
you've
said,
except
not
doing
--
as
brief
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
must
have
a
job,
therefore
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
job,
but
not
the
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
result
of
your
position,
it
may
be
incumbent
upon
the
icc
not
to
certify,
not
to
allow
the
merger
because
thereby,
the
people
according
to
your
view
of
the
reading
of
the
statute
of
congress,
according
to
your
view,
people
must
be
retained
redundantly,
redundant
employment.
if
they
--
if
they
do
what
you
say
under
certain
circumstances
and
therefore,
the
commission
reads
--
reaches
the
economic
conclusion
--
transportation
conclusion,
we
won't
allow
them
that
you
know
for
those
reasons,
may
be
highly
desirable
in
the
public
interest.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
that
what
it
gets
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
otherwise,
it
gets
to
the
chief
justice's
and
justice
brennan's
position,
namely,
if
that
do
it,
have
to
--
have
a
lot
of
featherbedding
employments.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
every
case
of
merger,
as
a
practical
thing,
it
works
out
that
they
--
that
they
would,
if
they
wanted
to
retain
the
men
in
--
in
employment,
not
on
--
but
not
in
the
employment.
are
you
saying
that?
that
it's
a
practical
thing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
if
they
really
wanted
to
keep
people
in
effective
employment,
they
could
do
so
and
yet
have
a
merger?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
--
is
that
a
legal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
can
we
operate
on
that
--
on
that
assumption
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
maybe,
that's
a
different
question.
if
the
statute
is
clear,
you
don't
need
any
other
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
statute
is
--
isn't
clear,
then
--
then
to
say
that's
a
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
freezing
in
employment
because
you
said,
practically,
it
doesn't
operate
that
way
in
--
in
the
affairs
of
life,
which
certainly
isn't
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
mahoney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
dealing
with
--
excuse
me,
dealing
with
the
chief
justice's
problem,
you
referred
to
the
third
clause
of
the
5
(2)
(f).
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
third
sentence
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
third
sentence.
would
you
agree
that
the
third
sentence
in
no
wise
legally
--
legally
qualifies
limits
or
modifies
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
help
you
likewise,
with
our
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
the
discussion
of
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
ask
whether
if
such
a
laid
off
employee
obtained
another
--
a
different
job
in
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
got
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
be
stupid.
i
don't
understand
why
four
years
--
why
four
years
makes
a
difference
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
whenever
--
oh,
i
see,
that's--
it--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
formal
merger.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
the
--
just
the
document
that
you
read.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
already,
so
that
the
merger
is
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
unconstant
--
unconstant,
if
the
construction
contended
for
by
the
appellant
should
be
required
to
be
the
law,
should
be
required
to
be
the
meaning
of
the
law,
it
will
affect
--
it
may
well-affect
the
i.c.c.
in
not
allowing
you
to
go
through
that
paper
performance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
this
specific
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
the
point
of
view
of
effectuating
the
statute
is
practically
--
is
in
effect.i'm
not
saying
just
determines
the
meaning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
is
a
potential
veto
on
mergers,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you're
going
to
stick
to
what
senator
wheeler
said,
that
isn't
quite
accurate,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
--
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
what
senator
wheeler
said,
what
he
said
isn't
accurate,
is
it?
unless,
you
say
that
the
instructions
--
that
the
manager
specifically
not
telling
them
--
specifically
not
saying
you
should
hold
out
for
the
harrington
amendment,
it's
not
the
harrington
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
i
agree
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
could
understand
that.
that
simply
means
we
all
use
shorthand
language
when
we
talk.
