mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
i,
of
course,
do
not
plan
to
cover
in
the
few
minutes
remaining
to
the
appellees
the
points
which
have
been
so
ably
presented
by
the
solicitor
general.
what
i
would
like
to
treat
of
is
what
will
be
the
practical
effects
of
what
the
appellants
are
asking
for
in
this
court.
and
let
me
say
right
away,
i'll
state
my
conclusion
first.
we
say
it's
not
possibly
the
job
freeze,
but
it
is
a
job
freeze.
and,
we
go
further
from
that
and
we
say
no
matter
what
version
of
the
interpretation
we
take,
and
it's
buried
that
that
will
inevitably
result
in
the
merger
not
being
consummated,
other
than
in
its
technical
sense
for
four
years.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
can,
demonstrate
that
to
you.
let
me
say,
before
i
get
into
my
analysis
of
the
various
versions
of
what
the
appellants
are
asking
for
here,
that
they
are
various
versions,
they
are
conflicting
versions,
but
each
of
them,
i
say,
ends
up
with
a
job
freeze
in
what
the
merger
actually
not
being
compensated
for
four
years.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
well,
the
second
--
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
that
--
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
there's
a
formal
merger
as
we
have
now.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
your
honor,
we
have
formally
merged
these
two
corporations
together.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
that
is
correct
and
we
have
one
management,
run
one-and-a
half
management
running
two
separate
and
distinct
railroads
today.
it's
a
terrible
situation.
and,
we
say
that
would
exist
for
four
years
under
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
what
the
appellants
were
asking
for
here.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
there's
no
reason
to
do
so
and
we
wouldn't
ask
for
the
right,
your
honor.
except,
right
now,
my
client
is
in
the
middle.
we
are
--
we
are
already
technically
--
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
it
would
--
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
there's
no
question
about
that.
it
would
effectively
defeat
the
policy
of
congress.
there's
no
question
about
it.
now,
if
i
may
demonstrate
what
i
mean,
your
honor.
in
the
brief
--
the
appellant's
brief,
the
central
theme
or
a
central
theme
in
that
brief
is
that
the
commission
was
guilty
of
error
and
that
it
did
not
prevent
adverse
effects
upon
employees.
that's
the
way
the
--
their
questions
are
posed.
they
say
that
the
commission
was
in
error
in
that
it
only
provided
something
after
the
effect.
they
say
that
the
commission
should
prevent
the
adverse
effect.
and,
on
page
37,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
30
--
37
of
the
appellant's
brief,
the
heading
to
point
four
is
legislative
history
compels
the
conclusion
that
employees
must
not
be
adversely
affected
in
their
employment
for
four
years.
now,
the
--
there's
no
dispute
about
what
is
adversely
affected,
what
that
means.
and
if
you
take
that
theory
of
what
is
required
by
the
second
sentence,
we
can't
deploy
these
jobs,
we
can't
transfer
employees,
we
can't
displace
employees,
we
can't
do
anything.
we
can't
move
their
work
because
that
would
affect
them.
so,
admittedly,
if
that
construction
is
adopted
by
the
court,
we
can't
do
anything.
now,
here
today
and
then
back
in
his
brief,
the
appellant
stated,
"well,
we
could
transfer
employees
to
comparable
jobs
at
comparable
pay."
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
we
have
only
one
precedent.
we
really
have
a
one
--
they
can
be
displaced,
your
honor.
they
aren't
protected
by
the
new
orleans
commissions
[laughter]
and
they
weren't
covered
by
the
stay
your
honors.
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
i'm
sorry?
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
i'm
afraid
they're
not
--
they
have
not
yet
been
included
under
the
protection.
i
think
they
should
be,
your
honor,
especially
the
lawyers.[laughter]
mr.
ralph
l.
mcafee
but,
in
any
event,
here
today
and
in
his
brief,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
appellant
says
you
can
transfer
employees
to
comparable
work
and
comparable
pay.
it's
been
a
phrased
differently
to
equivalent
work
and
equivalent
pay
in
some
other
places.
but,
just
think
about
that
a
moment
and
it
--
it
fits
in
with
a
question
which
was
put
by
the
court
below.
what
would
be
the
effect
of
that
privilege?
let's
apply
it
to
a
specific
situation.
we
want
to
move
our
accounting
department,
the
lackawanna
accounting
department
from
scranton
to
cleveland
and
merge
it
there
with
the
erie
accounting
department
so
we
have
only
the
one
accounting
department.
well,
now,
under
this
admission
made
that
we
can
transfer
people,
transfer
them
to
comparable
jobs,
i
suppose
we
could
require
them
to
move
out
there,
the
people
from
scranton,
but
the
important
thing
is
this.
once
we
get
there,
we
can't
merge
those
operations.
we
would
still
have
two
separate
and
distinct
accounting
departments
out
there,
one
for
the
lackawanna
and
one
for
the
erie,
because
these
people
don't
have
any
right
to
take
any
position
in
the
--
the
seniority
roster
of
the
erie.
and,
one
of
the
basic
contention,
one
of
the
basic
ground
rules,
which
the
appellants
ever
had
to
adhere
to
throughout
and
which
they
expressed
to
you
when
they
applied
to
you
for
a
stay
was
this,
that
you
may
not
merge
the
seniority
rosters,
you
may
not
merge
the
workforces.
and,
if
you
can't
do
that,
you
can't
do
anything.
that
is
the
central
theme
of
this.
they
won't
no
bumping
and
you
can't
merge
seniority
rosters
without
bumping.
so,
under
their
contention
or
their
admission
that
we
can
transfer
employees
from
one
place
to
another
and
they
are
required
to
go
wouldn't
help
us
at
all.
and,
i
might
say
in
that
connection,
here
for
the
first
time
today
in
these
proceedings
had
the
appellant
said
that
an
employee
is
required
to
move
or
else
he
loses
his
protection.
now,
just
--
just
think
about
that
a
minute
because,
under
the
new
orleans
conditions,
which
these
people
are
already
entitled
to
under
the
commission's
order,
they
can't
be
compelled
to
do
that.
they
can
only
be
compelled
to
move
to
a
job
which
their
seniority
entitles
them
to,
within
their
seniority
district
or
their
seniority
point.
other
than
that,
they
can
say,
"i
don't
want
to
go.
i
want
to
be
paid."
well,
now,
here
for
the
first
time
today,
the
appellants
have
said,
under
what
they
propose,
the
employees
don't
have
that
right
and
that
protection.
they
must
move
from
scranton
to
cleveland.
well,
frankly,
i
accept
that
and
it
doesn't
affect
my
conclusion
at
all.
we
still
can't
merge
the
functions
when
we
get
them
out
to
cleveland,
but
i
do
respectfully
submit
that
i
doubt
if
the
brotherhoods,
we
have
to
deal
with,
the
local
unions.
we
have
over
100
contracts
outstanding.
those
people
are
not
going
to
agree
with
that
no
matter
what
that
rlea
says,
but
i
--
it
doesn't,
as
i
say,
affect
my
conclusion
that
this
proposal
of
the
appellants
will
just
result
in
no
merger
for
four
years
because
there
would
be
absolutely
no
point
in
us
moving
that
operation
out
to
cleveland
if
we
couldn't
merge
it
out
there.
no
reason
at
all
to
go
through
all
that
expense.
and,
further,
if
--
there's
another
statement
made
in
the
brief
that
employees
are
entitled
to
follow
their
work.
now,
that
presents
a
slightly
different
problem.
if
that
is
really
the
position
that
they
are
entitled
to
follow
their
work,
when
we
move
our
accounting
office
out
to
cleveland,
some
of
the
employees
would
go
and
obviously,
some
of
them
wouldn't.
i
think
an
estimate
would
be,
probably
75%
would
go.
but,
we'd
have
a
slightly
different
situation
under
that
concept
of
what
this
second
sentence
means
because
we
would
have
a
separate
organization
out
there
but
we
wouldn't
have
enough
employees
to
man
it
and,
so,
we
would
have
to
go
out
and
hire
additional
people
to
come
in
and
fill
in
the
lackawanna
bookkeeping
department
out
there
so
it
could
still
operate.
it
still
has
a
job
to
do.
an
attrition
has
nothing
to
do
with
this,
your
honors.
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
it.
once
we
have
those
two
--
two
operations
out
there,
what
good
would
attrition
do
us?
assume
that
some
key
employ
--
some
employee
in
the
erie
bookkeeping
department
died.
we
can't
go
over
and
--
well,
we
--
under
this
theory,
we
could
go
over
and
find
a
fellow
with
a
comparable
job
in
this
lackawanna
bookkeeping
department
and,
at
least
according
to
these
people,
apparently,
that's
attrition.
you
can
move
them
across.
well,
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that.
in
the
first
place,
he
wouldn't
have
a
right
to
do
that.
that
would
violate
the
rights
of
all
the
people
in
that
other
seniority
roster.
and
in
the
second
place,
we'd
have
to
hire
someone
else
to
do
the
work
over
to
lackawanna
because
we
don't
have
unnecessary,
unneeded
employees
there.
so,
someone
would
have
to
come
up
from
the
bottom.
there'd
be
a
bumping
upwards
and
--
and
we
wouldn't
lose
any
jobs
whatsoever.
now,
those
are
the
proposals
made
by
the
union
here,
made
by
the
appellants
here.
and,
even
if
--
if
they
say,
"oh,
well,
those
are
all
technicalities
and
really,
we're
going
to
permit
you
to
merge
or
get
these
ground
rules
we
were
talking
about.
we're
going
to
permit
you
to
merge
when
you
get
out
to
cleveland,
forget
about
that."
the
actual
fact
is,
and
they
can't
dispute
it,
at
the
time
we
merge
those
two
functions,
we
have
more
employees
than
we
have
jobs.
at
that
point,
i
don't
care
about
attrition.
maybe
attrition
will
take
care
of
them
later
but,
at
that
point,
we
have
more
employees
than
we
have
jobs.
now,
what
do
we
do
with
them?
do
they
stay
back
in
scranton?
do
we
have
to
keep
the
building
back
there
for
them,
keep
facilities
for
them,
and
we'd
come
in,
punch
the
timecard?
do
we
have
to
worry
about
the
safety
of
these
employees?
what
do
we
do
with
them?
do
we
have
them
stay
at
home?
how
--
how
are
they
any
better
off
doing
that
than
they
would
be
under
the
new
orleans
conditions?
because,
under
the
new
orleans
conditions,
they
will
be
paid
for
four
years
and,
if
they
want
to
go
look
for
other
work,
they
could
do
it.
they
can
take
a
lump
sum
settlement
and
go
out
and
look
for
other
work.
i
think
it'd
be
a
terrible
thing
to
require
these
fellow
employees
to
come
in
to
do
nothing.
and,
i
could
think
of
nothing
worse
on
the
morale
--
no
worse
effect
on
the
morale
of
the
fellow
employees
who
are
actually
working.
now,
mr.
mahoney
has
said
here
today
that,
well,
they
could
share
the
work.
but,
if
the
court
--
your
honors,
if
we
ever
did
that,
we'd
end
up
with
eroded
work
rules
and
we'd
have
more
jobs.
if
you
start
splitting
work,
you're
really
stuck
with
additional
jobs.
so,
that's
no
solution
either.
now,
i
would
like
to
comment
upon
two
things.
first,
the
appellants
have
referred
to
an
agreement
between
the
north
of
--
norfolk
&
western
railroad
and
the
virginian
and
the
brotherhoods
as
stating
what
they're
really
asking
for
here.
well,
that
doesn't
bear
the
slightest
resemblance
to
what
they
are
asking
for
here.
in
that
case,
the
basic
contract
provided
that
the
railroad
had
the
right
merge
the
seniority
rosters,
something
we
cannot
do
here.
and,
secondly,
in
merging
the
seniority
rosters,
they
were
entitled
to
just
disregard
the
people
on
the
furlough
list.
and
third,
they
were
entitled
to
transfer
those
people
anywhere
in
the
system
and
if
they
didn't
go,
they
lost
all
their
rights.
so,
that
is
completely
dissimilar
from
what
they
are
asking
for
here.
now,
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
this
novel
point,
this
novel
interpretation
of
the
second
sentence
was
raised
for
the
time
after
the
record
was
closed
below.
no
proof
was
put
in
whatsoever
by
us
or
by
the
brotherhood.
nothing
was
put
in
the
record.
this
theory
was
first
raised
before
the
hearing
examiner.
now,
it
would
be
grossly
unfair
to
us,
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
i.c.c.
and
to
the
examiner
to
send
this
back
for
further
proceedings.
our
railroad
is
in
bad
shape.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
it's
admitted.
the
other
day,
we
filed
an
application
for
a
guarantee
on
a
$15
million
loan.
we're
losing
money
all
the
time.
this
court
granted
a
stay
which
is
a
job
freeze,
a
complete
job
freeze.
we
haven't
been
able
to
do
anything
under
it.
so,
i
respectfully
request
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
