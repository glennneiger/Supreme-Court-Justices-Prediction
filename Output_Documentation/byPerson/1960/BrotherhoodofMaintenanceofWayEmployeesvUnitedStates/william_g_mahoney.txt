mr.
william
g.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
your
honors
on
an
appeal
of
the
brotherhood
of
maintenance
of
way
employees
and
the
railway
labor
executives'
association
from
a
judgment
and
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
dismissing
a
complaint
which
those
two
organizations
had
brought
in
that
court,
for
the
following
reasons
which
is
expressed
at
page
12
of
our
brief
on
the
merits.
the
railroad
labor
force
is
now
confronted
with
the
threat
through
the
use
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
for
the
utilization
of
--
for
merger
to
that
statute
which
congress
thought
would
materialize
20
years
ago,
when
it
enacted
that
statute.
the
time
has
now
come
therefore,
for
the
employees
to
be
afforded
the
protection
intended
by
congress
to
take
effect
when
this
threat
arose.
the
complaint
request
to
the
court
to
set
aside,
at
least
in
part,
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
issued
under
the
provisions
of
section
5
(2),
approving
the
erie-lackawanna
railroad
merger,
because
that
order
does
not
observe
the
specific
requirement
contained
in
subparagraph
(f)
of
section
5
(2),
which
it
must
contain
and,
that
is
that
there
be
terms
and
conditions
imposed
which
provide
that
for
varying
periods
of
up
to
four
years
from
the
date
of
the
approval
of
the
merger
that
the
transaction
will
not
result
in
employees
of
a
carrier
or
carriers
by
railroad
affected
by
such
order,
being
placed
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
their
employment.
the
commission's
order
does
contain
certain
conditions
relative
to
employees
who
are
affected,
but
these
conditions
not
only
fail
to
protect
an
employee
from
being
placed
in
a
--
placed
in
a
worsened
employment
situation,
but
require
such
effects
to
occur
before
the
conditions
become
operative.
these
conditions
are
known
as
the
new
orleans
conditions
and
provide
a
constituted
formula
of
compensatory
protection
for
those
who
were
deprived
of
employment,
displaced,
have
to
move
and
so
forth,
as
a
result
of
a
merger.
but
these
effects
have
to
occur
before
these
conditions
become
operative
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
type
of
protection
does
not
meet
the
mandate
of
the
statute.
the
issue,
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court,
is
whether
the
phrase,
“worse
position
with
respect
to
employment”
really
is
intended
to
protect
the
employment
of
the
man
or
only
certain
elements
of
that
employment
and
not
the
employment
itself,
in
other
words,
whether
he's
to
be
given
money
in
lieu
of
employment.
it
is
our
position
that
this
phrase
means
that
in
this
merger
cases,
the
employees
must
be
given
--
provided
continuing
employment
in
a
comparable
job,
at
a
comparable
wage
and
if
the
wage
is
less
than
that
which
he
previously
earned,
then
it
must
be
made
up
by
what
is
called
in
the
railroad
industry,
a
displacement
allowance.
and
there
is
nothing
astonishing
or
new
or
unprecedented
about
congress
protecting
employment,
providing
employment
protection.
it
did
so
in
1933
in
the
emergency
railroad
transportation
act
of
that
year.
it
did
so
in
1943,
in
the
communications
act
of
that
year.
and
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
these
measures
of
1933
and
1943
were
emergency
measures,
very
limited
in
their
application
and
therefore,
cannot
be
compared
with
section
5
(2).
because
in
1933,
or
excuse
me,
in
1943,
the
communications
industry
was
in
no
worse
financial
situation
than
the
railroad
industry
was
in
1933,
when
the
emergency
railroad
transportation
act
was
passed.
the
1943
act
was
passed
to
save
the
communications
--
industry
by
permitting
merger.
and
there
were
only
two
--
virtually
only
two
companies
to
which
that
statute
applied.
it
was
the
--
postal
telegraph
and
western
union.
they
comprised
just
about
the
communications
industry.
but
now,
we
have
a
situation
which
is
applicable
to
practically
the
entire
industry
also.
almost
all
the
railroads
of
the
united
states
are
attempting
to
merge
and
this
is
precisely
what
congress
had
in
mind,
as
we
hope
to
show
in
passing
this
statute
and
further,
this
is
not
an
unlimited
protection
which
these
men
are
given.
it
is
limited
in
time
to
four
years,
as
congress
isn't
required
to
go
beyond.
now,
excuse
me,
the
commission
is
not
required
to
go
beyond
four
years
in
applying
this
protection.
and
it
cannot
be
said,
we
submit
that
this
protection
would
harm
the
erie-lackawanna
railroad.
for
they
say
in
their
evidence
that
only
862
men
would
be
deprived
of
employment
as
a
result
of
this
merger
and
these
862
men
would
be
deprived
of
employment
only
because
they
would
refuse
to
transfer
to
available
jobs.
and
under
this
type
of
protection,
it
is
our
position
that
they
would
have
to
transfer
to
those
available
jobs
or
receive
no
protection.
the
appellants
do
not
contend
and
have
never
contended
that
the
protection
required
by
the
second
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
is
an
absolute,
strict,
inflexible
job
freeze.
the
government
described
the
appellants'
position
at
page
19
of
its
brief
in
this
language,
“the
essence
of
appellants'
position
is
that
no
employee
of
a
consolidated
railroad
system
should
be
adversely
affected
in
any
respects
for
a
period
of
four
years
or
less
time
if
his
previous
employment
is
less
from
the
effective
date
of
the
commission's
order.”
and
at
page
17
of
the
brief,
the
government
states,
“appellants
claim
that
the
general
language
in
which
the
second
section
of
the
sentence
is
couched
has
a
single,
specific,
inflexible
meaning
that
an
absolute
job
freeze
must
be
imposed
in
every
case
in
which
the
commission
approves
a
merger.”
now,
the
appellants
have
never
contended
that
the
term,
“no
worse
position
with
respect
to
employment”
meant
such
an
absolute,
strict,
job
freeze.
we
have
never
can
explain
than
employees
could
not
be
adversely
affected
in
any
respect
under
this
type
of
protection.
for
example,
a
man
whose
job
is
transferred
is
adversely
affected
if
he
has
to
pick
up
his
family
and
move.
that's
adverse
effect.
that's
real
adverse
effect,
but
he
might
not
be
placed
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
his
employment
as
a
result
of
that.
it's
conceivable,
in
some
instances,
it
might
be
better
employment.
he
might
be
promoted.
also
a
man
must
take
--
who
must
take
another
job,
a
different
job,
may
be
adversely
affected,
but
that
doesn't
mean
necessarily,
he's
placed
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
his
employment.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
first
of
all
that
these
conditions
do
not
protect
the
employee
in
all
aspects
of
his
employment
relationship
except
employment.
that
is
the
conditions
that
were
imposed
by
the
commission
do
not
protect
a
man
in
every
aspect
of
his
employment.
to
the
contrary,
it
causes
great
harm
and
it
doesn't
even
provide
complete
financial
protection.
he
doesn't
get
paid
for
all
the
fringe
benefits
for
instance
that
he
loses.
he
doesn't
get
paid,
if
he
is
required
to
move
more
than
once
as
a
result
of
this
merger.
the
--
he
starts
a
chain
of
bumping
to
seniority,
exercising
seniority
rights
which
affects
many
more
than
just
the
man
who
was
affected
on
--
in
the
particular
job
which
is
abolished
or
transferred.
now,
all
of
these
things
happen
and
as
a
result
of
that
adverse
affect,
he
is
placed
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
his
employment
and
we
feel
that
the
minimum
that
is
required
by
that
phrase,
that
term
is
that
he
be
continued
in
employment
in
a
comparable
job
at
a
comparable
way.
and
that
is
what
is
not
done
under
the
present
law
or
under
the
--
excuse
me,
under
the
present
conditions
that
the
commission
imposed.
now
that
is
the
basic
requirement
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
in
the
second
sentence
and
that
is
the
only
position
which
we
have
taken
and
this
position,
we
think,
this
type
of
protection
allows
great
flexibility
to
the
commission
in
prescribing
terms
and
conditions
while
retaining
at
the
same
time,
the
employment
protection
concept
which
is
unchanged
from
the
original
language
of
the
harrington
amendment.
for
example,
in
the
original
harrington
amendment,
they
prohibited
displacement
of
employees.
an
employee
couldn't
be
given
another
job.
they
froze
him
in
the
job
and
that
isn't
done
we
believe,
here.
as
i
say
this
is
the
same
position
we
took
before
the
commission
and
before
the
district
court
at
page
181
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
judge
o'sullivan
asked
me
during
that
argument
and
said,
“those
employees
shall
have
what
you
call,
their
job's
frozen
for
not
less
than
a
period
of
time
that
they
were
employed
prior
to
the
effective
date,
is
that
your
position?”
i
answered,
“yes,
your
honor,”
perhaps
it
is
semantics,
but
i
really
don't
believe
it
can
be
called
job
freeze.
they
do
not
freeze
the
job.
they
freeze
the
employment
situation.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
employee
could
not
be
dismissed.
the
jobs
can
be
changed.
the
employees
may
have
to
move.
they
may
get
other
jobs,
but
they
have
to
be
comparable
jobs
at
comparable
wages.
the
jobs
are
not
necessarily
frozen.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
precisely,
your
honor.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
of
course,
they
--
they
have
to
receive
their
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
the
same
compensation,
but
in
not
--
in
lieu
of
employment,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that's
correct.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
was
no
merger
and
if
the
commission
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
there
was
no
statute
under
which
the
commission
was
acting.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
there
was
a
decline
in
business
or
something,
of
that
nature.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
then
they
would
--
then
they
would
receive
nothing.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
for
example,
when
the
--
when
the
railroads
dieselized,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
--
a
great
reduction
in
force.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
railroad
industry
is
--
is
at
the
lowest
point
now
in
employment,
number
of
employment
force
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
and
since
before
1900
and
that
was
just
stated
in
congress
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
but
if
that
happens
and
technical
--
technological
advances
and
so
forth
takes
place,
there
is
no
protection
under
the
law.
congress
provided
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
the
protection
when
the
railroads
took
advantage
of
something
that
congress
provided
them
to
do
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
through
the
statute.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
oh,
well,
where
the
--
where
the
congress
acts,
that
is
true.
and
either
under
the
old
system
as
you
say,
your
honor,
even
in
the
--
the
railroads
that
were
parties
to
the
washington
agreement,
which
was
a
voluntary
agreement
between
the
railroads
and
the
unions
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
they
provided
for
compensatory
benefits.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
what
these
men
have
is
a
bad
thing,
certainly
not.
that
they're
--
they're
able
to
get
some
money
for
their
jobs,
but
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
they
can't
go
beyond
this
line,
as
i
see
it.
the
man
must
be
continued
in
employment
in
a
comparable
job.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
according
to
their
testimony,
there
would
be
a
job.
they
said
they're
only
862
people
who
are
going
to
be
deprived
of
employment.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
it
is
if
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
it's
the
sense
that
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
as
i
look
at
this
term
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
the
way
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
if
the
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
as
--
as
i
look
at
this
characterization
of
absolute
inflexible
job
freeze,
it
means
to
me
that
the
employee
is
frozen
in
his
job
and
that
the
job
is
frozen
at
the
place
where
it
is
now.
now
that
--
and
that's
what
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that's
what
that
term
connotes.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
now
that
--
that's
what
the
job
freeze
as
--
as
the
appellees
characterize
it
means
to
me.
that
is
not
what
i
mean.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
mean
that
--
well,
i
say
that
they
can
--
the
man
has
to
be
retained
in
active
employment.
they
can
give
him
a
different
job.
they
can
transfer
him
to
a
different
place.
there
--
a
number
of
things
they
can
do
in
that
--
just
in
that
respect,
however
as
long
as
he
is
retained
in
employment
with
the
railroad
and
their
jobs
are
reduced
or
eliminated
as
natural
attrition
takes
place.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no,
i
--
i
--
no
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
in
the
sense
that
the
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
in
the
sense
that
the
employee
is
retained
in
employment,
in
some
employment
at
some
place.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
it's
his
--
it's
an
employee
freeze,
i
would
rather
call
it
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
if
we
get
to
freeze
something.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
think
it's
--
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
railroad
can
merge
only
so
fast
as
the
attrition
lets
it
merge,
that
is
as
jobs
are
reduced
through
attrition.
that
is
specifically
stated
in
the
legislative
history
as
the
purpose
of
this
thing.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that
--
that
is
possible.
i'm
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
say
it
is
possible,
but
the
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
the
only
practical
answer
i
have
of
that,
your
honor,
is
this.
recently,
two
years
ago,
the
representatives
of
the
employees
of
the
norfolk
&
western
and
virginia
railroads
and
the
management
for
those
two
railroads,
entered
into
an
agreement
prior
to
commission
approval
of
the
merger
which
was
intended,
which
provided
the
precise
type
of
protection
which
we
seek
here
and
in
addition,
had
no
time
limit
upon
it.
every
man
on
both
railroads
must
be
retained
in
the
employment
of
the
railroads
and
the
job
would
be
reduced
as
attrition
--
actual
attrition
permitted
as
reduction
and
that
is
now
been
in
process
for
--
for
two
years.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
it
is
a
voluntary
agreement.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
that
it
would
work
out,
you
say,
your
honor?
is
that
what
you
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no,
i
don't
believe
that
particular
case
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no,
but
i
think
that
the
statute
itself
is
clear
as
to
what
was
intended.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
precisely.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no,
sir.
but
i
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
there
is
not
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
because
there
maybe
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
--
there
maybe
at
times,
situations
where
there
would
be
that
problem
presented.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
and
i
--
i
feel
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
third
sentence
to
section
5
(2)
(f),
working
on
agreements
between
carriers
and
their
employees
where
this
would
work
in
an
equity
or
hardship,
or
be
unreasonable
that
that
type
of
thing
can
be
worked
out.
but
if
there
is
no
agreement,
it
is
our
position
that
the
merger
can
only
take
place
and
congress
intended
it
this
way
that
the
merger
can
only
take
place,
insofar
as
job
reductions
are
concerned,
as
fast
as
attrition
permits
it
and
i
say
congress
was
very
clear
about
it.
now,
there
is
a
great
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
excuse
me.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
the
appellants'
brief
on
the
merits,
at
page
55
of
that
brief,
in
the
bottom
of
the
page,
mr.
harrington,
who
is
the
author
of
this
provision
of
law
and
the
author
of
it
--
of
the
original
provision
said
this
was
regard
to
the
term,
“worse
position
with
respect
to
employment.”
that
this
provision
was
designed
to
accomplish
the
purposes
intended
to
be
accomplished
by
the
harrington
amendment,
which
was
the
original
harrington
amendment
and
the
original
harrington
amendment
said,
“there
shall
be
no
unemployment.
there
shall
be
no
displacement
of
employees.
there
shall
be
no
impairment
of
existing
employment
rights.”
that
was
what
the
original
language
said.
when
the
language
was
changed,
it
said,
“no
worse
position
with
respect
to
employment.”
mr.
harrington
here
said
this
means
the
same
thing.
the
labor
provision
says
“with
this
provision,
the
younger
men
will
be
spared
that
fate,”
that
is
eliminated
from
railroad
service
and
job
eliminations
will
come
gradually
from
the
other
end
of
the
seniority
list
as
deaths,
resignations
and
retirements
occur.
mr.
warren
--
representative
warren
who
spoke
in
support
of
this
statute,
his
comment
is
on
page
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
he
was
there
talking
to
the
wadsworth
--
with
respect
to
the
wadsworth
motion
to
recommit,
which
so
far
as
we
know
from
--
from
the
legislative
history
may
have,
what
must've
been
written
by
mr.
harrington
and
those
are
his
adherence,
because
he
spoke
in
favor
of
it.
he
said
it
was
the
same
as
the
original
act.
nobody
challenged
that
it
wasn't
the
same,
that
as
those
who
wanted
employment
protection.
representative
warren
as
i
say
says
that
this
--
this
means
precisely
what
the
former
language
meant
because
275
members
of
the
house
had
requested
the
conferees
during
the
first
conference
when
they
heard
that
they
might
strike
that
amendment.
they
said
they
petitioned
him
to
keep
it
in
and
the
--
and
they
not
only
struck
that
amendment
but
they
struck
all
--
all
provisions
about
consolidation.
mr.
warren
said,
if
you
--
those
of
you
who
signed
that
petition
meant
what
you
said,
then
the
only
way
to
give
expression
to
it
is
to
vote
to
recommit.
if
the
house
wishes
to
write
its
bill
and
wishes
its
will
to
be
upheld
rather
than
accept
a
new
measure
written
by
12
conferees
where
its
will
was
ignored,
then
you
will
vote
to
recommit
this
conference
report
with
instructions
to
place
back
in
it
what
you,
by
overwhelming
majorities,
had
previously
voted
for
and
at
that
point,
the
congressional
record
notes
that
these
words
were
greeted
with
applause.
mr.
thomas
got
up
and
said
he
was
for
continuous
employment
and
for
that
reason,
he
was
voting
for
the
motion
to
recommit,
because
it
had
the
harrington
amendment
in
it.
now,
these
are
the
words.
these
are
the
only
words
which
will
relate
directly
to
the
phrase,
“worse
position
with
respect
to
employment.”
now,
if
all
parties
agree
that
if
harrington's
amendment
had
not
been
modified
in
the
wadsworth
motion
to
recommit
and
we
now
had
the
law
saying
no
unemployment,
no
displacement
and
no
deprivation
or
impairment
of
employment
rights,
there's
no
question
of
what
that
would
mean.
then,
the
men
would
have
to
stay
and
they
could
not
even
be
changed
from
one
job
to
another.
they
couldn't
be
displaced.
but,
they
changed
those
words
and
he
said
“worse
position
with
respect
to
employment.”
so
what
does
that
mean?
it
means
what
i
would
think
mr.
harrison
or
excuse
me,
mr.
harrington
and
the
other
members
of
the
house
who
were
the
proponents
of
that
type
of
legislation,
intended
it
to
mean
and
said
it
meant.
and
in
this,
we
follow
the
admonition
of
this
court
that
is
not
--
that
it
is
not
to
the
proponents
of
legislation,
but
to
the
proponents
that
we
go
to
determine
what
legislation
means
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no.
there
--
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
nothing
in
there
to
explain
why
they
changed
the
words.
mr.
harrington
tells
us
they
did
not
change
the
effects.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
he
tells
us
we
changed
--
he
did
change
the
words.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
oh,
yes,
your
honor
as
to
what
the
word
means.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
no,
i
don't
believe
it's
ambiguous.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
--
i
think
it
means
it
--
it
places
a
more
flexible
meaning
on
the
employment
protection.
the
original
harrington
amendment,
no
question
about
it,
said
no
displacement
of
employees.
now,
that
doesn't
say
that
here
in
the
modified
language.
so
perhaps,
they
can
be
displaced
as
long
as
their
wages
are
--
are
kept
up.
they
--
that
is,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
when
the
--
because
of
the
two
opposing
factions
in
the
house,
those
who
wanted
employment
protection
and
those
who
wanted
only
compensation
protection,
where
you
--
where
you're
faced
with
those
two
things
and
you
had
to
compromise
somewhere
and
the
first
compromise
came,
i
believe
and
this
isn't
completely
evident
from
the
legislative
history,
the
first
compromise
came
when
the
--
they
changed
the
words
and
you
go
from
a
strict
job
freeze,
no
displacement,
to
a
more
flexible
employment
protection
which
gives
the
commission
some
area
in
which
to
work,
some
type
of
conditions
to
impose
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
at
the
--
as
your
honor
knows,
shortly
after
the
--
shortly
after
this
bill
was
passed
and
this
law
was
enacted,
there
were
--
and
several
of
the
unions
explained
to
their
members
what
they
had
accomplished
in
the
last
session
of
congress.
each
of
these
unions
was
the
union
who
had
opposed
employment
protection
because
they
feared
it
would
kill
the
bill.
they
had
--
had
advanced
and
proposed
--
compensation
protection
as
found
in
the
washington
agreement,
which
they
were
all
used
to
and
which
they
said
they
wanted
to
put
in
a
law.
they
told
their
employees,
or
excuse
me,
they
told
their
members
that
we
have
--
achieved
a
very
considerable
victory
and
they
described
that
victory
in
the
terms
of
the
washington
agreement,
a
couple
of
them
did.
some
of
them,
it's
--
it's
very
vague
and
really
couldn't
say
it
supports
that.
one
of
them
called
it
a
dismissal
wage
protection,
actually
said
that.
mr.
harrington,
in
talking
to
mr.
lea
on
the
floor
of
the
house
said,
“you
are
wrong
when
you
called
this
dismissal
wage
protection.”
dismissals
come
--
there
are
no
dismissals.
dismissals
--
the
jobs
are
eliminated
as
men
retire
and
die
and
resign
and
so
forth,
but
a
man
can
be
wrong
about
how
the
law
applies
to
him,
obviously.
the
--
there
were
a
couple
of
excerpts
from
briefs
which
were
written
in
1941,
i
believe,
by
members
of
the
firm
of
which
now,
i
am
a
member,
in
which
they
spoke
of
--
of
compensation,
getting
down
to
wages
as
a
matter
of
compensation.
in
the
case
that
was
cited,
i
think
it
was
the
fort
worth
&
the
d.c.
case
of
this
court.
there,
the
adverse
effect
was
going
to
take
place
after
four
years.
no
adverse
effect
was
going
to
take
place
within
the
four-year
period.
this
was
very
early
in
the
game
insofar
as
employment
protection
or
employee
protection
was
concerned,
nobody
had
evolved
a
specific
type
of
protection
for
these
people.
the
railroad
wanted
--
said
this
means
employment
protection,
but
it's
limited
to
four
years.
and
after
four
years,
we
have
to
give
them
nothing.
that's
all
we
have
to
give
them,
nothing
after
four
years.
we're
happy
to
keep
them
all
just
exactly
where
they
are
for
four
years
and
that's
all
this
means.
the
rlea,
at
that
time,
had
to
take
a
position
that
these
people
must
be
protected
and
compensation
protection
certainly
applies
to
them
after
four
years
and
the
few
who
may
be
affected
during
that
four
years,
should
also
get
compensation
protection.
that
was
no
time
that
in
--
bring
this
issue
in,
bring
the
new
orleans
issue
in
and
all
the
rest
because
obviously,
that
--
in
that
type
of
situation
it
just
didn't
permit
it.
it
couldn't
achieve
anything
where
you
have
also
so
many
important
issues
involved.
now,
the
--
i
think
there
was
one
oral
argument
that
was
referred
to
and
that
the
same
problem
was
there
involved
on
whether
the
icc
should
get
involved
in
--
in
seniority
problem.
and
a
member
again
of
the
law
firm
of
which
i'm
a
member
said,
“no,
they
should.”
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
devolved
to
a
question
of
wages,
because
the
men
who
were
there
being
affected
were
not
even
employees
of
the
carriers
which
were
involved
in
the
transaction.
that
was
the
pere
marquette
case.
it
was
a
third
carrier.
so
they
should
get
protection
as
in
--
in
both
of
those
cases.
in
the
first
case
is
(inaudible)
case,
the
commission
disclaimed
any
or
rather,
they
denied
the
--
the
application
and
therefore,
made
no
construction
themselves.
now,
in
1950,
when
the
new
orleans
case
came
up,
that
again,
involved
what
happens
after
four
years,
not
what
happens
during
the
four-year
period
and
there,
it
had
been
10
years
then,
since
section
5
(2)
(f)
had
been
passed
and
it
was
quite
obvious
from
the
way
the
commission
reacted
as
to
the
type
of
protection
and
the
--
the
time
limit
on
the
protection
and
the
way
the
district
court
reacted
as
to
the
time
limit
on
the
protection,
that
it
would've
been
legal
suicide
to
raise
this
issue
at
that
time,
as
to
what
--
what
type
of
protection
was
limited
and
was
required
by
the
--
by
the
first
in
the
--
during
the
first
four
years.
there
was
no
reason
for
it.
there
wasn't
an
issue
and
it
was
foolish
to
raise
it.
the
--
now,
those
are
the
only
positions,
if
you
can
call
them
that
that
have
been
taken
on
the
statute
and
the
commission
that
is
meted
by
everyone
that
the
commission
has
never
decided
this
issue.
it
has
never
been
raised.
there
is
no
dispute
on
that
point.
the
issue
is
--
has
never
been
raised
and
it
has
never
been
decided
and
in
that
respect,
that
it
isn't
--
it
is
in
the
same
category
as
the
statements
of
--
rather,
the
same
category
of
the
rule
which
was
announced
recently
by
this
court
in
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railway
company
against
jackson,
where
for
60
years,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
considered
maintenance
of
way
vehicles
not
subject
to
the
safety
of
plants
act.
and
they
said
that
this
was
a
consistent
administrative
interpretation
which
was
--
persuasive
evidence
that
congress
never
intended
them
to
be
covered
by
that
act.
this
court,
however,
held
that
while
it
is
true
that
long
administrative
practice
is
entitled
to
wait,
there
has
been
no
express
administrative
determination
of
the
problem
and
we
believe
that
petitioner
over
speaks
in
elevating
negative
action
to
positive
administrative
decision.
in
our
view,
the
failure
of
the
commission
to
act
is
not
a
binding
administrative
interpretation
that
congress
did
not
intend
these
guards
to
come
within
the
purview
of
these
acts.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
do.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
if
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
if
there
is
no
agreement,
then
--
then
your
problem
is
there.
that
is
true.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
but
your
honor
as
i
say,
when
you
look
at
the
plain
language,
the
plain
language
says
“employment.”
employment
in
that
--
in
this
statute
is
not
used
in
any
--
as
any
term
of
art.
it
just
says
employment.
there
is
nothing
in
the
--
in
5
(2)
(f),
in
section
5
or
in
the
entire
interstate
commerce
act,
which
would
indicate
that
this
particular
phrase
is
used
in
any
other
sense
than
its
normal,
natural,
accepted
meaning
of
“state
of
being
employed,”
as
webster
defines
it.
in
addition,
the
term
“worse
position
with
respect
to
compensation”
was
clearly
before
the
congress.
it
had
been
used
in
the
transportation
act
of
1933.
it
had
been
used
in
the
washington
agreement.
and
had
congress
just
meant
compensation
and
fringe
benefits
as
the
government
and
the
other
appellees
--
the
appellees
contend
then
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
just
to
say
“worse
position
with
respect
to
compensation.”
they
would've
achieved
their
purpose.
now,
in
answer
to
that
in
the
court
below,
the
government
claimed
that
you
couldn't
use
“worse
position
with
respect
to
compensation”,
because
that
entire
clause
was
a
--
was
a
term
of
art
and
it
implied,
as
a
term
of
art,
continued
employment.
and
we
say
that
if
“worse
position
with
respect
to
compensation”
implies
continued
employment,
then
most
certainly,
“worse
position
with
respect
to
employment”
requires
continued
employment.
now,
another
point
in
the
briefs,
the
counsel
for
the
appellees
have
stated
that
the
words,
“affected”
in
section
5
(2)
are
very
significant.
that
5
(2)
(f)
was
passed
to
protect
affected
employees
and
how
in
the
world
can
you
protect
an
affected
employee
if
he's
not
affected
in
the
first
place
which
he
wouldn't
be,
they
say,
if
there
was
a
strict
job
freeze.
we
say
he
is
affected.
he's
affected
by
transfers
and
by
giving
different
jobs,
but
aside
from
that,
it's
significant
in
the
way
that
congress
used
that
term,
“affected”
in
relation
to
employees.
in
the
first
sentence,
which
is
clearly
applicable
only
to
compensation
protection,
protection
which
comes
after
the
effect,
they
say
that
the
commission
shall
provide
this
protection
to
railroad
employees
affected,
but
in
the
second
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f),
it's
entirely
different.
they
say
that
they
shall
protect
employees
of
carriers
affected
and
keep
them
in
no
worse
position
with
respect
to
employment.
and
we
believe
that
this
--
the
significant
difference
in
the
use
of
these
words
in
the
two
sentences
is
important
and
significant.
thirdly,
if
we
look
to
the
emergency
transportation
act,
we
find
that
congress
said,
“no
employee
shall
be
deprived
of
employment
under
this
act.
no
employee
shall
be
placed
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
compensation
for
employment,
as
a
result
of
this
act.”
so,
when
they
wanted
perhaps,
to
change
mr.
harrington's
language
and
get
rid
of
the
displacement
problem
and
permit
transfers
and
so
forth,
they
went
back
as
we
must
assume
they
did,
to
the
emergency
transportation
act
and
took
the
two
phrases
and
combined
the
two
phrases
into
one,
thereby
accomplishing
all
that
was
accomplished
by
that
act.
now,
these
appellees
are
confronted
with
the
language
of
mr.
harrington,
of
mr.
warren
and
of
mr.
thomas.
and
in
order
to
show
that
“worse
position
with
respect
to
employment”
does
not
contain
the
concept
of
continued
employment,
they
must
explain
away
their
language.
now,
the
eerie-lackawanna
explains
it
away
in
this
manner.
they
are
driven
of
the
astounding
contention
that
you
can't
take
what
these
men
say
at
their
face
value
because
it
was
an
election
year
and
they
were
probably
just
talking
for
their
constituents.
the
government
says,
“you
can't
take
it
at
its
face
value
either,
because
although
harrington
and
they
quote
harrington,
they
quote
the
statement
that
i
read
where
harrington
said,
“job
eliminations
will
come
from
natural
attrition
as
deaths
and
retirements,
etcetera,
occur,”
but
you
can't
believe
harrington,
because
although
harrington
told
you
what
the
effect
of
this
language
was,
he
didn't
tell
you
why
he
changed
it.
we
submit
that
he
didn't
have
to
tell
us
why
he
changed
it.
it's
obvious
that
it
was
changed
and
it's
obvious
that
he
said
precisely
that.
now,
they
don't
comment,
incidentally
on
the
words
of
warren
or
thomas.
i
don't
believe
they
can.
i
would
like
to
discuss
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
the
--
the
two
cases
upon
which
relied
this
--
rely
the
two
decisions
of
this
court.
before
i
get
ahead
of
myself,
i'd
like
to
say
this,
the
three
times
congress
had
voted
on
employment
protection,
the
house
act,
they
voted
on
the
original
harrington
amendment.
they
had
sent
this
petition,
275
of
them,
to
the
conferees
and
they
had
voted
on
the
wadsworth
motion
to
recommit,
which
they
have
been
told
and
which
they
thought
meant
employment
protection.
now,
when
mr.
lea
came
out
of
that
second
conference
committee,
mr.
lea,
one
of
the
most
outspoken
opponents
of
this
legislation
from
the
beginning
in
either
its
original
or
modified
form,
when
he
came
out
of
that
house
or
that
committee,
he
knew
the
temper
of
this
house
of
representatives
and
he
knew
and
that
if
they
had
removed
employment
protection,
they
might
well
kill
the
bill.
confronted
with
this
house
of
representatives
that
had
voted
three
times
for
employment
protection,
he
did
not
say
that
that
protection
had
been
removed
and
if
he
thought
it
had
been
removed,
he
was
under
a
compelling
and
pressing
moral
obligation
to
say
so
and
he
didn't
say
so.
now,
to
the
cases
--
the
opinions
upon
which
we
rely,
first,
there
is
the
opinion
in
this
court's
decision
in
railway
labor
executives'
association
against
united
states,
339
u.s.
142
and
second,
this
court's
opinion
in
the
order
of
railroad
telegraphers
against
the
chicago
&
northwestern
railroad
company,
362
u.s.
330.
in
the
first
case,
the
rlea
case,
the
court
was
concerned
with
the
type
of
protection
to
be
afforded
after
the
four-year
period
referred
to
in
the
second
sentence,
had
expired.
the
court
reviewed
the
legislative
history
of
both
sentences,
said
that
the
harrington
amendment
as
originally
worded
--
pardon
me,
threatened
to
prevent
all
consolidations
to
which
it
related
and
that
as
reported
out
of
the
second
conference
it
contained,
a
substantial
change
which
limited
it
to
the
four
years
following
the
effective
date
--
pardon
me,
of
the
commission's
order
of
approval.
the
only
reference
in
court's
decision
to
the
prohibitory
effect
of
the
harrington
amendment
was
where
it
said
that
the
harrington
amendment's
otherwise
prohibitory
effect
was
limited
time
wise.
the
--
that
were
the
only
reference
to
prohibitory
effect
was
to
the
statement
that
it
threatened
to
prevent
all
consolidations.
no
other
limitation
was
considered
by
this
court
in
that
decision,
as
we
view
it,
as
having
been
placed
upon
the
harrington
amendment.
and
in
the
ort
case,
this
court
supported
its
decision
that
job
stabilization
was
a
bargainable
issue
under
the
railway
labor
act
and
therefore,
not
subject
to
the
injunctive
procedures
under
norris-laguardia.
by
referring
to
the
second
sentence
of
section
5
(2)
(f)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
by
reading
that
sentence
in
this
way,
section
5
(2)
(f)
requires
the
commission
to
protect
employees
by
including
terms
and
conditions
which
provide
that
for
a
term
of
years
after
a
consolidation,
employees
shall
not
be
placed
in
a
worse
position
with
respect
to
their
employment
than
they
otherwise
would
have
been.
that
this
statement
appears
to
be
a
recognition
of
the
employment
protection
provided
by
5
(2)
(f).
it
is
confirmed,
we
believe,
by
reference
to
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
ort
case,
which
stated
that
nothing
in
section
5
(2)
(f)
authorized
the
commission
to
freeze
existing
jobs
and
quoted
from
the
court's
opinion
of
the
rlea
case
as
follows,
“so
harrington
proviso,
this
court
said
in
railway
labor
executives'
association
against
united
states
that
it
threatened
to
prevent
all
consolidations
to
which
it
related,
but
congress
made
it
workable
by
putting
a
time
limit
upon
its
otherwise
prohibitory
effect.”
the
dissent
goes
on
to
say,
“if
congress
did
more,
it
eliminated
any
power
to
freeze
jobs.”
now,
this
dissenting
opinion
seems
to
us,
clearly
to
recognize
that
the
language
quoted
by
the
court
in
the
rlea
case
interprets
the
four-year
limit
as
the
--
time
limit
as
the
only
time
limit
placed
upon
employment
protection
in
the
harrington
amendment.
the
--
the
plain
language
of
this
statute,
we
believe,
is
clear.
it
requires
employment
protection.
it
speaks
only
in
terms
of
employment.
the
legislative
history,
we
believe,
is
clear.
mr.
harrington
is
the
man
to
whom
we
must
go.
he
is
the
author
and
to
--
also
to
the
proponents
of
this
legislation.
and
they
were
quite
clear
in
what
they
meant.
now,
if
this
were
unwise
legislation,
if
this
meant
that
there
would
be
some
employees
for
some
time
carried
over
and
they
wouldn't
have
any
work
to
do
perhaps.
it
doesn't
mean
the
railroad
couldn't
split
it
up
and
provide
work
perhaps,
but
suppose
they
wouldn't
have
any
work
to
do,
that
as
we
respectfully
submit,
is
for
congress
to
decide
and
not
for
the
court
and
i'm
sure
the
court
agrees
if
it
were
to
find
that
that
is
what
the
law
says.
but
in
this
case,
that
won't
happen,
because
as
they
have
said,
“862
men
would
be
the
only
ones
deprived
of
employment
and
they
would
only
be
deprived
because
they
wouldn't
transfer”
and
under
this
law,
they
would
have
to
transfer,
as
---
as
we
view
it,
they
would
have
to
transfer.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
in
the
exhibits
and
in
the
statements
of
the
railroad
before
the
commission,
they
said
that
only
862
men
would
be
deprived
of
their
jobs.
if
your
honor
would
care
to
look
at
the
--
these
foldout
pages
at
104
of
the
printed
transcript
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
sir
i
believe
this
is
the
one.
no,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
it's
at
112.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
has
it
--
jobs
refused
863,
employees
deprived
of
employment,
863.
that's
at
numbers
8
and
9
now
that
first
column.
now,
that
863
is
the
total
over
the
five-year
period.
these
are
transfers
which
are
refused
and
employees
who
would
be
deprived
of
employment
and
that
was
explained
as
meaning,
employees
who
refused
to
take
the
job.
they
would
be
the
only
ones
deprived
of
employment
and
obviously,
this
meant
available
jobs
and
they
could
go
to
those,
but
they
were
decided
they
wouldn't
go
to
them.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
your
honor,
when
i
look
at
something
like
this,
i
wonder
myself
and
i
never
know
how
they
reached
these
conclusions.
and
i
--
and
in
a
case
like
this,
you
can't
begin
to
get
into
it,
because
they
have
work
papers
piled
up
six
feet
high.
but
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
accept
their
figure,
i
can't
challenge
it
and
this
is
their
figure.
the
attrition
rate
as
also
appears
on
this
exhibit,
shows
why
this
might
happen.
in
five
years,
they
are
going
to
abolish
2000
jobs,
they
expect.
in
that
same
period,
12,000
would
be
created
by
attrition.
now,
this
might
not
mean
there
would
be
600%
in
each
category
of
employment.
maybe
it's
12,001
and
--
and
50%
in
another,
over
a
period.
but
that
is
the
purpose
as
stated
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
why
this
statute
was
passed,
not
to
throw
people
out
of
employment,
but
to
keep
the
employment
situation
where
it
is
and
as
you
--
as
your
honors
know,
in
the
railroad
industry
today,
the
employment
situation
is
very
bad
and
it
is
threatened
considerably
by
these
mergers.
so
we
ask
your
honors,
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history,
on
the
basis
of
the
plain
language,
on
the
basis
of
your
decisions
in
the
--
in
the
rlea
and
ort
cases
that
you
reverse
the
district
court
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
solicitor
general,
in
his
argument,
said
that
the
employees
were
given
full
protection,
full
protection
by
the
financial
protection
which
was
given
under
these
new
orleans
conditions.
i
respectfully
direct
your
attention
to
the
bottom
of
page
23
and
at
the
top
of
page
24
of
our
brief
where
we
set
out
at
least
some
of
the
things
that
are
not
protected
by
the
new
orleans
conditions.
a
man's
job
is
abolished.
his
work
is
abolished.
his
employment
with
the
railroad
industry
today
is
abolished.
that
isn't
protected.
they're
not
protected
from
accum
--
from
the
loss
of
accumulated
rights
under
the
railroad
retirement
act.
they
don't
--
he
is
not
protected
from
forever
being
deprived
of
employment
in
the
railroad
industry,
an
industry
in
which
he
may
have
spent
years
developing
skills
which
are
not
readily
adaptable
to
other
industries.
now,
there
was
also
mentioned
made,
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
black,
of
mr.
wheeler's
statement.
and,
on
page
67
of
our
brief,
we
quote
mr.
wheeler
said
--
senator
wheeler
said.
now,
this
quotation
is
not
in
passing,
as
the
solicitor
general
said.
this
is
a
statement
taken
in
its
entirety
from
the
official
interpretation
which
is
placed
upon
the
transportation
act
of
1940
by
the
senate
and
its
sponsor
of
the
act,
senator
wheeler.
all
they
say
--
all
he
says
about
the
protection
afforded
under
5
(2)
(f)
is
that
the
present
law
is
also
amended
by
the
inclusion
of
the
harrington
amendment
to
protect
the
employees.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
the
--
this
provision,
"worse
position
with
respect
to
employment,"
was
consistently
referred
to
by
everyone
as
the
harrington
amendment.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
modified
language.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
now
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
now,
the
--
with
regard
to
the
--
this
language
and
the
solicitor
general's
reference
to
the
conference
report,
he
states
that
the
conference
report
recognizes
a
distinction
between
the
original
language
of
the
harrington
amendment
and
the
language
as
found
in
the
wadsworth
motion
to
recommit.
now,
please
understand
that
we
do
not
claim
there
is
no
distinction
in
that
language.
what
we
say,
though,
is
what
does
that
language
mean?
it
is
distinct.
they
eliminated
displacement.
but,
what
does
the
language
mean?
mr.
harrington
told
us
what
it
meant,
and
all
those
who
spoke
in
support
of
that
language
told
us
exactly
what
it
meant.
now,
in
commenting
upon
the
original
harrington
amendment,
the
statement
of
the
commission
on
this
point
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
its
entirety,
insofar
as
it
referred
to
the
harrington
amendment,
and
that
statement
shows
quite
clearly
that
the
only
reference,
the
only
reference
which
the
commission
made
and
the
only
objection
the
commission
had,
apparently,
to
the
original
language
of
the
harrington
amendment
was
that
it
prohibited
displacement.
and,
i
refer
your
honors
to
page
46
of
our
brief
where
this
is
the
statement
of
the
commission
on
the
original
harrington
amendment
is
set
forth.
"employees
who
may
be
displaced
should,
in
the
case
of
railroad
unifications,
be
protected
by
some
such
plan
as
is
embodied
in
the
so-called
washington
agreement."
the
proviso
by
prohibiting
any
displacement
of
employees
goes
much
too
far.
now,
it
is
significant
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
made
no
comment
whatever
on
the
modified
language.
displacement
had
been
removed
and
it
--
did
not
come
back
and
comment
upon
that.
now,
that
is
the
distinction
between
the
original
language
of
the
harrington
amendment,
and
the
modified
language
of
that
amendment
is
found
in
the
wadsworth
motion
to
recommit.
the
references
to
the
comments,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
of
mr.
harrington's
interpretation
of
this
modified
language,
and
mr.
justice
black
asked
whether
anyone
challenged
these
statements.
and,
the
answer
was,
"no,
they
did
not
challenge
the
statement"
and,
in
truth,
there
was
no
challenge
to
this
interpretation.
but,
when
mr.
lea
interpreted
this
language
as
meaning
that
employees
must
be
retained
in
their
employment
or
be
paid
compensation
for
life
if
they're
not
retained
in
employment.
mr.
harrington,
on
two
separate
occasions,
told
mr.
lea
that,
"you
are
wrong.
it
does
not
mean
what
you
say
it
means.
this
is
intended
to
preserve
only
the
employment
and
attrition
will
take
care
of
the
job
eliminations.
this
preserves
the
employment
relationship
--
the
active
employment
relationship
of
these
men."
now,
he
was
specifically
told
that
twice
and
those
statements
appear
in
our
brief
at
pages
54
and
55.
in
the
first
instance,
he
quotes
a
letter
from
president
whitney
of
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen.
he
quotes
this
in
confirmation
of
his
own
position,
harrington's
own
position.
your
address,
as
reported
in
the
daily
congressional
record
of
may
3rd,
suggest
that
your
conception
of
the
labor
provision
is
entirely
erroneous.
you
erroneously
refer
to
the
proposed
labor
protection
as
a
dismissal
ways
provision.
now,
he
says
in
the
course
of
that
that
they
want
to
preserve
the
employment
of
these
people.
that
is
the
purpose
of
this
entire
thing.
now,
with
regard
to
the
statements
regarding
the
whether
--
the
contest
here,
this
wasn't
a
contest,
as
the
solicitor
general
says.
it's
whether
employees
are
going
to
have
any
protection
at
all.
they
already
had
protection.
the
lowden
decision
which
is
discussed
in
our
brief,
united
states
against
lowden,
the
lower
court,
the
commission,
everybody
had
given
the
employees
protection
in
--
in
consolidation
of
facilities.
the
agitation
here
was
what
type
of
protection
should
they
have
and
whether
it
should
be
protection
in
their
way
of
preservation
of
their
active
employment
with
the
railroad
and
let
attrition
take
care
of
the
job
eliminations
or
should
it
be
just
compensation
protection.
and,
that
was
the
contest
and
these
--
the
proponents
of
the
job
protection,
the
employment
protection,
the
preservation,
they
didn't
lose
this.
they
compromised
but
they
didn't
lose
it
and
this
is
the
entire
battle
that
was
in
congress
in
the
house
of
representatives
at
that
time.
they
had
protection
and
it
was
the
type
of
protection
they
were
to
have,
and
they
ended
up
with
a
more
flexible
type
of
preservation
of
active
employment
than
they
would
have
had
under
the
harrington
amendment.
the
--
as
i
say,
the
entire
agitation
was
what
type
of
protection
should
they
have
in
mergers.
they
got,
as
we
say,
preservation
of
their
active
work
with
the
railroad.
but,
there
were
no
mergers
after
this
statute
was
enacted,
as
congress
expected.
we
had
prosperity
through
the
war
years.
the
merger
started
to
come
only
a
few
years
ago,
and
the
first
merger
was
the
norfolk
&
western
and,
in
that
case,
the
railroad
agreed
to
retain
all
employees
in
their
employment
and
let
attrition
take
care
of
these
other
employee
--
of
--
excuse
me,
of
the
job
elimination.
the
next
case
that
came
along
was
this
case,
and
this
issue
was
raised.
that
is
why
it
has
not
been
raised
heretofore,
because
it
was
to
protect
the
employees,
the
labor
force
of
the
industry
when
that
force
was
--
was
threatened
by
the
merger
provisions,
and
it
is
only
threatened
now.
the
statements
of
mr.
mcafee
regarding
the
effect
on
employees,
most
of
these
things,
i
assure
you,
gentlemen,
certainly
the
commission
can
take
care
of.
and,
his
statements
as
to
what
will
happen
to
these
employees,
that
they'll
have
so
many
employees
left
over,
just
do
not
jive
with
the
evidence
which
they
submitted
that
only
862
men
would
be
deprived
of
their
employment
and
not
only
because
they
refused
to
transfer.
also,
he
made
some
comment
about
under
the
new
orleans'
conditions,
they
don't
have
to
transfer.
well,
that's
what
the
railroad's
witness
said.
then,
the
vice
president
of
operations
got
on
the
stand
and
said,
"oh
yes,
they
do
have
to
transfer.
we're
not
going
to
pay
these
fellows
if
they're
not
going
to
transfer
when
we've
got
jobs
for
them."
mr.
mcafee
comes
back
and
says,
"well,
now,
they
don't
have
to
transfer
under
the
new
orleans'
condition."
but,
we
state
quite
clearly
that,
under
this,
they
would
have
to
transfer.
so,
those
862
men
would
have
jobs
to
go
to.
there's
no
bumping
in
the
seniority
involved
in
this
because,
again,
there
are
jobs
to
go
to.
they
don't
have
to
bump
anybody.
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
there
would
be
no
dual
system,
your
honor.
they
would
merge
the
accounting
system.
they
would
have
one
accounting
system.
now,
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
extra
employees
in
that
one
accounting
system
for
a
while.
an
attrition
would
take
--
they
would
have
to
wait
for
attrition
to
take
care
of
those
employees
or
they
would
have
to,
say,
split
the
worker
or
something
of
that
nature
but
there
would
be
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
in
every
merger
case
or
--
that
we've
had,
this
last
merger
case
of
course
and
there
had
been
other
cases
involving
small
mergers
over
the
last
20
years
which
were
of
no
significance
at
all,
insofar
as
effect
on
the
employee
--
employment
in
the
industry
was
concerned,
in
those
cases,
they
have
always
merged
the
seniority
rank.
if
they
had
agreements
and
they've
merged
the
rosters,
because
the
railroad
can't
go
on
forever
with
two
sets
of
agreements
when
it's
only
got
one
set
of
employees,
and
they
would
merge
eventually.
they
will
get
together
and
merge
that
and
work
that
out.
and,
this
employment
protection
is
not
in
--
directed
just
to
all
employees.
it
is
directed
to
the
employees
who
are
working
on
the
railroad.
that's
the
same
thing
that,
at
the
time
that
the
merger
takes
place,
it's
the
same
thing
as
an
african-western
agreement
applied
to
the
employees
who
working
as
of
the
date
of
the
agreement,
june
18,
1958.
that's
who
got
this
preservation
of
their
employment
relationship
with
the
railroad
and
that,
your
honors,
is
what
we
say
would
be
done
here.
insofar
as
the
statements
mr
--
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
thank
you
--
mr.
william
g.
mahoney
well,
your
honor,
the
--
of
all
the
excerpts
that
the
appellees
could
find,
that
excerpt
and
the
excerpt
from,
i
think
it
is,
the
conductor's
journals
are
the
only
two
which
really
state
that
this
is
--
this
is
pure
dismissal
pay.
this
is
pay
you
get
when
you're
dismissed.
and,
i
say
they
took
that
position
very
probably,
i
don't
know
why,
they
took
the
position
very
probably
because
they
felt
that
--
because
they
have,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
been
for
nothing
but
compensation
protection.
that
was
what
they
were
after.
they
felt
that
was
what
they
got.
they
may
have
assumed.
i
don't
know,
that
the
second
sentence
did
nothing
else.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
same
thing
was
said
of
these
same
unions
in
the
new
orleans
case
and
the
commission's
construction
of
that
statute
as
meaning
--
as
having
the
four
years
as
a
ceiling,
a
maximum,
and
this
court
held
that
the
four
years
wasn't
a
maximum.
it
was
a
minimum,
and
it
had
always
been
assumed
by
everybody
up
until
that
point,
practically,
that
the
four
years
was
a
maximum
and
not
a
minimum.
so
that,
i
suppose,
if
you
get
right
down
to
it,
your
--
where
something
like
this
where
one
of
your
own
clients
has
said
right
at
the
beginning
that
this
is
the
dismissal
way,
that
he
was
wrong
about
his
interpretation
of
that
statute
as
implied
to
him.
as
i
understand,
abraham
lincoln
once
said,
when
that
questioned
was
thrown
to
him
in
the
afternoon,
he
said,
"i
might
have
been
wrong
in
the
morning,
but
i
know
i'm
right
this
afternoon."
and,
that
is
really
the
--
the
only
defense
to
that
state.
thank
you,
your
honor.
