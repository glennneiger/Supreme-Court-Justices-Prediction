justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
understand
your
position
on
that.
i
wish
you'd
explain
it.
i
had
assumed
that
the
difference
between
you
and
the
government
was
that,
although
under
the
plan,
a
laid
off
employee
got
all
of
his
compensation,
all
of
his
salary,
all
of
his
moving
expenses,
all
of
his
rights
in
every
other
respect
that
your
view
was
that
it
still
did
not
satisfy
the
terms
of
the
act
and
that
the
government's
characterization
which
you
disclaim
now
is
fair
characterization
of
your
position
that
the
man
had
to
continue
in
the
position
in
which
he
was
employed.
