mr.
ray,
this
case
was
brought
under
the
jones
act,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
also
an
allegation
of
unseaworthiness
in
the
complaint.
did
that
drop
out
of
the
case
during
the
trial?
there's
no
discussion
of
unseaworthiness
that
i
could
find
in
the
--
in
the
motion,
in
your
motion
or
in
the
judges'
ruling
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
a
directed
verdict
or
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
justice

negligence
case.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
jones
act
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
can
rule
only
for
negligence
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
all
tied
up
in
one
cause
of
action
in
your
complaint.
under
the
jones
act,
there
is
no
liability
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
no
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
because,
i
suppose,
this
is
a
case
where
their
questions
involved
was
whether
these
tools
were
or
were
not
defective,
that
is
whether
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
show
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
were
defective
and
i
suppose,
in
this
case,
there's
no
difference
if
the
tools
--
justice
potter
stewart
you're
right.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
did
consider
it
and
still
affirmed
the
judgment
and
thereby,
you
implicitly
say
that
they
--
that
--
or
you
say
that
their
implicit
ruling
was
that
it
should
have
been
admitted
rather
than
excluded,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
they
are
saying,
in
effect,
isn't
it,
that
even
if
it
had
been
admitted,
they
were
still
no
--
there
was
still
not
enough
evidence
to
take
a
case
to
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
the
trial
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
cannel.
