did
you
present
that
question?
justice

in
the
petition
for
certiorari?

(inaudible)
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice

where
is
that?

page
what?

(inaudible)
justice

black
what
page
was
that?
justice

black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
wrench
produced?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
to
see
if
i
can
get
it
clear.
did
i
understand
in
what
you
say
was
they
had
the
nut
here,
they
are
going
to
work
on
--
on
the
table
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
reaches
up
and
puts
that
on
as
well
as
it
would
get
on,
whatever
that
is.
he
screws
it
to
the
right
place
so
it
would
be
fastened
and
in
order
to
have
moved
the
nut
around,
he
hits
it
with
a
mallet
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
taking
it
off.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
said.
he
hits
it
out
--
he
puts
it
on
there.
he
can't
move
it
with
his
hand
and
he
hits
it
with
a
mallet
or
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
here,
it
was
a
mallet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
didn't
care
whether
it
was
on
or
off.
you
can
tighten
it
that
way
or
you
can
loosen
it
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
happen
to
done
both.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
fastened
on
there
so
that
it
will
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
fall
off
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
hit
it
with
a
mallet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
to
be
put
on
tightly
and
it
has
to
be
of
such
nature
that
it
would
hold
when
it's
put
there,
so
that
you
won't
knock
it
off
when
you
hit
it
with
a
mallet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
--
and
if
it
is,
if
you
--
if,
for
some
reason,
the
man
didn't
put
it
on
tight
enough
or
if
he
couldn't
put
it
on
tight,
if
it
just
wasn't
tight
enough
to
hold,
it
might
be
knocked
off
when
you
hit
it
with
a
mallet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
evidently,
that's
what
happened
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
don't
mean
whether
it
was
loosened
from
his
cause
or
somebody
else's.
what
happened,
as
i
--
am
i
wrong?
i
thought,
from
reading
you,
when
he
hit
it,
it
fell
off.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
that
--
is
that
the
theory
on
which
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
his
evidence
rested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
hit
it
up
straight
up,
of
course,
it
would
slip.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
any
event,
it
would
have
had
to
been
lose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
was
so
tight,
you
couldn't
knock
it
all
by
hitting
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now,
if
it
was
--
what
i'm
getting
at,
i
don't
know,
but
i
would
assume
that
if
that
was
at
the
place
where
it
collapsed,
i
presume
it
was
precise.
it
was
most
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
was
so-called
--
use
some
other
word
besides
(inaudible).
if
the
place
where
it
drenched
was
frayed
or
worn
out
or
was
--
so
that
it
wouldn't
hold
well,
that
would
make
it
come
off
easily,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hold
down
and
then
--
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
you
say
is
that's
not
enough
to
show
that
the
company
is
responsible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
--
they
were
descriptive.
it
was
chewed
up
there,
chewed
up
there
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
it's
chewed
up
and
it
slipped
from
it.
i
suppose
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
should
be
the
part
where
it
totally
slipped.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said
it's
battered,
decrepit
and
chewed
up
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
kept
slipping.
he
had
a
hard
time
making
it
stay
on
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
kept
slipping
off.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
be
because
it's
battered
up
on
the
hammer,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
object
to
the
evidence
on
that
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
other
day
to
which
he
would
testify?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
he
describe
--
where
is
the
--
how
did
he
describe
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
particular
wrench
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
wrenches
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
testified
about
the
wrenches?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
were
and
nine
days
before,
he
had
seen
them,
do
you
think
you
say
that
evidence
wouldn't
be
admissible
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
were
metal
wrenches,
weren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
he
would
have
to
know
that?
if
he
known
it
the
day
before,
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
day
before
he
testified
he
saw
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
these
alloy
wrenches?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
he
claiming
about
it
to
the
jury?
would
he
testify
that
nine
days
before,
if
he
did,
that
these
were
all
beaten
up
and
chewed
up?
does
that
--
is
there
any
rule
that
would
allow
any
judge
anywhere
to
exclude
that
evidence
as
to
what
the
situation
these
wrenches
were
in,
nine
days
before?
do
you
know
of
any
rule
that
would
exclude
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
a
steam
engine
and
they
showed
how
it
was
nine
days
before,
metal
steam
engine,
would
you
say
that
he'd
have
to
say,
“i
saw
it
on
the
day
the
man
was
hurt
by
the
steam
engine”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
that
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
must
have
seen
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
no
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
no
man
could
reasonably
find
evidence
that
there
was
a
tool
which
was
badly
beaten
up,
chewed
up
and
so
forth
and
then
he
tried
to
use
it,
had
great
difficulty
in
using
it
and
finally
slipped
off?
that
no
reasonable
man
could
find
that
it
was
defective.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
they
said
he's
old
and
decrepit
and
lame
nine
days
before
the
accident,
that
would
be
evidence
and
he's
still
decrepit
and
old
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
afraid
it
would.
i
speak
from
experience.
