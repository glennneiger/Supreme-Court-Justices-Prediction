did
that
testimony
that
you
rely
on
acquitted
in
the
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
--
this
is
at
11,
this
wrench
keeps
slipping
off,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
else
besides
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
he
say
"all
chewed
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
--
where
does
it
say
“all
chewed
up”?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
yes,
i
have
it.
thank
you.
and
now,
all
of
this
testimony
on
which
you
relied
on
raise
the
jury
questions
in
the
petitioner's
testimony,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
quite
get
that.
how
--
how
is
he
hitting
this
with
a
mallet,
on
the
top
of
the
handle?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
the
evidence
show?
how
was
the
wrench,
was
it
perpendicular
or
horizontal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
who
was
wheeling
the
mallet?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
don't
know
what
--
was
he
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
putting
it
this
way
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
theory
is
that
the
worn
end,
or
whatever
it
was,
slipped
off
because
it
didn't
have
sufficient
grip?
