mr.
lucian
y.
ray
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
determination
of
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
negligence
in
a
personal
injury
case,
we
suggest,
your
honors,
involves,
initially,
the
exercise
of
judicial
judgment.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
asking
this
court
to
substitute
his
judgment
in
that
particular
for
the
judgment
of
the
two
courts,
both
of
which
considered
that
--
those
questions
very
exhaustibly
-
the
trial
court
in
hearing
the
testimony,
the
circuit
court
in
reading
the
record,
and
the
circuit
court
filed,
as
this
court
knows,
having
examine
the
record,
a
seven-page
per
curiam
opinion
in
which
nearly
--
in
which
all,
i
would
say
after
an
examination
of
the
record
carefully,
in
which
all
of
the
testimony
upon
which
the
petitioner
relies
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
the
circuit
court
has
said
that,
considering
that
testimony
in
its
most
favorable
light
to
the
petitioner,
it
found
no
evidence
of
negligence
or
unseaworthiness
which
was
approximate
cause
of
the
man's
accident.
now,
we
agree
with
my
friend
here
that
the
sole
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
petitioner's
testimony
considered
in
his
most
favorable
light
presented
the
jury
question.
we
say
to
your
honors
that
it's
not
a
question
of
the
weighing
of
conflicting
testimony.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
balancing
of
testimony.
it's
simply
a
question
of
taking
his
testimony
and
saying
whether
a
jury
question
is
presented.
before
--
before
adverting
to
the
three
faults
which
were
alleged
in
the
complaint,
i'd
like
to
bring
these
two
facts
to
the
attention
of
the
court
so
that
the
court
may
understand
the
background
of
the
situation.
this
man
had
been
not
only
a
seaman
for
three
years
on
the
vessels
owned
by
this
respondent
which
were
tankers,
all
of
them
are
tankers,
but
he
had
had
prior
experience.
he
was
a
fireman
but
the
uncontradicted
testimony
in
the
trial
court
was
that,
during
the
lay-up
--
lay-out
--
the
lay-up
and
fill-up
of
these
vessels,
it
was
part
of
the
fireman's
duties
to
work
in
the
pumproom
and
to
work
on
the
pumps.
so,
he
was
not
unpermitted
with
the
task
that
he
had
and
may
i
suggest
to
--
may
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
on
the
question
of
instruction,
which
apparently
was
an
afterthought
because
it
was
not
a
charged
fault
in
the
complaint,
lack
of
instruction,
that
he
admitted
--
he
admitted
that
the
--
in
his
testimony,
you
will
find
it
on
page
10
of
the
record,
that
the
pumpman
had
instructed
him
how
to
remove
these
knots.
and
i
say
to
this
court
that
whether
the
pumpman
had
instructed
him
or
not,
certainly,
the
putting
of
a
wrench
--
an
open-faced
wrench
on
these
20
nuts
on
the
casing
of
a
centrifugal
pump,
hitting
them
--
hitting
the
handle
or
the
grip
of
that
wrench
with
a
mallet
is
a
rather
simple
operation
and
wouldn't
require
instruction
or
supervision.
now,
there
are
--
there
are
three
faults.
one
was
the
allege
lack
of
proper
light,
one,
the
alleged
lack
of
proper
space
and
the
third,
the
alleged
defective
wrench.
now,
i'd
like
to
consider
the
testimony
relative
to
the
first
two
and
consider
the
wrench
last
because,
apparently,
that's
the
most
important.
now,
there's
a
--
there's
a
rather
substantial
amount
of
testimony
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
lighting
situation,
but
it
consisted
principally
of
the
wattage,
the
amount
of
the
globes,
how
much
wattage
they
had,
the
distance
from
the
pump,
and
the
deadlights,
where
they
were
located,
whether
the
deadlights
were
clean
or
whether
they
were
not.
but
the
court
will
find,
upon
examination
of
this
record,
that
there
is
not
iota
of
testimony
in
which
this
petitioner
suggested
that
the
light
affected
in
any
way
his
ability
to
do
the
job
that
he
was
doing.
and
i
ask
him
on
cross
examination
whether
he
had
any
difficulty
seeing
those
nuts
and
he
said,
“i
did
not
have
any
difficulty,”
and
i
say
to
your
honors
that,
that
--
on
that
issue,
that
laid
that
issue
at
rest.
there
is
no
affirmative
testimony
on
his
part
that
he
was
having
any
difficulty
because
of
the
lighting
situation
and
seeing
the
casing,
the
nuts,
the
mallet,
and
the
wrench
and
he
admitted
affirmatively,
in
response
to
my
question,
that
he
had
no
difficulty.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that,
your
honor,
is
on
page
26
of
the
record.
i
asked
him,
“you
had
no
difficulty
seeing
the
bolts,
did
you?”
answer,
“no,
sir.”
now,
in
respect
to
the
lack
of
working
space,
here,
again,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony
relating
to
the
measurements
in
the
pumproom
--
of
the
pumproom,
the
location
of
the
bulkheads
in
the
pumproom,
the
fact
that
there
were
pipes
in
the
pumproom,
and
that
there
were
girders
in
the
pumproom.
there
was
--
there
was
some
testimony
as
to
measurements.
there
is
not
one
--
there
is
that
kind
of
statistical
testimony
that
there
is
not
one
iota
of
testimony
in
which
it
can
even
been
be
inferred
that
he
was
being
hampered
in
any
way
in
caring
out
this
job.
and
he
was
asked
--
he
was
asked
to
explain
how
he
did
the
job
and
he
said
he
put
--
he
put
the
wrench
on
--
he
put
the
wrench
on
the
nuts
and
then
he
--
then,
he
hit
the
wrench
with
the
mallet.
and
in
answer
to
justice
brennan's
question,
while
it
isn't
entirely
clear
in
the
record,
i
think
it
can
be
assumed
that
it
was
done
horizontally
because
if
you'll
examine
the
--
you'll
examine
the
photographs
that
appear
in
the
back
of
the
record
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
pumps
and
the
casing,
that's
the
only
way
it
could
be
done.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
some
of
them
show
where
--
where
the
casing
has
been
removed.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
it
showed
--
it
doesn't
show
the
nut.
pardon
me,
justice
whittaker.
it
show
--
it
doesn't
show
the
nuts
themselves.
it
shows
the
bolts
because
the
casing
has
been
lifted
up.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
was
standing
over
--
he's
standing
to
the
side
of
the
pump,
your
honor.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
looking
at
103?
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
would
--
you
see,
the
casing
would
be
down
and
the
nut
would
--
the
nut
would
be
above
that
hole
on
top
of
the
casing.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
and
then,
he
would
--
he
would
be
to
the
side
of
it
and
he
put
the
--
he
put
the
wrench
on
there
and
--
in
a
horizontal
position
and
then
he
would
take
the
mallet
and
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
on
top
of
the
casing.
i
assume
that
that's
true.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
sir.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
no,
this
is
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
--
you
see,
he
was
taking
it
off.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
justice
black
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
--
black,
and
this
was
a
centrifugal
pump
used
for
the
pumping
of
cargo
and
it
had
to
be
tight.
it
had
to
form
a
gasket
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
it
had
to
form
a
gasket
and
he
was
--
he
was
removing
the
nuts
to
take
the
casing
off,
so
that
he
put
on
there
and
he
had
to
--
in
order
to
start
the
nut
being
taken
off,
he
had
to
hit
it
with
the
mallet
and
then
he
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
then,
he
probably
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
i
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes.
i
misunderstood
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
thought
you
were
describing
the
putting
on
of
the
nuts.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes.
in
one
--
in
one
instance
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
--
in
one
instance,
the
hitting
of
--
with
the
mallet
is
the
last
thing
you
do
if
your
tightening
it.
and
when
you're
taking
it
off,
the
hitting
with
the
mallet
is
the
first
thing
you
do
to
loosen
it.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
form
a
gasket.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
and
it
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
and
it
has
to
--
it
has
to
be
put
tightly
on,
as
i
say,
to
form
a
gasket
so
the
pump
itself
will
work
efficiently.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
use
a
mallet
to
start
--
to
get
it
off.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
and
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
i
say
this
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
let's
--
i
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
some
--
somewhere
along
--
i
mean,
at
that
time,
we
assumed
that
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
--
of
course,
he
was
the
only
one
who
was
there.
and
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
it
--
it
apparently
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
--
it
--
it
apparently,
at
that
time
that
--
here's
what
happened,
and
this
is
significant.
there
were
20
bolts
and
nuts
on
this
--
on
this
pump
casing.
now,
he
had
taken
off
either
15
or
16
because
he
had
practically
completed
this
job.
he
was
either
on
the
16th
bolt
or
the
16th
nut
at
the
time
when
this
occurred.
in
other
words,
he'd
taken
off
15
or
16
of
those
nuts.
and
it's
--
when
he
got
to
this
17th,
let's
--
let's
say,
and
was
probably
going
through
the
same
operation
that
he
had
on
the
other
thing
that
something
happened.
now,
he
said
that
--
he
said
that
the
wrench
slipped.
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
fact
that
the
wrench
slipped
is
not
significant
and
doesn't
--
and
doesn't
establish
negligence.
and
there's
no
evidence
of
negligence
because
it
could
--
it
could
slip
for
several
reasons.
it
could
slip
from
the
--
from
--
as
a
result
of
the
position
on
which
he
--
on
which
he
--
which
he
had
the
wrench
on
that
nut.
that's
one
thing
it
could
slip
off.
it
could
slip
from
the
way
he
hit
the
--
the
handle
with
a
mallet.
in
other
words,
let's
assume
he
didn't
hit
it
--
he
didn't
hit
it
squarely.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
or
--
or
came
like
this
or
down
like
that.
that
might
cause
it
to
slip.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
it
would
come
--
it
--
well,
it
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
no,
it
could
fit
there
perfect
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
except
this,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
i
mean,
you
don't
have
wrenches.
this
wrench
was
--
was
designed
to
fit
this
particular
nut.
in
other
words,
it
was
an
open-face
wrench,
a
wrench
with
a
--
like
that,
and
was
--
it
had
the
same
dimensions
as
the
nut
that
it
went
on.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
no,
it
wasn't
and
--
but
of
course,
they
don't
fit
like
--
they
don't
have
like
a
--
with
a
micrometer
put
on
it.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
have
it
in
a
position
so
they
can
put
it
on
the
nut
initially.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
yes.
that's
sort
of
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
--
octagonal
or
something.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
--
i
believe
it
would.
but
i
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
--
but
i
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
true,
and
i
say
this,
your
honor,
i
say
that
there's
no
evidence
at
all
in
this
record
that
--
that
even
suggest
that
that's
--
that
that's
the
situation.
in
other
words,
the
court
below
and
--
and
mr.
goldstein
described
the
--
the
testimony
as
being
simply
descriptive,
adjective
and
that's
all
they
were.
in
other
words
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
but
what
was
chewed
up,
your
honor?
there
isn't
one
single
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
there
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
but
--
you're
doing
now
what
you
wouldn't
permit
a
--
a
district
court
--
i
mean,
a
jury
to
do.
you're
speculating,
i
think,
your
honor,
because
there
isn't
one
--
one
reference
at
all
to
the
open
jaw
of
that
wrench,
not
one.
there
isn't
one
reference
to
the
--
to
the
handle
of
that
wrench.
all
they
say
is
that
it's
old,
it's
beaten
up,
it's
battered,
it's
decrepit.
now,
there
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
chewed
up.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
but
it
could
--
but
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
that
could
slip
from
--
from
--
for
three
or
four
different
reasons.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
don't
know.
well,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
or
not.
and
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
this
court
can
assume
that
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
105.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor,
whether
it
stayed
up
or
it's
down
or
fall
off.
i
mean,
what
if
--
what
if
i
should
--
i
mean,
it
would
depend
on
how
it
was
placed
on
there.
i
would
say
this,
that
this
man,
using
this
wrench
that
he
described
after
this
has
occurred
and
that
he
didn't
report
to
even
a
man
who
was
in
the
pumproom
with
him,
didn't
report
this
accident
and
didn't
report
to
any
officer
for
three
months
later,
i
would
say
that
he
got
16
of
these
nuts
off
using
this
all
beat-up
decrepit
wrench
and
after
all,
the
thing
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
that
wrench
that
he
used
was
able
to
perform
the
function
for
which
it
was
being
used,
and
that
was
to
take
those
nuts
off.
and
i
think
the
court
below
was
100%
correct
in
saying
that
you
--
that
you
do
not
get
to
the
question
of
negligence
in
this
case
by
simply
saying
that
something
is
defective,
something
is
old,
something
is
decrepit.
you've
got
to
--
you've
got
to
pinpoint
this
proposition.you've
got
to
--
let's
refer
to
the
jacob's
case.
i'd
say
this,
that
if
there
would
have
been
the
proof
in
this
case
than
there
was
in
the
jacob's
case,
that
you
had
a
lot
of
play
in
the
jaw
of
that
wrench
like
there
was
in
the
jacob's
case,
i'd
say
--
i
would
say
that
the
court
probably
should
have
sent
that
--
let
that
case
go
to
the
jury.
now
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
what
does
chew
up
--
chewed
up
mean?
that's
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
i
would
think
the
question
would
be
whether
they
have
a
right
to,
your
honor,
in
other
words,
whether
that
would
be
pure
speculation.
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
still
--
maybe
i'll
admit
that
i
am
not
an
unprejudiced
in
this
situation.
wi
mean,
i
am
a
defense
lawyer
entirely
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
still
some
obligation
on
the
part
of
a
seaman
to
establish
fault,
and
this
court
has
not
ruled
otherwise.
i
appreciate
the
--
i
appreciate
the
--
and
the
court
below
appreciated
the
significance
of
the
roger
and
the
ferguson
case
and
said,
in
spite
of
it,
that
there
was
no
--
in
other
words,
that
it
isn't
a
question
of
weighing
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
negligence.
and
we
feel
--
i
think
that
there
is
still
the
obligation
of
the
plaintiff
to
prove
his
case,
to
introduce
some
evidence
of
negligence
and
that
this
is,
in
theory,
is
still
the
obligation
of
the
jury
not
to
speculate.
now,
if
there
had
been
faults
of
a-
in
respect
to
this
wrench,
they
could
have
been
pinpointed.
he
could
have
said
there
was
play
in
that
wrench.
he
could
have
said
that
--
that
it
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
don't'
think
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think
the
slipping
can
come
from,
as
i
say,
another
thing
the
slipping
can
come
from
are
the
bolts
themselves.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
even
though
they
don't
know
what
part
of
the
wrench
is
chewed
up,
is
that
right?
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
--
that
the
testimony
you
are
reading
there
are
conclusions
of
the
witness.
if
--
if
he
says
"this
--
this
tool
is
not
good,"
now,
that's
--
that's
his
conclusion,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that's
--
that
doesn't
--
that
--
the
jury
has
got
to
determine
whether
the
--
whether
the
tool
is
good.
he
--
it's
his
conclusion.
it's
not
a
statement
of
fact,
is
it?
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
that's
right
and
that's
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
--
it's
there.
i
didn't
object
to
it
but
as
i
say,
whether
it's
--
whether
it's
objected
to
or
not,
if
it's
a
conclusion,
it
isn't
--
it
doesn't
constitute
evidence,
does
it?
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
i
suggest
that
--
i
suggest
that
he
was
--
that
he
could
have
said
that
this
--
there
was
a
play
in
this
wrench.
it
just
simply
did
not
fit.
and
i
think
--
i
think
the
fact
that
he
got
16
or
17
of
these
nuts
off
is
a
very
significant
reputation
of
his
own
--
of
his
own
statement
there.
now,
there's
just
one
other
thing
and
then
i
will
close.
my
friend
has
adverted
to
the
testimony
of
the
second
mate.
at
the
--
at
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony,
a
motion
to
strike
was
made
and
the
court
did
not
strike
all
of
his
testimony.
the
court
struck
that
--
struck
the
testimony
which
related
to
his
description
of
the
condition
of
those
tools
as
of
the
date
of
the
accident.
now,
it
was
clearly
strike-able
on
that
ground.
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
condition
of
those
tools
at
that
time.
now,
the
remainder
of
his
testimony
was
not
stricken.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
he
testified,
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
sort
of
a,
i
wouldn't
say,
blunder-wise,
maybe
that
isn't
a
proper
descriptive
--
description
of
it
but
he
was
carrying
a
whole
five
years
prior
to
the
accident.
now,
he
left
the
vessel.
the
accident
allegedly
occurred
on
the
december
28,
1955
and
he
left
on
the
19th
of
december.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
described
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
didn't
describe
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
didn't
describe
the
particular
wrench.
he
described
all
the
tools
in
the
pumproom
tool
box
as
being
old
and
beat-up
and
battered,
and
he
didn't
--
he
couldn't
possibly
know,
as
was
suggested
in
answer
to
one
of
the
justices'
questions,
he
couldn't
possibly
know
which
particular
wrench
was
used.
he
just
made
a
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
--
about
wrenches
generally.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
said,
"all
of
them
were
all
decrepit
and
beat-up
and
battered."
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
they
were
made
of
a
spark-proof
alloy.
i
say
this,
that
if
he
comes
in
and
says
that
he
knows
the
description
of
--
i
mean,
he
knows
the
condition
of
those
wrenches,
as
of
the
date
of
this
accident,
and
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
i
would
say
that
--
i
would
say
if
he
is
describing
them
on
the
day
of
the
accident,
he'd
have
to
be
there
and
look
at
them.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i'd
have
to
say
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that
he
had
--
that
he
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right,
he
would.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
that's
right.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
say
this.
well,
what
--
what
difference
does
it
make
--
what
--
what
their
condition
is
nine
days
before?
the
--
the
question
is
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i'd
say
this,
if
he
--
if
he
is
testifying
as
to
the
condition
of
a
tool
on
a
given
day,
he
has
to
know
what
that
condition
is.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
he
must
have
some
knowledge
of
it.
and
he
is
testifying
--
he
is
testifying
of
conditions
concerning
which
he
has
known
of.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
and
that
--
let
me
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
let
me
--
pardon
me
and
because
i
--
i
say
this,
your
honor.
let's
assume
that
that
was
--
that
was
improperly
excluded,
which
i
don't
concede.
it's
the
same
type
of
testimony
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
himself
testified
to,
which
is
simply
a
general
description
of
--
of
a
wrench
being
old,
battered,
chewed
up,
beat-up
and
nothing
which
--
which
permits
a
reasonable
inference
that
there
was
anything
wrong
with
the
--
with
the
ability
of
that
tool
to
perform
the
function
for
which
it
was
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
i
would
say,
yes,
that's
what
i
say.
anymore
than
--
anymore,
your
honor,
than
--
that
if
--
if
they
should
describe
a
--
a
man
who
was
--
who
was
supposed
to
perform
a
particular
function.
let's
assume
that
his
job
was
a
mental
job
and
he
is
described
as
old
and
decrepit
and
lame..
that
doesn't
affect
his
ability
to
--
to
perform
a
mental
task.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
and
i
think
this.
that
you've
got
--
you
can't
have
a
mate
come
in
and
say
that
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
you
can't
have
a
mate
come
in
and
say,
"all
the
tools
everywhere
in
this
pumproom
are
bad
and
have
that
--
have
that
cover
this
particular
thing."
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
well,
not
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
it
was
considered
solely
as
a
vital
part,
i'm
sure,
as
a
--
mr.
lucian
y.
ray
as
a
negligence
case,
and
they
don't
(inaudible).
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
