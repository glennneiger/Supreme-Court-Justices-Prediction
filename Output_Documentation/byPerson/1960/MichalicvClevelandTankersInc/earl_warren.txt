the
man
who
gave
that
testimony

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
ray,
i
--
i
wonder
whether
--
don't
you
attach
some
significance
to
--
to
this?
it
appears
on
page

(a)
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
where
the
petitioner
testified
he
told
the
pumpman,
"this
tool
is
not
very
good,
kind
of
beat-up.
this
wrench
keeps
slipping
off."
now,
in
tying
those
two
things
together,
the
fact
that
this
--
this
tool
is
not
very
good
means,
for
the
purpose
he
has
it,
and
this
"kind
of
beat-up"
would
mean
some
material
part
of
it
and
the
fact
that
“the
wrench
keeps
slipping
off,”
aren't
those
things,
when
combined,
some
evidence
that
the
--
that
the
tool
is
not
sufficient
for
the
task?
and
the
pumpman
said,
"never
mind
about
that.
do
the
best
job
you
can."
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
in
the
record.
it's
in
the
record
and
quoted
as
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
you
rely.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
suppose
if
he
says
the
wrench
keeps
slipping
off
because
the
--
the
tool
won't
--
won't
hold
onto
the
nut,
what
--
what
more
could
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
ray
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon.
