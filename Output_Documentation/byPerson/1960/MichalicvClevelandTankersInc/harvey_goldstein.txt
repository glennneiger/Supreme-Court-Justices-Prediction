mr.
harvey
goldstein
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
court.
this
is
a
case
concerning
a
seaman
suing
under
the
provisions
of
the
jones
act
and
for
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel
upon
which
he
was
employed
under
the
general
maritime
law.
a
jury
trial
was
held
and
after
the
plaintiff's
case
was
ended,
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
was
denied
in
informal
language
by
the
trial
judge
in
saying
“let's
go
ahead”.
the
motion
for
the
directed
verdict
was
again
renewed
at
the
end
of
the
entire
case,
and
it
was
granted.
the
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
and
of
course,
we
are
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
point
in
belaboring
what
must
be
well-known
to
all
of
us,
and
that
is
that,
in
cases
of
this
type,
when
we
are
here
to
determine
whether
a
district
judge
was
correct
in
granting
a
directed
verdict
that
the
only
question
that
should
arise
to
that
district
court
judge
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
material
issue
of
fact,
upon
which,
the
jury
could
have
found
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
all
of
the
evidence,
that
is,
both
the
plaintiff's
and
in
this
particular
case,
because
the
directed
verdict
was
granted
at
the
end
of
the
entire
case,
also
the
defendant's
evidence
must
be
considered
by
the
district
judge.
that
evidence
must
also
be
considered
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff
and
in
addition,
all
inferences
which
may
be
reasonably
drawn
from
that
evidence
must
be
considered
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
the
plaintiff.
and
so,
the
situation
becomes
a
comparatively
easy
one,
and
that
is
whether
or
not,
considering
all
the
evidence
in
this
case,
there
was
a
material
issue
of
fact
which
should
have
caused
the
district
judge
to
submit
this
case
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration.
there
is
no
question
but
that
this
case
concerned
conflicting
testimony.
i
am
not
here
to
state
that
the
plaintiff
would
have
won
his
case
had
the
case
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
or
not
it
should
have
been
submitted
for
the
jury's
consideration
rather
than
the
district
judge's
consideration.
michalic
was
a
fireman.
he
had
worked
for
three
years
prior
to
the
date
of
the
accident
for
the
very,
very
same
shipping
company.
he
had
had
buerger's
disease
but
for
that
three-year
period,
he
claim
that
he
was
in
good
health,
that
he
was
able
to
work
and
in
fact,
some
of
the
defendant's
witnesses
testified
that
his
work
was
good,
that
he
completed
his
work
without
any
particular
difficulty.
in
addition,
testimony
showed
that
the
officers
of
the
vessel
knew
that
he
had
the
buerger's
disease
condition
and
that
they
employed
him
in
spite
of
that
fact
evidently
because,
and
certainly
we
could
draw
the
inference
that
he
was
a
good
workman
and
able
to
do
his
duties.
the
lay-up
period
had
just
started.
this
was
a
ship
on
the
great
lakes
and
as
your
honors
well
know,
ships
in
the
beginning
of
the
winter
season,
that
is
the
end
of
december,
are
laid
up
for
the
entire
winter
season
to
start
their
sailing
again
in
the
spring.
michalic
was
a
fireman
and
his
area
of
duty
was
in
the
fire
hole.
but
during
this
lay-up
period,
he
was
ordered
by
his
superior
officer
to
go
for
the
first
time,
he
said,
into
the
pumproom
in
order
to
help
the
pumpman
do
some
work
that
was
involved
in
the
lay-up
period.
he
went
into
the
pumproom.
he
said
that
he
was
given
a
wrench,
and
i
will
go
into
the
description
of
the
wrench
in
a
moment,
a
wrench
and
a
mallet
and
was
told
what
to
do.
the
pumpman
testified
pointblank
that
he
never
showed
michalic
how
to
do
the
work
nor
did
he
watch
him
do
the
work,
but
he
told
him
about
the
casing.
the
casing
was
the
machinery.
the
particular
pump
covering
that
was
to
be
taken
off
by
michalic
loosening
these
20
or
so
nuts
from
the
casing
itself.
michalic
stated
that
he
worked
for
about
an
hour.
that
the
pumpman
later
came
back
or
came
back
at
that
point
from
another
job
which
he
was
doing
and
that
michalic
told
and
complained
to
the
pumpman
about
the
condition
of
the
mallet
--
i'm
sorry,
about
the
condition
of
the
wrench.
and
the
pumpman
told
him,
"never
mind
that.
go
ahead
and
complete
the
job.
do
the
best
you
can,"
i
believe
were
his
exact
words.
and
michalic
did
continue
the
job
and
finally
completed
the
job.
at
that
point,
the
pumpman
came
out
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
part
of
the
testimony,
sir,
that
i
do
rely
upon.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
that's
part
of
it.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
the
fact
that
he
stated
that
the
wrench
was
battered
and
beaten,
the
fact
that
it
was
stated
that
the
wrench
is
worn,
the
fact
that
it
was
stated
that
the
wrench
was
old,
the
fact
that
the
wrench
was
stated
to
be
all-chewed
up
on
the
end
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
and
not
very
good.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
on
page
10,
i
believe,
sir,
of
the
record.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
the
petitioner's
testimony
and
one
witness
by
the
petitioner,
and
i
will
get
to
that
witness'
testimony
in
a
moment.
we
believe
that
all
of
that
descriptive
testimony
concerning
the
condition
of
the
wrench
was
sufficient
to
permit
a
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration.
may
i
point
out
the
similarity
of
the
language
used
by
the
petitioner
and
by
his
witness
to
the
language
used
in
the
jacob
case
by
this
court.
in
the
jacob
case,
in
which
this
court
stated
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
permit
submission
of
the
case
to
the
jury,
there
is
this
language
“petitioner
used
an
s-shaped
end
wrench
of
the
proper
size
which
was
“well-worn,”
had
seen
a
lot
of
service,
“was
a
loose
fit,”
had
a
lot
of
play
on
it.
“it
was
worn.”
the
play
at
the
end
was
about
an
inch.”
and
i
think
that
our
language
is
very
similar.
in
addition,
there
was
a
question
of
a
safe
place
to
work.
michalic
testified
that
in
order
to
get
down
to
the
area
of
the
pump
he
had
to
climb
down
from
a
catwalk
which
was
at
thwart
ship,
placed
the
thwart
ship
through
the
pumproom
and
“in
between
four
beams
which
held
this
pump
in
order
to
stop
it
from
vibrating
and
they
work
in
an
area
of
approximately
six
inches."
other
witnesses
testified
that
it
might
have
been
as
much
as
16
inches,
but
in
no
case
did
any
witness
testify
either
less
than
6
or
more
than
16.
in
addition
to
that,
the
defendant
put
into
evidence
three
exhibits
showing
the
entire
pumproom
area
and
certainly,
the
particular
pump
itself.
the
third
question
of
course
is
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
instruction
or,
in
fact,
any
instruction
on
the
use
of
the
method
to
be
used
by
michalic
in
taking
the
nuts
off
the
casing
and
also
whether
or
not
there
should've
been
supervision
in
asking
a
man,
concededly
inexperienced,
to
do
work
with
special
tools
which
he
had
never
done
before
and
in
an
area
which
he
had
never
worked
in
before.
we
state,
and
it
is
our
belief,
that
the
evidence
is
at
least
sufficient
to
have
submitted
this
matter
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration.
the
district
judge,
in
denying
the
case,
stated
simply
that
he
had
seen
the
area
in
which
michalic
had
to
work
from
the
pictures.
and
he
stated,
as
the
reason
for
his
conclusion
of
fact,
and
i
state
that
it
was
his
conclusion
of
fact,
that
michalic
was,
in
fact,
given
a
safe
place
to
work
was
that
“well,
the
pumpman
did
similar
work
on
another
pump.
if
he
could've
gotten
to
his
pump,
why
couldn't
michalic
get
to
his?"
of
course,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
pumps
were
in
the
same
or
in
any
similar
place
in
the
pumproom
itself.
this
was
simply
a
statement
by
a
judge
going
completely
outside
the
record
to
assume
that
two
men
were
doing
similar
work
when,
in
fact,
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
type
in
the
record
itself.
as
far
as
the
question
of
instruction
and
supervision
of
michalic,
the
judge
said,
the
district
court
judge
that
is,
said
that
this
isn't
necessary.
he
might
not
have
been
experienced,
but
experience
isn't
needed
here.
now,
i
submit
that
that
question
is,
again,
a
question
of
fact
which
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration
and
not
by
the
district
court
judge.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
with
--
with
one
minor
point,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
he
doesn't
--
he
does
not
claim
that
the
hitting
of
the
mallet
against
the
wrench
knocked
the
wrench
out
of
his
hand.
he
claims
that,
because
the
wrench
could
not
hold
against
the
nut,
it
slipped.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
he
is
holding
onto
the
wrench,
but
it
was
the
slipping
--
it
was
the
slipping
of
the
wrench
off
the
nut
itself
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
caused
the
wrench
to
slip.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
correct,
but
it
was
the
--
he
claims
that
it
was
the
slipping
of
the
wrench
off
the
nut
that
caused
the
wrench
to
slip
out
of
his
hand
not
the
mere
fact
that
he
simply
let
go
of
the
wrench.
there
is
no
claim
of
that
sort
in
the
case.
i
--
i
wish
to
make
that
distinction,
sir.
now,
in
addition
to
the
other
three
questions
as
to
whether
or
not
the
tool
was
in
fact
effective,
whether
or
not
michalic
was
given
a
safe
place
to
work,
and
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
some
instruction
and
supervision
of
the
work,
there
is
the
question
of
a
witness
and
the
witness
was
the
second
mate
aboard
the
vessel
who
testified
for
the
plaintiff.
he
was
also
the
master
of
the
vessel
the
year
after
or
two
years
after.
and
the
witness
on
direct
testimony
stated,
in
similar
terms,
his
conclusions
that
the
wrench
was
defective
in
the
sense
of
describing
the
wrench
as
beaten
and
battered
as
usual.
he
stated
that
he
knew
the
pumproom
area.
he
stated
that
he
knew
the
tools.
now,
on
direct
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no,
no
i
would
assume
on
the
side,
sir,
in
order
to
loosen
the
nuts
in
an
opening
position.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i
don't
know,
sir.
the
--
the
record
itself
doesn't
particularly
point
out
in
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
he
was.
he
was
wheeling
the
mallet.
holding
the
wrench
in
one
hand
and
wheeling
the
mallet
in
the
other.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
well
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
my
--
my
impression
of
the
--
of
the
record
was
simply,
sir,
that
he
was
holding
the
mallet
this
way
and
striking
--
holding
the
wrench
this
way
and
striking
with
the
mallet
with
his
left
hand
i
would
assume
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
--
in
an
effort
to
move
the
wrench
in
this
direction
and
loosen
the
nut.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
thank
you,
sir,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
to
continue,
the
witness
involved
was
the
second
mate
of
the
ship
involved
in
this
accident.
he
stated
that
he
knew
the
pumproom
area,
that
he
knew
the
tools,
and
that
they
were
battered
and
beaten
as
usual,
they
were
old,
and
they
were
worn,
and
that
they
had
been
in
that
condition
for
sometime.
now,
on
the
cross-examination,
one
of
the
first
questions
put
to
that
witness
was
whether
or
not
he
was
on
the
ship
on
the
date
of
the
accident
itself
and
he
stated
that
he
had
left
the
ship
some-nine
days
before.
because
he
was
not
on
the
ship
on
that
particular
day,
all
of
his
testimony
was
stricken,
although
there
was
quite
obviously
a
presumption
of
continuation
of
condition
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
the
contrary,
evidence
which
would
show
that
there
might
have
been
a
change
in
the
condition
of
the
various
tools.
now,
it
is
our
opinion
that
the
rejection
of
that
testimony,
in
it
of
itself,
was
sufficient
to
have
caused
--
to
have
called
for
a
reversal
in
this
particular
case
because
that
one
witness
who
was
of
prime
importance,
being
an
officer
of
the
vessel
itself,
and
stating
that
he
had
knowledge
of
the
tools
and
of
the
pumproom
itself
certainly
should
have
been
allowed
to
continue
and
testify
in
full
concerning
the
conditions
of
the
tools
itself.
the
fact
that
he
had
finished
his
direct
testimony
had
no
bearing
on
the
subject
because
further
testimony
could
have
been
brought
out
on
cross-examination
and
certainly,
further
testimony
could
have
been
brought
out
on
rebuttal
or
on
redirect
examination
of
the
witness.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
sir,
i
did.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
sir,
i'm
--
without
remembering
the
exact
language,
i'm
sure
i
did.
yes,
on
page
12.
i
state,
"the
court
below
apparently
and
correctly
reversed
the
trial
court's
exclusion
of
the
testimony
of
eisenbach,
who
was
the
witness."
in
so
doing,
it
seems
clear
that
petitioner
was,
even
then,
denied
the
right
of
rebuttal
testimony.
at
which
time,
perhaps,
the
court's
belief
as
the
cause
of
elation
could
have
been
established.
it's
not
the
reversal
alone
that's
so
important
to
witness,
sufficient
to
have
called
for
a
reversal
of
the
dismissal.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
i
do,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i'm
turning
to
the
page
now,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes.
sorry,
i
have
the
wrong
brief.
yes,
the
second
question,
subdivision
(a)
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
on
page
2.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no,
sir.
i
don't
state
it
in
so
many
words
but
it
is,
of
course,
raised
as
part
of
the
whole
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
submission
of
the
evidence
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration
in
the
sense
that
the
witness
itself
--
the
witness
himself
stated
or
gave
a
further
description
of
the
tool
which
was
then
rejected
in
whole
by
the
district
court.
and
as
i
said
on
page
12,
i
stated
the
question
at
length,
i
believe,
on
the
question
of
the
exclusion
of
the
testimony
of
that
particular
witness.
that
was
part
of
my
argument
in
my
petition
and
of
course,
the
question
was
raised
in
my
brief
at
this
time
and
it
was
also
raised
in
the
circuit
court.
now,
as
i
have
read
the
circuit
court's
opinion,
they
used
some
of
the
testimony
of
the
particular
witness
and
in
so
doing,
i
would
assume
that
they
must
have
considered
that
there
should
have
been
a
reversal
or
at
least
--
if
not
a
reversal,
at
least
that
the
witness'
testimony
should
have
been
accepted
by
the
district
court
in
deciding
this
--
the
question
of
as
to
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
a
directed
verdict.
however,
i
would
assume
that,
since
the
circuit
court
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal,
what
they
were
saying
in
fact
was
that
the
other,
if
any,
was
harmless.
i
suggest
of
course
that
it
was
not
harmless
but
that
this
witness
was
a
prime
witness
and
that
his
testimony
went
to
the
very,
very
core
of
the
entire
argument.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
yes,
that
is
correct,
sir.
so
that
they
relied
on
his
testimony
and
evidently
said
or
evidently
affirmed
that
it
made
no
difference
in
any
event.
i
would
assume
from
that
that
they
were
saying
that
the
striking
of
his
testimony
was
harmless.
so,
certainly,
i
don't
believe
that
it
was.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
on
page
5
(a)
--
i'm
sorry,
4
(a)
of
the
--
i
have
that
in
the
petition,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i'm
looking
at
the
petition,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
4
(a).
yes,
and
it
said
a
former
mate
and
captain
of
the
vessel
who
had
been
discharged
by
defendant
described
the
tools
as
being
in
the
pumproom,
in
december
1955,
as
being
"beaten
and
battered
condition."
they
had
very
beaten
and
battered.
and
then,
of
course,
they
referred
to
him
again
in
his
testimony
about
the
lighting
conditions
in
the
pumproom
on
5
(a),
"very
poor
in
this
lower
level
at
all
times,"
etcetera.
so
that
they
evidently
used
his
testimony
but
they
must
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
rejection
of
the
entire
testimony
was
harmless.
i
--
i
suggest
that
it
was
not
because
he
was
of
prime
concern,
prime
importance,
and
went
to
the
very,
very
core
of
the
case.
if
there
is
to
be
a
presumption
of
continuation
of
condition,
the
mere
fact
that
he
left
the
vessel
nine
days
before
could
certainly
not
strike
his
testimony
if
there
was,
in
fact,
no
evidence
that
there
was
any
change
in
the
condition
of
the
tools
or
in
the
pumproom
during
that
nine-day
period.
certainly,
his
evidence
was
entitled
to
some
way
even
though
he
was
not
on
the
vessel
the
very
moment
of
the
accident
itself,
and
that
weight
should
have
gone
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration.
now,
my
last
point,
it
seemed
evident
or
may
i
--
may
i
go
back
for
a
moment.
the
complaint
was
framed
with
the
use
of
the
word
"teeth"
in
the
wrench
--
in
the
description
of
the
wrench
in
the
--
in
the
sense
that
it
was
stated
in
the
complaint
that
the
teeth
of
the
wrench
were
defective
and
that
the
grip
of
the
wrench
was
defective.
the
circuit
court,
in
dismissing
the
case,
referred
time
after
time
to
the
teeth
of
the
wrench
and
saying
that
“the
plaintiff
has
not
proved
his
case.
he
says
that
the
teeth
of
the
wrench
are
defective
and
we
now
find
that
there
were
no
teeth
in
the
wrench.
he
claims
that
the
grip
of
the
wrench
was
defective
and
we
now
find
that
there
was
no
grip.”
there
was
no
question
but
that
there
were
no
teeth
of
the
wrench.
it
was
never
asserted
that
there
were
any
teeth
on
the
wrench,
except
in
the
complaint
itself.
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
pretrial
preparation
in
the
case
and
mr.
ray,
during
the
discussion
of
the
argument
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
judge,
conceded
that
he
was
not
surprised
in
any
way
that
there
was
no
teeth
on
the
wrench.
in
short,
the
entire
case
was
predicated
to
an
open-end
wrench
which
did
not
have
any
teeth
but
were,
in
fact,
used
by
the
plaintiff,
as
we
said,
in
a
defective
condition.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
the
wrench
was
not
produced,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
it
was
not.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
because
they
were
supposed
to
be
special
wrenches
for
the
use
of
the
pumproom
in
a
special
toolbox.
there
were
supposed
to
be
three
wrenches
for
three
particular
pumps.
all
of
these,
all
the
same.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
all
the
same.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
no,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
all
bad.
he
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
you
mean
--
i'm
sorry,
do
you
mean
the
plaintiff
complained
about
all
three?
no,
the
plaintiff
complained
only
of
the
one
that
he
--
that
he
used.
he
didn't
know
that
there
were
any
other
wrenches.
however,
the
testimony
was
that
all
the
wrenches
were
in
the
same
condition.
all
the
tools
were
in
the
same
condition,
that
they
were
all
battered
and
beaten
and
had
been
so
for
some
time.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
he
was
the
second
mate
on
the
ship
and
in
fact,
he
was
the
master
of
the
ship
or
the
--
either
the
first
mate
or
--
and
the
master
the
following
two
years
for
the
very,
very
same
defendant
on
the
same
ship.
if
i
may,
i'll
take
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
although,
of
course,
i
might
add
that
the
plaintiff
never
did
drop
his
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness,
that
was
always
in
the
case.
that
was
raised
in
the
circuit
court
briefs
and
that
has
been
raised
in
the
briefs
before
this
court.
and
certainly,
if
this
court
would
find
that
that
wrench
was
defective,
that,
in
it
of
itself,
i
believe
would
compel
a
decision
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
it
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
for
--
for
unseaworthiness.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
actually,
it
was
two
causes
of
action
though,
not
put
as
two
separate
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
causes
in
the
complaint,
but
there
was
a
statement
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
i
--
i
would
think
so.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
it
--
it
wouldn't
--
as
a
practical
matter,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
much
difference.
may
i
--
mr.
harvey
goldstein
go
through
a
certain
testimony
very
quickly.
on
the
motion
to
strike
the
witness'
testimony,
may
i
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
47
of
the
record.
mr.
ray,
“i
move
that
the
witness'
testimony
be
stricken.”
the
court,
“ladies
and
gentlemen,
everything
this
man
said
about
what
he
had
seen
on
or
about
that
day
in
his
previous
testimony,
all
of
which
relating
to
december
28th
when
this
plaintiff
was
heard
and
date
immediately
around
it
has
to
go
out,"
so
that
his
testimony
was
stricken
in
its
entirety.
whether
or
not
a
question,
perhaps,
about
his
prior
service
on
the
ship
was
stricken
is
unimportant.
the
important
thing
is
that
all
testimony
concerning
the
condition
of
the
tools
was
stricken.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
that
--
that
is
correct
and
my
claim,
of
course,
is
that
they
were
wrong
in
that
statement.
evidently,
they're
assuming
that
the
order,
if
any,
was
harmless
or
some
such
intent,
and
i
say
that
the
loss
of
further
cross-examination
and
the
loss
of
further
redirect
examination
could
have
brought
out
facts
in
this
case
which
would
have
satisfied
any
district
court
judge
if
that
man
had
been
further
allowed
to
testify.
on
page
10,
we
have
stated
of
course
that
the
tool
was
chewed
up.
now,
if
your
honors
will
see
these
two
questions
and
two
answers
on
the
top,
"can
you
describe
this
wrench?”
“it
is
about
one
foot
long.”
“was
it
an
adjustable
end
or
open-end
wrench?”
“it
was
an
open-end
wrench.
it
was
an
all
--
it
was
an
old
wrench,
all
chewed
up
on
the
end.”
now,
can
we
possibly
say
that
he
was
not
talking
about
the
jure
end
of
the
wrench?
this
isn't
a
matter
of
simply
saying,
"well,
the
wrench
was
all
chewed
up."
he
is
specifically
pointing
to
the
open-end
part
of
the
wrench
and
saying
that
the
wrench
was
all
chewed
up
on
the
end.
there
can
be
no
other
assumption
in
this
matter.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
instruction
and
supervision,
the
pumpman
himself
admittedly
--
admitted
that
he
--
that
he
showed
him
nothing
about
the
wrench.
he
told
him
nothing
about
the
job
itself.
i
direct
your
attention
to
page
72
of
the
record.
did
you
show
--
question,
“did
you
show
him
the
nuts
he
had
to
knock
off?”
answer,
“no,
i
told
him
the
casing.
there
was
only
one
pump
there
on
that
side,
centrifugal
pump.”
“when
that
--
when
that
happened,
did
he
have
to
leave
the
catwalk
and
get
down
to
a
lower
level?”
“yes,
sir.”
“did
you
watch
him
work?”
“no,
sir.”
so
that,
there
is
specific
testimony
by
the
pumpman
himself
that
he
gave
him
neither
instruction
nor
supervision.
and
certainly,
if
the
--
as
i
know
the
court
will,
when
you
read
the
district
court's
decision
--
opinion
granting
the
directed
verdict,
you
will
see
that
the
court
itself
stated
that
this
man
was
given
no
instruction
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say
“well,
of
course
he
didn't
need
instruction
because
it
was
such
a
simple
job.”
certainly,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
job
was
simple
enough
when
it
had
to
be
handled
with
special
non-sparking
tools,
hit
in
such
a
way
by
an
experienced
man
in
an
area
that
he
claims
he
had
never
been
in
before
in
his
entire
life,
was
certainly
a
question
for
the
jury.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
judge
cannel,
i
believe.
mr.
harvey
goldstein
james
cannel.
then,
on
the
question
of
safe
place
to
work,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
corridors
were,
in
fact,
too
close,
on
page
22
of
the
record.
question,
“was
there
any
catwalk
in
the
area
of
that
pump
you
talked
about?”
“yes,
sir”.
“where
was
that
located?”
“it
goes
across
the
ship.”
“but
is
it
right
over
the
casing
or
to
the
side?”
“halfway
over.
it
is
halfway
over
the
casing.”
“now,
when
you
were
taking
the
bolts
and
nuts
off,
how
many
of
those
nuts
had
you
taken
off
at
the
time
the
wrench
slipped?”
“i
had
taken
them
all
off
but
about
five
or
six.”
“you
took
those
off
without
difficulty?”
“i
had
a
hard
time
loosening
them
off.”
“but
you
got
them
off?”
“yes.”
“in
other
words,
you
put
the
wrench
on
them
and
tapped
it
with
the
mallet
and
loosen
them,
and
then
you
turned
the
nuts
off?”
answer,
“i
had
a
hard
time
taking
them
off.”
now,
whether
or
not
this
man
was
talking
about
the
tightness
of
the
nuts
or
the
closeness
of
the
corridors
is
something
that
i
cannot
state.
i
look
at
the
record
and
i
say
that,
from
this
record,
it
could
have
easily
been
inferred
that
what
he
was
talking
about
was
the
closeness
of
the
corridors
rather
than
the
hardness
of
the
nut,
and
i
suggest
that
that,
in
it
of
itself,
would
be
a
submissible
issue
to
the
jury
for
its
consideration
and
not
the
courts.
thank
you,
sir.
