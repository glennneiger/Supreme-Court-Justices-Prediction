this
is
also
written
constantly
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
--
are
those
--
is
that
all
there
is
in
the
record
regarding
lilly's
activities
in
new

on

affidavits.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
complaint,
but
just
scanning
it
faithfully
in
your
complaint,
that
says
any
--
any
of
the
--
as
any
of
the
facts
which
appear
on
those
two
affidavits,

j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on

affidavits
including
the
affidavits
of
the
defendants.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
willis,
i
--
i
don't
think
i
caught
your
answer
before.
i
know
there
are
--
i
guess
every
state
has
a
qualification
statute,
does
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
does
every
state
have
a
provision
of
this
new
jersey
statute
namely
that
you
cannot
maintain
an
action
in
its
courts
unless
you
qualified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
common
to,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
actually
i
suppose,
if
a
wholesaler
that
failed
to
pay
a
bill
and
you
tried
to
sue,
under
this
decision,
you
couldn't
sue
(voice

have
them
with
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

you
get
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doing
what,
this
is
local
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
judge
sherr
held?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
the
application
of
this
statute
required
proof
of
the
doing
of
local
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
last
question.
is
it
still
the
practice
of
only
those
questions
are
raised
which
are
briefed
before
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
appreciate
that
but
i
was
speaking
of
the
appellant
factors,
is
it
still
the
factors,
as
--
at
least
there
was
when
i
was
there
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
only
those
issues
were
raised
for
decision
in
the
supreme
court
that
were
briefed.
