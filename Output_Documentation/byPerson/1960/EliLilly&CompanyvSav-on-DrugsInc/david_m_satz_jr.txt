mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
new
jersey
intervened
in
this
case,
pursuant
to
rules
of
its
supreme
court
to
defend
the
constitutional
application
of
this
particular
statute
to
a
foreign
corporation
which
hadn't
registered
to
do
business
in
new
jersey
and
the
lower
court
prior
to
our
entering
these
proceedings,
had
held
that
it
was
doing
business
in
contravention
of
the
foreign
corporation
registration
statute.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
doing
local
business,
justice
brennan.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
i
believe
and
i
must
admit,
without
criticizing
judge
sherr
that
the
language
could
have
been
clearer
with
respect
to
the
cases
of
this
court
and
other
courts
which
have
gone
on
to
test
what
is
doing
business
by
making
a
specific
finding
of
whether
something
was
an
intra
or
interstate
commerce.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
the
statute
has
not
been
that
often
interpreted
at
least
in
recent
times.
to
give
any
standard
test,
but
usually
it
is
interpreted
to
mean
local
business,
which
was
the
fact
here.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
and
i
believe
this
court
and
i'm
saying
that
respectfully,
where
there
are
facts
in
the
record,
supporting
a
particular
result,
which
are
leading
to
a
possible
affirmance,
can
have
supporting
--
has
reaching
that
result,
any
reason.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
it
is
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
i
believe
under
new
jersey
law,
justice
brennan,
matters
particularly
applied
and
exclusively
so
to
the
appellant
seeking
a
reversal
and
i
think
under
state
(inaudible),
i
recall
correctly
a
--
a
respondent
has
allowed
to
rely
on
anything
in
the
record
to
support
affirmance
in
that
regard.
i
believe
it
is
particularly
important
to
point
out
to
this
court
what
new
jersey
does
not
do
in
the
exercise
of
its
application
to
foreign
corporations
of
this
statute,
because
i
think
that
the
opponent
yesterday
led
the
court
to
believe
that
new
jersey
wouldn't
require
a
foreign
corporation
to
register
if
it
was
merely
casually
connected
in
some
business
interest
in
new
jersey
or
that
it
is
exceeding,
that
is
the
new
jersey
legislature,
its
powers
of
requiring
certain
information
from
foreign
corporations
which
it
could
not
control
under
the
commerce
clause
or
within
its
own
constitution.
and
i
believe
the
new
jersey
courts
do
not,
in
any
way,
wish
to
control
a
foreign
corporation
by
requiring
it
to
register
in
new
jersey
if
that
company
that
has
not
registered
is
merely
suing
on
a
transaction
that
arises
out
of
interstate
commerce.
and
in
that
regard,
i
believe
it's
particularly
important
today,
using
the
same
historical
principles
from
gibbons
v.
ogden
on
down
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
pigg
case,
sioux
remedy,
furst
v.
brewster
and
so
on,
are
all
cases
which
dealt
with
the
particular
application
of
a
state
registration
statute,
which
correctly
prevented
that
state
from
requiring
a
foreign
corporation
to
register.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
i
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
--
i
believe
it
could,
justice
frankfurter.
under
pigg
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
--
and
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
not
--
that's
our
trouble,
justice
frankfurter.
we're
dealing
here
with
an
opinion,
perhaps
in
new
jersey
supreme
court,
frankly,
could've
clarified
some
of
the
problems
there.
this
was
brought
on
in
pleadings
and
i
think
a
supreme
court
decision
or
appellate
court
decision
was
expected
by
the
trial
court
when
it
wrote
its
opinion.
and
i
can't
say
that
from
the
record
nor
is
that
my
business
as
such,
but
i
believe
and
we
have
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
only
can
state
that
in
our
briefs,
the
state
of
new
jersey
as
well
as
corespondent
had
made
what
could
be
called
concessions.
i
say
they're
judicial
concessions
because
we
don't
intend
to
exceed
some
of
the
doctrines
expressed
by
the
supreme
court.
in
that
regard,
we
have
distinguished
the
pigg
case
and
those
following
them
and
we
have
a
healthy
respect
for
what
was
said
there
when
the
contact
is
casual,
which
you
pointed
out,
yourself,
in
the
union
brokerage
case.
or
whether
it
is
a
suit
directly
in
an
interstate
transaction
or
where
a
state
statute
has
exceeded
its
own
power
in
trying
to
require
information
from
a
foreign
corporation,
which
it
has
no
right
to
do.
and
in
that
regard,
we
have
tried
to
outline
in
our
brief,
exactly
what
new
jersey
has
required.
and
i
might
say
in
closing
that
this
should
be
not
called
as
has
been
called
by
courts
throughout
the
years,
a
qualification
statute.
it
should
be
called
an
identity
statute
or
a
registration
statute
that
will
merely
secure
for
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
the
state,
itself,
appropriate
information
from
a
corporation
which
admittedly
is
operating
in
that
state
and
where
the
information
that
is
sought
is
vital
to
the
state
and
in
no
way,
directly,
or
i
believe,
even
indirectly,
affects
its
right
to
do
interstate
business.
and
i
say
that
with
a
healthy
respect
for
everything
this
court
has
said
throughout
the
years.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
i
believe
that
a
--
a
contract
could
be
sued
on,
if
made
--
as
respects
its
interstate
commerce
and
i
think
the
contract
gives
right
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
we
infer
that
in
our
brief,
justice
harlan,
that
a
suit
against
a
signer
would
be
a
contract
so-called
in
interstate
commerce
and
could
be
sued
upon
without
registration.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
justice
whittaker,
it
depends
on
the
cause
of
action
in
this
particular
case
and
on
this
record
to
the
extent
that
we're
dealing
with
nonsigners,
people
that
have
no
relationship,
except
by
operation
of
the
new
jersey
fair
trade
law
with
eli
lilly.
we
have
contemplated
in
our
brief
and
have
conceded
that
if
there
is
a
contract
and
nothing
more,
in
other
words,
we
are
here
dealing
with
possible
signers
and
possible
local
commerce
in
new
jersey,
with
the
detailmen
that
are
there,
but
assuming
that
these
people
were
not
in
new
jersey,
but
there
was
a
contract
between
eli
lilly
and
indiana
and
some
retail
outlets
in
new
jersey,
then
it
would
be
like
a
--
an
action
for
the
shipment
of
goods
because
eli
lilly
has
made
that
as
part
of
its
interstate
business
and
would
not
have
to
register.
so
that
in
part
to
answer
your
specific
question,
it
might
deal
with
the
particular
cause
of
action
or
the
transaction
giving
rise
to
the
cause
of
action,
where
they
would
not
have
to
register,
but
not
under
the
record
where
the
facts
that
are
presented
to
this
court.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
justice
frankfurter,
our
rule
is
permissive.
we
are
required
to
be
given
notice
by
persons
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
it
really
doesn't
state,
your
honor.
it's
merely
a
--
a
rule
that
says
that
if
a
constitutional
question
arises,
notice
shall
be
given
in
a
court,
the
attorney
general
may
intervene.
we
were
asked
after
the
trial
court
judgment
was
entered
to
intervene
and
did
so
promptly.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
supreme
court,
and
we
filed
briefs
there
and
argued
and
then
are
here.
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
well,
ours
--
mr.
david
m.
satz,
jr.
it's
sometimes
loosely
done
because
we
don't
get
notice
every
time,
but
we
--
as
soon
as
--
we
usually
do
review
them
and
they're
being
promptly,
if
necessary.
so
for
all
of
these
foregoing
reasons
and
in
our
brief
particularly,
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
