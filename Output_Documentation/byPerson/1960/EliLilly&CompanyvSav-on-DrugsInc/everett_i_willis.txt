mr.
everett
i.
willis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
appeal
presents
a
clear
cut
question
of
constitutional
law,
whether
a
state
may
constitutionally
require
a
foreign
corporation
engaged
only
in
interstate
commerce
to
comply
with
its
qualification
statute
and
obtain
a
certificate
of
authority
from
the
state
in
order
to
transact
its
interstate
business
in
the
state
and
may
bar
the
corporation
from
access
to
its
courts
if
it
does
not
do
so.
now,
the
case
arose
in
this
way.
the
appellant,
which
is
one
of
the
country's
largest
manufacturers
of
ethical
drugs,
is
an
indiana
corporation.
it
sued
the
appellee
in
a
new
jersey
court
to
enjoin
it
from
selling
the
appellant's
trademark
products
at
prices
less
than
the
minimum
prices
established
pursuant
to
the
new
jersey
fair
trade
law
and
the
federal
mcguire
act.
the
trial
court,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
without
opinion,
granted
summary
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
appellant
was
barred
from
the
courts
of
new
jersey
for
not
having
obtained
a
certificate
of
authority
to
transact
business
in
the
state.
now,
the
business
the
appellant
transacts
in
new
jersey
is
entirely
an
interstate
commerce.
and
the
proceedings
below,
nobody
disputed
it.
the
appellant's
factories
are
in
indiana.
all
its
products
are
manufactured
there.
all
its
sales
were
made
under
contracts
entered
into
outside
new
jersey.
the
appellant
makes
no
sales
to
retailers,
only
to
wholesalers.
the
appellant
owns
no
property,
leases
no
property
in
new
jersey,
has
no
warehouse,
no
stock
of
goods
in
new
jersey.
indeed,
the
only
activities
of
any
kind,
in
new
jersey
consist
of
promotional
and
informational
activities
by
employees
who
neither
solicit
nor
accept
any
orders
from
anyone.
there's
a
district
manager
who
leases
an
office
for
the
expense
of
which
he
is
reimbursed
by
the
appellant.
he
supervises
18
highly
trained
detailmen
who
call
on
physicians,
hospitals
and
pharmacists
to
acquaint
them
with
these
drugs,
their
ingredients,
their
therapeutic
properties
and
promote
the
lilly
name
and
the
use
of
its
products.
they
distribute
some
free
advertising
and
promotional
literature.
occasionally,
as
a
service
to
a
retailer,
they
may
transmit
an
order
for
him
to
a
wholesaler
who
may
fill
it
or
not,
as
he
pleases.
basically,
these
detailmen
are
missionaries
whose
function
it
is,
to
promote
the
lilly
name
and
products,
try
to
increase
the
demand
for
them
by
physicians,
hospitals
and
pharmacists
so
that
more
orders
will
flow
from
the
wholesalers
to
the
factories
in
indiana.
now,
until
this
case,
new
jersey
recognized
that
it
could
not
constitutionally
apply
its
qualification
statute
to
interstate
commerce.
the
right
to
do
interstate
commerce
being
a
federal
right,
not
one
to
be
granted,
denied
or
conditioned
by
the
state.
every
other
state
in
the
union,
which
has
addressed
itself
to
the
problem,
either
through
its
legislature
or
its
courts,
and
there
are
47
of
them,
has
recognized
the
constitutional
limitation.
the
classic
decision
of
this
court
on
the
subject
is,
of
course,
international
textbook
company
against
pigg,
which
has
been
followed
again
and
again.
now,
the
court
below
did
not
seriously
suggest
that
if
the
pigg
case
and
the
other
qualification
statutes
cases
that
have
followed
it
are
still
law,
new
jersey
would
be
able
to
apply
its
qualification
statute
to
this
appellant.
it
didn't
suggest
that
the
pigg
line
of
cases
has
ever
been
overruled
or
assert
that
this
court
has
ever
upheld
a
qualification
statute
as
applied
to
interstate
commerce
for
it
never
has
in
its
history.
what
the
court
said
was
that
it
thought
it
saw
in
some
recent
decisions
of
this
court
a
new
trend,
a
new
philosophy
about
interstate
commerce.
but
the
only
case
it
cited
as
an
illustration
of
a
new
philosophy
was
the
recent
tax
decision
in
northwest
portland
cement.
now,
northwest
portland
cement
recognized
the
continued
vitality
of
the
basic
principle
of
the
pigg
line
of
cases
which
is
that
a
state
cannot
impose
conditions
upon
the
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce
because
that
is
outside
the
constitutional
fit
stair
of
the
state.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
the
appellees
have
raised
on
this
appeal
for
the
first
time,
a
new
argument
that
the
--
that
eli
lilly
is
partly
engaged
in
intrastate
commerce.
now,
they
based
on
the
cheney
case
that
came
to
this
court
many
years
ago
from
massachusetts,
which
nobody
even
mentioned
below
because
the
whole
argument
below
was
on
the
assumption
and
the
premise
that
it
was
entirely
interstate
commerce
and
the
question
was
whether
it
was
constitutional.
now,
we
--
we
contend
--
that
that
question
comes
too
late,
is
not
before
the
court.
the
appellees
do
not
deny
that
it's
a
new
argument
on
this
appeal.
they
seek
to
excuse
it
by
arguing
that
when
seeking
affirmance,
rather
than
reversal,
you
may
raise
new
arguments.
but
we've
cited
the
cases
that
there
is
no
such
rule
on
appeals
from
state
courts
and
--
but
--
but
furthermore,
there
is
no
support
in
--
in
the
record
for
their
--
for
their
contention
in
any
event,
as
we
have
shown
in
our
brief.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
i
say
that
the
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
my
position
is
that
--
that
they
cannot
try
the
case
below
on
the
theory
that
it
were
all
an
interstate
commerce
and
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
there
was
a
--
a
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
summary
judgment
was
granted,
dismissing
the
complaint.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
it's
the
(voice
overlap)
no,
the
--
the
appellee
sav-on-drugs,
yes.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
there
were
--
there
were
affidavits
submitted
as
is
the
usual
practice
on
--
in
--
in
support
of
it,
in
our
position
to
the
summary
judgment
which
spell
out
exactly
what
--
what
we
do
in
new
jersey.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
none,
none.
these
men,
they're
trained
pharmacists
and
they
go
around
to
the
physicians
and
hospitals
and
pharmacists
and
can
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
they're
--
they're
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
that
--
the
doctors
--
the
doctors
prescribed
them
and
the
hospitals
use
them,
the
pharmacists
sell
them.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
sick
people
are
--
sick
people
are,
yes.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
they
call
on
them
and
--
and
explain
the
products
to
them,
what
they
will
do,
what
their
ingredients,
what
disease
they're
indicated
for,
what
the
--
that
--
directions
for
use
and
--
and
of
course,
how
wonderful
lilly
products
are,
what
they
will
do
for
disease.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
as
i
mentioned,
they
--
they
do
distribute
some
advertising
literature,
promotional
literature.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
and
then
the
other
thing
i
mentioned
was
that
occasionally,
as
a
service
to
a
retailer,
they
will
transmit
an
order
to
a
wholesaler
which
he
may
fill
or
not
as
he
chooses.
now,
the
--
that's
where
the
appellees
on
this
appeal
bring
in
the
cheney
case.
now,
the
--
the
cheney
case
of
course,
was
a
tax
case,
but
its
--
its
facts
also
were
vastly
different.
now,
the
state
court
in
massachusetts,
this
came
from
massachusetts
and
that
court
found
that
the
company
involved
there
happened
to
be
the
northwestern
consolidated
milling
company,
had
actually
qualified
to
do
a
local
business
in
massachusetts.
it
had
an
office
where
orders
were
received
and
accepted.
it
had
a
stock
of
goods
from
which
some
sales
were
made.
and
then
it
was
found
that
a
major
part
of
its
business
consisted
of
furnishing
salesmen
to
actually
and
regularly
act
as
agents
for
local
wholesalers
in
the
aggressive
solicitation
of
business
for
the
wholesalers
who
would
then
fill
it
and
get
it
paid.
now,
the
appellees
cease
on
the
circumstance
here
to
try
to
assimilate
that
to
the
cheney
case,
which
was
never
mentioned
below,
namely,
the
occasional
courtesy
transmissions
of
an
order
for
a
retailer
which
is
not
part
of
the
mainstream
or
their
regular
job.
now,
on
portland
--
northwest
portland
cement,
it
had
been
found
and
it's
recited
in
this
court's
opinion,
that
the
company
involved
there
furnished
salesmen
--
had
salesmen
in
the
state
taking
orders
from
retailers
and
turning
them
over
to
retailers,
actually
soliciting.
it's
not
like
ours,
it's
not
just
the
occasional
transmission
service
to
a
retailer,
but
an
act
--
regular
active
solicitation
and
the
court
found
that
was
entirely
interstate
commerce
and
this
court
so
found
and
it
had
this
so
find
because
it
held
that
that
corporation
was
subject
to
a
net
income
tax
which
by
his
terms,
didn't
apply
unless
the
corporation
was
solely
an
interstate
commerce.
so
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
--
you
have
cheney
up
here
with
an
awful
lot
of
intrastate
activity.
portland
cement
with
a
little
less,
but
still
far
more
than
this
occasional
thing
we
did
and
so
i
don't
see,
first,
how
the
point
can
be
raised
here,
not
having
been
raised
below
and
--
and
secondly,
how
--
how
it
can
apply.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
then
there
is
a
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
a
--
an
affidavit
on
27
of
mr.
clutter.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes.
the
--
the
motion
was
granted
on
--
on
the
complaint
and
on
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
--
on
those
affidavits
and
some
affidavits,
two
affidavits
were
submitted
in
support
of
the
motion
which
are
on
23
and
24.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
i
think
the
affidavits
state
the
case.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
scherer
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
i
think
you
use
--
you
see
that
throughout
the
whole
--
whole
assumption
as
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
i
think
he's
--
i
think
he's
saying
that
the
fact
that
we're
engaged
solely
in
interstate
commerce
doesn't
--
doesn't
eliminate
the
state's
power.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes.
but
now,
if
i
may
say,
he
--
of
course,
there's
been
more
bad
analysis
in
the
interstate
commerce
field
in
any
place
and
i
--
i
think
we
had
a
contribution
toward
here,
because
the
--
the
court
confused
two
lines
of
cases.
now,
these
qualification
statutes
that
never
been
one
upheld
going
to
interstate
commerce.
and
they
have
been
regarded
as
falling
in
an
entirely
different
category
from
a
statute
which
basically
regulates
a
local
matter
even
though
it
affects
interstate
commerce
and
of
course
nearly
all
state
regulations
have
some
effect
on
interstate
commerce,
but
the
first
question
is,
what
is
it
you're
regulating?
and
if
you're
regulating
health
or
safety
or
highways
or
keeping
out
disease
cattle
or
adulterated
food
or
something
like
that,
then
it
is
a
local
matter
and
if
the
effect
on
interstate
commerce
isn't
too
burdensome
or
discriminatory,
it's
alright.
but
where
the
state
lays
its
heavy
hand
right
on
the
--
right
to
do
interstate
commerce
which
is
the
--
which
is
the
case
here,
there's
simply
a
basic
lack
of
power.
and
in
the
portland
cement
case,
which
upheld
in
that
income
tax,
they
pointed
out
--
the
court
--
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
reason
that
tax
was
valid
and
the
connecticut
tax
involved
in
the
earlier
spector
case
was
invalid,
was
because
the
spector
case
was
on
the
right
to
do
interstate
commerce.
and
that
being
the
incidence
of
the
tax,
you
reach
no
question
of
--
of
burden
or
--
or
balancing
of
interests,
it's
simply
a
departure
from
the
state's
constitutional
sphere.
now,
the
appellees
argued
here
that
the
test
of
constitutionality
is
a
balancing
of
the
interest,
the
need
of
the
state
for
the
statute
against
the
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
now,
we
meet
that
because
we
think
the
need
does
not
exist
and
that
there
is
a
definite
burden,
but
our
primary
point
is
that
there's
simply
no
power
and
you
don't
reach
that
point.
now,
taking
it,
however,
because
taking
the
appellees'
approach
to
it,
the
state
really
has
no
need
to
apply
this
statute
to
interstate
commerce.
this
is
a
statute
which
dates
from
1894
and
what
was
its
purpose?
we
don't
have
to
guess
at
it
because
the
new
jersey
courts
have
ruled
on
it.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
obtain,
require
the
agent
for
service
in
the
state
and
obtain
jurisdiction
in
suits
against
foreign
corporations.
now,
that
wasn't
as
easy
in
those
days
as
it
is
now.
there
were
still
vestiges
of
theories
about
a
corporation
not
existing
outside
its
home
state
and
not
being
able
to
be
sued
without
its
consent.
but
now,
we
live
in
the
days
of
the
international
shoe
decision
and
the
mcgee
decision
and
it's
perfectly
simple
to
get
jurisdiction
over
foreign
corporations
without
any
such
statute.
all
it
takes
is
minimum
contacts
within
the
bounds
of
fair
play.
now,
the
appellees
don't
--
don't
assert
that
this
statute
is
needed
to
get
jurisdiction.
they
realized
under
new
jersey
law,
you
can
serve
whoever
you
can
find.
if
you
can't
find
anybody,
you
send
a
registered
letter
to
the
home
office
and
you're
in.
they've
devised
a
new
theory
that
this
statute
is
nevertheless
quite
useful
for
the
state
in
supplying
information
as
to
the
company's
charter
powers
and
possible
tax
liability
and
--
and
the
lawfulness
of
its
activities
and
so
on.
but
now,
there
are
basic
difficulties
of
that
argument.
in
the
first
place,
it's
simply
is
not
the
purpose
for
which
the
statute
was
enacted.
it's
just
a
--
a
usefulness
that
counsel
have
found
in
court
and
secondly,
it
is
an
argument
that
would've
been
just
as
applicable
in
the
pigg
case
and
all
the
other
cases
that
have
stricken
down
these
qualification
statutes
to
supply
the
interstate
commerce,
because
they
all
follow
the
same
path.
and
so,
there
--
there
simply
isn't
any
need
for
the
statute
for
the
sole
purpose
for
which
it
was
enacted.
burden?
yes,
there
is
a
--
a
definite
deterrent
to
interstate
commerce
in
it,
in
several
ways.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
my
--
my
primary
position
of
course,
is
that
you
do
not
reach
that,
that
this
--
this
statute
as
applied
to
a
company
only
in
interstate
commerce
since
it
says,
you
cannot
do
your
interstate
commerce
here,
unless
you
do
a,
b
and
c
and
get
a
certificate
from
us
telling
you,
you
can't.
that
ends
it.
now,
i
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
and
i
--
i'm
arguing
the
constitutional
question
that
the
court
below
decided
at
the
moment.
now,
so
that
if
you
take,
however,
i
--
i'm
taking
my
opponent's
opposite
theory
that
--
that
they
--
they
elide
the
lack
of
power
and
say
it's
balanced
the
interest
as
you
do
on
a
--
in
a
statute
limiting
the
weight
and
with
trucks
or
the
length
of
trains
and
so
on.
and
i'm
--
i'm
taking
it
that
way
and
i'm
saying
that
--
that
even
in
those,
even
in
the
statutes
which
regulate
local
matters
and
then
the
test
is
--
is
burdens
on
this
and
you
do
balance
the
interest,
then
what
do
you
do?
then
you
got
to
find
there's
a
need
of
the
state,
because
if
other
means
are
available,
the
dean
milk
case
tells
us
they
must
be
used.
now,
so
on
--
that's
the
reason
i'm
developing
then,
even
on
their
approach,
there
is
no
need
and
there
is
a
burden
as
i
started
to
say
for
these
reasons,
at
least.
take
litigation,
broad
is
the
minimum
contacts
rule
is,
it
still
is
--
is
limited
to
the
balance
of
fair
play
and
there
still
are
some
suits
that
could
not
necessarily
be
brought
against
foreign
corporations,
if
they
do
not
consent.
as
for
example,
suits
by
nonresidents
on
--
on
causes
of
action
arising
outside
the
state.
now,
if
we
consent,
if
we
appoint
an
agent
to
receive
service
from
all
commerce,
we'll
be
subject
to
those
two,
fair
play
or
no
fair
play.
this
court
ruled
that,
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
mitchell
furniture
case
and
new
jersey
has
--
has
so
held.
now,
take
taxation.
these
qualification
statutes
can
be
made
to
pretext
for
taxation
and
new
jersey
does
it
in
a
loud
voice,
because
the
tax
regulation
in
new
jersey
is
cited
by
the
appellees
in
their
brief
and
the
tax
regulation
says
in
black
and
white,
"that
holding
a
certificate
of
authority
from
new
jersey
without
more,
without
anything
else,
gives
rise
to
taxable
status."
now,
the
appellees
say,
well
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
on
the
facts
here.
we
could
tax
this
company
anyway.
well,
that's
another
lawsuit
and
i
won't
try
--
to
try
it
here.
i
might
say
that
the
tax
statute
of
new
jersey
is
clearly
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business,
so
i
don't
know
how
they
get
around
the
--
the
spector
case.
but
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
a
qualification
statute,
sir?
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes
sir.
they're
very
--
they're
very
common.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
they're
very
common,
but
as
i
--
i
said
at
the
outset,
most
of
the
statutes
make
it
very
clear
that
they
only
apply
to
an
intrastate
business
and
by
an
intrastate
business,
i
mean
something
that
constitutes
commercial
transactions
that
are
economically
distinct
from
the
interstate
sale.
it's
not
all
state
activity
that
constitutes
a
local
business.
most
of
them
--
most
of
the
statutes
on
their
face
make
it
clear
they
can
find
the
intrastate
and
--
when
they
don't
do
it
by
statute,
the
--
the
courts
have
so
held
in
47
states,
every
state
that
is
ruled
on
it
and
new
jersey
until
this
case,
so
held.
so
there
is
--
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
deterrent
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
a
businessman
deciding
whether
to
go
in
and
do
business
in
new
jersey,
he's
asked
to
stick
his
head
in
the
news
that
says
he
sees
staring
him
additional
litigation,
he
wouldn't
otherwise
be
subject
to,
he
sees
a
tax
regulations,
says
he
puts
his
head
in
that
news.
he
bears
the
tax
and
that
has
a
deterrent
effect
on
interstate
commerce
and
it's
not
just
new
jersey
and
it's
not
just
this
appellant.
if
new
jersey
succeeds
in
this
effort,
the
green
light
is
on
and
it's
not
going
unnoticed
very
long
and
it
won't
be
very
long
before
every
foreign
corporation
doing
an
interstate
business
will
have
50
different
and
recurring
sets
of
requirements
to
deal
with.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
i
think,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
that
everyone
but
it
--
it's
not
an
uncommon
provision
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
--
and
--
and
of
course
that
it's
come
to
this
court,
that
was
furst
against
brewster,
it
was
the
pigg
case.
it
was
sioux
remedy
against
cope,
it
was
dahnke-walker
against
bondurant
and
--
and
the
state
courts
dismissed
these
suits
for
failure
to
qualify
and
this
court
has
always
said,
you
cannot
do
it.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
some
of
them
--
some
of
the
cases
have
involved
a
suit
to
recover
the
purchase
price,
buck
stove
against
vickers
was
a
suit
set
aside,
a
--
a
fraudulent
complaint
--
advance.
now
this
--
this
suit
is
a
suit
to
protect
the
goodwill
so
this
court
ruled
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
"protect
the
goodwill
incident
to
its
interstate
commerce."
mr.
everett
i.
willis
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
the
suit
doesn't
--
doesn't
set
the
price.
they're
--
they're
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
it's
to
enforce
the
rights
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
suit
is
to
--
to
enjoin
sales
below
the
prices
that
the
appellant
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
and
--
and
that
now
i
might
say
that
i
think
eight
states
have
the
same
question.
and
it
has
been
argued
that
because
--
that
because
the
nature
of
the
suit,
it
was
different,
everyone
except
new
jersey
has
held
that
that's
a
part
of
--
of
the
interstate
commerce
and
it's
designed
to
protect
the
goodwill
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
the
fair
trade,
it
was
recognized
--
the
fair
--
the
fair
--
state
fair
trade
laws
couldn't
become
effective
without
a
federal
law
and
that's
why
the
united
states
congress
passed
the
mcguire
act.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
that's
right.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
that's
right.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
no.
no,
that's
alright.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
sir.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
that's
right.
we
can't
--
we're
barred.
we're
out,
according
to
this
decision.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
it's
--
it's
completely
contrary
to
them.
those
are
--
those
follow
the
pigg
case.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
the
particular
thing
the
suit
was
brought
for
was
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
no,
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
sir?
mr.
everett
i.
willis
i
--
i'm
sorry.
i
just
don't
--
i
don't
follow
your
question.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
you
--
you're
sending
out
that
new
jersey
has
no
fair
trade
law.
is
that
--
yes
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
they
don't
have
to
have
the
law
but
once
they
have
it,
they
can't
discriminate
between
their
--
let
their
local
businesses
sue
and
not
let
an
interstate
--
a
foreign
corporation
interstate
commerce
suit.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
i
--
i
say
that
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
in
the
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well,
i
don't
think
it
does,
but
i
--
but
in
the
--
in
calvert
brothers
against
schwegmann,
when
the
miller-tydings
act
had
--
had
not
specifically
said
that
a
fair
trade
suit
could
be
brought
against
the
so-called
non-signer,
this
court
held
that
such
an
action
would
violate
the
antitrust
laws
and
of
course,
it
was
said,
"oh,
this
is
just
retail
sales.
this
is
just
intrastate
commerce."
and
the
court
said,
“no,
this
is
a
nationwide
pattern,
this
is
a
part
of
the
interstate
commerce.
this
is
part
of
a
whole
fabric."
and
that
--
and
that's
what
all
the
fair
trade
cases
in
the
state
courts
have
said.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
oh,
yes.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes,
sir.
now
may
i
--
may
i
comment
on
--
on
that
and
particularly
on
union
brokerage
against
jensen
which
you
mentioned.
in
union
brokerage
against
jensen,
the
brokerage
company
did
not
itself,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
have
anything
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
importation
or
exportation
of
articles
of
commerce.
it
was
rendering
a
personal
service
business,
it
had
its
office
in
minnesota,
100%
of
its
business,
commercial
transactions
were
carried
out
there.
it
was
nothing
new,
california
and
thompson
had
upheld
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
it
had
a
--
it
had
a
relation
but
--
but
the
company's
business
was
localized.
it
was
intrastate.
now,
the
eli
lilly
company's
business,
the
only
thing
we
do,
our
detailmen
promote
the
product,
promote
our
name,
basically
that's
advertising.
now,
if
an
interstate
business
became
intrastate,
because
the
interstate
seller
advertised
to
the
retail
trade
or
--
or
to
the
consuming
public,
what
would
be
left
of
interstate
commerce?
that's
not
a
local
business.
that
--
that's
not
a
--
the
--
the
sole
purpose
and
significance
of
the
promotion
relates
to
the
interstate
sales.
we're
not
in
the
advertising
business
or
the
promotion
business
in
new
jersey,
just
the
drug
business
and
it's
--
it's
an
interstate
business,
quite
different
from
union
brokerage.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
well
of
course
that
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
that's
raised
a
different
question
--
mr.
everett
i.
willis
yes.
because
--
because
and
the
--
and
this
statute
says
you
shall
not
transact
any
business
without
first
doing
a,
b,
c
and
d.
mr.
everett
i.
willis
we
can't
--
we
couldn't
sue
the
fellow
who
--
according
to
this
decision,
we
couldn't
sue
the
fellow
who
has
truck
run
over
us
and
grant
--
destroyed
the
million
dollars
worth
of
trucks.
we
just
--
we're
out,
but
how
--
how
do
we
carry
on
an
interstate
business
that
way?
i
--
i
think
the
--
the
courts
never
deviated
from
this
principle
and
the
business
community
has
relied
on
it
for
half
a
century
and
it
certainly
ought
not
to
be
changed
now
without
a
showing
of
the
most
compelling
need
and
--
and
none
at
all
has
been
shown.
