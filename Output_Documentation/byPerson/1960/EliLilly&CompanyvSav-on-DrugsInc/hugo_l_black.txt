more
than
that,
isn't

justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
far
more
than
that,
isn't
it?
it's
a
suit
to
fix
the
price
at
which
retail
goods
will
be
sold
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
that's
what
it's
for,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
reach
the
price
of
retail
sales
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
justice
hugo
l.
black
retail
sales
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
after
your
goods
have
been
bought
by
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
much
part
of
interstate
commerce
is
it
when
a
druggist
is
to
sell
a
dime
and
brought
the
goods
to
a
citizen
who
lives
in
the
next
block.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
about
a
state
not
having
power,
suppose
--
suppose
this
company
did
business
in
new
jersey
and
they
made
it
against
the
law
to
sell
goods
that
way.
wouldn't
the
state
of
new
jersey
have
a
right
to
say,
you
can't
and
nobody
else
can
file
a
suit
to
recover
on
such
a
judgment
or
on
such
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
new
jersey
made
it
against
the
law
and
report
such
a
grievance
in
--
in
its
--
within
its
county
or
state,
would
it
be
barred
by
any
constitutional
provision
from
saying
that
lilly
or
anyone
else
couldn't
--
couldn't
sue
to
enforce
a
claim
which
was
illegal?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i'm
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
a
different
question,
of
course.
but
why
do
you
say
that
this
suit
is
only
about
interstate
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
it
goes
right
into
the
heart
of
the
state
--
states
business.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
that
doesn't
affect
your
--
your
constitutional
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
--
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
to
read
two
questions.
your
--
your
--
the
first
one
is
whether
in
fact,
your
supreme
court
adopting
judge
scherer's
opinion,
properly
found
or
whether
that
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
for
which
this
appeal
has
taken,
rested
on
the
proposition
that
you're
a
foreign
corporation,
therefore,
you
must
get
a
license
from
the
state
to
go
into
its
court
and
it
is
a
matter
of
irrelevance
that
you're
a
foreign
corporation
that
does
exclusively
interstate
business,
whether
that's
what
the
judgment
rests
on.
because
that's
the
decision
of
the
court
and
secondly,
which
is
a
very
different
question,
whether
the
particular
requirement
relating
to
particular
transactions
allows
the
state
to
make
the
requirement,
to
submit
--
have
you
submit
to
its
regulations
with
reference
to
the
particular
subject
matter
although
you're
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce,
namely,
whether
your
situation
calls
within
the
jensen
case,
which
--
the
union
brokerage
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
justice
brennan
says,
you
can't
sue
in
jersey,
a
fellow
who
owes
you
a
bill
of
goods
which
you
delivered
in
new
york.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
please?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
have
any
--
as
the
record
show
--
or
do
you
know
whether
you
have
people
who
are
not
representing
an
out-of-state
company
as
this
--
18-member,
who
simply
live
in
new
jersey
and
aid
retailers
to
buy
goods
from
wholesalers,
you
have
any
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
--
suppose
these
people
were
not
employed
by
lilly,
but
were
simply
doing
this
precise
thing
and
employed
by
somebody
else
to
have
retailers
in
new
jersey
by
goods
from
wholesalers
in
new
jersey,
would
that
be
interstate
or
intrastate
business?
