justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
sir?
is
it
conceded
here,
as
it
was
there,
that
there
is
no
local
commerce
involved,
that
this
is
exclusively
interstate
commerce
that's
been
done
by
eli
lilly?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
right.
in
--
in
the
cement
case,
minnesota
supreme
court
had
expressedly
found
that
the
commerce
involved
was
exclusively
interstate
in
character
and
so
it
was
true
in
stock
and
vows,
the
same
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
it
is.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
will
find
--
go
ahead.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
wouldn't
it
be
for
new
jersey
to
say
whether
or
not,
they
ought
to
have
it
that
is
whether
there's
a
reason
for
it,
is
that
for
us
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
it's
--
if
it's
interstate
commerce.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
sure.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
on
pigg
case
it
say
just
what
you've
said
as
to
why
the
actions
to
recover
on
a
debt,
to
prevent
windfall.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
how
did
that
square
with
sioux
remedy
and
bondurant,
dahnke-walker,
cases
like
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
they're
on
the
basis
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
action
is
one
to
recover
upon
debt
and
those
there
might
be
and
--
and
(inaudible)
prevent
opening
reports
to
business
unlawfully
done
in
the
state,
this
is
not
such
a
case.
this
is
to
recover
on
a
debt.
it's
all
that
we
used
in
commerce,
is
not
--
is
not
that
the
basis
of
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
what's
the
difference
(inaudible)
of
the
power
under
the
commerce
clause?
does
that
depend
on
what
the
cause
of
the
action
is?
