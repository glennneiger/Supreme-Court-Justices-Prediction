justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
i
don't
quite
follow.
you
mean
to
say
that
counsel
obtained
a
judgment
for
those
who
can't
pick
up
new
arguments
when
they
get
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can't
pick
up
new
facts,
so
they
can't
pick
up
big
stuff
out
of
the
record
contrary
to
either
the
findings
or
assumptions
of
judgment
below
that
i
understand,
but
they
could
make
new
arguments
can
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
added
something,
i
quite
understand
it.
that's
not
a
new
argument.
that's
a
new
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
thing
to
say,
the
--
what
if
--
how
are
these
case
tried
as
they
say
it
were?
justice
felix
frankfurter
leading,
what
comes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
did
they
--
did
the
--
the
state
move
or
you
move?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
did
they
--
did
they
set
forth
facts
from
which
only
one
deduction
can
be
made
with
--
with
namely
lillys
are
engaged
entirely
in
interstate
commerce?
well
did
you
try?
how
are
we
--
how
am
i
to
find
out
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
whittaker's
question
is
to
be
answered
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
you
explicitly
in
term
say,
your
entirely
engagement
interstate
commerce?
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
disavowed
being
engaging
over
commerce?
i
mean
is
the
record
dubious
than
on
that
subject?
in
the
cement
case
as
justice
whittaker
indicated,
they
are
findings,
they're
specific
findings
as
my
recollection
was,
i
think
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
--
i
have
justice
stewart's
(inaudible)
because
look
at
the
first
paragraph.
they
did
contend
that
it's
accepted
from
any
requirement
that
apply
in
foreign
corporation
provisions
of
our
corporation,
because
it
is
engaged
entirely
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
he
gone
on
and
said
despite
that,
but
he
doesn't
go
on
and
say
that,
what
does
he
say?
not
all
state
regulations
affecting
foreign
corporations
constitute
a
burden
upon
interstate
commerce,
which
is
a
very
different
sentence
for
the
opening
paragraph,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
difficulty
is
he's
saying
that
in
the
first
paragraph,
but
not
in
the
first
sentence
in
the
second
paragraph.
just
forget
it.
and
then
--
then
again
what
he
refers
to
the
recent
trend
and
over
on
page
39,
the
trend
and
philosophy
of
the
more
recent
cases
has
been
in
favor
of
upholding
rather
than
striking
down
reasonable
state
regulations
of
foreign
corporations,
then
he
refers
to
cement
and
that
company
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it's
--
the
new
jersey
decision
from
which
you
are
appealing
here,
doesn't
rest
on
the
nature
of
the
suit,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
say
that
in
is
much
that
sales
are
made
in
this
state,
we
would
enforce
this
or
they
couldn't
in
view
of
the
mcguire
act,
could
they?
that
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
would
turn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
case
that
would
turn
on
the
subject
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
have
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
concededly,
the
business
was
entirely
foreign
commerce,
but
this
court
sustained
that
particular
regulation
because
although
exclusively
engaged
in
foreign
commerce,
it
had
local
incidences.
and
as
to
those
local
incidences,
the
particular
regulations
were
relevant.
and
you
have
to
establish
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
both
though.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
that's
all
--
that
the
court
decided
what
you
think
it
decided
and
secondly,
assuming
that
it
is
an
exclusively
foreign
commerce
doing
business
corporation,
nevertheless,
it's
the
kind
of
protection
of
local
interest
that
it's
consonant
with
the
commerce
clause
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
an
adjunct
to
exclusively
foreign
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they
--
if
they're
required
you
--
if
new
jersey
had
to
be
a
statute,
say,
you
must
disclose
the
name
of
your
resident
agent.
you
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
find
it
difficult
--
you
wouldn't
oppose
that,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
that's
raised
a
different
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
related
to
a
specific
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
say
doing
intrastate
business
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
doesn't
say
intrastate,
it
says
every
interstate
commerce
business
does
business
in
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i've
read
it
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
more
reading
doesn't
clarify
the
obscurity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
next
sentence
doesn't
--
next
sentence
looks
isn't
the
same
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
yourself,
slip
from
doing
an
intrastate
business
to
intrastate
activity,
which
are
different
things
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
constitutional
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
let
me
say
so,
you
--
you
can't
call
it
what
you
will
for
purposes
of
an
argument
of
constitutional
law.
exclusively
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
is
one
thing.
and
a
business
that
is
exclusively
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
must
necessarily
be
engaged
in
local
activities.
but
a
business
that
is
also
engaged
in
local
commerce
is
another
thing
and
if
this
business
is
a
local
commerce
concern,
then
there's
no
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
don't
need
a
new
trend
if
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
that,
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
don't
need
a
new
trend.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
can't
you
save
time
by
--
by
submitting
to
the
fact
that
this
court
has
to
accept
the
fact
that
your
court
has
applied
this
statute
to
lilly.
that's
not
--
that
question
isn't
open
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
not
that
it
could,
but
what
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
solicit
any
business
from
druggists
or
from
doctors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
they
--
do
they
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
--
do
they
sell,
is
that
too
vague
a
term,
to
sell,
do
you
sell
to
any
druggist
or
to
any
drugstore?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
solicit
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
mean
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
immediately
--
i
don't
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
case
was
decided
on
affidavits
does
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
does
either
affidavit,
well,
you
--
your
affidavit
say
that
they
solicited
any
business,
any
order,
not
they
took
a
piece
of
paper
which
they
then
transferred
to
the
wholesaler
in
new
jersey,
but
the
day
as
for
business
or
is
that
too
vague
a
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
whenever
a
state
has
power
to
tax
activities
of
an
enterprise
engaged
wholly
in
interstate
commerce,
but
part
of
that
enterprise
place
activities
in
the
state
and
that
a
state
can,
by
an
appropriate
formula,
tax
in
relation
to
those
activities
that
the
right
to
tax
an
aspect
locally
performed
within
a
state
that
thereby,
a
state
can
exact
that
corporation
to
submit
to
all
the
regulations
of
a
foreign
corporation.
you
think
those
are
equitable
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
legal
propositions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wholly
a
part
from
the
adverse
comments
that
that
decision
in
particular,
the
opinion
had
received.
that
also
was
a
question
of
what
is
taxable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
say
because
a
state
can
tax,
that
therefore,
it
can
do
anything
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
can
do
this,
because
it
can
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
said
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
what
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
relevance
of
the
tax
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
lilly
has
--
can
you
--
can
you
exact
license
taxes
from
its
drummers?
suppose
lilly
merely
because
it
has
18
or
28
drummers
soliciting
business
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
has
--
does
nothing
else,
except
in
all
the
--
the
orders
go
out
to
indiana
or
wherever
they
go,
can
you
therefore,
license
those
drummers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
another
tax
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh
i'm
suggesting
that
you
can
--
you
can
say
it
because
you
can
tax
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
therefore,
you
can
compel
submission
as
a
foreign
corporation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
very
fellows,
who
show
drugstores
or
doctors
how
to
use
this
medicine
or
pills
or
whatnot,
i
know
they're
very
expensive,
the
only
thing
i
do
know
about
them,
these
fellows
who
do
that
couldn't
be
licensed
for
that
activity
could
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
customers
the
importers
of
union
brokerage
company
could
have
been
inquired
to
be
licensed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
--
they
were
a
brokerage
concern
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
people
who
did
the
importing,
with
reference
to
its
union
brokerage
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
the
importers,
could
they
be
--
could
they
be
licensed
as
we
sustained
that
union
brokerage
company
could
be
licensed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
i'm
saying
is
i'm
--
i
happen
to
pick
that
was
a
sound
decision
mr.
lane,
but
that
was
one
stage
removed.
union
brokerage
company,
all
its
business
was
exclusively
within
minnesota
and
therefore,
it
had
relations
to
the
minnesota
population.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
--
do
i
--
am
i
entitled
to
infer
from
what
you
said
that
this
requirement
of
registration
or
this
would
not
preclude
the
corporation
engaged
entirely
in
interstate
commerce
and
sue
on
an
interstate
commerce
transaction,
that
if
any
controversy
leading
to
suit
between
lilly
and
its
wholesale
agents,
or
whatever
you
call
them,
its
wholesalers,
that
any
controversy
as
between
them
involving
entirely
shipment
of
goods
from
indiana
or
wherever,
to
the
wholesale,
some
controversy
as
to
what
was
due,
that
such
a
suit
could
be
brought
by
lilly
unregistered,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
i'm
going
to
infer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
couldn't
--
tell
that
from
this
decision,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
often
difficult
--
often
difficult
for
an
opinion
to
be
written
here,
at
least
it
would
be,
to
indicate
what
is
sustained
and
what
isn't,
assuming
we
go
in
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
satz,
at
what
stage
of
a
litigation
does
the
state
have
to
come
in
where
this
constitutionality
of
a
statute
or
its
applications
count?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
initiation
--
at
the
initiation
of
the
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
you
came
in
at
the
--
the
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
you
know,
we
have
a
statute
which
says
in
any
court,
where
the
requirement
is
in
any
court,
that's
right
isn't
it,
justice
black?
it
says
in
any
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
didn't
notice.
