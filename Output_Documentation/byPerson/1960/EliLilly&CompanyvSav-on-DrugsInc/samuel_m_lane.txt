mr.
samuel
m.
lane
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
inquire
whether
the
court
is
going
to
sit
up
to
the
half
hour?
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
4:30?
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well
then,
without
really
undertaking
my
argument
because
it's
obviously
difficult
with
only
four
minutes
to
go.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
may
i
call
your
attention
specifically
to
one
or
two
places
in
the
record
just
to
leave
a
part
with
you
over
the
evening.
if
the
court
would
please
look
at
the
transcript
of
record,
first,
i
would
suggest
the
top
of
page
36,
the
first
sentence
in
the
first
full
paragraph
at
the
top
of
page
36,
this
comes
in
the
first
section
of
judge
scherer's
opinion
and
he
says
there,
despite
the
above
recited
facts,
plaintiff
insist
that
it
is
not
doing
business
in
new
jersey.
now,
the
plaintiff
never
insisted
that
it
was
not
doing
an
intrastate
business
in
new
jersey.
and
so
when
the
judge
says
this,
"he
must
imply
to
the
finding
that
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
here,
was
doing
an
intrastate
business
in
new
jersey."
then
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no,
sir.
but
he
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
understand
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
what
does
he
mean
when
he
says,
"the
plaintiff
insists
that
it
is
not
doing
business
in
new
jersey."
what
he's
thinking
about
is
the
plaintiff
insists
that
it
is
not
doing
intrastate
business.
it
confesses
it's
doing
interstate
business.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
now,
would
you
please
look
at
the
sentence
that
you
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
now,
go
on
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
let
me
call
your
attention
to
the
sentence
that
your
honor
read
at
the
beginning
of
the
.second
paragraph,
second
section
of
page
38,
the
first
sentence.
your
honor,
i
suggested
that
that
was
a
holding
by
the
lower
court
that
the
plaintiff
was
doing
an
exclusively
interstate
business.
that's
not
what
he
said.
he
says
plaintiff
contends
that
it
is
accepted
from
any
requirements
to
comport
with
foreign
corporation
provisions
of
our
corporation
because
it
is
engaged
entirely
in
interstate
business.
it's
a
contention
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
nor
a
finding
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
just
want
to
leave
this
thought
in
your
mind.
i
think
the
way
judge
scherer
looked
at
this
was,
he
said
to
himself,
“i
will
examine
this
now
that
my
section
i
from
the
proposition
that
it's
doing
an
intrastate
business
despite
their
denial
that
they
are."
now,
having
done
that
and
having
found
that
there's
enough
intrastate
activity
so
that
they
should
comply
with
the
qualification
statute,
he
then
goes
on
and
says,
"let's
look
at
this
business
about
they're
doing
only
interstate
commerce,
which
they
contend
they're
doing
and
as
to
that,
i
find
that
the
burden
is
not
an
unreasonable
burden."
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
but
let
me
come
to
that.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
but
let
me
come
back
to
what
mr.
justice
brennan
said
at
the
outset.
what
if
we
try
this
on?
two
affidavits,
that's
all.
and
those
affidavits
don't
say,
“we
are
doing
an
exclusively
interstate
business”,
they
say,
“this
is
what
we
do.”
they
don't
say
whether
it's
a
fish
or
a
fowl.
and
what
judge
scherer
is
saying
is,
“thus,
we
don't
have
to
chop
it
into
intrastate
and
interstate.”
we've
done
that
in
this
appeal
here
and
i
will
try
to
tell
you
tomorrow
why
i
think
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
do
it.
we've
done
it
for
the
purpose
of
emphasis
and
it's
not
new.
it
comes
right
out
of
the
facts
that
are
in
there.
but
those
facts,
that
the
question
holds
the
new
jersey
judge
are
they
engaged
in
such
activities,
hold
it
what
you
will,
local
activities
that
they
should
follow
these
qualification
statutes
and
that
the
case
should
become
--
we
cite
by
union
brokerage
against
jensen.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no
problem.
and
of
course,
it
--
it
is
and
i'll
try
to
point
that
out
here
tomorrow
that
in
addition
to
the
interstate,
there's
such
a
clear
packing
of
local
business
promoting
local
sales
from
local
wholesalers
to
local
retailers
to
local
consumers
that,
of
course,
they
can
be
required
to
qualify.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
that's
right.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
is
so
important,
as
it
seems
to
me,
from
a
consideration
of
the
commerce
clause
and
my
time
is
so
short
in
any
event,
plus
the
fact
that
i
am
sharing
it
with
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
new
jersey.
and
i
shall
try
to
go
directly
to
the
point
instead
of
reviewing
what
i
think
is
the
trend
of
the
court
or
let's
say
the
difference
in
approach
to
such
prominence
as
is
today,
compared
with
1887,
when
you
had
robbins
against
shelby
county
and
cases
of
that
area.
i
may
say,
however,
parenthetically
in
the
beginning,
that
i
think
that
those
old
cases
like
robbins
against
shelby
county
and
crutcher
against
kentucky
and
not
so
old,
but
respectively
old
case,
international
textbook
against
pigg,
all
were
cases
in
which
the
state
was
attempting
to
set
up
a
barrier,
was
attempting
to
discriminate
against
out-of-state
commerce
and
industry.
and
i
will
suggest
to
you
and
i
think
mr.
satz
will
make
more
plain
view
that
that
is
not
at
all
the
object
of
the
registration
statute
that
we're
concerned
with
here.
now,
i
would
like
to
divide
my
argument
into
two
general
subdivisions.
the
first
has
to
do
with
the
applicability
of
this
statute.
if
you'll
look
at
lilly's
business
in
new
jersey,
as
local
commerce
separate
from
interstate
commerce
and
having
covered
that,
then
i
would
like
to
go
to
consider
the
applicability
of
the
statute
to
lilly's
activities
in
the
state,
if
you
consider
that
those
activities
are
wholly
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes,
the
--
the
court
has,
but
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
two
reasons
why
it
could
and
i
think
yesterday's
discussion
brought
out
that
the
lower
court
didn't
make
a
claim
why
it
did.
i
would
like
to
show
two
reasons,
two
general
reasons
why
i
think
it
could.
i'll,
first
of
all,
no
matter
which
branch
of
the
case
is
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
what
it
did,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
it
seems
to
me,
that
for
both
branches
of
this
discussion,
you
have
to
know
what,
in
fact,
lilly
does.
well,
this
is
what
it
does.
it's
engaged
in
the
manufacturing
sale
of
pharmaceuticals.
it
sells
its
pharmaceuticals
in
interstate
commerce
from
indianapolis,
its
headquarters
to
local
wholesalers
in
new
jersey.
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
the
company
maintains
a
head
office
in
new
--
new
jersey,
where
it
has
a
sales
manager
and
a
secretary.
the
company
pays
these
people
salaries.
it
pays
all
of
the
expenses
of
the
office.
and
working
under
this
sales
manager
are
18
detailmen,
who
travel
about
the
state
with
samples
and
literature
and
whatnot
and
they
brief
the
druggists,
the
hospitals,
the
doctors
on
the
virtues
of
lilly
products.
they
do
more
than
that.
they
check
stock
in
the
drugstores
to
see
that
there
is
an
adequate
supply.
they
police
fair
trade
observance
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
and
in
addition,
still
and
i
think,
quite
significantly
on
this
case,
they
pick
up
orders
from
the
local
druggists
and
transmit
those
orders
to
the
local
wholesalers.
and
i
think
also,
significantly,
they
do
not,
in
any
case,
pick
up
orders
from
anybody
for
transmission
to
the
home
office
in
indianapolis.
now
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
a
whole
logic
is
to
solicit
it.
i
don't
know
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
--
i
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
think,
they
sell
in
the
sense,
and
this
doesn't
appear
in
the
record,
but
they
have
hundreds
of
different
drugs.
they
must
have
lists
of
these
drugs.
and
they
check
the
stock
against
the
list
and
they
will
take
orders
from
the
druggist,
on
whose
blanks
or
forms,
i
don't
know,
justice
frankfurter.
but
the
record
shows,
they
do
take
orders
from
the
druggist
to
the
local
wholesaler,
to
be
filled
there.
now,
whether
they
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
the
--
the
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
they
solicit
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
they
solicit
the
interest.
the
record
doesn't
say
that
they
solicit
the
order.
it
says
in
effect,
they
solicit
the
interest
and
they
take
the
orders.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
and
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
this
is
what
it
says
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
page
27
of
the
record,
the
middle
of
the
last
paragraph,
"the
primary
purpose
of
said
employees,
is
to
acquaint
retail
pharmacists,
physicians
and
hospitals
with
the
products
of
eli
lilly
and
company
so
that
the
said
retail
pharmacies,
physicians,
and
hospitals
will
order
lilly
products
from
local
wholesaler
and
distributors.
and
then
you
add
to
that
--
that
they
also
admit
that
these
men
picked
up
those
orders
and
themselves,
transmit
them
to
the
local
distributors.
now,
time
is
galloping
here.
the
appellant
says,
"you
can't
separate
those
activities
from
interstate
commerce
because
the
whole
purpose
is
to
generate
the
interstate
sale
from
indianapolis
to
the
local
wholesaler."
we
say
they
are
separate
and
that
this
court
held
so
distinctly
and
unequivocally
in
the
northwestern
milling
company
case
which
was
one
of
a
puzzle
of
seven
cases
that
was
decided
under
the
name
of
cheney
bothers
against
massachusetts.
let
me
just
give
you
the
facts
quick.
in
the
cheney
brothers
case,
cheney
brothers
was
a
connecticut
corporation
which
had
a
sales
force
in
massachusetts.
the
salesmen
took
orders
and
transmitted
them
to
hartford
for
approval.
massachusetts
attempted
to
levy
an
excise
tax
for
that
privilege
and
this
court
said,
"no,
that's
purely
interstate
commerce."
in
the
same
basket
of
cases,
northwestern
milling
company
had
its
sales
force
in
massachusetts
and
its
salesmen
took
orders
from
massachusetts
retailers
and
gave
them
to
massachusetts
wholesalers,
who
in
turn
ordered
from
the
minnesota
or
whatever
it
was
planned
of
the
northwestern
company.
and
this
court
said,
"massachusetts
may
exact
an
excise
or
privilege
tax
for
that
because
that
is
separate
from
the
interstate
commerce."
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
refer,
your
honor,
to
your
own
opinion
in
freeman
against
hewitt
and
which
it
took
this
very
thing
up
and
you
said
that
the
burden
of
a
tax
on
that
kind
of
activity
is
so
much
greater
on
interstate
commerce
and
not
subject
to
the
safeguards
that
the
local
exercise
of
the
police
power
is
that
this
court
looks
more
--
scrutinizes
more
carefully,
the
case
where
you
tax
the
local
activity,
then
where
there
is
applied
to
it,
a
regulation
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
of
the
local
aspects
by
the
police
power.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no,
i'm
not
saying
it
can
do
anything
else.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
can
do
this.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no,
sir.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
no.
i
don't
say
it
can
do
this
because
it
can
tax.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
the
relevance
is
that
in
each
case,
there's
an
application
on
state
power,
that
something
which
a
taxpayer
says,
"you
may
not
tax
because
it's
burden
to
interstate
commerce."
and
we'd
say,
not
that
you
can
do
anything
to
a
foreign
corporation
that
you
can
do
it
or
domestic,
but
what
--
that
kind
of
a
case
is
the
american
express
against
virginia,
judge
--
justice
holmes'
decision.
we're
not
dealing
with
that
kind
of
a
case.
we're
not
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
doubt,
it
has
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
let
me
come
to
that.
i
doubt
it,
under
the
real
silk
hosiery
against
portland
case.
i
don't
believe
you
can.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
take
northwestern
portland
cement
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
another
tax
case,
you're
asking
me
now,
about
taxes.
if
you
take
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
alright.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i'll
--
i'll
accept
that
in
answer
to
your
question
without
reference
to
northwestern.
of
course,
this
is
not
in
the
case,
but
real
silk
hosiery
against
the
city
of
portland
has
direct
authority
that
you
couldn't
require
them
to
be
licensed.
and
we're
not
suggesting
that
you
could
require
them
to
be
licensed,
that
isn't
our
case
here.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
not,
unless
you
want
to
overrule
real
silk
against
portland,
but
that's
not
our
case.
now,
may
i
quickly
skip
along
here
because
your
clock
runs
so
fast.
the
appellant
says
that
we
can't
raise
this
point,
this
local
commerce
point
because
it's
a
no
point.
i
say
fiddlesticks
to
that.
we
didn't,
in
the
lower
court
say,
we
were
talking
only
about
interstate
commerce,
in
the
lower
court,
we
said,
we
were
talking
about
doing
business,
which
includes
every
aspect
of
the
doing
business,
whether
it's
separated
from
interstate
commerce
or
whether
it
isn't.
and
all
the
facts
are
in
the
record
and
i
say
that
we
did
not
concede
as
he
says,
we
did
that
it
was
exclusively
an
interstate
commerce
and
i
say
that
we're
not
raising
a
new
point.
he
then
says,
"well,
if
the
court
decides
that
we
are
raising
a
new
point,
we
can't
raise
it."
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
to
sustain
the
judgment
of
the
court
below,
to
that
also,
i
say
nonsense.
the
--
he
hasn't
cited
any
case
and
he
doesn't
make
any
sense
in
reason
or
logic
to
say
that
this
court
is
foreclosed
from
saying,
“if
this
is
a
new
argument
that
the
state
supreme
court
was
right
in
upholding
the
validity
of
its
statute,
i
think
it
would
be
different.
if
this
court
would
say
that
the
statute
was
invalid
for
a
reason
which
hadn't
been
offered
below,
when
this
court
sustains
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
situation
has
wiped
it.”
now,
therefore,
that
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes,
it
was.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
i
don't
have
them
with
me.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
of
course,
certainly.
therefore,
the
first
branch
of
our
case
is
that
there
were
local
activities.
here
was
a
local
force
which
did
nothing
but
serve
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
in
connection
with
promoting
local
sales
from
local
wholesalers
to
local
retailers,
to
local
consumers
and
in
policing
local
fair
trade
prices.
and
the
suit
which
they
want
to
bring
is
the
suit
under
the
state
statute
in
aid
of
the
policing
of
those
local
prices.
now,
coming
in
the
next
part
of
the
case
and
this
justice
frankfurter
is,
of
course,
where
union
brokerage
comes
in.
union
brokerage
operated
upon
the
hypothesis
that
the
union
brokerage
company
which
were
licensed
custom
house
brokers,
were
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
they
were
in
that
connection
highly
regulated
as
you
realized
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
these
brokers
have
a
semiprofessional
capacity.
they
passed
examinations
and
they
have
to
show
good
character
and
whatnot,
have
done.
they
are
supervised
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
now,
this
business
engaged
in
this
activity,
nevertheless,
this
court
said
in
union
brokerage
had
sufficient
contacts
with
the
people
of
minnesota,
sufficient
local
activities
so
that
a
registration
statute
could
be
applied
to
them
without
unconstitutionally
burdening
interstate
commerce.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
customers?
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
all
of
the
importers?
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
well,
the
state
of
minnesota
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
--
i
wouldn't
dream
of
it,
no.
but
that
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
yes,
that's
right.
and
we
say
that
all
of
the
activities
of
the
18
detailmen
and
the
sales
manager
and
the
secretary
have
to
do
exclusively
with
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
now,
my
opponent
says
that
union
brokerage
against
jensen
doesn't
apply
and
i
quote,
"it
involved
a
corporation
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
actual
importation
or
exportation
of
goods
and
carried
out
all
of
its
business
transactions
entirely
in
the
confines
of
minnesota."
and
i
say
to
that,
so
what.
the
same
thing
was
true
in
texas
transportation
against
new
orleans,
the
same
thing
was
true
in
puget
sound
stevedoring
company
against
tax
commission,
the
same
thing
was
true
in
the
case
that
i
argued
here,
some
14
or
15
years
ago,
joseph
against
carter
&
weekes.
the
union
brokerage
company
was
operating
exclusively
on
--
on
foreign
commerce
and
yet
this
court
said,
"a
statute
which
requires
it
to
identify
itself
to
the
citizens
of
minnesota
and
which
denies
it
access
to
the
courts
until
it
does,
does
not
cast
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce."
and
i
say
that
precisely
the
same
thing
is
approved
here.
now,
my
time
is
up
and
i'll
introduce
to
the
court,
mr.
david
satz.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
it's
on
the
record,
but
stands
to
reason,
justice
black
that
the
wholesalers,
the
pharmaceutical
wholesalers,
like
mckesson
and
robbins
let's
say
or
some
big
wholesale
house
in
new
jersey,
gets
the
benefit
of
what
these
lilly
employees
do,
but
at
the
same
time,
if
it's
going
to
survive,
it
must
have
its
own
employees
that
go
around
soliciting
sales
of
other
--
mr.
samuel
m.
lane
they're
precisely
the
same
as
is
here,
except
that
somebody
else
should
be
paying
them.
somebody
else
should
pay
their
salary
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
other
difference
at
all.
