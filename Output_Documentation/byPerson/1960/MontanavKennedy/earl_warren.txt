john
montana,
petitioner
versus
robert
f.
kennedy,
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
ms.
lavin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
he
was
admitted
as
a
united
states
citizen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
is
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
what
the
administrative
practice
was
during
those
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
father
ever
naturalized?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
also
uncontradicted
that
she
did
go
to
the
consul
and
asked
for
a
passport
and
was
denied?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
say
you
contradict
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well,
i'm
not
asking
about
your
doubts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
asking
about
your
doubts,
i'm
asking
about
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
talking
about
what
was
uncontradicted
and
i
merely
asked
you
if
it
was
uncontradicted
in
the
record
that
she
went
to
the
--
the
consul
and
asked
for
a
passport,
and
it
was
denied.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
equivocate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
ask
the
judge
to
make
a
finding
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
because
his
father
was
an
alien?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
revert
just
a
moment
to
--
again
to
what
i
asked
you
about
her
going
to.
do
you
say
that
it's
incomprehensible
that
this
woman
would
--
would
go
to
the
consul
and
--
and
that
she
would
be
denied.
why
do
you
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
--
and
was
inconceivable
that
--
that
she
would
not
go
there
and
ask
for
a
passport
before
baby
died
or
before
a
baby
was
born,
why
would
she
go
afterwards
and
get
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
didn't
she
get
a
passport
to
come
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what,
is
there
a
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
she
was
--
if
she
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
would
she
have
needed
a
passport?
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
she
was
a
citizen
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
finding
in
the
record?
do
you
have
it,
mr.
gordon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
conclusion
of
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
you
--
you
speak
of
the
findings.
now,
the
two
findings
that
you
point
out
are
two
and
five
on
page
39.
number
two
says,
“plaintiff's
mother,
madelyn
montana
was
born
on
october
2nd,
1890
at
jersey
city,
new
jersey
and
has
since
that
date,
continuously
been
a
native
and
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
who
has
never
surrendered
or
lost
her
citizenship
or
expatriated
herself.”
certainly,
there's
no
finding
there
that
it
was
--
it
was
not
true.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
then
number
five,
“plaintiff
entered
the
united
states
of
america
on
september
19th,
1906
when
he
was
approximately
three
moths
old,
having
been
brought
to
the
united
states
from
italy
by
his
mother,
madelyn
montana.”
certainly,
there
is
nothing
there
that
indicates
it.
now,
where
is
the
finding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
found
that
all
the
facts
worked
against
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
talk
--
i
was
talking
about
the
finding
of
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
that's
all
i
ask
you.(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
answer
that
after
–[recess]
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gordon,
just
one
other
question.
i
understood
counsel
to
say
when
--
when
he
came
to
this
country
three
months
of
age,
he
was
registered
as
a
--
as
a
citizen.
now,
who
was
that
done
by?
is
that
done
by
the
government
based
upon
any
research
or
is
that
done
by
the
parents?
chief
justice
earl
warren
37
of
the
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
why
do
you
say
--
why
do
you
say
it's
a
mistake?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it's
his
--
if
it's
his
duty
to
--
to
state
whether
--
whether
the
child
is
a
citizen
or
not,
why
do
you
say
it's
a
mistake?
what
is
there
in
the
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
there
in
the
record
to
indicate
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but
it
might
--
might
not
that
go
to
the
question
of
--
of
whether
the
government
is
foreclosed
from
--
from
now
claiming
he
isn't
a
citizen
if
he
came
in
three
months
of
age
and
the
government
said
that
he
was
a
citizen
and
he's
lived
here
for
56
years
or
so,
wouldn't
that
bear
on
it
very
materially?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
there
anything
in
the
--
in
the
record
to
show
this
was
caused
by
fraud
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
anything
like
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
is
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
except
the
law
that
time
that
it
was
a
mistake?
chief
justice
earl
warren
error
of
law,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
go
farther
--
as
i
recall,
counsel,
she
said
that
that
--
that
particular
quotation
that
you
just
read
referred
to
a
subsequent
section
of
the
act
and
not
--
not
this
particular
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
the
house
report
to
say
about
that
section
5
of
the
1934
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood
the
--
the
house
report
made
it
clear
that
the
amendment
was
intended
merely
to
state
expressly
whether
it'd
been
implicit
in
the
1907
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
