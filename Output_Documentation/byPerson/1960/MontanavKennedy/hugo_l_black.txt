justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
because
i
don't
quite
understand
the
argument.
are
you
saying
that
that
would
make
a
difference
if
she
had
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
frequently
have
that
but
they're
not
usually
just
thrown
out.
assuming
it
is
material,
they
are
not
just
usually
thrown
out
because
somebody
says
they're
interested,
we
don't
like
what
it
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that
maybe
it
would,
i
--
i
have
read
your
finding
but
i
do
not
understand
why
you
say,
his
finding,
that
he
was
not
a
citizen,
shows
as
a
finding
that
she
didn't
go
to
the
--
to
get
her
passport?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
i've
been
looking
at
the
record,
does
it
does
show
why
he's
being
deported?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
why
this
man
is
being
deported?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
if
it
is
not
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you,
(voice
overlap)
if
it
was
in
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mustn't
respond
to
every
curiosity
that
one
may
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
that
while
some
authorities
have
said
--
did
i
misunderstood
what
you
said
a
moment
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
if
you
please.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
how
if
--
if
anyone
read
the
word
“persons”
in
this
to
go
no
further
than
these
statutes.
they
could
say
that
the
--
the
parent
of
a
father,
was
a
citizen
or
the
parent
of
the
mother
wasn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
in
--
you
mean
to
looking
--
looking
at
other
statutes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
within
the
four
corners
of
this
statute,
could
that
distinction
be
drawn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
here
i
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
question
was,
if
you
look
at
the
four
corners
of
this
statute,
its
language
and
nothing
else,
could
that
distinction
be
drawn?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
question.
where
is
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
elimination
of
the
word
father
in
the
1802
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
28,
you
don't
say
it's
18.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
1802
act
appears
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
18
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
now
where
is
the
statement
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
why
would
that
have
been
taken
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
--
was
this
law
in
effect
at
that
time,
the
act
of
72?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
happens
in
that
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
passed?
