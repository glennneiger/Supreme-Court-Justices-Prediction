justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
may
i
ask,
is
that
really
a
re-enactment
under
your
view
or
is
it
just
a
rearrangement
or
re-codification
of
an
existing
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
do
you
understand
the
phrase
in
the
statute
reading
“who
are
now”
refer
to
1874
and
not
1802?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
don't
you
think
from
that
statute
passed
in
1802,
congress
used
that
word
“now”
with
the
view
of
relating
to
the
question
offers
as
a
word
in
1802,
children
as
--
as
of
--
as
of
--
born
abroad
of
persons
who
were
then
citizens
were
made
citizens?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
might
i
ask
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
please
ms.
lavin,
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection,
in
--
in
connection
with
the
argument
you've
just
made,
then
what
would
have
been
the
purpose
in
1855
for
congress
by
section
1993
to
make
citizens
of
children
born
out
of
this
country
to
united
states
fathers,
only
fathers.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
ms.
lavin
--
if
i
may
ask,
let's
try
to
(inaudible)
on
persons
resuming
citizenship
or
being
naturalized?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
we
would
have
more
application
than
to
this
one
whose
endeavor
was
an
alien?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
statute
does
not
really
need
in
the
--
that
it
shall
apply
only
to
persons
resuming
citizenship
or
being
naturalized,
but
as
you
treat
it,
applies
to
persons
who
were
never
aliens?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
should
have,
although
is
one
thing
if
it's
dependent
upon
congressional
action,
limited
to
what
we
did
do?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
where
does
this
argument
get
us?
as
i
understand,
it's
designed
only
to
the
possibility
that
if
she
had
been
allowed
to
comeback,
petitioner
might
have
been
born
in
the
united
states.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that's
not
the
fact,
so
why
aren't
we
confronted
with
realities
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
clearly,
i'm
confused
about
this
but
i
just
not
understand
the
1802
act
merely
in
reference
what
you
just
tell
me
with
that
person.
