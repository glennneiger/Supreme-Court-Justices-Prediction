mr.
charles
gordon
thank
you
your
honor.
may
i
please
the
court.
this
suit
seeks
a
judicial
declaration
of
citizenship.
it
was
brought
after
the
entry
of
a
deportation
order.
in
the
district
court,
the
trial
court
conducted
a
hearing
de
novo,
permitted
petitioner
to
present
his
proof
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
granted
the
motion
to
dismiss.
the
court
found
that
petitioner
had
not
established
a
title
to
united
state
citizenship
under
the
constitution
or
under
any
statutes.
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed.
now,
the
facts
of
course
are
simple.
petitioner
was
born
in
italy
in
1906.
his
parents
had
been
married
the
previous
year
in
the
united
states
and
had
gone
to
italy
on
a
visit
with
mrs.
montana's
parents.
at
the
time
they
went
to
italy,
mrs.
montana
was
about
four
months
pregnant.
after
the
child
was
born,
the
--
the
mother
brought
the
child
back
to
this
country,
the
child
was
then
about
three-months
old
and
he
has
continued
to
reside
in
this
country
since
that
time.
now,
it
is
undisputed
that
at
--
at
the
time
of
the
child's
birth,
the
mother
was
an
american
citizen.
she
was
born
in
this
country
and
had
never
lost
her
citizenship.
it
is
also
undisputed
that
at
the
time
of
the
child's
birth,
the
father
was
an
alien
and
that
he
has
remained
an
alien
until
the
present
time.
now,
these
are
the
simple
and
controlling
facts
that
the
petitioner
was
born
outside
of
the
united
states
in
1906,
that
at
the
time
of
his
birth
his
father
was
an
alien
and
his
mother
an
american
citizen.
building
from
these
facts
--
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
it
is
not
--
it
is
contradicted
by
us
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
oppose
the
story.
this
is
the
story
so
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
we
--
we
doubt
it.
i
can't
say
i
--
i
contradict
it,
we
doubt
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
we
have
no
basis
for
contradicting.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
record
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way.
i'll
say
that
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
is
the
testimony
of
the
mother.
mr.
charles
gordon
because
she
is
an
interested
witness
and
i
think
this
is
not
a
patently
incredible
story,
a
story
which
is
very
convenient
and
is
told
for
the
first
time
without
any
corroboration
50
years
after
the
alleged
event.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
the
judge
made
a
complete
finding
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence.
he
said
that
the
petitioner,
plaintiff
in
the
case
before
him
has
failed
to
sustain
the
burden
of
showing
himself
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
for
every
reason
that
he
is
alleged.
mr.
charles
gordon
this
is
one
of
the
reasons.
the
judge
didn't
say
that.
the
judge
said
two
things.
he
said
petitioner,
plaintiff
in
that
--
in
the
case
before
him,
has
failed
to
show
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
under
the
constitution
or
under
any
statute.
two,
petitioner
has
failed
to
sustain
the
burden
of
proving
himself
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
these
are
the
findings
of
the
court.
that
is
all
the
court
said
and
i
think
the
court
was
considering
all
the
evidence,
he
was
there,
the
testimony
was
before
him
and
i
think
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence,
he
made
a
complete
finding
on
all
the
contentions
which
were
made
by
the
petitioner.
now,
obviously,
there's
no
citizenship
right
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
says
the
petitioner
was
not
born
in
the
united
states.
therefore,
any
claim
to
citizenship
must
dependent
on
some
specific
statute
enacted
by
congress.
mr.
charles
gordon
well
your
honor,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
fact
is
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
opinion
in
kent
against
dulles,
the
majority
opinion,
at
the
time
that
petitioner
was
in
europe
in
1906,
petitioner's
mother,
excuse
me
--
mr.
charles
gordon
--
the
laws
of
this
country
did
not
require
a
passport
for
a
person
who
wished
to
come
to
the
united
states.
so
that
it
--
it
wasn't
conceivable
that
a
--
a
lady
in
mrs.
montana's
condition
who
wished
for
a
passport
and
came
up
to
the
consul,
wished
it
for
all
convenience,
would
ask
for
a
passport
would
be
denied
it.
what
would
be
the
point
of
the
consul
denying
a
passport
which
was
not
required
as
a
document
for
entry
under
our
laws?
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor
i
--
i
say
that
that
is
not
supported
in
the
record.
again
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
the
logical
assumption
is
that
if
a
person
wanted
a
passport,
he
would've
obtained
it
before
leaving
the
united
states.
now,
it's
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
she
did
--
she
says
she
did.
mr.
charles
gordon
even
that
is
a
questionable
because
this
is
based
only
on
her
own
statement.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
such
a
document.
mr.
charles
gordon
she
wouldn't
have
needed
a
passport
either
way.
mr.
charles
gordon
but
that
is
true,
whether
--
you're
right.
if
--
if
she
were
an
alien,
she
would
not
have
needed
any
document.
if
she
was
a
citizen
she'd,
likewise,
would
not
have
needed
a
document
at
that
time.
all
a
person
had
to
do
at
that
time
was
to
buy
a
ticket,
get
on
a
boat
and
come
to
the
united
states.
and
then
at
the
port,
he
would
be
admitted
if
were
admissible.
as
a
citizen,
she
would've
been
admissible
without
any
doubt.
as
i
say,
i
think
the
--
the
crux
of
this
thing
is
that
all
these
depends
on
what
she
says
now
50
years
odd
later
when
she
has
an
obvious
interest
in
the
controversy.
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
--
i'm
not
saying
that
it
would
make
a
difference,
but
i'm
saying,
taking
the
argument
at
its
utmost,
assuming
that
a
passport
had
been
applied
for,
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
consul
would
have
denied
a
passport
under
these
circumstances
and
we
say
this
is
the
story
of
an
interesting
--
a
witness
who
has
an
obvious
interest.
mr.
charles
gordon
but
it
can
be
disbelieved
and
we
believe
that
the
trial
court
was
the
best
judge
of
it
here,
sir.
we
believe
that
the
trial
court,
after
hearing
this
story,
said,
“i've
heard
your
argument.
i've
heard
your
theories
which
were
advanced
before
him,
the
same
theory
and
i
find
that
you
haven't
sustained
the
burden
of
proving
yourself
to
be
a
citizenship
of
the
united
states.”
that,
we
believe
is
a
complete
finding
on
every
contention
which
was
advanced
before
him.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
here
it
is,
i'm
sorry.(voice

--
the
judges'
finding
at
page
39
and
the
first
finding
is
number
three,
the
one
that
he's
not
a
citizenship
under
the
constitution
or
under
any
statute.
the
second
is
number
four,
right
below
it
--
rather,
number
five.
number
five
on
the
next
page.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
assuming
your
honor
that
it
might
be
material
that
a
--
if
a
consul
had
acted
in
this
fashion
and
then
denied
a
passport,
that
might
have
--
assuming
that
might
have
create
an
estoppel,
then
it
would
be
incumbent
on
the
judge
to
determine
whether
such
a
situation
actually
had
occurred.
this
was
evidence
which
was
produced
at
the
trial.
the
contention
was
made
before
judge
miner
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
proceedings
that
there
was
an
estoppel
and
therefore
it
was
a
contention
before
him.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
judge
miner
said,
“i
find
that
plaintiff
has
not
sustained,
petitioner
now
has
not
sustained
the
burden
of
showing
himself
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
charles
gordon
this
is
--
mr.
charles
gordon
there
is
no
finding
of
fact
on
this
issue
--
mr.
charles
gordon
as
a
matter
of
law.
oh
no,
he
did
not
find
a
matter
of
fact.
i
--
i'm
sorry
if
i
--
mr.
charles
gordon
there
was
no
specific
finding
of
fact
on
that
question.
mr.
charles
gordon
there
is
a
finding
of
law
which
i
think
comprehends
all
the
contentions
that
were
made
before
him.
mr.
charles
gordon
it's
certain
is.
it's
one
of
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
on
the
estoppel?
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
we
--
mr.
charles
gordon
we
--
we
believe
whether
there
were
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
this
--
in
the
first
place
that
this
--
the
story
is
so
patiently
incredible
that
the
court
below
did
not
believe
it
and
that
it
should
not
be
believed
here.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
secondly,
we
think
that
if
there
was
any
such
action,
the
action
of
the
consul
in
--
in
denying
a
passport
which
was
not
required
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
woman's
coming
to
the
united
states.
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
buy
a
ticket
and
go
to
the
boat
and
come
to
the
united
states.
because
of
--
mr.
charles
gordon
thank
you,
sir.
reverting
to
the
question
which
we
were
discussing
in
the
intermission,
position
that
the
government
takes
is
about
this.
we
doubt
that
the
action
of
a
counsel
--
consul,
court
preclude
the
united
states
from
pointing
out
and
contending
that
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
had
not
been
complied
with
or
that
the
provisions
of
a
statute
have
not
been
complied
with.
however,
even
if
it
were
found
that
a
consul
by
some
action
could
preclude
or
estop
the
united
states,
we
believe
that
there
is
no
basis
for
such
an
estoppel
in
the
instant
case
because
if
an
estoppel
possibly
could
arise,
it
would
arise
only
if
the
wrongful
action
of
the
consul
directly
deprived
an
individual
of
a
right
or
of
the
privilege
of
completing
certain
steps
which
would
give
him
a
right.
now,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
such
right.
there
was
no
right
to
come
to
the
united
states
with
a
passport.
there
was
no
requirement
of
a
passport.
the
only
thing
that
appears
in
this
record
is
mrs.
montana's
statement
that
she
went
to
the
consul
and
asked
him
about
the
coming
back
to
the
united
states
and
he
said,
“i'm
sorry
mrs.,
you
cannot
in
that
condition.
come
back
after
you
get
your
baby.”
now,
there's
no
testimony
in
this
record
that
mrs.
montana
thought
she
needed
a
passport
or
that
the
consul
told
her
that
she
needed
a
passport
and
there
certainly
couldn't
be
any
showing
that
there
was
a
requirement
of
a
law
of
the
united
states
that
she
had
to
have
a
passport
to
come
back
to
the
united
states.
the
fact
is
as
this
court
has
said,
and
any
research
will
show
that
in
1906,
our
laws
did
not
have
a
requirement
of
any
document
for
anybody
whether
he
was
citizen
or
an
alien
as
a
requirement
for
coming
to
the
united
states.
now,
we
say
that
taking
mrs.
montana's
testimony
at
its
maximum,
the
most
it
amounts
to
is
a
statement
that
she
went
to
the
consul
and
he
told
her
to
come
back
some
other
time.
we
think
that
there
are
other
matters
--
there
is
other
testimony
by
her,
by
mrs.
montana
herself
which
cast
doubt
on
this
story
of
a
fact
that
consul
refused
her
a
passport.
for
example,
mrs.
montana
testified
that
she
went
with
her
parents
to
a
little
town
and
that
the
officials
in
this
little
town
without
any
difficulty,
without
any
hesitancy
issued
passports
to
her
parents,
that
they
told
her
to
go
to
naples
for
her
own
passport.
now,
if
the
officials
in
the
little
town
which
is
not
described
had
authority
to
issue
passports
to
her
parents,
why
didn't
those
officials
have
authority
to
issue
the
passport
to
mrs.
montana?
why
was
it
necessary
to
sent
her
to
naples
where
this
alleged
incident
occurred?
it
is
also
said,
it
was
argued
by
counsel
today
and
was
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
this
passport
might
have
been
a
requirement
under
italian
law,
it
might
have
been.
is
there
any
showing
in
the
record
of
any
such
requirement?
is
there
any
mention
in
the
brief
of
any
requirement
of
italian
law?
no,
this
is
complete
speculation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
showing
that
this
passport
was
required
for
anything
except
the
supposed
convenience
of
mrs.
montana,
the
wish
to
obtain
a
passport.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
so,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
sir
and
i
believe
that
is
the
proper
approach.
the
fact
is
that
the
constitution
grants
citizenship
to
persons
born
in
the
united
states.
mr.
montana
was
not
born
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
ell,
that
--
that
also
depends,
sir,
on
some
additional
assumptions.
the
first
of
these
is
that
the
story
is
believed
and
of
course
i
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
one.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
second
is
i
think
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
--
that
we
contend
and
we
believe
that
the
record
--
mr.
charles
gordon
alrightt,
that
--
that's
the
first.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
our
first
position
and
the
second
position
is
that
even
if
there
were
such
an
estoppel
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
the
second
--
does
he
--
there's
still
a
third,
that
even
if
the
consul
did
this,
it
did
not
directly
result
in
the
deprivation
of
a
right.
there
was
no
right
to
a
passport
as
an
instrument
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
your
honor
there's
nothing
of
the
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
the
assumption
that
she
couldn't
have
or
wouldn't
have
--
mr.
charles
gordon
--
gotten
to
the
country
regardless
of
the
consul's
statement.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
so,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
now,
if
i
may
proceed
to
--
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
this
phase
and
i'll
be
glad
to
have
some
any
further
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
--
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
i
--
i
can
tell
you,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
as
a
matter
of
information,
i'd
be
glad
to
tell
you,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
not
relevant
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
because
i'm
asked.
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
not
in
the
record,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don't
think
i
have
any
alternatives,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
your
honor.
when
the
person
comes
to
the
united
states
--
i
refer
to
page
37
of
the
record.
mr.
charles
gordon
when
any
person
comes
to
the
united
states,
a
record
of
his
arrival
is
established
under
law.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
at
the
time
of
his
arrival,
the
immigration
officer
who
recorded
this
recorded
the
child
as
a
citizen.
mr.
charles
gordon
so
we
contend
that
this
was
an
error.
there
was
no
hearing,
no
adjudication.
the
mother
came
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
the
child
was
recorded
as
a
citizen.
now,
the
most
that
can
happen
here
is
that
this
officer
made
a
mistake
and
that
mistake
can
be
corrected.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
(voice
overlap)
i'd
like
to
--
i'd
like
to
show
you
your
honor
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
because
the
fact
is
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
the
fact
is
that
he
was
not
a
citizen
as
we
show
--
show
if
your
honor
will
permit
me.
the
fact
is
that
under
the
law,
he
had
no
claim
for
citizenship.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
i
think
it
might
possibly,
but
the
answer
to
that
is
--
that's
--
in
some
cases
that
have
considered
similar
situations,
court
below
considered
it,
sir.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
most
that
can
happen
under
certain
circumstances
if
an
administrative
officer
makes
a
determination,
the
most
that
can
happen
is
that
a
prima
facie
title
is
established
and
that
title
can
be
rebutted
by
a
clear,
unequivocal
and
convincing
showing
that
that
was
induced
by
fraud
or
error
and
the
courts
that
have
considered
this
have
said
that
the
error
encompasses
error
of
law
or
error
of
fact.
now
--
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
no.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir.
we
contend
that
this
is
purely
--
mr.
charles
gordon
it
is
an
error
of
law
in
our
--
mr.
charles
gordon
now
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
get
to
the
phases
of
the
argument
dealing
with
whether
mr.
montana
is
a
citizen.
at
the
time
of
mr.
montana's
birth
in
1906,
the
controlling
statute
was
r.s.
1993.
that
statute
provided
that
any
child
heretofore
or
hereafter
born
being
both
prospective
and
retrospective,
should
become
a
citizen
only
if
born
to
an
american
father,
provided,
the
father
had
previously
resided
in
the
united
states.
now,
petitioner
obviously
can
claim
no
right
under
this
statute,
since
his
father
was
not
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
however,
petitioner
claims
that
under
another
section
of
the
revised
statutes,
2172,
he
got
a
right
to
citizenship.
2172
speaks
of
the
children
of
persons
who
now
are,
or
who
have
been
citizens
and
confers
the
rights
of
citizenship
on
those
people.
now,
we
believe
that
the
--
the
position
expressed
here
by
the
petitioner
is
one
that
is
completely
unsupportable
because
it
disregards
not
only
the
language
and
the
structure
of
the
statute
itself,
but
also
its
history,
its
interpretation,
its
manifest
pertinence.
now,
the
basic
principle
for
the
transmission
of
citizenship
under
the
common
law
was
known
as
the
used
solely.
that's
the
principle
now
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
used
(inaudible),
which
is
the
principle
of
transmission
by
descent
or
by
blood
was
not
a
common
law
principle.
this
was
dependent
on
statutes
and
statutes
from
the
beginning
of
the
republic
had
made
limited
provision
for
the
transmission
of
citizens
--
citizenship.
these
provisions
were
in
effect
at
different
times.
now,
the
1802
law
which
has
been
mentioned
before
was
a
codification,
in
every
statement
of
earlier
laws
dealing
with
the
transmission
of
citizenship.
in
the
1802
law,
as
in
section
2172
of
the
revised
statutes,
the
rights
of
citizenship
were
granted
to
the
children
of
persons
who
now
are
or
have
been
citizens
of
the
united
states.
in
1854,
mr.
horace
binney,
who
was
then
a
noted
lawyer
of
the
era,
wrote
an
article
in
which
he
took
the
position
that
this
law
was
not
prospective.
he
said,
“this
was
a
bad
thing
and
it
should
be
corrected
by
congress.”
the
following
year,
congress
undoubtedly
in
response
to
his
suggestion
enacted
section
of
the
1855
act
which
is
the
predecessor
of
the
section
1993.
that
statute
was
effective
as
i
have
said
heretofore
or
hereafter,
both
children
heretofore
born
or
hereafter
born
whose
fathers
are
citizens
of
the
united
states.
and
the
law
also
contained
a
condition
that
citizenship
could
not
be
transmitted
unless
the
father
had
previously
resided
in
the
united
states.
now,
section
1993
was
continued,
it
--
as
i've
said,
it
codified
the
1855
law
and
then
it
continued
in
effect
until
1934.
mr.
charles
gordon
not
exactly.
not
in
--
not
in
the
exact
terms.
there
was
a
significant
omission.
the
omission
left
out
the
proviso
which
precluded
the
transmission
of
citizenship
unless
the
father
had
previously
resided
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
additional
point
before
i
--
i
show
you
what
the
significance
of
that
was.
in
1934
when
congress
amended
section
1993,
congress
provided
for
the
first
time
that
citizenship
could
be
transmitted
by
--
to
a
child
born
abroad
to
american
citizen
father
or
a
mother.
and
in
making
this
change,
congress
was
careful
to
restrict
the
operation
of
the
statute
to
children
hereafter
born,
thus,
very
clearly
denoting
its
wish
not
to
disturb
status
that
was
previously
vested.
now,
in
order
to
succeed,
petitioner
must
show
first
that
the
relevant
provision
of
section
2172,
which
is
the
second
clause,
was
prospective.
we
believe
that
this
contention
depends
on
a
number
of
--
of
propositions
which
are
unsupportable.
in
the
first
place,
we
point
to
the
language
of
the
statute
and
of
course
the
language
says,
“the
children
of
persons
who
now
are
or
who
have
been
citizens
shall
be
citizens.”
this
is
not
prospective
language,
particularly
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
which
i'll
develop
in
a
moment
and
it
is
quite
significant
that
when
congress
wished
to
speak
for
the
future,
it
had
no
difficulty
in
selecting
appropriate
language.
thus,
in
the
1855
law
and
in
its
successor
section
1993,
congress
spoke
of
the
children
of
--
heretofore
or
hereafter
born.
when
congress
amended
section
1993,
it
spoke
of
the
children
hereafter
born.
now,
no
comparable
language
appears
in
the
second
clause
of
rs
2172,
but
second
and
more
important,
your
honors
will
observe
that
this
language,
the
second
clause,
was
a
virtually
identical
restatement
of
the
1802
law
as
we've
mentioned.
yet,
there
was
unanimous
agreement
that
the
language
of
the
1802
law,
the
second
clause,
was
not
prospective.
this
was
the
point
of
view
expressed
by
mr.
horace
binney
in
his
1854
article.
it
was
apparently
also
shared
by
congress
in
enacting
the
1855
law
the
following
year.
indeed,
in
the
debates
on
the
1855
law,
congressman
cutting,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill,
and
other
members
of
congress
specifically
said,
“we
acknowledge
that
the
1802
law
was
not
prospective
and
that
the
new
legislation
was
needed
to
remedy
the
defect
in
the
prior
law.”
mr.
charles
gordon
it
was
not
signed
but
it
actually
was
a
--
a
reprint
of
a
--
a
publication
of
the
previous
year.
mr.
charles
gordon
your
honor,
i
don't
recall,
but
let
me
refer
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
i
--
of
course
the
supreme
court,
this
court,
in
two
decisions
specifically
mentioned
mr.
binney
by
name
has
that
this
was
a
correct
interpretation
and
that
the
1855
law
was
passed
in
order
to
correct
this
defect.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
--
i
don't
recall
--
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don't
recall
when
they
specifically
mentioned
that.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
was.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
find
that
out,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
he
was
--
he
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
bar
in
that
period.
now,
as
i've
mentioned
in
this
court
twice
on
two
separate
occasions,
i
called
attention
to
the
defect
in
the
1802
law
which
was
revealed
by
mr.
binney
and
stated
that
the
1855
law
was
passed
to
remedy
this
defect.
the
same
conclusion
was
reached
by
every
other
lower
court
decision
which
has
considered
the
matter
and
the
same
conclusion
also
was
reached
by
chancellor
kent
in
his
commentaries.
chancellor
kent
said
that
this
provision
is
clearly
not
prospective.
mr.
binney
said
this
provision
indisputably
is
not
prospective.
now,
our
brief
mentions
the
14th
edition
of
chancellor
kent's
commentaries.
now,
i've
taken
the
trouble
to
search
the
earlier
editions
and
find
that
every
edition
from
the
first
edition
in
1826
down
through
the
14th
which
we
have
cited,
made
exactly
the
same
statement.
this
included
the
12th
edition
which
was
edited
by
one
o.
w.
holmes
jr,
i
find
and
which
was
published
in
1873,
the
year
before
the
revised
statutes,
is
--
i
think
is
quite
significant
as
a
part
of
the
legislative
history.
now,
petitioner
now
contends
that
every
published
interpretation
of
the
18
--
the
revised
statutes
and
the
1802
law
was
wrong
and
that
it
is
now
possible
to
read
this
language
as
being
prospective.
we
submit
that
in
the
face
of
the
unanimous
verdict
of
everybody,
the
verdict
of
the
legal
scholars
including
chancellor
kent
in
1826,
horace
binney
in
1854,
justice
holmes
in
1873,
the
verdict
of
the
decisions
including
two
leading
expressions
by
this
court,
the
verdict
of
the
legislative
history
including
direct
statements
in
the
legislative
history
preceding
the
1855
law
and
another
similar
statement
in
the
comprehensive
study
made
in
1906
preceding
the
citizenship
law
of
1907.
we
submit
that
in
the
face
of
this
unanimous
verdict
of
everybody
who
has
studied
the
subject
that
it
is
not
now
possible
to
read
the
language
of
the
1802
law
and
of
its
restatement
in
1874
as
being
prospective.
now,
even
if
it
could
be
found
that
the
language
is
prospective
and
we've
been
--
this
we
deny,
even
if
this
could
be
found,
we
submit
that
petitioner
still
must
fail,
because
petitioner's
claim
depends
on
a
finding
that
2172
intended
to
confer
citizenship
on
the
child
born
abroad
to
an
alien
father
and
a
citizen
mother.
again,
we
say
this
interpretation
conflicts
irreconcilably
with
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
statute
--
of
this
language
with
the
statute
itself
and
with
its
legislative
history.
now,
comparable
language
is
business
about
the
children
or
person.
this
is
the
--
the
issue
of
the
case.
does
that
mean
the
children
of
the
father
or
the
mother?
comparable
language
was
made
--
was
used
in
the
1802
law.
now,
the
use
of
the
plural
at
that
time
and
in
1874
was
not
an
accident.
it
reflected
the
common
law
concept
of
family
unity
with
the
father,
the
spokesman
of
the
unity.
that
concept
of
family
unity
was
contained
in
our
citizenship
laws
until
1934.
that
concept
was
endorsed.
in
the
leading
decision
of
this
court
in
mackenzie
against
hare
decided
in
1915.
when
congress
used
the
word,
“the
children
of
persons”
we
believe
it
was
referring
to
situations
where
both
parents
were
citizens.
now,
some
authorities
have
construed
this
language
a
bit
more
liberally.
some
authorities
construing
the
first
clause,
not
the
second,
there
aren't
any
authorities
taking
this
view
under
the
second
clause,
the
first
clause
related
to
the
derivation
of
citizenship
by
the
children
of
aliens
who
were
naturalized.
some
authorities
say
that
the
first
clause
includes
situation
--
provision
for
the
transmission
of
citizenship
through
a
father,
a
father
who
was
naturalized.
now,
we
think
that
this
perhaps
is
a
permissible
interpretation
in
the
light
of
the
common
law
concept
of
family
unity
which
was
then
incorporated
in
our
statutes,
the
father
being
the
chief
spokesman
of
the
unit.
moreover,
under
our
laws
at
that
time,
when
an
alien
woman
married
a
citizen,
she
automatically
became
a
citizen.
so
when
congress
spoke
of
the
children
of
persons,
if
the
father
was
a
citizen,
both
parents
automatically
were
citizens,
but
we
think
that
no
interpretation
of
anybody,
no
court,
no
commentator,
no
legislative
spokesman
has
every
suggested
that
it
is
possible
to
read
the
language
of
the
1874
revised
statute
section
2172
or
of
its
predecessor
in
1802
as
granting
citizenship
to
a
child
born
abroad
to
a
citizen
mother
and
an
alien
father.
mr.
charles
gordon
can
i
restate
that
sir?
mr.
charles
gordon
some
authorities
have
said
that
where
the
father
alone
is
a
citizen
and
the
mother
maybe
an
alien,
the
father
alone
can
transmit
citizenship,
but
that
we
say
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
philosophy
of
the
statutes
then
in
effect.
the
father
was
then
the
dominant
member
of
the
family
unit.
moreover,
in
addition
to
that
under
the
laws
then
in
effect,
if
an
alien
woman
married
an
american
citizen,
she
automatically
became
an
american
citizen,
so
that
if
you
talk
of
a
father
being
a
citizen
automatically,
the
mother
also
would
be
a
citizen.
mr.
charles
gordon
cable
act
of
1922.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
was
not
our
law
though.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
she
might
have
been
a
dual
national
--
mr.
charles
gordon
--
which
is
not
an
uncommon
situation
as
one
knows
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
we‘ve
--
we've
had
perplexing
questions
on
citizenship
on
dual
nationalities
since
we've
had
our
first
nationality
law,
and
we
still
have
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
that's
the
generous
interpretation,
sir
and
i
think
that
maybe
justified
as
i've
said
by
the
fact
that
the
law
regarded
the
family
as
a
unit
and
the
--
the
father
--
mr.
charles
gordon
we're
looking
what
they
--
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
let
--
let
me
show
your
honor
the
legislative
history
and
i
think
this
is
overwhelming
as
to
what
congress
intended.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
think
--
i
think
though
if
you
looked
at
the
four
corners
of
the
1802
act,
you
might
draw
such
a
distinction.
the
1802
act
said,
“the
children
born
abroad
to
persons
who
are
american
citizens
are
citizens,
provided,
the
father
has
previously
resided
in
the
united
states.”
so
such
a
distinction
might
be
made
under
the
1802
law.
the
1874
law
eliminated
that
proviso.
now,
i
--
i'd
like
to
refer
for
a
moment
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
think
is
irrefutable
here.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
as
to
whether
congress
intended
to
confer
citizenship
on
a
child
born
to
an
american
mother
and
an
alien
father
and
here
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
unmistakable.
mr.
charles
gordon
but
then
if
your
honor
will
read
a
little
further,
you'll
see
there's
a
proviso
in
the
1802
act
which
said,
“provided,
citizenship
rights
shall
not
be
sent
to
persons
whose
fathers
never
resided
in
the
united
states.
is
that
in
--
in
our
brief?
i
think
it's
probably
--
we
haven't
got
the
full
statute.
your
honor
look
--
would
look
at
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
1802
act
appears
in
the
--
as
an
appendix
there
and
that
proviso
is
in
it.
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
i'm
talking
about
the
1802
act.
mr.
charles
gordon
this
is
on
page
18,
sir.
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
about
two-thirds
the
way
down
to
the
statute
provided
that
the
right
of
citizenship
shall
not
extend
to
persons
whose
fathers
have
never
resided
within
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
i
--
this
--
this
--
why
the
proviso
was
eliminated?
your
honor,
this
i
think
has
an
explanation.
this
is
--
gets
to
the
crux
of
why
there
were
two
statutes
dealing
with
the
same
subject
matter.
of
course,
we
say
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
intended
two
statutes
enacted
at
the
same
time
containing
inconsistent
conditions
to
operate
prospectively.
the
court
below
said
that
this
--
the
second
clause
was
retained
as
a
savings
clause.
now,
if
the
second
clause
was
intended
to
apply
for
the
future
as
a
method
of
transmitting
citizenship,
then
it
undoubtedly
would
have
continued
this
proviso
or
something
similar.
and
that
is
so
because
in
every
other
law
dealing
with
the
transmission
of
citizenship
by
american
citizens
to
their
children
born
abroad,
every
other
law
since
1790,
congress
has
inserted
a
specific
proviso
precluding
the
transmission
of
citizenship
except
where
the
citizen
parent
had
previously
resided
in
the
united
states.
this
was
true
in
the
1790
law.
it
was
true
in
the
1795,
the
1802,
the
1855
law
and
in
the
revised
statutes
1993,
each
of
which
said
that
citizenship
rights
could
not
be
send
unless
the
father
had
previously
resided
in
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
but
this
is
a
consistent
pattern
of
action
by
congress.
congress
never
has
provided
for
the
transmission
of
citizenship
to
children
born
abroad
unless
the
father
had
some
tie
in
this
country.
congress
wished
to
prevent
the
transmission
of
citizenship
by
generations
of
persons
who
had
never
resided
in
the
united
states.
that
is
the
decision
of
this
court
in
weedin
against
chin
bow.
that's
very
thoroughly
spelled
out.
congress
wanted
to
tie
it,
the
transmission
of
citizenship
to
persons
who
had
been
in
the
united
states.
now,
by
eliminating
this
proviso
in
carrying
forward
the
1802
law
into
section
2172,
it
seems
to
me,
congress
very
clearly
indicated
that
it
didn't
want
this
law
to
have
the
effect
for
which
petitioner
contends.
because
if
it
were
to
operate
prospectively
as
a
means
for
transmitting
citizenship
by
parents
who
were
not
citizens
in
1874,
then
congress
would
have
included
a
proviso
saying
that
citizenship
could
not
--
cannot
be
transmitted
unless
the
parents
has
previously
resided
in
the
united
states.
now,
i
want
--
i
want
to
get
back
for
a
moment
to
the
legislative
history.
on
every
occasion
on
which
this
matter
has
been
considered,
the
legislative
history
tells
us
that
the
revised
statute
18
--
2172
and
its
predecessor
of
1802
were
not
intended
to
confer
rights
of
citizenship
to
children
born
abroad
to
american
mothers
and
alien
fathers.
the
first
such
expression
was
in
connection
with
the
debates
on
the
act
of
1855
and
there
on
page
34
of
our
brief,
we
--
we
quote
from
a
statement
by
congressman
cutting
who
is
the
bill's
sponsor.
this
was
read
by
miss
lavin.
it
says
that,
“we
haven't
gone
as
far
as
england
in
permitting
the
transmission
of
citizenship
to
children
born
abroad
to
american
mothers.”
now,
when
the
next
occasion
arose
which
was
1922,
in
connection
with
the
cable
act,
the
committee
report
which
is
quoted
at
--
at
the
top
of
page
35
of
our
brief
said,
“we
are
not
disturbing
the
citizenship
status
of
children,
those
born
in
this
country
take
under
the
constitution.”
then
the
committee
went
on
to
say
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no,
this
referred
to
exactly
to
1993.
this
did
not
refer
to
2172.
this
referred
to
the
predecessor
of
1993
which
is
the
act
which
we
think
is
controlling,
but
i'm
--
i'm
calling
this
legislative
expressions
to
the
court's
attention
because
they
indicate
that
congress
did
not
wish
to
trans
--
to
permit
the
transmission
of
citizenship
through
a
mother
alone
at
that
time.
the
law
was
changed
in
1934.
now
in
1922
when
congress
was
giving
to
married
woman
additional
right
to
determine
their
own
citizenship,
they
said,
“we
are
not
disturbing
the
law
regarding
the
acquisition
of
citizenship
by
the
children.”
mr.
charles
gordon
35
at
the
top
of
the
page.
those
born
abroad
as
heretofore
the
committee
said,
“take
the
nationality
of
their
mothers.”
then
when
congress
changed
the
law
in
1934,
they
change
it
to
provide
that
citizenship
could
be
transmitted
by
the
father
or
mother.
and
the
committee
report
which
is
also
on
page
35
says,
“by
the
present
law,
citizenship
by
birth
outside
of
the
united
states
is
derived
only
through
the
citizen
father.”
and
then
congress
went
on
to
say
--
the
committees
went
on
to
say,
“the
purpose
of
this
amendment
is
to
establish
complete
equality
between
american
men
and
american
women
in
the
matter
of
transmitting
citizenship.”
now
when
congress
--
when
the
law
was
amended
--
mr.
charles
gordon
it
said
--
the
law
said,
“hereafter,
any
children
hereafter
born
shall
take
citizenship
through
the
father
or
the
mother.”
mr.
charles
gordon
oh,
yes.
that
was
the
act
of
may
24,
1934.
mr.
charles
gordon
i
don't
know
who
proposed
it
but
it
had
--
mr.
charles
gordon
it
had
a
number
of
proposals.
yes,
sir.
these
were
only
two
and
there
were
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
so.
that
was
the
--
the
law
which
amended
--
your
honors
will
note,
i
think
this
might
maybe
of
some
significance
to,
is
determining
whether
congress
then
regarded
section
2172,
the
one
--
the
clause
that
we're
considering
as
being
applicable,
when
congress
amended
the
law
in
1934,
it
amended
only
section
1993.
now,
what
was
the
need
of
amending
section
1993,
if
under
the
law,
previously
in
effect,
either
the
father
or
the
mother
could
transmit?
indeed,
what
was
the
need
for
this
court's
decision
in
weedin
against
chin
bow,
if
either
the
father
or
the
mother
could
have
transmitted
because
the
father
in
that
case
was
a
citizen
who
had
not
resided
previously
in
the
united
states
and
the
court
there
found
that
citizenship
could
not
be
transmitted
through
such
a
father.
now,
we
think
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
they
both
--
they
both
--
this
was
(voice
overlap)
section
--
section
1
of
the
1934.
both
reports
i
think
were
identical.
mr.
charles
gordon
oh
no,
no.
that's
another
portion
of
1934
act,
sir.
that
is
section
2.
section
2
relates
to
the
children
who
acquire
naturalization
through
the
--
natural
--
acquire
citizenship
through
naturalization
or
resumption
by
the
parent.
this
is
section
1
and
there's
no
question
on
what
congress
was
doing
here.
it
was
changing
the
law
and
said,
“child
born
abroad
hereafter
to
a
citizen
mother
or
a
citizen
father
--
and
the
committee
report
says,
“we
intend
to
establish
complete
equality.”
both
--
both
committee
said
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
gordon
now,
i'd
like
to
spend
some
of
my
few
remaining
moments
on
some
of
the
other
aspects
of
the
case.
now,
the
second
claim
which
is
made
here
is
on
the
act
of
march
2,
1907.
the
act
of
march
2,
1907
was
one
of
the
numbers
of
basic
revisions
on
naturalization
and
nationality
laws
from
time
to
time.
it
dealt
primarily
with
expatriation
and
protection
of
citizens
abroad.
section
3
of
that
act
provided
that
an
american
woman
who
married
an
alien,
thereby
lost
her
american
citizenship.
but
congress
wanted
you
to
take
care
of
this
woman
in
the
event
her
marriage
terminated
and
therefore,
congress
said,
“in
the
event
her
marriage
is
terminated,
such
a
woman
may
resume
her
citizenship
in
several
ways
and
one
of
the
ways
she
could
resume
her
citizenship
was
by
returning
to
reside
in
the
united
states.”
we
think
that
also
section
5
is
involved.
section
5
provided
that
a
child
born
abroad
of
alien
parents
would
become
a
citizen
through
the
naturalization
or
resumption
of
citizenship
by
the
mother
during
the
child's
minority.
now,
we
think
that
petitioner's
attempt
to
derive
some
benefit
of
--
from
this
statute
faces
insurmountable
obstacles.
in
the
first
place,
the
statute
speaks
of
a
woman
who
has
lost
her
citizenship
and
permits
such
a
woman
to
resume.
now,
both
sides
here
agree
that
the
mother
here
never
lost
her
citizenship.
she
was
born
a
citizen
and
remains
a
citizen
until
the
present
time.
since
there
was
no
citizenship
lost
here,
there
was
no
citizenship
to
resume.
but
even
more
importantly,
the
statute
speaks
of
a
woman
whose
marriage
has
been
terminated
and
if
the
marriage
is
terminated,
the
statute
says,
“then
the
woman
can
resume
her
citizenship.”
now
here,
the
marriage
has
never
been
terminated.
the
marriage
was
contracted
in
1905
and
the
parties
still
live
together,
they
are
still
husband
and
wife.
the
terms
of
section
3
and
section
5
of
the
1907
act
cannot
come
into
play
unless,
number
one,
there
is
a
loss
of
citizenship;
number
two,
there
is
a
resumption
of
citizenship;
number
three,
there
is
a
termination
of
the
marriage
which
accompanies
results
and
resumption
of
citizenship.
mr.
charles
gordon
we
have
no
problem,
sir.
it
doesn't
apply
here.
mr.
charles
gordon
attorney
general
mitchell
and
--
and
judge
nordbye
in
the
black
case,
were
addressing
an
entirely
different
situation.
that
situation
was
where
there
had
been
a
termination
of
the
marriage,
there
hadn't
been
a
loss
but
there
had
been
a
termination.
now,
attorney
general
mitchell
said,
“now,
here's
an
american
woman
who
hasn't
lost
citizenship
but
her
marriage
in
effect
has
been
terminated,
she
was
divorced.
and
attorney
general
mitchell
said,
”the
--
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
complete
legal
custody
of
the
child
has
been
given
to
the
mother.”
he
says,
“this
is
irrevocable.
if
it
weren't
irrevocable,
i
would've
decided
the
same
--
different
way.”
now,
attorney
general
mitchell
said,
“now,
this
--
this
is
a
--
an
equitable
situation.
here's
a
mother
who
hasn't
lost
her
citizenship,
her
marriage
is
terminated
and
it
is
equitable
for
the
child
to
take
the
same
citizen
--
citizenship
as
the
mother.”
but
that's
an
entirely
different
case
than
this.
the
marriage
has
never
been
terminated.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
statute
provides
for
it.
the
statute
says
that
there
can
be
an
--
a
resumption
of
citizenship
only
when
the
marriage
is
terminated.
that's
the
--
the
only
thing
that
the
statute
was
speaking
of.
mr.
charles
gordon
and
i
agree.
it
is
incongruous
to
confer
greater
rights
on
such
women.
mr.
charles
gordon
but,
your
honor,
the
petitioner's
argument
turns
that
around.
it
is
not
giving
greater
rights
to
an
alien
woman,
it
is
giving
greater
rights
to
a
--
a
citizen
woman
who
has
never
lost
his
citizenship
because
the
alien
woman,
in
order
to
confer
citizenship
on
the
child,
must
first
have
terminated
her
marriage.
and
the
termination
of
the
marriage
creates
a
situation
where
she
is
the
sole
parent
and
she
thereby
is
properly
the
one
who
determines
the
citizenship
of
the
child.
but
the
petitioner's
argument
would
say
that
even
though
the
marriage
was
not
terminated,
even
though
there
are
two
parents
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
will
give
to
this
woman
without
any
benefit
of
statute,
without
any
expression
by
congress,
without
any
support
in
the
constitution,
we
will
give
to
this
woman
what
amounts
to
a
process
of
naturalization.
now,
we
say
such
a
--
an
argument,
such
an
interpretation
gives
to
the
american
woman
not
inferior
rights
but
far
greater
rights
because
it
doesn't
depend
on
a
termination
of
the
marriage.
when
the
marriage
is
terminated,
she
is
the
only
parent.
it
is
right
i
think
to
keep
the
citizenship
of
the
--
of
the
mother
and
the
child
together
at
that
time.
but
at
the
time
when
these
facts
occurred,
congress
said,
“the
only
situation
in
which
we
want
a
mother
to
determine
the
citizenship
of
the
child
is
when
the
marriage
has
terminated
and
she
has
resumed
her
citizenship.”
now
--
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
right,
sir.
congress
has
not
made
any
provision
whether
it
should
have
made
provision
is
another
story.
but
congress
did
and
i
think
congress
deliberately
didn't
want
to
make
a
provision
because
at
that
time,
congress
did
not
wish
the
mother
alone
to
control
the
citizenship
when
there
was
a
father
and
the
father
was
an
alien.
i
think
this
was
deliberate.
mr.
charles
gordon
weedin
against
chin
bow.
mr.
charles
gordon
that
is
exactly
our
argument.
we
say
it
is
inconceivable
in
the
climate
of
those
years,
in
the
climate
of
1802.
mr.
charles
gordon
well,
that
the
--
may
i
answer
it?
the
1934
act
is
quite
similar.
mr.
charles
gordon
that's
right.
mr.
charles
gordon
it
provides
for
the
resumption
that
--
mr.
charles
gordon
the
same
considerations
apply,
sir.
in
order
for
the
person
to
acquire
any
right
under
those
statutes,
the
mother
must
have
been
in
a
position
when
she
resumes
citizenship.
the
resumption
could
take
place
only
in
the
case
of
a
mother
who
lost
or
who
is
in
a
position
of
equal
to
one
who
had
lost
--
provided,
the
marriage
was
terminated
and
the
mother
was
in
effect
the
sole
parent.
now,
if
your
honor
will
read
attorney
general
mitchell's
opinion,
attorney
general
mitchell
laid
very
great
stress
on
the
fact
that
this
was
irrevocable.
that
there
wasn't
any
question
that
the
mother
had
sole
custody
of
the
child.
and
he
said,
“if
there
was
any
question
about
this,
if
the
father
had
any
reserved
right
to
custody,
i
would
not
have
held
the
same
way.”
and
the
reason
he
said
that
i
think
was
in
carrying
out
what
congress
intended
that
a
family
be
considered
as
a
unit
unless
the
unity
had
been
destroyed
and
that
in
a
situation
where
there
was
only
one
parent
and
the
parent
was
the
mother,
it
was
proper
for
the
mother
to
take
the
child,
belong
to
her
in
determining
--
along
with
her
in
determining
citizenship.
this
is
the
only
thing
that
attorney
general
mitchell
decided.
he
did
not
decide
that
in
every
case,
a
child
who
was
born
an
alien
to
a
citizen
mother
would
automatically
become
a
citizen
merely
because
the
mother
took
a
trip
to
the
united
states.
he
decided
only
that
when
the
marriage
had
been
terminated
and
when
the
mother
had
been
given
complete
and
irrevocable
custody
and
thereby
was
the
only
parent
of
that
child,
then
it
was
proper
to
hold
that
the
child
required
the
mother's
citizenship
through,
in
effect,
a
process
of
naturalization.
we
think
that
the
1934
and
the
1907
acts
must
be
read
similarly
in
this
connection.
now,
--
mr.
charles
gordon
he
is
deported
for
having
been
convicted
for
two
crimes
involving
moral
turpitude
and
i'll
tell
your
honor
what
the
crimes
are
if
you
like.
mr.
charles
gordon
the
first
was
when
he
made
a
--
an
application
for
naturalization
in
1930.
he
lied
on
the
question
of
what
arrests
he
had
suffered
and
he
was
convicted
for
lying
in
the
naturalization
proceeding
and
naturalization
was
denied
thereafter.
the
second
was
in
1941
for
assault
with
intent
to
commit
murder
and
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced,
i
believe
for
14
years
in
jail
--
mr.
charles
gordon
no.
he
--
he
was
out
of
jail
by
that
time.
he
was
ill.
mr.
charles
gordon

was
made
by
the
immigration
authorities
based
on
the
manifest.
mr.
charles

the
--
no

is
a
