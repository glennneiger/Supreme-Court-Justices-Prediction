ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
this
action
originated
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
as
a
suit
brought
under
section
360
of
the
nationality
act
of
1952
for
a
judgment
declaring
this
petitioner
who
was
born
of
a
united
states
citizen
mother
and
an
alien
father
born
abroad.
we're
asking
for
the
(inaudible)
judgment
that
he
be
--
be
declared
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
petitioner
is
now
on
the
end
of
55
years
old.
he
was
conceived
in
the
united
states
and
he
has
resided
continuously
in
the
united
states
since
his
entry
at
the
age
of
3
months.
he
is
one
of
six
children
born
to
his
parents
--
the
one
of
six
children
born
to
his
parents
who
was
born
outside
the
continental
limits
of
the
united
states.
his
claim
to
citizenship
rests
on
four
alternative
bases.
the
first
is
under
section
2172
of
the
revised
statutes
of
1874
which
statutes
were
in
effect
at
the
date
of
his
birth
which
provided
that
“children
of
persons
who
are
now
or
have
been
citizens
of
the
united
states
are
to
be
considered
as
citizens.”
the
petitioner's
claim
to
citizenship
in
that
regard
urges
that
the
words
“children
of
persons”
is
to
be
considered
in
the
distributive
as
well
as
in
the
collective
and
the
words
are
now
or
has
been,
is
not
restricted
to
retrospective
application
but
should
in
accordance
with
regular
and
accepted
statutory
construction
be
given
prospective
application.
the
second
basis
concerns
the
interpretation
of
the
act
of
march
2,
1907
which
provided
for
resumption
of
citizenship
by
an
expatriated
parent
and
the
naturalization
of
his
or
her
child
by
such
resumption.
this
was
enacted
subsequent
to
petitioner's
birth
but
it
has
by
--
well,
it
has
been
judicially
determined
to
be
declaratory
of
the
common
law
then
in
existence.
we
urge
that
that
statute
is
not
to
be
given
the
interpretation
of
giving
greater
rights
to
a
former
expatriate
or
to
a
naturalized
person
than
it
does
a
native-born
citizen
of
the
united
states.
and
the
status
of
the
petitioner's
mother,
mrs.
montana,
on
her
return
to
the
united
states
should
not
be
treated
as
less
than
such
an
expatriate
--
an
--
a
former
expatriate
or
a
naturalized
parent.
the
third
basis
is
similar
to
the
second.
it
concerns
the
act
of
may
24th,
1934
which
also
provided
for
the
bestowing
of
citizenship
on
an
alien-born
child
of
a
--
or
a
current
born
child
of
a
united
states
citizen
parent,
or
also
upon
naturalization
of
such
a
parent.
this
statute
again
has
been
judicially
interpreted
as
merely
clarifying
the
uncertainties
in
the
act
of
--
of
march
2,
1907.
this
act,
however,
spells
out
that
the
bestowal
of
citizenship
may
pass
by
--
through
the
citizenship
of
either
the
mother
or
the
father
whereas
in
the
act
of
1907,
it
merely
recited
the
parent.
the
fourth
basis
is
addressed
to
the
equity
powers
of
this
court
and
urges
that
the
government
be
not
allowed
to
avail
itself
of
the
result
of
an
erroneous
instruction
given
by
a
consular
official
to
the
mother
of
the
plaintiff,
who
was
prior
to
the
birth
of
the
child
and
while
awaiting
his
birth,
a
15-year-old
person.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
fairly
simple.
madelyn
montana,
the
petitioner's
mother
was
born
in
new
jersey
in
1890.
she
married
joe
montana
in
1905.
joe,
the
father,
had
been
born
in
italy
but
he
had
for
several
years
prior
to
the
marriage
resided
in
the
united
states.
joe
montana
and
madelyn
montana
left
the
united
states
for
italy
in
1905
--
no,
january
1906.
at
that
time,
madelyn
was
been
about
four
months
pregnant.
she
arrived
in
italy
in
february
of
1906.
by
a
month
and
a
half
after
arriving,
madelyn
went
with
her
mother
to
the
american
consulate
to
obtain
a
passport
for
her
return
home.
the
american
consulate
refused
to
issue
one
to
her
in
her
advanced
state
of
pregnancy.
mrs.
montana,
the
only
witness
at
the
trial
--
trial
testified
that
she
--
he
had
said
to
her,
“lady,
you
cannot
go
in
that
condition.
come
back
after
you
get
your
baby.”
she
resided
in
italy
for
--
with
her
mother
until
the
birth
of
the
plaintiff
on
june
26,
1906.
prior
to
that,
however,
in
march
or
april
of
1906,
joe
montana,
the
husband,
the
father
of
the
petitioner,
returned
to
the
united
states.
again,
madelyn
montana,
testifying,
said
that
she
didn't
know
where
he
was
going,
we
were
on
the
(inaudible)
at
that
time.
after
the
plaintiff's
birth,
she
returned
to
the
american
consulate
and
there
she
obtained
a
passport
for
herself
and
for
her
child.
mauro,
joe
montana
and
her
mother,
mauro
john
montana,
his
mother
and
the
maternal
grandmother,
returned
to
the
united
states
in
september
of
1906
where
he
was
admitted
as
a
united
states
citizen.
the
--
the
parents
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
the
certificate
of
entry
recounted
that
he
was
a
united
states
citizen.
it
said
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
the
petitioner.
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
madelyn
montana,
the
petitioner
and
the
mother
were
met
in
new
york
by
madelyn's
father
who
took
them
to
his
apartment
that
they
owned
in
new
jersey
and
there,
she
and
her
child
resided
for
three
months
with
her
parents.
about
that
time,
madelyn
montana
and
her
husband
apparently
patched
up
their
differences
and
she
went
to
live
with
her
husband
and
they
have
so
lived
from
that
time
to
this
principally
in
the
chicago
area.
the
first
basis
on
which
we
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
no,
sir.
they
were
never
divorced.
the
first
basis
on
which
we
claim
that
mauro
john
montana
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
is
under,
as
i
said,
the
act
of
--
the
revised
statutes
of
1874,
section
2172
thereof.
and
it
is
our
submission
that
the
children
or
persons
who
are
now
or
have
been
citizens
shall
before
without
--
with
outside
the
jurisdiction
and
limits
of
the
united
states
be
considered
citizens,
imports
birth
any
time
during
the
existence
of
that
statute
when
a
united
states
citizen
bore
a
child
abroad.
that
interpretation
provides
for
prospective
application
of
the
statute
and
it
is
in
the
court
with
the
strong
legal
presumption
that
statutes
are
meant
to
operate
prospectively
unless
it
is
made
clear
and
unequivocal
that
retrospective
application
is
to
be
annexed
to
a
statute.
the
seventh
circuit,
in
the
deciding
this
case
in
its
opinion,
expressly
noticed
that
there
was
no
such
limiting
language,
but
suggests
that
the
congress
inadvertently
overlooked
limiting
its
operation
to
retrospective
operation
rather
than
the
accepted
prospective
operation.
that
is
the
--
actually
the
basis
for
the
decision
adverse
to
the
petitioner
on
this
point
in
the
seventh
circuit.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
strong
legal
presumption
directing
prospective
application
should
not
be
overcome
by
imputing
inadvertence
to
the
legislature.
we
also
make
the
further
suggestion
that
the
words
“are
now
or
have
been
citizens”
are
not
such
strong,
clear
and
imperative
words
using
the
language
of
the
cases
out
of
this
court
as
to
reject
the
interpretation
that
they
relate
to
a
time
contemporaneous
with
satisfaction
of
the
provisions
of
the
act,
that
is
sometime
between
1874
and
1934
when
a
child
of
a
united
states
citizen
was
born
abroad.
in
our
brief,
we
set
forth
--
forth
at
page
a
10
series
of
cases
where
the
word
“now
in
statutes”
has
been
so
interpreted.
that
is
to
a
time
contemporaneous
with
the
satisfaction
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
its
--
in
accordance
with
such
approved
interpretation
that
we
submit
that
the
word
“now
in
the
act”
speaks
as
of
a
time
when
a
person
in
such
as
mrs.
montana,
who
is
a
united
states
native-born
citizen,
has
a
child
born
abroad
any
time
between
1874
and
1934.
the
source
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
no,
sir,
there's
not.
at
least
my
record
--
my
memory
does
not
recall
--
there's
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
record
of
the
proceedings
certainly.
i'm
trying
to
think
of
whether
there
was
any
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
or
anything
to
that
effect
and
i
don't
recall
any.
however,
the
--
the
main
source
of
resistance
to
the
prospective
application
for
which
--
why
--
which
we
urge
upon
this
court
has
its
source
of
an
article
written
by
a
man
by
the
name
of
horace
binney
relating
to
the
preceding
act
of
1802.
the
act
of
1802
was
substantially
the
same
as
this
act
of
1874
providing
similarly
children
of
persons
who
are
now
or
have
been
citizens
shall
be
born
abroad
be
deemed
citizens
but
added
a
proviso
that
in
order
for
that
act
to
become
operative,
there
was
a
requirement
of
united
states
residence
by
the
fathers
of
such
children.
that
does
not
occur
in
the
act
of
--
in
section
2172.
mr.
binney
said
that
are
now
was
--
spoke
as
of
the
date
of
enactment
referring
to
the
act
of
1802
and
he
said
that
was
april
14,
1902
and
that
was
when
its
benefit
stopped
and
with
that
interpretation,
he
spoke
of
the
said
plaintiff
foreign-born
children
of
citizens
and
it,
he
writing
in
1854,
indicated
that
there
had
been
no
law
to
cover
this
people
during
that
entire
15
to
--
52
years.
this
court
--
this
court
subsequently,
in
united
states
versus
wong
kim
ark
and
in
weedin
versus
chin
bow
at
least
passively
accepted
the
interpretation
put
on
that
act
by
mr.
binney.
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
in
both
of
these
cases
or
shall
i
say
neither
of
them,
the
specific
point
here
was
not
an
issue.
further
--
i
would
say
further
complicating
the
problem
on
retrospective
whereas
prospective
application.
the
congress
in
1855
passed
a
law
declaring
children
theretofore
born
or
thereafter
born
outside
the
continental
limits
of
fathers
who
were
united
states
citizens
were
declared
to
be
citizens.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
1855,
yes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
there
has
been
--
i
think
in
chin
bow,
this
court
indicated
that
it
looked
like
that
was
what
happened,
yes.
there
was,
however,
no
repeal
of
the
act
of
1802
and
the
argument
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
suggests
inherently
that
this
act
of
1855
was
the
repealer
of
the
act
of
1802
and
that
the
act
of
1855
applied
exclusively
to
children
of
united
states
citizens
born
abroad.
but
unfortunately
for
that
interpretation,
congress
in
1874
substantially
re-enacted
the
act
of
1802
as
the
section
2172
under
which
we
claim
--
we
--
which
we
make
this
claim
of
citizens
--
citizenship.
here
of
course,
there
was
the
--
and
there
was
no
longer
the
requirement
of
prior
united
states
citizen
–
residence,
but
aside
from
that,
the
acts
were
the
same.
in
further
urging,
as
we
do
prospective
application,
the
revised
statute
set
forth
the
duties
of
the
commissioners
in
enacting
the
revised
statutes
and
they
said
that
their
duties
were
to
revise,
simplify,
arrange,
and
consolidate
all
statutes
of
the
united
states
general
and
permanent
in
nature
which
shall
be
enforced
at
the
time
that
these
commissioners
completed
their
duties.
we
submit
that
--
that
the
duties,
thus
spelled
out,
statutes
general
and
permanent
in
nature
and
those
statutes
which
--
which
shall
be
enforced
at
that
time
they
conclude
their
--
their
duties
is
an
adoption
of
prospective
application
because
in
1874,
72
years
after
the
1802
act,
we
have
a
re-enactment
of
the
same
statute
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
there
was
--
it
--
it
was
spelled
out
in
the
act
that
this
was
a
repeal
of
all
former
statutes.
the
--
it
was
a
revision.
it
was
--
it
was
all
the
things
we're
saying.
it
was
a
revision,
it
was
simplification.
it
was
an
arrangement.
it
was
a
consolidation
but
nonetheless,
it
only
applied
to
statutes
then
enforced.
it
only
applied
to
statutes
that
were
general
and
permanent.
and
as
this
court
well
knows,
there
were
some
500
amendments
after
that
culling
out
the
ones
that
were
surplus.
this
one
did
not
fall
by
the
waist
side.
so
apparently,
the
--
the
court
or
the
legislature
and
the
court
--
courts
considered
this
general
and
permanent
in
--
in
its
nature.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
--
i
interpret
and
urge
the
interpretation
that
“who
are
now”
refers
to
any
time
between
1874
and
the
repeal
of
the
act
of
1874
and
1934.
i
--
i
interpret
and
urge
the
interpretation
that
now
refers
to
any
time
when
the
requirements
--
requirements
of
the
statute
coincide
between
those
two
periods,
between
--
in
the
52
years,
between
those
periods.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
--
i
don't
think
surplusage
sir.
i
--
i
would
rather
say
that
now
refers
to
a
time
during
the
pendency
of
the
act
and
so
has
been
interpreted
in
the
cases
that
we
--
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
we
would
read
it
the
same
way.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don't
think.
of
course,
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
remarks
of
the
--
of
the
legislature
at
that
time
relative
to
what
they
did
mean.
i
don't
think
that
the
words
are
so
imperative
as
to
require
that
interpretation
and
i
think
that
is
the
rule
that
--
that
binds
us.
i
--
i
suggested
in
my
reply
brief
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
refers
to
persons
born
and
it
refers
to
a
--
a
matter
accomplished,
persons
born
in
the
united
states
shall
be
considered
citizens.
that
--
that
is
just
as
clearly
a
word
denoting
past
tense
or
present
tense
as
are
the
words
“are
now”
and
this
statute
continues.
it
says
persons
who
have
been
citizens,
children
of
persons
who
have
been
citizens.
in
the
next
proceeding
section
of
--
or
the
next
proceeding
clause
of
2172,
we
have
children
of
persons
who
have
been
naturalized.
that
has
been
consistently
interpreted
to
--
to
be
prospective
in
applications.
i
--
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
--
these
--
these
words
are
not
the
type
of
imperative
words
that
will
make
us
breakaway
from
the
general
rule
of
prospective
application
to
our
statutes.
now,
at
the
same
time
--
at
the
same
time
in
1874,
congress
re-enacted
this
act
of
1855
as
section
1993.
not
withstanding
the
simultaneous
re-enactment,
it
is
again
the
position
of
the
government
that
1993
is
the
exclusive
statute
applying
to
foreign-born
children
of
united
states
citizen
parents.
that
--
their
urging
of
course
found
response
in
the
seventh
circuit
decision
which
is
now
before
this
court.
and
it
--
it's
our
position
and
our
urging
upon
this
court
that
that
argument
stands
on
several
faulty
bases.
first,
it
in
--
in
repeals
2172
and
a
statute
simultaneously
enacted
and
of
course,
the
people
statute
and
it
compels
the
retrospective
application
of
a
re-enacted
statute,
contrary
to
every
basic
principle
of
a
statutory
construction.
it
also
ignores
the
duty
of
the
commissioners
to
re-enact
statutes
general
and
permanent
in
character.
the
argument
seems
to
strain
to
divest
in
the
face
of
the
accepted
law.
it
strains
to
divest
citizenship
when
all
facts
in
law
are
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
claim
for
citizenship.
the
second
phase
of
our
argument
with
regard
to
section
2172
brings
us
to
the
interpretation
of
children
of
persons.
we
submit
that
that
is
to
include
the
distributive
--
a
child
of
a
person
as
well
as
children
of
persons.
our
principle
reliance
in
that
regard
is
found
in
the
revised
statutes
themselves.
section
1
of
the
revised
statute
says
that
in
determining
the
meaning
of
words
--
the
plural
number
may
include
the
singular.
the
--
there
is
a
further
basis
for
our
suggestion
although
i
do
think
that
in
itself
is
sufficient.
the
further
basis
is
that
the
next
preceding
clause,
the
first
clause
of
2172,
we
rely
on
the
second,
has
been
interpreted
many
times,
many
times
to
apply
to
the
distributive
that
is
a
child
of
a
person.
the
respondent's
argument
ignores
the
provisions
of
section
1
allowing
the
interpretation
as
including
the
distributive
and
explains
the
cases
themselves
as
meaning
applying
in
the
singular
only
when
the
--
one
of
the
--
the
alien
parent
is
dead
or
is
completely
divorced
from
the
citizen
parent
and
the
citizen
parent
has
custody
of
the
child.
i
--
i
suggest
that
they
had
argument
--
rewrites
the
statute.
we
find
nothing
in
the
statute
that
provides
that
this
only
applies
to
the
distributive
when
the
alien
parent
is
dead
or
when
the
alien
parent
is
divorced.

he
is
still
an
alien,
an
alien
resident
of
the
united
states.
along
with
this
--
this
argument
for
the
interpretation
by
the
distributive
or
as
a
distributive,
we
--
we
get
assistance
from
the
source
where
we
get
a
lack
of
assistance
in
the
other
phase
of
our
argument
and
that
is
mr.
binney.
mr.
binney
expressed
some
shock
at
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
--
and
stated
--
stated
a
realization
that
the
clear
wording
of
the
statute
would
pass
citizenship
through
a
mother.
he
said
that
those
words
maybe
understood
as
also
being
used
distributively
to
comprehend
any
person
whether
father
or
mother
and
thus,
to
make
the
child
of
an
alien
father
and
a
citizen
mother
a
citizen.
the
respondent's
attempt
to
restrict
this
to
both
parents
would
--
would
have
to,
i
suggest,
fail
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
section
1
allows
the
distributive.
if
there
is
any
reason
why
the
distributive
should
not
be
applied
here,
i
suggest
that
it's
on
the
--
the
respondent
to
show
a
good
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be.
i
also
suggest
that
this
matter
of
the
parents
being
dead
or
divorced,
the
alien
parent
being
dead
--
dead
or
divorced
finds
no
support
in
--
in
common
sense.
whatever
be
the
estrangement
of
the
parents,
that's
still
the
child
of
the
parents.
it's
--
it's
rather
unusual
that
the
immigration
law
itself
presently
operative
says
that
the
--
the
child
shall
also
include
a
post
jewish
child.
i
--
i
suggest
that
on
that
point,
all
fact
in
law
is
contrary
to
the
government's
contention
in
this
regard.
the
third
of
our
four
alternatives
concerns
the
act
of
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
--
rather
the
second
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but
i
--
i
can
give
what
i
think
is
the
--
a
fair
answer.
it
suggests
itself
in
the
government's
brief.
at
page
34,
the
government
has
quoted
congressman
cutting
who
proposed
the
1955
legislature.
and
congressman
cutting
said
in
the
reign
of
victoria
in
the
year
1844,
the
english
parliament
provided
that
the
children
of
english
mothers,
though
married
to
foreigners,
should
have
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
english
subjects,
though
born
out
of
allegiance.
i
have
not,
in
this
bill,
gone
to
that
extent
as
the
house
will
observe
from
the
reading
of
it.
now,
that
in
itself,
being
read
by
itself
is
rather
ominous,
but
yesterday
through
the
facilities
of
your
library,
i
pulled
out
the
--
the
legislature
during
the
time
of
victoria
in
the
--
in
the
year
1844.
this
reads
rather
unusually.
it
--
just
prior
to
this
section
to
which
he
refers,
it
says
that
native-born
british
subjects
shall
be
able
to
hold
land,
they
shall
be
able
to
own
personal
property,
they
shall
be
able
to
hold
certain
offices
very
similar
to
the
provisions
that
we
have
under
our
constitution
as
the
precedent
who
must
be
native
born.
the
next
succeeding
section
is
the
section
to
which
he
refers.
the
next
succeeding
section
says
that
the
child
of
a
united
states
--
of
united
states
say,
the
child
of
a
british
mother,
though
born
out
of
allegiance
shall
inherit
all
the
--
what
is
this,
the
rights
and
privileges
of
english
subjects.
the
consecutiveness
of
the
section
would
seem
to
appear
that
such
a
woman
would
be
able
to
pass
unto
her
child
the
rights
of
a
native-born
child
including
the
right
to
hold
the
offices
that
a
native-born
child
would
have.
mr.
congressman
cutting
said,
“i
haven't
gone
to
that
extent
in
this
bill.”
and
so
he
has
not
because
in
the
re-enactment
in
1874,
you
will
find
that
2172
under
which
we
are
now
before
this
court
is
listed
under
naturalization.
and
2172
says
that
those
children
will
be
deemed
citizens.
1993,
the
re-enactment
of
the
act
of
a
1855
is
listed
under
citizenship.
and
it
says
that
those
persons
shall
be
declared
citizens.
the
guest
versus
perkins
case
urged
that
mr.
guest
was
in
fact
a
native-born
citizen
entitled
to
all
the
rights
and
privileges
of
a
native-born
citizen
and
while
they
never
really
got
too
far
because
he
had
--
his
father
had
not
had
the
five
years
residence,
the
--
the
relationship
i
think
is
there
that
children
under
1993
are
to
be
considered
as
native-born
citizens.

on

i
don't
remember
too
but
i
do
think
that
that
is
the
great
--
great
distinction
here.
here,
we
have
2172
under
naturalization,
1993
under
citizenship.
i
think
there
is
a
--
a
great
distinction.
i
think
we
also
have
the
words
“be
deemed”
under
2172
and
declared
citizens
under
1993.
i
think
a
distinction
was
intended
and
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
perhaps
someday,
this
court
will
see
the
determination
of
whether
a
distinction
was
intended.
going
on
then
to
the
act
of
march
2,
1907,
that
was
enacted
about
six
months
after
--
with
no
more
than,
about
nine
months
after
the
birth
of
the
petitioner.
this
act
provided
that
a
child
born
abroad
should
be
deemed
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
the
naturalization
or
resumption
of
american
citizen
--
citizenship
by
the
parent.
the
court
will
note
that
no
provision
--
no
provision
at
all
was
made
for
the
child
born
abroad
of
a
citizen
parent,
though
i
am
sure
that
the
congress
was
aware
that
there
was
such
a
class
of
persons.
i
think
we
--
we
can
impute
to
the
congress
a
realization
that
the
situation
did
exist
and
i
think
that
we
can
also
--
impute
to
them
an
interpretation
that
no
provision
was
necessary
that
such
children
were
in
fact
automatically
bestowed
with
the
citizenship
of
the
citizen
parent.
the
district
court
of
minnesota
in
a
like
situation,
the
petitioner,
black,
recognized
that
the
citizen
mother
was
not
provided
for.
but
that
court
held
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
she
was
in
the
same
position
and
as
a
woman
resuming
citizenship
or
being
the
current
or
at
being
naturalized
and
that
her
children
should
be
likewise
made
citizens
of
the
united
states
upon
her
return
to
the
united
states.
the
--
there
was
of
course
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
termination
of
the
marital
relation
with
the
alien
father.
the
attorney
general,
in
one
of
his
opinions
in
cole,
erie,
picard
came
to
the
same
conclusion.
the
resistance
of
the
respondent
is
first,
that
the
act
was
not
made
law
until
subsequent
to
the
plaintiff's
birth.
the
district
of
--
the
district
court
of
michigan
had
occasion
to
entertain
just
that
question.
it
was
the
district
curt
of
michigan
and
petitioner
tries
to
say
that
this
act
was
declaratory
in
the
common
law.
the
termination
of
the
marriage
relationship
that
is
provided
for
in
this
statute
as
necessary
to
enforcement
of
the
act
has
been
satisfied
by
much
less
than
the
absolute
divorce
for
which
the
respondent
contends.
in
u.s.
ex
rel
guest
versus
perkins,
there
was
a
separation
agreement
between
the
parties
and
the
court
found
that
to
be
sufficient.
here,
we
have
the
parents
who
were
actually
separated
before
the
child's
birth.
he
was
in
the
absolute
and
sole
custody
of
his
mother,
both
at
the
time
his
birth
and
for
a
limited
time
thereafter.
we
suggest
that's
directly
within
first
(inaudible)
case
and
the
black
case
and
the
guest
case
except
for
the
formality
of
the
document.
the
respondent
nonetheless
contends
that
the
later
reconciliation
of
the
parents
divested
this
citizenship
if
he
took
it
and
does
not
inform
us
of
how
that
did
occur
and
certainly,
there's
no
provision
in
law
for
its
occurrence.
it's
our
submission
on
this
point
that
the
sole
actual
custody
in
the
--
in
the
citizen
parent
and
the
return
to
the
united
states
for
permanent
residence
coinciding
that
the
petitioner
just
--
thus
became
a
citizen
under
the
provisions
of
the
act
of
march
2,
1907
and
that
only
by
his
own
act
could
he
divest
his
citizenship.
in
1934
we
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
in
accordance
with
the
decisions
in
--
in
the
petitioner
black
case
and
of
the
attorney
general's
opinion
in
cole-picard,
both
of
which
are
incorporated
in
our
brief.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
don't
know,
sir.
i
don't
know.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i
hope
so.[laughs]
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
we
have
a
--
a
third
basis
on
which
we
claim
citizenship
and
in
that
regard,
we
suggest
the
same
argument
we've
just
presented
to
the
court
in
the
light
of
the
act
of
may
24th,
1934.
that
provided
for
the
bestowal
of
citizenship
upon
the
minor
child
of
a
mother
or
a
father
who
resumes
citizenship
or
who
was
naturalized.
it
eliminates
the
necessary
determination
of
the
marital
relationship.
it
does
require
however,
five
years
residence
by
the
child
which
we're
--
we'll
able
to
satisfy.
in
--
in
interpreting
this
act,
act
of
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
in
--
as
i
was
saying,
in
the
petitioner
black,
the
--
the
district
court,
i
believe
in
massachusetts
found
that
there
was
no
reason
why
this
woman
who
is
in
the
same
position
as
an
expatriate
or
resuming
citizenship
or
a
person
taking
natural
--
being
naturalized
where
there
was
no
--
where
there
was
no
real
distinction
to
all
practical
purposes,
she
should
get
the
benefit
of
the
act
and
actually,
in
that
case,
did.
and
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
in
the
cole-picard
--
well,
in
his
opinion,
is
precisely
the
same
that
there
is
no
reason
to
restrict
that
--
that
grant
of
citizenship
to
resumption
and
to
naturalization.
that
actually,
everything
else
being
present,
return
to
--
to
residence
and
the
then
present
united
states
citizenship,
that
woman
should
also
be
able
to
pass
on
that
right
to
her
child.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
as
i
read
it,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
as
i
read
it,
the
failure
to
provide
for
those
people,
united
states
citizens,
who
return
for
residence,
indicates
a
recognition
in
the
legislature
that
no
provision
was
needed
that
their
children
automatically
were
citizens,
but
that
--
that
aside,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
such
a
person
who
has
never
been
expatriated,
who'd
--
who
is
not
a
naturalized
citizen
but
a
native-born
citizens
who'd
certainly
have
at
least
the
rights
that
are
accorded,
the
former
expatriate
and
the
naturalized
citizen.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i'm
--
i
also
rely
upon
judicial
interpretation
and
the
sole
--
sole
example
of
judicial
interpretation
is
the
petitioner
black
case
and
i
urge
that
interpretation
upon
the
court.
i
--
also,
we
have
the
interpretation
by
the
attorney
general,
the
head
of
the
department
of
immigration
who
--
who
also
so
interpreted
the
--
the
act.

and

ms.
anna

anna
r.
lavin
it's

op.
atty.
gen.,
page
90
and
it
was
indeed
mr.
mitchell.
now,
in
urging
the
--
the
act
of
1934
made
law
some
28
years
subsequent
to
the
birth
of
this
child.
we
ask
the
court
to
employ
the
same
interpretation
that
it
employed
in
the
case
of
kelly
versus
owen,
74
u.s.
476.
the
act
of
1934
says
that
the
children
of
--
foreign-born
children
of
the
united
states
mother
or
father
will
be
deemed
citizens
of
the
united
states
on
the
performance
of
the
required
residence.
the
--
in
kelly
versus
owen,
we
had
a
similar
provision
that
said
“women
or
woman
married
to
or
who
shall
be
married
to
a
united
states
citizen
shall
be
deemed
a
citizen.”
this
court
said
that
the
term
“married”
didn't
refer
to
a
married
ceremony
being
celebrated,
but
to
a
state
of
marriage
and
therefore,
it
applied
as
well
to
the
persons
who
had
been
married
before,
the
persons
to
be
married
subsequently
and
under
that
interpretation,
applying
that
interpretation
to
this
act,
we
ask
that
it
merely
--
it
be
interpreted
as
being
declaratory
of
a
state
in
which
this
petitioner
was
in.
that
is
that
he
was
the
child
of
a
united
states
citizen
born
abroad
and
is
therefore
--
and
therefore,
shall
be
deemed
a
citizen.
our
final
contention
is
that
the
respondent
is
estopped
from
asserting
petitioner's
birth
abroad
as
an
impediment
to
his
citizenship.
we
urge
that
the
refusal
of
a
passport
to
the
petitioner's
mother
so
that
she
might
bear
in
the
united
states
a
child
that
had
been
conceived
in
the
united
states
and
hope
that
for
the
first
three
months
of
its
life
has
always
lived
in
the
united
states
that
--
that
that
erroneous
instruction
can't
be
relied
on
as
a
basis
for
alienage.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes.
the
government's
claim
is
that
she
didn't
need
a
passport.
the
government's
argument
continues
that
if
she
needed
a
passport
for
internal
reasons
in
foreign
country,
she
would
be
given
a
passport
to
as
a
--
ensuring
the
protection
of
the
united
states
afar.
the
fact
is
that
this
record
shows
that
after
the
child
born
--
was
born,
she
was
given
a
passport
which
would
indicate
that
in
fact
she
did
need
one.
now,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
and
this
was
a
--
i
might
say
a
belated
argument,
raised
only
that
appeal
in
the
seventh
circuit,
but
the
--
the
inference
from
the
circumstances,
the
fact
that
she
would
get
a
passport
if
she
needed
one
and
the
fact
that
she
did
get
one
indicates
that
she
did
need
one.
beyond
that
--
beyond
that,
the
record
doesn't
go
nor
am
i
at
this
time
able
to
go
because
the
point
was
not
brought
out
during
the
time
that
we
were
taking
testimony
on
this.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
at
that
time,
there
seems
no
doubt
that
you
just
got
on
a
boat
if
you
want
to
leave
the
united
states.
your
problems,
as
i
understand,
arose
when
you
were
in
these
various
foreign
countries,
more
in
getting
out
of
there
than
getting
out
of
here.
actually,
aside
from
that,
the
two
basis
of
resistance
that
the
government
gives
to
this
argument
is
a
suggestion
that
the
trial
judge
didn't
seem
to
believe
mrs.
montana.
there's
--
there's
no
indication
of
that
in
the
record.
they
--
every
indication
in
the
record
is
faking
all
the
story.
the
basis
for
my
decision
is
that
the
father
wasn't
citizen
and
that's
all.
so
there
is
no
--
no
reason
for
making
such
suggestion
or
an
argument
at
this
time.
at
--
the
government
always
--
also
suggest
that,
”lady,
you
can't
go
in
that
condition.
you
come
back
when
you
get
your
baby”
was
merely
a
suggestion,
an
indication
that
he
was
concerned
with
her
health.
i
--
i
suggest
to
the
court,
it
certainly
doesn't
sound
like
a
suggestion
and
it
certainly
would
not
have
the
impact
of
a
suggestion
for
a
15-year
old
girl
away
from
her
home
and
in
a
foreign
country
reliance
upon
the
counsel
to
give
her
aid
and
protection.
we
--
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
here
is
a
citizen
by
virtue
of
any
of
the
four
arguments
we
urge.
and
we
also
urge
upon
this
court
to
reverse
this
case
and
remand
it
with
a
--
with
instructions
for
an
appropriate
judgment
to
accord
the
--
the
petitioner
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
thank
you.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
i'd
like
to
refer
first
to
what
mr.
gordon
refers
to
as
the
overwhelming
congressional
background
on
the
act
of
this
before
the
court
in
the
form
of
2172.
i
--
i'd
like
to
just
go
down
that
because
we
have
been
impressed
by
how
overwhelming
this
was.
we
have
mr.
grover's
edition
of
kent's
commentaries
in
1826,
20
years
after
the
--
after
the
--
an
act
of
mr.
binney
in
1854,
again,
50
years
after
they
enact.
we
have
this
court's
two
decisions
to
which
i
referred
when
the
issue
was
not
before
the
court
and
that
about
covers
it.
there
was
nothing
contemporaneous
with
the
re-enactment
in
1874.
congressman
cutting's
remark
i
think
i
discussed
at
length
at
the
--
in
my
earlier
argument
and
i
hope
i
distinguished
them
because
that
is
not
in
fact
what
congressman
cutting
said.
what
he
said
was
with
relation
to
the
acts
under
the
reign
of
victoria
in
1844
and
the
distinction
of
the
natural-born
citizen
against
a
--
a
manner
of
naturalization.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
--
the
latter
--
the
former
is
also
subject
to
divestment
which
they
could
never
do
with
a
--
a
native-born
citizen.
those
are
the
only
ones
that
occurr
to
me
immediately.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
a
native-born
citizen?
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh,
expatriation,
of
course.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
of
course.
that
again
slipped
my
mind.
actually,
the
only
thing
that
does
occur
to
me
was
the
--
the
provision
relative
to
holding
office
by
a
--
a
native
born.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
that
--
that
was
the
thing
that
immediate
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
--
presidency
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes.
but
--
of
course,
in
the
--
in
the
laws
under
victoria,
we
had
the
problem
of
holding
property
that
they
referred
to
more
completely
but
that
does
not
--
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
obtained
in
any
state.
we
have
a
--
in
this,
i've
urged
upon
the
court.
i
--
i
think
that
in
my
argument,
i
indicated
these
expressions
of
mr.
binney,
an
eminent
scholar.
this
court's
appear
it
--
approbation
of
that
expression
but
what
i
do
try
to
urge
upon
this
court
is
that
what
later
congressmen
might
have
said.
what
--
what
scholars
might
have
said
are
--
are
not
to
be
conclusive
in
this
determination.
this
court
--
a
--
a
judicial
tribunal
is
the
only
one
who
has
the
right
to
determine
the
effect
of
statute
and
that
is
when
the
proper
triad
case
arises
and
that
is
what
now
is
before
this
court.
now,
i
noticed
that
there
was
practically
no
argument
on
--
addressed
to
the
distributive
except
the
fact
that
between
1855
and
1874,
we
had
a
situation
where
a
wife
took
the
nationality
of
her
husband.
in
our
brief,
we
have
--
in
our
reply
brief,
we
have
taken
this
argument
of
mr.
gordon
and
we
put
it
in
what
i
--
in
what
i
think
is
its
proper
posture.
if
a
--
if
a
man
passed
citizenship
to
his
wife
by
the
fact
of
the
act
of
1854,
then
there
was
actually
no
necessity
for
the
act
to
1855.
but
if
we
had
a
man
passing
his
nationality
to
his
wife,
then
we
had
a
child
who
was
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
that
wipes
out
the
requirement
of
the
five
years
residence
by
the
father.
actually,
the
incongruity
of
the
two
of
them
is
--
is
obvious
from
that
posture
as
well
as
from
what
mr.
gordon
urges
as
an
incongruity
in
the
subsistence
of
both
statutes
only
in
the
inverse
rather
than
in
the
way
i
suggest.
i
want
to
get
to
this
1907
argument,
the
termination
quite
particularly.
mr.
gordon
does
not
seem
to
credit
the
guest
case
where
a
--
a
document,
a
contract
between
the
two
parties
that
one
of
them
would
have
custody
of
the
child
was
sufficient.
there
was
no
termination
of
that
marriage,
there
was
a
--
a
contractual
arrangement
between
the
parties.
also,
mr.
--
the
attorney
general,
mr.
mitchell,
it
was
his
expression
that
we
must
remember
that
custody
isn't
permanent
despite
the
fact
that
mr.
gordon's
argument
is
that
he
would
never
made
the
--
the
contention
that
are
--
he
would
never
have
followed
this
decision
unless
custody
were
permanent.
but
mr.
mitchell
himself
said,
“we
must
recognize
the
custody
is
not
always
necessarily
permanent.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
are
cases
where
the
father
was
given
legal
custody
and
the
child
still
took
the
nationality
of
his
mother.
we
--
in
the
1934
act
though,
we
must
remember
that
no
termination
was
required.
mr.
gordon
concedes
the
black
and
--
black
decision.
he
concedes
the
opinion
of
mr.
mitchell
in
cole-picard
and
if
no
termination
was
required
under
the
1934
act,
then
the
declaration
of
kelly
--
kelly
versus
--
the
aspect
in
which
kelly
versus
owen
was
decided
by
this
court
would
make
mr.
montana
a
citizen.
i
--
i
think
there
is
--
i
--
i
think
and
i
have
urged
in
--
on
the
seventh
circuit
as
well
as
this
court
that
the
suggestion
of
mr.
gordon
that
mrs.
montana's
testimony
wasn't
credible.
that
mrs.
montana's
testimony
was
not
to
be
believed
at
this
--
at
the
appeal
level
because
she
was
an
interested
witness,
does
not
find
any
basis
in
the
record
and
what
he
asked
this
court
to
do
is
to
make
a
finding
of
fact.
i
have
set
out
in
my
reply
brief
every
utterance
of
the
court
relative
to
his
acceptance
of
that
testimony.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
any
incongruity
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
discounted
her
testimony
because
of
what
was
obviously
be
an
interested
of
a
mother.
the
--
the
question
of
his
refusal
of
the
passport
for
a
time
has
had
i
think
a
--
a
reasonable
corollary
in
the
many
cases
that
were
before
this
court
and
other
courts
of
the
united
states
where
a
foreign-born
child
of
american
citizens
had
tried
to
come
into
the
this
country
by
the
time
they
reached
their
16th
birthday
in
order
that
they
might
complete
their
five
years
residence
while
they
were
still
minors.
that
has
been
consistently
found
to
estop
the
government
from
raising
the
manner
of
not
conforming
to
that
that
five
year
requirement.
though
the
children
were
no
in
here
at
the
time
and
the
statute
required
five
years
residence
before
they
attain
their
majority,
the
fact
that
the
american
consul
had
held
up
there
passports
was
determined
to
be
no
impediment
to
their
citizenship.
mr.
chief
justice
referred
to
the
certificate
--
certificate
of
arrival.
i
think
it
is
a
reasonable
inference
from
the
record
that
this
--
certificate
of
--
of
arrival
was
founded
on
some
determination
that
the
certificate
of
arrival
was
actually
a
official
document
by
an
official
officer
of
the
united
states
government
and
should
be
given
some
credit
in
that
regard.
