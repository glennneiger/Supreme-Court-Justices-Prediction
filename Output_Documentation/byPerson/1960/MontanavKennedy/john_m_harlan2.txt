but
effect
of
that
argument
where
he
is
to
read
the
resumption
of
american
citizenship
as
being
a
resumption
of
the
residence?
justice
john
m.

that's
attorney
general
mitchell's
opinion?
justice
john
m.

he
took
your
views.
justice
john
m.

yes.
justice

where
is

justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
but
in
his
opinion
as
i
understand
it
correctly
said
that
it
was
incongruous
to
suppose
that
congress
wanted
to
confer
greater
rights
to
the
children
of
american
women
who
had
lost

children
of

women
who
had
never
lost

justice
john
m.
harlan
the
attorney's
general

is
not

reference
to
the
1907
act,
it
was
in
reference
to
the
1934
act
and
those
considerations
have
changed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it's
identical
in
that
respect.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
