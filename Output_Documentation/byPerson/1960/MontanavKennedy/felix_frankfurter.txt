presidency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
about
the
presidency?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
a
child
born
in
italy
could
become
the
president
under
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gordon,
i'm
all
for
a
counsel,
who
restricts
himself
to
the
case
that
–
that's
before
the
court
and
no
speculations
and
(inaudible)
outside
of
it
or
even
to
answer
outside
it,
but
i
do
think
the
question
of
whether
your
view
of
the
argument
about
the
validity
or
the
acceptability
of
--
of
the
mother's
testimony,
i
do
think
the
question
whether
if
that
isn't
--
if
that
is
maybe
subject
of
discussion
or
the
difference
of
opinion,
i
do
think
the
question
whether
the
consul's
conduct
could
estop,
is
relevant
to
the
determination
of
this
case.
this
--
the
estoppel
argument
assumes
that
the
statutory
material,
the
statutory
requirements,
the
statutory
basis
for
finding
citizenship,
precludes
the
finding
of
citizenship
and
that
--
and
that
despite
that
fact,
there's
an
estoppel
against
the
united
states
to
raise
the
exclusionary
provisions
of
the
statute.
i
do
think
that
that's
relevant
to
your
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
going
to
argue
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
this
moment
but
are
you
going
to
deal
whether
any
consul
has
the
power
to
estop
an
act
of
congress
not
being
enforced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
don't
want
you
to
--
i
just
want
to
know
whether
you
will
argue
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
a
estoppel
--
estoppel
implies
conduct
outside
of
what
is
necessary
and
somebody
does
something
which
the
law
recognizes
as
creating
a
situation
that
forecloses
an
objection
to
the
consequences
of
that
action
flowing.
that's
what
i
understand
estoppel
to
be.
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
on
the
assumption
for
the
admirable
argument
of
petitioner's
counsel,
dealt
with
last,
namely,
after
all
the
statutory
or
legal
provisions,
are
against
it.
she
says,
“they
can't
be
raised
here”
because
of
the
conduct
of
that
--
of
the
--
of
a
consul
and
i
do
think
that
is
relevant,
very
important
as
i
see
it,
for
the
government
to
take
a
position
on
this
question
to
estoppel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
those
observations
that
you've
just
made
are
--
are
a
way
of
saying
there
couldn't
be
estoppel,
but
if
there
could
be
a
estoppel,
if
the
consul
in
fact
dissuaded
a
lady
from
coming
here
and
thereby
having
a
child
born
here,
whether
he
had
power
to
do
that
that,
whether
she
needed
a
passport,
whether
the
italian
law
required
the
passport,
all
those
things
are
immaterial
if
a
representation
by
an
american
official
to
a
woman
in
her
situation
made
her
change
her
position,
whereby
the
child
was
born
in
italy
instead
of
in
the
united
states.
if
that
could
create
an
estoppel,
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
that
was
put
to
one
side
or
put
to
sleep
assuming
your
conscience
over
the
statute
precludes
a
non-native
born
child
to
be
a
citizen
under
united
states
federal
law,
if
that
could
be
done,
then
i
should
think
you'd
have
a
stronger
case
as
in
any
and
the
fact
that
it
didn't
turn
out
that
way
is
precisely
the
situation
which
brings
the
estoppel
into
play
if
it
could
brought
into
play.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
--
that
goes
too
whether
or
not,
the
estoppel
is
made
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
things
clear.
that's
in
--
that's
--
that
is
that
there's
no
proof
of
the
estoppel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
two
very
different
things.
one,
if
you
say
one,
the
facts
making
out
an
estoppel
disproved
or
not
proved,
though
the
burden
is
on
her
to
prove
it.
if
you
say
the
record
doesn't
sustain
that
play
as
a
matter
of
fact
then
there
is
no
estoppel
because
there's
no
estoppel,
but
if
there
is
an
estoppel,
then
one
gets
to
the
question
whether
it
had
meaning
by
that,
estoppel
in
the
loose
sense,
about
as
loose
as
the
word
as
there
is
then,
lose
the
concept
if
there
is
in
the
law,
meaning
by
that
that
in
reliance
upon
representation
made
to
her,
she
to
her
disadvantage,
changed
her
position
with
terrible
consequence.
now,
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
no
consul
could
create
an
estoppel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
there
is
none
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
the
passport.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
--
if
the
consul
hadn't
told
her
that,
she
would
somehow
or
rather
gotten
to
this
country
before
the
child
was
born
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
thirdly,
she
did
--
she
was
not
disadvantaged
by
the
representation
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
relevant
to
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
would
you
please
answer
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
--
is
it
legally
relevant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
legally
relevant
then
it
ought
to
be
in
the
record.
if
it's
not
legally
relevant,
then
why
do
you
tell
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
gordon,
i
haven't
read
the
--
the
congressional
account.
in
the
--
in
what
was
said
on
the
floor
of
either
house,
was
acknowledgement
made
that
the
article
in
the
american
law
register
was
by
mr.
binney,
because
they
didn't
sign?
is
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
somebody
on
the
floor
of
either
house
mentioned
mr.
binney's
name
by
name.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
curiou
--
legal
curiosity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
doubt
about
it
on
basis
of
other
materials
but
i
just
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
anybody
in
congress
saw
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
binney
was
a
towering
figure
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
back
in
those
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
wasn't
it,
the
fact,
mr.
gordon,
that
by
the
laws
of
some
of
the
foreign
country,
the
mother
--
what
is
it
called
now,
the
cable
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
cable
--
our
cable
act
was
--
came
much
--
was
--
came
much
--
the
objective
of
that
and
the
legal
consequence
of
that,
that
a
woman
may
retain,
withhold
a
nationality
on
marrying
an
american
citizen.
that
was
the
law
in
--
in
some
of
the
european
countries
much
earlier,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
was
our
law,
but
it
raises
dubious
question
if
an
english
woman
married
an
american
and
under
--
under
english
laws,
even
if
she
retained
her
citizenship
as
an
english
woman,
she
might
not
avail
what
might
be
called
a
pure
american
citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
it
might
raise
questions
under
--
under
the
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
black's
question
was
if
you
don't
look
at
anything
except
the
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
is
this
from
the
report
on
the
cable
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
that
was
part
of
the
cumming's
nationality
proposal,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
nationality
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
part
of
the
comprehensive
nationality
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
are
you
saying
what
incongruity
there
is,
is
in
the
statute
of
congress
and
not
in
any
construction
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
chief
justice
taft
in
the
(inaudible)
weedin
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
weedin
case
spoke
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
the
statues
must
be
construed.
now,
the
act
was
bill
of
1997,
this
was
long
before
woman
suffrage,
long
before
the
whole
change
of
congressional
mind
and
judicial
mind
as
to
the
status
of
women.
and
therefore,
these
so
called
incongruities,
warranting
congress
at
all
if
you
put
them
in
the
context
of
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
dealing
with
the
1934
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
broader
down
from
the
1907
act
because
of
the
same
provision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
telling
me
--
just
to
my
--
i
ought
to
know
but
i
don't.
does
every
alien
--
does
everybody
who
come
here
--
in
here
get
a
certificate
on
arrival?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
on
the
ship's
manifest,
but
is
there
a
separate
document,
call
it
certificate
of
arrival?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
curious.
i
thought
i
mentioned
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
37.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
mr.
gordon,
is
that
given
to
the
entrance,
anybody
comes
here
and
gets
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
a
citizen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
get
his
documents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
never
did.
he
never
did,
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
arises
stronger
certificate
of
--
what
is
this
called?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
an
entry
on
the
books
of
so
called
--
of
the
immigration
the
citizen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
neither,
he
didn't
enclose
that
they're
here
you
take
this
on
whatever
wrong
with
your
automobile
lies.
