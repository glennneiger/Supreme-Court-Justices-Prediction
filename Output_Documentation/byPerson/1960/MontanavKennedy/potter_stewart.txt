stewart
you
would
read
both
as
i
understand
it,
as
though
the

“now”
were
not
there.
do
you
think
“now”
is
simply
surplusage?
justice

stewart
why,
is
that
it?
this
is
a
general
--
justice

stewart
what
if
it's

what
if
the
statute
simply
said,
“who
are
you
that
the
word
now
weren't
there?
justice

you
would
read

get
a
passport
before
you
left

naturalized

a

a
native
citizen
is
that
only
the

probably
can
become
