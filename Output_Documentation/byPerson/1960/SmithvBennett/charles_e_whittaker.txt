justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
true
we're
not
that
every
prisoner
up
at
fort
madison
has
$4.
the
state
pays
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hill
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
soundly
can
one
contend
that
states
must
provide
a
post-convictions
remedy
when,
under
the
laws,
as
i
understand
it,
they
do
not
have
to
allow
even
a
direct
appeal.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
truly,
because
the
federal
habeas
corpus
could
issue
the
statement.
but
isn't
it
true
that
the
state
doesn't
have
to
allow
even
an
appeal
so
far
as
the
federal
constitution
is
concerned?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh
surely
to
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
hultman.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
object
of
the
suit
is
what,
liberty,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
of
his
--
deprived
of
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
now
then,
does
your
argument
mean
that
the
substantive
right
to
require
into
the
legality
of
his
detention
depends
upon
nomenclature?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
what
you
call
the
proceeding?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
didn't
call
it
civil
or
criminal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what's
the
distinction?
i
thought
that
was
the
right
one.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
were
they
entitled
to
that
remedy
or
not
before
1689?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
didn't
reach
that
however
by
denying
their
affidavits
of
poverty
in
such
a
case.
it
would
be
an
issue
of
question
whether
they
have
$4.
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
do
it
here.
