justice

stewart
in
stating
your
question
in
the
second
alternative
way,
you
meant
--
you
mean
post
conviction
remedy
other
than
direct
appeal?
justice

stewart
and
either
stated
appeals
deal
or
an
unsuccessful
appeal.
justice

stewart
there
is
provision
for
in
forma
pauperis
direct
appeal
without
(inaudible)
justice

stewart
federal
system
it's
--
it
becomes
quite
important
from
at
least
one
point
of
view,
and
that
is
the
time
for
an
appeal,
the
time
in
which
an
appeal
made.
i
suppose
that's
true
in
many
states.
there's
different
time
allowed
there
in
criminal
cases
from
that
allowed
in
civil
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
number
of
others
but
that's
technical
way
in
which
you
be
dispositive,
through
which
the
issue
can
become
very
important.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
state
of
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
or
anywhere
else
that
would
prevent
a
state
if
it
wanted
to
from
denominating
a
habeas
corpus
writ
as
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
how
would
you
get
a
proper
and
fair
disposition
of
their
meritorious
claims
if
they
didn't
have
to
support
them?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
