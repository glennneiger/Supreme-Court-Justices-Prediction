justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
iowa
did
denominate
a
criminal
statute,
what
would
be
your
proceeding?
what
would
be
your
argument
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
it
be
--
can
it
be
made
in
a
more
criminal
matter
than
it
is,
exempted
by
the
state
labeling
it
as
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
clarity
was
more
limited
to
that
where
simply,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
the
state
should
simply
as
the
statute
is
saying
that
hereafter
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
designated
as
criminal
proceeding.
would
that
change
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
statute
of
1867
were
you
referring
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
under
them
prisoners
in
the
states
have
not
been
entitled
to
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
issue
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
issue,
as
i
understood,
was
not
before
us.
i
understood
that
there
is
no
challenge
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
does
the
record
show?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
--
why
wouldn't
it
have
a
bearing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
would
still
be
whether
a
pauper
that's
been
shown
and
not
denied,
whether
a
pauper
would
be
allowed
to
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
attorney
general,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that,
roughly
speaking,
all
the
nature
of
your
institutions
can
straight
to
get
a
$4
if
they
really
have
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
your
all
courts
flooded
with
petitions
of
habeas
corpus
with
these
$4,
with
these
available
$4?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
$4
came
along
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
$4
accompanied
the
position.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
think
now
if
that
they
don't
mean
that
if
the
state
to
get
$4,
there
would
be
an
avalanche.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
attorney
general's
office
answer
--
make
responsible
for
these
petitions
or
the
local
county?
