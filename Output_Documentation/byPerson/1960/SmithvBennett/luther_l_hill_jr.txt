mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
smith
and
marshall
are
presently
incarcerated
in
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
at
fort
madison,
iowa.
they
both
attempted
to
file
petitions
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
in
and
for
lee
county,
iowa.
neither
petition
for
a
writ
was
allowed
by
the
court
because
of
the
failure
to
pay
a
$4
filing
fee
required
by
section
606.15
of
the
code
of
iowa.
both
petitioners
attempted
to
appeal
to
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
the
iowa
supreme
court
denied
their
motions
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
apparently
because
of
the
failure
to
pay
the
filing
fee,
a
$3
fee
this
time,
required
by
section
685.3
of
the
iowa
code.
now
to
back
up
for
just
a
minute
to
get
the
picture
of
these
two
men,
smith
was
sentenced
to
10
years
in
prison
for
breaking
and
entering.
he
was
paroled
to
his
home
in
iowa
city,
iowa.
shortly
after
he
was
paroled,
he
was
picked
up
for
an
alleged
parole
violation.
he
was
returned
to
the
iowa
penitentiary
and
his
sentence
was
there,
he
claims,
arbitrarily
extended.
he
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
he
alleged
that
unconstitutional
methods
and
procedures
have
been
used
in
his
rearrest
and
he
accompanied
his
petition
with
an
affidavit
of
poverty
and
a
motion
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
he
thereafter
received
a
letter
from
the
clerk
of
the
lee
county,
iowa
district
court.
that
letter
read
in
full
as
follows.
“i
am
returning
your
motion
to
allow
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
forma
pauperis.
if
you
will
mail
this
office
$4
to
cover
the
filing
fee
for
the
above,
it
will
be
presented
to
the
honorable
w.l.
hughes'
count,
who
is
one
of
the
judges
in
that
district.”
smith
then
attempted
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
iowa.
he
moved
for
a
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
in
that
court.
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
denied
the
motion.
he
then
applied
for
certiorari
to
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
attempted
to
appeal
to
this
court.
the
appeal
was
dismissed
but
paupers
were
treated
as
a
petition
for
certiorari.
certiorari
was
granted
and
limited
to
the
question
presented
in
burns
versus
ohio.
marshall,
who
was
the
other
petitioner
here,
pled
guilty
to
the
crime
of
breaking
and
entering.
he
too
was
sentenced
to
10
years
in
the
fort
madison,
iowa
penitentiary.
he
attempted
to
file
a
habeas
corpus
petition,
alleging
that
his
plea
of
guilty
was
obtained
by
coercion
and
do
arrest
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
that
the
county
attorney's
information
was
fatal
on
its
face.
he
too
accompanied
his
petition
with
an
affidavit
of
poverty
and
a
motion
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
he
alleged
that
he
was
wholly
without
funds
to
pay
the
filing
fees
required.
in
marshall's
case,
the
court
in
the
lee
county
iowa
district
court
actually
rendered
two
opinions.
in
the
first
opinion,
the
court
said
that
the
filing
fee
had
not
been
paid
and
therefore
the
matter
was
not
properly
before
it.
but
even
were
the
filing
fee
paid,
still
the
petitioner
did
not
allege
grounds
on
which
habeas
corpus
in
which
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
could
be
allowed.
subsequently,
the
petitioner
made
a
motion
to
settle
the
record
on
appeal.
and
the
court
issued
another
opinion
in
which
he
said,
“there
is
no
record
to
settle
on
this
appeal.
the
appeal
can
only
be
from
the
order
denying
the
petitioner's
request
to
file
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
a
pauper.”
so
that
the
only
paper
is
necessary
to
be
presented
on
this
appeal
would
be
the
application
to
permit
the
petitioner
to
file
without
the
payment
of
the
statutory
filing
fee,
since
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
never
formally
considered
by
this
court.
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa,
once
again,
this
petitioner
attempted
to
proceed
in
forma.
his
motion
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
his
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court,
limited
again
to
the
question
decided
in
burns
versus
ohio.
thus
both
of
these
prisoners
remained
in
the
iowa
state
penitentiary
at
fort
madison.
their
contentions,
their
constitutional
question
raised
about
the
methods
and
procedures
incident
to
their
incarceration,
have
not
been
ruled
on
by
the
iowa
district
court.
the
issue
i
think
can
be
stated
as
follows.
can
the
state
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
close
the
doors
of
its
courts
to
those
petitioners
who,
because
of
their
poverty,
are
unable
to
pay
the
filing
fees
required
by
the
state
statutes?
in
this
case,
specifically
iowa,
the
$4
fee
in
the
district
court
and
the
$3
fee
in
the
supreme
court.
or
i
think
the
issue
can
be
phrased
somewhat
differently.
i
think
we
can
say
can
indigents
constitutionally
be
denied
in
post-conviction
remedies
in
the
iowa's
courts.
now
as
i
understand
the
state's
argument,
the
state
admits
that
filing
fees
are
unnecessary
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
iowa,
that
there
is
no
in
forma
pauperis
proceeding
in
iowa
in
habeas
corpus.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
that's
what
i
mean,
post-conviction
remedy
after
conviction
and
whatever
appeals
there
are
through
the
criminal
process
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
state,
as
i
say,
admits
that
there
is
no
in
forma
pauperis
proceeding
in
iowa
in
habeas
corpus.
in
defense
of
the
constitutionality
of
these
two
statutes,
the
state
argues
that
habeas
corpus
is
a
civil
proceeding
and
that
being
a
civil
proceeding
that
cannot
be,
the
rule
of
burns
versus
ohio,
cannot
be
extended
to
it
without
extending
the
rule
to
all
civil
proceedings.
the
state
also
seems
to
argue
that
in
this
proceeding,
it
is
a
defendant
and
that
it
would
be
grossly
unfair
to
require
the
defendant
to
pay
the
cost
of
plaintiff
in
a
civil
action.
state
also
points
out
that
if
the
plaintiff
is
victorious
in
his
search
for
habeas
corpus,
the
cost
will
be
taxed
against
the
defendant,
namely,
the
state.
the
state
also
argues
that
habeas
corpus,
as
used
by
these
petitioners,
is
purely
statutory,
not
constitutional
and
that
this
means
that
the
remedy
should
not
be
entitled
to
any
high
constitutional
protection.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
the
iowa
court
does
not
have
any
discretion.
the
statutes,
the
state
says
that
the
clerk
shall
collect
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
there
is,
i
believe
no
other
post-conviction
remedy,
your
honor.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
state
of
iowa
has
a
procedure
which
lives
up
to
the
full
letter
of
burns
versus
ohio
on
criminal
appeals.
there
are
provisions
for
the
furnishing
of
transcripts
of
records
and
there
are
no
filing
fees
requirements
in
those
cases.
though
we're
moving
a
step
beyond
that
now
to
the
post-conviction,
the
termination
of
criminal
post
appeal.
thank
you.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
accounting.
i
believe
they
go
into
a
separate
fund,
the
$4
fee
until
recently
it
was
$3,
the
district
court
fee.
the
state
added
an
additional
dollar
which
helps
to
pay
for
a
statistician
who
keeps
account
of
the
district
courts
to
make
sure
that
they're
keeping
address
for
their
work.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
i
would
imagine
not
your
honor,
i
do
not
--
i
don'
know.
maybe
the
attorney
general
can
answer
that
question
as
he
stands
here.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
it
helps
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
it
helps
to
maintain
for
the
--
legal
system
of
the
state.
the
final
argument
advanced
by
the
state
is
that
in
any
case,
the
federal
courts
will
be
open
to
these
petitioners;
they
have
in,
because
of
their
poverty,
exhausted
their
state
court
remedies.
i
think
before
we
move
into
a
detail
consideration
of
these
arguments
of
the
state,
we
should
first
see
where
this
court
seems
now
to
be.
you
limited
the
grant
here
to
the
question
presented
in
burns
versus
ohio.
clearly,
burns
versus
ohio
was
a
criminal
case.
it
was
a
case
of
a
criminal
appeal
in
ohio.
involved
there
was
whether
a
motion
for
a
leave
to
appeal
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
could
be
filed
by
a
pauper.
he
not
having
the
necessary
$20
filing
fee.
he,
the
pauper
in
that
case,
burns,
received
a
letter
from
the
clerk
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
stating
that
without
payment
of
the
filing
fee,
the
motion
for
leave
to
appeal
would
not
be
considered.
this
court
held
that
the
state
cannot
constitutionally
impose
financial
barriers
on
the
right
of
indigent
criminal
defendants
to
appeal.
in
that
case,
i
think
the
philosophy
of
this
court
was
clearly
stated
in
the
majority
opinion.
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
assuming
that
indigent's
motions
for
leave
to
appeal
will
be
less
meritorious
than
those
of
other
defendants.
indigents
must
therefore
have
the
same
opportunities
to
invoke
the
discretion
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
here
the
action
of
the
statute
--
of
the
state
has
completely
barred
the
petitioner
from
obtaining
any
review
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
i
point
out
that
the
attempt
to
collect
the
$4
and
the
$3
in
this
case
has
completely
barred
these
indigent
prisoners
from
any
iowa
post-conviction
procedures.
burns
versus
ohio
followed
in
time
and
in
philosophy
the
decision
of
this
court
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
griffin
versus
illinois
again
was
a
criminal
appeal.
in
that
question
at
issue
was
the
cause
of
a
transcript
of
a
record
on
appeal.
this
court
held
that
the
state
must
furnish
either
a
transcript
or
an
adequate
substitute.
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
in
griffin
versus
illinois,
the
challengers
on
appeal
to
the
--
by
the
indigent
prisoner
where
a
challenger
is
base
on
errors,
mere
errors
committed
by
the
trial
judge
at
the
trial.
they
were
not
challengers
based
on
constitutional
questions
as
we
have
here.
now
it
seems
clear
i
think
that
in
criminal
cases,
this
court,
when
the
issue
is
presented,
has
gone
very
far
in
saying
that
rich
and
poor
must
be
treated
alike,
that
filing
fees,
cost
of
transcripts
must
not
be
allowed
to
interpose
between
the
criminal
defendant
and
the
prosecution
of
his
appeal.
the
distinction
between
the
griffin
versus
illinois
and
burns
versus
ohio,
as
the
state
has
correctly
pointed
out,
is
that
habeas
corpus
has
long
been
held
to
be
by
most
courts
a
civil
proceeding.
this
court
in
the
matter
of
tom
tong,
in
108
u.s.
quoted
in
both
briefs
said
that
civil
--
that
habeas
corpus
was
a
civil
proceeding.
that
case
has
been
followed
by
other
court
cases
both
here
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
iowa.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
i
believe
that
was
a
criminal
case,
your
honor.
however
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that
right
away.
in
the
one
iowa
case
or
in
one
of
the
iowa
case,
they
issue
as
a
matter
of
bail.
and
in
the
second
iowa
case,
the
issue
was
a
matter
of
whether
it
was
possible
to
tax
the
cost
against
the
county,
the
county
being
the
alleged
plaintiff
for
a
minor
child.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
well
there
are
a
number
of
--
there
are
a
number
of
various
distinctions
of
course
that
would
flow
from
the
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
now
in
one
state
at
least,
in
kansas,
in
gleeson
versus
commissioner
which
is
cited
on
page
15
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
kansas
court
said
that
at
least
in
cases
like
this,
where
criminal
prisoners
were
involved
who
were
seeking
habeas
corpus;
habeas
corpus
was
criminal
or
essentially
criminal
in
nature.
if
that
route
were
followed
by
this
court,
of
course,
there
would
be
no
distinction,
i
suppose,
between
burns
versus
ohio
and
griffin
versus
illinois.
but
assuming
that
that
route
is
closed
by
virtue
of
the
decisions
like
tom
tong,
we
move
on,
i
think,
to
a
consideration
of
the
nature
of
habeas
corpus
itself.
habeas
corpus
may
very
well
be
a
civil
remedy,
but
i
submit
to
you,
it
is
no
mere
civil
remedy.
it
is
long
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
an
essential
element
in
the
whole
fabric
of
our
constitutional
system.
in
darr
versus
burford,
for
example,
the
court
said,
“the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
commands
a
general
recognition
as
the
essential
remedy
to
safeguard
a
citizen
against
imprisonment
by
a
state
or
nation
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.”
the
same
kind
of
language
appears
in
bowen
versus
johnston,
306
u.s.
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
the
precious
safeguard
of
personal
liberty.
and
there
is
no
higher
duty
than
to
maintain
it
unimpaired.
i
think
the
popular
view
of
habeas
corpus
is,
perhaps,
expressed
by
the
read
along
quotation
which
i
certainly
shant
read
from
hendrick
which
appears
on
page
16
of
the
brief.
the
whole
idea
being,
popular
idea
being
that
as
long
as
the
writ
runs,
nothing
like
hitlerian
arrest
can
exist
in
this
country.
the
importance
of
the
writ,
i
think
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
it
is
found
in
the
united
states
constitution
not
in
the
bill
of
rights,
been
in
article
1,
section
9
and
its
inclusion
there
was
pointed
to
by
hamilton
in
the
federalist
as
being
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
wasn't
a
need
for
a
bill
of
rights
because
this
protection
was
already
in
the
constitution.
it
is
found
in
article
1,
section
13
of
the
constitution
of
iowa,
and
it
is
found
in
the
constitutions
of
a
number
of
the
other
states
of
the
union,
and
i
suspect
but
for
the
poor
facilities
available
in
the
morning
perhaps
in
all
of
the
constitutions,
the
states
where
i
found
the
provision
are
listed
on
pages
18
and
19
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
with
all
of
these
background,
with
all
of
this
feeling
about
the
great
writ
and
the
freedom
writ,
it
seems
that
you
are
here
considering
the
extension
of
a
rule,
the
rule
of
burns
versus
ohio,
to
a
cause
of
action,
to
a
remedy
which
is
not
ordinary,
which
is
not
a
mere
civil
remedy.
and
which
gives
you
a
very
good
ground
to
distinguish
between
habeas
corpus
and
all
of
the
other
civil
actions
trespass,
(inaudible)
and
so
forth.
now
this
has
been
done
by
one
state
court.
in
barber
versus
gladden,
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
oregon,
barber
sought
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
against
the
warden
or
the
prisoner
in
which
he
was
imprisoned.
he
moved
for
an
order
authorizing
the
judge
to
direct
the
county
treasurer
to
post
in
undertaking
on
appeal
and
to
pay
all
fees
and
cost
on
appeal,
or
in
the
alternative,
to
order
the
requirement
waived.
an
affidavit
of
poverty
accompanied
this
motion.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
held,
it
said
by
necessary
implication
of
griffin
versus
illinois,
that
the
statutes
requiring
an
appeal
barring
were
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
said,
it
maybe
--
that
a
distinction
will
be
suggested
between
the
two
cases,
namely,
griffin
versus
illinois
and
this
case,
because
griffin
versus
illinois
was
a
criminal
appeal
whereas
barber's
appeals
is
a
civil
action
for
habeas
corpus.
but
the
argument
cuts
the
wrong
way.
to
be
sure,
habeas
corpus
is
in
form
a
several
proceeding.
but
it
is
one
based
upon
the
provisions
of
the
oregon
constitution.
its
function
as
applied
to
persons
imprisoned
for
crime
is
to
afford
relief
from
confinement
under
a
void
judgment,
a
wrong
which
transcends
in
seriousness
mere
errors
of
law
at
trial.
parking
back
again,
of
course,
to
what
was
at
issue
in
griffin
versus
illinois.
now
unfortunately,
as
far
as
i've
been
able
to
find,
oregon
is
the
only
state
that
has
done
this,
but
there
have
been
two
cases,
the
case
in
the
district
court
and
the
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
of
appeals
coming
out
of
oregon
and
therefore,
governed
by
the
oregon
law,
the
same
prisoners
involved,
and
both
cases,
namely,
daugharty
v.
gladden
in
page
21
of
the
brief
in
the
federal
district
court.
there
the
federal
district
court
stated
the
question
whether
it
was
necessary
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
to
pay
fees
to
the
counting
clerk
to
obtain
the
transcript
of
record,
whether
that
requirement
of
the
oregon
law
was
constitutional.
the
district
court
stated
that
such
a
requirement
was
unconstitutional,
citing
griffin
versus
illinois
and
barber
versus
gladden.
but
the
court
want
to
held
--
want
to
--
where
they
had
to
hold
that
the
state
court
remedies
have
not
been
exhausted
that
this
prisoner
could
turn
to
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
that
case
was
then
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
first
reversed
the
district
court
and
held
that
the
state
court
remedies
had
been
exhausted
pointing
out
that
there
has
been
six
proceedings
in
the
federal
district
court,
five
proceedings
in
the
state
courts,
and
one
proceeding
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
that
all
of
these
together
amount
into
a
real
exhaustion
of
the
state
court
remedies.
then
the
ninth
circuit
went
ahead
to
say
that
the
dismissal
of
the
state
court
appeal
because
a
plaintiff's
inability
to
furnish
an
appellate
transcript
deprived
him
of
equal
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
quoting
directly,
“we
hold
only
that
those
state
processes
ought
to
be
made
available
to
rich
and
poor
alike.”
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
federal
district
court
to
allow
oregon
a
reasonable
time
in
which
to
take
action
and
conformity
with
the
opinion
barring
which
the
prisoner
was
to
be
release.
therefore
i
think
there
are
presently
two
cases,
one
in
the
oregon
supreme
court,
one
in
the
ninth
circuit
following
apparently
the
oregon
law,
both
of
which
hold
that
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
the
state
may
not,
under
griffin
versus
illinois,
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause
thereof,
may
not
constitutionally
interpose
financial
barriers
between
a
prisoner
and
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
now
the
state,
of
course,
argues
that
if
you
extend
the
rule
of
burns
versus
ohio
to
habeas
corpus,
you
will
extend
it
to
all
civil
actions.
i
would
submit
respective
to
you
that
that
does
not
necessarily
follow.
as
we
have
seen
habeas
corpus
is
not
a
mere
civil
remedy.
i
think
you
have
a
line
of
distinction
there.
it
is
obvious
that
the
extension
was
so
limited
in
barber
versus
gladden.
this
distinction
that
i
am
suggesting,
the
distinction
which
is
built
on
the
personal
liberty,
on
the
very
nature
of
this
writ
and
the
importance
of
the
writ,
as
suggested
by
former
chief
justice
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
in
an
article
on
page
--
that's
quoted
on
page
25
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
it
was
suggested
by
judge
hamley
of
the
ninth
circuit,
a
distinction
which
makes
of
habeas
corpus
an
action
so
important
at
least
when
used
in
this
context
that
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
interpose
these
financial
barriers
between
the
writ
and
the
prisoner.
now
i
think
this
whole
problem
can
be
approached
from
a
slightly
different
point
of
view.
it
is
a
point
of
view
that
i
alluded
to
earlier
and
that
in
response
to
a
question
that
was
put
to
me,
to
some
extent
came
out.
namely,
i
believe
it
is
the
law
as
stated
by
this
court
that
the
states
must
of
necessity
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
provide
some
kind
of
a
post-conviction
remedy
for
imprisoned
prisoners.
now
certainly,
this
is
the
feeling
of
the
law
enforcement
official
to
the
country.
i've
quoted
on
page
27
of
the
brief
a
statement
of
a
special
committee
on
habeas
corpus
report
to
the
conference
of
chief
justices
residing
from
a
california
report.
there
they
said
that
any
proposition
can
be
stated
dogmatically
in
this
field.
it
is
this.
state
courts
must
provide
post-conviction
corrective
processes
which
is
at
least
as
broad
as
the
requirements
which
will
be
enforced
by
the
federal
courts
in
habeas
corpus
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
a
state
can
call
this
remedy
whatever
it
wants
but
it
must
provide
some
corrective
process,
see
mooney
versus
holohan.
now
candor
compels
me
to
admit
to
you
that
mooney
versus
holohan,
to
my
opinion,
does
not
go
quite
that
far,
although
it
goes
quite
far
i
believe.
however
in
young
versus
ragen,
an
illinois
prisoner
attempted
to
obtain
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
this
writ
was
denied
by
the
illinois
court
without
a
hearing
because
it
was
insufficient
in
law
and
substance.
this
court
speaking
through
chief
justice
vinson
said,
“of
course
we
do
not
review
decisions
which
rest
upon
adequate
nonfederal
grounds,
and,
of
course,
illinois
may
choose
the
procedure
it
deems
appropriate
for
the
vindication
of
federal
rights.
but
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
state
procedure
when
a
state
court
of
last
resort
closes
the
door
to
any
consideration
of
the
claim
of
denial
of
federal
rights.
and
what
is
the
effect
of
the
denials
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
number
--
and
that
is
the
effect
of
the
denials
of
habeas
corpus
in
a
number
of
cases
now
before
this
court.”
“unless
habeas
corpus
is
available,
therefore,
we
are
led
to
believe
that
illinois
offers
no
post-trial
remedy
in
cases
of
this
kind.
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
to
which
this
court
has
required
scrupulous
adherence
of
all
federal
courts
presupposes
that
some
adequate
state
remedy
exists.
we
recognize
the
difficulties
with
which
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
faced
in
adapting
available
state
procedures
to
the
requirement
that
prisoners
be
given
some
clearly
defined
method
by
which
they
may
raise
claims
of
denial
of
federal
rights.
nevertheless,
that
requirement
must
be
met.
if
there
is
now
no
post-trial
procedure
by
which
federal
rights
may
be
vindicated
in
illinois,
we
wish
to
be
advised
of
that
fact
upon
remand
of
this
case.”
if
the
states
must
furnish
a
post-conviction
remedy
for
prisoners,
then
i
think
it
clearly
follows
that
that
post-conviction
remedy,
if
the
teaching
of
burns
versus
ohio
and
griffin
versus
illinois
means
anything,
that
post-conviction
remedy
cannot
be
limited
only
to
the
rich.
it
must
be
available
to
the
poor
and
the
rich.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
philosophy
of
the
two
cases.
now
let
me
say
that
in
iowa
there
is
a
post-conviction
remedy.
it
is
habeas
corpus.
it
is
available
to
any
prisoner
of
the
fort
madison
penitentiary
who
has
$4.
it
is
not
available
to
these
two
prisoners
because
they
do
not
happen
to
have
$4.
the
state
argues
that
this
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
the
petitioners
have
now
exhausted
their
state
remedies
and
can
go
to
the
federal
courts.
it
is
true
of
course
that
in
the
federal
courts
there
is
an
in
forma
pauperis
proceeding.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
work
is
made
available
by
the
state.
the
affidavits
of
poverty
filed
in
these
cases,
your
honor,
were
not
challenged
--
have
not
been
challenged
as
far
as
i
know
by
the
state.
whether
these
--
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
hearing,
we
must
accept
those
affidavits
as
true,
and
in
both
cases
they
allege
that
they
do
not
have
the
funds
with
which
to
pay
the
$4
fee.
this
is
something
--
in
the
lee
county
iowa
district
court,
this
is
something
that
the
court
had
considered
these
affidavits.
it's
certainly
could
have
made
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
in
fact
the
affidavits
were
true
but
this
has
not
been
done.
and
so
now
as
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
i
think
we
must
accept
the
statements
as
being
true,
namely,
they
don't
have
$4.
now
the
federal
courts
probably
will
be
open
to
these
petitioners.
i
might
point
out
however
that
iowa
is
in
the
eighth
circuit
and
that
it
is
the
eighth
circuit
opinion,
willis
versus
utecht
cited
on
page
8
of
the
state's
brief
that
seems
to
hold
that
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
is
not
shown
merely
because
of
the
poverty
and
consequent
inability
of
the
petitioners
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
obtain
habeas
corpus.
in
that
case
which
involved
a
minnesota
prisoner,
the
ninth
circuit
--
the
eighth
circuit
said,
“the
proper
procedure
under
minnesota
law”
and
this
after
the
affidavits
of
poverty
were
filed.
“the
proper
procedure
under
minnesota
law
was
to
file
an
application
for
such
a
writ
with
filing
fees
in
the
district
court.
and
that
the
decision
of
that
court
was
adverse
then
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
that
seems
to
be
the
whole
--
i
say
it
seems
to
be
because
in
that
case
they
allude
to
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
had
special
--
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
writ
under
special
circumstances
and
they
specifically
say
at
one
point
in
the
decision
that
the
special
circumstances
have
not
been
shown,
but
then
they
go
ahead
with
this
other
language
to
the
effect
of
the
remedy.
now
whether
they
are
saying
that
they
don't
believe
the
affidavit
of
poverty
which
is
possible
and
that
if
the
affidavit
of
poverty
had
been
true,
the
minnesota
court
would
have
allowed
the
writ
under
the
special
circumstances
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
but
at
any
rate,
i
think
the
thing
to
observe
here
is
that
in
eighth
circuit
it's
not
altogether
clear
that
these
two
petitioners
can
go
to
the
federal
district
court.
it's
not
altogether
clear.
now
not
only
is
that
an
area
of
perhaps
some
little
doubt,
but
i
think
that
it
has
been
one
of
the
hallmarks
of
our
system
that
one
set
of
court
should
have
do
regard
for
another
set
of
courts.
as
i
understand
the
opinions
of
this
court,
it
has
been
the
view
of
this
court
that
it
would
be
unseeingly
for
a
federal
district
judge
to
pass
on
the
decision
of
a
supreme
court
of
state
without
giving
--
or
the
courts
of
a
state
without
giving
the
supreme
court
or
the
upper
courts
of
that
state
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
alleged
errors.
that's
what
we
have
here.
the
allegation
is
in
the
petitions
for
a
writ
are
based
on
the
actions
of
iowa
law
enforcement
officers,
iowa
police
officers.
and
it
seems
altogether
fitting
on
pauper
that
those
allegations
of
unconstitutional
acts
should
first
be
passed
on
by
the
iowa
courts
before
the
matter
is
referred
to
the
federal
courts.
now
i
think
the
state's
argument
avoids
another
issue
which
seems
to
me
to
be
at
the
heart
of
these
cases,
namely,
the
distinction
between
those
who
have
$4
and
those
without.
i've
alluded
to
this
already.
as
i
said,
iowa
courts
are
open
to
everyone
with
$4,
apparently,
$4
plus
$3
when
you
go
to
the
supreme
court.
they
apparently
are
close
to
those
who
do
not
have
the
$4.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
in
iowa
there
is
a
post-conviction
remedy,
a
post-conviction
remedy
for
prisoners
with
the
means
to
obtain
that
remedy.
that
set
of
prisoners
can
go
through
the
iowa
courts.
the
other
set
of
prisoners,
namely
those
without
the
$4,
are
to
be
sent
to
the
federal
courts.
it
seems
again
that
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
an
invidious
discrimination
or
characterization
which
this
court
struck
down
in
burns
versus
ohio
and
griffin
versus
illinois.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
i
have
not
made
an
exhaustive
survey.
i
know
that
in
oregon
because
of
the
barber
case
filing
fees
are
not
required.
i
know
that
in
new
jersey,
there
is
an
in
forma
pauperis
proceeding,
statutory
proceeding
apparently
for
habeas
corpus.
how
many
other
states
--
i
would
suspect
it's
a
minority,
how
many
other
states
though
have
adopted
the
federal
system
--
federal
plan
of
having
an
in
forma
proceeding
i
do
not
know.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
i
--
i
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
i
would
think
so.
i
--
i
am
sure
that
it's
not
been
done.
i'm
sure
that
it
can
be
of
any
kind
that
is
not
been
done
judicially,
by
judicial
decision
in
any
state
other
than
oregon.
and
i
am
--
i
am
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
but
i
would
assume
again
that
where
there
is
already
a
criminal
in
forma
pauperis
method
or
procedure,
these
same
funds
could
be
made
available.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
i
--
i
do
not
know
what
the
present
situation
your
honor,
i
don't
know,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
in
conclusion
then,
i
think
we
can
say
that
these
two
men
are
still
in
prison
in
fort
madison.
no
iowa
court
has
as
yet
passed
on
the
merits
of
their
claim.
we
submit
that
philosophy
of
burns
versus
ohio
and
the
griffin
case
guarantees
to
these
indigent
prisoners
a
day
in
court.
certainly
we
cannot
assume
that
their
constitutional
claims
are
not
meritorious.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
can
hold
one
of
three
things,
three
routes
to
get
it
to
this
desired
end.
this
court
could
hold
that
habeas
corpus
is
essentially
criminal
in
nature
following
the
kansas
distinction,
and
therefore
there
is
no
distinction
between
burns
versus
ohio.
i
rather
suspect
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
every
habeas
corpus
where
criminal
prisoners
are
involved.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
not
habeas
corpus
where
a
wife
is
attempting
to
gain
custody
of
children
taken
by
the
husband
or
something
like
that.
this
is
the
distinction
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
and
as
i
think
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
there
are
other
consequences
that
flow,
the
time
governance
and
so
forth.
so
i
say
i
think
probably,
this
approach
by
this
court
is
foreclosed.
although
saying
it
is
essentially
criminal
in
nature,
does
not
necessarily
strip
it
all
of
these
other
civil
characterization.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir,
which
has
been
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
which
is
what
the
kansas
court
did
at
least.
but
a
second
approach
would
be
to
say
that
habeas
corpus
is
such
an
important
proceeding
involving,
as
it
does,
the
liberty
of
the
individual
that
it
should
be
made
freely
available
at
least
to
those
criminal
prisoners
who
are
seeking
it
without
the
interposition
of
a
filing
fee
requirement.
a
third
approach
would
be
the
whole
that
the
--
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
primitive
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
i
think
your
honor
again,
you
could
say
that
it
is
the
liberty
of
the
individual
to
make
the
distinction.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
it
is
just
as
important.
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
think
that
there
is
available
here
a
distinction.
it
maybe
a
distinction
without
a
real
deference.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
but
it
isn't
--
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
it
isn't
--
we
don't
have
a
mother
here
seeking
the
child
of
course.
the
third
case
which
would
avoid
this
latter
--
the
third
way
of
approaching
this
problem
which
would
avoid
the
latter
difficulty
which
you've
raised,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
would
be
to
hold
that
the
states,
as
i
think
perhaps
you
have
done
in
young
versus
ragen,
that
the
states
must
furnish
a
post-conviction
remedy.
that
being
true,
i
think
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
post-conviction
remedy
must
be
open
to
rich
and
poor
alike.
this
distinction
or
this
approach
to
the
problem
avoids
the
problem
with
the
mother
and
avoids
the
problem
of
characterizing
habeas
corpus
as
a
civil
or
a
criminal
proceeding,
because
it
need
be
neither
for
this
purpose,
it
is
simply,
in
this
case
in
iowa,
the
post-conviction
remedy,
and
as
such
it
should
be
available
to
all
alike.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
well
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
--
i
will
admit
that
the
wording
in
young
versus
reagan
is
not
quite
as
clear
as
i'd
like
to
have
it
be
and
yet
that
seems
to
be
the
necessary
implication
of
that
decision,
namely,
that
there
must
be
some
post-conviction
remedy
and
the
court
said,
“if
the
illinois
does
not
have
such
a
remedy,
we
want
to
be
informed.”
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
i
believe
true.
yes.
this
was
said
in
griffin
versus
illinois,
but
once
having
allowed
the
appeal
it
must
be
freely
available.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
but
it
just
seems
to
follow
from
the
young
case
that
there
must
be
a
post-conviction
remedy.
and
certainly
this
has
been
the
approach
of
the
law
enforcement
official.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
this
would
be
--
this
would
be
following
from
the
argument
in
griffin
versus
illinois
once
having
supplied
in
one,
it
must
be
available
to
all.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
well
in
that
case,
then
you
would
have
to,
i
think,
again
get
at
the
essential
nature
of
habeas
corpus.
now
if
you
can
ignore
the
criminal
civil
characterization
which
we've
been
talking
about.
and
if
we
can
say
that
habeas
corpus
is
a
post-conviction
remedy
and
not
characterize
it
as
either
civil
or
criminal
appeal,
then
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
very
easily
that
you
cannot
offer
habeas
corpus
to
the
rich
and
deny
it
to
the
poor,
but
this
is
to
forget
the
ear
marks
that
have
been
put
on
habeas
corpus
i
think.
mr.
luther
l.
hill,
jr.
there's
nothing
further
--
