mr.
hill,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
farmers
that
come
to
the
court
go
into
the
--
whatever
you
call
them,
the
registry,
adversity,
or
clerk
of
the
court,
the
funds
that
come
in
as
a
result
of
the
fee,
is
the
--
is
the
avowed
theory
that
they
possibly
go
to
sustaining
the
cost
of
the
judicial
system?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
go
to
a
separate
court
fund
or
do
they
go
into
the
general
service?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
happen
to
know
whether
all
the
fees
that
go
into
carrying
on
litigation,
does
that
sustain
the
cost
of
the
administration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
idea
is
that
it
should
in
part
contribute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
the
cost
to
maintain
the
judicial
administration
of
the
court,
the
legal
system.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
did
it
become
relevant
to
pass
any
--
express
any
view
as
to
whether
it
was
--
what
the
character
of
it,
it
was
civil
or
quasi
civil
or
criminal
or
quasi
criminal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hill,
have
you
had
opportunity
to
find
out
what
the
state
of
the
law
in
the
various
states
is
regarding
the
duty
believed
to
furnish,
to
bring
the
habeas
corpus
proceedings
without
a
filing
fee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
explicitly
or
with
reference
to
habeas
corpus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
less
likely,
i
think
probably
where
it
is,
there
probably
is
a
generalized
provision,
would
you
think
so?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it's
a
certain,
it
must
be
a
certain
fiscal
difficulties
for
courts
to
do
it.
i
mean
there
must
be
appropriation
for
this,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
on
how
legislation's
view.
you
happen
to
know
what
the
situation
is
in
illinois,
with
reference
of
griffin,
i
believe,
they
appropriated
$250,000
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
every
--
every
habeas
corpus
or
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
criminal
prisoners
are
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
instances
as
justice
stewart
has
indicated,
there
are
procedural
reasons
for
the
distinction
tom
tong
or
such
a
case
where
the
court
had
to
decide
whether
it
was
a
final
judgment,
whether
there
was
a
final
judgment
or
whether
a
certification
was
allowed
by
a
divided
court
alone,
if
it
was
--
if
the
case
couldn't
come
here
on
certification
which
said
merely
in
criminal
proceeding,
that
was
there,
the
purposes
of
having
direct
review.
so
that
the
determination
of
whether
it
was
civil
or
criminal
and
that
in
tom
tong,
it's
quite
unrelated
to
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
i
you
illustrate
this,
we
just
now
have
to
make
subdivisions
for
habeas
corpus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
would
have
to
say
habeas
corpus
in
relation
to
or
following
upon
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
stop
you
a
minute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
second,
that
might
apply
to
an
impecunious
mother
trying
to
get
hold
of
her
child,
gained
by
the
father.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
going
to
draw
a
line
of
importance,
that's
just
as
importance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
that
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
category
of
--
of
