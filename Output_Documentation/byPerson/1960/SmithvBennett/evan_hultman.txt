mr.
evan
hultman
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
members
of
the
court.
i
would
have
to,
at
the
outset,
conclude
earlier
by
this
battery
of
attorneys
to
as
present
together
with
the
court
reporters
that
both
the
petitioner
here
and
the
respondent
are
indeed
paupers
at
least
in
comparison
with
the
number
of
attorneys
and
counsel
that
are
involved
as
far
as
the
prisoner
is
concerned
here
today
and
the
state
of
iowa.
but
i'm
sure
the
court
will
agree
that
the
brevity
of
the
briefs
in
this
particular
instance
and
that
the
lack
of
counsel
as
far
as
numbers,
in
no
way,
are
a
reflection
on
the
importance
of
the
issue
which
is
before
this
court
and
as
being
presented
here
today
in
the
form
as
far
as
the
two
briefs
are
concerned,
and
most
briefly
in
the
case
of
respondent
to
wit
ten
pages
and
three
lines.
the
state,
at
the
outset,
admits
the
first
proposition
of
the
brief
of
the
appellant
here
that
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
cannot
be
filed
in
iowa,
nor
can
an
appeal
be
taken
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
until
filing
fees
are
first
paid.
i
would
hope
here
that
the
chief
justice
would
be
as
kind
to
the
state
of
iowa
as
to
the
state
of
illinois
when
he
stated
in
the
case
at
bar
which
is
the
primary
case,
the
ohio
case
that
we're
referring
to
when
he
stated
that
the
state's
commendable
frankness
in
this
case
has
simplified
the
issue.
let
it
be
known
at
the
state
of
iowa
secondarily
at
this
point,
admits
all
of
the
items
of
record
that
have
been
alluded
to
by
counsel
with
reference
to
the
procedures,
which
took
place
up
to
the
time
this
case
has
been
presented
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states.
but
gentlemen,
the
state
here
prays
that
although
the
state
of
iowa
will
be
left
upon
in
the
same
way
that
they'd
be
blessed
with
the
different
and
a
contrary
decision.
that
in
the
case
of
the
burns
case
which
is
the
primary
one
to
which
it
has
been
eluded
here
and
which
the
court
has
brought
to
the
attention
in
granting
this
writ
of
certiorari.
because
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
we
have
two
different
cases
all
together
involved
presently
from
the
burns
case,
and
the
griffin
case,
or
in
the
case
of
burns
and
griffin,
these
two
cases
were
concerned
with
one
direct
attack,
if
you
please,
direct
attacks
upon
two
criminal
convictions,
through
the
processes
of
three
criminal
appeals.
none
of
which
are
we
concerned
with
here
today
as
far
as
the
issues
which
are
acquired
in
the
case
before
this
court
today.
i
would
like
to
allude
first
of
all
to
a
premise
with
reference
to
the
case
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
was
referred
to
a
little
earlier
here
by
one
of
the
justices
and
was
referred
to
shortly
in
griffin
case.
where
it
has
been
stated
by
men
of
this
court
in
by
other
members
of
this
court
in
previous
years,
that
a
state
does
not
have
a
duty
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
--
of
the
united
states
nor
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
iowa,
in
this
particular
instance,
to
provide
even
a
method
of
appeal,
let
alone
a
post
criminal
conviction
remedy.
the
state
does
not
even
have
to
provide
this
as
stated
by
members
of
this
particular
court.
but
as
this
court
has
positive,
what
you
do
provide
and
here
again,
get
back
to
the
box
of
the
burns
and
the
griffin
cases.
if
you
do
provide
in
the
state
of
iowa
or
in
the
state
of
ohio
in
the
case
of
burns,
or
in
the
state
of
illinois
in
the
case
of
griffin,
then
you
must
provided
equally.
gentlemen
of
this
court
in
iowa,
paupers
are
allowed
to
appeal
from
criminal
convictions
without
the
prior
payment
of
filing
fees
by
a
statute,
by
a
statute
almost
100
years
ago
recognizing
the
basis
that
this
court
in
its
decision
in
burns
long
before
this
court
brought
this
case
to
the
attention
of
the
50
states
of
this
union.
secondarily,
likewise
by
a
statute,
state
of
iowa
provides
again
more
than
100
years
ago
that
filing
fees
and
transcripts
of
record
are
a
matter
to
be
provided
at
state
cost
to
a
pauper.
but
again
differentiated
completely
in
accordance
with
the
burns
and
griffin
cases
in
cases
of
direct
attacks
upon
criminal
convictions
and
criminal
appeals.
now
i
submit
to
this
court
that
here
today
we
have
an
entirely
different
question
being
submitted
and
was
ever
submitted
in
burns
or
in
griffin,
because
here
are
concerned
with
the
nature
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
iowa
already
provides
for
statute
what
is
required
by
burns
and
griffin
by
this
particular
court.
so
we
must
lock
to
the
nature
of
the
writ
itself,
and
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
the
nature
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
from
its
very
beginning,
all
through
the
period
of
history
and
to
its
present
day
been
a
civil
action
to
gain
a
civil
remedy,
and
this
has
been
well
settled
by
this
court
and
by
other
courts
including
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
iowa.
nowhere
as
the
definite
distinction
between
habeas
corpus
and
criminal
prosecution,
then
we're
clearly
set
forth,
then
by
this
very
court
in,
ex
parte
tom
tong.
i
would
like
to
quote
because
this
is
a
very
short
decision
but
i
think
it's
very
clear.
and
i
would
disagree
with
the
good
justice
frankfurter
when
you
mentioned
earlier
a
question
that
we
have
a
different
issue
involved
here
today.
i
believe
we
have
the
same
issue
as
far
as
the
nature
of
the
writ
itself.
the
court
stated
on
this
occasion
that
proceedings
to
enforce
civil
rights
or
civil
proceedings
and
proceedings
for
the
punishment
of
crimes
are
criminal
proceedings.
in
the
present
case,
as
the
court
in
tom
tong
was
referring,
and
it
was
a
criminal
case,
a
criminal
case
where
a
poor
chinese
store
merchant
was
in
violation
of
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
san
francisco
and
a
criminal
charge
had
been
brought
against
him
and
he
sought
the
writ,
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
the
court
said
in
the
present
case,
the
petitioner
has
held
under
criminal
process.
the
prosecution
against
him
is
a
criminal
prosecution,
but
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
he
has
obtained
is
not
a
proceeding
in
that
prosecution.
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
new
suit,
a
new
suit.
mr.
evan
hultman
this
was
a
state
writ
your
honor,
yes,
brought
by
him
to
enforce
a
civil
right
which
he
claims
against
those
are
holding
him
in
custody
under
criminal
process.
the
proceeding
is,
when
instituted
by
himself
for
his
personal
liberty,
not
by
the
government
to
punish
him
for
whatever
his
crime
maybe.
and
here,
gentlemen,
i
state
to
you,
is
the
clear
distinction.
mr.
evan
hultman
no.
it'd
be
very
fine,
but
this
will
be
in
accordance
with
the
history
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
has
been
delineated
and
determined
by
statute.
in
fact,
as
i
will
get
to
the
little
later
argument
here,
the
history
of
the
--
of
the
expansion
of
this
right
of
--
writ
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
statutory
in
nature.
it
has
not
been
constitutional
in
nature.
i
think
here
is
a
clear
--
mr.
evan
hultman
if
--
your
honor,
if
it
were
a
criminal
proceeding
and
a
criminal
statute
defined
by
the
code
of
iowa,
then
most
certainly,
i
would
agree
with
the
decision
of
the
court
which
i
do
agree
with
wholeheartedly.
the
two
cases
which
we
have
mentioned
earlier,
the
burns
case
and
the
griffin
case,
if
it
is
a
criminal
matter,
most
assuredly
then,
every
individual
should
receive
the
equal
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
evan
hultman
i
think
this
would
have
an
effect,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
should
have
greater
delineation
than
just
that,
because
the
writ
applies
to
many,
many,
many
instances
other
than
criminal
proceedings
as
the
court
has
mentioned
earlier,
for
example
of
other,
with
this
small
child
who
is
being
detained
under
circumstances
maybe
under
court
order
for
example,
and
the
writ
is
being
sought
to
obtain
the
freedom.
this
most
certainly
is
not
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
would
never
take
the
course
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
is
a
civil
proceeding,
the
same
as
the
history
of
this
particular
writ
as
shown
into
the
--
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
evan
hultman
it
most
certainly
would,
sir.
yes
most
certainly.
mr.
evan
hultman
the
opinion
itself,
your
honor,
but
it's
just
about
a
paragraph
in
length.
mr.
evan
hultman
no,
it
was
not
directed
to
a
question
of
in
forma
pauperis.
no.
that
is
correct.
it
wasn't
even
an
issue
in
tom
tong.
it
was
delineation
of
the
nature
of
the
remedy
itself
and
i
think
it's
very
clear
and
can
be
argued
at
this
point,
the
difference
in
the
remedies
here,
because,
for
example,
if
we
take
--
if
we
take
the
criminal
procedures
themselves
and
if
the
great
writ
is
what
it's
been
contended
here
today,
then
it
would
most
certainly
be
mandatory
upon
this
court
to
say
that
the
criminal
procedure
is
highly
memorial
as
to
bail
or
a
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
because
in
the
case
of
bail,
in
a
criminal
procedure
itself,
we
arrest
the
man
at
any
given
stage
of
the
proceedings
and
money
is
the
sole
determination
as
to
whether
as
a
man
remains
in
custody
or
whether
he
walks
free
with
his
personal
freedom,
even
before
there
has
been
a
determination
if
you
please,
as
to
whether
he
is
criminally
honorable
or
not.
and
so
if
you
follow
this
thinking,
this
reasoning,
then
most
certainly
we
must
throw
out
the
entire
thinking
of
statute
of
all
courts
on
the
issue
of
bail,
because
here
we
are
depriving
a
man
before
a
court
is
even
in
a
jury
rendered
a
decision
or
a
criminal
appeal
taken
by
direct
access
to
the
appellate
courts
before
there
has
been
a
determination,
if
you
please,
of
the
man's
innocence
or
guilt.
we
make
a
determination
based
on
money
as
to
whether
he
is
to
secure
his
freedom
or
we
deprive
him.
mr.
evan
hultman
this
is
true.
i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
but
in
comparison
to
$4
and
in
comparison
to
$3
as
we're
discussing
in
the
instant
case,
in
comparison
with
the
two
defendants,
if
you
please,
in
this
particular
action,
the
sum
of
bail
would
be
completely
prohibitive
in
nature
according
to
the
argument
here
regardless
of
how
much
it
might
be.
mr.
evan
hultman
yes.
mr.
evan
hultman
i
would
agree
your
honor
but
again,
this
is
a
matter
which
is
permissive,
on
which
the
court
would
agree.
mr.
evan
hultman
and
where
the
court
not
permissive
in
my
particular
instance
and
declares
the
fund
to
be
$100,
$500,
$5,000
or
$10,000,
if
we
follow
this
reasoning,
then
this
act
of
the
court
by
the
demanding
of
bail
most
certainly
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
same
as
the
requiring
of
a
$4
or
a
$3
fee.
even
more
so,
the
state
argues,
because
this
is
in
the
criminal
proceeding
itself
and
a
stage
even
prior
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
man
is
guilty
of
innocent.
whereas
in
the
present
instance,
we
are
requiring
to
something
as
i
stated
in
my
first
major
premise.
we
are
referring
not
to
a
criminal
proceeding
in
the
present
instance,
but
we
are
referring
to
something
on
beyond
criminal
proceedings,
the
major
premise
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
this
is
a
civil
remedy
on
beyond
the
criminal
proceeding
together
with
criminal
appeal.
in
the
using
of
these
writs,
we
believe
that
the
convict
in
this
particular
essence
is
the
plaintiff,
the
same
as
a
plaintiff
in
any
action
to
protect
any
of
the
personable
rights.
and
most
certainly
if
this
right
of
personal
freedom
is
what
it
is,
we
have
many
rights
which
are
of
equal
value,
the
right
to
protect,
the
freedom
of
speech,
the
right
to
protect
the
freedom
of
worship,
all
of
these
rights
most
certainly
are
as
basic
and
as
sound
as
the
protection
of
individual
liberty.
and
yet
all
of
us
would
agree,
i
am
sure,
that
these
are
civil
proceedings,
these
are
civil
rights,
and
that
necessitates
civil
remedies,
not
criminal
in
nature.
the
state
of
iowa
in
this
instance,
if
you
follow
this
particular
reasoning,
is
made
a
defense
in
a
civil
action
by
this
particular
defendant.
the
burden
is
and
should
be
in
any
civil
action
and
in
this
particular
instance
placed
upon
the
person
bringing
the
suit,
which
--
mr.
evan
hultman
yes.
mr.
evan
hultman
the
object
of
the
suit,
yes,
the
object
of
the
suit
is
that
a
wrong
has
been
done,
if
you
please.
he's
been
deprived
--
wrong.
mr.
evan
hultman
of
his
personal
liberty.
mr.
evan
hultman
no.
no
your
honor.
mr.
evan
hultman
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
hultman
no
your
honor.
mr.
evan
hultman
i
can't
--
this
is
the
very
point
i'm
trying
to
make
your
honor.
i
can't
draw
the
distinction
between
the
right
of
personal
liberty
and
its
value
than
i
can
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
the
right
of
freedom
of
religion
and
the
other
rights
which
we
hold
justice
here,
all
of
which,
if
all
has
been
considered
as
civil
rights.
and
this
is
why
i
cannot
draw
the
distinction
and
why
i
believe
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
a
matter
of
determining
a
civil
right.
mr.
evan
hultman
well
i
didn't
mean
just
in
answer
to
the
good
justice
question
a
while
ago,
just
a
matter
of
nomenclature
as
such.
it
would
mean
that
a
legislature
of
the
state
of
iowa
in
its
process
is
declaring
this
to
be
a
criminal
right,
a
criminal
writ,
not
just
detaching
a
name,
a
nomenclature
up
here.
that
was
the
basis
of
my
answer
to
the
question
here.
the
iowa
legislature,
your
honor
just
enacted,
in
just
putting
nomenclature
to
determine
the
basis
of
rights
in
order
to
courts
of
the
state
of
iowa
and
this
would
not
be
the
basis
of
my
answer
to
this
question.
it
would
only
be
because
the
right
itself
has
been
given
and
putting
a
criminal
form
as
a
criminal
right,
this
writ
as
a
part
of
criminal
procedure
by
statute
in
proper.
mr.
evan
hultman
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
the
question,
sir.
mr.
evan
hultman
i'm
not
sure
if
i
follow.
thus,
we
believe
that
that
this
writ
is
most
certainly
and
always
had
been
civil
in
nature.
here
i
would
like
to
allude
just
very
briefly
to
the
history
of
this
particular
writ.
in
the
case
of
the
original
habeas
corpus
act,
this
court
is
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
criminals,
convicted
criminals,
were
specifically
even
denied
this
right
in
its
original
form,
in
its
original
act
in
1679.
criminals
didn't
even
have
the
right
to
use
the
famous
writ,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
in
fact
as
justice
frankfurter
points
out
in
darr
versus
burford,
the
case
which
has
been
referred
to
earlier,
until
the
federal
act
of
1867,
only
federal
prisoners
even
enjoy
this
particular
right
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
state
prisoners
didn't
even
enjoy
this
particular
right.
and
so
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
iowa
that
this
right
has
basically
drawn
and
been
expanded
from
a
basis
of
statute
in
nature
and
not
constitutional
in
nature.
mr.
evan
hultman
this
is
the
federal
act
of
1867.
it's
cited
in
the
brief,
your
honor
and
has
been
referred
to
by
justice
frankfurter
in
the
burford,
darr
versus
burford,
case
which
is
also
cited.
mr.
evan
hultman
as
far
as
federal
law
was
concerned,
sir,
as
far
as
federal
law
was
concerned.
in
iowa,
most
certainly
before
this
time
further,
they
were
entitled
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
as
they
are
now.
in
the
event,
they
filed
a
filing
fee
of
$4
in
the
case
of
a
district
court
and
$3
in
the
case
of
a
supreme
court.
mr.
evan
hultman
no.
no
sir.
1867,
your
honor.
the
original
habeas
corpus
act,
i
would
say
is
most
certainly
in
iowa.
but
if
we
go
beyond,
if
we
go
beyond
to
the
point
where
we
assume
for
just
a
moment
which
i
don't
think
that
the
state
must
do,
if
we
assume
that
there
are
indigents
in
the
state
of
iowa
or
in
any
other
state
in
the
union
that
can't
afford,
even
though
in
the
state
of
iowa
as
our
brief
points
out,
even
prisoners
in
the
state
of
iowa
are
gainfully
employed
and
in
a
matter
of
a
very
few
days,
even
prisoners
have
sufficient
money
to
provide
the
basis
for
the
filing
for
a
filing
fee
because
they
--
mr.
evan
hultman
pardon.
mr.
evan
hultman
i
am
--
i
can't
actually
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
that
was
deposited
by
the
other
counsel.
i
was
not
the
attorney
general
prior
to
the
--
mr.
evan
hultman
i
am
not
just
sure
on
this
point,
your
honor
as
to
what
the
record
does
show.
i
think
it
does
have
bearing
even
though
it
has
been
admitted.
let
us
assume
for
argument
that
it
has
been
admitted
by
the
state.
mr.
evan
hultman
i
think
it
has
--
mr.
evan
hultman
i
think
it
has
a
bearing
for
this
reason.
that
this,
as
a
counsel
for
the
state
will
get
to
in
just
a
moment.
this
is
one
of
the
great
dangers
that
are
inherent
in
such
an
extension
of
the
act
itself.
mr.
evan
hultman
it's
in
your
brief.
it's
in
the
state's
brief.
it's
a
matter
of
state
law
and
i
--
pardon
sir.
mr.
evan
hultman
well
i
have
referred
to
the
statutes
of
the
state
of
iowa,
which
states
that
prisoners
are
gainfully
employed
your
honor.
well
this
is
not
an
argument
of
counsel.
the
statute
is
cited
in
the
brief.
this
is
a
fact
by
law
in
the
state
of
iowa
that
even
prisoners
are
gainfully
employed
in
the
state
of
iowa.
mr.
evan
hultman
not
in
every
instance.
they
are
eligible
your
honor.
but
if
--
mr.
evan
hultman
this
--
this
your
honor,
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
state.
no.
mr.
evan
hultman
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
believed
by
the
state
of
iowa
that
if
such
an
extension
were
to
be
made
that
there
are
practical
considerations
within
this
extension
as
requested
and
wished
here
that
would
then
lead
be
the
seed
of
the
destruction
of
the
true
value
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
itself.
why?
because
it
would
do
these
things.
it
would
place
an
unbearable
burden
on
the
courts
at
all
levels
because,
as
this
court
has
held,
this
writ
is
not
a
matter
of
res
judicata,
it
can
be
filed
today,
it
can
be
filed
tomorrow,
it
can
be
filed
the
next
day,
and
everyday
for
the
entire
period
that
this
prisoner
is
confined
in
a
prison
or
institution
of
any
kind.
not
only
can
he
file
it,
but
of
course
he
can
take
the
appeal
and
thus
by
making
extending
this
rule
of
doctrine,
making
it
completely
free,
we
would
be
placing
an
unbearable
burden
on
the
court.
we
would
be
depriving,
if
you
please,
few
who
have
meritorious
claims,
the
few
who
do
have
and
most
certainly
there
are
those
who
do
a
prompt
and
a
fair
disposition
of
their
particular
condition
whatever
it
maybe,
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
anything
else.
mr.
evan
hultman
if
they
did
not,
sir?
mr.
evan
hultman
i
am
referring
to
not
just
in
the
case
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
but
all
proceedings
of
every
kind,
all
criminal
even
a
poet
decisions
of
the
court
in
the
normal
course
of
a
criminal
action
because
of
the
tremendous
load
which
would
be
placed
upon
the
courts
of
a
given
state,
this
given
district
court
where
this
penal
institution
is
located,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
iowa,
if
you
please.
mr.
evan
hultman
most
certainly
sir.
most
certainly.
all
of
their
needs,
clothing,
foods,
shelter,
and
everything,
are
provided
as
a
matter
of
law
first
and
secondarily
these
men
are
allowed
to
bear
money,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
evan
hultman
we
have
had
a
great
number
of
them
your
honor.
in
fact
there
had
been
a
great
number
filed
just
on
the
basis
of
this
court
as
was
the
case
in
the
case
of
the
massachusetts
and
new
jersey
courts
when
they
likewise
had
--
mr.
evan
hultman
pardon,
sir.
mr.
evan
hultman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
evan
hultman
there
will
be
a
great
deal
more,
i
am
absolutely
positive
of
this
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think
the
record
of
other
courts
as
cited
in
the
brief
who
have
referred
to
this
very
thing
that
is
indicative
of
that
thing.
mr.
evan
hultman
that
is
true,
but
this
will
take
a
considerable
amount
of
time
and
effort
on
the
part
of
the
court.
well
certainly
and
i
would
not
argue
with
the
court
that
this
was
not
done
here,
because
as
i
posited
earlier,
and
i
must
be
bound
by
the
record
of
course,
i
was
not
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
iowa
at
this
time,
and
so
i
cannot
speak
as
the
attorney
general
as
to
the
action
that
was
taken
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
evan
hultman
they
--
in
the
case
of
the
first
filing
of
the
writ
in
our
lowest
court,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
county
attorney
of
the
given
county.
in
fact,
in
response
to
the
question
asked
earlier,
the
last
long
distance
call
i
had
before
i
left
the
state
of
iowa
was
from
the
county
attorney
from
this
very
county
positing
the
statement
which
i
just
previously
made
to
the
court.
mr.
evan
hultman
no.
i
cannot
your
honor.
this
i
cannot.
i
do
not
have
the
statistics
--
mr.
evan
hultman
well
there
--
in
that
instance,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
well
to
point
out
in
just
before
closing
and
i
shall
close
that
the
oregon
case
and
the
federal
case
which
has
been
posited
here
following
the
oregon
case
which
was
based
upon
the
decision
that
the
oregon
court
made,
it's
very
interesting
to
me
to
see
the
position
which
the
oregon
court
took
there
and
the
language
that
they
used.
they
used
the
language
that
the
basis
for
their
position
in
the
state
of
oregon
was
the
fact
that
they
felt
they
posited
that
this
court
would
thus
make
the
extension
to
the
area
of
the
case
that
we're
arguing
here
today
and
thus
the
oregon
court
is
bound
and
they
use
very
strong
language
that
this
was
the
determining
basis
for
them
making
their
decision.
in
conclusion,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
we
contend,
is
a
civil
and
not
a
criminal
procedure.
the
questions
of
our
liberty
have
long
been
decided
in
civil
actions
brought
to
them
to
enforce
them
and
in
iowa,
one
who
institutes
a
civil
action,
must
pay
a
reasonable
filing
fee.
it
should
not
those
who
make
use
of
our
courts
to
enforce
their
fundamentals
of
liberties
bear
at
least
a
nominal
share
of
the
burden.
it
is
submitted
that
an
extension
of
the
burden
of
proof
to
one
of
these
basic
liberties
would
require
an
extension
to
all
of
them.
why
should
the
line
be
brought
at
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
civil
liberty?
why
not
for
the
prosecution
of
rights
of
free
speech
and
of
all
of
these
other
most
precious
liberties,
which
are
just
as
important,
or
the
rights
of
child
custody
or
confinement
in
mental
cases?
the
burns
case
is
the
logical,
the
legal,
and
the
practical
line
of
demarcation,
the
line
between
criminal
and
civil
rights
and
criminal
and
civil
procedure.
therefore,
respondent
respectfully
urges
that
this
court
upholds
the
constitutionality
of
the
iowa
statutes
in
this
particular
essence.
