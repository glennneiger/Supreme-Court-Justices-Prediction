mr.
hill.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
other
post-conviction
remedy
does
iowa
have,
if
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
isn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
if
the
state
mr.
hill,
even
if
the
state
was
not
required
to
have
a
post-conviction
remedy,
though
it
did
supply
one
for
the
rich
from
a
theory
of
griffin,
it
would
still
has
to
supply
one
for
the
poor,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl

mr.
hultman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
you
to
what
issue
is
that
language
of
the
tom
tong
case
directed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
it
--
was
it
on
the
question
of
whether
--
whether
he
was
entitled
to
file
his
petition
in
forma
pauperis
or
was
it
directed
to
some
other
instance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hultman
is
that
precisely
the
fact,
doesn't
it,
the
judge
make
his
decision
on
whether
--
on
what
is
necessary
to
have
the
man
respond
to
the
criminal
proceeding.
he
can
place
him
on
his
own
reconnaissance;
he
can
give
him
a
bail
that
is
within
his
means.
he
has
many
different
things
that
he
can
do.
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
money
on
bail,
because
the
court,
all
the
court
is
interested
in
is
to
--
is
to
have
him
respond
to
the
criminal
process.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
it
wouldn't
--
suppose
the
judge
--
suppose
the
judge
said
to
him,
because
you
are
an
indigent
and
because
we
feel
you
will
respond,
we'll
release
you
on
your
own
reconnaissance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
you
did
have
some
--
if
you
did
have
some
money,
well
we
probably
require
you
to
use
some
bail.
now
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
out
of
the
ordinary;
judges
do
that
all
the
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
all
prisoners
get
the
money?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
that
this
man
has
gotten
the
pay?
how
do
we
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
we're
bound
by
the
record,
aren't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
wondering
in
the
preparation
of
your
argument
about
the
avalanche
it
would
flow
from
any
such
rule
if
we
made
any
comparison
between
the
number
of
petitions
for
habeas
corpus
in
your
state
and
those
in
oregon
where
they
--
where
they
do
permit
them
to
file
in
forma
pauperis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
am
sure
we
get
more
in
this
court
from
iowa.
now
we
do
from
oregon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hill,
would
you
like
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
nothing
further.
before
we
recess,
mr.
hill,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
should
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
having
accepted
this
assignment
as
a
public
service.
we're
always
comforted
when
lawyers
will
do
that.
and
we
feel
that
the
interest
of
justice
has
always
made
more
secure
by
reason
of
it.
so
we
appreciate
it.
thank
you
very
much.
and
mr.
attorney
general,
we
thank
you
for
the
very
diligent,
very
arduous
way
in
which
you
are
protecting
rights
of
your
own
statement.
we
adjourn
now.
