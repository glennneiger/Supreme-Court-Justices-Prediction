mr.
mann,
before
you
proceed,
as
a
matter
of
information
is
the
observance
of
sabbath
day
of
the
--
the
sabbath
confined
along
those
who
profess
the
jewish
faith
to
orthodox
jews'
don't
--
conservative
jews
also
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
perhaps
some
other
branches
of
judaism.
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
you
--
do
you
know
how
many
orthodox
jews
there
are
in
pennsylvania?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
seventh
day
adventist.
justice
potter
stewart
this
would
be
true
then
of
the
--
of
the
atheist
we've
been
talking
about
is
simply
one
of
them
for
economic
reasons
to
work
seven
days
a
week.
would
it
also
be
true
in
your
opinion
of
the
man
suppose
the
reason
of
such
person
there
maybe,
does
religion
taught
him
and
told
him
that
it
was
sinful
not
to
work
seven
days
a
week?
justice
potter
stewart
does
pennsylvania
have
like
massachusetts
has
a
one-day-in-seven
law?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
--
excuse
me
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
the
points
you're
making
that
this
favors
or
rather
that
--
that
this
--
this
harms
more
broadly
and
more
largely
people
who
are
not
of
--
not
sabbatarians
and
who
may
indeed
profess
any
religion.
that
could
all
be
met,
couldnâ€™t
it,
by
a
--
by
the
kind
of
an
exemption
that
there
is
in
the
laws
of,
what,
nine
or
eleven
of
the
middle
western
states,
exempting
from
the
provisions
of
the
law
such
as
this,
those
who
have
gone
--
who
are
bona
fide
sabbatarians
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
practice
some
other
day
of
the
week.
justice
potter
stewart
does
your
general
sunday
statute
be
open,
not
this
one,
have
any
exemption
in
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
