(inaudible)
and
numerically
unimportant
jews
in
the
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
recent
elections
prove
that
very
small
minority
may
have
very
big
results.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
in
some
states,
this
is
involving
the
smaller
minorities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
just
arithmetic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
are
read
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
justification
for
that
in
any
opinion
of
this
court.
i'm
not
saying
they're
in
justification
of
your
argument,
all
i'm
saying
is,
you're
making
an
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
are
[laughter]
because
(inaudible)
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
are
expressions
in
opinion
and
views
by
individual
members
--
then
to
--
to
assert
that
there's
no
decision
of
this
court
which
pose
that
the
first
amendment
as
such
is
read
into
the
fourteenth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
just
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
just
as
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
the
bothering
decision
of
the
court
in
which
five
members
explicitly
concurred
in
an
expression
as
the
decision
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
you
were
arguing
this
case?
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
in
virginia
was
jefferson's
set
famous
statute
on
freedom
of
religion,
of
religious
freedom,
there
will
be
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
according
to
the
governor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
greatly
mistaken
that
there
is
a
jewish
community
in
virginia
in
that
concern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
numbers,
i
mean
the
fact
that
there
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
didn't
think
that
numbers
mattered
on
this
case,
do
they?
these
are
the
basis
of
your
argument,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
confused
that
you're
not
politically
affected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
object
to
this
and
not
the
--
not
the
--
it
may
not
appear
generally.
i'm
talking
about
thomas
jefferson
who
was
preoccupied
with
this
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
not
preoccupied
with
the
problem
of
religious
freedom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
suggesting
that
jefferson
didn't
know
that
jewsâ€™
holy
day
was
saturday
and
not
sunday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
doubt
--
and
any
doubt
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
intrusions
into
religious
freedom
have
any
doubt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
very
specific,
very
different-
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
important
to
keep
in
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
is
the
design,
you
would
agree
that
it
would
be
bad.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
--
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
discrimination
or
the
interference
or
impact,
whatever
you
call
it,
must
affect
the
same
--
the
religious
group
as
an
entire
group
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
that
the
body
rather
than
--
than
come
within
that
religious
groups
who'll
be
called
a
religious
troopers
are
affected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
favor,
mr.
berger,
do
you
favor
in
any
--
in
any
natural
use
of
that
word.
do
you
favor
somebody
because
you
prevent
a
general
--
a
universal
law
from
falling
unfairly
upon
a
particular
group?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
favor
it
--
to
equalize
matters.
