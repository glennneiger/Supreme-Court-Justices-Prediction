mr.
theodore
r.
mann
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
five
orthodox
jews.
as
has
been
discussed
in
the
earlier
case,
orthodox
jews
close
their
business
establishments
from
friday
evening
until
sun
--
saturday
evening.
my
clients
are
in
businesses
which
do
not
specialize
in
kosher
products
so
to
speak
but
which
deal
with
the
general
public
at
large
or
--
and
they
are
in
competition
with
other
business
selling
similar
items
such
clothing
and
shoes.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
pennsylvania
statute
which
was
just
passed
in
the
fall
of
1959
and
which
appears
on
page
2
of
my
brief.
it
is
a
statute
which
is
not
aimed
at
an
occupation
as
much
as
it
is
aimed
at
specific
commodities.
it
outlaws
or
proscribes
the
sale
of
specific
commodities
at
retail.
my
clients
sell
those
commodities.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes,
sir.
i
represent
orthodox
jews.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
requirements
of
sabbath
observance
are
part
of
judaism
generally.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
conservative
judaism
certainly
is
in
pretty
much
the
same
category
as
orthodox
judaism.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
reform
judaism,
perhaps
it
might
be
said
to
a
lesser
extent.
that
is
a
theological
dispute
that
i'd
rather
not
enter
into.
i
have
included
a
certain
amount
of
information
on
this
subject
in
my
brief
in
case
the
court
thinks
it's
relevant.
it
is
our
position
that
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
in
pennsylvania,
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
i
have
tried
to
find
out.
in
the
united
states,
i
think
they
professed
to
have
about
a
million.
i
have
some
information
in
my
brief
on
that
too,
although
there
is
no
exact
computation
made.
as
a
matter
of
information,
i
think
most
of
the
jewish
groups
objected
to
inclusion
of
such
a
question
in
a
critical
sentence
i
just
mention
that
passing.
we
assert
that
there
has
been
a
violation
on
a
kind
of
this
statute
of
the
first
amendment
on
two
separate
grounds,
of
course,
a
violation
of
the
free
exercise
clause
and
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
so
far
as
the
free
exercise
clause
is
concerned
it
is
our
position
that
this
kind
of
a
statute
puts
to
these
kinds
of
appellants
a
very
clear
choice
and
this
choice
is
in
essence
admitted
by
all
parties
to
the
specific
proceedings,
the
choice
of
going
out
of
business
or
at
least
giving
up
a
very
substantial
amount
of
their
income
or
giving
up
their
faith
or
at
least,
very
substantially
compromising
their
faith.
this
court
has
said
in
schneider
versus
new
jersey
and
thornhill
versus
alabama
and
in
many
cases,
that
when
a
party
litigant
walks
into
court
complaining
of
an
alleged
abridgement
of
a
first
amendment
freedom,
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
a
--
to
be
--
stood
to
examine
the
effect
of
the
legislation.
and
we
submit
that
the
effect
of
this
legislation
is
to
leave
the
orthodox
jewish
retailer
and
the
seventh
day
adventist
and
baptist
retailers
without
one
hour
of
weekend
time
within
which
to
conduct
his
retail
trade.
the
effect
of
this
statute
is
to
put
to
these
people
the
choice
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago
and
they
are
the
only
group
in
society
which
now
must
face
that
choice.
we
say
therefore
that
the
first
amendment
is
very
much
involved
in
this
case,
the
free
exercise
clause
is,
that
by
virtue
of
this
statute,
the
economic
loss
which
these
people
will
admittedly
suffer
and
it
is
a
serious
one,
becomes
an
instrument
of
com
--
compulsion
to
give
up
or
compromise
their
religious
faith.
and
for
that
reason,
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
or
test
by
similar
names
is
applicable
to
this
kind
of
litigation
and
the
scope
of
this
court's
judicial
inquiry
must
be
correspondingly
much
wider.
we
go
further
and
say
that
there
are
other
reasons
and
this
comes
really
to
a
question
justice
frankfurter
asked
a
few
moments
ago
of
mr.
ehrmann,
we
go
further
and
say
there
are
other
reasons
why
the
scope
of
this
court's
independent
inquiry
must
be
broad
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
i
can't
refrain
from
mentioning
the
fact
that
somehow
if
pennsylvanians
were
more
evenly
split
on
this
religious
question
of
which
day
of
the
week
is
holy.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
half
of
pennsylvanians
were
sabbatarians
and
the
other
half,
sunday
observers
that
quite
obviously,
this
kind
of
legislation
would
not
be
here
before
this
court
today,
it
wouldn't
pass
and
--
and
this
would
be
so
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
because
it
would
much
more
dramatically
appear
than
it
even
does
now
as
an
obvious
civil
interference
into
a
controversy
which
is
basically
religious
and
probably,
more
importantly
because
--
for
political
reasons,
such
legislation
would
not
pass.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
it
is
the
numerical
insignificance
of
the
sabbatarian
groups,
orthodox
jews,
adventists
and
baptists
which
accounts
for
this
type
of
legislation
being
before
this
court
today.
legist
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
they
are
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
--
numerically
unimportant,
yes,
sir,
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
seventh
day
adventist
and
seventh
day
baptist
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
--
in
course
of
it
[laughs],
but
that
is
what
accounts
for
the
legislation
in
its
present
form
permitting
of
no
exceptions,
not
taking
into
consideration
in
the
slightest
degree
the
problems
which
this
kind
of
legislation
creates
for
these
kinds
of
people
and
i
submit
that
in
such
situations,
aside
from
the
first
amendment
question,
in
such
situations,
the
scope
of
this
court's
judicial
inquiry
must
be
correspondingly
greater.
this
is
after
all,
not
a
case
of
mistaken
for
foolish
legislation.
this
is
not
a
case
where
legislation
which
foolishly
affects
people
in
a
state
that
the
normal
political
democratic
process
is
being
open
and
unobstructed,
the
state
legislature
can
be
counted
upon
in
due
time
to
repeal.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe,
one
year
from
now
or
five
years
from
now
or
50
years
from
now,
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
pennsylvania
are
going
to
be
anymore
concerned
with
the
problem
that
this
kind
of
legislation
creates
for
this
kind
of
people
then
the
pennsylvania
legislature
was
in
1959
when
it
passed
this
law.
and
for
that
reason,
i
submit,
this
court
must
have
a
correspondingly
wider
scope
of
judicial
investigation.
i'm
not
saying
that
for
that
reason,
the
law
should
be
ipso
facto
only
constitutional.
i
am
merely
saying
that
the
judicial
scrutiny
must
be
great
in
this
kind
of
case
than
in
others.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
don't
know
that
the
recent
election
involved
small
minorities
as
small
as
the
minorities
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
that
will
never
be
established
to
the
satisfaction
of
anyone,
i'm
afraid.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
now,
i
--
i
would
come
to
that
question
right
now.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
black
asked
the
question
yesterday
whether
this
case
would
be
different
if
the
religious
motives
were
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
that's
our
case.
the
religious
motive
is
not
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
this
is
a
new
law
and
the
--
my
brief
will
indicate
and
several
of
them
do
that
the
old
law,
the
pennsylvania
blue
laws
go
back
for
300
years,
the
old
law
was
very
much
like
the
massachusetts
law.
it
was
admittedly
religious
in
nature,
religious
in
effect
and
by
judicial
construction
deemed
to
be
religious.
the
appellees
take
the
position,
however,
that
this
is
an
irrelevant
consideration
in
this
kind
of
a
case
because
they
say
there
has
been
a
clean
break
with
the
past.
that
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
now
passed
a
new
law
on
its
face,
it
does
not
purport
to
--
to
be
a
religious
law
and
they
say
there
are
valid
civil
needs
and
this
kind
of
law
meets
those
valid
civil
needs.
so
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
sir,
the
--
this
law
is
a
new
law.
the
only
law
that
was
similar
to
it
was
a
law
enacted
a
year
earlier
affecting
only
the
sale
of
automobiles.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
have
to
directly
face
that
question
and
i'm
going
to
say
right
now
that
even
if
we
admit
arguendo,
the
civil
motives
for
this
kind
of
legislation
it
established
--
establishment
is
still
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
think
mr.
cantwell
versus
connecticut
makes
that
assumption
if
iâ€™m
not
mistaken.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
--
i
think
i
--
well
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
(inaudible)
opinions
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
in
cases
where
there
are
nine
opinions
filed
by
this
court,
it
becomes
a
difficult
matter
to
determine
exactly
what
the
majority
feels
on
this
specific
issue.
however,
even
assuming
what
you
say
is
correct
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
am
doing
so
but
i
might
--
can
use
all
the
help
i
can
get.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
[attempt
to
laughter]
may
i
say,
that
the
proponents
of
this
kind
of
legislations
we
have
in
pennsylvania
admit
at
least
this
much,
that
sunday
was
selected
as
the
day
in
preference
to
any
other
day
because
of
the
fact
that
the
great
majority
of
pennsylvania
citizens
observe
sunday
anyhow,
mostly
for
religious
reasons
and
so,
there
is
nothing
wrong,
they
say,
with
accommodating
the
great
majority
of
pennsylvania
citizens.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
proponents
of
this
legislation
say
a
lot
of
things
and
i
want
to
get
to
this
point
right
now.
they
admit
that
there
is
preferential
aid
with
this
kind
of
legislation.
they
merely
say
that
it
wasn't
intended
if
it
--
that
it's
not
the
primary
purpose.
they
say
the
primary
purpose,
the
only
purpose
is
a
civil
purpose
and
if
this
kind
of
law
preferentially
not
just
the
common
--
not
just
by
an
accommodation
but
preferentially
aids
the
majority
christian
group.
well,
this
is
merely
an
incidental
accidental
byproduct,
so
to
speak,
of
otherwise
valid
civil
legislation
and
so
it's
all
right.
they
go
further
than
that.
they
admit
that
this
kind
of
legislation
specifically
hurts
the
sabbatarian
groups
and
very
seriously
so,
but
they
say
that
if
this
is
so,
this
too
is
not
the
intention
of
the
legislature.
it
is
merely
an
accidental
byproduct
of
this
valid
secular
legislation.
so
they
admit
really
both
the
preferential
aid
and
the
interference
but
they
plead
that
it's
by
accident
and
the
appellants,
i
submit,
cannot
afford
these
kinds
of
accidents,
sabbatarians
cannot.
i
think
the
maxim
--
the
old
legal
maxim
is
applicable
to
this
kind
of
case
that
legislators
must
be
deemed
to
have
intended
the
natural
and
foreseeable
consequences
of
their
act.
i
submit
that
constitutionality
cannot
turn
on
the
question
of
motive
and
intent
that
a
legislature
cannot
avoid
the
specific
proscriptions
of
the
first
amendment
by
simply
saying,
"but
we
didn't
mean
it."
if
legislatures
know
what
the
result
of
legislation
will
be
and
if
they
know
that
it's
going
to
preferentially
aid
one
group
and
in
addition
to
that,
interfered
substantially
with
another
group
then
they
shouldn't
pass
such
legislation.
and
if
they
--
if
there
are
compelling
reasons
for
passing
such
legislation
and
i
submit
there
are
not,
but
if
there
were
then
they
most
certainly
cannot
pass
such
legislation
without
doing
everything
they
can
to
minimize
the
effect
upon
those
groups
upon
whom
the
legislation
worked
in
a
special
handicap.
i
have
argued
in
my
brief
also
that
the
fact
that
this
is
preferential
aid
to
the
majority
christian
group
as
against
the
minority
christian
group
and
orthodox
judaism,
hurts
the
sabbatarian
groups,
not
only
the
individual
practitioner
of
the
religion
but
hurts
the
groups.
we're
living
in
a
society
where,
according
to
the
zorach
decision
of
this
court,
we
have
a
certain
free
competition
between
sects.
and
it
is
the
law
of
that
case
that
the
government
must
be
neutral
when
it
comes
to
this
competition
between
sects.
this
case
goes
far
beyond
the
zorach
case
which
did
permit
under
certain
very
limited
circumscribed
circumstances,
accommodation,
so
to
speak,
of
religion.
this
case
goes
very
far
beyond
that
because
there,
at
least
there
was
an
accommodation
for
all.
here,
we
have
an
accommodation
for
some
and
therefore,
we
have
preferential
aid.
and
once
this
court
transcends
the
limit
of
strict
separation
of
church
and
state,
which
i
don't
believe
it
should
do
or
should
have
done,
certain
problems
inevitably
arise
with
regard
to
this
doctrine
of
accommodation.
certain
problems
arise
because
with
preferential
aid,
you
have
a
tremendous
disadvantage
between
sects
who
are
supposed
to
in
a
free
society
be
competing
freely
with
one
another
for
new
members
and
for
maintaining
their
adherence.
i
would
like
to
speak
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
reasonable
alternatives.
this
court
has
said
that
mere
legislative
preference
for
one
rather
than
other
means
of
combating
substance
to
the
evil
is
not
enough
to
justify
legislation
which
interferes
with
the
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
in
discussing
other
alternatives
and
some
of
these
questions
have
already
come
up
in
the
preceding
case,
in
discussing
alternatives,
we
have
to
start
with
the
proposition
of
--
well,
what
--
what
is
the
legislative
end
in
mind?
now
if
the
legislative
hand
in
mind
is
a
weekly
respite
from
laborers,
for
all
pennsylvania
citizens
then
as
has
been
said,
a
one-day-in-seven
statute
does
that
exactly
and
it
does
it
efficiently.
the
only
objection
to
it
that
i
have
heard
is
that
it
is
allegedly
difficult
to
enforce.
and
i
submit,
even
if
that
was
so
which
it
is
not,
that
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
passing
other
legislation
to
inter
--
which
interferes
with
first
amendment
freedoms
just
as
in
the
schneider
case.
if
the
purpose
of
government
is
to
keep
the
streets
clean,
they
may
pass
an
anti
litter
ordinance,
but
may
they
pass
a
law
which
forbids
the
distribution
of
handbills,
first
amendment
freedoms
are
involved,
they
don't
have
that
choice.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
does
that
the
jewish
faith
can't
practice
all
day,
saturday
under
such
a
law
and
they
can't
practice
on
sunday
either
because
the
courthouse
--
would
likewise
close
on
sunday.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
and
the
christian
cannot
practice
on
saturday
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
and
the
adventist
towards
you
may.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
first
of
all,
you
have
a
situation
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
the
muslims
do
in
friday
sir.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
no
more,
sir
than
they
had
a
right
to
complain
that
because
the
courts
are
closed
on
sunday
that
they
can't
practice
law,
let
us
say
and
that
they
are
disadvantaged
because
they
likewise
close
on
--
on
friday.
our
society
is
such
that
the
school
systems
so
far
as
when
children
are
home
for
example.
we
don't
have
the
--
really
a
six-day
workweek
anymore.
we
have
no
right
by
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
it
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
philadelphia
blue
law
case
very
recently
that
this
enforcement
argument
can't
carry
much
weight.
after
all,
it
is
the
--
it
is
the
sunday
blue
law
legislation,
not
the
one
day
in
seventh
legislation
which
has
a
long
history,
almost
a
tradition
of
sporadic
enforcement.
besides
which
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
briefs,
i
believe
it
was
a
--
a
civil
liberties
union
brief
in
the
next
succeeding
case,
two
guys
from
harrison,
there
are
specific
ways
set
forth
in
the
statutes
of
those
states,
one
day
--
which
have
one
day
in
seven
laws
of
satisfactorily
enforcing
them.
so
that
it
is
my
position
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
law
to
go
beyond
one
day
in
seven.
however,
it
is
--
the
position
is
taken
that
a
weekly
respite
from
labor
is
not
the
only
legitimate
end
of
this
kind
of
legislation.
that
it's
important
for
some
reason
that
number
one,
a
man
who
has
a
day
off
from
work
should
have
a
tranquil
community
in
which
to
enjoy.
it
is
important
it
is
said
that
husbands
and
wives
and
children
all
be
home
at
the
same
time
so
that
they
can
enjoy
their
day
of
rest
together
and
it
is
said
that
this
can't
be
accomplished
under
a
one
day
in
seven
law.
i
doubt
that
very
much,
but
basically,
and
the
question
as
i
see
it
as
related
to
this
case,
is
let's
assume
the
legitimacy
of
those
ends.
to
what
degree
is
it
necessary
to
enforce
the
law
against
the
sabbatarian
retailer
in
order
to
accomplish
those
ends?
after
all,
there
are
more
than
a
dozen
statues
in
the
united
states
which
--
like
--
like
the
pennsylvania
statute
which
contain
specific
exemptions.
and
no
one
in
any
of
these
cases
before
your
honors
this
morning
has
pointed
to
one
such
state
and
said
that
it
--
those
exemptions
have
not
worked
out
there.
that
on
account
of
the
sunday
operations
pursuant
to
such
exemptions,
family
life
has
been
in
tranquil
or
that
a
man
can't
enjoy
his
day
of
community
repose.
so
that
even
if
those
ends
were
legitimate,
and
i
submit
that
they
are
not,
there's
not
evidence
in
this
case
even
though
a
very
long
history
of
legislation
specifically
permitting
sunday
operations
that
it
is
necessary
to
enforce
this
kind
of
law
against
these
kinds
of
people.
i
would
like
to
return
just
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
legislative
objectives.
we
have
to
weigh
in
a
first
amendment
case,
ultimately
the
needs
of
society
against
the
--
against
the
rights
of
the
individuals
involved.
as
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
yesterday,
if
there
are
no
first
amendment
freedoms
involved
in
a
case,
then
all
we
are
left
with
are
the
civil
liberties
of
anybody
to
--
to
work
--
make
productive
use
of
seven
days
a
week.
now
if
that's
what
we're
left
with,
and
if
the
legislative
end
is
a
weekly
respite
from
work
then
even
though
--
even
one
day
and
seven
statute
will
limit
the
right
of
an
individual
to
work
seven
days
instead
of
six,
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
the
interest
of
society
in
protecting
its
members
is
subordinated
to
the
interest
of
an
individual
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
exclusively
to
work
seven
days
a
week.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
that
is
a
more
difficult
question.
that
is
a
more
difficult
question
but
it
may
very
well
be
that
even
that
--
even
that
in
first
amendment
so
to
speak
right,
could
be
subordinated
to
the
community's
need
to
make
sure
that
all
citizens
rest
periodically.
i
won't
concede
it.
there
is
no
such
religion
to
my
knowledge
but
that
would
raise
a
very
interesting
question.
but
nevertheless,
as
i
think
it
has
been
demonstrated,
uniformity
of
day
is
not
necessary
to
accomplish
that
legitimate
social
end.
now,
i
say
to
this
court
that
if
we
are
talking
about
the
other
objectives
of
family
life
and
community
tranquility,
if
they
are
the
legislative
objectives,
then
i
ask
this
court
to
consider
very
carefully,
the
substantiality
of
those
needs.
it
--
and
i
think
the
court
has
to
independently
do
so
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
is
there
such
a
crying
need
in
our
society
for
families
to
be
together
all
on
one
day?
won't
they
be
together
even
without
such
a
statute?
is
there
a
need
in
order
for
a
man
to
enjoy
his
day
of
rest
to
have
entire
community
repose?
is
this
really
a
--
such
a
wavy
consideration
that
the
rights
of
these
small
groups
can
be
subordinated
for
those
kinds
of
objectives?
and
in
considering
and
in
weighing
the
substantiality
of
those
reasons
against
the
rights
of
these
individuals,
i
would
ask
this
court
to
consider
the
fact
that
these
so-called
new
recently
advanced
social
ends
or
community
repose
will
be
achieved
at
the
expense
of
cultural
diversity
in
our
society.
after
all,
these
people
are
working
on
sunday,
they
are
hurting
no
one.
the
fact
that
they
are
working
on
sunday
is
merely
a
cultural
manifestation
of
their
efforts
and
the
efforts
of
their
fathers
before
them
to
make
a
living
and
support
themselves
and
the
--
and
their
families
while
at
the
same
time,
clinging
to
the
faith
of
their
fathers.
now,
many
have
complained
in
our
society
of
the
subtle,
the
powerful
pressures
towards
conformity
in
our
economic,
social
and
political
life.
i
would
just
say
this
that
those
few
people,
those
few
groups
in
our
society
who
are
attempting
to
resist
cultural
engulfment,
should
be
permitted
to
do
so
and
should
be
permitted
to
influence
or
try
to
influence
their
children
and
others
that
their
ways
are
right
and
that
their
ways
are
best.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
right
to
be
culturally
different
rises
to
the
exaltation
of
a
first
amendment
freedom.
i
am
merely
saying
that
during
the
weighing
process
that
this
court
must
inevitably
undergo
in
this
kind
of
a
case
that
into
the
scale
should
go,
the
positive
benefits
flowing
from
a
pluralistic
society
and
cultural
pluralism.
because
i
think
that
that
consideration
was
in
the
scale,
so
to
speak,
in
several
cases
before
this
court
in
the
past.
for
example,
in
meyer
versus
nebraska
and
in
several
other
cases
like
it,
there
are
the
foreign
language
cases
where
the
state
legislature
forbade
the
teaching
of
a
foreign
language
until
the
eighth
grade.
and
this
court
held,
although
there
was
obviously
no
first
amendment
freedom
involved,
that
for
the
purposes
of
creating
uniformity,
this
is
not
a
legitimate
end
for
civil
legislation.
i
would
answer
one
question
before
i
sit
down,
that
was
raised
yesterday
by
justice
whittaker
concerning
the
colonial
legislature
of
massachusetts,
i
think
it
was,
merely
by
saying
because
i
--
i
think
it's
important
that
this
be
kept
in
mind.
that
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
there
was
establishment
in
quite
a
few
states
in
the
union.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
an
established
church,
well
into
the
19th
century
in
massachusetts
and
elsewhere
and
that
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
the
first
amendment
was
only
considered
to
be
a
--
a
proscription
against
the
national
congress
establishing
a
church.
it
certainly
was
not
considered
to
be
a
proscription
of
any
kind
against
the
state
legislatures.
that
was
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
--
and
the
judicial
interpretations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
followed
it.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
yes,
and
i
--
i
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
--
i
would
say
--
i
would
say
the
practical
answer
to
that,
sir.
i
wonder
how
many
sabbatarians
there
were
in
virginia
at
the
time
that
that
--
that
that
took
place.
in
other
words,
perhaps
the
religious
significance
of
these
kind
of
laws
do
not
become
so
apparent
in
a
society
which
is
at
least
religiously
agreed
on
this
point
of
sunday
observance
for
religious
reasons.
when
however
we
have
a
changing
society
and
there
are
people
throughout
the
country
who
observe
another
day
of
the
week,
then
it's
in
those
situations
that
religious
laws
become
more
apparent.
for
example,
it's
--
it
must
be
so
that
--
that
there
was
release
time
in
the
public
schools
a
long,
long
time
before
the
1948
or
1949
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
would
--
i
--
i
--
as
i
understand
the
jewish
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
don't
have
any
doubt
that
there
was
a
jewish
community.
i
would
say
that
it
must
have
been
a
mighty
small
one.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
numbers
did
not
matter.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
no,
but
i
--
i'm
only
raising
the
questions
of
numbers
in
answer
to
your
question,
sir.
i'm
saying
that
where
there
is
several
jews
in
a
community
of
--
of
thousand
or
hundreds
of
thousands
that
it
may
not
appear
to
the
christian
that
a
blue
law
is
religious
because
nobody
raised
anything.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
no,
he
was
not
preoccupied
with
the
problem
of
blue
law.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
oh,
i
said
of
blue
laws,
i'm
sorry,
you
--
of
course
he
was
occupied
and
apparently
the
blue
law
problem
never
--
never
came
into
anybody's
mind
because
it
has
become
a
serious
problem
of
recent
years,
after
all
blue
laws
were
virtually
never
enforced
against
people
who
observe
another
day
of
the
week.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
am
not.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
i
am
not.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
of
course
that
law
does
not
forbid
him,
it
does
technically.
it
does,
i
should
say
practically.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
he
can't
file
a
paper
because
it
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
he
can't
do
that
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
that's
right.
he
--
he
--
i
would
put
him
in
the
same
category
as
a
customer
who
can't
shop
on
a
certain
day
that
he'd
like
to
shop.
they're
not
forbidding
him,
they
simply
closed
the
establishment.
and
the
question
of
whether
he
has
a
right
to
stop
them
from
closing
down
the
establishments
so
--
so
that
he
could
practice
the
way
he
wanted
to
raises
different
considerations
--
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
--
and
this
kind
of
case
does.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
because
they
are
not
--
they
are
not
passing
legislation
which
forbids
him
to
do
anything.
they
are
merely
--
it
would
be
like
a
store
which
voluntarily
closes
on
four
days
a
week
and
limits
a
person's
right
to
shop.
in
any
event,
i
would
argue
that
this
is
a
de
minimis
consideration,
not
affecting
as
substantially
as
this
legislation
obviously
does.
it
does
not
put
the
man
to
a
choice
of
going
out
of
business
or
giving
up
his
religious
faith.
and
it
--
that
--
that
would
be
another
answer.
there
are
a
lot
of
examples
in
our
society
of
a
certain
amount
of
historical
religious
symbolism
that
fall
under
the
category
or
umbrella
of
de
minimis,
i
suppose,
because
they
hardly
or
ever
or
are
never
or
perhaps
never
maybe
challenged
in
court.
mr.
theodore
r.
mann
well,
if
--
to
return
to
the
question
of
mohammedans,
i
would
say
that
any
sunday
law
could
not
be
enforced
against
the
mohammedans
where
exactly
the
right,
the
same
reasons
that
it
cannot
be
enforced
against
jews
and
sabbatarians.
i
would
say
that
a
sunday
law
with
an
exemption
in
it
for
the
seventh
day
wouldn't
cure
anything
so
far
as
the
muslim
is
concerned
and
could
not
be
enforced
against
him.
his
rights,
despite
the
numerical
insignificance
rise
exactly
to
the
same
height
as
everyone
else's
does.
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
it'd
be
--
if
the
task
falls
to
these
very
small
sects
and
sometimes
on
popular
sects
to
test
the
religious
freedom
in
our
land.
