warren
number
67,
abraham
braunfeld
et
al.,
appellants,
versus
albert
n.
brown,
commissioner
of
police
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
et
al.
mr.
mann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
the
law
provides
in
most
states
that
the
courthouses
are
closed
on
saturday
afternoon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
a
man
cannot
file
a
legal
complaint
or
transact
any
business
with
the
government
because
of
the
fact
that
they've
declared
that
they
shall
be
closed
on
saturdays.
now,
would
you
say
that
because
a
man
is
a
christian
and
observes
sunday
as
his
day
of
worship
that
--
that
the
law
is
invalid
because
it
prevents
him
from
half
a
day
of
practicing
law
on
saturday
where
those
of
the
jewish
faith
can
practice
all
day,
saturday.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
know
but
they
can
practice
--
they
can
practice
if
they
want
but
the
--
the
christian
--
christian
can't
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
saturday
afternoon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
some
--
let's
say
there's
some
other
--
some
other
group
that
can.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
--
let's
--
i
--
i
think
i
chose
a
bad
example
because
under
your
--
under
the
religion
of
the
orthodox
jews,
they
can't
--
they
couldn't
practice
on
saturday
either
but
--
but
let's
say
that
--
i
think
it
was
stated
here
yesterday
that
some
religious
faith
practices
its
religious
ceremonies
on
tuesday.
i
have
forgotten
what
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
--
on
friday.
well,
now,
would
have
a
right
to
complain
that
because
the
--
the
court
is
closed
on
saturday
that
--
that
they
couldn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
--
i
think
that's
bad
example,
don’t
pursue
it
any
further.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mann,
let
me
--
let
me
please
get
back
to
that
question
i
asked
you
a
moment
ago
and
i’ll
put
this
way.
a
man
is
a
mohammedan.
he
practices
law.
he
cannot,
under
his
religion,
practice
on
fridays.
the
state,
by
law
closes
the
courthouses
on
the
jewish
holiday
of
saturday
and
on
the
christian
holiday
of
sunday.
is
that
man
deprived
of
due
process
or
equal
protect
of
the
laws
and
that
he
can
only
practice
four
days
a
week?
monday,
tuesday,
wednesday
and
thursday
where
the
others
can
--
can
practice
for
five
days?
chief
justice
earl
warren
technically,
he
can't
file
a
paper,
he
can't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
can't
try
a
lawsuit.
he
can't
do
anything
--
he
can't
do
anything
in
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
anything
at
the
courthouse.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
different
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
you
--
when
you
place
this
on
economic
grounds,
the
loss
to
these
people,
why
is
that
different
in
his
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
because
there
are
so
few
mohammedans?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
berger.
