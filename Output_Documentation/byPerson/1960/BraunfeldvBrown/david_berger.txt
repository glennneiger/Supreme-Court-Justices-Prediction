mr.
david
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
honorable
members
of
this
court.
i
think
the
last
question
of
the
chief
justice
pretty
well
epitomizes
the
present
question
now
before
the
court.
there
is
no
aid
as
a
result
of
the
particular
rule
which
the
chief
justice
referred
to.
it
does
not
establish
a
religion
and
in
my
judgment,
it
does
not
prohibit
the
free
exercise
thereof.
and
i
think
that
when
we
come
to
analyze
this
particular
statute
before
the
court,
we
will
see
that
any
harm,
economic
or
otherwise
which
flows
to
the
mohammedan
trial
lawyer,
is
one
which
is
in
direct,
not
immediate,
consequential
and
i
would
say,
personal.
and
one
which
is
not,
on
the
other
hand,
direct,
immediate
and
universally
applicable
to
all
mohammedans
but
i
will
develop
that
in
the
course
of
my
presentation.
i
think
it's
important
in
this
case
especially
because
in
the
--
like
the
argument
yesterday
on
the
massachusetts
law,
we
--
it
appeared
to
me
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
substantially
different
question.
as
mr.
mann
pointed
out,
the
only
law
here
before
your
honors
at
this
moment,
is
the
act
of
1959
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
which
appears
in
full
at
page
17
of
this
raw
transcript
of
record.
and
i
would
hope
that
your
honors
would
be
good
enough
to
refer
to
that
because
it
is
only
by
referring
to
this
act
and
knowing
precisely
what
we
are
here
considering,
will
we
be
able
to
reach
what
i
hope
would
be
the
proper
decision.
this
act,
you
will
note,
is
not
a
general
law,
it's
not
a
day
of
rest
statute
and
it
is
--
if
anything,
a
day
off
statute.
and
in
my
judgment,
this
is
not
a
first
amendment
case
at
all
and
no
number
of
repetitions
of
the
phrase
"first
amendment,"
or
the
basic
rules
with
which
all
of
us
are
familiar
will
make
it
a
first
amendment
case.
if
you'll
read
the
statute,
you
will
see
as
i
do
that
all
it
does,
and
that's
all
that
these
plaintiffs
are
complaining
about
this
act,
no
other
act,
they
want
an
injunction
to
restrain
us
from
forcing
this
act,
is
to
amend
a
general
penal
code
of
pennsylvania.
this
doesn't
go
back
to
1682.
no
ancient
observance
of
any
religious
right
is
here
involved.
this
is
a
1959
statute.
the
pressures
behind
what
are
so
fresh
in
our
minds
that
we
can
tell
you
that
religion
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
its
passage.
what
does
it
do?
it
penalizes
the
sale
at
retail
of
only
certain
items
or
commodities
and
it
penalizes
these
sales
very
heavily
unlike
other
statutes
of
pennsylvania
which
are
not
here
at
issue.
now,
why
was
it
passed?
it
was
passed
for
sociological
and
economic
reasons.
as
the
briefs
of
the
retail
clerks
pointed
out,
the
retail
industry
is
the
second
largest
in
the
united
states
in
terms
of
numbers
employed.
this
is
an
industry
where
unless
you
have
a
uniform
mandatory
day
off,
your
honors,
the
people
who
work
in
that
industry,
the
individual
entrepreneurs
are
just
not
going
to
get
a
day
off.
the
competition
in
this
kind
of
industry
has
been
aptly
described
as
atomistic.
it
is
--
there
is
no
measure
of
control
over
the
market
in
the
sense
that
if
a
groups
of
entrepreneurs
should
take
sunday
off
for
example,
that
this
would
cause
competitors
to
do
likewise.
on
the
contrary,
what
happens
is
that
the
competition
is
so
atomized
here
that
it
works
like
a
chain
reaction.
if
one
retailer
keeps
open
on
sunday,
this
essentially
triggers
off
a
series
of
other
retailers.
now
the
retail
clerks
pointed
out
and
i
think
quite
correctly,
that
the
employees
in
this
industry
are
not
completely
unionized
and
that's
certainly
an
understatement.
we
know
that
actually,
it
--
it
is
hardly
unionized,
but
they
say
that
even
with
regard
of
the
segment
of
that
industry
which
is
unionized
that
there
is
no
way
for
them
to
get
sunday
as
a
day
off.
moreover,
they
point
out
that
the
–
bulk
of
the
employees
were
not
unionized,
have
virtually
no
bargaining
power
with
their
employers
and
hence,
they
can't
even
get
a
day
off,
much
less
a
common
or
uniform
day
off.
mr.
david
berger
no,
sir.
we
do
not.
and
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
this
act
was
standard
for
--
as
it
is.
we
have
no
exceptions
here
but
it
is
applicable
to
a
reasonable
and
in
my
judgment,
large
class
of
employees
and
individual
entrepreneurs.
now,
the
retail
merchants
at
the
state
level,
at
the
national
level
have
filed
briefs
and
they
too
point
out
the
essential
need
for
a
common
day
off.
now,
we
don't
say
this
is
a
day
of
rest.
that
if
your
honors
will
look
at
this,
the
--
you
honors
will
agree
with
me
that
they
find
small
orthodox
jewish
merchants
who
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
are
not
in
any
way
penalized.
if
they'd
go
to
their
stores
and
they
do
all
of
the
things
which
must
be
done
in
the
conducting
of
a
retail
business
such
as
taking
inventory,
fixing
displays,
having
sales
meetings,
making
their
plans
for
the
following
day.
i
know
as
an
orthodox
jew
that
this
violates
the
strict
sabbatarian
obligation
of
the
orthodox
jews.
they
cannot
do
that
on
saturday.
they
may
not
do
that
from
friday
sundown
to
saturday
night.
but
they
are
permitted
to
do
these
things
under
this
law.
the
one
thing
they
may
not
do
is,
sell
to
the
public.
now,
the
reason
for
that
are
the
reasons,
sociological
reasons
which
i
have
mentioned,
the
economic
loss.
there
is
a
further
economic
reason
which
is
of
great
importance
in
the
passage
of
this
legislation.
pennsylvania,
as
so
many
of
our
large
industrial
states,
has
a
problem
of
--
which
is
essentially
concerned
with
an
imbalance
between
the
large
cities
and
the
core
areas
of
our
large
cities
and
the
suburban
areas.
in
philadelphia
for
example,
a
large
part
of
our
wealth
is
concentrated
in
the
large
department
stores.
we
know
and
the
court
certainly
can
take
judicial
notice
to
this
fact
that
there
has
been
a
flight
to
the
suburbs.
you
will
have
--
developed
in
the
1950s,
1950s
as
tendency
to
get
away
from
the
big
department
store,
john
wanamaker.
john
wanamaker
deteriorates
the
extent
that
we
have
a
fragmentation
with
the
--
all
kinds
of
suburban
shopping
centers
taking
over.
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
in
a
very
sad
position.
now,
we
are
now
taking
positive
steps
to
remedy
that
and
the
legislature
had
before
it,
not
merely
the
flight
of
philadelphia
but
pittsburg,
allentown
and
in
the
next
case,
you'll
see
it,
your
honors,
there's
no
question
or
religion
involved.
two
guys
from
harrison,
you've
got
that
problem
there
as
to
whether
or
not
the
legislature
had
a
right
or
power,
and
that's
always
before
this
court.
was
it
legitimately
within
the
legislative
power
of
pennsylvania
to
say
that
with
respect
to
this
group
of
items
and
this
group
of
retail
sellers
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
penalty
if
they
did
the
--
this
on
sunday
where
as
judge
hasty
pointed
out
when
he
dismissed
the
appeal,
the
challenge
to
the
constitutionality.
these
are
the
very
items
which
the
suburban
discount
houses
were
selling.
these
are
the
very
items
which
triggered
off
these
sunday
sales
and
which
caused
the
various
employees
in
the
retail
business
not
to
get
sunday
off.
now,
why
do
they
want
sunday
off
is
the
answer
also
in
the
brief
of
the
retail
clerks
and
also
of
the
merchants.
they
say
that
sunday
has
become
a
nonreligious
day.
it
has
a
unique
significance
in
america
today.
now,
i
could
concede
that
in
the
early
days,
colonial
days,
the
sunday
laws
may
have
been
passed
for
that
--
for
the
religious
purposes
but
that's
irrelevant
to
the
consideration
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
law.
in
1959
when
this
law
was
passed
in
pennsylvania
and
i
dare
say
all
over
the
united
states,
sunday
had
attained
an
unusual
significance.
it
was
the
day
when
the
great
football
games
were
played,
professional
football
games.
it
was
a
day
when
you
saw
“face
the
nation”
on
the
television,
and
the
other
great
television
programs.
it
was
the
day
when
most
people
wanted
to
go
to
the
beach.
it
is
the
day
when
the
municipal
and
private
golf
courses
are
swarming
with
doffers.
it
is
a
--
it's
a
day
which
some
ministers
have
contended
has
become
completely
nonreligious
and
indeed
we
have
even
had
complaints
from
some
who
say
that
the
result
of
a
statute
will
be
to
interfere
with
religion
because
you're
giving
day
off
and
this
is
--
together
with
their
family
will
result
in
their
engaging
in
completely
nonreligious
activities.
if
we
need,
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
labor
this
point
but
if
we
need
any
further
demonstration
of
the
fact
that
religion
is
not
involved
here
at
all,
let
us
consider
this.
the
day
off
which
the
legislature
in
pennsylvania
believes
will
result
from
this
is
in
no
way
conditioned
upon
a
religious
observance.
it
is
untrue
that
if
anyone
suggests
that
i
deny
it,
that
an
orthodox
jew
who
will
refrain
from
selling
to
the
public
on
sunday
in
any
way,
shape
or
form,
either
violates
his
religious
tenets
or
observes
the
tenets
of
some
other
religion.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
in
this
case,
it
is
clear
beyond
any
question
that
if
the
retail
employees
and
the
individual
entrepreneurs
who
are
small
retailers,
if
they
are
to
get
sunday
off
because
this
statute
should
be
declared
constitutional,
they'll
get
sunday
off
even
if
they
use
it
to
play
golf.
now,
considering
the
other
hand,
your
zorach
decision
in
which
the
majority
of
this
court
upheld
a
time
off
case
in
the
school
system.
now,
there,
it
was
interesting
because
the
time
off
could
only
be
obtained
in
the
first
instance
if
you
use
that
and
proved
you
used
it
for
religious
observance.
in
this
case,
there's
no
connection
whatsoever
between
the
use
that
you
make
of
the
time
off,
the
day
off
you
get
from
the
statute
and
religion.
and
so
i
say
to
your
honors
that
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
sensation
of
work,
day
of
rest.
this
is
simply
an
economic
and
sociological
statute
and
therefore
in
my
judgment,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
situation
involving
the
establishment
of
religion.
i
think
that
point
will
further
be
developed
in
the
next
case.
now,
we
come
to
the
second
branch
of
the
religious
argument
and
the
argument
made
by
these
five
plaintiffs
is
that
regardless
of
the
fact
which
i
gather
they
concede
that
this
was
an
economically
based
law.
it
does
have
such
an
effect
as
to
cause
this
court
to
bring
into
play
the
--
the
great
weight
of
the
first
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
even
assuming
arguendo
that
the
first
amendment
has
been
incorporated
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
both
branches,
it
is
my
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
i’ve
been
talking
about
that
--
mr.
david
berger
i
say
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
i
have
no
doubt
either,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
i
say
that
there
is
no
interference
with
the
free
exercise
of
religion
as
a
result
of
pennsylvania's
act
of
1959.
now,
when
you
analyze
this,
you'll
find
that
you're
not
here
dealing
with
any
actual
interference
with
the
practice
of
religion
or
the
statement
or
a
holding
of
a
religious
belief.
you
don't
have
anything
by
way
of
a
license.
for
example,
in
your
jehovah's
witnesses
cases,
the
majority
of
this
court
struck
down
the
--
the
laws
because
there,
in
order
to
practice
your
religion,
you
had
to
pay
a
license
fee
and
the
court
said
you
can't
do
that.
you
can't
force
a
man
to
pay
money
in
order
to
practice
his
own
religion.
you
don’t
have
any
proficient
here.
you
don't
have
the
law
saying
that
you
may
not
observe
your
own
sabbath
or
if
you're
a
muslim,
your
own
friday
or
if
you're
a
buddhist
and
i
think
the
question
was
asked
yesterday
whether
there
were
any
other
days
of
the
week
which
were
celebrated
and
my
research
reveals
that
the
buddhist
have
a
--
a
floating
or
rotating
day
and
it
depends
upon
the
phases
of
the
moon
as
a
result
of
which
it
could
be
said
that
no
matter
how
you
work
it
out
mathematically,
it
is
impossible
to
select
a
uniform
mandatory
day
off
which
won't,
under
their
argument
if
this
court
accepts
it,
either
prefer
or
harm
some
religion.
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
gone
that
far
and
moreover,
it
does
not
say
--
it
does
not
command
them
to
do
something
which
they
are
not
permitted
to
do
under
the
--
under
religious
tenets.
mr.
david
berger
i
would
have
to
agree
if
that
were
the
design,
sir,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
and
you
have,
for
example,
in
a
--
in
a
case
of
vaccination,
i
think
you
honor
is
familiar
with
the
--
the
--
justice's
holmes
famous
decision
in
the
jacobson
case.
there,
christian
scientist,
by
virtue
of
their
religion,
cannot
be
vaccinated
but
they
had
to
be
vaccinated.
now,
there
you
had
a
--
a
different
kind
of
situation
where
you
take
your
polygamy
cases
where
some
people
believe,
the
mormons
at
that
time
believed
that
as
part
of
their
religious
observance,
they
should
have
more
than
one
spouse.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
said
that
the
religious
law
naturally
has
to
be
subservient
to
a
universally
applicable
civil
or
nonreligious
law.
now,
i
think
we
come
to
the
nub
of
the
case
where
we
ask
this
question
well
is
there
any
economic
impact
whatsoever
on
these
five
plaintiffs,
orthodox
jews?
now,
i
am
going
to
concede
before
the
bar
of
this
court
that
there
is
an
economic
impact.
i
do
not
deny
that,
but
we
must
examine
very
carefully
what
kind
of
economic
impact
it
is.
does
it
come
because
the
law,
in
any
way,
prohibits
them
from
exercising
their
religion?
no.
as
i
explained
it,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that.
the
--
it
--
it
is
something
which
is
neither
direct
nor
immediate
but
on
the
contrary,
it
is
consequential
and
it
is
more
than
that,
it
isn't
even
universally
applicable
because
not
all
orthodox
jews
will
suffer
economic
impact
as
a
result
of
this
kind
of
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
it
isn't
in
our
statute
but
just
hypothetically,
the
kosher
butchers
and
i'm
surprised
this
wasn't
raised
yesterday,
a
kosher
butcher
shop
deals
with
the
people
who
will
by
kosher
meat.
now,
kosher,
i
can
conceive
of
many
kosher
butchers
who
would
like
to
have
a
five-day
week
because
their
customers
are
people
who
must
buy
from
them
so
that
they
would
suffer
no
economic
impact
if
for
example,
that
were
included
in
the
commodities.
i
point
that
out
to
show
that
the
economic
impact
which
i
concede
here
is
of
such
nature
that
it
is
personal
to
the
individuals
and
relates
primarily
to
the
--
their
voluntary
entry
to
this
particular
type
of
business.
it's
like
the
mohammedan
trial
there
and
i
say
that
this
kind
of
economic
impact
clearly
does
not
come
within
the
protected
arm
of
the
first
amendment.
and
i
say
--
mr.
david
berger
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
david
berger
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor
that
where
it
becomes
a
matter
of
degree
that
where
the
impact
is
personal
and
dependent
upon
not
the
religion
you
observe
but
all
of
it
--
of
the
kind
of
work
you're
doing,
nonreligious
work
you're
doing,
that
in
that
situation,
i
don't
think
this
is
kind
of
impact
which
the
court
has
in
mind.
i
think
all
those
who
--
if
you
had
to
pay
a
license
fee
to
practice
orthodox
judaism
or
any
other
kind
of
religion
that
would
affect
all
of
that
faith.
this
is
not
only
an
--
an
economic
impact
which
is
not
felt
by
others
of
the
same
religious
group,
but
if
your
honors
please,
it
maybe
felt
even
more
by
those
who
are
not
in
this
religious
group
and
indeed,
who
are
not
in
any
religious
group.
as
your
honors
will
note
from
the
next
case,
two
guys
from
harrison
deals
with
one
of
these
suburban
discount
houses.
they
are
open
seven
days
a
week.
there
is
no
question
of
--
their
of
--
their
observing
any
religion
and
yet,
they
claim,
and
i
suppose
the
record
would
support
this
claim
that
they're
dependent
upon
the
sales
they
make
on
sunday
and
without
that,
they
say,
they
are
going
out
of
business.
now,
i’m
pointing
that
out
of
course
it
seems
to
me
that
that
irrefutably
demonstrates
that
the
nature
of
the
economic
impact
as
against
these
five
orthodox
jews
is
one
which
is
personal
to
them
and
cannot
be
the
basis
for
striking
down
a
law
on
the
ground
that
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
david
berger
we
--
mr.
david
berger
we
have
two
answers
to
that.
we
have
--
number
one,
we
have
a
serious
doubt
in
our
minds
whether
that
in
itself
would
not
be
the
preference
giving
a
preferential
treatment
to
a
particular
religion
or
to
all
religions
and
i
think
this
court
has
gone
so
far
in
--
in
the
celebrated
trinity
of
everson
and
mccollum
and
zorach
to
say
that
you
cannot
favor
a
particular
sect
of
religion
or
all
religion
against
the
nonreligious.
that
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
and
the
law
might
call
upon
the
question.
we
don't
have
it
in
pennsylvania
but
it
would
seem
to
me
there
are
some
serious
doubt
whether
an
exemption
such
as
your
honors
suggest,
would
not
itself
be
violative
of
the
first
amendment
because
for
this
--
mr.
david
berger
no,
i
don't.
mr.
david
berger
that's
right.
i
agree
with
your
honor
there
and
i
feel
the
second
point
is,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
fact
that
there
might
be
available
to
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania,
an
alternative,
namely
the
putting
in
of
an
exemption
might
be
something
to
be
addressed
to
the
legislature,
but
that
certainly
would
be
no
basis
for
striking
down
this
law
and
i
think
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
in
the
celebrated
everson
opinion.
the
mere
fact
that
a
--
a
state
law
favors
or
not
favors,
but
coincides
with
the
personal
wishes
of
many
people,
is
no
basis
for
striking
it
down.
and
so
i
would
come
back
to
that.
the
mere
fact
that
a
mandatory
day
off
would
coincide
with
a
sunday
which
most
people
want
from
both
religious
and
no
religious
and
a
variety
of
reasons
would
be
no
--
no
basis
whatsoever
for
striking
it
down.
mr.
david
berger
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
and
we
are
here
with
--
confront
it
with
the
question
in
this
act
of
a
non-exempting
statute,
applicable
only
to
certain
retailers
who
sell
certain
items.
mr.
david
berger
now,
it
is
because
of
this
analysis
that
we
have
concluded
that,
number
one,
there
is
no
establishment
of
a
religion
at
all.
there
is
no
religious
origin,
purpose
or
effect
here.
number
two,
there
is
no
prohibition
against
the
free
exercise
of
any
religion.
now,
and
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
case
boils
down
under
the
all
common
garden
variety
fourteenth
amendment
case
is
this
--
is
there
something
about
this
which
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
think
the
best
answer
to
that
and
very
frankly,
that's
the
reason
we
didn't
labor
the
point,
can
be
found
in
--
in
circuit
court
of
appeals,
judge
hasty's
opinion
on
that
point.
and
in
that
case,
it's
printed
that
the
--
the
relevant
portion
of
his
opinion
will
be
found
on
page
13
and
14
of
my
brief.
that's
the
--
the
--
we
call
brief,
white
brief
there.
in
this,
he
points
out
the
reasons
why
and
they
were
intensely
practical.
the
legislature
didn't
go
off,
off
the
fact
there.
they
picked
out
these
particular
items
because
as
judge
hasty
pointed
out,
these
were
the
very
items
which
large
discount
houses
were
selling
as
which
were
triggering
off
the
series
of
competitive
sales
on
sunday.
and
that
was
the
reason
why
the
department
stores
and
the
labor
unions
supported
this
particular
kind
of
statute.
so
that
once
you
get
a
--
once
you
grade,
as
i
believe
you
should,
that
regardless
of
massachusetts
thought
that
this
particular
act
in
1959
does
not
involve
the
first
amendment,
then
i
think
you
must
also
agree
that
the
attack
on
the
grounds
of
the
equal
protections
fails
because
there
is
an
economic
basis.
and
i
would
never
attempt
to
justify
these
myriad
of
exceptions
on
ground
--
religious
grounds.
i'm
saying
that
they're
justifiable
because
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
of
how
to
meet
the
economic
and
social
need
which
i
have
described.
it
maybe
that
--
that
some
of
the
justices
would
disagree
with
the
legislators
but
that's
not
the
test
of
constitutionality
and
it
is
certainly
not
without
rhyme
or
reason
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out.
where
the
legislature
acts
along
as
it
isn't
without
rhyme
or
reason,
this
court
isn't
going
to
strike
down
its
actions
simply
because
alternatives
exist
or
because
it
might
take
a
slightly
different
route
to
that
particular
end.
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
just
one
other
word,
although
it
hasn't
been
raised,
i
think
in
the
arguments
yesterday,
some
of
the
justices
did
raise
the
question
of
police
power.
i
don't
think
there's
any
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
police
power
clause.
i
think
that
--
i
--
fourteenth
amendment,
i
believe
that
this
is
a
valid
exercise
of
pennsylvania's
police
power.
and
therefore,
you
don't
have
the
normal
due
process
clause.
i
understand
it
has
been
argued
or
will
be
argued
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
select
quite
apart
from
religious
grounds,
a
uniform
mandatory
day
off.
we
couldn't
be
more
in
disagreement.
we
say
that
whereas
here,
there
are
sociological
and
economic
basis
for
a
uniform
mandatory
day
off
such
as
i
have
described
in
pennsylvania.
that
then,
that
is
a
legitimate
basis
for
the
operation
of
pennsylvania
or
other
state's
police
power.
we
think
in
the
end,
this
case
can
be
summarized
on
a
religious
point
by
what
circuit
judge
learned
hand
said
in
the
famous
atwood
case
at
205
f.2d,
cited
in
my
brief
and
if
your
honors
will
indulge
me,
i
would
like
just
to
read
this
because
it
summarizes
my
own
philosophy.
the
first
amendment
said
learned
hand,
judge
hand,
protects
one
against
action
by
the
government.
though
even
then,
not
in
all
circumstances,
but
it
gives
no
one
the
right
to
insist
that
in
the
pursuit
of
their
own
interest,
others
must
conform
their
conduct
to
his
own
religious
necessities.
a
man
might
find
it
incompatible
with
his
conscience
to
live
in
a
city
in
which
open
saloons
were
licensed
and
yet
he
would
have
no
constitutional
right
to
insist
that
the
saloons
must
be
closed.
he
would
have
to
leave
the
city
or
put
up
with
the
iniquitous
thence
no
matter
what
economic
loss,
his
change
of
domicile
entailed.
we
must
accommodate
our
idiosyncrasies,
religious
as
well
as
secular
to
the
compromises
necessary
in
communal
life.
now
we
can
hope
for
no
reward
for
the
sacrifices.
this
may
require
beyond
our
satisfaction
from
within
or
our
expectations
of
a
better
world.
thank
you.
