mr.
rowland
watts
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
now
before
you,
frank
wilkinson
versus
the
united
states,
you
have
already
heard
considerable
about
in
the
argument
earlier
today.
i
will
not
burden
the
court
by
repetition
of
that
argument
except
insofar
as
the
court
desires
or
it
becomes
pertinent
to
the
case
of
frank
wilkinson.
frank
wilkinson
was
indicted
under
2
u.s.c.
192
for
contempt
to
the
congress
for
refusal
to
answer
a
single
question.
so
his
case
is
simplified
by
the
fact
that
there
is
only
a
single
count
upon
which
the
court
below
ruled.
frank
wilkinson
had
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
in
atlanta
in
july
of
1958.
this
committee
had,
as
its
directive
from
the
full
committee,
the
subcommittee,
three
purposes
to
investigate
colonizing
activities
of
the
communist
party
in
textile
and
other
industry
in
the
south,
investigation
of
dissemination
of
foreign
political
propaganda
in
the
south,
and
investigation
of
communist
propaganda
activity
in
the
south.
mr.
wilkinson
was
subpoenaed
according
to
the
statement
of
the
counsel
for
the
committee,
on
page
30
of
the
record
and
on
page
156
of
the
record.
page
156
of
the
record
is
a
testimony
--
the
hearing
--
the
report
of
the
hearings
by
the
house
committee
and
the
156
number
is
down
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner.
it
is
information
of
the
committee
and
the
suggestion
of
the
committee
said,
"mr.
arens,
that
in
anticipation
of
the
hearings
here
in
atlanta,
georgia,
you
were
set
to
this
area
by
the
communist
party
for
the
purpose
of
developing
a
hostile
sentiment
to
the
committee
and
to
its
work
and
for
the
purpose
of
undertaking
to
bring
pressure
upon
the
united
states
congress
to
preclude
these
particular
hearings."
mr.
arens
also
stated
--
mr.
rowland
watts
oh,
it's
156
stamped
in
the
corner.
mr.
rowland
watts
it's
page
2682
of
the
committee
print.
mr.
rowland
watts
now,
there
was
no
suggestion
at
any
time
in
the
testimony
of
any
witness
before
these
particular
hearings
that
mr.
wilkinson
had
any
knowledge
of
any
of
the
stated
activities
for
which
the
subcommittee
was
authorized
to
conduct
hearings.
on
the
contrary,
there
was
no
indication
whatsoever
that
mr.
wilkinson
had
ever
been
in
the
south
at
all.
now,
mr.
arens
stated
that
he
was
not
--
mr.
wilkinson
was
not
subpoenaed
to
appear
until
the
committee
had
knowledge
that
he
was
in
atlanta.
i
suggest
on
internal
evidence
that
this
was
somewhat
inaccurate
because
that's
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
wilkinson
was
served
with
a
subpoena
on
july
23rd
within
an
hour
after
he
arrived
in
atlanta
and
that
is
shown
on
page
40
of
the
record,
the
testimonies
of
the
marshal.
and
the
subpoena
was
dated
the
preceding
day
in
washington,
dc.
therefore,
we
suggest
that
while
it
is
not
serious
that
mr.
arens
slipped
on
that
point,
it
is
clearly
indicative
of
the
fact
that
the
committee
subpoenaed
mr.
wilkinson
before
it
had
any
knowledge
whatsoever
that
he
was
in
the
south
at
all,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
before
he
actually
was
in
the
south.
therefore,
it
was
not
possible
for
the
committee
to
consider
within
the
framework
of
its
three
stated
purposes,
any
testimony
by
mr.
wilkinson,
and
in
answer
to
a
parallel
question
if
concerning
mr.
braden
this
morning.
there
is
no
testimony
in
the
hearing
by
any
member
of
the
committee
or
by
anyone
else
that
the
committee
had
any
information
that
mr.
wilkinson
had
any
relationship
to
the
communist
party
except
the
testimony,
the
statement
of
mr.
arens,
committee
chairman
himself
to
the
effect
that
they
had
such
testimony.
now,
all
of
the
witnesses
that
appeared
before
the
committee
prior
to
the
appearance
of
mr.
wilkinson,
and
we
conceded
that
mr.
wilkinson
was
present
throughout
the
hearings,
heard
the
opening
statement
of
the
subcommittee
chairman,
and
so
forth.
all
the
preceding
witnesses
testify
those
concerning
matter
that
had
some
relationship
to
the
purpose
of
the
subcommittee's
hearings.
mr.
penha,
a
favorable
witness
to
the
government,
testified,
as
you
heard
this
morning,
in
identical
fashion
to
what
he
had
testified
in
boston
earlier.
that
he
--
about
the
general
purported
colonizing
efforts
of
the
communist
party
in
the
south.
the
other
favorable
witness
to
the
committee,
mr.
fishman,
testified
as
he
had
testified
throughout
the
country
many
times
before
concerning
the
great
influx
of
allegedly
foreign
political
propaganda
from
abroad.
the
other
witnesses,
and
i
have
summarized
what
each
proceeding
one
said
in
our
brief,
testified
to
and/or
refused
to
testify
to
an
unidentified
paper
called
the
southern
newsletter
and
there
was
some
collateral
information.
but
at
no
point,
was
there
any
testimony
concerning
mr.
wilkinson's
activities
and
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
either
a
communist
or
that
he'd
ever
been
to
south
before.
or
there
was
no
indication
that
he
had
any
information
pertinent
to
this
subcommittee's
mandate.
now,
mr.
wilkinson
refused
to
answer
this
question
and
several
others
on
the
basis
that
he
considered
the
mandate
of
the
house
un-american
activities
committee,
in
proper,
violative
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
answer.
on
--
on
contrary,
in
support
of
the
constitution
and
in
support
of
conscience,
he
was
under
obligation
to
refuse
to
answer.
mr.
rowland
watts
no
--
no,
your
honor.
it
was
strictly
a
first
amendment
claim
and
a
question
of
the
mandate,
the
validity
of
the
mandate.
i
remind
you
again
as
was
done
this
morning
that
this
testimony
came
after
watkins
but
prior
to
barenblatt.
mr.
rowland
watts
the
record
--
mr.
rowland
watts
yes.
mr.
rowland
watts
right.
mr.
rowland
watts
yes,
he
was
--
he
arrived
in
atlanta
approximately
six
days
before
the
commencement
of
the
hearing.
he
arrived
in
atlanta
on
july
23rd
and
you
will
note
on
the
subpoenaed,
on
236,
it
is
dated
july
22nd
in
washington
dc.
mr.
rowland
watts
now,
regardless
of
mr.
wilkinson's
error
in
failing
to
anticipate
this
court's
decision
in
barenblatt.
this
court
said
in
barenblatt
that
the
mandate
of
the
house
committee
had
achieved
sufficient
definiteness
because
of
the
persuasive
gloss
of
legislative
history.
now,
that
maybe
true
but
there
is
no
gloss
of
legislative
or
any
other
history
that
can
justify
the
extending
of
the
limited
mandate
given
to
subcommittee
to
include
the
investigation
of
a
man
because
he
is
carrying
on
a
public
campaign
in
opposition
to
the
committee
itself.
as
mr.
arens
said,
"to
induce
the
congress
to
prevent
these
hearings,
these
particular
hearings
from
being
held."
the
court
below
ruled
that
barenblatt
was
controlling
here,
and
it
was
controlling
because
the
congress
had
the
power
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
petitioning
the
government
for
redress
of
grievance
because
it
had
the
right
to
legislate
in
the
area
of
the
lobbying
act.
and
it
supported
united
states
versus
harris
as
controlling
on
that
question.
the
court
below
further
said
something
which
is
quite
curious.
it
said
that
mr.
wilkinson,
in
carrying
on
his
campaign
to
induce
the
congress
to
abolish
the
un-american
activities
committee,
was
carrying
on
an
activity
that
was
more
--
a
greater
threat
to
the
security
of
the
country
than
that
charged
to
barenblatt.
i
don't
think
that
obviously,
it
wasn't
controlling
but
i
think
that
it
points
up
the
approach
to
this
problem
made
by
the
court
below
and
the
error
in
the
approach
made
by
it.
this
court
said
in
harris
through
mr.
chief
justice
warren
that
the
lobbying
act
must
be
very
narrowly
construed
as
was
done
there
to
avoid
the
constitutional
dangers
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
lobbying
act
is
very
--
the
word
lobbying
was
carefully
defined
to
mean
direct
communication
with
members
of
the
congress
concerning
legislation.
however,
it
specifically
excluded,
as
i
understand
it,
a
public
campaign
to
induce
members
of
congress
to
abolish
one
of
its
own
committee.
i
suggest
to
the
court
and
unless
the
court
wants
me
to
repeat,
i
will
not
repeat
what
has
been
said
this
morning
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
reconsider
barenblatt
in
the
context
of
this
case.
this
case
is
very
simple
factual.
the
government
in
its
brief
has
suggested
that
mr.
willis,
the
acting
subcommittee
chairman,
after
wilkinson
had
refused
to
testify,
said
that
one
of
one
of
the
purposes
of
a
those
hearings
was
to
investigate
the
alleged
reorganization
of
the
communist
party.
now,
this
had
never
been
suggested
before
and
the
government
sets
forth
in
its
brief
this
as
one
of
the
purposes
for
which
these
particular
hearings
were
being
held,
and
the
government
suggests
that
the
subcommittee
can
change
its
own
mandate
within
the
framework
of
the
whole
mandate
of
the
committee
anytime
it
wants
to
in
the
course
of
any
particular
hearing.
now,
if
this
suggestion
is
correct,
there
is
absolutely
no
authority,
no
control
over
a
committee
by
the
subcommittee
or
in
terms
by
the
congress
over
committee,
and
i
think
that
this
clearly
--
this
suggestion
clearly
should
be
rejected.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
justify
the
upholding
of
this
conviction.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
my
opinion
to
support
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
i
would
like
to
reserve
what
additional
time
i
have
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rowland
watts
your
--
your
honors.
so
on
the
question
of
these
traveling
witnesses,
i
refer
you
to
the
hearings
of
communist
activity
in
new
--
in
the
new
england
area
published
by
the
house
un-american
activities,
march
18th,
1958,
or
a
testimony
was
taken
on
that
date
in
which
mr.
penha
at
page
21,
28,
and
thereabouts
in
following,
discussed,
at
great
lengths,
the
colonizing
efforts
of
the
communist
party
in
the
south
specifically
in
north
and
south
carolina.
concerning
mr.
fishman,
i
refer
you
to
page
112
of
the
record
in
which
the
only
reference
to
foreign
political
activity
--
propaganda
activity
in
the
south
is
mr.
arens,
“tell
us,
if
you
please,
sir,
what
type
of
mail
this
is
which
comes
into
the
southern
states?”
then
mr.
fishman
gives
the
general
testimony
he'd
given
many
times
before
and
says,
"areas
this
like
the
state
of
georgia."
and
then
later,
he
says,
"does
it
also
go
into
alabama
and
mississippi?"
and
he
says,
“yes.”
the
only
thing
that
has
any
possible
bearing
on
the
south
is
the
statement
in
passing
the
percentage
of
material
sent
here
is
far
less
than
it
is
in
some
of
the
northern
states.
now,
i
suggest
that
that
was
not
very
worthwhile
testimony
to
bring
mr.
fishman
down
from
new
york
to
give
in
atlanta.
as
far
as
mr.
wilkinson
is
concerned,
the
committee
practically
treats
him
like
a
traveling
witness
also,
because
in
fact,
he
had
been
subpoenaed
and
appeared
before
the
committee
18
months
previously
in
los
angeles,
was
asked,
basically
the
same
question
and
gave,
basically
the
same
answer.
i
suggest
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
bringing
mr.
wilkinson
subpoenaing
him
at
atlanta.
the
government
suggests
that
he
was
subpoenaed
there
because
it
was
a
matter
of
convenience
they
discovered
in
there.
but
what
they
wanted
to
ask
him
about
was
his
activities
against
the
committee
itself
in
his
public
campaign
against
the
committee
himself.
and
the
committee
has
not
hesitated
to
call
people
all
the
way
across
--
from
all
the
way
across
the
country
if
they
wanted
them
to
testify.
mr.
fishman,
in
his
trips
about
the
country
with
the
committee,
testified
twice
in
san
francisco.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
wilkinson
was
not
subpoenaed
for
anything
that
had
to
do
with
the
mandate
of
the
subcommittee,
the
authorization
of
the
subcommittee.
now
mr.
arens,
in
questioning
--
mr.
rowland
watts
yes.
mr.
rowland
watts
right.
mr.
rowland
watts
why
--
what
lies
in
the
minds
of
men
in
this
particular
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
a
subcommittee
of
the
--
of
the
congress
is
sent
to
the
south
to
conduct
investigation
in
three
specific
areas.
mr.
wilkinson,
who
is
well-known
to
the
committee
because
of
his
activities
in
our
position
to
the
committee,
appears
in
atlanta.
the
committee
doesn't
allege
that
it
has
any
information
concerning
him
other
than
that
he
has
been
assigned
to
carry
on
this
job
of
opposition
to
the
committee.
mr.
rowland
watts
no,
he
said
--
mr.
rowland
watts
no.
he
certainly,
doesn't
but
i
think
the
record
of
what
actually
transpired
here
--
mr.
rowland
watts
the
specific
question
that
they
wanted
to
get
from
him
was
his
activities
in
organizing
a
hostile
attitude
towards
the
house
committee
itself.
now,
this
is
recognized
in
the
court
below.
and
the
court
says
--
mr.
rowland
watts
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
rowland
watts
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
in
the
hearings
to
show
that
he
had
any
knowledge
concerning
anything
else
that
the
committee
was
mandated
to
investigate.
mr.
rowland
watts
very
well.
mr.
rowland
watts
that
refers
to
--
mr.
rowland
watts
--
to
the
testimony
given
in
--
mr.
rowland
watts
--
los
angeles.
mr.
rowland
watts
and
that
was
the
same
hearing
which
mr.
wilkinson
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
and
did
appear
and
refused
to
answer.
we
are
not
making,
as
a
primary
contention,
your
honor,
and
i'm
sorry
that
this
was
the
purpose,
although
i
recognize
what
i
may
think
the
committee
had
in
its
mind,
was
not
a
proper
question.
i
--
i
pointed
out
though
that
what
they
were
asking
him
about
and
what
they
said
they
wanted
to
ask
him
about
was
--
had
to
do
with
this
question
of
his
alleged
assignment
by
the
communist
party
to
carry
on
a
public
program
and
our
position
to
induce
the
congress
to
abolish
the
committee.
mr.
rowland
watts
i
--
i
do
not
say
that
your
honor.
i
--
i
say
that
the
subcommittee
was
not
authorized
to
do
that
with
this.
the
subcommittee
had
three
specific
purposes
given
it
by
the
committee.
and
--
mr.
rowland
watts
they
were
colonizing
an
industry
in
the
south,
foreign
political
activity
propaganda
distribution
in
the
south,
and
communist
activity
in
the
south.
mr.
rowland
watts
if
--
mr.
rowland
watts
yes
sir.
mr.
rowland
watts
i
--
mr.
rowland
watts
i
suggest
that
the
congress
--
that
the
court
below
erred
in
claiming
that
this
was
a
legitimate
area
of
investigation
by
the
committee
because
the
committee
had
not
--
the
congress
cannot
legislate
to
force
disclosure
of
motivation,
of
a
person
carrying
on
activity
to
petition
congress
for
redress
of
grievance
under
the
first
amendment,
or
at
least
this
court
stated
and
has
that
it
would
narrow
and
to
burn
lobbying
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
under
the
first
amendment
upon
--
mr.
rowland
watts
i
would
like
to
suggest
further
that
among
all
the
multitude
in
these
activities
that
this
subcommittee
was
claiming
it
had
the
power
to
investigate
in
excess
of
the
mandate
given
it
by
the
committee
itself.
one
of
them
was
this
bill
9937,
the
so-called
omnibus
bill
that
the
house
was
going
--
that
the
un-american
activities
committee
was
going
to
put
through
congress
but
it
never
did.
this
bill
was
summarized
in
part,
in
major
part
on
page
19
and
20
of
the
record
by
mr.
arens
on
direct
examination
at
the
trial.
now,
with
all
of
these
provisions
in
this
omnibus
bill,
not
one
of
them
referred
to
any
suggestion
that
the
law
being
an
act
should
be
changed.
so
they
didn't
get
their
authority
from
that.
also,
what
they
were
talking
about
was
an
amendment
to
the
smith
act
to
redefine
the
word
“organized”
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
yates.
however,
that
particular
bill
was
not
before
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
but
was
before
the
house
of
judiciary
committee
and
hearings
were
held
on
it,
and
the
judiciary
committee
did
vote
it
out,
report
it
out
that
a
week
after
these
hearings.
and
it
passed
the
house
on
august
12th,
1958.
so
the
committee,
as
i
suggested
at
the
trial,
seem
to
me
to
be
doing
a
little
colonizing
of
its
own
and
going
far
beyond
the
mandate,
the
subcommittee's
mandate
as
set
forth
in
the
resolution
establishing
it.
i
think
that
we
come
back
to
the
basic
question
which
was
raised
under
count
v
of
the
braden
case
earlier.
that
is
whether
or
not
this
was
not
impaired
beyond
the
power
of
the
committee
to
interrogate
mr.
wilkinson
because
of
his
public
activities
to
induce
the
congress
to
abolish
the
house
un-american
activities
committee.
the
court
below
raised
--
based
this
decision
squarely
on
this
point
and
it's
asserted
the
power
to
do
this.
mr.
rowland
watts
i
think
that's
no
immunity
for
--
from
interrogation
by
the
committee
in
any
other
field
than
what
is
his
motivation
in
carrying
on
a
campaign
against
the
committee.
and
i
think
there
he
gets
full
immunity
because
perhaps,
if
the
committee
is
investigating
other
legislation
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
functioning
of
congress,
i
would
say
more
than
perhaps.
i
believe
that
no
immunity
is
granted,
one
who
is
opposing
such
legislation.
but
certainly,
if
a
person
is
going
to
be
interrogated
because
of
his
opposition
to
a
functioning
of
it
--
of
a
committee
of
congress,
as
to
your
--
his
motivation,
this
is
going
to
destroy
the
right
to
petition
the
government
for
redress
of
grievance
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
rowland
watts
perhaps
so,
but
i
think
--
mr.
rowland
watts
i
--
mr.
rowland
watts
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
--
but
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
respect
but
my
answer
to
the
question
--
mr.
rowland
watts
in
our
position
to
the
committee.
mr.
rowland
watts
not
by
compulsory
process,
your
honor.
mr.
rowland
watts
isn't
--
isn't
the
--
mr.
rowland
watts
that's
right.
you
fail
--
to
find
it
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
as
mr.
chief
justice
warren
said,
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
basic
position
that
i
would
take
that
cannot
go
into
this
if
lobbying
is
going
to
be
so
defined,
but
this
subcommittee
was
not
asking
wilkinson
any
question
that
was
pertinent
to
its
mandate
because
it
was
not
investigating
lobbying.
thank
you.
