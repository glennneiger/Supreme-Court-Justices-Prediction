mr.
maroney,
do
you
understand
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
mean
that
that
court
was
relying
exclusively
on
the
subject
matter
of
opposition,
aggressive
opposition
to
the
subcommittee's
activity
by
congress
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
rather
than
--
rather
than
any
of
the
three
subjects
of
inquiry
stated.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
on
what
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
understand
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
resting
its
decision
on
that,
the
basis
of
that
purpose
of
inquiry.
justice
potter
stewart
they
don't
discuss
anything
else,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
question
--
what
were
the
questions
or
what
was
the
question
asked
in
the
watkins
case?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
watkins
case.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
it
in
mind,
i
--
i
just
--
go
on.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
never
mind,
i
have
it
here.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
--
there
is
something
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
committee
had
information
indicating
that
he
was
a
member,
a
fairly
active
member
of
communist
party,
apparently
on
page
158,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
los
angeles.
justice
potter
stewart
los
angeles.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i
understand
how
broad
your
argument
is
in
this
--
on
this
aspect
of
the
case.
now,
let's
assume
as
it
seems
to
be
the
fact
that
this
petitioner,
when
it
was
opposed
and
aggressively
articulately
opposed
to
the
house
un-american
activities
committee
and
wholeheartedly
in
favor
of
its
abolition
and
actively,
in
favor
of
this
commission.
how
much
--
how
much
immunity
then
does
he
get
from
interrogation
by
the
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
is
--
isn't
the
law
--
the
subtle
stated
law
kind
of
against
it
too,
if
you
--
couldn't
congress
require
the
disclosure
of
paid
lobbyist
for
example?
