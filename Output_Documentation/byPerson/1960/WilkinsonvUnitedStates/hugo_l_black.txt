pardon
me
mr.
watts.
mr.
watts,
pardon
me
but
i
didn't
get
the
pages
of
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
--
i
must
have
misunderstood
you.
you
are
referring
to
the
record
page
156,
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
that.
but
then
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you
said
that
--
read
the
part
where
they
said,
he'd
only
been
summoned
as
he
got
to
atlanta.
and
you
said
the
subpoena
was
dated
the
day
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
on
the
subpoena,
as
i
find
it
on
page
236,
it
was
dated
eight
days
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
absolutely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
gave
the
committee
any
additional
information
on
which
to
legislate,
the
fact
that
he
testified
to
the
same
thing
in
different
geographical
sections
of
the
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
--
now,
what
i
was
asking
was
if
the
--
i
understood
the
argument
indeed
that
the
purpose
was
to
inform
congress
so
it
could
translate
the
sections.
did
it
add
anything
to
that
information,
this
rather
the
same
thing
at
seven
or
eight
places
throughout
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
omnibus?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
said
this,
"included
in
that
pervasive
authority
is
the
power
to
investigate
activity
directed
to
interference
with
the
legislative
processes
and
their
functions.”
do
you
think
it's
an
effort
to
get
the
legislation
passed
or
defeated
as
an
interference
for
the
legislative
function?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
could
it
be
that
it
sets
an
effort
to
sway
them
one
way
or
the
other,
even
passed
to
defeat
the
legislation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
to
be
made
unlawful
to
attempt
to
--
if
members
of
the
--
persuade
the
members
of
congress
to
pass
or
defeat
an
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
should
think
–
if
you
–
you
don't
--
i
totally
understand
you
except
the
court's
statement
here
that
there's
a
directed
effort,
directed
interference
that
we
had
here
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
you
try
to
get
that
bill
passed
or
defeated.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
was,
what
differences
does
it
make
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
he
has
right
to
send
this
concern.
i'm
not
talking
about
now
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
something
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
his
right
to
send
it.
then
what
difference
does
that
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
that's
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think,
do
you
that
they
could?
suppose
a
man
had
sent
telegram
of
--
telegrams
or
letters
to
all
persons,
the
members
of
congress,
to
get
them
to
pass
or
defeat
a
bill.
that
he
could
be
punished
by
exposure
or
any
other
methods
by
the
government
for
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
don't
consider
as
in
this
case,
either
one
of
those
points.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
another
question
and
about
the
--
what
the
chief
justice
read
to
you.
who
was
it
that
made
that
statement
that
we
have
information
that
you
are
a
hardcore
communist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
he
a
congressman?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
this
court
ever
held
anymore
with
reference
to
the
power
of
investigation
that
it
gives
congress
the
power
to
ask
questions
in
matters
connected
with
the
legislature?
or
is
there
any
privilege
granted
in
the
constitution
or
elsewhere
or
questions
asked
by
a
nonmember
of
congress
--
for
the
statements
made
by
nonmember
of
congress
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
where
it
charges
a
man
with
something
that's
pretty
serious?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
you
--
i
understand
that
he
was
first
charged
with
being
a
hard-core
communist
whatever
that
is.
but
we
have
held
that
it's
so
serious,
and
has
been
recognized
it's
so
serious,
that
a
man
can
claim
the
privilege
not
to
answer
that.
and
do
you
think
any
of
the
cases
have
held
that
if
a
man
is
charged,
for
instance,
with
a
crime
by
a
counsel
for
committee,
he
can
then
be
compelled
to
answer
that
attorney's
questions.
have
we
ever
had
that
up
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
the
question
i
heard
read
was
that
he
stated
to
him
that
you
are
a
hardcore
communist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
said,
"we
--
we
have
their
message
you're
a
murderer
and
a
thief."
would
that
have
been
a
privilege?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
he
--
suppose
he
just
didn't
want
to
be
accused
for
being
a
thief
or
a
murderer
by
a
counsel
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
committee
isn't
highest
legislature
by
the
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i'm
talking
about
this.
here,
you
have
the
counsel
for
the
committee
accusing
a
man
or
something
which
i
assume
he
thought
and
has
generally
recognized
as
a
pretty
bad
charge,
being
a
hardcore
communist,
whatever
that
is.
have
we
ever
had
any
question
of
the
rights
to
make
those
kinds
of
statements
to
a
man
by
an
attorney
for
a
committee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
would
it,
what
its
purpose
was?
i
assume
that
on
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
if
they
--
you
get
that
--
just
put
it
on
that
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
immaterial.
