chief

did
he
give
any
about
wilkinson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
about
this
other
witness,
mr.
maroney,
who
has
taken
all
over
the
country
to
repeat
and
repeat
and
repeat
again
the
same
testimony
that
he
gave.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
fist
time
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
the
fist
time
he
had
testified
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say,
you
assume
that,
you
don't
know
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
let's
don't
assume
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
maroney,
when
the
chairman
of
the
committee
or
the
counsel
for
the
committee,
when
the
witness
is
on
the
stand,
says,
â€œnow,
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
you
were
a
hardcore
communist
and
that
you
are
engaged
in
communist
propaganda
and
so
forth,"
and
then
ends
it
up
by
saying,
"are
you
a
communist?"
you
don't
think
that
punishes
in
many
regardless
of
how
he
answers
the
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
isn't
putting
him
in
jail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
isn't
putting
him
in
jail,
everybody
knows
that.
but
--
but
to
make
that
statement
without
any
evidence
being
in
the
record,
that
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
is
a
communist,
that
he
is
engaged
in
communist
propaganda,
when
being
a
communist
under
the
--
under
the
legislation
existing
is
a
criminal
offense.
do
you
not
think
that
when
they
then
asked
him,
"are
you
a
communist?"
that
that
is
done
with
the
intention
of
the
effect
of
it,
let's
say,
the
effect
of
it
is
to
punish
him
regardless
of
what
he
says.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
watts.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
welcome.
