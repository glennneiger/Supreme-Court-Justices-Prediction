mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
getting
into
the
particular
facts
of
the
wilkinson
testimony,
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
refer
to
the
testimony
of
mr.
penha
at
these
hearings.
now,
mr.
penha
had
previously
testified
before
the
committee
in
boston
and
i
have
a
recollection
of
reading
in
this
record,
although
i
was
unable
to
find
it
during
luncheon
recess,
an
explanation
that
during
the
boston
hearings,
mr.
penha
made
reference
to
this
communist
party
colonization
program
in
the
south.
he
referred
to
that
and
told
the
committee
about
that
during
the
boston
hearings
but
he
did
not
go
into
detail
in
the
boston
hearings.
the
committee
was
investigating
activities
in
that
area,
not
in
the
south,
at
the
occasion
of
the
boston
testimony.
now,
mr.
penha,
in
these
hearings,
testified
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
national
textile
commission
of
the
communist
party.
during
the
time
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
and
at
the
same
time
reporting
to
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
on
the
activities
of
the
party.
he
testified
that
he
had
been
sent
as
a
member
of
the
national
textile
commission
into
the
south
and
that
he
had
been
instructed
to
and
did
contact
various
communist
party
members
in
this
area
and
with
respect
to
the
colonization
program.
many
of
the
people
who
work
all
these
witnesses
in
these
hearings
were
people
who,
mr.
penha
stated,
were
communist
party
members
whom
he
contacted
on
the
occasion
of
this
trip
through
the
south
on
behalf
of
the
national
textile
commission.
he
testified
further
as
to
what
a
colonizer
was.
that
a
colonizer
was
--
this
is
on
page
9
of
our
brief.
a
colonizer
is
one
that
is
directed
by
the
communist
party
to
teach
and
spread
propaganda
in
order
to
cultivate
the
mass
workers
within
a
plan
or
industry,
and
son
on
and
so
forth.
he
also
testified
and
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
quote
on
that
page
that
the
clear
cut
danger
of
a
colonizer
is
that
he
is
a
part
of
the
vast
network
of
secret
party
members
of
potential
saboteurs,
an
espionage
agents.
the
placement
of
these
colonizers
is
a
key
in
basic
industries
is
vital
to
the
party
from
the
standpoint
of
placing
such
colonizers
in
the
position
of
promoting
strikes,
slowdowns,
and
so
forth.
and
he
gave
further
details
as
to
his
communications
with
these
people
in
the
south
to
test
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
--
he
did
not
testify
concerning
braden
or
wilkinson.
the
testimony
of
these
other
people,
although
most
of
them
refused
to
testify,
i
think
that
is
up
in
the
testimony
to
confirm
the
information
supplied
by
mr.
penha
as
to
the
party's
colonization
program.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
fishman
testified
as
to
the
receipt
into
the
united
states,
the
importation
into
the
united
states,
through
the
mails
of
foreign
communist
propaganda
directed
to
the
areas,
the
geographic
areas,
of
the
south,
so
that
his
testimony
had
to
do
with
the
extent
and
the
general
nature
of
foreign
communist
party
propaganda
that
had
been
imported
into
the
united
states
and
was
destined
to
the
southern
--
various
southern
communities,
as
part
of
an
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
as
part
of
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
far
as
the
south
is
concerned
--
i
assume
that
in
his
other
appearances
which
i
understand
he
made
before
this
committee
in
various
parts
of
the
country
from
newspaper
reports
that
he
testified
as
to
the
direction
of
this
foreign
communist
propaganda
into
a
different
geographical
areas
of
the
country.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
know
that.
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
only
assume
with
the
fact
that
his
testimony
here
related
to
the
importation
of
materials
into
the
south,
and
of
course,
that
was
the
subject
matter,
the
geographical
area
to
which
this
committee
hearing
was
limited.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
far
as
mr.
fishman's
testimony
is
concerned,
i
don't
know
that
--
they
may
not
have
had
sufficient
information
or
have
been
able
to
get
sufficient
information
other
than
at
these
hearings
in
order
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
don't
know
that
it
is
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
i
say,
i
don't
know
that
it's
the
same
testimony.
he
--
he
testified
here
that
he
brought
along
with
him
some
examples
of
foreign
communist
party
propaganda
which
had
come
into
the
united
states
from
abroad,
and
which
was
directed
to
be
disseminated
through
the
mails
into
the
south,
which
was
a
geographic
interest
of
the
committee
in
these
hearings.
now,
whether
he
testified
to
that
in
previous
occasion,
i
couldn't
say.
he
has,
i
understand
as
i
say
from
newspaper
articles,
testified
concerning
the
importation
of
foreign
communist
propaganda
into
the
united
states
generally
in
hearings
before
the
committee.
as
far
as
into
this
particular
area,
i
couldn't
say.
what
--
now,
to
get
to
the
--
to
the
facts
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
petitioner
here,
i
might
point
out,
at
the
outset,
that
this
court,
in
its
opinion
in
the
watkins
case,
pointed
out
at
the
very
beginning
of
that
opinion
that
the
watkins
case
did
not
concern
a
truculent
or
a
condemnations
witness
who
had
refused
to
answer
all
questions
of
the
committee.
this,
however,
is
such
a
case.
this
witness
appeared
before
the
subcommittee.
he
testified
that
he
had
come
in
response
to
a
subpoena,
he
gave
his
name,
and
then
when
he
was
asked
for
his
residence
address,
he
stated
as
a
matter
of
conscience
and
personal
responsibility,
i
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
of
this
committee.
he
was
then
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel
if
he
would
like
counsel
there
and
he
said,
“he
did
not
choose
to
have
counsel”.
the
next
question
he
was
asked,
and
this
is
at
page
155
of
the
record,
2681
of
the
committee
print.
the
question
was,
“mr.
wilkinson,
are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
his
reply
was,
“as
a
matter
of
conscience
and
personal
responsibility,
i
refuse
to
answer
any
questions
of
this
committee.”
it
is
–
it
is
a
refusal
to
answer
that
question
and
that
question
only
that
the
indictment
here
was
based.
now,
after
he
had
refused,
the
staff
director
explained,
went
through
an
elaborate
explanation
consisting
of
about
one
and
a
half
pages
of
the
record,
explaining
to
him
the
twofold
responsibility
of
the
committee
and
the
purpose
why
the
committee
was
conducting
these
hearings.
and
on
the
next
page
of
the
record,
at
156,
is
the
text
of
the
staff
director's
explanation
of
the
committee's
interest
in
informing
itself
of
communist
party
activities
in
this
particular
area
with
a
view
to
enabling
the
committee
intelligently
to
make
recommendations
on
pending
legislature.
there
was
a
particular
reference
in
mr.
arens'
explanation
to
h.r.
9937,
which
was
an
omnibus
bill
which
had
been
introduced
in
the
congress
by
the
chairman
of
the
full
committee
mr.
willis.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it's
--
it
was
a
bill
generally
covering
of
a
number
of
internal
security
statutes
but
it
covers
a
variety
of
different
statutes
and
amendments
to
statutes,
for
example,
it
would
amend
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
it
would
also
have
amended
the
smith
act
to
define
the
word
“organized”
as
used
in
the
act.
i
think
it
covered
some
for
the
passport
procedures.
it
would
have
amended
some
of
the
espionage
statutes.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
bill
covering
a
variety
of
internal
security
statutes.
now,
he
also
explained
that
it
was
the
committee's
information
that
he
was
a
hardcore
member
of
the
communist
party
and
then
he
was
designated
by
the
communist
party
for
the
purpose
of
creating
and
manipulating
certain
organizations
including
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee,
and
then
he
had
been
sent
into
the
south
for
communist
purposes.
and
he
then
stated
that
it
was
the
information
of
the
committee
that
in
anticipation
of
the
hearings
here
in
atlanta,
you
were
sent
to
this
area
by
the
party,
i'm
paraphrasing
trying
to
shorten
the
quotation.
this
is
at
page
156
of
the
record.
"in
anticipation
in
hearings
here
in
atlanta,
you
were
sent
to
this
area
by
the
party
for
the
purpose
of
developing
a
hostile
sentiment
to
this
committee
and
to
its
work
for
the
purpose
of
undertaking
to
bring
pressure
upon
the
congress
to
preclude
these
particular
hearings."
and
then
mr.
arens
said,
"indeed
it
was
a
fact
you
were
not
even
subpoenaed
for
these
particular
hearings
until
we
learned
that
you
were
in
town."
that
apparently
was
an
inadvertency,
it
should
have
been
that
you
were
coming
to
town,
because
he
was
subpoenaed,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
about
a
week
prior
to
his
appearance
before
the
committee
and
almost
a
week
prior
to
his
checking
in
at
the
atlanta
hotel.
the
committee
chairman
then,
in
further
explanation
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions,
said
that
before
he
was
--
he
would
direct
the
witness
to
answer
that
he
would
also
like
to
make
a
further
explanation
of
pertinency.
and
this
is
at
page
157
of
the
record.
and
the
committee
chairman,
mr.
willis
said
that,
"we
have
held
hearings."
he
was
referring
to
a
pending
bill.
"we
have
held
hearings
on
it
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
on
the
question
of
the
organizational
features
of
the
communist
conspiracy."
specifically,
the
supreme
court,
in
what
it
popularly
referred
to
as
the
yates
case,
held
that
the
communist
party
must
be
regarded
as
having
been
organized
in
1945,
and
automatically
all
prosecutions
for
organizational
features
have
been
destroyed
and
no
more
prosecution
is
possible.
he
then
states
that
the
committee
was
therefore
interested
for
--
that
among
other
reasons
for
pertinency
of
these
hearings,
would
be
the
development
of
information
which
we
feel
you
have,
sir,
that
you
could
shed
a
light
on
the
current
methods
of
organizing,
or
regrouping,
or
reconstructing
of
the
party
and
subdivisions
thereof.
so
that
mr.
willis
made
it
clear
to
him
that
in
connection
with
that
legislation
that
would
have
defined
or
would
define,
if
it's
ever
passed,
would
define
the
meaning
of
the
word
“organized”
as
used
in
the
smith
act,
which
was
the
part
of
the
subject
of
this
court's
opinion
in
the
yates
case.
and
he's
asking
the
witness
to
testify
as
to
what
he
can
tell
them
about
the
current
organizational
methods
of
the
communist
party.
now,
mr.
wilkinson
again
refused.
the
chairman
directed
that
he
answer
the
question
and
he
refused
on
the
same
basis.
the
committee
also
pointed
out
to
him
and
this
appears
at
page
158,
and
mr.
arens,
the
staff
director,
read
from
a
committee
transcript
of
hearings
that
it
had
earlier
held
in
california.
i
think.
from
the
testimony
of
a
witness,
anita
schneider,
who
testified
and
identified
mr.
wilkinson
as
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
is
having
had
an
influence
in
a
front
organization
in
that
area.
the
name
with
which
she
--
i
think
–
it
was
the
citizens
committee
to
preserve
american
freedoms.
and
despite
that
information,
mr.
wilkinson
persisted
in
his
refusal,
completely
adamant
refusal
to
cooperate
at
all
or
to
answer
any
questions
of
the
committee.
he
was
later
on
asked
to
identify
a
photo
static
copy
of
his
registration
at
the
hotel
in
atlanta
which
showed
that
he
listed
his
business
firm
as
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee.
oh,
no.
oh
yes,
he
refused
to
answer
that
and
to
identify
the
document
and
he
refused
to
identify
whether
or
not
he
had
made
certain
telephone
calls
from
the
hotel,
which
were
reflected
in
a
list
of
hotel
phone
calls
that
were
received
by
subpoena
from
the
hotel.
and
he
was
also
asked,
"are
you
now
the
principle
driving
force,
the
leader,
of
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee?"
and
he
refused
to
answer
that
question.
now,
for
the
first
question,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
party?”
and
these
two
latter
questions,
he
was
cited
by
the
congress
--
he
was
indicted
on
the
first
question
only.
now,
we
think
on
these
facts,
of
course,
no
fifth
amendment
problem
here.
that
this
case
is
clearly
governed
by
this
court's
decisions
in
the
watkins
case
and
in
the
barenblatt
case.
the
question
here
was
a
direct
question
as
to
the
witnesses'
present
membership
in
the
communist
party.
the
--
the
evidence
we
think
is
overwhelming
that
the
purpose
for
this
witnesses
being
called
before
the
subcommittee
was
not
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
engaged
in
activities
aimed
at
abolishing
the
committee,
but
rather
the
statement
of
the
staff
director
that
he
had
been
subpoenaed
when
they
learned
that
he
had
come
into
the
south
on
behalf
of
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee
to
conduct
or
to
hinder
the
conduct
of
these
hearings,
that
that
was
an
explanation
of
the
occasion
for
his
being
subpoenaed.
the
--
the
committee
chairman
in
the
opening
statement
at
these
hearings
had
made
a
statement
that
the
committee
had
learned
that
the
communist
party
had
been
controlling
its
activities
in
the
south
through
the
importation
from
other
areas,
from
northern
areas
particularly,
the
importation
of
northern
communist
agents
into
the
south
to
control
the
communist
activities
in
the
south.
here,
the
committee
had
information
that
mr.
wilkinson
who
it
had
reason
to
believe
was
a
communist,
had
been
sent
into
the
south
on
communist
business.
we
think
that
clearly,
the
committee
had
a
right
to
subpoena
him,
to
ask
him
the
question
as
to
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
party,
and
to
solicit
information
from
him
as
to
what
he
could
tell
the
committee
of
current
organizational
activities
of
the
party
and
the
propaganda
activities
of
the
communist
party.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision,
stated
that
"in
its
view,
the
case
was
covered
by
the
barenblatt
decision
and
that
it
--
that
included
him
the
pervasive
authority,"
and
this
is
at
page
69
of
the
record.
"included
in
the
pervasive
authority
of
this
committee
is
the
power
to
investigate
activities
directed
to
interference
with
the
legislative
processes
and
their
function."
the
court
then
concluded
that
since
this
was
an
area
in
which
congress
could
legislate,
citing
the
harris
case
that
the
committee
had
a
proper
legislative
purpose
and
that
the
inquiry
was
authorized
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
within
the
committee
resolution.
the
trial
court,
in
his
instructions
to
the
jury,
had
pointed
out
to
the
jury,
and
this
appears
at
page
59
of
the
record
that
--
the
court
said
this.
"now,
in
this
case,
the
government
contends
that
the
subject
matter
under
inquiry,"
it's
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
"was
the
extent,
character,
and
object
of
communist
colonization
and
infiltration
in
the
textile
and
other
basic
industries
located
in
the
south,
communist
party
propaganda
activity
in
the
south,
and
the
entry
or
dissemination
within
the
united
states
of
foreign
communist
party
propaganda."
if
you
find,
beyond
the
unreasonable
doubt,
that
the
subject
matter
under
inquiry
by
the
subcommittee,
at
the
time
the
defendant
appeared
before
it,
was,
as
the
government
contends,
and
that
the
question
that
he
refused
to
answer,
i'm
paraphrasing
now,
"related
to
that
subject
matter
with
undisputed
clarity
and
that
he
was
apprised
of
the
pertinency
in
such
a
way
as
a
reasonable
person
would've
understood
the
pertinency,
then
that
would
satisfy
the
willfulness
requirement
of
his
refusal."
the
petitioner
in
his
--
in
his
brief
raises
the
question,
the
issue
that
the
question
was
not
pertinent
to
the
subject
under
inquiry,
of
course,
at
the
hearing.
the
witness,
the
petitioner,
made
no
objection
to
the
questions
on
the
--
on
the
basis
that
they
were
not
pertinent
to
the
subject
matter
under
inquiry.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
committee,
at
the
conclusion
of
his
testimony,
had
to
practically
dry
out
of
the
witness
the
fact
that
he
was
relying
on
the
first
amendment,
because
his
earlier
assertions
of
refusal
were
simply,
that
on
the
grounds
of
personal
conscience
and
personal
responsibility,
"i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
of
this
committee."
he
--
he
took
a
flat
position
right
from
the
beginning.
it
made
no
legal
objection
to
the
--
to
the
questions.
but
regardless
of
whether
or
not
he
raised
pertinency,
and
therefore,
we
can
raise
it
here,
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear
on
this
record
that
this
question,
in
the
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
barenblatt
case,
was
clearly
pertinent
to
the
three
subjects,
which
we
think
the
record
demonstrates
were
the
subjects
of
the
inquiry
when
this
witness
appeared
before
the
committee.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
contention
raised
on
appeal
which
is
the
same
contention
raised
here.
and
that
is
--
their
contention
taking
the
statement
of
mr.
arens
out
of
context,
we
think.
in
saying
that
the
only
reason
he
was
--
he
was
brought
before
the
subcommittee
was
be
--
was
in
an
effort
to
harass
him.
and
--
and
there
reliance
on
that
statement
that
he
would
--
he
was
not
subpoenaed
until
they
learned
that
he
was
coming
to
atlanta
to
--
in
an
effort
to
hinder
these
--
the
conduct
of
these
hearings.
and
i
think
the
court
was
treating
of
that
argument
in
its
decision.
certainly,
we
think
that
the
court's
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
decision
is
completely
correct
if
the
--
that
the
congress,
that
this
committee,
does
have
a
right
to
investigate
activities
carried
or
propaganda
activities
carried
on
by
the
communist
party
with
a
view
to
exercising
pressures
on
the
legislature.
in
the
same
way
that
i
think
that
congress
can
legislate
as
it
did
on
the
lobbying
statute
which
statute
which
was
involved
in
the
harris
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
won't
say
that
their
limiting
into
that
your
honor.
they
--
that's
the
only
specific
subject.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
that
will
--
they
don't
discuss
that
--
they
recite
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
then
they
say
that
since
the
case
was
tried
--
the
barenblatt
case
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
this
case
is
governed
by
barenblatt
unless
there
are
some
features
distinguishing
it
from
barenblatt.
the
--
the
court
then
stated,
then
they
compare
the
petitioner's
activity
immediately
prior
--
or
his
activity
as
to
admitting
that
he
was
engaged
in
aggressive
opposition
to
the
continued
functioning
of
the
committee.
they
compare
that
with
the
information
as
to
barenblatt
concerning
infiltration
into
--
communist
infiltration
into
education,
and
they
say
that,
"this
activity
of
communist
pressure
aimed
at
the
legislature
is
even
more
dangerous
than
the
type
of
activity
in
the
field
of
education
that
was
involved
in
barenblatt."
this
was
a
subject
matter
in
which
congress
could
legislate
and
therefore
it's
a
proper
subject
for
inquiry.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
an
interference?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
necessarily.
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
it
could
be
depending
on
what
the
fact
situation
was.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
--
but
of
course
i
don't
think
that's
the
measure
of
weather
or
not
congress
has
a
right
to
inquire
in
a
particular
field.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
congress
certainly
could
legislate
and
regulate
such
activities
as
it
did
in
the
lobbying
act.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
what
the
court
was
referring
to
was
the
apparent
efforts
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
acting
on
behalf
of
the
communist
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no
difference
on
his
right
to
send
it.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
on
his
right
to
send
it.
but
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
has
a
right
to
remain
anonymous.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
--
i
think
that
makes
a
difference
and
it's
something
that
congress
has
a
right
to
inform
itself
about
and
to
decide
whether
or
not
legislation
is
needed.
it
might
just
convince
them
that
no
legislation
is
needed,
but
of
course,
an
inquiry
result
with
--
having
such
a
result
is
a
perfectly
proper
inquiry.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
no.
not
punish
this,
because
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
indication
at
any
place
except
in
the
arguments,
conjured
up
by
the
petitioners
in
these
two
cases
that
there's
any
desire
or
intimation
here
of
any
kind
that
the
committee
was
trying
to
punish
activities
or
just
to
exposing
for
the
sake
of
exposure.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
do
not.
no,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
certainly
don't
think
it's
punishment
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
concerning
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
may
result
in
a
detriment,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
committee
certainly
--
certainly
we
couldn't
say
on
this
record
that
the
purpose
of
the
committee
was
to
bring
about
a
detriment.
here,
the
committee
did
have
and
read
to
the
witness
sworn
testimony
that
it
had
received,
i
think
in
california
hearings,
identifying
that
witness
as
a
communist.
the
committee
did
have
information
that
he
had
recently
been
sent
into
the
south
on
communist
party
instructions
for
a
communist
party
business.
the
committee
was
asking
him,
and
i
think
had
a
perfect
right
to
ask
him,
"what
can
you
tell
us
that
will
help
us
know
what
the
communist
party
is
doing?
how
it
is
operating,
how
it
is
organizing,
what
regrouping
is
it
doing?"
so
that
the
committee
could
make
an
intelligent
appraisal,
a
more
intelligent
appraisal,
in
making
recommendations
on
pending
proposals
that
were
in
congress
at
that
time.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it's
the
same
immunity
sanction
that
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
no.
this
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
it's
the
--
it's
part
of
the
immunity
statute
which
was
involved
in
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
no,
no.
the
--
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
the
case
that
was
here
about
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
four
or
five
years
ago,
ullmann.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
at
the
same
time,
as
the
congress
passed
the
statue,
giving
to
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
go
and
request
immunity
from
a
court.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
as
a
part
of
the
same
statute,
committees
of
congress
were
given
authority
to
make
the
same
request
to
the
court
with
the
proviso
that
they
have
to
give
notice.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
hearing
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
can't
cite
a
case
but
there
has
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
has
been
--
i'm
fairly
sure
and
i
would
have
to
check
on
this
and
submit
a
memorandum
for
this.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
certainly.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
what
the
way
it
works
is
the
same
way
it
works
where
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
if
he
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
committee
decides
it
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
is.
yes,
sir.
and
then
he
has
to
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
only
if
he
invokes
the
fifth
amendment
same
as
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
in
the
criminal
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
only
if
the
committee
decides
to
give
it
and
of
course
where
the
committee
is
concerned,
the
attorney
general
must
be
given
notice
so
that
he
can
interpose
an
objection
or
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
but
in
these
hearings,
and
i
don't
think
i
can
make
a
direct
reference
to
it
now
but
we
will
in
the
supplement
--
in
a
supplemental
memorandum
in
connection
with
the
citation
of
the
statute.
one
of
these
witnesses
apparently
gave
the
impression
that
he
might
like
to
furnish
information
and
the
committee
member
made
reference
to
the
authority
of
the
committee
to
request
the
grant
of
immunity
and
they
asked
the
--
they
asked
the
witness,
not
this
witness,
but
another
witness
at
these
hearings.
"if
this
committee
should
decide
to
request
the
grant
of
immunity,
would
you
then
be
willing
to
cooperate
and
to
furnish
information?"
and
he
said
he
would.
but
the
illustration
that
the
committee
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
can
and
sometimes
does
consider
furnishing
or
requesting
immunity,
an
immunity
order
from
a
court,
is
demonstrated
in
these
very
hearings.
and
the
particular
witness
in
the
citation
to
the
record
reference,
we
will
furnish
in
a
supplemental
memorandum,
setting
out
the
statute
under
which
they
could
do
that.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
was
mr.
arens,
staff
director
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
he
was
the
staff
director.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
of
course
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
of
course,
the
witness
here
directed,
after
what
had
transpired
between
the
questionnaire
and
the
witness
--
directed
that
the
witness
answer
the
question.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
that
question
in
that
form
it
has
been
presented
to
the
court.
no,
sir,
but
of
course
here,
the
question
--
he
wasn't
identified
by
mr.
arens
as
being
a
communist
at
the
outset.
he
was
asked
the
question
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
“are
you
a
member
of
the
party?”
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
i
think
--
certainly,
i
think
he
could've
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
and
that
he
could
have
done
it
here.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
you
mean
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
could
congress
be
precluded
from
making
such
an
inquiry?
well,
i
don't
think
congress
could
be
precluded
from
making
an
inquiry
merely
because
the
inquiry
might
reveal
the
commission
of
a
crime
on
the
part
of
the
witness.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
don't
think
that
question
has
ever
been
posed
in
that
way,
your
honor.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
that
under
this
court's
decisions
in
watkins
and
barenblatt,
that
it's
the
type
of
thing
that
has
to
be
explained
to
a
witness
to
demonstrate
to
him
the
pertinency
of
the
question,
why
they
are
asking
him
this
particular
question
in
relation
to
the
overall
inquiry
of
the
committee.
he
was
--
he
wasn't
charged.
the
--
the
committee
made
no
statements
about
mr.
wilkinson
at
the
outset
until
he
decided
that
he
was
not
going
to
answer
anything.
he
didn't
invoke
the
fifth
amendment.
he
--
he
didn't
make
any
legal
explanation.
he
said,
"i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
of
this
committee”
when
he
was
asked
the
question
in
the
first
instance,
“are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?”
when
he
refused,
when
he
gave
no
legal
justification
for
his
refusal,
the
committee
then
explained
that
the
basis
to
demonstrate
to
him
why
they
had
reason
to
ask
him
about
these
things
and
why
the
question
asked
to
him
was
pertinent
to
what
they
were
trying
to
find
out
for
their
own
legislative
purposes.
i
--
i
don't
see
how
they
could
do
it
any
other
way.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
the
fact
that
it
might
result
in
detriment,
i
don't
think
this
detracts
from
the
power
of
the
committee.
the
committee's
purpose
was
not
to
hurt
him.
the
committee's
purpose
was
to
secure
information.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right,
i
think
motive
was
about
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
the
fact
that
there
might
be
result
in
detriment,
i
think
is
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
immaterial
but
i
think
it's
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
has
considered
in
barenblatt,
for
example,
in
weighing
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
individual
against
the
public
right
and
need
for
the
information
that
the
committee
was
seeking.
i
think
that
possibly,
in
weighing
those
opposing
values
that
that
kind
of
a
consideration
might
come
into
play.
but
in
summary,
we
see
nothing
here
at
all
to
take
this
case
out
of
the
barenblatt
decision
and
i
think
it's
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it's
squarely
within
this
court's
decision
in
both
barenblatt
and
in
the
watkins
case.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
barenblatt?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
in
watkins?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
precise
--
i
think
it's
as
to
somebody
else's
membership
your
honor.
i
may
--
i
may
recall
the
precise
questions
of
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
--
he
testified,
i
think,
that
he
was
not
a
communist
and
they
asked
him,
as
to
other
people,
whether
or
not
he
knew
they
were
communists,
and
his
position
was
that
he
didn't
mind
testifying
about
himself
and
his
own
activities
but
he
wouldn't
identify
any
people
that
he
knew
were
communist
unless
he
knew
to
a
certainty
that
they
were
still
communist
as
of
the
time
of
his
testimony.
so
that
the
question
is
related
to
third
parties,
generally
speaking.
thank
you.
