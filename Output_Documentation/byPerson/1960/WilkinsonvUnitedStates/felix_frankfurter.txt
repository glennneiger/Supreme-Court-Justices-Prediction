justice

frankfurter
i
have
an
impression
but
i
don't
know,
though
i
should
know.
there
is
no
immunity
power
for
witnesses
before
the
un-american
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
old
860.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
evident
can't
be
used
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
full
community
--
full
immunity,
there
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
counselman
and
hitchcok.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
that
isn't
an
immunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ullmann.
justice
felix
frankfurter
ullmann.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
was
this
immunity
power
given
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
cases
in
which
witnesses
have
claimed
the
fifth
--
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment,
claims
which
the
committee
need
not
to
stop
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
--
have
there
been
demands
for
--
have
there
been
assertions
of
the
immunity
power
which
you
say
exists
in
hearings
before
the
un-american
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
don't
see
any,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
giving
me
the
reference
of
this
here,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
mean
under
the
statute,
whereby
witness
can
claim
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
when
appearing
before
the
un-american
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
care
how
it
works
but
if
the
statute
is
the
same
as
in
the
ullmann
case
and
the
case
we
had
here
the
other
day,
whatever
it
was,
whereby
they
can
compel
the
testimonies
by
appropriate
procedure
by
getting
a
judge
to
satisfy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there
is
such
a
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
summarizing
why
that's
clear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
this
has
nothing
to
do
what
one
may
think,
one
may
think
as
ill
of
this
conduct
as
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
sometimes
think
ill
of
the
prosecutors
and
the
criminal
courts
and
the
federal
courts
were
asking
cumulative
witnesses.
or
one
may
think,
ill
of
the
judgment
for
allowing
it.
but
why
do
you
--
why
is
there
something
that
lies
in
the
minds
of
men
so
clear
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
an
inquirer
doesn't
have
to
tell
in
advance
what
he's
going
to
get
out
of
a
--
out
of
a
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
man
in
a
criminal
trial
does
that
or
in
a
civil
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
tell
if
he
shut
off
all
inquiry
and
wouldn't
answer
any
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
does
it
appear
in
the
record
that
that's
all
they
wanted
to
get
out
of
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
how
can
you
tell
it
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
know
that
and
i
don't
know
that
and
the
record
doesn't
disclose
it,
because
he
shut
off
all
inquiries.
and
an
examining
counsel
doesn't
have
to
tell
in
advance
what
he's
trying
to
get
out
of
a
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
think
that
was
an
illicit
forbidden
line
of
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
were
those?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
the
letter
is
not
–
that
the
inquiry
whether
it
was
a
communist,
an
organized
communist
effort
to
put
the
committee
out
of
business,
which
i
might
privately
sympathize,
is
--
excludes
an
inquiry
whether
they
were
engaged
in
trying
to
put
him
out
of
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
score
of
remedies,
do
you
think
that's
excluded
as
a
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
you
have
very
strict
notions
of
relevance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
very
different
thing,
statutory
construction.
i
myself
had
a
hand
in
it.
statutory
construction
narrowly
construing
legislation
to
avoid
raising
questions
doesn't
prove
that
it's
constitutionally
forbidden,
a
very
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
watts,
there's
very
little
doubt.
one
doesn't
have
to
be
a
great
profit
to
know
that
there
will
be
full
coming
proposals
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
carry
out
certain
what
some
people
may
think
very
highly
desirable
social
measures
and
what
some
other
people
may
think
destructive
proposals.
and
the
chances
are
very
good
if
it
passes
any
guide
to
the
future.
that
there
would
be
powerful
interest
against
the
passage
of
what
–
referring
to
the
united
states
maybe
a
very
desirable
in
legislation.
and
you
say
that
if
there's
a
mass
effort
to
flood
the
congress
or
to
saturate
congress
with
opposition
to
highly
desirable
legislation
that
is
so
conceived
by
the
person
and
leaders
of
congress,
you
cannot
find
out
the
source
of
that
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you
the
past
is
against
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
future
may
not
be
but
the
past
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
construction,
not
as
a
matter
of
constitutionality.
