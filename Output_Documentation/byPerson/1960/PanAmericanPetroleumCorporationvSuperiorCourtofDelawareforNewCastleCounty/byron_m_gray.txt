mr.
byron
m.
gray
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
petitions
consolidated
here.
i
will
make
the
direct
argument
for
pan
american,
and
mr.
paul
schlicher
will
make
the
direct
argument
for
texaco,
and
i
will
make
the
rebuttal
for
both
petitioners.
these
appeals
involve
the
rate
paid
on
sales
of
natural
gas
made
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
under
the
natural
gas
act.
the
actions
originated
in
a
state
court.
now,
the
natural
gas
act,
as
your
honors
know
is
a
complete
regulatory
act
and
particularly,
is
applied
to
these
actions.
section
4
of
the
act
provides
for
a
complete
rate
filing
with
the
federal
power
commission.
it
provides
that
all
rates
and
charges
must
beyond
the
file
of
that
commission.
section
19
provides
a
very
complete
review,
procedure
and
everything,
and
the
review
jurisdiction
is
placed
in
the
various
united
states
courts
of
appeals.
section
22
provides
for
the
enforcement
of
the
rights
and
duties
and
obligations
created
by
that
act.
so,
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
a
state
court
has
jurisdictions
of
an
action
involving
natural
gas
rates
required
by
the
act
to
be
on
file
with
the
commission.
the
facts
of
the
--
these
actions
have
to
go
back
beyond
january
1,
1954
because
the
contracts
that
are
involved
were
entered
before
that
date
and
for
--
for
less
than
eleven-cents
per
thousand
cubic
feet.
but
on
january
1,
1954,
the
so-called
kansas
eleven-cent
minimum
rate
order
was
entered
by
the
kansas
corporation
commission.
it
became
effective
on
that
date
and
required
that
eleven-cents,
in
order
to
meet
the
conservation
requirements
of
the
kansas
statute
to
prevent
waste
of
gas,
that
eleven-cents
would
be
the
minimum
rate
that
could
be
charged.
now,
the
cities
service,
the
respondent
here,
advised
these
petitioners
that
it
would
comply
with
the
kansas
order
and
pay
the
eleven-cents,
but
it
was
doing
so
under
the
compulsion
of
the
order
and
would
expect
its
--
its
money
refunded
back
to
the
contract
rates
in
the
event
the
kansas
order
were
ultimately
declared
to
be
invalid.
and
for
five
or
six
months
that
was
the
status.
and
then
on
the
sixth
day
and
the
seventh
day
of
june
1954,
this
court
decided
phillips
versus
wisconsin,
wherein
for
the
first
time,
the
industry
and
these
parties
came
aware
of
the
fact
that
producers
of
gas
that
the
wellhead
independent
producers
were
natural
gas
companies
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
and
therefore,
of
course,
it
required
to
file
their
rates
and
take
all
of
the
other
actions
that
the
act
requires
of
natural
gas
companies.
the
federal
power
commission
responded
to
the
wisconsin
case
by
implementing
section
4
of
the
act
setting
forth
the
requirements
for
filing
and
required
that
the
parties
file
the
rate,
in
effect,
on
june
7,
1954
as
their
initial
rate
filing
under
section
4
(c).
now,
section
4
(c)
of
the
act
requires
that
schedules
showing
all
rates
and
charges
be
filed
and
will
file
with
the
federal
power
commission
that
i
stated.
responding
the
order
of
74
--
174
and
in
conformities
to
that
order
and
the
requirement
of
that
order
that
the
rate,
in
effect,
on
june
7,
1954
be
filed
as
initial
rate
of
filing
under
section
4
(c).
these
petitioners
filed
what
the
commission's
order
required
them
to
file,
the
contract,
any
documents
supplementary
of
the
contract
and
one
of
this
is
the
kansas
eleven-cent
order.
and
the
order
174
also
required
that
they
file
a
billing
statement
showing
the
billing
as
it
was
being
made
on
june
7,
1954.
these
parties
filed
the
billing
showing
the
eleven-cent
rate.
thereafter,
now,
i
should
say
that
no
objection
was
made
to
this
rate
tender,
although
the
cities,
people
were
served
at
that
time
with
copies
of
the
tender
as
made
and
were
perfectly
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
was
eleven-cent
tender
and
in
fact
will
paying
the
eleven-cent.
since
then,
and
as
i
will
point
out,
subsequently,
continued
to
pay
it
after
the
commission
had
accepted
it.
after
these
filing,
the
federal
power
commission
admits
and
its
record
show
that
it
considered
the
rate
tender
of
these
petitioners.
i
should
say
that
pan
american
did
not
file
this
refund
letter,
but
they
considered
the
rate
filing.
this
document
file
construed
it
to
be
a
rate
filing
of
eleven-cents,
set
forth
in
their
records
that
they
voted
to
accept
it,
and
the
records
show,
on
page
639
of
this
record,
the
schedule
as
they
set
out,
and
it
says
at
the
top
summary
of
independent
producer
rate
filing
and
these
contracts
over
it
decide
price
june
7,
1954
eleven-cents,
eleven-cents.
thereafter,
immediately
following
that,
the
commission
notified
the
--
then
the
standard
oil
&
gas
company,
now
the
pan
american,
"this
is
to
advise
you
that
the
rate
filings
listed
at
the
bottom
of
this
letter
have
been
accepted
for
filing."
now,
there
you
have
a
complete
compliance
with
the
act
itself,
the
filing
of
the
tender
of
the
rate,
its
acceptance,
and
you
had
no
actions
at
all
by
cities,
no
actions
under
section
19
of
the
act
to
seek
any
review
of
what
the
commission
had
done,
instead
of
that,
they
continued
to
pay
the
eleven-cents
and
did
so
for
more
than
three
years.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
no,
it
was
not.
it
was
--
it
was
the
first
filing.
section
4
(c)
requires
an
original
and
initial
filing.
and
as
i
shall
point
out
later,
it
must
essentially
also
require
what
the
commission
here
did,
a
consideration
of
the
rate
filing
and
its
acceptance
in
filing
with
the
commission.
and
i
shall
discuss
that
later.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
in
respect
of
it
becoming
effective,
i
believe.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
the
pan
american
filing,
and
that's
what
i'm
talking
about
now,
did
not.
it
might
be
argued
that
the
texaco
filing
did
because,
ultimately,
texaco
filed
a
refund
letter,
and
mr.
schlicher
will
discuss
that
phase
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
no.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
it
did
not.
and
there
was
no
objection
on
the
part
of
cites
at
--
whatsoever
with
the
filing
that
pan
american
made,
although
they
were
served
with
copies
of
it,
of
notice.
and
furthermore,
your
honor,
as
i
point
out
whatever
was
the
compulsion
of
the
eleven-cent
payment
during
the
few
months
prior
to
the
filing,
it
may
have
been
under
the
compulsion
of
the
kansas
eleven-cent
order
for
those
four
or
five
months.
but
subsequently,
it
was
under
the
compulsion
of
the
fact
was
the
rate
on
file,
in
the
files
of
the
federal
power
commission,
and
that
month
begin
the
compulsion
thereafter.
and
they
continued
to
pay
eleven-cents
for
three
years
and
more,
as
i
shall
point
out.
but
my
point
at
this
point
is
this,
when
the
commission
accepted
and
placed
eleven-cents
in
its
files
as
the
filed
rate,
that
withhold
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
and
the
natural
gas
act
attached
to
that
rate.
and
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
act
(inaudible)
and
every
right
and
liability,
it
really
wasn't
developed
by
the
act
from
the
moment
of
federal
power
commission
took
that
eleven-cents
and
said,
“this
is
the
rate
in
effect
on
june
7,
1954.”
and
if
anyone
wanted
to
do
anything
about
it,
the
act
provided
the
remedy
in
section
19
of
judicial
review
not
in
the
state
court,
not
even
in
the
federal
district
court
but
in
a
circuit
court
of
appeals,
and
they
took
no
such
action,
and
that's
my
point
there.
well
--
mr.
byron
m.
gray
yes.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
they
could've
done
what
they
did
in
the
magnolia
case.
they
could've
objected
to
the
file.
they
--
they
could
have
said,
“you
--
you
should
include
this
refund
letter.”
they
--
they
could
have
said,
“we
are
contesting
the
validity
of
the
kansas
eleven-cent
order,
and
we
don't
leave
it
or
to
be
accepted
as
a
part
of
this
rate
tender
are
considered
as
evidentiary
of
what
is
the
rate,”
but
they
took
no
action.
they
were
in
default.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
nothing
--
nothing
in
--
mr.
byron
m.
gray
--
nothing
in
the
filing
of
pan
american
to
show
any
condition
whatsoever,
nothing.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
yes.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
the
--
the
statement
showed
eleven-cent
payment.
that's
what
the
statement
is
showing.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
the
contract
offer
seven-cent
rate.
the
kansas
order
which
was
treated
as
supplemental
of
the
contract
ought
from
eleven-cent
rate.
the
billing
statement
showed
eleven-cents
being
paid
on
that
date,
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
order
number
174
required
that
there'd
be
file
as
the
initial
rate
filing,
the
rate,
in
effect,
on
june
7,
1954,
and
this
was
tendered
as
needing
the
requirements
of
that
order.
and
my
point
is
that
if
there's
any
meaning
to
section
19,
then
was
the
time
for
anyone
who
was
claiming
that
the
kansas
order
should
not
be
considered
as
evidentiary
of
the
rate
been
in
effect.
that
was
the
time
for
them
to
raise
their
voice.
now,
you
have
those
cases
arise.
and
i
don't
want
to
get
too
far
into
this,
but
here's
--
if
you
will
remember
quite
recently
in
1960,
you
have
before
you
the
case
of
texas
gas
transmission
company
versus
shell.
and
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
circuit
court,
but
that
was
a
section
19
(b)
case,
and
it
involves
this
very
order,
174
that
required
initial
filing.
but
there
--
there
was
an
escalation
or
what
you
call
a
"favored-nation"
clause,
and
the
question
was
whether
it's
been
triggered
or
not.
and
that
shell
or
the
producer
had
offered
for
filing
a
rate
higher
than
the
contract
seemed
to
call
for
because
it
was
contended
that
the
escalation
clause
had
been
triggered
by
some
other
contract,
and
i'm
sure
you
remember
that
case,
by
some
of
the
contract.
well,
the
commission
didn't
just
accept
what
they
offered.
they
exercised
their
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
accept
what
was
offered,
and
they
didn't
accept
it
because
it
didn't
appear
on
the
face
of
things,
how
the
rate
got
to
be
twelve
point
something
cents
instead
of
nine
point
something
cents.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
yes.
and
it
was
bridged.
it
was
bridged
by
the
tender,
of
what
or
anything,
anyone
then
knew
was
a
perfectly
valid
kansas
eleven-cent
order.
now,
i'm
coming
to
the
invalidation
of
that
order
some
three
years
later.
but
as
far
as
the
commission
goes,
at
that
time,
if
it
had
jurisdiction
to
accept
any
rate
whatsoever,
eleven-cents
or
any
other
rate,
if
it
had
jurisdiction,
it
exercises
it.
and
anyone
who
didn't
like
what
it
did
was
certainly
called
upon
the
act
then
or
section
19
doesn't
mean
anything.
now,
that's
my
point
there.
it
may
--
i've
been
wrong,
but
it
was
honestly
wrong
if
it
was
wrong
and,
of
course,
mistakes
in
law,
as
you
heard
here
in
criminal
law
even
sometimes
work
hardships.
but
if
it
one
mistake
on
anybody
part,
it
was
an
honest
mistake,
but
the
record
and
the
history
of
the
magnolia
case
shows
that
cities
knew
very
well
what
to
do
because
there,
it
did
the
very
thing
and
it
might
have
done
here,
contested
the
rate
tender
when
it
was
made.
but
it
didn't
do
it
here,
and
i
say
that
the
eleven-cent
acceptance
filing
became
final.
but
in
all
events,
on
january
20,
1958,
this
court
held,
in
effect,
that
the
natural
gas
act
so
far
preempted
the
field
of
rates
as
it
applies
to
producers
that
the
wellhead
producing
gas
for
resale
and
the
interstate
commerce
as
to
preempt
the
state
and
take
away
any
power
that
the
state
might
have
had
and
declare
the
kansas
eleven-cent
order
in
that.
now,
cities
will
claim
that
it's
been
held
to
be
invalid
to
have
an
issue.
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
in
to
that
argument,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
real
difference.
but
at
all
the
events,
it
was
declared
invalid.
now,
for
three
years,
these
parties
had
been
paying
eleven-cents
not
by
a
virtue
of
the
kansas
order.
they've
been
paying
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
the
rate
on
--
filed
under
the
4
(c)
of
the
act.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
yes,
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
i
think
you
have
to
consider
this.
it
may
have
been
so
conditioned,
and
mr.
schlicher
will
discuss
this
more
than
i
will,
but
it
may
have
been
so
conditioned.
but,
the
--
the
record
shows
clearly
what
the
commission's
action
was.
it
considered
the
rate
to
be
eleven-cents,
and
that's
the
rate,
the
records
of
the
commission
show
that
it
accepted
and
filed.
so
i
can't
think
that
--
that
that
letter
being
filed
or
not
being
filed
made
any
overwhelming
difference.
it
might
have
influenced
the
commission
to
accept
the
matter
down
for
hearing
on
its
motion,
and
i've
heard
the
parties
argue
about
it
but
it
didn't
--
so
far
as
i
know,
do
that,
although
i
hate
to
discuss
mr.
schlicher's
particular
facts.
but
that's
--
that
would
be
my
view
of
it,
that
the
important
thing
is
they
exercise
their
jurisdiction
to
file
a
rate,
and
they
filed
eleven-cent
rate,
they
did
it
in
both
cases,
and
i
think
that
ends
the
matter
in
my
certain
appeal
under
section
19.
but
in
any
event,
after
the
kansas
order
was
declared
invalid,
cities
brought
these
actions
in
the
trial
court
in
delaware
state
court,
and
they
brought
them
upon
these
refund
--
so
called
--
what
they
called
refund
letters
or
involuntary
payment
letters
that
you
might
choose
to
call
them,
the
common-law
action.
in
their
first
petition,
they
didn't
say
anything
at
all
about
the
gas
being
sold
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
which
is
a
rather
considerable
jurisdictional
fact
that
they're
ommiting.
well,
after
some
parrying
around
and
filing
various
motions
one
thing
and
another,
the
fact
began
to
emerge
that
--
that
this
gas
was
sold
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce.
but
for
whatever
reason,
cities
then
amended
their
complaint
and
it
seems
to
me
this
just
demolishes
their
argument
that
they
will
properly,
in
the
state
court
general
jurisdiction
with
the
common-law
action,
because
i
almost
have
to
raise
this
amendment
that
they
put
in
because
its
jurisdictional
and
supplies
the
jurisdictional
fact.
they
said
in
their
amendment,
“plaintiff
owns
and
operates
an
interstate
gas
pipeline
system.
during
all
times,
material,
herein,
plaintiff
has
been
and
is
now
engaged
generally
in
the
business
of
purchasing
natural
gas
for
transportation
and
sale
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale,”
that's
almost
the
words
of
the
statute,
"for
ultimate
public
consumption
for
domestic,
commercial,
industrial
or
any
other
use
and
furtherance,
whereof,
the
contract
referred
to
in
paragraph
3
about
what's
entered
into."
well,
promptly
after
that,
of
course,
there
was
a
motion
on
the
part
of
defendants
for
summary
judgment
on
the
jurisdictional
question.
i
--
i
don't
want
to
go
now
too
much
into
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
because
it
doesn't
make
too
much
difference
here,
but
it
reasoned
in
--
in
effect
that
it
could
wiped
out
the
kansas
eleven-cent
order
automatically
and
retroactively
and
--
and
reach
back
and
do
for
the
federal
power
commission
what
the
federal
power
commission
didn't
do
for
itself,
and
then
come
out
with
the
rate
that
it
thought
the
federal
power
commission
could
come
out,
and
it
ultimately
reached
a
rather
odd
conclusion
that
there
was
no
inconsistency
in
exercising
state
court
jurisdiction
as
a
--
of
a
common-law
claim
as
long
as
the
rate
involved
would
be
the
same
whether
it
was
a
filed
rate
or
the
rate
under
the
contract.
now,
that
makes
appeal
this
court,
but
it
just
doesn't
appeal
to
me.
but
that
was
in
about
the
reasoning.
the
--
strangely
enough,
after
it
was
apparent,
the
trial
court
was
going
right
ahead
and
entered
judgments
in
these
matters.
of
course,
the
party
didn't
want
these
large
judgments
entered
against
them
one
way
or
another.
and
they
proceeded
these
petitioners
to
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
to
get
a
writ
of
prohibition
to
prevent
the
trial
court
proceeding
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
in
these
cases.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware,
well,
i
didn't
use
the
same
words
as
the
trial
court
got
to
the
same
end
and
in
very
much
the
same
way.
they
said
and
i'm
--
i'll
quote
very
little
from
it,
but
it
will
give
you
the
general
rationale
of
how
the
supreme
court
looked
at
it.
they
said
both
parties
agreed
that
as
to
the
period
after
july
16,
1954,
the
only
legal
rate
is
the
filed
rate,
not
even
a
court
can
authorize
commerce,
and
they
come
out
other
terms
reporting
the
montana-dakota
case
of
this
court.
the
question
then
becomes,
what
rate
was
legally
filed.
then
they
say,
“however,
since
the
kansas
order
was
void,
the
only
lawful
filed
rate
is
the
contract
rate
unaffected
by
the
kansas
order.”
so,
no,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
trial
court,
that
was
the
trial
court
that
said
that.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
held
as
long
as
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
trial
court
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
the
filed
rate
with
the
natural
gas
act
but
it
was
alright
for
them
to
go
ahead
and
exercise
jurisdiction.
and
they,
in
effect,
held
that
the
action
of
the
fpc,
in
accepting
the
eleven-cent
tender
was
a
nullity.
they
said,
“defendants
duly
filed
the
documents
required,”
that
was
required
by
--
by
174,
the
order
of
the
federal
power
commission.
these
documents
included
copies
of
the
contract
with
cities,
copies
of
the
kansas
price
order
and
statement
showing
that
the
price
to
cities
on
june
7,
1954
was
eleven-cents
at
this
specified
pressure.
the
commission
duly
convened
and
voted
to
accept
them
for
filing,
now
this
is
supreme
court
of
delaware.
then
they
say,
“being
void,
the
unilateral
filing
of
the
order
is
part
of
the
rates
schedule
was
a
nullity.”
they
held
that
"informed
at
least"
they
said
and
that's
the
words
of
the
supreme
court
of
delaware.
informed
at
least
the
action
is
based
upon
the
refund
contracts.
now,
despite
of
the
fact
that
they
have
said
that
the
commission
met
and
voted
and
accepted
for
filing
a
eleven-cent
rate
despite
of
the
fact
that
they
recite
all
of
these
matters
that
are
jurisdictional
to
the
federal
power
commission.
they
hold
that
the
natural
gas
act
did
not
prevent
the
state
court
from
exercising
jurisdiction
in
this
action
on
this
refund
contract
(inaudible)
now,
without
to
be
nothing
more
or
less
than
a
collateral
tax
upon
the
action
of
the
commission
and
upon
that
eleven-cent
rate,
it
either
must
be
an
attempt
to
gain
a
review
as
you
would
do
under
section
19
of
the
act
or
it
must
be
treated
as
an
action
to
enforce
to
file
rate
which
would
be
a
section
22
action
or
perhaps
both.
perhaps,
they
try
to
do
in
the
state
court
what
they
would
have
to
have
gone
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
review
actions
to
do
and
then
having
established
what
the
file
rate
is,
if
--
when
pay
it
they
go
into
a
federal
district
court
because
section
22
of
the
act
says
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
actions
to
enforce
any
right,
to
enforce
any
right
created
by
the
act
or
liability
shall
be
in
the
federal
district
courts.
now,
the
subject
matter
of
these
actions
whether
it's
in
the
state
court
or
whether
it's
in
the
federal
court
or
wherever
it
is,
the
subject
matter
and
obviously,
the
price
to
be
paid
for
this
gas
that
was
sold
subject
to
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
power
commission.
that's
got
to
be
the
subject
matter.
and
they're
simply
cannot
be
concurrent
causes
of
action,
one,
based
on
the
contract
and
one,
based
on
the
filed
rate.
now,
in
the
montana-dakota
case
involving
the
power
electric
--
power
statute
that
are
identical
to
these
statutes,
this
court
said
that
the
rate
at
its
own
file
in
the
federal
power
commission
is
the
rate
that's
almost
pay
--
it
--
is
the
only
rate,
anyone
can
pay,
and
that
is
true
whether
it
has
been
fixed
or
merely
accepted
for
filing
by
the
federal
power
commission,
and
that
must
be
the
controlling
law
if
there
is
to
be
any
sense
at
all
to
our
regulatory
statutes.
what
--
through
the
delaware
court
and
what
the
--
through
--
both
delaware
courts
on
and
it's
in
fact,
i
think,
throwing
off
certain
of
our
trial
--
federal
courts
have
decisions
in
such
cases
as
the
mobile
case.
now,
mobile
went
up
under
the
review
statutes,
and
that's
something
you
all
overlooked,
as
all
of
these
cases
that
the
cities
cite
went
up
under
section
19
as
review
statutes.
and
in
mobile,
this
court
said
that
the
act
left
the
parties
free
to
contract
as
to
their
rates,
but
it
didn't
say
and
make
them
effective
outside
the
scope
of
the
federal
power.
now,
i
didn't
say
that,
and
i
can
tell
you
why
it
seems
to
me
they
couldn't
have
said
that.
what
this
court
have
said
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
take
away,
preempt
kansas
state's
rights
to
deal
with
these
rates
and
turn
them
over
to
private
parties
entirely
without
any
standards
to
make
them
effective
contract,
for
them
effective
suing
court
on
them
entirely
outside
the
scope
of
the
federal
power.
that
raises
constitutional
questions,
i
don't
want
to
discuss
here,
and
i'm
not
going
to
discuss,
because
you
can
see
them
as
clearly
as
i
can.
but,
that
is
what
you
would
have
to
say
to
hold
with
cities,
is
that
these
parties
can
enter
into
a
--
contracts,
make
it
effective
without
filing,
sue
on
it
in
the
state
court,
wholly
outside
of
the
act.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
yes?
mr.
byron
m.
gray
yes.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
if
the
--
in
the
--
in
the
great
northern
case,
they
are
adjudicating
what
was
the
filed
rate
under
statutory
actions
to
enforce
the
filed
rate,
and
my
answer
would
be
if
they
were
doing
that
and
it
came
around.
but
the
--
the
state
court
can't
adjudicate
what
is
the
filed
rate
because
section
22
says
exclusive
jurisdiction
there.
exclusive
is
in
the
federal
district
courts.
but
my
answer
is
that
if
it
were
an
action
to
determine
or
enforce
the
filed
rate
and
there
was
no
administrative
finding
require,
then
the
answer
would
be
yes,
but
that
action
would
have
to
be
in
a
federal
district
court.
it
simply
cannot
be
a
loose
jurisdiction
wondering
overall
of
the
state
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
in
this
land
to
upset
what
the
federal
power
commission
has
done.
and
it
wasn't
the
intent
of
congress.
and
i
don't
want
to
impose
on
mr.
schlicher's
time.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
i
think
that
came
up
in
the
state
court,
but
--
mr.
byron
m.
gray
but
the
interstate
commerce
--
mr.
byron
m.
gray
well,
you
have
different
statutes.
as
you
will
recall,
your
honor,
the
interstate
commerce
act
particularly
reserves
state
court
jurisdiction.
whereas,
the
federal
power
act,
they
particularly
and
exclusively
get
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
what?
mr.
byron
m.
gray
to
--
to
enforce
tariff
--
to
enforce
tariff
rates.
mr.
byron
m.
gray
yes.
