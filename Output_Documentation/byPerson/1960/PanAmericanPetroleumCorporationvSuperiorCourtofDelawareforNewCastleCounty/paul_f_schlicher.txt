mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
may
it
please
the
court.
i
first
intended
to
argue
the
point
that
the
theory
--
the
jurisdictional
theory
of
the
delaware
state
courts
that
they
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
courts
actually
usurps
the
exclusive
jurisdiction,
the
exclusive
power
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
under
section
19
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
review
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission,
modify
those
rate
orders
and
set
them
aside.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
correct.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
it
is
the
position
of
texaco
that
they
had
a
remedy
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
--
that
they
had
slept
on
their
rights,
and
you
can't
help
this
people
anywhere.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
in
effect
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
well,
the
natural
gas
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
--
the
natural
gas
act
itself
creates
two
different
kinds
of
court
actions
with
respect
to
natural
gas
rates.
the
first
one
is
section
19.
if
a
rate
is
established,
as
mrs.
--
mr.
gray
has
explained,
and
if
once
accepted
and
filed
by
the
commission
under
your
montana-dakota
decision,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
what
it
then
becomes
the
federal
rate,
the
filed
rate,
the
effective
filed
rate.
now,
if
the
commission
made
an
error,
if
their
action
was
not
void,
then,
of
course,
that
rate
becomes
final
unless
it
is
properly
challenged
and
the
only
way
it
can
be
challenged
is
the
--
the
course
through
section
19
(a)
where
you
petition
the
commission
for
review,
and
if
that's
denied
on
to
section
19
(b)
and
in
the
tacoma
opinion
of
this
court,
city
of
tacoma
against
taxpayers
of
tacoma,
the
--
were
section
313
(b)
of
the
federal
power
act
which
is
in
all
material,
respects
and
wording,
the
--
identical
with
section
19
(b).
there,
this
court
made
plain
that
the
only
way
that
you
could
review
orders
or
the
only
court
that
had
the
power
to
review
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission
was
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
yes,
that
the
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
of
any
rate
matter.
once
a
rate
has
been
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
--
filed
and
accepted.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
the
respondents
are
the
delaware
court
or
the
delaware
courts
which
already
had
--
it
has
that
power.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
no,
they
don't.
cities
is
not.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
because
the
delaware
courts,
the
decision
which
we
are
contesting
actually
did
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
no.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
no
sir,
that
is
not
my
point.
my
point
is
this,
that
in
order
to
retain
jurisdiction,
the
delaware
courts
themselves
had
to
set
aside
or
modify
an
order
of
the
power
commission
--
of
the
federal
power
commission,
and
that
is
why
they
usurp
the
powers
of
the
--
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeal.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
alright,
sir.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
well,
we
certainly
know
this.
we
certainly
know
that
the
delaware
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
to
me,
it
doesn't.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
well,
when
the
--
when
the
supreme
court
of
delaware,
their
basic
mistake
was
when
they
went
on
the
form
of
the
action
and
when
they
said
that
the
form
of
action
determines
whether
or
not
the
state
court
or
the
federal
district
courts
will
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
a
rate
order
under
section
22
of
the
natural
gas
act,
that
was
wrong.
the
whole
interpretation
of
the
act
and
the
only
orderly
interpretation
of
the
act
would
be
that
if
any
action,
no
matter
what
its
form,
whether
it's
a
common-law
or
otherwise,
if
it
has
the
purpose
or
it
has
the
effect
of
enforcing
a
duty
or
liability
created
under
natural
gas
act,
then
automatically,
the
act
takes
over.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
well,
i
--
i
think
that
it's
more
a
question
of
law
to
this
--
to
this
extent
that
once
a
--
a
rate
becomes
a
filed
rate,
an
effective
filed
rate,
then
it,
certainly,
immediately,
creates
certain
liabilities
and
duties
or
the
act
does.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
part
of
it
does,
your
honor,
but
we
are
now
practically
arguing
all
the
time
since
june
7th,
1954
when
the
commission
assume
jurisdiction
over
the
producers'
rights.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
it
became
effective
in
19
--
no,
as
of
june
7th,
1954.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
oh,
no,
no.
i
think
you're
referring
to
cities'
so
called
refund
letter
which
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
--
is
an
entirely
different
point.
i
was
trying
to
finish
answering
this.
i
should
--
i
like
to
go
ahead
with
this
first,
if
i
may.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
well,
i
hope
to
get
to
that
conditional
rate.
i
think
--
i
think
i
can
explain
that
probably
more
quickly
and
should
do
it
first.
the
commission
--
when
texaco
filed
the
so-called
refund
letter
which
is
nothing
more
than
a
unilateral
statement
by
cities
that
it
intended
to
pays
this
kansas
minimum
price
order
of
eleven-cents
involuntarily.
the
commission
accepted
this
letter
for
filing
as
a
part
of
texaco's
rate
schedule.
the
letter
order
of
acceptance
of
the
commission
is
shown
at
page
155
of
the
record,
and
that
letter
orders
says
that
"any
provisions
contained
in
this
document
which
provide
for
automatic
adjustments
and
charges
may
not
operate
to
change
the
rates
being
charge
june
7th,
1954,"
which
was
certainly
the
eleven-cent
rate,
no
one
denies
that,
"until
a
change
in
rate
has
been
filed
pursuant
to
section
4
(d),"
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
mobile
case
says
cannot
be
done.
now,
no
such
notice
has
ever
been
filed
to
effect
that
change
with
respect
to
this
particular
letter.
moreover,
the
commission
added
that
the
acceptance
of
the
cities'
letter
as
supplement
number
4
of
texaco's
rate
schedule
would
not,
and
i
quote,
â€œbe
deemed
as
recognition
of
any
claimed
contractual
right
or
obligation
associated
therewith.
thus,
the
commission
specifically
denied
the
very
contractual
right
which
cities
now
claims
established
the
automatic
change
in
rate.
to
get
back
to
the
section
22
question
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
there
was
a
letter,
they
were
never
requested
to
file
it,
and
they
never
filed
it.
the
commission
asked
us
to
file
it.
after
we
filed
it,
then
they
wrote
this
letter
saying
they
interpret
it
to
have
no
automatic
effect.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
there
was
a
letter
written
to
pan
american
the
same
date,
january
21,
1954
that
--
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
--
was
never
filed.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
it
was
never
filed
with
the
commission
or
accepted
by
it.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
those
facts
in
pan
american.
so
that
when
the
filed
rate
became
the
federal
rate,
it
created
this
duty
on
the
part
of
texaco
to
charge
only
the
filed
rate,
no
more,
no
less.
it
also
became
a
liability
or
texaco
became
liable
if
it
did
undercharge
or
it
did
overcharge
to
immediately
either
make
the
--
collect
the
under
charge
or
refund
the
over
charge.
now
--
so
there
were
liabilities
and
duties
created
by
the
filing
of
the
rate,
and
that
is
why
we
say
that
if
it
has
the
effect,
if
any
action,
whether
it
be
a
count
based
on
common-law
theories
or
no
matter
what
it
is,
if
it
has
its
purpose
or
its
effect
of
enforcing
any
of
these
liabilities
or
duties,
then
automatically,
section
22
takes
over
and
the
jurisdiction
is
in
the
federal
courts.
this
has
to
be,
this
has
to
be
for
this
reason,
that
if
there
are
no
common-law,
there
are
no
excuses,
no
common-law
defenses
to
the
filed
rate,
it
could
well
be
that
a
suit
brought
in
a
federal
district
court
which
must
file
the
rate
to
be
what
the
commission
actually
accepted
and
filed
could
be
in
a
different
letter.
then
the
same
suit
brought
in
a
state
court,
where
a
--
common-law
defenses
are
available
and
whereas
these
delaware
courts
did
found
that
the
rate
should
have
been
the
contract
rate.
they
didn't
even
look
at
what
the
commission
did.
they
ignored
the
action
of
the
commission,
and
it's
the
action
of
the
commission
that
makes
the
filed
rate,
and
that's
the
whole
point.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
correct.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
if
that
applies,
then
you're
going
to
have
two
different
courts,
one,
state
court
and
a
federal
court
by
--
in
different
great
levels.
it
--
it
cannot
be
avoided.
mr.
paul
f.
schlicher
in
these
very
suits,
cities
has
brought
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
on
the
same
sales.
oh,
my
time
is
up,
sir.
