mr.
charles
v.wheeler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
concerned
that
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
argument,
i've
left
the
impression
that
we
conceive
that
there
was
filed
an
eleven-cent
rate
or
that
the
commission
accepted
an
eleven-cent
rate.
we
do
not
conceive
either
of
those
and
that
would
be
the
second
point
of
my
argument.
that
argument
will
involve
three
considerations.
what
could
be
done
under
the
law?
we
will
show
that
the
natural
gas
act
and
order
174,
which
was
promulgated
pursuant
to
the
natural
gas
act,
did
not
permit
the
filing
of
the
rate
in
effect,
but
required
the
filing
of
the
contract
and
the
supplements
are
--
i
mean
that's
there,
too.
it
requires
a
consideration
of
what
the
petitioners
did
do.
and
we
will
examine
their
tender
great
schedule
filings
and
show
that
those
filings
show
on
their
face
that
they
reflected
the
price
situation
exactly
as
it
was,
that
is
the
contract
price
amended
by
the
kansas
minimum-price
order,
of
course,
if,
but
only
if,
that
order
was
valid.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
yes.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
it
is
in
terms
of
174.
the
pertinent
provisions
are
printed
in
the
appendix
to
pan
american's
brief,
at
page
66
and
67,
154.92.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
no,
a
copy
of
the
letter
was
not
filed
in
pan
american's
instance.
their
letter
of
transmittal
made
it
clear
that
their
sole
claim
to
the
price
was
the
eleven-cent
ordered
price
and
of
course
that
meant
that
it
depended
upon
its
validity.
154.92,
which
appears
on
page
66,
says
that
a
rate
schedule
shall
be
filed.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
beg
your
pardon.
pan
american's
main
brief
--
brief
for
petitioner
pan
american.
it's
in
the
appendix.
and
the
definition
of
the
rate
schedule
is
contained
on
the
next
page,
under
section
154.93,
which
--
at
page
67.
the
third
consideration,
of
course,
will
be
what
the
commission
did
and
what
--
in
light
of
what
the
commission
could
do.
and
in
discussing
the
commission's
acts,
we
will
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
commission
accepted
the
price
situation
as
it
was,
that
is,
the
contract
price
modified
by
the
kansas
minimum-price
order,
if
the
order
was
valid.
but
returning
to
what
seems
to
us
to
be
the
critical
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
or
not
the
superior
court
of
new
castle
county
has
jurisdiction.
that
turns,
in
our
view,
upon
the
interpretation
of
section
22
of
the
natural
gas
act.
section
22
confers
upon
the
federal
courts
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
that
limited
class
of
cases,
which,
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
are,
“brought
to
enforce
any
liability
or
duty
created
by
or
to
enjoin
any
violation
of
this
chapter
or
any
rule,
regulation
or
order
thereunder.”
of
course,
the
jurisdictional
provision
must
be
within
the
limits
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
prescribed
by
article
3
section
2
of
the
constitution,
which
defines
the
limits
of
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
so
forth.
in
both
the
house
committee
report
and
the
senate
committee
report
on
the
natural
gas
act,
the
committees
described
the
intent
and
purpose
of
section
22
in
identical
language
using
the
traditional
cases
arising
under
language
of
the
constitution.
the
language
reads,
“this
section
imposes
appropriate
jurisdiction
upon
the
courts
of
the
united
states
over
cases
arising
under
the
act.”
this
language
is
not
only
contained
in
the
constitution,
but
it
is
contained
in
the
older
jurisdictional
statutes
with
which
we're
familiar,
particularly
12
or
28
u.s.c.,
which
deals
with
federal
question
jurisdiction
and
28
u.s.c.1338,
which
deals
with
exclusive
federal
court
jurisdiction
in
patent
and
copyright
cases.
this
language
has
been
repeatedly
construed
by
this
court,
the
lower
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts.
i
don't
believe
that
it's
an
overstatement
to
say
that
at
least
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gully,
all
courts
have,
without
exception,
construed
this
language
to
mean
that
the
single
test
of
the
trial
court's
jurisdiction
is
a
statement
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
in
his
complaint,
unaided
by
any
defenses
which
maybe
raised
by
the
defendant
or
even
by
any
allegation
which
the
plaintiff
makes
in
anticipation
of
some
defense,
which
the
defendant
may
plead.
no
matter
how
carefully
it's
disguised,
the
petitioners'
position
here
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
must
be
to
urge
this
court
to
depart
from
this
traditional
test
and
adopt
a
new
test,
reconstruing
the
cases
arising
under
language
of
the
constitution.
for
they
urge
to
adopt
the
rule
under
which
the
trial
court's
jurisdiction
is
determined
from
an
examination
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
action,
irrespective
of
whether
the
filed
rate
comes
into
the
case
as
a
part
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
or
is
merely
injected
into
it
as
a
matter
of
good
faith.
the
single
excuse
which
is
offered
by
petitioners
for
this
radical
departure
is
a
claim
that
it
would
aid
the
uniform
construction
of
their
filed
rate
schedules.
they
rely
upon
cases
which
deal
with
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
the
national
labor
relations
act.
these
labor
relations
cases,
it
seemed
to
us,
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
neither
the
congress
nor
this
court
has
ever
regarded
exclusive
federal
court
jurisdiction
as
an
aid
or
a
device
to
promote
uniformity,
in
garner
versus
teamsters,
chauffeurs
and
helpers,
which
we
discussed
at
page
34
of
our
brief.
this
court
pointed
out
that
when
the
objective
is
uniformity
of
decision,
the
very
same
considerations
which
would
oust
state
courts
of
jurisdiction,
oust
federal
court
jurisdiction.
and
again,
a
year
later
in
amalgamated
clothing
workers
of
america
versus
richman
brothers,
another
labor
relations
case,
which
we
discussed
at
page
34
of
our
brief,
this
court
reviewed
the
history
of
our
dual
system
of
state
and
federal
court
jurisdiction.
and
there,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
courts
--
that
the
state
courts
have
always
been
regarded
as
perfectly
adequate
tribunals
for
the
resolution
of
federal
questions
which
are
injected
in
the
cases
as
a
matter
of
defense.
even
in
those
instances
in
which
the
conflict
is
between
regulatory
agency
jurisdiction
on
the
one
hand
and
court
jurisdiction
on
the
other,
either
state
or
federal,
this
court
pointed
out
that
uniformity
of
decision
is
provided
for
by
the
review
in
this
court.
that's
the
doctrine
announced
in
great
northern
railway
company
versus
merchants
elevator
company,
which
we
discussed
at
page
35
of
our
brief.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
well,
i
think
it
would
require
a
reconstruction
of
language
of
cases
arising
under,
which
is
used
--
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
--
in
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
no,
it
did
not.
they
construed
the
same
language.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
think
it
is
possible
of
course
that
the
constitutional
language
could
be
construed
differently
from
the
statutory
language.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
if
--
my
view
is,
if
that
came
within
the
limits
of
the
constitution
as
a
case
arising
under.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
that's
correct.
yes.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
--
i
think
that
is
substantially
it.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
think
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
in
the
final
analysis,
it
seems
to
us
that
petitioners'
argument
is
not
so
much
that
the
state
court
has
no
jurisdiction
as
it
is
that
plaintiff's
common-law
claims
which
have
been
asserted
in
the
state
court
are
without
merits
on
account
of
the
intervention
of
the
natural
gas
act
in
the
filed
rate
schedule.
i
mentioned
yesterday
that
our
cases
were
patterned
after
the
decisions
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
in
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
versus
harrington
and
the
district
court's
opinion
which
preceded
it.
that
case
was
on
all
force
with
the
case
at
bar,
it
involved
the
oklahoma
order,
which
this
court
held
to
be
invalid
in
1956
and
therefore,
preceded
our
cases
by
some
two
years.
i
call
the
court's
attention
particularly
to
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit,
for
there,
it
seems
to
us
that
they
deal
with
the
precise
contention
which
is
made
here
by
the
petitioners
and
that
is
that
these
common-law
rights
did
not
survive
the
natural
gas
act,
the
phillips'
decision
and
order
174.
and
there,
the
fifth
circuit,
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
in
mobil,
held
squarely
that
the
presence
of
regulation
of
producers'
process
by
the
natural
gas
act
did
not
defeat
the
pipeline
company's
common-law
rights
and
common-law
causes
of
action.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
doctrines
laid
down
in
mobil
and
in
memphis
in
which
this
court
held
about
the
natural
gas
act,
did
not
abrogate
contract
rights,
stands
squarely
for
the
proposition
that
these
claims
are
meritorious,
if
they
can
be
established
upon
their
facts.
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
sunray
mid-continent
case,
sunray
mid-continent
oil
company
versus
fpc
and
texas
gas
transmission
corporation
versus
shell
oil
company,
both
of
which
are
discussed
at
page
13
of
the
amicus
brief
of
colorado
interstate.
i
think
that
those
will
be
helpful
in
pointing
up
these
--
this
court's
view
as
to
the
interrelation
between
common-law
and
contract
rights
and
rights
which
arise
out
of
the
natural
gas
act.
i
have
mentioned
these
cses
particularly
because
its
petitioners'
suggestion
that
cities'
common-law
claims
are
fictitious
claims
and
therefore,
they
seek
to
apply
the
rule
of
this
court
in
the
lambert
case.
the
court
will
perhaps
recall
that
in
lambert,
a
shipper
sued
a
railroad
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
certain
shipping
rules
as
i
recall
8,
9
and
10
and
making
the
allegation
that
those
rules
were
the
rules
of
the
railroad
and
conflicted
with
rule
12
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
the
fact
was
that
rules
8,
9
and
10
were
not
the
railroad
company's
rules
at
all,
but
were
the
rules
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
this
court
held
that
by
simply
alleging
that
those
were
the
railroad
company's
rules,
it
could
not
oust
the
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction.
the
significant
point
is
that
the
section
22
of
the
natural
gas
act
has
no
application
to
these
cases
because
these
cases
were
not
brought
to
enforce
liabilities
created
by
the
act.
that
the
state
court
of
delaware
has
jurisdiction
over
these
cases
because
they
were
brought
to
enforce
liabilities
over
which
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction,
contract
liabilities
arising
out
of
state
law
and
common-law
--
and
common-law
doctrines
of
restitution
and
unjust
enrichment.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
it's
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
versus
harrington.
it
is
cited
at
page
--
at
pages
33
and
54
of
our
brief.
turning
now
to
our
second
point,
we
will
answer
petitioners'
claim
that
their
filed
rate
defense
is
--
will
be
a
meritorious
defense
when
these
cases
are
tried
below,
on
their
merits.
as
i
pointed
out,
we
do
not
view
this
as
being
an
issue
before
this
court,
but
we
do
think
that
it
is
appropriate,
since
this
seems
to
us,
to
be
the
whole
point
of
petitioners'
argument
to
discuss
the
matter
and
to
show
that
petitioners'
filed
rate
was
the
contract
rate
modified
by
the
kansas
minimum-price
order
if
that
order
was
valid.
we
rely
principally
upon
the
two
decisions
of
the
circuit
courts
who
have
examined
rate
schedule
such
as
these
in
which
there
was
filed
the
basic
gas
purchase
contract
and
the
copy
of
the
kansas
minimum-price
order
or
--
those
cases
are
cities
service
gas
company
versus
fpc,
to
which
we
referred
as
magnolia,
since
magnolia
petroleum
corporation
was
the
intervenor
and
it
was
its
rate
schedule,
as
cited
and
discussed
at
page
36
of
our
brief.
and
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
versus
fpc,
dorchester
corporation,
intervenor,
which
we
describe
as
the
--
referred
to
as
the
dorchester
case.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
circuit
courts
held
that
in
view
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
holding
that
the
oklahoma
price
order
in
the
dorchester
case
was
void.
and
the
kansas
price
order
in
the
magnolia
case
was
void.
that
in
view
of
that
decision,
these
rate
schedules
fixed
the
legally
effective
rate
at
the
contract
rate
unmodified
by
the
void
order.
it
simply
--
those
courts
simply
held
that
the
void
order
could
not
amend
or
modify
a
contract.
let
us
examine
in
detail,
what
could
be
done
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
order
174.
as
we
understand
the
petitioners'
position,
they
conceive
that
their
initial
rate
filings
initiated
a
rate-making
or
a
rate-changing
procedure,
under
which
the
federal
power
commission
set
aside
the
contract
and
contractualobligations
which
ran
between
us
and
made
new
obligations
for
us
without
a
hearing,
without
the
parties
being
present
and
solely
on
the
basis
of
an
ex
parte
fact.
in
the
mobil
case,
this
court
reviewed
it
later
the
powers
of
the
federal
power
commission
as
defined
in
sections
5
(a)
and
4
(e)
of
the
act.
this
court
said
that
section
5
(a)
prescribed
the
basic
power
of
the
federal
power
commission
with
respect
to
rates.
giving
it
the
power
to
conduct
hearings
and
make
determination
after
hearings
with
respect
to
a
contract
which
had
been
filed
with
it
and
upon
the
finding
that
the
rates
fixed
in
the
contract
were
unjust
and
unreasonable,
then
to
remedy
that,
by
setting
aside
and
--
or
modifying
those
contract
rates.
this
court
said,
“this
is
neither
a
rate-making
nor
a
rate-changing
procedure.
it
is
simply
the
power
to
review
the
rates
and
contracts
made
in
the
first
instance
by
natural
gas
companies
and
if
they
are
to
be
--
determined
to
be
unlawful,
to
remedy
them.”
the
commission's
order
174,
under
which
these
filings
were
made,
were
limited
to
procedural
matters
only
and
were
not
intended
to
affect
substantive
rights
after
hearings
and
after
two
amendments
to
the
order.
the
commission
entered
its
order
174-b
and
with
it,
it
filed
an
opinion
in
which
it
expressed
this
view
of
what
it
was
doing
in
order
174.
it
said,
and
i
quote,
“substantive
rules,
however,
do
not
appear
desirable
in
connection
with
the
filings
with
which
these
rules
are
concerned,
and
it
is
the
intention
of
the
commission
to
relate
these
rules
strictly
to
procedural
matters.”
order
174
did
not
permit
the
filing
of
the
rate
in
effect
on
june
7,
1954.
i
asked
the
court
to
turn
its
attention
to
the
provisions
of
order
174.
it
is
found
in
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
pan
american
petroleum
corporation.

hereof,
“rate

supplements
and
agreements
are
mandatory
thereof,
effective
and
applicable
on
and
after
june
7,
1954,”
and
so
forth.
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
explain
that
the
schedules
which
were
filed
were
not
simply
a
schedule
of
rates
in
the
railroad
tariff,
the
sense
of
the
term,
but
were
copies
of
all
of
the
documents
which
comprise
the
basic
contract,
the
amendments
and
the
supplements
thereto.
pan
american's
entire
rate
schedule
is
printed
in
this
record.
it
consists
of
the
basic
gas
purchase
contract
and
78
supplementary
agreements
and
amendments
thereto.
it
occupies
274
pages
of
the
printed
record.
there
was
no
requirement
for
the
statement
of
any
rate
of
it
than
that
it
did
require
that
there
be
filed
also,
but
not
as
a
part
of
the
rate
schedule,
a
billing
state
that
is
found
in
the
last
sentence
of
154.92.
having
said
what
the
rate
schedule
was,
the
--
they
then
--
the
rule
then
said
that
to
each
rate
schedule,
there
shall
be
attached
the
statement
showing
the
actual
billing.

charles

(a).
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
yes,
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
three
circuit
or
the
tenth
circuit
court
in
three
different
cases,
which
we
cite
at
page
39
of
our
brief,
has
held
squarely
that
this
billing
statement
is
not
a
part
of
the
rate
schedule,
but
is
simply
a
statement
as
to
--
which
does
not
affect
the
level
of
the
rate
at
all.
and
if
the
billing
and
as
pointed
out
in
those
three
cases,
the
two
cases
involving
--
involving
phillips
petroleum
company
in
one
case
following
--
involving
kerr-mcgee.
if
the
--
the
billing
statement
does
not
affect
the
rate
at
all,
the
rate
is
made
by
the
basic
gas
purchase
contract
and
the
amendments
and
supplements
thereto.
i
think
it
is
significant
that
order
174
did
not
require
that
the
federal
power
commission
give
the
purchaser
any
notice
of
this
fact.
it
did
not
contemplate
that
there
be
conducted
in
hearing
on
the
filings,
did
not
contemplate
that
there
be
--
that
the
commission
make
any
findings
or
draw
any
conclusions.
and
i
think
from
the
examination
of
the
commission's
acts
and
it
will
be
perfectly
apparent
that
the
commission
gave
no
notice
that
they
did
not
docket
these
filings
for
hearing,
that
they
conducted
no
hearing,
that
they
made
no
findings
and
that
they
drew
no
conclusions.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
we
did
receive
a
copy
of
each
one.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
yes,
from
the
sellers,
that's
correct.
it's
our
view
that
the
absence
of
these
minimum
essentials
of
due
process
is
prove
positive
that
the
commission
did
not
and
could
not
have
affected
--
could
have
affected
substantive
rights
of
the
parties,
but
they
were
bound
to
preserve
the
status
quo
as
it
was
on
the
critical
date,
june
7,
1954.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
think
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
which
picks
the
rate?
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
do
not
think
so.
no,
sir.
i
think
that
it
fixed
the
rate,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
common-law.
i
did
no
--
i
do
not
think
that
it
abrogated
the
common-law
rights
upon
which
we
rely.
may
i
give
this
example,
for
--
suppose
we
--
our
check
which
we
had
given
to
pan
american
for
one
of
these
gas
payments
had
been
dishonored,
i
think
they
could've
sued
us
to
collect
on
the
check.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
believe,
effects
what
i
said,
i
overstated
it.
i
--
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
in
natural
gas
pipe
versus
harrington,
the
defense
was
made
that
on
account
of
--
the
intervention
of
the
phillips
case
and
the
regulation
of
independent
producers
because
the
plaintiff
did
not
rely
upon
the
filed
rate
and
because,
in
fact,
harrington
had
not
made
a
file,
there
could
be
no
recovery
of
any
kind,
and
the
circuit
court
relying
upon
this
court's
decision
in
mobil
said
that
phillips
and
order
174
fixed
the
rate
at
the
contract
rate
and
that
it
was
not
significant,
either
that
they
did
or
did
not
have
a
filing.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
decision
which
touches
very
closely
upon
the
contention
that
the
natural
gas
act
occupies
the
whole
field.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
the
same
as
we
had
the
product.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
yes,
each
check
board
docketed
--
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
--
exactly
the
same
legend.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
am
doubtful
that
we
could.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
--
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
don't
--
i
don't
conceive
they
do
have.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
oh,
i
think
that
it
would
be.
and
i
understand
--
and
i
understand
that
that's
the
principle
in
great
northern,
that
when
it
involves
pure
questions
of
law
as
this
does
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
the
commission
to
pass
upon.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
that's
my
view
of
the
matter,
under
the
announcement
that
particularly
those
in
the
labor
relation
cases
to
which
i
have
referred
and
of
course,
the
traditional
cases
which
hold
that
a
state
court
is
a
perfectly
adequate
tribunal
to
pass
on
these
federal
questions
that
it
turns
upon
whether
it's
the
plaintiff
who
bases
his
claim
on
it
or
it's
the
defendant
relying
upon.
the
second
consideration
is
what
is
the
filed
rate?
what
rates
the
petitioners'
file,
and
i
think
in
examination
of
their
letter
or
particularly
a
pan
american's
letter
of
transmittal,
will
disclose
clearly
that
they
said
to
the
commission,
“our
filed
rate
is
the
contract
rate.”
however,
there
is
now
in
existence
the
kansas
minimum
price-order.
it
has
been
a
--
a
state
regulation
of
price
has
been
held
to
be
valid
and
of
course,
if
this
is
valid,
then
the
price
is
amended
by
that
minimum-price
order.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
the
letter
of
transmittal
appears
at
page
593
of
the
record.
if
i
may
move
on,
i
think
also
that
an
examination
of
these
tabulation
in
which
the
eleven-cent
price,
which
was
called
to
your
attention
by
mr.
gray
yesterday,
is
footnoted
"kansas
minimum-price
order"
and
this
tabulation
is
at
page
638,
shows
clearly
that
at
all
times
everyone
recognized
that
the
sole
claim
to
the
eleven-cent
price
was
the
kansas
minimum-price
order
and
therefore
was
wholly
dependent
upon
its
validity.
if
what
we
are
looking
for
is
something
definitive
which
the
commission
did,
which
indicated
its
view,
seems
to
me,
that
the
only
definitive
thing
which
they
ever
did
was
to
cover
the
matter
in
cities'
rate
settlement
order.
immediately
after
the
decision
or
the
promulgation
of
the
kansas
order
in
may
1954,
cities
sought
an
increase
in
its
own
rates,
before
the
federal
power
commission
relying
largely
upon
the
increase
cost
to
it
of
purchase
gas,
occasioned
by
the
minimum
price
order.
in
that
order,
in
settling
that
case,
the
commission
granted
as
to
increased
rates
based
upon
with
the
increased
cost,
occasioned
by
the
kansas
price
order.
but
they
made
the
requirement
that
if
the
kansas
order
was
determined
to
be
invalid
and
if
cities
received
refunds
on
account
of
litigation
such
as
this,
then
those
refund
should
be
passed
back
to
our
customers
in
the
proportions
in
which
they
had
borne
the
increased
cost.
sure,
if,
when
petitioners
filed
these
rates
cases,
their
rates
became
fixed
at
the
eleven-cent
price,
there
would've
been
no
occasion
for
the
commission
to
have
made
a
provision
for
refunds,
when
and
if
the
price
order
was
held
to
be
invalid
and
we
received
those
refunds.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
yes.
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
our
customers
get
the
money
to
the
extent
that
they
have
borne
them.
in
other
words,
all
of
the
money
which
they
have
paid
on
account
of
increased
cost
is
returned
to
them.
now,
you
understand
of
course
--
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
v.wheeler
that
is
in
the
order
in
docket
g2410.
it's
in
the
record.

beg
your
pardon.
