justice

frankfurter
the
great
northern
case
came
up
on
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
your
--
then
your
answer
--
that's
what
i
thought,
so
i
haven't
looked
it
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

it
must
be
in
any
event
of
federal
court
that
isn't
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
--
is
there
a
state
jurisdiction
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
controversy
between
you
and
the
respondents
that
if
this
were
a
proceeding
for
the
review
of
an
order
by
the
federal
power
commission,
the
state
court
would
have
no
jurisdiction,
put
that
general
proposition,
is
there
--
is
there
conflict?
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
the
respondents
say,
this
is
an
action
to
review
an
order
of
the
state
of
the
federal
power
commission,
and
they
have
a
right
to
bring
such
a
reviewing
order
in
the
state
court,
do
they
claim
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
yes,
but
here,
the
respondent,
i
don't
make
my
question
clear,
do
they
concede
your
general
proposition
that
this
is
a
proceeding
to
review
an
order
of
the
federal
power
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
what's
the
use
of
arguing
the
abstract
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
that's
what
you
have
to
argue
that
this
is
such
a
reviewing
order
not
that
if
it
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
course
the
state
court
is
ousted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
--
that's
what
you
have
to
prove,
the
other
side
contest
that.
and
the
court
didn't
go
on
that
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
--
didn't
involve
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
challenging
that
you
may
prove
that
in
--
necessarily,
what
is
involved
is
a
review
of
the
federal
power
commission,
but
they
--
that
abstraction
question
that
they
came
to
do,
doesn't
require
it
at
all,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
to
anybody.
they
did
it
to
the
court
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
delaware.
they
said
it
wasn't
such
a
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
merely
inviting,
you've
established
on
the
fact
in
this
case,
that
(inaudible)
i'm
inviting
you
to
establish
the
fact
that,
in
fact,
this
does
what
you
just
said
it
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
couldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
partly
--
partly
i
have
in
mind
what
justice
douglas
has
been
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
the
court
--
what
the
(inaudible)
court
said
in
effect?
it
is
argued
by
you
and
your
associate
that
form
can
make
no
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
form
can
make
all
of
the
difference
in
the
world
with
reference
to
federal
jurisdiction,
as
in
gully
case
proved
once
and
for
all.
if
you
can
pray
--
if
you
can
pray
the
complaint
whereby
you
do
not
reveal
that
a
federal
defense
whereby
you
do
not
rest
on
a
federal
claim,
but
the
federal
claim
comes
in
by
a
way
of
defense,
then
the
gully
case
prove,
you
can
state
a
cause
of
action.
i'm
not
saying
this
is
the
gully
case,
but
you
have
to
take
care
of
the
gully
case.
it
doesn't
do
to
make
this
generality
a
form,
never
makes
a
difference
in
federal
jurisdiction.
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
of
great
deal
of
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
it
--
it
would
be
avoided
because
if
the
defense
comes
in
and
the
state
court
rules
against
the
proper
defense,
then
you
come
here
from
the
state
court.
the
question
here
is
whether
--
may
be
initiated
not
where
finally
maybe
determined.
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
what
period
of
the
--
of
the
47-48
months,
whatever
it
was,
was
there
a
federal
power
rate
enforced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
did
the
--
when
did
your
claim
begin
to
arise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
were
coterminous?
i
--
i
missed
the
date.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
--
after
june,
after
there
was
a
federal
rate.
it
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wheeler,
may
i
ask
you
this.
how
could
the
federal
rates
was
enforced,
could
any
arrangement
be
made
for
an
alteration
in
the
up
or
down
of
the
rates?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean,
private
--
i
--
yes,
i
understand,
apart
from
the
procedure
provided
by
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not.
therefore,
any
suit,
but
you
have
to
(inaudible)
that
any
suit
for
a
different
rate
in
the
filed
rate
subject
to
all
the
(inaudible)
taken
under
the
federal
power
act,
no
matter
--
what
--
in
what
guide,
in
what
(inaudible)
of
--
of
legal
pleading,
you
may
come
into
court?
would
a
court
--
any
court
had
to
take
judicial
notice
if
what
you
are
suing
for
is
something
that
would
undermine
its
governing
rate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
if
you
acquired,
if
you
plead
without
making
a
disclosure
as
to
what
the
rates
are,
would
the
court
be
charged
with
the
duty
of
finding
out
what
the
rate
is?
because
they'll
throw
you
out
of
court
on
the
face
of
the
pleading
and
not
waiting
for
the
--
and
not
bring
it
under
the
gully
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
gully
case,
couldn't
the
court
have
found
out
what
the
law
was
if
you
are
going
to
find
the
--
the
complaints
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
rest
under
gully
case
doctrine
and
that
kind
of
a
thing
or
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
you
but
you
do
--
it
is
--
if
you
--
if
you
prevail,
and
to
get
whether
the
--
does
the
delaware
case
cited
from
gully
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
delaware
decision
cite
in
gully
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
is
--
that
is
what
the
fighting
is
about
here,
isn't
it,
whether
the
gully
case
doctrine
applies
or
not?
in
other
words,
whether
if
you
do
not
disclose
on
the
face
of
your
complaint
that
you
are
speaking
of
deposit
from
the
filed
rate,
you
establish
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
and
all
the
rest
is
subject
to
the
merits
and
the
litigation
on
the
merits
have
you
mention
--
appeal
here,
the
state
court
disregard
federal
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
forgive
me
for
interrupting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
again?
where
in
the
complaint
did
you
refer
me
to
the
(inaudible)
where
in
the
complaint
is
there
any
reference
as
what
the
valid
--
of
valid
rate
was
or
wasn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
allegation
that
bore
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thank
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
wheeler,
should
the
--
should
the
delaware
court
or
any
delaware
court,
should
the
delaware
supreme
court
finally
say
you
can't
raise
that
question?
that
in
itself
should
be
a
basis
for
coming
to
this.
if
--
if
the
delaware
court
excluded
the
petitioners
from
defending,
by
standing
on
the
federal
rates,
that
in
--
that
denial
or
that
exclusion
itself
is
a
denial
of
a
federal
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
the
answer
to
--
that's
the
conclusive
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
isn't
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
isn't
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
you
(inaudible)
you
must
answer
every
argument
that
could
be
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
so
that
you
can
win
here
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wheeler,
you
are
not
suggesting
or
are
you,
that
congress
that
--
there
wasn't
any
constitutional
limitation
upon
the
withdrawal
by
the
congress
of
cases
that
raise
the
federal
questions
by
way
of
defense?
in
other
words,
that
congress
by
appropriate
language
that
you
say
is
not
found
here
though
events
imply.
congress
could
say
that
if
an
issue
is
--
is
raised
by
the
defendant
in
answer
to
a
complaint,
which
brings
into
issue
of
federal
statute
or
a
federal
right,
such
a
controversy
is
--
is
not
be
entertainable
on
the
state
court,
that
must
itself,
be
initiated
in
the
federal
courts.
you
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
difficulty
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
another
occasion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
go
unconstitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
there
is
an
issue
in
a
controversy,
if
an
issue
is
created
by
pleading
involving
a
federal
question,
congress
could
say
that
such
litigations
cannot
be
entertained
by
a
state
court,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
gully
--
the
gully
case
brings
the
issue
whether
in
that
case
involving
a
national
banking
act,
whether
that
was
the
question
that
arose
under
an
act
of
congress
and
it's
found
that
it
didn't
arise
for
the
reason
it
has
exposed.
although,
the
defense
that
was
tendered
if
it
prevailed
upon
the
merits,
the
defendant
had
prevailed
what
involved
a
federal
claim,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
issue
where
he
is
whether
under
the
statute,
this
case
arose
in
the
light
of
the
gully
doctrine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
narrow
--
not
--
not
narrow,
but
that's
the
defined
principle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
gray?
justice
felix
frankfurter
767,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gray,
is
all
this
in
the
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
any
of
the
pleading
set
this
forth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
--
did
--
what
you
read
--
what
you
have
just
read
--
what
you're
referring
to
as
contained
in
the
brief
put
anything
like
that
set
any
pleading
by
the
complainant
--
by
plaintiffs
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
278.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
depends
what
the
--
what
the
governing
documents
are
for
ascertaining
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
governing
document
is
the
complaint.
that's
one
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
prevent
them
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
a
governing
document,
is
it,
the
governing
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
going
to
stop
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
more
thing
about
the
gully
case?
suppose
there's
been
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
the
gully
case
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint,
the
answer
and
the
petition
for
removal,
according
to
your
view
--
according
to
your
view,
the
state
court
would
then
have
been
ousted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
answer
and
a
--
a
petition
for
removal
had
set
forth
that
the
ultimate
reliance
was
the
national
banking
act
which
allowed
the
state
to
tax
national
bank
shares.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
according
to
the
rules,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
sweeps
everything
that
received
it
into
the
complaint.
i'm
asking
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
a
pleader
can
choose
what
he
puts
in
his
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
isn't
determined
and
he
doesn't
absorb
or
incorporate
by
a
necessity,
what
the
answer
sets
forth.
and
so,
i'm
asking
you
whether
if
gully
--
in
gully
there'd
been
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
answer
which
did
disclose
that
the
right
to
tax
derived
from
the
federal
statute
rule
5209,
i
believe,
would
be
a
result
in
gully
have
been
different,
according
to
your
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
forget
about
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--removal.
the
answer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suppose
the
answer,
as
it
did
in
this
--
in
the
gully
case,
disclosed
that
what
complaint
is
really
after
is
to
--
to
avail
itself,
what
the
complaint
had
been
--
gully
was
after,
was
to
avail
itself
of
the
federal
act
which
authorizes
a
state
under
defined
conditions
to
levy
a
tax
on
national
bank
shares.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
that
is
the
court
is,
if
i
may
use
a
--
the
phrase
from
a
different
area
of
color
blind
as
to
what
exists
outside
of
the
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
related
--
it
would
be
more.
the
only
basis
on
which
up
to
time
that
congress
passed
that
act,
a
state
could
not
tax
national
bank
shares,
could
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
right
certainty,
if
any
right
ever
derived
from
federal
authority,
it
was
the
right
of
states
to
tax
national
bank
shares
given
to
them
by
the
act
whenever
it
was,
in
60
something,
rather
60,
70.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
repeating
what
you
just
said,
when
does
the
court
lose
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
make
a
distinction
between
a
state
court
losing
jurisdiction
and
a
federal
court
not
being
able
to
acquire
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
because
if
there
was
a
federal
right,
then
there
was
right
to
removal
in
gully.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
court
denied
that
right
because
it
said
a
federal
right
wasn't
revealed
by
the
complaint
and
it
didn't
go
beyond
that.
although,
although
on
the
merits,
although
on
the
merits,
it
became
perfectly
clear
that
the
right
did
derive
from
a
federal
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
the
same
--
mr.
gray,
it's
the
same
statutory
provision
of
jurisdiction,
namely,
a
right
arising
under
a
federal
act
of
the
constitution.
it
can't
be
a
--
arising
under
the
federal
act,
not
arising
under
the
--
under
the
removal
statute
but
arising
under
the
state
jury
--
under
the
exclusive
statute.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
excludes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
whenever
it
appears.
whenever
it
appears
under
the
conditions
under
which
appearance
is
legally
revealed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
