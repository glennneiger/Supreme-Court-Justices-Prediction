did
that
filing
or
those
filings,
on
their
face,
show
that
they
were
conditional
or
subject
to
modification
to
the
extent
of
the
possibilities
that
would
occur
in
the
event
of
a
declaration
of
invalidity
of
the
kansas
order?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
didn't
pan

also
file
a

of

it

assume
that
it's
true
that
primary
jurisdiction
was
in
the
federal
power
commission.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yet,
if
there
are
no
facts
or
discretions
to
be
exercised
and
the
question
emerging
is
but
one
of
law,
then
under
mr.
justice
brandies'
opinion
in
the
great
northern
case
could
not
accord
to
general
and
common-law
jurisdiction
even
this
court
adjudicated?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
very
briefly,
what
defense
is
asserted
as
to
do
six
months
period?

once
the
rate
is
approved
to
contracts
by
the
commission,
then
is
not
that
the
sole
and
only
lawful
rate
from
that
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
may
there
be
a
side
agreement
continuing
private
character
between
this
producer
and
the
pipeline
for
something
more?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then,
did
your
contract,
when
approved
by
the
commission,
become
the
whole
law
of
the
subject
of
rates?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understood
you
to
say
that's
why
i
was
in
this
fifth
circuit
case
that
they
had
expressively
held
that
the
private
rights
continued
on
the
contract,
notwithstanding
the
filing
of
it
with
the
commission,
did
i
misunderstood
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
probably
misunderstood
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
as
--
may
i
ask
you
this.
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
primary
jurisdiction
would
require
action
initially
before
the
commission?
yet,
if,
as
you
argue
here,
no
question
of
fact
is
involved,
no
discretion
is
to
be
exercised
by
the
commission,
would
it
be
more
than
a
useless
act
to
send
the
case
there
when
the
question
is
one
of
law
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
could
a
state
court
as
well
as
federal
court
have
power
to
decide
that
issue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
i
do
not
understand
you
to
contend
or
do
you
contend
that
the
affidavits
and
the
exhibits
on
file,
used
in
support
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
constitute
a
part
of
the
pleadings,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
does
the
jurisdiction
depend
though
upon
the
affirmance
of
the
bill?
