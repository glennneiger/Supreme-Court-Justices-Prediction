mr.
byron
m.gray
may
the
court
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
--
please.
the
first
question
which
i
would
like
to
address
myself
is
the
gully
case.
and
i
want
to
demonstrate
that
the
gully
case
simply
has
no
application
here.
under
the
rules
of
the
delaware
courts,
they
follow
very
much
the
same
procedure.
the
fact
as
i
check
it
is
exactly
the
same
procedure
as
the
federal
--
several
rules
prove
several
practices.
and
after
cities
had
filed
their
complaint,
after
they
had
filed
their
complaint,
they
then
and
before
anyone
had
answered,
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
attached
thereto
affidavits
and
certain
certified
copies
of
various
documents
including
the
entire
rate
filing
made
before
the
federal
power
commission
and
that
was
before
anyone
had
answered.
and
then
they
moved,
as
i
say,
for
a
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
rate
filings
made
by
pan
american
before
the
federal
power
commission.
a
--
they
demand
and
they
attached
thereto,
a
true
and
correct
copy,
a
certified
copy
of
all
these
documents
i'm
telling
you
about
including
the
letter
of
the
federal
power
commission
accepting
the
rate
of
pan
american.
and
now,
they
say
it
wasn't
an
eleven-cent
rate,
although
they
paid
it
for
three
years.
so,
that
is
on
page
278
of
this
record,
is
their
motion
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
byron
m.gray
for
summary
judgment,
i
say
their
protest
ran
to
the
payment
of
the
eleven
cents
by
virtue
of
the
kansas
order.
but
after
that
rate
was
filed
and
accepted
and
was
the
rate
on
file
with
the
federal
power
commission,
they
were
paying
it
by
virtue
of
the
fact,
it
was
the
filed
rate.
but
i
attract
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
first
brought
on
to
this
record,
the
entire
rate
filing
including
the
letter
of
acceptance
by
the
federal
power
commission.
they
did
it
in
a
motion
for
a
summary
judgment.
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes,
the
notation
was
there.
that
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
--
is
correct.
mr.
byron
m.gray
no.
no,
that
--
that's
correct.
if
common-law
doctrine
were
to
apply,
that
would
certainly
have
a
bearing.
but
i
--
i
want
to
show
you
that
these
--
that
cities
are
the
persons
who
first
brought
the
federal
question
in
and
first
shown
that
--
that
this
action
is
an
action
that
is,
in
effect,
an
action
based
upon
a
law
of
the
united
states
because
a
rate
properly
on
file
with
a
federal
agency
has
the
effect
of
law.
now,
what
argument
did
they
make?
in
their
brief
in
support
of
their
motion
and
this
--
this
--
for
their
motion
for
summary
judgment,
based
on
these
documents
under
the
heading
and
this,
i'm
reading
from
767
of
the
record,
“(g)
the
law
permits
no
deviation
from
the
defendants'
filed
rate
of
8.4
cents
per
mcf.”
and
now
i'm
reading
from
their
brief
in
the
trial
court
before
there
was
any
answer.
they
say
“we
have
shown
that
defendants'
filed
rate
schedule
fixes
the
price
for
this
gas
at
the
contract
rate,
8.4
cents.
defendant
cannot
claim
any
other
price.”
this
is
their
brief
before
any
answer.
“the
rate
fixed
by
defendant's
rate
schedule
is
binding
upon
plaintiff
and
defendant
and
upon
this
court
with
the
force
and
effect
of
federal
statute.”
that
is
the
words
of
cities
in
the
trial
court,
in
their
brief.
mr.
byron
m.gray
i
am
reading
from
page
767
of
the
record.
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes.
mr.
byron
m.gray
thank
you
very
much.
now,
they
say
themselves
it
has
the
force
and
effect
of
a
federal
statute.
that's
a
very
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes.
mr.
byron
m.gray
in
the
brief
that
they
filed
in
support
of
their
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
byron
m.gray
any
of
the
pleadings?
mr.
byron
m.gray
in
their
motion
for
summary
judgment,
yes.
that
is
only
--
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
sets
all
of
that
out
and
then
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes,
their
motion
for
summary
judgment
starts
on
page
7
--
no,
278
of
the
record.
mr.
byron
m.gray
and
then
it
continues
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
278
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
--
of
the
record
and
one
of
the
bases
of
their
motion
is
the
fact
that
they
attached
exhibit
3,
which
is
a
true
and
correct
copy
of
pan
american
petroleum's
file
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
byron
m.gray
well
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
i'm
attempting
to
show
that
the
gully
doctrine
does
not
apply
and
that's
my
purpose
here.
and
it
just
seems
to
me
--
i
can't
to
follow
someone
who
says
they
have
jurisdiction
because
it
isn't
inconsistent
for
me
to
have.
it
either
have
jurisdiction
and
it
don't
have,
in
my
judgment.
but
i
--
i
have
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes,
i
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
--
quite
agree
with
that.
mr.
byron
m.gray
the
complaint
and
as
you
know
the
federal
rules
and
the
rules
in
delaware
make
this
motion
for
summary
judgment
as
much
as
the
pleadings
as
their
complaint,
just
as
rule
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
--
15
(b)
of
--
of
our
federal
rules
make
it
and
i
say
that
that's
a
governing
document
and
they
first
brought
it
under
this
record.
mr.
byron
m.gray
well,
it
--
it
must
surely
be
a
part
of
it
and
i
think
i
--
if
i
can
get
to
it,
then
i'll
show
you
how
it
works
right
in
the
governing.
mr.
byron
m.gray
thank
you.
i
don't
mind
--
i
don't
mind
at
all
of
course,
but
the
trial
court
now,
what
did
the
trial
court
do?
the
trial
court
said,
“thus,
it
became
apparent.”
how
did
the
trial
court
treat
that
document?
it
became
apparent
that
a
major
issue
in
this
case
is
the
determination
on
what
rates
was
the
filed
rate
and
then
it
came
on
over
and
it
said
as
follows,
“the
question
then
becomes
what
rate
was
legally
filed.”
now,
that's
the
issue
the
trial
court
said
it
was
deciding
and
that's
the
issue
i
say
they
couldn't
have
decided
and
then
it
gets
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court
says,
“being
void
because
a
kansas
order
was
void,
they're
going
back
in
doing
what
you'd
have
to
do
under
section
19,
the
review
statute.
being
void,
the
unilateral
filing
of
the
order
as
part
of
the
rate
scheduled
for
the
nullities."
and
that
was
what
was
done
in
dorchester
and
in
both
of
the
cases
that
--
in
mobil,
they
followed
section
19,
but
now,
i
want
to
move
to
gully
and
here's
what
the
doctrine
of
gully
is
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
“a
suit
to
enforce
a
right
which
takes
its
origin
in
the
laws
of
the
united
states
is
not
necessarily
or
for
that
reason
alone,
one
arising
under
those
laws
for
a
suit
does
not
so
arise,
unless
it
really
and
substantially
involves
a
dispute
or
controversy
respecting
the
validity,
construction
or
effect
of
such
a
law
upon
the
determination
of
which
the
result
depends.”
and
i
say
now
that
once
a
rate
becomes
the
legally
filed
rate
with
a
federal
agency,
it
becomes
a
part
of
the
body
of
the
federal
law.
and
this
court
has
said
that
time
and
again.
for
example,
in
crancer
versus
lowden,
315
u.s.,
i
think,
this
may
not
be
in
our
brief.
that
--
this
court
said,
“until
changed,
tariffs
bind
both
carriers
and
shippers
with
the
force
of
law.”
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
court
says
that
it
must
decide
what
was
the
filed
rate
that
that's
the
issue
in
the
trial
court
and
when
the
supreme
court
supports
them
in
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
certainly,
they've
met
the
test
of
the
gully
case,
that
they
are
construing
and
that
the
determination
of
the
case
depends
upon
the
interpretation
of
federal
law.
mr.
byron
m.gray
was
the
removal
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
oh,
no.
no,
they
have
the
case,
this
same
case
involving
the
same
$10,300,000.
it's
filed
in
the
federal
court
at
delaware
and
as
far
as
jurisdiction
goes,
if
they
can
get
jurisdiction
of
the
persons,
it
would
be
a
section
22
case
filed
as
a
section
22
case.
it
is
there
and
of
course,
will
have
to
be
tried
on
the
question
of
what
is
the
filed
rate.
but
what
i
do
say
is
this
that
section
19
also
involved
here.
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
to
accomplish
what
they
should've
accomplished
if
it
could
be
accomplished
under
section
19
and
they
cite
the
magnolia
and
the
dorchester
cases
to
you.
and
in
those
cases,
the
filings
under
174
were
appealed
from
through
section
19
and
they
went
up
to
the
circuit
court.
they're
asking
a
state
court
to
do
and
the
state
court
in
fact
is
doing
what
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
would've
had
to
do.
that
is
under
section
19.
and
magnolia,
all
those
cases
went
up
under
section
19.
but
the
harrington
case
that
they
cite
to
you
was
before
the
order
number
174,
all
the
chip,
all
of
the
sales
made
in
the
harrington.
all
of
the
price
is
paid.
that
was
all
before
there
was
any
filed
rate.
and
i
think
harrington
was
wrong
in
principle,
itself.
i
think
it
conflicts
with
your
decision
in
panoma
and
the
kansas
case
because
i
think
you
held
there
in
effect
that
the
natural
gas
act
simply
preempted
the
field
and
didn't
leave
any
place
for
anything
but
federal
regulation
and
the
jurisdiction
arising
out
of
the
natural
gas
act.
that's
the
way
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
impossible
to
--
to
think
otherwise.
now,
there's
one
thing
i
--
in
their
brief
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
byron
m.gray
had
there
been
a
removal
petition?
mr.
byron
m.gray
oh,
yes.
mr.
byron
m.gray
oh,
no.
no,
i
--
i
wasn't
meaning
to
say
that.
if
i
said
it,
i
--
i
didn't
mean
that.
mr.
byron
m.gray
i
think
that
15
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
has
the
effect
of
putting
everything
in
the
complaint
that
is
essential
to
that
complaint
and
it
does
it
automatically,
at
least
that's
where
i
read
the
rules.
mr.
byron
m.gray
he
can
choose
what
he
puts
in
his
complaint.
mr.
byron
m.gray
well,
i
think
it
--
i
have
to
weigh
the
side
of
the
fact,
if
my
recollection
is
correct
that
you
have
to
file
your
removal
petition
within
20
days
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
--
before
a
certain
time.
but
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
--
waiving
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
as
i
read
the
gully
case,
i
had
the
feeling
that
the
answer
to
you
would
be
that
you'd
have
the
same
result
in
gully.
mr.
byron
m.gray
well,
i
--
i
rather
read
gully
to
--
to
say
it
wasn't
closely
enough
related
to
the
federal
law
and
that
they
couldn't
be
having
cases
removed
from
the
state
courts
that
just
might
touch
upon
federal
law.
that's
the
way
i
read
gully.
mr.
byron
m.gray
that's
correct.
mr.
byron
m.gray
that
was
gully
only.
mr.
byron
m.gray
i
say
that
as
of
that
time,
it
became
apparent
that
their
action
was
not
at
all
an
action
at
common-law
to
enforce
contract,
but
it
became
apparent
that
the
right
of
action
sprung
from
the
natural
gas
act,
if
they
had
any.
mr.
byron
m.gray
not
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
i
say
that
at
anytime,
and
i
think
this
is
a
law
and
we
have
endless
cases
on
it
and
some
in
our
brief,
that
when
it
appears
that
the
subject
matter
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
however
it
appears
and
that
--
that
court
looses
jurisdiction
and
that's
what
happened.
it's
bound
to
have
happened
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
whenever
it
appears
that
the
court
has
no
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
action.
and
i
say
that
that
appeared
when
they
showed
that
these
movements
were
movements
of
--
of
gas
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
and
that
was
the
subject
matter
of
their
action
and
when
that
appeared
regardless
of
how
it
appeared
that
court
lost
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes,
i
have
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
well
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
yes.
it
--
mr.
byron
m.gray
and
that
was
after
it
had
been
removed,
but
i
do
make
that
distinction
and
then
i
think
it
is
clearly
the
law
and
that's
on
our
brief.
mr.
byron
m.gray
well,
as
i
--
as
i
would
see
it,
the
statute
--
the
federal
statute
excludes
the
state's
jurisdiction
and
i
think
it
has
a
right
to
do
it.
mr.
byron
m.gray
and
whenever
it
appeared
that
that
was
a
subject
matter,
your
exclusionary
statute,
22
came
into
effect.
that's
my
thought.
mr.
byron
m.gray
well,
i
--
i
really
think
whenever
it
appears.
