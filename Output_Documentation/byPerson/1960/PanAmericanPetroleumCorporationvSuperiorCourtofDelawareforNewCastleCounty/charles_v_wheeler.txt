mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
here
have
spent
a
large
part
of
their
argument
as
they
have
in
their
oral
argument
in
their
briefs
in
discussing
matters
which
go
to
the
judgment
which
should
be
rendered
in
the
trial
court
when
these
cases
are
tried
on
their
merits.
now,
those
matters
will
not
aid
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
superior
court
of
new
castle
county
has
jurisdiction
to
try
these
cases.
when
petitioners
argue
the
merits
of
their
filed
rate
defenses,
they
are
confusing
the
jurisdictional
question
with
the
wholly
unrelated
matter
as
to
what
the
judgment
should
be.
this
court
may
discuss
this
confusion
in
montana-dakota,
which
i
cite
because
it
had
been
cited
by
the
petitioners.
there,
this
court
explained
that
if
the
plaintiffs
complaint
states
the
cause
of
action
which
invokes
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court,
then
the
mere
statement
of
that
claim
invokes
that
jurisdiction
to
determine
whether
the
claim
is
meritorious
or
not.
thus,
the
single
question
here
in
this
appeal
from
an
order
denying
a
writ
of
provision
is
whether
or
not
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction.
this,
i
think,
requires
a
careful
examination
of
the
cases
as
they
pin
below
because
it
is
our
feet
that
this
is
the
critical
test.
the
fatal
weakness
of
petitioners'
position
is
their
refusal
to
deal
with
the
cases
as
they
are.
these
cases
were
not
brought
to
enforce
a
filed
rate.
they
were
not
brought
to
resolve
a
dispute
as
to
what
the
filed
rate
was.
they
were
not
brought
to
collateral
or
to
attack
a
filed
rate.
these
cases
were
brought
to
enforce
common-law
rights,
and
liabilities
which
came
into
being
when
this
court
held
at
the
kansas
minimum
price
order
was
void.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
for
me
to
explain
in
detail
what
the
complaints
alleged
because
they
relate
all
of
the
facts
upon
which
we
rely.
the
complaints
filed
against
each
of
the
petitioners
is
substantially
identical,
restated
in
narrative
form,
they
tell
they
relate
these
facts.
cities
service
gas
company
is
a
natural
gas
company
engaged
in
this
business
as
an
interstate
gas
pipeline
company,
the
petitioners
or
producers
of
natural
gas.
in
1949
and
in
1950,
cities
entered
in
long
term
contracts
for
the
purchase
of
gas
produced
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
from
these
petitioners.
those
contracts
fixed
prices
for
the
purchase
of
the
gas
had
approximately
eight
cents
per
mcf.
after
those
contracts
had
been
being
performed
for
four
and
five
years,
respectively,
the
kansas
corporation
commission
on
december
2nd,
1953
entered
its
minimum
price
order
purporting
to
fix
a
minimum
price
of
eleven-cents
per
mcf
for
all
gas
produced
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
upon
the
entry
of
that
order,
cities
commenced
an
action
to
review
it
challenging
it
as
being
invalid.
after
that
action
had
been
commenced
but
before
cities
made
its
first
payment
in
compliance
with
the
order,
cities
wrote
a
letter
to
each
of
the
petitioners,
the
january
21
letter
to
which
mr.
gray
referred.
in
that
letter,
cities
explained
that
it
had
commenced
an
action
for
the
judicial
review
of
the
validity
of
that
order,
and
that
while
that
litigation
was
pending,
it
would
pay
the
eleven-cent
price
in
compliance
with
the
order.
but
that
those
payments
were
to
be
made
by
cities
and
to
be
accepted
by
the
producers
as
the
involuntary
compliance
with
the
order.
and
the
january
21
letter
conclude,
“in
the
event
the
order
is
finally
judicially
modified
or
declared
to
be
invalid
in
whole
or
in
part,
cities
service
gas
company
will
expect
you
to
refund
to
it
the
amount
of
any
over
payments.”
immediately
upon
receipt
of
that
letter,
the
petitioner
pan
american
answered
in
which
it
restated
the
terms
of
the
letter
generally
as
we
had
stated
it
and
concluded
saying,
“we
will
therefore
accept
the
payments
on
this
basis.”
thereafter,
for
47
months,
cities
made
payments
monthly
for
all
gas
purchase
from
each
of
the
petitioners
by
monthly
check.
and
on
each
of
those
checks,
there
was
subscribed
an
endorsement
in
which
it
was
said
these
payments
are
made
subject
to
the
terms
and
the
conditions
of
the
january
21,
1954
letter.
i
think
that
is
significant
especially
in
view
of
mr.
gray's
suggestion
that
the
payments
were
pursuant
to
a
federal
power
commission
filed
rate
schedule.
in
other
words,
those
payments
by
those
checks
with
that
endorsement
on
them
used
continuously
from
the
first
payment
after
january
1954
until
this
court's
decision
on
january
20,
1958
holding
that
the
kansas
price
order
was
void.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
commencing
first
on
--
as
of
june
7,
1954.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
on
january
1,
1954.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
our
--
my
claim
begins
on
january
1,
1954.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
in
other
words,
we
have
a
six
months
period
in
which
is
there
no
claim
--
no
one
can
claim
that
there
is
any
claim
with
that.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
no,
sir.
the
--
the
controversy
involves
all
the
period
from
january
1,
1954.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
yes.
of
course
--
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
yes.
this
--
there
is
a
single
case
pending
against
each
petitioner.
it
makes
a
claim
for
refund
for
payments
made
during
the
whole
period,
january
1,
1954
through
the
date
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
holding
the
order
void.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
oh,
there
were
no
--
the
defense
is
that
--
are
specifically
to
that
six
months
period.
they
--
collectively,
the
defendants
plead
some
19
separate
misstated
offenses,
and
they
go
to
the
whole
claim,
and
they
include
all
sorts
of
common-law
defenses,
the
statute
of
limitations,
common-law
defense
of
acquiescence
and
estoppel,
voluntary
payments.
they
claim
that
the
contract
for
refund
is
not
supported
for
--
by
a
lack
of
consideration,
those
sort
of
common-law
defenses.
there
are
great
many
of
them.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
after
the
effective
date
of
june
7,
1954.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
of
course,
there's
a
procedure
under
the
natural
scope.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
think
not.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think,
perhaps,
if
the
filed
rate
was
inconsistent
with
the
common-law
claims
that
you
made,
that
it
would
be
a
good
defense,
but
i
--
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
determines
the
--
that
doctrine
determines
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court,
and
i
think
further,
of
course,
that
our
claims
are
meritorious.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
which
i
concede
to
be
a
different
question.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
believe
that
it
does,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
think
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
i
was
in
the
point
of
describing
the
facts
which
are
those
alleged
in
our
complaint.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
on
january
20,
1958.
in
other
words,
on
the
date
of
this
court's
decision,
we
seek
making
payments
under
the
kansas
minimum
price
order.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
after
that,
we
paid
the
contract
price
which
is
approximately
eight
cents.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
none
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
don't
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
they
had
accepted
it
in
full.
they
have
certainly
accepted
the
money.
i
think
they
preserve
the
right
to
continue
to
claim
that
they
get
the
eleven-cents
under
the
kansas
minimum
price.
this
brings
us
--
of
course,
having
explained
how
the
payments
were
made
to
the
decision
of
this
court
rendered
on
january
20,
1958
in
which
this
court
held
that
the
kansas
order
was
void.
and
also
brings
us
past
to
the
point
that
we,
thereupon,
seize
making
payments
at
the
eleven-cent
price
and
made
a
demand
upon
each
petitioner
for
a
refund
of
the
difference
between
the
amounts
of
money
which
we
had
paid
them
under
the
void
order
and
the
amounts
which
we're
dealing
under
the
contract
price.
upon
their
refusal
to
make
those
demanded
refunds,
we
commenced
these
actions
in
the
delaware
state
court,
making
allegations
which
related
in
more
formal
terms
exacts
the
exact
statement
of
facts,
as
i
have
made.
the
concluding
paragraph
in
each
complaint
set
forth
cities
three
alternative
common-law
theories
of
recovery.
we
claim
that
there
was
a
contract
to
refund
made
by
the
january
21,
1954
letter
and
the
acceptance
of
payments
made
subject
to.
and
then,
of
course,
in
the
case
of
pan
american,
who
had
answered
our
letter,
we
included
the
claim
that
that
answer
we
will,
therefore,
agree
to
accept
payments
on
this
basis
made
a
written
contract
to
refund.
the
second
theory
of
our
recovery
was
the
theory
--
the
common-law
doctrine
of
restitution
for
--
of
moneys
which
had
been
paid
under
a
judgment
or
an
order
which
is
later
reversed.
and
the
third
was
the
common-law
doctrine
of
unadjusted
ratio.
now,
those
are
the
complaints
as
they
were
alleged.
the
petitioners'
answers,
as
i
previously
suggested,
included
some
19
separately
stated
defenses.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
oh,
there
was
no
allegation
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
none
whatsoever.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
the
--
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
we
had
a
great
deal
of
help.
the
fifth
circuit
had
recently
decided
natural
gas
pipeline
company
of
america
versus
harrington
which
involved
refund
to
payments
under
the
oklahoma
order,
and
we
had
a
pretty
good
guide
as
to
the
cause
of
action
which
could
be
sustained.
we
follow
that
as
precisely
as
it
could.
as
has
been
suggested,
the
natural
gas
act
got
into
this
case
wholly
by
way
of
defense.
texaco
pleaded
it
and
their
fifth
separate
defense.
there,
they
alleged
that
they
had
an
eleven-cent
filed
rate
because
of
the
effect
of
the
kansas
minimum
price
order
and
of
their
filing
of
a
copy
of
it.
and
pan
american
as
its
third
separate
defense,
claim
that
the
cities'
recovery
was
barred
because
they
had
a
filed
rate
of
eleven-cents
on
--
because
they
had
filed
a
copy
of
the
minimum
price
order.
i
think
that
it
would
be
well
to
mention
the
amendment
because
as
i
understand
that
is
the
single
claim
which
the
petitioners
make
here
that
that
changed
it
all
the
effect
of
our
common-law
causes
of
action.
of
course,
it
is
perfect
obviously
from
an
examination
of
the
amendment
in
which
we
allege
that
this
was
interstate
gas.
we
were
simply
coming
within
the
terms
of
this
court's
judgment
holding
that
the
kansas
minimum
price
order
was
void
as
to
such
things.
there
is
the
suggestion
in
the
briefs,
it
has
not
been
mentioned
or
laid
back
in
some
way
cities'
answer
briefs
in
response
to
petitioners'
briefs
in
support
of
motions
for
summary
judgment
in
some
way
changed
our
common-law
causes
of
action.
i
think
a
brief
examination
of
those
briefs
and
the
setting
in
which
they
were
filed
will
dispel
any
feeling
with
respect
to
that.
you
understand
that
the
petitioners'
filed
motions
for
summary
judgment
which
were
not
directed
at
the
jurisdictional
issue
at
all,
but
simply
claim
that
there
filed
rates
were
good
defenses.
we
responded,
they
then
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
those
motions
for
summary
judgment
relying
upon
the
doctrine
of
montana-dakota
that
there
could
be
deviation
for
--
from
the
filed
rate,
and
that
therefore,
the
filed
rate
was
going
to
be
a
meritorious
defense.
we
responded,
of
course,
by
recognizing
this
court's
decision
in
montana-dakota
but
pointing
out
that
our
common-law
causes
of
action,
which
we
had
asserted,
were
perfectly
consistent
with
and
perfectly
compatible
with
the
petitioners'
filed
rate.
now,
this,
i
think,
fully
describes
the
cases
as
they
now
end
in
the
delaware
superior
court
and
to
which
the
petitioners
would
have
this
court
apply
the
provisions
of
section
22
of
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
only
--
i
don't
think
it
prejudged
it,
except
to
the
extent
that
they
--
that
the
delaware
trial
court
has
overruled
there
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
did
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
oh,
no,
i
don't
--
i
do
not
understand
that
completely.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
no,
i
think
what
the
delaware
court
did
hold
has
had
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
third
circuit
was
that
the
kansas
minimum
price
order,
because
this
court
had
held
it
was
void
that
that
order
was
a
nullity
whether
it
was
filed
in
the
files
of
the
federal
power
commission
or
--
or
not.
i
think
that
--
that
is
the
holding.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
well
--
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
oh,
i
--
the
delaware
trial
court
has
overruled
the
petitioners'
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
in
doing
so,
they
have
held
that
the
kansas
minimum
price
order,
in
their
view,
is
a
nullity
whether
filed
or
not.
now,
of
course,
the
order
overruling
the
motion
for
new
--
for
summary
judgment
is
not
an
appealable
order,
either
under
the
delaware
practice
or
in
the
federal
courts.
and
so
that
ruling
--
there
has
never
been
an
order
of
any
court
which
decided
that
in
a
posture
from
which
there
could
be
taken
an
appeal.
that
--
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
not
--
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
that's
right.
it's
not
here.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
that's
right.
i
would
not
like
to
leave
this
evening
without
making
particular
the
point
that
in
my
argument
tomorrow,
i
will
show
that
petitioners
do
not
have
a
good
defense
of
this
case
when
it
is
tried
on
its
merits.
and
that
petitioners
filed
rates
are
the
contract
rates,
wholly
unaffected
and
unmodified
by
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
well,
i
don't
think
--
the
only
reason
it's
significant
at
all
is
because
they
make
the
argument
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
well,
of
course,
i
--
has
state
the
hazard
to
(inaudible)
i
was
wrong
in
it
being
irrelevant.[laughter]
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
they
are
meshed
except
as
--
as
the
petitioners'
seek
to
enmeshed
them
by
--
by
our
view
of
jurisdictional
questions
with
the
others.
i
think
they
are
clearly
set
forth.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
yes.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
--
whether
--
whether
--
i
don't
think
i
have
to
show
that
i
am
going
to
win
in
the
delaware
superior
court
for
the
delaware
superior
court
to
have
jurisdiction
over
my
case.
mr.
charles
v.
wheeler
that's
correct,
sir.
i
take
it
that
it's
recess
time,
your
honor.
