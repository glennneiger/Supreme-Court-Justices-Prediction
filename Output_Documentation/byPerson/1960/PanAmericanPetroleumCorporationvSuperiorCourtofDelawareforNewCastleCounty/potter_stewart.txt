mr.
schlicher,
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
the
outset,
you
don't
need
to
answer
this
question
now,
just
sometime
later
or
in
rebuttal,
but
this
case
basically
is
--
put
in
the
simplest
terms,
is
one
of
jurisdiction,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
courts
of
delaware
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
entertain
this
lawsuit.
you're
claiming
that
the
state
courts
have
no
such
jurisdictions.
is
it
your
position
that
the
--
that
therefore
the
respondents
are
--
have
no
remedy
anywhere
or
do
you
suggest
that
somewhere
in
the
federal
court
or
in
the
--
or
in
the
federal
power
commission
in
this
case
with
this
alleged
claim
that
they
have
if
they
have
a
remedy
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
had.
justice
potter
stewart
nowhere
because
they
--
as
you
began
you
said
the
--
this
is
the
matter
of
all
of
which
the
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
but
--
but,
of
course,
the
federal
courts
do,
but
this
--
now,
the
federal
courts
don't,
because
of
what,
of
limitations
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
took
time
in
any
event.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
the
point
of
saying
that
this
was
a
47-month
period
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
which
you
are
suing
beginning
january
1st,
1954
and
ending,
when?
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
and
then
--
and
then
what
did
you
pay
thereafter?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
pay
eleven-cents,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wheeler,
on
the
basis
of
what
you
told
us
as
to
the
statement
of
the
case,
do
you
think
it
will
still
be
--
that
--
that
the
--
that
the
petitioners
will
still
be
completely
free
in
the
delaware
courts
to
raise
the
defense
of
the
filed
rate
on
the
merits?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
delaware
court,
do
you
think
the
delaware
court
is
prejudged
or
judged
that
issue
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
didn't
it
go
--
in
doing
so
didn't
at
least
one
of
the
courts
say
that
they
could
just
disregard
the
filed
rate?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
there
were
nullity
or
whatever
they're
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
might
--
yes.
that
might
give
you
a
ground
for
asking
us
to
grant
certiorari.
but
my
only
question
is,
how
did
they
pass
on
that
already?
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
they
said
it's
not
a
good
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
a
matter
of
jurisdiction
before
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
a
writ
of
prohibition,
and
that's
all
there
could
be
there?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
--
why
do
we
have
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
fact
is
you
began
by
saying
there
are
two
separate
problems
and
of
course,
there
are
ones
in
jurisdiction
and
the
--
of
the
state
court,
the
other
is
in
the
merits
but
they
are
not,
as
you
suggested,
as
they
often
or
not
completely
separated.
they
are
somewhat
in
meshed,
aren't
they,
here,
in
these
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
can
be
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
mr.
gray,
the
gully
case,
as
i
understand
it,
had
to
do
--
the
question
there
was
whether
something
was
properly
in
the
--
permissibly
in
the
state
court
or
whether
it
should
have
been
exclusively
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
--
in
this
case,
you
don't
make
that
claim
at
all.
you
don't
say
that
these
people
could
properly
be
in
the
district
court.
you
say
they
can't
be
in
any
court
at
all
that
they
have
nowhere
where
they
can
assert
their
right
(voice
