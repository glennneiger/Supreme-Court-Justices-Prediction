were
you
actually
given
notice?
justice
john

that's
from
your
--
from
the
sellers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
the
--
from
the
period
of
the
filing
in
1954
to
the
panoma
case
decision,
you
were
paying
at
eleven-cent
rate,
were
you
not?
justice

as
you'd

and
subject
to

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
following
the
panoma
case,
will
the
commission
have
had
any
power
or
jurisdiction
to
require
the
reimbursement
to
you
of
the
overpayments,
the
difference
between
eleven
cents
and
the
8.4
cents
or
whatever
it
was?
could
you
have
brought
a
suit
in
the
commission
or
a
proceeding
before
the
commission,
assuming
that
pan
american
had
not
been
willing
to
reimburse,
could
you
have
brought
a
proceeding
in
the
commission
to
require
that
reimbursement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
never
understood
this
commission
had
any
past
reparation
power
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
can
fix
a
rate
only
for
the
future.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
pinpoint
that
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
they
continued
to
pay
under
protest,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
to
mr.
wheeler's
argument
that
all
this,
which
followed
panoma
was
simply
to
show
to
the
state
court
that
his
rights,
asserted
rights
under
his
contract,
cities
rights
under
his
contract
was
not
inconsistent
with
anything
that
the
power
commission
would
be
interested
in?
justice
