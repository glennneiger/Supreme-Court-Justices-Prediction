mr.
richard
j.
burke
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
speaking
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
lucchese
and
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
that
if
the
costello
case
is
decided
adversely
to
costello,
then
the
question
involved
in
the
lucchese
case
becomes
entirely
academic
because
the
question
involved
in
the
lucchese
case
has
only
to
do
ultimately
with
whether
the
district
court
obeyed
this
court's
mandates
or
not
when
it
entered
its
order
of
dismissal.
i
would
like
to
initially
answer
justice
stewart's
question
about
the
ringhiser
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
because
that
has
to
do
with
the
first
point
that
i
want
to
discuss
and
there
the
district
court
purporting
to
obey
a
supreme
court
mandate
had
entered
an
order
unsatisfactory
to
one
of
the
parties
and
the
party
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
appeal
stating
specifically
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
of
the
question
whether
a
district
court
has
or
has
not
complied
with
the
supreme
court
mandate
and
that
is
entirely
a
question
for
this
court
to
determine
and
a
party
complaining
that
the
district
court
is
not
complying
with
this
court's
mandate
must
come
to
this
court.
and
the
basis
and
authority
for
that
proposition
is
not
only
in
court
of
appeals
cases
but
in
this
court
and
i
have
cited
the
case
in
my
brief.
it's
in
207
united
states.
it
had
to
do
where
the
case
where
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
assumed
the
power
to
determine
whether
a
district
court
was
complying
or
not
with
the
mandate
and
this
court
there
stated
and
i've
quoted
the
language
in
my
brief
"the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
of
the
matter."
so,
words
couldn't
be
clearer
it
seems
to
me
and
therefore
when
the
government
--
mr.
richard
j.
burke
that
case
is
entitled
ex
parte
first
national
bank
of
chicago
your
honor.
i
have
cited
that
at
page
5
of
my
brief.
therefore
--
mr.
richard
j.
burke
correct,
exactly.
and
--
mr.
richard
j.
burke
i
say
no,
your
honor
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
judgment.
the
district
court
was
acting
in
a
ministerial
capacity
the
cases
say,
in
entering
an
order
in
compliance
with
this
court
to
mandate
and
had
nothing
to
do
but
follow
what
this
court
directed
it
to
do.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
it
would
have
to
use
its
best
the
judgment
as
to
whether
it
were
--
whether
it
was
obeying
what
this
court
had
directed
to
be
done.
that's
what
both
these
district
courts
did
in
this
case
and
in
the
costello
case.
since
this
court's
judgment
said
nothing
about
the
dismissal
being
without
prejudice
to
a
government's
right
to
bring
a
new
action
thereafter,
but
simply
said
it
is
remanded
with
directions
to
dismiss.
both
district
courts
felt
that
they
should
follow
the
unambiguous
direction
of
this
court
and
enter
an
order
dismissing
this
what
the
effect
of
such
an
order
would
be
if
it's
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
determine,
but
both
courts
felt
to
add
to
what
this
court
had
directed
the
words
without
prejudice
to
the
government's
right
to
start
a
new
action
would
be
to
vary
the
judgment
that
this
court
had
entered.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
yes.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
well,
that
particular
distinction
has
not
been
taken
to
my
knowledge,
justice
frankfurter.
the
distinction
has
been
taken,
but
if
a
completely
new
issue
is
raised
before
the
district
court
which
doesn't
involve
the
question
of
compliance
with
this
court's
judgment
but
then
that
can
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
that
i
feel
is
not
involved
here
and
so
did
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
well
in
its
briefs,
the
government
here
has
taken
both
positions
i'd
say
inconsistently
but
it's
argued
both
ways.
it
has
said
primarily
that
it
was
implied
in
this
court's
judgment
that
the
dismissal
should
be
without
prejudice
to
a
further
proceeding.
and
then
it
has
said
conversely
that
if
it
was
not
implied,
then
it
was
a
brand
new
matter
and
the
district
court
could
take
it
up
as
a
new
manner
without
feeling
that
it
was
under
any
control,
one
way
or
another
in
this
court
automatically.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
i
think
that
--
mr.
richard
j.
burke
well,
oddly
enough
the
government
maintains
that
it
was
so
clearer
that
the
district
court
should
have
added
these
words
whereas
i
maintain
and
the
district
court,
both
district
courts
in
both
cases
and
also
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
felt
that
it
was
just
as
clear
the
other
way
that
they
had
no
business
to
add
any
such
words
to
what
is
in
directive
to
this
court.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
that's
right.
in
the
--
in
the
lucchese
case,
they
said
that
one
doesn't
reach
the
question
of
the
effect
of
the
order.
they
simply
--
mr.
richard
j.
burke
that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
that
is
for
another
day
and
the
other
day
came
at
--
the
other
day
came
a
couple
of
weeks
later
in
costello
and
they
decided
that
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
words
were
in
there
or
not,
a
different
panel
of
the
same
court.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
no
there
has
not
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
and
they
have
not
done
that.
instead,
they
have
become
concerned
about
the
form
of
the
judgment,
but
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
government
in
the
relief
that
is
asking
this
court
for
ignores
the
procedural
posture
in
which
the
lucchese
case
is
here,
because
i
moved
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
their
appeal
on
the
ground
that
i
have
discussed
a
few
moments
ago
that
they
lacked
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
question
at
all
and
they
granted
my
motion
and
entered
an
order
which
is
in
the
record
in
which
it
states
that
a
motion
having
been
made
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
is
granted.
then
they
added
what
i
have
maintained
as
a
dictum
the
words
that
in
any
event
the
district
court,
they
don't
say
in
any
event.
they
said
the
district
court
had
no
basis
to
take
any
other
action
then
it
did
and
we
will
not
pass
now
upon
possible
effect
of
that
on
future
litigation,
but
what
i
say
is
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
intended
to
consider
this
question
on
the
merits
as
to
whether
the
district
court
should
or
should
not
enter
an
order
without
prejudice
in
cases
like
this
or
in
this
case,
i
would
assume
that
it
would
have
had
a
full
dress
argument
and
appeal
on
the
matter
rather
than
dismissing
it
on
my
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
it
is
what
they
did
and
what
the
government
is
here
reviewing
by
certiorari
is
whether
a
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
was
correct
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
they're
asking
for
the
relief
that
you
direct
the
district
court
to
add
the
words
without
prejudice
to
the
order
in
the
lucchese
case.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
that
is
--
that
is
one
ground
that
i'm
standing
on.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
but
--
but,
not
only
on
that
ground.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
because
--
and
i
--
and
i
finished
speaking
of
that
ground
getting
down.
if
this
court
will
--
intends
to
consider
or
does
consider
the
question
about
whether
to
issue
directions
to
the
district
court
and
what
sort
of
an
order
the
district
court
should
have
entered
whether
it
did
or
did
not
comply
with
this
court's
judgment
and
i
want
to
discuss
that
question.
of
course
i
feel
as
the
--
as
the
court
of
appeals
commented
in
its
opinion
and
as
both
district
judges
felt,
that
they
had
no
business
adding
words
to
what
this
court
had
directed,
but
the
government
says
that
it
was
implied
in
this
court's
judgment
that
these
words
without
prejudice
to
refer
the
proceeding
should
be
added
to
the
order.
and,
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
no
matter
what
else
one
may
say
that
no
such
thing
was
implied
in
this
court's
judgment.
this
court,
if
it
had
--
if
it
had
adverted
to
that
question
and
meant
to
either
imply
it
or
expressly
say
it
could
well
have
said
in
lucchese
that
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
which
was
adverse
to
lucchese
is
reversed
and
the
district
court's
order
is
reinstated
because
the
original
district
court's
order
in
lucchese
had
been
without
prejudice
to
a
further
proceeding
by
the
government.
but
instead
of
simply
reinstating
the
district
court's
order
that
this
court
specifically
said
it's
remanded
to
the
district
court
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
and
stopped
there.
so
that
i
don't
see
how
any
district
court
would
imply
or
would
think
that
it
was
implied
in
that
statement
that
they
should
simply
put
back
into
effect
their
original
order,
this
court
not
having
told
them
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
it's
cited
at
zucca
and
there
is
nothing
in
zucca,
contrary
to
what
the
counsel
says.
i
believe
to
indicate
that
this
court
meant
to
hold
in
zucca
that
the
government
would
have
a
right
to
start
another
action
after
the
dismissal.
the
point
was
really
not
passed
on
at
all
in
zucca.
that
wasn't
before
the
court
in
zucca
as
to
what
sort
of
a
dismissal
would
be
had.
the
only
point
in
zucca
was
whether
the
government
had
to
file
the
affidavit
or
not.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
well,
the
language
that
was
used
in
zucca
was
a
procedural
prerequisite,
but
i
don't
reach
the
point
your
honor
as
to
whether
it's
the
jurisdictional
under
rule
41
and
so
on.
i
don't
believe
i
reach
that
point
lucchese
that
it's
necessary
for
me
to
reach
that
point
because
all
the
--
all
the
district
courts
had
to
determine
was
whether
it
was
necessarily
implied
in
this
court's
order
that
it
should
add
these
words
without
prejudice.
if
it
were
--
if
it
were
jurisdictional
under
rule
41,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
adding
the
words
without
prejudice
because
it
would
be
without
prejudice
anyway
under
the
rule.
so
there
was
no
way
that
the
district
court
could
feel
that
there
was
an
applied
direction
to
add
without
prejudice.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
that's
right
and
if
i
may
just
add
one
sentence.
what
the
government
is
actually
doing
here
under
the
guise
of
review
by
certiorari
is
trying
to
get
a
belated
petition
for
rehearing
of
that
judgment
that
was
originally
entered
two
years
ago
by
this
court
because
they
end
up
their
reply
brief
by
asking
this
court
to
clarify
its
judgment,
if
that
be
necessary
and
i
say
i
already
had
time
on
that.
mr.
richard
j.
burke
we
probably
went
to
it
in
the
wrong
order,
i
agree.
