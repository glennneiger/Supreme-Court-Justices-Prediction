justice
potter
stewart
mr.
barnett,
it's
a
little
complicated
procedure
to
follow.
the
basic
issue
is
simply
not
i
expected
sure
enough.
what
was
the
chronology
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit?
did
the
costello
appeal
get
there
ahead
of
the
lucchese
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
before?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
do
with
the
ringhiser
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
got
the
right
the
name
--
the
right
name
of
the
act,
(inaudible)
in
that
case
in
which
there
was
some
confusion
or
uncertainty
as
to
what
the
mandate
was
that
this
court
meant?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
as
it
appears,
there
hasn't
been
a
new
complaint,
but
it's
actually
in
relation
with
the
lucchese
case.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
williams
at
that
time
could
the
action
have
been
instituted
under
the
1940
act
after
the
enactment
of
the
1952
act?
justice
potter
stewart
because
he
only
gave
40
statute
had
been
amended
and
those
stipulations
of
the
petitioner
are
going
to
change
the
--
or
all
the
amendment
by
act
of
congress,
was
it?
