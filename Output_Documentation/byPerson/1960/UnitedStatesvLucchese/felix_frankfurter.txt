justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
burke,
do
you
think
a
distinction
of
the
cases
you
have
cite
like
this,
you
say
that
the
ministerial
duties
of
the
court
--
the
district
court
involves
that.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
suppose
that
there
is
no
discretion
as
(inaudible)
if
it's
clear
as
day.
if
that
is
so,
if
it
has
failed
to
exercise
its
ministerial
duties,
they're
not
(inaudible)
the
court
of
appeals
of
proper
court
to
resort
(inaudible).
if
there
is
doubt
with
real
ambiguity
as
to
what
the
judgment
of
this
court
talks
about.
and
therefore
it
is
not
reducible
to
a
ministerial
act
then
i
should
think
the
proper
place
to
come
to
it
here
as
this
court,
and
ask
what
does
your
mandate
mean?
is
that
distinction
--
is
there
any
validity
to
that
distinction
as
it's
been
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
really
not,
really
not.
that
is
not
--
it
isn't
new
method.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
something
that
this
court
has
left
open
and
it
isn't
a
question
of
construing
--
unless
that
be
an
issue,
unless
it
is
a
question
whether
it
was
left
open
and
i
should
think
the
proper
thing
to
do
it
to
come
in
and
to
put
the
matter
to
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
of
that
amount
where
there's
space
that
i
wrote
almost
one
of
my
very
rare
(inaudible)
which
involved
this
discretion,
namely,
as
to
what
was
left
open
whether
it
was
a
new
matter
and
that's
a
very
different
and
if
that
in
controversy,
then
i
should
think
you
have
to
come
in,
you
have
to
come
here
and
ask
the
court
what
does
your
mandate
means?
i
think
you
need
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
so
clear
that
there's
no
dispute
if
it
is
merely
--
it's
â€“
if
it
is
contented
by
the
government
that
zucca
established
one
loosely
might
be
called
a
jurisdictional
requirement
namely
necessary
precondition
to
a
suit
and
therefore
it
couldn't
be
that
we
--
when
we
send
the
case
down
that
you
can't
begin
this
relief
so
you
now
can
qualify
--
can
qualify
within
the
requirements
that
constitutes
the
suit.
but
it's
strictly
a
territory,
i
must
say
whether
it's
so
clear
that
it's
become
ministerial
or
whether
the
petition
question
that
you
must
ask
a
court
that
made
to
do
(inaudible)
that
is
what
it's
meant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
understand
the
per
curiam
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
simply
said
that
if
the
district
court
uses
the
words
that
this
court
has
been
using,
it
is
obeying
the
mandate,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
for
another
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
district
court
did
exactly
what
they
did
(inaudible)
to
issue
its
mandate.
what
the
legal
consequences
are
that
for
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
guess
we
better
decide
costello.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
standing
on
the
dismissal
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
defending
it
on
the
ground
that
it
should
have
come
here?
if
not,
you
can
defend
it
on
that
ground
couldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
all
events,
well
in
all
events,
you
just
said
that
either
it's
necessarily
implied
and
we
had
to
spell
it
out,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
lawsuit
to
put
in
words
that
are
very
implicitly
or
if
--
if
that's
in
doubt
all
the
government
has
to
do
it
is
to
file
a
piece
of
paper,
we
will
find
out
after
finding
it
whether
it
is
any
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
glad
(inaudible)
both
of
you,
but
physically
say
now,
you
shouldn't
have
heard
this
case
but
held
at
costello.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
said
it
came
after
it
was
stricken
that
stating
what
--
that
stating
the
actual
difference
in
--
without
prejudice
in
the
absence
of
prejudice
but
i
think
the
direct
(inaudible)
that
this
court
(inaudible)
without
prejudice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
our
mandate
didn't
mention
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
whole
prejudice,
the
whole
substantive
question
is
what
the
implication
of
that
that
neutral
of
that
(inaudible)
too
much,
but
the
question
is
what
single
significant
is
the
attachment
to
our
mandate
which
didn't
(inaudible)
dismissed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
accept
your
suggestion
if
you
can
speculate
one
way
or
the
other
while
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
just
have
to
take
the
word
and
draw
appropriate
legal
significant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
what
appears
in
the
technical
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
costello
issue
may
--
the
problem
in
the
costello
case
maybe
disposed
off
on
grounds
that
do
not
reach
the
so
called
merits
of
this
case,
namely,
the
fact
that
sufficient
reason
would
not
be
necessary
to
raise
the
question
on
the
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
costello.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
part
of
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
sure
i
was
granted
and
go
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
think
it's
the
consummate
term
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
(inaudible)
