mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
adjourned
on
friday
last,
the
court
was
considering
the
fact
and
the
effect
of
an
order
of
dismissal
entered
by
the
lower
court
pursuant
to
what
it
regarded
as
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
these
companion
cases.
my
understanding
of
the
position
articulated
by
counsel
for
the
government
on
thursday
is
that
in
as
much
as
the
court
is
reviewing
this
question
in
the
lucchese
case,
the
government
does
not
now
object
to
its
being
reviewed
in
the
companion
case
and
therefore,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
with
the
court's
indulgence
to
the
merits
of
the
question.
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
a
suit
was
instituted
against
the
petitioner
in
1952
under
the
nationality
act
of
1940,
charging
that
he
had
procured
his
citizenship
in
1925,
fraudulently
and
illegally.
that
case
came
on
for
trial
in
1956,
and
as
the
government
offered
its
proof,
it
became
apparent
that
its
evidence
was
lethally
infected
by
wiretapping.
it
became
evident
that
the
source
material
on
which
the
affidavit
of
"good
cause"
had
been
based
was
equally
infected
with
wiretapped
information.
and
so
the
trial
judge
entered
a
dismissal
of
that
action
for
the
reason
that
the
government
was
not
able
to
extricate
the
evidence
which
was
predicated
on
wiretapping
from
that
which
was
not.
the
trial
judge
entered
a
dismissal
without
prejudice
and
very
carefully,
if
the
court
please,
enunciated
what
he
meant
by
that.
the
case
is
dismissed
without
prejudice
to
the
government
initiating
it
anew
on
the
very
same
grounds
an
order
to
that
effect
is
filed
herewith.
and
the
trial
judge,
if
the
court
please,
went
to
the
pains
of
extracting
a
stipulation
from
the
petitioner
agreeing
that
the
savings
clause
of
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
was
by
that
time
in
effect,
would
be
operative
insofar
as
the
new
proceedings
were
concerned,
thereby,
making
sure
that
the
government's
rights
to
initiate
this
action
under
the
old
nationality
act
of
1940
were
preserved,
showing
what
he
meant
when
he
said
the
government
has
the
right
to
initiate
this
case
on
exactly
the
same
grounds.
but
the
government
didn't
choose
to
exercise
the
right
which
it
was
given
in
the
order
of
dismissal.
rather
it
appealed
to
the
second
circuit,
and
the
second
circuit
reversed
on
the
ground
that
some
of
the
wiretapping
had
antedated
federal
communications
act
of
1934
and
that
of
it
which
did
not
antedate
the
federal
communications
act
of
1934,
was
state
wiretapping
and
there
was
nothing
to
inhibit
the
use
of
state
wiretapped
information
in
federal
courts.
needless
to
say,
this
was
before
the
benanti
case
came
out
of
this
court.
a
petition
was
filed
and
as
has
been
indicated
previously
in
the
argument
of
this
matter,
a
per
curiam
order
came
out
of
this
court
on
april
7,
1958,
and
this
court
ordered
the
action
dismissed
because
the
government
had
failed
to
file
an
affidavit
of
"good
cause"
contemporaneously
with
the
filling
of
the
complaint
in
the
contravention
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
zucca.
on
may
1,
if
the
court
please,
for
reasons
sufficient
unto
the
government,
a
new
action
was
instituted
against
this
petitioner,
not
under
the
1940
act
in
accordance
with
the
order
of
the
trial
judge,
judge
palmieri,
but
under
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act
which
was
by
then
in
effect.
it
was
in
that
context
that
the
mandate
of
this
court
was
presented
to
the
lower
court.
and
so
on
may
31,
1958,
with
a
new
action
in
existence
against
this
petitioner
on
the
new
grounds
provided
for
in
the
nationality
act
of
1952,
the
trial
judge
entered
an
order
of
dismissal.
and
i
think
that
the
requirements
of
total
candor
indicate
that
i
should
say
to
this
court
that
when
the
order
came
out
on
april
7,
1958,
i
believed
as
i
read
that
order,
that
the
government
had
the
right
preserved
for
it,
by
the
lower
court,
judge
palmieri,
to
reinstitute
the
case
under
the
1940
act
but
they
didn't
do
that.
and
insofar
as
the
record
shows
since
we
don't
have
the
ability
to
x-ray
the
mind
of
the
lower
court
judge,
that
dismissal
may
have
been
entered
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
order
of
the
court
below,
namely,
institute
the
new
action
on
the
very
same
grounds
as
it
had
been
theretofore
instant
--
instituted
with
an
affidavit
of
"good
cause"
based
upon
source
material
not
fatally
infected
by
wire
tapping.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
by
virtue,
if
the
court
please,
of
the
stipulation
entered
into
in
the
old
case
by
the
petitioner
certainly
he
had
waved
any
rights
to
object
to
the
1940
act
being
used
because
that
case
was
continued
in
force
and
effect
because
a
final
order
had
not
been
entered
and
so
the
government
could
have
gone
forward
under
that
stipulation,
under
the
1940
act
but
it
shows
not
so
to
do.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
1952
act,
if
the
court
please,
in
its
savings
clause
provided
that
any
proceedings
which
were
in
effect
could
be
preserved.
in
other
words,
it
did
not
terminate
with
litigation
that
was
in
mid
flight
at
that
time
and
what
the
petitioner
did
when
he
stipulated
was
to
say,
this
case
may
go
on
because
the
order
which
was
entered
by
the
lower
court
was
an
order
without
prejudice
for
renewal.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
was
a
dismissal
without
prejudice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
dismissed,
if
the
court
please,
on
the
ground
as
i
previously
indicated
that
there
was
infected
evidence
being
offered
by
the
government
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
forward
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge
had
an
alternative
of
giving
the
court
--
the
government
an
adjournment
of
a
month
in
order
to
clean
up
its
evidence.
but
in
lieu
of
that,
it
took
an
alternative
and
dismissed
without
prejudice
giving
them
the
right
to
file
a
new
affidavit
and
a
new
suit.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
think
the
dismissal
mr.
justice
brennan,
must
be
looked
at
in
its
frame
of
reference,
and
the
dismissal
incorporated
the
stipulation
showing
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
lower
court
not
to
terminate
that
action
with
a
finality
but
to
keep
it
alive
by
virtue
of
the
petitioner's
agreement
that
the
same
proceedings
might
be
instituted
and
therefore,
i
think
that
the
action
was
kept
alive
within
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
1952
savings
clause.
but
in
any
event,
when
the
mandate
of
this
court
came
back
to
the
lower
court,
a
dismissal
was
entered.
the
words
without
prejudice
were
stricken.
the
order
was
presented
with
the
words
"without
prejudice"
the
lower
court
struck
those
words
and
the
government
did
not
see
fit
to
appeal
from
that
order.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
the
lower
court
struck
out
without
prejudice
so
this
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
your
--
the
mandate
of
this
court
did
not
mention
without
prejudice.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
of
course,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
was
an
intervening
factor
between
the
order
of
this
court
and
the
order
entered
pursuant
to
the
mandate
which
certainly
may
have
influenced
the
trial
judge
in
entering
a
final
order
of
dismissal
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
what
appears
from
the
surrounding
records
that
we
have
in
the
framework
of
reference
in
which
he
had
signed
the
order.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
was
â€“
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
it
was
instituted
on
may
1,
1958.
this
court's
order
was
entered
on
april
7,
1958.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
but
the
mandate
was
not
presented
to
the
lower
court
until
may
31,
1958,
31
days
after
the
institution
of
the
new
action.
and
so
at
the
time
that
the
lower
court
was
presented
with
a
mandate
of
this
court,
he
had
a
intervening
act
between
the
order
of
this
court
and
the
presentation
of
the
mandate
which
i
say
may
have
influenced
him,
i
don't
know.
but
in
any
event,
the
government
confronted
with
an
order
of
dismissal
entered
over
its
objection
did
not
appeal,
and
the
rule
seems
to
me
to
be
very
clear
that
where
an
order
of
dismissal
does
not
otherwise
specify
and
is
not
entered
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
lack
of
venue,
it
constitutes
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
mr.
justice
whittaker
addressed
the
question
on
friday,
on
thursday
to
counsel
for
the
government
and
counsel
for
the
other
petitioner
or
the
respondent
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
could
not
have
been
conceived
to
be
a
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
no
court,
to
my
knowledge,
if
the
court
please,
has
ever
conceived
or
stated
that
the
failure
to
file
an
affidavit
of
"good
cause"
was
jurisdiction.
in
the
schwinn
case,
which
antedated
the
zucca
case
here,
the
question
had
been
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
affidavit
of
"good
cause"
had
not
been
contemporaneously
filed
and
that
this
was
a
reason
for
this
hearing
in
the
proceedings
below.
this
court
was
not
confronted
with
that
question
although
the
record
clearly
showed
that
the
affidavit
had
not
been
filed
and
this
court
affirmed
the
judgement
of
the
lower
court,
although
it
might
sua
sponte
have
noted
the
jurisdictional
question.
in
the
zucca
case,
this
court
refrained
from
saying
that
the
affidavit
of
"good
cause",
if
not
filed
constituted
the
jurisdictional
bar.
rather
it
said
that
the
filing
of
the
affidavit
of
"good
cause"
is
a
procedural
prerequisite.
but
in
any
event,
in
the
case
here
--
for
petitioner
costello,
it
is
not
clear
that
the
entry
of
the
order
by
the
lower
court
did
not
relate
to
the
intervening
act
namely
the
filing
of
the
new
suit
by
the
government
under
the
1952
statute.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
thirty-one
days
prior,
sir.
yes,
sir,
thirty-one
days
prior.
and
so
i
think
that
it
can
be
argued
reasonably
that
what
he
did
was
entirely
in
accordance
with
what
was
proper
because
the
government
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
order
of
the
court
namely
to
institute
the
new
proceeding
on
precisely
the
same
grounds
as
the
old
under
the
1940
act.
