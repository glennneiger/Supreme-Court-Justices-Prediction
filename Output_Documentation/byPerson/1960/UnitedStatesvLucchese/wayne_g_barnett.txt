mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
actually
two
cases
and
they
are
consolidated
for
argument.
the
lucchese
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari,
but
also
the
costello
case
number
59
is
being
argued
with
lucchese
on
one
question
that
that
question
that
was
raised
by
the
motion
for
leave
to
amend
the
petition
in
costello.
in
the
1955
term,
this
court
held
in
united
states
v.
zucca
that
a
denaturalization
proceeding
could
not
be
maintained
without
filing
in
court
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
required
by
section
340
(a)
of
the
immigration
act.
these
cases
arise
from
the
government's
attempt
to
comply
with
those
requirements.
in
both
of
these
cases
as
in
zucca,
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
was
not
filed
with
the
original
complaint.
after
the
zucca
decision
however,
the
government
did
file
affidavits
in
attempt
to
cure
the
original
defect.
the
second
circuit
in
both
cases
held
that
that
late
filing
was
adequate.
this
court,
however,
granted
certiorari
and
in
per
curiam
orders,
reversed
the
judgments
and
remanded
the
cases
with
directions
to
dismiss
the
complaints
saying
and
the
order
appears
in
new
lucchese
at
page
29
an
affidavit
showing
good
cause
as
a
prerequisite
to
the
initiation
of
the
denaturalization
proceedings.
the
affidavit
must
be
filed
with
the
complaint
when
the
proceedings
are
instituted.
on
remand
of
the
--
of
these
two
cases
to
the
district
courts,
lucchese
to
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
and
costello
to
the
southern
district,
the
government
submitted
proposed
judgments
dismissing
the
complaints
without
prejudice.
the
district
courts
in
each
case,
however,
felt
that
they
were
bound
by
this
court's
mandate
simply
to
dismiss
without
specifying
the
effect
of
the
dismissal
orders
and
the
order
in
lucchese
is
in
the
record
at
page
30
and
31.
the
dismissal
order
in
costello
is
not
printed
in
the
record,
but
we
are
--
by
stipulation
filed
copies
which
i
believe
were
distributed
to
the
court.
as
the
court
will
see
there
substantially
identical
and
simply
reciting
the
prior
proceedings
and
judging
that
the
complaints
be
dismissed.
now
up
to
that
point,
the
two
cases
are
identical
for
all
material
purposes
and
it's
only
after
that
point
that
they're
filed
separate.
in
costello,
the
government
did
not
appeal
from
the
dismissal
order,
but
rather
simply
filed
the
new
complaint
with
the
required
affidavit.
it
was
met,
however
with
the
claim
by
costello
that
since
the
dismissal
order
of
the
prior
action
did
not
specify
that
it
was
without
prejudice,
it
operated
by
force
of
rule
41
(b)
as
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
and
barred
the
new
action.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument
and
it's
that
question
that
costello
seeks
to
raise
by
the
motion
to
amend
the
petition.
this
court
granted
the
main
petition
in
the
costello
which
raises
other
questions
which
are
being
argued
separately,
did
not
act
on
the
motion
to
leave
to
amend
the
petition
and
set
that
motion
down
for
argument
together
with
lucchese.
now,
in
the
meantime,
because
of
the
res
judicata
argument
being
made
in
the
costello,
the
government
sought
to
protect
itself
in
lucchese
by
appealing
in
the
original
proceedings
themselves
from
the
refusal
of
the
district
court
to
act
without
prejudice
to
a
dismissal
order.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
that
appeal
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
had
no
power
on
remand
to
do
anything
more
than
dismiss
as
this
court
had
said
without
embellishment
or
elaboration.
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
the
government's
petition
and
as
i
say,
consolidated
that
with
the
costello
motion.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
the
lucchese
appeal
was
--
i'm
not
sure
when
they
were
filed.
the
lucchese
appeal
was
decided
before
the
costello.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
and
we
had
filed
our
petition
before
costello
petition
was
due
here
for
that
reason.
and
actually,
we
filed
our
--
our
petition
was
primarily
a
protective
one
just
in
case
the
court
took
the
question
in
costello
so
we
would
be
protected
in
lucchese.
i
would
like
to
clarify
my
position
on
the
motion
to
amend
in
the
costello.
now,
when
that
was
filed
we
opposed
it
for
among
other
reasons,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
good
cause
but
failing
to
raise
issue
in
the
original
petition
and
the
court
ought
not
encourage
peace
bill
petitions,
but
now
that
the
court
has
granted
lucchese,
they
said
in
there,
the
costello
motion
is
somewhat
different.
the
questions
are
obviously
closely
related
and
if
the
court
is
going
to
hear
and
determine
lucchese
on
the
merits,
we
don't
see
how
we
can
continue
to
oppose
hearing
also
the
question
in
the
costello.
so
unless
the
court
concludes
that
it
should
dismiss
lucchese
also,
we
don't
oppose
the
motion
to
amend.
turning
the
merits,
i'll
deal
first
of
the
costello
case
and
the
question
there
posed
the
effect
of
the
dismissal
order
on
later
proceedings,
because
i
think
that's
the
basic
question.
his
argument,
as
i
say
is
that,
since
the
order
did
not
specify,
there
was
without
prejudice
that
operated
under
rule
41
(b)
as
a
dismissal
with
prejudice.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
argument
is
based
entirely
on
pure
technicality
since
judgment
(inaudible),
because
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
no
court
that
has
ever
been
involved
in
these
proceedings
intended
or
contemplated
that
result.
in
the
prior
proceedings
from
the
zucca
case
itself,
the
court
affirmed
the
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint
without
prejudice
to
new
proceedings.
when
these
cases
were
here
before,
they
were
here
with
four
--
with
two
other
cases,
a
total
of
four
cases.
in
the
lucchese
case
and
in
the
costello
--
well,
in
the
lucchese
case
and
the
diamond
case
from
the
ninth
circuit,
the
district
courts
had
dismissed
without
prejudice
because
of
the
lack
of
the
affidavit
and
in
the
costello
case,
the
district
court
had
dismissed
without
prejudice
though
for
other
reasons.
in
the
fourth
case
that
came
up,
the
mattels
case
the
district
court
had
refused
to
dismiss
at
all.
now,
in
the
second
circuit
to
which
three
other
cases
went
and
the
major
opinion
was
written
in
mattels,
the
court
stated
the
question
to
be
whether
the
late
filing
of
the
affidavit
was
sufficient
or
whether
the
government
was
required
to
institute
a
new
proceeding
with
a
new
service
or
process.
that
was
the
question
and
this
court,
when
it
took
the
case
and
simply
stated
that
the
complaint
had
to
be
filed
with
the
--
the
affidavit
had
to
be
filed
with
the
complaint
and
directed
the
district
court
to
dismiss,
decided
nothing
more
than
that.
i
think
that
is
clear.
so,
the
main
problem
is
how
we
can
avoid
that
unintended
result
of
how
the
rule
41
(b)
can
be
fairly
construed
not
to
produce
that
result.
the
rule,
it's
quoted
in
our
costello
brief
at
page
5,
the
last
sentence,
by
the
way
when
i
speak
of
rule
41
(b),
i'm
referring
only
to
the
last
sentence
which
is
the
only
part
involved
here,
with
pertinent
substance
that
unless
the
court
otherwise
specifies
in
the
order
a
dismissal
other
than
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
venue
shall
operate
as
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
now
there
are
two
ways
to
approach
the
interpretation
of
the
rule
one,
adopted
by
the
district
court
is
to
say
that
the
dismissal
here
was
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
that
by
the
way
is
the
characterization
of
the
dismissal
that
was
adopted
i
think
by
all
of
the
defendants
in
the
prior
proceedings
when
they
moved
to
dismiss.
they
filed
their
motions
to
dismiss
under
rule
12
(b)
as
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
now
the
jurisdiction
of
course
means
different
things
for
different
purposes
and
i
think
the
question
really
is
how
should
be
construed
for
purposes
of
this
rule
and
that
turns
on
what
purposes
of
the
rule
are
and
the
basic
purpose
i
think
is
evident.
the
rules
give
to
the
court
a
discretionary
power
in
a
number
of
instances
to
specify
the
effect
of
the
dismissal,
to
make
it
with
prejudice
or
without
prejudice.
that
is
true
of
dismissals
for
one
of
prosecution
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
for
failure
to
comply
with
an
order
and
for
insufficiency
of
proof
by
the
plaintiff.
now,
having
the
discretion
to
make
the
dismissal
either
way,
you
needed
a
presumption
to
control
the
case
where
the
court
failed
to
say
which
way
he
was
exercising
his
power
and
that's
what
rule
41
(b)
does.
it
says
that
unless
it
is
otherwise
specified,
he
shall
be
deemed
to
exercise
the
power
to
dismiss
with
prejudice
and
that
i
think
is
not
--
is
not
too
great
of
a
burden
on
the
plaintiff
because
he
knows
in
that
kind
of
situation
that
the
dismissal
maybe
one
way
or
the
other.
he
can
see
to
it
specifies
but
it's
intended.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
no
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
that
is
one
of
the
exemptions
and
the
district
court
held
that
we
are
within
that
exemption
and
that
is
really
what
i'm
arguing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
right.
that's
right.
and
our
argument
is
that
it
was
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
as
that
term
is
used
in
this
rule.
now
we
acknowledge
that
it
is
not
a
jurisdictional
defect
for
all
purposes.
it's
certainly
we
would
say
does
not
subject
a
final
judgment
to
collateral
attack
for
lack
of
that
requirement.
but
--
excuse
me,
you
have
to
give
jurisdictions
used
in
this
rule
quite
a
--
a
broad
scope
to
include
what
might
be
called
quasi
jurisdictional
defects
because
i
--
i
can
suggest
the
scope
of
dismissals
where
i
think
the
rule
would
be
--
produce
the
result
that
was
certainly
not
intended
otherwise.
we
--
the
problem
isn't
limited
to
this
particular
dismissal
here.
there
are
a
variety
of
dismissals
which
no
one
i
think
has
ever
thought
would
bar
later
proceedings,
nothing
in
the
rules
purports
to
give
the
judge
power
to
make
them
with
prejudice
and
which
can
be
accepted
only
if
you
put
them
under
the
heading
of
jurisdiction.
for
example,
a
dismissal
of
a
tax
refund
suit
for
failure
to
file
an
administrative
claim
for
refund,
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies,
a
dismissal
of
a
national
labor
relations
board
application
for
an
injunction
against
the
temporary
boycott
--
a
secondary
boycott
for
failure
to
make
a
preliminary
investigation,
dismissals
for
lack
of
an
indispensable
party,
for
lack
of
the
real
party
interest.
if
all
of
these
kinds
of
standard
or
specialized
grounds
for
dismissal
rising
out
statutory
preconditions
to
sue,
which
i
do
not
think
were
ever
intended
to
the
grounds
for
dismissals
with
the
prejudice
and
we
would
say
that
all
of
these
ought
to
be
characterized
for
this
particular
purpose
as
dismissals
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
what
they
have
in
common
is
that
they
--
as
fair
as
i
precondition
to
suit
and
it
stops
the
litigation,
a
threshold
is
never
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
merits
and
for
--
for
purposes
of
res
judicata,
they
are
exactly
like
any
other
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
now
there's
a
--
a
second
approach
which
was
adopted
by
judge
mcgruder
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
of
appeals.
and
i
think
it
can
be
best
phrased
as
turning
on
a
construction
of
the
beginning
words
unless
the
court
in
a
dismissal
order
otherwise
specifies.
now
costello
says
that
--
argues
that
an
order
otherwise
specifies
only
if
it
uses
the
magic
words
without
prejudice,
but
we
think
that
--
in
light
of
the
purpose
to
rule,
there's
no
reason
so
limit
it.
as
i've
said,
the
main
purpose
is
to
remove
the
ambiguity
in
cases
where
it
is
not
clear
whether
the
dismissal
is
on
the
merits
or
whether
the
district
court
has
exercised
a
discretionary
power
to
impose
a
dismissal
with
prejudice
as
a
sanction
for
some
dilatory
tactic
or
--
or
for
castrating
in
part.
now,
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
it
seems
to
me
that
an
order
specifies
otherwise
even
if
it
does
not
say
without
prejudice,
so
long
as
it
makes
clear
by
any
form
of
words
that
there
has
been
no
determination
on
the
merits
and
that
the
district
court
is
not
proportioned
to
exercise
a
discretionary
power
to
impose
a
dismissal
having
the
same
effect
as
one
of
the
merits.
now,
that
is
precisely,
i
think,
what
the
order
in
costello
shows.
it
clearly
shows
that
--
as
judge
mcgruder
said,
that
there's
been
no
--
no
determination
on
the
merits
and
that
the
district
court
did
not
exercise
whatever
discretionary
power
he
may
have
had
if
he
had
any
to
make
it
with
prejudice.
and
we
think
such
an
order
is
one
otherwise
specified.
and,
i
think
that
is
fully
in
accordance
with
everything
that
this
court
has
this
far
intended
in
these
cases.
i'd
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
lucchese
case,
which
actually
the
result
will
turn
primarily
upon
the
result
in
costello.
if
a
court
accepts
our
view
in
costello
that
the
original
order
was
not
barred
with
the
second
suit
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
that
--
that
moots
the
question
in
lucchese
because
we
were
aggrieved
by
the
failure
to
say
without
prejudice
only
because
of
the
doubt
of
what
the
effects
of
the
order
would
be
otherwise
and
if
this
court
settles
the
doubt,
there's
no
longer
a
practically
important
issue
in
lucchese.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
disagrees
who
doesn't
hope
there
is
a
bar,
then
i
think
it's
clear
from
what
i've
already
said
that
the
district
court
erred
in
lucchese
in
not
adding
the
words
without
prejudice.
so
i
think
the
only
separate
question
arising
in
the
lucchese
is
the
procedural
one
raised
by
lucchese,
namely,
whether
the
government
by
appealing
followed
the
wrong
the
procedure
to
correct
the
error.
lucchese's
argument
is
--
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
jurisdiction.
it
just
simply
does
not
have
power
to
decide
questions
of
compliance
with
this
court's
mandates
and
he
argues
that
this
is
that
kind
of
question.
now,
even
accepting
the
premise,
i
think
the
short
answer
is
that
this
is
not
a
question
of
compliance
with
this
court's
mandate.
it
is
clear
that
the
court
in
directing
--
remanding
case
with
direction
to
dismiss
did
not
purport
to
pass
on
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
dismissal
and
that
it
should
with
or
without
prejudice
and
it
was
therefore
in
matter
not
within
the
scope
of
the
mandate
and
a
new
issue
which
the
court
of
appeals
is
free
to
review.
and
that's
really
all
the
court
has
to
decide
in
the
case.
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
we,
by
no
means,
agree
with
the
premise
of
lucchese
is
that
there
are
any
limits
on
what
the
court
of
appeals
can
do
in
reviewing
actions
by
a
district
court,
simply
because
it
involves
among
other
things
or
solely
a
question
of
interpretation
of
a
mandate
of
this
court.
the
--
there
are
--
there
are
court
of
appeals'
decisions
supporting
that.
we
think
that
they
are
the
product
simply
of
a
historical
oversight
and
i
will
only
very
briefly
suggest
what
that
is
because
i
suggest
that
the
court
needs
to
reach
it.
the
--
in
cases
prior
to
1891
in
this
court,
the
court
established
that
questions
of
compliance
with
these
mandates
could
be
reviewed
by
it
either
on
mandamus
or
by
appeal.
now,
of
course
before
1891
there
were
no
courts
of
appeals
and
so
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
any
appeal
lay
only
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
it
would
seem
to
have
followed
that
when
the
courts
of
appeals
were
created
in
1891
and
since
the
questions
could
be
reviewed
by
ordinary
courts
of
appeal
that
you
could
appeal
the
court
of
appeals
from
a
final
judgment.
but
the
--
in
later
cases,
this
court
did
not
carefully
make
that
distinction
and
continued
to
repeat
the
old
language.
in
fact
however,
all
the
cases
held
were
that
the
remedy
of
mandamus
to
enforce
a
mandate
had
to
be
sought
in
the
supreme
court
and
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
although
as
i
say
that
the
--
some
courts
of
appeals
have
said
they
have
no
jurisdiction
of
appeal,
we
think
that
there's
no
valid
reason
whatsoever
for
that.
it
simply
confuses
the
processes
of
review.
lucchese
says
that
if
it
raises
a
new
issue,
we
must
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
if
it
raises
something
within
the
scope
of
the
mandate
we
must
somehow
come
to
this
court
and
--
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
matter
is
foreclosed
by
the
original
mandate,
is
usually
the
very
question.
and
so,
you
have
to
decide
the
merits
before
you
decide
jurisdiction
and
i
think
it
would
only
produce
unnecessary
protective
applications
to
this
court.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
sure
i
recall
that
case.
the
--
as
i
say
i
agree
there
are
some
court
of
appeals
cases
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
them
declining
to
review
questions
of
compliance.
our
only
point
really
is
that
historically
there
was
no
basis
for
that
limitation
on
their
jurisdiction
and
we
don't
understand
what
the
obstacle
is
to
their
reviewing
all
questions
of
compliance
with
mandate.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
a
little
surprised
by
the
argument
that
the
reason
for
the
failure
to
say
without
prejudice
was
the
institution
of
a
new
proceeding
on
different
grounds
than
the
original
proceeding.
this
is
not
an
argument
made
on
brief
and
it
was
my
understanding
that
the
reason
for
the
stipulation
in
the
dismissal
of
the
earlier
proceeding,
that
it
could
be
reinstituted
on
precisely
the
same
grounds
was
to
preserve
the
government's
rights
under
the
1940
act
rather
than
restrict
us
to
the
grounds
under
the
1952
act
and
not
to
protect
the
petitioner.
on
the
main
point,
the
effect
of
the
dismissal
as
i
argued
last
thursday,
our
primary
position
is
that
a
dismissal
for
failure
to
file
the
essential
statutory
prerequisite
to
a
denaturalization
proceeding
should
be
treated
as
a
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
and
therefore
expressly
accepted
from
the
operation
of
rule
41
(b).
i
want
to
emphasize
again
that
that
it
is
a
problem
that
goes
much
beyond
this
case,
that
there
a
lot
of
other
grounds
for
dismissals
for
failure
to
--
to
satisfy
various
preconditions
to
suit
such
as
the
administrated
claim
for
refund
before
a
tax
suit.
and
that
rule
41
(b)
would
have
a
--
i
think
a
very
wide
and
very
broad
and
equally
unintended
scope
if
these
things
were
not
treated
as
jurisdictional
for
that
purpose.
i
would
think
the
essential
precondition
to
a
judgment
operating
as
res
judicata
in
the
common
law
has
always
been
an
opportunity
in
the
prior
proceeding
to
litigate
the
merits.
it
may
not
be
limited
to
actual
adjudication
on
the
merits
but
at
least
there's
an
opportunity
to
adjudicate
the
merits
and
i
don't
think
anything
in
federal
rule
has
intended
to
change
that.
the
only
dismissals
that
the
rules
themselves
and
to
contemplate
be
made
with
prejudice
are
those
on
the
merits
or
for
frustrating
the
--
by
the
plaintiffs'
own
act
frustrating
an
adjudication
on
the
merits
such
as
his
failure
to
prosecute
or
his
failure
to
comply
with
the
production
order.
and
are
--
it
seems
to
us
that
to
confine
rule
41
(b)
to
what
we
think
was
purely
intended,
it
is
necessary
to
give
to
lack
of
jurisdiction
that
exception
a
broad
scope.
now,
on
the
lucchese
case,
i
would
like
to
state
again
that
if
the
government
prevails
in
costello
on
the
main
issue,
we
see
no
necessity
for
this
court's
deciding
the
questions
in
the
lucchese
case
but
it
might
simply
dismiss
the
writ
in
lucchese
on
the
grounds
that
with
the
dealt
removed
about
the
effect
of
the
order,
there's
no
present
necessity
of
a
--
resolving
the
jurisdictional
problems
in
the
lucchese
case.
you
will
have
to
reach
those
only
if
you
hold
against
us
on
this
issue
in
costello
and
we
would
think
that
better
course
will
be
disposed
of
the
costello
issue
first.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
no.
if
the
court
should
deny
the
motion
to
dismiss
--
the
motion
to
amend
the
petition
in
the
costello,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
have
no
objection
then
to
dismissal
of
lucchese
except
that
it's
already
been
argued
and
perhaps
is
well
to
go
ahead
and
decide
it.
now
if
you
remember
that
our
--
our
original
petition
in
lucchese
was
expressly
made
conditional
upon
the
court's
taking
the
same
question
in
costello.
we
did
not
originally
asked
the
court
to
decide
lucchese.
we
filed
that
only
protectively
and
we
would
not
seriously
object
to
its
being
dismissed
now.
i
think
however
that
since
it
has
been
argued,
it
may
be
as
well
for
the
court
to
proceed
to
dispose
off
the
question
that
is
here.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
and
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
i
think
i
would
say
that
if
leave
to
amend
the
petition
in
costello
is
denied,
the
government
would
have
no
objection
to
dismissal
of
lucchese.
the
only
reason
not
to
would
be
that
it's
--
it
has
been
argued
and
presented
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
you're
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
so,
our
first
contention
is
that
if
costello
is
taken
which
we
do
not
now
oppose.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
i
said
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
believe
i
said
if
it
--
if
it
--
if
the
question
is
taken
in
costello
to
precondition
to
our
position
on
that
question,
that
it
ought
to
be
treated
--
the
dismissal
should
be
treated
as
one
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
therefore
not
a
bar
to
the
substantive
proceeding.
thank
you.
