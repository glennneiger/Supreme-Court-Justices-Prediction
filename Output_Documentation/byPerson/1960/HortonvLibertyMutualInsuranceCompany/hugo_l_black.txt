justice

suppose
the
insurance
company
takes
it
up,
takes
it
up,
the
award
of
$1000,
original
claim
was
$14,000,
is
there
any
way
the
insurance
company
then
can
be
made
to
pay
the
$14,000
after
it
takes
it
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
--
they
could
be
made
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
has
to
counterclaim,
doesn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
in
determining
the
jurisdictions
of
federal
court,
it
got
to
go
on
what
the
company
claim
and
disregard
what
the
claimant
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
about
federal
court
jurisdiction?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
but
i
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
in
federal
court,
you
will
be
compelled
if
you
want
to
claim
the
$14,000
to
set
it
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
federal
court
has
jurisdiction
to
try
if
it
has
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
what
you
are
claiming
is,
as
i
understand,
federal
court
jurisdiction
must
be
determined
exclusively
by
the
amount
that
the
insurance
company
is
seeking
to
avoid
pay.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
congress
--
any
bill
had
been
offered
in
congress
since
this
opinion
came
down
in
this
connection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
did
not
make
my
question
clear.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
came
down
in
february
22nd,
1960.
it's
over
a
year
ago.
has
there
been
any
effort
made
to
get
the
bills,
the
law
changed
since
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
i
just
thought
--
i
just
thought
to
ask
you
this
question,
did
your
argument
mean
that
the
plaintiff,
in
this
particular
case,
does
--
can
go
into
the
federal
court
but
the
defendant
cannot?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
your
legal
argument,
but
is
the
result,
plaintiff
does
have
--
can
go
to
federal
court
if
it
has
jurisdiction
while
the
defendant
does
not
if
it's
--
unless
its
claim
is
moved
in
$10,000
award,
award
$10,000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
the
--
for
the
defendant,
but
there
is
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
because
--
is
that
the
result
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
can
it
--
can
it
be
anything
else?
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
it
can.
i
want
to
find
out
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can't
you
now
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
he
sued
for
$25,000
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
about
that,
sued
for
$25,000
for
personal
injury,
after
he
filed
the
suit,
he
comes
in
and
says
"i
am
not
going
to
reduce
this.
i'm
--
i
only
want
to
get
$9,000."
could
he
have
it
removed
back
to
the
state
court
then
or
have
it
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction?
i'm
not
sure
about
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
had
some
cases
whether
they
denied
me
that
right
(inaudible)
[laughs]
for
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
how
he
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
remember
they
did
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
practise
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
my
practice
was
in
those
and
i
had
to
do
it
a
number
of
times.
to
dismiss
that
suit,
you
pay
the
cost
and
then
claim
--
they
all
claim
$2999.99.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i've
done
it
many
times.
several
time
not
many
times
because
i
didn't
make
that.
it
takes
time.
i
hope.[laughter]
