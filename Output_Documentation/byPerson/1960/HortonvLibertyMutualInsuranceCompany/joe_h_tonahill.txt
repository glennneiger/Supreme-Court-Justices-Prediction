mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
involved
here
is
whether
the
amount
of
an
industrial
accident
board's
award
of
$1050
which
the
respondent
appeal
fixes
jurisdiction
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction
statute.
this
case
arose
in
texas
under
the
workmen's
compensation
law
of
texas.
the
injured
workman
horton
filed
his
claim
before
the
board
and
the
board
ruled
and
entered
to
file
award
allowing
him
30
weeks
at
$35
a
week.he
claimed
the
maximum
of
401
weeks
but
the
board
allowed
him
30
weeks.
on
the
day
of
the
award,
the
respondent
filed
it
directly
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
texas
seeking
to
set
aside
the
board's
award
of
$1050
and
vacating
it
and
holding
it
for
note,
claiming
jurisdiction
under
the
diversity
statute.
the
petitioner
horton
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
the
jurisdiction
was
not
present
because
the
amount
that
the
respondent
sought
to
relieve
itself
of
liability
for
was
only
$1050
and
did
not
meet
the
requisite
jurisdictional
requirement
of
$10,000
exclusive
of
interest
and
cost.
subject
to
the
motion
to
dismiss,
the
petitioner
horton
filed
a
counterclaim,
a
compulsory
counterclaim
subject
to
its
motion.the
trial
court
dismissed
both
the
main
action
of
respondent
and
the
counterclaim
as
well
on
the
ground
that
no
jurisdiction
attached.
under
the
workmen's
compensation
law
of
texas
article
8307,
section
5,
a
party
who
is
dissatisfied
with
the
ruling
of
the
board
has
a
right
to
appeal
from
that
award
to
set
that
award
aside.
that's
as
far
as
it
goes.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
well,
appeal
a
branch
that
--
to
set
it
aside.
yes,
sir,
appeal.
that's
what
it
would
be.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
it
would
--
it
would
be
an
appeal,
a
trial
de
novo,
sir.
and
that's
exactly
what
horton
did,
the
petitioner
here.
he
filed
his
notice
of
appeal.
the
law
requires
that
notice
of
appeal
must
be
given
in
a
suit
file
within
20
days
thereafter.
horton
gave
notice
of
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir.
to
set
aside
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
a
complaint.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
it
is.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
well,
it's
--
it's
called
an
appeal.
it's
called
a
suit
to
set
aside
--
it's
a
suit
to
set
aside
the
boards
award.
it's
a
trial
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir,
it
has
been
informed
here
that
the
claimant
gives
notice
that
he
does
not
satisfy
with
the
board's
award
of
$1050
and
will
appeal
therefrom
in
a
suit
of
--
in
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
well,
that's
the
--
that's
a
good
--
you're
getting
right
to
the
heart
of
it,
your
honor,
because
under
the
workmen's
compensation
law,
you
can
go
to
either
the
justice
court
depending
upon
the
amount
of
the
award
or
the
amount
being
claimed
which
has
jurisdiction
up
to
$200.
or
you
can
go
to
county
court
which
has
jurisdiction
from
$200
to
$1000
or,
if
the
highest
amount
under
the
act
is
claimed,
you
may
go
into
the
district
court
which
has
unlimited
jurisdiction
of
$500
and
up.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
claimed
in
the
claimant's
claim
that
he
files
with
industrial
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir.
and
that
is
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
claim
of
jurisdiction.
the
respondent
is
saying,
"we
want
to
relieve
ourselves
of
the
$1050
award
that
the
board
has
said
that
we
owed
the
claimant."
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
federal
court.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
we
went
to
state
court
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
and
back
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
in
the
county
where
the
injury
arose,
orange
county
district
--
district
court.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
district
court
of
orange
county.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
the
respondent,
on
the
date
of
the
award,
give
notice
of
appeal
that
same
date
and
filed
suit
in
the
federal
court
in
beaumont,
texas.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
instead
of
going
to
state
court,
they
could
have
gone
to
district
court
where
we
went.
and
we
filed
our
motion
to
dismiss
because
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
also
file
our
suit
in
state
court.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
the
only
court
we
say
that
could
have
gone
to,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
exactly
the
point.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
but
--
and
they
raise
to
the
court
of
that
charge
in
filing
their
notice
of
appeal
and
a
suit
the
same
day.
they
have
20
days
from
the
date
of
the
award
to
give
notice
of
appeal.
they
have
20
days
from
the
notice
to
file
your
suit.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
so
far
as
the
insurance
company
is
concerned,
it
would
be
the
amount
claimed
by
the
commission
if
they
should
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
it
should
--
it
should
be
the
amount
awarded
by
the
commission.
they
would
base
their
suit
on
an
appeal
to
the
court
as
to
the
amount
of
the
board's
award.
however,
to
eliminate
two
suits,
if
the
board
should
award
more
than
$500,
they
would
go
ahead
into
the
district
court
because
the
claimant
would
very
likely
go
into
the
district
court
too.
but
otherwise,
if
the
board
allowed
$200
and
the
--
and
the
claimant
was
willing
to
be
satisfied
of
that,
he
wouldn't
have
to
appeal
at
all.
and
if
the
carrier
appealed,
they
would
very
likely
go
into
that
court
or
go
into
a
higher
court
then
the
counterclaim
would
come
back.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
the
insurer
can
go
the
justice
court
or
to
the
county
court
or
to
the
district
court
because
under
the
state
rule
--
under
the
state
rule,
jurisdiction
can
be
fixed
in
the
highest
court
because
of
the
highest
amount
claimed
to
the
highest
amount
awarded.
if
the
claimant
claims
more
than
$1000
or
more
than
$500,
the
insurance
company
has
the
right
to
go
the
district
court,
that's
under
the
state
rule.
and
--
or
they
can
go
into
the
court
where
the
amount
of
the
award
is
--
is
determined
for
the
--
either
the
county,
the
--
the
justice,
the
county
or
the
district
court.
but
the
rule
under
--
on
the
federal
jurisdiction
is
not
the
same
because
it
determined
the
--
the
amount
of
the
award.
and
that's
what
they're
seeking.
that's
the
pecuniary
object
of
the
respondent's
suit
in
coming
into
the
district
--
federal
district
court
is
to
relieve
itself
of
that
liability.
but
what
the
respondent
seeks
to
do
is
to
engraft
on
the
claimant's
claim
for
the
maximum
benefits
before
the
administrative
board.
they're
seeking
to
say,
"well,
because
he
had
a
claim
before
the
board
of
$14,035
that
gives
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
under
the
$10,000
statute."
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
only
after
a
trial
and
--
and
judgment.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
oh,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
claimant
would
then
counterclaim
under
his
compulsory
counterclaim
rights,
and
then
have
a
trial,
and
if
they
recovers
that
amount,
that's
exactly
what
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right.
if
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
we
did
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
he
has
to
or
he's
--
he's
out.
it's
set
aside
automatically.
either
--
either
side
has
a
right
to
appeal
and
if
the
claimant
is
not
the
appellant,
then
he
must
counterclaim
and
seek
to
recover
and
then
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
him.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
anytime.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
it's
exactly
like
the
collins
case,
in
a
condemnation
suit,
your
honor,
no
difference.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir.
it's
--
that's
the
unusual
thing
about
the
act.
in
texas
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
you
have
a
right
of
proper
jury
trial.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir.
six
--
six-man
jury.
trial
de
novo
on
the
proponents
of
the
evidence
rule.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
he
--
he
very
well
could,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
no,
your
honor.
he
claimed
the
maximum
benefits
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
before
the
industrial
accident
board.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
they
--
they
wanted
--
they
gave
him
only
$1050.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
no,
no,
your
honor.
he's
--
he
filed
his
counterclaim
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
compulsory
counterclaim
subject
to
his
motion
to
dismiss,
and
federal
court
will
lack
the
jurisdiction
and
then
in
state
court,
he
filed
his
suit
to
appeal
from
the
board's
awards
set
for
the
maximum
amount.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
yes,
sir,
but
he
wanted
to
get
it
in
the
court
of
his
choice
that
congress
gave
him
in
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
in
the
amendment
in
1958.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
he
--
and
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
and
that
too
is
a
very
valuable
right
that
he
is
claiming.
and
we
contend
that
the
respondent
and
the
court
below
[laughs]
has
sought
to
apply
the
state
rule
to
a
federal
jurisdiction
question
in
order
to
manipulate
jurisdiction
that
does
not
exist.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
no,
sir.
his
position
is
he
wants
his
$14,000
but
he
wants
it
in
state
court,
the
court
of
his
choice
that
congress
gave
him.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
no,
[laughs]
i
don't
think
there's
any
different
(inaudible)
massachusetts
your
honor.
but
there's
a
difference
in
the
trial
you
get
in
the
federal
court
and
--
and
in
trial
you
get
in
state
court
because
of
the
geographical
distribution
of
the
divisions
in
the
--
in
texas.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
not
entirely
for
state
court
jurisdictional
purpose
--
purposes.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
the
only
--
the
only
point
in
federal
court
jurisdiction
is
the
amount
of
the
board's
award,
your
honor.
the
board
must
award,
must
say
to
the
insurance
company,
"you
owe
this
man
$10,000
or
more."
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
if
it
has
jurisdiction
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
in
the
first
instance,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
exactly,
and
it
must
exceed
$10,000.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
he
can
claim
less.
that's
right.
he
can
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
true.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
this
is
an
original
action.
but
the
year
before
this
said
rule
a
year
before
the
congress
amended
the
act,
there
were
2147
of
these
cases
brought
to
federal
court,
about
1000
of
them,
original
actions
and
about
1140
by
removal.
and
if
my
position
is
correct,
it'll
be
about
1000
a
year
if
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
--
insofar
as
case
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
the
first
case
we
had
in
mind,
davis
versus
department
of
labor.[laughs]
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
no,
your
honor,
because
congress
forbid
that
in
1958.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
exactly,
sir.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
no,
sir.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
it's
--
it's
not
within
--
it's
$1050
in
the
1958
limitation.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
precisely.
they
could
not
remove
our
case
in
the
district
court
in
orange
county
for
$14,000.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
relying
on
our
claim
before
the
board.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
before
the
board,
yes,
sir.
they're
trying
to
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
--
they're
trying
to
determine
our
claim
before
the
board
under
the
state
test.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
it
gives
--
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
we
could
be,
we
couldn't
be.
we
--
we
can
claim
less
but
--
in
court
to
the
claim
before
the
board.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
we
--
we
claim
more
subject
to
our
county,
subject
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
though
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
right,
your
honor,
which
is
the
state
court
in
this
instance
as
--
because
congress
said
what
you
will
do.
mr.
joe
h.
tonahill
that's
a
wonderful
thing.[laughter]
