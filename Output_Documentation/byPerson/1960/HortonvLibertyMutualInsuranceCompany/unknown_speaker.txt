no,
i
think
there
could
be
any
--
any
removal
in
reference
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
black.
i
would
take
this
position
on
jurisdictional
amount.
if
the
board
awards
more
than
$10,000,
then
for
purposes
of
jurisdictional
amount
when
the
insurance
company
brings
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
board's
award,
the
jurisdictional
amount
will
be
present.
on
the
other
hand,
any
time
the
board
issues
an
award
for
less
than
$10,000,
it
is
our
position
the
suit
to
set
aside
the
board's
award
which
is
the
only
right
created
under
state
statute
possessed
by
insurance
company.
in
all
those
cases,
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction.
now,
this
will
knock
out
