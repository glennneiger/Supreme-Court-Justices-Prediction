mr.
william
vandercreek
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
feel
that
the
nub
of
the
jurisdictional
amount
problem
before
this
court
serves
on
what
is
the
object
of
the
plaintiff
insurance
companies
claim
for
relief.
we
say
this
because
the
question
before
this
court
is
a
question
of
whether
congress
is
giving
the
united
states
district
court
federal
jurisdiction
over
a
state
created
cause
of
action.
mr.
william
vandercreek
we're
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
section
1332
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
the
diversity
court
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
actions
where
the
matter
in
controversy
exceeds
the
sum
or
value
of
$10,000
exclusive
of
interest
and
cost.
our
position
is,
under
federal
law,
that
the
matter
in
controversy
in
this
suit
does
not
exceed
more
than
$10,000.
the
court
below
in
finding
greater
jurisdictional
amount
applied
state
law.
the
only
cause
of
action
that
is
possessed
by
the
plaintiff
insurer
is
the
right
to
set
aside
$1050
award.
under
the
federal
rule,
as
we
understand
decisions
of
this
court,
the
amount
in
controversy
is
said
to
be
the
direct
and
immediate
object
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
for
relief.
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
not
key
to
potential
counterclaims.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
vandercreek
we
could
have
been
foreclosed,
your
honor.
i
suppose
if
the
district
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
we
don't
know,
your
honor.
for
this
reason
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
sir?
mr.
william
vandercreek
well,
the
time
limit
for
filing
a
counterclaim
whether
it'd
expired
would
have
obtained
permission
of
the
district
court
to
then
file
a
late
counterclaim.
mr.
william
vandercreek
if
our
time
limit
has
expired,
here
is
the
problem
on
that,
your
honor.
there
is
a
time
limit
also
in
filing
counterclaim
in
relationship
to
the
appeal
from
the
industrial
accident
board.
the
parties
must
give
their
notice
within
20
days
and
then
file
suit
within
20
days.
now,
what
has
happened
in
some
instances,
the
insurance
company
has
appealed,
defendant
employee
failed
to
counterclaim
and
he
was
thrown
out
on
this
jurisdictional
motion
and
he
lost
his
right
to
come
in
federal
or
lost
his
right
to
claim
any
compensation.
mr.
william
vandercreek
[laughs]
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
sir.
the
employee
could.
the
employee
could
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
he
could
counterclaim
for
--
in
this
case,
for
any
amount
up
to
$14,035.
he
could
counterclaim
for
$2000
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
right.
the
maximum
compensation
that
he's
entitled
to
under
the
state
workmen's
compensation
act
which
is
$14,035.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor.
his
cause
of
action
is
given
to
him
by
the
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
state
courts
and
his
trying
to
report
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes.
mr.
william
vandercreek
as
mr.
tonahill
pointed
out,
either
party
can
move
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
to
set
aside
the
board's
award.
mr.
william
vandercreek
well,
this
is
why
we
have
to
counterclaim
because
we
were
worried
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
you
are
undoubtedly
--
perhaps
thinking
some
language
in
the
st.
paul
mercury
case
which
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
beg
the
court's
apology.
we
claim
that
the
court
below,
the
fifth
circuit
erred
in
applying
a
state
rule
for
determining
jurisdictional
amount
rather
than
a
federal
rule
for
determining
jurisdictional
amount.
as
i
stated,
our
position
is
a
federal
rule
is
a
key
to
the
insurer's
cause
of
action.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
booth
versus
texas
employers'
insurance
association.
this
is
a
state
case
which
the
fifth
circuit
said
was
controlling.
our
reason
for
referring
to
this
case
is
to
show
that
they
apply
the
mere
rule
for
determining
jurisdictional
amount
which
is
not
based
upon
the
claim
for
relief
asserted
by
the
insurance
company
in
their
complaint.
but
first
of
all,
the
record
at
page
43
of
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion,
they
misstate
the
holding
of
the
booth
case.
at
page
43
of
the
record,
the
fifth
circuit
states
that
regardless
of
who
brings
the
suit
that
the
supreme
court
in
texas
quite
logically
held
that
the
amount
in
controversy
is
the
amount
of
the
claim.
with
deference
to
the
fifth
circuit,
this
statement
is
totally
incorrect,
with
one
exception,
i
should
add.
booth
held
that
the
amount
in
controversy
in
a
suit
by
employee
that
says
that
board's
award
was
amount
as
presented
in
this
court
petition
without
reference
to
what
he
had
claimed
before
the
board.
moreover,
in
suits
by
the
insurance
company
says
that
the
board's
award
where
the
employee
has
not
claimed
a
fixed
amount
before
the
industrial
accident
board,
the
amount
in
controversy
under
the
state
law
is
the
amount
of
the
board's
award.
the
booth
case
at
132
tex.
252
commented
on
and
said
their
state
rule
for
determining
jurisdictional
amount
to
rule
it
was
implied
in
this
case
was
mere
logical
rule
in
view
of
the
other
holdings
that
the
amount
in
controversy
is
determined
by
a
plan
of
court's
petition.
now,
again,
considering
what
we
consider
to
be
the
crux
of
the
case
upon
the
object
of
insurer's
claim
for
relief,
the
respondent,
in
his
brief,
takes
the
position
at
page
1,
they're
seeking
to
be
relieved
of
a
claim
liability
of
$14,035
asserted
by
court.
in
a
case,
as
he
cites
on
page
89
are
declaratory
judgement
act
cases.
we
feel
that
the
respondent's
position
is
basically
trying
to
convert
his
action
into
a
form
of
declaratory
relief
saying
that
he's
seeking
to
get
rid
of
a
$14,000
claim.
our
position
and
the
reasons
why
we
feel
the
plaintiff's
claim
in
this
suit
only
involves
$1050
or
as
follows.
first
of
all,
the
very
statute
which
creates
the
state
cause
of
action,
texas
statute
article
8307,
section
5
gives
the
party
a
right
to
set
aside
the
board's
award.
it
is
not
authorized
declaratory
relief.
secondly,
under
the
texas
statute
case
as
construing
the
statute,
the
amount
in
controversy
is
not
key
to
the
claim
before
the
board
with
one
exception
with
the
amount
involved
in
the
court
petition.
moreover,
the
respondent's
pleadings
in
this
very
case,
he
asked
if
the
board's
award
would
be
set
aside.
he
does
not
seek
declaratory
relief
to
avoid
paying
of
$14,035
potential
claim.
moreover,
the
final
reason
why
we
feel
that
his
claim
only
involves
$1050
because
it's
necessary
for
the
employee
to
come
in
and
counterclaim
and
when
he
comes
in
and
counterclaims,
the
amount
that
he
will
recover
will
depend
upon
his
counterclaim
and
not
what
he
claimed
before
the
board.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
it
couldn't.
they
got
in
the
federal
court
the
same
day
that
the
board's
award
came
down.
i'm
afraid
it
has
to
go
behind
the
record
to
explain
what's
going
on
in
those
situations
but
their
suit
to
set
aside,
the
board's
award
was
filed
in
federal
court
the
same
day
that
the
industrial
accident
board
came
down.
we
then
wanted
the
state
court
to
file
an
action
in
state
court.
we
came
back
and
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
federal
court
or
subject
to
counterclaim.
the
respondent
also
filed
a
plea
in
abatement
to
our
state
court
action.
the
plea
in
abatement
is
set
out
in
appendix
c
to
our
main
brief.
his
plea
in
abatement
to
prevent
the
workman
from
trying
his
case
in
state
court
was
based
on
the
fact
that
their
prior
filing
of
a
suit
in
federal
court,
as
this
is
going
a
turn
into
a
raise
to
the
courthouse.
the
insurance
company
can
beat
the
employee
every
time.
mr.
william
vandercreek
the
district
--
we
do
not
urge
the
abstention
doctrine
because
the
district
court
was
under
appealing
--
under
the
appealing
by
following
the
previous
district
court
opinion
in
national
surety
company
versus
chamberlain
that
no
federal
jurisdiction
exists.
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
texas
dismissed
the
suit
for
want
of
federal
jurisdictional
amount
was
that
the
fifth
circuit
reversed
and
reinstated
it.
we
have
still
been
unable
to
get
to
trial
in
state
court
because
of
the
plea
in
abatement.
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
your
honor.
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
as
set
out
in
the
senate
report
was
to
give
the
employee
the
choice
of
forms
to
equate
this
type
of
state
workmen's
compensation
act
like
the
jones
act
before
the
insurance
company
merely
removed
the
federal
court.
now,
still
removing,
they
go
in
the
federal
court
and
then
our
position
is
they
make
them
out
in
controversy
not
dependent
on
their
cause
of
action
but
they
pitch
it
to
a
potential
counterclaim
which
may
be
asserted
by
employee.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
it
has
not,
your
honor.
we
thought
that
the
statute,
as
enacted,
would
accomplish
the
satisfactory
purpose
released
the
people
who
supported
and
thought
it
would.
and
as
you
know,
the
judicial
conference
approved
the
prohibition
of
removal
of
jurisdiction,
that's
set
out
in
page
10a
of
appendix.
now,
i'm
scarcely
urging
any
estoppel
on
this
court
but
still,
we
don't
think
the
purpose
of
that
legislation
which
is
set
out
clearly
in
the
senate
report
should
be
emasculated
through
a
judicial
decision.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
i
certainly
do
in
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
your
honor.
we
set
out
the
statistics
and
some
highlights
from
that
report
as
appendix
a
on
page
1a
and
these
statistics
are
set
out
on
page
5a
of
our
brief.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor,
referred
both
to
texas
and
also
pointed
out
in
the
senate
report
that
there's
some
other
states.
i
believe
i've
mentioned
new
mexico,
louisiana
and
one
other
state
and
where
this
problem
of
jurisdiction
over
state
workmen's
compensation
case
has
been
clogging
the
federal
doctrine.
the
most
acute
problem
is
of
course
in
the
position
of
texas.
mr.
william
vandercreek
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
congress
also
increased
the
jurisdictional
amount,
as
you
recall,
from
$3000
to
$10,000
in
an
effort
to
reduce
diversity
jurisdiction.
they
prohibit
removal
expressly
according
to
senate
report
to
give
the
employee
a
choice.
but
we
oppose
as
insurance
company
coming
in
federal
court
basing
the
amount
in
controversy
now
upon
the
right
to
set
aside
$1000
award
that
fits
to
the
potential
counterclaim
which
the
employee
inserted
against
them.
they're
preventing
the
employee
from
going
into
state
court
which
we
feel
the
senate
report
clearly
and
expressly
indicated.
mr.
william
vandercreek
i
would
still
argue
under
the
senate
report
that
the
federal
court
should
abstain.
but
also
we'd
have
the
problem
there
of
whether
or
not
this
constitutions
an
original
civil
action
as
i
already
pointed
out
that
says
isn't
an
appeal
but
it's
a
trial
de
novo
but
nevertheless,
it's
still
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor.
but
it
has
this
limitation
because
it
is
appeal
de
novo
the
cause
of
action
tried
on
appeal
must
be
the
same
thing
as
asserted
below.
for
example,
in
the
herd
case
which
is
decided
in
the
record
on
page
44,
the
insurance
company
has
the
right
to
request
the
party
to
submit
to
an
operation.
the
herd
case
is
held
because
they
did
not
make
that
request
before
the
board,
that,
therefore,
it
should
not
raise
it
for
the
first
time
on
the
appeal
de
novo
because
you
were
dealing
with
an
appeal
and
is
not
purely
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
william
vandercreek
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
rephrase.
i
hope
i
did
not
give
the
court
erroneous
impression.
congress,
in
its
report,
did
not
say
that
the
federal
court
should
abstain
from
exercising
jurisdiction.
but
i
think
the
language
is
so
clearly
expressed
in
the
senate
report
as
to
what
they're
trying
to
accomplish
as
being
completely
circumvented
by
this
type
of
action.
mr.
william
vandercreek
i
think
it
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
would
be
very
proper
to
abstain.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor,
because
it
expressly
states
in
the
report
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
increasing
jurisdictional
amount
was
to
avoid
the
federal
courts
from
furthering
away
their
time
and
trial
of
petty
controversies.
now,
most
of
these
cases,
we
cited
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
there
was
not,
you're
--
under
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement.
mr.
william
vandercreek
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
well,
i
don't
have
any
later
statistics
but
i
believe
the
administrative
officer
of
united
states
courts
will
bear
me
out
on
this
that
there
are
very
few
cases
now
being
filed
as
original
actions
in
federal
court
after
the
prohibition
of
removal.
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
employees
sometimes
file
original
action
to
federal
court
because
he
knew
in
advance
the
insurance
company
was
going
to
remove.
mr.
william
vandercreek
i
believe
it's
expressed
as
to
who
brought
them
there.
mr.
william
vandercreek
that's
very
true.
the
employee
--
before
the
1958
amendment,
the
employee
was
the
one
that
most
automatically
to
bring
a
suit
to
set
aside
the
board's
award.
and
he
could
bring
it
under
the
decisions
of
that
time
either
federal
court
or
state
court.
when
he
brought
in
state
court,
the
insurance
company
would
remove
to
federal
court.
mr.
william
vandercreek
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter?
mr.
william
vandercreek
with
reference
to
your
first
question
on
the
winter
haven
case,
the
only
case
which
i
could
cite
back
would
be
louisiana
power
and
light
company
versus
city
of
thibodaux,
i
certainly
grant,
your
honor,
that
case
can
be
distinguished
from
the
facts
in
this
particular
proceeding.
so,
it
won't
be
any
doubt
that
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
federal
jurisdiction
that
the
federal
jurisdiction
will
now
--
is
not
present
in
this
controversy.
and
our
abstention
theory
is
purely
an
alternative
and
infringement
fact,
the
position,
your
honor.
in
the
senate
report,
as
i
recall
it,
there
was
some
comments
on
workmen's
compensation
act
in
which
they
point
that
in
most
states,
it
is
so
connected
up
with
the
administrative
action
that
the
courts
do
not
have
original
jurisdiction.
in
the
senate
report,
there's
--
we're
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
didn't
have
an
industrial
accident
board
in
texas,
i
believe,
but
they
consider
it
to
be
an
original
civil
action.
there
has
been
no
federal
case
to
my
knowledge
which
is
expressly
considered
a
problem
of
whether
or
not
an
appeal
from
the
texas
industrial
accident
board
even
though
it'd
be
a
trial
de
novo
is
an
original
action
for
purposes
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
your
honor.
as
i've
mentioned,
i'm
sure
without
going
to
court,
our
position
is
that
the
respondent
is
going
in
--
in
federal
court.
his
cause
of
action
must
be
based
on
his
claim
and
not
key
to
a
potential
counterclaim.
mr.
william
vandercreek
we
feel
that
the
--
all
decisions
of
this
court
in
determining
the
amount
in
controversy
had
based
upon
the
plaintiff's
claim.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
because
that's
his
cause
of
action.
mr.
william
vandercreek
well,
there's
one
thing
that
would
handicap
me
in
answering
completely
yes
that
--
your
honor.
the
senate
report
says
they
want
to
give
the
employee
the
choice
of
form.
and
i
supposed
under
the
senate
report
that
they
wanted
to
let
the
employee
choose
if
you
want
to
go
on
federal
court
or
go
in
--
in
state
court.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
the
new
mexico,
as
i
understand
your
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
the
new
mexico
and
also,
i
believe,
in
louisiana,
but
in
new
mexico,
there
is
no
prior
proceeding
before
the
board.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
the
principal
thrust,
the
senate
report
was
concerned
with
the
problem
of
texas
on
our
position
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
well,
i
assume
he
will.
mr.
william
vandercreek
with
reference
to
our
position
on
the
counterclaim,
we're
relying
rule
12
(b)
and
41
(c),
the
--
previously
been
mentioned
the
employee
has
to
file
a
counterclaim.
he
can't
take
a
chance.
i'm
trying
to
speculate
what
the
outcome
will
be
on
its
motion
to
dismiss.
there
are
two
district
court
cases
which
discussed
where
the
rule
12
(b)
applies
to
defenses
or
other
objections
where
there's
a
counterclaim
present.
one
case
is
hook
versus
--
&
ackerman
versus
hirsh,
which
is
cited
on
the
record
page
45,
contrary
position
which
has
held
that
rule
12
(b)
does
apply
to
subject
to
counterclaim
is
not
cited
in
the
briefs
is
keil
lock
versus
earle
hardware,
16
f.r.d.
388
by
judge
walsh.
mr.
william
vandercreek
i
would
believe
the
appendix
in
page
6a
and
7a
which
is
an
excerpt
from
the
senate
report
reading
from
7a
it
says,
"this
proposed
legislation
of
conflicts
is
the
same
purpose
and
grants
the
same
privilege
to
workmen
who
are
entitled
to
compensation
under
state
compensation
act."
that
is
the
workman
has
asked
and
filed
his
case
in
either
federal
court
or
state
court.
if
he
files
in
the
state
court,
it
is
not
removal
to
the
federal
court.
now,
if
the
respondent
can
come
into
federal
court
upon
the
cause
of
actions,
the
way
he
has
asserted,
it
makes
a
complete
nullity
of
this
particular
provision.
we
say
that
congress
closed
the
backdoor
of
the
federal
courthouse.
he
should
not
be
able
to
get
in
the
front
door
by
manipulating
the
amount
in
controversy.
mr.
william
vandercreek
we
feel
that
the
employee
may
go
into
federal
court
because
his
cause
of
action
besides
being
right
merely
says,
"i
have
board's
award."
he
could
state
a
claim
for
$14,035.
on
the
other
hand,
we
say
that
the
only
thing
facing
the
insurance
company
is
the
$1050
award.unless,
he
brings
suit
to
set
aside
the
board's
award
that
$1050
award
becomes
binding
upon
both
parties
and
then
the
next
procedure
is,
no
one
gives
notice
of
dissatisfaction
within
20
days,
the
employee
can
then
bring
suit
on
$1050
award
for
penalty
and
for
attorney's
fees
but
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
because
he's
asserting
a
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
it
could
very
well
be.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
rest
and
see
me
evade
the
question.
no,
sir,
that's
absolutely
true.
if
our
position
is
sustained,
the
employee
will
have
an
option
to
go
on
federal
court
or
state
court
and
the
insurance
company
because
well,
over
99%
of
awards
are
below
$10,000
will
not
be
able
to
go
in
federal
court
to
set
aside
the
award.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor.
that's
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
precisely,
because
the
insurance
company
is
really
the
true
defendant.
and
when
they
prohibited
the
defendant's
right
to
remove,
they've
tossed
him
out
in
going
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor.
that's
precisely
true.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor.
they
remove
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
well,
our
position
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
in
st.
paul
mercury
case,
the
expression
was
used
that
the
amount
in
controversy,
as
set
forth
by
the
plaintiff's
complaint,
is
controlling
unless
it
appears
to
legal
certainty
unless
it
is
involved.
mr.
william
vandercreek
let
me
make
this
point,
if
i
may
then,
your
honor.
the
removal
statute,
they
would
file
a
suit
in
actual
state
court
and
then
it
would
remove
from
state
court
to
federal
court.
it
was
not
removed
directly
from
the
industrial
accident
board
into
the
federal
court.
mr.
william
vandercreek
that's
correct.
i'm
not
making
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
then
--
that's
why
we
make
that
position
because
we're
taking
another
position
toward
the
purpose
of
the
statute
prohibiting
removal.
we
also
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes.
he
says
--
he
says
he
doesn't
even
owe
$1050.
the
board
gave
$1050.
he
says
that
this
is
too
much.
we
want
this
$1050
award
thrown
out.
that
is
the
language
which
i
believe
is
used
in
the
pleadings
as
filed
by
the
insurance
company
in
this
suit.
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this
that
at
the
time
he
filed
the
suit,
he
doesn't
know
whether
the
employees
are
going
to
counterclaim
for
anything
or
not.
the
employee
may
be
perfectly
satisfied.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
that's
right.
but
the
employee
could
come
back
and
counterclaim
for
$2000
in
a
suit
by
$1050
and
then
you
have
a
dispute
involving
$2000
which
will
be
litigated
in
the
federal
district
court
even
though
the
jurisdictional
amount
requirement
says
$10,000.
mr.
william
vandercreek
we
have
just
one
comment
to
make
and
reply,
your
honor.
you
ask
where
there
are
any
cases
where
the
employee
did
not
file
a
counterclaim.
there's
one
cited
in
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
2.
it
is
morris
versus
maryland
casualty
company
130
s.w.2d
1080.
in
that
case,
the
employee
did
not
file
a
counterclaim,
he
claimed
that
the
court
didn't
have
--
didn't
have
--
state
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
the
court
held
that
jurisdiction
was
present
and
he
loss
out
entirely
because
it's
necessary
for
the
employee
to
come
in
and
counterclaim.
the
mere
filing
of
the
suit
by
insurance
company
to
set
aside
the
award
has
the
effect
of
terminating
that
award.
he
must
appeal
from
the
final
award.
now,
all
these
rules
concerning
the
texas
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
if
he
wants
to
get
any
compensation,
he
is
going
to
have
to
file
some
sort
of
counterclaim,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
under
texas'
practices
theory
will
be
to
actually
file
a
--
a
counterclaim.
in
federal
practice,
he
would
probably
--
he
never
says
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
entitled
to
the
board's
award.
mr.
william
vandercreek
in
the
morris
case
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
the
board
awarded,
as
i
recall,
around
$300.
the
suit
was
brought
in
the
county
court
by
insurance
company
to
set
aside
the
board's
award.
the
employee
moved
to
dismiss
on
grounds
that
his
claim
involved
more
than
$300
and
that
should
have
brought
in
the
state
district
court.
the
case
held
and
since
he
had
not
claimed
the
specified
amount
before
the
industrial
accident
board,
just
file
the
mere
claim
that
the
texas
rule
in
suits
--
in
that
instance,
of
suits
to
--
by
insurers
to
set
aside
the
board's
award
that
the
amount
in
controversy
was
the
amount
of
the
award.
they
held
that
the
county
court
had
jurisdiction
and
they
also
held
that
the
employee
because
he
failed
to
file
a
counterclaim
would
take
nothing.
the
--
all
the
rules
applicable
to
the
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
he
ain't
going
to
think,
your
honor,
because
when
the
insurance
company
came
in
to
set
aside
the
board's
award
unless
he
comes
in
and
stands
on
his
two
feet
and
presents
his
claim,
he's
all
through.
mr.
william
vandercreek
well,
he
just
moved
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
and
they
said
--
held
that
since
he
failed
to
file
a
counterclaim,
it
was
just
flock
as
far
as
the
employee
was
concern.
he
was
not
giving
the
option
of
going
back
in
and
filing
a
counterclaim
as
he
attempted
to
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
that
is
true.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes.
he
had
merely
moved
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
vandercreek
won
by
default
because
his
motion
to
dismiss
for
want
of
jurisdiction
is
bad
court
rule
in
motion
to
dismiss
want
of
jurisdiction
and
holding
there
was
jurisdiction.
he
chose
to
rely
on
his
motion
of
no
jurisdiction.
he
lost
and
he
said
in
the
appellate
court,
"we're
not
going
to
send
it
back
for
retrial
or
permitting
to
amend."
mr.
william
vandercreek
that
is
precisely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
vandercreek
it's
morris
versus
maryland
casualty
company,
130
s.w.2d
1080.
it
cites
in
the
reliance
upon
the
booth
case.
the
booth
case
is
the
texas
case
which
sets
out
the
various
rules
and
steps
and
appeals
from
the
board
in
amount
in
controversy.
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
i
was
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
would
say
that
most
of
the
petitions
filed
with
the
board
would
probably
be
for
--
well,
let
me
say
i
don't
know
first
of
all.
but
by
and
large,
the
attorneys
who
practice
in
the
workmen's
comp
--
in
texas
usually
are
trying
to
file
an
action
for
total
and
permanent
disability.
now,
even
though
the
person
just
lost
his
little
finger,
he
can
say
besides
claiming
for
loss
of
the
finger,
which
is
specified
amount,
he
can
also
say
that
the
loss
of
his
finger
affected
his
entire
body
and
now
he's
totally
and
permanently
disabled.
to
protect
themselves,
they
were
quite
often
automatically
file
a
maximum,
they
don't
--
total
and
permanent.
they
don't
have
to
claim
permanent
and
partial.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
there
is.
sometimes
the
workman
will
just
write
in
a
letter
requesting
a
claim
where
he
does
not
specify
any
amount
before
the
board.
the
texas
rule
for
the
term
jurisdiction
and
a
suit
by
insurance
company
is
the
amount
of
the
board's
award.
this
is
all
--
i
mean,
all
the
texas
rules
are
summarized
in
the
booth
case.
the
fifth
circuit
made,
in
this
representation
saying
regardless
who
brings
a
suit,
it's
the
amount
in
controversy,
it's
the
amount
employee
claim
before
the
board.
that
is
not
what
the
booth
case
held.
it
held
in
a
suit
by
employee
to
set
aside
the
board's
award.
it
was
not
his
claim
to
avoid
a
privilege
in
his
court
petition.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
he
could.
he
could
file
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
but
he
claims
the
loss
of
a
leg,
he
also
claimed
total
and
permanent
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
before
the
board.
mr.
william
vandercreek
the
award
which
--
which,
itself,
is
--
supersedes
the
administrative
claim
is,
in
itself,
set
aside
by
the
filing
of
the
suit.
when
you
file
a
suit
to
set
aside
the
board's
award
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
no,
your
honor.
mr.
cobb
gave
absolutely
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
the
correct
answer
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
--
neither
with
the
claim
filed
before
the
board.
but
you
have
to
put
--
mr.
william
vandercreek
not
and
then
ask
could
you
--
it's
jurisdictional
of
the
award
and
the
claim,
a
matter
which
is
explained
in
the
booth,
and
you
do
have
to
put
in
your
pleadings
and
as
he
did,
i
believe,
it's
on
page
--
top
of
page
3
of
the
record,
asked
for
it
to
be
set
aside.
mr.
william
vandercreek
yes,
he
cannot
tell
the
jury,
"you
got
an
award
for
such
and
such."
it
goes
to
the
court
and
not
to
the
jury.
