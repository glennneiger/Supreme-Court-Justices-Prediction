justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
this
case,
did
the
claimant
infinitively
claimed
merely
what
the
--
we
all
board
awarded
him
a
$1000?
did
he
make
a
choice
so
that
under
no
circumstances
will
he
ever
claim
more
than
that
$1000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
did
--
did
he
--
did
he
take
action
whereby
the
--
whatever
went
into
court,
i
use
that
neutral
term,
whatever
went
into
court,
you
just
told
us
that
means
a
de
novo
trial,
did
he
take
any
action
whereby
the
controversy
in
court
could
never
be
beyond
$1000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
he
thereafter
--
the
industrial
accident
board
went
against
him,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
went
against
him
for
the
--
for
the
larger
amount.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
he
take
a
step
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
whereby
he,
infinitively,
finally
never
would
claim
more
than
$1000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
is
still
subject
to
all
qualification
you
give
him,
he
is
still
was
out
to
get
$14,000,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
whole
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
--
i
think
you
want
to
get
into
the
legal
question.
the
first
one
to
be
clear,
his
position
is
that
he'd
rather
have
$1000
from
the
federal
court
and
$14,000
from
the
state
court,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
texas
is
of
a
great
state
but
it
hasn't
different
currency,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
on
your
view
of
the
diversity
statute,
a
removed
plaintiff
can
keep
a
litigation
--
keep
a
litigation
out
of
the
federal
court
by
making
a
different
monetary
claim
in
the
state
court
from
the
federal
court.
that's
what
you're
claiming.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
already
--
your
counterclaim
means
that
if
the
jurisdiction
is
decided
against
you
and
you'll
get
up
your
addendum
and
go
for
$14,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
not
entitled.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
clear
that
this
--
that
this
must
be
--
that
this
is
not
within
the
1958
limitation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
this
is
not
within
--
not
the
$10,000
but
it
isn't
the
subject
to
the
restriction
of
the
act
limiting
removal
in
workmen's
compensation
cases,
which
was
passed,
as
i
understand
it,
partly
in
response
to
the
clogged
business
of
the
fifth
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
claim
is,
conversely,
that
you
can
--
you
can
--
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction
act,
as
it
now
stand,
permits
you
to
cut
down
what
was
your
initial
claim
by
sending
it
on
--
on
what
the
board
allows
you
rather
what
you
claim,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
however
--
however,
plus
the
fact
that
if
this
case
goes
to
trial,
you
will
be
beyond
the
$10,000
limit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
did
you
didn't?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
did
you
didn't,
to
claim
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
shows
what
a
beautiful
thing
diversity
of
jurisdiction
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
he
already
attempt
the
exact
words
of
the
statute
referring
to
diversity
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
this
is
the
language
as
to
what
a
--
or
what
is
a
--
how
does
it
define
--
how
you
--
what
you
may
bring
a
suit
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
the
--
suppose
you
hadn't
counterclaim
subject
to
your
jurisdictional
resistance,
suppose
you
hadn't
counterclaim
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
prevailed,
that
is,
that
there
was
jurisdiction,
but
you
did
not
counterclaim
in
terms,
suppose
the
case
has
gone
back
to
the
district
court,
could
you
then,
after
it
got
that,
have
--
has
--
somehow
rather
putting
your
counterclaim,
would
you
been
foreclosed
after
litigation
started?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
you
could
have
been.
would
you
have
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
that
came
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
does
that
came
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
time
--
there
were
no
time
pressure,
could
you,
as
a
matter
of
right,
counterclaim
after
the
case
got
into
the
court,
into
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
take
all
the
question
of
statutes
of
--
statutes
of
limitation
whether
by
statute
or
state
law
or
rule
regarding
the
case,
what
i
want
to
know
is
this,
because
i
do
not
know,
i'm
ignorant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
got
the
rules
in
my
head.
could
you,
in
this
case,
assuming
the
district
court
will
grant
a
jurisdiction,
suppose
we
decided
it
had
jurisdiction,
could
you,
in
a
case
like
this,
put
statutes
of
limitation
aside,
counterclaim
beyond
the
amount
of
the
award
of
the
void?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
employee
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
and
the
amount
--
the
amount
up
to
which
he
could
counterclaim
although
he
didn't
counterclaim,
to
begin
with,
would
be
determined
by
state
law,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
assuming
--
putting
so
on
the
basis
of
what
you
tell
me
as
the
law,
whether
you
could
counterclaim
to
an
amount
beyond
$10,000
would
depend
upon
the
specific
facts
of
the
--
of
the
particular
litigation
but
not
the
federal
rules
of
federal
law,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
he
could
counterclaim
although
he
only
got
--
although
the
suit
is
merely
--
the
award
is
merely
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
much
lesser
amount.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
this
litigation
which
started,
forget
all
about
statutes
of
limitation,
i
don't
mean
that
they
wouldn't
be
bear
apart.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
this
suit
begun
in
the
district
court
for
an
amount
of
$1000
could
exceed
the
statutory
limit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you,
i'm
not
thinking
because
i'm
right
in
the
case.
i'm
just
thinking.
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
recalling,
i
may
well
be
wrong,
that
the
texas
--
that
volume
of
the
cases
that
got
into
the
federal
court
from
the
awards
of
your
board
was
explicitly
referred
to
in
making
the
amendment,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
--
have
got
--
do
you
do
you
quote
from
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
the
statistics.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
congress
or
the
report
bringing
in
this
--
this
limitation
referred
specifically
to
the
clogging
of
the
federal
court
in
texas
by
workmen's
compensation
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
to
--
to
disentangled
things
that
i
think
are
being
mixed
up.
no
secret
that
i
--
i'm
not
a
hot
part
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction.
but
while
we've
got
it,
i
don't
think
we
can
play
ducks
and
drakes
with
them.
in
the
first
place,
when
you
say
where
you
argue
abstain
that
although
their
jurisdiction
should
have
abstained,
you
must
have
in
mind
that
this
court
in
winter
haven
decided
just
the
opposite
but
the
court
can't
refuse
to
entertain
diversity
jurisdiction
because
it
seems
desirable
not
to
entertain
it.
so,
what
you're
asking
us
if
you
talk
about
abstention
would
be
to
overrule
winter
haven.
that's
number
one.
number
two,
what
i'd
like
to
know
is
that
when
congress
talked
about
original
suits
in
its
report,
withdrawing
removal,
did
it
mean
by
original
suits,
a
suit
like
this
in
which
there
is
a
de
novo
proceeding,
but
in
fact,
you're
reviewing
or
going
over
the
ground
and
indeed,
could
not
begin
a
suit
unless
you
first
went
to
your
board?
i
don't
know.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
know
both
from
you
and
from
respondent's
counsel
is
whether
on
this
senate
committee,
was
there
a
texas
lawyer
on
the
senate
committee
who
knew
the
nice
distinction
that
has
been
elucidated
here,
namely,
that
if
a
suit
de
novo
in
the
sense
that
you
can
try
out
everything
in
the
district
court
but
if
the
suit
de
novo
which
is
conditioned
on
a
prior
administrative
proceeding.
now,
all
those
things
have
been
taken
into
account
not
all
mixed
up
like
a
collage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you
are
really
urging,
as
i
understand
it,
is
although
congress
specifically
used
the
word
"removal",
even
what
is
normally
so
technical
term
as
removed
may,
in
the
context
of
the
whole
history
of
this
legislation
on
the
report,
have
a
broader
meaning,
namely,
anything
that
get
to
the
court
after
it
had
a
beginning
in
the
workmen's
compensation
board.
that's
really
what
you're
arguing,
on
that
phase?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
--
that's
a
different
thing.
but
if
you
rely
--
if
i
may
say
so,
you
argue,
in
the
first
place,
$1000
determines
the
amount
in
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
his
cause
of
action.
but
you
also
argue
on
the
other
part
of
the
1958
amendment,
namely,
that
although
congress
said
removal
of
workmen's
compensation
cases,
it
used
the
term
"removal"
not
with
nicety
with
reference
to
texas
law
and
legislation
but
in
the
law
in
a
looser
sense
anything
that
gets
into
court
after
it's
been
--
before
workmen's
compensation
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
aren't
there
some
states
in
which
the
employee
can
go
to
the
federal
courts
to
begin
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
begin
with
without
going
before
the
board
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore
--
so
therefore,
the
senate
report
to
that
extent
would
not
be
empty
--
empty
word
because
it
could
be
absorbed
by
or
be
allocated
to
states
in
which
that
is
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
i
should
think
that
works
both
ways
i
mean
and
the
--
the
respondent
will
deal
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
its
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
principle
is
concerned
with
--
with
texas,
then
presumably,
it
dealt
with
the
whole
texas
legislation
and
not
playing
these
--
these
professional
games.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
this
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
it
--
if
i
may
add,
there,
too,
on
the
theory
that
it
is
a
new
suit.
that
it's
a
new
suit
not
a
removal.
what
do
you
say
even
a
removal
suit
can
be
brought
transcend
beyond
--
that
you
may
even
remove
a
non-new
suit
in
the
federal
court
despite
this
new
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
in
--
what
you
say
--
when
you
say
that's
all
it
did,
let's
see
the
implication.
that
means
that
a
suit
began
in
the
federal
court
is
not
a
removal.
so
it
can't
be
deemed
a
removal
when
the
employer
fixed
to
go
into
the
federal
court.
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
and
therefore,
you
can
--
the
employee
can
go
into
the
federal
court
if
it's
more
than
$10,000
because
you
say
that
isn't
a
removal.
that's
an
original
suit
under
texas
law.
the
employee
--
if
--
if
the
employer
goes
into
the
federal
court
on
an
award
less
than
$10,000
for
the
employee,
you'll
resist
that
because
it
doesn't
meet
the
$10,000
requirement,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you've
also
said
to
me
earlier,
you
replied
earlier
that
if
you
go
into
the
federal
district
court
on
an
award
less
than
$10,000
and
say
nothing
and
not
object
to
the
jurisdiction,
forget
about
it
whether
the
court
should
raise
it,
say
nothing.
you
can
counterclaim
after
the
suit
has
begun
for
an
amount
less
than
$10,000,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you
can
get
in
to
the
district
court
then
--
then
the
litigation
would
be
for
more
than
$10,000
if
it's
potentially
more
than
$10,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
we're
here
--
the
petition
is
here
because
we're
trying
to
understand
this
and
see
whether
st.
paul
or
any
other
cases
are
correct.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what's
this
--
all
this
means
with
all
my
hostility
to
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
a
--
can
a
claimant
under
a
compensatory
statute
cut
down
the
amount
of
recovery
below
the
statutory
maximum?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
can't
--
if
he
does
that,
then
why
isn't
the
chief
justice's
question
controlling.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
says
the
statute
enables
me
if
this
is
tried
out
against
$14,000
but
i
think
an
honest
man
or
my
lawyer
having
shaking
me
down
on
what
really
happened
to
me,
can
only
claim
$8000.
is
he
allowed
to
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
any
event,
(inaudible)
case
put
by
the
chief
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
he
--
put
your
specific
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
can't
the
man
cut
down
his
claims?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
--
are
you
so
humanistic
in
texas
that
if
appellant's
(inaudible)
only
to
the
tune
of
$9000,
the
court
says
"oh,
no,
but
you
may
get
$14,000?"
i
believe
that's
the
thing
about
texas
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
that.[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
cobb,
the
chief
justice
gave
a
supposition
which
negative
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
--
i
don't
think
you
fully
comprehended
the
chief
justice's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
does
precisely
what
justice
whittaker
just
put
in
legal
terms,
namely,
he
formally
said,
"my
counterclaim
will
be
only
for
$9999."
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
state
that
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
by
statutory
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
limitation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet,
you
must
--
one
must
go
to
the
board
first,
isn't
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cobb.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
trying
to
understand
the
mysteries
of
texas
law
administration.
you
just
said
that
--
that
after
there
is
an
award,
no
matter
what
the
amount,
and
then
the
case
gets
into
the
court
either
state
or
federal,
the
fact
of
the
amount
of
the
award
can't
be
disclosed
in
the
--
in
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
how
can
--
how
can
the
court
know
that
it's
only
for
$1000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it
is
an
item
that
cannot
be
made
part
of
the
litigation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
which
--
for
which
the
suit
is
brought,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
be
an
award
but
it
can
be
$5
or
$15
or
$14,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
fact
is
not
made
part
of
the
record
of
the
proceedings
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
--
of
the
substantive
cause
of
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
--
where
is
your
pleading
by
which
you
began
the
suit
in
the
federal
court?
what
did
you
say
about
the
addendum
of
the
award?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
on
your
--
on
your
complaint,
you
simply
said
this
is
a
suit
under
texas
statute
and
diversity
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
texas
statute
allows
a
recovery
of
$14,000
on
concept
that
the
jury
would
bring
in
$14,000.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
chief
justice's
supposition
were
then
taking
up
by
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
whatever
it
is
in
which
they
say
we
disavow
an
amount
beyond
$9,000,
then
on
the
face
of
the
pleading,
and
you
don't
contradict
--
you
--
whether
--
that
would
be
controlling,
wouldn't
be?
that'd
be
a
judicial
admission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
$14,000.
he
claimed
$9,000,
then
you
say
the
court
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
ousted
of
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
--
yes,
certainly,
he
could.
forget
--
let's
forget
about
workmen's
compensation
or
any
diversity
case
on
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
the
contract
cost
for
whatever
it
is,
$25,000
adding
up
to
what
we're
recovering
--
potentially
covered
$25,000.
and
the
defendant
said,
"i
now
solemnly
say
that
the
outmost
of
any
jury
could
be
simply
be
fined
as
$9000
and
that's
all
i'm
going
to
ask
the
jury."
of
course,
he'd
be
thrown
out,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
there's
no
such
things
are
placed
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
how
you
can
keep
them
in
the
federal
court.
how
can
you
keep
them
if
you
say
i
now
bind
myself
to
not
want
more
than
$9000?
how
could
you
keep
them
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
you
could
keep
them
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
he
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
vendercreek.
i'd
like
to
ask
this
question.
in
--
what
is
on
the
plaintiff's
original
complaint,
the
insurance
case,
it
says
the
result
--
the
--
the
claim
the
sum
of
$14,000.
when
your
motion
to
dismiss,
you
say
that
the
award
of
$1050,
what
i
want
to
know
is
would
that
statement
of
the
award
find
any
place
if
the
case
went
to
trial
either
in
the
state
or
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
the
fact
--
i
didn't
make
my
question
clear.
would
the
fact
that
there
was
an
award
in
amount
of
$1050,
he
allowed
to
appear
in
the
litigation
even
in
the
state
or
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
fact
of
the
amount
would
not
appear
--
would
have
to
be
kept
out
of
the
litigation
in
the
court.
