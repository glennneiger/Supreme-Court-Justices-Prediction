mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
remove
the
--
could
they
remove
the
case
to
the
federal
courts,
your
case
in
the
--
in
the
state
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
you
rely
on
the
1958
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vandercreek.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vandercreek
what
is
--
what
language
in
the
legislative
history
more
clearly
than
any
other
shows
that
the
congress
had
in
mind
not
only
removal
but
the
filing
of
original
actions?(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cobb.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
the
petitioner
had
filed
a
counterclaim
for
$9999
instead
of
the
$14,000,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
will
make
no
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
act
--
your
action
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
your
action
in
the
federal
court,
was
it
filed
counterclaim
for
$9999?
would
the
district
court,
the
united
states
district
court
have
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
it's
under
the
--
that
would
bring
--
put
it
under
the
--
the
jurisdictional
amount
for
diversity
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
point
that
remained.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
if
all
he
was
seeking
in
--
in
that
court
was
less
than
$10,000
and
that
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
would
divest
the
--
the
court
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
please.
suppose
that
the
petitioner
have
--
have
beat
the
respondent
to
the
courts,
i
suppose
you've
gotten
to
the
county
courthouse
before
you
got
to
the
federal
court,
would
your
--
would
the
district
court
have
any
jurisdiction
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
couldn't
remove.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
the
--
so
you
think
it's
just
a
question
of
--
of
a
race
between
the
courthouse
and
the
federal
courts
to
determine
jurisdiction
in
this
manner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
went
off
and
passed
--
you
went
off
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
passed
the
very
same
day,
and
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
presume
you
did
it
for
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
to
beat
them
to
the
courthouse,
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.[laughter]
now
--
now,
let
me
ask
you
--
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
you
think
that
congress
when
it
passed
the
1958
law
intended
to
create
a
situation
of
that
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
--
would
you
say
that
--
that
the
intention
of
congress
was,
at
that
condition,
should
prevail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
we
are
--
we
are,
are
we
not,
trying
to
find
out
what
the
intention
of
congress
was
in
that
1958
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
of
those
900
were
filed
by
the
insurance
companies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
28.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
congress
said
that
it
--
it
intended
to
permit
employees
to
continue
to
have
that
freedom
of
choice,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
they
didn't
say
that
--
they
didn't
say
that
the
insurance
company
should
have
the
same
right
as
the
employee
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
cobb
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
quite
understand
because
you
say
this
is
an
original
action,
a
new
--
a
new
action.
it's
not
an
appeal
from
the
industrial
accident
board.
it's
a
new
--
it's
a
new
action.
now,
you
file
an
action
to
--
to
review
this
order
of
$1050
and
you
do
allege
in
your
complaint
that
such
an
order
was
made
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
that
extent,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
by
describing
the
amount.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
you
file
a
--
you
file
a
--
a
new
suit
in
the
--
in
the
federal
court.
and
--
is
the
issue
set
until
you
know
what
the
counterclaim
will
be
in
that
court?
and
if
he
files
$9,999,
isn't
that
the
thing
that
determines
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you're
--
you're
using
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
appeal
to
help
you
where
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
formally,
you
were
saying
this
without
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
an
independent
action
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
help
your
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
will
be
entitled
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
can
--
i
can
see
how
--
how
perhaps
the
man
wouldn't
be
permitted
to
reduce
his
--
his
claim
in
a
lawsuit
in
order
to
prevent
removal
where
he
had
once
claimed
more
than
$10,000.but
here,
you
say
that
it
--
it's
not
removal,
it's
a
brand
new
suit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
there,
shouldn't
he
be
entitled
to
claim
as
much
less
than
the
original
claim
as
he
wants
to
claim?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
be
there
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
he
would
be
there
for
less
than
the
jurisdiction
amount.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i
--
i
think
i
have
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
point,
mr.
--
i
won't
take
anymore
of
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
--
may
i
ask,
mr.
cobb,
i
promise
you
i
wouldn't
ask
you
anymore
questions
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i
just
want
to
--
i
just
want
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
get
this
in
my
mind.
suppose
you
file
this
suit
in
the
--
in
the
state
court
and
suppose
no
counterclaim
was
filed,
what
would
happen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
conceivable
of
the
man
might
be
satisfied
with
the
award
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
was
given
to
him
and
might
not
feel
it
necessary
or
to
file
a
counterclaim.
he
just
--
he
just
say
--
not
file
any.
now,
what
would
that
do
about
it?
would
--
would
he
--
would
they
still
be
opened
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
get
$14,000?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
a
lawsuit,
they
would
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
the
--
if
he
claimed
it
originally
before
the
board.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
now,
let's
take
it
in
your
--
in
--
in
this
case,
in
the
--
in
the
federal
court.
then
--
if
he
haven't
filed
the
$14,000
counterclaim,
would
he
still
had
been
entitled
to
$14,000
in
the
federal
court
if
the
facts
had
warranted
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do.
i
--
i
just
don't
know.
i
have
no
idea
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vandercreek.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
under
that
case
--
under
that
case,
he
must
file
a
counterclaim
for
anything
he
expects
to
get,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
in
the
texas
--
in
the
texas
courts,
could
a
man
say,
"i
--
i
lost
my
finger,
and
i'm
therefore
permanently
and
entirely
incapacitated,"
and
--
without
--
without
specifying
any
amount
of
--
of
damages
can
then
get
an
award?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
as
i
understood
mr.
cobb
that
in
those
circumstances,
if
the
award
was
less
than
the
$10,000,
the
federal
court
would
not
have
jurisdiction.
did
--
did
--
i
misunderstood
you,
did
i?
so
don't
--
don't
bother.
if
i
did
misunderstand
you,
that's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
could
go.
you
may
ask.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
anything?
and
--
and
there
is
no
permanent
and
--
and
total
disability
claimed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
no
total
and
permanent
disability
is
claimed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
