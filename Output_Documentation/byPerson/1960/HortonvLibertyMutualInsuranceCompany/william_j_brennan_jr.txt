justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
--
let's
see.
suppose
review
had
been
sought
in
a
state
court,
mr.
tonahill,
instead
of
this
action
would
be
brought
to
federal
district
court,
what
form
will
it
take?
a
new
action
in
the
state
court
or
would
it
had
been
an
appeal
to
some
--
one
of
the
state
courts
from
the
judgment
of
the
workmen's
compensation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
--
a
suit
filed
within
20
days
thereafter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
that
require
a
pleading
under
texas
practice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
form,
it
looks
like
a
--
a
new
original
action,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is,
nevertheless,
under
your
practice,
that's
an
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
does
notice
of
appeal
to
mean?
was
it
that?
i
appeal
from
a
competent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
his
appeal
has
to
be,
i
might
be
clear
about
this,
his
appeal,
so
named
is,
in
fact,
an
original
complaint
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
in
what
--
so
what
state
court
does
it
go
with
that
original
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
court
do
they
go
to
then
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
trying
to
get
back
to
the
state
court.
in
your
state
--
what
happened
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
went
to
the
state
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
went
to
the
--
what
state
court
did
you
go?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
county
--
to
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
claim
something
in
excess
of
$1000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
and
then
what
happened?
what
did
the
respondent
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
instead
of
going
to
any
state
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
they
could
have
gone
to
the
state
court
because
the
amount
was
$1050,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
it's
$1050.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
$50
over
the
jurisdictional
limit
of
the
county
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
only
if
you
counterclaim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
jury
trial
in
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
justice
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
in
justice
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
tonahill,
now
you
said
a
removed
plaintiff.
i
gather
--
i
thought
you
told
us
that
what
happened
here
was
not
that
the
respondent
removed
but
that
the
respondent
ordered
original
action
in
the
federal
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
review
or
rather
--
if
that's
the
right
word,
in
any
event,
they
get
to
set
aside
the
$10,050
award
maybe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
is
not
a
removed
action
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
with
--
your
point
is
they're
trying
to
get
around
the
restriction
of
that
statute
against
removal
by
starting
an
original
action
and
lifting
cells
by
the
wrong
bootstraps
by
relying
in
your
$14,000
counterclaim
to
keep
jurisdiction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
on
your
claim
before
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i
understand
on
your
counterclaim,
if
you
can
win
on
your
motion
to
dismiss
to
get
that
out
of
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
vandercreek,
if
instead
of
a
$10,050
award,
you
had
a
$10,500
award,
would
you
have
the
like
to
stand
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
find
the
same
jury
on
texas
supreme
court.
didn't
it
say
that
the
suit
was
set
aside
and
award
is
in
fact
a
suit
not
an
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
appeal
then
isn't
it?
well,
tell
me
this
though,
i
--
you
just
said
that
even
if
it
were
a
$10,500
award
you'd
still
be
here,
and
one
of
the
reasons
you
suggest
was
that
the
congress
intended
the
district
courts
to
abstain
exercise
in
jurisdiction
even
in
those
cases,
is
there
any
--
any
history
to
that
effect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
tell
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
concerning
the
increase
from
$3000
to
$10,000
which
indicated
that
that
increase
was
made
in
part
to
keep
out
of
federal
court's
original
actions
of
this
kind
from
texas
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
there
specific
reference
or
expressed
reference
rather
to
the
problem
in
texas
and
louisiana
has
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
amount
was
increased
from
$3000
to
$10,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
--
this
is
related
--
i
mean,
this
table
at
page
5a
of
your
appendix
to
your
brief,
is
--
is
this
only
of
cases
--
now,
it's
not
only
a
removed
cases,
is
it?
it
also
has
a
table
where
--
of
original
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
the
--
the
prohibition
against
removal
couldn't
have
affected
the
original
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
these
original
actions
then
are
employees,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
statistics
don't
show
that.
this
indicates
that
the
defendant
most
of
the
time
brought
the
original
action.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i'm
probably
wrong.
justice
stewart
points
out
that
--
these
figures
at
5a,
this
indicates
the
insurance
company
was
the
defendant
with
435
suits,
the
plaintiff
with
only
10,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
that
reason,
i
gather,
you're
not
making
any
argument
to
us
that
this
judicial
proceeding
is,
in
effect,
the
removal
of
the
state
board's
administrative
(inaudible),
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you're
resting
entirely
on
this,
not
on
the
section
which
--
of
the
new
legislation
in
which
bars
removal
to
the
federal
court.
but
on
the
increase
of
jurisdiction
of
$10,000,
your
argument
is
that
this
complaint
determines
the
jurisdictional
amount
of
not
less
than
$10,000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
cobb,
when
one
goes
in
your
administrative
agency
with
a
claim
for
workmen's
compensation,
is
it
often
that
the
claimant
asks
for
less
than
the
$14,035?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
kind
of
case
where
the
--
i
--
i've
--
we've
--
mr.
tonahill
said
that
$14,035
is
the
maximum
that
may
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
obtained
under
this
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
kind
of
case
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
total
permanent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
the
one
removed
was
a
finger
or
an
arm
or
a
leg,
it
might
be
for
some
less
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
you
--
i
see.
except
on
those
two
instances
then,
you
would
have
no
basis
for
going
into
the
federal
court
on
your
theory
that
it's
the
amount
of
claim
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
rather
than
the
amount
of
award.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
any
large
amount
of
cases
where
either
death
or
there
were
no
statistics?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
be
candidly
in
all
jury
trial,
civil
juries.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
obviously
follows
that
the
award
set
aside,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
you
haven't
vacated,
set
aside,
voided
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
declared
to
be
at
most
further
force
and
effect.
i
can't
imagine.
if
you
got
that
and
that
certainly
takes
nothing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
happens
in
your
state
practice
if
--
if
he
is
satisfied
with
the
board's
award
and
the
carrier
is
not,
and
you
take
an
appeal
to
carry
or
place
an
appeal
to
the
state
court,
does
this
reopen
the
whole
amount
more
than
the
$1050
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
he
offers
no
--
nothing
more
than
the
evidence
that
was
often
before
the
board,
yet
if
they
come
along,
the
jury
comes
along
with
$5000
instead
of
$1050,
this
is
the
risk
you
take,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
get
any
compensation
or
anything
in
excess
of
the
award?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
what
happened
in
this
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
happened
in

you
cited

truly
well

william
j.
brennan,

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
this
--
take
nothing,
why
would
take
nothing?
not
even
the
$300?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and

and
he
wasn't
allowed
to
present
his

his
claim
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
mean
he
was
not
allowed
to
offer
his
evidence
in
the
county
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
because
he
had
not
filed
a
counterclaim,
is
that
it?
justice
william

because

justice
william
j.
brennan,

may
i
ask
you,
mr.
vandercreek,
before
you
sit
down?
i
understood
mr.
cobb
to
say
that
the
number
of

of
petitions,
if
that's
the
right
style
for
compensation
in
which
something
in
excess
of
$10,000
is
sought
is
a
small
portion
of
the
total
number
compensation
claims,
this
is
--
excluding
death
actions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
there
