when
you
say
"appeal",
do
you
mean
appeal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
said
the
highest
amount
that
is
claimed,
did
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
claimed
in
what?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
he
claims
for
compensation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
sir?
under
your
state
law
on
such
a
proceeding
whether
it
be
called
an
appeal
or
a
plenary
suit,
what
determines
the
amount
in
controversy,
is
it
the
amount
awarded
by
the
commission
or
the
amount
claimed
by
the
employee?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
from
a
claimed
award.

charles

whittaker
the
trouble
is
the
uncertainty
at
least
rises,
does
it
not,
from
the
fact
that
those
references
were
all
to
the
congestions
caused
by
removals?
and
congress
dealt
in
the
1958th
act
only
with
the
prohibition
of
the
removal
of
such
cases
and
did
not
close
the
gate
against
the
bringing
of
plenary
suits.

(inaudible)
the
district
court
of
the
united
states.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
all
what
it
is.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that's
what
congress
did.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
this
the
answer
to
that?
until
he
does
file
a
counterclaim
for
an
amount
less
than
the
$10,000
in
the
federal
court
under
the
booth
case,
the
amount
made
in
the
claim
must
stand
for
the
amount,
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
not
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
many
situations
try
to
remove
cases
from
federal
court.
plaintiff
didn't
like
it,
files
a
remittitur,
attempts
to
dismiss,
you
can't
do
that
with
files
in
remittitur
claim
in
less
than
the
--
the
jurisdictional
amount
but
the
cases
say
that
once
the
jurisdiction
is
vested
properly,
it's
there
to
the
end
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
i
understand
it,
if
it's
a
trial
de
novo
in
either
court,
then
all
is
open.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
whatever
amount,
if
any,
the
evidence
sustained
is
the
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
it
could
be
all
away
from
nothing
up
to
the
amount
stated
in
the
claim
of
$14,000.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
either
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
this
could
be
so
whether
the
redress
was
sought,
the
suit
we
brought
either
by
the
claimant
or
by
the
employer.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
that
is
not
so,
it's
not
a
de
novo
proceeding.
