mr.
howell
cobb
may
it
please
the
court.
the
contention
of
the
respondent
here
is
that
when
horton
filed
his
claim
before
the
--
before
the
industrial
accident
board
of
texas,
he
claimed
that
the
respondent
owed
him
$14,035.
the
board
did
not
agree
with
it.
the
texas
supreme
court
has
held
that
when
a
--
injured
workman
may
--
what
would
--
would
ordinarily
call
a
plaintiff
with
the
employee
claims
that
the
insurance
company
owes
him
compensation,
if
the
amount
he
claims
before
that
board
sets
the
pecuniary
value
of
the
matter
at
issue.
that
was
squarely
held
in
this
booth
versus
texas
employers.
it
--
it
held
there
that
the
amount
--
when
the
claim
with
the
board
shows
the
amount
claimed
in
dollars
and
cents
or
by
a
statement
or
facts
which
the
amount
can
definitely
be
determined
in
the
award
of
the
board
is
less
than
the
amount
of
the
claim,
then
the
amount
shown
by
the
claim
is
the
amount
in
controversy.
as
booth
versus
texas
employers,
it's
a
supreme
court
of
texas
case,
our
position
is
that
horton's
rights
such
he
has
to
compensation
are
set
up
by
the
texas
--
the
texas
workmen's
compensation
act
and
what
the
supreme
court
says
he
is
entitled
to
is
what
the
value
in
controversy
or
the
--
subject
to
controversy
here.
that
because
the
supreme
court
of
texas
holds
this
$14,000,
that
is
the
liability
that
we
are
being
exposed
to.
that
when
the
board
awards
any
award
against
us,
that
the
amount
of
our
potential
liability
is
that
$14,000
and
our
suit
to
set
aside
the
award
is
what
it's
called.
it's
not
an
appeal.
the
statutes
call
it
a
suit
to
set
aside
the
award.
but
what
is
really
involved
is
what
horton
is
claiming.
we
--
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
on
the
number
of
specific
injuries
and
things
of
that
sort
it's
--
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
that
is
total
and
permanent
disability.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
oh,
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
only
--
the
--
there
are
only
two
awards
under
the
texas
compensation
act
that
can
be
in
excess
of
$10,000.
that's
a
death
action
and
total
and
permanent
disability.
now,
anything
less
than
that
would
be
less
than
--
award
less
than
$10,000,
any
claim
of
any
other
injuries.
mr.
howell
cobb
that
--
that
is
true.
mr.
howell
cobb
only
in
a
death
action
in
which
the
award
is
12
--
over
$12,000
and
award
of
total
and
permanent
disability
where
it
claimed
a
total
and
permanent
disability.
those
are
the
only
two.
all
other
injuries
would
--
would
result
in
a
monetary
value
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howell
cobb
i
do
not
know.
i
imagine
that
the
death
case
is
very
small
in
-
in
consideration
of
all
of
the
claims
made,
and
i
imagine
the
total
permanent
claims
and
awards
are
less
than
loss
of
fingers,
arm
or
legs
or
that
sort.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
think
so
because
my
--
mr.
howell
cobb
on
the
original
action,
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
howell
cobb
that
--
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
so,
your
honor,
because
the
texas
statute
says
that
if
the
final
order
or
award
of
the
board
is
against
the
association
which
they
mean
the
insurance
carrier,
then
the
association
and
not
the
employer
shall
bring
suit
to
set
aside
and
set
final
ruling
and
decision
if
it
desires.
and
the
court
shall,
in
either
event,
determine
the
issues
in
such
cause
instead
of
the
board
upon
trial
de
novo
and
the
burden
of
proof
shall
rest
upon
the
party
claiming
compensation.
so
whichever
side
takes
a
compensation
claim
to
the
court,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
employee.
now
--
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
i
--
i
don't
think
so,
if
your
honor
please,
because
the
--
under
the
--
the
interpretation
of
the
texas
statute,
what
is
involved
is
what
the
claimant
claims
he
is
entitled
to
under
the
claim
filed
with
the
board.
he
and
either
party
appealed
the
burden
of
proof
is
still
on
the
employee
to
maintain
that
claim.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
because
--
mr.
howell
cobb
in
--
in
this
case,
he
could
be,
yes,
sir.
if
--
if
this
claim
--
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
he
would
asked
about
lawsuit,
and
i
--
i
feel
--
mr.
howell
cobb
alright,
sir,
if
the
claim
that
he
made
was
vague
and
indefinite
before
the
board
and
could
not
be
determined,
yes,
sir.
we
would
not
be
here.
but
in
a
case
where
the
supreme
court
says
that
the
amount
in
controversy
between
the
parties
of
supreme
court
of
texas
says
that
the
amount
in
controversy
between
the
party
is
what
the
employee
claims
before
the
board.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
sir?
mr.
howell
cobb
sir?
mr.
howell
cobb
yes.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir
and
he
can
--
and
he
can
go
to
file
on
that.
he
--
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
the
--
maybe
i
miss
the
point
completely.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
howell
cobb
then
--
then
i
--
mr.
howell
cobb
then
after
--
then
after
that
point,
if
he
abandons
the
rest
of
his
claim,
then
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
howell
cobb
alright,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
but
the
--
at
--
at
that
time
yes,
sir.
but
when
it
was
originally
brought
and
when
the
liability
was
in
excess
of
$10,000,
i
think
that
they
had
jurisdiction
up
until
the
time
the
counterclaim
for
less
than
that
was
filed.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
it
would
be
a
judicial
mission
that
he
wouldn't
entitle
to
more
than
the
--
the
supreme
--
than
the
jurisdictional
amount.
mr.
howell
cobb
the
--
the
united
states
district
court?
mr.
howell
cobb
no,
sir.
we
--
we
could
not
remove
the
case.
mr.
howell
cobb
and
--
and
second
reason
is
that
when
the
award
is
appealed
from,
it's
vacated
and
then
there's
nothing
left
for
us
to
find
and
file
a
lawsuit
in
the
federal
court.
he
is
there
--
he
is
there,
and
we've
prevented
from
removal,
and
there
is
no
award
to
appeal
from.
mr.
howell
cobb
no,
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
a
race,
your
honor.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
don't
--
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
they
could
have
prevented
it,
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
feel
that
they
did
prevent
it.
they
could
have
said
or
file.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
do
not
know,
sir.
i
doubt
that
they
would
want
to
create
a
situation
where
there
would
be
races
to
the
courthouse.
however
--
nevertheless,
if
we
are
entitled
to
file
a
direct
action
in
the
--
in
the
federal
court
regardless
of
whether
they
are
entitled
to
file
one
in
the
state
court,
i
don't
think
the
time
element
is
necessarily
controlling
if
we
are,
in
fact,
entitled
under
the
diversity
jurisdiction
to
file
a
lawsuit.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
and
i
believe
that
they
knew
at
the
time
that
it
was
enacted
that
they
were
about
1100
of
these
lawsuits
removed
every
year
and
about
900
of
them
file
directly.
and
they
did
not
bar
the
filing
of
any
of
them.
and
the
employee
can
still,
if
he
desires
to,
file
900
of
these
cases
in
texas
every
year.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
28.
mr.
howell
cobb
i'm
sorry,
sir,
25
out
of
982.
25
were
filled
by
the
insurance
company.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir,
but
--
yes,
sir.
they
also
knew
at
the
same
time
that
there
were
25
out
of
these
2000
lawsuits
that
were
being
filed
by
insurance
companies
as
plaintiffs
to
appeal
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
from
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
howell
cobb
no,
sir.
they
didn't
say
that
they
should
but
they
recognized
that
they
did
previously
have
the
right
and
then
they
didn't
subsequently
bar
them
by
saying,
"a
defendant
or
an
insurer
cannot
remove
a
case"
and
they
could
have
said,
"or
filed."
but
they
knew
at
same
time
that
25
out
of
these
2000
lawsuits
were
being
filled
as
plaintiffs
by
--
directed
by
insurance
companies.
the
--
the
award
of
the
board
or
to
talk
about
an
appeal
this
is,
in
fact,
a
--
a
new
lawsuit,
it's
an
original
action.
the
proceed
--
any
of
the
proceedings
before
the
industrial
accident
board
even
the
award
of
the
board
is
not
admissible
in
evidence,
it's
not
reviewed
and
to
introduce
the
award
as
reversible
error.
it
is
strictly
a
new
lawsuit.
it
is
a
lawsuit
in
which
--
mr.
howell
cobb
the
award
of
the
industrial
accident
board
or
any
of
the
proceedings
before
the
industrial
accident
board
are
not
admissible
in
this
lawsuit,
it's
filed
in
which
the
--
mr.
howell
cobb
statutory
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
statutory
and
by
case
law
and
--
and
in
any
introduction
of
the
award
of
the
board.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
one
must
file
a
claim
before
the
board.
and
then
if
the
award
is
even
introduced
in
evidence,
its
reversible
error
to
introduce
that
award.
so
that
the
--
the
--
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir,
on
all
issues
of
fact.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
it's
half
true,
the
house,
its
10-to-2.
i
believe
now,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
in
--
in
two
courts,
yes,
sir,
the
county
court
and
the
justice
court.
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
you
--
i
think
you
still
don't
do
until
the
state
senate
passes
it
which
they
haven't
done
yet.
it
passed
the
house
but
not
the
senate.
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
it's
--
it
is
still
unanimous
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
your
honor,
but
there
is
a
bill
pending
at
the
house
to
pass
to
make
it
10-to-2.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
may
be
--
may
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
it
cannot
be
disclosed
to
the
jury
is
what
i
mean.
of
course,
it's
--
mr.
howell
cobb
that
--
mr.
howell
cobb
that
is
right.
and
yet,
it
is
a
necessary
step
in
the
bringing
of
this
suit.
in
other
words,
it
has
to
be
an
award
until
there
is
no
award
--
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
no,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
no,
sir.
the
amount
of
the
award
is
neither
pled
nor
approved.
the
only
thing
that's
pled
or
approved
is
an
award
was
made.
the
amount
of
it
is
not
admissible
in
evidence
and
if
the
--
if
one
party
or
the
other
files
a
pleading,
it
can
be
stating
that
the
award
was
zero
or
$14,000.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
said
that
--
that
he
was
asserting
a
claim
against
us
that
we
desired
to
set
aside
--
it
was
a
formal
as
--
its
on
page
1
of
the
record.
in
page
3,
in
--
at
paragraph
(4),
i
say
that
the
amount
of
--
in
controversy
as
claimed
by
the
defendant
in
which
the
defendant,
which
was
the
employee,
claimed
before
the
board
was
$14,000
which
is
a
claimed
liability
against
us.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
because
when
--
when
i
appealed,
the
burden
of
proof
is
still
on
him
and
he
is
allowed
to
--
i
mean
he
has
burden
of
going
forward
and
he
is
still
allowed
to
recover
anything
that
he
is
claiming.
and
the
award
is
not
even
admissible,
it's
not
--
if
it's
pled,
it
can
be
stricken.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
once
he
comes
in
and
answers
and
said,
"no,
we
don't
claim
$14,000."
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
--
mr.
howell
cobb
would
--
would
that
be
--
would
not
--
would
that
be
the
case
in
a
--
in
a
suit
that
i'm
brining
for
an
excess
of
$10,000?
or
--
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
could
you
not
judicially
--
a
plaintiff
judicially
admit
himself
out
of
federal
jurisdiction?
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
it
would
be
judicial
admission
if
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
the
person
claiming
--
claiming
the
amount
of
$14,000
later
says
"no,
i'm
--
mr.
howell
cobb
no,
sir.
he
--
he
cross
it
for
$14,035
just
to
see
a
claime
before
the
industrial
accident
board.
and
six
days
later,
they
filed
a
suit
in
orange
county,
texas
for
$14,000
for
the
same
amount.
mr.
howell
cobb
so
--
mr.
howell
cobb
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
either,
your
honor.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
know
in
--
mr.
howell
cobb
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
know
this
is
true
in
land
cases,
your
honor,
that
if
--
mr.
howell
cobb
then
i
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
then
i
was
wrong
when
i
answered
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
that
counterclaim
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
if
that
is
correct.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes.
mr.
howell
cobb
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
it
is
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
jurisdictional
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
but
then
an
order
has
been
made.
i
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
describe
the
amount.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
actually,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
of
--
of
the
holding
in
the
supreme
court
of
texas
that
the
amount
involved
--
that
really
what
this
is
--
what
do
you
call
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
an
appeal
is
a
right
of
the
employee
to
compensation.
mr.
howell
cobb
and
what
sets
his
right
to
how
much
compensation
is
the
claim
that
he
files.
and
then
regardless
of
which
party
appeals,
i
mean,
it
--
it
doesn't
matter
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
upon
suit
--
mr.
howell
cobb
alright,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
well
--
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
actually,
sir
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
we
--
we
all
--
i
mean,
the
lawyers,
they
call
it
an
appeal.
actually,
the
statute
never
talks
of
an
appeal.
it
calls
of
--
before
a
suit.
we
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
but
you
have
to
give
notice
not
of
--
of
appeal
but
of
intention
to
rather
a
dissatisfaction
with
the
awards.
but
we
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
call
it
by
shorthand
appeals.
mr.
howell
cobb
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
suit
and
when
such
a
suit
is
brought
to
set
aside,
as
the
statute
calls,
the
award
of
the
--
or
the
ruling
of
the
board,
the
burden
of
proof
is
--
i
mean,
on
the
claimant,
that
is
the
employee,
regardless
of
who
gets
in
as
a
nominal
plaintiff
would
offend.
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
claimant
to
assert
and
prove
his
claim.
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
texas
has
stated,
the
amount
of
the
claim
go
on
the
compensation
that
he
is
entitled
to
in
such
a
suit
regardless
of
who
files
the
suit
is
how
much
he
claim
before
that
board.
if
he
claimed
it
less,
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
less
in
such
a
suit.
mr.
howell
cobb
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
anymore
than
he
claimed
before
the
industrial
accident
board.
if
he
claims
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
a
loss
of
--
loss
of
use
of
a
little
finger,
he
could
not
then
come
in
and
--
and
claim
total
permanent
disability
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
on
such
an
appeal.
but
when
he
claims
total
permanent
disability
or
$14,000
before
the
board,
and
some
award
is
entered
and
a
suit
to
set
it
aside
has
made,
then
the
burden
is
on
--
on
the
plaintiff
regardless
of
who
brings
that
suit
in
court
to
prove
his
right
to
compensation
and
the
amount
that
he
is
entitled
to
recover,
he
is
set
by
his
--
set
and
fixed
by
the
filing
of
his
claim
before
that
board.
and
the
award
never
thereafter
enters
to
it.
that's
why
i
feel
that
the
petitioner's
position
that
--
that
we're
merely
seeking
to
escape
liability
of
$1050
award
is
--
is
not
true
because
we
are
seeking
to
escape
responsibility
for
the
claim
or
so
much
is
he
entitled
to
$14,000
because
once
this
suit
is
brought,
that
award
has
no
place
in
it.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
no
more
than
it
--
it's
still
a
granting
suit
when
the
employee
brings
it
in
federal
court
which
he
is
allowed
to
do.
and
if
he
brings
it
for
$14,000
and
we
join
issue
on
that.
mr.
howell
cobb
and
then
he
later
attempts
and
say,
"i
made
a
mistake
in
--
in
claiming
$14,000.
i
now
want
to
claim
$9000
or
$5000.
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
oust
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
i
think
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
it's
the
same
situation
here,
where
we
are
seeking
to
relieve
ourselves
of
liability
not
for
$1000
but
$14,000.
now,
he
comes
in
and
says,
"no,
i
--
i
really
only
want
$9999."
i
think
you
would
have
to
dismiss
or
counterclaim
or
--
we
would
have
to
--
how
would
that
be?
he
would
or
he'd
just
be
there.
[laughter]
he
would
just
be
there.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
i
make
it
a
one
--
if
once
he
filed
his
claim,
he
attaches
this
to
what
the
issue
between
theses
two
parties.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
$14,050
would
--
mr.
howell
cobb
but
--
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
not
only
the
award
but
that
he
take
nothing
by
his
claim,
then
he
take
nothing.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
and
that
he
take
--
and
--
and
plaintiff
further
phrased
that
defendant
take
nothing
out
and
from
the
plaintiff.
mr.
howell
cobb
[laughs]
mr.
howell
cobb
the
award
could
be
set
aside
and
he
could
--
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
often
not.
mr.
howell
cobb
well,
if
it
--
he
is
still
entitled
to
recover
some
amount
of
money
under
his
claim,
more
or
less
than
the
award,
the
award
is
just
a
jurisdictional
step
in
--
in
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
just
like
the
occurrence
of
the
accident
as
a
jurisdictional
step.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
up
to
the
amount
that
he
may
claim.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
he
is
bound
by
the
claim
that
he
files
but
not
by
the
evidence
the
order
--
award
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
of
the
board
but
by
the
claim
that
he
filed.
and
since
he
is
bound
by
it,
we
feel
that
that's
what
attaches
the
amount
in
--
between
the
two
courts.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
it
was
total
permanent,
$14,035.
and
our
alternative
position,
we
think
that
jurisdiction
attached
with
the
filing
of
the
petition
but
in
the
event
it
didn't,
he
affirmatively
cross-action
for
that
amount
of
money
calling
it
subject
to
dismiss
but
he
sought
relief
to
the
court
not
for
any
lesser
amount
than
what
he
claimed
before
the
board
and
claimed
in
a
subsequent
suit
in
the
state
court.
mr.
howell
cobb
alright.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
hope
--
mr.
howell
cobb
when
we
tried
it
with,
as
i
understand
it,
that
--
your
honor
as
far
as
i
know
this
never
happen
but
--
because
once
--
one
of
these
insurers'
appeals,
a
cross-action
is
then
filed.
but
if
that
happen,
as
i
understand
it,
the
claim
would
be
litigated
and
the
burden
of
proof
would
be
on
the
--
the
employee
to
establish
the
extent
and
duration
of
his
interest.
that
is
my
understanding
of
it.
but
the
form
of
--
mr.
howell
cobb
i
would
--
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
in
trying
--
mr.
howell
cobb
if
they
lose
it,
i
think
so,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
if
they
loss
it,
they
would
be.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
so
if
he
claim
that.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
so
and
--
mr.
howell
cobb
--
then
a
suit
bring
it
aside
was
--
was
brought.
i
think
so.
as
a
practical
manner,
they
always
file
a
cross-action.
mr.
howell
cobb
i
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
because
--
because
he
claimed
that
same
total
permanent
disability
before
the
state
board,
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
were
seeking
to
relieve
our
liability
act.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
and
the
board's
award
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
regardless
of
who
appealed.
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir,
state
or
federal.
yes,
sir.
mr.
howell
cobb
that's
my
understanding
of
it
because
of
the
--
the
whole
purpose
of
the
suit,
so-called,
to
set
aside
the
award
is
to
review
how
much
compensation
the
claimant
is
entitled
to
within
the
scope
of
the
claim
that
he
made.
mr.
howell
cobb
that
is
right,
sir.
and
it
is
completely
de
novo.
for
those
--
those
reasons
and
further
of
the
alternative
reason
that
he
affirmatively
sought
$14,000
in
his
counterclaim,
we
feel
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
howell
cobb
(inaudible)
mr.
howell
cobb
i
--
i
meant
the
claim
amount
there
if,
for
specific
injury,
let
anything
less
than
total
and
permanent
disability
or
death.
in
other
words,
any
claims
may,
or
any
specific
injury,
such
as
the
loss
of
a
leg
or
--
mr.
howell
cobb
thank
you.
mr.
howell
cobb
sir?
mr.
howell
cobb
yes,
sir.
he's
claiming
the
loss
of
a
leg
which
is
$7000
that
is
the
maximum
recovery.
