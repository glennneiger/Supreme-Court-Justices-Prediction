(inaudible)
position
of
the
lower
court
that
it
was
to
be
performed
ashore,
what
you
have
to
attack
is
that
the
duty
to
provide
cure
wasn't
satisfied
because
the
opinion
as
i
read
it
below
rests
on
the
composition
that
the
contract
followed
the
satisfactory
of
the
obligation
to
provide
cure
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
what
you
have
started
out
was
--
and
seems
to
me
to
be
the
gravamen
of
the
case
namely
that
did
not
satisfy
the
requirement
of
the
cure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
money
is
a
vital
thing
but,
to
pay
money
and
--
but
go
on
read
the
rest
of
it.
it
clearly
said
that
the
obligation
to
provide
cure
satisfy
--
i
take
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
another
point.
if
that
is
right,
if
there
was
a
satisfaction
of
the
duty
to
provide
cure,
then
this
is
a
subsidiary
thing
that
the
--
they
said
whether
--
whether
the
old
case
in
248
is
still
valid
or
not,
it's
a
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
never
have
that
difficulty
mr.
rassner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although
the
provision
that
preceded
it,
satisfied
the
requirement
of
case,
is
that
right?
is
that
the
difficulty
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
but
that's
a
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
we'll
take
that
assumption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
then
--
then,
the
contact
nevertheless
is
a
maritime
contract
outside
of
the
so-called
of
new
york
authority,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
--
maybe
so
but
it
isn't
erickson
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
the
real
gravamen
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
argument
is
over
when
you
say
i
think
it's
maritime
where
the
state
law
can
apply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
stating
it
again
why
there
is
no
question
of
cure?
would
you
mind
stating
it
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understand,
that
is
a
challenge
isn't
it
mr.
underwood?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
on
the
merits
whether
making
appropriate
provision
for
his
entering
--
entering
into
then
marine
hospital,
does
that
take
care
of
the
obligation
to
furnish
cure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
as
i
understood
you,
a
minute
ago
in
answering
mr.
whittaker,
you
said
the
discontinuance
of
the
second
account
was
a
discontinuance
of
claims
for
maintenance
and
cure.
did
i
understand
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
i
understand
the
--
judge
magruder's
opinion,
he
said
you
can't
--
didn't
deal
with
maintenance
and
cure
but
just
deal
maintenance.
the
cure
point
is
--
your
cure
point
relies
on
judge
hawkes'
opinion
in
barker,
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
was
cited
in
--
which
was
cited
in
(inaudible)
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
cure
point
is
definitely
by
judge
hawkes
in
barker
and
the
maintenance
point
insofar
as
it
is
dealt
with,
it
dealt
with
by
the
discontinuance
without
the
prejudice
of
the
second
count.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
what
justice
magruder
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
judge
magruder
took
it
distributively
or
not
conjunctively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
has
happened
to
erickson
since
it
was
decided?
naturally
i
don't
think
anything
has
happened
in
1919
is
in
the
middle
ages
but
it
is
usually
called
old
in
old
case.
what
has
happened
to
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
really
the
--
that
was
an
agreement
for
employment
as
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
local
variation
certainly
would
not
be
tolerated
as
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow
that's
not
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
maritime
law
regarding
the
subject
matter
of
what
the
statute
of
frauds
deals
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
if
there
any
ill
consequences
of
discharging
his
duty
by
way
of
a
public
health
hospital
be
left
to
the
local
law
authority,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
here,
what
you
were
arguing
here
is
that
this
agreement
is
really
an
agreement
to
deal
with
those
consequences
which
without
agreements
would
be
left
to
the
local
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
if
there
is
incompetence
on
the
part
of
surgeon,
