mr.
jacob
rassner
mr.
chief
justice,
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
the
question
upon
which
we
seek
instruction
is
just
to
what
extent
a
ship
owner
owes
a
seaman
the
duty
of
maintenance
and
cure
and
whether
or
not
the
obligation
may
be
terminated
or
delegated.
the
court
below
has
held
that
a
ship
owner's
obligation
to
treat
its
sick
or
injured
seamen
is
delegable
by
the
expediency
or
by
the
method
of
tendering
to
a
seaman
a
so
called
master
certificate
which
is
a
paper
signed
by
what
the
master,
or
one
of
the
other
officers,
notifying
a
marine
hospital
that
the
bearer
of
that
paper
is
eligible
for
treatment.
we
hold
that
such
decision
is
contrary
to
the
authorities
treating
with
the
subject.
we
believe
that
a
ship
owner's
obligation
for
maintenance
and
cure
just
does
not
ceased
by
a
mere
tender
of
a
piece
of
paper
nor
that
they
can
delegate
it
by
saying
to
somebody
else,
a
marine
hospital,
“gentlemen,
this
is
your
problem
from
here
on.
we've
given
a
piece
of
paper
to
our
seaman.
we
wash
our
hands
of
further
obligation.
it's
your
duty.”
another
question
which
i
think
has
been
met
and
discussed
many
times
by
judge
learned
hand
as
i've
pointed
out
in
my
brief
and
i
do
not
intend
to
repeat
that
which
i
have
covered
in
the
brief
and
by
this
court
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
a
maritime
composition,
state
law
will
not
be
permitted
to
alter,
diminish
or
abolish
the
rights
given
to
seamen.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
seamen
now
being
represented
by
unions
and
they
do
not
need
the
protection
of
the
courts
as
wards
of
the
court.
but
realistically
and
based
on
over
35
years
of
experience,
i
still
consider
them
as
just
big
overgrown
boys,
children,
they
need
protection
now
just
as
much
as
years
ago.
they
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
the
plaintiff,
the
petitioner
here
was
a
chief
steward
working
for
the
united
fruit
line.
he
had
a
goiter.
he
had
an
illness
and
he
retained
dr.
fricke
as
his
surgeon
to
treat
it.
he
had
had
some
experience
with
the
marine
hospital
and
was
fearful
of
going
back
not
knowing
whether
he'd
get
internist,
a
learner,
a
student
or
some
experienced
doctor
to
treat
him.
he'd
had
some
minor
ailments
in
the
past
and
was
quite
fearful.
he
went
to
the
united
fruit
line
and
said
i
will
pay
for
my
own
doctor.
i've
already
retained
him
and
i
set
forth
the
names
of
the
people
in
debates
in
the
amended
complaint
and
in
answers
to
interrogatories.
the
united
fruit
line
said,
“you
will
not
be
permitted
to
hire
your
own
doctor
or
we
will
stop
your
maintenance.
you
go
to
the
marine
hospital.”
obviously,
the
point
was
that
if
he
went
to
his
private
doctor,
his
maintenance
would
continue
because
he
does
not
get
maintenance
while
in
the
marine
hospital.
he
wanted
his
maintenance.
he
had
no
means.
he
had
no
choice
of
freedom
of
bargaining.
so
he
discharged
his
own
doctor
and
went
to
the
marine
hospital.
he
says
that
but
for
a
promise
by
the
united
fruit
line
to
indemnify
him
for
any
damages,
they
had
a
lot
of
conversations,
many
and
the
substance
of
it
was
if
there
is
anything
that
befalls
you
by
reason
of
faulty
treatment
or
lack
of
treatment,
we
will
compensate
you
for
all
your
damage
or
loss.
that
was
not
in
writing.
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
was
a
district
judge,
judge
bicks,
held
that
the
statute
of
frauds
barred
the
action
on
the
contract
made
by
the
united
fruit
line
with
the
chief
steward
to
the
effect
that
the
united
fruit
line
would
indemnify
him
for
damages.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes
and
we
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
contract.
call
it
by
whatever
terms,
whatever
material
may
be
spoken
of,
it
is
still
a
contract,
it
is
still
a
seaman's
contract
and
it
is
still
subject
to
the
scrutiny
given
to
a
seaman's
release.
now
that
the
same
scales
of
justice
should
be
employed
in
measuring
the
circumstances
under
which
that
contract
was
entered
into.
but
for
the
statute
of
frauds
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
decision,
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
asserts
in
substance
that
the
petitioner
will
have
a
malt
--
a
valid
cause
of
action
for
the
maltreatment
at
the
marine
hospital.
mr.
jacob
rassner
no,
justice
stewart,
there
is
not.
mr.
jacob
rassner
that
is
true.
and
our
amended
complaint
paragraph
19
on
page
5
shows
that
we
did
allege
that
he
was
not
treated
properly
because
his
maintenance
was
just
cut
off
and
he
had
no
freedom
of
action,
no
choice
of
selecting
his
own
doctor
whom
he
had
selected.
now
we
take
the
possession
that
the
new
york
statute
of
frauds
which
curtails
his
rights,
is
no
different
in
the
law
is
applicable
to
relations
generally.
you
do
not
judge
seamen
on
the
basis
of
state
law
when
you
treat
with
a
contract
called
a
release
and
i
do
not
see
why
this
type
of
contract
falls
on
any
different
category.
that's
my
personal
view
on
it.
now,
insofar
as
the
argument
and
i
did
not
ask
for
time
to
rebuttal,
i
know
what
the
arguments
are
by
mr.
eugene
underwood
that
in
so
far
as
other
states,
50
states
have
similar
statutes
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
they
may
have
similar
statute
as
to
seamen's
releases.
we're
dealing
with
a
maritime
tort.
now,
the
--
to
let
the
court
below
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
maritime
tort
which
illegibly
--
which
that
the
tort
is
the
failure
to
given
the
treatment
a
breach
of
contract
is
failing
to
give
in
his
maintenance
and
cure.
so,
whether
we
deal
with
maritime
tort
or
maritime
contract,
we're
dealing
with
maritime
law
and
state
law
should
not
be
permitted,
to
court
--
curtails.
mr.
jacob
rassner
the
choice
of
expression
was
ill
advised.
i
should
have
--
i
should
have
read
--
just
refer
to
the
breach
of
contract.
there
was
a
tort
involved
in
the
way
the
complaint
is
drawn,
failure
to
give
him
cure
and
treatment,
failure
to
give
him
his
maintenance
was
at
tort.
but
we
are
primarily
consigned
with
the
contract
at
this
particular
discussion
of
his
rights.
we
take
the
position
that
the
contract
for
maintenance
and
cure
and
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
room
for
rebuttal
or
refuting
that
contention,
it
is
maritime.
it's
part
of
the
wages
of
the
seamen
and
i
think
this
court
has
expressed
it
any
number
of
cases
including
the
last
six
or
seven
that
came
down
dealing
with
seamen.
i
have
reference
to
the
mitchell
case,
(inaudible),
i
have
reference
to
the
romero
case
and
several
of
the
others
treating
with
and
(inaudible)
all
treat
with
the
fact
that
a
seaman's
right
to
maintenance
and
cure
is
part
and
parcel
of
his
contract
of
employment.
now,
if
we
make
a
distinction
between
the
responsibility
and
the
end
result,
we
are
taking
a
maritime
contract
and
chopping
it
into
pieces.
if
he
is
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure,
he
is
entitled
to
it
by
reason
of
his
employment,
his
contractual
relationship
to
the
ship.
if
something
is
substituted
for
it,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
creates
a
cleavage.
if
they
substitute
a
promise
to
give
him
money
on
shore
for
the
obligation
of
maintenance
and
cure,
which
is
certainly
ashore
most
of
the
time,
if
not
always,
i
do
not
see
where
the
learned
court
below
was
justified
into
the
conclusion.
this
was
a
contract
to
be
performed
ashore.
it
doesn't
make
the
slightest
bit
of
difference
in
my
humble
opinion
where
it
was
to
be
performed.
mr.
jacob
rassner
it
is
most
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
read
the
part
of
the
lower
court's
decision
of
page
22
of
the
transcript
the
above
four
or
five
lines
down.
nevertheless,
it
is
obvious
that
it
applies
only
to
maritime
contracts.
the
contract
sued
on
is
not
maritime
contract
since
it
was
merely
a
promise
to
pay
money
on
land
if
the
former
seems
to
be
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
oh,
that
is
another
point
of
error
which
we
urge
that
the
mere
giving
of
piece
of
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
it
is
most
difficult
to
counsel
to
differ
with
the
justice
of
the
supreme
court
but
i
respectfully
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
but
i
do
have
the
difficulty
now.
i
don't
see
if
that's
void
at
all.
i
see
it
as
a
maritime
contract.
no
matter
what
language
is
used,
no
matter
what
substitution
was
made.
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
it's
--
if
we
take
that
as
an
assumption,
then
the
answer
is
right.
i
don't
think
that
assumption
at
all.
i
say
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
if
--
yes,
of
course.
mr.
jacob
rassner
then
the
answer
is
yes,
it's
satisfied.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes,
sir.
i
-
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
i
--
i
take
a
great
deal
of
relief
from
reading
the
opinion
in
the
erickson
case
insofar
as
eliminating
the
distinction
between
whether
it's
in
writing
or
whether
it's
forum.
and,
insofar
as
(inaudible)
the
statute
of
fraud
deals
only
with
the
distinction.
is
it
in
writing,
is
it
oral?
i
take
the
--
the
satisfaction
to
that
extent
from
the
erickson
case,
but,
my
point
is
--
is
that
being
maritime
at
its
very
nature.
it
can't
change
as
substituting,
a
promise
to
pay
on
land
doesn't
change
it.
the
second
point
is,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
bargaining
parties.
it
is
utterly
ridiculous
to
assume
that
a
seaman
is
going
to
ask
ship
owner
or
for
that
matter
get
from
him
or
a
claim
agent,
a
written
agreement
when
they
substitute
something
for
the
right
to
maintenance.
that's
just
is
unrealistic.
and
when
we're
dealing
with
seamen,
we
have
to
be
realistic,
this
court
has
so
stated.
then
the
next
question
comes
like
your
honor,
i
think
wrote
in
pisel
case.
you
have
to
consider
the
bargaining
positions
of
both
parties.
here
is
a
man
who
has
actually
made
an
agreement
with
his
doctor
to
be
treated.
the
united
fruit
line
comes
in
and
says
"don't
do
that.
why
go
to
that
expense.
why
put
us
to
that
expense
in
substance.
we
think
the
us
marine
hospital
is
good
enough
anything
happens,
we'll
make
it
up
to
you."
now,
if
that
had
been
in
writing,
it
have
a
cause
of
action
but
who
would
ever
think
of
getting
that
writing
so
in
--
so
my
position
is
this
that
we
have
to
take
a
realistic
approach.
unfortunately,
i
didn't
get
this
case
until
several
years
after
the
statute
against
the
government
had
run.
mr.
jacob
rassner
well,
that's
the
--
we
--
i
would
have
--
i
wouldn't
have
been
here
otherwise,
but
we
certainly
would
not
have
a
complaint
dismissed.
the
point
i
make
is
that
it's
still
maritime.
it
just
that
it
isn't
writing.
mr.
jacob
rassner
no.
no,
i
think
that
the
question
of
the
statute
of
fraud
is
only
incidental.
i
think
that
here
is
a
seaman's
action
where
the
more
important
question
is
the
obligation
and
i
think
that
that
is
primarily
why
we're
here.
to
get
instruction,
how
far
is
the
duty
of
--
of
a
ship
owner,
how
far
does
it
extend?
does
it
extend
only
to
the
time
they
give
a
master
certificate
or
a
hospital
certificate
or
does
it
go
beyond
that?
does
maximum
benefit
of
pure
mean
maximum
benefit
until
the
seaman
is
out
of
their
hands
and
the
hands
of
marine
hospital
or
does
it
mean
what
it
literally
says,
maximum
cure
that
the
obligation
does
not
die?
it
is
not
sent
into
limbo
when
the
certificate
is
given.
the
obligation
is,
if
i
read
it
literally
is
the
big
maximum
cure
is
the
terminating
point.
and
until
then,
it
is
still
the
ship
owner's
obligation
regardless
of
who
the
individual
is
that
gives
the
treatment.
there
is
nobody
can
argue
that
the
government
hospital
was
grossly
neglectible
here.
they
gave
a
man
a
--
i
think
it
was
a
male
nurse,
gave
this
man
an
anesthetic
full
strength
and
burned
the
anus
completely
out
that
he
have
to
have
a
colostomy
done
at
one
side
and
then
neglect
him
further,
that
became
effected,
he
have
to
do
a
second
colostomy
on
for
a
simple
goiter
operation
and
turned
out
that
the
man
is
ruined
for
life
as
chief
steward.
now,
the
question
is
one
that
presents
a
legal
question.
where
does
--
that
is
the
main
point,
where
does
the
obligation
stop?
at
the
issuing
of
the
certificate,
can
the
ship
owner
say
now
i
wash
my
hands
of
it,
of
every
responsibility
i
have
given
you
a
certificate
or
does
it
continue
until
that
particular
seaman
has
gotten
the
maximum
benefit
of
medical
and
surgical
aid
in
attendance
irrespective
of
who
--
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
rassner
yes,
sir.
now,
discontinued
a
cause
of
action
for
maintenance
because
his
maintenance
was
paid
and
we
did
not
want
a
few
dollars
that
was
left
over
standing
away
of
having
the
question
fully
presented
and
we
have
to
take
to
the
other
and
i
voluntarily
discontinue
the
second
cause
of
action
so
we
can
have
a
main
issue
taken
upon
appeal.
otherwise,
it
would
have
been
premature.
mr.
jacob
rassner
it
is
not
here
in
that
sense.
it
is
here
in
the
sense
that
under
the
contract
that
the
petitioner
entered
into
with
the
united
states
lines.
the
question
is
one,
even
to
come
within
the
very
provisions
of
the
new
york
statute
of
frauds,
because
of
the
obligation
was
the
united
states
--
united
fruit
lines
obligation
to
place
distance,
then
it
did
not
have
to
be
in
writing.
then
their
promise
orally
made
would
be
sufficient.
in
other
words,
if
the
obligation
or
death
is
the
primsor's,
it
does
not
have
to
be
in
writing
under
the
new
york
statute.
i've
quoted
it
in
that
brief.
mr.
jacob
rassner
i
wonder
if
might
my
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
questions?
mr.
jacob
rassner
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
asked
us
to
the
union
fish
company
case
erickson,
judge
ryebell
referred
to
that
case.
i
have
that
on
page
7
of
my
brief
and
i
would
like
to
ask
one
more
point
of
mr.
underwood
raised
which
was
not
taken
up
in
the
statute
of
limitations
as
to
the
united
food
two
or
three
years.
there
was
nothing
to
stop
them
for
impleding
u.s.
government
after
the
two-year
statute
had
run.
so
that
the
fault
could've
actually
be
determined
at
one
trial
so
that
a
real
tort
we
sought
could
have
been
held
to
account.
