mr.
eugene
underwood
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
to
say
a
few
words
at
the
outset
as
to
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
rassner
has
said
and
i
say
this
somewhat
in
passing
but
this
man
has
been
ruined
for
life.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
this.
this
case
came
up
from
a
decision
on
a
motion
but
the
fact
is
that
he
has
been
employed
quite
frequently
in
recent
times
on
board
united
states
lines
vessel
as
a
chief
steward.
as
to
what
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
about
the
duty
of
maintenance
and
cure
being
delegable
or
not
delegable.
this
was
not
held
below.
neither
court
below
discussed
or
decided
such
a
question.
the
suggestion
seems
to
be
that
it's
the
duty
as
part
of
cure
for
the
ship
owner
to
the
stand
over
the
medical
man
and
supervise
the
medical
man's
attentions
to
the
patient.
this
has
never
been
held
by
any
court
anywhere.
there
is
no
question
upon
seaworthiness
or
negligence
in
this
case.
there
is
no
question
as
to
liability
or
any
breach
of
duty
on
the
part
of
this
defendant.
the
only
question
is
one
of
contract.
indeed,
there
is
no
question
of
maintenance
and
cure
as
such.
that
cause
of
action
has
been
discontinued.
to
correct
a
statement,
mr.
rassner
made,
no
maintenance
was
ever
withheld
in
this
case.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
that
in
the
record
and
i
have
brought
here
for
display
as
may
be
needed
this
man's
original
receipts
for
a
maintenance
that
was
paid
to
him
over
the
months
that
follow.
there
is
not
therefore
any
question
in
this
case
of
maintenance
and
cure
at
all.
the
only
question
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir.
because
cure
was
supplied
by
giving
the
master's
certificate
to
a
public
health
service
hospital
which
this
defendant
had
reason
to
believe
was
a
competent
public
institution.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
can't
quite
tell.
i
would
much
rather
have
mr.
rassner
speak
for
himself
if
your
honor
please.
he
challenges
great
many
things,
sometimes
more
and
sometimes
less
one
time
or
another.
however,
if
that
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
--
i
say
that
it
does.
in
calmar
against
taylor
in
303
us,
this
court
so
held,
and
i
have
a
brief
quotation
of
it
on
page
22
of
the
respondent's
brief.
mr.
eugene
underwood
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
sir.
in
my
judgment,
in
my
opinion,
it
is
sir.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
â€“
or
not
this
alleged
oral
contract
by
this
defendant
which
it
denies
to
answer
for
the
debt
or
default,
the
possible
debt
or
default
of
the
public
health
service
people
if
they
should
per
chance,
injure
this
man
in
the
course
of
administering
cure
is
a
valid
contract
and
enforceable
and
the
defense
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
possibly
so,
that's
one
view.
our
view
was
that
the
statute
of
frauds
controls
it
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
maritime
or
not
because
to
apply
the
statute
of
frauds
to
this
contract,
if
it
be
maritime
would
not
distort
or
disarrange
the
so
called
uniform
admiralty
rule.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
sir.
i
so
understand
it.
mr.
eugene
underwood
that
is
--
that
is
the
cure
point,
judge
hawkes'
opinion
in
barker
said
that
that
complies
with
the
shipowner's
duty--
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
it
was
sir.
mr.
eugene
underwood
my
recollection
is
sir
that
the
second
cause
of
action
included
maintenance
and
cure
and
that
that
has
been
discontinued.
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
it
on
the
record.
mr.
eugene
underwood
but
it
all
--
yes
sir.
mr.
eugene
underwood
if
the
court
please,
on
page
six
of
the
record,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
where
the
second
cause
of
action
paragraph
22nd,
alleges
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
defendant
to
provide
the
plaintiff
for
the
expenses
in
his
maintenance
and
cure.
now
that
cause
of
action
was
discontinued.
if
you'll
refer
to
page
14
of
the
record
ordered
that
the
second
cause
of
action
in
the
within
cause
be
and
herby
is
discontinued
without
prejudice
and
without
cause.
mr.
eugene
underwood
well,
that
--
that
just
may
be
sir.
but
our
--
our
point
is
that
the
owner,
the
ship
owner
in
defending
itself
against
seaman's
claims
needs
the
protection
of
the
statue
of
frauds
as
much
as
any
class
of
defendants
in
the
community.
mr.
eugene
underwood
it's
very
rarely
been
cited
if
the
court
please
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
erickson.
that
was
a
contract
between
a
ship
master
and
a
ship
owner
to
serve
as
master
for
an
indefinite
time,
more
than
a
year.
before
the
lapse
of
the
year
had
passed,
he
was
fired
for
failure
to
perform
his
duties
properly
and
he
sued
on
the
contract.
that's
all.
that
was
obviously
a
maritime
contract,
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
eugene
underwood
--
as
the
master
of
a
ship
and
you
could
hardly
get
anything
more
maritime
than
that.
mr.
eugene
underwood
i
should
think
that
would
be
true
although
the
application
--
the
--
this
court's
refusal
to
apply
the
statute
to
that
case
has
been
criticized
by
some
of
the
text
writers.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
sir,
no
sir.
now,
of
course
to
apply
the
statue
of
frauds
to
a
case
of
this
court
works
no
prejudice
to
the
uniform
maritime
rule
because
there
isn't
any
uniform
maritime
rule
about
what
must
be
and
may
not
or
need
not
be
in
writing.
and
furthermore,
all
50
states
do
have
a
statute
of
frauds
or
its
very
substantial
equivalent
so
that
if
you
do
apply
each
state's
statute,
you
will
get
the
same
result
anyway.
mr.
eugene
underwood
no,
sir
except
--
none
that
i'm
aware
of
except
the
statutes
that
required
that
seaman's
articles
being
writing,
i
know
of
no
other.
now,
this
court
has
been
getting
further
and
further
away
from
the
uniformity
of
doctrine
anyway
in
recent
times.
in
standard
dredging
company
against
murphy
where
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
opinion,
you
held
at
new
york
unemployment
insurance
tax
must
be
paid
by
the
employers
of
maritime
workers
and
the
payment
of
such
a
tax
to
new
york
would
not
destroy
a
maritime
uniformity.
in
a
recent
case,
huron
portland
cement
against
detroit
you
held
at
a
municipal
ordinance
requiring
certain
smoke
retarders
in
tug
boats
which
all
already
been
passed
by
the
inspectors
of
the
coast
guard
was
not
violative
of
the
uniformity
concept.
in
kelly
against
washington
several
years
ago,
you
held
the
same
way
with
regard
to
state
inspection
of
diesel
tugs
although
the
federal
government
did
not
require
diesel
tugs
to
be
inspected
and
although
the
federal
government
had
established
their
(inaudible)
for
a
system
of
inspections
and
exempted
them
and
so
on.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
basic,
the
underlying
question
in
this
case
and
the
decision
that
the
petitioner
would
like
to
get
from
this
court
is
one
to
the
effect
that
the
ship
owner
is
bound
to
pay
for
the
damages
resulting
for
malpractice
even
in
the
case
such
as
this
where
there
is
no
liability
for
the
original
ailment
that
makes
it
necessary
for
the
man
to
seek
medical
attention.
now,
there
is
no
precedent
for
such
a
ruling
anywhere,
and
there
are
several
contrary
to
it
which
i
referred
to
in
my
brief.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
questions
i've
already
indicated
to
you
that
in
calmar,
this
court
indicated
that
a
limit
of
the
ship
owner's
obligation
where
the
man
does
go
to
the
public
health
service
hospital
is
to
make
that
available
to
him
by
master
certificate.
the
books
are
full
of
cases
where
the
ship
owner
has
been
held
to
have
complied
with
his
requirements,
fulfilled
his
duty
by
providing
competent
medical
attention.
there
are
i
think
four
cases
in
the
books
where
the
ship
owner
has
provided
medical
attention
by
some
person
or
institution
which
has
proved
not
to
be
infallible
namely
where
the
man
has
been
injured
as
a
result
of
some
malpractice
or
mistake
in
the
medical
institution
or
at
a
doctor's
hands.
and
uniformly
in
those
cases,
the
ship
owner
has
been
exonerated
has
not
been
held
liable
for
that
kind
of
injury
or
that
negligence
because
it
needs
one
of
those
cases
as
here,
the
ship
owner
was
justified
in
believing
that
the
medical
institution
or
the
medical
doctor
was
licensed
and
competent.
that's
his
full
duty.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes,
sir.
and
that
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes
and
there
would
be
no
consequences.
mr.
eugene
underwood
this
man
had
a
perfectly
complete
and
adequate
remedy.
he
could
have
sued
the
united
states
for
this
injury
that
befell
him
and
he
had
a
complete
remedy.
unfortunately
for
him
and
it's
very
regrettable,
he
left
the
time
go
by
but
that
of
course
is
no
reason
why
the
law
of
maintenance
and
cure
should
suddenly
and
without
allowing
the
industry
to
be
heard
on
the
question
would
be
greatly
enlarged
to
require
ship
owners
to
be
responsible
for
the
malpractice
of
any
perfectly
well-qualified
physician
or
a
surgeon
to
whom
it
might
send
a
man
for
treatment.
a
ship
owner
can't
possibly
be
expected
to
stand
over
the
doctor
or
the
surgeon
and
supervise
his
treatment
and
that's
what
a
decision
in
favor
of
this
petitioner
would
require.
mr.
eugene
underwood
oh
yes.
i've
gone
one
step
behind
that.
i
say
that
the
opposition
in
that
believe
to
be
perfectly
sound
as
the
court
of
appeals
thought
and
i
have
said
that
i
think
what
really
the
petitioner
really
wants
this
court
to
decide
regardless
of
the
promise
or
the
statue
of
fraud
or
the
maritime
nature
of
the
contract,
i
think
what
the
petitioner
really
wants
for
this
court
to
decide
is
that
maintenance
and
cure
is
such
a
broad
thing
that
it
includes
not
only
providing
or
making
you
available
to
competent
medical
attention,
but
would
also
includes
actual
affecting
of
a
cure.
that
is
what
i
say
has
never,
never
been
held.
and
if
that's
to
be
the
law
then
i
respectfully
submit
the
congress
should
be
permitted
to
make
it
so.
mr.
eugene
underwood
oh
no
sir,
no,
sir.
this
has
a
--
mr.
eugene
underwood
oh,
by
virtue
of
the
pleadings
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
yes.
mr.
eugene
underwood
yes
the
purposes
of
this
argument,
it
is
admitted
but
as
judge
bick
said
in
his
opinion,
we
all
think
there
is
a
strategem
to
get
around
the
tort
three-year
statute.
thank
you.
