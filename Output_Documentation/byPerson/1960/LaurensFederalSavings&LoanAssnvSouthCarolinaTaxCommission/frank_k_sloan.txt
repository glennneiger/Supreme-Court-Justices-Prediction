mr.
frank
k.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
your
petitioner,
the
laurens
federal
savings
and
loan
association,
respectfully
submits
that
the
issue
for
the
court's
consideration
here
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
briefly
stated
whether
section
1433
of
title
12
of
the
united
states
code,
which
was
section
13
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
act
of
1932,
prohibits
taxation
by
the
state
of
south
carolina
in
the
form
of
--
of
a
documentary
stamp
tax,
notes
given
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank
to
--
or
to
the
federal
home
loan
banks
by
their
member,
savings
and
loan
associations
over
the
nation,
two
other
states,
florida
and
pennsylvania,
have
similar
documentary
stamp
tax
statutes
which
are
referred
to
in
the
brief.
the
precise
question
before
this
honorable
court
is
the
correctness
of
the
construction
of
two
federal
statutes
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
that
is,
the
section
1433
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
act
of
1932
and
section
1464
(h)
of
the
same
title
which
was
section
5
(h)
of
the
home
owners'
loan
act
of
1933.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
has
ruled,
in
effect,
that
the
second
section,
1464
(h),
narrowed
the
exemption
from
taxation
provided
by
the
main
section,
1433,
and
that
this
reduction
or
narrowing
process
enables
the
states
to
tax
this
particular
transaction.
now,
the
factual
situation,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
relatively
simple.
the
petitioner,
sa
--
the
federal
savings
and
loan
association
here,
as
do
other
savings
and
loan
associations,
paid
under
protest
and
then
brought
suit
to
recover
in
the
state
court
documentary
stamp
taxes
of
$2200
some
which
were
levied
under
section
688
of
title
65
of
the
south
carolina
code
which
is
a
general
statute
exacting
a
4
cents
per
$100
documentary
stamp
tax
on
promissory
notes
executed
in
the
state.
now,
these
taxes
of
$2200
some
represented
the
documentary
stamp
tax
on
some
$5,675,000
worth
of
notes
given
by
this
petitioner,
savings
and
loan
association,
to
the
federal
home
loan
bank
at
greensborough,
north
carolina,
the
bank
that
it
is
a
member
of.
as
the
court
is
aware,
of
course,
these
home
loan
banks
are
set
up
in
each
of
the
districts.
the
volume
of
loans
which
they
make
to
their
members
and,
therefore,
the
amount
of
tax
incidence
that
might
arise
from
this
sort
of
taxing
statute
could
be
substantial
indeed.
for
example,
at
--
december
31,
1959,
this
federal
home
loan
bank
at
greensborough,
alone,
had
some
$51
million
of
outstanding
loans.
now,
then,
the
trial
court
and
the
--
on
appeal,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
ruled
that
the
general
exemption
from
state
taxation
which
is
provided
to
the
federal
home
loan
banks
and
their
transactions
by
section
1433
of
the
act
of
1932
had
been
so
narrowed
by
section
1464
(h),
which
was
the
act
of
1933,
as
to
permit
a
taxation
of
this
character.
briefly
stated,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
two
sections
concerned
provide
in
the
pertinent
part
as
follows.
section
1433
grants
to
the
federal
home
loan
bank
the
following.
the
bank,
including
its
franchise,
its
capital,
reserves,
surpluses,
its
advances
or
loans,
and
its
income
shall
be
exempt
from
all
taxation
now
or
hereafter
imposed
by
the
united
states
or
by
any
territory,
dependency,
possession,
or
by
any
state,
county,
municipality,
or
local
taxing
authority.
this,
may
it
please
the
court,
gave
to
the
federal
home
loan
banks
a
general
exemption
from
taxation
with
the
exception
of
real
property
taxes
mentioned
in
the
same
section,
not
here
pertinent.
now,
then,
in
1933,
in
enacting
the
home
loan
--
the
home
owners'
loan
act
of
1933,
in
section
1464
(h),
which
is
the
section
relied
upon
by
the
state
court
in
south
carolina,
there
was
a
provision
that
states
might
tax
the
associations
which
are
members
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank.
and,
its
language
was
no
state
territory,
county,
municipal
or
local
taxing
authority
shall
impose
any
tax
on
such
associations
or
their
franchise,
capital,
surplus,
and
so
forth
greater
than
that
imposed
on
other
similar
local,
mutual
or
cooperative,
home
financing
institutions.
now,
then,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
grasping
this
section
of
the
home
owners'
loan
act
of
1933,
said
that,
since
this
documentary
stamp
tax
is
applied
with
an
even
hand,
that
they
interpret
the
section
1464
(h)
to
permit
the
taxation
of
this
transaction
with
the
home
loan
bank
itself.
they
consider
it
to
be
a
narrowing
by
implication,
at
least,
of
the
49
--
section
1433
exemption.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
yes,
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
then,
the
state
court,
in
relying
here,
of
course,
was
then
brought
to
and
it
attempted,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
deal
with
some
very
troublesome
problems
there
because
it
had
to
consider
then
whether
or
not
these
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
are
federal
instrumentalities
and
whether
or
not
the
tax,
as
levied,
was
nondiscriminatory
and,
of
course,
this
would
also
bring
the
problem
to
bear
of
whether
the
tax
of
this
sort
would
interfere
with
the
transactions
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
itself
which
are
plainly
exempt
under
1433.
these
problems
your
petitioner
has
firmly
astute,
we
say
that
they
are
not
necessary.
they
should
not
be
reached
and
the
construction
of
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
in
the
area
is
not
correct.
there,
the
court
said
there
â€“
there
rather,
we
state
--
addressed
our
--
that
problem
this
answer.
the
court's
reading
of
this
federal
statute
raises
a
difficult
and
substantial
problem
which
should
be
avoided
unless
the
language
of
1464
(h)
makes
it
inescapable.
for
example,
there
arises
the
question
of
whether
the
state
tax
is
discriminatory,
whether
it's
burdensome
upon
the
activities
of
the
bank.
we
--
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
the
question
raised
by
the
state,
in
its
brief,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
that
the
--
that
it
is
not
discriminar
--
discriminatory
because
the
state
savings
and
loan
association
would
have
to
pay
it
and
this
relieves
only
the
federal
savings
and
loan
association.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
that
--
we
do
not
agree
that
they
do,
sir.
we
think
it's
nondiscriminatory.
now,
may
we
say
here
that
the
short
answer
to
the
state
court's
statement
that
the
documentary
state
tax
here
imposed
is
nondiscriminatory
and
within
the
scope
of
section
1464
(h)
is
that
this
section
gives
the
states
power
only
to
tax
these
associations
on
their
activities
and
transactions
in
the
specified
areas
but,
in
no
way,
gives
the
states
the
right
to
tax
the
transactions
between
the
federal
home
loan
banks
and
their
members
which
are
specifically
exempted
by
section
1433.
in
other
words,
section
1433,
if
the
state
court's
construction
is
to
be
adopted,
would
have
to
be,
by
implication,
affected,
narrowed,
partly
paired
away
by
section
1464
(h)
and
a
following
act
in
the
next
year
in
an
area
not
directly
discussed.
now,
this
state
--
we
submit,
this
tax
is
an
indirect
and
forbidden
tax
upon
the
advances,
that's
the
precise
word
in
section
1433
itself,
since
the
note
or
obligation
necessary
to
obtain
these
advances
from
the
federal
home
loan
banks
are
the
--
of
course,
an
integral
part
of
the
entire
loans
transaction.
now,
the
state
court
has
actually
conceded
that
1433
really
does
control
these
transactions
but
seeks
to
answer
our
argument
in
this
manner.
from
page
18
of
the
transcript,
"it
is
clear
from
the
foregoing
statute,"
that's
section
1433,
"that
the
immunity
provided
therein
from
taxation
applies
only
to
federal
home
loan
banks."
the
respondent
here,
the
state
taxing
authority,
has
not
sought
to
place
any
documentary
tax
upon
the
federal
home
loan
bank
but,
as
such,
has
been
assessed
only
against
the
appellant,
which
is
the
savings
and
loan
association.
if
the
respondent
had
attempted
to
place
a
documentary
stamp
tax
upon
some
obligation
issued
by
the
federal
home
loan
bank,
the
above
quoted
statute
would
be
applicable
and
such
bank
would
be
entitled
to
the
immunity
therein
provided.
now,
we
respectfully
submit,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
this
court
has
conclusively
answered
that
very
argument
and,
in
truth,
decided
the
issue,
we
think
in
this
case,
in
the
case
of
pittman
versus
home
owners'
loan
corporation,
opinion
by
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
in
1939,
308
u.s.
21
which
is
cited,
of
course,
discussed
in
the
briefs.
now,
in
the
pittman
case,
the
state
of
maryland
required
the
payment
or
attempted
to
require
the
payment
of
a
state
recording
tax
evidenced
by
stamps
and,
again,
measured
and
graded
by
the
amount
of
the
loans
just
as
these
are,
before
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
which,
of
course,
was
a
subsidiary
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank
to
record
his
mortgages.
and,
this
court,
in
the
pittman
case,
said,
in
quoting
the
section
4
(c)
of
the
home
owners'
loan
act
of
1933
which
had
practically
identical
language,
the
corporation,
including
its
loan,
shall
likewise
be
exempt
from
such
taxation,
all
taxation
now
are
here
after
imposed
by
any
state
or
county.
now,
in
striking
down
that
maryland
state
tax
on
these
home
owners'
loan
mortgages,
this
court
said
that
it
was
immaterial
who
was
actually
required
to
pay
the
tax.
"whoever
pays
it,
said
mr.
chief
justice
hughes,
"it's
a
tax
upon
the
mortgage
and
that
is
what
is
forbidden
by
the
law
of
the
united
states."
and,
he
quotes
there
justice
holmes'
language
from
the
case
of
the
federal
land
bank
versus
crosland,
also
cited
in
the
brief,
in
which
there
was
an
attempt
to
require
recording
tax
to
be
placed
on
a
federal
home
loans
bank
--
or
federal
land
bank
mortgage.
we
submit,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
that
precise
argument
answers
what
is
said
by
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
in
its
decision.
it
doesn't
matter
here
who
pays
the
tax.
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
said,
"we're
not
assessing
a
tax
on
the
federal
home
loan
bank.
we're
assessing
it
on
this
association."
the
fact
is
that
it
does
not
matter
because
the
tax
itself
on
the
transaction
is
what
is
forbidden.
the
federal
home
loan
bank
advances
$5
million.
the
state
of
south
carolina
exacts
$2270
in
taxes
from
that
transaction.
it
begs
the
question
to
say,
"we're
not
taxing
the
home
loan
bank
transaction.
we're
taxing
this
local
association."
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
this
particular
section,
1433,
and
the
word
"advances"
in
it
plainly
shows
exactly
what
is
meant
by
this
term
"advances"
and
the
fact
that
the
congress,
in
considering
this
section,
1433,
and
in
drafting
it,
meant
plainly
that
the
word
"advances"
in
section
1433
would
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
word
"loans"
in
the
home
owners'
loan
act
section
which
had
been
construed
in
the
pittman
case
by
this
court.
that
is
the
precise
distinction.
in
section
1433,
before
the
court
today,
the
word
"advances,"
as
inserted
in
the
exemption
statute,
for
the
word
"loans"
in
the
statute
before
the
court
in
the
pittman
case.
now,
this
--
the
bill
originally
did
not
have
the
word
"advances"
in
there.
the
loans
or
advances
to
be
made
by
the
home
loan
bank,
as
the
bill
was
originally
drafted,
were
not
to
be
tax-exempt,
may
it
please
the
court.
but,
when
it
passed
the
house
in
that
form,
the
senate
propo
--
an
amendment
was
proposed
in
the
senate,
this
--
this
information
is
cited
on
--
in
our
brief
on
page
16,
and
was
promptly
accepted
to
make
specific
a
tax
exemption
for
its
advances
to
the
members.
and,
senator
reed
who
offered
the
amendment
had
this
explanation.
he
said,
"we
should
not,
of
course,
put
the
loans
of
this
bank
in
the
position
of
being
taxable
in
the
several
states."
i
do
not
believe
they
were
to
be
anyway
as
they
are
part
of
its
capital
and
reserves,
but
this
would
make
it
clear
that
the
bank's
assets
are
not,
in
fact,
taxable
by
the
state
or
municipalities.
it
--
it
went
back
to
conference
which
conferred
in
this
amendment
and
it
went
to
the
house
which
receded
and
the
house
managers,
as
they
explained
this
amendment
in
the
congressional
record,
stated
this
is
a
clarifying
amendment
to
make
certain
that
advances
by
home
loan
banks
to
members
are
tax-exempt.
the
house
recedes
with
an
amendment
applying
the
provision
to
all
advances.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
feel
that
the
state
court's
attempt
to
answer
the
pittman
case
in
this
language
is
not
adequate.
they
state,
the
transcript
on
page
19,
"we
should
emphasize,"
this
is
the
language
of
the
state
court
decision,
"that
the
mortgage
sought
to
be
taxed
in
the
pittman
case
was
offered
for
record
by
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation."
it
is
readily
apparent
that
the
rule
there
announced
is
not
applicable
under
the
factual
situation
here.
we
should
also
point
out
that,
in
the
pittman
case,
the
tax
was
sought
to
be
imposed
against
the
corporation
which
was
immune
from
such
tax
by
reason
of
the
federal
statute.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
submit
that
that
was
the
plain
language
of
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
crosland-federal
land
bank
case
quoted
and,
again,
reinforced
in
the
pittman
case
that
it
matters
not
against
whom
the
tax
is
levied.
it's
a
tax
upon
the
transaction
which
is
exempted
by,
in
this
case,
section
1433
and
that
is
what
the
law
forbids.
we
think
that
the
united
states,
which
has
filed
a
brief
as
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
today,
has
got
a
very
apt
statement
of
the
matter
in
supporting
our
petition
and
supporting
our
request
that
you
reversed
the
decision
of
the
state
court.
they
say,
on
page
10,
"while
it
is
true
that
by
prohibiting
discriminatory
taxation
of
federal
savings
and
loan
associations,
that
statute,
section
1464
(h),
impliedly
allows
nondiscriminatory
levies
upon
them.
it
does
not
follow
that
the
congress
took
this
circuitous
way
of
permitting
taxation
of
the
very
advances
by
home
loan
banks
which
it
had
specifically
exempted
in
1433."
may
it
please
the
court,
we
are
firmly
of
the
opinion
that
this
court
has
spoken
in
the
pittman
case
that
the
language
of
the
two
statutory
sections
concerned
are
precise
and
identical,
for
all
practical
and
legal
purposes,
that
this
is
an
attempt
to
tax
the
loan
transactions
of
the
federal
home
loan
bank.
it's
a
tax
on
that
transaction
no
matter
which
pocket
it
may
appear
to
come
from.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
a
word
in
response
to
attorney
general
windham's
argument,
we
would
like
to
comment
principally
that
the
two
decisions
which
he
cites,
the
minnesota
decision
which
had
dealt
with
the
income
tax
which
is
specifically
permitted
by
section
1464
(h)
and
the
california
case
which
had
to
do
with
the
farm
credit
act
in
which
section
1138
(c)
of
the
farm
credit
act
providing
exemptions
specifically
excludes
loans
and
advances
by
the
farm
credit
administration.
so
that,
we
have
in
section
1433
a
specific
inclusion
of
an
exemption
for
these
particular
loans
and
transactions.
we
do
not
have
that
in
the
california
case.
in
the
minnesota
case,
the
income
tax
levied
on
the
association
is
specifically
permitted
by
section
1464
(h).
so,
we
respectfully
take
the
position
that
neither
case
can
be
of
used
to
the
court
in
considering
this
question.
the
precise
matter
is
that
section
1464
(h),
if
it's
to
be
interpreted
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
has
interpreted,
would
require
this
court
to
say
that
the
congress
by
implication,
in
an
indirect
way
stating
that
states
might
tax
associations,
live
to
and
did,
in
fact,
amend
or
repeal
this
provision
that
says
that
the
advances
and
the
loan
transactions
of
the
home
loan
banks
cannot
be
taxed.
this
requires
or
would
require,
may
it
please
the
court,
a
finding
that
this
was
done
by
implication
in
the
teeth
of
the
strong
legislative
history
of
the
fact
that
it
was
purposely
determined,
plainly
argued
in
both
houses
that
these
advances
and
loan
were
supposedly
tax-exempt.
we
believe,
again,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
language
of
this
court
in
the
pittman
case
is
controlling.
it
says,
may
i
quote,
"the
critical
term
in
the
present
relation
is
"loans,"
in
this
case,
"advances."
we
think
that
this
term,
in
order
to
carry
up
the
manifest
purpose
of
the
broad
exception,
should
be
construed
as
covering
the
entire
process
of
lending,
the
debts
which
result
there
from,
and
the
mortgages
given
to
the
corporation
as
security.
may
it
please
the
court,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
pittman
case
is
controlling.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
no,
because
the
question
of
the
exemption
of
1464
(h)
did
not
apply
to
this
precise
loan
transaction,
you
see.
it
was
a
direct
mortgage
loan.
we
think
that
the
burden
of
the
state's
argument
here
is
that,
since
the
state
can
tax
income
and
loans
made
by
the
association,
that
the
congress
intended
by
implication
to
go
back
and
cut
down
the
precise
exemption
it
gave
in
1433,
and
we
think
that
that
raises
a
strained
construction
which
is
not
justified
by
the
language
and
immediately
raises
the
question
whether
similar
taxes
by
the
states
or
burdens
among
the
transaction
of
the
banks,
it
brings
us
to
this
troublesome
question
of
whether
or
not
a
federal
savings
and
loan
association
is
an
instrumentality
and,
thereby,
pro
--
protected,
and
so
forth.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
we've
reached
none
of
these.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
the
--
their
position
that
--
that
they
take
is
that
1464
(h),
which
permits
the
state
to
tax
associations,
carries
over
into
the
transaction
exempted
by
1433.
so,
it's
a
quick
matter
of
how
this
court
construes
these
two
sections
together
and
we
believe
their
construction
is
a
strained
one
which
brings
both
an
undesirable
economic
result,
as
far
as
taxing
the
home
loan
bank
operations,
and
the
undesirable
legal
questions
that
would
be
difficult
to
resolve
as
each
tax
statute
of
this
nature
had
to
be
separately
considered.
two
other
states
presently
have
such
statutes,
cal
--
pardon
me,
florida
and
pennsylvania.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice?
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
essentially,
yes,
and
we
say
that,
as
this
court
has
said
in
the
pittman
case,
that
you
can't
split
up
the
loan.
it's
the
entire
loan
transaction
by
the
bank
that's
protected
in
the
exemption
statute
and
we
--
i
concur
that
that
is
the
correct
question,
sir.
mr.
frank
k.
sloan
i
do
not
see
the
distinction
because,
in
the
first
case
which
had
an
identical
exemption
statute,
the
loan
was
made
directly
to
an
individual.
here,
it's
made
to
a
member
of
the
bank
but
the
transactions
are,
in
all
other
respects,
identical.
and,
i
believe
that
the
reading
of
1464
(h)
does
not
justify
the
construction
of
going
beyond
the
state's
power
to
tax
the
association's
income
and
property,
and
things
of
that
sort,
all
the
way
through
to
taxing
the
transaction
with
the
federal
home
loan
bank
itself
which
is
specifically
exempt.
it's
--
it's
a
construction
that
requires
a
strain
to
reach
and
it
upholds
the
tax
which
directly
operates
against
the
loan
and,
thereby,
reduces
the
amount
of
money
available
for
home
loan
transactions
which
was
the
basic
purpose.
we
believe
that
the
insistence
of
the
congress
on
the
including
of
the
word
"advances"
and
their
insistence
upon
its
meaning
in
this
broad
exemption
makes
this
section,
1433,
identical
to
the
section
considered
in
the
pittman
case
and
that,
therefore,
the
logical
result
was
followed.
thank
you.
