mr.
james
m.
windham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
already
been
aptly
demonstrated,
this
is
a
tax
case.
the
situation,
factually,
is
that
the
matter
reaches
this
court
incidentally
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and,
factually,
the
laurens
building
and
loan
association,
a
charted
federal
building
and
loan
association,
operates
at
laurens,
south
carolina
and,
in
the
course
of
time,
it
executed
certain
notes
to
the
federal
home
loan
bank
of
greensborough,
north
carolina.
now,
the
notes
were
issued
for
the
purposes
of
--
purpose
of
obtaining
money
with
which
we
--
which
there
is
no
disagreement
about
this
for
themselves
to
make
loans.
that
is,
for
the
petitioner,
the
building
and
loan,
to
make
loans.
the
notes
were
executed
in
south
carolina
by
the
petitioner.
and,
it
--
the
--
the
south
carolina
code,
section
65
sub
688,
provides
a
documentary
tax
upon
the
creation
of
instruments
within
south
carolina.
included
in
this
category
are
instruments
of
the
nature
such
as
notes
measured
at
the
rate
of
4
cents
per
$100
--
first
$100
and
4
cents
per
each
additional
$100
or
a
fractional
part
thereof.
therefore,
the
amount
of
taxes
involved
here
is
measured
in
that
light.
now,
this
statute
which
--
the
south
carolina
statute
has
been
before
this
court
and
was
passed
upon
as
to
the
nature
of
this
tax
in
the
case
of
graniteville
manufacturing
company
versus
the
south
carolina
tax
commission
or
query,
who
was
then
the
chairman,
and
is
cited
in
our
brief.
this
court
held
that
this
tax
was
an
excise
tax
of
an
ordinary
and
usual
kind
which
had
imposed
a
tax
upon
the
creation
of
an
instrument
within
the
state
of
south
carolina.
so,
this
court
has
acted
to
define
the
area
in
which
this
tax
operates.
now,
this
is
an
--
this
court
stated
that
this
is
an
excise
tax
and,
of
course,
as
--
as
we
understand
it,
there
are
two
broad
areas
of
taxes,
ad
valorem
and
excise.
excise
would
include
a
privilege
or
a
franchise
and,
here,
the
execution
or
the
creation
of
instruments
in
south
carolina
of
a
note
nature
would
be
the
exercise
of
a
privilege
or
in
the
nature
of
an
excise
tax.
now,
those
are
the
facts
involved
in
this
matter.
the
--
the
situation
--
the
question
or
the
issue,
as
we
would
see
it,
is
whether
or
not
the
provisions
of
section
1464
(h)
of
title
12
u.s.c.
would
permit
the
state
of
south
carolina
to
impose
documentary
taxes
upon
these
notes
which
were
executed
in
south
carolina
by
petitioner,
a
federal
building
and
loan
association
or
whether,
on
the
other
hand,
the
state
of
south
carolina
is
inhibited
from
taxing
these
notes
by
an
--
under
section
1433
of
title
12
of
the
federal
--
of
the
u.s.c.,
federal
code.
now,
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
the
issue.
incidentally,
the
--
it
should
be
borne
in
mind,
at
least
under
our
construction
of
the
matter,
that
there
are
two
separate
statutes
involved
here.
one,
a
part
of
the
home
--
federal
home
loan
bank
act
under
which
the
federal
home
loan
bank
of
greensborough,
north
carolina
was
created,
and
there
is
an
act,
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
act
of
1933
which
is
a
subsequent
act,
an
act
under
which
federal
building
and
loan
associations
or
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
are
charted.
the
petitioner
here
was
charted
under
the
home
owners'
loan
act
of
1933.
now,
each
of
those
stat
--
those
acts
operate
within
their
own
sphere.
it
would
seem
to
us,
as
to
the
bank,
that
is,
the
federal
home
loan
bank
of
greensborough,
north
carolina
to
whom
these
notes
were
issued
by
petitioner
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
money
for
which
to
make
loans,
the
--
the
congress
has
provided
in
section
1433
in
this
--
in
this
language.
"all
notes,
debentures,
bonds
issued
by
any
bank
shall
be
exempt
from
all
taxation.
also
exempt
is
the
bank,
its
franchise,
its
capital,
reserves,
surplus,
its
advances,
and
its
income."
now,
that
is
a
provision
dealing
with
the
act
which
is
known
as
the
federal
home
--
the
federal
home
loan
bank
act.
there
is
no
waiver
of
an
exemption
in
respect
to
that
statute.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
a
--
that
it
is
an
all
inclusive
exemption
from
taxation.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
the
other
act
which
comes
into
play
here,
which
is
the
act
under
which
petitioner
was
chartered,
which
is
to
say,
the
home
owners'
act
of
1933
and
which
was
passed
subsequent
to
the
act
under
which
the
federal
home
loan
bank
of
greensborough,
north
carolina
was
created,
likewise
has
a
provision
dealing
with
the
exemption
from
taxation
within
the
confines
of
its
own
context.
there,
it
states,
under
--
in
12
--
in
1464
(h)
of
title
12,
"such
associations,
their
franchises,
capital,
reserve,
surplus,
loans,
their
income
shall
be
exempt
from
all
taxation
imposed
by
the
united
states
from
the
federal
level."
then,
it
goes
on,
"no
state,
territorial,
county,
municipal,
or
local
taxing
authority
shall
impose
any
tax
on
such
associations,
their
franchises,
capital,
reserves,
loans
or
income."
but,
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
us
and
the
--
and
was
so
construed
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
there
follows
this
language
"greater
than
imposed
by
such
authority
on
other
similar
local,
mutual
or
cooperative,
thrift
and
home
financing
institutions."
now,
that's
the
language
of
the
act
dealing
--
relating
to
the
federal
savings
and
loan
associations
of
which
petitioner
is
one.
now
--
so,
congress
has
moved
in
two
directions
under
two
separate
acts.
the
--
the
bank
--
the
statute
dealing
with
the
bank
makes
no
--
no
exception
from
exemption.
the
statute
dealing
with
the
petitioner,
federal
savings
and
loan
associations,
in
our
belief,
does
make
--
does
operate
to
waive
a
strict
and
all-inclusive
exemption.
now,
the
--
the
petitioner
contends
that
to
tax
the
notes
executed
by
it
in
south
carolina,
would
be
--
in
obtaining
these
advances,
would
be
to
tax
the
advances
of
the
bank.
that
is
--
that
is
the
theory
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner's
argument,
as
we
understand
it.
now
--
mr.
james
m.
windham
i
wouldn't
think
so,
sir,
your
honor,
except
insofar
as
there
may
be
some
interference
with
the
ultimate
use
of
the
money
for
that
purpose.
the
--
the
levy
of
the
tax,
bearing
in
mind
the
--
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
the
graniteville
case,
is
upon
the
one
creating
the
instrument.
the
petitioner,
the
federal
--
the
laurens
savings
and
loan
association,
is
the
one
that
created
the
instrument
being
taxed
here.
that
would
be
my
construction
of
a
proper
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
windham
yes,
sir?
mr.
james
m.
windham
you
say
does
the
bank
have
to
take
these
notes?
mr.
james
m.
windham
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
they
--
it
does,
sir.
we
have
reproduced
that
in
full
in
our
--
in
our
brief
in
order
that
the
whole
context
might
be
there,
sir.
mr.
james
m.
windham
in
that
--
in
that
process
of
reasoning,
in
all
honesty,
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
sir,
but
i
would
go
on
to
add
that,
if
so,
it
is
an
indirect
tax,
sir
and
not
a
direct
tax
upon
the
bank.
it
would
op
--
mr.
james
m.
windham
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
i
was
coming
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
i
would
be
--
mr.
james
m.
windham
to
answer
your
question
now,
sir,
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
ruling
in
the
pittman
case
and
the
situation
which
is
an
issue
here.
the
difference
being
that,
in
that
case,
as
at
least
according
to
my
position,
the
way
i
understand
it
can
be
differentiated
and
should
be
differentiated
is
that,
in
the
pittman
case,
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
made
a
loan
to
a
mortgager.
the
mortgager
executed
mortgage
directed
to
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation.
the
statute
provided
that
the
loans
of
the
corporation
should
be
exempt
from
taxation.
the
court
--
this
court
went
on
to
hold
that
--
that
the
mortgage
was
a
part
of
the
lending
process
of
the
home
owners'
loan
corporation
in
that
instance.
now,
your
honors,
the
--
the
difference,
may
it
please
your
honor,
as
i
would
--
would
honestly
feel
it
to
be,
is
that,
here,
you
have
a
separate
entity
coming
into
play.
that
is
to
say,
an
--
an
entirely
separate
independent
entity
so
far
as
its
creation
and
its
organization
is
concerned.
each
one
created
under
a
different
act
of
congress.
each
certainly,
it
seems
to
us,
would
be
bound
and
operative
within
the
sphere
of
the
statute
under
which
they
were
created,
under
which
they
operate.
so
that,
in
the
dif
--
the
differential
between
the
two
instances
would
be
that
the
entity
of
the
--
of
the
petitioner
here
would
create
a
situation
and
--
different,
in
fact,
from
that
which
--
which
was
involved
in
the
pittman
case.
now,
further,
the
point
i
am
--
am
trying
to
make,
and
i
believe
we
--
we
respectfully
submit
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
was
correct
in
its
adjudication
and
i
will
point
out
in
a
moment
some
additional
rulings
by
certain
courts
which
would
seem
to
give
substance
to
that
position.
the
--
these
notes
here
incidentally,
it
seems
to
us,
would
be
taxable
irrespective
of
anything
else
by
what
is
tantamount
to
a
partial
waiver
of
exemption
within
the
context
of
section
1464
(h)
of
title
12,
which
i
have
read
to
your
honors
a
moment
ago.
certainly,
if
--
if
the
language
there
does
not
amount
to
at
least
a
partial
exemption,
it
would
have
been
useless
in
our
opinion
to
have
placed
it
there.
now,
remembering
that
the
position
of
the
petitioner
here
would
be,
if
it
is
supported
and
found
to
be
correct,
that
the
--
that
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
whatever
to
have
enacted
the
provisions
of
section
1464
(h)
of
title
12
when,
under
the
previous
existent
act,
under
petitioner's
argument,
would
have
been
exempted
anyway.
so
then,
that
this
section
1464
(h)
was
enacted
subsequently
to
the
act
under
which
petitioner
would
claim
that
the
exemption
would
operate
in
its
favor
irrespective
of
anything
else.
it
was
already
provided
for.
now,
we
certainly
have
no
quarrel
with
the
fact
and
it's
been
adjudicated
numbers
of
times
that
--
that
the
congress
has
a
perfect
right
to
protect
its
--
to
create
agencies,
instrumentalities
for
carrying
on
federal
functions,
that
it
has
a
perfect
right
to
protect
those
agencies,
those
instrumentalities,
to
exempt
them
from
taxation.
but,
likewise,
we
respectfully
submit
and
is
strongly
impressed
in
the
law
is
the
fact
that
the
congress
has
a
right
to
waive
exemption
from
taxation.
we
respectfully
submit
that,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
specifically
provided
here,
there
has
been
a
waiver
on
the
part
of
congress
of
an
all-inclusive
exemption
from
taxation
in
the
enactment
of
--
of
section
1464
(h)
of
title
12.
mr.
james
m.
windham
that
is
the
contention
that
we
would
place
upon
it.
that
is,
we
believe,
the
correct
interpretation
of
it,
your
honor.
now
--
actually,
we
--
as
we
feel
it,
as
we
see
it,
we
have
not
found
any
case
which
is
dis
--
dispositive
of
this
issue
that
is
here
today.
we
do
not
feel
that
there
has
been
any
adjudication
which
would
answer
this
issue
completely.
however,
this
issue
has
the
construction,
the
operation.
section
1464
(h)
of
title
12
has
not
been
entirely
dormant
judicially.
certain
courts
and
certain
--
the
highest
courts
of
certain
--
of
our
states
have
operated
within
its
sphere
as
to
the
consideration
of
the
meaning
of
section
1464
(h)
of
title
12.
one
of
these
cases
is
one
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
arising
in
the
state
of
minnesota
where
that
--
it
was
held
there
that
in
allowing
credit
to
a
--
to
a
state
savings
and
loan
association
with
respect
to
--
to
interest
and
dividends,
that
is,
credit
against
net
income
with
respect
to
--
to
dividends
and
interest
paid
to
members
of
that
association,
was
void
as
discriminating
against
the
federal
savings
and
loan
association.
now,
that
court,
therefore,
considered
that
--
that
there
was
an
exemption
implied
in
this
provision
of
section
1464
(h).
the
court
made
this
statement,
that
is,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
made
this
statement
with
reference
to
the
purpose
of
this
provision
in
this
language.
"the
purpose
was
to
protect
federal
associations
from
discriminatory
taxation
which
would
put
them
on
any
less
favorable
basis
than
state
building
and
loan
associations."
now,
that
was
the
--
that
was
the
treatment
as
to
the
purpose
of
this
section
given
by
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
the
--
in
the
state
of
california,
there
rose
a
case
in
which
this
provision
was
likewise
considered.
that's
--
the
case
is
that
of
first
federal
savings
and
loan
association
of
altadena,
california
versus
johnson
in
which
the
eminent
present
chief
justice
of
this
court
was
listed
in
the
record
as
counsel
in
his
capacity
and
service
rendered
as
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california.
there,
now,
that
court
held
that
a
federal
savings
and
loan
association
was
not
exempt
from
a
franchise
tax
imposed
by
the
state
of
california
computed
on
the
basis
of
net
income
derived
from
investments
in
both
local
and
federal
funds.
the
holding
of
the
court
was
further,
to
the
extent
that
where
the
tax
is
not
greater
than
that
levied
on
state,
local,
industrial,
thrift
organizations
that
--
that
the
tax
was
proper.
so,
that
court,
likewise,
considered
that
there
--
that,
within
the
context
of
this
language,
there
was
a
--
a
right
given
to
impose
a
tax,
but
that
it
was
limited
by
the
--
by
the
fact
that
it
could
be
no
greater
than
that
imposed
upon
local
lending
institutions.
now,
in
effect
and
in
substance,
that
is
the
ruling.
that
is
the
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
in
this
matter.
we
will
submit
that,
in
considering
the
matter,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
likely
did
go
into
some
areas
of
consideration
which
were
not
absolutely
necessary
in
the
decision
of
the
issue
before
the
court
but,
nonetheless,
we
think,
inform
and
in
substance,
and
in
reality,
that
the
--
that
the
extent
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
ruling
is
none
other
than
to
give
realistic
consideration
to
what
is
felt
to
be,
in
our
opinion,
a
waiver
of
another
wise
all-inclusive
exemption.
we
--
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed
in
this
matter.
thank
you.
