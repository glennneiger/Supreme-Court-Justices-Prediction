justice

when
you
said
his
employment,
mr.
solicitor,
was
the
--
was
the
term
of
the
employment
formal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oral
--
oral
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
oral
negotiation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
first
boston
first
entered
the
entire
plant
action?
what
was
the
very
initiatory
step
of
first
boston?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
on
his
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
now,
this
is
the
first
time
that
you've
mentioned
this.
first
boston
--
took
it
back
to
first
boston.
first
boston
says,
"as
a
corporate
capacity,
a
corporate
capacity
other
than
proof
argumentatively
the
participation
is
sufficient,"
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
--
is
miller
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
right
that
this
is
the
first
time
to
enter
to
--
your
story
as
a
corporate
being?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
getting
to
the
point
of
--
of
liability
or
responsible
--
i
just
want
to
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
sequence
of
events.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
information
derived
from
the
--
his
superior
at
first
boston?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
miss
--
who
raised
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
if
i
understand
it
was
wenzell
who
raised
the
question
to
the
director
of
the
budget
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
he
was
the
director
who
--
who
specified
his
--
his
doubts,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
understand
--
do
i
--
am
i
right
to
infer
that
if
--
to
the
extent
that
you
can
disentangle
wenzell
from
what
conceded
between
april
3rd
and
april
10th,
you
know
that
--
in
addition
contrary
to
the
fact
but
assume
one
could
that
as
to
the
events
between
april
3rd
and
april
10th,
he
was
dissociated
from
--
from
the
governmental
activity,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
formally.
he
was
--
may
still
an
employee
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
had
no
active
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
what
was
going
on
between
april
3rd
and
april
10th,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
position
is
that
that
was
an
organic
rule
that
we
trust
repeatedly
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
infer
that
sullivan
and
cromwell
were
independent
counsels?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
first
boston?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
maybe
worth
it's
not
in
dispute
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
advice
of
both
mr.
raben
and
mr.
dean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
people
can
be
better
than
the
law,
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
leads
me
to
ask
the
question
i
am
about
to
ask.
suppose
the
first
boston
had
announced
in
the
most
emphatic
and
convincing
way
in
march,
march
1st
for
the
charging
of
the
fees,
does
the
government's
contention
would
be
different?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
--
but
i'm
right
and
i'm
assuming
you're
wrong,
that
we
must
construe
this
statute
in
this
situation
to
18
u.s.c.
434
as
though
the
case
before
us
or
the
conviction
are
for
a
criminal
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
no,
but
the
construction
of
the
statute
--
is
the
construction
of
the
statute
say
that
they
would
have
to
make
it
(inaudible)
to
criminal
conviction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
there
had
been
a
prosecution
of
mr.
wenzell
under
this
statute,
which
the
statute
would
allow,
would
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
there
might
be
good
reasons
for
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
solicitor
general
(inaudible)
properly
held
on
the
statute.
suppose
there
had
been,
would
the
focus
of
our
attention
be
different
with
that
situation
in
--
on
this
record,
where
only
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
what
--
directly,
this
all
turns
down
indirectly,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
be
giving
a
different
--
someone
writing
the
opinion,
writing
differently
as
to
what
indirectly
means
in
this
case
than
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
may
know
i
shy
off
if
i'm
talking
about
strict
constructions
from
the
statute.
that's
the
way
i've
reached
in
--
after
the
result
of
(inaudible)
strict
construction.
the
government
permits
that
he
must
carry
out
the
purpose
of
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
purposely
too
vague
depending
whether
it's
a
civil
action
or
a
criminal
action
under
the
same
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
findings
of
fact
include
the
only
findings
the
court
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
any
casualization
of
opinions
are
not
findings
of
fact
for
the
casualization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
not
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
they're
not
on
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
knew
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
a
finding,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
54,
that's
what
he
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
very
often
for
you
to
think
they're
right
and
it
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
guesswork.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
encourage
me
in
--
in
my
precision
at
least.
expert
guesses
are
often
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
were
to
enforce
purposes.
what
do
you
mean
is
the
fact
may
determine
whether
a
situation
is
brought
within
the
statute,
not
if
a
situation
is
within
the
statute
is
to
make
any
difference
whether
it
would
have
been
a
profitable
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
me,
the
conclusion
may
be
right
but
the
(inaudible)
sounds
to
me
like
a
starter,
namely,
suppose
everything
is
true,
suppose
the
president
knew
about
this,
suppose
the
director,
the
director
of
the
budget
knew
about
this,
suppose
admiral
strauss
knew
about
this,
if
in
fact,
there
was
duality
of
interest
in
the
part
of
the
negotiator
for
the
united
states,
does
he
or
does
he
come
within
the
statute?
now,
what
i
think
about
that
kind
of
wealthy
is
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
maybe
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
wasn't
addressing
myself
to
what
you
say.
i
was
addressing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
your
adoption
of
the
eloquent
from
my
friend
judge
madden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
i'm
the
worse
man
to
whom
--
on
whom
to
urge
not
only
a
denial
of
a
certiorari?
[laughter]
i'm
the
fellow
