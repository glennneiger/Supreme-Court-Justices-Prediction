mr.
william
c.
chanler
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
may
i
address
myself
to
the
unmerited
question
of
enforceability
under
the
statute?
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
this
is
clearly
a
penal
statute
that
i'm
represented
into
another
penal
statute
--
statute
against
bribery
will
be
considered.
in
the
bribery
statute,
after
some
debate,
congress
inserted
a
provision
making
contracts
sustained
by
bribery
voidable
at
the
election
of
the
president
as
drawn
originally,
they
are
absolutely
void.
when
they
adopted
434,
the
conflict
of
interest
provision,
they
put
in
no
reference
whatever
to
the
enforceability
of
contracts.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out
to
mr.
senator
president
would
introduce
the
amendment
and
the
bribery
statute
said
that
it
was
a
common
practice.
i
think
i
refer
to
rely
as
in
authority
on
mr.
justice
brennan
in
his
recent
opinion
in
kelly
against
kasuga
and
the
long
line
of
cases
that
--
that
is
based
on.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
courts
will
not
have
a
sanction
of
contract
unenforceability
to
a
penal
statute
when
congress
had
the
opportunity
of
putting
it
there
and
didn't
do
so.
it's
perfectly
saying
that
this
is
that
type
of
a
situation.
now,
as
this
court
has
also
repeatedly
held,
when
a
defense
of
illegality
of
a
contract
is
raised
based
on
an
alleged
violation
of
a
penal
statute
or
the
prohibitory
statutes
that
contains
no
sanction
of
this
kind,
the
contract
will
be
upheld
unless
the
alleged
illegality
is
so
inherent
in
the
contract
itself
or
in
the
course
of
action
that
the
contract
could
not
be
enforced
without
making
the
court
a
party
to
illegality.
now,
of
course,
a
classic
example
of
that
is
where
the
wrong
doer,
the
person
who
violated
the
statute
is
himself
suing.
and
in
the
solicitor
general's
reply
brief,
he
cites,
i
think,
five
cases
in
support
of
his
proposition
that
the
court
should
set
aside
contracts
--
the
contract
here
because
of
the
alleged
violations
of
wenzell.
of
course,
i
don't
admit
there
wasn't.
i'm
merely
trying
to
point
out
that
the
under
the
statute,
didn't
--
that
wouldn't
necessarily
make
the
contract
unenforceable.
the
solicitor
general
cites
five
cases
in
which
persons
who
had
made,
who
had
purchased
land
in
direct
violation
of
a
prohibitory
statute,
government
land
agents
who
bought
government
land,
a
public
printer
who
was
supposed
to
have
made
a
contract
with
a
corporation
in
which
he
had
an
interest
has
public
printer
in
his
private
interest,
an
order
of
premises
who
leased
it
to
himself
as
the
--
of
a
wpa
administrator.
those
are
the
cases
they
relay
on
to
saying
that
of
course
contracts
involving
a
violation
of
434
of
similar
statute
are
unenforceable.
of
course,
that's
not
this
case.
dixon-yates,
these
respondents,
hadn't
anything
to
do
with
wenzell's
activities.
they
didn't
support
him.
he
--
he
was
not
their
employee.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
and
i
shall
in
a
minute,
they
did
everything
possible
and
was
successful
in
doing
so
in
getting
him
out
before
he
could
have
possibly
been
in
the
position
of
duality.
but
his
activities
are
entirely
remote
from
the
contract
between
dixon-yates
and
the
government,
which
is
the
contract
with
which
we
are
here
dealing.
now,
your
honors
have
had
before
you,
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief
here,
i
think
you've
had
--
well,
the
court
have
had
six
cases
dealing
with
434
and
it's
only
two
with
which
the
contract
was
set
aside
were
the
ones
in
which
i
have
just
mentioned
where
the
public
printer
and
the
owner
of
real
estate
tried
to
deal
with
themselves
in
a
governmental
and
private
capacity.
in
other
words,
they
were
landlord
--
lessor
and
lessee,
lessor
in
his
private
capacity
and
lessee
for
the
government.
of
course,
that
violates
the
statute
but
he
was
the
violator.
now,
in
the
other
four
cases,
l
won't
discuss
it
here
because
i
see
there
isn't
time.
muschany,
i
think,
is
the
most
persuasive
one,
both
from
the
dissenting
side
and
the
majority
side,
as
i
read
that
case.
i
have
discussed
it
at
length
in
the
brief
here
and
you
would
find
it
i
think
at
page
72.
i
think
it's
quite
plain
that
a
--
even
where
there
was
a
violation
of
434,
even
where
a
contract
was
negotiated
by
a
government
agent
with
direct
conflict
of
interest
where
private
party
enforcing
the
contract
has
no
part
in
it,
it
wasn't
their
fault.
the
government
had
appointed
the
agent.
the
contract
was
enforced.
now,
here,
of
course,
wenzell
--
neither
wenzell
nor
first
boston
have
any
interest
in
this
lawsuit
whatever.
they
won't
gain
a
penny
by
the
enforcement
of
this
contract.
enforcement
of
this
contract
isn't
going
to
sanction
what
he
did
even
if
the
court
should
believe
that
there
was
some
technical
violation
in
his
action.
we're
not
defending
him,
we're
defending
--
we're
representing
dixon
and
yates.
and
keeping
them
--
allowing
it
then
to
enforce
this
contract
isn't
--
don't
anyway
sanction
anything
wenzell
did.
now,
the
solicitor
general
evidently
recognized
that
in
his
brief.
of
course,
he
went
off
and
said,
"well,
the
trouble
here
is
that
dixon-yates
winked
at
this
alleged
conflict
and
they
engaged
merely
in
lip
service,"
and
i
just
want
to
briefly
remind
your
honor
just
what
happened.
the
solicitor
general
indicated
a
little
of
it
but
not
all.
almost
at
the
outset,
mr.
james,
mr.
dixon's
lawyer,
went
to
mr.
dixon
in
between
and
they
went
to
wenzell
and
they
said
"here,
if
this
goes
on
and
a
contract
develops,
you
may
be
in
a
frantic
position.
you
better
talk
to
hughes,"
and
he
talked
to
hughes.
and
hughes
said,
"oh,
well,
they're
exaggerating
it.
but
talk
to
dodge
and
talk
to
your
own
people."
they
talked
to
his
own
people.
they
talked
--
first
boston
want
to
get
out
in
a
hurry
because
they
didn't
want
any
interference
when
they're
getting
this
business
later.
dodge
said,
"oh,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
to
worry
about
right
now.
there's
not
much
of
a
hurry.
it's
going
to
be
a
--
no
negotiations
for
months
but
still,
you
might
as
well
wind
up
what
you
are
doing
and
then
get
out
anyway,
if
there's
any
possibility
of
the
first
boston
will
be
in
the
picture
later."
now,
of
course
that's
true
at
that
time
in
march.
there
was
nothing.
there
was
nothing
but
a
discussion
about
a
proposal.
there
wasn't
going
to
be
any
negotiations
for
three
months.
what
did
wenzell
do
when
dodge
gave
him
the
instructions?
dodge
was
the
director
before.
he
went
to
three
more
meetings
of
the
bureau
discussing
the
earlier
proposal,
went
back
to
new
york.
he
was
called
to
washington
on
the
23rd
of
march
by
hughes
to
turn
everything
over
to
francis
adams
of
federal
power
commission,
who
was
coming
in
as
the
new
bureau
adviser.
he
did,
he
turned
everything
over
to
adams.
he
went
back
to
new
york.
he
was
still
to
come
back
to
washington
on
the
3rd
of
april.
nobody
knows
why
the
record
says
he
wasn't
heard
to
speak
to
anybody.
he
did
at
the
meeting
at
which
the
proposers
came
forth,
announced
that
they
had
new
cost
basis
and
would
make
a
new
offer
on
the
cost
basis.
wenzell
went
back
to
new
york
on
the
10th
of
april.
he
made
some
anonymous
telephone
calls
to
washington.
nobody
knows
why.
he
says
that's
what
he
keeps
his
time
terminative.
probably,
he
called
up
to
say
he
was
through
and
say
good-bye,
entertained
by
telephone
and
so,
he
resigned
by
telephone.
we
don't
know.
that's
all
he
did.
in
other
words,
what
this
winking
and
lip
service
is
so
much
obvious,
the
solicitor
general
agreed,
consisted
in
mr.
dixon's
started
the
chain
of
events
that
got
wenzell
out
before
there
was
any
possibility
of
negotiations
or
anything
of
that
sort.
now,
so
far
as
there'd
being
anything
wrong
about
what
they
did,
it
was
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
steps
which
were
initiated
to
which
going
to
--
going
to
mr.
--
to
his
administrative
superior
and
following
his
instructions
are
precisely
the
steps
that
are
laid
down
today
in
the
solicitor
general's
own
departmental
regulations
and
the
regulations
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
the
budget
--
bureau
of
the
budget
and
a
dozen
of
the
government
departments
as
to
the
proper
procedure
to
be
followed
if
a
government
employee
believes
that
he
maybe
confronted
with
a
possible
conflict
of
interest
situation.
the
regulations
say
that
he
is
to
report
to
his
administrative
superior
and
then
take
no
further
actions
except
in
accordance
to
the
directions
of
the
administrative
superior.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
now,
it
was
dixon-yates
that
initiated
those
procedures.
now,
i
must
say
that
for
the
government
now
to
come
and
say,
"there
was
something
wrong.
dixon-yates
going
to
the
government,
going
to
--
oh,
we
not
only
went
to
wenzell,
by
the
way,
when
we
found
he
hadn't
resigned
by
the
way,
mr.
dixon
and
mr.
james
went
themselves
to
hughes.
and
the
finding
there,
finding
79,
is
james
asked
hughes
how
it
was
--
wenzell
hadn't
resigned
yet.
i
think
it's
79
if
i
remember.
yes.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
their
position
is
absolutely
unimpeachable
here.
in
his
reply
brief,
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
rather
abandon
that
fact
and
he
says,
"oh,
well,
the
point
is
that
the
agreement
was
that
the
contract
is
voidable
by
the
government."
well,
i
would
like
to
say,
but
i
agree
to
the
--
if
that's
so,
your
repudiation
comes
much
too
late.
there
was
some
question
here
about
what
the
purpose
of
this
contract,
wasn't
about
the
$90,000,000
--
$100,000,000
dollar
savings.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
78,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i'm
sorry.
it's
on
page
--
record
92.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
believe
this
is
not
on
the
note.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
on
--
in
exhibit
--
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
record
here
which
is
the
hearings
of
the
joint
atomic
energy
commission
which
contained
a
letter
a
letter
written
by
the
director
of
the
budget,
hughes,
who
has
become
director,
senator
saltonstall,
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
of
the
senate
financial
committee
on
june
16th,
1954,
after
von
tresckow
and
dixon-yates
proposals
have
been
submitted
in
which
he
had
been
corresponding
senator
saltonstall
because
they
wanted
to
know
whether
they
will
justify
in
taking
the
$100,000,000
appropriation
out
of
the
budget
or
whether
they
would
--
could
rely
on
dixon-yates
or
von
tresckow
or
somebody
to
ultimately
make
the
plan
or
whether
they
had
to
use
taxpayers'
money.
the
budget
director
said,
"the
federal
government
would
be
relieved
by
this
of
the
necessity
of
providing
within
a
period
of
about
3
years
approximately
$100,000,000
out
of
tax
revenues
or
from
additions
to
the
public
debt."
that's
what
they
wanted
this
contract
for.
they
wanted
to
see
if
they
could
have
private
people
do
it.
now,
when
this
proposal
--
read
this
proposal
and
the
other
were
presenting,
they
knew
that
it
could
be
done.
they
urged
us
to
hurry,
negotiate
the
contract
but
the
contract
was
negotiated
five
months
later.
the
record
shows
they
urged
us
to
hurry
our
performance
and
we
worked,
worked,
hurried
to
get
our
performance
complete.
this
went
on
through
--
until
the
beginning
--
end
--
middle
of
july
of
1955,
which
time
we'd
spent
the
money
that
we
are
now
suing
for.
during
all
this
time,
the
government
people
themselves
knew
about
wenzell.
during
the
last
four
or
five
months
before
memphis
made
its
offer,
the
whole
wenzell
business
took
political
act
would
all
been
in
the
newspapers.
everybody
knew
about
it.
the
president
said
it
was
a
fine
contract
and
they
told
us
to
perform
at
a
hurry
and
we
did.
and
it
wasn't
until
memphis
said,
"we'll
relieve
you
and
your
budget
and
everybody
of
the
burden.
you
don't
need
to
have
dixon-yates
or
anybody
make
this
power.
we,
memphis,
will
do
it."
that's
why
they
terminated
the
contract
not
because
of
wenzell.
up
to
that
point,
they
accepted
the
benefits
of
this
contract.
they
had
balanced
their
budget.
they've
taken
$100,000,000
out
of
the
budget.
i
have
virtue
heading
this
contract.
and
it's
perfectly
absurd
to
suggest
they
ever
would
have
found
it
out
and
gone
back
for
the
$100,000,000
and
put
it
back
in
the
budget,
if
it
hadn't
been
for
memphis.
they
never
would
have
said,
"oh,
but
there
was
somebody
called
wenzell
there".
he
made
us
--
we've
got
a
fine
contract
that's
very
good
for
us
in
spite
of
it
but
nevertheless,
because
of
this
little
alleged
conflict
of
interest,
we're
going
to
get
out
of
it.
it's
absurd
to
suggest
that
they
never
would
have
done
so.
and
i
think,
your
honors,
that
i
think
that
in
a
situation
of
this
kind,
where
the
contract
is
fair
and
honest,
was
entered
into,
with
full,
free
and
honest
discussion
by
people
not
attached
with
anyway
by
wenzell
or
anything
else.
when
wenzell's
position
himself
was
purported
to
the
government
and
his
removal
brought
about
by
these
private
contractors.
i
suggest
that
under
those
circumstances,
public
policy,
which
would
be
only
test
here
under
434,
public
policy
requires
that
the
government's
honest
contract
be
enforced.
