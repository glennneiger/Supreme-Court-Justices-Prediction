are
these
the
only
dates
in
wenzell's

you
think
we
should
be
interested?
chief

earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
seemed
to
me
that
solicitor
general
gave
us
number,
rather
dates
between
january
18th
and
april
3rd
that
--
in
which
mr.

did
certain
things
that
were
more
active
than
just
went
to
washington.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
--
i
just
--
i
just
wondered
that
there
weren't
other
dates
in
there
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
explanation
as
to
why
--
as
to
why
this
would
be
better
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
contend
that
if
tva
built
it
for
$100,000,000
that
that
would
be
a
total
loss
for
the
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
how
do
they
save
$100,000,000?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
they
just
delayed
--
delayed
the
cost,
didn't
they?
