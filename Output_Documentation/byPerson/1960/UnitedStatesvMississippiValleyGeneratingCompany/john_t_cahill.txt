mr.
john
t.
cahill
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chanler
and
i
appear
on
behalf
of
respondent.
we've
allocated
our
hour
between
this.
i
will
take
50
minutes
of
the
hour,
mr.
chanler
will
close
with
10.
now,
i
have
three
charts,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
will
ask
that
they'd
be
handed
up.
it's
because
the
timetable,
the
chronology
of
events
here
is
important.
in
my
first
chart,
we'll
go
to
the
principal
dates
in
this
matter
based
on
the
undisputed
court
of
claims
findings
of
fact.
i
might
say,
well,
the
charts
are
being
handed
up
that
--
not
only
does
the
government
concede
affirmatively
here
that
there's
been
no
fraud
or
corruption
by
anybody
at
any
time
in
this
transaction
but
they
further
concede
that
the
contract
has
"a
fair
and
honest
contract".
now,
that
was
so
conceded
in
open
court
upon
the
trial
of
the
action.
this
contract
--
the
finding
say
was
negotiated
over
four
months
by
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
proposal
was
to
the
atomic
energy
commission.
my
friend
fell
into
error.
with
14
different
people
on
the
aec
negotiating
team
founds
specifically
by
commissioner
collin
to
have
been
a
competent
and
aggressive
staff
of
negotiators.
commissioner
collin
further
went
on.
and
i
may
say
that
although
there
was
a
dissent
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
dissenting
judges
did
not
dissent
on
the
finding,
so
that
they're
unanimous
in
their
affirmance
before
you.
they
found
that
these
negotiations
had
been
"lengthy,
odious
and
hotly
contested".
there
were
15
negotiating
sessions,
so
formed
minutes
were
kept
of
them.
there
were
other
minutes
--
there
were
other
meetings
where
the
minutes
were
not
kept.
before
the
joint
committee
of
the
house
and
the
senate
on
atomic
energy,
mr.
nichols,
the
general
manager
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
produced
a
chart
of
25
changes
all
important
to
the
government,
he
said,
including
the
tva
changes
that
had
been
the
result
of
the
contracted
negotiations
in
suing
on
the
april
10th
proposal
returning
to
the
beginning
of
this
first
chart
on
the
principal
dates
because
i
think
that
it
brings
out
the
chronology
here
very
well.
we
have
december
23rd,
1953,
mr.
dixon's
first
meeting
on
this
matter
with
adams
and
strauss,
mr.
nichols
and
mr.
williams,
manager
and
assistant
general
manager
of
the
aec
in
washington.
now,
we
come
to
the
period
of
wenzell's
unpaid
part-time
consultancy
to
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
which
was
requested
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
--
not
by
us
but
by
the
bureau
of
the
budget.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
sure.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
but
may
i
speak
to
that?
mr.
john
t.
cahill
but
we
say
in
our
main
brief,
it
is
not
facetious
that
the
(inaudible)
statement
facts
of
the
government's
brief
must
not
have
been
acquainted
with
the
man
who
wrote
the
argument,
in
the
government
brief.
and
i
shall
--
i
hope
to
demonstrate
rather
sharply
in
the
reply
brief
that
the
disparity
between
that
concession
and
what
has
been
argued
here
is
egregious
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
a
very
short
order.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
as
a
matter
of
record,
that
is
so.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that
is
right
and
they're
unanimous
before
your
honor.
the
--
all
five
of
the
judges
below
upheld
the
findings
of
commissioner
collin.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
right,
sir.
now,
we
have
the
date
of
january
18th,
1954
when
wenzell
came
to
washington
having
been
called
by
hughes,
then
assistant
director,
later
director
of
the
budget.
we
have
february
25th,
the
sponsors'
first
proposal
to
the
atomic
energy
commission.
everyone
of
this
is
backed
up
by
a
finding.
march
16th,
wenzell's
consultancy
effectively
ended.
now,
what
we
mean
by
that
was
that
at
that
date,
he
went
back
to
new
york.
and
thereafter,
his
only
job
was
to
turnover
to
adams,
who
was
the
director
of
the
power
bureau
of
the
federal
power
commission,
such
papers
as
he
had
and
to
be
sure
that
adams
knew
what
he
knew
about
this
question
of
the
cost
of
money.
march
26th,
the
findings
say
started
the
preparation
of
the
detailed
cost
estimates
for
the
april
10th
proposal.
wenzell
did
not
participate.
that
is
undisputed.
april
3rd,
the
commissioner
found
the
consultancy
of
--
wenzell
concluded.
april
12th,
we
submitted
the
mvg
proposal
to
the
aec,
the
one
that
was
dated
april
10th,
april
12th
to
24th,
intensive
review
and
analysis,
both
by
the
aec
and
the
tva
of
our
april
10th
proposal.
april
28th,
von
tresckow
announced
his
proposal.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
they're
all
of
record.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
no,
they're
not
on
the
chart
that
you
have
before
your
honor
because
they
have
no
relation
with
what
ultimately
happened.
i'm
just
filing
in
because
some
of
these
things
are
gaps
that
my
friend
unfortunately
did
not
have
the
time
to
cover.
the
finding,
for
example,
on
may
the
12th,
and
it
was
of
may
12th,
the
agreement
as
to
the
financial
agency
was
concluded
with
first
boston
and
lehman
brothers.
on
may
27th,
the
competitive
proposal
of
von
tresckow
was
received.
and
on
june
14th,
president
eisenhower
decided
on
the
basis
of
comparative
analysis
of
our
april
the
10th
proposal
and
the
competing
von
tresckow
proposal
to
direct
negotiations
be
done
with
us.
now,
we
have
here
a
(inaudible)
from
april
3rd
to
june
30th,
when,
for
the
first
time,
we
were
informed
of
president
eisenhower's
decision
that
negotiations
should
be
had
with
us
through
--
with
the
competitors.
so
that
on
july
11th,
we
had
the
commencement
of
negotiations
of
the
power
contract
with
the
atomic
energy
commission.
on
july
14th,
our
proposal
of
april
10th
was
printed
in
the
congressional
record.
on
august
18th,
the
august
11th
proof
of
our
power
contract
was
sent
to
the
joint
committee
of
the
house
and
senate
on
atomic
energy.
and
i
might
say
that
the
contract
was
not
effective
until
after
extensive
hearings
had
be
held,
been
held
before
that
committee.
and
they
adopted
a
resolution
in
november
when
this
contract
was
executed,
holding
that
this
was
a
good
contract
and
in
the
public
interest
and
that
many
changes
had
been
made
in
it
to
the
benefit
of
the
american
people.
on
october
5th,
we
received
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
--
a
favorable
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
not
--
not
at
this
time.
i'm
coming
to
that
if
i
may.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
yes,
it
was.
and
that's
the
part
i
shall
deal
with
explicitly
where
i
say
that
my
friend's
agreement
with
the
findings
of
fact
are
so
much
of
variance
especially
with
his
reply
brief.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
it
was
known
by
the
government.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
well,
take
for
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
he
came
to
view
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
--
he
came
to
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
i
can't
speak
as
the
congressional
committee.
i
can't
speak
as
the
negotiating
agencies
because
it
came
to
the
bureau
of
the
budget
of
request
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
--
of
hughes.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
and
they
--
mr.
hughes
knew
he
was
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
--
first
boston
when
he
went
over
the
atomic
energy
commission
and
your
honor
knows
what
security
precautions
they
have.
every
time
he
signed
in,
he
puts
down
wenzell,
first
boston
on
broadway,
new
york
city.
the
finding
is
that
admiral
strauss
knew
he
was
first
boston.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
so
then,
we
come
to
october
the
6th
where
the
atomic
energy
commission
reported
to
the
joint
committee
of
the
congress
that
the
october
1st
proof
of
contract
had
been
approved
by
the
aec,
which
had
received
favorable
letters
from
the
federal
power
commission,
general
accounting
office,
tennessee
valley
authority,
bureau
of
the
budget,
chief
of
engineers
and
general
council
of
the
aec.
now,
to
show
you
that
this
thing
was
not
frozen,
there's
affirmative
finding
that
as
late
as
the
night
before
this
contract
was
executed
at
november
10th,
it
was
doubtful
"whether
there
would
be
a
contract"
because
at
that
time,
demands
were
made
upon
us
by
the
negotiating
agencies
to
which
we
were
not
sure
that
we
could
exceed.
and
last,
the
execution
delivery
on
november
11th
after
this
long
period
of
four
months
of
strenuous
negotiation,
lengthy,
odious
and
hotly
contested
as
the
finding
say,
we
have
the
contract.
now,
we
turn
to
the
second
chart,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that's
all,
your
honor.
absolutely
nothing
else,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that
is
it.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
deal
with
what
mr.
wenzell
did
during
this
period
of
time.remember,
there's
only
a
part-time
occupancy
with
them.
and
it
was
unpaid.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
there
are
other
dates,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
they're
all
to
the
common
point
which
i'm
about
to
deal
with
now,
namely
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
--
the
title
on
the
second
chart,
“from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims,
the
cost
of
money
was
determined
by
forces
beyond
the
control
of
the
contracting
parties.”
mr.
john
t.
cahill
no,
that's
from
the
opinion.
now,
the
court
of
claims
says
that
wenzell
was
a
fifth
column
planted
on
us
by
the
government.
apparently,
what
the
government
contends
here
was
that
wenzell
was
a
fifth
column
planted
by
first
boston
on
the
government.
that
seems
to
be
the
thrust
of
their
argument.
now,
the
thing
that
wenzell
is
supposed
to
have
prolonged
from
the
government
is
this
mystical
information
that
this
project
could
be
financed.
so
he
forecast
for
3.50
cost
of
money.
now,
that
seems
to
be
the
constant
because
it
goes
all
through
their
brief
and
the
reply
brief.
and
so
just
to
show
how
much
in
error
that
is
as
a
fundamental
assumption,
i
plotted
from
the
federal
reserve
bulletins
for
52,
53
and
54,
the
yields
on
triple
a
bonds
and
the
yields
on
the
aa
bonds.
your
honors,
we'll
see
that
the
money
market,
part
from
being
a
constant,
gyrated
during
that
period
like
a
fee
of
the
charge.
now
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
yes,
fairly
studied
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
wasn't
the
judgment
of
wenzell
of
first
boston
that
counted.
it
was
even
the
judgment
of
the
budget
bureau
or
the
aec.
it's
the
judgment
of
the
lenders
as
to
what
they
can
get
for
their
money.
and
when
you're
going
to
borrow
an
excess
of
$100,000,000
and
you're
going
to
the
big
institutional
lenders
such
as
the
metropolitan
life
or
the
prudential,
the
two
companies
that
committed
to
lend
here,
it's
what
those
financial
vice
presidents
think
they
can
get
from
competing
applicants
for
the
money
and
it
turned
out
that
wenzell
was
wrong.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that
is
true.
but
i'm
trying
to
show
you
how
much
in
the
field
of
the
prophecy
of
the
farmer's
almanac.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
yes,
on
the
gallop
hole,
mr.
wenzell
was
in
his
prophecy
of
3.50.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
i
agree
completely.
i
--
i'd
like
to
call
the
attention
to
finding
102,
where
a
reference
is
made.
that's
record
to
103
and
104
to
a
meeting
between
dixon
and
nichols,
then
general
manager
of
the
aec.
and
i'd
like
to
read
this
finding.
during
that
meeting,
dixon
said
that
the
best
informed
judgment
which
the
sponsors
had
been
able
to
indicate
--
to
obtain
indicated
that
the
interest
charges
on
the
debt
money
would
be
3.5
percent.
but
he
further
stated
that
if
it
developed,
that
responses
had
to
pay
a
higher
rate,
he
would
expect
the
government
to
reimburse
the
sponsors
for
the
additional
interest
costs.
on
the
other
hand,
nichols
took
the
position
that
if
the
actual
cost
of
money
to
the
sponsors
was
less
than
3.5
percent,
he
would
expect
to
reopen
the
question
of
costs
so
that
the
government
would
obtain
the
benefit
of
the
lower
rate.
the
cost
of
money
to
which
both
nixon
and
nichols
referred
is
not
a
static
figure
but
varies
from
day
to
day
and
sometimes
from
hour
to
hour
in
accordance
with
the
ups
and
downs
of
the
market.
as
well
--
here
--
here
and
after
appear,
the
actual
cost
of
the
money
borrowed
was
3.58
percent
for
mvg's
bonds
and
3.25
percent
for
its
notes.
in
fact,
as
the
court
of
claim
said,
this
agreement
--
this
information
as
to
the
cost
of
money
was
such
tangible
information
that
“a
few
well-placed
telephone
calls
by
any
responsible
person
would
probably
have
to
obtained
such
information.”
now,
that's
what
the
case
is
about.
and
that's
what
mr.
wenzell
who
came
here
to
do
a
patriotic
duty
he's
accused
of
doing.
now,
just
to
show
how
far
wrong
he
was,
i
take
my
third
and
last
chart.
we
have
here,
at
the
first
line,
the
wenzell-first
boston
interest
estimate,
3.50,
the
actual
interest
cost,
3.58.
on
the
mvg
commitment,
the
25-year
bonds
of
$104,448,000,
the
excess
of
actual
interest
over
estimate
on
the
life
of
the
bonds
is
over
$2,000,000.
now,
we
had
the
right
under
the
contract
to
go
back
and
reopen
it
with
the
atomic
energy
commission
because
of
that
excess
of
payment.
we
who
are
supposed
to
have
been
so
greedy
could
have
done
that.
the
findings
are
that
dixon
said
when
he
first
came
down
here
that
we
were
willing
to
do
this
business
without
regard
to
profit
that
we
were
willing
to
take
any
rate
of
return
that
the
federal
power
commission
gave.
the
further
fact
is
we
agreed
that
our
losses
would
be
limitless
on
this
contract
when
we
agreed
to
a
ci
of
$600,000
a
year
on
our
profit.
and
we
agreed
that
in
many
years,
it
went
over
$600,000,
we
put
it
in
the
(inaudible).
so
it
went
on
to
$600,000
on
another
year,
they
could
use
to
make
it
up.
at
the
end
of
the
25-year
power
contract,
who
got
the
excess?
not
we,
the
atomic
energy
commission,
the
united
states
government.
that's
how
fair
and
honest
this
contract
was.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
surely,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
in
no
respect.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
no.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
completely
so,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
excuse
me?
mr.
john
t.
cahill
yes,
i
think
it
would.
i
think
it
would
because
i
think
that
where
you
admit
that
there's
no
fraud,
i
think
that's
an
important
point.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
no,
no.
we'll
just
see
--
i
don't
want
to
get
to
that
point
of
enforceability
because
that's
the
last
point
of
my
argument
and
i
will
say
this.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
alright.
but
i
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
[laughs]
just
for
a
minute
if
you'll
allow
me.
those
cases
of
non
--
unenforceability
where
the
illegality
is
so
inherent
in
the
contract,
for
the
court
to
enforce
it,
it
would
make
the
court
an
agent
for
the
criminal
act.
that's
generically
the
argument
but
i
hope
they
develop
that
more
at
length
as
i
get
to
the
point.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
i
accept
a
better
statement
within
my
position.
now,
when
we're
all
through
this
extensive
record
and
the
government
left
no
stone
unturned
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
we
come
up
with
two
things
which
wenzell
did
are
two
only.
both
upon
the
instructions
of
mr.
hughes
of
the
budget
bureau,
one
he
acted
as
an
expediter
because
the
government
had
to
have
this
power
and
had
to
have
it
by
1957
and
that
was
of
the
essence
to
the
national
security.
the
other
thing
about
which
heard
--
we've
heard
so
much,
he
got
from
his
banking
firm,
first
boston
estimates
as
to
the
probable
interest
rates
which
would
have
to
be
paid
on
the
money
bar
to
finance
the
project.
now,
on
the
assumed
probable
interest
rate
that
wenzell
was
conveying
to
both
petitioner
and
respondent,
and
he
respond
for
the
direction
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
the
finding
is,
and
i
read
it,
record
76,
finding
55,
"the
object
was
to
obtain
the
best
possible
and
to
get
a
figure
which
would
not
only
be
used
by
dixon
but
would
be
known
to
the
bureau,
so
that
both
would
be
talking
about
one
in
the
same
factor,"
end
of
the
finding.
now,
wenzell's
activities
were
confined
to
this
single
question.
where
--
what
the
government
wanted
to
know
was
that
dixon-yates
were
talking
about
the
same
realistic
interest
rate
that
the
government
was
talking
about,
as
to
whether
there
could
be
some
figure
that
would
form
the
basis
of
the
start
of
negotiations.
now,
curiously
enough,
if
mr.
wenzell
was
a
fifth
columnist
planted
by
us
on
the
government,
he
concurred
that
the
february
25th
proposal,
the
sponsors
was
too
high
and
that
it
should
be
rejected.
that
was
a
strange
behavior
indeed,
if
he
was
in
anyway
a
fifth
columnist
and
--
in
answer
to
the
question
that
you
put
me,
mr.
justice
stewart,
as
to
whether
the
findings
are
unchallenged.
i
want
to
make
just
one
point
to
show
you
the
difference
between
the
state
of
their
own
challenge
and
the
actuality,
and
i'll
ask
you
to
turn
to
page
35
of
the
government's
reply
brief
which
the
solicitor
general
used
extensively
in
argument.
35,
the
last
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
now,
at
this
point,
the
solicitor
general
made
time
after
time
after
time
in
the
cause
of
his
argument.
the
sentence
reads,
from
page
35
of
the
government's
reply,
"but
the
government
was
unaware
of
the
retention
of
first
boston
and
thus,
the
fruition
of
the
conflict
of
interest
during
the
entire
period
of
contract
negotiations
from
july
7th
until
november
11th
and
did
not
learn
of
the
retention
until
february
18th,
1955."
now,
it's
interesting
to
note,
first,
that
the
government
recognizes
that
the
period
of
negotiation
did
not
begin
until
july
7th
but
what
the
government
refuses
to
recognize
is
the
expressed
finding
by
the
court
below,
unanimous
finding
that
on
the
very
first
day
of
negotiations,
the
sponsors'
negotiators
disclosed
the
atomic
energy
commission
that
first
boston
had
been
retained
as
financial
agent.
now,
let
me
ask
you
the
term
of
finding
126,
appearing
at
page
117
of
the
record.
that
finding
reads
as
follows,
"on
july
7th,
1954,
during
the
negotiation
of
the
contract,
the
aec
representatives
were
informed
that
first
boston
and
lehman
brothers
were
acting
as
financial
agents
to
the
sponsors."
now,
could
there
be
a
greater
and
more
diametrical
variance
between
the
main
theme
of
the
government's
argument
in
this
court
and
the
unchallenged
finding
which
i
have
just
read.
now,
the
lawyers
who
tried
this
case
for
the
government
were
able
lawyers
if
i
know
for
well
that
this
conflict
of
interest
defense
depended
upon
a
conclusion
that
wenzell
have
the
kind
of
a
present
pecuniary
interest
which
is
prohibited
by
section
434,
face
had
been
at
voluminous
proposed
finding
flaw,
counter
findings
to
us
asking
for
a
finding
that
wenzell
had
a
present
pecuniary
interest
during
the
time
he
was
a
consultant
to
the
bureau
of
the
budget.
they
failed
to
get
that
finding.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
never
(voice
overlap)
any
objection
of
it.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
no,
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
boston's
interest
to
have
a
high
price
pay.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
our
--
our
interest
here
was
in
common
with
that
of
the
united
states.
our
interest
is
the
same
on
all
the
sides.
this
argument
is
switching
hubs.
i
think
thus
discredits
this
man
who
was
doing
a
patriotic
service.
we
were
all
interested
in
doing
this
without
limitation
of
lawsuit
and
that
was
so
expressed.
we
took
the
responsibility,
therefore,
whatever
was
done
here
we
were
all
on
one
side
trying
to
see
if
president
eisenhower's
message
on
the
state
of
the
union,
on
the
partnership
between
business
and
government
in
this
field
could
be
carried
out
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
--
the
proposed
division
between
--
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
no,
mr.
justice,
their
interest
is
on
a
fair
contract
being
negotiated
because
of
(inaudible)
and
if
it
weren't
a
realistic
figure,
they
couldn't
bar
from
the
constitutional
method
to
a
very
sophisticated
(inaudible)
so
we
all
were
at
one.
and
that
rejection
in
february
25th
was
on
the
cost
estimate.
the
3.50
interest
rate
was
the
same
in
the
february
25th
proposal
and
in
the
april
10th.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that's
right.
those
are
constant
throughout.
now,
i
say
that
the
petitioner
here
draws
a
very
long
bow
in
his
brief
when
he
says
that
prior
to
wenzell's
leaving
the
government,
first
boston
did
not
have
an
outright
commitment
and
i
quote
their
brief
regarding
the
financing.
now,
no
finding
supports
that
statement.
the
court
below
said
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
that
first
boston
had
any
agreement
or
commitment,
written
or
oral,
formal
or
informal,
contingent
or
otherwise
that
in
the
event
of
the
proposal
which
was
in
preparation
when
wenzell's
government
employment
ended
should
result
in
negotiations
which
shouldn't
the
course
of
events
resulted
in
a
contract,
first
boston
will
give
them
the
opportunity
to
earn
a
commission
by
selling
the
bonds
of
the
corporation
which
will
be
form
to
sign
and
perform
the
contract.
the
evidence
is
perfectly
plain
that
there
was
no
such
agreement
of
understanding
as
we
have
seen
a
month
after
wenzell's
government
employment
terminated,
dixon-yates
felt
perfectly
free
to
get
the
bond
selling
business
to
whom
so
ever
it
pleased
and
they
did.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
no,
i'm
quoting
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
no,
that's
--
that's
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
it's
--
it's
an
accurate
summary
of
the
findings.
now,
after
first
boston
was
retained,
two
of
its
principle
financial
officers
determined
that
there
should
be
no
fee.
mr.
george
woods
testified
that
he
made
that
determination
as
early
as
may
of
1954.
you'll
find
that,
your
honors,
on
page
113
of
the
record
beginning
in
the
last
paragraph
of
finding
116.
it
begins,
you
see,
with
the
detainer
on
may
12th,
1954
and
then
picking
up
in
117.
it
says,
"during
the
period
between
may
25th
and
the
middle
of
june
1954,
woods,
in
several
conversation
with
linsley,
he
was
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
of
first
boston,
took
the
position
that
it
would
be
the
better
policy
the
first
boston
not
to
charge
a
fee
for
its
services
and
financial
agents
for
the
sponsors.
linsley
agreed
with
woods
about
june
15th,
1954.
it's
long
before
the
contract.
woods'
telephoned
dean,
that's
arthur
dean
of
sullivan
and
cromwell,
stating
that
first
boston
had
decided,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
not
to
charge
any
fee.
now,
it's
not
1955.
i'm
afraid
the
solicitor
general
fell
into
unconscious
error.
its
back
in
may
and
june
of
1954
long
before
the
contract
was
executed
to
that
decision
to
do
this
as
a
matter
of
public
service
was
made
and
that
is
the
finding,
unchallenged
in
this
court.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
well,
i
think
since
first
boston's
lawyers
felt
that
we
have
gotten
ourselves
and
trained
in
what
the
court
below
describes
as
a
free-for-all
fight
between
private
power
and
public
power
and
i'm
accurately
with
no
holds
barred.
the
majority
opinion
said
that
as
a
matter
of
policy
for
the
good
of
the
cause,
they
ought
to
wave
their
fee
and
they
did
and
they
did
it
then.
and
that
is
the
finding
and
that
there,
as
early
as
that.
and
that
finding
is
uncontested.
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
wenzell
to
have
an
indirect
pecuniary
interest
when
--
when
first
boston
had
itself,
had
no
direct
pecuniary
interest.
now,
if
i
have
a
minute,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
contract
itself.
the
policy
of
having
a
contract
such
as
this
was
common
to
both
the
truman
and
the
eisenhower
administrations.
the
congress
concurred.
it
was
a
policy
which
the
court
below
finds
that
wenzell
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
determining.
president
truman
determined
it,
president
eisenhower
determined
it.
now,
that
policy
was
that
tva
should
not
have
$100,000,000
of
federal
funds
for
the
construction
of
its
proposed
power
plants
at
fulton,
tennessee.
on
spring
of
1953,
and
again
in
1954,
efforts
made
at
the
budget
for
the
tva
fulton
plant
but
they
were
defeated
in
the
congress.
and
again
in
1955,
the
bureau
of
the
budget
eliminated
the
tva
request
for
that
construction.
now,
another
fact
in
regarding
the
contract
is
that
there
has
never
been
in
the
history
of
contract
laws
respectfully
submit
a
contract
negotiated
under
declare
of
such
merciless
publicity
as
this
one
was.
it
was
scrutinized,
saved
and
analyzed
from
every
angle
where
the
negotiating
team
for
the
government
had
the
advantage
of
drawing
on
men
of
so
many
different
sympathies
ranging
from
complete
sympathy
with
the
president's
policy
to
complete
hostility
with
it.
now,
in
addition
to
the
--
likely
negotiations
by
the
aec
are
referred
to
the
decisions
of
the
president
who
after
all
this
wenzell
episode
came
out
called,
and
the
record
shows
this
dixon
to
the
white
house
and
he
said,
"i'm
glad
to
meet
an
american
who
can
take
it
on
the
chin
as
well
as
i
think
i
can.
and
then
he
was
asked
thereafter
after
this
wenzell
business
came
out,
did
he
think
that
wenzell
had
done
nothing
wrong?
he
said,
"indeed,
i
don't."
i
think
it
was
a
fair
contract.
so
in
addition
to
the
recommendations
of
the
president
of
the
united
states,
we
have
the
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
and
below
we
have
to
meet
an
attempt
to
repudiated
in
one
of
the
defenses
or
written
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
we
have
the
department
of
justice,
the
federal
power
commission,
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
the
comptroller
general's
office,
the
sec,
the
aec,
the
joint
committee
of
the
congress
and
last
but
by
no
means
least,
the
congress
itself
because
in
order
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
this
contract
was
valid,
the
congress
amended
the
atomic
energy
act
and
added
section
164
primarily
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
authorizing
the
contract
here.
now,
we
seek
not
a
penny
of
problem
in
this
action
for
breach
of
contract,
although
the
federal
government
has
saved
$100,000,000
by
our
action.
we
seek
to
recover
only
for
our
out-of-pocket
costs
and
we've
been
minimizing
more
along
the
line
as
we've
been
able
to
sell
off
equipment
which
we
have
bought
but
had
no
longer
any
useful.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
because
the
purpose
of
the
tva
was
to
secure
an
appropriation
of
a
$100,000,000
to
be
put
in
the
budget
for
the
construction
of
the
plant
at
fulton,
tennessee.
and
it
was
after
both
president
truman
and
president
eisenhower
decided
it
should
not
be
done.
they
decided
that
it
was
feasible
to
build
this
plant
and
the
price
of
invested
capital
should
be
built
that
way.
therefore,
we
did
it.
and
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
own
mind,
as
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
may
have
indicated
that
memphis
hadn't
stepped
up
and
said
that
it's
municipal
electric
authority
would
build
this
plant
that
the
performance
of
the
dixon-yates
contract
would
have
gone
through.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
no,
i
don't
think
it
cost
memphis'
hands.
i
think
it
was
fortuitous
that
memphis
stepped
in.
and
when
memphis
stepped
in,
that
was
the
costs
assigned
to
us
for
the
termination
of
this
contract
but
there
was
no
longer
any
need
for
our
contract.
that's
all
we
were
told,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
it
was
until
months
later
that
we
were
told
that
it
was
no
longer
an
obligation
of
the
united
states.
we
were
preceding
unsettlement
negotiations
time
to
proceed
like
lawyers
to
wind
up
that
which
have
proved
to
be
a
frustrated
transaction.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
because
the
moneys
that
actually
went
out
was
not
federal
government
money.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that's
it.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
that's
right.
yes,
not
u.s.
government.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
no,
that
didn't
make
it
unnecessary
for
the
government
to
do
so.
it
made
unnecessary
for
us
to
do
so
because
the
credit
of
the
united
states
was
not
pledged
on
our
debt.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
we
were
not.
we
were
doing
at
the
premises
of
mississippi
valley
generating.
the
obligation
here
was
an
obligation
of
that
corporation
under
which
dixon
and
yates
were
contributing
capital
from
there
companies
and
borrowing
money
secured
under
25-year
power
contract
with
the
atomic
energy
commission.
so
it's
not
government
money
and
it
was
not
government
credit.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
it's
certainly
not.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
well,
they
save
--
save
the
outlay
on
the
budget
of
that
amount
of
capital
funds,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
that
time,
the
--
(voice
overlap)
--
the
appropriation
was
fearlessly
close
to
the
--
to
the
top
debt
amendment
of
the
united
states.
this
was
a
much
bruited
point
at
that
time.
mr.
john
t.
cahill
oh,
no,
your
honor,
they
saved
it
because
they
never
had
to
put
out
$100,000,000
of
united
states'
money.
the
money
that
went
out,
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
ultimately,
was
the
money
of
the
city
of
memphis.
now,
enclosing,
if
i
may,
the
court
below
well
characterizes
the
defenses,
events
in
this
case
which
the
court
below
said
the
government's
case
is
essentially
a
cynical
case.
and
that
is
the
language
of
the
court
below.
it
says
the
government
urges,
and
i'm
quoting,
in
effect,
that
the
doctrine
which
calls
to
its
defense
is
a
prophylactic
generalization
which
must
be
applied
in
cases
of
honest
transactions
in
order
to
keep
it
available
and
effective
in
cases
of
dishonest
transactions.
the
point
is
that
the
government,
like
the
infant
and
the
idiot,
must
have
the
protection
of
a
broad
legal
incapacity.
in
this
case,
the
act
of
the
united
states
with
the
director
of
the
budget
acted
immediately
under
and
on
behalf
of
the
president
of
united
states.
what
he
did
was
done
legally,
honestly
and
with
complete
fidelity
to
the
interest
of
the
government.
the
power
of
even
the
government's
highest
officials
are
defined
by
statute.
we
do
not
see
in
the
case
before
as
an
instance
in
which
the
government
needs
as
additional
protection
against
the
honest
acts
of
its
highest
officials,
a
diaphanous
cloak
of
immunity
woven
from
asserted
day,
an
unedifying
public
policy.
and
the
leading
newspaper
of
this
country
which
supports
this
contract
hard
and
fast
said,
"after
the
decision
was
made
to
abrogate
it
and
not
to
pass
our
out-of-pocket
costs,
it
seems
to
us,
as
a
matter
of
common
honesty,
in
no
way
connected
with
the
public
policies,
to
shove
its
faith
and
meet
this
obligation,
otherwise
how
much
is
the
government
contract
worth?"

in

you

mr.

you
understand
my
position,
my
answer
to
mr.

black.
there
was

and
in

second

your

denied
certiorari
in

case
last
monday.
now,
i
don't
know
if
the
ground
of
the
denial
have
cert
naturally
but
i
--
i
got
out
the
briefs
in
that
case
and
the
point
seemed
to
be
forcefully
made
that
the
interest
of
this
individual
which
was
sought
to
be
the
basis
of
disaffirmance
of
the
contract
had
been
known
to
the
government
contracting
officers
from
the
beginning
which
is
precisely
the
point
here.
mr.

just

i

wanted

homework.
i
read
that.
thank
you
very
much.
