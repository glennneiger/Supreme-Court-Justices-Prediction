mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
action
involves
the
contract
generally
--
which
it
generally
been
called
the
dixon-yates
contract.
it
goes
back
to
the
year
1954.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
involved
which
would
be
a
ground
for
disaffirming
or
declaring
the
contract
unenforceable.
in
1953,
a
question
came
up
in
this
administration
about
whether
the
proposal
of
the
tva
to
build
a
new
plant
at
fulton,
tennessee
steam
plant,
involving
a
large
investment
of
government
money
should
be
approved.
it
was
included
in
the
budget
of
president
truman.
and
the
problem
that
the
budget
director,
mr.
dodge
had
was
a
question
of
a
debt
of
lehman
and
whether
or
not
this
--
this
proposal
should
be
approved
or
some
new
or
different
should
be
made
with
regard
to
the
handling
of
the
power
needs
in
that
area.
the
atomic
energy
commission
needed
additional
power
for
its
plant
at
paducah.
we've
no
question
about
that.
and
it
had
been
serviced
by
the
tva.
the
demands
of
the
memphis
area
were
such
that
they
run
the
neighborhood
of
400,000
kilowatts
and
therefore,
some
additional
provision
had
to
be
made
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
additional
requirements
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
in
considering
this
problem,
mr.
dodge
talked
to
mr.
woods,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
first
boston
corporation
who
was
the
employer
of
mr.
wenzell
who
will
be
described
in
this
controversy
and
was
the
person
who
was
--
the
government
claims
is
involved
in
the
conflict
of
interest
in
this
case.
mr.
wenzell
was
a
vice
president,
a
director
and
his
wife
owned
200
shares
of
the
stock
of
first
boston
corporation.
mr.
woods,
in
may
of
1953,
suggested
that
the
budget
director
hire
mr.
wenzell
to
make
a
study
of
the
tva
in
its
cost
and
see
what
could
be
recommended
to
the
government.
this
study
was
made
and
the
only
bearing
that
it
has
on
the
matter
before
the
court
is
that
mr.
wenzell
obtained
information
and
knowledge
about
tva
and
its
cost
and
so
forth
that
its
fair
inference
could
have
been
used
and
probably
was
in
connection
with
the
subsequent
contract
with
dixon-yates.
that
he
made
the
study
and
that
he
exhibited
to
mr.
woods,
chairman
of
the
board
in
his
corporation
without
the
permission
of
the
juror
of
bureau
of
the
budget
and
they
discovered
it
later.
then,
when
the
government
thought
that
provision
should
be
made
to
try
to
obtain
a
contract
for
the
furnishing
of
electricity
by
the
private
utility,
mr.
hughes
suggested
and
called
upon
mr.
wenzell
to
come
and
advise
the
government
in
regard
to
that,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
cost
of
money.
and
in
january
of
1954,
mr.
wenzell's
action
runs
from
january
of
1954
through
april
10th
as
employee
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget
in
regard
to
the
dixon-yates
contract.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there's
no
question
of
what
it
was.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
was
known,
all
the
way
through.
it
was
not
--
it
was
known
to
aec,
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
too.
they
did
not
know
of
his
employment
by
budget,
that
is
the
atomic
energy
commission,
that
was
the
contract
in
agency,
until
considerably
later
period
after
april
10th
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
did
not,
but
the
bureau
of
the
budget
did
both
mr.
dodge
and
mr.
hughes.
it's
the
position
of
the
government
that
they
could
not
waive
the
statute
and
whatever
they
knew
in
regard
to
his
action,
they
had
no
power
to
set
aside
the
will
of
the
congress.
now,
i'll
try
to
develop
what
all
they
knew
and
what
happened
with
regard
to
the
matter.
it's
suggested
that
the
question
of
the
cost
of
money
was
not
an
important
consideration
in
this
contract.
the
government
thinks
it
was
primary
and
that
the
record
shows
that.
mr.
wenzell
was
a
skilled
person
in
this
field
and
was
selected
by
budget
for
his
knowledge
in
regard
to
the
cost
of
money.
that
was
the
entire
purpose
in
first
employment.
he
was
later
used
in
connection
with
the
costs
under
the
contract
to
a
considerable
extent,
and
in
addition
to
that,
as
an
expediter
to
try
to
get
a
contract
informed
what
the
government
could
make.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
were
not
but
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
the
nature
of
it
is
not
disputed
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned.
and
i
am
trying
to
--
i
will
confine
myself
to
the
findings
of
the
court
of
claims
which
are
not
disputed.
the
contract
involved
as
this
largest
factor,
the
cost
of
money.
it
was
to
involve
a
cost
for
the
plant
of
$120,000,000
about
a
$107,000,000
for
the
plan
itself
and
the
rest
were
additional
working
funds.
the
cost
of
money
alone,
the
service
charges
run
around
$6,000,000
a
year
out
of
something
like
$9,000,000
that
would
have
to
be
paid
for
the
energy
in
order
to
have
this
plan
and
get
the
benefits
of
it
for
the
atomic
energy
commission.
so,
it
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
it
that
the
cost
of
money
was
of
great
importance.
but
beyond
that,
an
examination
shows
that
in
considering
the
cost
of
money,
various
formulas
were
examined
by
wenzell
and
he
then
resorted
to
first
boston
to
get
their
help
and
advice
for
him
in
regard
to
the
matter.
now,
he
then
advised
hughes
about
the
cost
of
money.
and
then,
mr.
dixon,
the
head
of
the
sponsors,
one
of
the
heads
with
mr.
yates,
also
asked
early
that
mr.
wenzell,
as
a
personal
favor
to
him
asked
first
boston
in
regard
to
what
this
--
these
funds
would
cost,
what
they
could
be
obtain
for
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
first
time
was
on
january
20th,
when
mr.
wenzell,
without
consulting
mr.
hughes
or
mr.
dodge,
took
paul
miller
from
first
boston
who
had
worked
on
ovec,
the
big
similar
project
at
portsmouth,
ohio
in
earlier
time.
he
took
mr.
miller
who
had
familiarity
with
first
boston
in
their
sales
department
to
a
meeting
of
the
budget
where
they
were
going
to
discuss
the
cost
of
money
and
the
possibility
of
this
project
without
consulting
budget
people
at
all.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
was
--
this
was
on
his
own.
that
was
january
20th.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
later,
i
think
it
was
in
february,
he
took
mr.
powell
robinson
to
a
similar
meeting.
mr.
robinson
was
the
vice
president
of
first
boston.
he
didn't
consult
his
superiors
in
budget
at
all
about
that.
he
took
him
to
the
meeting
on
his
own.
then
they
examined
the
various
cost
--
cost
of
money
and
they
took
it
in
different
ways.
they
--
this
was
to
be
as
finally
developed
a
very
thin
corporation.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
the
sponsors
were
to
contribute
--
i
think
that's
the
name
of
the
trade,
at
least
i
--
were
to
contribute
$5,500,000
out
of
the
total
capitalization
involving
the
debt
of
$120,000,000.
and
so
in
the
trade,
it's
called
"thin"
because
the
equity
capital
is
a
very
small
part
of
the
total
contribution.
now,
i
don't
mean
that
that's
bad
in
itself
but
that
makes
the
--
the
cost
of
money
a
considerable
problem.
so
they
examined
the
possibility
--
the
various
possibilities,
the
cost
of
money
based
upon
whether
there
was
a
95
percent
which
this
approximately
what
the
amount
of
other
capital
and
only
5
percent
of
equity
capital
contributed
by
the
sponsors
or
75
percent
and
25
percent
contributed
by
the
sponsors
or
50
percent
contributed
by
the
sponsors
and
50
percent
by
borrowing.
well,
you
can
readily
see
that
the
security
for
the
lenders
other
than
the
equity
contributors
increases
as
the
contribution
of
the
equity
is
made
through
the
transaction
and
therefore,
it
affects
the
interest
rate
and
the
amount
that
has
to
paid
in
order
to
pass
such
a
plan
by
the
capital
for
it
and
make
it
possible
to
have
the
electric
energy.
now,
they
found
that
it
would
cost
3.5
percent,
the
estimate
was
at
95
percent
and
3.5
percent
at
75
percent
but
3.25
percent
at
50
percent
contribution
of
equity
and
they
examined
that
carefully.
then
hughes
said,
"well,
that
runs
into
considerable
money,
is
there
anyway
by
making
it
a
longer
term
loan,
which
also
has
an
effect
on
the
cost
of
money
and
make
it
a
40-year?
let's
try
that
out."
and
so,
they
took
these
various
formulas
of
trying
to
determine
what
the
cost
of
money
would
be.
and
they
examined
that.
wenzell
didn't
examine
the
loan.
he
took
it
back
to
first
boston.
he
consulted
them
and
got
their
advice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
what
he
was
doing
was
going
back
and
asking
them
in
order
to
substantiate
his
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
is
--
no,
first
boston
including
other
people
in
first
boston.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
so.
i
--
i
think
at
that
time,
wenzell
had
an
idea
of
what
his
figures
were
and
what
he
thought
might
be
done
and
then
he
goes
back
to
his
organization
and
if
that's
as
much
as
it
happened,
we
wouldn't
claim
that
there
was
any
conflict
because
it
wouldn't
get
dixon-yates
people
on
the
other
side
of
the
picture.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
so
he
took
it
back
to
them
to
get
their
appraisal
of
the
cost
of
money
to
support
his
opinion
and
judgment
as
he
was
advising
the
bureau
of
the
budget.
then
he
proceeded
to
give
the
same
information
to
the
dixon-yates
people
in
regard
to
the
cost
of
money.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
and
they,
not
being
satisfied
entirely
with
mr.
wenzell's
advice,
wanted
to
know
more
specifically,
so
mr.
dixon
insisted
or
asked
for
a
meeting
with
a
mr.
linsley
who
was
chairman
of
the
finance
committee
of
first
boston
and
another
man,
mr.
miller
and
several
others.
and
he
wanted,
as
he
said
the
opinion
of
mr.
linsley
because
he
wanted
that
kind
of
judgment
about
what
the
market
was
going
to
be
concerning
this
financing.
he
was
not
going
to
take
just
the
appraisal
of
mr.
wenzell
but
he
considered
mr.
linsley,
a
person
of
great
skill
and
ability
and
of
course,
mr.
linsley
had
had
much
to
do,
the
record
shows,
with
the
ovec
matter
which
is
the
comparable
earlier
private
financing
deal.
so,
he
specifically,
mr.
dixon,
asked
for
that
conference
with
mr.
linsley
personally
so
he
could
discuss
market
conditions
and
the
appraisal
of
what
the
money
market
was
and
what
the
price
might
be.
i
present
that
to
show
how
important
it
was
considered
and
it's
obvious
that
on
a
transaction
of
this
size
that
if
the
money
arrangements
couldn't
be
made
carefully
and
safely,
nobody
would
dare
go
into
a
project
of
$120,000,000.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
in
february
as
when
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
we
get
to
the
meeting
with
mr.
linsley.
then
the
--
along
in
--
about
the
third
week
in
february,
mr.
james,
in
talking
with
mr.
dixon,
raised
the
question
of
mr.
wenzell
working
both
sides
of
the
street.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
james,
who
was
the
--
one
of
the
counsel
with
mr.
cahill's
firm
for
mr.
dixon's
middle
south
utilities
that
was
one
of
the
sponsors
in
this
matter.
and
he
said
to
mr.
dixon,
"what
about
this?
what
about
wenzell
working
for
you
and
telling
you
about
these
things,
cost
of
money
and
so
forth
and
working
about
budget?"
now,
he
didn't
say
that
that'll
be
a
conflict
of
interest
under
the
statute.
but
he
said
that
working
for
both
parties,
it
may
raise
in
very
serious
problems
at
least
in
regard
to
public
relations
because
of
all
the
heat
that's
on
this
matter
because
of
the
private
utility
question
as
against
public
utility.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
he
said
that
to
mr.
dixon,
his
client.
and
mr.
dixon
then
said
that
--
went
to
mr.
wenzell
and
raised
the
question
with
mr.
wenzell
and
said,
"aren't
you
disturbed
about
the
fact
you're
working
for
both
sides
in
this
matter
in
regard
to
this
contract?"
now,
it
was
all
in
a
proposal
stage
at
this
time
but
later
it
became
--
i'll
demonstrated
to
you
that
the
proposal
was
the
basis
for
the
contract
and
the
court
so
held.
there
were
two
proposals,
one
in
february
25th
and
one
of
april
10th.
the
one
that
became
the
basis
for
the
contract
and
the
court
of
claims
so
held
was
the
april
10th
one.
and
i'll
try
to
show
you,
trace
for
you
the
participation
by
mr.
wenzell
right
on
through
into
the
april
10th
which
became
the
heart
of
the
contract
in
controversy.
when
he
raised
the
question
with
mr.
wenzell,
he
suggested
that
he
take
it
up
with
mr.
hughes
of
the
budget.
and
mr.
hughes
--
he
then
raised
with
mr.
hughes
and
said,
"what
about
the
fact
that
i
have
prepared
this
letter?
and
i've
advised
you
and
i
have
also
told
first
or
dixon
all
the
time
about
the
cost
of
money.
and
i've
also
prepared
a
letter
which
was
not
delivered
but
which
was
a
letter
of
confirmation
of
the
cost
of
money,"
and
it
goes
into
great
detail,
a
considerable
detail
about
the
amount
that
would
be
involved
with
terms
of
the
financing
and
what
it
would
cost
according
to
their
appraisal
and
that
they
--
and
it
was
on
first
boston
stationary.
and
then
i'll
trace
that
letter
later
and
the
one
that
was
finally
given
that
was
signed.
but
this
was
the
draft
of
the
letter
that
was
made
by
wenzell.
i
think
it
was
long
in
february
in
--
when
he
was
discussing
the
cost
of
money
with
dixon.
and
he
said,
"well,
what
if
first
boston
later
becomes
involve
in
the
financing?"
and
hughes
said
that
he
thought
he
was
exaggerating
the
problem
but
that
--
and
that
was
a
long
time
off
and
that
he
--
if
he
was
bothered
by
he
ought
to
consult
his
lawyer
and
he
ought
to
tell
mr.
dodge.
so
he
went
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
he
did
say,
your
honor,
if
he
was
disturbed
about
it,
he
ought
to
consult
his
lawyer
and
he
ought
to
tell
mr.
dodge.
now,
mr.
wenzell
did
proceed
to
tell
mr.
dodge.
and
that
--
also
said
in
that
conversation
that
first
boston
might,
at
some
later
date,
become
involved
in
that
financing
of
this
contract
and
if
it
did,
would
that
be
any
--
would
that
bar
them
the
fact
that
he
was
working
for
both
of
them.
and
dodge
said
that
he
thought
he
should
consult
his
lawyer
in
regard
to
it.
and
he
didn't
seem
to
think
it
would
bar
them
because
that
was
a
long
time
off
and
he
also
said
to
him,
"if
you,
at
some
--
first
boston,
at
some
later
date,
does
become
involved
in
the
financing,
we,
in
the
budget,
should
be
informed
so
we
could
see
what
kind
of
advertisings
made
in
regard
to
it
and
--
and
you
feel
that's
involved."
now,
it
later
develops
that
mr.
wenzell
never
tells
budget
until
they
discovered
through
the
hearings
and
all
that
first
boston
had
actually
been
employed
with
the
financing.
they
were
--
they
never
gave
him
the
record.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
wenzell
did
not
do
as
requested
by
(inaudible)
through
the
bureau
of
the
budget
that
first
boston
was
going
to
be
involved
in
the
financing
and
give
the
budget
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
advertising
for
any
fee.
now,
this
was
all
dealing
with
the
first
proposal.
the
first
proposal
was
dated
as
of
february
25th.
and
in
that
proposal,
there
was
a
definition
of
what
the
sponsors
were
willing
to
do
in
regarding
--
regard
to
try
to
make
this
contract.
and
after
it
was
received,
mr.
wenzell
participated
in
advising
the
--
the
budget
in
regard
to
the
cost
of
money.
he
also
advised
dixon-yates.
and
upon
receipt
of
it,
he
proceeded
then
to
advise
in
regard
to
the
cost,
not
merely
the
cost
of
money
but
the
overall
cost
of
the
contract
or
the
proposal.
and
he
referred
to
the
tva
cost
and
studies
the
information
that
was
available
in
regard
to
tva
cost.
and
it
was
concluded
that
the
proposal
of
the
latter
part
of
february
could
not
be
accepted
by
the
government
because
it
was
too
high.
it
was
run
about
$200
a
kilowatt.
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
proposal
was
made
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
the
proposal
was
made
to
the
budget.
and
at
that
--
at
that
point
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
think
it
was
--
as
a
government
of
the
matter,
it
--
it
was
given
to
the
--
the
budget
but
i
think
no
question
what
he
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government
at
the
time.
and
in
this
proposal,
they
felt
that
the
energy
charged
and
the
charge
for
standby
or
plant
cost
were
out
of
line
compared
with
the
--
with
what
tva
could
do
under
its
fulton
plant
proposal
and
therefore,
it
could
not
be
accepted
by
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
after
that,
there
was
a
considerable
period
when
it
was
being
studied
by
budget
and
by
aec
and
mr.
wenzell,
shortly
after
that,
said
that
he
was
not
qualified
in
regard
to
overall
cost
and
the
government
should
get
someone
else.
and
they
did
get
mr.
adams
from
the
federal
power
commission
to
give
further
advice
in
regard
to
overall
cost.
but
in
regard
to
the
--
that
first
proposal,
mr.
wenzell
did
advise
the
bureau
of
the
budget
on
the
cost.
and
then
that
proposal
was
rejected
on
march
24th
of
the
same
year,
1954.
now,
the
government
contends
that
the
second
proposal
that
was
made
as
of
april
10th,
the
estimates
were
discussed
for
the
second
proposal
as
of
april
3rd
was
so
related
and
so
much
a
part
of
the
first
proposal
on
all
that
went
into
that,
that
you
can't
separate
the
two
and
say
that
wenzell
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
second
proposal
and
merely
with
the
first,
as
this
suggested
by
the
respondent.
and
the
reason
for
this
--
there
are
a
number
of
reasons.
one
of
them,
if
you'll
keep
in
mind
the
date
of
march
24th
that
the
government
told
dixon-yates
that
their
proposal
--
the
first
proposal
of
february
was
unacceptable.
they
come
--
came
forth
in
a
meeting
with
wenzell
in
the
budget
and
others
at
the
government
in
--
on
april
3rd
with
new
estimates.
that's
only
nine
days
to
try
to
bring
forth
an
entirely
new
proposal
with
a
new
approach
to
this
problem.
now,
the
only
real
new
approach
was
--
i
don't
mean
that
it
wasn't
substantial
but
it
was
--
that
they
were
trying
to
reduce
this
overall
cost
charge
in
regard
to
the
energy.
but
it's
the
government's
position
that
you
couldn't
possibly,
within
nine
days,
develop
anything
like
that
without
relying
upon
all
that
had
gone
before
in
wenzell
and
these
people
working
together,
that
there
was
a
whole
--
all
of
the
problems
going
to
the
cost
of
the
equipment,
the
cost
of
the
money,
how
it
could
be
financed
and
so
forth,
which
they've
already
gotten
from
wenzell
and
which
he
continued
to
advice
them
about
up
--
through
april
3rd.
there
is
some
difficulty
in
the
record
about
when
wenzell's
employment
stopped
with
budget.
because
he
said
that
he
conceived
his
employment
stopped
on
april
10th.
he
actually
did
nothing
more
for
the
budget
beyond
april
3rd.
but
his
testimony
was
he
conceived
his
employment
ended
on
april
10th.
he
did
however,
right
after
that,
do
a
great
deal
of
work
on
the
financing
with
first
boston
and
also
with
dixon-yates
after
he
was
not
working
for
the
budget
but
the
position
of
the
government,
he
couldn't
just
take
out
of
his
mind
all
of
the
things
he'd
done
on
behalf
of
the
government
with
budget
and
all
of
his
work
that
he'd
done
on
both
sides
of
the
street
for
both
of
them
and
then
continue
working
on
the
same
financial
problems
in
april
and
may
of
the
same
year
without
it
relating
to
what
was
done
before.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
first
boston.
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
he
was
--
i
cannot
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
in
that
form
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
now,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
i'm
--
he
orally
left
and
quit,
i
--
i
think
it's
the
best
description
of
it.
i
might
say
that
after
this
matter
came
up
and
hughes
suggested
that
he
consult
with
a
lawyer
or
counsel
with
regard
to
his
problem
about
the
conflict.
he
did
then
go
to
his
superior,
mr.
coggeshall
of
first
boston
and
asked
him
and
he
arranged
for
him
to
see
sullivan
and
cromwell.
he
saw
mr.
raben
and
sullivan
and
cromwell.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
raben
because
arthur
dean,
the
senior
partner
was
not
then
available
in
new
york
and
he
told
him
about
what
he'd
done.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
this
is
on
february.
and
that
he
had
drafted
this
form
of
confirmation
of
advice
on
the
first
boston
stationary
about
the
money
rate
and
what
could
be
obtained
for
and
that
he'd
been
working
for
budget
and
doesn't
tell
the
detail
of
what
he
probably
described
his
duties
and
that
he'd
been
working
with
dixon-yates.
and
raben
told
him
several
things.
he
said
first
that
he
should
resign
immediately
and
he
should
do
it
in
writing.
this,
he
never
did.
he
never
did
it
in
writing
and
he
didn't
do
it
immediately.
he
postponed
it
until
after
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
don't
recall
that
he
did.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
--i
think
i
better
check
that
before
i
answer
that
question
(inaudible).
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it's
clear
in
the
record
that
they
were
the
counsel
for
first
boston.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
president
of
first
boston
made
the
arrangements
for
the
conference.
he
was
--
he
was
the
vice
president
of
first
boston
during
all
this
period
and
the
director.
and
then
mr.
raben
checked
his
advice.
well,
raben
further
said
that
if
the
financing
was
offered
to
first
boston,
the
board
of
directors
should
consider
whether
they
should
accept
it
at
all
and
if
they
did,
whether
they
should
accept
any
fee.
this
advice
was
communicated
by
telephone
to
arthur
dean
in
washington,
the
senior
partner.
and
he
confirmed
the
advice
but
suggested
that
maybe
if
first
boston
was
selected,
it
would
want
to
do
it
as
a
public
utility
rather
than
accept
any
fee
for
it,
but
he
confirmed
the
advice
generally.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
was
oral.
there
is
no
contest
as
--
in
the
record
about
it
and
the
findings
are
clear
in
regard
to
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now,
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
they
told
him
that
it
was
a
violation
of
statute
because
it
didn't,
so
far
as
the
record
shows
anything
that
i
know,
it
didn't
show
that
that
was
what
he
said
but
it
was
clear
that
the
description
according
to
both
parties
was
given
by
mr.
wenzell
and
that
was
his
response
to
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
now,
if
you
would
turn
to
page
121
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
government's
petition,
you'll
find
in
that
appendix
the
various
findings
are
set
out.
and
at
the
bottom
of
page
120
is
finding
67,
which
sets
forth
the
opinion
letter
that
was
drafted
by
mr.
wenzell,
shown
to
both
dixon
and
hughes.
this
letter
was
not
signed
but
it
was
back
february
23rd.
and
when
he
discussed
this
letter
with
raben,
raben
said,
"well,
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
letter
was
signed
or
not."
he
merely
confirmed
the
oral
advice
that
he'd
been
giving
all
the
time.
but
this
letter
does
show
in
great
detail
that
it
is
the
kind
of
a
letter
that
is
given
of
opinion
in
regard
to
such
matters.
and
wenzell
in
his
discussion
with
dodge
said
that
it
might
be
construed
as
a
moral
commitment
in
regard
to
the
opinion
that
he'd
already
gave
that
would
bind
first
boston.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
we
--
we
do
not
challenge
the
findings
at
all.
there
is
an
agreement
that
either
party
can
call
upon
other
parts
of
the
record
but
we're
not
challenging
your
findings.
now,
turning
to
page
147
of
the
same
document
under
109
finding,
you
will
find
a
letter
that
was
signed
by
first
boston
in
connection
with
the
second
proposal.
and
for
all
practical
purposes,
it's
--
it's
substantially
the
same.
there
is
a
small
change
in
regard
to
the
amount
of
the
total
amount
from
$130,000,000
to
$120,000,000.
and
there
--
there's
a
slight
change
in
regard
to
the
30
years.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
page
147.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
finding
109
and
you'll
notice
about
a
third
--
way
down
to
page
dated
april
14th.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
a
detailed
letter
substantially
showing
the
thread
of
wenzell's
advice
all
the
way
through.
and
the
record
is
that
mr.
james,
the
attorney
for
mr.
dixon,
used
mr.
wenzell's
first
draft
67
--
finding
67
that
was
not
ever
signed
as
the
model
for
the
one
that
was
signed.
and
it
shows
how
closely
it
was
related
all
the
way
through
and
that
advice
relied
on.
now,
to
show
the
reliance
that
they
did
place
upon
this
kind
of
advice,
mr.
yates,
the
other
sponsor
in
this
matter
wrote
a
letter
the
first
part
of
march
of
1954
to
his
directors
saying
that
they
had
received
advice
from
first
boston
with
wenzell
that
this
financing
could
be
done
at
3.5
percent
in
accordance
with
the
$120,000,000
and
so
forth
that
they
we
are
talking
about.
so
he
was
reassuring
his
directors
that
this
moneys
--
advice
in
regard
to
the
cost
of
money
could
be
relied
upon,
was
relied
upon
and
that
first
boston
had
given
it
to
them
so
they
could
and
they
could
assume
that
under
the
market
was
a
fair
assumption
that
they
would
be
able
to
market
these
bonds
and
wouldn't
have
trouble
with
the
financing.
and
that's
a
part
of
the
record
with
regard
to
the
matter.
now,
on
page
122
of
that
same
volume,
there
is
indented
in
the
upper
half
of
the
page,
the
wording
of
the
proposal
and
the
identical
language
is
used
in
the
april
10th
proposal.
we
have
received
assurances
from
responsible
financial
specialist,
expressing
the
belief
that
financial
arrangements
can
be
consummated
on
the
basis
which
we
have
used
in
making
this
proposal
and
under
existing
market
conditions
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
and
our
offer
is
conditioned
upon
such
consummation.
now,
we
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
that
was
in
both
proposals,
to
show
the
reliance
that
was
placed
upon
it
and
the
fact
that
it
was
so
important
to
this
deal
that
the
whole
thing
was
conditioned
upon
whether
or
not
that
would
work
out
in
accordance
with
the
advice
that
mr.
wenzell
had
given.
now
later
on,
as
i
presume
you
all
know
that
the
contract
was
terminated.
it
was
terminated
in
the
first
--
not
for
the
conflict,
it
was
terminated
because
memphis
came
forward
and
said
they
would
build
a
plant
and
that
would
take
care
of
the
--
the
entire
problem
that
wouldn't
need
the
capacity
of
this
proposal
in
order
to
satisfy
the
additional
requirements
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
then
the
--
after
the
april
10th
proposal
was
made,
it
was
--
a
study
was
made
for
sometime
and
then
a
man
by
the
name
of
von
tresckow
came
forth
with
another
proposal,
unsolicited.
and
that
was
then
examined
in
the
government
as
to
how
it
compared
with
the
proposal
of
the
sponsors
and
it
accounted
for
some
considerable
delay
in
trying
to
analyze
that
by
all
of
various
interested
parties
that
the
government
got
together
to
try
to
determine.
and
i
--
and
then
july
7th,
they
started
the
negotiations
on
the
contract
itself.
and
the
--
the
court
of
claims
held
as
a
specific
plan
that
the
contract
substantially
conformed
to
the
april
10th
proposal,
so
that
in
substance,
it
was
the
same
as
the
contract.
now,
there
were
changes
in
the
contract.
there
are
modifications
and
changes
but
in
substance,
the
court
of
claims
found
that
it
conformed
to
the
april
10th
proposal.
the
government
is
not
contending
that
it
was
overreached
of
any
fraud
in
connection
with
the
contract
at
--
after
the
termination
because
memphis
came
forward
offering
to
build
the
plant.
the
government
sat
down
to
try
to
find
out
the
termination
cost,
what
it
would
pay.
and
in
those
discussions,
it
reserved
the
right
of
whether
or
not
the
conflict
of
interest
would
be
taken
advantage
of
--
by
the
government
as
grounds
for
disaffirmance.
but
they
did
proceed
to
discuss
what
the
termination
cost
would
be
under
the
terms
of
the
contract
itself
if
they
didn't
disaffirm,
reserving
that
right.
in
the
mean
time,
it
was
studied
in
the
government.
there
were
many
hearings
before
the
senate
committee
and
there
is
a
--
a
hearing
before
the
sec
in
regard
to
the
sum
of
the
financing
earlier
that
referred
to
in
the
brief.
and
then
on
advice
of
counsel,
the
atomic
energy
commission
did
disaffirm
the
contract
and
say
that
because
of
the
conflict
of
interest
of
mr.
wenzell,
working
for
first
boston
and
the
budget
at
the
same
time,
the
contract
was
disaffirmed
and
unenforceable
against
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
well
over
$2,000,000.
and
then
there
is
no
controversy
about
those
various
amounts.
the
various
--
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
termination
that
they
talked
about
is
the
same
as
we
proved
here
finally
and
the
court
of
claims
allow.
if
they
are
entitled
to
recover
under
the
law,
the
government
doesn't
contest
the
amounts
that
are
set
forth
in
the
findings.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
april
--
april
10th
proposal
was
given.
you
see
the
second
proposal.
there
were
negotiations
by
the
first
proposal
ripening
into
a
proposal
of
february
25th
then
there
was
--
that
was
unacceptable
and
the
government
so
advised
them
march
24th.
and
on
april
10th,
there
was
another
proposal
and
that
was
the
one
that
became
substantially
the
contract
according
to
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
proposal
was
tendered
as
of
april
10th.
now,
it
was
not
accepted
as
a
basis
of
--
of
contracting
until
later
by
the
government.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
--
the
negotiations
were
started
july
7th.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
the
evidence
is
just
the
discussions
that
i
have
related
about
the
possibility
but
the
agreement
as
to
actual
financing
was
clearly
made
as
of
may
7th
when
they
started
working
on
a
plan.
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
dixon
was
that
he
thought
he
had
directed
first
boston
to
proceed
with
the
financing
as
of
april
12,
but
there
is
apparently
a
misunderstanding
and
mr.
miller
was
out-of-town.
they
try
to
call
april
22nd
and
someone
else
they
try
to
reach
so
that
mr.
dixon
was
quite
unhappy
because
they
didn't
have
something
ready
for
him
in
may
--
early
may
and
they
got
down
to
it.
now,
the
fact
is
later
that
they
brought
lehman
brothers
in
for
half
of
the
financing.
and
that
proposal
was
made
by
dixon.
it's
unexplained
as
to
why,
whether
it's
to
try
to
get
rid
of
the
conflict
problem
or
what.
there's
no
showing
in
the
record
that
lehman
brothers
had
ever
done
any
prior
financing
for
dixon
or
yates.
but
they
are
brought
in
to
it.
and
at
that
conversation
between
mr.
dixon
and
--
and
mr.
woods,
chairman
of
the
board
of
first
boston,
in
regard
to
bring
lehman
brothers
in.
mr.
woods
is
very
unhappy
about
it
according
to
the
record
and
talk
to
as
though
he
was
willing
to
back
out.
and
then
he
finally
said
that
if
they
could
have
60
percent
of
any
fee
and
control
of
the
handling
of
the
financing,
they
would
go
ahead
with
lehman
brothers
in
it.
and
later,
long
time
later
in
--
in
1955,
after
all
the
controversy
in
regard
to
the
hearings
and
--
and
charges
in
the
senate
and
so
forth,
the
first
boston
made
a
public
statement
that
they
were
not
charging
a
fee.
and
the
record
is
that
lehman
brothers
were
unhappy
with
that.
they
thought
that
--
that
there
should
be
at
least
a
nominal
fee
and
then
it
was
done
as
a
public
service.
the
government
doesn't
think
if
there's
a
question
of
fee
or
not
fee
is
important
to
the
matter
in
the
first
place.
when
first
boston
did
the
ovec
job,
they
got
$150,000
and
$20,000
for
expenses,
a
comparable
situation.
and
it
was
throughout
the
period
that
wenzell
was
working
for
both
sides.
he
had
every
reason
to
think
that
they
would
get
a
fee.
now,
his
compensation
was
based
upon
a
salary
with
first
boston
and
a
bonus
on
the
business
that
he
was
able
to
bring
to
it.
so
the
government's
position
is
--
is
the
effect
on
wenzell's
acting
in
good
faith
and
completely
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
to
this
involve.
and
he
had
every
reason
to
think
he
could
get
this
business
in
there
at
that
time
that
he
would
get
something
comparable
to
the
ovec
fee.
now
in
addition
to
that,
the
record
is
very
clear
that
both
lehman
brothers
and
first
boston
thought
this
was
a
very
valuable
financing
to
have
as
far
as
reputation
in
the
business
was
concern
and
that
they
didn't
even
charge
a
fee
in
it
that
it
would
help
them
get
other
business
that
would
be
very
attractive.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
statute
which
is
on
page
2
of
the
government's
brief
and
call
your
attention
to
the
language
of
it
and
some
of
the
arguments
that
are
made
and
what
we
think
the
answers
to
it
are
--
to
them
are.
"whoever,
being
an
officer,
agent
or
member
of,"
and
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear,
we
don't
claim
he's
an
officer,
agent
or
member
of
dixon-yates
companies
or
the
mississippi
valley
generating
company,
we
claim
that
he
was
officer,
director
and
his
wife
was
a
stockholder
of
first
boston,
"or
directly
or
indirectly
interested,"
and
we
say
that
he
was
at
least
indirectly,
"interested
in
the
pecuniary
profits
or
contracts,"
of
first
boston,
"of
any
corporation".
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
"of
any
corporation,"
we
say
that's
first
boston,
"is
employed
or
acts
as
an
officer
or
agent
of
the
united
states
for
the
transaction
of
business
with
such
business
entity
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
first
boston.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$2,000
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
two
years
or
both."
now,
he
also
is
acting
clearly
here,
was
acting
for
dixon-yates
but
the
benefit
he
was
expecting
to
get,
according
to
the
contention
of
the
government,
was
from
the
contract,
the
subcontract
or
the
financing
contract
of
first
boston.
we
don't
claim
that
he
had
any
direct
financial
interest
in
the
mississippi
generating
contract.
we
say
that
as
a
subcontractor,
he
was
expecting
it
all
--
all
the
time
and
had
a
--
a
reasonable
substantial
expectancy,
which
is
the
general
words
of
the
court
of
claims,
that
first
boston
was
going
to
get
this
business
when
he
was
working
for
both
of
them
and
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
--
he
was
helping
the
government,
he
was
helping
dixon-yates
so
first
boston
will
get
the
benefit.
now,
it
provides
a
fine
or
imprisonment
or
both.
and
the
--
an
argument
is
made
that
it
doesn't
say
that
the
contract
is
unenforceable.
the
position
of
the
government
is
that
this
is
a
declaration
of
the
public
policy
by
the
congress
that
you
just
can't
--
can't
be
in
that
kind
of
a
position
where
you're
working
for
both
sides
when
you're
working
for
the
government.
and
therefore,
that
being
a
declaration
of
public
policy,
the
courts
will
not
give
judicial
sanction
to
such
a
contract.
now,
there
is
one
question
raised
about
the
fact
that
the
statute
18-216,
a
bribery
statute,
has
a
provision
that
the
contract
maybe
declared
unenforceable
by
the
president.
and
they
say
that
in
the
--
the
legislative
history
is
against
our
construction
of
this
--
making
this
contract
unenforceable
under
this
statute
because
it
doesn't
have
that
like
provision
when
the
statute
were
considered
much
the
same
time
back
in
1862.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
in
that
regard
is
that
when
senator
fessenden
discussed
that
addition
and
the
issue
then
before
the
congress
was
whether
or
not
it
should
be
unenforceable
or
void.
he
said,
"all
i
am
doing
is
trying
to
have
--
incorporating
the
statute
of
principal
of
general
law,"
so
it's
the
position
the
government
--
it
really
didn't
add
anything
or
subtract
anything
and
that's
what
the
legislative
history
is.fessenden
then
said,
"this
is
just
the
principle
of
general
law
that
i
am
asking
to
be
incorporated
in
this
statute."
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
of
the
court
of
claims
and
this
court
that
--
to
the
effect
that
you
will
not
enforce
that
type
of
contract
of
--
under
this
type
of
statute.
now,
there
is
one
case
that
was
discussed
by
the
court
of
claims
in
the
majority
and
the
minority
opinion
that
i'd
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
and
that's
the
muschany
case.
in
that
case,
as
you
will
recall,
there
was
a
contract
for
options.certain
options
for
land
were
secured
and
there
was
provision
for
a
commission
to
the
option
agent.
and
the
majority
of
the
court,
the
--
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
this
was
a
commissioned
contract
or
a
commission
based
upon
cause
or
a
contract
or
a
cost-plus-fixed-fee.
the
majority
of
the
court
held
that
the
contract
was
in
fact
a
cost-plus-fixed-fee,
which
was
express
--
expressly
exempted
from
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute
that
prohibited
any
contract
for
cost
plus
the
commission.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
your
case
is
often
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
often
say
that
they
are
unenforceable
and
some
of
them
say
it's
void
and
unenforceable
and
so
that
--
at
least,
it's
unenforceable.
and
at
the
very
least
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
the
government
--
all
of
the
cases,
federal
cases
seem
to
make
it
clear
that
it's
unenforceable
giving
the
election
to
the
government,
then
there
is
also
the
cases
in
regard
to
have
been
void
as
against
the
public
policy.
and
i
think
--
i
--
i
don't
think
the
refinement
of
whether
it
would
be
void
or
unenforceable
has
been
made
by
this
court
in
such
a
situation.
we
are
taking
the
position
in
this
case
that
it's
either
void
or
unenforceable
because
of
our
disaffirmance,
that
at
least
it's
unenforceable
because
of
disaffirmance.
and
that
we
think
that
the
contracts
of
that
type
--
probably
the
best
protection
for
the
government
would
be
that
there'd
be
innovation
or
new
contract
that
cleaned
out
whatever
the
conflict
was
involved.
this
is
of
great
importance
to
the
government.
i
tried
to
find
out
the
extent
of
the
contract
and
the
problem
with
the
government
in
order
to
be
able
to
give
you
some
light
in
regard
to
it.
and
i
had
difficulty
getting
anything
i
could
cite
to
you
that
was
public
records
that
--
in
hearings
or
something
of
that
kind.
there
are
publications
that
have
been
made
by
the
defense
department,
gsa
and
others,
and
i
found
that
there
are
over
six
million
contracts
a
year
in
the
defense
department
alone
involving
procurement
and
there
are
over
--
involving
over
$2,500
in
amount.
and
there
--
that
involve
some
$21
billion
in
amount.
and
then
in
gsa,
there
is
almost
a
billion
dollars
a
year
in
contracting,
and
then
all
of
the
other
departments
and
agencies
have
a
problem.
i
only
call
your
attention
to
that
to
emphasize
what
we
think
the
importance
of
the
rule
that
congress
has
laid
down
here,
the
principle,
in
that
if
the
government
is
to
be
protected
in
this
area
and
the
courts
would
lay
down
a
rule
that
you
had
to
examine
in
every
case
whether
or
not
there
was
a
waiver
by
some
official
in
the
government
or
whether
or
not
there
was
some
inequity
in
the
transaction,
it
would
be
an
--
an
endless
problem
and
would
--
and
would
be
no
protection
for
the
country
whatsoever.
now,
there
is
--
may
i
finish
just
in
that
regard?
there
is
no
question
about
what
--
on
a
quantum
meruit
or
quantum
valebat.
there
could
be
a
recovery
if
there's
any
benefit
from
the
government
that's
recognized
here.
there
wasn't
any
benefit
from
the
government
and
so
it
couldn't
be
that.
but
if
you
didn't
have
this
kind
of
a
rule,
you
could
have
a
great
portion
of
the
contracts
in
which
the
--
you
would
find
that
it
might
be
a
considerable
advantage
to
take
a
chance
at
having
somebody
on
the
inside
that
could
help
you
get
the
contract
or
help
you
make
it
to
advantage
and
you
couldn't
lose
too
much
because
you
could
always
get
the
quantum
meruit
or
the
quantum
valebat
and
then
you
could
take
a
chance
on
whether
you
could
get
a
richer
profit
if
you
had
it
in
the
contract.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
we
--
we
don't
think
that
you
have
to
find
the
criminal
intent
because
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
this
court
has
said
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute
and
that
criminal
statutes
generally
are
strictly
construed.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it's
your
duty
to
--
try
to
carry
out
the
policy
that
the
congress
has
laid
down
and
it
has
coupled
those
two
things
together.
so
i
don't
think
it's
quite
the
same
as
the
ordinary
criminal
statute
rule
in
that
you're
also
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
more
in
light
of
--
of
this
language
that
the
court
has
used
in
regard
to
the
enforceability
of
the
contract
so
far
as
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
only
in
being
sure
that
you
carried
out
the
policy
of
the
congress,
the
public
policy.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
i
think
you
try
to
do
that
there,
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
do
not
say
that.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
didn't
mean
to
characterize
anybody
in
this
argument.
i
didn't
think
i
did.
i
do
think
that
several
things
need
recomment,
one,
in
regard
to
the
regulations
of
the
department
of
justice
and
other
departments
that
are
referred
to.
those
regulations
go
much
beyond
the
statute.
in
that
if
there
is
any
kind
of
conflict
problem
that
doesn't
involve
contracting
at
all,
the
employee
or
agent
or
officer
is
instructed
to
go
to
his
superior.
there's
no
effort,
no
indication
of
any
kind
that
the
government
in
any
part
of
it
is
not
recognizing
the
validity
of
this
statute
and
living
up
to
it
and
believing
into
--
in
it.
that
--
those
regulations
go
much
beyond
that
as
far
as
keeping
the
government
clean
in
all
of
this
area.
now,
in
regard
to
knowing
about
this
contract,
counsel
called
attention
to
your
--
to
finding
126
and
read
you
just
one
paragraph.
if
--
if
you
read
the
next
paragraph,
the
last
paragraph
in
finding
126
on
page
156,
you'd
see
that
the
finding
is,
in
december,
1954,
the
aec
had
a
representative
present
at
the
sec
equity
hearings
where
it
was
stated
that
first
boston
had
been
retained
as
financial
agent
for
mvg.
however,
there
is
no
evidence
that
any
representative
of
aec
had
knowledge
up
to
that
time
that
wenzell,
while
serving
as
a
consultant
to
the
budget
bureau,
had
been
meeting
with
and
supplying
information.
now,
this
is
the
contracting
agency
to
the
sponsors
regarding
the
project
nor
that
any
aec
representatives
knew
the
extent
to
which
the
sponsors
were
aware
of
wenzell's
activities
in
that
regard.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
the
last
paragraph
of
126
finding
on
page
156
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
then
the
following
paragraph,
finding
127,
makes
it
clear
that
they
never
gave
any
notice
whatsoever
to
the
budget
bureau
that
first
boston
had
been
retained
as
financial
agent
by
the
sponsors
or
that
the
terms
and
the
conditions
upon
which
the
retainer
was
made.
now,
that's
an
undisputed
finding.
now,
if
you
go
to
page
153
in
regard
to
this
discussion
about
the
fee,
i
said
it
took
him
quite
a
long
time
to
decide
they
wouldn't
charge
a
fee
and
the
record
proofs
it.
in
the
middle
of
page
153
in
the
finding,
it
says
the
decision
not
to
charge
a
fee
was
based
on
woods'
conclusion
that
the
financing
which
first
boston
had
been
retained
to
handle
had
flowed
directly
from
the
conversation
which
woods
had
had
with
dodge
in
may
1953,
when
woods
had
offered
wenzell's
services
and
so
forth
and
that
first
boston
should
not
charge
a
fee
for
assistance
in
obtaining
funds
over
designed
to
obviate
the
necessity
of
federal
expenditures
--
expenditure
for
the
expansion
of
tva.
until
november
17th,
neither
lehman
brothers
nor
any
representative
of
the
sponsors
had
noticed
the
first
boston's
attitude.
then
it
goes
on
to
tell
about
a
discussion
back
and
forth
as
to
whether
it
was
proper
not
to
charge
a
fee
and
lehman
said
that
there
should
be
at
least
a
small
fee.
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
--
they
got
down
to
the
question
of
the
sec
hearings
on
what
they
were
going
to
testify
to
and
then
they
came
out
and
made
it
clear
that
there
would
be
no
fee
charge.
then
on
page
155
at
--
at
finding
123
(inaudible)
find
the
heart
of
it,
dixon
was
surprised
by
first
boston's
decision
not
to
accept
the
fee
for
its
services
of
financial
agent.
the
decision
was
unusual
and
without
presence
in
the
history
of
first
boston.
now,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
inherent
in
it,
i
was
trying
to
demonstrate
in
the
brief
here
and
in
our
argument
that
there
wasn't
any
question
with
what
wenzell
was
on
both
sides
and
that
the
advice
that
he
gave
that
this
financial
advice
was
certainly
important
enough
for
hughes
with
the
financial
man
himself
tells
he
needed
help
on
it.
and
he
looked
to
--
he
got
wenzell
for
the
very
perfect
adviser.
and
wenzell
was
advising
both
sides
on
that
very
important
question
in
that
contract.
and
then
i
say
that
it
was
inherent,
it
continued
throughout.
and
since
it's
--
it's
the
taint
in
the
contract
that
it
goes
right
squarely
against
the
statute
to
allow
the
enforceability.
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
government
contract,
it
should
not
be
enforced.
