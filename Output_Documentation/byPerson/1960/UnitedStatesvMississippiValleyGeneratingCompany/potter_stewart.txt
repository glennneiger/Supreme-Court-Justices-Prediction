stewart
to
whom
was
the
proposal
made,
mr.
solicitor
general?
to
the
budget
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
atomic
energy
commission
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
a
general
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
mr.
cahill.
you've
told
us
that
there
was
no
difference
of
the
opinion
as
to
the
fact
findings
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
government
hears
and
told
us
generally
that
they
don't
quarrel
at
all
that
the
findings
of
fact
did
not
sue
you,
is
that
also
true?
what's
your
position?
do
you
accept
the
findings
of
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
why
i'm
asking
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
there's
a
universal
acceptance
of
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
right,
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
who
was
known
by
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
government's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
known
by
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
was
it
known
by
this
congressional
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so
mr.
hughes
--
mr.
dodge
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cahill,
i'm
a
little
confused
perhaps
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
mr.
wenzell
concurred
that
the
--
the
original
offer
was
too
high.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
well,
now
--
of
course,
he
--
he
--
there's
no
allegation
that
he
was
interested
at
all
in
dixon-yates
as
such
but
rather
and
he
was
as
--
considerably
he
was
an
officer
and
an
employee
of
first
boston
and
would
it
necessarily
have
been
to
first
boston's
interest
to
have
a
high
price
pay
but
first
boston
was
interest
in,
was
that
there'd
be
such
a
contract
entered
into
so
that
they
could
perhaps
get
for
the
financing
business.
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
other
words,
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
my
question
was
--
was
only
prompted
by
this,
you
made
--
or
i've
seen
you
that
you're
making
something
of
a
point
of
the
fact
that
mr.
wenzell
concurred
in
the
view
that
the
original
offer
by
the
(inaudible)
was
too
high
and
my
question
was
prompted
by
the
thought
that
this
would
--
this
reaction
would
not
at
all
be
antithetical
to
his
position
in
first
boston.
first
boston
didn't
care,
i
suppose,
what
the
price
was
between
dixon-yates
and
the
government.
justice
potter
stewart
their
interest
was
that
a
contract
be
negotiated
so
that
they
can
get
part
of
the
financing
business
whatever
the
price
was.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
the
construction
cost
estimate.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
not
the
money
cost.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
cahill,
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
whittaker,
he
was
trying
to
get
at
your
theory
as
to
how
you
would
save
the
government
$100,000,000.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
--
it
was
the
fact
that
