mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
and
the
polaroid
case
which
follows
it,
arise
under
the
excess
profits
tax
act
of
1950,
that's
the
so
called
korean
war
excess
profits
tax.
the
taxpayer
is
a
corporation
engaged
in
the
development,
manufacture
and
sale
of
ethical
drugs.
during
the
years
1946
to
1949,
before
the
excess
profits
tax
years,
the
taxpayer
developed
two
new
chemical
compounds,
one
of
which
proved
to
be
effective
in
the
treatment
of
peptic
ulcers
and
was
sold
under
the
trade
name
of,
“banthine”.
the
other
was
proved
effective
in
the
prevention
and
treatment
of
motion
sickness
and
was
sold
under
the
name,
“dramamine”.
in
19
--
during
the
years
1950
to
1953,
which
are
the
excess
profits
tax
years,
the
taxpayer
realized
very
substantial
amounts
of
income
from
the
manufacture
and
sale
of
these
two
products.
it
included
that
income
in
the
computation
of
its
excess
profits
tax
for
those
years.
later,
however,
they
filed
claims
for
refund,
claiming
that
a
part
of
that
income
in
sale
of
those
two
products
was
entitled
to
relief
in
part
from
the
excess
profits
tax
under
section
456
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
at
the
outset,
i
like
to
explain
briefly
what
section
456
really
is.
section
456
is
one
of
a
wide
variety
of
provisions
ultimately
designed
to
provide
a
more
equitable
measure
of
the
income
that
should
be
subjected
to
the
special
war
time
rate
imposed
by
the
excess
profits
tax.
its
particular
profits
is
income
which
is
realized
during
the
excess
profits
tax
years,
but
in
fact
is
attributable
to
events
or
work
done
in
prior
years.
the
clearest
example
might
be
income
which
was
fully
earned
before
the
war,
but
was
subject
to
litigation
which
was
not
resolved
until
after
the
excess
profits
tax
was
enacted.
and
i
think
there
is
good
reason
not
to
subject
that
income
to
the
full
burden
of
the
excess
profits
tax,
simply
because
it
wasn't
really
realized
until
that
time.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
i
will
come
to
the
precise
definition.
i'm
--
at
this
point
i
was
just
suggesting
the
--
the
general
purpose
of
the
provision.
there
are
three
requirements
to
qualify
for
relief.
i'm
speaking
again
in
broad
terms.
the
first
is
you
must
have
an
eligible
kind
of
income,
income,
an
eligible
class
of
income,
income
which
is
of
a
kind
to
which
the
section
applied.
the
second
requirement
is
that
it
must
--
that
class,
the
eligible
class
of
income,
must
be
abnormal
in
amounts,
which
is
defined
to
mean
in
excess
of
115%
of
the
average
income
of
that
same
class
for
the
four
previous
years.
now,
at
this
point,
i
think
i
can
clarify
mr.
justice
whittaker's
problem.
the
statute
in
the
definition
of
abnormal
income
first
speaks
of
income
which
is
abnormal
in
kind,
income
that
is
not
normal
for
the
taxpayer
to
receive
and
then
speaks
of
income
which
is
normal
to
receive,
but
which
is
abnormal
in
amount.
now
practically,
it
is
only
the
abnormality
in
amount
that
is
important
because
any
income
that
is
not
normal
to
receive
will
also
be
abnormal
in
amount.
such
--
the
--
the
only
real
quantitative
--
the
only
test
that
the
abnormality
test
imposed
is
the
quantitative
test,
but
if
you
have
income
that
is
an
eligible
kind
and
which
meets
the
quantitative
test,
then
you
have
what
is
called
abnormal
income
and
the
excess
of
that
over
the
115%
average
for
the
four
or
five
years,
less
allocable
deductions
is
the
--
is
called
the
net
abnormal
--
the
net
abnormal
income.
now
you're
not
automatically
entitled
to
relief
for
the
net
abnormal
income.
the
third
step
is
that
you
must
show
that
that
income
or
part
of
it
is
in
fact
attributable
to
other
years.
now,
if
you
satisfy
all
three
of
those
tests,
eligibility
in
kind,
abnormality
in
amount
and
attributability
to
other
years,
then
the
relief
that
you
get
is
that
you
reallocate
the
net
abnormal
income
to
the
years
to
which
it
is
attributable.
now
the
significant
part
of
the
relief
is
the
income
that
you
reallocate
to
pre-excess
profit
tax
years
to
prewar
years,
because
any
income
that
you
cast
back
to
those
years,
escapes
the
excess
profits
tax
entirely.
now,
the
problem
here
isn't
all
that
complicated.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
concerned
only
with
the
threshold
question,
only
with
the
question
of
the
eligibility
of
the
income,
whether
the
income
derived
from
the
sale
of
these
patented
products,
dramamine
and
banthine,
which
i
omitted
to
say
were
patented,
is
income
of
the
kind,
which
is
eligible
to
qualify
under
the
section.
now
eligibility
is
controlled
by
paragraph
(1)
and
(2)
of
section
456
(a)
and
all
of
my
discussion
will
be
about
those
two
paragraphs
and
that
is
the
one
part
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no.
this
case
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
only
question
presented
in
this
court
at
this
time
is
the
question
of
eligibility.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
other
questions
will
still
be
in
the
case,
but
i
--
i
will
find
it
later.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
in
--
in
the
posture
we're
in,
in
this
court
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
if
we
prevailed
on
that,
we'd
have
to
go
back
for
trial
in
the
other
issues.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
the
only
question
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
governed
by
paragraphs
(1)
and
(2)
of
456
(a),
which
is
set
forth
at
pages
24
and
25
of
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
our
big
brief.
now,
paragraph
(1)
defines
abnormal
income
as
meaning
income
of
any
class
described
in
paragraph
(2).
that's
the
--
those
are
the
eligible
class
of
income,
income
of
any
class
described
in
paragraph
(2),
so
that
the
only
eligible
classes
of
income
are
those
described
in
paragraph
(2).
paragraph
(2),
then
lists
four
classes
of
income
which
are
specifically
described.
the
one
under
which
our
taxpayer
here
claims
to
qualify
is
subparagraph
(b),
which
includes
income
resulting
from
exploration,
discovery
or
prospecting.
and
his
argument
is
that
discovery
as
used
there
includes
invention
and
therefore,
its
income
derived
from
the
sale
of
its
invented
products,
banthine
and
dramamine,
is
income
resulting
from
discovery
i.e.
the
discovery
of
those
two
products.
now
i
should
add
that
there
is
an
alternative
argument
which
is
made
by
the
taxpayer
here
based
on
the
last
sentence
of
--
of
paragraph
(2).
that
argument
is
made
at
greater
length
by
polaroid
and
in
following
case
and
i
propose
to
deal
with
that
primarily
in
that
case
and
here,
i
would
like
to
concentrate
on
the
discovery
argument.
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
--
this
is
in
a
suit
for
refund
by
the
taxpayer.
the
total
claim
of
refund,
involve
about
4.5
million
dollars
in
tax.
only
three
of
the
four
years
were
actually
covered
by
the
suit.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
government
on
the
ground
that
discovery
as
used
in
subparagraph
(b),
does
not
include
inventions.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
discovery
was
not
used
in
the
particular
limited
sense
and
could
include
inventions
and
remanded
the
case
for
trial
to
decide
whether
dramamine
and
banthine
were
actually
discoveries
though.
now,
subsequently,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
the
polaroid
case
expressly
disagreed
with
the
seventh
circuit
and
first
circuit
held
the
discovery
was
limited
to
the
finding
of
mineral
deposits
and
did
not
include
inventions
and
it
was
to
resolve
that
conflict
that
the
cases
were
brought
here.
turning
to
the
interpretation
of
subparagraph
(b),
what
discovery
there
means,
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
concede
at
the
outset
that
inventions
are
in
common
usage
very
often
referred
to
as
discoveries.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
conforms
with
--
with
the
best
use
of
the
term.
i
think
the
dictionary
would
support
me
that
the
best
use
of
the
term
is
to
include
finding
things
that
previously
exists,
as
distinguished
from
creating
something
new.
i
don't
want
to
quibble
about
that,
how
(inaudible)
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
the
constitution
also
described
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
it
is
indeed.
i
think
webster's
in
fact,
does
distinguish
between
discovery
and
invention.
i
--
i'm
not
relying
on
that
distinction
in
any
event.
i
am
prepared
that
the
--
that
customarily,
very
commonly,
the
inventions
are
called
discoveries.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
so
is
virtually
everything
else
in
common
usage
and
if
you
gave
discovery
the
meaning
in
its
broadest
sense
as
--
as
used,
it
would
mean
that
virtually,
all
income
results
from
discovery.
for
example,
not
only
does
an
inventor
discover
a
new
product,
but
a
manufacturer
discovers
a
new
source
of
supply,
he
discovers
a
way
to
cut
cost,
he
discovers
a
new
market,
he
discovers
the
value
of
advertising.
in
short,
in
common
parlance,
discovery
really
includes
any
new
acquisition
of
knowledge
and
i
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
you
can't
read
it
in
this
statute
in
that
broad
sense.
now,
in
fact
taxpayers
here,
although
that
they
state
their
argument
as
the
common
ordinary
meaning
versus
a
strict
technical
meaning,
in
fact
they
recognize
that
you
--
the
word
has
to
be
limited
because
although
they
start
there,
they
end
up
trying
to
suggest
that
discovery
really
includes
only
basic
inventions
and
doesn't
include
minor
inventions,
which
certainly
is
not
in
accord
with
common
usage.
so
they
also
recognize
that,
we
have
to
give
the
term
here
some
--
some
limited
meaning
and
the
question
really
is
which
limited
meaning.
the
government's
position
is
that
discovery
as
used
here
in
this
statute
is
used
in
the
well-defined
and
special
sense
in
which
it
is
used
in
mining.
namely,
this
is
one
of
the
definitions
included
in
the
dictionary.
the
original
finding
of
a
part
of
the
vain
or
load,
it
has
a
fine
requisite
in
valid
location
of
a
mining
company.
so
it's
in
the
special
use
of
discovery
in
the
--
in
industry
that
we
contend
is
meaning
here.
now,
i
think
i
can
prove
--
i
hope
to
prove
simply
from
the
face
of
the
statutes,
in
the
face
of
section
456,
that
the
term
is
used
in
that
sense
and
does
not
include
inventions.
now
first,
our
point
to
the
subparagraph
(b),
which
says
income
from
exploration,
discovery
or
prospecting,
now,
those
three
words
are
all
words
which
have
a
special
meaning
in
mining.
it
is
mining
that
is
the
common
denominator
among
those
three
words.
the
only
--
the
only
way
you
can
explain
putting
those
three
words
together
is
the
relationship
to
mining.
and
if
we
assume
that
there's
any
cohesion
within
this
single
class
of
income,
i
think
it
has
to
be
explained
in
terms
of
the
relation
to
mineral
products.
by
the
way,
when
i
say
mining,
i'm
including
oil
and
gas,
and
the
extracting
industry.
the
second
evidence
i
think,
is
the
--
if
one
interpreted
discovery
in
--
in
subparagraph
(b)
to
include
inventions,
subparagraph
(c),
would
be
superfluous.
subparagraph
(c)
defines
is
another
and
separate
class
of
income,
income
from
the
sale
of
patent,
formulae
or
processes.
now,
if
income
from
the
use
of
an
invention
or
patent
--
patents
formulae
and
processes
are
ultimately
all
inventions
and
if
income
from
the
use
of
them
in
manufacturing
the
product
were
included
in
class
b
as
income
form
discovery,
a
fortiori
income
from
the
sale
of
the
invention
itself
would
be
included
in
class
b
as
income
from
discovery
and
there
would
be
nothing
left
for
class
c,
subparagraph
(c)
to
do.
that
--
that's
the
rhetorical
question
asked
by
judge
aldrich
in
--
in
the
polaroid
case,
but
if
there
is
a
big
hole
and
it
tends
for
the
big
cat,
need
there
be
a
small
hole
for
the
small
one?
now
third
is
that
from
the
express
inclusion
as
an
eligible
class,
but
income
from
the
sale
of
inventions,
it
can
be
inferred
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
income
from
the
use
of
inventions.
that
is
nothing
more
than
the
inclusio
unius,
etcetera.
the
--
and
there
is
a
--
a
fourth
consideration
which
drawn
from
the
face
statute
of
the
homogeneity
of
the
classes
within
themselves.
the
importance
of
the
classes
is
that
you
apply
the
quantitative
test
to
each
class
separately,
the
115%
of
the
average
test.
now
that
means
that
all
the
items
of
income
included
within
a
particular
class
in
the
taxable
year
in
order
to
decide
whether
their
abnormal
in
amount,
you
compare
them
with
all
the
items
of
income
included
--
belonging
to
that
same
class
in
prior
years,
even
on
the
maybe
different
items
of
income.
now,
that
comparison
makes
sense
only
if
the
items
within
a
single
class
have
something
in
common
that
--
that
this
homogeneity
within
the
class.
now,
the
inference
i
asked
you
to
draw
from
that
is
this.
if
congress
intended
to
make
eligible
income
from
the
use
of
a
patent,
it
would
surely
have
included
that
income
in
the
class
with
income
from
the
sale
of
the
patent
(i.e.
class
c)
and
not
in
the
class
which
the
taxpayer
contends
was
income
from
the
sale
of
oil
wells
and
goldmines,
which
is
class
b.
so
from
the
face
of
the
statute,
i
think
that
there
are
--
there
is
a
great
deal
of
evidence
that
discovery
was
here
used
in
the
--
in
the
mining
sense.
going
beyond
the
statute,
there's
confirmation
in
--
elsewhere
in
the
internal
revenue
code
itself,
which
where
a
discovery
is
used
in
provisions
expressly
limited
to
the
mining
industry,
we
set
forth
two
of
them
in
page
1
of
our
appendix
sections
105
and
114
(b)
(2).
i
will
mention
here
only
section
105,
because
i
think
that
is
really
the
more
important
one.
that
limits
the
income
tax
on
gain
from
the
sale
of
mineral
properties
if,
but
only
if,
the
value
of
those
properties
was
established,
“by
prospecting
or
exploration
or
discovery-work
done
by
the
taxpayer”.
now
that
provision
dates
back
to
1918.
it's
been
in
the
statute
ever
since
then,
with
one
very
brief
exception
during
the
1930s.
though
now,
it's
limited
to
gas
and
oil
properties,
it
originally
applied
to
all
mineral
properties.
the
significance
of
that
i'm
--
don't
like
too
much
of
it,
but
the
significance
is
that
those
three
words
used
together
in
combination,
have
been
used
together
in
companies
for
a
long
time
in
the
patent
statutes
themselves,
to
refer
to
the
mining
industry.
now
that
confirms
that
that
is
the
common
denominator
and
that
is
what
explains
the
use
of
those
three
words
together
described
as
the
single
class
of
income.
finally,
what
i
think
is
really
the
most
conclusive
proof
is
the
legislative
history
of
--
of
this
particular
provision
itself.
section
456
present
here,
was
taken
directly
and
in
large
part,
verbatim
from
section
721
of
the
excess
profits
tax
act
that
was
in
effect
during
world
war
ii
and
the
only
significant
change
in
the
paragraph
(2)
in
two
provisions
was
in
the
description
of
the
classes
of
income
now
covered
by
subparagraphs
(b)
and
(c).
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
it
is.
but,
i
--
i
think
i
can
make
the
comparison
easier
for
you
if
you
will
look
at
our
reply
brief
at
pages
10
and
11,
there
i
--
i've
set
out
the
provision
side
by
side
as
they
appeared
in
the
world
war
ii
law
and
the
--
and
the
korean
war
law
at
page
10
and
11
of
the
government's
reply
brief
which,
is
in
numbers
151
and
159.
the
--
you
will
see
the
first
provision
quoted
is
the
provision
that
appeared
in
the
world
war
ii
law
as
class
c.
that
included
as
knowledge
per
class
of
income,
income
resulting
from
exploration,
discovery,
prospecting,
research
or
development
of
tangible
property,
patents,
formulae
or
processes.
that
provision
expressly
included
the
very
kind
of
income
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
income
resulting
from
research
and
development
of
tangible
property
and
also
it
included
income
resulting
from
patents
by
use
as
well
as
by
sale.
so
the
income
involved
here
would
--
was
expressly
included
in
the
world
war
ii
law.
now,
the
changes
and
as
i
say,
this
is
the
only
significant
change
made
in
this
paragraph
of
the
two
provisions,
that
class
was
broken
down
into
two
classes
which
found
--
which
are
now
classes
b
and
c
and
part
of
it
was
omitted.
i
was
--
the
two
classes
taken
from
its
former
single
class
are
b,
income
resulting
from
exploration,
discovery
or
prospecting
and
c,
income
from
the
sale
of
--
of
patents,
formulae,
or
processes.
the
omissions
are
the
important
thing.
what
was
omitted
was
--
was
the
phrase
research
or
--
research
or
development
of
tangible
property
and
in
addition,
income
resulting
from
patents,
formulae
and
processes
was
limited
to
income
resulting
from
the
sale
of
the
patent
itself,
not
the
use
of
the
patent.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
that
departure
was
purposeful
and
necessarily
very
purpose
was
to
exclude
the
kind
of
income
involved
here.
and
the
committee
reports
--
the
committee
reports
expressly
say
that
that
was
the
purpose.
the
house
reports
which
was
repeated
verbatim
by
the
senate
is
set
forth
the
next
page
of
our
reply
brief
on
page
12
and
you
will
see
that
after
stating
that
the
world
war
ii
law
had
--
may
--
included
as
eligible
--
eligible
class
of
income,
income
resulting
from
the
sale
of
tangible
property
arising
out
of
research
and
development.
the
report
notes
that
that
provision
was
a
potential
loophole
of
major
dimensions.
and
that
it
was
being
omitted
from
the
classes
of
income
for
which
this
relief
was
available
because
there
appeared
to
be
no
means
of
restricting
such
an
adjustment
to
truly
meritorious
cases
without
undesirably
broad
degree
of
administrative
discretion.
my
--
my
point
is
simply
that
that
--
this
is
the
very
kind
of
income
that
was
specifically
included
in
the
world
war
ii
law
and
just
as
specifically
deleted
from
the
korean
war
law.
and
i
don't
know
how
congress
could've
made
any
plainer
without
expressly
stating
the
negative
its
purpose
not
to
provide
relief
for
this
kind
of
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
was
the
report
i
was
just
(voice
overlap)
quoting
from
at
page
12.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
the
house
report
as
quoted
from
the
house
report,
the
senate
report
is
identical.
it
was
taken
verbatim
from
the
house
report.
now,
the
taxpayer
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
more
--
no
more
than
--
than
the
statement
that
this
provision,
the
provision
including
research
and
development
income
was
a
potential
loophole
of
major
dimensions,
because
there
appeared
to
be
no
means
of
restricting
such
an
adjustment
to
truly
meritorious
cases
other
than
by
the
introduction
of
an
unduly
broad
amount
of
administrative
discretion.
it's
with
the
administrative
necessity
and
i
will
in
a
minute
explain
what
the
administrative
difficulties
were
that
explains
this
reference
to
the
need
for
administrative
discretion,
if
you're
going
to
have
that
kind
of
provision.
the
--
the
taxpayer
here
says
that
interpreting
discovery
to
include
truly
basic
inventions
which
they
claim
there
is
this,
when
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
deny
that,
this
is
up
on
summary
judgment
and
we
accept
their
characterization.
this
is
a
very
important
invention.
they
say
that
if
you
include
very
important
inventions
within
discovery,
you
don't
have
the
administrative
difficulties
that
congress
was
worried
about
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
what
those
administrate
difficulties
were.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
as
i
understand
their
argument,
they
do
not
argue
that
discovery
includes
all
inventions.
i
think
they
can
speak
with
themselves,
as
i
understand
their
argument,
they
would
limit
it
to
basic
inventions
or
important
inventions.
i'm
not
--
i
don't
want
to
commit
to
that
position.
the
--
the
kind
of
difficulty
that
you
had
under
the
section
721
of
the
world
war
ii
law
as
applied
to
inventions
and
patents,
which
were
eligible
for
relief
was
this.
the
relief
applied
only
to
the
income
resulting
from
the
research
and
development
or
from
the
patent.
now,
if
the
owner
of
the
patent
licensed
others
to
use
the
patent
and
got
only
royalty
income,
the
problem
was
--
was
easy.
all
of
his
royalties
resulted
from
the
patent.
but
if
he
used
the
patent
himself,
manufactured
the
item,
sold
the
item
and
the
income
you
got
was
simply
sales
income,
how
could
you
decide
how
much
of
his
sales
income
was
attributable
to
the
value
of
the
patent
and
how
much
was
simply
an
ordinary
manufacturing
profit
attributable
to
--
to
a
fair
return
on
his
capital
and
his
investment
in
plant
and
equipment
to
his
sales
program
and
labor
and
all
the
other
factors
that
go
into
the
production
of
income.
well,
there
was
simply
no
way
to
do
it.
the
--
the
regulations
made
it
clear,
you
have
to
make
that
segregation.
the
--
the
manufacture
--
manufacturing
and
selling
it
--
a
product
that
he
developed,
who
wanted
relief
had
to
segregate
what
part
of
that
sales
income
was
due
to
the
invention
and
what
part
was
due
to
manufacturing
general
demand
capital,
etcetera.
the
only
place
that
the
regulations
suggested
how
you
might
do
it
was
the
case
where
you
also
licensed
others
you
could
use
that
royalty
as
a
measure
or
the
sort
of
constructive
royalty
and
charge
that
part
of
his
income
to
the
patent
and
--
and
that
rest
elsewhere.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that.
i
--
i'm
sure
the
treasury
was
involved
in
the
drafting
of
whole
statute,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
specific
recommendations
about
this
provision.
you
--
you
can
see
the
difficulties
that
are
--
were
encountered
and
one
must
pursue
them
i
don't
think
we
need
to.
we
cite
a
group
of
cases
in
our
brief
at
pages
47
and
48
applying
the
old
provision.
i
was
just
--
the
ramsey
accessories
case
is
probably
the
leading
case,
these
other
factors
are
called
in
the
--
721
bar,
the
--
the
ramsey
factors
from
the
name
of
that
case.
now
the
taxpayer
says,
he
doesn't
have
that
problem
here
because
it's
a
basic
invention.
well,
how
does
he
allocate
his
sales
income
between
the
value
of
the
patent
and
his
ordinary
manufacturing
profit?
he
doesn't
say
in
his
brief,
but
if
you
look
at
the
record
at
pages
10
and
11
of
the
record,
you'll
find
out
how
he
did
it
in
his
claim
for
refund.
you
will
see
that
he
had
gross
profit
and
i
think,
in
1951,
the
year
1951
was
one
of
the
years.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
8
or
9
--
yes,
8,
9.
see
at
gross
profit
from
the
sale
of
those
two
items
at
$10,700,000.
how
much
of
that
gross
profit
from
the
sale
of
those
two
items
is
attributable
to
manufacturing
and
the
other
factors
of
production
and
how
much
to
the
value
of
the
patent,
the
royalty
element?
the
answer,
the
reason
why
it's
simple
to
do
is
that
the
taxpayer
attributes
all
of
the
income
to
the
patents.
every
cent
of
the
income
is
due
to
the
patents
and
as
he
computes
it,
the
net
income
by
the
way
was
about
$8,000,000
out
of
this
$10,000,000,
as
he
computes
it,
although
he
had
$8,000,000
net
profit
from
these
two
products,
he
didn't
earn
a
dime
on
his
capital
invested
in
the
manufacturing,
on
his
advertising
activities,
on
his
sales
and
promotional
activities,
during
1951.
all
of
the
$8,000,000
he
says
was
earned
actually
back
in
1946
and
1949
and
he
just
broke
even
in
1951.
now,
obviously
that
is
not
all
income,
which
is
attributable
to
the
development
of
this
item.
no
doubt
that
it
--
some
of
it
is,
we
don't
deny
that
and
that
depends
on
how
good
a
patent
is
and
how
great
--
how
much
the
monopoly
that
is
--
is
given
by
the
patent
is
worth,
but
certainly,
they
at
least
also
made
ordinary
manufacturing
profit.
i
suggest
the
failure
of
a
taxpayer
to
be
able
to
suggest
how
you
breakdown
your
sales
income
between
the
patent
and
the
manufacturing
and
other
activities,
simply
confirms
the
wisdom
of
congress.
and
this
is
the
administrative
problem
that
caused
them
to
delete
that
class
of
income
in
taking
out
a
provision
which
would've
required
that
kind
of
breakdown
and
i
think
ultimately
there's
no
basis
for
construing
the
discovery
provision
in
subparagraph
(b)
to
recreate
those
problems.
thank
you.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
let's
say
we
agree
that
there
is
a
difference
in
degree
in
the
quality
of
inventions.
some
are
major
and
some
are
minor.
we
don't
quite
understand
where
the
definition
of
discovery
comes
from
that
would
include
one
and
not
the
other.
the
difference
is
not
that
one
is
whether
something
has
been
discovered;
the
difference
has
been
what
has
been
discovered.
you
discover
more,
you
discover
less,
but
they
are
both
equally
discoveries
in
the
dictionary
sense
of
discovery.
the
important
thing
though
i
think
is
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
456
for
thinking
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
difference
as
to
the
difference
in
degree
between
big
inventions
and
small
inventions.
the
administrative
difficulty
that
explains
why
congress
took
out
the
statute
research
and
development
is
not
in
distinguishing
kinds
of
inventions.
the
taxpayer
says
that
if
you
have
a
new
product,
all
of
the
income
from
its
sale
would
not
exist
but
for
the
invention.
of
course
that's
true
in
a
“but
for”
sense.
the
“but
for”
causation
is
not
the
same
as
how
you
allocate
the
income.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
the
polaroid
camera
is
a
good
example.
it's
relatively
expensive
item
and
it
presumably
would
appeal
only
to
people
who
are
relatively
affluent
and
to
the
extent
that
the
stimulus
to
the
war
time
economy
added
to
the
disposable
income,
it
also
added
to
the
demand
for
the
camera.
more
importantly,
however,
the
demand
for
a
new
product
is
not
readymade.
you
have
to
make
a
demand
and
the
way
that
you
create
a
demand
is
by
advertising
and
that's
the
way
polaroid
created
the
demand
for
its
camera.
now,
quite
apart
from
those
factors
certainly
some
of
the
income
realized
is
simply
the
income
from
manufacturing.
if
you
--
if
you
manufacture
and
sell
even
a
non-patented
item,
you
usually
make
a
profit,
so
that
you
cannot
say
that
all
of
the
profit
is
attributable
to
the
value
of
the
invention.
that
is
the
royalty
element
of
the
profit.
you
would
have
to
segregate
out
of
the
sales
income,
a
constructive
royalty
as
it
were,
that
you
would
attribute
as
being
due
to
the
value
of
the
patent.
you
would
have
to
allocate
the
rest
of
the
income
to
manufacturing
profit,
sales
promotion
activities,
return
on
capital
and
the
investment.
you
can't
say
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct
in
this
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
statutory
interpretation
problem.
now
as
to
the
application
here,
the
government
counsel
entered
a
stipulation,
stipulating
the
amounts
of
net
abnormal
income
and
the
attribution
to
prior
years.
i
don't
want
to
back
out
of
that
stipulation.
the
stipulation
is
erroneous.
the
stipulation
is
based
upon
the
same
erroneous
theory
that
the
taxpayer
is
arguing
here
namely
that
all
income
realized
from
the
sale
of
the
polaroid
camera
is
attributable
to
the
value
of
the
patent,
none
of
it
attributable
to
the
manufacturing,
to
the
capitals
of
the
labor,
to
the
advertising
and
promotional
activities.
now,
i'm
not
asking
to
be
relieved
from
that
stipulation.
i
don't
know
what
caused
government
counsel
to
enter
it.
there
may
have
been
other
reasons.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
not
there
on
the
construction
of
the
statute.
i'm
trying
to
explain
why
congress
changed
the
statute
from
section
721
and
omitted
in
section
456
research
and
development
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
we
didn't
find
it
impossible
to
do
so
because
we
proceeded
on
erroneous
theory.
it
is
very
easy
--
it's
very
easy
if
you
attribute
all
the
income
to
the
invention.
there
isn't
a
problem
of
allocation.
the
regulations
specifically
require
that
income
from
the
manufacturer
of
patented
item
be
allocated
as
between
the
manufacturing
and
other
factors
and
the
value
of
the
patent.
that
was
under
721
under
section
--
when
this
kind
of
item
was
included.
that's
regulations
112
section
35.721-7.
and
the
way
the
regulations
suggest
doing
it
is
in
the
case
where
the
owner
of
the
patent,
not
only
manufactures
and
sells
the
item,
but
also
licenses
someone
else
to
do
it
for
a
royalty.
in
that
case,
you
have
a
measure
of
the
value
of
the
patent
and
out
of
this
own
manufacturing
income,
you
take
in
a
part
equivalent
to
the
royalty
and
call
that
the
income
resulting
from
the
invention.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
if
i
accept
this
sti
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
--
no,
no.
the
stipulation
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yeah.
the
stipulation
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
that
is
right.
but
we
did
not
stipulate
that
this
qualified
as
an
eligible
class
of
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
i'm
really
arguing
to
the
question
of
eligibility.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
i
might
say
that
all
of
the
cases
under
section
721
did
involve
manufacturers
who
were
selling
their
own
products.
you
never
had
this
royalty
measured
and
in
fact
what
the
tax
court
ended
up
doing
was
expressly
recognizing
that
the
allocation
was
a
matter
of
opinion
and
judgment
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
admitted
that
no
two
people
could
ever
agree
on
how
you
allocated
it.
and
the
way
it
resolved
the
cases
in
practice
was
to
end
up
with
a
conclusory
finding
of
fact
stating
what
the
allocation
is
without
attempting
to
explain
how
they
arrived
at.
and
that
--
that
is
what
congress
meant
when
it
said
that
it
could
not
provide
for
relief
for
this
kind
of
thing
without
an
undesirably
broad
range
of
discretionary
judgment.
now,
congress
also
gave
a
--
and
that's
equally
true
if
it's
brand
new
product.
you
still
have
that
problem
of
allocation.
congress
also
gave
a
separate
reason,
namely
that,
the
need
for
relief
for
this
kind
of
income
was
not
as
great
as
the
need
for
relief
for
other
kinds
of
income.
that
appears
in
the
committee
report
at
page
12
of
our
reply
brief.
i
would
like
to
suggest
why
that
is,
why
there
is
a
less
need
for
the
relief.
the
other
classes
of
income,
classes
a,
c
and
d,
namely
judgments,
the
sale
of
the
invention
itself
or
change
of
accounting
method.
now,
those
are
all
clearly
one
time
transactions
that
are
unusual
in
the
life
of
the
taxpayer.
i
would
say
a
lumping
of
income
in
one
year
of
the
events
giving
rise
to
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
yet.
now,
the
taxpayers
claim
that
their
equitable
right
to
relief
the
justification
for
extended
relief
is
just
like
that
for
oil
wells
included
in
class
d
and
they
make
that
similarity.
now,
because
they're
oil
production,
you
do
have
a
continuing
production
of
income.
it
isn't
the
one
shot
we
see.
now,
the
difference
there,
i
think
for
justification
for
including
minerals
is
that
the
taxpayer
is
using
out
a
wasting
asset.
he
is
selling
off
his
underlying
oil
deposit.
now,
that's
important
for
this
reason.
if
he
greatly
increased
his
production
of
oil
during
the
excess
profits
tax
years,
he
really
wouldn't
be
better
off
because
he
wouldn't
have
that
same
oil
to
sell
after
the
excess
profits
tax
years
and
there
would
be
a
strong
incentive
for
him
to
reduce
his
production
during
the
excess
profit
tax
years
and
save
his
oil
until
the
excess
profit
tax
was
gone.
and
i
think
that
is
essentially
a
justification
for
allowing
this
relief
to
the
mineral
industries.
now
in
a
case
of
invention
of
patent,
you
lose
nothing
when
you
produce
more
during
the
war
years
because
the
patent
expires
not
over
units
of
production,
but
over
time
and
the
more
you
produce,
the
more
you
can
still
produce
more
later,
so
they're
very
different
in
nature
in
that
respect.
now,
more
--
the
other
reason
is
this.
most
people
who
have
research
and
development
income
are
continually
engaged
in
research
and
development.
this
is
not
one
item
that
they
discovered.
searle
has
very
large
research
department.
their
business
is
developing
new
drugs
and
selling
them.
that
is
also
true
to
polaroid.
and
during
the
excess
profit
tax
years,
they
were
engaging
in
research
and
development
and
deducting
the
cost
of
research
and
development.
now,
to
be
logically
consistent,
if
we
were
to
throw
back
to
the
earlier
years,
the
income
resulting
from
the
prior
research
and
development,
you
ought
to
bring
into
the
excess
profit
tax
years
the
future
income
which
results
from
the
--
their
research
and
development
during
the
excess
profits
tax
years.
now,
i
think
it's
obviously
not
a
practical
thing
to
do
and
i
think
the
congress'
solution
was
sound
to
treat
research
and
development
as
a
current
item.
you
take
the
income
into
account
when
you
receive
it
and
you
don't
try
to
trace
each
item
back
to
the
years
in
which
it
was
developed.
now
--
so
i
think
those
are
the
two
reasons
why
research
and
development
income
was
taken
out
of
the
eligible
classes
in
the
korean
war
law,
both
the
administrative
feasibility
of
segregating
the
income
and
the
lack
of
a
pressing
and
even
say
debatable
justification
for
providing
that
relief.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
--
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may
now,
to
the
last
sentence
of
section
456
(a)
(2).
this
is
the
alternative
argument
that
is
made
by
both
taxpayers,
which
i
did
not
deal
with
yesterday.
we
have
set
forth
the
section
in
a
skeletal
form
on
page
two
of
our
reply
brief.
that's
the
one,
the
consolidated
brief
in
151
and
169.
it's
in
skeletal
form
to
emphasize
the
provisions
relevant
to
this
question.
that
is
assuming
that
it
is
not
within
class
b,
they
argue
that
they're
entitled
to
relief
under
the
last
sentence
of
paragraph
(2).
that
sentence
reads
the
classification
of
income
of
any
class
not
described
in
subparagraphs
(a)
to
(d)
inclusive
shall
be
subject
to
regulations.
their
argument
is
that
that
makes
all
income
of
whatever
nature
and
of
whatever
kind
eligible
for
relief.
now,
before
i
try
to
answer
that
argument,
i
would
like
to
state
what
the
significance
of
it
is.
in
terms,
it
is
all
inclusive.
it
includes
all
kinds
of
income,
but
it
doesn't
do
you
any
good
to
have
to
qualify
as
abnormal
income
unless
there
is
a
basis
for
attribution,
a
basis
for
attributing
the
income
to
prior
years
under
subsection
b.
now,
virtually
the
only
kind
of
income
that
is
not
expressly
provided
for
elsewhere
in
the
statute
for
which
there
could
be
claimed
a
basis
of
attribution
is
research
and
development
income.
so
the
net
effect
of
their
argument
really
is,
the
practical
operation,
to
say
that
the
last
sentence
brings
back
within
the
statute
the
very
kind
of
income
that
congress
expressly
took
out
of
the
enumerated
classes.
now,
it
may
be
that
that's
a
necessary
result
of
the
last
sentence.
i
think
it's
a
rather
remarkable
result
and
one
that
should
be
avoided
if
possible.
turning
to
what
the
last
sentence
does
mean,
i
confess
that
i
have
no
easy
answer.
there
is
no
interpretation
of
the
last
sentence
simply
from
the
words
that
is
consistent
with
the
rest
of
the
statute.
in
order
to
give
it
a
meaning,
i
would
like
to
go
through
the
exercise
by
first
trying
to
show
that
the
last
sentence
doesn't
mean
anything
and
then
show
how
you
can
give
it
a
meaning,
which
is
consistent
with
the
statute.
i
would
do
that
first
just
on
the
face
of
the
statute
and
then
show
that
under
the
legislative
history
that
in
fact
got
into
the
statute
apparently
by
inadvertence.
and
i
--
after
that,
i
will
then
try
to
say
how
we
think
you
can
read
it
to
give
some
meaning
to
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
as
i
say,
that's
more
of
an
exercise.
i
don't
think
this
court
will
need
to
hold
that
to
dispose
of
this
case.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
reason
i
do
that
--
the
reason
i
do
that
is
to
give
me
a
license
to
force
the
words
into
another
meaning
because
the
interpretation
i
would
suggest
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
a
duty,
if
you
will.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
it
is.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
confess.
i
don't
understand
what
they
did
this
time,
but
i
will
come
to
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
i
will
come
to
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
yes.
this
act
was
passed,
however,
i
must
say
in
very
short
order
and
it
is
perhaps
unique
in
its
complexity.
i
don't
think
you
can
find
another
statute
that
is
quite
as
involved
in
this
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
well,
i
think
you
remember
in
(inaudible)
case,
i
think
there
was
some
evidence
that
not
every
part
of
the
statute
have
been
fixed
up.
there
are
some
discrepancies
in
the
statute.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
still
think
it
is
a
useful
exercise
however
you
come
out
in
the
end.
the
last
sentence
is
as
i
have
said
provides
for
the
classification
of
income
of
any
class
not
described.
now,
literally,
that
seems
to
provide
for
the
classification
of
all
income
because
all
income
is
of
some
class
and
that's
basically
their
argument.
we
can
concede
that,
that
all
income
is
of
a
class,
but
what
happens
to
the
class
after
you
classified
it.
now,
the
last
sentence
doesn't
tell
you
that.
you
have
to
go
back
to
paragraph
one,
which
is
the
operative
definition
of
abnormal
income
and
paragraph
one
says
that
the
term
abnormal
income
means
an
income
of
any
class
described
in
paragraph
two,
not
income
of
any
class,
but
any
class
describing
paragraph
two.
and
paragraph
two
starts
out
by
saying
that
each
of
the
following
subparagraphs
shall
be
held
to
describe
a
separate
class
of
income.
and
the
last
sentence
says
that
the
classification
of
income
of
any
class
not
described
in
the
subparagraphs
shall
be
subject
regulations.
so
the
last
sentence
--
income
is
not
described
and
the
definition
of
abnormal
income
applies
only
to
income
which
is
described.
and
so
that
the
last
sentence
literally,
reading
it
very
literally
and
i
confess
this
is
a
very
literal
reading,
the
last
sentence
provides
for
classification
that
has
no
operative
effect.
now,
to
show
how
it
got
into
the
statute.
it
must
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes.
but
abnormal
income
is
defined
as
including
only
the
--
only
income
of
any
class
which
is
described.
and
so
classes
of
income
which
are
not
described
are
not
abnormal
income.
so
they
are
classes
of
income
but
they're
not
abnormal.
they're
not
eligible
to
qualify
as
abnormal
classes.
now,
i
don't
expect
anyone
to
be
persuaded
by
this
argument
as
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
i
just
want
to
set
up
the
problem
in
those
terms.
now,
the
way
that
last
sentence
got
into
the
statute
is
this.
as
i
have
said,
456
came
from
section
721
of
the
world
war
ii
law.
in
the
1940
act,
section
721
was
in
very
different
form
and
was
limited
to
the
six
classes
of
income.
it
was
revised
in
1941
into
the
form
that
appears
on
pages
six
and
seven
of
our
reply
brief.
you
will
note
that
there,
the
abnormal
income
is
defined
to
me,
income
of
any
class
includable
in
gross
income,
any
class
at
all.
it
is
not
limited
to
any
class
described
in
paragraph
(2).
it
means
income
of
any
class.
now,
with
that
definition
of
abnormal
income,
you
have
to
provide
for
classification
of
all
classes
of
income.
and
so,
there,
paragraph
(2)
did
define
separate
classes
of
income
and
after
enumerating
six
classes
provided
for
the
classification
of
all
other
income.
now,
the
important
thing
about
the
last
sentence
in
section
721
is
that
all
it
did
was
to
provide
for
the
grouping,
the
classification
which
items
you
put
together
and
which
of
those
classes,
if
any,
were
eligible
for
relief
was
determined
by
paragraph
one
and
the
reason
why
721
was
very
broad
in
scope
is
because
paragraph
one
defined
abnormal
income
as
meaning
income
of
any
class
includable
in
gross
income,
all
income.
now,
that's
not
quite
as
strange
as
it
sounds
because
i
have
said
--
said
before,
abnormal
income,
the
test
of
abnormal
income
is
only
the
first
step
and
you
then
have
to
show
that
it
is
attributable
to
prior
years.
the
effect
of
this
definition
of
abnormal
income
was
to
lead
to
the
attribution
requirements
in
subsection
b,
the
function
of
limiting
relief
to
the
proper
kinds
of
income,
but
there
was
no
test
in
subsection
a,
no
qualitative
test
of
what
is
abnormal
income.
any
income
could
be
abnormal
and
that
was
the
function
of
the
last
sentence,
purely,
the
accounting
breakdown
of
income
into
several
classes.
we
then
come
to
the
korean
war
law.
the
house
bill,
where
it
originated
repeated
all
the
same
language
of
section
721,
including
the
unlimited
definition
of
abnormal
income
in
paragraph
(1)
as
meaning,
income
of
any
class
includable
in
gross
income
and
therefore
also
the
last
sentence
providing
for
the
classification
of
all
income.
the
only
change
the
house
made
in
the
bill
from
the
predecessor
bill
was
in
the
described
classes,
which
were
cut
down
to
four
classes
and
there
was
that
change
of
the
research
and
development
was
omitted.
now,
literally,
if
you
read
its
bill
literally,
it
really
hadn't
done
very
much
because
although
it
took
research
and
development
income
out
of
the
described
classes,
abnormal
income
wasn't
limited
to
the
described
classes.
so
the
only
defect
literally
was
that
research
and
development
had
to
be
put
into
another
class,
but
which
was
equally
eligible
for
relief.
now,
its
report
however,
the
report
of
the
house
committee
which
is
at
page
12,
i
think
obviously
reflects
that
they
have
done
more
than
that.
it
states,
after
describing
the
kind
of
adjustment,
adjustments
of
this
type
are
limited
to
income
arising
out
of
at
least
the
four
classes.
it
then
has
the
discussion
that
i
have
talked
about
earlier
saying
why
they
have
deleted
research
and
development.
and
they
don't
speak
of
deleting
that
simply
from
enumerating
classes
to
put
it
some
place
else.
they
end
up
saying
that's
why
that
item
has
been
omitted
from
the
list
of
abnormal
types
of
income
for
which
a
reallocation
can
be
made
under
this
bill.
so
the
report
clearly
speaks
as
though
relief
were
limited
to
the
four
classes
and
none
other.
and
by
taking
research
and
development
out
of
the
enumerated
classes,
it
thought
it
was
denying
relief
altogether.
whereas
i
say,
the
bill
didn't
say
that.
the
bill
had
the
same
language
that'd
been
put
in,
in
1941
for
the
very
purpose
of
extending
relief
beyond
the
enumerated
classes.
now,
when
the
bill
got
to
the
senate,
the
senate
was
faced
with
a
choice
whether
they
wanted
to
agree
with
the
house
report
or
with
the
house
bill,
because
they
were
very
different
things.
and
it
shows
the
house
report
and
agreed
with
the
report,
it
adopted
the
report
verbatim,
but
it
amended
the
bill
to
make
the
bill
conform
to
the
report
and
they
did
that
by
two
amendments.
amendment
number
200
inserted
in
paragraph
one
the
phrase
described
in
paragraph
two
so
that
an
abnormal
income
was
defined
as
income
of
any
class
described
in
paragraph
two,
which
meant
the
quantitative
test.
now
--
i'm
sorry
--
which
meant
the
quantitative
test.
there's
always
the
quantitative
test.
after
you
establish
eligibility,
you
have
to
estab
--
meet
the
quantitative
test.
now,
since
it
limited
the
definition
of
abnormal
income
to
the
described
classes,
the
last
sentence
providing
for
the
classification
of
other
income
was
unnecessary,
so
it
deleted
that
sentence
in
amendment
201.
now,
at
that
point,
the
bill
said
exactly
what
the
committee
report
said
and
everything
was
very
clear.
then
the
bill
went
to
the
conference
and
in
conference,
what
happened
--
the
result
of
what
happened
is
very
clear.
the
conference
accepted
the
amendment
to
the
definition
of
abnormal
income
limiting
it
to
the
classes
described
in
paragraph
(2),
but
rejected
the
amendment
striking
the
last
sentence.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes,
yes,
yes.
so
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
house
did
not
recede
on
that
amendment.
so
that
the
effect
is
that
we
ended
up
with
--
and
the
bill
was
passed
in
its
form,
we
ended
up
with
a
bill
with
one
amendment
to
the
definition
of
abnormal
income
which
literally
made
the
last
sentence
surplusage
but
they
kept
the
last
sentence.
now,
i
don't
know
why
the
conference
committee
did
that.
i
don't
think
anyone
else
knows
why
they
did
it.
i
think
it
is
inconsistent
action
and
i
think
to
give
--
if
you
read
the
last
sentence,
the
way
that
the
taxpayers
suggest
it
should
be
read,
you
deny
all
effect
to
the
addition
of
the
limitation
described
in
paragraph
(2)
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
it
is
a
classification
provided
for
in
paragraph
(2).
i
agree
with
that,
but
certainly
the
author
of
the
words
described
in
paragraph
(2),
that
is
the
senate,
meant
by
that
the
classes
described
in
paragraph
(2)
and
literally,
the
last
sentence
says
provides
for
the
classification
of
any
class
of
income
not
described.
so
it
uses
the
same
word
described,
it
says
not
described
and
i
think
one
or
the
other
of
the
provisions
doesn't
fit,
that
they
don't
belong
together.
now,
the
simplest
thing
to
do
is
to
say
that
congress
just
slipped
out
and
you
ought
to
read
it
literally,
you
read
it
literally.
the
last
sentence
doesn't
have
any
operative
effect
and
so
you
ignore
it.
now,
you
don't
have
to
do
that.
how
do
you
give
meaning
to
the
last
sentence?
the
taxpayer
says
that
our
reading
of
the
last
sentence
results
in
our
reading
the
same
language
in
two
acts,
the
world
war
ii
act
and
this
act
to
mean
different
things.
that
is
not
quite
right
because
if
you
read
the
last
sentence
to
mean
exactly
the
same
thing
that
it
didn't
mean
in
721,
it
would
mean
nothing
because
all
in
that
in
721
was
accounting
and
it
didn't
say
--
it
was
not
the
last
sentence
that
said
that
the
resulting
classes
were
eligible,
it
was
paragraph
(1)
that
said
that
and
there
is
a
different
paragraph
(1)
and
it's
really
from
paragraph
(1)
that
we
derive
a
different
ultimate
effect
of
the
last
sentence.
now,
since
read
isn't
a
classification
provision
alone,
the
last
sentence
doesn't
do
anything.
you
have
to
really
read
it
as
also
not
only
providing
for
classification,
but
somehow
providing
that
the
resulting
classes
are
to
be
eligible
to
qualify
as
abnormal
income.
and
our
interpretation
ultimately
amounts
to
reading
it
as
though
it
said
not
with
the
classification
of
any
class
of
income
not
described
through
its
sets
of
regulations,
but
as
though
it
said
the
eligibility
of
any
class
of
income
not
described
in
the
regulations,
in
the
subparagraphs
shall
be
subject
to
regulations.
that
is
to
say
the
secretary
has
a
discretionary
power
to
prescribe
specific
additional
classes
which
shall
be
eligible
for
relief.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
first
circuit
read
it
that
way.
that
is
right
and
essentially,
that
is
the
interpretation
given
to
it
by
the
regulations
although
i
think
actually
the
regulations
are
somewhat
at
least
(inaudible)
worded
to
leave
open
the
possibility
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
additional
class
of
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
way
the
--
that
is
consistent
with
senator
george's
statement
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
which
he
said
that
the
effect
was
to
authorize
the
secretary
to
prescribe
additional
classes
of
income.
that
is
also
the
effect
given
to
it
by
the
staff
of
the
joint
committee
on
internal
revenue,
still
treated
in
relief
as
limited
to
define
classes,
but
with
some
discretion,
the
commissioner
or
the
secretary
to
add
classes.
so
it
doesn't
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that's
right
and
i
think
that
really
is
the
way
the
regulations
have
interpreted
and
the
regulations
have
specifically
excluded
and
denied
relief
to
research
and
development
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
informed
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
yes,
i've
informed
that's
right
for
my
authority.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right,
right.
well,
i
am
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
not
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
i'm
informed
that
was
the
world
war
ii
law
which
did
include
research
and
development
income.
that
was
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
justice,
are
you
reading
from
87
congressional
record?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
1941.
that's
the
world
war
ii
law.
we're
into
the
korean
war
law.
that
was
the
provision
that
did
expressly
provide
for
research
development.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
and
that
provision
was
left
out
of
our
provision.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
we
admit
this
would
have
been
covered
under
the
world
war
ii
law.
thank
you.
