mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court?
there
are
two
questions
involved
in
searle's
case.
first
is
whether
the
district
court
erroneously
granted
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
instead
of
letting
searle
prove
that
its
dramamine
and
banthine
were
discoveries
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
the
second
question
equally
important
which
i
also
ought
to
be
able
to
cover,
is
an
alternative
one
namely
whether
the
district
court
erroneously
granted
the
government's
summary
--
motion
for
summary
judgment,
instead
of
letting
searle
prove
that
the
income
from
these
two
drugs
could
probably
be
classified
under
the
last
sentence
or
on
the
clause
of
the
statue
and
the
regulations
in
question.
under
rule
42
(b),
to
answer
the
question
that
chief
justice
put
to
mr.
barnett,
the
remaining
issues
by
court
order
have
been
held
in
abeyance,
such
issues
as
involving
competition
of
amount
of
abnormal
income,
the
years
of
attribution
and
so
forth.
the
facts
are
largely
in
dispute
as
the
government
conceded
in
the
district
court
but
some
of
them
are
disclosed
by
the
error
record
that's
before
this
court.
as
to
the
facts
established
by
this
record,
the
record
shows
that
searle
is
seeking
to
recover
part
of
the
excess
profits
taxes
that
it
had
paid
in
1950
through
1952,
on
income
from
the
discovery
of
these
drugs.
dramamine
is,
of
course,
the
famous
anti-seasick
or
motion
sickness
remedy,
whereas
banthine,
is
an
equally
sensational
remedy
for
the
treatment
of
peptic
ulcers,
normally
rendering
surgery
obsolete
in
such
cases.
searle
advised
the
district
court
that
it
intended
to
prove
that
unlike
all
it's
other
products,
both
these
drugs
were
breakthrough
discoveries,
involving
new
compositions
of
matter
and
that
their
effect
on
the
human
body
constituted
an
unprecedented
approach
to
the
treatment
of
motion
sickness
and
peptic
ulcers.
searle
intended
to
show
that
the
contemporary
medical
literature
of
other
publications
termed
these
two
drugs
discoveries
for
they
were
not
mere
improvements
on
existing
drugs.
their
large
sales
and
widespread
in
the
--
imitations
were
further
indicia
that
both
of
these
were
genuine
or
breakthrough
discoveries.
but
in
the
alternative,
searle
intended
to
prove
at
the
trial
that
it
was
reasonable
and
appropriate
within
the
meaning
of
the
treasury
regulations,
to
classify
the
income
from
these
drugs
under
the
omnibus
last
sentence
of
the
statute,
even
if
it
should
not
qualify
under
subparagraph
(b)
in
the
discovery
provision.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
word
“discovery”
as
used
in
the
statute
does
confine
to
natural
resources.
during
the
three
years
in
question,
searle's
excess
in
income
tax
payments
totaled
about
19
million,
of
which
the
complaint
seeks
to
recover
about
three
and
a
half
million.
but
the
judgment
below
did
not
determine
that
searle
was
entitled
to
recover
any
part
of
this
amount
and
in
fact
under
the
complicated
computations
that
mr.
barnett
had
adverted
to,
the
district
court
might
conclude
that
the
plaintiff
indeed
was
not
entitled
to
recover
the
entire
amount
or
any
of
it.
in
this
connection,
the
court
will
be
interested
to
note
that
only
modest
recoveries
were
allowed
under
the
equivalent
provisions
of
the
world
war
ii
act.
this
korean
war
excess
profits
tax
act,
which
was
repealed
in
1953,
accords
special
treatment
to
income
resulting
from
discovery
and
other
classes
of
income,
if
it
--
it
falls
within
the
definition
section
of
the
act
and
the
definition
applies
to
income,
abnormal
in
kind
or
abnormal
at
amount.
searle's
incoming
question,
it
contends
is
abnormal
in
amount.
as
its
principal
ground
on
the
district
court,
the
government's
motion
for
summary
judgment
claimed
that
discovery
does
not
include
products
prepared
through
research
and
development.
the
motion
did
not
at
all
mention
searle's
alternative
claim
or
relief
under
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute.
as
to
both
of
these
grounds
and
in
the
teeth
of
the
regulation,
the
district
court
held
that
the
plaintiff's
income
was
not
entitled
a
relief
merely
because
it
arose
from
research
and
development.
our
first
point
is
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
discovery
would
include
these
drugs.
amphetamine
sulfate
was
so
termed
by
the
third
circuit
in
the
smith,
kline
and
french
case
recently
and
the
salts
for
the
treatment
of
anemia
is
so
described
by
the
eighth
circuit
throughout
its
preon
opinion.
interestingly
enough
at
the
famous
(inaudible)
hearings,
the
investigation
of
the
drug
industry
last
year,
important
breakthrough
drugs
like
these,
were
referred
to
as
discoveries.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
no,
the
particular
statute
was
not
however,
in
the
context
of
the
statute
and
the
very
hearings
on
the
statute,
two
other
drugs
were
mentioned
mr.
justice
harlan,
they
were
aureomycin
and
acth.
the
tax
court
also
used
the
term
discovery
on
a
non-mineral
sense,
when
it
was
dealing
with
the
equivalent
provisions
of
the
world
war
ii
had.
in
two
cases
that
i
found
and
preparing
for
the
day
and
are
not
in
our
brief.
in
the
w.p.
davis
case
in
5
b.t.a.
1195,
the
court
referred
the
plaintiff's
hosiery
machine
as
a
discovery
and
in
steel
or
bronze
piston
ring
corporation
in
13
b.t.a.
636,
the
court
referred
at
the
plaintiff's
piston
rings
as
a
discovery,
so
the
relief
--
so
that
the
word
was
used
in
a
non-mineral
sense
by
the
tax
court
itself
in
administering
the
earlier
provisions.
the
term
is
of
course
applied
to
really
new
drugs
by
common
usage
and
there
was
so
applied
in
the
medical
literature
and
the
other
newspaper
articles
dealing
with
these
two
drugs.
learned
articles
on
such
other
drugs
as
insulin
and
penicillin
referred
to
them
as
discoveries
and
as
even
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
stewart
noted,
the
constitution
of
course,
uses
the
term
discovery
in
a
non-mineral
sense.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
of
the
definitions
of
course,
but
it
does
not
the
colon
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
--
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well
the
whole
point
of
a
difference
between
discovery
and
invention
was
explored
by
judge
cranch
back
in
1841
in
the
camper
case
which
i
don't
think
we
cite
it,
it's
an
early
federal
case,
but
in
that,
he
concluded
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
constitution
and
the
patent
laws
go,
that
the
words
are
used
synonymously.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
i
know.
even
the
treasure
department
apparently
recognizes
that
drugs
can
come
within
the
subparagraph
for
it
has
settled
the
claim
involving
an
antibiotic
in
one
of
searle's
competitors.
and
then
as
this
very
record
show
the
internal
revenue
examining
officer
in
this
case
conceded
that
at
least
dramamine
constituted
a
discovery
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term.
searle
is
of
course
not
claiming
that
every
patented
drug
is
a
discovery,
but
only
that
the
rare
pioneer
or
breakthrough
drugs
constitute
discoveries.
the
same
is
true
with
polaroid
and
its
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
because
we
don't
think
that
the
statute
was
meant
to
apply
to
mere
improvements
--
mere
improvements,
which
just
grow
out
of
research
and
development.
they're
not
really
truly
discoveries
their
mere
improvements
are
never
referred
to
as
discoveries.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
we're
not
claiming
that
the
word
discovery
applies
to
all
product
and
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
well
i
think,
it's
the
same
on
--
it
grows
out
of
the
patent
law
actually
as
was
discussed
by
chief
justice
taft
in
his
idaho
process
case.
he
said
that
the
court
had
differing
attitudes
toward
genuine
discoveries
and
slight
improvements.
in
other
words,
they've
often
had
to
draw
the
line
between
genuine
discoveries
and
mere
improvements.
you
wouldn't
have
anything
really
abnormal,
if
it
was
a
mere
improvement.
it
couldn't
possibly
qualify.
it
would
just
be
research
and
development.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
a
pioneer
patent,
yes
not
an
improvement
patent.
it
would
have
to
be
something
startling
as
mr.
isaac
barnett
will
doubtless
tell
you
about
this
polaroid
camera
when
his
case
is
reached.
that
we
weren't
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
these
two
drugs
were
of
that
magnitude,
that's
what
we
would
like
to
--
enable
to
do
in
the
district
court.
in
the
--
in
administering
the
same
provision
under
the
world
war
ii
act,
the
tax
court
seemed
to
reflect
the
same
distinction
between
genuine
discoveries
or
mere
improvements.
in
the
ideal
mcculloch
case,
which
is
mentioned
in
our
brief,
where
the
taxpayer
was
denied
relief,
where
it
had
merely
improved
its
vacuum
tubes.
our
point
is
that
discovery
should
be
given
its
ordinary
meaning
here,
because
congress
in
our
opinion
has
not
specified
any
other
meaning.
one
such
example
of
this
rule,
in
this
court
is
the
avery
versus
commissioner
in
292
u.s.,
where
you
were
confronted
with
the
meaning
for
the
word,
received.
and
the
court
said
congress
hadn't
shown
any
other
meaning
that
should
be
given
to
receive,
so
it
was
given
its
normal
meaning
and
dividends
were
held
received
in
the
year
in
which
they
actually
were
received.
the
legislative
history,
which
is
to
be
discussed
by
mr.
isaac
barnett
for
polaroid,
also
shows
that
congress
intended
no
restrictive
meaning.
because
of
time
annotations,
i
won't
be
able
to
go
into
the
legislative
history
except
to
state
that
in
fact
the
only
link
between
section
456
and
natural
resources
in
the
1950
congressional
debates
or
hearings
or
committee
reports,
was
one
remark
by
a
representative
of
the
mining
industry
quoted
at
page
70
of
the
government's
brief.
the
brief
significantly
omits
the
next
sentence
which
in
effect
states,
“we,
the
mining
industry
probably
won't
need
section
456
for
ourselves,
but
it
is
a
good
idea
for
other
industries.”
the
government
has
collected
a
great
many
statutes
in
its
principal
brief
and
appendix
to
show
that
discovery
has
a
narrow
mineral
meaning
here,
but
unlike
the
headings
and
text
of
all
those
statutes,
neither
section
456
nor
section
721
its
precursor,
contains
any
heading
or
text
showing
their
applicability
was
confined
to
the
natural
resources
industry.
the
same
was
really
true
on
analysis
we
believe,
for
the
internal
content
of
this
statute.
the
language
used
in
subparagraph
(b)
is
exploration,
discovery
or
prospecting,
or
any
combination
of
the
foregoing.
each
word
then
is
given
an
independent
significance,
whereas
the
government
urges
that
discovery
is
covered
only
when
in
combination
with
exploration
and
prospecting
in
mining
operations.
in
other
words,
when
congress
intended
to
limit
discovery
to
no
resources,
it
has
always
so
specified
and
we've
given
many
examples
and
so
as
polaroid
in
its
brief.
the
main
ground
for
the
contrary
opinion
by
the
first
circuit
was
the
application
of
the
maxim
noscitur
a
sociis.
well
in
accordance
with
many
text
writers
on
the
subject
of
statutory
construction
such
as
sutherland,
this
court
has
often
refused
to
apply
the
maxim.
in
the
russell
company
case
for
example
in
261
u.s.
that
company
argued
that
the
word,
“contract”
in
a
statute,
had
to
be
limited
to
private
contracts
because
of
it's
word
association,
with
the
word,
requisition.
well,
the
court
included
government
contracts.
and
likewise
in
the
stockholms
enskilda
bank
case
in
293
u.
s.,
the
taxpayer
argued
that
the
word,
“obligations”
must
because
of
its
word,
association
be
confined
to
notes
and
bonds.
again,
this
court
refused
to
consider
the
adjacent
words.
as
in
both
those
cases
then,
the
noscitur
maxim
should
not
be
found
to
restrict
the
ordinary
meaning
of
discovery,
specially
since
the
application
of
section
456
to
a
discovery
of
this
type,
does
inform
that
the
basic
purpose
of
congress
to
give
relief
to
have
normal
income
which
is
attributable
in
part
to
prior
years.
to
our
knowledge,
the
noscitur
maxim
has
never
been
used
to
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
government
has
cited
no
cases
in
support
of
applying
the
maxim
here.
the
only
case
cited
by
the
first
circuit
in
favor
of
applying
the
maxim
here
was
an
1877
case,
in
which
its
application
was
in
accord
with
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute,
but
here
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute
would
not
be
so
satisfied.
if
you
aren't
going
to
apply
the
noscitur
maxim,
you
have
to
look
anyway
at
the
phrase
as
it
was
immediately
derived
in
section
721
of
the
world
war
ii
act.
that's
where
this
phrase
directly
came
from.
and
there
it
is
defined
as
covering
both
income
resulting
from
exploration,
discovery,
prospecting,
research
or
development
of
tangible
property,
patents,
formulae
or
processes
or
any
combination
of
the
foregoing.
so
that
applying
the
maxim,
in
the
setting
shows
that
discovery
was
not
used
only
in
the
mineral
sense.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
yes,
but
you
have
to
see
where
the
phrase
was
derived
from.
it
was
derived
there
and
it's
obvious
that
upon
--
applying
the
maxim
there,
it
could've
been
used
in
the
mineral
sense
and
just
cutting
out
those
other
words,
then
suddenly
turns,
it
changed
the
meaning
of
discovery.
exploration
is
not
confined
to
natural
resources
either.
its
common
meaning
is
to
seek
for
or
after
or
to
examine
and
in
the
keystone
brass
works,
the
tax
court
referred
to
keystone's
exploration
in
developing
new
bushings.
in
other
words,
the
term
was
there
used
in
a
non-mineral
sense,
in
the
sense
of
preliminary
investigation.
the
government
and
the
district
court
relies
specially
on
the
elimination
of
the
words
research
and
development
from
section
721.
and
the
proposed
regulation
provided
for
no
relief
whatever,
if
research
and
development
were
involved,
that
is
true.
but
that
regulation
was
abandoned
after
protest
in
favor
of
the
present
regulation
which
takes
the
exact
opposite
position
and
states
that
section
456
is
applicable
to
research
and
development
income
if
the
income
is
otherwise
properly
includable
within
the
class
of
income
to
which
the
section
is
applicable,
thus,
of
course,
including
discovery
income
or
income
under
the
omnibus.
congress
has
nowhere
stated
the
products
arising
out
of
research
and
development
cannot
constitute
discoveries
and
the
regulation
is
finally
adopted,
so
permits.
in
other
words,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
the
removal
of
the
words,
research
and
development,
was
meant
to
confine
the
discovery
language
to
the
mining
industry.
speaking
of
loopholes
as
mr.
barnett
did
a
few
minutes
ago,
researchers
of
course,
have
wider
concept
in
discovery
and
although
the
world
war
ii
act's
inclusion
of
those
phrases
supposedly
threatened
to
create
a
loophole
no
such
problem
is
presented
by
genuine
discovery,
which
is
a
rare
phenomenon.
even
under
section
721,
recoveries
were
modest
so
that
any
loophole
was
at
best
potential.
in
the
light
of
the
experience
of
the
cases
under
the
world
war
ii
act,
the
government's
claim
is
unwarranted
that
millions
of
dollars
would
be
jeopardized
by
affirming
the
holding
below.
after
all
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired,
this
particular
statute
was
repealed
in
1953,
and
the
regulations
themselves
have
very
rigorous
test
so
that
there
are
ample
safeguards
for
any
so-called
rate
on
the
treasury.
as
to
discoveries,
we
think
there
need
to
be
no
administrative
difficulties
for
income
from
the
new
product
can
be
specifically
identified
and
segregated
as
it
was
here.
consequently,
the
reasons
for
eliminating
research
and
development
do
not
exist
with
respect
to
a
discovery.
the
petitioners
claim
that
discovery
must
not
be
interpreted
and
include
patentable
discoveries,
but
fear
of
overlapping
subparagraph
(c),
but
this
assumes
that
the
two
paragraphs
are
mutually
exclusive,
they
were
not.
the
draftsmen
understood
that
income
might
be
quoting
the
draftsmen,
classified
and
more
than
one
of
such
paragraph
--
subparagraphs.
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
so
states,
in
which
case,
the
income
is
supposed
to
be
classified
under
the
one
which
the
taxpayer
irrevocably
elects.
in
construing
the
statute,
of
course,
the
purpose
of
the
statute
looms
very
large
and
the
main
object
of
this
statute
was
the
tax
benefits
attributed
to
the
large
military
budget
and
the
wartime
economy.
neither
those
factors
were
involved
with
respect
to
searle's
or
polaroid's
products.
section
456
was
enacted
to
give
relief
whereas
here,
the
profits
are
not
attributable
to
military
spending
or
the
wartime
economy.
as
the
tax
court
stated
in
the
ramsey
accessories
case,
congress
wanted
these
relief
provisions
to
be
applied
sympathetically.
the
house
report
which
was
approved
by
the
senate
finance
committee
so
states,
the
house
report
146,
the
report
states,
“equitable
considerations
demand
that
every
reasonable
be
--
precaution
be
taken
to
prevent
unfair
application
of
the
tax
in
abnormal
cases.”
the
weight
of
the
burden
imposed
carries
with
it
at
the
commensurate
need
for
restricting
its
application
to
the
cases
for
which
it
was
designed.
years
of
effort
go
into
a
discovery
and
its
competitive
advantage
that
will
last
on
the
short
time
and
therefore,
it's
certainly
within
the
spirit
of
section
456
to
afford
relief
here.
the
discovery
of
minerals
and
the
like
was
no
more
deserving
of
relief
legislation
than
the
discovery
of
vital
importance
to
the
health
of
millions
of
persons.
and
there
is
no
intention
on
it
at
all
of
congress
to
confine
subparagraph
(b)
to
the
mining
industry.
the
mining
industry
was
already
well
taken
care
of
in
many
other
provisions
of
the
code
including
certain
sections
of
this
very
statute.
the
essence
of
section
456
is
to
recognize
the
unfairness
of
bunching
for
heavy
taxation
in
one
year
discovery
income
which
is
in
fact,
attributable
to
several
years.
congress
intended
that
abnormal
income
from
discovery,
if
it
can
be
shown
to
be
attributable
to
other
years,
should
be
taxed
accordingly.
all
searle
wants
is
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
income,
in
fact,
was
attributable
to
other
years
and
it's
consequently
entitled
to
relief
under
section
456.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
solution
of
this
problem,
the
district
court's
order
simplified
it
and
said
he
would
only
pass
on
whether
this
could
fit
within
subparagraph
(b),
the
discovery
provision
or
within
the
omnibus
clause
which
i'm
now
about
to
discuss.
our
second
point
and
then
it
is
an
equally
important
point
is
that
searle's
and
polaroid's
income
in
the
alternative,
constituted
a
special
class
of
abnormal
income
under
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute.
that's
a
very
short
sentence.
it
appears
at
the
middle
of
page
3
of
our
brief,
the
blue
brief
and
states
only,
“the
classification
of
income
of
any
class
not
described
in
subparagraphs
(a)
to
(d),
inclusive,
shall
be
subject
to
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary.”
one
has
to
turn
to
the
house
report
on
the
world
war
ii
statute
to
see
what
the
reason
was
for
including
an
omnibus
clause.
and
the
same
house
report
number
146
that
i
read
from
a
few
minutes
ago
gives
the
reason.
it
is
stated
there
that
“experience
with
excess
profits
taxes
both
in
the
u.s.
and
abroad,
has
demonstrated
conclusively
that
relief
in
abnormal
cases
cannot
be
predicated
on
specific
instances
foreseeable
at
anytime.
the
unusual
cases
that
are
certain
to
arise
are
so
diverse
in
character
and
unpredictable
that
relief
provisions
couched
in
other
than
general
and
flexible
terms
are
certain
to
prove
inadequate
and
that
is
why
this
catchall
clause
or
omnibus
clause
was
inserted.
the
report
goes
on
to
state
that
existing
law
provides
for
adjustment
with
respect
to
six
specific
classes
and
the
instant
statute
was
reduced
to
four,
received
during
the
taxable
year
subject
to
the
excess
profits
tax.
these
specific
items
were
allowed
to
be
spread
over
the
years
to
which
they're
actually
attributable.
your
committee
feels
that
the
relief
afforded
by
this
provision
should
not
be
limited
to
these
specific
items,
but
should
be
available
also
with
respect
to
any
item
of
abnormal
income
as
such
income
is
defined
in
the
bill.
and
then
little
later,
enter
the
--
detailed
discussions
of
the
bill,
they
go
on
to
the
same
effect
to
say
that
since
the
types
of
abnormal
income
cannot
be
predicted
in
advance,
you
can
only
grant
adequate
relief
by
extending
the
scope
of
this
section
and
that's
why
this
last
sentence
was
added.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
he
has
never
done
so,
mr.
justice
harlan,
instead
by
regulations.
he's
given
that
right
to
the
taxpayers
since
1944.
he
said
to
the
taxpayer
may
group
income
in
such
other
classes,
but
they
have
to
be
similar
classes.
they
have
to
be
reasonable
and
appropriate.
in
other
words,
the
regulation
sets
up
--
sets
up
three
standards.
a
taxpayer
under
this
omnibus
clause
is
permitted
the
group
income
in
similar
classes,
as
those
specified
in
paragraphs
(a)
to
(d)
as
are
reasonable
and
appropriate
and
that
is
shown
at
the
regulation
at
the
bottom
of
page
3
of
our
brief.
“similar”
of
course,
does
not
mean
identical
or
this
omnibus
clause
would
become
entirely
meaningless.
again,
one
has
to
resort
to
a
dictionary
definition
and
“similar”
according
to
webster
means,
somewhat
alike.
certainly,
a
discovery
of
a
new
product
is
similar
or
somewhat
alike
to
the
discovery
even
of
a
new
mine,
except
that
the
type
of
business
is
different.
in
other
words,
the
class
of
income
from
newly
discovered
products
is
certainly
similar
to,
if
not
identical
with
the
class
of
discovery
mentioned
in
subparagraph
(b).
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
the
tax
--
yes
the
tax
court
at
least,
has.
the
commissioner
in
our
case
is
not
giving
us
the
reason
that
research
and
development
were
involved,
but
as
you
can
see
from
the
last
sentence
of
that
regulation
though
that
was
an
erroneous
reason
because
--
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
in
the
premier
products
case,
not
in
our
brief,
again,
i
found
it
preparing
for
today,
2
b.t.a.
445,
the
catchall
is
applied
to
insurance
proceeds.
and
then
in
several
other
cases
after
that,
such
as
the
wb
knight
case,
which
is
in
our
brief
in
6
b.t.a.
519,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
statute
applies
to
not
only
the
lettered
classes
but
also
to
the
omnibus
or
the
catchall
class.
“similar,”
under
the
regulation
in
the
setting,
means
that
if
a
taxpayer
classifies
separately
a
readily
identifiable
segment
of
income,
differing
from
its
other
products
and
attributed
to
--
attributable
to
prior
years,
such
a
class
would
be
similar
to
the
classes
specified
and
should
qualify
for
relief,
if
the
other
test
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation
is
satisfied.
yet,
the
district
court
by
its
summary
judgment
would
not
permit
searle
to
meet
the
three
tests
established
in
the
regulation.
so
it
should
not
have
been
cut
off
by
summary
judgment
from
showing
that
it
was
reasonable
and
appropriate
for
it
to
group
its
income
from
dramamine
and
banthine
in
a
separate
class.
of
all
searle's
drugs,
these
were
the
only
two
that
were
completely
new
in
concept
and
successfully
performed
in
options
and
not
previously
performed
by
earlier
pharmaceutical
products.
none
of
the
other
drugs
marketed
by
searle
was
truly
new.
in
fact,
this
was
recognized
by
the
government
itself
in
1955
when
it
rejected
searle's
claim
for
refund
of
world
war
ii
excess
profits
taxes,
because
at
that
time,
searle
had
no
new
products
as
it's
shown
at
pages
29
to
38
of
the
record.
at
the
trial,
searle
would
also
to
show
that
the
income
from
these
two
drugs
was
attributable
to
prior
years
under
section
456
(b)
and
was
abnormal
in
amount
between
the
requirements
of
section
456
(a)
(1).
thus,
it
would
be
entirely
immaterial
whether
these
drugs
were
produced
as
abnormal
or
routine
part
of
searle's
business,
which
was
the
only
test
used
by
the
commissioner.
instead
it's
enough
if
it's
abnormal
in
amount.
what
does
the
government
say
about
the
omnibus
clause?
in
its
reply
brief,
it
makes
three
points.
first
of
all,
it
states
that
it
was
inadvertently
left
in
the
statute.
well
that
is
not
true,
because
the
legislative
history
in
1950
shows
that
the
house
conferees
insisted
that
it
be
put
back
in
the
statute
after
the
senate
left
it
out.
the
staff
reported
the
joint
committee
on
internal
revenue's
taxation
in
1950,
acknowledged
that
the
omnibus
clause
give
relief
to
a
fifth
class,
namely,
quoting
five,
“income
of
other
classes
permitted
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary.”
senator
george
made
a
similar
statement
on
the
senate
floor,
but
this
gave
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
the
authority
to
prescribe
classifications
in
addition
to
those
prescribed
in
the
bill.
in
other
words,
it
could
have
been
inadvertent.
the
government
also
claims
that
the
sentence
can
have
no
operative
effect
because
the
definition
section,
section
456
(a)
(1),
is
confined
to
income
described
in
paragraph
(2).
well
that
gives
a
very
narrow
meaning
to
the
word,
described.
instead
described
applies
not
only
to
the
four
classes
specified
in
subparagraph
(2)
but
also,
of
course,
to
the
omnibus
classification.
that's
part
of
subparagraph
(2)
as
well.
if
you
gave
the
narrow
meaning
to
describe
that
the
government
gives
to
it,
the
catchall
or
omnibus
clause
would
have
no
effect
at
all,
despite
the
fact
that
the
house
put
it
back
for
the
very
same
reasons
that
was
put
in
the
world
war
ii
act,
namely,
that
would
have
been
unfair
without
it.
finally,
the
government
claims
that
the
last
sentence
of
the
regulation
under
this
omnibus
clause
means
that
income
involving
research
is
excluded
unless
it
qualifies
under
one
of
the
four
classes
listed,
namely,
a,
b,
c,
or
d,
but
the
regulation
does
not
so
state
at
all.
the
last
sentence
of
the
regulation
applies
to
any
class
of
income
to
which
the
principle
of
section
456
and
i'm
quoting
the
statute
of
the
regulation,
“is
applicable”.
in
other
words,
the
last
sentence,
the
regulation
applies
to
any
class
a
through
d
or
one
selected
by
the
taxpayer
pursuant
to
the
last
sentence
of
456
(a)
(2)
in
the
regulations.
the
reason
for
eliminating
relief
to
research
and
development
income
also
does
not
extend
the
income
within
the
meaning
of
the
last
sentence
for
income
is
not
entitled
to
relief
under
that
sentence
unless
the
three
tests
of
the
regulations
are
met.
in
other
words,
you
have
to
show
that
it's
similar,
reasonable
and
appropriate.
also
you
have
to
show
that
the
income
is
attributable
to
prior
years
under
section
456
(b).
thus,
is
it
foolish
to
assert
that
if
we
prevail
income
abnormal
in
amount
would
automatically
and
suddenly
qualified
for
relief,
instead
the
attribution
test
at
456
(b)
has
to
be
met,
the
three
tests
of
the
regulation
under
the
omnibus
clause
have
to
be
met
and
many
other
requirements
of
the
very
rigorous
regulations
would
still
have
to
be
satisfied.
the
district
court's
holding
that
income
attributable
with
recent
surge
has
ipso
facto
excluded
under
section
456,
was
certainly
erroneous
and
in
conclusion,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
and
searle
should
be
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
dramamine
and
banthine
were
discoveries
within
subparagraph
(b)
or
if
they
were
not,
that
the
income
was
within
the
omnibus
sentence,
the
last
sentence
of
the
section
and
the
regulations
there
under.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
the
only
reason
given,
mr.
justice
harlan
in
denying
our
claim
was
that
if
the
drugs
were
produced
as
a
normal
or
routine
part
of
searle's
business,
but
that
is
patently
wrong
because
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
--
and
as
mr.
barnett
stated
earlier,
the
definition
section,
section
456
(a)
(1)
applies
to
income
whether
it
is
abnormal
in
kind
or
abnormal
in
amount.
our
income
was
abnormal
in
amount.
so
the
reason
given
for
not
committing
the
catchall
clause
to
apply
just
was
an
invalid
reason.
mr.
walter
j.
cummings,
jr.
because
the
--
whether
it's
abnormal
in
kind
doesn't
matter,
but
it
satisfies
the
second
test
of
the
statute
which
is
quoting
from
page
2.
“if
the
taxpayer
normally
derives
income
of
such
class,
but
the
amount
of
such
income
of
such
class
includable
in
the
gross
income
taxable
year
is
an
excess
of
115%
per
annum.”
we
can
satisfy
that
test,
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
would
like
to
do
so
in
the
district
court.
our
complaint
sets
out
mathematically
why
we
can
meet
the
abnormal
in
amount
test.
thank
you.
