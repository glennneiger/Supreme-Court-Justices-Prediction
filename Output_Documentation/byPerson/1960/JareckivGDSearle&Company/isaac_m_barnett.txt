mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
my
secretary
tells
me
that
no
matter
how
this
case
is
decided,
mr.
barnett
will
win.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
polaroid's
income
from
this
--
from
two
scientific
discoveries
is
entitled
to
relief
as
abnormal
income
under
section
456
(a)
(2)
of
the
korean
war
excess
profits
tax
laws.
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit,
while
acknowledging
that
these
discoveries
were
revolutionary
discoveries
held
that
no
scientific
discovery
can
qualify
for
relief
under
section
456
and
decided
against
polaroid.
our
contentions
are
similar
to
those
advanced
in
the
searle
case.
first
that
polaroid's
income
from
its
scientific
discoveries
falls
squarely
within
the
class
of
income
described
in
456
(a)
(2)
(b)
as
income
resulting
from
discovery;
456
(a)
(2)
(b)
as
--
as
was
explained
in
the
prior
argument,
reads
income
resulting
from
exploration,
discovery
or
prospecting
or
any
combination
of
the
foregoing
extending
over
a
period
of
12
months.
secondly,
if
it
does
not,
if
it's
not
entitled
to
come
under
(b),
that
such
income
was
entitled
to
classification
under
the
last
sentence
of
456
(a)
(2),
which
provides
for
additional
classifications
by
the
secretary.
and
to
get
that
again
before
your
honors,
that
last
sentence
reads,
“the
classification
of
income
of
any
class
not
described
in
subparagraphs
(a)
to
(d)
inclusive,
shall
be
subject
to
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary.”
we
contend
further
that
a
proper
interpretation
of
the
treasury
regulations
issued
to
implement
this
last
sentence
that
under
such
an
interpretation,
polaroid's
income
qualified
for
relief.
now
the
two
scientific
discoveries
that
were
involved
in
this
case,
are
the
polaroid
land
process
and
the
polaroid
3-d
synthetic
polarizer.
the
polaroid
land
process
consisting
of
the
polaroid
land
camera
and
film
is
a
photographic
system
in
which
by
one
step
dry
processing,
the
developing
and
printing
of
the
picture
take
place
simultaneously
within
the
camera,
enabling
the
user
to
obtain
a
finished
dry
positive
print
directly
from
the
camera
within
60
seconds.
prior
to
the
conception
of
the
process,
no
photographic
process
existed
whereby
the
picture
was
taken,
the
negative
developed
and
a
positive
print
obtained
directly
from
the
camera
by
a
one-step
dry
process.
the
3-d
synthetic
polarizer
is
the
light
polarizing
material
incorporated
in
the
viewers,
used
by
the
audience
in
the
viewing
of
three
dimensional
motion
pictures
to
create
the
illusion
of
three
dimensions
and
the
exhibition
of
three
dimensional
motion
pictures,
could
not
have
been
undertaken
without
it.
that
the
--
our
case
differs
with
the
searle
case
in
that,
we
already
have
had
the
trial.
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
tax
court
establish
that
these
discoveries
were
revolutionary
scientific
discoveries
creating
new
odds
and
that
the
incoming
question
resulted
solely
and
entirely
from
the
discoveries.
we
differ
from
the
searle
case
in
another
respect.
we
have
a
stipulation
in
our
case,
in
which
the
government
and
polaroid
have
agreed
in
the
event
that
this
case
is
decided
favorably
to
polaroid,
upon
the
amounts
of
net
abnormal
income
arising
from
the
discoveries
and
upon
the
portions
thereof
to
be
attributed
to
prior
years.
so
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
we
should
win
here,
we
do
not
have
to
go
back.
we
have
a
--
findings
of
fact
on
--
on
the
facts
that
we
have
revolutionary
basic
discoveries
and
we
also
have
a
stipulation
with
respect
to
the
mathematical
answers
under
section
456.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
the
way
this
is
construed
under
456,
i
think
mr.
--
you,
yourself,
your
honor
in
the
recent
--
in
your
recent
convertible
top
case,
where
there's
an
indication
that
the
word,
discoveries
couldn't
report
to
the
type
of
patent
that
was
involved
there.
i
think
that
you'll
find
it
in
the
patent
laws,
there
is
a
distinction
--
in
the
cases
involving
patented
inventions,
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
basic
patent
which
advances
the
odd
substantially
and
one
which
maybe
entitled
a
patent,
but
it's
merely
an
insignificant
improvement.
now
the
court
below
seems
to
think
there
would
be
a
large
administrative
problem
connected
with
determining
which
is
significant
and
which
isn't.
it
might
be
a
question,
but
--
and
it
can't
very
easily
be
answered
in
the
abstract,
but
again,
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
hear
the
facts
with
respect
to
any
particular
invention,
you
know
whether
it's
significant
or
not.
and
in
our
case,
despite
the
fact
that
we
--
they've
decided
against
us,
both
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
were
revolutionary
inventions.
they
thought
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
that
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
well,
i
just
want
to
say,
your
honor,
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
problem
might
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
it
might
be,
for
example
like
was
before
you
in
an
entirely
different
field
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
you
can't
state
in
the
abstract,
but
once
you
see
the
facts,
you
know
whether
what
the
answer
is
one
way
or
the
other.
a
revolutionary
invention
creates
tremendous
surprise
and
you
find
through
the
lay
literature,
through
the
scientific
literatures,
also
lots
of
indications
as
to
whether
it
is
recognized
as
revolutionary
or
not.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
i
think
your
honor
would
have
to
determine
as
to
--
there
would
--
there
would
have
to
be
a
determination
as
to
whether
there
is
a
significant
invention
involved
in
the
--
in
the
process
or
the
--
or
the
product.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
well,
yes,
a
flash
of
genius
your
honor,
but
there
could
be
different
flashes
of
genius.
[laughter]
and
that
--
my
-
my
namesake
in
making
this
argument
has
so
paneled
principal
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
government
in
his
brief
so
far
which
had
--
has
been
the
basic
argument
that
before
these
words,
exploration
discovery
of
prospecting
were
used
in
section
721
(a)
to
(c)
of
the
second
world
war
act
from
which
our
section,
456
(a)
(2)
(b)
is
derived,
the
words
have
become
in
the
internal
revenue
laws,
words
of
odd
applicable
only
to
natural
resources.
that's
their
basic
argument
and
we
think
that's
based
on
an
improper
analysis
of
the
legislative
history.
and
in
view
of
the
time
involved,
i'd
like
to
confine
most
of
my
argument
of
that
legislative
history.
in
support
of
it
--
of
its
contention,
the
government
has
called
attention
to
two
statutory
provisions.
both
are
resonating
in
the
revenue
act
of
1918.
section
337,
which
established
a
ceiling
on
the
rate
of
tax
in
the
case
of,
“this
is
from
the
statute,”
“a
bona
fide
sale
of
a
mine,
oil
or
gas
well,
that's
right
in
the
statute,”
the
principle
value
of
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
prospecting
or
exploration
and
discovery
work
and
the
other
section
to
which
they
refer
is
section
234
(a)
(9)
of
the
1918
act,
which
in
providing
for
a
depletion
allowance
stated
in
the
case
of
mines,
oil
or
gas
wells
discovered
after
march
1,
1913,
the
allowance
was
to
be
based
on
the
value
at
the
date
of
the
discovery.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
we
closed
yesterday,
i
pointed
out
that
the
government
in
contending
that
these
were
words
of
arts
applicable
only
to
natural
resources
relied
on
two
sections
of
the
1918
law;
one,
in
which
the
words
prospecting,
exploration,
and
discovery
were
used
and
the
other
in
which
the
word
discovery
was
used.
the
main
emphasis
of
the
government
has
been
on
section
337
which
the
government
asserts
was
the
original
source
of
section
721
(a)
(2)
(c)
and
section
456
(a)
(2)
(b).
we
agree
that
in
attempting
to
find
the
intent
underlying
456
(a)
(2)
(b),
it
is
helpful
to
go
back
to
the
revenue
act
of
1918
where
we
believe
that
the
government
has
gone
back
to
the
wrong
section.
section
456
is
a
section
designed
to
give
relief
for
abnormal
income
in
an
excess
profits
tax
year.
the
1918
act
also
had
this
section
giving
relief
for
abnormalities
and
income
and
an
excess
profits
tax
year,
and
that
with
section
327
(d),
which
your
honors
will
find
on
page
25
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petitioner's
brief.
section
327
(d)
provided
that
where
owing
to
abnormal
conditions
affecting
the
capital
or
income
of
the
corporation,
the
tax
would
work
in
exceptional
hardship
upon
the
corporation
evidenced
by
a
gross
disproportion
between
the
tax
computed
without
benefit
of
that
section
and
the
tax
computed
by
reference
to
the
representative
corporations
referred
to
in
section
328.
the
tax
was
to
be
determined
as
provided
in
section
328
and
under
328,
an
adjustment
of
the
tax
was
made
to
bring
it
into
line
with
the
tax
imposed
upon
representative
corporations
in
the
same
industry.
to
understand
just
what
were
the
abnormal
conditions
referred
to
in
327
(d),
the
history
of
this
section
is
illuminating
and
we
believe
particularly
significant
in
construing
section
456
(a)
(2)
(b).
as
originally
introduced
in
the
house,
section
327
mentioned
three
abnormal
conditions.
in
the
senate,
the
bill
was
considerably
expanded
to
include
a
number
of
additional
abnormal
conditions
and
one
of
them
is
particularly
pertinent.
i'm
referring
to
section
327
(e)
(3)
(b)
of
the
senate
bill
which
your
honors
will
find
printed
on
pages
three
and
four
on
petitioner's
reply
brief.
that
subsection
in
the
senate
amendment
listed
as
an
abnormal
condition,
the
situation
where
the
net
income
for
the
taxable
year
is
abnormally
high
due
to
the
realization
in
one
year
of
extraordinary
gains
or
profits
derived
from
the
sale
of
property,
the
principal
value
of
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
prospecting
or
exploration
and
discovery
work.
and
you
will
note
your
honor
that
there's
no
mention
as
there
was
in
337,
specifically
in
the
case
of
mines,
oils
or
gas
wells.
now
in
conference,
the
language
of
section
327
was
changed
to
the
form
in
which
it
was
primarily
enacted,
but
the
language
changes
were
intended
only
to
consolidate
into
one
general
classification,
all
of
the
various
classes
of
abnormal
conditions
listed
in
the
senate
amendment
and
not
to
eliminate
any
of
them.
this
intention
to
amalgamate
and
not
to
eliminate
is
confirmed
by
the
conference
committee
report
by
statements
of
various
senators
on
the
senate
floor
and
by
a
ruling
of
the
solicitor
of
internal
revenue
to
which
we
have
referred
in
our
brief.
the
solicitor
of
internal
revenue
had
the
decision,
the
question
of
whether
a
manufacturing
company
which
had
spent
substantial
sums
and
to
use
his
words,
experimental
and
discovery
work
in
developing
a
secret
formula
which
had
given
the
company
a
virtual
monopoly
which
sums
have
not
been
capitalized,
was
entitled
to
relief
under
section
327.
he
stated
that
in
order
to
learn
just
what
congress
intended
by
the
words
abnormal
conditions
in
section
327
(d),
it
was
necessary
to
resort
to
the
list
of
abnormal
conditions
contained
in
the
senate
version
of
that
section
and
he
ruled
that
such
a
company
was
entitled
to
relief
under
section
327.
the
use
of
the
words
experimental
and
discovery
work
shows
that
he
did
not
regard
those
words
as
limited
only
to
the
extractive
industries.
he
had
to
find
abnormal
condition
under
the
law.
in
order
to
qualify
it
for
relief
he
found
it
in
the
section
to
which
i
have
referred,
which
refers
to
exploration,
discovery
and
prospecting.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
same
time
as
the
senate
was
amending
section
327,
it
introduced
them
to
the
bill
by
way
of
amendment
section
337
upon
which
the
government
relied.
this
time
coincidence
enables
us
to
make
a
pertinent
comparison
between
these
two
sections.
section
337
was
admittedly
a
section
designed
to
give
relief
solely
to
mines,
oils
and
gas
wells.
and
the
senate
left
no
doubt
as
to
that
intention
by
saying
so
in
so
many
words.
in
both
sections
explicitly,
it
says
in
the
case
of
mines,
oil
or
gas
wells.
had
the
senate
had
similar
intent
to
section
327,
it
would
be
expected
that
it
would
have
shown
it
in
similar
fashion,
but
it
did
not
do
this
in
section
327.
on
the
contrary,
it
used
the
general
word
property
in
listing
as
an
abnormal
condition,
extraordinary
gains
or
profits
derived
from
the
sale
of
property,
the
principal
value
of
which
has
been
demonstrated
by
exploration
or
discovery
work.
had
the
senate
the
intent
of
limiting
the
provision
in
327,
as
it
had
done
in
337,
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
draftsmen
to
have
provided
in
the
case
of
mines,
oil
or
gas
wells
extraordinary
gains
or
profits
derived
from
the
sale
and
so
forth.
that
the
words
prospecting
or
exploration
and
discovery
work
as
used
in
the
senate's
version
of
327
were
understood
to
have
general
meaning
applicable
to
oil
corporations
and
oil
industries,
it's
not
only
confirmed
by
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
of
internal
revenue
to
which
i
have
referred,
but
also
by
the
action
of
the
conference
committee
in
merging
all
the
classes
of
the
senate
amendment
into
one
general
classification.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
1918.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
that
these
words
had
reference
only
to
the
operations
of
the
extractive
industries,
they
could
not
have
been
so
merged.
moreover,
if
one
looks
at
the
senate
committee
report
which
accompanied
section
337
and
your
honors
will
find
that
printed
on
page
25
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
searle
case,
that
section
has
headed
gains
derived
from
prospecting,
exploration,
or
discovery
and
one
notes
that
the
senate
saw
fit
in
addition
to
giving
its
reasons
for
the
enactment
of
section
337,
to
call
attention
in
that
subdivision
to
the
increased
depletion
allowance
allowed
under
section
234
(a)
(9).
no
reference
whatever
was
made
to
section
327.
and
here
is
a
situation
where
they
just
got
through
amending
327,
and
if
it
deprived
only
to
the
extractive
industries,
it
would
have
been
expected
that
it
would
have
mentioned
it
under
this
heading
gains
derived
from
prospecting,
exploration,
or
discovery.
so,
that
under
the
1918
act,
we
have
history
to
the
effect
that
these
words
have
been
used
in
a
context
applicable
to
others
in
the
extractive
industries.
we
now
come
to
section
--
to
the
world
war
ii
law.
abnormalities
in
tax
year
income
were
covered
in
the
world
war
ii
law
in
section
721.
and
with
respect
to
such
abnormalities,
congress
introduced
a
new
concept
to
determine
abnormality
by
classes
of
income,
yet
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
in
establishing
the
class
of
income
described
in
721
(a)
(2)
(c),
which
was
income
resulting
from
exploration,
discovery,
prospecting,
research
or
development
of
tangible
property,
patents,
processes
or
formulae,
congress
was
not
unmindful
of
the
formal
of
provision
in
section
327
(d)
of
the
1918
act
and
of
the
history
of
that
section
and
how
it
was
interpreted.
in
fact
the
phrasing
of
section
721
of
the
original
act,
which
your
honors
will
find
printed
in
the

of
the
government's
reply
brief,
i
think
demonstrates
that
section
721
was
patterned
on
327
(d)
of
the
1918
act.
you
will
note
that
the
words
grossly
disproportionate
are
used,
instead
of
the
mathematical
formula
for
determining
abnormality
that
later
resolved
it.
these
are
the
same
words
that
were
used
in
section
327
(d),
but
whether
it
was
packing
on
the
1918
act
or
not,
i
submit
that
the
legislative
history
which
i
have
just
recounted,
demonstrates
that
the
words
exploration,
discovery
and
prospecting
had
not
become
words
of
art
referring
only
to
the
mining
industry.
it
is
also
clear
that
the
provisions
of
section
721
in
all
its
subdivisions
were
intended
to
apply
to
corporations
in
oil
industries
and
this
was
confirmed
by
the
statements
on
the
senate
floor
to
which
we
have
adverted
in
our
brief.
senator
george
was
asked
for
example
as
to
what
was
the
additional
benefit
to
the
mining
industry
and
he
replied
that
provision
was
helpful
not
only
to
a
mining
corporation,
it
was
helpful
to
any
type
of
corporation
and
i
might
add
that
applying
the
principle
of
noscitur
a
sociis
to
721
(a)
(2)
(c),
you
couldn't
come
up
with
any
common
denominator
that
the
words
apply
only
to
the
mining
industry.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
i
think
he
was,
your
honor.
now
section
721
(a)
(2)
(c)
was
much
broader
than
the
provisions
in
the
senate
version
of
327
of
the
1918
act.
there
was
added
to
the
concept
of
abnormal
income,
abnormal
income
resulting
from
research
or
development
of
tangible
property.
now,
the
word
"research"
is
a
very
broad
word.
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
only
laboratory
research.
we
speak
of
legal
research.
there
is
research
in
business,
in
marketing
methods,
in
manufacturing
costs,
and
various
analysis
and
surveys.
and
this
addition
which
was
added
in
the
9th
--
in
the
second
world
war
act
of
the
word
"research"
led
to
a
substantial
number
of
--
a
substantial
increase
in
the
applications
for
relief.
now
let
us
consider
section
456
(a)
(2)
(b)
in
the
light
of
this
legislative
history.
this
section,
according
to
the
committee
reports,
is
section
721
(a)
(2)
(c)
with
the
word
"research"
or
development
of
tangible
property
left
out.
now,
if
this
was
a
brand
new
section
that
was
originally
created
in
the
korean
war
then
maybe
the
principle
of
noscitur
a
sociis
may
conceivably
have
applications.
but
what
it
was,
was
a
derivation
of
an
old
section
and
to
find
out
what
the
meaning
of
these
words
were,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
old
section
and
certainly
the
principle
of
noscitur
a
sociis
doesn't
--
in
721
(a)
(2)
(c)
doesn't
result
in
the
holding
that
it
applies
only
to
the
natural
resource
industries.
unless
there
was
a
clear
indication
of
attempt
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
words
which
were
left
in,
in
456
(a)
(2)
(b)
by
taking
out
the
words
research
or
development,
the
words
exploration,
discovery
and
prospecting
continues
to
have
the
same
general
meaning
applicable
to
all
types
of
corporations,
as
they
had,
we
submit
in
section
721
(a)
(2)
(c)
and
before
that
in
327.
now
there
was
no
evidence
that
by
deleting
the
words
research
and
development,
congress
intended
to
change
the
meaning
of
the
words
it
retained
and
the
government
concedes
that
the
word
discovery
in
456
(a)
(2)
(b)
has
the
same
meaning
as
in
721
(a)
(2)
(c).
now,
congress
has
told
us
the
purpose
of
the
deletion
of
the
words
research
and
development
of
tangible
property.
it
was
to
plug
a
potential
loophole
found
to
exist
in
the
old
law.
now,
a
loophole
is
getting
something
to
which
you're
not
entitled,
getting
a
form
of
relief
to
which
you're
not
entitled.
now,
what
was
this
loophole?
we
venture
to
suggest
that
the
loophole
which
had
--
was
one
which
have
been
created
by
the
extension
of
qualification
of
relief
under
section
721
(a)
(2)
(c)
generally
to
research
or
development
of
tangible
property
which
had
not
in
and
of
itself
been
recognized
as
abnormal
condition
under
327
(d)
of
the
1918
act.
this
potential
loophole
stems
from
the
inability
in
certain
cases
arising
under
section
721
(a)
(2)
(c)
of
establishing
what
income,
if
any,
resulted
from
the
research
and
development.
it
had
the
company
that
had
a
product.
it
did
some
research
and
development
and
improved
the
product,
and
if
so,
the
improved
product,
you
couldn't
tell
what
demand
there
was
for
the
product
--
what
demand
there
would
have
been
from
the
product
during
that
year
even
if
that
hadn't
been
improved.
so,
it
was
impossible
to
separate
the
demand
for
the
basic
product
--
from
the
product
improved
by
the
alleged
research
and
development
and
that
was
the
potential
loophole
which
congress
sought
to
strike
to
--
to
--
to
plug.
and
if
that
potential
loophole
does
not
exist
though
in
the
case
of
a
discovery
of
a
new
basic
invention,
since
“but
for”
the
discovery,
there
would
have
been
no
income
at
all.
and
accordingly,
whatever
income
resulted
is
directly
traceable
to
the
discovery.
thus,
in
this
case,
the
tax
court
made
findings
of
fact
to
the
effect
that
polaroid's
income
from
the
polaroid
land
process
during
the
tax
year
resulted
entirely
from
its
capacity
to
produce
a
picture
in
a
minute.
if
this
process
had
not
made
an
instantaneous
positive
print,
this
is
the
finding,
there
would
have
been
no
commercial
demand
for
this
camera
or
photographic
fact
during
that
period.
now,
with
respect
to
the
other
discovery,
the
3-d
synthetic
polarizer,
the
tax
court
found
the
exhibition
of
3-d
motion
pictures
would
not
have
been
commercially
practicable,
had
petitioner's
synthetic
polarizers
were
not
been
available.
no,
not
infringing
material
for
this
practice
was
on
the
market.
so,
there
was
no
question
of
allocation.
this
is
brand
new.
all
the
income
proceeded
from
--
from
the
discovery.
it's
not
the
type
of
thing
that
mr.
barnett
mentioned
in
his
argument
like
giving
allowance
for
the
capital
you
have,
the
selling
organization
and
so
on.
those
things
are
involved
in
the
sale
of
oil
or
the
output
of
mines
just
as
much
is
they
are
involved
in
the
sale
of
a
camera
or
a
drug
and
so
forth
and
they
still
continue
to
--
to
be
factors.
it
have
to
be
taken
into
account
and
the
regulations
so
prescribe.
the
regulation
say,
the
present
regulation
say
that
you
can
attribute
to
prior
years
any
income
resulting
some
increased
demand
lessen
competition
and
so
forth.
so
that
it's
recognized
that
there
has
to
be
some
editing
of
the
income
based
upon
certain
other
factors.
in
addition
to
that,
as
your
honors
remember
i
said
yesterday,
we
have
a
stipulation
here
so
that
the
government
and
we
have
agreed
as
to
how
much
of
the
income
proceeded
from
the
--
from
these
discoveries.
now,
the
government
apparently
acknowledges
that
ours
is
a
type
of
case
which
considering
the
purpose
of
section
456
would
be
entitled
to
relief
but
it
answered
unfortunately,
we
are
one
of
the
meritorious
cases
which
was
sacrificed
in
the
interest
of
the
administrative
simplification.
we
hope
we
are
a
meritorious
case,
but
we
are
not
one
of
those
referred
to
in
the
committee
reports
as
having
to
be
sacrificed.
the
meritorious
cases
they
refer
to
were
cases
in
which
a
major
portion
of
the
income
could
have
come
from
the
improvement
which
resulted
from
the
research
and
development.
but
because
of
the
inability
to
separate
what
income
came
from
the
improvement
and
what
income
was
the
basic
--
came
from
the
basic
demand
for
the
product
that
was
the
type
of
the
case
which
had
to
be
sacrificed.
no
administrative
discretion
is
involved
in
determining
the
income
from
a
new
basic
discovery
and
congress
had
no
intention
we
submit
of
barring
such
a
case
from
relief.
in
other
words,
congress
indicated
intent,
plugged
a
loophole.
we
can
assume
that
it
intended
to
do
anything
more
than
--
than
what
was
necessary
to
plug
that
loophole.
and
if
congress
had
any
intent
of
eliminating
from
relief
all
industries
other
than
the
extractive
industries,
although
those
industries
got
relief
under
the
two
prior
excess
profits
tax
laws,
if
it
was
making
as
drastic
a
change
as
that
you
would
expect
that
it
would
have
said
something
in
its
committee
reports
in
that
connection,
but
it
said
nothing
like
it.
all
it
was
doing
was
to
plug
a
loophole
with
respect
to
certain
cases
involving
research
--
research
and
development.
and
i
might
add
that
the
word
discovery
does
not
necessarily
presuppose
research.
i
don't
imagine
that
einstein's
discovery
of
law
of
relativity
required
any
research
before
it.
you
could
have
discovery
of
a
flower
which
would
entitle
to
you
a
pattern
which
may
or
may
not
involve
some
--
some
research.
so
that
our
contention
is
if
you
--
if
you
have
to
read
these
committee
reports
carefully
that
the
--
the
committee
reports
indicate
that
--
that
they're
only
taking
out
of
the
law
what
--
what
was
necessary
to
plug
that
loophole
and
that
is
accomplished
by
taking
out
what
they
put
--
put
into
it
and
adding
general
research
in
721
which
hadn't
existed
in
1918
act.
now,
before
posing
this
point,
i
want
to
make
one
more
observation.
the
government
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
yeah,
we
do
your
honor
in
this
sense.
we
--
we
--
we
feel
that
it
has
to
be
an
invention
which
opened
up
a
new
field,
created
a
new
odd
because
that
is
a
discovery.
and
--
and
words,
there
--
there
are
minor
improvements
which
might
positively
entitle
you
a
patent
we
don't
regard
as
a
discovery.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
well,
your
honor,
at
least
justice
taft
referred
to
it
as
--
as
substantially
advancing
the
odds.
it
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
well,
not
--
not
necessarily
your
honor.
even
in
patent
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
well,
no.
even
in
patents
for
example,
you
have
some
patents
which
they
regard
--
are
regarded
as
substantially
advancing
the
odd
and
there
you
get
much
more
protection
than
one
that's
just
a
slight
improvement
which
may
technically
be
patentable.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
no.
i
mean
on
the
law
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
well,
i
will
explain.
for
example,
supposing
this
was
a
basic
invention,
my
spectacles,
let's
assume
that
and
i've
provided
in
my
patent
application
that
i
used
plastic.
if
this
was
a
basic
invention,
i
would
not
only
get
--
get
protection
for
spectacles
made
with
plastic,
i'd
get
it
for
anything
that
was
its
equivalent.
in
other
words
i'd
get
it
if
it
happened
to
be
wood
or
happen
to
be
any
other
substance
whereas
if
this
was
just
regarded,
even
though
it
was
patented
as
just
an
ordinary
invention,
i
would
be
limited
to
what
i
specified
in
the
patent
application.
if
i
said
particular
kind
of
plastic
that's
all
the
protection
i
would
get.
so,
what
we
are
saying
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
that's
right,
your
honor
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
you
have
to
have
an
invention
that
substantially
advances
the
odds
to
have
this
doctrine
of
equivalents.
you
have
to
have
in
this
case
something
that
creates
a
new
field.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
there
are
quite
a
few
cases
on
it,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
i'd
like
to
say
that's
--
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
m.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
now,
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
reply
but
i
just
want
to
mention
one
thing
else.
the
government
in
its
brief
and
it
tries
to
make
a
point
that
it
was
really
the
mining
industry
that
promoted
section
456
at
the
congressional
hearing.
this
doesn't
happen
to
be
so.
there
were
others
interested
in
the
relief
provisions
including
one
official
of
polaroid
who
testified
at
those
hearings.
but
in
the
mining
industry
he
wasn't
particularly
interested
in
section
456.
the
government
quotes
a
sentence
from
one
of
the
spokesmen
who
said
that
the
principle
of
section
721
should
be
continued
with
revisions
but
the
following
sentence
in
his
--
his
testimony
is
this.
the
special
provision
we
recommend
for
allowance
of
a
reasonable
profit
per
unit
of
output
may
make
section
721
unnecessary,
but
many
of
the
mining
cases
which
would
otherwise
fall
under
its
provisions,
but
there
still
seems
to
be
a
need
for
section
721
as
applicable
to
other
cases.
the
mining
industry
really
didn't
care
about
456.
they
were
interested
in
the
excess
exempt
output
--
exempt
excess
output
sections,
the
strategic
minerals
material
section
and
so
forth.
and
in
essence,
that
was
what
they
were
after
and
they
got
it
in
other
sections
of
the
--
of
the
law
and
i'd
like
to
have
whatever
i
have
left
as
a
reply
your
honor
please?
