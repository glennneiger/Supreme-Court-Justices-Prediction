mr.
cummings
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
before
that
literacy
is
defined
in
the
oxford
dictionary,
this
may
shed
some
light
on
the
constitutional
use
of
discoveries.
justice
felix
frankfurter
according
to
the
oxford
dictionary,
discovery
is
a
--
technical
american,
united
states
mining
term.
the
first
quotation
they
give
is
in
1802.
it
may
well
be
that
in
course
of
time
with
those
quixotisms
and
oddities
by
which
words
change
their
meaning
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
their
color
without
being
disloyal
to
each
other,
themselves.
it
may
well
be
that
discovery
in
the
--
in
the
constitutional
draft
of
the
1787,
at
its
generalized
meaning
of
the
disclosure
of
something
new
and
that
in
america,
even
if
they're
not
in
england,
discovery
does
have
a
technical
application
to
the--
the
processes
of
mining.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
i
mean
that
may
shed
light
on
why
that
in
1787
discovery
it
may've
had
this
generalized
meaning
and
not
yet
received.
i
don't
suppose
there
was
so
much
mining
going
on
except
surface
scratching
in
1787
in
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
timeless
picture
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
refer
(inaudible)
that
it
is
--
the
answer
is
easy.
if
it
isn't
--
if
it
isn't
significant,
it
is
non-invention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
can't
be
--
if
it's
an
invention,
it
must
be
significant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
opinions
that
convey
that
property.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
statute
is
still
in
force,
upon
with
all
facts
of
deterrent
patentability
at
the
same
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
not
using
the
significant
and
more
dramatic
phrase
of
flash
of
genius,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
no
antecedent,
there
must
be.
it
required
that
there
was
no
antecedent
to
what
your
discovery
had
in
demand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
a
patent
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
necessarily
to
be
a
valid
patent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
some
--
some
applications
are
granted
and
some
are
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
starting
to
get
law
protection
from
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
a
wrinkle
of
the
doctrine
of
equivalents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
have
to
tell
you
that
doctrine
of
equivalents
in
itself
to
do
this
doctrine
or
its
application
is,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
quite
a
few
cases
and
quite
a
few
opinions
too.
i
mean,
conflicting
opinions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
it
doesn't
bear
on
the
construction
of
what
is
done
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
by
virtue
of
this
stipulation
an
atypical
case
is
before
the
court,
namely,
the
case
in
which
the
inventor
or
the
discoverer
--
so
we're
taking
the
petitioner's
point
of
view
--
the
discoverer
finances
himself,
it
is
(inaudible)
expenses,
is
that
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
this
is
an
atypical
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
must
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
just
going
behind
the
stipulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
which
your
accounting
difficulty
doesn't
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
answer
--
your
implicit
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
is
we
can't
--
that
this
case
doesn't
undercut
your
argument
that
as
a
practical
matter
it
is
difficult
to
make
these
allocations
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
this
a
--
this
is
a
white
throw.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
license
instead
of
a
duty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
presumably,
here
is
a
measure
that
comes
out
of
the
joint
committee,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it
is
about
as
trained
as
technical
core
of
any
committee
that
congress
has?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
trained
technically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
trained
body
of
technical
advisers
of
any
committee,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
a
number
of
senators
were
deeply
interested
in
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
presumably
read
it,
presumably.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
they
can't
go
on
the
assumption
that
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
didn't
mean
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
they
allowed
and
retained
what
the
house
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
senate
--
the
house
did
not
recede
on
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
consistent
with
the
way
they
measure
that
for
the
senate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
uncommon,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
it
(inaudible)
legislatively
phrased
classification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
power
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
to
contract
or
expand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
barnett,
you
just
quoted
senator
george
and
your
name's
sake
led
me
to
the
congressional
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
say
to
the
exchange
to
which
he
referred
between
the
senator
from
georgia
and
the
senator
from
colorado
(inaudible)
senator
george?
i
don't
-
i
am
going
back,
but
i
gather
that
senator
georgia
was
not
in
charge
of
the
bill,
that
the
bill
was
in
charge
of
senator
harrison.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
chairman
of
the
finance
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
it
would,
harrison,
the
authoritative
spokesman
and
i
myself
and
--
we
can
say
constitutional
as
a
matter
of
experience
leery
of
quick
answers
by
senators
to
accommodate
some
senator
and
for
some
reason
to
satisfy,
but
it
does
interest
me
that
it
was
mr.
adamson
who
said
i'm
not
speaking
out
alone
of
mining
company,
it
could
apply
equally
to
an
inventor.
mr.
adamson
of
colorado
was
of
course
was
chiefly
in
dispute
in
the
mining
industry
of
(inaudible)
and
senator
georgia
that
replies
to
all.
now,
it
makes
a
difference
to
me,
whether
georgia
was
in
charge
and
georgia
was
the
spokesman
for
the
measure
or
wasn't.
i
gather
he
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
an
opinion.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
you
can
rely
on
senator
georgia
on
one
aspect
of
the
case
and
then
you
grate
his
authority
in
another
aspect
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
consider
that
colloquy
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
he
is
talking
about
this
bill.
this
bill
and
some
of
its
provisions
give
him
a
chance
to
build
up
for
better
days
of
more
accurate
days
and
it's
also
gets
for
the
corporation
of
the
option
of
the
term
makes
it
turn
to
texas,
that
senator
texas
finally
(inaudible)
the
obligation.
it
is
a
rapidly
growing
(inaudible)
very
great
benefit
particularly
to
companies
which
are
rapidly
growing,
companies
which
is
more
or
less
speculate
in
their
operation
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
reading
march
3rd,
1941.
i
believe
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
was
left
out
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
georgia's
answer
is
any
(inaudible)
goes
the
other
way.
