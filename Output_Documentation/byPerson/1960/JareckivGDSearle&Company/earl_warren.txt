chief

do
i
understand,
mr.

that
--
that
your
opinion
within

like
we
had
the
other
day
with
that
automobile
top
--
chief
justice
earl

--
which
is
not
something
that
i
assume
you
would
call
discovery
that
--
that
if
--
if
their
patent
provided
that
it
was
metal
and
the
metal
and

can
this
that
someone
else
could
come
along
and
use

plastics

not
be
guilty
