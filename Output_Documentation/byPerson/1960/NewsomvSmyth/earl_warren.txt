versus

superintendent
of

state
penitentiary.
senator
boothe,
you
may
continue
your
argument
if
you
--
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
or
hadn't
--
had
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
concluded.
very
well.
and
mr.
harp,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
i
ask
--
on
what
theory
the
case
was
argued
in
your
--
in
your
supreme
court
and
on
what
theory
the
court
decided
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
take
too
much
about
what
until
last
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
neither
your
response
nor
your
brief
raised
that
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
ask
just
one
more
question
about
this
and
i
understood
you
to
say
in
the
response
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
that
another
lawyer
handled
the
case
for
the
state
and
he
did
not
raise
that
question
but
that
you
would've,
but
i
notice
at
the
brief
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
in
the
case,
that
bears
your
name.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harp,
business
is
a
little
different
from
the
case
you
were
just
telling
us
about
two
months
ago
because
there,
the
court
did
appoint
a
lawyer
for
the
man
and
the
court
did
advise
him
that
or
the
lawyer
did
advise
him
on
his
appeal
that
he
had
no
case.
and
the
court,
after
having
appointed
counsel,
said
that
he
had
not
--
had
gotten
that
reaction
from
him
and
he
suffered
no
injury.
but
here,
here,
a
man
is
apparently
from
what
we
can
see
here
has
been
abandoned
by
his
lawyers
so
far
as
the
appeal
is
concerned.
the
lawyers
may
have
had
reason
for
it.
they
may
have
had
no
reason.
we
don't
know.
but
apparently,
obviously
from
his
letters,
that
he
wrote
to
the
judges
within
the
statutory
time
for
appeal.
his
case
had
been
abandoned
by
his
lawyers.
he
was
doing
everything
he
could
as
an
individual
to
--
to
note
his
appeal
and
get
it
moving
and
he
was
writing
to
the
judge
saying
that
i
--
i
haven't
had
the
time,
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
a
lawyer
and
so
finally,
i
appealed
to
you
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
me
and
that
was
within
the
statutory
time
for
taking
an
appeal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
don't
have
any
of
that
here
before
us
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
all
we
know
are
these
letters
and
because
they
are
--
because
they
are
briefs,
maybe
i
can
read
them
in
--
this
first
one,
eight
days
after
he
was
ordered
committed
to
the
penitentiary
reads,
"in
lieu
of
any
known
action
on
the
part
of
my
attorneys,
i
am
taking
this
method
of
respectfully
noting
an
appeal,
from
the
life
sentences
imposed
upon
me
in
your
court
from
april
10th,
1953.
i
will,
within
the
allotted
time,
attempt
to
get
counsel
to
complete
the
appeal."
then
five
days
later,
he
wrote
a
second
letter
in
which
he
said,
"due
to
circumstances
beyond
my
control,
i
have
been
unable
to
complete
arrangements
with
an
attorney
to
complete
my
appeal.
therefore,
i
respectfully
request
that
you
appoint
me
counsel
to
appeal
my
case
to
the
state
supreme
court
of
appeals."
now,
isn't
the
firm
interpretation
of
that
he
--
that
he
had
no
lawyer,
that
he
was
doing
his
best
to
appeal,
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer
and
that
he
requested
the
court
to
appoint
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
senator
boothe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
senator
boothe,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
should
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
your
representation
of
this
indigent
defendant.
we're
always
comforted
when
lawyers
will
accept
assignments
of
this
kind.
we
know
they're
burdensome.
and
mr.
harp,
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
we
--
we
appreciate
the
earnest
and
diligent
manner
in
which
you
represented
the
interest
of
your
state.
