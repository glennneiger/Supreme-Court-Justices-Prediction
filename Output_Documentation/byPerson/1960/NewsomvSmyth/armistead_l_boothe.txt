mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
extremely
simple
and
the
facts
themselves
are
--
or
should
be
very
brief.
it
involves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
convicted
felon
is
entitled
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
counsel
on
appeal.
it
counts
the
felon
also
being
an
indigent
and
being
a
man
who
has
been
tried
for
capital
offense,
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
the
facts
are
that
on
april
10,
1953,
stuart
newsom
was
tried
in
the
hustings
court
in
the
city
of
richmond,
was
convicted
before
a
jury
and
was
sentenced.
eight
days
later,
he
wrote
to
the
trial
judge
noting
an
appeal
and
saying
that
he
propose
to
get
counsel.
five
days
after
that,
on
april
23,
1953
or
13
days
after
his
conviction,
he
then
wrote
the
judge
and
said
that
due
to
circumstances
beyond
his
control,
he
could
not
get
counsel
and
asked
the
court
to
appoint
an
attorney
for
him.
he
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
was
tried
with
his
own
counsel
and
the
counsel
whom
he
himself
has
selected.
that
counsel
stayed
in
the
case
until
the
conclusion
of
the
trial
when
he
made
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
verdict
and
for
a
new
trial,
which
was
denied.
thereafter,
he
was
not
in
the
case
and
from
then
on,
he
did
not
have
counsel
in
this
proceeding.
actually,
no
appeal
was
ever
taken
from
that
conviction.
he
did
not
hear
from
the
court
and
no
appeal
was
--
was
had.
on
january
12,
1959,
that
is
nearly
six
years
later,
he
filed
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
asked
the
court
to
grant
his
petition
under
section
--
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process
clause
and
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
actually,
what
he
did
was
--
no,
it
was
not
federal
habeas
corpus.
he
went
into
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
and
judge
young
heard
his
habeas
corpus
petition
and
in
a
very
well-reasoned
opinion,
which
is
in
the
record
ending
at
page
27,
he
denied
i
say
a
well-reasoned
opinion
as
a
magnificent
opinion
up
to
the
last
paragraph.
and
you
would
think
that
up
to
that
time,
he
was
going
to
decide
the
case
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
then
from
that
decision,
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
judge
young's
decision
and
memorandum
were
offered
and
dense
the
petitioner
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
1953,
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
there
was
no
appeal.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that
is
--
that
is
right,
sir.
then
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
there's
--
there's
no
statute
requiring
that
he'd
be
--
that
he'd
know
that
--
now,
he
--
he
did
know
it.
he
knew
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
he
knew
he
had
the
right
to
appeal
because
he
asked
the
trial
judge.
he
wrote
the
trial
judge
on
april
23rd
in
this
letter
which
is
in
the
record
at
page
14,
i
believe
it
is,
asking
for
an
appointment
of
counsel.
it
is
in
the
record
14.
he
said,
"due
to
set
you
up,"
now
this
is
the
judge
who
tried
him,
the
judge
who
sentenced
him
to
life
imprisonment
and
who
later
recommended
that
he
not
even
be
paroled,
this
is
three
years
later.
he
said,
"due
to
circumstances
beyond
my
control,
i
have
been
unable
to
complete
arrangements
with
an
attorney
to
complete
my
appeal.
therefore,
i
respectfully
request
that
you
appoint
me
counsel
to
appeal
my
case
to
the
state
supreme
court
of
appeals."
he
asked
for
counsel.
he
pled
for
counsel.
this
is
13
days
after
his
conviction
and
he
never
heard
from
the
judge.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
i
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that's
right.
so
had
--
he
noted
an
appeal
and
said
he
was
going
to
--
to
attempt
to
get
counsel.
in
my
opening
statement,
i
mentioned
both
these
letters
but
i
slurred
them
all
and
i
appreciate
the
emphasis
which
you
have
given
to
my
words.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
oh
no,
sir,
he
wanted
the
--
he
wanted
an
appeal.
he
requested
it
from
the
very
beginning
and
as
i
say,
he
did
not
hear
from
the
judge
and
therefore,
no
appeal
was
taken
from
--
in
--
in
that
--
from
this
original
conviction.
was
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
actually,
you
have
four
months
in
which
to
present
your
petition
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
virginia.
i
have
that
statute
in
the
brief.
and
also,
one
other
limitation,
he
was
required
by
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
to
present
a
transcript
of
the
record
of
the
evidence,
the
typewritten
part
of
the
evidence
to
the
judge
within
60
days
from
conviction
or
from
the
date
of
the
order,
and
that
had
to
be
signed
by
the
judge
to
consent.
so
they
are
the
two
periods.
he
had
60
days
to
present
the
evidence
and
four
months
to
present
the
petition
for
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
it's
all
right
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'll
deal
with
it
right
--
right
now
sir.
i
don't
--
don't
feel
that
an
interruption
of
--
of
that
importance
should
be
disregarded.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
that
the
clearest
answer
to
the
contention
that
this
man
was
not
pauper
in
the
record.
is
the
language
of
judge
young
himself
on
page
27
of
the
record
where
he
summarizes
the
exact
question
before
him.
and
at
the
middle
of
the
page,
he
quotes
from
the
--
the
griffin
case,
as
i
recall,
only
citing
a.l.r.
--
or
maybe
he's
there
citing
an
a.l.r.
note
and
he
says,
"whether
an
indigent
defendant
is,
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
entitled
to
counsel
on
appeal
is
a
question
which
has
not
yet
been
squarely
decided
by
the
united
states
supreme
court."
then
he
goes
on
down
and
quotes
the
annotation
in
law
edition
of
the
supreme
court
reporter
and
then
he
says,
"whether
this
view
be
correct
or
incorrect
is
of
course
the
question
in
the
instant
case."
now,
the
view
that
he's
speaking
about
is
the
annotator's
view
that
the
establishment
of
a
rule
that
a
state
must,
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law,
provide
indigents
with
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
prosecute
appeals
and
criminal
cases
would
appear
to
be
no
more
than
a
logical
extension
of
the
griffin
doctrine
and
of
course,
the
case
of
griffin
against
illinois.
now,
whether
this
view,
whether
this
room
that
a
--
an
indigent
criminal
must
be
appointed
counsel
to
help
prosecute
as
a
field,
whether
that
view
is
correct
or
incorrect,
is
the
question
in
the
instant
case.
now,
all
through
his
decision,
judge
--
judge
young
acknowledged
that
on
pages
24
and
25
in
at
least
five
places.
he
speaks
of
--
of
virginia
statutes
dealing
with
the
furnishing
of
counsel
to
paupers
with
virginia
statutes
which
relieved
indigents
of
cause
on
appeal
of
the
double
misfortune
of
being
stricken
with
poverty
and
accused
of
crime,
and
of
the
fact
that
courts
of
records
under
--
even
in
virginia
have
decided
that
where
--
that
those
courts
do
have
inherit
authority
to
appoint
counsel
to
defend
paupers
and
other
indigent
persons.
he
is
speaking
and
treating
this
entire
case
as
though
the
man
were
an
--
an
indigent.
counsel
says
--
or
the
other
attorney
general
says
that
he
has
to
do
that
because
there
are
so
many
cases
that
involved
indigents.
but
my
answer
to
that
is
that
if
he
will
not
deal
with
a
case
of
an
indigent
and
if
he
felt
that
this
should
go
off
on
the
ground
that
the
man
was
not
an
indigent,
all
he
would
have
to
say
is
that
none
of
these
cases
are
applicable,
this
man
is
not
an
indigent
and
therefore,
i
dismiss
his
claim.
he
did
not
do
that.
he
treated
him
as
an
indigent
and
he
still
decided
the
case
as
if
he
were
an
indigent.
now
actually,
and
i
--
with
some
interpretation,
i
did
follow
a
short
file,
a
short
reply
brief
in
this
case
and
i
felt
that
since
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
had
put
in
by
25
pages
in
his
appendix
of
opinions
from
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
--
and
the
district
court
of
united
states
and
other
cases
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
then
i
would
justify
doing
it.
this
is
a
letter
from
the
petitioner
where
he
said
that
on
april
--
in
april
of
1953
when
he
was
convicted,
he
had
$53.03
when
he
went
in
the
penitentiary
and
approximately
$40
constituting
his
total
assets
when
he
filed
the
--
when
he
sought
to
appeal
the
case,
and
that
he
did
make
efforts
to
obtain
bonds
and
was
unsuccessful.
now,
this
is
a
letter
from
him
to
me,
which
i
requested
him
to
write
me
in
order
to
give
me
the
true
facts,
which
i
did
not
know
until
i
received
this.
so
--
and
then
there's
one
other
thing.
i
feel
that
--
i
know
that
there
is
in
the
record
right
on
the
first
page
of
the
record
a
statement
that
in
january
of
1959,
he
was
poor
--
i
think
it
was
$27
then
in
the
--
in
the
penitentiary.
there
are
those
things,
but
i
feel
that
judge
young's
handling
the
case,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
the
--
is
the
most
conclusive
of
proof
that
this
was
treated
in
this
way.
and
as
i
say,
if
--
if
he
hadn't
treated
it
that
way,
he
could
have
said,
"well,
had
the
man
been
an
indigent,
i'd
have
given
him
relief.
but
since
he
wasn't,
i
won't."
and
he
--
he
didn't
do
that
at
all.
he
treated
it
as
an
indigent's
case
and
that
is
the
exact
opinion,
the
exact
memorandum,
the
order
of
the
identical
judge
from
which
certiorari
was
granted
ultimately
quote
by
this
court.
now
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
no,
sir.
appealability
is
not
now
a
matter
of
right.
it's
a
matter
of
the
court's
discretion.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
the
appellate
court.
in
other
words,
in
virginia,
you
petition
for
an
appeal
or
whether
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
it's
--
it's
within
the
court's
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that's
right,
sir.
it's
like
the
good
--
good
man
at
the
other
state.
as
you
all
have
cited
in
the
griffin
case
and
substantive
cases.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
all
by
leave
of
court.
you
have
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
automatic
appeal?
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
it's
always
been
a
matter
of
discretion
of
--
in
the
court.
we
have
two
--
in
other
words,
there
are
two
steps.
you
file
a
petition
for
appeal
and
the
other
side
follows,
even
with
criminal
cases,
files
of
an
action.
then
you
go
before
the
court
and
only
the
petitioner
or
the
appellant
has
the
privilege
of
speaking
orally
to
the
court
at
that
time.
the
appeal
is
even
granted
or
refused.
if
it's
granted,
then
you
have
a
hearing
for
the
whole
court.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
oh
no!
no,
not
just
yet.
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
have
a
--
he
didn't
have
an
opportunity
for
a
discretionary
view
because
he
didn't
have
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
oh
no,
sir.
oh
--
oh
yes,
you
--
you
--
always
discretionary.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
oh,
i
see
what
you
mean.
that
--
i
--
that
is
correct.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that
is
correct.
i
remember
in
your
--
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
griffin
case,
you
pointed
out
how
recently
you've
been
(inaudible).
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
and
--
or
in
the
federal
courts
of
this
country.
well,
i
say
we've
always
had
the
right
of
appeal.
i
do
not
--
i
--
i
cannot
say
how
long
we've
had
to
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
no,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
is
it
often
denied?
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
actually,
i
did
point
out
in
my
brief
this
complimentary
question
with
a
complimentary
answer
to
what
you've
just
asked.
since
1950
in
virginia,
there
--
there
have
been
167
criminal
cases
in
which
appeals
have
been
allowed.
now,
if
you
watch
the
decisions
coming
down
year
after
year,
appeals
are
granted
in
approximately
half
the
cases
where
they
are
requested.
now,
in
criminal
cases
in
virginia,
out
of
167
cases
in
which
they
were
granted,
they
--
they
reversed
96
and
affirmed
71
since
1950.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
some
of
those
were
remanded.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker?
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that
is
correct,
sir.
or
--
no,
in
virginia,
the
--
they
jury
sets
the
sentence
and
the
jury
gave
him
life
imprisonment.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
a
new
trial
might
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
no,
sir.
the
--
the
attorney
general
claims
that
he
did
not
allege
any
error
in
the
--
in
his
petition
of
habeas
corpus.
he
didn't
allege
any
error,
which
would
--
he
just
said
he
wanted
counsel,
in
other
words.
i
think
substantially,
that
is
true
except
that
he
said
that
in
--
in
his
layman's
language,
he
said
that
the
court
have
not
aided
him
sufficiently
in
effecting
an
appeal.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
now,
he
--
he
did
not,
but
mister
--
mr.
justice
whittaker,
please
let
me
say
this.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
i
think
that
that
is
one
example
of
the
absolute
necessity
and
fairness
in
cases
of
this
time
for
a
man
to
have
an
attorney.
i
don't
see
how
we
can
expect
a
layman
even
with
all
the
expert
advice
he's
got
inside
that
penitentiary
to
make
these
petitions
complete
and
to
make
--
to
expect
him
to
make
all
the
technical
allegations
he
should
such
as
that
number
one,
i
specifically
am
a
pauper,
number
two,
the
errors
of
the
court
from
which
i
wish
to
appeal
are
such
and
such.
now,
i
think
that
if
he
is
given
counsel,
then
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
can
very
quickly
determine
in
an
appeal
from
that
case
whether
there
was
any
error,
and
had
he
been
given
counsel
when
he
asked
for
it,
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
would
have
decided
the
case
or
the
record
and
if
he
had
no
error,
the
case
would
have
been
over
with
in
1954.
that's
what
i
--
what
i
feel
should
have
been
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
i
feel
that
--
that
of
course
it
is
a
matter
of
a
state
legislatures
to
determine
the
circumstances
under
which
appeal
should
be
granted
and
--
and
not
--
and
not
granted,
and
under
which
within
the
framework
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
counsel
should
be
appointed.
and
at
the
same
time,
i
feel
that
even
a
decision
of
a
trial
judge
that
this
was
a
frivolous
appeal
is
something
which
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
along
with
its
decision
of
the
whole
case
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
--
avail
his
right
to
counsel
really
surpasses
that
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
seven.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
had
they
asked
him?
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
that
appeal
--
if
--
if
he
was
allowed
to
do
that,
he
would
be
given
say
half
of
his
privileges
because
if
they
heard
him,
of
course,
and
decided
that
they
would
hear
the
appeal
and
then
assign
him
counsel,
he
would
be
given
full
relief.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
oh
no
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
then
--
then
i
feel
that
he
has
not
--
if
they
decide
that
they
will
go
no
further,
then
i
feel
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right
because
it's
very
possible
that
an
attorney
may
have
presented
a
more
effective
case
for
him.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
of
course
yes,
sir.
and
he
would
know
the
case
and
--
and
--
rather
than
--
than
this
man.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
you
look
at
his
language
in
the
petition,
some
of
it
is
quite
picturesque
but
it
just
slightly
misses
the
mark.
you
know
what
he
is
trying
to
drive
at
and
--
and
it's
amazing
how
close
he
does
--
he
does
get
to
it.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
as
i
said,
within
60
days,
you
have
to
--
it's
--
the
rules
of
court
specified
the
pleadings
and
certain
other
papers
will
automatically
become
part
of
the
record.
to
get
the
transcript
to
the
evidence
in
and
of
course,
there
was
a
transcript
here,
you
must
--
counsel
either
agrees
on
it
or
don't
agree
but
in
any
event,
it's
presented
to
the
judge
within
60
days
and
he
must
sign
it
within
70
to
make
it
a
part
of
the
record.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
that's
correct,
sir.
then
the
whole
thing
goes
down.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
it
--
it
stayed
there,
that's
right.
it
stayed
in
the
--
in
the
hustings
court.
nothing
--
nothing
else
happened.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
in
the
trial
court,
yes,
they
get
$40
now.
they
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
mr.
harp
tells
you
to
get
a
hundred.
i
didn't
realize
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
for
the
trial.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
(inaudible)
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
i
--
i
feel
that
that's
true
and
i
think
it
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
i
feel
that
that
is
--
it
is
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
i
think
that
it
--
it
--
to
my
mind,
it
satisfies
--
it
satisfied
the
doubt
in
which
on
the
interest
that
i
had
in
mr.
harlan's
dissent
in
the
griffin
case,
i
think
here
we
are
asking
for
the
appointment
of
help
which
doesn't
place
any
burden
on
the
state,
any
financial
burden
on
the
state.
i
think
that
here,
rather
than
ask
the
state
to
take
some
appropriate
funds
for
transcripts
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
exactly,
and
i
--
i
think
truthfully
that
this
is
a
responsibility
which
the
bar
would
accept
and
possibly,
some
would
--
would
even
enjoy.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
mr.
justice,
i
feel
that
it
is
both.
i
feel
that
--
that
under
the
due
process
clause,
it
is
absolutely
--
it's
just
as
essential
in
cases
on
appeal
for
counsel
to
be
appointed
as
it
is
in
cases
in
the
trial
court.
and
i
think
actually
that
(inaudible)
against
pennsylvania
and
pennsylvania
against
(inaudible)
bring
forth
which
the
normal
step
would
be
to
say
that
if
we're
to
guarantee
true
constitutional
rights
to
--
for
these
defendants
in
--
in
--
in
these
cases
that
they
should
be
granted
counsel
all
the
way
through.
i
feel
that
that
was
sort
of
the
inference
that
i
got
in
the
chestnut
case,
i
think.
i
believe
you
wrote
the
opinion
in
that
when
you
indicated
that
all
the
way
through,
the
--
these
proceedings,
as
you
mentioned
it,
the
man
was
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
no,
that's
right,
except
that
was
the
case
where
a
record
was
being
made
up
at
the
trial.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
certainly
if
you
--
if
you
followed
those
cases,
that's
--
that's
the
brady
case
that
you
feel
it
in
the
capital
cases
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
certainly,
yes
it
should
be.
that
was
of
course
the
first
distinction
made
by
this
court
i
believe
in
the
trial
courts
and
later
on
it
was
extended
to
all
felony
cases
where
it
was
felt
that
it
would
be
really
unfair.
first,
he
was
not
fairly
protected
unless
he
did
have
counsel.
now,
he
then
also
feel
that
the
--
the
--
that
the
case
of
griffin
against
illinois,
which
relied
upon
the
equal
protection
clause,
too,
would
be
applicable
here
because
certainly,
if
you
have
two
litigants
convicted
of
the
same
offense
and
one
is
able
to
get
a
lawyer
and
one
is
not
and
one
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
doesn't
get
it,
there's
no
question
about
who
has
the
better
chance.
but
personally,
i
feel
that
a
man
has
a
better
chance
nowadays
with
the
--
with
perry
mason
and
all
the
other
shows
on
television
to
defend
himself
in
the
trial
court
than
he
does
on
appeal.
we
have
got
one-third
--
one-third
of
the
rule
of
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
to
deal
with
appeals.
we've
got
a
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
i
say,
one-third
of
the
--
of
the
--
i've
put
that
in
my
brief,
i
think,
on
page
6,
nearly
15
pages,
comprising
one-third
of
all
the
rules
of
our
supreme
court
of
appeals.
this
is
a
trial
rule,
common
law
rules,
equity
rules,
deferred
rules,
one-third
on
being
repealed.
we
have
34
technical
sections
in
the
court
dealing
with
appeals
and
then
of
course
we've
got
a
myriad
of
decisions
of
the
courts
interpreting
the
statutes
and
the
rules
and
if
i
was
a
criminal
today
and
have
my
choice,
i'd
rather
defend
myself
in
a
trial
court
and
would
try
to
--
in
trying
to
perfect
an
appeal.
and
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
oh
yes,
sir,
yes.
and
then
i
--
i
cannot
think
of
--
of
a
better
example
we've
got
right
in
this
case
where
it
will
answer
mr.
justice
whittaker's.
this
man
didn't
say
“i
want
to
appeal
because
certain
errors,
errors
that
were
committed
by
the
court.”
he
didn't
have
to
do
that.
he
didn't
even
--
he
wasn't
even
careful
enough
to
say,
i
was
an
indigent
at
the
time.
and
i
think
that
nothing
is
more
proof
for
us
than
the
need
of
an
action
by
this
court
to
establish
this
constitution.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
sir,
i
will
say
this
that,
of
course,
that
should
be
taken
into
consideration
but
this
court
has
held
and
it
urges
that
waiting
seven
years
is
not
too
long
in
the
florida
case
at
eight
years
is
not
too
long
and
(inaudible)
that
18
years
was
not
too
long
for
a
man
to
go
back
and
--
and
say,
a
constitutional
right,
a
right
guaranteed
needed
by
the
constitution
of
united
states
has
been
--
and
i
feel
that
--
you
see,
he
didn't
latched
on
to
this
--
this
--
this
--
he
filed
several
other
proceedings
or
one
of
the
main
proceeding.
he
started
a
hornet's
nest
--
well
i
won't
go
into
that
because
i
didn't
do
the
case.by
filing
one
action
has
made
the
case
--
the
state
filed
actions.
but
he
did
not
realize
or
comprehend
the
constitu
--
this
constitutional
issue
until
he
filed
a
pleading
in
1959.
if
he
had
an
attorney,
it
wouldn't
have
arisen.
if
the
court
had
just
gave
him
a
lawyer
when
asked
for
it,
it
would
have
terminated
and
gone
away
with
litigation
which
have
extended
over
seven
years,
almost
eight.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
in
1959,
that
was
when
he
filed
this
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
asking
if
he'd
be
turn
loose
on
the
ground
that
he
was
being
denied
his
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
no.
that
--
that
was
--
that
was
the
burden
of
his
complaint
in
this
case
and
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
done
that.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
in
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
in
1959?
yes.
there
is
a
lawyer
who
was
appointed
by
the
court
beforehand.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
i
think
that
he
is
entitled
to
have
an
appeal
sir
and
i
suggest
it
in
my
brief
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
court
the
--
now
to
be
sent
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
with
the
suggestion
that
counsel
will
be
appointed
for
him.
and
say
what
they
have
tried
to
do
and
there
are
general
jurisdictions
of
the
trial.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
sir?
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
no,
there
wasn't
and
that
was
one
thing
the
--
the
transcript
wasn't
made
up
until
september
1953
which
was
such
as
it
was
but
i
believe
this
that
that
issue
would
be
settled
if
he
gets
a
good
counsel.
judge
douglas
is
still
there
and
judge
douglas
made
notes.
after
the
appeal
further
expire
of
the
evidence
given
by
three
of
the
witnesses.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
no
sir,
there
were
not.
they
were
not
--
they
were
not
taken.
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
i
mean
they
were
not
written
off
but
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
as
the
--
as
the
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
well,
we
don't
have
court
reporters
in
the
state
court
and
the
man
has
got
to
get
his
--
mr.
armistead
l.
boothe
yes
sir,
and
in
this
case,
he
wrote
up
notes
on
the
testimony
given
by
three
witnesses
but
as
i
say,
that
was
done
after
the
period
had
expired
for
appeal,
done
september
1953,
september
24,
1953,
and
that's
shown
in
the
--
in
judge
hoffman's
opinion
which
i
--
i
don't
think
has
got
any
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
