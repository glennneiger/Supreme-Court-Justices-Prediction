mr.
armistead
l.boothe
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
--
may
it
please
--
i
had
concluded
my
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
mr.
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
i
should
--
i
should
like
very
briefly
to
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
--
try
and
answer
one
or
two
questions
which
have
been
raised.
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
have
obtained
section
8-596
of
the
virginia
code
and
very
practically,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
could've
been
filed
either
before
the
judge,
who
entered
the
original
judgement
order
or
in
the
circuit
court
of
corporation
court
of
any
--
of
any
or
any
judge
of
either
in
vacation
in
the
county
or
city
in
which
the
man
was
detained.
now,
the
court
of
law
and
equity
part
ii
in
the
hustings
court,
they
have
a
pretty
similar
jurisdiction
and
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
the
man
was
absolutely
right
in
going
to
any
court,
any
trial
court,
any
court
of
record
in
the
jurisdiction
which
he
was
--
detained
which
was
richmond
city.
and
i
don't
believe
that
counsel
will
--
will
deny
that
even
though
that's
not
shown
in
the
record.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
black
asked
a
good
question.
well,
i'll
--
i'll
come
back
to
that
a
little
bit
later.
now,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
touch
upon
this
question
again
raised
for
the
first
time,
not
in
the
response,
not
in
the
brief
that
the
man's
not
held
under
the
order
which
is
in
the
record.
now,
this
is
the
stipulated
record
and
the
order
is
at
--
appears
on
page
10
--
page
11
as
being
the
--
being
a
part
of
the
record
and
we're
now
told
that
he's
held
under
this
record,
under
this
order
but
under
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order
issued
as
a
matter
of
fact,
several
years
later.
now,
if
that
were
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order
and
if
it
is
in
effect,
what
it
says
it
is,
then
it
takes
the
place
of
and
it's
substituted
for
this
order
and
the
man
would
be
appealing
from
the
same
order
changed
only
to
add
the
name
of
the
12
jurors,
which
was
originally
wrongfully
admitted
from
the
--
from
the
first
order.
now,
this
nunc
pro
tunc
order
actually,
was
started
after
this
man
in
march
of
1956,
filed
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
ground
that
he
had
been
tried
only
by
11
jurors.
and
then
the
state
in
november
of
1956,
more
than
three
years
after
the
--
the
original
proceedings
proposed
and
--
and
did
have
this
nunc
pro
tunc
order
drawn
up.
now,
one
other
comment
i
would
like
to
make,
mr.
justice
clark,
was
referring
to
judge
hoffman's
opinion
and
the
dates
there
i
think,
sir,
that
we
could
note
it
in
the
third
paragraph
in
appendix
4
of
the
state's
brief.
it
said
there
that
a
few
days
--
that
--
that
the
--
the
judge
did
make
up,
i
beg
your
pardon,
it's
not
on
appendix
4,
it's
--
it's
on
appendix
page
2
--
in
the
appendix
at
page
2
of
the
--
of
the
state's
brief.
they
said
that,
"while
no
transcript
of
evidence
is
available,
a
summary
was
prepared
and
signed
by
counsel"
and
mr.
justice
clark,
i
mentioned
that
was
his
counsel
at
the
--
who
had
been
his
counsel
at
the
trial
and
who
had
not
appeared
from
the
time
he
made
his
motion
to
dismiss
and
from
the
time
he
filed
his
motion
to
dismiss
back
in
19
--
back
in
--
in
april
of
--
on
april
10
of
1953.
now
then,
here
in
september,
more
than
four
months
after
that,
when
you
couldn't
have
taken
the
case
up,
the
--
judge
hoffman
says,
the
trial
judge
--
learned
trial
judge
did
certify
the
written
testimony
of
three
of
the
witnesses
on
the
date
following
the
trial.
now,
i
--
i'm
sure
this
was
done
in
good
faith,
but
i
mentioned
those
things,
number
one,
to
say,
they
haven't
gotten
any
of
them.
they
have
no
bearing
on
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
--
this
court
has
before
the
other
day
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
does
and
i
respectfully
say
to
--
to
my
friend
and
colleague
that
because
the
case
is
so
simple,
because
the
issue
is
so
simple,
i
do
not
blame
him
for
trying
to
confuse
this
record
by
bringing
in
proceedings
which
have
gone
on
since
1956
to
date,
covering
25
pages
of
his
appendix
and
about
a
third
of
the
main
body
of
this
brief.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
--
i'm
glad
you
raised
that
because
that
was
the
question
in
regard
to
counsel
which
was
before
judge
hoffman.
there,
he
was
complaining
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
his
counsel
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
that's
right.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
well
now,
that
--
so
there
is
absolutely
no
indication
of.
i
had
--
i
did
not
see
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
well,
i
think
that
he
certainly
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
well,
this
is
--
that
is
the
--
if
they
were
the
two
alternatives
that
he
has,
if
they
were
the
two
alternative
he
had,
i
think
that
advice
might
be
--
might
be
given
and
i
know
that
facts
are
not
good
and
i
don't
like
the
facts
either,
sir.
but
here
is
a
man
who
has
never
had
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
review
his
record.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
and
he's
--
they've
never
had
a
chance
to
say,
whether
or
not,
he
was
given
a
fair
trial
and
that's
all
he's
asking
this
court
to
give
him
today.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
oh
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
that
the
issue
is
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
but
this
man
had
no
lawyer
to
so
advice
him.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
that's'
right.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
that's
right,
sir.
insofar
as
the
record
shows,
the
only
reason
that
association
was
terminated
was
because
of
his
dissatisfaction
or
was
there
effectiveness?
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
from
the
record,
that
assumption
could
be
made
that
he
was
dissatisfied.
yes,
sir.
i
cannot
--
i
do
not
feel
that
that
is
the
only
assumption
that
can
be
made.
now,
i
feel
we've
gone
a
good
deal
beyond
the
record
for
which
i
apologize.
i
think
the
states
gone
a
good
deal
beyond
the
record
and
the
state
went
beyond
the
record
before
i
did.
but
we
have
got
this
man's
own
life
before
the
court
now.
that
he
had
$40
and
--
$50.03
when
he
went
in
the
penitentiary
in
--
about
april
the
10th
--
10th
and
on
the
23rd,
when
he
was
trying
to
get
his
lawyer,
he
had
$40.
and
he
said,
"this
was
a
reason
for
my
failure
to
secure
assistance
and
why
i
requested
the
court
to
appoint
counsel.
and
i'm
sure
check
the
prisoner
records
will
reveal
them.
i
had
my
rival
here.
and
i'm
saying
to
this
court,
i'm
sure
check
of
the
prisoner
records
by
the
able
assistant
attorney
general
of
virginia
has
shown
that."
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
true.
there
is
--
there
is
this
doubt
in
the
record
and
it's
the
doubt
which
can
be
expected
when
you
realized
that
it
is
an
ignorant
man
trying
to
--
to
appeal.
now,
this
--
the
--
the
states
--
united
states,
i
mean
the
--
the
state
attorney
general
talked
about
this
man.
i've
been
down
seeing
that,
pop
news
in
the
corner.
he's
a
very
distinguished
nice
looking,
white-haired
man,
wouldn't
harm
a
fly,
if
you
looked
at
it
--
just
look
at
him.
and
of
course,
he
has
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
--
sir?
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
well,
of
course,
he
has
--
he
has
good
advice,
good
legal
advice,
there's
no
question
about
that,
in
a
way.
but
as
you
all
can
see,
he
failed
to
allege
there
was
error.
he
failed
to
allege
--
they
say
that
he
was
indigent
and
--
and
that
is
perfectly
true,
but
that
does
show
the
--
the
difficulties
in
these
cases
and
of
course,
a
man
in
his
condition.
a
man
who
does
not
know,
a
man
who
is
not
furnished
with
counsel
is
going
to
make
these
mistakes
and
the
more
ignorant
he
is,
the
longer
it
will
be
before
this
question
of
constitutional
right
will
be
decided.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
no,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
exactly.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
that
had
been
done,
look
at
the
litigation
which
would've
been
saved.
if
the
original
judge
had
given
him
a
lawyer
and
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
had
looked
at
the
record
and
said,
"your
trial
is
fair,
you
stay
where
you
are,"
it
would
have
eliminated
pounds
of
--
of
pamphlets
and
--
and
litigation.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
[laughs]
well,
they
--
they
electrocute.
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
and
now
to
say.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
we
would
dissipate
the
entire
thing.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
now
--
and
i
am,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
going
to
close
now.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
that's
alright,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
(voice
overlap)
--
and
--
and
i
--
i
feel
that
it
--
the
broader
jurisdiction
covers
the
narrow
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
--
function
which
we
perceive.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
--
i
don't
believe
that
--
i
don't
believe
that
even
the
governmental
authorities
would
feel
you
had
to
turn
a
man
loose
in
the
case
of
this
kind
and
would
feel
that
the
writ
could
be
used
for
much
--
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
--
much
more
meaning.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes.
--
unless
he's
within
a
reasonable
time,
given
a
right
to
appeal
with
counsel.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
yes,
sir.
now,
i
--
i
feel
that
in
closing,
i
--
in
one
minute,
i
would
like
to
get
right
back
to
exactly
what
the
case
was
about.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
black,
in
your
question
to
mr.
harp,
you
asked
him
to
discuss
the
merits.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
merits
as
they
appear
to
the
state.
now,
i
think
that
he's
answered
your
questioning
his
brief.
and
on
page
5,
in
the
question
presented,
he
says
in
effect,
is
a
person
--
i'm
going
to
leave
that
to
represent
him
by
counsel
of
his
choosing
because
he's
certain
of
--
he
mentioned,
a
man
represented
by
counsel
of
his
own
choosing,
when
his
counsel
has
withdrawn
from
the
case.
now
obviously,
he
has
asked
for
the
counsels.
i'm
going
to
leave
this
language
here,
just
get
right
down
to
the
very
crux
of
the
case.
is
a
person
convicted
of
a
capital
offense
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment,
entitled
to
have
court-appointed
counsel
upon
appeal,
in
the
absence
of
any
allegation
that
he
is
a
pauper?
now,
the
state
of
virginia
has
in
all
fairness
and
honesty,
not
say
--
not
said
that
he
was
not
a
pauper.
they
have
simply
based
their
entire
case
upon
the
fact
that
he
did
not,
unless
he
was
a
pauper.
they
are
admitting
when
you
seize
upon
and
look
at
that
question,
that
had
he
alleged
he
was
a
pauper?
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
--
to
have
had
counsel
representing
him
on
appeal
in
this
case.
and
winding
up
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
go
back
to
the
record,
something
from
which
we
have
won.
again
on
page
27
and
the
able,
scholarly
trial
judge
who
decided
this
very
issue,
which
is
now
before
the
court,
the
man
from
whose
decision
certiorari
has
been
granted
ultimately,
said
on
page
27,
"whether
an
indigent
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
on
appeal
has
not
yet
been
squarely
decided
by
the
united
states
supreme
court."
an
annotator
says
that
such
a
decision
in
the
affirmative
would
appear
to
be
no
more
than
a
logical
extension
of
the
griffin
doctrine.
and
then
the
judge,
in
a
nutshell,
places
the
case
by
saying
whether
this
due
be
correct
or
incorrect
is
of
course
the
question
in
the
instant
case.
now,
there's
your
evidence,
there
is
the
record
and
there
is
the
matter
which
was
before
the
trial
judge
and
which
is
before
this
honorable
court
today.
mr.
armistead
l.boothe
may
i
--
i
say,
i
--
i
have
enjoyed
the
assignment.
first,
the
opportunity
i've
had
to
appear
before
this
court
and
i'm
delighted
to
be
able
to
get
in
facto.
