justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
some
point
along
your
argument,
i
don't
want
to
anticipate
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
letter
brings
to
my
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
going
to
deal
i
suppose
with
your
adversary's
argument
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
that's
what
he
says,
that
indicates
that
this
man
was
indigent
and
therefore,
whatever
might
be
the
consequences,
otherwise
is
not
presented
by
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
trial
court
have
said
in
response
to
his
letter,
i've
looked
over
this
record
and
in
my
judgment,
this
is
a
frivolous
appeal,
i
decline
to
assign
counsel
and
then
he's
gone
up
on
to
your
supreme
court
--
the
supreme
court
has
denied
to
review
or
affirm
this
--
such
a
record.
what
was
your
position
then?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
place
the
burden
on
the
bar.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
--
is
your
element
constitutional
position
here,
a
due
process
question
or
an
equal
protection
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
we
didn't
have
that
problem.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
if
it's
a
due
process
problem,
at
least,
then
you
view
this,
the
betts
and
brady,
the
extension
of
betts
and
brady
to
appeal?
in
other
words,
was
your
--
was
your
position
is
on
due
process
mean
that
on
a
constitutional
standpoint,
he
might
be
entitled
to
a
counsel
in
such
--
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
after
the
--
depending
on
the
character
of
the
issues
on
appeal,
and
another
case
is
if
the
due
process
wouldn't
require?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
capital
cases.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
why
do
you
consider
you
are
precluded
from
raising
a
jurisdictional
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said,
you
were
out
to
lunch,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
didn't
the
lower
court
here,
the
nisi
prius
court
decide
this
case
on
the
premise
that
he
was
indigent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
--
now,
what
does
the
opinion
say?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
he
says
on
page
27,
where
--
after
citing
the
indigent
cases,
he
says,
whether
if
you'll
be
correct
or
incorrect,
is
of
course,
the
question
in
the
instant
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
mean,
he's
misapprehended
the
facts,
don't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
still,
as
it
comes
to
us
in
his
opinion,
rightly
or
wrongly,
he
premised
his
decision,
does
he
not,
on
this
fellow
being
indigent?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
the
first
time
as
far
as
you
know
that
such
a
request
has
been
made
to
your
supreme
court
to
the
appointment
of
a
lawyer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
an
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no,
i
meant
in
connection
with
an
appeal.
