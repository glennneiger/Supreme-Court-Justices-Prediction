j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
i
understand
senator
that
in
this
case,
at
least,
you're
not
asking
his
release?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
only
relief
you
want
is
that
lawyer
be
appointed
who
then
can
perfect
the
kind
of
appeal
that
he
might
have
had
had
one
been
perfected
back
at
the
time
in
1953
of
this
case?
