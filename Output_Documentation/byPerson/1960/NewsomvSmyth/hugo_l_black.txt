what

did
you
get
it
in
your
record?
justice

l.
black
(inaudible)
supreme
court
of
appeals
to
show
after
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
here,
although
i
know
it
was
on
appeal,
you
can't
just
lay
it
down.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
ask
for
in
1959
proceeding
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
right,
the
virginia
courts
has
permitted
(inaudible)
made
his
appeal
to
find
him
a
lawyer
in
the
original
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
habeas
corpus
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
lawyer
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lawyer
next
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
april
--
april
1953,
he
did
write
a
letter
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
stating
that
he
had
not
or
did
not
have
a
lawyer,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
says
he
hadn't
been
able
to
complete
arraignments
with
his
lawyer.
i
don't
suppose
that
(inaudible)
or
what's
meant
by
that
if
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he
asked
for
a
lawyer
to
represent
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
i
suppose
that
he
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
supposing
now,
that
he
was
--
had
a
lawyer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
did
he
say
in
addition
to
that,
see
appendix
--
exhibit
c
and
d,
what
was
that
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
asking
for
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
asking
for
a
lawyer.
and
asking
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
appointment
of
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
harp,
i
hope
before
your
time
is
done,
you
would
say
what
you
think
about
the
case
on
the
assumption.
the
record
shows
this
man
was
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
sentenced
to
life
that
he
asked
for
an
appeal.
thereafter,
he
wrote
the
judge
and
asked
him
to
appoint
him
a
lawyer
and
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
indigent
and
couldn't
get
one,
i'd
--
i
wish
you
would
argue
the
merits
of
it
and
further,
we
read
some
announcements.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
you
think
there
are
great
many
cases
where
a
man
who's
been
convicted
to
first
degree
murder
and
would
ask
for
attorneys
to
conducting
an
appeal
could've
been
indicted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
still
arguing
largely
on
the
basis
that
you
don't
think
this
case
ranked
up?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
will
--
i
hope
before
you
finish,
it's
up
to
you
to
use
your
time.
you
will
discuss
the
problem
whether
or
not,
you
think
it
denies
a
man
equal
protection
of
the
due
process
of
law,
who
is
an
indigent,
who
is
in
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
and
who
asked
for
a
lawyer
and
to
conduct
an
appeal
and
the
court
doesn't
give
it
to
him.
i'd
like
you
to
discuss
the
merits
of
that
constitutional
point
if
you
don't
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
think
--
you
think
it
should
be
discussed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that
probably
it
would
be
wise
to
discuss
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
i
ask
you
the
question
assuming
all
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
if
you
want
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
it's
not
usual
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
part
in
virginia
admit
if
the
man
is
able
to
hire
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
sentence
--
the
sentence
couldn't
be
imposed
on
him,
could
it,
until
he
gets
an
appeal,
if
he's
able
to
get
a
lawyer
and
files
the
proceeding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
sentence
can
be
imposed
if
it's
suspended?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
if
he
goes
to
the
supreme
court
and
it
reverses
it,
what
happens?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
at
least,
has
some
connection
with
the
formal
proceeding,
i
would
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
get
reverse
--
if
it
gets
reversed,
the
sentence
cannot
be
enforced
against
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
reversed
and
said
it
is
wrong
and
he
shouldn't
have
been
convicted,
what
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
the
problem
that
i
wanted
to
discuss
was
this.under
the
old
proceeding,
you
have
a
man
who's
been
convicted.
he's
denied
the
opportunity.
we're
assuming
to
get
the
court
give
him
that
chance
to
get
his
case
reversed
and
remanded
for
a
new
trial
solely
because
he
was
unable
to
get
attorney
and
the
court
could
--
would
not
appoint
anyone.
would
that
violate
due
process
and
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
still
what?
