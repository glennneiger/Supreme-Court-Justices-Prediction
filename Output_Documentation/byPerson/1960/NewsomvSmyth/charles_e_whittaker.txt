justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
does
that
mean
they
were
reversed
out
length
or
just
reversed
(inaudible)
and
remanded
for
trial?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
sir,
in
this
case
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
as
i
understand,
this
man
was
tried
for
murder
of
the
husband
of
his
paramour
and
that
carried
a
death
sentence
under
your
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
he
--
the
two
counsels
in
his
trial
was
able
to
secure
a
lesser
sentence
than
asked.
i
mean,
life
imprisonment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
jury
gave
him
life
imprisonment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
new
trial
would
expose
him
to
the
list
of
--
that
would
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
new
trial.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
he
led
you
to
the
place
--
i
have
seen
nothing
at
that
kind
in
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
here
suggested
that
he
had
any
defense
on
the
matter
merits?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
boothe
please.
assuming,
apart
--
apart
from
the
claim
that
he
was
entitled
to
counsel
on
his
appeal
as
an
original
proposition,
that
sentence
was
in
1953.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
fair?
is
it
right?
i
ask
you
that
he
wait
seven,
eight
years
until
the
witnesses
upon
a
new
trial
have
died,
he
is
no
longer
endanger
of
the
death
sentence
to
raise
this
question?
