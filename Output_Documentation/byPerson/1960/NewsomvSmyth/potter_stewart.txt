just
as
a
matter
of
interest.
in
capital
cases,
is
a
view
often
denied?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
at
the
most
under
your
theory,
is
he
entitled
to
his
liberty
that
is
in
a
new
trial
or
is
he
entitled
now
that
have
an
appeal
for
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
no
trouble
about
the
transcripts
under
the
--
this
late
day?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
trouble
about
the
trial
transcript
this
late
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
you're
suggesting
something
else
by
what
you've
just
been
telling
us
after
the
time
of
this
interrogation.
in
other
words,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
inquiry,
aren't
you
suggesting
this?
this
man
was
tried
and
convicted
of
a
--
of
murder
and
he
could've
--
he
could've
been
sentenced
to
death.
he
was
not
and
its
--
we
all
know,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
offered
him
their
very
best
lawyers
in
the
world.
after
a
trial
like
that,
they
could
see
better
part
of
valor
not
to
take
an
appeal
because
of
the
rest
that
on
a
new
trial,
there
maybe
a
--
a
capital
--
there
maybe
a
conviction
that
will
lead
to
a
sentence
of
death.
and
that
this
man,
did
have
lawyers,
lawyers
of
his
own
choosing,
who
were
advising
him
and
that
--
that
it's
at
least
possible
that
they
advised
him
not
to
take
an
appeal.
that
would
at
least,
have
been
a
very
reasonable,
understandable
and
everyday
a
count
of
advice
to
give
in
that
situation.
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
suggesting
this
that
it
would
be
a
--
(inaudible)
state
of
the
law
if
the
person's
own
lawyers
told
him
and
advised
him
not
to
take
an
appeal
and
he
understood
the
wisdom
of
that
advice,
but
decided
he
drafts
to
play
on
both
ways
and
therefore
on
his
own,
decided
to
take
an
appeal
and
ask
the
court
to
appoint
a
lawyer
to
take
an
appeal.
if
that
were
denied,
he'd
get
a
--
he'd
have
two
bites
of
the
apple.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
senator
boothe,
one
of
the
things
that
isn't
at
all
simple
about
this
is
the
--
is
the
factual
issue
of
whether
or
not,
this
man
was
an
indigent.
he
certainly
does
not
allege
--
did
not
allege
in
1953
that
he
was
an
indigent.
he
simply
alleged
that
he
was
unable
to
make
arrangements
to
obtain
counsel.
and
on
appendix
page
4,
there
is
a
very
clear
indication
in
the
opinion
of
judge
hoffman
that
the
--
that
a
possible
reason
other
than
indigency
and
which
is
that
he
was
dissatisfied
with
his
trial
counsel.
that
claimed
to
the
state
bar
about
them.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
save
him
from
the
electric
chair.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
and
presumably
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
least
we
might
guess,
had
advised
him
not
to
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
that
might
have
been
pretty
good
advice,
don't
you
agree?
justice
potter
stewart
here's
here
--
this
isn't
a
husband
who
shot
a
paramour,
this
is
a
paramour
who
shot
a
husband.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
this?
justice
potter
stewart
is
your
claim
that
due
process
requires
a
compulsory
appeal
rep
--
with
representation
by
a
lawyer
or
merely
requires
a
lawyer's
advised
to
a
manners
had
been
convicted
as
to
whether
or
not
to
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
you
agree
as
a
lawyer
that
sometimes,
it
would
be
the
worst
advice
in
the
world
to
tell
a
man
to
appeal
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
case.
justice
potter
stewart
he
did.
he
did
have
a
trial
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
his
own
choosing.
justice
potter
stewart
senator
boothe,
before
you
leave
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
i'm
sorry
to
take
so
much
of
your
time,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
suggested
--
you
answered
his
question
that
you're
not
asking
for
this
man's
release
or
release
even
for
a
new
trial,
but
only
that
he
be
given
the
right
to
appeal
with
the
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
a
--
as
a
procedural
matter,
as
a
technical
matter,
is
this
the
can
or
--
or
a
habeas
corpus
in
the
--
under
virginia
law?
is
it
a
proper
function
of
that
writ
to
--
to
provide
that
kind
of
relief,
because
traditionally
and
ordinarily,
the
function
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
release
a
person
from
custody
only?
justice
potter
stewart
although
it
is
used
to
--
good
deal
just
to
bring
the
--
bring
the
body
into
court,
of
course
--(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
wondering
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
as
a
matter
of
virginia
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
can
--
can
a
habeas
corpus
provide
this
kind
of
a
more
subtle
or
more
refined
sort
of
relief
that
is
the
right
to
appeal
with
counsel
as
distinguished
from
release
from
custody
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
release
from
custody?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think,
it
could
be
used
in
this
way,
turn
him
loose
unless
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
until
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
given
--
