mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
some
great
disagreement
between
senator
boothe
and
myself
as
to
what
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is.
we
have
set
it
forth
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
it
is
the
green
brief
and
i'll
read
it,
because
i
think
it
is
the
controlling
matter
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
question
as
we
see
it
is
this,
is
a
person,
who
is
represented
by
counsel
of
his
own
choosing
in
a
state
court
and
who
is
convicted
of
a
capital
offense
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment,
entitled
to
have
the
court-appoint
counsel
upon
request
to
represent
him
for
the
purpose
of
appealing
his
conviction
in
the
absence
of
any
allegation
that
he
is
a
pauper
or
that
his
own
counsel
has
withdrawn
from
the
case.
it
is
important
to
note
that
petitioner
has
never,
in
any
of
the
enumerable
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
in
which
he
has
been
involved,
alleged,
stated,
or
suggested
that
he
was
without
funds
in
april
of
1953.
he's
never
said
he
was
indigent.
moreover,
he
has
never
made
any
allegation
that
any
error
occurred
during
the
trial
of
--
of
his
case.
the
record
before
this
court
and
before
the
state
courts
is
silent
on
this
question.
moreover,
there
is
no
affirmative
statement
contained
in
the
record
on
this
question.
what
is
the
history
of
this
man?
we
think
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
answer
to
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
this.
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
respondent
has
been
represented
by
counsel
in
a
court
proceeding
in
this
case.
the
history
of
this
case
is
this.
he
filed
his
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond,
that
is
equivalent
to
a
circuit
court.
judge
young,
one
of
the
three
judges
of
that
court,
appointed
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
the
attorney
looked
into
the
matter
and
filed
a
brief
of
some
type
with
judge
young.
in
virginia,
the
respondent,
state
superintendent
or
the
penitentiary,
by
counsel,
through
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
cannot
come
wondering
into
the
case
until
ordered
by
the
court.
we
can't
file
any
pleadings.
we're
not
permitted
to
until
an
order
to
show
cause
or
--
or
a
writ
is
issued.
we
don't
appear
and
cannot
appear.
so,
we
didn't
appear
in
that
case
at
all.
then
as
was
stated
yesterday,
writs
of
error
in
virginia
are
discretionary.
so,
there's
no
reason
--
we
have
no
idea
as
to
why
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
error
was
denied.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
we
could
not
have
come
into
the
case.
yes,
and
it
was
a
habeas
corpus
case,
we
could
not
come
into
it
until
such
time
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
so,
why
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
denied
the
writ?
i
don't
know.
i
could
think
of
several
reasons,
one
of
which
is
this,
and
it's
not
in
the
record,
it's
immaterial
but
the
law
and
equity
court
of
the
city
of
richmond
had
no
jurisdiction
than
attain
this
suit,
because
there
were
facts
not
matters
of
record
alleged
in
the
petition.
and
under
virginia
law,
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
which
alleges
facts
which
are
not
matters
of
record
must
be
filed
in
the
court
in
which
the
conviction
was
suffered.
so,
if
we
had
been
in
the
case,
we
would
have
immediately
moved
to
dismiss
it
on
the
grounds
of
law
and
equity
had
no
jurisdiction.
and
that
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir,
we
did
not.
i
did
not
file
the
response
that
was
requested
by
the
--
this
court.
it
was
filed
by
a
former
--
a
former
assistant
attorney
general
thomas
m.
miller,
who
is
no
longer
any
officer.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
didn't
raise
it.
i
would
have
frankly,
but
i
was
not
handling
the
volume
of
habeas
of
corpus
cases
at
the
time,
sir,
i've
been
assigned
since
the
first
amendment.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
think
we're
--
i
think
to
use
a
colloquial
expression,
your
honor,
we're
out
to
lunch
on
that
point.
we
had
it
--
i
just
called
up
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
the
essence
of
the
argument
in
a
--
in
a
matter
of
speaking,
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
original
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i'm
not.
i
don't
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
think
i
am
precluded,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
said
i
was
out
to
lunch
because
i
don't
feel
that
i
will
get
very
far
with
that
argument
quite
candidly,
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
a
much
stronger
argument
than
that
to
make,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
the
lack
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i
--
i
don't
know.
i
haven't
investigated
it
and
frank,
quite
candidly,
i
didn't
think
of
it
until
last
night.
so,
i'm
in
no
position
to
talk
too
much
about
it,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
until
the
question
--
it
hit
me
last
night,
your
honor,
in
going
over
this
case
that
law
and
equity
had
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
matter
as
originally
filed.
so
that
when
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
denied
the
petition
for
writ
of
error,
they
may
have
denied
on
the
grounds.
well,
judge
young
didn't
have
any
authority
to
enter
the
order
or
to
write
the
opinion
because
mr.
newsom
filed
in
the
wrong
court.
moreover,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
mr.
newsom
is
a
busy
little
man
and
while
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
pending
in
this
court,
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
found
in
judge
young
--
young's
court.
and
while
his
present
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
--
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
in
this
case,
was
pending
in
this
court,
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
coram
vobis
in
the
hustings
court
for
the
city
of
richmond
part
ii.
so
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
you
--
the
original
petition
for
a
writ
of
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
was
denied
by
the
hustings
court
for
the
city
of
richmond
part
ii
and
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
denied
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
error
in
that
case.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir,
but
we
put
it
in
our
appendix.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
to
consi
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
that
section
8-596
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
let's
see
where
we
are
now.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
--
according
to
the
files
in
the
office
of
the
attorney
general,
no
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
has
been
filed
in
that
case,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
was
denied
by
the
hustings
court
for
the
city
of
richmond
part
ii
on
april
28,
1960.
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
error
was
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
on
--
on
october
10,
1960.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
to
continue
that,
the
--
the
code
section
in
question
on
this
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
sir,
is
section
8-596
of
the
code
of
virginia,
1950.
as
amended,
you
will
find
it
in
the
packet
part.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
8-596,
it's
in
the
packet
part,
sir.
i
think
that's
the
section.
i
have
to
double
check
it.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it's
the
code
of
virginia.
the
code
of
virginia
is
in
--
is
in
nine
volumes
and
an
index,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that's
in
volume
2,
to
be
exact.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct
sir.
and
as
i
told
the
court,
i
didn't
think
of
the
question
until
last
night,
sir.
i
slipped
up
quite
candidly,
sir.
the
--
to
continue,
then
the
--
we've
listed
on
pages
2
through
4
of
our
brief,
the
chronological
history
of
this
man's
efforts
to
secure
his
relief
and
have
included
as
appendix
2,
the
opinion
of
judge
walter
hoffman,
the
district
judge,
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
norfolk
division
of
april
10,
1958,
which
gives
a
rather
thorough,
complete
and
exhaustive
history
of
this
man's
efforts.
he
was
tried
on
the
charge
of
murder.
he'd
been
having
a
list
of
relations
with
another
man's
wife
and
when
she
rejected
him,
he
shot
her
husband.
he
was
represented
by
two
attorneys
of
his
own
choosing
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
this
--
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
before
this
court
that
those
two
attorneys
ever
withdrew
from
the
case,
after
it
was
tried
in
the
trial
court.
no
indication
whatsoever.
and
mr.
newsom
has
never
alleged
that
he
discharged
them.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
--
they
--
and
newsom
did
not
start
appearing
pro
se
your
honor,
until
1956,
when
he
filed
his
first
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
alleging
that
there
were
only
11
jurors
on
the
jury
that
heard
his
case.
now
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
that
is
--
i
beg
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
the
two
attorneys
who
represented
him
at
his
original
trial
were
selected
and
employed
by
mr.
newsom.
they
were
not
court-appointed
attorneys.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
this
is
a
different
proceeding.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
now
that
--
that
isn't
what
that
letter
says,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
didn't
say
his
lawyer,
it
says,
with
an
attorney.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
with
an
attorney.
that's
--
that's
a
little
different.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
correct,
sir.
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
noted
his
appeal
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
noted
his
appeal
and
said
he
couldn't
make
arrangements
with
--
for
an
attorney.
what
that
means,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i'm
addressing
myself
to
this
your
honor.
i'm
attempting
to
show
by
showing
the
history
of
this
man's
efforts,
to
show
first,
that
all
his
--
that
his
efforts
have
been
frivolous,
that
this
petition
is
plainly
frivolous.
and
to
show
further
that
the
man
had
--
did
have
a
fair
trial
and
you'll
find
that
the
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
which
is
printed,
as
appendix
3
in
our
brief,
indicates
that,
as
well
as
judge
--
judge
hoffman's
memorandum
opinion.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
what
you
can
read
into
the
petition
for
a
writ
which
he
filed
your
honor,
but
that
isn't
what
his
contention
as
set
forth
in
his
petition
on
this.
that
is
not
his
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
which
this
proceeding
is
based,
your
honor.
that's
not
what
it's
--
that's
not
what
he
put
in
there,
at
all.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
alright,
your
honor,
just
a
second,
if
i
may.
he
says
this
on
page
4
of
the
record
or
page
11
of
our
green
brief,
his
contention
is
this,
"petitioner
was
denied
due
process
of
law
and
equal
protection,
when
hustings
court
part
ii
of
the
city
of
richmond
denied
him
an
appeal
from
its
judgment
rendered
on
the
10th
day
of
april,
1953
and
in
that
failing
to
aid
sufficiently,
they
attended
appeals
of
the
appellant."
it
doesn't
say
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
those
are
the
two
letters,
sir.
the
one
noting
appeal
your
honor
and
the
second
one
saying,
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
due
to
circumstances,
i
won't
able
to
make
arrangements.
now,
i
don't
what
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
asked
for
an
attorney.
he
had
no
question
about
that.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i'd
--
it's
not
in
the
record
but
the
--
it's
obvious
that
this
man
got
a
lucky
break,
frankly.
the
record
shows
--
it
shows
the
type
of
crime
which
he
committed,
but
the
--
i'm
also
addressing
myself
on
that
one
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
i
think
this
man
has
been
tried,
has
been
biting
at
the
apple
since
1956,
trying
to
get
out
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
would
say
that
he
would
be
barred,
but
there's
one
factor
that
i
think,
your
honor
left
out
of
that
question
that
i
should
like
to
supply
if
i
may,
because
we
ran
into
this
very
situation,
not
two
months
ago,
with
a
habeas
corpus
case.
suppose
he
can't
get
an
attorney
and
suppose
no
attorney
will
take
the
case
because
he
says,
there's
patently
no
error
in
the
record.
where
does
that
leave
you?
we
had
a
recent
habeas
corpus
case
involving
an
indigent,
the
court-appointed
a
very
fine
attorney.
the
man
looked
into
and
he
talked
to
his
client,
he
had
coverage
with
the
court
with
the
petitioner
present
and
his
lawyers
said,
"i'm
--
i'm
court-appointed
but
i
cannot
honestly
argue
this
proposition
because
it's
--
you're
obviously
wrong
and
the
man
was
ignorant
and
you
just
couldn't
explain
it
to
him,"
the
question
involved
figuring
the
--
whether
he
was
serving
third
time,
half
time
or
flat
time,
good
time
or
bad
time,
in
a
state
penitentiary.
what
do
you
do
in
that
case?
i
think
that
--
that
due
process
would
not
include
the
right
of
a
man
to
have
an
attorney
when
the
attorney
says
obviously.
an
expert
attorney
says,
"there's
no
error
in
this
record."
it's
a
clear-cut
case.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
to
continue
then,
if
i
may
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
end
to
--
i
didn't
tell
the
complete
story
on
this
recent
case
which
will
answer
part
of
your
question,
sir.
we
never
had
to
reach
the
determination
which
this
court,
which
you
--
of
the
question
which
you
asked
me,
sir,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
for
the
reason
that
while
the
matter
was
pending,
the
man
escaped
from
the
state
farm
and
we
haven't
caught
him
yet,
so
the
case
has
been
dismissed.
but
in
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think
that
you're
reading
a
great
deal
into
this
very
short
letter,
which
the
petitioner
wrote.
now,
i
hold
him
right
strict
to
his
words,
because
he
is
one
of
the
finest
con
lawyers
we've
got,
incarcerated
in
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
today.
and
he's
not
a
dumb
fellow
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination,
he's
been
in
watch
before
for
murder
and
was
pardoned.
so
he
knows
what
the
score
is.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it's
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
you'll
find
it
in
the
opinion.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
would
concede
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
insofar
as
any
other
facts
are
concerned,
they
are
pure
supposition
and
i
cannot
concede
any
other
fact
from
the
fact
that
he
wanted
a
lawyer.
now,
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
point
out
one
thing
at
this
point,
which
is
in
our
brief,
it
is
not
overly
emphasized
but
it
is
in
there
and
i
think
it's
important.
if
you
examine
the
court
order
which
appears
on
pages
11
and
12
of
this
record
and
count
the
number
of
jurors,
there
are
only
11
jurors
on
that
--
on
that
list.
this
man
is
not
now
detained
under
this
order.
and
detained
under
the
order
entered
in
the
nunc
pro
tunc
proceeding
held
in
november
of
1956,
which
put
the
name
of
duncan
on
that
list.
he
was
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel
in
the
nunc
pro
tunc
proceeding.
he
was
an
indigent
at
the
time.
he
asked
the
court
to
appoint
an
attorney
to
assist
him
an
appeal
--
in
appealing
his
case.
one
was
appointed
and
was
later
discharged.
mr.
harlan,
ruby
was
appointed
to
represent
him
on
appeal.he
was
later
discharged
by
the
petitioner
in
writing.
the
petitioner
is
now
detained
in
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
on
that
order.
he
had
an
appeal
from
that
order.
he
is
not
detained
under
this
order
which
contains
only
11
names.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
would
think
that
there's
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
coming
up
on
another.
in
fact,
i
will
guarantee
you
practically
that
he
will
serve,
if
he
loses
here.
he's
got
a
long
time
to
go
and
he's
going
to
keep
right
on
filing,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
habeas
corpus
may
not
be
renewed
on
the
same
point.
the
judgment
is
conclusive,
under
8-605
of
the
code.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
can
go
back
and
start
all
over
again.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
can
go
back
to
the
right
court
and
start
all
over
again.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
the
allegation
in
that
proceeding
was
this,
he
alleged
that
they
were
--
that
he
was
tried
by
a
jury,
consisting
of
only
11
jurors.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
resulted
in
this.
it
resulted
first,
in
the
matter
being
state
pending
the
outcome
of
the
case
of
counsel
versus
commonwealth,
which
involved
that
very
question
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
in
the
fall
of
1956,
then,
they
nunc
pro
tunc
him.
that,
he
appealed
that
and
dropped
that
appeal.
then
he
filed
--
then
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
heard.
that
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
writ
of
error
was
denied,
it
came
to
this
court.
writ
of
certiorari
was
denied.
it
went
to
judge
hoffman
in
norfolk.
he
denied
it
without
a
hearing
with
the
memorandum
opinion,
which
is
found
on
appendix
2.
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
appointed
a
couple
of
attorneys
to
represent
him,
he
then
had
a
hearing
there.
he
lost
there,
that
is
--
the
opinion
of
that
court
is
printed
in
our
appendix,
then
he
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
and
while
that
petition
was
pending,
he
filed
this
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
law
and
equity
courts.
that
gives
you
a
--
a
brief
rundown
of
these
several
efforts
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
of
his
original
conviction?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
he
asked
for
an
attorney
to
appeal
the
nunc
pro
tunc
case
that
he
lost,
brought
by
the
state
of
commonwealth
of
virginia.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
he
asked
for
a
--
he
asked
the
same
judge,
judge
douglas
now,
who
tried
him.
he
said,
"judge,
i
don't
have
any
money,
i
want
an
attorney."
the
record
shows,
he
was
indigent.
and
judge
douglas
immediately
appointed
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
now,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
case
at
bar,
from
his
original
conviction,
there's
no
indication
that
he
was
indigent.
and
i
have
very
carefully
examined
all
of
the
papers
ever
filed
of
which
we
have
copies
which
is
everything
by
this
gentleman.
and
he's
never
said
that
in
april
of
1953,
he
was
indigent.
the
first
person
who
ever
suggested
that
was
my
good
friend,
senator
boothe
here
and
he
assumed
it.
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
nice
assumption,
but
it's
not
going
out
by
the
record.
the
record
doesn't
show
what
his
financial
condition
was.
and
for
that
reason,
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
merit
to
the
suggestion
made
by
counsel
for
petitioner
before
this
court.
and
mr.
newsom
was
broke
without
funds
in
april
of
1953.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
it.
now,
maybe
if
he
had
a
hearing,
it
might
be
something
different.
of
course,
if
we
had
a
hearing,
we
could've
looked
in
to
see
where
his
outside
bank
account
is,
because
of
couple
of
times
going
to
govern,
filing
his
petition,
took
all
his
money
out
and
put
it
somewhere
else.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
a
hearing
in
the
state
court,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
a
hearing
in
the
state
court.
that
might've
--
if
--
if
had
not
been
an
ex
parte
proceeding
have
gotten
in
the
right
pew,
over
in
the
hustings
court
part
ii,
then
we
would
have
it
in
--
we
have
a
record,
frankly.
and
we
have
no
record
in
this
case,
when
you
get
down
to
it.
there's
very
little
in
the
record.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that's
what
senator
boothe
says.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
opinion
says
this,
sir.
and
i
have
quoted
a
small
portion
of
it
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
judge
young
says
this,
"the
facts
recited
must
be
accepted
as
true
in
ascertaining
whether
probable
cause
has
been
shown,
or
to
the
effect
that
shortly
after
conviction,
petitioner
made
known
his
desire
to
fit
--
to
petition
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia
for
writ
of
error
and
requested
the
trial
court
to
appoint
an
attorney
to
handle
the
matter,
which
was
not
done."
those
are
the
facts
which
judge
young
recites
in
his
opinion.
that
could
be
found
on
page
12
of
our
brief
and
page
23
of
the
printed
record.
that's
what
judge
--
that's
what
judge
young
used
as
a
basis.
and
of
course,
when
he
got
into
the
question
of
appointing
counsel,
he
had
to
go
and
manage
some
cases.
i
know
of
no
other
cases
that
hold
that
you've
got
to
appoint
counsel
period,
except
in
the
case
of
an
indigent.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct,
sir.
but
he's
talking
about
the
facts
as
he's
got
them.
and
he
doesn't
have
any
information.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
think
he's
done
some
assuming
your
honor,
quite
candidly.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
don't
know
what
he
premised
his
decision
on,
your
honor.
it's
hard
to
say,
because
he
says
in
his
opinion
that
the
facts
--
i
accept
are
those
which
were
recited.
and
the
recited
facts
make
no
mention
of
the
man's
financial
condition.
if
this
was
--
if
he
was
an
indigent,
have
he
--
if
--
if
newsom
had
been
an
indigent
in
april
1953,
and
he
told
the
judge
so
and
the
record
so
indicated
before
this
court,
we
have
an
entirely
different
case,
as
we
see
it.
but
there's
no
clear
cut
case
before
this
court,
there's
no
clear
cut
constitutional
question.
this
is
not
the
case
of
an
indigent,
ignorant
man
being
convicted
and
desiring
an
appeal.
this
is
not
that
case
at
all.
this
is
the
case
of
a
man
represented
by
his
own
attorneys.
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
indigent
or
not.
we
know
he's
an
able
man
as
an
attorney.
you've
only
got
to
look
at
pages
2
through
4
of
our
brief
and
see
what
he's
filed
so
far
and
he
hasn't
done
badly.
he
hasn't
won
anything
yet,
but
he's
getting
better
and
better.
he's
finally
gotten
here
in
the
highest
court
of
the
united
states.
he's
no
--
no
ignorant
person,
at
all.
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
the
case
at
all
of
a
--
of
the
ignorant
indigent.
we
have
a
confused
situation,
frankly,
a
very
confused
situation
and
it
does
not
present
a
--
a
constitutional
question
as
suggested
by
my
good
friend,
senator
boothe
in
a
clear
cut,
concrete
or
in
sided
form.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
would
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
should
be
dismissed,
as
improvidently
that
would
for
lack
of
the
proper
record,
for
this
reason
that
the
--
the
situation
facing
us
today,
i
think
is
this.
you
have
a
--
a
filed
up
record
and
although
i
am
very
young
at
the
bar
and
a
neophyte
when
one
gets
down
to
it,
i
have
never
felt
that
a
court
should
determine
a
case
on
facts
which
are
not
recited.
i've
never
felt
that
we
can
assume
anything
in
making
a
decision.
indeed
in
this
case,
all
the
assumptions
if
any
need
be
made
are
against
petitioner's
suggestions
because
the
record
clearly
negates
his
financial
condition
that's
signed.
the
record
negates
also
any
allegation
had
he
made
one,
which
he
did
not.
that
there
was
--
that
there
were
any
errors
committed
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
so
the
question
if
any
would
be
this,
you've
got
man,
we
don't
know
if
he's
indigent
or
not,
he
makes
no
allegation
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
were
any
errors
in
the
case,
moreover,
the
previous
opinions
of
federal
courts,
two
of
them,
in
fact
indicate
that
the
man
had
a
full
and
fair
trial.
and
there
was
nothing
wrong.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
so,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
should
make
any
decision
on
the
constitutional
question
purportedly
raised
by
my
friend
senator
boothe
in
his
brief.
if
--
if
the
courts
--
if
we
must
have
a
case
like
that,
i
can
assure
the
court,
there
are
plenty
of
them
coming
up
because
six
of
them
have
gone
over
my
desk
in
the
past
six
weeks.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
oh,
no.
this
is
not
the
argue
and
the
right
to
have
an
appeal.
he
could've
appealed
the
case
himself,
when
he
wanted
to
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
don't
know
about
that.
he's
a
very
good
appeal
man,
your
honor.
after
all,
he's
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
he's
been
through
here.
this
is
his
third
trip
to
this
court,
your
honor.
this
is
his
third
trip
through
here.
he's
been
through
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
a
couple
of
times
for
the
circuit
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
[laughs]
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i'm
frank
to
state
that
i
had
not
devoted
a
great
deal
of
time
preparing
for
that
particular
question
because
i
don't
think
it's
raised
by
the
record,
but
i
would
say
this
that
in
this
particular
case,
in
this
particular
man,
with
his
ableness
as
an
attorney,
manifest
on
the
record
that
in
this
case,
the
court
did
not
have
to
appoint
an
attorney
to
represent
him.
now,
it
is
perhaps
valid
that
the
state
should
have
some
type
of
procedure,
whether
it
be
a
certificate
of
probable
cause,
set
up
as,
i
understand
the
federal
government
has
something
along
those
lines
so
that
if
a
man
wanted
to
appeal,
an
attorney
could
be
appointed
to
at
least
investigate
it
and
read
some
sort
of
determination
as
to
the
merits
of
his
contentions
or
see
if
there
is
an
error
of
the
face
of
the
record
or
even
in
the
transcript,
if
there'd
be
one.
some
setup
perhaps,
should
be
provided.
i
don't
know
that
if
--
that
you've
got
to
appoint
an
attorney
to
carry
it
all
the
way
out.
there
should
be
some
way
that
it
could
be
handled
to
avoid
that
very
situation,
for
this
reason
that
if
--
if
the
court
should
hold
--
furthermore,
if
the
court
should
hold
for
instance,
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
have
an
attorney,
an
indigent
male,
the
man
is
clearly
broke,
clearly
without
funds,
if
he
is
entitled
to
have
an
attorney
to
represent
him
on
appeal,
the
court
should
hold
that
now,
what
do
we
do?
there
are
approximately
125,000
people
incarcerated
in
the
penitentiaries
of
this
country
today,
roughly.
about
6000
in
virginia
alone
and
the
--
the
result
of
such
a
decision
if
it
be
made
retroactive
as
it
was,
would
be
horrendous
in
the
state
courts
anyway.
i
don't
know
what
would
happen.
i'm
frank
to
say,
the
--
as
the
assistant
attorney
general
of
virginia
signed
to
the
overseeing
of
all
habeas
corpus
cases,
the
--
an
idea
goes
to
the
entire
penal
system
including
31
road
camps,
2
state
farms
and
a
state
penitentiary
for
a
--
a
new
ground
for
relief,
takes
roughly
three
days,
we
figured
it.
before
the
time
the
first
petition
comes
in,
alleging
the
particular
matter
until
we
get
one
from
the
farthest
road
camp
away.
so,
this
is
the
spectrum
which
disturbs
me
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
in
the
holding
of
that
type.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i
would
say
this.
here's
a
situation
on
this
record,
with
these
letters.
if
these
letters
are
sufficient
now,
if
these
letters
are
sufficient
your
honor,
let
me
put
this
case
before
the
court.
you
have
a
man
who's
--
who
was
convicted
we'll
say,
25
years
ago,
at
the
age
of
17,
represented
by
a
competent
counsel.
a
first
degree
murder
of
say,
three
or
four
people
for
heinous
crimes
and
put
away
for
the
rest
of
his
natural
life,
25
years
have
now
gone
by
and
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
writes
an
opinion
and
says,
"a
man
is
--
a
man
is
entitled
to
have
counsel
on
appeal."
and
he
comes
in
to
the
--
the
courts
in
the
state
of
virginia
and
files
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
says,
"i
was
denied
an
appeal."
and
we
say,
what
the
records
sound,
we
don't
have
any
court
--
official
court
reporters
in
virginia
now,
so
it
has
to
be
in
the
final
judgment
order
of
conviction.
the
record's
silent,
everybody's
dead,
whoever
had
anything
to
do
with
the
case.
and
he
says,
well
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
i
had
not
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
had
not
plan
to
discuss
it,
your
honor,
quite
candidly
at
any
length
because
of
the
state
of
the
record,
sir,
but
in
--
if
you
assume
an
indigent
and
assume
that
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
assume
that
there
were
errors
in
the
record,
you've
got
to
make
that
assumption,
i
think.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
if
you
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
i'm
--
i've
been
trying
to
answer
it,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
if
you
assume
all
those
things,
then
you
reach
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
a
man
is
entitled
to
anything
beyond
a
fair
trial
in
a
state
court.
now,
there
are
no
decided
federal
and
no
decision
of
this
court
on
that
question
at
all.
the
--
does
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
then,
extend
beyond
the
trial
itself?
does
it
extend
into
the
appeal
period
is
what
you're
asking
me?
the
appeal
proceeding
is
not
a
part
of
the
trial.
it
is
not
a
prosecution
brought
by
the
state
of
virginia.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
it
--
it
switches
around.
if
--
if
he
is
--
if
he
is
convicted
in
virginia
of
first
degree
murder
and
desires
to
appeal,
he
files
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
error
and
this
case
would've
been
style
stuart
newsom,
plaintiff
in
error,
versus
the
commonwealth
of
virginia,
defender
in
error.
it's
an
entirely
new
proceeding.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it's
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
oh,
yes,
sir.
set
--
yes,
sir,
sentence
can
be
imposed
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
can
be.
it
can
be
put
under
bond
and
if
the
local
court
won't
put
him
under
bond,
he
may
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
let
me
--
what
i
was
saying
was
this,
sir.
if
--
if
the
lower
court
refuses
to
bond
him,
then
the
supreme
court
feels
can
bond
him,
if
they
want
to,
but
it
goes
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia.
he
files
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
error
against
the
state.
it's
not
a
prosecution
brought
by
the
state
against
him.
it
is
an
effort
by
a
person
who
is
convicted
in
a
separate
proceeding
to
secure
an
adjudication
of
the
--
of
his
trial.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir,
because
the
record
goes
on
out
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
but
it's
a
new
proceeding.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
it
depends
on
how
it's
reversed.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
to
reverse,
to
remand
it
for
a
new
trial,
yes,
sir
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
then
they
take
him
back
and
they
try
him
all
over
again.
it's
very
seldom
you
ever
see
one
where
the
--
it's
reversed
in
the
matters
dismissed,
i
don't
think
i've
seen
one
in
the
four
and
a
half
years
i've
been
in
the
attorney
general's
office,
sir.
but
if
it
is
reversed
on
a
factual
situation
and
quite
often
the
commonwealth's
attorney
will
look
and
say,
"well,
i
got
this
here,
say
evidence
in
first
time
but
not
this
time
and
(inaudible)
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir,
for
this
reason
that
he
still
got
the
right
to
do
it
himself.
he
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
still
has
the
right
to
file
his
own
appeal
if
he
wants
to
and
the
prisoners
in
the
penitentiary
are
brought
over
every
time
a
court,
three
to
six
at
a
time
and
carried
into
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
and
their
petitions
for
writs
of
error
and
habeas
corpus
cases,
coram
vobis
and
original
convictions
are
heard.
but
i
think
this,
i
think
that
we
miss
one
point
in
this
case
and
that
is
this
that
in
virginia,
insofar
as
we
can
tell
from
the
commonwealth
side,
if
a
man
is
indigent
and
is
wrongly
convicted,
his
attorney,
who
was
appointed
by
the
court,
will
bring
the
case
up
himself
without
anybody
asking
him
to
other
than
--
other
than
the
man
who
was
convicted.
and
we've
had
three
during
the
past
four
months,
one
of
them
was
reversed
and
the
other
two
were
not.
you've
got
to
assume
some
good
faith
along
the
line
somewhere
and
we
have
found
that
in
virginia,
our
attorneys
come
on
up
with
the
indigent
and
filed
the
petition
for
writ
of
error
but
in
any
event,
that
is
not
too
material
to
this
proceeding.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
this
request
was
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
not
made
--
to
the
supreme
court,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
was
back
in
1953,
which
was
before
i
started
practicing
law,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
--
i
couldn't
answer
that
question
honestly.
the
only
thing
i
can
point
to
is
this,
and
that
is
the
nunc
pro
tunc
proceeding
which
resulted
in
the
order
under
which
we're
now
holding
this
matter,
was
tried
by
the
same
judge
that
tried
him
original
and
in
that
case
where
he
was
clearly
and
said
so,
an
attorney
was
immediately
appointed.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
problems.
the
--
another
problem
is
this.
where
are
you
going
to
get
the
record
from?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
now,
in
--
in
discussing
the
so-called
merits
of
the
case,
we
assumed
many
things
which
were
not
in
this
record.
we
had
to
assume
that
there
was
no
error
in
the
case.
we
had
to
assume
he
was
indigent.
we
had
to
assume
he
wanted
an
attorney.
now,
to
conclude,
i
would
say
this,
that
we
can't
assume
any
of
those
things.
the
record
is
silent
as
to
his
financial
condition.
the
record
shows
conclusively
that
he
is
expert
in
appellate
proceedings.
the
fourth
circuit
opinion
as
well
as
that
of
judge
hoffman
indicates
that
he
had
a
full
and
fair
trial,
so
there
were
no
errors
in
the
trial
and
he
doesn't
allege
any
errors.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
was
a
petition
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
before
judge
hoffman
was
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
filed
by
the
petitioner,
in
answer
of
the
respondent.
plus,
the
court
orders
involved
in
the
original
trial,
the
habeas
corpus
had
nunc
pro
tunc
proceedings.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
my
recollection
is
it
took
one
day,
your
honor.
it
was
rather
a
simple
case.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
except
for
the
fact,
your
honor
that
judge
doubles,
who
tried
the
original
case,
took
the
time
to
write
down
a
testimony
of
several
of
the
witnesses
after
the
trial
was
over
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
and
had
it
signed
by
the
--
by
the
different
attorneys.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
was
before
judge
hoffman.
you'll
find
that
noted
in
his
memoranda
opinion,
sir.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
who
signed
for
newsom?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
smyth
and
smyth.
there
were
two
smyths
who
represented
him,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
was
--
that
was
the
date
of
the
letter.
now,
what
did
the
letter
--
when
the
letter
got
to
the
judge,
we
don't
know
because
sometimes
it
takes
about
two
days
to
get
it
out
of
the
penitentiary.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
says
that
the
letter
is
dated,
it
doesn't
say
it
was
received,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
letter
was
sent
to
judge
doubles
in
hustings
court
part
ii,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
went
through
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
virginia,
your
honor,
when
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
went
through.
they've
seen
it.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
let
me
think,
which
--
which
--
when
was
the
most
pending.
now,
it
went
through
--
on
the
first
habeas
corpus
to
the
state
courts,
not
the
second
and
also
was
up
here
for
the
coram
vobis
proceedings.
now,
in
--
to
sum
up
then,
we
would
say
that
the
record
is
silent
as
--
as
to
his
financial
condition.
the
record
indicates
he
had
a
fair
trial.
he
certainly
has
waited
a
long
time
to
raise
this
particular
point.
he's
tried
everything
else.
and
the
record
before
this
court,
does
not
present
a
constitutional
question
as
suggested
by
senator
boothe,
in
a
form
whereby
this
court
can
decide.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you.
