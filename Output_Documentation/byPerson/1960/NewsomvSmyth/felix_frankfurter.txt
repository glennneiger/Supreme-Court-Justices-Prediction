justice

frankfurter
mr.
boothe,
may
i
govern
you
to
go
back
a
minute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
from
the
original
conviction,
which
was
in
1953
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
original
conviction,
there
was
no
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
wouldn't
have
to
tell
us
if
there
are
any
circumstances
that
were
spelled
out
in
detail
but
we
--
he
had
a
lawyer
up
to
the
time
of
the
--
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
--
in
your
--
in
the
commonwealth,
what
--
if
he
told
that
he
has
the
right
of
appeal
by
--
by
his
lawyer,
if
he
has
one,
or
by
the
court
if
he's
--
hasn't
got
one
and
need
not
to
have
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
knew
he
had
a
right
of
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
that's
a
very
important
qualification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statement
it
was
an
appeal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
asked
--
he
knew
he
had
a
right
of
appeal.
he
wanted
to
appeal.
he
asked
for
assistance
to
appeal,
to
enable
him
to
appeal
and
that
was
denied,
and
therefore
i
should
think
in
order
to
call
without
any
therefore
causes
such
a
subtle
thing
in
this
world.
and
the
next
step
was
that
there
was
no
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
this
was
not
voluntary
--
whether
justifiably
understood
or
not,
this
was
not
a
voluntary
abstention
from
an
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
boothe,
when
did
--
when
in
the
history
of
your
calendar
appealability
--
was
appealability
a
matter
of
right
either
in
capital
cases
alone
or
in
cases
of
severe
offenses?
what
--
what
is
the
history?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
court,
the
trial
court
or
the
appellate
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
in
the
cases
of
murder,
you've
got
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
automatic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
indigent
in
determining
that
but
we
have
no
question
of
whether
the
man
is
really
an
indigent.
it's
all
by
leave
of
court,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
going
back
to
is
that,
is
any
opportunity
for
appeal
in
--
in
virginia
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
any
appeal.
always
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
true
as
to
all
offense
--
that
has
been
true
as
to
all
--
i
don't
mean
the
--
the
belief
that
it
isn't
automatic.
but
was
there
an
opportunity
even
for
discretionary
review
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
don't
mean
in
this
case.
i
mean
in
--
as
a
matter
of
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
see,
because
in
many
--
in
--
in
some
states,
there
was
no
appeal
at
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
always
a
matter
of
constitute
--
well,
i
suppose
i
know
from
the
decision
of
this
court
that
the
state
doesn't
have
to
give
the
right
of
appeal
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
in
the
federal
courts
and
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
curious
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
put
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
a
variant
or
carry
out
brother
harlan's
question.
as
i
understood
you
and
it
interests
me
enormously
--
as
i
understood
you,
appeal
is
by
leave
of
the
court
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
on
that
application
or
motion
or
whatever
you
call
it
technically
down
there,
the
(inaudible)
is
heard
orally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
the
opponent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
put
the
case
of
this
--
of
newsom,
himself
pro
se
appearing
before
your
supreme
court
and
stating
the
ground
on
which
he
wanted.
and
then
your
bench
--
five
or
seven
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
seven?
justice
felix
frankfurter
seven
of
them
examining
him
and
questioning
him
in
order
to
decide
whether
they
should
give
him
leave
and
should
then
appoint
counsel.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
--
if
they
allowed
him
to
appear
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
say
for
these
and
these
reasons,
i
want
your
honors
to
dispense
me
an
opportunity
to
have
this
case
argued
on
the
merits,
but
that
preliminary
statement
--
there's
a
preliminary
statement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
at
which
the
appellant,
the
potential
appellant
may
state
reasons
for
asking
the
court
to
allow
him
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'm
supposing
that
he
was
allowed
to
come
in
the
--
we're
dealing
with
the
future
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
a
convicted
prisoner
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
allowed
to
stay
to
the
court
of
appeals
why
he
should
be
allowed
to
have
the
appeal
prosecuted
on
the
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
he's
got
no
--
he
couldn't
have
agreed
with
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
supposing
they
hear
him
and
--
on
the
basis
of
the
solicitor's
examination
from
the
bench
they
prepared
together
and
(inaudible)
to
say
whether
this
is
--
there's
nothing
in
it.
there's
a
variance
on
what
justice
harlan
concluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
if
they're
really
--
the
court
of
appeals
itself
makes
an
investigation
of
that
kind
indicated
to
determine
whether
they
should
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
he's
brought
out
problem
--
it
has
brought
out
difficulties
that
sua
sponte,
the
court
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
your
--
under
your
statute
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
capital
cases,
the
counsel
feed
by
the
state
or
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
total
(voice

justice
felix
frankfurter
a
day,
hundred
dollars
a
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
the
whole
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
that's
today
or
10
days
or
2
weeks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
under
the
theory
of
this
quote
that
every
lawyer
has
a
duty
to
his
profession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
circumstances
the
jury
has
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
that?
i
didn't
get
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
got
--
have
you
got
--
i
suppose
you
have
appellate
procedural
problem
that's
comparable
to
some
of
those
that
we
have
here.
what
is
open,
what
has
been
opened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
stenographic
notes
in
existence
so
far
as
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
not
taken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
is
it
a
statutory
or
a
common
law
practice
as
it
would
to
have
a
stenographer
person?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
judge
takes
--
the
trial
judge
takes
copious
notes,
does
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
infer
from
what
senator
boothe
said
yesterday
that
on
the
application
or
whatever
it's
called,
to
--
on
leave
of
appeal,
the
grand
jury
writ
of
error
in
the
supreme
court,
thereto
the
state
--
the
commonwealth
was
not
represented
and
couldn't
be
represented
until
that
discretionary
writ
was
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
--
either
in
the
nisi
court
or
on
--
in
the
appellate
tribunal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
file
--
did
you
--
in
response
to
the
--
to
the
petitions
in
this
court,
did
virginia
raise
this
local
procedural
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
--
what
do
you
say
to
that,
mr.
harp?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
argument
that
is
implied
in
your
answer
namely,
that
if
the
state
is
represented
by
one
lawyer
who
doesn't
raise
a
local
procedural
point
and
the
case
is
brought
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
are
you
now
suggesting
that
you
are
not
bound
or
you
are
not
barred
rather,
from
raising
a
procedural
question
which
deprived
this
court
of
jurisdiction?
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
--
he's
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
the
opposite.
you
said
you
were
not
concluded
--
precluded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
can't
imagine,
speaking
for
one
person,
you
have
a
stronger
argument
in
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
in
this
case
and
any
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
coram
nobis
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
here
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
case
is
not
--
we
cannot
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pass
--
we
can't
adjudicate
that
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore,
speaking
for
myself,
assuming
you've
said
all
there
is
to
be
said,
i
hope
senator
boothe
will
address
himself
because
if
it's
--
if
it's
demonstrable,
not
questionable
or
ambiguous,
but
if
it's
demonstrable
that
the
lower
court
had
--
that
--
that
this
is
a
case
which
was
barred
from
consideration
by
a
virtue
of
the
procedural
limitations
of
virginia
courts
and
therefore,
there
is
necessarily
a
state
ground
and
speaking
for
one
member
of
the
court,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
because
the
case
--
the
judgement
then
must
rest
unless
we
have
explicitness
of
the
contrary
on
that
local
ground,
and
i
hope
senator
boothe
will
say
something
about
that
and
come
from
his
rebuttal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
other
case
still
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
coram
nobis
case
still
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
potential.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
when
was
it
--
when
was
it
denied?
i
want
to
know
if
it's
still
alive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
october,
november,
december,
that's
three
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
--
may
i
trouble
you
again,
may
i
trouble
you
again
for
the
figures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
penal
code?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
them
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say,
withdrew,
you
mean
that
they
affirmatively
asked
the
court
to
relieve
them
of
defending.
we
haven't
got
in
the
record
the
facts
of
newsom
appeared
pro
se.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
purposes
of
this
litigation,
if
he
had
pro
se
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
would
mean
that
even
though
those
lawyers
have
still
been
willing
to
be
called
on
or
were
under
obligation
perhaps,
by
virtue
of
the
appointment
by
the
court,
he
chose
to
represent
himself.
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
event,
that
raises
a
question
which
i
hope
we
don't
--
i
don't
have
to
decide
is
whether
if
a
man
in
fact
has
a
lawyer,
can
he
trial
pleadings
in
his
own
name?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
--
to
what
point,
are
you
now
addressing
yourself
by
stating
these
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
frivolous
you
mean
that
on
the
face
of
it,
it's
--
it's
saying
that
2
and
3,
it
was
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
claim
that
he
doesn't
make
--
and
he
didn't
make
on
the
basis
of
which
this
writ
was
issued,
was
that
he
asked
--
he
had
no
lawyer.
he
didn't
make
that
--
that
does
appear
does
it
not
in
the
papers?
that
he
said
--
at
one
--
at
some
point
rather,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
the
1953
letter,
you
can
interpret
it
the
way
you
like.
at
some
point
or
rather
he
did
say,
i
have
--
i
want
to
appeal,
i
gave
notice
of
appeal
but
wanted
an
appeal,
but
i
had
no
lawyer
who
would
press
that
desire
on
my
part,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
contention,
you
mean
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
--
does
the
document
have
if
you
will?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
can
a
defendant
--
can
a
prisoner
reject
the
advice
of
--
assume
this,
assume,
assume
that
due
process
does
impose
upon
the
states
the
duty
to
supply
a
lawyer
to
an
indigent
--
indigently
convicted
defendant
in
a
capital
case
and
otherwise,
you'll
have
the
situation
as
you're
having
here,
with
all
the
hypotheses
in
fact,
in
the
record,
which
justice
stewart
had
put
to
you.
assume
all
that,
can
the
defendant
say,
"i
reject
the
advise
of
my
lawyers
and
i
would
like
--
i
think,
i
have
a
chance,"
but
would
he
be
barred
by
the
--
not
only
the
honest
and
contentious,
but
the
wise
advice
of
lawyers
and
go
on
his
own?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you
may
or
may
not
be
familiar
with
cases
in
this
court,
dealing
with
this
problem
as
to
federal
prosecution
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
--
which
caused
to
be
raised
a
very
different
question
in
view
of
the
explicitness
of
the
right
to
counsel
in
the
federal
court
as
against
due
process
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
mere
fact
that
it's
a
professional
judgment
of
the
lawyer,
and
a
good
lawyer,
or
an
able
lawyer,
recognized
lawyer,
doesn't
necessarily
make
a
question
frivolous
for
the
one
who
has
been
many
years
or
few
years
at
the
bar,
you
get
jokes
in
picking
something
that's
frivolous
and
--
and
the
majority
of
the
court
quite
disappoints
your
prophesy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
mr.
--
whether
the
--
whether,
under
your
procedure,
in
case
this
should
go
against
him
and
the
coram
nobis
having
not
been
appealed,
whether
that
is
open
to
him,
another
coram
nobis
proceeding
so
that
he
may
come
up
here
on
that
proceeding
or
the
first
on
res
judicata,
under
your
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
habeas
corpus
may
be
renewed
in
virginia
after
one
unsuccessful
attempt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you're
right,
then
it
would
be
a
different
point.
if
you
enter
--
if
you
went
to
the
wrong
court
and
was
going
out
for
that
reason
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
can
go
to
a
right
court,
can
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
hearing
where,
mr.
harp?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
harp,
may
i
ask
you
to
put
these
views,
(inaudible)
now,
we
have
a
confused
situation.
put
aside
your
jurisdictional
--
the
jurisdictional
question
that
you
stirred
and
merely
addressing
oneself
to
the
question
of
indigence,
what
do
you
say
to
this,
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
light,
no
direct
light
from
the
virginia
court
as
against
court
or
anybody
else,
is
that
right?
at
best
one
can
argue
one
way
or
the
other
is
to
write
that
opinion
of
his
presupposes
whether
he
did
or
didn't
assume
that
this
man
was
indigent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
before
us,
the
underlying
documents.
maybe
the
two
letters
to
which
justice
black
referred
to
them
a
while
ago.
what
do
you
say
may
this
court,
in
the
situation
which
we
find
ourselves,
make
an
independent
judgment
and
conclude
that
those
letters
are
if
not
an
ignorant
man,
in
elegant
way
of
expressing
the
fact
the
he
doesn't
have
a
lawyer,
because
he
hasn't
got
the
money
to
hire
one,
to
pay
one.
is
--
is
it
open
to
this
court
to
make
an
independent
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
--
if
it
appeared
on
the
record
that
he
was
not
indigent,
then
of
course,
your
courts,
whatever
one
may
think
about
the
law,
need
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
him.
it
doesn't
appear
clearly
that
he
was
not
indigent.
it
doesn't
appear
clearly
as
far
as
your
argument
that
he
was
indigent.
in
that
situation,
what
do
you
concede
to
be
our
responsibility
to
such
a
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
harp,
the
very
tribute
you
paid
to
the
skill
of
this
layman,
namely
that
even
experienced
killer
may
be
proven
by
the
fact
that
he
thinks
it
would
be
irrelevant
for
him
to
argue
the
merits
of
an
appeal
when
all
he's
arguing
now,
is
the
right
to
have
an
appeal
in
the
course
of
which,
the
merits
of
the
appeal
could
be
established.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
the
right
to
have
an
appeal
is
competently
conducted
--
competently
pursued
and
he
may
--
what
he's
saying
here,
i
need
a
lawyer
in
order
--
adequately
to
present
my
case
being
an
experienced
fellow
you
say
that
he
knows
enough
so
that
this
stage,
he
shouldn't
argue
the
merits
of
a
potential
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
why
he
did
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
what
have
showed
that
this
is
not
an
ignorant
man,
the
way
the
--
the
idea
that
i
expressed
from
the
letter
and
the
way
they
are
and
that
certain
spectrum
with
which
and
of
course
we
know,
there
are
lots
of
very
good
lawyers
inside
a
jail.
i
mean
there
are
lots
of
lawyers,
lots
of
people
inside
of
jail,
who
behave
as
good
lawyers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
mr.
harp,
i'd
like
to
get
some
clarification
on
one
or
two
things.
the
assumption
to
which
you
answered
on
the
merits,
as
i
understand
--
as
i
--
as
i
followed
you,
you
dealing
with
the
merits
or
an
aspect
of
the
merits,
suggested
the
--
the
grave
consequences
as
you
see
them
of
making
this
a
decision
in
case
and
who
should
prevail,
retrospectively
saying
this
is
--
this
has
been
--
is
and
has
been
a
right
under
the
constitution
and
you
addressed
yourself
to
that
for
all
the
practical
difficulties.
one
of
the
assumptions
that
was
put
to
use,
is
that
there
were
errors
in
the
trial.
now,
practically,
how
often
would
that
assumption
in
its
unquestioned
form
come
before
this
court?
you
couldn't
tell
whether
there
were
errors
until
you
examine
the
record
on
the
merits,
unless
the
state
confesses
error
and
if
the
state
confesses
error,
it
wouldn't
be
confessing
it
here.
i
mean,
if
it
confessed
it
here,
it
would
take
appropriate
step,
i
should
suppose,
to
confess
it
below,
so
that
to
determine
whether
there
is
error
in
the
record
insofar
as
or
there
was
a
fair
trial
insofar
as
that
is
relevant
and
you
urged
its
relevant
for
the
consideration
you
gave,
couldn't
be
determined
merely
by
an
assertion,
but
would
require
this
court
to
canvas
whatever
record
is
available
of
the
original
trial.
is
that
--
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
--
you
might
find
it
of
interest
mr.
harp
to
look
at
the
case
in
which
we
have
to
deal
with
this
problem
with
reference
to
federal
prosecution,
ellis
against
the
united
states,
356
u.s.
674
and
there
had
been
one
or
two
other
summary
disposition
since.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
before
judge
hoffman,
mr.
harp?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
what
the
case
was
but
what
was
there
before
him?
what
--
what
record
of
the
state
proceedings
was
there
before
him,
which
justified
you
in
saying
that
judge
hoffman
found
there
were
no
errors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
days
was
this
trial
take,
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
and
you've
also
told
us
that
in
virginia,
you
have
no
court
stenographer,
so
that
the
proceedings
for
that
day
or
whatever
it
was
could
have
been
or
wasn't
before
judge
hoffman,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
before
judge
hoffman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
this
one?
when
this
proceeding
went
through?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
might've
eliminated
by
--
by
another
proceedure,
namely
to
ascertain
with
all
these
assumptions
that
had
been
made
in
this
case
or
so,
namely,
whether
he
is
indigent,
whether
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
because
able-lawyer
who
was
suggested
by
my
brother,
stewart,
they've
been
from
--
what
do
you
do
in
virginia,
mr.
boothe,
electrocute
or
hang?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
save
him
from
the
electric
chair,
etcetera,
etcetera
and
therefore,
he
would
come
even
within
the
rule
of
the
federal
court
of
our
court
rather
in
the
ellis
case,
that
he's
asking
the
state
to
spend
money
or
at
least
go
through
waste
of
judicial
attention,
when
it's
a
frivolous
case
in
the
technical
sense
in
that
term
and
there's
nothing
to
it
that
anybody
should
require
the
state
to
lend
it
a
--
for
an
appeal.
all
those
things
are
now,
certainly,
could
admire
their
little
clouding
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
should
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
should
think
the
thing
to
do
is
to
leave
this
cloud
utmost
and
not
to
say,
give
him
an
appeal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
find
out
whether
he
was
indigent.
that's
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
whether
there
was
a
postmortem
lightened
communication
is
this
letter
from
mr.
newsom
on
december
5th,
1960.
