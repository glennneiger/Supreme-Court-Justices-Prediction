what
is
the
explanation
of
the
long
delay
15
years
before
this
proceeding
was
brought
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
first,
we're
--
we're
not
concern
here
with
the
ultimate
question
as
to
whether
there
was
lack
of
due
process
or
not,
we're
concern
with
is
whether
the
context
of
this
record,
the
situation
was
such
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
not
having
him
a
counsel.
