mr.
percy
d.
williams
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
talk
to
the
court
about
a
prisoner
of
the
state
of
texas,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
who
is
serving
a
term
of
5
to
35
years
on
a
robbery
conviction.
his
claim
is
that
he
was
denied
due
process
when
he
was
tried
and
convicted
without
assistance
of
counsel.
his
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
originally
filed
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas.
that
court
denied
his
application
without
ordering
the
state
to
answer
and
without
ordering
any
development
of
the
record
of
the
facts.
i
don't
know
why
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
proceed
to
handle
it
in
that
way
because
in
other
cases
of
this
type
in
recent
years
that
court
has
proceeded
to
order
the
trial
court
to
develop
the
facts
as
a
basis
for
consideration
of
such
an
application.
i
think
that
if
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
had
before
it
the
record,
which
is
now
before
this
court,
it
would
have
granted
the
writ.
after
this
case
was
docketed
in
--
in
this
court,
the
notes
of
testimony
which
were
taken
at
the
trial
in
1944
by
the
reporter,
who
since
was
deceased,
were
transcribed
by
another
reporter
and
put
into
this
record.
and
the
charge
to
the
jury
at
the
petitioner's
trial
in
1944
was
also
located
and
is
now
included
in
this
record.
this
record
reflects
that
when
he
was
tried
on
this
robbery
charge,
the
petitioner
had
no
attorney.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
it
is
my
understanding,
your
honor,
that
it
is.
the
record
reflects
that
at
his
trial,
the
petitioner
pleaded
not
guilty.
he
testified
to
his
own
innocence.
and
he
attempted
in
a
brief
and
in
article
way
to
examine
several
cross-examines,
several
of
the
state's
witnesses,
but
that
was
as
much
as
he
was
able
to
do
in
his
own
defense.
under
the
texas
statute,
code
of
criminal
procedure,
which
was
in
effect
in
1944
when
this
case
was
tried,
there
was
no
duty
under
texas
law
on
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
for
an
indigent
defendant
in
a
non-capital
case.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
a
couple
of
years
ago.
the
statute
now
provides
that,
as
i
read
it,
although
it
has
not
been
construed
judicially,
that
in
all
cases,
all
felony
cases,
the
court
is
under
a
duty
to
appoint
counsel
for
an
indigent
accused.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
penitentiary
offense,
your
honor.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
i
believe
--
mr.
percy
d.
williams
--
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
now
--
mr.
percy
d.
williams
i
believe,
and
i'm
no
expert
in
criminal
matters,
your
honor,
not
experienced,
but
i
believe
that
the
offenses
in
our
penal
code
where
the
penalty
is
prescribed
read
more
or
less
uniformly
like
the
provision
under
which
this
man
was
convicted.
if
your
honor
will
look
on
page
3
of
my
brief
for
the
petitioner,
at
the
very
bottom
of
that
page,
you
will
notice
that
the
prescribing
portion
with
respect
to
punishment
states
that
he
shall
be
punished
by
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
for
life
or
for
a
term
of
not
less
than
five
years.
and
in
the
case
of
the
other
offense,
it's
included
in
the
same
article,
robbery
by
firearms,
again,
the
portion,
similar
portion
says
punishment
shall
be
death
or
confinement
in
the
penitentiary
for
any
term.
and
it's
my
understanding
that
that
is
the
basis
of
the
distinction
between
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor
whether
that
portion
of
the
statute
authorizes
confinement
in
the
penitentiary.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
to
clarify
the
situation,
if
i
may,
on
page
5
of
my
brief,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
statutes
which
were
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
petitioner's
trial
which
was
1944,
article
491
and
494.
491
stated
that
there
would
be
no
arraignment
of
a
defendant
expect
on
indictment
for
a
capital
offense,
and
494
provided
that
when
the
accused
is
brought
into
court
for
the
purpose
of
being
arraigned,
if
it
appeared
that
he
have
no
counsel,
too
poor
to
employ
counsel,
the
court
shall
appoint
one.
now,
on
the
next
page,
coming
to
the
point
raised
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
1959,
the
legislature
amended
article
494.
and
just
for
your
information,
though
it
has
no
materiality
to
this
case
that
i'm
aware
of,
at
the
top
of
page
6,
i
give
you
the
text
of
the
law
that
it's
presently
in
effect
that
whenever
it's
made
known
to
the
court
in
an
arraignment
or
any
other
time
that
an
accused
charged
with
the
felony
is
too
poor
to
employ
counsel,
the
court
shall
appoint
one
or
more
practicing
attorneys
to
defend
him.
and
although
some
question
is
to
the
construction
of
that
is
raised
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent,
it
seems
to
me
all
together
clear
that
that
means
that
in
any
felony
prosecution,
if
the
defendant
is
too
poor
to
employ
his
own
lawyer,
the
court
is
obligated
to
appoint
him
one.
but
the
trial
with
respect
to
which
we
are
here
concern
occurred
in
1944,
15
years
before
the
adoption
of
the
preferable
statute.
and
it
is
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
any
of
his
trial,
he
was
not
treated
fair
by
the
judge
or
by
the
prosecutor.
it's
my
contention
that
had
he
had
a
lawyer,
the
abuses
to
which
he
was
subjected
could
have
been
avoided,
the
sentence
which
was
imposed
upon
him
might
have
been
less
severe
and
possibly,
he
might
have
been
acquitted.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
and
if
he
is
tried
again,
if
this
court
reverses
this
case
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
remands
the
man
after
granting
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
remands
him
to
the
sheriff
of
orange
county
for
another
trial,
i
understand
that
under
that
article,
he
would
be
entitled
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
by
the
court.
now,
what
was
it
that
happened
to
this
man
at
his
trial?
in
the
first
place,
the
state
introduced
without
objection
in
the
hearing
of
the
jury
and
the
court
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
assigned
written
statement
that
included
a
complete
confession
by
this
prisoner
which
he
repudiated
at
the
time
of
trial.
as
i
read
the
record,
the
undisputed
uncontradicted
testimony
of
the
petitioner
and
the
state's
own
evidence,
taken
together,
established
beyond
any
question
that
this
confession
which
was
introduced
and
considered
against
him
was
coerced
and
was
involuntarily.
let
me
give
you
briefly,
if
i
may,
the
circumstances
that
led
to
his
confession.
the
robbery,
and
i'm
referring
here
only
to
the
undisputed
evidence
given
by
the
petitioner
in
testifying
for
himself
for
--
on
cross-examination
and
the
evidence
presented
by
the
state,
the
robbery
was
committed
late
one
saturday
night,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
the
following
sunday
morning
or
early
in
the
morning.
he
signed
his
confession
the
following
day,
a
monday
in
the
office
of
the
county
attorney
of
orange
county.
he
was
arrested
by
a
constable,
a
local
county
peace
officer
of
orange
county
across
the
louisiana
line
in
louisiana
after
a
close
pursuit,
as
they
call
it
in
louisiana
law,
from
texas
to
louisiana.
and
at
that
point,
where
the
prisoner
was
arrested
in
louisiana
instead
of
being
taken
under
--
in
accordance
with
louisiana
law
to
a
local
magistrate
for
an
examining
trial
which
was
this
petitioner's
right
at
that
moment
promptly
to
be
bound
over
to
await
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
extradition
which
was
also
his
right,
he
came
back
to
texas
after
having
been
given
the
choice
by
the
arresting
constable
from
orange
county
of
either
coming
back
with
him
or
being
run
back
across
the
river
by
louisiana
law.
when
the
man
was
--
when
the
petitioner
was
brought
back
to
texas,
he
was
not
promptly
taken
before
a
magistrate
of
texas
either
on
that
sunday
of
his
arrest
or
when
he,
at
latest,
should
have
been
under
our
law
on
the
following
monday
before
he
was
taken
in
to
sign
the
confession.
now,
i
don't
claim
that
the
confession
was
involuntary
by
reason
of
anything
that
i
have
said
per
se,
but
i
think
that
these
are
factors
of
illegal
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
arresting
officer
and
the
county
attorney
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
consider
as
part
of
the
background
and
fabric
of
coercion
that
seems
to
me
to
exist
in
this
case.
now,
what
happened
between
the
time
of
his
being
returned
to
orange,
texas
on
sunday
morning
when
he
was
put
in
jail
and
the
time
of
his
confession
in
the
county
attorney's
office
on
monday?
the
testimony
in
this
connection
is
--
is
almost
unbelievable.
the
--
the
--
in
short,
the
man
was
beat,
they
throw
water
on
him,
they
stamped
on
him,
they
--
they
threw
him
on
the
floor,
they
were
trying
to
get
a
confession.
and
i
want
--
this
is
the
most
important
part
of
my
case,
and
i
want
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
what
was
said
at
the
trial.
he
was
arrested
by
constable
named
williamson
and
some
of
williamson's
testimony
is
in
the
record
at
the
bottom
of
page
12.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
there
were
six
witnesses
produced
by
this
--
mr.
percy
d.
williams
i
beg
your
pardon.
of
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
the
record.
my
client
was
trying
to
cross-examine
williamson
and
in
the
last
three
or
four
lines
on
page
12
he
said
to
williamson,
"will
you
beat
me
up
across
in
louisiana?"
which
the
interesting
answer
was,
"i
never
touched
you
over
there.
i
have
scars
to
prove
it
on
my
back,"
top
of
page
13
to
which
the
answer
was,
"i
ain't
touched
you
but
once,
and
then
you
jerk
me
out
of
my
car
on
louisiana
highway,
beat
me
up
without
mercy,"
to
which
the
answer
was,
"it
wasn't
over
in
louisiana."
and
unbelievably,
the
prosecuting
attorney
excused
that
witness
at
that
point
without
making
any
effort
to
show
that
he
did
not
beat
this
man
during
the
short
interim
between
the
arrest
early
sunday
morning
and
the
confession
on
monday.
also,
i
would
call
to
the
attention
to
the
court
that
when
this
prisoner
was
brought
into
the
county
attorney's
office
for
his
--
to
sign
his
confession
at
the
--
in
the
middle
of
page
17
of
the
record,
again,
the
petitioner
cross-examining
the
county
attorney,
he
says
"at
the
time
they
brought
me
inside
your
office,
i
was
threatened
about
the
statement,
is
that
right?"
and
the
county
attorney
gave
him
what
seems
to
me
to
be
an
evasive
reply.
another
question,
"you
didn't
tell
me
anything
about
it,
did
you?"
and
then
later
on
that
page,
near
the
very
bottom,
"when
the
constable
threatened
to
take
me
out
and
tie
and
wipe
me
unless
they
got
a
confession,
is
that
right?"
the
county
attorney
merely
said,
"i
didn't
hear
it."
but
the
county
attorney,
at
the
top
of
page
18,
on
redirect
examination,
referring
to
the
time
when
this
prisoner
was
brought
in
to
his
office
the
day
following
the
arrest,
he
was
asked
by
the
prosecutor,
"did
he
look
like
he
had
been
abused?"
and
the
county
attorney
said,
"he
was.
he
had
a
bandage
on
his
head,
yes,
sir."
and
there,
in
the
next
four
or
five
questions
that
were
asked
by
the
prosecutor,
the
county
attorney
was
never
really
asked
whether
the
petitioner
was
threaten
immediately
before
he
signed
the
confession.
the
questions
simply
were,
"did
the
petitioner
tell
you
about
being
mistreated?
did
he
tell
you
the
statement
he
was
making
this
true?
did
he
tell
you
he
was
being
forced
to
make
the
statement?
and
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
had
been
the
prosecutor
and
had
wanted
to
establish
that
there
had
not
been
any
coercion
of
that
confession,
i
would've
ask
a
direct
question
requiring
a
direct
answer.
but
this
prosecutor
seems
to
have
had
no
qualms
about
the
coercion
that
proceeded
this
confession
or
over
in
the
course
of
his
examination
of
the
petitioner
on
page
27
of
the
record,
he
asked
an
unbelievably
brutal
line
of
questions
of
the
petitioner
that
condoned
in
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
the
brutality
which
have
been
meted
out
to
this
petitioner.
down
at
the
bottom
of
26
and
through
most
of
page
27
of
the
record,
the
district
attorney
was
asking
this
petitioner
and
said,
"officers
have
to
get
a
little
bit
rough
with
you,
you
don't
like
it
after
you've
done
everything
you
did
to
this
poor
old
man.
and
--
and
what
kind
of
treatment
would
you
be
in
favor
of
giving
a
man
that
would
beat
up
old
man
myers
as
he
said
he
was
beaten
up.
what
kind
of
treatment
would
you
be
in
favor
of
for
such
a
man?"
and
when
my
client
said,
"i
beg
for
mercy,"
the
smart
question
of
the
prosecutor
was,
"just
like
you
meted
out
to
mr.
myers
or
would
have
to
anybody
else."
mr.
percy
d.
williams
in
--
in
my
opinion,
your
honor,
they
would
have
been
excludable
under
decisions
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
in
that,
they
tended
to
condone
what
had
been
admitted
by
the
officer
who
gave
the
punishment
to
be
physical
abuse.
and
they
brought
into
issue
the
question
of
whether
this
man
was
merciful
or
would've
beaten
up
just
anybody,
and
that
was
an
issue
of
going
to
his
character
and
reputation
that
i
do
not
believe
had
been
raised
by
his
appearance
on
the
stand.
i
think
they
--
mr.
percy
d.
williams
i
think
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
have
said
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
trial
court
to
prevent
that
line
of
questioning,
and
i
think
i
have
one
or
two
cases
cited
in
my
brief,
though
the
exact
name
of
them
escapes
me,
in
which
that
type
of
interrogation
by
the
court
was
--
was
held
to
have
been
excludable
and
should
have
been
excludable
on
the
court's
own
motion.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
now,
what
could
a
lawyer
have
done
with
regard
to
this
confession?
first,
he
could've
seen
to
it
that
it
was
heard
in
the
preliminary
way
outside
the
hearing
of
the
jury.
second,
if
i
am
correct
in
my
evaluation
of
the
import
of
this
testimony,
he
could've
had
excluded
on
objection
under
both
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
texas
cases.
there
were
at
least
six
of
them
from
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
prior
to
1944.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
it
was
indeed,
sir.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
under
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
it
should
have
been
--
should
heard,
it
should
have
been
heard
initially
outside
the
jury's
hearing.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
first
--
mr.
percy
d.
williams
indeed.
and
since
reading
the
more
recent
opinion
of
this
case
in
mcneal
and
culver
hastened
to
add
one
point,
which
i
did
not
have
in
my
brief,
and
that
is
that
the
--
although
the
burden
is
on
the
state
on
the
defendant
to
show
that
he
was
under
arrest
at
the
--
at
the
time
he
made
this
confession.
the
burden
is
on
the
state
of
texas
under
our
code
of
criminal
procedure
to
show
that
it
was
a
voluntary
confession.
and
a
recent
case
to
that
effect
is
the
harris
case
out
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
286
s.
w.
2d
936.
now,
i
want
to
point,
if
i
may,
two
other
serious
errors,
prejudicial
occurrences
at
this
trial
which
counsel
could
have
prevented.
there
were
a
couple
of
oral
confessions
that
were
introduced
against
this
prisoner.
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
voluntary
or
not.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
were
voluntary
under
the
texas
statute.
they
were
not
made
before
a
magistrate,
they
were
not
warned,
and
they
were
not
signed.one
of
them
was
a
testimony
by
a
deputy
sheriff
appearing
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
prior
to
trial,
petitioner
had
offered
himself
as
wanting
to
plead
guilty.
and
texas
cases
squarely
hold
that
oral
evidence
of
a
prior
offer
or
agreement
to
plead
guilty
amounts
to
an
unwarned
confession,
and
it's
not
admissible
on
objection.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
honestly
know.
i
understand
that
from
the
petition
filed
in
this
court
by
the
petitioner
that
he
has
filed
numerous
applications
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
none
of
them
have
ever
been
applications.
this
is
the
first
time
that
any
court
has
ever
cared
about
this
man.
i'm
the
first
lawyer
he's
ever
had.
and
--
mr.
percy
d.
williams
i
don't
know
[laughs]
i
don't
why
it's
taking
him
so
long.
he
is
just
poor
frogman
of
a
person.
and
i
feel
that
he
needs
for
you
to
say
that
he
was
mistreated
and
treated
unfairly
here.
now,
it
was
reversible
error
for
those
hearsay
statements
of
oral
--
oral
confessions
to
be
admitted.
there
was
also
an
admission
in
the
confession,
signed
confession
of
his
prior
louisiana
felony
conviction.
now,
under
texas
law
that
should
not
have
been
admitted
at
the
time
it
was.
his
character
was
not
--
his
character
for
reputation
for
credibility
was
not
in
issue
at
that
point.
it
could've
been
excluded
at
that
point.
later,
when
the
petitioner
went
on
the
stand
in
his
own
defense,
he
put
his
reputation
and
character
for
veracity,
credibility
in
issue.
and
that
evidence
of
his
prior
louisiana
felony
conviction
was
then
admissible
for
that
limited
purpose.
and
although
the
respondent
in
his
brief
says
it
was
limited
for
the
purpose
of
consideration
on
the
issue
of
credibility,
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
that
in
the
record,
in
the
charge,
the
jury
or
any
where
in
the
record,
anything
limiting
the
jury's
consideration
of
that
prior
conviction
to
the
single
question
of
credibility.
and
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
held
that
whether
or
not
such
limitation
in
the
jury
charge
is
requesting
its
reversible
error
not
to
so
limit
the
purpose
for
which
that
kind
of
evidence
maybe
considered.
there
was
a
lot
of
miscellaneous
hearsay.
there
were
questions
which
a
prosecutor
under
our
texas
case
is
--
cannot
ask,
"why
didn't
you
have
witnesses
here?"
that
is
an
improper
comment
for
a
prosecutor
in
texas.
those
are
the
things
that
actually
happened
at
this
trial.
in
looking
over
the
record,
it
seems
to
me
entirely
possible
that
a
good
lawyer
might
have
been
able
to
take
this
petitioner's
testimony
with
respect
to
his
condition
immediately
before
the
offense
and
make
out
of
it,
a
well-founded
issue
of
temporary
insanity
because
he
testified
without
contradiction
and
the
state's
evidence
also
showed
that
he
had
been
drinking
rum
and
beer
and
taking
something
called
either
"fematol"
or
"amatol",
it's
variously
referred
to
in
this
record,
immediately
before
this
robbery
that
he
was
delirious,
that
he
had
passed
out
and
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
texas
authorities
on
this
point.
we
have
a
statute
that
says
that
evidence
of
temporary
insanity
resulting
from
combined
use
of
whiskey
and
narcotics,
it
doesn't
excuse
the
crime
but
it
can
be
taken
into
account
and
mitigation
of
punishment.
but
at
the
same
time,
there
is
one
decision
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
court
properly
charged
the
jury
that
under
those
circumstances,
there
was
a
--
an
issue
of
excuse
for
the
crime
justifying
an
acquittal.
now,
what
was
the
circumstance
or
the
condition
of
this
man
at
the
time
that
these
things
happened
to
him
at
his
trial?
he
was
25
years
of
age,
according
to
undisputed
testimony.
he
was
referred
to
as
a
boy,
young
man.
he'd
been
in
jail
continuously
for
almost
four
months
from
the
time
of
his
arrest.
when
he
was
arrested,
the
constable
testified,
they
took
from
him
all
the
money
that
was
on
the
man's
person.
the
jailer
testified
deputy
sheriff
that
he
had
advanced
money
to
this
man
to
send
out
telegrams
from
the
jail
to
his
relatives.
the
boy
testified
that
he
had
no
friends
present
at
the
trial.
his
mother
was
sick,
his
father,
he
could
not
depend
on.
he'd
been
given
a
medical
discharge
from
the
army.
the
state's
witness
testified
that
he
had
been
badly
shook
up
in
the
army.
he
was
suffering
from
moods.
he
was
taking
nerve
medicine
on
doctor's
prescriptions.
and
under
those
circumstances,
i'm
asking
you
to
--
to
hold
that
on
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
record,
no
further
development
of
these
facts
by
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
necessary
before
it
grants
the
writ.
the
undisputed
evidence
shows
that
this
man
was
denied
due
process,
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
writ.
of
course,
the
matter
of
request
is
unimportant.
he
alleges
that
he
requested
counsel,
and
the
counsel
was
not
provided.
under
your
recent
reaffirmation
in
mcneal
and
culver,
that's
unimportant.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
sir?
mr.
percy
d.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
--
would
amount
to
a
waiver
of
his
federal
right.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
well,
i
believe
we
have
concessions
from
the
respondent
that
didn't
--
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
man
asked
for
counsel
or
not.
however,
that
doesn't
go
quite
to
your
inquiry.
perhaps,
you
have
a
good
point
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
anything
in
the
record
that
amounts
to
a
concession
by
the
state
that
he
refused
--
that
he
did
not
refused
counsel.
that
may
be
an
open
question
of
fact.
mr.
percy
d.
williams
thank
you.
