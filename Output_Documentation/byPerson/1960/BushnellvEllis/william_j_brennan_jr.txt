j.
brennan,

i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
new
texas
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
the
appointment
requirement
to
appoint
a
counsel
to
felony.that's
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
this
much
is
clear,
mr.
williams,
that
had
he
been
tried
within
the
last
couple
of
years
on
the
offense
for
which
he
was
convicted,
the
revised
494
would
have
required
the
appointment
of
counsel,
is
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
your
suggestion,
mr.
williams,
the
whole
proceeding
governing
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
was
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
there
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
may
have
--
may
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
requires
a
request
of
it,
of
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
but
there
must
be
one
otherwise
may
be
heard
in
the
presence
of
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
point
is
that
had
he
had
counsel
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
might
suppose
the
request
would've
been
made
for
a
hearing
on
the
presence
of
the
jury.
