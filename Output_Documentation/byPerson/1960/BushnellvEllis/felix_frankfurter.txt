mr.
williams,
may
i
ask
you
whether
if
he
had
the
(inaudible)
defense
lawyer
in
texas,
could
those
questions
be
subject
to
objection
if
it's
inadmissible
or
improper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
care
if
they
came
and
say
excludable?
would
they
--
do
you
think
it
would've
been
error
on
--
error
by
your
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
lucky
color.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
--
in
the
writ
--
is
the
writ
tried
in
the
court
of
--
in
your
court
of
criminal
appeals
or
do
they
sent
it
back
to
a
lower
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
they
have
to
--
they
wouldn't
--
they
would
act
on
the
record
of
the
trial
court
rather
than
it's
too
substantially
as
i
believe,
whereby
the
appellate
court
is
asked
to
leave
to
send
the
case
for
determination
of
their
claims
so
far
as
their
contested
facts
at
lower
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
well,
i
--
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
i
thought
you
said
--
i
--
if
i
understood
the
chief
justice's
question
was
whether
there
was
any
application
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
courts
of
texas,
and
i
understood
your
reply
to
be
that
that
must
be
lodged
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
the
chief
justice,
may
i
ask
question
after
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
only
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
only
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
in
your
brief,
and
my
brother
clark
has
pointed
out,
you
say
in
your
brief
that
implied
within
--
whatever
the
figures
are
300
odd,
in
your
brief
some
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
actually
filed
in
your
court
of
criminal
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
federal
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
you
say
you
are
not,
do
you
think
the
general's
office
doesn't
have
to
deal
with
those,
that
means
the
district
prosecutors
deal
with
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
competent
to
statewide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
call
him
state's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state's
attorney.
