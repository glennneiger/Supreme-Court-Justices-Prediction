versus

ellis,
director,
texas
department
of
corrections.
mr.
williams,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
timmins.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
you
--
you
wouldn't
consider
that
a
denial
that
he
had
beat
him
without
mercy,
would
you?
what
you
just
read
on
13
or
the
question
by
the
defendant
was,
"you
jerk
me
out
of
my
car
over
on
a
louisiana
state
highway,
no
louisiana
law,
just
you
and
two
kids
had
beat
me
up
without
mercy,"
and
the
answer
was,
"it
wasn't
over
in
louisiana."
that
--
that's
hardly
a
denial
of
--
of
beating
him
up
without
mercy,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
--
but
just
before
that,
the
petitioner
said,
"well,
you
beat
me
up
across
in
louisiana,"
and
the
answer
was,
"i
never
touched
you
over
there."
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
and
the
next
question
was,
"i
have
scars
to
prove
it
on
my
back,"
and
the
answer
is,
"i
ain't
touched
you
but
once,"
and
then
we
get
to
that
question,
"you
jerked
me
out
of
my
car
over
louisiana
state
highway,
no
louisiana
law,
just
you
and
two
kids
and
beat
me
up
without
mercy."
answer,
he
wasn't
over
in
louisiana.
this
is
hardly
a
denial,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
question
was,
"i
have
scars
on
--
that
--
to
prove
it
on
my
back,"
and
the
answer
says,
"i
ain't
touched
you
but
once,"
is
that
--
would
you
consider
that
a
denial
or
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
didn't
--
didn't
they
have
a
full
opportunity?
i
notice
after
this
page
13
when
he
said
it
wasn't
over
in
louisiana,
the
district
attorney
excused
the
witness.
he
never
asked
him
another
--
another
question
to
clear
that
up
although
he
did
have
real
opportunity
to
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
man
--
did
this
man
try
to
get
into
the
federal
court,
i
mean
into
the
state
courts
to
have
this
matter
heard
before
this
proceeding?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
that
the
place
for
him
to
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
you
say
that
he
made
no
effort
to
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
any
court
in
texas
for
this
long
period
of
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
--
what
other
courts
in
the
state
would
have
had
jurisdiction
over
habeas
corpus
or
coram
nobis
or
whatever
it
might
--
might
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
after
he
--
after
he's
convicted
and
was
in
the
penitentiary,
what
other
courts
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
---
than
the
court
of
--
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
just
told
us
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
what
i
did
not
understand.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
would
think
--
i
would
think
that
would
give
him
a
terrible
burden
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
to
have
all
those
writs
from
all
the
prisoners
and
all
your
penitentiaries
go
direct
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
