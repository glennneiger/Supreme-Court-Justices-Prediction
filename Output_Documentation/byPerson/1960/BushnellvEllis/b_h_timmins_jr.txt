mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
initially,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
referring
to
the
question
just
asked
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
regarding
the
import
of
development
regarding
the
possibility
of
petitioner
not
asking
for
counsel
or
refusing
counsel,
i
believe
it
was.
to
begin
with,
the
record
begins
with
a
question
and
answer
examination
of
witnesses.
and
there
is
nothing,
of
course,
in
the
record
pertaining
to
whether
he
asked
for
a
counsel
or
whether
he
was
denied
counsel
or
whether
he
refused
counsel.
the
statement
was
made
in
our
brief.
and
we
really
admit
that
the
--
the
basic
question
here
is
the
fundamental
fairness
and
justice
of
the
trial.
as
accorded
petitioner
by
the
trial
court
whether
--
whether
or
not
he
was
offered
counsel
and
refused
counsel
is
not
reflected,
and
i
--
i
know
of
no
way
that
it
can
be
developed
under
the
circumstances
since
we
have
made
a
very
careful
inquiry
into
the
facts
of
the
case
by
going
into
orange
county
and
trying
to
find
witnesses
who
remember
this
case.
we
--
we
learned
that
the
trial
judge
is
dead.
the
district
attorney
who
tried
the
case
did
not
have
an
independent
recollection
of
the
case
and
neither
did
mr.
sexton,
the
county
attorney.
many
of
the
other
witnesses
are
dead.
this
was
one
of
the
--
this
was
one
of
the
principle
problems
that
we
encountered
in
this
case
as
well
as
other
similar
cases
where
there
has
been
a
long
passage
of
time
as
there
was
here.
we
found
that
it
was
quite
difficult,
and
in
many
instances,
possible
to
find
witnesses
who
could
make
affidavits
to
support
the
contentions
to
include
as
exhibit
with
the
responses
to
the
applications
because
witnesses
either
had
passed
away,
they
did
not
remember
the
cases,
and
we
have
encountered
this
time
and
time
again
as
we
did
here.
now,
the
--
the
texas
law
that
we're
concern
with
here
is
article
494.
i
want
to
refer
to
the
questions
which
were
put
to
mr.
williams
regarding
the
amendment
to
the
statute.
it
was
amended
in
1959.
the
texas
courts
did
not
construe
the
statute.
and
we
do
not
know
whether
or
not
counsel
is
required
in
every
case.
my
information
is
that
the
practice
is
not
uniform
in
texas
courts
under
this
amended
statute.
some
courts
appoint
counsel
in
every
felony
case,
some
do
not.
and
so
we
--
we
simply
do
not
know.
however,
of
course,
we're
concern
with
the
statute
as
it
existed
in
1944.
again,
we
think
it
is
not
significant
how
the
statute
read
because
the
--
the
real
question
that
we're
faced
with
is
whether
the
trial
court
accorded
the
petitioner
a
fundamentally
fair
and
just
trial
under
the
facts
of
the
case.
we
have
to
look
to
the
facts
in
each
individual
case.
that
is
established.
now,
under
the
texas
law,
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
cases
as
--
as
article
494
read
at
that
time,
counsel
was
not
required
in
non-capital
felony
cases
unless
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
by
the
trial
court
resulted
in
a
trial
which
was
not
fundamentally
fair
and
just
to
the
petitioner.
now,
petitioner
has
asserted
a
great
number
of
grounds
here
on
which
he
claims
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
we
believe
that
he's
read
meanings
into
the
record
which
are
not
justified
from
the
testimony.
he
has
referred
to
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officer,
mr.
williamson,
on
page
12
of
the
record
and
at
the
top
of
page
13.
mr.
williamson
testified
that
he
had
not
put
the
scars
on
his
body.
he
testified
that
he
did
not
jerked
him
out
of
the
car
over
in
louisiana
and
beat
him
up.
the
question
was
raised
with
regard
to
whether
he
jerked
him
out
of
the
car
in
louisiana
and
beat
him
up.
he
stated
that
he
did
not,
in
reply
to
the
question.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
i
think
we
are
concerned
with
--
with
that
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
--
question
whether
he
was
prejudiced
and
as
a
result
of
his
prejudice
whether
he
was
denied
due
process.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
i
--
i
think
it
follows
the
--
the
second
question,
yes,
sir.
now,
over
on
page
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
it
--
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
in
the
context
of
the
question,
your
honor,
it
was
--
it
was
a
denial
that
he
jerked
him
out
of
the
car
in
louisiana.
it
--
i
--
i
admit
that
it
was
not
developed
there
as
to
whether
he
may
jerked
him
out
of
the
car
or
in
some
other
place.
that
was
not
developed.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
it
is
--
it
is
not
a
denial
that
--
i
would
say
that
--
that
replaying
to
the
question,
as
i
asked,
it
was
a
denial
that
he
jerked
him
out
of
the
car
over
in
louisiana.
i
--
i
do
not
know
--
i
do
not
know
what
might
have
been.
it
was
not
developed
further
whether
he
jerked
him
out
of
the
car
or
not.
he
--
he
did
say
he
had
touched
him
once.
we
do
not
know
whether
he
touched
him
and
arresting
him
just
what.
but
i
refer
the
court
to
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
a
denial
of
the
beating?
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
i
would
consider
--
i
would
consider
--
i
can't
--
i
can't
import
an
absolute
denial
to
that
answer.
i
would
--
i
would
simply
say
that
he
testified
there
that
he
did
not
jerk
him
out
of
a
car
over
in
louisiana,
and
that
he
did
not
touch
him
over
in
louisiana.
and
then
in
later
testimony,
on
page
31
of
the
record,
his
--
the
same
man
testifying,
the
same
officer
testifying
said
that
he
--
in
--
in
reply
to
a
direct
question
from
the
district
attorney
said
that
he
did
not
put
the
scars
on
--
on
the
man's
body.
the
question,
"did
you
or
officer
thompson
put
those
scars
on
his
body?"
"no,
sir."
"did
you
hit
him
or
beat
him
in
any
way
to
make
those
scars?"
"no."
and
then
he
said
he
went
on
and
told
that
he
was
shook
up
in
the
army
in
taking
"amatol".
i
would
say
that
--
that
reading
his
testimony
in
full,
he
has
denied
that
he
beat
him
up
or
put
the
scars
on
his
body
in
the
full
context
of
--
of
the
question
then
answers.
now,
respondent
takes
the
position
that
after
the
long
passage
of
time
here,
the
state
is
in
a
position
that
it
cannot
find
witnesses
who
were
on
the
scene
at
the
time
of
the
trial
or
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
who
can
make
affidavits
bearing
on
the
central
question
here,
that
is,
whether
he
was
mistreated
in
--
at
--
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
or
during
his
trial.
we
feel
that
the
trial
judge
knows
the
elements
of
a
fair
trial.
and
that
his
wisdom
in
judgment
should
be
respected
unless
it's
patently
erroneous.
the
trial
judge
heard
the
testimony
with
regard
to
the
arrest.
he
heard
the
testimony
relating
to
the
confession.
he
admitted
the
confession
in
the
evidence
after
hearing
the
repudiation
of
it
by
petitioner
from
the
witness
stand.
we
feel
that
petition
--
that
the
trial
judge's
wisdom
in
his
judgment
in
these
matters
must
be
given
varied
weight.
we
do
not
feel
that
the
testimony
of
the
arresting
officers
are
the
repudiation
of
the
confession
by
the
petitioner
justifies
a
finding
that
he
was
denied
due
process
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
now,
we
do
really
admit
that
a
representation
by
counsel
better
than
no
representation
at
all
and
that
under
our
adversary
system
that
justice
is
more
likely
to
resolve.
but
at
the
same
time,
we
must
examine
the
record,
and
we
cannot
read
into
the
record
certain
assumptions
with
regard
to
mistreatment.
when
there
is
no
opportunity
for
a
reputation
of
those
ex
parte
and
self-serving
declarations
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
your
honor,
i
was
not
speaking
of
the
time
of
trial.
i
was
talking
about
the
time
that
the
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
made.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
at
--
at
a
much
later
time
that
habeas
corpus
is
--
is
sought,
not
at
the
time
of
trial
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
--
was
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
--
was
my
reference
there.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
sir?
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
clyde
williams.
and
i
think
hop
must
have
been
a
nickname
of
some
sort.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
apparently,
it's
the
same
man,
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
yes,
sir,
that
--
his
--
his
earlier
testimony
and
later
testimony
must
be
read
together.
respondent
also
appeals
that
this
case
is
help
subvert
the
--
the
traditional
in
the
proper
remedy
of
the
writ.
we
have
encountered
many
of
these
cases,
and
we
feel
that
--
that
this
is
--
this
is
one
in
which
due
to
the
passage
of
time
that
we
are
placed
in
a
great
disadvantage
in
being
able
to
refute
any
contentions
made
by
the
petitioner.
we
feel
that
granting
a
reversal
of
the
case
could
have
very
significant
policy
implications
in
this
whole
area.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
before
this
proceeding?
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
i
find
no
record
of
it
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
your
honor.
i
have
examined
their
record.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
the
place
that
he
would
go.
he
would
--
he
would
apply
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
he
did
not
appeal
his
case
here.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
order
the
trial
court
to
send
the
record
up,
and
they
would
then
examine
the
record
in
the
case
to
ascertain
whether
there
had
been
a
denial
in
--
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
they
would
--
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
they
would
act
on
the
record
of
the
lower
court.
now,
after
the
conviction,
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
can
be
made
to
the
trial
court
as
a
predicate
to
appeal.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
after
the
conviction,
the
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
may
be
lodged
with
the
trial
court
and
then
an
appeal
may
be
made
and
then
an
application
may
be
lodged
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
we
have
several
alternative
remedies.
he
--
he
can
go
either
anyway
that
he
chooses.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
discover
from
the
record
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
his
--
his
first
--
his
first
application
was
made
last
year.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
the
trial
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
no
other
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
no
other
court,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
the
trial
court
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
--
after
conviction,
immediately
after
conviction
before
sentencing,
immediately
after
conviction,
there
could
have
been
an
application
for
habeas
corpus
to
the
trial
court.
when
he
went
to
the
penitentiary
subsequent
to
sentencing,
the
only
court
that
has
jurisdiction
in
an
appeal
or
in
habeas
corpus
is
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
the
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
the
trial
judge
would
consider
it
in
either
granted
or
denied
at
that
time,
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
and
then
--
and
then
after
sentencing,
after
sentencing
and
--
and
the
man
was
in
the
penitentiary,
then
the
application
would
be
lodged
directly
with
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
and
only
that.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
it
does.
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
during
the
past
four
years,
we
have
encountered
in
--
in
the
texas
attorney
general's
office
about
375
applications
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
either
filed
in
--
no,
sir.
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
those
matters
are
not
even
handled
by
our
office.
the
--
the
writs
which
i
--
to
which
i
refer
or
the
applications
for
certiorari
in
this
court
are
applications
in
the
united
states
district
courts.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
the
federal
courts.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
those
are
the
ones
which
--
to
which
i
refer.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
we
do
not
deal
with
the
ones
in
the
state
courts,
the
district
prosecutors
to
handle
those.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
we
have
a
state's
attorney.
and
he
works
with
the
--
he
works
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
--
with
the
--
with
the
district
attorney
in
presenting
those
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
only
ones
which
we
handle
are
those
which
reach
the
federal
courts.
and
we
have
--
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
in
conjunction
with
the
district
attorney.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
state's
attorney.
mr.
b.
h.
timmins,
jr.
he
--
he
represents
the
state
before
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
