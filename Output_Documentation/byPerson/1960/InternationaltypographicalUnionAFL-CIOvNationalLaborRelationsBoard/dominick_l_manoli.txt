mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
this
case
as
i
have
said
during
my
argument
in
the
preceding
one
is
the
same
as
indeed
number
339,
namely
--
namely
whether
the
savings
clause
in
a
contract
of
this
kind
does
effectively
neutralize
or
suspend
the
otherwise
illegal
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
now
if
we
prevail,
if
the
board
should
prevail
upon
that
issue,
then
there
is
the
ancillary
question
of
it
with
respect
to
the
foreman
clause
whether
the
foreman
clause
which
requires
that
the
foreman
be
a
union
member,
that
he
is
given
exclusive
authority
to
hire,
whether
that
clause
also
is
in
violation
of
the
statute
since
as
a
union
member,
presumably,
he
would
be
required
under
--
he
would
be
under
an
obligation
to
observe
the
union's
laws,
the
union's
general
laws.
now,
the
issue
in
this
case
arises
in
a
slightly
different
context
and
it
did
in
the
case
preceding
this
one.
in
the
case
preceding
this
one,
the
party
did
enter
into
an
agreement
and
the
board
found
that
the
agreement
and
the
practice
they're
under,
constituted
a
closed-shop
or
an
illegal
union
preferential
hiring
system.
here
--
here,
the
publishers
resisted,
resisted
these
clauses
despite
the
union's
insistence.
in
fact,
the
union
went
out
on
strike
in
support
of
these
clauses.
the
board
found
that
these
clauses
that
they
had
been
accepted,
as
in
the
preceding
case,
would
have
also
violated
the
closed-shop
brand
of
statute
and
that
therefore,
the
union
by
insisting
upon
these
as
there
was
a
basis
as
--
as
a
term
of
the
contract
and
going
out
on
strike
in
support
of
them,
not
only
violated
the
statutory
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
but
also
violated
the
statutory
prohibition
against
attempts
to
cause
an
employer
to
discriminate
against
--
against
employees.
now,
the
validity
of
these
findings
depends
upon
the
legality
of
the
savings
clause
and
the
so-called
foreman
clause.
if
the
board
is
right
in
holding
that
the
savings
clause
and
the
foreman
clause
do
violate
the
statute,
then
i
think
there
can
be
a
little
disagreement,
little
serious
disagreement
that
the
union's
conduct
is
always
a
violation
of
both
the
statutory
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
as
well
as
the
statutory
prohibition
against
attempts
to
cause
discrimination.
now,
i
have
already
discussed
the
board's
position
with
respect
to
the
savings
clause,
the
general
laws
clause
and
the
savings
clause
there
and
i
shall
not
repeat
what
i
have
already
said.
i
therefore
turn
to
the
foreman
clause.
now,
the
second
circuit
in
the
preceding
case
did
not
reach
this
issue
because
having
settled,
having
resolved
the
threshold
question
with
respect
to
the
savings
clause
adversely
to
the
board.
it
said
that
the
ground
had
been
cut
out
from
under
the
board's
position
with
respect
to
the
“foreman
clause”.
now,
the
proposal
or
the
foreman
clause
here
require
the
foreman
to
be
a
union
member
and
vested
him
exclusively
with
control
over
employment
hiring
in
the
composing
room
of
these
two
newspapers.
the
--
one
of
the
publishers
in
this
case,
i
think
it
is
significant.
one
of
the
publishers
in
this
case
suggested
to
the
union
that
union
membership
be
made
optional
and
thereby
minimize,
thereby
minimize
the
union's
control,
the
union's
control
over
the
foreman,
but
the
union
refused
to
--
refused
to
agree
to
that
proposal.
now,
as
a
member
of
the
union
--
as
a
member
of
the
union,
the
foreman
would
have
been
under
an
obligation
to
respect
the
union's
rules
at
least
to
the
extent
that
they
were
not
inconsistent
with
the
specific
terms
of
the
contract.
and
the
itu
general
laws
as
i
have
already
stated,
contained
numerous
provisions,
numerous
provisions
which
call
--
which
--
which
would
effectuate
or
put
into
effect
--
establish
closed-shop
--
closed-shop
conditions.
now
the
vesting
of
exclusive
authority
or
hiring
authority
in
a
foreman
who
had
to
be
a
member
of
the
union
has
been
an
important
aspect
of
the
closed-shop
policy
of
the
itu.
the
foreman
has
served
as
the
watch
dog
and
as
well
as
the
--
for
the
union
as
well
as
the
enforcer
of
its
closed-shop
policy.
and
the
union,
the
union
has
been
able
to
keep
tabs
on
him,
has
been
able
to
keep
tabs
on
him
because
it
controlled
his
employment
as
a
foreman.
he
could
not
be
a
foreman
unless
he
was
also
a
union
member.
now,
against
this
background,
against
--
against
this
background,
we
submit
that
the
board
was
entitled
to
say
that
the
“foreman
clause”
was
an
additional
device,
an
additional
device
for
maintaining
closed-shop
conditions.
in
fact,
the
employers
opposed
--
opposed
the
foreman
clause
precisely
for
that
reason
--
precisely
for
that
reason,
because
they
could
foresee
--
they
could
foresee
that
a
foreman
required
to
be
a
union
member
vested
with
exclusive
hiring
authority
that
it
would
be
only
natural
--
it
would
be
only
natural
for
him
to
favor
union
members
and
certain
the
employees,
the
employees
would
have
no
less
reason
for
thinking
so.
now,
we
say
that
at
the
company
--
the
companies
and
the
union
subscribed
to
this
kind
of
contract
having
these
foreseeable
consequences,
it
would
have
been
just
exactly
as
though
they
had
included
closed-shop
conditions
or
union
preferential
hiring
system
in
the
contract
itself
and
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
made
here
that
there
is
no
basis
for
the
board
to
draw
an
inference,
that
the
foreman
who
is
an
arm
of
management
in
one
sense,
that
he
would
give
precedence
--
give
precedence
to
his
duty
to
the
union,
namely,
to
prefer
union
members
over
his
duty
to
the
employer
to
a
hire
or
fire
on
the
basis
of
competency
alone
without
regard
to
union
membership
or
the
lack
of
it.
now,
we
don't
believe
this
argument
really
very
scrutiny.
under
this
contract,
had
it
been
signed,
the
employer
would
have
divested
himself
of
control
over
employment.
it
would
have
been
turned
over
to
the
union.
the
employment
in
the
composing
room
would
no
longer
be
a
prerogative
of
the
employer,
but
it
would
have
been
primarily
a
union
concern.
the
contract
itself
prescribed
no
con
--
no
requirements
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
foreman's
exclusive
hiring
authority
other
than
the
hired
journeymen
and
apprentices.
the
foreman
was
left
entirely
free.
he
was
left
entirely
free
to
prefer
union
members
and
indeed
we
think
he
was
under
a
compelling
--
compelling
--
there
were
compelling
reasons
that
would
have
prompted
him
to
prefer
union
members
because
his
job
as
a
foreman
depended
upon
his
maintain
--
maintaining
himself
in
the
good
places
of
the
union,
because
he
could
be
a
foreman
only
as
long
as
he
remains
a
union
member.
now,
it's
been
suggested
here
--
it
has
been
suggested
here
that
the
employer
--
that
the
union
could
not
grieve
over
the
failure
or
he
could
not
grieve
if
the
employee
--
if
the
employer
disciplined
the
foreman
because
it
failed
to
issue
instructions
--
because
he
had
failed
to
abide
by
his
instructions.
now,
there
were
--
there
was
nothing
in
the
contract
--
nothing
in
the
contract
which
were
permitted
to
the
employer
to
tell
this
--
to
tell
this
foreman
to
disregard
the
union's
rules
when
it
came
to
exercising
of
his
exclusive
power
to
hire
and
fire
because
although
the
contract
said
was
that
he
was
to
hire
--
he
was
to
hire
a
journeyman
or
apprentices.
he
was
completely
free
--
completely
free
to
prefer
union
members
and
there
would
have
been
no
basis
--
no
basis
for
the
employer
to
complain
insofar
as
the
contract
was
concerned
to
complain
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
if
the
court
please.
when
the
court
arose,
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
argument
that
this
contract
had
it
been
signed,
would
have
contained
a
provision
which
prohibited
the
union
from
disciplining
a
foreman
for
following
the
written
instructions
of
the
employer.
and
that
this
provision
would
have
--
for
the
safeguard
--
the
safeguard
against
the
foreman
misusing
his
hiring
authority
to
prefer
union
members.
i
think
the
short
answer
to
that
argument,
your
honor
is
that
under
the
contract,
the
employer
retained
no
control
with
respect
to
the
foreman's
exercise
of
the
hiring
authority,
that
he
was
free
to
hire
--
to
exercise
that
hiring
authority
to
favor
union
members
and
there
would
have
been
no
basis
--
no
basis
since
there
was
no
reservation
of
any
right
with
respect
to
this
--
that
matter.
there
would
have
been
no
basis
for
the
employer
to
have
issued
written
instructions
to
the
foreman
concerning
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
this
concludes
my
argument
on
the
foreman
clause
as
a
violation
of
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
statute.
and
essentially,
as
the
court
undoubtedly
has
recognized,
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
foreman
clause
is
very
much
like
the
argument
which
underlies
our
position
with
respect
to
the
general
savings
clause.
that
these
provisions
create
a
situation
that
were
foreseeable,
the
employees
will
act
as
though
there
were
closed-shop
conditions
in
effect
that
they
had
been
put
into
effect
by
the
parties
and
that
therefore
the
parties
must
be
held
accountable
for
those
foreseeable
consequences
just
as
though
they
have
written
closed-shop
provisions
in
the
agreement.
before
i
sit
down,
however,
i
do
want
to
address
myself
to
another
aspect
of
this
case,
an
aspect
which
was
not
present
in
the
other
case
because
of
the
posture
in
which
this
case
arises.
as
i
said
earlier,
the
employers
here
did
not
agree
to
the
proposals.
they
resisted
and
the
union
went
out
on
strike
in
support
of
those
demands.
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
of
the
statute
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
union
to
restrain
or
coerce
an
employer
in
the
choice
of
representatives
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
or
the
adjustment
of
grievances.
now
here,
the
union
by
virtue
of
this
clause
was
attempting
to
restrict
the
employer's
choice
with
respect
to
the
foreman
and
the
foreman
is
conceded
on
all
sides.
it
would
have
been
management
representative
for
the
adjustment
of
grievances
that
it's
optimistic,
the
employer's
choice
of
representatives
for
purposes
of
grievance
to
employees
who
either
were
union
members
because
that
was
a
necessary
qualification
of
holding
the
job
of
foreman,
who
either
were
union
members
or
would
be
--
would
be
willing
to
become
union
members.
now,
we
think
that
this
clearly
falls
within
the
literal
proscription
of
section
8
(b)
(1)
(b)
that
they
were
circumscribing
the
employer's
choice
of
his
representatives
for
purposes
of
adjusting
grievances
and
as
the
court
below
properly
held
--
properly
held
this
constitutes
the
violation
of
that
section
of
the
statute.
with
respect
to
the
board's
order,
i
--
i
think
that
the
board's
order
does
not
--
does
not
as
suggested
here
preclude
--
preclude
the
union
from
incorporating
into
its
contracts,
provisions
of
the
general
laws
which
are
valid,
and
the
board's
decisions
in
these
cases
have
sustained,
was
well
afford
adequate
guides,
adequate
guides
to
the
union
as
to
which
provisions
are
to
be
--
can
be
included
in
the
contract
lawfully,
including
the
contract,
and
those
which
may
not
be.
thank
you.
