mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
may
it
please
--
please
the
court,
your
honor.
the
issues
in
this
case
are
very
similar
to
the
issues
which
were
involved
in
news
syndicate
in
which
your
honors
have
just
heard
argued.
in
november
of
1957,
after
some
years
of
efforts
to
obtain
a
satisfactory
agreement,
the
members
of
the
worcester
and
haverhill
typographical
unions
went
on
strike.
at
the
time
of
the
strike,
the
parties
were
barred
on
a
great
many
issues
concerning
most
of
which
no
legal
issue
was
ever
raised.
after
charges
have
been
filed
by
the
publishers
and
after
the
usual
proceedings
before
the
board,
the
board
found
that
the
commands
of
the
union
were
unlawful
in
five
respects.
they
held
unlawful
a
jurisdiction
clause
what
the
board
characterized
as
the
apprenticeship
and
priority
systems
of
the
agreement,
the
so-called
general
laws
clause
and
the
“foreman
clauses”
of
the
agreement.
the
board
entered
its
usual
cease-and-desist
orders
and
directed
the
usual
affirmative
action.
and
on
petition
to
review
and
cross
petitions
to
enforce,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
set
aside
the
board's
order
insofar
as
it
was
found
unlawful
the
jurisdiction
clause
and
the
apprenticeship
and
priority
systems.
but
the
court
below
did
sustain
the
board
involving
illegal
or
general
laws
clause
and
the
“foreman
clause”.
the
board
did
not
seek
certiorari
with
respect
to
the
first
three
issues.
the
only
two
issues
before
the
court
therefore
or
the
two
principle
issues
before
the
court
relate
to
the
validity
of
the
general
laws
clause
and
the
“foreman
clauses.”
before
getting
to
these
specific
clauses,
i
would
like
to
sketch
before
your
honors
a
little
background.
in
1957,
the
board
had
before
it
a
report
of
a
trial
examiner
which
found
that
a
contract
substantially
similar
to
the
contract
proposals
made
by
the
unions
here
was
lawful
and
that
the
practices
under
that
contract
had
been
lawful.
the
board
at
that
time
took
no
issue
with
this
holding
of
the
trial
examiner.
in
1950
--
that
was
in
1957.
in
1959,
the
board
decided
matter
of
honolulu
star
bulletin.
in
that
case,
the
board
did
not
decide
that
the
practice
is
under
a
substantially
identical
agreement
were
unlawful.
it
did,
however,
set
the
contract
aside
as
being
an
unlawful
close
chart.
now
in
that
case,
the
contract
contained
on
its
face
a
provision
which
said
that
the
term
journeyman
and
apprentice
has
used
herein,
that
is
in
the
agreement,
shall
not
be
taken
to
refer
exclusively
to
members
of
the
international
typographical
union.
now
manifestly,
the
parties
are
not
required
as
a
condition
of
maintaining
lawful
agreements
to
negative
on
their
face
and
intention
to
discriminate.
this
would
be
tantamount
to
saying
that
every
commercial
agreement
violates
the
antitrust
acts
which
fails
to
state
on
its
face
that
the
parties
do
not
intend
to
violate
the
sherman
and
clayton
antitrust
acts.
but
in
this
case,
the
parties
had
taken
this
additional
step
which
we
think
is
not
required
by
the
statute.
there
was
a
showing
that
a
substantial
number
of
nonunion
men
had
actually
been
hired.
the
board
nonetheless
treated
it
as
a
closed-shop
agreement.
and
the
case
is
instructive,
i
suggest,
is
demonstrating
the
way
in
which
the
board
is
prepared
to
toss
the
epithet
closed-shop
around
as
a
substitute
for
evidence
and
findings.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
had
no
trouble
with
the
case.
they
found
the
contract
to
be
lawful
on
its
face.
the
board
did
not
seek
certiorari.
and
as
your
honors
have
just
heard
after
the
most
careful
scrutiny,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
news
syndicate
found
that
contracts
which
have
been
in
effect
for
some
years
substantially
identical
with
the
proposals
herein
made
by
the
local
unions,
had
been
lawfully
administered.
now,
i
stress
that
this
is
a
completely
random
sample.
these
cases
came
up
only
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
at
these
particular
places,
some
employees
had
happened
to
file
charges.
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
further
that
these
cases
are
dispositive
of
this
case.
because
if
there
is
a
rule
of
law
that
is
well
said,
it
is
that
if
it
can
be
shown
that
a
contract
can
be
lawfully
administered
as
these
three
cases
demonstrate.
it
is
to
be
presume
that
it
will
be
lawfully
administered
unless
the
contrary
clearly
appears
and
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
to
the
contract.
the
local
negotiators
at
all
times
insisted
that
their
contract
proposals
were
lawful
and
that
they
intended
that
they'd
be
lawfully
applied.
the
significant
difference
obviously
between
these
three
cases
and
the
case
that
bar
here
is
that
here
we
deal
with
proposals
made
in
the
course
of
collective
negotiations
rather
than
with
agreements
which
had
been
in
effect
for
some
years
so
that
actual
practices
under
those
agreements
could
be
reviewed.
the
board
and
the
court
below
were
therefore
constrained
to
indulge
in
some
extremely
freewill
in
speculation
as
to
how
these
contract
proposals
might
have
been
lawfully
--
unlawfully
applied
if
they
had
been
found
acceptable
by
the
publishers.
and
for
present
purposes,
i
am
concerned
only
with
their
speculations
with
respect
to
the
general
laws
clause
and
the
foreman
clause.
the
general
laws
clause
reads
that
the
general
laws
would
be
itu
in
effect
at
the
time
of
execution
of
this
agreement,
not
in
conflict
with
federal
or
state
law
shall
govern
relations
between
the
parties
on
those
subjects
concerning
which
no
provision
is
made
on
the
contract.
now,
it
is
not
disputed
that
certain
general
laws
of
the
itu
contemplate
closed-shop
conditions.
it
is
equally
undisputed
that
each
of
those
laws
has
a
valid
field
of
application
in
enterprises
not
affecting
interstate
commerce
of
which
there
are
many
in
the
printing
industry
and
in
cannon
where
the
itu
has
many
local
unions.
and
it
is
--
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
i
--
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
i've
seen
agreements
in
canada
which
do
not
contain
this
language
not
in
conflict
with
federal
or
state
law.
it
is
not
disputed
that
that
phrase
“not
in
conflict
with
federal
or
state
law”
was
introduced
into
this
traditional
clause
immediately
after
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
and
the
testimony
in
this
case
is
entirely
clear
that
it
was
designed
to
have
precisely
the
effect
which
one
would
gather
from
its
language.
namely,
to
exclude
from
the
agreement
any
general
law
in
circumstances
in
which
its
enforcement
would
lead
to
a
violation
of
federal
law.
now
the
finding
of
the
--
or
i
should
add
further
that
in
1951,
the
general
laws
themselves
were
amended
to
add
article
14
which
provides
that
the
general
--
that
in
circumstances
in
which
the
enforcement
or
observance
of
any
general
law
would
lead
to
a
violation
of
federal
or
state
law,
such
general
law
is
suspended.
and
though
this
clause
has
been
in
use
since
passage
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
the
board
has
never
yet
alleged
or
proved
that
any
general
law
has,
in
fact,
ever
been
unlawfully
applied
despite
the
amount
of
litigation
that
there
has
been
involving
these
agreements.
now,
in
finding
of
the
trial
examiner
which
was
adopted
by
the
board
was
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
remotely
suggesting
that
the
respondent
unions
were
not
seeking
to
incorporate
in
their
agreement
all
of
the
general
laws
including
those
found
illegal
herein.
that
is
to
say
those
which
would
provide
for
closed-shop
conditions.
the
finding
of
a
trial
examiner
thus
directly
at
variance
with
the
clear
language
of
the
clause
and
with
the
testimony
explaining
its
purpose
for
inclusion
in
the
agreement.
now
an
essential
qualification
to
become
a
printer
is
that
one
be
able
to
read.
and
if
as
i
think
we
can
and
must,
we
assume
a
higher
degree
of
literacy
on
the
part
of
employees
in
this
industry
that
is
represented
by
this
finding
which
the
board
adopted.
this
case
will
give
your
honors
a
little
trouble.
needless
to
say,
the
court
below
did
not
adopt
so
palpably
erroneous
finding
that
went
almost
as
far,
however,
by
saying
that
this
proviso
obviously
designed
to
exclude
language
from
the
agreement
was
in
fact
language
of
incorporation
by
reference.
chief
judge
prettyman
on
a
honolulu
star-bulletin
gave
we
think
the
clear
answer
to
this.
he
said
in
speaking
of
this
clause
that
it
clearly
provided
that
the
general
laws
of
the
union
in
conflict
with
either
federal
law
or
the
contract
itself
were
not
included
in
the
contract.
a
closed-shop
provision
would
have
been
in
conflict
with
the
federal
law
and
also
in
conflict
with
section
2
(a)
of
the
contract.
any
such
provision
in
the
general
laws
was
accepted
from
inclusion
in
the
contract.
we
do
not
see
how
language
could
have
been
clearer.
now,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
this
is
not
only
the
lawyer
like
but
the
common
sense
way
of
reading
the
language
of
this
clause.
the
real
thrust
of
the
board's
opinion
in
this
case
and
of
the
court
below
has
been
the
assertion
that
because
employees
might
be
in
--
uncertain
as
to
which
of
the
general
laws
were
included
and
which
were
not
included,
that
this
uncertainty
is
the
equivalent
is
illegality.
now,
your
honors,
in
the
case
last
year,
steel
workers
case,
developed
at
great
length
the
reasons
why
collective
agreements
of
necessity
contained
large
areas
of
uncertainty
and
why
provisions
for
arbitrating
them
are
therefore
essential.
i
put
it
to
your
honors
in
all
seriousness
that
nothing
could
be
more
destructive
of
the
institution
of
collective
bargaining
and
nothing
could
be
more
productive
of
industrial
strife
than
the
adoption
of
the
rule
here
put
forward
by
the
board.
if
the
parties
to
collective
agreements
are
required
to
draft
them
with
such
specificity
that
not
only
the
board
and
not
only
the
courts,
but
a
group
of
unidentified,
illiterate,
suspicious
employees
must
be
satisfied
that
their
rights
can
under
no
circumstances
be
infringed
under
such
an
agreement,
then
collective
bargaining
becomes
a
manifest
impossibility
and
when
on
top
of
that,
when
the
penalty
for
leaving
any
lingering
uncertainty
on
the
agreement
is
the
application
of
the
brown-olds
remedy
as
the
board
has
proposed
in
these
cases.
collective
bargaining
then,
becomes
a
means
of
soliciting
a
fine
unless
the
parties
can
anticipate
all
the
myriad
situations
which
may
arise
under
the
agreement,
may
supply
answers,
so
clearly
lawful
that
no
employee
can
possibly
have
any
doubts
that
this
is
the
correct
answer.
chief
judge
prettyman
on
this
and
honolulu
star-bulletin
said
some
--
used
language
which
we
think
is
fundamentally
important
not
only
to
this
case
but
to
all
collective
bargaining
he
said.
the
board
says
that
since
the
contract
mentions
the
rules
of
the
union,
employees
would
have
the
impression
that
the
rules
were
incorporated
in
there
entirely
and
would
not
differentiate
those
contrary
to
law
or
to
the
contrary.
from
that
premise,
the
board
reasons
that
the
contract
is
per
se
a
closed-shop
contract.
this
conclusion
is
a
complete
known
sacred.
an
erroneous
impression
of
plain
terms
does
not
change
the
meaning
of
the
plain
terms.
furthermore,
assumptions
that
employees
will
not
understand
a
lawful
contract
cannot
be
the
basis
for
holding
the
contract
illegal.
what
would
be
the
justification
for
emphatic
insistence
upon
formal
collective
bargaining
as
to
terms
of
employment
if
the
conduct
of
the
parties
thereafter
is
to
be
judged
by
speculative,
uninformed
impressions
of
those
terms
instead
of
by
the
terms
themselves
has
hammered
out
at
the
negotiation
table.
i
put
it
to
your
honor
that
this
is
the
way
a
lawyer
--
this
is
the
lawyer
like
approach
to
this
problem.
indeed,
in
its
brief
here,
the
board
appears
to
concede
that
lawyers
and
judges
would
read
this
agreement
to
be
lawful.
i
will
not
conceal
my
hope
that
at
least
five
judges
and
preferably
nine,
will
read
it
to
be
lawful.
i
repeat.
that
is
impossible
for
the
parties
to
meet
the
standard
which
they
say
collective
bargaining
requires
if
agreements
are
to
be
lawful.
i
turn
them
to
the
speculations
concerning
the
foreman
clauses
in
this
agreement.
the
clauses
as
proposed
below,
proposed
in
the
negotiations
read
as
follows.
the
operation
authority
hiring
for
and
control
of
each
compulsory
rule
shall
be
vested
exclusively
in
the
office
through
its
representative
the
foreman
who
shall
be
a
member
of
the
union.
the
union
shall
not
discipline
the
foreman
for
carrying
out
written
instructions
of
the
publisher
or
his
representatives
authorized
by
this
agreement.
the
holding
of
the
board
on
this
issue
was
that
these
clauses,
well
in
effect
“create
a
closed-shop”
because
they
say
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
foreman
would
consider
himself
bound
by
the
rules
of
the
union
calling
for
a
closed-shop
agreement
and
that
these
are
therefore
illegal.
we
say
there
are
the
most
compelling
reasons
for
making
the
directly
opposite
presumption.
but
first
and
most
important
and
we
suggest
dispositive
is
the
presumption
that
the
citizen
will
obey
the
law
since
the
statute
forbids
discrimination
higher,
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
the
foreman,
whoever
he
may
be,
union
or
nonunion,
would
place
the
statute
above
any
union
rules.
second
with
almost
equal
importance
is
the
agreement
itself.
the
agreement
as
proposed
by
these
local
unions
would
have
setup
standards
that
were
higher
which
were
completely
none
discriminatory,
which
were
based
solely
on
competence
and
experience,
which
had
no
relation
whatsoever
to
union
membership
or
non-membership.
the
laws
clause
which
i
read
to
your
honors
makes
it
entirely
clear
that
the
contract
prevails
over
any
inconsistent
general
law,
so
if
the
publishers
had
accepted
these
proposals,
the
foreman
would
have
been
told
directly
on
the
face
of
the
agreement
by
which
of
course
he
would
be
bound
but
he
was
not
expected
to
follow
discriminatory
methods
higher.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
the
four
separate
occasions
and
methods
by
which
the
itu
has
notified
those
of
its
members
who
are
foreman
that
they
are
not
expected
to
discriminate
them
higher.
the
board
seems
to
fill
that
four
times
is
not
enough
whether
its
6',
8',
10'
would
or
would
not
be,
we
don't
know.
apparently,
they
consider
such
a
declaration
effective
only
if
it
is
compelled
by
a
board
order.
the
most
significant
aspect
of
the
board's
brief
on
this
problem
is
that
they
failed
even
to
mention
the
amendments
to
the
act
in
1947
in
sections
23
--
211
and
14
(a)
by
which
the
congress
made
it
entirely
clear
that
foremen
were
no
longer
employees
under
the
act,
that
the
employer
was
free
to
discriminate
as
he
like
with
respect
to
the
union
membership
or
nonmembership
of
his
foremen.
the
congress
at
that
time
made
it
entirely
plain
that
a
requirement
that
a
foreman
be
a
union
member
was
not
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
and
it
is
therefore
irrelevant
as
the
court
below
found
that
the
effect
of
this
clause
might
be
to
encourage
aspirins
for
the
foreman
job
to
join
the
union.
since
in
radio
officers,
your
honors
made
it
entirely
clear
that
it
is
not
enough
to
show
encouragement
but
that
this
encouragement
must
be
achieved
by
discrimination.
and
this
requirement
is
not
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(a)
(3).
indeed,
if
i
may
digress
for
a
moment,
your
honors,
i
suggest
that
in
all
of
the
cases
presently
before
your
honor
--
your
honors,
a
misreading
by
the
board
of
radio
officers
lies
at
the
heart
of
all
the
difficulties.
they
have
attempted
to
read
out
of
the
statute
the
words
by
the
discrimination
to
find
that
anything
which
encourages
union
membership
is
per
se
a
violation
of
the
act
and
that
therefore
there
is
no
longer
any
need
to
find
discrimination.
your
honors
made
it
entirely
clear
in
radio
officers
and
the
whole
history
of
the
act
bears
it
out,
that
the
first
essential
is
to
find
discrimination
and
if
that
is
lacking
then
the
question
of
discouragement
or
encouragement
of
union
membership
does
not
arise.
for
these
reasons,
we
say
that
those
clauses
were
lawful.
i
will
leave
to
our
brief
the
question
whether
or
not
the
board
and
the
court
below
properly
held
that
both
the
international
typographical
union
and
the
local
unions
could
at
one
in
the
same
time
be
the
exclusive
representative
of
these
particular
employees.
in
order
to
say
a
word
about
board's
order
in
this
case.
the
board's
order
here
forbids
the
respondents
to
insist
on
a
laws
clause.
your
honors
will,
i
hope
find
instructive
appendix
b
to
our
principal
brief
in
this
case.
on
this
and
the
following
pages,
we
have
set
forth
in
tabular
form,
the
general
laws
which
have
been
attacked
in
all
of
the
various
cases
which
have
been
brought
involving
this
issue.
your
honors
will
observe
that
those
attack
range
from
zero
to
37
plus,
but
the
significant
thing
is
that
no
two
of
them
ever
agreed.
the
board
personnel
constantly
varies
its
positions
as
to
what's
lawful
and
what's
unlawful.
significantly,
however,
this
chart
shows
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
general
laws
have
not
been
attacked
in
this
or
any
other
proceeding.
now,
we
say
that
in
saying
that
we
may
not
use
the
laws
clause,
it
is
therefore
entirely
clear
that
the
board
is
trying
to
throw
out
lawful
conduct
as
well
as
conduct
which
they
say
unlawful.
your
honors'
opinions
make
it
entirely
clear.
we
think
that
this
is
something
which
the
board
may
not
do.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
in
this
case
and
in
number
339,
the
numerous
additional
reasons
for
objecting
to
the
decisions
and
order
of
the
board
in
this
case.
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated
here
and
for
the
reasons
stated
in
that
brief,
we
urge
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
the
court
please.
what
mr.
manoli
has
said
with
reference
to
the
foreman
issue
makes
it
necessary,
i
think,
to
review
somewhat
the
actual
facts
with
reference
to
that
matter.
that
both
worcester
and
haverhill
had
not
been
for
some
years
any
collective
agreement
in
effect.
the
employer
by
his
unilateral
choice
had
a
union
foreman
and
he
delegated
to
that
union
foreman
exactly
the
powers
which
the
contract
proposals
asked
that
foreman
exercise.
now,
the
union's
proposals,
as
i
have
said,
called
for
nondiscriminatory
standards
of
hiring.
what
the
union
was
therefore
proposing
was
that
though
there
had
been
up
to
that
time
a
complete
delegation
of
authority
to
the
foreman
by
the
employer's
unilateral
act,
the
union
was
proposing
in
the
contracts
which
it
presented
the
setting
up
of
nondiscriminatory
standards
for
hire
which
would
be,
as
i
have
suggested
binding
on
the
employer.
this
we
say
is
clearly
in
aid
of
the
statutory
purpose.
there
was
no
effort
here
at
all
to
influence
in
any
way
let
alone
restrain
or
coerce
the
employer
in
his
selection
of
representative
for
collective
bargaining.
the
employers
of
both
haverhill
and
worcester
has
union
foreman.
at
haverhill
there
was
not
even
an
objection
to
this
clause
being
--
going
into
the
agreement.
and
in
both
cases,
therefore,
the
union
made
no
objection
to
the
foreman
of
whom
the
employer
then
had,
and
therefore
there
was
no
effort
to
influence
let
alone
restrain
or
coerce
the
employer
in
the
selection
of
his
representative
to
represent
him.
now
with
respect
to
the
laws
clause,
the
uncertainty
argument,
there
is
one
additional
point
which
i
would
like
to
draw
to
the
court's
attention.
the
board's
traditional
technique
and
the
notices
which
it
directs
to
be
posted,
always
declare
that
the
parties
are
not
to
violate
the
act,
not
to
discriminate
“except
to
the
extent
permitted
by
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
now,
in
that
single
phrase,
the
board
subsumes
all
of
the
doctrinal
law
with
reference
to
dual
union
membership,
payment
of
dues,
check
off
arrangements,
and
the
myriad
other
subjects
with
which
the
board
is
dealt.
the
board
is
entirely
satisfied
with
this
kind
of
an
arrangement
and
we
have
suggested
that
the
words
not
in
conflict
with
law
in
the
laws
clause
are
at
least
as
reassuring
to
employees
as
technical
language
such
as
except
to
the
extent
permitted
by
section
8
(a)
(3).
as
chief
judge
prettyman
noted
in
the
honolulu
star
case,
the
board
twice
in
a
notice
to
all
employees
which
it
required
to
be
posted,
directs
the
company
to
recite
adjuration
of
certain
activities
“except
to
the
extent
permitted
by
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act”.
counsel
pointed
the
queries
whether
the
latter
quoted
expression
is
less
confusing
than
the
phrase
“not
in
conflict
with
law”.
we
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
the
drafting
of
a
contract,
we're
within
our
rights
in
using
a
shorthand
device,
precisely
the
kind
which
the
board
itself
uniformly
uses
in
the
notices
to
employees
which
it
directs
to
the
posting.
your
honors
have
had
represented
to
you
here
in
the
course
of
the
argument
in
the
local
357
case
that
the
mountain
pacific
doctrine
is
applicable
solely
to
exclusively
union
operated
hiring
halls.
now,
in
the
news
syndicate
case,
the
hiring
in
that
case
was
done
by
a
foreman
on
the
employer's
premises.
there
was
no
hiring
hall
exclusive
or
non-exclusive.
the
board
nevertheless
attempted
to
apply
its
mountain
pacific
doctrine
in
that
news
syndicate
case
to
a
case
where
there
was
no
kind
of
hiring
hall
whatsoever.
and
despite
the
representations
which
were
made
in
the
courts
below
and
in
this
court
that
mountain
pacific
is
a
doctrine
which
is
limited
solely
to
hiring
halls.
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
the
only
conclusion
that
can
be
drawn
from
this
is
that
the
board
is
unable
to
distinguish
between
a
foreman
and
the
hiring
hall.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
in
the
cases
you
have
heard
here
in
the
last
days,
there
is
one
common
thread
which
runs
through
them
all
and
which
we
think
is
dispositive
of
all.
and
that
is
the
question
whether
or
not
unions
and
union
members
are
entitled
to
the
normal
presumption
of
law
that
if
they
have
a
power,
they
will
exercise
it
lawfully.
the
board's
approach
in
all
of
these
matters
is
to
start
with
the
assumption
that
if
a
union
is
given
a
power
whether
it
is
a
power
over
seniority,
over
apprenticeships,
over
methods
of
hire,
over
a
hiring
hall,
over
a
foreman,
that
those
powers
will
probably
be
exercised
in
unlawful
fashion,
that
therefore
the
board
can
assert
a
right
to
strike
down
these
powers
in
the
hands
of
the
union.
for
example,
if
we
had
undertaken
to
follow
the
technique
which
the
board
used
here
in
its
hiring
hall
cases,
we
would
have
searched
the
board's
records
for
300
or
400
cases
in
which
nonunion
foremen
have
discriminated
against
nonunion
members.
we
would
then
add
an
elaborate
tribute
to
our
own
expertise
and
we'd
say
that
this
demonstrates
conclusively
that
the
only
reason
that
employers
hire
nonunion
foremen
is
in
order
that
they
may
discriminate
against
union
members
and
hiring.
we
would
then
use
this
as
a
basis
for
asserting
that
we
had
the
power
to
forbid
the
employer
to
hire
a
nonunion
foreman
and
having
the
power
to
forbid
him
to
do
so,
we
could
impose
any
conditions
that
we
like
on
the
employer's
hiring
of
a
nonunion
foreman.
once
you
start
with
the
presumption
that
unions
and
union
members
are
as
intent
on
obeying
the
law
as
employers
are,
then
the
resting
of
power
in
unions
to
control
certain
industrial
matters
presents
no
further
problem.
we
say
that
as
citizens,
we
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
this
presumption
as
much
as
an
employer,
a
nonunion
foreman
or
anyone
else.
