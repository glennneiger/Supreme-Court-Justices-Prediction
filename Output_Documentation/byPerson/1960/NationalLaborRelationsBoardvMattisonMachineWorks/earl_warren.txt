--
chief
justice
earl
warren

at
the
outset,
would
you
mind
saying
whether

issue
in
this
case
other
than
the
so-called
misnomer
of
the
--
of
the
company
at
which
the
election
is
being
held.

we
bound
by
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,

we
talking
now
about
what's
in
the
record
or
what's
out
of
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
is
this
--
but
where
is
this?
chief
justice
earl

earl
warren
where
is
it
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well

you
want
us
to
consider
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
in
the
letter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have

you're
going
to
argue
it,
you

one
then.

justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
other
company
by
a
similar
name
to
that
in
which
the
election
was
called
that
these
people
could
get
confused
with?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
would
it
--
how
would
it
confuse
them
and
how
would
they
--
how
would
they
get
hurt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what's
the
prejudice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
that
doesn't
answer
it
though
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
that
caused
by
--
by
this
misnomer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understood,
mr.
counsel,
when
you
made
your
first
objection
to
the
board,
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
mention
this
misnomer
at
all
and
it
was
sent
two
weeks
later
that
you
wrote
a
letter
and
said,
"now,
there's
another
objection
to
this
which
is
a
misnomer."
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl

--
that's
not
what
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.

talking
about
when
you
--
when
you
made
formal
objection
to

towards

chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
--
your
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
--
you
didn't
include
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
did
you
write
the
subsequent
letter
then,
saying
that
in
addition
to
--
to
what
you
had
objected
to
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
that
one
--
where
does
that
appear
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
in
that
--
in
that
document,
do
you
--
do
you
raise
objection
because
of
the
misnomer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
in
--
that's
what
i
want
to
see.
