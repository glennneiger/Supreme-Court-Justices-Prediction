mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
there
are
two
points
to
be
argued
before
this
court.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
has
no
connection
whatsoever
with
the
celanese
corporation
case.
that
is
a
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
board
or
counsel
for
the
board.
this
case
is
a
serious
case
and
the
involvement
is
such
that
it
does
deserve
your
honors
careful
attention.
but
we
do
not
agree
as
to
the
questions
that
are
involved
before
this
court
and
if
i
may
burden
you
with
counsel
slot
for
the
respondent.
and
for
the
purposes
of
accuracy,
i
pray
you
to
let
me
read
the
question
that
respondent
contends
before
this
court.
whether
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
view
of
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
case
correctly
employed
its
equitable
powers
in
denying
a
--
the
petition
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
an
enforcement
order
and
in
remanding
the
case
to
that
board
for
another
election.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
no
--
that
was
the
question
involved
from
our
point
of
view
that's
before
this
court.
they
have
an
--
an
entirely
different
view
point.
we
do
not
agree.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
question
of
judicial
review.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
they
seem
to
have
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
their
brief
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
their
brief
is
slightly
different.
the
question
for
certiorari,
they
complained
in
--
in
their
brief
in
that
case,
they
complained
about
the
judicial
reviewing
authority
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals.
but
now
they're
back
on
a
different
question
and
they
are
belaboring
the
point
of
the
non-prejudicial
misnomer.
well,
that's
only
of
the
issues.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
no,
that
isn't
true,
your
honor,
justice
harlan.
no,
that
isn't
our
contention
whatsoever.
in
my
opinion,
the
national
labor
relations
board
counsel
or
the
solicitor
general
for
the
board
is
trying
to
make
the
point
in
his
brief
and
i
intended
to
read
from
it
so
as
to
be
sure
that
i'm
exact.
contends
in
his
brief
whether
the
court
below
had
erred
in
setting
aside
the
representation
of
the
last
election
because
the
employer's
name
appeared
on
the
election
notice
and
ballots
as
mattison
machinery
manufacturing
company
instead
of
as
mattison
machine
works,
where
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
found
that
there
was
no
contention
and
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
error
in
nomenclature
confused
either
the
employer
or
the
employees
involved
or
was
in
any
respect
prejudicial.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
that's
right.
but
in
their
--
in
their
briefs,
in
support
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
they
were
complaining
about
the
court's
judicial
review
and
in
this
brief,
they're
talking
about
the
non-prejudicial
misnomer
in
the
name.
now,
in
--
in
the
case
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
there
was
two
points
made.
number
one,
the
misnomer
in
the
name
of
the
company,
and
number
two,
the
fact
that
two
eligible
employees
were
not
allowed
to
vote.
the
courts
of
equity
is
(inaudible)
requiring
that
you
must
first
do
equity
if
you
seek
equity.
the
employer-appellee
in
this
case,
filed
objections
to
the
conduct
of
the
election
or
the
conduct
of
the
ballot
and
objections
to
conduct
affecting
the
results
of
the
ballot.
the
same
were
filed
and
there
was
a
request
for
a
conference
and
the
conference
was
not
held
until
sometime
later,
august
the
20th
to
be
exact.
counsel
for
respondent
requested
a
hearing
on
the
objections
and
also
requested
a
new
election.
the
hearing
on
the
objections
was
denied
by
the
regional
director.
reason,
not
guilty.
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
there
were
two
employees
who
had
not
been
allowed
to
vote
or
were
not
even
given
a
ballot
to
vote
under
challenge,
if
you
please,
was
reserved
by
the
regional
director
with
the
words
that
he
would
wait
to
see
what
his
investigation
reveal.
and
if
in
fact
those
two
employees
were
eligible
workers
and
should've
been
allowed
to
vote,
he
would
throw
the
election
out.
the
result
was,
there
was
no
decision
with
respect
to
the
two
employees
and
the
election
was
not
thrown
out.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
i
did.
it
was
at
a
conference
in
the
regional
director's
office?
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
there
is
nothing
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
the
meeting
on
august
the
20th
between
the
regional
director
of
the
13th
region
and
myself.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
your
honor,
on
august
the
22nd,
two
days
later,
i
wrote
a
letter.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
we're
going
to
talk
about
what's
in
the
record
and
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
the
conversation?
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
on
august
22nd
is
when
i
wrote
the
letter.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
the
counsel
referred
to.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
the
letter
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
it's
referred
to
in
the
--
it's
referred
to
--
all
through
the
case,
the
letter
of
august
the
22nd
but
it's
not
in
there
as
a
piece
of
evidence.
and
counsel
admits
that
the
letter
was
received
and
the
matter
was
discussed.
the
fact
of
the
misnomer
of
the
two
companies
and
that
results
from
the
conference
that
was
held
on
august
the
20th
because
i
first
asked
for
a
hearing
on
the
objections
which
were
denied.
then
i
asked
for
a
new
election
and
he
gave
me
the
evasive
answer
that
if
he,
on
his
investigation,
found
these
two
people
were
eligible
voters,
he
would
throw
the
election
out
or
no
election.
we
also
discussed
the
fact
that
25
people
did
not
vote
and
that
they
were
confused
by
reason
of
the
specimen
ballots.
the
notices
of
election
were
all
addressed
to
employees
of
--
of
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
that
was
in
--
in
the
letter?
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
no,
sir.
now,
on
august
the
22nd
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
where
is
the
letter?
it's
in
the
office
of
the
regional
director.
i
would
assume,
of
the
13th
region.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
the
letter?
well,
they
admit
the
fact
that
the
letter
was
received.
there
is
no
contention
that
the
letter
was
not
written.
the
letter
was
written
as
a
matter
of
defense
by
me
because
when
i
returned
from
the
conference
on
the
20th,
i
knew
i
was
in
for
it
so
i
wanted
to
make
a
record
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
official
notification
that
this
misnomer
had
effect
on
the
employees,
so
i
wrote
the
letter.
now,
what
happened?
i
had
previously,
on
july
the
7th
--
on
july
the
8th,
that
a
conference
that
was
called
by
the
regional
director
for
the
purpose
of
setting
up
this
election.
i
had
called
to
the
field
examiner
jewel
morrow's
(ph)
attention
that
the
name
of
the
company
was
wrong.
in
answer
to
her
first
question,
"what
is
the
corporate
name
of
the
company?"
i
told
her,
mattison
machine
works.
she
looked
up
at
me
entirely
and
she
says,
"i
think,
i
have
better
follow
the
union's
petition."
so
she
used
manufacturing
the
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company.
now,
they
have
added
in
appendix
to
their
brief.
and
on
page
23,
it's
definitely
her
responsibility
and
i
quote
--
let's
start
talking
about
notice
of
election
on
page
23
in
appendix
to
the
petition
of
the
board.
"but
the
basis
for
such
elect
--
action
is
the
election
order
sheet
prepared
by
the
assigned
board
agent
and
the
responsibility
for
the
accuracy
of
the
finished
notice
of
election
is
his."
in
this
case,
hers,
but
she
refused
to
change
the
name
of
the
company.
well,
that
was
on
july
of
the
8th.
on
august
the
28th,
i
had
the
conference
and
was
denied
for
hearing.
i
was
also
denied
a
new
election
contingent
upon
his
investigation.
on
november
the
19th,
the
regional
director
got
around
to
filing
his
report
and
i
am
now
reading
from
page
20
of
the
transcript
before
you.
referring
to
a
reference
to
the
--
to
its
communication
of
august
22nd,
1957.
the
company
states
that
it
advised
the
board
agent
of
the
proper
corporate
name
during
the
conference
at
which
the
election
details
were
discussed
because
in
the
company's
opinion,
the
ballots
have
to
carry
the
correct
authorization
that
there
was
to
be
any
contract
negotiated.
the
board
agent
who
conducted
the
pre-election
conference
has
no
recollection
if
there
ever
having
been
any
discussion
on
such
occasion
concerning
the
proper
corporate
title.
we
submitted
in
this
connection
two
affidavits
of
two
people
who
were
present
at
that
conference
as
to
what
the
conversation
was.
they
are
in
appendix
to
my
brief
for
the
respondent,
affidavits
one
and
two.
from
the
foregoing,
reading
on
the
regional
director's
report,
"it
is
evident
that
the
extent
of
the
corporate
misnomer
was
the
use
of
the
words,
"manufacturing
company"
instead
of
--
instead
of
"manufacturing
machine
works,"
appearing
on
the
notice
of
election,
sample
ballot,
the
ballots
used
in
the
course
of
the
election
and
the
tally
of
ballot.
now,
as
proof
of
the
conversation
between
the
regional
director
and
myself,
and
he
knowing
fully
well
our
contention,
he
goes
on
and
says,
"a
misnomer
of
such
limited
extent
cannot
be
said
to
have
reasonably
intended
to
create
such
confusion
among
employees
involved
as
to
have
precluded
a
free
and
full
expression
in
the
casting
of
their
ballots.
so,
it
is
in
the
record
that
we
complained
and
the
regional
director
put
it
in
the
record
when
he
filed
his
report.
in
the
representation
case,
we
asked
for
a
hearing,
we
were
denied
that.
or
the
respondent
might
file
exceptions
and
objections
to
the
regional
director's
report
and
in
large
on
the
misnomer.
i
asked
for
a
hearing
on
my
exceptions
and
objections.
we
were
denied.
on
my
petition
for
review
of
the
board's
certification
despite
these
two
big
errors,
it
was
denied.
i
asked
for
a
rehearing
or
reconsideration
and
it
was
denied.
the
circuit
court
of
appeal
apparently
concluded
that
the
board
was
coming
before
it
with
unclean
hands.
they
haven't
certainly
done
equity.
they
wouldn't
even
hear
a
word
from
the
respondent
from
155
people
who
are
reported
to
have
voted
against
the
union
on
the
contention
that
the
misnomer
did
cause
confusion.
they
closed
the
iron
curtain
which
is
that
--
customarily
referred
to
as
administrative
procedure
because
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
latitude
allowed
to
a
regional
director
and
to
a
board
that
they
lowered
the
curtain,
i
couldn't
even
get
a
hearing,
i
couldn't
put
in
any
evidence
but
the
record
shows
that
the
matter
of
confusion
was
discussed
and
the
regional
director
brought
it
out
himself.
he
was
referring
to
it
in
his
report.
that
brings
me
to
the
question
--
of
the
question
that
they
show
in
their
brief
which
justice
douglas
has
--
says
it's
identical
and
it
appears
in
the
writ
of
--
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
before
it
had
found
that
there
was
no
contention
and
no
evidence
in
the
record.
that
is
an
illogical
conclusion
by
the
board
or
solicitor
general
who
prepared
the
brief.
the
matter
was
of
record
because
on
july
8,
i
told
the
field
examiner,
"change
the
name."
and
she
said,
"she'd
better
follow
the
petition
of
the
union."
on
august
the
28th,
i
asked
for
a
hearing
and
among
the
things
we
discussed
was
the
question
that
there
was
confusion
caused
by
notices
which
are
addressed
to
the
employees
of
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company.
that's
what
the
notice
of
election
granted.
the
specimen
ballot
was
addressed
to
the
employees
of
the
mattison
manufacturing
company.
the
confusion
was
caused
and
the
regional
director
knew
it
full
well
so
he
discussed
it
in
his
november
17th
or
november
19th
report
and
he
calls
it
a
misnomer
of
such
limited
extent
that
he
could
not
possibly
have
caused
confusion.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
i
don't
--
it
isn't
our
contention
that
there
was
a
similarity
in
name
and
i
don't
know
of
any
such,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
there
--
there
were
25
abstained
from
the
election.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
and
the
confusion
lies
in
the
fact
that
they
besiege
the
personnel
manager's
office
when
the
notices
were
posted
three
days
before
the
election
all
around
the
shop.
incidentally,
counsel
didn't
know
it
but
there
are
two
buildings
separated
by
a
railroad
track
but
the
notices
were
in
both
buildings.
and
it
created
such
confusion
that
he
had
an
avalanche
of
inquires.
"is
this
another
phony
labor
board
election?
i'm
going
fishing,
i
don't
want
any
part
of
it,"
and
comments
of
that
kind.
but
we
weren't
allowed
to
put
them
on
his
witnesses
or
we
couldn't
get
a
hearing.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
by
the
mis
--
the
--
on
the
bulletin
board,
it
says
notice
of
election
and
it's
addressed
to
the
employees
of
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company
and
i'm
working
in
matttison
machine
works
and
i
wonder
what's
going
on.
some
of
them
said,
"i
don't
want
any
part
of
it.
it
looks
like
a
phony."
but
we
couldn't
put
on
witnesses.
we
were
stopped
by
administrative
procedure
on
our
original
objections
to
the
election.
the
regional
director
decided
he
didn't
want
to
hear
anything.
i
enlarged
on
the
misnomer
and
thought
it
filed
exceptions
and
objections
to
the
regional
director's
report.
and
i
asked
the
board
for
hearing
and
i
was
denied
that.
so,
where
can
we
get
anything?
before
the
court
accepts
until
we
get
to
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
is
a
court
of
law,
so
that
was
a
complaint
case.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
no.
correcting
you,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
--
in
time
and
in
fact.
on
july
the
8th,
two
weeks
before
the
election
when
there'll
be
no
question
of
confusion,
i
told
the
board's
agent,
the
field
examiner,
"use
the
right
corporate
name."
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
i
couldn't
design
a
reason.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
yes,
sir,
that
was
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
--
29
days
to
be
exact
from
the
date
of
the
election.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
i
objected
to
the
use
of
the
wrong
name
but
i
did
not
say
that
caused
the
confusion.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
no,
the
letter
only
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
ballots,
specimen
ballots,
and
the
notices
of
election,
all
employed
the
wrong
name
and
were
addressed
to
the
employees
of
their
own
companies.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
that's
in
connection
with
the
appropriate
--
well,
counsel
very
kindly
called
the
attention
to
the
fact
--
counsel
very
generously
calls
attention
to
page
19
which
covers
the
report
and
objections
and
challenges.
and
it
recites
the
time
element
of
letters
and
other
things.
but
the
question
of
the
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
from
the
middle
of
that
first
paragraph
to
the
end
of
the
paragraph
is
the
direct
quotation
out
of
the
letter
on
page
19.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
now,
this
is
--
this
here
--
this
page
on
19
is
the
regional
director
talking.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
and
all
of
these
are
on
page
20
of
the
next
to
last
paragraph,
he
uses
the
bill
that
raises
the
confusion
because
he
knew
the
contention
because
of
our
conference
on
the
20th
but
that's
no
matter
of
record.
i
was
invited
to
his
office
for
the
purposes
of
conferring
about
the
objections
of
the
election
or
anything
else
that
came
up.
and
i
asked
first
the
hearing
on
the
objections
and
it
was
denied.
i
asked
secondly
for
a
new
election
and
he
says,
"well,
that
all
depends
upon
how
my
investigation
shows
up
on
these
two
men
that
you
claim
were
eligible
to
vote.
if
they
were
in
fact
eligible
to
work
--
vote,
i'll
throw
the
election
out."
but
if
also
in
that
conference
was
very
clearly
given
across
to
the
regional
director,
the
contention
that
25
people
stayed
away
from
the
election,
two,
because
they
were
denied
the
right
to
vote
and
23
because
they
were
confused
about
the
issue
and
wanted
no
part
of
it,
and
they
so
expressed
themselves.
he
would
hold
no
hearing
but
he
was
fully
informed
as
to
the
contention
of
the
company
and
he
admits
it
on
page
20
when
he
says,
"on
misnomer
of
such
limited
extent,
cannot
be
said
to
have
reasonably
tendered
to
create
such
confusion
among
employees
involved."
he
raises
the
question
himself
because
he
knew
it
was
a
contention
but
he
haven't
decided
not
to
give
me
hearings
all
the
way
along
the
line.
he
subsequently,
by
administrative
procedure,
i
was
denied
hearings
--
and
for
the
hearings
and
i
couldn't
get
anything
in.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
complaint
case?
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
i
did.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
at
the
time
we
have
the
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
we
had
nothing
before
us
so
we
disposed
the
--
the
original
notice
for
the
first
hearing
was
in
the
wrong
of
the
company
and
it
was
told
to
the
field
examiner
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
--
that
was
different.
there's
was
no
motion
made.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
that
is
correct,
we
have
such.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
no
motion
was
made
and
i
read
to
you
an
excerpt
from
the
n.l.r.b.
manual,
put
in
their
brief
as
an
appendix.
it
was
her
responsibility.
they
complained
that
i
made
no
motion,
no
formal
motion
but
it's
not
my
responsibility
to
make
a
formal
motion.
i
read
from
the
n.l.r.b.
manual,
it
was
that
woman's
place
to
take
suggestion
and
use
the
correct
corporate
name.
why
did
she
ask
me
the
question?
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
that
hearing
was
transcribed.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
i
did
not
make
a
formal
motion.
no,
your
honor.
i
did
not.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
yes,
they
did.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company.
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
the
company
sent
the
papers
to
me.
now,
the
only
--
the
only
thing
is
that
--
the
only
thing
that
we're
talking
about
the
confusion
that
was
caused
was
in
the
minds
of
the
employees
who
went
fishing
and
wanted
no
part
of
it
because
it
looked
like
a
phony
and
it
was
a
close
election.
and
there
were
25
votes
that
certainly
would've
turned
the
tide
one
way
or
the
other
or
made
it
more
definite
one
way
or
the
other
because
25
refrained
away
from
voting.
the
reason?
unknown.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
now
--
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
the
most
flagrant
abuse
of
the
whole
case
is
the
denial
to
the
two
workers
of
their
right
to
vote.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
how
did
that
hurt
us?
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
you're
experiences
as
a
judge
--
justice
whittaker
but
they
lined
up
to
come
to
the
ballot
box
to
get
a
ballot
so
they're
standing
there
and
the
union
quite
to
the
contrary
to
something
counsel
said,
"the
union
wants
to
challenge
these
two
men
except
they
couldn't
vote."
but
the
field
examiner
who
was
over
zealous,
he
took
up
the
place
--
he
took
up
the
issue
from
thereon
and
he
says,
"you
cannot
vote."
and
he
said
he
gave
the
reason
that
the
name
was
drawn
through
the
--
a
line
was
drawn
through
their
names.
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
i
wasn't
there.
but
to
the
second
man,
he
says,
"you
cannot
vote
and
if
i
let
you
vote,
it
won't
do
you
any
good
anyway."
now,
he's
talking
to
a
group
of
people
who
are
lined
up
waiting
to
go
to
a
ballot
box.and
here
is
the
government's
agent,
throwing
his
weight
around
it
and
these
people
aren't
impressionable.
and
two
men
who
were
actually
our
only
workers
and
entitled
to
vote
were
not
allowed
their
opportunity
to
pick
their
own
bargaining
agent.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
they
would
not.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
but
they
--
the
--
the
act
influenced
the
thinking
of
others.
there
is
no
question
about
these
people
being
impressionable
and
it
was
done
right
then
and
there
on
the
spot.
mr.
j.
warren
mccaffrey
and
actually
--
actually,
there
was
never
a
decision
in
connection
with
the
two
workers.
let
me
show
you
how
the
board
cites
that
--
that
issue.
there
is
on
the
back
of
my
brief,
six
affidavits,
and
affidavits
three,
four,
five
and
six
have
to
do
with
the
conversation
that
took
place
at
the
time
these
two
illegible
workers
were
denied
the
right
to
vote.
now,
the
board
and
its
certification
comes
along
and
they
issue
an
order.
and
i
want
you
to
realize
what
they
said.
however,
we
need
not
to
cite
this
conflict
in
testimony
about
what
the
union
watcher
said
and
what
the
employer
watcher
said.
for
assuming
arguendo
that
these
two
employees
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
vote,
their
votes
would
not
have
been
sufficient
in
number
to
affect
the
results
of
the
election.
but
the
regional
director,
when
i
asked
for
a
new
election
said,
"i'll
see
what
my
investigation
reveals.
it
was
never
decided."
he
never
concluded
or
made
a
finding
that
they
were
eligible
or
not
eligible
but
look
at
the
demoralizing
effect
of
denying
two
eligible
workers
the
privilege
to
vote
and
the
regional
director's
field
examiner
taking
up
the
cudgels
for
the
union.
if
you
vote,
it
won't
do
you
any
good
anyway.
and
my
affidavit
is
the
record.
that's
what
the
conversation
was
about.
now,
the
big
point
about
the
two
people
not
being
allowed
to
vote,
it's
contrary
to
the
findings
and
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
free
choice
of
bargaining
representative.
it's
contrary
to
section
7
of
the
act,
free
choice
of
bargaining
representative.
these
two
fellows
have
no
choice
in
the
matter.
and
it
is
also
contrary
to
the
intention
of
congress
in
adopting
the
act.
they
wanted
free,
untrammeled,
unbiased,
unprejudiced
elections
in
which
the
worker
could
come
in
and
make
his
own
selection
of
bargaining
agents.
but
if
the
field
examiner
says,
"you
can
vote
and
you
cannot
vote."
that's
entire
usurpation
of
power.
i
referred
to
their
appendix.
they
have
the
labor
board
manual
and
i
call
your
attention
to
page
21
where
it's
speaking
about
the
--
their
own
exhibits,
speaking
about
the
field
examiner.
they
said,
"normally,
the
board
agent
should
be
present."
this
is
at
a
free
election
check
but
he's
also
present
at
the
election,
“to
assist
in
the
resolution
of
disagreements”.
i'm
reading."
he
should
make
it
clear
that
he
has
no
authority
to
find
an
individual
eligible
or
ineligible
to
vote."
now,
they're
complaining
about
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
over
stepping
its
ground
and
raising
some
kind
of
a
fictitious
argument.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
a
matter
before
in
which
confusion
was
alleged.
and
in
my
brief
and
oral
argument,
i
enlarged
upon
it,
so
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
very
appropriately
said,
"and
if
the
board
thinks
that
there
was
no
contention
in
the
matter,
look
what
the
court
says."
and
i
quote,
page
91
of
the
transcript.
one
of
the
respondents'
contentions
before
the
board
was
that
the
election
should
be
set
aside
because
of
the
notices.
affidavits
filed
by
respondent
established
that
this
discrepancy
and
irregularity
was
brought
to
the
attention
to
the
board's
representative
that
a
conference
held
for
the
purpose
of
arranging
details
for
the
election.
the
board's
investigation
disclosed
merely
that
its
representative
did
not
recall
respondent
having
objective
to
the
irregularity
in
the
name.
and
it
goes
on
and
drops
down
about
half
a
page.
but
the
board
and
the
regional
director,
in
disclosing
of
the
respondent's
objection,
merely
assumed
that
no
confusion
or
prejudice
resulted
and
the
court
draws
its
conclusion.
but
in
view
of
the
closeness
of
the
election
and
the
confusion
as
to
whether
two
employees
were
actually
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
vote,
we
are
not
satisfied
that
the
board's
disposition
of
the
objection
was
such
that
it
is
entitled
to
obtain
enforcement
of
the
order.
the
board
had
shown
no
deference
at
all
to
the
respondent
or
the
employer
in
the
case.
they
were
denying
everything
by
administrative
procedures.
the
question
is
should
we,
under
these
circumstances,
give
the
stamp
of
approval
to
the
board's
rejection
when
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
such
a
conclusion,
whether
the
irregularity
had
any
effect
on
the
election
was
never
ascertained.
we
hold
that
the
ends
of
justice
require
a
new
election.
thank
you
for
your
indulgence.
