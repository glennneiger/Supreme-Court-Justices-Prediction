mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
--
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
denied
enforcement
of
a
national
labor
relations
board
order
requiring
the
respondent,
mattison
machine
works
to
bargain
with
the
united
auto
workers
on
the
ground
that
the
underlying
representation
election
was
effective.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
exceeded
its
reviewing
power
under
section
10
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
concluding
that
some
of
the
employees
may
have
been
dissuaded
from
voting
in
the
election
because
the
election
notices
and
the
ballots
described
the
employer
as
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company
instead
of
mattison
machine
works
or
the
board
had
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
or
indeed
a
contention
that
this
error
in
nomenclature
confused
either
the
employer
or
the
employees.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
company
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
manufacturing
company
instead
of
works.
mattison
machine
was
the
same
in
both
(inaudible).
the
effects
are
briefly
these.
respondent
is
a
machine
tool
manufacturing
company
in
rockwood,
illinois.
in
1957,
the
auto
workers
filed
a
petition
under
section
9
(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
the
board's
regional
director
in
chicago
requesting
an
election
to
determine
whether
respondent's
production
and
maintenance
employees
desire
the
union
as
their
representative.
the
petition,
although
giving
the
correct
address
of
the
employer,
described
it
as
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company.
the
petition
went
to
hearing
before
a
hearing
officer
but
the
only
issue
was
raised
by
the
respondent
or
whether
the
union
was
in
compliance
with
the
acts'
filing
requirements,
sections
9
(f),
(k)
and
(h)
whether
the
petition
was
in
fact
back
by
its
30%
of
the
employees.
respondent
made
no
contention
that
there
was
any
error
in
the
name
of
the
company
and
made
no
motion
to
correct
the
name
set
forth
on
the
petition.
based
on
this
hearing,
the
board
thereafter
directed
that
an
election
be
conducted
on
the
union's
petition.
the
election
was
held
in
respondent's
plant
pursuant
to
customary
board
procedure
and
there
is
no
contention
that
that
was
not
followed
here,
notices
of
the
election
were
posted
for
at
least
three
working
days
before
the
election
that
each
location
of
the
plant
where
notices
to
employees
were
customarily
posted,
describing
the
voting
unit,
the
date
of
the
election
and
where
in
the
plant
and
the
hours
at
where
--
at
which
the
election
would
be
held.
however,
the
notices
and
the
ballots
that
were
subsequently
used,
continued
to
describe
the
employer
as
manufacturing
company
instead
of
works.
but
in
each
case,
mattison
machine
was
spelled
out
both
in
the
notices
and
on
the
ballots.
in
the
election,
317
out
of
342
eligible
voters
or
about
92%
of
the
potential
electorate
voters,
157
votes
were
cast
for
the
union,
141
votes
against,
1
ballot
was
void
and
18
were
challenged.
challenged
ballots
being
defirmitive
of
the
election
results
original
director
undertook
to
investigate
the
challenges.
the
respondent
filed
with
the
regional
director,
objections
to
the
conduct
of
the
election
and
objections
to
the
regions'
investigation
of
the
challenges.
in
essence,
the
contention
was
that
one
field
examiner
had
not
adequately
investigated
the
18
challenges
and
that
another
one
had
improperly
denied
two
employees
the
right
to
vote
in
the
ground
that
they
were
supervisors.
two
weeks
later,
respondent
sent
the
regional
director
a
letter
stating,
and
this
is
quoted
at
page
19
of
the
record,
another
error
in
this
case
that
you
should
know
about
is
the
fact
that
your
specimen
ballot
and
notice
of
election
and
the
tally
ballot,
they
were
furnished,
all
speak
of
the
company
as
the
mattison
machine
manufacturing
company
instead
of
the
mattison
machine
works.
the
regional
director
investigated
the
objections
and
issued
a
report
on
objections
and
challenges.
he
found
no
merit
to
the
objections
respecting
the
misnomer
in
name.
he
found
that
it
was
a
--
such
a
limited
extent
that
it
could
not
have
tended
to
confuse
the
employees.
respecting
the
challenges,
he
recommended
that
8
would
be
sustained
and
the
remaining
10
be
overruled.
and
since
the
remaining
challenges
were
not
enough
to
now
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election.
he
recommended
that
the
union
be
certified.
respondent
filed
exceptions
to
the
regional
director's
report
with
the
board
--
respecting
the
misnomer
on
the
notices
and
on
the
ballots.
there
was
no
contention
that
the
employees
were
misled
thereby
or
nor
was
any
effort
made
to
show
that.
respondents'
position
was
simply
that
since
the
ballots
or
the
documents
by
which
the
employees
authorized
the
union
to
represent
them,
a
technical
defect
in
the
ballots
ipso
facto
rendered
the
authorization
legally
in
effect.
the
respondent
added
that
it
--
it
brought
the
defect
to
the
attention
of
a
field
examiner
of
the
board
in
the
preliminary
conferences
that
had
been
held
prior
to
the
election
but
the
field
examiner
had
done
nothing
about
changing
the
name.
it
was
a
--
i
reiterate,
no
contention,
nor
no
effort
to
prove
that
the
defect
in
name
had
any
effect
on
the
--
in
terms
of
confusing
the
employees.
the
contention
was
simply
that
since
there
was
this
defect,
the
vote
couldn't
validly
authorize
the
union.
in
effect,
the
argument
similar
to
the
argument
that
if
somebody
undertakes
to
convey
black
acre
by
deed
if
he
describes
the
property
as
a
white
acre,
the
deed
is
ineffective
to
affect
the
conveyance,
that
was
the
nature
of
the
contention
that
respondent
raised
with
respect
to
the
variance
in
--
in
name.
the
board
found
that
respondents'
exceptions
were
without
merit.
with
respect
to
the
misnomer,
the
board
held
that
in
view
of
the
slight
nature
of
the
discrepancy.
a
fact
that
the
election
was
held
in
the
plant
and
that
317
out
of
342
of
the
employees
had
voted,
it
could
not
reasonably
be
said
that
the
employees
could
have
been
misled
by
this
slight
variance.
the
board
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
the
board
further
noted
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
any
employees
were
misled
by
the
variance
nor
did
the
employer
so
contend.
the
board
then
went
on
to
sustain
the
regional
director's
rulings
with
respect
to
six
of
the
challenged
ballots,
he
had
sustained
the
challenges
to
eight.
the
board
found
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
sustain
six
because
even
assuming
that
the
remaining
12
challenges
and
the
votes
of
the
two
employees
who
are
allegedly
denied
an
opportunity
to
vote
on
the
ground
that
they
were
supervisors.
even
if
he
accounted
all
of
those
against
the
union,
the
union
would
still
have
a
majority,
the
final
tally
being
157
for
the
union
and
a
155
against
the
union.
so
the
board
certified
the
union.
respondent
petitioned
for
a
reconsideration
of
the
board's
decision
and
did
not
even
mention
the
ruling
on
the
misnomer
as
one
of
the
grounds
for
reconsideration.
it
limited
it
--
its
contention
to
the
fact
that
these
two
alleged
supervisory
employees,
were
improperly
denied
the
right
to
cast
a
ballot
and
that
the
six
challenges
should
not
have
been
sustained.
thereafter,
the
--
the
board
found
that
the
petition
had
not
--
reconsideration,
didn't
present
anything
that
hadn't
been
considered
previously
and
denied
it
and
certified
the
union.
the
respondent
refused
the
bargain
with
the
union
asserting
the
invalidity
of
the
underlying
representation
election,
unfair
labor
practice
charges
were
filed
by
the
union
and
the
board
issued
an
order
requiring
the
company
that
they
--
to
bargain
with
the
union.
the
board
then
undertook
to
obtain
enforcement
of
that
order
in
the
court
below
and
under
9
(d)
of
the
act,
that
brought
up
for
review
the
validity
of
the
underlying
representation
procedure
because
that
was
the
sole
basis
for
the
refusal
of
the
bargain.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
respondent
asserted
that
the
four
erred
in
certifying
the
union
as
the
bargaining
representative
without
first
taking
evidence
on
whether
the
misnomer
kept
some
employees
from
voting
and
on
the
question
of
whether
these
two
employees
alleged
to
be
supervisors
were
denied
an
opportunity
to
vote.
if
they
were
supervisors,
of
course
they
would
not
have
been
in
the
bargaining
unit.
now,
this
was
the
first
time
in
this
proceeding
that
the
respondent
equated
the
misnomer
with
confusion
of
employees.
up
to
now,
it
had
merely
been
asserting
that
a
technical
variance
was
--
was
enough
irrespective
that
it
may
not
have
had
any
effect
on
the
employees.
the
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
board
to
hold
a
new
election.
it
conceded
that
the
respondent
had
made
no
showing
that
the
misnomer
had
caused
confusion
and
that
it
may
well
be
that
no
confusion
in
fact
resulted.
and
i'm
now
reading
from
the
court's
opinion
at
record
page
92,
"but
in
view
of
the
closeness
of
the
election
and
the
confusion
as
to
whether
two
employees
were
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
vote,
was
incumbent
upon
the
board
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
of
the
25
employees
who
did
not
vote
might
have
failed
to
do
so
because
of
the
irregularity
in
the
notices
of
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
seems
to
be
the
proposition,
your
honor
and
it
does
not
stand
alone
in
this
case
because
the
seventh
circuit
has
reiterated
this
proposition
in
two
other
cases
besides
this
case,
one
of
which
is
pending
on
a
petition
for
certiorari,
number
382,
the
celanese
case.
now,
we
believe
that
--
that
proposition
is
--
is
contrary
to
settled
principles
enunciated
by
this
court
and
followed
by
the
other
courts
of
appeals,
namely
that
section
9
of
the
act
vest
the
board
with
discretion
to
determine
when
an
election
reflects
the
fair
and
free
choice
of
the
employees
and
the
role
of
the
reviewing
court
is
to
step
in
only
if
the
board
is
arbitrary
and
capricious.
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
to
the
board's
conclusion.
furthermore,
a
corollary
to
that
principle
is
that
the
burden
is
not
on
the
board
but
on
the
party
challenging
the
fairness
of
the
election
to
reduce
evidence
in
support
of
his
contentions.
now,
the
reasons
for
these
principles
are
two-fold.
in
the
thousands
of
elections
which
the
board
conducts
each
year
and
it
conducted
over
6000
fiscal
year
ending
1960
it
is
acquired
to
some
degree
of
expertise
in
spotting
what
kinds
of
irregularities
are
aft
to
affect
employee
free
choice.
i
think
if
the
board
can
late
claim
to
expertise
in
any
field
that
is
in
this
election
field
here.
to
require
the
board
to
investigate
every
unsupported
charge
of
election
irregularity,
would
tend
the
board
down
the
election
machinery
in
an
endless
delay,
thereby
nullifying
the
statutes'
basic
aim
which
is
at
--
get
a
prompt
determination
of
the
employees
desires
concerning
a
representative
in
the
hope
that
this
will
be
the
best
way
of
avoiding
industrial
strike.
now,
in
the
circumstances
here,
we
submit
that
the
board
was
--
was
clearly
reasonable
in
concluding
that
the
slight
misnomer
in
--
in
company
name
was
not
likely
to
have
deterred
any
employees
voting,
nor
that
the
respondent
here
introduced
any
contrary
evidence
before
the
board.
indeed
as
i
pointed
out,
it
did
not
even
contend
before
the
board
that
this
defect
had
any
effect
so
far
as
confusing
the
employees.
the
confusion
contention
was
first
advanced
in
its
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
statement
there
set
forth
which
is
also
repeated
at
page
10
of
its
brief
in
this
court
for
the
effect
that
when
the
election
notices
were
posted,
it
scared
many
employees
who
arranged
their
vacations
to
include
the
day
of
the
election
as
no
record
support
whatever.
there's
not
anything
in
the
record
that
would
substantiate
that
speculation
which
respondent
indulged
in
first
in
its
brief
in
the
court
below
and
repeated
in
its
brief
to
this
court.
finally,
we
submit
that
the
alleged
confusion
over
the
two
employees
who
did
not
vote
mentioned
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
misnomer.
the
confusion
with
respect
to
them
was
simply
whether
or
not
when
they
came
up
to
get
a
ballot.
the
field
examiner,
the
board
filed
examiner
told
them
that
since
they
had
been
struck
from
the
eligibility
list
by
the
employer
that
they
could
cast
a
ballot
but
it
would
be
challenged
or
whether
as
alleged
by
the
employer,
they
were
merely
told
that
they
couldn't
vote.
now,
the
board
did
not
resolve
that
conflict
in
testimony
because
it
found
it
unnecessary
to
do
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
even
had
they
voted
and
had
they
voted
against
the
union,
the
union
still
would
have
had
a
majority.
there
is
no
showing,
no
indication,
no
contention
that
this
colloquy
between
the
observers
and
the
--
and
the
two
alleged
supervisors
was
noticed
by
any
of
the
employees,
had
any
effect,
any
confusion
on
the
employees.
it
is
merely
a
confusion
with
respect
to
an
evidentiary
conflict
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
misnomer
but
so
--
so
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
--
that
the
court
clearly
erred
in
this
case.
as
i
--
as
i
indicated
before
however,
we
are
not
solely
concerned
about
this
case,
we're
concerned
about
the
fact
that
it
is
or
appears
to
be
part
of
a
pattern
here
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
celanese
case
which
is
pending
on
--
on
cert,
involve
a
little
different
factual
pattern
but
essentially
the
same
erroneous
standard.
there,
the
board
and
i
don't
want
to
burden
the
court
too
much
with
the
facts
of
celanese,
set
aside
an
election
because
it
found
that
--
that
there
had
been
a
--
a
misstatement
on
the
union's
part
in
the
closing
moments
of
the
campaign.
the
union
--
the
company
had
alleged
that
--
the
union
had
asserted
that
all
of
the
fringed
benefits
enjoyed
by
the
employees
with
a
result
of
collective
bargaining
when
in
fact
it
turned
out
that
one
or
two
had
not
been
the
result
of
collective
bargaining
but
had
given
voluntarily
by
the
company.
the
board
found
that
the
employees
could
be
relied
upon
to
adequately
evaluate
the
misstatement.
the
court
below,
following
the
principle
that
it
had
enunciated
in
the
earlier
(inaudible)
case,
took
the
position
that
since
there
was
a
misstatement
of
fact
in
the
closing
moments
of
the
campaign,
that
was
enough
to
set
the
election
aside
that
board
elections
had
to
--
had
to
be
pure.
the
truth
had
to
be
pure
and
that
if
there
was
any
dilution
of
the
truth,
that
was
enough
to
render
the
election
vulnerable.
we
submit,
that
there
again,
the
court
has
misconceived
the
issue
and
misapplied
the
correct
standard.
the
question
is
not
whether
there
were
misstatements
in
the
election,
whether
there
were
misnomers
in
the
names
of
the
--
of
the
parties
but
whether
the
employees
could
reasonably
evaluate
the
misstatement
or
were
misled
by
the
misnomer.
and
a
further
question
is
whether
the
board
was
reasonable
in
concluding
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
that
the
employees
were
not
misled
or
could
reasonably
evaluate
the
misstatement
and
if
the
burden
is
on
the
party
seeking
to
invalidate
the
election
to
come
forward
with
the
evidence
to
rebut
the
board's
reasonable
conclusion.
therefore,
we
submit,
your
honors
that
this
case
should
be
reversed
remanded
with
directions
