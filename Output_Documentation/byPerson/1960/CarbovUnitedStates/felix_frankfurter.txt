justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
to
infer
that
you
think
this
change
could
be
made
by
rule
of
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
possible
stand
from
new
york
to
california
to
be
served
by
local
marshals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
starting
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
look,
i
have
the
chart
now
in
front
of
me.
just
give
the
illustration
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
could
you
irrelevantly
add
that
to
bring
the
defendant
and
on
the
restraint
by
state
authority
to
which
the
state
authorities
are
making
all
objections
to
trial
in
california
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
irrelevant
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
separate
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
started
out
together
but
it
became
a
separate
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
saying.
that's
a
different
section.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
answered
justice
stewart
that
the
limitation
within
their
respective
jurisdiction
didn't
come
into
the
legislation
until
67.
it
is
fair
to
add
that
from
the
very
beginning,
there
was
an
implication
that
district
courts
act
territorially.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
adding
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
say
the
interest
that
to
give
--
to
give
district
court
power
to
execute
--
give
district
court
jurisdiction
through
the
narrow,
technical
sentence
empowered
through
action,
the
legal
power
to
action
was
accepted
in
very,
very
few
instances
in
1789
restricted
to
the
geography
within
which
the
case
arose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
67
nearly
spoke
out
what
was
inherent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
decided,
that's
another
case
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
labor
board
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
going
on
your
live
suggestion
that
when
ought
not
to
overstate
the
argument,
i
suggested
when
you
suggested
that
despite
of
giving
a
different
meaning
and
that
as
applies
to
one,
two,
three,
four,
the
statute
would
be
emasculated,
you
needless,
you
are
using
a
needless
exception
of
phrase?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
for
this
reason
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
one,
two,
three,
four,
that
functionally
one,
two,
three,
four
are
different
from
what
5
is
functionally.
they
are
all
make
inquiries
into
restrain
and
therefore
you're
almost
in
the
nature
of
reason
that
the
inquiry
must
be
made
by
the
judge
within
the
territory
where
the
fellow
is
incarcerated.
five
is
a
totally
different
thing.
i'm
not
saying
the
result
is
different.
i'm
saying
the
function
of
the
first
four
and
it's
a
common
function
and
five
is
not
that
function
but
a
different
function.
that
while
it
would
be
almost
senseless
or
--
or
have
all
sorts
of
inherent
objections
to
say
that
the
judge
in
california
shall
find
out
why
a
man
is
detained
in
new
york
while
a
judge
in
massachusetts
inquire
of
allegedly
unlawful
detention
in
georgia,
it
doesn't
make
such
none
sense
to
say
that
were
a
trial
is
being
held
--
the
territory
within
which
a
trial
is
held
shall
have
power
to
get
people
of
that
court,
somebody
who
is
testified
and
still
more
somebody
who
is
the
defendant
in
the
case.
so
for
a
judge
it
would
be
no
emasculation
to
make
differentiation
illegal
results
from
a
differentiation
and
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
simply
delighted
by
attitude
of
restrain,
that's
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
of
course
we
address
to
that.
i
merely
suggest
in
view
of
the
arguments
which
you
listed
this
morning
that
this
court
sometimes
can
fail
to
draw
sunshine
out
of
congressional
cloud.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
problem
wasn't
before
it
in
67.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
me,
there
are
no
clouds
in
67
because
in
67,
the
habeas
corpus
provision
dealt
entirely
with
inquiry
into
unlawfully
intention
and
naturally
you
want
a
local
man
to
inquire
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
didn't
have
the
1948
edition,
namely,
for
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
beside,
we
never
--
that
question
was
never
passed
on
certainly
by
this
court
whether
the
ad
testificandum
was
also
restricted
locally.
have
we
passed
down
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
so
you're
just
arguing
from
the
statutory
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
is
just
as
–
is
just
as
easily
arguable
there
if
a
phrase
has
--
if
the
use
to
which
a
writ
is
to
be
put
as
different
function,
the
same
phrase
maybe
distributively
used
to
fit
the
difference
in
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
that
happens
--
that's
my
conclusion
but
i'm
putting
you
to
difficulties
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
spelling
out
where
we
have
no
weighting,
indeed
no
so
far
as
i
know
no
legislative
materials
in
the
incision
of
the
addition
of
court
trial
in
1948
and
the
revised
notes
are
as
often
the
revised
notes
are
blind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
wirin,
if
i
was
still
a
professor
interested
in
the
correct
administration
of
federal
jurisdiction
could
i
make
a
representation
to
this
court
that
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
overruled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
had
no
standing
that
he
is
an
outsider.
justice
felix
frankfurter
should
we
add
that
it's
too
difficult
for
us
to
decide
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
this
part
of
whether
we
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
in
--
not
in
the
formulated
expression
which
he
gave
--
it
gave
to
its
policy,
but
not
and
what
it
admitted
as
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
asserting
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
to
decide
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wirin,
well
i
--
i
put
this
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
where
to
offer
--
was
to
offer
considerations
of
policy
in
the
effectuation
of
2255
fundamentally,
that
was
your
answer,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
in
order
to
effectuate
that,
you
had
to
have
these
implied
powers
not
only
as
to
bring
the
defendant,
an
incarcerated
person
to
district
--
distant
place
but
also
witnesses.
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
and
that
i
have
suggested
to
you
is
that
the
addition
of
four
trials
we
know
nothing
about
it.
as
far
as
i
know
nobody
said
a
word
about
it.
have
you
found
anything
in
the
legislative,
so-called
legislative
history
of
the
revises
to
come,
did
you
find
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
none.
so
that
when
we
find
this
new
addition
of
power,
now
look
at
the
policy
behind
that.
in
a
country
like
ours
which
is
interplay
between
states
and
federal
--
criminal
prosecutions
that
it
certainly
reasonably
arguable
that
they
didn't
mean
this
to
be
operative
only
within
the
confines
of
a
single
state
as
to
the
ponzi
case,
that
the
kind
of
state
federal
criminal
prosecutions
relationship
is
arguably
in
order
to
effectuate
to
get
a
fellow
before
a
trial
from
a
distant
place,
the
distant
place
doesn't
have
to
be
confined
within
the
same
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
the
last
person
in
the
world
who
wants
to
take
over
the
congress'
charge,
but
when
congress
gives
me
a
phrase
about
which
it
says
nothing
and
the
effectuation
of
which
inquired
a
consideration
of
the
context
in
which
it
finds
itself
then
i
have
--
then
i
have
an
ambiguous
statute
and
i
don't
have
to
exercise
lenity.
i
think
we
have
to
exercise
rationality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that
this
is
very
unlikely
--
habeas
corpus
is
a
very
deceptive
phrase
with
reference
to
this
exercise
of
judicial
authority.
i
understand
what
habeas
corpus
normally
when
we
say
habeas
corpus
we
mean,
let's
find
out
why
a
fellow
is
in
jail,
not
to
get
into
one
place
to
another
nor
to
stand
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
these
interim
ad
hoc
statutes
allowed
the
writ
to
run
outside
the
territory
of
the
district
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
they
are
all
restricted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
completeness
sake,
perhaps
this
word
is
a
little
something
to
add
but
as
to
--
out
of
--
out
of
--
as
to
out
of
state
accused
anybody
who
was
indicted
in
the
state
and
in
outside
of
the
state
of
his
indictment
he
can
be
brought
to
the
indicting
state
by
virtue
of
the
state
revision.
the
fellow
was
free
i
mean.
the
man
is
indicted
in
california,
if
this
man
had
been
free
walking
the
streets
of
new
york,
california
could
have
got
him
back
by
state
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
find
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
he
left
california
appearing
and
pleading
and
then
he
was
allowed
on
bail,
that
must
have
been
some
piece
which
must
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
he
did
get
to
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
he
got
to
california
at
sometime
to
plea,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
physically
he
was
present
in
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
was
the
legal
document
by
which
he
was
allowed
to
leave
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
just
allowed
him
to
go
free.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know
california
today
is
a
very
hospitable
place
but
they
didn't
say
that,
“it's
all
right
you're
now
goodbye
you
can
go
to
ahead
and
do
what
you
please,”
what
happened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
couldn't
--
the
marshal
wouldn't
do
that
on
his
own,
he
had
to
have
some
judicial
autho
--
authorization
for
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
--
the
purpose
of
my
inquiry
is
to
see
if
you
haven't
still
got
hold
of
him
as
it
were
in
california
and
merely
allowed
him
to
grass
out
of
new
york
in
the
mean
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
he
at
large
in
new
york
in
search
of
–
it's
awfully
difficult
thing
in
new
york
to
find
a
lawyer,
how
long
did
it
take
him
before
he
got
into
the
courts
of
the
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
new
york
in
order
to
get
a
new
york
lawyer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
jail
--
the
jail
sentence
preceded
this
federal
activity,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
but
you
give
me
the
relation
between
getting
into
new
york
jail
and
going
out
to
california
in
physical
person
to
plea
and
then
being
allowed
at
large
in
california
by
this
gentleman
the
way
that
they
have
out
there.
well
i
thought
they
allowed
him
to
go
from
even
--
he
was
in
california
in
the
presence
of
the
court,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
was
allowed
to
go
back
to
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
very
well
he
was
taken.
what
i
am
saying
-
what
i
have
in
my
head
is
if
the
california,
if
the
u.s.
attorney
the
u.s.
authorities
in
california
had
wanted
to
do
and
the
judge
had
agreed
to
it,
he
would
have
been
kept
in
california
and
go
into
trial
there,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
was
allowed
in
that
sense
by
the
federal
authorities
to
go
back
to
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
serve
out
a
sentence
for
which
he'd
been
previously
tried
in
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
new
york
is
been
his
almost
hospitable
as
new
yorkers,
he
was
--
plead
guilty,
he
was
charged
of
the
crime
in
new
york,
he
plead
guilty,
he
was
out
on
bail,
and
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
california
to
plead
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
have
been
in
--
he
could
have
been
in
jail
when
he
went
out
to
california
to
plea,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
he
was
in
california
he
could
have
been
at
the
same
time
in
jail
in
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
i'm
pointing
is
that
he
appeared
before
the
federal
authorities
in
california,
he
was
allowed
at
large
physically
speaking
although
they
could
have
retained
him.
he
was
allowed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
think
that's
large.
he
was
allowed
so
far
as
california
was
concerned
to
leave
that
state,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
but
he
was
allowed
as
my
brother
douglas
indicates
at
the
exhibit
3,
he
was
on
leash
when
he
left
california,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
when
he
got
back
to
new
york
which
i
understood
was
to
get
a
good
new
york
lawyer
or
a
bad
new
york
lawyer
i
don't
know
which,
he
was
then
put
in
jail
again
by
the
new
york
authority,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
problem
isn't
what
it's
for
but
whether
the
court
has
power
to
issue
it
and
why
don't
you
direct
us
to
page
15
which
is
the
writ
that
was
issued
in
this
case
which
we
have
to
sustain
if
we
are
going
to
sustain
it.
and
as
you
answered
justice
whittaker
a
little
while
ago,
the
writ
makes
the
answer
to
his
question
wherefore
your
petition
raise
for
an
order
directing
the
issue
in
some
writ
of
habeas
corpus
directed
to
said
warden,
sheriff
or
jailer.
the
object
of
the
writ
is
not
this
person
who
was
complaining
about
it
but
the
jailer
and
you
still
have
to
consider,
you
still
have
to
deal
with
the
question
whether
the
southern
district
or
california
central
division
has
power
to
issue
a
writ
to
anybody
outside
of
the
southern
district
of
california.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
has
standing
to
raise
it,
but
the
writ
was
issued
not
to
carbo
but
to
whoever
the
gentleman
was
or
the
jailer
in
new
york
and
therefore
the
question
is,
may
that
court
issue
this
writ
directed
to
the
jailer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
to
the
prisoner,
the
habeas
corpus
provision
2241
talks
about
the
writ
habeas
corpus
shall
not
extend
to
a
prisoner.
now
this
isn't
extended
to
a
prisoner,
it
was
extended
to
the
jailer
and
he
is
swept
in
under
the
power
if
there'd
be
power
and
there
certainly
is
power
within
the
jurisdiction
within
the
territory
of
jurisdiction
to
direct
a
writ
to
a
jailer
to
produce
somebody
who
is
incarcerated
and
has
no
choice
in
the
matter
whether
he
will
come
or
not
unless
--
unless
he
has
some
standing
to
object
to
what
the
jailer
has
been
ordered
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
not
also,
is
there
any
writ
with
which
we
are
concern
and
the
validity
of
which
is
challenged
that
was
addressed
to
paul
john
carbo.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
this
writ
address
to
the
jailer
is
not
in
terms
on
the
--
is
not
in
terms
of
28-2241
(b)
or
(c)
because
it
does
not
extend
to
a
prisoner.
it
is
under
28
u.s.c.
2241
(5)
--
(1)
and
(5)
and
it
isn't
extended
to
a
prisoner.
congress
has
put
together
in
this
section
four
situations
for
issuing
the
conventional
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
inquire
into
a
restraint
of
living.
and
it
has
thrown
into
that
same
section
quite
illogically
and
quite
unintelligently,
i
think,
sections
5
which
has
a
--
it
has
a
filthy
different
purpose
addressed
to
a
different
officials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
letter
that
you
envision
would
be
a
letter
say
from
the
united
states
attorney,
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
or
to
the
keeper
of
urban
jail
or
fixing
saying
you
got
a
fellow
in
there
named
carbo
and
his
trial
is
set
two
weeks
from
now,
would
you,
under
appropriate
charge
and
amount,
he
is
going
to
trial
and
say
that's
pertinent
--
carbo
couldn't
bring
a
habeas
corpus
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
against
removal
from
singsing
to
california?
that's
your
–
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
thought
about
it?
if
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
talking
about,
instead
of
doing
what
was
done
here.
a
trial
is
set
for
carbo
two
weeks
after
and
the
united
states
attorney
says
carbo
isn't
here
and
is
--
is
not
in
jail.
if
you
do
nothing
about
it,
he
will
remain
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
writes
to
the
attorney
general
in
washington
and
states
the
situation
and
the
attorney
general
of
washington
writes
to
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
and
those
two
respective
authorities
for
their
respective
governments
come
to
an
agreement
with
the
attorney
general
or
whoever
has
authority
over
the
jailer
in
singsing
direct
takes
measures
to
take
him
under
appropriate
guard
to
california.
if
you
were
--
i'm
asking
you,
could
carbo
then
sue
out
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
against
being
removed
from
singsing
with
the
authority
of
--
the
state
authority
for
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
the
ideas
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
forget
in
--
i
forget
in
ponzi,
was
that
all
of
the
arrangement
between
the
officials,
between
the
federal
officials
and
the
massachusetts
state
officials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
dissenting,
the
other
way
around
could
happen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
looked
at
the
government's
brief
in
ponzi
that
you
referred
to
the
--
that
you
said
certain
assumptions,
prevailed
after
that
time.
the
government
filed
a
short
brief
as
amicus
in
which
it
said,
"it's
none
of
ponzi's
business,
it's
our
business
to
object
to
this
thing
and
ponzi
has
got
no
say."
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
took
it
as
a
matter
of
lying
entirely
within
the
control
of
state
federal
officials
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
to
cut
into
your
argument
by
that
--
that
version.
the
question
i
raised
is
whether
this
--
whether
what
the
--
sought
to
be
done
here
could
be
worked
out
through
official
channels
and
if
so,
this
case
assumes
a
relatively
minor
importance
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
of
course,
i
--
i
lay
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
i
may
find
it
as
difficult
to
decide
the
question
where
they
could
be
worked
as
between
official
is
to
decide
this
case.
but
i
wouldn't
have
to
go
through
the
maze
of
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
do
have
to
go
through
it
because
the
power
is
asserted
on
the
legislation.
this
was
a
court
order
issued
under
section
22
--
what
is
it,
41.
and
therefore,
since
that
is
the
claim,
if
that
is
the
exertion
of
judicial
power,
it
would
seem
almost
clear
that
one
has
to
consider
whether
that
is
a
valid
dictation
of
judicial
power
unless
one
says
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
he
has
no
standing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
statute
says
(inaudible)
at
this
as
you
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
this
case.
this
is
not
a
warrant,
this
is
not
a
subpoena,
this
is
not
a
corporation.
this
is
an
exertion
of
power
under
2241
3
(5)
--
(c)
(5)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
beirne
i
want
to
be
sure
a
writ
is
addressed
to
the
fellow
who
is
a
man
in
custody
that
the
ordinary
writ
of
habeas
corpus
held
him
to
produce
the
man
because
he's
unlawfully
in
custody
and
it
doesn't
end
up
when
the
--
at
determination
of
the
proceeding
to
return
into
the
custody,
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
what
the
terms
of
the
writ
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
ordinary
habeas
corpus
doesn't
have
any
such
provision.
the
ordinary
habeas
corpus
says,
"you
produce
a
fellow
who
claims
that
he's
unlawfully
jailed
and
he
wants
to
get
out
then
stay
out,"
not
you
who
are
the
custodian
of
the
prisoner
under
the
new
york
law
will
you
produce
him
because
the
southern
state
of
california
wants
to
deal
with
him
and
when
it
is
through,
he
will
return
to
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
whole
function
and
terms
of
the
writ,
everything
about
it
is
different
from
the
first
four
categories
of
2241.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
answer
the
jurisdiction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
it
doesn't
answer
it
but
--
but
it's
given
us
a
different
basis
for
considering
what
the
answer
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
the
revises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
saying
that's
why
the
case
is
here
and
that's
why
you've
argued
on
both
sides
a
difficult
problem.
the
question
is
whether
a
phrase
of
general
applicability
in
a
specific
statute
which
relating
to
two
totally
resides
the
different
situation
must
necessarily
be
given
the
same
limitation.
that's
the
problem,
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
may
i
put
to
you
the
problem
i
put
to
mrs.
rosenberg.
cut
out
by
the
intervention
of
the
court,
but
if
in
this
situation,
the
attorney
general
or
the
united
states
attorney
in
los
angeles
had
written
to
his
chief
in
washington,
the
attorney
general
and
told
them
the
situation
and
asked
for
his
good
offices
to
seek
through
the
attorney
general
or
through
the
governor
of
new
york
the
guarded
release
of
--
what's
his
name
--
carbo
to
be
sent
out
to
los
angeles.
do
you
think
the
habeas
corpus
by
carbo
not
to
be
taken
by
the
jailer
to
los
angeles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why,
and
why?
why
couldn't
the
governor
of
new
york
having
in
the
prison
system
of
new
york
a
detainee
or
prisoner
accommodate
himself
to
the
--
what
he
regards
as
the
desirable
purpose
of
the
federal
government,
the
prosecutor
then
pursues
it
for
no
other
reason
and
that
the
charge
can
be
made
that
he
was
denied
on
--
he
was
denied
of
the
constitutional
protection
of
a
prompt
trial.
what
is
that?
what
provision
of
the
constitution
if
you
are
seeking
this
habeas
corpus
would
you
invoke?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
the
california
court.
i'm
not
--
court
is
out
of
it.
i'm
just
operating
between
two
officials,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
and
the
attorney
general
or
the
governor
of
new
york.
justice
felix
frankfurter
write
a
letter
to
the
governor
of
new
york?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
has
the
governor
of
new
york
--
what
limitation
says
the
federal
constitution
to
bar
the
governor
of
new
york
to
say,
"we
think
it's
highly
desirable
to
have
this
federal
prosecution
and
therefore
since
we
have
--
since
this
man
has
no
liberty,
he
must
been
in
singsing,
we'll
take
him
out
of
singsing
under
the
appropriate
guard"
and
let
the
federal
government
try
and
when
he's
through
then
he'll
be
returned
to
it.
what
constitutional
provision
bars
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
isn't
enlarged,
he
is
kept
in
the
new
york
custody.
