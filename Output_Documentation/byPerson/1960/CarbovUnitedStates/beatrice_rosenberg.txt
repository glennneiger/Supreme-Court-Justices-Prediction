ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
that
neither
one
of
these
situations
with
the
same
history
gives
rise
to
different
implications
and
so
before
i
get
into
the
main
part
of
my
argument,
let
me
see
if
i
can
see
what
we
think
the
history
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
with
this
discussion
which
frankly
i
do
not
think
it
turns
completely
on
the
history
of
the
statute
but
let's
see
if
we
can
clear
it
up.
originally,
in
the
judiciary
act
there
was
the
all
writs
statute
and
it
specifically
said
that
the
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
all
writs
including
with
the
habeas
corpus.
and
then
went
on
to
say
except
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
not
issue
to
the
prisoner
in
jail
unless
he
is
committed
under
the
authority
of
the
united
states
or
trial
by
the
united
states
or
if
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
testify.
so
to
that
extent
way
back
in
1789,
it
recognized
the
writ
ad
testificandum
with
no
particular
limitations.
now
right
after
that,
and
possibly
by
implications
before
but
certainly
by
1793,
congress
specifically
provided
as
an
amendment
to
that
first
judiciary
act
that
in
criminal
cases
subpoenas
which
run
throughout
the
united
states.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
question
got
that
all
for
writ
ad
testificandum
way
back
in
1793
because
a
writ
ad
testificandum
is
practically
and
legally
in
aid
of
subpoena
power,
that
is
--
it
is
the
means
by
which
you
get
a
jailor
to
whom
the
writ
ad
testificandum
is
addressed
to
enforce
the
subpoena
power,
the
subpoena
in
a
sense
same
directed
to
the
individual
whom
you
want
to
testify.
and
so,
the
rest
of
the
history
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
including
the
1867
statute
really
has
no
meaning
to
this
problem
because
there
were
successive
grants
of
powers
to
federal
courts
to
issue
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
subjiciendum.
first
because
of
the
first
act
in
1933
for
federal
officials
acting
under
color
of
federal
law
then
because
an
incident
involving
representative
of
british
power
in
order
a
writ
to
get
out
of
state
custody
people
who
acted
under
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
and
finally
in
1867
the
great
extension
of
power
which
this
court
spelled
in
aaron
against
clark,
the
one
that
gave
the
federal
court
power
to
inquire
into
the
reasons
why
at
state
is
holding
a
man
in
detention
even
under
a
state
conviction?
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
said
they
were
restricted
but
they
--
i
said
they
dealt
with
the
writ
ad
subjiciendum.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
their
function
and
they
didn't,
in
a
sense,
reached
this
question
at
all
but
in
my
view
the
question
of
the
writ
ad
testificandum
had
been
settled
back
in
the
79th
writ.
and
there
was
no
mention
that
the
writ
ad
prosequendum
specifically
referred
to
in
blackstone
mentioned
in
ex
parte
bollman,
but
there's
really
no
discussion
of
it.
i
think
this
is
my
guess
as
to
war.
until
ponzi
against
fessenden
which
was
decided
in
1922,
i
think
the
assumption
of
the
earlier
cases
is
that
if
a
man
was
in
prison
under
one
sovereignty,
the
other
sovereign
couldn't
try.
it
was
so
held
specifically
that
in
relation
to
where
they
just
started
issue
or
writ
ad
subjiciendum
to
a
state
prisoner
and
that
door
case
as
we
have,
but
it's
--
one
goes
through
the
cases
on
bail,
for
instance,
there's
a
case
of
taylor
against
(inaudible)
it's
cited
in
our
brief
in
another
connection
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
an
assumption
of
those
cases
and
truly
it
seems
to
have
been
the
practice
that
when
a
man
was
held
in
jail
by
the
state,
the
federal
government
didn't
try
him
and
vice
versa
and
the
fact
is
that
there
were
findings
of
that
the
power
to
do
this
in
1922
when
this
court
decided
in
ponzi
against
fessenden.
now
ponzi
against
fessenden
was
not
a
case
involving
territorial
consideration.
it
so
happened
that
the
federal
prisoner
from
the
state
of
massachusetts
(inaudible)
was
in
jail
in
massachusetts,
but
in
that
case
massachusetts'
issued
a
writ
ad
prosequendum
to
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
was
willing
to
turn
him
over
and
he
complained.
he
said,
“i
don't
want
to
be
moved
until
i
finished
here
my
federal
offense”
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
not
his
concern
that
even
though
he
was
going
to
be
moved
out
of
the
state
jail
and
into
the
federal
jail
for
trial
that
that
wasn't
a
matter
of
his
concern,
that
was
the
matter
of
comity
between
the
two
sovereigns
about
which
he
had
no
jurisdiction
to
complain.
and
the
fact
this
was
a
subject
to
that
came
up
to
this
court
indicates
to
me
that
it
certainly
was
not
a
general
practice
before
1922
became
more
general
thereafter.
and
i
assumed
this
is
wrong
when
the
revises
were
going
over
the
court
in
1948.
when
they
came
to
codifying
the
various
section
one
of
which
include
the
provision
that
it
should
not
issue
to
a
prisoner
in
jail
unless
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
be
brought
up
to
testify,
this
--
they've
decided
well
we
use
it
also
to
bring
him
up
for
trial
so
they
put
it
in
there.
now
as
i
say
there's
no
history
on
this,
but
this
is
what
seems
to
me
to
account
for
that
at
the
time
of
revision
by
1948
the
practice
of
exchanging
prisoners
back
and
forth
for
the
--
for
trial
was
much
more
common
since
it
had
been
recognized
in
ponzi
against
fessenden.
there
was
going
to
be
more
emphasis
on
the
necessity
of
speedy
trial
and
therefore
at
that
point
it
was
codified
into
practice.
now
let
me
point
out
that
when
this
did
get
into
the
revision
in
1948
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
had
already
come
into
existence
in
1946
and
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
made
it
clear
that
a
warrant
from
a
district
court
could
be
served
anywhere
in
the
united
states
so
that
by
1946,
it
seems
to
me,
it
was
already
recognized
both
as
to
the
subpoenas
and
as
to
warrants
that
in
criminal
cases
for
purposes
of
process,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
criminal
cases
was
nationwide
and
therefore
when
the
codifiers
in
1948
put
into
provision
that
the
writs
were
not
issued
to
a
prisoner
in
jail
unless
necessary
to
bring
him
up
to
testify
or
for
trial
it
seem
to
me
it
put
the
writs
ad
prosequendum
in
a
place
that
i
think
the
writ
ad
testificandum
went
from
1943
that
it
was
in
aid
of
federal
criminal
process
and
by
1948
federal
criminal
process
ran
throughout
the
united
states.
now
it
points
out
one
other
thing
that
was
in
existence
by
that
time.
in
page
1920
--
i
think
it
is
of
our
briefs,
we've
listed
the
first
two
of
what
are
number
of
cases
involving
corporate
summons.
before
the
rules
of
federal
procedure
made
any
provision
for
service
of
the
summons
on
the
corporation,
the
lower
court
had
held,
one,
that
you
could
get
a
corporation
into
court
for
a
summon
by
means
of
a
summon
although
the
summon
as
such
was
not
specifically
provided
for,
and
secondly,
that
that
summon
could
be
served
on
a
corporation
even
though
it
wasn't
doing
business
in
the
territorial
district
of
the
district
court
and
they
found
their
authorities
from
aside
that
it
was
perfectly
evident
from
some
of
the
statutes
like
the
sherman
act
and
the
icc
act
and
so
forth
that
congress
intended
corporations
to
be
tried.
and
they
--
therefore
it
was
necessary
for
corporations
to
be
tried
to
how
to
get
them
before
the
court
in
the
normal
way
of
getting
them
before
the
court
was
by
a
summon.
now
that
question
never
came
before
this
court.
this
court
referred
to
those
cases
in
passing.
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
as
if
it
was
definite
and
it's
true
the
(inaudible)
case
as
petitioner
argues
didn't
involve
the
question
of
jurisdiction
--
of
territorial
jurisdiction,
but
the
vast
is
that
the
authority
to
summon
a
corporation
and
to
summon
a
corporation
even
though
it
was
not
within
the
territorial
district
of
the
district
court
was
simply
accepted.
and
those
trends
of
another
point
by
this
court
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
it
was
never
questioned
at
the
time
the
rules
went
into
effect
in
1946.
and
so
again
this
is
just
one
other
illustration
of
the
fact
defined
in
1948,
i
think
it
could
be
taken
as
established
or
at
least
certainly
recognized
in
many
different
situations
subpoenas,
warrants,
corporate
summons
that
jurisdiction
of
criminal
court
for
the
purposes
of
process
and
was
not
territorially
confined.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
subpoena,
warrants
of
arrest,
and
the
corporate
summons
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
your
honor
the
1793.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
since
1793
that
had
always
been
the
position
now
embodied
in
rule
17.
in
criminal
case
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
limited
to
criminal
case.
yes,
a
100
mile
outside
the
district
in
civil
cases
except
where
--
except
then
where
there
are
certain
special
provisions
such
as
the
sherman
act,
but
since
--
explicit
since
1793
in
criminal
cases.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
california
could
have
got
him
back
by
state
extradition.
if
in
the
federal
court
that
brings
me
to
what
i
would
come
into
in
this
case,
in
a
federal
court,
when
he
is
arrested
initially
under
rule
--
under
a
warrant
out
of
court
of
california
he
does
have
a
right
to
what
is
a
brief
called
the
removal
hearing
under
rule
40
at
which
point,
if
it's
on
a
complaint
that
may
show
probable
cause
but
it's
an
indictment.
it's
necessary
for
the
government
to
show
that
merely
to
produce
the
indictment
and
he
can
then
contest
identity.
the
court
issues
a
removal
order,
but
allowed
him
normally
to
post
bail.
now
that's
what
was
done
here.
it
so
happened
when
this
defendant
was
arrested
he
was
not
in
jail.
he
was
found
in
baltimore.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
in
baltimore,
maryland
and
he
was
accorded
a
rule
4
the
hearing.
now
most
of
the
time
people
don't
ask
for
hearing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
on
the
federal
--
on
the
california
federal
indictment.
he
was
arrested
in
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
district
court
of
california.
so,
this
was
a
situation
where
the
warrant
issued
after
indictment.
it
wasn't
a
complaint.
the
indictment
was
returned
the
warrant
to
arrest
issued.
he
was
picked
up
under
that
and
he
was
given
a
hearing
under
rule
40.
i
think
he
waived
hearing
eventually
but
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
at
that
point
bail
was
fixed.
as
a
matter
of
fact
bail
was
fixed
in
for
very
substantial
amount
of
$100,000.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
is
in
baltimore.
that's
--
that's
really
the
main
purpose
of
the
removal
hearing
in
present
proceedings
when
the
man
is
arrested
outside
the
district.
the
rules
provide
that
if
a
man
arrested
in
the
district
or
within
100
miles
from
the
district,
he's
to
be
brought
before
a
committing
magistrate
in
the
district
court.
and
there
he's
informed
of
his
right
to
cancel
and
his
right
to
post
bail
and
bail
is
fixed.
but
when
he's
arrested
after
the
district
had
tried,
the
rule
is
quite
fearing
to
(inaudible)
for
a
hearing
much
closer
to
home
because
in
the
normal
case
even
when
he
was
arrested
after
the
indictment
it
takes
a
while.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
only
issue
is
identity.
now
the
order
of
removal
is
issued
by
a
judge
and
i
presume
whenever
a
judge
acts
he
acts
judicially.
the
only
issue
presented
that
has
opened
his
identity
but
i
suppose
--
and
there
have
been
cases
where
it's
done
with
a
very
special
circumstance,
this
opposes
the
claim
in
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
i
post
--
if
somebody
came
and
said
he
was
awfully
ill
and
couldn't
do
that
a
court
could
--
if
he
couldn't
post
bail
and
say,
“well
i
will
withhold
my
order
for
a
week”,
i
suppose
we
have
to
agree
to
the
court
that
act
judicially
to
that
degree.
but
in
any
case
that
issue
isn't
here
because
this
man
did
have
a
rule
40
hearing
and
he
posted
a
$100,000
as
bail.
now,
in
the
normal
course
of
the
events
he
was
under
a
duty
to
come
to
the
court
of
california
without
any
further
process
of
any
kind
out
of
the
southern
district
of
california.
and
if
he
didn't
show
up,
he
would
have
forfeited
a
$100,000
bail
he
would
have
been
subject
to
be
rearrested
and
if
he
kept
on
long
enough,
he
would
even
be
subject
to
criminal
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
now
then
when
it
came
to
this
to
appear
the
usual
way
of
doing
this
in
this
situation
would
be
when
the
case
is
ready
they
think
it's
about
to
be
reached,
they
--
about
three
weeks
before
in
some
jurisdictions
sometimes
before
that.
in
this
case
it
was
december.
they
brought
him
back
to
plead
to
the
indictment.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
let
me
take
that
then.
in
the
normal
case
he
would
be
notified
to
plead
to
the
indictment.
when
it
came
time
for
this
man
to
be
arraigned
he
was
in
jail
in
new
york
and
so
what
they
did
at
this
point
was
issue
a
writ
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
to
the
taylor
in
new
york
which
new
york
honored
and
which
the
petitioner
did
not
then
contended.
he
came
out
to
california
under
this
writ
and
pleaded
not
guilty
and
at
this
point
he
asked
that
he
be
allowed
to
go
back
to
new
york,
bail
in
new
york
until
the
time
of
trial
because
he
wanted
to
arrange
to
get
a
lawyer
in
new
york.
and
this
was
done
with
the
understanding,
the
trail
date
was
fixed
with
due
march
30
and
then
on
march
16
this
man
--
they've
made
provision
for
the
writ
to
get
in
there
so
that
he
would
have
some
time
to
confer
with
counsel
before
trial.
that's
normal.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
second
writ
issued.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
we
could
--
the
state
of
new
york
wasn't
just
going
to
let
him
loose.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
arrested
in
baltimore
and
he
was
then
allowed
out
on
bail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
while
he
was
out
--
at
that
point
under
this
rule
40
hearing
you
don't
plead
to
the
indictment.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
under
a
writ
ad
prosequendum.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
court
discharged
a
writ
ad
prosequendum
at
this
point.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
the
state
of
new
york.
he
was
allowed
to
go
back
to
jail
in
new
york.
what
happen
is
when
he
was
--
when
he
was
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
when
he
was
--
he
came
to
california
under
a
writ
ad
prosequendum.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
in
the
custody
of
federal
marshalls.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
federal
marshall.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
now
i
think
--
i
think
i'm
not
positive
to
this
but
i
think
he
was
transported
back
by
a
federal
marshall.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
the
court
permitted
it.
i
don't
know
whether
it's
an
identified
formal
order
or
not
your
honor.
it
just
said
the
court
granted
his
request.
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
whether
they
formally
--
i
think
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
pardon.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
the
defendant
was
not
guilty.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
returned
to
new
york.
that's
right.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
no.
i
think
that
normally
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
i
must
admit
i
hadn't
thought
of
this.
the
court
didn't
think
so
either
apparently
because
it
did
issue
a
new
writ
ad
prosequendum
and
it
does
beg
a
question
i
take
it
a
federal
state
committee
to
that
degree
that
obviously
new
york
would
have
to
consent
to
this.
now
the
court
apparently
didn't
think
though,
because
it
did
issue
a
new
writ
ad
prosequendum
at
that
point
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
don't
know.
i
think
this
is
an
ordinary
course,
the
date
of
trail
was
fixed.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
the
district
attorney
applied
for
the
writ,
that's
in
the
record.
the
district
attorney
applied
for
the
writ
ad
prosequendum
and
then
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
then
--
pardon.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
then
his
attorneys
moved
to
quash
the
writ
on
the
grant
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
at
that
point
at
the
time
the
second
writ
was
issued.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
he
was
not
at
large
in
new
york.
he
was
brought
under
a
writ
ad
prosequendum
in
december.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
allowed
to
go
back
to
new
york
but
to
the
custody
of
the
new
york
he
went
back
to
prison
in
new
york.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
his
jail
sentence
came
in
between.
his
jail
sentence
in
new
york
came
while
he
was
out
on
bail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
it
was
for
a
crime
which
occurred
before
the
federal
crime.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
taken.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
normally
he
was
kept
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
to
serve
out
a
sentence
to
which
he
was
plead
guilty,
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
your
honor.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
indicted,
let
me
try
it
again.
but
he
was
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
he
was.
he
was
brought
to
california
under
a
writ.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
he
was
in
the
custody.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
was
not
allowed
at
large.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he's
allowed
to
leave
the
federal
district
court.
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
yes.
actually
except
that
--
as
i
understand
what
new
york
court
they
were
doing
is
new
york
thought
it
had
a
leash
on
him
overtime
too.
he
said
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
normally
your
honor
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
one
thing
is
i
don't
know
exactly
what
relationship
with
new
york
is,
normally,
when
you
arrange
with
the
state
authority
to
let
him
out
to
plea,
they
usually
do
it
with
such
timing
that
a
man
plead
to
the
indictment
and
stay
in
the
custody
of
the
federal
marshall
during
the
period
ready
for
trial
because
normally
that's
the
normal
way
and
that's
theory
to
the
defendant
because
he
has
normally
has
local
counsel
and
it
gives
him
an
opportunity
to
consult
with
local
counsel.
now
when
i
know
in
the
district
here
for
instance
it's
three
weeks
usually,
normally
the
time
between
arraignment
and
trial
is
three
weeks
and
they
try
to
get
the
man
arraigned
and
then
keep
in
hand
those
three
weeks
so
he
can
have
plenty
of
time
to
prepare
his
defense.
and
then
after
his
trial
the
standing
is
in
the
court
that
held
that
it
must
be
unless
the
date
contends
otherwise
that
once
the
trial
is
finished
you
send
him
back
to
new
york.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
i
suppose
so
except
that
i
think
probably
this
was
arranged.
i'm
sorry,
i
think
--
i
think
it
wouldn't
be
that
much
of
an
issue
because
the
court
itself
apparently,
as
i
say,
did
issue
with
new
writ
and
therefore
assumed
that
he
had
gone
back
completely
to
the
custody
of
new
york.
now,
the
only
point
that
i
was
making
of
all
this
was
that
if
petitioner
had
not
been
in
jail
there
is
no
question
that
he
would
have
been
under
illegal
and
a
moral
legal
duty,
a
contractual
duty
under
a
bond
to
show
up
for
trial.
and
therefore,
in
both
practical
and
legal
effect
this
is
not
a
substitute
for
process,
and
that
brings
me
to
the
standing
argument
in
this
case.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
writ
is
not
a
substitute
for
process
to
the
defendant.
the
defendant
was
an
obligation
–
was
under
an
obligation
to
show
up
in
california
under
his
bond,
under
his
duty
to
plea
in
a
criminal
case
because
if
he
were
not
in
jail,
there
would
normally
be
no
further
process
of
any
kind
to
give
this
defendant.
he
had
already
been
arrested.
he
had
already
been
given
bonds.
and
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
--
i
think
you
do
--
i
think
you
have
that
question
in
a
very
limited
situation.
i
think
you
have
that
--
well
let
me
say
i
think
you
don't
have
it
in
this
case
because
i
don't
think
the
constitution
had
been
ready
and
i
was
just
having
standpoint
and
the
basis
for
saying
that
the
question
is
not
here
and
that
in
this
case,
petitioner
has
no
standing
is
the
point
that
i
was
making
that
in
this
case
under
the
facts
here,
petitioner
was
under
a
duty,
under
his
bond
to
show
up
in
california
both
for
arraignment
and
for
trial.
and
he
would
have
to
do
that
without
many
process
of
any
kind
at
the
risk
of
having
a
bond
forfeited,
the
risk
of
being
subject
to
a
new
process
of
arrest.
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
situation
that
we
have
here
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
is
what
is
in
fact,
what
it
is
illegal
from
the
object
a
writ
directed
to
the
jailer
because
it
is
a
writ
asking
the
jailer
to
permit
petitioner
to
do
what
he
is
under
illegal
obligation
to
do
and
that
is
show
up
for
trial.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
think
they
are
not.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
that's
the
normal
bail
bond
obligated
to
appear
when
demanded
in
the
--
at
district
of
trial.
that's
right.
it's
the
bond
specified
for
in
rule
40
which
is
in
our
brief
admitted
to
bail
for
appearance
in
the
district
in
which
prosecution
is
pending.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
to
request,
i
think
it's
probably
more
accurate
term
in
the
state
situation,
that's
right.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
alternative
as
i
see
it
is
this.
the
alternative
is
that
if
a
defendant
in
this
situation
where
he's
given
a
bond
does
not
appear
because
he
is
in
state
jail,
a
district
court
would
be
obliged
to
declare
a
forfeiture
of
breach
of
the
bond.
now,
there's
a
lot
of
technical
law
on
when
and
when
that
forfeiture
would
stick
in
the
sense
of
collecting
$100,000.00.
now
i
don't
think
it's
important
here.
the
fact
is
that
if
he
failed
to
show
up
whether
it
was
a
conceivable
forfeiture
or
not
would
be
agree
to
this
bond,
the
district
court
of
california
would
then
have
authority
on
questionable
to
issue
a
warrant
of
arrest
on
people
in
appearance
which
was
one
throughout
the
united
states
as
soon
as
the
state
of
new
york
chose
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
serve
that
one
it
could
be
done.
well,
there
is
no
advantage
and
it
seems
to
me
as
long
as
that
is
possible
and
it
clearly
is,
then
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
on
the
narrowest
concept
to
jurisdiction
is
in
aid
of
the
jurisdiction
to
get
the
defendant
under
his
bond
in
the
sense
to
make
it
unnecessary
to
do
that.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
your
honor,
i
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
i
understand
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction
your
honor
depends
in
part
on
assumption
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
relations
of
function.
the
writ
ad
subjiciendum
is
also
a
direction
to
the
jailer.
the
question
is
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
there
isn't.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
but
the
question
of
whether
the
court
has
authority
to
issue
the
writ
to
the
jailer
must
in
court
intended
it
seems
to
me
on
what
is
the
authority
of
the
court
in
relation
to
the
prisoner
than
the
jailer
had.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
i
point
to
your
honor
and
i
think
considering
the
purpose
for
which
this
particular
writ
was
issued
in
this
case,
i
say
that
not
only
in
full
but
in
actuality
petitioner
has
no
standing
and
that
it
does
not
run
because
this
is
a
writ
to
the
jailer
to
enable
to
--
petitioner
to
do
that
which
we
should
--
he
was
under
a
legal
and
contractual
obligation
to
do
if
he
were
not
in
jail.
and
in
a
sense
all
it
amounts
to
is
getting
the
permission
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
allow
petitioner
to
do
that
which
he
should've
done.
and
for
that
reason,
we
say
that
in
this
situation,
petitioner
--
one,
not
only
does
the
court
have
power
to
issue
the
writ
but
two,
petitioner
has
no
standing
to
challenge
it
because
his
obligation
to
appeal
exists
by
virtue
of
the
indictment,
by
virtue
of
his
bonds
and
by
virtue
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
that
criminal
case.
and
the
only
function
of
the
writ
here
is
what
it
--
is
directed
to
the
jailer
and
it
happens
to
be
called
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum,
but
it
was
called
a
letter,
if
it
was
called
an
order,
anything
of
that
sort,
it
is
merely
a
means
of
allowing
the
state
of
new
york,
of
getting
the
permission
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
allow
petitioner
to
do
that
which
he
was
obliged
to
do.
and
so
in
this
situation
as
i
say,
both
--
it
seems
to
me,
both
that
the
court
had
authority
to
issue
the
writ
and
the
petitioner
has
no
standing
to
challenge
it.
and
let
me
just
say
that
in
our
view,
this
whole
question
was
settled
by
the
court
in
the
hayman
case
because
in
the
hayman
case,
the
ninth
district
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
the
added
remedy
under
2255
was
inadequate,
as
a
substitute
for
habeas
corpus
because
it
said,
"there
are
situations
in
which
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
in
the
district
court."
and
usually,
prisoners
are
also
or
often
prisoners
aren't
confined
in
the
district
in
which
they
were
convicted
and
therefore,
there
won't
be
any
authority
in
the
sentencing
court
to
get
the
prisoner
before
them
for
a
hearing.
this
court
said
no.
the
court
is
not
impotent
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
congress
made
it
clear
that
it
intended
a
hearing
to
occur
and
by
virtue
of
that
fact,
the
court
has
power
to
do
that
which
is
necessary
to
get
a
hearing.
and
it
appears
from
the
quotation
on
page
25
of
our
brief,
the
court
pointed
out
that
an
order
for
the
prisoner
to
appear
in
such
situation
is
not
the
same
as
the
initiation
of
an
original
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
in
other
words,
standard
habeas
corpus
ad
subjiciendum
proceeding,
and
said,
and
this
is
a
quotation
on
page
25,
"the
very
purpose
of
section
2255
is
to
hold
or
require
hearing
in
the
sentencing
court
because
of
the
inconvenience
of
transporting
court
officials
and
so
on."
the
district
court
is
not
impotent
to
accomplish
this
purpose,
at
least
so
long
as
it
may
invoke
the
statutory
authority
of
federal
courts
to
issue
"all
writs"
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdictions.
i
think
the
hayman
situation
applied
equally
here.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
of
the
southern
district
of
california
stem
from
an
indictment
returned
by
grand
jury
then
you
--
and
this
jurisdiction
is
fixed
by
the
constitution.
now
there's
another
thing
that
the
constitution
commands,
and
that
is
that
the
prisoner
be
given
speedy
trial
as
possible.
under
those
circumstances,
since
the
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
action,
since
it
has
a
duty
to
try
the
man
as
feasibly
as
possible,
it
has,
we
think
necessary,
that
necessary
to
that
jurisdiction
is
the
authority
to
request
the
state
of
new
york
to
allow
petitioner
to
be
tried
and
that's
all
the
writ
is
here.
it's
a
request
to
the
state
of
new
york
to
allow
petitioner
to
be
tried
as
he
would've
had
to
sue
if
he
were
not
in
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
he
would've
had
to
be
tried
if
he
were
not
in
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
was
being
mentioned
to
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
inquire
into
the
court's
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh
but
that
was
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
was
in
relation
to
that
here.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no
he
went
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
they
were
thinking
of
this
problem
because
it
was
certainly
true
in
1867,
that
subpoena
could
issue
throughout
the
united
states
--
state
--
states
where
witnesses
(inaudible)
to
where,
because
it
was
a
subpoena
for
the
government
witness,
a
subpoena
for
the
defense
witness
and
i
do
point
an
1867
case
where
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
issued
from
new
york
to
philadelphia,
wasn't
discussed
the
question
of
power.
but
at
least
as
early
as
1867,
they
were
issuing
with
that
--
testificandum
had
gotten
(inaudible),
i
think
clearly,
in
aid
of
the
subpoena
power
which
the
court
had
and
certainly,
in
18
–
1867
comment
couldn't
have
been
at
this
case
either
because
under
the
revised
statute
1014,
there
was
a
provision
for
removal
from
one
federal
district
to
another.
and
therefore,
it
certainly
was
not
unknown
in
1867
that
i
--
somebody
could
be
tried
in
florida
for
a
--
i
mean
someone
who
has
committed
an
offense
in
florida
could
be
tried
if
he
was
found
in
massachusetts.
the
provision
for
removal
was
in
--
i
think
that
the
first
judiciary
act
certainly,
from
much
before
1867.
so
that
i
don't
think
that
the
discussion
and
this
of
course
was
in
your
honors'
opinion
(inaudible)
court.
i
don't
think
that
discussion
about
what
a
writ
should
do.
in
that
situation
of
course,
here
where
the
writ
says
they're
completely
different
function.
i
think
maybe
it
want
to
drop
the
nomenclature
and
looked
to
what
the
writ
does.
it's
--
it's
not
a
writ
that
starts
to
pose
the
being
--
it's
not
a
writ
that
even
brings
the
defendant
into
court
in
this
case.
it
--
it's
simply
a
letter.
a
letter
would
have
the
same
effect
except
that
the
writ
is
used
because
it's
historically
known,
it's
an
old
writ.
secondly,
in
a
sense
it
gives
state
officials
the
showing
because
it
had
this
historical
gloss.
it
means
that
you're
taking
him
only
for
the
purposes
of
trial.
when
you're
through
with
them
at
the
trial,
you'd
bring
it
back.
it's
a
shorthand
way
of
saying
all
those
things
but
it
could
have
easily
be
said
in
a
letter
and
it
seems
to
me
inconceivable
that
a
court
which
has
jurisdiction
to
try
a
defendant,
a
court
which
has
jurisdiction
to
arrest
him
any
place
in
the
united
states,
a
court
which
has
jurisdiction
to
subpoena
should
be
kept
from
do
--
and
which
has
the
duty
to
try
and
assumed
possible
that
you
--
or
one
can
say
that
a
court
in
that
situation
doesn't
have
authority
to
issue
a
request.
and
that's
all
there
is
to
the
state
of
new
york
to
allow
the
defendant
to
do
that
which
he
would
not
have
had
to
do
if
he
were
not
in
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
have
to
(inaudible).
what
i
thought,
i
have
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
the
authority
to
this
--
i
have
some
doubts
in
the
situations.
i
have
to
talk
on
--
if
you're
talking
about
carbo
situation
i
have
said.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
we
are
talking
about
the
situation
where
it
is
the
first
process.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
we
are
talking
about
the
situation
where
it
is
the
first.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that
is
in
--
in
of
course,
the
decision
in
ponzi
against
fessenden.
ponzi
against
fessenden
said
that
a
--
ponzi
against
fessenden
said
that
the
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
as
to
giving
up
custody,
one
or
the
other
prisoner,
is
not
a
matter
about
which
the
prisoner
can
complain.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
my
hesitation
your
honor
is
simply
on
the
question
of
whether
it
would
have
to
be
some
kind
of
an
equivalent
of
a
rule
40
hearing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
state
court
of
massachusetts
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
--
ad
prosequendum.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
the
prisoner
happened
to
be
confined
in
massachusetts
at
that
time
but
i
think
the
--
the
discussion
indicates
--
there's
something
in
the
opinion
to
the
effect
that
if
it
were
in
federal
jail.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it
--
it
was
a
writ
a
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
but
that
--
the
courts
have
not
treated
this
binding
on
the
state.
it
was
the
state
when
it
fined
them
instead
of
the
government.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
the
reason
of
it,
the
holding
the
court
--
no,
i
assumed
that
it
was
not
normally
done
because
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
i
also
looked
at
the
brief
in
ponzi
and
in
the
argument
--
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
and
the
argument
--
and
the
court
lists
only
few
cases,
largely,
state
cases
and
not
federal
and
it
lists
in
which
there
was
a
question
even
of
the
right
to
punish
somebody
when
he
committed
an
offense
in
jail.
and
so
that
--
the
fact
that
at
the
--
well,
the
fact
didn't
came
up
to
this
court.
the
decision
is
rendered
in
1922
and
that
at
that
point,
there
was
comparatively
little
law
and
no
federal
law
on
the
subject.
secondly,
the
other
thing
that
gave
me
an
indication
to
this
effect
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
is
the
statement
in
the
case
of
taylor
against
taintor,
dealing
with
bail,
which
seem
to
have
assumed
while
it's
true
between
two
states
and
therefore
not
the
same
with
federal
states
but
some
of
the
bail
cases
that
i've
read
and
generally,
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
it
was
certainly
much
less
(inaudible)
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
that's
in
our
position.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
in
our
position.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
i
don't
(inaudible)
meet
the
legislation
anyway
because
i
think
that
all
that
the
present
legislation
said
was
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
one,
he
has
no
standing,
but
two,
also
as
far
as
the
legislation
is
concerned
that
one
must
remember
that
the
–
(inaudible)
authorization
where
a
writ
ad
prosequendum,
admittedly
didn't
come
in
until
1948.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
at
that
point
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
and
at
that
point,
under
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
not
only
the
subpoenas
but
what
had
clearly
been
made
run
through
the
--
at
the
united
states,
a
court
with
summon
cases.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
in
our
view,
your
honor,
this
is
in
exercise,
not
only
for
the
basic
jurisdiction
but
that
the
writ
in
this
case,
when
one
look
at
its
function
that
its
function
is
as
much
in
aid
of
the
warrant
process
as
i
think
of
writ
ad
testificandum,
is
in
aid
of
subpoena
process.
and
that's
why
in
my
view,
under
the
very
narrow
concept
of
jurisdiction,
it
went
as
the
petitioner
concedes
as
he
must
that
there
is
admitted
jurisdiction
in
criminal
cases.
one,
to
issue
a
subpoena
through
at
the
united
states,
and
two,
to
issue
warrant
throughout
the
united
states.
then
the
power,
then
this
writ
which
is
as
your
honor
has
pointed
addressed
to
the
jailer.
it
--
in
legal
and
in
practical
effect
if
you
look
at
its
function
in
aid
of
those
powers
which
deal
in
relation
to
the
prisoner,
that
is
the
writ
ad
testificandum
is
the
one
which
makes
it
possible
for
a
prisoner
to
obey
a
federal
subpoena
and
the
writ
ad
prosequendum
is
the
writ
that
makes
it
possible
for
the
prisoner
to
obey
the
original
warrant
under
which
he
had
posted
bail
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
where
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
it's
--
it's
exactly
this
point.
the
point
is
that
i
consider
the
writ
here,
to
the
jailer,
the
means
the
writ
to
the
jailer,
the
means
of
executing
the
warrant
power.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
if
it
was
the
first.
now,
if
initially,
when
you
serve
a
warrant,
it
means
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
that's
right
initially
if
he's
not
in
prison,
let's
start
back
there.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
if
he's
not
in
prison
when
you
serve
a
warrant
on
him
in
new
york,
he's
entitled
to
rule
40
hearing.
now,
it's
true,
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
get
him
a
rule
40
hearing
if
he's
in
jail
because
the
main
purpose
of
a
rule
40
hearing
is
to
fix
bail.
but
technically,
if
he
was
arrested
under
a
warrant,
he'd
be
entitled
to
a
rule
40
hearing.
now,
therefore,
if
he
thought
he
think
this
writ
is,
this
is
a
means
of
allowing
you
to
carry
out
the
warrant,
clearly
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
rule
40
hearing
even
though
it
does
not
make
any
sense
because
he
even
going
to
get
to
that.
it's
a
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
as
we
covered
it
in
our
brief
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
the
cases
don't
--
the
cases
go
both
ways.
it's
never
been
settled.
i
thought
that
more
common
practice
is
to
give
a
warrant
as
far
as
i
have
discovered
because
he
thought
there
is
none
since
rule
40
and
there's
not
much
authority
both
ways
and
it's
just
not
settled.
but
it's
our
view
that
doesn't
apply
here
anyway
because
this
is
a
means
--
if
this
goes
--
this
is
in
aid
of
the
original
warrant
because
this
is
in
the
way
to
keep
him
from
defaulting
and
i
point
out
that
this
is
--
this
involves
something
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
can't
tell
that
your
honor
either.
i
tried.
the
office
--
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
court
has
attempted
to
keep
record,
but
they're
not
and
also
when
they're
complete,
and
they
haven't
separated
them.
they
have
a
list
of
30
for
last
year
but
they
will
not
vouch
for
their
completeness
and
i
frankly
claim
that
that
they
are
complete
because
it's
the
local
place
like
the
district
i
think
that
--
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
just
too
low
because
the
district
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
has
held
that
the
united
states
does
not
carry
out
its
constitutional
--
its
duty
under
the
constitution
to
give
people
a
speedy
trial,
unless
it
makes
an
effort,
every
effort
it
can
to
get
them
while
they're
in
jail.
now
that
specific
and
as
a
result
of
course
they
make
every
effort
to
get
the
states
to
release
the
person
so
the
trial
could
be
possible.
so
that
the
figure
seems
to
be
very
low
but
that's
the
only
one
i
could
throw
now.
the
department
of
district
simply
doesn't
reveal
it
and
i
can
only
assume
that
with
the
increasing
emphasis
on
speedy
trial
which
has
come
into
here
the
increasing
emphasis
on
this
--
on
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
have
a
speedy
trial.
i
know
that
during
there's
many
more
issue
that
of
the
district
now
since
the
taylor
case
in
238
than
there
were
before.
there
was
a
tendency
i
think
among
the
prosecutors
(inaudible)
well
let's
wait
till
we
get
it.
and
with
--
particularly
in
the
district
but
i
think
it's
reflected
over
in
other
court
and
the
court's
own
power
instruction
to
united
states
attorneys
are
not
to
adopt
that
attitude.
under
these
circumstances,
i
would
doubt
that
there
is
an
adequate
figure
and
the
administrative
office
said
they
had
no
way
of
checking
it
for
ability.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
oh
i
think
except
the
theory.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well
that's
right.
and
secondly,
of
course,
let
me
also
say
that
i
think
it's
anything
you
would
be
not
very
conclusive
anyway,
because
if
a
man
knows
he's
about
to
go
to
trial,
there
is
much
more
have
to
be
a
proceeding
under
rule
20
where
a
plea
in
the
district
of
incarceration.
so
that
i
think
don't
seem
to
figures
are
going
to
be
adequate
or
--
i
just
can't
answer.
