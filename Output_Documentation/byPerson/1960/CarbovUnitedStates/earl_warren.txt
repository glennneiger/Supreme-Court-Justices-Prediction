mr.
wirin
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
touched
very
likely
on
the
all
writs
section,
but
--
but
you
didn't
apply
it
to
defense
of
this
case.
would
you
--
would
you
mind
just
taking
a
moment
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
could
it
--
could
it
be
said
that
the
district
court
had
already
acquired
jurisdiction
over
this
man?

mr.
beirne
you
may
take
into
adjournment
time
now
by
the
argument
if
you
sum
to
your
argument
if
you
wish?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
they
let
him
out
of
jail
in
new
york
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he's
entitled
to
be
enlarged
on
his
hundred
thousand
dollars
bail.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
anybody
restrains
him,
i
guess,
he'd
be
entitled
to
get
this
release.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
court
--
the
court
said
that
he's
entitled
to
bail
and
if
he
isn't
in
the
new
york
jail
and
they
turn
him
over
to
somebody
else
from,
would
he
be
lawfully
detained?
