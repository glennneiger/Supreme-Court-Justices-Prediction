justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
process
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
a
warrant
or
a
subpoena
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
true
in
both
civil
and
criminal
cases,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
not
quite
so
far.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
--
when
did
the
latter
two
kinds
of
writs
come
into
the
statute,
are
you
going
to
tell
us?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wirin
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
what
you're
saying
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
far
as
the
history
goes.
in
the
1789
statue,
there
was
provided
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
none
ad
prosequendum
or
whatever
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
one
was
in
the
statute
for
so
eighty
years
until
1867,
but
then
there
was
added
this
language
about
their
respective
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
now
did
the
1867
statute,
what
kinds
of
writs
of
habeas
corpus
did
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
writs
to
bring
him
to
the
court
to
testify
came
in
in
1789
and
hasn't
been
a
part
of
the
law,
the
statutory
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
warren
before
you
sit
down
let
me
tell
you
something
to
something
which
is
on
my
mind
that
you
and
your
colleagues
can
possibly
answer
about
this.
this
--
this
case
happens
to
involve
a
criminal
trial.
we
also
have
on
the
statute
books
title
28
of
the
code
section
2255.
this
title
is
federal
convict
to
make
a
collateral
attack
on
this
sentence
deserving.
that
section
also
provides
for
a
hearing.
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
if
certain
allegations
were
made,
a
hearing
was
required.
now,
that
hearing
often
involves
by
the
very
nature
of
this
kind
of
a
proceeding
bringing
people
to
the
court
where
the
man
was
sentenced,
bringing
people
from
penitentiaries
all
over
the
country
against
confederates,
accomplices
and
the
alleged
eye
witnesses,
alleged
people
who
have
heard
this
and
that
other
thing
in
jail
and
so
on.
and
i
think
i'm
right
in
saying
that
the
district
courts
have
not
felt
any
embarrassment
in
issuing
writs
or
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
to
atlanta
or
elevenworth
or
alcatraz
or
louisburg,
or
so
on
to
bring
witnesses
for
this
kind
of
a
2255
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
think
i'm
right
--
i
think
i'm
right
in
saying
that
there's
nothing
in
section
2255
which
specifically
gives
the
court
this
kind
of
power
at
all.
perhaps
implicitly
it
does
give
the
power
to
bring
--
to
bring
the
defendant
himself,
the
petitioner
himself,
but
i'm
not
talking
about
the
witnesses
necessary
to
have
the
kind
of
a
hearing
that
this
court
requires
under
that
section.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
point
is
this.
now
for
the
prisoner
himself,
for
the
petitioner
in
the
2255
proceeding
there's
probably
no
problem
because
he's
asking
to
be
brought
and
he's
not
going
to
resist
any
--
any
writ.
in
the
hayman
case,
i
suppose
there's
a
clear
holding
that
the
court
has
required
to
bring
in
and
therefore
the
district
court
has
power
to
bring
him.
i'm
talking
though
about
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
third
party
witnesses
--
other
witnesses
necessary
to
this
hearing.
and
you
have
to
sometimes
bring
them
from
all
over
the
country.
the
district
court
of
ohio
has
to
send
to
california
and
to
georgia
and
to
kansas,
and
pennsylvania
and
elsewhere
sometimes,
in
order
to
bring
in
the
witnesses
necessary
for
a
meaningful
hearing
under
2255
and
that's
utilization
of
this
very
habeas
corpus
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
possible
mrs.
rosenberg
that
this
is
accomplished
by
some
less
formal
method
or
by
some
different
method
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
the
records
wouldn't
show
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
original
hundred
thousand
dollar
figure
was
set
by
the
district
court
in
baltimore,
maryland.
justice
potter
stewart
under
--
in
the
removal
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
a
--
an
appearance
bond
so
to
speak
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
did
appear.
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
los
angeles
--
los
angeles
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
that
fulfill
a
condition
of
bond?
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
bail
bond?
justice
potter
stewart
directed
to
the
jailer
of
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
saying
--
justice
potter
stewart
unlock
--
unlock
the
door
of
the
jail
so
the
man
can
obey
a
lawful
order.
