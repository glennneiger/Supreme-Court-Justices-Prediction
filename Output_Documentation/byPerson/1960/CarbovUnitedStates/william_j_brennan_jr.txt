(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
was
a
promise
in
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
it's
no
voluntary
submission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
--
this
was
when
he
was
arrested
on
the
california
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
a
warrant
which
issued
out
of
the
california
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
was
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
only
issue
on
the
hearing
is
his
identity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
has
he
ever
appeared
under
the
district
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
brought
him
back
from
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wanted
to
–
did
the
second
writ
issued?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
why
was
that
the
second
writ
issues
ms
rosenberg?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
custody
of
new
york
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
who
turned
him
back
to
the
new
york
campus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
california
or
in
new
york?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
order
is
rather
--
the
order
is
rather
direct,
isn't
it
ms
rosenberg
and
directs
the
defendant
carbo
who
returned
to
new
york
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
counsel
and
that
they
return
here
inside
of
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
an
ordinary
course
or
did
the
court
in
california
know
that
he
was
not
going
to
come
back
except
when
such
a
writ
issued.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
in
jail
in
new
york
and
the
district
judge
or
the
district
attorney
out
there,
i
suppose,
have
left
him
a
writ
to
get
him
back
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
bail
which
was
allowed
in
baltimore.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
wasn't
allowed.
he
was
taken
by
an
officer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
–
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
when
he
first
went
out
to
california
on
the
original
writ
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
wasn't
that
was
some
kind
of
understanding
whether
in
the
record
or
not
with
the
new
york
authorities
that
he
go
out
there
and
plead
that
he'd
be
brought
back
by
the
federal
authorities
and
delivered
back
to
the
new
york
jail,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
what
was
up
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
you
mean
in
this
case
then
the
new
york
may
have
been
surprised
to
have
them
back
with
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
ms.
rosenberg
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
suggested
earlier
that
--
that
this
had
been
a
writ
first
issued
while
he
was
in
a
new
york
jail.
you
might
have
some
concern
whether
a
rule
40
hearing
is
required.
what's
the
basis
of
that,
constitutional
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand
but
i
thought
you
expressed
concern
earlier
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
assume
carbo
has
been
in
prison
when
the
warrant
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he's
been
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
happened
to
the
bail
(inaudible)
you
just
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
it
says
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
directed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
it
continue
to
be
$
100,000?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
beirne
does
that
appear
--
all
that
appears
what
i
can't
find
in
the
record
is
on
page
10
and
that's
merely
is
under
the
--
admitted
a
recital
that
he
represented
of
the
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
page
10.
the
defendant
states,
he
has
posted
$100,000
bond.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
i
gather
was
on
the
occasion
that
when
he
appeared
with
the
arraignment
and
plea.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'm
--
i'm
(inaudible)
point
really
is
whether
that
as
justice
stewart
suggested
earlier
it
becomes
function
if
he
appears
for
arraignment
free
--
