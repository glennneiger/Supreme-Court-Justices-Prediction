mr.
william
b.
beirne
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
solicitude
of
the
government
for
the
welfare
of
the
defendant
and
for
his
financial
status
with
regard
to
forfeiture
of
bail,
i
don't
think
is
of
any
assistance
here.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
court
had
authority
to
issue
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum.
in
response
to
question
from
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
government
said
that
the
question
was
not
--
whether
or
not
there
was
a
--
was
not
whether
or
not
a
district
court
had
the
power
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
testificandum
makes
territorially.
i
read
from
page
6
of
the
summary
of
the
argument
of
the
--
of
the
government's
brief,
he
said,
â€œthe
sole
question
in
this
case
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
addressed
to
prison
officials
of
a
state
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
federal
judicial
district
of
issuance
directing
them
to
deliver
for
trial
in
prison
held
by
them.
that's
the
government.
now,
with
respect
to
the
first
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
which
was
issued
and
which
mr.
justice
brennan
inquired
about
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
writ
commanded
the
jailer
to
produce
the
body
of
the
defendant
in
los
angeles
and
upon
completion
of
his
work
there,
whatever
was
to
be
done,
he
was
to
be
returned
to
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
the
bail?
mr.
william
b.
beirne
the
bail
is
still
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
the
bail
is
still
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
it
was
about
so
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
in
baltimore,
maryland.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
under
removal
procedure.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
right.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
an
appearance
bond.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
he
did
appear
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
well
he
appeared
at
the
time
of
his
appearance
and
the
time
of
the
writ
of
--
issuance
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum,
he
was
in
custody
of
the
state
officials.
so
california
issues
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
directed
to
the
jailer
in
new
york.
he
was
in
(inaudible)
by
the
way
at
that
time
for
him
to
come
to
los
angeles.
they
brought
him
to
los
angeles,
the
marshall
brought
them
to
los
angeles.
when
that
was
completed,
he
asked
the
permission
to
return
to
new
york
to
get
counsel.
he
was
ill.
he
was
permitted
to
go
and
he
was
tuned
over
to
the
marshall
who
returned
him
back
to
the
custody
of
the
state
officials.
in
other
words,
that
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
became
functus
officio
so
that
when
they
warn
the
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
at
the
bail
bond,
no.
so
that
when
they
wanted
him
out
again,
they
issued
another
writ.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
directed
to
the
jailer
of
new
york.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
now
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
now,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
commented
upon
the
person
to
whom
that
writ
was
directed
but
that
is
as
to
the
jailer
and
now
the
prisoners.
however,
of
all
writs,
as
i
understand
it,
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
subjiciendum
must
be
directed
to
the
person
who
has
custody
or
holding
him
in
restraint
so
i
don't
think
that
that's
indicative
of
anything.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
the
bail
would
be
forfeited.
except
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
before
forfeiture.
but
before
i
go,
let
me
qualify
that.
if
he
had
gone
back
there
with
the
consent
of
the
court
and
the
court
knew
that
he
was
under
that
sentence
and
was
in
custody
of
the
state
court,
there
would
be
no
fault
(inaudible).
in
case
of
taylor
--
versus
taintor
which
mrs.
rosenberg
refers
to
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
no
consent
given
and
the
bail
was
forfeited
but
in
his
case,
we
have
a
particular
situation
where
the
court
knew
that
he
was
in
the
hospital,
in
the
jail
hospital
in
new
york
and
he
was
under
confinement
under
this
sentence
in
new
york
and
he
permitted
him
to
return
so
the
court
knew
what
the
situation
was
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
would
be
no
default
as
far
as
bail
is
concerned.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
that's
right.
that
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
says
that
--
it
says
here
in
19
of
the
transcript
that
said
defendant
in
the
above
taylor
case
may
then
there
be
tried
to
serve
time
and
place
and
also
with
such
other
time
as
maybe
ordered
by
the
said
court
and
have
you
then
and
the
other's
writ.
the
delivery
of
the
body
of
paul,
john
carbo
in
the
courtroom
as
the
court
said
and
a
return
by
you
of
said
defendant
to
your
custody
shall
be
deemed
sufficient
compliance
with
the
writ.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
exactly,
return
us
to
new
york
for
his
confinement.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
there's
no
question
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
it
does
not
as
for
the
jurisdictional
question
at
all
at
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
now
your
honor
i
mentioned
in
1940
--
about
the
trial
in
1948
with
that
being
put
in
there
in
1948
and
that
there
being
nothing
in
the
congressional
debates
about
that.
that's
true.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
or
the
revises.
however,
we
take
it
that
between
1789
and
1867,
if
there
were
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
issued,
they
probably
be
issued
under
1651,
but
that
would
not
determine
the
extraterritorial
power.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
it's
arguable
that
--
that
it
could
be
done.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
that's
the
problem
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
mrs.
rosenberg
mentioned
the
subpoenas,
corporate
summons
removal
and
matters
of
that
kind
and
suggested
because
of
that
by
analogy
that
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
issue
these
writs
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum.
of
course,
i
think
that
that
fortifies
our
position
because
in
every
instance,
congress
took
the
pains
to
pass
specific
legislation
for
the
purpose
of
doing
these
particular
things
indicating
that
when
congress
found
it
necessary
to
do
it,
it
did
it
just
as
it
did
with
the
three
to
four
sections
of
c5
of
--
c
2241
when
it
added
notes
and
found
it
necessary
because
in
ex
parte
bollman,
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
insofar
as
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
was
concerned
you
could
look
to
the
common
law
for
its
meaning,
but
insofar
as
the
power
to
issue
the
writ
was
concerned,
you
had
to
look
to
what
congress
did.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i
think
the
habeas
corpus
would
lie.
it
wouldn't
like
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i'd
be
seeking
it
because
there'd
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
california
court
to
have
that
in
there.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
well
i'd
say
that
the
attorney
general
will
have
no
power
to
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
--
write
a
letter
yes,
but
it
wouldn't
confer
any
jurisdiction
upon
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i
don't
--
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
exactly.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
he
wouldn't
be.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i
think
that's
the
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i
haven't
seen
the
bond
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
no
i
think
they
continue
the
old
bond.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
you're
speaking
of
the
transcript?
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
now,
the
bond
is
in
and
i've
seen
the
records
and
--
i
haven't
seen
the
bond
but
i
have
seen
the
letter
of
transmission
in
the
files
in
los
angeles.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
that
i
don't
know
one.
maybe
that's
ordinary
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes.
they
continued
the
bond
in
effect.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
the
phase
of
the
case
because
i
was
not
in
the
case
at
that
time.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
get
your
last.
mr.
william
b.
beirne
now
that
brings
up
what
mrs.
rosenberg
was
talking
about.
she
was
talking
about
the
government
assisting
the
defendant
in
performing
his
contractual
obligation.
his
contractual
obligation
if
we
assume
it'd
be
so
is
to
appear
in
court
at
the
time
of
trial.
now
prior
to
that
time,
i
don't
think
the
government
has
any
right
to
assist
him
financially
or
otherwise,
to
bring
him
back
from
--
from
new
york
to
california.
if
he
doesn't
come
--
if
he
do
not
come
during
--
at
that
time,
then
an
action
could
be
brought
upon
a
bond
and
a
bench
could
issue
a
warrant.
but
here
the
government
in
advance
of
knowing
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
be
in
default,
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
show
up,
they
want
to
bring
him
here.
and
they
want
to
bring
him
here
as
we
say
by
a
writ
which
is
--
they
don't
have
authority
to
issue.
thank
you
very
much.
