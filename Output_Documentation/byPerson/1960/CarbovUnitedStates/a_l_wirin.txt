mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
as
the
petitioner
conceives
it
is
a
narrow
one.
it
is
whether
or
not
a
united
states
district
court
may
issue
a
writ
directing
the
production
before
it
of
a
defendant
who
have
been
charged
with
crimes.
where
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
direction
of
the
writ,
the
issuance
of
the
writ,
was
outside
of
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
district,
and
where
the
respondent
named
in
the
writ
also
was
outside
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
to
put
it
a
little
bit
more
specifically
in
this
case,
the
district
court
issued
a
writ,
it
was
denominated
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum.
it
was
directed
to
the
--
to
a
jailer
in
the
state
of
new
york,
directing
that
jailer
to
bring
to
california.
and
within
the
confines
of
the
territory
of
the
--
of
the
territorial
area
of
the
district
court
in
california,
the
petitioner
who
was
then
in
custody
in
new
york
serving
a
sentence
imposed
upon
him
by
the
--
by
state
authorities
for
a
violation
of
new
york
law.
now,
i
think
it
maybe
helpful,
at
least
i
hope
it
will
be,
if
initially
and
preliminarily,
we
put
aside
issues
of
policy
because
we
consider
them
issues
of
legislative
policy
in
contrary
distinction
to
judicial
policy
that
are
raised
by
the
government
and
hence
our
--
in
--
in
this
case.
for
instance,
it
is
urged
by
the
government,
urged
very
strongly
and
very
persuasively
that
it
is
desirable
that
a
district
court
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
laws,
have
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
and
have
jurisdiction
to
either
produce
before
it
a
defendant
who
happens
to
be
in
custody
in
some
other
district
no
matter
how
far
we
move
from
the
district
where
he
is
indicted
because
not
to
bring
him
for
a
trial
is
to
give
him
sort
of
a
--
an
immunity
at
least
while
he
is
in
custody
from
--
from
prosecution
and
therefore,
defeats
the
--
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
and
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
with
--
with
that
argument,
we
might
be
disposed
to
agree.
but
we
suggest
to
that
--
that
argument
belongs
in
the
legislative
halls
rather
than
before
this
court
have
a
judicial
tribunal
or
it
maybe
appropriate
to
make
that
argument
to
this
court
in
its
capacity
and
its
authority
to
make
rules
of
federal
criminal
procedure.
let
me
just
discuss
this
one
bit
further
and
then
i'll
move
on
to
what
we
deemed
to
be
the
thrust
of
the
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
--
yes.
i
think
so.
let
me
just
give
your
honor
--
quickly
then,
the
example
which
i
was
just
going
to
give
to
your
honor.
for
instance,
we
conceive
that
the
united
state
district
court
today
has
jurisdiction
to
issue
process
providing
for
taking
into
custody
of
a
defendant
anywhere
in
the
union,
this
maybe
done
because
of
the
present
provision
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
rule
4
(c)
(2)
to
be
particular.
that
rule
expressly
provides
that
this
maybe
done.
the
rule
indicates
that
the
revisers
committee
recommended
the
adoption
of
this
rule,
adopted
1944.
because
as
the
revisers
committee
pointed
in
--
as
it
appears
in
the
annotation,
the
rule
was
adopted
or
was
to
be
proposed,
to
modify
the
existing
tactics
which
had
obtained
up
to
that
time
that
process
for
arrest
run
only
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
a
court.
and
so,
here
is
an
example
where
through
the
rule-making
power
which
is
legislative
or
quasi
legislative,
a
practice
narrowly
limited
territorially
impaired
to
was
extended
beyond
the
territory.
now,
i'm
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it's
a
warrant
of
arrest.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
it's
--
no.
i
have
been
talking
about
the
process
of
warrant
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
which
is
in
rule
4
(c).
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
let
me
talk
--
yes.
now,
let
me
talk
about
the
process
of
subpoena.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
no.
i
think
under
the
rules
of
federal
--
either
in
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
as
we
say
changed
the
rule
prior
thereto.
the
process
maybe
served
by
an
official
of
the
united
states
no
matter
there
or
--
and
--
and
beyond
an
official
other
than
the
marshals
or
the
officials
of
the
district
(voice
overlap)
of
the
original
district.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
right.
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
now,
let
me
give
you
another
--
another
example
to
answer
your
honor's
question
with
respect
to
subpoena.
we
concede
that
the
authority
of
a
united
state
district
court
to
issue
subpoenas
in
the
criminal
cases
has
obtained
at
the
present
time
and
has
obtained
since
1793
because
in
1793,
in
the
very
second
congress,
congress
specially
provided
that
subpoenas
of
a
court
may
be
served
in
a
district
other
than
where
--
where
it
is
originally
issued.
so
that
we
say
that
initially
these
things,
the
problem
is
essentially
and
we
think
exclusively
a
legislative
one
that
when
congress
wanted
to
confer
extra
territorial
authority
upon
a
district
court,
it
knew
how
to
do
it
and
it
did
it,
certainly
it
did
it
in
language
precise
and
clear
and
definitive
in
1793
when
it
expressly
conferred
such
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
in
connection
with
the
subpoena.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
true
as
to
both
civil
and
criminal
with
the
exception
that
i
think
in
civil
cases,
there
is
a
limitation
that
it
should
be
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
within
a
hundred
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
clearly,
in
criminal
cases,
ever
since
1793,
the
subpoena
process
could
--
could
issue
and
could
be
served
by
any
marshal
of
the
united
states,
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
an
expan
--
an
expansion
of
special
jurisdiction.
and
so
i'm
just
about
to
say
this,
your
honor
that
in
contradistinction
to
the
act
of
congress
of
1793
with
respect
to
subpoena
in
contradistinction
to
the
act
of
congress
and
of
this
court
in
its
legislative
capacity
in
the
adoption
of
rules
of
1944.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
not
only
--
as
a
warrant
of
arrest.
not
only
have
congress
not
expressly
conferred
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
or
any
of
the
variance
of
the
writ
and
this
is
one
of
the
variance.
but
on
the
contrary,
we
think,
though
again,
when
it
is
--
when
--
when
one
reads
the
mind
of
congress
advocates
frequently
read
it
differently.
and
in
this
instance,
i
shall
talk
about
the
mind
of
congress
as
of
1789
and
1867
and
that's
a
--
a
long
way
--
long
way
back
and
your
honors
therefore
will
have
to
go
further
back
in
this
case
than
in
the
case
just
argued.
but
in
any
event,
we
say
that
congress
explicitly
narrow
the
authority
of
the
district
courts
in
the
issuance
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
so
that
the
authority
of
the
district
courts
was
limited
territorially,
and
hence,
until
there
is
action
by
congress
or
until
there
is
action
by
this
court
in
his
rule-making
authority,
the
old
law
is
--
stands
and
i
was
going
to
say
it
--
it
is
good
enough
for
us
in
any
event
it
stands
for
this
case.
now,
i
have
been
saying
to
your
honors
that
congress
has
made
it,
we
think,
reasonably
clear
that
it
expressly
intended
not
to
confer
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
in
connection
with
habeas
corpus.
and
here,
somewhat
in
contradistinction
to
the
former
case
which
we
happen
to
listen
in
on
because
we
were
here.
we
think
the
congress
directed
itself
to
the
precise
problem
of
extraterritorial
jurisdiction.
that
congress
said
there
was
no
such
jurisdiction.
now,
your
honors,
we
have
in
an
effort
to
aid
the
court,
attached
as
an
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
which
is
the
(inaudible)
brief,
a
chart
or
an
analysis.
and
that
i
--
i
should
be
wanting
to
talk
about
the
--
the
chart
dealing
with
28
u.s.
code,
section
2241
which
is
on
the
reverse
side
of
the
first
sheet
in
our
reply
brief.
i
think
your
--
that's
--
that
record.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
i
--
i
want
to
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
i'm
going
to
it
in
just
a
moment.
i
think
some
of
the
--
i've
confused
some
of
the
justices
--
it's
--
it's
a
yellow
colored
brief
rather
than
a
green
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
we
have
a
--
also
a
chart
of
the
green
one
but
that's
not
(inaudible).
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
printers
in
california
aren't
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
too
careful
but
as
your
honor
have
--
and
it's
--
that
one
not
the
green
one,
your
honor.
it
is
called
petitioner's
reply
brief
and
i
--
sorry
to
cause
all
that.
a
couple
i
--
it's
fearful
that
this
chart
would
be
--
instead
of
illuminating,
it
might
be
obfuscating.
be
that
as
it
may.
we
have
attempted
in
this
document
which
we
call
abstract
of
provisions
of
28
u.s.
code
2241.
it's
on
the
reverse
side
of
the
first
plot.
first,
to
recite
the
present
provisions
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute
and
then
to
give
to
the
court
a
complete
and
of
course
we
go
back
to
our
historical
analysis
of
the
development
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
as
your
honors
know,
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
not
a
recent
statute,
it's
not
a
new
one,
indeed,
it
was
adopted
by
the
first
congress
when
they
first
met
and
it's
found
in
the
first
judiciary
act,
section
14.
now,
your
honors
will
find
first,
upon
reading
the
statute
as
it
currently
reads
that
the
first
subsection
--
subsection
(a)
which
is
the
section
which
confers
jurisdiction
upon
district
courts
to
issue
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
there
is
the
phrase
in
the
second
sentence
that
writ
of
habeas
corpus
maybe
issued
by
courts
and
judges
within
their
respective
jurisdictions.
and,
we
begin
--
we
begin
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
petitioner
to
come
to
grips
with
the
central
problem
in
this
case.
when
we
begin
to
explore
what
the
phrase
within
their
respective
jurisdiction
means
and
whether
or
not
it
means
as
we
contend
it
means
within
their
respective
territorial
jurisdictions
or
whether
it
means
as
the
government
contends,
it
means
at
least
as
applied
to
subsection
--
to
c,
subsection
5,
which
is
the
pertinent
portion
here
which
authorizes
a
writ
to
issue
to
bring
a
person
into
court
to
testify
of
a
trial.
here,
the
writ
was
issued
to
bring
the
petitioner,
the
defendant
below
to
california
from
new
york
for
trial.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
--
i
think
that's
irrelevant
because
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
because
we
--
we
would
concede.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
let
me
say.
we
would
concede,
your
honor
that
if
the
petitioner
were
in
the
custody
of
the
state
of
california
in
los
angeles,
in
southern
california
that
the
--
that
he
could
be
brought
to
court
for
trial
in
the
southern
district
of
california
by
an
appropriate
writ
and
whether
you
use
the
picture
as
language
ad
prosequendum
or
you
use
the
mortal
language
which
appears
in
subsection
5
for
trial,
we
would
concede
there
is
just
--
that
jurisdiction.
i
wonder
if
i'm
--
i
see
the
--
i
see
the
light
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
beginning
to
explore
for
and
with
the
court
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
which
is
in
the
present
habeas
corpus
statute
as
it
was
codified
in
1948.
and
i'm
about
to
make
the
argument
that
the
debates
in
congress
though
i
realize
how
--
how
cut
race
inferences
from
these
debates
may
often
be
do
seem
to
us
at
least
to
indicate
that
the
phrase
within
their
respective
jurisdictions
means
within
territorial
jurisdictions.
the
phrase,
which
appears
in
the
1948
revision,
first
appeared
on
the
statutes
--
in
the
statutes
of
the
united
states
in
1867
and
that
appears
on
the
second
side,
second
sheet
and
first
column
again,
actually
our
printer
wasn't
too
active.
this
first
column
continued
there,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
your
honors
will
note
as
the
second
item
there
on
the
second
ply
sheet
14
statute
385,
1867
and
the
phrase
that
appears
has
an
amendment
to
the
habeas
corpus
statute
which
originally
was
adopted
in
1789
which
we
have
referred
to
in
the
bottom
of
that
column,
it
appears
in
the
1867
statute;
now
a
word
as
to
our
understanding
of
what
happened
in
1867.
congress
was
considering
an
amendment
to
the
habeas
corpus
statue
of
1789
to
add
a
provision
that
courts
may
inquire
into
detention
and
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
detention
violated
the
constitution
or
the
laws
of
united
states,
a
provision
which
is
in
subsection
3
of
the
present
codification
that
came
into
the
statue,
into
the
law,
into
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
1867,
but
that's
not
the
point
of
my
argument.
while
congress
was
considering
making
some
amendment
to
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
--
the
same
reply
brief
on
page
11,
senator
johnson
of
maryland,
page
11
at
the
bottom
page
in
the
footnote
and
then
page
12
also.
senator
johnson,
one
of
the
senators,
objected
to
the
bill
as
then
drafted
on
the
ground
that
it
would
commit
a
judge
of
a
district
court
to
have
ordered
brought
before
him
a
person
from
anywhere
in
the
united
states
or
substantially
to
that
effect.
a
judge
of
the
united
states
court
in
one
part
of
the
union
would
be
authorized
to
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
bring
before
him
a
person
confined
in
another
and
remote
part
of
the
union.
and
senator
trumbull,
who
was
in-charge
of
the
bill,
then
proposed
an
amendment
to
the
bill
as
then
drafted,
the
amendment
consisting
of
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
and
asked
the
objecting
senator
whether
or
not
that
amendment
or
that
provision
wouldn't
satisfy
the
objecting
senator,
because
said
senator
trumbull,
it
was
never
intended
by
the
amendment
or
the
statute
as
then
drafted
to
as
we
view
it,
and
i'm
just
paraphrasing,
to
enlarge
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
and
if
there
was
any
doubt
about
it,
if
there
was
any
question
about
it,
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
would
settle
that
doubt,
because
it
would
be
clear
that
there
was
no
intent
on
the
part
of
the
congress
in
1867
to
extend
or
enlarge
or
amend
a
jurisdiction
which
had
been
narrowly
confined
territorially
up
to
that
time.
and
so
that
phrase,
which
was
adopted
in
1867,
have
found
its
--
found
itself
repeated
when
the
revised
statues
where
adopted
in
1875,
found
itself
repeated
when
the
habeas
corpus
statute
was
again
recodified
in
the
1940
edition
and
finds
itself
repeated
in
the
present
codification.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honors,
the
petitioner's
position
is
strengthened
considerably
in
this
claim,
because
as
to
the
inferences
or
the
statements
which
i
have
made
as
to
the
intent
of
congress
at
that
time,
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
government
and
the
petitioner.
the
government
concedes
that
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdiction”
means
within
their
respective
territorial
jurisdiction
and
so
the
question
is,
where
is
the
difference
in
the
ultimate
position
between
the
petitioner
and
the
government?
the
government
says
that
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
conceded
by
the
government
to
mean
within
their
respective
territorial
jurisdiction
applies
only
and
narrows
or
limits
the
authority
of
the
court
“territorially”
only
with
respect
to
what
the
government
calls
and
what
was
known
as
common
law
as
the
petition
for
writ
ad
subjiciendum.
and
says
the
government,
the
territorial
limitation
concededly
applicable
to
that
writ,
does
not
apply
to
what
the
government
says
are
auxiliary
writs
which
are
available
to
the
courts
in
order
to
carry
out
jurisdiction
which
they
have
and
says
the
government
the
writ
ad
prosequendum
and
the
writ
to
testify
known
in
common
law
is
ad
testificandum,
these
are
auxiliary
writs
and
hence
the
limitation
admitted
as
to
subjiciendum
doesn't
apply
to
auxiliary
writs.
now
we
find
it
difficult.
we
do
not
accept
that
–
that
distinction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
we'll
head
there.
the
writ
by
which
a
court
ordered
a
person
to
be
brought
to
that
court
to
testify
stems
from
the
first
judiciary
act
in
1789.
now
this
will
make
a
second.
now
if
your
honors
will
look
at
our
--
our
characterization
of
the
--
of
the
habeas
corpus
statue
of
1789,
which
is
at
the
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
second
sheet,
first
column,
your
honors
will
note
that
that
act
which
purported
to
confer
jurisdiction
upon
judges
and
the
courts,
then
went
on
to
contain
a
proviso
and
the
proviso
was
in
two
parts,
the
second
of
which
says
or
are
necessary
to
be
brought
into
court
to
testify.
now
this
is
1789
language
and
it
means
writ
ad
testificandum
if
the
--
if
anyone
wants
to
use
the
--
the
common
law
nomenclature.
now
then
we
say,
i
think
that's
what
we're
on
to
justice
stewart's
question
that
when
congress
made
it
as
we
believe
reasonably
clear
or
i
say,
crystal
clear
but
there's
no
point
of
overstating
or
anything
made
it
reasonably
clear
when
it
used
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
and
was
talking
about
territorial
jurisdiction,
at
that
time,
the
authority
to
issue
writs
ad
testificandum
was
in
the
statute
as
of
1789.
and
we
find
--
we
find
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
habeas
corpus
statue
from
1789
to
1948,
let
alone
in
the
legislative
history
in
1867
when
this
phrase
was
expressly
inserted
into
the
statue
that
anyone
in
congress
intended
let
alone
senator
trumbull
who
was
in-charge
of
the
amendment
intended
that
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
should
not
apply
to
the
authority
to
bring
a
witness
into
court
to
testify,
but
should
apply
only
to
the
great
writ,
the
writ
whereby
a
court
inquired
as
to
the
authority
to
obtain
a
person.
moreover
we
think
your
honors
that
to
read
the
statute
as
if
not
to
look
at
the
statute
as
it
now
reads
and
that's
in
the
top
of
our
page
and
to
see
the
various
sections
and
subsections
and
to
see
their
interrelationship
and
to
note
that
section
a
is
the
section
which
confers
authority,
but
which
limits
authority
territorially
within
their
respective
jurisdictions.
then
look
at
b
which
is
not
important,
because
that
simply
provides
that
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
or
judge
of
the
circuit
court
may
transfer
a
case
to
a
district
court.
then
if
you
look
at
c,
it
seems
to
us
you
can't
read
c
in
terms
of
english
construction,
in
terms
of
fairness
or
in
terms
of
common
sense
except
to
read
it
as
a
clause
which
is
a
proviso
clause,
and
that's
what
--
that's
what
it
was
called
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
1789
and
that
all
of
the
subsections
in
c
of
which
the
authority
to
bring
a
person
for
trial
is
--
is
the
last
of
subsection
5,
all
of
the
subsections
qualify
or
modify
or
is
it
were
to
limit
the
authority
originally
conferred
in
subsection
a.
and
the
distinction
between
subjiciendum
and
--
and
auxiliary
writ,
we
think
must
fall
because
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
subsections
in
c,
all
of
the
subsections
except
5
deal
with
subjiciendum,
deal
with
the
authority
of
a
court
to
inquire
as
to
the
nature
of
the
detention.
so
we
think
that
the
reading
which
the
government
gives
to
the
statute
as
currently
read
emasculates
the
statute
and
would
give
to
some
divisions
by
one
meaning
extraterritorial
conceding
as
i
think
the
government
has
and
will
that
every
other
portion
of
the
statute
including
the
various
subdivisions
one
to
four
are
limited
territorially
so
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
true.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
correct.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
--
it
--
the
writ
--
the
writ
in
first
place,
if
your
honor
is
thinking
of
or
considering
the
problem
of
prosequendum
for
trial,
i'll
leave
it
--
deal
with
an
hour
or
deal
with
it
a
moment
later,
but
in
any
event
to
answer
your
honor's
question
and
state
your
honor
that
it
just
--
it
happens
and
we
don't
know
the
answer,
government's
brief
doesn't
afford
the
answer
that
the
phrase
for
trial
appears
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
for
the
first
time
in
the
revision
in
1948,
and
why
nothing
--
nothing
beat
until
then
so
far
that
a
statute
is
concerned
and
so
far
as
the
habeas
corpus
statute
is
concerned.
and
of
course
our
argument
is
--
i'm
going
to
make
it
a
little
bit
later
this
would
make
it
right
now
that
there
can
be
no
distinction
between
ad
testificandum
and
ad
prosequendum
at
least
insofar
as
the
government's
claim
is
concerned
about
auxiliary
writs.
they
both
are
auxiliary
writs
to
afford
the
court
which
has
general
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
authority
to
bring
a
person
to
the
court.
ad
testificandum
is
to
testify,
ad
prosequendum
to
be
tried.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
continuously
ever
since
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it's
true
only
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
it
standout
--
the
writs
started
out
in
one
section
in
1789.
in
1867,
there
was
an
amendment
and
then
when
the
revised
statutes
were
adapted,
various
provisions
were
put
in
different
sections
but
they
all
report
in
one
chapter
of
the
title
habeas
corpus.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
true.
and
also,
your
honor,
when
the
law
--
when
the
habeas
corpus
statute
appeared
in
the
united
states
code
of
1940,
there
are
also
different
sections.
but
now
in
the
1948
what
was
the
old
law
has
become
the
--
the
present
law
and
matters
which
were
segregated
in
different
sections
in
the
revised
statutes.
and
in
the
judicial
code
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
of
1940,
now
find
themselves
all
in
one
section
namely,
section
224-1.
so
what
congress
originally
adapted
in
one
place
and
what
congress
then
scrambled
into
numerous
places
have
been
rescrambled
in
this
one
consolidated
form
which
we
think
is
an
integrated
statute,
one
clause
necessarily
to
be
interpreted
in
relationship
to
the
meaning
of
the
other
clauses.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
will
say
your
honor
that
i
will
go
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--i
will
go
further.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
correct.
let
me
if
i
may
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
with
--
i
think
precise
definitiveness
because
the
matter
was
raised.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
your
honor
let
me
just
(inaudible)
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
just
going
to
say
that
this
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
aaron
versus
clark
and
in
georgia
said
that
absent
the
conferring
of
special
authority
upon
a
district
court,
its
authority
was
limited
to
its
territory.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
sure.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
and
i
didn't
know
that.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
might
think
that
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
your
honor,
may
i
say
these
things?
first,
i'm
sure
that
the
word
emasculate
was
--
was
too
strong
and
i
shall
never
say
that
again.
but
secondly
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
--
i'm
improving,
a
kind
of
(inaudible)
your
honor.
now,
may
i
go
on
and
i
would
suddenly
agree
that
there
is
that
functional
distinction
and
that
if
congress
wants
to
recognize
that
functional
distinction
or
--
you
do
recognize
or
not
recognize
as
a
matter
for
congress.
and
if
congress
wants
to
say
that
with
respect
to
writs
which
perform
the
function
which
are
subdivisions
one
to
four
mainly
to
determine
the
validity
and
the
legality
of
detention
that
shall
be
confined
territorially
but
as
to
these
other
writs,
the
writs
which
are
set
forth
in
five,
they
are
so
different
from
the
first
kind
of
writ
we're
talking
about
that
there
should
be
extraterritorial
jurisdiction.
i
think
congress
can't
say
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
but
i
think
your
honor,
if
i
may
say
so,
that
with
respect
to
the
congressional
clouds
in
1867,
there
is
a
silver
lining
and
it's
reasonably
clear
because
the
congress
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
with
your
honor,
excuse
me,
if
i'd
say
to
your
honor
that
the
statute
in
1800
--
in
1789
did
more
than
authorize
the
course
to
inquire
the
legality
of
detention.
it
authorized
the
issuance
of
the
writ
ad
testificandum.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
right.
now,
what
our
argument
then
is
this
in
short.
our
argument
is
that
when
congress
adapted
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
in
1867,
it
intended
that
no
court
shall
issue
a
writ
ad
testificandum
beyond
its
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
and
i'm
making
this
further
argument
for
what
it
is
worth
though
perhaps
it
isn't
the
strongest
argument
and
that
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
statute
as
it
is
presently
codified
in
2241,
and
you
look
at
a
and
c
and
you
look
at
the
various
subdivisions
in
c,
and
note
we
think
it
is
arguable
that
congress
intended
by
drafting
or
redrafting,
the
section
as
it
did
with
the
various
subdivisions
placing
five
as
a
subdivision
to
c
on
a
par
with,
on
a
parity
with
the
various
other
subdivisions
and
leaving
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
in
the
first
section
which
confers
jurisdiction,
we
think
it
is
arguable
that
congress
at
least
didn't
intend
to
change
their
position
which
we
think
it
took
with
reasonable
clarity
in
1867
and
that
is
that
habeas
corpus,
no
matter
the
variant
of
the
writ
whether
it's
subjiciendum
or
testificandum
are
all
to
be
issued
by
courts
within
--
within
their
territory
and
the
territorial
limit.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
concede
it
and
move
on
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
certainly
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
--
i
appreciate
the
problems
that
are
troublesome
and
for
--
for
this
court
and
i
--
i
leave
--
i
leave
that
problem
with
this
court
and
move
on
to
another
phase
of
my
argument
and
then
i
want
to
leave
time
for
reply
argument
to
my
colleague.
the
government
raises
another
question
that
i
think
i
should
advert
to
though
i
hope
to
do
so
quiet
greatly
--
and
that
is
that
the
petitioner
has
no
standing
to
challenge
the
order
made
because
the
government
after
all,
it
is
none
of
his
business
or
his
concern
of
what
sovereign
shall
try.
in
any
event
says
the
government,
the
petitioner
is
in
no
position
to
carve
for
himself
immunity
from
a
federal
prosecution
merely
because
he
is
serving
a
sentence
in
the
state
court.
now
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
standing
our
position
quickly
is
this.
if
we
are
right
in
our
central
contention
and
that
is
if
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
and
it
was
complete
excess
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
a
--
this
kind
of
a
process
beyond
the
territorial
limits
of
the
court
and
indeed
in
--
in
aaron
versus
clark
where
there
was
a
problem
somewhat
comparable
to
this
in
which
the
government
for
that
case
that
it
was
willing
--
willing
to
concede
or
to
wave
the
point
of
jurisdiction
this
court
felt
it
couldn't
accept
--
accept
the
waiver.
if
we
are
right
in
our
jurisdictional
argument
in
pendence
then
while
the
petitioner
doesn't
have
standing
in
the
conventional
sense,
nonetheless
we
think
he
is
in
a
position
at
least
to
be
able
to
suggest
to
the
court
and
to
state
to
the
court
that
a
district
court
had
exceeded
its
jurisdiction
and
this
court
in
its
broad
supervisory
authority
over
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
federal
district
courts,
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
on
a
matter
which
needs
adjudication
because
both
the
government
and
the
--
and
defendants,
i
think,
need
to
know
whether
this
writ
is
or
is
not
available
extraterritorially.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate,
though
i
know
this
is
quite
entirely
a
matter
for
your
honors
to
decide,
for
your
honors
to
adjudicate
that
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
not
because
you
would
be
kind
of
--
as
a
professor
complete
outsider
but
i
mean
in
--
in
that
--
in
that
context
but
here
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
petitioner
is
sufficiently
affected,
sufficiently
affected
by
the
result
though
he
really
can't
complain
of
it,
so
as
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
and
circuit
court
in
this
court
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
now
moreover
there
is
this
further
to
be
said.
the
matter
of
the
standing
of
the
petitioner
to
object
to
the
writ
was
not
raised
by
the
government
in
the
trial
court
at
all.
it
was
raised
in
the
circuit
court
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
then
the
government
stipulated
that
the
circuit
court
might
decide
the
matter
on
the
merits
which
that
court
did.
and
we
argue
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
government
waived
the
point
by
stipulating
that
the
matter
be
decided
on
the
merits.
in
any
event
it
is
our
position
that
since
the
matter
of
standing
was
not
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
nor
by
the
district
court,
if
your
honors
reject
our
position
that
you
made
that
the
matter
is
jurisdictional
and
that
we
have,
i
don't
want
to
use
the
word
standing
because
it
does
suggest
direct
--
a
position
to
object,
but
if
your
honors
content
to
accept
our
view,
at
least
the
petitioner
is
in
a
position
to
call
the
manner
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
since
this
matter
was
not
passed
upon
either
by
the
district
court
or
the
circuit
court,
we
would
respectfully
suggest
in
that
event,
if
your
honors
feel
is
not
a
jurisdictional
matter,
that
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
or
--
or
the
circuit
court
with
such
judgment
or
wisdom
that
they
made
bring
it
upon
this
question.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
but
i've
always
thought
that
your
honors
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh
i'm
sure
it's
not
difficult
--
too
difficult
to
decide
to
this
court.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
--
i
could
say
further
i
say
that
if
what
that
--
one
who
is
affected
by
an
order
of
the
court
is
in
a
position
to
assert
that
the
court
has
made
an
order
which
is
beyond
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no
one.
in
other
words,
this
matter
could
never
be
raised
if
one
who
is
ordered
brought
by
a
process
which
he
claims
exceeds
the
authority
of
the
court
cannot
question
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i
was
trying
to
read
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
his
views
on
--
on
standing.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
sure
he
would
have
standing
in
such
a
circumstance.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
in
a
matter
of
standing?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
plead
guilty
to
understatement
having
made
an
overstatement
at
the
beginning
of
my
argument.[laughter]
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
the
government's
position
as
we
understand
it
is
posited
both
upon
the
habeas
corpus
statute
which
i
have
discussed
and
then
the
argument
goes
further
that
even
if
there
isn't
any
authority
extraterritorially
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
there
is
in
the
all
writs
statute
of
1651
and
incidentally,
we
call
the
court's
attention
that
the
all
writs
statute
is
also
a
nation
statute.
indeed
it
was
adopted
in
1789
and
it's
part
of
the
judiciary
act
which
had
the
original
habeas
corpus
statute,
but
let's
--
let
me
move
on.
that
statute,
the
all
writs
statute
and
we've
given
your
honors
the
legislative
history
of
that
in
the
first
–
in
the
first
flyleaf
and
i
won't
take
the
time
to
talk
about
the
legislative
history,
in
any
event,
that
statute
does
authorize
the
issuance
of
all
writs
which
are
necessary
or
appropriate
--
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
the
respective
jurisdictions
of
the
various
courts.
now
we
say
that
statute
means
what
it
says
and
not
more.
we
say
that
where
there
is
no
writ
otherwise
available
to
a
--
a
court
in
juris
--
in
a
jurisdiction,
the
all
writs
statute
maybe
looked
to,
but
in
any
event,
the
all
writs
statute
merely
admits
or
allows
courts
to
issue
writs
in
aid
of
their
jurisdiction
and
not
to
augment
or
enlarge
their
jurisdiction,
and
where
congress
has
made
it
clear
as
we
think
it
has
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
that
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
is
territorial
and
limited
to
the
territory
we
say
that
the
all
writs
statute
was
not
intended
to
and
cannot
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
conferring
a
new
and
different
and
larger
jurisdiction,
in
this
case
an
extraterritorial
jurisdiction,
which
said
jurisdiction
congress
definitively
negated
in
--
in
1867.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
you
want
to
ask,
could
it
be
said?
it
is
said
by
the
government
and
our
--
and
our
position
is
this
that
there
are
two
kinds
of
jurisdictions
and
congress
knows
about
two
kinds
of
jurisdictions.
one
is
the
kind
of
general
jurisdiction
conferred
upon
a
court
in
a
--
in
a
case
as
for
instance
defining
a
certain
offense
and
conferring
jurisdiction
upon
a
district
court
to
try
persons
charged
with
that
offense.
then
there
is
another
kind
of
jurisdiction
which
is
territorial
jurisdiction
and
while
we
concede,
of
course,
that
the
district
court
had
general
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
jurisdiction
to
try
the
case,
jurisdiction
to
try
this
defendant
if
he
will
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
he
was
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
he
was
actually
--
he
actually
appeared
under
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
ad
prosequendum
issued
against
him
when
he
was
without
counsel
and
he
pleaded
to
--
to
the
cause
and
then
he
was
permitted
to
and
he
did
--
he
didn't
leave
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
don't
--
i
don't
recall
that
it
was
a
promise
to
return.
i
think
he
asked
to
get
--
for
the
right
to
get
counsel
in
the
court
let
him
leave
in
order
to
get
counsel
in
order
to
continue
with
his
service.
now
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
beyond
its
territory
to
issue
this
writ
it
lacked
it
in
this
case.
it
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
would
certainly
say
it
was
no
voluntary
submission.
he
had
not
had
view
--
to
be
able
the
help
of
counsel,
the
advice
of
counsel.
he
did
not
appear
by
counsel.
he
had
been
brought
under
orders
of
the
district
court
and
he
appeared
there
and
then
was
allowed
to
leave
and
then
when
he
did
secure
counsel,
they
looked
into
this
matter
and
decided
they
felt
the
court
had
no
extraterritorial
jurisdiction.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
to
act
in
the
like
of
the
hearing.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
let
me
say
a
word
about
that
even
though
my
colleague
was
going
to
deal
with
it
and
it's
this.
this
court
considered
section
2255
in
a
--
in
a
more
or
less
recent
decision
in
hayman
against
united
states.
we
read
section
2255
and
hayman
versus
united
states
which
did
recognize
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
or
authority
of
the
court
to
order
the
production
of
a
prisoner
wherever
he
maybe
under
2255.
we
read
that
but
we
look
at
that
situation
as
follows.
we
think
in
the
first
place
that
section
2255
was
a
special
statute
intended
by
congress
either
to
confer
or
at
least
to
recognize
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
to
bring
a
person
before
it
no
matter
where
he
was
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
that
statute
was
adopted
as
a
result
of
recommendations
by
the
judicial
counsel
itself.
the
judicial
counsel,
in
its
recommendations,
stated
that
the
--
that
the
statute
contemplated
that,
first,
no
rights
which
a
petitioner
had
theretofore
or
filing
a
petition
and
being
brought
to
court
were
to
be
diminish
in
anyway,
and
secondly
and
more
importantly
that
the
prisoner
could
be
brought
to
the
court
where
he
was
sentenced
and
this
would
be
a
greater
convenience
than
requiring
witnesses
and
others
to
be
brought
to
the
place
where
the
prisoner
was
detained.
then
congress
itself
though
and
perhaps
language
not
--
not
as
clearer
as
all
of
us
would
like
congress
to
speak
all
of
the
time
because
none
of
us
speak
--
no
lawyers
of
this
might
speak
clearly
all
the
time,
be
that
as
it
may,
congress
itself
acknowledged
the
authority
of
a
district
court
half
holding
a
hearing
under
section
2255
of
ordering
the
prisoner
to
be
brought
before
it
no
matter
where
he
was.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
--
the
legislation
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
that's
reasonably
true.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
it
--
but
we
do
say
that
as
to
that
section
or
to
that
act,
there
was
a
special
act
of
congress
in
which
the
authority
of
the
district
courts
to
act
extra
judicially
was
at
least
acknowledged
by
congress
and
with
respect
to
the
habeas
corpus
statute,
we
say
the
legislative
history
is
precisely
and
distinctly
to
the
contrary
and
that
the
phrase
“within
their
respective
jurisdictions”
has
within
territorial
effect
only
and
congress
has
never
changed
that
phrase
or
indicated
any
desire
or
intention
of
the
--
get
backing
away
from
that
phrase.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
i'll
see
--
i'll
see
your
honors'
question
before.
first
place
fortunately
or
otherwise,
your
honors
needn't
decide
that
particular
question
in
this
case,
but
that
hardly
answers
your
honor's
question.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
secondly,
if
--
if
the
proceeding
is
deemed
to
a
criminal
proceeding,
let's
just
suppose
for
a
moment,
there's
no
question
that
process
may
issue
anywhere
in
the
united
states
under
--
there
by
statutes
of
1893
which
i
call
to
your
honor's
attention
and
if
it's
deemed
to
be
a
civil
proceeding
there
maybe
some
problems
as
to
the
scope
of
the
--
of
the
subpoena
power.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
none.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
i
say
this
to
your
honors.
i
may
have
misspoken
myself
if
i
left
an
impression
that
the
policy
on
this
matter
should
be
determined
by
this
court.
my
real
position
is
that
the
matters
which
your
honor
--
to
which
your
honor
had
just
addressed
yourself
and
the
fact
that
we
are
now
a
small
nation
rather
than
a
large
one
geographically
in
the
sense
of
transportation.
that
the
rules
of
1789
should
not
apply
now
or
the
statute
should
not
apply.
these
are
considerations
we
think
for
the
congress
to
determine.
and
with
respect
to
the
example
posed
by
justice
stewart,
if
there
are
some
problems
or
difficulties
in
connection
with
that,
the
congress
can
attend
to
it
or
this
court
may
do
so
in
its
rule
making
power.
but
we
say
that
until
congress
enlarges
territorial
jurisdiction,
this
court
shouldn't
do
it
and
then
we
say
further
your
honor
that
when
congress
put
the
phrase
for
trial
in
a
statute
which
since
1867
had
within
it
the
qualifying
limiting
clause
within
their
respective
jurisdictions
which
meant
within
their
respective
territorial
jurisdiction.
the
only
inference
is
from
my
point
--
our
point
of
view
that
congress
intended
that
the
phrase
“for
trial”
is
subject
to
the
same
territorial
limitation
which
the
other
provisions
of
that
same
section
and
subsection
were
subject
to.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
i
would
just
say
this
your
honor.
i
think
it
--
i
would
not
agree
that
congress
has
said
nothing
because
i
would
say
that
congress
has
spoken
upon
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
to
1789
and
it
kept
changing
or
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
still
think
your
honor
this
is
a
problem
which
your
honors
could
let
the
congress
decide
and
did
as
a
legislative
problem
rather
than
a
judicial
problem.
