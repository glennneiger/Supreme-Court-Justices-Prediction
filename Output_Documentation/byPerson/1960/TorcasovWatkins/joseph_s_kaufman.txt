mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
your
honors
last
question
as
to
the
form
of
the
proceedings
is
very
important.
this
case
arose
on
a
petition
for
mandamus
to
require
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
from
montgomery
county
to
issue
to
the
appellant
here,
his
commission
as
a
notary
public.
the
clerk
gave
to
the
petitioner
and
appellant
here,
the
necessary
oath
which
she
was
to
subscribe
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
commission.
the
appellant
refused
and
therefore
the
clerk
refused
to
issue
the
commission.
a
writ
of
mandamus
was
then
issued,
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
was
then
issued
and
the
state
of
maryland
through
the
clerk,
filed
a
demurrer.
the
demurrer
was
sustained
in
the
lower
court
and
a
final
order
was
passed,
dismissing
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus
coming
up
on
the
demurrer.
no
testimony
was
taken
whatsoever
and
the
record
as
you
--
honors
can
tell
us
a
very
short
record.
however,
i
think
the
question
as
to
what
the
religious
belief
or
lack
of
religious
belief
of
the
appellant
is
--
was
assumed
through
all
the
courts
hated
by
oral
argument
or
otherwise
that
he
was
an
atheist.
now
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
there's
no
such
allegation
in
the
pleadings.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
but
there
could
be
no
finding
because
we
accepted
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
we
accepted
the
allegations
of
the
petition
in
it
by
a
reason
of
our
demurrer.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
i
feel
obliged
to
advise
the
court
that
we
do
have
a
practical
situation
here
that
i
think
counsel
had
entirely
overlooked
until
this
time
and
that
the
commission,
for
which
torcaso
seeks,
will
of
its
own
terms,
expire
the
1st
day
of
may,
1961.
the
commission
of
a
notary
public
is
for
two
years
commencing
on
the
first
monday
of
may,
in
each
and
every
year,
by
the
maryland
constitution.
i
point
that
out
because
i
think
it
was
overlooked
and
we
think
that
the
court
should
be
advised
of
that
fact.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor,
we
--
in
preparing
for
our
argument,
this
question
came
up
and
it
was
not
briefed
at
prior
to
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
the
commission
is
issued
and
the
term
expires
on
the
1st
monday
of
may,
every
two
years.
in
other
words,
you
can't
get
a
--
if
you
applied
to
be
a
notary
public
in
between
terms,
your
term
--
but
all
--
all
terms
expire
at
the
end
of
the
1st
day
of
may
--
1st
monday
of
may
in
the
alternate
year.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
this
one
has
never
issued.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
they
must
be
applied
for
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
certified
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
he
does
not
reapply,
he
does
not
get
his
commission
again.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
must
be
frank
to
say
that
the
normal
procedure
is,
is
that
the
state
senator
will
send
an
application,
blank
to
each
notary
public
in
the
past
and
those
who
request
them
in
the
future,
to
fill
out,
return
to
him
for
certification,
for
forwarding
to
the
governor.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
sir?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
i
think
that's
good
politics
for
any
state
senator.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
only
political
considerations
with
limit
that,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
of
the
state
senator's
feeling
as
to
how
many
should
be
in
his
county
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
must
be
certified
by
the
state
senator.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor,
i
asked
counsel
prior
to
the
hearing
and
we
just
don't
know
here
today.
i
--
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
not
automatically,
sir.
i
tried
to
explain
that.
the
state
senator
as
a
practical
matter
would
forward
to
all
those
who
had
been
--
held
commissions
as
notary
publics,
a
new
application
for
ensuing
two
years.
that
application
must
be
filled
out
by
the
person
who
held
the
commission
as
a
notary
public,
returned
to
the
state
senator
for
certification
and
then
forward
it
to
the
governor,
who
would
issue
a
notice
of
his
appointment.
the
applicant
would
then
go
to
the
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
of
the
county
in
which
he
resides,
where
he
would
pick
up
his
commission
after
taking
the
oath
that
would
be
required
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
there
is
none,
sir.
the
only
difference
is
that
initially
you
ask
your
state
senator
to
give
you
an
application
and
on
the
renewal,
usually
be
for
political
reasons,
the
state
senator
will
mail
it
to
you
as
a
matter
of
course.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
becomes
moot
on
the
1st
monday
of
may,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
which
would
be
next
monday.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
he
has
--
he
has
no
--
he
can
--
he
can
refuse
because
he
doesn't
like
the
politics
of
the
man.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor,
i
--
i
wouldn't
like
to
go
into
that,
but
this
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
is
a
political
question.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that's
the
state
senator's
discretion.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
on
his
part.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
in
the
first
instance,
usually
the
person
calls
the
state
senators.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
applies
to
the
state
senator
for
an
application.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
and
in
the
second
instance,
it
is
usually
as
a
matter
of
due
course
that
is
sent
to
him
automatically,
just
prior
to
the
end
of
the
term.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
there
might
be
many
reasons
why
he
wouldn't
send
it,
but
i
can't
answer.
there
are
political
considerations
involved.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
oh,
he
could
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
it
must
be
certified
to
by
the
state
senator.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
a
matter
of
statute,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
onto
become
a
notary
public
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
in
maryland,
you
must
have
a
certification
of
the
state
senator.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
of
the
county
which
you
reside.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
it
goes
again
to
the
question
of
the
nature
of
this
office.
it
is
a
political
office
in
maryland,
a
notary
public
and
for
that
reason
it
is
considered
a
public
office
within
the
meaning
of
that
term.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
i
--
i
would
agree
with
that.
i
think
the
state
senator,
one
of
his
political
adversaries
somebody
who
did
not
support
him
for
election
would
apply
that
that
would
be
one
means
of
countering
that
type
of
opposition.
now,
getting
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honors
please,
it
depends
the
way
the
court
decided
the
case,
but
the
terms
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
the
term
for
which
mr.
torcaso
has
applied
to
received
his
commission
if
he
where
issued
this
commission
by
the
clerk
in
the
first
instance
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
if
it
was
issued
today,
he
could
not
serve
beyond
next
monday.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
his
--
his
term
has
expired.
there's
no
office
to
fill
at
that
time.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
where
everybody
was
directing
their
attention
to
the
main
issues
and
even
if
it
is
overlooked.
we've
had
all
new
counsel
in
this
case
also
since
the
trial
on
the
lower
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals,
because
we've
had
a
change
in
stewardship
in
the
attorney
general's
office,
attorney
general
sybert,
having
been
elevated
to
the
court
of
appeals
while
this
case
was
pending
and
we
have
a
complete
new
stewardship
here.
now
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
the
--
mr.
justice,
i'd
like
to
answer
it
this
if
i
may.
if
--
and
if
--
if
this
decisions
stands
as
we
can
contend
it
should,
then
in
the
future
again,
the
clerk
of
court
would
be
proper
in
denying
to
give
the
commission
to
the
individual
concerned.
the
question
of
religion
does
not
come
into
this
question
until
he
goes
to
pick
up
his
commission
at
which
time
he
is
required
to
take
the
oath
incumbent
upon
him.
up
to
that
time,
there
is
no
question
other
than
the
state
senator's
certification
and
i
think
it
is
--
i'm
fair
to
say
that
the
governor
does
nothing
but
a
ministerial
duty
thereafter
--
in
accepting
the
recommendation
of
the
state
senator.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
our
question
for
the
state
senator's
(inaudible)
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
he
can
recommend
them
again,
but
again,
he
couldn't
qualify.
the
question
is
if
he
and
his
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
be
presumptuous
to
try
to
presume
what
he
would
do.[laughter]
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
your
--
your
honor,
i
didn't
make
this
argument
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
for
that
reason.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
just
feel
unfairness
to
the
court.
we
would
frankly,
attorney
general
finan
and
i,
we'd
like
to
have
the
question
answered,
but
we
feel
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
that
on
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
that
might
be
the
effect
of
it,
sir.
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes,
sir.
it's
a
petition
for
mandamus.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
would
--
that
would
have
to
be
the
decision
of
the
court.
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
my
--
in
my
opinion,
sir,
it
could
not,
because
the
term
for
which
he
was
appointed
wouldn't
have
expired.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
--
i
apologize
for
our
failure
to
brief
it.
we,
in
all
good
faith,
did
not
realize
the
significance
of
this
because
all
other
of
our
elective
officers
of
course,
do
not
expire
at
this
time.
they
expire
at
another
time,
but
the
notary
public
has
a
two-year
office
whereas,
our
elective
offices
are
for
four
years.
if
your
honors
please,
i
would
like
to
relate
to
the
provisions
of
article
vi
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
which
my
brothers
representing
the
appellant
contend
or
read
into
and
made
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore,
applicable
to
the
states.
we
feel
that
this
is
a
very
violent
assertion.
we
feel
that
there
is
no
support
for
that
provision
anywhere
as
in
the
cases
of
this
court.
and
we
further
feel
that
the
terms
of
the
article
vi
manifestly,
themselves,
do
not
lead
to
such
a
conclusion.
the
provisions
of
article
vi,
section
3,
provide
that
the
members
of
the
state
legislatures
must
in
their
oath
of
office,
agree
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
second
sentence
which
refers
to
the
test
oath
only
applies
to
officers
under
the
united
states,
merely
and
purposely
we
say,
excluding
state
officers
because
the
first
clause
thereof,
related
to
state
officers,
the
second
clause
is
absolutely
silent
as
to
state
officers.
and
we
would
think
that
the
old
latin
term,
“expressio
unius
est
exclusio
alterius”
would
clearly
apply
to
that
situation.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
that
this
court
has
held
that
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment
are
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
therefore
become
a
part
thereof.
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
not,
sir.
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
first
sentence
and
the
second
sentence
of
that
clause
of
the
constitution
or
stated,
the
first
sentence
relating
to
both
federal
and
state
officers,
the
second
sentence
relating
purely
to
federal
officers.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
i'd
like
to
--
in
concluding
our
argument,
state
why
we
think
this
is
a
reasonable
provision
and
why
it
has
been
in
our
maryland
constitution
for
all
these
years,
it's
been
in
the
constitution
expressly
of
some
seven
other
states
and
many
other
states
in
their
constitutions
have
clauses
which,
“and
so
help
me
god.”
even
the
virginia
constitution,
which
my
brothers
claim
that
the
virginia
statutes
were
so
pointed
towards
preventing
their
constitution
on
the
oath
of
officers
ends
with
the
language,
“so
help
me
god.”
we
think
that
all
of
these
references
to
god
in
this
court,
in
our
legislative
bodies
by
our
executive,
in
our
state
constitutions,
in
the
preambles
of
our
state
constitutions
show
that
this
is
a
religious
nation,
that
we
are
a
religious
people
and
being
a
religious
people
isn't
it
a
reasonable
requirement
that
our
public
officers
have
a
religious
foundation?
now,
we
say
that
your
honors
--
please
your
honor,
that
this
does
have
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
circumstances
of
life
as
we
know
them
and
therefore,
is
not
an
unreasonable
restriction
or
qualification
for
public
office.
this
has
been
shown
many
times
by
this
court
in
the
most
recent
case,
the
zorach
case.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
majority
opinion
stated
that
this
is
a
religious
people
whose
institutions
are
based
upon
the
presumption
of
a
supreme
being.
we
have
many
other
factors
which
this
court
has
upheld.
in
the
polygamy
cases
in
idaho
and
utah,
it
was
so
held.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
we'd
like
to
just
mention
to
the
court
something
that
was
overlooked
by
the
lower
court.
it's
a
case
of
church
of
the
holy
trinity
versus
united
states,
which
was
written
by
mr.
justice
brewer
in
the
1890s.
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
brewer
in
the
opinion
for
a
majority
of
this
court
expressly
cited
the
very
provision
that
is
now
before
the
court.
he
cited
this
in
connection
with
other
state
constitutions,
which
had
references
to
the
supreme
being,
to
our
recognition
and
reliance
upon
a
supreme
being.
and
this
is
what
mr.
justice
brewer
said,
“there
is
no
dissidence
in
these
declarations.
there
is
a
universal
language
pervading
them
all
having
one
meaning.
they
affirmed
and
reaffirmed
that
this
is
a
religious
nation.
these
are
not
individual
sayings,
declarations
of
private
persons.
they
are
organic
orders
--
utterances.
they
speak
the
voice
of
the
entire
people.”
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
this
is
from
church
of
the
holy
trinity
versus
united
states
143
u.s.457,
cited
on
the
appellees'
brief.
if
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
143,
457
sir.
if
these
utterances,
the
very
one
that
we
have
before
this
court
today
are
organic
utterances
and
speak
the
voice
in
the
entire
people,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
have
such
a
requirement?
surely,
it
does
have
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
circumstances
of
life
as
we
know
them.
and
so
this
court
in
other
cases
in
the
school
transportation
case,
the
everson
case
and
the
school
book
case,
the
cochran
case
and
other
cases,
the
released
time
case,
zorach
versus
clauson.
that
is
held,
“that
we
are
not
going
to
be
invidious
to
religion,
but
there
is
a
proper
place
for
both
in
our
society
as
long
as
it
is
reasonable.”
and
we
say
this
is
reasonable
in
this
instance.
we
only
have
to
look
to
our
various
congressional
acts
in
which
when
we
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag.
we
recognize
that
this
is
one
nation
under
god.
our
coins
that
we
hold
on
our
pocket
contain
the
phrase,
“in
god,
we
trust.”
our
national
anthem
says
that
our
motto,
“in
god
is
our
trust.”
and
the
very
opening
of
this
court
recognizes
that
the
functions
of
this
court
are
under
the
surveillance
of
a
supreme
being.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
didn't
clearly
understand,
your
honor's
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
a
happy
one?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
a
matter
of
compulsion
if
your
honor
please,
but
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
know,
sir.
we're
not
compelling
him
to
worship
in
any
manner
other
than
the
manner
which
he
desires.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
none,
sir.
other
than
--
other
than
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
others
--
other
than
officers
of
profit
or
trust
created
by
the
state.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
--
we
don't
think
that
we
are
infringing
upon
his
job.
there's
no
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
we
have
in
any
way
fringed
upon
his
private
job,
his
employment
or
anything
else.
the
only
assertion
is
that
he
is
unable
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
notary
public.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
he
doesn't
believe
in
existence
of
god,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
don't
know
what
he
believes
in
according
to
the
complaint.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
think
it
--
that
it's
a
reasonable
qualification
for
office,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
it's
not
a
question
of
not
for
one
minority
or
another
minority.
that
people
are
entitled
to
know
for
their
own
security
to
know
the
nature
in
the
public
people
who
apply
for
public
office.
and
this
is
one
qualification
on
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
we
--
we
say
he
is
unqualified.
he
could
not
receive
his
commission
because
he's
not
qualified.
now
here,
there
might
have
been
other
reasons
why
he
couldn't
receive
the
commissions,
but
in
this
case,
we
have
a
requirement
that
he'd
be
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
a
resident
of
maryland
for
a
certain
period
to
time.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
would
think
not
sir.
if
he
took
the
oath
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
if
the
took
the
oath,
he
has
the
moral
accountability
then
to
--
to
say
that
he
took
it
correctly.
we're
not
testing
this
up.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
can
a
unitarian?
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
he
can't.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honor
please,
he
is
not
--
he
has
not
qualified
to
hold
any
office
in
maryland
because
he
has
refused
to
take
an
oath
in
the
belief
of
the
existence
to
god.
this
is
not
--
we
don't
contend
this
is
a
religious
oath
as
such,
because
a
religious
oath
as
such,
indicates
a
belief
in
one
sect
as
opposed
to
another.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
--
i
think
that's
what
it
results
itself
into.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
correctly
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
correct,
sir.
but
it's
a
quite
a
different
proposition
when
you're
dealing
with
the
qualifications
for
public
office.
now,
we
have
other
qualifications
in
the
maryland
constitution
for
public
office
and
to
be
a
notary
public,
there
are
residence
requirements.
and
we
think
that
those
are
reasonable
qualifications.
we're
not
saying
that
he
is
a
--
non-entitled
to
welfare
benefits
or
welfare
legislation
benefits.
we're
saying
he
is
not
qualified
to
hold
public
office.
the
people
of
maryland
speaking
in
their
constitution
feel
that
this
is
a
reasonable
requirement
and
unless
there
is
some
constitutional
prohibition,
we
think
that
the
court
should
say
that
it
is
none
and
unreasonable
qualification
for
public
office.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
you
are
to
a
certain
degree,
i
agree
restricting
his
liberty,
but
are
you
unconstitutionally
restricting
his
liberty?
does
he
have
a
constitutional
guarantee
to
that?
we
have
many
minor
restrictions
on
liberty,
but
we
say
that
they
do
not
impinge
upon
any
constitutional
guarantee
and
that's
what
our
contention
is,
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
i
think
if
your
honor
please,
there's
no
compulsion
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
there's
no
compulsion
in
this
case
for
mr.
torcaso
to
be
a
notary
public.
we're
not
compelling
him
to
accept
that
political
office.
he's
accepting
it
because
he
wants
it.
he's
applied
for
it,
but
he's
not
qualified
for
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
i
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
that
case,
do
it
for
the
proposition
that
the
parents
of
these
children
were
compelled
to
send
them
there
under
criminal
penalty
in
the
event
that
they
didn't
send
them
to
school.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
and
this
was
a
part
of
the
school
process.
i
think
the
compulsion
aspect
is
completely
obliviated
here
because
there
is
no
compulsion
to
accept
this
political
office.
the
point
here
is
as
distinguished
from
the
barnette
case,
is
that
there,
the
children
had
to
go
to
school
under
a
paying
of
criminal
sanction
and
penalty
to
the
parents,
if
the
children
did
not
attend.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
there
is
no
such
compulsion
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
that
--
that
was
the
criminal
compulsion
there
that
they
had
a
penalty
in
the
event
that
they
did
not
comply
with
the
proceedings
in
the
schools
of
west
virginia.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
think
that's
a
case
of
compulsion.
i
think
that
would
be
unreasonable
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
to
hold
public
office,
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
think
not.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
but
that's
the
--
that's
the
point
here.
we
don't
say
torcaso
has
to
belong
to
church
a
or
church
b
or
church
c,
he
can
belong
to
any
church,
or
not
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
he
must
--
he
don't
even
have
to
belong
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
he
has
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
god
that
our
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
our
rights
come
from
some
higher
being
than
just
man
itself.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well
if
your
honor
please,
in
my
thinking,
there's
been
no
compulsion
and
there
would
be
no
compulsion.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that
is
correct,
sir,
if
he
refuses
to
meet
the
qualifying
test.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
he
--
he's
not
required
to
say
it.
if
he
doesn't
know
then
he
shouldn't
say
anything.
he's
not
required
to
say
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
or
he
can
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
he
can
--
he
can
hold
any
employment
in
the
state
as
a
ministerial
officer,
but
he
cannot
hold
a
political
office
or
office
for
profit,
because
the
people
of
the
state
feel
that
that
is
a
reasonable
requirement
as
expressed
in
the
constitution.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor,
i
--
i
must
say
that
i
think
the
people
through
the
constitutional
process,
do
have
that
right.
they
have
recognized
in
the
very
preamble
to
the
constitution,
itself.
the
constitution
of
maryland
that
they're
--
all
their
rights
under
their
--
the
maryland
government
come
from
god.
the
preamble
to
the
constitution
of
maryland
itself
is
based
upon
that
assumption.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
says,
“we,
the
people
of
state
of
maryland,
grateful
to
almighty
god
for
our
civil
and
religious
liberty,
and
taking
into
our
serious
consideration
the
best
means
of
establishing
a
good
constitution
in
the
state
and
with
a
sure
foundation
--
for
the
sure
foundation
and
more
permanent
security
thereof,
declare.”
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
i
think
they
meant
grateful
to
our
--
as
far
as
religious
liberty
is
concerned,
they
have
freedom
of
--
to
worship
in
any
sect
or
cult
that
they
desire.
because
just
as
this
court
in
the
davis
versus
beason
case,
defined
religion
as
the
manner
in
which
one
fulfills
his
obligation
to
his
maker.
this
court
recognized
that
there
is
a
supreme
being.
mr.
justice
hughes
--
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
in
speaking
of
it
said,
“one
cannot
speak
of
religious
liberty,
but
proper
appreciation
of
its
essential
and
historical
significance
without
assuming
the
existence
of
a
belief
in
supreme
allegiance
to
the
will
of
god.”
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
can
only
quote
from
his
language
that
the
religious
liberty
and
existence
of
a
belief
in
a
supreme
allegiance
to
the
will
of
god
are
essential
one
to
the
other.
and
i
might
say,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
davis
versus
beason
case,
there
was
an
oath
in
that
case
that
had
to
be
taken
to
the
effect
that
you
did
not
believe
in
polygamy
or
it
did
not
belong
to
any
organization
that
advocated
polygamy
in
order
to
hold
public
office
in
the
territory
of
idaho.
and
this
court
said
that
that
did
not
invade
the
religious
liberty
and
the
person
involved
because
in
our
free
society,
persons
who
believe
under
the
guise
of
religion
and
under
the
statement
of
religion
and
things
that
are
inimicable
to
our
society
cannot
hold
public
office.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
it
was
a
--
it
was
crime
under
the
territory
law.
that's
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
but
this
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
not
to
believe
and
there's
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
nothing
that
makes
it
a
crime.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
yes,
sir.
i
wouldn't
want
to
do
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
well,
i
--
you
stated
it
not
quite
as
i
would,
but
i
think
that
--
that
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
we
--
we
must
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
sir,
i
--
i
think
that
you,
of
course,
have
to
see
what
the
case
holds
and
that
--
then
fit
the
language
to
the
holding
of
the
case,
but
before,
and
i'm
trying
to
say
here
is,
it
is
not
unreasonable
for
--
because
of
this
requirement
--
because
our
whole
form
of
government
is
based
upon
this
presupposition.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
opinions
say
in
their
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
--
in
their
flat
holdings,
if
your
honor
please,
in
the
day
of
this
beason
case
was
a
flat
holding.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i'll
do
it
--
even
before
then,
if
your
honors
--
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i'll
be
glad
to
do
that,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
in
light
of
the
fact
that
--
that
we
are
going
to
submit
a
memorandum,
i
won't
discuss
the
question
of
the
possible
mootness
before
the
court.
to
allay
the
fears
of
the
attorney
general
as
to
whether
the
restriction
on
married
ceremonies
in
maryland
might
be
tested
which
requires
religious
ceremonies
and
say
that
mr.
torcaso
along
with
his
wife
and
three
children,
is
not
going
to
be
the
one
to
test
that
particular
provision.
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
i'm
not
sure
whether
he's
married
in
maryland.[laughter]
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
that's
possible.[laughs]
mr.
joseph
s.
kaufman
as
far
as
this,
“so
help
me
god,”
as
it
patched
to
oath,
we
covered
this
in
our
brief.
there
are
a
wide
span
of
oaths,
some
of
which
are
set
out
in
--
in
law
which
have
the
words,
“so
help
me
god”,
some
did
not.
this
doesn't
affect
whether
it's
an
oath
or
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
provision
of
the
maryland
code
itself,
which
sets
out
the
oath
of
office
on
page
4
of
the
transcript
of
record,
they
don't
have
the
words,
“so
help
me
god”
there.
it's
on
top
of
page
4
and
they
set
this
out
completely.
now,
as
far
as
hamilton
versus
university
of
california,
there
you
had
a
problem
in
which
the
--
you
had
before
the
court
the
question
of
the
--
the
right
of
a
country
to
protect
itself.
the
war
power
of
the
state
versus
the
religious
beliefs
of
individuals
and
the
court
has
held
that
the
right
to
be
a
conscientious
objector
is
a
matter
of
grace
and
that
was
the
issue
that
was
before
the
court
in
university
of
california,
the
hamilton
case
in
which
rotc
was
considered
a
part
of
self-preservation
of
--
of
the
state.
now,
as
far
as
the
coercion
aspect
of
this,
may
i
refer
the
court
to
the
cummings
case
in
which
--
cummings
versus
missouri,
18
l.ed
356
in
which
at
some
length,
they
traced
the
history
of
religious
test
oaths,
they
traced
the
question,
the
denial
of
public
office,
denial
of
all
sorts
of
benefits
is
a
form
of
compulsion,
is
a
form
of
penalty,
they
make
the
flat
statement
"disqualification
from
office
maybe
punishment"
and
they
cite
the
history
of
--
of
test
oaths
in
england
and
france.
other
examples
would
be
denial
of
a
tax
exemption
even
more
of
a
privilege
if
you
want
to
put
it
on
a
privilege
basis
than
the
--
a
public
office.
in
speiser
versus
randall,
you
held
that
denial
of
a
privilege
there
can
infringe
on
constitutional
rights.
in
the
dowd
case,
it
was
--
which
--
which
covered
political
leaders
that
it
was
--
the
court
said
that
denying
office
of
a
political
leader
will
infringe,
but
they
determine
whether
or
not,
that
it's
reasonable
under
the
--
under
the
conditions
that
existed.
i
listened.
i
did
not
hear
the
opposing
counsel
say
why
this
was
reasonable.
they
--
they
kept
emphasizing
this
is
a
reasonable
qualification
for
office
and
i
fail
to
hear
one
word
as
to
why
this
was
a
reason
for
qualification.
what
this
provision
has
to
do
with
ensuring
that
an
individual
is
going
to
do
the
job
is
going
to
perform
the
task
of
a
notary
public
or
any
other
public
office.
there
was
no
word
made
in
their
argument
covering
why
it
was
a
reasonable
qualification.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
that
this
case
was
anachronism
of
the
20th
century.
many
of
the
arguments
that
were
made
here
were
made
in
18th
and
19th
century.
and
i
urge
the
court
that
this
provision
be
sent
back
to
the
18th
and
19th
century
where
--
with
some
emotion
and
fervor
people
argued
about
religious
test
oaths
of
this
kind.
such
an
oath
as
this
does
not
belong
in
