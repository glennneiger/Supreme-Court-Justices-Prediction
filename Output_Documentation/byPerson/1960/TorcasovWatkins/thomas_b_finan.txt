mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
maryland
that
article
37
of
the
declaration
of
rights
of
maryland,
which
requires
of
anyone
who
might
abstain
to
or
aspire
the
whole
public
office,
office
of
profit
or
trust
in
the
state
of
maryland,
must
take
an
oath
or
rather
make
a
declaration
that
he
believes
in
the
existence
of
god,
that
this
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
in
any
respect
either
with
regard
to
the
establishment
of
a
religion
or
the
prohibition
of
the
free
practice
thereof.
that
is
the
first
division
of
our
argument.
secondly,
we
contend
that
the
appellant
in
this
case,
mr.
torcaso,
has
not
been
denied
due
process
of
law
or
equal
protection
of
the
law
as
afforded
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
thirdly,
our
contention
is
that
article
37
of
the
declaration
of
rights
of
the
maryland
constitution
does
not
violate
a
sixth
amendment
of
the
federal
constitution.
now
i
would
like,
may
--
may
i
please,
mr.
chief
justice
to
address
myself
to
our
first
two
divisions
of
this
argument.
a
declaration
of
--
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
god
as
set
forth
in
our
constitution
in
maryland
is
something
which
we
feel
is
more
or
less
an
important
parcel
to
what
has
been
recognized
as
the
universal
philosophy
of
this
nation
that
we
are
a
religious
people.
i
know
that
in
the
appellant's
brief,
they
seem
so
much
to
treat
in
cavalier
fashion
or
in
their
reply
brief,
the
analogies
which
we
have
made
in
our
brief
to
the
parts
of
the
declaration
of
independence,
wherein
it
is
stated
and
it
is
acknowledged
that
there
is
a
creator.
we'll
refer
to
this
very
basic
document
of
ours
because
certainly
there,
we
have
the
voice
of
not
one
individual,
but
of
the
people
speaking.
now,
we
know
that
it
appears
no
less
than
three
times
where
we
recognized
a
creator
as
a
people.
and
the
use
of
the
term
“supreme
judge,”
bringing
down
acknowledgement
of
a
supreme
being.
and
the
final
clause
of
supplication
for
the
support
of
this
declaration
with
the
firm
reliance
on
the
protection
of
divine
providence
initially
pledged
to
each
other
our
lives,
our
fortunes
and
our
sacred
honors.
the
supplication
or
the
protection
of
divine
providence
is
expressly
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence,
wherein
we
recognize
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being.
now,
in
the
appellant's
brief
they
indicate
that
so
far,
so
good,
that
it
is
mentioned
the
implication
--
on
an
implication,
but
the
expressed
avowal
of
the
existence
of
a
creator
of
a
supreme
being
is
mentioned
in
the
declaration
of
independence.
but
they
say
there's
no
mention
of
it
in
the
united
states
constitution.
and
certainly
there
is
ample
reason
to
take
that
implicitly.
there
is
the
recognition
of
a
supreme
being
even
in
the
constitution.
i
would
like
to
respectively
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
very
excellent
dissertation
on
this
and
the
virginia
law
review,
which
has
been
published
since
the
filing
of
our
brief
with
this
court,
which
is
a
march
issue,
volume
47
and
the
whole
line
of
cases
treating
on
this
subject
and
specifically
with
regard
of
the
torcaso
case,
is
fully
outlined
in
that
article.
but
at
one
point
it
states
this,
“a
guarantee
to
the
constitution
itself,
presupposes
a
higher
or
natural
law.
indeed
the
constitution
has
the
classic
historical
case
of
the
great
social
contract.
and
17th
and
18th
century
contract
theorist
would
be
hard
for
us
to
demonstrate
a
binding
nature
of
civil
laws
promulgated
under
a
government
created
by
the
social
contract,
unless
an
obligation
to
observe
that
contract
itself
was
imposed
by
a
higher
authority
than
man.”

mr.
chief
justice,
volume
47,
march
1961.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
let
me
state
this.
we
are
primarily
concerned
here
with
a
question
of
a
right
which
we
feel
has
been
reserved
to
a
state.
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
no
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
correct.
no,
sir
--
your
honor
or
mr.
justice,
we
--
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
the
state
of
the
federal
government
could
do
that.
i
--
i
would
like
to
state
this
and
i
--
i
think
this
question
resolved
itself
into
this
premise,
can
a
state
constitutionally
exclude
an
atheist
from
public
office?
it
probably
resolved
itself
into
that.
and
the
appellants
in
their
brief
have
relied
heavily
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
atheist
is
encompassed
by
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
we
feel
that
religion
as
defined
and
as
not
defined,
but
is
mentioned
in
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
that
certainly
as
a
group,
it
does
not
include
the
atheist.
it
--
it
certainly,
we
--
we
have
a
decision
and
the
language
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
several
cases
wherein
they
have
indicated
that
any
definition
or
any
idea
of
religion
must
relate
itself
to
some
type
of
a
supreme
being.
in
the
case
of
davis
versus
beason,
which
was
a
case
many
years
ago,
decided
with
regard
to
plural
marriages
out
in
the
territory
of
idaho
and
the
celestial
marriages
as
they
call
them,
under
various
forms
of
--
resumed
at
that
time
the
mormon
religion
and
other
types
that
of
religious
sects
that
believed
in
plurality
of
wives.
and
the
decision
in
that
case
the
court
says,
“the
term
"religion",
as
referred
to
ones
views
of
his
relations
to
his
creator
and
to
the
obligations
they
impose
of
reverence
for
his
being
and
character
of
obedience
to
his
will.”
and
again,
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
--
mr.
chief
justice
hughes,
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
macintosh,
and
i
know
that
that
has
been
later
overruled
by
schwimmer
case
but
nonetheless,
in
that
particular
case,
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
did
mention
his
idea
of
religion.
and
he
says,
“both
the
essence
of
religion
is
belief
in
the
relation
to
god,
involving
duties
superior
to
those
arising
from
any
human
relation.”
i
would
certainly
seem
to
take
care
of
what
are
--
the
appellants
have
talked
about
regarding
humanism
and
things
of
that
nature.
and
we
feel
that
--
that
when
this
particular
sanction
is
placed
upon
an
atheist
with
regard
to
public
office
in
maryland,
that
we
are
not
setting
up
some
preference
of
religion
or
preference
of
theism
over
non-theism,
whatever
you
might
wish
to
call
it.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
it
was
past
in
--
in
this
present
form,
mr.
justice
black.
it
was
in
the
constitution
of
1867.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
in
various
forms,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
--
it
was.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
in
1867?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
at
the
time
of
the
--
when
--
right
after
the
revolutionary
war
has
--
the
appellant
has
already
--
mr.
pfeffer
has
already
indicated
originally
at
--
has
language
pertaining
to
a
person
who
only
a
member
of
the
christian
religion
and
it
was
later,
i
think
was
1854,
that
was
amended
to
embrace
not
only
christians,
but
jews
as
well.
in
1867,
which
was
the
--
the
present
constitution
we
have
in
maryland
came
from
that
day.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
--
who?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
oh,
absolutely
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
--
john
--
john
--
charles
carroll,
was
not
allowed
to
hold
public
office.
the
first
20
years
of
his
what
might
be
termed
to
his
public
life.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
because
they
barred
catholics
in
maryland
at
that
time,
contrary
to
the
fact
that
everybody
assumes
that
maryland
was
one
of
the
cradles
of
catholicism
in
this
country.
it
was,
but
then
there
was
a
period
when
they
had
certain
sedation
or
acts
barring
religious
freedom
for
the
period
almost
a
blackout
of
40
years
in
maryland,
where
catholics
as
well
as
jewish
people
cannot
hold
office.
and
there
was
a
--
a
result
of
charles
carroll
or
carrollton's
writing
numerous
articles,
which
he
signed
as
the
first
citizen
of
maryland.
anonymously,
people
wondered
who
it
was
and
they
find
out
who
it
was.
they
finally
passed
an
act
which
removes
the
bar
to
catholics
to
public
office.
that
was
about
--
that
was
of
course,
before
the
--
that
was
still
under
the
--
as
a
proprietary
colony
it
was
--
before
it
was
a
state.
i
would
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no.
the
--
the
main
source
for
maryland
would
be
the
first
attorney
general,
luther
martin.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i'm
--
i'm
referring
to
that
too,
mr.
justice.
charles
carroll
did
not.
mr.
luther
martin,
thomas
mercer,
chase
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
chase
and
several
others,
but
charles
carroll
did
not.
he
signed
the
declaration
of
independence.
but
--
and
i
might
say
mr.
luther
martin
was
a
very
liberal
man.
he
finally
left
to
his
own
devices,
i'm
not
certain
that
this
would
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
i
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
might
point
this
out
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
pardon,
sir?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
i'm
sure,
he's
expressed
himself
on
--
because
of
his
own
situation,
mr.
justice,
but
specifically
with
regard
to
this
question
of
a
declaration
in
beliefs
in
the
existence
of
god
as
a
prerequisite
to
public
office,
i
--
i
have
no
knowledge
of
what
he
might
have
said
with
regard
to
that.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
they
did
not
believe
in
some
sort
of
a
supreme
--
a
deity
or
a
supreme
being,
in
all
honestly,
i
would
have
to
state
that
according
to
the
interpretation
of
the
laws,
as
we
have
it,
they
could
not
become
a
notary.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
if
it
please
you,
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
state
this
that,
as
of
the
appellants
have
set
forth
in
their
brief,
you
cannot
have
any
discussion
of
this
question
without
some
discussion
of
the
area,
of
course,
of
the
separation
of
church
and
the
state.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
however,
when
you
review
the
old
series
of
cases
and
--
and
many
lines
on
this,
we
--
we
find
out
that
there
are
certain
places
whether
it
pinpoints
a
contact,
where
there
has
been
interchanges
as
it
were.
we
feel
that
the
--
the
cases
which
this
court
had
decided
have
allowed
the
states
to
put
reasonable
conditions
on
certain
facets
of
religious
liberty,
where
the
public
welfare
has
required
it.
now,
we
would
like
to
just
call
attention
to
some
of
it.first
of
all,
you
have
loyalty
of
the
cases.
you
have
a
case
many
years
ago
in
california,
hamilton
versus
state
of
california.
where
two
young
men,
who
were
members
of
the
epworth
league
and
who
were
conscientious
objectors
and
who
did
not
wish
to
join
the
rotc
unit
at
the
state
university.
refused
to
take
an
oath,
which
would
tell
them
to
support
and
defend
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
i
presumed
the
constitution
of
california
and
also
become
a
part
of
the
rotc
unit
at
the
university.
i
think
that
case
is
quite
analogous
to
this
case
because
there
was
no
compulsion
for
those
two
boys
to
go
to
the
university.
they
went
there
as
a
matter
of
privilege.
just
as
in
this
case,
there's
no
compulsion
for
mr.
torcaso
to
become
a
notary
public.
he
has
suffered
no
penalty.
he
suffers
no
punishment.
there's
no
abridgment
of
his
own
belief
as
an
atheist
to
luxury
in
that
belief
as
long
as
he
wants.
if
he
seeks
public
office,
which
is
a
privilege,
then
the
state
places
that
sanction
on
him.
now
we
feel
that
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
justice,
the
courts
have
almost
universally
held
that
there
is
no
property
right
in
public
office
that
there
is
--
the
public
office
is
merely
a
matter
of
privilege,
it's
not
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
probably
would
not
like
it,
mr.
justice,
but
i
would
be
compelled
to
accept
it.
we
feel
that
the
state
can
place
these
reasonable
safeguards
--
the
--
a
touchstone
of
the
--
of
the
whole
situation
seems
to
be
the
substantial
--
substantiality
of
the
interest
which
to
seek
--
which
the
state
seeks
to
protect,
as
balanced
against
the
gravity
of
the
invasion
of
the
first
amendment.
and
we
feel
that
in
this
torcaso
case
that
the
state
of
maryland
was
not
unreasonable
in
trying
to
set
up
some
safeguards
to
--
assure
to
itself
a
security
of
good
conduct
for
public
officials.
now,
it
is
not
as
the
appellant's
state
that
a
reason
while
we
in
maryland
setup
a
question
of
a
declaration
of
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
god
because
of
the
fact
of
--
of
merely
with
regard
to
the
oath
or
an
order
we
might
administer
or
the
fact
that
a
person
who
administers
oath
should
take
an
oath.
actually,
as
it
has
been
discussed
here
previously,
the
state
of
maryland
provides
for
an
affirmation
for
a
quaker
or
assembly
of
friends.
they
can
--
a
person
can
affirm
as
a
witness,
they
can
affirm
to
qualify
for
any
office
in
maryland.
we
do
not
allow
atheist
to
testify
in
court
however,
but
the
--
the
theory
behind,
they
either
by
affirmation
or
by
an
oath,
or
by
a
declaration
of
acknowledging
the
existence
of
god,
is
for
the
purpose
of
equating
that
declaration
of
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
god
with
moral
accountability
for
one's
actions.
and
that
goes
clear
back
to
the
earliest
inceptions
of
our
government,
in
this
country
and
in
maryland,
where
we
find
that
tradition
just
to
this
court
opens
with
the
salutation,
god
save
the
united
states,
in
this
court.
the
--
the
acknowledgment
by
public
officials,
“so
help
me
god,”
that
we
are
evaluating
the
oath
in
the
terms
of
moral
accountability
for
our
actions.
and
we
feel
it
is
a
reasonable
safeguard
for
a
state
to
require
public
officials
to
make
such
a
declaration.
it
doesn't
matter
of
course,
whether
they'd
be
methodists,
catholics,
jews,
whatever
they
might
be.
it's
the
acknowledgement
of
some
supreme
being
who
will
judge
their
actions
and
hold
them
accountable
for
them.
i
might
add
that
maryland
is
one
of
the
few
states
but
still
requires
a
religious
ceremony
at
a
marriage.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
particular
type
of
religious
ceremony,
but
we
do
not
recognize
justice
of
the
peace
marriages
in
maryland.
we
still
hold
to
the
fact
that
a
man
can
be
arrested
and
tried
for
blasphemy
in
maryland.
and
we
feel
that
in
our
belief
and
traditions
as
a
state,
that
we
are
not
unreasonable
in
requiring
this
safeguard
from
our
public
officials.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
it
--
i
--
i
feel
that
that
would
be
certainly
too
restricted.
i
think
the
--
the
idea
of
--
of
the
atheist
that
we're
faced
with
here
is
certainly
different
from
debating
a
--
a
boring
large
segments
of
--
of
recognized
religions,
such
as
those
who
might
believe
in
zionism
or
judaism
and
so
forth.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
about
the
buddhist.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
hearken
back
to
the
cases
that
i
have
mentioned
like
the
hamilton
case.
i
hearken
back
to
the
loyalty
oath
case,
the
--
the
(inaudible)
case
which
came
from
maryland
under
the
ober
act,
where
we
required
people
to
take
an
oath
that
they
did
not
belong
to
any
organization
that
believed
in
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
so
forth.
i
--
i
feel
that
in
any
of
these
situations,
it's
a
question
of
some
perhaps
abridgment
of
either
freedom
of
speech
or
some
abridgment
or
freedom
of
religion,
but
the
question
is
as
--
as
this
court,
i
feel,
has
recognized,
like
in
the
zorach
case
whether
or
not,
the
common
will,
the
welfare
of
the
people
justify
it.
we
have
--
certainly
there's
been,
as
i
state,
some
interchange
between
a
church
and
the
state
in
cases
where
you
have
a
program
of
exempting
church
property
from
taxation
where
you
have
a
question
of
a
federal
money
for
lunches
in
schools.
there
are
numerous
situations.
i
think
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out,
it
isn't
the
question
that
there
has
to
be
a
hostility
or
an
--
an
inimicality
between
a
church
and
the
state,
but
it's
a
question
where
they
should
try
to
accommodate
the
two
separate
institutions.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
mr.
justice
black,
it's
a
question
whether
this
would
be
hostility.
they
are
not
persecuting
him
in
any
way.
he
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
say
that
in
the
zorach
case,
that
mr.
justice
douglas
said
that
the
--
this
separation
does
not
require
us
to
go
so
far
as
to
be
hostile
or
show
hostility
between
the
church
and
the
state,
that
there
should
be
some
type
of
an
accommodation.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
--
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
i
just
like
to
state
in
--
in
closing,
i
--
i
would
presume
probably
the
next
situation
would
be
maybe
as
to
how
some
atheist
might
desire
to
obtain
a
mandamus
of
some
type
on
the
clerk
of
the
court
to
get
a
license
to
have
a
religious
--
or
to
be
married
without
a
religious
ceremony.
i
don't
know
how
an
atheist
would
get
married
in
maryland
under
the
present
law.
we
feel
that
there
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
not
yet,
mr.
justice
[laughter].
i'm
--i'm
proposing
that
that
probably
is
in
the
outset.
and
i
--
i
feel
that
we
have
a
right
to
--
to
have
these
certain
safeguards.
the
--
we're
not
an
irreligious
people.
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
many
quotes
from
the
various
cases
which
were
in
our
brief,
but
with
this
court,
i'm
sure,
well
aware
of
--
that
we
feel
that
all
the
state
of
maryland
has
done
is
to
set
up
the
safeguards
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
language
said,
justice
henderson,
“that
this
requirement
to
declare
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
god
on
a
part
of
a
notary
public
or
such
a
security
of
good
conduct
on
the
part
of
public
officials
that
this
requirement
was
not
so
unreasonable
as
to
be
invidious
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.”
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
believe
in
the
petition,
mr.
justice,
that
if
he
filed
for
the
mandamus,
he
sets
forth
in
there
that
he
is
an
atheist.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
or
maybe
not.
i
--
certainly
as
counsel
has
--
has
so
characterized
him
and
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
as
long
as
they
won't
take
the
--
an
oath
in
the
declaration
of
the
belief
in
the
existence
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
--
of
god.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
our
court
of
appeals
used
this
language
and
said
that
they
did
not
feel
that
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
was
ever
intended
to
embrace
and
encompass
the
ungodly.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
the
ungodly.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
he
has
--
just
for
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
judge
henderson
and
his
language
in
the
opinion
on
that
case
said
that
in
his
--
it's
his
interpretation
that
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
was
never
intended
to
encompass
the
ungodly.
thank
you.
