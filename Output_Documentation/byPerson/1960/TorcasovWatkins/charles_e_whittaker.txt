justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
in
maryland,
mr.
speiser,
is
there
as
statutory
oath
that
must
be
taken?
i
--
i'm
not
talking
about
this
declaration,
but
a
statutory
form
of
oath?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
does
it
contain
the
word
or
phrase,
“so
help
me
god?”
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
is
not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
who
i'd
like
to
see
it.
i'll
look
for
it
and
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
it
(inaudible)
from
the
time
issued
or
from
the
time
applied
for?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
another
issue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
automatic?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
as
between
that
renewal
and
the
opinion
of
the
initial
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
should
they
(inaudible)
you
say
this
issue
becomes
moot?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
is
mandamus.
i
think
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
an
order
requiring
the
clerk
to
issue
this
--
to
this
position
without
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
with
the
judgment
being
down
next
tuesday
in
favor
of
petitioner,
could
it
be
carried
out?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
had
no
constitutional
right
to
be
a
notary
public.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
didn't
he
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
excluded
on
religious
grounds?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
this
doesn't
mean
all
that
another
person
who
does
not
in
fact
believes
in
god
and
he's
willing
to
confess
it
can
hold
an
office
of
profit
or
trust
in
maryland.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
question
is
whether
or
not
that's
permissible
on
the
first
amendment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
unless
you
--
now
--
now,
what
would
you
--
how
would
you
claim
or
get
along
the
language
of
the
west
virginia
(inaudible)
case,
the
barnettee
--
the
barnettee
case,
that
one
may
not
be
compelled
to
utter
what
is
not
in
his
mind.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
he's
just
an
agnostic
and
he
said
now,
in
all
good
(inaudible)
i
just
don't
know
for
the
--
and
therefore,
i
refuse
to
say
that
i
believe
in
god.
that
man
cannot
hold
office
of
trust
for
profit
in
maryland?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
would
be
would
it
not,
if
he
really
didn't
know
and
he
was
uncertain,
wouldn't
that
be
to
make
him
say
something
that
was
not
in
his
mind?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
those
who
are
willing
to
say
can
hold
office
for
trust
or
profit
(inaudible)
but
those
who
are
unwilling
to
say
it
because
they're
doubtful
are
denied
to
it
or
denied
the
right
of
one
of
the
