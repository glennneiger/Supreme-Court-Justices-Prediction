mr.
lawrence
speiser
mr.
chief
justice.
for
the
question
as
to
whether
atheists
are
permitted
to
affirm,
there
has
been
one
decision
that
i
know
of
in
which
the
issue
was
specifically
raised
and
that
was
a
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
decision,
petitioned
(inaudible)
which
summarily
reversed
without
opinion,
a
denial
of
naturalization
of
an
atheist,
which
originally
arose
in
the
district
court
of
hawaii,
as
cited
on
our
brief.
the
government
confessed
error
on
it,
on
the
grounds
that
the
word,
“oath”
included
affirmation
and
there
was
no
other
inquiry
to
go
beyond
that.
and
there
was
in
the
record
that
the
man
was
an
atheist
and
he
was
subsequently
naturalized
by
making
affirmation.
i'm
going
to
discuss
the
questioning
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
classification
that's
been
made
by
this
position
of
the
maryland
constitution.
in
order
to
do
so,
we
must
look
at
the
--
the
groups
that
are
affected
by
it,
the
group
that's
carved
out
in
the
purpose
of
it.
as
has
been
stated,
the
declaration
of
belief
in
god
covers
all
office
holders.
it
is
not
restricted
to
notaries.
it's
not
restricted
to
those
who
give
oaths.
it
covers
the
governor,
secretary
of
state,
judges,
council
men,
clerks
of
court,
register
of
wills,
all
state
officers
acted
in
general,
all
of
them
were
covered
by
this.
the
court
of
appeals
below
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
notaries
were
in
a
different
position,
because
they
give
an
oath.
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
no.
and
mr.
pfeffer
pointed
out
others
beside
notaries
do
give
oaths
and
take
statements
under
oath.
but
a
notary
or
any
of
the
others
that
do
this
are
barely
performing
a
ministerial
duty.
it's
not
their
function
to
look
into
the
religious
beliefs
of
individuals.
they
aren't
supposed
to
be
religious
teachers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
provision
article
39,
which
provides
that
various
--
that
individuals
can
make
affirmations,
that's
the
most
effectual
confirmation
by
the
attestation
of
a
divine
being.
now,
you
would
think
that
if
that's
the
case
that
they
would
perhaps
have
a
qualification
on
the
part
of
notaries
or
others
to
have
some
knowledge
of
religious
practices
of
what
the
various
sects
hold,
what's
the
best
way
in
which
a
--
an
attestation
may
be
made,
but
they
have
no
requirement
like
that.
and
i
think
that
a
requirement
such
as
that
would
be
unreasonable,
but
they
--
they
haven't
done
that.
now,
42
other
states
and
the
federal
government
and
england,
even
with
an
established
church,
permit
oaths
to
be
given
by
judges
and
the
other
individuals
without
determining
if
they
believe
in
a
supreme
being
or
in
moral
accountability.
the
clerk
of
this
court
just
when
this
session
started,
swore
in
attorneys
to
be
members
of
the
bar
of
this
court
and
the
members
of
this
court
do
not
know
whether
that
clerk
believes
in
a
supreme
being
or
moral
accountability,
that
members
of
this
court
don't
know
what
the
other
members
of
the
court
believe
in
this
respect,
even
though
you've
all
taken
an
oath
when
you
assumed
your
role
as
justices
of
this
court,
because
the
constitution
forbids
a
religious
test
for
public
office.
now,
the
--
the
question
has
been
raised,
“well
shouldn't
you
believe
in
the
--
in
the
sanctity
of
the
oath
at
least,
which
is
equated
by
the
court
of
appeals
below?”
but
that
isn't
what
the
--
the
oath
says
--
that
the
declaration
says.
it
says
that
you
must
have
a
belief
in
the
supreme
being.
the
court
below
equated
it
to
include
a
belief
in
a
--
in
the
sanctity
of
oath
and
--
and
some
other
things
perhaps.
now,
from
this
entire
group
of
officers
of
--
of
the
state,
you're
carving
out
several
--
several
types
of
individuals.
you
carve
out
first
of
all,
nonbelievers
in
the
existence
of
god.
you
carve
out
nonbelievers
in
moral
accountability
under
dispensation
of
god.
they
took
from
the
section
covering
witness
and
jurors,
an
--
an
additional
qualification
which
seems
to
exist
and
said
that
this
is
equated
to
a
belief
in
god.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
dangers
that
can
be
shown
when
we
get
into
this
question
as
to
trying
to
determine
what
god
is
being
sworn
to
by
the
various
meanings
of
what
is
god
and
the
fact
that
the
court
below
appended
a
qualification
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
--
the
oath,
the
maryland
declaration
of
rights
says,
“no
religious
test
shall
be
required
other
than
a
belief
in
god.”
they
tacked
on
a
belief
in
sanctity
of
oaths.
agnostics
are
barred
as
well,
because
agnostics
can't
say
they
believe
in
god.
agnostics
have
some
doubts.
they
don't
know.
as
mr.
pfeffer
pointed
out
members
of
non-theistic
religions
are
barred.
and
then
finally,
there
is
the
group,
those
who
just
object
to
test
those.
who
may
in
fact,
believe
in
god,
who
may
in
fact,
believe
in
moral
accountability,
who
may
in
fact,
believe
in
a
--
a
system
of
rewards
and
punishments,
but
who'll
take
the
position,
it's
none
of
the
business
of
a
state
to
ask
me
to
find
out.
now,
they
are
covered
here,
because
this
is
a
declaration
of
belief
in
god,
which
is
required
under
article
37.
all
these
are
based
on
beliefs,
not
based
on
passed
acts,
on
associations.
they're
based
on
none
of
those
factors,
only
beliefs.
now,
in
order
to
determine
whether
this
classification
is
reasonable,
we
have
to
look
at
--
at
history.
we
have
to
look
at
--
at
the
purpose
of
this.
and
implicit
in
this
is
the
question,
“is
it
reasonable
to
disbelieve
or
mistrust
all
of
these
that
i've
mentioned?”
mr.
lawrence
speiser
our
basis
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause
as
to
whether
there's
any
substantive
relationship
between
the
disqualification
and
a
holding
of
office
under
a
state.
the
states
are
--
are
barred
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
depriving
individuals
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
and
i'm
raising
the
question
of
a
classification
that's
made
here
irrespective
of
the
--
of
the
first
amendment
arguments
that
have
been
made
already.
now,
the
broad
sweep
of
history
is
very
much
against
the
fact
that
we
cannot
trust
in
public
office,
nonbelievers
or
we
cannot
believe
nonbelievers
in
office,
who
take
an
oath
that
they
will
support
and
defend
the
constitution
or
to
perform
the
functions
of
their
task.
article
vi,
i
think,
is
a
good
argument
in
favor
of
this
point
of
view.
we
have
the
president
of
the
united
states,
who
maybe
a
nonbeliever,
because
our
constitution
forbids
us
to
find
out
whether
he's
a
nonbeliever.
yet,
he
takes
an
oath
of
office.
we
have
to
rely
on
his
good
faith
in
taking
that
oath
--
oath
of
office
without
finding
out
whether
he
believes
in
the
supreme
being
or
not.
all
of
federal
officers,
all
of
the
judges,
again,
we
rely
on
this
without
knowing
whether
or
not,
they
believe
in
a
supreme
being.
this
is
an
article
vi
and
it
was
thought
of
in
that
context.
we've
eliminated
in
most
states,
many
of
them
did
not
have
it,
disqualification
based
on
belief.
england,
which
even
now
has
an
established
church,
doesn't
require
such
a
statement
as
this
of
a
belief
in
god.
then,
the
question
comes
well
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
there's
nothing
that
i
know
of
that's
the
equivalent
of
requiring
a
belief
on
the
supreme
being.
they
do
promise
to
--
to
perform
their
task,
but
they
--
they
have
nothing
beyond
that
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
or
they
will
perform
their
office,
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that's
right.
and
they
have
a
right
to
affirm
there
and
by
a
statute
of
england
of
the
1868
as
i
recall,
they
eliminate
any
disqualification
to
--
for
atheist
and
being
able
to
take
public
office
in
england.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
obviously
we're
not
depending
wholly
on
it
but
i
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
--
but
i'm
--
but
i'm
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
--
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
--
i'm
suggesting
that
now
that
an
argument
can
be
made
divorced
of
the
first
amendment
incorporation
in
the
fourteen
amendment
based
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
classification.
let
me
suggest
an
additional
reason.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
he
has
some
other
duties,
but
--
but
the
duties
are
ministerial.
there's
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
the
--
i
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
which
--
which
oath
are
you
referring
to,
mr.
justice
black?
mr.
lawrence
speiser
they
permit
affirmation
in
maryland.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
they
--
and
they
have
oaths
in
maryland
and
the
usual
oath
by
practice
if
for
no
other
reason,
has
the
words,
“so
help
me
god”
included
on
it.
but
in
--
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
the
fact
that,
“so
help
me
god”
is
--
is
not
a
substantive
qualification
for
taking
an
oath,
but
is
--
a
--
a
procedural
device.
it's
not
included
for
example,
in
the
oath
of
office
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
the
constitution
clearly
sets
out
that
he
shall
take
this
oath
and
the
oath
is
spelled
out.
it
says,
“swear
or
affirm.”
it
doesn't
have
the
words,
“so
help
me
god”
attached
to
that
oath.
yet,
president
kennedy
is
probably
all
of
the
other
presidents,
all
of
whom
have
--
have
sworn
rather
than
affirmed,
have
put
in
the
words,
“so
help
me
god.”
does
that
make
them
--
does
that
disqualify
them
from
being
the
president
because
they
failed
to
take
the
oath
that
set
out
in
the
constitution?
i
think
the
answer
is,
no.
that
“so
help
me
god,”
is
just
the
procedural
device
by
which
an
oath
is
taken,
but
it
is
not
a
qualification
of
a
belief
in
god
merely
because
they
added
on.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes.
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
i
--
see,
i
believe
it's
set
out
in
the
--
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
yes.
it
starts
out
“in
the
presence
of
almighty
god”
and
then
it
does
not
set
out,
“so
help
me
god”
at
the
end
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
it
is
not.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
it's
not
up
to
him
to
determine
whether
the
individuals
before
him
do
or
don't
believe
in
god.
otherwise,
their
--
you'd
perhaps
it
has
some
additional
qualification.
but
even
if
you
get
beyond
that
question
and
--
and
again
respective
to
it,
an
equal
protection
argument,
divorced
of
the
first
amendment
question
on
a
rational
basis,
how
do
you
know
that
a
person
doesn't
believe
in
god?
because
he
says
so,
because
he
said
so,
so
you
believe
him
when
he
says,
he
doesn't
believe
in
god,
but
then
according
to
this,
you
refuse
to
believe
him
when
he
says
he's
going
to
perform
his
office
in
a
true
and
diligent
fashion
or
when
he
says
he's
going
to
support
the
constitution?
you
believe
him
with
respect
to
disqualifying
him,
but
you
don't
believe
him
because
he's
going
to
--
because
he's
--
has
to
promise
that
he's
going
to
perform
the
office
as
he
should.
there's
a
good
argument
that
also
as
to
why
you
should
believe
a
nonbeliever
even
more
than
a
believer.
if
--
if
this
provision
is
a
good
one,
because
the
nonbeliever
is
suffering
disadvantages.
he
suffers
public
program.
he's
barred
from
public
office
and
in
this
context
the
words,
“i
believe
in
god,”
are
--
are
something
that
--
that
he's
offering
almost
as
a
--
accepting
as
a
bribe
from
the
state.
if
he
says
these
words,
he
gets
the
public
office,
if
he
doesn't,
he
doesn't
get
the
public
office.
so
what
good
are
the
words
whether
it's
to
his
advantage
to
say
them?
chief
justice
ellsworth
in
england
once
in
--
in
this
country,
once
referred
to
england
where
they
had
a
test
oath
at
the
time
he
pointed
to
it
and
--
and
in
contrast
to
connecticut,
where
they
didn't
have
one.
because
in
england
every
person
that
holds
a
public
office
must
either
be
a
saint
by
law
or
a
hypocrite
by
practice.
i
think
that
at
one
time,
mr.
justice
black,
you
yourself
said
that
words
under
--
uttered
under
compulsion
or
proof
of
nothing
but
loyalty
to
self-
interest.
and
i
think
the
same
thing
would
apply
here
that
where
a
person
says
words
under
compulsion,
“i
believe
in
god,”
or
whatever
else
he
says
under
a
form
of
compulsion
such
as
this,
it
proves
nothing
other
than
his
own
self-interest
is
--
is
at
stake.
this
is
not
a
reasonable
classification,
it
seems
to
me.
now,
what
if
the
state
finds
that
someone
falsely
took
the
oath
and
then
we
get
into
another
problem?
that
if
he
took
the
oath
and
didn't
really
believe
in
god
then
we
have
a
heresy
file
set
up.
in
which
perhaps
according
to
the
law
of
maryland,
he's
even
incompetent
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf,
because
witnesses
are
barred
not
only
by,
unless
they
believe
in
god,
but
there
are
additional
disqualifications
in
believing
in
a
system
of
rewards
and
punishment
and
the
moral
sanctity
of
an
oath.
now
it's
our
contention
that
--
that
such
a
provision
is
this
with
the
first
amendment
and
without
the
first
amendment,
has
no
reasonable
basis
for
qualifying
a
person
for
public
office.
i
go
on
to
the
article
vi
argument
--
yes
--
mr.
lawrence
speiser
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
--
there's
article
that
--
all
right.
that
there
--
there's
article
39,
as
i
recall,
which
--
which
provides
that
--
article
36
which
says
this,
“nor
shall
any
person
otherwise
competent
be
deemed
incompetent
as
a
witness
or
juror
on
account
of
his
religious
beliefs
provided,
he
believes
in
the
existence
of
god
and
that
under
his
dispensation,
such
person
will
be
held
morally
accountable
for
his
acts
and
be
rewarded
or
punished
therefore,
either
in
this
world
or
in
the
world
that
come.”
those
are
all
qualifications
to
be
a
witness
or
juror
in
maryland.
mr.
lawrence
speiser
well,
i
think
that
if
he
were
barred,
it
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process,
but
there's
no
exclusion
here.
it
says
witness
or
juror.
there's
no
exclusion.
now,
on
the
article
vi
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
which
you
raised
as
to
whether
it's
properly
before
the
court,
we
refer
to
it
in
our
reply
brief.
article
vi
was
mentioned
specifically
in
the
complaint
for
mandamus.
it
was
covered
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
covered
there
rather
than
in
the
chief
--
in
the
brief
in
chief
because,
the
chief
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
asked
that
there
be
no
duplication
when
he
granted
permission
to
file
amicus
briefs.
so
it
was
covered
in
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
it
has
been
raised
both
in
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
as
well.
now,
we
will
concede
that
article
vi
in
and
of
itself,
does
not
apply
directly
to
the
states
without
implementation
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
liberty
clause,
“that
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.”
the
argument
is
setout
in
our
briefs.
we
feel
that
considering
the
discussion
in
the
--
on
the
constitutional
convention
that
they
considered
religious
test
so
fundamental.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
even
a
broader
provision,
first
suggested
for
inclusion
of
the
constitution.
they
finally
faded
away
back
to
this,
but
this
was
so
--
so
fundamental,
they
included
that
on
the
constitution.
it's
the
only
thing
in
our
constitution
covering
freedom
of
religion,
then
you
added
the
first
amendment.
so
it
can
be
considered
to
apply
against
the
states
now.
i
--
i
can
see
that
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
can
have
a
different
rules
covering
religious
tests
for
public
office
in
the
federal
government
as
against
the
state.
it
can
apply
either
because
it's
considered
a
fundamental
part
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
of
religion,
the
establishment
of
religion,
or
it
can
be
considered
merely
by
an
article
vi
being
incorporated
in
the
liberty
clause,
that
--
that
no
person
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
directly.
