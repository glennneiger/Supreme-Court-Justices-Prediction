mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
pleases.
the
--
this
case
presents
one
single
issue.
it
is
whether
a
state
may,
consistently
with
the
federal
constitution,
bar
from
public
office
a
person
who
cannot
conscientiously
declare
that
he
believes
in
the
existence
of
god.
we
contend
that
a
state
cannot
do
so
on
four
separate
grounds.
we
believe
such
a
requirement
constitutes
a
law
respecting
the
establishment
of
religion
within
the
prohibition
of
the
first
amendment
as
that
prohibition
is
made
applicable
to
the
state
at
the
fourteenth.
we
believe
that
it
constitutes
a
law
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
also
as
made
applicable
to
the
states
at
the
fourteenth.
we
suggest
that
it
constitutes
to
the
appellant
here
to
other
similarly
situated,
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
the
deprivation
of
liberty
without
due
process
and
finally,
we
suggest
that
the
ban
of
article
vi
with
respect
to
religious
test
for
office,
may
be
applicable
to
the
states
as
well
as
to
the
federal
government.
i
shall
undertake
to
discuss
the
first
two
contentions
and
i
shall
leave
it
to
my
colleague
mr.
speiser
to
discuss
the
latter
two.
in
respect
to
the
ban
on
establishment
of
religion,
what
exactly
that
means
has
been
subject
to
interpretation
by
this
court
in
several
cases.
and
at
the
very
least,
i
think
there
is
no
dispute.
that
means
that
government,
federal
or
states
may
not
prefer
one
or
more
religion
over
other
religions.
it's
our
contention
that
a
law
which
requires
an
expression
of
belief
in
the
existence
of
god
is
a
(inaudible)
refers
theistic
religions
over
non-theistic
religions.
while
suppose
it's
not
--
it's
not
the
common
impression,
yet
it
is
true
that
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
god
is
not
an
indispensable
aspect
of
religion,
as
there
are
many
religions,
but
religions
which
have
adherence
in
a
hundreds
of
millions
in
which
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
god
is
not
a
necessary
aspect.
for
example,
the
buddhist
religion,
the
confucian
religion,
perhaps
50
years
ago
or
75
years
ago,
100
years
ago,
that
might
not
have
been
particularly
significant
for
the
united
states,
today,
it
certainly
is.
the
admission
of
a
state
like
hawaii
to
the
union,
which
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
buddhists
as
well
as
buddhists
in
the
continental
united
states,
i
think
this
is
a
factor
which
must
always
be
considered
in
defining
religion.
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
so.
this
is
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
this
is
necessarily
so.
i
think
there's
a
common
impression.
but
if
we
were
to
accept
that,
we
would
have
to
exclude
from
the
compass
of
religion,
the
literally
hundreds
of
millions
of
persons
who
are
of
the
buddhist
faith
or
the
confucius
faiths,
as
well
as
the
hundreds
of
thousands
who
are
members
of
the
ethical
culture
society
in
the
united
states
which
the
circuit
court
--
i
mean
this
district
has
declared
it
to
be
a
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
it
wouldn't
exclude
them.
they
do
believe
in
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
the
ballard
case.
yes,
they
do
believe
in
that.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
[laughter]
i
--
i
believe
in
themselves,
too.
but
i
think
there
are
many
humanists
to
whom
--
who
would
insist
that
they
are
a
religious
group
and
to
them
the
supreme
obligation
of
religion
is
the
ethics
of
mass
relationship
to
man
rather
a
man's
relationship
to
a
god
or
gods.
i
would
certainly
believe
that
at
least
in
concepts
of
the
middle
of
the
20th
century,
a
court
should
no
be
prepared
to
exclude
from
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
those
whose
religious
motivations
do
not
encompass
the
belief
in
some
supernatural
being.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
think
we
have,
in
our
brief,
indicated,
i
think,
what
we
believe
to
be
out
of
the
substance
to
substantiate
our
contention.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
perhaps
(inaudible).
now,
if
--
if
the
first
amendment
bars
a
state
from
preferring
a
particular
religion
of
other
religions,
even
if
it's
an
orthodox,
a
generally
accepted
religion.
and
if,
as
i
suggest,
the
concept
of
the
term
“religion”,
as
used
in
the
first
amendment,
does
not
exclude
non-theistic
religions,
then
i
think
it
follows
clearly
at
this
particular
requirement
of
the
state
of
maryland,
as
well
as
other
states,
is
a
preference
of
certain
religions
over
others.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
is
so.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
to
return
for
quite
a
moment
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
regarding
the
inclusion
of
non-theistic
belief
in
the
scope
of
the
term
"religion".
i
think
this
case
illustrates
very
well
the
growing
--
the
expanding
interpretation
of
the
term
"religion".
originally,
the
state
of
maryland
required
that
all
its
public
officers
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
sir.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it
includes
--
it
includes
--
yes,
that's
part
of
my
argument.
it
includes
certainly
non-theism.
at
the
present
time,
i'm
asserting
that
it
includes
non-theism.
i
will
shortly
assert
that
it
includes
atheism
as
well,
but
as
of
now,
i
am
asserting
that
it
includes
non-theism
which
is
not
necessarily
atheism.
now,
originally,
the
maryland
law
required
the
declaration
of
belief
in
the
christian
religion.
this
was
--
their
initial
form
in
1776.
in
the
middle
of
19th
century,
about
1850,
as
a
result
of
a
good
deal
of
agitation
that
passed,
it
was
known
as
the
jewish
law,
which
permitted
a
person
who
was
of
the
jewish
faith
to
take
the
oath
even
though
he
did
not
believe
in
the
christian
religion.
he
will
stand
that
he
should
--
if
he
is
a
jew,
the
law
said,
“he
can't
profess
a
belief
in
the
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments.”
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a
--
a
belief
in
the
future
state
of
rewards
and
--
and
punishments.
if
he
professes
to
be
a
jew,
that
was
the
exact
language,
but
if
he
professes
to
be
a
jew,
he
may
declare
a
belief
in
the
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments.
these
brought
in
all
christians
presumably
and
all
jews
or
at
least,
those
jews
who
professed
their
belief
in
the
future
state
of
rewards
and
punishments.
it
excluded
moslems
or
others
who
were
neither
christians
nor
jews,
then
came
the
present
law
which
requires
simply
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
--
of
a
god.
so
that
the
term
"religion"
has
been
expanded
originally
on
christian
to
jew,
to
perhaps
moslem
or
--
or
--
and
now,
i
am
suggesting
to
the
--
your
honor
that
within
the
constitution,
it
must
include
all
those
who
are
of
a
religion
whether
or
not,
that
religion
encompasses
or
requires
a
belief
in
the
existence
of
god.
i
suggest
too
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
first
amendment,
it
was
--
as
it
interpreted
by
this
court
as
barring
preferential
aid
to
religion,
barring
from
public
office
of
others
who
are
not
within
the
religious
groups
constitutes
preferential
aid.
various
cases
of
this
court
have
interpreted
preferential
aid
to
encompass,
for
example,
permission
to
use
public
parks
which
are
barred
to
other
religions,
like
fowler
against
rhode
island
or
the
permission
to
use
public
--
schools
for
religious
teachings
or
perhaps
tax
benefits.
certainly,
i
think
that
a
statutory
requirement
excluding
from
public
office,
all
those
except
in
the
preferred
groups,
constitutes
preferential
aid
to
religion
within
the
compass
and
meaning
of
the
first
amendment's
no
establishment
clause.
i
should
like
to
go
further
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
contend
that
the
--
this
would
apply
equally
to
individuals.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
exactly
what
my
second
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
this
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
non-belief
would
not
be
a
religion,
in
the
sense
of
preferential
aid
to
particular
religion
over
other
religions.
it
would
however
be
within
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
surprisingly
enough,
i
think
the
free
exercise
clause
as
it
was
understood
by
the
--
the
fathers
of
our
constitution
encompass
those
without
religion.
and
i
think
perhaps
the
best
illustration
of
that,
i
have
some
several
of
my
brief,
but
i
just
like
to
read
this
one
brief
sentence
from
the
language
of
mr.
james
iredell
who
thereafter,
became
a
justice
of
this
court.
and
he
said,
in
discussing
in
the
constitutional
--
in
the
--
north
carolina
convention
on
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
he
met
the
argument
that
the
article
vi
appeared
to
allow
those
without
religion
to
become
president
of
the
united
states
or
to
hold
office.
and
he
says
as
follows,
“but
as
objected
that
the
people
of
america
may
perhaps,
choose
representatives
who
have
no
religion
at
all
and
that
pagans
and
mohammedans
may
be
admitted
to
--
into
office.”
then
he
says
"but
how
was
it
possible
to
exclude
any
set
of
men,
without
taking
away
that
principle
of
religious
freedom,
which
we
ourselves
so
warmly
contend
for?"
his
--
his
understanding
of
the
principle
of
religious
freedom
encompasses
those
having
no
religion
at
all.
and
therefore,
it's
quite
clear
that
he
did,
and
that
there
were
many
others
too,
i
think
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion,
as
set
forth
in
my
brief,
could
those
discussions
both
in
the
constitutional
convention
itself
and
the
state
legislatures
and
the
state
conventions
as
to
the
first,
the
failure
to
mention
"god"
in
the
constitution
and
second,
the
opening
up
--
the
federal
office
or
government
law
office
to
those
who
do
not
believe
in
god
by
article
vi.
and
a
clear
understanding
of
everybody
there,
at
least
it
was
undisputed
that
encompassed
within
the
protection
of
article
vi,
this
was
before
the
first
amendment,
encompassed
within
the
protection
of
article
vi
are
those
who
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of
god
and
who
have
in
the
words
of
iredell,
"no
religion
at
all."
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
it
was
necessary
and
i
do
not
contend
that
atheism
is
a
religion.
i'm
contending
only
and
i
think
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
constitutional
provisions
against
laws
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
for
having
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
encompassed
the
atheist.
i
have
suggested
that's
a
ban
on
establishment,
encompass
a
non-theist.
i'm
prepared
now
to
go
one
step
further
and
assert
that
it
encompasses
as
well,
those
who
disbelieve,
actively
deny
the
existence
of
a
supreme
--
of
a
god.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
i
agree
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i
would
agree
with
that.
it's
--
[laughter]
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i'll
agree
to
the
extent
that
leaving
aside
the
applicability
of
article
vi,
i
would
say
that
--
that
which
the
constitution
forbids
a
federal
government
under
the
first
amendment,
i
think
under
the
fourteenth,
it
equally
forbids
a
state,
whether
we
say
that
makes
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
except
for
reserving
for
the
moment
the
applicability
of
article
vi.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
reserving
that
for
a
moment
i
would
say
that
there
was
nothing
outside
the
fourteenth
amendment,
except
insofar
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
encompasses
the
first,
nothing
outside
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
would
bar
a
state
from
imposing
a
religious
test
of
any
kind.
now,
my
--
i
suggest
that
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
as
--
as
made
applicable
to
the
state
by
the
fourteenth,
includes
within
its
protection
those
who
affirmatively
disbelieve
in
the
existence
of
a
supreme
being.
i
think
that
the
--
the
discussions
which
surrounded
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
the
--
particularly
the
article
vi
in
the
failure
to
mention
god,
indicates
that
--
that
this
wasn't
in
the
mind
of
the
fathers
of
our
constitution.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
if
--
with
your
permission,
to
leave
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
this
argument
to
my
associate
who
was
discussing
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
that
--
that
aspect
of
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
now,
i
want
to
say
that
were
it
not
for
some
language
in
zorach
against
clauson,
decided
by
this
court
in
1952.
specifically,
the
statement
that
we
are
a
religious
people
whose
institutions
presuppose
a
supreme
being,
from
which
both
the
court
below
and
the
state
of
maryland
in
its
brief,
rely
heavily.
or
if
not
for
that
statement,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
serious
argument
that
the
present
development
of
constitutional
law
on
the
field
of
religious
validity
in
the
first
amendment,
encompasses
within
this
protection,
the
antitheist
not
merely
the
non-theist,
the
antitheist,
whether
we
accept
it
as
part
of
the
establishment,
for
the
free
exercise
or
even
perhaps
as
mr.
justice
jackson
suggested
at
one
time,
the
freedom
of
speech
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
provision.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
beg
your
pardon?
i
said
were
it
not
for
the
--
the
statement
in
zorach
against
clauson,
that
we
are
a
religious
people
whose
institutions
presupposes
supreme
being,
i
think
it
would
not
be
seriously
contended
that
the
atheist
is
outside
the
scope
and
ample
protection
of
the
bill
of
the
rights.
this
language,
whatever
it
means,
i
do
not
think
can
be
interpreted
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
seeks
to
interpret
it
and
as
the
state
of
maryland's
brief
seeks
to
interpret
it,
cannot
be
interpreted
to
mean
to
authorize
government
or
federal
law
state,
to
compel
a
belief
in
a
supreme
being
as
a
prerequisite
for
government
or
office.
were
it
so
--
were
it
so,
it
would
be
directly
contradicted
by
article
vi,
which
specifically
prohibits
such
a
test
of
--
of
oath
in
respect
at
least,
to
the
federal
government.
now,
i
think
the
whole
history
of
establishments
both
in
great
britain
and
the
united
states
indicates
quite
clearly
that
a
bar
--
a
test
for
--
religious
test
for
office,
was
an
inexplicable
element
of
what
is
meant
by
an
establishment
of
religion.
the
--
every
established
religion
had
--
if
it
had
nothing
else,
had
two
factors.
one,
compulsory
support
of
the
so-called
established
religion
whatever
it
is,
also
important
to
taxation.
and
second,
either
barring
those
not
of
the
particularly
favored
religion
or
at
least
giving
preference
to
those
of
the
favored
religion
in
respect
to
public
office.
the
qualification
of
adherence
to
religion
as
a
qualification
of
public
office
is
the
inescapable
stamp
of
establishment
of
religion.
and
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
when
the
arguments
in
the
state
constitutional
conventions
regarding
the
article
vi
took
place,
the
basis
for
the
defense
of
that
provision
was
that
the
jurisdiction
of
secular
government,
the
private
government,
the
political
government
under
our
constitution,
must
be
limited
to
the
secular
purposes
set
forth
from
the
preamble.
that
the
government
has
no
jurisdiction
--
these
are
--
master
of
phraseology.
it
has
no
jurisdiction
in
the
matters
of
religion.
and
therefore,
it
cannot
determine
public
office
on
the
basis
of
belief
or
non-belief.
it
is
its
--
it
has
anyone's
active
government
in
the
united
states
which
i
think
marks
the
end
of
establishments,
it
was
the
virginia
statute
of
religious
liberty
enacted
in
1786,
upon
which
the
first
amendment
of
this
constitution
was
based
as
this
court
has
said.
and
i
think
it
is
highly
significant
that
the
virginia
statute
of
religious
liberty
proscribed
as
aspects
of
establishment,
which
it
was
destroyed
to
--
to
--
two
powers
of
government,
one,
the
power
to
compel
monetary
taxation
for
religion.
the
other's
the
power
to
disbar
from
government
law
office
those
not
within
the
favored
religion.
and
i
will
just
take
this
one
moment
to
read
from
this
great
statute.“therefore,
just
as
the
proscribing
of
any
citizen
as
unworthy
of
public
confidence
by
laying
upon
him
an
incapacity
of
being
called
to
offices
of
trust
and
emolument,
unless
he
professed
or
renounced
this
or
that
religious
opinion
in
depriving
him
injuriously
of
those
privileges
and
advantages
to
which
in
common
with
his
fellow
students
--
fellow
citizens
he
has
a
natural
right.”
this
is
the
preamble.
then
the
upward
section
read
as
follows,
“no
man
shall
be
enforced,
restrained,
molested
or
burdened
in
his
body
or
goods,
nor
shall
otherwise
suffer
on
account
of
his
religious
opinions
or
belief,
but
that
all
men
shall
be
free
to
profess
and
by
argument
to
maintain
their
opinion
in
mass
religion.
and
that
the
same
shall
in
no
way
diminish,
enlarge
or
affect
their
civil
capacities.”
this
is
what
we
are
urging
here.
we
are
urging
that
the
state
of
maryland
cannot
use
the
beliefs
--
religious
beliefs
to
enlarge
all
prejudice
or
diminish
in
any
ways,
civil
capacities.
now,
we
also
urge
and
this
is
inextricably
connected
with
the
first
ground,
that
a
law
requiring
belief
in
god
has
a
condition
for
serving
public
office,
consonant
to
a
law
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
i've
already
suggested
that
the
first
amendment
and
the
free
exercise
as
well
as
in
the
establishment
provision,
encompasses
non-religion,
non-theistic
religion
as
well
as
religion,
the
court
need
not
go
any
further
than
that.
if
wishes
to,
i
would
go
further
and
says
--
say
it
encompasses
the
denial
of
the
existence
of
a
god
as
well.
the
state
of
maryland
argues
and
it's
been
argued
by
the
court
of
appeals
below.
first
that
(inaudible)
in
the
argument
that
the
first
amendment
protects
freedom
of
religion,
not
freedom
from
religion,
i
do
not
think
this
is
an
accurate
understanding
of
what
the
first
amendment
was
intended
to
protect.
but
more
important,
the
state
suggests
that
there
is
no
infringement
upon
free
exercise
of
religion.
mr.
torcaso
says
this
--
court
below
in
the
state
of
maryland,
can
believe
or
disbelieve
anything
he
wants.
he
has
a
right,
any
kind
of
right
to
believe
whatever
he
wants,
but
he
cannot
be
a
notary
public
or
other
public
official
in
the
state
of
maryland,
unless
he
declares
a
belief
in
god.
and
the
denial
or
withholding
from
him
of
his
privilege
to
serve
the
state
of
maryland
in
particular
capacity,
does
not
infringe
upon
his
free
exercise
of
religion.
i
think
that
this
is
not
correct.
i
think
that
the
withholding
of
the
right
or
privilege,
i
don't
think
it's
important
why
it's
called,
the
holding
of
--
the
withholding
of
the
right
of
privilege
to
serve
the
government
constitutes
an
impediment
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion
if
that
grant
or
denial
is
conditioned
upon
the
acceptance
or
rejection
of
any
particular
religious
belief.
i
think
there
are
quite
a
number
of
cases,
it
set
forth
in
our
brief,
which
indicates
that
the
concept
of
free
exercise
of
religion
goes
much
beyond
putting
a
man
in
jail,
if
he
does
not
profess
a
particular
religious
belief
or
if
he
professes
a
contrary
religious
belief
that
the
sanction
of
barring
from
public
office
constitutes
an
impairment
or
an
infringement
upon
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
i
think
it's
important
also
to
note
that
we
are
concerned
here
not
with
action,
but
with
belief.
the
state
of
maryland
is
not
even
going
too
far,
so
far
to
say
that
anybody
who
openly
--
avows
atheism
or
preaches
atheism
shall
be
barred.
it
demands
that
you
believe
in
the
existence
of
god
and
if
you
don't
believe
in
the
existence
of
god,
you
are
barred
from
serving.
for
the
first
time,
a
state
has
imposed
a
test
in
respect
to
religious
belief.
now,
this
court
has
said
that,
“freedom
of
belief
is
as
absolute
--
at
least
as
absolute
as
any
freedom
can
be.”
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that's
the
first
time
before
this
court,
as
--
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
before
this
court.
that's
what
i
meant,
before
this
court.
that's
the
first
time
before
this
court
--
this
court
has
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
upon
the
absoluteness
of
religious
belief.
i
do
not
think
necessary
for
this
court
to
pass
upon
the
question
of
the
application
of
political
belief
that
presents
different
problems.
i
am
saying
only
that
certainly,
certainly
religious
belief,
religious
belief
where
it
is
not
connected
with
manifest
over
a
conduct.
even
oral
expression,
religious
belief
is
and
must
be
absolute
under
the
first
amendment
as
both
federal
government
and
the
fourteenth
as
encompasses
--
as
it
incorporates
the
first
in
respect
to
the
state
government.
nothing
i
think
could
be
more
fundamental
than
that
in
our
democratic
system.
the
government
has
no
power
to
control
what
man
believed
in
respect
to
the
(inaudible)
or
respect
to
the
supernatural,
in
respect
to
the
deity,
may
or
may
not
determine
what
he
believes
and
whether
we
have
a
right
to
assassinate
the
president
of
the
united
states
or
to
use
labor
unions
for
the
purpose
of
promoting
political
beliefs.
that's
a
different
question,
but
certainly
it
may
not
regulate
belief
or
oppose
a
disqualification,
because
of
--
of
any
belief
one
has
in
respect
to
his
relationship
to
whether
the
gods
may
or
may
not
be.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
duties
of
a
--
of
a
notary
public
in
maryland
is
to
administer
oath
or
declarations.
the
--
and
the
one
who
takes
an
oath
or
declaration
for
a
notary
public
and
found
thereafter
to
lie,
is
subject
to
the
laws
of
perjury.
the
--
these
functions
are
--
the
only
functions
of
a
notary
public,
but
this
power
to
administer
oath
is
not
limited
to
notary
publics.
practically,
i
would
say
the
overwhelming
majority
of
public
officials
above
the
lowest
ministerial
section
--
class
have
power
to
administer
oath.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
it's
not
limited
to
at
all.
it
is
to
any
--
any
office
--
any
public
office
on
the
state
of
maryland.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
you
can
or
you
need
not.
this
is
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
notary
public
need
not.
certainly,
i
--
i
would
very
much
doubt,
indeed,
i
--
almost
certain
to
states
have
no
oath,
would
be
declared
invalid.
because
it
includes
or
excludes
the
term
“so
help
me
god.”
the
--
the
oath
as
prescribed
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
does
not
include
that
phrase
at
all.
many
oaths
--
many
statutes
included
some
(inaudible)
i
think
that's
a
ceremonial
act.
it's
neither
its
presence,
nor
its
absence
in
anyway
affects
the
validity
or
the
effectiveness
of
the
oath.
besides
this,
i
don't
think
it's
anything
in
congress
for
a
person
himself
does
not
believe
in
god
to
administer
an
oath
to
one
who
does
believe
in
god.
certainly,
people
often
swear
on
the
bible,
the
new
testament
and
the
oath
may
be
administered
by
a
jew,
who
does
not
believe
in
the
new
testament,
who
believes
only
in
the
old
testament.
it
is
not
the
--
the
person
administering
the
oath
which
is
the
important
thing
as
the
person
who
is
taking
the
oath.
it
is
his
belief.
if
belief
is
relevant
at
all
and
i
think
under
modern
laws
of
--
of
perjury
and
of
the
competency
of
witnesses,
it
is
--
it
is
not
the
--
the
belief
of
--
any
religious
belief
is
not
relevant
at
all.
but
if
it
is
relevant
at
all,
it
is
the
belief
of
the
taker
of
the
oath,
not
of
the
person
who
administers.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
would
say
no.
i
would
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
believe
that
that
would
be
different,
undoubtedly
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
unconstitutional.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
he
has
the
right
to
--
to
refuse
to
say
that
too.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
think
so,
sir.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
actually
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
actually
the
constitution
uses
the
words
"declare".
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
presumably
he
would
have
a
right
to
declare
his
belief
in
god.
but
he
must
declare
it
whether
he
doesn't
--
the
purpose
of
a
declaration,
the
--
the
privilege
of
declaration
was
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
non-religious,
but
for
the
benefit
of
quakers
and
the
french
whose
religion
prohibit
them
from
swearing.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
they
were
permitted
to
make
the
same
averment
in
the
form
of
a
declaration
rather
than
the
oath.
but
i
don't
believe
--
but
as
before
this
court,
is
whether
the
formal
--
the
formal
way
in
which
the
averment
is
made,
whether
in
the
form
of
an
oath
or
declaration,
but
before
the
court
is
the
power
to
compel
that
averment
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
--
in
that
whatever
form.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i've
--
i've
--
there's
no
limitation
as
far
as
i
know.
any
person
can't
and
wishes
to
affirm
without
stating
the
reasons
why
--
what
motivates
his
desire
to
affirm
encompasses
i
think
every
person.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
as
far
as
i
know,
it's
never
been
interpreted
here.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
kind
of
like,
could
not
say.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh,
i
think
i
would
guess
it's
a
certain
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
certainly
would
guess
it's
at
least
a
half
century
old.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
i
think
this
goes
back
from
the
original
--
from
the
original
constitutional
provision
of
--
that
allows
the
president
and
other
federal
officers
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
whether
that
was,
i
couldn't
say.
i
think
that
in
the
western
states
--
certainly
the
western
states
from
the
very
beginning,
allowed
--
allowed
affirmation
and
declaration
instead
of
oaths.
and
as
the
--
the
incompetence
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
post
civil
war
state.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
and
as
the
incompetence
of
atheists
or
nonbelievers
to
testify
gradually
disappeared
until
it's
practically
now,
generally
conceived
the
obsolete
although
the
state
of
maryland
assumes
it
isn't,
has
that
developed
with
and
inevitably
came
the
necessary
privilege
of
the
affirming
and
declaring
as
in
lieu
of
swearing.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
to
this
one?
i
think
some
seven
or
eight
states.
they're
listed
in
--
in
the
robbery
for
the
attorney
general's
place
at
maryland.
seven
or
eight
states
have
similar
provisions.
i
don't
frankly,
whether
they
were
actually
enforced.
probably
most
--
most
people
simply
signed
the
oath
whether
or
not,
they
believed
in
the
existence
of
god.
and
therefore,
it
hasn't
been
tested
in
courts
until
now.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
at
maryland,
the
--
oh
make
a
declaration?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
couldn't
say
--
i
couldn't
say,
i
would
guess
he
could
because
every
state
as
far
as
i
know,
protects
the
friend
of
the
quakers
whose
--
who
believe
in
god,
but
interpret
the
command,
“thou
shalt
make
--
take
the
name
of
the
lord
in
vain,”
as
prohibiting,
forbidding
oath.
and
therefore,
i'm
sure
that
there
is
no
state
which
would
i
think
will
be
a
denial
to
process
frankly
if
a
state
said
to
a
quaker,
“since
you
can
not
take
an
oath,
you
are
incompetent
as
a
witness.”
i
think
it
will
deny
due
process,
one
who's
--
is
an
atheist
where
barred
from
testifying,
but
certainly
one
who
was
a
quaker
or
a
friend
who
cannot
take
an
oath
because
of
that,
could
not
be
barred
as
a
witness.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
declaration
which
is
in
challenged
here
or
the
declaration
of
the
witness?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
know.
yes
mr.
leo
pfeffer
in
--
in
the
present
case?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
a
declaration
of
belief
in
god.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
the
belief
in
the
existence
of
god.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
well,
it's
a
declaration.
you
could
say,
“i
swear
i
believe
in
god
or
i
declare
i
believe
in
god.”
in
both
case,
you
must
say,
“i
believe
in
god.”
mr.
leo
pfeffer
that
you
can
say,
“i
swear
it.”
mr.
leo
pfeffer
or
“i
believe,”
or
“i
declare
it.”
mr.
leo
pfeffer
either
is
permissible.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
in
both
cases
therewith
--
records
of
belief
in
god
is
the
present.
