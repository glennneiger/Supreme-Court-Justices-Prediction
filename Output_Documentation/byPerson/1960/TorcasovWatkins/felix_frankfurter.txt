justice
felix
frankfurter
just
believe
in
themselves
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
notice
you
don't
quote
--
nobody
gives
the
quote
that
regards
to
these
hands,
disquisition
on
that
subject
in
the
case
called,
what
was
it,
cogen
against
united
states
or
united
states
against
cogen?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
isn't
so.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
that
--
the
(inaudible)
eloquent
statement
of
your
case,
as
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
decide
here
what
--
what
the
content
of
religion
is
or
what
it
isn't?
we've
got
a
very
specific
question
here,
whether
--
whether
maryland
may
require
to
the
notary
public,
taken
oath,
but
we
believe
in
a
deity.
and
therefore,
of
course,
we
must
--
it
--
to
deny
that
right
to
maryland,
it
must
be
predicated
on
something,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
it
can't
be
predicated
on
anything
except
the
fourteenth
amendment,
with
all
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
draws
unto
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
merely
asked
you
whether
you
agree
or
disagree?
i
--
i,
of
course,
couldn't
speak
for
anybody
else,
as
i'm
authorized
when
the
question
is
put
from
the
bench,
it's
not
authorized
except
for
the
individual
to
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
doesn't
contradict
anything
i've
said.
i've
said
i
can
only
find
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
governs
the
state.
you
don't
disagree
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
hold
and
include
the
first.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
when
the
allowance
of
affirming
instead
of
taking
an
oath
came
into
--
of
course,
enacted
or
allowed
the
witnesses
in
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
about
--
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
affirmation
statutes
in
various
states
of
the
modifications
of
the
requirements
of
an
oath?
is
that
a
--
a
movement
contemporaneous
more
or
less,
throughout
the
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
witnesses
in
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
western
states
meaning
post
civil
war
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
states
have
comparable
legislation
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
chase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
nobody
pleads
this?
you
--
the
state
has
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
renewals
automatic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
--
i
know
they
must
be
applied
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
formality?
the
man
has
been
a
notary
for
six
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
can't
reapply
again
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
argument
in
political
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
an
argument
of
political
account?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
this
court
that
--
any
(inaudible)
one
way
or
the
other
that
--
or
renewal
or
renewed
application
will
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
there's
any
indication
in
the
records
that
renewal
of
the
application
would
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kaufman,
the
state
senator
may
refuse
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
or
with
this
reason
to
countersign
this,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
because
he
doesn't
like
the
religion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
can
you
go
--
my
question
is
can
you
--
suppose
he
said,
i
--
i
will
forward
your
application,
can
you
--
can
you
bring
a
mandamus
to
make
him
forwarded
by
alleging
that
he
--
that
he's
having
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
pledge
his
conscience
that
way,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
has
in
it
seats
of
--
potential
seats
of
arbitrariness
even
more
numerous
than
--
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
before
us.
i'm
just
reflecting
[laughter].
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
many
things
that
could
be
done
through
silence
which
--
for
which
you
can't
give
a
bad
reason,
isn't
that
true?
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
today.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
--
may
i
suggest
that
one
can
think
of
this
(inaudible)
that
you
have
in
furthermore,
free-spirited
people
beginning
with
luther
martin.
but
the
lawyer
might
say
or
the
senator
might
say,
well,
chief
justice's
rule
may
like
concur
in
the
result,
he
must
have
had
some
doubts.
the
supreme
court
took
the
case
and
heard
the
argument
which
may
go
still
a
contestable
question
and
i
--
of
(inaudible)
that's
perfectly
imagined
belief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
saying
you
made
it.
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suggesting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
had
a
case
like
this
that
an
appointed
question
of
other
--
something
rather
(inaudible)
in
which
under
this
discrimination
because
of
color
or
before
the
courts
and
the
--
the
election
was
imminent
of
--
had
in
fact
expired
by
the
--
has
been
taking
place
by
(inaudible)
and
this
court
says
â€œwe
can."
this
is
an
non-billable
office,
a
non
(inaudible)
office.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
it
say,
mr.
kaufman?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
it
is
a
legal
doctrine,
but
we
are
religious
people
presumably,
religious
people
can
--
can
take
measures
to
sustain
the
presupposition
of
their
society,
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
i
do
[laughter]
what
i
said,
but
it
--
it
is
not
with
that
presupposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
does
a
lot
of
talk
in
--
in
cases
and
opinion
to
this
court
which
have
to
be
looked
at
(inaudible)
that
hard,
if
you
were
to
take
it
literally,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
opinions
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
that
at
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
religous
