roy
r.
torcaso,
appellant,
versus
clayton
k.
watkins,
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
for
montgomery
county,
maryland.
mr.
pfeffer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pfeffer,
how
about
the
argument
of
--
of
the
state
that
the
sixth
amendment
argument
is
not
open
here,
because
you
abandoned
it
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
expressively
said
that
it
was
not
dealing
with
that
section.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
perfectly
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why
--
could
i
ask,
mr.
pfeffer,
before
he
sits
down
please.
could
a
witness
be
compelled
to
say
--
to
respond
to
that
portion
of
a
note
which
says,
“so
help
me
god”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well,
that's
--
i
--
i
misunderstood
you.
now,
how
about
the
portion
of
this
oath
that
says,
“in
the
presence
of
god”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
he
has
a
right
to
refuse
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
refuse
to
say
that.
now,
is
there
any
statute
in
maryland
that
gives
him
the
right
to
affirm
instead
of
making
this
kind
of
a
--
of
a
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now
may
i
ask
you
do
we
--
give
me
just
one
moment.
may
i
ask
just
one
more
question?
does
--
does
an
affirmation
as
used
in
the
united
states
statutes
refer
only
to
a
person
who
does
believe
in
god
or
does
--
does
it
apply
to
all
people
who
do
not
wish
to
take
an
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
never
been
interpreted
as
far
as
you
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
can
a
--
can
a
witness
or
--
or
a
person
who
is
under
obligation
to
take
an
oath
always
make
a
declaration
in
--
in
maryland
instead
of
taking
the
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
in
mind
the
declaration
as
required
in
maryland?
does
it
make
any
reference
to
--
to
god
or
the
declaration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
you
--
as
i
understood
you,
a
person
could
make
a
declaration
in
--
instead
of
bringing
his
oath.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
is
a
declaration
called
for?
it
does
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
this
--
this
isn't
a
declaration.
this
is
an
oath.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
there
was
an
alternative
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
in
--
in
maryland
that
they
called
an
affirmation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
i
--
i
see
--
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
speiser.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
they
permit
in
england
as
the
equivalent
of
the
oath?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
just
to
say
that
they
will
tell
the
truth
or
they
will
do
so
and
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
without
any
reference
to
the
deity
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
says,
“in
the
presence
of
god.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
finan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
that
--
what
is
that
law
review
job?
chief
justice
earl
warren
university
of
virginia.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
a
buddhist
--
could
a
buddhist
become
a
notary
public
in
maryland?
a
buddhist?
as
i
understand,
buddhists
do
not
believe
in
a
--
in
a
god.
yet
they
are
many
in
this
--
in
this
country
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
particularly
in
hawaii
as
counsel
has
mentioned
and
i
know
in
other
states,
they
have
many
buddhist
temples
of
which
citizens
are
members.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yet
it
is
recognized
as
one
of
the
religions
of
the
world,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
--
what
basis
in
the
constitution
is
therefore
excluding
those
people,
if
they
have
a
religious
belief
and
want
to
practice
it
in
the
--
in
this
country?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
think
that
this
oath
required
a
belief
in
christian
religion
that
it
would
be
sustainable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i'm
not
so
concerned
the
moment
about
the
atheist
as
i
am,
say
some
other
importance
of
religion
like
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
like
the
buddhist.
and
some
of
rest
of
them
and
i
--
i
thought
that
we
got
away
from
--
if
you
conceded
that
it
couldn't
be
--
it
was
too
restrictive,
if
it
was
a
christian
religion,
i'm
wondering
how
you
could
differentiate
between
the
others.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
--
may
i
ask,
is
it
clear
in
this
case
that
--
that
this
man
is
an
atheist
as
distinguished
from
a
non-believer
or
such
as
an
agnostic
or
--
or
let
us
say,
some
other
religion,
is
it
fair
in
the
record
that
--
that
he
is
an
atheist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
that's
enough
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
your
court
then
put
any
gloss
on
this
as
to
--
to
whether
it
would
apply
only
to
--
to
atheist
as
distinguished
from
agnostics
or
--
or
rather
religious
beliefs
that
did
not
necessarily
recognize
a
supreme
being?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
treat
them
all
the
same
so
far
as
the
--
the
interpretation
of
the
courts
is
concerned
--
the
courts
are
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
think
this
case
here
is
not
just
as
though
he's
an
atheist,
but
as
you
--
as
if
he
was
anyone
who
wouldn't
--
not
for
any
reason
to
take
the
oath.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
the
ungodly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kaufman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
limitation
on
the
number
of
notaryships
that
can
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
political
consideration?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
must
come
through
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
question
you
asked?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
--
if
we
should
even
decide
this
case
next
monday
under
maryland
law
if
you
state
to
us
that
there
would
be
no
appointment
to
fill?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we've
decided
it
in
favor
of
the
--
of
the
appellant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
--
suppose
it
was
issued
after
monday,
under
maryland
law.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
what
i
was
asking.
it
seems
strange
you
wouldn't
present
that
to
the
court
before
this
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kaufman,
you
--
you
mentioned
the
everson
case
a
few
moments
ago.
but,
what
would
you
do
with
--
with
this
language
where
it
says
in
that
case,
“on
the
other
hand,
other
language
of
the
first
amendment
commands
that
new
jersey
cannot
pamper
its
citizens
in
the
free
exercise
of
their
own
religion?
consequently,
it
cannot
exclude
individual
catholics,
lutherans,
mohammedans,
baptist,
jews,
methodist,
nonbelievers,
presbyterians
or
the
members
of
any
other
faith,
because
of
their
faith
or
lack
of
it
when
receiving
the
benefits
of
public
welfare
legislation.
no
person
can
be
punished
for
entertaining
or
professing
religious
beliefs
or
disbeliefs
for
church
attendants
and
non-attendants.”
well,
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
one
of
the
later
cases
that
you
--
that
you
have
cited
in
your
briefs
concerning
the
religious
character
of
our
--
of
our
government
and
i'm
not
disputing
that
we
are
a
religious
people
or
that
our
government
does
contemplate
a
belief
in
--
in
god,
but
--
but
this
language
in
everson
speaks
of
punishing
a
person
by
refusing
him
the
--
the
benefits
of
welfare
and
legislation,
because
he
doesn't
happen
to
conform
and
this
says
that
he
--
it
cannot
be
done
regardless
of
whether
he
believes
or
disbelieves.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
one
member
of
the
court
asked
if
the
attorney
general
a
few
moments
to
ago,
when
you
deprive
a
man
of
the
right
to
hold
public
office,
such
as
this
or
any
other
office
in
the
state
of
maryland,
because
of
his
religion
for
lack
of
it,
are
you
not
interfering
with
his
liberty
as
an
american
citizen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all
they
were
doing
--
mayor
was
to
say
that
children
were
not
qualified
to
be
in
the
public
schools,
if
they
didn't
take
the
oath.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
not
let
them
attend
--
they
wouldn't
let
them
attend,
if
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
take
the
oath,
isn't
it
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
that
was
because
polygamy
was
a
--
a
crime
under
--
under
the
law,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
no
--
nothing
in
--
in
maryland
that
makes
this
a
crime,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
to
not
believe
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kaufman,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
mootness
was
raised
for
the
first
time,
would
you
mind
giving
us
a
--
a
memorandum
before
friday
with
your
views
concerning
mootness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
to
show
that
you
can,
but
so
we'll
have
it
by
--
by
friday
and
i'll
ask
counsel.
they'll
decide
to
do
the
same
thing,
if
they
will.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
before
friday.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
