justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
a
different
argument,
isn't
it,
to
the
--
what
i
understood
you
were
asked
about
--
i
understood
you
ask,
you
were
claiming
that
--
asserting
that
--
maybe
you
aren't,
that
atheism
is
itself
a
religion,
quite
different
to
say
that
the
idea
of
religious
freedom,
would
leave
a
man
the
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
to
be
religious
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
only
understood
that
i
disagree
with
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
member
of
the
court
believed
that,
doesn't
necessarily
require
you
to
argue
within
that
compass.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
understand
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
you
said
--
you
referred.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
--
are
you
correct
in
that
statement
that
it's
the
first
time
that's
occurred
and
is
to
be
considered?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
mean
before
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask,
what
is
the
basis
of
that
argument
you're
making
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
--
if
you
get
away
from
the
protection
you
claimed
under
the
first
amendment,
how
can
you
say
it
might
not
be
reasonable
if
that's
your
basis
for
a
state
to
say
that
a
notary
public
whose
business
is
to
administer
the
oath
which
contained
statements,
“so
help
me
god,”
that
an
atheist
would
not
be
the
right
man
to
do
that,
if
--
if
you're
depending
wholly
on
equal
protection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
but
now,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
based
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
do
i
understand
that
the
only
--
only
duty
on
this
man
is
to
administer
oaths?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
the
oath
contained
in
the
statement,
“so
help
me
god?”
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
he
has
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
oath
that
he
would
have
to
administer
in
maryland.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
they
also
have
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
might
that
not
if
you're
getting
down
to
nothing
with
equal
protection,
might
not
that
operation
affirms,
or
state
to
say,
“we
do
not
want
a
man
to
be
an
official
when
his
duty
has
imposed
an
oath
that
said,
in
the
presence
of
the
god,
or
have
presence
of
god,
when
he
doesn't
live
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
from
your
argument
that
you
think
it
would
be
all
right,
could
a
federal
government
to
impose
a
test
of
this
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
couldn't
weigh,
could
you,
in
view
of
the
next
to
the
last
sole
article
in
the
constitution
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
says
there
is
no
religious
test
shall
ever
be
required.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
indicated
just
when
this
statute
originated?
when
was
it's
first
time?
when
did
it
first
come
to
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
in
the
law
of
maryland
before
that,
when
it
can't

became
a
state?
justice

black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
people
did
it
bar
from
holding
office
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
it
was

became
a
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking,
i
thought
i'd
read
somewhere.
when
the
--
mr.
carroll
was
representing
maryland,
he
was
disqualified
from
holding
public
office?
justice

black
mr.
carroll,
the
great
carroll
who
--
justice

black
charles
carroll.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice

did
you
take
part
in
the
debates
about
the
religious
qualifications
provision?
justice
hugo

black
luther
martin.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
federal
constitutional
provision.
justice
hugo
l.

i
thought
i've
read
somewhere
where
mr.
carroll
expressed
his
views
very
strongly
in
that
connection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
im
not
talking
about
in
the
convention
list.
justice
hugo
l.
black
im
talking
about
in
the
convention
list
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
too
have
been
barred
from
running
for
attorney
general
on
the
ground
of
your
religion,
would
you
consider
that
abridged
your
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
accept
that
in
your
belief
that
you
had
been
barred
because
of
your
religion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
the
states
show
hostility
to
atheist
without
attempting
to
interfere
with
their
belief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
thought
you
used
the
word
“hostility”
to
religions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
on
balance
here,
you
insisted
that
the
interest
of
the
state
in
having
notary
publics,
you
might
do
no
wrong,
outweighed
the
interest
of
the
--
this
man
and
the
public
and
leaving
him
complete
freedom
to
believe
or
not
to
believe
that
he
saw
fit.
is
that
about
the
way
you
had
weighed
in
the
scale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
been
tested
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
what
term?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
part
of
your
appointed
process
then,
to
be
considered
as
a
part
of
your
appointed
process
for
notary
publics
or
the
senate
on
his
own,
to
send
the
application
to
the
man.
otherwise,
how
is
he
appointed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
applies.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
second
that
--
and
the
second
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume,
if
the
senator
had
found
out
in
the
meantime
that
he'd
gone
over
to
the
other
party
or
maybe
has
been
refused
because
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
didn't
make
it
that
he
wouldn't
like
to
send
it,
would
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
the
state
senator,
after
your
state
was
held
that
he
cannot
hold
this
particular
job
because
he's
an
atheist,
he's
recommending
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
--
is
it
--
isn't
a
question
of
whether
you've
done
--
obey
maryland
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
can
we
assume
or
presume
that
your
state
senator
charged
with
this
important
responsibility
of
making
notary
public
[laughter]
would
fail
to
obey
the
law
of
maryland
and
refuse
to
recommend
the
man
have
said,
he
is
an
atheist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
may
change
the
judgment,
we
may,
if
we
please.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
just
a
judgment
just
as
in
this
particular
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
would
(inaudible)
that's
our
practice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
not
apply
on
the
same
fashion
for
the
first
amendment
that
said
congress
would
make
no
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
that
--
wouldn't
the
same
argument
apply
to
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
will
reference
to
the
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag,
a
happy
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
your
reference
to
the
allegiance
to
the
flag,
a
happy
one
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
i
thought
that
we
held
that
the
children
could
not
be
made
to
do
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
a
matter
of
compulsion
if
you
put
disabilities
on
the
man
who
told
you,
he
doesn't
believe
in
religion,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
what
other
--
what
other
jobs
the
positions
could
be
cut
off
or
affirmed
by
the
state
for
being
an
atheist
in
your
judgment?
how
can
you
stop
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
stop
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
that's
all
you
have
now?
but
what
reason
is
there
to
stop
there,
if
you
have
a
right
to
put
those
disabilities
on
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
--
on
the
thing
is
that
he
can't
be
a
notary
public
because
he
doesn't
believe
in
a
religion.
isn't
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
they're
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
take
it's
the
state's
business
to
find
out
what
people
believe
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
for
one
minority,
why
not
another
minority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
not
just
asking
to
know
you
want
to
be
barred
from
qualifications,
as
i
understood
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
belong
to
--
suppose
he
belonged
to
a
sect,
which
he
claimed
believed
in
god
and
the
state
claimed
it
didn't,
could
they
try
that
out
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
other
words
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
a
unitarian
be
an
officer
in
maryland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
your
state
law
said,
no
protestant
or
catholics,
or
no
jew
either
one,
could
not
hold
public
office,
would
you
say
that
was
putting
in
a
compulsion
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
unreasonable.
i
don't
know
exactly
what
that
means,
but
would
that
be
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
would
that
be
compulsion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
there'd
be
no
compulsions
put
on
him
to
belong
to
what
the
covered
church
was
--
was
decided
with
--
with
any
interest
to
maryland
to
avoid
possible
trouble
that
this
good
citizen
--
only
citizen
to
this
good
church
and
hold
a
--
or
is
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say
he
can't
--
you
say
he
must
belong
to
one
in
order
to
hold
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
has
to
believe
in
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
judges
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
question
i
was
asking
about
compulsion.
suppose
it
said,
no
man,
who's
an
atheist,
can
hold
this
job
with
the
public
and
this
job
to
the
state,
this
job
to
the
federal
government,
this
job
somewhere
else,
or
this
job
over
here
or
this
job
job
over
here.
and
finally,
they
got
quite
a
number.
would
you
say
still
say
there's
no
compulsion
on
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
do
with
the
statement
about
justice
roberts,
i
believe
it
was
in
cantwell,
that
belief
is
invaluable?
the
biggest
government,
the
most
powerful
government
can't
interfere
with
this.
but
we're
not
trying
to
interfere
with
his
belief.
he
can
believe
as
we
said
before
in
anything
he
desires
to
believe
in,
but
the
question
is,
if
he
does
not
believe
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
it's
just
a
small
job,
the
state
had.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it's
a
big
job,
suppose
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
people
of
maryland
have
a
right
to
use
that
judgment
of
what's
reasonable
to
bar
people
from
having
office,
because
they
do
not
believe
in
god?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
think
they
meant
by
grateful
power,
civil
and
religious
liberty?[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
find
anything
in
that
to
support
your
belief
that
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
supported
a
test
oath,
religious
test
oath?
justice
hugo

black
you
concede
you
couldn't
do
that,
don't
you?
