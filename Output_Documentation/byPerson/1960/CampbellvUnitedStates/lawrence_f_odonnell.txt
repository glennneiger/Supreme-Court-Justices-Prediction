mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
mr.
o'donnell.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
devote
my
attention
to
the
following
question.
if
the
government
fails
to
produce
a
prior
written
statement
of
a
government
witness
who
has
testified,
which
statement
qualifies
under
the
jencks
act
because
of
a
government
agent's
destruction
of
said
statement,
ought
the
witness'
testimony
be
stricken
from
the
record.
this,
in
substance,
is
the
question
raised
by
parts
one
and
two
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
face
this
question
but
rather,
dismissed
the
petitioner's
contention
perfunctorily
by
citing
the
palermo
decision
which,
of
course,
dealt
with
a
question
totally
unrelated
to
the
question
i
have
just
posed.
section
(d)
states
that
if
the
u.s.
elects
not
to
comply
with
a
not
up
or
a
producible
statement
under
(b)
and
(c),
then
the
court
shall
strike
the
testimony
of
the
witness
from
the
record.
if
we
look
at
sections
(b)
and
(c),
and
also
(a),
we
say
that
they
refer
to
statements
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states.
the
government
says
that
this
necessarily
means
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
production
is
called
on
and,
in
addition,
claims
that
this
position
is
self-evident.
the
petitioners
do
not
claim
the
halo
of
self-evidence
for
the
government's
position.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
like
to
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that,
of
course,
this
entire
notion
of
destruction
--
alleged
destruction
which
appeal
--
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
government's
brief
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
representing
these
petitioners,
i
don't
embrace
the
notion
of
destruction.
i
think
the
entire
lack
of
production
of
the
statement
runs
in
with
--
i
would
make
the
suggestion
that
they
were
attempting
to
insulate
this
witness
and
that
the
trouble
and
difficulty
surrounding
getting
at
this
statement
was
the
obvious
fact
that
it
had
impeachment
material
in
it.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
but
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
well,
i
--
i'm
not
disagreeing
with
my
associate
but
at
the
same
time,
i'm
not
reluctant
to
say
that
there
may
very
well
have
been
skullduggery.
i
think
there's
a
fair
inference
from
the
record
that
such
tactics
were
employed.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
it
might
be,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
well,
may
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
this
particular
agency,
the
fbi
and
the
little
expression
that
has
crept
into
this
case,
the
word
"knows"
as
though
someone
was
scribbling
in
a
dress
or
a
shopping
list
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
or
a
telephone
number,
this
particular
agency
houses
all
sorts
of
records,
millions,
i
would
bet,
of
fingerprints.
and
i
would
say
that
a
well-paid
fbi
agent,
competent,
out
investigating
a
bank
robbery,
interviewing
an
allegedly
eyewitness
of
said
bank
robbery
wouldn't
long
be
tolerated
if
he
didn't
take
careful
notes
of
what
had
happened.
and
i
might
add
that
when
the
summary
of
the
interview
report
which
has
been
stated
doesn't
come
within
the
purview
of
the
act,
i
had
objected
to
the
fact
when
the
judge
took
that
summary
in
camera
that
in
order
to
make
his
judgment,
he
decided
he
should
show
it
to
the
witness
who
had
just
testified
on
direct
examination,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
also
was
placed
under
cross-examination.
so,
the
very
obvious
thing
to
me,
as
trial
counsel
in
that
courtroom,
was
"gosh!
this
fellow
is
going
to
notice
the
minute
he
looks
at
this
that
it's
not
consonant
what
he
testified
to
on
direct."
i
implore
the
court
to
look
at
the
summary
of
fbi
agent
toomey.
dominic
staula
went
in
that
courtroom
and
identified
three
defendants,
positive
and
partial.
the
summary
of
toomey,
the
fbi
agent,
he
said,
"i
never
saw
a
third
person
in
the
bank."
he
gave
one
description
and
there
was
clearly
impeachment
material
in
that
summary.
it
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
no,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it
wasn't
so
much
that
i
trotted
it
out.
i
put
it
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
i,
as
a
rational
being,
could
take
that
inference
from
the
entire
flavor
of
what's
on
this
record.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
i've
taken
a
position,
may
it
please
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
no.
may
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
when
the
premise
you
established
for
a
judgment
exercised
asking
"would
you
consider
that
there
might
have
been
good
faith
or
bad
faith?"
are
now
--
i
would
say,
and
my
argument
develops,
that
it's
(inaudible)
of
no
consequence
whether
it
was
good
faith,
bad
faith,
indifference,
whim,
caprice
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
alright,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
know
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
may
it
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
that's
precisely
my
point.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
may
i
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
in
this
case,
where
the
government
has
come
here
before
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
introduced
a
transcript
that
wasn't
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
wasn't
in
the
trial
court,
i'll
take
this
position.
we
filed
affidavit
of
--
affidavits
of
bias
in
this
case.
i
can't
just
--
i
don't
like
to
raise
and
the
--
we
asked
for
severance
in
this
case
as
against
including
these
three
defendants.
it
was
denied.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
is
talking
about,
well,
if
there's
reversible
error,
it
might
apply
to
one
and
not
to
the
other.
well,
i
say
that's
a
late
date
and
the
--
going
further
on
the
concurring
opinion
of
the
palermo
case,
it
was
said
congress
made
crystal
clear
its
purpose
only
to
check
extravagant
interpretations
of
jencks
while
reaffirming
the
basic
holding
that
the
defendant
in
trial
be
entitled
to
statements
helpful
in
cross-examination
of
government
witnesses
who
testify
against
him.
petitioner
submit
that
"entitled"
means
to
have
a
right
to
and
if
the
petitioners
have
a
right,
then
the
government
has
a
corresponding
obligation
to
comply
with
that
right.
if
there
is
no
obligation,
there
is
no
right.
now,
if
this
obligation
can
be
abrogated
by
the
mere
act
of
an
investigative
agent
destroying
a
statement,
even
if
in
good
faith,
then
the
right
is,
in
reality,
no
right
at
all.
if
the
principles
set
forth
in
the
jencks
case
are
subject
to
whims,
caprice
or
even
negligence
and
carelessness
of
government
agents,
then
the
spirit
of
jencks
is
dead
and
we
are
left
with
the
clops.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
may
it
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
the
fbi
agent?
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
now,
i
say
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
that
there
had
never
been
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
mr.
justice,
yes.
we
don't
contend
that
there
had
ever
been
a
--
a
written
statement
by
witness
staula
but
we
do
contend
that
we
laid
a
foundation
for
a
producible
statement
under
the
various
facilities
set
out
in
the
jencks
act.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
it
was
written
by
the
agent
and
adopted
by
the
--
the
government
witness,
dominic
staula.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
no,
we've
never
made
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
government
contends,
as
it's
been
brought
up,
since
the
petitioners
did
not
attempt
to
call
the
agent
who
took
the
statement,
there
was
no
reason
to
strike
the
testimony.
this
is
the
most
tenuous
of
the
government's
contentions.
petitioners
had
a
right
to
the
statement
signed
and
adopted
by
the
witness
and
to
say
that
the
testimony
of
the
agent
was
a
sufficient
surrogate
is
to
ask
this
court
to
take
up
precedence
in
the
fragile
house
of
mechanical
jurisprudence.
to
attempt
to
equate
the
written
statement
of
the
witness,
given
a
short
time
after
the
robbery
with
the
memory
of
a
government
agent
months
later,
is
to
engage
in
a
flagrantly
vacuous
pleading
and
it's
to
proceed
as
if
the
jencks
decision
had
never
been
handed
down
and
as
if
the
jencks
statute
never
became
law.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
--
the
particular
witness
that
we're
talking
about,
staula,
on
the
stand,
made
a
statement
in
answer
to
the
trial
court
that
this
caption
"fbi
agent
interview
report,"
he
said
it
was
inaccurate
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
--
from
this
particular
witness.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
they
--
he
said
there
were
things
turned
around,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
i
would
qualify
that,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
as
that
colloquy
indicates
that
he
had
doubts
as
to
his
signature,
merely
his
signature.
previously,
on
three
occasions,
he
went
into
the
foundation.
i
can
recall
when
asking
them
the
questions
to
establish
a
foundation,
i
held
in
my
hand
the
public
document
setting
out
the
jencks
act
in
an
attempt
to
relate
the
questions
that
would
satisfy
the
demand
for
producible
statement.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
but
i'd
say,
in
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
the
government
brief,
they
cite
a
--
a
relevant
hypothesis.
they
talk
about
a
statement
being
burned
but
we're
not
dealing
with
an
act
of
god
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
and
i
would
say
that
the
government
adopts
the
petitioners'
contentions.
of
course,
it
would
just
notice
on
government
agencies
that
they
shall
take
care,
especially
when
we
think
of
the
multitudeness
record
year
in
and
year
out
that
are
maintained
by
the
government,
that
it
will
maintain
these
records
in
accordance
with
the
war
of
the
land
and
have
them
producible
at
a
later
trial.
now,
the
government
also
contends
that
when
i
spoke
about
the
act
of
god,
we're,
of
course,
on
the
fire.
we're
talking
about
the
act
of
an
agent
and
also,
with
that
thought
in
mind,
the
protection
of
the
government,
it
seems
that
this
statute
clearly
indicates
that
in
the
event
of
a
producible
statement
not
being
produced,
that
the
testimony
of
the
witness
will
be
stricken.
and
i
say
that,
in
summation,
that
the
petitioner
submit
that
the
failure
of
the
government
to
produce
the
statement
of
the
witness
in
compliance
with
the
order
of
the
court
because
of
the
destruction
of
that
statement
by
a
government
agent,
is
the
equivalent
of
an
election
not
to
produce
and
hence,
the
testimony
of
the
witness,
staula,
ought
to
have
been
stricken
from
the
record.
to
hold
otherwise
would
be
to
stultify
the
decision
of
this
court
handed
down
in
the
jencks
case
and
to
proclaim
the
inability
of
the
jencks
act
to
carry
out
the
legislative
intent.
