mr.
roger
g.
connor
mr.
louison,
mr.
o'donnell,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
distinctly
takes
the
position
that
no
statement
has
been
adequately
shown
to
exist
on
the
record
that
is
before
us
nor
was
it
in
the
court
below.
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
in
the
statutory
sense,
that
no
statement
that's
alleged
to
have
been
destroyed
here
or
was
ever
shown
to
exist
sufficiently
to
require
a
reversal
here
or
to
bring
into
play
the
doctrine
which
has
been
asserted
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
your
honor,
i
have
consulted
with
the
officials
of
the
fbi
in
preparation
for
this
argument.
i
also
know
of
my
own
knowledge
from
the
past
practices
and
i
would
like
to
say
this.
that
since
the
jencks
decision,
there
has
been
no
changes
in
fbi
procedures.
procedures
were
changed
somewhat
in
june,
just
after
the
jencks
decision.
although,
even
there,
there
was
not
a
great
alteration
of
technique
and
since
then,
they
haven't
been
changed
at
all
in
this
respect.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
your
honor.
and
the
changes
that
were
made
after
jencks
were
all
calculated
to
aid
the
government
in
complying
with
the
jencks
decision
and
later,
with
the
statute.
we
didn't
even
change
our
procedures
after
the
statute
was
enacted
because
it
wasn't
necessary.
the
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
your
honor,
the
term
"raw
files,"
as
used
by
the
department,
i'm
sure,
referred
to
a
typewritten
matter
which
is
put
in
the
files
and
which
may
contain
all
sorts
of
things
of
a
hearsay
character
describing
investigative
techniques.
it
may
contain
scandal,
gossip,
any
number
of
things
and
it
may
contain
a
lot
of
matter
which
is
not
segregated
by
subject
classification.
for
example,
in
a
case,
there
might
be
something
said
about
the
subject's
personal
life
and
on
the
same
page,
there
might
be
something
said
which
relates
to
the
criminal
conduct
for
which
he
is
eventually
charged
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
--
there's
been
a
misconception
of
just
what
did
happen
there
or
what
staula's
testimony
on
this
point
is
and
our
brief
develops
it.
in
the
opening
part
of
our
brief,
we
start
on
page
4
to
describe
the
testimony
of
staula
on
this
point
and
it
will
be
seen
that,
at
one
point,
staula
said
that
--
first
of
all,
he
told
his
story
and
then
the
man
asked
him
a
few
questions,
that
is
the
fbi
man
and
then
he
--
he
wasn't
too
sure
whether
he
signed
it.
and
on
page
9
of
our
brief,
we
quote
from
the
record
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
no.
he
--
i
think
he's
highly
equivocal
on
this
point.
he
thought,
at
one
stage,
that
he
had
signed
something
and
there
is
one
portion
of
the
record
where
he
says
that
when
he
went
down
to
the
police
station
the
day
after
the
robbery,
he
thought
he
signed
something
saying
he
was
in
the
bank.
"but
i
didn't
sign
any
statement,"
he
said
or
he
didn't
sign
any
lengthy
document.
now,
on
page
8
and
9
of
our
brief,
we've
set
out
one
portion
of
the
testimony
on
this.
down
at
the
bottom
of
page
8,
we've
quoted.
the
court,
"now,
mr.
witness,
you
testified
here
on
cross-examination
that
you
talked
to
the
fbi
agent
and
that
he
asked
you
questions,
as
i
remember
it,
and
that
you
didn't
know
what
he
had
written
down
because
it
was
not
read
back
to
you.
didn't
you
testify
that
way?"
the
witness,
"i
didn't
remember.
since
then,
i
have
recollected.
he
didn't
actually
ask
me
questions.
i
mean,
at
first,
i
told
him
the
story
and
then,
when
i
got
through,
he
asked
me
a
few
questions."
now,
at
this
point,
the
court
cuts
him
off
by
saying,
the
court,
"well,
did
he
read
it
back
to
you?"
the
witness,
"i
believe
he
did."
the
court,
"what
is
your
best
memory
of
it?"
the
witness,
"i
am
pretty
sure
he
did."
well,
now,
if
i
could
stop
there
for
a
moment,
it's
customary
in
fbi
interviews
to
read
back
to
--
to
a
person
from
the
notes
that
the
agent
has
taken
to
confirm
and
verify
the
facts
that
the
agent
understands
he's
just
been
told,
so
there
won't
be
any
mistake
about
it.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
agent,
at
that
time,
has
in
his
hand
a
complete
elaborate
written
statement.
the
agent's
notes
may
be
nothing
more
than
hieroglyphics
or
personal
shorthand,
which
they
frequently
are,
and
i
think
that
this
is
what
is
involved
here.
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
the
best
inference
to
be
drawn.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
your
honor,
because
these
notes
have
never
been
considered
to
be
a
statement
in
the
sense
of
a
--
a
written
statement
signed
by
the
witness
nor
are
they
a
recording
of
--
are
they
a
verbatim
transcription
of
any
kind
or
a
verbatim
statement
and
they
have
never
been
thought
by
us
to
have
any
value
as
--
as
a
producible
statement
under
the
jencks
act.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
because
in
the
process
of
interviewing
a
witness,
the
agent
wants
to
make
sure
that
he
understands
the
story
correctly
and
he
may
confirm
certain
points
with
him.
now,
he
may
not
necessarily
read
back
to
him
what's
in
his
notes.
he
may
just
clarify
a
few
points.
maybe
his
notes
will
be
more
elaborate
than
this.
maybe
they
will
be
less
so.
this,
we
don't
know
from
the
state
of
the
record
here.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
we
--
we
do
not
agree
with
that
presupposition.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
in
our
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
in
our
brief,
we
have
a
counterstatement
of
the
question
involved
and
perhaps,
i
was
direly
tearing
up
beginning
with
that
because
we
do
not
agree
that
a
complete
foundation
for
it
is
made
or
was
made
in
this
case.
that
is
where
we
disagree.
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
we
formulate
a
counterstatement,
namely
that
whether
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
but
--
but
we
--
we
differ
on
this.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
no,
your
honor.
from
all
appearances,
the
notes
were
not
in
existence.
this
is
what
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
informed
the
court
of
--
below.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
and
he
doesn't
say
affirmatively,
the
assistant
doesn't,
in
the
record
that
he
talked
to
the
agent
but
we
assumed
that
he
made
some
inquiry
and
this
is
what
he
understood
to
be
the
case.
the
notes
were
undoubtedly
destroyed
because
it's
standard
fbi
procedure
to
do
so,
unless
they
have
evidentiary
value.
if
the
notes
had
--
have
been
signed
by
a
person
or
if
the
notes
contain
information
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
which
can
be
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
no,
your
honor.
the
destruction
of
notes
is
in
no
way
calculated
to
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
defeat
the
statute.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
right,
your
honor
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
but
that
is
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
fbi
has
not
stopped
taken
written
statements
where
it's
appropriate.
now,
how
they
determine
this
hinges
on
--
on
the
--
the
reality's
investigative
light
and
--
and
what
the
agent
sees
at
the
moment.
it
also
hinges
on
whether
the
witness
is
willing
to
give
a
statement
on
how
crucial
his
testimony
is
likely
to
become
in
an
--
a
number
of
other
things.
in
this
case,
at
the
time
that
they
interviewed
staula,
it
was
the
day
after
the
robbery
and
they
still
didn't
even
know
who
the
--
the
suspects
were.
they
were
looking
for
general
information
about
the
robbery.
and
on
this
point,
it's
important
to
point
out
that
staula,
this
same
day
after
he
talked
to
the
fbi
agent,
was
taken
by
the
city
police
down
to
a
service
station
where
he
looked
at
an
individual
and
he
said
he
couldn't
positively
identify
that
man.
he
then,
in
the
police
car,
was
shown
a
number
of
photographs
and
out
of
these
photos,
he
picked
lester
as
being
the
man
who
told
him
to
get
back
against
the
wall
in
the
bank.
and
that
is
how
staula
perfected
his
identification
of
lester.
the
fbi
man
never
talked
to
staula
again.
this
--
this
is
--
is,
i
think,
a
partial
explanation
of
what
happened
here.
when
the
fbi
man
talked
to
staula,
he
was
interested
in
the
general
picture
and
we
don't
know
what
kinds
of
notes
the
fbi
man
took.
but
whatever
he
took,
he
wrote
up
this
interview,
which
is
in
the
record,
this
interview
report
which
is
in
the
record.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
and
we
don't
call
them
notes,
your
honor.
we
call
that
a
written
statement.
the
fbi
is
very
careful
that
when
it
gets
a
statement,
it
is
an
ample
one
and
there
is
very
little
doubt
about
it
because
it
--
it
always
contains
a
prelude
about
the
individual
being
advised
of
his
rights
and
it
ends
up
with
who
the
agents
were
and
the
date
of
the
statement.
the
statement
usually
covers
the
subject
involved
quite
--
quite
amply
and
it's
something
that's
almost
instantly
recognizable.
now,
the
other
kind
of
report,
the
report
of
an
interview
of
a
witness,
runs
somewhat
in
the
form
of
the
one
that's
in
the
record
here.
and
this
is
a
very
usual
procedure
because
the
agents,
in
the
course
of
the
day
in
having
to
interview
many
witnesses
or
here,
trying
to
discover
who
did
this
robbery,
may
not
have
time
to
get
a
complete
written
statement
from
every
person
that
they
talked
to
and
in
this
case,
they
apparently
didn't.
they
were,
apparently,
scores
of
witnesses
to
this
robbery
who
testified
at
the
trial.
staula
was
just
one
of
many.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
indeed.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
oh,
the
agent
might
note
that
the
witness
is
nervous
or
any
number
of
things
like
that.
this
would
hardly
be
a
statement
of
the
person
and
under
the
jencks
concept.
it
would
be
unfair
to
confront
the
witness
with
this
when
he
was
called
to
the
stand
to
try
to
impeach
him
with
this
kind
of
material.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
he
wouldn't
and
i
don't
know
of
any
fbi
practice
of
a
witness
signing
notes.
i
--
i
really
don't,
your
honor.
they
have
no
--
no
established
procedure
of
--
of
having
witnesses
sign
notes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
except
where
--
where
a
witness
might
draw
a
sketch
or
something
like
that.
they
might
have
him
sign
it
in
that
circumstance.
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
and
under
established
procedures,
clear
procedures,
if
he
had
signed
those
notes,
they
would
be
retained.
that
is,
unless
the
agent
violated
his
duty
here,
those
notes
would
have
been
retained
and
kept
in
an
envelope
in
the
case
file.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
then
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
then
we
have
a
question
of
whether
it
is
a
statement
adopted
by
the
witness.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
i
certainly
do,
your
honor
because
the
notes
may
be
very
incomplete.
they
may
not
be
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
well,
my
--
my
reason
for
saying
that
i
don't
think
it
qualifies
is
that
these
notes
could
be
very
incomplete
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
you
mean
the
--
the
inter
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
the
report
of
interview
here.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
if
he
had
read
that
over
and
approved
it
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
that,
certainly,
that
would
come
in.
it
would
certainly
be
allowable.
we
have
no
argument
on
that.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
it's
not
the
important
thing
if
a
complete
statement
were
made
up
at
the
time
of
interview
and
approved
by
the
witness.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
your
honor.
he
--
he
said,
at
one
point,
"i
didn't
sign
anything.
i
just
--
and
then
there
was
a
cross-question.
"alright,
you
didn't
sign
it."
then
later,
he
thought
he
--
he
had
signed
it
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
and
on
another
occasion
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
he
wasn't
sure.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct,
but
i
--
i
don't
think
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
and
he
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
and
then
after
that
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
for
a
very
good
reason,
your
honor.
the
court
pointed
out
to
counsel
in
chambers
when
they
had
this
one
and
a
half
hour
conference
about
this
matter
that
--
in
fact,
it
was
suggested
by,
i
think,
mr.
louison,
that
the
government
should
call
the
agent,
perhaps,
to
clarify
this
and
the
court
said,
"no,
i
can't
allow
that
because
the
agent's
testimony
would
be
inadmissible."
you
may
call
him
and
he's
available
and
you
can
subpoena
him
or
you
can
have
the
assistant
u.s.
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
your
honor,
it's
in
the
transcript
which
we
have
filed
with
the
court.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
the
--
the
trans
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
your
honor,
because
we
didn't
know
the
--
the
existence
of
this
transcript
until
after
the
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
granted
here.
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
we
refer
to
this
transcript
in
a
footnote.
the
transcript
itself
or
the
--
the
conference
in
chambers
is
referred
to
by
the
judge
on
page
211
of
--
of
this
record,
at
the
top
of
the
page.
he
speaks
of
a
one
and
a
half
hour
conference
that
he
had
wherein
he
listened
to
arguments
and
we
had
a
full
discussion
of
the
briefs
and
where
i
finally
decided
and
made
a
conditional
decision.
now,
in
this
conference,
i
have
the
pages
of
the
--
the
typewritten
transcript
where
this
appears.
on
pages
1831
and
1832,
the
judge
finally
decided
to
follow
this
homely
procedure
of
--
of
showing
the
interview
report
to
the
witness
which
he
apparently
had
done
with
other
witnesses
in
this
trial
to
see
whether
he
--
he
agreed
with
this
and
adopted
it
as
a
statement.
and
at
that
point,
mr.
louison
said,
"your
honor,
i
think
we
should
have
special
agent
toomey
in
here
to
explain
where
he
got
the
document."
the
court,
"no,
listen.
special
agent
toomey
is
a
witness
you
have
a
right
to
subpoena
and
bring
in
here.
obviously
--
let
me
tell
you
something,
now,
mr.
louison,
i'm
glad
you
spoke
of
that
and
i'm
glad
mr.
o'donnell
has
been
over
it.
obviously,
no
special
agent,
no
peace
officer
can
testify
unless
he
can
testify
to
something
that
is
admissible.
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
because
toomey
could
offer
no
substantive
evidence
in
the
case.
he
had
apparently
only
talked
to
this
witness.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
right
and
secondly
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
right
and
secondly,
if
--
if
it's
a
question
then
of
impeaching
staula,
the
government
can't
bring
in
toomey
and
put
him
on
the
stand
unless
it
thinks
that
it
must
impeach
the
witness.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
he
probably
could
have
but
apparently,
it
didn't
occur
to
him.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
--
i
think
he
could
have
but
--
but
i
don't
think
that
injects
error
into
this
case.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
the
conference
is
lengthy.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
they
adjourned
because
at
the
end
of
one
trial
day,
staula
was
on
the
stand
and
counsel
then
made
their
demand
and
the
government
info
--
said
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
right.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
the
document
which
is
in
existence
is
what
we
call
a
report
of
interview.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
--
the
discussion
in
chambers
revolved
around
the
original
notes
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
made
by
the
agent
and
also,
around
this
question
of
then
shouldn't
this
also
be
produced
in
that
the
notes
are
not
available.
if
they're
not
available,
perhaps,
we
should
be
entitled
to
--
to
this
document.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
he
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
i
think
that
judge
mccarthy
indeed
could
have
called
him
in
camera
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
and
examined
him.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
mr.
louison
suggested
that
the
government
call
him
and
judge
mccarthy
pointed
out
that
the
government
couldn't
do
that.
it
would
probably
be
reversible
error
because
to
put
the
agent
on
the
stand
as
a
government
witness
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
no,
but
to
put
him
on
the
stand
and
have
him
tell
about
what
the
witness
told
him
at
the
interview
may
tend
to
support
the
witness.
it
may
give
the
jury
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
he
would
have
been
but
i
don't
think
he
was
offered
or
--
or
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
it
was
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
government
refused
to.
i
think
that
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
that
the
judge
said
that
"you
may
subpoena
him
as
a
witness."
that
was
the
language
i
--
i
quote.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
you
may
subpoena
toomey
so
he
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
because
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
because
the
government
put
him
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
think
he
was
available.
he
did
testify
in
this
case
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
at
the
outset.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
explanation
for
that
is.
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
may
have
felt
that
there
was
simply
no
need
to
do
it
here.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
don't
know
his
reasons.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
no,
i
don't
think
he
did.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
your
honor
reads
that
transcript,
you
will
see
that
the
court
was
trying
to
apply
the
statute,
struggling
for
an
interpretation
of
it
in
applying
it
in
this
case
and
perhaps,
it
didn't
occur
to
him
to
call
agent
toomey
in.
he
felt
that
--
that
absent
a
sufficient
showing
by
the
defense
counsel,
that
there
--
there
was
some
kind
of
a
statement
that
had
been
destroyed
that
--
that
he
need
not
act
further.
he
was
satisfied
when
the
government
told
him
that
he
didn't
have
the
statement
in
its
possession
and
--
and
he
indicated
that
--
that
it
was
up
to
them
to
call.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
think
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
--
i
think,
certainly,
that
would
be
a
wise
approach
to
take,
perhaps,
in
--
in
similar
cases.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
perhaps,
the
judge
could
have
acted
differently
than
he
did.
what
we
are
urging
is
that
this
was
not
reversible
error
because
the
defendants
were
given
an
opportunity
to
call
to
me.
they
knew
his
name.
i
think
he
was
available
because,
in
reading
the
entire
transcript
of
the
record,
i
think
only
one-ninth
of
it
is
before
you.
in
reading
the
rest
of
it,
i
saw
that
toomey
appeared
in
the
early
part
of
the
trial
to
identify
some
photographs,
unless
that
is
a
different
toomey.
perhaps,
counsel
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
there.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
i
--
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
what
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
well
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
--
i
think
that
if
counsel
would
have
conceded
in
answer
to
one
question,
if
the
summary
had
been
made
available,
it
certainly
would
have
altered
the
--
the
complexion
of
the
case
here.
now,
as
i
see,
i
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
it's
a
sound
inference
to
draw.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
if
the
original
notes
as
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
as
they're
called
here.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
do
differ
with
petitioners'
counsel
in
that
we
feel
that
no
statement
was
ever
shown
to
have
been
in
existence
adequately
enough
to
lay
the
foundation
for
production
here
and
that
there
was
an
avenue
opened
to
them,
namely
calling
the
agent
if
they
had
any
doubt
about
it.
they
have
raised
the
issue
here
and
then
tried
to
impale
the
government
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
whether
to
call
the
agent
or
not,
possibly
inject
reversible
error
into
the
trial.
and
in
this
posture
of
the
thing,
we
don't
think
the
question
has
been,
adequately
enough,
explored
below
to
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
it's
--
it's
well
shown
that
they
were
non-available.
i
don't
think
it
was
adequately
shown
that
these
original
notes
or
documents
that
were
destroyed
were
ever
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
producible
under
--
under
the
statute.
i
think
that's
where
we
take
grave
issue
with
the
petitioners.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
issue
as
to
that,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
your
honor,
the
fact
that
they
were
destroyed?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
it
wasn't
affirmatively
established
in
the
record.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
told
the
court
that
he
certainly
didn't
have
in
his
possession
any
notes
of
this
type
and
it's
--
it's
a
common
custom
of
the
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
don't
think
it
is
established.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
it
is
possible
that
the
agent
could
have
wrongfully
secreted
the
notes
but
that
isn't
shown
either
and
we
have
no
reason
to
suspect,
as
one
member
of
this
court
said,
that
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
federal
officers
go
around
looking
for
opportunities
to
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
engage
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
about
all.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
plus
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
pardon?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
except
that
in
chambers
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
that
this
conference
in
chambers,
something
--
something
occurred
on
this.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
the
conference
in
chambers?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
counsel
for
petitioner
were
there,
too.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
law
clerk
of
the
judge,
they
--
they
informed
me.
mr.
hurly
was
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
the
judge
--
[laughter]
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
stated
on
the
record
that
the
conference
was
to
be
very
informal
and
that
everyone
was
to
feel
relaxed
because
they
were
in
his
chambers.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
you
--
that
there
was
an
interview
report?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
proffered
it
to
the
court.
he
said,
"this
is
all
i
have."
mr.
roger
g.
connor
pardon?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
it's
at
the
end
of
the
--
the
record.
it's
at
page
212.
that
is
the
--
the
report.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
212.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
when
the
--
when
the
court
called
on
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
to
produce
any
documents
he
had,
he
gave
them
this.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
it's
--
it's
here.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
your
--
your
honor,
on
page
201,
at
the
bottom,
the
court
says
"have
you
got
in
your
possession
any
statement
that
was
copied
by
an
fbi
agent
which,
in
any
way,
would
reflect
a
statement
that
this
witness
made?
which
would
in
any
way,"
he
says.
and
mr.
hobley,
his
clerk,
says
"no,
your
honor,
we
don't."
mr.
roger
g.
connor
he
is
the
clerk
to
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
isn't
he?
he
--
he
is
part
of
the
u.s.
attorney's
staff.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
they
told
me
law
clerk
and
i
misunderstood
them
to
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
excuse
me,
hobley
and
hurly
are
two
different
people.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
so
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
hurly.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
now
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
there
was
at
an
earlier
time.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
this
--
this
is
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
they
say
that
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think,
at
some
point
back,
they
were
told
that
they
had
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
they
had
a
report
that
bore
on
it
but
they
had
no
statement
producible
within
the
statute.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
the
--
the
government
gave
that
to
the
court
and
the
court
looked
at
it
and
saw
the
nature
of
it
and
then,
after
this
conference
in
chambers
which
went
on
for
a
long
time,
he
went
back
into
the
courtroom
and
gave
this
to
the
witness
to
see
whether
he
would
adopt
it
as
a
state,
which
the
witness
did
not
do.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
then,
as
far
as
the
court
was
concerned,
that
concluded
it,
that
is,
the
witness
wouldn't
adopt
it,
so
it
certainly
was
not
producible
in
--
in
the
way
that
the
court
saw
the
situation
and
the
case
proceeded.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
don't
find
anything
directly
on
that
that
staula
said
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
i
think
they
were
talking
about
something
that
the
fbi
agent
wrote
down.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
he's
the
district
attorney.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
he
is
another
--
he
is
another
assistant
u.s.
attorney.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
he
and
hobley
were
trying
the
case.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
he
was
law
clerk
to
the
judge.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
well,
in
this
transcript,
i
do
recall
that
--
that
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
informs
the
judge
in
this
hearing
in
chambers
that
he's
checked
with
the
fbi
and
that
there
are
no
such
notes
in
existence.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
right.
in
fact,
your
honor,
on
page
204
where
the
asterisks
appear
near
the
top
of
the
page,
this
is
the
end
of
the
court
day.
and
the
judge
stayed
up
until
one
in
the
morning,
he
said,
looking
for
the
holy
grail,
that
is,
the
interpretation
of
the
jencks
act
and
the
next
day,
this
conference
occurred
in
chambers.
i
believe
it
consumed
a
good
part
of
the
morning.
it
was
after
that
that
the
court
resumed
trial
and
that's
where
dominic
staula
resumed
testimony,
as
appears
on
this
page.
this
gap
is
confusing
otherwise
but
those
asterisks
really
represent
conference
in
chambers
which
is
covered
by
that
transcript
which
we
have
filed
here.
and
in
that
transcript,
somewhere,
as
my
recollection,
that
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
said
that
he
checked
with
the
fbi
and
that
there
were
no
such
notes
in
existence.
now,
exactly
what
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
pardon?
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
i
don't
believe
he
did.
i
don't
believe
he
went
into
it.
the
judge,
in
this
conference
in
his
chambers,
spoke
of
knowing
about
the
fbi
practices
and
how
they
go
about
interviewing
witnesses
and
he
knew
that
they
often
took
written
statements
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
that
were
preserved
and
sometimes
not.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
don't
think
he's
very
specific
about
it.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
don't
think
staula
uses
the
term
"statement".
he
says
that
he
told
the
agent
his
story
and
that
they
asked
him
some
questions
and
they
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
i
don't
think
he
--
he
talked
about
them
writing
down
what
he
told
them.
now,
that
could
mean
terse
notes
or
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
say
that
it's
most
probable
that
they
were
notes
because
the
--
if
the
fbi
had
taken
a
lengthy
statement,
they
either
would
have
him
signed
this,
if
it
were
a
complete
statement
or
even
if
he
hadn't
signed
it,
they
probably
would
have
retained
it.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
nothing
in
the
record
but
what
i
think
is
--
is
a
reasonable
conclusion
from
the
established
practices.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
--
well,
for
one
thing,
i've
been
in
u.s.
attorney's
office
myself.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
have
talked
to
the
fbi
about
their
practices
to
--
to
be
sure
that
i
--
that
when
i
came
here,
i
didn't
make
a
mistake
in
--
in
putting
forth
the
government's
position
and
to
see
that
i
hadn't
overlooked
anything.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
sir,
anytime
that
a
witness
would
sign
a
statement,
it
would
always
be
retained.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
their
established
procedure.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
his
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
but
then
he
said,
later,
he
wasn't
sure.
he
was
equivocal
on
this
point.
and
the
government
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
the
government
can't
help
it
if
the
witness'
memory
is
poor
and
thinks
he
signed
a
statement
when
he
didn't.
that
is
the
--
the
difficulty.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
your
honor,
the
judge
asked
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
to
check
if
he
would
and
inform
the
court
whether
any
such
things
were
in
existence
and
apparently,
he
did
and
the
court
felt
that
this
was
enough.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
if
--
if
the
defense
wanted
to
explore
it
further,
it
had
avenues
opened
to
it.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
i
think
the
court,
in
the
course
of
this
conference,
showed
that
he
--
he
assumed
that
undoubtedly,
something
had
been
written
down
by
the
agent
but
he
also
didn't
assume
that
there
was
anything
improper
in
--
in
it
now
being
non-available.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
you
--
your
honor--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
and
he
even
makes
some
patriotic
lectures
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
in
the
course
of
this
transcript.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
the
--
the
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
what
happened
is
what
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
it's
set
forth
in
204
in
the
record
where
they
stopped
with
this
problem
of
staula's
statement
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
correct,
that's
what
we're
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
in
this
court.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
that's
what
every
--
that's
what
they
all
understood
to
be
the
case
then.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
the
--
if
--
if
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i
think
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
your
honor,
on
212,
we
have
the
--
what
we
call
the
"interview
report".
now,
this
is
what
the
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
fbi
agent.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
not
under
the
--
it
wasn't
producible
under
the
jencks
act.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
because
it
--
it
wasn't
a
written
statement.
it
wasn't
a
statement
of
proof
or
adopted
by
the
witness.
he
has
specifically
rejected
it
at
the
trial
when
it
was
shown
to
him.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
he
said,
"this
isn't
the
way
i
told
it
to
him.
it's
been
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
turned
around."
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
he
didn't
say
it
wasn't
true.
he
said,
"it
isn't
--
it
isn't
the
way
i
told
it
to
him."
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
the
point--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
it
--
it
--
there
are
little
ambiguities
in
this
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
summary
by
the
agent
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
that
don't
accord
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
to
the
way
he
testified.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
there
were
three.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no.
he
mentions
two
individuals,
one
man
in
a
chino
pants
and
another
man
in
a
blue
suit.
and
then
later
on,
the
agent
here,
in
reporting,
says
"mr.
staula
stated
that
he
did
not
observe
a
third
man
in
the
bank."
now,
that
was
what
the
--
the
dispute
is
partly
about
here.
if
the
agent
uses
this
term
"observe",
it
is
ambiguous.
he
could
have
meant
that
the
witness
saw
a
third
man
but
didn't
observe
his
physiogamy.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
now
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
no,
but
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
we
mean
non-existent
in
a
sense
that
whatever
it
was
that
the
agent
wrote
down
was
destroyed
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
before
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
no,
we
don't
contend
that.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
we're
--
we're
saying
that
the
agent
wrote
something
down
when
he
talked
to
staula,
that,
we're
sure
of.
and
it
might
just
be
better
to
say
that
whatever
this
written
matter
was,
it
was
destroyed.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
whether
it's
a
note
or
a
statement
or
whatever.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
i'm
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
and
maybe
that
gets
over
the
semantic
problem
a
little
bit
to
say
that
whatever
it
was
the
agent
wrote
down,
he
destroyed.
now
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
now
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
if
i
misstated
it,
i'm
sorry.
i
--
i
meant
to
say
that
we
didn't
feel
that,
on
the
record
here,
there's
been
a
showing
that
a
statement
producible
under
the
act
had
ever
been
destroyed.
that
if
something
was
destroyed
here
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that's
--
that's
correct,
which,
of
course,
gets
back
to
one
of
the
basic
purposes.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
well,
we
say
that
there's
certainly
no
showing
that
--
that
it
was
a
producible
statement
and
the
avenue
is
to
establish
this
were
open
to
the
defense
and
that
they
could've
called
the
agent
and
found
out
from
him
what
he
took
from
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
--
from
the
witness.
and
that
the
government
would
have
been
in
a
difficult
position
to
do
this,
at
least
in
open
court.
now,
it's
also
been
raised
here
that
the
judge
could
have
done
it
in
camera.
he
didn't
do
it.
but
that
still
leaves
us
with
a
problem
of
whether
that
is
reversible
error.
the
judge
here
selected
one
method
of
dealing
with
this
problem
and
we
don't
think
that
it
was
erroneous.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
g.
connor
yes,
and
--
mr.
roger
g.
connor
that
--
that
essentially
states
our
position,
your
honor.
i
see
i
only
have
a
few
minutes
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
talk
on
another
point
that
we
haven't
been
able
to
develop
and
that
is,
this
question
may
arise
that
if
the
witness
rejected
this
interview
report
as
being
his
statement,
was
it
inaccurate?
and
was
it
so
inaccurate
that
maybe
it
should
have
been
made
available?
and
our
answer
to
that
is
no.
in
our
brief,
we
have
analyzed
some
of
these
discrepancies
between
the
interview
report
and
what
staula
testified
to
on
the
stand
and
shown
that
they
are
not
substantial
and
that
the
judge
who
saw
this
report
and
who
heard
the
testimony
of
the
witness
didn't
think
they
were
substantial
enough
either
that
it
should
result
in
turning
over
this
fbi
report
to
the
defense
counsel.
for
a
--
one
of
the
points
was
how
many
men
were
in
the
bank
according
to
staula.
he
said
on
the
stand
there
were
three
men.
he
told
the
agent
--
well,
at
least
according
to
the
interview
report,
he
didn't
observe
a
third
man
in
the
bank.
that
could
mean
that
there
was
a
third
man
that
he
didn't
see
very
well
or
that
he
didn't
see
anybody.
and
of
course,
this
illustrates
the
equivocality
that
sometimes
creeps
into
reports
of
an
interview
and
why
witnesses
should
not
be
confronted
with
them
on
the
stand.
this
goes
back
to
the
congressional
purpose
behind
the
statute,
fairness
to
the
witness
in
the
process
of
impeaching
him
at
trial.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
no
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government
has
been
demonstrated
below
and
i
don't
believe
was
claimed
in
the
briefs
submitted
here
and
that
we
do
have
the
court
and
government
counsel
below
trying
to
do
what
they
thought
was
the
right
thing
in
complying
with
the
statute.
and
that
the
procedures
open
to
the
defense
were
not
completely
used.
if
they
had
any
doubts
about
this
problem,
they
could
have
pursued
it
further
but
did
not.
and
the
record
is,
therefore,
somewhat
equivocal
on
this
point.
we
submit
that
no
injustice
has
been
done
in
this
case
and
a
complete
reading
of
the
briefs
will
disclose
that
this
is
true.
thank
you.
