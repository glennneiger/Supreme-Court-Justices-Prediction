mr.
melvin
s.
louison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
so-called
jencks
statute,
18
u.s.c.
section
3500,
and
actually
presents
what
we
submit
to
be
a
novel
question,
partially
perhaps
due
to
the
newness
of
the
statute.
the
question
presented,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
whether
or
not,
after
a
foundation
for
the
admission
of
a
statement
as
defined
by
the
statute
is
laid
on
cross-examination,
is
the
production
of
that
statement
thereby
excused
when
the
prosecutor
states
that
the
original
document
is
no
longer
in
existence
and
cannot
be
produced.
and
further,
that
the
only
statement
in
the
possession
of
the
government
is
a
report
of
the
fbi
agent
in
charge
of
the
interview
which
does
not
meet
the
definition
of
the
--
of
a
statement
within
the
statute
as
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
palermo
decision.
now,
actually,
this
case
arises
out
of
indictments
for
bank
robbery
--
for
violation
of
the
federal
bank
robbery
act
and
resulted
in
convictions
of
the
three
petitioners
and
maximum
sentences
of
25
years
each
were
imposed
by
the
district
judge.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
actually,
does
not
help
us
in
any
respect
on
the
question
presented
to
this
court
at
this
time
for
the
reason
that,
as
shown
in
the
record,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
pretrial
report,
i
refer
to
page
6
--
216
of
the
record,
the
pretrial
report
does
--
the
question
concerning
the
pretrial
report
does
not
warrant
extended
discussion
in
view
of
the
recent
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
palermo
versus
united
states
and
that
was
the
subtle
substance
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
circuit
had
to
say
about
this
point
before
the
court
today.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
216,
mr.
justice
douglas,
of
the
record
and
i
refer
you
to
the
last
two
lines
on
that
page,
in
the
top
of
page
217.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
court
of
appeals
actually
took
the
principle
of
palermo
out
of
context
and
applied
it
in
its
naked
existence
to
a
--
an
entirely
different
factual
situation
and
they
did
that
in
this
manner.
in
the
palermo
case,
you
had,
of
course,
the
situation
of
a
statement
which
was
demanded
among
others
and
which
did
not
meet
the
definition
of
a
statement,
as
outlined
by
the
statute
and
ruled
on
by
this
court.
in
our
case,
we
have
the
situation
where
we
submit
to
the
court,
there
was
a
statement
in
existence
and
that
statement
was
no
longer
in
existence
and
this
report
now
was
the
only,
if
not
the
best,
available
evidence
of
what
had
formally
been
the
statement
of
the
witness
which
had
been
reduced
to
writing
and
approved
and
adopted
by
him.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
now
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
felt
that
we
did
not
--
we
were
not
in
a
position
where
we
should
have
been
required
to
call
the
agent
as
our
witness
and
--
because
the
witness
testified
in
this
case
that
the
agent
summary
was
not
precisely
as
he
had
stated
it.
he
said,
and
i
think
the
government
quotes
it
in
their
brief
and
saying
there
were
things
in
there
which
were
turned
around.
i
refer
to
page
23
of
the
government's
brief
in
which
they
said
they
knew
that
the
report
contained
something
different
from
staula's
testimony
since
staula
said
it
was
not
verbatim.
it
was
turned
around
and
it
was
not
written
up
just
the
way
the
story
is,
and
they
refer
to
their
own
pages
11
and
12
which
sets
out
excerpts
from
the
record.
but
if
i
may
--
i
didn't
want
to
reach
that
point
at
this
time
but
if
i
may,
i
will.
that
imposes
upon
the
petitioners
a
double
burden
of
proof.
number
one,
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
the
petitioners
to
establish
that
they
come
within
this
statute,
that
so-called
jencks
statute.
and
upon
establishing
that
foundation,
as
the
court
referred
to
it
in
our
present
case,
upon
establishing
that
foundation,
it
then
becomes
incumbent
upon
the
petitioners,
if
that
were
so,
to
show
that
the
government
has
no
excuse
for
not
producing
it
and
actually,
exculpation
if
the
defense
would
be
--
the
burden
of
it
would
be
upon
the
proponent
of
the
defense
or
the
excused.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no,
mr.
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no,
mr.
justice.
we
have
expressly
stated
in
our
brief
and
it
--
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
not
material
to
the
issue.
we
do
not
make
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
let
me
say
this
then.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
thereof.
the
agent
was
not
inquired
of
either
by
the
court,
by
the
government
or
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners
who
were
also
trial
counsel.
they
were
--
he
was
not
inquired
of
and
as
you
say
you
understand,
i
further
make
the
contention
that
we
do
not
consider
that
material.
we
consider
the
fact
of
existence
or
nonexistence.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
there
is
no
suggestion
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
of
bad
faith
or
improper
conduct
on
the
behalf
of
any
special
agent
of
the
federal
bureau.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
we
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
but
we
make
no
suggestion
that
anything
is
improper
occurred,
if
that
encompasses
your
honor's
question.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
we
make
no
--
there
is
no
--
there
is
nothing
of
record
to
show
how
or
why
or
that
there
was
any
bad
faith
involved
or
reprehensible
conduct
or
misconduct
or
even
negligence.
our
position
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
your
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no,
they
were
not
in
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
precisely.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
agent
himself,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it
from
what
we
do
have,
dictated
it
and
it
was
prepared
by
some
secretarial
help
at
the
bureau.
it
was,
however,
the
agent's
own
summary
from
what
he
had
received.
it
does
not
appear
of
record
whether
he
was
dictating
from
the
statement
he
took
from
the
witness
or
whether
he
was
using
his
own
memory.
it
just
appears
that
he
dictated
a
report
to
some
secretarial
or
perhaps
into
a
dictating
machine
which
was
transcribed.
and
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
witness?
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
i
--
i
can
read
it
for
you
verbatim
so
that
you
will
have
it
now.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
it's
on
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
page
200.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
--
the
witness
who
gave
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
not
the
agent,
the
witness.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
--
i
mis
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
agent
was
not
a
witness
for
anyone.
i
--
i
think
i
said
before,
he
was
inquired
of
neither
by
the
court
nor
the
government
nor
the
petitioners.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
oh,
i'm
sorry.
he
was
not
a
--
he
was
not
a
witness
in
any
respect
nor
was
any
federal
agent,
except
the
one
who
identified
photographs
of
the
bank
and
the
automobile
involved
but
there
was
no
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
that
it
appears
that
the
court
said
something
about
the
u.s.
attorney
would
have
him
available
and
it
was
the
contention
of
myself
and
my
colleague
at
that
time
that
we
would
not
call
a
special
agent
as
our
witness
once
we
complied
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
he
was
not
in
court
either
as
a
witness
or
a
spectator
to
the
knowledge
of
counsel.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
we
would
have
no
cause
to
argue
the
absence
of
the
witness.
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
not
such
as
would
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
give
rise
to
an
inference
for
a
jury
argument.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
correct.
that's
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
i
understand
he's
an
agent
in
charge
of
a
district
office
at
the
present
time.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
it
appears,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
not
in
that
many
words.
no
one
asked
if
he
were
dead
or
alive.
it
just
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
it
was
merely
stated
that
the
agent
was
available.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states
attorney
said
at
one
--
the
judge
suggested
that
he
inquired
of
the
u.s.
--
of
the
agent
to
determine
if
these
statements
were
in
existence
when,
at
that
time,
the
united
states
attorney
merely
announced
that
he
did
not
have
them
in
his
file.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
on
page
199
of
the
printed
record,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
at
--
that's
the
bottom
number.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
there
was,
apparently,
an
imperfection
in
the
printing
at
the
bottom
number.
page
199,
about
a
little
more
than
a
halfway
down,
it
says
"mr.
louison,
at
this
time,
we
should
like
to
request,
under
this
statute,
the
statement
of
this
man."
the
court
said,
"i
am
denying
it
because
you
have
laid
no
foundation
for
it
as
you
did
the
last
time.
this
man
said
nothing
was
ever
read
back
to
him,
so
i'm
denying
it
and
your
rights
are
saved."
at
that
time,
cross-examination
was
resumed
and
said,
"now,
mr.
witness,
when
you
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
this
is
now
the
--
staula,
the
witness
whose
statement
is
in
question.
this
is
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
government's
witness,
after
his
direct
testimony,
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
your
honor.
we've
asked
for
the
statement
of
this
witness
staula.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
and
he
is
now
under
cross-examination
by
mr.
o'donnell.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
correct.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
it
says
"when
you
said
you
had
a
conversation
with
the
fbi
some
time
less
than
a
week
after
july
18th,
did
they
write
down
what
you
had
to
say
then?"
the
court,
"if
you
know
the
witness?"
"yes."
and
at
the
top
of
page
200,
"and
did
they
read
it
back
to
you,
sir?"
answer,
"yes."
cross-question,
"and
did
they
ask
you
if
that
was
essentially
what
you
had
just
related
to
them?"
"and,
did
you
tell
them
yes?"
and
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
the
court
then
says
"i
will
order
it
produced.
there
is
a
foundation
laid
for
it."
now,
when
you
say
is
that
all
there
is,
your
honor
please,
the
government
makes
note
of
the
fact
that,
at
just
below
halfway
down
on
the
very
next
page,
the
witness
has
been
questioned
by
the
court
now
and
--
and
he
says
"if
you
will
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
mr.
justice
william
t.
mccarthy
of
the
boston
federal
court.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
it
was
immaterial
to
our
issue.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
may
i
state
this,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
precisely,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
should
like
to
state
this
also
in
--
in
just
--
perhaps,
paraphrasing
a
bit.
it
was
our
contention
that
once
we
met
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
we
were
entitled
to
production
of
the
statement.
if
there
were
an
excuse
or
a
defense
so-called
for
the
nonproduction,
then
it
was
incumbent
or
the
burden
of
proof
then
went
to
the
person
who
would
excuse
himself
from
performance
to
show
the
reason
for
nonperformance
and
therefore,
i
felt
at
the
time
that
i
would
not,
as
you
stated,
call
him
as
my
witness
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
to
ascertain.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
it's
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that
is
not
in
dis
--
at
the
time
of
trial,
we
did
not
know
that
but--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
it
is
not
in
dispute.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that
it
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
the
information
furnished
to
us
by
the
government
and
we
accept
it.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
can't
say
that,
your
honor
please,
in
that
very
way
because
all
i
say
is
i
do
not
know
what
happened
and
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
i
do
not
consider
it
material.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
actually,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
and
therefore
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
i
do
not
suggest
it.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
in
the
absence
of
knowledge,
i
do
not
suggest
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
we
found
out
that,
for
the
first
time,
your
honor
please,
on
appeal.
however
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
after
the
trial
was
over.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
in
the
trial,
your
honor
please,
on
page
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
your
honor.
actually,
the
court
said,
at
the
bottom
of
page
201,
"have
you
got
in
your
possession,"
addressing
the
united
states
attorney,
"any
statement
that
was
copied
by
an
fbi
agent
which,
in
any
way,
would
reflect
a
statement
that
this
witness
made
and
which
he
substantially
adopted
as
the
statement?"
mr.
hobley,
"no,
your
honor,
we
do
not."
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
he
was
an
assistant
to
the
assistant.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
here
is
an
issue
there
because
i
felt
that,
where
there
is
a
new
field,
there
perhaps
might
be
alternative
remedies.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
if
i
may
refer
to
page
207
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
says,
about
six
straight
lines
down,
just
--
well,
at
the
top
line,
i
said,
"we
move
to
strike
this
witness'
entire
testimony,"
just
below
that,
i
said,
"we
make
a
common
law
demand
for
that
document."
at
this
time,
the
us
attorney
said,
"what
document?"
and
i
said,
"the
one
he
allegedly
just
read,
which
was
the
summary."
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no,
i
do
not.i
just
take
the
position
that
if
the
government
removes
the
situation
from
the
confines
or
the
four
corners
of
the
statute,
then
we
go
back
to
the
common
law
and
find
ourselves
back
into
the
jencks
case.
may
i
refer
now,
mr.
justice,
to
page
210
of
the
record,
the
--
where
it
says
"mr.
louison,"
about
a
third
of
the
way
down,
it
says
"the
record
is
completely
without
explanation
as
to
the
original
document."w

the
printed
record,
about
one-third
of
the
way
down.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
if
the
petitioners
contend
that
if
such
a
situation
as
this
is
permitted
to
exist
and
be
approved
then,
actually,
we
have
now
found
a
way
for
the
government
to
eliminate
all
discovery
of
such
documents
which,
we
submit,
was
neither
the
intent
of
the
congress
in
the
passage
of
this
statute
nor
the
intent
of
this
court,
obviously,
in
the
jencks
case
and
certainly
not
so
in
the
palermo
case
which
followed
the
jencks
case.
and
we
earnestly
submit
that
imposing
a
double
standard
--
a
double
burden
of
proof
upon
the
petitioners
in
that
regard
is
equally
as
bad
as
the
--
giving
the
government
the
power
to
avoid
discovery
by
destroying
the
original
document
or
--
when
i
say
original
document,
i
mean
the
document
that
would
meet
the
definition
of
the
word
"statement"
within
the
statute.
in
that
regard,
i
might
say
that,
though
the
witness
said
he
thought
he
had
signed
the
statement,
there
is
actually
no
requirement
in
the
statute
that
he
had
--
that
he
sign
the
statement.
this
is
one
form
of
adoption
of
it
but
if
he
read
or
had
it
read
to
him
and
approved
and
adopted
it,
then
it
is
certainly
a
statement
within
section
3500
just
as
much
as
if
would
have
signed
it.
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
it
does
not
appear,
let's
say,
conclusively
in
the
record
that
it
was
signed
by
the
witness
does
not
preclude
us
from
obtaining
it.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
but
i
would
say
this,
your
honor,
in
addition.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
comes
within
the
statute.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
they
do
in
one
spot
and
i
refer
you
to
page
20
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
26
of
the
government's
brief
in
a
footnote
in
which
they
say
that
the
final
testimony
of
the
witness
was
that
he
thought
it
was
read
back
to
him.
but
if
you
notice,
the
witness
also
said,
"i
think
they
wrote
down
what
i
said
and
i
think
they
gave
it
back
to
me
to
read
over
to
make
sure
that
it
was
right
and
i
think
had
to
sign
it.
now,
i
am
not
sure.
i
couldn't
remember
before."
well,
that
does
not
actually
show
the
entire
nature
of
the
record
because,
on
page
201
of
the
record
from
which
this
excerpt
was
taken,
the
very
next
sentence
by
the
court
is
--
that's
about
all
the
way
down
the
bottom,
about
six
or
eight
lines
up.
the
court
said,
"and
he
said
it
was
read
back
to
him.
so,
if
that,"
referring
to
the
fbi
summary,
"if
that
is
a
transcript."
now
--
actually
i
can
actually
remember
this
witness
as
if
it
were
yesterday.
he
was
saying
"i
think
they
wrote
it
down
and
i
think
they
read
it
back
to
me
to
make
sure
that
it
was
correct
and
right,"
but
he
was
actually
stating
a
fact.
i
would
say
it's
uncontraverted
that
he
gave
a
statement
to
the
fbi
which
they
wrote
down.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
and
the
government's
footnote
on
page
26
of
their
brief
does
not
reflect
the
true
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
nature
of
the
record.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
that's
probably
so.
that's
our
contention.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
don't
--
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand,
mr.
justice.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
our
--
my
--
my
argument
can
continue
on
the
basis
that
it
should
have
been
produced.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
correct.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
certainly.
now,
the
government
has
also
said
by
way
of
excusing
the
situation,
and
they
seem
to
rely
on
various
actual
situations
in
an
attempt
to
excuse
it,
that
the
trial
judge
saw
the
document
in
camera
and
did
not
see
fit
to
cross-examine
the
witness
on
the
basis
of
it
and
he,
being
the
impartial
master
of
the
trial,
could
have
done
so
if
he
were
disturbed
by
any
apparent
or
alleged
inconsistency.
and
the
short
answer
to
that,
i
think,
was
spelled
out
in
the
rosenberg
case
where
it
said
that
it's
within
the
realm
of
counsel's
discretion
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
useful
matter
contained
in
the
--
in
the
statement
for
cross-examination
and
it
would
not
be
the
province
of
the
court
to
second-guess
counsel
in
that
regard.
and
of
course,
they
state
that
--
i
want
to
reach
this
point
rather
quickly,
they
state
that
if
error
appears
in
this
trial,
it
pertains
only
to
the
petitioner
lester
because
he
was
the
one
who
was
named
by
this
witness
or
identified
by
this
witness.
now,
i
say
this.
where
the
original
document,
assuming
that
it
should
have
been
produced
if
it
had
been
in
existence,
where
the
original
document
is
no
longer
in
existence
and
cannot
and
has
not
been
preserved
for
review
by
any
appellate
court,
we
are
unable
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
any
prejudice
to
any
of
the
other
petitioners.
and
therefore,
it
must
be
held
to
be
prejudicial
to
all
if
it
is
prejudicial
to
any,
and
this
occurs
because
of
the
fact
that
--
this
occurs
because
of
the
fact
that
a
statement
might
contain
things
that
the
witness
did
not
testify
to
in
his
examination
which
might
be
the
subject
of
cross-examination
as
to
"why
didn't
you
say
this,
mr.
witness,
when
back,
so
close
to
the
time
of
the
event,
you
did
say
this?"
and
of
course,
the
statute
there,
again,
does
not
say
that
the
statement
to
be
producible
must
relate
only
to
what
the
witness
stated
on
his
direct
examination.
it
states
that
it
must
be
related
to
the
subject
matter
and
therefore,
matters
contained
in
the
statement
to
which
he
did
not
testify
to,
provided
they
related
to
the
subject
matter,
would
be
the
proper
subject
of
production
and
subject
to
cross-examination.
so
--
and
of
course,
there
is
also
the
position
in
the
jencks
case
that
inconsistency
is
not
a
prerequisite
to
production
and
of
course,
the
statute
does
not
make
any
such
requirement
that
there'd
be
a
preliminary
showing
of
inconsistency.
so,
without
the
necessity
of
showing
inconsistency,
as
well
as
the
situation
where
the
nonexistent
document
cannot
tell
you
--
you,
members
of
the
court,
what
was
contained
there
in
its
original
form.
the
prejudice,
if
there
would
be
any,
is
to
all
the
petitioners
and
not
to
any
one
particular
petitioner
because
this
man
merely
stated
his
name
on
the
direct
testimony.
now,
there
is
one
other
point
which
i
think
is
essential
and
that
is
the
government
has
stated
that
when
must
they
have
it
in
their
possession
if
it
is
called
for,
and
they
say
it
must
be
in
their
possession
at
the
time
production
is
demanded.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
untenable
and
we
have
included
in
our
brief
reasons
showing
that
it
must
be
held
to
be
at
any
time.
if
the
statement
were
in
existence
and
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
at
any
time,
then
it
is
--
comes
under
the
purview
of
the
statute
and
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
protection
from
it,
from
the
destruction
thereof
at
any
time
after.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
we
have
a
right
to
obtain
sanctions.
my
--
my
colleague
is
now
going
to
address
the
court
on
the
question
of
striking
out
the
motion
to
strike.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
we
are
entitled
to
sanctions.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
in
the
first
instance,
that's
so.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that
is
exactly
so,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put
the
question
to
me
that
"outside
of
this
situation,
would
you
concede
that
this
statement
did
not
come
within
the
statute
as
such?"
and
i
said
yes,
but
i
do
not
think
that
that
reflects
on
the
answer
i
just
gave
you.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
at
no
time,
your
honor,
except
during
the
appellate
matter
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
impounded
and
that's
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
a
matter
of
record.
it
was
impounded
and
it
was
opened
for
the
first
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
never
available
to
petitioners
at
any
time
during
the
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
for
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
correct.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
court
of
appeals
clerk's
office
just
told
me
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
bound
by
an
impoundment
order
of
the
district
court
and
they
opened
it
just
like
that.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
certainly.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
certainly.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
in
our
matter
of
--
in
the
--
one
of
our
points
in
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
claimed
it
was
error
and
showed
that
inferences
to
be
taken
from
that
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
could
have
resulted
in
cross-examination.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
if
your
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
if
your
question
means,
your
honor,
did
we
do
something
in
addition
to
the
perfection
of
our
appeal,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
we
continued
with
our
appeal
and
that
being
one
of
the
points
of
our
appeal.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no,
the
court
had
in
camera
inspected
that
document
and
had
full
knowledge
of
it
and
we
had
no
reason
to
believe
he
would
make
any
different
decision
on
a
motion
than
he
had
originally
upon
our
demand
both
for
the
document
to
strike
the
testimony
and
for
production
of
the
summary.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
obviously,
from
the
very
short
nature
of
their
opinion
on
this
point,
they
didn't
do
very
much.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
couldn't
have
anticipated
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
their
actions,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
right.
that's
a
matter
of
argument.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
correct.
in
addition
to
the
appeal,
no.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
mr.
o'donnell
for
the
petitioner,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
precisely
what
i
intended.
i
think
i
used
the
words
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
do
not
suggest
any
wrongdoing
and
of
course,
that
was
based
on
the
fact
that
i
had
no
evidence
of
it
and
as
you
sated
about
the
same
way
you
just
did
now
to
mr.
o'donnell
was
precisely,
as
i
understood,
what
i
had
said.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
the
second
thing
you
stated,
your
honor,
is
precisely
what
i
have
suggested
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
even
to
that
conference
in
lobby,
and
i
can
read
it
for
you
which
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
read.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
did
i
throw
it?
no,
your
honor,
i
did
not
throw
it.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no.
i
had
no
evidence
of
it
and
i
wasn't
to
suggest
it,
and
i
did
not
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
want
the
fbi
agent
as
my
witness.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that's
right,
that
there
must
be
compliance
with
the
statute
or
there's
a
vacuum.
i
do
have
my
rights
and
i
don't
have
my
rights.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
and
if
i
may,
if
--
if
it
please
the
court,
read
at
this
time,
judge
mccarthy
did
say
"i
have
a
great--
"
page
1806
of
their
transcript,
"i
have
a
great
deal
of
confidence
in
this
bureau.
i
know
how
this
bureau
operates."
from
--
there's
an
old
accent
latin
maxim,
"ex
nihilo
nihil
fit"
from
nothing
--
nothing
comes.if
the
original
notes
were
destroyed,
how,
in
the
name
of
god,
could
a
defendant
bring
in
and
have
available
for
him
that
which
a
witness
will
say,
"that
was
what
he
read
back
to
me
and
i
adopted
it
as
the
statement
he
made."
"how
are
you
going
to
show
it?"
in
addressing
the
u.s.
attorney,
he
said,
"all
you've
got
to
do
if
that's
the
case
and
defeat
this
act
by
making
copies
and
tearing
up
the
originals."
so,
that
point
which
you
suggested
as
point
two
in
which
we
impress
upon
the
court,
it
would
happen
way
back
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
was
suggested
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it's
pressed
here
in
this
court.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
all
i
say
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
don't
wish
to
engage
in
quarrel
with
his
honor.
all
i
say
is
that
i
have
no
evidence
of
wrongdoing
and
as
the
chief
justice
heard
from
what
i
said,
it
was
what
i
intended
to
say
and
what
i
understood
in
my
mind.
i
had
no
evidence
of
it
and
i
was
not
about
to
suggest
it
because
i
do
not
consider
it
important
to
the
outcome
of
this
case.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
therefore,
i
was
not
going
to
engage
in
quarrel
with
the
federal
bureau.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
he
said
that
there
was
an
inference.
he
did
not
--
as
i
understood,
of
course,
i
don't
speak
for
him.
all
i
state
is
what
my
position
was,
as
--
as
the
chief
justice
heard
it
and
interpreted
it.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
[laughs]
that's
alright.
my
time
has
expired,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
see.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
then
i
wish
to
say
this,
your
honor
please.
as
the
various
justices
and
yourself
has
interpreted
this
matter,
it
comes
down
to
the
point
where
assuming,
now,
all
the
best
in
favor
of
the
government
but
taking
the
position,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated,
that
there
was
a
statement
in
existence
at
one
time
which
was
producible.
now,
if
that
be
so,
now
take
the
evidence
in
favor
of
the
government
that
it
was
either
lost,
destroyed
or
misplaced
for
nothing
but
the
very
best
of
reasons
on
behalf
of
the
government.
what
happens
to
--
to
the
defendants
who
have
the
protection
of
the
statute
and
therefore,
the
statute
was
passed
to
limit
the
right
to
discovery
after
jencks,
and
what
--
what
do
we
have
now?
the
government
now
says,
"well,
we
don't
have
it
in
our
possession."
and
by
the
way,
the
statute
says
"in
the
possession
of
the
united
states".
it
does
not
limit
it
to
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
any
branch
of
the
government
"in
the
possession
of
the
united
states."
what
do
we
have?
the
statute
was
passed
to
limit
our
demands.
now,
we
come
within
the
limitations
and
we're
left
hanging
in
the
air.
and
--
and
i
say
that
is
--
that
cannot
be
the
intent
of
the
congress
and
as
i
read
the
prior
cases
in
--
in
the
rosenberg,
palermo,
jencks
and
what
inferences
you
can
take
from
all
of
them
in
the
various
opinions
in
them,
there
must
be
a
solution
and
there
must
be
an
alternative.
there
must
be
a
sanction,
as
i
stated
in
my
original
argument.
if
the
requirements
of
the
statute
are
not
complied
with,
then
what
happens?
now,
true,
the
secondary
evidence
may
be
given
to
us
or
it
may
be
stricken
but
there
must
be
something.
it
can't
be
left
hanging.
you
--
your
honors
will
notice,
when
the
time
comes,
that
--
in
studying
the
record,
that
it
does
appear
in
the
record
that
judge
mccarthy
ordered
production
of
the
statement.
he
says,
"i
will
order
it
produced."
there's
been
a
foundation
here.
and
then,
he
never
referred
to
it
again.
it
was
left
in
a
state
of
a
suspended
animation.
why?
because
we're
left
with
the
same
vacuum
we're
left
here
--
with
here
this
afternoon.
there
seems
to
be
no
solution,
unless
our
position
is
adopted
that
the
solution
as
we
--
the
evidence
is
either
stricken
as
is
required
by
the
statute
or
in
the
alternative,
we
get
the
secondary
evidence.
but
i
submit
in
closing
that
there
must
be
a
solution.
the
law
wasn't
intended
to
leave
a
vacuum.
