mr.
louison,
you
may
proceed
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
agent
himself
type
those
--
typed
the
summary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
witness
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
are
you
talking
about
the
agent
or
the
witness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
louison,
in
--
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
do
i
understand
your
answer
to
be
that
because
of
lack
of
information
on
your
part,
you
do
not
know
what
caused
the
destruction
of
this
document
and
you
felt
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
--
it
was
not
incumbent
upon
you
to
--
to
call
a
government
agent
and
make
him
your
witness
in
order
to
try
to
ascertain?
it
was
--
it's
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
position
that
that
was
a
responsibility
of
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
is
that
--
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
statement
ever
made
available
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
up
to
this
time
--
but
at
--
you
did
learn
the
contents
of
at
the
time
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
connor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
o'donnell,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
a
legal
document?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
o'donnell,
as
i
understood
your
--
your
associate,
i
--
i
may
be
entirely
mistaken
about
it.
as
i
--
as
i
understood
him,
he
didn't
vouch
for
the
fact
that
there
was
--
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
what
the
government
did.
all
he
said
in
response
certainly
to
my
question
was
that
for
want
of
information,
for
want
of
knowledge
on
the
subject,
as
disclosed
in
this
record,
he
made
no
charge
of
--
of
wrongdoing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
--
if
he
said
more
than
that,
i
--
i
didn't
correctly
understand
him
but
that's
all
i
understood
him
to
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
connor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
sure
that
he'd
been
--
it
had
been
shown
to
him
and
that
he
had
approved
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
whether
it's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
it's
hieroglyphics
or
--
or
whether
it's
in
english,
if
--
if
it
is
recorded,
it
might
be
shorthand.
but
if
it
is
recorded
and
it
is
acknowledged
by
the
witness
to
have
been
what
he
stated,
is
it
not
--
does
it
not
then
come
under
the
jencks
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
the
agent
asked
him
then
if
that's
what
he
stated?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he'd
hardly
--
hardly
show
the
witness
that
kind
of
notes
and
ask
him
to
sign
up
though,
would
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
they
have
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
this
was
your
witness
who
said
that
to
take
your
--
your
own
view
of
the
testimony
as
most
favorable
of
the
government,
that
he
thought
it
was
handed
to
him.
he
thought
he
read
it.
he
thought
he
signed
it.
now,
that's
your
--
that's
--
that's
your
witness
and
as
i
understand
it,
there's
nothing
contrary
to
that
in
the
record,
is
there,
and
--
and
why
shouldn't
you
be
bound
by
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
know,
but
this
is
your
witness.
this
isn't
their
--
this
isn't
their
witness.
this
is
your
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you're
bound
by
what
your
witness
says.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
aren't
you
bound
by
the
things
that
he
says
in
favor
of
the
defendant,
as
well
as
the
things
that
are
said
in
favor
of
the
government?
and
if
you
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
are,
why
isn't
this
a
statement
that
qualifies
under
jencks?
because
he
said,
"i
think
--
i
think
he
showed
it
to
me.
i
think
i
read
it.
i
think
i
signed
it."
now,
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
wanted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
disprove
that
that
was
--
wasn't
the
fact,
why
couldn't
you
--
that
that
was
the
fact,
why
couldn't
you
have
brought
the
agent
there
to
say,
"well
--
well,
i
didn't
show
it
to
him.
he
didn't
sign
it
and
i
didn't
read
it
to
him."
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
wasn't
offered
by
the
government
but
counsel
for
the
defendant
insisted
that
he
should
be
--
should
be
in
there
and
the
government
refused
to
--
to
produce
him,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
other
words
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
other
words,
a
--
they
--
he
said
it's
the
obligation
of
the
defense
to
bring
him
instead
of
the
obligation
of
the
prosecution.
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
mean
that,
if
you'd
wanted
to,
you
couldn't
have
brought
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
i
don't
mean
physically.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
mean
physically
but
i
mean
if
you
wanted
to
establish
in
camera
before
the
judge
on
this
proceeding
that
the
--
the
notes
had
not
been
shown
to
the
witness,
that
he
had
not
been
asked
to
approve
them
and
that
he
had
not
signed
them,
you
could
have
brought
the
agent
there,
could
you
not,
and
--
and
had
him
testify?
but
you
didn't
want
to
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
whatever
reason
it
was,
you
didn't
want
to
do
it.
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
the
reason.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said
you
didn't
want
to
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
that
established
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
--
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
was
it
established?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
let's
not
talk
about
custom.
you
say
it
was
clearly
established
in
the
record
that
--
that
the
notes
were
destroyed.
i
asked
you
how
and
where
that
was
clearly
established.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
we're
--
then,
you
don't
need
to
go
any
further.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
i
wasn't
saying
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
just
trying
to
explore
your
statement
that
it
was
clearly
established
that
the
notes
were
not
in
existence.
that's
all
i
want
--
all
i
want
to
ask
you
about,
where
--
where
it
was
in
the
record.
you
say
it
isn't
there,
so
that's
all
there
is
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
isn't
testimony,
that's
just
a
colloquy
between
the
judge
and
--
and
the
assistant
district
attorney,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
mr.
hurly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
mr.
hurly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
judge
was
in
a
colloquy
there
with
his
law
clerk
and
[laughter]
that's
--
that's
the
way
we
make
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
212,
down
below.
that
--
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
statement
but
where
--
where
--
how
did
it
come
into
the
record?
i
understood
justice
frankfurter
asked
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what?
the
law
clerk
for
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who's
the
clerk,
hobley
or
hurly?
chief
justice
earl
warren
hurly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
why
they
were
no
such
note?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
say
why
they
were
no
such
notes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you're
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
customary
for
the
fbi,
after
--
after
their
agents
have
--
have
interviewed
a
witness
and
they
had
written
extensively
and
have
shown
it
to
the
witness
and
the
witness
has
adopted
it
as
his
own
and
signed
it
to
thereafter
destroy
that
document
just
because
they
made
a
summary?
is
that
the
practice
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
fbi?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
your
own
witness
here
then
by
saying
that
he
did
not
sign
it?
he
says
"i
think
i
signed
it."
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
your
own
witness.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
do
have
the
man
who
--
who
should
have
a
very
accurate
knowledge
of
it
and
you
could
produce
him
for
this
record
if
you
had
wanted
to
do
it.
you
could
have
produced
the
agent
who
--
who
had
said,
"i
just
took
a
few
desultory
notes
and
--
and
i
--
i
said,
generally
speaking,
is
this
what
you
told
me?
and
--
and
then,
i
went
back
and
made
a
summary."
he
could
have
said
that
very
easily
and
cleared
up
a
lot
of
these
matters
if
that
was
the
fact
but
you
didn't
choose
to
do
that
or
to
use
him
for
that
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
told
me,
a
few
moments
ago,
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
that
all
--
all
the
united
states
attorney
reported
was
that
there
were
no
such
notes
in
existence
and
i
ask
you
if
he
also
reported
that
there
--
that
there
had
or
had
not
been
any
at
one
time
and
then
they
were
later
destroyed,
and
you
said
there
was
nothing
of
that
kind.
now,
if
you
were
pursuing
it
to
find
out
why
--
why
wouldn't
you
pursue
that
when
you
talked
to
your
agent?
"are
there
such
notes
in
existence
as
far
as
you
know?"
"no.
there
are
none."
"were
there
any?
did
you
--
did
you
take
any?
and
if
so,
what
did
you
do
with
it?"
but
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that,
apparently,
was
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
not
made
available
to
--
not
made
available
to
counsel,
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
louison.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
louison,
before
you
start,
would
you
mind
just
clearing
up
in
my
mind.
there
was
some
--
some
little
question
as
to
whether
you
and
your
--
your
counsel
agreed
on
--
on
the
situation
or
disagreed.
and
i
--
i
would
just
like
to
pursue
the
one
question
that
i
asked
you.do
you
vouch
for
the
fact
that
the
government
did
not
do
anything
irregular
or
do
you
say
that,
for
want
of
the
information,
you
do
not
--
you
do
not
contend
that
the
government
did
anything
wrong?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
--
there
is
a
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
when
the
red
light
comes
on.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do
have
two
or
three
minutes
more,
i
think,
if
you
wish
to
use
it.
