justice
john

harlan
how
about
the
agent
himself
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
go
back
to
your
basic
position
which,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
once
--
once
you've
laid
a
foundation
by
showing
that
there
was
a
statement
then,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
government
doesn't
produce
it,
you
are
entitled
to
have
his
testimony
stricken.
that's
your
basic
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
supposing
the
government
had
said,
"alright,
we
haven't
got
this
statement.
we
will
now
produce
the
witness
to
whom
this
statement
was
made
and
we'll
put
him
on
the
stand
and
examine
him
ourselves
to
show
what
this
statement
was."
under
your
view,
could
you
have
excluded
that
testimony
and
stood
on
your
rights
to
have
the
statements
--
to
have
the
witness'
testimony
stricken?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
could've?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
did
have
an
opportunity
and
means
of
reconstructing
the
statement
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
by
calling
a
witness.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
say
the
government
has
got
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
failing
to
produce
which,
by
hypothesis,
let's
presume
for
a
moment,
was
a
perfectly
honest
failure
to
produce.
take
it
on
that
premise
at
least.
and
you
say
the
government
has
got
to
suffer
the
consequences
of
its
failure
to
produce
without
your
laying
any
further
foundation
by
trying
to
resort
to
the
testimony
of
the
agent
to
reconstruct
the
statement
that's
not
in
existence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
if
there
wasn't
a
written
statement,
how
can
you
get
a
written
statement
that
doesn't
exist?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
the
statement
that
was
unavailable?
is
that
the
one
you're
taking
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
the
other
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
witness
may
have
had
a
vivid
memory.
maybe
he
could
have
given
it
to
you
verbatim.
how
do
we
know?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
the
judge
was
talking
about,
judge
mccarthy.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
of
whether
he
could
have
testified
to
the
contents
of
the
statement
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
be
willing
to
stand
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
would
you
be
willing
to
stand
on
the
position
taken
by
the
government
in
the
brief
because
your
brief
is
written
without
adding
this
additional
point
that
you
made
that
there
never
was
a
statement
anyway?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
probably
misstated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that,
but
the
only
thing
you
argue
in
your
brief
is,
number
one,
that
since
the
original
statement,
notes,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
were
destroyed,
therefore,
you
couldn't
be
required
to
produce
this
secondary
thing
as
a
substitute
because
the
agent
--
because
staula
has
repudiated
the
secondary
notes
of
the
agent.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
now,
you've
been
arguing,
as
i
understand
it,
that
apart
from
that,
apart
from
that,
that
even
though
this
statement
had
been
--
the
original
statement
had
been
in
existence,
it
was
a
non-producible
statement
under
the
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
