so
if
staula's
recollection
that
he
did
sign
this
is
correct,
then
it
would

that
these

just
simply
notes.

what
we
do
have
is
the
bottom
of
page
201
on
the
top
of
page
202
and
that's
about
it,
isn't
it?
that's
all
we
have.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
justice
potter
stewart

you
finished?

--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
else
besides
the
bottom
of
201
and
the
top
of
202
on
this
issue?
