justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
get
what
the
page
you
were
reading
there.
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
statement
in
the
statutory
sense.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
wonder
if
you
tell
the
court
that
since
palermo,
there
have
been
any
administrative
internal
rules
or
regulations
or
change
of
practice
for
the
destruction
of
the
original
notes
and
putting
them
into
summary
for
so
long?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
there
any
change
made
after
palermo?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understood
you
to
answer
with
me
that
the
notes
were
in
existence
but
the
summary
was
the
only
one
that
was
at
the
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
said
he
didn't
have
them
but
that
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
then
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
if
the
notes
are
always
destroyed,
that
was
what
my
original
question
was
aimed
at
then
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
palermo
gives
us
an
around
--
a
way
around
the
entire
statute.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
not
saying
in
purpose.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean,
i
don't
say
that's
the
purpose
of
the
destruction
of
notes
but
if
that
is
the
fact,
if
that
is
the
system,
then
the
--
the
statute
is
--
has
no
force
in
the
fact.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
summary
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
clear
from
palermo
that
the
summary
never
does
come
within.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
was
just
staula.
