is
there
any
suggestion
that
the
destruction
was
due
to
any
reprehensible
or
--
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
otherwise
or
--
or
--
justice

--
to
any
extent
due
to
any
--
any
cause
subject
to
criticism?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
but
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
loss
--
justice

--
that
the
loss
of
view
--
justice

--
loss
of
either
willfulness

or
anything.
justice

where
are
the
references
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
nature
of
the
so-called
original
statement
was,
namely
how
it
was
taken,
what
its
volume,
on
what
medium
it
was
expressed,
where
is
all
that?
do
you
have
them
on
the
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
examine
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
were
there
any
limits
put
on
the
questions
you
could
put
therein?
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
just
tell
me
where
it
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
agent
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
agent
a
witness
for
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
that
to
be
as
to
this
subject
matter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
would
it
appear
whether
he
was
available?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
statute.
but
generally,
was
he
a
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
wasn't
kept
from
testifying
by
the
government
so
as
to
lead
you
to
say
to
the
jury,
point
out
the
fact
that
the
government
didn't
call
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
wasn't
any.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wasn't
withheld
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
alive?
does
one
know
that,
whether
he
was
alive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
he
--
was
it
known?
did
it
appear
that
he
was
alive
while
these
proceedings
were
going
on?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
in
the
record
is
there
a
description
or
what
--
where
can
i
find
a
description
of
the
--
of
the
destroyed
document
or
the
non-existing
document?
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
given,
what
the
--
the
general
contents
was
etcetera,
etcetera?
justice
felix
frankfurter
199?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
you
got
me
confused.
the
witness
whose
statement
is
in
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
gives
--
he
tells
us
what
he
did,
what
was
taken
from
him
and
what
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
there
is
in
the
record
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
the
way,
who
is
the
trial
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
for
nonproduction,
you
say,
is
--
was
nonexistent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
in
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
your
case
here,
is
it
in
dispute
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
document
to
which
you
were
entitled,
never
mind
whether
you're
entitled
to
anything,
the
particular
doctrine
was
not
in
existence?
there's
no
controversy
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
also,
that
there's
no
--
and
--
and
it
--
also
not
in
controversy.
there's
any
suggestion
that
its
nonproduction
or
its
nonexistence,
if
you
will,
was
due
to
any
untoward
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
do
not
suggest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
i
understand
your
legal
point.
i'm
trying
to
get
its
facts
and
not
as
a
legal
argument
which
comes
up
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
not
suggesting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
not
suggesting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
he,
an
assistant
to
u.s.
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
talking
about
the
nonexistence
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
the
one
that's
referred
to
by
the
judge.
have
you
got
--
on
page
201,
have
you
got
in
your
possession
any
statement
that
was
copied
by
an
fbi
agent?
they
were
talking
about
the
--
the
document
which
you
asked
for
which
was
in
existence
and
the
production
was
denied,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
before
you
--
is
there
any
--
does
the
government
controvert
your
position
that
the
document
taken
from
the
witness,
the
original
document,
the
document
that
they
are
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
comes
within
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
see
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
read
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
i
read
their
brief,
and
that's
all
i've
done,
they
do
not
argue
that
the
original
statement
was
outside
of
the
jencks
case
because
if
that
was
true,
it
would
be
a
fortiori
to
the
non-accurate
or
fair
subsequent
summary
of
it
was
not
within
--
i
mean
the
whole
brief,
presupposing
that
the
original
thing,
which
is
nonexistent,
could
have
been
proffered
and
should
have
been
produced
had
they
been
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
assume
your
argument
can
go
out
on
that
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
case,
the
government's
case
to
assume
that
the
original
nonexistent
things
could
have
been
called
for
because
if
they
could
not
have
been
called
for,
a
fortiori
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
unfair
summary
of
it
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
--
if
i
understand
your
argument.
i
thought,
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
clear,
that
your
argument
could
be
--
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
if
the
nonexistent
documents
were
in
existence,
they
--
a
call
for
them
would
have
--
would
have
had
--
would
have
had
to
be
honored.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
also
understood
you
to
answer
quite
clearly
to
justice
brennan
that
you
do
not
think
the
existing
document
which
was
denied
to
you
does
not
come
as
such
within
the
jencks
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
could
not
be
called
for
under
the
jencks
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
i
do
not
see
why
you
recur
to
what
the
statute
requires
because
the
statute
conceded,
as
i
get
the
government's
faith,
would
have
required
the
production
of
the
nonexistent
document
and
the
statute
concededly
also
by
you
as
such
would
not
require
the
existing
document.
and
your
claim
is
because
the
existing
--
to
be
required
document
no
longer
exist,
you
have
a
right
to
call
for
the
other
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
derive
from
two
statements
that
i
--
that
i
put
to
you
to
find
out
whether
you
agree
or
not,
namely
the
destroyed
document
concededly
could
have
been
called
--
the
nonexistent
document
concededly
could
have
been
called
for
and
the
existing
documents
concededly
is
not
callable
under
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
reason
for
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
you
--
did
you,
on
the
basis
of
that
knowledge,
make
any
move
either
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
light
of
knowledge
to
show
that
real
prejudice
would
--
would
result
from
--
or
did
result
from
your
--
from
the
failure
to
make
that
available
at
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
i
don't
mean
in
argument.
i
mean,
did
you
make
a
motion
saying
you
now
know
there
are
things
of
this
non-disclosed
document
which
are
important
to
bring
before
a
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
understand
you
said
it
was
error
but
did
you
affirmatively
say,
on
the
knowledge
would
you
--
which
was
given
to
you
in
the
court
of
appeals,
you
are
now
in
the
position
to
show
either
that
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
new
trial
should
be
had
or
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
there,
you
could
move.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
when
you
appealed
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
you
appealed,
when
you
perfected
your
appeal,
you
did
not
know
the
contents
of
the
document,
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
afterwards,
you
did
know
the
contents
of
the
document
and
my
question
is
whether,
on
the
basis
of
that
knowledge,
having
been
put
in
possession
of
a
content,
it
might
demonstratively
show
that
you
suffered
for
not
having
been
allowed
to
produce
that
document
before
a
jury.
you
should
now
on
attack
and
not
on
mere
legal
argument
be
allowed
to
go
before
a
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
couldn't
ignore
what
the
court
of
appeals
with
judge
magruder
and
judge
hartigan
and
judge
--
who
was
the
third?
woodbury
would
have
done,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
that
you
couldn't
have
known
what
they
would
have
done
if
you
said
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
"having
now
this
knowledge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
ask
that
i
be
given
an
opportunity
to
present
this
grievance
wrong
to
my
client
to
the
jury,"
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it's
the
fact
that
you
didn't
do
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
position
--
your
position
would
be
the
same,
would
it
not,
if
there
had
been
no
other
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
not
going
to
announce
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
now
implying
that
you're
agreeing
with
your
associate
that
there
was
something
skullduggery
about
the
government's
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
you're
disagreeing
with
your
associate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
very
common
thing
for
--
it's
a
very
common
thing
for
people
--
when
people
write
out
a
statement
to
--
to
destroy
the
underlying
document.
mr.
secretary
gives
his
whole
diary
based
on
that
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
o'donnell,
i'd
like
to
say
this.
i
don't
know
a
thing
about
it
but
i'd
like
to
know
on
the
basis
of
what
facts
i'm
to
decide
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
one
thing
for
me
in
a
very
serious
case
to
suggest
or
to
--
to
proffer
to
this
court,
to
submit
to
this
court
a
case
even
on
fragile
testimony
of
skullduggery
by
the
prosecution.
no
one
feels
most
strongly
about
that,
no
one
could
feel
most
strongly
about
that
than
i
do.
it's
a
very
different
thing
to
have
it
disavowed
and
then
to
have
co-counsel
trot
it
out
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
lawyer
before
this
court,
you
have
to
take
a
position
not
as
a
--
what
the
flavor
is
and
as
a
rational
being,
you
either
take
the
position
or
you
don't
take
the
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
colleague
took
one
position,
you
take
another.
you're
free
to
do
so
because
you
represent,
i
take
it,
a
different
client.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
still
a
different
que
--
alright,
that's
a
question
of
law.
i
understand
that
quite
clearly.
but
whether
you
do
or
do
not
charge
the
government
with
wrongdoing
is,
to
me,
vital
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
well
understand
the
legal
proposition
doesn't
make
any
difference.
you
won't
discuss
it,
but
you
did
discuss
it
and
you
did
make
the
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
explicitly
disavowed
wrongdoing
by
the
government
in
an
answer
to
a
question
by
me.
he
explicitly
disavowed
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right
in
--
in
saying
that
the
crux
of
your
argument
will
be
that
your
argument
reducibly
fell
to
this.
that
if
a
man
makes
a
statement
or
if
they
comes
into
existing
statement,
which
is
producible
under
the
jencks
statute
and
that
statement
is
lost
for
the
most
honest
of
reasons,
the
person
whose
statement
it
is
cannot
be
utilized
as
a
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
be
of
acquiescence,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
make
--
if
it's--
if,
according
to
your
argument,
i
see
no
difference
how
the
non-availability
of
the
document
is
brought
about,
whether
through
carelessness,
except
--
except
purposeful
design
to
defeat
the
ends
of
the
law.
and
that's
what
my
question
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
document
is
--
ceases
to
be,
for
the
most
unassailable
reason,
the
witness
--
the
person
whose
--
with
reference
to
whom
the
statement
is
made
that
is
no
longer
producible
cannot
be
availed
of
the
witness
by
the
adverse
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
difficult,
mr.
connor.
am
i
wrong
in
--
in
having
inferred
from
your
--
what
you
regard
as
the
--
the
correct
question
before
the
court
that
the
--
the
assumption
of
that
question,
presupposition
is
that
the
government
assumed
that
if
the
notes
had
been
in
existence
that
staula
gave,
they
were
produced.
they
would
have
been
produced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
your
questioning.
i
must
say,
it
doesn't
mean
--
it
isn't
--
if
i
can
read
english,
to
say
the
question
is
whether
the
notes
of
an
interview
which
the
witness
testified
had
been
read
back
to
him
and
might
have
been
signed
by
him
were
not
in
existence
at
the
time
they
filed,
the
court
should
have
directed
that
they'll
be
turned
over
to
defend
for
later
report
by
the
government
agent
which
the
witness
testified
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
account.
now,
on
the
context
of
the
subject
matter,
there
is
a
differentiation,
just
the
position
between
notes
that
have
been
read
back
to
him,
which
might
have
been
signed
by
him
and
a
document,
a
later
document,
not
being
a
substantially
verbatim
account
of
what
he
had
told.
i
don't
see
why
the
government
doesn't
start
out
with
the
first
point
then.
number
one,
the
notes
originally
were
not
producible
because
they
were
not
subject
to
the
jencks
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
what
you
say
anywhere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
read
it
for
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
what
i
read
it
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
means
to
me,
the
--
that
--
the
implication
is
clear
that
if
the
notes
that
were
not
in
existence
had
been
in
existence,
they
were
not
challenged
to
be
non-producible.
i
must
--
i
must
say
it's
very
strange
english.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
is
so
only
on
the
assumption
that
the
notes
always
come
within
the
scope
of
the
palermo
--
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course,
the
word
"notes"
and
the
conception
of
notes
is
itself
a
very
ambiguous
term
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
the
record
that
has
come
before
this
court
entirely
here.
there
are
any
number
of
instances
where
the
fbi
takes
a
coherent
consecutive
statement
and
the
man
is
trying
to
draw
an
issue
of
it.
i
wouldn't
call
those
notes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they're
not
only
--
these
notes
often
are
also
interluded
with
comment
by
the
agent.
how
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
make
comments
that
this
fellow,
"i
don't
believe
him"
and
so
on,
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
wanted
is
the
authentication.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
were
they
talking
about?
i
don't
understand
why
--
it
isn't
axiomatically
to
me
that
what
toomey
could
have
testified
wasn't
admissible
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
right
--
i
don't
know
what
the
conflict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
want
to
know
what
this
footnote
is
about.
what
were
they
talking
about
in
chambers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know.
what
was
the
subject
matter?
what
was
--
why
did
they
adjourn
to
the
judge's
chambers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
demand
for
--
for
what
you
had
called
us
for
a
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
agreed
to
call
the
non
--
of
the
nonexistence
or
not
available
document
notes
and
the
document
which
is
in
existence
a
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
report
of
interview.
just
to
--
i
want
to
differentiate
the
two.
what
was
being
discussed
in
chambers,
whether
the
report
of
interview
should
be
--
should
be
produced?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
want
to
know
why
agent
toomey
was
--
why
judge
mccarthy
said
he
couldn't
be
called.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
just
--
justice
brennan
just
indicates,
he
certainly
could
be
called
to
testify
whether
the
so-called
notes
were
read
and
supplied
to
or
rather
signed
by
the
petitioner,
couldn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
doubt
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
couldn't
have
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
they
talking
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
he
told
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
that
he
didn't
sign
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
but
this
is
--
this
is
a
preliminary
inquiry
as
whether
certain
documents
should
be
produced.
we're
not
before
the
jury
at
the
moment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
--
we
are
in
the
judge's
chamber
who's
to
decide
whether
a
call
for
document
should
be
heeded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
and
on
that
issue,
i
don't
understand
why
toomey
wasn't
avail
--
or
wasn't
an
admissible
witness
in
that
preliminary
inquiry
before
judge
mccarthy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
--
i
can't
tell
from
this
footnote
what
--
what
it's
all
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
would
have
to
read,
at
least
i
would
have
to
read,
what's
repeated,
what
--
how
this
conference
to
which
footnote
on
this
page
occurs,
what
it
was
about
and
what
it
is
that
judge
mccarthy
had
in
mind
when
he
said,
"you
couldn't
call
the
agent
to
give
evidence."
of
course,
you
couldn't
call
him
up
to
give
evidence
as
to
what,
what's
his
name?
it's
all
about
said
but
--
but
what
we're
concerned
with
here
is
the
circumstances
that
brought
the
original
writings
of
the
agent
into
light
and
secondly,
what
kind
of
things
they
were,
whether
they
were
within
the
--
the
jencks
act
or
not.
and
assuming
they
were
within
the
jencks
statute
and
they're
not
being
forthcoming,
whether
you
could
then
--
whether
the
defendant
could
then
call
for
the
report
of
the
interview.
it
was
a
very
different
question.
they
can't
be
all
mixed
up
that
you
could
ask
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
misconceive
this
whole
case
and
i
may
well
have
misconceived
it.
if
i
--
if
it
isn't
a
fact
that
it
was
conceded
or
assumed
that
what
was
originally
recorded
by
the
agent
was
no
longer
in
existence,
that
on
the
basis
of
what
is
recorded,
he,
after,
would
make
a
report
which
was
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
the
shooting
is
about
--
all
the
shooting
is
about
is
the
production
of
that
report
or
striking
the
testimony
for
failure
to
produce
it.
isn't
that
what
the
case
is
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
included
in
my
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
can
assume
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
can
assume
throughout
that
the
original
documentation
is
gone.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
underlying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
assumption?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
you
call
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
call
them
whatever.
they're
gone.
there's
no
controversy
about
they
having
been
withheld
but
the
controversy
is
the
consequences
of
their
non-availability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
you
didn't
read
what
the
case
was
about
but
--
but
now,
you
--
you
destroy
my
belief
that
was
clear.
you
--
you
suggest
now
that
it
wasn't
sufficiently
shown
that
the
original
document
were
not
available.
i
thought
you'd
agree
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that,
if
they
were
not
producible,
if
they
were
not
compellable
under
the
jencks
statute,
certainly,
and
then
we
wouldn't
be
compellable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
did
it
develop
that
there
was
in
existence
this
report
that
is
in
existence?
how
did
that
come
up?
how
did
that
come?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
it
printed
at?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
turn
to
that
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
page
12?
justice
felix
frankfurter
212?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is,
how
did
the
existence
of
that
--
how
did
the
existence
of
that
disclosed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
page?
i'd
like
to
see
it
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
answers
the
chief
justice's
question
and
mine.
i
don't
think
it
ever
came
out
explicitly
that
the
original
so-called
note
was
not
available,
except
he
clearly
hasn't
got
them
but
he
produces
this.
and
that's
why
i
say
the
presupposition
is
the
assumption
of
everybody
was
that
they
weren't
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he's
quite
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
an
assistant
--
he's
an
assistant
us
attorney
of
a
lower
rank.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
mr.
connor,
this
must
have
--
something
must
have
been
said
about
this
before
that,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
"you
see,
mr.
hurly,"
and
he
said
he
was
a
--
so
that,
it
was
--
if
that
is
the
transcript
on
page
201,
mr.
hurly,
"it
isn't.
it
is
a
report
for
an
fbi
agent
which
is
a
summary
of
the
result
of
the
interview.
it
is
his
interpretation
of
what
happened."
in
other
words,
that's
the
second
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
the
present
controversy
that's
involved.
they
wanted
--
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
wanted
this
produced
or
the
evidence
stricken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
but
--
but
there
must
have
been
--
wasn't
there
earlier
a
number
that
it
was
said
to
the
judge
that
"no,
we
can't
produce
that
but
we
can
produce
this,"
wasn't
there
anything
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
is
why
i
said,
for
me,
throughout
this
proceeding,
there
was
an
assumption
by
everybody
that
the
original
documentation
by
toomey
was
not
available
but
they
then
offered
this
subsequent
reporting,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
connor,
i
have
started
to
look
through
this
transcript.
it
begins
on
page
1790
and
as
far
as
i've
gone
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
several
times,
the
united
states
representative
said
explicitly,
"i'm
requested
to
produce
a
non-existing
document."
he
said
that
two
or
three
times,
which
isn't
challenged
or
questioned
or
in
doubt
or
--
or
seen
as
the
odium
thrown
upon
it.
but
i
can't
tell
--
what
precedes
1790?
i
can't
tell
what
documents
they're
talking
about.
the
judge
is
a
notoriously
defused
talker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
can't
tell
what
they
were
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
i
--
where
is
the
rest
of
the
transcript?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
this
begins
at
1790
and
this
is
taking
place
in
the
absence
of
a
jury.
so,
something
must
have
happened
which
provokes
this
chamber
proceeding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
don't
you
tell
me,
i
want
to
know
where
i
can
get
the
stenographic
minutes
of
what
happened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
they're
talking
about
in
these
--
in
these
stenographic
minutes
are
what
we're
talking
about
here,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
clear
as
a
bell
that
everybody
assumed.
it
was
stated
explicitly
in
plain
unequivocal
english
that
the
documents,
originally,
whatever
they
--
their
nature
was,
were
not
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
counsel
can't
stand
by
and
allow
such
a
statement
made
by
u.s.
attorney
and
if
they
question
it
in
their
minds
not
to
put
their
questions
on
their
tongues.
so,
there
wasn't
any
doubt
about
it
that
they
were
not
in
existence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whatever
was
taken
down
by
toomey.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
things
that
are
clear,
two
things
about
which
they
ought
not
to
be
a
dispute
in
anybody's
mind
when
we
arrive
here
tonight
is,
one,
there
was
an
original
writing
by
toomey
which
was,
when
asked
to
be
produced,
non-existent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
secondly,
that
there
was
a
report
by
the
agent
based
on
those
original
--
on
that
original
writing
which
is
concededly
not
within
the
jencks
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
--
then,
the
doubts
that
are
raised
is
not
the
doubts,
but
you
say
that
since
the
defendant
was
asked
for
the
production
of
a
document,
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
come
within
the
condition
for
the
production
laid
down
by
the
jencks
statute.
and
you
say
further
that
those
--
that
they
have
not
made
good
that
requirement
of
them
to
--
to
have
that
document
produced
were
it
in
existence
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
essential
before
they
come
to
the
next
point,
namely
since
it
isn't
in
existence,
the
next
best
thing
should
be
given
to
them
or
at
least,
if
not,
the
evidence
of
the
witness'
about
and
this
controversy
struggles
should
be
stricken.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
--
that
sums
it
all
up,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
ever
suggest
anywhere,
anywhere
before
this
answer,
not
that
you
suggested
now,
did
you
ever
suggest
anywhere
either,
one,
that
there
might
have
been
wrongdoing
or
two,
that
this
is
a
nice
way
for
the
government
to
get
out
of
the
jencks
case?
did
you
ever
suggest
that
anywhere?
could
i
find
it
in
your
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
my
belief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
it's
my
belief
to
that.
but
did
you
ever
suggest
anywhere,
you
never
threw
the
slightest
spec
of
dust
on
the
wrongdoing
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
point
was
that
it
was
immaterial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't
it?
your
point
was
that
it's
immaterial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
what
mr.
o'donnell
said
at
the
bottom
of
this
court.
mr.
o'donnell
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
regards
to
wrongdoing
and
you
specifically
disavowed
it
when
i
put
it
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
associate
had
suggested
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
associate
had
suggested
in
words
explicitly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
we
ought
to
be
slow
in
making
charges
against
even
government
people,
unless
there's
some
(inaudible).
