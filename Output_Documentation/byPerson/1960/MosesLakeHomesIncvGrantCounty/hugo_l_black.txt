justice

l.
black
did
they
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
you
could
state
very
briefly
what
would
happen
to
your
client
if
this
case
is
dismissed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
whether
it's
raised.
what
i
want
to
know,
what
happens
to
your
client
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
this
case
was
decided
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
tax
now
do
you
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much
is
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
what
would
it
be
if
they
had
assessed
you
on
the
basis
that
they
assess
other
people
who
do
not
apply
leaseholds
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
understand
your
claim,
is
it
this,
that
in
--
in
the
state
of
washington,
they
assess
only
the
equitable
value
to
some
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
of
a
leasehold.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
the
value
less
the
mortgage.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
mortgage?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
much?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what's
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what's
the
assess
valuation
that
washington
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
position
you
took
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
deny
that
they
decided
this
on
the
right
bench.
you
denied
that
there's
a
discrimination
which
they
said
there
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
that
the
--
i
hardly
said
there
was.
you
deny
that
the
--
there
was
a
discrimination
which
the
court
of
appeals
approved.
do
you
not
or
do
you
now?
did
they
not
say
that
there
was
this
discrimination?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
dollars
and
cents
but
didn't
they
say
that
the
one
you
took
account
of
the
equitable
ownership
and
the
other
you
didn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
true?
did
you
say
it
was
truth
before
--
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
did
they
decide
it
this
way
if
you
deny
that
and
the
others
asserted
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
going
to
defend
it
on
the
ground
as
different
to
those
you
stated
to
that
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
your
briefs
here
that
you
had
in
that
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
--
can
you
get
the
briefs
that
were
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
cannot
understand
how
they
possibly
could
decide
this
case
if
they
did,
if
you
had
presented
the
argument
you're
now
presenting.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
evidence
for
them
in
any
court
to
show
what
was
the
basis
on
which
you
imposed
this
in
connection
with
wherry
housing?
what
was
the
basis
on
which
you
imposed
if
you
claim
this
tax?
are
you
assessing
the
entire,
so
far
as
they're
concerned,
are
you
assessing
as
though
there
were
--
as
they
own
that,
which
they
have
conveyed
by
mortgage
interest
to
somebody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
that
for
homeowners?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
it
for
everybody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
if
that's
--
that's
true
i'm
wondering
why
the
court
decided
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
an
insurance
company
or
bank
would
be
precisely
the
same.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
you
think
it's
a
moot
case?
you
say
grant
county
doesn't
expect
to
get
a
dollar
because
of
the
new
statute
which
allows
the
government
to
offset
for
services
against
your
tax.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
statute
simply
provides
that
so
far
as
taxes
are
concerned,
as
i
gather
your
statute,
as
far
as
taxes
are
concerned,
the
government
can
offset
certain
services.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
can't
collect
from
here
except
as
an
offset
against
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
with
a
basis
fee,
i
think,
they
don't
want
you
to
keep
any
taxes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
are
not
willing
to
make
you
pay
for
those
services.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
statute
cited
there
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
one
related
to
the
services?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
claim
get
into
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
county
filed
it
in
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
ask
the
court
to
pass
on
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
say
--
they
say
that
you
have
had
this
adjudicated
against
you
in
the
state
court.
is
that
true?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
they
took
a
different
position.
i
thought
your
brief
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
i
understood.
