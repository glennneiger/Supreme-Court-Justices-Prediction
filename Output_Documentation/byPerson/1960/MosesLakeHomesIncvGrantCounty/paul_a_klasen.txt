mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
i
disagree
with
mr.
iverson.
and
the
--
a
--
a
different
standard
is
not
applied
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
general
rule
was
announced
by
the
moses
lake
homes
versus
grant
county
at
51
wash.2d.
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
denied
there
was
any
discrimination
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
the
court
below
merely
stated
that
a
different
method
of
valuation
was
used
for
wherry
housing,
and
that
they
did
not
say
that
in
such
in
dollars
and
cents,
there
was
any
discrimination.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right.
i
did.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
i
cannot
explain
the
reasoning
of
the
circuit
court
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
--
under
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
they're
very
similar,
the
same
articles
--
i
--
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
we
can.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well,
it
appears
to
grant
county
that
the
court
merely
on
its
--
had
so
to
speak
on
--
on
the
res
judicata
issue
and
since
that
would
apply,
they
went
on
to
the
other
matter.
they
did
not
discuss
the
arguments
that
we
raised
that
the
same
arguments
that
were
used
in
the
offutt
housing
cases
that
you
can
carry,
at
least,
a
part
to
look
at
the
practical
effect
of
the
lease
rather
than
follow
the
mere
designation
of
lessee
or
lessor.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
generally
speaking,
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
--
under
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
no,
he
will
not.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
i
--
i
did
not.
that
was
the
question
that
--
though
the
assessments
are
never
made
on
real
property
in
my
home
on
the
basis
of
the
mortgage
so
on
the
valuation
of
the
home
as
if
the
mortgage
did
not
exist.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
from
my
house,
that's
--
that's
the
way
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
it
would
be.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
not
exactly,
your
honor.
in
the
washington
case
where
they
decided
the
--
the
leasehold
or
the
valuation,
the
court
said
that
because
the
improvements
did
not
last
the
link
of
the
term
of
the
lease
and
other
factors
that
--
for
that
--
on
that
basis,
the
rule
in
the
state
of
washington
is
that
you
do
not
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
mortgage
value,
the
mortgage
against
the
property.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
a
normal
lease,
yes,
where
the
improvements
would
last
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
--
beyond
the
link
of
the
term
of
the
lease.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
we
do
not
want
to
do
that
in
a
wherry
housing
because
the
improvements
do
not
last
in
term
of
the
lease.
the
court
did
not
go
into
the
distinctions
at
all
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right.
our
state
supreme
court
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
in
order
to
determine
actually
the
value
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well
--
grant
county
isn't
really
too
much
concern
with
it
because
of
a
new
section
of
--
section
511
of
the
housing
act
is
going
to,
probably,
for
all
practical
purpose,
wipe
out
the
taxes.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
in
addition,
your
honor,
the
--
the
court
awarded
grant
county
some
$90,000
in
taxes,
irrespective
of
--
of
the
remand,
for
three
years
1955,
1956
and
1957.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
the
--
the
ninth
--
court
--
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
--
a
different
method
was
used
but
on
--
on
the
basis
of
res
judicata
that
the
matter
was
foreclosed
to
them.
that
this
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well,
it
had
to
be
for
1958
and
for
1956
and
1957
for
larsonaire
--
larsonaire
homes
and
i
think
1957
for
larson
heights.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
i
don't
know
how
they're
going
to
do
it,
but
i
would
imagine
they're
going
to
have
to
--
go
into
some
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
none
in
particular.
no.
if
the
court
please,
the
reason
we're
not
objecting
to
it
is
because
of
the
law.
the
final
result
will
mean
nothing
to
grant
county
probably.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well,
the
reason
we
are
not
objecting
to
the
--
the
remanding
back
is
because
of
section
511
of
the
--
amended
the
wherry
housing
act.
grant
county
probably
will
realize
little
or
nothing
when
the
case
is,
in
fact,
in
the
district
court
for
reevaluation.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well,
because
the
secretary
of
the
air
force,
under
section
511,
has
claimed
that
they
have
offset
the
taxes
by
granting
services
which
be
--
would
be
covered
under
the
taxes.
and
therefore,
since
the
services
will
exceed
the
taxes
under
the
amendment
of
congress,
they
can
offset
services
against
the
tax
and
the
air
force
comes
up
with
services
overweighed
when
above
the
tax.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well,
whenever
we're
optimistic,
i'll
put
it
that
way
to
mean
but
we're
not
very
hopeful.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right.
the
off
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
well,
the
outset
applied
only
to
taxes
that
came
on
lien
after
1956.
these
taxes
here
are
for
taxes
before
the
offset
provision
came
applicable
of
that
amount
grant
county
has
received
from
the
depository,
i
think,
$50,000,
and
we
have
not
yet
collected
the
amount
awarded
to
us
in
addition
by
the
ninth
--
ninth
circuit.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
no,
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
--
no,
we
will
not,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
--
united
states
said
to
congress.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
no,
no,
no,
they
can't
--
no,
they
cannot
go
back
against
the
county.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
the
section
is
511.
it's
cited
in
the
--
in
the
record
at
section
511
of
the
--
it's
in
the
circuit
court's
opinion,
i
guess,
opinion
to
the
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it's
on
the
record,
page
349.
grant
county's
position
is
based
on
the
offutt
housing
cases.
in
addition,
the
statute
to
which
circuit
court
of
appeals
didn't
pay
too
much
attention
to
it
at
least
as
far
as
we
can
see
is
that
personal
property
includes
all
improvements
upon
lands,
the
fee
of
which
is
vested
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
state.
and
that's
the
basis
upon
which
the
property
was
assessed
as
improvements
upon
land,
the
fee
which
is
--
is
vested
in
the
united
states
or
the
state
of
washington.
now,
in
the
offutt
housing
cases,
the
court
has
ruled
that
you
can
go
be
--
look
as
to
the
substance,
not
really
is
the
form
of
the
lease,
you
can
go
behind
the
terms
and
look
as
the
practical
aspect
and
the
cases
of
which
the
wherry
housing
cases
can
be
distinguished
from
the
metropolitan
building
cases
because
in
those
cases,
one,
there
is
no
--
that
the
improvements,
last
way
beyond
the
term
of
the
lease.
the
amount
of
compensation
is
entirely
different.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
not
--
not
precisely.
there
was
a
question
whether
the
--
the
taxes
could
be
levied.
but
the
nebraska
tax
law
are
similar
to
this
washington
tax
law
and
the
very
same
issues
are
raised.
the
metropolitan
building
cases
were
cited
in
briefs
presented
in
the
offutt
housing
cases.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
it
wasn't
argued
as
such,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
the
manner
of
the
taxes
has
been
determined
in
moses
lake
homes
versus
grant
county
in
51
wash.
2d
285
in
which
these
very
taxes
were
upheld
and
the
petitioner
here
did
not
see
fit
to
seek
review
from
this
court.
and
the
--
as
stated
in
grubb
versus
ohio
public
utilities
that
the
state
court,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
land
having
determined
the
issue
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
raise
the
matter.
petitioner
is
not
entitled
to
raise
it
again
in
--
in
another
federal
court.
the
same
question
as
to
res
judicata
was
in
the
grubb
versus
public
service
of
ohio.
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
has
done
nothing
in
relying
on
these
taxes.
he
has
never
listed
his
property
as
the
law
requires
him
to
do.
he's
never
done
as
in
the
metropolitan
cases
come
in
and
shown
what
the
value
of
the
property
is.
in
other
words,
he
says,
"you
might
be
$10,000"
but
they
have
never
said
what
the
valuation
of
the
property
should
be
as
--
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
you
go
before
the
county
board
of
equalization.
they
have
a
hearing
every
year
when
the
assessments
were
equalized.
if
you
don't
like
the
decision
of
the
county
board,
you
can
appeal
to
the
state
board.
and
if
you
don't
like
the
decision
of
the
state
board,
the
law
says,
“you
had
to
pay
the
tax
under
protest
and
sue
to
be
covered.”
mr.
paul
a.
klasen,
jr.
i
don't
see
--
those
are
the
remedies
as
prescribed
by
law.
i
know
of
no
way
in
the
state
of
washington
where
it
can
be
done.
thank
you.
