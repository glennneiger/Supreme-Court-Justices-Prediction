justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
in
greater
detail
the
effect,
namely,
what
it
is
before
you
get
to
the
holding,
what
it
is
and
who
is
--
what
it
is
that
was
taxed
against
whom
it
was
taxed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
financial
relations
and
so
forth.
have
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
75-year
old
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
leasehold.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
iverson,
your
complaining
here
that
this
wherry's
interest
attached
at
--
the
base
of
the
rate,
the
base
rate
of
wherry
property
is
higher
than
the
base
rate
of
other
taxable
properties
in
washington,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
since
your
supreme
court
interpreted
the
offutt
decisions
the
way
it
did,
has
there
been
any
decision
by
your
court
that
they
wouldn't
be
equally
applied
at
measuring
throughout
the
non-wherry
interests?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
we
tell
that
they
haven't
changed
their
mind
and
therefore,
you've
been
treated,
and
tomorrow
they
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
judged
by
the
prior
rulings
of
your
statement
reenforce
the
application
for
the
--
the
basis
of
taxation
in
this
assessment
of
this
case
operates
discriminatorily.
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
non
(inaudible)
that
today,
they
wouldn't
measure
it
by
the
same
equal
hand
as
non-wherry
property?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
have
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
they
do
with
that
in
the
case
in
which
they
applied
offutt?
they
say
as
to
we
now
have
the
green
light
from
the
supreme
court
but
as
to
wherry
taxation,
we
can
--
we
can
dodge
them
all
or
we
can
in
local
taxation.
did
they
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
mean
the
effect.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
maybe
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
candidly
said
a
minute
ago
that
it's
applied
to
the
same
standard
for
non-wherry
property
you
couldn't
make
a
claim
of
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
have
here
is
the
ninth
circuit
case,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
where
is
that,
mr.
iverson?
where
do
they
say
that?
and
do
they
justify
it
on
the
ground
you
can
do
this
to
wherry
but
not
to
other
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
decision
said
in
the
light
of
offutt,
each
state
--
that
the
interest
of
national
uniformity
that
the
wherry
act
permits
this
discrimination.
and
that's
what
you're
saying.
that's
what
you
say
the
court
held,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
going
to
give
you
--
i've
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i've
said
what
i
said
to
give
you
a
time
to
point
us
to
that
finding.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
if
we
--
it
turns
out
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
we
made
--
if
we
brought
in
a
question
that
turns
out
to
be
abstract,
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
aspect,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
didn't
say
we
have,
i
say
if
we
have
brought
in
abstract
questions
which
we
don't
have
to
decide
in
this
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
please,
would
you
mind
stating
at
the
outset
whether
you
challenge
or
agree
with
mr.
iverson
that
this
one
non-wherry
property,
exactly
the
same
situation,
there
would
be
a
different
standard,
a
different
basis
on
ratings
against
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
want
to
--
of
course,
you
got
a
judgment
in
your
favor.
and
i
am
answering
to
your
answer
to
justice
black's
question
to
mean
that
you're
going
to
defend
this
judgment
on
grounds
other
than
those
on
which
the
court
gave
you
the
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
for
non-wherry
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
justice
black,
that
he
wasn't
interested
in
dollars
and
cents.
i
like
to
be
interested.
he
had
some
other
purpose.
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
suppose
you
had
the
identical
situation
you
have
here,
the
exact
interest
created,
the
same
75-year
term,
the
same
mortgage,
everything
the
same,
except
the
financing
was
not
done
through
the
--
through
the
government,
it
was
done
through
private
lease.
would
the
assessment
be
the
same
for
my
--
the
case
that
i
put
you,
the
hypothetical
case
as
it
was
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
you
do
that
in
a
wherry
act
situation
that
the
ninth
circuit
distinguished?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
the
practical
differences,
the
nature
of
the
lease
in
a
wherry
situation
is
different
from
the
case
in
which
your
state
court
applied
the
doctrine
that
it
applies,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
if
that's
so
but
that's
what
you're
saying,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
practical
difference,
you're
dealing
with
different
interest,
if
an
incident
of
--
of
value,
is
that
right?
