justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
mean
--
do
you
mean
to
say,
if
i
own
a
house
in
a
lot
in
your
state,
then
it's
subject
to
mortgage
now
in
fee
that
your
assessor
will
deduct
an
amount
of
the
outstanding
mortgage
in
the
assessment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
in
that,
what
mr.
justice
black
was
asking
you.
i
don't
think
you
understood
his
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
are
you
--
i
don't
know
what
you
mean.
isn't
it
true
that
one
thing
is
that
(inaudible)
mortgages
are
not
ordinarily
deducted
in
determining
the
asset
value
yet
because
of
the
offutt
case,
it's
--
no,
no,
but
if
this
were
only
done
with
respect
to
leasings
but
because
of
the
offutt
case,
we
will
not
do
it
in
a
wherry
act
situation,
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let's
just
take
a,
b,
c.
you
did
have
a
lease,
a
normal
lease
in
your
state,
do
you
ordinarily
permit
deduction
of
the
mortgage
against
it
in
determining
assessed
valuation
of
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
not
true
that
the
offutt
case
did
not
involve
a
question
of
discrimination
which
is
the
attack
of
petitioner
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
it
was
true
that
in
the
offutt
case,
nebraska
assessed
all
personal
property
at
the
same
basis,
namely,
its
fair
value,
and
it
treated
this
wherry
act
leasehold
as
personal
property,
and
there
was
no
element
of
discrimination
involved
in
that
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
is
res
judicata
in
this
instance?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
will
also
make
some
questions
if
you
raise
some
questions
upon
failure
of
the
petitioner
to
exhaust
his
state
permit
with
relevance
to
valuation,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
what
does
your
law
require
to
me
if
i
owned
a
leasehold
in
your
state
to
do
with
respect
to
taxes
if
an
assessment
was
made
of
x
dollars
and
i
don't
like
it,
what
do
i
do?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
bypass
those
procedures?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
be
invalid
simply
because
the
valuation
maybe
accessible?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
iverson,
is
it
not
true
that
the
discrimination
of
which
you
complained
relates
not
to
rate
of
tax
but
to
value?
