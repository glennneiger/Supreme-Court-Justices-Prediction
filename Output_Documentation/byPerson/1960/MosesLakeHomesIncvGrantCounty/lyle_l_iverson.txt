mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
this
is
an
action
involving
an
application
by
grant
county,
washington
to
impress
upon
the
deposit
of
estimated
compensation
in
a
condemnation
case
alleged
tax
liabilities
or
taxes
against
a
leasehold.
now,
all
that
we
have
in
the
condemnation
case
is
a
condemnation
of
a
leasehold,
not
a
condemnation
of
buildings.
this
case
involves
what
is
known
as
a
wherry
housing
project.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
a
wherry
housing
project.
it
arises
under
title
viii
of
the
federal
housing
act
and
a
wherry
housing
act
--
wherry
housing
project
operates
this
way.
on
a
military
reservation,
a
lease
is
given
for
a
period
of
75
years
and
the
--
the
sponsor
that
is
--
that's
the
terminology,
the
sponsor
corporation
erects
the
buildings
and
then
leases
them
to
tenants
assigned
by
the
military
commander
for
that
period
of
75
years.
he
is
financed
by
an
fha
guaranteed
loan.
now,
in
this
case,
grant
county
levied
taxes
against
this
property.
in
their
listing
of
the
property,
they
designated
it
as
buildings
on
the
military
reservation.
actually,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
had
some
discussion
of
this
question,
and
the
court
has
held
that
notwithstanding
that
they
designated
buildings,
that
they
were
really
trying
to
tax
the
leasehold.
but
the
court,
the
circuit
court
held
that
this
--
some
of
this
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
yes.
we
have
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
if
the
court
please.
we
have
three
corporations
here,
each
which
has
a
separate
wherry
housing
project,
and
they
have
these
75-year
leases.
grant
county,
washington
in
--
in
which
moses
lake
--
larson
air
force
base
is
located,
undertook
to
assess
personal
property
taxes
against
these
buildings.
now,
by
the
terms
of
the
lease,
which
rendered
for
75
years,
buildings
immediately
upon
construction
became
the
property
of
the
federal
government,
and
grant
county
undertook
to
assess
the
leasehold
upon
the
basis.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
that's
correct,
your
honor
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
upon
the
basis
of
the
valuation
of
the
buildings.
now,
we
have
approximately
$6
million
in
mortgages
outstanding
against
the
property.
they
assessed
the
property
at
a
figure
which
if
we
disregard
equalization
figures
and
so
forth
would
--
would
put
these
--
put
the
market
value
at
approximately
$2
million.
now,
the
government,
in
condemning
this
property,
paid
in
as
estimated
compensation,
$253,000.
grant
county
sought
to
obtain
actually
more
money
than
the
total
amount
paid
in
by
the
federal
government.
the
lower
court,
in
this
case
--
the
application
was
made
by
grant
county
to
impress
their
tax
lien
against
this
estimated
compensation
on
the
ground
that
the
--
that
a
lien
rested
against
the
leasehold,
therefore,
the
estimated
compensation
being
substituted
for
the
lien
and
became
substituted
for
the
estimated
compensation.
the
lower
court
found
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
concurred
in
the
finding
that
the
proceeding
followed
by
grant
county
in
this
matter
was
discriminatory
against
a
contractor
with
the
federal
government.
now,
this
is
the
reason
for
that
holding
in
washington.
we
have
a
statute
that
provides,
this
is
r.c.w.
84.40.030,
it's
cited
in
my
brief
and
it's
in
the
appendix,
"taxable
leasehold
estate
shall
be
valued
at
such
price
as
they
would
bring
at
a
fair
voluntary
sale
for
cash."
now,
you
know
of
taxable
leaseholds.
they're
especially
--
they're
especially
covered
by
statute.
in
a
long
line
of
cases
in
washington
known
as
the
metropolitan
building
company
cases,
the
washington
supreme
court
has
construed
that
statute
with
respect
to
all
leaseholds
held
from
the
state.
and
in
those
cases,
which
involved
state-owned
land
in
the
heart
of
seattle
under
50-year
leases,
it
was
sought
by
the
public
authorities
to
tax
them
upon
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
improvements
on
the
property
rather
than
the
value
of
the
leasehold
as
someone
would
buy
it
and
let
someone
would
pay
for
it,
and
that
--
those
contentions
were
rejected
four
times
by
the
washington
supreme
court.
and
i
set
out
the
cases
in
my
brief.
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
in
washington,
in
taxing
a
leasehold,
the
leasehold
must
be
taxed
on
its
--
on
a
reasonable
market
value
what
a
willing
seller
--
what
a
willing
--
what
a
willing
seller
could
obtain
from
a
willing
buyer
considering
the
burdens
and
benefits.
and
the
court
said
that
a
purchaser
would
take
it
(inaudible).
and
that
if
there
was
a
large
mortgage
against
the
property
that
that
mortgage
would
be
taken
into
consideration,
and
the
method
of
taxing
all
leaseholds
in
washington,
all
other
leaseholds
in
washington,
is
well-established
and
that
is
what
would
a
willing
buyer
to
take
--
pay
to
a
willing
seller,
considering
the
encumbrances,
the
burdens
and
benefits.
now,
when
we
got
to
this
matter
of
the
wherry
housing
projects,
it
had
considerable
litigation
over
this
and
the
first
of
these
--
these
three
corporations
to
be
organized
were
moses
lake
homes,
inc.
and
moses
lake
homes,
inc.
obtained,
in
1954,
an
injunction
against
the
efforts
of
the
county
to
levy
upon
the
buildings
as
they
were
--
that's
what
they
were
listings,
the
buildings
which
were,
by
the
terms
of
the
lease,
government
property.
and
that
injunction
remained
in
effect
until
1957.
and
so
or
--
the
taxes
levied
in
1955,
1956,
1957
were
all
held
up
the
administrative
proceedings
while
that
injunction
was
in
effect.
then
about
that
time,
this
court
decided
a
case
served
as
the
warehousing
case,
offutt
housing
company
versus
sarpy
county,
which
is
cited
--
citations
in
the
brief,
in
which
this
court
held
that
in
nebraska,
a
wherry
housing
project
could
be
taxed
at
the
value
of
the
--
of
improvements
on
the
property
and
the
washington
court,
having
this
before
it,
rather
blindly
followed
that
decision
of
this
court
and
said
that
they
were
bound
by
the
--
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
and
so
forth
they
would
follow
the
decision
of
this
court
and,
therefore,
a
wherry
act
housing
project
in
washington
in
this
case
would
be
taxed
at
the
basis,
that
was
the
leasehold,
will
be
taxed
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
improvements.
now,
that
might
have
been
alright
in
nebraska,
but
in
washington,
that
is
precisely
what
the
washington
supreme
court,
in
the
metropolitan
building
company
cases,
had
repeatedly
held
could
not
be
done
in
one
of
the
cases
which
we
cite,
which
we
quote
in
it.
the
washington
court
held
in
so
many
words
that
it
was
not
permissible
for
the
public
authorities
to
take
the
value
of
the
improvements
and
use
those
as
the
sole
basis
for
determining
the
tax
liability.
now,
in
effect,
what
has
happened
has
been
that
for
wherry
housing
projects
only,
the
leasehold
is
taxed
not
as
the
statute
says
on
its
market
value
but
it's
taxed
on
the
value
of
the
improvements.
now,
you
see
what
kind
of
difference
that
makes.
that
is
the
difference
between
whether
we
take
about
$7
million
worth
of
houses
here
and
tax
or
whether
we
take
our
interest
in
them,
which
the
government
estimated
at
$253,000.
now,
in
counsel's
brief,
they
say
they
actually
did
not
ignore
the
burdens
on
this
leasehold.
now,
this
is
the
first
time
they've
said
that.
and
in
the
court
below,
in
answer
to
admissions,
which
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
they
specifically
admitted
that
they
did
not
take
into
consideration
the
$6
million
worth
of
mortgages.
it
is
the
difference
between
taxing
the
equity
of
the
lessee
and
the
property
and
taxing
the
property
itself.
if
you
count
up
what
they
have
actually
assessed,
if
we
--
i
think
any
court
in
washington
would
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
equalized
values
are
far
or
less
than
the
50%
they
--
that
they
seek
to
get
at
but
if
we
disregard
that
and
get
simply
to
the
--
to
the
value
that
they
have
put
on
it,
they
have
put
a
value
of
some
$2
million
on
this
property.
now,
we're
being
condemned.
we'd
be
awfully
happy
to
get
the
government
pass
$2
million
worth.
it
just
isn't
that
much
but
nobody's
going
to
pass
that
because
that
just
isn't
what
our
--
what
our
equity
is
worth
but
that's
what
we've
taxed
for.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
different
and
higher.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
no,
there
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
we
have
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
court
did
not
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
court
did
not
undertake
to
reverse
any
of
those
cases.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
court
has,
in
fairly
recent
times,
reaffirmed
that
long
line
of
decisions.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
well,
i
think
those
aren't
exactly
the
words,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that's
the
effect
of
it.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
i
think
what
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
about
what
they
said
was
that
we
are
going
to
make
this
uniform
throughout
the
country,
and
we
feel
that
we
are
guided
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
on
this.
now,
what
they've
failed
to
do
was
to
compare
it
with
what
they
were
doing
to
everything
else
and
in
addition
to
that
case,
to
--
to
all
that
long
line
of
cases,
we
also
have
a
statute
in
washington
which
has
not
been
repealed
or
modified,
and
that
statute
says
that
the
leasehold
shall
be
at
its
reasonable
--
at
its
market
value
on
a
fair
sale
for
cash.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
i
think
that's
right
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
in
the
world
that
they
never
have
and
that
nobody
has
contended
that
they're
going
to.
but
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
here,
they
certainly
did.
here,
they
applied
a
wholly
different
standard
in
--
in
a
wherry
act
case
which
has
come
since
this
one.
since
--
the
moses
lake
case
was
there,
second
case
involving
spokane
county
air
base
housing,
the
air
base
housing
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
here.
they
again
applied
this
discriminatory
method
insofar
as
wherry
housing
act
cases.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
ruling
of
our
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
that's
what
we've
taken
in
this
effort.
now,
both
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor,
and
the
--
the
lower
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
washington
did
in
fact
discriminate
against
the
wherry
act
projects.
now,
you
got
two
courts
below
have
decided
that
and
under
ordinary
rules,
where
two
courts
below
have
conferred
in
that.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
that's
right.
those
are
the
findings.
those
are
the
specific
findings
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
--
your
honor.
the
--
the
--
let's
see
if
i
can
get
the
--
the
reference
here
immediately.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
ever
said
that.
the
court
didn't
quite
come
to
that
point.
the
court
just
said
that
in
this
case
because
of
the
--
of
the
offutt
case,
we're
going
to
hold
it
that
way.
and
it
violated
--
it's
contrary
to
the
washington
statute
which
has
been
uniformally
applied
and
all
other
cases
and
it's
contrary
to
all
of
the
decisions
of
our
court
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
--
in
all
of
the
cases.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
well,
i
think
it
is
a
matter
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
--
i
think
it
is
--
as
the
matter
comes
up
on
the
--
on
the
writ,
it
is
assumed
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
making
its
finding
that
the
--
that
the
discrimination
did
exist.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
no.
i
think
we
don't
have
an
abstract
question
here.
the
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
--
the
--
on
page
354
of
the
record,
the
court
said,
this
is
the
circuit
court,
the
trial
court's
further
finding
that
a
different
method
was
used
in
(inaudible)
the
wherry
act
leaseholds
here
and
question
is
also
correct
likewise
to
be
sustained
as
the
court's
finding
that
the
method
used
in
assessing
the
moses
lake
leasehold
resulted
in
a
higher
tax
and
would
have
been
true
in
the
case
of
a
non-wherry
act
leasehold.
and
then
they
go
on
in
the
footnote
to
say
the
moses
lake
leasehold
was
heavily
encumbered
by
a
mortgage.
amortization
of
this
indebtedness
was
not
taken
into
account
in
assessing
the
leasehold.
it
was
only
the
value
of
the
physical
improvement
was
considered
but
has
the
valuation
of
the
leasehold
been
measured
by
its
market
value
considered
in
the
lights
of
its
burdens
and
benefits,
the
necessity
of
amortizing
the
mortgage
would
have
been
taken
into
account,
citing
some
cases,
had
been
taken
into
account
the
assessed
value
for
1958
and
therefore,
the
levied
tax
would
have
been
substantially
lower,
but
we
do
not
know
how
much
lower.
so
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
has
specifically
found
the
question
of
--
of
discrimination.
now,
that
leads
us
to
--
to
where
we
are.
here,
for
the
first
time
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
fact
that
now,
an
application
has
made
to
a
federal
court
--
to
--
and
its
processes
to
collect
a
discriminatory
tax
which
discriminates
against
the
federal
government.
now,
this
is
a
matter
which
is
just
inherit
in
courts,
but
they
do
not
assist
the
violation
of
the
laws
of
their
own
sovereignty.
this
court
in
that
case,
philips
chemical
company
versus
dumas
school
district,
which
is
cited
here,
has
not
too
long
ago,
very
explicitly
reaffirm
the
long-standing
rule
that
a
state,
in
taxing
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
government,
may
not
discriminate
against
them
and
pick
them
out
for
special
adverse
treatment.
and
that
is
what
has
occurred
here.
so
that
the
--
this
court
is
now
being
--
the
--
the
federal
courts
are
now
being
called
upon
in
this
condemnation
procedure
to
assist
the
county
in
collecting
from
the
--
from
this
estimated
compensation,
this
discriminatory
tax.
now,
it
had
the
theory
upon
which
--
the
county
proceedings,
apparently
is
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
leaseholds
are
for
a
period
of
75
years,
they
will
outlast
the
--
the
leaseholds
will
outlast
the
buildings.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
such
findings
that,
in
this
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
in
its
--
in
its
oral
opinion
indicated
that
since
the
--
the
contract
called
for
this
maintenance
reserves
and
replacements
that
this
would
be
maintained
on
to
the
end
of
the
term.
so
that
there
has
--
there
has
been
no
decision
that
there
is
any
conversion
of
this
property
from
a
leasehold
to
ownership.
and
in
washington,
we
have
a
case
which
we've
cited
in
here
which
holds
that
even
a
lease
for
999
years
doesn't
constitute
ownership.
and
if
it
be
considered
that
the
county
is
claiming
this
tax
against
the
physical
buildings,
then
i
don't
think
they
have
any
claim
against
the
--
the
positive
estimated
compensation
because
it
is
not
the
physical
buildings
that
the
government
is
condemning.
what
the
government
is
condemning
here
is
the
leasehold,
and
this
is
compensation
for
the
leasehold.
so
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
well
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
what
happens
to
my
client?
well,
i
suppose
that
if
it
were
dismissed,
the
county
would
start
over
in
trying
to
collect
these
taxes
but
they
would
have
to
do
it
on
a
basis
that
would
be
the
same
as
they
would
collect
other
tax
--
taxes
on
other
leaseholds
in
the
state.
they
would
--
other
words
--
in
other
words,
they
would
have
to
follow
the
statute
and
assess
and
--
and
determine
this
on
the
basis
of
what
the
lease
could
be
sold
for.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
oh,
no.
this
case
was
decided
against
us,
then
we
pay
the
taxes.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
we
--
we
would
pay
the
taxes
for
1955,
1956
and
1957.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
that
runs
to
about
$90,000
roughly,
yes.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
had
they
assessed
us
on
that
basis
it,
probably,
would
--
would
not
run
over
about
$10,000
because
our
--
our
property,
our
actual
value,
our
actual
equity
is
--
is
pretty
small
in
here.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
of
a
leasehold.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
that's
--
that's
correct.
of
a
leasehold.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
everyone
else
besides
wherry
households
--
wherry
leaseholders
in
assessing
a
lease.
they
assess
the
lease
with
its
burdens
and
benefits,
that
is
what
a
reasonable
buyer
would
pay
to
a
reasonable
seller
considering
the
mortgage.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
that's
right.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
value?
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
about
$6
million.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
about
$6
million.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
it's
about
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
assessed
valuation
that
they've
actually
put
on
here
is
about,
you
see,
they
assessed
a
50%
evaluation,
so
that
would
make
about
$2
million
of
what
they
have
actually
put
on
here.
i
want
to
save
about
five
minutes
of
my
time.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
if
the
court
please.
in
state
of
washington,
there
were
taxes
invalid,
it
maybe
enjoined
and
attacked
directly
by
statute.
now,
insofar
as
counsel's
argument
that
there
was
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
to
be
invalid,
i
don't
know,
to
be
invalid
only
because
it
is
discriminatory.
that's
the
basis
of
the
invalidity
and
the
decision
of
the
washington
supreme
court
in
the
moses
lake
homes
case
did
not
involve
any
taxes.
that
was
an
injunction
case.
it
was
a
preliminary
matter.
and
we
never
got
down
to
any
figures.
there
were
never
any
ascertain
taxes.
this
case
is
the
first
time
that
anybody
has
actually
attempted
to
collect
any
taxes,
so
that
the
decision
of
the
state
court
did
nothing
but
to
declare
what
the
state
voids.
and
the
state
law
as
it
declared
it
was
that
for
wherry
housing
projects
in
washington,
the
--
the
--
they
will
be
taxed
at
the
base
--
at
the
value
of
the
improvements
and
for
all
other
--
all
other
property.
now,
i'd
like
to
get
one
matter
straight.
well,
some
of
your
honors
were
--
were
asking
about
the
case
of
a
person
buying
property
and
whether
his
equity
would
take
into
consideration
the
mortgage.
we
are
not
in
that
situation
here.
we're
talking
about
a
leasehold.
and
in
washington,
the
cases
are
uniform
and
the
statute
has
been
construed
and
the
statute
has
not
been
changed
that
a
leasehold
must
be
valued
(inaudible)
with
its
burdens
and
benefits
and
that
is
the
universal
way.
there
are
just
no
--
there
are
just
no
exceptions
to
it,
and
that's
why
this
--
in
the
both
courts
below
found
that
there
was
a
discrimination
in
this
case.
now
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
oh,
no.
the
petitions
are
--
they're
--
they're
fully
solved,
and
there
were
not
many
--
many
matter
of
that
kind.
the
--
the
property
is
simply
being
condemned
under
a
general
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
--
program
that
the
--
that
the
government
carries
on
for
condemnation
of
the
--
of
condemning
this
--
this
wherry
act
leaseholds.
so
our
--
our
story
is
simply
that
we
have
not
been
treated
as
anybody
else
in
the
state
is
treated,
and
we
have
not
been
treated
as
anybody
leasing
similar
properties
from
the
state
would
be
treated,
and
there
are
just
no
exceptions
to
that
situation,
and
they
pick
out
these
--
these
people
but
a
blind
following
of
the
--
of
the
offutt
housing
case,
which
didn't
take
into
consideration
at
all
the
fact
of
discrimination.
now,
counsel
says
that
they
wouldn't
get
anything
if
this
went
back.
actually,
what
we're
concerned
with
is
taxes
on
moses
lake
for
three
years
which
has
been
allowed
in
the
sum
of
about
$90,000,
and
the
court
has
allowed
those
discriminatory
taxes,
although
finding
they
were
discriminatory,
on
the
basis
that
section
511,
which
is
in
one
of
the
appendixes
of
my
brief,
did
not
become
effective
until
june
16th,
1956.
and
the
--
and
that
--
that
statute
said
that
they
could
not
--
that
the
state
could
not
discriminate.
it
said
it
had
to
tax
on
the
same
basis
as
all
other
taxes.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
circuit
court
was
wrong
because
that
was
only
declaratory
of
constitutional
law
as
it
already
existed.
and
it
didn't
take
any
statute
to
say
that
the
state
couldn't
discriminate
against
the
--
against
the
government's
contractors.
but
even
without
the
statute
ever
since
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
it
has
been
ruled
that
a
state
must
tax
those
who
deal
with
the
federal
government
on
the
same
basis
of
the
tax
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
the
county
filed
a
claim
against
the
estimated
compensation
which
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
in
the
federal
court,
that's
correct.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
yes,
and
that
matter
was
passed
upon
and
then
under
the
rule
54
(b),
that
matter
was
especially
appealed.
the
condemnation
has
not
actually
--
the
--
the
main
condemnation
has
not
actually
been
determined
yet.
this
is
a
--
a
side
issue
in
the
condemnation
case.
and
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
it
rates
--
it
relates
to
method
--
to
method
of
taxation.
it
isn't
a
matter
that
we
can
take
up
before
the
equalization
board
because
the
--
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
they
would
look
at
it
and
use
their
judgment
but
it
has
to
do
with
the
law
of
washington
as
interpreted
by
its
highest
court
which
is
said
that
in
determining
this
kind
of
a
--
of
a
tax
that
they
shall
appraise
it
on
the
basis
of
the
--
of
the
buildings.
and
they
left
no
room
for
the
burdens
and
benefits
theory,
and
they
left
no
room
for
the
application
of
the
statutory
test
as
to
what
a
buyer
would
pay
to
a
willing
seller
of
the
leasehold,
and
there
has
never
been
any
determination
in
any
washington
case
to
the
effect
that
a
long
term
lease
converts
the
property
into
ownership
in
the
government.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
no,
your
honor.
that
was
this
matter
where
the
court
or
in
the
state
court,
they
held
that
under
the
law
of
washington,
the
method
of
determining
--
the
method
of
taxing
is
to
tax
the
leasehold,
and
they
used
the
word
“leasehold”
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
buildings.
that's
--
that's
the
very
decision
that
brought
about
the
discrimination.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
i
have
our
brief
below.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
i
don't.
i
didn't
bring
it
definitely
with
me,
your
honor.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
well,
what
--
what
they
--
what
they
did
for
the
first
time
here
was
to
advance
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
discrimination.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
that
was
admitted
below,
and
it's
even
in
their
--
in
their
request
for
admission.
they
admitted
that
they
didn't
take
into
consideration
the
burdens
and
benefits.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
i'll
have
to
wait
until
i
get
back
home
and
--
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
--
mail
them.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lyle
l.
iverson
i'll
be
glad
to.
