mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
brought
this
case
to
this
court
because
--
although
they
never
reached
majority,
the
federal
court
of
new
york
held
that
they
were
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
this
action
is
a
wrongful
death
action.
it's
brought
for
the
wrongful
death
of
lucia
who
was
killed
in
a
crash
of
an
aircraft
in
california.
the
defendant,
transocean,
owned
and
operated
the
aircraft.
jurisdiction
is
based
upon
diversity
of
citizenship.
the
action
was
brought
in
the
u.s.
district
court,
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
defendant
moved
to
dismiss
from
the
ground
that
the
action
that
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
district
court
granted
judgment
dismissing
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
defendant's
contentions
on
the
statute
of
limitations
are
roughly
as
--
briefly
as
--
as
follows,
"section
13
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act,
provides
in
effect
of
that
a
nonresident
who
brings
a
cause
of
--
brings
an
action
based
on
a
cause
of
action
that
arises
outside
of
new
york,
is
barred
if
they
would
be
barred
in
the
state
where
the
cause
of
action
arose."
section
13
expressly
accepts
from
that
provision
residents
of
new
york.
the
courts
of
new
york
have
consistently
held
that
in
effect,
the
purpose
of
section
13
was
to
prevent
nonresidents
coming
into
new
york,
suing
in
new
york,
if
at
the
time
they
sued
in
new
york,
they
could
not
have
brought
the
action
in
the
state
or
the
cause
of
action
arose.
in
other
words,
new
york
courts
do
not
merely
adopt
the
time
limit
of
the
state
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
it's
a
mere
yardstick
that
they
apply
all
of
the
law
of
the
other
state
to
determine
in
--
in
effect
could
this
plaintiff
have
brought
her
action
in
the
state
where
the
cause
of
action
arose,
if
they
couldn't,
they
cannot
come
in
here.
applying
this
reasoning,
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
looked
to
california,
the
state
where
the
cause
of
action
arose,
here.
they
first
referred
to
section
340
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure
which
provides
that
an
action
for
wrongful
death
must
be
brought
within
one
year.
the
court
then
looked
to
the
tolling
provision
in
california
which
is
section
352
of
the
california
code
of
civil
procedure,
which
provides
that
the
statute
of
limitations
shall
be
tolled
during
minority
or
during
the
time
of
disability.
reasoning
of
that
--
or
the
defendant
then
urged
rather
that
section
25
of
the
civil
code
of
california,
applied
in
this
case.
they
argued
vastly
that
section
25,
which
i
would
describe
as
a
--a
capacity
statute
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
--
of
the
death
or
the
--
the
time
of
cause
of
action
arose
here,
provided
that
a
female
who
was
married
at
age
18
should
be
deemed
an
adult
and
should
be
deemed
an
adult
person
for
the
purpose
of
engaging
in
transactions
respecting
property.
now,
the
respondent
cited
two
cases
to
the
court
below.
two
california
cases
that
are
cited
in
both
of
our
briefs,
the
haro
case
and
the
caraway
case,
which
construed
section
25
to
mean
that
--
that
this
phrase
engaged
in
transactions
respecting
property,
gave
a
married
female,
age
18,
a
capacity
to
sue.
and
therefore,
at
18,
the
disability
of
infancy
seized
and
therefore,
the
statute
of
limitation
should
commence
to
run.
and
in
both
cases,
the
haro
case
and
the
caraway
case,
which
involved
residents
of
california,
the
court
did
dismiss
because
the
--
in
both
cases,
the
--
the
female
had
brought
the
action
after
she
reached
the
age
19.
we
argued
--
we
argued
here,
your
honor,
that
there
was
two
cases
in
california
which
indicated
that
california
would
not
apply
these
cases
to
a
nonresident,
a
noncitizen
of
california.
the
cases
are
cited
deason
against
jones
and
emery
against
emery.
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
california
court,
in
the
emery
case,
the
california
supreme
court
applied
the
rule
of
the
domicile
to
determine
whether
or
not,
plaintiffs
had
a
capacity
to
sue.
correction,
in
the
emery
case,
that
was
the
specific
(inaudible)
the
deason
case,
the
problem
was
a
little
different,
but
was
related.
in
the
deason
case,
the
defendant,
an
infant,
while
living
i
believe
in
--
it
was
in
wyoming,
obtained
a
court
order
empowering
him
to
transact
a
business
and
to
make
contracts
concerning
that
business.
he
at
the
time
was
--
was
18.
thereafter,
he
moved
to
california
and
prior
to
reaching
age
21,
entered
into
a
contract
in
california,
a
real
estate
contract,
a
dispute
rose
over
the
contract
and
the
other
party
of
the
contract
brought
a
suit
against
the
infant.
and
the
infant
raised
as
a
defense
his
infancy
that
he
was
under
age
21
when
he
entered
into
the
contract.
the
plaintiff's
reply
to
that
case,
"yes,
but
you
were
emancipated
and
you,
in
effect,
are
deemed
an
adult
when
you
reached
18
under
the
order
of
the
court
of
the
neighboring
state."
however,
the
california
court
refused
to
accept
plaintiff's
argument
and
held
that
matters
of
capacity
to
sue
concerning
infants
was
primarily
a
concern
of
the
state
wherein
the
infant
resided.
later,
the
california
supreme
court
had
before
it,
the
emery
against
emery
case.
in
that
case,
plaintiffs
were
a
wife
and
two
daughters
for
bringing
action
against
the
husband's
father
and
a
son
for
personal
injuries
sustained
in
an
automobile
accident
in
a
neighboring
state
of
california,
as
i
recall,
i
believe
it
was
arizona.
but
in
any
event,
the
problem
--
the
conflict
arose
in
the
neighboring
state
where
the
accident
occurred
and
the
injuries
were
sustained
forbade
suits
among
members
of
a
family,
between
spouses
and
offspring.
however
in
california,
the
rule
was
that
such
suits
were
permitted
for
gross
negligence.
the
matter
came
up
before
the
supreme
court
on
motion.
the
defendant's
motion
had
been
granted
in
the
court
below.
the
supreme
court
reversed
fully
that
there
again,
that
the
question
of
capacity
to
sue
was
a
primary
concern
to
the
state
of
domicile.
and
that
california
should
apply
the
rule
of
the
domiciliary
state
which
in
the
emery
case
was
the
california
--
was
california
and
they
permitted
the
suit.
of
course,
there
were
--
they
send
it
back
for
trial
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
gross
negligence.
we
urge
these
cases
and
we
urge
them
now,
as
clearly
showing
that
california,
if
we
had
literally
sued,
brought
this
action
in
california,
california
courts
would
have
permitted
this
suit,
since
california
would
have
applied
the
rule
of
the
domicile,
which
in
this
case
is
south
carolina.
south
carolina,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute
about
it,
minority
continues
into
age
21
--
until
age
21.
and
we
--
we
urge
that
the
courts
of
california
would
have
reasoned
that
their
statute
of
limitations
then
begin
to
run
until
this
widow
and
her
infant
child
had
reached
age
21.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
we
quoted
and
cited
in
our
brief.
we
say
--
we
say
to
that
and
that
was
raised
in
the
court
below.
we
say
this,
"that
here,
california
has
--
you
might
say
granted
adulthood
to
a
female
woman
at
age
18
because
she
has
married."
and
we
say
that
that
too
is
a
very
important
family
relationship.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
your
honor
and
i
would
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
would
say
that
--
that
a
couple
with
the
deason
case.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
well,
we
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
your
honor
that
presents
--
again,
i
know
--
the
problem
that's
always
being
faced
by
the
federal
courts.
and
on
this
case,
you
have
a
federal
court
seating
in
new
york,
asked
to
apply
not
only
the
new
york
law
but
referring
to
the
new
york
law,
then
being
asked
to
apply
the
california
law.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
don't
say
that
this
was
a
simple
problem
or
that
the
--
the
court
below
was
foolish
or
--
or
silly
or
incompetent.
we
--
we
strongly
disagree
with
their
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
they
--
they
have
a
choice
after,
your
honor.
it
can
be
brought
by
the
heirs.
here,
the
--
the
widow
and
child
or
it
could
have
been
brought
by
the
legal
representative.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
commence
the
action.
we
--
we
also
brought
in
the
administrator.
and
in
fact,
we
were
in
some
doubt
at
that
time
as
to
just
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
but
the
--
the
california
courts
have
construed
this
to
--
to
in
effect,
to
cover
widows
and
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
no,
they
don't
entirely
hold
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
we
--
there
is
a
question
on
that
that
i
will
get
to.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
in
addition
to
the
emery
case
and
the
deason
case,
we
also
urge
that
rule
17
(b)
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
had
a
bearing
on
this
case,
this
question.
17
(b),
the
part
that
we
--
that
is
relevant
here,
provides
that
the
capacity
of
an
individual
to
sue
or
be
sued
shall
be
determined
by
the
law
of
his
domicile.
now,
we
argue,
your
honor
that
basically,
california
considered
the
statute
of
limitations
to
become
operative
when
the
plaintiff
in
--
obtain
or
attain
a
capacity
to
sue.
that
was
the
reasoning
in
the
caraway
case
and
in
the
haro
case.
we
feel
that
the
court
should
have
considered
this
rule
also
as
a
--
as
a
guide.
we
feel
that
--
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
--
to
claim
that
there
was
a
direct
conflict.
in
fact,
we
--
our
argument
is
that
the
california
rule
as
to
the
applying
the
law
of
the
domicile
and
the
rule
17
(b),
are
consistent.
and
in
fact
that
the
--
the
court
below
should
have
avoided
a
conflict
between
the
--
the
local
state
law
and
the
federal
rule,
if
there
was
a
doubt
about
it.
and
we
say
that
at
least,
there
was
a
doubt
about
what
the
law
of
california
was
on
this
question.
and
as
i
say,
we
--
we
urge
that
the
deason
case
and
emery
case
clearly
indicate
that
california
would've
applied
the
law
of
south
carolina
to
determine
when
the
petitioners
attained
capacity
to
sue.
the
question
that
was
asked
as
to
the
joint
--
joint
nature
of
the
action
has
also
brought
an
issue
here.
the
respondent
presented
to
the
court
below
two
cases
that
are
cited
in
both
briefs,
sears
against
majors
and
haro
against
southern
pacific,
both
california
cases.
involving
california
infants
in
those
cases,
the
will
brought
action
for
wrongful
death
after
obtaining
the
age
of
19.
and
if
--
as
in
the
--
our
situation,
there
was
also
a
--
an
infant
child
surviving
and
in
both
cases,
the
--
the
intermediate
courts
of
california
held
that
the
action
was
a
joint
action.
and
therefore
if
one
is
barred,
all
are
barred
as
was
pointed
out
and
therefore,
the
infant
child
was
also
barred.
now,
the
court
below
on
our
case
followed
these
two
cases.
now,
we
argued
that
other
cases
in
california
including
a
--
a
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
applied
in
more
recent
times
what
appeared
to
us
and
what
we
urged
strongly,
was
a
different
rule.
the
question
that
brought
this
--
the
--
the
nature
of
the
--
the
jointness
of
this
action
before
the
court
involved
the
question
of
contributory
negligence
in
the
cases
that
we
cite,
bowler,
bowen,
flores
and
perkins,
the
most
recent
case
being
perkins
against
robertson,
robertson
out
in
california
in
1956.
and
in
those
cases,
it
so
happened
that
one
of
the
heirs
was
barred
by
--
by
reason
of
contributory
negligence.
and
the
defendant
raised
the
same
issue
that
well,
since
the
action
is
joint,
if
one
is
barred,
all
are
barred.
and
the
courts
in
those
cases,
without
reference
to
--
to
sears
or
haro
or
the
older
cases,
the
reason
that
the
action
was
joint
only
in
the
sense
that
all
should
join
in
the
action,
all
heirs,
the
--
it
was
a
single
action,
only
in
that
a
single
action
should
be
right
and
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
harassed
by
a
series
of
actions
by
each
heir.
only
in
that
sense
was
the
--
was
the
action,
a
joint
action.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
would
say
no,
your
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
don't
--
i
don't
pretend
to
--
to
know
the
answer
to
that
one,
as
under
california
law,
your
honor,
in
my
search
of
this
question
under
the
--
in
the
california
cases.
i
did
not
run
into
that
precise
question.
i
would
--
i
would
reason
that
if
--
if
the
respondent's
case
is
haro
and
sears
would
apply
that
the
action
would
regard
as
against
the
infant
too.
on
the
--
on
the
--
again,
that
the
simple
logic
which
apparently
the
court
used
in
--
in
the
older
cases
that
if
one
is
barred,
all
are
barred.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
would
say,
your
honor
that
under
the
--
under
the
reasoning
of
the
cases
that
we
urge
is
controlling,
the
infant
would
not
be
barred.
that
only
--
that
only
the
mother
would
be
barred.
since
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
joint
requirement
is
--
is
to
prevent
a
multiplicity
of
suits,
a
harassment
of
the
defendant.
we
also
urged
in
the
court
below
that
in
effect,
the
dismissal
of
these
actions
has
resulted
in
an
abridgement
of
the
petitioner's
right
--
the
privileges
and
immunities
right
under
the
federal
constitution
article
4,
section
2.
the
--
this
court
had
occasion
to
consider
a
case
of
a
borrowing
statute
very
similar
to
north
--
to
new
york's
in
1920,
the
canadian
northern
against
eggen.
it
did
not
involve
an
infant,
at
least
as
far
as
appears
from
the
record
in
that
case
and
certainly
no
issue
was
made
of
it.
it
so
happened
in
that
case
that
under
the
borrowing
statute,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
still
had
a
year
to
come
into
the
forum
court.
and
this
court
held
in
--
in
effect
that
--
that
article
4
merely
requires
the
state
to
--
to
offer
reasonable
access
as
far
as
access
to
courts
are
concerned.
and
they
--
there
--
that
this
court
there
held
that
one
year
to
come
into
the
court,
was
reasonable
access.
our
contention
here
is
that
these
--
the
petitioners,
the
widow
and
the
child,
did
not
have
that
reasonable
access.
the
courts
below
held
that
our
petitioner,
the
widow,
was
barred
which
she
reached
the
age
19
and
as
i
say,
by
reasoning
that
the
child
was
also
barred
because
it
was
a
joint
action
that
i
think
the
infant
child
was
under
seven,
six,
five,
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
at
that
time.
and
we
contend
that,
that
was
not
reasonable
access,
that
access
to
a
court
should
be
under
conditions
offering
the
party
reasonable
opportunity
to
--
to
present
his
case
and
--
and
protect
itself,
that
the
basic
purpose
of
--
well
of
tolling
statutes
of
--
and
of
the
special
protection
that
the
courts
do
offer
infants,
they
are
all
based
on
the
basic
idea
that
--
that
infants
are
not
capable
of
protecting
themselves
and
looking
out
after
their
injuries.
the
respondent
has
--
has
answered
that
by
saying
that,
well,
in
new
york,
these
petitioners
could
have
come
in
at
that
time
through
a
guardian
ad
litem.
we
say
that
that's
still
does
not
answer
the
problem
there.
that
--
how
-
how
do
we
know
that
the
infants
know
enough
to
go
about
getting
a
guardian
ad
litem?
and
in
new
york,
the
mere
fact
that
an
infant
can
come
in
through
a
guardian
ad
litem,
does
not
change
the
tolling
provisions
in
new
york.
the
infant
can
still
--
the
infant
still
--
infancy
still
tolls
the
statute
in
new
york,
even
though
during
that
period,
the
infant
could
come
in
through
a
guardian
ad
litem.
in
essence
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
is
true
your
honor,
but
how
--
how
does
that
infant,
first
at
least,
bring
this
matter
to
the
attention
of
adults,
if
they
may
or
they
may
not,
your
honor?
we
feel
that
there's
a
great
--
a
great
danger
here
in
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
beg
your
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
said,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
would
not
dispute
that
claim
with.
i
would
say
that
presumably,
a
guardian
ad
litem
would
take
proper
care
of
an
infant,
but
i
say
that
the
problem
goes
back
beyond
that.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
they
not
get
to
the
guardian
in
the
first
place.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
on
behalf
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
is
true
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
your
honor,
i
think
where
we
disagree
is
i
would
say
that
the
--
the
guardian
ad
litem
may
not
be
there.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
the
--
the
period
is
--
is
tolled
even
though
that
guardian
ad
litem
is
there.
in
effect,
it
gives
the
--
the
infant
in
new
york
a
choice.
he
can't
--
or
a
guardian
ad
litem
can't
sue
on
behalf
of
the
infant
during
that
infancy
period,
but
he
can
also
wait
until
reaching
majority
and
then
assert
period
(inaudible).
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
he's
protected
ordinarily,
but
i
--
i
say
that
in
conclusion
that
the
--
that
the
lower
courts
have
not
looked
closely
at
the
california
law.
that
they
have
adopted
a
--
this
complex
rule
which
they
felt
was
the
better
rule.
and
the
fact,
i
think,
the
circuit
court
characterized
the
--
the
forum
rule
that
they
did
adopt
here
as
the
better
rule.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
believe
all
the
cases
we
cited
were
before
the
court.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
it
did,
your
honor.
it
did
in
most
--
very
definitely
did.
we
--
we
do
say
that
under
the
erie
doctrine
that
the
cases,
for
instance,
of
deason
and
emery
represented
strong
clear
dicta
or
data
indicating
what
the
california
courts
would
do,
the
circuit
court
disagreed
with
us.
they
--
in
effects
of
the
--
they
have
no
relevant
--
relevance
here.
on
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
--
question
of
--
of
the
infant
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
we're
reviewing
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
would
say
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
know
they
are
your
honor
and
i
would
say,
the
latter.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
--
that
is
true
your
honor
that
--
or
put
it
--
as
i
--
as
i
would
put
it
that
this
court
is
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
court
below,
sitting
in
new
york,
applying
new
york
law,
which
by
reference
that
through
as
borrowing
statute,
incorporates
the
law
of
california.
i
would
say
this,
that
if
these
were
before
a
state
court
in
new
york
that
the
state
court
would
be
in
--
in
exactly
the
same
position
that
a
federal
court
is,
in
trying
to
find
what
new
york
state
law
is
that
--
that
the
new
york
state
court
would
look
to
california
and
look
to
all
the
cases
and
try
not
to
--
in
effect,
predict
if
there
isn't
a
case
employed.
predict
what
the
highest
court
of
california
would
do
with
this
situation
here.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
sir.
that's
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
think
that
we
--
we
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
--
all
three,
basically
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
under
theory,
was
up
to
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
once
removed,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
wouldn't
say
that
--
that
the
district
court
in
new
york
--
the
problem
there
before
it
was,
what
would
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
find
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
would
find
if
this
question
were
before
the
supreme
court
of
california?
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
well,
that's
very
true,
your
honor.
and
i
--
and
i
say
on
that
your
honor
that
they
--
their
position,
their
--
their
treatment
of
foreign
law
is
--
at
least
there
is
no
difference,
i
don't
believe
in
this
case,
between
what
the
district
court,
federal
district
court
would
do
in
looking
to
the
foreign
law
and
then
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
would
do
in
looking
to
foreign
law.
it
too,
would
look
to
all
relevant
cases,
all
relevant
type.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
alright.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
no
sir
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
--
we
do
not.
i'd
like
to
refer
again
to
--
to
17
(b),
the
rule
17
(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
procedure.
i
don't
believe
i
--
i
have
made
my
point
clear
or
our
point
clear,
as
to
how
that
applies
to
our
question
here.
our
reasoning
is
this,
there
is
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
rule
17
(b)
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
--
that
provides,
in
substance,
the
capacity
of
an
individual
to
sue
shall
be
determined
by
the
law
of
his
domicile.
that
rule
appears
to
me
to
be
relevant.
and
the
question
again
as
to
when
statute
of
limitations
run
on
this
case
--
when
it
started
to
run,
because
referring
again
out
to
california,
california
--
there
is
no
--
the
--
the
statute
in
california
does
not
expressly
say
that
the
--
that
the
tolling
provisions
shall
seize
at
age
18.
that
has
been
concluded
by
the
california
courts
from
the
wording
of
the
statute.
now,
their
--
their
reasoning
on
that
is
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
it
does,
your
honor.
it
does
have
that
effect,
but
i
--
i
urge
that
the
reasoning
there
is
based
on
--
primarily
on
capacity
to
sue.
that
to
get
down
to
the
heart
of
this
matter
of
why
--
why
should
they
look
to
south
carolina
and
why
should
the
law
of
the
domicile,
they
all,
rather
than
the
law
of
the
forum,
gets
down
to
this
question
of
capacity
to
sue.
that
--
that
is
something
that
the
state
of
domicile
should
control.
and
i
believe
in
the
deason
case
and
in
--
and
in
the
--
the
emery
case
that
that
was
exactly
what
the
court
really
was
driving
at.
the
capacity
to
sue
should
be
a
matter
controlled
by
the
--
by
the
--
the
domicile
state.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
your
honor,
but
that
also
--
but
that
depends
on
when
the
capacity
to
sue
took
effect
here.
we
say
that
she
had
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
six
--
section
25
of
this
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that's
--
i
--
i
would
characterize
that
statute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
by
judicial
construction
that
it
has
been
applied
to
the
statute
of
limitations
situation,
the
--
the
court
referred
from
the
statute,
from
the
wording
of
the
statute
--
from
the
--
the
capacity
to
engage
in
transactions
respecting
property,
they
concluded
from
there
that
that
statute
included
within
the
powers
to
transact
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
--
engage
in
process.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
true.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that's
--
that's
true.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
the
question
there
is,
would
--
would
california
have
referred
to
its
own
forum
law
to
determine
when
the
infants
in
this
case
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
--
that
is
true,
your
honor.
that
--
you
get
up
to
california
and
that
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
conclude
my
argument
with
a
brief
summary
of
the
facts
which
i
feel
presents
a
very
harsh
result,
a
result
that
has
left
a
three
months
old
child
without
her
day
in
court.
i'd
like
to
summarize
briefly
the
salient
facts
as
we
see
them.
the
father
of
this
child
died
march
20,
1953.
at
that
time,
this
child
was
three
months
of
age.
the
wife
was
slightly
over
16
years
of
age.
the
court
below
in
dismissing
this
cause
of
action,
both
--
i
feel
both
causes
of
action
when
the
wife
reached
--
reached
the
age
19.
at
that
time,
this
child
was
three
years
of
age.
in
fact
at
the
present
time,
the
child
is
just
little
over
eight
years
of
age.
now,
california
gave
that
child
a
cause
of
action
with
the
death
of
the
father.
that
cause
of
action
did
not
belong
to
the
mother,
it
belonged
to
the
child.
true,
california
considered
it
a
joint
cause
of
action
but
only
in
the
sense
that
one
cause
of
action
should
be
brought
by
all
heirs.
but
that
child
nevertheless
had
a
cause
of
action
which
has
been
barred.
and
it
has
been
barred,
i
say,
because
that
child
was
a
citizen
of
south
carolina.
i
say
that
the
result
in
this
case
is
a
clear
violation
of
article
4
section
2
of
the
constitution.
if
this
child
had
been
a
resident
of
new
york,
there
can
be
no
question
that
she's
still
be
in
court
today,
and
she
would've
been
heard.
but
because
she
was
a
resident
of
south
carolina,
she
is
out
of
court.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
sir,
under
--
under
the
laws
of
new
york,
if
she
had
been
a
resident
of
new
york,
and
had
sued
on
the
california
wrongful
death
statute,
she
would
have
had
until
at
least
age
21
to
bring
the
action
and
beyond.
and
in
fact,
new
york
has
a
statute
for
its
own
wrongful
death
statute
as
of
two-year
statute
of
limitations
but
that
only
applies
to
the
new
york
wrongful
death
statute.
a
cause
of
action
on
a
wrongful
death
statute
in
another
state
--
well,
i
cite
a
case
in
one
of
my
footnotes,
james
against
sackman
in
which
the
federal
court
in
new
york
reasoned
that
--
that
new
york
would
probably
apply
at
least
their
six-year
statute
of
limitations
for
causes
of
action
based
on
a
statute.
they
--
they
looked
at
the
new
york
law.
they
saw
that
the
limitation
period
of
two
years
on
the
new
york
wrongful
death
statute
only
applied
to
the
new
york
statute,
and
that,
they
looked
elsewhere
in
the
statute
of
limitations
for
applicable
law
and
they
held
that
it
would
be
as
--
at
least
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
in
new
york.
there
has
been
no
serious
dispute
in
the
courts
below
as
--
as
to
that
factors,
that
facet
of
a
case.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
if
the
child
was
a
citizen
of
california,
our
argument
is
based
on
this
reasoning
that
the
court
should've
applied
the
rule
of
the
domicile.
if
you
mean
the
child
had
been
a
resident
of
california,
i
would
say
that
no
doubt,
the
california
court
would
apply
its
own
--
own
law,
section
25.
as
to
the
spouse,
we
still
quarrel
with
the
lower
court's
determination
that
the
infant
would
be
barred
even
in
california.
we
say
even
--
even
as
to
one
of
its
own
residents
in
california,
that
under
the
more
recent
cases,
including
two
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
that
the
courts
would
no
longer
consider
the
infant
barred
when
the
mother
was
barred,
certainly,
if
--
if
a
mother
--
resident's
--
if
the
mother
in
this
case
had
been
contributory
negligent
and
have
been
barred.
now,
clearly
under
the
california
statute
--
decisions,
including
two
in
the
supreme
court
of
california,
that
still
would
not
have
barred
the
child.and
we
say
that
by
the
same
reason,
the
bar
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
assuming
that
it
applied
to
the
mother,
certainly,
should
not
have
been
applied
to
the
infant.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
the
emery
and
deason
cases
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
port
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
beg
your
pardon.
your
honor,
i
was
not
referring
to
the
emery
and
deason
cases
on
that
point.
i
should
have
referred
to
bowler
against
roos
and
flores
against
brown.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
those
are
in
our
brief.
and
those
concern
the
contributory
negligence
rule
in
california,
and
they
are
the
cases
we
say
more
recent
cases
that
indicate
--
even
in
california,
even
a
local
matter
including,
you
know
--
that
would
involved
merely
a
local
accident,
a
local
residence
and
so
forth
that
they
would
not
follow
those
old
cases
that
were
applied
in
this
case.
and
we
say
that
--
i'd
like
to
stress
again
that
i
will
feel
strongly
that
--
that
the
cases
and
the
statute
--
statutes,
and
rule
17
(b)
have
been
construed
in
such
a
way
as
to
clearly
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
say,
your
honor
article
4
section
2,
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
of
--
of
the
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
--
mother
and
her
child.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
that
--
the
constitutional
provision
on
--
on
the
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i'd
say
of
the
wife
and
child,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
citizen,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
would
say
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
acknowledge
the
distinction
that
has
been
made
in
the
cases,
your
honor.
i
say
to
that,
that
that
distinction
as
a
practical
matter,
as
between
resident
and
--
residents
and
citizenship
applied
in
--
to
this
statute
from
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
that
it's
a
practical
matter.
i
--
i
can't
see
new
york,
in
other
words,
applying
this
rule
to
a
citizen
of
its
state
who
happens
to
be
a
non-resident
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
we
would
have,
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i
believe
it
should
be
applied
in
--
in
many
cases.
it
hasn't
been.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
well,
i
say
your
honor
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
case
would
be
applied
999
times
out
of
a
thousand
to
a
non-citizen
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
i
propose
your
honor
respectfully
that
--
that
we
should
look
beyond
the
use
of
its
terminology.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
that's
true.
it
may
be
that.
but
i
say
--
i
would
go
back
to
my
original
proposition
your
honor
that
in
this
--
as
applied
to
this
statute
that
--
well
as
far
as
i'd
looked
to
see
if
new
york
had
ever
applied
the
statute
in
this
--
in
the
circumstances
of
a
citizen
of
a
state
will
have
to
be
(inaudible)
at
the
time
and
i
found
none.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
well,
i
say
to
that
your
honor
that
--
that
certainly,
i
have
to
be
guided
by
the
recorded
opinions.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
your
honor,
i
believe
there
has
been
some
--
have
been
some
cases
in
this
court.
they
have
ignored
that
distinction.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
submit
--
submit
a
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
would
say
i'm
asking
this
court
to
look
behind
the
wording
--
to
--
to
the
actuality
to
the
situation.
and
i
believe
it's
important
not
only
in
this
case
but
many,
many
states
have
a
borrowing
type
of
statute.
and
i
believe
that
when
an
infant
gets
caught
in
some
very
harsh
--
very,
very
hard
legalistic
reasoning
based
on
this
borrowing
statute.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
court
should
look
very
closely
into
this
--
this
situation
and
as
it
had
been
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
your
honor,
i
--
i
believe
there's
been
some
confusion
in
the
flores
case.
the
flores
case
merely
borrowed
--
barred
the
spouse.
it
did
not
--
or
--
or
the
caraway
case,
merely
--
well,
the
question
of
barring
--
barring
a
spouse,
it
did
not
involve
an
infant
child.
i
believe
that
the
side
of
this
--
and
it
rather
confused
matter
here
that
may
confuse
the
problem.
on
the
question
of
the
barring
of
the
child,
only
the
sears,
haro
and
gates
cases
relate
to
that
question.
so
that
the
caraway
case
involved,
we
say,
a
domicile
of
california.
we
don't
question
the
fact
that
in
california,
the
law
is
fairly
well
settled
that
a
domicile
--
quite
domiciled
in
that
state
would
be
barred
at
a
--
ajp.
but
it
didn't
pertain
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
non
--
of
course
not
domiciled
in
california
would
have
section
25
applied
to
her
or
not.
and
that's
where
we
say
the
emery
--
emery
case
is
burden,
emery
and
deason
cases.i
believe
the
question
has
been
raised
as
to
the
administrator
and
we
did
not
raise
that
in
the
district
court,
we
did
not
raise
it
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
reason
we
did
--
as
you
note,
we
did
commence
the
action,
originally
with
an
administrator.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
we
were
in
doubt
about
that.
the
new
york
statute
section
13
uses
the
phrase,
"originally
approved
to
a
resident".
we
construe
that
to
mean
that
under
california
law,
this
cause
of
action
originally
accrued
to
the
wife
and
her
child,
widow
and
her
child.
and
that
under
the
new
york
law,
the
expressions
originally
accruing
would've
applied
strictly
as
of
the
time
the
accident
accrued
to
the
--
the
widow
and
child,
so
that
the
appointment
of
an
administrator
would
not
have
made
any
difference.
but
i
must
be
frank
to
say
that
--
that
we
looked
into
the
case
to
some
extent.
i
don't
recall
offhand.
i
don't
have
them
with
me.
recalling
from
memory,
there
were
some
lower
court
decisions
indicating
that
they
would
look
back
the
appointment
of
administrator
in
this
type
of
a
situation.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
i
--
if
i
have
them
your
honor
i
will.
is
there
any
way
i
could
arrange
to
--
to
get
them
to
the
court,
if
i
don't
them
today?
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
thank
you.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
your
honor
it's
--
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
dwyer
we'll
see.
