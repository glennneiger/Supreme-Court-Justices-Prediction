oh
while

was
brought
(inaudible).
justice

black
i
understand
it
was
a
capacity
to
sue
based
on
one
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
capacity
to
sue
here
is
based
on
another
point,
another
ground
--
justice

black
--
(voice

i
believe
the
capacity
to
sue,
isn't
it?
justice

black
that's
right.

with
the
different
situation.
justice

black
they
applied
the
law
of
the
domicile
in
both
of
those
cases,
did
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
basis
that
the
law
of
the
domicile
determined
in
those
two
cases,
in
reference
to
those
two
things
the
capacity
to
sue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
this
point,
may
i
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
of
that
to
get
clearly
if
i
can
the
law
you've
given?
suppose
this
lady
and
her
little
child
had
lived
in
new
york,
from
residence
from
new
york,
her
father
and
husband
has
been
in
killed
in
california
as
he
was.
and
a
suit
had
been
brought
in
new
york
under
those
circumstances.
what
would
have
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
about
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
new
york
law,
if
she
had
been
a
resident
of
new
york
at
the
time
of
the
accident,
the
time
of
the
suit
was
filed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
--
when
would
the
statute
have
right
against
her
as
a
--
she
was
a
resident
now.
she
didn't
live
in
south
carolina
but
lived
in
new
york
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
this
suit
and
she
filed
this
particular
suit
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
this
particular
death,
what
would
have
been
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
she
became
21.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
been
filed
in
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
suppose
instead
of
that,
she
had
lived
in
new
york
and
had
appointed
--
an
administrator
had
been
appointed,
(inaudible)
or
whatever
you
call
it,
in
your
state
in
south
carolina,
and
he
had
filed
decisions.
what
would
have
been
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
an
administrator
who
lives
in
south
carolina,
her
father
(inaudible).
what
would
have
been
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
this
lady
lived
in
new
york
the
time
their
suit
was
drawn.
the
laws
of
new
york
would
have
permitted
her
to
file
this
action
and
would
not
have
been
barred
with
the
statute
of
limitations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
why
i
asking
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
held
or
the
highest
court
of
new
york
held
when
a
--
a
resident
of
new
york
is
the
administrator
of
an
estate
of
a
person
like
this
and
filed
suit?
what
statute
of
limitations
applied?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
accident
is
happened
in
california.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
has
the
supreme
court
or
your
highest
court
of
your
state
held
with
reference
to
that
type
of
suit
under
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
notice
--
i
thought
it
did
come
and
that
--
that
was
raised
and
--
that
the
court
below
said
that
the
supreme
--
the
courts
of
new
york
had
never
passed
on
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
said
there
had
been
no
decisions
on
it,
did
he
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
the
case
of
clay
against
the
sun
life
assurance
company?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
in
your
way
of
telling
us
of
any
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
any
opinion
of
any
lower
court
of
the
trial
of
any
lawsuit
in
the
lowest
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
law
of
new
york
bars
under
the
statute,
under
which
you
claim
now,
bars
the
suit
filed
by
a
non-resident
administrator
or
non-resident
plaintiff?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
was
the
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
court,
of
that
point
were.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
any
new
york
cases
that
--
that
show
what
new
york
would
decide
on
this
particular
case
or
kinds
of
case,
if
it
found
the
law
of
california
in
doubt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
what
would
it
do
with
reference
to
apply
to
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
seems
to
be
quite
an
argument
here
what
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
or
not
the
courts
would
attempt
to
apply
the
policy
that
the
state
recognizes
there
from
the
residents
under
18,
under
21?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
spell
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
appreciate
that
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
--
could
you
leave
those
to
the
clerk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
california
death
statute,
is
it
cited
in
either
one
of
your
briefs?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
mean

it
quoted?

hugo
l.
