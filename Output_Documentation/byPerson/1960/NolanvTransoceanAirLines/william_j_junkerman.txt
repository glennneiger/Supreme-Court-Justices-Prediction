mr.
william
j.
junkerman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
and
respondent
are
in
basic
agreement
that
the
lower
courts
were
required
to
apply
the
new
york
law
including
its
conflict
of
law's
rule
and
its
statute
of
limitations.
under
the
new
york
conflict
of
law's
rule,
any
substantive
right
which
the
petitioners
may
have
for
the
alleged
wrongful
death
or
their
decedent,
is
governed
the
law
of
california.
under
borrowing
provisions
of
the
new
york
statute
of
limitations,
this
action
cannot
be
enforced
in
the
courts
of
new
york
if
it
is
barred
by
the
statutes
of
california.
the
basic
question
presented
to
the
lower
courts
therefore,
as
petitioners
point
out
at
page
11
of
their
brief
was
whether
petitioners
would
have
been
barred
in
california
if
their
suit
had
been
brought
there
instead
of
in
new
york.
now,
under
section
25,
the
california
civil
code,
"any
female
who
has
contracted
a
lawful
marriage
and
thereafter
reaches
the
age
of
18
years
shall
upon
reaching
the
age
of
18
years,
be
of
the
age
of
majority
and
be
deemed
an
adult
person
for
the
purpose
of
entering
into
any
transaction,
respecting
property,
the
same
as
if
she
were
21
years
of
age."
that
particular
statute
has
been
before
the
california
courts
a
number
of
times
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
there
were
four
cases
directly
in
point,
four
california
cases
directly
in
point.
they
are
district
court
of
appeal
cases.
they
are
not
of
this
supreme
court
of
california.
the
question
never
got
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
the
first
of
the
cases
that
we
referred
to
is
sears
against
major
--
majors
that's
104
cal.app.
60.
it
was
a
1930
decision
decided
in
our
brief.
it
involved
a
decedent
who
let
him
surviving
a
wife
of
full
age
and
a
son
15
years
of
age.
the
court
held
that
since
the
action
was
barred
to
the
mother,
it
was
also
barred
to
the
son.
now,
in
haro
against
southern
pacific,
17
ca
2d
594,
that
was
in
1936
case.
this
is
a
case
are
all
force.
there,
the
widow
was
19
at
the
time
of
her
husband's
death.
she
left
one
child,
who
was
one
year
old
and
another
who
was
less
than
three
months
old
at
the
time
of
his
death.
the
action
was
started
one
--
more
than
one
year
after
haro's
death
but
before
the
widow
reached
the
age
of
21.
the
court
ruled
that
the
action
was
barred
as
to
the
widow.
and
since
it
was
a
joint
action,
the
bar
of
the
statute
as
to
the
widow
plaintiff
was
also
a
barred
to
the
action
by
the
infant
children.
i
respectfully
submit
that
is
--
that
is
directly
in
point.
but
what
the
petitioners
say
to
that?
they
say,
"oh,
we
recognize
those
decisions."
but
they're
asking
this
court
to
disregard
and
they
say
they're
old
cases.
well,
i
don't
think
that
1930
or
1936
are
necessarily
old
but
if
they'd
be
old,
california
has
answered
that
too
and
said
in
two
other
cases.
and
the
first
to
those
is
gates
against
wendling
nathan
co.
27
ca
2d
307.
that
was
decided
in
1938.
and
in
that
case,
i'm
reading
from
page
20
of
our
brief,
is
what
the
court
said,
"the
further
contention
that
the
statute
has
not
run
because
one
of
the
plaintiffs
is
a
minor.
it's
squarely
answered
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
haro
v.
southern
pacific
railroad
following
sears
v.
majors
104
cal.app.
60."
those
are
the
two
cases
i've
just
referred
to.
here
in
1938,
same
california
appellate
court
is
risk
--
is
--
is
making
--
it's
basing
its
decision
on
exactly
those
two
cases
which
petitioners
say
are
--
are
old
cases.
then
again,
we
have
another,
if
that's
--
1938
is
too
late,
we
have
another
case
in
1956,
the
case
of
caraway
against
burns
143
ca
2d
328.
now,
this
was
an
action
by
a
--
by
a
married
woman
for
personal
injuries.
the
court
ruled
that
her
action
was
barred
before
she
became
21
because
as
a
married
woman,
she
was
of
the
age
of
majority
when
she
reached
the
age
of
18
years,
and
that
her
action
was
barred
by
the
one-year
statute
of
limitations.
the
court's
rule
was
specifically
based
upon
the
haro
case
which
the
petitioner
said
it's
an
old
case.
here,
it
is
again,
reinstated
in
1956.
now,
in
that
particular
caraway
against
burns
case,
again
the
court
said
and
it
referred
to
an
earlier
case.
it
said
that,
"a
woman
of
18
years
of
age
and
being
married
is
an
adult."
so
that,
we
have
the
situation
clearly
that
the
woman
18
is
an
adult
and
in
california.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
in
two
of
them
and
in
the
sears
case,
that
sears
against
majors
and
on
the
haro
case.
petitions
of
the
appellants
to
have
their
cases
heard
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
were
denied.
in
the
--
in
their
official
report
in
sears
--
sears
against
majors,
there's
a
footnote
showing
as
the
--
the
addendum
rather
showing
if
that
happened.
in
the
haro
case,
we
find
that
in
the
reference
of
caraway
--
caraway
against
burns
which
we
quoted
in
--
in
our
brief
on
page
12.
yes,
that's
right.
see
here
in
caraway
against
burns
that
the
court
is
saying,
"the
point
was
decided
against
plaintiff's
contention
in
haro
v.
southern
pacific.
a
wrongful
death
action
by
a
widow
19
years
old
when
her
husband
died,
instituted
more
than
one
year
after
his
death
but
before
she
reached
the
age
of
21."
the
court
held
that
the
phrase,
"transaction
respecting
property"
in
civil
code
section
25
includes
the
bringing
of
an
action
for
wrongful
death.
that
she,
therefore,
was
under
no
disability
preventing
her
to
bring
the
action
at
anytime
during
the
year
following
his
death
and
that
at
the
end
of
that
year,
the
action
was
barred
by
the
statute.
the
supreme
court
denied
a
hearing.
appellant's
attacks
on
this
decision
and
her
contention
that
has
lost
authority
because
of
an
amendment
made
in
1953
in
section
25
supra
are
without
merit.
so,
to
that
california
court
obviously
would've
said
petitioner's
argument
here
that
they
were
out
of
date
which
without
marriage.
now,
as
to
whether
an
intermediate
court's
opinion,
rather
the
supreme
court
should
be
recognized
in
the
case
of
this
kind.
well,
this
court
has
said
that
it
should
in
--
in
fidelity
union
trust
company
against
field,
311
u.s.
169.
mr.
justice
hughes
in
delivering
the
opinion
of
the
court
said,
"an
intermediate
state
court
in
declaring
and
applying
the
state
law,
is
acting
as
an
organ
of
the
state,
and
its
determination
in
the
absence
of
more
convincing
evidence
of
what
the
state
law
is,
should
be
followed
by
a
federal
court
in
deciding
a
state
question."
i
haven't
cited
that
case
in
our
brief
but
i
had
just
made
a
note
of
it.
now,
as
to
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
that
case
is
fidelity
union
trust
company
v.
field
311
u.s.
169,
at
pages
177-178.
now,
petitioners
placed
great
reliance
on
the
case
of
emery
against
emery
and
deason
against
jones
are
in
the
first
place.
i
--
i
would
like
to
respectfully
point
out
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
reason
california
--
the
reason
california
by
the
law
of
its
--
the
domicile
was
that
the
domicile
in
that
case
was
california
and
they
did
it
for
a
very
special
reason.
in
the
first
place,
the
emery
case
was
a
suit
by
a
mother
and
two
daughters
brought
against
the
father
and
his
son,
arising
out
of
an
automobile
accident
in
idaho.
the
father
was
the
owner
of
the
car.
the
son
was
the
driver
of
the
car.
now,
the
question
arose
as
to
whether
or
not
situation
like
that
--
that
involved
a
family
relationship,
there
was
the
key
to
the
whole
question.
that
involved
a
family
relationship
whether
or
not
california
was
going
to
apply
idaho
law
or
its
own
law.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
the
fact
that
of
--
the
fact
of
a
mother
and
two
children
was
suing
the
father
and
a
daughter
--
and
a
son
whether
or
not
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
--
that
was
against
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
--
public
policy.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well
the
--
the
idaho
law
would
not
have
let
them
do
it.
whereas
in
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
believe
that's
what
it
was.
i
--
i
believe
it
was
entirely
questioned
advice.
and
--
and
california
said,
"this
whole
family
domiciled
in
california."
they
said,
"therefore,
because
of
the
--
and
that
this
is
--
this
is
taken
right
from
the
decision.
they
said,
"we
think
that
disabilities
to
sue
and
immunities
from
suit
because
of
a
family
relationship
are
more
properly
determined
by
reference
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
the
family
domicile."
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
13
of
petitioners'
brief.
they
quoted
that
length.
i
--
i
think
that
that's
the
key
to
the
whole
decision
on
emery
against
emery.
and
they
also
pointed
out
that
if
you
--
if
you
didn't
consider
capacity
from
a
--
from
a
family
relationship
in
that
sense,
if
every
time
--
every
time
that
a
family
were
driving
from
state
to
state,
the
question
of
family
relationship
so
forth
might
be
changed.
now,
that
was
the
--
a
sense
about
emery
decision
and
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
what
were
faced
with
here.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
state
of
the
emery
decision?
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
believe
it's
later
your
honor.
no
ever,
it's
--
it's
1955
so
that
it's
--
it's
earlier
than
the
caraway
case
because
caraway
was
1956.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
no,
that's
in
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
no
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
no,
they
were
not
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
they
were
not
your
honor.
in
this
emery
case,
they
didn't
refer
to
any
of
those
cases
that
i
referred
to.
it
was
court
of
appeals
cases
and
the
later
case
that
they
refer
to
the
emery
case.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
two
of
our
cases
were
earlier
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
--
your
honor
and
--
and
three
of
our
cases
were
early
and
one
was
later.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
they
did
not.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
no,
it
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
that's
right.
they
didn't
consider
--
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
thought
the
emery
case
related
to
this
particular
statute
with
the
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
that
was
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
the
california
court
of
appeals,
all
--
all
four.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
no,
i
--
i
think
your
honor
this
emery
case
--
the
--
the
question
i
--
i
think
it
was
more
or
less
a
question
of
capacity
to
sue
based
on
a
family
relationship
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
i
think
the
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
think
these
other
four
cases
was
not
a
question
of
capacity
to
sue.
it
was
a
whether
a
cause
of
action
existed.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
and
whether
the
cause
of
action
was
barred.
and
i
think
that's
somewhat
different.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
for
instancy,
i
--
i
mean
like,
take
this
case
of
deason
against
jones,
the
second
case
which
they
referred
to.
the
--
in
that
case
--
in
that
case,
oklahoma,
originally,
this
infant
had
been
domiciled
and
was
a
resident
of
oklahoma.
and
while
he
was
there,
he
was
authorized
and
empowered
to
transact
business
as
though
he
was
over
the
age
of
majority.
then
he
moved
to
california
and
before
he
was
21,
he
and
california
made
a
contract
to
purchase
him
property.
and
apparently,
this
didn't
turn
out
so
well.
so
when
he
was
sued
respect
to
it,
he
disaffirmed
the
contract.
he
was
still
an
infant.
and
the
california
court
said,
"here
now,
he's
a
resident,
the
citizen
domiciled
in
california.
he's
no
longer
in
oklahoma."
they
said,
"in
that
case,
we
will
apply
our
own
law
because
he's
domiciled
here,
because
the
contract
is
made
here
and
everything
pertained
to
it."
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes,
they
--
they
did.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
in
those
two
--
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
now,
there
was
also
and
--
and
seeing
the
way
california,
i
suppose
it's
a
community
property
state
california
or
is
a
pioneer
in
that
--
in
that
--
with
that
court,
and
they
have
slightly
different
conceptions
of
thing.
for
instance,
in
(inaudible)
case
that
cited
by
petitioners.
this
is
a
california
appellate
court
decision.
now,
that
--
that
brought
up
this
question,
there
--
the
husband
--
there
was
a
husband
and
wife
who
were
domiciled
in
ontario,
and
they
were
driving
an
automobile
in
california
and
there
was
an
accident.
and
the
question
that
came
up
was
whether
california
incidentally
had
a
--
a
rule
that
if
one
other
parties
was
guilty
of
contributory
negligence
the
--
that
negligence
would
be
imputed
to
the
spouse.
and
therefore,
they
wouldn't
--
and
the
reason
for
was
that
in
california,
a
husband
would
have
an
interest
in
the
wife's
recovery,
and
the
wife
would
have
an
interest
in
a
--
in
a
husband's
recovery.
but
there
the
california
court
looked
to
see
what
the
law
was
in
the
domicile,
in
ontario,
and
they
found
that
ontario
didn't
have
any
such
rule.
and
so,
they
said
that
therefore,
they
would
not
apply
california's
rule
and
impute
to
negligence
of
the
one
to
the
other.
but
the
court
conceded
that
had
they
been
domiciled
in
california,
the
result
would
be
different.
now,
that's
what
that
case
stands
for.
and
again,
i
--
i
submit
that
it
does
not
touch
upon
--
not
one
of
those
three
cases
touch
upon
the
problem
of
which
--
which
we
are
concerned
here.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
we
have
not
found
any
case.
we
have
not
cited
any
nor
have
petition.
there
isn't
a
single
case.
the
only
one
--
the
only
cases
that
--
that
have
been
decided
in
california
on
a
subject
are
those
four
court
of
appeals
cases
and
the
fact
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
twice
denied
appeals
on
the
questions.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes
your
honor.
i
would
say
so.
now,
contrast
with
the
california
cases
relied
on
by
petitioners
that
were
just
referred
to.
there
are
cases,
smith
versus
shepler
which
is
a
court
of
appeals
case
and
biewend
versus
biewend,
that's
17
ca
2d
108.
in
the
smith
case,
the
appellate
court
said,
"it
is
true
as
to
procedure
and
pleading
the
foreign
plaintiff
appearing
in
our
courts
must
follow
the
california
law.
he
is
subject
to
the
period
of
our
statute
of
limitations
regardless
of
the
period
of
similar
statutes
in
his
jurisdiction."
and
in
the
biewend
case,
the
california
supreme
court
said,
"it
is
a
principle
of
conflict
of
laws
recognized
in
california
that
the
barring
of
a
claim
by
the
statute
of
limitations
is
a
procedural
matter
governed
by
the
law
before
them,
regardless
of
where
the
cause
of
action
arose."
now,
as
to
rule
17
(b),
which
petitioners
have
relied
upon,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
made
there
and
of
course
that
part
of
their
argument
is
that
17
(b)
first
sentence,
"the
capacity
of
an
in
--
individual,
other
than
one
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
to
sue
or
be
sued
shall
be
deter
--
determined
by
the
law
of
his
domicile."
well,
you
see
that
question
and
a
diversity
of
cases
has
been
before
this
court
on
several
occasions.
and
i
think
that
was
the
answer
to
--
in
guaranty
trust
company
v.
york.
and
in
--
not
only
in
guaranty
trust
company
against
york
but
there
was
a
--
a
much
closer
analogy
to
the
rule
question
here
in
ragan
v.
merchant's
transfer
co.,
337
u.s.
530.
now,
that
was
a
--
a
case
that
particularly
brought
up
the
---
the
question
of
whether
in
a
diversity
case,
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
number
4
was
to
govern
or
whether
the
--
whether
a
kansas
statute
was
to
govern
as
to
when
an
action
was
commenced.
under
rule
4,
an
action
has
commenced
in
a
district
court
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint.
and
under
the
kansas
statute,
it's
commenced
by
the
service
of
the
summons.
and
in
this
particular
ragan
case,
the
summons
was
served
--
the
complaint
was
filed
before
the
statute
of
limitations
had
expired,
but
the
summons
was
served
after
the
statute
had
expired.
and
this
court,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
ruled
that
the
state
statute
was
controlling,
and
it
also
ruled
that
filing
a
complaint
did
not
toll
the
statute.
and
let
me
just
quote
briefly
from
the
opinion
there,
at
page
534,
justice
douglas
said,
"it
is
argued
that
the
kansas
statute
and
question
is
not
an
edictal
part
of
the
kansas
statute
of
limitations.
but
the
court
of
appeals,
on
a
careful
kansas
--
of
kansas
law
has
held
to
the
contrary.
we
ordinarily
accept
the
determination
of
local
law
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
will
not
disturb
it
here."
now,
i
respectfully
submit
that
you
could
really
substitute
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
and
what
they
did
in
this
nolan
case
into
that
last
paragraph,
and
it
would
apply
completely
and
answer
completely
the
question
with
respect
to
where
the
17
(b)
applies.
now,
as
to
last
the
point
that
petitioners
raised
as
to
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
--
of
section
13
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act,
i
just
like
to
say
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
consider
that
question
i
think
back
at
1917,
and
rule
that
it
was
not
a
discrimination
against
non-resident.
and
furthermore,
in
a
somewhat
analogous
case,
i'll
admit
there
was
an
infancy
involved
but
somewhat
analogous
case
would
be
the
canadian
northern
railway
against
eggen
252
u.s.
553,
where
this
court
upheld
that
--
a
constitutionality
of
a
similar
statute,
similar
minnesota
statute.
so,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
authorities
seem
to
be
clearly
against
petitioners
here
and
the
second
circuit,
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
certainly
carefully
looked
into
new
york
law,
carefully
looked
into
california
law
before
they
arrived
at
the
decision.
and
i
submit
your
honor
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
would
--
it
will
bar
to
the
mother.
it
would
be
barred
to
the
child.
the
statute
--
the
statute
of
limitations
apply
to
the
mother,
it
will
be
considered
joint
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
--
a
joint
action.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
if
--
if
the
statute
of
limitations
in
new
york
--
if
she
brought
her
action
after
the
statute,
new
york
ran
against
her
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
you
mean
ordinarily
they're
normal
new
york
stat
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
and
if
she
had
been
a
resident
of
new
york?
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
they
would
have
applied
i
believe
the
--
instead
of
the
one-year
statute,
they
would
have
applied
the
two-year
statute
of
limitations,
your
honor.
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
it
wouldn't
--
it
would
be
--
as
far
as
--
i
mean,
as
far
as
the
mother
is
concern,
as
far
as
the
mother
is
concern
if
she
were
--
if
she
were
a
resident
of
new
york,
it
would
be
start
to
run
when
became
21.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
oh
yes,
it
would
have
been
filed,
yes
indeed.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
if
she
were
a
resident
of
new
york,
the
accident
happened
in
california
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
and
to
summary,
your
honor,
she
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
don't
think
that
the
--
i
don't
know
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
that
the
appointment
of
this
administrator
down
there
would
make
any
difference.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes,
if
you'll
look
at
section
13
of
the
new
york
civil
practice
act,
that
is
exactly
what
it
says.
it
gives
--
in
other
words,
it
says
that
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
--
which
--
whichever
is
the
long
--
yes,
the
statute
says
that,
whichever
is
the
longer
and
i
think
the
--
i
think
that
minnesota
borrowing
statute
had
somewhat
analogous
provisions.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
you
mean
where
the
person
is
arrested
in
south
carolina
now?
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
in
this
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes,
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
the
administrator
point.
it
was
a
new
york
resident
who
was
appointed
administrator
in
south
carolina?
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
don't
know
your
honor
that
i
commence
that
offhand.
it
didn't
come
up
in
this
case
thus
far.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes,
i've
--
and
judge
friendly
in
his
opinion
below,
i
think
he's
pointed
out
that
neither
side,
i
mean,
there
was
no
point
raised
by
petitioners
on
that
subject
in
the
court
below.i
think
that
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
--
in
his
opinion
raised
it
himself.
he
raised
it
himself
i
believe
in
his
opinion.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
don't
recall
whether
he
said
that
there
had
no
decision
in
that
but
he
--
he
did
decide
on
the
merits
of
the
question
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
don't
know
at
all
apparent,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
the
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
can't
think
of
one
offense
your
honor.
and
unfortunately,
since
that
hadn't
been
raised
by
the
other
side,
i
didn't
prepare
myself
on
that
particular
quote
--
point.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
yes,
i
--
i
mean
petitioners
made
no
point
of
it
here.
and
so
i
didn't
expect
to
be
confronted
with
that.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
if
it
found
that
the
law
of
california
in
doubt,
what
would
new
york
do?
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
it's
very
difficult.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
it
would
be
difficult
to
me
to
say
that
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
california
law
is
in
doubt.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
well,
i
--
i
just
rely
in
the
california
cases
that
are
right
directly
in
point
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
i
can
--
i
can
say
this,
your
honor.
i
just
thought
of
it.
i
had
a
case
in
new
york,
since
you're
asking
for
a
case.
it
involved
the
warsaw
convention
where
the
warsaw
convention
had
a
limitation
an
action
had
to
be
brought
within
two
years.
it
was
an
accident
in
brazil,
and
the
mother
was
suing
in
new
york
on
behalf
of
herself
and
on
behalf
of
her
infant
child.
i
was
--
i
representing
pan
american
airways
moved
for
summary
judgment,
came
on
before
judge
stoyer
(ph)
and
he
granted
summary
judgment.
he
said
the
action
was
barred
to
be
--
the
widow
was
to
be
barred
to
the
infant
child.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
appellate
division
first
department
and
they
unanimously
affirmed.
the
title
of
that
action
is
bochory,
b-o-c-h-o-r-y.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
b-o-c-h-o-r-y
against
pan
american
world
airways.
i
don't
remember
the
citation
but
i
can
get
it
and
leave
it
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
--
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
--
before
i
leave
here
today.
it
was
my
--
yes,
i
--
i
remember
that
very
distinctly
because
that
argument
was
a
--
but
there
again,
it
shows
the
--
and
--
and
judge
stoyer
(ph)
as
i
remember
the
opinion
of
the
lower
court.
he
referred
to
the
law
of
new
york
on
that
subject,
so
that
in
that
sense,
as
far
as
the
action
being
joint,
the
divisible
is
the
same
in
new
york
as
it
would
be
in
--
as
what
in
california,
as
expressed
in
the
haro
case.
mr.
william
j.
junkerman
thank
you
very
much.
