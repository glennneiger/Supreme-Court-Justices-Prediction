justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there's
--
does
the
lower
court
pointed
out
in
the
emery
case,
didn't
california,
metaphysically
and
clearly
apply
for
the
rule
in
that
case
because
of
the
special
class
of
--
where
family
relationship
were
involved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
know
but,
of
course
it
takes
the
wife
in
marrying,
but
that
particular,
the
emery
case
is
a
particular
situation
that
california
said,
when
a
husband
sues
his
wife
or
a
wife
sues
her
husband,
let's
look
to
the
place
where
they
belong,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they've
said
it
in
that
specific
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
and
that
this
court
to
do
is
to
draw
from
that,
to
have
whether
it
was
to
ask,
is
to
have
--
had
the
courts
below
draw
a
general
california
principle
out
of
that.
and
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
deason
cases,
as
i
think
the
court
below
said
much
more
on
the
other
side
than
on
your
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
won't
have
here
to
be
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
maybe
both
of
them
are
very
competent
to
pass
on
what
is
california
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
think
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
infant
doesn't
protect
itself,
but
the
guardian
ad
litem
protects
whatever
the
infant
have.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
the
(inaudible)
of
a
guardian
ad
litem
here,
it
still
doesn't
take
care
of
the
infancy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
--
even
will
if
the
guardian
ad
litem,
you
said,
that
doesn't
take
care
of
the
infancy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
was
suggesting
that
during
that
tolling
period,
guardian
ad
litem
is
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
you
said
even
if
it's
tolled
nevertheless
the
period
is
--
is
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
protected
i
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
objection
is
not
that
they
didn't
look
closely,
but
they
misinterpreted
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
cited
any
cases
that
they
haven't
cited
in
california,
on
any
other
confessed
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
for
the
court
--
it
shouldn't
fail
to
consider
them
with
the
different
view
of
--
of
what
california
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
you
--
when
can
you
say
--
what
are
we
reviewing
here,
are
we
reviewing
california
law
or
are
we
reviewing
the
new
york
court
prescribing
what
california
law
is?
what
are
we
reviewing
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
we
sitting
here
as
an
independent
judge
of
california
law
or
are
we
reviewing
whether
new
york
court
would
be
entitled
to
trying
a
california
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
you
are
very
different.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
that's
why.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
sitting
here
at
the
new
york
court
trying
to
find
out
what
california
law
is.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
--
let's
see
if
we
agree.
the
new
york
district
court
and
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
fit
to
ascertain
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
albany
would
find
to
be
the
california
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
are
reviewing
here
whether
on
the
materials
available,
the
new
york
--
the
federal
courts
were
allowedly
describing
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
would
--
would
say
that
california
law
is
that
which
they
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
bearing
on
that,
we'd
go
on
step
further
--
as
bearing
on
that,
the
way
the
new
york
of
appeals
--
new
york
court
for
about
ascertaining
foreign
law
entered
into
the
way
new
york
looks
upon
foreign
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
to
be
specific,
if
these
are
all
new
york
judges.
were
they
all?
yes,
they
are
all
new
york
judges
and
they
known
what
respect
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
gives
to
what
is
concededly
a
dictum.
i'm
not
talking
about
this
particular
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
method
by
which
courts
go
about,
reaching
a
result
as
to
what
the
law
is.
some
state
courts
have
had
deference
to
deliver
dictum.
some
state
courts
pay
no
attention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
state
courts
take
account
as
to
the
--
of
the
time
and
its
relevant
decision
would've
decided.
and
take
it
into
account
the
effects
that
general
laws
so
to
speak.
the
law
of
most
states
would
have
upon
being
able
--
in
bringing
about
an
erosion
of
time,
etcetera.
all
those
are
considerations
in
ascertaining
what
law
is,
because
law
isn't
something
you
get
by
adopting
an
(inaudible)
of
slot
issues.
the
law
is
what
you
get
as
a
result
of
a
process
of
thinking
and
reasoning
in
ways.
i
don't
think
we
disagree
to
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there's
no
question
here
about
the
capacity
to
sue,
the
question
--
nobody
doubts
capacity,
the
question
is
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
is
run.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
not
a
controversy
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
guess
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
this
is
the
real
question
whether
--
whether
new
york
had
a
right
to
ensue
that
if
california
deemed
18-year
old
wives
controverts
would
sue,
he
wouldn't
--
would
have
civil
standard
upon
why
there's
domicile
elsewhere.
that's
the
real
question.
how
you
construe
the
quality
of
that
--
not
how
you
arrive
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
the
new
york
--
how
those
new
york
federal
judges?
what
they
attributed,
what
they
had
a
right
to
attribute,
that
to
attribute
something
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
to
attribute
something
to
california
because
there's
no
explicit
decision
on
the
point,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
another
question
is
whether
these
new
york
federal
judges
had
a
right
to
impugn
to
the
state
judges
of
new
york
that
they
would
construe
the
statute
of
california
which
said
at
18
should
become
mature.
differently,
if
it's
out
of
statewide,
that's
the
real
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
with
california
but
with
the
new
york
law
--
new
york
judges
attribute
that
to
california
because
california
hasn't
spoke
explicitly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
would
--
what
prevail
you
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
whom?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
constitutional
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
whom?
privileges
and
immunities,
whose
privileges
and
immunities?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
what
--
the
constitution
doesn't
says
the
wife
and
child.
the
constitution
--
give
you
some
class.
well,
what
is
the
class?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
new
york
statute
doesn't
differentiate
between
citizens
and
non-citizens.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
differentiates
between
residents
and
non-residents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
not?
but
that's
exactly
what
the
statute
says
and
that
put
lots
of
statute
differentiate
between
residents
and
citizens
so
that
a
citizen
of
new
york,
not
a
resident
is
not
within
this
new
york
statute
of
limitations.
we
have
no
rules
of
any
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
we
would
have
to
overrule
a
lot
of
case
--
not
a
lot,
several
cases
which
--
which
point
out
the
distinction
that
a
state
makes
between
applying
a
statute
of
limitations
or
other
right
as
to
resident,
whether
it's
old
resident,
whether
it's
own
citizens
or
not
and
as
to
residents
whether
the
citizenship
from
another
state
or
not.
so,
how
did
it
come
within
the
privileges
and
immunities
for
citizenship
cause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
we
should
delete
the
word
"citizen"
from
the
constitution,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
constitution
says
citizens,
and
the
citizen
is
a
definite
legal
conception
and
a
resident
maybe
a
resident
and
citizen,
or
a
resident
and
a
non-citizen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
you
say
you
didn't
find
any?
there
are
thousands
of
cases
that
are
tried
in
the
trial
court
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
so-called
supreme
court
of
that
state,
it
never
get
beyond
the
supreme
court.
they're
on
trial
there.
how
--
how
can
anybody
tell
what
happens
in
those
courts
when
they
don't
reach
the
appellant
division,
get
along
to
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
constitution
which
makes
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
residents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
asking
us
to
ignore
the
very
basic
distinction
which
the
constitution
made
as
in
equality
of
treatment
of
citizens
but
not
equality
of
treatment
of
residents
and
non-residents.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
state
of
the
emery
decision
in
relation
to
the
decision
that
you're
relying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
early
or
later?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whichever
--
whichever
decision
or
accept
that
decision.
it's
earlier
or
later
than
the
other
decisions.
it's
either
one
or
the
other
forced
to
choose.
but
the
earlier
decision
referred
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
either
in
the
family
relation
decision
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
an
earlier
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't
have
referred
to
them
unless
you
tell
me
that
they're
earlier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could've
referred
to
the
earlier
ones,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
later
case
referred
to
the
emery
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
believed
that
in
the
different
case
of
each
one
has
separate
ways
in
california?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
latest
case
that
you
have
found
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
that
may
fairly
be
said
to
deal
with
this
problem,
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
gave
some
--
some
substantial
manifestation
of
its
mind
on
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
--
does
that
imply
that
both
counsels
had
--
(inaudible)
so
that
implied
of
both
counsel
have
resorted
with
the
conventional
way
of
finding
out
what
opinions
has
been
written
by
supreme
court
of
a
state
in
a
case
which
is
essentially
a
problem
of
state
law?
