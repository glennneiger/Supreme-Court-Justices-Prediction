justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
little
orientation
here,
i
understand
that
this
death
occurred
in
california.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
california
has
a
wrongful
death
statute
that
used
the
cause
of
action
to
the
heirs
or
personal
representatives
of
the
misleading
heir.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
man
left
a
wife
and
a
child?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
wife
at
the
time
was
17
years
old.
now,
i
would
like
to
know
--
the
action
was
not
brought
within
a
year
or
date
of
death,
i'd
still
like
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
several
years
after?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
under
the
california
law
is
the
widow
and
heir?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
she
then
may
sue
as
an
heir.
she
doesn't
give
cover
through
a
legal
representative
and
does
a
trust
recovery.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
my
state,
a
widow
is
not
an
heir.
and
--
but
you
say
she
is
in
california?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
in
california
has
also
said
that
the
cause
of
action
--
it's
that
statute
creates
as
a
joint
one,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it's
barred
as
to
one
of
the
beneficiaries,
it's
barred
as
to
all.
is
that
what
they
hold?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
oriented
now.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
would
be
the
situation?
i'm
curious.
i
have
not
on
experience
in
my
background.
it
leads
me
to
ask
this
question.
what
would
be
the
situation
if
the
legal
representative
brought
the
suit
within
the
year
on
behalf
of
the
heirs
and
the
heirs
including
both
the
widow
and
the
child?
then,
it
appeared
later
that
a
release
had
been
given
by
the
widow,
would
that
defeat
the
right
of
child
order
of
the
administrator
to
continue
that
action
for
the
benefit
of
the
child
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
on
the
law
of
california?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
only
difference
between
my
hypothesis
and
yours
is
that
yours
--
the
one
you're
using
is
that
contributory
negligence
barred
to
recovery
of
one.
and
in
my
hypothesis,
it's
a
release
that
does
so.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
or
perhaps,
maybe
if
you're
sitting
here
in
review
of
the
(inaudible)
is
whether
or
not,
they
reached
with
(inaudible)
the
new
york
law
reached,
but
the
california
law
(inaudible)
