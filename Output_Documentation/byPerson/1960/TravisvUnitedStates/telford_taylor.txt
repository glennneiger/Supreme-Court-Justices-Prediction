mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
it
involves
an
appeal
from
a
conviction
for
filing
false
affidavits
under
the
taft–hartley
law,
false
non-communist
affidavits.
section
9
(h)
of
the
taft–hartley
law,
since
repealed
is
the
statute
proscribing
that
such
affidavit
shall
be
filed
by
the
officers
of
unions
which
wished
to
utilize
the
provisions
of
the
taft–hartley
law.
the
statutes
under
which
he
petitioner
was
tried
and
convicted
are
the
same
as
those
that
were
involved
in
two
cases
that
had
been
here
three
or
four
years
ago,
the
jencks
case
and
the
ben
gold
case.
although
the
questions
that
are
involved
in
this
case
are
on
the
whole
different
from
the
ones
involved
there.
there
are
in
fact
one
or
two
questions
that
overlap
--
that
were
in
gold
and
will
recur
in
this
case.
now,
i
should
explain
at
the
outset
that
this
case
has
three
numbers
but
it's
all
one
case.
the
appeal
from
the
conviction,
which
is
the
main
part
of
the
case,
is
number
10
and
the
record
in
number
10
is
contained
in
these
two
some
of
the
ponderous
volumes.
after
the
petitioner
was
convicted,
there
were
two
separate
motions
made
for
a
new
trial
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence.
and
those
motions
were
separately
denied
by
the
trial
court
and
separately
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
separately
petitioned
for
here
and
that
is
why
they
bear
different
numbers.
numbers
3
and
71
are
the
certiorari
--
the
writs
running
to
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
denying
those
motions
for
a
new
trial.
but
the
main
part
of
the
case
and
the
main
problems
are
those
associated
with
the
--
the
appeal
from
the
conviction
itself
which
is
in
number
10
with
a
two
volume
records.
mr.
telford
taylor
tenth
circuit.
mr.
telford
taylor
to
break
up
that
way?
mr.
telford
taylor
well,
there
was
a
question
in
10
here.
actually,
the
first
motion
for
a
new
trial
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
before
it
affirmed
the
appeal
from
the
conviction
itself.
the
--
it
took
them
longer
to
decide
the
appeal
and
therefore,
they
denied
the
first
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
they
didn't
all
go
up
together.
the
--
the
motion
for
the
first
new
--
first
motion
for
new
trial
went
up
and
is
acted
--
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
was
acted
on
before
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
must
ask
the
counsel.
they
got
up
there
after
the
main
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
it's
decided
sooner.
that's
again
why
the
first
motion
has
an
earlier
number
than
the
main
appeal,
why
it's
got
number
3
and
the
main
appeal
number
10.
now,
the
petitioner
was
in
fact
tried
twice.
his
conviction
after
the
first
--
his
conviction
after
the
first
trial
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
on
grounds
that
are
no
longer
relevant
here.
and
it
had
to
do
with
certain
evidentiary
rules
in
the
trial
and
those
questions
are
no
longer
in
the
case.
the
appeal
from
the
second
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
with
judge
murrah
dissenting.
and
the
questions
that
are
presented
by
our
petition
with
one
exception
are
all
questions
relating
to
events
at
the
trial.
the
various
matters
pertaining
to
the
trial
proceedings,
that
one
exception
being
the
question
of
venue
which
i
will
be
dealing
with
first
after
a
little
more
about
the
case
itself.
i
will
have
occasion
later
on
to
refer
to
the
certain
portions
of
the
evidence
with
some
particularity
but
i
think
at
the
outset,
a
very
brief
statement
of
what
this
case
is
about
will
be
--
will
be
enough.
the
details
of
the
evidence
were
of
course
quite
different
but
in
the
large,
the
case
is
not
unlike
the
ben
gold
case.
it's
not
unlike
it
in
this
sense
that
the
petitioner
here,
like
gold,
was
an
open
and
avowed
member
of
the
communist
party
and
openly
avowed
his
membership
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
taft–hartley
law.
and
again,
like
gold,
the
taft–hartley
launched
at
the
fact
and
couple
years
thereafter,
the
petitioner
issued
a
public
statement
in
which
he
said
that
he
was
resigning,
that
he
had
resigned
from
the
communist
party
for
the
specific
purpose
of
enabling
him
to
maintain
his
status
as
a
union
officer
so
that
he
could
then
file
an
non-communist
affidavit
and
his
union
would
have
compliance
state
as
under
national
labor
relations
board.
and
after
having
made
that
public
statement
that
he
was
resigning
from
the
communist
party,
he
did
sign
non-communist
affidavits.
they
were
filed
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
the
compliance
status
was
obtained.
and
therefore,
the
ultimate
question
for
the
jury
here
was
whether
despite
that
statement
of
public
--
that
public
statement
of
resignation,
the
petitioner
had
maintained
a
clandestine
relation
or
connection
with
communist
party
amounting
to
membership
or
affiliation.
i
should
say
too
that
the
petitioner
here
had
been
an
employee
of
this
union,
the
international
union
of
mine,
mill
and
smelter
workers
for
a
number
of
years
and
he
became
secretary
of
treasurer
in
1948
and
that
was
the
office
he
occupied
at
the
time
he
signed
these
affidavits
though
he
no
longer
does.
the
headquarters
of
this
union
which
is
the
principal
union
dealing
with
nonferrous
metals,
headquarters
is
in
denver
and
the
petitioner's
statement
of
resignation
from
the
communist
party,
which
is
in
exhibit
in
the
record
here,
i'll
refer
to
it
later
on,
was
issued
in
august,
1949
about
two
years
after
the
taft–hartley
law
took
effect.
as
i've
already
mentioned
that
the
provision
of
the
taft–hartley
law
requires
these
affidavits,
and
it's
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
what
the
affidavit
must
cover
is
a
specific
denial
of
communist
party
membership,
a
denial
of
affiliation,
and
a
further
denial
that
the
--
that
the
defiant
is
not
a
member
of
and
he
does
not
support
any
organization
that
believes
and/or
teaches
the
overthrow
of
governments.
the
two
affidavits
on
which
the
indictment
is
based
here
were
filed
respectively
in
december,
1951
and
december,
1952.
and
these
affidavits
were
executed
by
the
defiant
in
denver.
they
were
then
combined
with
the
other
--
the
affidavits
of
the
other
union
officers
and
were
sent
under
cover
of
a
letter
from
the
union
presidents
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
washington
where
they
were
received
and
filed
in
the
offices
here,
a
word
about
the
indictment
which
recurs
on
the
first
four
pages
of
the
big
record.
the
court
will
see
that
it
originally
contains
six
counts.
the
first
three
counts
were
based
on
the
1951
affidavit.
the
second
three
counts
were
based
on
the
1952
affidavit.
the
first
count
charged
a
false
statement
as
to
the
membership.
the
second
count,
a
false
statement
as
to
the
affiliation
and
the
third
count
charged
that
he
in
fact
kind
of
supported
an
organization
that
talk
about
overthrow.
and
counts
four
and
five
and
six
were
the
same,
except
they
related
to
the
second
affidavit
in
1952.
now,
we
only
have
left
in
the
case
count
one,
two,
four
and
five
because
one
--
one,
two
--
yes,
that's
right.
because
counts
three
and
six
which
are
the
support
counts
were
dismissed
by
the
government
before
a
trial
and
so
they
played
no
part
in
the
proceedings.
the
petitioner
was
nonetheless
convicted
on
these
four
counts
that
remained.
the
two
counts
on
membership
and
affiliation
relating
to
the
1951
affidavit
and
the
two
on
membership
and
affiliation
relating
to
the
1952
affidavit,
and
he
got
four
years
on
each
count
but
the
membership
and
affiliation,
counts
one
and
two
on
the
1951
affidavit
ran
concurrently
and
the
two
counts
on
the
1952
affidavit
where
it
began
after
that,
so
he's
got
eight
years
to
serve
in
all
in
the
sentences
on
the
counts
and
then
he
was
also
fined
on
the
membership
counts
but
not
on
the
affiliation
counts.
now,
as
i
have
said
all
but
one
of
the
issues
pertaining
to
proceedings
in
the
trial
court.
let
me
just
mention
in
advance
or
we're
coming
back
to
them,
two
of
these
issues
that
are
maybe
especially
important.
one
of
them
is
the
question
of
access
to
grand
jury
minutes
and
the
questions
there
grow
out
of
questions
dealt
within
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass
case.
and
another
question
is
whether
the
special
rules
on
pardon
of
proof
in
perjury
cases
should
be
applied
--
should
or
should
not
be
applied
here,
the
so
called
"two
witness
rule."
this
has
not
been
a
technical
perjury
case
but
nonetheless
involving
a
false
statement.
the
issue
was
whether
those
rules
peculiar
to
perjury
should
be
applied
here.
that
question
was
before
the
court
when
the
gold
case
came
up
and
was
briefed
and
fully
argued
when
the
gold
case
was
here,
although
the
court
didn't
pass
on
it
because
they
sent
it
back,
here
they
reversed
that
case
on
other
grounds.
now,
these
two
points
relating
to
the
grand
jury
minutes
and
perjury
rule
are
the
two
matters
on
which
judge
murrah
dissented
below.
there
are
several
other
questions
pertaining
to
the
trial,
couple
of
them
growing
out
of
the
jencks
statute
and
then
there
are
of
course
these
questions,
count
with
the
--
the
question
of
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
cases
3
and
71.
i'll
be
coming
back
to
those
but
i
want
to
deal
first
with
the
question
of
venue
and
i
want
to
deal
with
it
first
of
course
because
if
we
are
right
in
our
position
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
colorado
and
the
proper
--
the
only
proper
venue
is
here
in
washington,
then
of
course,
the
indictment
has
to
be
dismissed
and
all
these
other
questions
pertaining
to
the
trial
will
fall
away
because
that
will
--
that
would
require
a
dismissal
of
the
entire
indictment.
now,
our
challenge
to
the
venue
is
based
on
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
tried
not
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
these
affidavits
were
filed
as
they
had
to
be,
but
in
denver,
where
the
union
had
its
headquarters
and
from
where
these
affidavits
were
mailed.
and
other
things
should
be
explained
at
this
point
and
that
is
that
under
the
board's
regulations,
officers
of
local
unions
are
required
to
file
their
affidavits
at
the
regional
offices
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
the
nearby
regional
offices
or
wherever
the
nearest
one
may
be,
whereas
officers
of
national
unions
or
as
they're
more
often
called
international
unions.
they
are
required
to
file
affidavits
at
the
main
offices
of
the
labor
board
here
in
washington.
now,
in
government's
general
practice,
in
bringing
proceedings
against
people
who're
accused
for
falling
--
filing
false
affidavits,
has
been
to
bring
the
indictment
where
the
affidavit
was
filed,
not
from
where
it
was
mailed.
the
gold
case
itself
came
up
from
the
district
of
columbia
here
where
the
affidavit
was
filed,
though
gold
had
made
and
mailed
the
affidavit
from
new
york.
the
jencks
case,
jencks
was
tried
in
the
western
district
of
texas
where
the
regional
office
of
the
board
is
at
el
paso
and
not
in
new
mexico
where
he
had
been
an
officer
of
the
local
union
and
where
he
had
made
and
from
where
the
affidavit
had
been
mailed.
and
the
same
is
true
of
all
the
other
cases
except
one
and
this
one
that
the
--
that
the
indictment
has
been
brought
at
the
place
of
the
filing,
not
at
the
place
of
mailing.
in
the
present
case,
the
government
has
sought
to
establish
venue
in
denver
on
the
basis
of
the
mailing.
the
petitioner,
then
the
defendant,
made
timely
challenge
to
venue,
there's
no
question
about
that,
on
this
very
ground.
the
district
court
upheld
venue
in
colorado
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
that.
now,
that
decision
on
the
venue
is
on
the
appeal
from
the
first
conviction,
not
the
second.
and
therefore,
you
won't
find
any
mention
of
venue
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
from
which
we
are
now
coming.
and
for
some
reason,
that
first
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
in
the
records
but
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
of
course
it
is
reported
in
the
federal
court.
and
the
decision
below
sustaining
the
venue
in
colorado
is
one
of
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
dealing
with
this.
the
other
case
is
the
--
one
other
case
where
the
defendant
was
indicted
at
the
place
of
mailing
and
that
is
the
valenti
case,
which
went
to
the
third
circuit.
and
the
court
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
the
valenti
case
held
that
there
was
venue
only
at
the
place
of
filing
and
therefore,
sent
the
case
back
to
be
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
venue
was
improper.
i
should
add
that
judge
hastie,
in
the
valenti
case,
wrote
a
concurrent
opinion.
he
concurred
because
the
proof
of
mailing
was
insufficient,
but
he
expressed
views
in
his
concurrent
opinion
which
are
more
like
the
views
expressed
in
this
case
below,
whereas
judges
biggs
and
maris
held
that
venue
would
lie
only
where
the
affidavit
is
filed.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
valenti
case
was
rightly
decided
and
the
decision
below
is
wrong
and
that
there's
venue
only
here
in
washington.
and
i
think
in
addressing
myself
to
this
issue,
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
state
first
that
part
of
the
analysis
on
which
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
petitioner
and
the
government,
and
then
come
to
the
point
at
which
we
part
ways.
and
may
i
now
therefore
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
statutes
that
are
directly
involved
here
which
are
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
pages
1
(a)
and
2
(a).
the
third
paragraph
of
that
appendix
sets
forth
9
(h),
and
the
court
will
see
that
the
statute
specifically
says
that
the
union
can't
use
the
facilities
of
the
board
unless
there
is
an
affidavit
on
file,
unless
there
is
on
file
with
the
board,
an
affidavit.
that's
in
the
third
line
on
the
top
of
page
2
(a).
so
the
requirement
is
expressly
placed
on
the
filing
then.
now
then,
the
penalty
is
contained
in
the
last
sentence
further
down
there.
the
provisions
of
section
35
(a)
of
the
criminal
code
shall
be
applicable
in
respect
to
such
affidavits,
meaning
clearly
affidavits
which
are
on
file
with
the
board.
now,
35
(a)
of
the
criminal
code
has
been
since
broken
down
into
a
number
of
different
code
provisions
but
the
one
that's
involved
here
is
set
forth
on
page
1
(a)
just
back
of
the
page,
18
u.s.
code
101,
that's
the
well
known
false
statements
statute
which
makes
it
an
offense
to
make
or
use
a
false
statement
in
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
government
agency.
mr.
telford
taylor
not
that
i
know
of.
the
--
the
sentence
with
35
(a)
and
to
the
best
of
knowledge
came
in
to
deal
with
the
time.
mr.
telford
taylor
35
(a)
is
no
longer
the
governing
statutory
reference
as
the
code
explains.
now,
there's
no
doubt
that
there
is
no
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
the
board
until
the
affidavit
gets
there
and
there's
no
doubt
that
what
--
that
what
is
made
an
offense
here
is
the
--
is
the
filing.
the
government
doesn't
dispute
any
of
that.
it's
also
plain
enough
that
congress
was
not
concerned
about
union
officers
generally
speaking
made
any
falls
at
affidavits.
the
only
thing
they
are
concerned
about
was
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
if
it
was
used
as
a
representation
for
the
board
and
filed
there
in
order
to
get
compliance
status.
the
essence
the
crime
here
is
the
filing
and
there's
no
crime
unless
it
is
filed,
and
i
don't
understand
whether
the
government
disputes
any
of
that.
it's
equally
plain
that
the
one
and
only
place
that
this
affidavit
could
properly
be
filed
was
washington.
the
boards'
regulations
which
the
government's
brief
refers
to
and
the
instructions
on
the
back
of
the
affidavits
themselves,
say
to
the
place
to
file
these
affidavits
is
the
affidavit
compliance
branch
washington
d.c.
you
could
not
get
compliance
--
you
have
to
file
this
affidavit
in
washington
if
you're
a
national
officer
as
the
petitioner
was.
and
finally,
there's
no
dispute
that
there
is
venue
to
prosecute
this
offence
here
in
washington.
the
government
couldn't
dispute
that
because
as
i
say
in
every
other
case
except
this
and
one
other,
they
have
prosecuted
the
defendants
at
the
place
of
filing
and
anyhow
they
don't
dispute
it.
so,
this
is
not
a
problem
of
venue
in
washington
or
in
colorado.
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
venue
in
washington.
and
the
only
issue
is
whether
this
is
a
case
of
multiple
venue
and
that
the
petitioner
can
be
tried
in
colorado
as
well
as
in
washington.
and
that
is
now
the
point
at
which
the
government
and
the
petitioner
diverge.
the
government
sets
that
there
is
additional
venue
in
colorado
under
the
statute
that
the
court
will
find
set
out
on
the
very
last
page
of
our
brief,
appendix
page
6
(a).
that
is
18
u.s.
code
3237,
the
commonly
referred
to
as
the
continuing
offence
statute.
the
first
paragraph
of
that
is
the
–
it
has
been
on
the
books
a
long,
long
time
and
that
is
the
governing
paragraph
here
from
the
government's
view
point.
it
specifies,
the
court
will
see,
that
any
offence
which
has
begun
in
one
district
can
complete
it
in
another
or
committed
in
more
than
one
maybe
in
part
and
persecuted
it
in
any
district
in
which
such
offense
was
begun
or
completed.
just
for
clarity,
let
me
say
that
the
second
paragraph
has
no
bearing
here.
that
second
paragraph
has
been
added
later
and
that
is
restricted
in
this
application
to
offenses
in
which
the
use
of
the
mails
or
challenge
an
interstate
commerce
as
the
essence
of
the
offence.
that
was
passed
after
this
court's
decision
in
the
johnson
case,
but
it
has
no
bearing
here.
the
question
which
the
government's
position
raises
is
whether
this
offense
was
begun
in
colorado
within
the
meaning
of
that
first
paragraph.
we
say
that
that
this
offense
was
a
single
offense
of
filing.
that
it
wasn't,
in
a
legal
sense,
begun
anywhere
else,
and
that
under
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
jurisdiction
in
colorado.
and
as
authority
for
our
position,
what
we
rely
on
primarily
is
the
long
established
rule
which
this
court
laid
down
in
the
lombardo
case,
in
241
u.s.
that
where
the
offense
relates
to
the
filing
the
thing
as
it
does
here
and
where
it
is
proscribed
by
law
where
the
document
shall
be
filed
that
there
is
venue
only
at
the
place
of
filing.
we
think
that
rule
squarely
governs
here.
i
will
make
some
couple
of
comments
in
conclusion
as
to
the
policy
considerations
at
work
here.
we
don't
think
that
--
we
think
the
policy
considerations
back
at
this
rule
are
sound
and
the
court
should
adhere
to
it
and
apply
them
here,
and
i
will
come
back
to
those
policy
grounds
in
a
few
moments.
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
first
about
3237,
18
u.s.
code
3237
that's
contained
in
the
offense
statute.
it
has
been
on
the
book
since
1867
and
it
came
into
the
statutes
at
large
along
with
the
well
known
statute
that
punishes
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense
against
the
unites
states
or
to
defraud
united
states.
they
were
born
in
a
single
paragraph
together
in
the
statute
in
1867.
therefore,
there
have
been
a
great
many
decisions
construing
this
statute.
we
have
dealt
with
those
decisions
in
our
brief
at
some
length.
we've
also
set
forth
what
little
can
be
established
from
the
legislative
history
which
is
not
enormously
helpful
either
way
on
this.
and
that
is
all
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history,
and
the
case
history
of
this
statute
and
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
take
the
court's
time
by
tracing
all
that
through.
but
two
things
do
emerge
from
the
study
of
the
background
of
3237.
one
is
that
it
clearly
was
not
intended
to
as
indeed
it
could
not
limit
a
defendant's
constitutional
right
to
be
tried
in
the
district
where
he
committed
his
offense.
and
the
second
is
that
this
statute,
except
of
that
second
paragraph,
which
relates
to
that
narrow
oppressive
offenses,
this
statute
does
not
specifically
make
any
particular
federal
offense
a
continuing
offense
or
say
that
any
particular
offense
has
a
beginning
nor
a
middle
or
an
end.
on
those
matters,
we
have
to
look
to
the
statutes,
the
criminal
statutes
themselves
to
see
what
is
the
act
that
is
proscribed
and
then
to
the
indictment
to
see
what
of
the
proscribed
acts
are
charged.
it
is
only
by
that
method
that
one
can
ascertain
whether
an
offense
is
a
continuing
one
and
therefore
has
a
beginning
which
would
--
or
in
ending
a
completion
which
separately
would
provide
a
basis
for
venue.
one
other
general
consideration,
if
the
court
please,
and
that
is
that
in
determining
the
bearing
of
the
sixth
amendment
involving
the
guarantee
of
a
right
to
trial
in
the
district
where
you
committed
the
offense.
it's
important
i
think
to
bear
in
mind
that
that
sixth
amendment
is
in
no
sense
a
restriction
on
the
power
of
congress
to
punish
criminal
acts
and
that
is
not
our
point
here.
we
have
no
doubt
that
congress
could
have
said
that
it
shall
be
an
offense
to
put
a
false
affidavit
in
the
mail
or
put
a
false
affidavit
and
challenge
an
interstate
commerce,
or
if
you
put
a
false
out
to
make
a
false
affidavit
intending
to
file
it
before
the
labor
board.
but
the
point
is,
it
hasn't
set
any
of
those
things.
it
has
put
the
criminal
impact
on
the
filing.
there
are
a
number
of
other
statutes
where
congress
has
made
a
lot
of
different
steps
in
a
chain
criminal.
for
instance,
the
statutes'
relation
to
income
tax
returns,
make
the
preparation
criminal
as
well
as
the
filing.
in
our
brief
at
page
15,
we've
referred
to
a
number
of
statutes
like
this.
there
are
statutes
that
make
it
criminal
to
post
a
ransom
letter
or
to
deposit
lottery
material
in
the
mail
or
to
transmit
false
pension
papers.
when
you
have
a
statute
like
that,
you
don't
have
any
constitutional
problem
because
there,
the
congress
has
put
the
criminal
impact
on
the
act.
it's
the
act
which
has
been
done
where
the
indictment
is
brought.
but
here,
the
criminal
impact
has
been
put
on
the
--
on
the
file,
and
we
do
get
a
constitutional
problem
and
a
problem
under
this
section
of
the
statute.
when
congress
has
punished
one
act
and
the
government
seeks
to
establish
venue
on
the
basis
of
a
different
act
committed
either
before
or
after
and
in
some
different
place.
quite
a
few
such
cases
have
been
here.
the
cores
case
was
here
not
long
ago
involving
alien
seamen
who
land
unlawfully
and
remained
in
the
country.
thus,
the
remain
constitute
a
continuing
offence.
earlier,
there
was
the
case
the
dentures
that
had
not
passed
--
had
not
been
approved
by
the
state
to
which
they
are
being
shipped,
it
was
that
offence
committed
in
two
places.
there
are
many
such
cases,
but
we
don't
have
to
really
bother
with
those
in
this
one
because
congress
has
put
the
criminal
sanction
on
the
filing,
the
place
of
the
filing
is
proscribed
by
law,
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
rule
is
well
established
and
we
think
the
lombardo
case
governs.
now,
the
lombardo
case
--
mr.
telford
taylor
the
lombardo
case
made
either
a
failure
to
file
or
a
false
filing
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
criminal
if
you
harbor
an
alien
prostitute
and
did
not
file
within
30
days
after
the
(inaudible)
began.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
seems
to
me,
justice
harlan
that
that
is
the
only
thing
that
congress
had
any
interest
in
here.
the
only
effect
in
statutory
terms
that
this
affidavit
has
is
that
when
the
labor
board
has
got
affidavits
in
its
files
from
all
the
officers
of
the
union.
at
that
point,
they
--
they
give
you
what
they
call
a
certification
of
compliant
status.
the
record
complains,
the
letter
going
back
saying,
"your
affidavits
are
here
and
now
there
is
compliance."
congress
had
absolutely
no
interest
in
whether
a
false
affidavit
was
made
or
mailed
or
anything
on
any
umber
of
subjects
except
if
it
was
filed
with
the
board
and
thereby
became
the
basis
for
compliance.
that
is
the
sole
scope
of
the
statutory
policy,
and
therefore,
i
would
say
yes
that
the
only
thing
congress
was
concerned
with
here
was
the
filing.
just
as
in
lombardo,
the
impact
was
put
entirely
on
the
filing.
and
in
that
case,
the
government
endeavored
to
make
exactly
the
same
arguments
that
are
being
made
here.
they
said
there
was
a
beginning
at
the
place
where
the
alien
--
where
the
alien
prostitute
was
harbored.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
correct.
and
the
government
and
the
court
below
had
endeavored
to
draw
a
distinction
between
a
failure
to
file
and
a
false
filing.
we
can't
see
any
basis
in
the
distinction
on
that
ground.
the
government
reasons
it
out
this
way
as
i
understand
it
that
if
you
--
that
once
you
have
put
your
false
affidavit
in
the
mails,
it's
irrevocably
out
of
your
control
and
therefore,
that's
the
place
where
the
act
is
done.
but
i
would
suppose
that
a
failure
to
file
within
the
time
limit
is
really
even
more
irrevocable
than
putting
something
in
the
mail.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
here
that
first
affidavit
took
nearly
eight
days
to
get
to
washington.
it
would
have
been
possible
for
the
union
to
telegraph
or
phone
and
say
“we're
withdrawing
our
request
for
compliant
status,
send
us
our
affidavits
back
and
disregard
this
application.”
and
at
any
event,
as
far
as
the
policy
and
reason
for
this
rule,
justice
douglas,
to
draw
a
distinction
based
on
whether
it's
misfeasance
or
nonfeasance,
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
meaning
in
terms
of
the
policies
that
are
at
work
here
which
i
would
like
to
come
to
--
come
to
now.
let
me
say
before
i
do
that
that
rule
in
the
lombardo
case
and
there's
general
rule
that
where
the
offense
is
the
filing
and
where
the
filing
placed
proscribed
by
law
that
there's
venue
only
there.
that
has
been
followed
as
far
as
i
know
consistently
since
and
before
lombardo.
there
is
no
lack
of
authority
for
that
general
principle.
the
cases
cited
by
the
government
are
cases
where
there
was
no
place
of
filing
fixed
by
law
or
as
i
indicated
the
moment
ago,
where
the
statute
did
specifically
punish
the
earlier
act
like
the
posting
(inaudible)
letter
or
the
transmitting
of
pension
papers
which
we
don't
have
here.
is
there
any
reason
to
change
the
rule?
the
government
in
its
brief
says
something
about
residents
and
endeavors
the
ground
on
argument
on
the
stack
that
the
petitioner
here,
lived
in
denver
so
that
in
the
point
of
fact,
he
was
being
tried
closer
to
home
there
than
he
would've
been
here.
well,
that
argument
has
an
initial
appeal
but
if
anything
is
well
settled
under
the
sixth
amendment,
it
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
policy
relates
to
the
locus
of
the
offense
and
not
to
the
residence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is
language
in
the
johnson
opinion
which
refers
to
being
taken
away
from
home
and
facilities
for
defense.
i
had
always
read
that
passage
as
i
thought
i
must
in
the
light
of
other
decisions
of
the
court
which
you
said
time
and
time
again
that
the
policy
here
is
a
policy
to
try
where
the
offense
is
committed
in
the
vicinage
of
the
offense
if
--
mr.
telford
taylor
the
two
are
not
inconsistent.
mr.
telford
taylor
but
the
court
has
said
specifically
that
the
residence
does
not
play
a
part
in
the
policy
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
house
against
finkle
years
ago,
and
it's
been
repeated
in
many
other
cases.
there,
it
--
however,
if
were
to
look
residence,
let
me
point
this
out
too.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
did
however
say
quite,
the
plea
there
was
made
that
he
was
being
taken
away
for
residence.
mr.
telford
taylor
by
locating
him
for
trial
where
he
committed
the
offence
and
not
somewhere
else.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
seems
to
me
the
way
they
were
seeking
to
protect
him
was
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
by
giving
him
a
right
to
trial
where
it
was
committed.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
understand.
mr.
telford
taylor
in
the
case
of
this
petitioner,
that
would
have
worked
out
if
we
came
to
the
other
conclusion
to
try
him
at
his
residence.
but
may
i
point
out,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
what
was
done
here
was
the
affidavits
of
all
the
union
officers
were
assembled
in
denver
and
mailed
to
washington.
now,
as
the
records
shows,
other
union
officers
lived
all
over
the
country
so
this
--
if
you
apply
this
principle
based
on
mailing,
you
might
in
the
case
of
this
petitioner,
happened
in
his
residence.
but
in
the
case
of
most
of
the
other
people
that
filed,
you
wouldn't
have
at
all.
they
would
have
been
living
in
cleveland
or
connecticut,
made
their
affidavit,
mailed
it
to
denver
then
it
would've
been
mailed
in
from
there.
so,
we're
going
to
make
a
triple
venue
and
have
them
where
they
live
and
where
the
union
mails
it
in
and
in
washington.
mr.
telford
taylor
i'm
supposing
not
--
mr.
telford
taylor
he
has
nothing
to
make.
mr.
telford
taylor
that
is
my
point.
mr.
telford
taylor
we
have
all
the
policy
considerations
at
work
here
that
seem
to
me
to
bear
upon
the
problem
you
raised.
and
that
is
that
if
we
do
begin
to
establish
additional
venues
based
on
beginnings
and
initiations
of
offenses
where
the
statutory
impact
is
something
else.
the
--
the
certainty
in
the
field
of
venue
is
going
to
be
very
much
reduced.
now,
the
government
of
course
likes
multiple
venue.
the
government
uses
multiple
venue
theories
to
espouse
inconsistent
positions
on
this.
we
referred
in
our
brief
to
the
kashin
(ph)
case,
recently
decided
in
the
second
circuit.
the
decision
there
itself
is
not
strictly
relevant
but
there,
the
offense
was
false
prospectuses
under
the
securities
act
which
we're
going
to
--
to
which
the
congressional
impact
attaches
if
the
mails
or
interstate
commerce
are
used.
there
was
no
question
down
there
that
the
whole
--
that
the
prospectuses
were
all
prepared
and
utilized
widely
in
louisiana,
i
think
it
was.
but
there
was
the
--
the
first
mailing
was
in
new
york
and
the
government
said
no
offense
until
it
hits
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
in
new
york.
so,
the
government,
if
you
give
them
wide
option
then
multiple
venue
can
pick
around
at
this
thing.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
real
policy
here
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
is
in
favor
of
certainty.
mr.
telford
taylor
no.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
cases
you
mentioned,
justice
frankfurter
conspiracy
and
continuing
offense
in
interstate
congress
are
the
very
ones
for
which
3237
was
devised.
it
was
born,
as
i
said,
with
the
conspiracy
statute.
it
has
been
applied
most
frequently
in
cases
where
the
use
of
the
mails
or
of
interstate
commerce
was
the
essence
of
the
offense.
and
you
--
as
you
rightly
say,
those
are
cases
where
we
cannot
avoid
the
problem.
but
we
can
avoid
it
in
cases
where
the
offense
is
fixed
and
the
court
in
the
lombardo
case
says,
"we
will
fix
it,"
where
the
filing
occurs
and
if
it's
required
to
there
and
nowhere
else.
and
that
has
been
pretty
well
followed
and
this
problem
had
been
laid
to
rest
in
the
lower
federal
courts
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
until
this
one.
mr.
telford
taylor
there,
you
had
a
particular
problem
involving
whether
a
conspiracy
is
complete
before
the
overt
acts
come
and
the
difference
of
opinion
in
the
court
which
lies
and
revolving
around
that.
there
again,
3237
was
meant
for
conspiracy
cases.
it
wasn't
meant
for
this
kind
of
case
to
submit
and
that
the
established
rule
that
we
find
in
lombardo
seems
to
me
gives
us
certainty.
it
has
been
the
question
that's
pretty
well
trashed
out
and
if
you'll
now
overturn
that
principle
here,
it
seems
to
me,
the
result
will
not
be
good
from
the
standpoint
of
general
administration.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
no.
not
--
no,
mr.
justice
black,
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
now,
i
have
taken
perhaps
more
time
than
i
meant
on
venue
and
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
problems
waiting
for
trial.
and
at
this
point,
i
think
i
should
recur
briefly
to
the
evidence,
just
to
give
the
court
a
very
brief
picture
of
what
the
evidence
here
was
like
bearing
in
mind
that
there
was
no
problem
about
his
having
been
a
communist.
this
was
admitted
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
made
a
public
statement
of
resignation.
the
test
--
the
evidence
against
him
are
consisted
four
main
parts.
there
was
a
lot
of
testimony
about
what
he
had
done
before
his
resignation
as
a
communist.
this
really
wasn't
germane
in
our
view
because
there
was
no
dispute
about
his
prior
status
of
a
communist.
then
there
was
expert
testimony
of
an
interesting
and
unusual
kind.
there
was
expert
testimony
that
the
communist
party
has
a
policy
that
no
one
can
resign
from
it,
they
can
only
be
expelled.
that
testimony
was
admitted
over
sharp
objection
and
is
one
of
the
things
that
i
will
be
coming
to
in
my
trial
points.
there
was
also
the
resignation
statement
itself
which
indicated
that
the
petitioner
continue
to
have
a
sympathetic
belief
in
communism
as
a
doctrine,
although
he
didn't
say
quite
specifically
that
he
was
resigning
from
the
party.
all
of
that
that
i
have
referred
to
so
far
was
evidence
about
things
that
happened
two
years
or
more
before
his
first
affidavit
was
filed.
and
the
only
evidence
which
is
a
total
contemporaneous
with
the
affidavits
themselves
is
the
evidence
of
approximately
six
conversations
that
travis
is
supposed
to
have
had
with
two
of
the
government's
three
witnesses.
there
were
just
three
prosecution
witnesses
and
two
of
them
testified
chiefly
about
these
conversations
that
took
place
in
1951,
1952
and
1953
which
the
government
regards
as
in
the
nature
of
admissions
of
continued
membership.
those,
therefore,
are
of
crucial
importance,
those
--
that
testimony
about
those
conversations.
and
it
is
in
the
light
of
that
kind
of
a
record
that
we
have
to
approach
these
questions
waiting
to
trial.
the
first
one
of
which
i
want
to
take
up
being
the
matter
of
the
grand
jury
minutes
because
the
defendant
here
did
request
access
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
these
three
prosecution
witnesses.
and
there
was
particular
need
for
it
here
because
of
the
fact
that
the
crucial
and
only
contemporaneous
testimony
against
him
related
to
these
conversations
that
he'd
had
with
the
two
witnesses
at
which
other
people
--
wherein
no
other
people
were
present.
so
these
were
uncorroborated
conversations.
now,
this
case
is
different
in
two
very
essential
respects
from
pittsburgh
plate
glass.
firstly,
in
that
case
as
the
court's
opinion
pointed
out,
the
defendant
was
asserting
what
he
--
what
the
court
referred
to
as
an
absolute
right
to
the
testimony
under
the
jencks
decision.
here,
we
have
no
such
assertion
of
absolute
right.
the
petitioner
appealed
to
the
trial
court's
discretion.
there
are
long
colloquies
in
the
record
in
which
petitioner's
counsel
is
pointing
out,
the
crucial
nature
of
these
conversations.
they
need
to
check
the
grand
jury
testimony
to
see
if
they
were
described
in
the
same
manner
before
the
grand
jury
as
he
had
in
court.
and
the
matter
was
thrashed
over
very
fully
with
all
kinds
of
appeals
to
the
trial
court's
discretion.
the
second
difference
is
that
the
petitioner
here
did
what
he
did
not
do
in
the
pittsburgh
plate
glass.
that
is
that
after
he
had
been
refused
when
he
requested
access
to
the
minutes.
he
then
said,
“alright,
if
you
won't
give
them
to
me,
will
the
trial
court
please
take
them
and
see
if
they
contain
anything
which
should
be
turned
over
to
me
for
impeachment
purposes."
in
other
words,
the
request
was
made
and
that
question
as
mr.
justice
clark
always
say
in
the
pittsburg
plate
glass
cases,
it's
here
now.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
second
circuit,
petitioner's
request
for
grand
jury
minutes
would
have
been
honored
almost
automatically.
indeed
it
is
probable
that
it
would
have
never
arisen
because
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
the
government
counsel
no
longer
seem
to
have
an
automatic
opposition,
turning
testimony
over.
at
--
at
the
time
of
pittsburg
plate
glass,
there
had
been
one
second
circuit
decision
to
spangle
that
case
referred
to
in
there.
since
that
time,
there's
been
a
whole
series
of
second
circuit
decisions
in
which
where
you
have
a
witness
whose
testimony
about
the
thing
in
light
of
conversation
is
important
and
where
the
particular
words
he
uses
are
important.
and
where
the
defendant
says
that,
"we
would
like
the
minutes
examined
to
see
whether
this
thing
was
described
in
the
same
way
to
the
grand
jury,"
the
testimony
is
made
available.
it
was
first
produced
in
camera
and
then
made
available
to
the
defense.
the
most
recent
such
decision
is
not
yet
reported,
the
hernandez
case,
decided
on
december
--
in
august
of
this
year.
and
that
case
cites
all
the
previous
second
circuit
decisions.
now,
may
i
just
stress
again
that
there
was
a
special
need
for
this
testimony
here.
the
--
the
contemporaneous
evidence
was
all
these
uncorroborated
conversations
and
the
wording
was
important,
the
credibility
of
the
witness
was
important.
if
the
witness
wasn't
making
it
up
out
of
ballpark,
he
still
might
be
embroidering
or
varying
these
conversations
in
a
way
that
made
it
look
more
as
if
the
petitioner
had
retained
his
clandestine
membership.
the
defense
first
made
rather
general
request
for
grand
jury
testimony
and
then
when
these
were
denied,
they
were
limited
down,
limited
down,
limited
down,
and
then
upward
request
for
just
two
of
these
conversations.
so,
the
requests
were
made
with
particularity.
nonetheless,
they
were
denied.
i
would
like
to
--
the
next
to
point
i
am
going
to
embark
and
will
take
so
long,
mr.
chief
justice,
shall
i
go
ahead?
mr.
telford
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
when
the
court
rose
for
lunch,
i
was
in
the
course
of
discussing
this
request
for
access
to
the
grand
jury
testimony
of
the
prosecution
witnesses.
and
before
concluding
on
that,
i
would
like
to
give
one
illustration
of
which
seems
to
me
to
bring
out
the
practical
importance
of
this
in
the
standpoint
of
the
--
of
the
trial.
i
mentioned
this
six
conversations
which
are
about
the
only
contemporaneous
evidence
that
indicates
--
it
could
be
taken
indicate
continued
membership
on
the
petitioner's
part,
and
one
of
those
conversations
is
described
in
the
record,
volume
1
of
the
big
record
at
page
443,
where
the
witness
gardner
who
is
one
of
the
three
prosecution
witnesses
and
who
had
been
a
fellow
employee
of
the
mine,
mill
and
smelters
workers
of
--
this
witness
gardner
was
in
cleveland.
travis
came
to
cleveland
and
he
and
travis,
the
petitioner,
made
a
trip
to
canada
together.
and
the
conversation
in
the
course
of
this
trip
is
what
is
discussed
in
those
two
paragraphs,
beginning
the
bottom
of
443
and
running
over
the
top
444.
and
in
that
first
paragraph
there,
it's
reported
that
travis
has
indicated
that
he
was
having
trouble
going
back
and
forth
across
the
border,
because
of
his
connection
with
the
communist
party
and
his
public
resignation
and
so
forth.
then
page
444
there,
gardner
says
that
he
asked
travis
if
the
--
other
unions
are
having
the
same
difficulties
and
here
is
where
the
crucial
part.
he
said,
no,
the
canadian
authorities
in
the
maine
were
putting
the
clamps
down
on
the
left
wing
union
such
as
mine,
mill
and
ue.
and
we
very
briefly
discussed
his
resignation
from
the
party
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
he
believed
that
resignation,
that
public
resignation,
was
a
mistake
because
it
gave
the
enemies
of
the
party
an
opportunity
to
use
that.
and
pointing
out
that
it
wasn't
a
true
resignation
from
the
party,
but
actually
it
was
done
to
conform
to
the
taft-harley
affidavits.
and
they
recognized,
the
enemies
of
the
party
recognized
that
this
was
not
an
actual
resignation
and
in
substance
that
is
above
what
we
discussed.
well,
the
court
will
see
that
the
wording
of
that
is
not
100%
self-explanatory.
he
doesn't
precisely
admit
that
he
was
a
member.
he
says
the
enemies
to
the
party
regarded
it
as
not
a
true
resignation.
the
government,
when
it
is
describing
this
episode
in
their
brief,
i'm
looking
at
page
52
of
the
government's
brief,
summarize
this
episode
by
saying,
"he”,
that
is
travis,
“confided
to
gardner
that
his
formal
resignation
from
the
party
in
1949
was
not
an
actual
resignation."
well,
it
may
please
(inaudible)
from
the
kind
to
begin
with,
the
word,
"formal"
isn't
used
in
there
at
all,
he
said
his
public
resignation
and
when
you
change
that
into
formal
that
is
putting
a
very
different
twist
in
meaning
on
the
--
on
the
thing.
he
said
not
a
word
about
formal
resignation
and
he
did
not
confide
that
his
--
that
it
wasn't
an
actual
resignation.
what
he
said
was
that
the
enemies
of
the
party
so
regarded.
mr.
telford
taylor
the
government
in
their
brief
in
describing
in
this
episode,
whereas
in
fact
what
--
when
he
said
it
was
public,
which
is
really
quite
different
in
this
--
in
this
context.
and
this
--
i
say
this
chiefly
to
illustrate
how
important
the
words
used
in
describing
such
a
conversation
maybe
here.
and
why
this
is
therefore,
a
particularly
important
instance
where
access
to
the
grand
jury
minutes
would
have
been
valuable.
now
interestingly
enough,
this
same
witness
gardner
has
testified
about
this
conversation
in
a
later
proceeding
before
the
sacb,
which
we
quoted
in
our
brief
of
page
35,
and
there
he
puts
it
quite
differently.
he
says
there
that
he
was
quite
convinced,
that
is
travis,
that
neither
the
american
nor
the
canadian
authorities
believed
his
resignation
was
genuine.
and
as
a
result,
he
had
this
difficulty
in
getting
over
the
boarder.
well,
of
course
to
say
that
the
american
and
canadian
authorities
didn't
regard
his
resignation
as
genuine
is
really
not
much
news.
the
fact
that
this
prosecution
was
brought
in
the
case
that
the
government
didn't
think
his
resignation
was
genuine
and
as
you
can
see
so
forth
that
is
very
much
less
like
an
admission
than
the
way
he
put
it
in
this
trial
and
very
much
less
like
it
in
the
way
the
government
described
it
in
their
brief.
so
as
i
say,
i
brought
out
the
details
about
this
conversation,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
ever
were
circumstances
where
access
to
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
would
have
been
useful
to
compare
what
he
said
about
this
episode
there
to
what
he
said
before
the
jury.
this
is
such
an
illustration.
now,
i
think
there
can
be
no
defense
of
the
way
the
trial
court
handled
this
whole
matter
of
the
request
for
access
to
these
minutes.
to
begin
with,
although
this
court
had
made
it
clear
in
pittsburgh
plate
glass
that
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
preliminary
showing
of
inconsistency.
the
trial
judge
said
that
in
his
opinion,
even
a
possible
inconsistency
was
not
enough
that
it
had
to
be
an
inconsistency
going
to
the
basis
of
the
case.
then,
when
the
petitioner's
counsel
tried
to
particularize
further
the
possible
need
for
this
testimony
and
endeavored
to
question
the
witnesses
about
what
they
had
talked
about
before
the
grand
jury
and
whether
they
had
described
these
conversations,
the
trial
judge
cut
him
off
and
would
not
allow
that
line
of
testimony
--
of
questioning
to
be
pursued,
so
that
there
he
was
very
much
hampered
in
efforts
to
show
by
examining
the
witnesses
that
there
might
be
need
for
access
to
the
testimony.
and
then
finally,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
prosecution
simply
took
a
blanket
position
of
opposition
to
any
and
every
request
for
any
grand
jury
testimony,
no
matter
how
limited.
as
i
read
the
government's
brief,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
they
have
made
any
very
serious
effort
to
defend
these
rulings
in
this
trial.
the
main
burden
of
their
brief
on
this
point
is
that
if
it
should
be
ruled
that
there
was
an
abusive
discussion
here
and
a
reversal
on
that
ground,
they
ask
that
this
court
not
lay
down
any
absolute
rule,
any
rule
of
absolute
right
to
access
to
minutes.
well,
what
they
call,
they
don't
want
to
rule
an
automatic
disclosure.
we
have
not
asked
here
for
any
such
rule
of
automatic
disclosure.
in
our
brief,
we
have
tried
to
analyze
the
factors
that
should
come
into
play
in
handling
a
request
for
grand
jury
testimony,
what
should
be
considered
and
what
shouldn't.
and
what
the
differences
are
between
the
grand
jury
problem
and
the
3500
problem,
they
aren't
on
all
force
in
a
review.
but
far
short
of
any
rule
of
automatic
disclosure,
it
does
seem
to
us
that
in
circumstances
such
as
this
case
presents,
where
the
crucial
evidence
is
discussions
to
which
nobody
but
the
witness
and
the
defendant
were
purvey,
where
the
wording
of
these
--
of
these
descriptions
of
the
conversations
is
in
importance,
that
there
is
no
sound
reason
why
the
minutes
should
not
be
examined.
and
as
i
said
earlier,
in
the
second
circuit,
there
is
a
whole
line
of
decisions
that
would
clearly
cover
a
situation
like
this.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
practice
of
the
second
circuit
is
sound.
mr.
telford
taylor
beyond
it?
perhaps,
the
best
answer
mr.
justice
harlan
will
be
to
read
one
paragraph
from
this
last
decision,
which
is
in
the
hernandez
case
decided
in
august.
that
was
a
narcotics
case
and
the
witness
for
the
government
was
an
agent
of
the
bureau
of
narcotics.
and
described
a
conversation
with
the
defendant
in
which
the
defendant
had
referred
to
another
person
as
one
of
his
suppliers.
alright,
it's
very
much
like
this
case,
because
it's
just
such
a
conversation.
the
court
says
and
this
is
a
per
curiam
opinion,
judges
clark,
waterman
and
moore.
the
government's
case
rested
largely
upon
new
newkirk's
(ph)
testimony,
so
that
any
doubts
cast
upon
his
credibility
by
a
variance
between
such
testimony
and
that
given
before
the
grand
jury,
undoubtedly,
would
have
influenced
the
juries
liberations.
it
was
thus
incumbent
upon
the
trial
court
to
inspect
the
minutes
as
requested
by
the
defendant
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
any
material
inconsistencies
existed.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
don't
think
so.
they
have
never
said
so.
that
the
practice
as
a
matter
of
fact
now,
has
become
pretty
standard
there,
and
as
i
indicated
before
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
there
now
often
turns
over
the
minutes
voluntarily.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
lot
of
trouble
in
this
field
is
caused
by
a
sort
of
automatic
attitude.
if
the
--
if
the
government
automatically
resists
every
request
for
testimony,
you
get
these
questions
precipitated,
when
there
is
no
--
really
no
good
reason
why
the
testimony
shouldn't
have
been
looked
at.
may
i
then
turn
to
the
matter
--
to
some
of
the
other
matters
that
our
petitioner
seeks
to
review.
and
the
next
few,
i'm
going
to
speak
very
briefly
about
the
matter
of
the
perjury
rule.
that
the
rule
requiring
either
two
witnesses
or
one
witness
plus
corroboration
on
the
falseness
of
the
oath.
the
government
says
that
rule
is
not
applicable
here
because
this
is
not
technically
a
perjury
case.
now,
as
i
indicated
before,
this
question
was
up
in
the
gold
case.
it
was
briefed
then
and
although
i
didn't
hear
argument,
i
assume
it
was
a
full
argument.
and
i'll
be
frank
to
say
that
having
read
the
briefs
in
that
case,
i
do
not
think
that
we
have
been
able
to
add
very
much
to
what
was
said
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
there
and
i
don't
think
the
government
has
been
able
to
add
much
to
what
the
government
said
before.
and
for
that
reason,
i
would
refer
not
to
take
the
court's
time
to
go
over
all
these
considerations
that
must
be
pretty
familiar
by
now.
this
point
was
dissented.
this
was
a
point
of
judge
murrah's
dissent
here.
in
the
gold
case,
judge
bazelon
expressed
himself
to
the
effect
that
perjury
rule
should
apply.
it
seems
to
us
the
government's
position
is
over
technical,
that
this
is,
in
all
essential
respects,
like
a
perjury
trial,
and
that
there
is
no
good
reason
why
the
same
requirements
shouldn't
apply.
to
be
on
that,
i
would
further
rely
on
our
brief
on
what
is
said
there.
mr.
telford
taylor
not
favored.
it
is
true
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
think
it's
fair
to
that
it
is
regarded
as
such
an
exception,
yes
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
and
for
that
reason,
i
suppose
it
was
that
the
government
came
into
this
court
--
i
don't
know
just
how
long
ago,
six
or
eight
years
ago
in
the
weiler
(ph)
case
and
urged
all
these
considerations
and
said,
we
think
it's
time
you
change
your
minds,
the
rule
is
old
and
out
of
date.
let's
have
done
with
it.
it
was
argued
i
know,
by
very
able
counsel
and
the
court
said,
no,
that
we
will
adhere
to
the
rule.
so
having
--
so
completely,
i
say
that
issue
recently,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
is
not
likely
to
again
pour
the
whole
question
over
from
the
roots.
even
though
it
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
even
--
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
if
the
rule
is
accepted
as
part
of
the
paraphernalia
with
the
federal
judicial
system,
the
evidentiary
system
that
a
matter
ended
as
being
overly
technical
to
say,
it
doesn't
apply
unless
it's
technically
perjury.
that
the
reasons
conspire
here
--
mr.
telford
taylor
we
have
put
in
our
brief
--
mr.
telford
taylor
we
have
put
on
our
brief
everything
we
confined
on.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that's
quite
accurate
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
we
have
found
some
cases
there
where
it's
applied
in
proceedings
related
to
bankruptcy,
which
are
not
technically
perjury.
we
have
looked
high
and
low
for
cases
under
the
false
claims
--
false
statement
statute,
because
of
course,
that's
where
we
hope
to
find
it,
but
question
doesn't
seem
to
have
arisen.
now,
what's
actually
happened
to
a
lot
of
these
trials,
i
cannot
say.
but
the
only
cases
that
it
has
been
thoroughly
pursued
by
the
lower
courts
have
been
on
these
9
(h)
cases,
and
there's
division
of
opinion
among
the
circuit
judges
on
it.
policy
considerations
seem
to
me,
have
been
pretty
well
explored.
on
the
evidence,
once
again,
i
would
like
to
restrict
my
argument
to
one
of
the
--
of
the
evidentiary
points
here.
we
do
complain
quite
seriously
of
rulings
that
restricted
the
cross-examination,
but
i
think,
everything
is
well
covered
in
the
brief
as
i
can
hope
to
do
here.
the
thing
i
would
like
to
talk
about
appears
in
our
brief
at
page
51.
it's
this
expert
testimony
that
i
referred
to
earlier
in
my
argument.
it
was
given
by
the
witness
eckert
and
the
testimony
is
set
forth
there
at
page
51
of
our
brief,
where
eckert
is
asked
based
upon
his
experience
and
his
membership
and
so
forth.
whether
there
was
a
party
policy
on
resignation
from
the
communist
party.
he
said,
yes.
and
then
was
asked
to
state
the
policy.
the
policy
of
the
party
was
that
once
having
joined
the
communist
party,
you
could
not
leave
without
being
expelled.
now,
that
evidence
was
offered
by
the
government
and
was
used
by
the
government
before
the
jury
to
try
to
convince
them
that
since
there
was
such
a
party
policy,
that
travis'
public
statement
of
resignation
could
not
have
been
bona
fide.
it
must
have
been
phony
because
it
was
out
of
accord
with
his
party
policy.
may
i
say
in
a
preliminary
respect
that
the
douds
case,
in
which
these
provisions
were
upheld,
was
very
explicitly
based
on
the
assumption
that
you
could
avoid
the
requirement
of
this
statute
by
resigning
from
the
communist
party
and
remaining
an
officer
of
the
union.
so
that
a
rule
of
--
i
mean,
accepting
this
evidence
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
offered,
would
seem
to
make
it
pretty
impossible
to
resign
and
comply
with
what
said
in
the
douds
case.
it
would
almost
mean
that
once
in,
you
were
in
for
good
and
there
was
no
effective
way
of
getting
out
so
that
you
could
continue
your
union
membership.
the
government
does
endeavor
to
make
a
more
limited
justification
for
this
testimony
by
saying
that
it
is
relevant
to
the
petitioner's
own
state
of
mind.
that
if
it
is
a
fact
that
he
had
been
a
communist
for
several
years
and
if
it
is
a
fact
that
there
is
such
a
party
policy,
this
would
indicate
that
his
frame
of
mind
when
he
resigned
was
not
a
sincere
frame
of
mind.
that
he
was
doing
a
phony
act.
if
one
assumes
that
the
testimony
might
bear
such
an
inference,
it
nonetheless
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
you
could
not
use
the
testimony
that
way,
unless
it
were
shown
that
the
petitioner
knew
of
this
policy
and
felt
bound
by
it,
that
he
subscribed
to
it.
and
with
that
in
mind,
the
petitioner
asked
the
trial
judge
to
instruct
the
jury
that
in
weighing
this
testimony
on
the
--
this
expert
testimony
on
party
policy,
that
they
should
disregard
it
unless
they
were
satisfied
that
travis
knew
of
this
policy
and
subscribed
to
it.
the
trial
judge
refused
to
so
instruct
and
he
made
what
seems
to
me,
a
bad
matter
worse
by
then
affirmatively
instructing
the
jury
that
they
could
give
such
weight
as
they
saw
fit
to
this
expert
testimony,
without
questioning
them.
that
if
travis
didn't
know
anything
about
it
of
course,
that
it
shouldn't
be
binding
on
it,
so
that
we
complain
of
that
--
mr.
telford
taylor
i
suppose
it's
quite
possible
--
mr.
telford
taylor
it
is
possible
that
he
couldn't
have
known
about
it
and
still
not
agreed
with
it.
he
could
have
known
about
it
and
said
i'm
going
to
defy
it
and
resign.
all
these
things
are
possible
but
certainly,
if
he
didn't
know
anything
about
it
at
all,
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
policy
couldn't
be
used
as
showing
what
his
state
of
mind
about
his
resignation
was.
and
all
we
wanted
was
for
that
be
made
clear
for
the
jury.
that
unless
it
was
shown
that
travis
had
some
knowledge
of
this
supposed
policy
that
it
shouldn't
be
held
against
him.
now
furthermore,
our
other
complaint
is
that
in
fact
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
he
knew
about
this
policy.
the
trial
court
seemed
to
think
to
the
fact
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
party
was
sufficient
proof
that
he
knew
of
this
policy
but
that,
under
many
past
rulings,
is
not
a
proper
inference,
the
mere
fact
of
membership
would
not
establish
that
he
knew
of
the
particular
policy
like
this.
then
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
that
because
he
did
know
about
the
party's
policy
on
compliance
or
noncompliance
of
the
taft-hartley
law,
that
maybe
this
shows
that
he
knew
about
the
non-resignation
policy.
but
there
again,
i
don't
think
you
can
infer
a
knowledge
of
one
policy
from
the
fact
that
he
knows
another.
so
that
we
say
that
there
was
no
evidence
tying
this
suppose
policy
of
petitioner
and
that
even
if
their
had
been
some
evidence,
we
were
entitled
to
a
cautionary
instruction
here
that
--
to
straighten
the
jury
out
on
the
matter.
i
would
like
to
speak
of
one
more
thing
before
going
to
the
motions
for
a
new
trial.
we
have
here
two
problems
under
the
jencks
statute,
18
u.s.c.
3500.
there
are
two
quite
distinct
problems.
i
think
they're
both
quite
simple
and
i'm
at
a
loss
to
know
why
the
trial
court
encountered
so
much
difficulty
in
coping
with
them
that
it
did.
the
first
of
these
problems
relates
to
the
handling
of
documents
which
were
in
the
possession
of
the
prosecution.
the
prosecution
in
other
words,
had
these
fbi
reports,
conversations
with
the
--
with
the
government
witnesses,
but
there
was
question
about
some
of
them,
as
to
whether
they
were
statements
within
the
meaning
of
3500
(e),
maybe
they
weren't
sufficiently
verbatim,
maybe
they
had
some
other
effect.
in
any
event,
the
prosecution
had
these
statements
and
they
began
to
embark
on
the
policy
that
this
court
approved
in
the
palermo
case.
that
is
to
say,
if
they
had
doubt
about
particular
statements,
they
wanted
to
submit
it
to
the
trial
judge
in
camera,
so
that
he
could
determine
whether
or
not,
it
was
a
statement
with
the
unmeaning
of
3500
(e).
the
trial
judge
inexplicably,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
ruled
that
he
would
not
rule
under
3500
(e).
he
said
his
only
function
was
in
3500
(c),
that
if
the
government
brought
him
a
statement,
he'd
examine
it
to
see
if
it
contained
irrelevant
material
and
then
he
would
excise
the
irrelevant
material
under
the
3500
(c).
but
he
would
not
make
any
determinations
as
to
whether
it
was
or
was
not,
a
statement
within
the
meaning
of
3500
(e).
mr.
telford
taylor
before
palermo
came
down,
we
were
informed
to
try
to
establish
that.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
offhand.
mr.
telford
taylor
in
any
event
--
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
correct.
they
did
in
the
palermo,
did
just
that.
it
was
tried
before
that,
i'm
told,
but
the
government,
nonetheless,
is
prepared
to
go
down
this
path
and
to
submit
them
for
in
camera
examination.
the
trial
court
said,
no,
don't
do
that.
don't
bring
in
any
documents
unless
you
are
prepared
to
assume
that
they
are
statements
under
3500
(e).
then
i
will
approve
them
for
irrelevant
portions,
but
i
won't
look
at
them
to
determine
whether
they
fall
within
3500
(e).
and
having
said
that
to
the
government,
the
government
said,
alright
we'll
then
have
to
reappraise
our
position.
and
so
far
as
the
record
shows
they
thereafter
brought
in
only
those
documents
which
they
thought
were
clearly
3500
(e)
and
not
those
which
they
otherwise
would
have
brought
in
for
in
camera
inspection
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
should
be
turned
over.
now
that's
one
point
which
relates
entirely
to
documents
that
were
admittedly
in
the
prosecution's
hands.
of
course,
we
do
not
know
whether
in
fact,
they
would
have
qualified
under
3500
(e).
since
they
weren't
produce
at
all,
they
are
not
sealed
and
delivered
up
here
so
that
this
court
can't
look
at
them
either.
we
do
have
the
sealed
excisions
of
irrelevant
matter
from
the
statements
that
were
turned
over,
but
we
don't
have
the
doubtful
statements
that
might
or
might
not
have
been
produceable
under
3500
(e),
they
never
came.
our
other
point
under
3500
relates
to
the
possibility
of
there
being
other
statements
that
the
prosecution
did
not
know
about
but
could
find
out
about.
the
prosecution
witnesses
had
testified
in
other
proceedings
and
they,
under
cross-examination,
said,
yes,
before
their
testimony
and
these
other
proceedings
they
have
talked
to
government
agents,
government
attorneys.
also,
one
of
them
had
talked
to
a
senate
committee
investigator
when
he
was
down
on
some
other
proceeding.
the
request
that
the
defense
made
for
these
statements
was
broad
enough
to
comprehend
and
specifically
was
intended
to
comprehend
any
statements
that
might
have
been
made
in
the
course
of
these
interviews
with
government
attorneys,
senate
committee
investigator.
the
government
took
the
position
that
3500
does
not
cover
senate
committee
agents.
and
the
government
further
took
the
position
that
it
was
not
responsible
to
make
inquiry
to
other
government
attorneys
to
see
if
they
had
produceable
statements
under
3500.
it's
quite
clear
on
the
record
that
the
prosecuting
attorneys
said,
i'm
not
--
i
don't
know
what
other
government
attorneys
may
have.
mr.
telford
taylor
in
the
case
of
the
senate
committee
agent,
it
appears
to
have
been
on
the
idea
that
3500
doesn't
cover
committee
agents,
legislative
agents.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
but
it
has
a
more
particular
word
here
that
i
guess
would
be
the
governing
word
mr.
justice
brennan
and
that
is
agent
of
the
government,
any
statement
made
by
a
government
witness
to
an
agent
of
the
government.
more
broadly,
i
think
it
was
his
position
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
find
out
whether
the
witness
has
made
statements
to
the
fbi,
to
make
inquiry
in
washington
for
whatever
they
might
have
and
that
was
the
end
of
his
responsibility
in
the
matter.
and
he
talked
about
how
he
couldn't
be
responsible
for
what
other
government
attorneys
might
have
done
and
he
didn't
see
how
the
court
could
ask
a
senate
committee
to
turn
over
documents
and
so
forth.
so
it
seems
to
have
been
a
legal
objection
that
he
made.
as
a
result,
the
court
never
did
rule
on
this.
they
never
did
require
the
prosecution
to
find
out
whether
there
were
any
such
statements
in
the
hands
of
senate
committee
or
other
government
attorneys
and
the
prosecution
was
never
made
to
explore
the
thing.
what
we
see
--
once
again,
we
do
not
know
whether
there
may
or
may
not
be
any
such
statements.
if
they
exist,
they
might
or
might
not
be
of
the
kind
that
would
be
producible
under
paragraph
(e),
might
or
might
not
be
verbatim
or
not.
but
at
least
it
seems
to
us,
inquiry
should
have
been
made
to
find
out
and
the
government
attorney
should
not
have
taken
the
position
that
this
wasn't
his
job.
the
result
of
this
was
that
instead
of
a
simple
request
for
information
to
these
places,
defense
counsel
had
no
recourse
but
to
try
to
examine
at
length,
the
witnesses
in
camera
to
see
if
they
recalled
having
made
any
statements,
what
are
the
circumstances
or
their
talks
were,
and
so
forth,
which
wasn't
the
satisfactory
procedure
because
the
witnesses
themselves
could
not
be
sure
whether
or
--
whether
there
was
or
wasn't
any
statement
of
their
interview.
there
could
have
been
a
recording
made
that
they
knew
nothing
about.
the
government
would
know
whether
they
did
or
didn't
have
any
statement
emanating
from
those
conversations.
mr.
telford
taylor
no,
they're
not
your
honor.
they
are
not.
they
were
not
produced
in
the
camera.
they
are
not
produced
to
defense.
they
are
not
produced
at
all
and
they're
--
they're
not
part
of
the
record
or
available
here.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
correct
your
honor.
if
the
perjury
rule
governed,
then
there
should
have
been
a
charge,
and
the
charge
was
submitted
embodiment.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
right,
yes.
we
have
one
other
point
about
the
trial
which
i
wish
--
i
would've
otherwise
liked
to
talk
about,
but
i
think
i'm
going
to
pass
over
the
point
relating
to
the
instructions
on
membership.
let
me
just
state
briefly
that
the
point
of
our
complaint
is
that
in
the
charge
the
jury
on
membership,
the
indicia
of
membership
as
set
forth
in
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
were
used,
were
stated
to
the
jury
as
basis
from
which
membership
where
--
as
things
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
had
remained
a
member.
the
court
at
the
moment
has
the
sacb
case
which
was
argued
in
october,
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
those
indicia
comes
up
in
quite
a
different
context.
that
is
there
constitutionality
or
not,
in
terms
of
the
internal
security
act
of
1950.
here
you
have
the
question
whether
those
indica
can
validly
be
used
as
instructions
to
the
jury
in
a
criminal
case
involving
the
issue
with
membership.
and
we
say
that
in
the
first
place,
we
complain
about
the
fact
that
instead
of
--
if
you're
going
to
give
the
indicia
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
you
should
have
given
all
of
it,
but
you
didn't.
but
we
do
complain
about
the
indicia
themselves
on
the
ground
that
they
are
so
vague
and
so
sweeping
that
they
cannot
validly
be
used
as
the
basis
for
a
jury
determination
on
this
issue.
all
that
is
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
i
hope.
now,
i
then,
deal
with
cases
3
and
71,
the
motions
for
a
new
trial.
and
may
i
say
quite
frankly
that
no.
3
is
by
far
the
more
important
of
two,
it
is
doubtful
whether
no.
71
would
have
been
made,
except
for
its
cumulative
interests
coming
on
top
of
the
motion
in
no.
3.
the
motion
no.
3
concerns
the
same
witness
gardner,
whose
conversation
used
from
another
connection.
and
gardner
also
testified
in
a
case
in
cleveland,
in
a
federal
court
in
cleveland,
the
west
case,
which
is
a
case
involving
a
conspiracy
to
make
false
affidavits
under
taft-harley
law.
that
case
is
pending
on
petition
for
certiorari
here
at
the
moment
and
not
yet
acted
on.
and
in
that
case
in
cleveland,
gardner
was
asked
whether
he
had
had
any
military
service.
and
he
replied
with
the
flat
denial
that
he'd
been
ever
in
the
armed
forces.
the
attorneys
in
the
west
case
then
wrote
to
the
government
to
make
inquiry
and
the
result
of
their
inquiry,
you'll
--
the
court
will
find
at
page
3
of
the
record
in
no.
3.
the
department
of
justice
wrote
back
saying
that
inquiry
now
disclosed
that
the
he
had
served
in
the
armed
forces
from
1922
to
1925
and
the
course
of
which
he
was
absent
on
--
without
leave
and
he
was
court-martialed
and
confined
at
hard
labor.
he
then
reenlisted
in
1925,
i
beg
your
pardon,
in
january
1926
and
had
then
deserted
on
may
11.
and
so,
he
had
a
somewhat
lengthy
and
checked
military
history.
the
false
--
the
false
answer
on
his
ties
into
another
thing
which
is
referred
to
at
page
4
of
the
record
and
that
is
the
fbi
report
which
was
furnished
to
the
defense
now
in
this
case,
in
the
travis
case,
under
3500.
and
the
essential
facts
of
which
were
at
the
top
of
page
4
there
that
he
had
no
military
service
and
that
he'd
been
employed
by
the
dupont
chemical
company
from
1925
to
1929.
the
discrepancy
on
that
date,
a
check
revealed
that
he
went
to
work
there
in
1926,
not
1925
and
the
mistake
on
that
date
of
course,
exactly
coincides
with
the
year
1926,
when
he
in
fact
deserted
from
the
armed
forces.
now,
admittedly,
these
matters
are
not
directly
on
the
issue
of
the
trial.
they
could
be
described
as
being
collateral
in
that
sense.
and
the
government
says
that
they
provide
no
basis
for
a
new
trial
for
that
reason.
we
think
that
the
decisions
in
(inaudible)
and
other
cases
have
--
well,
they
haven't
eliminated
at
all
the
question
of
collateral
--
collateral
proof.
they
do
indicate
that
under
some
circumstances,
collateral
evidence
which
is
destructive
of
the
witness'
credibility,
maybe
the
basis
for
a
new
trial.
and
this
again,
i
think
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
kind
of
case
this
is,
where
really
the
only
direct
evidence
we
have
to
go
on
are
these
conversations
to
place
the
time
in
the
affidavits
and
gardner's
version
of
what
those
were,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
has
admitted
hostility
to
this
union
of
this
defendant
and
that
his
credibility
became
a
vitally
important
matter.
well
now,
this
is
certainly
very
damaging
to
his
credibility
and
we
think
would
have
been
a
vital
--
might
have
been
a
vital
impact
on
the
jury.
the
government
makes
one
other
argument
here
in
the
west
case
itself
when
this
test
--
this
information
was
uncovered.
they
made
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
west
case,
which
was
denied
and
the
denial
of
that
motion
is
one
of
the
grounds
for
certiorari
which
has
been
urged
here.
the
government
says,
the
west
case
has
therefore
--
the
judge
there
has
waived
this
and
found
it
insufficient
as
the
judge
did
in
our
case.
but
the
two
things
are
not
--
are
not
on
the
same
bottom
here,
because
in
the
west
case
when
they
held
--
they'd
had
their
hearing
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
it
was
brought
out
that
one
of
the
defense
attorneys
in
the
west
case
had
known
about
gardner's
military
service
at
the
time
he
testified.
therefore,
says
the
trial
judge,
it's
very
unlikely
that
gardner
testified
deliberately
falsely
because
he
knew
that
this
defense
attorney
knew
about
it.
he
probably
thought
the
question
was
directed
only
to
world
war
ii
in
which
he
didn't
serve.
and
therefore,
we
don't
think
he
deliberately
falsified.
well
that
explanation
might
have
been
all
right
in
the
west
case,
but
it
obviously
doesn't
fit
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
we
also
have
the
fbi
report.
he
certainly
wasn't
called
into
any
error
on
that
because
of
presence
of
--
the
presence
of
the
defense
attorney
and
the
fact
that
the
dates
of
employment
are
falsified
in
exactly
the
right
way
to
cover
up
the
year
of
his
desertion,
is
further
a
very
strong
evidence
that
this
was
deliberate
falsification.
so
we
say
for
all
those
reasons,
the
motion
in
no.
3
was
sufficient
grounds
for
a
new
trial,
the
motion
in
no.
71
is
based
on
other
discrepancies
in
gardner's
testimony
about
the
time
of
his
marriage
and
divorce,
which
standing
by
themselves,
wouldn't
have
supported
the
motion.
but
they
do
accentuate
the
impression
that
you
get
from
the
motion
in
no.
3
that
this
--
there's
a
man
who
was
capable
of
a
very
deliberate
and
extensive
falsification.
mr.
chief
justice
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
telford
taylor
i
thought
it
might
be
helpful
for
me
to
try
to
clear
the
matter
of
where
these
prosecutions
have
been
brought
before
as
a
matter
of
practice,
which
i
think
both
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
about.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
did
not
mean
to
say
and
i
don't
think
i
said
that
all
but
two
of
these
cases
have
been
brought
in
washington.
what
i
think,
i
said
and
meant
to
say
was
that
all
but
two
of
these
cases
have
been
brought
where
the
affidavit
was
filed,
not
where
it
was
made.
mr.
telford
taylor
now,
that
of
course
means
in
the
case
of
the
national
officers
would
be
washington,
but
in
the
case
of
the
local
officers,
it
would
be
different.
if
a
national
officer
lives
in
washington,
obviously
mailing
and
filing
are
in
the
same
district.
similarly,
if
he
lives
in
the
same
place
where
the
regional
office
is,
a
local
officer
will
have
no
venue
problem.
both
will
be
in
the
same
district,
but
the
two
examples
i
gave
were
one
from
each.
the
ben
gold
case
was
a
case
to
a
national
officer
and
was
brought
here
in
washington.
the
jencks
case,
i
averted
to,
which
was
a
local
officer
case,
but
the
west
is
wide
and
the
distances
between
the
place
of
mailing
and
the
place
of
filing
was
all
the
way
from
new
mexico
to
el
paso.
the
prosecution
was
in
el
paso,
where
the
regional
office
was
located
and
where
the
affidavit
was
filed.
the
affidavit
was
in
fact
mailed
from
new
mexico,
silver
mine
or
somewhere
like
that,
where
he
had
his
union
headquarters
just
as
here.
now,
my
statement
was
right
i
think
that
putting
all
of
these
together,
that
the
only
other
case
where
the
prosecution
has
been
brought
at
the
place
of
mailing
is
the
valenti
case
where
the
third
circuit
came
with
the
other
conclusion.
there
is
one
other
case
that
is
--
that
is
rather
more
complicated.
there
had
been
three
national
officer
cases,
this
one,
the
ben
gold
case
and
the
bryson
case.
the
bryson
case
was
marine
cooks
and
stewards
and
was
a
union
officer
--
national
union
officer
who
lived
on
the
west
coast.
he
was
first
indicted
on
the
west
coast
where
the
affidavit
was
mailed,
but
as
soon
as
he
challenged
venue
in
the
west
coast,
the
government
withdrew
the
indictment
representing
to
the
court
that
there
was
doubt
about
there
being
venue
in
california
and
therefore,
they
would
withdraw
the
indictment
in
california
and
bring
the
case
here
in
the
district,
and
they
did
that.
and
bryson
was
then
indicted
here
in
the
district
where
his
affidavit
was
filed,
he
being
a
national
officer.
bryson
then
said,
"it's
a
hardship
for
me
to
be
tried
in
washington.
please
send
the
case
back
to
california."
and
judge
morris
sitting
here
in
the
district
court
did.
so
he
was
tried
in
california
on
a
washington
indictment.
when
he
got
back
to
california
again,
the
district
court
there
said,
well,
we
don't
think
we
have
venue
and
we
don't
think
the
case
should
be
sent
back
out
here,
but
he
has
waived
his
objection
to
this
by
asking
for
it
to
come.
so
that
was
the
long
history
on
the
--
on
the
bryson
thing.
mr.
telford
taylor
that's
correct.
as
far
as
i
know,
they've
been
three
of
national
officers.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes,
because
the
local
cases,
if
you
have
a
difference
between
place
of
mailing
and
place
of
filing
present,
the
same
problem,
as
in
the
case
jencks.
mr.
telford
taylor
pardon
me.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
has
been
sells,
fisher,
hoffman,
killian,
jencks,
valenti,
i'm
sorry,
i
haven't
made
a
complete
list,
but
there
have
been
quite
a
number.
mr.
telford
taylor
it
was
different
in
valenti
and
it
was
different
in
jencks.
now,
i
would
have
to
check.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
reminded,
the
killian
case
also
which
is
now
pending
here
on
petition,
is
similar
and
that
there
he
was
tried
in
chicago,
where
filed
and
not
in
milwaukee
where
he
lived,
different
district
there
too.
perhaps,
these
others
presented
no
problem
because
the
office
may
have
been
in
the
same
district.
mr.
telford
taylor
oh,
it
isn't
a
long
sustained
practice
like
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
it
is
nonetheless,
a
fact
that
the
only
other
case
where
they
have
gone
on
the
filing
basis
is
valenti,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is
no
doubt.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is
not
doubt
that
the
defendant
may
try
to
play
between
jurisdictions
just
as
the
government
may
and
take
advantage
of
both
is
a
devise
in
counsel
did
there.
however,
the
views
of
the
california
courts
in
this
thing
were
that
there
was
no
venue
out
there
and
the
only
reason
they
would
entertain
it
when
it
came
back,
was
on
the
theory
that
he
waived
it.
mr.
telford
taylor
there
is
no
question
however
that
he
had
lack
--
that
he
had
endeavored
to
get
back
out
there,
so
that
it
--
it
does
seem
to
me
it
can
be
--
so
that
he
had
waived
it.
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
another
minute
or
two,
i
can,
i
believe,
complete
on
this
and
i
wanted
to
say
another
word
about
the
grand
jury
thing
chiefly
because
of
the
references
to
different
grand
juries
here.
for
the
most
part,
the
request
for
grand
jury
minutes
related
to
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
travis
in
this
case.
but
there
was
one
other
grand
jury
importantly
involved
and
one
other
peripherally
involved.
the
witness
gardner,
one
of
these
three,
had
not
testified
in
the
first
trial
or
before
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
travis
in
this
case.
he
had
testified
in
the
same
court
before
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
travis
and
13
others
for
conspiracy
to
file
false
affidavits.
and
so
in
the
case
of
gardner,
these
requests
ran
to
that
jury
which
was
in
the
same
court,
in
the
same
district
and
same
defendant
involved
and
not
the
one
that
indicted
him
in
this
case.
now,
we
point
--
we
discussed
this
circumstance
in
the
brief
and
point
out
that
this
might
have
been
a
reason
for
examining
the
testimony
in
camera,
to
see
if
it
related
to
matters
involved
in
the
other
case
and
not
in
this
case
and
exclude
irrelevancies.
but
there
the
court
expressly
said
that
he
was
not
denying
the
motion
for
grand
jury
minutes
because
it
was
other
juries,
that
wasn't
the
point
with
him
at
all.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he
said,
the
best
place
to
look
for
his
reason
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
your
honor,
is
and
as
to
the
your
question,
was
this
around
page
492
and
494
of
the
record,
where
you
will
see
that
he
says
in
substance
that
responses
to
request
for
grand
jury
testimony
have
rarely
been
granted.
he
seemed
to
me
to
exhibit
the
feeling
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
wasn't
the
right
thing
to
do
and
that
he
never
had
any
feeling
that
he
really
got
to
balance
the
equities
and
see
whether
it
be
a
good
or
bad
idea.
mr.
telford
taylor
never
what?
mr.
telford
taylor
oh
this
--
mr.
telford
taylor
--
this
judge
didn't
to
it
ever
either,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
telford
taylor
yes.
well,
judge
now
obviously
took
a
very
dim
view
of
the
whole
idea
of
ever
looking
at
grand
jury
minutes,
and
therefore,
i
think
his
discretion,
if
exercised
at
all,
was
restrained
by
the
notion
that
this
wasn't
really
a
sound
idea.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
