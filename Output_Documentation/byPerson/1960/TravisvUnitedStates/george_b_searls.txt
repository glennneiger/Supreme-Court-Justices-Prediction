mr.
george
b.
searls
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
because
mr.
taylor
spoke
first
on
the
venue
point,
i
shall
cover
it,
but
briefly.
if
the
petitioner
had
not
mailed
or
caused
to
be
mailed,
the
letter
in
denver
containing
these
affidavits,
they
wouldn't
have
been
filed
to
the
board
in
the
district
of
columbia.
he
acted,
we
think,
in
denver
to
produce
a
result
in
effect
in
washington.
he
started
a
force
going
that
ended
up
in
washington.
now,
the
lombardo
case
is
what
the
offense
was
the
failure
to
file.
and
while
petitioner's
scarce
at
the
distinction
--
i
think
we
can't
overlook
at
the
fact,
there
is
a
difference
between
action
and
inaction
and
between
malfeasance
and
nonfeasance.
if
you're
required
to
file
something
at
a
given
place
and
you
never
do
it,
you
don't
do
it
on
the
appointed
date,
the
courts
haven't
pushed
any
rule
to
the
point
of
saying
that
you
commit
a
failure
in
your
home.
that
was
an
argument
the
government
made
in
lombardo.
but
there
have
been
a
great
number
of
cases
in
which
false
statements
had
been
mailed
from
distant
points
to
washington
and
the
offense
has
been
held
subject
to
prosecution
in
the
district
of
the
mailing.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
it's
when
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
no,
it's
not
so
much
this
use
of
the
mail
that
he
has
put
it
out
of
his
control.
now
there
are
some
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
where
men
made
a
false
affidavit
or
a
false
statement.
in
new
jersey,
let's
say,
and
then
took
it
across
the
river,
filed
it
in
a
government
office
in
new
york.
now,
up
until
the
time
when
he
handed
that
in,
he
could've
withheld
it
or
he
could've
corrected
it.
and
the
court
held
in
those
cases
and
i
think
correctly
that
the
place
of
filing
was
the
only
possible
jurisdiction.
but
here,
neither
the
lombardo
case
nor
any
other
case
that
i
know,
says
that
false
filing
and
non-filing
are
in
the
same
category.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
your
honor
it
would
have
been
saved
by
the
hand
of
province.
mr.
george
b.
searls
actual
filing
is
evidence
of
what
your
honor?
mr.
george
b.
searls
that
--
that
is
correct.
but
he
began
the
course
of
events
in
colorado.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think
then
your
honor
there
would
be
an
offense.
mr.
george
b.
searls
if
the
notification
not
to
take
them
arrived
before
the
letter
containing
the
affidavits.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
it's
a
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
this
is
a
question
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
this
is
a
question
your
honor,
of
his
personal
control.
what
he
did,
what
the
officer
did
in
this
case
was
to
prepare
the
affidavits
or
secure,
i'd
call
it.
they
were
apparently
given
to
the
president
of
the
union,
who
mailed
them.
and
in
other
words,
a
stipulation
i
believe
that
they
were
caused
to
be
mailed
or
at
least
that
was
admitted.
i
suppose
up
to
the
time
that
the
affidavit
actually
left
the
union
officers
in
denver,
mr.
travis
would
have
had
the
right
to
recall
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
would
have
the
right
to
recall
it.
i
mean
to
say,
don't
send
in
my
affidavit.
mr.
george
b.
searls
ell
of
course,
the
fact
here
is
that
he
made
no
effort
to
get
it
back.
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
fact
here
is
he
made
no
effort
to
get
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
of
course
the
--
i
understand
there
has
been
a
practice
in
recent
years
of
post
office
whereby
you
can
get
letters
back.
we
have
to
act
very
quickly.
mr.
george
b.
searls
you
have
to
act
very
quickly.
mr.
george
b.
searls
and
i
suppose
[laughs]
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
and
i
think
it's
quite
a
complicated
procedure.
i've
never
had
to
do
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
sir.
and
now,
to
go
on
--
before
going
on
to
something
else,
i
want
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
george
b.
searls
it
wouldn't
be
filed
[laughs]
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think
they're
required
to
be
mailed,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
suppose
it's
the
agent
of
the
mailer.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
think
it's
a
case
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
he
began
the
offense.
mr.
george
b.
searls
by
causing
it
to
be
mailed.
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
offense
making
or
using
a
document
containing
a
false
statement.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
your
honor
i
think,
we
have
to
take
into
account,
we
have
two
statutes
here
leaving
out
of
--
account
from
a
--
the
continuing
offense
statute.
1529,
doesn't
require
any
affidavit
to
be
filed
anywhere.
it
says
the
board
shall
not
take
certain
proceedings
unless
an
affidavit
is
on
file
with
the
board.
then
the
section
ends
up
with
the
words,
"the
provisions
of
section
35
(a),
that's
now
1001
of
the
criminal
code,
shall
be
applicable
in
respect
to
such
affidavits."
now,
that
is
the
statute
which
i
referred
when
i
said
it
penalized
the
making
or
using
of
a
document
containing
a
false
statement.
and
i
think
when
it
seems
to
us
--
when
mr.
travis
caused
to
be
mailed
a
false
affidavit,
if
false
it
was,
that
he
was
then
putting
the
affidavit
to
the
use
for
which
it
was
designed.
there
was
no
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
his
action
--
his
action
has
ended.
i
mean,
i
have
in
mind
of
course
that
the
mails
might
be
viewed
as
his
agent
and
in
that
sense,
he
was
continuing
to
act.
but
the
--
as
far
as
travis
was
concerned,
the
thing
was
over
and
done
with,
when
the
affidavit
was
mailed.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think
that
would
be
quite
as
strong
as
the
mail
because
of
the
possibility
of
recovery
would
be
greater.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
i
--
i
think
that
is
one
element,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'll
assume
that's
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
procedure.
i
would
have
--
i
would
have
supposed
that
you
had
to
make
a
ratification
at
the
post
office
where
you
mailed
it.
but
at
any
rate,
if
he
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
there
would
be
your
honor,
since
he
had
made
no
effort
to
recall
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that's
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
agree
--
i
think
that's
a
correct
statement.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
think
you
also
have
taken
to
account
perhaps,
your
honor
that
when
we
mail
a
letter,
we
figure
that's
done.
that's
the
ordinary
reaction.
we
don't
consider
the
possibility
that
we
could
rush
around
to
the
post
office
and
get
a
stop
order
or
whatever
they
call
it.
as
far
as
we're
concerned,
the
act
is
complete.
and
i
think
that
is
the
situation
here.
now,
there's
been
some
mention
made
in
some
of
the
other
cases
under
this
statute.
well
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
think
we
could,
but
i
wouldn't
regard
it
as
a
strong
case
because
if
you
send
it
to
the
union,
while
you
--
it's
instruction,
now
you
take
this
and
mail
to
washington.
you're
making
the
union
your
agent
to
that
extent.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
your
honor,
but
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
except
in
the
case
you
put,
i'm
sure
he
would've
been
indicted
after
all
in
washington.
mr.
george
b.
searls
your
honor,
as
far
as
whether
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
whether
it's
put
in
the
mail
addressed
to
the
place
where
it
is
intended
to
be
filed.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
know
that
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
it
--
as
i
said
that
in
the
case
you
put,
an
indictment
could
be
laid
in
denver.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
first,
i
change
my
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
don't
like
the
term
continuing
crime
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
it's
begun
in
denver
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
begun
in
denver
and
completed
in
washington.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
so
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
that's
a
difference
with
the
cases
though
i
suppose
between
preparation
and
beginning.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
thinking
he
has
to
--
not
only
get
ready,
he
has
to
do
an
act.
mr.
george
b.
searls
oh,
i
think
your
honor
in
that
case,
that
would
be
the
only
case
he
could
be
tried
would
be
--
he
didn't
begin
to
commit
--
shoot
his
wife
in
philadelphia.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
as
far
as
trial
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
is
concerned
i
think
the
filing
began
or
the
beginning
of
the
filing
was
when
the
letter
was
put
in
the
post
office.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
because
your
honor
--
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
but
i
suppose
the
difference
is
this
that
until
he
relinquishes
the
affidavit
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
making
and
using.
yes,
your
honor,
but
my
impression
is
that
the
cases,
not
in
this
court,
but
i
don't
know
if
this
court
was
ever
presented
on
the
question,
have
interpreted
making
in
the
sense
of
presenting
or
something
in
sense
of
sort
of
presenting
of
making
false
testimony
in
the
sense,
you
don't
do
it
until
you
give
it.
but
i
say
that
he
made
it
and
used
it
in
denver
at
least
to
the
extent
of
beginning
of
filing
which
was
a
violation
of
1001,
not
a
violation
of
159
(h),
except
insofar
as
to
two
statutes
are
read
into
each
other.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i'm
not
sure
that
i
got
the
first
part
of
the
question,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
i
suppose
it
prospers
your
resemblance
to
the
--
some
resemblance
to
the
point
in
the
law
of
contracts,
i
understand
the
majority
rule
there
is
an
acceptance
--
effective
when
mailed.
mr.
george
b.
searls
the
mailing
was
a
necessary
part
of
the
delivery.
there's
nothing
in
either
statute
that
uses
the
word
"delivery".
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
that
point
most
of
the
prosecutions,
as
far
as
i
know,
have
concerned
--
well
that,
i
think
the
exception
of
ben
gold
case,
officers
of
local
unions,
under
the
board's
regulation,
those
unions
are
to
filed
in
a
regional
office
of
the
board
where
the
union
is
located.
and
i
think
that
is
probably
the
explanation
why
most
of
those
prosecutions
have
been
doubted
around
in
different
districts.
mr.
george
b.
searls
all
but
two
of
the
--
oh
no,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
--
i
didn't
understand
him
to
say
that.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
theres
been
a
--
perhaps,
he
was
limiting
at
the
cases
of
national
officers.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well
in
that
case
that
maybe
true.
i
don't
know,
but
i'm
saying
that
a
lot
of
the
cases
under
the
statute
are
indictments
of
local
officers
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
where
the
filing
is
not
to
be
in
washington,
but
in
the
regional
office
which
maybe
in
philadelphia
or
cleveland,
any
one
or
the
other
regional
offices.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
no.
i
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
it
doesn't
strengthen
the
position
at
all,
your
honor.
it
only
explains
why
these
cases
have
been
doubted
around
the
country.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think,
your
honor.
there
have
been
many
cases
of
indictment
of
national
officers.
the
gold
case
i
think
was
one
and
this
was
one.
the
valenti
case,
which
was
also
mentioned,
i
think,
was
the
case
of
a
local
officer
which
wouldn't
have
been
brought
here
anyway.
offhand,
i
can't
claim
to
be
familiar
with
all
these
cases.
i
do
not
know
of
any
prosecution
except
this,
the
gold
case
of
a
national
officer.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
there
--
the
two
prosecutions
of
national
officers.
mr.
george
b.
searls
one
brought
here
and
one
brought
in
denver.
mr.
george
b.
searls
of
national
officers
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well
now,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
develop
the
evidence
somewhat.
we
think
that
the
evidence
has
to
be
looked
at
as
a
whole,
to
see
the
way
the
parts
tie
in
with
one
another.
that
it
is
not
reasonable
as
the
petitioner's
brief
does
to
take
each
isolated
utterance
and
try
to
explain
it
away
in
the
terms
of
what
it
might
have
meant.
it
might
mean
one
thing.
if
there
was
no
background,
it
might
mean
quite
another
thing
against
the
certain
background.
now,
for
example,
i
would
like
to
start
with
this
talk
that
gardner
testified
to
that
he
had
with
petitioner
in
the
fall
of
1951.
now
that
was
on
the
return
from
a
trip
to
canada.
travis
came
and
i
think
john
clark,
the
president
of
the
union,
came
to
buffalo.
gardner
went
over
there
from
buffalo
and
drove
them
in
his
car
across
the
canadian
border.
then
later,
i
don't
know
where
clark
went,
travis
and
gardner
drove
back
alone.
and
it
was
then
that
the
conversation
took
place.
now
at
that
time,
gardner
was
a
member,
an
active
member,
of
the
communist
party.
and
it
was
in
that
context
that
the
conversation
occurred,
which
travis
told
gardner
that
he
started
out
by
calling
him,
"you
come
with
excellent
recommendations
from
the
communist
party
in
cleveland."
i
don't
know
why
the
communist
party
in
cleveland
would
recommend
one
of
their
members
to
a
non-member
in
another
city,
but
that
is
one
little
brick,
i
think,
in
the
structure.
then,
there
was
the
testimony
that
gardner
--
that
travis
said
that
he
realized
that
his
public
resignation
had
been
a
mistake
because
some
enemies,
he
gave
the
enemies
of
the
party,
in
outcome,
they
are
pointing
out
that
it
wasn't
real.
we
think
the
jury
could
infer
from
that
that
travis
meant
two
things.
one,
that
his
resignation
was
not
really
bona
fide;
and
two,
that
travis
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party;
he
was
talking
as
one
communist
to
another
in
the
fall
of
1951.
now,
the
jury
could
relate
that
back
to
eckert's
testimony
that
in
1948,
at
a
meeting
in
his
home
which
was
then
in
chicago.
mr.
george
b.
searls
that
was
before
the
affidavit,
your
honor.
before
the
resignation,
too.
mr.
george
b.
searls
travis
asked
a
communist
official,
green,
who
was
present
at
the
meeting,
whether
the
policy
of
lenin
to
the
effect
that
it
was
important,
all
important
for
the
communist
to
remain
in
the
trade
union
and
to
use
every
trick
or
artifice
to
accomplish
that
and
whether
that
applied
to
the
situation
and
they
were
talking
about
the
taft-hartley
affidavits.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
it's
referred
to
on
our
brief
on
pages
15
and
16,
your
honor.
and
according
to
the
testimony
at
that
conversation,
green
said,
"well,
if
you
resign,
the
officers
can
join
something
like
a
social"
and
he
meant,
union
officers,
“social
--
thursday
afternoon
social
club”,
which
wouldn't
necessarily
be
the
same
thing
as
the
communist
party.
the
jury
could
also
tie
up
both
of
those
items
or
the
other
item,
a
testimony
by
mason
in
1949
that
he
talked
with
travis
and
that
travis
told
him,
showed
him
his
resignation
statement.
this
was
before
this
--
i
mean
statement
that
was
published.
this
was
before
it
was
published,
and
said
it
has
been
cleared
with
ben
gold
and
with
the
party
people
in
new
york.
in
other
words
that
it
was
being
published
with
the
approval
of
the
communist
party.
that
also
had
some
bearing,
we
think,
on
the
fact
to
that
up
to
1948
according
to
eckert's
testimony,
the
communist
party
had
a
no
resignation
policy.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
only
think
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
it
makes
a
difference
if
we
can
show
reason
for
inferring
that
he
knew
of
it.
and
also,
your
honor,
i
point
out
that
in
1948
and
1949,
between
1948
and
1949,
the
communist
party
changed
its
policy
on
the
taft-hartley
affidavits.
mr.
george
b.
searls
yes,
but
i
mean,
they
apparently
were
compelled
under
the
pressure
of
the
act
to
modify
their
noncompliance
standard
--
stand,
which
they
took
in
1948.
and
then
by
1949,
according
to
what
mason,
i
mean,
travis
told
mason,
their
policy
was
to
have
union
officers
submit
--
file
the
affidavits.
now
that
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think,
your
honor
has
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
of
course
not
for
purposes
of
the
law
your
honor,
for
purposes
of
the
statute
like
this.
it
could,
however,
have
this
bearing
that
it
would
show
the
degree
of
attention
that
travis
paid
to
the
party
orders
and
the
party
policies.
that
he
thought
that
in
1949,
when
he
claimed
he
was
resigning,
he
had
to
get
the
agreement
of
the
party
to
it.
i
take
it
the
no
resignation
policy
didn't
exclude
the
possibility
that
the
party
might
agree
to
let
somebody
resign.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i'm
--
that
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
the
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
think
the
very
--
only
bearing
in
has
upon
is
whether
when
he
agreed
with
the
party
on
a
resignation
whether
--
well
it
has
some
slight
bearing
on
the
question
whether
it's
a
bona
fide
resignation
or
whether
the
party
had
agreed
to
it
for
purposes
of
his
own
--
of
its
own,
which
might
well
mean
that
it
was
not
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
your
honor,
but
they
could
--
i
suppose
their
only
--
you're
looking
at
it
from
the,
we're
looking
at
it
from
the
wrong
end
of
the
telescope.
i
mean,
the
party
says,
you
can't
resign
if
it
does.
that
means
that
if
you
submit
a
resignation
and
they
don't
accept
it,
they're
going
to
consider
--
consider
you
a
member
but
that
doesn't
--
going
to
mean
you're
going
to
be
a
member
for
purposes
of
a
false
affidavit
under
the
taft-hartley
act
or
for
other
legal
purposes.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
your
honor.
i
would
--
i
would
say,
it
does
not
mean
he
is
a
member
at
all.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think,
even
if
he
knew
it
whether
have
much
significance,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
there's
evidence
that
the
party
policy
in
other
respects,
i'm
speaking
of
the
taft-hartley
affidavits,
they
changed
very
significantly
between
1948
and
whenever
they
did
change
it
in
1949
and
it
would
seem
to
me
logical
that
at
that
time
they
would
also,
if
they
had
had
a
no
resignation
policy,
make
a
change
in
that
too,
because
whether
a
resignation
of
a
union
officer
was
going
to
be
bona
fide
or
not
from
the
party
point
of
view,
they'd
have
to
modify
this
so-called
policy,
if
they
were
going
to
agree
to
it.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
it
was
--
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
it
was
contemplated
that
by
resigning,
he
could
file,
providing
it
was
the
real
and
bona
fide
resignation.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
instructions
of
the
court
that
the
jury
could
have
reached
that
conclusion,
because
they
were
very
plainly
instructed
that
membership,
in
the
sense
on
which
it
was
relevant
to
the
indictment,
was
a
matter
of
mutual
consent.
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
i
can
give
the
same
answer
i
gave
mr.
justice
black.
he
would
not
be
a
member
although
the
communist
party
would
--
might
consider
him
one.
they
might
carry
him
on
their
role
still
as
a
member,
but
he
would
not
be
member
if
he
resigned
in
good
faith,
and
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
well,
that's
right.
mr.
george
b.
searls
but
i
don't
think,
under
the
instruction
of
the
court
that
evidence
prejudice
--
had
any
real
chance
of
prejudice
in
the
defendant.
now,
i
like
to
go
to
one
more
thing
and
that
is,
the
jury
could
also
take
into
account,
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
--
of
the
petitioner
before
1949
and
during
the
period
1952
and
1953,
in
which
--
during
which
times,
he
was
acting
as
an
active
member
of
the
party
and
as
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
party
in
the
union.
now,
in
march
1952,
he
had
a
conversation
with
mason,
i
think,
in
which
about
some
proposal
which
the
communist
in
russia
had
made
or
the
russian
delegation
to
some
convention
in
europe,
that
a
third
federation
of
labor
be
set
up
in
the
united
states.
the
term
was
used
the
expelled
unions
by
which
i
take
it
to
mean,
the
unions
like
mine
mill,
which
ultimately
was
cast
out
of
the
cio,
and
i
gathered
there
were
probably
some
others.
travis
was
the
man
selected
apparently
by
the
party
to
pass
--
discuss
that
matter
with
the
members
or
the
leaders
of
the
union
and
to
report
back
to
the
french
communist
who
was
delegated
to
receive
the
news.
then
in
1953,
travis
was
apparently
important
and
active
in
both
the
party
and
the
union,
because
according
to
mason's
testimony,
travis
had
to
say
as
to
what
went
on
the
agenda
at
the
annual
staff
conference
of
the
union.
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
travis
made
the
statement
in
regard
to
apply
to
something
mason
said
that
"when
they
get
us
communist,
they
will
be
after
people
like
you."
later
in
1953,
gardner
who
was
still
a
member
of
the
party
was
transferred
by
mine
mill
from
cleveland
to
idaho.
he
was
instructed
on
his
way
west
to
stopover
at
denver
to
be
briefed
by
travis.
and
travis
told
him
that
there
was
a
serious
factional
dispute
in
the
party
going
on
in
the
district
in
idaho
to
which
he
was
going.
and
until
that
dispute
was
resolved,
he
was
to
refrain
from
any
active
party
activities
in
the
district
to
which
he
was
going.
now,
that
suggest
that
at
that
time,
travis
was
not
only
a
member
of
the
party,
but
was
at
a
position
of
authority
in
it
so
that
the
man
who
didn't
--
who
was
an
employee
of
a
union,
could
be
instructed
to
stop
over
and
see
him
and
get
his
instructions
from
him.
now,
then
in
1953
later,
mason
complained
to
travis
about
the
tactics
of
travis
and
what
mason
called,
his
party
watchdogs,
in
regard
to
a
--
some
collective
bargaining
that
was
going
on
in
montana.
and
he
said
that
he
spoke
to
--
he
told
travis
that,
"i
am
speaking
to
you
as
the
leader
of
the
party
in
the
union."
again,
later
on
they
had
another
conference
and
mason
says
that
he
discussed
with
travis,
travis'
party
activities,
as
leader
of
the
party
forces,
meaning
in
the
union.
and
that
during
that
discussion,
travis
said
"well
you
and
joe,
mason's
brother,
had
your
chance,
you
were
invited
to
join
the
party.
had
you
done
so,
you
would
be
sitting
high
in
the
council
of
this
organization
with
us."
now,
we
submit
that
on
that
evidence,
taking
it
all
together,
the
jury
could
find,
there
was
a
continuous
course
of
party
activity
of
such
a
nature
as
to
justify
the
inference
that
travis,
in
the
one
narrow
period,
which
hasn't
been
covered
by
evidence,
1950
and
the
part
of
1951,
that
travis
was
a
member
throughout
there.
he
only
claimed
he
resigned
in
1949.
he
never
made
any
claim
that
he
resigned
at
any
other
date.
and
we
think
that
the
evidence
brackets
the
affidavit
dates,
december
1951
and
december
1952,
so
that
the
jury
could
properly
find
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
party
on
the
date
when
he
signed.
your
honor,
i
urge
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
should
like
to
leave
to
our
brief
the
argument
on
what
is
claimed
to
be
errors
in
the
admission
or
exclusion
of
evidence.
mr.
taylor
paid
very
brief
attention
to
it.
and
i
think
our
position
is
adequately
set
out
there
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
and
i
want
to
come
to
another
factor
of
the
case
which
i
regard
as
more
important
matters,
the
question
of
the
production
of
the
grand
jury
members.
our
position
is
that
whether
it's
for
purposes
of
production
direct
to
the
defense
or
for
purposes
of
in
camera
inspection,
the
trial
court
has
discretion
in
handling
a
motion
for
either
or
both
of
those
forms
of
relief.
and
i
think
to
judge
whether
the
trial
court
here
abused
its
discretion,
we
have
to
read
the
record
carefully
because
well
i
would
almost
say,
there
are
as
many
pages
of
argument
and
colloquy
in
chambers
on
this
subject
and
related
subjects
as
there
are
of
testimony
in
court
in
the
record.
it
was
explored
extensively
and
you
can't
rest
on
any
one
statement,
either
by
the
trial
court
or
by
a
counsel
for
the
defense
or
by
the
united
states
attorney.
position
shifted
a
little
bit
as
the
trial
went
on.
now,
we
say
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
and
we
have
several
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
plaintiff's
motions
for
production,
except
in
possibly
one
or
possibly
two
instances,
were
too
broad.
plaintiff's
briefs,
despite
speaks
in
terms
of
a
request
for
the
minutes
of
the
grand
jury
testimony,
which
is
the
way
in
which
one
would
speak
or
write
of
a
request
for
the
minutes
of
the
jury
which
returned
the
indictment,
which
is
on
trial.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
your
honor.
what
he
started
off
by
saying
was
he
wanted
transcript
with
respect
to
eckert,
of
his
testimony
before
any
grand
juries
and
he
named
a
number
of
cases
in
which
eckert
had
testified
and
he
wanted
transcript
before
any
of
those
juries,
only
two
of
which
were
in
the
district
of
colorado.
that
ties
up
with
what
your
honor
just
said
about
these
grand
juries,
that's
on
page
424
of
the
record.
mr.
george
b.
searls
at
that
time,
i
think
counsel
had
not
modified
his
previous
motion.
so
he
was
still
asking
for
the
testimony
of
all
the
grand
juries
before
which,
it
could
be
found
out,
that
eckert
had
testified.
now,
later
on,
he
did
modify
his
request.
he
came
down,
this
is
on
page
425
of
the
record,
to
a
request
for
the
transcript
of
eckert's
testimony
before
three
grand
juries.
before
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
travis
in
1954,
before
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
travis
and
13
other
people
for
another
--
and
another
--
for
another
offense
in
1956,
and
for
the
travis'
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
in
the
gold
case
which
was
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
as
to
mason,
the
motion
was
for
any
grand
jury
testimony
this
witness
has
given
and
is
--
i
am
not
entirely
sure,
but
i
think,
it
was
at
that
time
that
counsel
for
the
defendant
said,
the
united
states
attorney
has
told
me
he's
testified
before
a
number
of
them.
i
think
that
was
in
connection
with
mason.
now
as
to
gardner,
there
was
also
originally,
a
motion
for
a
test
--
production
of
testimony
before
any
grand
juries.
there's
also
one
time
where
the
counsel
attempted
to
question
gardner
about
his
testimony
or
whether
he
had
testified
in
the
1956
grand
jury
hearing
as
to
each
of
the
19
--
of
the
14
defendants,
named
in
the
1956
indictment.
he
finally
came
down,
however,
as
with
respect
to
gardner
to
a
request
to
examine
his
1956
grand
jury
testimony
as
to
two
episodes
of
canadian
trip,
which
i
have
mentioned
and
the
talk
with
travis
in
denver
when
gardner
was
on
his
way
to
idaho.
now,
the
court
--
there's
been
some
discussion
argument
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
the
court
sustained
improperly
questions
as
to
examination
before
grand
jury.
i
think
in
a
great
many
instances
that
was
sustained,
where
it
was
a
testimony
before
another
grand
jury
than
the
one
which
returned
this
indictment
in
1954.
i
might
also
point
out
that
it
is
clear
that
what
the
defense
was
looking
for
was
not
the
ordinary
case
of
the
--
as
i
advised,
we
expect
of
moving
to
see
the
grand
jury
minutes
in
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
the
defendant.
but
in
most
of
his
request,
were
addressed
to
all,
as
many
as
grand
juries
as
he
could
think
of.
now,
i
think
that
all
the
instances
cited
in
plaintiff's
brief
on
page
32,
of
--
objections
being
sustained
to
questions
asked
witnesses
as
to
testifying
before
grand
jury.
i
think,
all
the
items
listed
on
in
that
refer
to
the
1956
grand
jury,
which
had
indicted
travis
for
another
crime
and
indicted
13
other
defendants.
now
that
case,
at
that
time,
was
still
pending,
according
to
a
statement
in
the
record
here,
in
the
district
court
of
colorado
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
it
hasn't
apparently
even
reached
the
trial
stage.
now,
i
understand
that
it
is
implicit
in
this
court's
decision
in
palermo
possibly,
in
some
other
decisions
that
to
get
grand
jury
minutes
or
even
perhaps
to
have
the
judge
look
at
them
in
camera,
the
defendant
has
to
show
a
need.
now,
perhaps
the
reason
defendant's
counsel
was
asked
more
questions,
that
it
seems
to
me,
about
the
1956
grand
jury
and
about
the
1954
grand
jury
was
that
he
has
in
his
hands
transcripts
of
the
testimony
of
eckert
and
mason
at
the
first
trial
of
the
petitioner
which
took
place
in
1955
and
which
--
of
which
he
may
have
very
little
use
in
any
attempt
to
show
inconsistencies.
now,
as
to
eckert,
he
had
also
transcripts
of
some
six
other
proceedings
or
hearings
in
which
eckert
had
testified.
they're
listed
in
the
brief.
and
as
to
mason
he
had
an
addition
to
the
1955
transcript,
transcript
of
his
testimony
in
an
nlrb
hearing.
now,
we
usually
need
something
that
we
don't
have.
and
in
this
case,
he
did
have
transcripts
of
the
testimony
at
the
first
trial
of
eckert
and
mason.
gardner
did
not
testify
at
the
first
trial
or
in
the
1954
grand
jury.
and
the
only
inconsistencies
that
he
showed
were
of
this
nature.
he'd
asked
eckert,
“you
testified
in
the
gold
case
in
the
district
of
columbia,
did
you
not?”
“yes.”
“did
you
tell
about
this
1948
meeting
where
the
communist
policy
on
not
signing
taft-hartley
affidavits
was
set?”
“in
your
transcript
--
in
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
--
your
testimony
in
the
gold
case,
you
did
not
mention
that
james
durkin
was
at
that
meeting,
did
you?”
“no,
i
didn't.”
“why
didn't
you?”
“well,
i
just
didn't
happen
to
think
of
him
at
that
time.”
now,
he
--
there
are
a
large
number
of
such
so-called
inconsistencies;
none
of
them,
however,
relate
to
travis.
there
was
no
pointing
out
that
did
he
had
ever
testified
in
any
other
hearing
or
proceeding
that
travis
was
not
at
a
meeting
to
which
he
was
--
he
testified
in
this
trial.
there
was
no
testimony
that
he
ever
omitted
travis'
name.
most
of
these
meetings
were
of
a
sizable
number
of
people
and
in
a
number
of
cases,
eckert
said
something
like
there
were
a
large
number
of
people
there
and
a
number
of
people
that,
then
he
listed
name
and
that's
all
i
can
remember.
in
no
instance
i
think,
was
he
--
where
the
cross-examiner
able
to
show
that
he
had
--
eckert
had
previously
said
that
durkin,
for
example,
was
not
at
a
particular
meeting
when
he
--
and
said
later
on
that
he
was.
it
was
just
a
matter
of
omission
or
is
not
of
a
matter
of
contradiction.
as
i
have
just
been
pointing
out
full
cross-examination
of
the
plaintiff's
--
of
the
plaintiff's
witnesses.
the
defense
had
a
large
amount
of
material
even
without
any
grand
jury
minutes.
now,
there
was
--
mr.
taylor
made
a
remark
about
the
trial
court
said
that
you
have
to
show
some
rather
definite
--
i'm
quoting,
"certain
likelihood
of
material
contradiction
to
get
the
grand
jury
minutes."
and
that
that
is
not
in
accordance
of
what
this
court
said
in
palermo.
he
did
not
mention,
however,
that
at
the
trial,
the
defense
counsel
said,
"i
agree
with
the
court."
also,
defense
counsel
suggested
that
the
burden
on
the
court
of
examining
all
these
minutes
would
be
too
great.
and
we
think
that
the
district
judge
was
not
unreasonable
in
refusing
to
examine
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses
in
maybe
six
or
eight
other
grand
jury
hearings.
when
the
defense
had
a
large
number
of
transcripts
available
to
it
and
when
there
was
no
showing
of
real
need,
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
discretion
and
the
trial
court
had
a
difficult
time
with
all
of
motions
that
were
filed.
as
the
case
in
the
second
circuit,
as
we
read
and
they
do
not
hold,
there
is
no
discretion.
i
mean
in
--
even
while
they're
going
to
look
at
it
or
not.
in
the
zborowski
case,
the
court
examined
the
record
and
the
evidence
in
detail.
they
discovered
reasons
why
the
trial
court
should
have
examined
the
record
and
it
found
them.
in
the
mckeever
(ph)
case,
it
said
there
had
to
be
some
reason
for
supposing
that
there
is
inconsistency
between
the
trial
testimony
and
the
grand
jury
testimony.
in
fact,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
what
the
second
circuit
rule
is
because
i
think
you
will
find
that
the
trial
judge,
who
was
reversing
the
hernandez
case
to
which
mr.
taylor
referred,
was
the
circuit
judge
who
wrote
the
opinions
in
the
zborowski
and
mckeever
case,
so
that
apparently,
the
rule
is
not
too
clear
even
there.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
would
say
it
was
the
first
your
honor,
but
i
can't
refer
you
to
page
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
in
fact
i
think
that
falls
from
the
opportunities
that
were
given
to
counsel
to
cross-examine
about
--
in
whether
they
--
whether
the
witness
had
testified
for
a
grand
jury
or
not.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
think
he
could,
your
honor
and
i
think
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
sir.
mr.
george
b.
searls
no,
i
think
he
took
into
account
all
these
factors
that
i've
mentioned,
your
honor.
of
course,
when
we
got
there
and
must
remember
that
there
are
three
minutes
--
i
mean,
three
witnesses
in
three
different
sets
of
grand
jury
minutes
that
were
being
called
for,
and
what
i
have
said
my
not
necessarily
come
out
with
the
same
corroboration
in
each
instance.
now,
a
related
part
of
the
argument
is
that
whether
the
trial
judge
committed
error
in
its
rulings
on
section
3500
of
title
18.
now,
i
say
that's
related,
because
you
will
find
through
the
record
that
the
cross-examination
of
witnesses
on
whether
they
had
testified
before
grand
juries
or
not,
it's
intermixed
with
the
examination
of
witnesses
as
to
whether
they
had
given
statements
to
agents
of
the
government.
there's
one
instance
--
i
think
it's
page
6
--
i
think
it's
referred
to
in
the
defendant's
brief
in
one
--
no,
if
i
may
--
may
go
back
for
a
minute
to
the
grand
jury,
defendant's
brief,
i
think,
cites
the
record
of
686,
687
for
the
authority
that
the
trial
judge
improperly
sustained
objections
to
examination
of
witnesses
about
grand
jury
testimony.
if
you
turn
over
to
the
next
page,
on
page
688,
you
find
the
witness
was
permitted
to
be
asked
and
answered
a
question
as
to
whether
he
testified
before
the
1954
grand
jury
or
the
1958
--
1956
grand
jury.
now
on
3500,
there
has
been
some
criticism
of
the
trial
court
on
the
ground
that
by
telling
the
government
that
he
was
going
to
take
whatever
they
turned
over
as
being
admitted
to
be
a
statement.
that
he
discouraged
the
government
possibly
from
producing
at
least
for
examination,
other
documents
that
they
might
have
produced.
well,
its
urge
for
production
in
all
instances
wherein
the
language
of
the
statute,
they
say,
"you
produce
documents
required
--
statements
comes
in
3500."
and
the
remark
about
you're
having
admitted
to
these
statements,
was
when
the
united
states
attorney
after
having
submitted
a
large
number
of
documents
in
chambers
one
day
later,
was
trying
to
back
out
of
it
and
say,
"i
think
we
have
given
you
some
things
that
aren't
really
statements
within
the
statute."
and
apparently
they
have,
but
the
trial
judge
said,
"no,
you've
handed
them
over
and
i
haven't
looked
at
them,
the
next
item,
and
i'm
not
going
back
over
that
again."
now,
furthermore,
the
trial
judge
permitted
extensive
cross-examination
of
witnesses
as
to
whether
you
had
given
--
whether
they
had
given
statements,
whether
notes
were
taken,
whether
transcripts
were
made
to
various
government
attorneys,
to
the
nlrb,
to
the
mccarran
committee
and
the
court
denied
the
motions
for
additional
production,
not
because
he
thought
that,
although
he
may
have,
that
a
senate
committee
couldn't
be
forced
to
hand
over
any
statement.
or
not
because,
he
thought
the
attorney
for
the
government
in
say
the
jencks
case
in
texas
couldn't
be
forced
to
hand
over
a
statement,
but
he
denied
the
motion
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
just
felt
they
are
not
made
out
a
factual
case
of
any
additional
statements
having
been
made.
and
the
united
states
attorney
stated
categorically
on
more
than
one
occasion
and
he
produced
everything
he
had
and
everything
he
knew
about
it.
mr.
taylor
did
not
mention
in
his
argument
the
court
portion
of
the
argument
in
the
brief
on
the
use
of
uncorroborated
admissions.
i'd
like
to
add
to
what
we've
said
in
the
brief,
this
case
i
reread
recently,
the
case
of
bram
against
the
united
states
in
168
u.s.
a
decision
by
i
think
was
then
justice
white.
in
which
he
goes
into
the
reasons
for
the
rule,
and
he
pointed
out
that
bram,
at
that
time
of
the
statement
which
he
gave
was
--
which
was
used
against
him,
was
in
a
position
where
he
was
naturally
anxious,
he
was
naturally
afraid.
he
was
anxious
to
win
favor.
he
was
then
in
a
position
where
he
might
think
to
own
up
would
be
a
material
help
to
him.
as
justice
fuller
put
in
one
place,
he
was
not
a
free
agent.
now
in
these
cases,
all
these
statements
that
witnesses
testified
to
that
gardner
made,
gardner
was
certainly
--
i
mean,
travis
made.
travis
was
certainly
a
free
agent.
he
was
an
official
in
the
union.
he
was
travelling
around.
he
was
giving
orders.
he
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
of
these
people
to
whom
he
was
talking.
he
wasn't
trying
to
curry
favor
with
them.
we
think
that
just
as
was
the
--
to
it
in
this
rule,
so-called
perjury
rule,
that
the
trial
court
ruled
correctly
in
this
case.
now,
i
would
like
to
take
up
very
briefly
the
motions
for
a
new
trial,
there
were
two.
neither
was
based
--
both
related
to
gardner,
neither
was
based
on
anything
gardner
said
in
the
travis
case.
both
relating
to
matters
he
had
said
in
the
west
trial
which
is
going
on
in
cleveland,
normal
simultaneously
with
the
travis
trial
in
denver.
defendant's
reply
brief
makes
a
some
--
the
false
testimony
which
it
supposed
to
have
given
in
denver,
consisted
in
the
main
of
two
statements.
one,
he
was
asked
on
cross-examination,
“you
were
never
in
the
armed
forces
were
you?”
and
he
said,
“no,
sir.”
and
the
cross-examiner
dropped
it
and
went
on
to
another
subject.
it
is
true
as
it
turned
out
later
on
after
both
trials
that
gardner
had
been
unknown
to
anybody
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
or
in
the
department
that
was
working
on
either
of
these
cases.
he
had
been
in
the
army
for
a
period
between
1922
and
1926
and
had
deserted
in
1926.
now,
in
the
west
case,
the
trial
judge
held
a
three
and
a
half
day
hearing.
gardner
went
back
on
the
stand,
various
attorneys
testified,
fbi
agents
testified.
and
the
trial
judge
wrote
a
somewhat
lengthy
opinion
which
is
in
170
federal
supplement,
in
which
he
found
first
gardner
had
not
committed
perjury.
in
second
place,
that
he
thought
that
the
question
about
his
military
service
on
the
stand,
related
to
world
war
ii
and
that
he
had
reason
to
think
so.
and
he
concluded
that
gardner
had
not
been
convicted
on
--
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
had
not
been
convicted
on
false
testimony.
now,
the
petitioner
brings
up
the
fact
that
in
an
fbi
report
in
1955
after
gardner
had,
i
think,
been
expelled
from
the
communist
party,
the
occurrence
is
this,
this
is
a
sort
of
biographical
statement.
it's
not
written
by
gardner,
it's
into
sort
of
tabular
form.
it's
on
file
in
this
court
in
the
cases
brought
by
west
and
haupt
which
are,
i
think,
no.
93
and
--
no.
73
and
no.
74
miscellaneous.
this
term,
as
to
--
it
says,
under
military
service,
there's
the
word,
"none."
now
we
don't
know
what
questions
the
agent
asked
gardner.
we
don't
know
what
answers
gardner
gave.
this
is
a
report.
mr.
george
b.
searls
fbi
report
sir
--
mr.
george
b.
searls
--
of
an
investigation.
mr.
george
b.
searls
i
gather,
this
was
the
initial
report
on
gardner
and
i
suppose
when
they
contact
the
witness
for
the
first
time,
they
got
a
good
deal
of
biographical
data.
it's
in
--
begins
at
page
1270
of
the
second
volume
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
haupt
case
which
is
i
think
on
file
in
this
case.
furthermore,
not
only
did
the
defendant
have
this
--
that
report,
a
copy
of
that
report
at
the
trial
of
this
case,
but
a
copy
was
also
put
in
at
the
hearing
on
a
motion
for
new
trial
in
the
west
case.
and
when
the
judge
found
that
gardner
had
not
testified
falsely,
he
took
into
consideration
that
he
must
have
taken
into
consideration
the
fbi
report
as
well
as
the
other
evidence.
now,
the
second
matter
is
that
gardner
told
different
stories
about
his
marital
history.
what
turns
out
at
the
different
stories
--
the
differences
were
related
to
two
things,
one,
the
date
of
his
divorce
from
his
first
wife;
and
second,
the
date
of
his
marriage
to
the
second
wife.
now,
he
wasn't
asked
to
produce
any
copy
of
a
decree.
in
fact,
i
think
he
testified
in
the
west
case,
he
wasn't
sure
he
had
one,
although
he
was
sure
he'd
been
divorced.
and
while
there's
a
statement
in
the
record
--
this
is
in
no.
3,
the
record
in
no.
3
by
a
united
states
attorney
somewhere,
there
was
a
decree
in
1946.
i
don't
think
--
it
doesn't
appear
what
kind
of
a
decree
it
was
or
whether
it
was
a
final
decree
or
an
interrogatory
decree
or
what.
now,
the
other
thing
that
gardner
is
supposed
to
have
misrepresented
is
the
date
of
his
second
marriage.w
ell,
that
was
a
common
law
marriage?
i
don't
know
of
what
the
effective
date
of
a
common
law
marriage.
gardner
didn't
know.
he
and
his
wife
talked
it
over
and
finally
came
up
with
the
notion,
they'd
been
married
in
november
1945,
but
i
don't
suppose
the
man
really
knows
to
this
day
whether
he
was
actually
married
on
that
date
or
not,
unless
his
engaged
expert
opinion.
it
also
seems
to
us
that
both
these
things
are
so
inconsequential.
so,
not
--
i'm
not
putting
it
on
grounds
so
much
that
they're
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
the
case,
but
even
--
that
the
jury
even
if
it
had
known
of
them,
even
if
they'd
been
brought
out
at
the
trial,
it
wouldn't
have
taken
any
different
result.
are
we
going
to
disbelieve
a
man
because
he
deserted
from
the
army
in
1926,
disbelieve
him
on
the
stand
in
1958?
are
we
going
to
disbelieve
him
because
he
hasn't
been
able
to
get
straight
dates
of
his
marital
history
under
the
circumstances
i
have
described?
i
don't
think
that
it
would
affect
the
jury
one
way
or
another.
and
certainly,
the
trial
judge
who
--
decided
at
the
trial,
was
in
a
better
to
judge
than
i
am
here.
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
us
that
that
kind
of
evidence
could
make
the
showing
that
is
necessary
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
i
might
also
point
out
that
during
the
trial,
counsel
had
in
his
possession
a
transcript,
a
daily
transcript
of
gardner's
testimony
in
the
west
case
in
which
some
of
these
inconsistencies
as
to
his
marital
history
appear,
but
he
didn't
knew
that.
it
was
not
--
it
also
appears
that
counsel
had,
at
that
time,
a
copy
of
the
fbi
report
i've
mentioned,
because
it's
referred
to
in
the
record
in
no.
3
as
defendant's
exhibit
j
for
identification.
so
i
take
it
that
it
was
not
introduced
in
evidence,
but
it
was
present.
that
is
all
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions.
