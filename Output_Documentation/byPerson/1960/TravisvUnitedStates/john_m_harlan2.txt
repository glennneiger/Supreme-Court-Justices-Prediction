john
m.
harlan
is
it
up
there
before?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
9
(h),
mr.
taylor,
ever
had
its
own
criminal
provision?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
the
lombardo
case
specifically
made
that
filing
a
criminal
act,
did
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
a
false
filing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
is
it
quite
--
is
it
quite
accurate
to
say
that
the
gist
of
this
offense
is
the
filing?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
the
second
circuit
decision
would
not
go
beyond
the
situation
that
this
goes
to
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
that
would
have
automatically
(inaudible)
automatically
comply
an
exam
to
this
new
witness
irrespective
of
(inaudible)
declare.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
he
had
sworn
to
the
statement
in
colorado
and
then
instead
of
putting
it
in
the
mail,
he
has
gotten
on
a
train
and
delivered
it
in
person
in
washington,
could
you
have
indicted
him
in
colorado?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
the
use
of
the
mail
that
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
it
equally
begun
when
he
swears
to
the
statement
in
colorado?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
is
it
not
equally
begun,
in
your
theory,
when
he
swears
to
the
statement
in
colorado?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
statute
covers
both
making
and
using?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
from
what
you
said
that
you
agree
with
the
general
taylor
that
this
evidence
was
pf
no
significance,
unless
the
knowledge
of
this
policy
--
this
alleged
policy
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
brought
home
to
the
defendant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
that
this
evidence
