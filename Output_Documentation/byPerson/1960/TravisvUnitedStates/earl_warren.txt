maurice

travis,
petitioner
versus
united
states.
general
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we've
arrived
at
recess
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
searls.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
mr.
searls
you
--
we
take
the
situation
that
general
taylor
spoke
of.
he
says
that
all
his
affidavits
were
given
by
various
officers
living
in
different
parts
of
the
country
and
they
were
assembled
at
denver.
then
they
were
put
in
the
mail
and
before
they
reached
washington,
the
union
said,
we
would
--
we
don't
want
those
filed.
we
want
them
returned
to
us
and
we're
not
going
to
ask
for
a
certification.
what
--
what
would
be
the
situation
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
would
be
any
filing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
say
to
them
that
this
is
irreparably
beyond
his
control
when
he
puts
it
in
the
--
in
the
mail.
there
is
--
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
beyond
his
control
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
until
it
is
actually
filed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
those
cases,
could
i
give
you
one
more
hypothetical
and
this
is
a
case
where
--
where
it
does
get
to
washington.
but
suppose
this
petitioner
instead
of
living
in
denver,
colorado
lived
in
washington,
dc
and
he
sent
his
affidavit
back
to
denver
and
it
was
sent
from
denver
by
the
union
to
washington
where
it
was
filed,
would
you
prosecute
him
back
in
denver?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
it
be
doing
that
whether
he
lived
in
denver
or
whether
he
lived
in
washington,
dc?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
what's
the
difference
between
the
two
cases
from
a
standpoint
of
venue
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
were
you
saying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
you
say,
you're
sure
he
would,
but
i
say,
could
you
indict
him,
don't
we
have
to
know
whether
a
man
under
those
circumstances,
could
be
indicted,
as
this
man
was,
at
the
place
where
--
where
it
was
deposited
in
the
mail?
i
thought
it
was
your
theory
that
when
he
put
it
in
the
mail,
the
crime
--
there
was
a
beginning
of
the
crime
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
it
--
why
wouldn't
it
be
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
whether
it
would
be
there
just
--
it
would
be
done,
just
in
exactly
the
same
situation
in
either
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
except
one
fellow
lived
in
denver
and
the
other
one
lived
in
washington,
dc.
how
do
you
differentiate
those
two
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
it
could?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see.
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
--
i
understood
general
taylor
to
say
that
all
except
two
of
these
prosecutions
had
been
commenced
here
in
washington.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
may
have
misunderstood
it
in
my
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
but
this
and
one
more,
i
understood
him
to
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
does
that
strengthen
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
--
in
most
or
once
--
if
the
national
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
as
i
understood
was
not
complaining
because
they
were
doubted
around
the
country
as
you
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
--
he
said
that
those
--
the
national
officers
that
were
prosecuted
under
this
act
with
the
exception
of
this
in
one
other
case,
were
all
prosecuted
here
in
washington.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
before
the
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
when
congress
passed
that
law
requiring
those
affidavits
to
be
filed
that
--
did
it
contemplate
that
no
man
who
had
ever
been
a
communist
could
file
such
an
affidavit
or
did
it
contemplate
that
by
resigning,
he
could
--
he
could
file
the
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
i
see,
if
the
jury
believed
that
he
could
not,
under
any
circumstances
resign,
then
it
wouldn't
--
it
would
believe
that
he
had
no
right,
having
once
been
a
congress
--
a
communist
to
do
so,
you
think?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
if
the
communist
party
would
not
let
him
get
away,
then
how
could
it
be
a
mutual
consent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
then
whether,
whether
they
have
this
policy
or
not
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it
makes
no
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
say
this
minute,
instead
of
these
minutes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
searls.
general
taylor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
misunderstood
you,
that's
all.
