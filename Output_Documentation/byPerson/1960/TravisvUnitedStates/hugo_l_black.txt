justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say,
any
federal
statute
which
would've
been
violated
had
this
man
simply
filed
--
made
this
affidavit,
swore
to
it,
kept
it
in
denver.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say,
it
could
be
binding
on
him
if
he
doesn't
want
it
to
be,
even
if
he
knew
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
because
of
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
mean
then?
couldn't
he
have
done
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i'd
--
i
saw
it
and
i
have
acted
on
the
assumption
a
number
of
times
that
i
could
go
to
the
post
office
to
get
my
letter
back,
that
i
didn't
want
it
to
be
delivered.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i
--
i
thought
you
said
it
was
beyond
recall
and
i
thought
that
was
rather
--
for
whatever
it
was,
it
may
not
be
what
you
think
here,
but
i
thought
it
was
quite
customary
for
some
people
to
mail
a
letter
and
then
find
out
that
didn't
want
them
to
go
or
mail
something
else,
then
go
down
and
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that
[laughs].
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
take
it
--
i
wouldn't
suppose
that
would
be
possible
to
get
it
back
to
the
post
office
as
they've
delivered
it
to
somebody.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
was
getting
ready
to
file
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
your
argument
is
that
if
a
man
gets
ready
to
commit
a
crime
in
colorado,
then
it's
committed
here,
that's
a
continuing
crime
and
that
you
can
try
it
at
either
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
whatever
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
get
ready
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
read
this
morning
about
a
decision
of
the
district
where
a
man
got
ready
up
in
philadelphia
and
bought
himself
a
gun,
got
on
the
train
and
came
denver
here
and
killed
his
wife.
it's
cited
down
here.
do
you
think
that
that
was
a
right
place
for
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
got
ready
to
commit
the
crime,
before
he
came
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
--
you
said
a
while
ago
in
an
answer
to
my
question
that
this
man
get
ready
to
commit
the
crime
up
there
then
filing
which
is
a
crime.
and
therefore
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
man
did
an
act,
he
bought
himself
a
pistol
up
in
philadelphia,
for
the
expressed
purpose
of
shooting
his
wife,
it's
according
to
the
paper.
at
least
i've
seen
so
is
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
well,
he
--
he
didn't
begin
it.
this
man
didn't
begin
to
file
this
there.
he
gave
it
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
wrote
it
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
mr.
searls?
if
you
have
it
before
you,
can
you
give
me
this?
if
you
haven't,
that's
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
difference
does
that
make
so
far
as
he
was
concerned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
could
resign
if
he
wants
to,
couldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
a
different
thing,
what
happened
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
don't
understand
is
the
expert
testimony
in
that
connection
or
the
purpose
of
expert
testimony
to
show
that
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
a
policy
that
members
couldn't
resign.
it
couldn't
bind
them,
could
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
didn't
have
to
agree,
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
you
are
saying,
as
you
have
the
evidence
that
there
was
some
kind
of
a
policy
under
which
this
man
agreed
with
them
and
showed
some
way
that
he
agreed
with
them
that
he
wouldn't
resign,
when
he
did,
although
it
was
a
fake.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
prove
that
by
the
fact
that
the
party
had
a
policy
that
didn't
want
its
members
to
resign?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
the
relevance
he
lived
and
would
pretend
to
show
them,
but
i
don't
understand
that
producing
of
an
expert
to
show
that
the
confidant
--
the
party
didn't
let
its
members
--
didn't
want
its
members
to
resign
and
said
they
couldn't
â€“
it
couldn't
keep
them
permanent
if
they
wanted
to,
could
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
mean
you'll
be
member
at
all,
does
it,
if
you
resign,
without
regard
to
what
we
--
