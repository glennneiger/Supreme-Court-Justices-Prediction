justice

just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
mr.
taylor,
is
it
customary
in
cases
in
which
--
for
appellate
procedure
of
second
circuit
to
break
up
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
every
new
case?
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
tenth
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
all
went
up
together?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
day
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
act
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
you
consider
the
policy
of
the
sixth
amendment,
the
tenderness
towards
the
defendant
and
the
benefit
to
him
has
not
been
led
to
cause
to
compliment,
i
--
i
put
to
you
that
the
johnson
case,
in
expounding
the
policy
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
a
basis
of
construing
the
situation
like
this
one
whereas
congress
didn't
make
clear
or
is
not
inconsiderably
influenced
by
those
merciful
considerations
on
behalf
of
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
two
are
not
inconsistent,
mr.
taylor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
two
--
the
two
considerations
are
not
inconsistent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
have
been
a
single
--
i
mean
house
against
finkle
was
the
conspiracy
in
great
other
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
wasn't
concerned
with
the
abstract
problems
of
locating
the
offense.
it
was
concerned
with
protection
of
a
defendant
or
the
accused.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
possibly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
it
--
that
it
isn't
rationally
arguable
that
the
offense
even
in
part
was
committed
in
more
than
one
locus,
there's
no
problem.
the
problem
arises
because
typically
here,
as
here
in
the
johnson
case,
you
had
an
initiation.
i'm
not
--
not
talking
about
technical
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
had
a
stretch
of
events.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
living
as
such
where
that
--
the
residence
of
the
defendant
as
such
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
evidence
as
such
but
the
relation
of
some
share
in
the
outward
event
which
constitutes,
which
has
some
part
in
the
ultimate
crime,
some
part.
i
mean,
if
it
isn't
filed
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
reached
in
the
district
columbia
then
certainly,
speaking
as
a
matter
of
phenomenon,
a
natural
phenomenon
that
something
takes
place
outside
of
the
district.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
get
us
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest,
you
cannot
escape
that
in
a
number
of
offenses.
you
cannot
escape
that
in
conspiracy
charges.
you
cannot
escape
it
in
violations
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
there,
i
suggest
that
--
i
quite
agree
with
you,
the
government
likes
to
pick
the
--
and
sometimes
not
so
to
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
very
desirable
reason,
picketing
one
venue
rather
another.
there
are
always
the
additional
considerations
or
namely,
that
there
is
a
discretionary
problem
on
the
trial
judge
where
the
defendant
operates
to
serve
as
the
defendant
was
so
involved
to
transport
to
another
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
remember
that
mr.
justice
homes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
said
it
in
the
conspiracy
cases.
it
would
be
--
he
thought
it
was
so
unfair.
in
other
words,
he
fastened
on
fairness
or
unfairness
of
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
look
at
your
brief
or
the
governments
either,
so
you'll
make
it
beyond
to
the
government's
brief,
but
i
was
wanting
to
attach
great
weight
to
what
happens,
that
prior
in
these
cases
leading
to
crucial
evidence,
what
i
like
to
know
from
you
is
what
the
face
of
the
two-witness
rules
as
to
perjury
has
been
in
non-perjury
false
statement
cases
throughout
the
state
and
other
jurisdictions.
as
the
rule
of
man
from
earth,
i
am
speaking
from
old
memory
and
i
may
be
older,
the
rule
was
not
--
was
not
favored
throughout,
as
the
general
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
not
as
an
exception
to
the
generality
of
principle
to
affect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
need
to
imply
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
starting
point
is
right,
it
hasn't
been
applied
except
distinctively
in
perjury
cases
that
it
technically
confines
or
confined
to
--
if
you
want
to
put
an
appropriate
through
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
it
has
been
confined
to
technical
perjury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
have
--
and
probably
you've
stated
it,
i
missed
it
if
you
had.
the
applicability
of
the
perjury
rules
that
assuming
the
perjury
rule
governs,
is
there
a
defect
in
the
charge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
assumption
that
the
perjury
rule
didn't
govern?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
get
it
back
if
it's
delivered
at
the
other
end,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
the
affidavit
--
if
the
affidavit
doesn't
reach
its
destination,
there
is
no
offense.
and
therefore,
it's
idle
to
call
as
to
where
this
prosecution
should
be
brought,
there's
no
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
affidavit
is
filed,
then
the
problem
arises
whether
the
fact
that
it
had
--
i'm
not
now
speaking
legally,
but
i'm
speaking
physically.
something
that
had
a
beginning
or
--
and
an
end
in
the
outlived
world,
wether
that
comes
within
the
statute
which
allows
prosecution
to
be
brought
at
either
place.
all
the
--
all
the
hypothetical
cases
where
the
stuff
hasn't
arrived,
doesn't
get
you
anywhere
because
there's
no
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
not
--
you
can't
of
any
case
that
were
litigated,
but
are
you
saying
there
were
no
prosecutions
brought
at
all
in
the
district
or
anywhere
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
weren't
brought,
not
that
the
question
was
litigate
at
the
national
office.
you
say
that's
the
total
record
of
prosecutions
begun.
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
other
one
presents
a
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
trial
judge,
in
this
case,
did
he
profess
the
exercise
of
his
question
or
did
he
find
there
is
no
basis
calling
upon
--
called
upon
him
to
exercise
the
discretion,
which
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
he
exercised
the
discretion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
he
exercised
his
discretion
without
looking
at
the
grand
jury
minute,
did
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
in
fact
he
--
he
didn't
look
at
it.
he
didn't
say,
let
me
have
the
minute
now
and
take
a
look
at
him
and
see
if
there's
any
basis
for
the
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
of
counsel
and
the
testimony
to
which
he
had
listed
you
say,
he
found
no
papers
for
calling
for
the
minute.
what
was
that
on
the
ground
that
no
basis
for
contradiction
has
been
laid
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
it's
the
lock
that
we
have
on
the
--
had
only
three
indictments
of
national
officers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
it
could
have
been
drawn
any
kind
of
inference
or
practice
so
far
as
that
is
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
of
those
have
there
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
of
those
there
have
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
a
case
where
for
(inaudible)
a
lengthy
period
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
well
that
might
be
as
was
the
suggestion
that
i
made
to
you
as
an
old
prosecutor
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
indictment
presented
to
a
more
convenient
place
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
waiver
and
stopple
of
an
easy
resort
to
lack
of
analysis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
he
didn't
do
--
what
judge
learned
hand
as
you
well
know,
did
until
he
retired,
never
allow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
never
allowed
inspection
of
the
grand
jury.
during
your
days
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
--
but
he
didn't
profess
the
--
judge
hand
made
no
boast
about
it,
as
you
well
know.
