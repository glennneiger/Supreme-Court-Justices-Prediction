mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
before
embarking
appointed
discussion
of
the
case
in
its
merits,
i
should
like
to
correct
a
misstatement
or
an
ambiguity
appearing
in

in
discussing
the
case
of
ziang
sung
wan
versus
united
states,
it
might
appear
that
we
argue
that
later
cases
require
a
fifth
amendment
to
be
made
applicable
to
state
prosecutions.
counsels
are
aware
that
such
is
not
the
rule.
we
are
aware
of
twining
versus
new
jersey
and
adamson
versus
california.
we
can
only
apologize
and
explain
that
this
error
resulted
when
as
a
--
the
matter
--
as
a
result
of
the
matter
and
the
haste
of
which
the
response
was
necessarily
prepared,
the
argument
was
not
fully
developed.
what
should
have
been
further
stated
is
that
without
claiming
that
the
fifth
amendment
operates
to
restrict
the
state
of
california,
we
do
maintain
that
all
of
the
factors
in
this
case
must
be
considered
in
their
totality
to
determine
whether
or
not,
this
petitioner
has
been
deprived
of
his
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
the
mere
absence
or
presence
of
threats
or
promises
standing
alone
is
not
determinative
of
the
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
coerced.
the
voluntariness
of
that
confession
is
the
crux
of
this
case,
in
determining
which
all
relevant
factors
are
to
be
examined.
there
is
a
personal
experience
in
stature
of
the
defendant.
there
is
trickery
and
connivance
in
securing
his
tape
recorded
confession.
there
is
secrecy
as
well.
the
defendant's
repeated
request
for
counsel
having
been
denied.
all
of
these
are
methods,
which
history
tells
us,
were
involved
during
the
inquisition,
when
the
inquisitors
demanded
as
the
state
would
appear
to
demand
for
the
police
in
this
case,
he
completely
freehand.
these
techniques
have
survived
in
authoritarian
countries
today
where
setting
neighbor,
to
spy
upon
neighbor
is
not
uncommon.
and
just
so,
as
will
be
demonstrated,
did
the
state
set
mr.
travers
to
engage
in
conduct
which
is
a
kin
to
spying.
we
know
from
chambers
versus
florida
and
countless
other
cases
that
lawless
means,
irrespective
of
their
ends,
are
not
necessary
to
uphold
the
laws
and
are
forbidden
by
the
constitution.
such
practices
likewise
are
inimitable
to
the
accusatorial
system,
which
many
cases,
including
watts
versus
indiana
and
as
recently
as
rogers
versus
richmond,
have
declared
to
be
the
law
of
the
land
under
our
constitution.
jack
atchley
is
not
really
the
primary
concern
in
this
case.
men
have
been
executed
before
him
on
their
own
confession
for
homicide.
doubt
was
more
of
a
follow.
but
the
vital
consideration
is
the
constitution
and
whether
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
these
confessions
have
been
honestly
secured.
if
this
requirement
is
satisfied,
no
state
conviction
will
be
challenged,
for
no
one
condones
murder
and
were
all
agreed
that
one
who
takes
a
life
may
not
go
free.
but
very
naturally
is
to
be
executed
in
the
name
of
justice
and
justice,
as
it
has
delineated
for
the
states
by
the
due
process
clause,
is
not
satisfied,
if
he
be
executed
upon
his
own
confession,
say
that
confession
be
honestly,
freely,
openly
and
voluntarily
secured.
as
this
court
knows,
the
criterion
has
been
stated
in
countless
ways.
one
being
that
a
confession
must
be
the
product
of
a
defendant's
freewill.
freewill
is
a
concept
troublesome,
i
think,
to
philosophers
as
well
as
to
jurists.
and
it's
probably
alludes
in
all
embracing
definition,
but
neither
philosophically
nor
legally,
it
is
submitted
can
it
be
said
that
a
man
is
exercising
his
freewill,
making
a
free
choice,
either
to
confess
or
to
deny
when,
because
he
has
duked
and
deceived,
he
is
not
aware
that
he
is
confessing.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
certainly,
mr.
justice
harlan.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
prior
to
arraignment.
however,
i
would
like
to
confer
with
counsel
who
tried
the
case.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
it
was
prior
to
the
arraignment,
your
honor.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
we
maintain
that
this
confession
was
not
freely
self-determined,
which
is
the
phrase
as
the
court
knows
that
--
it
is
used
in
it
--
most
recent
confession
case.
this
was
not
so
much
a
confession
elicited
against
the
freewill
of
the
defendant
as
one
extracted,
absent
his
will.
briefly,
to
review
for
the
court
with
its
permission
to
salient
facts,
atchley
had
been
arrested
in
the
night,
detained
and
questioned.
he
had
consistently
denied
in
conflicting
stories
that
must
be
admitted,
commission
of
the
crime.
he
had
several
times
asked
for
an
attorney
that
these
pleas
had
gone
unheeded.
then
he
sent
for
his
--
his
friendly
insurance
agent,
mr.
travers.
they
talked.
upon
leaving,
travers
was
stopped
by
the
undersheriff
and
asked
whether
or
not
he
would
again
interview
atchley
and
would
permit
the
second
conversation
to
be
recorded.
he
readily
agreed.
atchley
had
no
knowledge
of
this.
travers
did
not
advise
him
of
the
inducing
--
inducing
course
of
the
second
conversation,
that
is
to
say
the
request
of
the
undersheriff.
travers
did
not
mention
that
a
recording
was
being
made.
he
did
not
cautioned
atchley
that
anything
he
said
might
be
used
against
him.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
your
honor,
that
cannot
be
certainly
stated.
all
that
appears
in
the
record
is
that
mr.
travers'
testimony
was
that
the
two
conversations
were
substantially
the
same,
they
had
to
come
mixed
in
his
mind.
there
is
no
--
as
i
--
as
i
have
see
--
have
read
the
record.
there
was
no
testimony
from
mr.
travers
as
to
the
complete
question
and
answer
of
the
earlier
conversation.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
this
is
in
essence,
true,
but
we
maintain
that
--
that
doesn't
really
reach
the
constitutional
issues.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
that
is
correct.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
he
had
made
several
statements
conflicting,
but
none
of
them
which
were
really
incriminatory.
he
had
attempted
to
explain
his
whereabouts,
the
time
of
the
crime
and
the
commission
of
the
crime.
but
up
until
this
time,
if
memory
serves,
as
this
court
is
aware,
i
did
not
try
did
case
and
i'm
relying
on
a
rather
poor
memory.
he
had
actually
denied
commission
of
the
crime.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
there
were
three
or
four
previous
interrogations.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
in
some
of
those,
he
denied
being
present
at
the
scene,
but
in
some,
he
admitted
being
there.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
yes.
in
relation
to
the
time
when
he
was
there,
the
time
he
was
on
the
premises
where
the
homicide
occurred
and
his
--
his
activities
in
going
a
little
shed
in
the
back
of
the
house
and
coming
in
around
the
corner
as
his
wife,
the
decedent,
arrived
home.
at
one
time,
he
gave
a
different
story
also
as
to
who
had
the
possession
of
the
gun
and
keep
claiming
on
one
occasion,
that
she
was
the
one
who
came
armed.
we
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
travers,
who
conducted
this
tape
recorded
interrogation,
was
astute,
trained
and
cunning
and
that
atchley
was
not
his
peer
in
experience
with
law
enforcement
and
investigational
methods.
although
they
are
strong
words,
advisedly
we
will
say
that
here
is
a
conspiracy
--
a
confession
coerced
by
conspiracy.
a
conspiracy
to
which
the
state
was
a
party
and
all
the
more
and
wholly
because
the
california
constitution
commands
just
as
does
the
fifth
amendment,
that
in
a
criminal
case
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
the
purpose
of
this
conspiracy
seems
clear
from
the
record.
it
would
be
exceedingly
naive
to
think
that
the
undersheriff
suggested
a
recorded
conversation
of
any
concern
for
the
interest
of
the
suspect,
atchley.
and
is
a
fair
inference
that
travers
too,
intended
to
secure
a
confession
which
would
in
turn
secure
a
conviction.
as
will
be
later
more
fully
developed,
he
presented
himself
to
atchley
as
a
friend
and
not
as
the
agent
of
the
law
which
he
had
in
fact
become.
now
it
may
be
that
his
original
agreement
to
re-see
and
re-interview
atchley,
standing
alone,
would
not
be
overwhelming
evidence
as
such
an
intent,
but
when
we
look
to
the
manner
of
his
questioning,
whether
it
was
consciously
employed
or
from
the
habit
of
his
prior
conduct
of
such
investigations
as
a
deputy
sheriff
in
nevada.
it
leaves
little
room
for
doubt
that
he
became
an
active
agent
in
furthering
the
determination
of
the
deputy
to
secure
a
conviction.
the
questioning
teams
with
leading
questions
and
travers
was
very
careful
to
omit
no
relevant
fact
concerning
a
homicide.
justice
stein
versus
new
york
tells
us
that
violence
is
inherently
coercive
and
of
no
social
value
in
solving
crime,
so
it
is
with
methods
shown
here.
treachery
and
deceit
they
submitted
are
just
as
employed
to
society.
as
the
methods
employed
in
rochin
versus
california
of
innocence
of
justice,
so
do
these
techniques.
in
all
of
the
situations,
the
state
has
so-conducted
its
criminal
prosecution
as
to
offend
the
sets
of
justice
and
in
the
end,
to
deny
defendant
a
fair
hearing
in
substance.
the
defendant
is
as
much
wronged
as
where
--
as
much
wronged
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
where
further
testimony
has
knowingly
been
used
to
convict.
the
question
would
raised
by
(inaudible).
in
the
one
instance,
the
state
has
lent
--
in
both
instances,
the
state
has
lent
itself
to
deliberate
deception,
in
the
one
case,
a
deception
of
the
court
and
the
jury,
in
the
other
case,
a
deception
of
a
defendant.
in
neither
instance
is
justice
done.
there
are
impositions
upon
the
individual
other
than
violence
which
shock
the
sensibility
and
offend
the
conscience.
and
the
unfairness
of
the
state
here
acting
as
of
course
it
must
through
its
agents,
it
is
submitted,
is
just
such
an
imposition.
we
feel
that
this
case
much
resembles
leyra
v.
denno
in
crucial
errors
--
areas,
even
though
we
will
of
course
concede
that
in
leyra,
the
defendant's
fatigued
much
more
clearly
appeared
and
that
his
illness
was
an
additional
fact.
as
the
court
will
recall,
that
was
the
case
where
a
state-employed
psychiatrist
by
subtle
and
suggestive
methods,
continued
the
efforts
of
the
police
to
induce
the
defendant
who
was
without
counsel
to
admit
his
guilt.
the
cases
differ
in
four
particulars,
but
the
distinctions
if
they
have
any
effect,
would
seem
to
make
the
confession
here
all
the
more
vulnerable.
first
in
leyra,
the
new
york
court
had
recognized
that
the
confession
had
been
coerced
and
by
promises
of
leniency
and
it
was
excluded
from
the
jury's
consideration,
the
question
coming
to
this
court
being
with
regard
to
a
subsequent
confession.
here,
the
confession
was
placed
in
evidence.
the
tape
was
played
to
the
jury
who
were
thus
exposed
to
the
impact
of
the
defendant's
own
voice.
as
with
omar's
moving
finger,
which
having
rich
moved
on,
not
all
such
piety
or
wit
has
very
naturally
might
have
had,
could
ever
have
wiped
out
a
lion
from
the
minds
of
the
jury.
and
then
they
submitted
that
from
reading
--
a
reading
of
the
record
is
rather
clearly
and
pathetically
appears
that
atchley
had
neither.
the
second
distinction
is
that
in
leyra,
it
was
the
psychiatrist
who
--
to
--
elicited
the
confession.
here,
it
was
the
defendant's
own
insurance
agent,
a
former
deputy
sheriff.
just
as
the
doctor
uses
psychiatric
training
in
bringing
out
the
confession,
so
did
travers
make
use
of
his
former
training
and
experience
in
law
enforcement.
moreover,
it
was
the
police
who
introduced
the
psychiatrist
to
leyra.
atchley
himself
had
telephoned
for
travers
and
he
had
no
possible
way
of
knowing
that
travers
was
acting
at
the
instigation
of
the
police
when
he
was
questioning
him.
whether
leyra
was
or
should
have
been
suspicious
and
on
his
guard
is
beside
the
point.
atchley
had
not
the
slightest
ground
even
to
suspect
that
travers
had
any
connection
with
the
state.
he
regarded
him
as
his
friend,
there
at
his
request
and
presumably,
to
help
him.
third,
the
record
shows
or
rather
in
leyra,
the
psychiatrist
was
on
a
state's
payroll.
here,
for
all
the
record
shows,
travers
received
nothing
for
his
connivance
with
the
officials.
to
mention
the
difference
is
to
destroy
it
for
certainly,
due
process
does
not
hang
by
so
fine
a
thread.
finally,
in
leyra,
it
appears
that
threats
and
promises
of
the
sort
were
made.
however,
it
does
not
so
clearly
appear
that
coercion
--
the
coercion
which
was
found
to
exist,
depended
upon
this
fact
alone.
as
we
read
the
case,
it
was
because
the
facts
were
irreconcilable
with
the
defendant's
mental
freedom
to
confess
or
to
deny
that
rendered
the
confession
obnoxious
to
due
process.
and
it
is
submitted
very
naturally,
had
no
more
mental
freedom
than
did
camilo
leyra.
in
spano
versus
new
york,
the
undeviating
intent
of
the
police
to
secure
from
the
defendant
a
statement
which
would
convict
him
was
manifested
by
sympathy
falsely
aroused.
there
spano,
after
his
arrest,
had
employed
an
attorney
who
counseled
him
to
answer
to
questions.
spano
followed
this
advice
until
officer
bruno,
a
friend
of
his,
importuned
him
into
confessing
via
false
stories
to
bruno's
being
in
trouble.
but
spano
knew
that
his
friend
bruno
was
a
police
officer
and
he
knew
too
that
he
was
making
a
confession
of
crime.
atchley
had
no
such
knowledge.
there
is
one
parallel
between
the
cases.
spano's
confession
was
secured
after
he
had
unsuccessfully
tried
to
see
his
attorney.
the
situation
does
not
differ
here
or
atchley
had
unsuccessfully
sought
to
contact
an
attorney.
the
ruling
in
spano
as
the
court
knows,
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
confession
obtained
following
indictment
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
must
by
--
for
that
reason
be
excluded.
for
it
was
found
the
use
of
the
confession
was
inconsistent
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
so
the
fact
that
spano
may
have
been
indicted,
whereas
here,
atchley
had
not
been
arraigned
is
of
no
moment.
there
also
appears
a
strong
factual
similarity
to
the
case
of
malinski
versus
new
york.
there,
the
claim
of
physical
violence
was
rejected
and
it
was
also
found
the
record
contained
no
persistent,
incessant
or
grueling
question.
but
malinski
was
held
in
incommunicado
and
he
was
denied
the
right
to
see
an
attorney
although
he
requested
one.
and
he
was
permitted
to
see
no
friends
with
one
exception,
the
friend
to
whom
he
made
confession.
our
position
is
of
course
that
just
as
malinski's
confession
was
a
fruit
of
coercion,
so
as
these
petitioners.
we
would
distinguish
lyons
versus
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
would
say
that
he
had
--
the
idea
that
would
be
given
a
limited
currency
perhaps.
he
thought
and
travers
several
times
told
him,
it
was
for
the
purposes
of
being
transmitted
to
the
insurance
company.
his
main
purpose
in
--
in
having
this
discussion
with
travers
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
was
this
matter
of
insurance.
now,
atchley
was
not
the
beneficiary,
but
he
was
attempting
to
arrange
the
insurance
claims
to
the
one
man
who
would
handle
these
things
for
him.
now,
it
cannot
be
denied
that
he
knew
that
this
was
to
go
to
the
insurance
company.
that
we
say
that
it
is
the
--
the
lack
of
caution,
a
cautionary
warning
of
some
sort
by
travers
stands
on
a
far
different
basis
then
would
be
the
fact,
if
this
were
one
of
the
undersheriffs
or
the
district
attorney,
deputy
as
to
whom
travers
or
atchley
had
been
discussing
the
matter.
in
that
case,
he
would
--
i
think
almost
be
presumed
to
know
that
anything
he
said
would
be
used
in
subsequent
court
proceedings.
here,
i
think
it
--
it's
a
very
fair
inference
that
he
had
no
knowledge,
that
his
conversation
with
travers
would
be
used
as
it
was.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
believe
the
record
does
show
that
the
first
conversation
as
to
which
there
is
--
i
pointed
out
and
was
no
direct
evidence.
at
that
time,
atchley
volunteered
the
information.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
this
is
true.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
don't
believe
that
he
specifically
said
that.
however,
i
think
that
by
doing
so,
it's
an
additional
act
of
deceit
upon
his
part,
because
he
knew
that
he
was
back
there
the
second
time.
at
the
instance
of
the
authorities,
he
knew
the
conversation
was
being
recorded
and
instead
of
--
he
gave
no
hint
of
any
of
this
to
atchley.
instead
he
repeated.i
think
it
appears
three
or
four
times
in
the
taped
conversation,
“i
have
to
get
all
of
these
for
the
insurance
company.
come
now,
give
me
all
the
facts.”
in
essence
is
what
he
told
him.
we
maintained
that
he
actually
drew
the
defendant's
thoughts
away
from
the
fact
the
he
might
be
incriminating
himself
and
direct
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
yet,
to
a
degree,
yet
it
incriminates
the
--
i
think
rather
clearly
appears
as
to
the
element
of
lying
in
wait
and
his
being
upon
the
premises
there.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
relying
again
on
my
recollection,
because
i
certainly
do
not
want
to
mislead
the
court.
i
believe
that
it
was.
i
believe
in
the
element
of
time
particularly.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
taking
it
by
bits
and
pieces
perhaps,
yet
here,
if
the
court
please,
he
still
was
resisting,
confessing
or
incriminating
himself
completely,
in
this
conversation,
which
you
have
just
read
mr.
chief
justice.
where
there
he
says
that
the
wife
had
the
gun
in
her
hand,
in
short
that
--
now
let's
see
--
i
wanted
to
make
sure
i'm
correct
in
this
argument.
apparently,
from
what
i
--
i
have
not
checked
the
record
in
these
two
moments,
but
apparently
from
all
that
appears
in
the
states
brief,
his
testimony
or
his
statement
then
was
that
it
was
his
wife
who
had
the
gun.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
yes.
then
in
his
--
his
conversations,
his
tape-recorded
conversation
with
mr.
travers,
mr.
travers
brought
out
the
fact
that
he,
jack,
the
--
the
defendant
--
the
petitioner
here,
was
the
one
who
had
the
gun
and
that
he
had
--
he
had
it
with
him
all
that
evening
in
the
occasion
of
his
two
trips
to
his
wife's
property.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
that
was
the
essence
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
--
that
was
the
essence
of
his
statement
to
travers
and
it
was
the
essence
of
the
defense.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
we
would
distinguish
lyons
versus
oklahoma
where
there,
the
improper
methods
had
been
used
to
extract
a
confession.
but
the
confession
was
not
used
at
the
trial.
such
might
have
been
the
case
in
this
instance,
if,
instead
of
being
bent
upon
getting
this
tape-recorded
conversation,
the
prosecution
had
merely
presented
the
--
travers'
own
testimony
as
to
his
morning
conversation
with
atchley.
but
they
were
not
intent
to
do
so.
intent
on
securing
a
confession,
the
police
used
travers,
as
we
have
shown,
the
secure
one.
the
prosecution
adopted
the
fruits
of
the
police
zealousness
and
introduced
the
confession,
the
defendant's
own
voice
and
words
at
the
trial.
now,
we
acknowledge
that
modern
scientific
devices
and
inventions
are
valuable
tools
and
maybe
the
instruments
are
further
in
justice.
but
nevertheless,
where
there
is
an
impropriety
in
their
use
by
the
same
token,
the
damage
to
the
defendant
is
magnified.
reference
has
already
been
made
to
the
fact
that
travers
did
not
caution
atchley
in
any
way
as
to
the
use
which
could
or
probably
would
be
made
of
a
statement
that
he
was
giving.
and
we
wish
to
disclaim
any
intent
here
to
argue
with
the
rule,
his
or
should
be
as
regarding
--
as
with
regard
cautionary
instructions
from
my
police
officer.
i
think
as
already
indicated,
we
can
assume
that
atchley
knew
that
he
did
not
have
to
answer
police
questions.
and
probably
that
if
he
did,
it
would
--
they
would
kidding
answers
would
be
used
against
him.
i
would
say
that
the
fact
the
he
had
given
these
conflicting
and
contradictory
stories
to
all
of
the
officers
who
had
questioned
him,
up
to
the
time
that
travers
entered
the
picture
would
indicate
he
might've
had
such
knowledge.
but
travers
was
nothing
about
officer
of
the
law.
he
wore
no
indicia
of
office.
he
was
and
so
far
as
he
was
acting
for
the
undersheriff,
he
was
to
jack
atchley
in
disguise.
he
was
one
with
whom
actually
who
had
had
business
deals.
atchley
had
telephoned
and
asked
him
to
come
to
the
jail.
travers
was
the
one
person
he
was
permitted
to
see
during
this
time
on
whom
he
could
rely.
just
as
in
the
spano
case,
bruno's
was
the
one
face
visible
in
which
he
could
put
some
trust,
so
was
travers
to
atchley.
he
had
requested
a
lawyer
and
no
doubt
would
have
relied
on
a
lawyer,
but
no
lawyer
was
permitted.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
that
is
correct.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
that
was
not
controverted.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
don't
recall
his
testimony
on
that
point.
he
did
state
in
his
conversation
with
mr.
travers
that
he
had
been
attempting
to
see
one
particular
attorney.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
that
is
correct.
however,
i
--
i
believe
his
testimony
at
the
trial
was
broader
than
that.
i
think
his
words
were
that
he
asked
everyone
he
saw
for
an
attorney.
eight
or
ten
times
he
asked
to
--
to
get
an
attorney.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
oh
yes
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
--
unquestionably
had.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
do
not
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
do
not
believe
that
that
appears
in
the
record.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
insofar
as
it
appears
from
the
tape
recording,
he
did
not.
however,
he
did
have
travers
as
was
noted
to
our
response,
to
make
arrangements
for
the
care
of
the
children.
we
feel
that
the
authorities
in
this
case
took
advantage
of
travers'
friendship
with
atchley
and
have
atchley's
reliance
upon
him.
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit,
travers
was
just
what
he
seemed
to
be,
but
when
he
returned,
he
seemed
to
be
something
that
he
was
not.
and
here
in
the
case,
quartz
company
with
ashdown
versus
utah,
where
the
defendant
knew
that
the
district
attorney
held
that
office,
where
he
cautioned
her
she
did
not
have
to
answer
any
questions
and
where
he
also
told
her
she
was
entitled
to
the
services
of
an
attorney.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
the
evidence
on
that
point
is
rather
meekly.
mr.
travers'
testimony
was
that
as
he
was
terminating
the
first
conversation,
the
undersheriff
stopped
him
and
he
told
him
that
they've
had
this
conversation.
it
doesn't
show
actually
whether
or
not
he
related
the
substance.
he
testified
that
atchley
had
told
him
all
about
it.
we
believe
that
this
can
be
--
that
this
case
can
be
distinguished
from
the
crooker
case,
where
the
defendant
had
a
college
education
and
a
law
school
training
and
knew
of
his
right
to
remain
silent.
now,
we've
already
disposed
of
this
matter
of
knowledge
of
the
right
not
to
answer
questions.
well,
atchley
had
only
a
3rd
grade
education
here.
had
and
has.
it
also
appears
from
a
reading
of
crooker
that
the
acclaim
of
denial
of
due
process
or
coercion
there
was
based
almost
on
--
did
not
almost
entirely
upon
the
denial
of
request
for
counsel.
but
here,
we
are
relying
on
additional
factors.
atchley's
limited
education,
the
repeated
questioning,
his
lack
of
sleep
and
the
fraud
practiced
upon
him
by
travers.
well,
this
court
found
that
crooker
had
not
been
imposed
--
had
not
been
taken
advantage
of,
they
submitted
that
very
face
of
this
record
shows
that
atchley
was
the
most
grievously
taken
advantage
of.
in
other
standard
which
has
been
suggested
by
some
of
the
cases
for
determining
the
voluntariness
of
a
confession
is
to
look
through
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
defendant's
will
or
mind
and
the
pressures
applied
to
his
power
of
resistance.
how
did
this
case
meet
the
test?
in
our
brief,
the
parties
have
discussed
pro
and
con,
atchley's
business
acumen
and
success.
yet,
perhaps
on
reflection,
this
may
not
be
such
a
weigh
consideration
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
atchley
wasn't
brawl
beaten
into
a
confession,
by
threats
or
by
promises.
he
was
deceived
into
a
confession
he
did
not
know
he
was
making.
he
thought
he
was
arranging
insurance
business.
theretofore
by
his
own
methods,
he
had
resisted
the
efforts
of
the
authorities
to
obtain
a
confession
from
him.
once
again,
spano
comes
to
mind.
spano
resisted
by
following
to
a
point.
by
following
his
attorney's
advice
and
refusing
to
answer
questions.
atchley
without
the
benefit
of
legal
counsel,
resisted
by
giving
false
and
contradictory
statements
to
his
questioners.
he
consistently
resisted
up
to
the
time
when
he
was
taken
in
by
one
who
he
thought
was
acting
for
his
best
interests.
that
is
to
say
he
resisted
those
whom
he
knew
to
be
against,
but
yielded
to
the
pressures
of
one
whom
he
thought
was
acting
for
him.
i
dare
say
that
any
of
us
regardless
of
education
or
worldly
success,
similarly
situated,
might
be
similarly
deceived.
but
regardless
of
situation
in
life,
none
can
breathe
easily
of
confession
obtained
by
these
means,
maybe
used
as
the
basis
for
a
conviction.
and
yet
in
another
aspect,
it
may
be
the
fact
that
atchley
was
unlettered
and
no
hardened
experienced
criminal,
does
have
relevance.
being
so,
he
would
feel
all
the
more
helpless
in
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself.
his
repeated
request
for
an
attorney
indicates
that
he
knew
he
was
not
capable
by
himself
of
coping
with
the
power
of
state,
which
was
set
against
him.
that
atchley
was
then
some
40
years
old,
that
his
mentality
has
not
really
appear,
except
perhaps
inferentially
from
the
testimony
as
to
his
limited
schooling
and
the
various
menial
jobs
he
had
held.
this
--
this
sheds
no
breaking
light
on
whether
or
not
his
confession
was
voluntary.
as
we
read
the
cases
when
a
great
weight
is
given
to
the
youthful
age
of
the
defendant
as
in
payne
versus
alabama
or
to
his
low
mentality
as
in
fikes,
such
factors
are
considered
with
regard
to
the
defendant's
weakness
and
susceptibility.
in
this
light,
atchley's
lack
of
education
and
his
never
having
been
--
before
been
charged
with
a
major
crime,
do
enter
into
the
account.
weighing
atchley's
powers
of
resistance,
as
we
have
said
which
are
indicated
rather
meekly
in
the
record,
against
the
weight
of
the
fraud
which
was
practiced
on
him.
it
is
not
so
difficult
to
find
coercion
is
present.
it
was
not
so
much
that
atchley's
power
of
resistance
was
overcome
as
that
it
was
circumvented.
that
the
net
result
is
the
same,
the
methods
are
--
is
unconscionable
and
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
and
both
that
is
submitted
work
a
denial
of
due
process.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
well,
i'm
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
--
in
the
record
affords
no
violence,
you
honor,
but
i
say
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
you're
talking
about
the
officer
that
was
there?
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
well,
there
were
several
statements,
but
perhaps,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
refer
to
statements
to
mr.
(inaudible)
of
the
state
department
of
investigation
and
one
of
the
deputy
sheriffs.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
before
doing
that,
if
i
may,
most
respectfully,
i
would
like
to
say
that
he
had
actually
requested
to
see
travers
before,
but
--
and
he
made
his
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
--
phone
call
and
travers
then
arrived
subsequently
to
this
conversation
to
what
you
would
referred.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
we
would
attack
it,
although
perhaps
not
so
strongly,
on
the
grounds
that
still
there
remains
denial
of
his
request
for
counsel,
there
still
remains
the
fact
that
he's
been
kept
sleepless
as
--
as
shown
in
the
record.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
that
point
was
not
reached
in
the
brief
though.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
this,
we
have
done.
feeling
that
if
it
so
completely
vitiates
the
trial,
that
perhaps
in
a
sense,
the
other
statement
was
of
secondary
importance
in
the
light
in
which
we
are
now
examining
the
case.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
give
me
one
moment.
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
think
--
i
think
they're
in
our
responses
mr.
justice
clark
and
i
--
i
believe
--
ms.
rosalie
s.
asher
i
know
they
appear
in
one
of
the
briefs,
if
not
in
both.
we
should
also
like
to
consider
the
case
alongside
of
blackburn
versus
alabama,
where
the
defendant
was
probably
insane
and
incompetent
when
he
confessed.
have
put
differently,
his
mental
illness
was
one
cause
of
the
confession
with
being
involuntary.
here,
having
been
duked
as
a
result
of
a
conspiracy
between
travers
and
the
undersheriff,
atchley's
confession
was
likewise
involuntary.
in
the
one
case,
it
was
the
mental
condition
of
the
defendant
created
by
his
own
illness,
which
prevented
him
from
exercising
his
freewill.
in
the
other,
here,
it
is
the
defendant's
mental
condition
as
created
--
created
by
the
artifice
of
the
state,
recognizing
as
in
blackburn
that
we
are
necessarily
dealing
with
probabilities.
it
may
be
that
atchley
would
still
have
confessed
had
he
been
afforded
his
--
all
of
his
constitutional
safeguards.
ultimately,
this
court
of
courts
will
determine
the
effect
of
the
circumstances
of
atchley's
freewill.
it
is
respectfully
urged
that
it
may
be
pertinent
to
a
determination
of
this
fact
that
repeated
interrogation
of
one
who
is
ignorant
of
his
rights,
cut
off
from
his
friend
and
denied
the
aid
of
an
attorney,
may
be
a
coercive
technique,
if
not
one
of
intimidation
or
of
torture.
we
feel
that
the
methods
here
employed
are
just
a
sacrificial
of
human
values
as
were
those
which
were
condemned
in
blackburn.
the
matter
of
a
way
to
be
accorded
the
decision
of
california
supreme
court
has
been
--
have
been
discussed
adequately,
we
believe,
in
the
briefs.
and
--
but
one
short
moment
will
be
devoted
to
it
now.
we
have
noted
in
our
response
that
in
upholding
the
--
the
judgment
of
conviction,
the
california
court
did
so
impart
upon
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
not
suggested
the
recorded
statements
were
untrue.
in
addition,
as
we
did
not
argue
in
the
brief,
they
held
the
--
deception
practiced
upon
the
defendant
was
--
was
not
--
did
not
render
the
statements
inadmissible
for
the
stated
reason
that
it
was
not
of
a
type
reasonably
likely
to
procure
an
untrue
statement.
it
is
submitted
that
the
decision
of
the
state
court
thus
shows
on
its
face
that
it
did
in
fact
settle
the
question
of
admissibility
by
giving
consideration
to
the
probable
truth
or
falsity
of
the
confession.
a
standard,
which
now
appears
clearly
impermissible,
was
rogers
versus
richmond.
that
being
true,
the
state
determination
is
entitled
to
little
weight
here
and
it
remains
for
this
court
on
the
undisputed
facts
of
record,
to
weigh
the
case
against
the
standards
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
to
determine
whether
or
not,
this
was
such
a
coerced
and
involuntary
confession
as
to
fall
without
the
bounds
of
due
process.
what
would
be
the
effect
of
a
formal
conviction?
one
result
would
be
to
lend
support
to
the
idea
that
the
police
can
do
no
wrong,
which
in
turn
would
lead
to
that
inquisitorial
system
without
safeguards,
which
was
condemned
in
watts
versus
indiana.
it
would
portend
the
situation
that
then
caused
envisage
when
he
said,
“it
is
all
right
to
preserve
freedom
in
constitutions,
but
when
the
spirit
of
freedom
has
freed
from
--
fled
from
the
hearts
of
the
people,
then
the
matter
is
easily
enough
sacrifice
under
the
law”.
and
what
if
the
conviction
is
struck
down
because
of
the
mean
dues
to
secure
the
confession
in
which
it
--
in
so
large
part
rests?
it
will
place
no
undue
burdens
on
the
police
in
the
proper
and
necessary
exercise
of
their
functions
required
for
the
protection
of
society.
it
will
merely
enunciate
once
again
the
doctrine
of
malinski
and
spano
and
blackburn
and
other
cases.
that
the
standards
of
decency
established
by
our
constitution
are
paramount
and
that
in
the
end,
illegal
means
are
as
great
key
dangers
as
--
are
the
miscreants.
it
is
right
to
punish
crime.
it
is
necessary,
but
some
methods
are
more
dangerous
to
society
as
we
know
it
and
more
obnoxious
to
honest
men
than
crime
itself.
it
is
submitted
that
to
condone
the
methods
here
used
to
obtain
a
confession,
is
to
open
the
doors
to
ever
widening
abuses
of
constitutionally
secured
rights.
wisely
as
it
been
said
that
vigilance
is
the
eternal
price
of
liberty,
to
reverse
because
of
the
method
of
securing
atchley's
confession,
would
be
no
innovation,
no
new
encroachment
on
the
powers
in
the
state
of
california
or
of
any
other
state,
in
the
supervision
of
their
own
criminal
proceedings.
it
would
be
but
another
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
many
of
them
sighted
here
today,
applying
a
familiar
rule,
but
in
the
exercise
of
their
powers,
the
states
are
constitutionally
limited
by
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
would
merely
delineate
one
more
set
of
facts,
which
constitute
a
type
of
coercion
banned
by
that
amendment.
so
far
as
our
research
is
disclosed,
this
court
has
not
yet
held
in
so
many
words.
but
a
confession
secured
by
fraud,
collusion
or
trickery,
results
in
fundamental
unfairness
of
equal
and
dignity
with
that
caused
by
physical
force
or
psychological
coercion.
some
of
the
language
in
lisenba
versus
california
indicates
this
might
be
the
law.
of
course
the
facts
in
--
presented
in
lisenba
were
held
to
measure
up
the
constitutional
standards.
however,
we
rely
here
not
merely
on
a
different
set
of
facts,
which
appear
from
the
record.
but
we
also
say
that
while
california
may
adopt
any
rule
it
elect
whether
or
not
in
conforme
with
the
federal
practice,
it
cannot
by
doing
so
foreclose
inquiry
in
this
case,
as
to
whether
the
application
of
the
rule
has
worked
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
our
position
is
that
the
fraud,
collusion
and
deception
here
present,
militate
against
--
petitioner's
confession
being
the
product
of
any
meaningful
act
of
volition
on
his
part
and
hence,
blocking
the
fundamental
imperatives
of
justice
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
these
methods
are
more
subtle
and
sophisticated
than
the
brutal
use
of
force
present
in
brown
versus
mississippi.
but
no
one
will
argue
that
the
evils
at
which
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
aimed,
are
no
longer
a
consequence
when
confessions
are
merely
not
extorted
by
physical
violence,
regardless
of
how
they
made
otherwise
the
coerced
and
involuntarily.
mr.
oetje
john
rogge,
former
assistant
united
states
attorney,
in
his
book,
"why
men
confess"
points
out
that
the
communists
very
rarely
resort
--
resort
to
physical
violence
in
the
extraction
of
confessions.
he
says
if
they
do
so,
no
more
frequently
than
do
the
police
in
this
country,
for
the
reasons
that
these
methods
hadn't
been
found
not
necessary
and
frequently
self-defeating.
spano
tells
us
that
the
safeguards
of
the
constitution
still
obtained
against
these
sophisticated
and
subtle
methods.
every
step
in
the
requirements
of
criminal
procedure
has
come
from
the
humane
feelings
of
man.
and
as
man
has
enlightened,
has
become
more
enlightened,
laws
have
gradually
changed
and
modified
to
conform
to
the
--
to
conform
to
the
advancing
civilizations.
they
have
not
remained
static
and
immutable.
mr.
rogge
phrases
this
far
better
than
i.
he
says,
“the
inquisitional
system
stands
in
the
way
of
the
development
of
equalitarian
societies
in
the
growth
of
human
beings
into
mature
individuals.”
surely
we
haven't
reached
at
least
one
--
reached
that
stage
of
civilization,
where
the
methods
shown
here
are
apart.
to
find
that
veron
atchley
did
not
have
a
fair
trial
is
but
to
inform
to
the
cases
to
which
we
have
referred,
to
extend
their
rule
to
a
different
factual
situation
and
to
pronounce
once
again
that
our
constitution
forbids
a
foothold
to
deception,
brainwashing
and
other
totalitarian
device.
mr.
rosalie
s.
asher
we
have
no
objection
your
honor.
i
would
naturally
like
to
examine
this.
however,
i
think
it
will
pour
a
little
light
on
the
question
as
ms.
maier
has
explained.
this
--
this
first
arraignment
in
the
justices'
court,
there
are.
these
are
not
stenographic
minutes
but
merely
the
--
the
minute
order
at
entry.
then
there
are,
although
i
don't
know
whether
this
or
has
it
or
not,
stenographic
notes
as
to
what
we
referred
to
in
california
as
the
preliminary
hearing
which
follows
this
first
hearing
as
to
which
she
--
or
you
have
requested
the
order.
mr.
rosalie
s.
asher
the
court
permission
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
just
one
or
two
very
brief
things
to
say
in
reply
tonight.
mr.
rosalie
s.
asher
thank
you
sir.
my
worthy
opponent
and
i
are
agreed
on
the
issues
here
before
this
court
and
they
need
not
to
further
be
discussed.
it
resolves
itself
into
perhaps
a
rather
simple,
factual
question.
however,
i
do
wish
to
apologize
for
the
statement
i
made
this
morning
to
secure
from
colleague
as
to
the
time
of
arraignment
with
regard
to
the
statement.
i
don't
wish
to
get
involved
in
this
arraignment
thing
again
but
counsel
and
i
were
thinking
of
arraignment
in
the
superior
court
and
that
would
explain
the
wrong
--
factually
incorrect
statement
i
made.
i
think
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that
there
is
no
affirmative
act
by
the
police
to
show
him.
it's
true
they
have
no
duty
to
provide
a
man
with
a
lawyer.
an
indigent
is
afforded
a
lawyer
by
the
courts
of
california
in
the
courts.
however,
we
do
maintain
that
if
a
man
in
police
custody,
unable
accepting
with
the
indulgence
of
the
police
to
contact
counsel,
asks
to
do
so,
then
this
is
his
right.
i
have
rather
briefly
reviewed
the
record
being
at
the
same
disadvantage
as
mrs.maier
and
i
having
been
at
the
trial
of
the
case.
however,
i
don't
find
that
record
so
clearly
shows
that
this
matter
regarding
counsel
in
actually
a
statement
to
travers,
the
tape
recorded
statement
appearing
at
page
201.
travers
says,
the
question,
“well,
that's
about
all
i
can
there,
when
you
get
your
attorney.”
i
don't
know
who
your
attorney
is.
what
was
that
fellow's
name?
answer,
“i
was
trying
to
get
(inaudible)
as
it
appears
in
the
record.
(inaudible)
"yes."
san
jose."
san
jose
is
the
question.
and
then
travers
says,
“there
is
nothing
we
can
do.
all
we
can
do
is
what
your
request
to
the
company,
going
back
again
to
the
question
of
insurance."
then
at
the
section
with
which
mrs.
maier
referred
to
regarding
the
testimony
of
the
--
i
take
it
this
is
--
yes,
this
is
the
defendant's
brother's
testimony
at
page
354
and
355.
we
are
handicapped
here
by
again
the
limited
education
of
both
defendant
and
his
brother
because
the
question
was
put
to
him,
to
the
brother
on
cross
examination
by
the
prosecution.
"you
have
been
in
this
particular
matter.
has
been
associated
with
your
brother
trying
to
help
him
out
in
your
defense
have
you
not?”
answer,
“in
his
defense,
i
just
sat
and
heard
it
the
same
as
anybody
else.”
question,
"well,
you
have
conferred
with
him
at
various
times
over
in
the
jail
working
out
matters
of
his
defense,
didn't
you?”
answer,
“well,
i
just
conceded
for
his
lawyer.”
now,
i
submitted,
he
probably
--
i
would
assume
he
meant
but
still
the
time
of
this
intercession
does
not
appear
from
the
statement
although
the
brother
goes
on
to
testify,
“yes,
we
discussed
about
my
other
brother.
we
talked
about
that
a
whole
lot
down
in
the
jail."
oh
yes,
the
question
was
asked
this
morning
as
to
the
reference,
in
the
record
to
actually
request
for
counsel
and
that
appears
as
is
mentioned
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
--
in
the
record,
pages
382
and
436.
i
think
the
later
statement
--
the
statement
made
to
police
officers,
after
the
statement
made
to
travers
actually
is
a
bit
beyond
the
orbit
of
the
question
here.
attention
should
be
focused
it
seems
to
me
on
this
one
question.
did
actually,
at
any
time
before
his
interview
with
travers
tells
the
story
that
he
then
told
and
the
answer
is
that
he
did
not.
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
admitted
coming
in
--
coming
to
the
scene
in
possession
of
the
gun.
the
affect
of
the
--
this
whole
tape
being
played
to
the
jury
heard
by
their
ears,
i
think
cannot
be
minimized.
if
nothing
else
but
for
this
tape
which
we
still
perfectly
maintain
was
the
result
of
coercion
in
a
manner
argued
this
morning.
if
defendant
had
not
been
acquitted
outright,
there
is
a
reasonable
possibility
i
think
that
he
would
have
received
a
lesser
penalty.
california
as
so
many
other
states
has
varying
degree
of
homicide
and
but
for
the
damning
tape
confession,
it
--
i
think
cannot
be
said
be
on
certainty
that
he
might
not
have
been
found
guilty
of
manslaughter
or
of
second
degree
murder
or
indeed
if
he
were
still
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder.
but
for
the
fact
that
this
tape
having
been
played,
it
will
might
be
that
the
jury
would
have
brought
in
a
recommendation
with
leniency
as
in
this
case,
they
did
not
do
it.
mr.
rosalie
s.
asher
mr.
chief
justice,
that
does
appear
in
the
argument.
we
have
answered
that
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
rosalie
s.
asher
our
contention
is
that
he
has
no
choice.
that
this
was
just
a
matter
of
defense
strategy,
virtually
imposed
upon
him
by
the
methods
of
the
prosecution.
mr.
rosalie
s.
asher
and
i
would
like
to
further
point
out
because
there
maybe
some
further
confusions
in
the
record.
the
record
will
show
that
as
the
arraignment
in
the
superior
court,
the
defendant
was
represented
by
mr.
king,
however,
that
is
not
this
mr.
king.
mr.
joseph
r.
king
represented
him
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
mr.
albert
king,
my
associate's
brother
is
the
one
mentioned
at
the
superior
court
arraignment.
