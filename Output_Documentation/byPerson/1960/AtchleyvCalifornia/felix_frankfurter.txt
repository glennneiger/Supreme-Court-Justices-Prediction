justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
hear
that
ms.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
he
was
arraigned
before
the
justices'
court
before
the
travers
point
of
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
dis
--
what
disposition?
what
was
the
formal
disposition
following
the
arraignment
or
the
result
of
or
in
connection
with
the
arraignment
of
the
justices'
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
a
single
judge
or
single
judge
--
single
presiding
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
--
before
the
superior?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it'd
be
--
at
the
justices'
court
--
just
one
session
before
it,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
arraignment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
same
justices?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
was
that
--
pardon
me.
when
was
that
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
you
say
he's
advised
of
his
rights,
what
was
that
include?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
although,
that
was
on
the
4th
of
august?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
although
it
isn't
in
the
record
in
this
printed
volume,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
in
this
printed
volume.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
although
it
is
not
here
you
say
that
as
a
matter
of
local
practice,
the
very
function
of
arraignment
before
the
justices'
court
is
to
advise
him
with
all
his
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
do
want
to
know
whether
that
initial
arraignment
on
the
4th,
he
was
told
of
his
right
to
including
you
may
have
lawyer
you
wanted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
was
--
what
--
did
he
express
a
desire
to
have
one
or
would
this
being
a
capital
case,
would
one
be
assigned
to
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
there
is
no
and
--
were
you
in
the
proceedings
before
the
state
supreme
court
ms.
maier?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
question
--
what
was
the
question
--
the
issue
raised
for
your
supreme
court
that
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer
and
that
he
wasn't
properly
advised
to
respond
to
whatever
the
extent
of
the
proceedings
before
the
justices'
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
a
little
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
if
he
was
--
if
he
appeared,
if
he
was
arraigned
before
your
justices'
court
on
august
4
and
that
told
that
he
may
have
a
lawyer
of
his
choice
and
if
he
doesn't
have
any
fund
with
which
to
select
the
lawyer
of
his
choice,
the
statement
provide
to
him.
if
all
of
that
was
made
clear
to
him,
then
i
do
not
understand
why
he
didn't
have
a
lawyer,
select
a
lawyer
or
express
a
desire
to
have
the
state
select
one
before
him
if
he
was
indigent
before
he
ever
made
the
statement
to
action,
to
travers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
turn
as
to
page
382
of
the
record?
oh
this
is
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes.
yes,
3
--
on
page
382.
(inaudible)
mrs.
maier.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
going
to
trouble
you
to
elucidate
from
the
--
where
the
new
ones
when
examination
with
several
hours
were
a
couple
days,
didn't
you?
well,
from
saturday
all
day,
no
sleep,
saturday
night,
no
sleep,
sunday,
no
sleep,
sunday
night,
no
sleep
until
about
4
o'clock.
i
presume
i
went
to
a
pretty
good
examination.
am
i
to
infer
from
that
that
he
was
continued
--
continuously
under
interrogation
by
enforcing
officials
of
california
no
sleep,
is
that
it?
am
i
to
infer
that
that
means
they
kept
him
from
sleep?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
sunday
following
this
saturday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
--
but
the
answer
is
responsive
to
the
question
and
you
went
to
an
examination
for
several
hours.
did
he
go
through
an
examination
before
the
shooting?
i
don't
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
from
saturday
all
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
you
talking
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
the
shooting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
doesn't
tie
it
up
with
an
examination,
does
that?
alright,
now
go
on
to
the
next
question.
how
many
times
did
you
ask
for
a
lawyer,
would
you
say?
i
would
say
i
asked
for
a
lawyer
10
times.
and
you
asked,
how
many
people,
well
everyone
that
i've
talked
to,
i'm
asking
for
a
lawyer?
now,
would
you
please
comment
on
that
ms.
maier's?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
the
claim
and
is
the
claim
made
that
he
asked
public
authorities
to
be
allowed
to
get
a
lawyer
and
maybe
they
blocked
him
from
doing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
can
we
say
then
that
there
is
out
of
this
case
any
claim
or
basis
for
regret,
that
here
was
the
defendant
unable
to
apply
--
supply
himself
with
a
lawyer,
frustrated
in
the
desire
to
do
so
by
officials
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
supposed
whether
you
have
an
indictment
or
not,
but
i
don't
suppose
because
i
don't
know.
whether
you
have
an
indictment
or
not,
does
that
lie
within
the
choice
of
the
district
attorney?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
--
does
the
accused
when
he
gets
before
at
the
second
--
at
the
second
stage
of
appearance
before
the
justices'
court,
does
the
accused
may
put
in
a
case
contradictory
to
the
states
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case,
was
there
anything
like
that
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
superior
court
is
nearly
--
there
was
here,
proceeding
before
the
superior
court,
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
a
proceeding
before
the
superior
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
that
that's
where
the
trial
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ms.
maier,
i
would
--
i
for
one
would
like
to
see
if
you
have
available,
if
you
happen
to
have
here
the
briefs
but
before
your
supreme
court
has
led
to
this
justice
traynor's
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
leaving
it
--
leaving
it
to
the
clerk
and
he'll
return
to
you?the
defendant
has
--
the
petitioner
has
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
this
case
is
taking
a
course
of
discussion
here
that
i
for
one
do
not
find
reflected
in
justice
traynor's
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
three
years,
i
think
we
--
the
opinion
of
this
court
would
have
to
sustain
it
with
that
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
resist,
resist
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
he
required
to
resist
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
wasn't
told?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
asked
in
all
innocence,
but
so
much
stress
was
laid
by
on
the
fact
that
travers
had
been
by
this
action,
travers
has
had
been
a
deputy
sheriff.
aren't
the
deputy
sheriffs
in
california
normally,
technically,
scientifically
equipped
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
--
that's
why
i
asked.
is
that
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
(voice
overlap)
take
notice
that
in
nevada,
they
don't
have
to
be
scientific.
