justice

ms.
maier,
i
still
don't
entirely
understand
this
arraignment
as
the
word
that's
usually
used
and
apparently
is
usually
used
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court
because
it
means
different
things
and
different
stages.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
in
california,
they
--
the
first
arraignment
in
the
justices'
court
is
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
advising
the
man
of
his
rights,
his
right
to
counsel
and
what
else?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
he
--
does
he
enter
a
plea
at
that
first
arraignment
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
no
plea?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
filed
in
the
supereme
court?
you
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
don't
ever
have
indictments?
justice
potter
stewart
one
or
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
but
first
on
there's
an
arraignment
on
the
justices'
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
at
which
time
he's
advised
of
his
rights
and
a
date
is
set
for
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
comes
the
preliminary
hearing
at
which
time
it's
incumbent
upon
the
prosecution
of
a
prima
facie
case?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
followed
by
either
--
he's
bound
over
there
i
--
i
don't
know
if
you
call.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
he
--
and
this
is
followed
by
an
information
or
and
indictment
which
is
filed
in
the
superior
court
at
which
time
there
follows
another
arraignment
at
which
he
makes
a
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
always
an
information
on
that
case
advised.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
he'd
been
a
deputy
sheriff
in
nevada,
