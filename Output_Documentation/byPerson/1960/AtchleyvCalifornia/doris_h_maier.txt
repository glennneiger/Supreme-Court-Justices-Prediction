ms.
doris
h.
maier
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
questions
discussed
today
are
slightly
different
than
the
position
taken
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
was
presented
to
this
court.
we
plea
that
the
basic
question
before
this
court
is
whether
petitioner's
conviction
resulted
from
the
employment
of
constitutionally
impermissible
methods
by
the
state's
law
enforcement
officers
and
hence,
whether
petitioner
was
denied
due
process
of
law
into
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
this,
the
two
subsidiary
questions,
first,
was
a
coerced
statement
used
at
or
a
confession
used
to
this
trial
and
second,
was
the
alleged
denial
of
counsel
sufficient
to
vitiate
the
state
proceedings.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
state
briefly
the
facts
in
this
case.
mrs.
atchley,
the
petitioner's
wife,
was
shot
and
killed
in
her
front
yard
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
august
the
3rd,
1958
in
gridley,
california.
previously,
she
had
separated
from
her
husband.
on
the
evening
of
august
the
2nd,
she
had
taken
her
daughter
and
another
couple
to
a
dance
and
was
absent
from
the
house.
while
she
was
absent,
at
about
12:30
that
evening,
defendant
came
to
the
house.
he
saw
no
one
was
home.
he
left.
he
searched
for
another
places.
he
then
returned
to
her
house
with
a
loaded
gun
in
his
belt,
parked
his
car
a
block
away
from
her
home
and
approached
the
house
through
the
back
alley.
he
remained
in
the
shed
at
the
side
premises
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
then
waited
at
the
back
end
side
of
the
house
until
the
headlights
of
her
car
appeared.
when
mrs.
atchley
appeared
with
her
car,
she
proceeded
to
the
front
door
of
her
house
with
the
keys
in
her
hand.
petitioner
stepped
around
the
house
and
confronted
her.
in
the
next
few
moments,
mrs.
atchley
was
shot
some
six
times.
five
empty
cartridge
cases
were
found,
so
close
together,
to
show
that
the
shots
had
been
fired
from
a
gun
in
approximately
the
same
position.
the
victim's
clothing
indicated
that
the
gun
was
held
at
least
two
feet
from
the
victim
at
the
time
of
the
shooting.
next
door
neighbors
had
been
awakened
during
the
course
of
this
practice.
they
heard
a
woman
cry.
they
observed
petitioner
in
a
stooping
position
shooting
toward
the
ground.
a
fence
destroyed
their
view
of
the
body.
they
inquired
as
to
what
was
going
on,
whereupon
petitioner
immediately
left
the
scene
and
went
back
to
his
car,
secured
it
and
drove
away
at
fast
rate
of
speed.
he
returned
to
his
home
in
palermo
where
he
concealed
the
holster
and
the
gun
used
in
the
killing.
he
then
went
to
bed.
this
was
approximately
3
a.m.
meanwhile,
the
police
were
notified.
they
arrived
at
the
scene
and
petitioner
was
contacted.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
at
this
point
we
have
reached
the
scene
of
the
shooting
which
was
3:07
a.m.
petitioner
was
contacted
by
the
police
at
his
home
in
palermo
at
approximately
4
a.m.
and
brought
to
the
county
jail.
he
was
first
questioned
in
the
county
jail
by
one
officer
for
a
period
of
approximately
two
and
a
half
hours.
at
that
time,
petitioner
denied
being
in
gridley
having
any
gun
and
gave
a
statement
that
perhaps
someone
else
had
threatened
his
wife
and
may
have
shot
her.
petitioner
was
not
again
questioned
until
11:30
p.m.
on
that
night
august
the
3rd.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
at
night.
at
that
time,
an
investigator
for
the
state
department
of
justice
arrived
in
oroville.
he
introduced
himself
to
the
petitioner
who
knew
he
was
booked
for
investigation
of
murder.
there
were
--
the
record
shows
that
there
were
no
promises,
threats
or
inducements
made
by
this
officer
to
the
petitioner.
petitioner
told
the
officer
the
same
story
that
he
had
told
mr.
anderson,
the
first
person
that
had
questioned
him.
he,
however,
did
admit
in
this
statement
that
at
sometime
he
had
previously
threatened
his
wife.
a
subsequent
conversation
was
held
with
the
petitioner
by
three
other
officers
and
the
questioning
lasted
until
about
5
a.m.
when
petitioner
went
to
his
cell
to
sleep.
his
story
was
the
same
as
to
the
second
officer.
at
noon
on
august
the
4th
after
the
police
had
located
the
gun
and
holster
on
the
petitioner's
premises,
they
returned
to
the
jail
and
confronted
him
with
these
articles.
they
made
no
threats
or
promises
to
him.
and
on
the
contrary
when
petitioners
saw
him
with
these
articles,
he
stated,
"i
heard
you
had
located
the
gun."
he
then
changed
his
story
to
the
officers,
admitted
that
his
first
story
was
false.
he
admitted
then
that
he
had
been
in
gridley
on
the
night
in
question
that
the
gun
had
gone
off
as
a
result
of
a
struggle
with
his
wife
for
this
gun
but
he's
dead
at
that
time
that
she
was
in
possession
of
the
gun
and
when
she
was
lying
in
the
ground
after
having
been
shot,
he
took
the
gun
and
drove
back
to
palermo
where
he
buried
the
gun
and
concealed
the
holster.
we
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
petitioner
sometime
on
the
day
of
august
4th
was
arraigned
in
the
justice
court
at
6
p.m
on
that
day.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
this
is
before
the
statement
to
travers.
the
record
--
we
will
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
record
before
this
court
does
not
show
that
fact
but
this
is
the
record
of
the
justice
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
proceedings
on
the
motion
to
set
aside
in
the
superior
court
are
in
the
record
your
honor,
and
no
question
at
that
time
was
raised
as
to
any
delay
in
arraignment.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
honor,
he
was
but
they
are
not
in
the
record
before
this
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
honor
i
do
not
know
whether
he
was
represented
at
that
time
by
counsel
or
not.
i
was
not
present
in
that
and
we
nearly
handled
the
appeal.
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
we
know
what
the
preliminary
examination
and
the
motion
to
set
aside
which
will
be
reflected
in
this
record.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
your
honor
the
arraignment
was
prior
to
the
conversation
with
mr.
travers.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
original
record
i
understand
is
on
file,
a
certified
copy
of
it.
and
your
honor
in
california,
there
are
two
arraignments,
one
in
the
justice
court
and
one
again
on
the
superior
court
after
he
is
held
to
answer.
you
will
note
in
the
record
before
this
court
or
in
the
breached
record
as
well
the
proceedings
begin
with
the
motion
to
set
aside
the
information
in
the
superior
court,
not
in
the
justice
court
where
a
preliminary
examination
was
held.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
he
was
brought
before
the
justice
court
on
august
the
4th.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
on
august
the
4th.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
--
he
telephoned
travers
on
6
--
at
6
p.m.
on
august
the
4th
and
his
statement
with
travers
was
on
august
the
5th.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
after
the
arraignment
in
the
justice
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well
in
the
--
the
arraignment
proceeding
there
is
merely
an
advice
--
in
california
is
merely
an
advice
as
to
their
right.
a
date
is
set
for
a
preliminary
examination
at
that
time,
a
preliminary
examination
was
held
in
this
matter
on,
i
believe
august
the
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
not
before
the
superior
but
before
the
judges.
if
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
hold
the
defendant
to
answer,
then
he
is
held
to
answer
in
the
superior
court,
the
district
attorney
files
an
information
there.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
one
arraignment
proceeding.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
and
then
at
a
later
date,
a
preliminary
examination
is
held.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
before
the
same
justice.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
honor,
i
could
only
go
by
a
certified
copy
of
the
document.
it
is
not
in
the
record
before
this
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
to
remain
silent
is
normal,
advised
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
on
the
4th
of
august.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
understand
--
yes,
your
honor.
now,
we
are
not
sure
whether
it
is
in
the
record
before
the
california
supreme
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
it's
not
in
that
body.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
is
correct.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
is
correct.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
end
to
discover
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
at
that
time
to
hold
him
to
answer
the
filing
of
an
information,
where
in
the
state
of
california,
there
is
both
the
proceeding
by
information
or
indictment.
the
information
was
the
proceeding
used
in
this.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
not
at
the
arraignment.
they
--
they
sent
a
date
for
a
subsequent
preliminary
examination.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
honor
if
he
expressed
a
desire
that
time
for
an
attorney
and
he
had
no
funds
to
secure
attorney,
then
one
would
have
been
appointed
to
represent
him.
however,
this
petitioner
as
reflected
by
the
record
did
have
funds
to
hire
and
did
engage
his
own
counsel.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
your
honor,
not
that.
the
question
was
raised,
if
i
may
explain
to
you,
your
honor.
the
question
was
raised
before
the
california
supreme
court
as
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
whether
his
statement
that
he
was
in
the
in
this
record
that
i
want
an
attorney
and
that
he
didn't
get
an
attorney
at
that
time,
whether
that
affected
the
introduction
of
the
statement
in
evidence.
it
was
not
--
no
question
was
raised
either
in
his
motion
to
set
aside
the
information
in
the
california
court
or
the
supreme
court.
i'm
trying.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
honor,
the
only
thing
we
could
infer
from
the
record
in
this
case
including
his
statement
to
mr.
travers
was
that
petitioner
at
that
time
through
his
brother
was
negotiating
for
various
counsel.
you
will
see
in
the
statement
to
travers
that
he
says
he
is
endeavoring
to
secure
a
counsel
and
he's
been
trying
to
get
several
people.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
your
honor.
in
the
first
place
may
i
explain?
the
shooting
took
place
in
the
early
hours
of
sunday
morning.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
no
the
sunday
--
he
says
no
sleep
saturday,
no
--
all
day,
no
sleep
saturday
night.
the
shooting
didn't
take
place
until
after
that
saturday
night.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
he's
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
he
is
talking
about
the
fact
that
on
the
saturday,
in
reading
the
entire
transcript,
you
will
see
on
the
saturday
in
question
he
--
he
didn't
sleep
and
he
didn't
sleep
that
saturday
night.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
before
the
shooting.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
i
would
say
he
probably
--
he
may
have
asked
a
week.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
conflicts
with
that
except
his
own
statement
to
travers
when
he
shows
he
was
negotiating
through
his
brother
for
an
attorney.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
that
any
public
authorities
blocked
him
from
getting
an
attorney.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
there
is
no
affirmative
act
disclosed
there.
the
--
there
is
no
duty
on
the
police
to
provide
counsel
with
an
attorney.
and
if
he
is
not
indigent
and
has
funds
to
maintain
or
update
his
own
counsel,
the
state
court
could
not
appoint
counsel
to
represent
him.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
don't
think
the
facts
in
this
case
support
that.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
cannot,
your
honor.
i
can
only
go
by
a
certified
copy
of
the
docket
of
the
justice
court
which
wouldn't
give
a
date
--
a
time.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
it
was.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i'm
sorry
i
couldn't.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
sheriff?
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
gillick
is
the
sheriff
and
mr.
gornall
is
the
deputy
district
attorney.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
second
arraignment
is
the
arraignment
in
the
superior
court
when
an
information
has
been
filed
which
in
california
is
comparable
to
an
indictment.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
actual
date
of
the
information
in
the
superior
court?
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
information
was
filed
on
august
the
19th
in
the
superior
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
and
the
next
proceeding
--
at
that
time,
the
next
proceedings
are
a
motion
to
set
aside
that
information
on
august
the
29th
by
his
counsel.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
at
different
stages.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
not
to
make
any
statements
that
could
be
held
against
him,
his
right
to
advices
him
of
the
complaint
filed
against
him
and
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
no
plea.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no
because
then
he
is
--
then
he
is
--
a
date
is
set
for
the
preliminary
examination
at
which
the
prosecution
must
present
reasonable
and
probable
cause
to
--
on
which
an
information
is
to
be
based.
if
the
magistrate
determines
as
reasonable
and
probable
cause,
he
holds
this
defendant
to
answer,
and
then
an
information
within
the
limited
time
is
filed
in
supreme
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes
it
--
but
they
are
both
proceedings
in
california
one
or
the
other
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
--
or
alternative.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that's
true.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
but
with
one
exception.
if
you
have
an
indictment,
you
do
not
have
the
preliminary
proceedings.
you
would
have
an
indictment
returned
by
the
grand
jury
in
the
case
of
where
you
have
the
preliminary
proceedings,
you
have
an
information
based
on.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
we
have
them
with
this
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
certified
copy
your
honor
if
you
wish.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
your
honor
he
may
have
presented
his
defense.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i'm
a
--
since
i'm
not
familiar,
i
wasn't
present
at
that
time,
i
understand
that
he
did
not
but
--
i
did
not.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
pardon
me.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
oh
there
was
a
full
trial
in
this
matter
at
which
the
defendant
was
fully
represented
by

degree.

that's
where
the
trial
was.
ms.
doris

no,
there
are
no.

maier
if
you

he
reporter's
transcript

of

there
normally

not.
there
are

would
be
and
was
a
reporters'
transcript
of
the
proceedings
on
the
holding
of
the
preliminary
examination
itself.
and
that
would
have
been
before
the
california
--
could
have
been
before
the
california
supreme
court
had
and
a
question
been
raised
as
to
that
proceeding,
insofar
as
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
information
was
raised
in
the
superior
court.
ms.

there's
a
formal
--
the
formal
minute

the
formal

of
the

ms.
doris
h.

of
the

there
would
be
a

of

there.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
at
the
--
in
the
justice
court.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
it
was
not
because
no
question
was
raised
on
the
appeal
as
to
the
validity
of
the
order
setting
aside
of
failing
to
grant
the

ms.
doris
h.

the
original

yes.
there
--
i

i
have
them

with

here.
they're
not

ms.

i

ms.

ms.
doris
h.
maier
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i
did
not
appear
before
the
supreme
court.
i
don't
have
a
copy
of
the
brief.
we
will
either
leave
or
deliver
one.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
honor,
we
might
explain
it.
justice
traynor
in
his
opinion
and
the
question
presented
to
the
california
supreme
court
was
whether
these
statements
were
admissible
in
evidence.
the
position
of
the
prosecution
at
that
time
was
that
the
statements
that
no
proper
foundation
would
have
too,
would
have
been
light,
to
admit
them
because
under
california
up
to
that
law
and
up
to
that
time,
there
was
no
requirement
that
a
statement
be
voluntary.
we
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
these
statements
were
not
confessions
even
though
we
did
urge
this
point
that
in
this
particular
record,
a
full
and
compete
foundation
was
laid
as
to
their
voluntary
character
and
it
was.
california
court
and
in
mr.
justice
traynor's
opinion
found
that
both
whether
it
was
an
admission
or
confession,
would
have
to
be
voluntary.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
however,
we
would
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
this
--
at
all
statements
made
by
this
petitioner,
the
petitioner's
statements
were
attempt,
all
of
them
to
be
exculpatory.
now,
we
would
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
your
normal
statement
in
the
court,
if
i
may
state
--
reads
as
follows
your
honor,
this
is
a
normal
procedure
there.
"complaint
sign,
defendant
in
custody,
arraignment
held
informed
of
his
legal
rights."
now,
that's
a
minute
order
that
you
have
in
most
justices
courts
because
there
are
very
few
of
them
that
have
reported
transcript
of
that
or
reported
at
that
point.
now,
if
i
may
return
to
the
question
of
why
we
believe
this
record
shows
that
the
petitioners
will
to
resist,
was
not
over
borne
in
this
case.
we
have
these
facts.
petitioner
was
42
years
of
age.
he
was
of
average
intelligence.
he
has
nothing
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
to
--
well
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
is
a
little
difficult
your
honor
because
we
do
not
believe
that
the
statements
were
coerced
from
him.
we
believe
that
statement
he
made
to
mr.
travers,
the
first
statement
was
completely
voluntary
as
the
record
reflects
and
the
second
statement,
the
only
difference
was
the
fact
that
it
was
taped
recorded.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
and
he
wasn't
told
that.
and
some
at
many
years
prior
thereto,
we
do
not
know
how
many.
mr.
travers
happened
to
be
a
deputy
sheriff
in
another
state.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
well,
it
might
depend
on
the
particular
county
in
which
that
was
true.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
under
--
in
most
counties,
no.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
record
shows
that
he
has
been
a
deputy
sheriff
of
the
state
of
nevada.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
if
i
may
--
in
this
case,
in
these
facts
in
which
we
would
say
the
case
is
definitely
differentiated
between
spano
versus
new
york
and
leyra
versus
denno.
in
this,
the
questioning
that
was
continued
with
prior
to
mr.
travers'
statement,
we
have
a
20-hour
space
in
which
petitioner
was
not
questioned
by
any
police
officers
before
he
first
spoke
to
mr.
travers.
at
that
time,
petitioner,
according
to
mr.
travers'
testimony,
petitioner
volunteered
to
him
the
statements
of
the
shooting,
the
facts
arising.
it
was
only
after
mr.
travers
left
the
conversation
with
petitioner,
he'd
finished
and
he
was
leaving
the
jail,
that
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
the
deputy
sheriff
or
into
sheriff
and
they
requested
that
he
repeat
the
statement
and
have
it
so
that
it
could
be
taped.
this,
they
did.
now,
in
most
of
the
cases,
previously
considered
by
this
court,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
first
confessions
have
been
held
coerced
and/or
not
presented
and
a
subsequent
confession
has
been
later
attacked
as
on
the
ground
that
the
coercive
influences
had
carried
through
in
effected.
in
this
case,
we
have
no
first
confession
or
incriminating
statement.
the
first
statement
made
introduce
to
travers
admittedly
is
a
voluntary
one.
petitioner
himself
had
requested
mr.
travers
to
come
to
the
jail.
he
asked
him
to
come
and
discussed
the
question
of
insurance
with
him
and
also
to
bring
him
some
cigarettes.
mr.
travers
went
there
in
accordance
with
that
request.
we
would
also
note
that
the
record
fully
support
the
fact
that
petitioner
at
this
time
apprised
thereto
was
not
held
incommunicado
since
the
--
the
record
reflects
that
his
brother
had
contact
with
him
and
did
discuss
the
matter
with
him.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
at
page
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
believe
it's
354
in
the
record.
he
said
in
this
statement
where
mr.
travers
asked
him
about
counsel,
that
he
was
endeavoring
to
obtain
a
person
by
the
name
bocardo
in
san
jose.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i'm
trying
to
find
it.
201.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
then
the
further
quest
--
point
should
be
noted
that
petitioner
two
days
later
after
the
statement
to
travers,
gave
another
statement
to
the
police
officers
which
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
statement
to
travers.
he
did
not
--
this
statement
was
also
a
free
and
voluntary
on.
i
get
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
i
do
not
know
your
honor
whether
he
had
counsel
at
that
time
or
not.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
yes,
it
would
be
before
that.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
oh
yes,
he
was
also
represented
by
counsel
at
the
preliminary
examination
because
if
you
will
notice
--
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
preliminary
examination,
i
assume
was
august
18.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
the
information
was
filed
on
august
19.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
that
was
given
on
august
the
7th.
then
the
petitioner
--
well,
we
must
also
note
this
point
that
at
the
time
of
trial
in
this
case,
petitioner
took
the
stand
and
testified.
his
statement
at
that
time
was
virtually
identical,
his
testimonies
at
that
time
with
the
contents
of
the
statements
made
to
mr.
travers
and
to
the
officers.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
no,
your
honor
but
petitioner
had
full
opportunity
prior
to
trial
to
review
his
statements
and
also
to
hear
the
tape
recording,
went
to
mr.
travers
because
it
was
avoided
him
prior
to
trial.
ms.
doris
h.
maier
we
would
say
that
in
this
case,
we
differentiated
from
watts
versus
indiana,
leyra
versus
denno
and
all
the
others
in
the
ground
that
we
do
not
have
a
situation
of
a
defendant
of
a
minority,
read
--
race
kept
incommunicado
or
threatened
with
physical
violence.
there
is
no
question
raised
that
are
mapped
violence
or
fought.
we
submit
that
this
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
asked
for
an
attorney.
it
shows
no
affirmative
act
of
the
police
in
refusing
to
permit
an
attorney
to
see
him.
there
was
no
evidence
that
an
attorney
was
turned
away.
it
is
petitioner's
statement
that
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
get
me
an
attorney,
through
the
record,
page
382,
that
they
asked
for
one
and
ten
times.
on
page
354
and
355
of
this
record,
it
shows
that
petitioner's
brother
was
attempting
to
secure
counsel
for
him.
and
we
submit
that
this
case
is
even
a
stronger
case
that
the
police
acted
properly,
then
cicenia
versus
lagay
or
crooker
versus
california.
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
police
refrain
from
questioning
a
suspect
until
he
secures
an
attorney.
such
policy
would
be
a
detriment
to
the
innocent.
it
would
require
the
police
to
keep
these
people
until
such
time
as
they
had
an
attorney
prior
to
being
--
the
individuals
being
able
explain
satisfactorily
to
the
police
and
to
obtain
their
release.
also
if
a
particular
suspect
were
innocent,
he
might
never
to
less
be
able
to
avoid
the
police
a
valuable
clue
to
the
guilty
culprit
which
delay
might
render
unavailable.
we
submit
that
the
record
in
this
particular
case
does
not
show
that
the
petitioner
was
questioned
by
continuous
relays
of
officers
until
he
confessed.
on
the
contrary,
his
alleged
incriminating
statements
were
given
to
his
own
accord
to
mr.
travers.
the
tape
recorded
statement
here
attacked,
was
the
same
as
the
first
one
which
is
admittedly
voluntarily
given
in
neither
these
statements
that
this
petitioner
admit
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
he
admitted
various
incriminating
statements.
we
say,
therefore,
that
petitioner's
will
to
resist
in
entire
confession
was
certain
not
broken
at
that
point
because
at
all
times,
petitioner
did
not
admit
each
and
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
and
we
maintain
that
in
the
light
of
the
entire
records
in
this
case
that
the
state
of
california
has
not
denied
petitioner
that
due
process
of
law
that
were
required
reversal
by
this
court
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
thank
you.
