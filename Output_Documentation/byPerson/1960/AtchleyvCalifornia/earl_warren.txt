versus
california.
ms.
asher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
the
petitioner
made
any
--
any
other
incriminatory
statement
before
this
statement
to
this
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
have
he
admitted
being
present
at
the
scene
of
the
death
of
this
--
of
his
wife
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
was
that
--
when
he
had
--
the
statement
he
made
concerning
his
being
there,
essentially
different
from
what
he
related
to
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
--
is
it
your
position
that
the
petitioner
made
this
statement
to
atchley
or
ashers,
whatever
his
name
was,
(voice
overlap)
in
confidence
or
that
he
made
it
with
the
idea
that
it
--
it
should
be
given
currency?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
--
was
it
much
more
incriminating
than
--
than
the
statement
he
made
to
the
authorities
even
before
he
has
seen
this
man?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
reading
from
--
on
page
1
of
the
briefs,
see
the
states'
brief
at
--
at
page
9,
it
says,
“petitioner
at
this
time
stated
he
had
driven
over
to
gridley
on
the
night
of
the
shooting,
parked
his
car
about
one
and
a
half
blocks
away
from
his
wife's
home,
entered
the
premises
by
a
way
of
the
back
alley
and
spent
some
time
in
the
shed
in
the
rear
of
the
premises.
he
felt
if
his
wife
saw
his
car,
she
would
not
stop.
when
he
heard
his
wife's
car
come
into
the
carport,
he
went
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
proceeded
toward
his
wife.
his
wife
had
a
gun
in
her
hand,
which
after
a
struggle
went
off
several
times.
he
wrestled
his
gun
away
and
it
went
off
several
additional
times,
by
then
she
was
lying
on
the
ground,
so
he
took
the
gun,
drove
back
to
palermo,
buried
the
gun
and
concealed
the
--
concealed
the
holster.”
now
that
was
before
he
had
ever
--
and
that
was
at
afternoon
that
he
asked
to
see
travers.
now,
is
there
any
substantial
--
is
--
isn't
that
as
about
as
incriminating
as
the
--
the
story
that
he
did
tell
travers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
still
claimed
that
it
--
it
was
accidental,
that
she
tried
to
take
the
gun
away
from
him
and
--
and
in
the
struggle,
there
was
some
shots
fired
and
she
was
accidentally
killed.
that
was
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
in
the
other
one
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
--
did
he
ask
travers
to
try
to
get
a
lawyer
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
anything
in
the
record
to
--
to
indicate
whether
or
not
the
police
heard
the
first
conversation
between
travers
and
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
--
ms.
asher,
you
--
you
have
not
mentioned
the
statement
that
the
petitioner
made
to
the
police
before
he
--
he
made
it
to
this
travers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
are
you
attacking
--
are
you
attacking
that
also
as
being
coerced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no
grounds
for
attacking
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
speaking
of
the
one
that
was
made
around
noon
on
the
--
on
the
same
day
that
he
asked
for
his
friend
to
come.
he
made
this
statement
such
as
i
read
from
the
record
to
you
a
little
while
ago.
and
--
and
then
after
he
made
that
statement
as
i
--
as
i
read
the
brief,
he
--
he
then
asked
to
see
his
friend
travers.
now
--
or
what
i'm
asking
is
that
--
do
you
attack
the
statement
that
he
made
before
he
ever
saw
travers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
argued
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
you
placed
your
--
all
your
emphasis
upon
this
statement
made
to
travers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
maier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mrs.
maier.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
11:30
p.m.
at
night?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
before
or
after?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
the
proceedings
of
the
arraignment
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
i
--
what
i
was
interested
in
though
was
he
advised
as
to
his
right
to
counsel
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they're
not
in
the
record.
is
there
anything
to
show
whether
or
not
at
that
time
he
asked
for
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
all
it
is
for,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
maier,
may
i
just
follow
this,
i
have
just
more?
we
were
talking
about
the
arraignment.
i
happen
to
be
familiar
with
it
where
some
of
the
others
do
not.
but
at
the
arraignment,
they
do
not
determine
whether
there
is
probable
cause.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
maier,
may
i
get
back
to
the
crinology
again?
you
told
us
that
--
that
the
petitioner
was
arraigned
before
he
saw
this
man
travers.
now,
he
made
a
statement
to
the
authorities
before
that
in
which
he
admitted
being
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
saying
that
he
had
a
scuffle
and
wife
was
accidently
shot.
can
you
tell
me
what
or
he
was
arraigned
before
that
statement
or
afterwards?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
the
same
date?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
have
your
--
your
brief
before
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
would
you
be
willing
to
leave
it
ms.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
very
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
say
that
in
his
statement
--
in
his
conversation
with
mr.
travers,
he
--
he
said
that
his
brother
was
trying
to
arrange
counsel
for
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
201,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
ms.
asher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
travers,
i
will
--
and
i
--
i
corrected
and
my
recollection
that
some
place
in
the
record,
it's
stated
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
argued
to
the
jury
that
if
this
statement
to
travers
had
not
been
put
in
by
the
prosecution,
he
would've
put
it
in
himself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
thank
you.
