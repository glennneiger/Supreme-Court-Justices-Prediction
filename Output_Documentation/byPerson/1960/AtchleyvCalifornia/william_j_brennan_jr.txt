justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
i
correctly
understand
though
that
mr.
travers
testified
that
when
--
when
he
first
interviewed
atchley
10
o'clock
that
morning
interview,
that
travers
volunteered
everything
which
subsequently,
than
appeared
in
the
tape
recording.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
i
--
if
you
already
suggested
to
the
chief
justice
that
the
--
he
had
an
impression
of
a
limited
circulation,
namely
that
travers
was
taking
a
report
for
the
insurance
company.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
wasn't
any
suggestion
at
any
time
either
the
first
or
second
interview
by
travers
was
there
to
atchley
that
this
would
be
the
only
use
made
of
the
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
actually,
it
was
the
content
of
the
statement,
the
substance
was
exculpatory,
it
wasn't
incriminating,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
did
any
of
the
officers
who
would
interrogate
him,
were
they
asked
when
they
--
when
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
it
might
to
be
ask
for
a
lawyer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
arraignment
was
following
the
conversation
with
travers,
though?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
--
we
have
and
i
take
it
in
the
breached
record
here,
is
the
original
record
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
when
was
he
brought
before
the
justice
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
before
--
what
were
the
dates
of
the
conversations
with
travers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
at
that
time,
had
he
had
a
counsel?
does
the
record
show?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
as
i
understood
your
crinology,
still
a
week
or
two
before
--
i
used
the
term
arraigned,
in
the
superior
court,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he's
--
he
definitely
was
represented
counsel
on
that
occasion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
was
that
?when
was
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
when
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
statement
given
to
the
officers,
identically
you
suggest
in
content
with
that,
which
she'd
given
travers,
was
given
when
the
7th
or
8th?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course
that
would
--
that
doesn't
aid
as
much
in
the
question
whether
they
were
properly
introduce
talking
against
them,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
even,
does
cover,
doesn't
it?
