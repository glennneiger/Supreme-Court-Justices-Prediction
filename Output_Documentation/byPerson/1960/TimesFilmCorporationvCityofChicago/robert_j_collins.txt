mr.
robert
j.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
here
and
these
respondents
have
stipulated
to
the
facts
in
the
court
below
and
i
assume
there
was
no
factual
issue
here
at
all.
counsel
has
hesitated
to
say
that
this
movie
might
be
pornographic,
although
yesterday,
he
did
say
that
it
might
be
pollyanna.
i
presume
from
that,
he
means
that
it
is
innocuous,
harmless.
he
made
a
statement
yesterday
that
i
wrote
down
because
it
sounded
so
strange.
counsel
said
yesterday
to
this
court
that
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
show
the
picture
to
the
respondents
privately
if
they
wish.
i
--
i
cannot
reconcile
that
statement
with
our
being
here
today.
the
ordinance
requires
that
this
picture
or
any
picture
in
our
municipality
be
shown
to
the
respondents
who
is
the
city,
its
mayor
and
police
commissioner,
privately,
and
so
mr.
bilgrey,
if
that
is
your
intention,
we
can
dispose
of
this
lawsuit
now
if
you
will
submit
it
too
as
private.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
justice
frankfurter,
he
did
not
say
that
to
me.
he
said
he
would
exhibit
it
privately
to
the
respondents.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
they
--
they
are
curious.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
of
course,
but
one
of
the
respondents
is
the
municipality.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
right.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
or
to
the
mayor.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
if
he
is
still
willing
to
do
so,
i
invite
mr.
mikva
on
rebuttal
to
say
so
and
we
can
dispose
of
this
suit
immediately.
now,
this
ordinance
is
not
confined,
although
the
court
has
mentioned
pornography
or
obscenity
to
that
question.
the
ordinance
before
this
court
as
you
well
know
prohibits
movies
that
would
lead
to
riots
or
breaches
of
the
peace.
it
may
be
difficult
to
determine
what
they
are
but
until
we
see
the
movie,
we
cannot
possibly
answer
that
question.
it
is
one
of
the
great
problems
with
this
case.
if
we
are
--
all
of
us
dealing
in
the
dark,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
said,
"this
could
depict
an
assassination
of
the
president
of
united
states
for
all
we
know,
a
plan
to
do
it.
now,
let
us
go
back,
mr.
bilgrey
has
said
to
this
court
just
a
moment
ago
that
this
court
has
never
indicated
that
it
might
sustain
a
form
of
prior
restraint.
i
cannot
agree
with
his
statement
there.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
gitlow.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
certainly
would
not,
justice
douglas,
certainly
not.
there
is
a
vast
difference
in
my
judgment
and
of
course,
in
the
legislative
judgment
between
a
newspaper
and
a
--
a
motion
picture.
then,
i
would
like
to
talk
about
that
for
just
a
minute,
the
difference.
when
you
read
a
book
or
a
newspaper
or
a
magazine
in
the
privacy
of
your
home
or
when
you
turn
on
the
television
set
in
your
home
or
the
radio,
that
is
a
different
thing.
if
we
are
dealing
with
an
obscene
pornographic
movie,
then
going
into
a
darkened
theater
with
500
or
1000
or
2000
people
in
close
proximity
and
observing
it,
we
feel
that's
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
they
certainly
do,
sir.
and
the
problem
on
--
on
comic
strips
and
comic
books
is
something
that
has
so
occupied
the
nation
that
as
you
know,
the
congress
has
appointed
a
commission
some
--
up
to
many
years
ago
to
look
into
it.
we
recognize
the
--
the
constitutional
problem
but
that
does
not
take
our
eyes
away
from
the
problem
itself.
you
see
the
--
the
municipalities
under
several
states
have
a
social
problem
or
an
economic
problem
or
a
problem
of
some
kind
and
you
immediate
--
they
enact
legislation.
you
are
not
concerned
with
that
problem,
we
are.
you
are
concerned
only
with
whether
or
not
that
legislation
fits
within
the
framework
of
the
constitution.
when
you
strike
it
down,
the
problem,
it
does
not
disappear,
we
still
have
it.
we
tried
to
change
the
legislation.
we
tried
another
admin
of
approach.
yesterday,
mr.
bilgrey
said
to
this
court,
"if
you
strike
down
legislation,
it
has
no
effect."
now,
that
is
a
statement
he
made
here
yesterday.
now,
of
course,
he
is
concerned.
he
is
an
interested
party.
his
word
may
be
like
mine,
prejudice,
but
two
members
of
this
court,
at
least,
in
the
most
recent
motion
picture
case,
the
kingsley
pictures
case
made
a
statement
that
--
to
the
effect
that
each
time
a
statute
is
struck
down,
the
state
is
left
in
more
confusion.
the
court
recognizes
what
happens
when
legislation
is
stricken
down
but
mr.
bilgrey
said
yesterday,
"they
are
not
--
have
you
have
no
problems
at
all."
i
--
i
cannot
agree
with
that.
and
to
answer
you,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
feel
that
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
movies
and
the
chicago
tribune.
i
wanted
to
say
the
--
the
gitlow
case.
the
gitlow
case
is
a
landmark
decision
of
this
court.
the
gitlow
case
stands
with
the
proposition
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
a
state
from
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
of
the
press.
up
until
that
time,
this
court
have
never
so
held.
but
what
else
was
said
in
the
gitlow
case?
and
incidentally
in
that
case,
as
the
court
knows,
the
legislation
there
with
which
the
court
was
concerned
was
upheld.
its
validity
was
sustained.
and
incidentally,
it
concerned
anarchist,
people
intending
to
overthrow
the
government,
which
takes
us
back
to
the
comment
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
in
this
case.
but
in
the
gitlow
case,
the
--
this
court
said,
in
substance
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
state
is
acting
arbitrarily
or
unreasonable
when
in
the
exercise
of
its
judgment
as
to
measures
necessary
to
the
public
peace
and
safety,
it
seeks
to
extinguish
the
spark,
extinguish
it
before
it
has
enkindled
the
flame
or
blazed
into
conflagration.
what
do
they
mean?
they
mean
what
we're
trying
to
do
here,
we
have
a
problem.
now,
if
this
was
a
pollyanna
type
movie,
as
mr.
bilgrey
has
intimated,
then
first
of
all,
he
is
committed
to
fraud
upon
this
court
in
going
through
this
procedure.
i'm
assuming
this
is
a
type
of
a
movie
that
we
would
reject
and
that's
the
reason
he
would
not
bring
it
into
us.
the
movie
industry
is
not
here
today
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
freedom
of
speech
of
the
individuals
of
this
country,
that
maybe
the
result
if
you
agree
with
them.
they
are
here
today
for
the
right
to
exhibit
a
movie
called
"don
juan".
that's
what
they
want.
and
more
importantly,
they
want
the
right.
if
you
agree
with
them
in
the
future
to
exhibit
any
--
anyway,
pornographic
or
other
one,
there
is
great
profit
in
movies
which
are
obscene
or
pornographic.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
and
the
movie
industry,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
condemn
the
industry.
god,
the
america
needs
that
industry.
it's
a
great
industry
but
there
are
people
in
the
industry
as
there
are
in
every
business
who
maybe
attempting
to
force
upon
the
public
obscene,
pornographic
movies.
we
know
that
--
that
there
are
pornographic
pictures
around
that
are
surreptitiously
handed
from
man
then
sold.
there's
a
great
profit
in
it.
and
that
is
what
we're
fearful
of
here.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
consider
it
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
extremely
unlikely,
justice
stewart.
however,
if
they
did
not
have
the
responsibility
of
submitting
a
movie
to
the
police
chief,
they
might
attempt
to
exhibit
it.
that's
the
reason
that
they're
here,
is
to
avoid
the
exhibiting.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
of
course,
but
that,
justice
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
douglas
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
justice
douglas,
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
harder
role.
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
showing
of
obscene
pictures
or
pornographic
pictures
or
pictures
which
lead
to
riots
or
breaches
of
the
peace
is
to
protect
the
public
and
if
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
but
we
are
--
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
the
court
has
said
that
many
times
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
but
my
saying
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
certainly
do
not,
sir.
i
think
that
the
chicago
tribune,
of
course,
is
a
great
paper.
it
happens
to
be
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
any
paper.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
any
paper.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
of
course
not,
but
i've
attempted
to
say
that
the
court
did,
in
my
judgment
and
in
the
judgment
of
the
legislator,
the
--
the
men
who
enacted
this
ordinance.
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
a
movie
and
a
newspaper.
their
ultimate
objective
first
of
all,
one,
is
to
disseminate
news,
which
you
read
in
the
privacy
of
your
home.
the
other
primarily
is
entertainment.
i
know
--
i
know
that
the
court
has
--
has
indicated
in
some
of
its
statements
that
there's
probably
no
difference
between
entertainment
and
--
and
the
dissemination
of
news
by
a
newspaper.
and
i
respect
your
convictions
there,
justice
douglas,
and
i'm
sure
you
respect
mine
whether
or
not,
we're
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
don't
think
it's
restricted,
i
--
it's
--
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
think
it
does.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
think
it
does.
certainly
it
does.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
true.
but
we
are
not
--
many
people
in
close
proximity
in
a
darkened
theatre
for
several
hours
at
a
time.
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
legislative
judgment
of
the
counsel
of
our
city
in
--
in
anticipating
that
problem
and
in
trying
to
do
something
about
it,
is
what
we're
talking
about
here.
we're
talking
about
an
obscene
movie.
we're
not
talking
about
one
that
--
that
is
harmless.
and
that
is
what
the
--
that
is
what
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
they
want
us
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
because
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
doubt
it
because
it's
not
constitutionally
proper.
of
course,
we
have
no
ordinance.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes,
as
respect
to
movies
but
not
as
respect
to
newspaper.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
presumption
of
what,
sir?
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
if
it
were
not
pornography,
justice
douglas,
they
would
not
have
--
they
would
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
true.
if
that
is
their
purpose
here,
it
may
well
be.
i
do
not
know,
sir.
however,
even
--
let
me
say
that
there
are
circumstances,
disregarding
for
a
moment
the
issue
here,
there
are
circumstances
under
which
justice
douglas,
you
believe
that
prior
restraint
would
be
possible
or
i
--
i
think
in
one
of
the
recent
opinions
in
a
--
you
made
a
comment
joined
in
by
justice
black.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i'm
looking
for
it,
sir.
there
was
an
inference.
i
think
in
the
kingsley
pictures
case
that
under
--
under
certain
conditions,
a
type
of
prior
restraint
might
be
--
might
be
proper.
i'm
referring
now,
justice
douglas,
to
a
statement
that
you
made.
perhaps,
i'm
interpreting
it
wrongfully.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
it
--
in
that
case
--
in
that
case,
i
would
like
to
specifically
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
find
it.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
i'm
going
to
find
it
here
so
that
i
can
be
sure
exactly
what
it
said.
i'm
going
to
have
the
smallest
amount.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
certainly
do
not
want
to
get
it
into
the
--
justice
douglas,
i'm
now
referring
to
kingsley
pictures,
360
united
states
at
page
698.
i
know,
of
course,
justice
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
will,
sir.
i
will
and
i
know
that
you
will
disagree
with
my
interpretation
of
it
but
i'd
like
you
to
know
what
it
says.
698.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
justice
douglas,
different
questions
may
arise
as
to
censorship
of
some
news.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
some
news.
when
the
nation
is
actually
at
war
but
any
possible
exceptions
are
extremely
limited
in
my
opinion.
mr.
justice
douglas,
you
are
there
intimating
that
there
maybe
conditions
under
which
a
form
of
prior
restraint
would
be
possible.
now,
that's
my
interpretation
of
your
word,
i
maybe
in
error.
every
--
every
great
pronouncement
of
this
court
and
let
us
--
let
us
take
near
versus
minnesota.
and
you,
justice
douglas,
have
relied
upon
that
also.
you
have
--
you
have
felt
as
we
all
do
that
it
established
a
great
principle.
in
near
versus
minnesota,
which
as
we
know
struck
down
subsequent
publication
because
prior
publications
had
been
found
offensive
and
therefore,
the
court
would
not
tolerate
it.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no.
that
is
what
i'm
coming
to,
justice
whittaker.
it
said,
of
course,
by
a
way
of
dictum
but
we
must
rely
upon
that
in
dealing
with
the
court.
every
time
you
say
a
word
here,
all
over
this
nation
and
perhaps
all
over
the
world,
we
lawyers
(inaudible).
we
want
to
use
it
for
some
purpose.
you
know
that.
in
the
near
versus
minnesota
case,
after
--
after
talking
about
a
nation
being
at
war
and
after
saying
that
in
that
case,
it
is
conceivable
that
there
might
be
some
form
of
prior
restraint.
the
court
went
on
to
say
and
we've
quoted
it
time
and
again
here.
you
know
what
it
said
on
similar
grounds.
they
were
talking
about
a
nation
at
war."
on
similar
grounds,
the
primary
requirements
of
decency
maybe
enforced
against
obscene
publications."
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
that.
justice
douglas
asked
me,
may
you
not
prosecute
them
after
the
publication
has
been
made
of
court?
but
we
feel
that
the
--
the
damages
then
done.
we
feel
that
we're
the
--
the
punishment
of
the
exhibitor
doesn't
solve
the
problem
at
all.
we
feel
that
we're
an
obscene
pornographic
movie
has
been
shown
to
hundreds
of
people
in
a
darkened
theatre
that
the
possible
damages
or
a
movie
that
might
lead
to
riots
or
breaches
of
the
peace,
the
damage
is
done.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
undoubtedly,
justice
douglas,
but
we
have
no
such
ordinance
on
that.
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
valid.
i
think
that
the
difference
between
a
movie
and
a
publication
of
that
nature
must
be
recognized
by
the
judiciary,
i
hope,
because
the
legislature
feels
there
is
one
and
we'd
--
we
do
not
make
law
deliberately
to
violate
the
constitution,
of
course.
we
--
we
make
them
to
meet
a
problem.
and
there
are
many
times
when
in
meeting
that
problem,
we
deprive
people
of
their
constitutional
rights.
that's
where
you
come
in
and
you
tell
us
you
have
to
do
it
differently
and
we
do.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
the
ordinance
provides
for
an
appeal
to
the
mayor.
and
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes
and
the
stipulated
facts
here
show
that
that
administrative
procedure
was
followed.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
and
then
in
--
of
the
courts.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
and
of
the
courts.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
as
much
as
it
means
to
the
police
commissioner,
there
are
many
--
many
movies
exhibited
in
our
city
and
in
many
city.
and
i've
--
i'm
sure
that
--
that
they
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
the
mayor.
the
mayor
makes
the
decision.
the
mayor
forwards
his
decision
to
the
petitioner
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
under
the
ordinance,
yes.
and
the
police
commissioner
is
charged
with
the
original
responsibility,
and
from
there
to
the
court.
and
the
--
the
--
although
it
is
not
an
issue
here,
the
state
of
illinois
has
a
statute
that
empowers
municipalities
to
enact
ordinances
of
this
type
which
will
permit
them
the
license
or
regulate
or
tax
or
even
prohibit
motion
picture
or
theatrical.
that
statute
is
not
here
involved.
it
is
not
challenged
by
the
petitioner
but
it
was
pursuant
to
that
statute.
that
this
ordinance
was
passed
over
50
years
ago
in
the
city
of
chicago
and
it
is
--
it
administered
without
any
difficulty,
i
should
say
with
very
little
difficulty,
for
over
50
years.
the
--
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
burstyn
case,
i'm
sure
affecting
many
communities
as
it
did
in
chicago.
we
were
not
certain
what
we
knew
what
the
court
meant
there,
but
we
were
not
certain
whether
that
doctrine
would
be
extended.
we
knew
in
the
burstyn
case
and
in
subsequent
cases
that
the
language
employed
and
the
new
york
statute
was
found
to
be
offensive
here
and
called
it
was
vague
and
indefinite
and
that
they
employed
standards
that
could
not
properly
be
invoked
in
enforcement.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct,
justice
whittaker.
that
is
what
they
seek.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
and
in
that
regard,
justice
whittaker,
we
have
another
point.
and
it
would
come
to
a
little
later
in
the
argument
which
was
the
basis
of
the
decisions
in
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
my
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
my
understanding
of
our
position,
justice
whittaker
--
justice
frankfurter
although,
i
will
permit
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
to
answer
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
that's
my
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
understanding
of
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
my
understanding
of
the
issue
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
--
that
i
do
not
know,
justice
whittaker.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
i
do
not
know.
it
is
not
been
raised
in
this
case.
however,
we
have
criminal
law,
of
course,
as
counsel
has
contended,
prohibiting
the
exhibition
of
--
of
obscene
material
and
i
would
see
no
reason
why
prosecution
could
not
be
made
if,
even
though
a
permit
had
issued,
although
it
certainly
would
complicate
the
prosecution
and
make
it
difficult.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
oh,
no.
no
--
the
--
however,
the
--
the
obscene
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
the
statute
is
a
--
is
a
state
law
which
would
be
prosecuted
by
a
different
agency
and
then
the
city.
however,
i
--
i
would
assume
that
the
prosecution
would
be
hampered
to
such
a
degree
that
it
would
be
silly
to
file
the
--
to
bring
the
preceding
because
they
would
say,
"you
allowed
us
to
exhibit
this
movie,
here's
the
permit."
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
accept
your
correction,
justice
black,
of
course,
they
could
not
--
did
not
hamper.
they
would
not
bring
it
all.
they
could
not
do
so.
but
if
--
because
there
is
no
answer
in
the
ordinance
itself
to
the
question,
i
suppose
it's
conceivable
that
they
might
try
it,
could
not
succeed
in
law.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
see
no
prohibition
in
the
statute.
it's
unlikely
that
it
would
be
done.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
of
the
ordinance
that
would
prohibit
such
a
thing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
of
course,
the
complaint,
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
we
have
a
system
that
requires
a
certain
municipal
official
to
inspect
all
movies.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
and
--
and
i'm
coming
to
that.
he
--
it
is
his
duty
under
the
ordinance
to
issue
a
permit
for
the
public
exhibition
of
that
movie
unless
he
finds
that
the
movie
is
obscene,
if
it
would
lead
to
a
riot
or
a
breach
of
the
peace
or
certain
other
things
that
are
contained
in
the
ordinance.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
of
course,
justice
black,
we
must
go
back
to
what
we
consider
as
the
basic
difference
between
a
movie
and
a
publication.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i'm
not
backing
away
from
the
issue
here
at
all.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
certainly
do.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
right
for
newspapers.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
this
court
has
made
such
a
pronouncement.
in
my
judgment,
i'm
giving
you
my
opinion.
you
could
not
--
we
could
not
do
it.
now
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
over
50
years
of
age,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
we
do
not
prosecute,
sir.
there
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
we
do
not
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
there's
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
justice
frankfurter.
and
i
--
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
petitioner
of
this
case,
if
he
feels
as
strongly
as
he
don't,
instead
of
following
this
procedure,
leaving
us
in
the
dark,
could
publicly
exhibit
this
movie
without
a
permit.
and
of
course,
we
would
have
to
prosecute
or
abandon
our
order.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
we
can
prosecute
for
exhibiting
a
movie
without
a
permit.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
the
ordinance
provides
that
you
must
have
a
permit
and
if
you
don't,
you
will
be
fined.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
so
that
if
you
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
exhibit
it
without
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
the
--
the
nature
of
the
--
i
would
--
it's
an
ordinance,
so
that
it's
--
i
think
the
maximum
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
maximum
fine
was
$200,
i
believe.
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
--
the
only
way
that
defense
could
properly
be
raised,
sir,
is
to
say
that
we
do
not
have
the
right,
the
constitutional
right
to
require,
of
course,
the
--
whether
or
not
the
picture
is
obscene
is
always
an
issue
in
all
of
these
cases.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
certainly.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it
would,
i'm
sure,
be
a
defense
in
a
certain
way.
it
would
not
--
it
would
not
meet
the
other
requirements
of
the
ordinance,
that
is,
i
think,
that
the
$25
fee
or
something.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
but
they
are,
of
course,
conceding
they're
willing
to
pay
that.
that's
not
the
issue
here.
but
you
were
--
it
--
it
might
be
a
defense.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
right.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
true.
and
--
and
he
would
not
be
able
to
avoid
the
--
the
payment
of
the
fee
for
a
permit
by
going
in
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
because
he
--
because
he
is
required
to
do
this
under
the
ordinance.
the
nature
of
the
film
there
will
not
be
material.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
and
of
course,
you
have
done
that,
justice
douglas,
as
you
know
and
it's
--
it's
proper.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
understand,
justice
whittaker.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
do
not
know,
sir.
i'm
sorry,
justice
frankfurter,
it
has
never
been
an
issue
in
any
of
our
proceedings.
it
--
i
assume
would
say
that
you're
entitled
to
exhibit
a
--
the
issue
with
permit
naming
the
movie
to
a
certain
exhibitor
and
he
has
the
right
to
transfer
that
under
the
ordinance
to
other
exhibitors.
that's
all
i
know
about
it.
i
have
never
seen
anything.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
never
to
my
knowledge,
sir,
has
anyone
attempted
that.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
say
that,
sir,
because
where
we
have
denied
a
permit
in
illinois,
the
--
they
have
gone
to
the
courts
and
the
--
and
there
attacked
the
validity
of
the
ordinance
and
the
illinois
courts
have
sustained
it.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
if
--
if
i
said
that,
i
misunderstood
justice
frankfurter.
yes,
our
courts
have
tested
this
ordinance
and
have
been
hereon
at
once.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
sustain
the
ordinance.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
through
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
lower
court
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
precisely.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
precisely.
and
in
--
in
those
--
in
those
cases
as
here
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
they
claimed
two
things
as
they
do
here.
first,
that
the
movie
did
not
offend
as
the
city
said
it
did.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes,
yes
and
secondly
that
the
ordinance
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
what
they
say
here,
of
course,
in
the
other
cases,
justice
frankfurter,
they
also
attacked
the
constitutionality.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
they
said
we
could
not
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
in
the
other
cases
after
the
court
--
the
court
considered
whether
or
not
the
movie
was
obscene
and
whether
or
not
it
was
constitutional
and
having
arrived
at
the
conclusion
in
the
other
cases
that
it
was
obscene,
therefore,
it
was
required
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
ordinance
was
constitutional
and
it
upheld
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
whether
they
needed
a
permit.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
he
says
we
have
no
constitutional
right
to
require
the
exhibition
of
the
film.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
but
they
want
the
permit.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
the
court
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
in
--
in
at
least
one
of
the
case,
they
contended
that
it
was
unconstitutional
because
it
abridged
the
freedom
of
speech
and
the
press
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
and
the
illinois
court
passed
on
them.
of
course,
the
earlier
cases,
justice
black,
were
before
your
pronouncements
here,
were
before
the
--
i
think
the
first
case
was
before
the
mutual
of
ohio
case.
so
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
say
that
the
illinois
courts
have
held
that
this
ordinance
is
constitutionally
valid.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
against
the
attacks
made
in
those
cases.
now,
justice
black,
i
am
not
certain.
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
thought
the
attack
was
the
same
as
here,
but
i
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
of
course,
this
attack,
this
precise
attack,
i
don't
believe
was
before
the
illinois
court
because
this
precise
attack
--
he
wants
a
permit
without
bringing
in
the
movie.
that
was
not
the
case
before.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
that
is
true.
that
is
what
he
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--
alleges
here.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
i'm
not
arguing
that,
sir.
this
--
i'm
arguing
that
this
ordinance
is
valid.
that
we
have
a
right
to
require
it
to
be
exhibited
to
us
privately
before
it
can
be
exhibited
in
chicago.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
well,
i
--
i
cannot
--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
--
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
conceive,
justice
frankfurter,
of
a
permit
being
issued
but
denying
the
right
to
exhibit.
i
--
such
a
situation
has
never
existed.
if
we
issue
a
permit,
it
is
to
exhibit.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
have
not
raised
that
point.
i
would
like
my
associate
in
addressing
the
court
very
briefly
on
the
question
of
a
justiciable
controversy
here
and
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
a
substantial
type
of
question.
we
are
convinced
that
the
city
is
very
much
in
need
of
the
protection
of
this
ordinance.we
respectfully
asked
the
court
to
(inaudible)
it.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
oh,
yes.
all
applications
due
before
they
can
get
to
the
courts.
they
would
fail
to
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies.
they
did
not
do
that
and
the
mayor
acted.
thank
you
very
much.
