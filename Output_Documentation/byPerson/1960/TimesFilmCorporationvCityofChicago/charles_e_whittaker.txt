charles

whittaker
it
--
it
isn't,
it's
just
not
known,
(voice
overlap).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
entitled
then
to
sue
(inaudible)
that
this
is
hardcore
pornography?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
refused
to.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
we
have
--
have
you
any
right
to
assume
you
have
basis
for
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
(inaudible)
still
was
no
right
to
the
city
of
chicago
to
require
a
license.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
are
you
saying
that
motion
picture
would
not
be
obscene?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
would
you
know
that
it's
obscene?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
all
it
did
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
collins,
do
i
correctly
understand
that
this
is
not
a
suit
for
a
declaration
that
no
permit
is
required
but
is
a
suit
to
require
the
issuance
of
a
permit
without
production
of
the
film?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
the
suit
to
require
the
issuance
of
a
permit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
without
production
of
film?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
would
it
follow
if
i
may
ask
to,
if
they
had
the
permit,
they
could
not
then
subsequently
be
criminally
punished
for
its
--
the
showing
of
the
picture,
if
they
had
this
permit?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
sure
the
city
couldn't
do
it.
the
city
could
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
may
i
ask
you
not
to
mention
please,
mr.
collins,
though
probably
the
question
isn't
squarely
here.
would
it
be
a
defense
in
such
a
prosecution
to
show
that
the
picture
was
not
obscene?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
speak
what
is
not
obscene,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
would
it
therefore
be
a
defense
under
the
constitution,
in
that
prosecution
to
show
that
in
truth,
this
publication
was
not
obscene?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
why
i
asked
the
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
this,
sir?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
aren't
you
asking
for
a
permit
to
show
this
picture
whether
or
not
it
is
obscene?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
i'm
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(voice
overlap)
cases
here
i'm
asking
you
by
this
very
suit.
you
aren't
asking
the
court
to
direct
the
city
to
issue
a
license
to
show
this
film
whether
or
not
it's
obscene.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
there
a
reason
to
assume
that
it
is
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
this.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
we
were
to
grant
the
relief
you
(inaudible)
and
that
became
the
law,
then
would
it
not
follow
that
every
motion
picture
exhibitor
could
show
any
picture
however
obscene
without
any
ability
of
--
upon
--
the
parts
of
the
municipality
to
stop
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
then
are
you
saying
that
the
remedy
is
a
criminal
punishment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
there
is
no
other
power
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
enjoin
obscenity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
done
by
due
process
now?
