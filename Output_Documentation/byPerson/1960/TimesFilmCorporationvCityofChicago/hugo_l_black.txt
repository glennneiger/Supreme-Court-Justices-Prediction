justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
question
the
one
you've
presented
in
your
petition
especially
granted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
claiming
i
suppose
whether
right
or
you're
wrong.
there
is
no
complication
to
arise,
that
exercise
of
power
of
censorship
on
motion
pictures
for
than
in
a
permit.
it's
been
held
it
could
not
be
done
on
publication
for
amusement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
seems
to
be
the
question
you've
presented.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
we
have
to
presume
either
way
on
the
legal
question
you've
presented?
i
don't
know
why.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
wouldn't
be
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
wouldn't
be
a
presumption,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
what
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sure
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sure
if
you
say
i
agreed
to
it.
i
misjudged
him
perfectly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
will
you
read
it
if
you
have
it
there
before
you,
the
senate.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i'd
like
to
know
what's
your
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
hampered?
is
that
is
not
--
as
long
as
you
can
get
the
word,
you
mean
that
the
state
can
set
up
a
system
and
tell
people
they
can
do
something
with
the
authority
of
the
law
and
then
go
ahead,
prosecute
a
criminal
from
doing
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
would
try?
you
mean
the
public
officials
going
to
try
to
prosecute
somebody
for
a
crime,
when
the
state
has
set
up
machinery
and
said
you
can
do
this,
it
doesn't
violate
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
it'd
be
a
prohibition
to
say
that
we
are
setting
just
the
state
to
its
legislature
that
gives
you
authority
to
do
this.
we're
not
going
to
give
you
authority
of
course
to
break
the
law
but
we're
giving
you
authority
to
do
this
or
it's
not
breaking
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
license
system.
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
a
license
system,
whether
good
or
bad,
whether
constitutional
or
not,
what
you
have
is
a
system
of
licensing
for
moving
pictures.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
written
in
the
form
--
use
the
word
"license"
and
was
a
book.
it's
not
final
in
this
case
of
course
because
of
the
difference
between
the
book
and
the
movie.
what
if
it
was
with
reference
to
book,
you
had
that
exact
law,
what
would
be
the
difference
between
intervening
this
licensing
law
for
printed
--
for
printing
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that.
i
--
i
understand
that.
but
that's
what
--
that's
what
your
issue
is,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
concede
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
concede
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so
far
as
the
books
are
concerned,
they
couldn't
do
it
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
knew
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
be?
you
got
an
ordinance
there
that
said
it's
against
the
law
to
show
a
movie
without
a
license,
would
that
affirm
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
make
out
of
crime,
if
you
--
if
you
call
the
violation
an
ordinance
of
the
crime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
can't
defend
by
coming
in
and
saying,
"well,
i
would
have
a
right
to
show
it
if
i'd
take
it
to
the
licensee."
his
--
his
offense
is
showing
it
without
a
permit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
permit
well,
he
could
--
could
he
have
guard
the
payment
of
the
fine,
if
he
got
it
without
a
license?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
movie
people
have
not
been
violating
the
ordinance.
they've
been
joined
to
union
license
or
permit.
so
you
had
no
cases
to
prosecute
him
for
showing
without
a
permit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
was
--
that
was
also
involved
in
the
other
cases
after
the
--
as
i
understood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
is
one
of
the
things
the
court
passed
on
in
the
state
cases,
as
i
understood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
do
is
--
what
they
do
is
to
challenge
it
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
it
requires
a
prior
censorship
of
the
movie.that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
passed
on
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
presenting
that
as
the
reason
why
the
--
we
should
send
it
back
to
the
--
of
the
state
supreme
court
to
pass
on
whether
or
not
this
constitutional
objection
is
valid
or
do
you
say
they've
were
already
passed
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
against
this
attack
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i
want
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what
i
want
to
get
at
is,
if
you're
raising
the
question
that
in
some
way,
the
state
of
illinois
had
them
sustained
constitutionality
of
the
act
against
this
attack.
are
you
raising
that
question
or
is
--
is
that
a
raisable
question
do
you
think?
is
it
--
is
it
a
reasonable
ground
to
believe
that
they
would
hold
that
this
attack
is
a
valid
one
constitutionally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
wants
--
he
does
it
--
but
that's
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
because
it
requires
a
prior
censorship.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
are
you
saying
that
the
state
hadn't
passed
on
that,
so
it'd
be
advisable
for
us
to
send
it
back,
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he's
predetermined
it
or
he's
raised
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he
has
predetermined
it
or
he
has
raised
it
good?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that
argument.
you
mean
in
order
to
raise
the
question
of
whether
the
act
is
unconstitutional
in
requiring
him
to
present
it,
he
must
present
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
otherwise,
he
can't
raise
the
question,
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
they
--
if
they
decide
it's
not
pornographic,
he's
not
harmed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
made
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
they
hadn't
made
it
(inaudible).
you
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
then
the
first
act
of
the
expert
on
determining
whether
this
picture
had
in
effect
upon
the
query
of
mind
before
they
let
the
experts
in
the
city
of
chicago
passed
on
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
would
--
they
--
they
had
planned
to
do
that.
that
would
amount
to
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
--
what's
the
reason
for
that
summary
of
disposition
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
it's
abstract
that
this
people
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
really
have
no
controversy
with
you
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
--
it
wind
up
--
it
wind
up
if
we
did
that,
wouldn't
it,
with
them
being
denied
the
right
to
show
the
picture
that
they're
showing
it
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
--
it
would
summarily
dispose
of
what
probably
--
usually
be
considered
a
controversy,
their
denial
that
you
have
a
right
to
demand
for
--
to
see
that
picture.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
are
you
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask,
just
--
perhaps,
you
--
you
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
answer
probably.
well,
i'm
wondering.
why
didn't
you
file
it
in
the
state
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
said
you
could.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
it's
been
long
delayed
longer
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
had
a
quicker
trial
in
the
federal
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
its
saying,
isn't
it,
that
it
--
it
can
be
shown
as
not
obscene?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
when
does
it
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
raised
--
you
raised
the
question
in
my
mind,
if
whether
you
have
any
case
at
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you'd
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
the
question
i
thought
you
had
up
and
i
seem
to
have
fully
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
based
on
a
misapprehension
that
you
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
are
you
raising
the
question
in
near
versus
minnesota?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
here,
this
ordinance
is
invalid.
you
don't
have
to
submit
it,
called
--
it's
a
form
of
prior
censorship
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
is
prohibited
by
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
have
presume
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
all
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
presumption
on
the
question
you
raised.
