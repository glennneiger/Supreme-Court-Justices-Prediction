mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
which
is
here
on
certiorari
presents
a
state
court
an
important
question,
whether
or
not
a
municipality
may
exclude
all
motion
pictures
for
public
view,
unless
and
until
they
have
been
first
submitted
to
a
censor
for
the
examination
and
censorship
of
their
contents.
the
facts
are
as
follows,
the
petitioner
is
engaged
in
the
business
of
releasing
motion
pictures
nationally.
it
has
the
exclusive
right
to
license
in
the
city
of
chicago
a
motion
picture
entitled
“don
juan.”
we
applied
to
the
commissioner
of
police
who
pursuant
to
the
ordinance
is
to
censor
for
a
permit
pursuant
to
the
ordinance.
we
completed
the
application
and
the
application
was
then
tendered
to
the
police
commissioner
with
the
licensing
fee
and
the
police
commissioner
refused
the
application
on
the
sole
ground
that
the
motion
picture
itself
had
not
been
submitted
for
censorship.
we
then
repeated
the
application
to
the
mayor
because
the
ordinance
provides
that
in
case
of
a
denial
of
a
permit,
the
application
may
again
be
made
to
the
mayor
and
we
again
make
--
made
the
application
for
this
motion
picture.
we've
tendered
the
licensing
fee
and
we
again
refused
to
submit
the
motion
picture,
and
the
license
was
denied
exclusively
on
that
particular
ground.
we
then
filed
a
complaint
in
the
federal
district
court
and
we
alleged
diversity
of
citizenship
because
the
petitioners
in
new
york
concerned
and
we
also
alleged
that
the
action
arises
pursuant
to
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments
and
we
also
allege
that
the
damages
exceed
the
amount
of
$10,000.
now
all
these
facts
are
admitted
by
the
respondents.
there's
no
question
about
facts,
and
the
respondents
have
further
admitted
and
stipulated
that
we
are
prohibited
from
showing
this
motion
picture
in
the
city
of
chicago
publicly
under
the
penalties
and
prosecution
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
ordinance.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
yes,
it
was
your
honor.
that's
part
of
the
complaint.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
the
character
of
the
motion
picture
is
not
involved
in
this
case
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
it's
not
--
it's
not
known.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
it's
just
not
known.
the
only
thing
which
is
involved
is
the
title
which
is
a
part
of
the
application.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
that
is
an
assumption,
which
the
respondents
have
now
indulged
in
their
brief
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
that
we
can
assume
in
the
--
in
that.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
because
the
sole
reason
that
the
permit
was
denied
was
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
motion
picture
had
not
been
presented.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
we
maintain
that
the
--
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
further
answer
that
question,
we
maintain
that
the
respondents
have
no
initial
right
to
know
the
contents
of
our
particular
communication.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
suppose
that
the
--
you
do
your
honors
but
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
all
these
assumptions
are
correct,
that
we
still
are
entitled
to
initially
present
the
communication.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
i
may
further
answer
that
--
the
question
mr.
justice,
there
was
--
there
have
been
a
case
--
cases
recently
in
new
york
where
the
counsel
for
both
parties
agreed
and
stipulated
to
that
the
motion
picture
is
obscene
and
the
appellant,
the
division
did
not
agree
and
what
--
did
not
have
to
abide
by
that
stipulation.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
is
our
position.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
of
our
position
and
i
would
--
if
i
may
mr.
justice
come
to
that
and
--
when
we
reach
the
issue
is
that
--
that
one
of
the
considerations
that
this
court
i
guess
has
always
made
and
always
will
make
is
how
--
will
the
state
be
left
in
utter
confusion
here
if
--
if
a
statute
is
struck
down
and
set
aside
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
are
sufficient
other
remedies.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
that
--
that
is
right
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
amplify
and
add
to
--
to
that
question.
we
have
a
lot
of
the
previous
litigation
as
our
--
at
the
appendix
in
our
petition
for
a
cert
--
for
certiorari
shows
with
--
with
these
same
respondents
and
i
think
that
if
that
previous
litigation
shows
anything
at
all
is
that
no
pictures
that
we
have
ever
submitted
and
nor
anyone
else
that
we
ever
know
of
to
this
particular
board
has
in
fact
been
pornographic.
and
i
would
venture
a
speculation
that
no
one
would
ever
submit
such
a
picture
to
a
board
to
begin
with.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
they
didn't
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
--
that
seems
to
be
the
general
experience
mr.
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
no.
we
are
not
raising
an
abstract
legal
question
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
think
the
--
the
--
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
answer
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
the
question
here
is
whether
we've
set
forth
the
cause
of
action.
we
are
--
we
are
in
business
for
profit
and
of
course
that
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
but
the
--
i
--
we
--
the
--
the
question
you
were
raising
i
believe
is
whether
we've
set
forth
a
--
an
adequate
cause
of
action.
but
i
think
we
have.
we
have
applied
for
a
permit
pursuant
to
the
ordinance.
we
didn't
hide
anything.
we
tendered
the
licensing
fee
and
we're
willing
not
to
dispute
that.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
that's
our
legal
position.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
the
--
the
question
--
the
one
that's
presented
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
--
that
is
our
main
contention
mr.
justice
black
and
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
and
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
--
and
the
--
the
--
that
the
--
that
question
has
been
before
this
court
on
previous
occasions
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
doubt
in
the
minds
of
anyone
even
in
the
minds
of
the
respondents
that
--
that
is
the
position
which
the
first
amendment
in
which
this
court
has
taken
with
regard
to
every
other
single
form
of
expression
in
the
past.
and
i
think
that
the
way
i
read
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
burstyn
case
that
--
that
the
motion
pictures
have
clearly
been
held
to
be
a
form
of
speech
that
fall
within
the
prospect
--
protective
scope
of
the
first
amend
--
in
the
fourteenth
amendments.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
believe
that
this
court
in
--
in
burstyn
has
held
that
there
can
be
a
regulatory
scheme
so
long
as
the
regulatory
scheme
does
not
take
the
form
of
the
previous
licensing
and
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
burstyn
was
confined
to
the
particular
standard,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
this
court
has
consistently
struck
down
every
single
standard
and
has
reversed
every
single
ban
since
burstyn
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
the
proposition
was
never
before
the
court
in
this
particular
fashion
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
understand
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
the
way
i
read
your
opinion
in
the
co
--
in
the
kingsley
books
case,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
those
are
your
views
as
well
that
the
--
that
the
state
has
plenty
of
regulatory
schemes
at
its
command.
and
in
fact,
this
court
has
held
in
the
kingsley
books
case
that
they
limited
injunctive
remedy.
it
must
be
upheld
where
the
state
of
new
york
enacted
it
in
order
to
prevent
the
obscenity
and
other
undesirable
conduct.
but
i
think
that
the
view
was
stressed
in
kingsley
books
again
that
the
remedy
must
be
closely
confined
and
so
as
to
preclude
what
is
commonly
known
as
licensing
or
censorship.
and
i
think
that
the
court
referred
to
the
word
licensing
there
as
a
discretionary
license
because
we're
willing
to
waive
the
licensing
fee.
we
don't
particularly
care
about
that.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
don't
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
have
--
i
have
ordinance
in
front
of
me
here
and
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
and
the
--
and
the
--
well,
it's
defined
as
a
--
as
a
--
if
any
arcades
--
well,
this
is
a
very
old
ordinance,
i
think
its
50
years
old.
and
in
all
of
the
automatic
or
motion
picture
devices
and
i
imagined
that
applies
to
theatres.
but
i
would
like
to
point
--
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
the
statute
is
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
record
at
page
9.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
may
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
that
this
ordinance
is
indeed
censorship
in
its
purest
state
and
form.
and
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
repeat
here
the
arguments
which
i
believe
every
justice
of
this
court
has
made.
and
i
think
that
the
sole
distinction
that
some
of
the
justices
of
the
court
had
made
with
regard
to
a
particular
form
of
restraint,
is
that
they
did
not
consider
that
form
of
restraint
prior
censorship.
but
here,
the
ordinance
spells
it
out.
the
ordinance,
if
i
may
refer
to
it
states
--
specifically
states,
and
that
is
section
155-4
that
every
motion
picture
shall
be
submitted
for
censorship
of
its
contents.
i
don't
think
that
there
can
be
any
question
here
that
this
is
indeed
the
type
of
censorship
that
the
first
amendment
was
enacted
against.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
in
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
expand
on
that,
that
we
--
we
are
saying
that
to
a
certain
degree,
that
we
are
not
suggesting
what
remedies
the
state
can
have.
the
state
in
effect
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
believe
that
that
is
a
correct
statement
mr.
justice
harlan.
we
--
we
are
here
to
allege
that
the
very
least
that
the
first
amendment
stands
for
and
as
--
is
made
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
is
to
provide
for
freedom
from
previous
restraints
and
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
that
the
respondents
here
have
been
in
business
to
know
what
this
particular
motion
picture
may
contain.
it
may
be
pornographic,
it
may
be
pollyanna,
it
may
be
mozart.
the
fact
is
that
we
would
be
prosecuted
and
the
respondents
have
so
admitted,
if
we
were
to
show
this
movie
in
violation
of
the
ordinance,
merely
for
failure
to
have
a
permit.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
--
that
is
the
contention
of
the
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
harlan,
but
we
don't
agree
with
that
and
in
fact
we
don't
understand
it
because
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
you
--
you
understand
the
--
certainly
understand
the
contention
of
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
we
understand
that
that
is
their
contention
but
we
certainly
don't
agree
with
it.
in
fact,
every
single
motion
picture
case,
which
has
been
before
this
court,
has
been
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
this
case.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
--
that
is
their
contention.
but
--
but
we
--
we
are
--
our
position
is
that
we
--
we
have
applied
for
a
license.
and
in
fact,
if
we
had
shown
the
motion
picture
without
a
license,
the
--
the
respondents
would
then
have
contended
that
we
would
have
had
to
challenge
the
entire
ordinance
which
we
were
not
willing
to
do.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
the
--
that
--
that
is
right
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
this
court
has
been
very
careful
not
to
prejudice
this
particular
question
as
to
whether
the
prior
restraint
itself
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
will
be
tolerated.
yes
--
yes,
you're
--
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
course.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
is
right
there
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
that
is
the
correct
appraisal
of
the
issue
as
of
now.
but
we
would
like
to
add
if
we
may,
if
we
maybe
permitted
to
do
so
that
the
--
the
illinois
state
supreme
court
has
not
taken
that
view
and
that
it
has
interpreted
this
court's
holding
in
burstyn
to
countenance
censorship
because
it
has
--
and
it
has
construed
this
ordinance
to
--
to
permit
censorship
of
motion
pictures.
and
in
fact
that
the
--
what
the
only
word
that
we
think
as
i
propose
to
use
is
that
it
has
distorted
near
against
minnesota
to
such
an
extent
that
if
this
court
were
to
accept
that
position,
the
first
amendment
would
no
longer
be
the
first
amendment.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no,
it
was
not
your
honor.
but
this
court
referred
to
it
in
the
burstyn
case.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
that
that
--
that
is
--
that
is
right
mr.
justice
stewart
that
that
is
one
form
of
censorship
but
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that's
the
near
case.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
yes.
but
they're
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
this
is
an
even
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
this
is
an
even
clearer
case
of
censorship
because
the
city
presumes
and
in
fact,
it
presumes
that
every
motion
picture
meets
every
objection
within
the
ordinance.
in
fact,
they
put
the
shoe
in
the
other
foot
and
i
think
that
this
revolts
against
our
traditional
mode
of
justice
and
according
to
the
other
remedies
and
we
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
maybe
permitted
to
do
so
the
--
that
the
motion
picture
association
of
america
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
and
this
court
has
granted
the
motion
and
they
have
an
appendix
in
that
amicus
brief
which
shows
that
46
states
in
our
union
and
the
great
vast
majority
of
our
cities,
the
municipalities,
rely
on
our
traditional
judicial
processes.
and
that
i
think
that
these
points
out
what
the
mr.
justice
brandeis
once
referred
to
as
“the
judgment
of
mankind.”
i
think
that
it
shows
that
our
traditional
judicial
mode
of
dealing
with
the
--
with
that
which
maybe
rejected
is
not
lost
and
that
the
state
would
not
be
left
in
any
confusion.
in
fact,
illinois
has
a
penal
code
and
in
fact
the
--
this
may
not
be
too
pertinent
from
a
constitutional
viewpoint
but
we
noticed
that
the
ordinance
does
not
provide
for
immunity
from
the
illinois
penal
code.
in
fact,
the
--
your
honors,
the
way
we
read
the
holding
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
they
are
remaking
the
first
amendment
all
over
again.
their
argument
is
that
the
motion
pictures
are
very
effective
and
--
and
that
therefore,
they
ought
to
be
censored.
well
its
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
we
--
we
hadn't
raised
that
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
we
--
we
--
that
may
certainly
be
an
issue
mr.
justice
stewart
but
we
hadn't
raised
the
self-incrimination
issue.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
the
--
the
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
the
--
the
argument
that
--
well,
the
argument
that
we
are
making
and
we're
perfectly
willing
to
show
this
picture
privately
to
the
respondents
if
they
care
to
see
it
instead.
the
argument
that
we
are
making
your
honors
is
that
even
if
motion
pictures
were
irresponsible
as
a
form
of
speech,
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
said
this
in
burstyn
and
repeated
it
in
kingsley
and
even
if
they
are
very
eloquent
as
a
form
of
speech,
then
they
still
are
entitled
to
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
protection.
and
i
think
that
we
appreciate
the
--
the
glamour
that
the
--
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
give
to
the
motion
picture
industry.
i
think
it's
been
long
since
lost
but
they
called
it
a
very
effective
medium.
i
think
the
industry
has
long
since
lost
that
glamour
to
television.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no,
your
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
implication
is
that
--
and
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
kingsley
pictures
case
that
even
if
it
is
most
eloquent,
it
still
is
entitled
to
the
first
amendment
protection
and
even
if
it
is
mostly
irresponsible
which
we
object
to
quite
strenuously.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
take
up
the
question
that
was
presented
--
posed
yesterday
as
to
whether
the
presumption
can
be
indulged
in
that
the
petitioner's
motion
picture,
"don
juan,"
is
obscene
or
whether
it
runs
afoul
any
or
all
of
the
other
standards
of
this
particular
ordinance
because
we
have
refused
to
submit
the
motion
picture
to
the
police
commissioner
in
chicago
for
censorship.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
we
have.
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
that
if
this
court
were
to
indulge
in
the
presumption
that
this
motion
picture
runs
afoul
the
standards
of
the
statute,
the
ordinance,
that
it
requires
the
indulgence
of
a
further
presumption,
namely
that
the
motion
picture
as
a
form
of
speech
is
an
evil
per
se.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
a
presumption
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
that
has
never
been
made.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
it
will
be
a
conclusion,
mr.
justice
black
that
has
never
been
made
with
regard
to
any
form
of
speech.
and
i
think
that
that
would
be
twisting
the
first
amendment.
i
think
that
the
very
least
that
the
first
amendment
stands
for
is
that
the
speech
is
innocent
and
this
is
the
blackstonean
concept
that
at
the
very
least
that
the
speech
may
be
initially
made
without
any
presumption
either
way
and
that
the
state
then
has
a
burden
and
that
is
a
heavy
burden
to
come
forth
and
to
prove
that
the
speech
does
not
have
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
protection.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
is
not
the
--
what
i
concede
this
question
to
be,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
that
if
we
were
to
concede
that
this
motion
picture
is
obscene,
whether
we
would
have
the
right
to
initially
show
it.
i
think
that
that
is
a
completely
different
question
which
--
i
don't
know
if
it
has
ever
been
decided
or
come
up
in
that
the
precise
posture.
i
think
the
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i'm
not.
i
think
that
there
maybe
obscene
motion
pictures
and
obscene
forms
of
speech.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
don't
think
you
would
know
it,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
but
it
is
our
contention
that
the
question
is
not
here
whether
we
would
have
the
right
to
initially
show
the
motion
picture
if
we
were
to
concede
that
introduction.
i
think
the
question
is
as
presented
in
our
petition
and
that
is
that
these
respondents
that
the
municipality
does
not
have
the
right
initially
to
require
the
submission
of
the
speech
and
i
don't
think
that
they
can
have
that
right
with
regard
to
any
form
of
communication.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
think
that
the
very
least
that
the
first
amendment
stands
for
is
that
everyone
has
the
right
to
initially
communicate
with
the
public
that
there
can
be
no
censors
wall.
and
if
--
if
i
may
amplify
that
answer,
i
think
that
the
kingsley
books
case
points
out
two
important
distinctions
between
that
--
the
--
the
statute
in
that
case
and
the
ordinance
in
this
case.
in
kingsley
books,
this
court
upheld
a
limited
injunctive
scheme,
whereby
the
state
can
enjoin
a
--
a
speech
or
book
and
afterwards,
determine
that
it
does
not
enjoin
the
first
amendment
protection.
i
think
that
the
first
distinction
to
be
made
is
that
new
york
did
not
require
that
every
speech
has
to
be
submitted
to
a
censor
first.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
mr.
justice
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no,
i
don't
conceive
that
to
be
the
question,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
conceive
the
question
as
formulated
in
our
petition,
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
require
the
prior
submission
to
a
censor
for
the
examination
of
contents
of
this
particular
speech.
and
i
think
that
no
court,
after
burstyn,
except
perhaps
for
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
below,
has
intimated
that
motion
pictures
are
not
a
form
of
speech.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
--
if
it
--
if
that
involves
a
concession
that
the
motion
--
that
this
motion
picture
is
obscene,
i
would
not
be
willing
to
concede
that.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
think
that
a
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
--
i
understand.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
presumption
can
be
made
or
conclusion
can
be
made
either
way
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
presumption
that
has
to
made
before
we
could
concede.
and
that's
why
i
don't
think
it's
--
that
that
is
the
question
that
whether
we
had
have
the
initial
right
to
show
this
motion
picture,
if
it
were
any
--
runs
--
to
run
afoul
of
any
of
the
statutory
standards.
i
don't
believe
that
question
is
before
the
court.
i
think
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
the
question
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
think
it
is.
that
--
i
think
that
it's
correct
to
state,
mr.
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
that
the
first
and
the
very
least
that
the
first
amendment
provides
for
is
that
the
burden
is
not
on
the
person
who
wants
to
make
the
speech
to
come
forth
and
until
and
unless
he
proves
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
state
that
the
communication
is
great
or
has
some
social
value
that
he
then
may
not
make
it,
i
think
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
think
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
think
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
think
the
substance
of
the
issue
is,
as
you
stated,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
speech,
and
i
would
like
to
word
it
this
way,
that
the
speech
is
--
that
there's
no
presumption
either
way
that
the
--
the
person
who
makes
the
speech
has
a
right
to
initially
communicate
with
the
public
without
coming
across
a
censor's
wall.
i
don't
think
the
state
has
any
business
to
know
beforehand
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
what
that
speech
is.
i
think
that
the
state
has
the
burden,
then
to
come
forth.
and
this
court
in
kingsley
books,
and
that
is
as
far
as
this
court
has
ever
gone
in
upholding
a
state
method
of
control,
has
appeared
to
that
view
and
the
way
i
read
your
honors'
opinion
in
that
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that
case
did
not
require
the
prior
submission
of
the
speech
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
to
a
censor.
new
york
did
not
and
could
not
presume
to
the
decisions
of
this
court,
require
that
every
single
book
has
to
be
submitted
to
the
police
commissioner.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
you've
decided
it,
i
think,
with
regard
to
every
other
form
of
speech
but
the
motion
picture.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
we
--
we
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
that's
what
i'm
saying,
mr.
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i'm
saying
that
the
first
amendment
must
apply
equally
to
the
motion
picture
which
has
all
the
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
attributes.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
you've
never
said
it
in
so
many
words,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
no.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
i
was
just
coming
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
to
that
point.
we're
not
--
we're
not
denying
that,
mr.
justice
black.
i
was
just
coming
to
that
point.
i
think
i've
--
i've
--
we've
mentioned
in
our
brief
that
46
other
states
managed
to
get
along
without
requiring
the
prior
submission
of
all
motion
pictures
to
a
censor.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
i
think
that
--
that
on
the
question
of
private
censorship,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
which
is
not,
of
course,
before
the
court,
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
--
would
be
very
difficult
to
outdo
the
respondents.
mr.
felix
j.
bilgrey
well,
there
are
alternative
methods
of
control
that
this
court
has
upheld.
and
i
would
like
to
--
to
mention
that
some
of
these
methods
of
control
have
been
upheld
in
cases
like
chaplinsky
and
alberts
and
kingsley
books
and
that
these
methods
accomplish
everything
that
the
state
can
accomplish,
that
they
are
much
less
invasive.
they
are
much
less
costly
to
the
first
amendment,
to
our
liberties,
pursuant
to
that
first
amendment
than
the
prior
restraint.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
i
think
that
the
citizens
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
all
the
other
states
and
cities
that
do
not
require
that
all
motion
pictures
be
submitted
to
a
board
that
these
citizens
are
just
as
moral
as
chicagoans
would
be
if
they
could
just
see
every
motion
picture
first
without
and
having
been
submitted.
i
would
like
to
leave
some
time
in
rebuttal,
your
honors,
but
i
would
--
i
would
like
to
close
off
in
this
point.
i
think
that
the
decisions
in
this
--
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment,
establish
crystal
--
in
a
crystal
clear
manner
that
whatever
else
the
first
amendment
may
mean,
it
cannot
mean
and
does
not
mean
that
there
can
be
a
censor's
wall
between
any
form
of
speech
in
the
public.
i
think
the
motion
picture
has
all
the
attributes
of
speech.
and
i
think
that
that
same
law
must
apply
to
the
motion
picture
as
a
form
of
speech
as
well.
if
it
does
not,
then
tomorrow,
these
respondents
or
someone
else
will
raise
the
same
issue
with
regard
to
some
other
form
of
speech
and
before
you
know
it,
there
wouldn't
be
anymore
first
amendment.
thank
you.
