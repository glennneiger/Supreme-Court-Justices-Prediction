why
wasn't
such
a

is
that

justice

mr.
bilgrey
at
the
earlier
part
of
the
argument,
you
said
that
what
this
ordinance
does
is
to
prohibit
the
public
exhibition
of
a
film
which
has
not
been
submitted
for
licensing.
now,
is
there
--
is
there
a
definition
of
public
exhibition?
i
assume
that
why
--
what
you
say
by
implication
that
there's
nothing
in
the
ordinance
to
prevent
a
private
exhibition
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
public
exhibition
were
defined
in
any
form.
justice

does
the
statute
in

in
your

your
appendix

although
it
wouldn't

isn't
near
quite
different
also
in
this
way.
you'd
have
a
near
case,
near
against
minnesota
wouldn't
you
if
there
were
an
absolute
refusal
to
license
this
petitioner's
movies
quite

without
viewing
them
at
all
or
without
an
exhibition
of
them
but
solely
on
the
basis
that

made
a
bad
movie.

are
you

(inaudible)
justice

do
you
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
that
there's
any
likelihood
that
