mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
think
there
--
there's
a
serious
question
that
must
be
decided
by
this
court
before
they
get
to
the
merits
of
this
case
namely,
whether
or
not
the
ordinance
is
constitutional
in
regard
to
prior
restraint.
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
no
justiciable
controversy.
the
district
court
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
the
petitioner
should
submit
the
film
to
the
commissioner
of
police
because
otherwise
--
or
if
he
did
and
if
it
was
found
not
objectionable,
the
license
would
have
issued
and
then
there
would
have
been
no
litigation.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
took
a
slightly
different
slant.
circuit
court
of
appeals
said,
"we
cannot
decide
this
case
in
the
vacuum.
we
must
see
the
movie
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
obscene."
counsel
for
the
petitioner
attempts
to
answer
these
contentions
and
i
say
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional
especially
that
portion
of
the
ordinance
that
requires
him
to
submit
the
movie
prior
to
the
time
of
showing
that.
and
his
basis
seems
to
be
limited
to
the
contention
that
the
ordinance
is
unconstitutional.
in
my
opinion,
he
is
predetermining
the
very
issue
that
is
before
this
court
today.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
cannot
hear
you.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
he
has
raised
the
question.
in
my
opinion,
at
the
present
time,
the
municipal
ordinance
say
censorship
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
is
constitutional.
and
until
this
court
or
some
other
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
determines
that
it
is
unconstitutional,
then
this
petitioner
must
comply
with
the
provisions
thereof
including
the
submission
of
this
motion
picture
to
the
commissioner
of
police
prior
to
actual
showing
it.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
yes
sir.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
the
array
--
the
way
that
he
should
raise
the
issue
is
to
submit
through
the
commissioner
of
police
a
pornographic
picture.
then
the
issue
would
be
definitely
raised.
then,
of
course,
the
commissioner
would
--
the
police
commissioner
would
deny
the
permit.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
then
he
is
not
harmed.
in
other
words,
we
must
get
over
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
well,
i
presume
that
when
mr.
justice
harlan
says
maybe
he
decides
not
to
submit
such
a
movie
or
film.
so,
therefore,
he
either
has
to
submit
the
movie
or
he
must
--
(inaudible)
submit
the
movie.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
true.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
true.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
true.
especially
if
the
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
--
picture
was
pornographic.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
yes,
but
it
may
not
raise
the
constitutional
question
because
it
is
our
opinion
that
prior
restraint
is
limited
to
motion
pictures
number
one
and
number
two
to
obscene
motion
pictures.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
not
the
way
i
understand
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
--
i
understand
the
opinion
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
nearly
to
be
that
we
are
not
going
to
pass
upon
an
abstract
opposition
of
law.
that
before
we
are
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
well,
because
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
because
if
the
picture
is
not
obscene
and
if
he
submits
that
picture
to
the
local
police
commissioner,
he
will
get
a
license.
now,
i
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
they
wanted
to
see
the
picture
because
if
the
picture
was
not
obscene,
they
would
order
the
permit
to
issue.
if
they
ordered
the
permit
to
issue,
then
the
question
would
not
be
before
this
court
today.
so
therefore,
in
my
opinion,
it
is
necessary
for
the
plaintiff
to
hurdle
this
first
obstacle
and
that
is
that
he
did
not
present
a
justiciable
controversy
in
the
trial
court
or
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
they
said
that
it
would
not
--
they
could
not
decide.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right
and
they
would
not
decide
a
constitutional
question
unless
they
knew
all
of
the
facts
and
all
the
facts
included
a
--
a
viewing
of
the
picture
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
obscene.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no,
sir.
no.
they
--
they
made
the
statement
that
the
picture
was
not
submitted
either
to
the
court
below
or
to
them.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
the
opinion
does
not
so
state.
the
opinion
merely
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
--
that
is
true.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
well,
in
other
words
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
was
in
the
manner
of
what
--
for
this
reason.
i
understood
the
chief
justice
to
say
that
did
the
court
request
a
showing
of
the
picture.
and
in
my
opinion,
the
court
did
not
request
a
showing
of
the
picture.
the
court
said
that
because
the
picture
was
not
shown
to
us,
we
can't
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no.
no,
but
they
did
not
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
doubt
that.
i
think
personally
that
they
would
suggest
that
there'd
be
a
showing
to
the
commissioner
of
police.
however,
that
is
our
presumptive
because
the
facts
are
that
the
petitioner
did
not
tender.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
had
never
thought
of
the
question
in
exactly
the
same
way
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
so
that
in
our
opinion,
the
petitioner
has
not
presented
a
justiciable
controversy
and
therefore,
this
court
should
summarily
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
without
going
into
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
our
ordinance
is
constitutional.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
because
the
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
--
because
--
that's
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
that
they
have
not
presented
a
justiciable
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
--
i
did
not
understand
you.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
the
officials
of
the
city
of
chicago
believe
as
my
associate
had
said
that
this
ordinance
is
necessary
to
protect
the
welfare
and
morals
of
the
citizenry
of
the
city
chicago.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
do
not
know.
we
have
not
researched
that
problem
and
i
do
--
i
would
not
be
--
have
to.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
would
not
be
able
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
think
that
you're
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
the
same
as
it
was
adapted
in
this
case
here.
the
only
reason
that
is
before
the
federal
court
is
that
there
is
a
diversity
of
citizenship.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
yes.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
citizen
--
the
officials
of
the
city
of
chicago
believe
that
the
enforcement
of
this
ordinance
does
act
as
a
deterrent
to
crime
and
to
juvenile
delinquency.
we
ask
this
court
to
join
the
city
officials
of
the
city
of
chicago
in
their
continuing
effort
to
make
chicago
a
better
place
to
live
by
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
