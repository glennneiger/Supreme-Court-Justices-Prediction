justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you're
saying
i
gather
is
that
on
the
assumption,
this
film,
we
haven't
got
it,
the
hardest,
sort
of
hardcore
pornography.
so
if
the
state
of
illinois
cannot
deal
with
you
through
a
licensing
program
but
it's
--
had
to
let
you
exhibit
then
prosecute
you
if
you
violate
the
criminal
law,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
isn't
that
your
--
isn't
that
your
whole
case?
isn't
that
what
you're
here
about?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
the
fact
that
you
have
to
do.
they
said
you
were
--
they're
prematurely
your
suit.
its
premature
because
the
way
you
raised
your
point
was
to
get
yourselves
prosecuted
and
then
plead
the
invalidity
of
the
licenses
that
require
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
i
understand
it
correctly?
i
--
i
have
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
i
had
much
trouble
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
with
that
and
i
was
wondering
whether
you
understood
it
the
way
i
did.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
saying
that
i
agree
with
it
either.
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
i've
read
the
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
an
administrative
review
of
the
commissioners
or
the
commissioners'
refusal
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
the
mayor.
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
the
mayor?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
the
only
review
procedure?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
then
of
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
might
want
to
present
a
non-pornographic
picture.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
was
that
this
action
is
premature
in
that
what
he
should
have
to
do
is
to
exhibit
his
picture,
let
himself
be
prosecuted
if
the
state
wanted
to
and
then
raise
as
a
defense
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
the
constitutionality
of
the
license
statute.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
is
it
abstract
if
as
he
says
that
the
state
has
no
right
irrespective
of
the
character
of
the
picture
to
require
a
license?
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
is
that
abstract?
i
don't
see
why
it's
abstract.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
your
real
point
is
that
you
shouldn't
be
forced
to
test
the
constitution
--
constitutionality
of
the
statute
to
go
through
a
criminal
proceeding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
can
do
it
by
bringing
an
injunction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
risk
of
review
but
risk
of
the
unpleasantness
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
won't
let
us
look
at
the
film.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
haven't
shown
anybody
the
film.
