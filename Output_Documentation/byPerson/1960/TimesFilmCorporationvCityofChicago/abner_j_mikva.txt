mr.
abner
j.
mikva
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
let
me
first
address
myself
to
this
procedural
question
that
has
arisen
which
i
think
is
best
exemplified
by
justice
stewart's
question
as
to
what
would
have
been
the
easiest
way
to
raise
this
question.
it
would
not
have
been
possible
in
our
opinion
to
go
ahead
and
show
the
movie
and
then
defend
against
the
prosecution
under
this
ordinance
on
the
ground
that
we
will
deny
the
movie
--
we
were
denied
the
permit
because
of
obscenity
because
that
kind
of
a
defense
ignores
two
other
sections
of
this
ordinance
which
we
think
or
at
least
we're
not
prepared
to
challenge.
one
is
a
revenue
section.
the
city
gets
quite
a
bit
of
revenue
out
of
this
ordinance,
1553
provides
for
permit
fees
and
transfer
permit
fees.
and
the
second
is
a
registration
section
of
this
ordinance
which
we
are
not
challenged
which
requires
each
subsequent
transferee
to
advise
the
city
as
to
what
theater
the
picture
is
playing
it.
now,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
either
of
those
or
both
of
those
are
perfectly,
constitutionally
valid
so
that
if
we
came
in
and
tried
to
defend
against
a
prosecution
for
refusing
to
have
a
permit,
a
court,
whether
it
was
state
or
federal,
would
be
perfectly
justified
in
saying
to
us,
"look
here,
you
may
be
right
but
you
have
no
right
to
ignore
these
other
constitutional
sections
of
the
ordinance
and
therefore,
you
cannot
ignore
the
licensing
procedure."
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct,
sir.
the
second
reason
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
we
did.
we
tendered
the
permit
fee
and
we
offered
to
meet
every
other
section
of
the
ordinance
and
did
meet
it
other
than
this
requirement
of
prior
submission.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
if
on
a
criminal
prosecution,
i
don't
see
how,
sir.
then
we
are
being
prosecuted
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
we
are
then
being
prosecuted
for
being
there
without
a
license
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
you
can
exhibit?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
you
can?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
we
say
one
can
exhibit
without
a
discretionary
license.
i
don't
know
that
if
these
were
purely
non-discretionary
license
which
is
what
would
be
left
to
the
ordinance
if
our
position
is
sustained,
i
don't
know
that
the
constitution
forbids
a
purely
administrative
non-discretionary
type
of
license
(inaudible).
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
revenue,
registration
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
police
purposes
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
they
want
to
know
where
the
picture
is
being
exhibited.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
right.
now,
we
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well,
my
second
reason?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
they
were
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
there
were
purely
alternative
counts.
our
first
count
asked
this
city
to
--
that
a
mandatory
injunction
be
issued
directing
the
city
to
issue
a
permit.
now,
that
was
the
second
reason
for
this
procedure.
this
is
the
judicial
gloss
that
was
placed
up
in
this
ordinance
by
illinois'
highest
court,
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
the
american
civil
liberties
union
where
these
issues
were
squarely
raised
where
the
constitutional
question
was
decided
adversely
to
our
position.
we
freely
admit
that.
and
there,
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
that
were
the
petitioner
has
a
complaint
to
make
about
some
section
of
the
ordinance,
he
can
come
in
by
way
of
injunction
proceedings
seeking
to
enjoin
the
mayor
or
mandamus,
they
said
either
one,
seeking
to
enjoin
the
mayor
and
the
police
commissioner
to
issue
them
the
permit
that
they
request.
and
i
quote,
if
i
may,
from
that
part
of
the
case
whether
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
it's
the
american
civil
liberties
union
versus
city
of
chicago,
3
illinois
2nd
334
page
352,
it's
quoted
on
page
11
of
our
brief."
if
the
plaintiff
however,"
i'm
quoting
now,
"alleges
that
one
or
more
of
the
conditions
required
for
a
license
are
invalid,
he
may
proceed
either
by
mandamus
or
by
injunction.
whether
a
complaint
alleging
only
that
a
motion
picture
is
not
obscene
would
state
a
ground
for
equitable
relief,
we
need
not
decide."
in
the
present
case,
the
plaintiff
does
not
(inaudible)
at
their
complaint
for
they
asserted
that
the
ordinance
was
invalid
and
claimed
the
right
to
exhibit
their
--
their
film
without
obtaining
a
permit.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct
and
the
state
court
there
held
that
the
ordinance
was
constitutional
against
the
subject
and
therefore,
that
--
that
is,
i
say,
the
highest
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
interpretation
placed
on.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
we
claim
that
the
requirement
of
the
ordinance
that
says
you
must
submit
your
picture
in
advance
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
but
they
--
they
denied
our
federal
ground
and
this
court
denied
to
review
that
case,
therefore,
one
of
our
final
judgment
because
there
were
both
grounds
involved
there.
maybe
i
can
explain
at
this
way,
your
honor.
the
state
court
acted
exactly
contrary
to
the
way
the
federal
court
would
act
in
the
similar
situation.
the
federal
court
would
say
if
there
is
a
non-constitutional
question
to
be
reached
and
decided
and
that
disposes
of
the
case,
we
will
not
decide
the
constitutional
question,
if
i
understand
my
legal
precedence
correct.
and
therefore,
once
the
non-constitutional
question
is
decided,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
act
that
way,
they
decided
both
questions.
they
decided
the
non
--
both
the
constitutional
question
and
then
send
it
back
for
a
finding
on
the
non-constitutional
question.
that's
what
they
did
in
that
case.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
as
an
entirety,
then
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
we
might
be
raising
a
federal
question
but
i'm
afraid
it
would
be
decided
adversely
to
us
because
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
think
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
but
i
think
that
the
revenue
section
of
this
ordinance
is
constitutional.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
but
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
but
you
can't
get
a
permit
unless
you
pay
the
money.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
all
i
can
say
there
again
is
that
the
city
themselves
conceded
that
if
we
showed
this
movie
without
a
permit,
we
would
be
prosecuted
on
the
ground
that
we
didn't
have
a
permit,
not
that
we
didn't
submit
the
picture,
but
that
we
didn't
have
a
permit.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
and
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
only
as
to
certain
requirements
of
this
ordinance,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well,
it
varies.
it's
$3
per
(inaudible)
fee.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
right.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
right.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
suppose
at
that
point,
you
might
be
able
to
raise
the
same
defense.
i
think
the
question
is,
is
there
something
magical
over
that
method
of
procedure
over
the
one
we
did
which
is
almost
like
years
except
that
at
the
point
where
they
said,
"you
can't
have
the
permit
because
you
won't
show
us
the
picture,"
instead
of
going
ahead
and
showing
the
film,
we
then
took
the
further
review
that
the
ordinance
authorizes
under
the
interpretation
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
they
further
review,
there
has
been
authorized
by
this
court
in
other
cases.
we
cited
the
cargill
case
in
our
brief
wherein
a
non-first
amendment
kind
of
a
case
where
the
person
was
entitled
to
come
up
and
appeal
after
it
offered
to
comply
with
the
constitutional
portions,
refused
to
comply
with
the
unconstitutional
portions,
it
was
then
permitted
to
--
to
prosecute
its
appeal
to
have
the
unconstitutional
portion
declared
invalid.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
can
i
answer
this
way,
your
honor,
that
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
any
clearer
case
than
this.
and
again,
i
wanted
to
cite
this
--
this
cargill
case.
well,
that
it
exactly
what
the
petitioners
did.
and
this
court
said
if
the
commission
refused
to
grant
a
license
because
the
applicant
in
the
one
case
refused
to
comply
with
statutory
provisions
or
with
rules
or
regulations
inconsistent
with
the
constitution
of
united
states,
the
rights
of
the
applicant
or
the
license
could
be
protected
and
enforced
by
appropriate
judicial
proceedings.
it
didn't
say
only
in
criminal
proceedings
for
proceeding
without
a
license,
it
said
appropriate
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
cargill
versus
minnesota,
180
united
states
452,
page
468.
we
cited
at
page
8
of
our
brief.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
right
and
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
it's
the
same.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i'm
saying
it's
one
of
the
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
may
i
rephrase
it
this
way
then,
your
honor.
i'd
say
its
one
of
the
risks
we
would
take
in
going
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
to
the
other
way.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i'm
--
we'll
remember
that
for
our
future
case,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
of
the
unpleasantness
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
of
--
of
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
in
the
state
court?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
--
actually
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
the
main
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
the
main
reason
is
delay.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
federal
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
it's
much
quicker
in
the
federal
court.
the
--
and
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
am
sure
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
was
the
main
reason
here
for
avoiding
the
state
court.
there
would
have
been
one
more
level
of
review
to
go
through
too,
of
course,
in
the
state
court
and
it
wasn't
the
federal
system
because
we
do
have
the
trial
courts,
the
appellate
courts
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
which
had
already
ruled
on
this
question.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well,
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
already
ruled
again
on
this
very
question.
now,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
what
i
think
is
the
other
central
issue
here
that's
been
raised.
discontinue
referring
to
the
idea
that
this
picture
must
be
presumed
obscene.
and
there's
a
syllogism
there
that's
very
important
because
without
the
major
premise
that
the
city
and
the
court
below
adapts
that
this
picture
must
be
presumed
obscene
simply
because
we
didn't
submit
it.
there
is
no
basis
for
upholding
the
interference.
this
court
has
said
there
are
some
cases
where
interference
with
speech
is
permitted
and
it
has
detailed
the
kinds
of
speech
and
kinds
of
situation
in
which
such
interference
is
tolerating
such
as
using
kingsley
books
as
the
best
example.
obscene
speech
is
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
well,
therefore,
for
them
to
bring
themselves
within
the
exception
of
the
kingsley
case,
they
must
say
that
this
film
has
been
presumed
to
be
obscene.
there's
no
finding
of
obscenity.
nobody
ever
said
it
was
obscene
except
all
that
was
before
the
city
was
the
title
of
the
movie.
so
then
unless
they
say
the
whole
art
is
presumed
to
be
obscene,
unless
and
until
it's
brought
to
--
to
review
and
it's
proven
innocent
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
your
honor,
let
me
say
something
about
the
permit.
justice
frankfurter
asked
that
question.
the
permit
is
a
little
blue
strip
of
paper
at
chicago.
it
has
the
name
of
the
picture,
the
amount
of
the
license
fee
and
it's
signed
by
the
city
collector.
it
is
not
the
city
sanctioning,
approving
or
authorizing
the
showing
of
the
film.
it
is
a
permit
fee.
and
as
the
--
they
say
it,
the
issuance
of
this
little
blue
permit,
that's
all
the
city
does
when
it
issues
the
permit.
the
court
is
not
being
asked
to
sanction
or
authorize
the
showing
of
this
film.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no
more
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
--
i
meant
authorizing
in
terms
of
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
approving.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
it
is
not
approving
of
the
contents
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
of
the
film.
it
might
be
a
very
bad
film.
the
city
is
not
saying
that
it's
a
good
film.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no.
the
city
is
saying
that?
not
at
the
time
it
issue
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
if
it's
--
if
it's
submitted,
yes,
you
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
no.
i
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
hypothetical
that
justice
whittaker
asked
before.
under
the
present
ordinance
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
of
course
they're
saying
it's
obscene.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
whether
or
not
it's
obscene
because
there's
no
reason
to
assume
that
it
is
obscene.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no.
and
therefore,
it's
the
same
thing
as
--
as
a
printing
press
or
any
other
form
of
communication.
you
make
no
assumption
about
it.
it's
up
to
the
city
and
the
state
to
come
forward
with
pretty
convincing
proof
that
this
falls
within
one
of
the
exception
areas.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
it
would
be
a
different
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that'd
be
--
say
be
entitled
to
see
it
but
it's
not
this
case.
your
honor,
this
is
the
same
thing
that
could
be
said
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well,
let
me
get
to
that.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
your
honor,
let
me
get
to
the
reasons
why
we
won't
show
it.
and
that
really
is
--
is
the
other
part
of
this
defense
that
the
court
below
has
put
up.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
it
would
not
be
this
case.
i
know
that'd
be
decided
the
same
as
this
case
or
not.
but
i'd
like
to
say
the
reasons,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
why
we
think
that
this
refusal
to
submit
is
important.
all
that
the
city
has
come
up
with
and
all
that
the
court
below
has
come
up
with
is
that
somehow
movies
are
different
than
newspaper.
no,
the
chicago
tribune
can't
be
submitted
--
required
to
submit
to
this
requirement
but
motion
pictures
can.
why?
and
all
we
get
--
come
up
with
--
and
i
kept
writing
down
the
different
answers
that
the
city
gave
to
these
questions
both
here
and
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
one
i
finally
distilled
out
is
that
it's
shown
in
the
dark.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
they're
using
a
pretty
big
shotgun
because
of
their
fear
of
the
dark.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
motion
picture
is
a
communication
at
least
it
has
to
be
presumed
to
be
one.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
let
me
say
why
it's
not
abstract,
your
honor.
let
me
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
say
the
things
that
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
what?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
what?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
your
honor,
in
kingsley
books,
which
is
the
furthest
this
court
has
ever
gone,
the
court
relied
on
a
specific
finding
indeed
i
think
an
admission
of
pornography
to
justify
the
extraordinary
interference
with
freedom
of
speech.
we
say
there
must
be
something
comparable
to
that.
i'd
like
to
hope,
your
honor,
that
it
will
be
at
very
--
the
very
least
that
requirement.
but
we're
saying
that
at
least
there
must
be
something
comparable
to
that
requirement
met
in
a
case
before
the
interference
can
be
justified.
just
at
what
point
the
court
is
going
to
draw
that
line
is
a
hard
question
for
me
to
answer,
your
honor.
as
i
say,
i
hope
it
would
not
go
beyond
the
point
it
was
drawn
in
the
kingsley
books
case.
but
certainly,
even
in
that
case
which
drew
the
line
further
than
it
had
ever
been
drawn
before,
there
was
a
firm
and
positive
finding
by
a
court
that
the
matter
was
obscene.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well,
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
no,
your
honor.
if
i
said
that,
then
--
then
i
misspoke.
i
said
i
can't
answer
where
this
court
would
draw
that
line.
it
is
a
different
case
than
this
case.
and
conceivably,
the
court
could
draw
the
line.
yes,
some
kind
of
finding
is
alright
but
no,
this
kind
of
shotgun
approach
is
not.
that
is
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
pardon?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
not
a
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
the
question
is
--
the
question
is
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
right,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
agree,
your
honor.
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
i
am
addressing
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
question
that
was
raised
by
some
of
the
other
justices.
we
don't
think
that
the
presumption
should
go
one
way
or
the
other,
that
it
is
not
relevant.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
purely
--
well,
supposed
it's
a
purely
a
revenue
permit.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well,
i
know
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
--
it's
part
of
the
same
statute,
your
honor,
that's
our
difficulty.
section
1553
of
this
very
ordinance
is
purely
and
simply
a
revenue
measure
which
can
stand
by
itself
as
far
as
i
can
see.
and
if
the
court
would've
strike
--
grant
our
full
petition
for
relief,
that
section
could
still
stand
and
the
city
could
continue
to
collect
revenue
from
every
motion
picture
who
has
exhibited.
it's
not
confiscatory.
we've
never
claimed
it
was.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i
don't
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well
--
well
we've
never
said
--
the
question
here
is
that
how
can
you
say
it's
pornographic
when
you
it
--
when
you
have
nothing
on
which
to
base
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
sir.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
because
the
next
statement
that
could
come
out
of
my
mouth,
your
honor,
could
be
an
obscene
statement.
i
hope
it
isn't.
no
one
says
that
i
should
go
to
either
the
district
of
columbia
or
to
the
city
of
chicago
and
get
a
permit
to
--
before
and
tell
them
in
advance
what
i'm
going
to
say
to
this
court.
if
i
do
make
an
obscene
statement,
this
court
and
the
government
of
the
district
have
ample
protection
to
--
to
punish
me
which
in
turn
would
deter
others
from
making
that
statement
and
to
keep
me
from
making
it
in
the
future.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
the
limited
--
there
is
because
this
court
said
so
in
kingsley
books.
there
are
certainly
--
i
would
have
to
--
i'd
have
to
say
there's
the
limited
injunction
power
of
kingsley
books
but
that
was
predicated,
as
i
said
before,
on
a
finding
of
obscenity
before
that
remedy
was
--
was
enforced.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
pardon?
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
but
nobody
showed
the
book
to
the
new
york
board
before
the
book
was
distributed
in
--
in
kingsley
books
either.
they
want
to
have
them
and
sold
the
book
and
then
the
police
came
in
and
read
the
book
and
decided
it
was
obscene
and
persuaded
the
judge
that
it
was
obscene.
and
then
the
injunction
was
issued.
now,
that's
altogether
different
from
this
which
says,
"you
submit
everything
to
us
and
we
will
let
the
obscene
--
we
will
let
the
unobscene
go
through
and
the
obscene
cannot
go
through.
now,
but
--
and
this
is
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make,
what
is
the
importance
of
this
refusal
to
submit
to
--
to
the
motion
picture
distributor?
first
of
all,
there's
a
nature
of
the
function
of
the
censors.
what
way
it
is
that
the
censors
work?
this
court
has
before
it
in
the
record
of
--
of
the
different
case
between
the
same
parties,
a
description,
a
detailed
description
of
how
the
censors
work
and
i
cite
that
record
to
you
not
because
the
chicago
censors
are
better
than
or
worse
than
other
censors
but
because
it
is
the
nature
of
the
animal.
censors
job
is
to
censor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
he
(voice
overlap)
censor
for,
just
as
the
mayor
delegates
it
to
his
corporation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
your
honor,
they
are
civilian
employees.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
no,
there's
a
police
sergeant
who
is
in
charge
of
the
detail
and
censor
board
itself
is
usually
six
women
or
--
or
occasionally
a
man,
the
civilian
employees
of
the
police
department.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
well,
they're
supposedly
civil
service
but
they
are
given
temporary
appointment
somewhere
between
permanent
and
ad
hoc.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
about
15,
your
honor.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
and
four
states
(inaudible).
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
illinois
is
not
one
of
the
states.
chicago
has
the
ordinance
but
illinois
itself
does
not
have
any
kind
of
prior
submission
--
statute.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
yes,
it
was
cited
in
the
motion
pictures
association
brief
amicus
in
their
table
at
the
back
and
that
this
--
all
of
the
cities
and
also
the
kinds
of
reviewer
that
they
have.
the
second
thing
i'd
like
to
make
is
the
difference
between
and
perhaps
this
answers
your
question,
justice
whittaker.
the
difference
between
this
kind
of
proceeding,
which
i
might
add
has
hearing
procedure,
has
none
of
the
due
process
safeguards
that
a
criminal
proceeding
would
have.
there's
no
presumption
of
innocence.
as
i've
indicated
the
presumption
rather
it's
one
of
guilt.
prove
your
pictures
clean
or
else
you
can't
get
a
permit.
so
the
contrary,
its
the
criminal
procedure
where
it's
up
to
the
prosecutor
to
prove
to
a
trial
court
and
perhaps
even
a
grand
jury
in
the
first
place
and
a
judge,
that
this
is
obscene
literature.
it
was
said
best
i
might
add.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
due
process
in
the
sense
of
the
kinds
of
protections
that
are
afforded
to
speech
rather
than
due
process
in
the
kinds
of
protection
that
are
afforded
the
individual.
i
think
it
was
best
said
by
this
very
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
sitting
with
a
different
panel
in
a
case
called
capital
enterprises
versus
the
city
of
chicago,
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
said
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
censoring
motion
pictures
before
deciding
that
they
can
be
publicly
exhibited
and
exhibiting
a
picture
to
the
public
for
which
criminal
punishment
might
be
imposed.
in
the
latter
situation,
all
the
familiar
procedural
safeguards
come
in
to
play
while
in
the
other
instance,
there
are
no
procedural
safeguards
and
communication
is
choked
off
at
the
threshold.
now,
i'm
quoting
from
page
37
of
our
brief.
as
i
say
this
was
a
case
where
they
reversed
the
censor
board.
significantly,
i
might
add,
the
other
function,
the
demonstrations
of
the
functions
of
the
censors
is
indicated
from
our
appendix
where
every
single
decision
of
there
banning
a
picture
since
burstyn
has
been
reversed
if
the
--
the
senate
were
to
be
alarmed.
now,
the
other
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
the
timeliness
of
the
speech.
would
the
declaration
of
independence
or
the
gettysburg
address
have
been
as
effective
if
it
has
been
made
five
years
later?
with
the
great
debates
that
are
going
on
right
now,
these
are
effective
if
they
were
made
after
november
8th,
as
they
are
right
now.
this
case
has
been
going
on
two
and
a
half
year,
your
honor.
the
subject
matter
of
american
civil
liberties
union
versus
city
of
chicago
was
the
miracle,
the
same
picture
involved
in
the
burstyn
case.
it
took
five
years
to
clear
that
picture
under
this
ordinance.
and
significantly,
it
never
did
show
in
the
city
of
chicago.
this
is
the
kind
of
concern
that
this
priority
restraint
brings
about.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
that
is
the
decision
of
the
first
amendment
says
it
should
be
left
to
the
people.
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
and
this
--
mr.
abner
j.
mikva
if
it
covers.
i
think
that
the
only
way
you
could
say
that
it
does
cover,
your
honor,
is
to
say
that
somehow
this
is
not
a
speech
but
motion
pictures
communicate.
they
express
ideas,
yes,
and
they
express
advocacy.
and
the
rights
we
fight
for
the
day
for
times
film
is
also
and
has
the
counterpart
of
the
right
to
hear.
and
unless
you
can
find
that
this
is
not
speech,
it
seems
to
me
it's
governed
by
(inaudible)
