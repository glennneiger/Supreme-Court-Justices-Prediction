justice
william
o.
douglas
that
isn't
the
--
go
to
issue
on
that
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you're
--
you're
not
--
you're
not
denying
that
--
that
you
may
--
that
you
may
not
be
liable
if
the
--
the
petitioner
might
be
prosecuted
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
to
show
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
you
think
the
chicago
tribune
could
be
required
to
submit
its
copy
to
chicago
censor
before
it
went
the
press?
justice
william
o.
douglas
newspapers
have
comic
strips
these
days,
don't
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
could
prosecute
them
if
they
did.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
a
harder
role
for
you
than
--
than
an
easy
stroke
of
a
censor.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
argument
applies
to
the
chicago
tribune
as
well
as
to
the
movie.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you
would
--
you'd
the
first
to
say
chicago
has
no
power
to
censor
the
chicago
tribune.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
you
don't
disagree
with
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
it.
any
paper
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
in
chicago.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
we
didn't
--
haven't
restricted
the
first
amendment,
the
newspapers,
have
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
it
extended
to
novels
and
poetry
and
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we're
in
the
field
of
entertainment
when
--
as
well
as
news
when
we're
talking
about
first
amendment
rights,
have
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
--
why
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
do
you
make
that
presumption
in
the
case
of
a
movie
but
not
in
the
case
of
a
newspaper?
justice
william
o.
douglas
a
newspaper
editor
stands
up
and
says,
"i
refuse
to
submit
my
copy
to
your
censor."
would
you
say,
yes,
i
presume
therefore,
he's
a
communist,
i
presume
therefore,
that
he's
--
want
to
publish
seditious
libels.
i
presume
therefore,
he's
going
to
publish
obscene
literature.
no,
you
wouldn't
say
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
our
issue.
that's
our
issue
whether
it
is
constitutional
proper
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
do
--
i
don't
see
where
this
presumption
arises.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
it
is
pornography.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we're
talking
about
a
constitutional
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
why
do
you
say
that?
people
sometimes
are
--
want
greater
freedom
than
the
bureaucracy
of
government
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
hope
so.
justice
william
o.
douglas
360.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
true.
any
book
that's
pornographic
that's
been
solved.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
wouldn't
be
(voice

--
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
he
could
--
if
he
was
denied
a
permit,
he
could
--
he
could
appeal,
come
up
here
and
we
could
do
it
in
determining
whether
it's
obscene,
that's
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that
was
just
one
of
the
alternate
prayers
anyway.
justice
william
o.
douglas
serving
what
purpose?
revenue
or
what?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that
--
perhaps
a
confusion
of
reason
by
a
reason
of
the
first
prayer
of
your
relief,
they
may
--
should
get
a
permit
because
if
this
permit
system
is
unconstitutional,
a
permit
becomes
irrelevant.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that's
a
--
never
--
never
statute
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
but
this
is
