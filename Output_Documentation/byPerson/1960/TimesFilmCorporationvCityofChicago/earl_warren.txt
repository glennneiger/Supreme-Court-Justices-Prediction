chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
--
how
then
do
you
--
how
then
do
you
happen
to
say
in
your
brief
at
page
4,
illinois
court
said
consistently
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
this
very
ordinance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
answered
justice
frankfurter
that
--
that
the
courts
had
not
tested
this
--
this
ordinance.
chief
justice

and
all
of
those
they
did
--
they
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
save
the
ordinance
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
manner
that
supports
your
position
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
i
understand
you
raise
no
question
about
whether
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
should
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
this
issue
before
they
come
into
the
federal
courts?
chief
justice

warren
mr.
drebin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
insisted
on
seeing
the
picture
itself?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
thought
you
said
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
wanted
to
see
the
picture.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
want
the
picture
to
be
viewed
by
themselves
even
though
it
had
not
been
passed
on
by
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
--
if
the
petitioner
wanted
to
get
his
rights
through
the
state
courts,
what
procedure
would
he
adapt
in
the
situation
of
this
kind
for
the
--
for
the
mayor
and
the
commissioner
refuse
the
permit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
--
i
didn't
understand
that
it
was
here
on
diversity
of
citizenship
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
that
is
the
reason
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
it's
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
yes.
well,
i
didn't
understand
that.

justice
earl
warren
mr.
mikva.
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
you
offer
to
comply
with
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
that
take
--
wouldn't
that
take
those
issues
out
of
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
oh,
that
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
didn't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
how
many
cities
