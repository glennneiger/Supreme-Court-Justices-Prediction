justice
felix
frankfurter
in
effect,
are
you
saying
that
--
that's
a
pretty
good
question.
continue
then.
i
in
effect
say
that
although
in
a
complaint,
although
your
complaint
might
have
made
--
stated,
alleged
that
in
fact
we
want
to
show
a
pornographic
picture.
but
in
as
much
as
municipal
--
the
relevant
municipal
provisions
of
the
municipal
court
of
chicago
are
unconstitutional
there
is
no
law,
therefore
there's
no
regulatory
provision
and
therefore
we're
free
to
show
it.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
we
must
take
judicial
notice
that
no
pornographic
films
would
--
could
possibly
be
produced
or
desired
to
be
shown
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
anybody
in
the
united
states.
i
should
think
i
should
take
judicial
notice
into
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
but
you
just
trying
to
raise
--
a
legal
question,
of
an
abstract
legal
question,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
that
the
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
merely
on
the
assumption
that
you
wouldn't
be
pro
--
you
wouldn't
be
submitting
anything
for
the
pure
or
quasi
pure
a
film.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
pornography
sometime
is
profitable,
unfortunately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
--
you
were
charmingly
tendered
when
you
said
that
your
legal
proposition
in
effect
is
that
though
you
would
say
you're
ready
to
--
that
your
--
you
filed
a
complaint
to
say
you
want
to
show
a
pornographic
picture
but
since
there
is
no
prohibition
to
any
municipal
regulation,
you're
entitled
to
show
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they're
not
effective,
should
no
regulatory
schemes,
is
that
what
the
first
case
hold?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
what
burstyn
had
hold
to
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
consistently
never
--
never
pronounced
your
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
may
not
eventually
so
pronounced
(inaudible)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
suggesting
that
it
has
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
cases
that
had
been
before
us
to
which
either
opinions
were
written
of
per
curiam
decisions.
aren't
they
all
--
aren't
the
ordinances
or
if
there
were
state
statutes,
aren't
they
all
found
then
you
got
it
because
of
the
vagueness
or
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
regulatory
statutes
rather
than
the
statute
as
--
rather
because
there
were
regulations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
suppose
this
had
any
criterion
that
lawyers
can't
frame
a
convention
they
can
get
here.
i'm
just
wanting
to
know
where
we
are
as
of
this
moment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
true,
isn't
it?
that
all
the
adjudications
thus
far
have
been
very
careful
not
to
pass
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
near
wasn't
a
movie,
i
think,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
the
implication
is
that
it's
innocuous
and
therefore
they
ought
not
to
be
censored
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
keep
on
saying
speech
because
you
think
that
speech
or
because
a
movie
or
films
are
a
mode
of
communication
that
is
something
that
one
sees
or
hears,
therefore,
as
a
general
concept
called
speech
which
covers
everything,
political
utterance,
an
editorial
in
newspaper,
a
book,
discs,
music,
movies,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
notion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
don't
make
any
differentiation
and
you
just
say
the
question
before
this
court
is
abstractly
considered
where
the
speech
may
ever
be
enjoined,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
i
do
not
understand
why
you
did
not
agree
with
the
question
of
the
court
or
the
inquiries
made
to
you
by
justice
whittaker,
namely,
you
contend
that
no
matter
what
this
film,
if
seen,
would
show,
no
matter
what
its
contents,
no
matter
what
it
depicts,
doesn't
matter,
vicious,
good,
bad,
neutral,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
the
state
is
powerless
in
view
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
ask
that
it
be
seen
before
it
can
exhibit.
isn't
that
the
correct
statement
of
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
involves
a
concession
but
--
but
to
you
it's
a
matter
of
indifference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
as
a
person.
i
don't
mean
your
moral
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
legal
proposition,
it
is
a
wholly
immaterial.
you're
not
called
upon
to
show
that
it
isn't
good.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
any
presumption
regarding
this
particular
undisclosed
film.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
a
legal
proposition
if
i
follow
your
argument
at
all.
that
for
purposes
of
the
question
before
the
court,
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference,
what
the
character
or
quality
or
methods
or
whatever
you
may
say
about
a
film,
it's
a
matter
of
indifference.
it
maybe
at
once
the
most
notable
and
noble
depiction
or
it
maybe
the
violent
depiction
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
question
before
the
court,
that
is
a
matter
of
indifference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
contesting
your
proposition.
i'm
trying
to
leave
no
doubt
what
it
is
that
you're
dis
--
discussing
and
so
i
want
you
--
i
want
it
possible
to
have
you
say
without
any
further
ambiguity
what
the
issue
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
now
answered
me
that,
whatever
the
words
may
be,
you
now
answered
me
that
the
purpose
of
the
proposition
that
you
are
tendering
to
the
court
is
a
matter
of
complete
indifference,
what
this
film
if
seen
would
disclose.
that
is
correct,
isn't
it?
is
that
the
question?
you
can
state
in
your
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
substance
of
your
issue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
--
that
case
wasn't
this
case.
that
was
a
totally
different
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we've
never
decided
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
why
we
are
here
about
a
motion
picture.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
weren't
--
you
just
say
that
a
motion
picture
is
no
different
than
if
you
had
before
us
who
captures
the
camera
on
a
book
form,
that's
what
you're
saying,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
ever
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
said
that?
have
we
ever
said
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
we're
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
know
what
type
of
censorship
they
have
that
are
just
as
effective.
i
can
assure
you
there
are
states
which
have
private
censorships
far
more
effective
than
your
police
censorship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
merely
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
merely
said
they
got
along
with.
i
say
you're
going
to
draw
on
what
they
get
along
with
and
you
also
have
to
take
into
account
other
methods
of
producing
the
same
result.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it
you
meant
that
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
or
to
be
a
good
impulse
of
generosity,
he
will
do
that
voluntarily
but
he
doesn't
want
to
be
coerced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
could
make
a
lot
of
difference.
if
i
do
something
out
of
my
own
good
nature
or
weakness
or
do
it
because
i'm
compelled
to
do
it.
i
can
assure
you
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you'd
also
--
you
--
you
can't
show
it
to
the
municipality.
you've
got
to
show
it
to
some
persons.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
show
it
to
the
chief
of
police
as
a
private
individual
in
a
uniform
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
the
mayor
with
a
uniform
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
here
says
the
mayor,
does
it
mean
the
mayor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
an
appeal
from
the
police
commissioner
to
the
mayor,
what
factors
do
you
have
for
such
an
appeal
taken?
i
mean
i
would
--
who
--
i
wonder
who
would
decide
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
ask
you.
the
mayor
--
this
is
the
mayor,
mr.
daley
today,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
he
discharged
his
personal
responsibility
for
making
a
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
justice
whittaker's
close
confinement
of
the
issue
--
issue,
it
can
govern
our
consideration,
it
means
that
they
want
public
authority
to
say
it's
alright
to
talk
to
--
to
show
a
show
no
matter
what
its
content.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
--
the
question
--
in
other
words,
the
suit
is
not
declared
this
--
this
ordinance
unconstitutional
and
therefore
be
free
to
do
what
you
will
but
it
is
to
get
a
certificate
from
the
city
of
chicago
that
you
may
show
this,
so
that
we
have
the
city
of
chicago
sponsoring
what
might
be
a
vicious
bill.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
don't
get
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
don't
have
to
apply
the
interpretations
of
legal
doctrines,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you,
this
ordinance,
you
say
it's
50
years
old.
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
been
prosecutions
done
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
so
that
it
never
comes
up
on
the
--
for
violation
of
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
violations
--
if
you
have
violations
for
not
--
for
showing
films
without
a
permit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
you
couldn't
prosecute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
is
that
a
part
of
the
ordinance
or
is
that
a
separate
part
of
your
city
ordinance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
your
civil
court
or
your
criminal
police
court,
whatever
they
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
tell
me,
isn't
it
a
form
of
a
permit
that
is
granted
in
the
record
or
any
other
brief?
perhaps
you
know
it
from
memory,
what
does
it
say?
what
does
the
permit
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
those
cases
where
they
denied
the
permit
and
the
--
the
applicant
challenged
the
denial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
way
the
cases
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
other
cases,
they
did
submit
films
and
--
and
the
application
was
rejected
and
they
claimed
that
it
was,
for
one
reason
or
another,
rejected
in
violation
of
the
duty
to
grant
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
it
should
have
been
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
now,
in
this
case,
this
is
different
because
on
this
case,
he
didn't
tender
a
movie.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
clear
about
that.
in
those
other
cases,
movies
were
tendered
for
the
granting
of
a
permit
and
the
permit
was
refused
because
the
authorities
thought
that
they
violated
the
ordinance
and
they
then
said
that
they
didn't
violate
the
ordinance,
they
should
have
granted
on
the
merits.
he
had
challenged
the
power
to
require
submission
--
he
had
challenged
the
power
to
not
to
call
for
a
permit
but
to
submit
the
movie
in
order
to
justify
the
granting
of
it.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
they
also
attacked
the
ordinance
but
they
did
both
things.
they
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
should
granted
under
the
ordinance.
we're
entitled
to
have
it.
of
course,
we
--
we
do
not
come
in
with
the
--
we
do
not
come
within
the
prohibition
of
the
ordinance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
they
do
not
make
any
such
claim,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
say
you
should
have
granted
us
because
you
couldn't
possibly
withhold
no
matter
what
the
movie
is
and
we
will
show
it
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
they
needed
any
permit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't
--
and
that
the
claim
was
made
(a)
they're
entitled
to
the
permit
within
the
ordinance,
(b)
they
don't
need
the
ordinance
is
invalid
and
therefore,
they
don't
need
a
permit.
here,
he
said
he
should
grant
them
of
permit
because
he
has
no
business
to
see
what
the
film
is.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
want
the
permit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
can
look
at
the
record
and
one
will.
so
far
as
you
have
knowledge,
what
is
the
point
--
what
is
the
question
justice
whittaker
raised
a
little
while
ago
in
those
other
cases
namely
that
they're
entitled
to
a
permit
but
with
--
can
withhold
a
showing
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
the
whole
thing
is
bad
and
i
don't
have
to
make
any
application.
i'm
not
now
indicating,
i
don't
--
because
i
don't
know.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
that
--
of
that
distinction
that
justice
whittaker
has
pointed
out
that
it's
one
thing
to
say,
"i
do
not
have
to
apply
and
i
can
show
it
without
your
lead.
it's
another
thing
that
you
must
give
me
lead."
so
i
do
not
need
to
show
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
this
application
went
to
the
mayor,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
i
wonder
if
--
if
what
was
just
said
--
isn't
what
you
said
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice?
as
i
understood
the
chief
justice
did
ask
you
if
the
court
of
appeals
expressed
the
readiness
in
order
to
pass
on
the
case
and
have
the
film
shown
to
them
although
it
had
not
been
shown
to
the
city
authorities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
it
(inaudible).
we
are
being
asked
--
we
are
being
asked
to
adjudicate
an
abstract
question
of
law
based
upon
an
incomplete
junction
of
facts
without
knowledge
of
the
film's
content,
the
district
court
and
we
are
not
in
the
position
to
determine
whether
--
whether
a
plaintiff
has
a
right
to
exhibit
its
films
without
city
censorship.
i
should
think
it's
ordinary
interpretation
to
say
that
if
it
was
shown
to
them,
then
it
was
as
clean
as
houndstooth
in
the
(inaudible),
then
they
would
hold
that
they
had
no
business
--
that
--
that
they're
entitled
to
show
it.
does
--
does
any
inference
allowable
from
language
that's
what
this
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
call
for
reconsideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
didn't
so
in
any
--
didn't
say
in
any
event,
it
is
not
for
us
to
pass
on
this
bill,
you
must
first
go
to
the
city
censorship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
say
that,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
--
but
your
point
now
is
that
they
didn't
say
--
we
--
we
asked
you
to
show
it
to
us
and
you
deny
it.
they
said,
"you
haven't
made
--
attended
to
show
it
to
us."

felix
frankfurter

district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
they're
--
i
--
i
think
if
one,
insofar
as
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
is
relevant,
they,
as
one
reach
it
as
i
have
said,
they
said,
"you
haven't
shown
us.
you
have
to
show
neither
to
the
district
court
nor
to
us
but
still,
on
the
showing
of
which
we
may
find
that
it
is
as
pure
as
a
new
born
baby.
and
if
that
was
so,
then
we
would
grant
your
prayer
and
direct
the
censors
to
issue
the
permit.
that's
the
implication
of
say
you
haven't
shown
it
to
us
because
if
you
would
show
it
to
us,
we'd
find
it
not
offensive
to
the
permits
of
the
ordinance,
then
we
would
grant
you
a
prayer
to
compel
the
commissioner
and
the
mayor
to
issue
that
permit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
now
saying
that
that
was
some
legal
--
i'm
--
i
made
no
reference
what
i
think
about
it.
i'm
merely
concern
with
interpreting
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done.
it
seems
to
me
they've
done
that.
they
said,
"you
--
you
ask
the
district
court
to
compel
the
commissioner
or
the
mayor,"
commissioner
denies
it,
"the
issue
of
permit."
now,
then
can
you
object
that
he
didn't
issue
a
permit?
you
come
in
to
court
and
want
us
to
tell
the
commissioner
to
issue
a
permit.
we
will
issue
a
permit
if
on
seeing
it,
he
see
that
he
should
issue
a
permit.
that's
what
i
get
out
of
the
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
had
supposed
that's
--
i
had
supposed
that's
a
real
complaint
that
under
the
united
states
constitution,
you
can
exhibit
without
a
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
can
exhibit
without
a
license.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
citation
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
count
two
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
am
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
honestly,
i
don't
see
how
if
you
claim
the
ordinance
is
--
is
unconstitutional,
how
that
would
--
how
you'd
only
be
involved
in
the
state
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand.
i
thought
that
was
your
claim
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
state
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
tell
me
how
if
you
were
exhibiting
this
film
tomorrow
and
you
were
directed
or
you
were
brought
in
to
court
for
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
claim
the
invalidity
of
the
scheme
as
an
entirety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
could
you
possibly
not
be
raising
a
federal
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
be
decided
adversely
but
then
you'd
come
up
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
don't
--
if
you're
prosecuted
for
that,
you
--
you
say
you
make
no
objection.
the
controversy
isn't
whether
to
pay
$5
or
$10
or
$3,
whatever
it
is.
the
controversy
is
about
showing
it
without
a
permit.
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
having
paid
$3.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
and
you're
not
in
court
because
you
don't
want
to
pay
the
money,
you're
in
court
because
you
don't
want
to
commit
the
film.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
would
then
answer
that
you
haven't
got
a
permit
because
you
think
the
constitution
of
the
united
state
stage
you
from
having
a
permit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
isn't
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
be,
the
question
is
whether
this
court
with
the
case
that
you
came
here
on
a
prosecution
in
which
you
tendered
the
$3
over
$30
and
they
said,
"we
want
to
see
the
film"
and
you
said,
"i
have
nothing
to
do
with
it."
you
then
showed
it
in
a
prosecutor,
the
first
thing
that
this
one
i'm
considering,
the
presence
is
whether
it
would
be
--
whether
this
court
was
conceivably
vague,
that
if
you
satisfied
your
portions
of
the
ordinance
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
free
speech
trade
that
you
couldn't
come
up
here
to
raise
the
free
speech
trade.
it's
just
not
conceivable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
point.
i
am
saying
that
if
you
did
go
through,
you
could've
raised
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
saying
--
i'm
suggesting
you're
taking
no
risk.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
you
get
many
suits
into
the
federal
court.
we'll
get
the
same
time
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
can
you
say
the
city
isn't
authorizing?the
city
certainly
is
authorizing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
it
isn't
approving
of
it,
i
can
understand
but
when
you
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
exactly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
it's
doing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
they
--
well,
are
you
now
saying
that
what
all
this
(inaudible)
about
is
that
there's
a
presumption
that
your
film
satisfy
--
does
not
offend
the
restriction
of
the
ordinance
and
that
is
any
such
assumption
is
to
be
--
any
such
factor
entered
into
the
situation
and
the
police
commissioner
should
say,
"we
have
very
good
grounds
from
believing
that
this
is
a
dirty
film
and
show
it
to
us."
would
you
think
the
city
was
entitled
to
see
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
the
court
(inaudible)
--
i
should
think
the
court
would
say
but
instead
of
indulging
into
presumptions
one
way
or
another,
why
don't
you
show
it?
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
say
it
would
be
a
different
case
if
the
police
commissioner
said
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i've
had
applied
a
showing
of
it
and
based
on
that,
i
think
i
wanted
to
do
the
film.do
you
think
that
would
be
a
different
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
want
to
raise
this
abstract
question,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
just
stated
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
just
stated
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
an
abstract
proposition,
that
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wanted
to
get
after
this
--
this
question
of
the
dark
and
you
think
that
doesn't
appeal
to
your
reasoning
powers
but
if
the
police
commissioner
had
good
grounds
for
thinking
it
was
dirty,
then
you
think
it
would
be
a
difference
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
near
against
minnesota,
it
was
conceded
that
the
stuff
was
--
was
vicious
stuff
and
the
doctrine
was
laid
down
but
they
can't
have
prior
censorship
of
loose
cases.
therefore,
you,
yourself
have
already
indicated
the
difference
between
films
and
newspapers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
you've
said
there
ought
to
be
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
in
near,
drawing
lines
would
reject
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
in
near,
drawing
line
would
reject
it
with
reference
to
newspapers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
suggestion
if
we've
had
a
different
case.
if
the
police
commissioner
had
good
grounds
for
suspecting
that
this
is
a
dirty
picture
is
not
a
confusing
suggestion
but
a
differentiating
suggestion.
you
say
that
was
different.
you're
saying
kingsley
there
was
a
firm
statement
that
it
is
pornographic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
case
that
that
is
a
very
different
thinking
to
say
we
don't
care
whether
it
is
pornographic.
it
can't
be
the
center
to
begin
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
is,
but
i
say
there's
a
difference
between
inquiring
into
the
question
as
the
basis
of
censorship
and
saying
it's
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
permanent
body
or
ad
hoc?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
it's
relevant
but
i
just
wonder
how
much
american
civilization
has
suffered
through
this
segregation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

if
it
covers
you.
