mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
honorable
members
of
this
court,
i
am
the
special
public
defender
appointed
by
the
superior
court
of
hartford
county
one
year
after
the
trial
of
this
case.
petitioner,
your
honors
please,
is
under
sentence
of
death
for
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
first-degree
on
two
counts,
committed
in
the
course
of
a
robbery.
he
seeks
reversal
of
the
judgement
by
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
the
state
of
connecticut
which
affirmed
the
conviction.
the
petitioner
is
raising
the
issues
in
this
case,
involved
the
admission
of
three
written
confessions
and
one
oral
confession
which
were
taken
as
follows,
one
on
wednesday,
february
27th,
five
days
after
his
apprehension
and
custody.
another,
sunday,
taken
march
3rd,
nine
days
after
his
apprehension
and
three
days
after
he
was
formally
charged
with
murder
and
third,
the
third
one
taken
on
monday,
march
4,
10
days
after
his
apprehension
and
four
days
after
he
was
formally
charged
with
murder.
an
oral
confession
was
taken
on
wednesday
afternoon,
february
27th,
the
day
that
he
gave
the
first
written
confession,
in
the
afternoon.
he
gave
the
oral
confession
in
the
afternoon
and
the
written
confession
late
that
evening
or
in
the
early
morning
hours
of
thursday,
february
28th.
we
claim
that
these
confessions,
all
of
them,
were
coerced
and
involuntary
and
the
latter
two,
namely
the
ones
that
were
pro
--
procured
on
sunday
and
monday
were
not
only
coerced
and
involuntary,
but
were
procured
in
denial
of
counsel
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
undisputed
facts
supporting
these
contentions
are
unequivocally
and
amply
set
forth
in
the
record
and
are
particularly
outlined
in
our
brief
on
a
day-by-day
analysis
as
stated
in
pages
4
through
17
of
our
brief.
it
should
be
noted
and
it
is
very
noteworthy
that
when
the
question
of
voluntariness
is
an
issue
in
a
court
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
prove
that
the
confession
was
not
involuntary.
in
other
words,
the
burden
of
proof
is
not
upon
the
defendant
to
prove
voluntariness,
but
upon
the
state
to
prove
they
were
not
involuntary.
i
think
it
is
well
to
consider,
in
considering
all
of
the
elements
of
coercion
in
this
case
and
this
case
is
a
classic
one,
if
i
have
ever
saw
one,
members
of
this
court,
that
we
are
dealing
here
essentially
with
a
mental
defective,
a
man
who
has
the
mentality
of
a
nine
to
a
nine
and
a
half
year
old
child
with
an
iq
of
60,
with
the
history
of
being
confined
in
two
state
mental
institutions,
the
bridgewater
state
hospital
and
the
wrentham
state
hospital
of
massachusetts
when
he
was
17,
a
man
who
has
been
classified
as
a
moron
when
he
was
33
at
the
time
of
this
crime
and
classified
as
an
imbecile
when
he
was
17,
when
he
was
first
confined
in
the
bridgewater
--
bridgewater
state
hospital.
a
man
whom
the
state
psychiatrist
conceded
as
a
moron
of
a
low
grade
or
middle
grade
caliber
and
a
man
who,
according
to
bertram
p.ibelle,
the
clinical
psychologist
in
this
case,
stated
as
follows.
all
testing
is
consistent
and
indicative
that
this
is
clearly
a
feeble-minded
individual,
whose
adjustment,
both
personal
and
social,
could
at
best
be
marginal.
his
performance
is
that
of
a
middle
grade
moron
and
he
can
be
properly
labeled
moderately
defective.
in
addition
to
being
settled
with
deficient
mental
equipment
with
which
he
must
try
to
cope
with
life's
problems.
mr.
culombe
is
also
possessed
of
that
character
defect
so
frequently
found
in
individuals
of
low
intellectual
caliber,
namely
he
is
enormously
suggestible.
thus,
lacking
in
the
capacity
for
sufficient
critical
judgment,
his
manner
of
thinking,
his
pattern
of
living
and
his
way
of
behaving
can
all
be
easily
influenced
by
those
persons
closest
to
him.
when
the
influences
are
benign,
he
gets
along.
when
the
opposite
obtains,
he
is
in
trouble.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
this
is
--
this
was
given
at
the
course
of
a
trial
by
the
clinical
psychologist,
dr.
bertram
p.ibelle.
a
copy
of
this
examination
by
dr.
ibelle
was
made
at
a
formal
exhibit
in
this
--
in
this
case,
your
honor
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
and
this
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
this
court
may
review
this
exhibit.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
it
was
read
to
the
jury.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
this
is
an
exhibit
and
the
jury
reviewed
this
at
the
course
of
this
trial.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
feeble-minded
individual,
arthur
culombe
is
an
illiterate.
at
the
age
of
16,
he
was
still
in
the
third
grade.
he
was
in
the
third
grade
for
a
period
of
six
years
in
the
special
class.
and
he
progressed
no
further
than
that.
his
mother
stated
in
testimony
in
this
case
that
he
was
mental
according
to
her
--
the
--
the
pediatrician
or
the
baby
doctor,
he
was
mental
from
the
very
beginning
and
i
--
i
recall,
if
i
may,
her
statement,
"but
he
was
a
child,
because
he
used
to
have
these
crying
spells,
he
couldn't
sleep,
then
when
he
got
older,
he
would
stand
up
in
his
crib
and
scream
and
pull
his
hair
and
would
go
in
a
tantrum
and
throw
himself
on
his
stomach
in
the
crib
and
i
would
call
the
doctor
in
the
night
and
the
doctor
told
me,
he
was
mental.
he
had
a
mental
illness."
and
this
is

of
the
record,
if
your
honor
pleases
--
if
your
honors
please.
in
dealing
here
with
a
man
of
this
type,
we
are
now
confronted
with
the
various
cause
of
conduct
of
the
police
in
the
handling
of
this
case,
which
sets
forth
the
situation
of
aggravated
circumstance
that
reminds
me
of
the
florida
case,
the
chambers
versus
florida,
the
fikes
case,
cases
of
lesser
aggravated
circumstance
have
been
reversed
by
this
court.
and
we
have
set
forth
these
facts,
beginning
at
page
4
of
our
brief.
first,
arthur
culombe
was
taken
into
custody,
saturday,
february
23rd,
at
the
state
police.
he
was
taken
for
a
ride
by
three
policemen
through
the
county
of
hartford
and
coventry
and
rocky
hill
and
various
places
around
hartford
for
purposes
of
identification.
after
four
or
five
hours
of
questioning
in
the
car,
he
was
returned
to
the
state
police
barracks,
state
police
headquarters.
there,
he
was
further
questioned.
further,
he
was
again
taken
back
to
his
house
where
he
was
confronted
with
his
wife
and
children.
and
then
he
was
sent
back
into
the
private
car
of
the
police
where
the
sergeant
paige
talked
with
the
--
with
his
wife
while
her
husband
was
waiting
outside
to
be
carried
back
to
the
police
barracks.
when
he
was
returned
to
the
police
barracks
that
evening
at
8
p.m.,
he
was
again
questioned
by
--
by
lieutenant
rome,
who
was
the
chief
protagonist,
who
was
the
leader
of
the
--
of
this
group
of
mass
relay
questioners.
lieutenant
rome
questioned
him
further
and
at
10
o'clock
that
evening
--
evening,
placed
him
under
arrest
without
a
warrant,
under
our
felony
statute.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
these
--
the
facts
that
i
have
recited
are
uncontradicted,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
have
said
this
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
on
saturday,
we
have
ascertained
and
this
is
a
sketchy
record,
the
record
is
not
complete,
if
your
honors
please.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
the
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
it
was
--
it
isn't
clear
in
the
record
as
to
the
exact
amounts
of
time,
the
precise
number
of
hours
that
he
was
questioned.
we
can
approximate
it
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
it
is.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
yes,
mr.
justice.
on
saturday
afternoon,
they
were
questioned
for
--
he
was
questioned
for
two
to
three
and
a
half
hours
by
officers
paige,
griffin
and
moran
and
it
was
that
time,
they
were
going
in
the
police
car
and
they
have
a
bottle
of
whiskey
with
them,
which
the
police
permitted
the
other
suspect
taborsky
and
mr.
culombe
to
drink
from.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
one
can't
tell
whether
it's
two
or
three
hours,
we
could
only
infer.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
oh,
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
oh,
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that
because
they
were
riding
around
in
the
car
for
a
certain
period
of
time
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
whether
or
not,
they
were
to
--
were
--
were
questioning
culombe,
the
particular
petitioner
at
this
time,
throughout
that
period,
it
cannot
be
ascertained
but
it
may
be
reasonably
inferred
that
he
was
questioned
together
with
the
co-suspect
here,
mr.
taborsky.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
there
was
a
bottle
of
whiskey
which
mr.
taborsky
was
permitted
to
have
and
co-suspect
here.
he
brought
it
with
him
in
the
back
of
the
car
and
the
--
the
three
policemen
permitted
both
mr.
taborsky
and
the
petitioner
to
share
that
bottle
of
whiskey
while
they
were
being
questioned
and
taken
about
in
that
car
during
that
afternoon.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
don't
think
the
record
is
clear
but
i
--
it
maybe
reasonably
inferred
that
they
drank
the
entire
bottle.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
think
it
was
a
large
bottle,
quart
size.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
it
was
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
taborsky
had
it
with
him
and
they
did
not
remove
it
from
his
possession.
they've
permitted
him
to
--
permitted
both
of
the
suspects
to
--
to
imbibe
the
liquid.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
that
was
throughout
a
period
of
two
to
three
and
a
half
hours
while
they
were
going
around
in
the
car
that
afternoon
in
rocky
hill
and
coventry
in
the
county
of
hartford.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
pardon?
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
at
--
they
were
later
taken
--
after
culombe
was
later
taken
to
headquarters
where
he
was
further
questioned
by
rome
that
evening
after
they
returned
from
their
trip
in
the
county.
he
was
questioned
for
a
period
of
an
hour
and
a
half
to
two
hours
that
evening
by
lieutenant
rome.
he
was
also
questioned
by
sergeant
paige,
rome's
immediate
assistant,
over
one
hour
that
evening.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
in
addition
to
these
three
and
a
half
--
two
to
three
and
half
hours
of
questioning
in
the
afternoon.
he
was
also
questioned
for
a
period
of
one
to
three
hours
by
other
police.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
that
evening.
they
were
not
able
to
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
they're
overlapping
--
overlapping
because
the
other
co-suspect
taborsky
was
also
questioned
at
the
same
time.
and
they
were
questioning
him
back
and
forth
in
different
rooms,
one
officer
would
come
out
of
one
room,
the
--
and
then
come
to
culombe
and
then
check
the
other
way.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
it
was
a
cross
relay
system.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
he
was
returned
to
headquarters
about
6
o'clock.
they
had
--
he
had
dinner
with
the
state
policemen
and
they
questioned
him
during
that
time,
also
during
the
dinner.
and
then
he
was
returned
to
headquarters
and
he
was
questioned
intermittently
throughout
that
evening
until
midnight
when
he
finally
went
to
bed.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i'm
trying
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
in
giving
a
precise
detailed
breakdown
of
the
questioning.
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
and
we
take
this
position
that
he
was
intermittently
questioned
from
2:30
that
afternoon
to
12
midnight
for
a
period
of
approximately
nine
hours.
the
precise
number
of
hours
that
each
particular
officer
questioned
them,
we're
not
able
to
ascertain
from
the
record.
he
was
formally
arrested
according
to
lieutenant
rome
at
10
p.m.
that
evening
without
a
warrant,
although
the
state
police
log,
which
is
the
ordinary
means
by
which
we
have
an
objective
record
of
such
an
arrest,
without
a
warrant,
makes
no
mention
of
any
arrest
of
arthur
culombe
or
the
co-suspect
in
this
case.
it
is
absolutely
silent
of
any
arrest
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
so
that
we
have
no
objective
record,
other
than
the
statement
of
lieutenant
rome,
of
the
exact
time
of
arrest
or
whether
or
not,
in
fact,
arthur
culombe
was
arrested
in
this
case
without
a
warrant.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
2:30
that
afternoon.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
until
midnight.
it
--
intermittent
hours,
whether
or
not
that
was
continuos,
i
am
not
able
to
state
and
probably,
it
was
not
continuos
because
the
co-suspect
was
also
questioned.
but
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
close
to
nine
hours
of
questioning
that
day.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
was
arrested
--
he
was
arrested
10
o'clock
that
evening
at
the
state
police
barracks
where
he
was
continuously
held
throughout
that
evening
after
he
was
returned
from
the
trip
and
from
his
house,
where
he
was
taken
by
sergent
rome.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
was
placed
in
custody
of
the
police,
under
the
influence
of
the
police.
he
was
formally
arrested
according
to
lieutenant
rome
at
10
p.m.
that
evening
in
the
state
supreme
court
and
it
was
finding
of
the
trial
judge
so
held.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
was
formally
arrested
on
the
suspicion
of
felony,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
they
filed
no
compliant.
there
was
no
complaint
filed.
all
there
was
is
"we
hereby
arrest
you."
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
there
wasn't
even
a
booking.
there's
no
record
of
any
arrest
at10
p.m.
that
evening.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
oral
testimony
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
was
arrested
that
hour,
although,
as
i
say,
there's
no
objective
evidence
of
that
fact.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
that
was
never
clarified
and
the
record
merely
stated
that
he
was
arrested
at
10
p.m.
that
evening.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
pardon?
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
the
co-defendant
has
since
been
electrocuted.
may
--
may,
last
year,
he
was
electrocuted.
he
refused
to
appeal
his
case,
contrary
to
the
advice
of
his
counsel.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
did
not
want
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
did
appeal
to
the
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
supreme
court
of
errors
but
he
did
not
want
to.
it
was
against
his
--
his
counsel,
as
i
understand,
was
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
was
represented
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
and
--
but
as
i
understand,
he
did
not
want
to
take
any
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
errors
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
he
has
a
death
wish
according
to
his
psychiatrist,
and
he
wanted
to
die
and
the
state
let
him
die.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no.
actually,
his
counsel,
and
i
think
he's
present
in
the
courtroom
today,
wanted
to
take
an
appeal
to
this
court
on
certiorari
but
he
was
against
it.
his
client
did
not
want
to
take
an
appeal
by
certiorari
and
wanted
to
die
and
he
was
electrocuted
last
may.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
had
also
counsel
special
--
special
public
defender
appointed
by
the
superior
court.
he
had
--
he
had
--
the
special
public
defender
was
appointed
the
superior
court
as
was
mr.
mcdonough
and
i
was
for
arthur
culombe.
he
was
appointed
by
the
superior
court.
the
reason
being
that
both
defendants
here
were
involved
in
a
--
allegedly
involved
in
a
series
of
many
crimes
and
it
was
felt
and
neither
of
which
wanted
to
have
the
public
defender
represent
them,
neither
of
whom
wanted
the
public
defender
represent
them
and
therefore,
the
court,
recognizing
the
gravity
of
these
crimes,
appointed
special
public
defenders
to
represent
them.
i
am
representing
the
petitioner
here.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
it
is
not
a
public
office,
it
--
there
is
a
public
office
of
public
defender
in
the
state
of
connecticut
but
apparently,
he
did
not
want
the
public
defender
who
is
the
official
functionary
of
this
office
to
represent
him.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
in
--
in
effect,
it
is
assigned
counsel
and
--
but
--
however,
we
referred
--
we
were
referred
to
special
public
defenders
because
this
was
the
expressed
wish
--
expressed
wish
of
the
petitioner
--
the
clients
involved.
they
did
not
want
the
public
attorney
to
represent
them.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
mr.
mcdonough,
attorney
mcdonough
defended
him.
but
attorney
mcdonough
had
brought
me
in
as
assistant
counsel
on
matters
of
constitutional
questions
of
law,
which
i
assisted
in.
i
was
present
about
10%
of
the
trial
proceeding.
the
trial
took
about
two
and
a
half
to
three
months
in
total.
the
venue
--
the
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
two
and
a
half
to
three
months,
five
weeks
of
which
was
spent
in
gathering
a
jury.
and
at
one
time,
they
were
discharged
on
mass,
the
jury
panel
because
of
a
defective
arraignment.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
precisely.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
precisely.
and
this
is
--
this
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
manner
in
which
the
police
handled
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
pardon?
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
no.
we
--
we
did
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
that
is
the
--
the
gravamen
of
the
crimes
there.
you
see,
they
were
referred
to
as
the
mad
dog
killers
in
the
press
throughout
the
--
throughout
the
state.
and
the
public
was
aroused
as
evidenced
by
the
mobs
which
had
gathered
outside
of
the
new
britain
courtroom,
new
britain
police
station.
and
the
new
britain
courtroom
on
tuesday,
which
placed
arthur
culombe
in
tremendous
fear,
that
matters
he
testified.
there
were
some
references
made
that
this
is
a
lynch
mob
and
--
and
the
people
in
new
britain
were
aroused
by
this
because
this
is
where
the
scenes
of
the
two
murders
took
place.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
sunday
is
a
rather
--
difficult
to
ascertain
the
particular
times.
they
are
difficult
to
determine
according
to
the
transcript
involved.
however,
we
do
know
the
particular
officers
who
did
question
the
petitioner
on
that
day.
he
was
questioned
the
afternoon
by
sergent
paige
for
undeterminable
period
of
time.
he
was
questioned
also
by
rome
during
that
--
lieutenant
rome,
during
the
--
during
that
afternoon
and
by
a
hartford
detective
during
that
afternoon.
and
he
was
questioned
again
in
the
later
part
of
the
afternoon,
the
evening
by
detective
paige.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
this
is
on
sunday
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
mr
justice
--
chief
justice.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
approximately
--
well,
it
was
intermittently,
we
would
say,
for
a
period
of
two
to
three
hours
that
he
was
questioned
during
that
day.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
sometime
in
the
afternoon
and
evening.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
through
the
police
themselves?
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
the
state
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
and
there
were
some
confusion
as
to
what
days
we
were
talking
about
in
the
course
of
the
cross-examination
by
attorney
mcdonough
and
attorney
burke
who
represented
the
co-suspect.
now,
on
monday,
petitioner,
we
claim,
was
questioned
for
a
period
at
least,
four
to
seven
hours.
he
was
brought
upstairs
from
his
cell
at
state
police
headquarters
and
mind
you,
gentlemen,
he
is
still
confined
at
the
state
police
barracks.
he
has
not
been
taken
to
any
jail.
he's
still
under
the
influence
and
domination
of
the
police.
at
that
day,
he
was
promised
counsel
by
lieutenant
rome,
promised
counsel
for
his
appearance
in
--
supposedly
his
appearance
that
day
in
some
--
in
--
in
new
britain
court.
but
apparently,
they
did
not
get
--
have
time
to
take
him
to
new
britain
court
that
day
because
they
were
fingerprinting
him
all
afternoon,
taking
pictures
and
photographs
were
being
taken
of
him
by
reporters
in
new
britain
at
that
time
when
he
was
finally
taken
to
new
britain.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
it's
--
this
new
britain
--
this
is
new
britain
police
station
we're
talking
about
now.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
and
the
state
police
admit
that
they
had
delayed
in
presenting
him
that
day
because
they
wanted
further
time
to
question
him.
so
they
didn't
present
him
until
the
following
day,
tuesday,
before
the
new
britain
police
court,
which
is
a
mockery
of
court
procedure.
he
was
neither
arraigned,
he
was
not
spoken
to
by
the
judge,
he
was
placed
in
a
cage
at
the
rear
of
the
police
station
on
tuesday
--
of
the
court
on
tuesday.
his
vision
was
obscured,
his
hearing
--
he
was
unable
to
hear
what
the
judge
had
said.
and
he
wasn't
--
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
formal
complaint
issued,
so
far
as
i
understand,
other
than
a
breach
of
peace
and
technical
charge
of
breach
of
the
peace
and
he
was
placed
on
$25,000
bond.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
committee
magistrate,
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
was
--
was
not
bound
over.
the
case
has
continued
for
one
week
of
that
day.
he
was
held
on
a
technical
--
technical
charge
of
breach
of
the
peace
at
$25,000
bond
and
then
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
was
--
he
was
arrested
--
he
was
arrested
with
felony
charge
but
felony
charge
was
never
prosecuted
in
the
county.
they
put
him
on
--
placed
him
on
a
specious
charge
of
breach
of
peace
and
he
was
to
be
held
at
$25,000
bond.
but
more
significantly,
the
court
issued
a
mittimus
stating
and
directing
that
he'd
be
taken
immediately
forthwith
to
the
hartford
county
jail
and
this
mittimus
is
a
matter
of
record
here.
we
pointed
down
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
which
this
court
may
review.
the
mittimus
directed
that
he'd
be
sent
to
the
hartford
county
jail,
which
it
was
not
done.
instead
of
taking
him
to
the
hartford
county
jail,
they
took
him
back
to
state
police
barracks
and
questioned
him
further
until
that
early
evening
for
at
least
a
period
of
eight
hours.
and
then
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
the
courtroom
was
mobbed
with
people.
he
was
placed
in
a
--
an
iron
cage
in
the
rear
of
the
courtroom,
he
and
the
co-suspect.
his
vision
was
obscured.
there
were
people
standing
in
front
of
that
cage.
he
--
they're
rumbling
photographs
and
flashbulbs
and
television
cameras,
according
to
his
statement
were
--
were
talking
pictures
of
him.
he
was
like
a
monkey
in
a
cage.
and
he
was
treated
like
an
animal
there
and
there
was
no
--
he
didn't
hear
what
was
going
on.
there
were
some
private
conversation
going
on
between
the
prosecutor
and
lieutenant
rome
and
the
other
state
police.
and
the
judge,
according
to
him,
was
mumbling
some
words,
which
he
didn't
understand
what's
going
on.
and
he
--
he
was
completely
inaudible
to
him
and
all
he
found
out
later
on
was
that
--
that
he
was
being
held
on
a
breach
of
peace
charge,
technical
charge
of
breach
of
peace
at
$25,000
bond.
and
that's
all
that
we
know.
the
record
is
not
--
is
specific
as
to
issue
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
it's
conceded
there
were
mobs
of
people
there.
it's
conceded
that
some
pictures
were
taken
by
the
state.
they
--
they
had
--
the
state
has
admitted
there
were
people
there,
meleeing
all
over
the
court.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
whether
or
not,
they
are
conceding
that
television
cameras
were
there
but
they
had
certainly
flashbulbs,
a
couple
of
flashbulbs,
according
to
lieutenant
rome.
he
minimizes
the
effect
of
it
--
of
all
of
these
but
we
--
we
consider
it
a
mockery
of
court
procedure.
certainly
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
that
is
undisputed.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
that
is
undisputed,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
pardon?
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
it
was
the
usual
cage
where
they
confine
prisoners
who
were
recalcitrant,
i
assume.
i
--
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
think
it's
portable.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
think
it's
a
fixture
of
the
--
of
the
premises.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
it's
a
permanent
cage.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i'm
not
familiar
within
the
new
britain
police
court,
your
honor.
i
practice
law
in
the
city
of
hartford.
i've
never
practiced
before
the
new
britain
police
court
and
i
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
there
is
a
--
well,
in
--
in
the
hartford
police
court,
there
is
an
adjoining
room
where
one
is
confined.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
in
the
courtroom
itself,
yes.
there
is
in
the
superior
court
a
bronze
cage,
a
metal
cage.
in
the
superior
court,
the
higher
court,
where
prisoners
are
confined,
is
called
the
pen,
the
prisoner's
pen.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
the
trial
court
here
is
the
superior
court.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
this
is
a
lower
court,
a
minor
court.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
that
is
not
the
practice.
in
fact,
the
--
the
practices
that
the
defendant
appear
at
a
table,
to
stand
before
a
table,
before
the
bench
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
that
he
not
be
separated
from
the
bench
by
any
sort
of
artificial
means
such
as
a
cage
as
in
this
instance.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
precisely.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
there
was
no
counsel
in
this
case
provided
him,
nor
were
his
constitutional
rights,
nor
was
he
warned
of
his
constitutional
rights
by
the
trial
judge.
he
didn't
know
what
was
going
on.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
he
was
not.
he
was
sitting
with
his
counsel
and
myself
in
back
of
him.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
there
was
nothing
that
went
--
that
transpired,
at
least
that
he
could
hear.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
i
wouldn't
call
it
an
arraignment,
your
honor.
i
would
call
it
an
--
an
abortive
presentment.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
nothing
transpired.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
oh,
yes,
he
was
in
--
he
was
removed
from
the
police
court,
instead
of
being
directed
taken
to
the
hartford
county
jail,
where
the
mittimus
directed
that
he
be
taken
to
forthwith,
he
was
questioned
for
a
period
of
eight
hours.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
precisely.
precisely,
your
honor.
this
is
one
of
the
factors
which
--
this
is
one
of
the
further
evidences
of
the
kind
of
police
methods
that
were
used
in
this
case,
the
kind
of
police
activity.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
goldfard.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
attention
to
page
24
of
the
respondent's
brief
in
which
he
admits,
state
admits
that
petitioner
was
moderately
defective
and
of
a
classification
of
middle
or
high
grade
moron.
but
more
particularly,
it's
significant
that
the
state
police
officers
and
the
state
concedes
it's
new
or
were
told
by
the
petitioner
that
he
was
feeble-minded
on
that
day,
saturday,
the
first
day
that
he
took
--
they
took
him
into
custody.
so
that
they
knew
that
this
was
a
mental
defective
from
the
very
day
they
--
they
took
him
into
--
under
their
influence.
and
further,
the
state
concedes
at
page
26
that
the
accused
was
subjected
to
extended
time
for
questioning,
on
page
26
of
the
third
paragraph
of
the
respondent's
brief.
so
there
is
a
concession
by
the
state
that
there's
been
at
least
an
extensive
period
of
questioning
although
it
related
to
other
crimes.
now,
on
that
tuesday
when
the
state
had
violated
the
mittimus
and
not
taken
the
accused
back
to
the
hartford
--
back
to
the
hartford
county
jail
as
directed
by
court
order,
during
that
entire
period,
they
subjected
him
to
intermittent
periods
of
questioning.
and
two,
when
they
brought
him
back
to
the
state
police
barracks
that
afternoon
or
early
evening,
they
brought
his
wife
and
two
minor
children,
a
thirteen-year-old
child
and
a
five-year-old
child
to
state
police
headquarters.
and
as
there
--
as
--
as
the
state
police
officer,
lieutenant
rome
stated
in
the
record,
and
this
is
admitted
by
the
state,
"mr.
mcdonough
interrogating
--
cross
interrogating
mr.
--
lieutenant
rome,
you
also
testified
yesterday,
mr.
rome,
the
reason
you
brought
mrs.
culombe
to
the
headquarters
was
to
use
her
as
another
way
of
getting
confession."
lieutenant
rome,
"yes,
sir."
"and
did
you
expect
to
use
her
on
taborsky
too?"
"if
i
could,"
he
answered.
"if
you
could,
what
other
means
or
ways
did
you
use
on
taborsky?
did
you
use
his
mother?"
answer,
"you
could
interpret
it
that
way,"
and
that
was
the
fact.
they
used
his
mother
to
get
a
confession
from
the
co-suspect,
joseph
taborsky.
not
only
that
and
this
is
undisputed,
the
thirteen-year-old
minor
child
had
confessed
to
some
private
conversation
held
between
her
father
and
the
co-suspect
taborsky
in
their
home
sometime
previous,
about
a
month
or
two
previous.
state
police
used
the
confession
of
that
minor
child,
had
the
minor
thirteen-year-old
minor
child
into
disgusting
and
humiliating
episode,
confront
her
father
with
that
very
statement,
the
very
confession
that
she
made.
and
the
essence
of
that
statement
is
at
page
--
it's
in
the
transcript
in
which
the
state
does
not
deny.
"you
do
recall,"
mr.
mcdonough
says
recalling
the
thirteen
or
fourteen-year-old
child
over
to
the
door
and
saying,
"honey,
tell
your
father
what
you
told
us,
don't
you?"
the
answer
of
the
--
of
lieutenant
rome,
"i
could
have
said
that."
in
addition
to
the
use
of
the
wife
and
children,
there
was
the
five-year-old
child
who
was
also
taken
to
the
police
headquarters
and
she
was
brought
there
because
she
was
sick.
and
they
claim
--
the
state
claims
that
the
mother
didn't
want
to
leave
the
five-year-old
child
alone.
nevertheless,
the
two
children
were
brought
to
the
police
station
with
the
mother
against
her
will,
culombe
knew
this.
culombe
knew
also
that
--
that
his
five-year-old
child
was
sick.
this
warred
--
wore
upon
him,
this
depressed
him,
this
demoralized
him.
and
later
on
that
evening
or
the
following
day,
the
five-year-old
child
had
to
be
dispatched
to
a
hospital
from
state
police
headquarters.
there's
no
question
about
this
fact
because
it
had
the
mumps.
that
was
tuesday.
now,
the
--
they
finished
questioning
him
until
about
8:50
that
evening.
according
to
the
state
police,
he
was
a
sorry
sight
after
that.
"he
had
gone
through
an
ordeal,"
said
sergeant
paige,
an
ordeal
he
was
subjected
through
--
to.
he
was
a
sorry
sight.
the
following
day
on
wednesday,
culombe
was,
again,
illegally
borrowed
from
the
--
from
the
hartford
county
jail.
he
was
sent
back
the
previous
evening
to
the
jail,
eight
hours
after
the
court
had
directed
he'd
be
sent
for
with
--
forthwith
to
the
jail
the
previous
day.
on
wednesday,
again,
they
illegally
borrowed
him
from
a
hartford
county
jail
and
the
trial
judge
so
found
specifically
in
the
course
of
this
trial
that
he
was
illegally
borrowed
so
far
as
the
removal
from
the
jail
was
concerned.
and
i
refer
--
respectfully
refer
your
honors
to
page
952
of
the
record
for
that
reference
in
which
the
trial
judge
found
that
he
was
illegally
borrowed.
having
supported
him
from
the
hartford
county
jail,
they
took
him
and
kept
him
in
his
custody
until
the
confession
was
elicited
from
him
early
that
--
later
that
evening
or
until
the
morning
hours
at
12:30
a.m.
of
thursday
the
following
day.
he
was
intensively
questioned
from
1:30
p.m.
on
wednesday
until
the
early
hours
of
thursday
morning
when
he
finally
signed
the
confession
in
which
he
did
--
admitted
being
present
at
the
time
the
robbery
but
denied
any
killing.
now,
the
questioning
period
on
wednesday
was
about
--
was
--
was
--
and
there
was
an
oral
confession
that
wednesday
afternoon
to
which
he
had
committed
--
which
he
admitted
practically
the
same
thing
that
he
did
that
wednesday,
that
following
thursday
morning
in
which
four
officers
were
present,
o'brien,
rome,
paige
and
murphy.
he
was
questioned
previous
to
that
by
rome,
murphy
and
paige
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
that
afternoon
and
for
three
hours
while
driving
around
on
--
on
wednesday
afternoon
by
o'brien,
rome,
paige
and
murphy
where
he
gave
his
oral
confession.
he
was
further
questioned
by
rome
and
officer
remer
and
kelly
for
an
--
for
half
hour
to
an
hour
early
that
evening
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening,
he
was
questioned
by
rome,
paige,
matus,
o'brien
for
a
period
of
four
and
a
half
to
five
hours
until
about
12:30
or
1
a.m.
the
following
morning
on
thursday.
five
days
after
he
was
taken
into
custody,
he
finally
confessed,
subjected
to
sustain
the
prolonged
interrogation,
illegal
procedures
by
the
police,
delaying
tactics
by
the
police
and
presently
before
committee
judge,
use
of
the
wife
and
the
two
--
and
the
two
minor
children
in
order
to
get
a
confession.
and
furthermore,
the
confession
was
not
in
the
language
of
the
accused
who
could
neither
write
nor
speak
the
--
neither
read
nor
write
the
english
language.
it
is
totally
in
the
language
of
lieutenant
rome.
lieutenant
rome
wouldn't
ask
him
a
question,
culombe
would
answer
the
question,
he
would
paraphrase
the
answer,
composed
it
in
his
own
language,
in
his
own
syntax,
in
his
own
set
of
structure
and
we
have
here
the
wednesday
night
confession,
exhibit
z1
for
identification.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
z1
for
identification
was
not
used
in
evidence.
it
was
incorporated
by
reference
in
exhibit
z,
the
monday
morning
confession.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
the
wednesday
night
confession,
the
first
confession
to
which
we've
just
related
all
of
these
circumstances,
was
not
admitted
as
a
full
exhibit.
it
was
admitted
for
purposes
of
identi
--
for
identification
only
but
was
incorporated
by
--
by
reference
verbatim
in
the
monday
confession.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
exhibit
z
--
excuse
me.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
exhibit
z1
for
identification,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
contained
matters
relating
to
other
than
the
particular
crimes
involved
in
this
trial.
therefore,
the
state
saw
fit
to
exclude
those
matters
and
rewrite
that
confession
and
submit
it
to
the
accused
on
monday
10
--
monday,
march
4th,
after
his
trial
counsel
had
--
after
his
--
the
court
had
already
appointed
his
counsel
and
incorporated
only
in
that
monday
confession
those
matters
which
pertained
exclusively
to
the
new
britain
matter,
the
new
britain
crimes
as
in
this
instance.
they
had
excluded
all
other
immaterial
matters
because
as
--
as
the
state
says,
it
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
accused
to
have
admitted
that
entire
confession
pertaining
to
unrelated
crimes.
at
the
time
the
monday
confession
was
taken,
however,
and
we
submit
and
the
--
and
the
evidence
is
undisputed,
the
court
on
thursday
had
appointed
a
special
public
defendant,
the
superior
court,
mr.
attorney
mcdonough
to
represent
him
without
notifying
his
court-appointed
counsel,
without
advising
him
to
be
present,
lieutenant
rome
and
another
officer
--
four
office
--
another
officer
went
to
the
hartford
county
jail
and
approached
the
accused
and
told
him
that
--
and
told
him
after
the
accused
had
asked
them,
"where
is
my
attorney?"
he
says
--
he
reassured
him
to
worst
to
the
effect,
"it
was
okayed
by
--
by
your
attorney,"
which
was
a
misrepresentation
of
fact
because
his
attorney
was
never
even
notified
of
this,
was
never
advised
that
they
intended
to
take
this
statement
from
him
on
that
monday.
in
fact,
he
--
the
day
previous,
he
had
learned
that
they
have
taken
the
second
confession
from
him
on
sunday
and
he
warned
the
police
to
remove
him
from
the
state
police
barracks
and
take
him
to
the
hartford
county
jail
and
then
specifically
instructed
lieutenant
rome
to
leave
him
alone
and
not
to
bother
him.
and
lieutenant
rome
admitted
on
the
stand
that
he
specifically
and
explicitly
disregarded
attorney
mcdonough's,
the
court-appointed
counsel's
instructions,
explicitly
disregarded
them
because
he
felt
he
could
do
better
without
him,
as
he
said
--
and
because
he
felt,
as
lieutenant
rome
said,
he
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
notify
attorney
mcdonough
of
his
approaching
the
accused
and
asking
him
for
--
for
having
him
sign
the
statements.
so
i
think
clearly,
this
is
the
denial
of
counsel
under
the
due
process
clause.
certainly,
he
had
a
--
a
right
to
counsel
after
thursday
when
he
was
first
accused
of
a
crime,
thursday
of
that
week
in
--
in
a
bench
warrant
which
is
issued
against
him.
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
after
that.
the
court
recognized
it
by
appointing
attorney
mcdonough
to
counsel.
i'm
not
claiming
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
preliminary
to
thursday.
before
that
time,
he
lacked
counsel,
he
requested
it
before
that
time
before
thursday
but
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
because
the
court
had
appointed
him
on
friday
or
saturday
of
that
day.
and
by
the
police
not
notifying
attorney
mcdonough,
and
the
state
concedes
they
didn't
notify
him,
the
state
concedes
that
--
that
attorney
mcdonough
wasn't
present
at
both
times
when
the
accused
was
--
when
two
or
more
confessions
were
elicited
the
accused,
although
i
think
as
a
matter
of
right,
he
was
entitled
to
had
his
lawyer
there
at
that
time.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
nevertheless,
he
wasn't
present
and
particularly
on
monday,
they
used
the
deceit
comparable
to
the
deceit
of
the
spano
case
to
secure
the
confession
from
the
mentally
defective
tractable
accused.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
--
he
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
had
counsel
on
sunday
and
monday.
he
did
not
have
counsel
on
--
prior
to
--
prior
to
friday.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
it
was
a
sham
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
it
was
a
sham
appoint
--
until
the
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
if
the
appointment
of
--
counsel
--
if
the
police
did
not
notify
his
counsel
of
their
intent
to
secure
the
confessions
from
him.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
that's
correct,
mr.
justice.
they
claim
--
the
state
police
--
the
police
claimed
that
he
--
they
would've
afforded
him
counsel
earlier
--
earlier
to
thursday
if
he
had
specified
the
name
of
a
counsel
before
that
time
but
he
couldn't
--
he
says
he
could've
picked
up
the
telephone
book
and
called
his
counsel
if
he
had
one,
according
to
lieutenant
rome.
but
of
course,
he
can't
read
the
telephone
book
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
in
connecticut?
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
if
he
is
not
indigent,
he
has
the
right.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
this
is
a
very
unusual
case.
it
was
a
very
unusual
circumstance
by
which
special
public
defenders
were
appointed
in
this
case
because
of
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
the
gravamen
of
the
crimes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
other
circumstance.
in
fact,
there
was
a
case
which
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
involving
this
very
point,
your
honor,
and
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
rejected
this
--
this
other
party
who
was
also
tried
at
the
same
time
that
this
trial
took
place,
insisted
that
he'd
be
given
other
special
counsel
like
taborsky
and
culombe
but
the
court
refused
it.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
of
course,
if
the
public
defender
were
provided
the
accused
here
on
wednesday
or
the
days
previous
as
they
are
--
as
they
are
--
as
they
could
have
done,
certainly,
in
new
britain
and
certainly,
on
thursday
before
he
was
remanded
by
the
state
police,
the
public
defender
could've
represented
him
there
at
that
time
but
he
wasn't
called
and
because
according
to
custom,
the
public
defender
only
defends
when
at
the
time
of
trial
and
not
prior
to
trial
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
he
is.
he
is
appointed
by
the
judiciary
of
the
state,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
think
he
--
he
is
--
he's--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
stand
alone.
and
i
think
he's
a
practicing
lawyer
at
the
same
time.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
it's
difficult
to
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
as
i
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
as
understand
it,
it
was
only
five
days,
five
days
after
questioning
on
wednesday.
where
thursday,
he
was
finally
presented
before
the
superior
court
and
the
superior
court
--
the
--
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag,
he
had
already
confessed
once
orally
the
day
previous
and
that
early
morning,
he'd
already
confessed
so
the
state
concludes
that
he
was
cooperative
as
a
result
of
that.
well,
this
was
a
--
like
a
whipped
dog,
a
man
who
had
already
confessed,
he
--
he'd
given
--
he
--
he
was
a
sorry
sight
according
to
state
police.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
oh,
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
on
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
on
thursday,
he
was
caused
to
confront
taborsky,
a
man
whom
he
feared,
a
man
who
dominated
him
in
the
course
of
all
of
his
troubles,
a
man
who
dominated
him
in
the
--
in
the
perpetration
of
these
crimes,
supple
and
tractable
as
this
petitioner
was.
taborsky
confronted
him
at
this
place
immediately
--
in
immediate
fear
because
this
is
a
man
who
feared
not
only
his
own
life
in
relationship
to
taborsky
but
for
the
--
for
his
wife
and
family
because
as
he
testified,
taborsky
warned
him
that
if
he
ever
confessed,
he
would
take
it
out
on
him
and
if
not
him,
then
certainly
his
wife
and
family.
so
this
put
him
in
a
state
of
apprehension
by
forcing
him
to
confront
taborsky
on
thursday
of
that
day.
on
friday,
as
i
stated,
his
counsel
was
finally
appointed
by
the
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
they
continued
to
question
him
on
thursday
as
--
as
my
brief
points
out,
your
honor.
i'm
not
as
extensive
as
it
was
previous,
not
as
sustained
and
prolonged.
the
real
sustained
and
prolonged
questioning
took
place
prior
to
the
wednesday
night
or
early
thursday
morning
confession.
thereafter,
he
was
completely
cooperative
of
the
state
as
the
state
rightly
said
that
he
was
cooperative
but
they
confound
his
cooperativeness
with
his
simplemindedness.
this
is
a
man
with
an
iq
of
60
so
he's
--
he's
going
to
--
he's
going
to
tell
anything
he
wants.
he's
already
given
away
the
answer
to
their
questions.
now,
he's
--
on
saturday,
he
was
subjected
to
a
two-hour
examination
by
the
states
prior
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
friday,
the
court
had
appointed
his
counsel
on
friday,
your
honors.
and
on
friday,
there
--
we
have
no
evidence
of
any
questioning
on
friday.
on
saturday,
however,
a
state-appointed
doctor,
a
psychiatrist
performed
a
two-hour
examination
of
culombe
in
which
they
testified
they
were
asking
him
constant
questions
for
two
hours.
and
he
remained
in
the
state
police
headquarters
where
--
throughout
his
eight-day
of
confinement
on
saturday.
he
was
restless
and
nervous
according
to
the
police.
and
finally
at
10
o'clock
that
night,
he
already
admitted
to
the
state
policemen,
to
state
guard,
his
guard,
officer
biersch
(ph)
that
he
killed
the
service
station
attendants
--
attendant
which
is
at
variance
with
his
earlier
confession
in
which
he
said
that
taborsky
had
killed
both
attendants,
both
parties
to
this
case.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
he
admitted
the
murder
in
the
written
confession
on
wednesday.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
he
did
--
this
is
the
first
statement
in
which
he
admitted
having
committed
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
murder,
that
is
the
killing
itself.
he
was
previously
--
he
admitted
that
he
was
an
accessory.
now,
this
is
the
first
time,
eight
days
after
the
--
his
original
taking
into
custody
in
which
he
admitted
that
he
killed
one
of
the
two
parties.
now,
this
is
at
variance
with
the
two
--
the
other
confession,
not
of
the
--
the
confession
taken
wednesday
night
but
at
variance
with
the
confession
taken
on
monday.
now,
the
following
morning,
on
sunday
morning,
the
police
of
county
having
heard
about
this,
had
the
confession
typed
up
in
the
same
manner
as
the
previous
confession
composed,
syntax-wise,
grammar-wise
in
the
language
of
--
in
the
method
of
--
of
lieutenant
rome
and
he
was
further
questioned
that
afternoon.
he
was
--
that
afternoon,
they
typed
up
the
other
statement
excluding
the
immaterial
or
irrelevant
matters
of
wednesday
previous.
in
the
following
morning,
lieutenant
rome
and
another
officer
approached
culombe
and
told
him
that
it
was
okayed
by
his
attorney.
he'd
asked
them,
"what
about
my
attorney,"
he
said
and
according
to
culombe's
own
statement,
he
said
it
was
okayed
by
him.
and
in
reliance
on
that
statement
or
representation
of
culombe,
lieutenant
rome
has
said,
"mcdonough
knows
about,"
i
quote,
"mcdonough
knows
about
this
and
i
guess
it
is
alright."
in
reality
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
culombe's
attorney
knew
nothing
about
nor
approved
such
an
action
and
for
that
--
for
that
matter,
it
was
indirect
disregard
of
attorney
mcdonough's
specific
instructions
to
leave
his
client
alone
and
not
to
bother
him.
and
lieutenant
rome
said,
"well,
i
--
i
interpreted
not
to
bothering
him
as
not
to
interrogating
him."
and
he
admitted,
lieutenant
rome
admitted
that
he
specifically
--
specifically
disregarded
his
instructions.
and
this
is
the
sorted
series
of
events
that
occurred
in
this
case.
singly,
any
one
of
these
factors
would
be
justification
for
reversal
but
jointly
and
communicatively,
these
factors
set
forth
a
situation
which
is
so
corrupt
with
constitutional
error,
though
i
think
that
this
court
has
no
alternative
but
to
reverse
this
particular
judgment
and
finding
of
guilt.
i
would
like
to
reserve
additional
time
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
for
any
reply
brief
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
in
my
rebuttal
to
the
state.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
thank
you.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
if
your
honors
please,
i
think
in
my
reply
brief,
i
have
disposed
of
the
issue
of
the
question
of
the
orthodox
rule
versus
the
new
york
or
new
york
rule
as
justice
harlan
has
spoken
of.
there's
no
question
that
this
came
up.
this
question,
i
believe,
came
up
in
the
argument
of
the
rogers
case
before
this
very
court
last
month
and
it
was
the
position
of
the
state's
attorney
for
fairfield
county
at
least
that
connecticut
describes
to
the
orthodox
rule.
and
whether
or
not
mr.
labelle
subscribes
to
it,
i
do
know
that
the
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
rogers
case
at
252
f.2nd
807
and
again
at
271
f.2d
364
in
the
appeal
of
the
rogers
case,
has
reaffirmed
the
fact
that
the
connecticut
subscribes
to
the
orthodox
rule.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no
question
about
that,
mr.
frankfurter
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
and
for
that
matter,
the
supreme
court
of
errors
in
this
very
case
stated
what
is
the
orthodox
rule,
at
page
67,
and
it
quotes
the
state
versus
lorain
case
which
--
which
is
the
orthodox
case
in
this
matter.
so,
that
i
think
the
stein
case
has
no
application
whatsoever
to
this
particular
case.
i
think
the
instruction
of
the
trial
judge
to
the
jury
pertaining
to
the
allocation
of
responsibility
of
whether
the
trial
judge
has
the
--
sustained
the
application
--
allocation
responsibility
as
to
voluntariness
and
truth,
was
clearly
an
error
and
it
should've
been
accepted
to.
but
unfortunately,
i
was
not
the
trial
counsel
at
that
time.
it
was
an
erroneous
instruction
and
they
have
been
comments
on
--
on
this
by
mr.
zeldes
and
the
connecticut
bar
general.
mr.
zeldes,
i
think,
was
one
of
the
co-counsel
in
the
rogers
case
and
appeared
before
this
court
last
month.
and
connecticut
bar
general
article
is
an
enlightening
one
concerning
this
very
issue.
there
is
confusion
among
trial
judges
in
the
--
in
the
connecticut
courts
pertaining
to
this
very
issue
of
whether
or
not
connecticut's
discretion
(voice

--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
have
a
copy
of
it
here,
your
honor.
connecticut
(inaudible)
--
i
quoted
in
my
reply
brief,
your
honor.
30
connecticut
bar
general
221,
zeldes,
the
rogers
opinion,
confusion
in
the
--
in
the
involuntary
confession
area.
and
there's
also
a
law
review
article
by,
i
believe,
by
professor
meltzer
in
the
24
university
of
chicago
law
review
which
is
a
critique
of
this
court's
stein
opinion.
now,
my
worthy
brother
has
recited
to
no
end
concerning
matters
pertaining
to
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
matters
pertaining
to
facts
going
to
the
credibility
of
the
confession
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
well
pointed
out
that
all
of
the
corroborating
evidence
pertaining
to
the
--
these
confessions
are
well
taken.
but
they
have
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession.
i
think
there
has
been
confusion
on
the
part
of
the
state's
attorney
presenting
his
case
--
in
presenting
what
facts
are
pertinent
to
the
credibility
of
the
confession
which
is
the
exclusive
province
of
the
jury
to
determine
and
what
factors
are
pertinent
to
the
question
of
--
the
voluntariness
confession
which
is
--
it
is
his
burden
to
prove
and
not
mine
which
is
the
responsibility
that
the
trial
judge
determined
in
his
preliminary
hearing.
we
claim
that
the
trial
judge
in
finding
that
these
confessions
were
voluntary
committed
grave
error
that
the
facts
which
we
have
recited,
the
facts
of
the
mental
defectiveness,
the
factors
and
the
elements
of
the
use
of
the
wife
and
the
two
children,
the
factors
as
to
the
delay
in
presentment,
the
factor
as
to
the
prolonged
and
intensive
and
extensive
investigation
and
interrogation,
rather,
the
factor
as
to
the
--
the
language
used
here
clearly
that
we
--
we
quoted
from
the
police
officer's
testimony
here
in
the
--
in
--
in
the
record
as
to
how
each
of
these
confessions
were
taken.
the
language
was
clearly
that
are
rome's.
he
would
paraphrase
the
incoherent
phrasing
of
culombe
and
it
would
--
it
was
his
language.
all
--
all
this
court
has
to
do
is
to
take
the
three
confessions
which
are
a
matter
of
record
and
compare
it
with
the
--
with
the
incoherent,
altering,
inept
language
and
testimony
of
the
accused
on
the
witness
stand
and
you
have
the
answer
to
this
case.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
so
far
as
i
know,
i
believe
it
was
recited.
that
it
is
--
i
take
exception
to
the
statement
made
by
my
worthy
brother
that
that
was
not
presented
into
the
record
because
officer
--
detective
o'brien
did
testify
in
this
case
and
did
testify
as
to
the
oral
confession
taken
that
wednesday
afternoon.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
we
have
--
actually,
the
stenographic
report
is
an
exhibit
in
this
case.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
it's
an
exhibit
and
full
exhibit
in
this
case.
i
believe
that
it's
--
it
is
somewhere
in
the
--
among
the
exhibits
we
have
transferred
in
many
of
the
--
of
the
exhibits
in
this
case.
and
i
respectfully
invite
this
court's
attention
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
the
exhibit
is
in
here
because
i
have
reviewed
these
exhibits
all
day
yesterday.
i
spent
--
reviewing
these
exhibits.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
it
is
obviously
not
his.
you
read
--
you
read
the
testimony
of
--
of
the
accused.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
and
reading
these
confessions
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
impeccable,
flawless
language,
coherent,
integrated
and
clearly
the
language
of
the
accused
on
the
witness
stand
is
anything
but
integrated.
this
is
a
moron
we're
dealing
with.
the
man
with
an
iq
of
60
who
has
never
written
or
--
or
read
a
--
a
book
in
his
life,
probably,
can't
read
or
write.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
would
go
to
the
extent
of
fact
that
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
because
they're
not
fabricated
in
that
sense
but
they
are
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
they
are
not
accurate
reproductions
of
what
he's
saying
there.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
they're
invented
but
they're
not
fabricated.
i
wouldn't
claim
fabrication
here.
i
do
claim
that
they
are
not
in
the
words
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
about
the
culombe
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
which
are
not
pertinent
to
the
possible
degree
of
crime
to
which
he's
confessing
which
judge
smith
in
his
memorandum
of
decisions,
federal
judge
smith
who
is
now
circuit
court
of
appeals
judge,
stated
very
eloquently
in
his
decision
of
state
against
reed,
united
states
against
reed
in
which
he
points
out,
this
is
an
element
of
coercion.
i'm
not
claiming
this
is
a
--
as
any
other
thing
but
an
element
of
coercion.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
as
i
say,
at
page
7
of
judge
--
of
judge
smith's
decision,
"statements
elicited
during
questioning
are
bound
to
be
colored
to
some
extent
by
the
purpose
of
the
questioner
who
inevitably
leaves
the
witness
in
the
absence
of
court
control.
this
coloring
is
compounded
where
the
statement
is
not
taken
down
stenographically
but
written
out
as
a
narrative
in
language
supplied
by
the
questioner."
the
very
factual
situation
here
which
judge
smith
reversed
the
conviction
in
this
case,
where
the
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant
is
an
issue
in
--
in
the
case
as
it
was
--
as
it
is
in
our
case.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
"this
wording
of
his
account
of
the
crime
is
a
vital
importance,"
says
judge
smith.
the
jury
in
reed's
case
was
charged
and
then
it
could
bring
a
verdict
of
guilty,
a
murder
in
the
first
degree
with
or
without
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment,
merit
on
the
second
degree,
manslaughter
or
not
guilty
with
the
confession
and
evidence
have
brought
in
a
verdict
of
guilt
in
the
first
degree
carrying
the
mandatory
death
sentence.
had
counsel
been
available
to
reed,
he
might
have
advised
reed
of
a
danger
to
went
on
trial
for
his
life
on
charges
such
as
were
faced
by
reed
of
adopting
the
language
of
another
in
a
statement
signed
by
him.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no.
in
this
case,
they
--
they
elicited
answers
to
questions
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
it
is
not
true.
what
happened
wednesday
afternoon
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
it
is
not
true.
that
is
not
true
and
the
record
proves
it
and
i
--
my
references
is
to
the
record
indicate
that
they
were
paraphrasing.
he
would
--
he
would
get
an
answer
from
culombe
and
put
it
in
his
own
words
and
composed
it
in
his
own
words.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no,
it
wasn't
a
verbatim
reproduction.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
this
was
the
testimony
of
the
police
in
this
case.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
there
was
no
officer
present
at
the
time
of
the
other
confessions.
the
officer
is
on
the
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
there
was
such
an
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
episode.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
we
have
a
--
we
have
that
in
exhibit.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
--
the
stenographic
notes
are
verbatim
--
is
a
verbatim
reproduction.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes,
there
was.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
believe
there
was
such
an
examination
but
the
more
--
more
deliberate
examination
when
--
was
as
to
the
written
confessions.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
i
would
have
to
refer
to
the
record.
i
frankly
do
not
know
that
--
the
answer
to
that
question
at
this
time.
i
do
know
there
was
some
cross-examination
of
the
officer
who
took
stenographic
notes
and
those
stenographic
notes
are
on
exhibit.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
stenographic
notes
are
verbatim
reproduction
of
what
was
stated
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
well,
i'm
referring,
of
course,
to
the
written
confessions
when
i
stated
the
--
that
particular
proposition,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
yes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
no.
i
don't
believe
there's
a
transcription
of
those
notes.
however,
i
think
that
the
officer
who
took
those
notes
did
testify
pertaining
to
the
statement
that
he
took
on
the
stenographic
notes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
oh,
i'm
sorry,
this
is
a
--
this
is
the
stenographic
notebook
which
i
assumed
was
the
--
this
is
the
interrogation
of
joseph
taborsky.
i'm
--
i'm
confused,
if
your
honors
please,
i
believe
this
is
the
stenographic
note
concerning
the
interrogation
of
joseph
taborsky
but
not
of
the
accused.
now,
it
may
contain
--
it
may
contain
his
notes,
stated
march
1st,
1957
at
6:30
pm.
this
is
the
state's
exhibit
concerning
joseph
taborsky.
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
(inaudible)
63
your
honor
of
volume
2
of
the
transcript.
and
you
have
it
all.
it's
here.
this
is
detective
o'brien
being
examined.
"yes,
sir."
"and
can
you
tell
us
substantially
what
did
take
place,
what
was
said?"
"you
mean
the
entire
conversation?"
he
said.
"substantially,
without
reading
your
notes,
have
you
(inaudible)
transcript
of
the
notes."
"no,
sir,
i
have
it
here."
"you've
got
them
in
shorthand?"
"but
you
haven't
transcribed
it,
have
you?"
"no,
sir,
i
haven't
read
the
typewritten
transcript."
"but
have
you
reviewed
it?"
well,
that
was
available
to
cross-examination
and
having
him
read
on
cross-examination,
probably
the
stenographic
notes.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
the
notes
themselves
were
not
transcribed
or
made
in
exhibit.
but
they
were
available
in
the
officers
and
on
the
witness
stand
for
him
to
be
--
to
have
it
cross-examined.
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
statement
concerning,
if
i
may
--
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
--
your
honor,
concerning
the
so-called
cooperativeness
and
the
kindly
treatment
that
sergeant
paige
was
supposed
to
have
a
fatherly
treatment
that
is
claimed
by
the
state
in
this
case.
now,
i'm
rather
familiar
with
the
korean
war
tactics
of
the
war
prisoners
and
i
know
somewhat
about
the
pavlovian
theory
of
--
uses
of
--
ways
by
which
sophisticated
ways
of
confusing
a
prisoner.
now,
there
are
--
it
was
used
during
the
korean
war
whereby
one
person
would
be
subjected
to
adverse
oppressive
measures
by
one
person,
then
he
would
--
should
be
shuttled
back
again
to
one
who
is
kindly
and
fatherly
and
who
--
who
would
act
as
a
father,
confess
it
to
that
one
person.
i
think
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
we
had
lieutenant
rome
who
subjected
the
petitioner
to
oppressive,
stern,
forceful
measures
and
then
afterwards,
he
was
shuttled
back
--
shuttled
forward
to
sergeant
paige,
his
immediate
assistant,
who
would
treat
him
kindly,
solicitously,
benignly.
and
this,
of
course,
confounded
the
accused.
it's
a
very
sophisticated
devise
by
which
to
exasperate,
depress
and
wear
down
an
accused
prisoner.
and
this
was
done
in
korea,
it
is
done
in
the
pavlovian
technique
of
causing
breakdowns
and
mice
and
it's
--
it's
--
it
was
done
in
this
case
because
every
time,
every
time
that
culombe
had
been
subjected
to
these
oppressive
measures,
he
would
find
sergeant
paige
on
the
scene
to
confess
to,
to
tell
him
his
troubles,
to
--
to
--
seeking
him
succor
for
his
anxiety.
and
i
think
that
was
the
--
the
so-called
mutt
and
jeff
technique,
the
two
men
operating
together
in
a
system.
and
you
wearing
down
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
subtle
for
justice
and
city
as
--
as
any
other
devise
be
it
physical
abuse
or
force.
mr.
alexander
a.
goldfarb
thank
you.
