who
is
this
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
where
on
--

on
506

earl
warren
now,
may
i
ask
you
as
one
--
chief

earl
warren
may
i
ask
just
one
question
further.

the
stenographic
notes

life
photograph,
i
guess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
--
maybe
mr.
labelle
could
help
us
in
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
goldfarb,
well
--
well,
this
court
did
not
assign
you
to
--
to
represent
this
petitioner,
i
understand
from
the
argument
that
you
were
assigned
by
the
court
--
courts
below
and
that
you
have
acted
without
compensation
and
i
want
to
express
to
you
the
appreciation
of
the
court
because
we
always
appreciate
the
willingness
of
lawyers
to
undertake
these
hard
cases
and
for
indigent
defendants,
so
we
appreciate
it
very
much.
and
mr.
labelle,
i
want
to
say
to
you
that
--
that
we
appreciate
the
very
--
very
earnest
and
very
frank
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
your
state.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
think
now
that
in
as
much
as
--
we
only
have
10
minutes
more,
it
would
not
serve
any
purpose
to
start
this
next
--
this
next
case
in
view
of
our
long
--
our
long
recess.
and
did
you
have
something
more
to
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
