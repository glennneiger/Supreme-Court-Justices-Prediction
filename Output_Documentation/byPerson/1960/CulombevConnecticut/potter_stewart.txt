the
policemen,
of
course,
didn't
furnish
this
too
--
justice
potter
stewart
taborsky
had
it
when
he
was
frisked
up.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
was
a
preliminary
hearing
as
it's
called
in
some
states
or
this
was
a
committee
magistrate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what's
he
do?
bind
him
over
to
a
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
what
became
--
he'd
been
arrested
at
10
o'clock
in
the
first
day,
quite
in
the
wrong
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
this
proceeding
that
you're
talking
about
really,
technically,
he,
purportedly,
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
murder
prosecution
as
was
on
the
breach
of
the
peace.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
labelle,
this
is
a
minor
point,
i'm
just
curious.
what
--
what
are
you
trying
to
suggest
if
anything
by
the
fact
that
they
heard
metallic
noises?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
it
--
is
it
clear
in
the
evidence
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
interrogation,
the
police
were
aware
that
this
man
was
feeble-minded
and
that
he's
been
in
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
feeble-minded
institution?
justice
potter
stewart
under
normal
procedure,
is
it
possible
to
object
to
a
continuance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
generally,
is
the
defendant
given
an
opportunity
to
object
to
a
continuance?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
no
opportunity
afforded
to
this
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
--
where
are
we
now?
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
tuesday
afternoon.
justice
potter
stewart
after
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
they
asked
him
to
sign
it,
the
--
the
--
it's
clear
here
that
this
man
could
neither
read
nor
write
that
he
could
read
and
write
his
own
name
but
even
--
he
sometimes
even
misspell
his
own
name,
misspell
it
different
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
from
time
to
time.
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
they
--
is
it
clear
that
they
read
this
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
of
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
what
you're
talking
about
those,
the
kind
of
thing
that
appears
on
page
995
that
--
and
he
signed
this
z,
that
is
exhibit
z,
without
any
protest
and
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
a
direct
contradiction
of
the
witness
but
there's
a
different
version
of
what
happened.
justice
potter
stewart
he
could
have
been
--
have
been
tried
and
tried
--
convicted
of
murder.
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
have
a
good
deal
to
do
though,
mr.
labelle,
as
a
practical
manner
with
the
recommendation
of
the
jury,
might
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
a
matter
of
trial
tactics.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
has
been
entirely
consistent
in
wanting
to
avoid
being
electrocuted.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
goldfarb,
you're
not
seriously
suggesting,
are
you,
that
these
confessions
were
fabricated,
if
you
use
my
brother
frankfurter's
words.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn't
the
record
show
that
they
were
written
in
the
language
of
somebody
else
but
that
they
were
read
over
to
him
and
that
--
that
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that
he's
saying
--
after
having
them
read
over
to
him.
justice
potter
stewart
they're
not
invented
by
somebody.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
