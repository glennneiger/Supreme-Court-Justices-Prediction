would
it
--
would
it
interfere
with
your
own
notion
of
developing
this
case,
if
you
stated
chronologically
the
periods
during
which
he
was
questioned,
in
your
point
of
view,
unjustifiably,
those
who
are
present
during
such
questioning
and
any
other
attendant
condition,
all
incontestable
evidence
--
justice

all,
not
in
controversy,
other
conditions
such
as
violence,
if
any,
denial
of
food,
if
any,
denial
of
rest,
just
--
just
so
that
one
can
get
it
without
--
in
a
way
that
your
opponent
would
--
that
your
adversary
would
say,
"yes,
i
can't
contradict
if
those
are
the
facts."
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning,
i'm
just
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
do
in
order
one
by
one
so
that
i
can
make
a
tally
of
the
total
and
of
the
circumstances
and
the
number
of
engaged
and
who
they
were.
justice

meaning
by
that,
what,
if

justice
felix

we
haven't
got
forth
--
justice

was
it
recorded

the

the
record
is
a

is
an
accurate
transcription
of
what
was

what
the
place
in

it

justice
felix

what
you
say
is

what
--
what
appears
in
the
record
is
subject
to
unclear
inference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
you
say
it
isn't
clear,
you
mean
one
can't
tell
whether
it's
two

or
three

other

can
tell
it
was
two

that
it's
true

half
(inaudible)
justice

justice

justice

you
mean,
he

justice

(voice

justice

yes.
justice

he

and

and
his

was
adjudicated
before

he's

or
(inaudible)
justice

you
were

were
you

did
you
defend
them
at
the
trial?
justice

two
and
a
half
to
three
months?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
this
case
arise
a
great
deal
of
publicity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
gravamen
of
the
difficulty
in
--
justice

--
selecting
the
jury?
justice

is
it
--
is
it
open
to
use
by
way
of
description
so
one
can
understand
these
things
better
humanly?
what
does
the
--
what
you
mean
by
your
remark
that
that
becomes
a
great
deal
for
the
way
in
which
the
police
examined?
you
just
said
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
finish
--
you
--
you
covered
saturday,
mr.
goldfarb
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
were
interrupted
by
me
and
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
--
to
what
this
indeterminacy
of
--
of
beginning
and
end
or
--
or
duration?
to
what
witnesses
were
these
time
periods
established?
justice
felix
frankfurter
though
the
police
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
weren't
held
down
or
perhaps
that
they
couldn't
remember
the
exact
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
reporters
are
allowed
into
--
was
this
a
police
barracks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
afternoon
is
spent
in
part
in
having
photographs
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
all
defendants,
all
defendants
in
capital
basis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
a
trial
proceeds,
what
is
the
length
of
trial
of
the
court,
superior
court,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
superior
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
what
i
want
to
know,
whether
it
is
the
practice
in
connecticut,
in
hartford
as
part
of
connecticut,
that
a
defendant
when
the
trial
is
on,
sits
--
is
confined
within
the
cage.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
he
--
would
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he's
near
enough,
his
counsel
so
he
can
confer
with
him
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
perhaps
a
guard
or
two
behind
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
was
there
--
after
this
proceeding
in
this
police
court,
was
there
questioning
shorty
thereafter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
the
proceedings
in
this
police
court
had
ceased,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
then
i
gather
from
the
--
what
you
are
putting
before
the
court
is
that
the
conditions
under
which
he
was
appearing
in
that
police
court,
in
the
context
of
what
preceded
and
what
followed,
that
--
that
is
relevant,
has
bearing
upon
the
voluntariness
of
his
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
had
--
he,
in
fact,
had
counsel
wherein
these
(inaudible)
events
took
place
but
his
counsel
was
not
made
available
to
him,
although
he,
himself,
had
asked
from
the
counsel
there.
and
therefore,
i
should
think
correctional
(inaudible)
is
not
that
he
didn't
have
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
things
were
done
in
the
absence
of
counsel
and
otherwise,
that
nullified
from
your
point
of
view
or
--
or
rendered
--
invalid
under
due
process
clause,
what
they
extracted
from
him
in
these
circumstances.
but
he
did
have
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
that
he
was
denied
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
that
time,
he
did
have
counsel,
didn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
understand
that
but
--
but
some
of
these
confessions
were
taken
after
counsel
had
been
appointed,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
to
those
confessions,
whatever
may
be
said
about
it
as
earlier
in
this
case,
he
wasn't
denied,
he
had
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
appointment
wasn't
sham
but
what
was
done
in
the
absence
of
counsel
in
these
circumstances
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
was
an
illicit
exercise
of
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
explaining
when
you
say,
he
could've
--
he
could've
picked
a
counsel.
would
you
state
in
a
sentence
or
two
but
don't
take
more
time
if
it's
--
but
don't
take
your
time
if
it
takes
more
time,
is
the
defendant
system,
the
system
by
which
official,
what
in
other
states
as
in
new
york
when
you
close
by
way
of
assigning
counsel
--
court-assigned
counsel,
is
that
the
official
mechanism
by
which
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
indigent
defendants
is
exercised
or
deployed
in
connecticut?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
are
these
--
as
--
as
a
defendant
the
right
to
pick
anybody
he
pleases
in
hartford?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i'm
talking
--
if
he's
indigent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
said
that
the
constitutional
duty
such
as
it
is,
at
least
in
capital
cases
to
appoint
counsel,
is
satisfied
by
outstanding
official
known
as
the
public
defender,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
state
official
as
a
public
defender?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
of
a
--
what
--
what
is
the
stand
of
connecticut,
do
you
know?
how
big
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alone?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
first,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
their
--
was
their
further
questioning
after
thursday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
take
it
that's
what
the
chief
justice
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
had
steady
employment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
criminal
activities
according
to
the
state's
view
were
done
at
night,
off
--
off
job,
weekends.
justice
felix
frankfurter
weekend
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
these,
mr.
labelle.
has
your
state
--
has
connecticut,
the
legislative
scheme
whereby
if
a
man
is
suspected
of
being
or
maybe
not
responsible,
criminally
responsible,
some
procedure
is
set
going
to
find
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
done
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
--
how
does
that
come
to
be
independent

state
statute
allowing

--
while
a
man
is
put
to
stand
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
relays
the
questioners
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
a
fact,
is
it
not,
that
the
question,
whatever
its
colloquy
or
how
sure
they
participated
in
by
one
or
more
--
that
the
questioning
did
extend
from
--
from
saturday
through
thursday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
through
wednesday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
were
--
there
was
subsequent
question
too,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
purpose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
purposes
of
the
--
of
questioning
resulting
or
related
to
the
charge
under
which
this
prosecution
took
place.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
extended
form
thursday
day
by
day
through
wednesday.
that
is
correct,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
you,
you
said
--
you
--
you
indicated
there
was
a
cut
off
day
on
inquiry
about
these
crimes.
thereafter,
they
asked
about
other
crimes,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
by
that
if
i
--
in
order
to
get
it
clearly.you
mean
there
wasn't
denial
of
food
or
water?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
there
was
the
denial
of
--
of
allowing
him
to
indulge
in
the
or
(inaudible)
amenities
of
life?
that's
what
you
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
what
--
what
was
--
how
was
he
moved
into
that
court?
who
--
who
is
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
why
was
it
that
he
was
brought
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
did
they
decide
to
come
--
and
come
to
make
a
presentment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
the
local
prosecutors
asked
for
a
reach
of
continuance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
the
state's
attorney
of
your
--
now,
what
relations
in
the
local
prosecutor
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
have
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
must
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
to
instruct
him
to
ask
for
these
just
in
--
just
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
understand
it,
culombe
was
in
the
hands
of
the
police
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
all
this
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
police
brought
him
into
this
bind
over
court
and
the
local
prosecutor
prevented
the
bind
over
jurisdiction
from
being
exercised
because
they
asked
that
the
thing
be
put
over
for
a
week
and
they
continue
to
have
charges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
preliminary
--
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
once
he's
bound
over,
his
status
as
it
were
changes,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thereafter
--
thereafter,
the
mere
investigatorial
function
of
the
police
ceases
and
the
prosecutorial
begin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
if
he
had
--
therefore,
that
--
that
shift
of
status
which
may
carry
where
there's
an
important
consequence
to
him.
he's
out
of
the
hands
of
the
police
and
the
responsibility
there
--
thereafter
is
on
your
office,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
--
that
was
not
brought
to
past.
he
was
--
he
was
not
given
that
--
that
--
he
was
not
given
that
change
of
status
without
any
control
on
his
part
or
any
opportunity
to
object
to
it
or
saying,
"i
--
why
don't
you
now
bind
me
over?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
so,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
old
are
the
children,
mr.
labelle?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
to
that,
if
this
--
if
this
is
the
appropriate
place
that
you
want
to
state
something
and
comment
on
mr.
goldfarb's
remark
that
the
intellectual
and
mental
quality,
the
illiteracy
of
this
man
was
such
that
that
which
they
took
down
couldn't
have
come
out
of
his
mouth
in
the
form
in
which
speaks
his
mouth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
there's
a
mark
of
--
if
some
are
of
the
contradicts,
what
one
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
knows
about
this
firsthand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
his
mental
capacity
couldn't
have
used
grammatical,
syntactical
locutions.
anything
in
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question,
the
stenographic
notes
are
not
in
the
record
but
that
they
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
trial
is
in
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
now
addressing
yourself
with
the
fact
that
there
was
verification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
what
he
--
of
what
he
confessed,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
yes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
have
contradicted
on
that
page,
mr.
labelle,
because
his
testimony
preceded
the
testimony
of
the
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
all
that,
mr.
labelle,
you
--
if
you
state
this
out
on
this,
testimony
of
officers
prior
to
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
couldn't
contradict,
in
any
explicit
terms,
what
the
defendant
later
said
on
the
stand,
they
may
have
given
details
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
circumstances
that
in
your
mind
is
a
--
is
an
implied
contradiction
of
what
he
subsequently
said
but
they
couldn't
have
contradicted
unless
the
state
later
put
out
an
officer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
all
that
you,
on
cross-examination,
brought
out
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
this
brought
out
that
even
in
the
preliminary
hearing?was
this
brought
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
matter
contested?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
and
there,
you
(inaudible)
that
he
--
he
was
cooperative
and
what
you
--
and
you
would
say
that
if
appellant
says
he's
cooperative,
that
denies
that
you
put
up
any
protest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
wasn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
a
man
can
write
too
also
that
one,
at
least
some
people
can.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
assumption
--
merely
on
the
assumption,
mr.
labelle,
that
the
first
confession
had
been
the
product
of
question.
assume
that's
the
purpose
of
what
i'm
going
to
put
you
in
the
minutes,
now
that
is
something.
it
might
be
argued
that
the
momentum
of
that
question
continued
until
he
could
discharge
the
most
of
the
indictment
there,
couldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he's
been
consistent
in
--
in
challenging
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession,
wasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
--
for
the
first
time
in
the
supreme
court
--
your
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
isn't
brought
up
here
for
that
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
--
but
not
before
the
--
not
before
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
but
--
but
wasn't
the
question
of
voluntariness
put
to
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
after
the
judge
admitted
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
question
was
in
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he's
also
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he's
also
been
consistent
against
the
permissibility
of
this
confession
being
considered
by
the
jury
so
that
a
man
who
challenges
the
first
makes
relevant
or
sets
the
first
makes
of
a
confession
and
challenge
it
on
the
basis
of
how
the
confession
was
produced
without
calling
witnesses
of
his
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
accept
that
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
gets
down
to
evaluating
the
nature
of
the
original
confession
in
the
light
of
all
the
relevant
circumstances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
laid
great
deal
of
stress
and
one
can
see
why
you
would
on
the
circumstances
of
calling
in
the
(inaudible)
thing,
i
want
to
address
my
--
i
want
to
bear
my
prayers.
that's
your
point
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
make
that
answer,
did
you
examine
all
the
cases
in
your
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
you
state
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
state
in
willis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
do
--
you
do
in
four
cases
beginning
with
1898
down
to
lorain
in
1954,
truth
--
truth
is
an
ingredient
in
those
decisions,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i'm
saying
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
how
can
you
tell
what
you
rule
you
follow
if
the
court
says
truth
is
an
element?
how
can
you
tell
what
rule
you
follow?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
in
this
--
maybe
in
this
case
but
you
can't
see
what
the
rule
is
in
another
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
where
they
talk
about
truth
and
where
the
trial
judge
included
truth
as
an
ingredient,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
at
least
four
of
those
cases
were
1898.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
palko?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
palko
is
talking
about
the
case?
what
about
lorain,
what
about
willis?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
they
all
cite
--
talk
about
truth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
question
is
whether
--
but
there
isn't
any
set
of
rules
that
you
can
speak
of
a
set
of
rule
that
in
a
particular
case,
they
may
not
have
referred
to
the
truth
ingredient,
in
some
others
they
do.
in
this
case,
they
didn't,
in
rogers
they
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
throughout
your
cases,
they
are
all
(inaudible)
the
answers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
[laughter]
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
aren't
being
held
responsible
for
what
a
few
or
does
or
doesn't
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
merely
were
utilized
to
elicit
what
it
does,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
best
way
of
finding
out
what
connecticut
does
is
to
take
the
whole
series
of
connecticut
cases
instead
of
quoting
what
county
attorneys
or
state
attorneys
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
are
you
saying
that
from
the
face
of
it,
we
can
tell
it
wasn't
--
couldn't
have
been
his
--
his
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
but
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
reading
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
reading
it,
one
would
notice
it
is
more
or
less
fabricated,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
--
that
the
language,
as
such
literary
grace,
that
only
connecticut
police
could've
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
police
gave.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
little
confused.
as
i
understood
the
state
attorney,
the
policeman
at
the
wheel,
when
it
became
necessary
to
utilize
his
stenographic
skills,
took
the
passenger's
place
and
left
the
wheel
and
then
took
down
what
was
spoken,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
argue
that
whether
they
were
elicited
or
whether
they
volunteered
but
the
clerk
--
the
fact
that
when
he
began
to
talk,
as
i
understood
it
unless
you
tell
me
i'm
wrong,
the
officer
who
was
brought
along
as
a
stenographer
took
down
what
he
said,
is
that
true
or
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
wednesday,
i'm
talking
about
tuesday.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
--
but
he
--
does
he
take
that
down
with
the
stenographic
hieroglyphics?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
you
know?
how
do
i
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
what
i
--
you
haven't
answered
my
question
or
rather
you
didn't
take
into
minor
question
i
put.
did
this
officer
with
his
book
write
out
words
in
--
in
ordinary
and
full
language
of
the
dictation,
make
them
symbol
--
symbolic
notes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
other
confession.
i
am
talking
about
the
time
when
--
when
he
was
present
and
when
he
shifted
from
the
seat
of
a
driver
to
a
passenger
so
he
should
be
free
to
take
it
down,
was
there
such
an
episode?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
i
want
to
know
is,
did
he
write
words
out
or
did
he
write
signs,
even
if
he's
wrote
down
something
contemporaneously?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
cross-examination
as
to
what
he
took
down
and
what
they
meant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
i
--
is
your
argument
now
resting
that
this
was
made
up,
the
language
was
made
up
based
on
anything
in
the
record
whereby
the
officer
who
took
down
what
--
his
name
--
culombe
said.
that
he
took
down
not
what
he
said
but
his
own
phrasing.
was
there
any
such
examination
of
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
i
want
to
know
its
bearing
on
whether
that
which
he
originally
uttered
in
the
car
on
tuesday
was
written
down
either
in
spelled
out
words
or
from
symbols
as
uttered
by
culombe
or
whether
they
were
the
transliteration
of
the
--
or
the
paraphrasings
or
the
rephrasings
of
the
stenographer.
now,
was
there
a
testimony
on
that,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that
would
be
--
that
to
me,
would
seems
to
be
relevant
on
what
you
so
strenuously
urging
that
this
is
beyond
the
tense
of
this
particular
limited
equipment.
