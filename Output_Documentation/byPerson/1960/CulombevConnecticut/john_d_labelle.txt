mr.
john
d.
labelle
mr.
chief
justice,
mr.
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
indicter
once
said
to
the
respondent
when
he
got
up
to
make
his
argument,
it
looks
to
me
concerned
like
your
only
wet
field.
now,
you
tell
me
why
you're
not.
i
hope
respectfully,
i
may
be
able
to
suggest
to
the
court
why
the
respondent
is
not
out
in
wet
field.
in
1957,
in
january
and
february,
there
were
a
lot
atrocious
killings
in
the
hartford
area
happening
on
weekends.
culombe
and
taborsky
became
prime
suspects
in
that
continued
investigation.
and
because
of
the
atmosphere
that
was
going
on,
on
saturday
afternoon,
february
23rd,
1957,
because
the
state
police
feared
to
let
another
weekend
go,
they
picked
up
taborsky
and
culombe
as
a
--
as
suspects.
now,
when
they
picked
them
up,
they
sent
two
different
state
police
groups
of
officers
out
to
get
each
one
of
them.
one
group
went
to
taborsky's
home
where
his
mother
lived.
taborsky
was
living
in
brooklyn
by
the
way.
they
went
to
his
mother's
home
and
they
met
taborsky
coming
out
of
his
mother's
house
and
getting
into
a
car
and
who
was
in
the
car
but
culombe.
now,
this
group
of
state
police
officers
didn't
know
that
the
other
group
was
out
to
get
culombe.
so
they
said
to
taborsky
and
culombe,
"will
you
come
down
to
the
state
police
barracks,
we
want
to
talk
with
you,"
talking
to
taborsky
now.
taborsky
said,
"okay."
he
got
into
the
car
with
culombe
and
culombe
followed
this
cruiser
and
they
drove
to
the
state
police
barracks
about
2:30
saturday
afternoon.
when
they
got
to
the
state
police
barracks,
taborsky
got
out
and
went
in
and
culombe
drove
off,
the
police
officers
not
knowing
that
culombe
was
wanted.
culombe
drove
straight
to
his
home
which
was
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
from
the
state
police
barracks,
and
when
he
got
there,
this
other
group
of
state
police
officers
were
at
culombe's
home.
now,
when
culombe
got
out
of
his
car,
he
went
into
the
house
and
he
went
immediately
to
the
bathroom
and
the
officers
could
hear
metallic
noises
in
the
bathroom.
soon,
he
came
out
and
they
asked
him
to
come
to
police
headquarters
which
he
did.
culombe's
wife
was
present
at
that
time
and
she
knew
that
he
went
to
the
police
station
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
officers
talked
to
her
while
culombe
was
in
the
car.
they
went
to
the
police
station
and
when
they
got
there,
taborsky
already
being
there,
the
police
asked
him
if
they
would
go
around
the
county
to
some
adjoining
towns
so
victims
of
some
of
these
holdups
that
were
still
alive
might
view
them.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i'll
come
to
that
in
a
minute
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
when
the
evidence
comes
out
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
if
i
might.
later
on
when
they
went
back
there
at
the
night
of
the
confession,
the
guns
were
found
in
the
bathroom.
what
i'm
saying
is
with
this
incident,
the
state
police
were
right
in
their
thinking
that
they
couldn't
let
it
go
another
weekend
because
taborsky
and
culombe
had
the
guns
in
the
car
when
they
were
picked
up
getting
ready
for
another
one.
that
will
come
out
when
the
confession
is
given.
they
took
them
around
to
these
various
towns.
now,
it
is
true
that
taborsky
had
a
--
a
bag
with
him
and
in
it
was
some
whiskey
and
nobody
knows
how
much
was
in
the
bag
and
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
it
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
on
the
--
at
the
trial,
the
first
time
the
officer
in
charge
of
that
right
around
at
the
towns
knew
about
the
whiskeys
when
it
came
out
in
the
trial.
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
confessions.
and
they
would've
stopped
them.
one
of
the
officers
said
he
did
see
him
but
it's
just
an
element
that's
in
here
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
he
did
have
this
bag
and
it
had
some
whiskey
in
it.
how
much?
nobody
knows.
and
when
the
police
officers
realized
what
they
were
doing
with
the
bag,
he
had
finished
--
they
had
finished
what
was
in
it.
they
never
got
drunk
and
nobody
claims
that.
when
they
came
back
to
the
barracks
that
night
after
making
this
tour,
in
the
state
police
barracks,
one
of
the
officers,
sergeant
paige
and
sergeant
paige
is
the
officer
now
who
was
talking
mostly
to
culombe.
he
was
talking
to
culombe
about
some
guns,
so
culombe
said
to
him,
"i'm
a
gun
collector.
i
have
some
guns
at
home."
so
they
went
back
to
culombe's
house
about
8
o'clock
that
saturday
night
and
found,
i
think,
eight
guns,
some
boxes
of
ammunition
and
three
bandanas
which
they
took
back
to
the
barracks
and
brought
culombe
back.
now,
mrs.
culombe
again
was
home
at
that
time.when
they
got
back
to
the
barracks
about
10
o'clock
that
night,
lieutenant
rome
placed
culombe
and
taborsky
both
under
arrest
under
our
statute
that
you
can
arrest
without
a
warrant
on
suspicion
of
a
felony.
it
is
true
that
the
logbook
of
the
state
police
department
made
no
record,
written
record
of
it
but
that
logbook
is
simply
a
logbook
that
the
department
keeps,
it's
not
the
booking
book.
where
there
is
a
--
an
organized
police
department
in
the
county
or
state
of
connecticut,
the
state
police,
when
they
make
the
formal
arrest,
booked
him
in
the
town
where
the
organized
police
department
is
and
where
the
crime
occurred.
so,
saturday
night,
i
don't
say
that
he
wasn't
questioned,
he
was.
after
they
got
the
guns
from
the
home
and
came
back,
he
was
asked
some
questions.
the
record
isn't
clear
how
long
but
the
questioning
was
fair
questioning.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
any
abuse.
he
went
to
bed
at
about
midnight
on
saturday
night.
he
was
fed,
he
got
slept,
there
was
no
problem
of
--
of
denying
him
of
anything
and
the
next
day
on
sunday,
i
think
it
started
some
time
in
the
afternoon,
they
asked
him
some
more
questions.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
was
charged
--
he
was
arrested
under
our
statute
of
suspicion
of
having
convicted
--
committed
a
felony.
now,
at
that
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
the
--
he
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
state
police
officer,
lieutenant
rome
told
him
he
was
suspected
of
having
committed
a
murder
or
murders.
now
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
usually
does.
he
said
that
the
state
police
department
in
their
logbook,
usually
makes
such
a
record
but
in
this
case,
he
didn't.
i
don't
question
that
he
didn't.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
of
having
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
there
are,
sir.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
these
and
others.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
six
murders
had
been
committed
and
about
four
or
five
other
armed
robberies
where
there
were
gun
dealings.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
these
two
were
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
these
two
were
--
these
two
were
prime
suspects
of
all
of
them,
of
all
of
them.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
they
--
three
red
bandanas
of
the
type
that
had
been
used
in
some
of
these
offenses.
now,
a
good
many
of
the
offenses
were
committed
when
there
were
no
victims
left,
they
were
dead.
there
was
one
or
two
and
that
was
some
of
the
towns
that
they
took
them
to
where
there
was
victims
alive
who
had
been
beaten
but
could
not
identify
the
people
because
they
were
mashed.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
--
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
clear
because
it
happened
in
another
county
but
they
took
them
out
there
to
see
if
they
could
identify
them
but
they
couldn't
because
they
had
been
mashed.
these
bandanas
were
the
type
of
bandanas
that
might
be
used
in
connection
with
crime.
now,
on
sunday
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
on
the
very
first
day
and
i
--
i
admit
that.
the
police
knew
taborsky
because
he
had
been
in
states
prison
on
another
murder
and
hadn't
been
cleared
by
the
superior
--
by
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
and
let
loose.
they
were
--
knew
culombe
because
he
had
been
in
prison.
he
had
a
prison
record.
he
was
a
known
criminal.
and
when
they
started
to
talk
to
him
on
saturday,
he
--
they
became
aware
that
he
could
not
read
or
write
beyond
signing
his
name
and
that
he
had
been
in
a
mental
hospital.
they
were
aware
of
that,
i
don't
deny
that.
and
it
is
a
fact
that
he
is
a
moron.
that
is
not
questioned
here.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
worked?
yes,
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
he
had
a
job.
he
was
making
$80
or
$90
a
week.
he
was
married,
supported
a
family,
had
children.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
worked
in
a
warehouse,
hartford
despatch
&
warehouse
company
which
was
a
moving
company.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
steady
employment
making
--
take
home
pay
of
about
$85
a
week,
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
weekend
at
night.
that's
when
most
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
of
these
murders
took
place.
weekend
or
every
other
weekend,
there
was
some
kind
of
a
crime.
and
the
--
the
atmosphere
in
the
county
was
such
that
i
think
probably
they
were
picked
up
too
soon
before
they
were
ready
to
pick
them
up
by
further
investigation
but
they
had
to
do
it.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
we
have
--
we
have
a
statute
that
provides
that
either
the
sheriff
or
his
counsel
or
the
state's
attorney
can
make
a
motion
to
the
court
for
the
appointment
of
a
commission
who
will
examine
into
his
mentality
to
see
whether
or
not
he's
capable
of
standing
trial.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it
wasn't
done
here
because
the
question
never
was
raised.
he
isn't
that
bad.
he
is
a
moron,
he
is
moderately
defective
but
he
is
not
psychotic
in
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
the
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
state-appointed
psychiatrist
who
examined
him
for
the
state,
two
of
them,
they
appointed
a
psychiatrist
to
examine
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
as
soon
--
as
soon
as
his
counsel
was
appointed,
the
state-appointed
public
defenders,
special
public
defenders.
they
also
appointed
doctors
to
examine
him
for
them.
now,
let
me
--
could
i
write
in
here
and
tell
you
about
this
public
defender
system?
we
have
a
permanent
public
defender
statute.
it's
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
he
is
a
paid
officer
of
the
court
appointed
by
the
judges
for
two-year
term.
he
is
an
experienced
--
experienced
criminal
lawyer.
he
does
a
great
deal
of
business
in
hartford
county.
he's
tried
lots
of
murder
cases.
in
this
case
where
these
two
men
came
into
court,
right
away,
it
was
obvious,
he
couldn't
represent
both
of
them.
there
had
to
be
special
counsel
appointed.
both
of
these
men
who
were
hardened
criminals
and
experienced
said
they
want
a
special
counsel.
and
the
superior
court
gave
them
their
choice
of
counsel
and
they
picked
two
of
the
best
lawyers,
criminal
lawyers
in
hartford
county
to
defend
them.
and
the
state
gave
them
those
two
special
public
defenders
and
paid
them,
and
paid
them
and
paid
every
expense
in
connection
with
their
trial
including
their
doctors,
their
psychiatrist,
anything
they
wanted.
now,
you
asked
the
question,
justice
frankfurter,
"how
does
this
public
defender
operate?"
he
has
a
right
to
spend
whatever
money
is
necessary
for
investigation
purposes.
he
only
has
to
ask
the
superior
court
judge
for
permission
to
spend
it
and
i
don't
know
that
it's
ever
been
denied.
he
can
hire
private
investigators
or
anything
else.
i'm
back
to
sunday
again.
sunday,
he
--
they
were
questioned.
i
don't
deny
that.
but
that
questioning
every
single
time
was
fair
questioning.
there
isn't
a
bit
of
evidence
in
this
record
that
he
was
ever
deprived
of
food,
sleep,
that
he
was
abused
in
anyway.
extended
but
fair
questioning
during
this
investigation
of
these
crimes
and
there
were
a
lot
of
them.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
there
wasn't.
there
--
and
the
record
shows
that
too,
your
honor,
and
i've
mentioned
in
my
brief
with
the
citation
of
the
page.
there
were
not
relays
of
officers.
there
were
no
extended
questioning
in
time.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
culombe
took
the
stand
on
the
preliminary
examination
for
the
admission
of
his
confession,
one
of
the
things
he
said
was
that
sergeant
paige
treated
him
well.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
"as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
treated
me
like
a
father."
mr.
john
d.
labelle
through
wednesday,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
wednesday.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
question
that.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i'll
come
to
that
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
but
not
to
do
with
these
crimes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
you
--
you
understand,
your
honor,
that
they
were
talking
to
him
about
all
of
these
murders.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
what
happened
was,
they
were
questioned
about
the
group
of
hartford
county
crimes
that
had
occurred.
on
sunday,
i
agree,
on
monday,
on
tuesday
until
the
confession
on
wednesday.
now,
it
so
happened
when
i'll
come
to
the
cutoff
date.
i'll
answer
you,
while
we
are
here.
on
thursday,
after
the
confession,
the
only
questioning
that
occurred
was
that
some
new
york
detectives
came
up
there
and
talked
to
culombe
and
taborsky
both
about
some
new
york
murders
to
see
if
they
were
involved
in
them.
it
was
cursory
and
apparently,
they
were
not
and
they
went
back
to
new
york.
now,
that's
what
the
record
is
about
thursday
after
wednesday
and
there
was
no
any
--
any
questioning
in
connection
with
these
particular
crimes
or
the
confessions
after
wednesday.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
was
one
of
them,
yes.
i
was
an
assistant
state's
attorney
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
the
state's
attorney
and
i
tried
the
case.
now,
let
me
talk
to
you
a
little
about
monday.
now,
the
questioning
by
ours
isn't
brought
out
clearly
and
there
was
--
all
you
see
in
the
record,
how
many
pages
of
transcript
there
is
and
how
long
this
trial
was,
so
that
if
there
had
been
anything
wrong
with
this
questioning
of
a
substantial
nature
other
than
being
extended,
it
certainly
would've
been
brought
out
by
counsel.
now,
on
monday
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
of
course,
there
wasn't
any
of
that
and
there
was
no
violence.
he
doesn't
even
press
that
claim.
there
wasn't
anybody
that
--
that
gave
him
the
--
the
rubber
hose
or
anything
like
that.
that
isn't
in
the
case
at
all.
this
is
fair
questioning
over
an
extended
period
of
time.
now,
on
monday,
they
took
him
to
new
britain
and
they
booked
him
in
the
police
court.
now,
right
here
under
the
statute,
they
should've
booked
him
for
suspicion
of
murder
or
charged
with
--
with
one
of
the
crimes.
but
they
didn't,
they
charged
him
with
the
technical
charge
of
breach
of
the
peace.
set
upon
the
$25,000,
fingerprinted
him
and
so
forth
in
the
new
britain
police
station
no.
and
then
--
this
is
monday,
and
then
took
them
back
to
the
state
police
barracks
in
hartford.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
that
was
in
--
this
is
in
the
police
station
itself
but
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
not
the
court.
now,
on
monday,
they
were
questioned
again.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
again,
there
isn't
anything
in
the
evidence
any
place
that
this
questioning
was
unfair.
and
it
was
still
an
investigation
situation.
on
tuesday,
they
took
him
into
court.
now,
this
is
where
your
cage
comes
in.
now,
the
cage
is
a
--
is
a
prisoner's
pen
in
the
back
of
the
court
where
all
prisoners
are
kept
in
the
new
britain
police
court.
and
in
this
cage
were
taborsky
and
culombe
and
i
believe
one
or
two
other
prisoners
who
were
there
for
the
court
session
that
morning.
now,
in
this
court
session,
there
was
no
arraignment.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
and
it's
true
that
there
were
crowds
outside
on
the
street
and
this
was
a
manner
of
substantial
publicity.
no
question
about
that
but
there's
no
threat
here
of
any
mob
violence,
no
threat
of
any
danger.
these
were
just
people
who
were
curious
because
of
the
--
of
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
hartford
county
at
the
time.
nothing
was
done
through
them
about
it.
they
simply
were
there
looking
as
curiosity
people
and
--
and
just
looking
to
see
what
was
going
on.now,
in
court,
the
prosecutor
asked
the
court
to
continue
the
case
one
week.
culombe
was
not
asked
to
plea,
to
do
anything.
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything
and
he
didn't.
now,
if
there
is
any
question
about
photographs
in
that
court,
it
occurred
before
court
opened.
during
the
court
session,
there
wasn't
any
--
anything
like
bedroom
or
anything
like
that.
it
was
an
orderly
court
procedure
that
the
local
prosecutor
now
asked
the
judge
to
continue
the
matter
for
one
week.
after
the
continuance
was
--
this
was
now
some
time
in
the
middle
of
the
morning,
they
took
him
back
to
hartford,
to
the
state
police
barracks.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
in
the
sense
that
they
were
in
the
public
part
of
the
courtroom.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that,
i'm
not
positive
of,
your
honor.
the
record
isn't
quite
clear
but
this
prisoner
was
not
treated
in
any
different
way
than
another
prisoner
except
that
he
was
not
taken
out
of
the
prisoner's
pen
and
brought
up
to
the
bench.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
in
this
case,
he
wasn't
presented
for
arraignment.
nothing
was
done
except
the
prosecutor
asked
to
continue
it.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
state
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
state
police
brought
him
there
for
a
presentment.
that
is
true.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
they
brought
him
there
because
under
--
under
the
holding
statute,
it
says
that
he
shall
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
with
the
--
with
reasonable
diligence.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
in
the
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
we
had
a
municipal
court
system
and
where
he
was
booked
in
new
britain,
the
local
prosecutor
handles
it
for
purposes
of
bind
over
and
in
a
murder
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
case
or
any
other
felony
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
did
not.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
and
our
office
did
not.
now,
it's
claimed
and
i
think
it's
probably
true
that
the
sate
police
said
to
the
local
prosecutor
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
"we'd
like
some
more
time."
i
don't
think
that
that's
unfair
and
--
and
i
think
that's
what
happened.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
when
he
comes
into
the
local
court?
mr.
john
d.
labelle
if
--
if
it's
a
felony
where
the
sentence
may
exceed
five
years,
he
must
be
sent
to
the
superior
court
on
a
blind
rule.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
there
can
be
a
hearing
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
there
can
be
a
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
at
--
at
the
formal
bind
over
hearing,
that
is
done.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
when
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
when
he's
brought
in
to
enter
some
plea
to
the
charge
in
the
lower
court
for
purposes
of
bind
over,
he
is
advised
of
his
rights
if
he
doesn't
have
counsel.
if
he
has
counsel,
counsel
may
waive
hearing
and
consent
to
a
bind
over
or
may
have
a
hearing
in
probable
cause.
that
--
that
is
--
the
state
has
to
put
on
enough
evidence
to
satisfy
the
court
that
there's
probable
cause
to
bind
him
over.
now,
the
court,
that
lower
court
has
no
jurisdiction.
it's
simply
a
bind
over
proceeding
where
the
felony
is
one
where
the
penalty
exceeds
by
years.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
now,
on
the
bind
over
--
under
--
under
the
continuance,
the
local
court
issues
a
mittimus
to
put
him
in
jail
pending
the
continuance
time.
the
state
police
took
him
from
the
court
sometime
around
noon
or
whenever
it
was
and
took
him
back
to
the
barracks
and
they
talked
to
him
again
that
afternoon.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
suppose
so.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
ordinarily
where
he
has
counsel,
he
has
a
right
to
object
and
take
the
bind
over
if
he
--
or
if
he
wants
his
hearing,
i
suppose
he
can.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
there's
no
opportunity
afforded
at
this
point.
he
didn't
have
counsel
and
if
he
didn't
ask
and
i
suppose
he
didn't
know.
i
don't
claim
that
but
the
point
was
that
none
of
his
rights
were
impaired
so
far
as
getting
a
fair
trial
was
concerned
by
anything
that
happened
in
that
court.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
he
become
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
right.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that
--
that's
so,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
deny
that.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
deny
that.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it
was
later
that
night.
they
took
him
to
hartford
and
talked
to
him
again,
i
don't
deny
that.
and
about
8
o'clock
that
night,
took
him
to
the
jail.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
into
that,
if
i
may.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
best
i
can
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
the
best
i
can
get
from
the
record
was
sometime
around
noon.
it
--
they
were
brought
over
there
in
the
morning
and
i
think
these
proceedings
there
must
have
been
at
somewhere
about
noon
and
they
took
him
back
to
the
barracks.
now
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
it's
--
he
becomes
the
prisoner
of
the
state
attorney's
office
and
then
under
--
only
in
capital
cases
do
we
have
to
indict.
we
--
in
all
cases
except
capital
cases,
we
can
start
prosecution
by
information.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
and
in
this
case,
it
would've
had
to
be
grand
jury.
it
was
grand
jury.
but
in
--
in
capital
cases,
that's
the
only
ones
where
we
have
to
have
a
grand
jury.
now,
going
back
again
to
the
same
thing,
tuesday
afternoon,
when
they
got
back
to
hartford,
lieutenant
rome,
the
officer
in
charge
in
the
investigation,
went
to
see
mrs.
culombe.
and
this
is
in
the
record
and
it's
clear
and
she
testified
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
tuesday
afternoon
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
or
tuesday
evening,
sometime.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
after
coming
back
from
new
britain.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
went
to
see
mrs.
culombe
and
he
talked
to
her.
now,
i
say
right
here
that
talking
to
the
wife
of
an
accused
is
legitimate
avenue
of
investigation.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
the
wife
of
the
accused
is
one
of
the
first
people
that
he
would
talk
to.
he
went
to
talk
to
her
and
she
was
upset.
she
was
mad
to
think
that
her
husband
was
involved
in
this
thing.
and
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
this
comes
out.
during
these
murders,
a
little
girl
was
left
in
the
car
in
the
middle
of
december
when
it
was
a
freezing
sleeting
night.
a
little
18-month
old
girl,
the
daughter
of
one
of
these
victims
was
left
in
the
car
at
the
station.
all
the
power
was
off
except
the
station,
they
had
private
power.
there
was
a
sleeting
freezing
night,
the
night
of
the
murder.
and
his
wife
--
culombe's
wife
was
just
mad
to
think
that
that
little
girl
had
been
left
there.
she
could've
frozen
to
death
except
the
bus
driver
came
along
and
saw
her
and
then
went
in
to
the
station
and
found
the
bodies.
so
culombe's
wife
was
mad.
so,
sergeant
--
lieutenant
rome
said
to
her,
"do
you
want
to
talk
to
your
husband?"
she
said
yes.
he
said,
"will
you
come
down
to
the
station?"
so
he
went
back
to
the
state
police
barracks
and
that
night,
sent
a
policewoman,
a
nurse
--
a
state
policewoman
to
pick
up
mrs.
culombe
and
they
brought
her
down
to
the
station
and
she
confronted
her
husband
and
said
something
to
him
about,
"how
did
you
get
in
to
this
thing?"
and
in
the
course
of
this,
he
became
upset
and
she
was
upset.
now,
the
children
went
with
her
too
but
the
children
did
not
see
their
father
before
these
confessions.
now,
that
record
is
clear.
i
don't
want
to
be
said
that
we
used
the
children
to
get
the
confession
out
of
the
father
because
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that
and
in
fact
it
says,
"they
didn't
see
their
father
until
after
he
had
confessed."
mr.
john
d.
labelle
thirteen
and
eleven,
i
believe,
two
little
girls.
but
the
mother
--
no
thirteen
and
five,
excuse
me.
the
mother
said,
"i
didn't
want
to
leave
them
home."
she
testified
here.
her
testimony
is
in
there.
now,
let
me
--
let
me
say
to
the
court,
here
is
a
very
key
part
of
this
case.
after
culombe
was
upset
and
his
wife
had
left
him,
he
went
downstairs
to
the
cell
and
this
is
about
7:30
at
night
now,
tuesday
night.
sergeant
paige
who
was
conducting
the
part
of
this
investigation
as
to
culombe
went
down
to
see
him
and
saw
that
he
was
upset
and
stayed
only
a
few
minutes
and
didn't
hardly
talked
to
him
and
left
him.
now,
you
know
of
the
old
adage
that
when
they're
on
the
rope,
slug
on.
and
right
here,
if
the
state
police
were
using
improper
tactics,
this
was
the
time
to
put
the
pressure
on.
what
did
he
do?
he
left
him.
and
a
few
minutes
later,
they
took
him
to
the
county
jail
and
culombe
was
not
talked
to
again
for
18
hours.
now,
i
say
that's
an
indication
that
the
state
police
here
were
sure
carrying
out
extended
interrogation
in
a
matter
that
was
of
some
importance
to
our
state
but
they
did
not
do
anything
improper
with
regard
to
their
rights
of
that
man
because
right
then
and
there
where
he
was
upset
after
talking
to
his
wife,
if
they
put
the
pressure
on,
they
could
--
and
after
a
coerced
confession,
they
could've
got
it.
now,
they
picked
him
up
from
the
jail
and
they
say,
borrowed
him
the
next
day.
that
is
true.
he
was
in
the
jail
under
that
adjourned
mittimus
from
the
new
britain
court
and
he
was
taken
there
late.
i
don't
deny
that,
that's
true.
the
next
morning,
they
took
him
back
to
the
state
police
barracks
again
to
talk
to
him
and
they
started
talking
to
him
about
1:30
on
wednesday
afternoon.
now,
mind
you,
they
hadn't
talked
to
him
or
questioned
him
for
18
hours
from
about
7:30
the
night
before
until
1:30
wednesday
afternoon.
now,
on
1:30
wednesday
afternoon,
a
man
by
the
name
of
detective
murphy
came
in
with
sergeant
paige.
the
first
time
he
came
into
the
case
and
in
talking
to
him
after
about
an
hour
and
they
were
going
over
this
list
of
crimes
and
saying,
"to
you,
arthur,
were
you
there?"
and
they
said
to
him,
"if
you
--
if
you
were
there,
you're
--
than
rather
to
lie
about
it,
say
you
don't
want
to
talk
about
it
but
they
would
take
this
list
of
crimes
of
all
these
crimes
i
spoke
about
and
go
down
the
list."
a
few
minutes
after
they
started
talking
to
him,
i
think
about
an
hour,
he
said,
"i'll
tell
you
where
the
guns
are."
and
right
then
is
when
it
started.
they
got
lieutenant
rome,
there
was
detective
murphy,
sergeant
paige
and
they
took
another
officer,
detective
o'brien
who
was
a
stenographer.
four
state
police
officers
and
they
got
in
the
car
and
culombe
said
to
them,
"i'll
go
and
show
you
where
these
guns
are
but
i
want
to
go
in
an
unmarked
cruiser."
now,
mind
you,
this
man
was
a
canny,
experienced
criminal.
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
all
the
time.
regardless
of
his
mental
capacity,
i
know
he
was
a
defective
but
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
he
said
to
the
state
police,
"i'll
take
you
but
i
want
to
go
in
an
unmarked
cruiser."
and
the
four
of
them
went.
detective
o'brien,
the
stenographer,
was
driving.
and
just
when
they
started,
and
culombe
only
lives
a
few
minutes
from
the
state
police
headquarters,
they
had
only
gone
a
few
blocks
down
the
street
in
front
of
our
courthouse
in
hartford
when
culombe
in
the
backseat
with
lieutenant
o'brien
started
to
confess.
excuse
me,
with
lieutenant
rome,
started
to
confess.
they
stopped
the
car,
detective
murphy
got
into
the
driver
side
and
took
the
wheel
and
started
on
o'brien,
the
stenographer,
got
on
to
the
passenger
side
and
started
taking
down
in
shorthand
what
culombe
said.
now,
what
he
took
down
in
shorthand
is
essentially
the
confession
that
was
committed
to
writing
that
night.
now,
let
me
tell
you
what
happened
after
that.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well,
they
did
take
it
out
of
his
mouth.
there
was
a
transcript,
the
shorthand
transcript
made
of
what
he
said
in
the
car.
mr.
john
d.

no.
mr.

mr.
john
d.
labelle
if
--
if
you
look
at
the
record
and
my
brief
sets
--
spells
this
out
at
the
preliminary
hearing
on
the
confession,
detective
o'brien
testified
as
to
what
he
said
in
the
car.
what
he
said
in
the
car
was
essentially
what
is
in
the
written
confession
which
was
committed
that
night.
counsel
--
experienced
trial
counsel
had
the
right
to
go
over
sergeant
o'brien's
notes
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
on
cross-examination.
and
if
you
look
at
the
record,
and
it's
mentioned
in
the
pages
in
my
brief,
he
didn't
even
go
into
the
cross-examination
on
the
details
of
that
confession.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
only
what
happened
on
the
stand
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
what
happened
on
the
stand,
detective
o'brien
testified
what
he
said.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
no.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
we
don't
have
that.
but
he
testified
orally
what
was
said.
defense
counsel
said,
"do
you
have
your
notes?"
the
sergeant
o'brien
said
yes.
and
he
had
passed
them
to
him,
the
stenographic
notes.
they
--
they
said
to
him
something
like,
"do
you
remember
what
was
said?"
he
said,
"yes,
i
don't
need
to
refer
to
my
notes,
i
know
what
he
said."
and
counsel
then
didn't
go
any
further
with
the
point.
defense
counsel
now
didn't
go
any
further
with
the
point
if
there
was
any
question
as
to
what
was
said
in
the
car
orally
and
what
detective
o'brien
testified
to
on
the
stand,
it
could
have
been
brought
out.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
it's
right
there
and
counsel
could
have
done
anything
he
wanted
with
reference
to
him
on
cross-examination.
now,
when
they
got
to
culombe's
house,
and
i
come
back
to
the
very
beginning,
your
honor,
when
they
got
into
the
house,
culombe
said,
"go
into
the
bathroom
and
take
out
the
--
the
cabinet,
the
medicine
cabinet,
it's
screwed,
it
was
a
metal
one,
and
down
behind
the
medicine
cabinet
in
the
wall,
you'll
find
some
guns."
they
did
that.
this
is
the
metallic
noises
on
the
first
day.
they
found
a
bag
with
two
or
three
guns
in
it
and
some
ammunition,
the
guns
that
were
in
the
car
on
the
saturday
afternoon
when
taborsky
and
culombe
were
first
picked
up.
now,
when
he
got
to
the
house,
and
this
is
very
significant
now,
if
your
honors
please,
his
wife
was
there
again.
and
he
said
to
his
wife,
"i'm
making
a
clean
rest
of
things.
i
want
to
get
it
off
my
conscience
and
i'm
telling
the
truth
and
i'll
probably
get
life
and
taborsky
will
get
the
chair.
now,
right
here
is
the
key
to
this
case.
here's
a
man
who
made
this
confession
because
he
wanted
to
save
his
neck,
not
because
he
was
forced
but
because
he
knew
that
his
only
way
out
was
to
get
this
confession.
and
the
very
first
day
when
it
happened,
he
said
to
his
own
wife,
"i
confessed
and
i
may
get
the
chair
but
i
may
get
life
and
taborsky
will
get
the
chair.
now
that's
very
significant.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
think
so.
i
don't
think
that's
disputed.
everybody
heard
it.
there
were
several
people
there.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
know
that
she
was
asked,
your
honor.
i'll
--
she
only
testified
in
the
preliminary
hearing
by
the
way.
i'll
discuss
that
in
a
minute
if
i
don't
run
out
of
time.
let
me
go
right
from
here
as
fast
as
i
can.
he
then
said
to
him,
"i'll
show
you
where
the
guns
are."
by
the
way,
in
the
house,
in
another
room,
they
found
some
gun
parts,
some
gun
grips,
cylinder,
cylinder
pen,
spring
and
he
said,
"i'll
show
you
where
the
guns
were
that
were
used
in
the
new
britain
murder."
that's
this
trial.
he
took
them
to
a
pond,
very
close
to
his
house
and
he
said,
"the
two
guns
were
in
the
pond."
one
gun
is
a
strip
down
on
because
the
parts
in
my
house
will
fit
it.
the
state
police,
several
days
after
the
confession
now,
by
dragging
that
pond
with
a
potato
hook
and
by
using
an
electromagnet
found
both
of
those
guns.
and
the
gun
grips
in
his
house
fit
the
one
that
was
stripped
down
out
of
the
pond
and
the
numbers
inside
the
gun
grip
scratch
fit
the
serial
number
on
the
barrel
of
that
gun.
he
pointed
to
another
pond
the
same
afternoon
now,
mind
you,
and
he
said,
"there's
a
raincoat
thrown
in
that
pond
that
we
used
in
the
new
britain
shootings.
we
threw
it
in
there
because
there
was
splattered
blood
on
it."
one
of
the
police
officers
that
wednesday
afternoon
went
to
the
pond
and
found
the
raincoat,
an
army
raincoat,
the
kind
we
had
in
the
service.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
not
only
that
but
it
was
done
in
voluntary
manner.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
this
raincoat
was
found,
his
name
was
on
the
collar
of
it,
culombe
and
also
blood
spots
on
the
coat.
he
took
them
around
and
showed
them
the
car
they
had
used,
all
this
is
tied
up.
an
oldsmobile
that
he
had
owned
at
the
time
was
in
a
used
car
lot
in
the
other
part
of
hartford.
he
took
them
there
and
showed
them
the
car
and
the
car
could
be
tied
up
from
evidence
the
day
of
the
shooting
because
we
had
somebody
that
seen
him
in
this
black
oldsmobile
when
he
bought
a
television
set.
they
went
back
to
the
state
police
barracks
and
he
orally
made
his
confession
in
front
of
the
commander
and
commissioner
of
state
police
and
the
major,
the
executive
officer
about
6
o'clock
at
night.
then
they
went
to
eat.
and
after
they
went
to
eat
about
8
o'clock
at
night,
they
sat
down
and
started
taking
confessions.
now,
mind
you,
he
confessed
to
all
of
these
murders
and
in
taking
down
the
confession,
they
started
about
8
o'clock
at
night
and
finished
about
12:30
the
next
morning.
now,
when
they
got
to
about
11:30
at
night,
they
started
on
the
new
britain
murder,
putting
in
writing
what
he
had
told
them
about
it
and
what
they
knew,
what
he
had
said
in
the
car.
they
finished
about
12:30
which
would
be
the
28th.
and
when
--
when
they
got
through
with
that
in
the
new
britain
murder,
the
same
night
of
the
new
britain
murder,
they
had
committed
another
crime,
they
had
shot
another
man
in
hartford
before
they
went
to
new
britain.
and
in
this
last
confession,
both
of
those
were
in
it.
so,
that's
exhibit
z
--
z1
for
identification.
the
confession
committed
--
committed
to
writing
on
the
wednesday
night
and
to
12:30
on
thursday
morning
with
two
crimes
in
it.
sometime
later,
the
following
sunday,
the
state
realized
that
for
everybody's
benefit,
it
would
be
better
to
remove
that
other
shooting
in
hartford
out
of
that
confession.
so
they
took
the
confession
and
simply
made
a
copy
of
it
and
removed
the
other
affair
and
they
went
and
asked
him
to
sign
it
and
i'll
come
to
that
when
i
come
to
monday.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
they
read
it
to
him,
it's
in
the
record.
i
set
it
forth
in
my
brief.
they
took
it
up
to
the
jail,
he
was
at
the
jail.
they
said,
"this
is
the
confession
you
gave
last
wednesday
night.
it's
the
same
thing
except
we
took
out
the
lyon
matter,"
and
they
read
it
to
him.
and
there
isn't
any
question
about
counsel
claims,
deceit
or
fraud.
if
your
honor
will
look
at
my
argument
about
it,
that
the
testimony
is
--
this
is
culombe's
testimony
and
it's
--
it's
very
--
i
got
the
page
here
if
i
may
have
just
a
moment.
page
14
and
15
of
the
brief.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
that's
where
the
factual
situation
is
set
up.
and
when
on
the
argument,
if
your
honor
please,
on
page
35
of
my
brief,
at
the
very
top
of
the
page,
you'd
see
the
quoted
testimony
of
--
this
is
now
culombe,
this
is
culombe.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
page
35,
the
very
top
of
the
page.
now,
this
is
all
he
testified
to
about
this
matter.
now,
that's
what
he
claims
as
deceit.
now,
the
other
testimony
is
abundantly
clear
that
they
said
to
him,
"culombe,
this
is,"
and
read
it
to
him,
"this
is
what
the
confession
was,
you
gave
the
other
night
except
we've
taken
out
lyon."
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that's
culombe's
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
culombe
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
it's
denied.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
state
police
department
denied
it
in
such
--
the
testimony
of
lieutenant
rome
and
i
think
on
page
14
and
15
of
my
brief,
it
set
forth
the
pages
491
and
605,
excuse
me.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
page
506
of
the
transcript,
page
574,
995
and
1009.
mr.

my

mr.

mr.
john
d.

middle
of
the
page,
if
you
look
in
volume
1,
page
506
of
the
record.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
volume
2,
page
574,
it
said
again.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
this
is
lieutenant
rome
and
detective
o'brien
went
to
the
jail.
and
both
of
them
verified
what
was
done.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
i
may
have
the
wrong
citation,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i'm
sorry.
let
me
look
at
574
if
i
may.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
let
me
say
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
let
--
let
me
say
that
this
was
in
the
preliminary
hearing
when
--
when
culombe
testified.
he
did
not
testify
before
the
jury
at
all
with
reference
to
the
confessions.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
on
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes.
only
in
the
sense
that
culombe's
testimony
came
out
after
the
police
officers
and
we
put
on
no
rebuttal.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
and
what
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
that's
what
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
i
--
i
agree.
that's
--
that's
what
i
refer
to
and
that's
in
my
brief
and
that
506
is
wrong,
i
apologize.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
may
--
may
i
try
to
get
to
another
point
that
i
want
to
raise.
on
thursday,
i
said
that
a
new
york
officer
came
up
and
talked
to
him
about
some
crime
that
had
been
--
happened
in
new
york
and
it
was
dropped
without
a
great
deal
of
--
i
don't
know
how
long
he
was
there
and
what
he
said,
the
record
isn't
clear
but
he
did
--
was
talked
to
on
thursday
by
a
new
york
police
officer.
now,
on
--
on
thursday
and
this
is
very
significant
now,
on
thursday
morning,
a
bench
warrant
by
the
superior
court
was
issued
and
they
were
brought
in,
taborsky
and
culombe
both
were
brought
into
the
superior
court.
and
at
that
time,
the
superior
court
judge
advised
him
of
his
rights,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
this
is
where
the
questioning
came
up
about
the
public
defender.
both
of
them,
taborsky
and
culombe
said
they
wanted
to
choose
their
own
counsel
and
they
asked
for
some
lawyers
by
name.
and
the
court
said,
"we
will
get
in
touch
with
those
lawyers
and
see
if
we
can
get
them
to
take
your
case."
they
were
advised
that
they
didn't
have
to
say
anything,
that
they
could
remain
silent
and
that
counsel
would
get
in
touch
with
them
as
soon
as
the
court
could
get
--
get
one
that
would
take
the
case,
particularly,
the
ones
they
asked
for
in
this
instance,
attorney
mcdonough.
they
also
said
and
they
asked
this
of
culombe,
the
state
police,
"culombe,
we'd
like
to
ask
you
some
more
questions.
do
you
wish
to
cooperate
with
them?"
he
said
in
open
court
in
the
superior
court
and
this
is
in
the
record,
"i
want
to
cooperate
with
them
in
any
way
i
can."
in
the
court
that
day,
not
one
word
was
said
about
any
coercion
or
abuse
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
he
said,
didn't
he
spoke
himself,
your
honor,
in
court.
he
spoke
himself,
not
one
thing
was
said
about
any
abuse.
and
when
the
court
said
to
him,
"culombe,
you
don't
have
to
say
anything,
you
don't
have
to
sign
anything,
you
don't
have
to
give
any
statements."
and
they
--
they
asked
him,
"do
you
want
to
give
any
information
to
the
state
police?
they
want
to
talk
to
you
some
more."
he
said,
"i
want
to
cooperate
with
them
in
any
way
that
i
can."
they
took
him
back
to
the
barracks
and
kept
him
in
the
state
police
barracks.
he
didn't
want
to
go
to
the
jail.
this
was
at
his
own
request.
on
friday,
his
counsel
talked
to
him,
mcdonough.
he
was
advised
not
to
do
or
say
anything.
this
is
in
the
record
now.
also,
on
friday,
i
believe
it
was
friday
or
saturday
morning,
i
--
i'm
not
just
sure
which
two
psychiatrists
examined
him
for
the
purpose
of
mental
capacity
only
and
did
not
go
into
the
details
of
the
offense.
nothing
appears
in
the
record
about
that.
they
simply
were
to
--
reexamined
him
for
purposes
of
determining
his
mental
capacity,
that's
in
the
record.
and
what
was
said
and
done
in
the
--
in
the
condition,
the
mental
condition
of
this
man.
now,
we
come
to
saturday
and
this
is
another
very
important
thing.
this
is
what
i
call
a
second
confession.
you'll
recall
this
first
confession,
exhibit
z1
for
identification
was
when
he
said
he
didn't
commit
the
murders,
taborsky
shot
both
of
them.
and
by
the
way,
in
all
of
his
confessions,
he
kept
using
the
name
taborsky.
he
kept
putting
the
blame
on
taborsky.
that's
what
he
was
trying
to
do.
taborsky,
on
the
other
hand,
when
he
confessed,
never
mentioned
culombe
by
name.
all
he
said
was
the
other
guy.
but
culombe
kept
mentioning
taborsky's
name
and
this
is
very
significant.
at
the
trial,
taborsky's
counsel,
this
is
a
joint
trial
now,
taborsky's
counsel
said,
"i
object
to
that
confession
because
culombe's
confession
keeps
on
naming
taborsky
and
the
state
said,
"we'll
cut
out
the
name."
and
culombe's
own
lawyer
got
up
and
objected
to
taking
the
name
of
taborsky
out
of
culombe's
confession
because
he
was
trying
at
that
trial
to
show
that
taborsky
was
to
blame
for
this.
now,
this
is
in
front
of
the
--
without
the
absence
of
the
jury
on
the
objection
but
that's
exactly
what
happened
and
i
had
made
reference
to
that
in
my
brief.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well,
he
tried
to
in
this
case
quite
a
bit,
your
honor.
now,
on
saturday
night,
well,
i'm
coming
to
this.
mind
you
now,
since
that
confession
on
wednesday,
he
hadn't
been
bothered
about
the
facts
of
this
new
britain
case.
from
wednesday
night
or
early
thursday
morning,
12:30
a.m.
on
thursday
morning,
he
wasn't
questioned
at
all
with
reference
to
new
britain.
he
was
in
his
cell
on
saturday
night
at
the
state
police
barracks.
and
at
6
o'clock,
a
strange
police
officer
by
the
name
of
officer
biersch
(ph)
came
into
the
cellblock
and
said
to
--
to
culombe,
"hello
culombe,
i'm
going
to
be
here
to
guard
you."
and
he
went
down
to
the
end
of
the
cellblock
and
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
started
to
read
a
book.
that's
the
extent
of
the
conversation
that
officer
had
with
culombe,
6
o'clock
at
night.
and
this
is
a
part
of
this
case
if
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner's
gloss
is
over.
a
few
--
at
10
o'clock
that
night,
four
hours
after
this
officer
was
there
and
said
nothing
to
culombe
other
than
hello,
culombe
called
the
officer
to
his
cell
and
he
said
to
him,
"i
got
something
on
my
conscience,
i
want
to
tell
you
what
happened
in
new
britain."
now
mind
you,
after
he
had
counsel,
after
he
had
been
advised
by
his
counsel
and
had
been
told
not
to
sign
or
say
anything,
this
is
that
morning.
he
called
his
officer
over
at
10
o'clock
and
said,
"there's
something
on
my
conscience
is
bothering
me,
i
want
to
tell
you
about
it."
and
he
gave
the
confession
which
is
exhibit
ee
where
he
said
he
is
the
one
who
killed
this
gas
station
attendant
himself
and
not
taborsky.
now,
i
say
to
you,
this
second
confession
goes
back
to
the
original
confession
because
this
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
you
find
out
to
determine
whether
that
first
confession
was
coerced.
this
is
a
good
indication
that
that
first
confession
was
voluntary
because
here
he
is
after
he
has
been
advised
by
his
counsel
and
told
by
his
counsel
not
to
do
or
say
anything,
he
go
voluntarily
to
a
strange
police
officer,
confesses
again.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
it
could.
it
could,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
it
applies
because
he
had
his
counsel.
he
was
brought
into
the
superior
court
and
advised
him
in
court.
he
--
special
counsel
was
assigned
to
him,
his
counsel
advised
him.
he
wasn't
interrogated
for
a
period
of
some
two
or
three
days,
he
hadn't
been
bothered
about
this
case
and
yet
voluntarily
to
a
strange
police
officer
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
investigation.
he
calls
him
over
and
said,
"i
want
to
tell
you
something
to
clear
my
conscience."
again
i
say
the
motivation
for
this
confession,
the
first
one
and
the
second
one
was
a
motivation
because
he
thought
he
could
save
himself
from
the
electric
chair.
that's
what
he
was
confessing
for.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
we
and
under
our
system,
the
jury
can
recommend
life
imprisonment
without
benefit
of
parole
under
our
mercy
statute.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
not
for
murder
but
felony.
he'd
been
in
state's
prison.
he
had
been
in
the
state's
prison
and
reformatories
both
in
massachusetts
and
i
think
he
was
in
the
connecticut
reformatory
but
he
wasn't
state's
prison
in
our
state,
the
record
is
in
that
and
i
refer
to
it
in
my
transcript.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes
and
--
and
spent
several
years
in
death
row
until
finally,
on
a
new
--
he
was
let
go
and
--
and
his
--
his
brother
was
the
chief
witness
in
that
case
and
he
went
insane
and
he
finally
asserted
that
there
was
a
question
whether
he
was
sane
at
the
time
of
the
testimony,
this
is
the
brother-in-law.
taborsky
was
let
go.
now,
i
say
to
the
court
in
all
candor.
i'm
not
trying
to
gloss
over
what
happened
here.
these
things
did
happen.
he's
a
moron,
that's
not
the
police's
fault.
but
the
fourteenth
amendment
affords
due
process
not
only
to
an
accused.
the
state
has
some
due
process
coming
to
it,
society,
the
victims
and
the
families
of
these
murders
do
and
it's
a
question
of
weighing
here
their
respective
rights
that
all
parties
are
entitled
to.
now,
the
state
of
connecticut
is
not
desirous
of
convicting
any
innocent
man
and
we're
certainly
not
desirous
of
getting
a
conviction
on
coerced
testimony.
we
don't
want
that
but
i
say
in
all
fairness
here
if
you
will
remember.
when
you
look
at
these
facts
and
that
second
confession
goes
back
to
the
first
and
i
think
it
shows
an
intention
on
his
part
to
cooperate.
he
even
said
of
his
wife
in
the
very
first
instance,
"i'm
making
a
clean
arrest
of
this
because
i
want
to
cooperate
and
i'll
get
the
chair
--
i'll
get
life
and
taborsky
will
get
the
chair."
all
that
is
in
there.
and
i
say
to
the
court,
this
is
a
hard
case,
i'm
aware
of
that.
it's
hard
for
everybody.
it
was
hard
for
the
police.
those
police
officers
are
not
professional
men.
they
have
to
play
this
thing
as
they
see
it
at
that
time.
we
look
at
it
as
monday
morning
quarterbacks,
looking
back,
looking
back.
and
sure,
i
can
see
now
where
i
might
have
done
something
here
a
little
differently.
and
if
i
were
state's
attorney,
i
very
well
might.
we're
striving
--
we
always
strive
in
our
business
at
least
for
a
perfection
in
the
administration
of
justice.
a
higher
perfection
than
we
expect
in
any
other
walk
of
life.
but
in
this
case,
we
did
the
best
we
could
under
the
circumstances
and
i
say
that
he
was
treated
fairly,
there
isn't
one
i
own
of
evidence
about
it.
now,
one
other
thing
if
i
might,
well,
i
think
of
it
just
before
i
quit.
i
think,
justice
whittaker,
you
asked
something
about
the
--
the
wording
of
this
statement.
and
in
his
reply
brief
and
in
his
argument
he
had
said,
"where
the
state
when
it's
prepared
by
the
phrases
of
the
police
officers
and
put
together
that
you
can
supply
an
intent."
in
this
case,
the
intent
doesn't
mean
a
thing
because
this
is
a
felony
murder,
so
that
that
argument
about
the
police
department
supplying
some
intent
in
the
wording
of
that
confession,
doesn't
amount
to
anything
because
in
this
case,
the
intent
is
there
because
it's
a
felony
murder,
you
don't
have
to
show
premeditation.
you
don't
have
to
show
any
intent
to
get
first
degree
murder
out
of
this.
so
when
he
makes
this
argument
about
the
phrasing
of
this
confession,
it
doesn't
apply
to
a
felony
murder.
under
our
statute,
if
the
murder
is
perpetrated
in
the
commission
of
a
felony,
it's
automatically
first
degree
murder.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
it
might,
your
honor.
it
might.
but
let
may
say
this
by
the
way
and
there's
one
other
argument
i
want
to
make.
here's
the
man
when
he
got
--
we
had
a
long
hearing
on
the
admission
of
the
confessions
without
the
--
without
the
jury,
and
he
called
the
witnesses
and
took
the
stand
himself.
now,
i
say,
this
is
very
important.
when
he
took
the
stand,
he
told
about
the
things
that
are
supposed
to
happen
to
him
and
a
good
deal
of
the
testimony
relied
upon
by
the
petitioner
here
is
his
own
even
though
he
claims
on
the
other
hand
that
he's
a
moron.
he
likes
to
take
his
testimony
but
he
claims
he's
a
moron
on
the
other
hand.
in
any
event,
before
the
jury,
after
they
come
back,
after
the
confessions
were
admitted
under
the
connecticut
procedure,
he
didn't
take
the
stand
before
the
jury
nor
did
he
call
any
witnesses.
in
fact,
every
time
that
he
--
the
state's
witnesses
were
cross-examined,
we
have
to
go
through
the
procedure
twice
by
putting
in
the
evidence
relating
to
the
confessions,
all
he
showed
at
that
time
again,
riding
two
horses,
cooperation.
he
was
trying
to
get
that
jury
to
give
him
life.
he
was
playing
for
cooperation
again
at
that
time
and
i
say
that's
an
inconsistent
position
with
the
position
he
takes
here
today
claiming
coerced
confessions.
that's
an
inconsistent
position
that
this
court
must
take
into
consideration.
i
think
that's
important
and
i
think
that
--
that
indicates
that
he's
trying
to
right
--
play
both
sides
of
the
street.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
until
--
not
before
the
jury,
your
honor,
never
did
before
the
jury.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
on
the
basis
of
the
preliminary
hearing
only
without
the
jury.
now,
i
don't
say
that
he
can't
raise
the
question
of
voluntariness.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
no,
no.
he
raised
it
in
the
--
in
the
supreme
court,
in
our
supreme
court.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
he
didn't
take
the
--
he
took
the
stand
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes.
in
the
charge
--
in
the
charge,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes,
but
not
his
testimony
nor
did
he
call
witnesses.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
and
i
only
raised
that
because
he's
--
it's
an
inconsistent
position
from
the
position
here
now.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
sir,
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no
question
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
oh,
yes.
i
understand
that.
i
--
i
agree
to
that,
your
honor.
certainly.
by
the
way,
he
did
take
the
stand
himself
before
the
jury,
you
know,
but
only
for
a
limited
purpose,
only
about
his
mental
background
and
then
he
stopped.
and
then
nothing
was
asked
about
the
crime
itself.
he
wasn't
even
cross-examined
about
it.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
we
were
in
this
instance.
yes,
your
honor.
that
didn't
stop
us
of
course
from
arguing
to
the
jury,
that
where
he
does
take
the
stand
and
doesn't
deny
the
crime
that
an
inference
maybe
drawn.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
we
follow
what
was
called
the
orthodox
rule.
now
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
insofar
as
confidence
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
credibility.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
except
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
the
voluntariness
of
it?
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that's
in
our
charge.
it's
in
my
brief,
your
honor
and
i
think
what
connecticut
does
is
--
may
i
answer,
my
time
is
up.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
think
what
connecticut
does
is
--
where
we
have
orders
call,
i
think
in
the
books
and
overabundance
of
caution.
that
after
the
trial
court
in
the
preliminary
hearing
passes
upon
the
competency
of
the
evidence,
which
in
--
and
it's
admitted,
then
we
go
through
the
whole
procedure
again
about
the
admissibility
--
about
the
obtaining
of
the
confessions
and
offering
them.
in
the
charge
to
the
jury,
our
court
and
then
this
case,
and
it
appears
in
most
of
our
cases
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain,
we
charge
again
that
this
confession
maybe
rejected
completely
if
the
jury
finds
it
to
have
been
obtained
by
involuntary
means.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
right.
i
call
--
i
think
that's
called
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
that's
probably
the
massachusetts
rule.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well,
in
the
new
york,
you
hear
--
have
your
hearing
in
the
presence
of
the
--
your
preliminary
hearing
is
in
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
both.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
i
refer
to
that
in
my
brief.
i
think
that's
again
significant
here.
i
--
i've
mentioned
it
in
my
brief
and
i
go
--
i
mentioned
the
stein
case
and
so
on,
the
stein
rule.
i
don't
claim
in
the
stein
rule,
and
this
is
for
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
claim
in
the
--
that
the
stein
case
says
that
we
should
do
away
with
our
rule,
this
court's
rule
of
automatic
reversal
if
the
first
confession
is
coerced.
i
don't
claim
that
but
i
do
think
that
the
--
where
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
do
it
--
i
think
this,
where
you
get
a
second
confession
like
we
have
here
that
that
is
so
strong,
a
second
confession
and
under
the
circumstances
in
which
it
was
given
that
it
refers
back
to
the
person
under
the
rule
in
haley.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes.
again,
after
counsel,
well,
i
can't
--
after
he
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
no,
only
voluntariness.
our
rule
is
a
voluntary
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
question
of
voluntariness.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that's
right.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
--
i
have
quoted
something
in
willis.
i
know
--
i
know
you
have
before
you
state
versus
rogers
where
the
question
has
been
raised
whether
we
apply
it
through
falsity
test.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
well,
i
think
that
some
of
our
decisions
say
so.
i
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
i
agree.
i
agree
and
i'm
aware
of
the
cases,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i've
always
believed
and
i
can
see
that
there
is
a
question.
i've
always
believed
it
was
a
question
of
whether
it's
voluntary.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
in
this
case,
the
charge
was
about
truth
or
falsity
too.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
understand
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
--
i
agree.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
in
this
case,
said
it
was
a
voluntary
rule
when
the
opinion
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
volume
4
of
the
transcript
of
the
record.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
yes,
page
67,
your
honor,
of
volume
4.
they
cited
costelli,
palko,
zukauskas,
malm,
again,
rogers,
i'm
aware
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
palko?
mr.
john
d.
labelle
lorain
--
mr.
john
d.
labelle
--
i
know
it's
in
there.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
think
you're
right.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
don't
question
that.
mr.
john
d.
labelle
i
think
in
this
case,
he
