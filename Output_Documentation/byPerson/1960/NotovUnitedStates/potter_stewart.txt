justice
potter
stewart
now,
just
before
you
go
on
mr.
abt
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
i
--
i
had
read
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
meaning
that
there's
no
necessity
to
prove
the
active
advocacy
by
this
individual
defendant
but
not
has
meaning
that
there
was
no
necessity
to
prove
the
active
advocacy
by
the
organization
in
which
he
was
a
member.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
in
the
--
the
yates
character.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
the
character
required
by
yates.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
(voice
overlap)
--
what
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
limitation
period,
three
years?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
quite
understand.
is
it
three-year,
two-month-period,
i'm
just
asking
on
curiosity.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
you
both
agree
as
to
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
there
a
conversation
about
harboring
somebody
who
is
advocated
in
atomic
espionage?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
isn't
it
true
that
the
--
that
the
yates
decision,
and
as
you
know
it's
purely
(inaudible)
but
isn't
it
true
that
--
that
that
case
does
decide
that
the
evidence,
as
to
the
communist
party
--
to
all
communist
party,
to
be
sure,
that
case
in
the
communist
party
in
california
rather
than
communist
party
(inaudible)
because
the
communist
party,
its
activities
as
a
party,
did
not
rise
to
the
required
incitements
of
action.
and
that
the
only
basis
on
which
certain
of
those
petitioners
were
sent
--
sent
to
the
--
a
new
trial
might
be
justified,
was
specific
evidence
relating
to
them
and
not
evidence
having
the
community
activities
of
the
party.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
means
doesn't
it
mr.
maroney,
america,
unlike
every
other
country
in
the
world
--
in
america
unlike
in
every
other
places
in
the
world,
the
communism
might
be
a
shape
peaceably
than
a
bloodshed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
--
and
that
was
a
rejected
doctrine.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
record,
mr.
maroney,
as
to
the
size
of
the
communist
party
during
the
period
or
during
the
three-year
period
and
all?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
davis
sir,
something
has
been
bothering
me
about
your
whole
construction
of
the
membership
clause
which
as
i
understand
is,
i
mean,
as
you
presented
to
us,
under
that
clause
the
government
has
to
prove
associating
a
--
an
association
with
an
organization
bent
on
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
force
or
violence.
and
this
association
has
to
be
entered
into
by
the
defendant
with
a
personal
intent
to
overthrow
the
united
states
of
america
by
force
--
the
government
by
force
or
violence
and
that
he
has
to
be
active
in
that
association.
justice
potter
stewart
now
after
you
said
all
of
that,
haven't
you
proved
enough
to
convict
this
man
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act
without
any
reference
at
all
with
the
membership
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
conspiracy
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
--
in
the
yates
case,
as
i
understand
it,
it
was
the
government's
theory
that
the
communist
party
itself
with
the
--
was
the
conspiracy.
and
i
--
i
have
read
the
court's
opinion
had
the
court
read
that
the
--
that
the
proof
of
incitement
to
action
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
at
some
convenient
time
was
sufficient.
that
--
that
would
have
been
a
valid
case
under
the
--
under
conspiracy
section.
and
why
--
how
is
that
different
at
all
from
the
--
from
the
membership
section
as
you've
now
beat
it
up
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
adding
these
three
other
elements
or
two
other
elements?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
court
didn't
accept.
i
think
purely
as
a
matter
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
in
this
--
in
this
case
that
you're
now
arguing,
noto,
there
was
no
instruction
on
the
parameter
of
activity,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
--
wasn't
that
also
true
in
the
scales
case?
wasn't
it
conceded
that
he
was
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
boss
of
the
party
in
north
and
south
carolina
and
yet
in
that
case
the
court
did
instruct
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
if
that
was
true
in
that
case
it
would
be
equally
true
in
noto.
