--
oh
mr.
--
mr.
--
mr.
maroney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
address
itself
to
that
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
true
that
--
that
none
of
these
yates
defendants
were
ever
retried
because
of
the
stated
premise
or
the
department
that
you
could
not
reach
the
yates
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
read
in
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
press
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
of
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
but
you
couldn't
meet
the
--
the
yates
standard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
what
sense
is
it
--
in
what
sense
is
it
stronger
than
the
yates
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
completed
the
recitation
of
his
testimony?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
testify
in
the
yates
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
in
is
his
testimony
different
than
the
yates
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
such
a
manner
that
he's
making
--
in
such
a
manner
that
he
makes
this
stronger.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
didn't
he
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
wasn't
in
the
yates
case
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
specific
acts
of
incitement
would
lautner
testify
to,
so
far
as
this
defendant
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
anything
he
did
--
as
to
anything
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
in
the
statutory
--
statute
of
limitations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
going
--
going
what
you
call
underground
incitement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
evidence
of
incitement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
infiltrate
to
do
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
were
they
--
they're
supposed
to
carry
on
any
activities
of
incitement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
think
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
asking
you
what
you
think.
i'm
asking
what
the
record
shows,
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
the
evidence
in
the
records
from
which
--
which
the
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
leaflets,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
--
who
put
that
out,
the
party?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
you
didn't
have
to
--
did
the
--
did
the
parties
put
that
out?
that's
what
i
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
make
a
difference,
might
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
an
individual
of
the
party
or
whether
it's
the
party
itself
that
does
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i'm
not
--
i
didn't
say
it
didn't
do
it.
i
just
asked
you
whether
it
was
done
by
the
party
or
whether
it
was
done
by
some
--
some
individual.
we
have
people
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
writing
on
communism
and
writing
on
all
kinds
of
political
theory
and
certainly
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
everyone
who's
gone
through
a
party
is
not
responsible
for
whatever
a
member
in
the
party
might
--
might
say.
and
i
merely
asked
you
who
--
who
put
that
out?
i
don't
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
at
the
meeting
where
this
--
this
was
distributed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
wouldn't
it
become
important
to
know
who
--
who
did
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
48.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
--
may
ask
if
there's
any
particular
act
of
incitement,
established
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
within
the
three
years
and
two
months
of
the
--
from
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
i
--
what
i
was
thinking,
you
--
you
go
back
a
long
ways
to
show
incitement,
as
i
understood
from
the
argument
of
counsel,
you
go
back
to
1935
to
simply
what
was
said
about
--
revolution
is
historically
necessary
or
essential.
now,
if
you're
tying
that
to
the
defendant,
won't
you
have
to
try
something
to
him
within
the
statute
of
limitations?
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you're
going
to
--
if
you're
going
to
show
that
he
is
--
he's
guilty
of
a
--
an
incitement
that
will
send
him
to
the
penitentiary?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
--
is
it
a
fair
statement
then
that
there
is
no
active
incitement
on
his
part
within
the
statute
of
limitations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
conduct,
action.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
mr.
davis
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
francis
noto,
petitioner,
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
we
sustain
the
conviction
that's
in
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what
theory?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
--
(voice
overlap)
--
telling
us
more
than
being
a
member
per
se.
chief
justice
earl
warren
having
thought
of
that,
is
that
was
in
the
sense
of
an
ingredient
at
the
time
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
the
issue
has
been
--
only
been
raised
by
--
by
the
government
proving
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
membership
per
se.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
--
was
the
effect?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt.
