this
question.did
the

charge
incitement?
justice
john

so
the
case
was

in
this
respect,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
standard
to
satisfy
yates.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
what
you're
arguing
as
i
get
it
is
that
the
court
of
appeals,
because
of
what
you
claimed
that
said
respecting
the
incitement
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
has
not
reviewed
the
evidence
under
yates'
standards.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice

could

justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
what
did
the
government
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals?do
they
say
that
in
reviewing
the
element
of
the
crime
that
goes
to
the
advocacy
of
the
party
that
yates
didn't
apply?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
argued
it
on
the
yates
premise.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
has
a
bearing
--
it
has
a
bearing
on
what
the
court
arguing
in
the
court
appeals
opinion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
be
in
the
face
of
an
argument
by
the
government
that
was
premised
on
the
yates
being
applicable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
am
i
not
correct
in
thinking
that
there's
a
1200
page,
printed
--
typewritten
transcript
of
which
this
is
the
--
of
either
a
fair
--which
you
say,
a
fair
reflection
of
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
a
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
is
that
the
rosenberg
case
or
what?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
later
testimony
in
the
record,
that
the
first,
the
rosenberg,
i
thought
it
had
been
the
rosenberg.

episode
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
the
--
his
character
is
unidentical.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
there's
still
another
view
that
might
be
taken
and
that
is
that
even
though
you
assume
or
trying
that
at
the
time
the
congress
acted,
it
was
within
its
rights
in
making
its
legislative
findings
that
take
a
long
time
for
legislation
to
get
appealed.
therefore,
of
course
might
take
a
look
and
say,
"now,
as
of
this
time
those
convictions
are
no
longer
the
same."
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
it
cost
to
join
a
communist
party?
i
recall
one
witness,
he
said
he
paid
10
cents
to
in
there.
justice

(inaudible)
what
you're
addressing
yourself
to
is
that
the
court,
you're
asking
the
court
to
give
some
content
to
this
membership,
but
is
independent
as
the
vagaries
and
degree
to
different
kinds
of
memberships.
it
might
suffice,
vis-a-vis
the
institution
(inaudible).
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
point
is
that
noto
was
tried
before
the
government
introduced
this
activity
factor
in
the
situation
as
to
tracking
down
the
government.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
formulated
but
it
wasn't
articulated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
say
that
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
hold
his
convictions
that
the
--
that's
the
fact.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
point
is
if
you
tried
yates
in
the
context
of
your
activity
factor
and
in
the
context
of
yates,
and
you
put
everything
in,
you
thought
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
withheld.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
about
the
statement,
neither
that
you
referred
to
it?
what
--
what
about
the
statement
that
he
made
that
the
newspaperman
that
came
into
somebody's
house?
it
was
the
kind
of
a
fellow
that
he
would
live
to
see
the
day
when
he
would
be
up
against
the
wall.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you've
got
to
look
at
that
statement
in
the
context
of
a
lot
of
other
things.
didn't
the
statement
just
out
of
the
blue
expressing
the
violent
disagreement
with
somebody
which
you
don't
like?
justice
john

overthrow
an
individual?
justice
john
m.

you
say
that's
not
a
matter
that
the

with
the

considered
by
