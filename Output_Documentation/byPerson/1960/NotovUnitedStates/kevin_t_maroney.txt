mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
intend
first
to
outline
the
government's
evidence
in
the
case
and
to
argue
the
question
of
sufficiency
and
miscibility
of
the
evidence.
and
mr.
davis
will
then
conclude
the
government's
argument
on
the
constitutional
and
other
related
questions.
first,
to
take
up
one
of
the
early
questions
which
grows
--
during
mr.
abt's
presentation,
the
question
of
the
--
what
the
petitioner
alleges
to
be
the
failure
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
apply
the
test
of
the
yates
case.
in
--
in
that
connection,
our
brief
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
conclusion
of
the
brief,
page
62,
the
first
sentence
is,
"it
has
concluded
that
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
warrant
the
jury's
verdict
of
guilty
in
this
case
within
the
meaning
of
yates."
and
of
course,
running
through
the
brief
and
many
other
instances
in
--
in
argument
by
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
evidence
here,
as
far
as
the
communist
party,
the
party's
advocacy
was
concerned
yet
in
fact
meets
the
yates
requirements.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
not
specifically,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals,
when
it
stated
at
page
449
which
was
read
earlier,
449
of
the
record,
that
the
incitement
action
test,
enunciated
in
yates
has
been
applicable.
stately
referred
to
the
--
the
member's
own
action
because
on
the
very
next
page
of
the
opinion,
the
second
--
third
last
sentence
of
the
opinion,
the
court
said,
"since
the
defendant
was
not
indicted
for
activities,
the
end
result
of
which,
which
culminate
in
action
on
the
part
of
others,
it
was
not
necessary
that
the
evidence
of
his
activity
meet
the
yates
steps."
well,
we
think
that's
what
the
court
referred
to.
it
referred
to
the
activities
of
this
particular
defendant
in
--
in
the
non-applicability
of
yates
criteria.
now,
petitioner
further
suggests
that
we
prove
in
this
case
nothing
more
than
we
proved
in
the
yates
case
on
the
question
of
the
party's
advocacy.
and
he
further
argues
that
this
court
in
yates
held
that
the
evidence
there
was
strikingly
insufficient
to
prove
that.
we
think
he
makes
--
he
--
he
makes
too
much
of
the
court's
comment
that
the
evidence
there
was
strikingly
insufficient
because
this
court,
as
we
read
the
opinion
in
the
yates
case,
specifically
held
that
it
was
not
ruling
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
jury
under
proper
instructions
could
have
found
that
the
party
teaches
and
advocates
in
the
sense
of
a
call-to-action.
and
i
think
on
the
contrary,
the
court
indicates
that
under
proper
instructions,
the
court
could,
at
least
insofar
as
where
the
jury
could
have,
insofar
as
some
of
the
defendants
were
concerned,
possibly
have
found
that
the
incitement
was
in
the
nature
of
a
call-to-action.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
court
did
say
in
--
in
one
part
of
the
opinion
that
the
evidence
as
to
the
nature
of
the
advocacy
of
the
communist
party
was
strikingly
deficient
on
the
questions,
not
whether
the
advocacy
of
overthrow
was
an
element
or
were
intent
of
the
party
which
the
court
held
in
one,
but
that
--
it
was
strikingly
deficient
on
the
question
of
whether
the
advocacy
was
in
the
sense
of
a
call-to-action
rather
than
the
advocacy
of
an
add
effect
ideas.
i
--
i
think
the
court,
however,
indicated
in
discussing
some
of
the
evidence
later
on
with
respects
to
the
evidence
related
to
particular
petitioners
there
concerning
whom
it
will
order
a
new
trial
rather
than
acquitting.
that
some
of
the
evidence
there
coupled
with
the
party's
teaching
an
advocacy
of
marxism
and
leninism,
might
have
been
sufficient
without
deciding
the
question,
it
might
have
been
sufficient
or
a
jury
under
proper
instructions
to
conclude
that
the
--
the
advocacy
of
action
of
the
party
was
a
call-to-action
and
not
just
an
advocacy
of
overthrow
as
an
abstract
theory.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
court
there
was
doing
what
the
court
did
--
what
this
court
did
in
the
schneiderman
case.
the
old
schneiderman
case,
320
u.s.
118
indicated
that
it
would
not
say
that
a
reasonable
man
could
not
reasonably
find
on
the
basis
of
the
government's
evidence
in
the
schneiderman
case
that
the
party
thought
and
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
don't
recall
the
exact
wording
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
that
you
must
dismiss
because
of
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
these
fixed
standards
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that,
i
think
coupled
with
the
fact,
however,
your
honor,
of
the
unavailability
of
some
witnesses
who
had
testified
on
at
the
earlier
files.
so
that
--
in
any
event
in
this
case,
we
think
that
the
--
the
evidence
that
we
have
that
was
offered
in
this
trial
does
meet
the
standards
of
the
yates
case
and
it
does
demonstrate
that
the
communist
parties
teaching
an
advocacy
of
overthrow
is
in
the
sense
of
a
call-to-action.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
to
begin
with
in
this
case,
the
--
the
witness
lautner,
who
has
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
from
1929
to
january
1950,
testified
here
generally
as
to
his
experiences
in
activities
in
the
communist
party.
his
knowledge
of
the
party's
systematic
educational
program,
his
participation
in
that
program
going
that
entire
20-year
period.
he
testified
(inaudible)
to
his
attendance
that
state
conventions,
national
conventions
throughout
that
period,
testified
as
to
his
attendance
at
the
national
training
school
of
the
party
which
is
the
highest
training
school
for
the
party,
which
incidentally,
the
evidence
also
shows
the
petitioner
noto,
also,
attended
in
the
year
1947.
now,
lautner
also
identified
the
books,
the
so-called
classics,
marxism
and
leninism
which
are
used
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
party's
systematic
educational
program
for
indoctrinating
its
members.
he
--
he
introduced
the
books
which
were
also
used
in
the
--
in
the
schneiderman
case,
foundations
of
leninism,
state
revolution,
problems
with
leninism
and
so
forth.
now,
lautner
also
testified
as
to
the
reconstitution
of
the
party
in
1945
and
the
fact
that
the
party
in
1945
was
returning
to
the
basic
principles
of
marxism
and
leninism,
was
returning
to
the
--
to
the
class
warfare
that
has
been
abandoned
by
earl
browder,
during
the
communist
political
association
period
in
1944
to
1945.
lautner
testified
that
marxism
and
leninism
as
taught
in
the
school
is
not
a
dogma
but
is
a
guide
through
action.
they
thought
that
that
he
was
taught
in
the
national
training
schools
that
marxism,
leninism
and
theories
apply
to
the
united
states
and
that
the
communist
party
rejected
specifically
the
theory
of
american
exceptionalism
which
was
a
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
american
exceptionalism.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
was
a
doctrine
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
was
a
doctrine
that
socialism
could
come
peacefully
for
the
united
states.
this
was
considered
in
party
classes
and
the
--
and
the
party
members
were
taught
that
american
exceptionalism
was
a
(inaudible)
theory.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
i
don't
--
i
think
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
lautner
also
testified
as
an
expert,
as
a
person
with
wide
experience
in
the
party
who
is
in
a
position
to
testify
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
attendance
of
the
--
objectives
of
the
party.s
and
based
upon
his
experience,
he
testified
that
the
communist
party
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
and
teaches
that
it
cannot
come
about,
especially
in
a
highly
developed
country
like
the
united
states
without
force,
challenge
and
violence.
further,
he
testified
that
the
aim
of
the
party
was
to
destroy
capitalism
when
certain
objective
and
subjective
conditions
were
present.
now,
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
the
--
the
object
of
conditions
would
be
a
time
of
emergency,
in
a
time
of
a
war
or
a
depression,
when
the
--
when
the
government
was
not
in
the
best
position
to
govern.
and
the
subject
of
condition
would
be
when
the
communist
party
is
sufficiently
strong
so
that
it
would
represent
and
collaborative
the
vanguard
of
the
working
place.
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
as
far
as
lautner
is
concerned,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
he
did
--
he
did,
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well
then,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
that
testimony
parallels
the
testimony
that
lautner
gave
in
the
yates
testimony.
and
i
think
where
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
where
this
case
goes
further
than
the
yates
case
is
in
connection
with
lautner's
testimony
as
to
the
operations
of
the
underground
operators
of
the
party.
the
petitioners
involvement
in
setting
up
the
underground
operators
and
the
--
the
communist
party's
and
these
petitioner's
activities
in
the
--
in
--
what
is
called
the
concentration
program.
the
evidence
here,
for
example,
shows
that
the
--
that
the
communist
party
regards
certain
key
basic
industries
as
--
as
vital
to
the
--
to
the
nation's
economy,
industries
such
as
steel,
mining,
transportation.
having
in
view,
placing
the
party
in
a
stronger
position
where
it
would
be
able
to
upset
old
bank,
the
economy
of
the
country
or
the
ability
of
the
country
to
operate
successfully.
the
party
endeavors
to
put
key
people
in
those
key
industries
in
key
places
in
those
industries
so
that
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
slow
down
production
or
to
completely
stop
production
when
the
party
leaders
thought
the
time
was
right.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
there
was
some
discussion
there
of
concentration
but
of
course
the
important
difference
between
the
court's
conclusion
in
the
yates
case,
what
we
think
should
be
the
conclusion
here
is
the
fact
that
the
evidence
of
that
nature
was
not
presented
to
the
jury
for
decision
under
improper
instructions
as
to
incitement
to
action.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
no
specific
action
of
incitement
as
to
--
no
--
no
specific
statements
of
incitement.
lautner
did
testify.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
he
--
he
can
testified
that
noto
helped
him
in
the
party,
set
up
an
elaborate
underground
operators
in
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that
was
begun
in
1948,
continued
in
1949
and
1950
in
the
--
in
the
entire
state
of
new
york.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
it
extended
it
to
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
noto
himself
went
underground
in
about
october
of
1951
which
is
about
two
months
within
the
statute
of
limitations
and
remained
in
the
underground
under
--
under
circumstances
which
would
warrant
the
inference
that
he
went
there
under
orders
and
directives
of
the
party.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
but
i
think
that
the
--
the
underground
activities
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor
that
the
--
the
evidence
of
the
underground
activities
coupled
with
the
party's
tenant
of
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence,
permits
the
--
the
jury
to
draw
the
inference
that
the
--
the
advocacy
of
overthrow
is
not
abstract
but
that
it
is
in
the
sense
of
a
call-to-action.
the
purpose
of
the
underground
is
to
maintain
the
communist
party
in
a
condition
despite
anything
that
happens,
despite
prosecution
of
its
members
or
anything
that
might
happen
to
impair
the
communist
party's
functioning,
place
the
party
in
a
position
where
it
can
continue
to
function
legally
or
illegal,
and
it
can
--
can
continue
to
give
guidance.
now,
that
coupled
with
the
party's
activity
in
the
--
in
the
concentration
field.
i
mean,
in
--
in
this
case
for
example,
he
has
specific
indication
that
the
petitioner
noto,
receiving
directions
from
the
--
from
party
headquarters
center,
a
member
of
the
organization
down
to
new
york
to
attend
the
concentration
of
communists.
there,
it
was
decided
that
the
party
would
attempt
to
infiltrate
the
united
automobile
workers.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
infiltrate
the
union
with
party
members
so
that
they
would
be
in
a
position
in
the
shops,
particularly
in
this
instance,
the
key
shop
that
they
had
designated
of
the
chevrolet,
delavan
or
the
delavan
general
motors
chevrolet
plant
in
the
buffalo
area.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
the
purpose
of
their
being
there
is
to
put
them
--
get
them
in
to
a
position.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
the
record
shows
--
i
think
that
that
an
inference
reasonably,
could
be
drawn
that
their
--
the
purpose
of
their
being
sent
into
these
key
industries
is
to
have
them
in
a
position
when
these
objective
and
subjective
conditions
might
arise
in
the
future
where
the
communist
party
could
--
could
avail
themselves
of
these
people
on
these
key
positions
and
disrupt
the
economy
or
interfere
with
anywhere
efforts

mr.
kevin

well,
for
example,

mr.
kevin

was
disseminated
at
a
communist

meeting.
mr.
kevin

in
1948
by
the
local
director
of
steel
concentration
in
the
buffalo
area
which
was
at
that
time
under
the
supervision
of
the
petitioner.
the
pamphlet
describes
the
three
basic
industries
a
steel,
railroad
and
miner
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
this,
and
this
is
quoted
at
the
record
page
3523."
these
are
basic
to
the
national
economy,
these
basic
industries.
that
is,
if
anyone
or
are
all
free,
are
shutdown
by
a
strike,
our
economy
is
paralyzed.
it
is
necessary
for
marxism,
revolutionary
party
to
be
rooted
in
these
industries."
now
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
this
--
this
was
distributed
at
a
communist
party
in
the
union

mr.

well,
i
don't
know
that
it
indicates
--
mr.
kevin

maroney

--
mr.
kevin

this
was

it's

(voice

mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
your
honor,
this
--
this
is
part
of
what
the
evidence
shows
to
be
a
--
a
concentration
program
of
the
communist
party
which
was
participated
in
and
in
part
supervised
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case,

particular
area
of
concentration
relating
to
key

for

no,
he
was
not

that
particular

what
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
as
i
say,
your
honor,
it
was
distributed
by
the
local
director
of
steel
concentration,
a
man
by
a

of
dave

was

official
operating
under
the
supervision
of
the
petitioner
noto,
who
at
that
time
was
the
chairman
of
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
of
the
--
yes,
sir.
now,
also
in
the
year
1948,
that
the
--
the
petitioner
himself
announced
they
plan
for
recruiting
135
new
party
members
and
he
specified
that
there
would
be
40
from
steel,
30
from
electrical,
6
from
brass
and
3
from
railroad.
and
that
was
on
a
--
a
basis
of
a
--
of
a
--
little
leaflet
that
he
--
that
was
distributed
at
that
meeting
and
that
he
discussed
the
--
the
material
on
the
leaflet.
now,
in
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
not
that
he
himself
uttered
any
phrases
to
incitement
through
action.
well,
of
course,
it
is
our
theory
in
--
and
it
would
be
court
of
appeals'
theory
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
show,
to
prove
a
membership
case,
that
the
particular
member
himself
personally
taught
and
advocated
the
violent
overthrow.
what
is
necessary
is
that
the
party,
during
the
period
in
question,
taught
and
advocated
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
doing
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
we
--
we
show
of
course
that
during
the
statutory
period,
the
party
continued
to
be
an
organization
such
as
it
had
been
for
the
preceding
20
years,
an
organization
that
teaches
and
advocates
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
we
show
that
he
continued
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
to
be
one
of
its
leading
officers
and
we
showed
that
he
had
the
knowledge
that
the
communist
party
was
an
organization
of
the
kind
alleged
in
the
indictment,
and
that
he
had
the
necessary
specific
intent.
now,
i
don't
think
we
have
to
show
that
he,
at
any
time,
personally
taught
or
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
in
the
language
of
incitement.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
there
is
no
utterance
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
the
--
your
honor,
in
the
light
of
the
--
the
evidence
that
went
before,
that
the
--
the
petitioners
going
into
the
underground
personally
and
under
circumstances
which
make
it
obvious
that
he
went
there
on
directions
of
the
communist
party
and
after
he
had
indicated
to
some
of
his
fellow
party
members
that
he
would
do
whatever
the
party
told
him
to
do
to
bring
socialism
in
this
country,
to
--
to
bring
this
country
to
the
--
to
that
glorious
end
of
socialism,
that
he
would
even
be
willing
to
lay
down
his
life
to
--
to
have
that
come
about.
and
then
he
went
into
the
underground.
he
disguised
his
appearance.
he
ended
up
in
new
jersey
for
about
a
two-year
of
period.
he
--
he
lived
there
and
worked
there
in
a
key
facility
in
new
jersey
incidentally,
the
good
year
rubber
plant
and
living
there
under
a
fictitious
name.
i
--
i
think
that
that
activity
on
his
part,
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
that
went
before.
that
is
the
--
the
explanation
of
what
marxism
and
leninism
teaches.
what
the
party
teaches
and
what
the
party
was
doing
to
implement
the
teachings
of
marxism,
leninism
to
put
itself
with
the
position
whereby
when
the
time
came,
if
it
came,
it
would
be
in
a
position
to
--
to
assist,
and
as
--
as
they
put
it,
turn
an
imperialist
war
into
a
civil
war
or
to
cripple
the
unites
states
in
its
defense
evidence.
i
think
that
from
this
literature
and
from
that
kind
of
evidence,
the
jury
was
completely
warrant
in
concluding
that
during
the
period
of
the
indictment,
the
--
the
petitioner
was
a
member
and
that
the
--
the
party
was
an
organization
which
advocated
violence
in
this
sense
of
a
call-to-action
as
required
by
the
yates
case.
now,
there
were
some
mentioned
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
not
--
not
in
--
in
that
sense,
there
is
in
the
evidence.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
yes,
sir.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case,
as
far
as
paramount
is
concerned,
he
governed
by
the
dennis
case
and
the
yates
case
because
clearly
here,
the
party
is
trying
to
put
itself
in
the
position
so
that
as
soon
as
possible,
it
will
make
an
effort
to
bring
about
the
overthrow.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
right.
well,
as
soon
as
--
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
sense
that
this
--
this
object
of
conditions
might
occur,
for
example,
a
war.
if
there
were
to
be
a
war
next
year
or
five
years
from
now,
party
was
in
a
position
where
it
had
infiltrated
these
key
basic
industries
and
if
the
leaders
of
the
party
thought
the
time
was
right,
then
that
would
be
the
occasion.
here,
for
example,
there's
--
there
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
it
would
--
it
would
be
--
this
--
this
action
would
not
be
brought
about
until
such
time
as
the
circumstances
made
it
appear
to
the
leaders
of
the
party
that
they
had
a
chance
of
success.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
i
--
i
think
your
honor
in
light
of
the
considerations
mentioned
by
judge
hand
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
dennis
case.
the
--
the
world
tensions,
the
international
situation,
the
idealogical
attunement
of
the
communist
party
at
least
to
soviet
union,
that
those
facts,
all
of
which
of
course
go
to
the
question
of
clear
and
present
danger
but
they
are
the
factors
which
make
these
cases
different,
which
permit
a
prosecution
because
of
the
clear
and
present
danger.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
well,
not
specifically
during
the
three-year
period,
your
honor.
i'm
not
--
not
--
specifically,
if
the
1951.
but
in
1948,
when
lautner
was
directed
to
set
up
the
underground,
he
testified
that
at
time,
there
were
about
30,000
communist
party
members
in
new
york
state
alone.
and
that
it
was
his
job
as
part
of
the
underground
setup
to
integrate
about
10%
of
that
30,000
people
into
the
underground
operators
so
that
in
1948,
there
were
at
least
30,000
just
in
new
york
state,
according
to
lautner's
testimony.
i
--
i
will
give
you
figures
as
far
as
the
--
the
testimony
of
the
director
of
the
f.b.i.
committee
hearings
during
the
period
of
1950
to
1955.
in
1950,
for
example,
he
testified
that
the
communist
party
membership
in
the
united
state
was
approximately
53,000.
1951,
it's
43,000,
1952,
31,000,
1953,
24,000
and
in
1955,
there
--
there
was
not
--
i
don't
think
they've
given
from
1954
to
1955,
there
were
22,000
members
of
the
party.
so
that
in
the
period
of
1950
to
1955,
the
membership
ranged
down
with
53,000
to
22,000.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
sir.
now,
i
think
there
is
another
portion
of
evidence
that
was
referred
to
earlier
during
mr.
abt's
presentation
and
that
related
to
the
harboring.
in
1951,
spring
of
1951,
the
petitioner
talked
to
the
witness
chatley,
who
was
at
that
time
also
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
he
told
chatley
that
he
had
an
assignment.
the
communist
party
which
would
require
chatley's
assistance
and
that
it
would
probably
be
the
most
important
thing
that
chatley
would
ever
do
in
his
life.
he
said
that
there
was
a
--
"one
of
our
top
officials,"
he
said,
"was
on
the
land
in
connection
with
the
atom
spy
business",
and
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
get
out
of
the
country,
and
that
he
had
been
asked
to
designate
someone's
home
where
he
could
be
hidden
out
for
three
or
four
days
while
he
continues
his
route
western.
now,
within
the
next
couple
of
weeks,
noto
gave
to
chatley
the
instructions
concerning
the
necessity
for
chatley
to
stay
at
home
from
midnight
until
early
in
the
morning
or
daylight
and
that
a
person
would
come
and
identify
himself
by
a
pseudonym.
he
would
make
a
phone
call
and
would
then
leave,
come
back
with
the
person
who
is
being
harbored
and
the
person
would
stay
there
for
three
or
four
days
at
which
time,
he
would
leave
and
then
continue
on
his
way.
now,
this
expected
harboring
never
came
on
but
in
conjunction
with
the
party's
underground
activities
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
sir?
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
say
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
oh,
when
noto
first
explained
to
chatley
when
he
asked
him
if
he
would
put
this
man
up.
he
explained
to
him
that
this
person,
one
of
our
top
officials,
one
of
our
top
people,
was
on
the
land
in
connection
with
the
--
what
the
newspapers
have
called
the
atom
spy
business.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
and
that
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
the
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
on
land
from
the
police.
he
was
fleeing
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
from
the
police
and
it
was
necessary
that
he
get
out
of
the
country.
now,
for
one
--
for
what
reason
we
don't
know
but
this
anticipated
harboring
for
which
noto
laying
chatley's
home
up.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
no,
we
--
that's
--
there's
no
indication
of
that
in
the
record.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
rosenberg
case
was
--
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
--
first
brought
in
1950.
mr.
kevin
t.
maroney
that's
correct,
sir.
now,
on
the
--
the
entire
record,
we
think
that
--
that
the
--
the
evidence
here
satisfies
what
the
court,
in
discussing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
the
yates
case
said
was
the
type
of
thing
where
the
jury,
given
proper
instructions
such
as
we're
given
here,
might
reasonably
conclude
that
the
--
that
the
teachings
were
not
abstract
but
were
in
the
--
in
the
nature
of
an
incitement
through
action
in
the
future.
the
--
they're
--
they're
being
proper
instructions.
the
court
having
charged
the
jury
that
they
must
find
that
the
advocacy
must
be
of
such
a
nature
as
to
incitement.
the
standard
of
review
then,
only
is
whether
or
not
a
--
a
--
the
jury
could've
reasonably
have
so
found,
not
whether
the
court
would
so
find
or
would
agree
necessary
with
the
jury,
but
whether
or
not
the
jury's
determination
could
be
said
on
the
evidence
to
be
unreasonable,
if
it
is
reasonable
and
then
of
course,
it
would
have
to
stand.
