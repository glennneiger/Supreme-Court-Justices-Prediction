well
mr.
davis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
go
beyond
that.
you
go
beyond
that,
don't
you?
you
asked
us
to
give
content
to
a
membership
which
is
not
membership
per
se,
whatever
that
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
didn't
you
tell
us
yesterday
that
your
position
was
that
because
of
4
(f),
there
maybe
no
constitution
of
the
one
who
was
a
member
per
se.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
what
you
want
us
then
to
do
is
give
content
to
something
which
is
not
membership
per
se.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
--
you
--
i
see.
then
your
position
is
that
whatever
may
be
membership,
before
you
get
that
which
is
criminal
under
the
smith
act,
you
have
the
elements,
the
knowledge
and
intent.
