mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
will
address
myself
first
to
a
paragraph
in
the
court's
order
for
rehearing
which
i
did
not
reach
yesterday.
that
is
the
question
dealing
with
the
application
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine.
the
question
as
it
was
stated
in
the
court's
order
reads,
whether
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
as
interpreted
by
counsel
has
application
to
the
membership
clause.
however,
with
respect
to
the
accused,
are
with
respect
to
the
society,
group
or
assembly
of
persons
described
in
the
statute,
if
that
will
hold
whether
such
doctrine
was
or
can
now
be
properly
applied
in
this
case.
in
the
dennis
case,
judge
hand
held
that
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
as
interpreted
by
him
to
meet
that
situation
did
apply
to
a
conspiracy
to
organize
a
group
to
advocate
violent
overthrow
and
did
apply
to
a
conspiracy
to
advocate
violent
overthrow.
and
he
specifically
found
that
on
the
record
in
that
case,
a
clear
and
present
danger
then
existed.
now,
in
the
principal
opinion
of
the
four
justices
on
the
majority
side
of
this
court
and
there
was
no
opinion
for
the
court
in
the
dennis
case,
but
in
the
principal
opinion
in
which
four
justices
erred.
the
judge
hand's
formulation
of
the
rule
and
of
the
application
to
that
set
of
circumstances
was
specifically
affirmed.
the
concurring
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
however
placed
more
weight
on
the
congressional
determination
that
speech
should
be
regulated
in
this
case
and
less
emphasis
upon
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
as
applied
by
a
court.
it
is
our
position
that
this
doctrine
should
apply
to
the
membership
clause
in
precisely
the
same
to
the
--
precisely
the
same
extent
that
is
applied
to
the
organizing
clause
or
the
conspiracy
clause.
if
constitutional
limitations
on
interferences
with
speech
require
some
such
overwriting
limitations
and
the
court
has
generally
held
that
it
do,
then
it
seems
as
though
they
should
apply
to
all
aspects
of
the
smith
act
and
reasonable
of
the
application
should
be
made
here.
i
think
that
some
danger
in
--
in
making
this
application
in
the
--
in
the
original
language
of
the
rule,
i
think
that
judge
hand
was
carrying
through
the
spirit
of
the
rule
but
certainly
varying
it
from
its
original
applications.
but
for
the
present
purposes
i
think
that
you
do
get
a
sufficient
protection
if
you
accept
that
rule.
that
is,
that
in
each
case
that
must
be
asked
whether
the
gravity
of
the
evil
discounted
by
its
improbability
justifies
such
invasion
of
free
speech
as
is
necessary
to
avoid
danger.
mr.
john
f.
davis
what
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
how
--
how
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
only
way
that
i
know
that
when
you
find
out
what
it
means
is
to
find
out
how
it
was
applied
to
the
original
schenck
case,
to
the
gitlow
case,
the
whitney
case
and
how
--
and
the
american
communications
against
douds.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
there's
been
a
very
real
change
in
the
application
in
--
in
this
rule
and
i
think
its
--
i
think
particularly
in
the
--
in
the
gitlow
case,
that
today
we
could
hardly
say
--
would
hardly
say
that
this
was
a
very
real
danger
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
--
its
--
we
must
consider
in
some
of
these
cases
that
the
danger
that
was
contemplated
wasn't
danger
of
overthrow
of
the
government
by
--
by
force
and
violence.
instead,
the
danger
which
was
involved
in
the
debs
case,
the
abrams
case
was
interference,
a
lesser
interference
and
overthrow,
but
an
interference
was
recruitment
and
all
that
was
necessary
in
order
to
find
a
clear
and
present
danger
in
that
case
was,
if
there
was
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
there
would
be
some
affirmative
interference
with
enlistment
and
recruitment.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
yes.
it's
again
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
congress
has
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
the
present
--
in
--
in
the
case
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
--
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
his
word
--
now,
in
--
in
the
first
place,
justice
holmes
was
dealing
not
with
the
smith
act
or
one
of
the
state
acts
which
are
similar
to
it.
he
was
deal
--
dealing
with
an
act
which
deals
with
--
with
interfering
with
the
draft
in
carrying
on
the
--
the
war.
and
his
words
were,
his
specific
words
were,
the
question
in
every
case
of
whether
the
words
used
are
used
in
such
circumstances
and
are
of
such
a
nature
as
to
create
a
clear
and
present
danger
that
they
will
bring
about
the
substantive
evils
that
congress
has
a
right
to
prevent
and
here
he
was
talking,
i
think
mr.
justice
black
in
this
case
about
the
particular
substantive
evils
which
were
legislated
against
in
the
particular
statute
which
he
was
trying
to
find
out.
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
later
on
in
--
when
we
get
to
gitlow
and
whitney,
there
we
get
the
associations
whose
object
is
to
overthrow
government
by
force
and
violence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
stat
--
in
the
statutory
language?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
in
the
two
cases
that
i'm
talking
about
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
gitlow
followed
the
schenck.
it
was
in
gitlow
against
new
york,
it
was
an
--
was
an
application
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
to
the
new
york
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
which
is
the
--
the
original
prototype
of
the
smith
act
and
whitney
followed
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
the
majority
of
the
court
in
gitlow
said,
"here,
we
have
an
act
which
is
addressed
to
free
speech."
the
act
itself
is
suppose
to
--
it
deal
--
deals
with
advocacy.
and
so,
the
majority
of
the
court
said,
"we
have
no
need
of
following
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
because
the
legislature
in
that
case
of
new
york
legislature
has
made
a
determination
that
free
speech
should
be
restricted
to
this
extent."
mr.
justice
holmes
in
his
dissent
joined
in
by
brandeis
in
the
gitlow
case
said
that
he
felt
he
still
had
to
have
a
clear
and
present
danger,
but
here
when
he
was
talking
about
a
clear
and
present
danger,
he
was
talking
about
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
the
offense
which
was
defined
in
the
statute.
and
here
the
offense
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
offense
--
of
the
new
york
statute?
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
language
he
quotes
that
there
must
be
a
clear
and
present
danger
from
--
i
don't
have
the
language
of
it
but
he
--
he
says
that
he
believes
in
the
fact
that
the
language
which
i
have
just
read
which
was
from
the
schenck
case
should
be
applied
in
the
--
to
the
gitlow
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
whitney
case
--
the
whitney
state
--
the
whitney
case,
i
thought
it
was
--
was
justice
brandeis'.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
again
he
said
that
as
in
the
gitlow
case,
he
felt
that
this
rule,
this
clear
and
present
danger
rule
--
i'm
sorry
i
cannot
quote
it
exactly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
should
be
applied
even
though
the
legislature
had
made
a
determination
itself
that
this
speech
should
was
--
be
prohibited.
and
the
difference
between
the
majority
and
the
minority
in
those
cases
was
whether
or
not
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
should
be
applied
when
the
decision
has
been
made
by
the
legislature
in
exactly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
not.
but
it's
a
question
of
application
and
this
court
will
have
to
determine
whether
the
legislative
--
if
even
on
that
basis
they
have
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
reasonable
application
in
--
in
a
--
in
a
degree
that
gets
back
to
the
same
point.
mr.
john
f.
davis
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
from
this
activity.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
what
i
mean
is
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
what
it
means
is
congress
in
adopting
the
smith
act,
adopts
an
act
which
says
that
advocacy
which
is
a
type
of
speech
shall
be
restricted
in
these
ways
and
they
say
it's
necessary.
congress
said
it
is
necessary
because
of
the
subversive
activities
which
are
recurring
and
that
these
organizations
are
controlled
by
foreign
countries
and
it's
proved
dangerous
in
other
countries
and
they
well
proved
dangerous
here.
and
--
and
a
long,
long
basis
of
hearing
from
reports
showing
that
it's
necessary
for
this
type
of
legislation
in
this
restriction
on
free
speech
if
you
please,
in
order
to
protect
the
country
from
the
danger
of
--
of
violent
overthrows.
now,
the
majority
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
a
violent
overthrow
itself.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
now,
congress
has
made
a
determination
when
it
passes
this
act
that
this
limitation
on
free
speech
is
essential
for
the
welfare
of
the
country.
and
the
question
is,
whether
in
that
situation
the
court
should
then,
as
a
new
matter
make
a
determination
of
whether
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
or
whether
they
should
instead
review
and
give
weight
to
the
determination
by
the
congress
that
there
is
a
clear
and
present
danger
in
that
for
this
necessity
of
restriction
on
free
states.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
very
true.
i
think
that
the
court
would
have
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
such
a
change
that
its
now
--
although
constitutional
when
passed
that
it
--
in
not
--
in
being
applied
at
the
present
time,
there
is
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
that
this
is
the
refinement
on
--
on
the
weight
to
be
given
the
decision
of
congress
rather
than
a
third
approach
to
it.
although,
you
can
cut
this
kind
of
argument
and
then
you
kind
of
(inaudible)
but
it
--
that's
--
i
would
think
that
this
was
a
--
was
a
refinement
on
the
--
in
giving
weight
to
the
congressional
finding.
the
second
part
of
the
court's
questions
here
is
whether
the
test,
whatever
test
it
should
be
and
i
think
there's
some
danger
in
tying
it
down
to
specific
words,
but
whether
the
test
should
be
applied
to
the
accused
or
to
the
group.
now,
here
we
have
a
(inaudible)
different
opinion
with
petitioners,
both
petitioners
in
--
in
scales
and
in
noto
because
we
think
it's
perfectly
obvious
that
the
application
under
this
statute
should
be
to
the
group
rather
than
to
the
individual.
in
this
respect,
the
offenses
charged
here
are
comparable
to
the
conspiracy
statute.
it's
a
type
of
statute
which
attacks
the
effect
of
group
activity
although
the
individual
action
of
any
one
of
the
members
of
the
group
cannot
itself
be
said
to
result
in
the
--
in
the
effect
which
is
to
be
prevented.
in
the
ordinary
conspiracy
case
which
we're
all
familiar
with
and
i
--
i'm
not
asserting
that
this
is
a
conspiracy
case.
it's
of
a
similar
nature.
in
the
ordinary
conspiracy
case,
the
individuals
involved
very
likely
cannot
bring
about
the
--
the
evil
plan
which
the
group
has
planned
and
it
couldn't
prove
that
anyone
of
them
was
primarily
responsible
and
it
isn't
important
that
you
should.
and
all
that
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it's
not
a
strange
concept
to
hold
each
one
of
these
individuals
responsible
for
the
group
actions
to
which
he
contributes
even
though
you
do
not
prove
that
there's
any
clear
and
present
danger
from
his
particular
activity,
the
group
activity
which
we
are
looking
at.
now,
i
wish
to
return
for
just
a
minute
to
what
we
were
talking
about
yesterday
as
the
activity
factor
in
defining
membership.
i
don't
think
that
this
needs
be
considered
as
a
complicated
--
complicating
additional
element
in
the
crime.
congress
has
prescribed
certain
action
and
it
has
used
the
term
membership.
and
it's
impossible
for
us
to
abide
this
act
to
facts
of
individual
cases
without
giving
some
meaning
to
that
term
membership.
now
possibly,
it
could
have
been
construed
to
mean
that
the
person
was
carried
and
enlist
on
the
party
role
for
the
communist
party
then
he
would
be
a
member.
but,
in
the
first
place
it's
far
from
clear
that
there
are
any
party
roles
in
this
entirely
--
seems
entirely
foreign
to
what
congress
intended
that
they
would
want
to
impose
a
criminal
liability
on
an
individual
because
the
party
has
put
him
on
this
role.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
only
evidence
in
--
in
these
cases
so
far
as
i
know
is
it
was
50
cents.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
well
i
--
yes,
i
think
the
court
has
to
give
some
content,
your
honor
because
--
i
don't
--
i
--
i
think
that
the
term
membership
isn't
--
isn't
self-defining.
i
think
it's
got
to
be
applied
to
particular
facts
in
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
particular
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
well,
as
far
as
this
--
as
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
this
--
i
--
i'm
not
sure
that
active
membership
couldn't
well
be
called
membership
per
se.
i'm
trying
to
give
the
--
the
definition
of
what
membership
is
and
i
think
that
active
membership
might
well
be
called,
could
be
called.
but
the
--
the
reason
that
the
smith
act
goes
beyond
membership
per
se
is
because
it
requires
under
the
statute
knowledge
of
the
purpose
of
the
organization
and
under
the
interpretation
given
in
the
dennis
case,
it
requires
a
specific
intent
to
carry
out
those
purposes.
and
these
are
the
additional
elements
that
show
that
membership
per
se
is
not
sufficient
but
i
am
trying
to
believe
that
my
present
argument
as
to
membership,
meaning
active
membership
would
include
--
that
active
membership
would
be
--
couldn't
be
considered
membership
per
se.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
and
intent
in
the
sense
of
the
--
of
the
dennis
case
of
an
--
in
specific
intent
to
see
that
the
illegal
objectives
of
the
party
is
carried
out.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
--
in
many
cases,
yes
but
not
in
all
cases.
now,
of
course
it
won't
come
within
the
organizing
factor,
that's
been
thrown
out
so
that
we
can
now
deal
with
conspiracy
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
i
think
that
--
i
don't
think
it
would
necessarily
prove
the
advocacy
feature.
this
is
only
a
question
of
whether
it
can
prove
the
conspiracy
feature
as
such.
a
conspiracy
has
always
been
defined
in
--
as
mr.
--
general
taylor
points
out
yesterday,
american
law
institute
sticks
to
the
thought
that
there
must
be
an
agreement.
there
must
be
a
specific
conscious
agreement
of
--
rather
than
as
we
have
in
this
case,
a
mere
association
together.
it's
very
close
and
i'm
not
sure
you
couldn't
prove
a
conspiracy
in
almost
all
of
these
cases
but
there
are
technical
differences.
there
is
a
technical
difference
which
at
least
the
american
law
institute
has
recognized
between
the
conspiracy
doctrine
and
just
being
a
--
just
associating
yourself
with
this
group.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
want
to
--
i
wanted
and
i
haven't
been
trying
to
beat
it
up
but
i'm
just
trying
to
interpret
it,
but
the
--
the
--
in
your
--
you're
quite
right,
in
yates,
there
were
two
elements.
we
tried
to
prove
conspiracy
in
two
ways.
we
tried
to
prove
it
once
through
their
participation,
their
--
their
formal
action
in
connection
with
the
party
as
such
and
that
the
nexus
was
then,
what
the
party
itself
proved.
we
also
tried
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
now,
i
think
it's
possible
that
in
this
case
for
example,
certainly
in
the
--
in
view
of
mr.
noto's
conferences
with
--
with
lautner
and
his
appearing
with
his
joining
together
in
--
in
the
various
schools
that
you
could've
planned
the
conspiracy
in
this
case.
you
--
you
do
have
the
overt
and
active
--
well,
you
don't
need
the
overt
and
active
conspiracy
in
the
smith
act.
but
you
do
have
the
joining
together,
the
specific
joining
together
of
this
man
with
the
other
people
to
carry
out
the
aims
of
the
party
and
that
would
--
we
could
have
put
it
under
the
--
the
conspiracy
charge.
it's
a
little
harder.
you've
got
more
to
prove.
you've
got
to
prove
specifically
the
he
did
sit
down
with
other
people
and
do
certain
things.
i
think
it's
proved
in
the
case,
but
i
--
the
government
didn't
undertake
to
make
that
proof
in
the
case.
they
undertook
to
make
the
proof
only
that
he
was
unknowing
an
active
member
and
whether
his
activity
was
in
conjunction
with
somebody
else
and
did
not
--
didn't
undertake
to
prove.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
wasn't.
in
this
case
that
--
the
--
the
court,
the
district
court
told
the
jury,
"you've
got
to
find
that
he
was
a
member."
and
they
didn't
attempt
to
define
member
in
any
way
because
they
said
it's
not
--
there's
no
--
in
effect
they
said,
"this
is
conceded
and
you
don't
need
to
--
well,
i
think
he
said
in
so
many
words.
you
don't
need
to
be
worry
about
membership,
so
there
was
no
occasion
by
him
to
define
membership
or
asked
the
jury
to
make
any
findings.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes
if
you
think
you
can
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
because
--
on
the
theory
that
the
elements
of
the
crime
was
properly
defined
and
with
the
nature
of
the
party
knowing
membership
in
it
with
intent.
now,
there
was
no
dispute
in
this
--
in
this
record
as
to
membership,
the
nature
of
the
membership.
he
was
concededly
an
--
an
officer
for
years,
from
1933
on.
concededly
he
was
not
so
that
when
the
judge
came
to
instruct
the
jury,
he
could
tell
the
jury,
"these
are
the
elements,
the
nature
of
the
body
and
membership."
but
there
is
no
dispute
about
membership
therefore
i
don't
have
to
define
the
terms.
they
don't
have
to
ask
you
to
do
anything
about
it.
you
can
--
in
effect
you
could
--
he
was
telling
them
--
you
can
come
in
and
--
and
find
as
far
as
the
--
the
conviction
is
concerned.
you
can
find
membership
without
any
--
anymore
questions,
its
not
in
doubt.
not
questions
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no
because
there
was
no
--
there
was
just
no
issue
in
the
case
about
the
--
about
noto's
activities
in
the
party.
there
wasn't
any
chance
of
the
jury
finding
anything
else.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
is
membership
of
course.
there's
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
but
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
membership
was
--
well,
membership
plus
knowledge
plus
intent
is
--
are
the
elements.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
because
the
statute
says
with
knowledge
and
the
court
in
--
in
dennis
says
with
intent
so
that
these
are
necessary
and
the
instructions
in
--
in
dennis,
the
intent
was
all
we
talked
about,
the
necessity
of
proving
intent.
but
if
we
comprehend
activity
as
a
part
of
what
the
word
membership
means,
if
membership
means
in
effect,
active
membership
rather
than
nominal
passive
membership.
if
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case,
if
all
of
the
--
if
all
of
the
evidence
is
that
he
was
an
active
member
and
if
the
court
says
the
jury
as
far
as
membership
goes,
as
far
as
being
a
member
is
concerned,
there's
no
--
there's
no
issue
for
you
to
decide.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
we
--
we
asked
the
court
to
instruct
it.
it
seems
as
though
it
was
--
as
thought
it
--
it
would
bolster
the
case
to
have
an
--
have
an
instruction
in
the
jury
findings.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
were
necessary
in
scales.
if
it
were
necessary
in
scales
by
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
wasn't
formulated
as
--
as
clearly
as
it
was
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
that's
subjective.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
true.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
the
fact
although
i
may
say
that
we
find
before
the
articulation
or
formulation
that
the
government
in
various
(inaudible)
places
in
its
brief,
perhaps
inadvertently
refers
to
activity,
of
course
with
--
that
--
as
--
as
an
element
in
the
party.
mr.
john
f.
davis
withheld.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
