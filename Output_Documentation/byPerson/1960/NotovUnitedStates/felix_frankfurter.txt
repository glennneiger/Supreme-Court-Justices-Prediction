justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
you
to
answer
justice
harlan
that
the
trial
court
instructions
did
satisfy
yates'
advocacy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
indication
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
not
necessary
to
meet
the
yates'
standard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
mean
about
what's
fixed
out.
it
--
i'll
come
to
that
sentence.
is
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
explicit
reference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
449?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
understood
that
to
mean
that
--
that
--
what,
i
think
what
justice
stewart
have
already
put
to
you,
namely
that
--
that
yates
dealt
with
the
advocacy
of
the
--
the
requirement
of
and
proof
of
advocacy
by
the
party
and
that's
--
that's
what
(inaudible)
said
with
there,
and
here,
you're
dealing
with
membership
which
merely
require
it
is
not
a
job,
assuming
that's
sufficient
you're
probably
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
may
--
may
ask
you?
if
you
forgive
me.
the
various
sentence,
after
your
sentence,
the
crime
to
which
appellant
was
indicted
brought
to
trial
and
convicted
is
what
determined
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
not
on
another
similar
even
related
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
related
crime
is
advocacy
by
the
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
you
have
to
argue
one
more
thing
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
assume
you're
right,
assume
you're
right,
trial
court
properly
charged
the
jury,
the
evidence
sustained
the
charge.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
that
indicate
that
a
law
standard
of
proof
of
means,
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
i'm
saying,
i'm
--
one
--
one
point
of
your
thought.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you
have
for
me
to
deal
with
this
(inaudible)
assume
you're
right.
you're
appealing
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
record
sustain
the
correctness
in
what
the
trial
court
did
and
the
evidence
sustained
that
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
finish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
evidence
--
if
the
charge
was
right
and
the
evidence
sustained
the
charge,
however
wrong
the
court
of
appeals
maybe
if
this
court
thinks
the
charge
of
the
district
court
was
right
and
the
evidence
sustained
with
or
within
period
at
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
was
settled
between
the
government
and
yourself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
was
not
part
of
the
statute.
that
was
not
part
of
the
proscribed
offense.
that
was
not
charged
in
the
indictmen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mention
--
do
you
(inaudible)
mr.
abt.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
disagree
with
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
party
himself
has
nothing
further,
it
wasn't
(inaudible)
justice
felix

justice

oh,
yes.
justice

deviation
and

(inaudible)
exceptionalism
to

theory
about
where

comes,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
what
that
would
mean
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
telling
me
--
do
you
mind
directing
me
where
i
can
find
out
what
content
you
give
to
that
phrase,
clear
and
present
danger?
where
should
i
go
to
find
out
what
it
contains
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
i'm
to
apply
it?
what
it
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
if
the
original
schenck
and
douds
case,
a
real
danger
to
the
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
real
danger
in
this
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
phrase
was
first
used,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
danger
to
the
country,
clear
and
present
danger
become
substantive
subject
matter
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
congress
referenced
to
which
--
the
congress
legislature.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
that
stuff
about
danger
to
the
country
is
an
infusion
that
was
as
far
from
judges
holmes'
(inaudible)
from
anything
i
can
imagine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
--
what's
the
word
he
used?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said,
in
the
words
that
he
used
to
explain
his
mind.
he
said
a
clear
and
present
danger
becomes
substantive
subject
matter
that
congress
can
deal
with.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wasn't
talking
about
overthrowing
the
government
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
know
whether
there
were
any
words
in
what
he
said
that
indicated
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
other
means
of
knowing
except
the
words
he
used.
i
mean,
defined
what
the
danger
was
supposed
to
be.
it
was
in
his
reference,
become
substantive
matter
regarding
which
congress
conversed
with.
are
those
his
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
precluding,
not
precluding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
knowing
gitlow
because
that
receded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
whitney
followed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
nobody
has
suggested
that
in
this
field
of
judicial
review
isn't
the
same
as
it
is
in
other
things
namely
that
the
legislative
word
isn't
(inaudible).
has
anyone
suggested
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
true
as
to
all
this
--
of
this
type
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
legislation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
challenged
under
the
due
process
clause,
(inaudible)
regulation
statute
is
found
constitutional
by
this
clause
during
the
war
and
later
on
was
found
no
longer
to
satisfy
the
requirement.
that
it
had
become
by
--
of
course
by
circumstances
clearly
the
advocacy.
