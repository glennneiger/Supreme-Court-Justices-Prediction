mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
like
scales,
involves
a
conviction
under
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
the
two
indictments
are
identical
in
form
and
were
returned
within
about
10
days
of
each
other
in
1954.
noto
was
tried
in
the
western
district
of
new
york
in
1956,
about
a
year
after
the
first
trial
in
scales
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
in
the
second
circuit
in
1958
shortly
after
the
affirmance
of
scales'
conviction
by
the
fourth
circuit.
the
two
cases
raised
the
same
questions
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
and
the
effect
of
section
4
(f)
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
and
i
shall
have
something
to
add
to
what
has
already
been
said
on
these
questions
a
little
bit
later.
however,
i
do
not
think
that
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
these
questions
in
this
case
because
under
the
standards
of
yates
versus
united
states
and
nowak
versus
united
states,
the
record
in
this
case
unequivocally
demands
the
--
a
judgment
of
acquittal
for
the
petitioner.
at
the
trial,
the
petitioner
did
not
dispute
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
that
he
had
held
leading
positions
in
the
party
in
its
western
new
york
organization.
the
indictment,
like
the
scales
indictment,
contained
no
allegation
and
unlike
scales,
the
court
here
gave
no
instruction
with
respect
to
what
the
government
now
calls
the
activity
factor.
since
the
government
didn't
discover
the
existence
of
that
factor
as
an
ingredient
of
the
offence
until
several
years
after
noto's
conviction.
the
issues
therefore
at
the
trial
were
whether
petitioner
have
the
knowledge
and
the
intent
charged
in
the
indictment.
the
indictment
charges
that
noto
had
knowledge
that
the
communist
party
was
engaged
in
advocating
forcible
overthrow.
this
court
held
in
yates
at
the
advocacy
proscribed
by
the
smith
act,
his
advocacy
of
action
as
distinguished
from
advocacy
of
belief.
obviously,
petitioner
couldn't
know
that
the
party
was
engaged
in
such
advocacy,
that
is
to
say
advocacy
of
action,
if
in
fact
it
was
not.
accordingly,
the
prosecution
was
required
to
prove
that
the
party
incited
action
for
forcible
overthrow
and
the
trial
court
so
instructed
the
jury.
this,
of
course,
is
a
proposition
with
respect
to
the
communist
party
that
this
court
held
that
the
government
had
been
unable
to
prove
in
the
yates
case,
stating
that
the
record
on
this
issue
was
strikingly
deficient.
similarly,
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
same
proposition
had
not
been
proved
in
two
smith
act
conspiracy
cases
that
followed
the
yates
decision.
in
the
present
case,
however,
the
court
below
never
considered
whether
the
evidence
in
this
case
supply
to
deficiency
which
had
been
found
in
the
records
in
these
three
earlier
cases.
instead,
it
held
that
the
incitement
to
action
standard
is
inapplicable
to
prosecutions
under
the
membership
clause.
this
appears
both
from
the
court's
explicit
statement
to
that
effect
and
from
its
failure
to
mention
or
apply
the
standards
in
delineating
the
issues
and
discussing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and
i'll
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
record
at
page
449
for
the
explicit
statement
by
the
court
and
439
to
442
for
delineation
of
the
issues
and
discussion
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
court
seems
to
have
thought
that
yates
is
inapplicable
because
the
accused
in
a
membership
case
has
not
charged
himself
with
advocating
anything
and
because
for
some
reason
that
the
court
never
stated,
the
incitement
standard
does
not
apply
to
the
advocacy
of
the
organization.
by
reading
incitement
out
of
the
membership
clause,
the
court
sustained
the
conviction
on
a
record
which
has
its
own
statement
of
the
evidence
at
the
point
in
which
decision
to
which
i've
already
referred
the
court
shows,
differs
in
no
--
nor
in
significant
respect
whatsoever
from
the
record
which
yates
stated
was
strikingly
deficient.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
sir.
i've
already
indicated
that
trial
court
gave
an
instruction
on
incitement
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct,
your
honor
but
never
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
instant
case.
contrary
to
the
court
below,
the
solicitor
general
here
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
that
--
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
the
--
the
issue
is
not
as
to
advocacy
but
as
to
the
character
of
the
advocacy
and
i
think
it's
perfectly
apparent
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
as
i
--
as
i
read
that,
that's
--
that's
what
the
government
says
from
its
reading
of
the
opinion,
justice
stewart.
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
court
never
mentions
the
word
incitement
or
--
or
advocacy
of
action,
anywhere
in
delineating
the
issues
and
discussing
the
evidence.
and
it
specifically
says
that
yates,
in
its
own
decisions
in
silverman
and
jackson
are
inapplicable.
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
could
--
never
have
viewed
the
case
the
way
it
did
if
it
had
thought
that
the
incitement
standard
was
applicable.
well,
i'm
going
to
argue
in
any
case
here
is,
irrespective
of
the
view
taken
by
the
court
below
that
incitement
obviously
was
approved.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
your
honor.
trial
court
instructed
on
incitement.
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
my
point
of
it.
but
the
review
below
is
never
a
proper
review
because
the
(inaudible)
standard
applies.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
--
i
think
it's
fixed
out
all
over
the
opinion,
your
honor.
first
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
court's
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
at
page
--
at
page,
your
honor,
at
page
449
of
the
record.
the
court
says
that
the
--
that
the
incitement
standard
of
yates
as
well
as
of
jackson
and
the
silverman
is
inapplicable.
mr.
john
j.
abt
44
--
449,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
meant,
you
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
justice
harlan.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no.
the
government
said
they've
satisfied
yates,
your
honor.
that
makes
the
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
that
makes
--
makes
it
all
the
more
astonishing
if
the
court
decided
if
they
have
reference.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
--
i
--
i
can
only
express
mine
as
my
view.
i
--
and
--
and
i
think
that
after
you
read
the
court's
statement
of
the
issues
and
the
court's
analysis
of
the
evidence,
all
of
which
is
done
without
mentioning
the
--
the
incitement
standard,
that
you'll
conclude
as
i
conclude
it
at
the
court
and
--
and
couple
that
with
the
fact
that
said
that
yates
was
inapplicable.
you'll
conclude
as
i
conclude
it
that
the
court
did
not
believe
that
the
incitement
standard
had
any
place
in
the
states
at
all.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
my
position
your
honor,
that's
not
my
--
that's
not
my
whole
position.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
correct.
mr.
john
j.
abt
then
i
--
then
i
have
no
point,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
--
i
apologize.
mr.
john
j.
abt
absolutely
mr.
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
all
the
evidence
is
in
the
record,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
one
single
volume.
and
i
now
--
i
now
proceed
to
argue
that
--
from
the
evidence,
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
applied
the
incitement
standard
as
--
i'm
sure
that
this
court
will.
it
could
not
have
sustained
the
conviction
because
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
citing
of
this
record.
mr.
john
j.
abt
this
has
all
of
the
significant
of
it.
that's
right
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well
of
course,
there's
a
record.
i
--
i
did
not
--
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
black
to
ask
me
otherwise.
and
the
record
has
some
more
material
in
it.
well,
if
the
government
and
ourselves
are
satisfied
and
all
of
the
significant
evidence
in
the
case
has
been
printed
in
the
record.
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh,
yes
of
course.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
sure
the
government
will
agree
--
i
--
i
understood
that
from
your
question
at
this
point.
i'm
sure
the
government
will
agree
with
me
that
you
don't
have
to
go
outside
of
the
printed
record.
indeed,
the
printed
record
has
been
more
than
generous
in
reproducing
this
file
we
have.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes
but
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
all
the
exhibits
of
any
significance
were
read
to
the
jury
and
public
has
read
to
them,
for
the
jury
has
been
(inaudible).
let
me
say,
as
far
as
the
exhibits
are
concerned,
your
honors,
unfortunately
are
more
than
familiar
with
all
the
exhibits
because
they
consist
of
same
books
that
were
happens
in
the
yates.
my
principle
brief
made
a
point-by-point
comparison
of
the
evidence
concerning
the
advocacy
of
the
communist
party
in
this
case
and
in
yates.
and
this
can
now
very
readily
be
done
by
the
court
from
the
appendices
to
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
and
in
the
yates
case
in
which
the
evidence
concerning
party
advocacy
is
summarized.
in
both
cases,
the
principle
evidence
on
this
issue
was
introduced
through
the
prosecution's
ubiquitous
witness
lautner,
who
has
given
substantially
the
same
testimony
in
every
smith
act
case
since
dennis.
the
evidence
consisted
of
the
following.
first,
the
facts
concerning
the
reconstitution
of
the
communist
party
in
1945
and
of
three-dedication
to
the
principles
of
marxism
and
leninism.
second,
the
so-called
practical
writings
of
marx,
engels,
lenin,
and
stalin,
declarations
of
a
communist
international
published
in
the
1920s
and
books
and
articles
of
american
communist.
third,
lopez
testimony
that
he
had
read
this
books
and
articles
and
that
some
of
them
had
been
studied
in
party
schools
after
1945.
fourth,
evidence
concerning
the
organizational
principle
of
democratic
centralism,
which
requires
strict
adherence
to
party
decisions.
fifth,
evidence
again
primarily
in
the
testimony
of
lautner
concerning
the
establishment
of
a
so-called
underground
party
organization
equipping
it
with
mimeograph
machines
and
printing
presses
and
arranging
hideouts
for
possible
use
by
party
leaders.
and
sixth,
and
finally,
evidence
that
the
parties
press
the
need
of
recruiting
members
and
influencing
workers
in
the
basic
industries
of
the
nation.
my
principle
brief
challenged
the
government
to
find
out
any
significant
differences
between
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
in
yates
from
the
subject
of
party
advocacy.
the
solicitor
general
relegates
his
reply
to
a
footnote.
he
says
that
to
compare
the
evidence
in
the
two
cases,
and
i
quote,
"is
misleading
and
unrewarding."
on
three
--
page
39,
note
12.
i
can
readily
understand
that
he
finds
the
comparison
unrewarding
but
he
doesn't
tell
us
why
it
should
be
misleading.
he
acknowledges
that
the
pattern
of
the
evidence
in
the
two
cases
is
similar
but
he
asserts
from
in
the
same
breadth
that
the
factual
pattern
in
this
case
is
unique.
certainly,
there
was
nothing
unique
in
lautner's
twice-told
tale
nor
was
there
was
anything
unique
in
the
testimony
of
five
additional
witnesses
who
did
not
appear
in
the
yates
case.
the
government
says
that
the
significant
aspect
of
the
testimony
of
these
five
witnesses
related
to
industrial
concentration
and
the
underground.
this
evidence
is
summarized
at
pages
37
to
38
of
the
government's
brief
on
which
it
will
readily
appear
that
the
witnesses
added
nothing
to
what
lautner
have
provided
too
on
these
subjects.
the
government
seems
to
acknowledge
that
the
evidence
concerning
party
instruction
and
marxism
and
leninism,
taken
by
itself,
shows
no
more
than
the
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine.
it
argues
however,
that
this
instruction
is
transmuted
into
incitement
to
action
by
the
party's
program
of
industrial
concentration
and
the
establishment
of
an
underground
organization.
but
to
say
this
is
not
the
distinguish
yates
but
merely
to
resurrect
the
arguments
that
yates
rejected.
indeed,
while
the
government
argues
here
that
it
has
met
the
incitement
standard,
its
action
in
other
smith
act
cases
relies
its
words.
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
yates,
12
of
the
13
pending
smith
act
conspiracy
prosecutions
were
terminated
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
four
of
these
were
disposed
off
by
directions
for
judgments
of
acquittal
in
the
second
and
tenth
circuits.
in
the
remaining
eight
cases,
the
indictments
were
dismissed
on
motion
of
the
government
with
the
explanation
that
the
yates
standard
could
not
be
met.
this
would
seem
to
be
an
acknowledgement
that
the
government
cannot
cure
the
deficiency
in
the
yates
record
that
the
court
--
that
this
court
pointed
out.
for
--
if
evidence
were
available
to
prove
what
was
not
proved
there,
that
is
that
the
communist
party
incites
violent
overthrow
and
therefore,
constitutes
the
conspiratorial
group,
it's
just
inconceivable
that
the
government
would
have
abandoned
the
effort
to
convict
at
least
some
of
the
party
leaders
who
were
named
in
these
indictments
as
participants
in
that
conspiracy.
thus,
while
the
government
here
formally
contends
that
yates
is
distinguishable.
what
it
really
is
asking
is
that
the
court
overruled
the
yates
decision.
yet,
it
advances
and
can
advance,
no
reason
for
this
court
to
do
so.
indeed,
this
would
be
a
most
inappropriate
case
even
to
urge
the
court
to
overrule
yates
because
the
fact
is
that
here,
the
evidence
would
be
insufficient,
even
a
proof
of
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine
by
the
communist
party
were
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
statute.
this
is
so,
because
in
this
case,
the
government
introduced
no
evidence
that
the
party
advocated
forcible
overthrow
even
in
the
sense
of
advocacy
of
abstract
doctrine
within
the
period
of
the
statute
limitations
that
is
in
september
1,
1951
for
the
date
of
the
indictments.
the
only
evidence
of
party
advocacy
was
the
elimination
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon?
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
it's
a
little
over
three
years,
your
honor,
because
the
four
--
the
five-year
statute
had
been
passed
in
the
interim.
mr.
john
j.
abt
because
of
the
--
the
peculiar
effect
of
the
increase
of
the
statute
of
limitations
from
three
years
to
five
years
shortly
before
the
indictment
in
this
case
was
referred.
but
works
out
there
automatic,
which
is
three
years,
two
months
and
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
it's
complicated
to
go
into.
mr.
john
j.
abt
if
i
could
even
remember
it
now,
i
don't
remember
the
argument
but
that
--
but
that
what
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
abt
we
all
agree
that
the
statutes
runs
from
september
1st
of
1960.
the
only
evidence
the
party
advocacy
within
the
limitations
period
was
offered
by
the
petitioner.
it
consisted
of
writings
by
the
chairman
of
the
party,
advocating
the
establishment
of
socialism
by
peaceful
parliamentary
means.
the
court
below
ignored
petitioner's
evidence.
it
made
up
for
absence
of
any
prosecution
evidence
on
the
subject
by
invoking
an
inference
and
i
quote
from
the
court's
opinion,
"that
the
character
of
the
party,
as
a
group,
dedicated
to
violent
overthrow
of
the
government,
established
in
prior
years
continued
unaltered
through
the
statutory
period."
and
the
government
here,
likewise,
relies
on
the
same
inference.
but
the
issue
in
this
case
obviously,
is
not
the
general
character
of
the
party
or
to
what
goal
it
was
dedicated
during
the
limitation's
period.
the
issue
is
whether
within
that
period,
the
party
performs
certain
verbal
acts,
the
utterance
or
publication
of
words
advocating
forcible
overthrow.
so
called,
presumption
of
continuance
applies
only
where
the
existence
of
some
condition,
quality
or
tendency
is
in
question.
it
does
not
and
purely,
it
cannot,
at
any
application
for
the
performance
of
an
act
at
a
given
time
is
an
issue.
for
example,
no
lawyer,
in
his
right
mind,
would
argue
that
because
i
had
a
record
of
five
previous
convictions
for
driving
through
a
red
light
at
the
corner
of
16th
and
k
streets
that
it
would
be
presumed
that
i
drove
through
the
same
light
of
some
time
after
september
1,
1960.
it's
just
as
absurd
to
argue
that
if
the
jury
had
found
that
the
communist
party
had
advocated
forcible
overthrow
prior
to
september
1,
1951.
he
was
entitled
to
infer
that
the
party
engaged
in
some
--
in
the
same
advocacy
that
sometime
thereafter.
this
would
substitute
a
presumption
of
guilt
or
the
constitutional
presumption
of
innocence.
moreover,
even
of
such
a
presumption
or
otherwise
permissible
and
i
think
plainly,
it
isn't.
it
was
rebutted
by
the
uncontradicted
evidence
that
petitioner's
advocacy
during
the
limitations
period
was
peaceable.
i
now
turn
to
the
evidence
concerning
petitioner's
knowledge
and
intent
and
for
that
purpose,
i'll
assume
that
the
prosecution
proved
that
the
communist
party
incited
forceful
overthrow
within
the
limitations
period.
even
on
that
assumption,
the
conviction
cannot
stand
where
there
was
a
complete
failure
of
proof
on
the
issue
of
guilty
knowledge
and
guilty
intent.
prosecution
called
nine
witnesses
in
additional
to
lautner.
five
were
former
party
members.
three
of
them
had
joined
the
--
the
party
as
paid
spies
for
the
f.b.i.
the
four
remaining
witnesses
merely
identified
the
petitioner
as
having
lived
and
held
a
factory
job
in
new
jersey
under
another
name
in
the
years
1953
to
1955.
the
prosecution
witnesses
praised
petitioner's
membership
and
activity
in
the
communist
--
in
the
young
communist
league
in
the
communist
party
from
his
high
school
days
in
1933
and
1951.
the
evidence
pictured
him
as
a
devoted
communist
who
believe
in
the
ultimate
victory
of
socialism
in
this
country
but
there's
not
a
suggestion
in
the
record
that
he
so
much
as
predicted
forcible
overthrow,
let
alone
incited
action
that
bring
it
about.
indeed,
the
record
contains
only
one
instance
in
which
a
reference
was
made
to
forcible
overthrow
in
petitioner's
presence.
this
was
said
to
have
occurred
in
1935,
20
years
before
the
return
of
the
indictment.
when
an
instructor
in
a
class
conducted
by
the
young
communist
league
stated
that
resort
to
forcible
overthrow
wouldn't
be
historically
necessary.
it
appears
at
page
255
in
the
record.
assuming
the
relevance
and
credibility
of
anything
so
remote,
the
statement
was
no
more
than
a
prediction
about
coming
events
and
clearly
fall
short
--
short
of
any
incitement.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
was
said
to
have
been
made
by
a
teacher
in
a
class
attended
by
the
petitioner.
and
it's
the
worst
thing
there
is
against
the
petitioner
in
entire
way.
the
evidence
for
the
prosecution
showed
that
petitioner
urged
building
the
communist
party
among
workers
in
heavy
industry
in
the
buffalo
area,
that
he
had
dealings
with
three
witnesses
about
the
purchase
and
concealment
of
printing
presses
for
use
in
the
event
that
the
party
was
denied
access
to
commercial
printing
facilities.
they
discussed
the
matter
of
locating
homes
where
people
could
takeaway
refuge
if
they
had
to
go
into
hiding.
and
that
he
himself
moved
with
his
family
to
new
jersey
where
from
1933
to
1935,
he
worked
for
the
goodyear
rubber
company,
i
think
it's
at
stratford
under
an
assumed
name.
none
of
this
evidence
is
relevant
for
the
issue
of
petitioner's
knowledge
and
intent.
mr.
john
j.
abt
that
i
included,
your
honor,
among
this
business
of
arranging
hideouts
for
people
in
case
they've
had
to
use
them.
there
were
some
reference
--
there's
something
about
the
atom
bomb
harboring
somebody,
the
man
never
showed
up
and
nothing
ever
came
to
the
whole
conversation.
it
obviously
had
nothing
to
do
with
that.
it
might
conceivably
have
some
relevance
with
the
conspiracy
to
--
in
that
espionage
or
sabotage
of
the
company
but
it's
not
the
essence
of
the
court.
as
i
say,
none
of
this
evidence
was
relevant
to
the
issue
of
petitioner's
knowledge
or
intent.
there
is
no
evidence
of
the
so-called
underground
engaged
or
plan
to
engage
in
incitement,
to
violence
or
other
unlawful
activities,
much
less
that
petitioner
knew
of
any
such
purpose.
all
that
the
evidence
shows
is
that
elaborate
precautions
were
taken
to
protect
the
party
and
its
members
against
what
was
regarded
as
political
prosecution.
this
measures
may
have
been
ill
advised,
they
have
been
foolish.
certainly,
they
furnish
no
evidence
of
illegality.
the
case
for
the
prosecution
on
the
issues
of
knowledge
and
intent
that
bottom
rest
on
no
more
than
the
following.
first,
that
he
was
familiar
with
the
classical
writings
in
marxism
and
leninism.
second,
that
he
held
positions
of
party
leadership
in
western
new
york
and
third,
that
he
made
a
few
innocuous
remarks,
the
strongest
of
which
i
quoted
from
a
moment
ago.
nowak
versus
united
states
held
a
similar
evidence
including
statements
that
i
think
come
far
closer
to
the
boundary
that
separates
the
advocacy
of
belief
from
advocacy
of
action,
were
insufficient
to
prove
that
the
petitioner
in
that
case
had
knowledge
that
the
communist
party
incites
to
violent
overthrow.
and
schneiderman
versus
united
states
shows
that
similar
evidence
is
likewise
insufficient
to
establish
the
petioner
to
have
the
specific
intent
of
bringing
about
violent
overthrow.
the
government
in
its
brief
studiously
avoids
mentioning
either
of
these
cases.
although
together,
what
the
decision
in
yates
as
i
see
it,
they're
completely
dispositive
of
all
of
the
evidentiary
issues
in
this
--
in
this
case.
on
the
standards
of
these
decisions,
there
was
a
complete
failure
of
proof
as
to
each
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
charge.
the
government
was
undergone
misapprehension
as
to
its
burden
of
proof
under
the
statute
and
the
indictment.
accordingly,
this
is
a
case
whereas
the
court
stated
in
yates,
acquittal
is
unequivocally
demanded.
i
shall
pass
over
the
next
point
argued
in
my
brief
that
the
conviction
must
be
reversed
because
it
was
the
pain
on
the
faces
of
evidence
and
matters
wholly
outside
the
petitioner's
knowledge
and
not
otherwise
connected
up
with
him.
i
argue
the
4
(f)
question
at
some
length
in
my
brief.
and
i'd
like
to
make
only
two
observations
briefly
in
addition
to
what
was
said
here
today
on
that
question.
first,
the
effect
of
4
(f)
on
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
was
by
no
means
inadvertent
as
we
suggested
here
this
morning.
on
the
contrary,
it
was
very
conscious
and
highly
deliberate.
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
which
is
summarized
in
my
brief
at
page
44,
i
think
what
very
clearly
emerges
is
the
fact
that
congress
fully
understood
that
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination
forced
it
to
choose
between
the
registrations
provision
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
on
the
one
hand
and
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act
on
the
hand
as
a
method
of
reaching
members
of
the
communist
party
whose
only
over
deck
consistent
in
membership,
and
that
they
deliberately
chose
the
registration
provisions
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
to
accomplish
that
purpose
and
for
that
reason,
immunize
communist
--
members
of
the
communist
party
from
prosecution
under
the
membership
clause
of
the
smith
act.
something
was
said
this
morning
about
counselman
versus
hitchcock
and
i
shall
argue
tomorrow
in
the
communist
party
case
that
the
registration
provisions
of
the
subversive
activities
control
act
are
unconstitutional
because
they
compel
self-incrimination
and
that
--
and
in
that
connection,
i
point
out
that
section
4
(f)
doesn't
rescue
these
provisions
because
it
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirements
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock.
the
congress
was
fully
aware
of
the
holding
in
counselman
versus
hitchcock
and
its
--
the
text
of
section
4
(f)
was
prepared
with
the
decision
in
that
case
and
mine
at
least
that
congress
had
the
--
had
the
--
the
text
that
had
decision
before
them
because
the
doctrine
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
senate
in
the
minority
report
of
the
senate
which
commented
on
--
on
the
fact
that
section
4
(f)
was
drafted
by
the
senate,
didn't
satisfy
that
doctrine.
and
it
was
called
in
the
attention
of
the
house
by
congressman
sullivan
at
the
time
that
the
4
(f)
was
amended
to
improve
immunization
against
the
prosecution
for
other
criminal
statutes.
and
i
believe
also,
my
recollection
is
that
the
doctrine
of
counselman
versus
hitchcock
was
also
adverted
through
--
in
a
letter
by
then
attorney
general,
now
mr.
justice
clark,
to
congressman
celler
who
was
then
the
chairman
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
so
that
congress
legislated
the
4
(f)
with
counselman
versus
hitchcock
in
mind.
now,
as
i
say,
i'll
argue
tomorrow
that
plainly,
4
(f)
doesn't
satisfy
the
counselman
versus
hitchcock
doctrine.
and
if
that
argument
is
sound
and
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
contend
otherwise,
then
section
4
(f)
failed
to
accomplish
its
ultimate
legislative
purpose.
that
is
to
insulate
the
registration
provisions
from
attack
on
self-incrimination
grounds.
but
that
fact
does
not
militate
against
giving
effect
to
the
limited
immunity
of
section
4
(f)
before
us.
as
mr.
taylor
pointed
out
this
morning,
the
court
was
confronted
with
precisely
this
situation
and
united
states
versus
bryan
or
bryan
versus
united
states
and
adams
versus
maryland.
both
of
those
cases
involve
section
3486
of
the
criminal
code
which
provides
that
no
testimony
by
a
witness
before
a
congressional
committee
shall
be
used
as
evidence
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
that
statute
was
originally
inactive
for
the
purpose
of
providing
an
immunity
which
would
permit
the
compulsion
of
incriminating
testimony
before
and
--
from
witnesses
before
congressional
committees.
purpose
was
nullified
by
the
court's
decision
in
counselman
versus
hitchcock
holding
that
the
immunity
conferred
by
this
section
wasn't
coextensive
with
a
privilege.
nevertheless,
the
court
is
held
in
both
the
bryan
and
adams
cases
that
effect
must
be
given
to
the
limited
immunity
which
section
3486
reports.
and
so
in
the
present
case,
i
submit
that
there
would
be
no
inconsistency
in
holding
on
the
one
hand
that
section
4
(f)
bars
the
prosecution
of
communist
under
the
membership
clause
but
at
the
same
time,
deciding
in
the
communist
party
case
that
the
immunity
conferred
by
4
(f)
is
not
broad
enough
to
foreclose
a
claim
of
the
privilege
as
a
defense
to
registration
under
the
subversive
activities
control
act.
turning
now
to
the
constitutional
issues,
i
want
first
to
discuss
the
questions
posed
in
the
court's
order
for
re-argument
with
respect
to
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine.
as
i
--
as
i
understood
mr.
davis
this
afternoon,
he
conceded
that
the
membership
clause
must
satisfy
that
doctrine.
if
we
state
my
conclusion
at
the
outset,
it's
my
view
that
the
term
present
danger
clause
is
applicable
and
is
violated
by
the
membership
clause
both
as
a
clause
as
written
and
as
the
government
proposes
to
embellish
it
with
an
attempt
and
activity
and
if
this
is
so,
whether
the
doctrine
has
given
the
holmes,
brandeis
interpretation
or
whether
it's
given
the
hand
and
vinson
interpretation.
i
suggest
that
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
state
with
some
precision
to
make
sure
of
the
conduct
which
the
membership
clause
proscribes.
it
doesn't
punish
and
accuse
for
its
own
advocacy.
both
has
written
and
is
now
embellished
by
the
government.
it
punishes
him
because
of
the
advocacy
of
other
members
of
the
group
for
which
he
belongs.
accordingly,
it
is
not
advocacy
but
association
that
the
membership
clause
makes
permanent.
as
naacp
versus
alabama
holds,
freedom
of
association
with
a
group
engaged
in
advocacy
is
a
form
of
the
freedom
of
assembly
and
is
--
is
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
since
the
membership
clause
punishes
association
with
such
a
group,
that
is
to
say
with
a
group
engaged
in
advocacy,
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
is
applicable
to
the
clause
just
as
it
is
to
any
other
restraint
from
the
exercise
for
first
amendment
right.
question
then
is,
how
shall
the
clause
--
how
shall
the
doctrine
be
applied
to
the
membership
clause?
however,
the
doctrine
is
interpreted.
it
focuses
on
the
consequences
of
the
conduct
which
is
the
object
of
the
restraint
in
question.
it
measures
the
validity
of
the
restraint
by
the
nature
of
the
danger
of
any,
which
may
be
anticipated
from
the
conduct
sought
to
be
restrained.
the
conduct
which
the
membership
clause
would
restrain
by
punishing
it
in
the
present
case
is
noto's
membership
in
the
communist
party.
the
issue
under
the
clear
and
present
dangen
--
danger
doctrine
therefore
is
not
as
to
the
danger
from
the
advocacy
of
the
communist
party.
that
danger
would
be
relevant
only
under
a
statute
punishing
advocacy.
the
issue
here
is
as
to
the
danger
from
noto's
membership
in
the
organization.
in
that
connection,
although
de
jonge
versus
oregon
was
not
decided
in
terms
to
clear
and
present
danger,
i
submit
that
it's
decisive
of
the
question.
statute
in
de
jonge
punished
association
with
an
organization
engaged
in
seditious
advocacy
by
making
it
a
crime
to
assist
in
the
conduct
of
a
meeting
of
the
organization.
as
construed
by
the
state
court,
the
statute
makes
such
assistance,
criminal,
notwithstanding
that
the
meeting
was
lawful
and
peaceable.
the
court
invalidated
the
statute
has
so
construed
to
tell
that
participation
in
a
lawful,
peaceful
meeting
may
not
be
punished
regardless
of
the
fact
that
the
sponsor
of
the
meeting
is
engaged
in
a
legal
advocacy
which
can
be
function.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
your
honor.
that's
perfectly
correct.
the
clerk
in
the
onset
and
i
quote,
"these,
referring
to
first
amendment
rights
may
be
abused
by
using
speech
or
press
or
assembly
in
order
to
incite
the
violence
or
crime,"
but
immediately
thereafter,
mr.
justice
--
the
chief
justice
hughes
added."
a
legislative
intervention
can
find
constitutional
justification
only
by
dealing
with
the
abused.
the
rights
themselves
must
not
be
curtailed.
thus,
the
constitutional
question
which
de
jonge
presented
was
not
whether
the
advocacy
of
the
communist
party
was
an
abuse.
that
is
whether
it
created
a
danger
to
the
government.
the
only
relevant
question
was
whether
the
act
which
statute
punishment,
association
with
the
party
in
the
conduct
of
its
meeting
was
an
abuse.
that
is
to
say
was
self-dangerous.
and
so
here
under
the
membership
clause,
the
issue
was
not
as
to
the
danger
from
the
advocacy
of
the
communist
party.
well,
that
danger
is
taken
care
of
by
punishing
such
advocacy
under
other
provisions
of
the
smith
act.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
membership
of
the
accused
in
the
organization
is
itself
creative
of
the
danger.
since
this
is
the
issue,
the
membership
clause
is
plainly
unconstitutional
on
its
basis.
whereas
the
government
itself
concedes,
the
membership
of
a
single
individual
cannot,
under
any
conceivable
circumstances,
create
a
clear
and
present
danger
of
the
evil
to
which
the
smith
act
would
address
and
attempt
at
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
the
government
contends
in
its
brief,
brief
in
noto
on
re-argument
--
in
the
scales
rather
on
reargument
that
it
is
not
the
membership
of
the
accused
individual
alone
but
the
aggregate
effect
of
the
membership
of
all
persons
in
the
group,
it
must
be
looked
to
in
determining
whether
a
clear
and
present
danger
exists.
de
jonge
disposes
of
this
contention
also.
the
accused
in
that
case,
de
jonge,
gave
assistance
and
support
to
the
communist
party
by
assisting
in
the
conduct
of
its
meetings.
but
great
many
other
people
did
likewise,
the
total
effect
of
their
actions
would
be
materially
to
enhance
the
influence
and
prestige
of
the
party.
but
the
court
did
not
test
the
validity
of
the
statute
by
measuring
the
aggregate
contribution
to
the
party's
unlawful
objective
which
might
be
made
by
all
the
persons
who
did
or
would
assist
in
the
conduct
of
its
meeting.
instead,
the
court
asked
too
much
more
simple
questions.
it
asked
whether
performance
by
de
jonge
himself
of
the
act
which
the
statute
punished,
was
an
abuse
of
his
first
amendment
rights.
that
is
to
say
whether
it
his
assistance,
the
conduct
of
a
lawful
meeting
endangered
organized
government.
same
inquiry
must
be
made
here,
does
the
only
act
which
the
statute
makes
an
offence
in
which
the
indictment
charges,
the
accused
membership
in
the
organization.
does
that
create
a
danger
to
organize
government?
the
answer
here
must
be
the
same
as
the
answer
of
de
jonge.
the
answer
is
fatal,
i
submit
to
the
statute.
in
arguing
the
constitutional
question,
the
government
also
contends
in
its
brief
that
the
membership
clause
is
essentially
a
conspiracy
statute
similar
to
the
one
upheld
in
the
dennis
case.
but
in
arguing
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
government
says
that
in
a
membership
case,
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
and
i
quote
"that
the
defendant
personally
conspired
to
engage
in
a
forbidden
advocacy".
it
is
indeed
a
strange
kind
of
conspiracy
statute
that
authorizes
a
conviction
for
conspiracy
without
proof
that
the
accused
conspired.
certainly,
the
statute,
as
written,
requires
no
such
proof
or
it
authorizes
a
conviction
notwithstanding
that
the
accused
disagrees
with
the
advocacy
of
forcible
overthrow,
does
not
intend
by
his
membership
to
bring
about
forcible
overthrow
and
engages
in
no
membership
activity
of
any
kind.
the
additional
agree
--
ingredients
of
intent
and
activity
which
as
mr.
davis
argued
so
forcibly
this
morning
in
the
constitutionally
protected
activity
which
the
government
proposes
to
supply
in
this
case,
too
little
to
improve
the
resemblance
of
the
statutes
of
conspiracy
law.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
does
not
content
by
his
membership
to
bring
about
the
violent
overthrow.
i've
analyzed
these
ingredients
of
intent
and
activity
in
my
brief,
the
reply
brief,
and
have
shown
that
they
can't
possibly
substitute
for
what
is
the
gist
of
the
offensive
conspiracy
and
his
participation
in
an
agreement
to
violate
the
law.
but
even
assuming
that
evidence
of
the
accused
intent
and
activity,
as
the
government
defines
and
now
today
as
we
define
them,
the
probative
of
his
participation
in
an
illegal
agreement,
the
membership
clause
could
still
not
be
sustained
as
a
conspiracy
law.
or
in
every
conspiracy
case,
the
issues
as
to
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
and
the
membership
of
the
accused
in
it
are
and
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury,
and
this
is
so
no
matter
how
compelling
the
evidence
in
the
particular
case
may
be.
in
a
prosecution
under
the
membership
clause,
however,
no
such
questions
are
given
to
the
jury,
even
as
the
government
rewrites
statute.
the
jury
gets
no
more
than
the
questions
of
knowledge,
intent
and
activity
and
membership.
thus,
the
government's
argument
must
come
down
to
the
proposition
that
jury
finding
is
against
an
accused
on
these
four
matters,
membership,
knowledge,
intent
and
activity,
raises
a
conclusive
presumption
that
he
was
a
party
to
an
agreement
to
advocate
proscribed
doctrine.
but
as
holt
versus
united
states
and
a
long
line
of
cases
holds,
the
congress
may
not
legislate
such
presumptions.
certainly
therefore,
the
court
may
not
supply
such
presumptions
by
judicial
construction
of
statutes.
the
fact
is
that
the
government
is
trying
to
do
two
things
in
this
case.
on
the
one
hand,
it
hopes
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause
on
conspiracy
for
instance.
on
the
other
hand,
it
wants
to
avoid
the
embarrassing
necessity
of
proving
a
conspiracy
in
prosecutions
under
the
smith
act.
these
two
objectives,
unfortunately
for
the
government,
are
obviously
irreconcilable.
laborious
effort
to
reconcile
them,
simply
emphasizes
the
fact
that
the
membership
clause
is
unconstitutional
because
it
violates
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine
and
then
imputes
guilt
solely
from
innocent
association.
to
conclude,
i
believe
that
dennis
versus
united
states
was
wrongly
decided
and
i
share
the
hope
expressed
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case.
but
whatever
else
dennis
may
stand
for,
it
does
not
and
cannot
support
the
constitutionality
of
the
membership
clause.
for
all
of
the
majority
opinions
in
that
case,
emphasize
that
it
was
the
presence
of
an
active
conspiracy
that
created
the
danger
and
chief
justice
vinson
stressed
that
it
was
the
nature
of
the
defendant's
activities
and
their
power
to
bring
about
the
evil
that
brought
them
outside
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
under
the
membership
clause
in
contrast,
an
accused
may
be
convicted
without
proof
that
he
conspired,
and
although
he
has
engaged
in
nothing
but
peaceable
activity
and
is
absolutely
powerless
to
bring
about
the
evil.
for
these
reasons,
i
submit,
membership
clause
is
sufficiently
in
conflict
with
the
first
amendment.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
abt
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
first
like
to
say
a
little
something
more
about
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
here.
mr.
maroney
under
questioning
by
the
chief
justice
was
unable
to
point
to
a
single
statement
by
noto
or
by
any
party
members
during
the
entire
20-year
period
covered
by
the
evidence,
which
on
its
face
constituted
an
incitement
to
violent
overthrow.
mr.
john
j.
abt
you're
honor,
that
kind
of
a
statement
about
the
newspaperman
was
a
violation
of
the
smith
act
or
criminal
intent.
i'm
just
afraid
that
the
--
it
had
prosecutions
of
several
recent
documents
of
the
whitehouse
and
would
be
indeed
very
difficult
to
get
a
form
in
either
house
(inaudible)
mr.
john
j.
abt
at
most,
your
honor,
this
was
the
statement
of
a
desire
violently
to
overthrow
an
individual,
not
--
not
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
abt
he
said
he'd
like
to
line
them
up
against
the
wall
and
shoot
so
and
so.
that
--
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
overthrowing
the
government
of
united
states.
he
says,
i
--
the
worst
you
can
say
about
it
is,
he
is
saying,
i
hope
the
day
will
come
when
we'll
have
socialism
in
this
country,
the
fellows
on
our
side
will
be
in
power
and
we
can
line
up
--
line
the
guy
like
(inaudible)
against
the
wall
and
shoot
him.
it's
not
a
very
nice
thing
to
say,
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
overthrowing
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
because
as
far
as
that
statement
is
concerned,
the
transition
to
the
kind
of
government
that
noto
liked
could
--
could
come
about
in
a
perfectly
peaceful
manner.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
in
addition
to
that
your
honor,
that's
all
you
--
all
that
can
be
dredged
up
in
this
record.
there
certainly
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
of
what
your
honors
said
in
the
yates
--
the
smith
act
(inaudible)
and
that
systematic
teaching
of
incitement
of
violence.
if
that's
all,
assuming
that
the
--
the
jury
could
considers
that
question,
if
that's
all
there
is
in
20
years,
no
--
no
jury
could
reasonably
find
a
systematic
incitement
of
violence
on
that
one
episode.
mr.
john
j.
abt
noto
made
it,
i
think
--
i'm
not
sure
your
honor
when
1948
or
1946,
something.
mr.
john
j.
abt
he
was
employed
by
a
(inaudible)
newspaperman
who
has
been
writing
half
the
stories
published
by
communist
party.
mr.
john
j.
abt
was
before
the
limitation.
mr.
john
j.
abt
page
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
do
you
have
it
with
you,
your
honor?
mr.
john
j.
abt
may
--
may
i
go
on?
mr.
maroney
says
in
his
argument
that
the
yates
standard
was
met,
not
by
the
content
of
anything
that
they
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
abt
11.
mr.
john
j.
abt
mr.
maroney
says
that
the
yates
standard
was
met
not
by
what
was
said
either
by
party
members
or
by
the
petitioner
here,
but
by
the
evidence
on
the
party's
concentration
policy
and
the
evidence
as
to
the
elaborate
measures
of
concealment
which
were
taken
to
protect
party
leaders
and
members.
it
shows
inference
of
the
purpose
of
these
activities
was
to
prepare
for
the
day
at
some
uncertain
future
time
when
conditions
with
the
auspicious
for
an
attempt
of
that
forcible
overthrow.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
these
inferences
are,
to
say
the
least
very
farfetched.
but
even
if
they're
reasonable,
they
don't
help
the
government's
case
because
mr.
maroney's
error
is
that
he
confuses
steps
in
preparation
of
insurrection
of
some
future
time
with
present
incitement
to
forcible
overthrow
in
some
future
time.
the
yates
case
rejected
evidence
of
precisely
the
kind
that
mr.
maroney
relied
--
relies
on.
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
his
opinion
in
that
case,
however
much
one
may
abhor
even
the
abstract
teaching
of
forcible
overthrow
the
government
or
believed
that
forcible
overthrow
was
the
ultimate
purpose
to
which
the
communist
party
is
dedicated.
it
is
upon
the
evidence
in
this
record
and
i
assume
that
that
means
the
evidence
in
this
record
on
the
question
of
incitement
that
the
petitioners
must
be
judged
in
this
case.
and
chief
judge
clark
in
the
second
circuit
disposed
of
the
government's
contention
in
the
united
states
versus
silverman
where
he
said
and
i
quote
him,
"the
prosecution
stresses
the
proof
of
industrial
concentration
and
of
concealment."
but
these
do
not
rationally
raise
any
inference
of
the
appellants
engaged
in
a
plot
to
advocate
insurrection
at
the
time
they
were
hiding
and
seeking
factory
jobs.
the
industrial
concentration
possibly
suggest
the
conspiracy
to
commit
sabotage,
espionage
or
political
strikes
going
beyond
mere
labor
proselytizing.
but
it
not
--
does
not
point
very
directly
toward
illegal
exhortation.
similarly,
concealment
is
consistent
with
any
unpopular
or
illegal
enterprise,
but
the
jury
could
not
tell
the
nature
of
the
enterprise
from
the
mere
fact
of
concealment.
furthermore,
mr.
maroney
did
not
and
cannot
point
to
any
evidence
of
the
advocacy
of
forcible
overthrow
even
as
a
matter
of
abstract
doctrine
in
the
limitation
period.
and
he
has
no
reply
to
my
demonstration
that
he
can't
convict
the
petitioner
on
the
theory
of
a
presumption
of
continuance.
now,
not
only
is
there
is
no
evidence
of
party
activity
in
the
limitations
period,
but
there's
no
evidence
of
any
significant
conduct
by
the
defendant.
my
brief
at
page
65
--
66,
i
summed
up
everything
in
this
record
with
respect
to
the
activity
of
the
respondent
during
the
limitations
period
and
here
it
is.
in
september
1951,
he
solicited
a
$10
contribution
to
the
party
and
talked
about
the
american
labor
camp
party
candidates
with
one
witness.
in
the
same
month,
he
told
another
witness
he
was
going
under
a
disguise
to
conceal
himself.
months
later,
he
picked
up
some
party
publications
which
is
--
his
wife
had
left
for
him
at
the
home
of
a
witness
and
told
this
man
that
he
had
to
move
on.
and
in
1953
or
1955,
he
lived
in
new
jersey
where
he
was
employed
by
the
goodyear
rubber
company
as
a
stock
clerk
under
an
assumed
name.
now,
how
can
any
of
that
evidence
be
probative?
number
one,
that
the
petitioner
knew
that
the
communist
party
was
engaged
in
incitements
to
violence
or
second
that
he
intended
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
i
say
that
obviously
it
can't
to
prove
either
of
those
propositions.
and
certainly,
none
of
the
evidence
in
this
record,
either
about
the
petitioner
or
about
the
communist
party
within
the
limitations
period
can
conceivably
establish
to
anything
they
were
doing
in
this
period
created
a
danger
even
remotely
to
the
government,
let
alone
a
clear
and
present
danger.
now,
i
also
want
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
--
in
turning
the
--
the
testimony
about
the
man
who
was
said
to
be
on
the
lamb.
that
incident
was
supposed
to
have
occurred
in
the
early
spring
of
1951
and
it
likewise
therefore
is
outside
of
the
statutory
period.
all
we
know
about
that
incident
is
the
following,
page
299
of
the
record.
that
noto
said
one
of
our
top
peoples
on
the
lamb.
he
said
the
government
is
trying
to
frame
this
man
and
throw
him
in
jail.
he
said
it
was
over
what
the
newspapers
call
was
adam's
spy
business.
he
said
it
was
necessary
to
get
this
man
out
of
the
country
in
order
to
get
him
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
law.
and
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
were
to
give
him
shelter
in
my
home.
but
the
man
never
showed
up.
nothing
other
--
ever
further
happened
about
the
whole
business.
there's
nothing
here
to
indicate
that
this
man,
whoever
he
was
--
and
by
the
way
there's
not
the
slightest
suggestion
in
the
record
that
he
was
either
rosenberg
or
in
any
way
connected
with
rosenberg.
there's
nothing
to
show
that
whoever
he
was,
he
was
engaged
in
any
criminal
activity
at
all.
at
best,
they
mostly
have
is
noto's
statement
that
the
government
was
trying
to
frame
him.
he
may
have
been
a
perfectly
innocent
man.
even
if
he
wasn't,
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
stewart
in
response
to
a
question
yesterday,
the
whole
incident
might
have
some
conceivable
relevance
to
a
prosecution
for
harboring
or
some
crime
of
that
kind
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
incitement.
now,
just
a
word
about
the
constitutional
issues.
mr.
davis
said
dennis
found
a
clear
and
present
danger
in
the
provisions
denouncing
conspiracy
to
organize
and
advocate
and
that
takes
care
of
all
the
crimes
under
the
smith
act.
but
that
obviously
is
not
true
and
yates
itself
demonstrates
that
that
is
not
true.
yates
said
that
we
construe
the
conspiracy
to
advocate
provisions
of
the
smith
act
as
requiring
proof
of
a
conspiracy
to
engage
in
incitement
now
for
future
violent
overthrow.
we
don't
have
some
of
the
questions
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
conspiracy
to
engage
in
incitement
at
some
time
in
the
future.
and
we
don't
do
it
because
a
conspiracy
to
engage
in
incitement
at
some
time
in
the
future
is
one
further
removed
from
the
advocacy
itself.
now,
dennis
have
decided
all
clear
and
present
danger
questions
under
all
offenses
created
by
the
smith
act,
but
obviously
there
would
have
been
no
necessity
for
that
reservation.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
membership
clause,
even
with
all
the
garnishments
that
the
government
gives
it,
is
one
step
further
removed
either
--
even
from
conspiracy
to
advocate
incitement
in
terms
of
the
incitement
in
the
future.
obviously,
therefore
you've
got
to
consider
whether
the
membership
clause
itself
satisfies
the
clear
and
present
danger
doctrine.
mr.
davis
says,
"well,
it's
just
like
a
conspiracy."
i
tried
to
analyze
the
act
--
the
statute
yesterday
and
to
show
that
it
didn't
bear
any
resemblance
to
that
period.
all
i
want
to
say
at
this
point
is
that
it
denies
the
defendant
whatever
is
entitled
to
in
a
conspiracy
case.
and
that
is
a
jury
trial
on
the
essential
issues
in
a
conspiracy
case.
was
there
a
conspiracy?
was
the
petitioner
for
the
accused
a
participant
in
the
conspiracy?
did
he
perform
some
overt
act
in
furtherance
of
a
conspiracy?
and
in
addition,
in
a
conspiracy
case,
an
accused
is
entitled
to
instructions
as
to
the
character
of
the
evidence
which
would
be
introduced
against
third
party
declarations.
here,
as
i
show
in
my
brief
and
i
haven't
argued
it
here,
time
didn't
permit.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
on
third
party
declarations
of
--
which
were
completely
outside
of
his
knowledge.
he
knew
nothing
about
and
he
didn't
get
the
benefit
of
a
conspiracy
instruction
that
he
would
have
had
in
a
conspiracy
case,
to
the
effect
that
those
declarations
couldn't
be
used
against
him
unless
a
jury
first
found
that
there
was
a
conspiracy,
that
he
was
member
of
it,
then
the
declarations
and
that
the
--
the
client
was
also
a
member
and
that
the
declarations
were
made
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
and
all
this
proves
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
yesterday.
what
the
government
is
asking
for
here
is,
is
to
validate
this
statute
as
a
conspiracy
law.
as
i
say
employed
the
--
the
difficulties
that
they
found
in
securing
convictions
in
the
smith
act
conspiracy
cases.
thank
you.
