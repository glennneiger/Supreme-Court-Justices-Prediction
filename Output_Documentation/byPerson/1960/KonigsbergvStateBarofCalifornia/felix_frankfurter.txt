justice

does
that
apply
everything
you've
said
not
right
to
the
specific
question
whether
you
are
a
member
of
the
party
since
1951?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
this
--
what
you've
just
argued
applied
to
his
refusal
to
answer
assuming
it's
an
allowable
question,
the
question
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
since
1951.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
you
say
that
was
dealt
with
and
that
was
no
frustrations
unless
you
can
say
putting
to
one
side
of
the
--
the
impermissibility
of
the
question?
how
can
you
say
that
that
would
invoke
a
line
of
inquiry,
a
trail
of
inquiry
that
theretofore
that
have
not
been
searched
and
which
may
invalidate
some
of
the
evidences,
the
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
a
whole
crowd
--
a
whole
cloud
of
witnesses
testifying
to
his
good
character?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
put
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
put
that
to
one
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
those
terms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
what
--
they
weren't
answered.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
issues
that
were
decided
weren't
that
specific
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
not
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
the
preface,
the
issue,
the
basis
on
which
reversal
was
sought
in.
reversal
was
sought
here
i
think
yourself
stated
on
two
grounds.
one,
if
you're
a
man
of
moral
character
and
two,
if
he
engaged
in
or
entertain
beliefs
or
practice
(inaudible)
of
force
and
violence.
but
the
specific
question,
which
if
answered
one
way,
it
leads
to
further
inquiry,
was
not
in
that
case,
adjudicated
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
the
whole
question
when
you
said
based
upon
it.
based
upon
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
he
refused
to
answer
that
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
tell
an
experienced
lawyer
like
you
that
question
sometimes
reflect
different
significances
as
to
the
uses
made
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
but
that
judgment,
that
view
of
mr.
justice
traynor
for
whom
i
have
a
greatest
respect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
reference
to
different
legal
question
and
no
one
will
now
represent
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
deciding
this
according
--
he
didn't
go
on
to
constitutional
ground,
did
he?
he
went
on
the
ground
in
his
capacity
as
a
reviewing
authority
of
what
the
committee
found.
he
could
well
find
that
on
this
situation,
you
should
not
have
ruled
against
this
applicant
for
admission
at
the
very
different
question,
then
the
question
you
are
now
arguing,
to
which
you're
now
addressing
yourself
namely
whether
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
refusal
to
answer,
excluded
the
committee
from
inquiring
into
a
line
of
relevant
considerations
that
might,
on
one
--
on
one
basis,
lead
them
to
justify
but
rejected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
justice
traynor
is
the
last
man
in
the
world,
not
just
knowing
the
difference
between
the
grounds
on
which
he
went,
in
the
ground
on
which
his
dissenting
colleague
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
first
amendment
isn't
restricted
to
what
might
be
called
political
view,
social
view,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
be
--
could
he
be
asked
a
lot
of
questions
as
to
the
function
and
belief
in
the
state
organized
bar
that
he'd
be
asked
questions
as
to
belief
in
contingencies
but
he
ask
--
he
asks
questions
as
to
the
requirement,
constitutionality
to
determine
as
--
under
the
ohio
constitution
by
all
except
one
member
of
the
court?
could
he
be
asked
any
of
those
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
kind
of
questions
that
are
asked?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
you
know
that?
could
he
be
asked
questions
if
he
beliefs
in
an
elective
or
against
the
party
of
judiciary?
could
he
asked
--
asked
questions
about
the
tenure?
could
he
be
asked
--
could
he
even
be
asked
questions
as
to
what
he
thought
about
some
--
on
the
merits
of
some
recent
decisions
of
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
might
disclose
such
--
such
--
what
shall
i
say
(inaudible)
knowledge
of
the
law
that
they
might
(inaudible)
a
man
who
has
--
who
object
to
a
decision
on
this
ground
rather
than
that
really
isn't
such
a
practice.
no
matter
what
kind
of
questions,
he
answered
them
in
the
examination
papers
were
result
of
a
cram
course
on
the
basis
of
which
so
many
bar
examinations
are
being
taken
these
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
now
suggesting
that
the
california
supreme
court
would
deny
an
admission
nearly
because
he
was
--
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
of
the
years
ago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
then
they're
on
a
par.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
guess
here
as
to
what
is
likely
to
give
you
effect
of
his
answers
in
the
eyes
of
the
existing
supreme
court
of
california
to
vote
as
it
is,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you
indicated
that
--
that
he
wouldn't
be
denied
admission
by
the
california
supreme
court
as
he
gave
answers
to
some
of
the
questions
that
i
hypothesize.
therefore,
we
must
seat
here
and
decide
what
kind
of
a
--
what
--
what
the
attitude
now
(inaudible)
of
the
supreme
court
of
california,
of
utah,
north
dakota
and
massachusetts
etcetera
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
(inaudible)
to
give
an
extreme
case,
suppose
the
state
said
we
--
whether
on
the
ground
that
he
refused
to
answer
questions
and
the
total
--
no
question
about
the
record
being
a
full
record,
and
i'm
reading
it,
one
finds
that
he
did
not
refuse
to
answer
any
question.
i
suppose
that
--
that'd
be
little
doubt
that
--
that
what
the
state
says
was
a
state
ground,
isn't
a
state
ground
in
that
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
we
have
a
clear
case.
but
if
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
were
refusals
to
answer
questions
and
the
state
said,
"because
he
refused
to
answer
those
questions
which
we
think
were
proper
questions
to
the
court,
could
we
then
reject
that
ground?
we
might
--
we
might
bring
into
question
or
counsel,
they'll
bring
into
question
the
--
the
constitutional
validity
of
refusing
to
answer?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
the
state
would
--
court
went
on
that
ground,
hardly
a
subject
to
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
do
that,
but
if
a
door
no
matter
how
small
is
a
sufficient
aptitude
to
which
a
person
can
pass
then
the
state
can
select
that
small
door,
can't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
with
this
case,
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
--
if
that
door
wasn't
vaulted
by
this
court,
i
understand
you
ought
to
say
it
was.
that's
a
different
question
and
therefore,
there
was
a
disobedience
of
the
mandate
of
this
court,
i
understand
that.
but
if
we
go
beyond
that
and
say
it
wasn't
vaulted,
if
there
is
a
rule
no
matter
how
small
it
is,
how
small
or
narrow
a
door,
which
was
not
voted
by
this
court,
then
the
state
court
can
go
through
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
it
--
it
can't
--
the
generality
is
it
can't
evade
the
protection
of
a
constitutional
right
which
this
court
sets
to
protect,
by
pretending
by
an
evasive
use
of
state
law
but
you
got
to
get
ultimately
to
that
position.
