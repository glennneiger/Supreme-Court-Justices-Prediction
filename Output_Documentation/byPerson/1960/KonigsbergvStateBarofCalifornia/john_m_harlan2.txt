justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
not
true
that
the
majority
of
your
court
has
held
in
this
case
that
refusal
to
answer
relevant
pertinent
questions
is
a
ground
for
denial
in
the
california
(inaudible)
admission
to
the
bar?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
said
it.
i
mean
it's
not
nearly
in
effect.
that's
the
basis
of
its
holding,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
it's
held.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
holding
is
one
that
binds
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
holding
on
state
law
is
one
which
we
have
to
accept,
the
california
courts'
view
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
the
rules
that
governed
and
after
admissions
to
the
bar
must
be
those
that
are
in
effect
at
the
time
he
completes
his
laws
to
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
no
doubt
that
if
he
went
back
to
the
committee
and
answered
the
question
that
he's
refused
to
answer,
he'd
be
admitted,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
a
lawyer
has
a
less
duty
of
candor
to
the
admitting
authorities
or
ultimately
to
the
court
in
an
ordinary
layman
has
to
his
employer?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
this
record
contained
all
of
the
supplemental
questions
other
than
the
ones
that
were
in
the
record
in
the
last
case?
