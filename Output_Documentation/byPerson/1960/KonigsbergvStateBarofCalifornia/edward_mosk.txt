mr.
edward
mosk
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices.
we've
had
a
somewhat
unusual,
i
think,
for
the
court
situation
this
afternoon
in
a
situation
of
a
petitioner
speaking
for
himself.
i
think
perhaps
in
the
konigsberg
case,
we
come
in
to
a
second
somewhat
unusual
situation
in
that
we
have
a
case
here
for
the
second
time
on
at
least
what
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
petitioner
would
seem
to
us
to
be
almost
identical
facts
as
have
already
been
determined
by
this
court.
i,
of
course,
am
well
aware
of
the
theory
under
which
the
state
of
california
acting
through
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
has
brought
this
case
before
you
a
second
time
by
declining
to
admit
the
petitioner
after
the
decision
of
this
court.
so
that
i
think
that
i
should
commence
by
reviewing
the
facts
as
they
have
occurred,
bringing
us
down
first
to
the
present
moment
of
this
second
konigsberg
case.
the
court
will
remember
that
on
may
6th,
1957,
this
court
said
about
the
petitioner
without
some
authentic
reliable
evidence
of
unlawful
or
immoral
actions
reflecting
upon
him,
it
is
difficult
to
comprehend
why
the
state
rejected
a
man
of
konigsberg's
background
and
character
as
morally
unfit
to
practice
law.
now,
in
california,
there
are
two
statutes
which
come
in
to
play
in
connection
with
admissions
of
--
of
perspective
applicants
for
the
bar.
we
have
the
business
and
professions
called
section
6060
which
simply,
along
with
age
and
education
requirements,
establishes
that
a
person
must
be
of
good
moral
character.
and
then
we
have
section
6064.1
which
says
that
no
person
who
advocates
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence
maybe
a
member
of
the
bar.
now,
as
far
as
petitioner
is
concern,
these
are
the
only
two
statutes
that
are
really
involved
in
this
case
at
the
present
time.
konigsberg
comments
the
study
of
law
in
september
of
1950
at
the
university
of
southern
california.
he
registered
his
intention
to
take
the
bar
examination
with
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
in
accordance
with
the
normal
procedures
in
december
of
1950.
his
previous
background
was
somewhat
unusual
for
a
law
student
in
that
he
was
already
39
years
old
had
already
had
a
distinguished
career
in
social
work
in
the
community
of
los
angeles
and
other
parts
of
the
country.
he
had
a
master's
degree
at
ohio
state
university.
he
had,
at
one
time,
been
a
supervisor
in
the
department
of
health
here
in
the
district
of
columbia.
he
had
been
director
of
social
services
for
the
city
of
hope
sanatorium
in
los
angeles.
he
had
been
a
district
director
of
relief
in
the
state
of
california.
during
the
war,
he
had
spent
some
four
years
in
the
army
and
had
come
out
with
the
rank
of
captain
in
the
united
states
army.
nevertheless,
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
take
the
bar
examination,
he
was
called
in
by
the
committee
bar
examiners,
which
in
california,
under
our
integrated
bar
system,
differing
in
that
extent
from
illinois,
has
the
power
to
recommend
to
the
supreme
court
but
in
california,
the
supreme
court
does
the
admitting
of
respective
app
--
applicants
for
the
bar.
he
was
called
then
and
certain
hearings
were
conducted
of
which
the
record
was
before
this
court
in
its
entirety
in
the
case
which
was
decided
in
1957.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearings
in
1953
and
1954,
the
supreme
court
of
california
declined
to
review
a
determination
by
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
that
the
petitioner
had
not
met
his
burden
of
proof
that
he
was
a
person
of
good
moral
character
or
that
he
did
not
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
petition
for
review
was
made
to
the
supreme
court
of
california.
and
although
three
of
the
judges
voted
for
a
hearing,
no
hearing
was
held
in
the
supreme
court
of
california
and
the
matter
came
to
this
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari.
the
decision
of
this
court,
of
course,
is
353
u.s.
252,
the
case
of
konigsberg
versus
state
bar.
now,
after
the
mandate
from
this
court
came
down
to
california,
the
petitioner,
acting
through
counsel,
requested
the
supreme
court
of
california,
which
was
not
then
in
session,
to
set
a
time
for
hearing
for
the
petitioner
to
be
sworn
in
as
a
member
of
the
bar
assuming
that
the
--
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
instructing
the
state
of
california
to
take
action
not
inconsistent
with
the
decision
could
only
mean
that
petitioner
should
be
admitted
to
the
bar.
the
considerable
period
of
time
passed
in
which
the
supreme
court
of
california
did
not
act
and
then
finally,
the
supreme
court
vacated
its
previous
orders
in
the
matter
and
sent
the
matter
to
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
with
instructions
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
should
take
action
not
inconsistent
with
the
supreme
court
decision.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
then
requested
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
of
the
state
of
california
that
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
simply
make
a
recommendation
that
petitioner
be
admitted
to
the
bar
of
the
state
of
california.
instead,
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
called
further
hearings
and
the
record,
which
is
before
this
court
in
the
present
proceeding,
consists
of
the
hearing
before
the
committee
of
bar
examiners.
now,
when
the
hearing
was
held,
petitioner
again
initially
said,
"there
is
no
point
to
this
hearing.
we
have
established
the
basic
qualifications
for
admission
to
the
bar
in
california.
and
we
believe
that
the
only
action
inconsistent
with
the
court
decision
is
an
order
admitting
--
certifying
me
to
admission
to
the
bar."
the
committee
turned
down
this
motion
and
then
asked
petitioner
whether
he
was
prepared
to
answer
other
questions
and
petitioner
indicated
that
he
was.
the
petitioner,
at
the
subsequent
hearing,
introduced
additional
letters,
some
14
or
15,
now
making
a
total
of
about
55
communications
from
persons
in
all
walks
of
life
in
the
los
angeles
community
and
elsewhere
in
the
country,
attesting
to
his
good
moral
character
and
for
the
most
part
of
testing
to
the
fact
that
--
to
the
knowledge
of
the
persons
writing
the
letters
that
he
did
not
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government.
but
at
the
first
hearings
and
before
this
court,
in
the
briefs
of
the
state
bar,
there
had
been
some
comments
to
the
fact
that
these
letters
really
were
not
of
great
significance
because
they
were
in
written
form
and
there
was
no
opportunity
to
cross-examine.
and
so
at
this
hearing,
the
petitioner
added
to
the
strength
of
this
record.
he
offered
the
persons
who
had
written
the
letters
to
be
available
for
cross-examination
but
in
addition
to
that,
he
brought
his
employer
for
the
previous
two
and
a
half
years
as
one
live
witness
ready
to
testify
before
the
committee
and
submitting
himself
to
the
cross-examination
of
the
committee
if
they
so
wished
as
to
petitioner's
good
moral
character.
the
witness
testified
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
testimony,
the
committee
was
asked
whether
they
have
any
questions
in
cross-examination
and
they
indicated
they
had
none.
now,
what
did
the
committee
do
at
this
hearing?
the
committee
introduced
not
one
single
bit
of
evidence
to
contradict
the
good
moral
character
already
established
to
the
petitioner.
they
introduced
no
evidence
of
any
kind
regarding
advocacy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
introduced
no
evidence,
period.
the
committee
admitted
that
subsequent
to
the
decision
of
this
court,
the
committee
had
had
an
investigator
who
investigated
into
the
background
of
the
petitioner
and
stated
specifically
that
if
they
had
any
information
contrary
to
good
moral
character
or
indicating
advocacy
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
that
they
would
bring
this
information
forward
and
allow
petitioner
to
rebut
it
before
it
would
be
used
in
any
manner
against
him.
this
is
never
been
done.
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
the
investigator
found
nothing
wrong
in
the
background
or
life
of
the
petitioner.
in
addition,
the
committee
failed
to
cross-examine.
and
the
only
change,
the
only
change
in
the
record
so
far
is
the
committee
is
concern
from
that
which
was
before
this
court
at
the
time
of
the
prior
decision
was
that
the
committee
asked
again
the
same
questions
which
it
had
asked
in
the
record
before
this
court
in
1957.
they
again
asked
the
petitioner
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
and
this
time,
they
changed
the
record
only
to
the
extent
that
they
did
give
him
a
verbal,
across
the
table
warning
in
the
sense
that
they
said,
"if
you
do
not
answer
this
question,
it
will
prevent
us
from
further
investigating
and
therefore,
it
may
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
certify
you."
now,
other
than
that,
there
is
not
one
single
change
in
the
record
that
was
before
this
court
in
the
--
prior
to
the
decision
in
1957
and
the
record
that
is
before
this
court
today.
now,
petitioner
pointed
out
at
this
hearing
that
the
principal
reasons
which
he
had
given
before
for
not
answering
the
question
still
prevail
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
felt
that
he
--
there
was
certain
basis
for
a
reinforcement
of
his
principal
position
by
reason
of
the
supreme
court
decision.
and
he
took
basically
the
position
that
one
of
the
requirements
upon
him
was
that
he
be
of
good
moral
character.
if
he
had
constantly,
as
he
had,
both
before
this
court
and
before
the
committee,
taken
the
position
that
it
was
a
morally
improper
for
him
to
respond
to
these
questions,
that
the
committee
was,
in
effect,
placing
him
in
the
position
where
they
said,
"if
you
do
not
answer
the
questions,
then
we
will
not
certify
you.
but
in
effect,
if
you
do
answer
the
questions,
you
will
buy
your
own
definition
be
saying
that
you
are
an
immoral
person
because
for
purposes
of
expediency,
you
are
willing
to
answer
the
questions
which
your
moral
principles
say
you
should
not
answer."
this
was
the
dilemma
that
the
committee
was
placing
him
at.
and
of
course,
he
stood
on
the
moral
principles
and
declined
to
answer
the
specific
questions.
now,
it's
evident
that
so
far
as
the
evidence
before
this
committee
is
concerned,
any
change
in
the
posture
of
the
case
is
a
change
more
favorable
to
konigsberg
because
not
only
do
we
have
the
record
of
the
favorable
comments
of
the
people
in
his
community
that
we
had
before,
we
now
have
additional
comments.
we
have
a
live
witness
who
testified
and
gave
the
opportunity
for
cross-examination
and
we
have
the
concession
on
the
part
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
that
there
are
investigations
into
the
background
and
life
of
konigsberg
had
achieved
nothing
by
way
of
information
that
would
be
detrimental
to
his
good
moral
character.
so
that
if
the
record
of
this
case
in
1957
could
not
rationally
show
a
basis
for
refusing
to
admit
the
petitioner,
we
would
submit
that
such
a
conclusion
is
even
less
reasonable
today.
and
that
simply
based
on
this
record
and
based
on
the
decision
of
this
case,
we
would
submit
the
petitioner,
based
on
the
mandate
of
this
court,
should
have
been
admitted
and
this
court
should
make
such
an
order.
but
the
committee
seemed
to
be
of
the
belief
that
in
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1957,
there
was
some
sort
of
an
open
door
through
which
they
could
walk
and
find
a
means
that
this
court
was
--
was
giving
them
a
basis
by
which
they
could
deny
konigsberg
admission
to
the
bar.
this
was
really
the
only
conclusion
that
one
can
draw
from
the
manner
of
procedure
by
which
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
followed
up
the
decision
of
this
court.
i
think
then
that
we
should
examine
this
open
door
type
argument
and
see
whether
there
is
any
merit
to
it.
now,
obviously,
counsel
cannot
very
well
endeavor
to
interpret
what
this
court
did
intend
by
the
decision
in
1957
other
than
by
a
reasonable
and
logical
reading
of
the
words
of
the
court.
and
therefore,
without
presuming
to
try
and
read
into
the
decision
more
than
appears
on
the
words,
i
will
endeavor
to
see
whether
this
door
really
was
intended
to
be
left
open
for
the
committee
of
bar
examiners.
first,
i
think,
we
must
consider
the
elemental
unfairness
of
the
position
taken
by
the
committee
of
bar
examiners.
we
must
remember
first
of
all,
as
i
indicated
the
beginning,
that
there
were
two
statutory
bases
in
california
under
which
petitioner
might
have
been
denied
admission
to
the
bar.
there's
no
argument
that
he
meets
all
of
the
other
requirements.
there
is
no
argument
that
he
has
passed
the
bar
examination,
that
he
is
of
proper
age.
all
of
these
requirements
have
been
clearly
met.
so
that
the
only
two
statutory
requirements
that
seemed
to
be
in
any
way
involved
in
this
case
are
the
statutory
requirements
of
good
moral
character
and
the
statutory
requirement
that
he'd
not
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government.
now,
the
evidence
relating
to
these
factors
was
all
in
the
record
of
this
court
prior
to
the
1957
decision.
and
the
court
found
contrary
to
the
position
of
the
state
of
california.
the
court
specifically
said
that
it
could
not
see
how
the
state
of
california
could've
refused
admission
to
a
person
of
konigsberg's
background
and
said
in
this
opinion
that
the
evidence
did
not
support
a
finding
that
he
was
not
of
good
moral
character
or
that
he
was
not
a
person
who
did
not
advocate
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
mr.
justice
peters,
in
his
dissent
in
the
california
supreme
court
on
this
second
konigsberg
case,
stated
the
theme,
i
think
as
clearly
as
it
--
it
can
be
stated.
mr.
justice
peters
said,
"how
many
times
does
the
issue
of
whether
an
applicant
possesses
a
good
moral
character
and
as
a
loyal
citizen
have
to
be
tried?
when
does
this
litigation
come
to
an
end?
i
had
always
though
until
i
read
the
decision
of
the
majority,"
referring
to
the
majority
to
california
court,
in
this
case,
"that
our
system
of
law
was
predicated
on
the
fundamental
theory
that
when
issues
between
litigants
have
once
been
determined,
they
cannot
be
re-litigated.
i
had
always
thought
that
litigants
were
required
to
raise
all
relevant
issues
in
one
proceeding.
i
had
assumed
the
parties
cannot
litigate
their
case
piecemeal."
and
mr.
justice
peters
concluded
and
we
believe
rightly,
although
the
majority
of
the
california
court
did
not
agree
with
him,
that
to
permit
respondent,
the
state
in
this
case,
to
lose
on
one
theory
and
approach
to
the
case
and
then
readjust
the
record
to
conform
to
some
new
theory,
picking
out
a
few
words
in
the
decision
of
the
court
on
the
very
case
is
fundamentally
unfair,
it's
arbitrary,
it's
capricious
and
it's
a
denial
of
due
process.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
what
the
state
of
california
has
done
in
this,
the
konigsberg
case.
but
let's
examine
the
language
of
the
court
in
this
konigsberg
case
and
determine
how
it
applies
to
the
facts
of
the
case
as
it
now
stand
as
the
present
posture
of
the
case.
what
did
the
court
say
that
lead
the
state
of
california
to
this
peculiar
interpretation
that
they
were
not
to
then
admit
konigsberg
to
the
bar?
the
language
which
they
seem
to
up
seized
upon
reads,
"if
and
when
a
state
makes
failure
to
answer
an
independent
--
makes
failure
to
answer
an
independent
ground
for
exclusion,
then
this
court,
as
the
cases
arise,
will
have
to
determine
whether
the
exclusion
is
constitutionally
permissible."
now,
california
somehow
seems
to
have
taken
this
statement
as
some
sort
of
a
mandate
or
a
directive
for
them
to
take
some
action
against
konigsberg.
and
i
submit
that
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
clear
import
of
these
words.
california
completely
ignored
the
words
preceding
this
in
the
decision
which
said,
"there
is
nothing
in
the
california
statutes,
the
california
decisions
or
even
in
the
rules
of
the
bar
committee
which
suggest
that
this
is
a
proper
procedure
for
them
to
take."
and
the
opinion
then
goes
on
to
point
out
that
establishing
such
a
rule
now
without
fair
warning
would
raise
questions
with
elemental
fairness.
so
california
seizes
upon
this
language
of
--
of
fair
warning
and
somehow
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
just
sitting
down
across
the
table
with
the
very
man
who
has
been
involved
in
the
lawsuit
which
has
already
been
determined
by
the
court
and
that
all
they
had
to
do
is
sit
out
across
the
table
from
him
and
give
him
a
fair
warning
now
10
years
after
he
started
the
practice
of
law
and
that
this
complied
with
the
requirements
of
due
process.
mr.
edward
mosk
this
is,
in
effect,
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
is
what
the
california
case
has
said
in
this
case
and
at
this
late
date,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
mosk
the
basis
of
what?
mr.
edward
mosk
this
is
the
holding
in
the
second
konigsberg
case.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
--
which,
of
course,
the
reason
we
are
here
is
that
we
disagree
with
that
holding
and
feel
that
that
holding
is
completely
an
error.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
holding
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
not.
and
i
--
in
--
in
a
moment,
i
--
i
will
meet
directly
to
that
point.
now,
the
state
of
california
has,
as
i
say,
seized
upon
this
warning
point
as
the
basis
upon
which
they
now
feel
that
they
have
complied
in
some
manner
with
this
court's
decision.
but
i
think
it's
important,
in
determining
the
elemental
fairness
of
what's
taken
place
here,
to
examine
the
nature
of
the
warning,
the
timing
of
the
warming
--
warning
to
see
whether
or
not
that
warning
did
in
fact
comply
with
the
requirements
of
due
process.
first
of
all,
this
warning
took
place
simply
by
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
sitting
in
this
session
stating
to
the
petitioner,
"this
is
what
we
are
saying
to
you
that
if
you
do
not
answer
the
question,
this
can
be
a
basis
for
us
refusing
to
certify."
but
we
must
remember
that
this
took
place
seven
years
after
this
petitioner
commenced
the
study
of
law.
we
must
remember
that
this
was
four
years
after
he
had
completed
his
studies
and
had
passed
the
bar
examination.
and
this
was
almost
six
months
after
this
court
had
ruled
on
the
identical
facts
relating
to
the
same
identical
person.
now,
there
was
no
statute
in
california
before
or
after
which
related
to
this
subject.
there
was
no
formal
rule
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
passed
in
accordance
with
regulations
which
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
and
the
state
of
california
had
in
effect
self-imposed
upon
them
because
we
have
in
california
a
provision
which
says
that
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
may
pass
a
rule
approved
by
the
board
of
governors
of
the
state
bar
of
california.
now,
if
the
committee
was
endeavoring
to
say
that
this
across
the
table
type
of
warning
was
some
sort
of
a
new
rule,
they
had
failed
to
comply
with
their
own
statutory
requirements.
if
it
was
anything
less
than
that,
if
it
was
not
a
rule
of
some
stature,
then
what
effect
did
it
have
upon
the
man
who
hears
this
for
the
first
time
so
many
years
after
he
has
entered
into
the
study
of
law
and
has
begun
the
entire
sequence
of
events
which
have
led
him
know
or
seven
years
later
to
this
hearing
having
spent
the
time,
the
money
to
become
a
member
of
a
profession
of
his
own
choice
and
suddenly
by
an
across
the
table
without
any
background,
without
any
warning
to
be
told,
"if
you
don't
answer
this
one
question,
this
in
and
of
itself
will
suddenly
become
a
basis
to
deny
your
admission
to
the
bar"?
now,
on
top
of
that,
there
are
several
other
factors
that
should
certainly
be
considered
in
connection
with
what
was
the
stature
of
this
kind
of
warning
that
they
were
talking
about.
this
court
decided
a
few
weeks
ago,
the
nelson
case
which
involved
a
--
also
involved
the
state
of
california.
but
in
the
nelson
case,
there
was
a
specific
statute
in
california
relating
to
the
type
of
employee
who
is
involved
in
the
nelson
case.
but
we
have
--
there
is
no
statute
and
on
the
contrary,
there
have
been
several
efforts,
as
i
indicate
in
my
briefs,
to
pass
such
statutes
in
california
justifying
the
kind
of
question
that
was
being
asked
here
and
in
every
situation,
those
statutes
were
defeated
by
the
legislative
bodies
of
the
state
of
california.
so
that
not
only
do
we
not
have
any
legislative
authority
for
the
asking
of
the
kind
of
--
of
--
across
the
table
question
that
we
have
here
but
we
have
the
direct
contrary.
we
have
a
determination
by
the
legislature
of
california
being
asked
to
pass
such
a
law
and
rejecting
such
law.
so
that
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances,
this
kind
of
across
the
table
type
of
warning
is
just
not
a
warning,
even
assuming
that
this
court
intended
to
leave
this
matter
open
for
further
action
in
the
konigsberg
case
as
such
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
warning
intended
by
this
court
and
does
not
qualify
in
any
manner
as
a
proper
warning
to
him.
now
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
saying
this,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
if
there
was
any
type
of
an
instruction
from
this
court
to
the
state
of
california,
and
i
do
not
believe
there
was,
i
believe
that,
at
most,
this
court
was
saying
that
if,
at
some
time
in
the
future,
another
case
arising
where
proper
warning
has
been
given
so
that
the
person
who
embarked
upon
the
study
of
law
knew
when
he
started
that
if
questions
were
going
to
be
asked
to
him
and
he
declined
to
answer
them
that
he
would
be
denied
admission.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
the
court
indicated
that
this
--
that
grave
constitutional
questions
would
be
raised
even
by
this.
but
i'm
saying
that
if
any
hole
was
left
in
the
decision,
what
was
being
said
to
the
state
of
california
was
either
have
a
statute
or
have
a
rule
of
some
sort
of
some
stature,
so
that
the
applicant
can
be
properly
warned
that
there
is
something
of
--
there
is
something
in
the
books
that
will
tell
him
when
he
commences
the
practice
of
law
that
this
is
a
requirement
of
him.
now,
i
say
that
in
this
case,
this
is
not
what
happened
at
all.
there
was
no
statute
before
the
first
decision.
there
is
no
statute
in
the
state
of
california
today.
there
was
no
rule
of
the
bar
examiner's
before
the
first
decision.
there
is
no
rule
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
today.
and
to
go
even
further,
the
very
rules
governing
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
in
the
state
of
california
require
that
when
they
pass
a
rule
that
that
rule
must
be
approved
by
the
board
of
bar
governors
before
it
becomes
a
formal
rule
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners.
so
i
say,
what
was
the
nature
of
this
theme
that
happened
at
a
hearing?
it
was
not
a
--
it
--
it
was
not
a
formal
warning
or
a
formal
rule
of
any
sort,
it
could
be
nothing
more
than
a
seven-year
too
late
across
the
table
comment
from
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners.
it
could
be
nothing
more
than
that
because
there
was
nothing
of
record
that
gained
statutory
authority
for
the
asking
of
this
particular
question.
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
that
i
would
go
that
far.
i
think
that
what
i
would
say
is
that
when
one
combines
all
of
the
circumstances
behind
this
particular
case
and
add
up
the
fact
that
there
was
no
rule
in
existence
when
he
commence
the
bar
and
there
was
not
even
a
rule
in
existence
when
he
came
up
to
the
point
where
he
took
the
examination
and
there
was
not
even
a
rule
in
existence
when
he
was
at
the
threshold
of
being
admitted
and
that
rule
didn't
exist
at
the
time
this
court
made
its
decision
and
the
rule
still
doesn't
exist.
i
am
simply
saying
that
when
you
add
all
of
these
factors
together
in
this
particular
record,
it
seems
to
me
that
elemental
unfairness
is
involved.
now,
whether
--
if
the
state
of
california
or
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
had
intervened
between
the
decision
of
this
court
and
the
time
they
called
him
back
and
had
passed
some
sort
of
a
formal
rule,
in
fairness,
i
would
say
that
i
think
that
i
would
be
taking
the
same
position
that
i
am
now
because
i
think
this
would
still
be
fundamentally
unfair
but
they
didn't
even
do
that.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
it.
i
don't
think
there
has
ever
been
any
doubt
about
it,
your
honor.
now,
when
--
when
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
talks
in
terms
of
a
--
of
some
sort
of
an
exclusionary
rule,
i
would
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
--
of
the
way
the
whole
history
of
the
way
this
has
happened,
they
have
fallen
far
short
of
giving
due
process
to
this
petitioner.
now,
when
i
say
that,
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
suggest,
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
i
feel
that
had
they
come
up
with
any
such
rule
that
i
would
not
be
making
the
same
--
taking
the
same
position.
i
think
the
rule
even
at
that
late
date
certainly
has
applied
to
this
petitioner
would
have
just
been
completely
unfair
and
a
denial
of
due
process.
now,
the
rationale
by
which
the
committee
perceives
from
the
asking
of
the
question
in
this
across
the
table
kind
of
questioning
to
a
determination
that
they
could
not
certify
him
for
admission
to
the
bar.
is
this
theory
that
they
developed
that
in
some
manner,
they
were
frustrated
in
their
inquiry
and
that
by
--
since
they
have
the
responsibility
to
determine
fitness
that
they
have
been
frustrated
in
the
purposes
of
their
inquiry
and
therefore,
they
could
not
certify
him.
now,
i
think
examining
this
line
of
argument,
we
have
to
examine
first
what's
being
frustrated.
how
are
they
being
frustrated
in
this
proceeding?
as
i've
indicated,
under
the
california
law,
the
only
issues
to
be
determined,
as
they
apply
to
this
case,
at
least
of
the
moral
character
and
the
question
of
advocacy
of
force
and
violence.
now,
on
both
of
these
issues,
this
court,
in
its
opinion,
made
what
amounted
to
a
finding
a
fact.
this
court
said
that
the
petitioner
had
met
his
burden
of
proof
and
it
was
inconceivable
under
these
circumstances
how
the
court
in
--
how
california
could
have
denied
him
admission.
so
that
we
have
the
somewhat
unusual
situation
applying
to
this
particular
case
which
perhaps
would
not
apply
to
some
other
case
of
what
amounted
to
a
finding
of
fact
on
the
two
key
issues
which
were
before
the
committee
and
then
ultimately
before
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
california.
now,
california
has
a
code
section
similar
to
most
states
that
once
they
--
condition
once
proved
to
exist
is
--
is
presumed
to
continue
until
the
contrary
is
proved.
the
only
change
in
the
record,
from
the
record
before
this
court
in
1957,
is
a
strengthening
of
the
arguments
in
favor
of
a
finding
a
good
moral
character,
a
further
affirmation
of
bringing
up-to-date
of
the
good
moral
character
of
the
petitioner.
the
state
of
california
now
asks
the
self
same
questions
which
it
had
asked
prior
to
the
first
decision
of
the
court.
it
leaves
the
record
in
exactly
the
same
condition
that
the
record
was
in
the
exact
same
posture
that
it
was
in
--
in
1957
and
then
somehow
suggest
that
it
has
been
frustrated.
but
if
we
dig
a
little
deeper
into
the
--
into
the
record,
i
think
that
the
--
the
whole
frustration
argument
becomes
even
more
ludicrous
based
on
the
record
before
this
court.
first
of
all,
this
is
not
a
situation
of
a
petitioner
coming
before
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
and
simply
without
any
basis
at
all
saying
i
just
--
i'm
just
not
going
to
answer
your
questions.
this
is
a
case
of
a
petitioner
who,
for
his
own
moral
principles,
has
said
there
is
an
area
in
which
i
will
not
answer
these
questions.
but
he
said,
"ask
me
any
questions
you
want
about
wrongdoing
of
any
kind,
i
will
answer
any
of
your
questions."
and
they
asked
none
and
they
presented
none.
he
said
the
question
of
advocacy
of
force
and
violence.
he
said
at
some
points
in
the
record
that
he
was
not
satisfied
as
to
even
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
but
he
was
not
challenging
that.
and
we
have
not
before
this
court
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
although
we
well
might
because
the
petitioner
did
answer
any
questions
directed
to
advocacy
of
force
and
violence.
and
he
offered
time
and
time
and
time
again
in
this
record,
"bring
forth
any
facts,
bring
forth
any
evidence,
i
will
answer
any
and
all
of
your
questions
in
this
area."
so
here
again,
he
is
not
frustrating
the
committee.
he
offered
more
than
50
character
witnesses
to
be
investigated,
to
be
checked,
to
be
brought
before
the
committee
if
they
so
wished.
they
have
the
subpoena
power.
they
could
have
called
any
one
of
these
50
witnesses
if
there
was
any
question
about
the
fact
of
his
good
moral
character.
he
brought
his
employer,
two
and
a
half
years,
who
had
every
opportunity
to
know
him,
worked
with
him
closely,
testified
that
he
gave
him
the
right
to
sign
checks
on
over
a
million
dollars
in
his
capacity
as
an
employee
and
obviously,
thereby
indicated
his
faith
and
confidence
in
the
character
of
this
man.
not
a
single
question
or
cross-examination
by
the
committee.
and
on
top
of
that,
the
committee
had
its
investigator.
now,
in
the
light
of
this
record,
one
wonders
about
the
legitimacy
of
this
claim
of
frustration.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
what
we
have
here
is
that
the
committee
is
endeavoring
to
treat
this
case
as
though
this
were
a
young
law
student
of
21
or
22
years
of
age
appearing
before
the
committee
for
the
first
time
being
asked
the
first
two
or
three
questions
and
saying,
"i
won't
answer
them,"
and
then
completely
frustrating
any
further
inquiry.
but
this
just
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
here.
and
i
think
that
this
is
perhaps
the
basic
fallacy
in
which
the
state
has
fallen
into
is
in
assuming
that
they
are
dealing
with
one
case
when
in
fact,
they
are
obviously
dealing
with
another.
so
that
we
submit
that
under
these
circumstances
and
when
we
weigh
the
need
of
the
state
for
the
kind
of
information
which
they
were
seeking
here
in
balance
with
the
otherwise
complete,
complete
granting
of
all
of
the
information
which
they
seek,
making
available
anything
that
they
want,
complete
cooperation
except
in
the
most
limited,
narrow
and
to
be
sure,
first
amendment
area.
and
when
we
balance
this
further
with
the
need
for
the
importance
of
freedom
of
the
bar,
which
i
have
indicated
in
some
detail
in
my
briefs
and
we'll
not
go
into
now
because
i'm
sure
that
every
member
of
this
court
is
as
well
aware
of
the
importance
of
freedom
of
--
an
independence
of
the
bar
as
anything
that
i
could
add
at
this
time.
when
we
weigh
all
of
these
factors
in
the
balance,
it
certainly
seems
to
me
that
we
must
--
the
scales
must
drop
very
heavily
on
the
side
of
konigsberg.
now
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
didn't
hear
the
beginning,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
say
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
if
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all
and
your
question
has
excluded
the
--
mr.
edward
mosk
--
question
of
the
--
of
whether
it's
a
proper
question.
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
alright.
putting
that
to
one
side,
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
ignoring
when
we
say
that
--
that
there
has
been
a
frustration.
we're
ignoring
the
fact
that
at
some
point
in
any
inquiry,
there
--
there
is
a
point
where
inquiry
must
stop
without
requiring
the
person
who
is
inquiring
to
proceed
further
with
the
evidence.
now,
what
we
have
here
is
a
judicial
finding,
in
effect,
by
this
court
that
he
was
a
person
of
good
moral
character.
mr.
edward
mosk
on
that
record.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
correct.
alright.
now,
we
come
to
the
new
record
with
the
--
at
the
hearing
subsequent
to
the
previous
decision
of
this
court
and
we're
now
faced
with
an
apparent
requirement
that
we
come
forward
with
some
answers
to
questions
which
had
already
been
asked
in
the
previous
record.
mr.
edward
mosk
oh,
i
--
i
--
mr.
edward
mosk
but
if
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
the
questions
were
identical.
the
only
change
is
the
preface
to
the
question
--
mr.
edward
mosk
--
but
the
questions
weren't
--
mr.
edward
mosk
well,
i
--
i
understand
the
distinction
that
--
that
you're
making,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
a
distinction
that
is
justified
under
the
facts
of
the
whole
case.
the
fact
is
that
the
questions
asked
at
the
first
hearing
and
prior
to
the
adjudication
of
the
court
here,
and
the
question
asked
at
the
second
hearing
were
identical
probably
even
word
per
word
the
same.
now,
based
upon
that,
this
court
did
make
a
finding
that
he
was
of
good
moral
character
and
that
he
did
not
advocate.
mr.
edward
mosk
based
upon
a
record
--
mr.
edward
mosk
but
based
upon
a
record
in
which
the
identical
question
had
been
asked
was
before
the
court,
now
asked
again
and
before
the
court
is
the
identical
question.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
i
would
concede
that
of
course,
your
honor,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
the
question
is
asked
following
the
history
of
this
case
in
the
whole
context
of
the
prioritization,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
adopted
by
mr.
justice
traynor
in
the
california
supreme
court
that
under
the
circumstances
of
the
whole
history
of
this
case,
it
was
at
least
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
come
forward
with
some
type
of
evidence
before
they
could
then
require
that
questions
that
are
already
been
asked
should
now
be
asked
again.
mr.
edward
mosk
was
not
adopted
--
mr.
edward
mosk
no,
your
honor,
this
--
mr.
edward
mosk
yes,
except
that
the
essence
of
mr.
justice
traynor's
dissent
even
though
the
exact
position
where
he
was
sitting
at
that
moment
was
somewhat
different
than
this
court.
the
essence
of
his
argument
was
the
fundamental
unfairness
which
when
translated
into
the
terms
of
our
position
before
this
court
is
simply
that
by
handling
the
manner
in
which
the
matter,
in
the
manner
in
which
the
state
of
california
handled
it,
the
state
of
california
was
denying
petitioner
due
process.
mr.
edward
mosk
why,
i
--
i
would
suspect
that
he
was
well
aware.
i
see
that
my
time
is
rapidly
approaching
an
end
and
i
do
want
to
reserve
with
the
court's
permission
sometime
to
respond
to
points
made
by
counsel.
i
--
i
feel
that
one
final
point
should
be
made
and
i
would
be
remising
not,
at
least
recognizing
the
existence
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
beilan
and
lerner.
i'm
well
aware
of
the
reliance
which
the
state
puts
on
these
cases.
and
in
view
of
shortness
of
time,
i
--
i
want
to
summarize
my
feeling
on
these
two
cases.
it
seems
to
me
that
first
of
all,
these
two
cases
were
situations
in
which
there
had
been
prior,
as
distinguished
from
the
question
that
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
earlier,
not
the
decision
in
the
case
itself
but
there
had
been
prior
determinations
of
the
courts
of
the
states
of
pennsylvania
and
new
york
that
failure
to
answer
questions
under
a
particular
situation
would
be
interpreted
by
the
court
as
incompetence
or
lack
of
candor
and
so
forth
and
there
would
be
--
and
therefore,
would
be
proper
grounds
for
dismissal.
in
this
case,
the
first
judicial
determination,
if
there
has
been
any
at
all,
would
be
the
very
decision
in
this
particular
case.
but
i
think
more
important
even
in
that
distinction
and
the
one
which
i
must,
with
all
sincerity
urge
upon
the
court,
is
that
there
is
a
fundamental
difference
between
an
employer-employee
relationship
as
exist
even
in
the
case
of
a
teacher
where
the
whole
question
of
academic
freedom
must
be
considered,
but
there
was
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
employer
and
employee,
the
asking
of
a
question
by
an
employer
and
the
obligation
of
the
employee
to
respond
to
that
question
and
the
asking
of
a
question
of
an
applicant
for
admission
to
the
independent
practice
of
the
law.
this
is
not
an
employer,
employee
relationship.
the
very
essence
of
the
relationship
is
the
very
contrary
of
employer-employee
relationship.
the
very
essence
of
the
relationship
is
the
independence
of
the
prospective
lawyer.
no
other
profession
has
the
responsibility
that
the
legal
profession
has
to
maintain
its
independence
from
the
state.
it
is
the
lawyer
who
must
take
the
position
of
representing
the
state
in
its
relationship
with
the
individual
and
by
the
same
token,
it
is
the
lawyer
who
must
stand
between
the
state
and
the
protection
of
the
individual.
and
if
we
ever
reach
the
point
where
we
consider
the
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
lawyer,
one
of
an
employer-employee
relationship,
i
submit
that
we
will
have
lost
some
of
the
fundamental,
the
very
fundamental
nature
of
the
independence
in
the
profession
of
the
law.
mr.
edward
mosk
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
would
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
talk
to
--
to
try
and
detract
in
any
manner
from
the
strictest
requirements
for
admission
to
the
bar.
this
is
not
our
position
at
all.
but
what
we
have
here
as
distinguished
from
the
--
the
kinds
of
questions
which
counsel
will
probably
argue
about
such
as
asking
age
and
--
and
commission
of
crime.
what
we
have
here
is
an
intrusion
into
the
first
amendment
area.
and
as
soon
as
you
that,
you'll
run
into
the
whole
problems
which
court,
of
course,
is
thoroughly
familiar
with,
of
beliefs
and
the
restrictions
against
future
applicants
for
the
bar
in
handling
themselves
in
the
future
so
that
they
will
not
run
up
against
the
kind
of
problems
that
konigsberg
run
into
here.
and
i
submit
that
the
very
theory
of
independence
of
the
bar
requires
that
we
take
greater
care
of
intrusions
into
the
first
amendment
area
than
in
any
other
area
of
--
of
life.
mr.
edward
mosk
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
think
that
what
you
come
to
on
those
questions,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
is
the
weighing
and
the
balance
of
the
value
of
the
questions
and
the
value
to
society
in
restricting
the
asking
of
those
questions.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
say
these
kinds
of
questions
are
--
are
of
no
great
moment
unless,
unless
there
was
some
issues
that
a
person
knew
that
if
his
views
were
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners,
they
weren't
going
to
allow
any
one
to
be
admitted
who
had
a
view
contrary,
let
say,
to
the
principle
of
the
integrated
bar.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
have
some
question
as
to
the
propriety
of
it
because
i
would
submit
that
these
are
not
matters
upon
which
his
answer
either
way
would
justify
his
being
denied
admission
to
the
bar.
and
i
feel
the
same
thing
about
the
questions
that
had
been
asked
here.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
would
suspect
the
supreme
court
of
california
would
not
permit
his
denial
on
that
basis.
and
i
--i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
edward
mosk
--
the
questions
had
moved
in
to
a
realm
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
do
not
believe
so,
no.
mr.
edward
mosk
they're
on
a
par,
your
honor,
except
insofar
as
weighing
them
in
the
balance
of
the
importance
to
society
that
we
not
intrude
into
the
area,
then
i
think
that
the
scales
are
quite
different.
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
not
sure
i
thoroughly
understand
the
question,
i
think
not
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
this
is
the
very
reason,
your
honor,
why
i
hesitated
to
speculate
because
i
think
it
is
not
really
to
the
heart
of
this
issue.
but
i
do
want
to
reserve
some
of
my
time
and
therefore,
i'll
--
mr.
edward
mosk
--
stop
at
this
time.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
shall
also
be
quite
brief,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
probably
a
very
few
matters
that
mr.
belcher
has
raised
that
has
not
been
covered
fairly
thoroughly
in
our
briefs.
there
are
a
couple
of
matters
on
which
the
record,
i
think,
should
be
made
clear
and
that
will
be
the
word
of
my
argument
at
this
point.
first
of
all,
on
the
last
point
made
by
mr.
belcher,
a
point
that
there
are
previous
cases
dealing
with
refusal
to
answer
questions
in
the
state
of
california.
i
submit
the
cases
do
not
bare
that
out.
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
belcher
in
the
--
in
his
brief
and
to
which
we
responded
at
least
briefly
in
our
closing
brief
are
cases
have
been
entirely
different
nature.
these
were
cases
involving
persons
who
have
falsified
their
statements
to
the
committee
of
bar
examiners.
these
are
state
--
these
are
cases
in
which
persons
were
found
after
they
had
filed
their
applications
to
have
been
disbarred
in
some
other
state
or
who
have
committed
some
crime
in
some
other
state,
not
a
single
one
of
those
cases
deals
with
the
situation
where
there
has
been
a
principal
refusal
to
answer
a
question
based
upon
high
moral
principles.
none
of
the
cases
are
even
related
to
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
citing
of
those
cases
as
authority
for
the
position
by
the
state
here
is
an
indication
of
their
lack
of
comprehension
of
the
nature
of
the
problem
that
we
have
before
the
court
that
is
a
principal
of
declination
based
upon
the
entire
first
amendment
situation.
now,
i
would
point
out
only
one
other
matter
and
that
is
the
beginning
of
mr.
belcher's
argument
in
which
he
read
quotations
from
the
record.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
each
of
the
quotations
that
are
read
to
the
court
at
this
time
were
read
from
the
first
hearings,
were
read
from
the
record
of
this
case
prior
to
the
time
that
this
matter
was
already
determined
by
the
court.
the
type
of
statement
and
the
nature
of
the
declination
which
was
read
to
you
were
the
declination
prior
to
the
1957.
and
i
submit
that
we
have
set
forth
in
detail
the
approach
that
mr.
konigsberg
took
on
the
return
and
it
is
quite
different,
not
in
principle,
but
different
in
approach
because
most
of
us
learn
something
about
how
to
approach
a
committee
over
a
number
of
years.
and
i
think
that
if
you
will
read
the
record,
and
as
i'm
sure
all
of
you
have,
of
the
--
the
more
recent
hearings,
you'll
find
that
there's
an
entirely
different
approach.
and
particularly
on
page
13
--
12
and
13
of
petitioner's
opening
brief,
you
will
find
the
quotations
from
mr.
konigsberg
in
which
he
--
not
only
did
he
say
that
he
would
answer
further
questions
relating
to
advocacy,
but
he
begged
the
committee
to
ask
any
questions
relating
to
specific
acts
of
wrongdoing.
he
was
no
longer
saying
that
you
could
not
cross-examine.
and
i
would
concede
that
prior
to
1957,
perhaps,
there
was
that
element
in
the
earlier
record.
i
don't
think
it
was
intended
in
a
manner
that
was
indicated
by
mr.
belcher's
reading
of
it
but
there,
perhaps,
was
that
element.
mr.
edward
mosk
but
--
mr.
edward
mosk
mr.
justice
whitaker,
there
could
have
been
that
implication
in
the
--
prior
to
the
1957
record.
that
implication
cannot
be
found
in
the
present
record
before
this
court.
mr.
edward
mosk
that
is
my
position,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
that
on
this
record
and
the
history
of
this
case
that
that
is
the
position
that
is
a
perfectly
proper
one.
he
took
the
position
and
he
said
to
the
committee,
"the
supreme
court
has
already
indicated
by
a
previous
decision
that
my
position
is
certainly
not
a
foolish
position,
that
it
is
a
principal
position.
now,
you
cannot
ask
me",
he
said
to
the
committee,
"to
change
this
principal
position
at
this
late
day
and
in
the
light
of
the
decision
of
this
court."
he
said,
however,
"if
you
will
ask
me
any
questions
about
any
kind
of
specific
wrongdoing,
any
questions
indicating
that
i
have
ever
anywhere
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence
or
any
other
act
of
impropriety
on
my
part,
i
will
respond
directly
to
that."
and
only
in
this
limited
area
did
he
say
that
"i
will
not
respond
to
the
questions,"
but
he
did
not
foreclosed
cross-examination
at
all.
it
was
just
that
the
committee
had
no
facts
upon
which
to
go.
the
committee
had
no
basis
for
proceeding
further.
they
have
no
information.
their
investigation
had
shown
nothing.
therefore,
the
committee
did
not
proceed
further
with
any
type
of
cross-examination.
so
that,
if
you
will
read
the
--
the
record
and
particularly
the
statements
on
pages
11
through
13
of
our
brief,
i
think
you
will
find
that
there
has
been
no
cutting
off
of
questioning
as
would
seem
to
have
been
indicated
by
mr.
belcher's
statements.
mr.
edward
mosk
and
so
we
submit
to
the
court
--
mr.
edward
mosk
--
this
time.
mr.
edward
mosk
i'm
sorry,
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
i,
perhaps,
did
not
answer
it
directly.
i
--
i
suppose
i
did
inferentially.
mr.
justice
stewart,
our
--
our
position
is
--
is
simply
this
that
just
as
the
first
time
that
this
case
was
before
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
by
refusing
to
refute
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
committee
of
bar
examiners
and
thereby
barred
to
konigsberg
from
admission
to
the
bar
had,
in
effect,
made
a
declaration
of
the
position
of
the
state
of
california
on
that
matter
and
in
effect,
had
approved
the
decision.
now,
when
this
matter
goes
back
a
second
time,
we
have
a
--
a
decision
of
the
supreme
of
california
which
states
a
reason
and
it
gives
the
language
of
a
state
--
a
state
ground.
but
i
submit
that
what
we
must
do
in
this
case
is
examine
the
entire
context
of
the
case
to
determine
whether
when
seen
in
the
entire
context
of
what
has
happened
in
the
konigsberg
case,
whether
or
not
there
has
not
been
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
determination
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
which
violates
due
process
of
law.
the
fact
that
they
--
this
court
has
frequently
said
but
the
fact
that
a
state
places
that
on
what
appears
on
the
surface
to
have
been
a
state
ground
does
not
mean
that
it
may
not
be
reviewed
to
determine
whether
or
not,
in
the
entire
picture
and
the
entire
context
of
it,
there
has
not
been
a
violation
of
due
process.
mr.
edward
mosk
i
could
not
disagree
with
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
edward
mosk
well
--
mr.
edward
mosk
my
red
light
is
here
but
i
will
like
to
--
mr.
edward
mosk
--
respond
to
the
question.
what
we
must
do
in
examining
any
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
is
determine
whether
in
the
entire
context
of
all
that's
happened,
what
the
state
has
done
is
what
it
says
it
is
doing.
now,
i
would
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
while
the
state
has
selected,
perhaps,
from
this
court's
decision
a
small
clause
and
then
has
attempted
to
go
through
that
door
to
a
decision,
what
they
are
doing,
in
effect,
is
endeavoring
to
destroy
the
effect
of
an
earlier
decision
of
this
court
which
made
certain
finding
relating
--
mr.
edward
mosk
perhaps
for
some
other
case
but
not
--
mr.
edward
mosk
--
not
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
i
cannot
--
mr.
edward
mosk
i
--
i
--
of
course,
i
could
not
quarrel
with
that,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
