justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
on
cross-examination,
did
he
not
throw
up
the
barrier
and
say,
"i'll
select
the
questions
i'll
answer?"
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
contend
that
--
that
this
man
would
take
the
stand
testifying
that
"i
am
of
good
moral
character,"
then
when
asked
on
cross,
"are
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
he
could
refuse
to
answer?
