mr.
frank
b.
belcher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
when
this
case
was
here
before,
all
of
the
members
of
this
court
with
but
one
exception
were,
of
course,
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
record
which
was
then
presented.
the
record
as
it
now
(inaudible)
before
this
court
is,
in
many
of
its
essential
aspects,
the
same
as
the
record
then
was.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir,
i
was
just
coming
to
those.
with
the
exception
that
some
three
and
one
half
years
expired
between
the
time
when
mr.
konigsberg
appeared
before
the
committee
and
made
the
record
on
which
this
case
was
here
before
and
the
time
when
he
came
before
the
committee
again
and
supplemented
that
record
into
the
record
which
is
now
before
this
court.
at
the
time
of
the
second
hearing,
mr.
konigsberg
again
became
a
witness.
mr.
konigsberg
introduced
traditional
letters
as
to
his
character.
mr.
konigsberg
called
and
examined
a
witness
who
justified
to
what
he
deemed
to
be
pertinent
matters.
so
the
record
to
that
extent
is
now
different.
also,
at
the
time
of
his
second
appearance
before
the
committee
and
the
making
of
the
record
now
before
this
court,
mr.
konigsberg
was
warned
in
terms
which
cannot
be
mistaken
or
misconstrued
that
any
failure
to
answer
the
relevant
and
pertinent
questions
of
the
committee
before
whom
he
was
then
appearing
would
be
deemed
grounds
by
that
committee
to
deny
his
certification
to
the
supreme
court
as
having
good
moral
character
and
he's
not
advocating
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
no
question
is
raised
here
at
this
time
as
to
the
nature
or
the
character
of
the
warning
which
was
given
mr.
konigsberg.
after
having
had
an
opportunity
of
some
three
and
a
half
years
to
think
over
the
refusals
which
he
had
made
before
to
answer
the
questions
which
were
asked
him,
he
declined
again
to
answer
a
single
one
of
those
questions
which
he
had
previously
declined
to
answer.
and
again,
testing
what
had
transpired
during
this
period
of
three
and
a
half
years,
the
committee
asked
him,
"are
you
now
a
member
of
the
communist
party?"
and
he
refused
to
answer
that.
they
asked
him
as
to
each
particular
year
from
1951
down
to
1957
on
this
hearing
was
had
which
now
makes
this
record.
and
he
refused
to
answer
any
of
those.
so
his
position
the
second
time
was
essentially
the
same
as
it
was
before
with
added
denials
to
similar
questions
and
with
the
reaffirmation
of
his
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
which
he
had
refused
before.
now,
i
think
it
maybe
somewhat
helpful
to
this
court
to
know
the
type
of
questions
which
this
man
has
persistently
refused
to
answer.
i'm
not
going
to
--
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
b.
belcher
and
the
record,
if
by
stipulation
at
the
time
of
the
last
hearing,
the
first
record
was
also
made
a
part
of
his
record
so
that
the
two
records
are
now
before
the
court
on
this
hearing.
now,
the
questions
which
mr.
konigsberg
did
try
to
answer
fall
essentially
into
three
categories.
one
of
them,
he
declined
to
answer
any
question
which
was
asked
him
with
respect
to
his
communistic
membership,
affiliations
or
associations.
i'm
not
going
into
those
because
they
were
quoted
almost
in
full
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
by
mr.
harlan
when
this
case
was
here
before.
i
do,
however,
want
to
say
this
that
i
cannot
accept
the
statement
which
mr.
mosk
paid
here
today
to
the
effect
that
mr.
konigsberg
has
answered
with
the
upmost
freedom
any
questions
relating
to
his
advocacy
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
mr.
konigsberg
said
this.
the
committee
can
only
ask,
“do
you
now
personally
advocate
the
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
of
this
state
by
force
or
violence
or
other
unconstitutional
means?
and
if
i
say,
no,
yes
or
whatever
it
may
be,
that
is
as
far
as
you
can
go.”
that
is
without
raising
a
question
on
this
point.
and
again,
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
contending
that
the
committee
was
bound
by
his
answer
yes
or
no
which
he
gave
and
he
said
that
he
was
that
the
committee
was
not
entitled
to
even
cross-examine
him
upon
that
score.
now,
with
the
summary
of
event,
these
questions,
which
are
in
the
other
opinion
before
this
court,
i
passed
to
a
second
category.
mr.
konigsberg
would
not
answer
a
question
as
to
his
association.
and
if
i
may
be
permitted,
mr.
justice
chief
justice,
i
want
to
read
just
a
sentence
out
of
an
opinion
of
this
court
and
then
read
a
sentence
out
of
mr.
konigsberg
testimony
in
order
that
the
two
may
just
be
laid
side
by
side.
in
the
atler
case,
this
court
said,
"once
associate
past
and
present
as
well
as
one's
conduct
may
properly
be
considered
in
determining
fitness
and
loyalty.
from
time
immemorial,
one's
reputation
has
been
determined
impart
by
the
company
he
keeps.”
that
declaration
has
then
affirmed
by
this
court
on
a
good
many
occasions.
quoting
now
from
mr.
konigsberg,
"i
respectfully
say
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
know
my
associations
and
any
person
may
refuse
to
answer
on
the
basis
of
the
rights
of
a
citizen
under
the
first
amendment
which
i
have
briefly
referred
you
with
my
testimony."
so
he
declined
to
be
examined
as
to
who
his
associates
were.
now,
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
before,
reference
was
made
to
a
series
of
editorials
which
this
man
had
written.
and
they
were
ragged
group
of
editorials.
he
criticized
everybody
from
the
sheriff
of
los
angeles
county
down
to
the
president
or
up
to
the
president
of
the
united
sates.
he
criticized
members
of
congress.
he
said
that
we
were
an
imperialist
nation,
that
we
were
waging
of
war
of
regression
in
korea.
he
impugn
the
integrity
of
this
court,
and
as
i
say,
just
summing
up
on
a
whole
labor
of
pretty
ragged
bunch
of
editorials.
now,
let
me
make
it
clear
as
i
did
before,
i
don't
question
the
man's
right
to
write
those
editorials.
but
i
do
say
that
the
character
of
those
editorials
made
it
imparity
that
the
committee
before
whom
he
was
appearing
at
least
asked
him
questions
about
--
about
those
editorials
and
that
they
deal.
they
asked
him,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
editorial
which
he
wrote
impugning
the
integrity
of
this
court,
"do
you
have
any
evidence
on
which
to
base
that
editorial?"
and
his
reply
was,
"these
writings
of
mine
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
you
have
no
right
to
interrogate
me
with
respect
to
them.
the
freedom
of
the
press
protects
me
in
writings
of
that
kind
whether
my
utterances
are
true
or
false."
now,
that's
almost
an
exact
quotation
of
the
statement
which
mr.
konigsberg
made.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
that's
queer
doctrine
for
a
man
seeking
admission
into
the
bar
of
the
state
of
california.
so
i
pass
from
there
and
so
much
for
the
record
which
we
are
here
upon
before
this
court.
the
next
question
that
rises
is
one,
perhaps,
involving
the
constitutionality
of
the
questions
which
this
committee
addressed
to
mr.
konigsberg.
we
are
very
akin
in
the
basic
concept
to
this
case
to
the
(inaudible)
case
which
was
just
argued.
we
have
certain
matters
in
common
with
the
cohen
case
which
will
follow
this.
but
i
am
going
to
dismiss
the
constitutional
question
very
briefly
for
the
reason
that
i
submit
that
it
has
been
answered
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
decisions
since
we
were
here
last
on
this
case
which
now
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
the
constitutionality
and
the
propriety
of
the
character
of
questions
which
were
addressed
to
mr.
konigsberg.
the
court
sets
we
were
here
before
has
decided
the
beilan
case,
the
(inaudible)
case,
the
nelson
case,
the
barenblatt
case
and
a
number
of
others.
and
i
think
it
may
now
be
accepted
without
question
as
the
rule
of
this
court
that
inquiry
into
the
membership
in
communist
organization
and
allied
questions
of
that
kind
and
character
are
now
permissible
on
constitutional
grounds
wherever
fitness
and
loyalty
are
in
issue.
so
i
shall
dismiss
the
constitutional
question
saying
that
we
rely
firmly
upon
those
particular
cases.
i
do,
however,
want
to
supplement
that
concept
by
one
further
statement.
our
state
supreme
court
has
held
that
these
questions
which
were
addressed
to
mr.
konigsberg
were
relevant
and
pertinent
questions.
and
i
adopt
the
suggestion.
i
advocate
the
suggestion
which
came
from
a
member
of
this
court
a
few
moments
ago
that
that
is
purely
a
state
question,
not
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
now,
there
are
some
contention
made
here
that
this
court
closed
the
door
upon
us
as
to
a
further
inquiry
in
to
mr.
konigsberg's
situation
before
we
admit
it.
it
maybe
somewhat
presumptuous
on
my
part
to
stand
here
and
tell
this
court
what
it
decided
before,
but
i
think
i
can
accept
certain
declarations
which
appear
in
the
opinion.
in
the
first
place,
this
court
before
declined
in
specific
words
to
pass
upon
the
constitutional
questions,
perhaps
it's
here
again
and
if
so,
i'm
willing
to
submit
it
on
the
authorities
which
i
have
cited.
in
its
opinion
before
this
court
declined
to
decide
whether
mr.
konigsberg
had
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
the
questions
which
he
refused
to
answer.
in
its
opinion
here
before
this
court
held
that
when,
as
and
if,
that
question
was
presented
to
the
court,
that
then
you
would
undertake
an
answer
to
the
problems
which
it
--
which
it
then
created.
and
with
those
declarations,
the
court
then
remanded
this
case,
not
with
directions
to
the
supreme
court
of
california
to
admit
mr.
konigsberg
to
the
practice
of
law,
but
with
directions
to
the
state
of
california
to
take
such
other
proceedings
as
it
might
be
advised
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
konigsberg
then
became
--
then
came
before
the
supreme
court
and
moved
that
on
the
basis
of
the
holding
of
this
court
that
there
was
--
that
we
had
--
that
california
had
previously
impermissibly
drawn
inferences
of
not
good
moral
character
and
not
to
adversity
--
to
overthrow
of
the
government,
that
upon
the
basis
of
those
determinations
that
he'd
be
admitted.
that
court
as
it
was
then
constituted
by
vote
of
6-to-1
declined
that
suggestion
and
referred
the
case
again
to
the
board
of
bar
examiners
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
abuse
which
have
been
expressed
by
this
court.
mr.
konigsberg
went
before
the
board
of
bar
examiners.
he
raised
the
same
question.
and
that
committee,
composed
of
distinguished
lawyers
of
the
california
state
bar,
refused
his
request
in
that
respect
unanimously.
they
declined,
not
this
time
on
the
basis
of
any
inferences
wrongfully
drawn
or
impermissibly
drawn,
but
solely
upon
the
basis
of
his
refusal
to
answer
questions
which
completely
thwarted
the
investigation
of
this
committee
into
the
two
questions
of
his
moral
character
and
whether
he
advocated
the
overthrow
of
the
government.
solely
upon
his
refusal
to
answer
those
questions,
the
board
of
bar
governors
declined
to
certify
his
--
him
to
the
supreme
court
as
being
eligible
for
admission.
and
that
court
then,
by
a
vote
of
5-to-1
held
that
this
--
that
the
prior
decision
by
this
court
did
not
estop
them
from
now
again
considering
mr.
konigsberg
position
in
the
light
of
his
refusal
to
answer.
and
by
that
vote
or
by
two
dissenting
votes,
mr.
traynor's
opinion,
however,
holding
specifically
that
the
court
had
a
right
to
again
consider
that
question,
they
declined
to
admit
mr.
konigsberg
to
practice.
now,
that's
the
record
as
it
now
stands.
there
is
but
one
other
point
which
has
been
raised
here
in
the
absence
of
some
questions
from
this
court
upon
which
i
shall
comment
briefly.
there
has
been
some
intimation
here
that
california
invented
a
new
ruling
for
the
purpose
of
excluding
mr.
konigsberg
that
this
was
something
made
expressly
for
him
that
is
not
born
out
by
the
record
of
our
state
at
all.
there
is
a
section
of
our
brief
devoted
to
that
question.
i
shall
not
here
repeat
it.
there
is
no
written
rule,
just
as
there
was
no
written
rule
in
the
beilan
case,
that
if
you
don't
answer,
you
will
be
excluded.
but
in
the
case
cited
in
our
brief,
our
supreme
court
has
held
starting
back
over
30
years
ago
that
the
utmost
candor
and
frankness
is
required
on
the
part
of
any
applicant
for
admission
to
the
court
that
they
must
answer
pertinent
inquiries
from
the
committee
inquiring
into
their
good
moral
character
and
so
on.
and
on
a
number
of
occasions,
five,
i
believe,
in
all
the
supreme
court
has
declined
to
admit
to
practice
law
because
of
refusal
to
answer
questions.
and
then
at
least
two
of
those,
certiorari
was
refused
by
this
court.
so
i
say
on
the
basis
of
the
cases
which
are
set
out
in
our
brief
that
it
has
long
been
the
rule
in
california
that
admission
to
practice
law
will
be
and
can
be
and
is
denied
to
one
who
refuses
to
answer
pertinent
questions.
unless
there
are
some
questions
from
this
court
upon
this
record
and
that
be
now
to
--
that
this
case
for
your
further
consideration.
thank
you.
