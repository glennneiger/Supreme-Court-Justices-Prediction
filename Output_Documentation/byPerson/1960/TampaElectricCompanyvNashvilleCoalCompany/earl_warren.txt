chief

we
will
recess
now
mr.
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
chanler,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
--
all
of
their
coal
mr.
chanler
of
this
particular
kind
of
coal
--
type
of
coal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
i
have
an
idea
there
were
different
--
different
kinds
of
coal,
boiler
coal,
or
coal
that
would
be
used
for
other
purposes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
coal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
my
question
was
prompted
by
curiosity.
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
--
that
this
wouldn't
be
as
much
as
1%
of
all
the
coal,
all
that
coal
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
it
go
--
would
only
be
infinite
testimonial
part
of
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
fortas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fortas,
i've
been
wondering
if
that
proportion
of
the
coal
under
this
contract
to
the
total
amount
in
use
in
part
is
of
any
great
value
to
us
because
the
situation
in
my
own
state
we
use
practically
no
coal
out
there.
and
they
--
if
one
small
utility
was
to
set
up
a
unit,
a
coal
unit
out
there
it
would
probably
--
it
could
be
more
than
the
whole
state
of
california
uses
of
coal
and
would
that
--
would
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
make
--
make
a
brief
statement
about
it.

justice

chanler.
