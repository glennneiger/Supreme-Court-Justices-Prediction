justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
what
wrong
does
your
argument
lead
for
requirement
contracts
under
section
3?
aren't
they
all
caught
in
a
substantial
way?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
that
is
--
come
pretty
close
to
the
issue
to
decide
which
cases
you
put
it
to
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
this
comes
on
a
summary
judgment.
none
of
the
--
none
of
the
seamen
which
this
contract
arouses
in
the
records
as
far
as

justice
john
m.
harlan
therefore
(inaudible)
seems
to
me
you're
asking
--
i'm
not
saying
that
you're
not
right
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
issue
you're
putting
to
us.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
your
leading
this
position
would
be
affected
if
the
case
did
--
was
tried
and
developed
that
there
were
sound
economic
reasons
for
this
kind
of
a
contract?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
comes
to
my
question
and
it
seems
to
me
this
was
escape
of
conclusion.
that's
what
they're
face
with
it
of
this
case
if
you
take
it
on
this
record.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
issue
that
you're
putting
to
us
is
the
question
of
whether
requi
--
any
requirement
contracts
short
of
(inaudible)
trying
to
approach
and
imagine
that
you
would
need
another
litigation
about
it
and

justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
the

the
actual
building
was
still
in
