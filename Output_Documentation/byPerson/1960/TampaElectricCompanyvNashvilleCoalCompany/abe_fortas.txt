mr.
abe
fortas
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
presentation
by
mr.
chanler,
i
find
it
necessary
briefly
to
state
for
the
court
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
will
then,
with
the
court's
permission,
proceed
to
address
myself
to
each
one
of
the
points
that
mr.
chanler
has
made
and
some
of
which
have
been
the
subject
of
inquiries
by
the
court.
but
it
is
first
essential,
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so,
that
we
be
clear
as
to
the
facts
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
chanler
began
by
what
was
perhaps
a
slip
of
the
tongue
saying
that
this
was
a
contract
to
supply
part
of
the
requirements
of
coal.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
complaint
which
appears
in
the
record
at
page
5
in
paragraph
8
and
towards
the
middle
of
that
paragraph
the
contractors
proscribed
as
a
contract
providing
for
the
sale
and
delivery
to
plaintiff,
that
is
the
petitioner
in
this
court,
of
all
--
of
all
of
the
coal
required
by
the
plaintiff
for
the
production
of
the
electric
energy
at
a
new
plant
it
was
constructing
near
tampa,
florida
for
a
period
of
20
years.
alright,
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
20-year
requirements
contract,
that
is
to
say
a
contract
to
supply
petitioner
here
with
all
of
the
coal
that
it
presently
requires
and
thus
found
by
the
courts
below.
with
all
of
the
coal
that
is
presently
required
and
presently
contemplated
a
full
requirements
contract
and
not
only
a
full
requirements
contract
but
if
the
court
please
a
full
requirements
contract
for
the
period
of
20
years
following
the
date
of
the
first
delivery.
now,
let
me
be
very
specific
about
this
contract.
the
contract
provided,
contemplated
that
the
petitioner
was
going
to
build
a
new
station,
the
gannon
station.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
had
two
other
stations
at
which
it
was
generating
electric
power.
those
two
existing
stations
burned
the
oil.
it
had
no
coal
facilities.
it
determined
to
build
the
gannon
station
and
entered
into
the
contract
which
is
here
in
issue.
that
contract
provides
that
there
will
first
be
constructed
two
units
in
the
gannon
station.
that
those
two
units
would
be
coal
burning
units
that
their
total
requirements
for
20
years
following
the
date
of
first
delivery
would
be
supplied
under
this
contract
all
of
their
requirements
that
if
and
when
the
petitioner
constructed
any
additional
units
at
this
gannon
station
to
burn
coal
and
it
had
the
theoretical
choice
anyway
of
deciding
whether
the
additional
units
would
burn
coal
or
burn
oil.
but
if
it
decided
within
10
years
at
any
time
within
10
years
after
this
contract
was
executed
to
build
an
additional
burn
--
coal
burning
unit
in
the
gannon
station
that
that
coil
burning
unit
would
automatically
being
covered
by
this
contract.
so
then
the
requirements
for
any
additional
coal
burning
units
at
the
gannon
station
would
automatically
be
withdrawn
from
any
possibility
of
competition
by
suppliers
of
coal
and
would
come
funder
the
preclusive
provisions
of
this
contract.
now
i
remember,
if
the
court
please,
the
petitioner
has
no
other
coal
facility,
no
other
coal
burning
facility.
it's
only
coal
burning
facilities
are
at
the
gannon
station.
they
are
necessarily
absolutely
covered
by
these
requirements
contract
for
a
period
of
20
years.
now,
the
after
this
litigation
was
begun
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
there
is
a
provision
on
the
contract
which
has
not
been
stressed
by
petitioner,
the
reason
i'll
come
to,
to
the
effect
that
15%
of
the
buyers'
requirements
at
any
kind
maybe
supplied
by
byproduct
fuels
supplied
by
any
costumer.
in
other
words
tampa
electric
reserve
to
itself
the
opportunity
to
take
15%
of
its
requirements
in
the
form
of
byproduct
fuel
if
and
when
such
was
furnished
to
tampa
electric
by
any
of
its
costumers.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart,
number
one
you
will
note
that
that
does
not
contemplate
getting
coal
from
anybody
else.
number
two,
this
is
so
far
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
from
this
years,
it's
purely
theoretical
possibility
that
perhaps
sometime
--
mr.
abe
fortas
there
was
a
provision
in
the
contract
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
totally
--
that
depends
mr.
justice
upon
whether
the
principle
--
what
principle
is
about
the
looking
of
this
contract.
i
believe
as
both
courts
below
held
that
the
contract
should
be
reasonably
construed
in
the
light
of
the
realities
and
one
of
the
unrealities,
if
i
may
say
so
here,
is
the
talk
in
which
petitioner
has
engaged
about
the
possibility
that
it
may
at
sometime
converts
one
of
its
oil
burning
plants
to
the
use
of
coal.
now,
as
the
courts
below
said
that
there
was
no
prospect
to
do
that
there
is
no
plan
to
do
it.
petitioner
in
his
brief
states
--
let
me
withdraw
that
to
cite
first.
after
this
litigation
was
begun
petitioner
received
a
letter
from
the
peabody
coal
company
to
which
mr.
chanler
has
referred.
that
letter
offered
to
supply
coal
to
be
used
in
one
of
the
petitioner's
present
oil
burning
plants
if
petitioner
should
convert.
now
note,
the
record,
as
the
record
here
indicates
it
is
no
simple
matter
to
turn
from
coal
to
oil
in
an
electric
utility
plant.
they
themselves
say
that
it
cost
them
$3
million
to
construct
coal
burning
facilities
here
at
gannon
then
if
they
had
used
oil.
note
number
two
that
as
petitioner
states
in
--
in
its
reply
brief
which
is
in
clear
statement
of
it,
the
offer
of
peabody
coal
was
rejected
and
they
never
went
--
they
never
accepted
that
offer,
so
that
the
situation
remains
entirely
theoretical.
i
may
say
mr.
justice
that
the
mere
possibility
that
someone
may
use
another
fuel
as
i
was
coming
through
later
in
my
argument
does
not
lift
a
contract
from
a
requirement's
contract
into
something
less
than
a
requirements
contract
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
noted
in
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
standard
oil,
the
requirements
contracts
there
replied
only
to
particular
stations
and
it
was
urged
that
the
contracting
buy
might
get
another
station
which
would
not
be
bound
by
the
exclusive
contract
which
stand
at
all
--
i'm
willing
what
the
court
concluded
that
that
was
a
no
matter.
similarly
in
the
standard
fashion
case
which
is
sort
of
the
grand
daddy
and
one
of
the
ancestors
in
this
field,
the
exclusive
contract
there
covered
the
sail
of
patents
to
buyers
on
--
at
their
particular
stores,
their
particular
premises.
it
was
there
said
just
as
petitioner
here
says,
well,
if
i
may
have
another
story
says
we
may
have
another
plant
to
use
coal
and
at
that
other
store
in
the
standard
fashion
we
may
buy
some
patents
from
somebody
else.
but
this
court
there
again
rejected
that
argument
and
as
the
two
courts
below
here
have
said
you
must
look
at
the
real
situation
not
the
existing
situation
not
at
possible
possibilities.
mr.
abe
fortas
it
shows
more
than
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
actually
as
the
record
shows,
a
third
unit
was
actually
constructed
to
burn
coal
and
was
under
the
contract.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
think
so
mr.
justice
as
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
the
contract
shows
--
as
the
contract
show
six
units
were
contemplated
and
also
--
it's
also
fair
inference
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
tampa
electric
could
have
decided
that
any
one
of
those
units
would
not
burn
coal.
now,
there's
another
fact
that
is
relevant
here.
you
will
note
--
i
think
it
was
mr.
justice
harlan
who
asked
about
the
--
no
i
believe
in
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
beg
your
pardon,
asked
about
the
replacement
contract.
there
was
a
replacement
contract
and
it
is
in
the
record
at
page
20
--
pages
26
and
27.
now
you
will
note
on
page
27,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
abe
fortas
27
of
the
record;
that
the
coal
requirements
for
the
gannon
--
for
the
gannon
stations
stated
in
this
replacement
contract
with
the
levin
ames
coal
company
were
estimated
to
increase
to
about
2,250,000
tons
per
year.
now
the
minimum
requirement
stated
in
the
contract
per
unit
was
225,000
tons
per
unit
per
year.
now,
this
2,250,000
ton
estimate
here
would
indicate
that
the
--
there
was
a
contemplation
of
tampa
electric
company
that
all
of
the
units
to
be
installed
at
gannon
would
be
coal
burning.
we
have
the
mathematical
computation
set
out
in
our
brief
and
i
will
pause
to
develop
that
here.
but
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
yes
your
honor
i
believe
that
it
is
a
fair
inference
that
it
was
always
contemplated
that
certainly
more
than
two
units
positively
with
respect
to
three,
certainly,
more
than
two
of
these
units
would
be
coal
burning
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
believe
that
it's
fair
to
infer
that
it
was
in
contemplation
that
all
of
them
would
be
covered.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
is
petitioner's
figures
to
what
it
costs.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
would
doubt,
mr.
justice.
that
is
to
say
once
the
station
is
set
up
i
used
to
have
some
do
it
coal
industry
once
a
station
is
set
up
for
coal
burning
units
i
doubt
very
much
that
source
--
a
matter
of
fact
precise
converse
of
that
might
be
true.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir,
and
it
might
be
more
economic
to
put
in
a
particular
coal
unit
in
the
station
designed
to
burn
coal.
mr.
abe
fortas
no.
your
honor,
you
see,
that's
a
totally
different
and
disconnected
station.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
know
either,
mr.
justice,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
here
--
mr.
abe
fortas
exactly.
yes
sir.
and
the
terms
of
this
contract
are
clear,
they're
definite,
they
covered
every
ounce
of
coal
that
this
company
utilized
or
could
buy
at
--
to
use
in
its
facilities
at
this
time
and
this
is
-
in
short,
a
full
requirements
contract.
now
let
me
hasten
along
if
i
may
here.
there
wasn't
any
coal
delivered
under
this
contract.
this
is
not
a
case
of
partial
performance.
the
seller
terminated
the
contract
before
the
delivery.
the
action
here
that
has
been
brought
by
the
petitioner,
it
is
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
as
it
appears
in
the
record
on
page
6.
the
complaint
asked
for
this
relief,
the
complaint
asked
that
this
court
declares
the
contract
to
be
a
valid,
lawful,
and
enforceable
contract
and
binding
upon
the
plaintiff
and
defendants
according
to
its
terms.
of
course,
if
the
contract
is
unlawful,
i
should
think
it
would
follow
that
the
court
cannot
enter
a
judgment
to
the
effect
that
it
is
valid,
lawful,
and
enforceable,
and
is
binding
upon
the
plaintiff
and
defendants
according
to
its
terms.
actually,
what
petitioner
is
seeking
here
is
an
order
from
this
court
to
the
defendants
to
compel
the
defendants
for
20
years
to
perform
a
contract
which
in
our
contention
is
unlawful
and
if
i
may
anticipate
myself
a
little
bit
here,
the
interest
the
--
mr.
chanler
made
a
very
interesting
statement
at
the
conclusion
of
his
argument.
he
said
that
the
buyer,
namely,
petitioner
could
compel
the
seller
to
perform,
but
that
the
seller
could
not
compel
the
buyer
to
perform.
i
know
of
no
such
contract
and
no
such
decree
that
can
be
entered
into
our
system
of
law.
now
i'll
come
to
that
in
more
detail
in
a
moment
i
hope.
now,
let
me
get
to,
quickly
get
to
the
amounts
covered
by
this
contract.
the
amounts
are
set
forth,
the
actual
amount
is
set
forth
in
the
replacement
contract,
the
levin
ames
contract
to
which
i
refer
a
moment
ago
and
they're
set
out
on
page
27.
they
begin
with
350,000
tons
in
1958.
they
rise
from
one
million
tons
in
1961
and
then
to
increase
as
required
to
about
2,250,000
tons
per
year.
now,
what
--
in
dollar
terms
what
does
that
mean?
in
dollar
terms,
let's
take
the
one
million
tons
figure
from
1961.
under
the
minimum
specified
in
this
contract
that
means
$6,400,000
a
year
and
a
$128,000,000
over
the
20
years
of
the
contract.
of
course
it's
greatly
more
to
use
as
your
base
not
the
one
million
tons
but
the
2,250,000
tons.
now,
as
the
court
below
found
and
as
petitioner
admits
just
taking
the
700,000
thousand
tons,
if
you
please,
embraced
by
this
contract
for
the
year
1960
that
is
equal
to
the
total
amount
of
coal
used
and
sold
in
all
of
peninsula,
florida
in
the
year
1959
which
was
also
700,000
tons.
petitioner
concedes
and
the
courts
below
so
found
that
within
a
few
years,
the
gannon
station
covered
by
this
contract
will
consume
more
coal
than
it
is
presently
consuming
in
the
entire
state
of
florida.
let's
take
another
measure
here.
in
terms
of
fuel
equivalent,
the
coal
requirements
for
the
gannon
station
exceed
all
of
the
oil
burned
in
petitioners
other
plants.
now,
i'm
just
taking
this
in
terms
of
energy
equivalence.
now,
so
that
our
point
which
i
hope
i'll
have
time
to
elaborate
in
a
moment,
if
your
honors
please,
with
respect
to
the
amounts
engrossed
by
this
contract
is
that
this
contract
engrosses
so
much
coal
that
its
competitive
effect
is
so
great
that
whether
you
take
the
minority
of
the
majority
opinions
of
this
court
or
take
any
standards
that
anybody
has
ever
referred
to,
this
contract
meets
the
qualifying
clause
of
section
3
of
the
clayton
act.
in
the
first
place,
if
you
take
the
amounts
standing
by
themselves
they
are
certainly
substantial.
they
are
huge.
this
contract
engrosses
a
huge
amount
of
coal.
if
you
take
the
amount
and
compare
it
on
any
reasonable
market
basis,
this
contract
is
huge
and
embraces
a
large
share
of
the
market.
i
am
sorry
to
--
but
perhaps
i'd
rather
take
time
to
comment
upon
mr.
chanler's
suggestion
about
what
the
market
ought
to
be.
mr.
chanler
says
that
you
ought
to
take
us
some
market,
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
atlantic
coast.
why?
because
he
says
that
florida
might
draw
upon
producers,
700
of
them
according
to
this
record
who
supply
--
who
supply
in
the
area
from
the
rocky
mountain
to
the
atlantic
coast.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
those
producers
also
sell
coal
in
foreign
countries
but
obviously,
that
is
not
the
market.
the
market
is
the
consumer
market.
let
us
take
this
kind
of
a
situation
quickly
to
illustrate
the
point.
let's
suppose
that
general
motors
came
into
the
district
of
columbia
or
in
the
new
york
city
and
made
a
contract
in
restrain
of
trade
or
a
price
fixing
agreement
in
one
of
those
areas.
now,
what
is
the
market?
first
thing
we
are
lawyers
doing
antitrust
basis
and
say,
what
is
the
market
in
the
section
of
one
case.
what's
a
market?
oh,
the
market
is
the
district
of
columbia
or
the
market's
new
york
city.
the
market
certainly
is
--
is
not
every
place
in
the
world
where
general
motor
sells
cars.
if
that
was
so
general
motors
could
pick
out
the
district
of
columbia
and
monopolize
that
and
ford
could
monopolize
some
other
place
and
so
on.
the
market
is
the
consuming
market.
let
me
put
it
more
precisely
as
--
mr.
abe
fortas
but
in
terms
of
geography,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
market
is
either
and
were
alright
on
any
basis.
peninsular
florida
or
all
of
florida
or
it
is
the
market
as
defined
under
the
old
bituminous
coal
act
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
which
included
peninsula
florida
and
a
finger
up
in
to
georgia.
that
was
based
upon
taking
into
account
the
freight
rate
structure
and
the
common
factors
that
operate
in
a
market.
the
one
structured
as
far
--
as
far
as
it
could
possibly
be
stretched
further
that
it
can
be
stretch,
you'd
say
florida
and
georgia
going
beyond
bituminous
coal
act.
we've
got
some
figures
in
our
brief
on
florida
and
georgia
because
there
the
only
current
figures
available.
there
are
no
figures
or
current
figures
on
the
market
as
defined
in
the
bituminous
coal
act.
you
take
all
of
florida
and
georgia,
mr.
justice,
this
contract
taking
just
the
one
million
ton
and
that
the
--
taking
just
the
one
million
ton
requirements,
not
the
two
million
250,000,
includes
18%
of
that
huge
and
excessively
huge
market.
that's
in
out
brief,
the
appropriate
references.
though
i
say
no
matter
what
the
standard
is,
this
--
this
is
a
--
a
quantitatively
a
contract
that
satisfies
standards.
now,
--
mr.
abe
fortas
it
would
mean
--
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
approach
the
problem
this
way.
the
standard
as
establish
by
the
cases
in
this
court
is
whether
if
--
under
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
is
whether
the
quantity
engross
by
the
coun
--
contract
is
not
in
substantial
or
not
insignificant.
here,
it
is
very
substantial.
the
law
under
section
3
as
announced
by
this
court
is
confined
to
that
standard.
is
it
a
not
insignificant
or
not
insubstantial
amount?
i
merely
wanted
to
go
a
little
further
in
an
attempt
to
impress
upon
the
court
the
fact
that
even
if
you
measure
this
by
a
market
standard,
even
if
you
measure
it
by
sherman
act
standard
which
you
shouldn't
do,
of
course,
under
your
decisions,
this
is
an
enormous
contract
that
satisfies
the
qualifying
clause.
now,
your
question
to
me
is
whether
the
competitor
--
whether
a
contract
would
still
meet
the
qualifying
clause
if
it
were
for
a
new
commodity
introduced
into
a
particular
community.
i
believe
i
state
that
forever.
that
is
precisely
one
of
the
considerations
considered
in
the
standard
oil
case.
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
for
the
court
there
and
rejected
in
that
case
as
something
that
congress
did
not
have
in
mind
in
terms
of
section
3,
and
i
think
properly
so
and
let
me,
if
i
may,
elaborate
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
do
in
many
commercial
situations
as
every
lawyer
knows
is
entered
into
requirements
contracts.
the
requirements
contracts
makes
everybody
feel
nice
and
secured,
but
what
it
does
is
to
remove
a
whole
area
of
our
economy
from
competition
pro
tanto
with
the
requirements
contracts.
now
let's
take
this
case.
here,
we
had
not
only
a
requirements
contract,
we
got
a
requirements
contract
for
20
years,
if
you
please.
now,
the
coal
industry
is
a
depressed
industry.
the
--
there
are
700,
according
to
petitioner's
admission,
producers
of
coal
who
are
able
and
eager
to
supply
this
company
with
coal.
there's
a
very
vivid
statement
by
the
president
of
this
company
that
is
in
the
record
saying
that
sellers
of
coal
were
in
and
out
of
his
office
so
fast,
if
you
please
and
so
many
of
them,
if
you
please,
that
his
secretary
couldn't
find
any
place
to
let
them
sit.
it's
on
page
62
of
the
record.
now,
what
does
this
contract
mean?
this
contract
means
that
for
20
years
these
people
have
no
look
in.
i
suppose
every
utility
company
did
that,
if
your
honors
please.
about
a
quarter,
one
quarter
of
the
bituminous
coal
in
this
country
is
consumed
by
electric
utilities
companies.
they
are
large
buyers.
they
are
principal
buyers.
if
this
court
ever
gave
its
sanction
to
that
kind
of
a
deal,
this
kind
of
a
preclusive
contract,
i
need
not
to
elaborate
on
what
it
would
mean
to
the
bituminous
coal
industry.
it
would
mean
instead
of
having
a
lot
of
little
coal
producers
who
live
by
reason
of
orders
from
time
to
time
from
utility
companies,
you
would
necessary
have
a
few
big
companies.
and
those
few
big
companies,
if
you
please,
would
in
effect
be
kept
to
the
consumers.
there
are
many
ways
of
skinning
a
cat
in
economic
relationships.
a
utility
company
does
not
have
to
buy
a
coal
mine
for
example,
to
get
it
captive.
it
can
make
a
long
term
requirements
contract
and
it
is
just
this
sort
of
thing
that
the
clayton
act
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
and
has
so
eloquently
pointed
out
in
my
opinion
in
the
standard
oil
of
california
is
just
this
sort
of
thing,
that
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
was
intended
to
reach
in
its
incipiency.
now,
mr.
chanler
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
well
--
mr.
abe
fortas
or
in
the
time
in
the
patent,
mr.
justice
and
here
we
have
a
time
that
is
greater
than
a
patent
and
what
always
comes
to
my
mind
is
the
statement
that
the
three-judge
court
made
in
the
pullman
case
as
a
competition
killer,
the
long
term
contract
is
a
powerful
weapon.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
would
tell
–
i'll
say
this
--
i'll
deal
with
it
now
mr.
justice.
the
20-year
provision
here
in
my
opinion
although
i
don't
believe
the
court
need
reach
this,
but
together
with
the
other
facts
of
this
contract.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
say
didn't
reach
what
i'm
about
to
come
to,
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
i
was
about
to
say
that
the
20-year
provision
coupled
with
the
other
provisions
in
this
contract
in
my
opinion,
making
it
also
violative
of
sherman
act.
i
don't
believe
the
court
need
to
reach
sherman
act
provision
here.
there
is
absolutely
when
we
get
to
the
sherman
act,
of
course,
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
terms
of
reasonableness
in
some
cases
and
the
tying
cases,
you'll
look
at
the
question
of
dominance
under
the
sherman
act
but
not
under
the
clayton
act.
but
you
also
look
at
–
you
may
also
look
at
other
things
bearing
upon
reasonableness.
20-year
contract
here
was
totally
--
is
totally
indefensible
as
a
matter
of
law.
now,
your
honor,
we
recall
that
in
the
standard
oil
case,
you
pointed
out
that
we
may
assume
that
the
contracts
here
involved
in
standard
oil
are
not
excessive
in
duration.
you
remember
that
great
many
of
them
were
six-month
contracts
and
with
the
--
even
without
that,
she
went
on
to
the
coaling
and
that
leading
case,
but
here,
we
have
a
requirements
contract,
we
have
it
for
20
years.
now
what
they
do
when
they
made
a
replacement
contract?
as
the
record
shows
a
contract
with
levin
ames
on
pages
26
and
27
of
the
record
was
cancelled
upon
12
months
notice.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
year-to-year
contract.
now,
did
that
take
care
of
its
needs?
well,
i
think
the
best
evidence
of
that
is
a
statement
that
mr.
chanler
has
in
his
reply
brief
and
i
don't
know
this
goes
outside
of
the
record.
it's
in
his
reply
brief.
this
sports
public
utilities
fortnightly
as
saying
that
as
of
september
1960
--
as
of
september
1960,
after
the
lower
court
opinions
in
this
case
that
tampa
electric
is
thinking
about
building
a
new
coal
station
which
will
begin
operations
at
the
end
of
the
1960,
that
is
to
say
as
around
1970
that
would
be
after
this
contract
has
operated
along
for
13
years.
now
what
i'm
saying,
mr.
justice,
with
respect
to
the
time
factor
here,
is
that
if
we
take
this
case,
the
time
factor,
in
this
case
standing
alone
makes
it
clear
and
beyond
dispute
that
the
qualifying
clause
of
section
3
is
satisfied.
that
is
to
say,
this
--
since
this
ties
up
commerce
for
20
years
in
most
certainly
has
a
tendency
to
restrain
trade
or
to
create
monopoly.
so
we
have
here
two
rather
staggering
facts
in
my
opinion.
first
is
a
tremendous
volume
of
the
commerce
that's
tied
up,
and
second,
is
a
practically
extraordinary
length
of
time,
a
20-year
contract.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
well,
i
think
those
two
considerations
are
interacting.
you
asked
me
whether
--
any
requirements
contract.
mr.
abe
fortas
oh,
yes.
i
don't
take
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
mr.
abe
fortas
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i've
noticed
that
myself,
mr.
justice,
but
mr.
justice,
i
want
to
make
my
position
perfectly
clear
on
this.
let's
--
in
terms
of
the
law
as
it
exists
today,
established
by
the
cases
of
this
court,
a
full
requirements
contract
is
unlawful
if
and
only
if
it
made
attempts
substantially
to
restrain,
create
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly.
to
satisfy
that
so
called
qualifying
clause,
the
cases
in
this
court
say,
in
a
section
3
clayton
act
case,
you
look
only
to
whether
the
contract
involves
a
substantial
or
not
insubstantial
amount
of
commerce.
now,
that
is
the
law
of
this
court
as
i
understand
it
and
i
don't
want
to
be
misunderstood
if
i
may
say
so.
i
am
not
--
i
--
i
believe
that's
the
law
i
believe
in
that
as
the
law.
i'm
saying
merely
that
this
contract
in
the
circums
in
--
that
this
contract,
this
record
goes
far
beyond
that.
now,
i
want
to
quickly
to
get
to
some
other
points
from
mr.
chanler's
statement.
mr.
chanler's
state
of
four
criteria
here
and
i'm
always
surprise
when
i
hear
him
say
them
because
they're
directly
contrary
to
the
rulings
of
this
court.
first,
he
says
that
--
first
he
talked
about
coal
and
oil.
coal
is
a
separate
line
of
commerce
for
purposes
of
the
clayton
act,
for
the
purposes
of
section
3.
i've
already
covered
this.
it's
covered
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
you
cannot
measure
the
extent
of
the
engrossment
of
this
contract
by
going
to
oil.
indeed
you
couldn't
--
couldn't
even
do
it
for
purposes
of
the
sherman
act
case
much
less
to
a
particular
kind
of
agreement
that's
here
involved.
mr.
chanler
likes
to
refer
to
cello
--
to
cellophane
whether
--
it's
dupont
case
the
cellophane
case,
but
it's
very
significant
that
even
in
cellophane
in
which
was
a
monopoly
case
if
you
please
and
in
--
in
which
you
market
concept
has
to
be
search
very
carefully
this
court
said
that
you
would
not
take
--
you
must
not
take
into
account
for
it.
you
must
not
assume
for
its
example
that
wood,
coal
--
that
wood,
cement
and
steal
although
they're
all
building
materials,
all
constitute
of
market
said
that
each
one
of
them
has
sufficient
distinctive
characteristics
so
that
you
must
define
the
market
for
each
separately.
and
in
the
general
motors
case,
the
dupont-general
motors
case,
this
court
said
that
automobile
paints
and
fabrics
constitute
separate
and
distinct
lines
of
commerce,
that
was
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
that
you
look
to
the
peculiar
characteristics
and
uses
of
each.
in
van
camp
the
--
where
we
have
got
that
brief,
what
the
point
is,
that
certainly
oil
and
coal
here
are
not
interchangeable
in
any
sense,
not
even
for
sherman
act
purposes.
and
when
you
come
to
the
very
point
prohibitions
of
section
3,
they
are
certainly
distinct
of
lines
of
commerce,
but
i
want
to
get
mr.
chanler's
second
point.
mr.
chanler
wants
this
court
to
rule
that
this
--
a
contract
does
not
violate
section
3
unless
the
seller
has
economic
leverage
sufficient
to
impose
the
condition.
now
i
thought
that
was
all
settled.
it's
very
interesting,
mr.
chanler
in
his
principal
brief
here
for
the
petitioner
didn't
mention
times-picayune
although
we
have
briefed
it
below,
it
came
rather
toward
only
in
his
reply
brief.
but
in
times-picayune,
this
court
very,
which
was
a
sherman
act
case,
this
court
very
carefully
delineated
the
distinction
in
this
respect
between
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act,
and
i
want
to
quote
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
for
the
court.
from
the
tying
cases,
perceptible
pattern
emerges.
under
the
clayton
act
if
the
seller
enjoys
a
monopolistic
position
in
the
market
for
the
tying
product,
or,
and
that
is
underlined
in
the
opinion,
or
a
substantial
volume
of
commerce
in
the
tied
product
is
restrained,
the
arrangement
violates
the
narrower
standards
of
section
3.
but
under
the
sherman
act,
both
conditions
must
exist.
that
is
the
statement
of
the
law
as
it's
been
established
and
as
it's
been
followed.
under
the
sherman
act,
dominance
or
monopoly
power
by
the
seller
is
quite
unnecessary.
the
reason
for
that
as
pointed
out
in
the
standard
oil
is
that
section
3
of
the
sherman
act
is
--
of
the
clayton
act,
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
is
a
highly
particularized,
specific
prohibition
against
contracts
that
exclude
a
competitor
or
competitors
of
the
seller
from
any
line
of
commerce.
under
the
sherman
act,
all
we
look
to
is
a
general
statement,
general
condemnation
of
contracts
in
restrain
of
trade
and
a
general
condemnation
of
contracts
in
restrain
of
trade
must
be
viewed
from
the
point-of-view
of
the
rule
of
reason.
it
maybe
under
the
sherman
act
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
seller's
dominance
and
the
mere
fact
that
a
tying
contract
was
entered
into
is
enough
per
se
to
show
that
the
contract
was
unreasonable,
but
you
must
show
the
purposes
of
the
sherman
act
that
contract
was
unreasonable.
for
the
clayton
act,
that
is
not
so
as
was
exhaustibly
analyzed
in
standard
oil.
for
purposes
of
section
3
of
the
clayton
act,
you
must
show
only
two
things.
one,
that
what
is
involved
is
a
contract
on
the
condition
understanding
or
with
the
effect
of
foreclosing
a
competitor
or
competitors
of
the
oil,
and
number
two,
you
must
show
only
that
the
effect
of
the
arrangement
may
be,
may
be
substantial
to
restrain
commerce
or
to
tend
to
create
a
monopoly.
so
mr.
chanler's
point
in
affect
that
the
seller
must
have
economic
dominance
or
economic
leverage
or
no
matter
what
choice
of
words
he
may
select
is
completely
in
opposition
to
the
holdings
of
this
court.
now
let's
get
to
the
next
one.
mr.
chanler
says
that
this
is
the
first
case
under
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
involving
a
single
contract
between
a
single
consumer,
a
single
buyer
and
a
single
seller.
that
is
true.
this
court
has
never
had
such
case
before
it
but
it
reminds
me
a
bill
of
the
distinction
on
the
basis
of
the
red-haired
man
with
the
squint
on
his
left
eye.
all
the
principles
announced
by
this
court
cover
this
case
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
we
need
to
do
is
to
look
at
the
statute.
if
the
court
will
kindly
turn
to
page
two
of
our
brief,
this
grey
brief,
we
have
set
forth
the
statute
and
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with
it
but
i
want
to
call
the
attention
of
a
few
particulars
in
the
statute.
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
lease
or
make
a
sale
or
contract
for
sale
or
use
consumption
or
a
resale
on
the
condition
agreement
or
understanding
that
the
lessee
or
purchaser,
note
the
single
bearer
shall
not
use
or
deal
in
the
goods,
wares,
merchandise,
machinery,
commodities
etcetera
of
a
competitor
or
competitors.
in
this,
there's
no
question.
but
that
that
language
includes
a
single
contract
was
intended
to
include
a
single
contract
and
if
anyone
chooses
to
enter
the
maze
of
legislative
history
here
despite
the
court's
--
this
court's
admonition
of
the
contrary
in
the
standard
fashions
case,
i
am
sure
he
must
conclude
that
the
congress
intended
to
reach
a
contract
in
a
town
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
pointed
out
in
the
standard
oil
and
as
is
shown
in
the
legislative
history.
in
the
good
year
of
1914,
good
in
some
respects,
the
congress
was
very
much
concerned
about
antitrust.
it
was
very
much
concerned
about
monopoly.
it
was
very
much
dissatisfied
with
what
had
happened
under
the
sherman
act
and
section
3
along
with
the
other
particular
sections
of
the
clayton
act
were
written
for
the
purpose
of
catching
up
these
situations
in
their
incipiency.
i,
myself
don't
see
how
anybody
can
read
the
legislative
history
of
the
clayton
act
without
being
bewildered
in
particular
by
being
--
being
certain
in
general
that
the
congress
intended
to
leave
no
loopholes
not
to
write.
congress
did
not
write
section
3
for
the
purpose
of
providing
an
escape
on
the
basis
of
a
single
contract
with
a
--
between
a
single
buyer
and
a
seller,
but
that
it
intended
to
cover
all
such
contracts.
let
me
take
this
for
as
an
illustration.
let's
suppose
mr.
chanler
in
his
remarks
i
believe
before
lunch
referred
to
sears
roebuck
and
a&p.
now
let's
take
that.
let
us
suppose,
if
you
please,
that
sears
roebuck,
one
enterprise,
a
largest
retailer
by
far
in
this
country,
let
us
suppose
that
sears
roebuck
entered
into
a
contract
with
a
single
textile
company
for
all
of
the
white
goods
as
they
call
in
that
business,
cover
sheets
and
so
on,
all
that
sears
roebuck
needed
and
entered
into
that
contract
for
a
20-year
period.
now
the
textile
industry
is
in
a
bad
way
too
and
there'd
be
thousands
of
textile
producers,
hundreds
of
them
i
should
say,
who
would
be
excluded
for
any
chance
at
sears
roebucks
business
for
20
years
but
that's
a
contract,
a
single
contract
if
you
please,
a
--
between
a
single
seller
and
a
single
buyer.
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
that
would
be
prohibited
by
section
3
or
let's
take
du
point
general
motors
and
if
i
may,
let
--
if
i'll
ask
you
to
assume
for
me
the
absence
of
any
stab
(ph)
connection
between
them
from
any
ownership
or
start
between
the
two.
and
let
us
suppose
that
general
--
that
du
point
and
general
motors
entered
into
a
contract
for
automobile
fabrics
and
paint
for
20
years
which
would
preclude
all
competitors
who
might
want
to
sell
automobile
fabrics
and
paint.
can
there
be
any
doubt
that
that
would
be
caught
by
the
provisions
of
section
3?
so
i
say
that
number
one,
this
court
has
precluded
the
argument
that
any
dominance
by
the
seller
is
needed.
number
two,
that
this
--
that
the
statute
in
all
reason
show
that
a
sing
--
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
we're
dealing
with
a
single
contract
or
many
contracts,
a
single
buyer
or
many
buyers.
the
important
--
two
important
questions
are
-
first,
is
this
a
requirements
contract
in
the
sense
that
it
excludes
a
competitor,
a
competitor
or
competitors
of
the
seller
and
second,
does
it
have
a
prescribed
effect
on
competition.
now
finally
and
i
will
quit
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
would
not
think
so
mr.
justice.
in
actual
practice,
of
course
we
try
to
avoid
the
requirements
contracts
in
the
sense
that
the
--
we
--
the
law
as
i
have
understood
it
has
always
meant
that
you've
got
to
leave
room
for
competition
to
come
in.
and
for
example,
even
if
we
have
--
even
if
we
want
to
get
somebody
to
build
a
new
plant
to
supply
something
for
us,
we
take
care
of
the
financial
requirements
there
by
an
agreement
to
amortize
the
cost
to
the
plant
but
we
will
not
enter
into
a
requirements
contract
because
the
requirements
contract
is
unlawful.
now
i
don't
believe
that
that
--
that
the
lack
of
necessity
of
the
requirements
contract
means
that
they
should
all
be
outlawed.
it
is
possible
that
there
are
requirements
contracts
which
do
not
run
afoul
of
the
qualifying
clause
that
is
to
say
that
in
the
sense
that
they
are
not
so
large
in
the
particular
circumstances
as
to
meet
the
standards
of
the
qualifying
clause.
on
the
whole,
i
would
say
that
requirements
contracts
are
an
instrument
and
by
their
nature
are
suspect
under
the
antitrust
law.
may
i
suggest
this,
mr.
justice?
i
know
that
this
court
has
said
--
has
said
some
harsh
things
about
tying
agreements
in
which
a
patented
product
is
tied
in
with
an
unpatented
and
so
on.
a
requirements
contract
actually
may
have
and
generally
does
have
a
much
more
serious
effect
on
competition
than
the
typical
tying
contracts.
let's
take
for
example,
international
salt
or
let's
take
the
signaled
steel
which
is
court
of
appeals
case.
it's
always
possible
in
a
tying
situation
for
a
--
for
the
dealer,
the
licensee
to
get
another
machine
from
somebody
else
or
i
don't
say
it's
always
possible
but
sometimes
possible,
get
a
machine
from
somebody
else
and
get
out
of
the
tying
contract
that
way
and
then
use
a
competitor's
supplies
for
--
for
the
competitor's
machine.
but
a
requirements
contract
is
total
complete
and
absolute
that
no
--
there's
no
way
of
getting
out
of
that.
you
can't
turn
through
a
competitor
but
--
so
i
wanted
--
want
just
one
sum
up
on
this.
number
one,
i
think
the
requirements
contracts
as
a
generality
are
--
have
to
be
highly
restrictive
on
the
trade.
they
have
to
lead
to
captive
situations
which
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
our
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
system
encourages.
number
two
--
mr.
abe
fortas
that
i
--
mr.
abe
fortas
no
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
no
sir,
i
do
not.
i
tried
to
introduce
what
i
said
mr.
justice
frankfurter
with
something
of
an
apology
because
i
know
that
this
court
has
said
that
--
has
indicated
that
the
tying
contracts
are
more
of
a
restrain
on
competition
than
the
requirements
contracts
and
that
was
merely
in
response
to
mr.
justice
harlan
stating
my
own
view
about
the
dangers
of
requirements
contracts.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
think
this
contract
is
so
extreme.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
the
--
everything
is
in
the
record.
it's
more
possibly,
yeah.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
this
contract
shows
for
example
the
volumes
involved
here
that
would
be
in
proscript
shows
the
number
of
prod
--
competing
--
competing
producers,
700
of
them.
it
shows
the
total
requirements
of
peninsular
florida.
it
shows
the
total
requirements
of
the
state
of
florida.
it
shows
the
--
by
reference
to
official
sources
only
does
it
show
the
total
consumption
of
both
the
state
of
florida
and
georgia.
mr.
justice,
i've
been
through
this
--
i've
been
around
these
bases.
if
this
case
went
back
on
these
considerations,
it
would
lead
to
the
employment
of
a
lot
of
experts
and
a
lot
of
statisticians
but
what
you
would
come
out
with
would
be
precisely
what
you
have
in
this
record
in
summary
form
and
you
have
it
in
this
record
because
both
parties
would
agree
that
the
facts
here
were
available
and
both
parties
agree
that
this
is
an
appropriate
case
for
a
summary
judgment.
neither
side
here
has
asked
as
was
true
in
some
of
the
other
cases
that
came
before
this
court,
neither
side
here
is
asked
that
--
has
objected.
mr.
abe
fortas
no
sir.
in
the
first
place,
that
would
be
exactly
contrary
to
law
as
set
down
by
this
court
and
in
the
second
place,
i
don't
believe
that
the
economic
reasons
here
make
any
difference
and
you
can
--
and
best
proof
of
that
is
a
substitute
contract
that
they
entered
into
and
the
fact
that
they
now
say
they're
going
to
build
another
one
about
ten
years
now.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
that
is
what?
mr.
abe
fortas
with
all
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
a
20-year
contract
then
it
has
--
it
involves
an
enormous
volume,
both
absolutely
and
relatively
that
this
record
does
show.
and
this
might
be
a
different
case.
it
might
be
a
very
difficult
case
if
those
two
facts
were
different.
may
i
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
doubts
--
doubt
it
but
i
hate
to
have
you
ask
me
about
a
one-year
contract
mr.
justice.
i'm
glad
you
didn't
bring
it
down
that
low
but
when
you
get
up
to
20-year
contract
or
10-year
contract,
i
personally
don't
have
any
doubt.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
was
afraid
you
have
that
in
mind.
that's
why
i
wanted
to
anticipate
you.
may
i
--
mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
need
not
repeat
what
this
court
has
said
and
that
is
to
say
that
there
is
a
--
an
absolute
standard
here
that
is
--
that
is
to
say
that
you
judge
the
size
of
the
restrain
on
an
absolute
basis.
i
believe
that
in
--
in
most
of
the
cases
if
not
all,
i
think
there's
been
some
sort
of
peripheral
look,
may
i
say,
at
what's
involved
here
but
i
think
that
the
important
thing
if
i
may
suggest
this,
mr.
justice,
the
important
thing
is
--
as
--
i
believe
the
cases
do
show.
section
3,
the
enforcement
of
section
3
must
not
be
entangled
in
a
sherman
act
market
concept
and
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
been
the
date
made
in
decisions
of
this
court.
now
--
mr.
abe
fortas
well
mr.
justice,
they're
all
objective
economic
phenomenon
and
of
course
it
is,
it's
a
question
of
size.
now
here
in
my
case
i'm
glad
to
say
in
my
opinion
anyway,
there's
not
enough
going
on
this
because
the
size
is
so
fantastic
and
the
length
of
the
contract
is
--
is
a
utterly
beyond
the
comprehension.
but
in
a
case,
i
can
visualize
a
case
in
which
a
--
a
sharp
question
might
be
presented
but
i
don't
believe
that
is
this.
mr.
chief
justice,
my
time
has
expired,
i
wanted
to
say
something
about
kelly
against
kosuga
but
--
mr.
abe
fortas
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
point
about
kelly
against
kosuga
is
this.
mr.
chanler,
the
principle
of
law
is
i
believe
mr.
justice
whittaker
recogni
--
stated
a
moment
ago
is
a
--
if
contract
is
unlawful,
it
is
void
and
will
not
be
enforced
by
the
court.
the
length
here,
this
is
an
unlawful
contract
merely
because
it
says
a
total
offer
for
the
seller
to
make
--
to
make
the
contract
doesn't
mean
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
it
would
be
an
unlawful
contract.
section
7
is
phrased
the
same
way.
section
2
of
the
--
of
the
sherman
act,
the
monopoly
section,
we
didn't
point
this
out
in
our
brief,
that's
framed
the
same
way
and
certainly
a
contract
to
monopolize
is
unlawful,
is
an
unlawful
contract.
kelly
against
kosuga
and
the
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court
recognize
this
principle
that
if
there
is
a
separable
transaction,
a
transaction
that
is
an
intelligible
economic
transaction
in
and
of
itself
and
that
is
--
and
which
is
not
part
of
the
unlawful
contract
that
may
be
enforced
by
the
court,
but
not
the
unlawful
contract
itself
and
that's
exactly
what
this
court
--
this
petitioner
is
asking
the
court
to
namely
to
enforce
the
unlawful
contract.
thank
you
very
much.
