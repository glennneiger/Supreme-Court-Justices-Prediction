justice

mr.
fortas,
you
seem
to
find
some
importance
in
the
provision
of
the
contract
of
another
coal
burning
facility
might
have
been
in
the
future
be
erected
by
standard
and
that
--
and
that
the
requirement
provision
would
be
tied
to
the
new
facility.
my
question
is
whether
that
the
record
shows
that
that
was
an
incipient
enterprise
or
that
was
also
just
another
that's
been
given
(inaudible)
provisions
in
the
contract.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
after
the
contract
had
been
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
i
want
to
know
is
at
the
time
of
the
making
of
the
contract
was
that
(inaudible)
contemplations
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
note?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
also
involved
typically
expenditures,
do
they
not?
i
mean
you
said
that
in
while
ago
that
to
turn
from
oil
to
coal
is
what
is
it,
three
million?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
install
new
plants
and
new
units
and
also
in
rather
to
make
figure
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
might
be
more
economical
if
you
have
no
units.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
what
i'm
saying,
the
one
might
be
more
economical
to
turn
the
use
of
oil
into
coal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
am
--
but
in
the
long
run
it
might
be
more
profitable
for
them.
i
don't
know
to
think
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
if
you
once
traveled
--
if
you
once
traveled
outside
the
terms
of
the
contract
that
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
he
have
certainly
things
are
written
into
contract
which
are
business
preferences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
it
in
terms
of
geography
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sure
your
coming
to
the
--
to
the
time
provision
but
you
have
repeatedly
put
particular
stress
on
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
in
due
you
will
deal
with
the
time
element.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
actually
my
mind
thinks
of
the
element
of
time
and
recipient
covenant
in
the
sale
of
businesses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
--
in
the
recipient
contract
--
covenant
cases,
the
sale
of
business
limiting
the
--
the
seller
to
non-engaging
in
that
business
for
x
years,
i
take
it
by
now
that
you
collect
an
indication
that's
clear
that
there's
absolute
limit
as
to
time.
the
time
must
be
a
function
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
requirements
and
therefore
in
due
course
i
hope
you
will
deal
with
the
relevance
of
20
years
to
this
kind
of
an
arrangement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean
when
you
certainly
reach
that
no
requirements
contract
would
be
valid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
we
have
to
(inaudible)
on
behalf
of
page
2,
questions,
what
were
the
--
any
kind
of
certain
requirements
under
(inaudible)
is
the
levin
ames
and
to
living
in,
what
the
relevance
or
the
ratio
of
relevance
of
the
duration
of
the
contract
during
which
assured
that
there
was
a
requiremnt?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
as
you
know,
we
don't
have
to
borrow
of
our
time.
if
no
such
agreement
--
every
such
agreement
offense
section
3
then
we
don't
have
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
then
if
we
start
at
some
length
and
then
you
do
have
to
face
the
reasonableness
in
relation
to
the
particular
unit
or
units,
the
particular
enterprise
in
relation
of
the
business,
if
justifiable
that
non
section
3
of
them
exhibit
interest
by
the
length
of
time
during
which
certain
requirements
are
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
--
can
we
do
that
just
out
of
the
clear
and
just
say,
well,
20
years
is
a
long
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
proviso,
soon
they
had,
mr.
fortas
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
win
the
(inaudible)
to
the
standard
argument
that
that
to
be
a
merely
suspect
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
really
suspect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
if
--
if
--
these
are
not
absolutes
mr.
fortas.
i
mean,
come
down
to
intended
(inaudible)
then
the
line
that's
drawn
is
drawn
with
reference
to
something.
it
isn't
drawn
with
reference
to
some
settled
dogma
(ph)
like
the
in
the
law
of
(inaudible)
for
security
in
reaching
an
insurer
security
to
change
the
general
contract
or
something
like
that
or
(inaudible).
it
gets
down
to
consideration
that
have
some
relevance
to
what
and
then,
that
comes
into
play
relevance
to
what
is
appropriately
fairly
protective
of
business
on
the
one
side
without
thereby
substantially
lessening
competition.
in
other
words,
you
are
roaming
over
into
mr.
justice
harlan's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
is
entangled
in
economic
reality
that
the
standard
or
the
case
itself
illustrates
objective,
external,
economic
phenomenon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
your
suggestion
might
be
made
mr.
chanler
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
federal
power
commission
granting
a
civic
and
a
leading
some
necessity
to
a
new
pipeline
to
be
built
unless
it
has
business
looking
ahead
for
20
years
as
against
a
plant
that
is
already
installed
for
coal
and
merely
securing
it's
supply.
