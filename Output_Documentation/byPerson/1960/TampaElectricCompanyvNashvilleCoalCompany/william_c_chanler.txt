mr.
william
c.
chanler
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
--
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
sixth
circuit
which
divided
court
affirmed
decision
of
the
district
court
and
the
middle
district
of
tennessee
holding
that
a
certain
contract
supply
part
of
the
requirements
coal
of
electric
utility
company
for
a
period
of
20
years
violated
the
clayton
act,
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
and
was
therefore
void.
the
case
arose
on
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
respondent
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts,
the
present
petition
of
the
plaintiff
although
of
course
moved
for
summary
judgement.
the
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
set
forth
in
full
at
page
2
of
my
brief,
so
far
as
pertinent
here,
if
your
honors
are
about
pretty
vague,
provisions
are
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
engaged
in
commerce
to
make
a
sale
or
contract
of
sale
or
to
fix
the
price
of
goods,
or
to
fix
the
price
charged
therefore
or
a
rebate
of
such
price
on
the
condition
agreement
or
understanding
that
the
lessee
office
thereof
shall
not
deal
in
the
goods
of
a
competitor
or
competitors
of
this
lessor
or
so.
then
follows
the
qualifying
clause
where
the
effect
of
such
lease,
sale
or
contract
to
sale
may
be
to
substantially
lesser
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce.
now
it's
our
contention
that
this
contract
it
has
to
bring
out,
it
doesn't
come
within
that
act
in
any
manner
at
all.
the
petitioner,
tampa
electric
company
is
a
regulated
electric
utility
operating
in
the
area
around
tampa,
florida
serving
3%
of
the
land
area
and
11%
of
the
population
of
the
state
of
florida.
the
respondents
mine
and
sell
coal
in
the
ohio
river
coal
areas
of
the
western
kentucky.
the
national
coal
company,
the
operating
company
which
is
assumed
this
contract
is
a
subsidiary
of
nashville
coal
inc.
which
it's
entirely
a
subsidiary
of
west
kentucky
coal
company.
the
background
of
contract
is
this.
well
1955,
well,
probably
1957,
tampa
produced
all
its
electricity
in
oil
burning
plants.
it
had
two
plants
on
tampa
bay,
focus
point,
(inaudible)
the
name
when
use
five
together
six
boilers
all
burning
coal.
it
is
a
fact
of
a
recent
meeting
(inaudible)
mr.
william
c.
chanler
burning
oil,
thank
you
sir.
it
is
a
fact
as
the
reason
to
brought
out
where
the
federal
power
commission
that
florida
as
a
fuel
have
not
state
and
until
very
recently,
would
monopolize
entirely
by
oil
which
it
could
most
conveniently
brought
--
be
brought
by
tampa
across
the
gulf
of
mexico.
in
1955,
the
management
of
tampa
got
in
touch
with
some
coal
merchants
finding
a
coal
producer
named
justin
potter,
potter
tolling
company
to
consider
the
possibility
of
introducing
coal
as
boiler
fuel,
in
florida
and
as
a
result,
this
contract
was
entered
into
on
may
23,
1955.
tampa,
the
petitioner
was
to
build
a
new
plant,
the
gannon
station
initially
with
two
coal
burning
units
ultimately
possibly
with
six
units
which
might
or
might
not
burn
coal.
potter
was
to
supply
the
requirements
coal
for
the
first
two
units
a
minimum
of
225,000
tons
a
year
for
a
period
of
20
years
at
a
price
fixed
in
the
contract,
and
in
addition,
he
was
to
supply
the
coal
for
any
additional
units
added
to
gannon
plant
during
the
first
10
years
of
the
contract
which
was
built
as
coal
burning
units.
tampa
was
free
after
the
first
two
units
to
construct
50
units
as
oil
burning
or
gas
burning
or
any
other
fuel
but
if
they
burnt
coal,
they
came
within
the
contract.
so
that
this
contract
covers
as
i
said
a
part
of
the
fuel
requirements
of
this
electric
utility
company.
in
1956,
potter's
contract
was
taken
over
by
national
coal
and
its
parent
west
kentucky.
the
deliveries
were
to
commence
in
the
spring
of
1957
after
some
discussion
as
to
whether
the
price
would
be
reduced.
finally
in
april
1957,
the
respondents
announced
that
they
would
not
perform
the
contract
because
they
contended
they
have
been
advised
by
counsel
that
it
violated
section
3
of
the
clayton
act.
we
then
brought
this
proceeding
for
declaratory
judgment.
none
of
these
--
none
of
the
facts
i
think
are
in
anyway
in
dispute.
the
basis
of
the
decision
below
was
that
the
contract
violated
the
act
because
it
embraced
the
total
requirements,
the
first
two
coal
burning
units
and
such
other
coal
burning
units
at
gannon
station
as
might
be
constructed
to
burn
coal
and
that
that
was
an
enormous
market
with
huge
quantity
of
coal.
now
your
honors,
i
think
are
familiar
with
the
purpose
of
section
c
of
the
clayton
act
that
disclosed
by
the
statutory
history,
an
act
of
1914
largely
because
at
that
time,
they
have
grown
up
throughout
the
country
the
practice
whereby
large
manufacturers
and
sellers
who
owned
or
control
some
particularly
desirable
article
of
commerce
sought
to
tie
up
the
resale
or
retail
outlet
for
their
goods
over
a
large
portion
of
the
country
as
they
could
by
selling
their
desirable
product
only
on
the
condition
that
the
purchaser
would
not
deal
with
their
competitors.
the
classic
example
was
the
international
shoe
company
which
possessed
the
patent
that
made
it
so
much
cheaper
to
manufacture
shoes
that
no
shoemaker
could
operate
unless
he
had
their
patent.
so
they
made
a
condition
that
they
wouldn't
license
anyone
to
use
their
patent
any
shoemaker
unless
he
also
ordered
leather
in
his
last
and
everything
else
that
he
could
use
in
making
shoes,
permitted
international
shoe.
and
as
the
senate
report
pointed
under
its
bill,
there
as
a
result,
was
impossible
drainage
more
shoemaker
anywhere
in
the
country
to
operate
unless
he
bought
everything
from
international
shoe,
they
have
the
fact
they
have
monopoly
across
that
contract
is
what
is
commonly
known
as
a
time
contract.
the
act
also
forbids
contracts
which
merely
require
that
the
purchaser
shall
buy
all
of
the
particular
type
of
goods
from
the
seller.
it
stand
as
examples
there
to
dress
fashion
cases,
standard
fashion,
fashion
designer's
guild
where
they
sold
these
specialized
fashion
--
dress
fashions
that
had
a
trade
name
and
a
value
only
on
condition
that
the
stores
use
them
--
showed
them
would
not
display
or
use
any
other
maker
patents
in
their
stores.
more
recent
case
of
that
type
of
exclusive-dealing
agreement
frequently
referred
to
as
the
requirements
contract
is
the
standard
oil
of
california
case
in
which
standard
oil
of
california
and
its
leading
competitors
sold
oil,
sold
gasoline
and
oil
to
filling
stations
in
the
western
seven
states,
western
area,
it
only
dealt
with
the
seven
states,
western
area
because
that
was
the
only
area
in
which
standard
operated
on
the
condition
that
the
filling
stations
would
not
sell
any
other
oil
but
standard's
or
if
its
competitors
--
of
its
competitors.
the
result
of
standard
tied
up
some
6,000
retailers
in
that
area
all
with
these
requirements
contracts.
now,
of
course
those
contracts
were
--
they
didn't
say
you
may
not
deal
with
our
competitors
like
the
fashion
one
contract
said
you
can't
sell
somebody
else's
fashion
but
this
merely
said
you
must
buy
all
your
gasoline
from
standard,
but
it
had
exactly
the
same
effect.
now,
there
was
where
the
type
of
contracts,
type
of
transactions
that
congress
was
directing
its
attention
to
when
it's
enacted
section
3
of
the
clayton
act.
and
it's
apparent
from
the
debates
of
congress
what
they
objected
to
was
a
powerful
manufacturer
with
leverage,
economic
leverage
grow
over
the
buyer,
compelling
the
buyer
if
he
wanted
to
deal
with
his
goods
at
all,
if
he
wanted
to
sell
standard
gasoline
to
just
buy
nothing
but
standard
gasoline
and
that
it
was
applicable
only
when
they
were
trying
to
tie
up
the
resale-retail
outlets
for
their
goods.
now,
if
you
examine
the
act
again
for
a
moment
on
page
2,
you'll
see
that
it
was
carefully
drawn
to
carry
out
just
that
type
of
a
prohibition.
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
make
a
sale
or
contract
of
sale
of
goods,
or
fix
a
price
or
a
rebate
on
such
price,
on
the
understanding
or
agreement
that
the
lessee
or
purchaser
shall
not
deal
in
the
goods
of
a
competitor
or
competitor
of
the
substance.
that's
the
language
you
would
use
if
you're
trying
to
say
you
can't
impose
an
exclusive
dealing
condition
on
the
buyer
as
a
condition
to
his
buying
your
product.
the
case
--
the
act
has
been
reviewed
some
19
cases
and
various
courts
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
eight
and
nine
i
think
in
this
court
and
in
everyone
of
those
cases,
a
powerful
seller
with
an
economic
leverage
due
either
to
a
patent
or
to
control
or
they
trade
name
(inaudible),
standard
gas,
standard
fashion,
and
so
forth,
imposed
conditions
to
exclusive
dealing
on
a
substantial
segment
of
the
resale
market
for
their
product.
as
i
said
6,000
retailers
in
the
western
area
in
standard,
60%
of
the
clothing
manufacturers
are
better
more
expensive
ladies
dresses,
in
standard
fashions,
and
so
forth.
in
every
case,
moreover,
the
contract
was
based
either
expressly
on
a
condition
that
the
purchaser
wouldn't
deal
with
the
seller's
competitors
or
was
of
the
type
of
requirements
contract
which
had
precisely
the
same
effect.
you
must
buy
all
your
requirements
from
us
or
not.
that
did
not
violate
the
act.
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
the
standard
oil
case,
a
dealer
who
has
entered
into
a
requirements
contact
with
standard,
that's
the
one
that
said
you
can't
buy
any
gas
from
anyone
else,
cannot
consistently
with
that
contract
sell
the
petroleum
products
of
a
competitor
of
standard
no
matter
how
many
pumps
he
has.
and
in
every
case,
the
stan
--
the
seller
had
this
economic
leverage
that's
pointed
out
and
in
every
case
it
tied
up
this
large
area
of
resale
outlets.
now,
it's
my
contention
also
in
every
case,
the
decree
of
the
court
was
directed
exclusively
against
the
seller.
it
was
the
seller
against
whom
the
act
was
directed,
the
act
of
it
was
saying
divulge
contract
to
be
in
that
merely
says
a
person
shall
not
make
a
sale
on
this
condition.
so
there
never
before
has
been
a
case
in
which
the
act
was
directed
against
anyone
but
the
seller
to
prevent
him
from
imposing
this
exclusive
dealing
condition.
now,
i
think
it's
fairly
apparent
that
the
act
we
have
here
before
is
--
it
doesn't
contain
anyone
of
the
four
criteria
which
this
court
has
relied
on
and
the
other
courts
have
relied
on,
and
which
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
adopted
the
act.
in
the
first
place,
because
it's
obvious,
this
contract
doesn't
contain
any
express
condition
that
the
purchaser
shall
not
deal
in
the
goods
of
the
seller's
patents.
it
merely
says
that
the
seller
will
sale
and
the
goods
that
were
purchased,
all
of
its
requirements
for
the
first
two
units
and
six
other
units
of
this
one
station
as
may
be
constructed
as
coal
burning
units
during
the
first
10
years
of
the
contract.
that
is
not
the
equivalent
of
the
type
of
exclusive
dealing
contract
that
said
you
can't
buy
anything
from
anybody
else.
proof
of
it
is,
we
are
now
purchasing
oil
--
merely
a
competitor
of
coal
and
boiler
fuel
in
11
oil
burning
units
on
tampa
bay
all
integrated
units
producing
electricity
on
the
same
wire
and
we
can
--
we
have
a
perfect
right
to
construct
additional
units
of
gannon
oil
burning
or
gas
burning
units,
thus
dealing
with
coal's
competitor
of
oil.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
under
the
contract.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
under
the
contract,
we
have
the
right.
that's
the
concept.
this
contract
doesn't
forbid
us
to
burn
all
the
oil
we
want
even
in
gannon
station
except
in
those
the
first
two
units
and
such
other
units
as
we
designate
this
coal
burning
--
so
it's
not
a
requirement,
full
requirement's
contract
at
all.
the
limited
possible
requirements
contract
limited
to
those
new
units
in
which
we
burn
the
coal.
actually,
for
that
reason
it
seems
to
me
it's
really
more
like
the
contract
for
a
fixed
amount
of
oil
--
of
coal.
because
everybody
knows
that
the
amount
of
coal
burned
in
the
particular
unit
can
be
told
within
5%
or
10%.
when
it's
constructed,
it's
usually
constructed
to
burn
so
many
tons
and
then
when
it
starts,
it
burns
a
little
more
or
a
little
less.
and
then
of
course
you
can't
tell
practically
how
much
demand
there
will
be
so
that
they
like
a
little
flexibility.
therefore,
they
make
it
a
requirement's
contract
but
it's
only
in
the
limited
requirements
of
this
one
--
these
two
original
units,
not
to
fill
the
third
coal
burning
unit,
but
as
i
say,
they
can
burn
oil
in
the
future
units
and
they're
now
burning
oil.
now
my
friend
says
and
the
court
below
held
that
oil
and
coal
are
separate
lines
of
commerce.
well,
i
point
out
that
the
basic
clause
of
the
clayton
act
doesn't
say
any
thing
about
line
of
commerce.
it
says,
"that
the
seller
may
not
deal
with
the
goods
of
the
seller
and
purchaser,
he
may
not
deal
in
the
goods
of
the
seller's
competitors.
coal
is
a
competitor
of
a
seller.
the
word
line
of
commerce
comes
in
only
in
the
qualifying
clause
and
i'll
come
to
that
later.
however,
let's
assume
that
coals
oil
are
separate
line
of
commerce.
we
can
burn
coal
in
any
of
the
oil
burning
units
that
we
are
--
where
we
are
now
burning
oil
and
although
of
my
friend
and
the
court
below
say
that
that's
a
very
unrealistic
approach,
the
record
shows
that
as
soon
as
we
began
operating
gannon
station,
the
first
unit
there
as
the
coal
burning
station
and
it
was
shown
that
coal
could
be
brought
down
the
ohio
river
by
barge
across
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
to
florida,
thereby
breaking
in
to
oil's
monopoly,
one
of
the
respondent's
principle
competitors,
the
peabody
coal
company
wrote
to
my
client
to
tampa,
and
formally
offered
to
supply
coal
for
two
of
the
oil
burning
units
who
then
were
burning
oil
on
tampa
bay
if
tampa
would
convert
those
units
to
coal.
thereupon,
--
first,
when
the
tampa
may
interrupt
with
his
oil
suppliers
and
they
reduced
their
price
of
oil.
that's
how
begins
the
competition,
this
type
of
contract
is.
coal
was
brought
in
to
florida,
the
price
of
oil
dropped.
now,
the
only
reason
we're
not
burning
coal
right
now
at
this
very
moment,
purchased
from
their
competitors
in
tampa
to
produce
our
electricity
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
restrictive
conditions
of
this
contract.
it
is
the
free
act
--
action
of
free
and
open
competition.
the
moment
peabody
coal
company
or
some
other
coal
company
can
offer
us
coal
at
a
price
that
is
competing
with
the
present
price
of
oil
and
oil
people
don't
reduce
their
price
any
further,
we
are
going
to
obviously
convert
and
buy
coal.
we
have
to
because
we
have
to
produce
electricity
at
the
cheapest
rate,
we
are
bound
to.
so
that
we
are
all
free
under
this
contract
to
buy,
burn
coal
and
buy
coal
from
their
competitors
right
now.
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
obviously
that
this
contract
doesn't
and
can't
come
within
the
basic
clause
of
the
clayton
--
of
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
because
it
doesn't
prevent
the
purchasers
from
dealing
in
the
goods
of
the
seller's
competitors
and
it's
no
use
to
say
that
the
courts
below
did
--
my
adversary
says
"oh
but
it
does
cover
a
very
large
quantity
of
coal
because
like
any
utility,
we
burn
a
lot
of
coal
to
produce
our
electricity"
ultimately
it
may
be
a
million
or
even
more
tons
a
year,
the
whole
thing
gets
going.
the
clayton
act
doesn't
forbid
a
contract
for
the
large
--
sale
of
a
large
number
of
goods,
large
quantity
of
goods.
it
only
forbids
the
contract
based
on
the
condition
that
the
buyer
won't
deal
in
the
goods
in
the
seller's
competitors
and
this
contract,
of
course,
doesn't
have
any
such
effect
at
all.
now
the
second
criteria,
also
the
statutory
history
and
decided
cases
which
i've
just
referred
in
determining
illegality
under
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
is
the
question
of
whether
the
seller
has
leverage,
economic
leverage
sufficient
to
impose
the
condition
on
the
purchaser.
the
importance
of
that
is
very
well
express
i
think
in
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
in
northern
pacific
railway
of
the
united
states
be
sure
that
dealt
with
the
tying
contract
when
it
came
up
under
the
sherman
act,
the
effect,
the
remarks
are
jointly
after
they
were
here.
in
discussing
this
issue
of
the
seller
having
economic
leverage
is
356
u.s.
at
page
6
and
7.
now
of
course
where
the
seller
has
no
control
or
dominance
over
the
tying
product
so
that
it
does
not
represent
in
the
factual
weapon
to
pressure
buyers
into
taking
the
tying
requirement,
any
restraint
of
trade
attribute
--
attributable
to
set
tying
arrangements
would
obviously
be
insignificant
at
most.
as
a
simple
example,
if
one
of
a
dozen
food
stores
in
the
community
where
they
refuse
to
sell
flour,
unless
the
buyer
took
sugar,
it
would
hardly
taint
to
restraint
competition
in
sugar
if
its
competitors
were
ready
and
able
to
sell
flour
by
itself.
now,
the
same
would
be
true
if
he
said
"i
won't
sell
you
any
flour
unless
you
ready
buy
all
of
your
flour
from
me”
and
the
other
stores
say
"oh
we'll
sell
whatever
flour
you
ask
for.
now,
it's
conceded
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
were
700
coal
dealers
in
the
appalachian
coal
fields
in
ohio,
west
virginia
and
all
around
there
who
were
ready,
willing
and
even
eager,
as
it
does
to
sell
us
coal.
west
kentucky
or
potter
towing
company
with
whom
we
made
the
contract
have
invested
the
slightest
economic
leverage
to
compel
us
--
to
deal
with
them
at
all
or
to
compel
us
to
say
"if
we
deal
with
you,
we
don't
deal
with
anybody
else".
the
only
reason
this
contract
was
made
as
a
requirement's
contract
--
it's
perfectly
well
understandable
business
reason
which
mr.
justice
harlan
called
attention
to
in
the
mobil
case
seven
years
ago
that
when
you
are
converting
from
one
fuel
to
another,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
long-term
requirements
contract
to
make
it
economically
feasible
to
invest
large
sums
necessary
to
construct
plant
and
in
that
case
was
also
related
to
conversion.
the
record
shows
that
it
cost
us
$3
million
more
to
build
the
gannon
plant
as
a
coal
burning
plant
than
it
would
have
if
we
built
an
oil
burning
plant.
the
record
shows
also
that
these
respondents
had
to
invest
upwards
of
$7.5
million,
i
believe
it's
--
i'm
told
now
it's
$9
million
in
building
barges
to
come
down
the
ohio
river
and
the
mississippi
river
building
especial
docks
in
new
orleans
to
unload
the
coal
from
the
barges
and
put
it
on
the
steamer
that
can
cross
the
gulf
and
take
it
to
tampa
and
unloading
facilities
on
tampa's
dock.
now,
nobody's
going
to
go
into
those
that
type
of
a
long
term
investment
and
then
say
"well,
now
i
want
to
go
out
and
see
where
i
want
to
get
my
coal.
everyday
i
look
at
the
market
and
buy
sometimes
from
this
man
and
sometimes
from
that."
the
only
way
anybody
can
justify
that
kind
of
an
operation
is
to
enter
into
a
contract,
the
firm
agreement
that
would
supply
all
the
coal
that
you
need
to
burn
in
that
plant
or
at
least
to
long
enough
periods
to
amortize
the
cost
of
the
plant.
actually,
while
this
litigation
is
going
on
in
houston
pipeline
company,
i
think
it
is
where
the
federal
power
commission
requested
the
right
to
put
a
pipeline
into
western
florida
or
eastern
florida,
it
won't
reach
us
on
the
other
coast,
the
eastern
coast.
and
the
federal
power
commission
said,
"well,
you
can't
do
that
unless
you"
enter
into
20
year
requirements
contract
with
utilities
on
the
eastern
coast
so
that
you're
sure
to
have
somebody
to
buy
the
gas
otherwise,
it's
not
economically
feasible.
that's
why
we
entered
into
this
contract
and
not
in
any
way
because
of
any
pressure
the
seller
could
have
put
on
us,
because
they
tell
us
that
the
buyer
had
the
pressure.
they
say
that
ohio
--
would
say,
"oh
yes,
it
was
tampa
who
insisted
on
the
requirements.
well,
maybe
we
did.”
certainly
we
wouldn't
build
the
contract
unless
we
would
build
the
plant,
unless
we
were
sure
of
our
requirements.
section
c
of
the
clayton
act
doesn't
say
that
it's
wrong
for
a
buyer
to
go
out
and
say
"i
want
you
to
supply
my
requirements"
and
your
honor
pointed
out
in
standard
oil
that
a
buyer
always
had
the
right
to
do
that.
so
that
clearly
this
contract
doesn't
come
within
the
objection
that
the
seller
had
any
economic
leverage.
the
significance
of
it
is
as
i
said
that
where
there
is
no
such
leverage
there
is
no
real
attempt
to
monopolize
or
limit
competition.
it
isn't
that
kind
of
transaction.
this
isn't
the
transaction
that
congress
was
talking
about
when
the
act
was
adopted.
third,
this
is
just
a
single
contract
by
a
single
consumer
for
its
raw
materials
from
a
single
buy.
it's
the
first
time
the
act
has
ever
been
applied
or
anyone
has
attempted
to
apply
the
act
to
that
type
of
contract.
hitherto
it
is
always
been
a
situation
as
i've
said
where
the
seller
is
trying
to
tie
up
all
the
outlets
in
the
country,
the
market.
the
market
is
a
place
where
a
lot
of
people
get
together
and
buy.
they
refer
repeatedly
to
this
huge
market
represented
by
the
gannon
station
at
tampa.
well,
that's
the
electric
light
–
electric
producing
sale.
they
don't
buy
or
sell
coal
there.
they
make
electricity
and
it's
not
a
market.
now,
it
is
true
as
they
point
out
that
the
act
speaks
of
a
contract
for
use
or
consumption.
the
reason
the
act
used
a
singular
aid
when
congress
was
talking
about
this
--
this
practice
of
making
a
lot
of
contracts
was
in
part,
you
might
for
instance
tie
up
one
contract
with
sears
and
roebuck
or
the
a
and
b
company
which
you
tie
up
all
the
outlets
of
that
big
company
in
the
entire
country.
secondly,
that
the
act
provided
that
it
could
be
enforced
by
a
single
purchaser
who
said,
"i
am
being
discriminated
against
them"
and
because
there
are
number
of
cases
where
a
single
purchaser
came
in,
went
to
court
said,
“i'm
being
penalized
by
this
condition
that
the
seller
imposed
on
me
and
i
don't
want
to
live
up
with
it
and
the
court,
this
court
has
held
he
doesn't
have
to
where
the
seller
imposes
an
exclusive
dealing
condition
in
this
manner.
consumption,
of
course
had
to
be
covered
as
well
as
resale
because
--
take
the
united
shoe
company.
they
were
consuming
leather
and
so
forth
in
making
shoes
with
this
machine
and
the
manufacturing
process,
the
same
situation
arises
but
the
real
reason
--
and
so
that
language
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
it
certainly
there's
no
reason
because
they
used
the
word
"a
contract
for
consumption".
they
suddenly
turn
around
and
say
"we
therefore
can
apply
it
to
a
type
of
contract
and
normal
business
transaction
whereby
the
careful
producer
of
electricity
arranges
for
its
supplies,
a
raw
product
which
was
never
contemplated
by
congress
and
never
before
passed
on
by
court.
now,
why
do
i
say
that
it
is
wrong
there
to
apply?
i
think
the
reason
is
that
there
is
no
basis
in
its
contract
at
this
kind
for
inferring
that
the
contract
is
all
could
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
competition.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
standard
oil,
one
of
the
great
questions
was
to
find
out
what
tests
were
necessary
from
which
the
inference
could
be
drawn
that
the
contract
where
or
could
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
limiting
competition.
he
discarded
there
the
test
to
prove
him
whether
or
not
it
in
fact
limited
competition
and
so
forth.
but
there
to
sound,
to
hit
that
the
cause
standard
tied
up
6,000
retail
outlets
a
substantial
part
of
the
gasoline
filling
stations
in
that
area
and
because
the
amount
of
gasoline
sold
was
substantial
and
the
substantial
segment
of
the
market,
it
could
be
inferred
there
that
those
contracts
had
the
effect
of
limiting
competition.
i'm
talking
now
of
course
of
the
qualifying
clause,
the
contract
must
be
shown
to
limit
the
competition
or
tend
to
cause
monopoly
but
i
don't
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
was
pointing
out
just
before
the
recess,
one
of
my
contentions
is
that
a
single
contract
whereby
a
single
consumer
arranges
for
the
supply
of
its
requirements
of
raw
material
over
a
period
of
years,
cannot
come
within
section
3
of
the
clayton
act
because
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
under
such
a
contract
that
the
effect
or
purpose
or
use
of
the
contract
shall
in
any
way
be
to
limit
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly.
it
stands
on
a
totally
different
footing
than
a
contract
tying
up
large
section
of
actual
retail
or
consuming
market.
the
reason
for
that
–
it's
perfectly
true
that
large
volume
of
coal
is
withdrawn
from
competition,
i'll
put
it
that
way,
and
that,
of
course,
is
their
point,
but
quantitative
test
alone
is
not
enough.
in
the
first
place,
you
have
to
show
that
somehow
it
tends
to
join
some
connection
with
illegal
method
of
limiting
competition
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
stated
long
ago
in
board
of
trade
v.
chicago
quoted
at
page
19
of
my
brief.
every
agreement
concerning
trade,
every
regulation
of
trade
restraints
from
buying
to
restrain
is
of
the
very
essence.
obviously,
the
contract
to
buy
225,000
or
2
million
tons
of
coal
a
year
has
effect
or
preventing
the
purchaser
from
buying
that
coal
from
anybody
else,
or
from
many
other
sellers,
for
selling
that
coal
to
the
purchaser
but
there's
nothing
illegal
about
that
type
of
contract,
if
there
was,
every
contract
in
which
you
buy
a
large
volume
of
goods
would
be
illegal.
there
must
be
some
connection
between
the
volume,
the
quantity
and
restraint
in
the
competition
and
that
in
terms
of
the
clayton
act
as
hitherto
construed
by
the
courts
and
as
intended
by
congress
occurs
only
in
this
type
of
contract
when
the
effect
is
to
tie
up
competition
for
the
resale
or
the
tying
up
of
outlets
of
the
sellers
goods.
moreover,
as
mr.
judge
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
standard
oil,
purely
--
a
purely
quantitative
measure
of
the
effect
of
the
contract
is
inadequate
because
the
narrower
the
area
of
competition,
the
greater
the
competitive
effect
on
the
areas
of
competitors.
since
it
is
the
preservation
of
competition
which
is
at
stake,
the
significant
proportion
is
that
of
the
area
of
effective
competition.
now
my
friends,
talk
about
the
area
of
fixed
competition
as
being
in
florida
and
i
say
why,
we're
selling
half
the
coal
that's
being
burned
in
florida.
we
may
sell
more
than
half
the
coal.
well,
that's
because
we're
the
first
ones
to
burn
fuel
coal
as
a
fuel
in
florida.
we
are
the
newcomers
in
the
field.
we
are
now
contemplating
building
an
atomic
power
plant
in
florida.
when
that's
built,
we
have
100%
of
the
atomic
power
plant
market
for
florida,
that
won't
be
a
monopoly.
we'll
be
introducing
a
new
competitive
fuel
as
--
a
method
of
making
electricity
so
that
the
fact
that
we
have
--
selling
a
large
proportion
of
the
coal
being
burned
and
sold
in
florida
is
just
prickly
beside
the
point,
what
we've
done
is
to
open
up,
to
the
sellers'
competitors.
the
entire
boiler
fuel
market
and
fuel
market
in
general
is
the
whole
peninsula
of
florida
which
has
to
do
with
monopolizing
entirely
by
oil.
the
sellers'
competitors
can
vote
anybody
who
is
buying
oil
and
say
"look,
we
can
bring
coal
in
the
way
they're
doing
it
in
tampa,
will
you
deal
with
us,"
something
that
nobody
that
would
thought
of
doing
before,
but
the
real
market
here
is
the
market
in
which
the
competitors
and
their
sellers
and
their
competitive
seller
and
their
competitors
market
their
coal
and
the
market
from
which
our
competitors
in
florida
could
buy
their
coal
in
that
market.
this
contract
shows
--
is
up
in
the
--
the
coal,
it
can
be
sold
from
coal
mines
located
up
in
the
head
waters
of
ohio
river
and
the
center
or
eastern
part
of
the
country,
and
that
market
extends
at
least
from
the
rocky
mountains
to
the
atlantic
coast
if
not
beyond.
actually,
this
contract
involves
quantitatively
1%,
less
considerably
less
than
1%.
even
if
we
had
six
units
--
we
only
have
three,
all
burning
coal
to
maximum,
it
would
involve
much
less
than
1%
of
all
the
coal
marketed
by
this
seller,
this
respondent
and
its
competitors
in
the
area
where
they
market
--
from
which
they
market
coal,
where
they
dig
coal
and
which
they
sell
it.
if
you
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
i
think
--
i
think
it's
coal
all
of
their
coal
causes
this
boiler
fuel.
i
don't
know
enough
about
the
coal
--
i
don't
know
the
--
we've
been
talking
about
exercise
if
that's
what
your
honor
means.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
think
i'll
figure
(inaudible)
i
suppose
and
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well,
i
yes.
i
think
that
it's
broken
up
in
different
sizes
depending
on
what
you're
going
to
use
it
for
and
that
coal
is
so
forth.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
don't
know
but
i
understand
the
figures
we
got
from
some
government
(inaudible)
it's
on
our
brief.
it
is
less
1%
of
the
coal
which
they
do
sell
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
--
from
that
area
and
if
you
recognize
that
the
market
is
the
boiler
fuel
market,
it
seems
to
me
it's
really
is.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well,
i
said
it
was
the
area
in
which
peabody
coal
company,
west
kentucky
coal
company
and
all
its
competitors
along
the
ohio
river
and
west
of
virginia
sell
their
coal
and
they
sell
their
coal
as
i
understand
it
form
the
east
of
the
rocky
mountains
along
the
--
end
of
high
plains
all
the
way
over
to
the
atlantic
coast.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh,
west
virginia
is
in
the
same.
well
i
don't
--
i'm
not
drawing
a
distinction,
i
mean
the
central
appalachian
of
coal
fields
which
is
west
virginia,
ohio,
tennessee,
kentucky,
it's
all
in
together
now.
i
wasn't
trying
to
do
a
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
what's
that?
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes.
oh
yes.
it's
that
whole
area
because
as
we
see
it
from
anyone
of
those
coal
producers,
you
can
buy
coal
and
have
it
shipped
either
to
florida
or
maine
or
colorado
and
therefore
that
is
the
market
that
we're
talking
about.
florida
is
even
the
market
until
this
contract.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i'm
surprised
to
introduce
to
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i'm
surprised
that
it
is
much
1%
and
i
don't
--
i
didn't
really
check
where
they
cut
the
figures
and
gave
to
me.
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
much
less
because
of
the
enormous
quantities
of
coal.
it
may
be
just
boiler
of
coal.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
of
coal.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
done.
yes.
and
we
only
have
two
minutes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
i
think
it
must
be
discounted
coal.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
and
of
course
in
the
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well,
i'm
limiting
it
to
the
productive
area
in
the
appalachian
mountains
including
west
virginia
and
ohio.
i
think
that's
all
included
in
this
figure
because
that
is
the
area
as
i
see
it
which
from
which
coal
moves
out
by
rail
or
water
in
any
--
in
all
directions.
they
could
bring
the
coal
in
west
virginia
down
to
the
coast
and
down
to
florida
and
atlantic
coast
or
down
the
ohio
or
florida,
either
one
or
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
and
when
you
measure
these
little
utility's
requirements
in
terms
of
the
fuel,
boiler
fuel
market
that
these
coal
producers
can
reach
including
oil
burners
of
oil
and
gas,
of
course
it
becomes
even
more
infinite
testimonial
through
this.
that's
what
it
is
(inaudible).
in
other
words,
my
contention
here
is
that
you
can't
diffuse
one
of
700
coal
dealers
of
attempting
to
limit
competition
or
attempt
to
create
a
monopoly
in
coal.
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
even
though
the
producer
is
trying
to
accuse
himself,
establish
that
monopoly,
but
it
just
doesn't
make
sense.
as
judge
white
said
in
his
dissent
below,
"i
cannot
consider
a
single
contract
with
a
single
utility
serving
only
3%
of
the
land
area
and
11%
of
the
population
of
a
single
state
as
“substantially
lessening
competitions
or
tending
to
create
a
monopoly"
and
i
think
that
disposes
of
that
angle
of
my
case.
now,
i'd
like
--
just
one
more
point
and
i
said,
in
none
of
the
cases,
none
of
the
19
cases
that
--
except
one,
the
20th
case
boeing
company,
i'll
come
to
it
in
a
moment,
none
of
the
prior
cases
before
a
year
ago
had
a
seller
even
attempting
to
get
out
of
this
contract
on
the
ground
that
he
had
entered
into
a
sale
on
the
condition
that
the
purchaser
wouldn't
deal
with
its
competitors.
in
other
words,
the
seller
had
violated
the
act.
every
prior
case,
well,
three
quarters
of
them
were
cases
brought
by
the
federal
trade
commission
which
tried
to
stop
the
seller
from
enforcing
an
exclusive
dealing
condition
on
the
ground
that
the
inclusive
dealing
condition
violated
the
act,
tended
to
limit
the
competition
and
was
unfair
to
the
purchasers.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
repeated
over
and
over
and
the
congressional
record
is
that
the
purpose
was
to
protect
the
little
dealers
throughout
the
country
who
weren't
allowed
to
sell
more
than
one
brand
of
goods
on
there,
in
their
stores
by
virtue
of
these
requirements
contracts.
the
act,
as
i
have
said,
contains
no
provision
outlawing
contracts
at
all
and
as
--
thrown
a
stone
these
recent
cases.
kelley
v.
kosuga
was
pointed
out
and
many
other
cases,
the
court
will
not
impose
in
party
provision
outlawing
contracts
into
a
prohibitory
or
penal
statue
when
congress
didn't
put
it
there.
the
only
time
you
hold
the
contract
unlawful
because
of
a
violation
asserts
contract
is
when
such
a
statute
is
when
the
illegal
act
is
inherent
in
the
contract
itself
or
when
the
seller,
the
wrong
doer
is
trying
to
profit
by
his
own
wrong,
for
the
wrong
do
--
as
a
seller.
he
is
trying
a
profit
by
his
own
wrong
here
by
getting
out
of
a
legitimate
contract.
if
he
was
trying
to
enforce
the
contract
and
had
violated
the
act,
we
could
prevent
it
from
doing
a
pursuit
with
the
trade
commission
perhaps.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
requirement.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
i
think
mostly
we've
been
buying
year
by
year
because
we
never
knew
--
for
a
long
time,
we
didn't
know
whether
these
people
were
going
to
begin
supplying
us
again.
so
at
first,
we
bought
on
short
term.
now,
i
think
we
have
a
fairly
long-term
contract.
i
think
it
should
be
difficult
of
this.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh
yes.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
dollar
or
dime.
at
least
it
can
be
a
dollar
or
a
dime.
i
think
they've
got
it
readily
down
closer
now,
but
i
think
during
the
first
year
they
say
they
had
to
pay,
when
they
quit,
they
had
to
pay
a
dollar
or
more,
that's
why
they
didn't
want
to
sell
it.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
yes,
that's
right.
yes.
yes,
we
didn't
bring
an
action
for
damages
because
it
was
an
anticipatory
breach.
we
didn't
know
what
we
have
to
pay
for
coal
so
we
wanted
to
establish
what
we
were
entitled
to,
but
we've
got
first
cancel
claim,
i
thought
we
had
to
keep
--
we've
been
under
a
duty
as
a
public
utility
to
keep
the
plant
running
and
we
have
to
scatter
around
and
get
the
best
coal
we
could
find
as
quickly
as
we
could
to
keep
the
plant
running
and
produce
electricity.
now
as
i
said,
the
only
--
there
is
only
one
case
that
i
know
of
in
which
a
seller
has
attempted
to
get
out
of
a
requirements
contract
and
that
was
the
true
one
with
a
real
(inaudible)
condition
on
the
ground
that
he
violated
the
act
that
is
in
the
case
of
(inaudible).
there,
there
had
been
a
contract
that
you
couldn't
buy,
use
for
special
salt
water
softening
device
unless
you
bought
all
the
water
softening
device
from
the
same
seller.
federal
trade
commission
stepped
in
and
issued
an
order
enjoining
the
seller
from
enforcing
the
contract.
the
seller
then
refused
to
continue
to
sell
to
the
buyer.
the
buyer
brought
a
proceeding
gets
as
we
did
for
declaratory
judgment
that
the
contract
was
enforceable
by
him.
judge
igo
in
the
district
court
said
that
he
was
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed,
pointing
out
that
the
act
is
designed
to
protect
purchasers
against
sellers
and
could
not
be
turned
around
to
commit
a
seller
try
and
get
out
of
his
contract
by
saying
he
has
violated
the
act
when
the
purchaser
was
anxious
to
have
it
performed.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
no,
sir
not
necessarily.
it
tends
whether
the
--
if
the
statute
says
that
any
such
contract
shall
be
void,
can
be
void,
of
course,
but
if
the
statute
says
no
person
shall
impose
this,
as
i
construed
this
section
3,
what
in
effect
says
no
person
shall
impose
an
exclusive
dealing
condition
on
a
contract
of
sale.
that
means
no
seller
may
impose
condition.
when
the
act
was
originally
drawn,
sir,
it
was
criminal
statute
directed
solely
against
the
substance.
any
person
who
shall
make
a
contract
of
sale
on
the
condition
that
the
purchaser
will
not
deal
with
the
sellers'
competitors
will
be
guilty
of
a
crime
of
misdemeanor.
for
senate,
that
was
the
house
burden.
the
senate
didn't
like
it,
it
was
too
harsh.
they
had
a
very
much
louder
bill.
in
conference,
the
bill
was
the
criminal
sanction
was
taken
out
and
the
qualifying
clause
softening
its
effect
was
added
where
the
effect
of
such
condition
might
be
to
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
monopoly.
but
the
major
portion
of
the
act
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
to
make
sale
on
this
condition
remains
substantially
the
same.
a
thing
that
has
drawn
when
the
seller
was
guilty
of
a
crime,
that
totally
was
directed
towards
the
seller
and
the
fact
that
the
seller
has
committed
that
crime
did
not
mean
that
the
contract
which
he
had
illegally
made
was
void,
voidable
by
him
as
against
the
purchaser,
the
innocent
party
for
whom
benefit,
the
law
was
passed.
and
that's
what
the
court
has
held
in
the
only
case
before
this
one
where
an
attempt
by
a
seller
to
take
advantage
of
this
alleged
wrong
doing
has
been
testified.
i
don't
believe
that
the
seller
in
the
(inaudible)
case,
petitioned
this
court
fortiori
so
that
i
went
no
further
than
the
seventh
circuit
but
i
maintain
sir,
that
the
contract
of
this
kind
--
like
many
contracts
where
many
particularly
contracts
in
this
very
field
of
antitrust
statutes,
sherman
act,
there
are
contracts
of
which
where
there
have
been
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
well,
in
kelly
against
kosuga
and
(inaudible),
there
had
been
violations
of
the
sherman
act
but
the
violations
were
not
of
section
2
which
declares
contracts
unlawful
under
section
1.
and
this
court
said,
“well,
that
doesn't
declare
the
contract
unlawful
and
therefore
the
contract
still
impossible
unless
the
wrong
doer
is
trying
to
benefit
by
his
own
wrong
or
where
as
in
the
connelly
(inaudible)
case
i
think
it
was,
where
enforcement
of
the
contract
would
require
the
court
to
sanction,
the
performance
of
the
unlawful
act.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
well
in
--
in
kelly
against
kosuga,
there
was
a
breach
of
contract
and
the
seller
sued
for
the
contract
price
as
i
remember,
damages
between
what
he
resell,
the
good
ads
to
the
public
and
the
contract
price.
he
tended
to
gauge
if
the
buyer
wouldn't
take
them.
he
sold
them
on
the
market
sued
for
the
difference
and
this
court
held
that
he
was
entitled
to
recover
even
though
that
was
the
--
even
though
he
had
--
even
though
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
act.
it's
only
i
think
sir,
if
you
could
say
that
section
3
forbids
the
performance
of
a
contract
which
has
a
--
an
exclusive
dealing
conditions
in
its
buy
for
purchaser
that
this
contract
would
be
void,
but
the
act
doesn't
say
that.
there's
only
that
the
seller
may
not
impose
the
condition.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
this
is
the
type
of
case
where
the
seller
himself
cannot
avoid
his
factual
obligations
by
pretending
that
he
has
violated
that
act.
i
like
to
preserve
the
--
mr.
william
c.
chanler
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
remind
your
honors
and
we
seem
to
gotten
rather
far
away
from
it
in
the
discussion
that
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
section
c
of
the
clayton
act
or
the
statutory
history
for
that
matter
that
refers
to
requirements
contracts
at
all.
the
question
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
not
whether
somebody
can
call
it
as
a
requirements
contract
because
we
have
agreed
to
purchase
a
part
and
that's
not
a
slip
of
the
tongue,
i
mean
a
part
of
our
fuel
requirements
from
one
seller.
the
question
is
whether
this
is
a
contract
to
sell
coal
on
the
condition
that
the
purchaser
shall
not
use
or
deal
in
the
goods
of
the
seller's
competitors.
now
mr.
fortas
said
“oh
but
we're
not
actually
buying
coal
from
anybody
else.”
he
admits
the
contract
permits
us
to
buy
coal
when
peabody
coal
company
made
us
a
written
offer
to
sell
us
coal
to
burn
in
our
other
plants
if
the
oil
company
hasn't
reduced
their
price,
we
deposit.
we
were
dealing
with
the
seller's
competitors
when
we
were
negotiating
with
peabody.
you
cannot
convert
this
contract
into
a
contract
upon
the
condition
that
the
purchaser
will
not
deal
and
goes
to
the
seller's
competitors
by
saying
that
it
still
happens
for
economic
reasons
that
we
haven't
availed
ourselves
of
our
legal
right
to
do
so
whenever
any
coal
company
comes
and
offers
us
coal
at
a
competitive
price
with
oil,
we
are
free
to
deal
with
them,
we
intend
to
deal
with
them.
now
this
word
requirements
contracts
with
all
due
respect
isn't
even
mentioned
as
far
as
i
know
in
any
case
by
the
standard
oil
case
and
it
isn't
mentioned
as
far
as
i'm
aware
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history.
they
don't
know
about
exclusive
dealing
contracts,
contracts
based
upon
the
condition
imposed
on
the
purchaser
that
he
would
not
deal
with
the
seller's
competitors.
the
word
requirements
contract
were
viewed
first
in
standard
because
their
--
that
contract,
that
exclusive
dealing
contract,
that
contract
based
on
the
condition
that
the
filling
stations
in
those
filling
stations
wouldn't
deal
with
the
seller's
competitors
was
passed
in
terms
of
requirements.
contract
said
filling
station
x
will
buy
all
its
gasoline
requirements
from
standard
and
standard
will
fulfill
all
his
gasoline
requirements.
but
the
purpose
and
effect
of
that
contract
was
exactly
the
same
as
the
kind
that
the
act
was
directed
at
and
that
congress
was
intended
to
attack.
it
was
as
if
they
said
nobody
can
sell
standard
gas
in
any
filling
station
anywhere
in
the
country
if
they
sell
anybody
else's
gas
in
that
station.
that's
why
it
was
standard.
the
requirements
contract
violated
both
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
letter
and
spirit
of
the
act.
the
contract
that
we
have
here
has
none
of
that
thing
whatever.
it
is
simply
a
contract
whereby
a
consumer
purchases
his
raw
requirements
that
he
needs
in
his
business
in
order
to
enable
him
first
to
justify
the
capital
expenditure
of
building
a
coal
burning
plant
which
will
take
20
years
to
amortize
and
to
fulfill
his
public
utility
duties
of
producing
power
at
the
cheapest
rate
and
having
continuity
over
the
years
so
that
he
won't
have
to
be
changing
his
rate
all
the
time.
as
your
honor,
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
mobile
--
united
gas
v.
mobile,
350
us
332
in
page
48
of
my
brief,
conversion
by
consumers
particularly
industrial
users
to
the
use
there
of
natural
gas
may
frequently
require
substantial
investments
which
the
consumer
and
thus
will
be
unwilling
to
make
without
long-term
commitments
from
the
distributor
and
the
distributor
can
hardly
make
such
commitments
if
it's
supply
contract
(inaudible)
chain
because
that
was
the
clayton
act
case
but
the
economic
proposition
laid
down
there
is
exactly
the
same
one
we
have
here.
we
couldn't
have
built
this
plant
and
brought
coal
in,
in
any
other
way.
now
i
would
like
also
to
point
out
on
this
question
of
the
market
because
your
honor,
chief
justice,
put
your
finger
right
on
it
when
you
talked
about
the
situation
of
california.
if
a
utility
company
in
california,
large
or
small
suddenly
decided
that
it
could
be
economical
to
bring
coal
into
california
so
they
start
a
coal
burning
utility
plant
in
california.
it
would
have
a
monopoly
according
to
them
because
it
would
be
burning
all
the
coal
being
burned
at
least
for
boiler
fuel
in
california.
it
would
of
course
be
absurd
to
measure
the
market
that
was
said
to
be
embraced
by
the
contract
of
supply,
whatever
contract
they
made
on
the
basis
of
that
use
to
coal
as
a
new
comer
in
the
states.
i
might
add
of
course
your
honor,
regularly
doesn't
visualize
that
it
would
be
very
improvident
probably
the
california
utility
commission
for
vehicle,
a
utility
company
to
go
into
expense
building
a
large
electricity
light
producing
plants
in
california
that
was
going
to
burn
oil
unless
they
had
a
good
contract,
a
long-term
contract
to
supply
if
they're
going
to
burn
coal
that
would
supply
coal
long
enough
to
make
it
economically
feasible
for
them
to
have
a
coal
plant
there
because
that's
what
the
federal
power
commission
made
them
do
in
burning
gas
in
florida.
they
can't
bring
gas
into
florida
with
the
great
expense
of
building
a
pipeline
unless
they
have
a
20-year
requirements
contract
to
make
it
economically
feasible.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
this
contract
was
made
at
the
time
the
plants
for
the
coal
plant
was
still
on
the
drawing
board
sir.
before
we
started
to
build
our
plant,
just
as
before
they
began
building
the
pipeline,
we
made
our
contract
for
the
coal
supplier.
we
wouldn't
have
built
a
coal
burning
plant
if
we
hadn't
had
this
contract.
we
couldn't
have
dared.
mr.
william
c.
chanler
oh
yes,
the
contract
was
made
in
1956
and
the
plant
was
completed
in
1958
--
1957.
i
think
that's
all
it
is.
and
in
regard
to
the
record,
mr.
justice
harlan,
there
are
quite
complete
affidavits
on
which
these
motions
were
made.
it's
set
forth
all
pertinent
facts
as
to
why
the
contract
was
made,
the
circumstances
under
which
it
was
made
and
everything
i
think
which
are
found
in
the
record.
the
facts
to
a
statement
of
the
court
below
are
quite
specific
as
to
the
economic
purposes
and
so
called.
now
mr.
fortas
has
stated
that
this
court,
well
his
argument
has
been
all
the
time
that
all
you
have
to
show
assuming
that
you
--
he
can
show,
and
i
don
think
he
can
that
this
is
a
condition
--
a
contract
on
the
condition,
that
the
seller
won't
buy
or
won't
deal
from
the
goods
of
the
seller's
competitors
assuming
that
he
causes
that
hurdle,
that
all
he
has
to
show
is
that
the
amount
involved
is
large
in
terms
of
quantity.
and
i
would
like
to
remind
your
honors
that
in
the
standard
oil
case,
justice
frankfurter
stated
in
so
many
words,
a
purely
quantitative
measure
of
the
effect
of
the
contract
is
inadequate
because
the
narrower
the
area
of
competition,
the
greater
the
comparative
effect
on
the
area's
competitors.
this
question
of
quantity
they
talk
about
even
if
it
were
reasonable
to
talk
about
to
coal
of
a
single
really
small
size
utility
as
an
enormous
quantity
of
itself
doesn't
prove
anything
here.
it
certainly
doesn't
prove
that
we
come
within
main
clause
of
the
contract
as
the
court
below
felt.
the
court
below
felt
said
this
was
a
contract
in
violation
of
the
main
clause
of
the
clayton
act.
in
other
words,
the
contract
not
to
deal
with
the
seller's
competitors
because
it
embraced
a
huge
amount
of
coal,
but
you
can't
say
that
its
contract
not
to
deal
with
the
seller's
competitors
because
the
amount
involved
is
large
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
under
the
court
below
decision
if
that
were
the
law
and
if
that
should
be
affirmed,
every
contract
for
large
volume
of
goods,
even
the
fixed
amount
of
goods
would
be
void
and
illegal
it
seems
to
me
because
it
would
engross
that
he
keeps
saying
an
enormous
volume
of
coal
or
an
enormous
volume
of
commerce
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
limiting
competition
within
the
framework
of
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
this
act
was
adopted.
in
regard
to
leverage,
while
it's
true
that
in
times-picayune
your
honor,
justice
clark
pointed
out
that
as
been
previously
pointed
out
in
standard
in
a
section
3
case,
assuming
that
you
had
a
contract
that
came
within
the
clayton
act
at
all
and
we're
talking
only
about
the
qualifying
clause
then
the
test
of
whether
or
not
it
came
within
the
qualifying
clause
could
be
either
that
the
seller
had
dominance
in
the
market
because
if
he
was
a
large
dominant
figure
in
the
market,
then
if
he
had
tying
contracts
or
exclusive
dealing
requirements
contracts,
it
could
be
assumed
that
he
was
building
up
his
monopoly.
and
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
standard
and
your
honor
picked
up
picayune
--
times-picayune,
if
you
got
to
take
net
requirements
contract,
even
though
there
isn't
dominance
for
the
purposes
of
the
requirements
clause,
it's
sufficient
to
show
a
substantial
portion
of
the
market,
but
that's
not
the
leverage
i've
been
talking
about.
the
leverage
that
is
necessary
in
any
clayton
act
case
whether
tying
or
requirements
is
the
one
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
the
one
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
later
in
commenting
on
the
--
the
--
the
standard
oil
case.
in
standard
oil,
we
recognize
the
discrepancy
of
bargaining
power
between
the
buyer
and
seller
and
pointed
out
that
the
retailers
might
still
insist
on
exclusive
contracts
if
they
wanted
to.
the
leverage
i'm
talking
about
here
and
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about
is
the
leverage
that
enables
a
seller
to
impose
a
restrictive
condition
on
then
buyer.
if
there
isn't
that
leverage,
you
don't
come
in
the
act
at
all.
even
though
there
is
that
leverage
and
therefore
you
come
within
the
act,
you
still
have
to
come
to
the
qualifying
clause
and
there,
there
is
this
question
of
whether
you
have
to
show
dominance
or
not
to
come
within
the
qualifying
clause.
you
can't
prove
you
come
within
the
principle
clause
by
proving
over
talking
about
cases
dealings
with
the
qualifying
clause.
and
i
submit
that
if
your
honors
come
to
read
the
briefs,
i
pointed
this
out
in
some
detail
in
my
reply
brief,
i
think
you
will
find
that
everyone
of
the
arguments,
that
mr.
fortas
has
made,
well
the
ones
he's
made
here
today
and
the
ones
that
he
makes
in
his
brief,
attempts
to
bring
this
contract
within
the
act
on
various
grounds
that
quantity
is
enormous
or
that
you
don't
need
leverage
or
whatever
other
arguments
he
has
made
are
taken
from
quotations
and
opinions
of
this
court
dealing
solely
with
the
qualifying
clause.
the
fact
is
that
every
case
that's
been
here,
all
you
ever
talked
about
is
the
qualifying
clause
and
your
opinion
started
by
saying
so
because
there,
there
was
a
plain
restrictive
exclusive
dealings
condition
at
the
beginning
in
standard
oil
contracts
against
it.
if
it
wasn't
for
the
qualifying
clause,
this
contract
would
obviously
be
unlawful.
here
the
question
is,
is
the
contract
unlawful
at
all?
and
i
say
you
can't
prove
the
contract
is
unlawful
in
the
sense
that
it
has
an
inclusive
dealing
condition
that
quoting
decisions
and
opinions
of
this
court
that
deals
solely
with
the
question
of
whether
being
a
contract
based
on
inclusive
dealing
condition
and
also
that
the
effect
of
lessening
competition
or
tending
to
create
a
monopoly.
