mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner,
carl
braden
was
convicted
of
contempt
of
congress
under
2
u.s.c.
192
as
a
result
of
his
refusal
to
answer
certain
questions
put
to
him
in
atlanta,
georgia
on
july
30th,
1958
by
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
the
questions
are
set
forth
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
in
pages
3
to
5
of
the
record
on
appeal.
since
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
questions
at
least
as
they
appear,
i
shall,
of
course,
have
to
explain
something
of
the
context
which
they
were
put.
the
petitioner
is
and
was
one
of
two
field
secretaries,
the
other
being
his
wife,
of
the
southern
conference
educational
fund,
an
organization
interested
in
furthering
the
cause
of
racial
integration
through
education.
the
president
is
mr.
aubrey
williams,
who
is
the
director
of
the
national
youth
administration
under
the
late
president
roosevelt.
the
petitioner
has
been
active
even
before
that
employment
in
the
field
of
racial
integration,
having
and
--
was
indicted
in
kentucky
under
a
state
law
for
sedition,
as
a
result
of
having
aided
a
negro
to
purchase
a
house
in
a
white
community.
the
sedition
indictment
and
conviction
were
eventually
overruled
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson,
which
played
a
part
in
petitioner's
hearing
before
the
house
committee.
on
may
21,
1958,
the
house
committee
passed
a
resolution
which
appeared
on
page
137
of
the
record,
directing
that
hearings
to
be
held
in
atlanta,
georgia
on
three
subjects.
the
first
is
what
it
called,
communist
organization
and
infiltration
in
the
textile
and
other
basic
industries
located
in
the
south.
the
second
is
communist
propaganda
activities
in
the
south
and
the
third,
the
entry
and
dissemination
within
the
united
states,
of
foreign
communist
party
propaganda.
and
they
say
at
the
beginning,
that
while
the
government's
brief
in
opposing
certiorari
states
on
page
2,
we
think
is
the
fact
that
the
actual
subject
matter
of
these
hearings
was,
"communist
infiltration
of
southern
industry."
i
emphasize
that
word
because
there
is
no
suggestion
that
mr.
braden
ever
had
any
connection
with
the
textile
or
other
industry.
actually,
the
government
takes
the
position,
that
all
three
of
the
subjects
of
the
current
investigation.
now,
your
honors
will
recall,
i
said
may
22
was
the
date
of
this
committee
resolution,
may
21.
between
may
21,
1958
and
july
23,
1958,
when
mr.
braden
was
served
with
a
subpoena,
directing
him
to
appear
on
the
second
day
of
the
hearing
on
july
30th,
he
continued
to
be
engaged
in
his
activities
on
behalf
of
the
southern
conference
educational
fund.
and
he
did
two
other
things
which
were
the
subject
to
the
hearings.
first,
he
played
a
part,
the
committee
believed
he
paid
--
played
a
major
part,
in
a
letter
sent
on
or
delivered
but
certainly
bearing
the
date
of
july
22,
1958
to
the
members
of
congress
and
signed
by
200
negro
leaders
in
the
south,
asking
the
congress
not
to
commit
the
house
committee
to
carryout
its
contended
visit
to
atlanta,
georgia,
on
the
theory
that
the
committee
would
--
that
there
would
be
a
confusion
between
un-american
activities
and
what
went
out,
it
were
regarded
by
many
people
in
the
south
with
un-american
activities,
namely,
furthering
racial
integration.
that
was
july
22,
which
happens
to
be
the
date
of
the
subpoena
that
was
issued
to
mr.
braden
and
served
on
him
on
july
23.
in
addition,
there
appears
in
the
record
here,
a
letter,
i
should
say,
by
the
way,
that
the
minister
--
the
negro
leader's
letter
is
at
page
98
of
the
record,
but
there
appears
in
addition,
what
i
will
refer
to
as
--
well,
the
sedition
letter,
though
it's
very
far
from
being
seditious.
it
appears
on
107
and
108
of
the
record
and
also
at
page
116
of
the
record
and
that
is
a
letter
which
mr.
braden
and
his
wife,
on
the
letterhead
of
this
--
of
the
southern
conference
educational
fund,
wrote
to
the
public,
to
their
fellow
citizens
asking
them
to
oppose
three
bills
then
pending
in
congress,
which
would
have
had
the
effect
of
overturning
the
decision
of
this
court
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson.
that
by
the
way
is
the
very
letter
which
is
the
subject
of
count
5,
of
the
indictment.
mr.
braden
appeared
at
the
congressional
committee
hearing
on
the
second
day
in
atlanta.
he
had
been
served
incidentally,
while
vacationing
at
the
seashore
home
of
mr.
harvey
o'connor,
the
chairman
of
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee,
a
committee
directed
principally
towards
the
vindication
of
civil
liberties,
a
contrary
distinction
of
southern
conference
was
interested
in
the
civil
rights,
that
distinction
can
be
made.
mr.
o'connor
is
a
well-known
biographer
of
industrial
leaders
principally
and
headed
by
then,
mr.
braden
and
its
entire
family
to
spend
their
time
in
little
compton,
rhode
island,
not
newport
but
near
newport.
i
mention
that
because
your
honors
will
see
that
two
other
counts
referred
to
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee.
when
mr.
braden
appeared
on
the
second
day,
he
was
interrogated
by
mr.
arens,
the
counsel
to
the
house
of
un-american
activities
committee,
on
this
subject
of
the
letter
which
had
been
sent
by
the
negro
leaders.
the
interrogation
appears
at
97
of
the
record
and
includes
an
attack
upon
a
negro
leaders
by
congressman
jackson,
who
first
charged
to
that
point
that
they
were,
were
practically
communists
and
later
on,
at
the
end
of
the
record,
after
some
further
thought,
said,
perhaps
they
were
only
dukes
and
gave
them
a
chance
to
exculpate
themselves
by
writing
to
the
committee
and
saying
that
they
really
didn't
know
what
they
were
doing,
your
honors
can
see
that.
then
mr.
arens
proceeded
to
examine
mr.
braden
with
respect
to
the
matters
which
are
set
forth
in
the
indictment
because
the
item
with
respect
to
the
negro
leaders
is
not
up
here
in
the
indictment,
although
mr.
braden
refused
to
answer
that,
as
well
as
the
other
questions.
before
i
come
to
the
question,
let
me
say,
that
the
refusal
to
answer
these
six
questions
set
forth
in
the
indictment
was
based
explicitly
upon
the
first
amendment
and
explicitly,
upon
this
court's
decision
in
watkins
and
in
sweezy
and
other
cases,
that
the
issue
of
pertinency
was
raised
by
mr.
braden
explicitly,
a
lack
of
legislative
purpose,
the
vagueness
of
the
committee's
mandate,
all
of
the
textures
that
could
be
raised,
were
raised
at
that
point.
your
honors
will
recall
that
this
occurred
after
the
watkins
decision
in
1957
and
before
the
barenblatt
decision
was
therefore,
no
occasion
from
mr.
--
from
mr.
braden
to
mention
barenblatt
would
it
take
that
into
consideration.
now,
mr.
arens
in
the
course
of
the
extended
colloquy
which
appears
between
89
and
110
of
the
record,
charged
mr.
braden
with
respect
to
this
letter
which
is
referred
to
in
count
5,
a
stimulating
political
pressure
against
security
as
if
a
letter
to
ones
fellow
citizens,
which
is
reproduced
in
the
record,
should
be
subject
to
criticism
and
also
said
that
he
thought
that
they
wanted
information
concerning
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
because
they
might
want
to
cite,
c.i.t.e
that
organization
as
a
communist
front
or
a
subversive
organization
as
they
referred
to
the
committee.
now,
i
come
down
to
the
counts
in
the
indictment.
the
first
counts,
1
and
2,
appearing
on
page
3,
"did
you
participate
in
a
meeting
here
at
that
time
and
who
solicited
the
quarters
to
be
made
available
to
the
southern
conference
educational
fund,
related
to
a
meeting,
only
secret
ones,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
of
the
executive
board
of
the
southern
conference
educational
fund
headed
by
its
officers
at
the
american
red
cross
building
in
atlanta,
georgia?"
and
while
the
record
seems
to
indicate
that
mr.
braden
did
participate
from
further
cross-examination
of
him,
he
declined
to
answer
these
two
questions
for
the
reasons
stated.
the
next
two
questions
"are
you
connected
with
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee
and
did
you
and
harvey
o'connor
in
the
course
of
your
conference
there
in
rhode
island,
developed
plans
and
strategies,
somewhat
frightening
phrase,
outlining
work
schedules
for
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee?"
i
suspect
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
any
connection
between
mr.
braden
and
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee,
except
as
being
the
guest
of
a
more
well-to-do
host,
who
happened
to
have
a
seashore
home,
i
suspect
that
if
the
marshal
had
not
found
mr.
braden
at
the
home
of
mr.
o'connor,
these
questions
were
never
have
been
asked,
but
there
is
no
connection
between
mr.
braden
and
mr.
o'connor
or
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee.
i
came
to
the
last
question
first
because
i
want
to
come
to
--
except,
being
the
most
interesting.
i
would
just
like
to
ask
you
whether
or
not,
you
being
a
resident
of
louisville,
kentucky,
had
anything
to
do
there
with
the
southern
newsletter?
now,
oddly
enough,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record,
even
the
hearing
which
mr.
braden
appeared
or
in
a
trial
to
indicate
what
the
--
the
southern
newsletter
is.
other
witnesses
testified
generally
on
the
subject
and
it
appears
to
be
a
periodical
devoted
furthering
the
cause
integration.
although
mr.
braden
is
not
the
editor
of
that
but
of
another
paper,
which
he
refers
to
in
the
record
and
all
that
mr.
arens
could
say
on
the
trial
is
that
he
thinks
that
the
southern
newsletter
sort
of
--
some
sort
of
a
pamphlet
that
you
fold
up.
this
is
all
the
content
with
respect
to
this
putatively
seditious
document.
i
should
add
also
that
at
the
course
of
the
hearings
at
which
mr.
braden
appeared
on
july
30th,
and
on
the
course
of
the
trial,
there
was
not
a
single
word
of
testimony.
i
mean
testimony,
i'm
not
talking
about
hearsay
or
opinions
as
mr.
arens
gave
a
great
deal
of
that
and
it
was
characterized
by
the
court
which
accepted
it
as
merely
hearsay
and
is
not
proof
of
facts.
there
is
no
--
no
evidence
in
this
record
at
all
that
the
southern
conference
or
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee
or
the
southern
newsletter
are
communist
organizations
or
periodical
in
the
last
case
or
that
mr.
o'connor
or
that
mr.
braden
is
or
was,
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
i'm
not
suggesting
now
that
i
would
have
a
different
view
as
to
the
rights
of
mr.
braden,
bad
in
such
evidence.
i
don't
have
to
meet
that
issue
in
this
case.
then
came
a
trial,
first
it
was
a
citation,
there
was
in
indictment
and
a
trial.
then
at
the
trial,
mr.
arens
testified
again.
i
mentioned
before
that
he
stated
it
was
the
committee's
understanding
that
these
people
were
communists.
it
was
the
committee's
information
that
they
were,
in
those
special
cases
and
he
repeated
his
interest
in
citing
emergency
civil
liberties
committee.
he
described
the
petition
of
the
negro
ministers
as
an
attempt
to
preclude,
i'm
referring
now
to
page
29
of
the
record,
preclude
committee
and
soften
committee
hearings
as
no
one
appealed
to
the
statement
of
the
house
and
the
members
house,
was
again
subject
to
criticism
and
referred
to
generally,
on
page
29
of
the
record,
and
this
is
count
5
of
course,
at
least
one
of
the
letters
--
one
of
the
letters,
with
a
letter
signed
by
mr.
braden
and
another
person,
his
wife,
i
say,
urging
congressional
action
of
some
kind.
and
of
course,
this
was
a
subject
of
count
5,
which
says,
"were
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party,"
the
instant,
your
honors
aren't
here
to
hear
the
dramatic
inflection
of
the
question,
the
instant
that
you
affixed
your
signature
to
that
letter.
this
was
not
a
--
a
general
inquiry
of
the
communist
party,
the
inquiry
had
been
contained
in
the
letter
and
the
effort
was
made
to
criticize
the
writing
of
a
letter
or
to
undercut
its
appeal
at
--
on
the
theory
that
perhaps,
mr.
braden
at
that
instant,
which
is
also
that
the
(inaudible)
are
concerned
about
that
are
members
of
the
communist
party.
now,
we
come
down
to
our
argument.
first,
while
taking
the
position
as
we
have
in
the
briefs
that
we
do
not
--
or
as
differentially
concur
in
this
court's
decision
of
the
barenblatt
case.
we
do
not
feel
that
that
issue
has
to
be
met
in
this
case,
because
neither
the
rationale
of
barenblatt
nor
the
facts
in
that
case,
are
the
same
as
the
rationale
which
we
think,
controls
this
case
and
the
facts
in
this
case.
let
me
state
in
a
few
lines
that
why
we
feel
that
to
be
the
case.
in
barenblatt,
this
court
held
that
an
inquiry
into
barenblatt's
membership
better
known
into
the
communist
party
--
in
a
communist
party,
could
be
made
notwithstanding
what
was
recognized
in
the
majority
opinion,
of
course,
in
the
other
opinion,
as
an
intrusion
into
the
first
amendment
area.
the
theory
--
theory
on
which
the
right
to
ask
was
held
to
outweigh
the
right
to
refuse,
was
the
theory
of
what
it
called
self-defense
of
the
government,
citing
or
paraphrasing
dennis,
namely
the
right
of
the
government
to
investigate
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
now,
the
court
held
that
that
communist
party
was
by
its
tenants,
so
aligned
to
the
doctrine
of
the
overthrow
the
government
that
it
was
proper
to
substitute
the
words
communist
party
for
the
words,
those
who
want
to
overthrow
the
government.
and
therefore,
that
this
intrusion
was
permissible.
now,
of
course,
this
court
recognized
in
barenblatt
not
only
by
its
devotion,
its
analysis
of
the
communist
party,
but
by
the
questions
which
it
did
not
decide,
which
your
honors
will
recall,
namely,
other
peoples
membership
in
the
communist
party
and
finally
barenblatt's
connection
with
the
art
sciences
and
professions
group,
recognized
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
group
which
it
regarded
and
as
sui
generic
a
special
dangerous
group
and
in
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
--
in
sweezy,
this
point
is
made
that
there
is
a
special
status
to
the
communist
party
--
of
the
communist
party.
the
court
in
making
its
decision
in
barenblatt,
relied
upon
a
combination
of
i
think
what
we
can
call,
judicial
notice
based
upon
prior
trials
of
dennis
etcetera
and
based
upon
the
variety
of
legislation
in
which
congress
perhaps,
violating
the
principles
against
the
(inaudible)
perhaps
not
has
made
findings
with
respect
to
the
communist
party.
now,
in
the
present
case
as
i've
indicated,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
communist
party.
he
only
mentioned
that
the
communist
party
is
in
count
5,
which
i
think
for
the
reason
which
i
will
indicate,
as
a
weakest
count
for
the
government.
i'm
rather
pleased
that
the
government
thinks,
is
the
strongest
count
here.
all
of
these
others
deal
with
organizations,
which
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
have
been
devoting
themselves
to
good
causes.
and
they
say
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee,
a
sponsor
to
at
least
three
cases
in
this
court,
i
think
that
its
principal
function
(inaudible)
against
casey
(inaudible)
and
abramowitz
against
brucker
and
no
one
could
suggest
dysfunctioning
of
those
cases,
bought
it
within
the
ambit
of
barenblatt.
now,
i
say
again
that
there
was
not
a
word
in
the
record
of
a
single
witness,
there
was
a
testimony
by
the
way
in
barenblatt
on
this
subject,
a
single
witness
that
these
people
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
or
that
the
organizations
were
subversive
organizations
of
any
kind.
and
we
say
that
we
do
not
here,
have
what
was
called
in
sweezy,
compelling
reasons,
what
was
called
in
kelly
the
same,
what
was
called
in
bates
cogent
reasons,
what
was
called
in
n.a.a.c.p.
against
alabama
controlling
the
substantial
reasons
for
overriding
what
are
recognized
to
be
first
amendment
rights
that
we
were
dealing
in
some
of
these
cases
with
--
with
the
recognition
that
communist
party
within
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
right
to
be
overrule,
surely,
that
will
apply
here
in
the
organizations
that
i
am
discussing.
now,
i
turn
specifically
to
count
5
because
there
we
regard,
it
has
the
most
dangerous
argument
that
can
be
made
by
a
government
because
count
5
involves
an
appeal
for
one's
fellow
citizen
to
protest
against
pending
legislation.
well,
this
is
a
very
far
cry,
it
hardly
needs
to
be
argued,
very
far
cry
from
the
violent
overthrow
the
government
that
in
one
of
the
earliest
cases
as
second
circuit
indicated
referring
to
the
judgment
can
take
of
course
was
within
the
permissible
ambit
of
this
vague
or
what
we
thought
was
vague
language
in
house
resolution
5
and
its
predecessors.
it's
certainly
a
far
cry
from
the
violent
overthrow
the
government
discussed
here.
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
and
i
may
say
mr.
justice
stewart
that
it
is
interesting
that
not
only
does
it
appear
there
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
apparently,
i
thought
it
was
sufficiently
important
to
reprint
entirely.
i
--
i
was
amazed
by
that.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
thought
it
was
important
enough,
critical
enough
to
the
conviction
here
of
the
defendant
or
the
offender
to
the
conviction
to
reproduce
the
letter
itself
on
page
116
of
the
record.
and,
when
one
bears
in
mind
that
not
only
the
rationale
of
barenblatt
and
of
this
overwriting
of
first
amendment,
but
more
affirmatively,
the
meaning
of
the
right
of
petition,
a
right
which
i
think
really
is
antecedent
to
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
in
the
anglo-saxon
world,
a
right
which
appears
in
magna
carta
in
the
petition
of
right,
one
is
rather
surprised
at
the
emphasis
placed
by
the
court
below
and
by
the
government
on
this
exercise
of
the
right
to
petition.
i
would
have
said
that
the
government
should
welcome
even
the
use
by
communist
of
the
right
to
petition
as
against
the
imputed
desire
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
now,
when
i
read
the
government's
brief
and
i
should
like
to
give
your
honors
one
or
two
quotations
from
its
reference.
i'm
again
rather
surprised
as
the
emphasis
made
on
count
5.
at
page
33
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case,
it
refers
to
spreading
party
propaganda
to
petitions
to
congress.
well,
it
is
suggested
that
the
congress
will
be
enticed
into
membership
of
the
communist
party
and
of
course,
when
we
examine
the
petition
itself,
two
petitions
are
involved
here.
the
negro
ministers,
negro
leaders
and
mr.
and
mrs.
braden,
how
can
that
possibly
be
considered
communist
propaganda?
page
44,
the
government
says,
the
communists
were
circulating
petitions
in
the
south
concerning
legislative
activity,
it
refers
to
the
pennsylvania
against
nelson
bills.
surely,
that
is
permissible
and
that
need
a
kind
of
activity
that
we
want.
then
a
reference
is
made
later
on,
an
effort
to
petition
congress
with
the
communist
infiltration
and
propaganda
activity
on
page
53
and
on
54,
the
party
efforts
to
pressure
or
influence
congress
act
as
the
security
measures.
when
one
places
these
remarks
in
the
government's
brief.
again,
as
what
mr.
justice
brandeis
has
said
in
gilbert
against
minnesota
in
dissenting
--
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
whitney
against
california,
it
is
impossible
to
reconcile
the
reliance
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
upon
an
active
political
force
in
the
community
actively
engaged
in
playing
the
part
of
the
democratic
process.
and
what
is
really
the
most
undemocratic,
the
most
un-american
i
would
respectfully
suggest
--
suggestion
that
petition
should
not
be
permitted
or
that
they
should
be
--
i
think
they
should
be
dissuaded
sanctions
to
be
imposed
upon
the
petitioner
by
the
investigation
of
their
political
affiliations.
there
is
of
course
a
massive
history
and
if
time
permitted
and
if
i
have
well
learning,
i
should
probably
indicate
it
to
the
court
that
there
are
few
things
that
i
came
across
recently
that's
quite
interesting.
one
was
an
early
sedition
case,
an
early
case
against
william
(inaudible)
if
your
honors
will
recall
1798
would
be
added
to
the
philadelphia
aurora
and
he
was
charged
--
i
may
say
he
was
acquitted
in
30
minutes,
he
was
charge
with
being
evilly
disposed
because
he
willfully
and
maliciously
stirred
up
a
seditious
riot
(inaudible)
by
attempting
to
obtain
signatures
to
a
petition
against
the
alien
law.
and
your
honors
will
recall
at
john
quincy
adams
as
a
congressman
in
1837
where
he
had
a
very
vigorous
fight
in
the
congress
over
the
question
none
of
which
he
could
ask
people
whether
they
were
members
of
any
organization
but
whether
the
congress
should
not
table
or
consider
petitions
which
were
filed
with
it.
he
wanted
them
to
consider
it
and
he
said,
and
describe
that
interesting,
he
said
it
very
doubtfully,
the
next
step
will
be
to
inquire
--
it's
the
political
belief
of
petitioners.
for
a
quite
number
of
years
from
1837
to
date
before
the
congress
decided
to
do
that
or
a
committee
decided
to
do
that.
now,
i
turn
to
my
second
point
but
i
want
to
leave
enough
time
for
mr.
coe,
my
distinguished
colleague
here
to
argue,
i
think
in
the
second
point
which
is
was
there
a
legislative
purpose
in
this
investigation
in
atlanta
and
specifically
with
respect
to
our
client,
mr.
braden,
there
is
considerable
doubt
on
our
mind
as
to
whether
the
investigation
in
atlanta
at
all
had
a
legislative
purpose
for
anybody
because
the
principal
witnesses
who
testified
there,
one
on
this
colonization
of
the
textile
industry,
mr.
penia,
had
given
exactly
the
same
testimony
in
boston
in
march
and
he
named
exactly
the
same
people
who
had
worked
under
his
direction
in
the
textile
industry.
therefore,
i
can't
quite
say
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
in
atlanta,
georgia
except,
a
repetition
of
headlines
in
the
press.
and
mr.
fishman,
the
collector
of
--
deputy
collector
of
customs
--
director
of
customs,
testified
as
to
the
importation
of
foreign
propaganda,
exactly
what
he
has
testified
to
between
7
and
12
times
in
the
united
states
for
that
and
several
times
after.
i
do
not
have
to
sustain
the
burden,
i'm
sure
of
persuading
the
court
that
the
entire
hearing
in
atlanta
had
no
legislative
objective
but
that
of
exposure,
etcetera.
if
i
can
limit
myself
to
mr.
braden,
in
mr.
braden's
case,
we
say
that
there
are
four
basic
non-legislative
purposes
of
the
interrogation.
the
first
is
that
this
is
an
attempt
despite
full
critics
of
the
committee.
not
only
the
interrogation
here,
but
your
honor
will
see
the
1958
annual
report
of
the
committee
which
we
have
quoted,
"in
referring
to
the
atlanta
cases
of
mr.
wilkinson
and
mr.
braden,
describes
them
in
connection
with
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee
and
that
committee's
criticism
of
the
house
of
un-american
activities
committee."
but
i
failed
to
indicate
your
honors
that
there
is
one
thing
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee
has
done
besides
sponsoring
cases
in
this
court,
it
has
led
an
obviously
ineffectual
campaign
against
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities,
by
asking
congressmen
to
oppose
it
not
to
--
to
a
continuous
its
existence.
i
don't
think
that
the
failure
is
necessarily
a
ground
for
a
private
conviction
of
mr.
braden.
but,
not
only
was
mr.
braden
subpoenaed
here,
but
mr.
wilkinson
in
the
next
case,
who
appeared
in
atlanta,
georgia
and
who
is
the
subject
to
the
most
interesting
admission
by
committee
counsel
i
think,
namely
if
you
had
not
appeared
here
in
atlanta,
georgia,
said
mr.
arens
and
mr.
wilkinson,
we
would
to
oppose
the
committee,
we
would
never
have
subpoenaed
you
and
the
committee
couples
braden
and
wilkinson
together.
and
i
may
say
that
mr.
o'connor
did
not
escape
either,
because
if
he
was
about
to
address
a
public
meeting
(inaudible)
critical
of
the
committee,
which
is
holding
hearing
there,
he
was
subpoenaed
and
has
been
indicted
for
failure
to
appear.
we
have
here
three
critics
of
the
committee,
thus
far
subpoenaed
and
we
have
the
committee's
attacks
upon
the
emergency
civil
liberties
committee,
quite
vigorous
and
perhaps
understandable
if
not
justifiable,
since
we
have
thought
that
the
people
were
sovereign
rather
than
the
committees,
but
there's
a
difference
between
the
committee
putting
out
of
publication,
which
one
can't
enjoin
this
distribution
of
publication
of
and
subpoenaing
a
witness
and
compelling
him
to
testify
because
he
is
a
critic.
now,
the
second
objection,
oh,
i
--
i
should
tell
your
honors
one
thing
and
that
goes
back
to
the
wilkinson
brief
if
your
honors
do
not
have
that
brief
before
you,
i
assume
at
the
moment,
because
it's
the
government's
theory
on
why
it
has
the
right
to
subpoena
critics
of
the
committee.
a
--
i
won't
even
call
it
a
radical,
i
would
call
it
a
violent
extension
of
barenblatt.
in
the
wilkinson
brief,
the
government
says
at
page
53
and
54,
the
reason
why
it
has
to
--
it
has
a
right
to
examine
braden
and
other
critics
is
because
this
committee
constantly
has
before
it,
the
issues
whether
it
should
be
abolished,
continue
present
course
or
change
or
expand
its
activities.
and
therefore,
it
has
a
right
to
call
a
man,
make
him
testify
because
it
wants
information
from
him
as
to
whether
it
should
expand
it.
applying
for
the
present
case,
the
committee
would
then
say,
we
call
mr.
braden
and
mr.
wilkinson
before
us,
because
we
wanted
to
know
whether
we
should
abolish
ourselves.
and
the
reason
we
asked
them
whether
or
not,
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party,
was
because
we
wanted
to
know
whether
it
discount
their
recommendations
to
us
that
we
be
abolished.
i
think
the
government's
statement
at
page
53
and
54
in
wilkinson,
i
wish
it
had
been
in
a
braden
brief.
i
cast
your
honors,
will
apply
the
admission
from
one
to
the
other,
is
the
most
valuable
admission
and
of
course,
i
wish
it
was
really
true
but
--
but
we
all
know
the
committee
did
not
call
mr.
braden
and
mr.
wilkinson
because
it
wanted
to
evaluate
their
evaluation
of
the
committee's
progress.
now,
the
third
--
the
third
objection
we
find
here,
you
can
say,
the
second,
is
the
theory
of
citation.
the
desire
to
get
information
from
braden
and
from
these
other
people,
as
to
whether
organization,
should
be
cited
as
communist
organizations.
and
we
have
a
considerable
doubt
and
this
court
will
resolve
that
doubt
possibly
at
the
sacb
case,
which
i
have
no
connection
with,
as
to
whether
any
branch
of
the
government,
even
one
created
by
a
statute,
having
quasi-judicial
functions,
subject
to
judicial
review
as
a
history
of
that
case
has
shown,
whether
any
governmental
agency
has
the
power
to
condemn
an
organization
as
subversive.
but,
assuming
for
the
moment
that
somewhere
there
is
a
branch
of
the
government
that
can
exercise
what
is
really
a
judicial
function,
if
it
is
any
function,
surely
that
isn't
a
function
of
a
congressional
committee
to
cite
and
to
declare
subversive.
again,
we
say
we
can't
stop
the
committee
in
doing
so
if
it
publishes
a
--
a
leaflet.
(inaudible)
federation
against
eastland,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
indicates
that
we
can't
do
that,
but
--
and
there
is
considerable
doubt
as
to
whether
in
the
interest
of
freedom
of
speech
of
congress,
we
should
do
that.
although
i
was
involved
in
the
case,
i
have
some
reservations
about
whether
it
was
proper,
but
to
compel
people
to
come
forward
and
make
them
testify
so
that
a
judgment
of
a
congressional
committee
or
any
committee,
should
come
down
very
questionable.
now,
as
far
as
the
third
point,
the
investigation
of
political
pressure;
in
short,
the
government
argues
that
it
has
right
to
determine
whether
the
opposition
of
mr.
and
mrs.
braden
to
the
security
bills
pending
on
the
congress,
in
our
position
that
many
fine
people
adhere
to
and
that
was
successful
in
opposing
the
bills.
but
they
have
a
right
to
determine
what
this
political
pressure
is.
now,
again
we
say,
this
is
a
--
a
complete
revolution.
it
is
one
thing
to
examine.
overthrow
the
government,
is
one
thing
to
examine
things
within
the
formula
of
force
and
violence,
but
to
examine
political
pressure
openly
made,
this
we
suggest
is
again
not
a
legislative
function.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
think
--
i
think,
your
honor
--
i
think
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
think,
your
honor
is
--
it
has
to
decide
whether
or
not,
the
committee
had
a
legislative
purpose
or
whether
the
questions
are
of
the
barenblatt
type
or
whether
they
fall
within
the
character
that
i've
indicated.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
am
a
little
puzzled
--
your
honor,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
relying
upon
one
question,
or
four.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
that
the
opinion
is
somewhat
ambiguous.
i've
looked
at
it
again.
your
honor
will
--
is
referring
to
the
opinion
at
page
112
and
there,
the
court
at
page
118
discusses
the
southern
conference,
apparently
educational
fund.
you
see
--
your
honor,
the
court
doesn't
refer
to
particular
counts.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
do
discuss
count
3
and
i
was
going
to
indicate
your
honor
that
they
do
not
discuss
count
5
at
all,
the
question
of
the
signature
to
the
letter,
but
either
--
or
the
southern
newsletter,
but
there
is
some
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
i
think
the
opinion
is
ambiguous.
i
--
i
must
say
that
fairly
in
fairness
to
the
government,
to
the
court
below.
i
think
it
is
possible
that
the
opinion
also
refers
to
questions
concerning
the
southern
conference
educational
fund,
if
your
honor
will
see
the
paragraph
directly
above
that.
but
i
do
not
know.
it's
an
ambiguous
statement.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
but
the
question
is
whether
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly.
i
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
--
my
only
hesitation
about
exceeding
to
what
is
of
course
helpful
to
the
petitioner
here,
is
the
ambiguity
of
that
paragraph
on
page
118.
but
i
want
to
leave
it
at
that.
i
trust
your
--
i
hope
your
honors
will
come
to
that
conclusion,
but
i
can't
say
that
it
is
fourth
at
the
moment
as
i
analyze
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes,
but
i
--
that's
the
problem
on
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
finally,
i
want
to
indicate
to
your
honors
that
the
fourth
objective,
which
is
called
the
investigation
of
the
motives
of
people
fighting
integration,
is
again
a
very
harmful
doctrine
and
that
we
suggest
is
a
non-legislative
one.
now,
in
the
few
minutes
remaining,
because
i've
have
extended
myself
in
this
very
point,
at
least
we
made
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
indicate
two
other
basic
objections
that
we
have
and
state
them
somewhat,
some
reforms
such
as
of
course,
to
the
court.
the
first
relates
to
the
vagueness
of
the
resolution
creating
that
committee.
and
we
are
of
course
well
aware
of
what
this
court
said
in
barenblatt.
we
read
the
court's
language
in
barenblatt
to
mean
that
based
upon
the
legislative
history,
not
the
language
necessarily
of
house
resolution
5
and
its
predecessor,
a
legislative
history
knowledge
of
which
is
imputed
to
the
witness,
barenblatt,
he
should've
known
that
membership
on
the
communist
party
and
communist
party
activities
as
such,
were
subject
to
investigation
by
the
congress.
and
we
suggest
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
rule
in
barenblatt,
this
witness
could
not
have
known
by
reading
house
resolution
5
and
we
do
not
think,
by
reading
the
legislative
history
that
questions
concerning
his
motives,
questions
concerning
petitions
that
congress
were
within
the
ambit
of
house
resolution
5
and
if
so,
then
we
say
that
the
statute's
resolution
was
vague.
now,
finally,
i
come
down
to
our
reliance
upon
the
watkins
decision.
and
what
we
say
there
is
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
--
it
is
exactly
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
finally,
i
come
down
to
our
last
basic
point
which
is
the
reliance
of
the
witness
explicitly
upon
this
court's
opinion
in
watkins
case.
now,
your
honors
again,
will
recall
that
this
occurred
after
watkins
and
before
barenblatt.
and
we
suggest
here
that
where
there
is
the
problem
of
statutory
construction,
whether
we
had
to
impute
the
word,
willfully,
to
the
word
as
such
vague
ambiguity
itself,
into
the
statute
to
u.s.c.
192
or
whether
we
had
to
consider
this
a
matter
of
due
process
of
essential
failed
fairness,
i
think
that
the
latter
more
than
the
former,
that
it
is
unfair
and
so
unfair
as
to
be
a
denial
of
due
process
to
take
a
witness,
particularly
confronted
with
questions
like
this,
take
a
witness,
following
watkins,
who
has
read
watkins
and
to
believe
that
he
could
not
unreasonably
have
said
to
himself,
i
thus
--
this
resolution
is
so
vague,
it
in
--
inviolate
first
amendment
rights
that
i
do
not
have
to
obey
this
--
answer
these
questions.
now,
we
are
told
by
the
government
that
sinclair
says
that
a
man
takes
a
risk,
but
of
course,
sinclair
with
the
reliance
upon
a
man's
lawyer,
he
takes
a
direct
risk
when
he
hires
a
lawyer
to
begin
with
and
this
is
very
different
from
following
the
opinion
--
that
opinion
described
by
five
members
of
this
court,
toward
opinion
by
even
three
members
of
the
court
and,
we
think
that
regardless
of
whether
watkins
has
been
modified
or
whether
barenblatt
can
be
reconciled
with
it,
whether
the
two
are
consistent,
it
was
not
unreasonable,
not
unreasonable
for
mr.
braden
to
rely
upon
that
decision.
when
one
considers
the
--
the
cloud
as
follows,
that
cloud
is
followed
in
a
dispute,
among
judges,
judge
youngdowd
decided
that
barenblatt
meant
what
mr.
braden
says
in
meant,
in
united
states
against
peck
and
indeed,
many
members
of
the
congress
--
house
committee
thought
so.
they
were
fighting
for
a
resolution
to
give
the
committee
new
authority,
the
explicit
one.
they
never
pushed
it
through.
and
congressman
shearer
was
an
active
member,
a
very
articulate
member
of
this
committee,
said
in
the
course
of
the
hearing
which
i
have
hear
on
investigation
of
communist
penetration
facilities,
when
somebody
mentioned
united
states
against
peck,
he
said,
i
will
have
to
take
the
fifth
amendment
before
commenting
on
that
decision,
this
is
congressman
shearer.
the
–
there
was
a
very
great
looseness
in
discussing
constitutional
rights
by
this
committee
and
then
he
says,
but
judge
youngdowd
in
that
opinion
said,
this
witness
here
today,
if
he
didn't
want
to
cooperate
and
do
the
fine
job
that
he
is
for
the
government,
consider
here
and
refused
that
tell
us
who
were
the
party,
whether
at
the
time
he
was
member
of
the
party.
he
can
evoke
the
first
amendment
or
refuse
to
tell
it.
that
is
what
judge
youngdowd
said
in
that
opinion.
of
course,
he
is
following
the
supreme
court.
well,
i
suggest
that
mr.
braden's
reliance
upon
the
opinion
in
this
court,
at
least,
means
that
essential
fairness
should
not
call
his
conviction.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
its
opinion
in
raleigh,
where
he
talks
about
conflicting
demands
and
we
think
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
watkins,
which
was
a
demand
which
conflicted
with
at
least
what
the
committee
believed
was
a
mandate
of
the
statute.
and
of
course,
your
honors
will
recall
the
two
murdock
cases,
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
where
murdock
was
acquitted
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
improperly
pleaded
the
fifth
amendment
before
a
federal
agency,
relying
upon
the
danger
of
incrimination
before
a
state,
because
the
court
said
at
290
u.s.,
until
we
had
spoken
in
284
u.s.,
the
witness
didn't
know
what
his
rights
were
under
the
fifth
amendment.
well,
we
say,
he
didn't
know
in
this
case,
unless
this
court
were
to
decide
to
reverse
barenblatt,
which
of
course,
we
hope
it
will
do,
in
the
proper
case.
this
witness
knew
no
more
than
murdock
did.
and
they
say
that
what
i
am
now
suggesting
is
not
to
be
taken
as
an
indication
that
we
are
relying
exclusively
upon
murdock
--
upon
the
--
the
watkins
decision
my
--
the
whole
burden
thrust
of
my
argument
is
then
that
this
is
a
very
different
case
from
a
barenblatt.
and
finally
in
the
last
minute,
let
me
again
suggest
to
your
honors,
most
respectfully,
we
have
had
a
considerable
difficulty
in
determining
whether
to
make
a
direct
and
unambiguous
attack.
most
differentially
of
course,
upon
the
barenblatt
decision.
and,
we
have
indicated
why
we
think
that
decision
was
an
error
and
why
the
entire
legislative
history
of
this
committee
has
been
directed
toward
exposure.
but
we
have
--
have
to
say
to
the
members
of
bar
before
this
court,
that
we
think,
this
is
a
very
different
case
in
barenblatt
and
while
--
to
the
extent
that
advocates
can,
we
express
our
regret
at
the
barenblatt
decision.
we
feel
very
strongly
that
this
case
would
be
a
radical
extension
of
the
barenblatt
doctrine
going
to
the
heart
of
the
right
of
petition,
the
heart
of
the
democratic
process
and
would
cover
organizations
never
contemplated
by
the
principle
of
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
or
violence.
i
thank,
your
honors.
mr.
coe
will
handle
the
rebuttal
i
should've
told
you
that.
