mr.
boudin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
yeagley.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
just
refer
to
the
question
that
--
that
justice
frankfurter
propounded
to
counsel,
do
you
consider
--
you
don't
consider
that
everything
is
out
of
this
case
except,
count
3
as
a
--
as
justice
frankfurter's
reading
of
the
decision
implied.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
of
course,
if
you
don't
rely
on
just
one
count
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
counsel
on
the
other
side
shouldn't
have
to
--
to
devote
his
attention
to
just
one
count
either,
should
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
is
there
--
is
it
your
position
that
every
time
anyone
writes
a
letter
to
the
congress
or
to
a
congressman
criticizing
either
the
congress
or
the
committee
or
to
particular
congressman,
that
--
that
that
brings
about
a
legislative
purpose,
which
would
authorize
him
to
call
him
up
before
the
committee
and
ask
him
if
he's
a
communist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
this
just
about
as
--
isn't
this
just
about
as
broad
as
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
would
like
to
change
my
question
then
to
refer
to
writing
a
letter
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
positions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
interest
if
the
--
if
the
thing
that
what
was
done
was
legitimate?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
now
that
they
do
have
in
this
case,
wouldn't
they
have
that
right
in
the
case
of
any
individual
who
--
who
wrote
the
letter
such
as
this
to
summon
him
before
the
committee
and
asking
if
he
weren't
in
the
congress.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
letter
is
the
letter,
the
letter
--
whatever
it
is,
it
is
and
to
you
--
you
say
that
they
have
a
right
to
inquire
into
what's
behind
it.
now,
wouldn't
they
have
the
right
to
do
that
with
any
citizen,
that
they
have
the
right
to
do
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
suppose
they
said
that
with
any
--
any
citizen
that
they
summoned
before
the
committee,
our
purpose
is
to
inquire
whether
this
petition
you
have
made
to
--
to
the
government
is
communist
inspired.
are
you
a
communist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
they
have
there
information
that
he
was
a
communist
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
mean
they
asked
him
whether
they
--
whether
they
knew
--
where
they
had
information
or
not,
whether
communist
they
asked
him
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
evidence
against
him
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
this
contempt
matter?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
can
you
base
--
can
you
base
a
commitment
on
it,
if
it
isn't?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
his
own
home?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is,
supposedly
his
--
his
own
house
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
well
that's
our
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
he
convicted
to
that
offence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
yeagley,
mr.
boudin
read
something
from
--
that
the
committee
stated
to
one
of
these
witnesses
to
the
effect
that
we
never
had
any
idea
of
--
we
never
had
any
idea
of
subpoenaing
you
at
all.
we
didn't
--
we
didn't
think
anything
of
you,
until
we
found
you
were
in
town
here
and
you
were
--
you
were
working
on
this
integration
that
matters
so
--
so
we
subpoenaed
you.
that's
the
reason
we
subpoenaed
you.
now
is
that
--
was
that
true?
did
he
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
would
we
--
where
would
we
find
--
where
would
we
find
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren

chief
justice
earl
warren
219
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
got
wilkinson
here
and
it
jumps
from
page
70
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
--
oh,
i
--
i
see.
oh
yes,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it's
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
suppose
that
if
you're
entitled
to
bind
the
witness
by
his
failure
to
raise
every
time
the
objection
that
he
originally
made
that
--
that
you
also
should
be
bound
by
the
fact
that
each
time
you
don't
explain.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
those
two
things
ouoght
to
balance
up,
pretty
well,
but
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i've
been
wondering
since
counsel
stated
the
fact
of
why
it
was
that
the
committee
had
one
sort
of
a
traveling
witness
who
went
--
went
with
them
on
not
once,
but
a
dozen
or
so
times
and
gave
the
same
testimony
on
each
occasion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
don't
remember
who
it
is,
that
counsel
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
has
the
same
--
to
the
same
effect
and
name
the
same
persons.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
there
was
another
witness,
he
said
who
had
--
who
had
just
finished
testifying
in
boston
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
exactly
the
same
things.
why
would
be
down
in
there
repeating
all
this
if
this
was
a
fact
finding
expedition?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
of
course
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
his
written
testimony,
for
there
is
new
testimony,
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
only
thing
i
understood
from
mr.
boudin
that
it
was
the
identical
testimony
that
he
had
just
given
up
in
boston
and
then
he
was
taken
down
there
to
testify
the
same
thing
and
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see
--
i
see,
alright.
in
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright
--
alright
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you've
been
interrupted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
up
close,
not
to
make
it
in
an
orderly
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
coe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
want
to
consult
with
mr.
boudin
on
it,
you
may
do
so
and
then
answer
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
very
well.
