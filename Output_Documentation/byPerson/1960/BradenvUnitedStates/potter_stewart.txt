justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
just
saw
it
and
i
try
to
understand
it.
the
--
the
letter
referred
to
in
the
question
covered
by
count
5
appears
on
page
107
of
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but
count
5
was
not
--
was
not
relied
on
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
not
discussed
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
--
isn't
there
a
substantial
difference?
in
barenblatt,
the
subcommittee
was
investigating
communist
infiltration
in
the
educational
institutions
--
over
a
long
period
of
time.
here,
the
question
referred
to
the
petitioner's
membership
in
the
communist
party
at
a
particular
moment.
they
--
they
--
the
moment
being
at
the
time
he
sent
a
perfectly
proper
letter
to
congress,
having
nothing
to
do
at
all
on
it's
face,
would
overthrow
the
united
states
government
by
force
and
violence.
isn't
the
context,
the
very
context
of
the
questions
in
barenblatt
on
the
one
hand
and
then
this
case
on
the
other,
doesn't
that
difference
in
context
make
a
substantial
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
asking
others,
the
recipients
to
write
to
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
how
conceivably
could
congress
make
the
--
the
activity
of
writing
this
letter
illegal?
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
of
the
record
are
you
reading
from?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
don't
have
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
in
the
wilkinson
record.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
yeagley,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
harvey
o'connor
was
known
to
the
committee
as
a
hard-core
member
of
the
communist
party.
perhaps
you've
already
told
us
about
that
but
is
--
does
the
record
in
the
hearing's
hearings'
main
evidence
reporting
on
statement.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
coe,
just
before
you
leave
that,
on
--
on
the
top
of
page
14
of
the
government's
brief,
there
is
quote,
mr.
arens'
--
part
of
mr.
arens'
statement
with
respect
to
one
of
these
questions.
mr.
arens
says
that,
harvey
o'connor
has
been
identified
as
a
hard-core
member
of
the
communist
conspiracy.
well,
of
course
we
know
that
--
the
record
shows
that
it
was
with
harvey
o'connor
that
this
petitioner
had
been
staying
just
before
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
just
before
coming
out
of
atlanta.
now,
is
there
anything
in
--
in
this
record
to
support
that
statement
of
identification
upon
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
just
what
i
--
that's
what
i
just
read.
justice
potter
stewart
no
--
no
i
don't
want
you
to
but
i
just
