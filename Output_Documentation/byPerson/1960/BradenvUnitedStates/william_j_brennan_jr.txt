do
you
believe

on
what
count
do
you
think
the

appeals
rested
its

justice
william
j.

on
what
counts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

one
and
three?
justice
william
j.

you
don't
think,
also

well,
was

was

justice
william

are
you
suggesting
that
(voice

based
in

well
mr.
yeagley,
do
you
think
that
it's
enough
for
a
foundation
of
reasonable
probable
cause
as
we
put
it?
i'm
speaking
about
this
record
now.
is
it
enough
that
counsel
merely
says
the
committee
has
information
which
we
think
that
justifies
our
belief
that
you're
a
communist,
therefore,
we
want
answers
these
questions,
is
that
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

without
disclosing
anything
at
all
or
what
this
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
this
is
because
you
think
there
is
enough
evidence
otherwise
to
support
