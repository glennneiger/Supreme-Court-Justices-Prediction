mr.
john
m.
coe
if
the
court
please?
mr.
john
m.
coe
mr.
justice.
let
me
state
if
i
understand
it
boldly,
the
position
of
the
government
as
to
these
questions
other
than
the
one,
the
count
5.
it
is
that
if
the
investigating
officer
or
committee
has
information
which
it
deemed
reliable,
the
directness
is
connected
with
the
communist
party
or
that
the
organization
being
investigated
has
such
connections,
that
he
may
--
that
they
may
proceed
to
ask
question
which
otherwise
would
be
barred
under
the
first
amendment.
this
court
has
with
great
care
in
the
barenblatt
decision
and
perhaps
some
others,
carved
out
a
narrow
exception,
where
first
amendment
rights
maybe
disregarded
in
the
interest
of
the
self-preservation
of
the
state.
if
the
government's
position
is
correct,
we
have
taken
an
enormous
leap
and
no
longer
do
we
have
the
control
which
is
implicit
in
the
barenblatt
and
other
opinions,
but
all
the
--
to
protect
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
witness,
but
the
government
can
come
in
and
say,
"we
suspect
you
and
we
suspect
your
organization
and
these
first
amendment
rights
vanish."
to
me,
that
is
equivalent
to
an
abolition
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
now,
let
us
see
what
has
been
the
history
of
that
question
before
this
court.
twice,
this
court
has
had
before
it,
once
it
decided
and
once
it
did
not.
the
question
of
the
right
to
interrogate
(voice
overlap)
an
individual
as
to
things
other
than
the
communist
party
--
in
--
the
one,
first
time
was
in
the
sweezy
case.
in
the
sweezy
case,
he
was
interrogated
at
certain
other
matters
that
quite
were
for
argument
here
there
was
interrogation
as
to
the
progressive
party.
on
page
265
of
the
report
of
that
--
of
--
of
the
opinion,
this
appears,
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion,
stating
of
what
the
court
the,
supreme
court
of
that
new
hampshire
had
said,
it
ruled
that
that
he
--
the
attorney
general,
did
posses
information
with
suspicion
to
reasonably
warrant
inquiry
and
citing
a
as
evident
to
the
statement
made
during
the
hearings
held
before
him
that
communists
--
that
considerable
sworn
testimony
had
been
given
in
this
investigation
to
the
effect
that
the
in
new
hampshire
had
been
heavily
infiltrated
by
members
of
the
communist
party
and
that
the
pauses
and
purposes
of
the
progressive
party
had
been
directly
influenced
by
members
of
the
communist
party.
i
need
not
repeat
to
this
court
what
it
decided
in
that
case.
it
decided
that
the
interrogation
of
the
witness
as
to
its
connection
with
the
progressive
party
was
impermissible,
notwithstanding
this
assertion
of
the
investigating
authority
that
it
had
this
information
and
notwithstanding
in
fact
the
state
court
(inaudible)
you
want
us
for
review,
had
found
judicially
that
he
had
that
thought.
the
other
time
in
which
the
question
of
outside
information
was
sought
to
be
held
to
justify
the
disregard
the
first
amendment
rights
was
in
barenblatt.
at
page
31
of
the
record
in
barenblatt,
i
got
from
the
library
of
the
court,
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
have
a
committee
investigator
testify
to
the
character
of
the
counsel
of
arts,
sciences
and
professions,
which
dealt
with
--
which
was
dealt
with
in
count
number
5
of
the
barenblatt
decision.
the
court
below
ruled
it
out
(inaudible)
but
finally
on
page
64
of
the
record,
the
--
the
evidence
got
in
that
the
witness
had
knowledge
of
the
counsel
of
the
arts,
sciences
and
profession
that
in
the
majority
of
its
officers
were
a
--
a
majority
of
officers
who
were
members
of
the
communist
party.
in
dealing
with
that,
your
honors
in
the
(inaudible)
case
upon
the
--
the
pertinency
and
importance
of
questions
1
and
2,
the
court
said
in
the
footnote
to
question
4
which
related
to
membership
in
the
haldane
club
of
the
communist
party,
was
also
to
the
basis
to
sustain
it,
but
the
court
specifically
failed
to
act
upon
the
question
where
barenblatt
was
asked
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
counsel
of
the
arts,
sciences
and
professions,
which
is
the
one
as
to
which
the
witness
had
said
that
it
was
--
that
the
majority
of
its
officers
were
member
of
the
communist
party.
sub
silentio
and
through
disregarding
count
number
5,
i
take
it
that
this
court
expressed
either
an
opinion
or
adopt
that
the
(inaudible)
utterance
of
a
gentleman
like
mr.
arens
who
appears
in
this
record,
that
he
had
cause
to
believe
was
not
sufficient
to
overthrow
the
rights
of
a
witness
to
normally
would
possess
them.
it
would
--
if
i
may
draw
a
comparison
from
a
practice
of
the
ordinary
criminal
law
in
which
i
generally
indulge,
it
would
be
just
as
though
a
member
of
the
alcohol
tax
unit
went
to
the
united
states
commissioner
and
says,
"mr.
commissioner,
i
have
cause
to
believe
that
john
smith
transports
whiskey,
give
me
a
search
warrant
to
know
what
happened
there."
so
i
submit
to
the
court
that
as
to
these
questions,
other
than
the
fifth
is
a
deal
or
dealt
with,
other
than
the
fifth
count,
that
there
is
no
basis
made
here
for
the
disregard
of
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
john
m.
coe
what
kind
of
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
now,
only
the
court
please,
the
statement
of
the
investigator
for
the
committee,
mr.
arens
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
your
honor
will
find
where
that
started
on
page
40
of
the
record.
i
will
not
--
unless
the
court
wished
they'd
consume
time.
mr.
john
m.
coe
you
mean
in
the
trial
of
the
case,
your
honor?
mr.
john
m.
coe
all
the
committee
members
and
the
chairman
made
elaborate
statements.
mr.
john
m.
coe
if
i
correctly
understand
your
honor's
question
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
that,
if
the
court
please,
i
can't
answer.
i
was
counsel
for
him
and
sat
beside
him.
mr.
john
m.
coe
but
i
--
i
just
don't
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
i
just
don't
remember.
mr.
john
m.
coe
then
if
the
court
please,
i
will
proceed
to
the
next
question
that
is
had
--
has
to
do
with
count
number
5
and
the
--
the
question,
"was
he
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
signed
this
letter
which
is
in
effect,
the
initiation
of
a
petition?
now,
as
have
said
by
--
suggested
by
one
of
the
justices,
this
was
not
official,
because
it's
a
dear
friend
letter,
asking
the
dear
friend
to
write
this
congressman,
but
it
is
a
far
of
the
right
of
petition
to
initiate
a
petition
and
in
order
to
initiate
a
petition,
you
may
--
you
must
reach
your
fellow
citizens
by
a
word
of
mouth
or
by
letter.
so
i
think
we
are
dealing
here
directly
with
the
question
of
the
right
for
petition.
mr.
john
m.
coe
it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
think
if
a
man
petitioned
congress
on
--
well,
and
now
perhaps,
i
spoke
a
little
patiently.
i
believe
i'm
happy
to
answer,
your
honor's
question,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
coe
it
--
it
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
no,
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
answer
that
question,
yes.
i
think
that
he
is
immunized
from
inquiry
as
to
the
exercise
of
his
right
of
petition.
mr.
john
m.
coe
i
am
inclined
to
think
he
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
coe
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
know
that
(inaudible)
mr.
john
m.
coe
i
realized
that's
the
one.
mr.
john
m.
coe
to
tell
you
the
truth
your
honor,
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
i
know
that
the
correct
practice
act
deals
with
approaching
people,
because
that
deals
with
social
money
under
certain
systematic
ways.
well,
that
had
been
dealt
with
--
i
--
in
two
cases,
one
of
which
i
believe
is
the
harris
case.
but
i
--
if
i
may
try
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
i
think
that
the
approach
of
this
citizen
to
his
government
is
something
which,
unless
it
takes
the
form
of
commercial
activity
or
unless
there's
something
else
in
the
statement
(inaudible)
or
rendered
dangerous,
they
cannot
be
regulated.
if
your
honor
will
bear
with
me
just
a
moment,
i'll
tell
you
why.
mr.
john
m.
coe
no,
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
if
you
are
hired
lobbyist
though,
getting
paid
for
it,
it
probably
would,
to
some
extent,
but
now,
if
--
if
i
may
proceed.
the
first
amendment
rights
have
always
been
an
argument
in
(inaudible)
first
amendment
rights
are
absolute
or
subject
to
regulation.
this
court
had
established
since
barenblatt
case
that
because
of
the
interest
of
the
government
in
self-preservation,
first
amendment
rights
as
to
assembly
and
other
activities,
speech
of
press
are
subject
to
regulation
under
circumstances.
a
committee
thereof
congress,
may
investigate
here
only
in
the
field
in
which
it
can
legislate.
you
may
legislate
against
the
exercise
of
the
first
amendment
rights
and
so
--
and
investigate
them
because
of
the
necessity
of
self-preservation
and
the
danger
of
the
overthrow
of
the
government,
a
--
an
assembly
may
become
a
howling
mob
and
assure
the
public
speech
a
new
--
newspapers
or
speeches
may
be
used
to
scare
people
up
to
do
damage
as
in
the
terminiello
case,
but
i
respectfully
ask
you
on,
how
are
you
going
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
by
petitioner
to
congress
and
if
the
communist
party
presents
it
all,
the
evil
attributes
which
are
attributed
to
it,
would
it
not
be
sound
public
policy
to
permit
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
means
to
achieve
that
purposes
rather
than
to
stigmatize
them
and
--
with
all
the
calm
which
as
we
all
know
problems
of
such
an
investigative
sense.
mr.
john
m.
coe
i
think
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
that
is
a
philosophical
question.
mr.
john
m.
coe
let
me
answer
you
--
your
honor's
question
this
way.
mr.
john
m.
coe
--
let
me
answer
your
honor's
question.
if
the
--
if
the
state
has
the
power
to
legislate
as
suppose
--
as
suppose,
of
course
it
course
have,
it
has
power
to
inquire
as
to
anything
that
deal
with
the
matter
of
legislation,
but
would
it
have
a
right
to
ask
me
what
did
i
put
in
the
first
class
letter
that
i
wrote
to
john
jones
in
new
york.
now,
that
brings
me
to
one
more
thing
and
--
and
it's
just
about
time
enough
to
mention
it.
if
the
--
the
question
as
the
membership
into
communist
party
are
not
to
asking
back
to
him,
they
are
asked
in
a
context
which
maybe
important
to
legislation
and
may
not
be.
if
you
ask
a
man
if
he
is
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
married
his
wife,
i
assume
that
court,
even
under
barenblatt's
second
decision,
would
hold
that
question
was
improper.
if
you
asked
him
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
received
the
shipment
of
machine
guns,
nobody
from
the
moron
would
hold
that
it
was
not
proper,
but
it
would
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
i
think
--
if
it
please
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
pertinent
but
when
you
asked
him
if
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
when
he
did,
pertinent
to
the
simple
proper
thing
that
you
and
i,
and
a
man
in
this
courtroom
could
do.
when
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
friend
and
asked
him
petition
--
petition
congress,
i
submit
they
are
stepping
beyond
the
(inaudible)
mr.
john
m.
coe
if
the
court
please,
we
approach
our
case
one
at
a
time
just
like
the
court
does
and
we
are
dealing
with
the
question
in
this
particular
way
--
mr.
john
m.
coe
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
it
was
because
you
can't
allow
petition
by
yourself
within
your
transcripts
(inaudible)
in
this
elaborate
society
of
ours.
you
have
got
to
see
your
neighbors,
you
have
got
to
get
your
neighbors
to
sign
and
you
frequently
use
the
post
office
to
write
your
mail.
mr.
john
m.
coe
that
is
possibly
true,
but
i
doubt
it,
your
honor.
with
that,
i
will
leave
it
with
the
court.
