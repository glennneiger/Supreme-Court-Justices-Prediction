mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
whereas,
it
has
been
the
interest
and
objective
of
counsel
for
petitioner
to
seek
to
tear
down
the
validity
and
the
purpose
of
the
committee
hearings
here
in
question,
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
government
of
course,
to
establish
the
good
faith
as
shown
by
the
record
and
the
validity
of
those
hearings
and
in
particular,
the
validity
of
at
least
one
count
of
the
indictment.
well,
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
there
are
five
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
as
in
that
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is
our
view
that
count
5,
is
clearly
proper,
valid
and
sustainable.
that
the
question
in
count
5
as
to
whether
or
not,
this
man
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
wrote
up
a
certain
letter,
is
almost
the
same
question
that
--
that
was
had
in
barenblatt,
as
to
whether
or
not,
barenblatt
was
a
member
of
the
haldane
club
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
attended
the
university
of
michigan.
now,
to
--
we're
not
abandoning
the
other
counts,
by
any
means.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
treat
with
count
5,
very
much
at
all.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that's
right.
and
i
am
--
i'm
clarifying
that
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
think
it
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
one
and
three.
i
believe
that
the
counts
that
the
court
of
appeals
discussed
and
principally
was
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that's
my
recollection.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
may
have
--
i
--
i'm
not
going
to
insist
on
my
own
statement
there
because
i
--
i
maybe
wrong
in
the
one
and
three.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
my
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it
was
not
five.
our
brief
here
in
the
supreme
court
is
largely
on
five
and
my
argument
knew
the
barenblatt
case
and
the
question
in
barenblatt,
i
would
like
to
devote
to
count
5
principally,
but
i
am
--
do
not
intend
of
enemy
of
the
counts
--
in
behalf
of
the
government.
one
reason
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
know
that
i
understood
his
question,
i
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
but
i
can
speak
my
own
position
is
that
we
are
not
abandoning
any
of
the
counts.
i
personally
would
rely
principally
on
count
5
in
this
argument,
as
the
brief
has
emphasized.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
right,
oh
well,
he
would
have
to
--
he
was
--
his
client
was
convicted
on
all
five
counts
and
he
would
have
the
burden
of
meeting
that.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
mr.
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
don't
recall
the
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
sufficiently
to
make
a
reference.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
that
court
said
anything
or
indicated
anything
to
raise
a
doubt
on
any
of
the
counts.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
as
far
as
making
--
i
meant
to
say
--
as
far
as
making
the
basing
their
holding,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
and
said
as
i
recall,
that
they
only
have
to
determine
whether
or
not,
some
particular
count
was
valid
and
sustainable
and
that
is
what
they
did
and
they
did
not
attempt
to
discuss
or
analyze
carefully
all
five
counts.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
although,
i
do
think,
they
referred
to
them.
they
didn't
base
the
whole
in
all
five
as
i
understand.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that's
right.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
i
would
like
to
reread
that
opinion
and
that
before
making
definite
answer
to
that's
sort
of
a
question,
it's
too
important
in
the
point
you
are
raising
in
that
like
the
basis
for
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes
and
it
--
and
it's
part
of
the
membership.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
pardon
me?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
the
letters
--
is
--
so
forth,
is
in
the
opinion.
i
know
but,
it's
--
it's
referred
to
the
--
i
didn't
understand
the
court
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
that
would
--
i
--
i
couldn't
answer
that
unless
i
knew
what
you
have
in
mind
now,
for
myself
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
--
if
i
may
--
i
would
answer
that
yes,
if
i
will
make
a
statement
first
in
--
in
reference
to
this
whole
subject
matter
why,
i'm
emphasizing
count
5
and
i
think,
it
may
a
bearing
on
the
question
you
are
answering
--
asking
mr.
justice
black.
our
position
here
is,
this
committee
was
not
investigating
integration
or
any
other
unrelated
problem
such
as
added,
as
it's
stated
in
its
resolution
and
as
it
was
stated
committee
hearings
was
investigating
communist
activities,
it
was
investigating
communist
infiltration
on
the
south,
it
was
investigating
communist
propaganda
in
the
south.
it
had
information
through
a
testimony
of
mrs.
ahearn,
who
had
appeared
and
before
the
internal
security
committee,
under
oath,
that
this
man
braden
and
his
wife
are
members
of
the
communist
party
and
had
for
some
years
and
recruited
her
into
the
party.
it
had
information
according
to
the
--
this
record
here
that
mr.
braden
at
this
time,
had
been
traveling
through
the
south,
in
the
interest
of
communist
activities
and
spreading
communist
propaganda,
advising
that
they
had
evidence
that
he
had
just
travelled
to
atlanta
and
to
new
orleans,
before
going
up
to
meet
mr.
o'connor
in
the
interest
of
communist
activities.
i
think
the
whole
tenure
of
the
hearings,
if
you
will
read
it
despite
particular
witnesses
that
mr.
boudin
has
pointed
out,
the
whole
tenure
of
the
hearing
is
that
they
--
and
from
the
type
of
witnesses
they
have
subpoenaed,
by
enlarge
as
that
they
were
investigating,
trying
to
get
information
on
what
the
communist
interest
in
this
area
and
this
matters
were.
what
was
the
propaganda
that
this
particular
man
who
was
a
writer,
was
dispensing
in
the
south?
they
were
trying
to
determine
from
him
as
a
communist,
what
techniques
were
and
this
was
mentioned
at
the
hearing
likewise
and
this
--
because
of
this
purpose
of
the
committee
as
we
see
it,
the
investigation
of
communism,
the
investigation
of
this
through
--
a
person
believed
by
then
to
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
we
felt
that
this
was
clearly
within
barenblatt,
it
was
clearly
within
the
same
question
and
barenblatt
regarding
whether
or
not,
he
was
a
member
of
the
haldane
club
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
he
was
up
at
the
university
of
michigan.
here,
the
question
was,
“were
you
a
member
of
the
party
at
the
time
you
wrote
this
letter?”
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
oh,
i
--
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
fail
to
--
to
see
that.
they
were
asking
him
about
his
party
membership,
they
related
it
to
a
time
of
when
he
signed
the
letter.
number
one,
i
interpreted
that
to
mean
and
he
was
trying
to
avoid
the
question
of
generally,
were
you
a
member
of
the
communist
party?
he
wants
to
pinpoint
now
--
or
within
the
immediate
time
--
trying
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
he
showed
to
pinpoint
i
assume,
in
reference
to
this
letter,
because
they
were
investigating
communist
party
propaganda,
techniques
and
activities.
if
as
he
believed,
this
witness
was
a
communist
and
if
he
was
writing
a
letter
--
this
was
the
“dear
friend”
letter,
i
believe
mr.
justice
stewart,
not
the
other
letter,
he
was
trying
to
get
other
people
to
write
the
congress
regarding
legislation,
this
one?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
if
you
want
to
--
if
you
want
to
know
if
this
man
who
did,
this
was
a
communist.
the
court
has
clearly
recognized
it
in
many
cases,
the
nexus
between
communism
and
the
overthrow
of
government
and
the
–
right
of
the
government
to
defend
itself.
it's
the
government's
position
--
this
question
is
the
same
question
in
essence
as
was
involved
in
barenblatt.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
no
sir,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
certainly,
that's
a
broader
question,
i
certainly
could
not
say
that
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
oh,
i
just
certainly
don't
think
so.
i
believe
i
can
point
out
some
differences
if
i
may.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
first
of
all,
this
letter
was
not
directed
to
any
congressman
or
any
senator.
this
was
a
dear
friend
letter,
widely
circulated
asking
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
committee
was
apparently
considering
this
communist
propaganda.
they
were
trying
to
get
a
move
on
going
for
someone
else
to
write
to
congress.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
in
--
i
might
have
to
answer
that,
yes,
it's
a
hypothetical
--
you
have
to
know
all
the
circumstances.
here,
i
must
say,
yes,
because
this
man,
the
committee
believed
not
only
he
was
a
communist,
but
he
occupied
positions
in
which
he
could
exert
considerable
influence
on
public
opinion.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
his
--
previously
he
had
been
a
writer
for
newspapers.
he
was
submitting
material
to
the
southern
newsletter,
which
had
a
circulation,
now,
enlarging
with
the
circulation
through
the
south
of
some
2600,
i
believe
the
record
showed.
and
he
was
a
--
an
officer,
a
field
officer
of
this
particular
organization,
that
he
was
then
traveling
for
allegedly
in
the
--
in
the
south
from
atlanta
to
new
orleans.
and
the
committee's
information
was,
according
to
their
statement
in
the
record,
that
he
was
doing
this
to
advance
communist
objectives.
now
this
record
doesn't
show
that
this
committee
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
an
offense?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
oh,
that's
not
an
offense,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
indeed.
i
don't
understand
that
this
committee
is
saying
that
this
people
can't
write
his
letters.
i
think
what
the
committee's
effort
is
aimed
toward
--
towards
masquerading
who's
behind
this?
is
it
the
communist
group
behind
or
not?
if
not,
final
(inaudible)
for
there's
the
committee
who
had
an
interest.
i
think
it's
something
like
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
if
the
act
itself
was
legitimate?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
don't
understand
that
the
committee
is
restricted
to
investigating
acts
that
are
criminal
in
the
--
in
and
of
themselves
or
by
themselves.
i
think
the
investigative
power
of
a
congressional
committee,
if
it
has
valid
authorizing
resolution
of
as
conducted
in
its
hearing
otherwise,
proper,
their
authority
to
investigate,
i
believe,
is
slightly
larger
leaps
that
as
the
court
have
said
and
then
there
authority
to
legislate
them
and
investigate
a
little
bit
beyond
that.
they
don't
have
to
investigate
merely
a
crime
i
don't
believe.
i
believe
that
the
committee
is
entitled
to
investigate
and
gather
as
they
say
a
fund
of
information
on
communism,
so
they
can
decide
whether
they
need
to
recommend
more
legislation
that
might
make
have
some
or
part
of
these
activities
illegal.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
don't
think
that
--
in
this
instance
they
--
they
could,
but
i
think
that
if
they're
going
to
treat
in
terms
of
communist
party
propaganda,
the
registration
of
propaganda
agents,
if
they're
going
to
think
in
terms
of
that
and
the
resolution
specifically
mentioned
propaganda
activities,
they
have
to
know
what
propaganda
--
communist
propaganda
is
and
what
--
is
not
communist
propaganda.
they
have
to
know
who
are
the
principal
ones
doing
it
and
how
they
do
it.
what
techniques
they're
using
and
what
their
particular
objectives
are
i
believe
and
i
think
that
it
isn't
the
question
of
whether
the
writing
of
the
letter
is
illegal
or
whether
they
might
consider
it
illegal.
i
just
don't
--
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
say
from
my
--
my
own
part
for
a
moment
that
we
want
to
stop
people
from
writing
letters
to
anyone,
but
as
the
question
of
when
it's
an
organized
group
if
it
is,
who's
behind
it?
who's
masquerading?
as
is
has
been
said
in
the
decision
on
the
lobbying
in
that
case,
which
should
not
involve
communism,
but
which
involved
the
harris
case,
involved
the
interest
of
congress
in
knowing
who
is
attempting
to
influence
legislation
and
congressmen,
it
was
recognizing
both
majority
and
minority
opinions
there,
that
the
congress
has
a
right
to
find
out
who
is
the
masquerading
and
who
is
--
who
are
the
agents
and
who
are
the
principals
more
or
less.
if
someone's
trying
to
influence
legislation
but
he's
doing
and
for
another
group,
for
another
cause,
in
the
lobbying
instance,
the
--
the
court
there
at
least
has
recognized
that
that's
a
valid
congressional
interest
and
not
that
the
action
is
illegal
or
wrong
at
all.
it's
a
matter
of
information
that
the
congress
conceivably
should
have.
i
certainly
don't
want
to
contend
that
people
should
not
have
freedoms
to
write,
to
talk
and
speak.
when
we
get
into
the
area
of
communism
and
the
overthrow
of
government
however
and
it
passed
the
question
of
masquerading
or
using
agents
representing
others
and
who's
doing
what,
for
what
purpose,
if
the
congress
is
going
to
have
the
authority
to
legislate
in
this
area
and
the
authority
that
has
been
recognized
in
the
certain
instances
of
investigating
in
this
area,
it
must
have
the
authority
to
get
this
kind
of
information,
the
government
believes,
at
least,
but
not
to
say
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
--
i've
had
to
find
the
valid
legislative
purpose
in
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
some
place
and
just
the
fact
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
that
you
wrote
the
letter
would
not
to
me,
give
that,
no.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it
seems
to
me,
they
must
establish
a
valid
legislative
interest
or
purpose
first
and
now
here
that
purpose
was
to
determine
that
this
was
communist-inspired.
this
is
the
part
of
the
communist
party
program,
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
think
that
the
--
that
in
that
case,
the
court
might
want
to
concern
itself
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
they
felt
that
the
committee
conducting
the
inquiry
had
reasonable
or
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
witness
could
furnish
the
information
they
were
looking
for
or
whether
or
not,
they
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
as
in
this
case,
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party
that
supplied
this
information
on
communist
techniques
in
this
area.
i
don't
think
that
they
could
just
go
on
and
ask
anyone
these
questions
without
for
lack
of
a
better
expression.
well,
i
would
say,
a
valid
legislative
purpose
here
that
it
has
to
be
--
their
belief,
this
man
is
a
communist,
as
we
see
it.
if
that's
out
of
--
of
the
question
then
he'd
have
to
know
the
facts
at
least,
i
would
see
what
legislative
purpose
did
they
have?
it
would
have
to
be
more
than
that
and
in
this
particular
instance,
the
committee
tried
to
show
that
it
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
people
subpoenaed
to
this
three-day
--
three-day
hearings,
were
in
fact,
communist.
at
one
point,
congressman
jackson
asked
a
witness,
are
you
always
witnessed
communist
and
he
said
i
leave
that
to
you,
sir.
as
it
turned
out,
one
witness
i
recall,
said
that
he
wasn't
a
communist,
he
denied
it
and
they
didn't
harass
him,
they
didn't
give
him
a
great
deal
of
trouble,
as
i
recall
it.
apparently
except
to
that
for
--
what
he
had
said,
they
asked
him
other
questions
and
let
it
go.
and
that's
the
case,
mr.
braden
had
several
case
in
the
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
they
indicate
--
the
indication
--
two
or
three
places
in
their
hearing
that
the
committee
will
see
the
opinion
of
these
other
people
subpoenaed,
were
communists
and
that
they
had
information
to
that
effect.
i
think
peina
had
testified
that
regarding
one
or
two
of
them
and
they
indicated
they
had
other
information
on
some
of
the
other
witnesses.
i'm
not
able
to
pinpoint
that
now,
but
i
believe,
i
can
from
the
record.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
some
of
the
witnesses
for
example,
were
on
the
other
point
of
the
legislative
inquiry,
a
member
of
the
resolution
authorizing
to
investigate
infiltration
of
colligation
under
the
industries
or
communist
propaganda.
on
the
industry
side,
the
witnesses
have
been
subpoenaed.
they
had
informations
that
they
were
communist.
in
most
instance
they
were
either
college
trained
or
college
graduates
and
one
or
two
are
masters
and
they
were
trying
to
bring
out
that
these
people
were
not
working
at
their
trade
or
their
education,
they
were
taking
laboring
jobs,
much
lower
pay
jobs,
in
order
to
file
the
communist
party
program
of
infiltrating
the
south
and
the
growth
of
industry
in
the
south.
these
people
however,
for
the
most
part,
didn't
answer
questions
regarding
the
communist
party
membership
either.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
as
one,
it's
not
a
great
deal
that
comes
out
in
this
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
for
example,
i
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
deny
the
accuracy
of
the
testimony
of
mrs.
alberta
ahearn
before
another
committee
regarding
his
party
membership
and
he
declined
to
take
the
opportunity
to
comment
on
that.
and
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
but
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it
is
not
before
--
it
was
--
it
was
not,
the
testimony
taken
at
this
hearings,
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
would
think
so.
the
question
of
--
of
probable
cause
is
a
matter
that
can't
be
established
by
--
by
hearsay
as
far
as
invading
the
right
of
privacy
of
person
in
his
home
for
the
search
warrant,
can
be
based
on
hearsay.
here,
this
committee
of
the
counsel
had
worked
for
the
other
committee
at
another
time.
the
committee
had
access
to
the
records
of
the
testimony
of
the
other
committee.
the
--
the
witness
himself
was
the
one
brought
up,
they
conduct
this
sedition
trail,
where
he
had
been
charged
under
the
kentucky
law
and
the
conviction
was
reversed
because
of
nelson
versus
pennsylvania.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
--
the
committee
had
that
information
on
that
record
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
related
to
the
communism,
yes.
the
--
i
cannot
say
the
issue
was
not
whether
he
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party.
the
kentucky
indictment
contained
live
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
not
entirely,
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
indictment
contained
language
--
i
can't
expect
to
recall
it
too
accurately
but
it
contained
language
to
the
effect
that
he
was
charged
with
having
destroyed
property
there
was
the
explosion,
destroyed
his
house
that
he
had
built
or
that
he
had
help
the
(inaudible)
occupy.
he
had
destroyed
--
properties
for
--
for
obtaining
the
political
end
and
then
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
indictment
didn't
specify,
but
according
to
other
information,
it
was
the
explosion
in
the
house
--
the
house
had
been
bombed.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
this
house
had
been
bombed
or
dynamite
gone
off
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
in
the
case
--
course
of
this
addition
indictment,
in
addition
to
the
charge
of
--
of
the
sedition
of
advocating,
they
also
can
set
forth
the
paragraph
stating
in
essence
that
he
had
destroyed
a
property
in
order
to
attain
a
political
end.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i'm
not
quite
clear
--
one
he
had
bought
with
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
whether
he
had
title
in
or
whether
the
(inaudible)
had
title,
i'm
not
sure,
pardon?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
oh,
that's
--
that
was
the
circumstance
that
was
not
on
the
charge,
i
don't
believe.
he
had
bought
the
house.
he
had
either
rented
it
or
sold
to
the
wage
who
i
believe
were
colored
people
and
l
believe
two
or
three
weeks
time
had
passed
as
some
strike
of
and
on
and
sometimes
it
was
quite
bit
in
sometimes
not.
and
one
night,
there
was
an
explosion
in
the
basement
of
the
house
and
the
north
part
of
the
house
i
believe,
the
west
part
was
partially
destroyed.
i
don't
who
owned
it
at
that
time
and
then
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
would
say,
he
probably
still
owned
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
but
it
was
reversed
on
nelson
versus
(voice
overlap)
the
nelson
wasn't
decided
until
later
and
it
was
decided
before
the
case
reached
--
reached
the
kentucky
supreme
court
and
the
kentucky
supreme
court
reversed
it
based
on
nelson
as
having
preempted
it.
the
charge
had
not
been
restricted
to
sedition
against
kentucky.
they
have
based
in
that
--
in
our
sedition
against
kentucky
and
the
united
states
of
america
and
the
supreme
court
reversed
for
that
reason.
but
that
doesn't
have
a
direct
bearing
on
this
case
other
than
that
--
on
probable
cause
this
committee,
the
members
knew
some
of
the
testimony
regarding
braden
at
that
hearing,
again
where
mrs.
alberta
ahearn
had
testified
that
he
had
recruited
her
into
the
party.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
approach
it
from
the
other
side
and
say
that
if
they
don't
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
witness
has
information
useful
and
helpful
to
the
committee
in
an
area
of
a
valid
legislative
purpose,
i
think,
should
not
call
the
witness.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
this
has
been
discussed
in
earlier
cases.
i
don't
recall
whether
it
was
watkins
or
--
or
barenblatt,
but
it
--
there
must
of
course
be
a
--
a
reasonable
ground
for
the
committee
to
believe
that
this
man
is
going
to
be
helpful
in
a
valid
area.
otherwise,
they'll
be
using
the
so-called
dragnet
procedures
of
just
calling
in
anyone
and
that's
one
point
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
here.
they
did
not
call
in
the
board
of
directors
of
any
of
these
organizations
that
have
been
mentioned
of
it.
they
did
not
call
in
the
members
of
the
other
officers.
they,
based
on
this
record,
we're
attempting
to
call
in
the
ones
upon
whom
they
had
enough
information
to
feel
that
they
were
going
to
feel
that
given
information
about
communist
activities
in
these
areas.
that's
why
we
say
that
the
committee
was
not
investigating
immigration
and
doesn't
call
that
kind
of
a
witness.
they
called
--just
who
they
thought
we're
|communist
and
--
and
who,
under
the
resolution
of
the
parent
committee
that
could
give
a
testimony
regarding
communist
colonization
or
infiltration
in
basic
industry
or
who
could
give
testimony
in
communist
propaganda
in
the
south.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
i
believe
so,
if
we're
going
to
give
good
faith,
we'd
better
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
--
i
--
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
would
say
yes,
with
the
reservation.
as
some
would
think,
we're
going
to
get
good
faith
and
credit
one
government
agency
or
official
to
another,
which
i
think
we
--
we
must
do
if
a
--
a
question
is
raised
on
this
by
the
witness'
counsel
or
by
the
witness,
you
might
get
into
a
different
situation.
i'm
not
prepared
to
try
to
resolve
now.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
committee
feels
and
if
when
you
say
to
the
counsel
was
doing
interrogating,
i
--
my
position
on
that
is
that
he
can't
do
this
unless
the
committee
knows
what
he's
doing
and
approved
it.
if
he
is
saying,
we
have
information,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
the
committee
is
satisfied
that
they
do
that
and
if
the
witness
wants
it
specified
or
spelled
out,
it
poses
the
question
i
have
gone
into,
i
appreciate
the
point
you're
making,
there's
a
bit
point
i
would
want
to
try.
it's
not
in
this
case
here,
i
don't
believe.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
there
has
been
evidence
on
--
at
least
we
know
it
was
under
oath
in
one
instance
before
our
court
had
a
chance
to
evaluate
mrs.
ahearn,
she
again,
was
before
a
committee
and
congress
that
had
a
chance
to
evaluate.
it
was
introduced
in
writing
by
a
court
reporter.
in
other
words,
there's
more
than
just
information
that
may
have
been
brought
in
by
another
unidentified
source.
its
evidence,
it
is
printed,
it's
under
oath
and
it
has
been
evaluated
at
least
by
someone.
in
this
case
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes.
the
runway
case,
as
i
recall
was
in
regarding
the
investigation
of
lobbying
activities
and
the
resolution
there,
i
don't
know
the
wording,
but
it
was
related
to
lobbying
with
congressmen
or
something
like
that.
and
as
i
recall,
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
felt
that
the
language
of
the
resolution
was
so
specific
that
the
congress
had
intended
the
committee
to
restrict
its
investigation
to
lobbying
with
congressmen,
context
with
congressmen
and
the
facts
in
the
runway
case
involved
as
i
believe,
a
committee
that
--
its
operation
had
been
opposed
to
some
of
the
legislation
and
--
and
there'd
some
book
sales
and
purchases
of
books
to
this
committee
and
the
material
in
the
books
dealt
apparently
with
some
of
the
legislation
pending
and
the
question
involved
on
the
production
of
these
books
do
not,
in
any
way
involve
anyone's
direct
contact
with
a
congressman
or
senator
or
any
direct
lobbying.
and
i
believe
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
valid
legislative
purpose
in
asking
this
question.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
i
don't
recall
it
now.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
have
it,
sir,
but
i
do
not
have
it
here
and
i
don't
recall
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i'm
sorry
that
i
don't
have
(inaudible)
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
was
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
we
don't
have
any
thing
like
that
and
i
believe
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
yes,
i
know
there
have
been
instances.
i
don't
have
any
immediate
reference
to
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
language
isn't
quite
that
way.
i
don't
have
really
records
but
here's
what
happened
is
that
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
this
is,
i
believe,
leonard
may
have
it.
this
is
the
wilkinson
indictment,
mr.
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
219.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
here's
the
other
--
the
sentence
in
the
other
case.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
and
if
--
though
i
don't
want
to
indulge
too
much
at
mr.
marensey's
argument,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
can
point
out
that
he
had
come
into
town
in
atlanta
and
he
had
been
subpoenaed
on
that
occasion.
and
he
happen
to
have
been
the
person
who
had
been
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that's
the
other
case.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
it
was
not
just
in
that
random
arbitrary
subpoena
of
mr.
wilkinson.
he
has
been
identified
in
the
hearings
previously
by
--
i
should
not
say
previously
i'm
not
--
by
mr.
peina
that
mr.
boudin
referred
to
as
having
testified
at
an
earlier
hearing
as
well
as
of
this
hearing
and
i
believe
that
he's
the
one
who
identified
mr.
wilkinson
as
a
--
an
active
member
of
the
communist
party.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
wilkinson
record
and
i
would
not
want
to
get
in
that
too
much,
if
it's
alright
in
here.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
boudin
said
that
peina
did
not
identify
him
in
this
record.
mr.
marensey
can
answer
that,
i
know
he
was
identified
as
a
communist
before
he
was
subpoenaed.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i'd
like
to
point
out
unlike
the
watkins
case
here,
the
--
in
additional
to
rule
11,
the
parent
committee,
the
house
un-american
activities
committee,
specifically
adopted
the
resolution
and
spelled
out
the
legislative
purpose
that
they
had
in
mind
and
the
things
that
they
wanted
this
committee
to
investigate
when
they
went
to
atlanta,
it
authorized
specifically
hearings
in
atlanta.
the
pertinent
part
where
they
had
in
mind,
stated
that
the
committee
was
accumulating
--
pardon
me,
i
got
the
wrong
one.
they
want
to
conduct
an
investigation
in
atlanta
relating
to
the
extent,
character
and
objects
of
communist
colonization
and
infiltration
into
the
textile
and
other
basic
industries
in
the
south
land
and
communist
party
propaganda
activities
in
the
south.
the
resolution
went
on
beyond
that
but
those
two
things
seem
to
be
clear
as
far
as
most
of
these
witnesses
were
concerned,
a
rather
express
authorization
by
the
parent
committee
and
this
was
elaborated
on
to
some
extent
by
chairman
willis
beginning
of
the
hearing.
now,
mr.
braden,
we
can't
show
who
was
present
when
walter
testified,
nonetheless,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
--
of
pertinent
not
to
say
and
i
think
wilkinson
was
present.
and
willis
explained
at
some
length,
their
legislative
interest
in
the
bills
they
had
pending
on
congress,
why
they
wanted
to
get
into
this
communist
propaganda
and
techniques
and
he
said
that
the
committee
was
accumulating
factual
information
respecting
communists,
the
communist
party
and
communist
activities
which
will
enable
the
committee
and
the
congress
to
appraise
the
administration
and
operation
of
the
smith
act,
the
internal
security
act
of
1950,
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
and
numerous
provisions
of
the
criminal
code
relating
to
espionage,
sabotage
and
subversion.
in
addition
--
in
addition
to
the
committee
as
before,
numerous
proposals
to
strengthen
the
--
or
legislative
weapon
designed
to
protect
the
internal
security
of
the
nation.
his
statement
actually
was
in
many
pages
long
and
then
during
the
hearing,
when
the
witness
or
witnesses
did
not
answer
the
question
in
a
--
in
apprising
the
witnesses
of
the
pertinency,
mr.
arens
and
sometimes
congressman
jackson
and
chairman
willis
would
explain
at
some
length,
the
committee's
feeling
why
these
questions
were
pertinent.
now,
there's
been
some
issue
raised
as
to
whether
not,
the
man
was
advised.
at
least
he
has
insisted
all
the
way
through
in
his
answers
in
not
answering
most
of
the
questions
that
there
was
no
valid
legislative
purpose
that
the
mandate
of
the
committee
is
vague
and
that
he
did
not
feel
that
he
had
to
answer
any
of
these
questions,
this
is
i
believe
the
reason
mr.
boudin
points
out
that
the
man
was
relying
or
watkins
and
should
have
some
protection
there.
the
care
of
which
they
did
discuss
with
him,
advised
him
of
pertinency
may
be
of
some
of
interest
here,
if
i
can
locate
it.
mr.
arens
said
on
first
occasion
when
mr.
braden
refused
to
answer
her
question,
“sir,
it
is
our
understanding
that
you
are
a
communist?"
you
see
all
the
way
through
the
hearing,
they're
trying
to
base
their
questions
on
communism,
communist
activities
and
very
often,
the
committee
chairman
and
--
and
congressman
jackson
said,
we
don't
care
about
your
opinions.
we're
not
investigating
immigration.
we're
investigating
communist
and
communist
activities.
you
are
now
a
communist,
a
member
the
communist
party,
that
you
have
been
identified
by
reputable,
responsible
witnesses
under
oath,
as
a
communist.
part
of
the
communist
party
which
is
tentacle
of
international
communist
conspiracy,
it
is
our
information
further,
sir,
that
you
as
a
communist,
had
been
propagating
on
a
communist
activity
in
the
communist
line
principally
in
the
south,
that
you
have
been
masquerading
behind
the
facade
of
humanitarianism
that
you
have
been
masquerading
behind
the
facade
of
emotional
appeal
to
certain
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
have
--
it's
2669
of
the
--
committee
print,
which
is
case
number
--
i'm
sorry
i
won't
be
on
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it's
in
the
record.
i
don't
have
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
in
the
wilkinson
record,
the
committee
print
is
inserted
and
the
committee
case
number
is
2669.
"that
you
have
been
masquerading
behind
this
façade
of
emotional
appeal
to
certain
segments
of
our
society,
that
your
purpose,
objective,
your
activities
are
designed
to
further
the
cause
of
the
international
communist
conspiracy
in
the
united
states."
he
went
on
and
explained
pertinency
further
to
--
explained
to
the
witness
that
they
had
these
legislative
proposals
under
the
consideration
that
were
draft
--
drafted.
they
might
have
others
to
prepare
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
this
was
the
counsel
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
this
was
the
counsel
of
committee
in
mr.
arens
who
was
asking
the
questions
at
this
time.
it
only
added
after
explaining
the
legislative
considerations
that
they
had
and
mr.
arens
said,
“it
is
for
that
reason
and
for
these
reasons
which
i
just
describe
to
you
that
this
committee
has
come
to
atlanta,
georgia
for
the
purpose
of
assembling
factual
material
which
the
committee
can
use
in
connection
with
other
materials,
which
it
has
assembled
and
apprising
--
in
appraising
the
administration
the
opera
--
an
operation
of
the
laws
and
in
making
a
studied
judgment
upon
whether
or
not,
the
current
provisions
of
the
laws
are
adequate
and
whether
or
not,
each
or
any
of
these
proposals
pending
before
the
committee,
should
be
recommended
for
enactment.
now
shortly
thereafter,
at
another
point
in
the
question
about
one
page
or
after
that,
mr.
arens
said
that
he
wanted
the
record
to
be
absolutely
clear,
that
the
explanation
that
he
gave
to
the
witness
as
to
the
pertinency
of
the
question
on
the
first
occasion,
is
understood
that
the
applicable
to
similar
questions,
which
he
intended
to
propose
to
the
witness,
later
on.
the
reason
i
mentioned
this
is
that
as
you
go
through
the
record,
you
will
notice
that
on
many
occasions,
there
was
no
detailed
reason
why
the
witness
was
objecting
and
no
detailed
explanation
of
pertinency
and
no
direction
to
answer.
the
reason
is
that
through
a
series
of
pages,
they
finally
agreed
with
the
witness
and
his
counsel
and
the
one
doing
interrogating
and
the
committee
chairman,
that
it
wouldn't
be
necessary.
he
asked
and
the
witness
said,
“do
i
have
to
list
all
of
these
every
time
i
object”
and
they
said
no
and
the
counsel,
well,
we're
going
to
arrange
that.
i
would
like
to
have
it
understood
that
the
statement
of
pertinency
that
we
have
given
before
and
they
had
done
it
two
or
three
times,
is
going
to
be
applicable
to
all
of
these
future
questions.
and
that
the
committee
does
not
accept
the
witnesses'
grounds
upon
which
his
reason
to
answer
and
that
the
committee
expects
an
answer
and
on
two
occasions,
he
said,
i
understand.
on
the
second
occasion,
he
had
it,
i
understand
what
my
counsel
understands
and
he
had
two
lawyers
there
with
him.
i
mentioned
that
because
i
know
you'll
(inaudible)
there
in
going
through
the
record.
on
the
fifth
question
for
example,
there
was
no
direction
to
answer.
this
has
been
done
in
reference
to
other
questions.
it
has
been
done
as
a
part
of
this
arrangement
they
have
between
witness
and
counsel.
i
can
go
on
to
that
in
detail.
if
there's
a
--
a
question
i
think
that
it
would
be
binding
now,
on
--
on
the
witness
under
the
--
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
correct.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that's
right
--
or
he
would
just
say,
i
refuse
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
the
first
amendment,
we
--
under
the
arrangement
understand
that
he
is
meaning
that
he's
challenging
the
--
the
authority
of
the
committee's
challenge
rule
11.
he's
--
he
has
relied
on
all
the
objections
that
he
earlier
stated.
we
apply
all
those
objections
to
each
of
the
questions,
regardless
of
whether
he
enumerated
them,
that's
right,
the
government
takes
that
position.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
don't
believe
so
unless
peina
again
would
have
--
would
have
been
the
witness
who
identified
that
o'connor.
i
don't
recall,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
basis
for
the
identity
of
o'connor.
other
than,
i
know
the
committee
stated
at
the
hearing
that
they
had
reliable
information
that
he
was
a
member,
so
it
must
be
the
party
to
have
that.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
is
testimony
at
this
particular
hearing.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
--
i'm
afraid
that
i'm
not
the
one
to
answer
that,
i
know,
you
mean
mr.
fishman?
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
fishman
is
the
one
that
testified
7
to
12
times
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
mr.
boudin,
said
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
have
not
checked
on
that,
but
i
would
take
mr.
boudin's
word
on
that.
mr.
fishman
is
employed
by
the
bureau
of
customs
and
has
something
to
do
with
the
--
this
--
determine
the
amount
of
communist
propaganda
coming
into
this
country
from
abroad,
particularly
from
behind
the
iron
curtain,
what
the
volume
is
and
things
of
that
kind.
and
i
know
that
he
has
testified
before
committees
of
--
of
congress
on
many
--
many
occasions.
i
know
in
some
instances,
their
purpose
is
to
show
the
volume
on
foreign
agent's
registration
act,
of
coming
in
and
the
requirements
for
labelling
that
is
not
label
that
it
should
be
and
what
the
damage
might
be
to
an
unlabeled
propaganda
coming
in
from
abroad.
i
believe
that
his
testimony
in
this
occasion
was
the
longest
--
this
line.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
was
mr.
peina.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
i
don't
know
that
boston
circumstance
and
why
he
was
in
boston.
i
think
i
do
understand
why
he
was
here
at
this
hearing.
the
witness,
peina,
had
testified
that
he
had
been
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
been
placed
on
the
national
textile
commission,
they
call
it,
of
the
communist
party,
it
could
more
or
less,
i
think
i'd
be
right
in
saying
that
it's
a
secretly,
semi-secret
group
in
the
party
whose
function
was
to
sponsor
this
colonization
and
claiming
forth
an
infiltration
of
the
--
the
developing
textile
industry
in
the
south.
after
he
had
served
on
this
textile
commission
of
the
communist
party
for
some
time,
he
had
left
the
party
and
he
isn't,
at
least
in
this
atlanta
hearing,
testifying
to
his
knowledge
as
a
member
of
the
national
textile
commission
of
the
communist
party,
as
to
a
party
policy
that
there
was
such
a
policy
of
infiltration
down
there.
that
it
was
new
in
the
last
two
or
three
years,
i
believe.
that
it
wasn't
new,
if
it
is
being
emphasized
in
the
last
or
three
years.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
that
he
testified
to
some
length.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
have
not
read
this
boston
testimony
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
i'm
sorry
i'm
not
familiar
with
it
at
all.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
it's
my
first
time
to
hear
about
it.
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
i
know
that
mr.
fishman
has
--
has
testified
with
him.
i
don't
know
how
--
how
often.
i
did
not
know
that
mr.
peina
had
testified
in
more
than
once.
i
can't
think
of
other
examples.
i
think
there
has
been
but
i
--
i
can't
name
any
examples,
i
think
that
they
have
had
a
witness
appear
more
than
one
time
and
i
assume
perhaps
in
different
localities.
we
--
i'm
not
--
i
haven't
studied
the
operation
of
this
committee
anymore
than
the
average
person
may
have.
it
isn't
our
purpose
to
try
to
defend
all
of
the
actions
of
this
or
any
other
committee
anymore
than
we
tried
it
on
the
actions
of
the
department
of
defense
or
state,
when
we
represented
them
in
a
--
on
a
suit
in
civil
action.
well,
in
this
case,
the
government's
interest
is
in
--
is
in
sustaining
the
validity
of
the
legislative
purpose
thereof
the
rule
11
as
applied
here
under
house
--
resolution
that
was
adopted
on
may
21st
of
1958
and
then
particularly,
of
sustaining
the
validity
of
the
conviction
on
this
indictment
in
the
five
questions.
beyond
that,
we
--
we
don't
feel
that
we
should
be
prepared
with
to
completely
defend
all
of
the
actions
of
--
you
might
say
is
our
client,
nor
to
condemn
them
of
their
actions
either.
now,
you
must
pardon
me,
if
i
have
not
made
my
argument
in
sequence
and
i've
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
--
trying
--
trying
to
answer
the
--
mr.
j.
walter
yeagley
the
question
is
nice
--
i
may
--
well,
i
frankly
feel
that
this
is
a
case
where
that
serves
a
better
purpose
on
the
--
than
me
trying
to
(inaudible).
one
point
that
perhaps
we
haven't
covered
that
i
don't
need
to
believe
needs
covering
in
great
details,
covered
in
our
brief
and
you
are
all
very
familiar
with
it,
this
is
a
question
of
the
first
amendment.
i
know
that
you've
all
examined
it
carefully
and
discussed
it
and
written
out
in
the
barenblatt
case.
this
is
a
question
apparently,
as
we
see
it
or
weigh
in
the
interest
of
the
government
against
the
interest
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
to
have
these
constitutional
rights
protected
and
not
unduly
abridged.
we
believe
that
in
this
instance
and
that
with
the
rule
11
and
the
authorizing
resolution
of
the
house
and
the
statement
of
the
committee
chairman
and
the
general
conduct
of
the
committee
in
advising
the
witnesses
here
and
the
purpose
--
the
actual
purpose
of
trying
to
get
to
this
communist
conspiracy
and
to
stand
away
from
the
dragnet
procedures
and
bring
in
integration
as
of
in
charge
which
didn't
happen
though,
subpoena
those
they
thought
we're
communist.
we
believe
that
they
have
been
pursuing
a
valid
legislative
purpose
as
recognized
by
this
court
and
that
the
rights
of
the
witnesses
were
not
unduly
abridged
under
the
first
amendment
because
of
the
overriding
interest
and
this
interest
of
the
state
and
--
and
investigating
and
legislating
on
the
communist
party
in
view
of
the
recognized
nexus
of
the
party
would
overthrow
the
government.
thank
you.
