justice
hugo
l.
black
apparently
thought
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
count
5
was
based
on
the
letter,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
it
printed
the
letter
in
full,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
printed
the
letter
in
full
in
their
opinion,
did
they
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
all
--
did
they
all
closely
related
to
the
same
transaction,
are
they
not,
all
five
of
the
six
of
these
counts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
have
in
mind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
have
a
number
of
questions
asked
about
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
a
communist
had
an
objective
to
try
to
keep
those
bills
from
being
passed,
suppose
they
had
that
objective
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
that
a
--
a
communist
actually
wrote
a
letter
to
somebody
saying
that,
i
want
you
to
oppose
this
bill,
would
that
be
any
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doesn't
a
communist
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
right
to
ask
people
to
impose
bills
to
non-communist?
justice
hugo
l.
black
destroying
property
how,
by
doing
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
doing
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
he
indicted
for
bombing
a
house?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
one
has
to
do
it,
but
as
the
case,
where
he
was
charged
with
having
guns
of
colored
people
to
live
in
a
white
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
what
probable
cause
has
to
do
with
the
case
of
this
kind.
i
understand
that
probable
cause
has
something
to
do
when
you
swear
out
a
warrant
against
him
or
when
you
get
a
search
warrant
or
when
you're
trying
a
man
for
crime.
what
is
probable
cause?
every
time
they
have
a
probable
cause
to
believe
a
man
belongs
to
something,
do
you
mean
to
say
that
that
opens
up
the
way
for
bringing
him
in
to
find
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that's
why
i
didn't
see
the
relevance
of
you
continuing,
both
in
the
idea
of
what
the
committee
had
probable
cause
to
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
thinking
is
the
withdrawal
between
the
committee's
right
to
ask
mr.
runway
to
give
the
names
of
the
people
who
had
something
to
do
with
his
books
and
the
--
the
(inaudible)
to
get
these
people
(voice
overlap)
to
give
the
information
they
ask,
both
of
them
were
seeking
to
influence
legislations.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
compared
--
have
you
compared
the
language
of
that
revolution
with
reference
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
the
language
of
this
--
with
the
language
of
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
--
i
haven't
noticed
but
i
haven't
seen
it
again.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
within
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
find
it
in
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
unusual
about
that
practice
on
the
part
of
the
government
--
take
into
a
different
--
taking
the
same
witnesses
on
the
different
parts
of
the
country
to
testify
to
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
my
committee.
