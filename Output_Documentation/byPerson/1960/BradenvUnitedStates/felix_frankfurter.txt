justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
have
to
decide
any
of
these
questions
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
know,
who
would
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
court
of
appeals
merely
arrested
the
afferents
on
the
propriety
or
the
legality
of
that
in
one
question,
your
conflict
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
said
so
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
do.
they've
discussed
count
3
and
on
page
119
they
say,
we
need
not
make
any
analysis
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
upon
which
other
counts,
it
took
me
some
time
to
discover
what
--
what
the
exclusion
was
which
other
counts
of
the
indictment
were
based.
justice
felix
frankfurter
stating
of
the
appellant's
conviction
on
any
one
of
the
counts
would
require
an
affirmance
of
concerns
that
were
imposed
and
it
is
that
count
third,
beginning
with
the
bottom
page
115
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
put
all
the
other
(inaudible)
as
i
read
his
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
while
you
make
--
while
you
make
of
the
explicit
statement,
we
need
not
make
any
analysis
of
the
pertinency
of
the
questions
upon
which
other
counts
to
the
indictment
were
based.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
implies
that
they
were
merely
concerned
with
some
counts
or
counts
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
page
159,
it
is
such
that
one
count,
the
third
count
and
one
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
very
important
what
you
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
this
resolution
is
any
different
than
the
resolution
that
we've
been
considering?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
suppose
of
that
at
the
beginning,
what
the
government's
view
is
--
you
say,
at
least
one
count,
anyone,
if
it
to
anyone,
then
it
must
consider
all
five
or
other
five
counts,
six
counts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
say
anyone,
then
we
--
when
do
we
must
consider
all
five.
if
you
say
a
particular
one,
then
one
may
concentrate
on
and
see
if
that
satisfies
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
view
of
the
government?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
briefly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
my
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
i'd
like
to
ask
you
one
other
question
at
the
threshold,
if
you
mainly
rely
on
five
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
even
consider
five,
then
there
arises
in
my
mind,
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
shouldn't
be
--
shouldn't
be
asked
to
consider
five
rather
than
have
us
consider
it
in
the
first
instance(inaudible).
if
--
if
what
you
regard
as
the
strongest
count,
such
as
the
infiltration
as
was
just
said,
be
what
you
regard
is
the
strongest
count
and
that
has
been
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
had
reversed
--
as
in
--
as
unsupportable
that
count,
then
presumably,
they
would've
found
the
other
counts
in
support
of
it.
and
if
they
had
reversed
and
we
are
confronted
with
the
contingency,
whether
it's
the
government
that
sought
to
appeal
which
is
might
not
have
done,
we
would
ever
granted
certiorari
and
therefore,
the
reversal
would
have
been
--
from
judgment
to
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
an
affirmance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting,
this
thing
is
--
is
the
answer.
i
want
to
know
what
the
government's
position
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
because
that
terms
on
even
every
count
in
this
state
is
some
blend
as
is
explained
from
the
argument
is
some
blend
of
judgment
on
what
might
be
called
facts
of
the
inferences
or
atmosphere,
the
case
is
full
of
atmosphere.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
you
said
they
didn't
even
refer
to
count
5
except
to
say
that
there
was
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
discuss
it.
they
did
in
the
rest
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
to
me
--
and
to
me
even
if
a
court
--
as
before
it,
several
problems
and
doesn't
consider
one,
i
mean
articulately,
discloses
its
mind
on
the
title
of
page
that
didn't
consider
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
yeagley,
i
haven't
read
your
point
and
looked
at
your
brief
and
so
i
don't
know
whether
the
government
sets
forth
inferences
in
which
wherein
legislation
is
proposed
to
congress,
efforts
are
made
through
mass
telegrams
and
letters
that
influenced
the
defeat
or
to
pass
it
if
you
will,
for
that
legislation,
have
you
collected
the
instances
in
history
of
this
country
which
that
was
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
people
were
summoned
before
a
committee
to
testify
whether
they
did
send
such
messages
and
for
whom
they
did
and
whether
there
were
similarities
in
the
messages
(inaudible)
would
tender
or
focus
of
such
propaganda
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
you've
found
a
good
deal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
any
committee
member
--
did
any
committee
member
make
any
such
assertion
as
a
committee
member?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no,
the
hearings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
--
no,
on
this
point,
on
the
question
that
justice
stewart
just
asked
you.
did
any
committee
member
other
than
mr.
arens
state
on
his
oath
as
a
member
of
the
committee
to
which
this
court
gave
great
weight
to
the
oath
of
the
member
of
committee
in
the
mcgrain
case,
was
that
a
statement
made
on
the
basis
of
an
oath
on
his
responsibility
as
a
member
of
the
house?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
must
be
very
stupid
not
to
put
a
very
simple
thought
into
words.
what
members
of
the
committee
stated
that
they
asked
this
question
because
they
had
information
that
he
was
a
hardcore
member.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
alright
that's
an
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
whether
you
contend
that
merely
because
people
petition
congress
on
any
subject
that
immunizes
them
from
being
called
with
reference
to
that
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
a
man
petitions
congress
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
thereafter,
he
can
no
longer
be
--
he
cannot
be
called
and
questioned
regarding
anything
pertaining
that
exercise
of
the
right
to
petition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can't
be
asked
--
did
you
--
were
you
stimulated,
were
you
asked
by
some
interested
party
to
write
that.
he
can't
be
asked
any
of
those
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
know
the
whole
practice
of
congress
is
against
that,
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
--
the
committee
dealing
with
lobbying
and
with
utility
regulations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
heard
of
other
committees
that
had
been
doing
that
all
the
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that's
this
case
as
such,
but
i
just
want
to
know
what
is
implied
by
this
argument
that
this
was
an
exercise
of
the
petitioning
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
because
i
have
a
financial
interest
and
petitioned
congress,
that
takes
me
out
of
the
first
amendment,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
of
course,
if
congress
has
no
power
to
legislate
with
the
implication
of
that
and
it
can't
inquire
the
basis
of
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
it
has
power
to
legislate,
does
it
make
any
difference
which
power
of
congress
would
be
involved
in
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
legislate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
that's
a
very
practical
question.
if
it
has
power
to
legislate
with
reference
to
the
post
office,
if
it
has
power
to
legislate
under
the
commerce
clause,
if
it
has
power
to
legislate
for
the
security
of
the
country,
if
it
has
power
to
establish
unarmed
--
armed
services,
is
the
power
of
antecedent
inquiry
as
to
either
the
need
or
the
nature
of
the
proposed
legislation,
any
different
as
to
any
of
those
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
philosophic
question.
that's
a
very
practical
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
could
find
out
whether
the
shipment
contained
a
machine
gun
or
candy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
--
i
didn't
mean
to
intimate
remotely.
whether
i
thought
this
question
was
relevant,
having
addressing
myself
to
the
general
atmosphere
that
has
been
created
by
counsel
that
because
it
was
an
exercise
of
the
petitioning
right
of
a
citizen,
therefore,
the
witness
can't
be
summoned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
your
--
the
emphasis
has
been
on
the
fact
that
that
this
was
an
exercise
of
the
petitioning
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
you
now
imply
that
because
you
exercise
the
petitioning
right
and
because
you
asked
somebody
else
to
exercise
it,
therefore,
the
witnesses
are
immune
and
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
the
nature
of
the
exercise
of
the
petitioning
right
may
be
and
has
been
itself
a
subject
matter
of
investigation
by
congress.
