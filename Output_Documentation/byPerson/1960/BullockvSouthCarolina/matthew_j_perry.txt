mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
on
august
the
3rd,
1958
in
dillon
county,
south
carolina,
there
occurred
one
of
those
crimes
which
generally
engenders
a
great
deal
of
passion
in
the
local
community.
a
lady
was
killed
out
in
the
cemetery
of
dillon
county,
south
carolina.
she
and
a
male
companion
were
in
the
cemetery
and
the
evidence
presented
at
the
trial
was
to
the
effect
that
someone
came
up
behind
the
car
which
they
were
sitting
and
fired
a
shot
or
shots
into
the
car.
the
next
day,
the
body
of
this
lady
was
found
to
some
distant
from
the
automobile
which
was
parked
in
the
cemetery.
evidence
also
showed
that
the
companion
of
the
deceased
was
injured
by
gunshot
wound.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
was
the
evidence
presented
at
the
trial,
sir.
and
there
was
other
evidence
which
i
think
forms
a
part
of
the
confession
which
has
been
an
issue
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
on
august
the
7th,
1958,
the
petitioner,
quincy
bullock
was
arrested
at
--
at
his
home.
bullock
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
dillon
county
jail
and
was
confined
overnight
in
the
dillon
county
jail.
he
denied
commission
of
the
offense
on
the
day
of
his
arrest.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
bullock
was
46
years
old
at
that
time,
sir.
on
the
following
day,
the
sheriff
and
other
officers
of
dillon
county,
south
carolina
went
into
the
new
jail
of
dillon
county
and
transferred
bullock
over
to
the
old
jail
which
houses
no
prisoners.
the
record
does
not
reveal
any
reason
for
this
particular
action
on
the
part
of
the
law
enforcement
authorities
other
than
for
questioning.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
old
jail
of
dillon
county
houses
no
prisoners.
the
questioning
continued
for
more
than
an
hour.
and
bullock
later
contended
that
he
was
brutally
beaten
by
the
police
officers
while
he
was
in
the
old
jail.
in
fact,
his
contention
was
that
a
sheet
was
placed
over
his
head
and
that
he
was
brutally
beaten
and
kicked
on
his
chin.
after
questioning
in
the
old
jail
of
dillon
county,
bullock
was
removed
over
to
the
judges'
chambers,
which
adjourns
the
courtroom
in
the
courthouse.
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
testified
that
in
removing
bullock
from
the
old
jail
over
to
the
new
jail,
he
was
doing
so
far
bullock's
protection
and
that
a
mob
of
some
200
or
300
persons
had
gathered
around
the
old
jail.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
the
evidence
in
fact,
the
testimony
of
bullock
appears
to
be
that
he
did
not
see
the
200
or
300
people
there
although
it
is
difficult
to
understand
why
he
didn't
see
them.
the
sheriff
and
the
other
officers
saw
them
and
apparently
removed
bullock
for
his
own
protection.
that
appears
to
be
a
conflict
in
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
and
of
quincy
bullock
himself.
we
think
of
course
that
the
presence
of
--
of
such
a
large
number
of
persons
around
to
the
extent
that
the
sheriff
himself
was
concerned
for
the
welfare
of
bullock
perhaps
had
its
influence
in
the
totality
of
the
situation.
while
in
the
judge's
chambers
adjoining
the
courtroom,
bullock
saw
his
sister-in-law.
now,
the
sister-in-law,
though
a
member
of
his
family
was
not
there
for
the
purpose
of
visiting
bullock
or
giving
him
comfort,
but
was
brought
in
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
for
the
purpose
of
reputing
bullock's
assertion
that
he
did
not
have
a
gun.
and
so,
for
all
practical
purposes,
we
submit
that
--
that
her
visit
with
him
in
the
judge's
chambers
adjoining
the
courtroom
was
on
--
in
other
than
--
than
friendly
or
social
purposes.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
he
was
not.
thereafter,
after
questioning
for
an
additional
hour
or
two,
bullock
was
taken
back
into
the
county
jail
where
he
had
been
incarcerated
overnight.
and
there,
he
saw
and
conversed
with
his
wife,
mattie
bullock.mattie
bullock
was
also
under
arrest.
in
fact,
in
investigation
of
the
same
crime
and
so
we
again
note
that
the
fact
that
he
saw
mattie
bullock,
his
wife,
does
not
interfere
with
our
contention
that
bullock
was
in
fact
being
held
incommunicado.
after
mattie
bullock
saw
the
defendant,
then
her
testimony
given
at
the
trial
was
to
the
effect
that
when
she
saw
her
husband,
his
face
was
swollen
to
the
point
that
his
eye
was
almost
closed
and
that
he
could
not
have
walked.
now,
this
testimony
of
mattie
bullock
is
unchallenged
in
the
record.
it
is
recognized
that
the
issue
of
--
of
brutality
generally
is
sharply
contested
by
the
sheriff
and
the
law
enforcement
officers
of
dillon
county.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
was
taken
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
otherwise,
the
testimony
of
mattie
bullock
was
taken
in
the
presence
of
the
jury
as
a
witness
for
the
defendant.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
procedure
that
south
carolina
follows
sir
and
which
is
outlined
in
the
opinion
written
by
mr.
justice
moss
that
when
the
issue
of
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
that
brought
into
issue
that
the
judge
shall
immediately
exclude
the
jury
and
conduct
a
separate
or
private
examination
of
the
witnesses
having
any
knowledge
about
the
issue
of
coercion.
and
that
is
what
happened
here.
the
judge
--
the
presiding
judge
did
excuse
the
jury
and
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
was
placed
on
the
witness
stand
and
was
examined
both
by
solicitor
kilgo
and
cross-examined
by
mr.
ritz
(ph).
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir
and
i
submit
that
this
was
not
in
chambers
but
in
open
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
think
it
is
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it's
--
the
test
is
in
the
judge's
own
mind
as
to
whether
or
not
the
evidence
presented
on
the
issue
of
coercion
convinces
him
that
the
confession
is
voluntary,
then
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
voluntary
is
submitted
to
the
jury
and
with
appropriate
instructions
which
the
court
did
in
this
case.
he
instructed
the
jury
that
if
they
should
find
that
the
confession
was
involuntary,
that
they
should
disregard
it.
he
did
this
both
before
the
testimony
was
--
was
pursued
concerning
the
confession
and
later
in
his
charge
to
the
jury.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir,
it
was.
the
question
of
brutality
was
sharply
contested
but
we
submit
that
the
testimony
of
bullock's
wife,
mattie
bullock,
is
not
in
--
not
contested,
that
when
she
saw
him
on
friday,
august
the
8th,
he
--
his
--
his
face
was
swollen
to
the
point
that
his
eye
was
almost
closed
and
he
couldn't
have
walked.
now,
there
was
reply
evidence
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that's
--
that's
a
quote
from
the
record,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
a
dr.
branford
testified
that
on
monday,
august
the
11th,
he
examined
the
petitioner
and
that
he
saw
no
--
no
evidence
of
bruise.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that's
three
days
later,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
the
substance
of
our
contention
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
do
not,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
is,
taking
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
and
the
other
officers
that
bullock
was
not
beaten.
that
of
course
would
put
an
issue
of
the
contention
of
mattie
bullock
that
that's
when
she
saw
and
his
face
was
swollen
but
we
do
submit
that
--
that
that
particular
statement
of
mattie
bullock
is
unchallenged.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
she
did
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
only
sheriff
--
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
testified.
now,
thereafter,
bullock
was
taken
over
to
his
home
where
the
--
where
the
gun
was
retrieved.
the
evidence
was
that
bullock
had
the
gun
placed
in
a
wall
in
his
home.
and
later,
as
he
was
testifying
in
the
--
in
the
trial
of
course,
he
seem
to
place
great
deal
of
stress
on
the
fact
that
he
was
simply
attempting
to
protect
his
gun
of
being
discovered
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
because
he
was
afraid
that
would
be
taken
from
him.
be
that
as
it
may,
the
gun
was
retrieved
from
inside
a
wall
near
the
window
in
his
bedroom.
here
again,
mattie
bullock
testified
that
she
went
over
to
the
home
with
the
officers
and
with
her
husband
and
that
it
was
necessary
that
he'd
be
given
some
assistance
to
go
from
the
sheriff's
car
into
the
home
that
still
he
couldn't
have
walked,
that
he
was
obviously
bruised.
now,
the
testimony
of
mattie
bullock,
i
again
submit
of
course
is
unchallenged
except
for
the
general
denial
of
the
law
enforcement
officers
that
--
that
no
physical
brutality
was
inflicted
upon
bullock.
after
the
gun
was
retrieved,
bullock
was
then
taken
in
an
automobile
out
on
the
outskirts
of
town
to
a
motel
known
as
faith
motel.
now,
the
--
the
testimony
is
that
they
stopped
there.
it
was
--
it
was
very
brief
but
we
do
submit
that
this
is
--
all
falls
within
the
chain
of
moving
bullock
around
always
in
the
presence
of
a
number
of
law
enforcement
officers.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
this
was
on
friday,
august
the
8th,
the
afternoon
of
the
8th
after
the
gun
was
retrieved.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
record
is
silent
as
to
whether
he
was
taken
in
the
motel.
as
i
understand
the
contention
of
the
state,
he
was
not
taken
in
the
motel
but
was
left
in
the
car
on
the
outside
of
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
apparently,
that
is
the
contention
of
the
state,
sir.
they
had
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that's
still
in
dillon
county
sir.
mr.
justice
clark,
after
they
did
leave
the
faith
motel,
the
evidence
is
that
bullock
was
kept
in
the
car
in
which
he
was
riding
and
then
taken
over
into
adjoining
marion
county.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
believe
that
this
officer
that
they
picked
was
an
officer
of
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division.
i
do
not
recall
at
this
time
but
it
occurs
to
me
that
he
might
have
been
the
ballistics
expert.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
thereafter,
bullock
was
taken
over
into
adjoining
marion
county
and
was
surrounded
by
a
number
of
officers
including
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county,
several
of
his
deputies
and
some
men
from
the
south
carolina
law
enforcement
division.
and
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
was
that
bullock
made
the
first
admission
while
sitting
in
the
car
on
the
outside
of
the
marion
county
jail.
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
was
that
bullock
said
to
him,
"if
you
say
i've
done
it,
i've
done
it."
that
was
the
form
of
the
admission.
this
constituted
the
form
of
the
admission
and
thereafter,
bullock
was
placed
in
the
marion
county
jail,
well
this
being
friday
night,
august
the
8th.
and
he
was
thereafter
held
in
the
marion
county
jail
until
monday,
august
the
11th.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
is
my
understanding,
my
recollection
that
it
was,
sir.
that
the
--
that
the
sheriff
testified
in
his
direct
examination
after
the
judge
had
already
charged
that
if
the
jury
should
find
the
confession
involuntary
that
they
should
not
consider
it.
this
was
included
in
the
sheriff's
direct
examination.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
if
you
say
i
have
done
it,
i
have
done
it.
now
on
monday,
august
the
11th,
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
along
with
some
of
his
other
officers
went
to
the
dillon
county
jail
--
to
the
marion
county
jail,
i
beg
your
pardon,
and
brought
bullock
back
to
the
dillon
county
jail.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
they
are
two
small
counties
which
adjoined
each
other
over
in
the
eastern
section
of
south
carolina
near
the
atlantic
ocean.
there's
a
distance
of
less
than
30
miles
as
i
recall.
i
maybe
slightly
old
on
that
but
they
are
reasonably
closer.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
on
the
way
back
to
the
dillon
county
jail,
a
stop
was
made
in
the
cemetery
on
the
outskirts
of
dillon
in
which
this
crime
is
alleged
to
have
been
committed.
and
bullock
later
was
called
upon
to
reconstruct
the
crime
at
that
--
at
that
location.
bullock
in
his
testimony
stated
that
the
officers
told
him
where
to
point
and
he
simply
pointed
out
anywhere,
"so
they
wouldn't
get
a
hold
of
me
no
more."
that
was
the
--
the
reason
which
bullock
himself
assigned
to
his
having
pointed
in
any
direction
in
the
cemetery.
of
course
that
is
she
was
also
in
conflict,
the
sheriff
testifying
that
bullock
pointed
exactly
to
the
spot
where
the
crime
was
allegedly
committed
and
where
the
body
was
found.
but
bullock
in
his
--
in
his
testimony
stated
half
crying
in
the
court
that
he
simply
pointed
out
anywhere
so
they
"wouldn't
get
a
hold
of
me
no
more."
bullock
was
then
taken
to
the
dillon
county
jail
and
a
statement,
a
written
statement
prepared
for
his
signature.
the
evidence
was
--
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
was
that
--
that
bullock
would
make
a
statement
and
that
the
clerk
who
--
who
was
preparing
the
statement
would
--
would
translate
what
bullock
have
said
and
write
it
down
into
a
statement
on
the
paper
and
that
the
--
the
written
confession
which
was
somewhat
lengthy
was
the
product
of
this
kind
of
exchange
between
bullock
and
the
officer
who
was
preparing
a
statement,
that
bullock
would
make
a
statement
and
the
officer
would
translate
it
and
write
it
down
in
his
own
words.
after
some
ado,
the
statement
was
completed
and
bullock
signed
the
statement.
now,
a
contention
was
made
in
the
court
below
that
bullock
did
not
receive
a
copy
of
the
statement
in
accordance
with
--
with
south
carolina
law
in
this
interpreted
subject
but
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
resolved
that
against
our
contentions.
and
of
course,
we
make
no
--
no
issue
on
it
here.
but,
there
was
some
showing
made
in
the
record
on
--
on
the
part
of
counsel
who
conducted
the
trial
of
the
case
that
the
--
the
exhibit
was
removed
from
the
typewriter
and
apparently
thereafter,
reinserted
for
the
purpose
of
adding
the
words,
"i
have
received
a
copy
of
this
confession."
and
of
course,
south
carolina
statute
requires
that
--
that
such
a
statement
be
included
on
any
confession
before
it
can
be
used
in
evidence
against
the
accused.
about
an
hour
later,
another
statement
was
prepared.
this
one
of
course
purporting
to
be
a
written
reconstruction
of
the
crime
and
that
one
also
was
signed
by
bullock.
and
apparently,
reinserted
also
for
the
purpose
of
adding
the
words,
"i
have
received
a
copy
of
this
statement."
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
there
was
differences
--
there
were
differences
in
substance.
the
first
is
purporting
to
--
to
be
the
confession
in
narrative
form.
and
the
second,
a
collaborating
statement
made
for
the
purpose
of
reconstructing.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
substantial
are
the
same,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
as
i
recall
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
contention
of
the
--
the
state
was
that
the
deceased
had
been
shot
more
than
once.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
once
while
in
the
car
and
once
later
at
the
point
where
her
body
was
found
or
at
some
point
prior.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
do
not,
sir.
it's
our
contention
principally
that
the
--
the
method
of
extracting
the
confession
validated
the
--
the
right
to
due
process
of
law
of
the
petitioner
and
hence
should
not
have
been
considered.
the
petitioner
was
thereafter
confined
on
the
motion
of
the
state
to
the
south
carolina
hospital
for
a
psychiatric
examination
for
a
period
of
30
days.
and
on
the
same
day
that
he
was
committed
being
august
the
26th
as
i
recall,
two
lawyers
in
the
city
of
dillon
were
notified
by
the
presiding
circuit
judge
of
that
circuit
that
they
were
appointed
to
defend
the
accused.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
is
--
it
is
wildly
used
in
south
carolina
by
the
state
as
an
effort,
i
believe,
to
expedite
the
handling
of
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it's
my
understanding
that
it's
largely
routine.
although,
it
is
also
used
where
there
is
evidence
of
insanity.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
clearly,
the
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
would
hesitate
to
comment
on
that
sir
unless
the
court
requires
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
tells
us.
i
--
i
suspect
that
the
real
reasoning
is
that
the
crime
was
committed
on
august
3rd.
and
the
next
term
of
court
would
commence
on
about
october
16th
or
thereabout.
and
because
of
the
lapse
of
time
between
august
the
3rd
and
october,
it
was
possibly
felt
that
the
--
since
the
accused
had
a
right
to
be
committed
if
--
if
he
wanted
to
that
possibly
the
state
should
go
ahead
and
get
the
period
of
examination
out
of
the
way
so
that
when
the
october
term
of
court
came,
that
there
would
be
no
purpose
of
delaying
the
prosecution
by
reason
of
such
a
request.
i
hastened
to
say
that
that
is
merely
--
merely
speculation
on
my
part
and
i
certainly
do
not
attribute
to
the
solicitor
any
--
any
scheme
of
course
to
deprive
the
accused
of
his
rights
in
connection
with
any
plea
of
insanity
or
so
forth.
the
court-appointed
counsel
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
the
accused
until
a
few
days
before
his
trial.
and
did
not
proceed
of
his
defense
until
sometime
thereafter
by
reason
of
their
statement
that
of
course
he
did
not
apparently
trust
them
in
the
beginning.
i
believe
there
was
some
contention
that
he
apparently
wished
to
obtain
attorneys
in
another
city
and
after
ascertaining
that
those
attorneys
were
not
available
that
he
then
gave
his
statement
to
his
court-appointed
counsel.
the
counsels
who
were
appointed
conducted
the
defense
of
the
defendant
vigorously.
they
raised
to
the
pertinent
questions
which
were
necessary
to
protect
him
and
defended
him
as
i
say
rather
vigorously.
the
confessions
were
received
an
evidence
and
the
court
--
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
and
under
the
--
the
requirement
of
south
carolina
where
a
defendant
is
found
guilty
of
the
murder
case
without
recommendation
to
the
mercy
of
the
court,
the
death
--
that
death
penalty
is
mandatory.
the
court
accordingly
sentenced
the
--
the
defendant
to
death
in
the
electric
chair.
thereafter,
the
present
counsel
in
the
case
were
substituted
and
the
appeal
taken
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
in
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina,
it
was
contented
by
assignment
of
error
that
the
--
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
due
process
of
law
by
reason
of
the
--
the
receiving
evidence
of
the
confessions
and
the
inculpatory
statements
made
on
friday,
august
the
8th,
1958.
now,
these
and
other
contentions
of
the
defendant
were
resolved
against
the
--
the
defendant
and
the
court
affirmed
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
generalization
to
dillon
county.
thereupon
after
a
rehearing
was
denied,
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
--
the
--
taking
the
uncontroverted
portion
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
it
is
certainly
recognized
that
in
a
case
of
this
nature.
this
court
will
examine
the
entire
record.
and
even
though
the
--
the
contested
issues
which
lead
to
the
making
of
the
confession
are
said
to
come
here
conclusively
resolved
by
the
adjudication
of
the
court
below.
and
nevertheless,
we
recognize
that
this
court
does
make
its
own
independent
examination
of
the
records.
it
is
submitted
that
the
uncontradicted
portions
of
the
record
in
this
case
presents
a
series
of
--
of
things,
which
we
think
bear
heavily
upon
the
issue
of
coercion.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
very
good,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
alright,
sir.
we
contend
first
of
all,
that
the
petition
of
being
of
a
different
race
from
the
arresting
officers
was
one
of
the
issues
which
might
present
some
circumstance,
which
the
court
might
consider.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
certainly
would
not
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
--
i
would
not
go
that
far,
sir.
i
--
i
simply
urge
that
in
this
case,
the
--
the
racial
difference
of
the
accused
from
his
arresting
officers
taken
in
connection
with
the
other
factors,
which
i
shall
attempt
to
cover
might
have
some
way.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
certainly
did
not
intend
--
did
not
intend
to.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
think,
sir
--
as
i
say,
i
certainly
did
not
intend
to
--
to
generalize
it
to
the
extent
of
having
this
court
to
consider
it
as
one
of
the
overriding
factors.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
understand,
sir.
we
--
we
merely
point
out
that
in
--
in
a
situation
where
a
lady
who
is
apparently
very
well-known
in
the
southern
community
is
brutally
killed,
the
--
the
race
of
the
accused
may
possibly
take
on
some
added
meaning
and
particularly
as
he
is
surrounded
by
--
surrounded
by
--
by
officers
of
the
opposite
race
who
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
next,
it
is
shown
that
the
petitioner
is
illiterate.
this
court,
of
course,
has
stated,
i
believe,
on
many
occasions
that
the
educational
level
of
the
accused
is
relevant
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
confession
is
coerced.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
he
could
not
read,
sir,
and
the
record
shows
that
he
could
write
only
his
name.
and
he
did
in
fact
write
his
name
on
the
exhibits
in
this
case.
it
is
submitted
that
the
petitioner
that
was
held
incommunicado
from
the
time
of
his
arrest
on
august
7th
through
august
the
11th
at
which
time
he
confessed.
now,
we
recognize
the
--
the
short
visits
with
his
sister-in-law
who
was
brought
in
for
the
purpose
of
contesting
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
he
owned
a
gun.
and
also,
the
fact
that
he
saw
wife
briefly,
she
being
also
under
arrest.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
record
does
not
show
that
it
was
curtailed,
sir.
however,
in
the
regular
course
of
--
of
police
work
after
the
prisoner
was
returned
to
his
cell
for
a
few
minutes
and
during
which
time
he
had
a
short
visit
with
his
wife.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
record
does
not
--
does
not
bear
us
out
on
that
particular
one,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
issue
was
not
--
was
not
answered,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
beg
your
pardon.
only
after
the
court
appointed
counsel.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
--
the
counsel,
the
only
counsel
which
bullock
had
was
appointed
by
the
court
on
august
the
26th,
some
several
weeks
after
the
commission
of
this
offense.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
was
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
record,
your
honor,
does
not
show
that
the
prisoner
requested
to
see
anyone
and
that
that
request
was
reviewed.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
of
course,
would
respectfully
urge
that
here,
we
had
a
hideous
crime
which
was
committed
and
the
authorities
were
trying
very
--
very
strenuously
to
solve
that
--
that
crime.
the
first
inculpatory
statement
having
been
made
on
friday,
august
the
8th,
the
prisoner
was
transferred
to
adjoining
marion
county
and
we
--
we
submit
that
--
that
since
the
prisoner
was
said
to
have
made
his
first
inculpatory
statement.
at
that
time,
it
was
transferred
to
an
adjoining
county.
there
is
certainly
a
presumption
that
he
was
being
held
incommunicado
although
i
hasten
to
say
that
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record
any
request
that
he
made
to
confirm
with
counsel
or
for
instance
in
that
request
denied.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
kind
sir.
i
might
say
on
that
same
point,
sir
that
the
petitioner
was
not
taken
immediately
to
a
magistrate
and
a
warrant
securing
for
his
arrest.
although
during
that
period
from
august
the
7th
through
august
the
11th,
the
petitioner
was
incarcerated
in
close
proximity
of
a
magistrate.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
think
that
on
the
evening
of
friday
the
8th,
1958,
the
authorities
had
formed
an
opinion
concerning
the
complicity
of
this
petitioner,
concerning
the
commission
of
the
offense.
and
as
of
that
moment,
if
not
prior
to
that,
i
believe
they
were
under
a
duty
to
--
to
take
him
before
a
magistrate
and
secure
a
warrant.
now,
may
i
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
without
unnecessary
delay.
as
i
seem
to
recall,
sir,
it's
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
6.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
record
does
not
show
that
that
was
the
case,
sir.
however,
the
offense
having
been
committed
on
august
the
3rd,
and
this
petitioner
having
been
arrested
on
august
the
7th,
there
was
a
lapse
of
a
period
of
about
four
days.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
the
statute
of
south
carolina
section
43
and
section
222
requires
that
where
an
arrest
is
made
by
a
deputy
sheriff
without
a
warrant
that
the
person
arrested
shall
be
carried
before
a
magistrate
and
a
warrant
of
arrest
procured
and
disposed
off
as
the
magistrate
shall
direct.
so,
it
doesn't
say
--
it
doesn't
use
the
phrase
without
unnecessary
delay,
but
it
did
say
he
shall
be
carried.
and
i
submit
that
of
course
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
it
does
say
forthwith.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir,
he
does.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
apparently,
this
petitioner
was
arrested
by
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
apparently
so.
however,
i
--
it's
--
perhaps
stretching
the
--
the
rule
of
strict
interpretation
and
technicality,
a
little
too
far
to
suspect
that
the
legislature
intended
that
a
deputy
sheriff
to
pick
a
man
up
without
a
warrant
and
carry
him
and
be
required
to
carry
him
forthwith
to
a
magistrate
and
not
place
the
same
requirement
on
the
sheriff.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes
sir,
they
have.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
four
years.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir,
he
is.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
supreme
court
did
not
have
the
occasion
to
interpret.
as
matter
of
fact,
it
wasn't
--
this
particular
statute
was
not
urged
to
the
supreme
court.
it
was
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
was
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
well,
a
counsel
placed
that
interpretation
by
reason
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
not
a
judicial
interpretation.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir.
the
--
the
petitioner
was
--
was
continuously
interrogated.
that
i
believe
is
another
one
of
our
contentions
concerning
the
--
the
chain
of
circumstances
which
we
are
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
if
i'm
not
in
error,
i
believe
an
hour
and
a
half
to
hours.
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
was
present
during
the
interrogation
of
the
accused
in
the
old
county
jail
for
a
period
of
approximately
an
hour
and
a
half
to
an
hour
and
45
minutes.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
he
did
not,
however,
state
that
when
he
left
the
old
jail,
that
the
questioning
ceased
and
there
was
no
other
testimony
by
any
of
the
--
the
deputy
sheriffs
concerning
how
much
longer
the
questioning
continued.
the
next
issue
--
the
next
item
of
testimony
on
the
issue
of
--
of
interrogation
is
during
the
period
that
the
interrogation
ensued
in
the
office
of
the
presiding
judge
which
adjoins
the
courtroom.
and
the
testimony
there
is
that
the
questioning
continued
for
approximately
an
hour
and
15
minutes.
it
is
submitted,
however,
that
the
sheriff
after
the
preliminary
examination
had
been
conducted
in
the
absence
of
the
jury,
the
sheriff
was
asked
on
direct
examination
by
the
solicitor
whether
or
not
the
confessions
were
the
product
of
several
days
questioning
and
the
sheriff
stated
that
they
were.
we
also
offer
that
as
some
evidence
that
the
questioning
was
perhaps
more
lengthy
than
the
only
testimony
on
that
issue
might
show.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
he
was
arrested
on
the
7th.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
he
was
arrested
on
the
--
the
late
afternoon
of
the
7th.
in
the
early
night,
i
would
say.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
because
the
only
--
the
only
direct
testimony
on
that
issue
comes
from
the
sheriff
himself.
and
on
those
two
occasions,
he
testified
it
seems
that
a
total
period
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
sheriff
might
be
left
in
three
hours.
although
the
sheriff
does
not
--
does
not
say
that
he
was
present
at
all
times
that
the
other
officers
had
the
custody
of
the
accused.
the
next
item
that
we
contend
which
should
be
added
on
the
circumstances
to
be
considered
by
this
court
is
the
fact
that
the
--
the
petitioner
was
moved
about
first
of
all
from
the
new
jail
over
to
the
old
jail,
which
houses
no
prisoners
and
we
do
urge
that
it's
an
unoccupied
place.
it
does
not
show
that
there
are
any
particular
devices
of
law
enforcement
or
--
or
any
conference
rooms
which
the
old
jail
had
and
which
the
new
jail
did
not
have.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
seem
that
the
new
jail
would
certainly
have
better
law
enforcement
devices
than
the
old
jail.
and
that
he
was
moved
from
there
to
the
--
the
courtroom
or
the
judges
chambers
adjoining
the
courtroom
and
that
he
was
then
moved
up
to
a
motel.
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
was
taken
into
--
to
the
county
jail
then
to
his
home
then
to
the
motel
and
ultimately
to
adjoining
marion
county.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
was
no
motive
shown,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
it
was
urged
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
that
it
was
error
to
have
permitted
the
examining
physician
to
testify.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
--
that
there
is
evidence
to
that
if
we
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
horne
did
not
testify.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
of
course,
we
--
it
was
urged
to
the
court
below
that
--
that
the
absence
of
horne
left
the
status
of
this
case
in
such
a
condition
that
it
was
error
for
the
court
below
--
for
the
general
sessions
court
of
dillon
county
to
have
denied
the
request
for
continuance.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
by
the
confession
of
this
petitioner.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
however,
the
--
the
--
a
citizen
who
resides
in
close
proximity
to
the
cemetery
testified
that
horne
came
to
his
house
at
about
the
time
that
--
or
shortly
after
the
shooting
allegedly
occurred.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
are
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
two
statements
sir
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
there
are
two
statements
as
i
recall,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
both
of
which
of
course
indicate
--
one
of
which
indicates
that
that
the
firing
occurred
in
the
cemetery
and
ultimately,
the
other
one
states
that
the
--
that
another
bullet
was
fired
some
distance
from
the
cemetery
where
the
body
of
the
deceased
had
been
carried
or
where
the
lady
had
been
carried
prior
to
the
time
she
was
fatally
shot.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
was
some
distance
from
the
cemetery.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
last
occasion.
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
other
than
these
signed
confessions,
sir.
of
course,
the
other
evidence
is
circumstantial.
there
was
some
evidence
of
--
of
blood
marks
on
the
leaves
just
outside
the
automobile
and
the
bag
that
the
lady's
underwear
was
found
and
her
slip
was
found,
all
making
a
path
in
the
general
direction
of
the
point
where
the
body
was
found.
but
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
there
is
no
evidence,
no
--
no
concise
or
direct
evidence
that
the
shooting
of
the
deceased
actually
occurred
in
the
cemetery.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
evidence
was
that
horne
was
also
shot
and
a
bullet
was
received
in
the
court
below
and
the
court
of
general
sessions
allegedly
removed
from
horne.
i
might
say
that
the
ballistics
expert
who
testified
could
not
say
precisely
that
the
bullet
which
was
removed
from
--
from
the
deceased
bore
markings
similar
to
the
bullet
to
a
test
bullet
fired
from
bullock's
gun.
however,
the
same
ballistics
expert
did
testify
that
another
bullet
which
was
identified
as
having
been
removed
from
horne
did
pass
similar
markings
to
a
test
bullet
fired
from
bullock's
gun.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
seems
that
horne
had
--
had
been
in
an
accident
after
this
killing
and
before
the
trial
and
was
on
the
day
of
this
trial
confined
to
the
hospital,
i
believe
paralyzed.
however,
the
--
the
general
session's
court
was
urged
to
continue
the
case
by
reason
of
the
absence
of
horne.
it
was
felt
by
defense
counsel
that
--
that
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
examine
horne
and
perhaps
find
out
a
little
bit
more
about
this
matter.
and
so,
it
is
respectfully
suggested
that
--
that
horne
being
the
only
eye
witness,
if
--
if
it
can
be
said
that
he
was
an
eye
witness
to
any
shooting
at
all
was
a
material
witness
to
this
prosecution.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
--
the
defense
counsel,
mrs.britt
and
hawkins,
two
very
able
counsel
of
dillon
south
carolina
strenuously
urged
to
the
general
session's
court
to
continue
the
case,
to
allow
them
more
time
to
investigate
and
prepare
their
defense
and
as
part
of
their
--
their
insistence
upon
a
continuance,
they
also
urged
that
jimmy
horne
was
not
present
in
court
to
testify.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir,
it
does.
and
it
does
not
appear
that
this
was
done
although
bear
in
mind
that
the
--
the
counsel
did
not
perceive
of
bullock's
defense
until
a
very
short
time
before
he
was
tried.
and
they
were
very
busy
with
other
trials
in
the
same
term
of
court
for
which
they
have
been
compensated
and
possibly
did
not
perceive
of
the
--
the
method
of
taking
the
deposition.
moreover,
i
think
that
they
might
reasonably
have
been
expected
a
continuance
because
of
the
absence
of
this
witness.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
in
the
affidavits
of
counsel
which
is
included
in
the
--
in
the
record.
if
i
recall,
i
believe
it
appears
at
the
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
testimony
and
before
the
matter
to
proceed.
now,
the
affidavit
begins
on
page
8
and
continues
through
pages
9,
10
and
11.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
i
respectfully
submit
that
it
is
a
part
of
the
totality
picture.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
--
i
did
not
intend
to
say
that
the
denial
of
the
continuance
was
a
part
of
the
totality
picture.
i
simply
urge
that
of
course,
in
the
background
bearing
in
mind
that
the
court,
i
believe,
makes
its
independent
examination
that
deep
down
in
this
record,
there
is
some
lead
to
speculate
as
to
why
this
man
was
not
present.
and
i
merely
said
in
answer
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
whitaker
that
--
that
the
request
was
made
in
the
motion
for
a
continuance.
i
might
say
that
my
last
item
on
this
totality
picture,
if
might
call
it
the
last
item
is
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
did
not
consult
with
a
lawyer
during
the
entire
period
of
his
incarceration
beginning
august
the
7th
through
august
the
11th.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
the
record
does
not
show
that.
however,
we
do
say
that
--
that
possibly
on
our
contention
that
he
was
being
held
incommunicado
and
adjoining
marion
county
is
--
is
an
item
of
evidence
that
he
was
being
held
incommunicado
and
we
--
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
along
with
the
fact
that
he
did
not
--
that
he
did
not
consult
with
a
lawyer
and
no
one
else
advised
him
of
his
right
to
counsel
nor
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
demand
a
hearing.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
it
does
not
affirmatively
appear,
sir.
but
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
under
a
practice
duty,
i
respectfully
submit,
but
not
under
a
statutory.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
respectfully
submit
that
--
that
the
record
does
not
show
that
--
that
an
issue
was
made
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
under
south
carolina
procedure,
the
arraignment
has
had
at
least
three
days
before
the
accused
is
brought
forth
to
trial
and
this
of
course
is
during
the
term
of
the
court
of
general
sessions
that
was
in
october,
some
two
or
three
months
after
the
--
after
the
arrest.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
--
is
a
rule
which
--
which
our
courts
follow,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
actually
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
before
the
--
before
the
trial.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
possibly
a
little
more
than
three
days
since
the
court
itself
gave
i
believe
some
extra
time
after
counsel
stated
that
they
would
like
some
time
to
prepare
but
within
the
same
terms.
i
believe
this
having
been
a
two-week
term
of
court
of
general
sessions.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
he
first
saw
his
attorneys
only
a
few
days
before
his
trial.
his
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
affidavit
of
counsel
was
to
the
effect
that
they
learned
that
the
accused
had
been
found
to
be
not
insane.
on
or
about
october
the
--
the
4th
or
5th
and
on
october
the
7th,
they
requested
the
solicitor
to
have
the
petitioner
brought
back
to
dillon
county
in
order
that
they
could
confer
with
it
since
that
they
have
no
--
no
funds
for
transportation
or
anything.
in
south
carolina,
the
appointment
of
the
court
requires
counsel
to
serve
without
compensation.
and
the
solicitor
apparently
promptly
advised
the
sheriff
or
requested
the
sheriff
to
return
the
prisoner
to
dillon
county.
this
--
the
letter
of
the
solicitor
was
--
was
dated
october
the
8th.
the
term
of
court
began
as
i
recall
on
october
the
16th
and
it
appears
that
--
that
counsel
did
confer
with
him
after
he
was
brought
back,
although
it
does
not
appear
exactly
when
the
prisoner
was
returned.
i
hasten
to
say
it
does
not
appear
when
he
was
returned,
but
he
certainly
was
returned
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
court
of
general
sessions.
may
i
reserve
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
my
time
for
reply?
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
very
kindly,
sir.
may
i
offer
a
few
words
of
reply.
first
of
all,
earlier,
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
me
where
in
the
record
did
it
appear
that
the
court-appointed
counsel
urged
the
absence
of
jimmy
horne
as
a
ground
for
continuance,
and
i
stated
that
it
was
in
the
affidavit
on
page
8
and
9.
i
was
in
error.
that
was
in
the
oral
request
for
continuance
on
page
5
of
the
record.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
the
oral
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
believe
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes
sir,
as
i
understand
that
colloquy
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct
sir,
and
i
was
making
that
as
--
as
a
record.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
i
am
unable
to
say
sir
why
that's
--
why
the
absence
of
jimmy
horne
was
not
included
in
the
evidence.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
we
say
to
that
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
--
well,
horne
might
possibly
not
have
been
a
defense
witness
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
supreme
court.
that
nevertheless,
the
defendant
had
a
right
to
cross
examine
it.
and
that
possibly,
that
is
--
is
one
reason
he
should
have
been
in
court.
we
--
we
of
course
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
that
is
correct,
sir.
nevertheless,
his
absence
from
court
and
bearing
in
mind,
that
was
--
that
was
received
an
evidence,
an
item,
exhibit
10,
a
bullet
which
was
removed
from
horne
which
the
court
did
receive.
and
we
contented
in
the
court
below
that
--
to
have
received
the
bullet
into
evidence
without
horne
being
present
was
prejudicial
to
this
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
that
possibly,
it
was
error
to
receive
that
--
that
bullet
in
evidence
without
horne
being
present.
that
of
course
was
the
position
that
we
took
to
that.
may
i
say
that
the
--
that
the
solicitor
stated
that
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
has
a
prison
record.
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
concerning
the
prisoner's
past
record.
the
solicitor
says
that
precautions
used
in
investigating
this
crime
were
extraordinary.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
record
does
not
show
that
the
state
nor
anybody
connected
with
the
state
ever
advised
this
petitioner
of
his
right
to
counsel
nor
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
demand
a
hearing.
this
court
commented
upon
the
failure
of
the
state
to
do
that
very
thing
in
harris
versus
south
carolina.
the
solicitor
says
that
interrogation
is
necessary
to
law
enforcement.
well,
that
maybe
true,
we
urge
the
court
that
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
watts
versus
indiana,
"ours
is
the
accusatorial
system
and
not
the
inquisitorial
system."
the
state,
when
it
arrested
bullock,
did
not
prefer
to
charge
a
crime
against
him
but
used
his
incarceration
to
ring
from
him
the
confession
of
this
case.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
no,
sir,
i
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
yes,
sir,
we
do
and
we
urge
the
totality
of
all
of
the
circumstances
which
we
have
urged
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
--
mr.
matthew
j.
perry
thank
you
very
much.
