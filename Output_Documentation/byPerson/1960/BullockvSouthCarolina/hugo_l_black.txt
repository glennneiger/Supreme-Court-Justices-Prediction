justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
question
of
brutality
contested?
justice
hugo
l.
black
use
the
word
forthwith?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
time
of
the
day
on
the
7th?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
statement
where
they
requested
his
opinion
or
the
reason
he's
absent?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
on
page
--
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
on
page
7,
a
statement
by
you
made
in
connection
with
a
motion
for
continuance
saying
that
you
have
made
all
papers
of
evidence
that
you
had
available
to
the
defendant's
counsel
and
i
gather
that
that
includes
a
statement
made
by
this
man
horne
to
the
coroner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what's
--
it
was
later
on,
was
it
not,
that
--
that
they
made
another
motion
for
continuance
and
that
they
at
that
time
still
insist
that
horne's
absence
was
a
reason
for
continuance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
find
that
in
the
second
motion
that
they
made,
maybe
it
isn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
statement
made
there
to
show
that
how
badly
he
was
injured
or
what
was
the
matter
in
the
record?
i
can't
find
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
read
the
view
on
page
7
where
you
said,
"we
have
his
full
testimony
given
to
the
coroner's
inquest,
which
is
of
course
available
to
the
defendant's
counsel."
and
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
examination
of
his
testimony
will
show
that
he
should
not
in
any
sense
be
a
defense
witness.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
that,
did
they
--
after
that
--
insist
on
using
him
as
a
witness
waiting
for
it.i
didn't
find
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
asked
anything
about
it
when
the
confession
was
given,
why
he
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
a
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
part
of
that
on
the
way
in
the
car
when
he
went
with
the
sheriff
to
another
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
22
miles?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
does
the
record
show
why
he
was
taken
from
one
jail
to
the
other
by
this
period.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
no
explanation
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
he
was
carried
to
the
other
jail
in
the
car,
who
was
with
him?who
drove
the
car
and
who
else
was
with
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
was
he
kept
down
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
during
that
time
from
friday
to
sunday,
did
any
of
the
officers
from
the
place
where
the
--
he
was
tried,
dillon,
go
down
to
talk
to
him
in
that
jail
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
mean
outside
the
other
jail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
in
dillon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
at
the
--
at
dillon?
that
was
dillon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
population
of
dillon?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
population
of
marion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
--
just
one
other
question,
was
that
--
was
the
confession
given
immediately
after
getting
to
marion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
on
what
date?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
monday,
october
28,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
is
that
the
time
when
mr.
kilgo
told
them
that
they
had
the
coroner's
transcript
fully
written
out
and
that
it
was
available
to
the
defendant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
the
second
motion
was
filed.
i
see
that
it
was
stated
--
is
that
it
--
it's
being
renewed
based
upon
the
affidavit
which
i
now
present
to
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
affidavit,
as
i
read
it,
did
not
refer
to
mr.
horne.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
--
why
was
that
left
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
did
follow
the
statement
by
the
solicitor
that
the
coroner's
evidence
that
that
he
gave
for
the
coroner
is
available
to
you
and
that
he
had
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
already
made
it
available
to
the
defendants.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
was
after
that
that
they
made
a
motion
and
did
not
include
the
absence
of
horne
as
a
reason
for
continuance.
