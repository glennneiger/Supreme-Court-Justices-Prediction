was

justice
william

as
a

--
as

whether
he'll

exercise
until
not
testify.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
perry,
we
suggest
that
mattie
bullock's
testimony
stands
unchallenged
but
what
i've
gathered
from
the
sheriff
and
the
other
law
enforcement
officers
testified
that
there
had
been
no
beating.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
extent
i
gathered
that
the
challenge
is
this,
it
was
mattie
bullock's
description
of
him
as
having
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
not
testify
i
gather
at
the
hearing
out
of
the
presently
pledge
of
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
one
testified
at
all
for
the
defense,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
day
was
this,
mr.
perry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
like
state
police
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
perry,
is
this
an
examination
or
a
routine
sort
of
business
under
your
practice
or
has
to
be
some
reason
which
accounts
for
the
state's
motion
that
having
committed
for
a
psychiatric?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
is
that
that
you
have
to
answer
this
largely
routine
then,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
an
indication
that
the
accused
maybe
under
some
mental
difficulty
before
it's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
--
what's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
base
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
in
the
record
which
tell
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
be
the
word
forthwith.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
apparently
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
--
that
was
strange.
this
applies
only
to
the
deputy
sheriff
and
this
arresting
officer
was
the
sheriff
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
is
why
it
doesn't
apply
to
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
statute
does
not
apply,
i
gathered
from
the
text
of
his
brief.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
statute
has
no
obligation
upon
the
sheriff
as
he
is
the
arresting
officers,
but
only
a
deputy
sheriff.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
part
of
the
totality
picture?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
amount
available
of
evidence
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
as
i
understood
the
courts
to
--
that's
not
before
the
magistrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
page
114,
the
sheriff
testified
that
if
you
ask
him
about
that,
he
said,
"and
the
answer
may
begin
with
on
august
8.
if
you
say
so,
i
did."
that's
when
the
sheriff
says,
"when
quincy
first
started
his
confession,
he
answered
to
me
in
that
manner
for
about
two
different
times.
and
i
told
quincy,
i
said
i
do
not
want
that
as
an
answer,
i
want
the
truth.
and
he
later
told
me
the
truth
as
far
as
i
know."
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?
