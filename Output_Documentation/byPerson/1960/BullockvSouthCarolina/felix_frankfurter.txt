justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
of
that
testimony
is
taken
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
at
least
--
putting
up
to
state
what
the
south
carolina
rule
is
that
to
the
--
the
confidence
of
--
when
a
confession
is
offered,
what
procedure
is
followed
to
establish
the
admissibility
of
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
weren't
all
witness
is
relevant
to
the
admissibility
hearing
chamber?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
care
if
i
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
outside
the
jury
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
all
the
testimony
bearing
on
admissibility
taking
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
the
rule
must
be
that
after
the
judge
rules
his
permissibility
issue
is
retried
before
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
be
able
to
follow
your
argument,
i
think
it's
more
understanding
if
you
tell
me
whether
your
claim
is
that
the
judge
erroneously
charged
the
jury
as
to
the
standards
determining
admissibility
i.e.
voluntariness
in
defense
this
court
has,
you
could
find
it
in
decisions
or
whether
the
complaint
is
that
even
according
to
a
right
charged
on
the
evidence
in
this
case,
legally
no
such
conclusion
could
have
constitutionally
been
drawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
we
not
complaint
that
the
judge
laid
down
a
wrong
standard
or
what
himself
guided
by
wrong
standard?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
by
that
that
in
every
case
in
which
the
accused
or
the
convicted
person
is
a
colored
person
that
this
court
must
take
that
as
having
some
presumptive
weight
of
coercive
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
shouldn't
think
you
would.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
need
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
be
troubled
by
suggestion
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
the
circumstance
of
this
or
in
the
context
of
any
particular
case.
but
it
did
sound
as
though
you
made
a
generalization
as
presumptively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know,
you
might
--
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
he
had
to
do
that,
in
this
case,
we'd
have
to
take
it
in
the
case
of
a
--
of
a
mexicans,
filipinos,
jews
in
an
irish
community,
irish
people
in
the
jewish
district.
i
mean,
where
would
we
get
into
continuing
which
we
are
trying
consistently
with
facts,
with
the
realities
of
life,
not
to
emphasize
all
differences
but
it's
rather
more
and
more
contractions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
even
overriding,
but
presumptively.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
maybe
presumptive
in
a
particular
situation.
a
record
may
show
a
consistent
conduct.
i
hope
they're
not
many.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
one
who
shut
the
guy
to
this
fact,
but
i
don't
like
to
just
hold
to
see
more
than
there
is
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
--
you've
already
added
some
ingredients.
justice
felix
frankfurter
making
out
of
generality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
visit
from
the
wife
or
by
the
wife
curtailed
by
the
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
was
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
wife
understand
she
wasn't
allowed
to
and
that
he
wants
his
wife
to
stay
and
the
question
denied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
talk
with
a
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
--
he
did
have
a
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
afterwards,
access
denied
his
counsel
to
see
him?
or
the
request
by
him
to
see
his
counsel
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
during
this,
was
there
a
counsel
during
any
of
the
period,
during
which
you
claim
he
was
held
incommunicado?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
during
that
period,
he
was
--
there
was
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
during
that
period,
did
he
ask
for
any
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
any
--
let
me
generalize,
mr.
perry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
cany
request
by
him
to
see
anybody,
family,
friend,
wife
or
lawyer
during
what
you
call
a
period
of
incommunicado
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
show
that
he
was
held
more
incommunicado
than
other
persons
held
for
murder?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since,
we
have
to
seek
out
in
each
case,
yes
it
is
(voice
overlap),
but
we
have
to
ascertain
that
this
either
fact
in
the
context
of
a
circumstance
of
each
cases,
it's
important
to
ask
these
questions,
which
if
i
may
say
so
you've
given
very
candid
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
did
the
--
when
according
to
record,
varying
from
--
from
the
record,
when
did
the
police
for
the
whole
--
using
the
word
prosecution
its
comprehensive
sense,
when
was
there
--
the
assumption
or
the
belief
or
the
decision
by
the
authority
that
bullock
should,
the
guilty
person,
the
person
to
be
charged?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
phrase,
crumb
or
immediate,
or
what
is
the
word?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
there
other
people
involved
in
the
minds
of
the
authorities
as
having
complicity
in
the
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
the
record
show
even
--
no
one
i
think
of
--
well,
i
feel
very
strongly
for
the
enforcement
of
procedural
safeguard
in
criminal
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
think
you
explained
it.
but
i
think
we
must
also
take
into
account
the
responsibility
of
the
police
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
trying
to
solve
a
mystery,
a
commission
of
a
crime
particularly
where
it
creates
the
very
difficulty
of
feeling
and
where
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
know
what
the
newspapers
said
in
this
case,
but
they
usually
are
not
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
sheriffs
have
a
metric?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
what's
their
tenure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
deputy
sheriff
appointed
by
the
sheriff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
he
is
a
--
he
is
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
deal
for
a
continuance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
affirmatively
appear
that
he
was
not
told
that
he
should
have
a
lawyer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
your
--
under
south
carolina
law,
when
a
man
is
arraigned
that
the
magistrate
of
whoever
the
judicial
official
is.
is
he
under
either
the
practice
duty
or
statutory
duty
to
advice
who
advised
in
of
his
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
because
you
said
he
had
two
able
counsel
assigned
to
him,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
be
comfortable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
--
in
the
trial
court
or
at
any
stage
that
he
was
taken,
was
it
suggested
that
he
was
not
advised
of
his
right
of
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
arraigned,
in
three
days
before
a
trial
(inaudible),
presumably
the
trial,
your
trials
aren't
so
rapidly
on
the
heel
of
arrest
with
a
good
deal
of
sometimes
weeks
most
of
that
before
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what's
the
bearing
of
these
three
days
before
the
trial,
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
been
arraigned
already
before
the
magistrate,
hasn't
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
what
you
call
arraign
pleading
to
the
indictment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kilgo,
you
may
have
addressed
yourself
and
so
i
missed
it
to
the
character
or
even
--
what
might
be
called
inherent
qualifications
or
limitations
at
this
particular
quincy
bullock,
the
--
the
handicap
as
it
were,
the
disadvantage
under
where
--
he
was
--
under
which
he
being
what
he,
having
the
qualities
of
mind
but
he
had
a
--
didn't
have
kind
of
disadvantage
with
this
situation
as
such,
forced
itself
upon
them
in
any
kind
of
a
give
and
take,
an
interchange
the
law,
would
you
care
to
say
something
about
that,
if
i
made
my
question
clear
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
fact
--
the
fact
that
he
was
a
negro,
the
fact
that
he
was
a
alleged,
fact
that
he
had
some
psychological
difficulties.
now,
what's
bearing
through
those
things
have
in
the
scale
of
judgment
having
to
regard
of
what
you
said
last,
namely
the
responsibility
and
the
power
that
law
enforcement
was
already
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
--
what
is
your
practice?
i
understood
mr.
perry
to
indicate
that
you
had
a
practice,
not
a
statutory
duty
under
south
carolina
procedural
practice
and
--
and
in
the
--
and
what
the
magistrate
tells
to
an
arraigning
person?
of
course,
you
though
before
him
to
be
charged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
isn't
true
in
the
capital
cases,
is
it
mr.
kilgo?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
machinery
by
which
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
murder
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
in
the
course
of
those
eight
years,
how
many
homicide
cases
in
which
people
--
in
which
you
had
a
good
deal
of
assurance
that
you
have
--
that
the
police
had
the
right
man.
did
you
allow
people
out
on
bail?
is
--
is
that
a
matter
of
court
to
allow
people
charged
with
murder
out
on
bail
in
south
carolina?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
assumed
at
the
contrary
it
was
the
practice,
he
learned,
i
maybe
wrong.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
bail
--
what's
--
what
are
the
amounts
of
bail,
roughly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
in
these
capital
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
you
just
now
that
--
that
your
constitution
excepts
capital
cases
from
the
bail
requirement.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
now,
that
--
that
doesn't
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
catch
him
while
he
was
committing
a
murder.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
are
very
polite
people
in
south
carolina
but
does
--
do
the
murders
inform
the
police
before
they
commit
the
murder
in
south
carolina?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
place
we're
going
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
certain
intentions,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr
kilgo,
may
i
try
to
summarize
what
i
understand
to
be
the
state
position.
i
do
so
noted
that
mr.
perry
deal
with
it,
if
you
will.
as
i
understand
you,
you
say
that
the
sum
total
of
examination
of
question
non-continuously
fed
over
a
period
of
what,
24,
26
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
six
hours.
it
was
two
and
a
half
or
two
and
a
half
hours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
anyhow,
do
you
say
not
more
than
two
and
a
half
hours?
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
that
period,
he
was
denying
no
amenity
or
no
human
necessity
need.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
the
question
of
violence
is
concerned,
you
say
that
at
--
the
highest,
on
the
petitioner's
point
of
view,
there
was
--
the
evidence
is
not
uncontradicted
but
contested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
you
say
generally,
he's
been
adding
thereto
and
nothing
else
that
you
would
be
able
to
record
it
for
a
fundamentally
fair
treatment
of
a
man
charged
with
murder
with
the
limitations
of
this
man
had
being
illiterate
and
at
this
---
that
a
human
disadvantage
is
kept
off
in
no
other
way
or
was
there
any
in-road
made
upon
human
dignity
or
human
feats
or
fatherly
spiritual
comfort.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
that
was
all
part
of
the
two
and
half
hours
not
continuously
pursued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
other
jail
was
an
empty
building,
was
it?
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
an
empty
building?
and
--
and
what
kind
of
surrounding
would
you
take
judicial
notice
if
you'll
tell
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
what
--
help
me
with
this.
at
what
point
did
the
sheriff
say
or
where
were
they
and
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
intercommunication
when
he
said,
"i
don't
believe
you
or
you're
not
telling
the
truth."
is
this
on
the
ride
during
the
ride?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
jail,
in
the
old
jail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
was
before
he
gave
a
confession
or
not?
to
what
did
he
say,
"i
don't
believe
you?"
was
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
not
suggesting
or
either
that
no
statement
made
by
the
prisoner
while
in
custody
of
the
police
is
constitutionally
admissible.
you
do
not
take
that
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
it
gets
down
to
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
situation
in
this
case.
were
as
the
statement
that
was
made
and
may
fairly
be
called
--
be
fairly
be
rejected
as
not
being
voluntary
in
a
--
in
an
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
that
ordinary
people
understand
it
voluntary,
something
that's
spontaneously
invoked
instead
of
--
instead
of
being
compulsorily
evoked.
