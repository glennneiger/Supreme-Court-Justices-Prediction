--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
your
--
your
argument,
this

why
i
asked
you,
whether
that
testimony
is
submitted
before
the
jury.
justice

the
shooting,
the
murder
occurred
in

cemetery.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
did
horne
testify?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
is
the
man
who
is
with
the
lady?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
why
didn't
he
testify?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
whose
testimony
was
it
shown
that
the
girl
was
shot
in
the
cemetery?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
only
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
this
confession
involving
the
shooting
says
he
shot
--
he
shot
her
in
the
--
in
the
swamp,
which
is
not
in
the
cemetery,
but
some
distance
from
the
cemetery.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
confession
says.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
on
his
first
confession,
this
long
one,
he
says,
"on
the
cemetery,
i
saw
a
car
parked.
i
walked
on
a
piece
further
and
i
pulled
out
my
mess
and
started
shooting."
later
on,
he
says,
"after
we've
gone
into
the
swamp,
i
was
standing
about
two
feet
from
her
when
i
took
the
gun
out
of
my
pocket
and
fired
one
time
into
her
head."
that
wasn't
in
the
cemetery,
was
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
last?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then,
what
evidence
is
there
aside
--
do
you
--
do
i
understand
you
said
there
is
no
testimony
aside
from
the
confessions
that
the
girl
was
shot
in
the
cemetery?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
was
horne
also
shot?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
any
effort
made
to
defer
the
trail
pending
horne's
ability
to
get
out
to
testify?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
your
law
allow
the
taking
of
depositions
in
a
criminal
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
have
to
confess
that
statement
was
admitted
by
the
sheriff
or
was
it
an
uncontradicted
fact?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
say,
as
i
remember,
the
statement
that
a
mob
was
outside
waiting
to
get
him
was
admitted
to
have
been
made
by
the
sheriff.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
thus,
concede
that
he
made
the
statement
in
that
case,
didn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that
was
an
uncontradicted
fact.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
able
to
tell
us
whether
or
not
his
testimony
before
the
coroner
had
been
transcribed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
there
some
independent
evidence
that
placed
him
near
the
scene
of
this
accident
--
this
murder
on
the
day
it
happened?
the
taxi
cab
driver,
did
he
testify?

charles
e.
whittaker
the
taxi
driver.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

e.
whittaker
is

the
same
general
direction
as

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
where

you.
justice
