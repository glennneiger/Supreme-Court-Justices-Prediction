number
of
hours,
in

justice

i
notice

harlan
what
do
say
about
that
court
of
appeals
--
or
the
your
supreme
court's
statement
on
260
--
the
record
264
because
they
said
that
horne
could
not
have
been
a
defense
witness
because
his
full
testimony
was
given
and
returned,
his
inquest
breach
from
the
examination
thereof
shows
that
he
could
not
in
any
sense
be
a
witness
for
the
appellant.
the
appellant
does
not
contend
that
he
wished
to
call
jimmy
horne
as
a
witness
in
his
behalf
in
order
that
he
had
mainly
attempt
to
the
same
witness.
justice

justice
john
m.

examined
him
if
the
state
hasn't
called
him.
