mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
state
that
as
a
prosecuting
officer
in
this
case,
solicitor
of
the
fourth
judicial
executive
of
south
carolina,
i
am
accompanied
here
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
south
carolina
and
sheriff
rogers
of
dillon
county,
the
sheriff
who
made
the
arrest
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
state
to
the
court
the
outset
that
if
you
afore
brutality
in
law
enforcement,
you
do
not
afore
anymore
than
i
do
nor
anymore
than
the
attorney
general
of
south
carolina
and
the
people
of
south
carolina
and
sheriff
rogers,
the
sheriff
in
this
case.
we
do
not
desire
convictions
in
our
state
by
means
of
brutality
and
if
the
court
determines
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
there
is
one
single
act
of
brutality
uncontradicted,
we,
of
course
want
this
case
reversed
and
sent
back.
now,
the
position
of
the
petitioner
in
this
court
is
simply
this,
that
he
was
sentenced
subjected
to
trial
and
had
admitted
an
evidence
against
him
by
the
state
of
south
carolina
certain
confessions
that
were
extracted
for
him
--
from
him
by
means
of
force
coercion,
brutality.
now,
of
course,
the
question
is
what
has
this
court
determined
amounts
to
coercion
either
physical
or
mental
and
we,
in
our
state
attempt
to
enforce
the
law,
do
what
is
necessary
to
investigate
crime
properly,
also
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
so
that
we
may
--
we
hold
the
best
of
our
ability
remain
within
the
limits
of
this
coercion
that
this
court
has
set
out
and
we
have
examined
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
of
this
court
commencing
with
chambers
against
florida
in
1940.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
petitioner
had
been
convicted
in
the
state
of
florida
and
confession
was
involved
and
that
conviction
would
reversed
on
a
showing
undisputed,
uncontradicted
that
the
petitioners
were
subjected
to
five
days
of
continuous
questioning
culminating
in
an
all
night
session
of
questioning.
the
sheriff
in
that
case
testified
that
he
participated
in
the
questioning
during
the
day,
but
was
so
exhausted
at
night
that
he
had
to
stand
beside
and
let
others
conduct
the
night
questioning
of
the
petitioner,
which
resulted
in
a
confession.
that
was
reversed
and
we
think
properly
reversed,
chambers
against
florida.
now,
1942,
ward
against
texas,
you
had
a
murder
case,
you
had
conviction
in
the
state
court,
you
had
a
confession
as
he
urged
to
have
started
was
result
of
coercion
and
he
showed
uncontradicted
that
the
--
one
of
the
officers
slapped
him
while
he
was
under
arrest,
that
the
petitioner
was
removed
from
one
jail
to
another,
to
another
and
still
another
while
his
employer
and
attorney
was
going
about
following
the
officers
from
county-to-county
trying
to
catch
the
officers
so
that
he
could
serve
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
--
to
release
his
house
servant.
here,
you're
moving
about
one
place
to
another
to
deny
the
prisoner
the
right
to
help
from
his
attorney/employer.
during
all
of
that
time,
he
was
continually
questioned
and
he
later
confessed.
and
as
the
turning
point
in
his
confession,
he
was
told
that
there
was
threat
of
mob
violence
and
that
if
he
confess,
officers
would
protect
him.
now,
if
you
are
convinced
that
--
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
shown
that
kind
of
coercion
then
we
think
the
case
should
be
reversed.
the
next,
comes
a
case
from
mcnabb
versus
united
states
where
similar
unremitting
questioning
for
two
days
in
a
barren
cell
after
the
defense
was
left
in
a
barren
cell
for
14
hours
very
strong
feeling
of
extended
questioning
almost
amounting
to
brutality.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
time
of
the
recess,
we
were
discussing
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
on
related
questions.
we
were
discussing
the
case
of
mcnabb
versus
--
versus
the
united
states,
merely
states,
as
the
court
so
well
knows
that
that
case
involved
--
involved
rule
5
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
procedure
and
this
court
has
held
that
of
course
your
interpretation
of
the
circumstances
where
the
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
that's
involved
is
entirely
different
from
a
case
such
as
the
other
--
as
this
tried
in
the
state
courts.
and
you
did
hold
in
that
case,
however,
that
the
mere
fact
of
the
confession
was
made
while
in
the
custody
of
police,
does
not
render
inadmissible.
now,
in
1948
in
haley
versus
ohio,
the
conviction
of
robbery
and
murder
and
the
state
court
was
reversed
in
five,
four
decision
where
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
was
attacked.
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
was
arrested
at
his
home
at
midnight.
he
was
a
15-year-old
boy.
he
was
questioned
from
midnight
to
dawn.
no
one
was
allowed
to
see
him.
he
was
held
incommunicado
from
saturday
until
--
until
tuesday.
his
lawyer,
attorney
was
denied
the
right
to
see
him
on
request.
his
mother
requested
to
see
him
and
was
denied.
you
reversed
that
court
and
held
that
his
confession
was,
as
a
matter
of
law,
not
voluntary.
in
watts
against
indiana
decided
in
1949,
the
case
was
reversed
six-three.
a
confession
was
involved
in
the
case.
the
same
grounds
were
raised
as
it
raised
in
presents
--
present
case.
the
defendant
there
or

was
questioned
day
after

for
several
days
as

o'clock

a.m.
on

and

when
his
confession
was
obtained.
you
had
long
and
extended
periods
of
question
and
into
the
late
hours
3
a.m.
--
late
hours
of
the
night
in
that
case
on
six-three
decision
was
re
--
reversed.
now,
this
court
held
in
that
case,
however,
that
in
considering
these
confessions
where
a
jury
has
decided
the
case
and
heard
all
the
facts
and
reached
this
decision
at
this
court
and
considering
whether
or
not
that
confession
is
voluntary,
will
deal
only
with
uncontradicted
facts.
now,
turner
against
pennsylvania
was
decided
in
1949.
that
was
a
murder
case.
a
confession
was
obtained
from
the
petitioner.
he
was
questioned
three
or
four
hours
on
the
first
afternoon,
then
8
until
11
that
evening,
questioned
the
next
day,
five
hours,
the
next
day,
four
days
--
four
hours,
the
next
day,
six
hours
and
his
questioning
on
the
last
day
ended
at
11
p.m.
and
resulted
in
a
confession.
he
was
not
permitted
to
see
friends,
all
relatives
during
the
entire
period
of
custody.
in
addition,
the
trial
judge
on
that
case
refused
to
charge
upon
request
--
refused
to
charge
the
jury
that
they
could
consider
the
long
period
of
interrogation
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
voluntary.
now,
harris
against
south
carolina,
another
reversal,
decided
in
1949
without
pouring
the
court
the
details,
i
know
the
court
is
familiar
with
it.
you
had
there
again
long
continuous
questioning
many
days
on
a
row
and
a
threat
on
the
part
of
the
officers
to
the
accused
that
his
mother
would
be
arrested
if
he
did
not
confess.
and
as
a
result
of
that
threat,
he
confessed.
the
gallegos
against
nebraska
was
a
case
that
was
affirmed
six-three,
1951.
the
defendant
in
that
case,
the
petitioner
was
held
25
days
under
arrest
before
he
was
arraigned
or
advised
of
his
rights.
that
case
was
affirmed.
stone
against
new
york,
decided
in
1953
was
affirmed
six-three.
you
had
long
periods
of
invest
--
of
questioning
overnight
of
the
defendants
in
that
case
and
the
case
was
affirmed
six
--
five-four.
fikes
against
alabama
was
reversed,
similar
situation.
and
in
that
case,
in
addition
to
one
week
of
isolation,
the
petitioner
was
kept
in
isolation
for
a
week
except
for
short
periods
of
questioning.
petitioner's
father
and
attorney
were
barred
in
attempts
to

question
--
questioning
lasted
several
hours
at
the
time
over
a
period
of
five
days.
court
held
that
--
in
addition
that
this
petitioner
was
uncontradictedly
a
schizophrenic,
left
school
at
16
and
psychiatrist
testified
that
he
was
schizophrenic.
in
the
mallory
case,
the
mcnabb
rule
applies.
that
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
payne
against
arkansas
decided
in
1958
was
reversed
seven-two.
the
elements
presented
by
that
petitioner
indicating
coercion
where
the
--
the
members
of
his
family
were
barred
from
seeing
him
during
his
entire
period
of
incarceration.
he
was
not
permitted
to
make
a
telephone
call
when
he
requested
the
same.
he
was
denied
lunch,
denied
the
evening
meal
and
in
fact
denied
food
of
every
kind
for
40
hours
with
the
exception
of
two
sandwiches.
and
--
and
finally,
to
extract
the
confession
from
the
petitioner,
he
was
told
that
a
mob
was
outside
ready
to
come
and
get
him
and
that
a
confession
was
to
prevent
the
mob
taking
him.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir,
uncontradicted
fact
and
the
petitioner
had
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
the
mob
was
outside.
now,
in
the
present
case,
this
is
of
course,
the
court
knows
as
what
we
call
the
"lovers
lane
slain."
on
august
3rd
of
1958,
sometime
between
midnight,
1
o'clock
a.m.,
a
saturday
night
and
sunday
morning,
the
victim
in
this
case
was
in
an
automobile
parked
in
a
cemetery.
he
had
a
male
companion.
"someone,"
we
say,
the
petitioner,
"came
up
behind
the
automobile
and
commence
firing
into
the
automobile.
the
victim
who
was
later
killed
and
the
man
who
was
with
them
both
left
the
automobile,
this
is
uncontradicted
and
indirect.
they
both
ran
from
the
automobile.
he
was
hit
in
the
shoulder."
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
this
evidence
was
the
result
of
testimony
of
several
witnesses.
first,
the
--
the
confession
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
--
of
the
petitioner
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
--
outward
said
that
he
pulled
his
gun
out
and
commence
firing.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
doctor
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
man
to
whom
the
companion,
horne
went
to
for
help.
he
testified
that
horne
came
to
him
with
a
bullet
wound
in
his
right
shoulder
and
came
right
back
to
the
scene
with
him.
the
petitioner
says
that
when
--
in
his
confession
that
when
they
left,
he
followed
the
victim
to
the
road
and
then
took
her
through
the
woods
where
he
later
killed
her.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
direct
evidence
aside
from
the
confession,
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
as
you
will
--
as
you
will
note,
sir
on
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
they
did,
yes,
sir.
and
the
continuance
was
denied
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
it
--
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
in
their
affidavit
but
they
--
they
made
the
--
they
took
the
position
in
their
motion,
in
court
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
--
the
case
should
be
continued
so
that
they
would
have
an
opportunity
to
put
the
witness
horne
on
the
stand.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
do
not
know
if
there
is
any
statement
in
the
record
as
to
how
badly
horne
was
at
that
time
hurt.
we
stated
that
he
was
unavailable
in
the
hospital
and
we
did
not
know
whether
he
would
ever
be
available
or
not.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
he
--
he
testified
at
the
coroner's
inquest.
the
coroner's
inquest
was
available
to
defense
counsel,
a
matter
of
record
in
dillon
county.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
they
never
abandoned
their
motion
for
continuance.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
and
that
statement
was
made
during
the
colloquy
concerning
whether
or
not
the
continuance
should
be
granted.
they
never
abandoned
the
motion
for
continuous
but
it
was
not
granted.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
we
have
stated
to
the
court
when
this
crime
occurred.
now,
late
saturday
night,
early
sunday
morning
the
following
thursday
at
5:30
in
the
afternoon
august
7th,
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
having
considered
who
might
have
been
the
perpetuator
to
this
crime
and
for
other
reasons
that
are
not
in
the
record,
we
can't
go
into.
we
don't
want
to
go
into
them.
he
went
to
the
defendant's
home,
the
petitioner's
home
and
arrested
him
at
5:30
in
the
afternoon.
he
questioned
him
briefly
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
a
pistol.
of
course,
the
record
shows
that
we
then
had
ballistics
information
on
the
--
on
the
bullet
removed
from
the
shoulder
of
horne,
and
some
ballistics
on
the
bullet
removed
from
the
victim,
ms.
barfield.
the
petitioner
was
in
question
briefly
at
his
home
as
to
pistol
and
as
to
his
whereabouts
on
the
night
in
question.
he
gave
the
story,
gave
the
sheriff
an
alibi
stating
that
he
had
been
in
whiteville,
north
carolina
and
related
that
he
went
there
on
a
bus
and
he
came
back
--
spent
the
night
and
came
back
by
hiring
someone
else
to
bring
him
the
following
morning.
the
sheriff
arrested
them
--
arrested
the
petitioner
then,
lodged
him
in
jail
for
the
night
and
of
course
began
to
investigate
his
alibi
concerning
the
trip
to
whiteville.
now,
it's
is
significant
that
he
questioned
him
only
briefly
at
his
home
then
took
him
to
jail,
5:30
p.m.
thursday
as
when
this
commenced.
he
did
not
question
the
petitioner
thursday
night
at
all.
when
was
the
next
questioning?
8:30
or
9
o'clock
the
next
morning,
sheriff
testified
in
the
record
that
he
went
by
the
county
jail
and
talked
to
the
petitioner
four
or
five
minutes,
talked
with
him
at
the
jail.
he
then
left,
so
the
petitioner
no
more
until
that
afternoon
at
2:30
or
3
o'clock.
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
and
one
deputy
picked
up
the
petitioner
at
the
jail
and
talked
with
him
30
or
40
minutes.
then
he
left.
later,
the
sheriff
and
four
officers
talked
with
the
petitioners
at
the
judge's
chamber
and
he
testified
to
get
away
from
the
crowd.
and
then
he
testified
at
that
--
at
the
jail,
there
was
a
crowd
of
some
200
or
300
people
around.the
petitioner
denies
in
the
record
that
he
knew
they
were
there.
the
sheriff
knew
he
was
there,
moved
him
from
the
jail
up
to
the
county
courthouse
in
the
center
of
town,
went
into
the
judge's
chambers.
the
court
was
not
in
session.
and
the
question
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
old
jail
that
--
the
two
jails,
they're
side-by-side.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
recently
built
new
jail
and
he
was
questioned
in
the
old
jail
and
moved
up
to
the
courthouse.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
there's
no
--
no
explanation
in
the
record,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
they
--
it's
only
a
matter
of
conjecture.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
was
not
touched,
he
was
threatened.
he
was
merely
asked
some
questions.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
immediately
decided
to
new,
yes,
sir.
now,
the
sheriff
and
four
officers
questioned
the
defendant
in
the
judge's
chamber
of
the
courtroom
an
hour
and
15
or
20
minutes.
now,
that's
friday
afternoon
--
last
day
afternoon
after
his
first
arrest.
significantly,
during
that
investigation,
the
sister-in-law
of
the
defendant
was
there.he
was
being
questioned
further
about
the
pistol
and
his
alibi.
he
denied
owning
a
pistol.
at
that
questioning,
an
hour
and
20
minutes,
most
the
sheriff
said,
with
his
sister-in-law
present,
she
confronted
the
petitioner
with
the
fact
that
you
had
a
pistol
in
my
home
last
saturday
night,
the
night
this
murder
was
committed.
and
here
was
petitioner
denying
that
he
owned
a
pistol
or
knew
anything
about
the
pistol.
as
a
result
of
her
confronting
him
with
that
when
she
stated
in
his
presence
--
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
that
you
removed,
i
believe,
he
said,
he
called
the
pistol
at
hand
and
removed
the
nine
cartridges
from
the
pistol
in
her
presence.
as
a
result
of
her
confronting
him,
the
record
shows
that
the
--
two
of
the
deputies
went
down
to
the
defendant's
home
and
found
the
pistol
concealed
by
his
bed
in
the
wall
of
his
home,
22
pistol
as
described
by
the
sister-in-law
and
the
pistol
was
brought
back.
now,
shortly
thereafter,
the
petitioner
was
moved
from
the
judge's
chamber,
not
taken
back
to
the
jail
where
the
crowd
had
gathered,
taken
to
marion
a
little
town
19
miles
away
from
dillon
and
large
there
in
the
marion
county
jail.
there's
no
evidence
of
any
crowd
there.
the
only
reason
he
was
taken
there
was
to
avoid
the
crowd
that
was
at
the
jail
in
dillon.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
testimony
in
the
record
sir
is
that
he
would
remove
from
the
courthouse
to
the
marion
county
jail.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
reason
was
not
given
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
now,
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
sat
in
the
back
seat
of
the
automobile
with
the
petitioner.
he
talked
with
him
on
the
way
to
marion
and
talked
20
or
25
minutes
in
the
marion
jail
yard
and
he
gave
as
the
sheriff
expressed
today,
reasonably
full
confession
sitting
in
the
jail
yard.
now,
i
have
added
up
giving
him
the
benefit
of
every
doubt
where
he
says
15
to
20
minutes,
we've
taken
20
minutes.
the
total
question
in
the
time
this
petitioner
was
arrested
on
5:30
--
at
5:30
thursday
afternoon
until
he
gave
a
reasonably
full
oral
confession
on
friday
was
two
hours
and
30
minutes.
he
missed
no
meals.
he
made
no
request
to
see
anyone.
he
saw
his
wife.
he
saw
his
sister-in-law.
he
was
not
questioned
early
in
the
morning.
he
was
not
questioned
late
at
night.
he
makes
no
contention
that
he
was
denied
any
of
the
comforts
that
he
should
have
had.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
record
shows
that
his
wife
was
arrested
on
thursday
with
him
when
he
was
originally
arrested
and
the
record
shows
that
on
the
request
of
her
sister-in-law
the
next
morning
she
said,
"well,
why
are
you
holding
the
wife?"
the
sheriff
said,
"well,
we'll
release
her."
she
was
released
the
following
morning.
now,
petitioner
takes
the
position
now
that
he
was
held
incommunicado.
there's
not
one
word
in
the
record
that
he
ever
asked
to
see
anyone.
there's
not
one
word
that
he
ever
asked
to
see
an
attorney,
his
own
doctor,
as
the
record
shows
saw
him
on
monday.
now,
on
friday
afternoon
in
marion
jail,
or
early
friday
night,
he
made
a
reasonably
full
oral
confession.
he
was
left
in
marion
county.
the
record
shows,
it
doesn't
say
why
but
the
record
shows
that
there
was
a
crowd
in
dillon
county
and
that
he
was
left
in
marion
county.
sheriff
rogers
testified
that
he
went
back
to
marion
on
saturday
the
next
day
and
had
a
conversation
with
the
defendant,
and
that
he
went
back
on
sunday
and
had
a
conversation
with
the
defendant.
and
on
sunday
night,
he
testifies
that
the
defendant
and
he
got
in
a
discussion
about
the
way
that
the
roads
in
the
cemetery
run.
the
sheriff
was
under
the
impression
--
the
road
turned
in
a
certain
way
and
the
defendant
insisted,
"no,
it
turns
another
way."
so
they
moved
from
marion
over
to
the
dillon
cemetery
and
the
--
and
the
petitioner
gets
out
and
proved
to
sheriff
rogers
that
he
was
right.
sheriff's
testimony
was
that
the
defendant's
says,
"now,
this
proves
i'm
telling
the
truth
that
this
road
runs
exactly
like
i
said."
now,
he
was
kept
in
the
dillon
county
jail
sunday
night
and
monday,
the
day
that
he
--
that's
three
days
after
his
oral
confession.
he
went
--
first
the
--
the
written
confessions
were
prepared.
he
gave
the
information
that
was
written
there
and
they
were
read
over
him,
he
was
given
a
copy
of
it,
he
signed
it
and
--
and
those
two,
they
were
two,
gave
one
then
he
went
to
the
scene
and
reenacted
the
crime
to
the
officers.
he
went
to
the
cemetery
and
told
them
where
the
automobile
was
located.
he
went
and
showed
the
officers
where
the
young
lady
was,
the
victim
on
the
side
of
the
road.
then
after
that,
with
the
officers
present
and
with
his
employer,
mr.
james
moody,
the
man
from
whom
this
defendant
work.
mr.
moody
operated
an
eating
house,
he
was
a
dishwasher
--
dishwasher,
the
petitioner
was.
and
mr.
moody
was
incidentally
also
a
newspaper
reporter
who
reported
this
case.
in
the
presence
of
his
employer
and
the
officers,
he
was
taken
to
the
other
side
of
maple
swamp
where
the
national
guard
searched
all
day
sunday
into
the
seniti
where
this
body
was
finally
found
and
they
searched
all
around
the
area
and
couldn't
find
it.
they
stopped
the
car
200
yards
from
where
the
body
was
found.
the
petitioner
got
out
of
the
car,
led
the
officers
and
his
employer,
the
newspaper
reporter,
straight
to
the
secluded
spot
where
the
body
was
left
and
said,
"this
is
where
i
left
her
body."
and
he
says
that
at
daylight,
she
looked
up
and
saw
me
and
recognized
me.
i
walked
around
behind
her
as
she
sat
on
the
ground
and
shot
her
in
the
top
of
her
head.
now,
he
testified
at
the
trial
that
he
had
never
been
in
the
--
they
had
not
been
in
the
cemetery
or
the
seniti
where
the
body
was
found
at
any
time
within
the
past
year.
and
yet,
he
himself
led
the
officers
to
the
secluded
spot
one
mile
and
a
quarter
from
the
cemetery
where
he
killed
her
at
daylight.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
we
had
no
theory
as
to
motive.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
we
had
no
theory
as
to
motive.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
there
was
no
attempt
to
prove
them
both.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
there
was
no
attempt
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
do
not
know
of
my
knowledge,
the
record
shows
nothing
concerning
any
question
involving
motive.
i'm
satisfied
there
was
no
question
as
to
motive.
now,
we
have
here
a
petitioner
who
was
arrested
5:30
one
afternoon
and
about
24
hours
later,
two
hours
and
thirty-minute
outside,
question.
the
longest
period
being
one
hour
and
twenty
minutes
at
the
outside,
no
coercion,
no
refusal
of
food,
no
refusal
or
denial
of
sleep,
no
unusual
hours,
merely
question
and
he
gives
a
confession
in
24
hours.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
incommunicado,
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
ever
requested
to
see
anyone.
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
asked
for
an
attorney.
the
record
shows
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
his
wife
for
some
time
and
in
the
same
jail
with
her
overnight.
the
record
shows
that
his
sister-in-law
talked
with
him
at
length
in
the
presence
of
the
officers.
there
was
almost
a
parade
of
communication
that
this
defendant
had
in
various
people.
the
record
showed
he'd
been
in
jail
before
he
knew
his
rights.
the
record
shows
that
he
had
ample
opportunity
to
request
counsel
or
request
help.
he
was
denied
nothing.
now,
he
states
at
the
trial
that
he
was
beaten
which
caused
him
to
late
--
this
confession,
24
hours
after
he
was
arrested.
three
days
later,
at
the
trial,
he
made
no
contention
that
he
was
beaten
again.
three
days
later,
he
formally
signs
two
written
statements
and
takes
the
officers
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
reenacts
the
crime
and
leads
them
to
the
spot
where
the
victim
lady
could
not
have
possibly
have
known
had
he
not
been
the
man
who
did
it.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir,
he
testified.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
that
is
less
than
a
mile
from
where
the
body
was
found
and
is
the
place
that
the
petitioner
said
in
his
confession
that
he
went
to
after
he
killed
the
victim,
that
he
went
to
the
trading
post
and
called
a
taxi.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
that
is
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
no,
sir.
the
spot
where
the
body
was
found
is
between
two
roads.
on
one
road
is
cemetery.
on
the
next
road
is
the
trading
post.
in
between
the
two
is
where
he
left
the
body.
in
his
confession,
he
says
that
he
went
to
the
trading
post
and
called
a
taxi.
the
taxi
driver
testified
and
said
as
a
result
of
a
call,
he
went
to
the
trading
post
and
pick
the
defendant
up
and
that
his
clothing
was
wet
from
his
knees
down
and
that
the
defendant
say
he's
been
out
in
the
woods
all
night.
now,
so
this
court
has
held,
time
and
time
again
that
the
interrogation
alone
is
not
sufficient
coercion
to
set
aside
will
make
in
it
--
will
make
involuntary,
a
confession
other
were
--
otherwise
voluntary.
there
is
--
this
court
has
also
held
that
in
considering
whether
or
not
a
confession
is
voluntary
that
you
will
consider
only
the
uncontradicted
evidence.
now,
i
understood
counsel
for
petition
and
to
take
position
that
the
evidence
of
this
petitioner
was
beat
and
could
hardly
walk,
other
evidence
of
brutality
was
not
controverted.
on
page
228
of
the
record,
the
deputy
sheriff
harley
allen
was
asked
specifically
every
question
concerning
every
circumstance
whether
or
not
he
was
beat,
whether
he
could
walk.
every
single
question
that
he
raised
was
asked
in
particularity
of
the
deputy
sheriff
and
he
denied
each
and
every
one.
so
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
dr.
brenwood
(ph)
came
to
the
jail
at
the
defendant
--
at
the
petitioner's
request
on
monday,
examined
him
and
testified
he
saw
no
evidence
of
bruises
or
closed
eye
or
any
other
mistreatment.
we
introduced
in
evidence,
a
picture
of
the
petitioner
which
he
admits
was
made
right
after
he
signed
the
confession
in
the
cemetery.
the
picture
was
made
in
the
cemetery.
and
in
between
two
officers
a
full-face
picture
of
him,
we
say,
showing
no
closed
eye
or
no
bruises
that
shows
a
picture
of
his
left
eye
that
he
claimed
was
closed,
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
they
considered
that
picture
along
with
the
other
evidence
in
determining
whether
or
not
his
confession
was
involuntary.
we
have
the
picture.
this
is
not
the
picture
that
was
marked.
it's
been
lost.
this
is
a
copy
of
the
same
picture.
counsel
agrees
that
it
is
the
same
picture
that
sheriff
and
the
court
desire
to
see
it,
taken
immediately
after
he
signed
his
confession.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
monday.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
he
claimed
he
was
beaten
on
friday.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
our
recollection,
sir
was
that
he
testified
that
he
signed
statements
on
monday
so
he
wouldn't
--
they
wouldn't
get
at
him
anymore.
i
did
not
think
he
testified
that
he
was
beaten.
he
remembered
that
--
his
alleged
beating
on
friday,
did
not
want
that
to
be
considered.
now,
there
isn't
involved
in
this
case
any
dragnet
operations
or
going
out,
surrounding
up
the
people
all
over
the
neighborhood
and
subjecting
them
to
indignities
and
brutalities
in
effort
to
make
one
--
to
make
one
final
confessed
to
stop
the
brutalities.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
in
this
case.
this
defendant
talked
very
freely.
he
made
no
request
for
any
--
any
other
things
that
occur
in
the
other
cases.
he
was
denied
nothing.
he
was
questioned
only
short
periods
of
time.
he
gave
a
full
confession
with
corroboration
with
the
--
with
the
perpetuator
of
this
crime
alone,
he
could
no.
he
said
not
in
a
way
that
he
had
not
committed
the
crime.
the
precautions
taken
by
the
state
to
care
for
this
defendant
were
extraordinary.
he
was
arrested
on
thursday.
he
confessed
on
friday.
he
signed
the
confessions
on
monday,
the
11th.
he
was
on
the
state's
motion
by
the
court,
sent
to
the
south
carolina
state
hospital
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
any
question
about
his
sanity.
that
was
during
the
month
of
august
and
he
was
released
on
september
29th.
on
--
on
august
26,
15
days
after
his
formal
confession,
he
signed
without
request
by
him.
the
circuit
court
of
south
carolina
appointed
two-able-counsel
to
represent
him.
now,
this
appointment
usually
occurs
on
the
commencement
of
court
on
monday.
this
appointment
was
made
on
august
26.
the
court
convened
on
october
20,
nearly
two
months
later.
as
the
record
will
show
that
his
counsel
on
october
7
which
was
17
days
before
his
trial
commenced
that
he
wrote
the
solicitor
of
the
circuit
asking
that
the
prisoner
be
made
available
on
october
7.
by
return
mail
on
october
8th,
the
solicitor
of
the
circuit
wrote
a
letter
to
the
sheriff
with
copy
to
the
petitioner's
counsel
directing
the
sheriff
to
immediately
deliver
the
prisoner
and
make
him
available
to
this
counsel
and
also
to
turn
over
to
the
petitioner's
counsel
every
bit
of
evidence
in
the
hands
of
the
state
of
south
carolina.
now,
we
have
done
everything
that
we
can
to
protect
this
petitioner's
rights.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
you
will
find
--
you
will
find
the
letter
last
referred
to,
sir,
on
page
--
page
16.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
we
have
done
everything
that
we
know
to
protect
this
petitioner's
rights.
he
was
ably
represented.
he
makes
no
claim
that
he
made
request
of
anything
that
wasn't
granted
to
him.
this
court
as
i
understand
it
--
as
i
understand
the
decisions,
read
the
decisions,
we
are
not
denying
the
right
of
interrogation.
we
did
interrogate
the
prisoner
but
we
interrogated
him
consistent
with
all
reasonable
law
enforcement.
and
i'm
quite
sure
that
this
court
realizes
--
i
realized
after
eight
years,
an
office
in
connection
with
law
enforcement
that
the
foundation
on
which
investigation
rest
is
interrogation.
interrogation
of
the
accused,
interrogation
of
witnesses,
that's
the
only
way
the
officers
can
solve
crimes.
we
do
not
believe
in
brutality,
we
--
the
officers
of
this
country
to
my
knowledge,
in
eight
years,
i
have
never
known
of
an
officer
to
be
brutal
to
any
person.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
think
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
believe
--
in
fact
to
the
man
is
illiterate
and
the
member
or
minority
raised
does
have
considerable
bearing
on
--
his
reaction
and
treatment
he
may
get.
we
don't
deny
that
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
anywhere
or
anyone
can
say
amounted
to
any
kind
of
mistreatment
to
this
man.
law
enforcement
officers
can't
turn
a
man
loose
and
say,
"we're
not
going
to
bother
because
you're
illiterate."
there
was
no
advantage
taken
of
him.
he
gave
his
alibi.
first,
he
was
asked,
"do
you
have
a
pistol?"
he
denied
it.
now,
his
sister-in-law
pinned
the
pistol
on
him.
that's
how
the
officers
got
the
pistol.
next,
he
said
he
--
he
gave
an
alibi
and
said
he
was
in
whiteville
with
a
certain
bus
schedule.
the
sheriff
knew
the
bus
schedule
is
impossible.
the
bus
didn't
run
to
whiteville
at
the
time
he
said
it
did.
but
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
went
out
and
investigated
the
bus
schedules
and
investigated
his
alibi
in
every
detail
and
came
back
and
found
that
it
was
not
true.
and
the
defendant
himself
on
the
stand
said
his
alibi
was
not
true.
i
don't
know
what
else
we
could've
done
for
him.
i
agree
with
--
certainly,
the
reasoning
that
an
illiterate
man
is
not
as
well
they
would
take
care
of
himself
with
a
literate
man.
we
don't
question
it.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
their
different
alibi
at
the
trial
would
have
--
at
the
trial,
he
said
that
he
spent
the
entire
night
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
because
he
drank
a
bottle
of
beer
and
he
didn't
want
to
drive
home.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes.
but
he
admitted
at
the
trial
that
he
gave
a
false
alibi
to
the
sheriff.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
investigation
of
--
of
alibis
is
the
--
is
the
one
phase
of
law
enforcement
that
enables
the
innocent
to
be
quickly
and
--
and
speedily
released.
he's
arrested
or
he's
taken
into
custody.
he
gives
an
alibi
to
check.
he
alibi
is
found
to
be
true
and
he
is
released
and
we
serve
society
when
we
do
that.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
disagree
with
mr.
perry.
i
--
in
my
experience
with
the
magistrates,
i
have
never
heard
of
the
south
carolina
magistrate
advising
a
defendant
as
to
his
rights.
there's
no
requirement
that
he
do
so.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
they're
not
required
and
by
customarily
did
not.
generally,
a
magistrate
--
generally,
a
magistrate
does
not
see
the
accused
at
all.
the
magistrate
issues
a
warrant,
the
warrant
is
turned
over
to
the
sheriff,
the
sheriff
puts
the
accused
in
jail.
and
in
99
cases
out
of
100,
the
magistrate
sets
upon
and
that's
all
he
does
in
99
cases
out
of
100.
the
next
morning
or
that
afternoon,
the
accused
is
out
of
bar.
he
never
sees
him
actually.
the
warrant
he
served
on
him.
he's
not
advised.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
strangely,
in
capital
cases,
this
is
custom
to
their
--
sell
them
a
warrant
issue.
there's
never
been
a
warrant
issue
principle
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
--
and
there
never
is
in
most.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
machinery
is
--
is
simply
vested.
the
--
when
a
homicide
occurs,
of
course
they
--
and
i
don't
know
maybe
99
out
of
100
cases.
there
is
no
question
about
who
perpetrated
the
crime
or
the
only
question
is
whether
he
acted
in
self-defense.
the
sheriff
goes
to
the
scene
as
he's
always
called
and
generally,
the
perpetrator
of
the
crime
is
standing
there
with
a
pistol.
he
says,
"here,
sheriff,
he
has
the
pistol,
i
killed
him."
generally,
he
says,
"i
killed
him
myself
and
so
i'm
turning
myself
over
to
you."
sheriff
puts
him
in
jail.
he
isn't
--
he
is
eligible
for
bail
immediately
in
south
carolina.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
he's
eligible
for
bail
immediately.
he
doesn't
have
to
go
for
a
match.
the
circuit
court
sets
the
bail
and
he
is
generally
and
the
homicide
case
at
south
carolina,
the
accused
is
arrested
one
day
and
that
day
or
the
next,
he
is
released
on
bail.
and
generally,
in
eight
years
of
prosecuting
in
four
counties,
there's
never
been
a
warrant
for
a
single
homicide
case
that
i've
tried.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
mr.
justice
frank
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
south
carolina,
my
first
three
years,
we
--our
constitution
provides
that
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
bail
except
in
a
capital
case
where
the
proof
is
evident.
i
have
gone
before
judges
to
three
--
my
first
three
years
trying
to
keep
accused
in
jail
without
bail
and
never
have
succeeded
yet.
so
i
gave
up
on
him.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
constitution
provides
that
the
amount
must
be
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
sir?
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
entitle
bail
except
where
the
proof
is
evident.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
and
i've
never
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
presume
so.
i've
never
even
--
when
we
have
that,
i
have
never
been
able
to
hold
a
defendant
in
south
carolina
without
it.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
well,
if
they
did,
they
would
still
get
bail.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
our
decisions
or
to
this
effect,
on
bail
that
must
be
reasonable
and
the
court
has
held
at
reasonable
means
in
the
amount
the
defendant
can
furnish.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
was
reasonable
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
warning
and
reasonable
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
he
--
he
did
not
--
he
did
not
go
out
in
bail.
he's
never
applied
for
bail.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
every
defendant
in
south
carolina
is
entitled
with
preliminary
hearing
on
replace.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
fairly
often,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
preliminary
hearing
is
before
a
magistrate.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
if
he
--
if
he's
found
over
--
he's
found
over
the
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
there
was
no
preliminary
in
this
case.
there
was
no
request
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
--
the
only
hearing
in
this
case
before
the
court
was
an
inquest.
now,
a
preliminary
hearing
frankly
would
have
served
no
purpose
in
this
case
because
all
the
testimony
was
presented
at
the
inquest.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
oh,
yes.
the
grand
jury
indicted
him.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
24
to
26
hours.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
two
and
a
half
hours
has
given
him
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
in
every
aspect.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
none,
whatever.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
none
that
i
know
of
except
the
sheriff
did
say,
"quincy,
i
don't
believe
you're
telling
me
the
truth"
and
he
then
started
telling
the
truth.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
mr.
justice
black,
he
testified
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
--
the
only
way
to
marion,
they
confessed.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
19
miles.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
19
miles.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
it
does
not.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
jail.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
don't
want
to
get
outside
the
record.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
two
jails
are
on
the
edge
of
dillon.
it
so
happens
that
they
had
--
had
just
completed
a
new
jail
and
they
built
it
right
beside
the
old
jail.
and
we
consider
that
it
was
not
in
the
record.
certainly,
if
there
had
been
a
reason
for
it,
the
petitioner
would've
raised
it
in
this
case.
there
--
there's
no
reason
from
--
we
can't
move
from
one
jail
to
another
except
convenience,
other
prisoners
in
the
jail
and
other
people
milling
around.
they
could
go
to
the
other
building
and
--
and
examine
him
without
being
interrupted.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
to
the
adjoining
county?
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
sheriff
rogers
who
made
the
arrest,
sat
in
the
backseat
with
bullock.
another
officer,
one
of
his
deputies
drove
and
he
testified
that
he
thought
one
other
officer
rode
in
the
front
seat,
three
officers
and
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
occupying
the
same
seat
as
the
sheriff.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
in
marion?
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
mr.
justice
black,
he
was
delivered
there
on
friday
evening
and
returned
on
sunday
evening
to
point
out
where
the
car
was
in
the
cemetery,
from
friday
evening
to
sunday
evening.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
the
sheriff
alone
testified
that
he
went
and
talked
with
him
on
saturday
and
talked
with
him
on
sunday.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
there
was
no
reason
to
assign.
the
testimony
showed
that
it
was
crowd
of
200
or
300
people
at
the
other
jail.
i
can't
go
outside
the
rest.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
and
the
petitioner
testified
that
he
was
no
conscious
of
that.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
about
--
about
5000
or
6000.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
about
the
same.
they
suggested
it
in
the
new
jail
in
dillon
county.
there
was
not
room
--
not
a
room
for
friday
of
questioning.
i
know
not
whether
that
--
that
that's
not
in
the
record.
in
conclusion,
i
merely
want
to
state
and
i
guess
i'm
reiterating
what
i've
said
before.
we
held
this
petitioner
26
hours
at
the
most
before
he
confessed.
we
interrogated
him
two
hours
and
a
half.
there
is
no
claim
of
anything
of
--
anything
that
he
needed,
no
denial
of
truth,
no
denial
of
sleep,
no
unreasonable
questioning,
no
unreasonable
hours.
and
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
under
your
prior
decisions,
as
i
understand
it,
you
have
to
discount
his
claim
that
he
was
beaten
because
that
was
contradicting.
the
only
uncontradict
--
uncontradicted
evidence
is
that
after
two
and
a
half
hours
of
questioning,
he
gave
a
reasonably
full
confession
to
the
sheriff
of
dillon
county
and
we
submit
that
his
trial
was
fair
in
every
respect
and
that
the
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
in
the
jail
yard
before
going
into
jail,
according
to
the
record.
they
sat
in
the
car
about
20
minutes
and
the
sheriff
testified
that
he
then
gave
a
reasonably
full
oral
confession.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
that
i
believe
was
in
the
jail.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
forgot
in
the
record.
i
think
he
--
i
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
he
asked
bullock
about
the
pistol
--
pistol,
said
it
and
bullock
said
he
didn't
own
one
and
the
sheriff
said,
"well,
i
don't
believe
you."
that's
my
recollection
to
that
record.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
that
is
not
what
the
sheriff
refers
to
as
reasonably
full
confession.
he
says
that
he
first
said
that
to
him,
"if
you
say
i've
done
it,
i've
done
it."
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
he
goes
on
and
says
in
the
great
--
in
the
jail
yard,
he
gave
him
a
full
oral
confession.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
i
am
not
sure
whether
that
is
in
marion
or
in
the
courthouse
in
dillon
just
before
going
to
marion,
one
of
those
two
places.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
was
on
the
trip
to
marion.
mr.
robert
l.
kilgo
it's
quite
an
honor.
it's
a
pleasure
sir.
