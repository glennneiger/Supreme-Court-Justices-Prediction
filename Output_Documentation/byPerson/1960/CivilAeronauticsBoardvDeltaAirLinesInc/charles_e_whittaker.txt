justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
this
raises
the
question,
for
me,
as
to
whether
this
is
truly
a
modification.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
a
judgment
is
at
it
and
pursuant
to
law,
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
timely
filed,
that
implies,
doesn't
it,
the
right
of
the
court
to
act
on
the
motion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then,
there
is
no
judgment,
and
there
can
only
be
one
judgment
in
the
case.
and
if
enacting
on
the
motion,
the
court
revises
the
judgment
he
is
to
other,
is
that
a
modified
judge
--
judgment
or
is
it
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
say
take
away
the
rights
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
are
granted?
is
not
the
judgement
always
subject,
mr.
maurer,
to
such
action
as
the
commission
may
properly
take
on
the
motion
for
rehearing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
you
are
using
the
word
"modified".
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
it
your
position
that
once
the
60
days
has
elapsed
and
the
certificate
is
therefore
out,
that
the
commission
in
(inaudible)
lost
the
power
to
rule
on
the
motion?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
then
--
it
--
then
that
means
that
it
had
no
power
to
rule
on
the
motion
because
motions
are
idle
if
it
can't
sustain
it,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
then
your
answer
to
my
--
to
my
question
is
yes,
that
the
board
loses
jurisdiction
to
pass
on
the
motions
the
very
day
that
the
certificate
issues.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
well,
now,
i'm
not
taking
away
if
it
had
--
if
it
has
the
right
to
rule
on
the
motion,
it's
got
a
right
to
do
with
anything,
doesn't
it?
go
--
go
in
the
motion,
it's
got
a
right
to
sustain
the
motion,
if
it's
got
a
right
to
entertain,
doesn't
it?
