justice

are
you
saying
that

i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
in
effect
the
board
has
given
power
to
grant
certificates
that
when
granted
they
must
be
final,
that
they
cannot
retain
by
anything
said
with
reference
to
keeping
an
indefinite
hold
on
it,
that
anytime
in
the
future
we
want
to,
we
can
grant
a
reconsideration?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
is
the
argument?
i
don't
quite
get
it.

it
cannot
retain
power
by
saying
that
anytime
in
the

we
will
do
what
we
placed
to
the
certificate.
justice
hugo
l.

may
i
ask
you,
mr.
davis,
suppose
this
had
said,
i
don't
know
whether
this
has
been
ever
said
or
not,
that
you're
talking
about
a
motion
for
reconsideration.
it's
important
to
get
lines
established.
we're
going
to
grant
certificate
which
we
hereby
view
a
picture
of
this
date,
we
reserved
the
right,
however,
at
anytime
within
two
years
to
change,
alter
or
modify
as
we
see
fit.
could
they
have
done
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
said
within
30
days.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
did
grant
--
it
went
how
long
after
this
was
done
until
they
change
or
modify
the
order,
scope
of
the
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
in
the
seatrain
case,
instead
of
doing
what
they
did,
and
said,
"we
issue
this
certificate
but
we
reserve
the
right
to
reconsider
it
at
anytime
hereinafter
and
change
the
scope."
