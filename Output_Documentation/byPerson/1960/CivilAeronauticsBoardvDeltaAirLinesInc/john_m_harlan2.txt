where
there
further
proceedings
--
arguments
before
the
commission
between
the
issuance
of
the
denial
of
the
stay
order
and
the
granting
of
reconsideration?
justice
john

that
original
has
been
submitted.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
board
have
power
to
issue
provisional
permits?

(inaudible)

(inaudible)
justice
john
m.

did
--
did
you
asked
to
have
the
or
what
position
did
delta
take
on
the
extending
the
date
of
the
certificate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
my
point
is
that
you
--
you
were
on
notice,
it
seems
to
me,
that
whatever
the
risks
were,
your
commencing
operation,
you
were
on
notice
that
that
was
a
possibility
or
a
choice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.

instead

does,
it
said
the
view
of
the
considerations
cited
above
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
they'll
issue
a
temporary
certificate,
does
the
board
had
power
to
do
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
why
isn't
this
inception
just
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
a
matter
of
words
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
could
have
declined
to
take
this
temporary
certificate
if
they
just
(inaudible)
that
route
by
the
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
board's
position
here
was
that
because
of
peculiarities
of
this
situation,
there
was
a
public
interest
in
having
this
service
initiated
immediately.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
they
took
that
into
consideration
and
--
in
deciding
upon
this
procedure
and
that
was
open
to
you,
was
it
not,
if
you
didn't
care
for
that
to
say
no,
we
don't
wish
to
take
the
hazard
of
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
doesn't
that
--
this
present
situation
come
within
the
reservation
of
other
urgent
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
what
is
the
practical
difference
between
what
was
done
here
and
what
your
situation
would
have
been
if
in
issuing
a
certificate,
the
same
day
they'd
issued
a
new
notice
saying
that
we
will
now
proceed
to
consider
--
reconsider
this
matter
on
the
original
record
and
served
you
with
the
notice
under
401
(f).
justice
john
m.
harlan
401
(g).
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
oh,
will
you
prevent
it
from
doing
that
under
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
my
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
--
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
difficulty
is,
i'll
be
quite
frankly
with
you,
my
difficulty
is
it
seems
to
me
that
the
board
was,
as
you
say,
doing
something
that
was
a
departure
of
its
own
practice,
but
your
eyes
were
open
to
it.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
were
put
on
notice
that
whatever
risk
there
were,
standing
on
your
legal
position
that
you
do
now
or
risk
that
you
--
soon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
you
review
this
order
at
the
time,
supposing
you
were
reluctant
about
it,
could
you
petition
for
review
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
on
the
ground
that
the
board
had
no
power
to
issue
such
a
fuzzy
order?
