that
in

brief?

where
is
the

making
power
given

justice

there
is
none.
justice

have
you
got
any
point
of
view?
justice
felix

that's
what
i
want.
justice

now,
what
strength
did

get
out
of

no

power.
justice

what
--
what
specifically
did
get
out
--
out
of
401
(f).
i
mean
what
language
bound

justice

and
this
was
either
suspension

revocation,
is
that

(voice

i
--
i
want
to
stick
close
to

if

may
for
a

in

that's
the

which

to
which
they
stick.
justice

alright.
justice

mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
to
get
the
facts
straight.
at
the
time
the
issue
is
--
at
the
time
of
disposal
rate,
they
(inaudible)
by
the
order
with
which
it
didn't.
they
were
then
attending
these
other
applications
where
they
--
pending
at
the
time.
but
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
this
long-haul
order?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
they,
as
to
those,
that
were
pending
at
the
time
for
long-haul
order
was
--
in
--
under
advisory
or
before
the
board
before
its
final
order?
they
could've
brought
in
those
applications,
could
they
not,
in
the
long-haul
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
as
a
fact,
could
the
--
could
the
commission
have
cleared
them
together?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
actually
pending
while
it
decided
not
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
i
stand
the
second
circuit
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
found
that
the
commission
was
within
its
--
the
board
was
within
its
powers
if
they
had
given
notice
that
they
were
going
to
have
a
hearing
such
as
they
had?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they'll
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
board
is
here
that
instead
of
giving
notice
that
there
were
going
to
give
a
hearing,
they
give
a
notice
to
have
a
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
this
grant
of
delta,
as
the
case
may
be,
suppose
the
--
the
order
is
out,
the
effective
date
is
still
in
the
(inaudible)
the
board
read
in
the
light
of
day
--
the
next
day
what
is
has
done,
and
a
member
of
the
board
says,
"well
(inaudible)
i
think
we
ought
to
reconsider
this."
now,
as
a
result
of
this
decision
(inaudible)
the
board,
what
are
the
--
what
are
the
--
what's
the
freedom
of
the
board
to
deal
with
that
desire
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
does
it
have
to
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
--
i
first
stick
to
what
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
decision
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
--
what
you
are
arguing
for
is
how
it
should
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
they
make
the
modifications,
before
they
make
--
forgive
me,
would
the
--
would
there
be
a
hearing
on
the
terms
of
the
modification?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
specific
parties
were
before
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
other
interested
parties,
were
they
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
those
who
are
affected
by
what
delta
got,
are
they
before
the
board?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
they
could
make
the
modifications
without
any
new
hearing
on
the
materials
before
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
--
how
were
the
parties
know
it
if
they'd
issue
a
modification
without
notice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
in
comparison
with
the
procedure
of
this
court.
were
this
in
a
way
like
a
--
a
petition
for
rehearing
on
certain
alleged
inadequacies
or
errors
in
the
--
in
the
course
of
a
court's
opinion
and
the
court
acts
on
it
without
having
a
separate
hearing
other
than
the
notice
for
--
to
its
attention
by
that
decision,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
it
wasn't
pinpointed.
of
course,
that
remarked
my
imply
that
the
issues
about
which
complaint
is
now
made
weren't
consciously
put
before
the
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
make
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
we
are
dealing
with
a
formal
matter
or
whether
does
this
really
involved
a
neglect
of
substantive
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
had
notice
that
the
board
was
considering
these
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
why
doesn't
--
why
doesn't
it
come
within
the
difficulties
that
the
court
below
found
in
(g)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice

frankfurter

why
aren't
substantive
claims,
notice

hearings,
if
no

is
necessary

of

justice

by

by

justice

--
do
you
mean
it
has
reached
the
terminal
date
of
the
order?
justice

is
there
any
--
is
there
any
escape
clause
in
the
order
--
in
the
order
allowing

specifically
allowing
for
modification

justice
felix

well,
where
is
that?
justice
felix

please
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
please
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
do
that
sua
sponte?
justice

i
was
asking
the
escape

and
the
--
justice

where
is
the

may
i
talk
to
you,
mr.

justice

where
is
the
order
which
is
in

justice

yes.

was

was

there

what

there

given
(voice

--
justice

--
something
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
this
specific
question,
mr.
maurer.
was
there
no
notice
brought
to
delta's
attention?
i
don't
care
what's
the
formality
of
the
documents
were.
had
delta,
not
knowing
after
november
29th,
1958
and
the
7th
of
may
1959,
that
the
board
was
considering
doing
what
they
did
do
in
may
7th
otherwise
into
(inaudible)
was
there
no
--
was
there
no
formal
or
appropriate
official
way
by
which
notice
came
to
you
as
their
counsel,
i
must
say,
that
there
were
contemplating
during
--
what
they
plan
--
what
they
did
on
the
7th
of
may?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
putting
a
stupid
question
maybe.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
was
no
renewal
--
may
i
ask
--
may
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
i
can
get
a
specific
answer.
i
don't
mean
to
say
you're
not
giving
it.
but
was
there
no
renewal
of
notice
to
you
that
the
board
was
re-canvassing
matters
that
you
say
they
could
have
canvassed
to
reside
it
against
you
before
the
order
of
november
29th.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
what
part?
what
do
you
call
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
--
did
they
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
they
say,
perhaps
the
document
would
show,
did
they
say
that
we
may,
in
the
future
(inaudible)
with
this
thing
and
hereby
give
notice
that
we
will?
justice

page

justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
this
can
be
for
--
pending
position
effect
you
directly
and
exquisitely?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you
a
minute
ago
to
say
there
is
nothing
which
directed
special
attention
to
delta.
you
mean
the
order
to
show
stay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying
you're
more
explicitly
that
up
to
the
effective
date,
it
has
full
control,
that
after
the
effective
date,
the
changes
--
it
may
make
changes,
it
has
control
but
the
control
must
be
exercised
under
(g)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
say
--
are
you
saying
or
implying
that
under
the
procedure
that
you're
allowed
into
silence
or
none
act
--
none
intervention,
non
--
non-action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'll
go
straight
on
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

mr.
maurer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
couldn't
possibly
put
myself
in
the
shoes
of
the
management
of
delta,
but
that's
if
not
too
arrogant
of
me
to
put
myself
in
the
shoes
of
their
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
when
you
read
that
last
paragraph,
nothing
in
the
present
order
forecloses
the
board
in
full
and
complete
consideration
of
the
pending
petition
for
reconsideration
on
their
merit
to
a
lot
of
lawyers
who
reflected
on
this
and
said,
"well,
this

what
kind
of
a

this?"
it
may
not
be

you've
made
a
forecast
whether
the

tough

there's

if

it's

you

an

got
a

and
the

the

you
accomplished

accomplish.
justice

i'm

justice
