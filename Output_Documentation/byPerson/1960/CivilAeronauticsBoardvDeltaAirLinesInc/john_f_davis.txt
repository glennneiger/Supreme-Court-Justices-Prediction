mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
case
arises
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
court
upheld
and
attacked
by
delta
air
lines
upon
an
order
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board
which
had
ordered
modifications
in
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
which
had
been
granted
for
some
new
routes.
a
competing
airline
of
--
of
delta,
lake
central,
had
intervened
in
the
court
proceeding
to
review
the
order.
and
both
lake
central
and
the
civil
aeronautics
board
filed
petitions
for
certiorari
to
review
what
it
claimed
as
an
error,
of
course,
involves.
both
petitions
were
granted
and
by
stipulation,
they
have
been
consolidated
for
argument
here.
i
shall
make
the
opening
argument
for
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
then
the
petitioner,
lake
central,
will
follow
me.delta
will
respond
to
both
of
us
at
one
time
and
if
there
is
time,
and
i
think
there
will
be,
i
shall
rebut.
now,
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
in
order
to
preserve
its
jurisdiction
to
consider
motions
for
reconsideration,
must
postpone
the
effectiveness
of
a
certificate
for
public
convenience
and
necessity
or
whether
it
may
permit
that
certificate
to
become
effective
and
then
on
completion
of
its
consideration,
make
a
modification
of
the
effective
certificate.
this
is
purely
a
matter
of
administrative
procedure
of
statutory
construction.
there's
no
question
here
of
constitutionality.
there's
no
question
here
of
evidences,
merely
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
civil
aeronautics
board
has
power
to
modify
an
effective
certificate
of
convenience
and
--
and
necessity
when
that
certificate
was
granted
during
the
pendency
of
motions
for
reconsideration.
now,
here,
the
dispute
is
between
the
--
the
delta
air
lines,
which
is
a
trunk
carrier,
and
two
local
lines,
the
piedmont
and
the
petitioner,
the
lake
central,
both
of
which
operated
local
services
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
--
of
the
great
lakes.
this
case
is
really
a
small
segment
of
a
large
multi-party
proceeding
in
which
the
commission
the
--
the
civil
aeronautics
board
considered
the
necessities
of
additional
routes
to
serve
the
area
between
the
great
lakes
and
florida.
delta
had
applied
for
and
had
been
granted
permission
for
a
new
route
between
detroit
and
miami,
florida.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
has
been
granted
permission
to
serve
several
new
intermediate
routes
on
its
existing
route
between
chicago
and
miami.
these
intermediate
points
which
were
added
to
its
authority
included
indianapolis
and
louisville
and
dayton
among
others.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
court
please,
when
the
board
granted
to
delta
the
authority
for
the
new
through
routes
and
the
new
intermediate
points,
the
result
was
that
delta
was
given
authority
to
inaugurate
new
local
service
between
the
intermediate
points
which
were
added
and
any
other
points
on
their
exiting
lines
or
routes
or
--
or
connecting
routes.
thus,
although
the
main
ground
was
a
new
route
from
detroit
to
--
to
miami,
the
result
of
the
addition
of
these
new
intermediate
points
gave
delta
a
right
to
run
local
service
between
chicago
and
indianapolis
and
between
indianapolis
and
--
and
louisville.
and
this
brought
it
into
conflict
or
at
least
potential
conflict
with
the
local
services
of
piedmont
and
lake
central.
now,
this
had
been
anticipated
because
this
is
--
what
occurs
when
new
routes
are
given.
and
so,
both
piedmont
and
lake
central
had
participated
--
had
intervened
and
participated
in
the
proceeding
in
order
to
introduce
evidence
as
to
their
local
traffic
and
--
and
the
effect
of
the
grants
upon
it.
and
when
the
order
came
down
granting
these
routes
without
any
restriction
on
local
service,
both
piedmont
and
lake
central
filed
motions
for
reconsideration
asking
that
the
board
reconsider
its
order
and
imposed
restrictions
to
protect
their
local
services.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
the
rules
clearly
give
them
a
right
to
do
so,
rule
302.37
of
the
rules
provided.
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
petitions
for
rehearing
but
the
board
has
assumed
that
it
had
power
under
its
general
rule
making
power
and
its
regulations
to
provide
for
rehearing,
and
this
was
filed
in
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
was
no
--
there
is
no
issue
but
--
but
these
were
timely
petitions.
now,
these
were
not
the
only
petitions
for
rehearing,
this
is
a
tremendous
proceeding
in
the
first
place
that
were
10
air
carriers
that
had
made
applications
for
some
party
to
new
routes
and
there
were
party
cities
that
had
--
cities
or
counties
that
had
intervened
and
a
number
of
the
local
carriers.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
had
taken
16,000
pages
and
there
have
been
eight
days
of
trial.
and
after
the
decision
came
down,
there
were
16
separate
petitions
for
reconsideration.
everybody
who
haven't
got
what
he
wanted
immediately
file
the
petition
with
the
board
for
reconsideration
and
rehearing.
the
initial
order
had
provided
that
the
certificates
would
become
effective
60
days
after
the
date
of
the
order.
the
petition
for
reconsideration
came
in
within
the
first
--
as
of
--
provided
by
the
rules
came
in
within
the
first
30
days
of
that
60
days,
and
then
there
were
10
days
for
replies.
this
gave
the
civil
aeronautics
board
20
days
in
which
to
act
upon
these
petitions
for
stay
or
rehearing
reconsideration.
with
an
insufficient
time
for
them
to
pass
finally
on
all
these
matters,
but
they
did,
two
or
three
days
before
the
effective
date
of
the
certifications,
come
down
with
an
order,
it
appears
at
page
57
of
the
record,
in
which
they
passed
upon
the
applications
for
stay
because
obviously,
they
had
the
pass
upon
the
application
for
stay
before
the
effective
date
or
--
or
deny
them
by
not
passing
upon
them.
so,
on
the
28th
day
of
november,
they
came
down
with
a
--
brought
a
long
opinion
passing
upon
these
motions
and
denying
the
stays
as
to
all
but
one
--
in
one
instance.
but
they
said
specifically
in
this
--
in
this
particular
order,
that
they
were
--
they
had
examined
the
--
the
motions
for
rehearing
only
sufficiently
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
sufficient
error
to
justify
staying
the
application
of
the
certificates.
and
they
stated
that
it
was
important
to
get
these
services
started
in
order
to
meet
the
winter
season
to
miami,
and
that
therefore,
they
were
not
going
to
issue
stays
except,
as
i
say
in
this
one
--
one
particular.
but
they
went
on
and
provided,
and
i
now
turn
to
page
79
and
80
of
the
record,
they
provided
in
this
order
that
the
board
would
continue
to
consider
these
petitions
for
reconsideration
and
that
nothing
in
the
present
order
should
foreclose
them
from
full
and
complete
considerations
of
pending
petitions
on
their
merits.
they
particularly
did
not
act
upon
the
merits
at
that
time.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
objection
to
this
type
of
order.
the
certificates
became
effective.
delta
air
lines
started
its
service
between
detroit
and
miami,
and
it
also
instituted
local
service
between
chicago
and
indianapolis
and
local
service
between
indianapolis
and
louisville.
and
then,
some
five
months
after,
the
board
acted
on
the
motions
for
consideration.
and
it
imposed
restrictions
on
these
local
calls
in
order
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
local
carriers
in
its
order
provided
that
the
original
certificate
should
be
amended
so
as
to
prevent
--
what
it
considered
unnecessary
competition
with
these
local
carriers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
were
no
--
no,
well,
not
in
this
particular.
there
were
some
other,
in
other
respects,
there
were
also
some
other
interim
mode
as
modifying
other
certificates.
but
as
to
this,
there
were
no
other
proceedings.
there
were
--
there
were
the
briefs,
of
course,
the
briefs
in
support
of
the
petitions
for
modification
and
against
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
but
they
didn't
--
no
one
filed
that,
so
far
as
i
know
and
i
think
i'm
right,
no
one
filed
any
further
briefs
or
made
any
further
argument
after
the
refusal
of
a
stay.
delta
objected
to
these
modifications
both
on
their
merits
but
particularly
on
the
ground
that
the
board
had
no
authority
to
modify
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
once
it
had
been
granted.
they
asked
rehearing
on
this
and
the
board
denied
it
and
they've
been
petitioned
for
review
in
the
--
originally
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia,
but
it
was
transferred
to
the
second
circuit.
and
there,
the
second
circuit
agreed
with
delta
that
the
civil
aeronautics
board
had
no
power
to
modify
a
certificate
once
it
had
become
effective.
now,
on
its
face,
it
seems
reasonable
to
assume
that
was
--
civil
aeronautics
board,
like
other
administrative
agencies,
should
be
permitted
to
choose
between
granting
a
stay
of
one
of
its
procedures
or
not
when
there's
been
a
timely
petition
for
reconsideration
without
losing
its
--
without
losing
its
authority,
its
power
to
consider
the
--
the
motion.
and
in
fact,
the
court
below
recognized
the
difficulties
which
its
decision
would
impose
on
the
board,
but
it
felt
that
the
statute
itself
was
so
worded
as
to
deny
the
board
this
power.
and
it
found
this
denial
in
two
sections
of
the
act,
sections
401
(f)
and
401
(g)
of
--
of
the
present
federal
aviation
act.
401
(f)
is
a
section
which
provides
that
for
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
on
page
2
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice.
section
401
(f)
is
merely
the
section
which
provides
for
the
duration
of
certificates
of
convenience.
and
it
provides
that
certificates
shall
be
effective
from
the
date
specified
therein
and
shall
continue
until
suspended
or
revoked
as
herein
provided.
and
section
401
(g),
which
appears
on
page
3
of
our
brief,
is
a
procedure
under
which
the
board
on
notice
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
may
suspend,
modify
or
revoked
certificates
of
convenience.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
--
there
is
no
specific
in
the
statute.
there
is
no
rule
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
rule
making
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
yes,
there
is
rule
making
power,
of
course.
it's
given
in
the
section
204
(a),
it's
not
printed
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
but
on
page
13
of
our
brief
in
footnote
8,
there
is
the
except
from
this
section
which
says
that
the
board
is
entitled
to
perform
such
acts
and
make
them
in
such
general
and
special
rules,
regulations
and
procedures
is
necessary
to
carry
out
its
provisions.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
also
section
--
these
--
these
sections
are
excerpt
on
--
excerpted
on
page
15
in
the
footnote
in
our
brief.
there
is
also
a
section
of
the
act
which
gives
them
authority
in
carrying
on
the
hearings
to
conduct
them
in
--
in
appropriate
way.
mr.
john
f.
davis
out
of
the
board?
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
delta
--
the
court
--
the
court
felt
that
(f)
said
that
these
certificates
should
be
perpetual
until
they
were
modified
as
provided
by
(g).
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
language
that
they
rely
on
is
in
--
it's
in
the
second
and
third
line,
"shall
continue
in
effect
and
held
suspended
or
revoked
as
herein
provided.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
felt
that
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
argue
this.
we
--
they
--
when
it
says
"shall
continue
in
effect,"
why,
they
argue
that
it
shall
continue
in
effect
without
modification.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
then
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
is
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then
they
turned
to
(g).
and
(g)
says
that
you
--
in
order
to
modify,
suspend
or
revoke,
you
have
to
give
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
special
procedure.
so
they
don't
deny
that
the
board
could
have
modified
this
effective
certificate,
but
they
said
they
would
have
to
start
a
new
proceeding
to
do
so.
they
would
have
to
give
--
give
them
notice
and
opportunity
to
introduce
evidence.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
this
--
this
is
an
added
--
it's
an
added
restriction.
it's
certainly
the
--
certainly
in
--
in
essence,
the
certificate
remains
in
effect
and
is
--
is
--
with
--
with
additional
restrictions,
and
it
--
it
certainly
is
not
revoked
to
suspend
it
but
it
may
be
that
--
that
they
don't
have
the
same
rights
under
it
and
certainly,
it
don't
have
the
same
rights
under
it
that
they
have
to
regulate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
will
then
be
the
judgment.
it
won't
be
a
modified
judgment.
i
--
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
what
was
done
in
this
case
was
neither
suspension
nor
revocation.
and
it
--
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
covered
by
(f)
at
all.
i
think
our
argument
goes
further
however
because
when
some
of
this
motions
for
reconsideration
that
were
pending
did
go
to
the
heart
of
some
of
the
--
of
the
rights
to
continue
when
the
board,
in
its
assumed
authority,
would
have
felt
that
it
could
suspend
the
entire
--
the
entire
authority.
it
didn't
--
it
didn't
act
in
the
ground
that
this
is
a
minor
amendment,
it
acted
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
final
order,
and
that
since
it
had
made
its
--
under
this
circumstances,
it
would
have
power
to
--
to
amend
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon.
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
there
were
two
things
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
there
were
two
--
two
things
pending
at
that
time.
one,
there
were
existing
authorities
to
piedmont
and
lake
central
to
do
some
of
this
local
operation.
they
had
separated
out
of
this
--
out
of
this
proceeding,
and
there
had
been
commenced
a
new
local
service
proceeding
with
applications
by
these
--
by
these
companies
for
local
--
for
additional
local
service.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
originally
--
originally
these
local
carriers
had
attempted
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
come
in
and
make
their
proceedings
part
of
this
proceeding.
this
--
this
area
of
proceedings
are
almost
impossibly
complex
anyway.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
it
could.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
separated
them
and
put
them
into
a
separate
proceeding.
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
if
--
yes
they
would
found
if
they
had
been
a
special
proceeding
for
modifications
and
revocation
on
notice.
there
would've
said
they
had
power
to
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
think
there
may
be
a
little
misunderstanding
between
us,
mr.
justice.
the
--
the
conflict
between
piedmont
and
lake
central
and
--
and
delta
doesn't
center
only
on
the
new
applications
of
delta
and
piedmont.
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
we
could
--
we
could
almost
ignore
those
because
the
--
they
are
a
fact
of
two
but
the
result
would
be
the
same
with
respect
to
the
protection
of
the
existing
certificates
of
these
two
companies
which
were
being
affected
by
this.
and
as
to
those,
of
course,
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
pending
hearing
or
argument.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
that's
true.
it's
explicitly
recognized
in
the
--
when
--
in
connection
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
--
and
for
all
three
of
its
sections
and
it's
explicitly
recognized
in
connection
with
the
--
with
the
communications
commission.
i
think
most
of
the
regulatory
statutes
do
provide
these
specific
regulations.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
isn't
any
indication
of
why
it
--
it
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
there
is
really
no
significance
to
it.
i
think
that
--
well,
it's
generally
assumed
that
the
power
to
decide
has
--
gives
you
a
power
to
--
if
you'd
made
a
mistake
to
--
and
someone
calls
the
attention
to
reconsider
it
and
collect
--
correct
it.
and
the
courts
have
said
that
this
is
inherent
in
the
rule
making
power
without
any
specific
authority.
i
--
i
have
no
reason
--
no
understanding
of
why
they
left
it
out
of
this
particular
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
left
it
out
again.
they
left
it
out
originally
in
the
--
in
the
1938
act,
and
they
left
it
out
--
what's
more
when
--
when
they
reenacted
the
act
in1958
so
no
one
apparently
learn
about
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
proceeding
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it's
both.
this
act
--
this
case
begins
with
the
1938
act,
the
--
the
cia
and
it
was
completed
under
the
faa.
the
statutes
are
identical.
there's
no
--
there's
no
problem
between
the
two.
mr.
john
f.
davis
freedom
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
board
could
--
could
do
this,
it
could,
on
its
own
motion,
enter
not
a
thing.
it
was
going
to
reconsider
its
--
its
previous
order,
and
it
could,
if
it
desired,
extend
the
effective
date
for
the
certification
of
the
route
because
the
very
--
the
certification
itself
contains
a
provision
that
they
could,
if
they
desired,
postpone
the
effectiveness
of
the
--
of
the
certificate
or
it
could,
if
we
are
right
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
what
it
could
not
do,
under
the
limitations
of
the
proceeding
below,
what
it
could
not
do
would
be
to
--
the
second
thing
it
could
do
would
be
to
hurry
up
and
get
this
thing
done
before
the
effective
date.
but
what
it
could
not
do
would
be
to
let
the
new
order
become
effective
and
then
modify
it.
that's
all
it
could
do.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
it
should
have
--
that
generally
speaking,
administrative
bodies
and
courts
have
a
power
to
stay
or
not
to
stay
while
they
reconsider.
that
in
this
case,
the
board
gave
very
serious
considerations
of
the
nature
of
the
complaints
and
they
felt
that
is
was
more
important
to
get
this
service
started
immediately
then
to
be
absolutely
sure
whether
there
was
anything
that
should
be
changed.
and
they
said,
"you
--
you
want
to
go
ahead,
you
can
go
ahead
but
we
are
still
considering
whether
or
not
there
should
be
some
further
modifications."
and
we
think
they
should
have
power
to
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
no.
there
wouldn't
need
to
be
in
this
case.
and
--
and
i
think
that's
very
important
because
i
think
that
may
be
why
the
--
why
the
court
felt
there
should
be
a
separate
proceeding.
here,
we
have
record.
the
--
this
issue,
the
issue
of
the
local
--
protection
of
the
local
traffic
was
part
of
the
main
proceeding
and
evidence
was
introduced
by
both
lake
central
and
--
and
piedmont
on
this
very
issue
and
--
and
could
have
been
answered
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
both
of
them
were
before.
yes,
the
specific
parties
were
before
the
board.
mr.
john
f.
davis
delta
was
--
oh,
yes,
delta
--
this
was
in
connection
with
delta's
application.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
they
were
all
before
the
board.
mr.
john
f.
davis
all
the
parties
were
before
the
board
that
are
here
now
and
more
because
piedmont
isn't
here
now.
so
the
evidence
was
here
on
this
issue
before
the
cab.
now,
it
wasn't
pinpointed
as
to
these
particular
localities
because
the
routes
hadn't
been
granted.
but
as
soon
as
the
routes
were
granted,
then
lake
central
and
piedmont
made
their
motion
for
reconsideration
and
call
to
the
attention
of
all
the
parties
their
particular
objection.
at
that
time,
if
the
record
wasn't
sufficient
if
you
didn't
--
didn't
have
sufficient
evidence,
then
the
record
could
have
been
enlarged
to
put
it
in.
no
one
asked
them
to
do
that,
everyone
assumed
the
record
was
--
was
complete.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
unless
one
of
the
parties
said
they
needed
more
material
and
then
there's
no
reason
they
couldn't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
--
here,
there
was
--
there
was
notice.
i
mean
the
--
there
was
of
--
of
--
there
was
a
motion
for
a
modification,
there
was
a
reply
to
it
saying,
"don't
modify
it."
and
at
this
time,
one
could've
--
i
said,
and
we
want
to
put
in
more
evidence
on
this
issue
if
you're
--
if
you're
considering
it.
but
no
one
did,
everyone
was
satisfied
with
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right,
your
honor.
if
this
court
feels
that
the
particular
issue
hasn't
been
sufficiently
explored,
it
can
--
it
can
have
reargument,
it
can
send
it
back
for
new
evidence
if
it
feels
its
necessary.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
well,
they
--
i
cannot
say
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
cannot
say
that
at
the
time
the
evidence
was
introduced
that
there
was
specific
evidence
with
respect
to
--
there
are
10
--
10,000
cities,
10
short
routes.
i
cannot
say
that
there
was
evidence
introduced
on
each
one
of
those
10.
may
be
counsel
for
lake
central
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it's
entirely
a
formal
matter
because
if
this
record
wasn't
sufficient,
there
was
plenty
of
opportunity
for
them
to
make
it
sufficient
and
plenty
of
notice
as
to
what
they
were
talking
about
through
the
motion
for
reconsideration
which
did
pinpoint
the
particular
area
that
they
were
attacking.
and
there
was
no
reason
why
either
one
of
the
parties
shouldn't
have
--
move
to
reopen
the
record
if
they
felt
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
before
the
court
--
the
board
decide
these
things.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
the
board
--
the
board
said,
in
its
order,
it
said,
"we
are
considering
these
matters
and
we
will
come
down
with
the
decision
later
on
the
merits."
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
say
why
--
why
isn't
this
in
effect
the
proceeding
under
(g)?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
because
it's
already
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
this
is
the
complete
answer
to
the
--
to
what
the
court
said
below
that
they
have
received
all
of
the
protection
they
would
have
received
through
a
new
proceeding
under
(g),
except
that
it
can
be
done
promptly
and
--
and
they
can't
continue
to
have
this
operation
during
a
--
during
the
time
the
new
procedure
would
be,
would
be
held
which
is
something
--
which
presumably
is
not
in
the
public
interest
if
the
board
is
correct
in
its
ultimate
findings
than
in
ours.
counsel
for
lake
central
will
continue.
and
then
if
there's
time
left,
i
will
save
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
in
response
to
a
question
about
whether
all
of
the
administrative
agencies
--
whether
administrative
agencies
generally
were
given
power
for
--
to
rehear.
the
solicitor
general
has
called
my
attention
that
there
is
no
specific
power
for
rehearing
in
the
statutes
dealing
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
probably
not
with
respect
to
the
federal
trade
commission.
and
as
i
recollected,
there
is
no
such
provision
neither
with
respect
to
securities
and
exchange
commission.
so,
i
would
--
i
would
"hazardly"
guessed
that
there
was
a
period
in
the
early
1930s
when
there
was
a
series
of
this
--
some
of
these
statutes,
because
federal
trade
commission
goes
earlier
than
that
when
they
didn't
make
any
provision
for
rehearing.
on
the
other
hand,
with
respect
to
the
federal
power
commission,
there's
not
only
a
provision
a
rehearing,
but
there
is
a
requirement
that
they
petitioned
for
rehearing
because
they
could
seek
judicial
review
so
that
not
only
do
they
authorized
the
requirement.
mr.
maurer
pointed
out
that
one
circumstance
under
which
effective
certificates
would
be
modified
would
be
in
a
situation
where
there
was
a
--
application
for
review
to
a
court,
and
a
court
in
reviewing
the
order
found
that
it
was
defective
in
some
way
and
ordered
a
change.
this
points
up
the
--
the
difficulty
in
this
case.
let
us
assume
that
lake
central
and
piedmont
came
to
the
--
to
the
civil
aeronautics
board
and
convinced
them
that
their
order
was
wrong
after
--
after
it
become
effective.
does
this
mean
that
they
would
have
to
say,
"we're
sorry,
we
can
do
nothing
about
it,
you
have
to
go
to
court
to
get
an
order
for
us
to
do
something
about
it,
but
if
you
do
go
to
a
court
and
get
an
order,
then
we
can
do
it."
in
other
words,
what
mr.
maurer
is
saying
that
the
board
cannot
do
it
voluntarily,
but
it
can
do
it
by
--
when
--
when
it's
been
litigated
and
ordered
to
do
so
and
this
--
this
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
you
can
--
yes
--
well,
no,
not
well
it'd
be.
in
order
to
review
the
order
of
the
--
of
the
cab,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it
--
in
this
case
that
lake
central
can't
come
to
the
cab
and
said
to
cab,
"you
made
a
mistake,
you
should
have
put
this
in."
and
cab
said,
"yes,
we
did
make
a
mistake.
it's
wrong
and
we
should
put
it
in
to
protect
you,
but
we
can't
do
it
without
an
order."
then
it
--
they
went
in
the
court,
and
said,
"legally,
cab
couldn't
do
this.
cab
would
have
to
say
yes,
we
couldn't.
we
did
--
we
made
a
mistake,"
then
there
would
be
an
order
and
then
they
would
be
able
to
do
it.
in
other
words,
they
would
go
through
--
they
wouldn't
contest
the
matter
in
--
in
court.
they
would
just
be
requiring
a
court
order
to
do
something
they
couldn't
do
voluntarily.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
not
--
it's
not
impossible
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
in
this
case,
it's
not
--
it
wouldn't
been
contested.
in
this
case,
they
would
say
"yes,
you
are
right,
we
should
have
put
this
restriction
in.
legally,
under
the
evidence,
we
should
have
done
it."
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
the
time
has
expired.
so
they
get
an
extension
of
time
in
effect
by
going
to
court
in
getting
an
order.
it
doesn't
really
make
any
sense.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
because
according
to
--
according
to
mr.
maurer,
because
under
the
statutes,
once
you
--
you
can
modify
it
by
going
to
court
and
getting
a
court
order,
then
you
can
modify
an
existing
certificate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
court
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
court
--
the
court
order
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
would
modify
it,
but
the
court
order
would
order
the
board
to
modify
and
then
it
would
get
a
section.
now,
i
want
to
say
one
more
to
--
about
the
administrative
procedure
of
the
board.
the
board
has
asserted
this
power
to
modify
existing
certificates.
from
time
to
time,
from
1947
through
1959,
they
have
not
followed
this
practice
as
an
--
as
a
--
as
a
general
practice,
it's
a
--
it's
concededly
a
better
thing
before
a
certificate
becomes
effective
to
have
the
--
to
have
the
legal
matters
cleaned
up.
but
they
have
in
situation
such
as
this,
where
they
had
felt
that
it's
important
to
get
the
service
they
have
from
1947
to
1959,
from
time
to
time,
exercised
this
authority
in
the
cases
in
which
they
have
done
so,
it's
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
18.
so
insofar
as
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
general
--
yes.
yes,
in
this
sense,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
board
recognizes
as
everybody
else
does
that
it
is
better
when
you
can
to
clear
up
all
of
the
legal
problems
in
these
cases
before
the
certificate
is
issued.
it's
the
same
is
--
with
the
federal
communications
commission
or
the
other
boards
that
when
people
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
normally,
it
has
done
so.
mr.
john
f.
davis
normally,
it
will
extend
the
time
so
that
it
can
do
so.
and
it
would
have
done
so
here
except
for
the
specific
reasons
which
it
stated
in
its
order.
and
--
and
it
felt
that
there
weren't
sufficient
errors
--
sufficient
chance
of
error
to
make
it
necessary
to
stay
the
orders
and
that
it
was
important
to
get
the
service
in
--
into
operation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
think
it
appears
in
--
in
normal
certificates.
it
appears
in
most
--
it's
a
procedure
to
give
themselves
power
to
extend
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
if
they
need.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
yes,
it
is.
i
--
i
--
this
is
--
this
is
another
way
of
handling
the
situation
and
it
is
in
the
normal
situation
the
preferable
way
of
handling
the
situation
to
postpone
the
effective
date
and
to
get
the
legal
problems
cleared
up
before
the
operation
starts.
in
--
in
some
other
cases,
it's
even
more
important,
i
mean
there's
a
pipeline
case
here
a
few
years
ago
where
the
pipeline
was
in
the
--
in
the
ground
before
the
final
order
was
--
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
finally
upset.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
i
--
i
was
referring
to
the
provision
in
the
certificate
of
--
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
john
f.
davis
alright.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
no.
that
is
--
that
isn't.
i
may
have
misunderstood.
i'm
refer
--
i
was
referring
to
the
provision
in
the
certificate
which
gave
a
right
to
extend
the
--
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
effective
date
of
the
certificate.
no,
this
is
the
particular
order
made
on
these
particular
facts.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
insofar
as
i
know,
we
cite
the
only
cases
where
this
--
where
there's
been
a
modification
afterwards.
they
may
have
been
some
of
these
cases
by
the
way
they
reserve
the
power
and
then
didn't
modify
it
like
the
kansas
city
case
that
was
referred
to
awhile
ago.but
in
at
least
five
cases,
they'd
reserved
this
power
and
have
in
fact
modified
it
after,
which
notes
are
cited
at
page
18
of
our
--
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
is
the
unusual
situation
when
they
do
it.
but
they
--
they
have
done
it
in
the
past
and
they've
always
claimed
the
right
to
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
at
least
let's
--
let's
have
them
to
the
--
to
the
carrier
in
--
in
accepting
this
--
this
kind
of
a
certificate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
urgency.
that
bears
on
their
discretion
on
whether
--
if
--
if,
for
example,
they
have
thought
that
they
had
really
made
a
mistake
in
--
in
granting
one
of
these
through
routes,
they
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
delta
to
--
to
invest
in
a
large
number
of
planes
to
--
to
do
it.
if
--
if
at
that
time
they
felt
that
it
was
--
that
it's
probable
if
they
would
never
let
them
use
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
there
--
there
were
14
petitions
for
re
--
for
rehearing
on
all
of
the
--
of
the
substance
of
this
--
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
couldn't
have
done
that
now,
under
your
seatrain
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
not
if
there
were
no
--
if
there
are
provision
for
rehearing,
i
suppose
up
to
the
period
that
people
could
file
for
rehearing,
it
could
have
been
opened
up
with
the
commission
itself,
couldn't
reserve
power
without
going
to
141
(h)
a
new
--
a
new
proceeding.
mr.
john
f.
davis
oh,
that
--
they
did
--
that's
actually
five
months
after
the
--
after
the
thing
became
effective.
this
was
--
this
was
--
we
believe
because
it
never
became
finally
effective.
the
--
the
suggestion
you
made,
if
i
understood
your
question,
mr.
justice,
was
a
final
order
by
the
board
attempting
to
reserve
the
power
to
change
it
in
the
future.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
the
--
the
provisions
for
reconsideration
is
contained
in
the
statute.
and
they
couldn't
have
done
that.
they
couldn't
match
the
statute.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
they
would
have.
the
--
if
the
--
if
the
lines
--
the
lines
could
have
moved
to
get
it
cleared-up,
i
mean
they
could
have
moved
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
from
mandamus
for
--
for
an
order
and
it
pressed
the
board
for
--
for
a
decision.
but
the
--
there
were
still
have
been
no
final
order
as
--
under
our
argument.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
no,
you
--
you
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
can't
do
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they
couldn't
fight
deviousness
if
they
wish
to
take
a
motion
for
reconsideration
and
put
it
on
the
shelf
and
say,
"we
are
going
to
save
ourselves
power
to
--
to
change
this
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
we've
got
a
pending
motion
and
then
not
act
on
it."
they
could
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
and
there
might
length
of
time
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
when
it
would
be
unreasonable.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
is
a
modification
--
it
is
a
modification
of
a
certificate
under
which
someone
is
operating,
and
that
--
and
that
to
that
degree
is
extended
as
it
is.
