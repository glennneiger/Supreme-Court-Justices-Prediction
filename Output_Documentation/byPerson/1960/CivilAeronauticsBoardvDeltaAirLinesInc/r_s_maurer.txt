mr.
r.
s.
maurer
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
in
order
to
bring
the
few
remarks
that
delta
would
like
to
present
to
you
in
the
proper
focus,
let
me
just
restate
this
question
once
again
because
it
is
a
fairly
limited
question
of
the
proper
construction
of
a
specific
statutory
provision.
the
question
is
simply
whether
after
civil
aeronautics
board,
by
affirmative
action,
has
deliberately
made
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
effective
on
a
given
day.
and
let
me
just
interrupt
myself
to
say
that
mr.
davis
frequently
used
the
word
"grant"
by
the
board.
we
are
not
debating
anything
about
the
board's
original
order
which
issued
the
certificate.
we
are
talking
about
the
specific
day
on
which
the
certificate
became
effective
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
language.
the
question
presented
is
whether
after
that
certificate
has
become
effective
in
accordance
with
an
ordered
issued
by
the
board
specifying
the
effective
date.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes
your
honor.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
it
has
reached
the
date
on
which
the
board
has
said
that
capital
may
be
invested
and
service
may
be
started.
in
other
words,
the
carrier
now
has
legal
authority
to
inaugurate
service.
once
this
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
is
correct.
it
could
be
longer.
for
example,
in
a
now
pending
case,
the
southern
transcontinental
case,
the
board
allowed
itself
90
days.
so
that
it
would
have
rather
a
30-day
period
for
examination
of
these
petitions
for
reconsideration
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
in
60
days.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
indeed
so.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
board
has
at
least
four
or
five
different
avenues
which
it
can
take
to
avoid
during
what
it
did
in
this
case
and
putting
a
carrier
such
as
delta
in
a
desperate
position
of
having
invested
a
great
sums
of
money
following
the
effective
date
only
to
have
portions
of
the
certificate
authority
removed
some
five
months
later.
for
example,
specifically
responding
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
brennan,
one
thing
that
the
board
normally
does
is,
justice
stewart
indicated,
is
to
allow
itself
a
60-day
period
which
gives
20
days
for
petitions
for
reconsideration
to
be
filed,
10
days
for
answer
and
30
days
for
action
by
the
board
before
the
certificate
becomes
effective.
in
complex
cases
such
as
the
southern
transcontinental
case,
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
it
allows
itself
90
days
so
that
there
will
be
again
20
days
for
petitions
for
reconsideration,
10
days
for
answers
but
60
days
for
action
by
the
board
after
all
pleadings
have
been
filed.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
may
i
add
just
two
more
points,
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
as
to
what
board
may
do
and
then
respond
to
your
question?
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
frequently
in
the
past,
as
the
board
came
up
close
to
the
effective
date
of
a
certificate
and
recognized
that
it
had
not
had
time
to
give
the
serious
considerations
of
these
petitions
which
it
wished
to
do.
it
then
issued
an
order
extending
that
effective
date
so
that
the
certificate
would
not
become
effective
in
the
rights
vested.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
it
can
do
it
on
its
own
motion
or
it
can
do
it
in
response
to
the
petitions.
in
this
case,
lake
central
had
specifically
--
specifically
moved
the
board
to
put
that
effective
date
in
a
stayed
condition
until
a
petition
for
reconsideration
was
acted
upon,
and
by
its
order,
the
board
said,
"no,
we
will
not.
we
will
allow
the
certificate
to
become
effective
because
we
want
the
carriers
to
start
the
service."
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
indicated
there
were
four
ways
that
the
board
could
handle
the
situation
and
the
fourth
is
responsive
to
what
you
have
in
mind,
sir.
the
fourth
way
in
which
they
can
handle
this
situation
is
that
as
they
come
up
to
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate,
if
there
are
certain
services
which
there
is
some
strong
public
urgent
need
for
or
some
reason
of
national
defense,
and
they
have
finished
their
reconsideration
there,
but
there
are
other
areas
where
they
do
not
feel
that
they
have
had
sufficient
time
to
complete
reasonable
reconsideration.
they
can
allow
the
portions
or
all
of
the
certificates
on
which
they
have
completed
their
action
to
become
effective
but
stayed
or
remained,
and
they
have
done
that
repeatedly
in
the
past.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
we
did
not
respond,
as
i
recall,
to
the
suggestion
that
the
certificate
date
would
be
stayed.
we
did
respond
on
the
merits
arguing
that
these
restrictions
should
not
be
imposed.
in
other
words,
we
responded
on
the
merits
rather
than
on
the
procedural
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
is
the
second
part
of
my
argument,
and
i'm
sorry,
i
still
haven't
responded
to
justice
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
frankfurter's
question,
which
has
escaped
me,
i
--
i
beg
your
pardon
for
asking
again.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
let's
see
if
i
can
find
the
opinion
as
written.
this
type
of
clause
you're
speaking
of
normally
comes
in
the
certificate
actually
issued
to
the
carrier.
now,
this
certificate
begins
at
page
54
of
the
record,
and
the
language
to
which
i
would
refer
you
is
at
page
56.
this
is
the
certificate
which
was
issued
to
delta
and
which
is
in
issue
here.
and
on
page
56
in
the
third
full
paragraph,
you
will
see
this
language,
"this
certificate,
as
amended,
shall
become
effective
on
november
29,
1958
provided,
however,"
and
here
is
the
crucial
language
that,
"prior
to
the
date
on
which
this
certificate,
as
amended,
had
otherwise
become
effective,"
the
board,
"either
on
its
own
initiative
or
upon
a
timely
filing
of
a
petition
or
petition
seeking
reconsideration
insofar
as
such
order
authorizes
the
issuance
of
this
certificate,
as
amended,
made
by
order
or
orders
extends
such
effective
date
from
time
to
time".
there
in
lies
exactly
the
thing,
which
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
board
has
utilized
repeatedly
over
a
period
of
some
13
years
to
extend
the
effective
date
if
it
found
it
necessary
in
order
to
do
justice
to
the
parties.
and
the
board
specifically
did
not
exercise
that
power
in
this
case.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
certainly.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
it
--
it
--
the
order
which
attempted
to
take
away
the
authority.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
it
begins
at
page
81
of
the
record
and
the
actual
part
of
the
order
which
takes
away
delta's
operating
authority
in
a
local
basis
in
this
10
markets
is
on
page
87.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
we
--
we
take
the
position
that
the
hearing
required
by
statute
was
not
granted.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
what
--
what
happened
was
that
under
section
401
(f)
of
the
statute,
which
mr.
davis
read
to
you,
the
certificate
became
fully
effective.
now,
section
401
(f),
and
let's
just
look
at
that
language
for
a
moment,
sir
says,
"each
certificate
shall
be
effective
from
the
dates
specified
therein
and
shall
continue
in
effect
until
suspended
or
revoked
as
hereinafter
provided."
now,
the
hereinafter
provided
is
only
one
of
two
ways.
one
is
under
section
1006
of
the
statute
which
provides
for
judicial
review,
that
is
clearly
not
involved
here.
the
second
is
under
sectio
401
(g),
the
very
next
section
of
the
statute,
which
grants
the
board
authority
to
modify,
suspend
or
revoke
an
effective
certificate
following
a
notice
from
hearing
procedure.
now,
following
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate,
there
was
no
notice
or
hearing
under
section
401
(g),
and
we
are
all
in
agreement
on
that.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
the
board
was
purport
--
pardon
me
sir,
the
board
was
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
thought
that
was
quite
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
i
thought
that
was
quite
confusing
myself.
what
the
reference
there
was,
was
back
to
the
original
hearing
as
a
result
of
which
the
board
issued
the
certificate
in
september
of
1958.
now,
in
that
original
hearing,
there
is
no
question
that
lake
central
presented
evidence
as
to
why
a
restriction
of
this
type
should
be
imposed.
delta
responded
to
it,
and
the
board
did
not
impose
that
sort
of
restriction.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
a
couple
of
points
right
there.
this
was
no
inadvertent
or
clerical
error.
i
--
i
got
a
feeling
from
my
brother
grisard's
argument
that
he
was
now
raging
upon
this
court
that
there
was
a
--
an
inadvertent
error
here
which
the
board
was
purporting
to
correct.
well,
i
--
i
take
diametrically
the
opposite
view
point
until
today.
it
--
it
had
never
entered
my
mind
that
anyone
contended
in
this
case
that
there
was
fraud
or
misrepresentation
or
inadvertent
or
clerical
error.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
mr.
justice,
i
--
i'll
try
to
answer
your
question.
i
am
not
trying
to
avoid
it
by
the
way
i
start
out.
it
is
our
position
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
no,
sir.
i
--
i've
got
to
impose
the
effective
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
date
of
the
certificate
in
the
middle
of
these
things.
under
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
has
filed
and
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate,
i
agree
that
the
board
could
have
done
what
it
did.
my
position
is
purely
and
simply
that
once
the
certificate
became
effective
in
accordance
with
the
statutory
language
by
specific
order
of
the
board,
the
board
had
foreclosed
itself
from
taking
authority
away
from
us
on
this
--
all
petitions
for
reconsideration.
but
up
until
the
effective
date,
the
board
could
do
that,
and
it
would
have
been
perfectly
proper
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
sure.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
two
things,
your
honor.
number
one,
after
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate,
there
was
no
further
notice,
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
number
two,
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate,
our
opponents
argue
that
by
this
language,
which
the
board
put
in
its
order
denying
the
stay
of
the
effective
date,
it
put
us
on
notice
that
it
might
do
something
in
the
future.
my
response
to
that
is
that
the
board
cannot,
by
putting
in
the
dicta
part
of
its
decisional
process,
not
even
in
the
ordering
part
but
in
the
dicta
part,
a
statement
that
we're
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
--
dicta
is
a
poor
word.
in
the
introductory
part
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
in
the
introductory
part,
before
it
comes
to
the
ordering
clauses,
a
statement
that
maybe
will
violate
the
law
sometime
in
the
future.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
--
that's
not
a
notice.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
not
if
you
want
to
focus
on
the
delta
point
as
such.
but
what
they
did
say
was
this.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
sir,
i've
got
to
find
it
myself.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
58,
i
believe.
no.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
sir,
we're
at
page
80.
we
feel
that
such
action
as
is
necessary
to
a
fair
consideration
of
a
stay
request,
and
this
is
in
no
way
prejudicial
to
the
legal
rights
of
those
parties
seeking
reconsideration.
nothing
in
the
present
order
forecloses
the
board
from
full
and
complete
consideration
of
the
pending
petitions
for
reconsideration
on
their
merits.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
oh,
yes,
indeed.
the
petition
which
has
filed
by
lake
central,
asking
for
reconsideration,
asked
for
the
imposition
of
the
restrictions
which
the
board
subsequently
tried
to
impose
some
six
or
seven
months
later.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
no.
this
--
this
was
a
catch-all
phrase
which
applied
--
oh,
i
see
what
the
problem
is.
this
order
doesn't
deal
just
with
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
affecting
delta.
there
were
--
i'm
going
to
cite
just
10
or
12
different
applicants
for
major
routes
on
this
case,
and
i
guess
there
were
petitions
for
reconsideration
filed
against
all
the
awards
that
were
made.
there
were
three
major
routes
awarded
from
the
great
lakes
area
to
florida,
northwest
from
chicago
to
florida,
delta
from
detroit
to
florida
and
capital
from
the
buffalo
pittsburgh
area
to
florida.
all
of
these
were
subject
to
petitions
for
reconsideration.
and
here,
the
board
was
applying
this
overall
language
to
all
of
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
because
it
hadn't
dealt
with
any
of
them.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
is
correct.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
indeed.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
indeed.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
indeed,
and
we
responded
to
it
in
an
answer.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well,
my
--
my
response
to
that,
and
i
perhaps
ought
to
give
the
court
the
benefit
of
a
little
more
background
than
it
had
in
the
way
the
board
has
treated
these
particular
sections
of
the
statute.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
for
something
in
excess
of
13
years,
i
think
longer,
the
board
has
consistently
treated
this
statute,
in
my
opinion,
in
the
manner
for
which
i
argue.
and
it
has
recognized
both
in
its
own
decisions
and
in
its
pleadings
before
courts,
that
once
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate
was
passed,
it
could
not
take
away
rights
granted
under
that
effective
certificate.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
but
--
yes,
but
this
is
not
the
same
situation
as
the
power
of
a
court.
if
you
pose
it
in
terms
of
a
court
in
its
judgment,
i
must
respond
yes
to
what
you
say.
what
we
are
dealing
here
was
statutory
language.
now,
let
me
point
out
as
--
as
mr.
davis
was
very
frank
to
admit,
that
this
is
a
unique
statute
in
that
the
civil
aeronautics
act
is
passed
in
1938
and
the
federal
aviation
act
is
passed
in
1958,
and
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
statutory
language
is
identical.
there
was
no
change
that
affects
this
problem.
it
contained
no
provision
for
reconsideration
or
for
rehearing.
now,
this
is
quite
contrary
to
the
usual
administrative
agency
statute.
for
example,
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
a
statutory
procedure
for
reconsideration
and
rehearing.
the
motor
--
the
water
--
water
carrier
act
and
the
motor
carrier
act
both
have
such
specific
statutory
provisions
for
reconsideration
and
rehearing.
the
civil
aeronautics
act
is
silent.
now,
we
agree
that
the
board
has
it
--
within
its
power
to
establish
by
regulation,
rules
permitting
reconsideration
and
rehearing.
but
our
contention
is
that
those
rules
must
not
contravene
specific
statutory
provisions
which
congress
did
put
in
that
statute.
and
from
the
original
statute
in
1938,
the
language
was
in
there
that
once
the
certificate
effective
date
has
been
reached,
it
can
be
modified
only
as
hereinafter
provided.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
in
the
--
to
--
to
the
full
extent
of
taking
away
any
authority
that
became
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
no.
well,
i
misunderstood
your
question
then.
my
position
is
that
it
has
full
power
to
deal
with
its
original
order
and
change
it
to
add
to
it
or
to
take
away
from
it
up
to
the
date
of
effective
--
effectiveness
of
the
certificate.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
in
the
sense
of
taking
away
anything,
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
--
i
think
that
i
probably
should
say
yes
to
your
question,
but
your
leading
me
into
an
avenue
that
i
have
not
explored.
my
exploration
has
been
directed
to
the
board's
power
to
take
operating
rights
away
from
my
client.
and
so,
i
say
without
qualification,
i
agree
with
you
that
it
loses
its
power
to
take
anything
away
when
the
certificate
becomes
effective.
i
--
i
don't
hesitate
on
that
at
all.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
no.
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i'm
sorry
that
i've
been
confusing.
when
the
board
issues
a
decision
in
one
of
this
new
route
proceedings
and
grants
new
operating
authority,
it
does
not
make
the
certificate.
the
--
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
effective
on
the
very
same
day
its
opinion
comes
up.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
it
always
sets
that
effective
date
out
in
the
future,
so
that
it
will
have
time
to
reconsider
that
order
if
some
legal
or
economic
error
is
presented
to
it.
i
--
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
that
effective
date
set
by
the
board
under
the
language
of
the
statute
is
reached
in
past,
then
it
cannot
deal
with
that
certificate
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
except
under
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
sorry.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
also
would
say
that
if
--
when
you
come
up
to
the
effective
date,
the
board
still
feels
we
have
a
difficult
question
here
and
we're
not
ready
to
allow
this
certificate
to
become
effective
by
simply
issuing
an
order
staying
that
effective
date,
it
retained
100%
control
of
the
situation
and
may
deal
with
it
at
its
own
discretion
and
at
its
own
timing.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
i
say
that
after
the
effective
date,
the
board
may
--
if
it
makes
a
finding
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
may
modify
or
suspend
that
certificate
under
401
(g)
following
notice
and
hearing.
401
(g)
also
contains
certain
different
test
dealing
with
revocation.
and
i
say
after
the
effective
date,
if
the
board
makes
the
findings
required
by
401
(g),
it
may
revoke
completely.
but
i
say
that
once
the
effective
date
has
passed
and
the
carrier
has
gone
out
and
expended
money
if
the
board's
urging
and
started
up
this
services,
then
it
must
be
deal
with
that
certificate
under
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
401
(g).
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir,
the
application
is
filed
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well,
simply
because
the
board
didn't
choose
to
do
it
the
right
way,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well,
the
--
there
may
be
a
matter
of
words
but
it
involves
millions
of
dollars
to
the
carrier
that
actually
have
reliance.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well,
i'll
be
perfectly
frankly
in
the
view
of
my
best
of
my
knowledge.
the
board
has
never
utilized
that
route.
what
it
has
always
done
when
it
wish
more
time
was
to
extend
the
effective
date
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
or
issue
a
partial
stay
and
allow
to
become
effective
to
those
parts
of
the
certificate
which
it
wanted
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well,
let
--
let
me
do
what
i
said
i
would
just
a
moment
ago,
and
i
hope
this
is
responsive.
the
board
has
never
approached
this
thing
in
this
way.
it
has
never
used
the
temporary
certificate
as
a
device
to
solve
this
problem.
but
it
does
have
a
long
and
extended
history
of
how
it
has
handled
it
in
the
past
which
is
consistent
with
what
i
am
arguing
for.
now,
let
me
just
point
this
out.
this
thing
all
began
back
in
1948
when
the
civil
aeronautics
board
had
a
very
similar
case
to
the
one
presented
here.
it
had
put
out
a
certificate
authorizing
new
service
to
be
operated
between
kansas
city
and
memphis.
a
certificate
had
become
fully
effective.
service
was
about
to
be
inaugurated.
just
after
the
certificate
had
become
effective
by
a
few
days,
the
board
issued
an
order
in
which
it
indicated
that
it
was
going
to
consider
taking
that
certificate
away
or
modifying
or
either
withdrawing
it,
giving
it
to
somebody
else
or
modifying
what
had
been
granted.
the
board's
power
to
do
this
was
very
seriously
contested
in
that
case.
we
refer,
at
page
29
of
our
brief
to
the
court,
to
this
case
where
the
board
didn't
rule
squarely
on
the
problem
because
it
reaffirmed
the
original
certificate
and
therefore
mooted
the
legal
issue.
but
as
you'll
see
in
the
quotation
at
the
--
just
above
the
footnote
on
page
29,
the
board
said,
"we
have
grave
out
however
as
to
our
possession
of
such
power."
and
then
turning
over
to
the
top
of
the
next
page,
in
view
of
this
doubt,
the
board
made
this
policy
announcement,
"in
future
cases
of
this
kind,
except
for
national
security
or
other
urgent
considerations
dictate
otherwise,
we
shall
pursue
a
policy
of
making
the
certificate
effective
on
such
date,
as
we'll
permit
reconsideration
without
creating
the
legal
problem
raised
in
the
present
case."
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
will
try
to
deal
that
--
with
that
in
a
minute,
sir,
and
i'm
not
--
i
would
just
like
to
add
one
or
two
more
points
just
to
show
you
how
they
have
consistently
applied
this
same
approach.
now,
they
have
always,
with
the
exception
of
this
case,
and
one
other
which
was
not
contested,
they
have
always
set
that
effective
date
far
enough
out
in
the
future,
so
that
they
could
deal
with
these
petitions
for
reconsiderations
before
the
certificate
became
effective
and
the
carrier
got
out
on
a
limb.
now,
it's
not
only
that
the
board
has
consistently
followed
this
practice
itself,
it
is
so
represented
to
the
federal
courts.
for
example,
in
the
case
known
as
the
southwest
airways
versus
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
which
we
referred
to
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
in
briefing
the
case
to
the
ninth
circuit,
the
board
said
this,
"these
clauses
were
providing
for
a
future
effective
date
for
the
certificate
were
inserted
therein
for
the
stated
purpose
of
giving
the
parties
to
the
proceeding
an
opportunity
to
file
petitions
for
reconsideration
of
the
board
a
supplemental
decision
and
to
ensure
time
for
the
board
to
act
their
own
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate."
continuing,
"the
language
therein
requiring
that
a
certificate
shall
continue
in
effect
until
suspended
or
revoked
as
hereinafter
provided
comes
into
play
only
from
the
date
specified
for
effectiveness
in
the
certificate."
and
the
ninth
circuit
relied
very
heavily
on
this
representation.
and
in
the
next
quotation
on
page
32,
we
see
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
skipping
the
introductory
language,
"the
board
points
to
its
administrative
practice
of
postponing
certificates
of
this
character,
so
that
time
may
be
allowed
for
petition
for
reconsideration
of
apparent
orders."
the
circuit
then
referred
to
the
board's
kansas
city-memphis
case
and
continued
to
say,
"the
board
certainly
has
the
power
to
reconsider
its
orders
and
set
them
aside
and
if
certificate's
not
yet
effective
or
dependent
on
those
orders,
they
will
be
extinguished."
the
situation
is
totally
different
from
that
in
which
a
certificate
has
become
effective.
now,
not
only
in
its
administrative
practice,
not
only
in
its
representations
to
the
federal
courts,
but
also
on
its
own
rules
or
practice,
the
board
has
focused
directly
on
this
point.
let
me
point
out
to
you,
if
i
may,
in
delta's
brief
to
this
court,
the
very
last
page
of
the
brief
appendix
--
page
3
of
the
appendix.
the
board's
rule
of
practice
dealing
with
filing
petitions
for
reconsideration.
the
second
full
sentence
says,
"however,
neither
the
filing
nor
the
granting
of
such
a
petition
shall
operate
as
a
stay
of
such
final
order
unless
specifically
so
ordered
by
the
board."
in
other
words,
in
its
own
rule
of
practice,
the
board
recognized
that
this
petition
for
reconsideration
doesn't
stay
the
effective
date
of
that
certificate
going
out,
unless
it
takes
affirmative
action.
now,
one
other
point
on
this
same
subject,
there
was
a
footnote
in
the
government's
brief
which
referred
to
an
amendment
of
these
rules
governing
reconsideration
and
the
footnote
said
the
rule
was
amended
on
february
14,
1959
in
respects
not
here
relevant.
well,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
that
amendment
in
february
of
1959
is
extremely
irrelevant,
and
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
just
what
the
board
did
in
that
case.
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
board
said
when
it
amended
the
rules.
now,
let
me
tell
you
first
before
i
refer
to
the
language,
what
the
amendment
was.
as
we
have
said
before,
customarily,
the
board
allowed
itself
about
30
days
to
act
on
these
petitions
for
reconsideration.
it
used
to
be
that
they
allowed
30
days
for
filing
of
the
petition
and
10
days
for
answer
and
that
cut
into
their
normal
60-day.
so
in
february
of
1959,
they
amended
this
rule
so
as
to
require
petitions
to
be
filled
in
20
days,
answers
in
10
and
this
increased
their
time
for
action
from
20
days
to
30.
and
they
said
this
--
gave
this
as
their
reason
for
taking
this
action
giving
themselves
longer
time.it
is
the
board's
normal
practice
in
route
proceedings
to
make
certificate
awards
effective
60
days
after
issuance
of
the
final
opinion
and
order.
thus,
under
present
filing
procedures,
they
are
normally
remains
only
a
20-day
period
between
the
completion
of
filings
in
the
date
upon
which
the
certificate
becomes
effective.
it
has
become
increasingly
evident,
particularly
with
the
growing
size
and
complexity
of
the
board's
route
proceedings
that
a
period
of
20
days
is
wholly
inadequate
and
imposes
an
undo
burden
upon
the
board
and
its
staff
when
some
action
by
the
board
is
necessary
or
desirable
before
new
or
amended
certificates
take
effect.
so
i
say,
gentlemen,
that
we
have
a
consistent
administrative
interpretation
of
this
statute
recognizing
the
point
for
which
i
contempt.
that
in
the
face
of
this
administrative
interpretation,
the
statue
has
been
--
been
reenacted
with
identical
language
by
the
congress.
and
i
think
we
have
plenty
of
good
case
brought
to
the
effect
that
this
constitutes
absence
some
peculiar
circumstances
endorsement
of
the
administrative
interpretation.
we
have
the
board's
rules
of
practice
which
are
recognized
since
they
were
originally
passed
back
in
the
late
1930s,
that
they
had
to
take
some
actions
staying
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate
if
they
wanted
to
have
effective
control
of
petitions
for
reconsideration
after
the
effective
date
originally
set
forth
for
the
order.
they
have
told
the
federal
circuit
courts
of
appeal
that
this
is
what
they
do
and
the
court
has
blessed
that
interpretation.
so,
what
the
second
circuit
below
is
doing
was
not
bringing
in
some
novel
interpretation
which
flies
in
the
face
of
the
board's
established
practices.
but
as
said,
gentlemen,
you
have
a
way
of
dealing
with
this
situation
which
gives
you
complete
and
continuing
control.
but
don't
let
that
certificate
become
effective
if
you
want
to
keep
control,
because
when
it
becomes
effective,
you
authorize
the
airline
to
go
out
and
spend
literally,
gentlemen,
millions
of
dollars
in
equipping
itself
in
inaugurating
service.
and
we
are
not
going
to
let
you
sit
on
petitions
for
reconsideration
for
five
or
six
months
after
the
certificate
becomes
effective,
and
you
can
encourage
the
inauguration
of
service
and
then
say
that
you
reserve
some
power
to
take
it
away.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
under
401
(g)
and
then
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
(voice
overlap)
notice
--
notice
from
hearing
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
the
procedure.
the
only
difference
would
have
been
that
we
would
have
been
able
to
come
in
and
make
a
further
factual
showing.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
we
were
not
prevented
because
that
act
--
that
procedure
was
never
followed.you
see,
there
--
we
--
we
all
agree
that
there
was
never
any
action
take
another
401
(g)
here.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
so,
we
never
got
into
the
401
(g)
procedure
in
anyway.
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
no,
i'd
say
it
a
different
way.
i
would
say
that
in
the
face
of
the
board's
established
procedures
of
more
than
a
decade,
in
the
face
of
its
administrative
interpretation,
in
the
face
of
the
re-enactment
of
the
statute,
in
the
light
of
that
administrative
interpretation,
in
the
face
of
the
board's
representations
to
the
federal
court
as
to
how
it
interpreted
this
clause,
in
face
of
the
circuit
court's
approval
of
that
interpretation,
we
had
every
right
to
believe
that
when
the
effective
date
came,
we
had
a
certificate,
and
we
could
invest
our
money.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
now,
may
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
want
to
make
--
you
know,
sometimes
when
you
argue
concerning
just
one
or
two
pairs
of
points,
when
we
think
about
air
transportation
all
over
this
country,
it
sounds
de
minimus,
and
we
wonder
why
are
we
taking
up
the
time
of
this
or
that
body
with
problem
involving
restriction
on
two
or
three
little
pairs
of
points,
up
in
the
great
lakes
area.
well,
now,
let
me
just
point
out
to
you
the
ultimate
logic
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
as
i
told
you
before,
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
which
were
filed
involved
not
just
these
10
pairs
of
points
here
at
issue,
but
they
involved
attempts
to
over
throw
all
of
the
great
lakes
area-florida
routes,
which
had
been
certificated
by
that
same
original
order.
in
other
words,
attempts
were
made
to
take
away
northwest
authority
from
chicago
to
florida
and
delta's
from
detroit
to
florida,
and
capital's
from
pittsburgh
to
florida.
that
the
order
came
out
in
september,
petitions
for
reconsideration
were
filed
30
days
later.
specific
request
for
stay
of
all
of
these
major
important
routes
were
filed
with
the
board,
and
the
board
came
out
with
this
opinion
and
said,
"we
have
looked
it
over,
we
find
no
probable
error,
we
haven't
had
time
yet
to
get
the
opinion
out,
but
we
are
not
going
to
stay
these
things,
and
what's
more,
we
urge
you
to
get
started."
now,
sir,
let
me
just
ask
you
to
consider
yourself
in
the
position
of
airline
management
based
with
language
of
this
type.
i'm
reading
now
from
pages
58
to
59
of
the
record,
which
is
this
order
that
the
board
put
out
in
--
in
the
latter
part
of
november.
because
of
the
detailed
matter
as
raised
in
the
petitions
for
reconsideration,
it
will
not
be
possible
to
finally
dispose
of
them
until
after
november
29th,
the
effective
date.
accordingly,
we
are
acting
on
the
request
for
stay
in
this
opinion
in
order,
an
order
disposing
of
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
in
full
will
be
issued
on
a
later
date.
in
assessing
the
request
for
stay,
we
have,
of
course,
given
consideration
of
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
to
determine
the
likelihood
of
error
in
our
original
decision.
after
reviewing
the
matters
raised
in
such
petitions,
we
conclude
that
except
a
specifically
noted
hereinafter
with
respect
to
eastern
certificate,
the
parties
have
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
of
probable
legal
error
or
abuse
of
discretion
in
our
decision
so
as
to
warrant
for
the
stay
be
granted.
moreover,
in
this
proceeding,
we
have
found
that
new
services
to
florida
are
immediately
required
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
during
the
1958-1959
season.
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
these
services
should
be
put
into
operation
at
the
advent
of
peak
winter
season
in
order
to
give
the
travelling
public
the
full
advantage
thereof.
now,
northwest,
delta,
capital
took
this
at
its
face
value,
relying
on
how
the
board
had
treated
effective
date
in
the
past.
we
went
out
and
we
got
the
equipment
and
the
personnel,
and
we
set-up
the
stations
not
just
to
serve
these
10
pairs
of
points
in
the
great
lakes
area,
but
to
set
up
these
extended
routes
with
multi-million
dollar
equipment
running
from
the
great
lakes
area
to
florida.
now,
my
point,
gentlemen,
is
this,
the
same
order
which
denied
the
petitions
for
reconsideration
with
respect
to
those
major
routes
involving
millions
of
dollars
of
equipment
was
the
same
order
which
took
this
operating
authority
in
these
10
markets
away
from
delta.
now,
the
practical
effect
of
adopting
the
government's
position
is
to
say
that
despite
this
long
administrative
and
judicial
background,
despite
the
boards
having
denied
stay
of
the
effective
date,
despite
the
board
having
said,
"get
out
there
and
get
the
service
in
operation
because
we've
got
to
have
it
for
these
people
this
winter,"
that
five
or
six
months
later,
in
the
same
order
which
took
away
our
authorization
in
these
10
pairs,
they
could
have
said,
"we're
going
to
act
on
those
petitions
for
reconsideration
despite
the
effective
date
of
the
certificate.
and
we're
going
to
withdraw
all
of
three
of
those
florida
authorizations,"
and
then,
where
would
we
have
been?
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
is
--
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well,
i'm
--
i'm
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
no.
no.[laughs]
i
thought
it
was
quite
concrete
at
the
time.
you
see,
what
they
said
was,
"we
recognize,
you
say
that
you
want
to
stay
these
certificates."
but
lake
central
and
the
eastern
airlines
and
all
the
others
who
were
opposing
the
--
this
awards
becoming
final,
we're
not
going
to
state
the
effective
date,
we
want
this
service
to
start.
but
they
did
say
"oh,
but
look
here,
it
looks
to
us
as
though
we
shouldn't
allow
this
eastern
certificate
to
become
effective
because
if
we
do,
maybe
we
won't
be
able
to
change
this
thing
that
we
think,
maybe
we
ought
to
take
a
second
look
at
there."
so
they
stayed
the
eastern
certificate.
it
wasn't
just
a
question
of
putting
on
notice,
it
was
a
question
of
following
the
statutory
language
which
says
that
certificate,
once
it
becomes
effective,
can
only
be
modified
as
provided
in
401
(g).
and
in
eastern's
case,
they
thought
they
recognize
something
they'd
better
deal
with.
so
they
put
that
stay
on
there
and
they
kept
eastern
from
investing
any
money.
but
they've
turned
around
and
said,
"we
won't
stay
the
effective
day
of
yours,
go
on
and
start
the
service
and
do
it
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
--
as
promptly
as
possible."
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
well,
your
honor,
i'll
be
perfectly
frank
with
you.
i
--
i
read
that
language
in
the
light
of
what
i
understood
the
law
to
be
and
what
the
board
--
as
the
board
had
applied
the
law
over
a
long
period
of
years.
and
as
the
federal
court
said,
"approve
the
board's
interpretation."
and
i
said
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
i
said
to
myself,
whatever
that
means,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
can
take
anything
away
from
us
after
the
certificate
effective
date
because
congress
said
they
couldn't.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
yes,
sir.
certainly
under
(g),
they
always
(inaudible).
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
that
--
that's
really
the
--
the
heart
of
my
whole
argument
is
that
when
the
congress
has
set
up
a
specific
statutory
method
for
dealing
with
this
situation,
how
could
we
possibly
let
the
board,
under
a
--
a
rule
of
practice
which
runs
headlong
into
the
statute,
upset
the
congressional
intent?
now,
i've
imposed
unduly
on
your
time,
i
think,
gentlemen,
and
i
--
i
haven't
mentioned
one
thing
that
i
would
just
refer
to
rather
than
argue.
and
that
is
this,
there
is
also
a
--
an
extended
line
of
judicial
precedent
in
other
fields,
in
the
surface
carrier
fields
specifically
where
this
court,
in
such
landmark
cases,
the
seatrain,
for
example,
has
said
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
"you
know,
there's
a
right
way
and
a
wrong
way
of
doing
things,
gentlemen.
and
don't
argue
public
policy
to
us
if
you
don't
like
the
way
the
statute
let's
you
do
it.
if
the
statute
sets
up
a
procedure
for
you
which
you
don't
think
you
can
live
with,
go
to
the
congress,
don't
come
to
this
court."
but
on
the
other
hand,
as
long
as
you
are
going
to
operate
under
that
statute
without
amendment,
you
apply
it
the
way
it's
written
down.
and
in
the
seatrain
case,
you
told
them
that
they
couldn't
come
back
after
the
effective
date,
after
the
certificate
was
in
operation,
unless
they
followed
the
specific
statutory
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
respect
to
notice
and
hearing.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
your
honor,
i
hate
to
endorse
that
sentiment
but
as
a
lawyer
that
would
be
my
reaction
to
it.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
no,
sir,
the
only
thing
that
could
be
done
on
a
petition
for
reconsideration
procedure
is
to
argue
the
evidence
already
in
the
record.
mr.
r.
s.
maurer
and
unless
you
could
make
this
showing
to
the
board
that
the
record
should
be
reopened
because
it
radically
changed
circumstances,
we
could
not
present
any
additional
evidence.
