mr.
albert
f.
grisard
may
it
please
the
court.
i,
of
course,
concur
in
what
has
been
said
by
mr.
davis
on
behalf
of
the
government.
and
my
remarks
here
would
be
rather
briefs
and
more
to
do
with
the
record
in
the
case
rather
than
the
legal
issues.
in
the
delta
brief,
there
are
brief
and
references
to
what
are
termed
opposed
to
decisional
change
of
policies
by
the
board
which,
according
to
delta,
lead
the
board
to
issue
its
order
of
may
9th,
i
believe
it
was,
in
1960
which
imposed
these
restrictions
upon
delta's
award
for
the
benefit
of
lake
central
and
piedmont.
and
before
i
get
in
to
that
i
might
say
in
response
to
the
previous
question
of
mr.
davis
that
lake
central
introduced
evidence
to
show
that
its
traffic
--
its
existing
traffic
between
cincinnati
and
indianapolis
and
between
indianapolis
and
chicago
would
be
subject
to
diversion
by
any
award
made
to
the
trunklines
in
this
great
lakes-southeast
case.
and
lake
central
urged
both
by
testimony
of
its
policy
witness
by
its
briefs
to
the
examiner
and
to
the
board
and
on
oral
argument
to
the
board
that
these
restrictions
which
ultimately
were
placed
upon
these
awards
by
the
board
should
be
placed
there
for
the
protection
of
lake
central.
the
board
in
its
original
decision
placed
restrictions
upon
capital,
which
you
will
find
at
44
of
the
record,
upon
twa,
which
is
shown
at
page
48
of
the
record
and
--
and
upon
united
at
pages
48
and
49
of
the
record
for
the
protection
of
lake
central's
local
services
markets.
one
of
these
restrictions,
the
one
pertaining
to
twa
related
to
the
cincinnati-indianapolis
market
which
is
one
of
the
two
involved
here
now.
lake
central's
petition
for
reconsideration,
which
is
in
the
record
pages
88
to
93,
specifically
called
the
--
these
restrictions
to
the
board's
attention
and
showed
the
board
that
it's
failure
to
some
of
the
restrict
delta's
authority
on
the
other
segments
was
clearly
inadvertent
admission.
the
board
thereafter
took
its
action,
which
is
shown
at
page
81
of
the
record,
and
in
the
opinion
of
lake
central
this
action
by
the
board
in
its
order
at
opinion
of
may
7th
was
entirely
consistent
with
its
previous
policy
as
evidence
by
its
award
of
september
1958.
i
wanted
to
say
something
about
why
lake
central
is
interested
in
restricting
delta
in
the
two
markets
which
are
involved
here.
and
first
of
all,
i
might
say
that
the
board
restricted
delta
in
a
total
of
10
markets,
six
of
whom
or
six
of
which
were
for
the
protection
of
piedmont
and
four
of
which
for
lake
central.
two
of
the
lake
central
markets
so
protected
were
prospective
markets.
and
in
a
later
decision
issued
in
august
of
1960,
the
board
denied
lake
central's
applications
for
those
two
markets.
so
we're
not
concern
with
the
restrictions
there.
the
other
two
markets
are
cincinnati-chica
--
cincinnati-indianapolis,
indianapolis-chicago.
in
1958,
before
delta
inaugurated
direct
service
between
chicago
and
indianapolis,
it
carried
a
total
of
143
passengers,
both
local
and
connecting
passengers.
in
1959,
after
it
had
inaugurated
a
direct
service
which
originated
or
terminated,
in
other
words,
at
a
point
as
nearby
as
evansville,
it
carried
a
total
of
6220
passengers.
you
can
see
what
difference
the
lifting
of
this
restriction
or
the
impositions
of
this
restriction
would
make
upon
the
traffic
which
lake
central
would
have
available
to
it.
in
the
cincinnati-indianapolis
market,
in
1958,
delta
carried
26
passengers.in
1959,
it
carried
430.
i
believe
that
mr.
davis
has
touched
briefly
upon
this
question
of
the
board
reserving
the
right
to
make
modifications.
this
was
a
subject
of
comment
by
delta
in
its
briefs
at
page
2,
footnote
3
and
at
pages
16
and
17.
it
is
lake
central's
contention
that
the
language
of
the
board
which
was
stated
at
pages
79
and
80
of
the
record,
definitely
put
delta
on
notice
that
the
board
might,
upon
reconsideration,
make
some
modifications
in
the
certificate
which
it
had
granted
delta.
the
board's
language
is
rather
specifically
filled.
it
says,
"nothing
in
the
present
order
forecloses
the
board
from
full
and
complete
consideration
of
the
pending
petitions
for
reconsideration
on
their
merits."
mr.
albert
f.
grisard
it
has
the
power
to
issue
a
temporary
certificate
as
it
--
mr.
albert
f.
grisard
yes.
mr.
albert
f.
grisard
within
the
language
of
the
act,
yes.
i
have
nothing
further
to
add
at
this
time.
