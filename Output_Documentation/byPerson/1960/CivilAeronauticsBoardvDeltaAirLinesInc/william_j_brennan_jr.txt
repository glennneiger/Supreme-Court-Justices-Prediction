justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask?
what
--
what
has
been
the
congressional
factor
ordinarily,
explicitly
to
authorize
motions
for
reconsideration
as
to
other
regulatory
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have
any
--
any
light
on
why
that
was
not
from
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
proceeding
begins
before
it
was
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
precedes
the
1958
provision,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
maurer,
i
think
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
took
the
position
in
your
brief,
did
you
not,
that
--
on
filling
a
petition
for
reconsideration
here,
the
board
might
have
extended
that
60-day
period
to
some
longer
period?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
that
have
been,
mr.
maurer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
reason
mr.
davis
suggested,
namely,
that
they
were
anxious
to
have
these
orders
effective
because
of
the
winter
traffic
to
miami?

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
maurer,
this
--
this
is
a
--
i
think
you
told
us
earlier
that
before
the
original
certificate
was
issued,
lake
central
had
sought
restrictions,
evidence
had
been
taken
in
respect
to
that
request
and
the
original
certificate
issued
denied
that
request.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
there
was
a
petition
for
reconsideration.
i
would
suppose
you
understood
that
to
be
a
reconsideration
of
the
denial
of
those
restrictions
based
on
that
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
--
so
at
that
juncture,
at
least
you
knew
that
what
lake
central
was
looking
for
was
reconsideration
of
denial
and
restrictions,
at
the
end,
have
actually
having
the
--
the
restrictions
imposed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
then
came
this
order
which
told
you,
"well,
we'll
deny
the
stay,
but
you
understand
that
the
denial
does
not
mean
we've
yet
decided
whether
those
restrictions
will
be
imposed."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
urge
of
considerations
here
where
the
desire
to
have
a
miami
service
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
made
--
more
urgent
you
suggest
because
they
didn't
think
we
--
was
much
in
the
way
of
merit
to
the
petitions
for
reconsideration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
what
bearing
it
has
on
the
urgency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
talking
about
--
well,
when
they
say
they
didn't
--
suppose
there
was
error,
that
went,
i
gather
to
all
the
petitions
for
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
for
reconsideration.
those
would
start
with
these
10
points
plus
the
major
ones
which
were
the
trunk
services
to
