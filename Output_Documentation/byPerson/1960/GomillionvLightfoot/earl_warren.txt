chief
justice
earl

mr.
gray,
how
--
how
about
the
municipal
services
of
this
people
we're
getting
beforehand,
are
they
deprived
of
all
of
those
services
now,
let
us
say
fire
service,
things
of
that
kind?
are
they
beyond
the
fire
services
of
the
city
of
tuskegee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
they
patrol
at
all
the
city
of
tuskegee,
do
they
patrol
the
--
the
district
that's
been
cut
off
from?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
this
scale?
chief
justice
earl
warren
800
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
400--
400
feet
to
the
inch
then,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
20
inches
then
would
be
my
own
(inaudible),
yes
about
8000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter,
what
--
what
is
the
procedure
in
your
state
for
changing
the
boundaries
of
the
city?
how
--
how
was
this
accomplished?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
normal
way
that
the
boundaries
of
the
city
are
changed
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words
in
your
state,
the
legislature
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
pictures
the
boundary
lines
of
all
cities
and
the
--
and
the
voters
have
nothing
to
do
with
determining
what
the
limits
of
the
city
will
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

c.

gomillion
et

petitioners,
versus
phil
m.
lightfoot,
as
mayor
of
the
city
of
tuskegee.
mr.
carter,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter,
suppose
there
were
--
there
were
no
voters
at
all
registered
in
the
old
city,
that
is
no
negro
voters,
and
they
had
accomplished
this
same
result.
would
you
be
in
any
different
positions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elman
may
i
ask,
does
the
city
have
responsibility
for
those
services
as
well
as
jurisdiction
to
render
them
if
it
desires
to
do
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
outside
of
the
city?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
the
city
levy
any
tax
on
those
people
out
there
for
services?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carter.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
carter,
you
said
that
the
motive
cannot
be
judicially
inquired
into.
can
the
results
of
the
statute
be
inquired
into
judicially?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
not
ultimate
purpose
but
ultimate
results.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
a
--
is
it
a
judicial
--
a
proper
judicial
inquiry?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
suppose
it's
incompatible
result
that
it
achieves,
is
incompatible
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
motive.
i'm
talking
about
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
statute
on
the
people
who
live
in
that
--
in
that
city.
suppose
--
suppose
that
they
access
nothing
with
discriminatory
nature
but
in
effect,
it
does
substantially
affect
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
people
who
--
who
live
there.
is
there
no
judicial
inquiry
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
say
you
have
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
talking
about
absolutes.
all
i'm
trying
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
ask
you
is
if
it's
a
--
a
proper
subject
matter
for
judicial
inquiry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
that
all
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
all
they're
asking
for
here
to
have
--
to
have
an
inquiry
made
by
the
court
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
are
not
asking
us
to
decide
anything
here.

justice

mr.
carter.
