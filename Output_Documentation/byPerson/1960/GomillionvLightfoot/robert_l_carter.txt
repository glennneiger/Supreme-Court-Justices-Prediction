mr.
robert
l.
carter
our
position
in
this
case
is
quite
simple.
we
take
the
position
that
that
this
is
purely
a
case
of
racial
discrimination,
solely
and
simply
racial
discrimination
that
the
natural
result
of
the
passage
of
act
140
was
to
put
out
of
the
city
limit
that
--
indicated
in
this
map,
all
the
areas
of
concentrated
negro
residents
without
affecting
any
white
persons
and
without
affecting
any
of
these
white
qualified
voters.
now,
the
--
as
you
can
see
on
--
on
here,
that
what
the
map
does,
what
the
--
what
the
new
--
the
change
is
due
is
to
weave
in
and
--
in
and
around
the
negro
residents
in
order
to
exclude
as
many
of
them
as
possibly
can.
now,
as
mr.
gray
has
pointed
out,
there
has
been
no
statement
in
the
--
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
other
than
the
fact
that
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
was
discriminatory.
now,
it's
our
position
that
as
a
result
of
the
enactment
of
act
140
that
the
petitioners
and
other
negroes
similarly
situated
have
been
deprived
the
personal
and
private
constitutional
rights
protected
under
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
they
have
been
--
did
--
did
not
--
denied
the
right
of
municipal
residence
in
the
city
and
the
benefits
which
are
incident
thereto
and
that
they
have
to
deny
the
right
to
vote
in
the
municipal
elections
and
we
contend
that
they
are
to
deny
these
rights
solely
because
they
are
negroes
and
for
no
other
reason.
now,
as
the
city
has
been
redrawn,
tuskegee
has
become
virtually
a
white
city
with
negroes
denied
the
right
to
vote
in
the
city
and
the
right
to
live
in
the
city.
now,
we
take
the
position,
if
the
court
please,
that
it
is
quite
obvious
that
alabama
could
not
pass
the
statute
which
would
openly
disenfranchise
negroes
which
would
open
the
set
of
test
for
their
right
to
vote
in
any
election
in
any
territory
unit
which
was
different
from
those
applying
to
other
persons.
and
if
such
a
law
were
before
the
court,
there
would
be
no
question
but
that,
this
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible.
and
that
if
such
a
claim
were
made
that
this
would
be
cognizable
in
the
federal
court
and
that
there
would
be
--
redress
would
be
available.
we
also
contend
that
if
alabama
had
passed
the
statute,
which
denied
negroes
the
right
to
live
in
tuskegee
or
to
any
of
the
benefits
which
accrue
to
the
citizens
of
tuskegee,
that
this
would
be
a
denial
of
fourteenth
amendment
rights
and
that
there
would
be
no
question
that
this
kind
of
claim
would
have
--
would
be
available
for
redress
in
the
federal
court.
we
further
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
on
the
basis
of
its
decision
that
it
would
not
matter
whether
this
was
done
openly
or
covertly.
the
fact
that
it
was
done
and
this
was
the
result,
there
would
be
a
claim
of
constitutional
deprivation
which
would
be
actionable
before
the
federal
judiciary.
now,
our
contention
is
that
this
is
our
case,
that
our
case
is
--
is
the
same
case
as
the
cases
which
apply
to
the
--
these
kinds
of
discrimination
--
discriminations
and
disenfranchising.
we
feel
that
this
passage
of
act
140
is
--
has
brought
the
case
of
racial
discrimination
as
any
case
that
has
come
before
this
court
between
yick
wo
versus
hopkins
and
cooper
versus
aaron.
we
also
contend
that
the
--
the
--
our
allegations,
the
allegations
of
undisputed
--
which
are
undisputed
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
which
the
court
cited
in
its
memorandum
opinion
in
the
district
court,
that
these
allegations
of
rank
discrimination
cannot
be
cast
aside
or
discounted
by
placing
labels
upon
them.
the
labeling
action
one
way
or
the
other
is
--
so
far
as
the
state
--
problem
is
concerned.
we
think
that
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
defendants
rely
upon
the
cases
like
mount
pleasant
versus
beckwith,
which
involves
the
plenary
power
of
a
--
of
a
state
to
redefine
its
borders
or
colegrove
--
colegrove
versus
green
are
not
cases
which
apply
to
this
--
to
this
situation.
we
think
that
we
--
that
our
situation
is
--
is
based
upon
federal
constitutional
doctrine
that
the
state
cannot
discriminate
against
persons
because
of
race
or
color.
they
can't
discriminate
against
them
in
terms
of
the
--
of
the
benefits
that
are
--
are
applicable
in
terms
of
residence.
they
can't
discriminate
against
them
in
terms
of
their
right
to
participate
in
elections.
and
that
where
such
claims
are
made
that
we
have
a
--
a
prima
facie
case
which
the
federal
courts
can
hear.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
and
our
problem
is
that
in
--
in
the
kinds
of
case
that
we
have
alleged,
that
it
is
the
kind
of
case
in
which
normally,
we
have
been
permitted
in
the
--
and
of
the
history
of
the
--
of
the
kinds
of
racial
discrimination
cases
which
occur
that
there's
been
no
question
but
this
type
of
case
is
--
can
go
to
court
and
that
we
have
a
right
to
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
now,
this
--
we
--
we
think
is
--
is
our
position.
and
that
we
don't
believe
that
we
need
to
involve
ourselves
of
--
in
any
argument
as
to
whether
alabama
has
the
right
to
redraw
its
boundary
lines
or
whether
we
--
we,
petitioners,
have
any
vested
right
to
participate
in
the
electoral
process
of
any
territory
unit
of
alabama
or
whether
the
petitioners
have
any
vested
rights
to
live
in
any
territory
unit.
we
do
--
we
contend
that
alabama
may
redraft
its
territorial
limits
but
it
cannot
do
it
in
order
to
accomplish
a
racially
proscribed
discrimination
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
that
the
petitioners
do
have
a
vested
right
to
reside
in
any
territorial
limit
--
unit
in
--
in
alabama
and
to
participate
in
the
election
process
that
they
have
a
vested
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
the
right
to
live
in
that
unit
or
to
participate
in
it
because
they
are
negroes.
this
we
think
is
the
contentions
and
--
the
contentions
which
we
make
here
and
this
is
the
kind
of
case
which
we
think
this
presents.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
is
absolutely
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
they
--
they
have
the
right
to
participate
in
all
other
elections
other
than
elections
that
are
involved
only
to
limit
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
tuskegee.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
same
registration
board
that
the
macon
county
met
registration
board
which
was
--
which
had
been
made
a
part
of
the
--
the
report
of
the
united
states
commission
on
civil
rights.
it's
the
same
board
that
registers
people
in
tuskegee
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
is
--
this
--
it
makes
no
difference
in
this
regard.
our
--
our
contention
is
that
because
these
persons
who
were
negroes
are
not
permitted
to
vote
in
the
municipal
elections,
that
they
have
been
deprived
because
of
color
of
a
right
of
value
and
because
they
are
negroes,
because
they
can
no
longer
live
in
the
city
of
tuskegee
that
they
have
been
denied
rights
protected
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
don't
contend
that
--
that
they
have
been,
in
any
way,
placed
in
any
different
position
in
other
respects.
but
in
our
judgment,
this
is
a
--
a
serious
constitutional
claim
which
--
which
we
think,
in
other
circumstances,
we
are
entitled
to
hear
as
to
have
a
hearing
if
approved
and
if
we
can
prove
our
case,
we
think
we're
entitled
to
the
relief
which
has
been
asked
by
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
was
accomplished
by
a
--
an
act.
this
is
called
the
private
bill
which
was
sponsored
by
the
senate
of
--
from
this
county.
now,
this
was
submitted
by
--
to
the
legislature
as
the
bill
of
senator
(inaudible)
which
was
the
first
in
our
petition
in
our
brief.
this
bill
was
passed
by
the
state
legislature,
a
statute
affecting
only
the
contours
of
tuskegee.
now,
this
is
the
way
which
it
--
it's
--
this
is
the
way
which
it
is
done
as
far
as
i
had
been
able
to
gather.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
this
is
the
normal
way
that
i
understand
it
has
changed.
there
might
be
a
petition
on
the
residents
to
the
legislature
to
change
the
boundaries
but
in
--
in
most
regard,
there
was
nothing
unusual
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
gather
about
the
fact
that
this
bill
was
passed.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
this
is
my
--
that's
my
understanding,
exactly,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
i
have
been
advised
by
--
by
mr.
gray
that
there
is
a
procedure
in
which
they
can
do
it
too.
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
there
is
a
procedure
but
whereby
the
voters
may
participate.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
initiated
by
some
kind
of
--
by
a
referendum.
but
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
based
upon
alabama
law
in
terms
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
in
--
in
terms
of
procedural
requirements
to
make
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
the
act
valid.
we
raise
no
issue
about
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
that
at
all.
our
issue
is
that
we
raise
and
that
it
is
invalid
under
the
constitution
as
a
substantive
of
merit.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
because
of
its
effect,
because
the
result
of
the
statute
is,
as
we
have
indicated
and
that
--
as
we
indicate
that
the
statute
--
we
don't
--
we
--
mr.
justice
black,
we
don't
even
believe
that
we
have
to,
at
this
time,
go
into
purpose
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
result
of
this
--
this
warrant
as
we
have
shown
is
to
accomplish
what
we've
alleged
has
been
accomplished
and
that
is
to
put
negroes
outside
the
limits
and
all
the
electors
and
place
white
people
in,
indolence
so
that
the
--
the
purpose
and
effect
of
the
statute
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
is
--
is
this
and
for
that
reason,
we
take
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
proof
that
we
would
offer
would
be
to
show
that
we
have
the
city,
which
has
never
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
the
proof
we
would
offer
is
that
this
territory
which
has
four
sides
but
now,
the
recast
is
this
--
what
i
consider
an
extraordinary
discernible.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sea
dragon.
that
--
as
a
result
of
this,
that
all
negroes
have
been
cast
outside
of
the
city,
some
close
to
5000
negroes
and
1000
white
persons
being
left
here.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
yes,
we
would
think
that
there
would
because
we
would
be
at
a
point
of
proof.
we
would
have
to
prove
our
case.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
purpose
and
effect
because
insofar
as
--
we
--
we
think
that
we
can
show
that
the
line
was
drawn
--
where
a
line
drawn
to
a
two
or
three
places
as
the
white
people
on
one
side
and
negroes
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
and
that
here
in
other
places
where
the
line
comes
weaved
around
it,
it
weaved
in
around
the
negro
neighborhood.
now,
we
believe
that
if
we
can
demonstrate
that
as
a
result
of
this,
that
all
of
the
negroes
are
placed
out
of
the
line
comes
that
we
are
in
a
good
position
to
show
discrimination
as
we
would
be
able
to
show
in
a
jury
explanation
cases
and
this
would
be
the
kind
of
proof
that
we
have.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
i
may
recapitulate
briefly
from
where
we
were
when
the
argument
broke
off
yesterday.
it's
our
contention
that
act
140,
the
statute
herein
question
by
redefining
the
boundaries
of
tuskegee
in
the
bizarre
fashion
indicated
from
the
back
from
--
in
the
chart
on
the
back
that
has
--
has
accomplished
a
purposeful
and
intentional
discrimination
against
negroes
as
a
class.
the
act
has
cast
outside
of
the
city,
all
of
the
qualified
negro
voters
with
--
with
the
exception
of
four
or
five
and
has
reduced
tuskegee
from
a
city
of
approximately
7000
persons
of
whom
about
five
--
in
excess
of
5000
more
negroes
and
1300
white
to
a
population
of
approximately
1310
white
persons
and
at
best,
a
few
hundred
negroes.
the
negroes,
who
are
left
in
the
city,
are
left
in
the
city
only
because
of
the
fact
that
they
could
not
have
been
cast
out
of
the
city
without
affecting
white
persons.
now,
it's
our
contention
that
this
is
a
purposeful
and
intentional
discrimination
and
that
this
case
is
governed
by
the
discrimination
cases
and
that
the
rule
of
law
applicable
to
--
to
them
controls
here
that
the
allegations
which
we
have
made
--
make
out
of
case
which
is
justiciable
and
actionable
in
the
court
and
that
we
are
entitled
to
a
hearing
in
the
court
below.
now,
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
no
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
don't
know,
if
the
court
please.
we
know
that
they
--
and
we
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
only
four
or
five
qualified
electors
or
qualified
voters
were
left.
but
we
do
not,
as
mr.
gray
indicated
yesterday,
have
the
exact
census
figures
to
be
able
to
tell
the
court
with
exactitude
how
many
negroes
were
left
in
the
city.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
they
are
not
clustered
on
the
map.
they
are
--
they
live
in
--
in
some
parts
of
this
various
area
here.
now,
our
contention
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
what
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
--
what
i
mean
is
that
some
of
them
are
living
on
this
side
of
the
(inaudible)
and
they
live
with
--
within
the
confines
of
this.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
not
in
the
center
of
the
city.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
reduced
it
only
half
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
it
has
done
now
and
therefore
left
more
negroes
in
--
inside
--inside
than
are
now?
mr.
robert
l.
carter
is
that
question?
well,
i
think,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
i
would
have
a
more
difficult
question
in
terms
of
showing
that
there
was
discrimination.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
proof,
proof.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
proof
of
the
purpose.
but
i
also
have,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
the
natural
consequences
that
we
think
we
can
show
the
fact
that
this
cannot
be
disputed
but
the
facts
of
the
matter
are
that
all
of
these
negro
neighborhoods
had
been
cast
out
of
the
city.
this
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
do.
i
think
that
that
would
violate
the
constitution
because
i
think
that
the
boundary
line
would
be
--
would
be
drawn
on
the
basis
of
race
and
i
think
that
this
is
violative
of
the
constitutional
--
of
prosecution.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
the
only
way
i
would
get
to
that
would
be
to
show
that
that
was
the
purpose
but
i
can
also
get
to
it
to
show
that
that
was
the
effect.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
if
--
if
i
can
show
that
in
terms
of
the
facts
that
i
would
be
able
to
show
discrimination
because
i
believe
that
--
that
if
the
--
if
the
effect,
if
the
question
of
proof
is
the
effect,
this
is
an
incidental
effect,
this
is
something
else.
but
in
this,
where
this
question
we
have
before
the
court,
with
the
way
these
lines
are
growing
as
they
live
in
and
out
of
the
--
in
and
out
of
the
city
then
the
natural
effect,
this
cannot
be
an
incident
of
where
there's
occurring,
this
is
--
this
has
to
be
the
natural
consequences
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
that
is
enough,
i
think,
for
us
to
go
to
court
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
don't
believe,
if
the
court
please,
we
don't
think
that
the
colegrove
doctrine
has
anything
to
do
with
this
problem
because
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
do
not.
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
we
--
we
think
that
this
has
no
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
if
--
if
the
only
way
we
can
reach
--
if
the
only
--
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
only
way
they
can
reach
our
problem
is
to
overrule
colegrove
versus
green,
we
would
have
to
take
that
position.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
we
are
--
but
that
--
at
the
present
time
that
we
are
in
that
position
to
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right,
sir.
we're
not
asking
to
--
to
overrule
colegrove
versus
green.
our
contention
is
that
this
is
not
a
reapportionment
case
and
that
the
colegrove
doctrine
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
problems
which
are
raised
here.
we
take
the
position
that
this
is
purely
a
race
discrimination
case
and
that
it
is
not
involved
in
the
colegrove
versus
green
problem
at
all.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
as
i
said
to
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
can
adopt
to
policy
of
--
which
would
have
--
would
amount
to
divide
the
county
or
any
territorial
unit
in
order
to
generalize
it
in
terms
of
white
and
negro.
i
think
that
this
is
forbidden
by
the
county
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
forbidden
--
i
think
this
is
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
your
instance,
it
would
be
--
it
seem
to
me
would
be
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
wouldn't
have
the
fifteenth
amendment
but
i
think
it
would
be
forbidden
by
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
that
--
that
is
--
is
a
more
difficult
question
but
the
problem
i
have
--
i
would
think
that
that
--
that
that
case
in
that
particular
kind
of
case
that
i
would
be
--
that
you
would
be
able
to
show
that
this
was
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
but
at
the
same
time,
it
seems
to
me,
if
the
court
please,
there
would
--
there
might
be
differences
in
terms
of
this,
in
terms
of
whether
this
is
an
equal
protection
argument.
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
that
problem
when
--
when
race
is
involved
because
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
because
of
its
clear
provisions
in
respect
to
what
this
court
has
had.
so
that
where
race
is
involved,
our
contention
is
in
this,
the
race
discrimination
case,
we
have
a
clear
protection
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
would
forbid
the
state
from
doing
exactly
what
--
what
you
suggest
is
my
opinion.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
about
--
we
--
we
say
in
our
brief,
we
--
we
--
approximately
three
or
four.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
so
that
in
this
case,
we
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
throws
them
out
of
the
right
to
vote
in
--
in
the
municipality
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that
is
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
plus
the
fact
that
they
--
they
do
not
have
the
right
to
participate
in
the
rules
--
in
making
the
rules,
regulations
which
would
govern
them
in
terms
to
the
kinds
of
protection
that
they
would
have.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
they
have
a
--
they
have
a
county
governor.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
agree
with
that,
yes
sir
and
this
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
--
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
so
and
this
is
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
think
that
the
400
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes
sir,
but
i
think
that
the
--
in
terms
of
this
case
if
your
honor
pleases.
the
fact
that
400,
that
397
or
396
of
400
were
cast
out,
it
seems
to
--
it
seems
to
me
to
--
to
lessen
the
burden
that
we
have
in
terms
of
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
and
this
is
--
well,
this
is
why
in
our
judgment
since
we
had
396
persons
that
we
feel
that
we
have
no
problem
of
--
of
showing
that
this
--
this
act
that
we
get
to
deprive
or
unable
to
go
to
prove,
we
think
that
we
had
no
--
no
problem
of
showing
that
this
act
is
unconstitutional
because
we
feel
that
we
have
overwhelming
evidence
to
demonstrate
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i
couldn't
--
at
that
point,
what
we
would
have
to
--
to
show
--
well,
i
think
that
we
would
have
a
fifteenth
amendment
argument
because
they
would
not
be
entitled
with
the
vote
in
the
--
in
the
old
city
and
we
would
have
an
equal
protection
and
due
process
argument
as
well
in
this
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
line
was
drawn
as
we
suggest
on
the
basis
of
race.
i
don't
think
that
would
change
our
position.
it
would,
as
mr.
justice
black
suggests,
change
the
nature
of
the
evidence
that
we
would
have
to
--
to
bring
on
to
prove
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
act.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
now
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i'm
sure
--
we're
sure
that
there
are
as
i
--
the
terms
that
indicate
a
little
earlier.
we
really
--
we
don't
know.
we
attempted
to
get
the
exact
figures
as
to
how
many
negroes
were
in
the
city
at
the
present
time
but
census
figures
are
not
available
and
will
not
be
available
until
december.
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint
and
this
has
been
--
has
been
taken
as
truth
and
only
three
or
four
qualified
voters
are
left
in
the
city.
now,
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
there
maybe.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right
sir.
who
--
who
were
not
able
to
be
cast
out
by
the
--
by
--
in
terms
of
these
lines
without
taking
quite
persons
outside
too.
this
is
our
contention
that
the
only
negroes
left
in
were
those
who
left
in,
that
the
state
could
not
put
up
without
affecting
white
persons
as
well.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no,
sir.
no
white
person
who
lived
in
the
city
has
been
in
any
way
voter
or
not
voter
affected
by
this
--
this
change
environment.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
about
five,
yeah,
five
to
--
about
five
to
one.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that
justice
stewart
because
as
you
note
where
the
negroes
live
or
where
the
--
as
the
city
is
withdrawn.
the
residents
of
white
persons
are
those
that
are
around
the
center,
clustered
around
the
center
of
the
city.
the
negro
neighborhoods
are
on
the
periphery
--
on
the
periphery
of
the
city
so
that
the
reduction
in
this
way,
as
they
had
done
it
this
way,
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
there's
going
to
be
a
five
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
now,
that
this
would--
in
that
kind
of
case
but
this
of
course
is
not
our
case
because
you
--
in
that
kind
of
case,
you
would
have
a
reduction
of
white
instead
of
negroes
with
the
case
that
you
suggest.
in
our
case,
we
have
a
reduction
only
of
negroes
and
not
reduction
in
terms
of
the
population
parties.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
no
sir.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
oh,
that's
true.
that's
true.
the
city
that
--
the
city
as
has
been
withdraw
--
withdrawn
as
we've
attempted
to
indicate
yesterday
is
virtually
a
white
city,
it
is
overwhelmingly
white
with
--
we
think
no
more
than
about
200
negroes.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
yes.
we
--
we
thought
that
this
is
a
guest
because
we
don't
know.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
that's
right.
now
if
i
may
close,
i
wanted
to
indicate
to
the
court
our
position
that
this
is
--
this
being
as
we
contend
a
--
a
race
discrimination
case.
that
we
think
that
there
are
no
problems
of
the
least
involved
here
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
case
in
which
there
would
be
any
question
of
un
--
any
unusual
problems
in
terms
of
relief
as
we
request.
we
request
that
the
declaratory
judgment
which
were
in
that
matter
which
would
hold
that
this
--
that
this
statute
violates
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clause
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
proscriptions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
as
well.
we
also
request
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
and
an
injunction
to
restrain
state
officials
from
keeping
the
--
the
petitioners
and
other
negroes
from
voting
in
the
municipal
elections
in
tuskegee.
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
we
think
that
is
the
same
kind
of
relief
which
this
court
has
normally
granted
in
cases
of
this
kind
and
that
therefore
it
offers
no
peculiar
difficult
problems
of
equitable
relief.
for
this
reason,
if
the
court
please,
we
think
that
we
have
presented
a
case
which
comes
within
the
race
discrimination
cases
and
that
we
have
presented
a
case
which
requires
under
the
rules
and
the
doctrine
of
about
--
of
constitutional
doctrine
which
has
been
announced
by
this
court
that
the
state
cannot
discriminate
against
persons
because
of
their
because
of
their
race
and
color.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well
it
would
destroy
--
mr.
robert
l.
carter
it
would
destroy
and
the
city
would
revert.
it
would
revert
to
where
it
was.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
well,
we
may
not
need
this
--
the
kind
of
--
the
kind
of
relief
but
we
want
--
we're
asking
for
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
terms
of
--
of
the
petitioner's
participating
in
the
electoral
process.
mr.
robert
l.
carter
i
just
have
one
word
and
i
just
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
what
we
--
again,
what
we
think
the
propositions
are
before
us.
what
we
are
--
we
have
alleged,
made
allegations
that
act
140
accomplishes
disenfranchising
based
upon
race
and
a
denial
of
residence
because
of
race.
it
is
our
opposition,
if
the
court
please,
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
that
both
claims
heard
in
the
court.
the
abatement
of
racial
discrimination
has
always
been
the
business
of
--
of
the
--
of
the
courts
and
particularly,
the
federal
court
certainly
since
the
civil
war.
the
fact
that
this
was
done
by
virtually
of
boundary
lines
and
so
forth
we
think
makes
no
difference
that
the
question
we
think
that
we're
entitled
to
is
to
go
into
a
court,
to
have
a
hearing
and
to
put
--
and
to
submit
proof
that
racial
discrimination,
which
we
alleged
had
been
accomplished
and
as
such,
we
think
that
this
is
--
this
is
our
case
and
that
this
case
is
governed
as
we
said
before
by
the
race
discrimination
cases,
where
this
thing
has
been
aligned.
thank
you.
