justice
william
o.
douglas
would
it
be
opened
to
the
city
to
call
the
trial,
the
court
back
for
trial
to
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
would
it
be
open
to
the
city
under
your
theory
to
show
that
there
was
another
reason
for
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
purpose
becomes
the
central
aim
of
the
--
of
the
litigation
of
the
said
court,
controversial
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
--
supposed
that
we
reaching
this
argument,
it's
pretty
far
historically.
the
school
districts
had
been
drawn
with
the
view
of
a
--
these
set
of
school
system.
your
argument
doesn't
permit
a
(inaudible)
challenge
those
and
have
them
redrawn
by
different
standards.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
argument
might
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
would
--
would
allow
redrawing
of
some
municipal
lines
perhaps.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
understand
that.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
--
drawing
of
lines
by
somebody.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
misunderstood
my
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
my
question
wasn't
--
you
misunderstood
my
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
this
was
a
class
--
a
historic
pattern
of
the
city
of
tuskegee
and
those
who
were
out
were
trying
to
get
in.
what
would
you
say
to
that?
that's
comparable
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
to
the
school
district
case
that
you
wrote.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
those
are
existing
facts
in
many
communities.
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
every
municipal
line
was
withdrawn
by
some
state
authority
i
suppose.
