that's
general
true
to
the
state,
doesn't
it?
justice

l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
it
effect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
proof
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
reduced
it
on
a
half
that
much,
would
you
see
any
difference?
justice

black
reduced
the
size
of
the
city
on
a
half
that
much.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice

l.
black
you
mean
proof
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
you
finally
get
back
to
proof
of
the
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose,
they
would
split
up,
would
decide
to
split
up
a
county
whether
that
way.
would
you
say
it
is
dividing
up
the
county
in
two
parts,
if
it
could
be
shown
they
did
it
because
they
wanted
to
get
the
colored
people
in
one
county
and
the
white
people
on
another
that
that
would
violate
the
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
you
should
get
to
that,
of
course,
would
be
to
show
that
was
the
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
that
is
the
effect
to
the
state,
divides
up
two
counties.
one
county
and
then
two
or
three,
and
that
the
effect
of
it
is
to
live
predominant,
live
one
of
the
counties
predominant
to
white,
the
other
predominant
to
colors.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
your
--
what
argument
gets
down
to
is
this,
isn't
it?
that
whether
it
is
shown
by
the
facts
of
the
way
that
counties
divided
a
city
is
to
the
--
that
it
leaves
one
part
of
it
predominant
to
white
which
had
been
predominant
to
color.
that
is
enough
to
deprive
the
state,
invalid
to
create
--
to
the
take
that
part
of
land
out
of
the
municipality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
the
state
doesn't
have
a
right
to
adopt
that
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
gets
down
to
a
purpose
of
the
policy.
what
do
you
do
with
colegrove
and
green
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ask
us
to
overrule
colegrove
and
green?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
asked
us
not
to
reconsider
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
one
--
suppose
one
was
at
the
opinion,
it
should
have
to
reconsider
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
that
that
be
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you're
not
asking
us
to.
am
i
to
understand
that
you're
not
asking
us
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
said
it
throws
them
out
of
the
right
to
vote?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
area
that
they
have
--
that
has
been
changed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
have
a
county
governor,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
position
i
think
it's
better
to
place
it
squarely
on
the
fact
as
they
actually
are,
from
(inaudible)
your
position
seems
to
me
that
the
unit,
when
a
state
decide
in
the
exercise
of
its
policy
or
polity,
if
you
wish
to
call
it
polity,
at
least
the
government
(inaudible)
if
you
wish
to
call
it
policy
or
policies,
has
the
policy
wants
to
change
a
municipality,
make
it
smaller,
cut
off
the
lives
part
of
it,
that
it
does
not
take
away
the
life
of
the
people
that
have
taken
out
of
that
municipality
to
vote.
they
are
left
with
the
--
such
right
to
vote
as
those
in
the
county
outside
of
the
municipality
here.
i
presumed
what
you
have
to
mean
is
in
this.
although
the
state
has
arrived
to
change
the
area,
about
the
city,
that
have
to
look
at
its
purpose
that
you
are
arguing,
to
see
and
to
define
that
the
perpetua
to
put
colored
people
out
of
that
area
so
that
they
could
not
vote
in
that
area
although
they
could
vote
outside
of
that
area,
that
that
violates
the
equal
protection
in
our
view,
whichever
authorities
it
does.
i
agree,
that's
the
real
fact,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
if
they
have
unconstitutionally
deprived
these
people
with
the
right
to
vote
whether
it
was
400,
3000
or
six.
if
the
purpose
is
to
do
this
and
the
purpose
can
validates
it
as
a
discrimination,
why
are
not
six
entitled
to
protection
the
same
as
425
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
3000?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
then
we've
held
that
with
reference
to
one
man
who's
deprived,
that
was
jury
found.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
showing
the
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
using
it
as
an
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
show
the
purpose.
you
finally
get
back
to
whether
or
not
it
violates
the
constitution
for
a
state
to
reduce
the
area
of
a
city
for
the
purpose
of
taking
colored
voters
out
of
that
city,
throwing
them
out
into
the
county
where
they
have
their
own
--
the
rights
to
vote
there
or
the
right
to
vote
with
other
things
in
the
county
with
this.
that's
where
you
finally
get
through
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
with
that
regard
to
the
number,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
talking
about,
narrowly
is,
the
use
of
a
number
for
the
proof.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
if
it's
provable,
i
believe
i
can
understand
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
gets
--
your
case
gets
down,
doesn't
not,
to
where
you've
got
to
look
at
the
area,
that
evidence

judgment

to
show
the

to
legislation
in
passing
this

law.
justice

is
that

is
that
a
general
factor?

how
long

i
thought
it's

in

black
i
remember
(voice

many
years
ago
(inaudible)
justice

black
i
have
an
idea
although
it
maybe
wrong
until
they
could
tell
us.
justice

black
would
that
(inaudible)
grab
that
and
make
arrest
for
offensive
committed
in
the
city?
justice

black
it
may
mean
much
more.
justice

black
(voice

is
part
of
the
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
why.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
elect
there
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
that
you're
arguing
based
on
the
premises,
they
have
to
accept
on
the
allegations
of
the
bill
that
this
was
done
by
the
purpose
of
excluding
these
people
to
see
that
none
of
them
stayed
in
the
city
of
tuskegee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
you
--
as
i
understand
your
argument,
if
i
--
if
i
get
the
distinction,
it
is
when
you
have
a
situation
like
this
where
a
law
has
been
passed,
which
cuts
out
the
colored
people
from
the
area
and
puts
them
--
creates
a
--
decreases
the
size
of
the
city.
it
leaves
them
on
the
outside
of
that
city.
and
so
if
you
look
at
it
and
see
the
--
the
effect
of
it
is,
is
that
they
deprived
the
living
of
having
the
area
on
which
they
live
inside
the
city
so
that
they
can
get
the
advantage,
that
--
that
violates
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
it
does
and
we
look
--
merely
what
it
does
without
thinking
about
why
they
did
it,
what
it
does
regarding
the
allegation
which
i
understand.
we
created
the
boundaries
of
tuskegee
in
such
ways
that
they
eliminate
them
merely
all
of
the
colored
voters,
so
that
they
were
no
longer
in
that
area,
but
they
would
put
outside
of
the
area
and
if
they
claim,
it
has
the
rights
to
do
it,
they
go
to
the
appellate
and
came
down
with
the
city's
standards.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
claim,
well
--
if
that,
that's
one
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
arguing
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
gather
that
you're
also
saying
that
it
creates
a
burden
on
the
right
to
vote
because
of
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
trouble
i
have
to
that,
i'm
not
talking
about
an
ultimate
conclusion
of
what
happened.
the
trouble
i
have
is
--
is
the
difficulty
i
have
in
drawing
the
conceptual
distinction
between
an
argument
that
you
don't
have
to
think
a
call
about
what
is
done
from
it.
but
you
just
look
to
see
its
effect
and
of
course,
at
each
instance,
without
voting
rights
of
people
have
changed,
when
they're
against
a
new
territory,
are
cutout
since
they
are
drove
in
this
problem.
this
case
illustrates
the
new
failures
of
the
fight
that's
been
going
on.
most
of
us
are
familiar
with
the
tribes
from
those
who
lived
on
there,
outside
in
a
both
hand,
what
(inaudible)
done
that
vested
right
not
to
be
in
the
municipality.
this
is
a
new
face
of
it,
brought
on
by
this
that
you
found
it
(inaudible)
but
i
--
i
can't
see
myself
how
you
can
go
on,
wholly
on
the
basis
that
you
don't
have
to
have
evidence.
well,
were
--
in
your
judgment
would
be
admissible
to
show
that
they
also
have
a
bill,
stated
that
was
his
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
something
like
the
evidence
that
happened
from
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
it's
technic,
but
--
but
actually
it
is.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it
though,
you
finally
get,
whether
you
called
it
purpose
or
something
else.
it
seems
to
me,
it
has
to
be
met
and
what
you
get
to,
i'm
not
saying
it
has
to
be
made.
what
you
get
to
is
this,
that
you
--
it's
claimed
here
that
if
a
state
exercises
its
general
power
to
change
the
boundaries
of
municipality
in
way
this
has,
in
such
ways
it
bar
a
great
many
people
in
remaining
in
the
city,
in
that
area
who
have
lived
there
before
and
they
are
--
are
actually
all
--
are
all
(inaudible)
in
color.
but
that's
enough
to
say
that
the
state
has
changed
the
boundaries
of
its
municipality
on
the
basis
of
color
and
they
can't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
make
--
make
a
quote
enough
to
what
i
was
about
trying
to
get
from
you
to
this.
is
this
the
point
which
we
have
to
read
that
you
have
legislations
there
which
it
produce
the
size
of
the
city
in
a
way
that
takes
practically
all
the
colored
people
out
of
it,
moving
them
into
a
different
area,
keep
the
others
in
there?
is
that
--
that
you
say,
is
forbidden
to
the
state
because
you
can
look
at
it
and
see
that
it
was
done
on
the
basis
of
color
and
the
--
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
forbids
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
they
can't
change
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can't
change
the
area
of
the
city
at
all
on
the
basis
of
color?
