mr.
fred
d.
gray
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
is
divided
into
two
parts.
i
shall
present
to
the
court
the
statement
of
a
fact
and
its
surrounding
circumstances.
mr.
carter
will
argue
the
questions
of
law
applicable
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
we
feel
that
the
facts
in
this
case,
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
are
so
important
that
we
help
reproduced
an
enlarged
copy
of
the
--
of
exhibit
2
that
is
attached
to
the
complaint
which
appears
on
page
13
of
the
record.
they
--
the
court,
in
understanding
the
facts,
we
shall
periodically
refer
to
this
map
in
the
(inaudible),
pointing
out
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir,
that
is
an
enlargement
of
the
exhibit
on
page
13
of
the
record.
we
shall
periodically
refer
to
this
map
pointing
out
certain
facts
as
alleged
in
the
complaint.
this
is
a
class
action
instituted
by
12
negroes
who
are
former
residents
in
the
city
of
tuskegee,
alabama,
as
the
limits
of
that
city
were
front
to
the
enactment
of
act
no.
140.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
the
original
limits
extend
the
southern
boundaries
to
this
land,
the
northern
boundaries
to
this
land,
the
western
boundaries
to
the
land
here
and
the
eastern
boundaries
to
the
land
here.
those
are
the
limits
as
they
exist
prior
to
the
enactment
of
act
no.
140.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
the
black
line
represents
the
present
boundary.
140
changed
the
land
which
was
withdrawing
it
from
here
to
this
point
and
it
made
these
various
figures
as
indicating
cutting
in
certain
areas.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
no,
sir.
it
was
in
the
black
line
represents
what
is
in
the
municipality
and
what's
on
the
outside
represents
what
formally
was
in
the
municipality.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
but
i'm
sure
it
has
been
in
existence
for
some
over
10
years,
i
believe.
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
tuskegee
institute
is
here,
in
the
northwest
corner.
it
is
no
longer
in
the
city.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
it
is
now
outside.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
the
institute
was
founded
in
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
i
believe
it
was
1860,
in
1860
something,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
sir?
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
i'm
not
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
the
--
this
class
action
is
on
behalf
of
12
negroes.
all
12
of
these
negroes
lived
in
various
areas
outside
of
the
present
city
but
within
the
former
city
limits
of
tuskegee.
the
action
originated
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama.
and
the
district
court
there
dismissed
petitioners'
complaint
without
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
from
that
action,
the
petitioners
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
divided
court
affirmed
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
complaint
alleged
the
challenge,
the
constitutionality
of
act
140,
which
act,
as
i
have
just
indicated,
changed
these
boundaries
from
their
old
position
to
their
present
position.
petitioners
alleged
that
the
bill
on
its
face
does
not
disclose
any
purpose
for
redefining
the
act.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
it
is
not
amiss
valid
of
any
kind,
it
is
simply
a
file
of
the
county
as
a
whole.
petitioners
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
macon
county.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
which
tuskegee
is
the
county
sit.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
the
old
population
was
approximately
just
better
than
6000.
we
are
unable
to
determine
now
the
new
boundaries.
a
census
has
just
been
taken
and
those
figures
are
not
available
at
this
time.
petitioners
have
alleged
that
the
obvious
purpose
and
the
sole
purpose
for
the
enactment
of
this
statute
is
to
deprive
petitioners
and
the
class
they
represent
of
the
right
to
be
residents
of
the
city
of
tuskegee
to
deny
them
the
right
to
vote
in
municipal
election
solely
because
of
their
race
and
color.
we
further
allege
in
the
complaint
that
this
exclusionary
purpose
and
the
effect
is
revealed
among
other
things
back
the
map
and
about
all
the
matters
which
we
shall
call
to
the
court's
attention
as
we
proceed.
now,
a
--
in
comparing
the
old
limits
of
the
city
with
the
present
limits,
we
have
the
following
after
effects
prior
to
the
enactment
of
act
no.
140,
the
city,
as
you
can
see
in
the
perfect
square
was
a
square.
now,
the
city
begins
at
this
point.
it
weaves
around
and
as
best
we
can
detect,
it
includes
--
it
has
28-different
size.
before
the
act,
the
entire
population
of
the
city
--
negro
population
of
the
city
was
5397.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
5397
is
the
negro
popula
--
or
was
the
negro
population
of
the
city
prior
to
the
act.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
out
of
the
total
population
of
6000
--
6600,
about
6700.
now,
out
of
the
5397
negro
residents
prior
to
the
act,
there
were
400
qualified
negro
voters.
since
the
act,
all
of
the
concentrated
areas,
a
negro
resident
has
been
excluded,
for
example,
the
tuskegee
institute
area
and
the
area
on
the
north
east
side
of
the
city
and
on
the
southwest
side
of
the
city
going
on
u.s.
highway
80
going
west
towards
montgomery.
all
of
these
are
concentrated
negro
areas
and
all
of
these
have
been
put
outside
the
city.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
what
--
what
i
mean
is
that
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir,
they
did.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
for
all
elections
beginning
with
your
municipal
election
all
the
way
through
presidential
election.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir,
there
is
a
mayor
and
a
commission
of
formal
government
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
--
city
council
of
former
government.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
we
have
a
county
vote
of
revenue
and
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
they
are
elected
but
from
the
county
as
a
whole
as
well
as
from
residents
of
tuskegee.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
exactly
and
just
within
the
last
month,
there
has
been
a
city
election
and
these
negroes
were
not
permitted
to
vote
in
that
election.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
the
entire
school
system
in
macon
county
is
a
county
school
system,
so
the
school
system
at
search
was
not
affected.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
since
the
act,
there
are
now
only
four
or
five
negro
voters
in
tuskegee.
before
the
act,
tuskegee
contained
approximately
1310
white
persons
of
whom
approximately
600
are
registered
voters
in
the
city.
tuskegee
still
contains
1310
white
persons
and
it
still
contain
approximately
600
white
voters.
in
other
words,
as
a
result
of
changing
all
of
these
boundaries
not
one
white
person
as
well
as
we've
been
able
to
ascertain
has
been
excluded,
for
example,
going
east
on
u.s.
80
(inaudible).
there
are
white
residents
along
the
highway.
so
the
city
limit
extends
outlook
along
80
east
and
includes
the
white
persons
and
extending
in
the
opposite
direction
on
80
west
where
negroes
resides.
the
city
limit
is
only
about
three
or
four
blocks
from
the
downtown
section.
this
action
must
be
considered,
we
submit,
in
the
light
of
the
racial
composition
of
macon
county
and
the
history
and
in
the
light
of
the
racial
composition
of
macon
county.
for
example,
macon
--
the
residence
of
negroes
in
macon
county
has
had
substantial
difficulty
in
getting
registered.
approximately,
78%
of
the
persons
in
macon
county
are
negroes,
leaving
only
18%
white.
a
constitutional
amendment
to
the
alabama
constitution
now
gives
the
legislature
the
authority
to
abolish
macon
county
and
divide
its
territory
into
the
adjoining
counties
if
the
need
arises.
the
complaint
further
alleges
that
act
140
is
another
device
in
a
continuing
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
alabama
to
disenfranchise
negro
residents
of
macon
county
of
which
tuskegee
is
the
county
seat.
the
complaint
further
alleges
that
the
admitted
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
assure
continued
white
control
of
tuskegee
city
election.
macon
county
had
no
vote
of
registrars
to
qualify
applicants
for
more
than
18
months
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed.
and
since
that
time,
a
vote
of
registrars
has
been
appointed
in
macon
county
but
only
three
negroes
has
been
qualified,
which
means
that
over
a
period
of
some
four
years,
only
three
negroes
has
been
able
to
become
registered
voters
in
macon
county.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
what
we're
saying
is,
your
honor,
is
that
this
act,
and
we've
alleged
this
in
our
complaint,
should
be
considered
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
no
more,
your
honor,
than
the
few
negroes
who
still
remained
in
tuskegee
who
are
not
registered
will
have
difficulty
getting
registered
as
--
is
illustrated
by
the
difficulty
that
they've
had
over
30
years
to
get
registered.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
it
is
my
understanding
that
they
are.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
now,
in
certain
areas,
i
think
the
city
also
owns
the
utilities
but
the
utilities
are
still
furnished
but
they
pay
for
it.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
i
understand
there
has
been
a
curtailment
in
police
patrol
of
the
areas.
for
example,
as
we
allege
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
some
of
the
areas,
yes,
sir,
because
they
are
still
within
the
--
some
of
the
areas
are
still
within
the
police
jurisdiction
of
the
city.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
of
the
city.
in
addition
to
the
city
limits,
then
the
city
still
controls
to
some
degree
the
--
the
police
jurisdiction
which
prior
to
the
enactment
of
this
law
extended
for
some
three
miles
beyond
the
actual
city
limits
but
those
persons
in
the
police
jurisdiction
are
not
illegible
to
vote
in
municipal
elections.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
well,
there
is
a
substantial
question
with
reference
to
that
because
our
state
statute
states
that
a
city
whose
population
is
6000
and
over,
the
--
the
boundary
is
extent
to
three
miles.
if
it's
less
than
6000,
then
it
should
extend
from
mile
and
a
half.
and
by
the
substantial
reduction
in
--
in
area,
as
we
understand
it,
it
would
mean
that
the
present
city
in
tuskegee
is
less
than
6000
so
the
--
the
police
jurisdiction
would
only
be
a
mile
and
a
half.
and
it
would
in
some
instances,
in
other
instances,
it
would
not.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
no,
sir.
a
mile
and
half
from
this
point
to
here
is
farther
than
mile
and
a
half.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
it
is
farther.
i'm
saying
from
this
point,
the
end
of
the
city
limit
is
here
to
the
other
areas
of
old
city,
in
my
opinion,
if
it's
farther
than
a
mile
and
a
half.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
i
have
to
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
it
would
be
difficult
without
construing
to
the
scale
on
the
map,
your
honor.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
d.
gray
the
scale
is
800
feet
2
inches,
i
think.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
800
feet
2
inches.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
that's
right.
mr.
fred
d.
gray
well,
it
has
appeared
from
this
point
to
the
end,
same
would
be
followed
(inaudible).
we
submit
that
the
complaint
further
alleges
that
the
purpose
and
the
effect
of
this
act
is
to
deny
negroes
the
right
to
vote
solely
because
of
their
race
and
color
that
the
act
deprives
--
deprived
petitioners
of
the
right
to
participate
in
other
activities
as
residence
in
the
city
of
tuskegee
solely
because
of
their
race
and
color
in
violation
of
the
fourteen
amendment
of
the
united
state
constitution
and
the
fifteen
amendment.
mr.
carter
will,
at
this
time,
argue
the
law
in
the
case.
