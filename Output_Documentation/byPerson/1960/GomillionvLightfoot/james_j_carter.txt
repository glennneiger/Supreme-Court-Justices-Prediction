mr.
james
j.
carter
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
if
i
may
before
getting
into
the
main
part
of
my
argument,
answer
a
few
questions
that
were
asked
yesterday
that
was
not
cleared
up.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
when
tuskegee
institute
was
organized.
it
was
in
1881.
you
also
asked
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
about
the
previous
boundaries
of
tuskegee.
tuskegee
was
first
organized
in
1866
with
the
boundary
of
2.5
miles
on
each
side,
the
boundaries
being
equidistant
from
the
then
courthouse.
in
1868,
by
an
act
of
the
legislature,
those
boundaries
were
pulled
in
to
an
area
of
1
mile
square.
history
gives
some
very
interesting
side
lights
of
why
that
was
done.
later
on,
they
were
expanded
again.
there
have
been
several
acts
and
i
believe
the
last
act
that
really
touched
the
boundaries
in
any
significance
was
an
act
of
1898,
which
again
placed
the
manner
in
this
position
2.5
miles
square.
the
question
was
asked
as
to
following
police
jurisdiction.
that's
a
general
statute
of
alabama
applicable
to
all
towns
and
cities,
in
towns
having
a
population
of
6000
people
according
to
the
last
federal
census,
the
police
limits
are
3
miles
beyond
the
corporate
limits
and
in
towns
of
less
than
6000
is
1.5.
tuskegee
at
the
present
time
has
police
jurisdiction
of
3
miles
beyond
the
new
city
limits
by
reason
of
the
fact
as
we
haven't
had
the
official
1960
census,
we
yet
announced
nor
have
we
had
a
legislature
meet
as
it
will
next
year
after
the
announcing
of
that.
it's
a
--
the
population
of
tuskegee
is
less
than
6000
without
the
next
legislature
then
of
course,
we'll
refer
it
back
to
the
1.5
mile
limit.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
meets
next
may.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
carter
and
you
have
this
too,
that
you
have
the
united
states
census
being
out
of
guilt
because
as
i
understand
it,
they're
going
by
these
boundaries.
now
and
then
the
police
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes.
mr.
james
j.
carter
it
means
this
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
they
have
a
power
to
arrest,
to
answer
calls
and
to
actually
patrol
the
area
in
most
cities
do.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
furnish
police
and
fire
protection
to
the
entire
area.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
this
entire
area
here,
they
have
water
and
electricity
which
is
--
they
have
municipal
electric
plant
which
furnishes
this
entire
--
none
of
this
has
been
withdrawn.
mr.
james
j.
carter
they
pay
for
water
and
electricity,
but
these
people
that
have
been
on
the
outside
of
this
city
paid
no
city
taxes.
in
other
words,
since
1957,
no
--
no
city
taxes,
the
only
taxes
levy
within
the
police
jurisdiction
off
of
businesses.
now,
business
organizations
pay
one-half
the
license
that
people
within
they
(inaudible)
would
pay
and
that
is
based
on
if
they
--
they
do
get
the
police
and
fire
protection
and
these
health
services.
mr.
james
j.
carter
well,
no,
they
don't
have
garbage
collection
as
such
but
i
mean
they
have
the
advantage
of
coming
into
the
city
health
department,
of
any
of
that,
it
goes
to
have
the
water
in
the
sewage
lines,
which
of
course
are
available
there
and
are
huge.
now,
we
also
point
out
here
as
to
the
population
of
this
area,
the
way
it
was
drawn,
the
little
argument
they
pulled
in,
you
will
see
here,
for
example,
a
rather
heavily
populated
neighborhood.
that's
--
that's
a
negro
neighborhood
there,
which
begins
out
here
and
it
goes
way
off.
now,
we
are
in
a
position
here
drawing
lines
that
we
must
if
those
people
wanted
to
do,
so
you
must
come
in
the
city.
you're
discriminating
against
this
because
we're
colored.
that's
another
point.
now,
i
believe
mr.
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
i'm
saying
here
that
that
gets
back
to
the
point.
i
believe
that
one
of
the
justice,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
someone
asked
that
if
you
had
people
on
the
outside
the
city
in
the
area,
if
you
would
be
discriminating
against
them
if
you
didn't
take
them
in.
and
so
that
would
illustrate
that
particular
point
if
these
people
in,
say
green,
would
open
here,
wanted
to
come
in
the
city.
mr.
james
j.
carter
never
been,
no,
sir.
now,
i
believe
yesterday
there
was
some
method
asked
about
the
procedure
for
changing
boundaries.
the
constitution
of
alabama
provides
and
this
act
was
not
as
--
the
first
counsel
suggested
a
private
act.
it
was
a
local
law.
pass
after
notice
and
proof
regarding
to
our
constitution,
to
pass
such
a
law,
you
have
to
advertise
it
for
weeks.
that's
to
give
the
people
affected,
i
tend
to
come
in
and
protest
if
they
desire
to
do
so.
as
far
as
i
know,
there's
no
--
this
--
this
law
is
advertised,
no
protest
was
ever
made.
now,
that's
a
perfectly
legal
and
been
upheld
by
our
state
supreme
court
as
being
the
proper
way
to
change
boundaries.
in
fact,
nearly
all
boundaries
in
alabama
changed
that
way,
harm
the
session
of
legislation
of
what
means.
but
you
won't
have
50
to
100
boundary
line
changes.
there's
probably
been
thousands
since
our
constitution
in
1909.
now,
there
is
--
there
are
other
ways
of
changing
boundaries.
for
example,
in
the
city,
the
city
made
by
--
initiate
its
own
proceeding.
the
counsel
may
propose
it
and
by
--
present
it
to
the
probate
judge
and
then
by
popular
election,
bring
in
additional
territory.
you
could
also
contract
the
city
that
same
way
the
city
here
could
initiate
it.
this
was
state
action,
however
not
city
action.
this
was
done
by
the
state
legislature.
also
i
thought
as
to
fact
that
a
--
that
people,
75
or
more
people,
may
form
a
municipality.
in
other
words
the
people
outside
here,
they
form
their
own
municipality
if
they
care
to
do
so
and
may
initiate
the
action
and
carry
it
right
through
separate
by
a
popular
vote.
now,
i
believe
that
probably
gets
us
down
except
to
one
thing
that
mr.
justice
stewart
makes
in
the
essence
that
the
district
judge
characterized
this
as
a
sea
dragon.
that
was
the
plaintiffs
that
characterized
the
sea
dragon.
he
put
it
in
quotes
in
his
opinion.
now,
as
we
look
at
it,
it
might
be
a
bit
of
a
descriptive
term
and
it
would
take
ones
imagination
but
that's
not
too
unusual
looking
outfit
when
we
look
somewhere
in
the
cities
in
the
united
states.
and
last
night
i
haven't
pick
up
to
run
magnetic
road
add
list
and
of
course
we've
been
a
good
bit
out
of
this
record
all
the
way
through,
so
we
might
just
mention
someone
--
man
in
town
of
pennsylvania.
i
suppose
it
looks
more
like
a
cloud.
these
boys,
they
used
to
lay
on
the
grass
and
watch
the
clouds
and
figure
what
it
looks
like.
concord,
new
hampshire,
stanford,
connecticut,
scranton,
pennsylvania,
it
looks
likes
a
jigsaw
puzzle
sitting
on
top
of
the
other,
cincinnati,
ohio
by
this
bed,
even
sacramento
california
(inaudible).
so
you
just
don't
know
why
the
city
has
the
boundary
lines
it
has
but
let's
get
down
now
to
what
i
consider.
if
your
honor
please,
to
meet
and
the
(inaudible)
in
this
case.
and
that
is
this
and
finally
after
being
in
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
finally
for
the
first
time
on
page
11
in
the
petitioner's
brief
is
we
have
to
get
them
to
admit
there
were
such
cases
as
hunter
versus
pittsburgh
and
laramie
county
versus
albany
county.
the
hunter
versus
pittsburgh
and
laramie
county
versus
albany
county,
mount
pleasant
versus
beckwith
are
the
cases
upon
which
we
stood
in
the
lower
court
of
the
fundamental
merits
here.
and
that
is
the
power
of
a
state
acting
through
its
legislature
as
a
sovereign
right
to
extend
comfort
limits,
to
draw
him
in,
to
consolidate
cities
or
to
abolish
it.
that's
true
of
counties
and
it's
true
cities.
the
first
case
only
said,
it
was
the
old
laramie
county
versus
albany
county
which
involves
county
lines
and
of
course
the
county
is
simply
a
political
subdivision
of
the
state.
it's
a
creation
of
the
state
created
for
the
convenient
administration
of
government.
shortly
after
that,
we
came
to
mount
pleasant
versus
beckwith
where
they,
again,
pointed
out
that
corporations
are
composed
of
all
the
inhabits
of
the
territory,
all
the
people
who
lived
within
the
territory.
and
they
see
that
the
organization
and
the
territory
maybe
modified
and
i'm
now
quoting
from
court
by
the
mere
wheel
of
the
legislature.
now,
that
goes
back,
if
the
court
pleases,
to
other
quotations
we
look
into
this
constitutional
limitation.
we
find
professor
coolidge
saying
that
they
may
as
a
political
manner
the
drawing
of
boundary
lines
for
cities
and
political
subdivision
peculiar
that
vested
in
the
state.
and
it
says
this,
"if
the
legislative
action
in
these
cases
operate
injuriously
to
the
municipalities
or
to
individuals,
the
remedy
is
not
with
the
courts.
the
courts
have
no
file
to
interfere
and
the
people
must
be
looked
to,
to
write
through
the
ballot
box
all
these
wrongs.
mr.
james
j.
carter
i
assume
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
alright,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
carter
alright.
mr.
james
j.
carter
alright,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
carter
which
either
one
or
we
take
all
of
them
mr.
james
j.
carter
alright
sir.
let's
take
mount
pleasant
versus
beckwith
that
was
a
question
of
creating
municipal
corporations
out
of
parts
of
other
corporations.
in
that
case,
the
main
issue
involved
was
a
question.
mr.
james
j.
carter
alright,
there
was
a
city,
the
city
was
complaining
about
having
to
take
on
debts
of
another
city.
now,
that
was
a
city
action.
now
hunter
versus
--
kelly
versus
pittsburgh,
if
we
take
that
one,
was
where
the
city
around
the
state
increase
the
limits
and
brought
in
mr.
kelly's
farmlands.
they
brought
about
80
acres
of
farmlands
and
mr.
kelly,
an
individual,
came
in
and
said,
"you
are
depriving
me
of
my
property
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
this
is
what
you
do
with
it.
i've
got
farmlands.
you've
increased
my
tax
rate.
i've
got
to
come
in
and
pay
for
all
the
services
of
pittsburgh.
you
are
charging
me
$2100
a
year
of
taxes
when
i've
only
got
$800
income."
in
that
case
went
all
the
way
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
had
case
say
it,
that
didn't
make
any
difference
of
what
he
said
what
portion
of
state
shall
be
within
the
limits
of
the
city
and
governed
by
its
authorities
and
its
laws
has
always
been
considered
to
be
subject
of
proper
legislation.
and
he
goes
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
it
was
most
on
that.
mr.
james
j.
carter
that's
all,
yes,
sir.
i
might
be
frank
to
say,
none
of
these
cases
involve
a
racial
situation,
not
in
hunter.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
carter
and
the
people
in
that
municipality
to
a
state
and
the
municipality.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir,
just
in
tuskegee,
the
--
the
city
tuskegee
was
originally
organized
by,
its
boundaries
defined
by
the
states
and
most
recently
defined
by
the
state,
not
in
hunter.
so
there
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
that
would
be
--
that
would
be
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
that
would
be
true
if
you
wanted
to
get
something
directed.
now,
i'll
admit
that
i
don't
have
a
white
horse
case
on
this
but
i
do
have
the
law
which
has
been
followed
and
affirmed
and
reaffirmed
in
every
state
in
this
union.
mr.
james
j.
carter
language
if
you
please.
yes,
sir,
i
think
it's
a
law
because
i
believe
it's
been
repeated
and
i
think
it's
been
followed
by
this
court
that
it
has
--
just
because
i
don't
agree
with
judge
brown
in
his
dissent
and
said,
"you've
only
got
one
case
that
had
been
decided
in
the
--
this
century."
well,
i
don't
think
because
the
case
is
old
and
it
makes
it
bad
law,
but
not
in
hunter.
we
said
this
and
they
go
back
to
it
and
i
agree
with
you.
there
was
a
question
of
bringing
--
allocating
in
to
pittsburgh.
we
are
allocating
they
had
a
nice
little
town
and
they
had
all
their
debts
paid
and
they
had
all
of
their
facilities
in
pittsburgh
was
trying
to
do
everything
in
going
that
going
there.
but
they
said
this,
"we
have
nothing
to
do,
was
the
policy,
wisdom,
justice
are
bad
as
to
act
under
consideration."
those
questions
are
that
the
court
--
the
consideration
of
those
whom
the
state
has
entrusted
this
legislative
power.
it
goes
on
to
discuss
what
municipal
cooperation
that
they
are
simply
political
subdivision.
then
says
a
state
may
add
its
pleasure,
modify
withdraw
those
powers,
extend
the
contract
to
territorial
area.
and
said
that
all
these
respects,
the
state
is
supreme
and
its
legislative
body
conforming
his
action
to
the
state
constitution
may
do
it
as
it
will
on
the
restrain
by
any
provision
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
we
take
flat
foot
in
the
position
in
this
case,
that
this
is
a
case
within
the
confidence
of
the
state
of
alabama
to
fix
the
boundaries
of
his
municipalities.
mr.
james
j.
carter
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
that
be
a
fast
statement
of
my
position.
that's
one
of
my
positions
and
three
but
i
take
that
as
you
take
it.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
as
a
legal
absolute
and
one
is
become
so
firmly
and
--
embedded
and
the
jurisprudence
to
this
country
that
i
think
would
be
getting
into
a
real
ticket
if
we
ever
got
beyond
it.
now,
as
your
honor
pointed
out
for
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir
mr.
james
j.
carter
of
course
to
that
extend
mr.
justice
whittaker
i
won't
say
that
--
that
there's
no
possible
situation
that
it
might
not
be
abused.
but
i
do
say
this.
i
think
it's
a
matter
even
then,
that
the
states
himself
should
have
an
opportunity
to
correct
by
going
to
the
state
courts
to
do
it.
if
--
if
they
did
get
off
base
on
something
like
that.
for
example,
in
many
things,
that
the
courts
have
said
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed
out
in
colegrove
versus
green
that
courts
just
can't
do.
that
--
that
--
to
some
extend,
he
pointed
out
for
example
that
we
have
some
constitutional
guarantees
that
--
that
can't
be
enforced
for
example
the
guarantee
of
a
republican
form
of
government,
the
congressional
regulation
of
the
indian
tribes,
the
legislative
executive
control
of
foreign
relations,
the
control
of
civilian
and
military
appointing
power.
they
only
get
the
civilian
and
military
appointing
power,
just
keep
touch
it.
this
court
has
decided
that
recently.
the
inherit
wisdom
of
any
legislative
executive
policy,
if
you
were
to
see
that
laws
have
faithfully
executed.
and
then
we
go
on
beyond
the
fact
that
stay
on
boundary
lines,
we've
got
the
old
cases
from
this
court
of
benson
versus
united
states
were
there.
a
man
was
on
trial
for
his
very
life.
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was,
did
this
occur
on
fort
leavenworth
military
reservation,
didn't
it?
and
he
took
the
position
that
it
was
all
land
owned
by
the
government
but
he
had
never
used
it
for
reservation
and
to
show
what
answer
to
it
was
the
executive
as
determined
that
these
are
the
boundary
lines
of
fort
leavenworth
reservation
and
that
is
it.
and
in
that
case,
it
went
all
to
all
the
proposition
that
there
was
--
there
were
things
within
the
legislative
an
executive
field
and
throughout
the
cases
and
all
of
them
and
every
state
of
country
as
(inaudible)
hunter
and
laramie
and
the
others,
they
have
consistently
held
that
the
drawing
of
boundary
line
in
cities
is
a
legislative
and
not
a
judicial
function.
we
come
back
to
this
proposition
in
this
case
to
--
to
get
to
the
racial
angle.
of
course,
we
would
have
to
go
back
and
see
what
the
legislatures
--
legislature
meant.
of
course
we
speak
of
intent
and
reaching
of
intent
and
construction
of
legislation
and
--
and
that's
true.
but
of
course
that's
an
ambiguous
legislation
where
--
where
we
always
go
back
to
commit
a
reports.
here,
there
is
none.
there's
nothing
in
the
act.
there's
nothing
to
construe
in
the
statute
from
that
end.
these
are
the
boundary
line
period.
that's
the
only
boundary
line.
now,
when
we
come
to
motive
and
motive
is
really
what
we're
talking
about.
we
can
fence
around
whether
it
is
purpose
or
intention.
the
purpose
and
intention
i
believe
in
south
versus
peters,
there,
the
contention
was
made
that
the
purpose
are
effect
of
the
act,
it
was
worthy
use
but
this
court
still
went
off
there.
it
didn't
go
into
that.
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
go
to
the
proof
act.
but
this
court
has
said
repeatedly.
and
we
go
back
to
the
duplix
printing
co.
&
press
case
that
even
on
acts
of
congress,
you
can't
take
what
legislator
say
and
read
into
that
the
motive
behind
it.
it
just
can't
be
done.
and
we
go
back
to
the
verb
beginning
of
this
country
fletcher
versus
peck.
that
was
a
case
where
it
was
alleged
that
the
legislators
of
the
state
of
georgia
had
bribed
to
pass
certain
legislation
to
make
land
grants.
and
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
refused
in
that
case
to
even
inquire
into
it,
saying
that
the
motives
could
not
be
inquired
into.
the
courts
consistently
followed
that
line.
mr.
justice
holmes,
in
koller
versus
the
people
of
michigan
said
that,
knowledge,
negatives
or
manners
or
motives
of
legislators
will
not
be
inquired
into.
terry
versus
(inaudible)
reaffirmed
the
principle,
arizona
versus
california,
again
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
where
it
was
alleged
that
the
numbers
of
congress
had
some
ulterior
motives
in
trying
to
pass
that
act.
somehow,
it
was
trying
to
do
it
for
personal
reasons
and
to
--
to
make
a
lot
a
money,
and
they
said
motives
which
induce
members
of
congress.
to
pass
a
boulder
canyon
project
act
will
not
be
inquired
to.
there
are
things
with
which
the
court
may
not
inquire.
and
we
say
there
we
can
talk
about
motive
or
purpose
or
affect,
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
and
they
want
to
go
here
to
certain
--
they
wanted
quote
for
example
from
what
the
newspaper
said
that
the
author
of
this
act
said,
when
he
first
advertised
it,
before
it
was
introduced
in
the
legislature.
they
even
go
so
far
in
the
record
as
to
cite
an
article
from
the
new
york
times,
time
magazine.
now,
may
it
please
the
court
if
we
have
to
get
the
part
of
determining
motives
of
what
people
mean
by
what
magazines
say
about
us
or
about
our
courts
or
about
our
legislature.
we
have
put
in
bad
shape
because
we
just
can't
always
determine
motives
that
way.
now,
to
my
third
point,
to
me
i
think
it
is
an
important
part,
and
that's
the
question
of
judicial
restraint
in
cases
of
this
kind.
we
have
a
number
of
cases,
we
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
james
j.
carter
no
sir,
i
think
the
decision
to
this
court
it
may
deter
that
when
you
have
the
statute
says,
it
has
to
be
stricken
down,
if
you
done
that
in
the
school
segregation
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
alabama,
we
do
have
a
constitutional
provision
of
segregation.
but
we
are
not
here
inline
upon
that.
we
realize
that
there's
been
a
change
of
climate
and
that
the
recent
decisions
will
clarify
those
points.
and
what
i'm
saying
here,
understanding
flatfootedly
upon
the
proposition,
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
whether
it's
says
there's
been
a
boundary
change.
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
do
it,
there
is
nothing
here
as
was
pointed
out
before.
negroes
live
within
tuskegee.
negroes
live
without
tuskegee.
they
may
change
boundaries.
nobody
has
been
removed
from
tuskegee
except
that
there's
some
territory
that
has
been
attached
from
a
municipal
corporation.
now,
the
single
--
it
--
it
doesn't
affect
the
schools.
it
doesn't
affect
the
services
at
all.
a
simple
question
of
drawing
lines
that
--
that
territory
that
was
watched
within
certain
limits,
metes
and
bounds
and
now
no
longer
there.
the
metes
and
bounds
are
different,
and
they
are
different
because
of
people
that
have
a
rights
to
draw
or
drew.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir,
i
probably
would.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
i
say
that.
mr.
james
j.
carter
of
course
your
honor
to
ask
that
and
well-pleaded
though,
you
must
to
have
something
that's
susceptible
of
proof
and
relevancy.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
j.
carter
i
am.
mr.
james
j.
carter
i
say
it
is
because
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
speak
to
the
state
of
alabama.
now,
i
don't
represent
the
state
of
alabama
in
this
case,
but
i
would
say
this,
if
any
legislature
was
ever
foolish
enough
to
put
that
into
law,
i
think
it
should
be
not
advantage.
but
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
but
let
me
say
this
on
the
absolute.
i
would
say
this
that
if
purpose
was
admitted,
if
purpose
was
admitted,
i
think
that
without
overruling
hunter,
laramie
county
and
the
others
that
the
states
would
have
the
power
to
draw
their
boundary
line
regardless
of
the
purpose.
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes.
but
if
--
if
that
is
a
proposition,
in
other
words,
i
say
that
purpose
is
not
a
proper
inquiry
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
statute
means.
mr.
james
j.
carter
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
i
was
put
to
the
choice,
i
would
take
the
position
that
even
with
that
language,
we
would
have
uphold
it.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes.
mr.
james
j.
carter
you
may
look
of
course
and
see
what
a
statute
does,
but
i
don't
think
it's
awfully
see
the
line
and
i
don't
know
that
anybody's
ever
define
really
the
difference
between
motive
and
ultimate
purpose.
of
course
you
can
look
at
effect.
mr.
james
j.
carter
most
of
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
well,
of
course,
you
can
look
at
any
statute,
see
what
it
does.
you
look
at
this
statute
to
see
where
the
line
is.
now,
the
effect
of
that
line
to
see
and
who
lives
on
one
side
or
the
other,
i
don't
think
is
a
pertinent
inquiry
in
this
case.
mr.
james
j.
carter
no,
i
do
not
think
so
because
i
say
this.
we
--
i
get
back
again
to
the
proposition
that
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
draw
line.
somebody
has
put
that
power
in
it.
the
courts
can't
draw
the
line.
nobody
else
can
draw
that
line
that
they
have
drawn
it.
and
they've
drawn
it
in
a
--
in
a
way
that
is
compatible
with
the
constitution
of
state
of
alabama
and
i
say
it
should
hold.
mr.
james
j.
carter
because
there
again,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
how
we
could
determine
that
when
we
have
the
power
to
draw
a
line
without
going
back
and
say
really
what
is
a
motive
of
this
thing,
which
the
courts
had
said
you
cannot
inquire
into.
mr.
james
j.
carter
and
we
are
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
your
honor
please,
i
feel
to
see
here
the
constitutional
rights
that
have
been
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
--
of
those
courts.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes.
mr.
james
j.
carter
well,
of
course
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
i
think
of
course
it
would
be
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
--
in
the
proper
case
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
--
the
--
the
courts
always
find
a
way
to
--
to
look
into
matters
if
you
could
come
in
and
say
now,
"we've
got
a
case
here
with
absolute
violation
of
the
constitution."
but
we
have
constitutional
provisions
that
correlate,
that
mesh
in
together
and
we
have
one.
we
have
the
tenth
amendment,
which
says
the
states
are
supreme
in
certain
fields.
if
they
have
sovereign
power
to
the
old
government
and
here
they've
exercised
it
and
created
a
political
subdivision
to
carry
out
the
old
parts.
they
haven't
taken
away
anybody's
right
to
vote.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes,
and
they're
asking
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
but
this
--
this
decision
of
itself
what
they
ask,
if
your
honor
please,
is
to
go
into
motive,
to
go
into
purpose
and
to
tell
the
court
below,
and
as
he
pointed
out,
this
case
has
been
very
carefully
considered
by
two
courts
and
i
was
interested
to
know
that
they
realized
that.
it's
been
studied.
it's
been
studied
on
several
theories,
not
only
the
constitutional
issues
themselves
but
upon
the
question
of
judicial
restraint
in
the
statute.
the
court
below
looked
and
judge
wisdom
did,
that
this
is
about
as
highly
political
thing
as
anybody
can
get
into
as
to
where
boundary
lines
go.
if
we
start
drawing
boundary
lines
as
such
for
every
ward
and
every
precinct
and
everything
is
going
to
be
question
after
question.
now,
in
colegrove,
we
get
back
to
that.
in
that
case,
of
course,
was
your
congressional
redistricting.
it's
not
exactly
this
case
and
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
pronounced
any
absolutes
but
it
did
point
out
that
the
courts
generally
refrain
from
getting
into
the
political
figure
of
districting.
now,
this
is
not,
as
i
say,
a
congressional
district
but
it
does
draw
lines
of
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state
in
the
south
versus
peters,
where
again
we
had
the
question
of
the
georgia
unit
vote.
and
there,
the
courts
simply
went
all
from
the
proposition
that
it
was
a
political
question
because
it
wouldn't
get
into
it.
now,
there
was
a
dissent
to
that
case
and
the
argument
in
that
case
was
very
much
as
it
was
here.
the
argument
in
that
case
being
that
the
effect
and
purpose
of
the
georgia
unit
system,
its
purpose
and
effect
was
to
dilute
and
to
cut
down
on
the
vote
of
negroes,
and
i
believe,
labor,
but
this
court
nevertheless
with
justice
black
--
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
dissenting
held
in
that
case
that
it
was
not
a
matter
for
judicial
concern.
we
say
that
this
is
a
matter
of
local
policy.
we
say
as
the
cases
are
pointed
out
that
it's
a
question
of
local
policy,
purely
political,
that
the
courts
held
all
the
--
all
the
way
back,
not
only
these
matters
of
equity,
but
it's
a
matter
of
judicial
abstention
if
you
please
or
judicial
self-limitation
perhaps
would
be
the
better
word.
they
have
refused
to
go
in
to
cases
of
this
kind,
which
pose
the
line
drawing
political
questions
that
this
would
and
someone
said,
"then
what's
the
remedy?"
he
said
the
only
remedy
we
could
have
would
be
to
declare
this
act
unconstitutional.
of
course
there,
we
go
back
to
proposition
that
you
--
you've
got
intervening
rights
and
have
come
up
in
the
meantime.
we
have
this
act
that
was
passed
in
1957.
it
was
advertised
two
to
three
months
before
that.
nobody
felt
that
they
were
discriminated
against
it.
it
did
anything
to
almost
14
to
15
months
later.
and
then
they
decided
they
were
which
makes
you
wanted
sometimes
that
people
had
rather
have
a
lawsuit
than
to
try
--
use
their
right
to
petition
on
the
constitution
to
say,
"well,
i
don't
think
this
law
is
right
and
i
wish
you
wouldn't
do
it."
now,
we'd
assume
that
legislators
will
not
listen
to
anyone.
we'd
assume
that
their
right
of
petition
had
to
go
down
and
discuss
this
thing
as
they
don't
go
this
far,
but
go
somewhere
else.
you
--
you're
not
doing
the
right
by
us.
but
no,
the
matter
is
going
on.
they
accept
the
benefits
of
no
taxes.
accept
the
benefits
of
their
police
and
fire
protection.
but
now,
we
come
back
at
this
late
80s,
even
intervening
election
and
say,
"oh
no,
let's
get
into
this
thing
now
and
tell
us
maybe
where
the
line
should
be
drawn,"
and
say,
"but
all
the
courts
not
drawing
a
line."
well,
of
course
you
can
say
it
in
this
case,
but
if
we
draw
another
in
some
way
as
some
court
sometime
has
got
to
tell
us
how
far
we
can
go.
what
percentage
of
colored
and
white
there
must
be?
of
course,
somewhere,
sometime,
if
that
goes
on,
somebody's
got
to
draw
the
line.
mr.
james
j.
carter
every
four
years.
mr.
james
j.
carter
yes.
mr.
james
j.
carter
this
year,
september
was
the
election.
in
fact,
they're
electing
new
mayor.
he
hadn't
taken
office
yet,
but
they
elected
a
new
mayor.
mr.
james
j.
carter
for
four
years
unless
--
mr.
james
j.
carter
--
somebody
dies,
they
have
a
special
election,
that's
correct.
so
we
have
numerous
questions,
as
elections
void,
one
has
already
had
this
government
in
this
--
in
the
meantime
been
in
a
state
of
limbo,
just
what
is
the
situation.
so
we
respectfully
submit,
if
it
please
the
court,
in
this
case.
that
for
the
courts
below
to
grant
the
relief
that
these
petitioners
ask,
they
would
have
had
to
have
ignored
precedents
that
have
been
established,
reestablished,
affirmed
and
reaffirmed
throughout
the
history
of
america
jurisprudence.
and
we
go
back
and
we
say
again
in
the
terms
of
judge
wisdom.
we
think
he
put
very
wisely.
he
agreed
with
the
majority
opinion
and
he
--
he
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
on
this
question
of
judicial
self-limitation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
opinion
of
the
majority
and
the
opinion
of
minority,
as
well
as
dissent
could
well
make
the
briefs
in
this
case,
my
brief,
his
brief
because
they
have
covered
the
field
factor.
but
he
did
point
this
out
and
we'll
come
back
to
the
situation
in
this
case.
if
the
courts
are
to
end
in
this
statement,
the
cure
is
going
to
be
much
worse
than
disease
if
a
disease
really
