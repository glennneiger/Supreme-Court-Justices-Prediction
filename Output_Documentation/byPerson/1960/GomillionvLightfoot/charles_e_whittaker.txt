justice
charles

whittaker
now,
does
that
jurisdiction
as
i
understand
it
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
why
does
not
requires
(inaudible)
tell
me
would
it
go
for
a
mile
and
a
half
to
go
as
far
as
the
extreme
southwest
corner
shown
on
that
map
right
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
elman,
in
that
connection,
does
this
line
do
that?
is
there
a
provision
against
the
negro
only
filing
night,
day,
any
property
inside
the
line?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
true
but
i
will
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
would
assume
that
that
result
to
that
much
have
been
clever
basically
that
is
a
violation.
thus,
it
was
difficult
in
any
way,
ownership
by
any
ways
on
either
side.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
mr.
carter
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
could
this
lawful
power
construe
with
confidence
that
being
through
unconstitutional
objectives?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
carter,
if
you
were
here
in
this
lawsuit
formally
to
admit
purpose,
to
be
as
allege.
you'd
have
then,
would
you
not,
the
same
situation
as
hypothesized
by
mr.
justice
harlan?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
the
question
as
you
raised
now
is
that
there
can
be
no
proper
proof
of
motive.
that's
not
a
judicial
inquiry,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
this
is
an
exception
to
the
rule
that
facts
well-pleaded
or
admitted
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
your
point?
