in

(inaudible)

mr.
gray
--
justice

now,
what's
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
mr.
carter,
that
any
colored
residence
in
the
city
has
now
to
mind
who
are
not
voters?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
maybe
number
perhaps
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
about
negroes
residing
in
the
city
who
are
not
voters.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
true
then
i
think
that
the
ratio
of
five
to
one
doesn't
--
no
longer
obtains
within
the
city
that
was
withdrawn
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
no
more
than
about
200.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
so
than
five
to
one
ratio
is
just
a
reverse,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
carter,
if
you
had
a
declaratory
judgment
that
one
quoted,
it's
constitutionally
invalid
of
the
federal
constitution,
do
you
need
all
the
terms
that
(inaudible),
do
you
need
restraints
of
any
kind?
if
that
was
so,
would
that
--
just
not
destroy
the
reorganizations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
destroy
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
you
need
the
term
relief,
that's
what
i'm
asking.
