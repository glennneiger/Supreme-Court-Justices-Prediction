mr.
philip
elman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
because
of
the
fundamental
constitutional
rights
which
are
here
asserted
in
the
national
significance
of
the
issues,
united
states
is
appearing
in
this
case
as
amicus
curiae
and
supported
the
petitioners.
before
proceeding
with
the
argument,
i
should
like
if
i
may
by
way
of
response
to
question
from
the
bench
yesterday
to
state
that
according
to
an
official
report
of
the
united
states
bureau
of
the
census
in
january
1953.
the
area
of
the
city
of
tuskegee
as
it
existed
in
1950
and
prior
to
the
alteration
of
the
boundaries
made
by
the
1957
law.
the
area
of
the
city
then
was
6.3
square
miles.
in
other
words,
roughly
about
2.5
miles
square,
each
of
the
lines
on
the
trip
reading
about
2.5
miles.
now,
it's
perfectly
obvious
looking
at
the
face
of
the
map
considering
just
this
2.5
mile.
that
from
any
point
of
the
new
city
to
any
boundary
of
the
old
city
is
less
than
1.5
miles
which
as
was
stated
yesterday
has
some
significance
under
alabama
law,
title
37
section
9
of
the
alabama
code
of
1958
provides
that
the
police
jurisdiction
of
every
municipality
having
a
population
of
less
than
6000
which
is
now
the
case
as
to
new
tuskegee.
the
police
jurisdiction
extends
beyond
its
corporate
limits
for
1
and
1.5
miles,
is
another
provision
of
--
of
title
37
section
491
which
puts
upon
the
--
which
gives
the
municipality
the
power
of
maintaining
health
and
cleanliness
within
its
police
jurisdiction.
so
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
area
outside
new
tuskegee,
inside
old
tuskegee
now
receive
to
an
extent
not
shown
by
this
record
but
--
which
has
been
illuminated
by
counsel.
by
now
receiving
municipal
services
of
a
sort
from
the
city,
the
point
is
of
course
that
while
they
receive
these
services
to
some
degree
and
extent
not
shown.
they
are
no
longer
in
the
position
that
they
were
before
act
140
of
being
able
to
assert
through
the
exercise
the
franchise
and
through
the
exercise
of
less
formal
ways
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
of
their
rights.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
that's
title
37.
mr.
philip
elman
i
believe
it's
been
in
effect
for
--
considerable
period
of
time.
i
founded
in
the
1958
revision.
mr.
philip
elman
title
9
--
title
37
section
9
according
to
the
--
i'm
afraid
that
unlike
the
u.s.
code
annotated,
this
does
not
show
the
historical
deprecation,
so
i
cannot
answer
it.
mr.
philip
elman
well
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i'm
qualified
to
answer
that
question
mr.
chief
justice.so
far
as
statute
show,
the
--
the
police
jurisdiction
extends
to
this
area.
now,
the
extent
to
which
that
imposes
affirmative
responsibilities
upon
the
municipality,
i
cannot
ascertain
from
the
statutes.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
well
so
far
as
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
our
--
our
concern
to
the
extent
they
shed
line
on
this
and
they
must
be
taken
as
true.
the
allegation
is
that
the
petitioners
no
longer
receive
the
police
patrols
at
--
at
school
crossings.
they
use
to
have
that,
they
don't
have
that
now.
now,
as
residence
of
the
city,
of
course
they
would
be
in
a
position
to
complain
about
that
as
constituents
of
a
city
counsel
and
there
are
electors
in
there
and
so
on.
that
right
they
no
longer
have
and
that
of
course
is
in
a
context
to
this
case
an
important
consideration.
mr.
philip
elman
again,
so
far
as
the
statute
show
if
there
are
street
construction
--
new
--
new
construction,
new
road
and
so
on,
i
think
that
there
is
a
power
to
make
assessments
but
so
far
as
ad
valorem
--
mr.
philip
elman
if
--
if
i
--
if
i
speak
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
if
i
speak
erroneously
here
sir
--
mr.
philip
elman
it
is
only
because
of
as
a
non-alabama
lawyer,
i'm
not
sufficient
--
i'm
not
sufficiently
at
home
with
the
statute,
but
i
--
i've
made
an
effort
to
look
through
the
code
on
this.
there
is
a
provision
that
where
there
is
new
--
new
streets
are
laid,
they
can
--
there's
power
to
asses
within
the
police
jurisdiction.
but
i'm
--
i'm
sure
that
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
counsel
for
the
--
for
the
respondents,
are
in
far
better
position
to
respond
than
i
am.
but
i
--
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
go
to
the
heart
of
the
case
as
--
as
we
think
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
have
exposed
it.
the
complaint
in
this
case
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
your
honors
i
do
not
have
before
you
proof,
you
do
not
--
you're
not
called
upon
to
decide
what
the
relief
should
be
if
that
proof
should
be
accepted
in
the
judgment
of
violation
of
constitutional
rights
may.
the
only
question,
which
has
been
considered
--
below,
only
question,
which
is
here
is
the
question
stated
by
judge
brown.
whether
the
federal
courts
are
open
to
hear
and
determine
the
serious
charges
that
are
made
by
this
complaint,
the
charge
that
this
act
of
the
state
legislature,
although
cast
in
neutral
surveyors
terms
and
terms
of
metes
and
bounds
that
the
line
which
this
statute
draws
is
a
line
based
upon
race
or
color
and
that
it
deprives
these
petitioners
of
basic
constitutional
rights
secured
in
them
by
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments.
now,
the
court
--
both
courts
below
answered
that
question
in
the
negative,
said
that
it
is
not
the
business
of
the
federal
courts
to
entertain
and
resolve
the
controversy,
the
dispute,
which
is
created
by
these
allegations,
which
are
purposes
of
this
review,
i
can
take
this
is
true.
and
that
disposition
of
the
case
was
not
based
upon
cynicism
or
indifference.
the
courts
below
in
saying
to
the
petitioners
that
your
remedy
is
not
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
your
remedy
is
--
is
to
be
found
in
the
alabama
state
legislature,
which
you
say
is
the
body
which
has
denied
you
--
your
constitutional
rights.
as
the
opinions
below
demonstrate,
this
case
has
received
in
most
careful
and
thoughtful
consideration.
and
the
decision
below
is
based
essentially
upon
three
grounds,
one,
as
to
the
nature
of
the
statute
here.
this
was
a
statute
which
defined
municipal
boundaries
and
at
such
a
statute,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
three
cases,
such
statute
may
be
enacted
by
a
state
legislature
wholly
unrestrained
by
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
a
legislature
in
drawing
municipal
boundaries
and
extract
it
--
and
expanding
them
or
contracting
them
as
the
case
may
be
acts
entirely
as
it
pleases.
the
second
ground
is
that
this
--
this
law
on
its
face
has
not
a
word
on
--
on
race
and
color.
it's
neutral.
and
the
absence
of
an
expressed
discrimination
on
race
and
color
makes
it
wholly
improper
for
the
courts
to
inquire
into
the
motives
of
the
individual
legislators.
that
was
the
second
ground.
the
third
ground
as
--
was
as
to
the
inability
of
the
federal
courts
to
grant
relief
or
the
impropriety
of
granting
relief,
assuming
effective
relief
could
be
given.
now,
i
hope
to
deal
with
each
of
these
grounds,
but
i
think
the
hypothetical
case
of
mr.
justice
black
has
put
may
illustrate
the
government's
position
on
this.
i
think
--
we
think
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
serves
as
a
complete
obstacle
to
the
establishment
by
law
in
america
of
any
racial
or
religious
ghettos.
if
they
state
the
union
were
to
embark
openly
or
validly
without
any
pretense
on
the
policy
of
geographical
separation
of
the
racist
into
separate
communities,
a
policy
which
is
sometimes
described
as
the
policy
of
apartheid.
if
a
state
were
to
embark
that,
on
that
policy,
who
were
to
declare
that
--
as
a
matter
of
policy
to
avoid
hostility
between
the
races,
to
reduce
racial
tensions,
the
state
considers
it
desirable,
that
people
of
different
races
live
in
separate
communities.
that
within
each
community,
they
will
have
full
rights,
full
voting
rights,
full
rights
to
municipal
services,
but
they
shall
have
a
mayor
of
their
own
race,
they
shall
have
a
city
counsel
of
their
own
race,
they
shall
have
judges
of
their
own
race,
jurors
of
their
own
race.
if
in
short,
the
state
of
alabama,
instead
of
drawing
a
line
here,
which
it
has
had
created
two
communities,
white
tuskegee,
black
tuskegee.
we
do
not
think
this
court
would
consider
a
sufficient
defense
in
such
legislation,
that
the
people
who
left
in
black
tuskegee
had
full
voting
rights
or
had
just
as
good
police
or
better
police,
or
fire
protection,
or
health
protection,
or
if
their
garbage
was
being
picked
up
with
as
much
frequency
as
the
people
in
white
tuskegee.
it
seems
to
us
that
in
october
of
1960,
that
kind
of
defense
of
--
of
a
--
at
a
--
of
a
law
establishing
a
ghetto
in
the
united
states
need
--
need
not
--
cannot
be
asserted
in
this
court.
now,
the
first
ground
of
the
decision
below
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
i
--
i
--
in
this
respect,
the
united
states
does
not
agree
with
petitioners.
the
petitioners
have
assumed
a
burden,
which
we
do
not
--
do
not
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
construing
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
applied
to
racial
discriminations
requires
them
(inaudible).
the
petitioners
need
only
show
that
this
legislation,
although
cast
in
terms
which
do
not
reflect
race
and
color
is
in
substance
and
effect
a
racial
discrimination.
they
need
not
show
that
the
purpose
of
the
legislature
was
good
or
bad,
that
the
motives
were
--
were
worthy
or
unworthy.
this
court
in
cases
going
back
to
fletcher
against
peck
has
rejected
that
line
of
inquiry.
as
you
said
in
--
in
the
--
chief
justice
said,
for
example,
norris
against
alabama,
chief
justice
vinson
in
the
oyama
case.
the
inquiry
is
not
whether
a
--
a
constitutional
rights
have
been
denied
in
expressed
terms.
the
question
is
whether
they
have
been
denied
in
substance
and
effect.
and
in
the
jury
cases
for
example,
your
--
your
honors
have
frequently
heard
arguments
that
the
--
that
the
commissioner
who
puts
his
hand
in
the
box,
which
has
yellow
slips
for
negroes
and
white
slips
for
--
for
white
people,
he
--
he
has
testified
without
contradiction
that
the
farthest
thing
from
his
mind
was
race.
his
purposes,
his
--
his
motives
were
--
were
wholly
admirable.
he
was
not
thinking
of
race
at
all,
and
this
court
has
said
that
it
would
have
to
be
a
--
the
blindness
of
indifference
rather
than
the
blindness
of
impartiality,
which
would
attribute
to
a
systematic
result,
such
as
the
exclusion
of
negroes
from
juries
over
a
large
period
of
time,
whether
the
exclusion
was
total
or
not.
it
would
have
to
be
compressive
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
are
saying
--
mr.
philip
elman
we
are
saying
that
any
law
which
if
you
look
to
the
reality
rather
than
the
appearance,
if
you
look
to
what
it
is
and
what
it
does
rather
to
what
it
says.
if
that
law
in
actuality
draws
a
racial
line,
that
is
sufficient
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
establish
its
invalidity
regardless
of
what
may
have
been
in
the
minds
of
the
particular
officials
of
the
government
who
were
concerned
with
the
drawing
of
that
line.
that
is
our
position.
we
think
it's
the
position
that
this
court
has
--
excuse
me
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
elman
the
question
is
--
isn't
whether
there
are
prohibitions
as
to
a
--
or
burdens
on
the
negroes.
the
question
is
whether
this
statute
draws
a
racial
line.
if
it
draws
a
racial
line,
we
would
think
it
--
it
is
immaterial,
whether
they
a
--
the
result
of
the
--
of
the
drawing
of
that
racial
line
may
result
in
--
in
burdens
or
not.
mr.
philip
elman
class
legislation,
if
i
may
continue,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
class
legislation
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color,
we
think,
has
been
barred
by
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
it's
been
construed
by
this
court
from
cases
starting
with
the
slaughter-house
cases
and
started
in
west
virginia
going
through
the
line
of
cases
exemplified
by
brown
against
board
of
education.
if
people
live
in
a
ghetto,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
the
houses
in
the
ghetto
were
finer
than
the
houses
on
the
outside.
the
point
is
you
cannot
in
this
country
enact
legislation,
which
is
--
which
contains
a
racial
class
--
classification.
now,
in
others
--
other
areas,
classifications
between
farmers
and
working
men
for
example
or
other,
in
tax
legislation
hearing
--
that
this
court
is
always
faced
with
the
--
the
problem
of
--
of
scrutinizing
classifications
and
the
classic
formulation
of
the
scope
of
your
inquiry
is
--
is
there
are
rational
basis
for
such
classification.
but
when
it
comes
to
race
and
color,
you
don't
--
you
are
spared
to
that
problem
because
the
constitution
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
have
declared
that
race
or
color
is
an
impermissible
basis
of
classification.
mr.
philip
elman
no,
sir.
the
answer
is
no,
but
we
think
it
is
immaterial
because
if
the
statute
in
express
terms
declared
that
the
city
of
tuskegee
shall
be
redistricted
or
redraw
--
its
boundary
shall
be
redrawn
in
such
a
way
that
as
many
negroes
is
possible
shall
be
removed
from
it.
if
that
duty
were
entrusted
to
an
administrative
officer
or
a
city
surveyor,
that
--
that
would
--
i
am
very
confident
to
present,
no
problems
to
this
court
or
of
any
court
of
the
united
states.
mr.
philip
elman
exactly.
supposed
--
supposed
for
example,
i
--
i
may
be
restrained
from
the
issue
here,
but
supposed
for
example,
a
--
a
municipality
were
bent
upon
avoiding
the
consequences
of
--
of
brown
against
board
of
education
and
it
redrew
a
school
--
this
school
attendance
districts
in
terms
of
the
existing
residential
pattern.
now,
surely,
the
fact
that
a
child
--
a
--
parents
of
a
negro
child
wanted
to
attend
some
other
school
would
have
the
right
to
sell
their
--
their
house
and
try
to
find
their
house
in
a
--
in
another
neighborhood.
even
if
that
right
were
expressly
recognized
by
the
--
by
the
statute,
it's
hard
to
see
that
that
would
constitute
the
kind
of
constitutional
justification
for
violation
of
rights,
which
this
court
has
said
light
of
very
base
of
government.
we're
dealing
--
the
courts
everyday
in
a
week
or
ascertaining
the
intent
of
the
legislature,
they're
looking
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
they're
piercing
corporate
veils,
they
look
to
substance
and
not
to
form,
they're
doing
it
in
the
context
of
a
corporate
reorganization
cases.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
case
where
people
are
coming
into
the
court
and
saying,
"we
are
being
deprived
of
our
most
fundamental
rights.
we
are
being
deprived
of
these
rights
because
of
our
color."
and
if
a
court
--
mr.
philip
elman
my
argument
--
mr.
philip
elman
my
argument
would
be
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
argument
that
i'm
presenting
on
behalf
of
the
government
is
not
in
any
way
implied
that
the
federal
court
will
be
redrawing
municipal
boundaries
or
redrawing
some
of
the
school
attendance
district.
the
question
here
is
whether
the
federal
judicial
power
is
available
to
consider
and
adjudicate
a
claim
that
a
particular
action,
particular
governmental
action,
these
instances,
state
law.
mr.
philip
elman
is
--
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution
for
this?
mr.
philip
elman
if
it
is
--
if
it
is,
the
question
is
whether
a
declaratory
judgment
will
suffice
should
the
court
go
further
and
enter
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
law,
which
is
declared
not
invalid,
should
allow
a
reasonable
period
for
the
state
legislature
to
attempt
to
enact
other
lot.
all
those
questions
are
going
to
be
presented
when
the
district
court,
if
he
reaches
it,
has
to
decide
what
kind
of
relief
should
be
granted,
but
they're
not
here.
the
question
here
is,
whether
this
complaint
should
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
for
lack
of
judicial
power
to
consider
it.
that's
the
question.
and
unless
you
are
--
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
nothing
at
all
that
any
court
can
give
by
way
of
relief,
then
i
think,
the
question
of
relief
would
be
come
relevant
here.
and
i
don't
think
that
it
can
they
assume
as
it
was
in
one
of
the
opinions
--
the
opinion
of
judge
wisdom
below
that,
"no
court
can
grant
effective
relief
here
because
the
day
after
it's
a
decision
in
validating
this
law,
the
legislature
of
alabama
may
enact
a
new
law
with
slightly
different
variation
and
there
will
be
new
litigation
and
--
and
there
might
be
an
endless
series
of
--
of
lawsuits.
well,
certainly,
the
--
the
premise
that
a
legislature
of
a
state,
the
united
states
is
--
is
not
going
to
respect
the
determination
of
the
court.
the
language
is
charged
with
the
duty
of
determining
what
the
constitution
means
and
then
it's
--
it
is
--
and
you
--
you
assume
that
it's
--
it's
going
to
--
its
purpose
will
be
to
flout
in
every
conceivable
way
that
determination.
i
don't'
think
that
premise
can
be
asserted
or
accepted
by
this
court.
mr.
philip
elman
i
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
philip
elman
then,
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
philip
elman
no,
the
school
district
case
i
--
i
suggested
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
presented
the
case
of
--
of
a
specific
action
withdrawn
on
a
base
of
race
or
color
not
an
existing
--
an
existing
fact
in
which
--
mr.
philip
elman
well,
it's
--
it's
hard
offhand
for
me
to
--
to
think
of
an
existing
fact
being
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
--
i
have
to
find
some
governmental
action
which
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
what
did
the
state
do?
and
here,
the
state
did
something.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
and
if
it's
drawn
even
though
in
terms
--
without
regard
to
race
or
color,
if
it
is
in
substance
and
effect
a
racial
line,
we
think
the
constitution
permits
you
to
at
least
consider
an
allegation
along
those
lines.
now,
this
isn't
particularly
unique
in
the
field
of
racial
discrimination.
your
--
your
honors
have
had
the
cases
like
the
gross
gene
case
coming
from
louisiana,
and
the
facts
on
the
newspaper
advertising,
held
unconstitutional,
is
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
not
a
word
in
that
statute
about
interfering
with
freedom
of
the
press.
the
court
held
that
that
statute
burdened
the
exercise
of
the
constitutional
right
of
the
--
of
the
free
press.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
federal
court
should
have
made
an
inquiry
into
the
motives
of
the
members
of
the
new
orleans
--
of
the
louisiana
legislature
as
to
whether
they
intended
to
burden
the
press.
your
honors
look
at
the
operative
effects
of
this
legislation.
you
look
to
what
it
did,
not
to
what
it
said,
not
to
the
image
of
the
statute,
but
to
the
reality.
now
--
mr.
philip
elman
the
state
is
claiming
more,
sir.
mr.
philip
elman
they're
claiming
that
you
have
no
right
to
inquire
--
mr.
philip
elman
--
in
their
--
in
constitutionality
of
that
statute
because
it
is
a
statute
redrawing
the
boundaries.
mr.
philip
elman
yes,
sir.
in
this
case
--
that
in
this
case,
there
was
a
fifteenth
amendment
argument
which
on
the
allegation
of
the
complaint,
is
a
--
is
we
think
a
perfectly
valid
argument.
prior
to
this
act,
these
people
did,
these
petitioners
had
the
right
to
vote
in
municipal
elections.
now,
that
right
could've
been
taken
away
from
them
by
a
valid
law
redefining
the
boundaries.
they
had
no
vested
right
to
live
in
tuskegee,
obviously.
but
they
did
have
a
right
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
not
to
have
their
voting
rights
taken
away
because
of
their
color.
it
could've
been
taken
away
for
other
reasons,
but
not
for
that
reason.
mr.
philip
elman
i
think
mr.
--
mr.
philip
elman
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
black,
the
question
of
proof
of
course,
technically
speaking,
is
--
is
not
clearly
here.
mr.
philip
elman
it
actually
it
is.
and
now,
i
will
not
dock
the
question
on
that
ground.
so
far
as
what
kind
of
proof
is
concerned,
it
--
why
should
the
petitioners
in
this
kind
of
a
case
had
a
greater
burden
than
was
put
upon
the
plaintiff
in
--
in
the
--
in
the
case
for
example,
in
the
united
states
last
year
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
thomas
where
--
the
voting
case,
where
judge
wright
found
that
there
challenges
to
1377
negro
voters
and
only
to
10
white
voters
and
he
said,
"as
a
matter
of
statistics,
just
looking
at
the
numbers,
somehow
or
other,
the
negroes
were
challenged
and
the
whites
weren't."
and
from
that
i
infer
that
this
was
a
racial
action.
now,
we
think
that
in
this
case
that
--
that
the
maps,
the
population
in
themselves,
are
--
should
establish
a
prima
facie
case.
it's
--
it's
enough
to
shift
the
burden
of
going
forward
to
the
state.
if
the
state
--
if
there's
--
if
there
is
a
rational
justification
for
this
other
than
race
or
color,
surely,
the
state
can
--
can
come
forward
with
it
and
should
be
compelled
to
come
forward.
and
--
and
in
cases
for
example,
like
the
bates
case,
it
was
before
you
last
year,
you
--
your
honors
have
said,
on
the
face
of
it,
we
see
no
discernible
justification
for
this
--
if
this
there
is
that
the--
the
navels
is
sustained.
if
it
can
be
met,
if
there
is
such
a
discernible
justification
that
we
don't
know
about,
let's
hear
from
the
state.
mr.
philip
elman
well,
judge
wisdom
in
his
opinion
below,
his
conquering
opinion
below
held
that
this
complaint
had
to
fail
because
it
required
an
inquiry
into
motives.
he
used
the
word,
'motives,'
motives
of
the
legislators.
he
referred
to
psychoanalysis
of
the
members
of
the
legislature,
prying
into
the
subconscious
motive.
now,
we
--
we
think
that
that
poses
this
--
this
puts
up
a
strong
end.
no
one
suggests
when
--
when
a
court
is
seeking
in
to
ascertain
the
meaning
of
legislation
or
the,
"intent"
of
the
legislature,
that
you
take
affidavits
from
the
--
you
subpoena
the
members
of
the
legislature
and
ask
them,
"oh,
just
what
did
you
have
in
mind
when
you
voted
for
this
or
when
you
voted
against
it?"
that's
not
--
that's
not
the
process
of
judicial
inquiry
into
the
meaning
of
legislation.
and
we
think
that's
--
that's
all
that
you
have
to
do.
mr.
philip
elman
if
you
can
see
that,
if
you
can
see
that,
then
it's
forbidden.
if
it's
done
there
because
they
are
colored
and
--
mr.
philip
elman
and
you
don't
look
to
the
statute,
but
--
mr.
philip
elman
that's
right.
