the
--
mr.
carter,
becoming
nonresidents
of
the
municipality
of
tuskegee
did
not,
in
anyway,
impair
the
right
of
the
400
former
voters
in
tuskegee
to
vote
in
all
other
state
and
county
elections.
justice

you
did
not
impair.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
municipality.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
the
registrars
are
county
officials,
are
they
not?
so
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
so
that
living
in
tuskegee
doesn't
give
you,
as
a
practical
matter,
more
of
a
chance
to
become
eligible
to
vote.
you
don't
go
before
different
registrars
wherein
they
would
--
justice

both
residents
and
nonresidents
of
the
city.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
fact
that
based
on
alabama
law,
the
--
this
--
this
act
was
perfectly
proper
and
valid.
justice
potter
stewart
in
terms
of
the
power
of
legislature
(inaudible).
justice

(voice

--
justice
potter

i
see.
justice

district
court
called
it
a
sea
dragon,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
conversely
mr.
carter,
are
there
any
white
people
who
are
now
resident
of
the
county
because
of
this
reduction
in
the
area
of
the
municipality
who
used
to
be
residents
in
the
city
but
were
not
voters?
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
this
thought
in
mind,
the
city
as
it
used
to
be
before
the
enactment
of
this
one
party,
the
statute
was
what,
five,
six
negro,
was
it
not,
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
five
to
one.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
any
reduction
in
size
of
the
city,
presumably
on
the
--
on
averages
which
would
put
five
negroes
into
the
outside
of
the
city
to
everyone,
white
person,
that
is
any
--
just
that
passer
reduction
in
the
size
of
the
city?
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
it,
because
just
perhaps
statistically
it's
not
too
big
example
or
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
other
reason.
but
if
you
simply
reduced
the
size
of
the
rectangle
let
me
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
instead
of
creating
a
sea
dragon,
you
made
a
smaller
rectangle.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
that
it
--
at
least
the
ratio
of
five
to
one,
people
who
are
then
in
a
county
would
prevail.
and
as
i
say
at
least
because
you
just
told
us
that
there
are
more
negroes
on
the
periphery
in
the
rectangle
--
of
the
old
rectangle.
justice
potter
stewart
not
at
all
of
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
white
people,
whether
or
not
they
are
voters.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
carter,
before
you
proceed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
what's
the
meaning
of
this
extraterritorial
police
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
a
police
power
to
arrest
or
is
it
a
--
is
it
a
day-to-day
police
protection
from
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
they
pay
--
of
course,
as
i
assume
they
pay
for
the
water.
justice
potter
stewart
by
health
services,
you
mean
what,
garbage
collection?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
never
been
a
part
of
the
city.
