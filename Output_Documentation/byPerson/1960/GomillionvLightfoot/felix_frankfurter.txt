justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
how
long
the
old
limit
were
had
been
in
existence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
tuskegee
institute
on
that
map?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
now
outside.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
where
the
--
this
is
just
geographic,
historical
interest,
when
was
the
institute
founded
by?
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
early
as
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
did
(inaudible)
washington
gets
there?
do
you
have
any
idea?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
there
about
the
turn
of
the
century,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
name
of
the
county,
mr.
gray?
justice
felix
frankfurter
macon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
--
what's
the
--
what
was
the
population
within
the
old
boundaries
and
what
is
--
in
the
present
boundaries?
justice
felix
frankfurter
state
those
figures
again,
please,
mr.
gray.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
of
two
questions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
there
were
400
qualified
voters.
do
we
--
i
mean
they're
on
the
registry
but
couldn't
vote.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
that
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
do
they
actually
--
they
actually
exercise
a
franchise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
for
state
or
county
or
city
elections
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
did
the
--
did
the
old
tuskegee
or
the
--
or
the
government
one
of
who
are
mayor
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
those
were
subject
to
election.
they
were
--
they
were
elected
officials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
have
a
county
commissioners
or
whatever
they
call
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
all
so
popularly
elected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
--
within
the
new
boundaries,
are
those
--
the
negroes
that
are
now
contained
within
the
new
boundaries,
they
--
they
have
the
right
to
vote
for
--
for
county,
as
i
suppose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
--
of
course,
shed
out
from
any
relations
to
the
government
of
what
is
now
the
city
of
tuskegee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
may
i
ask
you
this.
that
situation
was
it
--
has
been
at
all
affected
or
is
entirely
affected
by
this
attempted
redistricting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
a
part
of
--
i
understand
that.
so
you've
said
a
little
while
ago.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
there
is
any
relation
between
the
thing
you
last
said
as
for
the
disproportioned
negro
representation
among
the
registered
and
so
on?
is
that
at
all
affected?
is
that
result
influence
by
or
affected
by
this
redistricting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
--
for
reason
unrelated
with
the
logistic?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
applies
also
to
police.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
must
have
been
that
the
police
authority
extended
beyond
the
old
limits
of
the
city
of
tuskegee,
must
have
been
through
some
other
alabama
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
even
its
three
miles
since
there's
a
--
there's
a
contraction,
the
three
miles
wouldn't
radiate
so
far
as
it
did
previously.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
indicate
where
a
mile
and
a
half
is
on
your
map
from
that
point.
from
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
from
where
you
first
started
with
your
point,
from
there,
that's
right.
i
indicate
on
that
map
how
far
a
mile
and
a
half
to
take
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
2
inches
and
800
feet.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
prima
facie
case
(inaudible)
isn't
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
initiate
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry,
mr.
carter,
i
don't
hear
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
begin
the
proof,
you
would
offer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
get
--
you
didn't
have,
mr.
gray,
you
didn't
have
the
exact
number
of
negroes
that
were
left
in
the
redistricting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
there
are
a
few
hundreds,
does
that
mean
200
or
800?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
clustered
in
some
particular
place
on
that
map?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
area?
is
that
a
--
what
kind
of
an
area
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
be
grossly
settled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
in
the
center
of
the
city,
mr.
carter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
suppose
i
go
on
with
justice
black's
hypothetical
case,
an
existing
county
happens
to
natural
coagulation,
to
a
natural
aggregation
to
have
predominantly
in
one
half
of
it
white,
said
reduced
and
then
in
the
other
half,
colored
city
and
the
state
then
splits
it
into
half
but
each
half
continues
to
have
voting
right.
nothing
is
done
to
--
to
takeaway
the
--
either
directly
or
to
any
manipulating
of
the
electoral
machinery,
to
potentiality
or
the
opportunity
for
the
exercise
of
the
franchise.
what
will
you
do
with
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
forbidden
by
what,
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
you
have
a
county
that
divides
in
the
same
way
not
according
to
racial
line
but
according
to
economic
preoccupations
or
interests.
half
of
it
happens
to
be
industrial
and
the
other
half
is
agricultural
and
the
same
division
has
been
made.
what
do
you
do
with
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
here,
you
--
you
argue
yesterday
that
you
haven't
got
a
kind
of
admixture
here
because
the
redistricting
throws
out
practically
every,
theretofore,
qualified
negro
voters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
yesterday,
how
many
were
left?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
three
or
four
and
all
of
the
400
that
are
--
if
all
of
them
with
--
with
negligibly
exceptions
were
recalled
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
consequences
that
the
chief
justice
indicated
yesterday
in
his
first
(inaudible)
but
they
haven't
got
fire
protection
if
they
haven't
got
--
they've
got
a
shrinking
of
police
protection
if
any
and
all
the
other
amenities
of
a
municipal
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
got
a
heavier
burden,
have
you
got
a
heavier
burden
in
this
case
than
the
offer
of
truth
that
your
allegations
(inaudible)
under
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
without
making
the
generalization
in
a
figure,
namely
that
there
were
400
qualified
negro
voters
and
a
redistricting
took
all
the
400
out
with
reference
to
the
enjoyment
they,
theretofore,
had
in
the
city
of
tuskegee.
have
you
got
a
greater
burden
in
that,
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
of
course,
if
there's
an
unconstitutional
deprivation,
there's
an
unconstitutional
deprivation,
but
the
fact
may
determine
that
there
isn't
an
unconstitutional
deprivation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
thought
the
state
here
that
the
--
the
mitigation
derived
from
the
fact
the
state
doesn't
affect
everything
you
say
so,
the
external
fact,
i
mean
disability,
and
there
is
no
explanation
for
this
other
than
the
fact
that
having
done
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
in
the
old
fashion
language,
they
demurrer
for
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
we
have
here
a
clear
case
of
the
demurrer
for
the
facts
which
you're
ready
to
prove,
so
you
don't
have
to
prove
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
though
the
statute
had
to
provide
though,
however,
if
they
can,
they
may
buy
new
houses
and
new
bag.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
do
not
have
to
work
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
it's
the
biennial
legislature,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
a
little
ahead
of
the
game.
so
that
if
this
statute,
if
140
is
invalidated
and
the
old
boundary
revert,
unless
there's
a
special
session
of
the
legislature
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
take
some
time
to
do
what
judge
wisdom
feels
it
might
be
done,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
take
in
what
you've
just
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
carter,
what
were
the
exact
issues
in
anyone
of
those
three
cases,
take
hunter
against
pittsburgh
or
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
exactly
was
done
that
was
complained
off?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
a
general
language
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
was
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
suppose
we'll
step
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
complained
of
what?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
complained
--
he
complained
and
he
was
quite
happy
when
he
was
outside
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pittsburgh
and
now
he's
in
the
inside
of
pittsburgh
and
the
tax
rate
is
going
to
be
higher.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
that
was
involved
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
fundamentally,
they
involved
complaint
by
citizens
of
a
smaller
unit,
it
would
a
next
to
a
bigger
city
or
vice
versa
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
big
city
having
been
struck
down
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
they
involved
the
relation
of
the
municipality
to
the
state.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
them
having
been
originally
created
and
their
boundaries
having
been
declined
by
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
analog
would
be
some
neighboring
little
village
had
been
next
to
tuskegee
or
a
division
has
been
made
of
which
your,
such,
calculation
regarding
the
population
distribution
could
be
made
as
it's
made
in
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
we
agree
if
you
have
language?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
really
resting,
are
you
not
mr.
carter
on
legal
(inaudible)
and
i
don't
mean
to
use
the
word,
derogatory.
but
you're
resting
on
a
legal
absence,
that
the
creation,
the
destruction,
and
modification
of
municipality,
is
the
political
functions
of
the
state
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
you
take
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
carter
your
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question,
makes
into
a
general
proposition
that
you
are
standing
on
an
absence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
the
legislature
of
alabama
said,
whereas
these
people
of
the
united
states
has
said
and
then
quoted
the
thing
you
quote
from
laramie
county,
from
beckwith,
from
hunter
and
pittsburgh.
therefore,
exercising
the
right
to
do
what
we
--
judicially
unreviewable
power
to
do
namely
three
district
municipality,
we
redistrict
it
because
for
the
wellbeing
of
the
state,
i
mean
they
could
for
colored
people
to
flock
together,
for
white
folks
to
flock
together.
if
that
is
bad,
as
i
understand
you
to
say
that
would
be
bad?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
because
i
don't
believe
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
talking
about
whether
you
can't
say
those
appropriately
quoted
things
from
those
three
cases
are
some
of
the
generalities,
unqualified
generality,
which
court
give
expression
to
in
deciding
a
concrete
case
that
can
stand
scrutiny
when
a
different
case
arises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
very
well,
i
can
understand
that.
