mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
an
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
setting
aside
an
order
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
the
order
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
continued,
in
effect,
a
provisional
construction
permit
authorizing
the
other
petitioner,
power
reactor
development
corporation
to
construct
an
atomic
power
plant
outside
detroit,
michigan.
the
provisional
construction
permit
authorized
the
continuance
of
construction.
it
did
not
authorize
the
operation
of
the
reactor
which
could
not
be
done
until
there
had
been
a
further
proceeding
followed
by
the
issuance
of
a
license
to
operate.
the
court
below
set
aside
the
order
of
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
its
findings
concerning
safety
did
not
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
atomic
energy
act.
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court's
indulgence
to
postpone
any
further
discussion
of
the
issues
or
decision
below,
although
i
recognize
it's
unusual,
until
i
have
given
a
rather
lengthy
exposition
of
the
fact
because
i'm
convinced
that
the
issues
in
the
case
become
quite
clear
and
understandable
once
the
factual
situation
has
been
thoroughly
described.
and
i
do
assure
you
that
i
will
come
back
to
them
later.
all
atomic
reactors
rest
upon
the
fact
that
there
are
some
atoms,
chiefly
in
uranium,
which
can
be
split
into
smaller
particles.
the
nucleus
of
an
atom
is
made
up
of
protons
and
neutrons,
smaller
particles.
in
uranium,
the
protons
and
neutrons
usually
total
238,
but
there's
a
very
small
proportion
in
which
the
protons
and
neutrons
add
up
to
only
235.
and
u-235,
as
it
is
called,
has
the
capacity
to
split
apart
when
it
is
struck
by
another
free
neutron,
so
that
if
you
had
one
atom
of
u-235,
getting
struck
by
one
free
neutron,
you
would
then
have
three
results
that
are
significant
here.
first,
you
would
have
the
release
of
energy,
chiefly
energy
in
the
form
of
flying
fragments,
the
kinetic
energy,
which,
when
they
bumped
into
each
other
and
bumped
into
other
substances
around,
would
be
transformed
into
heat.
and
the
function
of
this
reactor
is
to
capture
that
energy
in
the
form
of
heat,
turn
it
into
steam
and
then
use
the
steam
to
generate
electricity
which
is
fed
into
or
will
be
fed,
in
time,
into
a
normal
utility
grid.
the
second
consequence
of
the
fission
is
radioactive
waste,
the
particles
that
are
left.
and
they
are,
for
a
time
highly,
dangerous
to
man
or
other
forms
of
life
and
one
of
the
problems,
in
building
an
atomic
reactor,
is
to
make
sure
that
none
of
that
radioactive
waste,
either
at
normal
operation
or
as
a
consequence
of
any
abnormal
accident,
will
escape.
the
third
consequence
of
a
fission
is
the
release
of
free
neutrons.
now,
if
you
had
100
fissions,
to
take
a
small
number,
actually,
we're
dealing
with
billions,
if
you
had
100
fissions
and
then
they
release
just
enough
free
neutrons
to
cause
another
100
fissions
as
they
struck
atoms
of
u-235,
obviously,
you'd
have
a
self-sustaining
chain
reaction.
if
you
had
only
95
out
of
100
in
each
generation,
cause
another
fission,
then
the
reaction
would
not
be
self-sustaining,
it
would
run
down.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
had
105,
which
would
be
terribly
fast
increase,
you
would
have
the
number
of
fissions,
multiply
itself
many
times
over
in
a
very
small
period
of
time.
the
problem
of
the
early
atomic
scientist
was
to
achieve
the
self-sustaining
chain
reaction.
the
problem
of
the
man
building
an
atomic
power
reactor
is
to
control
the
free
neutrons
in
such
a
way
that
he
can
raise
the
level
up
to
the
level
at
which
he
wants
it
to
operate
and
then
hold
it
there,
operating
it
just
each
generation
of
neutrons
reproducing
itself
or
to
take
it
down
later
if
he
wishes
to
take
it
down.
this
is
done
chiefly
by
controlling
the
freight
of
the
free
neutrons.
the
various
ways
of
doing
that,
one,
is
obviously
to
increase
the
number
of
u-235
atoms
in
your
fuel
because
if
you
have
more
u-235
atoms,
the
chance
that
a
free
neutron
will
strike
one
in
such
a
way
to
cause
fission
increases.
equally,
if
you
increase
the
amount
of
fuel,
the
chance
that
a
free
neutron
will
strike
a
u-235
atom
before
it
escapes
from
the
fuel
and
becomes
irrelevant
is
obviously
going
to
increase.
and
just
the
amounts
of
fuel
which
will
sustai
--
create
a
self-sustaining
chain
reaction,
you
will
find
often
in
this
record,
called
the
critical
size
or
critical
mass.
another
way
of
controlling
the
fate
of
the
free
neutrons,
which
becomes
important
here,
is
to
put
into
the
fuel
something
that
will
capture
them
without
causing
a
fission.
for
example,
if
you
put
boron,
another
element,
into
the
fuel,
it
will
capture
the
free
neutrons,
so
they
can't
strike
other
atoms
and
reduce
or
bring
an
end
to
the
chain
reaction.
and
all
reactors
have
boron
control
rods,
so
that
you
can
--
by
inserting
it,
the
reaction
will
be
cut
down,
by
withdrawing
it,
you
can
permit
it
to
increase.
and
they
also
have,
as
i
will
show
a
little
later
with
this
model,
boron
safety
rods,
which
can
be
suddenly
inserted
in
the
event
of
any
mishap
in
order
to
shut
the
whole
thing
down.
at
the
present
time,
there
are
operating
in
the
united
states
some
115
reactors.
the
variant
size
from
small
experimental
reactors
to
large-scale
power
reactors
such
as
we
have
involved
in
this
case.
there
are
90
more
that
are
being
built.
two
of
the
large-scale
power
reactors
are
located
near
big
cities,
one
outside
chicago,
one
outside
detroit
and
there
are
others
near
smaller
cities
like
albany,
new
york.
most
of
the
large-scale
power
reactors
are
what
are
known
as
thermal
reactors
because
they
depend
for
the
reaction
on
slow
neutrons,
which
i'll
describe
in
a
minute,
rather
than
the
fast
neutrons
on
which
the
prdc
reactor
were
built,
it
will
depend.
one
of
the
characteristics
of
an
atom
of
u-235
is
that
for
some
reason,
it
splits
more
easily
when
it's
hit
by
a
neutron
going
slowly
than
when
it's
hit
by
a
neutron
going
fast.
so
what
scientist
does
is
to
put
into
the
reactor
in
and
around
the
fuel
something
called
a
moderator
that
will
slow
the
neutron
down
without
capturing
it
and
thereby
increase
the
number
of
fissions
that
takes
place
for
a
given
number
of
free
neutrons.
and
those
are
called
thermal
reactors.
the
prdc
reactor
will
not
slow
the
neutrons
down.
it's
therefore
less
efficient
in
achieving
fissions
than
a
thermal
reactor.
but
the
fast
neutrons
have
a
characteristic
that
slow
neutrons
don't
have.
the
fast
neutrons,
when
they
hit
u-238,
the
non-fissionable
uranium,
a
certain
proportion
of
them
turn
the
non-fissionable
uranium
into
plutonium.
and
plutonium
is
itself
a
fissionable
material.
the
result
is
that
a
fast
reactor
like
this
one
will
create
more
fissionable
material
than
it
burns.
one
of
the
witnesses
in
the
record
said
this
is
like
starting
off
an
automobile
trip
with
your
gasoline
tank
half
full,
driving
500
miles,
buying
no
gas
and
arriving
at
home
with
a
full
gasoline
tank.
the
trick,
of
course,
is
that
you
are
using
up
the
non-fissionable
u-238.
you
aren't
really
getting
something
for
nothing.
but
u-238
is
quite
plentiful
whereas
u-235
is
very
rare.
and
therefore,
as
the
commission
found
in
this
case,
the
successful
use
of
a
fast
breeder
reactor
would
be
a
great
step
forward
in
increasing
the
amount
of
atomic
fuel
and
therefore,
increasing
the
amount
of
potential
energy
in
the
world.
of
course,
the
great
importance
of
such
reactors
as
this
is
that
they
do
hold
out
a
great
hope
of
enabling
many
areas
in
the
world
that
don't
have
sources
of
energy
now
to
obtain
a
cheap
source
of
the
electric
energy
which
is
necessary
not
only
to
economic
well-being,
but
some
people
think
to
a
stable
political
society
because
such
communities
don't
have
hydroelectric
power
and
the
expense
of
shipping
in
oil
or
coal
would
be
very,
very
great
indeed.
and
of
course,
atomic
energy
is,
for
ourselves,
a
reserve
against
the
possible
loss
of
oil
or
coal,
both
of
which
are
being
consumed
that
is
very,
very
fast.
the
record
of
atomic
reactors,
the
safety
record
in
this
country,
seems
to
me
to
be
very
high,
indeed.
there
has
been
no
regularly
operating
reactor.
i
used
"regularly
operating"
to
exclude
those
being
used
to
perform
scientific
experiments.
there's
been
no
accident
with
the
regularly
operating
reactor
which
has
resulted
in
any
injury
to
anyone
leaving
aside
--
in
the
regularly
operating
ones.
even
counting
the
reactors
in
which
scientific
experiments
are
being
performed
outside
of
laboratories
which
don't
have
the
usual
facilities
of
a
reactor,
there
had,
until
january
1960,
been
no
accident
involving
either
a
fatality
to
anyone
or
an
injury
to
a
member
of
the
public.
unfortunately,
there
was
one
reactor
accident
in
idaho
in
1960
in
an
experimental
reactor
which
did
result
in
the
deaths
of
three
employees.
even
there,
however,
there
was
no
injury
to
any
member
of
the
public.
no
radioactive
waste
in
significant
quantities
was
found
outside
the
reactor
building
and
the
building
had
none
of
the
safeguards
which
would
be
associated
with
any
developmental
power
reactor
of
this
kind,
none
of
the
containment
to
keep
radioactive
waste
in.
the
proposed
prdc
reactor
will
be
located
at
laguna
beach
which
is
about
35
miles
from
the
center
of
detroit.
the
whole
plant,
of
course,
comprises
normal
generating
facilities,
boilers
and
other
things
of
that
kind.
but
i
have
here
an
--
a
model
of
the
reactor.
this
is
a
scale
of
about
7-to-1.
the
reactor
itself
will
be
60
--
65
inches
--
65
inches
high
and
this
is
about
a
foot
high.
and
it
will
be
80
inches
in
diameter.
in
fact,
it's
rarely
only
a
matrix
--
mr.
archibald
cox
can
everybody
see
it
there?
that's
--
oh,
that's
very
convenient
for
me.[laughs]
mr.
archibald
cox
the
reactor
is
really
a
matrix.
it
holds
in
place
a
large
number
of
separate
subassemblies,
these
are
all
removable.
and
this
--
the
whole
thing,
the
whole
cylinder
is
made
up
of
things
like
this,
separate
subassemblies.
the
core
section
where
the
atomic
reaction
takes
place
is
marked
in
blue.
and
the
rest
of
it
is
what's
known
as
the
"blanket".
mr.
archibald
cox
the
blanket.
mr.
archibald
cox
all
around
here.
this,
of
course,
is
cut
away.
now,
i
have
also
here
a
--
this
is
real
life.[laughs]
this
isn't
a
model.
this
is
a
section
of
one
of
the
subassemblies,
this
correspond
as
it
were
to
this,
to
the
blue
part
of
this.
this
is,
in
fact,
one
of
the
subassemblies
from
the
prdc
reactor.
they
hang
down,
you
see,
the
same
as
this
does
only
they're
locked
in.
the
subassembly,
the
outside,
is
simply
a
cover
of
stainless
steel.
inside
it
is
this
birdcage
or
honeycomb
construction.
it
holds
these
pins
which
are
removable.
you
can
see
them
along
the
front
here.
these
are
made
up
of
uranium.
these
are
steel
so
that
we
can
handle
them,
but
in
the
reactor,
they
will
be
made
up
of
uranium
which
has
27%,
the
fissionable
u-235.
and
the
whole
thing
is
filled
with
the
solid
pins.
then
this
honeycomb
or
birdcage
construction
holds
the
pins
rigidly
in
place,
for
a
reason
that
i
will
explain
a
little
later.
and
all
that
is
in,
when
it's
in
place,
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
see
the
inside.
it's
in
this
stainless
steel.
the
--
when
the
reaction
is
taken
--
no,
one
thing
more
i
should
explain
going
back
to
this.
what
i
had
there
corresponded
to
the
blue
of
a
single
one
of
these.
the
non-blue,
the
silver
part,
is
physically
very
similar
to
this.
but
instead
of
having
the
u-235
in
it,
the
pins
that
are
not
in
the
blue,
the
upper
and
lower
parts
here
and
the
outside
pin
are
made
up
of
uranium
that's
nearly
all
u-238,
and
it's
out
in
this
blanket
of
u-238
that
the
breeding
or
creation
of
plutonium
occurs.
now,
you
see
the
fast
neutron
will
--
some
of
them
will
go
out
of
the
core
without
causing
a
fission
and
then
they
will
be
captured
by
the
u-238
in
the
outer
section,
forming
plutonium,
which
is
later
a
byproduct
and
used
potentially
in
other
reactors.
over
the
reactor,
i'm
sorry,
there's
no
physical
way
of
i
--
to
show
it,
hang
two
control
rods
that
i
mentioned
earlier
made
of
boron
and
eight
safety
rods.
the
control
rods,
of
course,
are
operated
mechanically,
so
that
they
go
into
or
out
of
the
reactor
in
order
to
slow
down
or
speed
up
the
reaction.
the
boron
safety
rods
are
suspended
from
electromagnets.
and
then,
if
anything
approaching
a
mishap
occurs,
the
power
is
shut
off
and
they
drop
into
the
reactor
and
shut
the
reaction
down
so
that
the
mishaps
do
not
go
any
further.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
whole
--
the
whole
thing
is
65
inches
high
and
80
inches
in
diameter.
when
the
reactor
is
operating,
it
generates,
in
through
here,
large
quantities
of
heat.
to
carry
the
heat
away,
they're
boiled
up
through.
you
see,
it
could
go
all
through
these
birdcages
even
when
pins
are
in,
boils
through
sodium.
the
sodium
carries
the
heat
away,
at
one
purpose
it
serves,
the
other
is
that
through
a
series
of
heat
exchanges,
the
sodium
is
used
to
heat
water
and
the
water
is
turned
into
steam
and
is
used
to
turn
the
generators
that
make
the
electric
power.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
the
building
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
going
to
do
it.
i
might
just
well
do
it
now.
the
reactor
is
located
in
a
series
of
containment
vessels
which,
as
a
result
of
test,
can
be
said
to
be
such
that
they
would
contain
an
explosion
equivalent
to
1000
pounds
of
tnt.
first,
this
outer
part
here
is
two
inches
of
steel,
two
inches
apart
in
separate
lengths.
then
outside
of
that
is
three
feet
of
graphite
with
another
steel
tank
all
around
it.
then
there's
another
half
inch
of
steel
and
two
and
a
half
feet
of
concrete.
and
all
these,
everything
here
is
underground.
the
floor
over
this
is
five
feet
of
steel
and
concrete.
and
then
the
whole
thing
is
in
a
sort
of
a
football-shaped
building
with,
i
think,
its
two-inch
steel
shelf,
which
is
gas
tight
and
which
extends
down
again
below
the
ground
as
well
as
going
over
the
whole
thing.
this
is
built
so
that
if
by
any
chance
there
were
an
explosion
in
the
reactor,
equivalent
to
1000
pounds
of
tnt,
still,
none
of
the
radioactive
elements
can
get
out.
now,
let
me
say
now,
i'm
coming
to
the
matter
of
explosion
later,
that
the
very
maximum
explosion,
anybody
has
been
able
to
figure
out
that
happened,
even
if
you
made
the
serious
or
worst
assumption,
is
in
the
order
of
being
equivalent
to
600
or
700
pounds
of
tnt.
so
that
the
containment
is
--
allows
a
very
large
margin
over
the
worst
explosion
that
anybody
could
imagine
taking
place
in
a
building.
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
each
of
these
pins,
i'm
not
going
to
explain
the
mechanism
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
couldn't
to
be
honest,
each
of
these
pins,
if
we'll
leave
this
with
the
clerk,
you
examine
it,
is
built
so
that
fingers
can
come
around
and
take
it
at
the
very
end
just
as
i
do
and
pull
it
out.
and
this
is
built
so
that
all
the
fuel
elements,
this
is
one
of
the
safety
features
of
the
fast
reactor,
each
of
the
fuel
elements
will
be
removed
at
least
as
often
as
once
every
12
weeks.
this
keeps
down
the
amount
of
radioactive
waste
you
have
in
here.
they
are
then
removed
and
shipped
in
various
special
containers
to
the
atomic
energy
commission
which
stores,
or
if
it
has
occasion
to
use
it,
uses
the
plutonium.
you
see,
while
i
have
only
the
front
row
removable,
everything
in
here
is
removable
in
the
same
manner.
and
this
can
all
be
done
at
long
distance.
their
fingers
would
come
down
and
take
it
off.
they
put
in
water
for
a
time
and
then
carried
away.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
in
the
non-blue
part
in
the
axial
and
radial
blanket
as
they
call
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
taken
back
and
reprocessed
by
the
atomic
energy
commission.
none
of
the
processing
of
these
things
is
done
in
detroit
or
indeed
will
be
done
by
prdc.
it's
all
--
that's
all
government
does.
none
of
that
is
private.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
wanted
now
to
come
to
the
proceedings
before
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
then
in
illustrating
one
of
the
questions
before,
i
think
the
key
question
before
the
commission.
i'm
going
to
come
to
the
maximum
possible
explosion.
the
original
application
before
the
atomic
energy
commission
was
filed
on
january
6,
1956.
the
commission
referred
the
application
to
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safeguards
which
had
no
statutory
standing
at
the
time,
but
which
now
has
statutory
standing
under
the
act.
the
commission
made
a
report
on
the
proposed
reactor
which
was
non-committal
and
certainly
some
people
would
say
it
was
discouraging,
although
i
think
non-committal
is
the
more
accurate
word.
the
commission
then
had
the
staff
make
certain
further
studies
about
the
safety
of
the
reactor
and
in
august
1956,
the
commission
issued
a
provisional
construction
permit.
the
issuance
of
that
permit,
let
me
say
very
candidly,
gave
rise
to
a
great
deal
of
criticism,
both
because
it
was
issued
in
the
face
of
a
non-committal,
if
not
discouraging
acrs
report
because
that
report
had
not
been
published,
it
was
treated
as
an
executive
document,
and
because
no
hearings
had
been
held.
the
point
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
the
validity
of
the
original
construction
permit,
the
august
1956
permit,
is
not
before
the
court.
that's
not
the
order
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
the
order
which
is
here.
after
that
permit
was
issued,
the
acrs
report
was
released.
the
labor
unions,
who
are
respondents
in
this
court,
intervened.
there
were
very
long
and
detailed
hearings
at
which
most
of
the
members,
the
acrs
testified.
the
commission
made
findings,
heard
briefs
and
had
oral
argument
and
then
issued
the
order
which
is
before
this
court
for
review,
which
was
an
order,
making
certain
findings
and
continuing
the
construction
permit
in
effect.
so
in
our
view,
the
earlier
criticism
is
not
pertinent
at
all
to
the
later
phase
of
the
proceeding.
indeed,
if
you
read
the
criticisms
cited
in
respondent's
brief
with
any
care,
you
will
find
that
most
of
them
plainly
and
all
of
them,
i
think,
by
fair
inference,
applied
to
this
original
provisional
construction
permit
and
not
to
the
findings
which
were
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
are
here
for
review.
now,
when
the
original
prdc
application
was
filed,
it
was
not
complete
in
the
sense
that
it
contained
all
the
details
of
the
final
design
of
this
reactor
as
it
would
operate.
there's
nothing
unusual
about
that,
let
me
emphasize,
not
only
in
the
case
of
atomic
energy
but
in
the
case
of
all
kinds
of
research
and
development
today.
frequently,
science
--
scientist
can
project
a
solution
for
certain
problems
long
before
the
engineers
are
actually
able
to
build
something
to
test
the
basis
and
to
try
it
out
in
person.
and
it
also
is
a
fact,
which
i
think
any
engineer
or
scientist
would
agree
to
today,
that
frequently
in
the
course
of
construction,
you
are
able
to
solve
problems
that
couldn't
be
solved
until
the
construction
had
begun.
and
certainly,
you
are
able
to
make
test
that
could
not
be
made
until
the
construction
had
begun.
this
is
especially
familiar
in
the
atomic
energy
industry
and
the
commission
has
a
regulation
which
bares
directly
on
this
point
and
which
we
think
is
the
key
regulation
in
this
case.
it's
reg.50.35,
which
you
will
find
on
page
135
of
the
government's
main
brief.
it
says,
in
effect,
i
won't
read
it
all
because
it's
quite
long,
that
where
the
applicant
is
unable
to
furnish
full
technical
explanation,
nevertheless,
the
commission
may
issue
a
provisional
construction
permit.
if
the
commission
finds,
and
i
now
quote,
"that
it
--
right
from
the
middle
of
50.35,
"that
it
has
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
a
facility
of
the
general
type
proposed
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public."
but
then
the
latter
part
of
50.35
goes
on
and
says
"that
this
permit
and
the
issuance
of
an
eventual
license
to
operate
is
conditional
upon
the
very
end,
an
evaluation
by
the
commission
that
the
final
design
provides
reasonable
assurance
that
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public
will
not
be
endangered."
now,
there's
one
semantic
problem
that
i
want
to
come
straight
at
here.
you
will
note
that
the
part
i
read
first
speaks
of
a
facility
of
the
general
type
proposed
and
speaks
of
reasonable
assurance
that
a
facility
of
the
general
type
proposed
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location.
when
these
hearings
were
being
held
before
the
commission,
a
reference
to
the
prdc
reactor,
in
one
sense,
of
course,
was
a
reference
to
a
specific
thing.
it
was
something
at
laguna
beach
that
they
wanted
to
build
there
and
it
was
described
by
the
application.
in
another
sense,
any
reference
to
the
prdc
reactor
at
that
stage
was
necessarily
a
reference
to
a
general
type
of
reactor
because
within
the
plans
that
had
thus
far
been
filed,
a
number
of
variance
were
possible
and
indeed,
there
might
be
changes
in
the
specification.
so
that
when
you
--
so
that
this
is
a
matter
of
degree
of
generality
and
it's
very
easy
to
slip
here
from
speaking
of
the
reactors
if
it
were
a
specific
thing,
but
when
in
fact,
it's
only
a
general
type
until
the
alternatives
have
been
excluded
by
getting
all
the
details
of
a
specific
set
of
plans.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
this
would
be
the
first
large-scale
developmental
fast
breeder
reactor.
now,
when
i
say
developmental
fast
breeder
reactor,
i
mean
the
ones
being
used
for
the
purpose
of
research
and
development
in
its
use
as
part
as
a
regularly
operating
part
day
in,
day
out
of
the
utility
grid
system.
i
do
not
mean
an
experimental
reactor
used
for
carrying
on
scientific
experiment.
there
was
a
--
had
been,
when
the
hearings
were
held
since
1951,
i
think
it
was,
certainly
since
1955,
an
experimental
fast
breeder
reactor
that
the
commission
operated
out
in
idaho.
it
all
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
where
the
accident
--
no,
that
was
a
different
reactor.
the
one
that
i
referred
to
that
had
the
accident
in
1960
was
not
a
fast
breeder
reactor.
in
addition,
at
the
time
of
these
hearings,
there
was
scheduled
to
be
built
another
atomic
energy
commission
experimental
reactor,
erb
ii,
it
was
called.
and
there's
a
fast
--
there's
a
developmental
fast
breeder
reactor
in
england
at
dounreay,
scotland.
so
that
before
this
came
to
the
stage
where
anybody
would
talk
about
operating
it,
there
would've
been
experience
with
two
experimental
reactors
and
some
experience
with
the
dounreay
reactor
in
england.
but
in
terms
of
atomic
power
plants
in
this
country,
this
would
be
the
first
of
its
type
and
the
commission
found
that
that
was
one
of
the
very
important
reasons
for
going
ahead
with
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
hearings
were
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
this
--
this,
to
say,
this
is
a
good
time
because
i
slid
over
it
inadvertently.
the
hearings
were
before
a
hearing
examiner.
the
commission
had
a
lawyer
who
was
acting
as
separated
staff
conducting
the
examination
of
some
witnesses.
prdc
was
represented
by
counsel
and
the
intervenors
and
objectors,
the
labor
unions
that
are
respondents
here,
were
parties.
it
was
simply
a
hearing
officer.
he
took
the
testimony.
we
have
three
printed
volumes.
they've
--
actually,
the
hearings
went
on
over
67
months
i
believe.
and
then
the
whole
record
was
transferred
to
the
commission.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
made
no
findings.
the
commission
made
findings
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you
will
find
one
is
of
the
unfortunate
thing
--
confusing
things
about
this
record
is
that
the
first
two
volumes
of
it
were
the
record
as
it
was
in
the
court
below,
as
i
understand
it.
then
the
third
volume
contains
certain
additional
things
that
the
parties
decided
they
want
it
printed.
and
if
my
memory
is
right,
dr.
wallmann's
testimony
appears
in
two
different
volumes.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
this
record
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
that
the
direct
testimony
appears
at
volume
3,
although
perhaps
you
were
looking
at
the
part
in
volume
1
or
2.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
made
that
same
mistake
this
morning
actually.[laughs]
mr.
archibald
cox
they've
been
filed
with
the
clerk,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
then
from
the
hearing
examiner
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
case
was
transferred
to
the
full
commission.
the
commission
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
there
were
two
--
i've
--
i've
got
to
give
a
somewhat
different
answer
before
i
come
to
that.
there
were
--
the
commission
made
in
december
1958
findings
and
rendered
an
opinion
and
they
proposed
order.
then
since
there
was
no
intermediate
report
of
the
trial
examiner
under
its
rules,
now,
the
parties
had
a
chance
to
file
exceptions
in
briefs
to
the
december
findings
and
opinion.
and
then
in
the
spring
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
think
there's
been
oral
argument
even
before
the
december
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and
then
--
but
they
had
a
chance
to
file
more
briefs
in
exception.
and
then
in
the
spring
of
1959,
the
commission
rendered
its
final
opinion,
findings
and
decisions.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
were
three
commissioners
who
took
part,
commissioner
floberg,
graham
and
vance
took
part
in
the
final
decision
and
as
--
also
in
the
intermediate
decision,
yes.
there
was
only
one
of
them,
commissioner
graham,
if
my
memory
is
right,
who
took
any
part
in
the
issuance
of
the
provisional
permit
back
in
august
1956.
mr.
strauss
was
no
longer
on
the
commission
and
neither
was
mr.
thomas
e.
murray
who
had
dissented
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
none
of
the
three.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
none
of
the
three
are
--
mr.
libby
unfortunately
had
not
been
able
to
hear
the
argument
and
therefore
refused
himself.
i
was
mentioning
somewhat
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
that
was
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
the
hearing
examiner.
i
called
attention
somewhat
earlier
to
reg.50.35
which
said
that
a
provisional
construct
--
says
that
a
provisional
construction
permit
will
issue
if
the
commission
has
reasonable
assurance
that
a
facility
of
the
general
type
proposed
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
and
the
--
one
of
the
principal
issues,
of
course,
at
the
hearing,
was
whether
that
finding
was
warranted
with
respect
to
this
reactor
or
not.
and
it's
in
that
connection
that
i
was
going
to
speak,
mr.
justice
brennan,
of
the
possible
explosion.
the
commission's
safety
standards
are
very
high
indeed.
they
require
before
issuing
an
operating
permit
that
there'd
be
a
showing
that
no
credible
accident,
that's
very
remote,
no
credible
accident
can
release
significant
quantities
of
fission
products
into
the
atmosphere.
and
as
i
understand
it,
they
don't
give
you
any
credit
for
all
these
containment.
you
have
to
show
that
the
accident,
the
explosion
can't
occur.
in
this
case,
the
speculation
about
what
is
the
worst
possible
thing
that
can
happen
in
the
reactor
ran
along
these
lines.
supposed
that
all
of
a
sudden,
the
fuel
elements,
in
the
blue
part
here,
were
to
melt,
just
like
that
and
suppose
that
despite
the
fact,
this
upward
flowing
sodium
that
for
some
reason,
the
molten
fuel
all
of
a
sudden,
all
of
it,
assembled
in
a
mass
in
the
bottom
of
the
reactor.
neither
of
those
things,
anybody
knows
how
they
can
happen.
but
suppose
they
did,
then
there
would
be
an
explosion
because
you'd
have
a
critical
mass
of
rather
high
quality
of
fuel.
and
that
explosion
is
the
one
which
i
said
might
come
to
the
equivalent
of
600
pounds
of
tnt.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
--
i'm
afraid
if
you
get
here
beyond
certain
limits
here,
my
knowledge
runs
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
an
awful
lot.
it's
--
it's
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
more
than
the
ordinary
boiler
explosion.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
it
would
not
get
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that's
what
the
--
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
i've
mentioned
earlier.
the
building
will
contain
1000
pounder
explosion.
and
this
is
only
600,
so
it
wouldn't
get
out.
mr.
archibald
cox
get
out
of
the
building.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
but
nevertheless,
and
here
is
the
point,
i
make,
nevertheless,
the
commission
took
the
view
that
before
it
could
permit
such
a
reactor
to
operate,
the
applicant
must
demonstrate
that
such
an
explosion
couldn't
occur,
that
this
hypothetical
thing
couldn't
happen.
now,
in
theory,
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
happen
because
when
the
heat
in
a
reactor
goes
off,
a
great
many
things
happen.
but
one
of
the
things
that
happen
is
that
the
fuel
expands
and
each
atom
gets
a
little
farther
apart
from
every
other
atom.
and
therefore,
it
should
take
a
little
longer
for
the
neutron
to
get
to
it
and
cause
a
fission.
and
this
should
slow
down
the
rate
of
reproduction.
nevertheless,
at
the
time
of
the
hearings,
erb
i,
the
first
of
these
experimental
fast
breeder
reactors,
had
partially
melted
down
in
1955.
it
was
during
a
time
when
a
great
many
safety
mechanisms
were
disconnected.
but
the
fact
was
that
it
had
happened
and
this
seemed
to
indicate
possibly
that
there
was
something
about
fast
breeder
reactors,
which
made
the
theory
i
just
tried
to
state
very
simply,
insufficient.
now,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
the
--
there
was
a
theoretical
scientific
explanation
for
the
meltdown
at
erb
i.
if
you
conceive
of
a
hotspot
in
the
inside
of
the
reactor
here,
the
inside
of
the
blue,
then
the
pins
and
the
entire
fuel
element,
the
side
nearest
the
heat
should
get
hotter
than
the
side
away
from
the
heat,
this
might
make
it
expand
and
this
might
make
the
whole
thing
bow
inward.
and
this
would
bring
the
fuel
closer
together
and
might
therefore
cause
a
speeding
up
of
the
reaction.
and
this
was
what
the
scientist
thought,
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
was
the
explanation
for
the
meltdown
in
erb
i,
but
nobody
had
empirically
proved
it.
it
has
been
proved
today.
there's
--
there's
no
question
about
it
now,
but
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
it
hadn't
been
empirically
proved
and
that's
why
the
commission
said,
"we
think
it's
going
to
prove
out
a
certain
way,
but
at
this
stage,
we
can't
be
sure."
there
was
also
before
the
commission
at
the
hearing
evidence
of
three
ways
of
preventing
any
future
bowing,
upholding
the
fuel
elements
rigidly
in
place.
but
at
that
stage,
no
one
had
proved,
again
empirically,
whether
any
what
--
whether
the
three
ways
would
be
successful.
they
have
now
proved
by
very
elaborate
tests,
although
it
came
after
the
hearing
that
this
honeycomb
construction
--
that's
what
the
honeycombs
do,
they
hold
the
fuel
elements
rigidly
in
place
and
the
larger
subassemblies
are
also
locked
in
place
in
a
way
that
they
can't
bow.
now,
against
the
background
of
this
illustration,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
commission's
findings,
to
which
i
now
turn,
become
quite
plain.
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
page
706
which
is
in
volume
2,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
the
concluding
findings.
in
finding
18,
the
commission
turned
its
attention
to
this
very
type
of
problem
and
found
first,
it
has
not
been
positively
established
that
a
fast
breeder
reactor
of
the
general
type
and
the
power
level
proposed
by
applicant
can
be
operated
without
a
credible
possibility
of
releasing
significant
quantities
of
fission
products
to
the
environment.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
706,
folio
7018.
it's
at
the
bottom.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
that
there,
the
commission
acknowledged
that
it
hadn't
been
positively
proved
that
this
meltdown
couldn't
occur.
i'm
using
the
meltdown
only
as
an
illustration.
there
were
safety
--
other
safety
problems,
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you.
but
this
was
the
most
difficult
and
i
think
it
shows
the
meaning
of
the
finding.
then
it
went
on
and
said
there
is
reasonable
assurance
that
theoretical
and
experimental
investigations
which
have
been
undertaken,
together
with
operating
experience
on
these
various
other
fast
breeder
reactors,
will
establish
definitely
whether
or
not
the
reactor
proposed
by
applicant
can
be
so
operated.
and
then
finally,
there
is
reasonable
assurance
that
evidence
will
establish
that
the
reactor
proposed
by
applicant
can
be
so
operated.
in
other
words,
it
was
making
a
judgment
at
this
stage
as
to
what
further
research
and
development
would
establish
before
the
reactor
could
be
operated.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
is
in
--
he
is
in
--
in
a
consulting
capacity
to
prdc.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
witnesses
--
the
--
there
were
some
witnesses
called
by
the
commission,
others
called
by
the
applicant
and
others
called
by
the
intervenor.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
nearly
all
the
members
of
this
advisory
reactor
safeguards
committee
testified.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
dr.
harvey
brooks
at
harvard
and
whether
a
number
of
them
listed
in
the
--
they
were
well-known
physicist
and
there
was
--
this
is
a
very
--
what
i've
giving
is
a
very
crude
exposition
of
what
the
scientist
testified
to
at
great
length.
and
they
concluded
their
testimony
using
somewhat
different
phrases,
but
nearly
all
of
them
concluded
their
testimony
by
saying
"we
think
that
this
thing
will
prove
out
before
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
there
was
also
independent
witnesses
from
the
commission
and
the
commission's
staff
is
constantly
following
this
all
the
time
and
of
course,
is
constantly
following
it
all
the
time
now.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
--
a
number
of
them
have
now
been
empirically
proved.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
example,
let
me
use
the
--
just
to
be
specific.
let
me
take
this
instance
of
the
meltdown.
they
rebuilt
the
core
of
erb
i
and
they
put
it
through
with
the
proper
instruments
there
through
the
same
sort
of
conditions
that
it
operated
before
and
they
found
that
the
fuel
elements
did
bow
in.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
because
that
--
that
will
come
up
later.
you
see,
the
provisional
construction
permit,
while
it
is
based
on
a
finding
that
there
was
reasonable
assurance
that
this
thing
would
prove
out,
it
is
also
conditioned
upon
the
commission's
--
really
make
a
number
of
determinations.
first,
it
must
be
found
that
it's
been
built,
this
is
in
the
statute.
second,
it
must
be
found
that
the
necessary
information
has
been
furnished.
third,
there
must
be
a
finding
that
it
will
operate
in
accordance
with
the
statute
and
the
commission's
regulations.
and
as
part
of
that,
because
it's
in
the
regulation,
there
must
be
this
finding
that
the
final
design,
that
means
every
last
job
will
operate
in
such
a
way
that
it
will
not
cause
a
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'm
--
would
--
as
the
record
stands
before
you,
these
were
predictions
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
made
by
scientists
in
a
contested
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
aren't
my
predictions.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
--
but
it
--
i'd
--
i
again
don't
want
to
go
beyond
what's
proper.
this
is
informal
information.
and
i'm
simply
--
i'm
really
giving
it
to
the
court
not
to
claim
that
this
has
proved
safe
because
that's
not
the
issue
here.
that'll
come
up
on
the
hearing
of
the
operate.
i'm
giving
it
to
the
court
simply
to
illustrate
this
process
of
saying
that
--
of
inquiring
first,
is
there
a
good
enough
chance
that
this
will
prove
safe?
that
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
--
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what
--
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
is
to
find
--
is
to
rule
that
this
finding
that
there
was
reasonable
assurance
that
a
reactor
of
the
type
proposed
could
be
operated
without
danger
to
the
health
or
safety
of
the
public
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
is
enough
under
the
statute
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
for
the
construction
permit
to
issue.
and
i've
got
to
come,
if
i
don't'
get
too
lost
in
the
effect,
i've
got
to
come
to
argue
that
point,
of
course.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
answer
--
your
first
question
is
that
you
clearly
do
not
pass
de
novo
on
the
commission's
findings
or
expert
judge
--
judgment
as
to
safety.
as
i'll
point
out
later,
the
question
of
those
findings,
and
i
will
argue,
the
standards
to
be
set
up
or
all
coveted
by
the
commission
--
to
--
to
the
commission
by
the
statute.
i
--
i
should
also
say
that
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
no
argument
here
that
such
findings
as
the
commission
made
were
not
supported
by
its
substantial
testimony.
there
is
some
argument
about
what
the
finding
mean
but
there's
ample
--
i
think
it's
conceded
that
there's
ample
evidence
to
support
them.
so
you
don't
have
to
go
behind
them
in
any
sense.
now,
the
second
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
really
understand
that
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
you're
speaking
of
the
scope
of
reviews,
substantial
evidences
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
well,
there's
--
it's
been
agreed
all
along
that
the
commission's
standard
of
reasonably
safe
complies
with
the
statute.
there's
--
there's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
a
--
i
--
yes,
i
think
it's
agreed
that
they
applied
those
standards
in
this
case
by
difficulty
and
perhaps,
i'd
better
jump
on
to
it,
is
that
there
is
some
argument
about
the
meaning
of
the
findings.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
so,
except
that
we
have
omitted
one
question
that
the
respondent
interjects.
now,
if
i
might
just
get
to
the
concluding
finding
of
the
commission,
i
think
that
then,
some
of
these
questions
--
the
answer
to
some
of
these
questions
would
become
clear.
i'd
summarize
the
findings
having
to
do
with
the
safety
of
the
reactor.
then,
the
next
groups
of
findings,
19
through
21,
have
to
deal
with
the
site.
and
the
commission
found
that
the
site,
if
this
problem
of
meltdown
and
other
safety
problems
could
be
solved,
that
there
reasonable
assurance
that
the
site
would
prove
satisfactory.
then
in
finding
22,
the
commission
finds,
and
this
is
the
concluding
finding,
now,
i
think
in
here
is
the
answer
to
your
question,
justice
frankfurter.
the
commission
finds
reasonable
assurance
in
the
record
for
the
purposes
of
this
provisional
construction
permit
that
the
utilization
facility
of
the
general
type
proposed
in
the
prdc
application
and
amendments
thereto
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
location
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
now,
it
is
agreed,
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
commission's
standard
of
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public
is
as
high
as
the
statute
requires.
that
is
phrased
by
the
commission
in
terms
of
a
required
showing
that
no
credible
accident
will
release
significant
quantities
of
fission
products
to
the
surrounding
atmosphere.
and
it's
agreed
that
that
is
high
enough
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
statute.
the
point
which
is
in
dispute
and
the
issue
in
addition
of
--
to
the
questions
stated
in
our
brief
that
is
here,
mr.
justice
black,
is
whether
this
phrase
for
the
purposes
of
this
provisional
construction
permit
somehow
waters
down
or
denigrates
finding
22.
let
me
be
even
more
explicit
and
i
will
then
move
on
to
begin
to
argue
some
of
the
points
of
law.
section
50.35,
which
i
referred
to
earlier,
provides
that
a
construction
permit
may
be
issued,
this
is
one
of
the
commission's
regulations
under
the
statute,
if
the
commission
has
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
a
facility
of
the
general
type
proposed
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
constructed
--
this
is
for
issuing
a
constructed
permit
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
but
the
finding
pertains
to
construction
and
operation.
and
--
now,
if
you
look
at
finding
22,
you
will
find
that
it
uses
exactly
the
language
of
reg.50.35
with
one
exception.
the
exemption
is
that
22
includes,
for
the
purposes
of
this
provisional
construction
permit,
and
as
i
understand
mr.
sigal's
brief,
he
argues
that
the
inclusion
of
that
phrase
watered
down
the
kind
of
assurance
that
the
commission
found
and
therefore,
it
prevents
the
finding
from
complying
with
reg.50.35.
so
that
in
addition
to
the
two
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
posed
in
our
brief,
there
is
this
additional
question,
whether
finding
22
and
the
other
subsidiary
finding
complies
with
the
commission's
own
regulations.
mr.
archibald
cox
section
185
does,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
don't
think
that
anybody
rely
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
anyone
puts
any
stress
on
that
phrase
because
i
don't
think
anyone
knows
what
it
means.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
very
cryptic.
i
take
it,
it
means
is
acceptable
except
in
the
sense
that
it's
an
application
for
a
preliminary
permit
and
is
therefore
subject
to
certain
limitations
that
would
not
be
true
of
an
application
for
a
final
permit.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
might
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
postpone
that
for
a
moment.
that
i
--
might
i
just,
for
a
moment,
speak
further
to
the
question
of
whether
the
findings
comply
with
the
regulations,
then
i
will
direct
myself
to
the
critical
question
as
the
court
of
appeals
saw
it,
whether
this
two-step
procedure
conforms
to
the
statute.
we
think
that
the
answer
to
the
question
whether
the
findings
conform
to
the
regulations
is
supplied
by
simply
putting
finding
22
next
to
reg.50.35.
it's
conceded
here
that
the
commission
stated
the
issue
in
the
notice
of
hearing
in
terms
of
reg.50.35.
it
stated
it,
at
those
terms,
several
times
in
the
course
of
its
opinion.
it
states
it
in
terms
of
--
in
those
terms
in
finding
18,
which
i
read,
to
illustrate
the
difference
between
general
assurance
as
to
what
investigation
would
prove
and
a
specific
finding
of
safety
of
operation.
and
it
uses
the
very
language
of
50.35
here
in
22
except
for
this
phrase,
"for
the
purposes
of
this
provisional
construction
permit".
and
we
think
to
suppose
that
the
commission
had
followed
a
proper
standard
all
the
way
up
to
this
point,
and
then
also,
it
used
the
words
of
the
regulation
to
suppose
that
it
suddenly
had
a
different
meaning
here
is
simply
to
accuse
it
of
nonsense.
in
fact,
the
--
for
--
the
parenthetical
phrase
serves
a
useful
function.
it
states
--
it
modifies
fines
and
states
the
purpose
for
which
the
finding
is
made.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
quality
of
assurance
or
the
quality
of
the
safety.
and
that
it
says
we're
making
this
finding
only
for
the
purposes
of
the
provisional
construction
permit.
this
saves
the
rights
of
the
objector.
it's
a
warning
to
prdc
that
we
aren't
passing
on
anything
more
than
the
construction
permit
now.
and
when
you
read
the
opinion,
you
will
find
they
said
over
and
over
again
that
you're
going
forward
at
your
parent,
that
we
are
not
committing
ourselves
beyond
finding
that
this
is
likely
enough
to
prove
out
for
us
to
permit
you
to
risk
your
capital,
if
you
wish
to
do
it,
since
that
will
increase
our
knowledge
and
your
knowledge
even
if
the
reactor
is
never
built.
we
think
it's
likely
enough
so
that
it
isn't
wasted.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
argument
is
made.
i
think
the
answer
to
it
is
two-fold.
first,
that
everything
possible
to
prevent
the
momentum
has
been
done
here,
the
--
the
record
replete
with
warning.
and
second,
that
when
one
is
dealing
with
something
as
momentous
as
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public
and
the
worst
kind
of
accident,
that
the
momentum
of
the
financial
investment
wouldn't
be
very
great.
after
all,
we
are
reaching
the
point
in
science
and
engineering
where
people
do
expend
large
sums
on
research
and
development
and
sometimes
it
doesn't
prove
out.
that's
not
an
unknown
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
not
the
commission's
money.
now,
the
second
question
and
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
chiefly
concerned
with
is
whether
this
two-step
procedure
on
the
findings
conforms
to
the
statute.
the
atomic
energy
act
of
1954
made
a
new
departure
from
the
previous
monopoly
that
the
government
had
had
of
all
atomic
energy
and
the
aim
is
stated
by
congress
was
to
encourage
private
participation
in
the
peaceful
development
of
atomic
energy.
in
order
to
set
up
the
necessary
regulation,
the
statute
provides
a
very
detailed
licensing
scheme
for
all
transfers
of
fissionable
material,
for
constructing
or
operating
facilities
for
using
them,
even
for
an
individual
operator's
license
before
you
can
be
at
the
control
board
of
a
reactor.
the
licensing
sections,
you
will
find
beginning
at
page
109
of
our
brief,
section
101
simply
forbids
all
kinds
of
conduct
without
a
license.
section
103
at
the
bottom
of
page
109
provides
for
the
issuance
of
commercial
licenses,
and
i
would
point
out
that
in
subsection
(b),
over
on
the
page
110,
“the
commission
is
authorized
to
issue
licenses
to
people
who
are
equipped
to
observe
and
who
agree
to
observe
such
safety
standards
to
prevent
health
and
to
minimize
danger
to
life
or
property
as
the
commission
may,
by
rule,
prescribe."
in
other
words,
the
safety
standards
under
103
are
clearly
delegated
to
the
commission's
rules.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
applies
to
licenses
for
commercial
facilities.
later
on
in
a
section
that
i'd
like
to
postpone
coming
to,
justice
stewart,
there
is
a
declaration
that
a
construction
permit
shall
be
deemed
a
license,
and
it
would
be
license
for
a
purpose
of
103.
then
section
104b
authorizes
the
issuance
of
licenses
for
developmental
reactors,
that's
what
we
have
here.
and
it
provides
that
in
issuing
licenses,
the
commission
shall
impose
the
minimum
amount
of
such
regulations
and
terms
of
license,
as
will
permit
the
commission
to
fulfill
its
obligations
under
this
act
and
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
and
i
emphasize
again
that
it's
the
amount
of
regulation
imposed
by
the
commission
as
will
permit
it
to
fulfill
its
obligations
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
and
over
on
a
112
down
at
(d),
just
before
section
105,
there's
a
prohibition
against
issuing
a
license
if,
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission,
the
issuance
of
a
license
to
such
a
person
would
be
inimicable
to
the
heath
and
safety
of
the
public.
and
you
will
find
in
section
161
a
very
broad
general
rule
making
power
giving
the
commission
authority
to
make
rules
necessary
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
our
view
is,
taking
these
sections
of
the
act
first,
that
although
congress
was
obviously
greatly
concerned
about
safety
as
anyone
would
be,
that
it
delegated
that
responsibility
to
the
atomic
energy
commission.
and
we
think
it's
also
quite
clear
from
these
provisions
that
the
commission
was
given
full
power
to
issue
regulations
dealing
with
safety,
including
regulations
proscribing
the
findings
to
be
made
at
the
various
stages
of
the
construction
and
bringing
up
to
power
of
a
developmental
reactor.
and
so
that
so
far
as
these
sections
of
the
act
are
concerned,
it
seems
perfectly
plain
that
the
two-step
procedure
was
within
the
statutory
authority.
the
argument
in
the
court
below
revolves
very
largely
around
sections
182
and
section
185.182
begins
over
on
page
123
of
our
brief.
it
describes
what
should
be
contained
in
license
applications.
you'll
note
at
the
very
beginning,
each
application
for
a
license
shall
be
in
writing
and
so
forth.
then
the
second
sentence,
in
connection
with
applications
for
licenses
to
operate
production
or
utilization
facilities,
the
applicant
shall
state
such
technical
specifications,
and
i
omit
some
words
and
such
other
information
as
the
commission,
made
by
rule
or
regulation,
deemed
necessary
in
order
to
enable
it
to
find
that
the
utilization
or
production
of
special
nuclear
material
will
provide,
on
the
next
page,
adequate
protection
of
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
then,
justice
stewart,
on
page
126,
you'll
find
the
sections
dealing
with
construction
permits.
the
first
sentence
authorizes
the
issue
of
construction
permits.
mr.
archibald
cox
126
of
our
brief.
first
sentence
says
that,
"applicants
for
licenses
shall,
if
the
application
is
otherwise
acceptable,
be
issued
a
construction
permit."
and
then
it
goes
on
and
provides
what
shall
be
in
the
permit,
and
finally
that,
"upon
the
satisfaction
of
certain
conditions,"
that
i
stated
earlier,
four
of
them,
including
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
commission's
regulations,
"a
license
to
operate
shall
be
issued”.
then
you
will
find
the
last
sentence
reads,
"for
all
other
purposes
of
this
act,
a
construction
permit
is
to
be
deemed
a
license."
the
respondent's
argument
is
that
relying
on
this
sentence,
one
must
read
construction
permit
into
the
language
in
section
182
which
reads,
"in
connection
with
license
--
with
applications
for
licenses
to
operate
production
or
utilization
facilities,
the
applicant
shall
state
certain
information
as
will
enable
the
commission
to
find
and
so
forth."
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
three
self-sufficient
answers
to
that
contention.
the
first
is
that
the
second
sentence
of
section
185
is
not
applicable
to
licenses
generally,
but
only
to
licenses
to
operate
construction
or
utilization
facilities.
and
we
think
the
most
meaning
that
can
be
given
to
this
final
sentence
of
185
is
that
an
application
for
a
construction
permit
shall
be
the
--
the
equivalent
of
licenses
generally,
but
not
equivalent
to
any
particular
license
or
every
particular
license.
now,
that
at
first
blush
may
sound
a
little
extreme.
but
i
point
out
that
the
act
does
set
up
specifications
in
some
places
for
particular
kinds
of
licenses.
and
in
other
places,
it
speaks
of
licenses
generally.
for
example,
is
the
section
that
deals
with
a
license
to
be
an
operator
of
an
individual,
a
reactor
and
clearly,
a
construction
permit
isn't
equivalent
to
that
kind
of
license.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
don't
--
the
--
the
commission
stated
that
it
did
not
make
the
kind
of
finding
that
it
deemed
necessary
for
a
license
to
operate.
there's
no
--
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
i
think
this
is
a
crucial
point
in
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
question
in
the
statute?
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
major
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
other
question
which
i
think
is
in
the
case,
although
i
am
not
sure,
is
the
alternative
ground
of
opinion
in
the
court
below.
the
court
below
seemed
to
say
that
in
order
to
issue
a
construction
permit
for
a
reactor
near
a
large
city,
the
commission
must
make
a
special
finding
that
there
were
compelling
reasons
for
putting
it
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
rather
than
that
in
the
desert
someplace
and
the
commission
didn't
make
that
kind
of
finding.
now,
i
don't
really
think
this
is
a
very
serious
issue.
the
respondent's
don't
stand
on
it.
you
can
go
all
through
the
statute
and
try
to
find
any
mention
of
compelling
reasons.
and
in
addition,
it's
contrary
to
the
established
practice
of
the
commission.
so
i
think
in
terms
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
this
is
the
critical
issue
in
the
case.
my
second
answer,
so
far
as
the
words
go,
is
that
the
respondent's
argument
ignores
the
limitation
at
the
end
of
section
185
for
all
other
purposes
of
this
act,
a
construction
permit
is
to
be
deemed
the
license.
now,
i
take
it
that
means
purposes
other
than
those
implied
by
185.
it
would
seem
to
me
quite
clear
from
reading
185
that
one
of
its
purposes
is
to
authorize
a
construction
permit
before
you
have
got
all
the
information.
indeed,
it
speaks
of
the
case
where
the
applicant
isn't
able
to
supply
all
the
information
and
speaks
of
finding
it
later
before
the
license
to
operate
is
furnished.
then
the
third
answer,
which,
again,
i
think
is
complete,
is
that
section
185
--
182a
does
not
proscribe
the
making
of
any
particular
finding.
if
you
will
read
it
carefully,
you'll
see
that
it
reads
that
in
filing
an
application
for
a
license
for
operating,
the
applicant
shall
include
certain
kinds
of
information
that
will
enable
the
commission
to
make
a
finding,
but
it
doesn't
say
when
those
findings
are
to
be
made,
nor
does
it
say
anything
about
what
specific
finding
is
to
be
made
at
any
specific
time.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
authority
for
the
findings
and
the
ruling
the
statutory
provision
is
governing
the
findings
that
the
commission
is
to
make
are
those
in
104
that
i
called
your
attention
to
earlier
and
which
it
has
detailed
to
some
extent
in
its
regulation.
now,
if
there
is
any
doubt
on
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
it
would
seem
to
us
that
that
is
clear
enough
by
the
uniform
interpretation
of
the
commission
and
the
congressional
acquiescence.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
in
all
the
other
cases
of
developmental
power
reactors,
this
two-step
procedure
has
been
filed.
we've
quoted
the
permits
in
our
reply
brief
one
at
a
time,
so
there
can't
be
any
argument
on
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
most
of
them
--
let's
see,
i
think
they've
only
been
three
operating
licenses
issued.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
developmental
power
reactors.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
of
the
reasons
for
that,
justice
douglas
is
that
even
today
there
is
a
constant
review
and
laying
down
of
requirements
of
what
should
go
into
this
reactor.
there's
constant
working
together
between
the
staff
of
the
commission,
the
prdc
and
copies
are
all
given
to
the
intervenors,
and
they're
welcome
to
participate
in
the
discussion.
so,
i
guess
you
really
know
pretty
much
before
you
come
on
to
the
final
hearing
of
what
the
commission
is
requiring.
and
that,
of
course,
reduces
the
chance
that
it
would
be
denied.
now,
i
said
that
all
--
in
every
previous
case,
this
same
two-step
procedure
has
been
followed.
it
is
also
true
that
the
two-step
procedure
on
several
occasions
has
been
explained
to
the
joint
committee
on
atomic
energy
(inaudible).
there,
i
think,
can
be
no
doubt
about
that.
and
there
has
been
the
equivalent
of
acquiescence.
the
only
way
in
which
the
consistent
interpretation
by
the
commission
and
the
reports
to
the
--
to
the
congressional
committee
can
be
distinguished
from
this
case
is
by
that
phrase,
"for
the
purposes
of
this
construction
permit."
that
phrase
did
not
appear
in
the
hearings
or
licenses,
construction
permits
issued
earlier.
this
was,
indeed,
the
only
contested
case,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
anyone
who
reads
the
thrust
of
the
whole
findings
will
see
that
this
was
put
in
in
order
to
make
it
plain
that
they
were
proceeding
only
a
step
at
a
time,
and
that
they
weren't
either
giving
the
company
right
or
foreclosing
any
rights
on
the
part
of
the
respondent.
