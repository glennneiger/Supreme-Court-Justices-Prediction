justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
solicitor,
is
the
reactor
located
in
a
building
of
any
special
character?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
--
don't
tell
us
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
they're
coming
back
to
the
explosion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
makes
no
findings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
that
the
--
december
findings
and
opinion
were
based
on
the
record
without
oral
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
that
means,
the
equivalent
of
600
pounds
of
tnt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
an
explosion
of
600
pounds
of
tnt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
blow
up
the
building?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
would
it
blow
up
the
building?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
no
--
and
what
--
as
i
get
it,
the
conclusion
is
that
no
effects
of
the
explosion
can
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
judgment
now
is
get
outside
the
shell
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
which
is
the
building.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
solicitor,
now,
these
--
these
were
in
the
nature
of
predictions
of
what
would
be
the
results
of
then
are
current
theoretical
and
experimental
investigations.
i
think
you
said
one's
advice
was,
to
some
of
them,
empirically,
some
of
these
things
have
been
proved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
has
there
been
any
record
made
in
the
way
additional
hearing
or
otherwise
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
really
what
i'm
getting
at,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
would
support
what
you
told
us
or
are
you
telling
us
something
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you're
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
what
--
you're
--
you're
now
telling
us
what
the
commission,
i
gather,
as
advised
you,
has
been
the
results
of
this
occurrence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
can't
--
i
--
i
gather,
we
can't
reach
our
decision
based
on
what
you
have
told
us,
namely,
that
these
--
and
that
these
experiments
have
in
fact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
50
years
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
is
really
a
--
is
this
really
what
we
have
to
decide
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
very
question?
yes,
this
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
one,
what
else
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
rather
than
that
in
the
deserts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
--
but
the
--
preliminarily,
before
the
construction
permit
is
issued,
as
i
get
you,
the
finding
must
be
made
which
the
government
says
does
not
have
to
be
made
until
the
operating
license.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
one
--
one
last
thing
mr.
sigal,
is
--
is
there
a
difference
in
the
criteria
perhaps
is
the
right
word,
namely
is
the
first
finding
which
you
say
hasn't
been
made
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
finding
different
in
quality
or
content
from
the
finding
you
say
must
follow
this
for
operation
purposes.
in
other
words,
the
language
of
the
first
finding
which
you
say
hasn't
been
made
is
that
the
commission
has
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
and
so
forth.
then
you
say
there
has
to
be
an
evaluation
after
construction
with
a
finding
--
finding
that
the
final
design
provides
reasonable
assurance
that
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public
will
not
be
endangered,
are
they
different
finding
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
are
the
identical
things?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
may
--
i
mean
to
the
--
the
first
one,
is
the
commission,
"has
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
second
one
is
that
the
final
design
provides
reasonable
assurance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
difference
between
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
is
that
the
way
it
reads
mr.
sigal?
it
says
in
the
first
one,
dealing
now
only
with
the
construction
firm,
that
if
the
commission
has
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance.
now,
that's
not
like
the
second
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
final
design
does
provide
reasonable
assurances?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
getting
back
to
where
you
and
i
left
off
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
getting
back
to
where
you
and
i
left
off
last
night,
i
thought
i
understood
it,
so
i
just
heard
you
answer
mr.
justice
black.
i
know
what
you
told
us
last
night
was
that
the
finding
at
this
stage
is
identical
with
the
finding
that
has
to
be
made
at
the
operational
safe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
92
of
what
mr.
sigel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
your
brief?
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
--
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
turning
your
mind
to
that
particularly?
