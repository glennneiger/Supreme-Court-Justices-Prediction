the

on

the

additional

justice

well,
now,
that

testimony
elicited

as
i

it
not?
justice

and
i'd
like
to
ask
you
as
to
that,
the
nature
of

of

the

justice

but
this
was
not
--
these
were
not
conclusions
based
on
contending
claims
by
two
selfishly
interested
parties.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
want
to
pull
you
up
on
whatever
further
new
provisions.
the
fact
is
necessary
but
it
will
help
me
very
much.
indeed,
i
should
have
asked
this
question
to
you
earlier.
it
will
help
me
very
much
in
taking
in
your
fact
or
shaping
my
mind
toward
understanding
the
relevance
of
what
you
tell
us.
if
you
will
tell
without
arguing
just
precisely
what
our
function
in
relation
to
this
problem
is,
(a)
do
we
sit
in
judgment
on
the
validity
of
the
prophetic
conclusions
which
the
commission
drew,
at
the
de
novo,
say,
at
a
de
novo
judgment,
(b)
do
we
sit
in
judgment
on
the
criteria
which
the
commission
applied
insofar
as
it
revealed
its
criteria
in
passing
judgment
on
the
fact,
bearing
in
mind
that
learned
hand's
admonition,
when
he
was
a
very
young
district
judge,
of
the
competence
of
judges
to
pass
on
these
kinds
of
technical
matter
far
simpler
than
these
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
standard
by
which
allowable
judgment
on
the
facts
were
based.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
facts
have
to
be
--
the
findings
on
facts
are
based
on
certain
criteria
for
determining
what
the
conclusion
--
what
the
allowable
conclusions
from
those
facts
are.
what
i
want
to
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
scope
of
review,
but
what
--
how
do
they
ascertain
that?
maybe
they
made
a
wrong
--
maybe
they
judged
whether
these
safeguards
were
adequate
by
applying
the
--
the
wrong
notion
of
what
a
safeguard
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
apply
those
standards
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
ask
you
whether
you
will
be
considering
a
phrase
that
doesn't
reveal
itself,
the
meaning
of
which
is
not
to
reveal
itself
made
by
it.
in

"all
applicants

licenses
to
construct
or
modify
production
or
utilization

--
facilities
shall,
if
the
application
is
otherwise
acceptable
to
the
commission,"
i
don't
know
what
that
means,
but
does
that
play
any
part
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
that
particular
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
the
application
is
otherwise
acceptable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
quite
cryptic,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
suppose,
does
it
mean
that
they
may
reject
for
--
for
reason
that
isn't
specifically
spelled
out
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
say
--
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
suggestion
that
the
capital
at
risk
is
very
considerable
in
these
things,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
a
provisional
--
a
provisional
grant
carries
with
it
a
momentum
of
future
acquiesces.
is
that
the
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
isn't
the
commission's
money
anyhow.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
--
that
question,
your
question
presented,
your
number
one
was
not
directly,
does
it,
by
implication
challenge
the
so
called
two-step
procedure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
challenge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
challenge
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
ask
you
this.
either
requirements
or
findings
--
absence
of
undue
risk
for
the
construction
permit,
are
they
eidetic
from
your
point
of
view
of
those
that
you'd
governed,
granting
an
operation
of
permit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
yours
--
is
your
view
of
the
statutes
permit
the
commission
to
have
a
prophetic
view
or
a
tentative,
a
more
or
less
tentative
view,
whatever
your
high
standards
may
be,
for
determining
that
safety
is
safeguarded
and
a
different
or
stiffer
(inaudible)
with
greater
knowledge
--
view
when
it
comes
to
granting
an
operational
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
this
spell
out
that
there
are
two
stages
separated
in
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
is
the
--
is
the
final
grant
merely
a
duty
of
ascertaining
whether
the
conditions
for
the
construction
grant
have
been
satisfied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
know
what
substantially
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
take
into
account
additional
or
different
or
differently
demonstrated
circumstances.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
matter
of
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
the
government
--
does
the
government's
argument
state
or
imply
that
when
they
grant
a
construction
permit,
they
can
be
indifferent
to
how
the
thing
will
work
out
by
operation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
they
concerned
--
are
they
concerned
merely
whether
the
construction
of
the
thing
sufficiently
takes
that
light?
are
you
suggesting
that
they
don't
have
to
bother
about
a
forecast
whether
that,
which
is
to
be
constructed,
is
likely
to
be
safeguardedly
operated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
government
deny
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
me
to
be
very
specific
and
concrete,
you
mean
if
this
permit
were
allowed
to
stand,
they
would
have
to
give
him
a
--
an
operation
of
permit
subjectly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talk
--
i'm
not
talking
about
the
condition,
i
want
to
know
what
you
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
understood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justices'
question
just
now
to
necessarily
imply
that.
that
the
law
didn't
mean
people
to
spend
$100
million
and
then
have
their
request
for
an
operational
permit
rejected.isn't
that
what
is
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
you'd
say
that
if
this
grant
--this
permit
stands,
they
must
give
him
an
operation
of
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
just
--
would
you
be
good
enough
to
take
my
assumption
that
this
court
finds
that
the
commission
satisfies
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
just
make
that
assumption.
i
understand
correctly
or
not,
that
if
that
is
allowed
to
stand,
your
view
is
that
they
would
have
to
be
granted
the
operational
permit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sigal,
my
--
my
question
assumed
that
this
court
would
find
that
they
had
complied
with
the
law.
and
therefore,
that
there
was
a
compliance
with
the
law
and
my
--
on
that
assumption,
your
answer
is
that
they
would
hereafter
have
to
give
them
an
operational
grant.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
want
to
answer,
don't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
if
they
haven't
completed
it,
they
haven't
completed
it,
therefore,
they
can't
operate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
assume
that
they
would
operate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
this
court
holds
that
the
findings
were
satisfy,
then
the
necessarily
findings
were
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
well,
how
will
i
know
about
the
consequences
of
that
loss?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
want
to
know
the
consequences
of
that
loss
and
you've
stated
it
if
i
can
understand
english
language,
that
this
case
is
reversed
on
the
ground
that
the
commission
did
satisfy
the
duty
it
had
under
the
statute
and
the
plant
is
finished
and
operational
permit
must
be
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
does
the
solicitor
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sigal
i
don't
quite
follow
why
there
is
built-in
disability
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
what
dr.
wolman
was
talking
about.
of
course,
businessmen
who
want
to
promote
business
have
one
interest
as
against
in
public
safety.
i
was
--
i
just
wondered
what
the
business
thinks
of.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
atomic
energy
commission
wants
to
promote
reactors
for
--
for
industrial
economic
purposes,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
the
natural
optimism
of
a
businessman
who
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
any
event
that
--
that's
severe
--
that
may
well
be
a
valid
criticism
of
what
congress
has
done
in
lodging
the
power
in
the
commission
for
the
granting
of
this
premise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sigal,
the
--
the
government
of
course
can
enlarge
the
scope
or
the
discretion
given
by
the
statute
to
the
commission,
can
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
what
they
say
in
their
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
from
you
is,
do
you
attack
the
delegation
given
in
this
statute
as
either
the
statute
being
an
invalid
unconstitutional
delegation
by
congress
or
the
regulation
which
have
sought
to
implement
the
statute
as
ultravirus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
do
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
thought
of
that
act.
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
this
is
not
an
unconstitutional
delegation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
that
the
regulations
which
they
formulated
under
their
delegation
are
not
ultravirus.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
them
--
they
misconstrue
this
--
they've
--
they
exercised
power
beyond
the
delegation
that
congress
gave
them
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
they
didn't
apply
their
own
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sigal,
i
think
in
the
purport
of
the
--
give
to
--
to
you
and
justice
harlan,
gets
down
to
this.
from
myself,
i
couldn't
subscribe
to
more
heartily
that
the
exercise
of
these
powers
requires
men
of
the
highest
possible
competent,
of
the
highest
possible
disinterestedness
and
the
highest
possible
courage.
so
that
they
are
safe
to
an
investment
of
$80
million,
we're
sorry
that
you
can't
operate
it,
because
we
now
find
it
wouldn't
sufficiently
(inaudible)
can
you
escape
--
can
you
escape
no
matter
what,
the
exercise
of
discretion
that
courts
of
the
kind
of
equal
might
try
to
categorize?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
can't
--
and
you
can't
--
and
you
can't
protect
the
hazards
of
the
exercise
of
that
discretion,
except
by
the
quality
of
the
men
in
whom
it
is
vested.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
standards
--
the
standards
which
the
law
has
imposed,
you
do
not
challenge
here.
what
you're
challenging
is
that
these
--
that
the
commission
didn't
act
upon
the
standards
which
found
them.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
as
to
the
form
of
the
standard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
standards
or
the
--
does
that
--
or
the
way
in
which
the
standards
were
once
satisfied?
what
does
the
lower
court
do
with
this
case,
didn’t
say
these
permits
should
have
been
issued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
for
what?
not
--
not
because
of
what,
but
for
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
could
do
that
within
--
did
it
say,
they
must
--
they
mustn't
take
less
a
year
in
finding
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
--
found
a
necessary
standard
that
--
your
standard
within
a
week,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
also
might
have
found
what
you
are
--
that
your
standard
was
satisfied
pass
a
week's
further
investigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
--
i
understand
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
put
to
you
what
is
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
come
out
with
the
same
findings
of
--
that
safety
is
--
as
guaranteed
as
humanly
scientifically
possible
as
of
the
date
they
make
the
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
meaning
myself,
for
purposes
of
this
construction
grant
nearly
puts
--
is
an
additional
announcement
of
the
world
that
this
is
a
contingent
grant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
for
the
purposes
of
the
construction
grant
as
to
me
putting
and
emphasizing
words,
the
fact
that
it's
a
contingent
grant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
don't
agree.
i'm
just
--
i
know
you
don't
agree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
--
the
permit
granted
thus
far
have
all
been
developmental
reactor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix

mr.

of
the
kind
of
reactor
that
you've
last
delineated
or
(inaudible)
part
of
the
submission
both
keep
its
hold
on
the

of
the
successive

yes.

affirm
on
each

each
of

--
justice

limited,
is
it?
justice

may
i
ask
whether
the

authorizes

indicates
submission
for
such
a
regulatory
administrative
procedure?
