isn't
the
master
finding
number
22?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
34?
justice
john
m.
harlan
22.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
about
22.
if
the
phrase
for
the
purposes
of
this
provisional
construction
permit
were
deleted,
would
you
say
the
finding
was
adequate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
wouldn't
be
adequate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
your
finding
is
sufficient,
you're
not
attacking
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
support
the
finding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
certainly
couldn't
be
called
on
to
review
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
it
--
would
it
be
your
view,
mr.
sigal,
under
your
construction
that
if
a
proper
finding
as
you
view
it,
has
been
made
at
the
time
of
the
construction
permit
and
then
in
the
light
of
--
after
acquired
scientific
information,
it
developed
the
basis
of
the
finding,
which
looked
adequate
at
that
time,
was
not
justified
scientifically
that
the
permit
with
(inaudible)
have
to
issue?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
see
why
it
just
--
approaching
from
different
ends.
the
point
is
before
the
plant
can
start
operating,
they
have
got
to
make
a
finding
of
safety,
irrespective
of
what
they've
done
before.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
i
don't
view
what
the
difference
is
between
you
and
the
government
once
you
say
that
they
do
have
the
power
that
i
suggested.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
hazard
will
be
present
even
under
your
construction
of
the
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
hazard
will
be
present
under
--
even
under
your
construction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
can't
get
rid
of
that
hazard
completely
under
any
construction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
that
they
started
with
a
presumption
that
these
men
are
going
to
do
their
duty
and
that
they're
competent,
you
got
to
start
with
that
presumption.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
go
on?
in
connection
with
these
pressures
that
you
relied
such
emphasis
on,
was
there
any
discussion
in
congress
as
to
the
relieving
of
those
pressures
by
having
the
government
reimburse
on
recommendation
of
the
commission?
justice
john
m.
harlan
reimburse
a
project
that
in
good
faith
has
been
undertaken
and
then
had
found
to
be
unsafe.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would've
been
one
surer
way
of
alleviating
those
pressures,
would
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
--
the
best
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
finding
in
terms
covers
operation.
finding
22
covers
operation
and
at
the
proposed
location.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
got
to
read
out
operation
if
you
put
your
--
your
construction
in
place.
