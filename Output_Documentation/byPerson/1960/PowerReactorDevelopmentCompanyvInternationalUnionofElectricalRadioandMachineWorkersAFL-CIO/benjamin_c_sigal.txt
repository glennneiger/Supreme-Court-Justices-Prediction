mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
review
at
the
outset,
some
of
the
safety
considerations
which
i
fear
were
not
adequately
explicated
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
issue
as
stated
in
our
brief
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
is
more
clearly
and
explicitly
sets
forth
the
issue.
now,
that
--
on
page
--
page
2.
now,
our
--
our
position
is
that
the
commission
failed
to
make
the
necessary
findings
with
respect
to
safety
and
that
it
failed
to
make
--
specifically
to
make
a
finding
with
--
at
the
time
that
it
issued
the
construction
permit,
that
there
was
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
the
reactor
could
be
operated
at
the
proposed
site
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
your
honor.
i
think
it
does
not
challenge
it.
there
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
there
are
two
--
pardon.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
we
challenge
the
two-step
procedure
as
defined
and
explained
by
the
government.
we
say
that
the
two-step
procedure,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
law
and
in
the
regulations,
is
different
from
the
two-step
procedure
which
they
--
which
the
petitioners
claim
is
the
procedure.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
formula
is
the
same,
that
is,
that
when
the
construction
permit
is
issued,
we
say
there
should
be
a
finding
that
the
commission
should
make
a
finding
that
it
has
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
the
reactor
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
site
without
undue
risk.
then,
when
it
comes
to
making
the
final
inspection,
they
make
another
finding
of
the
same
kind,
namely,
that
they
have
reasonable
assurance
that
the
reactor
can
be
operated
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
statute
itself
doesn't
spell
this
out
with
--
as
much
explicitness
as
might
be
desired.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
it
does
set
out
in
section
185
that
when
the
--
after
the
issuance
of
the
construction
permit,
when
the
commission
is
satisfied
that
the
conditions
of
the
construction
permit
have
been
complied
with,
then
a
license
may
issue.
so
that
the
second
step,
as
we
see
it,
consists
primarily
of
a
determination
that
the
applicant
has
complied
what
the
conditions
of
the
permit.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
substantially,
yes.
that
is
the
point.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
the
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that
is
a
matter
of
interpretation,
your
honor.
we
--
in
our
view
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
say
it
is
a
matter
of
interpretation,
of
course,
as
to
whether
they
can
consider
other
matters.
but
it
is
our
view,
as
i
will
explain
in
greater
detail,
that
both
the
section
185
and
the
regulations
of
the
commission
itself
indicate
that
the
primary
conservation
which
the
commission
should
have
before
at
the
time
that
its
--
permits
operation
to
go
forward
is,
has
the
applicant
conformed
to
the
terms
of
the
construction
permit.
and
if
it
has,
then
the
--
a
permit
to
operate
should
be
granted.
now,
of
course
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
exactly.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
the
government
argues
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
oh,
no,
no.
we
--
we
--
there's
no
such
contention.
our
--
our
position
is
that
they
must
have
a
reasonable
assurance
that
it
can
be
constructed
and
operated
safely.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
government
denies
that
that's
our
--
is
our
contention,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
may
it
please
the
court.
the
greatest
potential
hazard
in
the
operation
of
a
power
reactor
lies
in
the
possibility
that
the
accumulation
of
fission
products,
radioactive
fission
products
imprisoned
in
the
fuel
in
the
course
of
the
operation
of
the
reactor
might
somehow,
including
a
breach
of
the
containment,
that
is
the
shell
that
covers
the
reactor,
be
released
into
the
atmosphere,
be
distributed
by
the
wind
and
contaminate
both
the
land
and
the
--
the
entire
inhabited
area.
these
fission
products
are
more
toxic
than
any
industrially
known
materials
by
a
factor
of
a
million
to
8
billion.
now,
a
report
prepared
for
the
commission
and
presented
in
this
case,
concludes
that
the
possible
damage
from
a
major
accident
in
a
large
nuclear
power
plant
of
a
--
one
of
the
size
of
the
plant
involved
in
this
case,
which
containment
may
go
up
to
$7
billion,
kill
3400
people,
injure
43,000
people
and
lay
waste
to
scores
of
thousands
of
square
miles
of
land.
now,
these
are
not
the
maximum
possibility.
the
same
report
which
provided
these
estimates
stated
also
that
in
special
weather
conditions
which
occur
about
5%
of
the
time
that
if
such
an
accident
occurs
during
such
conditions,
the
damages
would
be
greater,
but
there
is
now,
no
known
way
of
estimating
such
damages.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
is
--
is
your
question
as
to
whether
the
government
can
make
changes?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
don't
argue
--
it
wasn't
the
word
that
that
question
was
raised?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
oh,
no.
no,
i
--
if
i
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
i
--
something
i
said
gave
you
an
impression,
certainly
had
no
such
intention.
it
must
be
understood
that
these
reactors
are
built
pursuant
to
applications
by
private
parties
who
want
to
build
certain
types
of
reactors.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
and
they
asked
for
permission
to
--
for
a
construction
permit
and
they
themselves,
set
forth
the
specifications
of
the
reactor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
and
then
the
--
the
commission
must
determine
whether
or
not,
it
is
satisfied
that
those
specifications
when
will
be
--
provide
a
safe
reactor
before
they
will
--
in
our
view,
before
they
can
issue
a
permit.
now,
the
government
itself,
at
least
not
to
my
knowledge,
will
not
of
its
own
initiative
request
a
change
in
the
specifications.
that
would
come
about
only
if
it
appeared
that
the
specifications
which
the
applicant
prescribed
did
not
provide
a
safe
reactor.
the
--
the
--
very
--
the
consultants,
the
commission
and
so
forth,
may
suggest
that
in
order
to
solve
a
given
safety
question,
certain
things
should
be
done.
it's
not
a
question
of
requiring
the
applicant
to
do
certain
things,
but
of
course,
of
making
suggestions
of
how
to
solve
a
given
safety
problem.
now,
if
the
problem
isn't
solved,
there
will
be
no
--
there
will
be
no
license
presumably,
if
it's
a
--
if
it's
a
major
factor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
so
far
as
i
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
that
the
question
does
not
arise
in
that
way.
i
mean
that
if
a
party
--
an
applicant
wants
to
build
a
given
type
of
reactor,
that's
his
business.
and
the
business
of
the
commission
is
to
determine
whether
that
particular
type
is
safe.
now,
the
commission
may
say
that
particular
type
isn't
safe.
we
will
not
issue
a
license
for
it.
then
it's
up
to
the
applicant
to
go
ahead
and
make
the
changes
which
will
in
the
opinion
of
the
commission,
be
safe
--
allows
safe
operation.
but
the
commission
does
not,
so
far
as
i
know,
i
don't
think
it
--
it
claims
the
authority
of
saying
to
the
applicant,
you
must
make
changes
which
will
change
the
type
for
example
of
the
reactor
that
you
build,
because
we
have
information
which
will
indicate
that
that's
the
best
type
of
reactor.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
they
have
that
authority,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
they
say
we
will
--
we
will
not
--
we
will
not
permit
you
to
operate
this
if
on
the
basis
of
your
plant
as
you
now
have
it,
as
you
have
prepared
it,
built
it,
it
is
not
safe.
but
i
think
it
must
--
this
must
be
borne
in
mind,
the
--
the
construction
permit
sets
forth
the
conditions.
now,
if
the
--
as
we
see
it,
the
--
that
is
why
it
is
essential
that
the
aide
--
that
the
commission
make
a
finding
at
the
start,
before
there
is
an
investment
of
$50
or
$100
million.
it
--
it
is
essential
and
the
law
requires
that
the
commission
make
a
finding
whether
it
issues
the
construction
permit,
with
the
various
conditions
in
that
permit
that
when
the
permit
--
when
the
conditions
are
satisfied,
that
the
applicant
will
be
allowed
to
operate.
now,
that
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
that
we
say
is
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
in
our
view,
that
is
not
in
the
contemplation
of
the
law.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
it
is
our
view
that
the
--
that
congress
intended
that
once
a
construction
permit
was
granted,
the
applicant
does
not
go
forward
at
his
peril.
he
is
not
asked
to
spend
the
$100
million
and
then
be
told
that
we
have
--
we
--
we
can
change
it
as
we
see
fit,
because
we
--
after
all,
we
did
make
any
finding
on
the
question
of
safety.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
the
commission
says,
it
is
not
obliged
to
do
so.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
in
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
yes.
but
the
law
also
contemplates
that
the
necessary
finding
would
be
made
prior
to
the
time
construction
began.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but
they
didn't
make
the
finding,
your
honor,
(voice
overlap)
that's
--
that's
the
problem.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
they
have
complied
with
the
construction
permit.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
cannot
ask
--
answer
the
question
by
a
yes
or
no,
because
the
--
the
law,
the
regulations
say,
"you
must
comply
with
the
conditions
of
the
construction
permit."
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
mr.
--
mr.
justice
franker,
i
fairly
understand
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
don't
understand
your
question
then,
because
that
determination
cannot
be
made
until
construction
is
completed.
no,
if
i
understand
your
question,
it
is
if
the
commission
has
complied
with
the
law
now,
they
must
give
them
--
permit
them
to
operate.
that's
only
half
of
the
matter.
the
applicant
must
go
forward
and
complete
construction.
now,
if
your
question
is
that
on
the
basis
of
the
present
permit
in
this
case,
if
the
applicant
goes
forward
and
completes
construction
on
the
basis
of
those
conditions,
yes,
then
it
is
our
answer
that
the
commission
is
obliged
to
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
same
formula.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
the
same
formula,
that
is
that
we
--
at
the
time
of
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that
is
the
question.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
the
--
if
the
construction
conditions
were
met,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
mr.
justice
black,
the
finding
that
we
say
is
required
appears
in
the
middle
of
that
the
paragraph.
you
see
that
there
are
two
findings
indicated
in
that
paragraph.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
first
finding
which
we
say
was
not
complied
--
was
not
made
was
the
one
that
appears
in
the
beginning
of
that
section.
if
the
commission
is
satisfied
that
it
has
information
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
a
facility
of
a
general
type
proposed
can
be
constructed
and
operate
--
operated
at
the
proposed
location
without
under
risk
for
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public,
it
may
process
the
application.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
we
say
they
have
not
made
it.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
not
possible.
no,
what
i
mean
is
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
this
is
intended
for
construction
permits.
this
--
well,
this
applies
only
through
construction
permits,
this
--
this
requirement
that
i
have
just
read.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.
it
is
not
an
enough
because
that
is
made
prior
to
the
time
that
it's
supposed
to
be
made,
prior
to
the
time
that
construction
begins.
now,
the
commission
does
not
--
does
not
ask
to
assume
that
the
applicant
is
going
to
comply
with
all
of
the
conditions
of
a
construction
permit.
so,
that
when
they
have
completed
construction,
then
you
get
down
to
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph
and
then,
the
commission
makes
an
evaluation
of
the
situation
at
the
time
that
the
construction
is
completed
and
then
the
--
it
must
determine
as
the
language
there
says,
does
the
final
design
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public
will
not
be
endangered.
now,
that
--
we
say
then.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
because
the
construction
hasn't
been
completed
yet.
they
haven't
got
to
that
point
yet.
you
see
our
--
our
position
is
--
is
this
provides
in
accordance
with
the
law
as
--
as
agrees
a
two-step
procedure.
first,
the
construction
pursuant
to
a
construction
--
to
an
issuance
of
a
construction
permit
and
then
after
the
construction
is
completed
in
accordance
with
those
conditions,
then
a
determination
whether
or
not
those
conditions
had
been
fulfilled.
and
if
they
are
fulfilled
and
the
commission
then
makes
a
finding
that
the
final
design
will
provide
--
will
make
reasonable
assurance
for
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public,
then
they
are
permitted
to
operate.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
alright.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
oh,
i
never
said
that.
that's
the
contention
of
the
--
of
the
petitioners.
we
never
claimed
that
this
first
finding
is
enough
to
permit
them
to
operate
after
it's
--
after
it's
finished.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
their
briefs
claim
that
we
said
that.
and
we
--
we
have
never
done
it.
they
--
they
make
the
claim
as
you're
applying
through
their
briefs
that
we
have
said
that
the
commission
was
to
make.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
sir.
yes.
now,
we
have
never
said
and
we
do
not
claim
that
this
finding
which
is
made
at
the
time
the
construction
permit
is
issued
is
the
only
finding
that
is
required
if
before
the
--
the
reactor
can
be
operated.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right,
we
say
this
finding.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
the
substantially
the
basis
of
the
argument.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
we
are
wrong,
then
this
construction
permit
was
validly
issued.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
they
had
issued
it.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
then
--
then
we
have
no
case.
if
they
had
made
the
findings
which
the
law
and
their
--
and
their
regulations
require,
then
that
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
this
is
one
of
them.
this
is
--
this
is
the
principal
one,
yes,
section
--
reg.
50.35.
now,
we
say
they
have
not
made
this
first
finding.
not
only
have
they
not
made
it,
the
--
there's
no
question
they
haven't
made
it
in
the
words
of
this
--
of
the
section.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
we
say
they
have
not
made
it
in
substance
either.
that's
right.
and
therefore,
this
--
this
--
permit
is
invalidly
issued
and
the
court
then
below
ordered
a
remand
to
the
commission
for
further
examination.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
not
in
words.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
not
in
words,
that's
right.
so
far
as
the
regulation
requires,
the
words
are
the
same.
now,
if
you
say
that
perhaps
the
content
of
a
conviction
is
different,
then
i
don't
know
if
we
can
answer
into
the
minds
of
the
--
of
the
commissioners,
but
so
far
as
the
words
are
concerned,
they
are
the
same.
now,
let
me
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
that's
the
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
--
to
the
duty
of
assurance?
yes,
we
--
yes,
of
course,
by
that
time
--
by
the
time
that
the
--
that
the
reactor
is
constructed,
then
they
have
the
whole
thing
before
them
and
they
make
the
tests
to
determine
if
it
will
be
safe.
but
the
question
then
is,
is
the
reactor
that
we
have
before
us
or
doesn't
provide
adequate
assurance
that
during
operation,
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public
will
not
be
endangered?
now,
prior
to
the
time
that
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
that
was
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
obviously
because
then
--
they
have
--
there
has
been
a
--
a
completion
of
the
reactors,
so
they
see
it
before
even
when
they
have
tested
it.
now,
in
--
in
that
sense,
of
course,
they
are
different.
while
i
was
directing
my
response,
i
thought
your
question
was
to
the
matter
of
what
constitutes
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
is
there
a
difference
in
reasonable
assurance?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
on
reasonable
assurance,
as
what
i
was
directing
my
response
to.
the
--
the
--
initially,
as
--
as
we
see
it
and
as
this
language
states,
the
commission
should
make
--
is
required
as
we
see
it
to
make
your
finding
on
the
basis
of
information
it
has
at
that
time
that
when
the
reactor
will
be
completed.
it
will
operate
in
a
manner
which
will
be
provided
adequate
protection
for
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
now,
when
the
reactor
is
completed,
it
hasn't
yet
operated.
but
nevertheless,
there
is
more
information
before
in
the
--
in
the
form
of
a
completed
reactor.
then
they
must
make
another
determination
that
when
this
reactor
is
operated,
it
will
provide
adequate
protection
to
--
for
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
even
at
that
point
has
--
it
has
not
actually
operated,
but
it
has
been
completed
and
it
--
it
has
undergone
some
tests,
so
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
34
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
they're
--
they
are
relying,
your
honor
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
precisely.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
and
under
the
regulation.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that
--
that
we
say
they
have
not
done.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
master
finding
is
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
and
we
say
they
have
not
done
it
--
even
22
contains
that
qualification,
namely
that
it's
for
the
purposes
of
the
provisional
construction
permit.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
finding
--
if
that
were
the
only
change,
it
would
certainly
improve
this
finding.
yes,
it
would
then
be
in
the
--
in
the
in
the
term
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
it
would
not
be
adequate
in
the
--
in
view
of
the
opinion
that
we
will
get
to
that.
but
assuming
that
the
opinions
were
modified
so
as
to
eliminate
the
references
to
danger
during
construction,
then
this
would
be
adequate,
yes.
but
our
position
is
that
the
explanation
particularly
of
what
the
commission
was
doing
as
revealed
in
its
opinion,
as
shown
by
the
basis
on
which
it
acted
that
fundamentally,
they
were
considering
danger
during
construction
rather
than
operation.
now,
that
is
basically
our
--
our
first
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
that's
correct.
but
i
didn't
understand
them
to
say
that,
but
if
they
said
that
that
would
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
know
that
--
that
would
--
that
is
the
essence,
if
the
states
are
positioned
here.
now,
i
want
to
make
clear
that
we
do
not
--
are
not
asserting
on
the
safety
question
that
there
is
a
danger
on
an
atomic
bomb
explosion
or
explosion
like
an
atomic
bomb
here.
that
the
--
the
danger
arises
from
the
issuance
of
gasses
through
the
flues
and
the
stacks
and
the
possible
rupture
of
the
containment.
now,
that
is
where
the
major
danger
arises.
and
for
example,
a
--
an
accident
occurred,
the
reactor
in
england,
the
windscale
reactor
on
october
1957,
a
small
reactor
than
the
one
here.
and
it
resulted
in
a
passage
of
radioactive
gasses
through
the
chimney.
now,
the
leading
physical
--
physicist,
nuclear
scientist
of
great
britain
declared
that
this
accident
released
considerably
more
radioactivity,
then
is
released
during
a
--
an
explosion
of
an
atomic
bomb
of
a
hiroshima
type.
now,
we're
not
saying
that
this
caused
the
damage
that
that
bomb
caused
because
there
was
no
blast
or
fire.
but
so
far
as
radioactivity
itself
is
concerned,
a
--
an
accident
in
the
reactor
of
this
type
will
cause
that
kind
of
radio
actual
--
equivalent
to
that
of
a
large
atomic
bomb.
now,
that's
the
nature
of
the
problem
we
have
before
us.
now,
this
was
outlined
--
this
was
emphasized
by
the
fact
that
the
insurance
industry
of
the
united
states
would
not
provide
the
insurance
that
was
indicated
for
this
type
of
accident.
the
entire
insurance
industry
of
the
united
states
would
provide
only
$60
million
public
liability
insurance
for
a
reactor
accident,
with
the
result
that
in
order
to
promote
the
building
of
reactors,
the
united
states
adopted
an
indemnity
provision
in
the
atomic
--
in
the
act
of
1954,
by
amendment
in
1957,
providing
for
an
indemnity
of
$500
million
for
a
single
accident.
that
is
what
the
law
now
provides,
$500
million
indemnity
that
united
states
will
pay
over
and
above
the
amount
of
insurances
that
will
be
paid
by
the
private
companies,
for
the
results
of
a
single
accident.
now,
i
think
that
that
in
itself
indicates
the
enormity
of
the
problem
and
the
horrendous
consequences
of
an
accident
and
the
enormous
responsibility
that
rests
upon
the
commission.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
sir.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
you
mean
in
this
case?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
in
this
case,
they
were
proposed
locations
as
the
--
has
the
name
of
laguna
beach,
michigan.
it's
a
--
on
the
lake
about
30
miles
from
detroit,
michigan
and
also
about
the
same
distance
from
toledo,
ohio.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
about
30
miles.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
from
detroit
and
about
the
same
distance
from
toledo.
and
within
a
30-mile
radius
of
this
location,
the
--
there
are
about
two
million
people
living.
now,
that
is
the
--
what
the
record
indicates
of
the
--
what
may
be
considered
the
immediate
area
which
would
be
involved
in
the
event
of
an
accident.
now,
before
going
into
the
discussion
of
the
law,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
point
out,
in
which
--
whether
there
is
--
a
respect
in
which
the
commission
is
extraordinarily
unique.
there
is
no
other
agency
so
far
as
i
know
which
combines
two
conflicting
functions
namely,
promotion
and
regulation.
with
the
adoption
of
the
act
of
1954,
this
is
what
has
occurred
with
the
atomic
energy
commission.
on
the
one
hand,
it
must
--
it
is
given
the
responsibility
of
promoting
the
development
of
the
peaceful
uses
of
atomic
energy,
particularly
reactors.
and
with
the
other,
it
must
regulate
and
determine
whether
or
not
these
are
safe.
this
is
in
effect
like
asking
an
operator
on
automobile
to
drive
on
one
foot
on
the
accelerator
and
one
foot
on
the
brake
at
the
same
time.
now
that
i
--
i
submit
there's
an
invitation
to
schizophrenia.
now,
this
is
the
problem
that
the
commission
has.
now,
consider
what
was
actually
done
in
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
aviation,
the
safety
responsibility
is
primarily
with
the
federal
aviation
agency,
the
cab
is
concerned
with
the
--
with
promotion.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
well,
now
we're
talking
about
the
safety.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
and
--
and
this
of
course
--
that
the
only
area
in
which
the
atomic
energy
commission
has
regulatory
functions
namely
with
respect
to
safety
and
security.
now,
in
this
case,
the
commission
negotiated
with
prdc,
prior
to
the
time
that
the
permit
was
even
applied
for
or
to
help
prdc
develop
this
reactor
and
then
the
license
--
the
--
the
construction
permit
was
issued
and
while
the
hearing
was
going
on
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
construction
permit
was
properly
issued,
the
commission
entered
into
a
contract
with
prdc.
they
spent
four
--
over
$4
million
with
the
purpose
of
research
and
development
of
that
reactor.so
that
they
have
the
--
they
have
been
--
they
were
assuming
then
the
function
of
promoting
this
particular
reactor.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
while
this
proceedings
go
on
and
now,
the
commission
is
in
constant
consultation
with
the
--
with
prdc
to
help
--
help
it
out
and
give
whatever
advice
it
can
presumably
and
give
it
guidance,
all
for
the
purpose
of
course
and
we
don't
say
this
is
illegitimate,
of
promoting
the
development
of
the
industry.
now,
we
think
that
this
--
this
essential
conflict
of
interest,
we
submit,
is
a
matter
which
should
be
taken
in
consideration
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
in
determining
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
interpretations
and
the
findings.
now,
this
we
think
this
double
--
this
double
function
is
--
must
have
as
we
see
it,
a
very
substantial
impact
on
the
way
in
which
the
commission
actually
handles
the
determination
of
the
regulatory
phases
of
its
responsibility.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
we
are
not
attacking
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
for
example,
the
--
some
argument
is
made
here
to
the
effect
that
the
usual
--
that
rules
with
respect
to
getting
weight
to
the
administrative
interpretations
of
a
law
should
be
applied
here.
we
say
that
that
--
that
principle
is
substantially
weakened
in
this
particular
case,
because
you
have
here
the
--
a
conflicting
approaches
of
the
commission
in
determining
whether
they
should
give
a
--
a
certain
interpretation
which
were
to
promote
--
which
would
help
their
promotional
activities
and
one
which
would
help
their
regulatory
activities.
so
we
say
that
--
we
point
this
out
because
this
conflict
of
function
which
is
so
--
so
deeply
imbedded
in
the
--
the
structure
and
the
functions
of
the
atomic
energy
commission.
now,
we're
not
suggesting
that
anything
they've
done
is
illegal
on
that
account,
but
we
think
it
must
be
--
it
must
be
a
matter
which
should
be
borne
in
mind.
for
example,
just
to
conclude
this
one
point,
in
mr.
wolman's
testimony
whose
one
of
the
members
of
acrs
and
who
testified
in
this
case.
this
is
volume
3
of
the
--
of
the
record
on
page
866.
he
states
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in
general,
it
is
apt
to
be
true
that
the
proponents
of
a
particular
reactor
fill
the
highest
degree
of
optimism
regarding
both
the
machine
and
its
sight,
while
those
most
directly
concerned
with
the
protection
of
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public,
demonstrate
a
less
degree
of
optimism.
this
jacks
the
petition
--
jacks
the
position
of
judgments
is
neither
unfamiliar
nor
unexpected.
historically,
it
accounts
with
the
fact
that
site
locations
for
industries
of
more
familiar
and
normal
characteristics
usually
have
external
review
by
public
regulatory
agencies.
this
situation
has
arisen
not
so
much
because
of
any
philosophical
difference
of
opinion,
but
because
experience
has
shown
that
industry
is
not
always
the
best
judge
of
the
disability
which
it
might
create
for
the
public.
now,
here,
you
have
in
the
--
in
the
atomic
energy
commission,
some
of
this
disability
which
dr.
wolman
has
indicated,
industry
might
have
under
some
more
circumstances.
now,
this
is
a
very
serious
problem
and
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
because
we
think
that
this
is
in
effect,
sitting
on
both
sides
of
the
table
your
honor.
on
the
one
hand
as
the
petitioner
said
there,
the
object
of
the
commission
is
to
get
reactors
built,
to
promote
them,
to
see
that
the
civilian
use
of
atomic
energy
is
given
as
much
emphasis
as
possible.
on
the
other
hand,
it's
also
the
function
of
the
same
agency
to
say
that
you
cannot
go
ahead
unless
all
safety
precautions
have
been
taken.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well
yes.
it
is
--
it's
one
their
functions
and
what
the
--
and
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
it
may
be
your
honor.
it's
a
matter
of
judgement
of
course.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
that
of
course
a
--
a
matter
of
for
congress,
that's
true.
and
then
the
congress
is
now
in
the
course
of
reexamining
this
situation,
but
we
think
it's
a
matter
which
ought
--
ought
to
be
borne
in
mind,
in
determining
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
commission's
interpretations.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
if
may
go
on
to
the
matter
of
what
the
law
provides.
now,
the
commission
--
well,
rather
the
petitioners
here,
the
government
particularly,
has
asserted
that
the
standards
are
to
be
found
--
the
standards
for
the
issuance
of
licenses
are
to
be
found
in
section
104.
now,
that
in
using
the
government's
brief,
that
would
be
on
page
111.
now,
they
claimed
that
the
standard
appears
in
this
section.
now,
the
--
the
language
relied
upon
is
as
follows,
"in
issuing
of
licenses
under
this
subsection,
the
commission
shall
impose
the
minimum
amount
of
such
regulations
and
terms
of
license
as
will
permit
the
commission
to
fulfill
its
obligations
under
this
act
to
promote
the
common
defense
and
security
and
to
protect
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public."
what
is
--
what
it
is
saying
there
is
that
the
terms
of
the
license
and
regulation
shall
be
of
this
nature.
the
--
the
section
itself
does
not
say
what
--
what
any
finding
shall
be
as
we
see
it.
the
regulation
itself
does
not
set
forth
the
standards.
this
is
in
effect
saying
that
the
commission
shall
establish
the
standards.
now,
there
can
be
little
question,
we
submit
that
this
is
in
fact
how
both
the
commission
and
the
government
petitioners
actually
construe
their
powers
under
this
act.
now,
for
example,
on
page
40
and
41
of
the
government's
brief,
they
say
the
government
--
the
congress
gave
the
commission
--
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
"the
congress
gave
the
commission
broad
power
to
establish
requirements
that's
so
you
protect
life,
health
and
property,
in
the
development
and
use
of
atomic
energy
for
peaceful
purposes."
the
very
breadth
of
the
phrases
demonstrates
that
the
commission's
delegated
authority
encompasses
the
entire
spectrum
of
health
and
safety
regulation,
the
formulation
of
policies,
the
evaluation
of
scientific
information,
the
fixing
of
standards
and
their
application
just
be
of
the
cases.
now,
this
we
submit,
is
a
statement
in
effect
saying,
this
--
the
--
that
there
is
no
limit
to
the
discretion
of
the
agency
on
page
50
of
the
same
brief.
it
has
said
this
--
this
is
--
this
language
appears
at
about
the
middle
of
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
at
the
middle
of
the
page.
"the
absence
of
specific
standards
governing
the
grant
of
construction
permits
was
evidently
designed
to
give
the
commission
the
broadest
discretion
in
formulating
appropriate
safety
standards
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding."
now
that
we
submit,
means
there
are
no
limits
on
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
now,
the
commission
itself
has
taken
a
similar
position.
for
example,
on
page
642
of
the
record,
that
would
be
volume
2
in
its
opinion.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
in
effect
your
honor,
it
appears
to
us
that
they're
saying
there
are
no
limits
placed
by
the
law
on
the
discretion
of
the
agency.
that
they,
in
effect,
do
not
have
to
make
any
findings
and
they
say.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well
that's
our
construction
of
what
they
--
what
they
have
said.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
what
i
have
just
read
--
what
i
have
just
read
from
their
briefs.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
pardon?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
broadest
discretion.
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
broadest
discretion
is,
your
honor.
they
haven't
--
that's
as
far
as
their
language
goes.
but
may
i
call
your
attention
to
beginning
at
the
--
the
sentence
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
in
recognition
--
on
page
642
of
the
record.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
in
recognition
of
this
point,
our
rules
are
designed
to
provide
for
commission
determination
of
a
form
and
construction
and
scope
of
a
construction
permit
preliminary
to
a
section
104
license
as
appropriate
in
a
particular
case
depending
on
the
particular
state
of
research
and
development
currently
available
to
the
proposed
project.
we
say
that
--
the
commission
says
we
--
this
language,
in
effect,
means
that
they
have
the
discretion
to
do
as
they
see
fit
to
--
to
establish
any
standards
they
see
fit.
or
in
--
as
it
applies
in
this
case,
they
do
not
have
to
make
a
finding
at
the
--
at
the
time
the
construction
permit
is
issued
or
any
other
time
prior
to
the
actual
--
the
actual
operation
of
that
there
will
be
safe
operation.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
language
is
so
broad
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
act,
nothing
in
this
language,
which
can
be
point
to
do
as
saying,
they
even
have
to
make
a
finding
at
the
time
they
authorized
operation.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
we
don't
do
either.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
we
say
that
104
is
not
the
pertinent
section.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
we're
not
claiming
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
not
the
--
not
the
regulation
as
written,
but
the
regulation
as
applied.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
as
written,
no.
as
written,
we
are
not
attacking
the
regulation
in
the
briefs.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
exactly,
yes.
they
have
not
applied
this
type
of
standard,
we
say
is
required.
now,
if
i
may
get
to
the
statutory
standard,
then
i
will
get
to
the
regulation.
now,
the
statutory
standard,
where
construction
permits
as
we
see
it,
is
contained
in
section
182
and
185
of
the
act.
now
--
perhaps
i'd
better
use
the
--
in
--
in
our
--
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
93,
appears
section
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
185
of
the
respondents'
brief.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
section
182
states,
"each
license
application
for
a
license
hereunder
shall
contain
certain
information."
and
the
second
sentence
says
--
reads
as
follows,
"in
connection
with
applications
for
licenses
to
operate
production
or
utilization
facilities,
the
applicant
shall
state
such
technical
specifications,
including
information
of
the
amount,
kind
and
source
special
nuclear
material
required,
the
place
of
the
use,
the
specific
characteristics
of
the
facility,
and
such
other
information
as
the
commission
made,
by
rule
or
regulation,
deem
necessary
in
order
to
enable
it
to
find
that
the
utilization
or
protection
--
production
of
special
nuclear
material
will
be
in
accord
with
common
defense
and
security
and
will
provide
adequate
protection
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public."
that
we
say
is
the
statutory
standard.
now,
the
question
is,
does
this
supply
to
construction
permits?
but
this
you
say,
it
does
not.
we
say
it
does
apply
to
construction
permits.
now,
this
act
is
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
alright.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
if
--
if
by
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
they
revised
--
if
they
revised
their
finding
to
making
any
finding
of
safety
with
respect
to
operation,
then
it
would
be
alright.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
they
left
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
if
they
left
out
that
qualification
and
with
--
along
with
the
qualifications
that
appear
in
the
opinion,
then
we
say
that
would
be
all
the
--
permit
would
be
alright.
but
we
say
that
these
findings
along
with
the
explanations
of
the
findings
that
appear
in
the
opinion,
show
very
clearly
that
the
commission
did
not
apply
that
finding
to
the
operational
stage
and
at
the
very
best
are
so
--
are
so
confused
and
so
obscure
that
the
--
the
opinion
and
the
decision
does
not
clearly
state
at
the
very
best,
what
the
basis
of
the
commission's
action
was.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
and
we
say
that
is
what
congress
contemplated
and
that
in
effect,
we
say
also
is
what
their
own
regulation
contemplates,
as
written,
but
not
however,
as
applied
in
this
case.
alright
now,
it
--
the
term,
license,
by
virtue
of
the
statute
itself
and
this
appears
in
the
last
sentence
of
section
185,
which
appears
at
the
top
of
page
95
of
our
brief
says,
"for
all
other
purposes
of
this
act,
the
construction
permit
is
deemed
to
be
a
license."
now,
i
get
that
in
the
introductory
phrase,
"but
for
purposes
of
a
reactor,
the
term,
license,
in
the
--
is
--
covers
both
the
--
the
end
result
as
well
as
the
construction
permit."
now,
it
is
our
position
that
this
language
does
not
refer
--
does
not
limit
section
182
to
the
actual
license
to
operate.
all
that
is
referring
to
is
to
the
application,
not
to
the
license.
now,
that
is
how
the
commission
itself
interpreted
this
matter,
now,
to
--
in
the
regulations
which
it
adopted.
now,
let
me
point
out
how
--
why
it
is
clear
that
the
commission
did
so
construe
the
act
and
--
and
adopts
the
regulations
pursuant
thereto.
if
you'll
note
on
page
96
of
our
brief,
regulation
50.34,
now
that
refers
to
the
technical
qualifications
that
are
required
in
the
application.
now,
50.34
sets
forth
all
in
--
in
much
greater
detail,
but
the
--
the
same
--
the
same
type
of
detail
as
section
182
calls
for,
all
of
these
technical
aspects.
now,
the
commission's
own
regulations
provide
that
this
information
must
be
in
the
application
for
a
construction
permit.
they
say
so,
and
this
is
found
in
section
50.45
of
the
--
the
commission's
regulations
and
50.45
is
in
the
record
at
page
644.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
oh
yes,
i
will
get
--
they
filled
out
the
application,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
they
supplied
information.
the
question
is
was
it
adequate?
but
they
did
fill
out
the
forms.
and
--
but
the
point
i
am
now
getting
to
is
that
the
commission
interpreted
this
section
182
and
the
requirement
for
information
to
apply
to
construction
permits.
now,
if
you
will
look
at
page
644,
you'll
note
in
the
footnote,
page
644.
standards
for
construction
permit,
section
50.45,
"an
applicant
for
a
license
or
an
amendment
of
a
license
who
proposes
to
construct
or
alter
a
production
or
utilization
facility,
will
be
initially
granted
a
construction
permit,
if
the
application
is
in
conformity
with
and
acceptable
under
the
criteria
of
sections
50.31
through
50.38
and
the
standards
of
50.40
through
50.43."
of
course,
section
50.34
is
obviously
included
with
that
--
in
that
number.
so
it
is
apparent
that
the
requirements
that
since
--
which
the
section
182
makes
and
which
are
incorporated
in
the
regulation,
are
intended
for
construction
permits.
and
so,
the
commission
itself
has
held,
acted
on
and
pursued
in
the
administration
of
the
act.
now
in
this
case,
that
was
--
what
happened
was,
this
happens
in
every
other
situation.
the
application
was
for
a
permit
to
construct
and
operate.
at
page
364
of
the
record,
appears
the
original
application
for
license,
that's
volume
2.
the
very
first
paragraph
states,
"we
are
submitting
here
with
our
application
for
a
plus
104
license
to
build,
own
and
operate
a
developmental
fast-neutron
breeder
reactor."
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
which
provides
for
a
separate
application
to
operate
and
for
a
permit
to
operate.
the
--
the
applications
are
the
same.
if
the
one
application
that
is
made
at
the
beginning,
for
a
permit
to
construct
and
to
operate
and
that
is
what
is
--
the
information
must
be
presented
at
that
time.
and
our
position
is
that
section
182
says
that
the
information
must
be
sufficient
to
--
to
enable
the
commission
to
find
that
when
the
issues
the
--
the
license
that
it
will
be
--
it
will
be
adequate
protection
for
health
and
safety.
and
license
of
course,
includes
construction
permit
as
these
regulations
indicate.
now,
going
over
to
section
185
of
the
act
which
relates
to
construction
permits,
now
--
that's
on
page
94
of
our
brief.
this
says,
"all
applicants
for
licenses
to
construct
or
modify
production
or
utilization
facility,
shall
if
the
application
is
otherwise
acceptable
on
the
commission,
they
initially
granted
a
construction
permit."
it
is
evident
that
licensees
to
construct
are
broader
than
nearly
for
a
construction
permit
because
it
says
initially
on
such
applications
a
construction
permit
shall
be
granted.
then
it
goes
on
--
sets
forth
that
--
if
it
is
granted
then,
the
--
the
construction
must
--
when
construction
is
completed
pursuant
to
the
conditions
of
the
permit,
then
upon
finding
that
the
facility
authorized
has
been
constructed
and
will
operate
in
conformity
with
the
application
in
accordance
for
the
rules
and
regulation
and
absent
of
finding
of
good
cause
to
the
contrary,
the
license
--
the
commission
shall
thereupon
issue
a
license
to
the
applicant.
now,
as
we
see
it,
this
makes
it
obligatory
on
the
commission
to
issue
a
license
or
to
permit
the
operation
once
the
conditions
of
the
construction
permit
have
been
complied
with.
it
shall
issue
a
license.
now,
it
would
certainly
not
in
the
contemplation
of
congress
which
was
so
concerned
about
health
and
safety,
that
it
repeated
the
injunction
on
--
on
this
matter
about
20
times
during
the
course
of
the
act.
that
they
would
--
they
would
provide
that
the
license
shall
be
issued
if
the
construction
permit
--
if
the
conditions
are
met,
unless
the
--
the
initial
finding
and
safety
had
already
been
made.
then
it
says,
"it
shall
thereupon
issue
a
license
to
the
applicant
for
all
other
purposes
of
this
act,
a
construction
permit
is
deemed
to
be
a
license."
now,
that
clearly
refers
to
the
use
of
license
in
the
preceding
sentence.
license
there
refers
to
the
--
to
the
culmination
of
the
process.
obviously,
a
construction
permit
isn't
the
culmination
of
the
process.
so
except
for
what
is
stated
in
the
very
last
--
the
end
of
that
sentence,
construction
license,
wherever
it
appears
with
relationship
to
reactors,
applies
to
construction
permits
as
well
as
to
the
permission
to
operate.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
if
the
--
as
far
as
the
conditions
of
the
construction
permit
would
of
course
require
that
the
--
that
the
reactor
be
built
and
operated.
of
course,
it
would
be
that
finding
and
safety
and
with
respect
to
operation.
now,
that
of
course
is
the
function
of
the
commission.
if
it
cannot
find,
now
this
is
--
this
is
of
course
a
very
heavy
responsibility,
but
it
is
our
view
that
the
--
that
the
dangers
here
are
so
terrible,
that
if
the
commission
cannot
find
at
the
time
that
it
issues
a
construction
permit
that
it
would
be
safe,
then
we
--
safely
operated,
that
it
cannot
issue
the
permit.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
now
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that
--
oh
yes,
at
that
location.
certainly,
i
will
get
to
the
location
--
that
question
again
soon.
but
it
must
be
at
the
proposed
location,
no
question.
alright
now,
if
--
certainly,
if
it
appears
that
the
commission
--
to
the
commission
subsequently,
that
its
initial
decision
was
erroneous,
do
i
--
is
that
the
question,
your
honor?
if
they
find
--
if
they
feel
that
they
were
--
improbably
made
a
finding
of
safety,
what
can
they
do?
i'm
--
i
--
is
--
was
that
your
question?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
but
this
--
if
i
understood
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
point
was
supposed
they
had
made
a
mistake
initially
and
made
appointing
of
safety
and
subsequently
learned
that
it
will
not
be.
now,
that
is
quite
a
different
situation
from
saying
--
from
giving
him
the
permit
to
go
ahead
without
having
made
any
--
an
adequate
finding
of
safety
of
operation
at
the
proposed
location.
now,
i
think
that's
a
--
that's
a
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
true.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
the
difference
--
the
difference
is
very
fundamental,
your
honor.
certainly,
in
this
respect
and
it's
highlighted
by
the
legislative
history
which
we
go
into
in
considerable
extent.
during
the
discussions
of
the
matter
on
--
particularly
on
the
senate
floor,
it
was
pointed
out
and
there
was
no
challenge
to
the
argument
made
by
senators
humphrey
and
jackson,
that
if
there
--
once
a
construction
permit
is
issued
and
very
substantial
amounts
of
money
are
spent
pursuant
to
the
permit
to
operate,
that
the
pressures
on
the
commission
to
grant
a
permission
to
operate
might
well
be
irresistible,
so
that
in
order
to
avoid
such
dangers,
it
was
necessary
to
make
the
--
the
finding
and
safety
at
the
beginning.
so
that
by
the
time
the
--
the
construction
is
completed
in
accordance
with
the
conditions
of
the
permit,
such
a
problem
wouldn't
arise.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
sorry.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
if
the
hazard
would
be
very
greatly
reduced,
certainly
at
the
very
least,
it
would
be
minimized
to
a
very
substantial
extent.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.
you
can't
get
rid
of
it,
but
you
could
at
least
make
only
--
what
the
law
requires
and
with
adequate
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
we
make
that
presumption
with
respect
to
every
agency,
your
honor.
and
in
this
court,
and
other
courts
have
found
many
times
that
agencies
--
that
the
agencies
staffed
by
men
of
honor
and
integrity
and
competence,
don't
just
to
the
law
properly,
or
even
their
own
regulation.
now,
the
--
the
problem
of
safety
is
so
--
is
so
enormous
that
congress
was
intent
on
seeing
that
the
very
greatest
say
--
precautions
be
taken
and
one
of
these
precautions
and
certainly
had
basic
precaution
was
that
you
don't
allow
people
to
go
ahead
and
build
and
spend
enormous
sums
of
money
in
this
case
in
excess
of
$80
million
and
say,
when
you
finished
and
spent
all
this
money,
then
we'll
decide
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
this
is
in
the
legislative
history
and
we
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
40
--
begins
at
page
39
and
going
there
through
the
page
42,
43.
and
the
court
below,
it
was
accepted
that
interpretation.
the
--
this
legislative
history
assuring
what
was
the
intent
and
the
--
for
the
interpretation
particularly
at
sections
182
and
185
and
just
question
of
influence.
now
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
a
very
substantial
amount
of
discretion
is
required,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
there's
no
question,
but
certainly
the
history
of
this
land
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no.there's
one
other
protection,
your
honor.
that's
the
standards
which
the
law
imposed.
now
we
say
this
--
the
standards
are
imposed.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
but
there
is
a
difference
in
your
honor
please,
as
to
what
the
standard
is
when
it
is
to
be
applied.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
there
would
have
been
no
construction
permit
in
this
case.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
now,
there
might
have
an
issue
the
year
later
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
--
two
years
later,
three
years
later,
but
it
would
not
have
been
issued
at
the
time,
because
the
information
wasn't
available.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
it's
where
is
remanded
the
case
to
the
commission.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
because
it
didn't
make
the
next
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
to
make
the
necessary
safety
findings.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
oh,
no.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
possibly.
and
they
possibly
might
have
found
that
they
didn't
exist
too,
your
honor
and
withdraw
the
permit
entirely.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
quite
possible,
but
that
still
doesn't
excuse
the
commission.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
that's
involved,
but
you've
never
will
go
back
to
the
commission.
the
commission
would
have
to
reexamine
the
information
available
and
then
say
whether
or
not,
he
has
information
sufficient
to
warrant
it.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
no,
your
honor.
not
the
same
findings.
they
shouldn't
--
they
cannot
--
they
are
not
authorized
to
make
a
finding
for
purposes
of
a
traditional
construction
permit.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
alright.
the
absence
of
that
then,
if
they
made
the
finding
that
they
have
information
sufficient,
had
in
the
present
tense,
information
sufficient
to
say
that
the
operator
--
that
the
reactor
can
be
operated
at
the
proposed
site,
then
they
--
it
would
be
proper,
certainly.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
you.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
this
is
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i
don't
agree.
now,
may
i
point
out
--
may
i
point
out
why
it
is
so
clear
that
the
commission
did
not
have
that
intention
what
--
at
all,
at
the
time
that
had
issued
this
permit?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
reimburse
for
what?
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
i'm
not
aware
of
any
such
proposition.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that
would
have
been
one
way,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
yes.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
that's
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
that's
right.
now,
well
now,
this
--
the
--
the
colloquy
at
which
developed
as
this
record
shows
is
that
when
--
when
senator
humphrey
made
that
argument,
senator
hickenlooper
who
was
managing
the
bill
said,
"well,
that's
just
what
the
law
provides.
and
therefore,
your
amendment
isn't
necessary."
and
here's
the
point
why
--
as
and
senator
hickenlooper
said,
that
a
license
and
a
construction
permit
are
equivalent,
they
are
the
same
thing
and
one
cannot
operate
until
the
other
is
granted.
that
may
have
been
an
infelicitous
statement,
but
that's
how
the
senator
hickenlooper,
the
manager
of
the
bill
stated
it.
and
that
--
in
this
was
--
was
reference
to
whether
or
not
section
182
applied
to
construction
permits.
that
was
the
purport
of
the
colloquy.
and
senator
hickenlooper
said,
yes.
therefore,
the
amendment
wasn't
required.
and
that
of
course,
imposed
the
safety
standard
for
the
issuance
of
construction
permit
and
the
purpose
of
that
was
to
assure
that
the
--
that
the
point
that
we
--
that
was
--
i
just
made.
now,
with
respect
to
what
the
actual
interpretation
by
the
commission
itself
of
its
own
findings
and
function
in
this
case,
i
direct
your
attention
to
section
regulation
50.40
which
appears
on
page
98
of
our
brief.
now,
this
is
called
common
standards.
in
determining
that
a
license
will
be
issued
to
an
applicant,
the
commission
will
be
guided
by
the
following
considerations.
and
(a)
says
the
processes
to
be
performed,
the
operating
procedures,
the
facility
and
equipment,
the
use
of
the
facility
and
other
technical
specifications
or
the
proposals
in
regard
thereto,
ending
up
that
--
for
the
--
so
that
the
health
and
safety
to
public
will
not
be
endangered.
now,
i
submit
that
on
place
of
this
language,
it
is
clear
that
it
relates
to
the
operational
period.
otherwise,
the
language
makes
no
sense.
the
processes
to
be
performed,
the
operating
procedures,
the
use
of
the
facility
and
so
forth,
but
that's
not
what
the
commission
said
it
means.
now,
at
page
643
of
the
record
at
volume
2,
this
is
what
the
commission
says.
"certain
portions
of
our
regulations
have
a
bearing
on
the
safety
and
financial
issues
in
this
case.
the
basic
statements
of
the
standards
under
which
the
commission
will
issue
both
licenses
and
construction
permits
is
section
50.40
of
our
regulations."
then
on
the
next
page,
"under
that
regulation,
where
a
construction
permit
for
a
developmental
facility
is
involved,
the
commission
must
be
assured
that
(a)
the
construction
of
the
facility
will
not
endanger
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public,
(b)
the
applicant
for
the
permit
is
technically
and
financially
qualified
to
engage
in
the
proposed
construction.
and
(c)
the
issuance
of
the
permit
for
construction
will
not
involve
inimical
to
the
common
defense
and
security
or
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public."
now,
when
it's
clear
now,
we
submit
that
this
language
can't
be
distorted
to
mean
anything,
but
that
the
commission
had
in
mind
that
all
that
they
were
obliged
to
do
at
this
time
in
dealing
with
the
construction
permit,
is
to
find
that
the
--
it
will
be
safe
during
the
construction
period.
well
now,
nobody
contested
that.
that
is
--
that's
an
act
of
supererogation.
nobody
challenge
--
or
we
--
we
don't
say
this
establishes
a
building
code
in
any
kind,
but
it
is
clear
that
the
commission
was
saying
that
it
is
--
it
is
free
in
fact
of
the
obligation
to
make
a
finding
at
this
time
that
the
--
the
reactor
couldn't
be
destructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
for
the
purposes
of
a
provisional
construction
permit.
now,
the
question
is
this
--
mr.
benjamin
c.
sigal
well,
the
--
the
commission
was
following
the
words
of
its
section
--
of
this
regulation
50.35
which
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment.
but,
it
inserted
this
--
this
qualification
which
deprives
of
its
essential
meaning.
now
to
show
that
the
commission
really
meant
seriously
this
qualification
and
so
greatly
limited
it,
we
suggest
you
compare
what
it
said
in
its
final
decision,
finding
22
and
what
it
said
in
its
initial
decision
on
the
very
same
point.
now,
its
finding
in
the
initial
decision
appears
at
page
615
of
the
record,
that's
volume
2.
now
at
that
time,
the
commission
said,
"the
commission
finds
reasonable
assurance
in
the
record
that
a
utilization
facility
of
the
general
type
proposed
in
the
prdc
application
amendments
thereto,
can
be
constructed
and
will
be
able
to
be
operated
at
the
location
proposed
right
under
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public."
that
qualification
was
not
present,
namely,
for
the
purposes
of
a
construction,
provisional
construction
permit.
but
when
they
came
to
the
final
decision,
they
inserted
that
qualification.
now,
that
can't
be
an
accident.
that
isn't
for
literary
purposes.
in
the
light
of
how
we
interpreted
its
other
regulations,
it
is
--
it's
particularly
its
basic
regulation
50.40,
this
means
that
it
was
making
a
finding
for
the
sake
of
--
for
the
purposes
primarily
of
the
construction
period.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
other
findings,
which
are
similarly
qualified
--
basic
finding
which
are
similarly
qualified
for
the
purposes
of
a
construction
permit.
and
it
cannot
be
said
we
submit
in
the
light
of
the
--
of
the
background
here
that
those
are
--
those
words
were
surpluses.
there
was
no
reason
for
them
at
all.
the
only
finding,
apparently
the
principal
findings
on
which
the
government
relies
is
number
18,
which
appears
on
page
706.
now,
that
finding
fails
to
say
that
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
construction
permit
that
the
commission
has
information
sufficient
to
provide
a
reasonable
assurance
of
safe
operation
at
the
proposed
location.
all
that
this
says
is
that
they
expect
to
have
such
information
at
some
time
in
the
future.
now,
we
say
that
this
is
not
in
accord
with
their
own
regulation,
which
says
that
at
the
time
that
there
was
a
construction
permit
issued,
it
--
there
must
be
that
finding.
now,
in
--
we've
discussed
all
of
these
various
regulations,
if
the
court
please
in
our
brief,
i
won't
--
there's
no
time
left
to
go
into
them.
but
i
want
to
point
out
simply
in
conclusion
that
the
court
below
examined
all
of
these
matters
and
simply
has
said,
"the
most
charitable
thing
it
could
say
was
it
just
didn't
know
what
the
court
below
meant
and
therefore,
it
could
not
pass
on
the
validity
of
this
permit
and
it
therefore
remanded
it."
now,
we
say
that's
the
most
charitable
thing
to
say
about
this
and
that
i
would
--
under
the
circumstances,
this
will
have
to
--
this
should
go
back
in
--
at
the
very
least
to
find
out
what
was
the
actual
basis
of
the
commission's
decision.
and
if
i
may
in
closing
this
quote,
the
language
--
the
solicitor's
language
of
judge
cardozo,
justice
--
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
which
the
case
was,
in
fact,
under
because
the
--
it
was
not
clear
and
the
court
said,
"the
difficulty
is
that
it
has
not
said
so
with
the
simplicity
and
clearness
through
which
a
haunting
impression
ripens
into
a
reasonable
servitude.
in
the
end,
we
are
left
to
spell
out,
to
argue,
to
choose
between
conflicting
inferences."
now,
that's
the
very
best
that
can
be
said
of
the
decision
in
this
case.
we
must
choose
between
conflicting
inferences
of
and
contradictions
right
within
the
language
of
the
commission
--
commission's
decision.
of
course,
we
think
that
it
goes
further
than
that.
we
think
the
commission
has
actually
failed
to
interpret
the
law
in
these
regulations
properly.
but
at
the
very
best,
it
is
so
confused
that
it
cannot
be
upheld
under
the
present
basis
and
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
