justice
william
o.
douglas
where
are
you
reading?
justice
william
o.
douglas
thank
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
has
--
has
any
license
been
refused
where
there
was
a
construction
permit
issued?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
thought
that
there
were
115.
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
oh.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
your
--
your
recommend
is
on
a
quite
a
different
plain
i
think,
less
than
anything
has
been
exposed
so
far
because
i
understand
it,
your
--
your
conclusion
is
--
your
supposition
is
that
the
same
findings
are
necessary
for
the
construction
permit
that
are
necessary
for
the
license.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
therefore
the
construction
permit
didn't
issue
on
their
--
on
the
proper
findings
therefore,
if
this
construction
was
finished,
under
this
permit,
a
license
couldn't
issue
because
the
necessary
findings
were
never
made.
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
you've
lost
your
case.
[laughter]
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
think
that's
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
your
standard
has
been
applied
here,
that
no
construction
permit
would've
issued
to
date.
justice
william
o.
douglas
until
the
research
had
been
finished
on
the
--
on
the
factor
of
safety.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
way
suggested
i
gathered
was
that
by
senator
humphrey
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
was
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
he
proposed
--
he
proposed
an
amendment
that
--
that
the
thing
that
to
be
required
is
a
thing
that
you
say
should
be
required.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
is
the
relevance
here
of
that,
mr.
claytor?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
had
not
understood
the
argument
in
those
terms.
i
--
i'd
--
because
i
assume
that
there's
no
influence
here
that
isn't
wholly
proper.
i
mean
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
whether
--
whether
it'd
be
chartable,
whether
it'd
be
a
private
enterprise
or
whatever
it
may
be.
the
pressure
--
argument
i
thought
was
that
no
bureau
would
welcome
the
reputation
of
having
built
and
created
and
allowed
to
be
built
and
created
a
great,
big,
fancy
multimillion
dollar
white
elephant.
