you

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sigal
before
you
get
farther
into
that
subject,
i
--
i
don't
quite
--
i
don't
believe
i
quite
got
your
point
yesterday,
just
at
the
conclusion
of
the
session
when
you
were
discussing
whether
or
not,
the
government
could
change
the
requirements
after
the
--
the
permit
to
construct
and
before
the
permit
to
operate
the
reactor.
what
just
--
just
what
is
your
position
on
that?
what
--
what
changes
can
they
make
if
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
as
i
--
as
i
understood
you,
i
may
have
been
wrong,
but
as
i
understood
you
that
after
the
government
had
once
issued
this
permit
to
construct
the
plant
that
it
is
powerless
to
change
the
--
the
--
requirements
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
is
there
any
limitation
on
what
they
can
do
to
make
it
more
safe?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
when
the
--
when
the
government
gave
permission
to
construct
this
reactor,
that
it
was
basing
its
action
upon
present
knowledge.
that
this
is
an
evolving
science
and
--
and
maybe
before
the
plant
is
constructed,
there
will
be
much
greater
knowledge
and
much
better
knowledge
on
--
on
how
to
protect
the
public
and
that
the
government
reserves
the
right
on
issues
that
--
that
the
construction
permit
to
require
the
contractor
or
--
or
the
--
the
builder
to
conform
as
of
the
time,
conform
to
the
best
knowledge
they
have
as
of
the
time
that
is
to
be
operated
and
--
and
they
take
the
chance
financially
of
a
change
in
--
in
knowledge,
so
that
if
--
if
become
more
expensive
or
this
is
found
to
be
unsafe,
why,
they're
the
losers,
but
the
government
seeks
to
protect
the
public
in
that
way.
now,
that's
--
that's
generally
the
way
i
understood
the
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
i
thought
you
didn't
agree
with
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
does
it
have
the
--
have
the
power
when
the
plant
is
constructed
to
say
now
on
--
on
the
basis
of
knowledge
we
now
have,
this
is
not
safe
therefore,
you
cannot
operate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
that
authority.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
to
say
they
took
this
permit
at
their
peril
and
--
and
if
it
later
developed,
that
it
wasn't
a
safe
way
to
do
it,
they
--
they
couldn't
operate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
though
they
have
the
permit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
right.
that's
all
i
want
to
know
what
the
difference
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
22.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
many
miles,
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
30
miles.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
how
does
the
--
how
does
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
broad
discretion,
weaken
the
argument
to
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
they
say
they
don't
--
there's
no
limit
--
they
can
do
anything
they
want?
chief
justice
earl
warren
will
you
take
it
something
in
their
briefs
or
something
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
his
broad
discretion,
that
doesn't
say
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
his
broad
discretion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
642?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
were
those
requirements
met
here,
do
they
do
those
things?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
--
and
they
supplied
that
information.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
they
do
that,
isn't
that
exactly
what
the
government
says
that
they're
obliged
to
do?
there's
--
take
a
look
at
it
after
it's
constructed
and
--
and
get
all
the
additional
information,
all
the
additional
knowledge
and
if
--
if
at
that
time,
it
isn't
satisfactory,
it's
got
to
be
made
satisfactory
or
it
cannot
--
cannot
operate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
moore
--
mr.
claytor,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
claytor,
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
you
--
at
any
stage
of
this
proceeding
after
it
once
granted
this
operational
license
on
a
low
level,
could
the
government
at
any
time
then
say,
well,
it's
--
it's
safe
up
to
this
point,
but
we're
not
sure
whether
it
will
be
safe
beyond
that
so
therefore,
you
can
only
operate
it
at
this
level.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
could
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
