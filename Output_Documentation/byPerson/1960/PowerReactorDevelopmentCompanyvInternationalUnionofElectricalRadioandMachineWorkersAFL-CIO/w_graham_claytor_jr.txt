mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
spite
of
the
many
steaming
complexities
which
surround
this
case,
i
think
the
issue
before
this
court
at
this
time
is
basically
a
very
simple
one.
before
i
turn
to
that
issue,
however,
i
think
i
should
say
a
few
words
about
the
nature
of
the
applicant
for
license
here,
my
client,
the
power
reactor
development
company,
which
has
been
called
prdc
by
its
initials.
prdc
is
a
nonprofit
membership
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
michigan.
its
members
consist
of
some
14
public
utilities
and
seven
industrial
corporations.
it
is
entirely
financed
by
contributions
which
it
received
from
its
member
companies.
its
sole
purpose
is
to
acquire
knowledge
and
experience
in
the
field
of
atomic
energy
and
it's
doing
it
by
constructing
a
developmental
reactor,
the
reactor,
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
there
is
no
investment
in
this
project
in
the
normal
sense
because
this
is
not
a
commercial
or
--
or
industrial
project
in
any
sense.
the
money,
which
is
being
spent
to
build
this
plant,
has
already
been
expanded
by
the
member
company
that
it
had
been
disbursed
and
treated
as
a
disbursement
to
this
company,
to
this
nonprofit
organization.
under
its
bylaws
and
under
its
charter,
there
can
be
no
distribution
of
any
proceeds
to
the
member
companies
and
on
liquidation,
none
of
these
moneys
can
be
returned
to
the
member
companies.
it
must
be
devoted
permanently
to
scientific
or
research
purposes.
now,
coming
to
the
issue,
it
seems
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
i
think
that
this
best
in
this
case
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases,
mr.
justice
douglas,
on
the
extent
to
which
there
is
any
realistic
possibility
that
pressure
could
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
commission,
to
permit
this
plant
to
operate
at
the
time
it
is
completed.
this
is
solely
a
research
undertaken.
we
have
acquired
a
great
deal
of
valuable
information,
which
has
been
made
available
to
the
public
entirely
through
the
commission
in
which
--
all
of
which
will
be
so
raised
later.
should
add
with
any
research
project,
should
it
turn
out
to
be
less
successful
than
we
had
hoped.
we
will
not
--
it
will
not
have
been
counted
as
a
failure
because
we
have
already
acquired
a
tremendous
amount
of
information
showing
in
fact
that
this
particular
avenue
of
approach
is
not
the
best
one
toward
nuclear
power,
would
itself
constitute
an
important
addition
to
knowledge.
there
is
no
possibility
that
should
this
plant
not
be
permitted
to
be
operated,
there
could
be
under
any
--
under
the
circumstances
of
the
background
here,
any
pressure
brought
to
bear
on
the
commission
to
issue
a
license.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
well,
my
point
i
think,
is
that
it
would
not
be
a
white
elephant.
its
whole
purpose,
we're
--
we're
--
its
whole
purpose
is
to
acquire
information
much
of
which
has
already
been
acquired
even
in
the
non-nuclear
testing.
we
have
solved
an
enormous
number
of
design,
engineering
and
metallurgical
problems
in
a
way
which
is
a
value
to
future
reactors
of
this
and
other
types.
the
kind
of
pressure
that
seemed
to
be
considered
by
senator
humphrey
and
others,
not
in
terms
of
safety
on
that
was
perhaps
the
pressure
which
would
result
from
having
put
a
commercial
investment.
people
have
invested
money
in
a
commercial
enterprise.
the
only
utility
of
building
a
paper
mill
is
to
make
paper.
and
if
you've
invested
money
in
the
paper
mills
and
then
you
can't
run
it,
obviously,
there's
--
the
responses
at
least,
they're
going
to
be
extremely
unhappy.
i
don't
believe
that
where
a
public
safety
is
involved,
there
is
any
realistic
chance
that
a
responsible
agency
would
pay
any
such
attention
to
the
pressure.
my
only
point
is
that
with
a
research
undertaking
by
its
nature,
the
pressure
doesn't
exist
in
other
cases,
where
the
issue
is
public
safety.
i
don't
think
the
pressure
would
be
effective.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
they're
located
over
good
deal
of
the
eastern
united
states,
the
detroit
edison
company,
the
philadelphia
electric
company,
a
number
of
utilities
like
that
the
westinghouse
company
combustion
engineering.
this
is
a
--
a
consortium
of
companies
who
are
interested
in
advancing
knowledge
in
the
field
of
the
application
of
atomic
energy
to
the
generation
of
electric
power
who
have
put
their
money
into
this
project
for
the
purpose
of
developing
this
information.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
one,
the
detroit
edison
company
is
--
is
the
--
the
company
which
is
actually
building
the
generating
facilities
to
which
the
plant
will
be
attached.
prdc
does
not
own
and
will
not
operate
any
generating
facilities.
we
only
build
the
reactor.
the
detroit
edison
company
is
building
perfectly
conventional
generating
facilities
to
which
our
plant
will
be
attached
and
to
whom
we
will
sell
steam.
now,
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
one
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not,
the
atomic
energy
commission
under
the
statute,
has
got
authority
to
issue
a
construction
permit
on
a
provisional
basis.
on
the
basis
of
lesser,
a
lesser
degree
of
assurance
that
the
reactor
can
operate,
then
it
admittedly,
must
find
in
order
to
permit
that
operations.
now,
a
subsidiary
question
is
what
did
these
findings
mean?
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
and
the
findings
together,
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
commission
did
not
find
merely
that
construction
of
this
reactor
was
safe.
they
devoted
a
great
deal
in
fact
substantially
all
of
the
analysis,
of
the
evidence
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
reactor
with
a
higher
degree
of
probability
could
be
shown
to
be
safe
at
the
time
that
that
showing
is
required,
this
before
the
operating
license
is
to
be
issued.
they
plainly
did
not
say
all
we
are
finding
is
that
constructional
safe.
they
did
say
that
that
is
all
that
one
particular
provision
of
their
regulation,
section
50.40
required.
and
i
think
a
fair
reading
indicates
that
that's
so.
that
regulation
sets
up
a
series
of
things
that
must
be
found
before
any
particular
activity
may
be
approved
or
authorized.
and
what
the
commission
said
was
in
applying
that
regulation,
we
test
it
by
what
is
actually
being
approved
or
authorized
in
the
particular
license.
section
50.35,
which
is
the
regulation
controlling
here,
which
provides
that
the
commission
must
find
reasonable
assurance
that
a
reactor
of
the
general
type
proposed
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location.
has
been
interpreted
by
the
commission
in
this
and
in
every
other
case
to
mean
a
finding
that
the
reactor
--
a
finding
of
reasonable
assurance
of
safety,
but
an
assurance
which
is
not
as
definitive
as
the
assurance
which
they
must
find
later.
since
this
regulation
had
at
its
end
you
will
recall,
specific
condition
that
said
that
the
issuance
of
an
operating
license
or
rather
it
says,
the
construction
permit
is
subject
--
expressly
subject
to
the
submission
of
the
missing
information
and
to
the
determination
that
the
final
design
is
safe.
this
is
plainly
what
it
means.
and
i
submit
that
the
only
question
which
is
before
the
court
is
one
of
statutory
interpretation,
does
this
regulatory
scheme
which
the
commission
has
applied
to
developmental
reactor
is
that
valid
under
the
statute.
now,
when
i
say
developmental
reactors,
i
think
we
must
realize
that
while
50.35
of
the
regulations
does
not
distinguish
between
commercial
reactors,
which
are
licensed
under
section
103
and
developmental
reactors
under
104
in
words,
it
plainly
intends
to
draw
that
distinction
because
this
procedure
is
only
available
in
cases
where
because
of
the
nature
of
the
project,
there
is
insufficient,
the
--
the
applicant
is
unable
to
submit
all
the
information
at
the
start.
the
very
first
words
of
section
50.35
of
the
--
of
the
commission's
regulations
as
they
are
set
out
in
the
government's
brief
provides
where
because
of
the
nature
of
a
proposed
project,
an
applicant
is
not
in
a
position
to
supply
initially
all
of
the
technical
information
otherwise
required.
then
this
procedure
which
calls
for
a
lesser
determination
of
safety
is
to
be
followed.
but
now
in
other
cases,
where
the
applicant
is
in
a
position
to
submit
all
of
the
information
at
the
start,
50.35
is
not
applicable.
there
has
not
yet
been
any
large
power
reactor
which
can
fall
in
that
category.
we
have
listed
in
--
an
appendix
to
the
various
briefs,
all
of
the
power
reactors
thus
far
licensed
for
prior
to
the
decision
of
below,
that
was
a
total
of
nine
including
this.
every
one
of
those
had
been
licensed
on
the
basis
of
these
findings.
i
would
like
as
an
example
to
refer
to
the
finding
of
--
that
the
commission
made
in
the
yankee
application,
which
is
set
out
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
53
in
the
appendix
to
the
government
reply
brief
at
page
53.
just
to
give
the
court
the
feeling
that
there
is
nothing
unique
in
this
case
as
respondents,
i'm
afraid
has
said
through
either.
here
is
what
the
commission
said
in
its
full
opinion,
an
opinion
by
the
full
commission
granting
this
yankee
permit
which
occurred
in
1957.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
page
53
of
the
government's
reply
brief.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
the
construction
permit
must
be
provisional
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding,
principally
because
yankee
has
not
completed
the
design
of
the
reactor
and
certain
features
of
the
proposed
facility
present
unresolved
questions
which
might
affect
its
safe
operation.
these
features
have
been
identified
and
discussed
in
certain
testimony.
we
agree
with
that
testimony
and
i
now
quote
again,
"the
experimental
program
outlined
in
the
application
will
probably
produce
the
information
needed
to
resolve
these
questions
prior
to
consideration
of
the
final
design
and
operating
procedures
and
conversion
with
the
construction
permits
were
licensed."
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
this
one
is
now
in
operation,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
in
massachusetts.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
rowe,
massachusetts,
some
40
mile
--
40,
45
miles
east
of
albany,
new
york.
now
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
for
all
power
reactors,
that's
the
large
reactor.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
now,
there
have
been
50
to
60
small
research
reactors
which
have
been
licensed
in
largely
for
use
in
colleges
and
universities.
there's
one
at
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
of
1000
kilowatts
power
which
is
located
right
in
the
center
of
cambridge,
massachusetts.
those
--
some
of
those
have
been
issued
on
the
basis
of
provisional
construction
permits
like
the
one
here.
that
has
always
been
the
case
where
the
particular
reactor
presented
novel
features
that
had
not
been
completely
proved
out
before
they
started.
however,
a
great
many
of
these
as
the
commission
pointed
out
in
its
decision,
really
represent
production
line
models.
there
are
50
or
60,
not
that
many,
25
or
30
of
these
public
type.
they're
produced
perfectly
standardized.
everyone
knows
about
it.
on
those
small
research
reactors,
the
commission
has
issued
non-provisional
construction
permits,
not
relying
on
the
procedure
in
section
50.35.
it
had
made
a
finding
of
reasonable
assurance
that
the
reactor
as
proposed
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location.
now,
even
with
those,
if
to
answer
your
question
that
came
up,
even
with
those,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
if
someone
should
discover
before
the
operating
license
is
issued,
there
--
a
terrible
mistake
has
been
made
and
there's
an
inherent
danger
in
one
of
these
reactors.
the
commission
could
still
refuse
to
give
the
operating
license.
but
of
course,
in
this
field,
that's
true
even
after
you
have
an
operating
license.
there's
no
possible
doubt
that
if
after
a
reactor
has
been
running
for
15
years,
it's
discovered
that
there's
an
unknown
inherent
safety
defect
in
it.
its
license
will
be
immediately
revoked.
the
commission
has
that
power.
this,
where
a
public
safety
is
--
is
concerned,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
and
the
commission
stated
in
its
opinion
that
this
is
the
overriding
consideration.
now,
it
is
not
feasible
with
large
developmental
reactors
even
to
make
the
definitive
determination
that
the
reactor
can
be
operated
at
its
full
power
when
the
reactor
has
been
completed.
the
commission
has
a
whole,
another
series
of
steps
in
its
procedure
of
which
the
provisional
construction
permit
is
only
the
first.
that's
the
only
one
involved
here,
but
the
others
were
imported
because
it's
an
integrated
system.
when
the
reactor
has
been
completed,
one
of
these
large
types
i'm
talking
about,
you
don't
just
turn
on
the
switch
like
you
might
with
a
conventional
power
plant
or
you
would
with
a
--
with
a
paper
list.
you
operated
at
a
very
low
power,
a
lower
power
than
for
example
this
mip
reactor
that's
in
the
middle
of
cambridge.
and
you
operated
that
way
for
quite
a
while
and
you
take
all
the
data
from
that
operation
and
you
analyze,
you
see
if
any
changes
in
these
and
then
you
operated
at
the
next
step
up.
you
may
do
this
with
the
relatively
conventional
reactor
in
one
or
two
or
three
steps.
you
may
do
it
in
quite
a
few.
the
--
the
point
is
that
the
commission
has
developed
that
procedure
in
section
50.57
of
its
regulations
which
in
our
reply
brief.
and
that
this
procedure
fits
hand
in
glow
with
its
provisional
construction
permit
procedure
to
provide
a
series
of
safety
reviews
starting
from
the
time
you
dig
dirt
until
the
final
time
when
you
operate
the
reactor
at
full
power.
this
is
the
only
really
reasonable
way
in
which
the
regulatory
system
providing
fully
for
public
safety
can
be
keyed
to
the
technological
facts
of
life
of
this
industry
at
this
stage
of
its
development.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
with
the
step-by-step
starter
procedure?
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
this
is
done
under
50.57
of
the
regulations.
but
first,
we
have
to
have
another
hearing,
a
report
of
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safeguards
and
the
determination
that
we
can
take
the
first
step.
that
step
will
give
us
a
limited
license.
the
commission
calls
it
a
provisional
operating
license,
to
let
us
go
up
to
500
watts.
after
we
have
done
that
for
a
month,
we
have
to
come
back
to
the
commission
and
apply
for
the
next
step
up
and
the
whole
procedure
is
repeated.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
a
separate
permit.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
it's
limited
both
in
time,
the
maximum
provided
is
18
months
and
it's
limited
in
power.
and
after
we
have
done
that,
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
commission
and
make
a
new
application
for
the
next
power,
the
next
step.
we
may
or
may
not
have
to
go
back
to
the
advisory
committee
on
reactor
safeguards
because
their
initial
approval
of
operation
which
has
not
happened
in
our
case
yet,
will
happen
when
we
get
to
that
point.
their
initial
approval
may
or
may
not
cover
one
step
or
several
steps.
but
the
commission
must
have
a
separate
proceeding
right
straight
across
the
board
each
time
and
this
gives
you,
i
think,
the
maximum
safety
protection
by
not
one
analysis
of
safety
on
the
basis
of
blueprints
which
no
one
at
this
stage
of
the
development
really
is
capable
of
doing.
it
--
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
i
think
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
gives
the
commission
a
broad
authority
within
the
framework
of
meeting
its
obligation
to
protect
the
public
health
and
safety,
to
do
what
is
required
by
the
technological
situation
in
which
this
industry
finds
itself.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
yes.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
absolutely,
sir.
mr.
w.
graham
claytor,
jr.
absolutely.
they
certainly
could
and
the
usual
problem,
if
i
may
just
be
practical
about
it,
the
usual
problem
is
not
black
and
white.
you
can't
go
any
higher.
the
usual
problem
is
we
--
you're
safe
to
this
point,
but
we
have
a
problem
about
the
next
point.
until
you
solve
that
problem,
you
can't
go
there.
and
if
we
can't
solve
the
problem,
that's
the
end
of
the
line.
that's
as
far
as
we
go.
but
what
would
normally
happen
would
be
and
it
maybe
a
delay,
it
maybe
six
months,
it
maybe
longer,
that
we
go
back,
we
solve
the
problem,
we
obtain
a
new
instrument,
if
they
say
you
require
before
you
can
go
to
the
higher
thing.
we
demonstrate
that
the
instrument
works
and
then
we
go
to
the
next
power.
