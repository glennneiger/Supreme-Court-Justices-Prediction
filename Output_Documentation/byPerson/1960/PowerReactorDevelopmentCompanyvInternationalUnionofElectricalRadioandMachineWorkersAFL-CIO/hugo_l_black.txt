justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
general
size
of
that
whole
thing
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
just
this
one
question?
i
don't
want
to
disturb
you.
have
you
stated
your
questions
correctly
in
your
questions
presented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
for
construction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question
but
i
don't
want
to
delay
you
at
all.
but
do
--
suppose
you
are
wrong
on
this
clause
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
that
this
is
a
license
permit,
are
there
findings
--
permit
to
operate,
are
there
findings
with
which
you
say
the
findings
would
support
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
is
a
crucial
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
do
that,
would
you
mind
stating
if
you
agree
with
the
government
that
the
issue
before
us
is
the
issue
stated
in
the
government's
brief,
as
the
questions
presented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
a
little
confused,
now.
i
don't
want
to
do
add
an
execution
to
it.
but
i'm
looking
now
at
the
section
on
page
135
of
the
government
brief,
50,
35.
it
is
your
view
that
the
government,
that
the
commission
did
or
did
not
find
that
make
the
findings
with
reference
to
and
evaluation
by
the
commission
that
the
final
design
provides
reasonable
assurance
that
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public
will
not
be
endangered.
do
you
think
they
did
or
did
not
make
that
finding
as
required
by
that
condition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
say
that
they
have
or
have
not
made
that
finding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
say
that's
necessary
whether
it
is
a
construction
permit
or
a
construction
and
an
operation
permit
or
just
an
operation
permit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
do
you
say
about
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
that
finding
has
been
made
there,
is
it
your
argument
that
that
is
enough
to
allow
them
to
operate
the
plant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
that
finding
been
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
then
do
you
say
--
i
hate
to
ask
you
too
many
questions
but
i
--
i'm
a
little
confused.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
then
do
you
say
that
--
if
this
--
do
you
say
this
first
finding
has
not
been
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you,
therefore,
say
they
do
not
have
any
right
to
get
a
construction
permit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
to
go
on
further
than
that
and
say
that
they
nevertheless
have
issued
a
permit
which
would
permit
operation
of
the
plant,
even
without
ever
proving
this
latter
part?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
realistic
more
in
what
you
say
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
say
this
finding
has
not
been
made,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
basis
of
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
wrong
in
that,
what
happens
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
they
had
made
a
finding
to
this
effect
that
--
under
this
first,
when
you
say
they
are
authorized
to
issue
the
permit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
say
it's
alright?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
--
is
that
right
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
have
not
made
it
in
substance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
sigal
i
think,
maybe
i
understand
your
petition
better
now,
but
i'm
not
sure
so
that
--
that's
the
reason
i'm
saying
it.
as
i
look
carefully
at
the
findings
34
and
35,
i
find
their
issue
--
they
relate
to
the
issuance
of
a
provisional
construction
only.
they
do
not
mention
operation.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
34
and
35,
upon
which
the
government
relied.
well,
the
purpose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
the
purposes
of
a
provisional
construction
permit
have
reasonable
assurance
at
the
case
in
(inaudible)
is
find
--
financially
qualified
to
engage
in
the
construction.
they
say
they're
--
an
operation
of
the
reactor
and
its
issuance
of
a
provisional
construction
permit
will
not
be
inimical
to
the
common
defense
or
to
the
health
and
safety
of
the
public.
and
the
prospective
says
the
commission
is
satisfied
if
it
has
information
just
this
first
one,
sufficient
to
provide
reasonable
assurance
that
a
facility
of
the
general
types
purpose
can
be
constructed
and
operated
at
the
proposed
location
without
undue
risk
to
the
health
and
safety
and
these
findings
seemed
to
be
limited
to
offer
the
sale
that
the
public
health
and
safety
will
not
be
jeopardized
merely
by
the
building
itself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
were
saying
that
it's
necessary
under
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
--
can
be
constructed
and
operated
that
they
should've
had
the
finding
say
both
as
to
construction
and
operation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
they
have
not
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
thought
that
was
it
and
i
--
i
come
back
for
the
idea
that
i
originally
have,
if
the
government
hasn't
correctly
stated
this
question
when
it
said
that
you're
objecting
to
the
finding
because
they
relayed
only
to
construction
and
they
have
not
found
that
the
safety
would
be
adequately
protected
under
the
law
as
to
the
operation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
that
was
the
question
were,
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
nothing
has
been
said
about
the
word
proposed
location.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
have
not
it's
stated,
what
is
the
proposed
location
with
reference
to
people
that
around
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
is
that
based
on
your
argument
that
their
finding
22,
34,
35
fall
short
of
the
standard
requirement,
because
they
have
applied
a
law
in
the
statutory
standards
to
construction
permits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
in
that
connection
if
it
wouldn't
disturb
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposed
they
had
left
out
in
their
finding
that
--
that
which
you
considered
to
be
a
limitation
of
their
finding
to
a
mere
construction
permits,
would
you
say
that
that
finding
then
met
the
standards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
operation
and
their
building?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
--
supposed
they
just
left
out
the
part
which
seems
to
limit
it
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
the
provisional
construction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
in
sort
that
the
statute
and
the
regulation
that
require
findings
to
be
made
before
they
permit
a
construction
of
a
building,
not
that
the
building
is
safe
or
that
the
operation
of
the
building
is
safe.
but
they
must
go
further
and
find
that
at
that
time,
building
itself
--
the
management
of
that
building
and
its
operation
for
a
production
purposes,
will
not
endanger
the
health
of
the
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
safe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
mean
safe
at
that
location?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
that
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
--
they
do
have
the
authority
to
make
--
to
require
that
it
shall
be
built
so
as
to
operate
safely.
there
can't
be
any
question
about
that
because
the
--
the
act
requires
that
there
be
a
--
a
finding
of
safety
of
operation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
this
one
to
be
located?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
massachusetts.
