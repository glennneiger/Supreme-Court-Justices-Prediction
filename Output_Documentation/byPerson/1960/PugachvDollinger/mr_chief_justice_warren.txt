mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
you
may
continue.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
you
may.
mr.
dillon.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
dillon,
before
we
get
into
that
statement,
may
i
ask
what
the
status
of
that
other
indictment
is?
you
told
us
that
they
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
--
continue
to
trial
on
this.
now
what
--
what
is
the
status
of
the
other
one?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
--
and
who
issued
those
injunctions,
the
state
court?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
oh
--
oh,
yes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
is
it
a
part
of
the
record
that
mr.
todaro
said
that
--
that
the
press
stated
that
there
had
been
a
tap
on
his
wire
for
four
months
and
related
what
happened
there?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
anolik.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
is
there
any
indication
how
often
it
is
used,
mr.
anolik.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
i'm
just
thinking
about
new
york.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
oh,
yes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
will
have
--
does
that
include
those
given
to
the
police?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
oh
no,
no,
no.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
is
it
limited
--
is
it
limited
to
any
particular
kinds
of
crime?
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
i
just
--
i'm
just
interested
in
that
answer
to
that
because
what
mr.
todaro
said,
he
said
that
--
that
instances
where
they
would
issue
a
warrant
of
that
kind
to
--
to
detect
a
prostitute.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
that
you
would
think
they've
said
at
new
york
that
if
they
were
using
it
purpose,
there'd
be
more
than
400
in
--
of
all
kinds
used
in
a
year.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
yes.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
well
i
--
i
don't
doubt
to
that.
i'm
--
i'm
just
asking
--
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
we
held
that
congress
did
act.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
we
understand
it
when
congress
said,
no
one
shall
do
it,
congress
meant,
no
one
should
do
it.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
but
you
say,
we
didn't
consider
it,
we
did.
mr.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
mr.
todaro.
