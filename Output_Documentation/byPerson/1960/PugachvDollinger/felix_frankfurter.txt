justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
assuming
aren't
you?
you're
assuming
that
congress
has
said
that
a
federal
statute
on
a
matter
of
evidence,
should
apply
in
the
state
court
that's
what
you're
assuming.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
isn't
so
then
you
are
now
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
a
state
has
power
and
has
not
been
interfered
with
by
congress
by
preempting
a
statute
to
consider
what
are
its
notions
of
the
law
of
evidence,
then
whether
injunction
or
post
(inaudible)
invalidation
of
an
--
of
a
conviction
is
the
same
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
called
the
--
federal
court
doesn't
fit
to
just
exercise
its
own
notions
of
propriety
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
my
mind
doesn't
altogether,
it
disappeared
if
it
has
power,
but
i
had
first
have
to
determine
whether
there's
power
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
evidence,
as
to
what
is
admissible
in
a
state
court,
assuming
the
admissibility
doesn't
involve
some
infringement
of
the
constitution,
but
merely
a
statutory
pronouncement
by
congress,
you
have
first
to
decide
whether
congress
passed
this
statute
that
govern
the
standard,
the
admissibly
of
evidence
in
the
state
court.
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
then
it
doesn't
matter
for
me
at
least,
or
for
anybody
with
injunction
or
subsequent
validation
or
invalidation
of
a
conviction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
is
that
--
in
new
york,
must
every
district
attorney
give
advance
notice
that
he
has
tapped
wires?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
his
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
defendant
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
they
have
to
know
it
before
the
case
comes
to
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
this
time
we
--
we
could
just
(inaudible)
our
federal
court
and
just
get
a
blanket
injuction
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
any
case,
the
district
(inaudible)
should
--
should
offer
in
evidence,
is
that
what
your
position
requires
that
the
court
go
that
far?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
you
know
of
this
case
that
whether
you
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
don't
be
frank
if
isn't
--
if
it
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
relevant
to
the
case
or
in
this
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
putting
here
a
basic
part
of
your
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
--
unusual
situation
that
you
had
knowledge,
the
defense
had
knowledge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
most
cases,
equitable
relief
wouldn't
be
available
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
someone
is
caught
as
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
change
the
laws
so
as
to
legalize
wiretapping
in
state
which
make
a
deal
of
by
their
laws?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
had
--
in
your
long
career,
have
you
had
great
success
in
getting
(inaudible)
courts
not
to
overrule,
what
to
reappraise?
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
--
what
is
this,
the
latest
case
that
you
referred?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
how,
you
couldn't
do
it
because
it's
a
federal
offense
and
not
a
state
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
it
would
--
the
existence
of
violation
of
new
york's
state
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
enforceable
in
the
new
york
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
maybe
or
maybe
a
violation
of
federal
law,
prosecutable
in
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
parr.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all
events,
you
couldn't
prosecute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
all
those
instance,
all
is
a
--
all
the
instances
that
you've
given
are
instances
in
which
if
the
case
goes
to
trial
in
the
state
court
and
one
of
those
questionable
contested
(inaudible)
of
evidence
is
admitted
and
as
--
and
that
conviction
results,
the
conviction
can
then
be
assailed
in
this
court
with
petition
for
certiorari
is
granted,
on
the
ground
that
it
has
a
vice
in
defiance
in
denial
of
a
federal
right,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
all.
a
state
prosecution
must
respect
not
only
the
federal
constitution,
but
also
governing
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
question
is
agreeing
with
you
that
this
court
has
not
rest
at
605
on
the
fourth
amendment,
that
merely
it
is
act
of
congress
dealing
with
evidence
or
admissibility
of
evidence
in
defining
criminal
conduct
enforced
in
the
federal
court,
prosecuted
in
the
federal
court
or
could
make
--
utilize
the
state
court
that
having
done
so,
you
have
to
go
further
and
say
that
that
statute
constitutionally
might
have
led
congress
to
say
we
are
now
promulgating
a
rule
of
evidence
of
a
conduct
that
prosecution
in
federal
courts
and
in
state
courts.
and
if
there
is
such
a
constitutionally
permissible
federal
enactment
regarding
evidence
applicable
also
to
the
state
prosecution,
if
there's
a
defiance
of
that
federal
rule
and
a
conviction
results
that's
a
denial
of
a
federal
right
(inaudible)
then
it's
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
abbate
and
we're
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
the
question
--
you
don't
deny
on
saying
â€“
in
admitting
to
that,
you
don't
deny
what
my
question
--
you
don't
answer
my
question.
you
merely
say
that
the
statute
may
not
be
applicable
in
the
federal
court,
but
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
and
constitutionally
may
govern
a
trial
in
the
state
court,
a
disregard
of
a
federal
statute
relating
to
evidence
applicable
in
state
courts,
would
be
a
denial
of
a
federal
right
that
could
be
drawn
here,
could
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
like
discussing
on
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
a
conviction,
you
could
attack
the
validity
of
the
conviction
on
the
ground
that
it
has
an
illegal
ingredient.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
why
do
you
have
to
go
to
new
york
--
deal
with
the
problem
in
that
indirect
way?
isn't
that
what
schwartz
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
why
do
bother
about
a
state
court
in
which
there
was
certiorari
denied
and
therefore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
therefore,
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
no
opinion
was
written.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
how
that
didn't
--
that
just
let
the
law
of
court
stand,
but
schwartz
is
precisely
the
case
you
and
i
have
been
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely,
a
claim
of
a
federal
right
disregarding
a
state
prosecution
resulting
in
the
conviction,
challenged
here
as
an
illegal
conviction
and
the
court
said,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
you
proceed
mr.
anolik
you
lead
me
in
a
state
of
confusion,
maybe
at
my
own
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
--
see,
if
i
follow
your
argument.
you
say
that
the
new
york
scheme,
new
york
legislation
that
the
detailed
of
your
statute,
circumscribing
the
power
of
district
attorneys
to
get
these
orders
on
the
basis
on
which
alone
they
can
get
them
and
with
the
authority
of
a
supreme
court
justice
that
that
statute
is
not
in
contradiction
to
605,
but
in
--
is
complemented
thereto
and
therefore
not
outlawed
by
it.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
--
you
went
beyond
that.
you
said
you
prosecuting
officials
are
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
as
to
what
your
duties
and
your
rights
are,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
i
followed
you.
i
don't
understand
what
the
quandary
is
ever
since
benanti
because
that
came
up
from
evidence
secured
through
wiretapping
in
a
perfectly
new
york
statute,
legal
way.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
you
had
in
that
case,
the
very
situation
you've
been
talking
about
and
if
you're
right,
then
that
evidence
was
not
illegally
offered
and
introduced
in
benanti.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
if
the
new
york
statute
is
merely
complementary
to
605,
it
also
legalize
--
it
legalizes
the
evidence
and
it
legalizes
from
your
point
of
view
as
well
in
the
federal
courts
and
in
the
state
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
benanti
said
the
opposite.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
why
are
you
then
in
a
doubtful
state
of
mind
as
to
what
your
--
the
limits
of
your
power
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
the
amicus
brief,
which
asked
us
to
reconsider
at
the
more
familiar
term
to
be
than
reappraise
to
reconsider
and
overrule
benanti.
i
understand
that
but
i
do
not
understand
you
that
you're
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
as
to
what
the
state
of
the
law
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
dealing
with
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
dealing
with
the
schwartz
problem,
which
is
a
very
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that
too,
but
that
doesn't
change
the
decision
of
benanti.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
up
to
that
time,
they
couldn't
read
what
benanti
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
that's
not
a
matter
for
this
court
whether
the
prosecuting
authority
and
the
federal
government
prosecute,
that's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
our
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
--
what
basis
there
is
for
the
claim
that
conscientious
new
york
prosecutors
didn't
know
what
the
governing
federal
law
was
insofar
as
the
--
the
collision,
the
practical
collision
between
605
and
the
new
york
legislation
pertains
to
prosecution
in
the
federal
court.
i'm
trying
to
restrict
the
assumption
that
i'm
making.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
two
questions;
one,
does
605
make
this
a
federal
offense
applicable
to
--
to
and
make
--
doesn't
make
any
exception
as
the
state
officials
operating
on
an
otherwise
valid
state
law
and
the
answer
is,
no,
that's
benanti.
schwartz
is
a
different
question,
for
me
a
totally
different
question.
has
congress
said,
that
the
consequence
of
admissibility
in
a
state
trial
of
such
violation
of
605,
bars
that
evidence
from
being
used
and
that's
totally
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
fully
understand
the
question.
i
fully
understand
the
problem
that
confronts
you,
but
it's
not
the
problem
before
this
court,
namely
what
is
--
what
are
the
conscientious
prosecutors
do
either
in
not
prosecuting
or
prosecuting
or
not
respecting
what
you
find
on
the
books
as
the
law
of
the
land.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
not
--
that
is
not
the
question
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
problem
for
adjudication
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
i
understand.
i
understand
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time,
i
was
party
to
that
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
any
doubt
about
it,
but
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
that
this
court
after
years
reinterprets
its
interpretation
of
what
congress
impliedly
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
all
you're
saying
is,
you
wanted
to
reconsider
whether
that
in
the
construction
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
be
placed
upon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
--
this
is
not
a
--
the
quandary
you're
under
is
not
a
very
particular
crime,
a
particular
quandary
about
a
more
general
situation
that
confronts
district
attorneys
when
there
is
a
conflict
in
public
opinion
between
the
law
and
the
feeling
of
the
community.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
will
live
through
it,
particularly
new
york,
well
knows
what
that
quandary
meant
to
very
conscientious
district
attorneys,
but
that
isn't
the
problem
here
at
all
and
that's
your
problem
is
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
schwartz
still
stands,
then
you've
got
a
very
narrowly
confined
problem
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
moral
issues,
you
would
rely
on
the
benanti
for
what
is
relied
--
to
be
relied
upon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
were
in
his
shoes,
you'd
start
with
benanti.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
matter
of
fact,
while
my
friend,
the
district
attorney
from
brooklyn,
(inaudible)
the
whole
brief
based
on
his
request
that
we
overrule
benanti,
that
isn't
your
claim,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
well,
why
don't
you
stick
with
that
--
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
principle
of
advocacy
to
answer
your
opponent?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
one
had
suggested
that.
i
think
the
chief
justice
will
bear
me
out,
no
one
has
suggested
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
the
precedent
of
some
of
the
ablest
lawyers
i've
ever
listened
to.
you
want
to
win
on
the
broadest
possible
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
consummate.
