pugach
is
a

justice
john
m.

did
--
did
he
modify
his
views
on
--
judge
waterman,
i
mean
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
en
banc
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
state
their
trial
in
the
(inaudible)
of
whichever
it
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
when
you
replied
to
me?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
cases
are
going
to
trial,
are
they?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
case
has
gone
to
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
court
bearing,
do
you
think
the
schwartz
case
has
(voice
overlap).
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
do
it
in
your
time,
i
just
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
you
have
to
get
rid
of
it,
in
some
way.
justice
john
m.
harlan
part
form
its
general
effect
it
has
a
roadblock
effect
on
your
position
in
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
only
for
--
only
for
authorized
police
officers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
technically,
the
court
of
appeals'
injunction
or
stay
did
not
enjoin
the
trial
as
he
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
enjoined
the
use
of
the
evidence.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
are
entirely
free
if
you
wish
to
proceed
in
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
suppose
the
district
attorney
could
be
indicted
under
the
benanti
decision
that
may
violate
the
statute
even
though
the
evidence
was
admissible.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
that
the
statute
covers
both
divulging
and
tapping
by
being
in
the
conjunctive?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i
wasn't
suggesting
any
answer,
i
was
asking
a
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
four.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
isn't
granted,
it's
your
point,
yes.
[laughter]
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
--
your
point
is
that
as
a
practical
assistant
district
attorney,
when
you're
told
by
united
states
supreme
court
that
you
are
violating
the
federal
law
that
you
among
other
danger
bound
to
(inaudible)
by
getting
that
supreme
court
order
permitting
you
to
tap,
you
have
some
hesitation
as
to
whether
you
as
an
honorable
man
ought
to
do
that
even
though
the
supreme
court
also
tells
you
that
if
you
do
do
it
and
you're
successful
in
your
prosecution,
your
conviction
is
alright,
that's
your
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
a
problem
for
adjudication
that
your
problem,
that's
what
you're
trying
to
tell
us?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
--
you
could
win
this
lawsuit,
this
present
case
and
still
as
an
assistant
district
attorney
be
under
the
cloud
that's
worrying
and
what
you're
saying
is
an
effect
to
remove
you
from
that
cloud,
we
ought
to
do
something
about
benanti
rather
than
you're
trying
to
handle
it
through
the
congress.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you'd
like
the
other
part,
you
would
like
us
to
overrule
schwartz
and
you
don't
want
us
to
do
that
so
that
wouldn't
the
case
but
you'd
like
to
win
the
case
by
having
us
--
by
having
to
overrule
benanti.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
there's
a
practical
matter,
this
is
quite
far
a
field
but
you're
so,
in
respect
to
benanti
is
quite
far
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned?
it's
a
practical
matter
or
it
can't
be
this,
turn
the
case,
where
they
got
a
case,
where
they
think
they
ought
to
use
wiretaps,
are
they
refraining
from
getting
wiretaps
(inaudible)
benanti?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
isn't
quite
the
question
i
asked
you
might
not
want
to
try
the
case
until
the
issue,
which
you
(inaudible)
in
this
case
is
resolved
but
are
district
attorneys,
county
district
attorneys
were
refraining
from
tapping
wires
under
proper
court
orders.
