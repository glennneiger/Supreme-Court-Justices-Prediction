mr.
irving
anolik
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
generally,
have
had
occasion
to
interpret
section
605
on
several
occasions.
i
cannot
find
a
single
case
where
any
federal
court
or
this
court,
predicated
an
interpretation
of
section
605
upon
constitutional
grounds.
it
is
therefore
patent
that
we're
dealing
here
with
the
federal
statute.
we
are
not
dealing
with
any
constitutional
prohibition.
the
position
of
the
respondents
in
this
case
is
that
the
new
york
statute
and
constitution
does
not
contravene
section
605.
the
issue
in
this
case
however,
transcends
the
question
of
wiretap
in
itself.
it
goes
somewhat
further.
the
issue
is
further
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
shall
enjoin
the
state
of
new
york
as
to
the
introduction
of
--
of
evidence
in
the
state
court.
in
other
words,
shall
a
federal
judge
sit
side
by
side
in
the
state
courts
now
and
rule
upon
evidence
and
should
this
precedent
be
established
when
stefanelli
v.
minard
clearly
indicate
it
should
not
be,
then
why
limit
it
to
section
605
situations?
it
could
certainly
be
invoked
in
any
situation.
the
improper
empanelling
of
a
jury,
the
systematic
exclusion
of
a
particular
race
in
a
jury,
the
trial
atmosphere,
coerced
confessions,
the
justices
of
this
court
of
course,
are
familiar
with
it
--
with
the
opinion,
it's
definitely
against
minard
and
i
just
raised
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
correct.
and
i
recognize
as
i
stated
at
the
very
commencement
of
my
argument
that
section
605
does
not
carry
the
same
prohibition
and
is
not
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
now
--
mr.
irving
anolik
what
do
you
mean
on
the
basis
of
supreme
--
supremacy?
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
think
in
abbate
or
abbate
against
united
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
a.b.b.a.t.e.,
abbate
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
against
united
states
in
359
u.s.,
this
court
indicated
that
where
a
state
law
compliments
a
federal
statute
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
it
certainly
would
not
be
brought
by
means
of
an
injunction
though,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
presumably
yes,
presumably
it
could.
mr.
irving
anolik
presumably,
it
could
be
brought
to
this
court
that
is
correct.
now,
the
position
that
the
respondents
take
however,
is
that
this
court
has
previously
considered
section
605
with
respect
to
whether
or
not,
the
admission
or
the
introduction
of
such
evidence
is
illegal
and
for
that
matter,
whether
or
not,
605
contravenes
or
nullifies
the
statute
--
the
statutory
and
constitutional
plan
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
people
against
stemmer,
affirmed
in
this
court,
stemmer
against
new
york.
mr.
irving
anolik
yes,
(inaudible)
is
going
to
get
to
schwartz.
mr.
irving
anolik
it
was
granted,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
anolik
in
stemmer,
certiorari
was
granted.
mr.
irving
anolik
no
opinion
was
written,
but
it
was
affirmed.
mr.
irving
anolik
divided
--
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
i
just
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
right
and
this
court
would
necessarily
have
to
overrule
schwartz
against
texas
in
order
for
the
petitioner
here
to
prevail.
the
respondents
respectfully
submit
that
schwartz
against
texas
has
been
reaffirmed
by
the
federal
courts
on
several
occasions
that
there
is
no
warrant
in
overturning
that.
that
it
would
be
an
invasion
of
the
police
power
of
the
state
of
new
york,
if
you
will,
to
have
the
federal
court
determine
what
statutes
or
what
constitutional
scheme
a
particular
state
might
have
to
enforce
its
own
police
power.
now,
we
must
distinguish
between
the
irresponsible
and
reckless
invasion
of
privacy
by
private
wiretapping.
the
district
attorney
and
the
police
commissioner
certainly
do
not
condone
or
--
or
feel
that
private
wiretapping
in
any
way
should
be
permitted.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
new
york
state
law
is
far
more
stringent
than
the
federal
act.
the
federal
act
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
tap
wires.
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
is
far
broader.
it
prohibits
not
only
the
tapped
conversation
on
the
telephone,
but
prohibits
eavesdropping
generally
and
makes
it
a
felony
to
violate
that.
it
is
--
the
requirements
of
the
state
of
new
york,
are
that
a
supreme
court
justice
after
a
hearing,
issue
a
warrant
before
any
wiretap
order
can
be
granted
and
that
is
the
position
in
which
we
would
have
this
court
view
the
statutory
scheme
in
new
york.
we
are
not
talking
about
an
illegal
wiretap
in
the
sense
of
some
irresponsible
individual
just
riding
roughshod
over
the
rights
of
an
individual
as
the
petitioner
led
this
court
to
believe.
this
was
as
he
acknowledges,
a
--
a
legal
wiretap
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
new
york.
appended
to
with
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae,
the
district
attorneys
association,
there
are
a
number
of
remarks
by
district
attorney
silver
and
other
people,
clearly
indicating
that
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
has
not
resulted
in
flagrant
abuses
or
--
or
numerous
wiretap
orders
that
there
has
been
great
restraint.
and
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
would
be
impossible
or
at
least
very
difficult
to
prosecute
certain
types
of
crime,
without
this
benefit
for
law
enforcement.
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
concomitant
detriment
to
the
individual.
that
is
true
undoubtedly,
in
--
in
search
and
seizure,
lawful
search
and
seizures.
no
doubt
that
a
criminal
would
much
prefer
that
search
and
seizure
not
be
permitted,
but
by
court
warrant,
it
is
permitted
by
a
--
a
lawful
warrant.
similarly
in
the
wiretap
situation,
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
permits
a
wiretap
under
strict
safeguards
and
makes
it
a
felony
for
any
individual
without
a
lawful
warrant,
to
tap
wires.
mr.
irving
anolik
there
again,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
very
elaborate
appendix
where
dash
in
his
recent
book
entitled
the
eavesdroppers,
indicates
that
there's
promiscuous
use
of
wiretapping.
now,
statistics
--
mr.
irving
anolik
in
new
york.
yes,
i
am
talking
about
new
york,
now.
mr.
irving
anolik
statistics
compiled
and
set
forth
in
the
amicus
appendix
and
in
--
in
the
respondents'
brief
as
well,
indicates
that
for
example,
in
1952,
i
believe
that's
the
year
it
was
alleged
that
there
were
58,000
wiretap
orders
in
new
york
city
alone.
a
survey
conducted,
indicated
that
the
police
commissioner
and
all
five
county
district
attorneys
had
only
secured
480
wiretap
orders.
now,
there
is
certainly
a
discrepancy
there.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
includes
those
given
to
the
police.
now,
it
does
not
include
illegal
wiretaps.
mr.
irving
anolik
and
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct.
now,
frankly,
let
me
say
this.
the
district
attorney
of
any
county
in
new
york,
including
myself
and
respondent
here,
do
not
wish
to
place
themselves
in
a
position
of
violating
federal
law.
we
certainly
don't
want
to
do
that.
we,
however,
are
now
in
a
quandary.
we
actually
do
not
know
whether
or
not,
we
can
legally
wiretap.
there
was
an
opinion
certainly
in
terrorem
in
its
nature,
written
by
justice
--
judge
waterman
in
the
court
below,
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
prosecution
was
urged
and
threatened
for
the
lawful
obedience
to
the
statute
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york.
in
other
words,
we
have
put
in
the
quandary
now
of
not
knowing
whether
or
not,
we
have
this
--
what
we
consider
important
instrument
to
fight
certain
type
of
crime.
let
me
pose
one
hypothetical
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
chief
justice
warren,
it
is
not
limited.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
had
no
doubt
for
that
--
has
not
done
in
cases.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
chief
justice
warren,
i
will
say
that
i
believe
the
statistics
compiled
and
the
appended
in
the
amicus
brief
are
accurate.
mr.
irving
anolik
and
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
would
think
that
they
certainly
are
not
interested
in
wiretap
orders
generally
unless
there
are
some
organized
rings
of
prostitution.
i've
been
trying
to
think
that
would
be
an
isolated
instance
where
they
would
go
to
the
trouble,
but
getting
a
wiretapped
order
which
has
to
be
manned
by
eight
detectives
or
police
officers,
each
wiretap
has
to
be
manned
by
that
many
people
or
a
simple
prostitute,
unless
there
was
some
organized
ring,
i
wouldn't
think
that
that
would
come
to
the
picture
at
all.
now
let
me
pose
--
mr.
irving
anolik
yes.
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
i'm
sorry.
yes,
i
hope
to
--
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
a
position,
we
--
we
are
urging.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
said
since
the
opinion
of
--
of
judge
waterman
in
the
court
below.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
--
i
recognize
that
benanti
indicated
that
was
a
violation
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
irving
anolik
the
position
that
we
are
taking
with
respect
to
benanti,
justice
frankfurter,
is
that
it
was
while
there's
no
doubt
that
what
the
opinion
said
it
did
not
rest
upon
an
interpretation
of
section
605
which
would
warrant
that
statement.
mr.
irving
anolik
let
me
--
we
are
uncertain
to
this
extent.
our
court
of
appeals
as
to
benanti,
has
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
we
recognize,
but
by
the
same
token,
there
had
--
seems
to
have
been
a
--
a
rather
consistent
policy
--
if
i
may
coin
the
phrase
"of
salutary
neglect"
on
the
part
of
the
federal
government
in
enforcing
section
605.
mr.
irving
anolik
that's
correct,
but
it
was
not
until
judge
waterman
wrote
his
concurring
opinion,
where
he
more
or
less,
directed
the
u.s.
attorney
to
--
mr.
irving
anolik
frankly,
i
say
that
they
certainly
could've
read,
but
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
policy
of
--
of
letting
it
lie
would
continue.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
what
we
are
trying
to
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
understand
that.
i
understand
--
mr.
irving
anolik
justice
frankfurter,
perhaps
by
posing
a
hypothetical,
i
can
make
my
position
more
--
more
clear.
let
us
assume
that
a
--
that
a
very
important
public
official
is
assassinated
in
the
state
of
new
york
by
means
of
a
high-powered
rifle,
no
witnesses,
the
only
possible
way
they
find
out
who
committed
that
crime
is
through
a
wiretap.
now,
the
district
attorney
has
an
obligation
to
prevent
a
killer
from
walking
the
streets.
by
the
same
token
he
knows
that
if
he
uses
that
wiretap,
he
maybe
indicted
and
prosecuted
for
a
misdemeanor.
he
is
now
put
in
this
quandary.
is
it
his
duty
to
permit
a
murderer
to
walk
the
streets
or
is
it
his
duty
to
take
the
risk
of
being
prosecuted
for
misdemeanor
and
redress
that
grievous
and
heinous
crime?
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
let
me
then
--
mr.
irving
anolik
i
recognize
that.
let
me
then
rephrase
my
statement,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct,
but
let
me
then
say
this,
justice
frankfurter
that
we
certainly
do
urge
this
court
to
reconsider
its
position
in
that.
mr.
irving
anolik
now,
with
respect
to
the
injunction
which
is
being
sought
here,
i
think
that
at
the
very
commencement
of
my
argument,
i
--
and
justice
frankfurt
would
seem
to
have
supported
that
position
if
i
interpret
him
correctly,
that
the
injunction
here
in
effect,
would
mean
that
on
the
premise
that
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
might
use
wiretapped
evidence,
the
petitioner
here
would
say
that
the
federal
court
should
enjoin
this
possibility
upon
application.
now,
the
petitioner
here
does
not
know,
but
that
the
district
attorney
has
the
consent
of
one
of
the
parties
to
that
conversation.
i
don't
say
that
we
did,
but
assuming
that
we
did,
it
would
certainly
be
perfectly
permissible
even
under
the
federal
law
to
introduce
that,
the
rafton
case
and
other
cases,
yet
on
the
assumption
that
wiretap
evidence
might
be
used,
he
goes
into
a
federal
court
and
the
federal
court
says
that
you
are
enjoined
from
using
it.
and
then
by
some
pickwickian
reasoning,
they
say,
but
you
can
go
right
ahead
with
your
trial.
now,
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
feel
that
they
must
reserve
the
right
to
use
whatever
evidence
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
will
deem
legally
admissible
and
how
can
we
prognosticate
for
the
future?
what
the
exigencies
of
a
particular
trial
will
demand?
what
evidence
might
become
available
perhaps
for
the
purposes
of
impeachment
of
a
particular
witness?
and
yet
by
enjoining
it
in
blank,
we
could
not
even
use
wiretap
legally
obtained
with
the
consent
of
the
sender
perhaps.
and
that
is
another
dilemma
that
is
faced
here
by
the
injunction
question
and
the
--
the
respondents
most
respectfully
are
this
court
that
since
that
is
the
specific
issue
before
this
court,
the
injunction
issue
because
after
all
that
is
the
particular
matter
that
was
before
the
district
court
that
certainly
it
should
not
go
as
far
as
the
petitioner
says.
and
the
respondents
would
urge
this
court
to
reconsider
benanti
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
605,
which
when
it
was
passed,
not
a
word
was
said
about
what
was
intended
to
be.
and
the
appendix
of
the
amicus
indicates
that
senator
mclaughlin
and
congressman
cellar,
before
this
court
announced
its
decision
in
benanti,
both
were
under
the
firm
conviction
that
the
federal
law
did
not
prevent
the
use
of
wiretapping
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
let
me
say
this
that
this
court
apparently
felt
that
benanti
should
be
--
should
be
decided
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
congress
had
not
acted
and
perhaps
this
court's
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
that
--
that
is
also
a
--
an
interpretation.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
recognize
that
chief
justice
warren.
our
position
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well
--
i'm
just
saying
that
you
were
there
interpreting
what
the
congress
intended.
we,
--
the
respondents
here
maintained
that
an
equally
valid
interpretation
might
be
and
i'm
--
i'm
not
trying
to
be
disrespectful
to
this
court
believe
me,
but
i
say
that
an
equally
valid
interpretation
might
very
well
be
that
congress
never
intended
it,
that
congress
did
not
want
to
thwart
the
police
power
of
a
state.
mr.
irving
anolik
i
know,
they're
just
--.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct,
justice
frankfurter
and
that's
the
position
to
respondents
are
urging
--
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
mr.
irving
anolik
quite
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
that
is
correct.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
we
--
mr.
irving
anolik
there
is
no
question
about
that,
but
i
am
mindful
of
the
argument
that
has
been
promulgated
by
my
colleague
here.
that
he
seems
to
rely
upon
benanti
very
strongly,
although
the
issue
here
as
you
well
know,
is
not
benanti.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i'm
relying
on
benanti
to
no
extent.
i
am
hoping
--
mr.
irving
anolik
oh,
i
have
no
doubt
of
that
particularly
since
the
argument
i
have
--
mr.
irving
anolik
well
let
me
say
this,
first
of
all,
we'd
want
to
win
the
case
if
possible,
by
this
court
holding
that
it
will
not
agree
that
an
injunction
is
warranted,
that's
the
specific
issue
--
mr.
irving
anolik
right.
secondly,
if
this
court
is
going
to
consider
my
colleague's
position
at
all,
with
respect
to
benanti,
then
it
should
reconsider
the
entire
case
and
we
are
hopeful
that
in
reconsideration,
perhaps,
it
might
come
to
a
different
conclusion.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
my
claim
is
a
rather
narrow
claim.
mr.
irving
anolik
well,
i
am
sticking
to
it,
but
since
it
was
raised
first
by
my
colleague,
mr.
todaro
here,
i
feel
and
--
and
this
court
apparently
showed
some
degree
of
interest
said
from
its
questions.
i
feel
that
i
--
it
is
not
a
miss
for
me
to
stray
off
the
--
mr.
irving
anolik
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
--
i
certainly
don't
claim
to
be
an
excellent
advocate
by
any
means.
i'm
just
trying
to
do
a
job
the
best
way
i
know
justice
frankfurter
and
as
i
say,
if
this
court
feels
i'm
presumptuous
in
doing
this,
i
certainly
am
--
mr.
irving
anolik
but
--
but
certainly
our
position
is
the
narrow
issue
that
the
injunction
should
not
be
granted
and
if
the
court
however,
decides
to
--
to
review
or
to
reconsider
benanti
at
all,
we
respectfully
submit
that
they
should
reconsider
it
and
perhaps
come
to
a
different
--
mr.
irving
anolik
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
irving
anolik
let
me
say
this,
that
the
policy
i
know
of
my
office
and
i
believe
i
interpret
the
sentiments
of
mr.
silver,
is
that
we
will
not
try
another
wiretap
case
until
this
issue
is
resolved.
and
that
--
mr.
irving
anolik
--
that
we
feel
frustrated
in
even
obtaining
a
wiretap
order
now,
in
view
of
--
of
benanti
and
--
mr.
irving
anolik
to
my
knowledge,
wiretapping
is
continuing,
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
irving
anolik
--
is
(inaudible)
wire
tapping
is
continuing,
however,
divulgences
are
not
--
mr.
irving
anolik
any
means,
thank
you
very
much.
