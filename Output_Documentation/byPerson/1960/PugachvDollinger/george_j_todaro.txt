mr.
george
j.
todaro
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
this
court.
in
this
case,
an
indictment
was
returned
against
the
petitioner
burton
n.
pugach
in
the
state
of
new
york,
bronx
county,
charging
him
with
a
crime
of
maiming,
assault,
burglary
and
conspiracy.
another
indictment
was
returned
against
him
charging
him
with
possession
of
a
firearm.
pugach
was
an
attorney
and
a
member
of
the
new
york
bar.
his
office
telephone
had
been
tapped
by
the
police
of
the
state
of
new
york,
pursuant
to
an
order
obtained
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
a
period
of
approximately
four
and
a
half
months
in
the
course
of
which,
this
court
must
realize
that
any
number
of
confidential
communication
were
intercepted
by
the
police
and
made
use
for
whatever
purpose
they
saw
fit
for
a
sedition
where
he
had
other
associates
in
his
office
whose
wires
were
also
tapped.
so
that
this
is
the
type
of
the
case
that
reminds
us
that
the
right
of
privacy
slowly
or
surely
being
eroded
insofar
as
the
protection
of
605
is
concerned.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
your
honor
i
might
off
the
record
--
say
he's
a
little
--
not
sound
mentally
but
that
is
no
--
nothing
to
with
the
issue
in
this
case.
now,
he
brought
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
wherein
he
sought
and
injunction
to
restraint
the
district
attorney
of
bronx
county
and
the
police
commissioner
of
the
state
of
new
york
from
using
and
divulging
wire-tapped
evidence
at
his
trial
in
the
county
court
on
both
indictments.
the
district
attorney
moved
to
dismiss
this
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
and
that
motion
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
an
appeal
was
taken
and
a
motion
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
preliminary
--
for
an
injunction
pendente
lite
to
keep
the
status
quo
until
the
full
bench
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
it.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
granted
a
temporary
state
and
if
i
maybe
permitted,
to
quote
from
judge
medina
who
over
judge
waterman
grant
at
this
stay
stated
as
follows.
pugach's
argument
is
that
section
605
of
the
federal
communications
act
makes
it
a
federal
crime
to
tap
a
telephone
and
divulge
or
publish
the
existence,
contents,
substance,
purport,
effect
of
such
intercepted
communication
that
the
defendants
or
their
agents
are
about
to
commit
this
federal
crime
by
further
divulging
and
offering
the
wiretap
in
evidence
at
the
trial.
the
supreme
court
has
in
effect
held
the
united
states
versus
benanti,
1957
that
the
constitutional
and
legislative
authorization
of
wiretap
on
the
state
of
new
york
is
illegal
and
void,
that
if
the
evidence
as
we
see
at
the
trial
and
pugach
is
convicted,
he
will
be
wholly
without
remedy,
since
under
the
schwartz
versus
texas,
1952,
344
u.s.
199,
which
is
still
in
effect,
the
evidence
will
be
admissible
under
the
new
york
rules
of
evidence,
even
though
illegally
obtained
and
his
conviction
will
not
be
revised.
he
also
claimed
that
the
result
to
such
violation
of
federal
law
would
deprive
him
of
his
legal
license
and
his
license
to
practice
law.
pugach
argued
that
unless
we
grant
the
injunctive
relief,
he
prays
that
defendant
on
arrangement
will
go
ahead
and
violate
the
federal
statute
with
impunity,
shielding
themselves
beyond
the
--
behind
the
constitutional
legislative
scheme
of
the
state
of
new
york
that
has
been
held
by
the
supreme
court
to
be
invalid.
this
is
a
probable
argument.
now,
we
have
been
unable
to
find
the
satisfactory
answer
and
i
like
to
quote
from
judge
waterman
who
also
joined
in
--
in
granting
this
temporary
stay,
who
stated,
“although
it
is
(inaudible)
that
the
federal
court
should
so
presume
to
interfere
with
the
only
progress
of
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
state
courts
by
issuing
state
order,
the
present
situation
is
improbable,
too."
it
goes
against
the
grain
(inaudible)
and
await
the
violation
of
a
federal
statute
one
knows
is
to
be
violated,
while
also
known
that
the
only
if
reversed
the
united
states
may
have
after
the
violation,
is
to
proceed
on
501
against
the
conscientious
police
office,
was
only
obeying
orders.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
a
modified
up
for
a
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
your
honor.
he
modified
it
for
a
different
reason.
he
modified
it
because
as
he
said
that,
he
could
not
concede
that
his
brethren
in
the
state
bar
would
condone
and
permit
the
commission
of
a
crime
in
the
very
parts
of
law
where
crimes
have
been
trapped
and
for
--
that
was
one
of
his
basic
reasons
for
agreeing
to
concur
with
the
rest
of
the
bench.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
your
honor.
oh,
no.
no,
he
concurred
in
that
opinion
if
your
honor
please
because
he
felt
that
the
--
that
the
judges
of
the
state
of
new
york
would
not
tolerate
the
violation
of
section
605
in
the
court
where
the
crime
was
being
charged,
but
in
this,
i'm
sorry
to
say,
he
has
been
disappointed
because
i'd
be
out
of
this,
still
signing
orders
in
new
york
as
though
tapping
wires
in
new
york.
it's
a
daily
affair
you
read
it
in
the
newspaper.
everybody
reads
it
in
the
newspaper
that
they
caught
this
prostitute
by
a
means
of
telephone
tap
or
this
party
by
means
of
telephone
tap
--
the
state
of
new
york
feels
that
it
is
not
bound
by
the
laws
of
united
states.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes
that
is
the
judge
in
nassau
county
refused
to
permit
the
wiretap
evidence.
he
is
about
--
that
is
about
the
only
one
that
the
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
beg
your
point.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes
your
honor
and
judge
welinz,
i
think
it
was,
refused
to
permit
wiretap
evidence
in
that
case.
he
felt
that
he
is
a
judge
what
is
bound
to
obey
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
and
he
would
not
permit
it,
but
that
isn't
the
situation
here
because
bronx
county
is
still
claims
that
they
have
no
right
to
do
so
and
they
are
still
doing
it.
they
are
still
tapping
wire
everyday
and
many
judges
are
still
signing
wiretap
warrants.
of
course,
it
might
be
of
interest
to
note
that
recently
even
after
the
veriano
case
by
our
court
of
appeals
and
the
brody
case
by
a
court
of
appeals,
one
of
the
judges,
judge
davidson
into
the
court
at
general
session,
refused
to
sign
the
wiretap
order.
and
i
think,
i
--
if
your
honor
would
bear
with
me,
i'd
be
quoted,
judge
davidson
in
refusing
to
sign
the
wiretap
order
that
was
requested
of
him
by
the
district
attorney
hogan
of
new
york
county
stated,
“lawlessness
by
the
police
and
the
district
attorney
who
has
sworn
to
uphold
and
enforce
the
law
will
not
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law,
nor
will
it
heighten
the
respect
of
our
citizen
for
our
law.”
he
and
another
judge
huster,
have
taken
similar
position,
but
they
are
in
the
very,
very
small
minority
because
wiretap
orders
have
been
signed
almost
daily
and
district
attorney
feels
that
it's
a
necessary
adjunct
for
law
enforcement.
well,
i
say
your
honors
that
if
it
is
a
necessary
adjunct
to
law
enforcement,
they
should
proceed
to
go
to
congress
of
the
unites
states
to
seek
the
relief
that
they
want.
now
congress
of
the
united
states
represents
all
of
the
people
and
when
605
states
no
person
shall
intercept
the
communication,
it
means
exactly
that
and
then
there's
no
exception
to
the
state
of
new
york
or
to
a
police
officer
of
the
state
of
new
york
or
to
a
judge
at
the
state
of
new
york.
it
applies
to
all
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
no
one
is
exempt
or
excluded.
well
now,
may
i
go
into
this
most
amenable
question
and
the
question
before
this
court
whether
this
court
will
indicate
the
supremacy
of
an
act
that
congress
which
is
declared
to
be
the
supreme
or
paramount
law
of
the
land.
it
revolved
as
so
shall
605
be
(inaudible)
entered
because
it's
being
violated
everyday,
there's
only
been
one
prosecution
throughout
the
existence
of
605
and
that
was
in
the
greece
case.
although
it's
common
knowledge
that
it
is
being
violated
everyday,
it's
the
question
whether
605
shall
be
decently
entered
for
all
time
to
beat
or
it
shall
be
given
new
vitality,
new
vigor
and
be
resuscitated
as
a
plot
--
as
it
properly
should
as
a
law
of
the
united
state
that
should
be
respected
and
obeyed
until
the
congress
of
the
united
states
modifies
or
changes
that
law.
and
in
connection
with
this
in
the
first
nardone
case
and
this
question
came
up
before
this
court,
this
court
held
302
u.s.
at
page
382,
"we
nevertheless
--
nevertheless
face
the
fact
that
the
plain
weight
of
section
605
forbids
anyone
unless
authorized
by
the
sender
to
intercept
the
telephone
message
and
directs
in
equally
clear
language
that
not
person
shall
divulge
the
message
to
any
person
to
recite
the
contents
of
the
message
and
testimony
before
the
court
is
to
divulge
the
message.
the
act
forbids
such
testimony."
now,
i
recall
in
the
benanti
case,
i
was
the
attorney
who
had
the
benanti
case
and
i
had
to
prove
(inaudible)
the
benanti
before
this
court.
this
court
even
went
so
far
to
say
that
a
divulsion
to
a
judge
is
a
violation
of
the
law
or
divulgence
to
anyone
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
of
course,
i
might
say
that
in
benanti
i
am
digressing
a
bit,
this
court
did
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
tapping
was
a
violation
of
law
or
tapping
and
divulging
because
in
the
benanti
case,
both
were
present.
now,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor
that
to
give
real
vitality
and
meaning
to
605,
what
congress
of
the
united
states
intended
was
that
no
person
shall
intercept
the
communication
and
as
soon
as
some
strong
language
is
used,
we
will
have
obedience
to
605
until
modified
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
thus
so
fits,
it
so
feels
fit.
now,
here
the
situation
is
that
we
are
trying
prevent
the
further
violation
of
605
by
divulgence
in
court.
although
there
was
a
tap
in
this
case
for
four
and
a
half
months,
although
some
of
that
testimony
was
adduced
before
the
grand
juries,
i
--
we
understand
to
the
present
part,
i
say
that
what
congress
really
intended
was
that
the
tap
to
be
stopped
because
a
tap
that
doesn't
sit
by
either
by
presumed
amusement,
hours
after
hours,
listening
to
conversation,
he
doesn't
do
it
for
his
personal
amusement,
he
does
it
for
a
definite
purpose
either
to
divulge
to
a
superior,
either
to
make
use
of
that
--
of
--
of
the
overheard
conversation
for
his
own
personal
reason
and
the
statute
says
that
the
person
shall
not
make
use
of
the
information
gathered
and
that's
what
prompted
the
second
nardone
case
where
the
court
abused
the
time
to
fruit
of
the
poison
street.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
and
i
want
coming
to
the
--
i
expect
that
your
honor
--
that's
the
impediment,
that's
the
fly
in
eye,
i
will
be
very
candid.
now,
i'll
try
to
use
(inaudible)
mr.
george
j.
todaro
in
the
first
place,
i
humbly
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
should
reexamine
the
schwartz
case.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
it
has
been
followed.
i
have
an
urging
that
this
court
now
reappraise
it.
however,
in
the
schwartz
case
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well,
reappraising,
i'm
choosing
the
way
that
it
can
overrule
is
that
this
--
i'm
on
this
side
of
the
fence,
if
i
had
my
way
at
overrule
and
i'll
be
very
frank.
[laughter]
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
think
it
would
be
a
(inaudible)
figure
if
that
was
modified
and
changed,
because
schwartz
has
given
encouragement,
has
given
some
sort
of
legal
background
for
these
continuous
violation
of
605,
because
under
the
blessing
of
schwartz
and
with
the
rules
under
the
guise
of
a
rule
of
evidence
under
the
pretext
that
under
the
rule
evidence,
anything
goes
as
statute
that
has
been
absolutely
nullified
for
all
intents
and
purpose
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
--
because
of
repeated
violations.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
it
for
sure
does.
i'm
well
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh,
no
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
let
me
proceed
this
way.
in
the
first
place,
the
schwartz
case
was
an
accomplished
violation.
it
was
an
isolated
case
in
texas
where
a
telephone
was
tapped
and
that
evidence
used
before
the
court
in
the
state
of
texas.
that
was
already
done
and
accomplished
when
the
case
came
before
this
court
and
this
court
held
at
that
congress
may
not
have
intended
the
write
a
rule
of
evidence.
i'm
not
saying
that
congress
intended
to
write
--
write
a
rule
of
evidence,
if
your
honor
please.
in
this
case
the
--
that
the
divulgence
has
not
taken
place
so
that
injunction
is
the
proper
proceeding
to
stop.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
your
honor,
may
i
say
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
agree.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
agree
with
your
honor.
but
would
the
--
would
it
be
more
--would
--
i
know
your
honor's
mind
is
that
we
don't
--
the
federal
courts
don't
want
to
interfere
with
the
proceeding
of
the
state
court
and
that's
a
proper
attitude.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
would
it
be
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
your
honor,
may
i
--
continue
my
argument
i
think
i
will
approach
it
on
different
way.
and
in
reference
to
the
nardone
case,
the
court
also
stated
at
page
383,
"the
answer
to
the
question
is
one
of
policy.
congress
may
have
thought
it
less
important
that
some
offenders
should
go
in
with
the
justice,
than
that
the
officer
shall
resort
to
admit
inconsistent
with
the
ethical
standards
and
destruction
of
personal
liberty.
now,
it
seems
to
me
of
a
statute
that
is
of
such
importance
to
all
of
people
of
the
united
states
should
be
protected
in
some
manner
or
other.
whether
we
would
be
--
necessary
to
reevaluate
schwartz
or
whether
by
through
injunctive
proceeding,
otherwise,
an
act
of
congress
of
new
york
can
destroy,
an
act
the
congress,
under
the
pretext
of
a
rule
of
evidence
then
the
state
of
idaho,
south
carolina,
originally
the
state
in
the
union
can
do
like
it.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
your
honor,
it
would
be
highly
incredible
or
practically
it's
possible
to
--
to
try
to
get
an
honest
public
official
who's
following
orders
from
the
head
of
his
department,
whether
it
be
a
policeman
or
an
assistant
district
attorney.
i
would
hate
to
see
some
of
my
colleagues
in
new
york,
district
attorney,
they're
all
friends
of
them
and
i
would
hate
to
see
them
prosecuted.
i'd
probably
would
never
return
an
indictment,
if
i
were
sitting
in
the
grand
jury,
but
under
the
guise
of
the
rule
of
evidence,
we
have
this
--
we
have
destroyed
the
statute
and
something
should
be
done
and
i
say
that
injunction
is
the
proper
remedy.
when
everything
fails,
we
always
return
into
the
old
equitable
powers
of
injunction
and
that
would
solve
the
problem
therein
mentioned.
they
say
this
your
honor,
and
if
once,
that
this
court
speaks,
frank
and
determined
and
ranks
the
--
and
reverses
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
grants
our
position,
there
will
never
be
anymore
violation
as
far
as
the
state
of
new
york,
because
most
public
officials,
most
judges
are
respectful
of
the
law
and
would
abide
by
the
law.
and
most
district
attorneys
and
i'm
sure
that
mr.
dollinger
(inaudible),
these
gentlemen
will
be
happy
with
a
disposition
that
we
have
a
clearcut
rule,
either
605
will
--
is
entirely
buried
and
forgotten
or
605
is
the
law
of
the
united
states
to
be
respected,
if
this
court
makes
their
ruling
a
proper
ruling
on
either
way,
there'll
be
no
violation
by
anyone
in
the
state
of
new
york,
whether
police
officer,
district
attorneys
or
judges.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
sir.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
nobody
knows.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
we
never
know,
sometimes
we
hear
about
it.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh,
no
--
no.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
my
position
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well,
i'll
be
very
frank
with
your
honor.
how
are
we
doing
this
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
if
it
is.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
it's
part
of
the
record
that
it
was
divulged
from
a
newspaper
and
that
caught
two
guys
because
of
these
telephone
taps
which
divulged
in
the
newspaper.
that
was
--
it
came
to
the
knowledge
of
defense
counsel.
i
wasn't
the
attorney
for
pugach
or
(inaudible)
mr.
george
j.
todaro
generally,
you
might
have
a
inkling,
but
you
really
its
not
usual
that
you
get
that
now.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
unless,
unless
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well,
unless
we
had
some
knowledge
that
there
was
a
tap,
we
would
--
they
could
make
use
of
it.
they
would
be
violating
the
law
by
making
use
of
it,
but
if
unless
they're
caught,
they'd
still
be
on
(inaudible)
a
thief
is
only
a
thief
after
he's
caught
more
or
less.
if
a
district
–
if
police
officer
makes
--
makes
the
tap
and
gets
some
information
that
makes
you
say
that
he
is
violating
the
law.
he
may
get
away
with
it,
but
if
he's
caught
and
he
is
brought
to
justice,
then
he
becomes
a
convicted
violator
of
605.
another
thing
i'd
like
to
pint
out
is
that
under
the
benanti
case
and
i
would
like
to
get
that
cleared
up,
we
--
we
the
--
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction
of
benanti
even
though
we
developed
the
wiretap
during
the
trap.
and
judge
medina
who
wrote
that
opinion
affirming
the
lower
court,
stated
as
follows,
"despite
the
warrant
issues
by
the
new
york
state
court,
pursuant
to
the
new
york
law,
we
have
no
alternative
other
than
to
hold
that
by
tapping
the
wires,
intercept
of
the
communication
made
by
the
appellant
and
divulging
at
the
trial
what
they
have
--
had
overheard,
the
new
york
police
officer
violated
the
federal
statute
and
cites
nardone
and
so
on.
section
605
of
47
u.s.c.a.
is
too
explicit
to
warrant
any
other
evidence
and
weiss
--
and
the
weiss
case
made
its
term
applicable
to
interesting
communication.
the
section
provides
no
person
not
being
authorized
by
the
said
assembly
shall
intercept
any
communication
that
divulged
or
published
the
existent
content
substantive
(inaudible)
the
meaning
of
such
intercepted
communication
to
any
person.
this
ruling
or
this
ruling
of
the
circuit
court
was
not
disturbed
by
the
supreme
court
--
by
this
court
when
benanti
came
up
on
appeal.
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
read
portion
of
that
benanti
appeal
that
came
before
this
court.
and
i
might
say
that
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states,
when
we
argued
that
case,
devoted
most
of
this
time
in
attempting
to
sustain
the
right
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
legislate
permitting
wiretaps,
because
under
the
law
as
to
the
state
of
new
york,
wiretapping
is
permitted,
pursuant
to
a
constitutional
provision
of
the
sate
and
pursue
--
pursuant
to
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
now
that
issue
came
before
this
court.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
yes,
your
honor
and
this
is
what
this
court
said,
"respondent
does
not
urge
that
constitutionally
speaking
congress
is
without
power
to
forbid
such
wiretapping
even
on
the
face
of
a
conflicting
state
law
weiss
versus
us
where
the
argument
that
congress
has
not
exercised
this
power
and
that
section
605,
being
general
in
its
term,
should
not
be
deemed
to
operate
to
prevent
the
state
from
authorizing
wiretapping
in
the
exercise
of
its
legitimate
police
function.
however,
we
read
the
federal
communications
act
and
section
605
in
particular
to
the
contrary,
both
for
the
state.
the
federal
communication
act
is
the
comprehensive
scheme
for
the
regulation
of
interstate
communication.
in
order
to
safeguard
those
interest
protected
under
section
605,
that
portion
of
the
statute
pertinent
to
this
case,
applies
both
to
intrastate
than
interstate
communication,"
weiss
versus
united
states,
supra.
the
natural
result
of
respondent's
argument
is
that
both
interstate
and
intrastate
communication
would
be
removed
from
the
statute
for
protection
because
as
this
court
noted
in
weiss,
the
interceptor
cannot
be
same
between
the
two
and
will
listen
to
both.
congress
did
not
intend
to
place
the
protection
so
plainly
guaranteed
in
section
605
in
such
a
vulnerable
position.
respondent
points
to
a
portion
of
the
act
which
places
some
limited
authority.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
luncheon
recess
i
was
reading
this
court's
opinion
in
benanti
versus
u.s.
and
i
got
to
approximately
disposition
in
that
case.
moreover,
we're
referring
to
section
605
here,
the
very
existence
of
these
grants
of
authority
to
the
state,
underscores
the
conclusion
that
had
congress
intended
to
allow
the
state
to
make
exception
to
section
605,
it
would
have
said
so.
in
the
light
of
the
above
consideration
and
keeping
in
mind
this
comprehensive
scheme
of
intra
--
interstate
regulation
and
the
public
policy
underlying
section
605
as
part
of
that
scheme,
we
find
that
congress
setting
out
a
prohibition
in
plain
terms,
did
not
mean
to
allow
a
state
legislation
which
would
contradict
that
section
and
that
policy
and
it
cited
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
and
hill
versus
florida
and
hines
versus
davidowitz.
the
authorities
cited
are
impressive.
it
is
therefore
clear
that
in
benanti,
this
court
has
held
this
constitutional
legislate
--
legislative
provisions
by
the
state
of
new
york
to
be
an
invasion
of
a
field
preempted
by
congress.
and
i
might
at
this
juncture
quote
from
judge
mcdonalds
in
his
--
in
his
opinion
in
granting
the
temporary
stay,
when
he
referring
to
the
benanti
case
he
said,
"moreover,
the
fact
the
wiretapping
is
authorized
pursuant
to
the
constitutional
legislation
of
the
state
of
new
york,
pursuant
to
which
new
york
judges
continue
to
order
wiretapping
and
police
officers
do
the
wiretapping
and
that
was
the
condense
of
wiretaps
in
their
testimony,
even
after
the
supreme
court
has
held
these
constitutional
legislative
provisions
to
be
an
invasion
of
a
field
preempted
by
the
congress,
makes
the
position
of
the
defendant
even
more
on
tenant."
if
that
be
so
and
if
the
statute
permitting
wiretapping
by
state
police,
pursuant
to
a
court
order
is
--
has
been
nullified
by
benanti,
if
they
cannot
orbit
in
the
same
field,
then
by
what
authority
has
the
state
of
new
york
presumed
to
invade
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
individuals
in
there
--
residing
in
their
state.
by
what
authority
can
--
they
haven't
even
got
the
summary
of
their
own
local
laws
or
state,
because
this
court
had
ruled
that
they
cannot
legislate
in
the
field
that
congress
has
already
enacted,
the
best
(inaudible)
605
particularly.
and
of
course,
if
i
may
say
that
the
hill
versus
florida
was
along
labor
relation
act
and
in
that
case,
this
court
stated,
our
holding
is
that
the
national
labor
relation
act
in
section
4
and
6
to
affirm
the
act
as
here
applied,
cannot
move
freely
within
the
orbits
of
their
respective
purposes
without
--
without
impinging
upon
one
another.
this
is
one
of
the
authorities
cited
by
this
court
in
benanti,
then
also
nelson
versus
--
hill
versus
florida,
no,
pennsylvania
versus
nelson
that
was
a
sedition
statute
based
upon
pennsylvania's
legislature,
which
was
stricken
down
by
this
court.
so,
it
is
apparent
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
congress
has
preempted
the
field
and
the
state
of
new
york
has
no
power
to
legislate
in
a
field
that
has
already
been
preempted
by
congress.
so
that
they
are
acting
without
even
the
semblance
of
legality
and
then
proceed.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
because
they
will
do
it,
what
are
the
recourses
of
that?
mr.
george
j.
todaro
your
right,
your
honor
except
this
that
because
of
schwartz
versus
texas
and
because
they
say
that
even
thought
they
are
violating
the
federal
law
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
even
though
they
are
violating
the
federal
law.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
for
violating
section
605.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
and
the
state
of
texas.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
what
did
schwartz
versus
texas
held
that
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well
–-
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
say
that
he
--
first,
in
the
first
place
your
honor,
the
state
takes
the
position
on
this
--
under
the
state
law
as
even
though
the
evidence
is
illegally
obtained
and
this
admissible
enough.
now,
this
--
this
matter
has
come
up
to
this
court
in
prior
occasion
through
the
ordinary
channels,
the
graziano
case
was
one
of
them
and
some
others,
where
certiorari
was
denied.
now,
the
fact
the
certiorari
is
denied,
there's
no
indication
that
the
court
approves
or
disapproves
of
the
proposition
raised.
this
simply
means
that
the
court
is
not
interested
in
listening
to
it.
now,
here,
we
realize
that
we
cannot
get
redressed
by
the
ordinary
procedure,
the
ordinary
channel
of
it,
one
up
to
our
court
of
appeals.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
must
beg
to
differ
with
your
honor.
i
think
the
schwartz
held
that
it
--
that
when
the
officer
testified,
he
was
violating
the
federal
law.
but
that
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes.
in
--
in
that
case,
the
--
the
court
held
that
they
did
not
believe
that
congress
intended
to
write
a
rule
of
evidence
for
the
state
of
texas.
and
they
permitted
that
evidence
to
stand
although
they
ruled
that
in
doing
so,
the
officer
was
violating
the
federal
law
of
section
605.
so,
we
are
confronted
with
schwartz
versus
texas
which
pins
us
down
as
the
only
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
that's
right.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
but
taking
--
taking
that
in
different
context
that
the
act
does
not
say
that
the
--
that
the
statute
can
be
violated
and
then
a
state
court
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
it's
says,
no
person
shall
intercept
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh,
he
could
be
prosecuted,
yes.
there's
no
question,
but
as
i
pointed
out
your
honor
and
since
of
the
existence
of
605
which
was
enacted
in
1934,
there's
been
one
prosecution,
one
prosecution
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
think
it's
about
1952
of
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
oh,
yes
there's
been
numerous
efforts
and
benanti
so
cites
it.
benanti
cites
that
very
situation
where
numerous
efforts
have
been
made
to
have
congress
change
the
law
for
espionage
or
for
narcotics,
various
other
positions,
congress
has
refused
budge.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
your
honor
is
correct.
i
would
--
but
there's
been
repeated
efforts
made
to
have
congress
modify
605
in
some
manner
or
other.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
(inaudible)
mr.
george
j.
todaro
no,
your
honor.
no,
this
is
by
a
process
of
judicial
decision
as
i
would
say,
but
it
would
seem
clear
to
me,
sir
that
if
605
or
an
act
of
congress
was
to
have
any
vitality,
any
meaning
that
perhaps
the
only
way
we
can
that
meaning
is
to
follow
what
was
said
in
the
elkins
case
only
recently,
where
i
think
it
is
judge
podastote
who
wrote
that
opinion
where,
the
court
stated
in
elkins
versus
u.s.,
"the
rule
is
calculated
to
prevent
not
to
repair.
its
purpose
is
to
deter,
to
compel
respect
to
the
constitutional
guarantee
in
the
only
effective
available
way
by
removing
the
incentive
to
disregard
it."
of
course
that
involved
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
made
by
state
police
turning
over
to
the
federal
government
for
the
prosecution
and
this
court
overturned
this
silver
--
platter
back
that
had
been
an
existence
for
about
forty
some
odd
years.
so
that,
it
would
seem
that
the
only
way
that
605
can
be
resuscitated
because
the
old
purposes
it
has
been
dead
statute
as
far
as
the
state
of
new
york
was
concerned,
it
only
way
can
be
done
is
by
the
process
of
exclusion.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
the
only
other
way
is
injunction,
your
honor.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
well,
the
law
in
vague,
your
honor.
now,
shall
this
--
this
court
vindicate
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
law
that
is
the
question?
if
it
decides
not
to
vindicate
the
federal
law,
then
605
will
be
decently
entered
and
we'll
forget
about
it.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
am
asking
this
court
to
reappraise
it.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
very
slim
--
your
honor
very
slim,
very
slim
success.
your
honor
i
would
like
at
this
juncture
to
read
a
portion
of
the
opinion
of
judge
clark
of
the
circuit
court
below,
who
was
--
who
dissented
from
the
--
the
opinion
of
the
majority
in
the
circuit
court.
i
think
it
sums
up
my
case
beautifully
and
i
would
rest
my
entire
case
on
his
dissenting
opinion.
he
does
a
masterful
job
by
the
way
and
he
states,
referring
to
the
benanti
case,
goes
into
the
fact
of
--
on
the
benanti
--
that
congress
setting
out
a
prohibition
plain
times
did
not
mean
to
allow
a
state
legislation
which
would
contradict
of
that
section
that
and
that
policy.
and
it
points
out
the
failure
of
congress
to
grant
exception,
though
strongly
importuned
to
do
so
and
this
is
cited
in
benanti
in
the
various
attempts
made
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
various
other
officials
that
have
congress
change
the
law
and
their
failure
in
doing
so.
then
he
goes
on,
notwithstanding
his
decisive
character
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
the
court
statement,
indeed
it
would
have
been
surprising
that
the
court
said
less,
for
the
absolute
character
of
the
prohibition
has
been
steadily
emphasized
over
the
years
and
the
attempt
to
make
the
statute
to
say
less
than
it
does,
as
been
conspicuously
unsuccessful.
so,
we
must
accept
the
interpretation,
the
wiretap
whether
by
state
or
by
anyone
else,
is
simply
and
shortly
forbidden
by
the
federal
law
subject
to
the
severe
penalty
of
fine
and
imprisonment.
attack
must
therefore
be
limited
to
the
meaning
on
law
--
of
new
legislation
because
of
its
hampering
effects
on
law
enforcement
and
prosecuting
officials
cannot
have
the
benefit
to
at
least
control
wiretap.
involve
the
surely
way,
you're
arguing
with
public
policy,
which
a
legislative
body
should
weigh,
but
these
arguments
have
not
yet
prevail
with
the
only
governmental
agency
having
authoritative
act
to
modify
the
existing
law
and
i
do
not
see
how
they
can
affect
the
responsibility
of
the
united
state
judges
to
enforce
that
law.
hence,
for
us
i
see
no
escape,
but
to
start
with
the
premise
that
we
are
faced
with
repeated
open
and
acknowledged
violation
of
federal
law,
which
we
are
assured
would
be
continued
until
and
unless
the
fellow
authorities
intervene.
thus
we
have
an
absolute
impasse
going
to
so
far
as
to
be
almost
ludicrous
if
the
issues
were
not
so
fundamentally
serious
and
it
further
states,
in
sum
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
the
there
is
a
general
indeed
universal
custom
of
federal
law
violation.
now
this
is
distress
in
situation,
may
not
less
so
that
in
the
eyes
the
many
were
they
seated,
it
this
required
by
the
assertive
existence
of
successful
law
administration.
but
it
is
not
an
unusual
situation
for
--
actually
it
is
a
clash
between
federal
and
state
governmental
policy,
as
such
its
recurring
struggling
our
history
and
quite
possibly
a
necessary
one
to
a
federal
form
of
government.
in
the
past,
we
always
found
ways
and
the
meaning
in
solving
the
problem,
of
course
there
are
several
forms
of
remedy,
but
the
one
to
which
seems
to
which
there
seems
continued
return
when
other
remedy
fails
is
the
resort
to
the
equity
powers
of
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
repeated
violation
of
criminal
law.
this
and
all
the
well-established
run
of
equity
jurisdiction
naturally
to
be
resorted
to
only
reluctant
as
against
state
official,
but
nevertheless
thoroughly
recognized
and
then
because
it
cites
a
number
of
cases
and
then
prefers
to
the
–
draws
analogy
between
the
segregation
cases.
now
a
further
statement,
all
these
question
of
jurisdiction
the
majority
he
would
concede
including
the
--
irreparable
injury
sustained,
i
thorough
--
i
agree
thoroughly
with
the
principle
he
has
stated,
but
that
only
leaves
--
that
leaves
only
stefanelli
versus
minard
342
u.s.
117.
and
the
question
of
the
nicety
of
the
exercise
of
federal
equity
jurisdiction
and
left
--
left
to
have
give
us
pause,
but
stefanelli
recognizes
the
jurisdiction
of
equity
and
emphasizes
only
the
restraint
which
a
federal
court
show
against
interfere
with
the
state
criminal
process.
i
agree
whole
heartedly
but
answer
as
was
asked
with
respect
to
little
rock
school,
martial-law
and
then
texas
oil
fields,
another
historical
federal-state
clashes
when
does
enough
of
federal
law
violation
become
too
much?
the
fact
rehires
above
demonstrates
in
my
opinion
that
the
only
--
that
only
by
the
course
of
federal
injunction
will
the
present
and
past
be
resolved.
schwartz
versus
texas
shows
that
the
way
is
not
by
appeal
from
a
conviction
already
had.
indeed
it
confirms
the
view
that
this
is
the
only
--
that
this
is
the
one
healthy
and
direct
and
complete
solution.
a
clean
excision
is
better
than
a
continuous
manner.
involving
stefanelli
was
an
isolated
case
of
federal
law
violation,
not
a
consistent
pattern
as
here.
also,
to
be
noticed
the
less
directed
direct
compulsion
of
federal
law
the
essence
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
touch
the
problem
of
communication
and
evidence
--
as
evidence
is
direct.
no
federal
claim
there
was
involved
and
that
damage
had
already
been
done.
carefully
consider,
our
regards
to
stefanelli
is
authority
shown
than
need
and
the
utility
of
the
action
i
urge
rather
that
the
controversy.
and
then
it
goes
on
consequently
i'm
persuaded
by
would
follow
the
good
opinion
judge
medina
upon
the
grant
of
stay
in
this
case.
i
also
note
that
two
state
justices
have
reached
like
conclusion
the
--
and
declined
proceeds
further
in
wiretapping
and
then
refers
to
the
hubsteder
and
judge
davis.
this
case
not
only
illustrates
the
uncertain
and
anomalous
position
that
which
state
judges
now
trust,
but
also
a
good
example
to
united
state
judges.
in
the
first
case
cited
here
mr.
justice
hubsteder
makes
a
very
pointed
illusion
to
the
mandate
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
the
laws
made
pursuant
to
it,
are
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
binding
upon
us
all,
anything
in
the
constitutional
laws
of
any
state
of
the
contrary.
for
my
--
and
it
further
states
--
for
my
part
--
no
and
it
further
state
this
reminder
from
a
distinguished
state
board
of
the
necessity
for
obedience
of
the
supreme
law
or
to
go
far
to
a
later
fear
expressed
that
state
official
will
defy
this
law.
even
after
there's
been
(inaudible)
defying
in
the
cause
of
this
litigation
and
that
the
fellow
cause
would
be
flooded
with
action
that
curve
this
defiance.
on
my
part,
i
entertain
no
such
fear
of
violent
defiance
or
the
flood
of
cases
and
then
as
i
full
comment,
i
forgo
comment
on
the
implication
of
mere
number
of
application
may
bar
the
right
of
equity
relief.
on
the
contrary,
i
venture
to
believe
that
our
state
brothers
and
colleagues
in
law
enforcement,
more
than
a
bench
in
the
prosecuting
office
will
work
definitive
resolution
of
the
present
hopeless
stalemate
and
will
haste
come
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
law
as
soon
as
they
are
made
clear.
your
honor,
i
want
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
time
for
rebuttal,
so
i'm
going
to
stop
at
this
point.
mr.
george
j.
todaro
i
just
would
like
to
make
a
few
remarks
in
regard
to
mr.
dillon's
argument,
the
factual
argument
is
to
the
so-called
(inaudible)
i
submit
that
that
is
all
(inaudible)
the
record,
because
there's
nothing
on
the
record
in
this
case
and
if
--
if
i
went
to
argue
the
position
of
that
case,
i
would
have
to
take
the
case
in
its
entirety
and
bring
the
--
the
record
up
here
for
this
court
to
pursue
to
see
what
actually
transpired
in
that
case.
not
only
was
there
a
violation
of
605,
but
a
definite
violation
under
footnote
6
of
benanti.
i'm
relying
a
great
deal
on
benanti
i
suppose
i
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
yes,
your
honor.
now
i'm
going
[laughter]
therefore,
i
like
it,
so
to
speak.
i
concurred
with
the
rest
of
the
court
in
that
case.[laughter]
and
now
--
mr.
george
j.
todaro
[laughs]
if
i
may
bother
this
court
with
one
more
quotation
in
benanti
and
then
i
will
leave.
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
the
stefanelli
versus
minard
and
i
agree
with
this
stefanelli
case
that
it
would
leave
the
state
open
of
flanking
attacks
of
various
type
on
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
vague
and
uncertain
and
so
on.
i
agree
completely
with
that,
but
that
far
the
trouble
with
most
of
the
district
attorneys
and
that
includes
the
brief
filed
by
the
attorney
general
of
new
york,
that
they
like
in
this
case
to
illegal
search
and
seizure.
they
think,
they're
treated
alike
as
if
there
was
a
constitutional
issue
under
the
fourth
amendment
that's
involved.
but
here,
it
isn't
a
--
a
vague
constitutional
amendment
that's
involved,
but
a
specific
act
that's
clear,
concise,
and
crystal
clear.
and
benanti
said
this,
with
reference
to
that.
furthermore,
confront
as
we
are
with
this
clear
statute
and
resting
our
decision
on
its
provision,
it
is
not
unnecessary
nor
appropriate
to
discuss
by
analogy
the
distinction
suggested
to
be
applicable
to
the
fourth
amendment.
section
6
so
confide,
contains
an
express
absolute
prohibition
against
the
divulgence
of
the
wiretap
and
with
that
i
will
close
my
argument.
thank
you
very
much.
