mr.
walter
e.
dillon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
propose
to
give
you
the
facts
and
to
argue
point
one.
our
other
contentions
set
forth
in
the
brief,
will
be
argued
by
my
associate,
mr.
anolik.
on
june
15th,
1959,
linda
riss,
an
unmarried
female,
opened
the
door
of
her
apartment
in
response
to
the
bell.
as
she
held
the
door
ajar,
two
men
forced
their
way
in
across
the
threshold,
one
of
them
had
a
can
of
liquid
lye.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
which
he
threw
at
--
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
a
can
of
liquid
lye
which
he
threw
into
the
face
of
ms.
riss
as
a
result
of
which,
she
was
blinded
in
one
eye,
the
sight
of
the
other
was
impaired
and
her
face
and
head
were
otherwise
disfigured.
now
when
ms.
riss
was
able
to
be
interviewed,
she
told
the
police
that
she
had
been
courted
for
several
months
by
the
petitioner,
burton
pugach.
that
when
she
discovered
that
pugach
was
a
married
man
with
a
child,
she
made
it
known
to
him
that
she
was
no
longer
interested
in
his
--
in
her
--
in
his
affections.
pugach
told
her
that
she
would
receive
the
same
treatment
as
was
given
to
victor
riesel,
the
innuendo,
especially
in
the
light
of
subsequent
developments,
was
clear.
victor
riesel
was
a
newspaperman
in
new
york,
who
had
written
a
series
of
articles
on
gangster
control
of
certain
labor
unions.
by
way
of
reappraisal,
those
gangsters
threw
acid
into
riesel's
eyes
and
he
was
blinded.
from
the
very
inception
of
this
case,
pugach
was
the
prime
--
suspect
and
he
knew
it
if
from
no
other
source
the
widespread
newspaper
accounts
of
this
heinous
crime.
about
four
months
later,
after
the
police
had
completed
their
investigation,
they
placed
under
arrest
on
the
same
day
at
the
same
time,
but
at
different
places,
the
petitioner,
the
two
men
who
had
thrown
the
acid
and
one
of
them
who
had
aided
and
abetted
in
the
commission
of
this
crime.
at
the
time
that
pugach
was
apprehended,
he
had
concealed
upon
his
person
a
loaded
firearm
for
which
he
had
no
license.
the
grand
jury
of
bronx
county
indicted
pugach
and
his
three
confederates
for
the
crime
of
maim
--
maiming.
under
another
indictment
against
pugach
individually,
they
charged
him
with
a
violation
of
1897
of
the
penal
law,
carrying
a
concealed
weapon,
which
is
a
felony
in
new
york.
the
indictment
for
the
maiming
was
first
moved
for
trial
and
it
was
set
down
to
proceed
on
january
7th,
1960.
about
a
week
before
it
was
to
start,
the
present
action
was
brought
by
petitioner
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district.
together
with
his
complainant,
petitioner
served
papers
on
a
motion
for
an
injunction
pendente
lite.
the
respondents
cross-moved
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
action
was
not
maintainable.
judge
bryant
who
had
the
motion,
denied
the
temporary
injunction
and
he
granted
the
cross-motion
and
judgment
was
rendered
accordingly
and
appeal
was
taken
and
both
that
order
and
judgment
were
affirmed
at
the
circuit
court
or
by
the
circuit
court.
now
petitioner
in
his
brief
tells
this
court
that
the
respondents
do
not
deny
that
they
intercepted
telephone
conversations
on
--
on
his
office
telephone,
that
they
do
not
deny
that
they
introduced
that
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
of
bronx
county
as
a
result
of
which
two
--
the
two
indictments
were
lodged
against
him.
the
petitioner
further
tells
this
court
that
the
district
attorney
does
not
deny
that
he
intends
to
use
this
wiretap
evidence
at
the
trial
of
the
two
indictments.
petitioner
does
not
claim
to
a
single
fact
in
the
record,
which
in
any
way
supports
those
claims.
he
merely
says
that
in
the
opinions
of
judges
medina
and
chief
judge
lumbard
that
is
the
way
they
stated
the
facts,
that
the
district
attorney
did
not
make
the
--
a
denial
of
the
petitioner's
claims.
now
respondents
respectfully
maintain
that
to
save
that
the
district
attorney
did
not
deny
the
petitioner's
claims,
as
though
we
were
admitting
them,
is
grossly
unfair.
this
petitioner
knows
that
at
the
outset
of
the
action,
our
cross-motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
was
granted.
as
a
consequence,
there
was
no
need
to
take
issue
with
any
of
the
claims
asserted
by
petitioner
in
his
complaint.
no
answer
is
good
enough
for
a
complaint
that
is
legally
insufficient.
i
think
it
is
a
well-established
principle
that
in
order
to
secure
an
injunction,
you
must
show
that
you
have
a
clear
legal
right.
now
that
could
be
demonstrated
either
by
the
allegations
of
a
complaint
or
by
extrinsic
evidence
contained
in
affidavits.
we
say
that
there
is
no
attempt
at
compliance
with
these
prerequisites
in
the
papers
before
this
court.
there
are
only
two
allegations
that
are
worthy
of
consideration.
one,
petitioner
alleges
that
the
district
attorney
into
those
wiretap
evidence
before
the
grand
jury,
as
result
of
which
the
two
indictments
were
lodged
against
him.
the
other
allegation
is
upon
information
and
belief
that
the
district
attorney
intends
to
introduce
wiretap
evidence,
not
contends
with
to,
but
intends
to
use
wiretap
evidence
at
the
trial
of
those
two
indictments.
we
say
that
the
claim
that
the
district
attorney
introduced
wiretap
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
is
obviously
based
upon
conjecture.
grand
jury
testimony
is
secret
and
can
only
be
divulged
by
an
order
of
the
court.
this
petitioner
does
not
claim
that
he
ever
inspected
the
grand
jury
minutes,
as
a
consequence
when
he
tells
you
that
such
evidence
was
presented
before
the
grand
jury,
he's
merely
guessing.
he
hasn't
the
slightest
idea.
so
far
as
the
other
allegation
that
i
mentioned
that
petitioner
believes
that
the
district
attorney
intends
to
introduce,
intends
to
use
wiretap
evidence,
we
say
that
that
is
not
entitled
to
any
consideration.
how
could
the
respondents
deny
what
the
petitioner
believes
unless
he
sets
forth
the
facts
upon
which
that
belief
is
based?
what
did
the
district
attorney
ever
say?
what
did
the
district
attorney
ever
do
to
justify
that
claim?
and
to
justify
it,
the
temporary
injunctions
which
have
been
granted
by
the
federal
court,
i
meant
the
circuit
court
and
which
are
still
in
existence.
those
injunctions
restrained
the
district
attorney
or
respondents
whereof
introducing
any
wiretap
evidence
at
the
trial
of
either
of
those
two
indictments
and
while
the
first
conjunction
was
in
effect,
the
district
attorney
proceeded
with
the
trial
of
the
indictment
charging
the
defendant
with
carrying
a
loaded
firearm
in
violation
of
the
penal
law.
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty.
on
page
15
of
my
brief,
i
have
set
forth
a
resume
of
the
undisputed,
the
unchallenged
evidence
at
that
trial
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
police
secured
their
information
leading
to
at
least
upon
which
that
indictment
was
based.
i
think
that
when
you
read
those
facts,
you
will
see
that
the
defendant
was
not
very
candid
with
the
federal
court.
i
believe
too
that
you
will
be
convinced
that
the
claim
of
wiretapping
in
relation
to
that
particular
indictment
is
not
just
devoid
of
merit,
but
it
is
simply
ludicrous.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
ludicrous,
amusingly
absurd.
under
point
(1)
of
our
brief,
we
urged
that
the
federal
courts
should
not
intervene
at
state
criminal
proceedings
to
suppress
evidence.
now
that
was
the
basis
of
the
holding
of
the
circuit
court
and
that
was
on
the
authority
of
stefanelli
against
minard.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
the
status
of
the
other
indictment
is
that
--
that
is
presently
awaiting
trial
and
that
it
has
been
delayed
on
account
of
the
injunctions
that
were
granted.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
no,
no,
the
circuit
court,
not
the
sixth
court
of
appeals,
second
circuit,
from
the
appeals
taken.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
well
--
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
strictly
speaking
--
strictly
speaking,
there
was
nothing
to
state
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
they
are
temporary
injunction.
there's
nothing
to
state.
well,
it's
called
a
stay.
we
--
i
--
i
might
say
that
we
have
never
divulged
any
of
our
evidence
in
relation
to
the
maiming
indictment
which
is
not
--
which
has
not
been
disposed
of.
however,
we
have
made
persistent
efforts
to
proceed
with
the
trial
of
that
action
and
we've
been
bought
effectively.
now
--
where
--
i
don't
like
to
complain
about
what
the
petitioner
has
done,
well,
he
has
the
job
to
do
and
we
can
well
understand
that.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
oh
no,
oh
no.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
that's
i
--i
made
that
--
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
that's
right.
at
least,
we
felt
that
way.
and
--
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
that's
right.
in
fact,
we
made
known
--
we
made
that
fact
known
to
the
court,
united
states
court
of
appeals.
there
was
an
application
that
was
made
following
judge
medina's
temporary
injunction,
you
might
say,
the
one
on
which
he
will
depend.
there
was
another
proceeding,
i
would
say
about
a
week
after
that
and
we've
made
known
the
fact
that
we
were
about
to
proceed
with
that
trial.
now,
incidentally
in
the
brief
of
the
--
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner,
he
tells
you
that
we
didn't
even
give
him
a
chance
to
prepare
for
the
trial
of
that
indictment
on
the
weapon
charge.
well,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is,
he
had
four
months
to
prepare.
he
had
two
weeks
notice
that
the
trial
was
going
to
start.
he
was
represented
by
two
able
counsel
one,
a
former
jurist.
he,
himself
is
in
an
attorney
and
you
have
the
simple
issue
as
to
whether
he
had
a
loaded
firearm
concealed
on
his
person
at
10:30
in
the
morning,
on
october
30th,
1959,
i
don't
think
we
were
unreasonable.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
he
says
--
he
said
in
his
complaint
and
in
his
supporting
affidavit
that
this
was
divulged
to
the
press,
press.
how
can
we
--
how
could
we
possibly
refute
that?
what
does
he
mean
by
the
press?
it
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
tell
us
anything.
he
might
just
well
have
said
â€“
it
was
revealed
to
the
world.
now
petitioner
contends
that
it's
definitely
in
my
argument
as
i
think
circumscribed
on
the
stefanelli
case,
because
that's
our
point
one,
he
says
that
stefanelli
is
distinguishable
in
two
respects.
one
of
them
is
in
a
rather
vague
fashion,
that
he
suggests
that
under
a
new
concept
of
ordered
liberty
which
has
its
core
in
the
fourth
amendment
in
foston
against
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
he
had
a
basic
right
of
privacy
in
a
--
telephonic
communication.
that's
his
theory
and
he
then
proceeds
in
his
argument
to
tie
that
fundamental
right
in
with
section
605.
well,
if
he
has
a
fundamental
right
of
privacy
in
a
telephone
conversation,
which
we
certainly
concede,
he
didn't
get
that
right
from
congress
under
section
605.
that
was
that
the
visions
of
605
would
not
be
applicable
to
a
fundamental
right.
moreover,
if
he
had
a
fundamental
right,
since
he
concedes
that
the
so-called
intrusion
by
the
police
was
by
order
of
the
state
court,
then
it
would
not
have
been
an
illegal
search.
it
would
be
exactly
--
it
would
be
a
lawful
search
and
he'd
have
no
claim,
but
even
if
it
were
an
illegal
search,
the
situation
would
be
identical
to
that
which
you
had
in
the
stefanelli
case.
his
other
claim
is
that
this
differs
from
stefanelli
because
the
state
affirmatively
sanctioned
the
wrongful
intrusion
by
the
police.
now
for
that
argument,
he
relies
upon
the
statements
and
the
opinion
of
judge
medina
that
is
on
the
--
granting
the
temporary
injunction
and
upon
--
and
upon
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
clark.
now
the
gist
of
their
thoughts,
that
is
the
thoughts
expressed
by
those
judges,
is
that
the
--
the
visions
of
new
york's
constitution
and
the
statutes
dealing
with
wiretaps,
no,
wiretapping,
the
granting
of
orders
under
a
constitutional
provision
and
legislation
and
the
introduction
of
wiretap
evidence
at
a
trial
with
as
they
say,
the
full
knowledge
on
the
part
of
prosecutor
that
that
is
--
that
a
--
is
a
direct
violation
of
section
605
and
a
criminal
act.
they
seem
to
think
that
that
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
an
overall
scheme
on
the
part
of
new
york
to
defy
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
now,
i
think
that
the
indictment
against
the
public
officials
of
new
york
in
that
respect
is
not
warranted.
before
this
case
came
along,
it
had
always
been
my
view
that
it
was
not
unlawful
to
introduce
wiretap
evidence
at
a
trial
of
an
indictment
in
the
state
court.
i
--
i
didn't
pick
that
idea
out
of
the
thin
air.
i
think
it
was
the
general
view
in
new
york.
in
fact,
in
people
against
variano,
which
was
the
last
pronouncement
by
our
highest
court
on
the
subject
which
was
decided
in
april
1959,
the
court
of
appeals
had
this
to
say
hence
rather
short,
"a
state
policy
of
admitting
evidence,
having
prohibitive
force
even
though
obtained
illegally,
does
not
contravene
federal
law,
schwartz
against
texas,
344
u.s.
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
by
chief
justice
warren
in
the
benanti
case,
supra,
page
101,
says
concerning
the
schwartz
case,
the
rationale
of
that
case
is
that
despite
the
plain
prohibition
of
section
605
do
regard
for
a
--
for
federal
state
relations,
precluded
the
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
thwart
a
state
rule
of
evidence
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
indication
to
that
effect.
in
other
words,
we
are
told
that
the
prohibition
of
section
605
was
not
intended
by
congress
to
prevent
the
introduction
of
wiretap
evidence
at
a
state
trial.
that
can
hardly
be
said
in
the
light
of
that
language
that
new
york's
practice
was
in
defiance
or
hostile
to
federal
law.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
people
against
variano,
v.a.r.i.a.n.o,
that's
5
n.y.
2d,
decided
in
april
1959.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
you
mean
in
that,
he
participates
in
the
divulging?
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
of
course
that's
not
the
file
--
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
--
that
is
(inaudible).
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
wish
to
overlap
on
this
(inaudible).
as
i
told
you
a
moment
ago,
i'm
--
i'm
arguing
point
one.
i
don't
--
i
don't
exactly
subscribe
to
what
you
say
judge
harlan.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
you
mean
that
we
couldn't
prosecute?
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
that's
right.
in
other
words
--
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
that's
what
--
that's
what
--
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
that's
right.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
just
which
case
it
is?
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
carr
--
parr
--
that's
it
parr.
mr.
anolik,
says,
he's
committed
with
that,
i'm
not.
mr.
walter
e.
dillon
no,
definitely,
we
couldn't
prosecute.
moreover,
this
suggestion
that
new
york
law
and
that
is
our
constitutional
provision
is
hostile
at
--
to
605
is
something
that's
hard
--
that
it
is
hard
to
accept.
i
would
say
that
section
--
at
least
our
constitutional
provision
and
our
legislation
is
in
aid
of
section
605
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
--
nothing
in
our
legislation
which
would
suggest
that
there
was
any
intent
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
15
million
people.
incidentally,
it
was
--
it
was
voted,
but
are
voted
on
by
the
people
in
the
1938
and
if
there
was
any
conspiracy
at
that
time
to
enact
this
or
at
least
to
pass
this
constitutional
provision
and
the
laws
that
were
passed
in
the
next
--
session
of
the
legislature
and
that
was
the
part
of
the
plan
to
defeat
the
605,
i'm
certain
that
i
would
have
recalled
that
but
i
never
made
anything
like
that
until
this
case
came
along.
in
any
event,
in
--
in
the
stefanelli
case,
you
spoke
about
the
consequences
which
would
flow
if
the
federal
courts
intervened
in
state
criminal
proceedings
to
suppress
the
use
of
evidence
when
claimed
to
have
been
secured
by
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
of
course,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
that,
i
--
i
am
sure
that
you
can
recall
what
justice
frankfurter
wrote
for
this
court
in
that
case.
chief
judge
lumbard
of
the
--
of
the
circuit
court,
also
commented
--
commented
upon
the
difficulties
which
would
--
which
would
be
encountered
by
allowing
actions
like
petitioners
to
--
to
be
maintained.
he
said,
the
district
courts
would
be
flooded
with
suits
for
injunctions
against
the
use
of
wiretap
evidence
and
its
alleged
fruits
in
the
state
courts
with
the
consequence
necessity
of
determining
just
what
evidence
was
proposed
to
be
introduced
and
whether
the
trial
had
reached
such
a
stage
that
vindication
of
the
federal
right
should
be
subordinated
to
practical
considerations
of
state
law
enforcement
and
all
these
determinations
would
be
subject
to
appeal.
now,
i
don't
think
that
chief
judge
lumbard
was
exaggerating
when
he
said
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
flooded
with
litigation
if
these
suits
were
permitted
to
be
maintained.
in
the
city
of
new
york,
i
would
say
that
there
are
at
least
--
at
least
75
judges
who
exercise
criminal
jurisdiction
exclusively.
there
are
other
judges
such
as
supreme
court
justices,
who
have
a
general
jurisdiction,
but
the
criminal
branch
on
the
supreme
court
is
really
activated.
you
have
also
judges
of
the
--
of
the
domestic
relations
court
that
have
limited
criminal
jurisdiction,
but
you
at
least
have
the
--
at
least
75
judges
in
the
city
courts.
now,
i
think
that
the
most
damaging
blow
which
would
result,
by
allowing
the
accused
in
a
state
action
--
in
a
state
action
to
examine
the
place
of
prosecutors
and
witnesses
to
determine
what
evidence
was
proposed
to
be
introduced
and
how
the
evidence
was
procured,
would
be
a
fatal
blow.
now,
how
--
how
aware
the
police
secured
their
information
is
highly
confidential,
if
we
were
required
to
disclose
that
source
of
information
to
an
accused
at
a
state
trial
in
the
federal
court.
the
source
of
information
would
completely
dry
up
immediately
and
few
crimes
would
be
solved.
now,
i
understand
my
time
is
up
and
i'll
stop
right
here,
unless
your
honors
have
some
questions.
