justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
that's
so
why
would
you
need
an
injunction?
if
--
if
you
argument
there
is
correct,
why
would
you
need
an
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
if
the
--
if
there's
a
conviction
brought
about
by
evidence
which
violates
the
in
federal
law
or
the
constitution,
then
the
conviction
is
subject
to
attack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
--
is
that
right
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
--
did
schwartz
versus
texas
say,
it
was
illegal
for
a
state
to
use
evidence
at
the
time
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
violated
the
federal
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
a
state
to
use
evidence
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
to
do
the
wiretapping
but
for
a
state
to
use
evidence
that
it
had
been
tapped,
did
schwartz
versus
texas
hold
that,
i
just
read
it
and
i
didn't
think
it
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
its
wrong
but
i
would
suggest
maybe
you'd
you
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
sure
but
if
you
would
argue
on
this
basis
â€“-
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
its
illegal
it
didn't
have
to
be
in
enjoined
because
if
its
illegal
and
valid
federal
law
it
could
be
raised
in
the
trial.
if
it's
not
illegal
for
this
prosecuting
attorney's
office,
can
he
be
enjoined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
before
i'm
--
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
your
argument
can
get
to
schwartz
at
this
time.
schwartz
held
that
is
not
illegal
for
the
state
use
to
it,
that
it
did
not
violate
the
federal
statute
of
the
constitution.
there
were
two
dissents,
one
on
constitutional
--
of
one
dissent
on
the
constitutional
ground,
but
the
opinion
of
the
court
held
that
is
was
not
illegal
for
texas
to
use
that,
it
didn't
violate
a
federal
law
or
the
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
that's
quite
of
different
thing
from
saying
that
the
statute
bars
the
prosecuting
attorney
from
offering
evidence,
offered
from
using
evidence,
if
the
court
did
not
hold
that
it
violated
the
federal
statute
to
use
that
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
confronted
--
you're
confronted
with
the
statute
which
congress
passed
which
did
not
say
that
this
shall
not
be
used
in
evidence
as
in
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
didn't
say
that
in
federal
courts,
but
the
court
held
under
its
supervisory
power
that
it
couldn't
be
used
in
federal
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it,
in
that
case
didn't
hold
that
the
man
could
be
prosecuted
for
violating
that
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
schwartz
versus
texas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
there
been
any
of
efforts
in
congress
to
amend
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
has
there
been
any
efforts
made
to
provide
that
one
who
violates
the
evidence
to
secure
that
way,
shall
be
barred
from
use
in
the
state
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
congress?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
to
you
is
maybe
it's
wrong
that
your
attack
is
on
court's
interpretation
of
the
act
(1)
and
schwartz
case
number
(2)
on
the
ground
that
the
court
didn't
the
dissenting
opinion,
because
the
act
does
not
say
on
the
face
that
evidence
shall
not
be
introduced
in
a
state
court
and
the
courts
held
that
they
actually
mean
that.
are
you're
attacking
the
schwartz
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
attacking
a
bad
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
simply
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
