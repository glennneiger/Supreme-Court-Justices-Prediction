mr.
james
d.
lopp
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen.
it
is
the
petition
--
position
here
that
we
do
feel
that
we
would
start
a
short
change
and
not
being
purported
this
argument
in
chicago
for
the
court
of
appeals.
we
feel
that
the
--
judge
castle,
with
all
sincerity
on
his
part,
should
have
--
had
the
opportunity
to
let
us
present
our
position
in
this
matter.
we've
had
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
given
to
this
case.
and
this
is
a
proper
case.
and
i
think
the
purpose
of
it
is,
is
for
a
complete
hearing.
now,
gentlemen,
i'd
like
to
get
one
thing
straight.
maybe
you
understand,
i
don't
know.
these
exhibits
here,
these
newspaper
in
exhibits,
those
were
attached
to
our
motions
for
continuances,
for
changes
of
venues.
they
were
not
newspaper
items
that
was
presented
and
shown
to
a
jury
at
all
during
the
course
of
this
trial.
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
mr.
lockyear
and
i
used
these
newspapers
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
a
continuance
and
for
the
change
of
venue.
"mr.
in-the-newspapers"
probably
would
say
here
that
mr.
irvin
want
to
change
the
story,
wanted
this
way
or
that
way
or
he
made
an
oral
statement
and
such.
now,
it's
just
like
this.
they
--
we
were
being
tried
to
this
court
right
today
here
and
there's
somebody
out
here
on
the
street
here
saw
the
newspapers
that
we've
made
a
--
a
confession
to
this
thing
or
we
want
to
change
our
story,
why,
and
these
jurors
were
passing
through
the
courtroom
here
and
read
those
things
is
going
to
have
an
effect
upon
their
judgment.
now,
that's
what
we
were
trying
to
avoid.
our
client
has
denied
those
statements.
he's
denied
a
confession
of
this
matter.
he's
denied
that
he
made
a
statement
that
the
--
to
the
newspaper
reporter
that
he
wanted
to
change
the
context
of
the
story
or
such
as
that.
we
had
made
an
offer
to
prove
here
during
the
course
of
this
trial
when
paul
weaver
took
that
witness
stand
and
when
each
one
of
those
witnesses
took
that
witness
stand.
we
objected
and
made
an
offer
to
prove
that
what
they've
obtained
and
what
they've
learned
was
illegal
because
of
the
length
of
time
that
this
man
was
in
this
jail.
he
hurry
the
time
when
he
was
arrested
on
april
the
8th
and
so
the
purported
confession
of
april
the
12th,
he
was
without
counsel
and
we
alleged
in
our
--
our
objections
here.
during
that
period
of
time,
before
mr.
weaver
want
to
testify
and
before
all
these
witnesses
(inaudible)
altered
wanted
to
testify,
we
made
a
--
an
objection
to
that
and
the
court
overruled
our
objection.
and
that
objection
was
in
--
in
substance,
it's
found
on
page
60
of
our
brief
here.
now,
the
police
officers
inflicted
physical
violence.
it
points
for
the
defendant
that
the
--
the
said
admission,
confession
has
stated
before
if
any
may
were
under
duress
and
fraud,
coercion,
that's
on
page
60.
on
page
60,
this
is
a
long
objection
we've
made.
this
objection
here
contained
about
10
pages
objection.
we
further
object
that
the
--
the
defendant
here
was
then
--
and
then
on
the
sole
and
absolute
(inaudible)
control
of
the
police
officers
and
had
been
with
up
--
the
street
and
rest
for
24
hours.
and
it
--
and
it
continues
to
enter
--
enter
question
at
any
statement
so
made
by
the
defendant
whether
oral
or
written
was
involuntary
given
and
was
made
given
under
inducement
and
under
influenced
of
fear
produced
by
threat,
intimidations
and
(inaudible)
fraud.
and
we
further
proceeded
here.
mr.
james
d.
lopp
that's
exactly
what
i
did,
is
try
to
find
cause
for
the
court,
your
honor.
everyone
of
those
witnesses,
those
police
officers
have
testified.
we
made
our
objection
to
them
and
an
offer
to
prove
that
--
that
very
thing
that
i
was
reading
to
the
court
this
and
this
and
saw
these
objections.
and
it's
found
on
page
60
of
our
brief
--
on
our
brief
and
it
continues
my
objections
here.
and
the
further,
the
illegal
in
this
that
upon
arresting
the
defendant,
the
police
officer
put
the
defendant
in
a
barring
cell
at
the
police
headquarter
at
the
city
of
evansville
and
a
sweatbox
room
and
kept
him
there
incommunicado
for
a
period
of
seven
days
and
submitted
him
to
every
unrelating
question
without
proper
rules
seeking
the
rest
and
still
taking
the
defendant
more
equipped
to
adjust
the
fees
or
the
court
having
proper
jurisdiction.
on
page
66,
we
continue
that
he
was
denied
the
right
to
be
advised
of
his
legal
rights
by
a
counsel
--
a
counsel
or
a
lawyer
appointed
by
the
court
of
law
to
represent
him
at
any
time
--
the
--
at
any
time.
the
said
defendant
was
never
brought
before
any
magistrate
or
a
court
of
law
and
advised
of
his
rights
to
counsel
and
have
counsel
appointed
to
him
or
represent
him
during
those
seven
long
days
he
was
held
in
a
city
jail
at
the
city
of
evansville.
and
that
is
the
truth
that
speaks
the
record
that
this
defendant
was
held
in
the
city
of
evansville
for
that
length
of
time.
i
want
to
call
your
attention
whether
he
was
eventually
called
by
the
city
court
just
what
the
judge
said.
now,
i
find
within
the
city
court
there
where
they
had
irvin
was
downstairs
below,
right
up
above,
there's
a
city
judge,
the
city
--
the
city
court
of
the
city
of
evansville.
they
have
all
this
time
locked
up
in
a
cell
where
you
could
open
the
door
and
walk
around
to
the
city
courtroom
for
a
purpose
of
arraignment.
he
was
finally
brought
in
there
and
hear
on
judge
(inaudible)
was
the
judge.
and
we
asked
judge
(inaudible)
there
just
one
time.
was
the
defendant
represented
by
an
attorney
at
that
time?
no.
he
was
in
the
custody
of
the
police
officer
of
the
city
of
evansville
at
that
time.
question,
"did
you
advise
him
at
that
time
he
was
entitled
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney?"
answer,
"i
don't
think
so,"
and
so
many
words.
he
was
just
asked
whether
he
weighed
a
hearing
on
a
preliminary
charge.
question,
"and
that
was
all
that
was
said?"
answer,
"that's
right."
now,
that's
what
judge
(inaudible)
says.
that's
found
on
this
record
here
and
this
man
was
never
afforded
a
counsel.
and
each
time
these
witnesses
who
testified,
we
made
our
proper
objection
and
an
offer
to
prove
all
that
is
set
out
in
our
brief
here
beginning
on
page
16
and
ending
on
page
67.

mr.

your

at

false
idea.
i
don't
know

i
am

speaking
with
experience.
we
have
the
false
idea.
maybe
i

i
wasn't

when
this
trial
was
actually
(inaudible)
mr.

was
a
regular
public
defender
was
representative
at
that
time.
and
it
was
just
sent

they
have
a
false
idea
that
the
most
convenient
county
would
be
the
adjoining
county
which
is
not
true.
and
therefore
--
and
so
they
(inaudible)
judge
sent
to
--
to
gibson
county,
and
judge
--
the
circuit
judge
had
testified
here.
we
tried
to
get
this
thing
frankly
remanded.
that
this
was
solved.
we
tried
to
get
this
thing
remanded
in
one
sense
because
we
felt
there
was
error
in
sending
that
to
gibson
county.
mr.
james

for
several
purposes.
gibson
county
was
a
little
small
county
where
the
total
population
is
30
--
at
approximately
30,000
people,
your
honor.
what
we
want
to
do
was
to
get
this
thing
back
in
a
status
quo
and
we've
got
to
look
forward
in
this
case
that
it's
been
a
point.
but
we
felt
that
the
court

it
to
gibson
county.
mr.
james

lopp
we
want
to
get
back
to
evansville
and
start
in
because
evansville
--
we

obviously
we've
had
a
better
chance
factor
at
evansville
where
we
prefer
to
get
the
better
jury
with
the
--
with
the
population
of
150,000
people
and
we
put
in
a
little
community
where
there's
30,000
people
in
the
entire
county
where
they're
all
related
and
know
one
another,
and
they
--
and
that
was
our
position.
we
want
to
get
it
--
try
to
get
back
in
vanderburgh
county
so
that
we
could
go
properly
forward
and
then

and
they

up
there
in

as
they

or
whatnot,
they
brought
him
back
to
the
city
of
evansville
and
he
brought

took
him
to
the
city
police
station.
they
did
not
take
him
to

of
vanderburgh
county
at
all.
they
kept
him
there
from
april
the
8th
to

finally
on

was
when

but
he
was
not

and
then
he
was
not

until

on

he
was

then
the
matter

was
continued
until

when
the

so
you've
been

20
days

you're

i

could
be
done
in
several
ways.
in
other
words,
if
he
did
not

his

he
didn't
do
anything
at

i

that
the

had

he
can
file
petition
for
writ

habeas

to
get
out
if
we
didn't
do
anything
about
this
parole.
other
than
that,
i

he
was
being
assured,
he'd
been
entitled
to
hearing
before
the
parole
board.
now,
i

other
than
that,
i
just
wouldn't
want
to

i

that

this

where
we
move

our

he

brother
or
some

one

the

there
is
one

thinks,
"well
now,
wait
if
john
jones
thinks
he's
guilty,
i
know
john
jones,
why,
maybe

i'm
thinking
wrong
here."
and
after
so
long
of
time,
that's
going
to
build
us
in
your
mind
if
you
keep
saying
somebody
is
guilty,
somebody
is
guilty
431
times
you're
almost,
why,
you're
going

on
that
spies
case,
what
you
said

i
remembered
also,
the
jurors
had
not

their
opinions.
now,
in
this
case,
these
jurors
had
expressed
their
opinions
and
some
of
them,
to
the
extent
of
everything

fixed
stability.
mr.

death

i
think
irrespective

as
far
as
our
constitution
comes
first,
the
question
is
whether
the

not

qualifying

some
particular

it's
qualifying
him

manner.
