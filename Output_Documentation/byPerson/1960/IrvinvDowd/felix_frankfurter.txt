justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
be
good
enough
to
hand
that
to
the
clerk?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
will
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
your
speech,
the
determination
of
the
sentence,
does
the
jury
recommend
whether
it
should
be
death
penalty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
does
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
must
have
make
an
affirmative
recommendation
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
or
must
have
make
a
recommendation
which
then
litigate
to
death
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
fixed
the
penalty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
can
they
fix
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
life
or
death.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
couldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
interrupt
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
have
solicited
so
i
didn't
hear
it
that
irvin
authorized
chief
hughes
to
release
his
version.
he's
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
record.
the
paper
which
printed
it
says
this
is
on
--
with
the
permission
of
--
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
it
was
true,
how
would
that
affect
your
argument
that
this
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
an
unborn
interference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
you
must
--
then
we
must
assume
it
isn't
true
that
he
authorized
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
were
these
--
these
newspaper
accounts
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
if
the
newspaper
account
was
in
the
record,
that
carries
with
it
the
statements
that
this
was
with
irvin's
permission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
we
can
take
part
of
the
paper
and
say,
"this
is
terrible."
and
say
we
assume
he
didn't
authorize
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
don't
you
take
the
whole
--
and
now
aren't
you
chargeable
with
the
whole
document?
how
could
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you're
complaining
prejudice
because
of
this
exhibit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
we
look
at
the
exhibits.
and
we
look
at
the
exhibit
and
find
that
it
says
that
irvin
gave
permission
for
this
release.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
can't
cut
it
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
all
different
issues.
you
are
trying
to
challenge
the
fairness
of
the
trial
because
of
the
exhibits
you
put
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
exhibit
on
its
face
showed
what
was
--
what
you
complained
of
was
done
with
the
consent
and
permission
of
the
defendant.
now,
it
wasn't
too
difficult
for
a
counsel
to
have
said
--
who
have
said,
"we
challenge
that
part
of
the
statement.
we
can't
challenge
the
statements
that
it
was
printed
because
there
it
is."
but
that
(inaudible)
profit,
real
evidence,
but
you
could
easily
--
easily
could
have
said,
"we
should
like
to
state
that
is
not
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
just
indicated
that
if
he
gave
permission
for
disseminating
this
--
embarrassing
stuff,
things
that
i
personally
greatly
deprecate,
then
--
then
we
can
assume
that
he
didn't
get
permission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
we
can
go
to
the
point
that
isn't
presumptively,
everything
in
newspaper
is
false,
can
we.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can
--
we
can
say
that
what
you're
complaining
of
doesn't
bear
out
your
complaint.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
attributed
to
the
police
chief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
a
different
story.
i'm
addressing
myself
to
the
exhibit
which
justice
black
happens
to
have
understand.
what's
the
name
of
the
newspaper?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
days
in
a
--
well,
for
how
many
days
was
that
kind
of
front
page
publicity
given
to
the
crime
with
which
he
was
charged
plus
other
crimes?
how
many
such
issues
--
how
many
times
did
the
--
did
men
and
women
of
this
town,
evansville
open
their
papers
and
find
out
on
the
front
page?
justice
felix
frankfurter
day
after
day?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
means
he
has
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
merely
as
to
the
so-called
confession
but
other
matters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
there
other
matters
that
the
chief
of
police
released
to
the
press
as
to
which
there
was
no
attribution
of
his
permission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
matters
that
weren't
--
that
did
not
appear
in
court
and
pursuits
on
them
couldn't
have
appeared
in
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
does
the
--
do
those
printings
say
that
the
chief
of
police
gave
for
the
vehicle
of
communication?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
prosecutor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
they
called
him
for?
what
he
was
going
to
prove?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lockyear,
does
your
brief
sets
forth,
hereby
quoting
by
reference,
statements
in
newspapers
in
evansville
or
elsewhere
from
the
vicinity
setting
forth
communications
made
by
the
police
authorities
and
or
the
prosecutors
manners
that
were
not,
and
from
point
of
view
of
the
law,
couldn't
have
been
introduced
into
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
do
that?
could
that
be
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
chief
justice?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
set
it
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
you
set
it
out,
you
set
it
out
but
that
you
get
the
--
the
precise
details?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
the
--
indicating
whether
it's
front
page,
the
--
the
days,
the
specific
days
and
specific
papers,
the
specific
things
that
the
chief
--
that
the
police
authorities
or
the
prosecuting
authorities
are
both
together
gave
to
the
press
matters
which
were
not
subsequently
or
could
not
have
been
as
a
matter
of
law
introduced
to
this
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
your
argument.
could
you
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
population
of
evansville?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
area.
justice

page

justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
whether
what
mr.
weaver
testified
to
if
it
had
been
testified
to
by
a
non-prosecutor,
would
--
would
it
have
been
relevant
and
admissible
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
subject
matter
of
his
testimony
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
want
to
know
whether
they
were
object
--
relevant
objection
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
he
was
a
prosecutor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
whether
if
it
was
made
by
a
neutral
person,
would
that
have
been
--
would
--
would
that
testimony
had
been
ground
for
urging
want
of
due
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
--
i
merely
forget
that
he
was
a
prosecutor.
if
mr.
jones
not
mr.
weaver
goes
on
the
witness
stand
and
testifies
to
everything
that
weaver
testified,
would
that
have
given
you
ground
for
urging
that
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
in
admitting
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
size
of
the
venire
that
was
called?
how
many
--
how
many
prospective
jurors
were
actually
called
and
examined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
100?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
were
examined?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
on
the
voir
dire?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
those
431,
how
many
has
said
that
an
unshakable
conviction
of
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
take
it,
mr.
givan,
you've
been
through
the
record
--
the
exhibits
in
the
record,
the
whole
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
that
assumption,
i
meant
the
fact
rather,
would
you
eager
enough
to
state
--
give
an
estimate,
how
many
issues
of
front
page
story
carrying
matters
that
were
not
received
or
offered
in
evansville,
leaving
to
one
side
whether
they
could
or
couldn't,
matters
that
were
not
in
fact
introduced
before
the
jury
but
dealt
with
in
newspaper
article
on
the
front
page
of
the
evansville
courier
and
in
any
other
paper
as
to
which
--
as
to
which
it
was
indicated
that
the
police
or
the
prosecutorial
officers
immediately
stopped
and
as
to
which
there
was
no
indication
of
irvin
himself
gave
permission
for
its
printing.
on
your
mind,
how
many
such
daily
occurrences
issued
the
paper
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
what
scale
were
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
five,
one
or
10?
justice
felix
frankfurter
take
the
evansville
courier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
impression
left
on
your
mind
one
could
go
to
the
record
and
examine
it
as
in
statistically,
was
this
once
or
several
times,
half
a
dozen
times
or
a
dozen
times?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
many
instances
did
they
profess
to
quote
the
officials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
frequent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
these
--
all
these
newspaper
accounts
that
they're
objected
to
made
the
basis
of
a
claim
of
inflammatoriness
resulting
in
unfairness
amounting
to
due
process.
they
were
all
put
in
evidence,
were
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
an
effort
resulting
to
the
state
to
challenge
the
claims
that
these
were
inspired
articles,
was
it
not?
it
was
open
to
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
many
instances
in
the
instances
in
which
the
papers
purported,
you
have
derived
their
information
from
officials,
did
the
state
say
that
that
was
not
a
truthful
statement?
is
that
up
here
in
the
record
that
that
disavowed
responsibility
of
the
--
the
inition
of
these
things
to
official
miles?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
think
--
would
you
think
it
was
suggesting
an
unattainable
standard
for
american
criminal
justice
that
when
a
sensational
--
when
sensational
crimes
like
this
occur
and
naturally
there's
great
publicity
about
the
occurrence
that
when
the
authority
eventually
find
the
culprit
and
feeling
in
the
community
had
run
high
regarding
the
crime
that
then
it's
almost
the
duty
to
take
great
care
not
to
continue
this
feeling
against
the
particular
defendant.
would
you
think
that
was
too
high
a
standard
to
set?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
between
binding
them
to
silence
and
actually
having
him
take
affirmative
steps
to
feed
stuff
to
the
press
as
a
rather
long
distance,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
alright,
the
word
feeding
carries
a
whole
salient
implications
but
wasn't
it
a
fact
--
isn't
it
a
fact
that
both
the
police
authorities
and
the
prosecutors
did
give
statements
to
the
press
regarding
matters
that
they
didn't
and
one
can
say,
in
many
instances,
that
couldn't
have
introduced
before
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
say
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
--
but
what
about
the
giving
to
the
press
matters
as
to
other
crime
which
could
not
be
introduced
in
the
prosecution
of
this
crime?were
there
such
instances?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
givan
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
--
i
take
it
you
will
comment
on
mr.
lockyear's
memorandum,
which
he
is
to
file,
indicating
your
view
as
to
the
newspaper
item
that
which
he
complained
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
were
attributable
through
initiating
emissions
or
--
or
communication
by
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
other
authorities
which
can
have
both
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
we
can
find
out
which
of
these
newspaper
arguments
were
originated
with
the
newspapers'
interest
in
exploiting
a
crime,
there's
--
there
are
a
lot
of
--
to
do
in
this
country,
to
my
horror,
and
which
was
stimulated
by
the
authorities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
somebody
must
authorize
the
newspaper
people
to
go
inside
the
cell
or
have
they
got
a
reception
room
and
have
tea
and
generally
make
life
pleasant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
people
can't
go
into
a
cell
without
the
warden's
authorization,
can
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must
give
him
permission.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
sheriff
--
is
the
sheriff
an
elected
--
would
this
sheriff
had
been
an
elected
official?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
wants
--
he
would
want
to
stand
as
well
with
the
boys,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
it's
a
nice
marshall
for
newspaper
people
to
be
interviewing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
well,
if
charged
with
a
capital
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
long
as
this
is
allowed,
it
will
happen
of
course.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
remark,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
is
not
an
unusual
statute
(inaudible)
any
phrase
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
no
such
--
and
then
--
there's
no
comparable
situation
in
--
in
the
record
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
--
i
--
i
understood
that
there
were
statements
that
appeared
and
were
issued
for
interviews
by
statements
by
some
officials
as
to
other
crimes
of
--
of
irvin.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
was
given
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'd
be
the
last
person
to
deny
it,
the
usual
phrase
a
minute
ago
that
if
publicity
is
given
against
the
man
who
is
charged
with
murder
a,
a
publicity
has
given
that
he
committed
murders
b,
c
and
d,
it
is
bound
to
stir
in
the
minds
of
the
readers
of
that
paper
that
he
probably
is
also
guilty
of
a,
isn't
it?
that's
the
purpose
of
giving
the
news.
officials
don't
hand
this
out
just
to
--
from
an
indication
of
process,
do
they?
you
--
you
objected
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
my
saying
they
wanted
to
stand
in
well
at
the
--
the
press.
well
what
is
the
purpose
of
giving
--
of
feeding,
i'm
bound
to
use
that
word
again,
of
giving
publicity
due
to
the
fact
that
the
man
who
is
charged
with
one
murder
has
committed
other
murders.
what's
the
purpose
of
it?
unofficial
duty
it
is
to
prosecute
fellows.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
you
and
i
don't
answer
every
question
that's
put
to
us.
our
life
would
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
seem
harder
than
it
is
if
we
did
that,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
know
that
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
did
he
know
that
the
prosecutor
was
putting
out
a
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course,
even
if
a
fellow
(inaudible)
for
murder
once
this
side
of
the
case
put
if
it's
a
--
it's
a
mitigating
version.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
none
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
any
of
these
happen
without
the
--
without
the
authorization
and
the
willing
of
the
officials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
wonder
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there
was
a
lot
of
robbers
about
letting
it
get
out
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
appreciate
your
difficulty.
newspaper
people
constitutionally
allowed

constitutionally
allowed
to
publish

and
you're
not
up
here
defending

having
to
defend
a

that
you're
not

give
it
to

that's
the
situation
here.
justice

did
you

did
you
anywhere

of

offer
to
prove
that
the
claim
that
irvin
wanted
to
get
his
side
of
the
story
out
is
false?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
those
his
press
releases
or
the
--
or
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
chief
of
police?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
lopp,
as
the
--
the
im
of
the
courier
that
--
your
local
paper,
the
evansville
paper,
attributes
to
him
a
statement
of
his
view
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
what
--
that
what
you
have
read
may
refer
to
his
denial
of
the
truth
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
authorization
of
what
the
authorities
put
out
not
what
he
put
out.
i
listened
with
care
to
what
you've
read
and
i
don't
think
my
ears
caught
a
denial
that
he
himself
gave
some
statement
to
the
press.
is
there
such
a
specific
denial
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
press
releases
were
the
releases
of
the
chief
of
police
from
the
district
attorney
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
his
confession
to
which
he
then
made
a
reply
and
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
his
denial
of
the
truth
that
he
--
of
the
--
of
the
confession
attributed
to
him,
it
is
consistent
with
his
denial
of
the
truth
of
that
alleged
confession
to
say
that
he
didn't
gave
his
version
of
the
papers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
were
--
there
were
good
many
items
in
the
papers
on
successive
days
or
they're
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
they're
in
each
of
those,
in
each
of
those
publications
an
attribution
of
something
set
by
him
on
his
own
accounts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
that's
one
out
of
x
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
at
any
event,
it
can
cover
this
--
that
the
publications
in
which
he
didn't
participate,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
there
were
publication
that
and
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
think
mr.
givan
agreed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
that
in
which
his
name
doesn't
appear
as
the
interviewed
person.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
your
--
the
core
of
your
case
is
that
there
are
set
on
this
jury
x
number
of
jurors,
i
don't
know
how
many,
three
maybe.
but
there
were
at
least
three
men
on
that
jury,
proved
on
detail
examination,
indicated
that
they
had
a
settled
conviction
that
this
man
was
guilty
but
when
taking
in
hand
by
the
judge,
and
ask
whether
they
could,
despite
that
fact,
render
a
verdict
on
the
evidence,
they
said
they
thought
they
could.
and
your
point
is
that
that
is
--
that
adds
up
to
a
humanly
impossible
undertaking,
is
that
your
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
matter
how
this
thing
got
into
the
papers,
no
matter
how
wise
or
unwise
it
is
to
allow
papers
to
be
printed,
no
matter
who
is
responsible
for
it,
the
effect
on
the
minds
of
those
jurors
were
such
that
they
couldn't
rub
it
out.
no
matter
what
honest,
self-deluding
protestations
they
made
or
the
assurance
since
they
gave
what
they
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
