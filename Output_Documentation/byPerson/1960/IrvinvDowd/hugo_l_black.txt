different
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
appeared
this
was
april
15th.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
is
that
from
henderson,
kentucky?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
50.
i
just
look
at
51
this
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
a
defendant
--
can
a
defendant
waive
a
jury
trial
in
this
kind
of
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
waived
it,
what
would
be
your
attitude?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
had
waived
it
and
then
has
been
tried
by
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
meant
with
so
far
as
this
question
of
due
process.
it's
clear
to
me
as
i
was
listening
to
the
argument
and
looking
at
the
papers,
would
you
think
it'd
be
a
difference
if
a
judge
tried
the
case
(inaudible)
inflammatory
statements
to
put
in
your
paper
such
as
this,
it
makes
it
a
due
process
test?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
based
on
a
charge
of
a
denial
of
due
process
based
on
the
fact
that
these
facts
were
published,
these
things
were
published
in
the
paper
or
on
the
basis
that
the
record
shows
that
you
did
not
have
a
fair
and
impartial
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
quantum
of
proof
would
mean
a
difference
in
connection
with
the
charge
that
the
record
showed
a
hostility
by
judge
that
kind
of
case
and
what
would
be
if
it
was
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you'd
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
agree
however,
perhaps,
that
if
the
evidence
showed
beyond
dispute
that
all
clear
was
the
jurors
had
a
fixed
opinion
and
that
they
intended
to
exercise
it
in
one
way
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
judge
in
his
discretion
decide
to
leave
(inaudible)
wouldn't
resolve
the
constitutional
question,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
they
--
if
they
had
a
statute
that
said
they
could
try
before
people
who
had
a
fixed
opinion
and
already
decided
they're
going
to
hang
in,
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
statute
would
--
that
that
would
solve
the
due
process
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
asked
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
question
on
the
basis
that
--
of
just
thinking
as
i
heard
the
argument.
whatever
extent
we
must
be
bound
by
the
judges'
finding
has
still
the
question
before
us
to
admit
to
whether
the
whole
record
shows
that
there
was
a
trial
here
by
partial
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i'm
not
saying,
i'm
not
reaching
the
conclusion
into
that.
i'm
just
saying
if
that
--
asking
you
of
that
issue
is
not
posed
to
have
shared
on
the
record
and
the
--
and
the
briefs
and
arguments
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
make
--
it
was
my
fault.
you're
not
denying,
are
you,
that
if
--
whether
the
jury
was
partial
or
not
is
a
question
that
has
to
be
decided
on
the
record
that
the
conclusion
could
be
reached
on
circumstantially
(inaudible)
well
as
a
direct
positive
statement
by
juror.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
whether
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
the
article,
effecting
article,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
is
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
what
you've
just
read,
it's
on
the
statement
or
on
the
objection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
last
page,
you
said
the
defendant
did
not
voluntarily,
freely
on
any
circumstances
make
any
statement
or
confession
of
this
witness
or
any
other
police
officer
on
that
custody
was
at
the
said
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
ever
deny
that
you
had
given
a
confession
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
newspaper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
newspaper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
page
63.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
him
to
say
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
he
did
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
read
was
that
he
was.
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
point,
i
see
neither
one
of
you
have
referred
to
the
case
of
spies
or
thieves
against
illinois,
have
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
difference
between
the
two
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
some
of
these
have
gone
along
way
in
the
spies.
i'm
not
meaning
to
say
that
spies
covers
your
case
or
that
it
should
cover
it
but
some
of
the
jurors
went
a
long
way
with
reference
to
the
statement
that
they
were
conveyed.
and
it
was
only
by
much
finding
of
the
court
with
a
number
of
instances
that
there
could
be
urged
to
say
that
they
did
not
have
a
(inaudible)
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
expressed
it
in
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
were
accepted
on
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
as
applied.
