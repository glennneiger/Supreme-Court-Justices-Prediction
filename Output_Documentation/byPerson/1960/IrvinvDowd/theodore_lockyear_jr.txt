mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
of
this
honorable
court.
during
the
months
of
december
and
march
1954
and
1955
in
the
area
around
vanderburgh
county,
indiana
which
is
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
of
indiana
and
near
the
city
of
evansville,
there
were
approximately
six
murders
committed.
over
the
period
of
time
from
december
to
april
of
1958
--
1955,
there
was
a
widespread
of
newspaper
publicity
concerning
the
error
of
the
police
to
capture
the
person
who
had
committed
these
murders
and
also
widespread
public
feeling
as
to
people
who
were
fearful
of
their
own
lives
possibly.
on
this
--
on
april
the
8th,
1955,
the
defendant
was
arrested.
later
in
april
of
1955,
he
was
arraigned
and
in
may
of
1955,
a
change
of
venue
was
taken
from
vanderburgh
county
with
the
county
seek
an
evidence
though
to
princeton,
indiana
and
the
county
of
gibson,
indiana,
gibson
county,
indiana
which
is
approximately
27
road
miles
from
evansville.
in
october
of
1959,
prior
to
the
trial
of
the
cause,
we
found
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
and
incurred
in
the
motion,
many
of
the
newspaper
clippings,
statements
that
had
been
made
by
a
police
requested
that
the
cause
be
which
was
then
set
for
trial
on
november
the
14th,
1955,
the
venue
to
a
more
convenient
county.
from
the
original
granting
of
the
change
of
venue,
the
trial
judge
acted
without
hearing,
without
conducting
a
hearing
under
a
statute
in
the
state
of
indiana,
which
directs
the
court
upon
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
being
filed
to
send
that
cause
to
the
most
convenient
county.
no
hearing
was
had
as
to
what
was
the
most
convenient
county
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
we
were
not
counsel
at
that
time,
your
honor.
it's
my
understanding
that
that
was
done
in
chambers
and
i
actually
don't
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
the
record
doesn’t
show
and
i
don't
think
anybody
actually
knows
what
took
place.
the
judge
did
testify
at
one
time
that
he
sent
it
there
because
there
was
an
able
judge
and
because
there
was
a
good
road
up
there
and
it
was
near
to
evansville.
the
trial
was
actually
commenced
on
november
the
14th
of
19
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
it
adjoins,
it
adjoins,
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
in
our
civil
case
at
law
as
to
civil
cases,
the
law
says
that
--
and
this
is
unusual
as
i
understand
it
in
indiana.
we
make
an
affidavit
that
the
county
is
biased
and
prejudiced,
it
doesn't
even
have
to
be
an
affidavit.
now
under
the
new
supreme
court
rule
and
it
goes
to
the
adjoining
county.
the
language
of
the
criminal
change
of
venue
which
applies
to
murder
merely
says
to
the
most
convenient
county.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
to
the
most
convenient
and
that's
all
the
direction,
there
are
no
cases
which
have
interpreted
most
convenient.
no
indiana
cases
which
have
ever
interpreted
that.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes
sir.
the
jury
selection
which
comprises
the
largest
portion
of
the
record
which
is
on
file
with
this
court
and
which
was
found
in
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
to
apprise
approximately
three
and
a
half
weeks
of
a
five-week
trial.
the
defendant
was
tried,
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
sentenced
him
to
death.
we
appealed
this
cause
to
the
indiana
supreme
court
thereafter
it
sought
certiorari
to
this
court,
denied
without
prejudice
to
our
rights
to
file
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court,
in
the
federal
court.
we
then
sought,
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
northern
district
of
indiana,
issued
the
writ
conducted
a
hearing,
this
record
along
with
the
rest
of
the
transcript
was
introduced
into
record
into
evidence
by
stipulations
between
the
attorney
general
and
ourselves.
the
court
dissolved
the
writ;
appeal
was
taken
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
court
in
a
2:1
opinion
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
in
january,
a
year
ago,
this
cause
was
heard.
this
court
remanded
the
cause
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
hearing
on
the
merits.
the
directions,
they
sent
it
back
to
the
district
court,
if
the
court
felt
necessary.
the
court
of
appeals
in
november,
last
year,
on
one
day
issued
an
order
retaining
jurisdiction
on
the
next
day,
issued
an
order
affirming
the
action
of
judge
parkinson
in
dissolving
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
the
court
was
2:1
with
judge
duffy
dissenting
in
this
time.
judge
duffy
dissented
on
the
ground
that
he
thought
the
petitioner
here
has
been
denied
a
fair
trial
for
two
reasons.
first,
that
the
juror,
jury
has
constituted
was
not
an
impartial
to
jury
within
the
meaning
of
fourteenth
amendment
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
secondly,
because
of
the
actions
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
participating
as
a
interrogator
of
the
jury
in
voir
dire,
interrogating
witnesses
during
the
trial,
thereafter
testifying
as
a
witness,
and
then
subsequently
being
permitted
in
to
comment
upon
his
own
testimony,
in
the
oral
argument
to
the
jury.
the
court
of
appeals
heard
no
additional
argument,
after
this
court
sent
it
back.
in
the
meantime,
judge
flanagan
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
original
panel
of
three
that
heard
this
man
who
died,
he
was
replaced
by
judge
cassell
on
the
court
and
also
on
this
particular
panel.
judge
cassell
never
heard
the
argument
on
this
case.
he
merely
rendered
his
decision
along
with
judge
schnackenberg
from
the
evidence
as
presented
in
the
briefs.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
we
didn't
have
time.
it
was
--
as
i
say,
the
court
on
one
day
said,
"we're
taking
jurisdiction
and
the
next
day
rendered
their
decision."
now
we
found
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
asked
for
oral
argument,
and
that
was
denied.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes
sir
and
they
--
from
may,
when
this
court
rendered
its
decision
until
november,
there
was
nothing
done
and
then
one
day
they
rendered
a
decision
that
they
had
retained
–
decided
to
retain
jurisdiction
and
the
next
day
they
rendered
an
opinion
affirming
2:1.
that
is
judge
parkinson's
action.
but
they
heard
no
additional
argument
and
as
i
say
we
found
petition
for
rehearing
and
asked
for
oral
argument
and
that
was
denied.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
no
additional
briefs
were
filed.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
found
on
our
petition
for
rehearing
briefs
with
that.

page
55.
yes,
sir.
court
will
recall
that
in
the
previous
argument
in
this
case
in
1959,
we
presented
to
the
court
the
fact
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
had
interrogated
the
jurors
and
participated
questioning
witnesses,
had
testified
as
a
witness
himself
and
that
he
had
been
permitted
to
come
in
upon
his
own
testimony
in
the
argument
to
the
jury.
now
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
he
said,
"i
told
you
myself
of
what
he
told
to
me."
that
--
that
is
a
part
of
the
record.
he
has
the
same,
mr.
weaver,
who
in
--
on
page

of
the
transcript,
his
picture
is
shown
here
along
with

said
enough
evidence
had
been
obtained
to
file
a
murder
charge
of
the

then
a
grand
jury
would
be
called
and
added
the

are

then
at

the

for

then
purported

in
the
statement
referred
to

apparently
referred
to
with
the
picture
with
mr.

and
mr.

because
these
quotes
are
taken
from
chief
dan
hudson
stating
what
supposedly
was
told
to
him

mr.
theodore
lockyear,

yes,
sir.
now,
this
--
in
this
page,
it
become
loose
from
the
transfer
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
--
but
it's
actually
page
79.
then
on
--
in
the
press,
that
was
the
kerr
in
the
press
of
the
15th,
the
day
after
the

of
mr.

nor

we
ask
death
to

this
is
mr.

the

attorney.
and
he
tells

said
today,
he

leslie

he
won't
be
a
party
to
any
deal
for
less
punishment
as
the
caption
of
that
page.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
if
this
prosecutor
does
this,
releases
this
information
and
creates
the
very
condition
which
later
becomes
much
more
important
when
you
try
to
select
a
jury
in
this
case,
i
--
i
don't
think
it's
any
of
the
paper's
business
whether
he
asked
for
the
death
penalty
or
doesn't
ask
for
the
death
penalty.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
it's
all
done
in
one
trial,
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
jury
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
no,
they
fixed
the
penalty.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
they
fixed
the
penalty.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
life
or
death.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
they
have
two
choices
or
not
guilty.
are
they
confining
guilty
of
lesser
inclusion
of
offense
in
this
particular
case,
they
couldn't,
under
the
indictment.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
no,
sir.
life
or
death.
now,
we
have
also
included
in
the
--
our
brief,
the
radio
statement
made
by
mr.
weaver
in
connection
with
the
radio
announcer
ralph
smith.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
that's
what
the
paper
says.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
that's
what
the
paper
says.
there's
absolutely
no
record
in
this
case
of
any
time
that
that
was
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
there
is
no
evidence,
absolutely
no
evidence
that
that
was
done
from
newspaper
or
anybody
else.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
if
he
had
created
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
--
if
he
had
created
the
condition,
i
don't
see
where
he
could
complain.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
i
think
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
if
we're
to
try
this
case
on
what
the
newspaper
said.
we're
--
we're
not
going
to
take
as
true
the
things
that
are
set
out
in
this
paper.
that
would
certainly
be
hearsay.
what
those
papers
show
is
a
condition
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
as
the
result
of
--
of
the
reports
that
were
given
by
the
prosecutor
and
by
the
chief.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
well,
what
do
we
know
--
what
does
authorize
means,
what
was
done
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
we
know
about.
this
was
all
before
we
were
in
the
case.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
never
denied
by
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
we
take
the
truth
--
if
we
take
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
by
the
--
by
the
same
token
we
can't
take
as
true
the
fact
that
he
has
confessed
by
virtue
of
this
newspaper
nor
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
we
put
the
newspaper
in
as
--
as
exhibits.
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
we're
chargeable
with
the
truth
of
any
facts
set
in
that
newspaper.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
but
we
can't
cut
that
part
out
of
the
paper.
we
have
to
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
--
include
the
whole
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
that's
right.
we
can't
cut
it
out
nor
can
we
take
as
true
the
facts
--
the
paper
says
he
confessed.
now,
do
we
take
that
as
true
too?
does
this
court
take
as
a
fact
that
this
man
has
confessed
to
seek
murder
by
virtue
of
what
this
paper
says?
can
we
take
the
result
of
what
they
say
as
to
other
--
other
crimes?
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
then
we
would
begin
into
a
comfort
with
the
newspaper
and
the
collateral
issues
which
is
true
and
which
isn't
true.
the
important
thing
is
what
evidence
is
to
be
presented
in
the
trial
of
this
man.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
a
different
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
nor
can
we
go
to
the
opposite
presumption
that
everything
in
newspaper
is
true.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
here
is
the
morning
paper
of
april
the
14th,
1955,
six
murders
solved.
there
is
nothing
in
that
paper
that
says
that
he
authorized
the
release
of
all
that
information.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
same
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
that's
evansville
courier,
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
no,
this
--
this
is
the
courier
of
the
next
day.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
different
issue.
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
that
much,
a
full
page
for
approximately
a
week.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
day
after
day.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
and
it
--
and
it's
still
every
time
that
there's
something
done
in
court,
it
makes
a
front
page
as
he
is
the
confessed
killer
of
six
persons.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
well,

the

recall
that
mr.

again
appeared
in

it's

at

upon

of
mr.

he
offered
to
let
mr.

answer
any
questions
that
might
--
this
court
might
have.
and
we
think
that
this
violates
canon
19,
the
two
judges
in
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
concede
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
canons
of
ethics.
counsel
in
his

says
that
this
conduct
on
the
part
of
mr.

of
paul
weaver,
that's
page
25
of
his
brief,
is
contrary
to
canon

and
the
canon
for

ethics.
there
is
no
showing
that
in
anyway
violates

right
to

don't
have

that
can
say
that
this
statement
violated

--
to
this
extent.
we
don't
have
the
answers
to
that
question
but
we
think
that
that
conduct
is
so
offensive.
and
the
fact
that
a
man
who
was
a
witness
to
this
trial
permit
to
argue
and
then
would
come
before
this
court
also
prepared

in

if
requested
to

so
violative

now,

did
you

mr.

i'll

yes,

and
we
asked
that
that
be

that
his

be

and
the

refused
to
let
us
prepare
the

of

mr.

it

mr.

mr.
theodore

that's
right.
and
the
court
certified
then
as
a
bill
of
exception
in
that
record.
it
was
introduced
and
that
was
done
in
the
presence
of
mr.
weaver
and
done
in
the
presence
of
mr.
sandusky
(ph)
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
that
it
was
a
serious
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
attorney.
it's
found
on
page
50
--
51
of
the
transcript,
a
form
where
the
ethics
of
mr.
weaver's
conduct
is
directly
brought
and
issued
by
the
state
of
indiana.
it
is
apparent
that
a
charge
of
unethical
conduct
on
the
foregoing
facts
would
be
serious.
however
in
this
case,
we
cannot
adjudicate
a
question
of
that.
certainly,
the
testimony
he
gave
was
relevant
to
the
case
on
trial
and
he
was
a
competent
witness.
as
a
factual
matter,
the
defense
offered
near
evidence
to
contradict
weaver's
statement
then
defense
went
to
see
mr.
weaver.
therefore,
in
view
of
all
these
circumstance,
it
is
entirely
a
manner
of
surmise
whether
weaver's
conduct
had
a
harmful
effect
upon
the
defendant
in
the
minds
of
the
jury.
it's
more
reasonable
to
conclude
that
such
conduct
would
ran

page
50
and
51.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
there's
more
reason
to
conclude
that
the
jurors
would
react
against
the
statement
in
view
of
such
conduct
by
his
legal
representative.
however,
that
maybe
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
this
conduct
was
error
which
did
not
have
such
a
substantial
effect
upon
the
outcome
as
to
strip
the
trial
of
due
process.
and
judge
duffy,
on
page
53,
in
dissenting,
said
another
reason
for
the
failure
of
due
process
in
the
instant
case
is
the
one
that
--
is
that
one
of
the
two
state
prosecuting
attorneys
who
tried
the
case
also
acted
as
a
witness
on
the
trial.
the
majority
opinion
while
conceding
this
was
error
seem
to
brush
it
aside
saying,
"however
in
this
case,
we
cannot
adjudicate
a
question
of
ethics."
prosecutor
weaver
participating,
examining
prospect
of
jurors
interposed
objection
to
testimony
otherwise,
actively
participating
in
the
trial.
he
then
took
the
stand
as
a
witness
and
testified
concerning
the
confession
made
to
him
or
objection
he
made
opposing
argument
to
the
jury
commenting
on
the
evidence
including
his
own
testimony.
such
conduct
was
in
violation
of
canon
19
of
canon
for
professional
ethics.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
well,
subject
to
either
objection,
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
there
were
relevant
objections
made
to
the
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
not
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
a
prosecutor.
is
that
what's
the
court's
question?
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
there
is
that
question
also
presented
and
that
we
objected
to
his
testimony
as
a
--
as
well
as
the
witness
hudson
on
the
ground
that
this
man
had
been
held
from
august
--
from
april
the
8th,
1955
up
until
this
purported
confession
was
made
on
the
14th
and
then
a
purported
confession
made
on
the
15th
and
then
it
was
a
16th
before
he
was
ever
arraigned.
and
we
made
the
objection
as
to
the
admissibility
of
that
confession
under
the
watts
case.
and
the
court,
we
say,
denied
us
a
hearing
on
that
question.
they
say
otherwise
but
that
was
also
an
objection
to
the
admissibility
of
that
testimony
by
the
witness
whether
it
was
the
prosecutor
or
chief
detective
hudson.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
well,
it's
--
it's
not
clear
what
he
was
held
on.
if
we
believe
the
newspaper,
he
was
held
on
pro-violator.
if
we
believe
one
of
the
witnesses,
he
was
on
bad
check
charge.
if
we
believe
in
other
witness,
he
was
on
burglary.
the
question
was
asked,
what
was
he
arrested
for?
and
there
were
several
different
answers
given
why
he
was
held
for
but
he
was
never
taking
before
a
court
or
magistrate.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
he
was
asked
about
the
murders
after
he
had
been
arrested.
now,
the
question
under
--
was
whether
or
not
he
was
actually
arrested
for
those
murders,
whether
he
was
arrested
for
a
check
charge,
which
the
evidence
was
clear
that
they
did
not
even
know
about
until
after
he
had
been
arrested.
a
man
read
in
a
paper
where
he
had
been
arrested
and
says,
"i've
got
to
check
from
you.
and
i
--
i
went
down
to
the
police
station
and
showed
them
and
talked
to
them
about
it."
now,
there's
odd
evidence
that
says
the
arrest.
now,
whether
--
the
--
the
record
is
not
clear
on
what
he
was
actually
arrested
and
held
for.
there's
a
conflict
as
to
that.
so
then
i
can't
say
that
it's
all
one
way
or
the
other.
i
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
court
can
direct
and
to
be
tried
by
jury
anyway
or
the
prosecutor.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
suppose
he
had
waived
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
i
believe
we
would
move
for
a
change
of
venue
from
the
trial,
that's
first.
secondly,
the
state
in
occasion
and
recently
on
appeal
to
the
indiana
supreme
court,
it
was
held
that
state
of
indiana
has
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
and
so
that
we
do
not
know
when
the
--
when
the
state
would
request
a
trial
(inaudible).
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
the
--
none
as
to
the
due
process
test
where
we
have
an
elected
judge.
judge
is
elected
every
six
years
by
the
people,
the
question
as
to
what
--
whether
or
not
he
was
able.
i
think
we
have
to
prove
actual
bias
on
the
part
of
--
of
the
judge
or
bias
from
the
community
that
--
that
would
affect
his
decision.
i
think
certainly,
it's
--
it's
just
as
equally
conceivable
that
the
judge
would
be
biased
under
evidence
such
as
at
--
what
--
by
the
prospect
of
juror
hensley
as
any
other
person.
he
had
the
opinion
that
he
was
guilty.
there
were
300
--
over
269
jurors
who
said
that
he
was
guilty.
and
they
were
the
opinion
--
had
fixed
the
opinion
as
to
the
case.
certainly,
it's
conceivable
that
that
would
have
permeated
the
judge
just
as
well
as
it
would
to
the
jury,
this
bias
and
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
it
start
out
with
100
and
then
there
were
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
431
were
actually
examined.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
on

dire.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
431.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
269
were
excused
by
the
court
for
fixed
opinions.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
on
that
subject.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
they
had
a
fixed
opinion.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
well
--
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
juror
hensley,
they
were
all
qualified
with
the
judge.
in
other
words,
they
were
asked
the
question,
"can
you
set
this
opinion
aside?"
and
they
said,
"yes.
i
can
be
fair."
but
on
page
21,
hensley
was
asked
so
in
this
--
so
in
this
particular
case.
"you
could
not
enter
in
this
manner
and
give
the
defendant
benefit
of
doubt
that
he
is
innocent."
"that's
right."
"and
on
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
rather
impractical
for
you
to
run
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
based
solely
upon
the
evidence."
"that's
right,"
over
on
page
31
--
30
and
31.
"when
you
came
in
here
as
a
jury,
you
still
continue
to
have
that
opinion."
"yes,
that's
right."
"and
whether
or
not,
this
opinion
that
you've
formed
and
expressed
as
the
defendant
was
that
he
was
guilty
of
this
particular
crime
charged."
"just
in
my
own
mind,
that's
right."
"in
that
opinion
you
also
form
an
expressed
opinion
that
the
defendant
confessed
to
this
particular
crime."
"well,
i
don't
know
if
i
said
that
or
not
but
i
understand
from
the
papers
that
he
did."
"you
have
the
opinion
that
he
did
confess
to
the
crimes."
"that's
right,"
and
this
is
on
page
31
of
our
brief."
you
have
the
opinion
that
he
confessed
to
other
crimes."
"i
believe
so."
"and
you
have
an
opinion
that
the
defendant
shot,
killed
and
murdered
kerr,
isn't
that
right?"
"yes,
sir,
that's
right."
"and
you
have
formed
the
opinion
that
the
defendant
shot,
killed
and
murdered
kerr
while
the
defendant
was
perpetuating
a
robbery."
"have
you
formed
any
opinion
as
to
fixing
the
penalty?"
"i
don't
know
if
i
did.
"they
just
formed
that
as
one
law."
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
on
the
basis
that

the
record
shows
that
he
did
not
have
a

and

--
and
they
answered,
yes.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
if
he
let
the
juror
decide
whether
he's
qualified
or
not,
they
came
within
that
answer
--
within
that
statute.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
lockyear,
jr.
and
we
--
we
don't
think
that
he
could
soundly
--
he
exercised
discretion.
we
don't
think
it
was
soundly
good
in
--
in
view
of
all
the
other
testimony
of
this
prospective
juror,
which
is
completely
contrary
to
anything
else,
that
--
that
he
says.
we'd
like
to
reserve
a
little
time.
