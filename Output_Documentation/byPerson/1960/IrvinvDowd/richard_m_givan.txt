mr.
richard
m.
givan
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
clear
up
a
question
or
two
here
that
has
been
raised
by
mr.
lockyear's
argument.
first
of
all,
his
contention
here
that
the
things
are
in
somewhat
a
state
of
confusion
in
the
record
as
to
what
irvin
was
arrested
for
and
how
he
was
held
in
the
early
part
of
his
incarceration.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
the
court
to
this
trial
transcript
that
you
have
before
you
in
this
case
at
volume
2
of
that
transcript,
if
the
court
recall
it
it's
in
six
volumes
and
in
volume
2,
at
page
1180,
you
will
find
there
a
testimony
by
evansville
detective
cornett
or
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
state
police
detective
cornett
to
the
express
effect
and
it
is
not
contradicted
that
he
approached
leslie
irvin
on
april
the
11th
--
april
the
8th
at
11
a.m.
and
that
he
questioned
irvin
at
that
time
concerning
the
passing
of
some
bad
checks.
and
that
at
that
time
irvin
admitted
to
him
that
he
had
done
such
a
thing
and
that
upon
his
admission,
he
took
irvin
into
custody
as
a
parole
violator.
irvin
was
at
that
time
on
parole
from
the
indiana
state
prison.
and
it
was
while
irvin
was
being
held
pursuant
to
this
arrest
as
a
parole
violator
that
he
was
then
examined
and
questioned
concerning
the
murder
for
which
he
was
later
tried.
i
just
wanted
to
clear
up
that
point.
i
--
i
think
that
the
court
should
know
that
it
is
the
state's
position
that
irvin
was
under
lawful
arrest
on
an
entirely
separate
matter
at
the
time
of
his
holding
and
that
therefore,
he
does
not
come
under
the
rule
that
has
been
set
out
by
this
court
previously.
i
think
we
might
--
i
think
it's
been
referred
to
as
the
mcnabb
rule
of
the
admissibility
of
confessions
in
--
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
carrington,
the
court
expressly
stated
that
a
person
who
was
being
lawfully
held
in
the
custody
of
another
would
not
be
subject
to
the
mcnabb
rule
and
that
confession
that
he
gave
under
such
incarceration
would
be
admissible.
now,
mr.
justice
black,
i
believe,
asked
the
question
as
to
whether
the
same
question
would
be
presented
here
if
this
was
a
trial
by
a
--
the
court
rather
than
by
the
jury.
and
it
is
the
state's
position
that
we
are
in
the
same
set
of
circumstances,
mr.
justice
black,
that
we
take
the
position
that
this
jury
properly
qualified
under
the
indiana
statute
and
therefore,
having
properly
qualified
under
the
indiana
statute,
we
are
faced
with
this
--
precisely
the
same
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
newspaper
publicity
rendered
the
situation
such
that
the
defendant
could
not
have
a
fair
trial.
now,
if
the
court
would
find
that
the
newspaper
publicity
was
of
such
a
nature
that
the
defendant
could
not
have
a
fair
trial,
under
the
circumstances,
i
think,
it
would
be
of
a
little
moment
whether
or
not
it
was
the
trial
judge
who
was
influenced
by
those
newspaper
reports
or
whether
it
was
a
juror
who
was
influenced
by
the
reports
if
it
was
demonstrated
by
the
petitioner
that
such
influence
did
in
fact
exist.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
don't
know
as
to
the
quantum
of
proof,
your
honor.
the
--
as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned
and
under
the
indiana
statute,
the
proof
is
left
to
the
--
to
the
decision
of
the
trial
court.
he
--
under
the
terms,
the
very
terms
of
the
statute,
the
judge
makes
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
publicity
and
the
information
which
the
prospecting
juror
has
acquired.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it's
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
would
not,
your
honor.
in
such
a
case,
i
would
be
the
first
to
say
that
the
judge
would
--
would
have
abused
his
discretion
and
would
not
have
followed
the
statute
and
that
the
jurors
did
not
qualify
under
the
statute
if
they
expressed
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
a
fixed
opinion
that
they
require.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
it
certainly
would
not
and
i
would
say
that
the
statute
of
that
nature
would
not
afford
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
such
a
statute
existed.
however,
we
present
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
the
nature
of
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
which
we
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
i
think
we
would
have
to
say
that
--
i
don't
know
that
we
can
say
the
whole
trial
because
we
don't
know
how
partial
the
jury
was.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
not
precisely,
your
honor.
i
think
this.
we
can't
look
to
the
trial
to
see
whether
the
jury
was
in
fact
biased
or
prejudice.
we
have
no
action
from
--
by
the
jury,
any
comments
for
any
members
of
the
jury
from
which
we
could
draw
any
conclusions
after
the
clause
of
the
voir
dire
examination
until
we
come
to
the
verdict
itself.
and
of
course,
i
think
we
must
immediately
say
that
the
--
the
existence
of
a
guilty
verdict
doesn't
impute
any
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
think
it
--
whole
--
the
whole
voir
dire
examination
has
to
be
taken
in
its
entirety.
we
cannot
--
the
petitioner
here
cannot
take
a
portion
of
the
voir
dire
examination
nor
can
the
state
take
a
portion
of
the
voir
dire
examination.
the
entire
voir
dire
examination
has
to
be
examined
and
weighed
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
judge
in
fact
did
qualify
these
jurors
and
whether
the
prosecution
and
in
fact
in
aiding
the
court
in
this
matter
did
in
fact
qualify
these
jurors
under
the
expressed
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
i
have.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
had
to
hesitate
to
place
and
number
on
it
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
would
say
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
considerable
times
and
without
just
going
into
expressed
number
because
it
wasn't
only
the
evansville
courier
but
it
was
other
newspapers
including
indianapolis
newspapers
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
evansville
courier
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
can
only
say
that
this
happened
several
times,
your
honor,
that
--
and
i
--
i
hastened
to
say
that
when
we
talked
about
the
newspaper
men
seeing
things
that
were
not
actually
introduced
in
the
evidence,
i
think
it's
impossible
to
draw
from
the
newspaper
accounts
whether
these
matters
were
actually
transmitted
to
the
newspaper
men
by
the
sheriff
or
by
paul
weaver
or
whether
these
working
in
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
conclusions
that
they
drew
themselves.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
would
say
that
the
quotations
from
officials
were
frequent
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
that
they
--
they
did
this
quite
often
and
as
you
state
yourself,
the
examination
of
the
record
would
be
the
best
example
of
that
but
in
any
event,
we
know
this,
that
on
frequent
occasions,
the
newspapers
purported
to
"neither
paul
weaver
or
the
sheriff
as
to
what
leslie
irvin
had
told
them
as
to
his
particular
activities".
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
no
different
than
any
criminal
prosecution
that
we
ever
have
on
an
infamous
crime
of
this
order,
a
crime
that
gains
a
great
deal
of
notoriety
and
the
court
can
call
on
its
own
knowledge
of
the
lindbergh
kidnapping,
bruno
richard
hauptmann
and
the
--
the
statements
that
were
attributed
to
him.
of
course,
any
criminal
is
in
the
custody
of
the
custodial
officer
and
it
is
not
the
custom,
of
course,
to
allow
them
to
hold
press
conferences
of
--
on
their
own
and
they
--
the
matters
which
they
state
to
the
custodial
officers
if
they
get
in
the
newspaper
at
all
come
through
the
custodial
officer
in
some
manner.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
these
newspaper
articles
that
we
do
have
in
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
record
here
were
submitted
by
the
petitioner
himself
in
support
of
his
applications
for
continuance
i
think.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
oh,
it
was
open,
yes.
i
should
take
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
take
it
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no.
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
they
did
it
all,
your
honor.
in
fact
to
the
matter
is
i
have
no
question
but
what
the
state
officers
did
in
fact
answer
questions
which
were
presented
to
them
by
the
newspaper
authorities.
they
naturally
congregated
it
to
jail
when
the
news
was
out
that
these
--
that
these
crimes
--
i
might
say
this
your
honor,
that
the
crimes
had
received
extreme
and
extensive
publicity
prior
to
the
arrest
of
irvin.
this
--
this
was
a
great
news
story
in
this
area
before
they
knew
who
did
it.
and
there
were
severe
criticism
of
the
police
officers
because
they
hadn't
apprehended
anybody
yet.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
that
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
think
this,
your
honor,
that
we
have
had
no
--
no
case
yet
in
american
jurisprudence
or
any
other
jurisdiction
that
i
know
of
where
the
custodial
authorities
are
absolutely
bound
to
silence.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it's
--
it
is,
sir,
and
i
--
i
submit
to
you
that
an
examination
of
this
entire
record
will
show
an
absence
of
an
actual
feeding
of
stuff
to
the
press
as
--
as
you
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
wouldn't
say
that.
now,
if
we
say
that
the
matter
of
his
insanity,
for
instance,
whether
--
that
he
was
sane
or
insane.
now,
obviously,
the
newspapers
got
hold
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
examination
of
irvin
and
that
the
doctor
said
that
he
was
sane
and
that
he
must
stand
trial.
now,
of
course,
you
don't
put
evidence
of
that
into
the
trial
but
it
goes
without
that
saying
that
he
is
standing
trial
and
he
is
sane
or
he
wouldn't
be
standing
trial.
it's
--
it's
very
difficult
to
--
to
thrash
out
these
things
in
separate
one
from
the
other
and
say
what
the
newspapers
may
publish
or
what
the
prosecutor
or
what
the
police
chief
or
whoever
it
maybe
may
say
concerning
the
incarceration
concerning
the
crime
itself.
and
i
think
it's
not
a
proper
standard
to
say
that
everything
that
is
released
must
be
something
that
is
admissible
in
evidence.
now,
i
think
everything
that
would
tend
to
influence
a
jury
as
to
his
guilt
or
innocence
such
as
how
the
crime
was
committed,
the
content
of
the
confession,
all
of
those
things,
of
course,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
were
introduced
in
evidence
in
the
irvin
trial.
now
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
there
were.
the
--
the
confession
that
irvin
made
including
the
other
crimes
and
that
was
part
of
the
newspaper
publicity
that
he
was
to
confess
slayer
as
to
these
other
crimes.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
that's
--
that's
what
the
newspaper
say.
i
might
say
to
uphold
the
newspaper
statement
to
that
effect,
you
will
find
in
the
record
the
testimony
of
paul
weaver
himself
and
incidentally,
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
citation
in
volume
3,
again,
of
this
trial
transcript
that
you
have
here.
in
volume
3,
at
page
1834
to
1846,
i
have
that
in
my
brief
as
a
citation
to
a
portion
of
paul
weaver's
testimony
and
i
submit
that
his
testimony
is
found
in
the
--
starting
immediately
before
that
and
ending
immediately
after
those
pages
and
these
--
within
those
pages
in
volume
3,
1834
and
1846,
you
will
find
the
testimony
of
paul
weaver
and
in
that
testimony,
you
will
find
that
the
--
according
to
paul
weaver,
and
i'm
quoting
him
expressly
because
the
question
was
asked
is
what
he
did
testify
to,
and
i
answered
the
two
things
at
once.
that
--
paul
weaver
said
that
leslie
irvin
specifically
called
for
him
to
come
to
his
cell
in
the
jail
and
asked
that
he
be
permitted
to
talk
to
paul
weaver.
he
did
talk
to
paul
weaver,
told
him
some
of
the
manner
in
which
this
thing
occurred
and
he
asked
him
if
he
could
be
tried
in
indiana
or
would
he
be
turned
back
to
kentucky.
and
weaver
said,
"well,
we
don't
have
enough
yet
to
try
you
hearing."
leslie
irvin
says,
"what
more
do
you
need?"
and
he
said,
"we
need
the
gun
that
you
committed
these
crimes
with."
and
leslie
irvin
said,
"that's
easy.
i
know
where
i
put
it."
and
he
took
them
out
and
after
a
couple
of
day
search,
they
found
the
gun
in
the
stream
where
leslie
irvin
indicated
it
would
be.
now,
this
testimony
must
hasten
on
and
say
that
this
was
not
paul
weaver's
testimony
alone
but
also
the
testimony
of
the
police
officers
involved
in
the
investigation
including
--
i
mean
especially
including
detective
hudson
who
had
talked
to
irvin,
who
had
gone
to
obtain
paul
weaver
to
comment,
irvin's
be
--
request
and
who
had
been
present
when
irvin
indicated
where
the
gun
would
be
found
and
then
testified
concerning
the
finding
of
the
gun
and
the
identification
of
the
gun.
now,
all
of
these
goes
to
demonstrate,
i
think,
in
addition
of
paul
weaver's
testimony
was
merely
cumulative
although
he
did
testify
to
these
things
as
a
prosecutor.
his
testimony
was
cumulative,
he
did
not
testify
to
a
single
thing
that
was
not
testified
too
by
others
in
the
trial
and
that
nothing
was
proven
by
paul
weaver's
testimony
that
was
not
independently
proven.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
certainly
will
comment
on
that
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
my
understanding
of
this,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
comes
out
in
these
newspaper
articles
quite
clearly
that
not
only
in
paul
weaver's
testimony
and
detective
hudson's
testimony
but
in
the
very
newspaper
articles
themselves
the
comments
by
the
reporters
that
leslie
irvin
was
quite
anxious
at
one
time
to
be
tried
for
this
crime
in
indiana
and
not
to
be
returned
to
kentucky
where
there
was
a
great
deal
of
feeling,
at
least
he
felt
a
great
deal
of
feeling
against
him.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
i
don't
think
it's
customary
for
them
to
hold
press
releases
as
i've
indicated
before
but
at
the
same
time,
it
is
nothing
unusual,
if
i
might
digress
this
lightly,
there's
nothing
unusual
for
a
criminal
of
leslie
irvin's
type.
i
don't
think
to
--
to
enjoy
his
publicity
to
a
certain
extent
than
to
give
press
releases.
this
is
something
that
we
cope
with
--
try
to
cope
with
all
the
time.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
i
hope
they
didn't
go
that
far,
your
honor,
i
will
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
he
was
quite
well
treated.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
indication
here
that
the
sheriff
was
not
present
when
these
newspaper
men
talked
to
him.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
but
what
the
--
the
sheriff
was
there
at
the
time
or
some
authorized
jailer
was
there
and
if
leslie
irvin
talked
to
these
men
that
it
was
done
so
in
his
presence.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
he
would,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
was
particularly
standing
in
well
with
anybody
except
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
leslie
irvin
--
if
leslie
irvin
wanted
to
talk
to
a
--
a
newspaper
reporter,
we
have
sheriffs
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
it
was.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
had
been
involved
in
few
instances
that
sort
myself.
i
know
that
that
--
those
things
happen.
the
police
officers
will
fit,
let's
say
cooperative
with
newspapers,
there's
no
question.
we
have
a
--
a
problem
with
--
with
newspaper
men,
if
i
may
say
so
[laughs].
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
each
official
finds
his
own
way
to
cope
with
the
particular
newspapermen
and
i
--
and
not
prone
to
criticize
them
--
the
particular
officer
for
coping
with
the
newspaper
in
the
manner
in
which
he
sees
fit
as
long
as
it
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
there's
no
question.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
there
--
there's
no
question
about
that
and
i
think
we
might
go
on
--
on
and
say
the
--
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
we
have
cited
that
were
news
--
the
trial
court's
have
been
forbidden,
i
might
say,
to
enforce
their
(inaudible)
by
contempt
citation
against
newspapers.
and
the
--
the
interpretation
of
freedom
of
the
press
that
has
been
given
by
this
court
gives
the
newspapers
pretty
much
carte
blanche
as
far
as
their
activities
are
concerned
and
so
we
--
we
accept
that
law
but
i'm
not
being
critical
with
this
court
in
any
fashion,
i'm
just
--
i'm
stating
a
fact
and
we
must
accept
that
fact
and
work
with
it.
and
so
we
--
we
go
from
there
as
to
see
how
we
cope
with
this
problem
that
we
have
with
the
newspapers.
i
would
like
to
answer
one
question
here
of
mr.
justice
whittaker
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
had
asked
during
mr.
lockyear's
statement
here
that
if
any
juror
failed
to
qualify
under
the
indiana
statute
and
my
answer
to
that,
sir,
is
no.
no
juror
failed
to
qualify
under
the
indiana
statute.we
have
set
out
what
we
feel
to
be
pertinent
excerpts
from
the
transcript
in
our
brief
wherein
the
questions
asked
of
the
various
jurors
who
in
fact
served
on
this
jury,
we
feel
clearly
show
that
these
jurors
did
qualify
expressly
under
the
statute.
now,
i
think
that
we
have
here,
gentlemen,
a
question
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
this
is
an
old
statute,
your
honor.
actually,
we
had
some
--
a
statute
prior
to
our
1905
code.
in
1905,
indiana
recodified
is
the
criminal
law
in
that
state.
prior
to
that
time,
we
had
a
statute
very
similar
to
this
and
some
of
the
cases
which
we
have
cited
to
the
court,
indiana
cases,
are
discussing
the
old
statute.
but
this
statute,
as
it
now
exists,
in
its
present
language
was
a
part
of
the
criminal
code
in
the
recodification
in
1905.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
not
by
any
means,
your
honor.
in
fact,
this
court,
before
1900,
used
almost
exactly
the
same
language
as
our
statute
uses
and
i
have
cited
that
case
to
the
court
in
the
reynolds
case,
reynolds
versus
united
states,
cited
in
our
brief,
page
16
--
quoted
page
16
and
cited
page
17,
holds
that
express
thing.
i
think
it's
a
statute
that
is
absolutely
essentially.
so
we
are
faced
with
this
simple
situation.
we
know
from
the
cases
handed
down
by
this
court
where
we
stand
so
far
as
newspaper
publicity
is
concerned.
we
know
that
we
priced
highly
the
freedom
of
the
press
and
we
permit
them
under
their
constitutional
right
to
say
many
things.
and
we
do
not
quarrel
with
their
right
to
publish
these
various
news
happenings.
now,
we
must
say
how
are
we
going
to
try
a
man
who
is
accused
of
a
crime
in
a
jurisdiction
where
this
publicity
is
permitted.
now,
how
they
acquire
the
publicity,
i
think,
does
figure
into
the
picture.we
have
some
cases.
but
i
would
urge
the
court
to
read
those
cases
pretty,
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner
here
wherein
it
was
held
that
the
manner
of
releasing
the
news
and
so
forth
was
a
--
amounted
to
a
denial
of
due
process
in
the
trial
court.
but
i
submit
that
each
of
those
--
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
share
for
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
someone
in
authority
gave
news
releases
as
to
purported
facts
that
actually
pointed
to
the
--
directly
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
man
but
which
facts
were
never
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
trial.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
the
--
the
quotes
--
now,
i
can't
say
that
these
were
exact
quotes
from
the
officials.
the
--
the
statements
made
in
irvin's
confession
that
were
released
to
the
newspapers
either
by
irvin
himself
or
by
the
custodial
authorities
actually
did
include
these
other
crimes.
but
as
to
the
crime
itself,
what
i'm
getting
at,
is
the
crime
itself
with
the
murder
of
whitney
wesley
kerr.
there
was
not
one
single
bit
of
publicity
concerning
that
crime
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
which
was
not
proven
at
the
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
they
--
they
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
let
me
say
this,
your
honor,
i
think
in
--
and
especially
so
in
this
case,
the
indication
is
at
least
that
these
releases
were
in
response
to
specific
questions
asked
by
the
newspaper
men.
it
wasn't
a
question
of
feeding
the
press
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
true.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
but
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
that's
certainly
so.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no.
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
my
--
my
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
as
far
as
i
know
he
did.
in
fact,
i
think
the
indication
is
clearly
in
the
record
that
he
hoped
the
prosecutor
would
put
out
the
statement.
he
seemed
to
be
more
concern
with
whether
the
statement
was
the
way
he
wanted
it
to
be
than
he
did
whether
it
was
being
put
out.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
but
in
--
in
any
event,
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
well,
that's
our
position,
your
honor
that
he
--
he
had
seen
fit
to
engage
in
this
activity
and
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
no,
sir.
i
would
not.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
sir
mr.
richard
m.
givan
yes,
he
did.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
pretty
broad
question,
your
honor.
a
lot
of
things
can
happen
in
--
in
a
jail
and
a
lot
--
a
lot
of
information
gets
out.
witness
at
chessman
case
where
he
wrote
an
entire
book
and
it
--
it
got
outside
the
prison.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
right
and
i
think
they
even
fired
somebody
for
letting
that
happen.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
but
whether
we
can
say
that
that
was
an
act
of
an
official
acting
in
his
official
capacity
which
would
bind
the
state
is
a
different
story.
and
i
couldn't
make
the
broad
statement
that
this
couldn't
happen
unless
an
official
authorized
it.
i
think
many
newspaper
men
are
quite
resourceful
as
your
honor
well
knows
i'm
sure,
and
they
will
get
the
story
one
way
or
another,
i
can't
say
that
here
--
in
every
instance.
and
the
--
in
fact
in
this
particular
case,
that
every
instance
of
news
release
was
done
through
the
cooperation
of
the
sheriff
and
the
press
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
--
that's
right.
right.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
--
just
a
few
remarks
to
paul
weaver's
testimony
and
the
state's
position
there.
the
state
takes
the
position
as
i've
previously
stated
that
paul
weaver's
testimony
was
merely
cumulative.
it
added
nothing
to
the
evidence
that
was
already
in
as
far
as
his
comments
on
the
final
argument.
there
is
no
verbatim
transcript
of
that
argument
as
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
there
is
only
a
bystander's
bill
of
exceptions
which
purports
to
say
what
paul
weaver
did
and
the
most
that
we
can
find
in
that
bystander's
bill
of
exceptions
is
the
statement
that
paul
weaver
made
that
you
heard
me
testify,
you
heard
yourself
what
i
testified
to
you,
words
to
that
effect.
there
is
no
statement
in
there
that
he
reviewed
each
individual
fact
and
retestified
or
that
he
added
anything
to
what
he
had
previously
said.
nothing
of
that
sort
appears
in
this
bystander's
bill
of
exceptions.
now,
there
--
there
can
be
no
argument.
the
language
of
canon
19
is
clear
and
there
can
be
no
argument
about
its
language
and
its
content.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
judge
schnackenberg
was
correct
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
when
he
stated
that
this
was
not
a
question
to
say
that
--
that
to
demonstrate
that
the
man
did
not
have
due
process
of
law,
this
was
in
our
situation,
demonstrate
the
man
did
not
have
due
process
of
law
at
the
trial
level.
there
is
nothing
concerning
his
testimony
that
would
indicate
such
and
we
submit
that
to
this
court.
if
the
court
has
no
further
question,
although
my
time
is
not
up
why,
i
--
i
feel
that
i've
covered
this
thing
from
the
state's
point
of
view.
the
court
well
knows
we
argued
this
thing
once
before
on
these
same
grounds
quite
extensively.
we
--
the
court
has
the
record
before
of
the
opinions
of
the
judges,
the
various
judges
that
have
participated
in
this
from
the
indiana
supreme
court
to
judge
parkinson,
judge
schnackenberg
the
first
time,
judge
schnackenberg
the
second
time
and
the
dissenting
opinions
of
judge
duffy.
i
--
i
even
feel
that
it's
presumptuous
of
me
to
address
the
court
in
the
first
place
here.
it
seems
that
it's
quite
well
covered.
i
would
be
happy
if
this
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
--
i
can
only
say
this,
your
honor,
that
they,
likewise,
like
yourselves,
had
been
subjected
to
a
full-dress
argument
in
the
complete
briefs
in
this
matter
previously.
and
the
--
although
they
had
decided
the
question
eventually
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
--
the
first
time
on
the
procedural
question
of
the
escape,
which
you
will
probably
recall,
but
they
did
nevertheless
hear
a
full-dress
argument
on
the
entire
question
of
whether
or
not
he
had
been
afforded
his
constitutional
right
in
--
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
from
the
state
court.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
judge
parkinson
who
at
the
time
this
was
heard
in
the
federal
district
court
had
also
conducted
a
full-scale
hearing
in
the
matter,
in
fact,
it
was
through
his
hearing
that
this
bill
of
exceptions
arrive
--
arrives
here
as
part
of
the
evidence.
judge
parkinson
gave
that
a
full
treatment
and
wrote
a
complete
opinion
which
has
been
cited
to
this
court
of
course.
and
i
think
that
it
was
a
--
simply
a
question
that
they
felt
that
they
were
fully
informed
that
there
was
no
use
to
send
it
back
to
the
district
court
that
he
had
dealt
with
it
in
every
possible
aspect
and
so
that
the
--
therefore,
the
decision
was
up
to
them.
they
had
heard
full
argument
and
full
brief
and
we
made
no
complaint
and
i
don't
believe
the
petitioner
here
through
his
attorneys
made
any
complaint.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that
is
--
mr.
richard
m.
givan
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
judge
latham
castle
who
had
previously
been
the
attorney
general
of
the
illinois
had
taken
judge
lindley's
place
on
the
bench
and
he
had
not
heard
the
full
argument
of
--
however,
of
course,
being
(voice
overlap)
mr.
richard
m.
givan
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
and
judge
duffy
dissented.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
givan
that's
correct.
but
then
i
think
that
was
for
the
--
i
don't
think
it's
up
to
any
of
us
to
be
critical
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
acting
in
that
fashion
and
as
i
say,
i
think
they
were
fully
apprised,
in
fact,
i
don't
--
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
rules
that
would
require
them
to
have
an
oral
argument
as
a
matter
of
fact.
they
had
the
briefs
before
them
and
they
could
decide
it
upon
the
briefs
if
they
saw
fit.
and
as
i
say
there
was
no
objections
raised
and
there
has
been
none
raised
here
by
a
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
they
were
deprived
with
anything
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
the
action
of
the
court
in
that
--
acting
in
that
fashion.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
why,
that
would
conclude
the
state's
presentation
in
this
matter.
thank
you.
