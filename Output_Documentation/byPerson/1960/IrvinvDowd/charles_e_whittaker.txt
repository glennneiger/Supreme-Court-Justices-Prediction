that
order
of
taking
jurisdiction,
it
was
sent
(inaudible)
reversed
to
the
district
judge,
and
that
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

justice
charles

not.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
what's
the
question
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
bystander
statements.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
what
i
call
a
bystander's
exception.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
page
are
you
reading
from?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
has
he
been
arrested
and
held
in
that
length
of
time
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
upon
the
suspicion
of
these
murders
or
of
something
else?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
had
understood.
maybe
i
am
falling
with
my
recollection
about
this
that
as
the
matter
of
the
murders
came
up
incidentally
while
it
was
being
held
on
these
other
offences,
am
i
wrong
about
that
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
on
--
just
as
state
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
they
had
an
unshakable
conviction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
fixed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
was
the
minute
you,
if
i
may
ask
you,
accepted
on
this
jury
to
proved
did
not
qualify
under
the
provisions
of
the
indiana
statute
leaving
aside
the
moment
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
as
i
understand
it
that
your
statute
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
on
page
24
to
26
of
your
brief,
he
sets
forth,
as
it
is,
(inaudible)
somewhat
different
than
those
given,
question
--
in
other
words,
he
could
be
entitled
in
your
mind
that
all
times
when
the
(inaudible)
until
the
state
of
indiana
pleaded
guilty
beyond
reasonable
doubt,
is
that
right?
actually,
yes,
sir,
that's
right.
(inaudible)
page.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
that
did
--
did
use
(inaudible)
who
didn't
qualify
under
this
statute
putting
aside
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
--
did
his
answers
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
like
did
his
answers
come
within
that
statute
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
somebody
has
to
make
a
determination,
if
the
statute,
yes,
and
the
court
if
satisfied
still
the
same.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
over
basis
upon
which
the
court
did
soundly
exercise
the
discretion.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
long
does
(inaudible)
is
this
--
this
is
a
--
this
is
an
old
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
done
isn't
--
to
argue
that
having
done
it,
taking
advantage
of
that
opportunity
to
now
claim
that
in
the
minds
of
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
you
give
us
--
if
i
may
ask
you.
can
you
give
us
any
of
the
light
on
why
it
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
an
order
on
one
day
electing
to
repeat
the
case
rather
than
the
circuit
--
the
district
court
and
in
the
next
day,
decided
it
without
giving
the
opportunity
for
argument
to
this?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
there
was
one
new
judge
on
the
seventh
circuit
who
had
not
prayed
full
argument
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(voice
overlap)
argument?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
judge
duffy
dissented.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that
we
should
decide
it
by
one
judge
and
heard
the
argument,
one
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
status
quo,
you
mean
back
to
evansville?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
had
to
go
(inaudible)
west
or
east
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
south.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
river.
now,
you
went
north?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
makes
you
think
you've
gone
better
than
east
to
west?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
far,
long
way?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
he
out
on
parole
at
the
time?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
did
you
want?
did
you
want
for
me
to
--
as
soon
as
jurors
would
qualify,
take
them
separately.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
keep
also
prospective
jurors
out
and
only
the
one
being
examined
the
presence
tribunal.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
(inaudible)
it's
--
if
the
qualification
and
not
the
statute,
then
it
becomes
a
question
of
whether
the
statute
itself
is
constitutionally
valid
for
due
process
reasons,
isn't
that
right?
