justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
one
more
question?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
language
in
vepco's
easement
its
right
to
flow
that
gives
them
agricultural
accretion
where
it
uses
or
--
or
is
it
just
their
right
to
flow?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
that
not
a
personal
release
by
the
falkland
estate
to
the
gratitude
of
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
your
claim,
mr.
farrell?
let's
see
if
i
can
--
would
you
understand?
do
you
think
this
malice
should
be
arrived
at
as
though
the
government
were
taking
this
right
to
flow
from
the
key
owner
and
its
value
to
be
assessed
on
that
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
the
government's
easement
had
to
be
valued.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
what
date
would
taking
have
to
be
valued?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
value
would
be
the
same
whether
taken
from
you
or
from
mrs.
williams.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
he
got
to
say
that
having
gotten
title
from
mrs.
williams
to
that
right
to
flow,
the
damages
go
to
you
and
not
her.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
only
such
are
being
taken.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
own
--
did
you
own
the
so-called
residue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
didn't
you
get
the
damage
for
damage
to
the
--
unawarded
damage
to
the
residue?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
ferrell,
please?
how
could
you
have
damages
for
the
taking
of
your
privilege
to
flow
if
you
have
no
legal
right
to
flow?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
had
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
you
did
come
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
increase?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
did
you
know
that
mrs.
williams,
the
fee
owner,
stands
in
a
very
different
position
than
you
do
who
merely
held
the
right
to
flow
for
she
have
all
other
elements
of
property
in
this
real
estate.
now
then,
she
curved
out
a
portion
of
that
and
gave
it
to
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
a
consideration,
and
you
bought.
now,
sitting
here
trying
to
bring
this
thing
down
to
prior
forms
to
get
the
couplet
out
of
my
mind,
i
wonder
if
these
were
true
that
the
value
should
be
determined
as
against
the
fee
owner
of
this
easement.
and
then
to
deduct
from
it
--
i
mean,
then
to
assume
that
it's
been
assigned
to
you
but
i
think
that
failed
because
you
didn't
get
all
she
own,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
she
got
only
a
part,
the
right
to
flow.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
i'm
assuming
up
--
just
321.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
now
the
matters
conveyed
to
you
by
--
by
mrs.
williams,
would
that
still
left
true
with
everything
else.
it
would
be,
didn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so,
all
the
government
can
take
from
you
is
what
you
have
and
that's
the
right
to
flow.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
you
have
ever
a
right
to
flow,
how
can
you
be
damaged?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
here,
you
have
a
special
circumstance
by
virtue
of
the
twin
city
case.
and
absent
--
if,
of
course,
that
would
be
true
but
this
case
says
the
right
to
flow
is
in
the
united
states,
the
right
to
dam
that
river.
and
you
cannot
do
it
because
and
never
can
because
united
states
has
exercised
that
privilege.
how
then
could
you
claim
damages
by
reason
of
the
taking
of
your
right
to
flow
when
you
never
could
have
exercised
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
it
have
after
the
united
states
elected
to
build
the
dam
and
(voice

--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
destroys
it.
they're
always
subject
to
this
exercise
of
the
governmental
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
now
that
would
be
true
as
between
the
government
and
mrs.
williams.
but
you
only
get
a
part
of
that
of
first
thing.
and
for
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
therefore,
you're
limited,
are
you
not,
to
the
value
of
what
you
own
that
the
government
took?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
--
values
before
and
after
has
a
built
in
severance
damage
factor
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
it.
and
that
would
be
a
correct
rule
as
applied
to
the
owner
of
the
fee
who
is
entitled
to
the
severance
damage.
there
is
a
different
question
of
what
was
(inaudible)
immediately
before
as
oppose
to
immediately
act
of
the
taking.
but
here
where
you
do
not
have
anything
but
a
right
to
flow,
aren't
you
limited
by
different
rules
simply
to
the
value
of
that
property?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
of
what
she
gave
in
this
(inaudible)
--
it
is
justified
to
this
question
that
she
gave
to
vepco
the
right
to
flow.

that
the
admissive

by
aiming
as
an

compensation

would
favor?
