mr.

may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
be
sure
that
i
understand
your
position.
you
told
us
assuming
that
all
the
government
needed
was
up
to
321
assuming
that
both
your
records
and
their
plan
--
that
plan
taking
this
up
to
321
forgetting
about
the
difference
between
321
and
330.
you've
told
us
that
they
didn't
need
to
deal
with
mrs.
williams
at
all
that
they
could
simply
and
should
simply
have
dealt
with
you
and
acquired
property
right
you
already
have,
that
is
the
easement
that
had
been
conveyed
to
you.
well,
i
wouldn't
--
though
--
there'd
be
damage
to
the
residue
per
property
owned
by
her
--
justice
potter

--
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
that
had
been
granted
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
had
also
been
granted
to
you
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
has
she
offered
this
--all
this
land
for
$1
to
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
all
it
is,
this
nine
feet
over
this
long
--
justice

(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this.
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you
answered
that
question.
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
morton,
what
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
instead
of
acquiring
this
for
the
purposes
of
a
power
--
water
power
project
which
the
federal
government
had
wanted
the
same
property
to
build
a
federal
building
on
it,
build
an
army
camp,
it
would
have
to
compensate
the
--
the
respondent,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what?
between
the
commerce
power
and
what?
justice
potter
stewart
well,

didn't
give
it.

sold
it.
