mr.
perry
w.
morton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
condemnation
case
at
an
earlier
stage
was
here
once
before
in
your
october
1955
term.
an
earlier
judgment
against
the
united
states
in
favor
of
this
respondent
was
then
vacated
by
you
and
the
case
was
remanded
for
further
consideration
in
the
light
of
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
twin
city
power
company
that
you
had
decided
the
week
before.
it
was
in
the
twin
city
case
that
you
held
that
when
the
united
states
builds
a
water
project
on
a
navigable
stream
and
condemns
riparian
land
for
that
purpose,
any
element
of
value
arising
from
the
availability
of
the
land
for
water
power
purposes
must
be
excluded
in
the
fixing
of
compensation.
but
of
course
in
twin
city,
you
held
that
after
excluding
water
power
value,
enhancement
of
the
land
due
to
water's
power
site
value,
there
would
still
be
an
obligation
of
the
government
which
we
readily
recognize
in
this
case
to
pay
for
any
other
values
which
might
be
inherent
in
the
fee
type.
now,
while
i
will
summarize
the
facts
of
the
present
case
in
a
moment,
i
wish
to
emphasize
at
the
threshold
certain
very
important
factual
differences
which
are
these.
in
twin
city,
the
bulk
of
the
land
which
the
government
condemned
in
fee
was
held
by
twin
city
in
fee.
but
in
the
present
case,
the
government
made
a
settlement
fully
satisfactory
to
the
owner
in
fee
simple
and
the
respondent
power
company
held
only
a
flowage
easement,
an
easement
to
plug
related
to
the
development
of
the
water
power
of
this
navigable
stream.
and
so
it
is
that
in
the
present
case,
the
basic
question
in
the
government's
view
is
whether
the
government
is
required
to
pay
this
power
company
respondent
any
compensation
for
the
frustration
of
a
flowage
easement
it
owned
once
upon
a
time
over
land
riparian
to
an
interstate
navigable
stream.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
had
a
piece
of
paper
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
paper
was
still
on
record
your
honor.
i'll
develop
the
refinements
of
that
at
--
a
little
later.
we
say
that
we
do
not
have
to
pay
any
compensation
where
the
only
value
such
flowage
easement
could
possibly
have
was
directly
dependent,
necessarily
dependent
upon
a
permission
which
the
government
has
the
constitutional
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
grant
or
withhold
and
which
it
had
never
granted.
now,
the
essential
facts,
beyond
dispute
as
far
as
the
issues
before
the
court
at
this
time,
are
concerned
are
these,
the
dan
river
is
the
principal
tributary
of
the
roanoke
river
and
is
a
navigable
stream.
in
1944,
congress
authorized
the
construction
of
the
buggs
island
reservoir
now
known
on
has
the
john
h.
kerr
dam
and
reservoir
on
the
roanoke
river
in
virginia
and
north
carolina
as
a
multipurpose
project
for
navigation,
flood
control,
and
the
development
of
water
power.
that
is
the
project
involved
in
this
case.
you
may
be
familiar
with
it
from
your
1953
consideration
of
the
case
of
chapman
versus
federal
power
commission
in
which
you
approved
the
license
issued
by
the
federal
power
commission
to
this
very
same
respondent
to
construct
the
roanoke
rapid
site,
so
far
of
this
downstream
of
the
eleven
possible
sites
on
the
roanoke
basin,
whereas
this
is
the
buggs
island
project
referred
to
in
that
case
as
the
highest
upstream
and
was
of
course
built
by
the
government.
now,
this
congressional
decision
to
build
this
project
made
in
1944
is
just
as
immune
from
judiciary
reexamination
as
was
the
same
decision
in
twin
city
which
involved
exactly
the
same
authorizing
act
of
the
congress.
on
the
execution
of
the
authority
given
by
this
act,
the
government
required
and
condemned
a
flowage
easement
over
considerable
areas
of
land,
the
project
extends
for
miles,
which
would
be
flooded
behind
this
dam.
this
is
in
the
very
upper
reaches
of
the
reservoir
area,
which
would
be
flooded
behind
this
dam
permanently
or
intermittently
including
1840
acres
of
a
7400-acre
tract,
commonly
known
as
the
falkland
estate
owned
by
a
mrs.
williams
who
is
not
a
party
to
this
controversy.
this
respondent
power
company,
theretofore,
owned
easements
which
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument
at
least,
would
have
aggregately
on
their
face
permitted
it
to
flood
permanently
for
water
power
development
purposes
as
against
mrs.
williams
and
her
granddaughters,
a
total
of
1540
acres
of
the
same
1840
acres
which
the
government
condemned
its
flowage
easement
of.
now,
respondent's
easements
on
this
1540
acres
would
allow
flooding
just
to
put
two
or
three
figures
in
your
minds,
up
to
contour
elevation,
321
feet
mean
sea
level
whereas
the
easement
which
the
government
acquired
is
to
flood
the
williams'
land
permanently
or
intermittently
up
to
contour
330
feet
mean
sea
level
as
required
in
the
operation
of
the
government
project
as
constructed.
as
a
result
of
correspondence
initiated
by
the
attorney
for
mrs.
williams,
the
fee
owner
more
than
two
years
prior
to
the
commencement
of
this
case,
the
government
accepted
from
mrs.
williams
an
option
for
the
purchase
of
a
flowage
easement
over
the
entire
1840
acres
previously
mentioned
for
a
consideration
of
$1
and
other
valuable
considerations
the
receipt
and
sufficiency
of
which
were
thereby
acknowledged.
this
preliminary
correspondence
shows
that
the
landowner
urged
the
government
to
accept
only
a
flowage
easement
instead
of
acquiring
the
entire
fee
simple
title
as
it
had
in
twin
city.
because
the
falkland
estate
and
i
might
say
it
was
the
general
policy
to
acquire
the
fee-simple
title
but
we
were
urged
to
grant
--
to
take
only
a
flowage
easement
because
the
falkland
estate
and
now
i
want
to
pick
out
excerpts
from
the
attorney's
letter,
that's
the
entire
7400
acres,
had
long
"been
devoted
exclusively
to
conservation
of
wild
life
and
is
a
well-known
game
preserve
which
would
be
badly
cut
up,"
said
the
attorney
if
the
government
took
the
entire
fee-simple
title
whereas
leaving
the
fee-simple
title
in
the
property
--
to
the
property
in
the
landowners
would
he
said,
"go
a
long
way
in
alleviating
the
difficulty."
well,
this
option
eventually
exercised
--
executed
rather
by
the
landowner
and
accepted
by
the
government
reserved
to
the
landowner
"all
such
rights",
and
“privileges
as
may
be
used
and
enjoyed
without
interfering
with
the
interest
of
the
united
states
and
was
made
subject
only
to"
and
i
continue
quote
"such
water
flowage,
riparian
and
other
rights
if
any,
which
the
virginia
electric
and
power
company
has
in
or
to
or
rather
on
is
the
word,
the
above
described
lands.”
the
option
further
contained
an
express
provision
that
the
government
might
at
its
election,
acquire
the
title
to
the
rights
described
in
the
option
agreement
by
condemnation
instead
of
by
deed
and
that
in
the
event
of
condemnation,
the
landowner
would
accept
the
considerations
explicit
and
implicit
in
the
option
arrangement
as
full
compensation.
exercising
this
election,
the
government
instituted
this
condemnation
case
in
1952
and
the
record
is
specific
at
several
points
that
the
landowner
has
continuously
disclaimed
any
interest
whatsoever
in
any
further
compensation
or
consideration.
and
so
the
controversy
here
presented,
is
and
always
has
been
strictly
between
the
government
and
this
power
company.
now,
the
case
was
first
tried
in
january,
1954
and
a
judgment
was
then
entered
for
$61,600
in
favor
of
the
power
company.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
sir.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
complaint
simply
describes
and
the
declaration
of
taking
to
at
the
earliest
part
of
the
record.
the
nature
of
the
estate
which
the
government
wanted
that
is
to
flow
permanently
or
intermittently
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
over
certain
described
parcels
which
were
set
out
in
appendix
to
the
complaint
by
a
full
legal
description.
and
the
--
the
parties
are
then
named
as
parties
having
an
interest
or
a
possible
interest
in
the
property.
i
would
recall
to
you
perhaps
the
93-acre
case,
the
illinois
aircraft
case
about
two
years
ago
now
in
which
you
said
of
course
that
the
mere
jointer
of
a
party,
the
mere
bringing
of
a
domain
proceeding
against
a
party
is
not
necessarily
a
recognition
of
an
interest
that
that
party
may
have.
this
forum
may
be
tested
to
determine
the
existence
of
such
an
interest.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
the
recess
from
the
morning
hour,
i
was
at
the
point
of
saying
that
the
case
was
first
tried
in
january
1954
resulting
in
a
judgment
for
$61,600
in
favor
of
the
power
company.
the
only
valuation
evidence
offered
at
that
trial
was
by
the
power
company.
and
it
related
to
the
fee
simple
value
of
the
1540
acres
covered
by
the
power
company's
easement
excluding
only
merchantable
timber,
which
i
insert
parenthetically
by
arrangements
with
the
government.
mrs.
williams
had
been
permitted
to
remove
out
of
all
the
area
that
would
be
covered
by
the
power
coop.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
say
all
of
the
timber
was
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
permitted
to
be
removed
out
of
the
area
that
would
be
covered
by
the
power
coop.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
and
as
before
stated,
you
granted
certiorari,
vacated
the
judgment,
remanded
the
case
for
further
consideration
in
the
light
of
your
twin
city
decision
the
week
before.
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
was
constrained
to
recognize
that
under
the
twin
city
decision,
there
could
be
no
recovery
against
the
united
states
or
rights
which
would
have
value
only
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
water
power
of
a
navigable
stream.
but
in
returning
the
case
to
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
directed
that
there'd
be
an
award
to
the
power
company
of
compensation
for
the
taking
of
the
government's
easement.
excluding
from
the
valuation,
any
element
of
value
arising
from
the
availability,
these
are
its
words,
"of
the
land
for
water
power
purposes
due
to
it's
being
situate
on
a
navigable
stream,
but
including,"
and
i
resume,
"other
elements
of
value
not
related
to
the
flow
of
the
stream
such
as
its
value
for
agricultural
or
grazing
purposes".
along
the
return
of
the
case
to
the
district
court,
the
commissioners
were
appointed
under
rule
71a
(h)
and
were
instructed
to
return
their
answers
to
four
specific
questions
insisting
on
its
position
that
the
power
company's
flowage
easements
could
have
no
possible
value
as
against
the
united
states.
the
government
again
offered
no
valuation
evidence
at
the
retrial
before
the
commissioners
in
june
of
1958.
and
after
a
further
hearing
before
the
court,
the
district
court
that
is,
in
november
of
1958,
the
court
entered
judgment
against
the
united
states
in
favor
of
the
power
company,
this
time
for
$65,520
plus
interest.
in
doing
this,
the
court
held
that
the
second
of
its
inquiries
to
the
commissioners
was
and
i
quote,
"the
appropriate
measure
of
value
or
compensation"
is
the
word.
that
second
inquiry
had
directed
the
commission
to
determine
the
difference
between
the
fair
market
value
of
this
falkland
estate
that
belonged
to
mrs.
williams.
the
tract
of
7400
acres
with
and
without
the
servitude
of
the
government's
easement,
except
that
it
would
assume
for
that
purpose
that
the
easement,
the
government's
easement
covered
only
the
1540
acres
covered
by
vepco's
easement
up
to
contour
321
instead
of
330
and
excluding
from
both
of
such
valuations
any
element
of
value
arising
from
the
availability
of
such
land
for
water
power
development
purposes
due
to
it's
being
situate
riparian
to
a
navigable
stream.
and
in
making
their
report,
the
commissioners
stated
that
$11,720
of
the
total
difference
of
$65,520
represented
"damages
to
the
residue"
of
the
falkland
estate.
well,
the
government
again
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
again
affirmed.
and
at
that
point,
you
have
brought
the
case
here.
on
these
facts,
we
think
that
the
courts
below
have
persisted
in
trying
the
wrong
case.
and
we
are
here
in
an
effort
to
get
the
right
case
at
long
last
decided.
in
the
government's
view,
there
is
a
very
simple
syllogism
which
requires
a
conclusion
favorable
to
the
government
against
the
power
company.
the
major
premise
of
this
syllogism
is
based
upon
your
decision
in
the
twin
city
case
that
when
the
government,
in
the
exercise
of
its
commerce
power,
appropriates
the
flow
of
a
navigable
stream
for
a
government
project,
it
is
not
obligated
to
pay
those
elements
of
property
value
which
are
solely
dependent
upon
the
flow
of
the
navigable
stream.
and
the
minor
premise
of
the
syllogism
is
bottomed
upon
such
cases
as
boston
chamber
of
commerce
against
boston,
messer
against
united
states,
the
southern
california
fishermen's
association
case,
united
states
against
petty
motors
that
where
the
united
states
settles
with
the
owner
of
one
interest
in
property,
the
question
of
compensation
for
all
interests
is
irrelevant
and
only
the
question
of
just
compensation
for
the
interest
taken
concerns
the
government.
now,
i'll
come
back
to
that
minor
premise
for
a
little
further
development
in
a
little
bit.
but
i
want
to
deal
first
with
this
major
premise
based
on
twin
city,
currently
very
much
dispute
about
it.
this
case,
like
twin
city
and
chandler-dunbar
is
one
in
which
the
united
states
has
chosen
to
exercise
its
commerce
power
to
the
fullest
extent
in
the
building
of
this
project.
indeed,
the
project,
as
i
have
previously
noted,
and
the
twin
city
project
were
adopted,
authorized
and
constructed
under
the
very
same
authorizing
act
of
congress.
here,
for
the
same
reasons
and
to
the
same
extent
to
paraphrase
your
language
in
twin
city,
the
united
states
has
displaced
all
competing
interests
and
has
appropriated
the
entire
flow
of
the
river
at
this
point
to
the
declared
public
purpose.
and
for
the
same
reasons,
this
is
not
such
a
situation
as
those
involved
in
the
gerlach
livestock
company
case
or
the
niagara
mohawk
power
corporation
case
where
the
action
of
congress,
as
you
have
said,
fell
short
of
a
full
exercise
of
its
constitutional
power
to
appropriate
the
flow
of
the
river
to
the
public
domain
so
that
prior
rights
existing
under
state
law
were
in
those
cases,
gerlach
and
niagara
mohawk
held
compensable
or
otherwise
recognized.
now,
by
even
the
stronger
reason,
we
can
put
aside,
as
you
did
in
twin
city,
such
other
cases
as
united
states
against
kansas
city
life
upon
which
the
respondent
seems
so
strongly
to
rely.
the
basic
lesson
to
be
learned
from
twin
city
is
that
when
the
government
exercises
its
commerce
power
to
the
fullest
extent
without
any
qualifications,
competing
interests
are
displaced
without
compensation
being
required
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
extent,
and
i
agree
only
to
the
extent,
that
those
interests
have
a
value
which
is
dependent,
necessarily
and
solely
upon
the
flow
of
the
navigable
stream,
a
value
which
the
government
can
either
grant
or
withhold
as
it
chooses.
and
as
you
have
so
recently
as
last
june
in
the
grand
river
dam
case
said
that
if
the
government
does
not
grant
it,
it
is
beholden
to
no
one.
now,
that
has
been
the
government's
major
premise
in
this
case
from
the
very
beginning
long
before
twin
city,
long
before
grand
river
as
may
be
seen
from
the
government's
original
trial
brief.
in
1953,
which
vepco
has
done
us
the
favor
of
inserting
in
its
appendix,
page
214
and
following
of
the
record,
"vepco
counsel
has
through
the
years
indulged
in
much
talked
about
the
government
changing
its
position."
well,
let
the
record
speak
for
itself.
in
that
context,
however,
it
may
be
appropriate
for
me
to
point
out
that
vepco's
original
answer
to
interrogatories
record
22.
it
claimed
compensation
measured
by
the
value
of
its
flowage
easement
"for
water
power
development
purposes"
and
no
other.
under
the
stress
of
your
remand
of
the
case
in
early
1956
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
twin
city,
vepco,
of
course,
had
to
find
a
new
theory.
a
theory
which
we
insist
still
gives
its
something
for
nothing.
obedient
to
your
decision
in
twin
city,
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
held
of
course
that
vepco
was
not
entitled
to
values
inherent
in
the
flow
of
the
stream.
and
i
do
not
understand
that
vepco
is
now
claiming
such
values
or
could.
so,
while
the
government's
major
premise
is
by
no
means
to
be
lost
sight
of,
i
would
take
it
that
the
premise
is
now
conceded
by
both
vepco
and
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
at
the
outset
of
the
government's
second
point,
its
minor
premise
so
to
speak,
i
ask
you
to
examine
what
it
was
that
vepco
had.
the
government
has
never
contested
that
vepco
once
had
certain
rights
against
the
fee
owner.
in
the
first
place,
it
once
had
rights
as
against
the
fee
owner.
originating
in
the
year
1907,
this
is
a
paraphrase
of
the
language
of
its
basic
instruments,
“to
construct
and
maintain
a
dam
in
the
dan
river
and
thereby
to
raise
the
water
level
at
the
head
of
hyco
falls
six
feet
above
normal.
in
the
second
place,
it
once
had
rights
as
against
the
fee
owner
originating
this
time
in
1925
to
build,
i'm
quoting
now
excerpts,
"to
build,
to
rebuild
and
again
to
build
any
dam
or
dams
it
might
desire
across
the
dan
river,"
so
that
the
normal
water
level
behind
said
dam
shall
not
be
higher
than
what
the
government
concedes
here
to
be
contour
321,
resume
quote,
"together
with
all
riparian
rights,
water
rights,
easements
and
rights
of
floodage
related
to
the
building
of
such
dam
on
the
so-called
falkland
estate,"
which
estate
released
vepco's
predecessor
from
any
damages
for,
and
i
again
resume
quote,
"anything
done
within
the
limits
of
its
rights
aforesaid
in
the
development
of
the
water
power
aforesaid".
in
other
words,
the
very
documents
upon
which
vepco
rests
and
indeed
must
rest
its
claim
of
interest.
and
i
would
remind
you
that
it
has
the
burden
of
proving
its
interest
show
explicitly
that
the
only
easement
rights
which
it
possessed
as
against
the
owner
of
the
fee
simple
title,
were
the
very
rights,
which
it
could
not
lawfully
exercise
without
the
formal
consent
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
prospect
of
any
such
consent
ever
being
given
vanished,
disappeared,
expired,
terminated.
as
early
as
1944,
this
case
was
brought
in
1952,
as
early
as
1944
when
the
united
states
decided
to
build
its
own
project
at
this
location
on
its
own
account.
now
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
yes,
sir.
there
has
never
been
any
question
in
this
case
that
mrs.
williams
held
a
fee
simple
title
to
the
so-called
falkland
estate
at
the
time
of
the
commencement
of
this
case.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
she
still
owns
that
fee
title.
the
government
took
only
a
flowage
easement
on
that
estate
in
strictest
accord
with
the
option
agreement
previously
negotiated
with
mrs.
williams
at
her
own
urgent
request
and
mrs.
williams
is
fully
satisfied
with
that
settlement
and
is
honorably
and
consistently
claiming
no
further
or
different
compensation.
i
insist
that
this
respondent
power
company,
which
once
had
only
a
flowage
easement
for
power
purposes
on
1540
acres
of
the
1840
acres
covered
by
the
government's
easement
had
and
has
no
right
whatever
as
a
matter
of
fact
or
law
to
question
the
settlement
arrangement
between
mrs.
williams
and
the
government
for
that
is
precisely
none
of
its
business.
now,
as
already
noted,
the
situation
in
this
case
differs
from
twin
city
in
respect
to
the
fact
that
in
twin
city,
the
company
owned
in
fee
simple
the
bulk
of
the
land
which
the
government
condemned
in
fee.
twin
city
was
therefore
entitled
to
compensation
for
any
other
elements
of
value,
agricultural
values,
timber,
forestry,
anything
else,
any
other
elements
of
value.
it
could
prove
within
the
rules
for
determining
just
compensation
excluding
power
site
value.
the
government
does
not
contend
that
the
fee
owner
is
not
entitled
to
such
other
values
according
to
the
usual
rules.
if
we
had
not
settled
with
mrs.
williams
in
this
case,
on
the
basis
entirely
satisfactory
to
her,
we
would
long
since
have
tried
the
issue
of
just
compensation
with
her.
but
that
is
not
this
case
and
no
amount
of
the
confusion
with
which
the
case
seems
to
be
beset
can
make
it
so.
power
rights
which
mrs.
williams
would
have
had
to
compensation
in
the
absence
of
a
settlement
can
somehow
now
rub
off
on
vepco
involves
a
process
of
osmosis
or
alchemy,
which
i
utterly
fail
to
understand.
and
yet
that,
in
its
simplest
terms,
is
the
basis
on
which
the
case
has
been
tried
ever
since
you
vacated
the
prior
judgment
and
remanded
the
case
in
1956.
now,
vepco
says
that
a
condemnation
is
a
proceeding
in
rem
and
we
wholeheartedly
agree.
we
insist
that
the
only
raise
involved
in
this
controversy
is
the
flowage
easement
which
vepco
held.
vepco
says
that
just
compensation
is
to
be
fixed
without
regard
to
the
various
interests
in
land
and
that
the
government
is
not
concerned
with
distribution.
and
again,
this
unit
rule
is
the
general
rule
and
we
readily
concede
it.
in
fact,
the
government
is
first
--
is
the
first
to
champion
this
rule
when
it
applies.
we
go
straight
down
the
line
with
the
great
mass
of
cases
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
support
of
this
proposition,
the
unit
rule.
we
insist,
however,
that
the
unit
principle
does
not
apply
when
the
unit
no
longer
exists
as
when
the
parties
themselves
have
destroyed
the
unit,
as
they
did
in
the
boston
chamber
of
commerce
case
or
when
the
government
has
already
settled
with
the
owner
of
one
interest
as
it
did
in
the
petty
motor,
the
messer,
the
southern
california
fishermen's
and
so
on
cases.
in
the
boston
case,
you
long
ago
held,
it
was
mr.
justice
holmes
i
believe
in
1910
that
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
quote,
"does
not
require
a
disregard
of
the
mode
of
ownership
of
the
state
of
the
title".
it
does
not
require
that
a
parcel
of
land
be
valued
as
an
unencumbered
whole
when
it
is
not
held
as
an
unencumbered
whole.
it
merely
requires
that
an
owner
of
property
taken
should
be
paid
for
what
has
been
taken
from
him.
and
the
messer
case,
in
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
authority
of
your
petty
motor
decision
and
i
might
insert
that
the
southern
california
fishermen's
case
at
long
beach
was
almost
exactly
the
same
as
the
messer
case.
the
messer
case
said
very
pertinently
that,
"whereas
here,
the
government
settles
with
the
owner
of
one
interest
the
question
of
compensation
for
all
interests
is
irrelevant
and
the
only
--
only
the
question
of
just
compensation
for
the
interest
taken
concerns
the
government."
now,
this
exception
to
the
general
rule,
i
want
to
note,
rests
upon
very
sound
public
policy,
the
policy
of
encouraging
settlements
wherever
possible
and
narrowing
controversies
to
their
minimum
number
and
limits.
multiple
hundreds
of
such
partial
settlements
are
made
every
year.
i
know
because
for
seven
and
a
half
years,
i
have
had
a
hand
in
approving
them.
do
you
think
that
such
settlements
would
be
made
if
this
sound
exception
to
the
unit
rule
did
not
protect
the
government
from
paying
twice
for
the
same
thing?
of
course,
they
would
not
be
made.
and
finally,
and
very
subordinately,
i
mentioned
briefly
the
second
heading
of
the
government's
argument
which
has
to
do
with
the
inclusion
in
the
award
of
$11,720
allowed
as
"damages
to
the
residue".
for
the
reasons
amplified
in
our
brief,
such
an
element
of
compensation
to
vepco
is
completely
unsupportable.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
classic
ingredient
--
pardon
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
as
to
mrs.
williams,
there
was
certainly
a
residue.
as
to
vepco,
its
interest
ended
at
1540
acres
is
my
point.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
i
think
that
that
is
just
another
name
for
this
thing.
it
is
called
damages
to
the
residue.
and
i
would
point
out
that
for
the
--
the
classic
ingredients
of
so-called
severance
damages,
unity
of
ownership
in
fee,
unity
of
use,
the
existence
of
a
residue,
simply
are
not
present
in
vepco's
hands.
and
while
this
point
by
itself
would,
i
think,
require
reversal.
it
serves
well
to
accent
the
totality
of
the
lower
court's
basic
errors
by
carrying
these
errors
to
their
absurd
extravagance.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
thank
you.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
their
right
to
flow,
mr.
justice.
the
record
of
those
documents
begins,
there
are
several
of
them,
the
record
begins
at
page
165
that
happens
to
be
the
instrument
that
created
some
rights
that
stemmed
from
--
this
is
one
of
the
later
ones.
the
one
which
i
think
is
the
most
pertinent
is
the
one
beginning
at
record
172.
defendant's
exhibit
c,
a
deed
to
the
middle
virginia
power
company,
which
was
one
of
vepco's
corporate
ancestors,
from
the
falkland
estate
made
in
1925.
now,
there
was
a
lot
of
other
property
conveyed
that
--
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
but
i
would
draw
your
eye
first
to
the
middle
of
page
173
under
the
heading
second.
the
right
to
build,
and
this
was
what
i
was
paraphrasing
in
my
statement
in
chief,
"the
right
to
build,
to
rebuild
and
again
to
build
any
dam
or
dams,
the
said
middle
virginia
power
company
may
desire
across
the
dan
river
at
any
point,"
and
so
on
and
so
on.
and
now
followed
down
about
12
lines,
so
that
the
normal
water
level
behind
said
dam
or
dams
shall
not
be
higher
than
the
extreme
height
to
which
the
--
our
company
has
the
right
to
elevate
the
waters
of
the
dan
river
and
then
down
a
couple
of
lines,
together
with
all
the
riparian
rights,
water
rights,
easements
and
rights
of
floodage"
to
the
ballistic
extent
of
the
said
maximum
normal
water
level
and
so
on.
and
if
you
will
turn
the
page
over
to
third
at
174
of
the
record,
the
right
in
perpetuity
if
you
have
any
charges
therefore
to
abut
dam,
dams
and
so
on,
to
build
its
powerhouse
or
powerhouses
there
on
rights
of
ingress
and
egress
and
so
on.
it
describes
they
have
a
right
to
take
certain
materials
in
connection
with
their
construction
that
they
have
certain
privileges
of
access
during
construction.
i
think
both
vepco
and
we
agree
that
there
are
some
elements
in
here
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
such
as
the
right
to
build
a
dwelling
and
if
they
paid,
i
think
it's
$40,000
an
acre
they
stipulated,
they
pay
a
fee
for
the
dwelling
there
at
the
dam
site.
but
now,
reading
on
to
record
175
under
fourth,
a
little
below
the
middle
of
the
page,
"falkland
estate
does
here
by
covenant
to
run
with
the
land
that
it
does
here
by
grant
and
release
unto
the
power
company
all
claims
for
damages,"
and
so
on,
got
down
a
little
way,
"as
the
result
of
anything
done
or
omitted
to
be
done
by
the
power
company
within
the
limits
of
its
rights
aforesaid
in
the
development
of
the
water
power
aforesaid
of
the
dan
river
including
the
flooding
of
any
of
the
present
land
of
the
said
falkland
estate."
now,
the
next
fifth
on
the
top
of
page
176
is,
of
course,
just
a
--
a
privilege
that
was
given
or
reserved
by
rather
the
falkland
estate
to
have
access
to
the
waters
edge
and
to
take
part
of
domestic
purposes
and
things
of
that
sort.
now,
that
is
basically
the
document
that
we
have
here
under
consideration.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
there
is
an
earlier
one
in
1907,
i
think,
i
should
say
in
fairness
which
is
not
merely
as
elaborate
as
this.
it
developed
out
of
--
i
don't
know.
i'll
find
it
here
in
just
a
minute.
developed
out
of
a
deed
from
the
banister
mills
company
to
the
south
boston
electric
company,
and
i'm
noting
now
at
the
bottom
page
180
and
--
yes,
180
of
the
record
and
it
continues
over
several
--
well,
we
can
really
skip
all
of
181
and
go
to
item
fourth
at
--
near
the
middle
of
182
which
is
the
basic
right
of
floodage
involved
in
this
instrument."
the
water
rights,
water
power
and
water
privileges
owned
by
the
said
banister
mills
company
incident
to
said
land
and
the
privilege
to
construct
a
dam
or
dams
or
other
works
on
said
land
to
raise
the
water
at
the
head
of
hyco
falls
six
feet
above

i
misread,
"six
feet
high
above
the
usual
water
level
without
requiring
compensation
for
any
damages
thereby
to
any
land
owned
by
the
banister
mills
company
on
the
dan
river."
mr.
perry
w.
morton
those
are
the
instruments.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
i'd
be
happy
to,
mr.
justice,
although
it
has
mystified
me
greatly.
i'll
state
my
understanding
here.
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand,
as
i
understand
its
view,
was
that
now,
we
were
to
take
what
i
recognize
to
be
the
usual
flowage
easement
rule.
but
although
--
and
we
were
to
ignore
the
settlement
with
--
with
mrs.
williams
and
we
were
to
apply
the
unit
rule
and
of
course,
the
rule
for
easements,
generally,
is
a
valuation
of
the
sovereignty
state
with
and
without
the
imposition
of
the
easement
involved.
now,
this
was
what
it
said
it
should
be
done.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
don't
quarrel
with
that
as
a
general
proposition.
i
think
that
there
was
error,
a
minor
error
in
adopting
the
second
instead
of
another
one
of
the
inquiries
even
if
that
had
been
an
applicable
rule.
in
other
words,
they
said
you
were
to
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
inquiry.
the
judge
directed
the
commissioners
to
do
this,
please
understand.
to
assume
for
the
purpose
of
this
inquiry,
that
the
government's
easement
came
only
up
to
1540
acres
instead
of
up
over
1840
acres.
now,
i
passed
over
that
error.
i
think
it
is
simply
a
compounding
of
a
basic
error.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
been
considerable
said
about
our
getting
nothing
under
the
options.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that
first.
in
my
opening
statement,
i
thought
i
have
taken
some
character
or
paraphrase
accurately
the
exhibit
which
was
the
first
letter
from
the
attorney
from
mrs.
williams.
you'll
find
it
on
page
record
158
in
which
he
says
precisely
what
i
quoted
it
for,
that
here
was
an
estate
of
7000
acres,
let's
not
take
the
time
to
read
the
whole
thing
now,
but
i
do
address
your
attention
to
it,
estate
of
7000
acres,
and
he
knew
that
we
were
going
to
demand
title
to
the
land
within
the
334th
contour.
and
he
says
this
would
very
badly
cut
up
their
private
game
preserve.
and
wouldn't
we
please
just
take
a
flowage
easement.
now,
i
can
tell
you
because
i
deal
with
such
matters
all
the
time
that
i
could
settle
literally
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
thousands
of
flowage
easement
cases
if
i
could
get
a
policy
which
would
involve
the
taking
of
only
flowage
easements
instead
of
a
fee
title.
people
are
delighted
to
have
private
lakes.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
whether
a
decision
had
been
made.
a
decision
as
to
the
particular
land,
indeed,
had
not
been
made
at
the
inception
of
this
correspondence
april
1950.
and
now
i'm
looking
at
page
159,
the
replying
letter
of
mr.
heasley
(ph)
--
i
mean
to
mr.
heasley
(ph)
by
the
project
engineer.
a
decision
hadn't
been
made
because
the
--
this,
as
i
said
in
my
opening
statement,
was
in
the
highest
reaches
of
the
project
area.
and
up
in
those
reaches,
they
sometimes
do
take
flowage
easements
and
sometimes
they
don't.
individual
decision
had
not
been
made.
but
the
engineer
here
or
rather
the
project
engineer
very
plainly
says
in
the
last
paragraph
of
his
letter,
replying
to
the
first
letter,
"it
has
been
the
policy
to
acquire
a
fee
simple
interest
in
all
lands
within
the
reservoir
area.
however,
your
position
in
this
matter
is
much
appreciated
and
your
letter
is
being
forward
to
the
district
office
for
consideration
and
reply."
now,
that
runs
through
quite
of
course
of
history
and
you'll
find
the
exhibits
here
in
the
following
and
there
was
indeed
a
colonel
of
the
corps
of
engineers
that
i
couldn't
have
possibly
expected
to
know
about
the
chandler-dunbar
case
or
some
of
the
others
who
did
make
the
statement
at
one
time
that
--
"well,
we'll
have
to
close
this
up
with
you,
mrs.
williams,
and
then
we'll
have
to
deal
with
vepco
for
whatever
we
have
to
acquire
from
it."
but
when
they
came
to
writing
contracts,
i
would
refer
you
to
the
option
at
--
which
begin
at
page
58.
there
was
an
implication
that
we
have
got
nothing
under
this.
i
thought
two
that
i
had
covered
that
in
my
opening
statement.
running
through
the
record
here
--
well,
i
would
hesitate
to
consume
the
time
to
do
it
during
an
open
session.
the
only
words
that
do
not
track
here
in
the
option
agreement
with
the
estate
taken
in
the
complaint
and
declaration
of
taking
is
that
where
at
one
point
here,
the
words
"permanently"
or
"intermittently"
were
omitted
in
the
option
agreement
but
were
put
in
the
others.
now,
what
difference
does
that
make?
as
long
as
it
is
a
whole
complete
right
perpetual
to
overflow
as
maybe
necessary
as
a
result
of
the
construction
maintenance
and
operation
of
the
buggs
island
dam
and
reservoir.
now,
all
you
need
to
look
at
is
the
2681-acre
case
decided
about
the
same
time
as
twin
city
in
the
fourth
circuit
involving
this
very
same
project
in
which
the
fourth
circuit
said
very
plainly.
well,
permanently
or
intermittently
this
--
this
is
an
important
element
of
valuation
but
the
whole
thing
is
keyed
to
what
is
necessary
to
operate
the
project.
therefore,
when
words
of
this
kind
are
used
in
a
taking,
what
the
government
gets,
it
is
entitled
to
prove
by
evidence
offered
in
the
case
of
what
the
requirements
of
the
project
are.
and
then
if
later
takes
anymore,
of
course,
it
has
to
pay
for
that
something
that
it
takes
more.
now
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
i
think
you're
pointing
out
to
the
difference
between
the
exercise
here
of
the
commerce
power
which
is
the
key
to
this
case.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
and
the
power
of
eminent
domain
for
any
ordinary
federal
purpose
separated
from
the
full
exercise
of
the
commerce
clause
within
the
meaning
of
the
twin
city
case.
now,
if
i
may
deal
with
--
oh,
i
--
i
want
to
deal
with
this
option
a
moment
more.
what
did
mrs.
williams
give
under
the
option?
everything
is
described
here
precisely
the
same
as
it
is
in
the
declaration
of
taking
and
in
the
complaint.
and
then
she
says,
"reserving
however
to
the
vendor,"
that's
her,
"and
her
assigns,
all
such
rights
and
privileges
as
maybe
used
and
enjoyed
without
interfering
with
or
abridging
the
estate
rights
and
interest
to
be
conveyed
to
the
united
states
in
the
above
described
premises
subject
only,"
this
is
record
63,
"to
the
following
rights
outstanding
in
3rd
persons
namely,"
then
a
paragraph
begins.
so
far,
this
is
a
printed
form
in
the
original."
subject
to
such
water,
flowage,
riparian
and
other
rights,
if
any,
which
the
virginia
electric
&
power
company
has
in
or
on
the
above
described
lands."
now,
there
is
also,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
opening,
another
provision
in
the
option
which
gave
the
government
the
right
to
perfect
its
interest
as
against
mrs.
williams
by
either
of
two
methods,
by
taking
a
deed
which
she
agreed
to
give
or
by
filing
a
condemnation
if
for
any
reason
it
wasn't
satisfied
with
the
deed
situation.
in
this
case,
we
filed
the
condemnation,
exercising
the
privilege
under
this
option.
although
it
isn't
mentioned
in
the
brief,
i
would
--
i
think
the
name
of
the
case
is
the
old
albrecht
case
which
says
that
an
option
is
then
used
as
the
contractual
method
as
a
stipulation
of
settlement
to
determine
the
compensation
within
the
framework
of
the
condemnation
case.
now,
there's
been
something
said
here
about
a
suppose
differentiation
between
a
case
which
rest
wholly
as
chandler-dunbar
did
within
the
bed
of
the
navigable
river
and
something
that
lies
up
above
high-water
mark.
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
is
exactly
the
situation
that
you
dealt
with
in
twin
city.
and
if
there's
any
doubt
about
it,
i
would
like
to
read
this
paragraph
or
at
least
a
part
of
it
from
your
twin
city
decision.
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
225
over
to
the
top
of
226
of
350
u.s."
it
is
argued,
however,
that
the
special
water
rights
value
should
be
awarded
to
owners
of
this
land
since
it
lies
not
in
the
bed
of
the
river
nor
below
high-water
but
above
and
beyond
the
ordinary
high-water
mark."
an
effort
is
made
by
this
argument
to
establish
that
this
private
land
is
not
burdened
with
the
government's
servitude.
the
flaw
in
that
reasoning
is
that
the
landowner
here
seeks
the
value
in
the
flow
of
the
stream
a
value
that
inheres
in
the
government
servitude
and
one
that
under
our
decisions
the
government
can
grant
or
withhold
as
it
chooses.
it
is
no
answer
to
say
that
payment
is
sought
only
for
the
location
value
of
the
fast
lands.
that
special
occasion
value
is
due
to
the
flow
of
the
stream.
and
if
the
united
states
were
required
to
pay
the
judgments
below,
it
would
be
compensating
the
landowner
for
the
increment
of
value
added
to
the
fast
lands
if
the
flow
of
the
stream
were
taken
into
account.
the
twin
city
is
square
on
the
notes.
so
i
would
summarize
very
quickly
in
this
way.
there's
been
something
said
here
about
our
--
suppose
we
could
have
gone
out
and
dealt
with
vepco
alone
and
ignored
mrs.
williams,
oh,
i
submit
that
this
is
a
complete
impossibility.
what
did
she
have?
just
in
plain
real
property
terms.
suppose
that
this
falkland
estate
is
x
in
a
mathematical
formula,
what
she
had
at
one
time
was
x
minus
vepco
which
was
a
right
to
flood
as
against
her
but
which
could
not,
under
any
circumstance,
be
exercised
by
vepco
without
a
permit
or
a
license
rather
from
the
federal
power
commission
under
the
water
power
act.
and
at
the
time
of
the
approval
of
this
project
by
congress
in
1944
or
at
least
by
the
time
congress
became
irrevocably
committed
to
the
building
of
the
project
through
appropriation
and
the
construction
which
was
in
1946,
it
began,
at
least
by
then,
any
possibility
of
there
being
any
value
in
flowage
rights
against
which
the
united
states
are
on
top
of
which,
if
you
please,
the
united
states
had
superimposed
its
constitutional
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
i
make
no
apology
for
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
at
that
moment,
the
vepco's
interest
disappeared
into
thin
air.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
is
--
pardon
me.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
quite
alright.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
if
we
had
made
no
deal
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
with
mrs.
williams
at
all?
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
would
have
tried
this
case
with
mrs.
williams
but
in
that
event
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
then
it
would
be
a
matter
of
distribution.
i
think
the
rule
which
would,
in
that
case,
control,
since
you
have
a
hypothesis
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
i'll
answer
it
with
something
it
isn't
in
the
brief.
there's
another
very
good
old
principle
of
real
property
law
for
which
i
can
give
you
at
least
a
22-page
memorandum
which
i
have
here
in
support.
that
when
an
easement
which
is
created
for
a
specified
purpose
ceases
to
be
accomplishable,
i
mean
the
purpose
ceases
to
be
accomplishable,
the
easement
terminates,
it
ceases
to
exist,
so
getting
back
to
x
minus
vepco,
at
that
moment,
there
was
no
more
minus
vepco
and
it
became
x.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
this
was
the
hypothesis.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that's
right.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
we
would
most
certainly
have
to
deal
with
mrs.
williams.
that's
my
point.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
she
conveyed
a
right.
this
is,
of
course,
through
a
whole
bunch
of
documents
but
her
predecessors
conveyed
a
right
which
would
be
good
as
against
her
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
taking
no
one
else
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
is
an
interest
in
property
and
i
don't
think
we
need,
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
to
define
it
because
whatever
it
is,
that
is
subordinate
to
the
superior
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
oh,
i
think
there
maybe
quite
a
little
question
about
it.
you
might
say
that
it
is
an
easement
of
pertinent
in
the
sense
that
a
flowage
easement
is
necessarily
a
pertinent
to
a
dam
site.
or
if
they
say,
as
they
do,
that
it
is
an
easement
in
gross
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
i
suppose
she
could.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
she
gave
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
that's
right.
she
gave
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
she
gave
the
right
to
flow.
i'm
sure
that's
the
correct
answer.
but
this
was
a
right,
mr.
justice,
which
was
good
only
as
against
her.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
well,
it
gave
--
it
depends
on
the
side
of
the
thing
if
you
look
at
it,
i
suppose.
the
one
point
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
the
one
point
of
view
i
suppose
you're
meaning
from
the
indemnity
standpoint.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
they
acquired
under
this
easement.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
certainly.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
oh,
no.
if
--
if
--
i
miss
the
point
of
your
inquiry.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
she
--
she
couldn't
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
possibly
do
that
because
this,
i
think,
would
run
into
a
direct
collision
with
the
anti-assignment
act
if
it
is
in
terms
of
--
of
transferring
some
right
to
receive
money.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
i
think
she
sold
them
the
right
as
far
as
those
two
parties
were
concerned
for
vepco
the
flow
water
on
her
lands.
she
did
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
this
is
a
completely
empty
right
as
against
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
the
united
states
commerce
clause.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
and
if
mrs.
williams
were
in
court,
we
would
be
thankful
for
this.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
difference
is
that
we
settled
the
thing.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
it
was.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
that
was
part
of
this
x
that
i
have
referred
to.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes,
i
think
that
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
no,
nothing
in
the
latter
to
prevent
her
from
selling
to
vepco
or
fepco
or
to
anybody
else
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
a
right
as
far
as
she
is
concerned.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
the
difference
being,
of
course,
that
vepco,
in
the
one
case,
could
only
build
as
a
licensee
of
the
united
states
in
section
10,
i
think
it
is
10
(d)
of
the
water
power
act
then
--
no,
it
isn't
10
(d),
it's
10
(c).
mr.
perry
w.
morton
involves
--
mr.
perry
w.
morton
--
involves
vepco
paying
damages
in
any
event
if
it
is
a
licensee.
now,
the
plain
difference
is
the
difference
between
the
united
states
building
a
project
itself
and
the
licensee
building
project.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
yes.
mr.
perry
w.
morton
compensation
for
the
right
to
flow,
we
would
favor
any
element
of
agricultural
forestry
or
other
values
inherent
in
the
land
but
not
water
power
values.
if
i
had
that
fuzzed
up,
i'm
terribly
sorry.
i
certainly
can't
see
how
a
flowage
easement
entitles
to
anyone
to
agricultural
values
or
trees
or
the
right
to
raise
animals.
