mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
the
court
please.
the
interest
of
virginia
electric
&
power
company
are
set
out
in
the
exhibit
c,
just
previously
referred
to
the
previous
deeds
and
there
were
very
numerous
deeds
and
the
1970
was
only
a
minor
part
of
the
flowage
rights
over
the
falkland
estate.
we
have
paraphrased
or
quoted
rather
from
the
--
the
basic
provisions
that
are
really
involved
in
this
case
beginning
on
page
7
of
our
brief.
and
opposite
page
7
is
a
chart
which
we
submit
will
help
with
the
understanding
of
the
facts
of
the
case.
and
that
shows
the
7400-acre
tract
of
the
falkland
estate
at
the
confluence
of
the
banister
and
the
dan
rivers.
and
the
dan
river
is
admittedly
a
navigable
river
in
virginia
upstream
from
the
buggs
island
dam.
you
will
see
shaded
there
the
areas
between
contour
321
and
contour
330.
the
top
line
of
contour
330
was
the
extent
of
flowage
under
the
government's
flowage
easement.
the
bottom
line
is
the
agreed
contour
line
was
stipulated
where
that
went
to
between
the
parties
before
the
first
trial.
virginia
electric
&
power
company
was
the
successor.
i
won't
go
through
all
the
steps
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
a
deed,
the
very
next
exhibit
in
the
record,
a
deed
of
january
1942
from
the
plea
owner
making
certain
corrections
in
the
previous
deed
that
i
preferred
to
and
which
is
paraphrased
beginning
on
page
7
which
sets
out
that
the
power
company
had
the
right
to
build
a
dam
on
this
tract
that
you
see
on
page
6
and
also
to
flood
permanently
and
it
was
a
permanent
easement
to
keep
water
at
all
times
up
to
contour
321
of
this
7400-acre
tract.
and
that
was
not
of
course
limited
to
a
dam
on
the
falkland
tract
but
said
any
dam
downstream,
of
course,
from
this
area
that
vepco
or
its
predecessor
entitled,
had
the
right
to
perpetually
and
permanently
overflow
the
land
up
to
contour
321.
there
were
other
rights
in
there
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
should
call
the
court's
attention
since
this
amount
of
damages
to
the
residue
has
been
talked
about
so
much
to
the
fourth
provision
of
the
deed
which
we
quote,
at
the
bottom,
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
7
of
our
brief
which
says
forth,
"falkland
estate
incorporated,
that
hereby
covenant
to
run
with
the
land
that
it
hereby
grant
and
release
all
claims
for
damages
to
the
residue
of
the
real
estate
as
the
result
of
the
flooding
of
any
of
the
present
land
of
the
said
falkland
estate,"
which
is
the
7400
acres.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that
--
that
is
a
release
of
damages
to
the
residue
and
other
claims
too
but
since
--
i'm
directing
my
remarks
just
to
the
damages
to
the
residue,
and
article
6
is
a
provision
where
all
of
these
are
covenants
running
with
the
land.
in
other
words,
we
had,
at
the
date
of
the
taking,
an
easement
in
gross
commercial
assignable
easement
in
gross
to
keep
water
permanently
over
the
land
up
to
contour
321
without
the
payment
of
any
further
compensation
to
the
owner
of
the
underlying
fee.
now,
my
friend
states
that
there
was
a
settlement
in
this
case
with
the
fee
owner.
and
i
am
astounded
because
the
government's
attorney,
at
the
very
outset
of
this
case,
and
it
appears
in
the
record
on
page
34,
said
that
the
government
obtained
"nothing"
under
this
option
agreement.
and
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
responses
to
the
interrogatories
that
we
asked,
"do
you
claim
that
you've
gotten
anything
from
the
fee
owner?"
and
they
said,
"definitely,
no."
we
have
that
set
out
in
our
brief
and
i
won't
take
anymore
time
with
it
on
page
10
where
we
refer
to
the
government's
interrogatories.
and
yet,
my
adversary
says,
and
that's
why
i
think
i'll
have
to
go
on
to
the
facts
of
this
case
a
little
bit
more,
he
says
the
courts
below,
and
they
have
tried
this
thing
or
heard
it
three
times,
have
been
trying
the
wrong
case.
and
it's
only
now
that
we
are
getting
to
the
right
case.
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that's
the
difference
between
us.
we've
been
trying
in
the
court
below
an
entirely
different
case
from
what
i've
heard
up
here
this
morning
or
this
afternoon.
because
when
you
start
out
with
what
the
government
took
and
then
discuss
what
were
the
rights
in
this
land,
there's
no
--
you
--
there's
--
there's
just
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
the
cases
appears
in
the
record
and
the
cases
made
out
here.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
him
a
moment
ago
about
where
in
the
pleadings
did
the
easement
--
vepco's
easements
rights
appear.
well,
he
said
something
about.
answered
that
vepco
was
main
--
a
main
party
to
the
agreement.
well,
that
is
not
true.
vepco
was
not
a
main
party.
they
filed
a
condemnation
preceding
in
rem,
get
so
many
acres
of
land
to
carve
out
of
it,
not
vepco's
easement.
they
carved
out
it
an
easement
to
necessary
for
the
kerr
dam
to
permanently
and
intermittently
overflow
this
land.
and
he
says
that's
exactly
the
same
thing
we
got
on
the
option
agreement.
but
if
you
will
read
the
option
agreement,
it
didn't
describe
the
easement
that
way
and
the
parties
recognized
it
and
although
it's
not
printed
in
the
record
on
--
in
this
case,
i
referred
to
them
in
a
footnote.
they
went
back
in
the
court
below,
the
fee
owner
and
the
government
and
changed
it
and
says,
"insofar
as
i'm
concerned,
that
--
those
easement
rights
are
different."
and
i
submit
that
if
you
compare
the
easement
talked
about
in
the
option
agreement
and
the
easement
content
--
condemn,
the
government
couldn't
operate
without
that
--
without
excessive
additional
damages
under
the
--
under
the
easement
talked
about
in
the
option
agreement.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
if
that
--
that
was
the
way
it
started
out
at
first.
and
despite
the
contention
that
we
have
changed
our
position
--
as
a
brief
answer
to
that,
i
won't
go
in
to
it.
the
--
the
case
was
tried
on
the
theory
of
the
government's
easement
had
to
be
valued
as
step
number
one.
then
step
number
two
was
that,
since
they
were
different
interest
in
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
the
land
taken
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
the
government's
easement
that
they
were
taking,
the
raise
taken
in
here
was
the
government's
easement
described
in
that
complaint
and
the
declaration
of
taking.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
or
anyone
else
and
that's
the
way
they
--
they
tried
the
case.
that's
the
way
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
part
--
only
part
of
the
damages
because
that's
where
and
that
--
of
judge
--
the
chief
judge
parker
mentioned
that
in,
and
i
think,
his
second
--
his
third
opinion
that
in
this
case
that
some
confusion
exist
because
of
that
transfer
by
the
fee
owner.
you
see,
we
only
--
if
you
look
back
at
that
little
tract,
we
only
own
up
to
321.
and
we
couldn't
validly
claim
that
we
won
title
to
damages
either
for
the
land
taken
or
damages
to
the
residue
as
to
the
black
shaded
area
which
incidentally
was
on
the
bluff
of
the
--
of
the
land.
we
couldn't
validly
claim
that.
in
other
words,
we
did
not
have,
as
far
as
land
area
is
concerned,
rights
coextensive
with
what
the
government
was
taking.
do
i
make
myself
clear?
so
--
and
the
government
didn't
described
it.
you
see,
the
government
in
its
complaint
in
this
case,
they
described
their
easement.
they
said
nothing
about
vepco's
easement
which,
of
course,
they
did
--
they
didn't
have
--
didn't
have
to
do.
but
they
--
in
other
words,
they
did
not
condemn
vepco's
easement
and
they
didn't
want
to
condemn
vepco's
easement
because
at
that
time,
the
government
was
taking
the
position
that
your
easement
is
more
onerous
than
ours
because
we
are
only
going
to
flood
the
land
intermittently.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
without
any
compensation.
that's
their
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
that's
their
position.
that's
right.
and
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
and
maybe
that
justify
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
well,
that's
their
claim,
sir.
but
we
dispute
that
because
we
say
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
go
further
than
the
banks
of
the
stream
and
you
cannot
destroy
property
rights
and
increase
in
land
as
distinguished
from
water
power.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
all
the
cases
support
us
on
that
position
that
when
they
become
--
this
raise
or
carve
this
flowage
easement
out
of
the
land
which
is
--
which
is
--
includes
ours
over
which
we
have
the
same
or
similar
rights,
it
extinguishes.
it
extinguishes
our
rights
and
extinguish
money
as
their
taking.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
let's
put
it
this
way,
that
mrs.
williams,
on
the
day
of
the
taking,
could
not
convey
the
right
to
the
government
to
flood
the
land
up
to
contour
321.
that
would
have
been
in
derogation
of
the
grant
but
as
this
--
this
was
covenant
of
title,
you
--
we
had
all
of
the
covenants
of
title
and
that
in
it
was
a
valid
and
existing
easement
and
--
and
they
do
argue
that
in
their
brief
that
they
--
that
she
could've.
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
there
isn't
a
lot
of
support
that
it
would
then
a
valid
conveyance
and
incidentally
the
letter
that
he
read
from
a
moment
ago
as
to
the
offer
by
the
fee
owner,
the
offer
said,
"we
will
convey
you
the
rights
above
the
contour
318,"
of
course,
it
was
stipulated
later,
it
was
the
321.
in
other
words,
she
consider
that
vepco
had
the
right
and
incidentally,
the
government
represented
to
the
fee
owner
and
to
her
attorney
that
they
were
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
going
to
acquire
those
rights
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
to
flood
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
they
were
going
to
acquire
the
right
to
flood
from
vepco
by
separate
negotiations.
and
we
have
it
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
what
they
argue
now.
but
in
the
exhibit
h,
which
is
in
our
brief
in
which
they
don't
refer
to,
which
the
correspondents
between
the
corps
of
engineers,
they
said
in
that
--
under
this
option
agreement,
we
can't
get
all
of
the
things
that
we
wanted.
we've
got
to
get
it
from
vepco.
now,
they've
changed
their
mind
and
say
that,
"well,
this
is
something
hanging
up
here
in
the
air
and
we
just
don't
have
to
bother
with
you.
we
don't
have
to
--
we
don't
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
have
to
negotiate
with
you."
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
they
--
they
took
that
position
for
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
before
twin
city.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
what?
as
to
agreeing
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
paralleled
their
position
in
twin
city.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
and
the
best
answer
that
i
can
give
to
that
is
the
subsequent
history
of
twin
city.
because
in
the
twin
city
case,
there
were
189
acres
of
flowage
acres
in
that
case
and
when
it
went
back
from
this
court
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
agreed
with
the
government
and
said,
"as
to
those
flowage
acres,
you
don't
have
to
value
it
without,
you
know,
excluding
water
power
value."
it
went
up
to
the
fourth
circuit
and
again
the
fourth
circuit,
for
the
fourth
time,
counting
that
--
last
time
here
when
judge
(inaudible)
wrote
it
but
while
chief
judge
parker
was
that
said,
"no,
that
--
this
--
the
twin
city
decision
only
involved
the
plus
factor."
and
it
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
doesn't
include
any
other
value.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
the
plus
factor
of
water
power
value.
that
was
about
five
times
what
the
value
would've
been
under
ordinary
circumstances.
and
incidentally,
i'd
like
to
straighten
the
record
in
this
case.
we
have
not
changed
our
position
even
before
twin
city.
we
didn't
claim
water
power
value.
he
read
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
interrogatory
but
we
disclaimed
it.
and
we've
said
it
time
and
time
again
even
before
the
first
trial
and
we've
never
asked
for
it
in
a
hearing
for
valuation.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
way
this
case
on
the
pleadings,
and
if
you
will
forget
the
different
interests
in
this
case
was
a
garden-variety
condemnation
case.
the
government
calls
out
this
easement,
brings
the
condemnation
case
against
the
land,
against
all
the
world
regardless
of
interest
in
the
land
and
say,
"we
want
to
value
the
compensation
for
this
easement."
and
that
--
and
when
you
do
that,
as
mr.
morton
said,
"you
value
the
land
before
and
after
the
taking
of
the
easement,
which
includes
any
so-called
damages
to
the
residue
and
you
exclude
water
power
value."
and
that
was
exactly
what
was
done
in
this
case
on
the
second
trial
when
you
got
the
$70,000
award.
then
the
next
step
is,
well
--
and
that's
against
all
the
world.
they
had
a
fair
trial,
that's
just
compensation.
water
power
value
hasn't
been
considered
and
that
is
what
they
would
pay
and
did
pay
in
companion
cases
that
are
reported
right
next
to
this
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
case.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
alright.
then
you
get
down
to
the
division
of
that
$70,000,
i
forget
the
$100,
as
between
the
different
owners.
and
incidentally,
my
adversary
says
the
unit
rule
on
that
is
where
you
condemn
irrespective
of
the
--
of
the
division
in
title
applies
in
the
usual
case,
and
that's
true.
they
--
mr.
augelle
in
his
work
talks
about
the
undivided
fee
rule
even
though
you
got
a
diversity
of
interest.
you
go
ahead
and
forget
that
as
a
practical
matter
and
you
value
the
--
the
raise
as
if
it
was
not
divided.
and
he
says
in
most
cases,
that's
the
same.
and
the
exception
to
the
rule
is
where
it's
so
divided
that
the
sum
of
the
parts,
either
greatly
exceed
the
award
for
getting
the
division
of
the
parts
as
of,
you
know,
the
one
undivided
tract
or
the
sum
of
the
parts
of
so
much
less,
then
an
injustice
would
result
and
then
you
do
not
apply
the
undivided
fee
rule
in
determining
the
--
the
compensation.
but
in
this
case,
not
only
of
--
is
a
boston
case
not
applicable,
but
because
of
the
facts
involved
in
that
case,
but
in
this
case
the
government
argues
itself
that
all
--
that
--
that
some
of
the
parts
is
equal
to
the
fee
because
in
their
brief
they
said
the
whole
fee
value,
the
full
value
still
stayed
in
the
fee
owner
and
all
that
was
owned
it
was
a
little
blemish
and
that
is
this
unexercised
flowage
easement.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
cloud
on
the
title.
so
even
by
their
own
admission,
this
undivided
fee
rule
is
the
standard
for
the
valuation
of
a
--
of
an
interest
in
land,
the
raise
of
the
government's
easement
as
applied
in
this
case.
now,
you
get
down
to
the
apportionment.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
they
got
together
and
made
a
contract.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
in
--
in
the
boston
case,
they
were
valuing
the
--
the
dominant
tenement.
the
ones
to
--
in
whose
favor
the
easement
still
(inaudible)
land
with
the
ones
and
said,
"if
we'll
all
get
together,
the
--
the
damages
and
so
on
and
so
forth
are
$60,000.
but
there,
the
taking
of
this
land
was
by
the
city
to
change
a
private
way
or
street
to
a
public
street.
and
as
a
result,
as
a
factual
the
matter,
there
was
no
interference
with
the
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
interference
and
the
fee
owner
couldn't
grant
it
and
how
in
the
world
can
the
government
condemn
something
out
of
thin
air?
and
say
it
--
it
gets
it
out
of
the
land
and
--
and
you
--
you
don't
have
any
interest
in
that
land
is
--
is
absurd
to
me.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
the
award
was
verified
and
the
award
should
have
been
$70,000
because
they
excluded
all
water
power
value
and
just
valued
it
before
and
after
of
agriculture
grazing
in
timberland.
and
they
said
that
the
difference
between
those
values
was
70,000
some
hundred
dollars.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
she
gets
the
difference
in
the
value
of
the
servient
land
before
and
after
the
taking
of
the
easement
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
considering
all
the
purposes
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
oh,
in
fee?
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
a
fee
taking.
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
they
take
the
whole
fee
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
then
she
would
get
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
fee
values
plus
(inaudible)
excluding
water
power
purpose.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no.
that
would
--
that
would
be
improper
too.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that
would
--
that
would
be
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
why
--
why
certainly
we
could
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
proved
it.
they
say
we
never
brought
a
buy
in
but
you
don't
have
to
bring
the
--
the
live
in
buyer.
there's
a
hypothetical
assumptions
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
and
all
i
get
--
but
we
have
evidence
in
this
case
before
1944.
they
had
gone
out
and
--
and
made
economic
study
of
this
site.
and
that
there
were
other
--
i've
forgotten
how
many
companies,
18
of
companies
in
this
particular
area
and
--
and
there
was
a
demand
for
flowage
easements
and
--
and
sites
in
this
--
in
this
general
area.
as
much
as
a
market
as
you
can
find
in
things
of
this
kind,
which
i
must
admit
somewhat
unique.
but
the
evidence
in
this
case
does
show
that.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
we
don't
want
the
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
i
don't
have
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
there
is
no
doubt
they're
not
because
you
see,
she
has
not
conveyed
the
fee
and
she
has
not
conveyed
them
of
that
amount
and
we
are
just
asking
for
a
part
of
it
and
incidentally,
the
fee
owner
from
the
very
outset,
has
recognized
that
the
virginia
electric
&
power
company
has
the
right.
they
were
extent,
they
were
existing,
there
hadn't
been
abandonment,
there
was
no
abandonment
through
non-use
and
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
compensation.
she's
always
taking
that
position.
in
other
words,
she
recognized
the
--
the
legal
situation
that
she
was
in.
and
incidentally,
the
government
hadn't
decided
to
take
a
fee
in
the
case
as
we
--
we've
brought
out.
in
other
words,
that
wasn't
the
consideration
there.
we
proved
it
by
evidence
and
how
you
can
say
it
now
is
--
is
contrary
to
the
evidence
in
the
case.
but
in
other
words,
what
happened
was
that
the
fee
owner
said,
"i
understand
you
want
additional
rights.
don't
take
anything
with
a
flowage
easement
because
you
don't
see
how
this
thing
does
go
up
in
the
land
if
you
took
the
fee.
there
would
be
the
severance
damage
although
damages
would
be
so
much
more
because
you'd
be
cutting
off
access
while
you
wouldn't
cut
it
off
with
the
--
with
the
--
with
an
easement.
and
if
you'll
do
that,
i'll
give
you
the
additional
rights
for
a
nominal
sum."
and
the
government
says,
"that's
just
fine.
we
will
--
we
will
negotiate,"
and
she
says,
"and
the
latter,
we
will
negotiate
with
vepco
for
its
rights
and
then
it
never
negotiates
and
brings
this
condemnation
proceeding."
now,
to
answer
the
damage
to
the
residue,
i
--
i
don't
want
to
dodge
that
question
because
the
court
below
answered
it
very
clearly.
after
you
have
--
by
the
undivided
fee
rule
determine
by
--
for
the
garden-variety
condemnation
proceeding,
the
just
compensation
for
the
--
for
the
government's
flowage
easement,
you
get
down
to
an
apportionment
of
the
--
of
the
--
of
that
sum,
of
the
$70,000
sum
in
proportion
to
the
interest
involved
in
the
case
or
in
the
--
that
have
been
destroyed
and
that
are
affected
by
the
taking.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
only
such
are
being
taken.
and
that's
why
we
had
the
second
inquiry
to
the
commissioners
in
the
case.
now,
the
second
inquiry
only
involved
the
right
up
to
321
and
it
said,
"what
would
have
been
the
damages
if
you
--
the
government's
easement
had
only
covered
up
to
321,"
the
before
and
after
value.
and
incidentally,
it
wasn't
the
--
the
fourth
circuit's
brainchild
after
the
remand
from
this
case.
the
government
had
argued
on
the
first
trial
that
if
we
have
to
pay,
you
valued
it
improperly
by
taking
the
fee
value
because
we
have
this
permanent
flowage
you
see
to
overflow
the
land
permanently
because
we
are
not
taking
that
right.
we're
taking
less
than
that
so
please
only
value
our
easement.
well,
we
argued
when
we
got
back
to
the
fourth
circuit
that
since
we
hadn't
got
any
water
power
value,
the
first
go
around
just
please
affirm
the
judgment.
but
the
court
then
agreed
with
the
government
and
said,
"oh
no,
the
government
isn't
taking
as
much
as
you
have
and
it's
not
damaging
the
land
as
much
as
you
would
damage
the
land,
so
we're
going
to
send
it
back
and
tried
on
that
basis."
so
you
see,
when
you
are
valuing
the
land
as
coextensive
with
our
easement,
the
before
and
after
value
naturally
includes
damages
to
the
residue.
you
see.
because
it's
not
for
the
--
it's
--
it's
not
submitted
to
on
what's
the
compensation
for
the
land
taken
plus
the
damages
to
the
residue.
before
and
after
includes
both
because
at
that
particular
time,
the
government
was
claiming
not
only
--
it
was
claiming
that
there
were
great
benefits
that
would
result
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
we
owned
the
easement.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
we
got
a
portion
of
the
damages
to
the
residue
which
is
attributable
to
the
easement
that
we
had
that
include
it,
as
i
read
on
page
8,
the
damages
to
the
residue
and
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
that
out.
in
other
words,
you
are
valuing
our
easement
and
our
easement
covered
two
things.
it
covered
compensation
for
the
land
that
we
took
directly
and
it
also
took
any
damages
cost
to
the
residue
as
was
pointed
out
on
the
top
--
the
bottom
of
page
7
and
the
top
of
page
8.
so,
in
trying
to
find
out
what
was
our
proportionate
part
of
the
award,
the
same
standard
or
the
same
rule
was
--
was
applied.
in
other
words,
damages
to
the
residue
were
part
of
our
acquisition
cost.
now,
i'll
agree
that
--
that
reproduction
cost
only
applies
to
improvements
and
things
of
that
nature.
but
the
net
effect
of
it,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
what
the
court
and
what
was
done
below,
by
the
courts
below
was
to
take
a
reproduction
cost
attitude
toward
the
determination
or
in
the
determination
of
the
award
to
be
made
to
the
power
company
for
its
proportionate
part
of
the
condemnation
award.
now,
there's
one
other
thing
here
that
i
bound
to
reply
to.
he
said
some
about
--
it's
none
of
our
business
as
to
what
happened
between
vepco
--
what
happened
between
the
government
and
the
fee
owner.
well,
of
course,
it's
not
about
business
except
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
--
what
she
did
convey
to
him
and
when
he
says
we
got
something
from
the
fee
owner,
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
didn't
get
it
under
the
option
agreement.
your
counsel
said
nothing
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
you
got
nothing
from
it.
and
i
will
go
or
even
further
with
the
government
and
say
by
virtue
that
option
agreement,
she
didn't
increase
anyone's
right
and
by
the
same
token,
she
didn't
decrease
anyone's
rights.
and
the
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
they
--
they
--
which
would
have
been
--
i've
forgotten,
$5000
or
$6000
under
the
formula
or
the
--
the
full
compensation
for
the
government's
easement
without
any
consideration
of
anything
else.
that's
right.
and
the
fourth
circuit
said,
"that's
good
enough
for
her.
she
didn't
get
that
amount
but
we
want
to
do
what's
--
what's
right
by
the
owner
of
this
--
of
this
easement
that's
valid
and
existing
as
of
the
time
of
the
taking."
so
it
really
gives
a
reproduction
or
replacement
cost
figured
as
of
the
time
of
the
taking
and
leaving
out
the
difference
in
the
onerousness,
it's
not
a
good
word,
but
in
the
burden
of
the
--
of
the
easement
that
we
had
as
contrasted
with
the
lighthearted
easement
which
the
government
claimed
at
one
time
it
was
taking.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
value.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
that's
our
position.
and
we
say
that
it
didn't
--
the
kansas
city
case
that
he
virtuously
aside
and
the
fourth
circuit
relied
on
that
in
the
cress
case
and
one
other
case
that
we
didn't
cite
because
it
doesn't
say
so
but
the
net
result
to
that
holding
is
that
--
is
certainly
in
support
of
our
case
and
that's
this
united
states
against
chicago,
milwaukee,
st.
paul
case
in
312
u.s.,
which
unfortunately
it's
not
cited
in
--
in
either
brief.
but
there,
if
you
did
have
the
mississippi
river
definitely
a
navigable
stream
and
a
dam
that
it
in
the
exercise
of
the
paramount
navigation
servitude
and
the
--
and
the
government
condemned
against
the
railroad
company,
a
long
stretch
of
railroad
right
away.
and
some
--
there
were
four
segments
in
that
case
that
there
was
some
controversy
about
as
to
whether
it
was
within
under
high-water
mark
in
the
--
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
therefore,
subject
to
the
--
to
the
government's
paramount
navigation
servitude.
and
the
government
admitted
in
that
case
and
the
rest
of
it
where
they
made
compensation,
i
do
not
how
much
but
anyway,
they
paid
compensation
for
that
taking.
and
then
as
to
the
four,
when
you
reverse
it
and
sent
it
back,
you
said,
it'd
be
just
a
question
of
fact
that
any
of
the
easements
that
were
above
high-water
mark,
they
were
entitled
to
compensation
for
the
extra
riprapping
that
they
had
to
do
in
order
to
keep
the
--
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
river
that
have
been
pushed
up
on
the
land
by
this
navigation
dam
offer
of
the
railroad
right
away.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
if
you're
going
to
say
it
is
a
privilege
to
flow,
then
i'd
have
to
agree
with
you
but
that's
not
what
we
had.
we
had
a
privilege
to
overflow
riparian
uplands
from
a
navigable
stream.
now,
it's
true
we
didn't
have
a
license
but
our
privilege
is
not
pertinent
and
it
was
not
tied
in
to
the
granting
of
a
license.
in
fact,
you
read
the
grant
to
--
to
the
power
company,
our
predecessor
entitle
and
it's
not
as
the
government
brief
claims
and
that
it
was
conditional,
contingent
and
so
on
and
so
forth
that
it
did
--
it
doesn't
say
that
at
all.
in
other
words,
you
had
to
have
two
things
in
this
case
in
order
to
overflow
the
land.
you
had
to
have
a
privilege
from
the
fee
owner
to
flood
the
fee
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
owner's
land
and
you
also
had
to
have
a
dam
to
put
the
water
up
there
to
exercise
that
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
and
you
had
to
come
to
washington,
the
federal
power
commission
to
get
that
but
we
--
if
we
had
put,
say,
to
get
a
license
ahead
of
the
flowage
easement,
it
wouldn't
have
cost
us
--
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
have
had
any
bearing
by
getting
the
license
in
washington,
we
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
flood.
and
the
water
power
act
clearly
recognizes
that
--
that
interest
in
land
and
compensation
for
damage
and
interest
in
land
after
you
get
a
license
while
you
--
you
got
to
pay
for
it.
so
we
say
you
had
to
get
two
things
and
that's
--
that's
an
important
dichotomy
there
and
the
--
the
fourth
circuit
recognized
that
on
several
occasions
and
--
and
really
said
to
the
government,
"you
don't
recognize
that
right
and
just
because
you
got
to
have
a
license
doesn't
mean
that
you
--
you
have
a
right
to
flood
the
land.
you've
got
to
get
it
some
--
from
someone."
and
this
respondent,
the
power
company
had
it
and
you
could
have
gotten
it
from
them
but
you
chose
not
to
and
you
can't
do
it
out
of
it
and
that
brings
me
to
this
point.
following
it
to
the
logical
conclusion,
there's
a
windfall
somewhere.
let's
suppose
the
--
the
fee
owner
in
1925
or
in
1942
when
they
got
the
deed
of
correction,
got
$10,000
for
the
easement
to
flood
a
land,
which,
of
course,
is
very
nominal
considering
what's
happened
in
this
case.
alright,
in
1944,
they
approved
--
congress
approves
the
buggs
island
project
and
what
happened
in
this
case
comes
along
and
they
say,
"well,
we
are
not
going
to
--
we're
not
going
to
pay
you,"
who
owns
the
--
the
easement,
"(inaudible)
which
you
pay
$10,000.
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
anything."
all
the
rights,
and
--
and
paraphrasing
what
they
say
now,
all
the
rights
are
in
the
fee
owner.
and
they
don't
say
the
fee
owner's
rights
have
diminished,
they
say
they
increased.
that's
what
the
government
says.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
they
say
they
increase.
yes,
sir.
they
said
they
had
the
full
fee
value.
and
they
say
if
we
pay
the
$50,000
and
this
thing
wouldn't
be
up
--
be
up
here,
they
said
if
the
full
fee
value.
now,
in
that
case,
she
would
have
been
entitled
to
just
compensation
and
if
she
had
wanted
to
make
the
agreement
and
you
have
to
suppose
that
to
get
to
the
truth
whether
the
thing
is
really
just
or
not,
just
compensation
with
the
fact
that
ours
is
only
a
cloud
on
the
title,
she'd
be
entitled
to
let's
say
$10,000.
she
would
have
already
gotten
$10,000
for
it.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
for
a
consideration.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
when
you
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
the
government's
condemned
only
a
right
to
flow
and
let's
--
if
your
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
case
--
let's
suppose
it
just
adds
up
to
321,
both
of
them
are
coextensive
because
otherwise,
i'll
have
to
dodge
your
answer
because
the
--
the
easement
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
rights
are
not
for
terminate.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
alright,
sir.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
because
i
had
the
legal
right
and
it's
a
--
an
easement
and
gross
and
it
had
value
as
such.
and
all
the
cases
of
brooklyn
terminal
case
and
all
--
i
can't
that
say
that
easement
and
gross
that
it
wasn't
a
nuisance
value,
i
had
a
value
before
this
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
i
have
a
property
right
and
if
i
have
an
easement
and
even
though
it's
an
easement
of
way
and
i
have
two
easements
of
way
and
you
come
and
put
a
three
(inaudible)
well,
i
haven't
got
a
snip
there
or
let
the
other
man
who
--
who
blocks
the
way
and
say,
"oh,
that
one
when
he
used
to
you,"
if
--
if
the
man
--
if
the
easement
of
way
had
value.
in
other
words,
it
has
a
transferrable
value
and
--
and
to
say
that
well
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
the
market
--
the
market
was
closed.
the
market
was
closed.
the
only
--
the
only
possible
purchaser
would
have
been
the
united
states
but
we
haven't
ask
that
in
this
market
where
the
purchaser,
the
united
states,
that
it
--
any
added
--
anything
be
added
because
of
the
--
of
the
competition
of
the
government
and
what
you're
trying
to
do
here
to
say
that
otherwise
is
to
--
is
to
have
the
converse
of
the
doctrine
in
the
miller
case.
it
is
to
say
that
the
announcement
of
the
government's
plan
destroys
property
rights
and
property
values
without
compensation.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
now
--
well,
that
--
i
can't
go
along
with
you
there.
the
--
if
it's
a
water
right,
your
honor
is
exactly
right.
if
it
an
interest
in
land
above
the
bed
of
the
navigable
stream,
i
disagree
and
say
that
as
long
as
you
got
a
property
interest
and
a
property
right
above
the
high-water
mark
on
a
navigable
stream,
you're
entitled
to
compensation
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
when
it's
taken
all
damage.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
why
i
said
that
i
disagree
with
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
let
me
answer
that
with
two
--
in
two
respects
as
to
extinguish.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
the
announcement
of
the
government
construct
in
the
buggs
island
dam
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
extinguish
a
property
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
extinguish
a
market,
sir.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
it
extinguishes
availability.
now,
the
question
in
this
case
is
does
it
extinguish
the
money
value?
and
i
don't
think
--
well,
it
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
oh,
it
could
--
could
have
been
a
negotiated
matter
and
they
negotiated.
they
applied
a
lot
of
flowage
easements
over
the
use
of
properties
in
this
area.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes.
but
then,
the
--
the
government
can't
destroy
the
market.
and
then
from
that
say,
there
are
being
no
market,
you
and
i
are
entitled
to
any
compensation,
the
other
--
the
other
basis
for
--
for
determining
fair
value
or
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
they
--
they
destroyed
the
market
but
then
the
stock
and
standard
instruction
in
the
case
is
that
you
disregard
the
--
the
demands
of
the
government
although
the
government
must
have
it
and
that
--
and
so
on
with
a
hypothetical
willing
buyer
and
the
willing
seller
and
you
just
say
that
you
--
in
other
words
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well
then,
you
would
--
you
would
say
what
would
it
cost
someone,
supposing
a
buyer
not
the
government,
would
pay
for
a
flowage
easement
as
of
the
date
of
taking
of
flowage
to
this
nature.
and
of
course
then
we
get
back
to
what
mr.
morton
admits
is
the
--
is
the
true
rule.
it's
--
it's
the
difference
in
the
value
of
the
servient
tenement.
in
other
words,
we
get
back
to
--
we
didn't
have
a
right
to
--
to
grow
temper,
we
didn't
have
a
right
to
form
it
but
the
value
of
our
easement,
which
was
curved
out
of
it,
is
--
is
measured
by
the
difference
in
value
of
the
servient
state
before
and
after
the
taking.
and
--
and
that's
what
was
applied
on
the
second
inquiry
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
but
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
as
a
part
of
that,
the
thing
--
you
still
don't
apply
different
rules
of
--
of
valuation.
in
other
words,
it
would
be
utterly
wrong
if
we
say
no
double
standard
of
valuation
if
in
this
in
rem
proceeding
against
this
land
has
no
--
in
rem
proceeding
against
this
land
with
no
regard
to
the
division
and
ownerships,
then
you
pay
the
difference
in
the
value
before
and
after
the
taking.
alright.
and
in
the
dunnington
case
and
in
the
docket
case,
the
court
said,
and
mr.
justice
holmes
incidentally
wrote
docket
--
no,
he
barely
wrote
--
no
he
didn't
write
dunnington
but
he
wrote
docket
case,
he
said
to
you
--
if
you
get
a
new
title
and
--
and
the
--
the
government
pays
for
what
it
took
and
then
it's
no
business
of
the
government
as
to
how
you
divide
it
later
on.
he's
in
one
of
the
cases
because
that's
for
the
district
court
to
decide
as
to
the
apportionment
of
it.
the
government
is
nowhere
solved,
they've
been
treated
exactly
right
and
that's
what
was
done
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
no.
and
if
--
if
that
were
true,
then
we
would
have
to
apply
the
standard
first
used
in
the
district
court
which
was
that
we
limited
it
to
the
1540
acres
and
we
said
you
have
the
flowage
easement
and
its
perpetual
permanent
and
that's
really
the
equivalent
of
the
fee
value.
and
you
didn't
have
any
damages
to
the
residue
and
that
determination.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
the
government
said
that's
the
wrong
way
to
do
it.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
the
lady
had
sold
to
the
government.
she
did
in
some
of
these
cases
and
we
divide
it
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
we
would
--
we
would
have
divided
with
this
particular
lady
as
we
did
in
some
cases,
we
had
divided
the
compensation.
we
have
apportionment
them
by
agreement
of
the
concession.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
i
doubt
it.
according
to
exhibit
h
in
this
case,
they
said
that
they
weren't
going
to
take
it
unless
vepco
joined
in
the
conveyance.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
legally
speaking,
if
they
take
and
they
still
wouldn't
have
that
right
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--because
the
fee
owner
didn't
have
the
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
we
would
--
had
a
case
under
the
tucker
act,
i
think,
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
against
the
united
states
government
for
the
damage
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
sir.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
sir.
because
you
see,
by
the
purchaser
of
the
fee,
it
was
subject
--
that's
an
underlying
fee.
she
didn't
have
the
full
fee
value.
and
she
didn't
have
all
of
the
rights
that
government
needed
and
that
was
--
that's
why
they
didn't
take
--
didn't
exercise
option
contract
in
this
case.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
because
there
would
have
been
an
extinguishment
or
taking
or
damage
of
easement.
yes.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
in
that
case
though
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
but
in
the
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
but
in
the
boston
case,
they
got
$5000
for
that
easement
of
way.
and
it
was
a
--
the
difference
between
the
$5000
and
the
$60,000
had
to
do
with
the
negative
easements
of
light
and
air.
and
you
see
--
so
when
you
apply
that
analogy,
the
boston
case,
as
i
view
it,
is
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
sir?
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
you
see
--
no,
no.
you
see,
they're
taking
the
--
their
way
in
and
out
in
the
boston
case
that
they
had
taken
the
--
the
access
and
light
easements
of
access
light
and
air.
then
i
think
it
would
have
been
an
entirely
different
decision
in
the
case.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
i
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no.
i
--
i
--
it's
been
sometime.
i
have
checked
it
in
the
last
week
but
my
recollection
was
that
the
--
the
$55,000
had
to
do
with
the
--
with
the
other
easements
but
it
is
true
as
mr.
augelle
(ph)
said
that
and
as
mr.
morton
has
said.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
because,
you
see,
they
made
this
contract
and
really
what
the
court
held
is
that
you
can't
--
you
can't
treat
the
condemnor
that
way.
you
can't,
by
agreement,
enhance
his
damages.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes.
but
they
were
trying
--
they
were
trying
by
agreement
to
get
this
undefined
fee
rule
and
say
that
there
wasn't
any
real
difference
between
the
sum
of
interest
and
the
--
and
the
full
fee
value,
you
see.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
city
was
taking
a
private
way
and
making
it
a
public
street
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
but
if
it
had
been
a
railroad
and
oh,
there's
--
it's
got
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
if
it
--
i
would
think
so
because
you
got
access
light
and
air
and
that's
the
worst
place
to
be
on
railroad
for
easements
of
that
kind
and
as
the
roberts
case
and
new
york
shows.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no.
aren't
you
saying,
sir,
that
they
are
taking
a
private
flowage
easement
and
tying
it
in
to
a
public
flowage
easement?
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
in
that
--
in
that
case
then
you've
got
to
pay
fair
value
for
the
--
for
that
private
flowage
easements
that's
been
taken
in
that
case
and
the
best
way
to
do
is
to
--
is
to
determine
it
on
the
before
and
after
value
of
the
servient
land
rather
than
measuring
it
as
they
would
have
it
here
by
a
use
factor
and
that's
never
done.
you
get
into
how
valuable
is
the
use
of
it
and
--
and
we'll
be
right
in
the
middle
of
twin
city's
case.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
and
of
course,
that's
where
they
want
to
force
us.
they
want
to
push
us
into
the
water
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
and
we
want
to
stay
up
on
the
dry
land.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
but
i
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
but
you've
lost
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
but
the
owners
lost
and
not
what
the
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
and
not
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
but
it
meant
something
to
us.
and
--
and
one
just
stop
in
college
either.
and
--
and
we
have
had
a
transferrable
value.
and
it
was
an
easement
in
gross
and
we
--we
ask
up
until
1944.
i
had
a
chance
to
do
it
and
it
was
being
traded
around
for
fair
value.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
well,
it
had
a
transferrable
value
to
--
to
the
united
states
and
i
hate
to
think
it
wouldn't
because
then
if
the
united
states
had
negotiated
with
us
and
paid
us
part,
we
would
--
we
would
have
been
getting
a
whole
lot
value
and
i
there
say
that,
on
the
state
of
the
record
in
this
case,
the
united
states
could
have
gotten
that
easement
from
us
and
assuming
as
we
did
over
here
that
only
had
the
flow
up
to
contour
321,
it
could
have
gotten
everything
it
wanted
from
us
and
it
--
it
didn't
even
have
to
say
(inaudible)
to
mrs.
williams.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
no.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
it
rendered
inoperable,
yes,
sir,
but
it
didn't
render
it
--
it
didn't
render
it
valueless
or
worthless.
it
was
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
still
there.
and
--
and
once
you
decide
though
that
compensation
must
be
paid,
i
submit
that
really,
under
the
docket
and
the
dunnington
case,
it's
really
none
of
the
government's
business
on
this
record
as
to
how
the
--
how
the
award
was
split
between
the
fee
owner
and
the
--
and
the
power
company
that
own
the
flowage
easement.
and
--
and
the
cases,
i
think,
bear
out
that
statement
with
all
due
deference
to
--
to
their
position.
and
what
they're
really
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
pamper
the
rights
of
mrs.
williams
even
though
they
don't
stand
in
her
shoes
and
i'm
not
claiming
under
it.
and
to
diminish
and
--
and
run
down
the
rights
that
we
have
that
were
perfectly
valid,
they
were
perfectly
--
they
were
existing
and
which
would
have
been
very
--
would
have
done
the
job
as
far
as
contour
321
is
concerned
if
they
had
obtained
them
by
negotiation
or
purchase
from
us.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
not
--
well
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
through
the
exercise
of
the
easement,
yes.
but
in
ours
that
i've
quoted
from
page
608,
they
--
there
was
a
full
release
from
damage.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
so
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
--
so
in
other
words,
our
easement
included
not
only
for
the
land
after
321
but
for
the
damages
to
the
residue
which
would
result
from
the
exercise
of
that
easement.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
and
that
had
also
been
granted
to
us
so
i
say
that
when
you
are
valuing
what
we
had,
you
don't
just
value
part
of
it,
you
value
the
whole
bundle
of
rights
which
included
the
damages
to
the
residue
so
the
similarity
is
right
there.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
the
evidence
in
this
case
by
her
own
attorney
and
his
letters
is
that
she
offered
and
said,
"if
you
will
take
the
flowage
easement,
vepco's
got
all
the
right
below
321."
she
used
the
word
"318"
or
the
attorney
did
because
he
didn't
know
any
part
at
the
time.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
and
if
you
will
do
that,
i
will
be
glad
to
convey
to
you
what
i
have
additional
rights
for
$1.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
she
has
--
own
--
own
that
little
chart
of
mine.
she
had
the
land
unencumbered
fee
title
to
the
land
you
see
that's
shaded
which
is
--
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
that's
300
acres
in
there.
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
appear
to
be
300
acres
is
because
it's
on
a
block
and
this
is
a
contour
map.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
because
in
--
well,
they
haven't
obtained
anything
really
from
her.
they
obtained
everything
they've
got
in
this
condemnation
proceeding.
the
option
agreement
was
never
settled.
and
she
was
a
party
to
the
agreement
and
she's
still
a
party
to
the
agreement,
a
party
to
the
condemnation
case,
i'm
sorry.
and
a
final
order
hadn't
been
entered
as
to
her.
she's
still
sitting
in
--
down
there
waiting
for
her
dollar.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
the
additional
rights
to
the
government
for
$1,
the
additional
flowage
rights.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
the
300
acres,
that
nine
feet
between
the
contour
line.
it
--
because
she
said
she
didn't
want
the
fee
taken.
and
incidentally,
the
government,
while
they
say
that
was
a
policy
to
take
the
fee,
they
hadn't
made
that
determination.
they
haven't
clearly
shows
that
--
that
it
was
not
attacked.
in
other
words,
the
government
didn't
reduced
what
it
was
planning
to
take
because
of
this
--
of
this
offer.
there's
no
additional
compensation.
the
fourth
circuit
asked
the
government
numerous
times
where
was
the
additional
compensation
and
--
and
they
never
could
point
it
out
and
the
--
and
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
which
has
gone
into
this
thing
time
and
time
again
and
i
submit,
we
have
consistently
taken
the
position.
we
haven't
asked
for
and
we
haven't
been
awarded
water
power
value.
this
is
a
garden
variety
condemnation
case.
the
government
has
been
required
to
pay.
and
the
way
it
was
submitted
to
the
commissioners
only
what
it
would
had
to
pay
in
--
in
any
event.
and
it
--
it
ought
to
end
right
there.
but
if
you
go
any
further
into
the
matter,
the
apportionment
of
that
award,
which
is
on
a
sailboat,
in
our
judgment,
is
to
be
property
made
to
virginia
electric
&
power
company
for
his
outstanding
property
interest
existing
as
of
the
date
of
the
taking
in
which
was
always
there
and
which
we
hadn't
abandoned
and
which
was
not
contingent
upon
our
getting
of
license
to
build
the
dam.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
in
other
words,
is
--
the
dichotomy
there
and
the
fourth
circuit
says
you've
got
to
have
both
in
order
to
exercise
this
use
over
the
land.
but
because
you
got
control
or
you
don't
have
a
license,
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
don't
have
to
pay
to
get
--
to
get
the
right
to
overflow
the
land.
and
when
you
get
the
right
to
overflow
the
land,
the
conveyance
to
virginia
electric
&
power
company,
in
effect,
just
transferred
it
that
part
of
the
compensation,
if
we
said
it
was
all
coextensive
both
in
rights
and
in
the
area,
vepco
would
be
entitled
to
it.
excuse
me.
mr.
ralph
h.
ferrell,
jr.
thank
you
very
much.
