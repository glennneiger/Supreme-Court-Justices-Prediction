mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
appearing
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
employer
which
is
one
of
the
daily
newspapers
of
new
york,
which
for
a
number
of
years
has
had
collective
bargaining
agreements
with
the
union
represented
here
by
mr.
van
arkel,
a
local
of
the
international
typographical
union.
mr.
van
arkel
and
i
are
appreciative
of
the
court's
allowing
us
to
divide
the
argument
time
between
us,
since
sometimes
happens
in
the
case
of
labor
and
management
refinery
and
not
fully
in
agreement
with
each
other's
position
in
all
respects.
i
think,
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
point
out
as
a
starter,
some
of
the
points
of
difference
between
this
case
and
the
ones
which
have
preceded
it
and
the
one
which
follows
it.
in
the
first
case
which
your
honors
heard
yesterday,
the
hiring
hall
case,
it
was
made
quite
plain
that
in
that
kind
of
situation
where
alleged
discrimination
against
employees,
because
they
elect
union
membership
occurred,
took
place
off
the
employer's
premises
at
a
hiring
hall
represented
by
the
union.
we
have
no
such
question
as
that
here.
the
board
does
say
here
that,
in
effect,
this
operated
is
a
kind
of
de
facto
hiring
hall
because
the
union
--
the
foreman
who
actually
did
the
hiring
had
to
be
member
of
the
union.
but,
in
fact,
he
did
it
at
the
employer's
shop
and
as
the
proof
is
abundantly
clear,
many
of
the
employees
hired
were,
in
fact,
nonunion
men.
a
point
of
difference
between
this
case
and
the
one
which
immediately
preceded
it
is
that
in
that
case,
the
hiring
system
was
conceded
by
the
union
to
be
illegal,
as
i
understood
it.
and
the
union
therefore
is
attacked
on
the
whole
theory
of
the
mass
dues
reimbursement
order
which
the
court
had
directed
against
it.
again,
that
is
something
quite
different
from
our
case
where
there
is
anything
but
a
concession
that
the
actual
hiring
practices
were
illegal
and
in
fact,
until
this
court
rules
otherwise,
on
the
basis
of
existing
positions
by
the
courts
of
appeal.
it
appears
that
the
hiring
practices
were
quite
legal.
finally,
in
the
case
which
follows
us
in
which
mr.
van
arkel
would
represent
the
petitioner,
the
employer,
in
that
case,
was
the
--
was
the
charging
party
and
no
application
of
brown-olds
against
the
employer
was
involved
there.
now,
as
we
understand
the
argument
or
the
position
that
is
taken
by
the
board
here,
it
is
basically
that
this
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
is
one
applicable
to
a
local
of
the
international
typographical
union
and
to
all
of
the
new
york
city
newspapers,
in
effect,
constituted
a
per
se
violation
of
the
act
because
it
provided
for
a
closed-shop.
as
we
understand
it
further,
the
board
has
purported
to
go
farther
and
to
find
that
these
respondents,
both
the
union
and
employer,
maintained
and
enforced
an
illegal,
unlawful
union
security
system
and
a
preferential
hiring
practice.
as
members
of
the
court
have
already
observed
all
of
the
significant
findings
by
the
board,
have
been
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
what,
although
my
motives
maybe
suspect
i
say,
it's
an
unusually
well-written
and
recent
opinion
showing
very
careful
study
of
the
rather
complicated
record
--
facts
in
the
record
here.
as
we,
the
respondents,
stand
before
you
now,
we
thus
have
two
issues
to
present
to
the
court,
recognizing
that
the
board's
declination
of
our
invitation,
if
we
can
put
it
that
way,
to
argue
brown-olds
in
the
context
of
the
present
case,
is
understandable
and
must
presumably
be
accepted
by
us.
we
have,
nevertheless,
made
the
argument
in
our
brief
on
the
point
of
view
of
an
employer
who,
i
think,
has
an
even
stronger
story
to
tell
than
the
presentation
made
yesterday
on
behalf
of
the
union,
which
had
been
visited
with
the
brown-olds
remedy.
but
so
far
as
this
argument
is
concerned
and
in
order
not
to
foreclose
mr.
van
arkel
from
his
argument,
i
would
like
to
confine
myself
to
the
actual
mechanics
of
the
hiring
system
and
whether,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
law
took
place
and
whether
the
board
was
correct
in
finding
that
such
a
violation
took
place
or
conversely,
whether
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
found
that
the
system
was
perfectly
legal,
understandable
and
in
no
sense
operated
as
one
design
to
encourage
union
membership.
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
this
will
be
the
system,
mr.
justice,
as
it
actually
operated
as
found
by
the
--
as
found
by
the
court
of
appeals.
there
is
not
too
much
to
deal
with
the
operation
of
the
system
in
the
contract
itself.
there
was,
of
course,
many
relevant
provisions
dealing
with
seniority
and
things
like
that.
but
the
basic
problem
here
is,
as
--
as
we
understand
it
and
this
is
the
charge
with
which
we
have
been
confronted
for
nearly
five
years
now,
that
you
go
out
and
you
hire
people
to
work
in
the
mail-room
of
your
newspaper
and
if
you
have
two
people
in
front
of
you,
one
of
whom
has
a
union
card
and
one
of
whom
doesn't,
you
hire
the
union
cardholder
and
not
the
nonunion
man.
that
is
basically
the
charge
that's
made
against
us,
and
we
would
like
to
explain
why,
in
a
sense,
that
happens
to
be
true,
but
why
it
happens
to
be
true
and
why
we
think
it
leads
to
no
illegal
results.
in
the
operation
of
a
manufacturing
business,
which,
in
a
sense,
the
production
side
of
a
newspaper
is,
the
manpower
requirements
vary
very
considerably
from
one
day
to
the
next
on
a
quiet
night
when
the
papers
is
small
when
you
only
need,
perhaps,
50
men,
but
when
you
get
to
the
sunday
paper,
where
there
is
one
of
bigger
size
and
wider
circulation
and
you
perhaps
need
four
times
as
many.
now,
in
order
to
meet
the
shifting
demands
for
manpower,
a
system,
such
as
i
will
now
describe
you,
has
grown
up
over
the
years.
initially,
we
start
off
with
the
hardcore
or
calvary
of
individuals
who
work
each
night,
they
are
called
in
the
trade
regular
situation
holders.
they
are
the
persons
who
come
to
work,
go
to
the
locker
room,
change
their
clothes
and
report
immediately
for
work
without
having
to
see
the
foreman
first.
the
next
group
is
called
regular
substitutes.
now,
these
are
journeymen
also.
these
are
the
individuals
who
fill
in
for
the
absent
regular
situation
holders,
who
are
away
because
of
vacations
or
illness
or
the
like.
now,
everybody
in
these
first
two
groups,
the
record
shows
in
this
case,
is
a
member
of
the
mailers'
union,
which
is
not
too
surprising
considering
that
the
union
has
had
a
contract
with
the
new
york
city
newspaper
publishers
for,
i
suppose,
more
than
half
a
century.
now,
we
get
down
to
the
third
group
which
really
divides
into
two
classes,
and
these
are
the
people
who
are
known
as
?extras.?
and
for
the
most
part,
they
are
needed
on
friday
and
saturday
night
when
these
--
the
sunday
newspaper
is
being
produce.
there
are
two
types
really
of
extras.
the
first
extra
--
extras
are
the
men
who
come,
who
are
working
regularly
at
other
shops,
but
who
want
to
have
an
extra
shift
of
work
because
of
the
extra
income
involved
during
the
week.
so
consequently,
they
come
around
to
a
particular
newspaper,
let
us
say,
the
news,
and
as
a
result,
they
are
put
to
work
before
the
last
group
of
extras
who
are
known
as
the
nonunion
extras,
the
casuals,
a
term
descriptive
of
the
group
in
which
the
charging
party
in
the
case
now
before
your
honors
fell.
the
man
who
filed
the
charge
was
named
burton
randall.
his
livelihood
was
earned
in
the
fish
business
in
new
york
city.
he
worked
five
days
a
week
at
fulton
fish
market
starting
at
5
o'clock
in
the
morning.
but
for
a
number
of
years,
he
had
followed
the
policy
of
coming
around
to
the
daily
news
to
work
in
its
mail-room
on
friday
and
saturday
nights.
and
he
would
get
off
work
at
2
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
or
something
and
would
shape,
as
it
has
been
called,
which
means
to
apply
for
work
in
the
trade
regularly
on
those
nights.
now,
he
was
never
a
member
of
the
mailers'
union.
and
he
never
had
the
slightest
difficulty
for
many
years
in
obtaining
employment
on
those
nights.
when
--
in
1956,
the
mailers'
union,
the
other
respondent
here
inaugurated
a
further
program
of
modifying
its
traditional
hiring
practices
because
of
the
impact
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
so
forth.
and
came
forward
to
the
publishers
in
new
york
city
with
the
scheme
under
which
certain
of
the
men,
who
fell
in
this
last
group
of
nonunion
extras,
could
convert
themselves
and
be
promoted
to
regular
substitute
status,
that
being
the
highest
step
on
the
ladder
as
you
would
recall.
in
order
to
decide
who
of
the
nonunion
extra
group
would
be
eligible
to
apply
for
passing
the
competency
test
so
that
he
could
move
up
the
step,
the
arbitrary,
but
i
submit
entirely
reasonable
requirement
was
laid
down
that
the
individuals
who,
during
the
previous
year,
had
worked
an
average
of
not
less
than
three
shifts
per
week
would
be
eligible
to
take
the
examination.
now,
this
was
a
test
that
randall
couldn't
make.
randall
being
nothing
but
a
moonlighter
as
he
is
called,
working
--
working
weekends
was
not
able
to
take
the
competency
test
because
he
couldn't
meet
this
three-shift
requirement.
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
by
the
union
initially
with
the
agreement
of
the
employers.
the
employers
were
consulted
in
their
agreement
obtained
before
such
a
scheme
was
put
into
effect.
as
a
result
of
the
--
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
well,
i
believe
it's
both
written
and
practical,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i'm
not
entirely
sure,
but
there
is
a
method
described
in
the
record
by
which
the
individuals'
competency
is
determined,
that
is
they
--
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
well,
there
is
--
there
is
a
little
more
to
it
than
that.
i
--
i
wouldn't
want
to
concede
that
it
was
two
highly
skilled
a
job,
since
we
still
have
to
bargain
collectively
with
this
union
from
time
to
time.
but
i
would
--
i
would
honestly
concede
that
there
is
more
to
it
than
simply
tying
a
string
around
the
bundle
of
newspapers.
the
record
does
contain
evidence
of
the
type
of
the
examination
that
was
administered,
and
--
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
well,
most
of
that
is
done
by
machine,
but
not
all
of
it,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
and
i
can't
answer
question.
i'm
sorry,
i
just
don't
know
enough
about
the
mechanical
side
of
it.
in
any
event,
as
a
result
of
the
examination,
30
people
who
were
junior
to
randall
in
the
sense
that
they
had
been
working
for
many
years
at
the
news
--
been
working
for
less
years
at
the
news
than
randall
had,
were
moved
up
to
this
regular
substitute
status.
and
thereafter,
because
they
were
in
that
status
which
is
the
higher
rung
on
the
ladder
than
the
extras,
when
they
came
to
work,
they
were
hired
ahead
of
randall.
now,
coincident
--
coincidentally
with
that
move,
they
became
members
of
the
union.
now,
the
board
finds
very
sinister
motives
in
this
in
regard
to
this
a
highly
suspicious
circumstance,
but
i
submit
that
there
is
no
basis
for
that
because
the
union
as
part
of
this
arrangement
had
agreed
that
it
would
throw
open
its
membership
list
and
would
take
in
additional
members,
those
who
met
this
competency
availability
requirement.
those
persons
who,
having
shown
over
a
period
of
years
their
willingness
to
earn
their
primary
livelihood
at
this
trade
by
working
at
least
three
weeks,
were
found
--
three
shifts
a
week,
excuse
me,
were
found
acceptable
by
the
union
as
--
as
members,
and
the
fact
that
they
--
when
they
became
union
members,
they,
thereupon,
went
ahead
of
randall
in
hiring
is,
to
our
mind,
no
reflection
at
all
of
the
fact
that
randall
was
being
discriminated
against
because
he
was
not
a
union
member.
now,
basically,
that
is
the
--
the
factual
background
of
this
case
as
a
result
of
randall's
charge,
protracted
hearings
were
held
before
the
board,
extending
over
a
long
period
of
time,
as
besides
the
record
before
you
will
attest,
throughout
these
hearings.
well,
i
should
say
that
in
the
course
of
the
hearings,
it
soon
became
apparent
that
the
--
the
woes
of
mr.
randall
were
lost
in
sight
of
and
this
case
became
another
battleground
between
the
labor
board
and
the
international
typographical
union
with
the
employer
again
in
the
unhappy
position
of
being
an
unwilling
participant
in
the
(inaudible).
during
the
course
of
the
hearings,
general
counsel's
representative
made
what
we
have
always
regarded
to
be
a
very
significant
concession
in
this
case
in
terms
of
the
liability
thereafter
sought
to
be
imposed
upon
the
employer.
it
appears
at
page
129
of
the
record,
and
he
said,
may
i
state
for
the
record
that
we
don't
question
the
good
faith
of
the
parties
in
trying
to
deal
with
this
problem.
what
we
do
allege
here
is
that
the
conclusions
they've
reached
or
the
practice
that
resulted
and
the
contract
that
resulted,
unfortunately,
ran
afoul
of
the
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
now,
notwithstanding
that
concession,
notwithstanding
that
throughout
the
subsequent
proceedings
in
this
case,
no
claim
had,
at
any
time,
been
raised
that
some
liability
should
be
imposed
on
the
employer
in
terms
of
a
payment
of
back
pay,
union
dues,
initiation
fees
or
the
like.
the
board,
on
its
own
motion
in
the
--
as
a
result
of
inquiry
made
by
a
member
of
the
board
during
oral
argument
of
the
case,
nobody
having
said
a
word
about
brown-olds
that
your
honors
have
already
heard
how
this
brown-olds'
thunderbolt
was
forged
in
the
construction
and
trucking
industries
and
so
forth,
but
unfortunately
it
was
hurled
in
our
direction
without
the
slightest
warning
that
it
was
coming,
as
a
result
of
the
oral
argument
in
the
case,
we
find
ourselves
in
the
position
of
having
a
tale
added
by
the
board
to
the
order
recommended
by
its
trial
examiner,
in
which
the
employer
and
the
union
are
ordered
jointly
and
severally
to
reimburse
members,
all
employees
in
the
mail-room
for
dues
and
assessments
and
initiation
fees
paid
to
the
union
over
period
of
time,
which
extends
back
to
christmas
day,
1955
at
this
point.
this
is
a
relatively
small
unit.
they're
only
something
over
200
employees
involved,
but
our
potential
liability
under
that
order
at
this
moment
is
in
excess
of
$350,000.
i
would
close
--
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
all
--
all
employees
in
the
mail-room,
mr.
justice
black,
yes.
regardless
of
when
they
became
union
members
whether
it
was
long
before
taft-hartley
or
anything
like
that.
regardless
of
whether
the
individual
member
was
coerced
in
anyway,
there
is
no
proof
of
coercion.
we
have
instead
been
given
the
--
the
same
argument
of
inevitable
coercion.
in
order
not
to
preempt
mr.
van
arkel's
time
entirely,
i
would
just
like
to
close
by
noting
three
ironic
twists
to
this
case,
which
i
think
are
--
are
relevant
to
this
question
of
--
of
brown-olds
and
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
was
actual
discrimination
here.
if
instead
of,
as
the
board
says
we
did,
encouraging
union
membership,
we
had
discouraged
union
membership,
i
would
not
have
the
pleasure
of
standing
here
today
because
under
those
circumstances
all
that
happens
to
us,
if
we
send
the
foreman
out
to
tell
everybody
in
the
shop,
"this
union
is
no
good,
get
out
of
it,"
all
that
happens
to
us
is
that
we
get
hit
with
the
cease
and
desist
order,
which
we
can
live
with
and
in
fact
that
the
earlier
stage
of
this
case,
when
a
cease
and
desist
order
was
recommended
by
the
trial
examiner,
we
filed
no
exceptions
because
we
have
no
great
problem
with
that.
now,
our
--
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
well,
we
--
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
discouraging,
i
say,
yes,
because
the
normal
remedy
there
the
cease
and
desist
order
with
back
pay
for
discharged
employees.
in
my
hypothesis,
we
have
--
we
have
discharge
nobody,
we
have
simply
gone
around
and
said,
get
of
this
union.
nobody
is
--
mr.
john
r.
schoemer,
jr.
but
on
my
hypothesis,
nobody
got
out.
so,
it
causes
us
nothing.
you
see,
under
those
circumstances,
i
know
of
no
case
where
any
--
anymore
--
any
broader
remedy
than
the
payment
of
back
pay
to
discriminatorily
discharge
employees
has
been
ordered.
but
this
way,
you
see,
having
supposedly
by
the
board's
hypothesis
told
them
to,
come
on,
everybody
get
in
to
the
union,
we
are
ordered
to
pay
$350,000
that
we've
never
ever
seen,
it
never
even
been
passed
through
our
hands
to
a
check
off
scheme.
we've
never
had
anything
to
do
with
that
at
all.
if
this
is
not
a
fine,
i
really
can't
imagine
what
one
is.
there
are
other
circumstances
which
have
also
made
it
impossible
--
possible
for
us
to
avoid
the
unfortunate
situation
which
we
find
ourselves.
if,
for
example,
this
man
randall
had
decided
to
give
up
the
fish
business
and
go
into
the
newspaper
business,
we'd
have
no
problem
at
all.
he
wanted
to
join
the
union.
the
union
would've
taken
him
if
he
could've
met
the
required
number
of
shifts
requirement,
but
no,
he
decided
to
just
remain
a
weekend
worker
in
the
business.
finally,
if
the
international
typographical
union
which,
as
has
already
been
stated
here,
is
not
known
for
its
devotion
to
the
taft-hartley
act,
had
relented
in
its
opposition
and
had
met
the
filing
requirements
of
the
act
so
that
a
lawful
union
security
provision
under
section
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act,
could've
entered
into,
we'd
have
no
problem
here.
all
full-time
employees
within
30
days
after
employment
would
have
joined
the
union.
unfortunately,
none
of
these
came
about.
thank
you
very
much.
