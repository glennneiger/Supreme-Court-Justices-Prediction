of
the
record,
judge
hanks'
opinion,
he
--
he
says,
we
find
a
dirt
of
evidence,
either
the
union
journeyman
was
ever
hired
with
preference
to
a
nonunion
journeyman
or
that
the
qualifying
standards
for
the
examination
of
the
two
groups
are
different.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
quarrel
with
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
--
are
you
talking
about
the
potential
in
this
type
of
arrangement
for
discrimination?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
court
disagreed
on
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas

you,

your
brief,
point
out
instances
where
a
union
man
was
hired
in
preference
to
a
nonunion
man?
