justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
about
one
sentence
in
the
court's
opinion
below
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
or
not
it's
correct.
the
contract
was
made
nothing
which
on
its
face
which
has
said
the
violation
of
the
act,
the
general
counsel
so
conceded
with
the
juries
that
the
board
does
not
contend
otherwise.
justice

(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
i
don't
quite
understand.
is
this
correct
or
not
that
the
board's
general
counsel
conceived
that
there's
nothing
in
the
contract
on
its
face
which
can
be
violative
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
is
there
any
other
language
that
on
the
face
of
the
contract,
you
could
say
violated
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
can?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
they
could
utilize
it
as
a
vehicle
from
putting
over
a
closed-shop
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
the
facts
could
show
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us
--
i
don't
quite
--
are
you
asking
us
to
review
the
holding
of
the
court
that
the
record
is
varying
that
even
in
the
slightest
answer,
there
has
been
discrimination
in
the
conduct
of
these
examinations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
question
presented
as
it
must
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
still
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we're
not
asked
to
upset
what
the
court
found,
how
could
we
consider
and
in
connection
with
what
the
contract
--
whether
the
contract,
on
its
face,
is
vague?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
particular
facts
of
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
certainly
it
wouldn't
if
you
presented
it
as
a
question,
but
should
we
do
it
if
you
do
not
present
it
as
a
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
they
wanted
--
wanted
you
to
replenish
all
workers
in
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

why
does
that
distinction
appear
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
of
the
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
the
rule
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
have
this
liability
of
tax
to
you
if
your
offense
was
discouraging
