mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
the
labor
act
forbids
the
conditioning
of
employment
upon
union
membership.
an
employee
may
not
be
required
to
join
a
union
in
order
to
obtain
employment.
broadly
stated,
broadly
stated
the
question
in
this
case
that
threshold
question
in
this
case
is
whether
certain
contract
arrangements
between
the
respondent,
mailers'
union
and
various
newspaper
publishers
in
the
new
york
area
covering
the
employment
of
mail-room
employees
at
these
newspaper
publishers
whether
this
contract
arrangements
violates
the
closed-shop
ban
of
the
statute.
without
going
into
a
detail
for
the
moment,
the
contract
limits
employment
to
journeymen
and
apprentices.
it
does
not
have
any
specific
provision
that
membership
on
a
union
or
the
lack
of
it
is
a
condition
of
employment.
however,
the
contract
does
have
a
provision
which
provides
that
the
general
laws
of
the
international
typographical
union,
commonly
referred
to
as
the
itu,
which
is
the
parent
organization
of
the
respondent,
mailers'
union.
at
the
general
laws
of
the
itu
to
the
extent
that
they
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
specific
provisions
of
the
contract
and
are
not
in
conflict
with
federal
or
state
law
shall
govern
the
relations
of
the
parties
with
respect
to
conditions
not
specifically
enumerated
in
the
contract.
now,
the
general
laws,
in
turn,
contained
a
number
of
provisions
which
comprehensively
provide
that
all
employees
performing
work
which
falls
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
itu,
and
the
mailers'
are
among
them,
that
all
such
employees
must
belong
to
the
union.
i
shall
in
a
moment
explain
in
greater
detail,
the
provisions
of
the
contract,
the
provisions
of
the
general
laws
and
also
the
hiring
practice
which
were
pursued
by
the
parties
under
the
agreement,
but
i
think
what
i've
said
suffices
to
pose
the
question
which
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case
as
well
as
the
heart
of
the
case
which
follows
it,
namely,
whether
this
savings
clause
--
whether
this
savings
clause
in
the
contract
suffices
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
can
neutralize
or
suspend
the
otherwise
illegal
provisions
of
the
--
illegal
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
now,
the
board
held
that
the
savings
clause
did
not
have
that
effect,
it
did
not
effectively
suspend
the
otherwise
illegal
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
the
court
below,
on
the
other
hand,
held
that
they
--
it
did
and
the
first
circuit
in
the
case
which
follows
this
one,
although
not
entirely
free
of
doubt
as
endorsed
the
board's
position.
i
shall
sketch
briefly
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
controversy.
the
mailers'
union
is
an
affiliate
of
the
itu,
and
it
represents
mailing
--
the
mail-room
employees
of
all
newspapers
in
a
new
york
city
area
including
the
daily
news
and
the
wall
street
journal.
in
1954
and
again
in
1956,
the
union
ordered
the
contracts
with
the
daily
news
and
the
wall
street
journal
covering
the
employment
of
mail-room
employees
and
the
charges
which
initiated
this
case
before
the
board
challenged
the
legality
of
those
contracts
and
also
the
operation
of
the
hiring
system
under
those
contracts.
the
contract,
which
appears
at
page
527
of
the
record,
section
4
of
the
contract,
which
is
on
page
528
requires
that
the
superintendent
or
the
foreman
or
the
assistant
foreman
in
charged
of
the
mail-room
must
be
a
union
member.
section
5
of
the
contract,
which
appears
on
the
following
page
510
--
529,
limits
employment
to
journeymen
and
apprentices,
and
sections
20
(a)
and
20
(b),
and
i'm
merely
paraphrasing
these
because
they're
rather
lengthy,
and
which
appeared
at
page
532
and
533,
sections
20
(a)
and
20
(b)
vest
exclusive
control
over
the
mail-room
employment,
over
mail-room
hiring,
in
the
foreman
who,
under
section
4
of
the
contract,
is
required
to
be
a
union
member.
and
finally
--
finally,
on
the
following
page,
534,
there
is
section
24
--
section
--
section
24
of
the
contract
which
provides
that
it
is
understood
and
agreed
that
the
general
laws
of
the
international
typographical
union
in
effect
in
january
1955,
not
in
conflict
with
this
contract
or
with
federal
or
state
law
shall
govern
relations
between
the
parties
on
conditions
not
specifically
enumerated
herein.
now,
the
itu
general
laws,
in
turn,
as
i
stated
briefly,
first
of
all,
require
that
all
employees
performing
work
falling
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
itu
must
be
union
members.
the
general
laws
also
have
a
provision
which,
like
the
contract,
require
that
the
foreman
in
charge
of
the
mail-room
or
composing
room,
as
the
case
may
be,
that
he
must
be
a
union
member.
the
general
laws
also
require
the
locals
--
require
the
foreman
to
follow
a
priority
system
prescribed
by
the
local.
and
finally
--
finally,
under
the
constitution
of
both
the
mailers'
union,
as
well
as
the
itu,
every
member
is
under
a
duty
and,
of
course,
this
includes
the
foreman
who,
under
the
contract,
is
required
to
be
a
union
member,
he's
under
an
obligation
to
observe
the
union's
rules.
now,
in
practice,
in
practice,
the
hiring
of
employees
from
the
--
for
the
daily
news,
mail-room
employees
of
the
daily
news
and
the
wall
street
journal
went
something
like
this.
the
work
of
the
mail-room
employees
consist
of
bundling
and
tying
newspapers
and
putting
them
on
trucks
for
delivery
to
their
destination.
and
the
foreman
selects
the
employees
for
each
evening's
work
and
the
number
of
employees
may
vary
depending
upon
the
size
of
the
paper.
it
may
vary
from
50
to
200,
we
are
told.
he
selects
the
employees
from
list
which
are
furnished
to
him
by
the
union
steward
who
was
called
the
"chapel
chairman".
the
first
list
consists
of
full-time
employees
who
are
called
situation
holders.
the
second
list
consists
of
regular
substitutes
who,
either
as
the
name
--
as
the
name
indicates,
either
substitute
for
the
regular
situation
holders
or
supplement
them
in
case
there
was
extra
--
there
was
extra
work.
all
of
those
--
all
of
the
employees
who
appear
on
these
two
lists
are
union
members
and
the
foreman
hires
them
on
the
basis
of
a
priority
determined
by
the
date
on
which
they
have
deposited
their
union
card
with
the
chapel
chairman
or
union
steward.
now,
if,
if,
after
these
two
lists
are
exhausted,
additional
workers
are
needed,
then
the
foreman
will
hire
union
work
--
workmen
who
may
work
for
some
other
newspaper,
but
who
are
available
for
work
either
of
the
daily
news
or
the
wall
street
journal
on
that
particular
occasion.
if
more
workers
are
still
needed,
then
the
foreman
will
hire
the
--
from
nonunion
extras
who,
in
the
parlance
of
the
--
of
the
shop,
shape
the
shop.
now,
despite
occasional
protests,
despite
occasional
protests,
none
of
these
nonunion
extras,
whatever
their
competence,
whatever
their
experience,
are
hired,
until
all
of
the
union
people
have
been
taken
cared
of
including
those
who
may
have
never
worked
either
for
the
wall
street
journal
or
--
or
the
daily
news.
and
they
say
that
none
of
these
are
hired
until
all
of
the
union
people
are
taken
cared
of.
now,
on
these
facts,
which
i
have
sketched
rather
briefly,
the
board
found
that
the
savings
clause
in
the
contract
did
not
effectively
neutralize
or
suspend
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
and
it
found
that
the
contract
and
the
practice
pursued
thereunder,
including
the
foreman
clause,
which
vested
exclusive
hiring
authority
in
the
foreman,
who
is
required
to
be
a
union
member
and
including
--
including
the
general
laws
provision
which
required
the
locals
to
prescribe
a
priority
system
for
its
members
that
the
contract
and
all
these
things
here
established
an
unlawful
closed-shop
and
union
preferential
hiring
system
in
violation
of
the
statute.
now,
in
relevant
part
--
in
relevant
parts,
the
board
ordered
the
parties
to
refrain
from
the
unfair
labor
practice
which
have
been
found
and
in
accordance
with
the
steps
prescribed
in
the
board's
order
to
specify
in
the
contract
which
provisions
of
the
general
laws
were
incorporated
into
the
contract
and
also,
also
to
make
clear,
to
make
clear
that
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws
were
not
binding
either
upon
the
employees
or
the
foreman
who
was
vested
with
exclusive
hiring
authority.
the
board
also,
i
might
add,
had
a
brown-olds
problem
--
a
brown-olds
remedy
in
the
case,
but
i
believe
that
we
don't
reach
that
issue
in
this
case.
we
deal
what
the
court
below
did.
the
court
below
refused
to
enforce
the
board's
order.
it
made
the
initial
critical
threshold
finding
that
the
savings
clause
--
that
the
saving
clause
in
the
contract
was
sufficient,
was
sufficient
to
neutralize
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
and
having
made
--
having
made
this
initial
critical
threshold
finding,
the
board
--
the
court
rather,
the
court
said
aside
the
board's
ancillary
findings
of
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
ground
that
the
record
failed
to
disclose
that
there
had
been
an
unlawful
discrimination
in
the
operation
of
the
hiring
system.
and
as
i
say,
the
court
did
not
reach
the
brown-olds
problem,
of
course,
it
set
--
set
aside
the
board's
order
--
set
aside
the
board's
unfairly
practice
findings.
now,
as
i
have
said,
the
critical
threshold
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
contract,
despite
the
savings
clause
which
purports
to
suspend,
which
purports
to
suspend
whatever
laws
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
--
with
federal
law,
whether
the
contract,
nevertheless,
imposed
upon
the
employees
a
closed-shop.
now,
the
argument
against
us,
the
argument
against
us
is,
in
essence,
in
essence
that
the
savings
clause
must
be
taken
at
face
value
and
hence,
must
be
deemed
to
negative,
must
be
deemed
to
suspend
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
now,
viewed
nakedly,
viewed
nakedly
without
the
gloss
of
history
or
practice
and
perhaps,
it's
clearly
as
a
matter
of
private
contract
law,
the
savings
clause
might
perhaps
be
deemed
to
negative
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
but
we
submit,
we
submit
that
sole
view
of
the
clause
is
to
engage
in
a
dry
syllogistic
exercise
that's
wholly
devoured
of
any
meaningful
insight
in
the
problem
that
we
have
before
us.
in
order
to
appraise
the
significance
of
the
saving
clause,
its
effectiveness
or
it's
ineffectiveness,
we
think,
we
must
look
not
only
to
the
bare
words
of
the
contract,
but
we
must
also
look
to
the
history
behind
it
as
well
as
the
meaning,
as
well
as
the
meaning
which
the
employees
as
well
as
the
hiring
foreman
were
likely
to
attach
to
that
savings
clause.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
don't
--
that
--
that's
right,
we
do
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
we
--
the
--
the
counsel
representing
the
general
counsel
in
this
case
did
not
challenge
the
good
faith
of
the
parties
in
--
in
arriving
at
this
contract.
in
other
words,
we
--
there
was
no
claim
that
this
was
a
subterfuge
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
subterfuge
and,
of
course,
i
am
precluded
by
that
concession
from
arguing
that
this
was
a
subterfuge.
but
we
do
say,
it
is
our
position,
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
in
the
light
of
the
itu's
traditional
historic
closed-shop
policy,
the
role
which
the
general
laws
have
played
in
implementing,
in
implementing
that
policy
and
the
persistent
efforts
which
the
itu
made
even
after
the
closed-shop
had
been
outlawed
in
1947
to
preserve
that
traditional
close
policy,
we
say
that
the
parties,
without
having
specified
which
provisions
of
the
general
laws
were
included
in
the
contract
and
which
were
not
included
in
the
contract
that
they
could
foreseeably,
foreseeably
see
that
the
employees
would
give
those
significance,
would
give
those
significance
in
the
saving
clause,
that
they
would
continue
to
regard
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws
and
continue
to
be
operative
and
that
therefore,
therefore,
the
savings
clause,
having
those
foreseeable
results,
consequences
that
the
parties
must
be
deemed
to
have
intended,
to
have
intended
to
include
their
closed-shop
provisions
in
the
contract,
that's
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
now,
for
nearly
a
century,
for
nearly
a
century,
prior
to
1947,
the
itu
has
avowedly
followed
a
closed-shop
policy.
this
has
been
in
the
historic,
traditional
policy
of
the
itu.
and
the
general
laws
which
the
itu
has
insisted
on
incorporating
by
virtue
of
these
incorporation
clauses,
the
--
the
general
laws
which
the
itu
has
insisted
in
incorporating
in
collective
bargaining
agreements,
have
played
a
significant
role
in
insuring
and
preserving
that
closed-shop
policy.
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
the
closed-shop
requires
that
all
people
performing
work
following
the
jurisdiction
of
the
itu
must
be
union
members.
they
have
a
clause
that
requires
a
foreman
to
be
a
union
member
and
have
--
and
have
exclusive
hiring
authority,
they
provide
for
union
control
over
apprentice
system.
they
provide
for
union
control
over
a
competency
test,
but
100-year
old
policy
is
not
easily
abandon
and,
of
course,
the
itu
is
not
an
exception.
is
not
--
or
did
prove
that
you
bid
any
different
in
this
respect
because
both
before,
both
before
and
after
1947,
when
congress
outlawed
the
closed-shop,
the
itu
gave
notice
that
it
would
not
abandon
its
historic
and
traditional
closed-shop
policy
and
the
overt
steps,
the
overt
steps
which
the
itu
took
after
1947,
after
the
closed-shop
was
outlawed
by
congress,
the
overt
steps
which
the
itu
took
in
--
in
relation
with
publishers
to
preserve
and
maintain
the
closed-shop
are
a
matter
of
judicial
record.
they
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
i
will
not
attempt
to
recapitulate
them
here.
now,
following
these
unsuccessful
efforts,
the
itu
then
pursued
the
policy
of
incorporating
its
general
--
the
general
laws,
the
general
laws
in
the
--
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
but
added
the
savings
clause.
and
they
added
a
comparable
proviso
to
their
general
laws,
but
other
than
that,
they
made
no
significant
change
in
their
general
laws.
at
no
time,
at
no
time
has
the
itu
given
its
membership
for
its
locals,
a
list
of
the
laws
which
were
suspended
because
they
were
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
and
although
in
1953,
the
itu
did
amend
its
oath
of
membership,
so
as
to
delete
a
provision
in
there,
which
required
union
members
to
prefer
fellow
union
members
in
employment,
no
instructions
have
ever
been
issued
to
foreman
generally,
as
to
which
of
the
laws
were
no
longer
binding
upon
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
exclusive
hiring
authority.
indeed,
as
a
record
in
the
case
which
follows
(inaudible)
when
publishers
have
sought
to
persuade
the
itu
to
specify
which
laws
were
deemed
to
be
operative
and
which
were
not
deemed
to
be
operative,
the
itu
has
refused
to
do
so
and
instead,
it
has
insisted
upon
this
vague
exclusionary
clause.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
far
as
i
know,
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
we
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
we've
had
cases,
your
honor,
which
have
--
which
have
had
contracts
containing
an
illegal
union
security
clause
with
some
kind
of
a
suspension
clause.
we've
had
that.
but
i
think
this
is
one
of
the
few
cases
that
we've
had
with
this
tremendous
history
impact
of
the
contract.
i
mean
the
itu's
traditional
closed-shop
policy,
that's
a
rather
unique
sort
of
situation.
but
we
have
had
cases,
we
have
had
cases
which
involved
the
effective
suspension
of
the
suspension
clause
in
the
contract,
there's
a
number
of
them.
now,
the
act
guarantees
to
employees
the
right
to
obtain
employment
without
being
union
members.
and
a
contract
which
imposes
that
condition
infringes
upon
that
right.
collective
bargaining
contracts
have
an
impact
beyond
the
parties
--
the
immediate
parties
to
the
contract.
they
do
have
a
significant
impact
upon
the
employees.
and
it
is
our
position,
it
is
our
position
that
a
contract
of
this
kind,
contract
of
this
--
that
--
that
in
interpreting
a
contract
to
this
kind,
we
must
take
into
account
what
the
employers
are
likely
foreseeably
to
read
into
a
savings
clause
of
the
kind
that
we
have
here.
we
say
that
if
it
was
--
if
it
is
foreseeable
that
the
employees
will
pay
--
give
low
--
intentionally
give
low
significance
to
the
savings
clause
and
that
they
will
continue
to
regard
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws
as
being
--
as
continued
to
be
operative,
then
we
say
that
the
parties
here
must
be
deemed
to
have
been
intended
that
arrangement.
we
believe
that
the
board
is
entitled
to
make
that
judgment
in
this
case.
the
savings
clause
shifts
from
the
employee
--
shifts
to
the
employers
the
duty,
the
duty
of
forecasting
which
of
the
laws
are
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute
and
which
are
not,
which
are
incorporated
in
the
contract
and
which
are
not
incorporated
in
the
contract.
the
general
laws
themselves
certainly
give
them
little
guidance
because,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
all
of
the
general
laws
have
is
a
savings
clause
comparable
to
the
one
in
the
contract
here.
and
moreover,
curiously
enough,
curiously
enough,
the
general
laws
continue
to
assert,
continue
to
assert
that
various
unspecified
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
law
are
either
invalid
or
unconstitutional.
and
the
contract
itself
gives
the
employees
no
guidance
either
because
it
just
simply
has
this
vague
exclusionary
clause
that
whatever
provisions
of
the
general
laws
that
are
not
in
conflict
with
the
federal
state
--
that
those
provisions
which
are
in
conflict
with
federal
--
with
federal
state
law
are
not
incorporated
in
the
contract.
now,
if
the
parties
themselves
were
either
incapable
or
unwilling
to
specify,
what
provisions
of
the
general
laws
were
suspended
and
what
were
not,
how
much
more
difficult
a
task
could
have
been
for
the
employees
as
well
as
the
foreman
who
was
vested
with
exclusive
hiring
authority.
surely,
they
cannot
be
expected
to
pay
the
part
of
the
lawyers.
we
think,
we
think
that
the
result
would
be
that
they
would
regard
the
savings
clause
as
either
of
little
significance
or
is
merely
signifying
that
perhaps,
in
some
future
date,
there
might
be
some
judicial
determination
that
some
of
the
laws
were
no
longer
applicable.
now,
the
consequence
of
that
kind
of
a
situation
would
be
that
the
foreman,
in
order
to
hedge,
the
foreman
has
to
be
a
union
member
in
order
to
be
able
to
hold
his
job,
that
the
foreman
in
order
to
hedge
against
possible
disciplinary
action
of
the
hands
of
the
union,
possible
loss
of
employment
as
a
foreman,
that
he
would
continue
to
abide
by
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
secondly,
that
the
employees
too
would
play
it
safe,
would
play
it
safe,
and
they
too,
as
a
hedge
against
the
laws
of
employment,
would
either
maintain
their
membership
in
the
union
in
good
standing
or
be
encouraged
to
join,
to
join
the
union.
in
a
very
real,
in
a
very
real
in
the
practical
sense,
we
think
that
the
parties
here
are
created
a
situation,
have
created
a
situation
were
the
employees
will
act
as
though
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
general
laws
had
been
specifically
included
in
the
contract.
and
we
say,
we
say
that
the
board
is
entitled
--
is
entitled
to
say
that
the
vague
savings
clause
does
had
that
foreseeable
consequence
and
with
the
employees
will
act
as
though
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
contract
had
been
specifically
inserted
in
the
contract
and
that
therefore,
the
parties
here
are
just
as
legally
at
fault,
as
though
they
have
specifically
included
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws
into
the
contact
itself.
now,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
with
--
what
i'm
saying,
as
to
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
this
kind
of
a
clause,
is
mere
speculation.
because
the
record
in
this
case
--
and
the
record
is
--
makes
--
makes
it
clear
that
those
who
were
in
charge
of
hiring,
superintendent
and
foreman
who
were
in
charge
of
hiring
in
the
mail-room
of
the
daily
news
in
the
wall
street
journal,
that
they
deemed
themselves
bound
by
the
itu
rules.
one
of
them
testifies
that
he
saw
no
conflicts,
they
saw
no
conflict
between
the
itu
rules
and
the
taft-hartley
statute
and
finally,
one
of
them
said
that,
if
he
had
a
choice
to
make
as
between
two
equally
competent
people,
two
equally
competent
journeymen,
he
would
select
the
union
member.
and
finally,
let
me
add
this,
let
me
add
this
that
as
the
record
in
the
case
which
follows
this,
shows
it
was
precisely
for
this
reason
that
the
publishers,
in
succeeding
case
oppose,
oppose
these
general
laws
clause
because
they
felt,
they
felt
that
the
employees
would
continue
to
regard
the
closed-shop
provisions
as
being
operative
and
binding
upon
them.
and
for
these
reasons,
we
believe
that
the
board's
position
on
this
issue
should
be
sustained.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
the
contract,
the
contract
does
not
have
any
provision
saying
that,
saying
that
union
membership
is
a
condition
of
employment.
but
we
do
say,
we
do
say
that
the
vague
savings
clause
has
the
foreseeable
effect
of
including,
of
including
in
the
eyes
of
the
employees,
of
including
the
illegal
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws,
and
that,
therefore,
therefore,
even
though
there's
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
contract
that
says
closed-shop
provisions
are
in
effect,
that
therefore,
the
parties
must
be
deemed
in
view
of
those
foreseeable
consequences
as
though
they
had
expressly
included
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws
into
the
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
all
that
means,
all
that
means
that
there
is
no
specific
closed-shop
provisions
in
the
contract
itself.
there
is
no
provisions
saying
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
we
take
the
position
not
that
this
--
it's
a
savings
clause
--
the
savings
clause,
that
because
of
what
we
deemed
to
be
is
its
ineffectiveness.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
to
suspend
the
general
laws.
now,
that
--
that
suit
was
foreseeable
to
the
parties
who
entered
into
this
contract.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
the
foreseeable
consequence
of
this
kind
of
a
clause.
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
we
--
the
board
found
here,
the
board
found
here
that
there
had
been
actual
discrimination.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
court
disagreed
on
that,
but
we
think,
your
honor,
we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
court
in
reaching
that
conclusion
was
largely
influenced
by
the
fact
that
he
had
rejected
the
board's
original
position.
it's
the
threshold,
the
threshold
proposition
of
the
board
that
this
contract,
this
contract,
in
effect,
included
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws.
had
the
court
below
agreed
with
us
on
that,
i
think
that
there
is
a
serious
question,
a
serious
question
whether
the
court
would've
looked
to
the
actual
operations
of
the
hiring
system
as
being
an
innocent
non-discriminatory
one.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
we
do.
yes,
because,
your
honor,
as
i
indicated
or
perhaps,
i
didn't
indicated
here,
in
practice,
in
practice
here,
the
union
foreman
and
the
union's
admission
committee,
they
administer
the
competency
test.
and
then
they
selected
that
members
from
those
whom
they
had
found
qualified.
and
--
but
these
employees
and
then
these
employees
once
they
had
been
admitted
into
the
union,
once
--
then
they
enjoyed
priority
over
the
non
--
the
nonunion
extras,
the
nonunion
extras.
now,
in
1956,
when
the
union
decided
to
enlarge
its
membership,
it
took
in
some
31
out
of
a
60
nonunion
extras
in
the
mail-room
of
the
daily
news.
thereafter,
those
31
employees
who
were
inducted
in
the
union,
they
enjoyed
priority
over
all
the
nonunion
extras,
all
over
all
the
nonunion
extras,
including
one
of
the
charging
parties
in
this
case,
randall,
even
though
prior
to
their
induction
into
the
union,
randall
had
had
seniority
over
30,
over
30
of
the
31
men
who
had
been
taken
into
the
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
did
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
did
not
preserve
that
question,
your
honor.
but
as
i
say,
i
think
that
the
--
those
that
--
at
the
basic
issue,
the
threshold
issue
in
this
case
is
so
intertwined,
is
so
intertwined
with
the
operation
of
the
--
of
the
--
the
actual
practical
operation
of
the
hiring
system,
that
you
really
can't
divorce
it
to.
and
that
there
is
nothing,
it
seems
to
me,
that
precludes
this
court
from
looking
at
the
objective
facts
but
the
objective
facts
relating
to
the
hiring
system
has
practiced
both
by
the
daily
news
and
the
wall
street
journal.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
seems
to
us
that
you
can
still
look
at
what
the
objective
facts
were
as
to
the
how
the
hiring
did
--
did
proceed.
now,
it's
true,
it's
true
that
the
court
below
disagreed
with
the
inference
that
the
board
drew,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
illegal
discrimination.
now,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
precludes
this
court,
however,
from
looking
at
the
objective
facts.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
otherwise,
your
honor,
if
it
seems
that
the
court
doesn't
look
to
the
background,
to
the
--
to
the
background
here.
there
will
be
--
that
you
would
just
simply
have
an
abstract
question
and
it's
important,
i
think,
in
order
to
appraise
the
situations,
you'll
look
to
that.
and
we
say
that
it's
important
because
in
large
measure,
at
least
it's
our
view,
in
large
measure,
the
court
below
found
that
non-discriminatory
operation
of
the
hiring
system
largely
because
of
its
rejection
of
the
board's
position
with
respect
to
the
savings
clause.
thank
you.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
42a?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
once
--
once
they
had
decided,
once
they
had
decided
that
the
--
that
the
closed-shop
provisions
of
the
general
laws
were
not
incorporated
in
the
contract
or
that
there
was
no
reason
to
attribute
to
the
parts
that
they
could
have
foreseen
that
the
employees
would've
acted
as
though
they
were
closed-shop
provisions.
once
the
court
had
made
that
critical
threshold
finding,
he
could
very
--
he'd
very
easily
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
--
that
the
hiring
was
done
in
a
very
benign
non-discriminatory
fashion.
but
had
they
agreed
with
us,
had
they
agreed
with
us
on
our
threshold
proposition,
i
venture
to
say
that
the
court
might
have
had
a
different
view
of
the
actual
operation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
suppose
that
we
didn't
raise
it
because
we
had
so
many
other
issues
in
the
case
and
that
we
felt
that
unless
we
could
win
upon
these
threshold
questions
that
we'd
never
be
able
to
get
to
that
last
one.
