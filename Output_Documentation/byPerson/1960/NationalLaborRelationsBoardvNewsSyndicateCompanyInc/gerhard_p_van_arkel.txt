mr.
gerhard
p.
van
arkel
may
it
please
the
court,
your
honor.
the
board's
order
in
this
case
rests
on
a
single
undisputed
fact,
namely,
that
all
journeymen
mailers
hired
by
the
new
york
publishers
were
members
of
the
union.
your
honors
will
agree
with
me
that
this
is
a
completely
neutral
fact,
that
is,
to
say
it
is,
of
course,
consistent
with
the
closed-shop
agreement
or
practice.
it
is
equally
consistent
with
the
perfectly
lawful
right
of
all
of
these
employees
to
join
the
union
if
they
wish.
it,
therefore,
becomes
necessary
to
look
further
to
ascertain
the
significance
of
this
fact
and
happily
on
this
record,
we
need
not
look
far.
there
is,
in
this
record,
notes
until
i
have
evidence
that
any
employee
was
restrained
or
coerced
or
was
persuaded
or
induced
or
was
even
asked
to
become
a
union
member.
the
rest
of
the
contrary,
if
massive
evidence
from
a
many
witnesses
including
the
charging
parties
themselves,
that
all
of
the
employees
who
were
eligible
to
union
membership
were
not
only
willing,
but
eager
to
join.
so,
if
we
put
aside
the
board's
unwarranted
assumption
that
it
is
unthinkable
that
all
of
the
employees
in
a
bargaining
unit
would
desire
to
become
a
union
members
and
look
instead
at
this
record,
this
quest
--
the
significance
of
this
fact,
the
want
of
significance
of
it,
immediately
appears.
but
says
the
board,
union
men
were
hired
before
nonunion
men,
so
they
were,
and
this
statement
is
as
grossly
misleading
as
half
truths
normally
are.
had
the
board
desired
to
be
candid
with
your
honors,
they
would
have
said
that
pursuant
to
be
expressed
provisions
of
the
agreement
between
the
parties.
journeymen,
all
of
whom
had
lawfully
undertaken
to
become
union
members,
were
hired
before
casual
extras,
none
of
whom
were
union
members
because
the
union
had
lawfully
undertaken
to
admit
none
of
them
to
membership.
that
is
what
the
findings
of
the
fact
--
the
fact
to
the
board
amounted
to.
they
were
set
aside
in
their
entirety
by
the
court
below.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
a
reading
of
judge
hanks
opinion
will
demonstrate
that
he
saw
complete
through
the
verbal
trick
by
which
the
board
attempted
to
fasten
on
the
parties
here,
in
assertion
of
unfair
labor
practices.
your
honors,
therefore,
have
before
you
a
case
in
which
it
was
conceded
that
the
hearing
below
that
this
contract
is
lawful
on
its
face.you
have
findings
which
were
not
challenged
here
because
the
board
did
not
seek
certiorari,
that
the
practices
under
this
contract
were
entirely
lawful.
we
say
to
your
honors
that
your
opinions
have
made
it
entirely
clear
that
the
entire
reach
of
the
board's
powers
has
been
reached
when
it
has
once
been
found
that
the
contract
is
lawful
and
that
the
practices
under
it
have
been
lawful.
there
is
only
one
ground
for
asserting
the
contrary
that
is
a
reliance
on
certain
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
epitomized
by
the
red
star
express
line
of
cases,
which
hold
that
where
an
agreement
is
unlawful
on
its
face,
a
savings
clause
will
not
cure
the
defect.
now,
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
our
reasons
for
questioning
the
--
those
holdings
of
the
court.
but
accepting
them
as
a
correct
statement
of
the
law,
it
must
be
entirely
clear
that
where
a
contract
is
lawful
on
its
face
as
this
one
is
conceded
to
be,
that
there
is
no
meet
for
any
savings
clause,
there
is
nothing
to
say,
there
is
therefore
in
this
contract
no
savings
clause
and
this
line
of
case
is,
therefore,
has
absolutely
no
application.
the
court
below
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
honolulu
star-bulletin
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
six
circuit
in
the
fentress
coal
&
coke
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
quality
coal
and
perry
coal
cases,
have
all
distinguished
the
red
star
line
of
authority
on
this
very
ground.
we
suggest
to
your
honors
that
this
is
the
appropriate
reading
of
the
statute
that
therefore
the
holding
of
the
court
below
is
correct,
and
we
urge
that
your
honors
affirm
the
judgment
below.
