mr.
richard
e.
gorman
i
am
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
prosecution
was
commenced
on
december
the
13th,
1957
by
the
return
of
an
indictment
in
four
counts.
these
counts
charged
a
violation
of
the
internal
revenue
statutes
for
the
years
of
1951,
1952
and
1953
under
the
old
section
145
(b)
and
in
1954
under
the
applicable
section
number
7201
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
the
matter
was
tried
to
a
court
on
the
waiver
of
a
jury.
the
amounts
which
were
involved
totaled
approximately
$700,000.
there
was
a
finding
of
guilty
by
the
court
and
special
findings
of
fact
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
were
entered.
these
findings
of
fact
were
most
detailed
and
fulsome
and
appear
in
both
the
brief
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
in
summary,
it
might
be
said
that
the
petitioner,
eugene
c.
james
was
an
official
of
the
international
laundry
workers
union
and
also
was
the
secretary
treasurer
of
local
46
of
the
international
laundry
workers
union
in
chicago,
illinois.
the
funds
which
were
the
subject
matter
of
this
embezzlement
which
was
so
found
especially
by
the
court
to
be
an
embezzlement
were
funds
which
were
contributed
to
a
welfare
--
a
health
and
welfare
organization
within
the
international
and
within
the
local
union.
these
funds
were
especially
contributed
by
management
of
the
various
members
of
the
union
or
for
the
benefit
of
the
various
members
of
the
union
and
were
then
contributed
to
a
special
fund
which
was
set
up
in
indianapolis,
indiana
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
this
health
and
welfare
plan
for
the
members
of
the
union.
the
mr.
james
was
a
secretary
treasurer
of
the
international
union
as
well
as
being
a
secretary
treasurer
of
the
laundry
workers
local
number
46.
the
funds
were
diverted
by
mr.
james
and
one
mr.
saperstein
who
was
an
agent
of
the
insurance
company
which
was
underwriting
these
health
and
welfare
plan.
the
moneys
were
diverted
to
james
and
were
set
up
in
a
special
bank
account
in
chicago,
illinois
and
then
were
removed
from
that
bank
account
by
him,
by
the
checks
drawn
to
cash
and
in
some
instances
checks
drawn
from
his
own
name.
and
they,
in
the
bulk,
set
up
the
funds
which,
as
i
said,
were
the
subject
matter
of
this
embezzlement.
the
court
in
its
findings
of
fact
held
that
this
money
was
embezzled
money
and
it
was
upon
this
finding
of
fact
that
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
in
its
conclusions
of
law,
the
court
held
that
the
lawyers
--
that
the
financial
or
monitory
gains
to
a
taxpayer
was
a
lawfully
or
unlawfully
acquired,
constitutes
taxable
income
to
the
taxpayer
in
the
year
in
which
he
had
such
control
over
it.
that
is
a
practical
matter
he
derived
readily
realizable
economic
value
from
it.
it
is
immaterial
whether
the
receipt
of
funds
by
a
taxpayer
without
results
from
misappropriation,
embezzlement,
or
other
lawful
or
unlawful
acts.
it
is
with
the
court's
opinion
that
the
embezzled
funds
in
this
case
constituted
a
gain,
which
was
such
a
gain
that
it
could
be
--
it
could
be
considered
subject
to
income
tax
that
we
take
exception
in
this
petition
here.
this
matter
was
first
before
this
court
in
the
case
of
internal
revenue
commissioner
versus
wilcox,
and
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
that
case
in
judge
--
justice
murphy's
decision,
in
his
opinion,
he
started
out
with
these
words,
“the
sole
issue
here
is
whether
embezzled
money
constitutes
taxable
income
to
the
embezzler
under
section
22
(a)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.”
that
is
the
exact
same
question
that
we
appear
before
this
court
for
its
decisions
here
today.
and
it
is
also
interesting
to
note
that
in
that
case
practically
the
same
argument
was
made
by
the
government
as
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
in
the
briefs
which
are
submitted
here.
since
the
time
of
the
wilcox
case,
no
other
decision
has
treated
that
case
as
being
overruled
and,
except
the
decision
in
this
case
in
the
seventh
circuit,
there
have
been
numerous
decisions
by
courts,
various
circuit
courts
across
the
land,
in
which
the
decision
in
the
wilcox
case
has
been
distinguished
but
there
is
no
case
except
the
case
in
which
we
appear
before
your
honors
today
in
which
it
has
been
held
that
the
wilcox
case
is
no
longer
controlling
in
cases
concerning
embezzled
funds.
we
wish
to
point
out
to
this
court
in
answer
to
the
assertions
in
the
government's
brief
that
there
has
been
no
intension
and
there
is
no
intension
on
our
part
to
make
an
argument
as
to
the
illegality
of
the
receipt
of
the
funds.
our
contention
is
strictly
this;
that
embezzled
funds
do
not
constitute
a
gain,
a
taxable
gain,
to
the
embezzler,
and
therefore,
they
have
been
held
not
to
be
income
--
not
to
be
subject
to
the
income
tax
laws.
the
difficulty
that
seems
to
have
arisen
in
connection
with
the
cases
which
have
been
held
or
heard
since
the
wilcox
decision
is
been
the
dicta
which
has
been
put
forward
by
the
various
courts
of
appeal
that
is
to
the
effect
that
the
rutkin
case,
a
case
subsequent
to
wilcox,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1954,
pardon
me
in
1952,
in
some
way
overruled
the
wilcox
case.
to
this
argument,
we
can
see
no
basis,
because
in
the
rutkin
case
itself,
in
the
opinion
in
the
rutkin
case,
this
court
specifically
stated
that
the
wilcox
case
was
a
case
of
embezzlement
and
that
this
court
left
that
case
on
its
own
facts
and
that
the
rutkin
case
was
a
case
of
extortion.
therefore,
it
would
appear
that
there
was
a
limitation
which
exists
since
the
time
of
the
rutkin
case
but
the
rutkin
case
in
no
way
has
extended
the
doctrine
that
was
set
forth
in
the
wilcox
case
that
embezzled
funds
are
not
subject
to
income
tax
liability.
the
james
case
since
the
wilcox
case,
in
our
opinion,
is
the
closest
situation
factually
that
we
have
since
that
case
was
decided.
in
both
the
james
case
and
then
the
wilcox
case,
there
was
an
actual
embezzlement.
in
both
the
james
case
and
then
the
wilcox
case,
there
was
an
active
pursuit
of
the
embezzler
by
local
authorities.
in
the
wilcox
case,
the
embezzler
was
pursuit
by
the
local
state
authorities
and
was
convicted
of
embezzlement
and
served
time
in
the
penitentiary.
and
i
might
say
in
passing
here
that
in
the
james
case,
the
same
situation
exists.
there
was
returned
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
a
indictment
charging
both
james
and
saperstein
with
conspiracy
to
embezzle
that
indictment
was
in
effect
during
the
time
of
the
existence
of
dependency
of
this
case
and
it
is
only
in
this
week
that
as
a
result
of
a
plea
of
guilty
before
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
jersey,
that
the
petitioner
james
here
was
sentenced
to
term
of
one
to
two
years
in
the
penitentiary
on
the
conspiracy
to
embezzle
indictment.
all
of
the
lower
court
decisions,
which
have
been
cited
by
the
government
and
which
have
been
discussed
by
the
various
courts
of
appeals
are
in
our
opinion
distinguishable.
it
might
--
they
are
a
fourth
set
out
in
our
brief
in
detail
and
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
a
recitation
of
the
facts
in
each
one
of
those
cases,
but
it
is
apparent
in
each
one
of
those
cases
that
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
come
within
the
doctrine
of
the
wilcox
case,
but
that
that
attempt
was
more
of
a
legal
stratagem
than
something
that
existed
in
reality.
and
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
courts
were
able
to
distinguish
the
wilcox
case
from
the
presentation
of
facts
in
those
cases
and
it
was
held
that
they
were
not
within
the
doctrine
of
the
wilcox
case,
because
they
were
not
in
fact
embezzlers
but
they
were
perpetrators
of
many
other
types
of
offences.
it's
interesting
if
one
of
those
cases,
however,
to
point
out
that
in
the
prokop
case,
which
was
decided
in
the
seventh
circuit,
that
the
government
itself
in
its
brief,
and
this
is
pointed
out
in
our
brief
on
page
41,
adopted
the
distinction
and
argued
the
distinction
before
the
court
of
appeals
between
the
wilcox
case
and
the
rutkin
case
and
pointed
out
there
that
the
rutkin
case
was
a
case
of
extortion
and
that
so
was
the
prokop
case,
a
case
of
extortion,
and
that
therefore
mrs.
prokop,
who
also
happened
to
be
a
union
official,
could
not
bring
herself
within
the
doctrine
of
the
wilcox
case
because
she
just
was
in
fact
plainly
not
an
embezzler.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
the
–
the
--
difference
is
in
the
type
of
the
events
as
we
see
it
and
as
i
think
the
courts
have
pointed
out.
the
embezzler,
and
this
court
has
recognized
and
almost
all
courts
have
recognized
in
approximate
maybe
90%
of
the
cases,
is
always
detected.
the
embezzler
in
many
cases
is
a
person
who
takes
funds
with
the
intent
to
restore
them.
the
embezzler
in
most
every
case,
when
he
is
caught
up
with
so
to
speak,
restitution
has
been
a
part
of
the
penalty
that
attaches
to
the
crime.
whereas,
with
extortion
we
have
the
--
as
the
court
said
itself,
the
unlikely
act
of
repudiation
of
the
act.
the
extorter
takes
the
money
with
a
clear
claim
to
that
money
so
far
as
he
is
concerned
as
against
the
whole
world
and
it
is
unlikely
that
the
extortee
would
ever
pursue
him.
in
embezzlement
cases,
we
almost
always
have
a
pursuit;
we
almost
always
have
a
definite
and
an
unconditional
obligation
to
repay,
which
as
this
court
pointed
out
subsequent
to
the
rutkin
decision,
in
the
alison
decision
of
this
court
was
a
very
lively,
was
a
very
lively
contingency,
because
in
the
alison
case
this
court
pointed
out
that
a
great
deal
of
the
money,
which
was
embezzled
from
the
alisons
was
recovered
by
them
and
although
that
would
be
--
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
oh
that
well
maybe,
but
the
distinction
which
this
court
made,
if
your
honor
please,
was
that
the
likelihood
of
their
being
any
chance
that
the
extorter
would
be
called
to
test
if
that
that
is
very
unlikely.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
it
doesn't
change
--
it
doesn't
the
principle
except
that
this
court
has
held
that
in
embezzlement
cases
there
is
no
taxable
gain
to
the
embezzler.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
not
at
all,
and
this
court
has
so
stated.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
that
they
are
consistent.
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
there
has
been,
if
your
honor
please.
and
if
your
honor
will
refer
to
our
brief
on
page
51,
we
set
forth
a
bill
which
has
been
proposed
in
congress
to
amend
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
to
provide
that
the
proceeds
of
certain
crimes
shall
be
included
as
gross
income
and
it
is
--
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
no.
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
bill
which
was
proposed
by
an
individual
congressman,
if
your
honor
please.
i
don't
have
the
reference
to
the
congressman
himself
here
but
the
number
of
the
bill
and
it
set
forth
in
total
appears
on
page
51
of
our
brief.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
wilcox
was
decided
in
1946.
the
rutkin
case
was
decided
in
1952,
and
the
congress,
if
we
are
going
to
argue
that
the
congress
intended
that
this
particular
source
of
funds
is
to
be
considered
a
taxable
gain,
that
congress
have
in
its
power
in
1954
when
there
was
a
broad
revision
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
the
opportunity
to
insert
this
which
wasn't
done.
there
is
no
congressional
intent
present
as
we
can
see
to
alter
the
internal
revenue
code
and
it
would
appear
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
that
the
congress
accepted
the
authority
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
wilcox
case.
the
--
the
nub
of
the
whole
case
comes
down
to
just
one
question
insofar
as
we
are
concerned
and
that
is
what
tax
--
what
constitutes
a
taxable
gain
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
proceeds
of
embezzlement
do
not
constitute
a
taxable
gain.
we
are
not
belaboring
the
fact
that
it
might
be
a
source
of
funds
from
an
illegal
source.
the
government
spends
a
great
deal
of
time
in
arguing
that.
we
don't
contend
that.
our
sole
contention
is
that
the
wilcox
case
is
still
in
full
force
in
effect
that
the
effect
of
the
wilcox
case
is
to
a
whole
that
embezzled
funds
are
not
taxable.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
reply.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
just
a
couple
of
brief
in
my
--
if
your
honors
please.
as
been
pointed
out,
i
don't
think
and
i
know
that
this
court
won't
take
into
consideration
the
amounts
of
money
that
are
concerned
here.
it's
certainly,
if
i
shot
the
conscience
of
some
people
that
$700,000
is
involved
here,
but
the
question
is
here,
it
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
court,
what
is
the
law
and
what
was
the
law
at
the
time
that
these
tax
returns
were
filed.
the
question
of
willfulness
as
that
has
been
pointed
out
here
doesn't
have
to
be
pleaded.
we
don't
have
to
do
anything
in
the
defense
of
a
case
such
as
this
but
accept
the
law
as
the
law
is.
i
must
take
exception
to
one
other
statement
of
counsel
that
many
cases
have
held
have
overruled
the
wilcox
case.
those
cases
have
distinguished
the
wilcox
case
not
overruled
the
wilcox
case.
mr.
richard
e.
gorman
that
is
correct
your
honor
please.
there
is
no
case
except
the
case
that
is
presently
before
this
court
so
far
as
we
know
that
it
held
that
embezzled
funds
as
such
are
taxable.
and
with
that,
we
leave
it
to
the
court.
thank
you.
