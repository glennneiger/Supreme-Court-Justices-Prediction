justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
efforts
made
so
far
as
you
know
that
congress
changed
at
all
in
this
respect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
that
proposed?
who
proposed
it?
do
you
know?
the
treasurer,
did
the
treasurer
offer
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
wilcox
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
though
you
were
saying
the
government
on
that
side
that
he
is
supposed
to
know
the
law.
he
is
supposed
to
know
i
guess
the
wilcox
case
that
was
here
before
14
years
the
court
had
it
up
several
times
and
left
it
alone.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
undoubtedly
they
had
enough
evidence,
i
suppose,
to
show
that
he
embezzled
this
and
had
not
reported
this
embezzlement
funds,
but
there
would
also
but
behind
that,
at
least
were
usually
accepted
the
congress
changes
it,
he
didn't
have
to
report
it
14
years
ago.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
rutkin
didn't
--
did
rutkin
overrule
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
say
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
think
i
argued
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court
proved
it.
here's
what
the
court
said,
“we
do
not
reach
in
this
case
the
factual
situation
involved
in
commissioner
versus
wilcox.
there
embezzled
funds
were
held
not
to
constitute
taxable
income
to
the
embezzler
under
22
(a).
the
issue
here
is
whether
money
extorted
from
a
victim
with
his
consent
induced
solely
by
harassing
demands
and
threats
of
violence
is
included
in
the
definition
of
gross
income.”
now
the
name
is
different.
the
names
--
and
the
other
one
was
wilcox
and
the
name
here
is
james
but
they
are
both
embezzler.
justice
hugo
l.
black
perhaps
it
seems
to
me
like
it's
treating
the
opinion
of
the
court
was
to
get
respect
if
i
may
say
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
intended
thereby
to
leave
--
overrule
wilcox
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
should've
overruled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
adopting
my
argument
in
dissentient
in
part,
are
you
not?
i
think
i
said
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
said
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
that
close
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
have
anything
do
to
the
tax
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
some
several
years
ago,
we
had
a
question
of
base
law
in
(inaudible).
the
government
at
that
time
insisted
that
while
the
reasoning
–
the
reasoning
just
didn't
justify
the
distinction.
the
government
i
think
took
a
little
different
position
in
connection
with
that
case,
isn't
it,
than
you
are
taking
in
this
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so,
what
was
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
reference
to
the
exemption
of
baseball
from
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
the
man
can
get
a
deduction
for
a
receipt,
because
he
was
forced
to
pay
back
the
money
he
stole?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
statute
--
well,
i
know
how
you
feel
but
what
statute?
what
rules
have
there
been
here
before
to
set
the
man
to
take
the
deduction
on
account
law
break?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
talking
about
deduction.
i'm
not
sure,
maybe
it
has
been
done
but
i
was
asking
to
know
if
it
could
be
done.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
heffron,
i
want
to
ask
you.
has
the
treasury
made
any
comfort
at
all
if
the
wilcox
case
is
changed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
talking
has
it
gone
to
lower
courts
to
do,
has
it
gone
to
congress
which
had
power
to
you.
