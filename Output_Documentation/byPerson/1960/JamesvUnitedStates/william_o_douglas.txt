justice
william
o.
douglas
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
about
this
particular
case
is
how
a
person,
who
makes
a
tax
return
on
the
basis
on
which
this
court
has
said
the
return
is
proper,
can
be
convicted
willful
default,
willful
evasion,
willful
avoidance,
because
if
that
wilcox
case
have
never
been
overruled,
it
was
distinguished
whether
right
or
wrong
it
still
there
as
subsisting
authority
and
man
follows
it,
why
would
a
man
who
follows
it
--
how
he
could
end
up
in
prison,
i
don't
understand
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
didn't
find
it
in
this
brief
but
i'm
asking
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
but
if
there
--
that
this
particular
--
wilcox
isn't
cloudy
it's
a
decision
it's
there
and
it's
been
--
it's
been
propped
up
as
others
decisions
have
combined.
i
can
see
how
you
could
say
on
an
assessment
to
well,
this
is
--
i
think
it
should
be
overruled,
we
are
going
to
get
it,
but
how
you
can
send
that
man
to
prison
for
making
a
return
basis
of
which
we
have
sustained
in
our
decision
as
still
beyond,
i
don't
care
whether
the
point
is
raised
or
not.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
want
us
to
do
it
retroactively
not
respectively.
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
the
man
borrows
$5,000
with
fraudulent
purpose
of
not
ever
repaying
it.
is
that
a
gain?
