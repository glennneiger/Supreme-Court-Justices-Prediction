mr.
howard
a.
heffron
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
the
petitioner's
position
here,
it
comes
down
to
an
assertion
that
unlawful
gains
of
every
character
are
taxable
because
the
rutkin
case,
in
effect,
held
them
to
be
taxable
the
bribes,
the
graft
paid,
the
kickbacks,
the
gambling
gains,
the
proceeds
from
illicit
liquor,
the
whole
long
catalog
of
illicit
games
which
have
been
held
taxable,
petitioner
has
no
quarrel
with,
but
he
says
that
somehow
this
court
has
carve
or
should
carve
in
this
case
a
privilege
sanctuary
for
the
embezzler.
the
embezzler
should
be
free
from
tax
while
all
the
other
recipients
of
their
illicit
gains
must
pay
the
income
tax.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
is
no
contention
along
those
lines
made
here
by
the
petitioner.
he
does
not
forward
that
argument.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
filed
his
returns
on
the
basis
of
the
wilcox
case.
there
was
no
evidence
offered
below
and
none
appears
to
show
any
kind
of
reliance
upon
that
decision.
and
so
there
was
no
issue
tendered
for
the
district
court
to
reach
on
that
point.
no
evidence
at
all
was
offered
dealing
with
it,
no
showing
at
all
was
made
of
reliance.
if
that
showing
had
been
made,
we
might
have
a
different
question.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
not
only
is
the
point
not
raised,
there's
no
showing
that
these
tax
returns
were
filed
and
prepared
on
the
basis
of
the
wilcox
decision,
as
a
matter
of
fact
three
of
the
returns
for
the
four
years
in
issue
were
filed
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
rutkin
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
would
say
that
on
the
evidence
that
district
court
properly
found
that
he
intended
to
deprive
--
to
fraud
the
government
here.
he
intended
to
evade
the
tax.
if
the
tax
was
due,
he
intended
to
evade
it
when
he
filed
his
return.
the
district
court
had
ample
evidence
to
render
that
finding
more
than
adequate
evidence
of
the
type
referred
to
by
this
court
in
the
spies
case.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
our
position
would
be
on
that
that
even
if
he
had
shown
at
the
trial,
and
again
i
want
to
emphasize,
he
offered
no
evidence
whatever
dealing
with
reliance
under
wilcox
decision
and
in
fact
three
of
the
tax
returns
here
were
filed
post
rutkin,
but
in
any
event
even
he
had
shown
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
in
our
view
it
did.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
did
not
say
so
explicitly,
but
in
our
view,
it's
an
inescapable
conclusion
that
we
derived
from
the
reasoning
of
the
rutkin
decision.
the
rutkin
case
could
not
have
been
decided
the
way
it
was
decided
had
the
wilcox
criteria
for
taxable
gains
been
applied.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
the
court
in
the
rutkin
case
resorted
to
the
technique
of
overruling
a
decision
by
distinguishing
it
and
we
say
here
that
the
wilcox
rule
has
with
it
a
way
that
the
rutkin
decision
administered
the
mortal
wound
and
since
then
the
lower
courts
have
chipped
away
at
it
and
that
really
there
is
nothing
left
of
the
wilcox
rule
at
all,
and
we're
here
asking
this
court
to
declare
explicitly
that
which
has
been
implicit
and
in
fact
applied
by
the
lower
courts,
ever
since
the
rutkin
case
and
the
rule
applied
by
the
rutkin
case
itself.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
the
way
it
has
turn
out
it
means
mr.
wilcox
specifically.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
say
this
first
that
the
legal
criteria
for
the
determination
of
taxable
income
which
were
set
forth
by
the
court
in
the
rutkin
case
were
really
an
embodiment
of
the
basic
principles
of
determining
gross
income
which
this
court
has
declared
in
many
of
the
earlier
income
tax
cases,
corliss
and
bowers,
helvering
and
hallock,
the
horst
case,
lucas
and
earl,
the
basic
principles
for
the
determination
of
gross
income.
in
our
view,
rutkin
simply
reiterated
them
and
applied
them
in
the
context
of
unlawful
gains
there,
but
the
basic
principle
which
the
rutkin
decision
applied
admits
of
no
exception
for
embezzlement
or
for
any
other
illicit
gains
providing
the
--
those
criteria
are
met,
that
is
the
economic
benefit.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
basis
for
taxation
exists
and
the
lower
courts
have
so
construed
it
ever
since
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
was
going
to
say
where
the
exception
of
the
dix
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact
chief
judge
clark
who
participated
in
bruswitz
case
but
not
the
dix
case
stated
that
in
his
view
rutkin
was
diametrically
opposed
to
the
wilcox
case
and
that
the
circuit
courts
who
had
--
which
had
been
distinguishing
wilcox
were
calling
at
the
process
of
distinguishing
it
out
of
deference
to
this
court
but
that
in
fact
they
had
concluded
as
they
logically
they
could
conclude
that
the
rutkin
case
had
overruled
wilcox.
in
our
view,
there
is
and
can
be
no
distinction
between
embezzlement
and
extortion.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
they
are
both
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
we
say
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
say
that
the
legal
criteria
in
wilcox
and
rutkin
cannot
be
reconciled.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
we
say
that
the
court,
in
effect,
overruled
it.
the
court
distinguished
wilcox
and
at
the
same
time
adopted
legal
criteria
which
resulted
and
in
effect
overruling
the
wilcox
case,
because
if
the
criteria
of
the
rutkin
case
were
to
be
applied
to
an
embezzlement
situation,
the
conclusion
would
be
what
we
submit
the
conclusion
must
be
here
that
is
that
it
is
taxable
income.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
was
about
to
quote
â€“-
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
--that
reference
to
your
honor.
your
honor
has
sentenced
in
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
that's
right.
the
dissenters
in
the
rutkin
case
recognized
explicitly
that
the
court
in
its
majority
opinion
was
rejecting
the
reasoning
of
the
wilcox
decision.
now,
that
process
has
continued
in
the
lower
courts,
the
rule
of
rutkin
which
in
our
view
is
no
more
than
an
affirmation
of
the
basic
principles
of
income
taxation
in
the
earlier
cases
referred
to
in
our
brief.
the
lower
courts
have
continued
in
that
screamed
of
authority.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
there
been
a
host
of
a
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
have
been
--
since
rutkin
there
have
been
many
cases
involving
situations
which,
in
our
view,
wilcox
with
the
law
the
result
would
--
the
conclusion
would
follow
that
there
was
no
income.
in
all
of
those
cases
the
government
urged
that
under
rutkin,
the
proceeds
were
income
in
most
of
those
cases
the
taxpayers
asserted
that
this
was
embezzlement
situation
and
under
wilcox
they
would
go
free
or
that
they
did
not
require
to
report
those
proceeds.
government,
in
the
trade,
uniformly
took
the
position
that
rutkin
was
the
law
and
that
under
rutkin
criteria
the
proceeds
in
question,
whether
they
are
from
embezzlement,
from
kickbacks,
from
commercial
bribes
or
from
any
source,
whatever,
that
under
the
rutkin
criteria
the
conclusion
must
follow
that
taxable
income
existed.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
in
our
view
he's
been
entitled
to
a
deduction.
he
should
be
given
no
more
benefit
in
that
regard
than
this
court
has
already
declared
for
the
honest
taxpayer.
when
the
honest
taxpayer
receives
salable
gains,
he
must
report
them
in
income
when
he
receives
them.
he
is
thereafter,
if
then
determined
that
he
must
repay
them,
entitled
to
a
deduction.
we
say
here
that
the
embezzler
is
entitled
to
no
better
treatment
from
this
court
that
he
must
report
to
proceeds
when
he
receives
them,
when
and
if
he
pays
them
back
and
i
might
add
parenthetically
that
there
are
all
the
three
quarters
of
a
million
dollars
embezzled
here
of
the
taxpayer
settled
for
$13,000,
he
repaid
13
somewhat
thousand
dollars
what
became
of
over
$700,000
and
nobody
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
has
to
do
with
the
tax
question
and
that
is
our
basic
position
that
the
man
who
receives
illicit
gain
should
be
treated
and
precisely
the
same
way
as
the
man
who
receives
gains
from
an
honest
source.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
details
of
that
litigation
your
honor.
we
say
here
that
the
wilcox
rule
is
a
judicially
declared
rule.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
and
we
are
here
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
there
is
no
--
in
our
view
there
is
no
basis
in
the
bare
statutory
language
here
to
distinguish
licit
and
illicit
gains
to
the
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
i
think
without
a
specific
factual
example
i
would
have
difficulty
responding
in
the
generality
of
cases
i
would
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
would
say
that
if
the
--
is
that
which
is
acquired
is
treated
by
the
taxpayer
as
his
own
so
that
he
can
--
he
has
such
control
all
over
it
that
he
derived
as
the
readily
realizable
economic
benefit
that
he
would
receive
a
gain
within
the
meaning
of
the
code.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
a
gain
because
under
those
circumstances,
he's
treating
the
proceeds
as
his
own
and
he
has
that
control
and
dominion
from
which
he
derives
the
economic
benefit.
he
has
an
accession
to
wealth.
this
court
in
glenshaw
glass
case
when
it
was
faced
with
the
argument
that
the
proceeds
there
the
windfall
didn't
derive
from
conventional
labor
or
capital,
and
therefore,
could
not
constitute
income.
and
this
court
said,
we're
not
--
the
question
of
income
is
not
controlled
by
labels
or
by
sources,
it
is
a
question
of
economic
benefit,
if
the
taxpayer
has
an
accession
to
wealth.
as
we
say
the
embezzler
clearly
has
--
he
has
income.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
has
income.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
if
your
honor
is
referring
to
case
of
the
embezzler,
it's
our
position
essentially
the
embezzler
does
not
keep
books.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
owes
it
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
--
he
owes
it
in
a
different
way
if
your
honor
please,
he
owes
it
by
operation
of
law.
he
owes
it
by
the
imposition
of
a
legal
--
of
an
obligation
by
law
which
he
does
not
acknowledge
to
which
he
does
not
agree.
it's
not
a
consensual
transaction.
we
would
draw
the
same
distinction
this
court
ruled
in
the
healy
case
where
it
was
faced
with
an
argument
by
a
taxpayer
that
because
the
taxpayer
held
the
funds
on
a
constructive
trust
and
there
he
had
received
them
by
a
conveyance
and
fraud
of
predators,
because
he
held
the
funds
on
a
constructive
trust,
he
should
be
treated
as
an
express
trustee
and
clearly
an
express
trustee
does
not
realized
personal
income
when
he
receives
trust
proceeds.
well,
this
court
held
in
the
unanimous
opinion
the
case
of
the
constructive
trustee
is
clearly
different
from
the
case
of
the
express
trustee.
the
express
trustee
does
not
retain
the
proceeds
for
his
own
use
and
benefit.
he
does
not
realize
the
accession
to
wealth.
on
the
other
hand
the
constructive
trustee
simply
asserts
that
the
property
is
his
own,
he
realizes
the
benefit,
he
claims
the
control.
the
constructive
just
a
legal
fiction,
which
cannot
control
the
economic
basis
for
the
finding
of
gain
under
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no.
this
court
has
held
in
many
of
the
earlier
cases
that
the
common
law
concepts
of
title
and
the
technicalities
of
common
law
property
concepts
do
not
control.
taxpayers
have
been
held
to
have
realized
income
for
proceeds
which
never
came
into
their
hands
where
they
are
assigned
them
in
anticipation
of
ever
receiving
them.
taxpayers
have
been
held
to
realize
income
where
they
turnover
funds
in
trust
and
where
they
could
receive
no
income
from
the
trust,
nevertheless
that
those
payments
paid
out
of
the
trust
have
been
held
to
be
income
to
the
taxpayer.
we
say
those
are
all
in
the
general
line
of
the
cases
which
hold
that
the
question
of
gains
or
income
is
a
practical
one
based
upon
economic
benefit
to
the
taxpayer.
the
code
itself
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
it
is
a
general
principle
that
amounts
which
have
been
included
in
income
when
they
--
thereafter
restored,
one
is
entitled
to
an
offsetting
deduction.
this
court
so
held
in
the
lewis
case
where
a
man
received
salary
payments
which
were
erroneously
computed.
he
received
too
much.
he
was
held
there
that
he
must
nevertheless
return
those
excessive
payments
as
income
in
the
year
of
receipt
and
that
when
he
returns
those
funds,
he
was
entitled
to
a
deduction
in
the
year
of
repayment.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
we
would
say
in
that
case,
there
was
an
offsetting
transaction.
i
mean
the
annual
account
--
assuming
that
this
was
with
the
same
annual
accounting
period,
it
would
be
an
offsetting
transaction.
there
would
be
no
net
income
realized
in
that
transaction.
he
would
not
have
an
accession
to
wealth
which
is
the
basic
formulation
that
we
rely
upon
here.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
he
can
be
granted
such
a
deduction
since
we're
requiring
reported
an
income
we
feel
that
he's
entitled
to
a
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
think
that
is
this
court
has
held
and
the
lower
courts
have
held
that
moral
turpitude
is
not
a
touchstone
of
taxability.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
well,
this
court
decided
the
sullivan
case
whereas
my
recollection
is
it
was
rents
paid
in
connection
with
an
illegal
gambling
enterprise.
this
court
held
those
rents
were
deductible.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
your
honor,
by
the
time
of
rutkin?
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
if
your
honor
please,
we
think
that
the
wilcox
case
was
a
departure
from
established
fundamental
principle
from
that
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
i
just
--
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
arguments
which
were
made
to
the
court
in
those
cases.
our
position
has
been
the
court
in
the
wilcox
case
entered
upon
a
legal
standard
which
represented
a
departure
from
these
fundamental
principles
and
that
when
the
matter
came
before
the
court
again
in
rutkin,
it
recognized
that.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
that
is
our
position
here.
this
is
a
self
reassessment
system
and
we
think
that
all
taxpayers
are
entitled
to
know
that
they
are
being
treated
similarly
across
the
broad
to
the
man
in
the
street,
mr.
james
who
has
over
$700,000
unaccounted
for
realized
income
or
gain
in
the
very
practical
sense
he
realized
that
in
the
popular
sense
which
mr.
justice
homes
had
said
these
words
should
be
construed.
he
realized
income
and
it's
our
position
that
across
the
board
when
the
basic
tasks
of
economic
benefit
are
met
that
the
result
is
taxable
income.
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
the
treasury
has
--
through
the
process
--
mr.
howard
a.
heffron
no,
the
treasury
has
not
gone
to
congress.
it
has
chosen
the
litigation
route,
and
after
the
rutkin
case
the
treasury
believed
that
in
fact
it
had
succeeded
and
is
now
asking
the
court
to
declare
and
make
explicit
what
we
believe
has
been
in
fact
the
case
ever
since
the
rutkin
decision
that
is
that
wilcox
is
no
longer
law
and
that
embezzled
funds
are
income
just
as
any
of
the
unlawful
gains
or
honest
gains.
mr.
howard

no,
there's
a
finding
of
embezzlement
here.
we
think
the

squarely
present
