turned
out,

plenary
right
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
universally
true,
is
it,
the
dix
case
in
the
second
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
heffron,
you
stated
told
us
earlier
i
think
that
if
this
man
were
to
make
a
restitution
that
you
can
see
he'd
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
in
the
year
that
he
made
restitution
on,
and
what
section
of
the
code
would
that
be?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
care
about
the
section
but
i
just
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
heffron,
you
don't
think
that
the
facts
in
this
case
are
distinguishable
in
the
wilcox
manner?
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
wilcox
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
they
generally
held
that
the
facts
didn't
show
embezzlement?
