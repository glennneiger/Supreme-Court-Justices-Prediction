mr.
gorman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
principal,
what
is
the
difference
between
embezzlement
and
extortion
so

in
this
context?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
any
court
had
two
cases,
one
of
embezzlement
and
one
of
extortion
would,
under
the
same
circumstances,
order
restitution
from
the
embezzler
and
not
from
the
extortionist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
does
that
change
the
principle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood.

don't
think
that

don't
think
that

and
wilcox
are

conflict

each
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren

they
are
consistent?
