justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kiendl,
you
indicated
that
these
questions
--
that
the
claim
was
partly
based
on
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
merely
the
--
the
new
york
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
just
--
just
reading
his
under
faith?
i
don't
think
quite
see
that
these
--
on
the
faith
of
the
subject
matter
of
these
questions
related
to
--
to
potential
federal
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
--
am
i
to
infer
from
that
that
you
are
arguing
or
at
least
assuming
that
the
fifth
amendment
is
to
be
read
into
the
fourteenth?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
repeat
my
question.
on
the
face
of
it,
the
things
that
you
--
the
subject
matter
of
the
questions
that
you
read
from
--
on
page
7
of
the
respondent's
brief,
they
don't
obviously
seem
to
me
to
relate
any
danger
of
being
prosecuted
on
any
federal
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
given
by
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
given
by
the
state
constitution
as
well
as
the
federal
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
and
my
--
well,
i
can
understand
that
--
that
he
brings
himself
under
jeopardy
under
the
state
guarantee
--
against
self-incrimination.
i
don't
--
under
faith
that
they
see
how
he
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
go
ahead.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
have
--
could
he
not
have
invoke
the
same
privilege
before
the
grand
jury
--
in
refusing
to
answer
grand
jury
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
hurley
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judge
--
judge
fuld
refers
to
is
the
culkin
case,
which
all
of
us
new
york
lawyers
well
know
in
saying
that
their
--
that
cooperation
is
a
requisite
because
the
lawyer's
duty
was
subject
to
his
right
to
claim
privilege.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
that
i
put
it
to
you
is
because
that
case
--
in
that
case,
he
laid
out
a
rather
comprehensive
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
culkin,
you
might
also
say,
of
course,
that's
a
new
york
state
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
--
even
assuming
--
even
assuming
that
they
could
--
chief
judge
cardozo's
statement,
they're
literally.
he
was
talking
about
the
claims
that
could
be
made
under
new
york's
--
under
the
new
york
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
federal
question
didn't
come
into
play
there
at
all,
did
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
until
relatively
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
recently.
there
is
(inaudible)
i
forgot
to
what
within
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
until
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
only
within
my
--
my
lifetime
which
is
an
age
but
--
but
much
more
recently
within
the
lifetime
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
hurley,
in
answer
to
your
--
in
answer
to
justice
harlan's
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
there's
a
federal
question
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
--
you
don't
think
there's
a
solid
federal
question
but
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
did
consider
whether
what
was
done
here
violated
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
other
words
--
did
mr.
kiendl
argue
the
case
there?
in
other
words,
he
raised
that
question
that
under
the
fourteenth,
it's
violative
of
a
due
process
because
--
possibly
because
of
the
dilemma
to
which
justice
brennan
called
attention.
they
said
we
did
consider
whether
putting
a
lawyer
in
that
kind
of
crouch,
that
kind
of
dilemma
is
--
comes
within
the
general
conceptions
of
due
process.
so
what
you
mean
is
you
don't
think
there's
a
substantial
federal
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
comes
here
on
the
most
authoritative
pronouncement
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
passed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
you're
arguing
but
they
did
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we
have
before
us
the
federal
question.
we
passed
on
it
by
rejecting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
can't
be
very
heavy.
what
you
said
a
minute
ago
is
correct.
this
is
the
first
lawyer
who
refused
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are
--
they
are
all
subject
to
the
schedule
of
peace
that
the
right
provision
has
promulgated,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
that
--
that's
settled
now.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow.
that
means
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
stood.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
they're
all
subject
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
as
i
remember
that
the
inherent
charge
more
than
50%
unless
in
an
ad
hoc
proceeding,
the
circumstances
plead
the
appellate
division
to
make
an
exception,
is
that
right?
