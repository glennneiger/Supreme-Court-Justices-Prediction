mr.
theodore
kiendl
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
which
affirmed
an
order
of
the
appellate
division
in
the
second
department
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
disbarring
the
petitioner
from
the
further
practice
of
the
law.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
opinion
of
that
court
was
written
by
the
chief
judge.
there
was
one
dissent
in
a
separate
opinion
by
judge
fuld
in
the
appellate
division
of
the
second
department
where
the
disciplinary
proceeding
originates
in
which
had
power
and
control
over
the
bar.
the
opinion
was
written
by
mr.
justice
baldock
and
there
was
one
dissent
by
mr.
justice
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
theodore
kiendl
--
mr.
justice
kleinfeld
--
and
an
indication
by
the
presiding
justice
in
the
concurring
opinion
with
the
--
the
court's
opinions
that
he
entertained
some
reluctance
in
reaching
the
conclusion
to
go
with
the
majority
in
that
case.
now,
the
amended
remittitur
shows
clearly,
as
we
see
it,
that
the
federal
constitutional
question
was
raised
and
necessarily
disposed
off
in
the
court
of
appeals.
your
honors
will
see
at
page
96
of
the
transcript
of
record,
the
amendment
to
the
remittitur
in
which
it
was
stated
amongst
other
things
that
upon
the
appeal
herein,
they
were
presented
and
necessarily
passed
upon
questions
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
quoting
them
and
then
concluding
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
rights
of
appellant,
petitioner
here,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
not
been
violated.
now,
our
case
is
somewhat
different
from
the
two
cases
that
proceeded
and
that
there's
nothing
here
involving
any
question
about
communist
membership,
subversive
activities
or
anything
of
that
kind,
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
this
is
a
case
involving
an
attorney.
and
the
facts
are
virtually
uncontradicted
and
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned,
we
think
conceded.
we
may
draw
different
inferences
from
some
of
the
facts
but
essentially,
the
basic
term
and
the
facts
in
this
case
are
undisputed.
and
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
briefly
summarize
them.
the
petitioner
was
admitted
to
practice
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
year
1922,
almost
38
years
ago.
he
specialized
in
the
practice
of
negligence
law,
taking
personal
injury
cases
and
death
cases
on
contingency
basis.
and
he
continued
that
practice
right
up
to
the
time
that
this
disbarment
order
was
entered
a
year
or
so
ago
since
it's
been
stayed
by
an
order
of
this
court.
now,
in
the
course
of
his
practice,
he
was
compelled
under
the
rules
of
that
court
improperly
to
file
statements
of
the
retainers
that
he
accepted
in
these
personal
injury
cases.
if
you'll
entertain
more
than
five
such
cases
in
a
year,
you
had
to
file
written
reports
with
the
appellate
division
and
this
was
done
--
and
this
record
shows
that
during
the
course
of
a
period
of
five
years
from
1954
to
1958
inclusive,
he
had
filed
some
300
of
retainers
or
an
average
of
some
60
a
year
in
this
specialty
in
which
he
was
engaged.
there
came
a
time
when
the
appellate
division
in
the
second
department
for
reasons
that
we're
satisfactory
to
it,
ordered
a
judicial
inquiry
into
practices
existing
in
the
bar
and
the
borough
of
brooklyn,
the
county
of
kings.
those
practices
we
might
call
"ambulance
chasing"
practices
for
want
of
a
better
word.
and
the
inquiry
started
in
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
served
on
this
petitioner.
subpoena
called
for
the
production
of
all
his
books
and
records
pertaining
to
these
retainers.
it
also
called
for
his
attendants
as
a
witness.
and
he
attended
before
there
was
inquiry
which
was
being
conducted
by
an
additional
special
term
of
the
supreme
court
but
had
been
delegated
for
that
purpose
by
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court.
he
attended
and
was
asked
various
questions.
he
was
asked
to
produce
his
books
and
records
including
his
bank
accounts
and
things
of
that
kind.
he
was
asked
some
60
different
questions,
touching
along
and
relevant
to
unquestionably
the
professional
--
his
professional
conduct
in
some
of
these
retainer
cases.
there's
no
doubt
the
relevancy
of
the
question,
and
no
doubt
about
the
propriety
of
the
injury.
but
he
took
the
position
on
the
advice
of
able
and
experienced
counsel.
and
in
the
utmost
good
faith
that
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york,
he
was
entitled
not
to
become
a
witness
against
himself,
treated
the
doctrine
--
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination,
refuse
to
answer,
refuse
to
produce
these
records.
now,
the
only
answered
questions
were
of
this
nature
and
i
summarized
them
from
the
respondent's
brief,
page
7.
the
only
answered
questions
related
to
the
identity
of
his
law
office,
partners
and
so
forth
to
his
possession
of
the
record,
to
any
possible
destruction
of
the
records
to
his
bank
accounts,
to
his
paying
off
police
officers,
caught
or
prison
employees
to
his
paying
insurance
company
employees
and
promising
to
pay
the
laid
persons
10%
of
recoveries
or
settlements.
that
was
the
type
of
questions
that
were
answered,
that
he
refused
to
answer.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
no
question
about
it
at
all.
it
was
based
--
mr.
theodore
kiendl
in
the
amendment
to
the
remittitur,
if
i
may
quote
it
rather
than
attend
to
paraphrase
it,
your
honor,
which
appears
at
page
96
with
this
record.
the
statement
is
made
upon
the
appeal
herein.
they
were
presented
and
necessarily
passed
upon
questions
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
appellant
asserted
that
his
disbarment
based
solely
upon
his
reliance
in
good
faith
and
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
a
nonadversary
proceeding
without
any
substantive
charges
of
misconduct
being
made
or
proven
against
him
at
a
full
hearing
where
the
right
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination
of
witnesses
and
full
and
ample
defenses
would
be
available
was
violated
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
his
disbarment
based
on
his
assertion
in
good
faith
of
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
the
appellate
division
held
constituted
or
refusal
to
cooperate
with
the
court
and
a
breach
of
the
canon
of
ethics
violated
his
guarantees
of
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
rights
of
appellant
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
not
been
violated.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
no,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
well,
if
your
honor
please,
our
position
is
this.
that
the
question
of
which
is
essentially
presented
here
is
this.
did
the
state
violate
due
process?
in
summarily,
disbarring
an
attorney
from
the
further
practice
of
his
profession,
who
relies
on
his
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
against
self-incrimination
--
mr.
theodore
kiendl
--
in
good
faith.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
unquestionably,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
not
at
all.
entirely,
the
personal
injury
negligence
cases
--
mr.
theodore
kiendl
--
which
he
specialized.
we
submit
that
that
is
the
one
and
the
sole
question
and
the
narrow
question
presented
to
this
court.
and
we
submit
that
due
process
was
violated
in
this
case
by
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
the
courts
of
his
right
to
censor,
suspend,
disbar
and
so
forth
members
of
the
bar.
now,
we
must
admit
very
frankly
to
this
court
that
neither
the
respondents
nor
the
court
below
agreed
with
us
on
a
court
that
that
was
the
simple
question
presented.
the
court
below
took
an
entirely
different
view
of
it
in
one
which
we
think
was
wholly
unjustified.
it
was
arbitrary,
that
was
capricious
that
one
had
no
rational
basis
to
support
it.
the
court
below
--
the
respondent
below
went
off
into
this
line
of
reasoning.
say
they,
"here
is
a
lawyer
who,
from
the
very
time
that
he's
admitted
to
practice
law,
owes
the
absolute
and
vital
duty
to
the
court,
to
the
public,
to
the
bar
of
frankness
and
candor
in
full
cooperation,
that
he's
entitled
to
every
constitutional
right
including
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
when
he
took
the
position
that
he
will
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination,
he
was
perfectly
within
his
rights.
he
has
the
absolute
right.
he
has
the
perfect
right
to
plea
that
privilege.
but
he
did
so
at
the
parallel,
at
the
danger
of
committing
professional
suicide,
that's
what
it
was
tantamount
to.
of
course,
i'm
familiar
with
the
decisions
of
the
courts.
the
disbarment
of
an
attorney
is
not
punishment.
i'm
familiar
with
the
fact
that
it's
not
a
penalty
of
forfeiture
in
the
accepted
sense.
but
the
consequences
to
the
disbarred
lawyer,
is
just
as
bad
as
if
he
cuts
his
own
professional
growth.
now,
they
say
that
the
attorney
who
comes
before
a
judicial
inquiry
into
ambulance
chasing
and
refuses
to
answer
this
type
of
question
does
not
possess
the
character
and
fitness
to
the
requisite
for
admission
to
the
bar
in
the
state
of
new
york.
and
that
his
complete
cooperation
must
be
continuously
given
as
long
as
he
remembers
--
remains
a
member
of
that
profession.
we
think
the
situation
has
summed
up
succinctly
and
completely
in
one
sentence
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
justice
kleinfeld
there
stated,
and
i
read
from
page
96.
i'm
afraid
i
have
the
wrong
page,
your
honor.
i'll
find
it
in
just
a
minute.
sorry,
it
takes
so
long.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
77?
mr.
theodore
kiendl
yes,
it
should
be
page
77.
and
i
have
it
now.
mr.
justice
kleinfeld
there
said,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
"despite
all
disclaimers
to
the
contrary,
respondent
is
being
disbarred
for
pleading
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination."
and
we
say
there's
no
escape
from
that
conclusion
when
this
record
is
read
by
this
court.
that's
the
one
and
the
only
reason
why
he
was
disbarred.
they
call
it
a
refusal
to
answer
questions
--
but
the
refusal
to
answer
questions
were
implicitly
the
invocation
of
the
constitutional
right
against
self-incrimination.
they
are
so
unutterably
and
inextricably
interwoven
that
they
are
substantially
one
in
the
same
thing.
and
to
say
that
a
member
of
the
bar
may
exercise
a
constitutional
right
not
to
become
a
witness
against
themselves
should
be
disbarred
ipso
facto
per
se
for
taking
that
position
to
us
seems
to
be
entirely
wrong
and
it's
a
denial
of
due
process
and
an
arbitrary
denial
which
warrants
the
intervention
of
this
court
to
correct
that
situation.
now,
what
do
they
say
about
the
consequences
that
would
ensue?
they
predict
that
dire
consequences
would
happen
if
a
lawyer
in
the
position
of
this
petitioner
were
permitted
to
standby,
refused
to
answer
questions,
refused
to
produce
records
that
it
would
hobble
and
prejudice
and
impair
the
possibility
of
the
court
through
its
duly
accredited
agent,
the
supreme
court
additional
special
time,
from
cleaning
the
professional
house
impertinently
from
ensuring
the
non-existence
of
illegal
practices,
unethical
practices
that
this
court
would
be
stopped,
powerless,
impotent
is
the
word
that
they
used
in
once
sense.
we
say
that's
not
at
all
so.
and
that's
merely
driving
a
red
herring
across
the
trail.
there
were
two
avenues
of
approach
that
were
available
to
this
inquiry
that
they
could
have
used
and
used
effectively
without
going
through
this
summary
process
of
disbarment
solely
for
the
exercise
of
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
privilege.
the
two
things
they
could've
done
was
this.
when
he
was
called
before
the
committee
--
i'm
sorry,
i
said
committee.
i
was
thinking
of
the
last
case,
called
before
the
--
the
inquiry.
he
was
told
that
this
was
not
an
adversary
proceeding,
that
he
was
not
a
defendant,
that
he
was
not
a
respondent
that
he
was
not
being
charged
with
anything.
but
that,
the
inquiry
had
in
its
possession
information
which
indicated
his
participation
in
professional
misconduct,
that's
what
he
was
told.
and
when
he
was
confronted
with
that
information,
he
took
the
position
he
did
take.
now,
if
the
inquiry
had
that
information
and
it
was
available,
they
were
empowered
and
authorized
and
had
full
authority
to
go
along
with
the
proposition
of
bringing
a
disciplinary
proceeding
against
the
petitioner,
trying
it
in
use
--
usual
way
and
plenary
fashion
giving
him
all
the
safeguards
that
he
was
entitled
to
under
the
due
process
clause
and
protect
the
court,
the
bar
and
the
public
against
these
very
dire
consequences
that
they
have
predicted
to
be
otherwise
in
the
suit.
but
they
had
an
even
more
important
possibility.
in
connection
with
the
inquiry
that
was
being
conducted
by
this
addition
of
special
time,
they
were
parallel
with
that
inquiry,
grand
jury
proceedings.
and
in
the
grand
jury
proceedings,
this
petitioner
could've
been
called
by
serving
him
with
a
subpoena
to
appear
before
a
grand
jury
and
compel
to
answer
questions
of
the
very
character
which
were
asked
in
--
at
this
inquiry,
compelled
to
produce
the
very
documents.
would
he
--
they
asked
him
to
produce
under
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
at
the
inquiry.
and
if
he
refuse
to
answer
those
questions
and
refuse
to
produce
those
documents,
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
beyond
any
doubt,
he
would've
been
in
contempt
if
he
refused
to
answer.
he
would've
been
subject
to
imprisonment.
he
would've
been
subject
to
disciplinary
process.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
he
could,
your
honor,
but
if
the
grand
jury
gave
him
complete
immunity
as
they
did
and
do,
then
he
was
in
the
position
that
i've
outlined.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
this
wasn't
really
a
civil
manner
and
they
accept
the
sentence,
but
in
any
event,
the
grand
jury
was
used
in
this
very
investigation,
in
this
particular
matter,
not
as
against
this
particular
petitioner
but
as
against
other,
and
we
cite
the
case
that
i'm
coming
to
later,
in
re
cioffi,
i
think
it's
pronounced,
c-i-o-f-f-i,
where
the
grand
jury
did
ask
questions
to
the
man
who
was
somewhat
in
similar
situation.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
we
maintain
that
under
the
situation
that
existed
in
this
case,
this
particular
inquiry
set
up
by
the
appellate
division
whom
we're
dealing
of
an
additional
special
time,
had
the
right
to
be
paneled
the
grand
jury
to
make
such
investigation
that
was
necessary
and
that
it
did
serve
in
this
particular
situation
in
cleaning
its
own
house,
in
awarding
his
dire
consequences
and
continue
ambulance
chasing,
solicitations,
payment
of
fee,
(inaudible),
and
things
of
that
kind.
i'll
mention
that
case
a
little
later
on
if
i
may
your
honor
but
i'll
try
definitely
not
to
forget
it.
now,
if
those
disastrous
consequences
were
not
ensued,
we
realize
that
we're
not
using
lawfully
expression
home
free
at
all.
we're
still
met
with
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
seem
so
extensively
argued
both
orally
and
in
writing
in
the
last
two
or
three
years.
i
refer
to
the
line
of
cases
beginning
with
lerner,
running
through
bilo
--
beilan,
and
nelson,
and
globe,
and
cases
of
that
character.
all
those
cases
had
been
argued
today,
cases
that
arose
under
states
statutes
or
constitutions.
there,
the
refusal
to
answer,
were
despite
statutory
legislative
enactments
requiring
the
employees,
the
public
employees
to
give
answer
to
those
questions
at
the
pain
of
dismissal.
and
we
say
that
they're
radically
different.
it's
been
argued
here
this
afternoon
from
the
situation
involved
so
far
as
an
attorney
is
concerned.
and
we
not
only
say
that,
but
we
say
there's
respectable
authority
sustaining
it.
we
think
it's
implicit
in
the
decision
of
this
--
this
court
in
those
very
sharply
divided
opinions
that
the
basis,
the
inherent
basis
of
the
decision
sustaining
the
dismissal
of
the
teacher,
of
the
policeman,
of
the
subway
worker
was
all
because
of
the
relationship
of
master
and
servant,
employer
or
an
employee.
and
we
cite
three
cases
that
we
think
squarely
support
that
from
other
courts.
first,
we
cite
the
case,
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
where
that
court
was
asked
by
the
legislature
of
that
state
to
render
an
advisory
opinion
i'm
about
to
propose
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
proposed
bill
that
made
it
mandatory,
give
authority
to
dismiss
teachers,
both
public
and
private,
if
they
refuse
to
answer
questions
regarding
communistic
or
sub
--
subversive
activity.
and
in
that
case,
unanimous,
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
decided
that
it
would
be
definitely
unconstitutional
if
private
teachers
were
brought
into
the
same
category
with
public
teachers.
that
--
the
two
situations
were
radically
different.
and
they
used
the
word
"perfectly
obvious".
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
the
cases
were
different.
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
courts
refused
to
disbar
a
lawyer
who
took
the
advantage
of
his
constitutional
privilege
and
differentiated
that
case
from
the
case
of
a
policeman,
public
employee.
and
in
the
famous
case
of
sheiner
in
florida,
a
situation
almost
analogous
to
this
case
at
bar,
was
presented
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
to
refuse
to
disbar
a
lawyer
who
took
advantage
of
one
of
his
constitutional
rights.
and
after
the
case
was
originally
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
this
court
decided
the
cases
that
i've
referred
to.
and
on
the
petition
of
the
bar
association,
supreme
court
of
florida
was
asked
to
review
its
decision
in
the
sheiner
case
in
the
light
of
the
impact
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
it
did
review
its
decisions
in
the
former
case,
its
decision
in
the
former
case
in
the
light
of
the
decisions
here
and
reached
precisely
and
exactly
the
same
conclusion
that
this
court's
rulings
on
those
cases
were
not
finding
on
an
attorney
who
took
advantage
of
the
constitutional
privilege.
there
were
two
more
matters
that
i
want
to
refer
to
and
i
should
start.
you
cite
the
gray
and
ellis
cases
in
the
appellate
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
we
were
entitled
to
take
advantage
of
our
constitutional
rights
even
as
a
lawyer.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
by
its
chief
judge
rather
apologetically
referred
to
those
cases
as
we
read
his
opinion.
he
said
this,
and
i
read
from
page
87.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
87.
the
appellant's
reliances
on
matter
of
gray
and
matter
of
ellis,
matter
of
sullivan
and
matter
of
coffenberg,
the
four
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york.
none
of
those
decisions
control
us
here.
the
precise
question
in
gray
and
ellis
was
as
to
whether
a
lawyer
who
offered
to
answer
all
pertinent
questions
could
be
compelled
in
such
an
investigation
to
waive
immunity
and
advance
a
question.
the
holding
in
each
case
was
that
the
lawyer,
like
every
other
citizen,
is
constitutionally
privileged
not
to
answer
damaging
question.
the
difference
between
those
cases
and
the
present
one
may
seem
slight
but
it
is
enough
to
permit
a
fresh
examination
of
the
question
now
directly
presented.
we
think
when
your
honor
reads
the
decision
in
those
cases,
you
will
see
that
the
distinction,
the
difference
was
not
slight
that
there
was
no
real
substantive
difference
between
those
cases
and
the
case
at
bar.
here
is
the
situation
that
has
tremendous
importance
to
all
members
of
the
bar
everywhere.
it's
a
case
of
far-reaching
effect
that's
tantamount
if
this
court
sustained
the
decision
of
the
state
courts
to
a
holding
that
the
state
can
compel
lawyers
to
be
witnesses
against
themselves.
it
is
tantamount
to
a
holding
that
a
lawyer
is
not
a
citizen
the
same
as
every
other
citizen
in
the
united
states
but
as
one
court
below
said
assumption,
a
second
grade
citizen.
is
respondent
taking
the
position?
the
respondent
taking
the
position
on
the
other
hand
that
lawyers
or
super
citizens,
that
they're
"citizens
plus"
is
the
expression
that
they
used
and
they're
held
to
a
much
higher
state
of
answerability
or
responsibility
than
the
school
teacher
or
the
subway
employee.
all
this
regardless
of
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
so
far
as
this
record,
it
appears,
here
is
a
lawyer
of
exemplary
character
until
this
situation
came
up
for
37
years,
a
lawyer
who
has
an
unblemished
record
at
the
bar,
a
lawyer
who
has
been
a
legislature
--
legislator,
a
lawyer
who
was
running
for
judicial
office
and
has
been
endorsed
as
qualified
after
these
things
had
happened
by
three
major
bar
associations
of
the
city
of
new
york.
now,
we
say
that
in
that
situation,
it
was
nothing
short
of
being
arbitrary
for
the
state
courts
to
disbar
him
for
exercising
his
constitutional
rights.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
one
case
that
i
wanted
to
refer
to
because
of
a
question
that
has
asked
me
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
and
that
is
the
cioffi
case.
at
page
8
of
our
reply
brief,
we
discussed
that
case
somewhat.
in
the
cioffi
case,
cioffi
was
called
before
a
grand
jury,
as
i
have
indicated,
in
connection
with
this
judicial
investigation
in
the
ambulance
chasing
and
took
the
position
that
he
would
refuse
to
answer
questions
because
of
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
granted
the
full
immunity
that
he
was
entitled
to.
the
courts
disagreed
with
him.
and
he
was
held
in
contempt.
he
took
the
case
in
the
appellate
division.
the
appellate
division
sustained
the
lower
court.
he
took
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
lower
court
and
held
the
grand
jury
had
given
him
full
immunity,
everything
that
he
was
entitled
to
by
a
pleading
to
defend
himself
--
the
privilege
of
self-incrimination.
we
cite
that
case
as
authority
for
a
proposition
on
that
page
and
the
respondent
says,
"that's
not
so
at
all,
that
we're
citing
a
case
which
completely
demolishes
our
thesis."
at
page
8
of
our
reply
brief
we
referred
to
it.
that
is
the
case
of
in
re
cioffi.
and
he
says
that
as
result
of
the
position
taken
by
cioffi
in
that
case,
the
district
attorney
was
blocked
as
--
the
inquiry
was
blocked
in
this
case
quite
the
contrary
as
the
fact.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
cioffi
case,
when
that
case
went
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
determined
that
he
had
gotten
full
immunity
in
the
grand
jury
proceeding.
mr.
cioffi
came
back
and
testified
and
testified
fully
and
i
think
he's
even
now
testifying
in
the
course
of
this
inquiry
so
that
the
dire
prediction
of
what
would
happen
if
they
resorted
to
grand
jury
proceedings
in
that
case,
it's
just
the
opposite
of
what
they
contend.
now,
we
conclude
with
just
this
statement.
and
i
want
to
attempt
to
paraphrase
the
very
language
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
the
schware
case.
mr.
theodore
kiendl
schware,
s
--
i
think,
it's
pronounced
schware,
s-c-h-w-a-r-e.
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
i'll
find
it
in
just
a
second.
i
seem
to
have
trouble
finding
the
right
brief."
to
hold
as
the
court
did
that
communist
affiliation
for
six
to
seven
years
up
to
1940,
15
years
prior
to
the
court's
assessment
of
it,
in
and
off
itself
made
the
petitioner
a
person
with
questionable
character
is
so
dogmatic
in
inference
as
to
be
wholly
unwarranted."
paraphrasing
that
language
to
the
situation
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
the
whole
as
the
courts
below
did
that
the
exercise
of
a
guarantee,
constitutional
privilege
in
and
of
itself
made
the
petitioner
forfeit
his
right
to
practice
law
is
so
dogmatic
in
inference
as
to
be
wholly
unwarranted.
we
submit
that
this
decision
below
was
wrong
that
it
should
be
reversed
by
this
court.
