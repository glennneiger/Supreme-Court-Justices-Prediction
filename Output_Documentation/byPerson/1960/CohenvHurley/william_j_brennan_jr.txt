justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hurley,
may
i
ask
now,
if
he
talks
a
--
his
evidence
proves
to
be
incriminatory
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
then
to
indict
and
prosecute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
rather
a
dilemma,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
doesn't
talk,
he
is
disbarred.
if
he
does
talk,
he
goes
to
jail
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
still
isn't
constitutional
in
my
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
hurley.
this
--
perhaps
it's
not
really
irrelevant
but
--
that
his
--
does
the
practice
in
new
york
automatically
to
disbar
on
conviction
of
a
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
a
felony.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
take
it
some
of
these
questions
might
have
--
it
leads
to
conduct
which
would
have
constituted
felony.
