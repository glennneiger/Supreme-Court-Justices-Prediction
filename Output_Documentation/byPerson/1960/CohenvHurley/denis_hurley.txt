mr.
denis
hurley
i'm
sure
that'll
create
no
problem
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
connection
with
mr.
kiendl's
leaving
yesterday
i
said
i
would
readily
consent
to
what
he
did
say
that
he
wished
he
could
stay
here
to
hear
my
argument
so
he
could
keep
me
within
the
bounds
of
fairness
but
he
said
if
he
left,
he
felt
that
i
would
have
to
even
more
fair
because
this
court
would
move
and
then
protect
him.
this
is
the
fifth
time
that
a
problem
arising
in
this
judicial
inquiry
in
kings
county,
new
york
has
come
before
this
court,
the
second
time
that
oral
argument
has
been
permitted.
therefore,
i
--
i
mention
that
because
i
think
therefore
i
need
not
dwell
on
the
nature
of
this
judicial
inquiry
or
its
scope
or
its
purpose.
indeed,
i
think
mr.
kiendl
yesterday
made
a
very
fair
summary
statement
of
the
background
of
the
inquiry
and
of
the
facts
in
this
particular
case.
in
the
light
of
yesterday's
argument
by
mr.
kiendl,
i
think
there
are
just
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on
and
--
and
clear
up.
one,
the
appellate
division
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
the
court
that's
vested
with
a
plenary
power
by
statute
and
inherent
power
as
--
as
it
has
been
ruled
over
the
admission
and
the
discipline
of
lawyers.
and
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
say
in
answer
to
a
question
that
was
asked
yesterday
that
the
appellate
division
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
grand
jury,
nothing
to
do
with
any
grand
jury
investigation.
it
has
no
power
to
impanel
a
grand
jury
or
to
direct
a
criminal
investigation.
that
in
new
york
and
particularly
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
kings
county
is
for
the
county
court
which
has
criminal
jurisdiction
and
is
handled
by
the
district
attorney
who
is
an
independent
elected
public
official
and
not
strictly
subject
to
the
appellate
division.
mr.
denis
hurley
in
--
he
--
he
--
even
before
this
judicial
inquiry
started,
the
district
attorney
was
conducting
on
his
own
a
so-called
ambulance
chasing
investigation
into
corrupt
--
alleged
--
allegedly
corrupt
lawyers.
that's
absolutely
independent
of
the
judicial
inquiry.
mr.
denis
hurley
at
--
at
--
mr.
denis
hurley
none.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
--
he's
--
he's
conducted
his
own
investigation
proceeded
against
lawyers
on
his
own.
and
then
in
some
few
instances
on
the
recommendation
of
the
justice
presiding
at
the
judicial
inquiry,
the
appellate
division
has
referred
some
of
these
matters
arising
out
of
the
inquiry
to
the
district
attorney
for
possible
criminal
proceedings.
but
once
he
gets
in
the
hands
of
the
district
attorney,
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
the
judicial
inquiry
does
is
investigate
and
then
the
justice
presiding
reports
to
the
appellate
division
and
the
appellate
division
either
takes
no
action
or
it
recommends
disciplinary
action
or
it
recommends
criminal
action
in
which
event
the
matter
goes
to
the
district
attorney
and
then
it's
entirely
up
to
him.
so
that
there's
no
investigation
as
such
by
us
into
crime.
that's
in
another
problems.
the
appellate
division
inquiry
called
the
judicial
inquiry
here
is
mainly
into
so-called
"ambulance
chasing"
in
the
all
accepted
sense
of
that
term
and
it's
into
unethical
conduct
of
lawyers
violation
of
the
rules
of
court
which
prime
facie
constitute
professional
misconduct,
inquiry
into
the
canons
of
ethics
as
to
whether
there's
been
any
violation
and
only
incidentally
into
crime.
i'll
come
to
a
case
later,
the
leading
case
in
new
york
on
this
matter
people
ex
rel.
karlin
against
culkin
where
the
opinion
was
written
by
chief
judge
cardozo.
and
he
points
out
the
distinctions
between
the
judicial
inquiry
and
a
particular
investigation
into
crime.
in
other
words,
sometimes,
we
hid
upon
crime
but
most
of
the
offenses
are
less
than
criminal,
less
than
penal.
now,
the
next
point
that
was
raised
yesterday
is
the
question
of
the
ground
upon
which
this
lawyer
predicated
his
refusal
to
answer.
now,
the
refusal
of
the
attorney
in
this
case
to
answer
questions
was
grounded
upon
the
state
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that's
article
1
section
6
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
and
not
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
denis
hurley
no.
well,
he
--
he
raised
--
if
your
honor
would
care
to
look
at
the
record,
page
61
and
62,
there's
the
whole
answer
of
the
lawyer
to
the
petition
for
the
discipline.
and
on
page
61,
he
answers
the
--
the
petition
which
contain
the
specifications
by
admitting
the
first
22
paragraphs
of
the
petition.
he
denied
paragraph
23rd
which
is
the
paragraph
where
we
say
that
by
his
refusals
to
answer,
he
breached
his
inherent
duty
as
a
lawyer.
he
wasn't
candid
and
frank
with
the
court
and
he
frustrated
the
court
in
its
inquiry.
then
he
goes
on
and
affirmatively
alleges
an
affirmative
defense,
which
i
take
to
be
the
soul
issue
in
this
matter.
and
under
that
affirmative
defense,
he
pleads
his
right
to
self-incrimination
under
this
new
york
state
constitution.
that's
the
top
of
page
62.
he
cites
the
cases
of
the
court
of
appeals
up
to
that
time
that
he
relies
on
and
then
he
says
that
there's
been
a
denial
of
due
process
to
him
in
violation
of
his
rights
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
claiming
also
a
penalty
hardship
and
forfeiture
and
also
the
last
paragraph
that
the
right
to
practice
law
is
a
right
of
liberty
and
property
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
nowhere
is
there
any
allegation
either
in
the
pleading
or
in
the
testimony
of
--
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
also
in
answer
to
a
question
yesterday,
we
do
not
investigate
federal
crimes.
this
is
a
state
inquiry
by
the
court
and
there's
no
such
claim
of
federal
crimes
asserted
anywhere
in
this
case.
now,
on
--
on
that
score
and
in
opposing
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
we
conceded
that
the
petitioner
had
asserted
the
claim
of
depravation
of
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but,
as
i've
said,
he
made
no
claim
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
amended
remittitur
conceded
also
petitioner's
assertion
of
depravation
of
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
but
held
that
his
rights
had
not
been
violated.
therefore,
in
opposing
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
we
argued
one,
that
the
non-federal
grounds
upon
which
the
new
york
courts
rely
were
entirely
adequate
to
support
the
final
order
of
disbarment
and
two,
the
petitioner's
claim
of
depravation
of
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
is
insubstantial.
so
that
the
question
that
was
actually
resolved
here,
as
i
see
it,
as
the
opinions
of
the
courts,
i
think,
very
clearly
demonstrate,
the
question
that
was
actually
resolved
was
whether
there
was
any
conflict
between
the
new
york
statute
namely
section
90
of
the
judiciary
law
pertaining
to
disciplinary
proceedings
of
lawyers
and
the
provision
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
against
self-incrimination.
that
was
the
soul
question
that
was
determined
by
the
courts
of
new
york.
now,
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
because
i
think
this
is
a
question
that's
related
to
some
of
the
other
matters
that
have
been
before
this
court
and
were
argued
only
yesterday,
anastaplo
and
konigsberg
that
in
new
york,
the
underlying
question
in
this
case
was
decided
32
years
ago
in
1928
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
that's
the
opinion
i
referred
to
a
minute
ago
by
chief
judge
cardozo
where
a
lawyer
was
held
in
contempt
of
court
for
refusing
to
answer
proper
legal
questions
in
new
york's
first
judicial
inquiry.
now,
the
lawyer
there
did
not
plead
self-incrimination
but
he
attacked
the
whole
judicial
inquiry.
he
said
that
there
was
no
power
in
the
court
to
conduct
such
an
investigation
into
lawyers
and
that
there
had
to
be
charges
--
complaints
and
charges
and
so
on
but
a
general
preliminary
investigation,
he
claimed,
could
not
be
conducted.
so
therefore,
he
refused
to
be
sworn
and
he
refused
to
testify.
and
he
was
held
in
contempt
for
refusing,
the
bare
refusing
to
testify
in
that
landmark
case.
mr.
denis
hurley
no,
this
was
--
this
arose
in
the
preliminary
investigations.
mr.
denis
hurley
the
lawyer
was
called
as
a
witness.
he
refused
to
talk.
mr.
denis
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
hurley
that's
true,
your
honor,
but
there,
the
lawyer
hadn't
claimed
it
so
it
seem
to
me
that
that
was
unnecessary
to
the
decision
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
but
--
but
i
go
further
even
though
it
was
probably
unnecessary
because
it
hadn't
been
claimed.
nevertheless,
judge
--
chief
judge
cardozo
did
say
he
had
to
answer
subject
to
his
privilege.
mr.
denis
hurley
yes,
indeed.
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
i
--
i
like
to,
if
i
may,
come
to
it
in
order
but
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
to
say
now
in
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
that
i
think
that
our
case
is
perfectly
consistent
with
that
case
because
the
court
made
a
distinction
between
the
lawyer
coming
as
a
witness
as
a
citizen
and
as
a
lawyer.
and
as
a
citizen,
he
could
invoke
his
privilege
but
as
a
lawyer,
since
he
refused
to
obey
the
mandate
of
the
court
to
answer
its
questions,
he
forfeited
his
--
his
membership
in
the
bar.
in
other
words,
the
--
our
case
is
really
an
extension,
therefore,
of
the
karlin
case
and
i
think
perfectly
in
line
with
it
and
perfectly
consistent
with
the
karlin
case.
but
i
did
want
to
--
mr.
denis
hurley
yes,
indeed.
mr.
denis
hurley
under
new
york
law
and
under
new
york
state
constitution,
yes,
indeed.
mr.
denis
hurley
no,
it
wasn't
--
it
wasn't
in
the
case.
but
i
think
it's
most
interesting
in
the
light
of
the
claim
that's
made
here
that
there,
we
have
the
law
on
the
refusal
of
a
lawyer
to
talk
to
the
court
that
admitted
him
and
the
court
that
has
disciplinary
power
over
him
in
--
in
its
investigation
into
the
conduct
or
misconduct
of
lawyers
that
there,
we
have
that
case
which
has
been
the
law
of
new
york
for
32
years.
but
not
only
that,
judge
cardozo,
in
that
case,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
indicated,
and
we
all
well
know,
he
traced
the
history
of
the
court's
supervisory
control
over
lawyers
back
to
the
new
york
state
constitution
of
1777.
and
beyond
that,
for
over
300
years
to
england
and
to
the
authority
of
the
inns
of
--
of
court
over
lawyers
and
then
the
inns
of
court
intern
visited
by
the
judges
and
of
course,
as
we
know
in
the
history
of
that,
mr.
judge
cardozo's
so-called
a
scholarly
points
out
even
as
to
the
cut
of
the
beard
and
--
and
the
clothes
that
the
--
the
lawyers
wore
so
that
the
--
the
question
of
the
refusal
to
answer,
according
to
chief
judge
cardozo,
went
back
over
300
years
in
england
and
then
was
incorporated
in
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
1777.
so
that
until
now,
we
haven't
had
a
lawyer
refused
to
answer
a
question
put
by
the
court
in
an
inquiry
by
the
court
into
the
prevalence
of
unethical
conduct.
but
it
said
now
that
this
case
is
different
because
this
attorney
based
his
refusal
to
answer
upon
the
plea
of
self-incrimination
in
reliance
upon
the
new
york
state
constitution
only.
that
i
say
is
a
state
question.
but
the
courts
of
new
york
have
refused
to
recognize
that
claim
difference.
and
they've
held
that
an
attorney's
refusal
to
answer,
no
matter
what
the
ground,
is
a
breach
of
the
attorney's
inherent
duty
to
the
court.
it's
an
obstruction
of
the
court's
investigation
and
it's
a
defiance
of
the
court's
plenary
power
and
control
over
lawyers.
and
that
in
refusing
to
answer,
the
lawyer
frustrates
the
investigation
and
renders
the
court
impotent
to
perform
its
statutory
and
inherent
responsibilities
in
the
cleansing
of
the
bar
and
in
the
disciplining
of
lawyers.
now,
in
reaching
that
conclusion,
as
i
see
it,
the
courts
of
new
york
were
meticulous
in
pointing
out
that
the
attorney
was
not
deprived
of
his
constitutional
guarantee
against
self-incrimination.
indeed,
the
right
to
invoke
his
privilege
was
upheld
and
--
and
sustained
in
all
three
courts
of
new
york
that
the
additional
special
term
at
the
appellate
division
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
therefore,
new
york
ruled
that
this
attorney
was
a
court
of
the
fullest
measure
of
his
constitutional
guarantee
against
incriminating
himself
by
his
own
testimony.
the
new
york
state
constitution
guarantees
nothing
more
than
self-protection
against
self-incrimination.
it
doesn't
guarantee
that
he
may
not
be
subject
to
indictment,
prosecution
or
conviction
through
the
testimony
of
other
persons
nor
does
the
constitution
guarantee
that
he
may
defy
the
authority
of
the
courts
in
its
proper
investigation
or
that
he
may
not
be
disciplined
for
remaining
silent
when
it
is
his
special
duty
as
an
officer
of
the
court
to
speak
out
forthrightly
with
candor
and
frankness
in
response
to
the
court's
judicial
inquiry
into
misconduct
at
the
bar.
yes,
sir
--
mr.
denis
hurley
yes,
sir.
mr.
denis
hurley
yes,
it
maybe,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
hurley
it
is
a
dilemma.
but
the
courts
of
new
york
have
said
it's
--
it's
a
dilemma.
mr.
denis
hurley
where
--
where
he
chooses
--
where
he
--
where
he's
--
where
he's
forced
into
this
choice
and
he
either
--
he
either
uses
his
right
as
a
citizen
and
claims
his
privilege
and
refuses
to
talk
or
he
speaks
up
as
a
lawyer
should,
as
a
lawyer
should
and
he
takes
whatever
punishment
is
coming
to
him
on
the
basis
of
what
he
has
done.
that
seems
to
be
--
to
be
the
result
of
the
--
of
the
attitude
of
the
courts
of
new
york
on
the
subject.
in
other
words
--
mr.
denis
hurley
yes
your
honor.
mr.
denis
hurley
well,
i
didn't
want
to
say
anything
about
that.
i
--
i
doubt
if
there's
a
federal
question
here.
we
vigorously
oppose
the
grant
of
writ.
mr.
denis
hurley
could
it
repeal
it,
your
honor?
i
think
so.
i
think
it
could.
i
think
that
is
a
problem
that
has
been
discussed
and
talked
about.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
part
of
the
state
constitution.
mr.
denis
hurley
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
hurley
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
denis
hurley
i
don't
recall
the
year
when
it
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
was
put
in
but
it
hasn't
always
been
--
it
hasn't
always
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
been
in
--
in
the
constitution.
mr.
denis
hurley
in
new
jersey?
is
that
so?
i
didn't
know
that.
mr.
denis
hurley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
denis
hurley
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
denis
hurley
that's
--
that's
my
point.
mr.
denis
hurley
well,
my
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
well,
my
problem
is
whether
the
--
whether
the
court
of
appeals
simply
said
as
--
as
they
framed
the
question
in
the
--
the
remittitur,
they
--
they
talked
about
the
appellant
having
asserted
that
there
was
like
a
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.
in
other
words,
there
was
a
claim
made
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
but
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
but
clearly
did
they
pass
out
of
the
something
substantial
or
--
or
not
substantial.
now,
if
--
mr.
denis
hurley
but
the
--
the
language
--
mr.
denis
hurley
that's
right.
now,
i
--
i
--
frankly,
i'm
--
i
--
i
have
--
i
think
this
case
is
of
such
importance
not
only
to
new
york
but
to
every
state
in
the
union
that
--
that
i've
no
--
no
hesitancy
and
--
and
very
readily
asking
this
court
to
pass
upon
on
the
merits.
i
think
--
i
think
that's
the
attitude
of
the
new
york
courts.
now,
judge
baldock
said
that
this
was
one
of
the
most
important
questions
involving
lawyers
that
have
ever
arisen
in
new
york.
and
until
this
case
is
settled,
we
will
have
many,
many
problems
in
judicial
inquiries
and
otherwise.
mr.
denis
hurley
he
--
he
is
the
first
but
immediately
upon
his
refusing,
41
others
followed
him
[laughter].
so
we
have
--
we
have
the
cases
of
41
other
lawyers
really
writing
on
the
results
of
this
case.
actually,
we
had
--
i
think
to
date,
we
have
about
98
who
have
--
who
have
pleaded
the
privilege.
the
second
to
the
lawyers
come
the
doctors.
20
or
42
--
42
lawyers,
20
are
doctors
and
the
others
were
layman,
insurance
brokers,
insurance
employees
claims
justice
and
so
on.
mr.
denis
hurley
the
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
the
attorneys?
mr.
denis
hurley
oh,
yes.
mr.
denis
hurley
resolved
in
this
court
and
--
mr.
denis
hurley
--
well,
it
denied
certiorari
in
(inaudible)
yes.
mr.
denis
hurley
that's
right.
mr.
denis
hurley
all
subject
to
it.
and
--
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
have
just
--
that
was
in
the
first
department
and
their
rule
has
now
been
made
uniform
in
the
second
department,
so
we
have
the
same
rules
in
--
in
both
departments
now.
mr.
denis
hurley
that's
right.
they
--
they
--
mr.
denis
hurley
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
have
a
--
excuse
me,
your
honor.
they
have
a
sliding
scale
in
new
york
or
either
take
the
sliding
scale
or
you
take
a
flat
one-third.
you
can
take
a
flat
one-third,
a
contingent
fee
or
go
according
to
the
sliding
scale.
mr.
denis
hurley
if
it's
a
felony.
mr.
denis
hurley
if
it's
a
conviction
of
a
felony,
it's
automatic
disbarment.
mr.
denis
hurley
possibly,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
in
--
arising
from
our
proceeding,
i
think
there
were
probably
five
or
six
cases
now
in
four
years.
one
lawyer
was
acquitted
and
later
disbarred
and
disciplinary
though.
two
lawyers
got
six
months
in
jail.
they
pleaded
to
a
misdemeanor
and
others
pleaded
guilty
to
felonies
and
consented
to
disbarment.
so
six
were
dispose
up
today
in
four
years
in
that
way.
so
that,
you
see,
the
great
majority
of
the
cases
involved
are
something
other
than
crimes.
and
that,
of
course,
we
have
the
--
the
problem
of
--
of
whether
--
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
courts
of
having
to
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
whereas
we
have
the
--
the
weight
of
evidence,
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
in
the
disciplinary
proceeding.
i
should
like
to
point
out
and
i
think
this
is
important
here
is
--
whether
in
some
of
these
other
cases
that
this
case,
as
i
conceive
it,
points
up
too
sharply
conflicting
views
of
the
role
of
the
lawyer
in
american
society.
and
i
think
the
real
question
that's
presented
in
this
case
involves
the
true
status
of
the
american
lawyer
or
if
you
--
if
one
would
prefer
more
modern
current
madison
avenue
style,
the
true
image
that
should
be
projected
of
the
lawyer,
by
the
courts
and
by
the
bar,
not
the
lawyer
of
fiction
or
tv
or
movies
or
the
comics
but
the
--
the
real
honest
to
goodness
image
as
lawyers
and
--
and
judges
know
he
should
be.
in
other
words,
is
he
just
a
plain
american
citizen
with
no
more
obligations
or
no
additional
burdens
or
responsibilities,
and
the
ordinary
citizen?
is
he
only
as
he's
claimed
here
by
the
opposition
only
a
bear
licensee
of
the
state
or
is
he
something
more?
now,
i
think
this
court
and
the
courts
of
new
york
have
indicated
more
and
more
that
the
true
role
of
the
lawyer
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
trustee.
and
i
think
if
that's
considered
for
a
few
moments,
you'll
see
how
--
how
that
works
out
with
every
element
as
i
--
as
i
conceive
it
of
--
of
a
trust
involved
here.
and
it
seems
to
be
the
judgment
of
the
--
of
the
courts
of
new
york
that
when
a
lawyer,
as
i
said
before,
is
called
to
the
witness
stand,
he
comes
there
in
two
distinct
capacities.
first,
as
a
citizen,
with
all
the
rights
and
privileges
and
duties
of
a
citizen,
but
beyond
that,
he
appears
as
a
lawyer
with
all
of
the
rights
and
privileges
of
the
lawyer
and
also
all
of
the
stern
duties
and
solemn
responsibilities
of
his
lawyerhood.
so
that
we
think
he's
--
and
the
courts
of
--
of
new
york
have
said
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
emphasized
in
--
in
various
opinions
involving
lawyers
that
he's
more
than
a
--
a
mere
licensee
and
more
it
came
through
a
trustee.
so
that
we
--
we
work
that
out
in
this
way.
that
when
a
lawyer
is
admitted
to
the
bar.
he
presents
himself
for
admission
and
he
is
admitted
to
the
bar,
the
effect
seems
to
be
that
the
court,
the
admitting
court
is
representing
to
society
at
large
that
here
is
an
honorable
man
worthy
of
the
public's
trust
and
confidence,
worthy
to
uphold
the
honor
of
the
profession
and
as
its
officer,
the
dignity
of
the
court.
so
that
when
a
lawyer
takes
the
oath,
as
happened
here
this
morning,
takes
the
oath,
whether
in
this
court
or
any
other
court
in
the
land,
he
is
held
out
and
certified
by
the
admitting
court
as
a
person
in
whom
the
court
places
its
special
confidence
and
in
whom
the
public
may
trust.
that
certainly
consistent
with
what
chief
justice
hughes
said
some
years
ago
that
the
practice
of
the
profession
of
the
law
is
the
privilege
administration
of
a
public
trust.
and
i
think
it's
upon
the
basis
of
that
--
of
that
certification,
that
representation
by
the
court
that
in
every
specific
case
that
the
lawyer
handles,
his
clients
confined
the
most
precious
causes
to
him.
they
trust
in
him
even
though
they
never
met
the
lawyer
before
and
they
put
in
his
hands
because
they
trust
him
on
the
representation
by
the
court
and
holding
out
by
the
court,
they
entrust
him
with
the
defense
of
their
properties
and
their
liberties
and
their
lives.
and
in
a
broader
sense,
may
i
suggest
to
this
court,
in
a
broader,
in
a
more
general
sense,
as
i
conceive
it,
every
lawyer
is
also
a
trustee
of
the
vast
rich
heritage
of
the
common
law,
of
all
of
our
statutory
law
and
of
all
that
the
law
stands
for.
so
that
i
submit
that
upon
admission,
a
lawyer
in
reality
becomes
a
trustee
of
the
law
and
the
court
appoints
him
as
such.
you
have
a
trust
grieves.
you
have
the
great
body
of
the
law
that
was
so
eloquently
described
by
justice
holmes.
you
have
the
public
as
the
beneficiary.
you
have
the
court
as
the
creator
or
the
secular
of
the
trust.
now,
you
have
a
lawyer
as
the
trustee
and
he's
called
in
by
the
very
court
that
admitted
him
and
it
has
the
power
to
discipline
him.
he's
called
in
to
give
an
accounting
of
his
stewardship.
he
may
refuse
to
answer,
that
we
conceive.
he
may
invoke
his
privilege
and
his
plea
must
be
sustained
if
he
invokes
his
constitutional
privilege.
but
the
courts
of
new
york
said,
in
failing
to
account,
for
his
failure
to
account,
he
forfeits
his
trusteeship
in
the
bar.
and
in
this
case,
the
court's
decree
that
petitioner
by
failing
to
account
for
his
professional
conduct
could
be
stood
no
longer.
now,
carrying
the
analogy
further,
where
a
court
ousts
a
trustee
for
refusal
to
render
his
account,
he
comes
in,
he's
told
to
render
his
account,
whether
he
is
a
testamentary
trustee
or
whether
he
is
a
trustee
of
a
living
trust
and
he
refuses
to
account
under
a
claim
of
constitutional
privilege,
i
submit,
that
a
claim
of
depravation
of
due
process
has
no
validity
in
such
circumstances.
certainly
to
prevent
his
removal,
the
trustee
cannot
insist
that
the
beneficiaries
must
--
as
this
claimed
here,
must
in
the
first
instance
prove
an
affirmative
case
against
him
of
wrongdoing
against
the
trustee
before
he
must
come
forward
with
his
account.
and
the
right
to
specific
charges
and
prove
to
confronta
--
confrontation
on
cross-examination
of
witnesses,
i
submit,
is
beside
the
point
where
there
is
an
absolute
duty
in
the
first
instance
of
coming
forward
with
the
true
account.
i
gather
my
time
is
up.
