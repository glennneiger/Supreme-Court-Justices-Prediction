justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
that
the
government
is
without
power
to
do
a
way
with
the
employment
relationship
if
it
wants
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
thought
you're
going
on
the
basis
of
some
kind
of
natural
law
on
that
theory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
it
was
that's
why
i
am
asking
you
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
it
was,
and
that's
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
didn't
quite
understand
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
again,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
saying
that
the
government
is
without
power
to
regulate
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
employment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it's
an
inherent
power,
i
gather,
that
the
government
has
nothing
to
do
with.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
been
able
to
discover
that
to
yourself
here
(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
court
--
the
court
below
doesn't
seem
to
discover
it
but
if
you
take
it,
may
be
we
might.
