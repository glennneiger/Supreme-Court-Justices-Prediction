mr.
julius
l.
sackman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think,
if
your
honor
please,
that
i
would
prefer
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
--
depending
upon
the
communist
control
act
with
some
incidental
reference
to
the
action
of
the
state
apart
from
the
communist
control
act
itself.
may
i
say
at
the
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think
that
the
impact
of
the
communist
control
act
upon
the
action
of
the
industrial
commissioner
necessarily
is
of
such
character
that
it
might
conceivably
weaken
the
case,
and
i
would
prefer
to
emphasize
the
impact
of
the
communist
control
act
on
his
action
first.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
appreciate
that
fact,
your
honor.
the
industrial
commissioner
of
the
state
of
new
york,
as
your
honors
realize
by
now,
administers
the
state
unemployment
insurance
program.
in
him
is
vested
the
power
and
upon
him
is
imposed
the
obligation
among
other
things
of
determining
whether
a
stated
employment
or
a
specific
employer
or
employee
comes
within
the
coverage
in
the
state's
unemployment
insurance
law.
in
making
this
determination,
the
commissioner
is,
of
course,
governed
primarily
by
the
provisions
of
the
unemployment
insurance
law
itself,
thus,
coverage
may
be
--
may
depend
upon
whether
the
employee's
work
is
performed
within
the
state
or
in
certain
cases
upon
the
number
of
persons
employed
excluded
from
participation
in
the
program
or
agricultural
labor,
employees
who
are
essentially
independent
contractors,
employees
of
governmental
and
certain
non-profit
making
organizations,
the
employees
under
certain
circumstances
of
federal
instrumentalities,
such
as
national
banks,
national
banking
associations,
the
spouse
or
minor
child
of
an
employer,
golf
caddies,
baby
sitters
and
minors
engaged
in
casual
labor.
so
that
there
isn't
coverage
of
every
employment.
there
are
certain
employments
which
are
specifically
and
expressly
included
--
excluded
under
the
unemployment
insurance
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
itself.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
none
in
the
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
none
in
the
new
york
employ
--
unemployment
insurance
law
itself.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
now,
my
point
is,
however,
that
in
addition
to
the
specific
criteria
which
governed
the
question
of
coverage
under
the
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law,
the
commissioner
is,
of
course,
bound
also
by
other
statutes,
federal
and
state,
which
either
are
in
pari
materia
with
the
unemployment
insurance
law
or
otherwise
exercise
a
governing
influence
upon
the
commissioner's
performance
of
a
statutory
duty.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
not
to
my
knowledge,
sir.
now,
under
--
under
the
new
york
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
true,
sir.
that's
true.
now,
under
new
york
law
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think
either
as
--
as
individuals
or
as,
insofar
as
classifications
affect
individuals,
as
classifications.
for
example,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
impact
of
the
communist
control
act
would
affect
the
communist
party
as
an
individual
insofar
as
in
--
as
an
individual
may
be
an
employer.
if
they,
under
the
communist
control
act,
cannot
have
the
capacity
to
be
an
employer,
then
this
has
an
impact
upon
the
industrial
commissioner's
obligation
to
determine
whether
they
do
come
within
the
coverage
of
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law
or
not.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
implicit
in
the
power
that
--
to
make
this
determination
is
that
if
any
individual
who
seeks
to
be
an
employer
is
engaged
in
a
calling
and
an
employment
which
is
illegal,
whether
in
say
or
merely
prohibit
them,
if
it
is
illegal
that
this
is
to
be
read
into
the
law
and
that
such
an
employment
would
not
be
covered.
as
an
illustration,
which
i
gave
as
a
rather
farfetched
illustration,
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
mafia
was
organized
on
a
--
on
an
organizational
basis
with
so-called
board
of
directors
and
presidents
and
had
employees,
and
it
sought
to
protect
its
employees
by
registering
under
the
unemployment
insurance
law,
clearly,
without
being
specifically
and
expressly
included
--
excluded
under
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law,
it
would
--
could
not
possibly
be
an
employer
in
the
very
nature
of
things.
and
here,
we
--
we
--
i
make
the
analogy
that
the
communist
party,
whether
it
is
such
either
inherently
or
whether
it
is
such
by
a
reason
of
the
communist
control
act,
if
it
is
an
illegal
organization,
if
it
is
taken
with
the
illegality
which
prevents
it
from
becoming
an
employer
under
our
law,
then
the
industrial
commissioner
has
the
right
to
exclude
him
from
coverage.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
have
no
idea,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
exclude.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
sir.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
sir.
that's
my
argument
in
that
respect.
now,
the
right
of
the
industrial
commissioner
to
determine
who
is
or
who
may
not
be
an
employer
under
the
act,
in
other
words,
who
may
participate
in
the
benefits
of
the
unemployment
insurance
program
is
furthermore
purely
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
question
of
his
right
to
determine
who
is
an
employer
is
a
matter
of
state
law
which
is
not
within
the
purview
of
this
court's
power
to
review.
now,
the
manner
in
which
he
reviews
it
and
the
end
result
of
that
review,
insofar
as
they
may
affect
certain
rights
which
arise
under
the
federal
constitution
or
concern,
of
course,
are
concededly
subject
to
this
court's
power
of
review.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
referred
to
a
case
called
"matter
of
electrolux
corporation"
which
--
in
which
they
had
previously
held.
this
was
a
new
york
court
of
appeals
case
which
i
have
cited,
i
believe,
at
page
22
of
my
brief
in
which
they
held
that
--
of
course,
the
industrial
commissioner
had
the
power
to
make
this
determination
of
who
is
covered
and
who
is
not
covered,
who
may
--
may
or
may
not
participate
in
the
unemployment
insurance
program.
and
if
they've
held
that
he
can
do
that,
then,
of
course,
he
has
the
right
to
exercise
the
necessary
discretion
in
reaching
that
result.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
unfortunately,
there
is
raised
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
the
questions
of
construction
of
the
communist
control
act
does
it
do
what
we
say
it
is
and
furthermore
assuming
that
it
does
do
what
we
say
it
did
is
unconstitutional.
and
of
course,
the
court,
therefore,
had
to
go
into
those
further
questions
to
--
this
didn't
bear,
therefore,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say
so,
upon
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
itself
but
upon
whether
he
had
the
right
to
exercise
the
discretion
either
way.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
they
have,
in
effect,
said
that,
your
honor,
when
they
say
that
this
raises
certain
federal
constitutional
questions.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
oh
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
oh,
no,
no.
i
don't
take
--
i
--
i
misunderstood
your
honor.
i
don't
take
that
ground.
i
merely
state
that
the
right
of
the
industrial
commissioner
to
make
the
determination,
that
the
bear
existence
of
that
right
is
conceded
to
be
state
law.
but
that
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
that's
right.
that's
exactly
--
that's
exactly
the
point
i
make.
now,
the
simple
factual
situation
which
is
presented
here
is
that
the
commissioner
impelled
thereto
by
the
provisions
of
the
communist
control
act
of
1954
and
upon
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
suspended
the
petitioners'
registrations
as
employers
under
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law.
now,
in
the
administrative
proceeding
which
ensued
upon
that
determination,
in
establishing
before
the
referee
a
prima
facie
case,
the
industrial
commissioner
relied
on
the
twin
doctrines
of
judicial
notice
and
judicial
regard
for
legislative
findings
as
to
the
character
of
the
communist
party
as
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
by
force
and
violence.
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioners
were
free
to
submit
such
evidence
as
they
saw
fit
to
controvert
that
fact
but
that
they
failed
to
avail
themselves
of
that
opportunity.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
the
issue
before
the
commissioner
was
before
the
referee.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
may
i
say
this.
the
issue
before
the
referee
was
whether
the
industrial
commissioner
was
justified
in
suspending
the
registrations
of
the
petitioners
as
employers
under
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law.
and
my
point
is
that
he
was
justified
by
reason
of
the
fact,
one,
that
under
the
doctrine
of
judicial
notice,
it
has
been
established
what
the
historical
character
of
the
communist
party
is
as
one
which
seeks
by
advocacy
and
by
force
and
violence
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
he
could
rely
on
this
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
presenting
one,
a
prima
facie
case
under
the
criminal
conspiracy
as
aspect
of
the
argument
and
two,
as
a
basis
for
the
justification
for
action
under
the
communist
control
act
of
1954.
number
two,
he
relied
also
on
the
declarations
to
the
same
effect
which
will
contain
in
the
legislative
findings
both
of
the
communist
control
act
and
other
federal
and
state
statutes
to
the
same
effect.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
will
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
--
i
think
that
that
is
the
predominant
and
probably
decisive
question
in
this
case.
i
have
sought
to
supplement
it
with
the
other
aspects
of
it,
but
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
is
by
virtue
of
the
communist
control
act
that
the
industrial
commissioner
was
impelled
to
do
what
he
did
and
was
compelled
to
do
so.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes,
sir.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
would
say
it
would
then
be
questionable,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
yes.
i
--
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
--
i
assert
to
this
court
that
he
was
one,
compelled
to
do
what
he
did
by
virtue
of
the
provisions
of
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
two,
that
actions
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act
that
he
could
make
the
same
decision
which
he
made
by
virtue
of
the
inherent
illegality
of
the
communist
party
as
an
entity
for
the
exercise
of
the
very
rights
which
they
seek
to
exercise
under
the
new
--
under
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
if
your
honors
of
the
--
are
of
the
opinion
that
that
is
new
york
law
which
is
not
subject
within
the
purview
of
this
court's
power
to
review,
i'm
willing
for
the
purpose
of
my
argument
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
valid
or
invalid,
i
--
my
understanding
of
the
situation
would
be
that
if
it
were
new
york
law,
then
it
would
therefore
not
be
within
the
preview
of
this
court's
review.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
right.
well,
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
there
is
no
legislative
law
referred
to.
i
--
i
take
--
i
stopped
with
the
proposition
on
the
criminal
conspiracy
aspect
of
it
that
by
virtue
of
the
judicial
notice
doctrine,
the
communist
party
is
a
criminal
conspiracy
for
the
forceable
and
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
of
the
united
states.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
the
--
the
remittitur,
of
course,
does
say
that
there
were
questions
raised
under
the
--
the
amendment
of
the
remittitur
points
out
that
there
were
questions
raised
by
the
petitioners
herein
with
respect
to
certain
violations
of
the
federal
constitution
to
wit,
first
amendment
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
they
also
say
necessarily
passed
upon.
well,
then,
perhaps,
i
should
avoid
--
in
view
of
the
amendment
of
the
remittitur,
perhaps,
i
should
save
time
in
the
argument
and
confine
myself
to
the
argument
involving
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
as
compelling
the
action
of
the
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
if
you
do
not
agree
with
this
position,
it
would
require
a
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
i
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
[laughter]
i
--
i'm
quite
satisfied
that
so
strong
was
the
basis
of
the
communist
control
act
for
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
am
willing
to
attempt
to
support
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
determination
on
that
basis.
now,
turning
to
a
consideration
of
the
impact
of
the
communist
control
act,
we
find,
first,
recognition
of
the
adherent
illegality
of
the
communist
party
in
the
clause
of
section
3
which
states
that
the
communist
party
is
not
entitled
to
any
of
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
which
are
attendant
to
--
for
illegal
bodies
created
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof.
now,
the
title
of
the
section
and
the
opening
clause
referred
to
"the
communist
party,
its
successors
and
subsidiary
organizations".
now,
this
language,
standing
alone,
is
broad
enough
to
include
the
communist
parties
of
the
various
states
and
territories.
however,
if
there
is
any
doubt
in
connection
with
this
matter,
reference
maybe
had
to
section
4
(b)
of
the
act
wherein
the
term
communist
party
is
defined
as,
"the
organization
now
known
as
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
the
communist
party
of
any
state
or
subdivision
thereof
and
any
unit
or
subdivision
of
any
such
organization,
whether
or
not
any
changes
hereafter
made
in
the
name
thereof."
now,
the
petitioners
assert
that
the
act
does
not
affect
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
which
arise
under
state
law.
they
distinguish
between
the
opening
clause
of
section
3
which
refers
to
the
government
of
the
united
states
or
the
government
of
any
state,
territory,
district,
or
possession
thereof
and
the
two
later
clauses
which
deal
with
non-entitlement
and
termination
of
the
rights
created
on
the
jurisdiction
"of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof."
from
this,
they
conclude
that
congress
demonstrated
its
recognition
of
the
distinction
between
a
political
subdivision
and
a
state.
and
that
congress
intended
by
this
shorthand
reference
to
affect
only
jurisdictions
such
as
the
district
of
columbia
and
federal
territories
and
possessions
which
are
political
subdivisions
of
the
united
states.
now,
in
the
first
place,
i
might
observe
that
in
casey
against
boldt,
1946
decision
of
this
court,
there
was
established,
the
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
that
the
mere
absence
of
the
word
"state"
in
a
federal
statute
does
not
exclude
applicability
of
--
of
that
statute
to
the
states.
secondly,
it
was
quite
clearly
the
intent
of
congress
to
include
in
the
last
two
phrases
dealing
with
non-entitlement
and
termination
of
the
rights
in
shorthand
form,
the
same
political
entities
as
were
included
in
detail
in
the
opening
phrase.
this
is
apparent
form
the
context
of
the
latter
two
phrases
in
which
the
political
entities
which
are
referred
to
are
entities
which
have
lawmaking
powers.
certainly,
the
district
of
columbia
and
many
of
the
federal
possessions
do
not
have
independent
or
sovereign
lawmaking
powers
under
which
corporations
may
be
formed
and
under
which
statutory
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
may
arise.
laws
for
the
district
in
such
possessions
were
enacted
generally
by
congress.
a
state,
on
the
other
hand,
has
independent
sovereign
lawmaking
powers
in
the
respect
which
i
have
indicated.
confining
the
meaning
of
political
subdivision
in
the
last
clause
to
the
district
and
the
federal
possessions
is
furthermore
illogical
because
these
two
were
specifically
referred
to
in
the
first
clause.
the
more
logical
conclusion
seems
to
be
that
in
the
first
clause,
the
word
"political
subdivisions"
referred
to
local
subdivisions
or
units
within
the
states
and
territories
while
the
words
"political
subdivision"
as
used
in
the
last
clause,
which
terminates
the
rights
of
the
communist
party
includes
"states".
congressional
intent
too,
as
evidenced
by
senatorial
comments
which
appeared
in
the
congressional
record
during
the
debates
when
this
act
was
a
bill,
would
appear
to
indicate
that
the
act
was
expected,
one,
to
deny
the
party
a
place
on
the
ballot,
two,
to
deprive
it
of
contractual
capacity.
both
of
which
depend
on
state
law.
according
to
the
argument
of
counsel
for
the
parties,
the
act
does
apply
to
hawaii
and
alaska
because
at
the
time
of
its
enactment,
they
were
territories
of
the
united
states.
does
this
--
does
he
now
claim
that
since
these
territories
have
attained
statehood
that
the
law
no
longer
applies
to
them?
and
if
it
is
--
and
if
it
is
admitted
as
it
must
be,
that
the
law
continues
to
apply
to
them,
what
happens
to
the
principle
that
all
states
were
admitted
to
the
union
upon
an
equal
footing?
it
seems
also
obvious
from
the
context
of
the
section
as
a
whole
that
the
laws,
the
benefit
of
which
the
petitioners
have
lost,
are
necessarily
the
laws
of
the
governments,
federal,
state
and
territorial,
which
the
petitioners
threaten
to
overthrow.
the
fine
splitting
of
hairs
and
the
raising
of
the
straw
issue
of
whether
the
nation
was
made
from
the
state
or
the
state
from
the
nation
cannot
obscure
this
intent
which
is
so
clearly
expressed
on
the
statute.
counsel
also
points
out
that
section
3
does
not
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
no,
sir.
the
obligation
to
pay
a
tax
is
not
a
privilege,
if
it
please
your
honor.
and
i
shall
come
to
that
in
just
a
moment,
if
i
may,
with
--
in
a
manner
which
your
honor
puts
it.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
but
we
--
we
say
that
that's
not
a
right
--
we
agree
with
them
that
the
obligation
to
pay
a
tax
is
not
a
right,
privilege
or
immunity.
but
--
but
we
look
at
--
we
look
at
the
situation
from
an
entirely
different
point
of
view
and
if
your
honor
will
bear
with
me
with
--
for
just
a
moment,
i
shall
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
now,
i
--
i
was
about
to
discuss
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
make
the
point
that
section
3
does
not
purport
to
terminate
all
of
their
rights
but
only
those
which
are
heretofore
been
granted
by
reason
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof.
and
they
emphasized
the
word
"granted".
they
then
assert
that
natural
persons
possess
an
inherent
right
to
employ
others,
and
they
conclude
that
if
the
petitioners
were
natural
persons,
their
rights
would
not
be
among
the
rights
which
are
terminated
by
the
section.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
conclusion
is
based
upon
an
erroneous
premise.
although
not
considered
legal
entities
of
common
law,
unincorporated
associations
have
been
statutorily
invested
with
certain
powers
and
capacities
which
stamped
them
unquestionably
as
artificial
entities.
they
have,
in
some
instances,
been
given
power
to
act
in
their
own
names,
in
others,
they
may
still
act
through
natural
persons.
however,
even
in
the
latter
cases,
the
natural
persons
do
not
act
in
their
own
right.
they
are
merely
the
conduits
for
the
effectuation
of
the
purpose
which
is
sought
to
be
accomplished.
assuming
however
arguendo
that
we
were
dealing
with
the
inherent
rights
of
natural
persons,
we
must
assume
that
since
the
petitioners
have
distinguished
such
rights
from
rights
which
are
granted
by
the
state
presumably
by
statute,
that
such
rights
refer
to
those
which
are
in
inexistence
under
the
common
law.
there
is,
of
course,
no
national
common
law
operative
as
such
throughout
the
states
of
the
union.
the
adoption
and
application
of
the
common
law
was
a
matter
left
to
the
several
states
for
determination.
in
new
york,
the
common
law
of
england
remains
enforced
except
as
modified
by
statute
by
force
of
a
constitutional
provision
to
that
effect.
in
other
words,
by
virtue
of
the
constitutional
provision,
the
common
law
is
included
in
that
which
is
granted
by
the
state.
literally,
therefore,
the
provision
of
section
3,
which
is
quoted
by
the
petitioner,
applies
to
all
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
because
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof
include
the
common
law
as
well
as
the
statute
law
of
the
states
and
all
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
are
granted
by
such
laws
since
those
terms
describe
the
extent
to
which
particular
individual
group
claims
or
interest
are
secured
by
law.
in
any
event,
the
use
of
the
word
"granted"
in
the
clause
which
terminated
the
petitioners'
rights,
privileges
and
immunity,
is
of
no
particular
significance
and
may
properly
be
equated
with
the
clearly
broader
term
"attendant"
which
appears
in
the
prior
clause
in
the
same
section,
"the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
or
any
successors
of
such
party
are
not
entitled
to
any
of
the
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
attended
upon
legal
bodies
created
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof."
clearly,
it
must
have
been
the
intention
of
congress
to
terminate
those
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
to
which
it
felt
that
the
petitioners
were
not
entitled.
and
lastly,
on
this
particular
aspect
of
the
case,
i
must
observe
that
the
petitioners
have
urged
that
the
right
to
employ
others
is
a
natural
or
inherent
right.
but
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
right
to
employ
others
or
with
the
general
right
over
the
right
to
enter
to
any
contract
as
in
general
proposition.
we
are
concerned
with
the
right
to
be
an
employer
within
the
meaning
of
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law.
and
that
light
unquestionably
is
the
subject
of
a
statutory
grant.
now,
the
petitioners
have
also
argued
that
the
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
as
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act
evinced
a
legislative
intent
not
to
terminate
the
right
of
the
petitioners
to
have
and
to
function
through
employees.
and
in
support,
thereof,
they
quote
the
department
of
justice
in
the
briefs
submitted
to
this
court
in
communist
party
against
the
subversive
activities
control
board.
the
reference
is,
of
course,
to
the
registration
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
and
to
the
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act
which
deal
with
the
determination
by
a
jury
of
membership
participation
or
knowledge
of
purpose.
the
argument
is
predicated
on
the
obvious
--
obviously
meaningless
assumption
that
congress
would
destroy
the
petitioners
in
one
section
and
recognize
their
continued
viability
in
another.
however,
analysis
of
the
statute
exposes
the
fallacy
of
the
argument.
congress
has
effectively
destroyed
the
communist
party
as
a
legal
entity.
nevertheless,
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
might
drive
the
movement
underground
and
that
it
might
continue
thereafter
on
an
illegal
basis.
mr.
julius
l.
sackman
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
i
was
discussing
before
the
petitioners'
contention
that
the
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
and
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act
evince
the
legislative
intention
not
to
terminate
the
right
of
the
petitioners
to
have
and
function
through
employees
and
that
they
cited
the
support
of
that
fact
certain
statements
of
the
department
of
justice
in
a
brief
submitted
to
this
court
in
communist
party
against
the
subversive
activities
control
board.
i
also
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
reference
was
to
the
registration
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
and
to
the
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act,
which
deal
with
the
determination
by
a
jury
of
membership
participation
or
knowledge
of
purpose.
i'd
also
gotten
to
the
point
where
i
stated
that
the
argument
was
predicated
on
an
obvious
fallacy
that
analysis
of
a
statute
indicated
that
there
was
no
question
of
the
fact
that
congress
had
effectively
destroyed
the
communist
party
as
a
legal
entity,
but
that,
nevertheless,
congress
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
this
might
drive
the
movement
underground
and
that
it
might
thereafter
continue
on
an
illegal
basis
that
this
was
mere
recognition
of
the
character
of
the
movement,
historically.
and
that
the
recent
history
of
these
operations
demonstrated
that
--
that
this
is
what
it
would
do
and
what
it
has
done
under
a
voluntary
situation
and
how
much
more
act
is
that
they
will
do
so
when
they
are
put
out
of
business
by
operation
of
law.
in
any
event,
my
point
is
that
controlled
by
the
government
is
just
as
essential
in
the
one
case
when
they
are
illegally
operating
as
it
is
in
the
other.
the
regulatory
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
and
the
provisions
of
section
5
of
the
communist
control
act
apply
as
well
to
operations
outside
of
the
law
as
they
do
to
those
within
the
law
as
witness
the
registration
of
gamblers
through
the
medium
of
a
tax.
it
is,
moreover,
unsound
and
illogical
to
argue,
assuming
that
the
argument
is
correct,
that
because
the
regulatory
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act
will
have
no
scope
if
the
activity
sought
to
be
regulated
or
prohibited
by
the
communist
control
act
that,
therefore,
the
proviso
in
section
3
of
the
latter
act
should
be
interpreted
to
authorize
the
petitioners
to
continue
to
assert,
as
a
legal
entity,
the
very
rights,
privileges
and
and
immunities
which
that
very
section
terminates.
now,
we
come
now,
in
response
now
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
question,
to
the
all
important
question,
which
was
the
basis
of
the
dissent
in
the
court
below.
chief
judge
desmond,
speaking
for
the
majority
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
held
that
whatever
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
the
petitioners
may
have
had
were
terminated
by
the
communist
control
act.
associate
judge
fuld,
dissenting,
held
and
the
petitioners
here
urged
that
the
requirement
to
pay
an
unemployment
insurance
tax
is
a
liability
imposed
upon
them
and
not
an
immunity
or
right
within
the
communist
control
act.
now,
it
seems
clear
that
the
very
nature
--
that
at
the
very
nature
of
things,
an
obligation
or
duty
to
pay
a
tax
cannot
be
considered
a
right,
privilege
or
an
immunity.
but
the
relevant
and
the
crucial
point
which
is
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
right
to
be
a
registered
employer
was
terminated
by
the
act.
the
correlative
of
the
right
to
be
an
employer
is
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax,
but
the
latter
is
merely
the
tail
which
ought
not
to
be
committed
to
wag
the
dog.
as
well
might
it'd
be
argued
that
the
obligation
to
pay
an
income
tax
is
determinative
of
the
right
to
earn
income
or
to
push
the
analogy
to
an
even
more
absurd
extreme,
the
obligation
to
pay
an
estate
tax
is
determinative
of
the
right
to
pass
title
by
will
or
dissent.
furthermore,
this
court
in
rapkin
against
the
united
states
in
1951
settled
the
law
that
the
obligation
to
pay
a
tax
is
not
dependent
upon
the
legality
of
the
transaction
upon
which
the
tax
is
based.
its
specious
reasoning
to
conclude
that
the
collection
of
a
tax
constitutes
tested
approval
of
the
transactions
from
which
the
obligation
to
pay
the
tax
arose.
the
obvious
conclusion
which
may
be
drawn
from
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
below
is
that
since
the
communist
party
has
not
been
expressly
exempted
from
the
payment
of
the
tax,
it
is,
therefore,
licensed
to
engage
in
transactions
which
have
been
forbidden
by
law.
but
this,
too,
has
been
settled
adversely
to
that
view
in
wainer
against
the
united
states
in
1936
decision
of
this
court.
in
their
reply
brief,
the
petitioners
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
continues
to
collect
taxes
from
the
communist
party
under
the
federal
unemployment
tax
act.
and
they
quote
judge
fuld
to
the
effect
that
this
action
is
diametrically
opposed
to
the
action
of
the
industrial
commissioner
and
constitutes
recognition
of
the
communist
party
as
an
employer.
they
also
referred
to
a
recent
letter
of
the
solicitor
general
of
the
of
the
united
states
to
the
clerk
of
this
court
declining
to
intervene
in
this
case
after
the
court
had
certified
that
the
constitutionality
of
a
federal
statute
had
been
drawn
in
question.
although
the
solicitor
general
stated
other
reasons
explaining
why
he
declined
to
file
a
brief,
there
is
no
gain
saying
the
fact
that
he
agreed
that
under
the
views
of
the
dissenting
judges
below,
the
constitutional
questions
is
not
reached.
it
is
not
clear,
however,
that
the
department
of
justice
agrees
with
the
petitioners
on
the
point
which
they
urged
because
he
merely
states
that
the
information,
as
to
the
practice
of
federal
agencies
in
interpreting
the
statute,
has
been
as
is
set
forth
in
judge
fuld's
opinion.
the
petitioners,
however,
assert
that
it
is
a
fair
inference
from
the
solicitor
general's
letter
that
the
position
attributed
by
judge
fuld
to
the
federal
authorities
is
that
of
the
department
of
justice,
as
well
as
that
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue.
but
how
does
this
square
with
the
solicitor's
statement
in
his
letter
that
the
presentation
of
the
constitutional
question
is
conditional
in
the
sense
that
it
will
be
reached
only
if
the
court
places
one
of
several
interpretations
upon
the
statute.
assuming,
however,
that
the
petitioners'
inference
is
properly
drawn,
we
have
simply
a
difference
of
opinion
between
a
state
administrative
officer
and
a
federal
administrative
officer,
a
difference
of
opinion
between
the
department
of
justice
and
new
york's
attorney
general
as
to
the
meaning
of
a
federal
statute.
there
has
been
no
binding
federal
judicial
construction
of
the
act.
the
federal
inaction
under
the
act
on
administrative
or
other
levels
where
there
has
been
no
judicial
pronouncement
compelling
such
an
action,
does
not
militate
against
the
legal
efficacy
of
the
act.
where
a
statute
is
vague
and
ambiguous,
resort
may
be
held
to
the
practical
construction
of
the
act
as
revealed
by
the
action
of
those
in
whom
the
power
of
enforcement
of
the
statute
is
reposed.
but
the
communist
control
act
is
clear
and
unambiguous
in
its
terms.
it
is
self-executing.
it
is
not
in
need
of
further
statutory
implementation,
either
federal
or
state.
the
failure
of
the
federal
authorities
to
take
action
or
otherwise
test
the
meaning
or
the
validity
of
the
act
need
not
and
cannot
be
construed
as
a
declaration
of
federal
policy
concerning
the
party
status
because
that
policy
has
been
clearly
and
explicitly
stated
by
the
prime
fixer
of
national
policy,
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
whether
the
position
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
evidenced
the
reluctance
to
surrender
and
establish
source
of
taxes
or
whether
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice
was
motivated
by
an
unfounded
fear
that
the
regulation
program
under
the
internal
security
act
would
thereby
be
prejudiced,
does
not
fall
to
the
fact
that
both
internal
revenue
and
justice
had
not
evidenced
the
courage
of
the
clearly
expressed
congressional
convictions.
now,
the
petitioners
assert
that
congress
had
no
power
to
enact
the
communist
control
act
because
they
say
it
was
dealing
with
rights
granted
by
state
law
which
do
not
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce.
but
the
power
of
congress
with
relation
to
this
act
is
founded
on
a
much
broader
and
a
much
more
relevant
based
in
the
control
of
interstate
commerce,
the
federal
government
through
congress
has
a
constitutional
right
to
act
not
only
on
its
own
behalf,
but
also
on
behalf
of
the
states.
article
i
section
8
of
the
constitution
provides
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
provide
for
the
common
defense.
this
clause
has
been
held
to
authorize
legislation
against
attempts
to
subvert,
undermine
or
overthrow
the
government.
the
act
is
furthermore
a
manifestation
of
congressional
power
under
article
iv
section
4
of
the
constitution,
which
guarantees
to
every
state
in
the
union
or
republican
form
of
government.
and
by
virtue
of
this
provision,
the
duty
of
suppressing
sedition
and
subversion
within
a
state
rests
directly
upon
the
federal
government.
aside
from
the
question
of
constitutional
capacity
to
enact
the
law
such
as
that
which
is
here
involved,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
right
so
to
act
is
without
constitutional
limitation
and
is
not
judicially
reviewable.
this
court
held
in
ohio
against
the
akron
park
district
in
1930,
that
questions
arising
under
this
provision
are
political,
not
judicial
in
character
and
does
all
for
the
consideration
of
the
congress
and
not
the
courts.
obviously,
the
right
of
congress
to
act
or
the
wisdom
or
lack
of
wisdom
which
it
manifests
in
exercising
the
right
are
not
reviewable
by
this
or
any
other
court.
insofar
as
complaints
have
been
made
that
the
act
violates
the
tenth
amendment,
with
respect
to
the
reserved
power
of
the
states,
it
may
be
observed
that
given
a
clear
exercise
of
the
power,
as
i
believe
i
have
demonstrated
in
this
case,
the
tenth
amendment
imposes
no
limitations
on
that
power.
it
merely
gives
doctrinal
body
to
an
objection
that
congress
has
no
power
at
all
to
act
in
certain
areas.
it
states,
as
the
court
has
said,
"but
a
truism
that
all
is
retained
which
has
not
been
surrendered".
thus,
if
congress
has
power
to
act
in
a
given
area,
no
valid
objection
can
be
raised
because
of
the
fact
that
it
thereby
enters
a
field
which
ordinarily
had
been
regulated
by
the
states.
we
come
now
finally
to
the
question
of
constitutionality
of
the
act.
thus
far,
no
court
has
held
this
act
to
be
unconstitutional.
in
1954,
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
held
in
sullivan
v.
reese
(ph)
that
the
act
was
constitutional.
in
the
case
at
bar,
new
york's
court
of
appeals
expressly
refused
to
accept
the
petitioners'
argument
that
the
act
was
unconstitutional.
the
dissenting
judges
never
reached
the
question
of
constitutionality,
nor
for
that
matter,
did
the
appellate
division
reached
that
question.
although
the
appellate
division
made
a
very
definite
statement
it
had
no
doubt
that
this
could
constitutionally
be
done
accepting
for
the
difference
in
opinion
as
to
interpretation
of
the
act.
this
court,
too,
seems
implicitly
to
already
have
approved
the
communist
control
act.
in
pennsylvania
against
nelson,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1956,
it
was
held
that
by
the
enactment
of
the
smith
act,
the
internal
security
act
of
1950
and
the
communist
control
act
of
1954,
the
federal
government
preempted
the
field
of
prosecutions
for
sedition.
the
court
said,
?looking
to
all
of
them
in
the
aggregate,
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
congress
has
intended
to
occupy
the
field
of
sedition.?
taken
as
a
whole,
they
evince
a
congressional
plan
of
crucial
importance
to
the
question
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
is
that
fact
that
the
determination
in
the
nelson
case
was
based
on
a
congressional
plan,
which
included
the
communist
control
act,
and
implicit
in
the
acceptance
of
this
plan,
as
determinative
of
the
court's
conclusion,
was
the
acceptance
by
the
court
of
the
validity
of
all
elements
of
the
congressional
plan.
petitioners
assert
than
the
--
the
communist
control
act
constitutes
a
bill
of
attainder
and
an
ex
post
facto
law.
but
we
are
not
here
involved
in
a
criminal
case,
nor
are
we
dealing
with
matters
relating
to
punishment.
the
constitutional
provisions
do
not
apply
to
legislation
which
imposes
civil
disabilities.
to
strike
down
the
act,
the
legislature
must
have
demonstrated
penal
intent.
furthermore,
in
order
to
constitute
punishment,
this
court
has
held
that
the
proscription
must
have
retroactive
application.
this
act,
although
it
obviously
imposes
only
civil
disabilities
and
not
punishment,
nevertheless,
even
if
it
were
to
be
considered
to
impose
punishment,
is
clearly
not
retroactive
in
character
because
it
recognizes
the
continuing
criminal
character
of
the
party.
the
act
provides
for
inability
to
assert
in
the
future,
any
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
in
connection
with
transactions
which
take
place
subsequent
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
furthermore,
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
the
act
does
or
does
not
constitute
a
bill
of
attainder,
the
petitioners
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
question.
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
article
iv
section
2
deal
with
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
of
citizens
in
the
several
states.
time
and
again,
it
has
been
held
that
only
natural
persons
are
to
be
considered
citizens
under
these
provisions.
the
claim
is
also
made
of
a
violation
of
due
process
and
of
the
first
amendment.
despite
the
prescription
set
forth
in
the
act,
broad
as
it
is,
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
which
deprives
the
party
of
substantive
due
process
when
action
is
taken
against
it
to
terminate
a
right
which
it
claims.
that
is
precisely
what
is
taking
place
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
petitioners
were
afforded
the
opportunity
if
the
hearings
herein
to
oppose
the
termination
of
their
rights,
neither
the
industrial
commissioner
nor
the
referee
or
the
appeals
board
denied
them
the
right
to
present
their
case,
and
the
statute
itself
does
deny
them
their
right.
it
is
submitted
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
due
process
either
substantive
or
procedural.
however,
assuming
arguendo
that
there
were
present,
a
denial
of
due
process,
it
is
submitted
that
such
denial
would
be
proper
as
consonant
with
a
basic
postulate
which
underlies
the
due
process
provision.
movements
which
seek
to
crash
freedom
need
not
be
tolerated.
no
democratic
or
constitutional
principle
is
violated
when
a
democracy
acts
to
exclude
those
groups
from
entering
the
struggle
for
political
power,
which,
if
victorious,
will
not
permit
the
struggle
to
continue
in
accordance
with
the
democratic
way.
this
court
must
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
international
communism
has
made
tremendous
gains,
and
that
the
increasing
strength
of
the
soviet
world
places
us
in
constant
peril.
internal
subversion
has
been
the
main
weapon
by
which
communist
victories
have
been
won
in
many
foreign
countries.
it
now
threatens
the
stability
of
still
other
countries
in
all
parts
of
the
world.
recognizing
the
implications,
our
government
is
striving
to
meet
the
external
threat
and
recognizing
also
the
ever
present
and
ever
pressing
internal
threat,
congress,
the
executive
and
the
states
have
persistently
by
legislation
and
security
programs
attempted
to
combat
communism
at
home.
the
courts
have
refused
to
construe
the
bill
of
rights
so
as
to
interfere
with
a
reasonable
legislative
judgement
of
what
laws
are
essential
to
national
security.
this
is,
as
it
should
be,
for
without
observance
of
the
primary
duty
of
self-preservation
of
the
civil
liberties
of
the
individual,
would
be
meaningless,
for
they
must,
under
such
circumstances,
circum
to
the
totalitarian
regime,
which
must
inevitably
follow.
if
our
government
is
to
survive,
it
must
defend
itself
not
only
against
the
external
threat
but
against
the
dangerous
preliminary
attack
on
our
internal
security
which
is
the
peculiar
technique
of
the
communist
conspiracy
and
the
prelude
to
war.
it
is
submitted
that
the
constitution
should
be
construed
in
accordance
with
its
purpose
and
as
one
instrument,
the
basic,
primary
and
overwriting
purpose,
which
our
constitution
expressly
stated,
it
was
intended
to
subserve
and
accomplish,
was
to
secure
the
blessings
of
liberty
to
ourselves
and
our
posterity.
freedom
of
speech,
of
religion
and
of
the
press,
due
process
and
other
specific
civil
rights
which
are
protected
by
our
bill
of
rights
are
of
great
importance.
and
i
would
very
reluctantly
minimize
that
importance,
but
they
are
merely
elements
of
and
secondary
and
importance
to
the
most
fundamental
right
of
all,
freedom
itself.
here,
truly,
you
have
your
absolute,
your
impregnable,
your
unlimited
right.
call
it
balancing,
if
you
will,
as
you
did
?
as
recently
as
last
week
in
the
konigsberg
case,
but
i
do
not
consider
that
in
the
nature
of
things,
any
of
these
secondary
freedoms
alone
can
be
equated
with
the
fundamental
concept
of
freedom
itself.
the
basic
postulate
which
had
limit
and
control
the
specific
freedoms
including
due
process
and
first
amendment
rights
is
that
they
are
part
of
the
framework
for
a
constitutional
democracy
and
should,
therefore,
not
be
used
to
curve
the
power
of
congress
to
exclude
from
the
political
struggle
of
those
groups
which,
if
victorious,
would
crash
democracy,
deprive
us
of
our
fundamental
liberty
itself
and
impose
a
totalitarian
regime.
it
seems
clear
that
preoccupation
with
or
emphasis
upon
one
part
of
the
constitution
and
the
ignoring
of
another
equally
important
if
not
more
important
part,
so
as
to
endanger
national
survival,
constitutes
an
unrealistic
and
improper
method
of
applying
constitutional
standards
and
principles.
the
greatest
difficulty
in
recent
years
has
been
with
respect
to
the
situation
wherein
the
right
to
assert
infringement
of
civil
liberties
and
the
right
of
government
to
resist
violence
seemed
to
meet.
there
is
required
a
deeper
analysis
of
violence
and
nonviolence
and
their
relation
to
liberal
democracy.
in
the
dennis
and
yates
cases,
this
court
affirmed
the
basic
premise
of
our
political
system
that
changes
to
be
brought
about
by
nonviolent
constitutional
process.
no
government
can
assure
a
right
of
violent
to
overthrow.
the
guarantee
and
the
rights
are
mutually
abhorrent.
certain
political
philosophers
to
the
contrary
not
withstanding,
violent
overthrow
exists
outside
rather
than
inside
the
law.
therefore,
if
the
communist
party
is
a
conspiracy
for
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government
and
that
fact
is
now
established
beyond
peradventure
of
any
doubt,
its
advocacy
of
such
violence
colors
its
every
act
and
it
is
not
protected
under
the
bill
of
rights.
thank
you
very
much,
gentlemen.
