mr.
abt,
what
political
subdivisions
do
you
think
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
used
that
language?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
but
i
was
wondering
if
--
if
there
were
any
other
political
entities
other
than
the
insular
possessions
in
the
territories
that
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
apply
it
to.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sackman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
excluded
classification
under
which
the
petitioner
would
come
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
as
individuals
or
as
classifications?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
can
you
--
can
you
give
me
one
--
an
illustration
of
one
person
other
than
the
communist
party
whom
the
--
the
commissioner
would
have
power
to
exclude
from
coverage
where
--
where
that
party
is
not
included
in
one
of
these
exemptions.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
prepared
to
--
to
go
one
step
farther
and
say
that
if
it
were
not
for
section
3
of
the
--
of
the
communist
control
act,
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
your
commissioner
would
not
have
the
right
to
exclude?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
would
assert
to
this
court
that
he
has
a
power
or
that
he
doesn't?
you
got
to
take
one
position.
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
do
you
take?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
you
have
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
then,
as
much
as
you
rely
on
that,
what
is
your
state
law
that
you
rely
on,
either
legislative
or
judicial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
abt.
