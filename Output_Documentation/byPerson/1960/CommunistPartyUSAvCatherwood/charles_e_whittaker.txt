justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
we
have
here,
mr.
abt,
a
question
of
the
right
to
employ?
i
know
you've
argued
that.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
may
i
ask
you,
isn't
it
true
that
neither
the
federal
act
nor
the
new
york
unemployment
compensation
act
covers
all
employers?
some
may
be
and
are
excluded,
isn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
i
--
now,
then,
isn't
the
question
whether
there
may
be
a
proper
classification
to
exclude
the
communist
party
from
the
status
of
an
employer?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
but
it
is
argued
that
that
may
be
the
effect
of
section
3,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
having
that
right,
it
would
be
within
the
sovereign's
power
if
the
classification
was
reasonable
to
say
that
particular
employers
were
excluded
from
the
status.
