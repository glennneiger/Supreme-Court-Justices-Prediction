justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
abt,
if
i
may
refer
to
the
question
that
justice
harlan
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
or
take
your
example,
if
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
as
a
matter
of
state
construction--
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
a
state
statute
with
regard
to
virginia
as
a
subdivision
of
united
states,
there
would
be
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
so
far.
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
new
york
has
its
own
policy,
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
its
own
policy,
if
you
will
flagrantly
misconstrued
section
3
and
made
it
state
law,
that'd
be
a
different
question,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
it
did,
as
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
state
courts
have
construed
their
state
laws
in
conformity
with
federal
construction
of
federal
tax
laws
although
they're
not
bound
to
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm--
i'm
putting
a
hypothetical
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
case
and
not
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
it
upset
the
order
of
argument
if
you
have
planned
it
and
dealt
with
the
threshold
question
whether
this
is
a
determination
of
a
state
law,
whether
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
may
be
sustained
as
an
adjudication
on
the
state
law
would
then
in
--
in
its
own
--
in
its
own
good
time,
may
raise
constitutional
question
but
in
all
events,
whether
this
can
be
sustained
as
a
determination
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
to
be
valid
state
law
rather
than
the
compulsion
of
section
3
of
the
--
of
the
communist
control
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
between
--
you
follow
your
own
way
but
i
merely
suggest
that
between
using
a
federal
act
to
emphasize
state
action
and
inescapably
depending
on
a
construction
of
a
federal
law
are
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
any
general
clause
in
your
unemployment
insurance
act
enabling
the
commissioner
to
--
to
broaden
the
--
to
restrict
the
accepted
class?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
say
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
existing
legislation,
both
state
and
national,
may
impliedly
broaden
its
power,
at
least,
give
in
power
to
take
people
off
the
list,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
sackman,
does
the
statute
which
this
court
sustained
in
--
in
zimmerman
against
brian,
the
ku
klux
--
the
klan
statute
still
in
--
still
on
the
books
in
new
york?
do
you
know?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
statute
to
which
it
said
they
--
you
can
--
you
must
make
full
--
make
all
sort
of
disclosures.
now,
assuming
that
that
(inaudible)
exists,
you
--
your
argument
is
that
--
since
that
--
since
the
klan
would
be
operating
illegally
under
new
york
law
impliedly
your
industrial
commissioner
could
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
regarded
as
not
a
--
as
not
an
employer
within
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
intimate,
as
i
read
it,
didn't
suggest
that
this
was
an
exercise
of
the
discretionary
part
of
the
industrial
commissioner
not
subject
to
judicial
review.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
surely,
it
was
--
it
was
perfectly
--
perfectly
more
than
redundant
to
chief
judge
desmond
to
be
writing
this
opinion
if
only
could've
--
if
it
could've
been
thrown
off
on
the
ground,
this
is
within
the
ambit
of
non-reviewable
discretion
by
the
industrial
commissioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
precisely,
but
unfortunately
or
not,
if
the
court
could've
gone
off
merely
an
exercise
of
discretion,
they
wouldn't
have
to
--
they
could've
gone
off
on
that.
but
both
in
the
opinion
and
in
the
remittitur,
they
said
what
was
involved
and
what
was
in
issue
was
section
3
of
the
communist
party
control
act
and
its
validity,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
get
the
--
i
don't
get
the
direction
of
your
argument.
are
you
suggesting
--
then
you
tell
us
whether
you
are
saying
this
rest
on
a
state
ground
and
more
particularly,
the
state
ground
that
the
determination
of
the
classification
of
those
who
fall
within
the
state
unemployment
insurance
act
is
a
matter
vested
by
new
york
law
in
the
industrial
commissioner.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
take
that
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
that
means
--
all
that
--
all
i
get
from
that
statement
is,
that
in
the
first
instance,
the
industrial
commissioner
must
determine
whether
(inaudible)
subject
to
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sackman,
you
would
help
me
greatly
if
you
could
answer
this
question.
do
you
agree
or
disagree
with
the
proposition
that
the
case
before
us
that
this
court
must
decide
whether
new
york
was
compelled
by
section
3
of
the
communist
party
control
act
not
to
admit
the
communist
party
as
an
employer
under
the
new
york
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that
is
the
question
before
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
supremacy
--
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
require
the
industrial
commissioner
and
the
courts,
more
particularly
the
court
of
appeals,
to
find,
to
hold
that
the
federal
statute
to
which
section
3
of
the
communist
party
control
act
require
this
decision.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
now,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
a
question
of
new
york
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
didn't
say
that.
my
question
merely
says
that
would
be
new
york
law.
whether
it's
valid
new
york
law,
it's
a
different
story
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
would
be
another
lawsuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
we
agree
further
that
that
is
the
basis
of
the
decision
because
if
that
is
not
the
basis
of
the
decision
but
if
it
can
be
found
that
it
really
went
on
new
york
law,
then
we
have
to
pass
on
the
validity
of
the
new
york
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or,
in
the
alternative
as
we've
done
in
other
cases,
find
out
what
the
court
of
appeals
really
went
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
you're
sure
to
answer
that
mr.
abt
says
it
mean
something
to
his
clients
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
this?
the
other
--
they're
claiming
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
