mr.
john
j.
abt
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
sustaining
the
action
of
new
york's
industrial
commissioner
in
determining
that
the
petitioners
are
not
subject
to
taxation
under
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law
and
in
refusing
to
accept
further
tax
payments
from
them.
in
reaching
its
decision,
the
court
below
passed
on
the
interpretation
and
constitutionality
of
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act
and
the
validity
of
the
respondent's
action
under
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
case
presents
the
paradox
of
two
taxpayers,
the
petitioners
here,
who
are
resisting
a
tax
exemption
which
the
tax
collector,
the
respondent
here,
insists
on
thrusting
upon
them.
i
think
therefore
at
the
outset
i
should
perhaps
indicate
why
it
is
that
the
position
of
the
petitioners
is
far
from
quixotic.
the
action
of
the
respondent
injures
them
in
two
different
ways.
in
the
first
place,
it
triples
their
aggregate
--
aggregate
liability
for
unemployment
insurance
taxes
under
the
system
of
interrelated
state
and
federal
unemployment
insurance
taxation.
this
is
so,
because
the
state
exemption
relieves
them
of
taxation
at
the
rate
of
only
seven
tenths
of
1%
of
their
payrolls.
while
at
the
same
time,
it
deprives
them
of
a
credit
under
the
federal
tax
law
and
increases
their
federal
tax
tempo
from
three
tenths
of
1%
to
3%
of
their
payroll.
the
respondent
does
not
dispute
that
his
action
had
this
consequence.
and
i
spell
out
the
details
of
the
operation
of
the
interrelated
tax
laws
in
--
in
my
brief
at
pages
6
and
8
--
6
to
8.
in
the
second
place,
the
respondent's
action
handicaps
petitioner
in
--
petitioners
in
securing
and
retaining
employees
by
making
it
doubtful
at
this
whether
their
employees
are
covered
by
unemployment
insurance.
the
facts
are
that
for
20
years
following
the
enactment
of
new
york's
unemployment
insurance
law,
the
petitioners
were
taxed
under
it
and
their
employees
enjoyed
the
coverage
of
it.
in
january
1957,
the
attorney
general
of
new
york,
responding
to
an
inquiry
from
the
industrial
commissioner,
issued
an
opinion,
which
appears
as
appendix
b
to
my
brief.
the
opinion
ruled
that
petitioners
are
not
taxable
under
and
that
their
employees
are
not
covered
by
the
unemployment
insurance
law.
mr.
john
j.
abt
none
whatsoever
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
justice
harlan.
none
at
all.
and
that
--
and
i'll
--
i'll
point
out
at
the
moment.
the
attorney
general
did
not
rely
on
any
provision
of
the
unemployment
insurance
law
itself.
the
ground
for
his
conclusion
was
that
petitioners
are
engaged
in
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
of
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
new
york
by
force
and
violence.
and
therefore,
in
the
words
of
the
attorney
general,
and
i
quote
them,
"it
would
be
an
anomaly
in
law
not
to
say
a
moral
and
against
public
policy
for
the
communist
party
and
its
employees
to
enjoy
the
advantages
and
benefits
of
this
public
insurance
program."
those
were
the
sole
grounds
on
which
the
attorney
general
rested
his
opinion.
acting
pursuant
to
this
opinion,
the
respondent,
the
industrial
commissioner
denied
the
application
of
one
albertson
for
insurance
benefits
based
upon
his
employment
by
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states,
one
of
the
petitioners
whom
i
refer
to
as
the
national
party.
the
industrial
commissioner
also
notified
both
the
national
and
the
state
party,
both
of
the
petitioners
here,
that
he
had
suspended
their
registrations
as
employers
liable
to
unemployment
insurance
contributions
and
that
they
should
make
no
further
contributions.
i
should
explain
at
this
point
that
the
term
"contribution"
is
used
in
the
state
law
to
denote
the
tax
which
the
law
levies
on
employers'
unaccountable
wages
which
the
employers
pay
to
their
employees.
and
registration
is
simply
an
administrative
device
which
the
respondent,
the
industrial
commissioner
uses
to
identify
employers
who
are
liable
for
contributions
for
collection
and
accounting
purposes.
both
albertson,
the
claimant
for
unemployment
insurance,
and
the
petitioner
appeal
the
rulings
of
the
industrial
commissioner
to
an
unemployment
insurance
referee
who
consolidated
the
three
cases
for
hearing.
the
respondent
offered
no
evidence
of
the
hearing
but
rested
solely
on
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
the
only
evidence
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
petitioners'
activities
was
a
testimony
of
albertson
that
his
duty
is
consisted
in
studying
trends
in
the
labor
movement
and
analyzing
proposed
labor
legislation.
the
referee
sustained
the
determinations
of
the
industrial
commissioner
not
on
the
attorney
general's
criminal
conspiracy
theory
but
under
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act.
section
3
provides
"that
whatever
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
which
have
heretofore
been
granted
to
said
party,"
that
is
the
communist
party,
"or
any
subsidiary
organization
by
reason
of
the
laws
of
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof
are
hereby
terminated."
the
referee
held
that
this
section
terminated
the
rights
of
petitioners
to
have
employees
and
therefore
extinguish
their
liability
to
taxation
as
employers.
the
unemployment
insurance
appeal
board
affirmed,
the
appellate
division
refers
unanimously
holding
that
section
3
did
not
terminate
petitioners'
liability
to
taxation
as
employers
or
the
right
of
their
employees
to
unemployment
insurance
coverage.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
division
as
to
the
petitioners.
let's
say
holding
the
petitioners
who
are
not
liable
to
taxation
under
the
unemployment
insurance
law.
however,
it
affirmed
the
decision
that
albertson
was
entitled
to
insurance
coverage
based
on
his
employment
by
the
communist
party.
the
court
handed
down
three
separate
opinions,
two
judges
joining
in
each.
the
seventh
member
of
the
court
did
not
participate
because
he
had
been
the
presiding
justice
--
presiding
judge
rather
in
the
appellate
division
when
the
case
was
heard
there.
the
prevailing
opinion
which
was
--
which
was
written
by
chief
justice
desmond
construes
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act
as
terminating
petitioners'
status
as
employers
under
the
state
law
for
--
as
judge
desmond
said,
"for
whatever
value
that
status
may
have".
the
opinion
holds
that
section
3
as
so
construed
as
constitution
--
constitutional.
as
to
albertson,
however,
judge
desmond
ruled
that
since
his
employment
by
the
communist
party
antedated
the
action
of
the
industrial
commissioner,
although
it
was
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
communist
control
act,
it
would
be
unreasonably
punitive
to
deny
him
his
insurance.
the
second
opinion
written
by
judge
van
voorhis
agrees
with
the
prevailing
opinion
as
to
the
construction
and
constitutionality
of
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act.
it
holds
however
that
since
section
3
deprived
petitioners
of
the
capacity
to
be
employers
and
to
enter
into
an
employer-employee
relationship,
albertson
wasn't
entitled
to
this
insurance
because
he
wasn't
an
employee.
the
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
fuld
holds
that
section
3
did
not
terminate
petitioners'
liability
to
taxation
under
the
state
law
or
the
right
of
their
employees
to
unemployment
insurance
coverage.
now,
in
as
much
as
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
turned
on
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute,
i
think
that
perhaps
it
was
appropriate
to
start
my
discussion
with
an
examination
of
the
construction
which
has
been
given
to
section
3
by
the
federal
agencies
having
primary
responsibility
for
the
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
this
federal
statute.
when
president
eisenhower
signed
the
communist
control
act
in
august
of
1954,
he
stated
that
its
full
impact
would
require
further
careful
study.
it
seems
apparent
that
such
study,
or
any
case
--
apparently
not
such
study
has
resulted
in
no
action
of
any
kind
by
the
federal
authorities
to
apply
section
3's
fiat
deprivation
of
rights,
privileges
and
immunities.
no
action
of
any
kind
has
been
taken
by
the
federal
government.
furthermore,
this
has
been
inherent
from
the
inception
of
this
proceeding
that
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
rejects
the
construction
given
to
section
3
by
the
respondent
here
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york.
for
as
the
evidence
showed
and
as
both
of
the
state
courts
found,
the
bureau
has
continued
to
tax
the
petitioner
as
employers
under
the
federal
unemployment
insurance
--
unemployment
tax
act.
that
--
this
is
the
position
not
only
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue,
but
also
the
department
of
justice
is
established
by
the
letter
from
the
solicitor
general
to
the
clerk
of
this
court
declining
to
intervene
or
file
an
amicus
brief
in
this
proceeding.
the
letter
states,
and
i
quote
it,
"there
is
no
need
to
file
a
brief
describing
the
practice
of
federal
agencies
in
interpreting
the
statute
for
this
information
is
already
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
judge
fuld
in
the
court
of
appeals."
judge
fuld,
of
course,
wrote
the
dissenting
opinion.
and
the
solicitor
general's
reference
as
to
a
passage
from
that
opinion
which
first
restates
the
respondent's
contention
that
section
3
terminated
the
petitioners'
status
as
employers
and
their
liability
for
unemployment
insurance,
and
then
continues
as
follows,
and
i
quote
just
few
sentences
from
judge
fuld's
opinion,
"this
contention,
referring
to
the
respondent's
contention,
is
unreasonable.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
significant
that
the
federal
authorities,
admittedly
aware
of
the
industrial
commissioner's
position,
have
taken
one
diametrically
opposed
and
continued
to
recognize
the
communist
party
as
an
employer
subject
to
the
federal
act."

and
--
and
the
solicitor
general's
letter
which
was
written
to
the
court
on
the
april
10th,
a
few
weeks
ago,
states
flatly
that
the
federal
--
the
interpretation
of
the
act
by
the
federal
agencies
is,
that
is,
the
communist
control
act,
is
that
it
has
no
effect
on
--
on
their
taxability
under
the
federal
tax
act.
the
--
the
--
that
--
that
follows
from
the
reference
of
judge
fuld's
opinion,
which
i
have
just
read
to
the
court.
the
correctness
of
the
federal
interpretation
of
section
3
as
well
as
what
judge
fuld
characterized
as
the
unreasonableness
of
the
respondent's
position
will
appear
from
an
examination
of
the
text
of
the
statute
of
section
3.
first,
however,
i
think
it
is
an
order
to
give
the
court
a
very
brief
résumé
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
extraordinary
piece
of
legislation.
the
communist
control
act
was
passed
in
august
1954
during
the
closing
days
of
the
83rd
congress
just
before
congress
adjourned
for
the
congressional
elections
and
national
elections
of
that
year.
it
originated
in
senator
butler's
bill
to
amend
the
internal
security
act
by
adding
provisions
with
reference
to
so-called
"communist-infiltrated
organizations".
in
the
course
of
the
senate
debate,
senator
humphrey
offered
an
amendment
in
the
form
of
an
addition
to
the
bill
which
was
adopted.
the
court
will
perhaps
recall
from
the
discussion
in
the
noto
and
scales
cases
in
this
term
that
the
heart
of
the
humphrey
amendment
appeared
as
section
3
of
the
senate
bill
and
made
membership
in
the
communist
party
a
crime.
now,
the
house
rejected
section
3
of
the
senate
bill
when
it
was
advised
that
that
--
the
section
in
that
form
would
jeopardize
the
registration
provisions
of
the
internal
security
act.
it
substituted
for
the
senate
version
of
section
3,
the
text
of
section
3,
which
now
appears
in
the
act,
the
deprivation
of
rights,
privileges
and
immunities.
there
was
no
committee
consideration
of
this
section
either
in
the
house
or
in
the
senate.
representative
celler,
who,
at
that
time,
was
the
senior
minority
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
described
the
situation
in
the
house
in
the
following
words,
and
i
quote,
"the
judiciary
committee
never
saw
the
instant
bill.
it
was
cropped
up
over
the
weekend.
it
was
cut
and
recut,
furbished
and
refurbished,
shuffled
and
reshuffled.
it
is
indeed
a
hodgepodge.
now,
we
are
in
a
way
buying
a
(inaudible).
what
does
this
field
really
entails?
nobody
really
knows."
a
reading
of
the
debates
fully
confirms
representative
celler's
statement
through
a
number
of
congressmen
asserted
their
personal
opinions
as
to
what
section
3
meant.
these
comments,
of
course,
would
be
of
no
weight
even
if
they
were
consistent
with
each
other.
but
in
this
instance,
they
were
mutually
contradictory
consisting
of
senator
morse
observed,
and
i
quote
him,
"of
almost
every
possible
conflicting
point
of
view
which
human
minds
can
imagine
or
can
cut".
but
the
legislative
history
does
therefore
and
about
all
that
it
does
is
to
document
senator,
chief
author's
comment,
and
i
quote
him,
"that
we
are
giving
a
clear
and
impressive
picture
of
how
legislation
should
not
be
written."
nevertheless,
one
fact
emerges
from
the
text
of
section
3
and
from
the
legislative
history,
certainly,
whatever
else
congress
may
have
intended
by
that
section's
deprivation
of
rights,
it
certainly
did
not
intend
to
relieve
the
communist
party
of
its
liabilities
and
least
of
all
of
its
liabilities
of
taxation.
two
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
a
unanimous
appellate
division
so
held.
now,
they
are
holding
as
reinforced,
i
think,
by
the
cases
that
respondent
cites
in
his
brief,
the
familiar
cases
to
the
effect
that
an
activity
otherwise
taxable
is
not
relieved
from
the
taxation
because
the
activity
is
unlawful.
for
--
under
these
decisions,
petitioner
would
not
have
been
exempt
from
employment
taxes
on
the
wages
they
pay
even
if
section
3
had
done
which
it
--
what
it
doesn't
and
the
terms
prohibited
the
petitioners
from
having
employees.
the
respondent
argues
nevertheless
that
the
obligation
to
pay
employment
taxes
arises
only
from
the
exercise
of
a
legal
right,
the
legal
right
to
be
an
employer.
his
contention
is
that
section
3
terminated
this
legal
right
of
petitioners
and
therefore
extinguished
their
common
liability
to
taxation.
this
contention
rests
first
of
all
on
the
proposition
that
the
unemployment
insurance
tax
is
a
tax
on
the
exercise
of
a
legal
right
to
employ
others
and
not
simply
on
the
existence
of
a
de
facto
employer-employee
relationship.
it's
unnecessary
to
--
i
think
to
discuss
this
rather
metaphysical
distinction
for
it
is
clear
that
section
3
does
not
terminate
petitioners'
legal
right
to
be
employers.
this
is
two
or
three
distinct
reasons.
first,
section
3
does
not
purport
to
terminate
all
of
the
petitioners'
rights
but
only
those,
and
i
quote
section
3,
"which
have
heretofore
been
granted
by
reason
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof".
now,
the
right
of
a
natural
person
to
employ
others
is
not
a
right
granted
by
government.
on
the
contrary,
it
is
a
natural
or
inherent
right,
one
of
the
inalienable
rights
with
which,
as
a
declaration
of
--
of
independents
declares,
all
men
are
endowed
by
their
creator.
and
as
the
declaration
also
teaches,
such
rights
are
not
granted
by
government.
on
the
contrary,
governments
were
instituted
among
men
to
secure
such
rights.
consequently,
if
petitioners
were
natural
persons,
their
right
to
be
employers
would
not
be
affected
by
section
3
which
terminates
only
rights
granted
by
government.
now,
the
fact
is
that
petitioners
are
unincorporated
associations.
and
in
new
york,
an
unincorporated
association
is
not
an
entity
like
a
corporation
which
owes
its
franchise
to
the
state.
as
chief
judge
desmond
does
squarely
held
in
another
and
earlier
case,
an
unincorporated
association,
and
i
quote
him,
"is
not
an
artificial
person
and
has
no
existence
independent
of
its
members".
accordingly,
the
right
that
is
involved
here
is
a
right
to
petitioners'
members
collectively
to
employ
others.
that
would
be
true
in
the
case
of
a
partnership.
that
right
is
as
much
of
an
inherent
right
as
a
right
of
a
single
individual
to
be
an
employer.
and
hence,
it's
not
a
right
which
section
3
purports
to
terminate.
in
the
second
place
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
not
arguing
the
question
of
constitutional
power
here
at
all,
mr.
justice
black.
and
of
course
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
the
government
is
subject
to
due
process.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
--
i'm
talking
about
the
question
of
statutory
construction
not
--
not
about
the
constitutional
question.
of
course,
congress
is
subject
to
due
process,
other
constitutional
provisions
has
a
right
to
regulate
a
natural
right
just
as
it
has
the
right
to
--
to
regulate
right
granted
by
the
government.
that
--
that's
not
the
issue
at
this
point.
here,
i'm
talking
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
about
what
congress
did
and
not
what
congress
could
do.
mr.
john
j.
abt
pardon.
mr.
john
j.
abt
right.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
my
argument
is
that
--
that
congress
was
not
--
not
attempting
here
to
--
to
affect
a
right,
a
so-called
natural
or
inherent
right
because
the
language
of
section
3
refers
not
to
all
rights
of
the
communist
party
but
only
to
those
rights
which
are
granted
to
it
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
serve
any
political
subdivision.
and
the
right
to
be
an
employer
is
not
a
right
which
was
granted
to
petitioners
by
government.
it's
the
right
they
enjoyed
without
any
statutory
grant
or
enjoy
without
any
statutory
grant.
mr.
john
j.
abt
no,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i'm
not
talking
about
power
--
their
power
to
regulate.
i'm
talking
about
what
congress
tried
to
do
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
or
intended
to
do
under
--
in
this
statute.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
government
has
--
the
government
doesn't
grant
it.
a
man
enjoys
the
right
to
employ
others
quite
apart
from
any
grant
of
government.
it's
a
right
that
he
enjoys
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
is
a
human
being,
he's
a
man.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
j.
abt
surely.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
is
no
contention
here,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
any
provision
either
of
the
new
york
act
or
of
the
federal
tax
act
as
such
excludes
the
communist
party
as
an
employer
as
it
excludes
farmers
and
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
and
employers
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
j.
abt
the
--
the
state
argues
that
that
was
the
effect
of
section
3,
and
on
one
of
my
arguments
that
that
is
not
the
effect
of
section
3
is
that
section
3
purports
the
deal
only
with
such
rights
as
granted
to
the
communist
party
by
government.
and
in
my
view,
the
right
to
employ
persons
is
not
a
right
that
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
enjoys
by
virtue
of
a
grant
from
the
government.
we
enjoy
it
because,
as
a
declaration
of
independent
says,
it's
one
of
the
inalienable
rights.
mr.
john
j.
abt
surely.
i'm
not
--
i'm
--
i'm
not
--
in
trying
to
explain
to
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
congress
has
the
power
to
do
that,
i'm
only
talking
about
what
congress
actually
did
in
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation.
that's
my
--
my
only
point,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
surely.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
think
there
seems
to
be
a
fourteenth
amendment
question
here,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
whether
your
question
to
me
is
address
to
that
proposition.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
no
provision
of
new
york.
mr.
john
j.
abt
there
are
only
two
possible
bases
for
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
the
one
that's
emphasized
most,
and
it's
perfectly
explicit,
is
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act.
now,
it
maybe,
and
there
are
some
indications
both
in
the
opinion
and
certainly
in
their
remittitur
that
the
court
was
saying
also
that
quite
a
part
from
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act,
we
think
that
this
was
proper
state
action
but
somehow
or
another,
the
attorney
general
had
the
power
to
--
to
render
the
opinion
that
he
did
and
the
industrial
commissioner
had
the
power
to
--
to
do
what
he
did
without
any
authorization,
any
specific
authorization
by
the
state
legislature.
whether
--
whether
the
court
really
meant
that
or
not,
i
don't
know,
but
that
--
that
maybe
a
possible
interpretation
of
their
opinion.
and
that's
how
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
quips
into
the
case.
now,
in
the
second
place,
and
i'm
again
--
i'm
still
addressing
myself
to
the
--
the
question
of
statutory
interpretation
as
to
whether
section
3
terminates
the
right
of
the
communist
party
to
be
an
employer.
and
my
second
point
in
that
connection
is
that
even
if
the
right
of
the
petitioners
here
to
be
employers
as
a
right
granted
by
government
rather
than
a
natural
or
inherent
right,
it's
a
right
granted
by
new
york
and
not
by
the
united
states
and
is,
therefore,
not
affected
by
section
3.
section
3
purports
to
terminate
all
rights
granted
by
petitioners,
and
i
quote,
"by
reason
of
the
laws
of
the
unites
states
or
any
political
subdivision
thereof".
as
my
brief
shows,
the
states
are
not
political
subdivisions
of
the
united
states
within
any
accepted
meaning
of
that
term.
in
addition,
both
the
communist
control
act
and
elsewhere,
the
congress
has
shown
that
understands
the
distinction
between
a
political
subdivision
and
the
state
and
doesn't
use
one
term
when
it
means
the
other.
additionally,
a
ruling
that
section
3
applies
to
all
rights
grant
of
petitioners
by
state
law
is
to
be
avoided
because
it
would
give
rise
to
a
great
constitutional
question.
congress,
of
course,
may
not
regulate
much
less
prohibited
the
exercise
of
a
right
which
is
unrelated
to
the
execution
of
one
of
its
granted
powers.
for
example,
congress
would
seem
clearly
to
lack
the
competence
to
prohibit
the
petitioners
from
implying
a
man
to
do
the
job
that
albertson,
the
claimant,
had
been
performing
in
this
case
as
to
say
to
study
trends
in
the
labor
movement
and
analyze
proposed
labor
legislation,
not
be
within
the
competence
of
congress
to
prohibit
the
employment
of
a
man
for
that
purpose.
it
appears,
therefore,
that
constitutional
considerations
applicable
to
employment
like
this
militate
against
any
interpretation
of
section
3
making
it
applicable
to
all
rights
granted
under
state
laws.
mr.
john
j.
abt
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
what
congress
had
in
mind
about
any
provision
of
this
act,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
suppose
the
--
the
territories
and
possessions
which
are,
in
fact,
political
subdivisions.
but
surely,
a
state
is
not
a
political
subdivision.
i
think
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
is,
if
i
may
say
so,
a
little
insensitive
to
this
question
of
nomenclature.
i
can
hardly
imagine
the
attorney
general
of
virginia,
let
us
say,
in
getting
before
this
court
and
conceding
that
his
state
was
nothing
but
a
political
subdivision
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
j.
abt
only
--
they
are
the
only
ones
that
the
court
need
that
i
can't
think
of.
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
in
the
district
of
columbia,
of
course.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
abt
in
--
mr.
john
j.
abt
but
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
done
it.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
might
--
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
as
to
how
it
could
mechanically,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
john
j.
abt
--
but
it
didn't
hear.
certainly
it
didn't
hear.
mr.
john
j.
abt
new
york
--
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
did
just
the
other
way
around.
mr.
john
j.
abt
alright.
mr.
john
j.
abt
yes.
alright.
now,
on
the
third
place,
i
think
it's
evident
from
the
tax
of
the
communist
control
act
as
a
whole
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
terminate
the
right
of
the
communist
party
to
be
an
employer.
but
on
the
contrary,
contemplated
that
the
party
would
continue
to
have
and
to
act
through
employees
notwithstanding
section
3.
i
discussed
the
relevant
provisions
of
the
communist
control
act
in
my
brief
and
shan't
repeat
the
analysis
here.
thus,
for
the
three
reasons
i've
indicated,
the
tax
of
the
communist
control
act
refused
the
respondent's
interpretation
of
section
3
and
supports
that
of
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
and
the
department
of
justice.
moreover,
congress
acquiesced
in
the
federal
--
in
the
federal
interpretation
in
1956
when
it
enacted
comprehensive
amendments
to
the
social
security
act
and
the
insurance
contributions
act.
before
discussing
these
amendments,
i
should
say
that
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
has
continued
to
tax
the
petitioners,
the
communist
parties,
as
employers
under
the
insurance
contributions
act
as
well
as
under
the
unemployment
tax
act.
furthermore,
subsequent
to
the
enactment
of
the
communist
control
act,
and
prior
to
the
passage
of
these
1956
social
security
act
amendments,
a
social
security
administration
referee
ruled
that
the
--
that
employees
of
the
petitioners
are
entitled
to
old-age
benefits
based
on
their
employment
by
the
petitioners.
now,
if
congress
had
thought
that
the
bureau
and
the
referee
were
wrong
and
that
section
3
had
terminated
the
petitioners'
liability
to
social
security
taxation
and
the
right
of
their
employees
to
coverage,
it
could
have
rectified
the
error
when
it
enacted
the
comprehensive
1956
amendments
to
the
social
security
act.
instead,
congress
adopted
amendments
which
are
wholly
consistent
with
the
federal
interpretation
of
section
3
of
the
communist
control
act,
that
is
to
say
that
that
section
doesn't
affect
petitioners'
liability
to
employment
taxes,
for
what
the
amendments
do
is
to
exclude
from
social
security
coverage
and
taxations
services
in
the
employee
of
an
organization
subsequent
to
the
date
on
which
it
is
finally
ordered
to
register
under
the
internal
security
act.
thus,
as
far
as
the
social
security
amendments
are
concerned,
the
petitioner
and
its
employees
are
not
presently
accepted
from
coverage
either
tax,
that
is,
petitioners
from
taxation
and
their
employees
from
old-age
benefits,
and
they
will
not
be
accepted
from
coverage
unless
the
communist
party
of
the
united
states
is
finally
ordered
to
register
under
the
internal
security
act.
that
seems
pretty
obvious
that
congress
would
have
not
--
would
not
have
adopted
this
amendment
unless
an
agreement
with
the
interpretation
given
section
3
by
the
federal
agencies,
it
believed
that
that
section
have
not
affected
the
petitioners'
liability
to
taxation
as
employers
or
the
right
of
their
employees
to
social
insurance.
so
much
for
the
question
of
the
interpretation
of
section
3.
of
course,
should
the
court
reject
the
federal
interpretation
of
the
section
and
the
arguments
that
i
advance
would
be
obliged
to
pay
something
to
the
underlying
constitutional
questions.
i
discussed
these
in
my
brief,
and
i
don't
propose
to
dwell
on
them
now
except
to
outline
them
very
briefly.
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
section
3
violates
the
constitution
in
a
number
of
ways.
first,
it
denies
the
petitioners'
substantive
due
process
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
evil
with
which
the
communist
control
act
purports
the
deal,
as
stated
in
section
2,
is
conduct
of
the
communist
party
said
to
endanger
the
national
security.
there's
a
long
recital
of
these
dangers
in
section
2.
but
section
3
is
not
restricted
to
measures
for
the
prohibition
or
control
of
such
conduct.
on
its
face
and
as
construed
below,
it
terminates
the
right
of
the
party
to
engage
through
employees
or
otherwise
in
an
entirely
peaceable
and
innocent
activities.
hence,
section
3
violates
the
due
process
principle,
which
--
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wants
to
put
it,
prohibits
legislation
from
throwing
a
baby
out
of
the
bath
or
burning
down
the
house
to
roast
the
pig.
section
3
also
denies
petitioners'
procedural
due
process
because
it
deprives
them
of
valuable
rights
and
privileges
on
the
charge
made
in
section
2
that
they
are
criminal
conspirators
without
according
them
a
hearing
in
the
truth
of
the
charge.
next,
section
3
is
both
a
bill
of
attainder
and
an
ex
post
facto
law.
the
controlling
question
here
is
whether
the
section
imposes
punishment.
section
2
of
the
act
finds
the
communist
party
by
name
to
be
guilty
of
seditious
conspiracy
and
declares
that
it
should
be
outlawed.
the
deprivation
of
rights
which
section
3
decrees
is
absolute
and
permanent.
no
escape
from
it
is
possible.
impeccable
future
conduct
by
the
party
will
not
restore
the
rights
which
section
3
denies.
furthermore,
since
section
3
scripts
the
petitioners
of
all
of
their
rights
indiscriminately,
it
is
clear
that
the
legislation
was
aimed
at
them
and
not
at
any
particular
conduct
or
activity.
finally,
a
glance
at
the
house
and
senate
debates
is
enough
to
dispel
any
possible
doubt
that
the
purpose
of
the
legislation
was
punitive.
indeed,
section
3
has
every
one
of
the
indicia
of
punishment
to
which
this
court
has
adverted
in
the
line
of
cases
from
cummings
against
missouri
to
flemming
versus
nestor
of
the
last
term.
the
final
constitutional
infirmity
of
section
3
i've
already
indicated
as
applied
below,
it
is
unconstitutional
because
it
terminates
rights
not
within
the
competence
of
congress
to
affect.
in
conclusion,
i
should
like
to
say
just
a
few
more
words
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
which
works
in
the
case
in
which
i've
discussed
briefly
in
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
harlan.
it's
in
the
case
because
there
are
several
vague
indications
in
the
prevailing
opinion
below
that
the
action
of
the
industrial
commissioner
could
be
sustained,
i
think
this
is
what
the
opinion
says,
i'm
not
sure,
could
be
sustained
as
state
action
without
regard
to
the
communist
control
act.
mr.
john
j.
abt
well,
page
38,
mr.
justice
harlan.
there's
one
indication.
the
court
says,
the
appellate
division
recognized
in
its
opinion
that
the
state
might,
by
appropriate
steps,
prevent
the
communist
parties
from
engaging
in
any
activity
or
existence.we
think
that
the
state
of
new
york
has
already
done
so.
now,
i
don't
--
they're
not
--
they
don't
tell
you
very
clearly
as
to
what
the
state
of
new
york
--
how
the
state
of
new
york
had
done
so.
all
i
say
is,
the
attorney
general,
the
highest
law
officer,
argues
to
us
in
this
appeal
that
the
unemployment
insurance
officers
acted
validly
in
denying
for
the
recognition
of
the
communist
parties.
then,
in
addition
to
that
statement,
the
facts
that
the
court
distinguishes
or
--
or
says
rather
that
albertson
is
entitled
of
this
insurance
because
his
employment
occurred
before
the
action
taken
by
the
industrial
commissioner
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
court
was
relying
on
something
that
the
industrial
commissioner
did
rather
merely
--
and
merely
on
section
3.
and
in
any
event,
the
court
in
its
remittitur
states
that
it
had
decided
that
respondent's
action
didn't
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so,
apparently,
somehow
or
another
it
considered
this
as
a
matter
of
state
action.
now,
my
brief
shows
that
if
--
if
the
respondent's
action
is
viewed
as
state
action,
its
--
his
action
must
rest
on
the
criminal
conspiracy
theory
that
was
advanced
by
the
attorney
general
on
this
opinion,
that
is
to
the
communist
party
as
a
criminal
conspiracy
and
therefore
behave
more
against
public
policy
permits
it
and
its
employees
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
the
law.
and
my
brief
also
shows
that
this
theory
contravenes
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
respondent's
brief
contains
a
lengthy
defense
of
the
--
this
criminal
conspiracy
theory.
but
it
states
that
respondent
relies
solely
on
section
3
of
the
federal
act
of
a
justification
for
his
action.
now,
if
the
court
accepts
the
respondent's
concession,
then
no
state
action
is
involved
here
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
drops
out
of
the
case.
thank
you.
mr.
john
j.
abt
i
have
nothing
further,
mr.
chief
justice.
