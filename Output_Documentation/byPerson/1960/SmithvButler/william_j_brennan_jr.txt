justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
the
basis
of
liability
on
this
account,
if
that
were
the
case,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
ground
of
the
proofs,
no
one
challenges
deficiency
of
the
proofs
to
sustain
the
allegation.
just
in
fact,
they
alleged
a
cause
of
action
of
the
fela.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
first
two,
to
--
what
approves
the
court
an
allegation
of
the
time
you
say
that
you
might
have
made,
namely
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
that
was
been
an
improper
field
test
or
let
the
--
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
conducted
improperly
or
so
forth.did
it
approve
actually
to
introduce
at
the
trial
so
that
the
basic
courts
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
take
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
did
you
take
any
exception
to
the
evidence
that
were
actually
introduced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
--
were
any
objections
made
on
this
court
you're
now
making
as
to
the
first
two
allegations
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
those
do
not
set
up
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
leave
(h)
open,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
that
--
but
what
this
mean
when
it
--
the
court
of
appeals
speaks
about
safe
place
to
work
was
the
only
thing
opened?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
whether
the
appellee
provided
a
reasonably
safe
place
for
appellee
to
work
or
perform
the
duties
assigned
to
him,
and
that's
what
governed
by
(c),
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(a)
and
(b).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
second
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
didn't
object
as
i
recall
it.
i
haven't
read
all
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
let
me
ask
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
find
in
--
anything
from
(c)
to
(h)
an
allegation
in
the
form
that
mr.
justice
whittaker
put
it
to
you,
namely,
an
allegation
that
negligence
in
the
manner
of
conducting
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
doesn't
say
anything
about
negligence
in
the
manner
of
conducting
it
necessarily,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unlike
the
other
things
besides
that,
but
in
any
event,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
why
isn't
this
evidence
taken
or
pages
of
it,
without
objection,
that
evidence
which
went
to
the
manner
of
conducting
a
test?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
you
did
--
well,
i
--
i
thought
--
i
thought
you
made
the
motion
for
direct
--direction
of
verdict.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
initially
on
the
ground
of
its
insufficiency.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
when
it
was
introduced,
that
is
the
evidence
going
to
the
manner
in
which
the
test
was
conducted.
am
i
correct
that
there
was
no
objection
on
the
part
of
defense
counsel
to
its
introduction?
