justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
did
the
florida
supreme
court
ever
determine
the
question
of
whether,
under
the
first
two
assignments,
there
could
be
negligence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
they
merely
said
that
was
not
a
justiciable
issue.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
makes
all
the
difference
to
me.
i
understood
that
your
--
you
have
several
assignments
of
negligence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
the
first
two
assignments
were
in
negligently
requiring
the
field
test
and
second,
negligently
allowing
the
field
test.
now,
i
understood
that
the
florida
court
did
not
determine
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
that
conduct
could
be
negligence
but
on
the
contrary,
he
said
it
was
not
a
justiciable
issue
in
this
fela
case
but
that
it
was
redressable
if
--
at
all,
only
before
the
labor
adjustment
board.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
suppose
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
never
did
determine
that
question,
did
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
did
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
do
you
explain
this
language
from
the
opinion?
this
is
what
i
was
referring
to.
there
was
no
justiciable
issue
at
least
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
that
could
be
raised
as
to
the
propriety
or
right
of
the
appellant
to
give
the
test.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
does
not
that
say
we're
not
determining
the
issue
of
negligence
on
these
assignments
but
are
holding
instead?
well,
it
doesn't
present
the
justiciable
issue
under
the
act?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
here's
--
i
thought
this
was
a
point
in
your
favor
for
i
think
the
court
in
florida
has
a
right
to
say
what
or
is
negligence
and
what
is
not
but
i
think
it
has
no
right
to
say
that
he
doesn't
have
power
to
use
the
question.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
they
said
one
of
the
other
now
which
was
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
would
that
the
florida
court
would
have
to
determine
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
negligence
here
was
charged.
and
they
have
the
power
to
decide
that
question
but
they
had
no
power
to
refuse
to
hear
it.
now,
did
they
refuse
to
hear
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
have
you
to
say,
mr.
frates
about
disposition
at
the
second
trial
on
first
case
for
whatever
reasons,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
reversed
in
the
mandate
holding
that
--
you
didn't
have
the
cause
of
action
at
least
cognizable
before
them
on
your
assignments
one
and
two,
am
i
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
now
then,
you
then
said
that
the
second
trial,
our
whole
position
in
this
case
is
that
requiring
this
fellow
to
take
this
test
and
conduct
this
thing
was
the
negligence
in
the
case
and
the
violation
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
my
question
really
is
this.
what
have
you
say
about
the
first
judgment
being
the
law
of
the
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
went
3000
feet?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
understand,
if
i
may
ask,
the
first
two
assignments
of
negligence
under
paragraph
(5)
of
the
complaint
record
2,
to
charge
negligence
in
the
manner
of
conducting
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
or
negligence
in
requiring
any
test
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
he
doesn't
say
in
those
assignments.
he
does
in
later
assignments.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
did
what?
he
didn't
want
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
wahl
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
i
wonder
if
it
isn't
possible
or
necessary
to
observe
that
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
took
the
view
what
the
second
trial
that
counts
--
that
assignments
one
and
two
of
paragraph
(5)
tried
something
different
than
the
remainder
when
he
said,
they
--
record
337.
in
other
words,
our
whole
position
in
this
case
is
that
requiring
this
fellow
to
take
this
test
and
conduct
this
thing
was
the
negligence
in
the
case
and
the
violation
of
the
federal
employees'
liability
act.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
i'm
saying
--
i'm
suggesting
is
--
is
not
a
matter
of
construction
by
plaintiff's
counsel
that
assignments
(a)
and
(b)
were
different
than
the
others.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
frates,
are
those
not
the
assignments
that
you
abandoned?
