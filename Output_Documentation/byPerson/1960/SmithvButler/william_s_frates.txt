mr.
william
s.
frates
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
is
here
asking
this
honorable
court
to
set
aside
a
final
judgment
for
the
respondent,
reverse
the
opinion
of
the
florida
district
court
of
appeals
and
reinstate
the
jury
verdict
for
the
petitioner
in
a
federal
employers'
liability
act
case
which
he
recovered
after
a
several
day
of
trial.
the
petitioner
was
a
railroad
employee,
was
given
a
so-called
"field
test".
he
was
or
suffered
personal
injuries,
received
a
jury
verdict
which
was
taken
away
from
him
by
the
florida
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
to
the
petitioner
seems
to
be
whether
or
not
the
manner,
method
and
motive
in
giving
an
alleged
field
test,
which
resulted
in
personal
injury
to
the
petitioner,
states
an
issue
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
or
as
a
grievance
under
the
railway
labor
act
which
what
--
is
what
the
florida
appellate
court
determined.
the
florida
appellate
court
held
and
i
quote,
"that
there
was
no
justiciable
issue
at
least
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
that
could
be
raised
as
to
the
propriety
or
the
right
of
the
railroad
to
give
a
test.
and
if
the
petitioner
will
agree,
he
had
a
remedy
for
such
grievance
under
the
railway
labor
act,
completely
ignoring
a
fact,
that
the
railway
labor
act
provides
no
remedy
for
personal
injury.
petitioner
contended
in
his
complaint
that
the
railroad
was
liable
in
the
following
respects,
in
negligently
and
unlawfully
requiring
the
plaintiff
to
participate
in
such
a
field
test
and
two,
in
negligently
allowing
the
servants,
agents
or
supervisors
to
conduct
such
a
test
which
resulted
in
a
personal
injury
to
the
railroad
employee.
the
florida
court
states
in
its
opinion
that
there
could
be
no
issue
under
such
allegation
and
made
some
statement
about
a
reasonable
safe
place
to
work
which
we
felt
had
no
application.
in
1956,
bert
smith,
flagman
on
the
florida
east
coast,
weighed
262
pounds.
this
was
lower
than
his
average
weight.
his
previous
weight
had
been
sometimes
in
the
300.
he
was
61
years
of
age.
he
was
five
foot
and
three.
he
was
and
is
a
legend
on
the
florida
east
coast
railroad.
he
is
a
man
who
knew
all
the
roads
and
had
never
received
a
demerit
in
30
years
--
37
years
of
service
as
a
bagger
and
a
flagman.
mr.
william
s.
frates
it's
his
colleague's
language,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
in
september
of
1956,
a
railroad
supervisor
asked
smith
to
retire.
he
was
on
the
train
and
get
ready
to
go
to
jacksonville.
mr.
smith
advised
him
that
he
had
two
or
three
more
years
of
good
service
and
he
refused
to
retire.
he
was
then
ordered
to
take
an
alleged
physical
fitness
test.
this
was
the
first
term
in
the
history
of
this
railroad
that
anybody
in
his
capacity
had
ever
been
requested
or
ordered
to
take
this
type
of
test.
the
railroad
had
been
in
existence
since
1896.
the
railroad
or
the
supervisors
of
the
railroad
admittedly
the
bias
of
test
that
it
knew
smith,
in
his
physical
condition,
could
not
pass.
it
was
a
walking
a
mile
down
the
tracks
on
a
hot
humid
florida
day.
there
had
been
very
little
change
in
smith's
physical
conditions
for
a
period
of
several
years.
short
time
before
this
incident
occurred,
he
had
been
to
the
flagler
hospital
in
st.
augustine,
had
been
certified
as
being
fit
for
his
duties
as
flagman.
he
and
his
representatives
went
to
the
--
my
opposed
for
this
test
was
sent
out
and
they
protested
in
right
time
at
that
time.
one
of
their
protestations
was
that
this
test
had
never
been
given
before
that
heretofore
the
chief
surgeon
of
the
medical
department
had
always
been
a
person
to
arbitrate
a
man's
physical
fitness.
mr.
smith
started
the
test,
walking
down
the
tracks.
he
was
accompanied
by
four
other
men.
it
was
obviously
he
couldn't
pass
this
particular
test.
he
failed
three
times.
as
a
result
of
the
fall,
he
became
totally
and
permanently
disabled
to
work
on
the
railroad
and
his
ability
to
walk
was
greatly
impaired.
he'd
had
arthritis
from
1942.
and
as
a
result
of
this
fall,
his
arthritic
condition
in
his
knees
was
aggravated
and
there
was
no
dispute
that
he
was
permanently
and
totally
disabled.
evidence
was
induced
at
the
trial
with
secured,
jury
could
and
indeed
fully
that
the
so-called
test
that
this
railroad
and
device
had
no
relation
to
smith's
duties
as
a
flagman.
and
i'll
wish
to
go
into
the
evidence
at
this
time
because
the
jury
decided
in
that
particular
issue
but
this
particular
area
which
he
worked
had
a
block
system.
the
medical
department
had
always
--
before
this
been
an
arbitrator
of
this
issue.
the
medical
department
just
a
few
days
before
this
had
certified
this
man
has
able
to
handle
this
particular
job.
he
had
performed
--
he
had
been
performing
his
duties
on
supervision
for
years
in
the
present
physical
condition
and
he
had
never
been
reprimanded
or
received
any
demerits.
we
also
contended
at
the
trial
and
currently,
the
jury
believed
us
that
this
was
a
test
devised
solely
to
get
rid
of
bert
smith.
this
was
only
time
in
the
history
of
the
railroad
and
it
was
not
in
conflict
to
any
courts
with
any
of
the
rules
of
the
railroad.
the
florida
court
in
its
original
position
or
opinion
precluded
us
from
raising
the
issues
and
it
confined
it
solely
to,
did
they
give
him
a
reasonable
safe
place
to
conduct
this
test.
that
just
nullified
the
whole
action
as
we
saw
it
because
they
precluded
us
from
establishing
the
manner
in
which
the
test
was
given,
the
method,
the
motive
whether
or
not
the
test
had
any
relation
to
his
duties
which
the
jury
believe
that
he
didn't.
in
fact,
there's
a
medical
department
heretofore
and
certified
his
fitness.
in
fact,
that
the
medical
department
under
testimony
of
a
chief
surgeon
will
we
brought
at
the
trial
that
he
had
testified
that
bert
smith
was
qualified
to
perform
the
duties
of
a
flagman,
that
this
was
also
pointed
out
to
these
men
in
their
original
letter
that
they
protested
too
when
they
started
the
test.
the
fact
that
bert
smith's
physical
condition
prevented
him
from
performing
this
test,
this
was
something
--
this
was
a
test
that
it
was
obvious
to
anybody
that
bert
smith
would
never
pass
this
test.
he
fell
and
of
course
a
part
from
the
arthritis
became
seriously
injured
and
was
rushed
to
a
hospital.
mr.
william
s.
frates
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
a
roadbed
on
the
main
line
of
the
florida
east
coast
railroad.
there
are
some
evidence
that
it
was
a
very
rough
terrain
and
evidence
characterizing
it
as
being
the
worst
possible
place
on
the
railroad
for
this
test
to
be
given.
mr.
william
s.
frates
no,
sir.
we
feel,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
this
was
all
part
of
the
negligent
manner
and
method,
the
place.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did
say
that
the
reasonable
safe
place
in
which
to
work
was
the
issue.
we
contend
that
that
particular
item
was
out
of
the
case
but
the
terrain
of
place
they
stay
fit
for
him
to
perform
his
task
went
to
the
motive,
went
to
the
manner.
i
think
we
could
have
gone
back
and
possibly
tried
this
case
under
--
whether
too
many
rocks
there.
but
that
was
not
the
issue
in
this
case
and
we
felt
not
the
major
issue
in
this
particular
case.
the
petitioner
has
never
contended
but
the
railroad
couldn't
give
proper
and
reasonable
test.
we
admitted
that
an
induced
evidence
at
the
trial
that
the
supervisors
could
relieve
men
at
a
time
when
he
was
unable
to
perform
his
duties.
we
stated
at
the
trial
and
in
our
appellate
procedure
and
showed
that
the
supervisor
had
the
authority
that
any
time
they
felt
that
a
man
could
not
perform
his
duties,
all
they
have
to
do
was
take
him
off
the
train
and
then
have
him
certified
either
as
being
qualified
or
not
qualified
by
the
medical
department.
but
that
this
attempt
to
pick
out
a
test
that
they
knew
he
could
not
pass
under
conditions
that
he
knew
he
could
not
pass,
circumventing
completely
the
medical
department,
was
solely
an
attempt
to
get
rid
of
him.
we
admitted
that
the
railroad
should
be
concerned
with
safety
but
they
not
use
--
should
not
use
safety
as
a
guidance
to
preclude
a
man
from
performing
the
job
in
the
same
manner
that
he
performed
it
for
years.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
the
trial
judge,
when
we
went
back
the
second
time,
stated
that
you
could
not
contest
--
we
could
not
contest
the
propriety
or
the
right
of
the
railroad
to
give
this
test.
when
we
went
back
on
a
pretrial
and
the
second
time
when
we
proferred
the
evidence,
the
trial
judge
rule
that
we
couldn't
go
into
anything
about
the
manner
how
the
test
was
given,
the
medical
department,
his
physical
condition,
all
of
those
things
that
we
felt
that
were
material
and
relevant
to
the
issues,
the
florida
appellate
court
by
its
opinion
and
particularly
by
the
word
propriety
precluded
us
from
going
into.
they
said
that
propriety
and
right
to
give
the
test,
the
webster's
new
international
dictionary,
the
second
edition,
defiance
propriety
as
being
proper
or
fit
in,
the
appropriateness
or
the
correctness.
we
contend,
and
of
course
we
say
it
was
a
jury
issue,
that
this
was
an
improper
test,
it
was
a
nonreasonable
test.
it
had
no
correctness
and
it
had
no
appropriateness
in
relation
to
his
duty.
mr.
william
s.
frates
they
said
there
could
not
be
negligence.
i
said
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
they
said
there
was
not
a
justiciable
issue,
your
honor,
and
that
if
he
had
a
grievance,
then
obviously
his
grievance
was
his
injury.
if
he
had
a
--
a
grievance,
he
should
then
go
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
said
there
was
no
justiciable
issue
at
least
under
the
fela
but
that's
where
we
say
they're
so
wrong.
mr.
william
s.
frates
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
in
our
opinion
--
in
our
opinion,
they
precluded
the
fact
that
this
test
could
be
negligently
given.
hence,
they
said
that
propriety
or
the
right
of
this
test
was
a
grievance
which
should
be
submitted
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
and
of
course
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
no,
sir.
your
honors,
this
man
had
already
been
--
been
injured.
this
was
a
personal
injury
that
he
had
sustained.
there
was
no
remedy.
there
was
no
right
or
regrets
that
this
man
did
have
gotten,
if
he
had
gone
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board,
what
would
his
recourse
have
been?
nothing.
they
might
have
ruled
at
that
time
that
the
test
was
not
a
proper
test,
was
not
a
reasonable
test
as
they
put
in
their
reports
as
shown
by
the
respondent's
brief,
but
there
is
no
authority.
now,
we
have
cited
cases
in
our
brief
where
the
unreasonableness
of
a
test
for
requiring
a
person
to
go
to
additional
stress
and
strain,
knowing
that
condition,
are
negligent
acts
and
can
be
compensated.
the
trial
judge,
mr.
justice
harlan,
when
we
went
back
to
determine
what
we
could
prove
in
this
case,
said,
"the
only
thing
that
you
can
possibly
show
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
he
had
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work."
nothing
else,
nothing
about
the
medical
department,
nothing
about
his
physical
condition,
nothing
about
the
motive
of
these
particular
cases,
and
we
say
these
were
all
acts,
wrongful
acts
that
this
was
an
abuse
of
a
right
to
give
a
man
test,
and
when
we
abuse
a
right,
then
there
is
a
negligent
act
that
springs
from
that.
mr.
william
s.
frates
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
--
i
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
had
he
started
or
refused
to
take
the
test
even
though
he
protested.
and
they
discharged
him,
it
would
have
been
--
been
of
a
railway
labor
adjustment
board
act.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
in
our
opinion
--
in
our
opinion
he
could
that
--
he
didn't
have
to
take
the
chance,
sir.
we
feel
under
the
humanitarian
philosophy
of
refusing
to
take
the
test
and
being
fired
and
then
take
his
case
back
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
to
see
whether
he
was
reinstated.
they
told
him
to
take
the
test,
he
protested,
he
took
the
test,
he
was
then
injured
and
he
had
no
remedy
and
he
would
have
no
remedy
for
that
injury
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
--
unless
it
is
under
the
fela.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
it
was
submitted,
the
trial
judge.
this
very
issue
was
submitted
to
the
trial
judge
and
he
overruled
this
contention
because
he
said
again
that
you
can't
have
a
wrong
without
a
remedy.
you
can't
say
--
and
it's
a
jury
issue,
of
course
the
railroad
and
they
have
in
their
present
brief
attempted
to
argue
that
this
was
a
necessary
and
proper
test.
we
say
that
was
a
jury
question.
they
resolved
that
question
in
favor
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
william
s.
frates
sir,
i
have
never
understood
how
it
could
be
anything
when
a
personal
injury
was
involved
but
on
federal
employers'
liability
act
does
for
itself.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
the
reason
i
said
that,
sir,
if
--
is
because
they
said
this
was
an
issue
if
he
was
agreed
that
the
only
grievance
he
had
was
an
injury,
that
should
go
to
the
railroad
adjustment
board
and
that's
where
we
say
they're
so
wrong.
they
are
not
saying
that
--
that
he
--
that
it
was
or
was
not
negligence.
mr.
william
s.
frates
sir,
that's
exactly
what
they
said.
mr.
william
s.
frates
well,
they
said
if
you
interpret
it
and
frankly,
i
had
difficulty
with
this
paragraph
as
to
what
they
mean
but
they
said
they
reversed
the
jury
verdict
which
was
submitted
on
the
negligent
issue
and
said
this
in
effect
is
not
an
issue
of
negligence
to
go
to
the
jury
under
the
fela
test
because
there
isn't
any
issue
of
negligence
before
the
railroad
adjustment
board
as
i
understand.
mr.
william
s.
frates
they
took
his
verdict
away
on
the
basis
of
two
allegations
of
negligence
and
said
you
can
even
raise
that,
so
they
precluded
it
from
us
and
i
say,
yes
they
did
take
that
away
from
him.
i'm
sorry,
sir,
that
i
can't
clarify
but
i
have
been
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
--
i
am
having
difficulty
with
this
for
some
time.
mr.
william
s.
frates
that
was
--
those,
mr.
justice
black,
were
abandoned
on
the
second
proper
of
testimony
because
we
felt
as
i
stated
that
all
of
this
--
the
place
and
all
of
these
things
related
to
number
one
and
two,
we
had
a
clear
ruling
on
number
one
and
two.
we
were
anxious
to
get
this
case
to
this
court
because
we
felt
that
it
was
an
improper
decision
and
we
didn't
want
to
complicate
it
by
going
back
and
retrying
it
on
an
issue
that
we
thought
was
covered
by
one
and
two.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
one
and
two.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
we
have
it
the
whole
first
trial.
mr.
william
s.
frates
the
whole
at
first
trial
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
the
charges
there
were
--
were
the
--
the
complete
charges
and
the
respect
of
--
of
every
allegations.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
in
that
case,
as
they
came
back
and
said
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case
in
the
first
opinion
was
to
whether
or
not
the
railroad
had
furnished
him
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work.
mr.
william
s.
frates
sir,
i
--
i
don't
know
what
they
meant
by
that
opinion.
the
--
the
trial
judge,
well,
he
went
back
the
second
time
in
interpreting
the
opinion
and
his
comments
are
shown
on
page
345
and
346
thought
they
didn't
--
our
interpretation
was
that
they
did
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
presented
that
question
in
--
in
the
entire
--
the
entire
record
--
excuse
--
excuse
me,
sir.
the
entire
record
is
predicating
in
getting
--
the
entire
record,
the
first
and
the
second
trial
here
before
to
this
court.
i
might
add
that
what
happened
in
this
particular
case,
the
first
trial
went
to
the
appellate
court.
it
was
reversed.
we
then
took
the
record.
we
proffered
that
record
to
the
trial
judge
on
the
second
trial
and
said
we're
going
to
stand
on
these
two
issues
instead
of
going
two
or
three
or
four
day
trial
with
the
same
issues
with
proper.
he
accepted
the
proper,
but
ruled
at
that
time,
that
under
the
issues
or
under
the
opinion
of
this
court,
that
we
could
not
introduce
that
evidence.
and
the
only
thing
that
we
could
show
was
whether
or
not
they
had
picked
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
give
a
test
not
the
right
to
give
a
test,
but
the
prior
to
give
a
test,
the
manner
or
the
motive,
only
the
place.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
we
felt
that
it
did
and
the
--
the
record
actually
in
the
second
trial
is
exactly
the
same
as
the
first
trial
with
a
few
statements
eliminated
about
took
place.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
our
position
is
exactly,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
statement
in
the
railroad
brief
is
taking
completely
out
of
context.
the
reading
of
the
transcript
in
those
notes
show
that
we
were
concerned
about
these
two
items
and
that
was
not
the
disposition
of
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
sir,
that's
a
question
that
--
and
frankly,
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
--
to
give
you
a
satisfactory
answer
on
that
because
i
don't
understand
this
opinion
and
i
haven't
understood
this
opinion
or
--
or
what
it
means.
we
know
what
it
meant
when
they
reversed
the
case
and
we
know
what
it
meant
to
the
trial
judge
he
was
going
to
try
at
the
second
time
that
under
these
two
issues,
where
the
man
was
injured,
we
could
not
proceed
under
what
we
felt
was
the
real
heart
of
this
particular
lawsuit.
the
right
and
the
manner
which
they
gave
this
test
issue.
sorry,
i
cannot
answer
your
question.
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
you
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
well,
sir,
i
think
that,
first
the
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
no,
sir.
i
feel
that
this
court
would
have
the
authority
to
say
that
this
was
a
negligent
action
or
injury
that
came
within
title
51,
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
that
you
could
reinstate
the
rational
burden
of
the
court.
mr.
william
s.
frates
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
william
s.
frates
no,
sir,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
think
that
is
in
our
briefs.
of
course,
if
i
may
say
enclosing,
it
appears
to
us
that
we
come
down
to
a
basic
proposition
and
we
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
unless
this
final
judgment
is
set
aside
and
the
jury
verdict
reinstated
that
the
petitioner
will
has
sustained
an
injury
or
a
wrong
for
which
there
is
no
remedy.
we
don't
feel
that
our
system
of
jurisprudence
could
warrant
such
a
possession.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
mr.
william
s.
frates
may
it
please
the
court,
so
little
time
and
if
you'll
pardon
me,
i'll
talk
rapidly.
just
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
your
honor,
we
abandoned
six
allegations
because
the
court
and
i
would
like
to
read
that.
that
is
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
point
it
out,
held
that
those
allegations
and
the
railroad
counsel
agreed
and
i
agreed,
dealt
with
only
with
a
reasonable
safe
place
to
work.
the
other
two
dealt
with
the
giving
up
the
test.
the
court
held
under
the
opinion
that
i'm
reading
from
page
332
that
this
was
a
pretrial
part
of
the
proceedings.
that
on
retrial,
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
go
into
the
propriety
or
impropriety
of
giving
this
particular
test,
although
i
did
it,
the
original
trial
admit
evidence
on
that
fact
and
i
felt
that
it
was
a
question.
however,
i
have
been
reversed.
mr.
william
s.
frates
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
william
s.
frates
your
honor,
the
court
held
and
may
i
read
from
341,
"but
i
would
sure
entered
an
order
and
this
was
discussing
all
of
the
remaining
allegations
on
the
pretrial
before
they
were
abandoned
which
was
later
on."
and
here's
what
the
appellate
court
said
discussing
those
items
and
i
refer
to
page
--
page
340
and
341
in
a
discussion,
a
pretrial
discussion,
in
trying
to
determine
the
issues
in
this
case,
over
here
on
340,
"the
remaining
allegations
were
discussed."
then
the
court
said,
"but
i
would
sure
enter
my
order
that
i
would
sustain
an
objection
to
any
testimony
offered
or
proffered,
which
had
to
do
with
the
grievance
of
the
employed
as
the
propriety
of
the
right
of
being
given
this
particular
test
on
the
basis
of
this
opinion."
the
evidence
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
your
honors,
the
propriety
goes
to
the
actual
method
and
manner,
as
i
read
here
yesterday.
the
court
said
and
the
trial
court
said,
"i
refute
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
your
honor,
we
relied
--
we
relied
on
the
fact
that
this
court,
the
lower
court
and
the
appellate
court
said
that
all
of
the
evidence
relative
to
the
manner
and
method
of
this
case
--
test
was
not
admissible.
mr.
william
s.
frates
your
honor,
it
said
the
propriety
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
your
honor
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
thank
you,
justice
black.
that
was
the
question,
the
propriety
whether
or
not
this
was
a
proper
--
proper
test.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir,
as
far
as
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
no,
sir.
it
says
that
the
other
--
the
other
elements
in
the
record
show
that
the
court
said
that
those
are
reasonable
safe
place
to
work.
we
still
stand
on
the
fact
of
the
negligent
given
test,
which
was
a
jury
issue
and
the
court
said
that
all
the
evidence
in
relation
to
that
test,
sir,
was
inadmissible
and
that's
what
the
trial
court
held.
we
could
not
put
an
isle
of
evidence
about
this
test
in
--
before
under
any
of
this
counsel
and
--
mr.
william
s.
frates
--
they
ruled
that
in
the
first
case.
mr.
william
s.
frates
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
because
the
court
had
said
that
they
wouldn't
permit
any
evidence.
mr.
william
s.
frates
yes,
sir.
but
i
also
did
yield
to
one
and
two
which
said
that
the
issue
of
this
test
was
not
a
triable
issue
and
we
rely
on
that
and
didn't
yield
on
--
on
that
issue.
and
that
is
the
whole
basis
of
this
case.
there
has
never
been
any
contention
by
the
railroad
until
here
that
the
manner
and
the
method
of
giving
this
test,
their
whole
brief,
their
question
say,
"this
was
a
proper
test."
we
say
it
was
not
a
proper
test,
that
this
was
a
jury
issue
as
to
whether
an
improper,
an
unreasonable
test
became
a
--
a
jury
question
under
the
fela.
mr.
william
s.
frates
that's
one
theory.
we
also
say
that
there
is
an
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
this
test
was
a
reasonable
test
under
the
circumstances.
and
that
was
the
jury,
whether
it
was
a
proper
test,
whether
it
had
any
relations
to
--
to
his
duty,
whether
that
this
was
a
test
designed
to
get
rid
of
him.
all
of
which
evidence
was
adduced
at
the
trial
in
which
the
jury
believed.
and
the
jury
believed
that
there
was
no
requirement
to
go
back
a
miles.
that
was
an
issue.
mr.
william
s.
frates
no,
sir.
the
only
assignment
that
has
been
abandoned,
the
only
thing
that
we
could've
shown
is
shown
in
the
record
by
the
court,
was
to
show
that
the
erring
where
this
man
walks
was
a
reasonably
safe
place
under
the
circumstances.
that's
the
only
fact
that
we
could
have
proven
as
shown
in
the
pretrial
evidence
and
the
rulings
of
the
court.
that
was
the
only
evidence
we
could
and
that
wasn't
the
major
issue
in
the
case.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
