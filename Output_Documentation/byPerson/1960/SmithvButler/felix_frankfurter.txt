you
have
both.[laughter]
justice
felix

mr.
wahl.
justice
felix
frankfurter
justice
whittaker
asked
you
whether
you
could
read
allegations
(a)
and
(b)
under
paragraph
(5)
as
alleging
negligence
in
regard
to
the
manner
in
which
the
test
was
pursued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
heard
you
that's
why
i'm
asking
the
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
about
to
ask.
you
said
you
couldn't
read
it
that
way.
that
isn't
the
question
whether
you
could.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
that
is
in
--
in
point
either
mr.
wahl.
the
question
is
whether
your
court
of
appeals
read
it
that
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
should
have
read
it
that
way
or
could've
read
it
that
way
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
repeat
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
be
the
question
is
whether
what
your
court
of
appeals
did,
not
what
you
think
it
could've
done
or
shouldn't
have
done
or
wasn't
allowed
to
do.
either
in
fact,
it
construed
(a)
or
(b)
as
going
to
the
negligent
manner
of
conducting
the
test
or
to
that
court,
not
of
any
us
including
you,
whether
that
court
construed
it
in
the
first
place,
as
not
going
to
the
manner
of
the
test,
but
to
giving
any
test.
and
secondly,
whether
that
was
an
allowable
construction
by
that
court,
the
state
court
of
the
federal
act,
those
seem
to
me
to
be
the
crucial
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
by
saying
it,
that
court
could
not,
you
mean,
that
no
construction
placed
by
this
court
under
their
proper
standing
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
could
so
construe
that
allegation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
do
if
i
may
so
because
a
state
court
cannot
give
an
allegation
in
a
federal
employers'
liability
complaint,
such
a
construction
as
to
be
unreasonable
or
unfair
and
thereby,
frustrate
the
act,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
what
the
--
the
construction
by
a
state
court
of
a
complaint
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
is
not
conclusive
upon
this
court,
if
by
such
construction
whether
willful
or
not
and
i'm
not
suggesting
willfulness,
if
it
gives
a
strain
construction
to
an
allegation
on
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
by
that
process,
it
can't
repeat
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
another
way
of
saying
that
your
court
of
appeals
number
one,
construed
one
and
two
merely
to
charge
a
cause
of
action
because
of
submitting,
compelling
the
man
to
be
submitted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
a
test.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
two,
that
as
a
perfectly
allowable,
indeed
you
say
a
required
construction
with
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
allegations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
make
--
may
i
break
in
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
make
of
the
statement
of
counsel
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
make
of
the
statement
by
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
at
the
first
trial
on
page
277?
"now,
gentlemen,
there
was
never
--
there
was
never
any
other
test
given
to
anybody
on
this
railroad
like
the
one
they
gave
bert
smith."
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
your
comment
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
the
same
kind
of
walking
test
for
a
mile?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
almost
exclusively
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
kind
of
testing
had
you
given
to
other
people?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
just
--
would
you
mind
just
answering
one
question,
which
i
think
this
case
a
little
being
answered
very
explicitly.
mr.
wahl
said
that
at
the
second
trial,
you
abandoned
then
--
the
last
six
allegations.
is
that
true
or
not
true
according
to
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
you
were
in
the
compulsion,
in
the
first
place,
your
answer
that
you
did
abandon
--
that
those
six
allegations
from
(c)
through
(a)
--
or
not
before
the
court
in
the
second
trial,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
secondly,
those
allegations
from
(c)
to
(h)
do
not
merely
deal
with
the
safe
place,
(g)
--
certainly
(g)
was
very
different
things
and
merely
a
safe
place.
in
other
words,
(c)
to
(h)
cannot
repetitive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
propriety
of
giving
a
test
is
a
very
different
thing
from
the
safe
conditions
under
which
a
test
is
given.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
ought
to
be
--
then
you
ought
to
have
gone,
if
i
may
say
so,
to
your
supreme
court
and
to
this
court
because
the
court
improperly
shut
you
off
from
making
a
case
which
you
alleged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
did
it
say
the
manner
and
method?
where
did
it
say
the
method?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
propriety
means
that
isn't
proper,
not
that
the
conditions,
under
which
it
was
done,
were
not
proper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
very
different
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
that
everything
that
you
alleged
from
(c)
to
(h),
he
said
he
wouldn't
let
you
make
proof
of,
but
you
could
make
proof
of
under
(a)
and
(b).
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
phrase,
that
you
could
make
proof
of
that
what
you
sought
to
prove
from
(c)
through
(h)
by
proving
it
under
(a)
and
(b)?
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
make
any
of
objections
to
a
ruling
which
you
--
i
understand
you
to
say
was
made,
that
you
couldn't
prove
the
allegation
from
(c)
through
(h)?
did
you
object
to
that
ruling
that
the
court
wouldn't
let
you
make
proof
from
(c)
through
(h)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
can
object
when
the
court
denies
you
something
and
you
think
the
denial
is
wrong,
the
normal
rudimental
thing
is
to
object
to
a
wrong
ruling
not
to
yield
to
it.
