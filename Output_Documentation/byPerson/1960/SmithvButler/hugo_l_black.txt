suppose
they

suppose
they
discharge
him
on
this
account,
then
that
would

that
would've
gone
up
to
the
--
justice

board,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
what
--
what
--
then
what
you're
claiming
is
that
they
put
him
to
work
and
put
him
out
to
work
that
he
had
to
obey
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
then
he
was
injured.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
suppose
they
had
ordered
him,
that
had
been
a
part
of
his
work
that
in
this
condition,
he
should
run
a
mile
and
a
half.
could
he
have
sued
on
the
fela
on
that?
justice

--
justice

l.
black
did
the
court
charge
anything
about
refusing
the
verdict
on
the
count
of
contributory
negligence
in
his
taking
the
test?
justice

black
was
that
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
it
was
--
suppose
it's
necessary
and
proper
that
they
give
him
a
test,
what
is
the
contention
is
to
why
he's
injured
in
taking
the
test
that
wouldn't
be
under
the
fela?
justice

black
what
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
done
with
discharge
of
negligence
furnishing
a
dangerous
and
unsafe
location
to
conduct
the
field
test?
what
was
done
with
that?
justice

black
does
one
and
two
all
you
had
on
the
last
the
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
anything
here
as
to
the
first
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
the
whole
first
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
your
charges
there
and
what
was
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
to
furnishing
the
dangerous
and
unsafe
location
to
conduct
the
field
test.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
they
hold
about
that
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
they
mean
the
--
the
test
was
a
part
of
his
work?
did
they
treat
it
as
a
part
of
his
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
consider
that
the
--
if
you
have
presented
to
us
the
error
that
you
claimed
there
was
error
and
what
the
court
did
the
first
time.
justice

l.
black
first
--
first
reversal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
have
you
presented
this
question?
where
have
you
presented
that
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
your
--
your
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
florida
appellate
court
error
that
posing
railroad
employers
sustained
personal
injury
about
performing
an
alleged
physical
fitness
test,
whether
this
provision
of
the
railway
labor
act
precluded
him
from
claiming
that
the
giving
of
such
a
test
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case
was
an
act
of
negligence.
is
that's
your
question
you
presented?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
present
that
on
--
do
you
think
that
brings
up
person
adequately
or
the
trial
the
first
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
as
quite
a
different
trial
where
you
are
presenting
to
us
merely,
the
charge
of
negligence.
now,
it's
not
the
charge
of
negligence
but
calling
it
a
charge
of
negligence
if
whether
they
had
a
right
to
make
him
undergo
to
this
test.
that's
one
thing.
another
question,
which
seems
to
be
included
in
the
one
you
presented
is
whether
if
the
negligently
and
required
him
to
take
that
test
in
a
negligent
manner.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
covered
by
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
have
you
decided
the
case
we
had
determined
years
ago
that
justice
rutledge
wrote,
verdict
was
set
aside
in
missouri
and
then
it
was
tried
again,
brought
up.
and
we
actuate
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
erred
in
the
first
verdict,
judgment
was
set
aside
in
the
first
case?
have
you
cited
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
court
rendered
judgment,
did
it
not,
on
the
basis
of
a
performer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
--
i
understand
that
condition.
i'd
like
to
get
to
--
tomorrow
morning
if
you'll
talked
on
that.
if
the
court
said
in
its
opinion,
the
trial
court
entered
judgment
under
the
authority
of
our
prior
opinion
in
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
with
result
is
now,
as
i
understand
it,
under
this
judgment,
the
judgment
against
them
is
affirmed
and
your
argument
is
that
that
ends
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
what
i
would
like
to
know
tomorrow,
if
you
will,
why
didn't
the
court
correct
to
enter
order
judgment
under
the
authority
of
the
five
decisions
of
the
case?
that
question
is
not
here
in
connection
with
whether
he
could
not
have
appealed
in
the
first
time
because
it
was
not
a
final
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
--
the
first
judgment
was
reversed
--
was
reversed
and
remanded,
was
it
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
the
--
on
the
ground
of
errors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
not
held
appealable
afterwards.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
plaintiff
was
compelled
to
go
back
and
they
entered
a
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
first
judgment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
we
not
have
gave
before
us
the
question
as
to
whether
the
first
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
i
--
i
think
i
understand
your
point.
i
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it's
a
pretty
strong
point.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
new
evidence
offered
at
the
second
trial
of
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
submitted
on
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
old
evidence.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
all
i
ask
--
all
i
ask
was,
if
all
this
evidence
that
you
have
in
here,
evidence
that
you
give
on
the
first
trial
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
reversed
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
said
the
propriety
of
this
particular
test.
