mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
trouble
with
my
good
friend
bill
frates
is
that
he
had
a
perfectly
good
complaint
with
eight
allegations
of
negligence
and
six
of
them
covered
this
case.
he
elected,
however,
to
travel
on
the
first
two
which
then
alleged
negligence
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
called
his
attention
to
that.
they
send
him
back
and
said,
"try
your
case
under
your
allegations
of
negligence.
you
haven't
alleged
any
negligence
under
your
first
two
counts."
he
goes
back
on
the
retrial.
and
on
the
retrial,
he
gets
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
says,
"i'm
going
to
stick
to
my
guns.
i
abandoned
all
these
allegations
if
the
court
says
constitute
allegations
of
negligence.
and
i'm
going
to
be
stubborn.
i'm
going
to
be
like
an
ostrich
to
stick
my
head
in
the
sand,
and
i'm
going
to
continue
to
insist
on
the
two
that
are
not
even
good
and
with
that
happened
to
it."
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
alright.
you
misread
them,
mr.
justice.
you'll
see
at
the
record
on
page
1,
he
starts
out
by
saying
that
in
1956,
when
he
was
employed
as
a
trainman
on
the
main
line
of
the
florida
east
coast,
he
was
directed
to
have
a
field
test.
now,
there's
certainly
enough
to
negligence
by
fit,
so
far,
particularly
says
he
concedes
that
he
is
entitled
to
be
given
a
reasonable
field
test.
then
what's
his
first
allegation?
that
on
such
and
such
a
date,
the
defendant
was
negligent
(a)
in
negligently
and
unlawfully
requiring
the
plaintiff
to
participate
in
such
a
field
test.
well,
there's
nothing
wrong
there.
he
doesn't
say
in
an
improper
field
test,
in
a
negligent
field
test,
in
a
wrongful
field
test.
he
just
says
the
field
test.
and
he
himself
has
conceded
that
a
reasonable
and
proper
field
test
is
alright.
so,
that
--
that's
the
reason
they
threw
that
one
out
because
he
didn't
allege
any
negligence
under
(a).
i
repeat
again.
if
he
had
said
that
we
gave
him
an
improper
field
test,
a
negligent
field
test
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
in
such
--
well,
he's
got
to
say
that
we
--
some
allegation,
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
test
because
he
himself
concede
that
we've
got
the
right
to
give
him
a
test.
so
his
allegation
is
he's
got
to
say
something.
he
does
say
further
on
that.
this
isn't
inadvertent
pleading,
getting
further
down
that
he
does
say
what
he
needs.
then
in
number
b,
he
says
in
negligently
allowing
his
servants,
agents
or
supervisors
to
conduct
such
a
field
test.
now,
he
doesn't
say
that
they
negligently
conducted
the
field
test.
he
doesn't
say
they
conducted
an
improper
test.
he
just
says
that
it
was
wrong
to
conduct
the
test.
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
says
that
since
the
only
way
you
can
sue
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
at
least
that's
the
way
we
understand
it,
is
to
allege
negligence
that
there
was
no
justiciable
negligence
allowing
those
two
counts.
the
court
said
that
mr.
frates
misled
the
jury
by
prejudicial
argument
and
got
them
off
from
side
issues,
and
they
reversed
the
case.
it
should
go
back
and
be
tried
on
grounds
(c)
through
(h)
which
specifically
alleged
negligence.
now,
gentlemen,
this
is
right
in
court
matter
to
us.
and
i
hope
you
don't
get
up
on
the
side
tracking.
he's
got
six
perfectly
good
driving
of
negligence.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
can't
help
but
he
had
a
chance
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he
--
he
stuck
his
head
to
his
heels
in
the
ground
and
to
allege
judge,
i'm
going
to
stick,
and
i'm
not
going
to
try
on
this
other
ground
which
the
judge
said
he
had
a
perfect
right
to
do.
trial
judge
made
it
very
clear
that
he
had
a
right
to
go
to
the
jury
on
this
up.
now,
let's
freeze
this
up.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
would
think
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
do
not
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
not
in
my
judgement.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
not
in
my
judgement.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
i
didn't
try
the
case,
but
i
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
can't
answer
that.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
cannot
answer
that.
i
cannot
answer.
all
i
can
say
is
that
our
position
is,
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
agreed
with
us,
that
those
allegations
don't
constitute
allegations
of
negligence.
now,
getting
down
to
(c)
through
(h),
and
you'll
see
that
he's
adequately
covering
himself.
my
friend
mr.
frates
is
a
good
pleader.
look
what
he
says
in
the
next.
in
negligently
furnished
in
the
plaintiff
a
dangerous
and
unsafe
location
at
upon
which
to
engage
in
such
a
field
test.
there,
he
gets
in
all
about
this
horrible
place
in
the
right
of
way
which
is
then
is
on
our
main
line,
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
quite
that
bad."
(d)
in
negligently
furnishing,
he
made
dangerous
and
unsafe
place
at
upon
which
to
work,
(e)
in
failing
to
use
ordinary
care
and
providing
the
plaintiff
a
reason
and
a
safe
place
to
work,
(f)
in
failing
to
provide
him
with
a
reason
to
be
safe."
now,
listen
to
(g),
and
(g)
gets
down
to
the
manner
in
which
the
test
was
conducted,
"in
negligently
failing
to
provide
the
plaintiff
with
proper
equipment
and
safeguard."
and
that's
why
he's
kicking
about.
he
says
he
didn't
give
him
a
test
in
the
proper
fashion.
there,
is
his
allege."
in
negligently
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
and
in
failing
to
provide
adequate
supervision
and
instruction
governing
authority.
so
all
that
happened
to
him
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he
certainly
did.
he
says
you
--
you
prove
anything
you
want
to
under
(c),
(d),
(e),
(f),
(g),
(r),
(h),
plus
another
one
he
brought.
at
the
second
trial,
he
drawn
up
an
allegation
that
we
were
negligent
in
giving
them
field
test
knowing
the
plaintiff's
bad
physical
condition.
and
he
abandoned
that
one
on
the
field.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he
--
he
abandoned
that
so
i
doubt
the
case.
(inaudible)
on
the
field
that
he
abandoned
that
one
because
he
wanted
to
stick
to
the
first
two
but
there's
no
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
certainly,
it
did.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
they
said
that
--
it
didn't
say
this.
the
real
issue,
well,
of
course,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
that
--
they
said
that's
the
real
issue,
but
they
still
left
opened
to
him
everything
except
one
and
two.
mr.
frates
had
never
had
any
misapprehension,
neither
is
anyone
else.
the
only
thing
that
was
(inaudible)
was
(a)
and
(b).
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he
had
(c)
down
to
(h).
and
he
just
said
he
was
not
(inaudible).
now
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
court
said
that
sends
you
to
crime
to
travel
under
(c)
through
(h)
and
since
you
insist
on
trying
to
travel
on
two
issues
which
the
appellate
court
has
said,
"don't
allege
negligence
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act."
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
correct
judgment,
yes.
but
the
judge
made
a
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
correct.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
i
don't
get
your
question.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
i'm
in
candor
and
compel
to
say
you
do
have
it
before
you.
i
know
you're
trying
to
keep
myself
for
anybody
else.
you
do
have
it
for
you.
but
what
the
florida
court
held
is
what
so
obvious
from
the
plain
reading
of
the
english
language
that
my
friend
mr.
frates
brought
up
an
excellent
complaint
with
six
excellent
allegations
of
negligence
but
unfortunately,
he
had
two
that
didn't
allege
in
--
in
their
field.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
i
--
coming
to
you,
mr.
justice
black,
i
[laughter]
might
happy
to
hear.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
hope
that
will
--
i
get
the
opinion
that
i'm
still
going
to
be.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
the
court.
in
response
to
some
questions
which
were
raised
yesterday
afternoon,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
if
the
clause
of
the
plaintiff's
case
in
the
trial
of
the
court
below,
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
was
made
on
the
ground
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
first
trial.
the
second
trial,
of
course,
was
merely
a
profit.
a
--
there
are
number
of
motions
were
made,
but
included
in
them
were
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
on
the
ground
that
no
actionable
negligence
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
had
been
proved.
there
was
another
motion
to
strike
all
testimony
as
to
the
right
to
give
the
test
to
smith.
there
was
a
third
motion
to
strike
those
allegations
from
the
complaint,
which
dealt
with
the
right
to
give
smith
the
test.
so
you
can
see
that
all
the
fundamental
issues
in
the
case
were
properly
raised
by
motion.
at
the
close
of
plaintiff's
case,
the
judge
took
those
motions
under
advisement.
the
motions
were
renewed
at
the
end
of
all
of
the
testimony,
and
then
they
were
brought
up
again
after
the
verdict
in
the
form
of
a
motion
for
judgment,
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
they
were
brought
up
for
the
fourth
time
in
a
motion
for
new
trial.
so
certainly,
if
the
trial
judge
had
ample
opportunity
to
do
what
we
think
he
should
have
done.
and
when
this
got
to
the
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
pointed
out
that
the
trial
court
had
had
ample
opportunity
to
consider
all
these
questions
and
they
reversed
it.
and
remanded
the
case
for
a
new
trial
for
doing
what
they
said
he
should
have
done,
which
was
to
give
a
new
trial
limited
to
the
last
six
allegations
of
negligence
in
the
complaint.
i
hope
i
pointed
out
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
was
--
that
they
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
they
didn't
allege
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
the
--
the
--
it
was
our
district
court
of
appeal
and
the
certiorari
was
denied
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
by
our
supreme
court.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
court
held
that
allegations
a
and
b
of
the
complaint
did
not
allege
actionable
negligence
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
i
think
that's
probably
has
something
to
do
with
it
because
if
you
look
further
on
down,
you'll
find
in
allegations
c
through
h.
there
is
alleged,
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
given
a
place
--
safe
place
to
work.
there's
alleged
that
the
test
wasn't
conducted
properly,
wasn't
properly
supervised
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
they
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
mere
right
to
give
a
test
was
not
negligence
or
the
deprivation
of
that
right
was
not
negligence
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
because
everybody
has
conceded,
including
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
that
this
board,
that
the
railroad
had
the
right
to
give
a
reasonable
test.
and
the
complaint
didn't
say
that
the
test
was
not
reasonable.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
there
are
six
allegations
of
the
complaint,
which
clearly
give
him
the
cause
of
action
for
the
thing
he
wants.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
and
i
don't
think
it's
up
to
this
court
or
us,
to
try
to
read
in
to
some
mirky
language
in
sections
a
and
b
of
the
complaint
or
in
the
opinion
and
try
to
figure
out
that
it
means
something
else.
all
this
court
is
concerned
with
is
whether
the
right
result
was
reached.
and
the
right
result
was
reached
because
he
was
remanded
for
a
trial
on
those
issues
which
alleged
negligence
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
where
he
was
entitled
to
a
trial.
and
he
was
only
deprived
to
the
trial
on
those
issues
which
did
not
constitute
negligence
under
the
federal
act.
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
that's
about
all
i
can
say
about
it
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
on
that
particular
aspect.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
am
afraid
it
is,
but
after
all
when
you
win
a
case
and
you
win
it
on
the
right
basis,
if
the
court
uses
some
dicta
or
some
mirky
language,
you
don't
go
back
and
say,
"judge,
let's
change
this
around
a
little,
because
he
may
change
it
and
end
up
ruling
for
(inaudible)."
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
now,
let
me
impress
upon
the
court
if
i
may.
the
factual
context
in
which
the
appellate
court
held
that
this
motion
for
--
that
this
motion
should've
been
granted
and
that
there
wasn't
a
cause
of
action
stated
as
to
the
right
to
give
the
test.
in
the
first
place,
these
are
the
undisputed
facts.
now,
these
are
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case
and
this
is
what
the
appellate
court
was
dealing
with.
we
had
mystified
by
fire
smith,
the
trainman,
who
had
reduced
from
327
to
slightly
under
300
pounds,
but
he
was
still
a
pretty
hefty
customer.
he
was
in
his
early
60s
and
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
witnesses,
his
condition
was
such
that
he
couldn't
even
step
up
from
the
ground
and
get
on
the
lower
step
to
get
into
the
coach.
he
had
to
get
a
stool
or
something
and
stand
on
that
and
then
get
into
the
coach.
now,
the
trainman's
chief
job
as
everybody
admits,
is
to
protect
the
rail
of
the
train
in
case
of
emergency.
fortunately,
only
too
rarely,
do
we
have
a
rear-end
collision,
but
rear-end
collisions
or
terrible
vengeance.
and
when
there
is
some
breakdown
in
the
railroad
mechanism
and
the
rear
of
the
train
needs
protection,
that's
what
this
man
was
on
there
for,
to
go
back
on
sufficient
distance
to
flag
or
put
a
fusee
or
put
a
torpedo.
now,
imagine
having
a
man
of
those
dimensions
and
those
qualifications
charged
with
that
dreaded
responsibility
on
a
passenger
train,
loaded
with
people.
now,
there's
not
neither
is
there
any
question
that
it
takes
about
a
mile
for
passenger
train
to
stop
at
such
a
--
in
such
a
manner,
as
not
to
endanger
the
passengers.
there's
no
dispute
about
that
when
he's
making
the
maximum
speed
which
on
the
florida
east
coast,
is
79
miles
an
hour.
now,
we
can
stop
him
sooner
than
that.
we
stop
one
sooner
than
that
a
few
weeks
ago
to
avoid
hitting
a
truck
and
we
put
92
passengers
in
the
hospital.
now,
it's
to
provide
for
the
safety
of
the
passengers
that
the
train
has
to
be
stopped
in
a
reasonable
manner
and
that
takes
a
mile.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
now,
smith
himself
testified
that
on
prior
occasions,
he
had
gone
back
a
mile
or
more
to
protect
the
train
under
circumstances
where
it
was
his
duty
to
go
back
and
protect.
on
top
of
that,
his
counsel,
my
good
friend,
bill
frates
adverted
to
that
fact
in
his
argument
before
the
jury.
and
on
top
of
that,
the
appellate
court
opinion,
whatever
else
it
may
have
wrong
with
it,
is
might
good
on
this
point,
it
also
calls
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
had
to
go
back
a
mile.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
with
the
man
on
the
train
almost
entirely
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
of
the
railroad
in
the
event
of
a
mechanical
failure
or
something
happening
which
required
the
train
to
be
protected.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
what
would
be
a
reasonable
test
as
to
whether
the
man
was
able
to
perform
his
duties?
can
you
think
of
any
of
the
test
on
earth
other
than
seeing
if
he
could
walk
him
off
and
that
is
the
terrible,
unrighteous,
awful
test
that
they
are
complaining
about
here.
we
simply
told
mr.
smith
that
because
of
your
physical
condition,
he
doesn't
look
to
us
like
you're
able
to
perform
your
duties.
and
smith
said,
"well,
i've
just
been
up
the
hospital.
the
doctor
says
i'm
in
good
shape."
so
we
said,
"well,
we
still
think
that
you
order
retirement."
he
says,
"no,
i
won't
keep
on."
so
we
said,
"alright,
then
you
take
a
test."
smith
said,
"he
wasn't
going
to
retire,
he
was
going
to
take
that
test."
so,
we
put
him
out
on
a
mile
of
the
railroad
in
dave
county,
the
same
county
where
miami
is,
we
didn't
take
him
off
to
the
jungle
somewhere,
as
people
of
entity.
we
had
to
get
him
off
where
there
weren't
any
crossings
or
anything
like
that,
whether
there's
straight
mile
of
track.
and
who
was
started
out
on
the
test?
five
people,
two
people
from
the
railroad,
smith
and
he
didn't
bring
one
union
chairman
with
him.
he
brought
two,
so
five
of
them
started
out.
the
two
railroad
people
walked
long
and
unleashing
pace,
they
made
the
mile
in
19
minutes.
the
two
union
chairmen,
tried
to
be
as
good
they
could
to
their
fat
friend
and
slowed
it
down
as
much
as
possible,
but
they
made
the
mile
in
23
minutes.
what
happened
to
--
just
to
file
the
fact,
he
never
did
make
it
[laughter].
it
took
him
32
minutes
to
make
3000
feet
and
he
couldn't
go
any
further,
as
one
of
his
own
human
chairman
testified,
he
failed
with
utter
exhaustion.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
3000
feet,
in
32
minutes.
now,
suppose
you
were
a
passenger
on
that
train
with
your
wife
and
your
children
and
there
were
some
mechanical
failure,
where
about
that
trainman
had
to
go
back
and
protect
you
from
another
approaching
train,
how
would
you
like
your
lives
to
be
in
the
hands
of
a
man
who
couldn't
even
walk
a
mile?
and
you
could
only
make
3000
feet
in
32
minutes
and
it
was
in
such
shape
at
the
end
of
that
time,
that
he
had
to
be
taken
to
the
hospital.
is
that
an
unreasonable
test,
gentlemen
of
the
court?
you
can
see
why.
my
friend,
mr.
frates,
wanted
to
try
the
case
on
the
basis
of
bias
and
prejudice
as
the
appellate
court
said
he
did,
rather
than
get
down
to
the
merits
of
this
case
and
you
can
see
why
it
was
reversed.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right,
your
last
comment
is
the
right
one.
there's
no
torturous
reading
of
that
language
can
--
that
can
make
a
and
b
say
that
there
was
a
test
given
in
a
negligent
manner.
he
doesn't
say
that.
he
doesn't
say
we
gave
an
improper
test.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he's
--
does
later
on.
and
the
court
said
that
as
to
those
later
ones
and
i
call
your
petition
particularly
the
(c),
(g)
and
(h),
he
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
but
he
said,
he
didn't
want
a
right
to
a
jury
the
trial.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
he
said
when
it
came
back
the
second
time
and
this
--
the
appellate
court
had
said,
"you
go
back
and
try
it
as
to
your
allegation
(c)
through
(h)."
his
attorney,
mr.
frates,
told
the
court,
"we
don't
want
the
trial
on
those
issues.
we're
going
to
stand
on
our
right
on
(c),
on
(a)
and
(b)
and
we
abandoned
all
the
remaining
six
allegations."
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
there's
no
dispute
about
it.
i
can
dig
it
out
for
you,
but
mr.
frates
will
freely
concede
that
he
abandoned
the
last
six
allegations
and
remain
--
rested
on
the
first
two.
there
isn't
just
no
dispute
about
that
if
you
want
me
to
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
judge,
you
see,
the
--
the
court
that
took
all
the
testimony
was
the
court
the
first
time
that
gotten
reversed.
they
did
all
that
before
they
were
reversed.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
all
i
can
say
is
you
instead
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
i
didn't
try
the
case,
but
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
judge,
i
can
only
read
to
you,
"in
negligently
failing
to
provide
the
plaintiff
with
proper
equipment
and
safeguards
in
performance
of
his
duties
and
in
the
participation
in
such
a
field
test."
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
in
performing
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
all
i
can
say
is
that
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
we
move
to
strike
all
testimony
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
give
the
test
and
move
to
strike
allegations
(a)
and
(b)
from
the
complaint,
which
on
the
board
knows
is
sufficient.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
we
did
that
too.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
that's
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
not
at
that
time,
no,
sir.
at
the
end
of
the
case
which
under
florida
law
was
sufficient,
those
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
said
no,
just
as
emphatically
as
i
know
how
to
say
it
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
mr.
justice.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
you
can
either.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
i
say
its
contortionist
attempt
to
read
language
that
isn't
there,
to
attempt
to
put
any
such
construction
in
those
paragraphs
particularly
when
the
later
paragraphs
spell
out
that
same
proposition.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
all
i
can
say
is
what
i
have
said
before,
is
that
i
don't
think
that
court
did
or
that
court
could
read
into
that
language,
any
complaint
as
to
the
manner
in
which
the
test
was
conducted.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
while
whether
i
have
to
go
that
far
or
not
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
answered
in
the
affirmative.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
all
sounds
good,
but
if
you'll
just
read
paragraph
(3)
(c)
through
(h)
of
the
same
paragraph,
you'll
see
that
he
properly
alleged
the
things
that
are
involved
here
and
there
wasn't
any
necessity
to
try
to
get
strain
constructions
of
some
language
up
above,
when
it's
clearly
stated
down
below.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
certainly
allowed
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
certainly.
now,
as
to
the
--
there's
been
a
lot
of
talk
here
as
to
the
kind
of
test
and
that
this
be
able
to
something
unusual
and
different.
the
record
is
replete
with
the
fact
that
tests
were
given
everyday
on
the
railroad
as
to
fitness
and
efficiency.
and
the
man's
own
union
chairman,
one
of
those
two
fellows
that
took
the
23
minutes
to
counsel
off
a
little
way,
testified
that
the
only
kind
of
test
that
you
could
give
a
man
under
these
circumstances
was
the
kind
of
test
that
he
was
given.
that's
at
pages
or
--
or
114,
115,
126
to
128.
our
position
is
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
sir?
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
what
he's
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
my
comment
on
that
was
that
he
tried
to
pick
out
that
we
hadn't
had
before
of
mr.
five
by
five
and
hadn't
--
had
to
take
him
out
and
see
whether
or
not,
how
long
it
took
him
to
walk
a
mile
and
whether
he
could
walk
a
mile
or
not.
this
particular
of
a
trainman
to
do
this
particular
thing,
that's
correct,
but
we
had
had
test
everyday
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
we
had
not
had
that
occasion
to
do
it
before,
because
we
hadn't
had
it.
he's
going
to
appreciate,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
particularly
if
you
ride
railroads
that
it
couldn't
be
a
very
happy
situation
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
or
i'd
say,
it
wouldn't
be
a
very
happy
situation.
the
very
--
many
of
our
employees
couldn't
walk
a
mile
when
the
--
their
whole
duty
involved
walking
a
mile
to
protect
the
rail
of
the
train.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
had
to
walk
two
hours.
they
got
to
walk
a
mile
down
and
a
mile
back.
but
is
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
all
sorts
of
tests.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
its
--
it
indicates
generally
that
test
were
given
everyday
as
to
the
efficiency
and
ability
of
the
men
to
perform
their
jobs.
i
don't
recall
there
was
any
detail
as
to
the
kind
of
test.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no
question
about
it.
he
realized
he
couldn't
get
in
anywhere
other
ways.
so
his
whole
theory
was
that
it
was
negligence
per
se
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
give
this
man
a
test.
that
was
the
theory
on
which
he
tried
it
and
he
was
--
the
lower
court
was
reversed
for
permitting
to
try
it
on
that
theory,
because
as
he
conceded
yesterday,
before
the
bar
of
this
court.
of
course,
the
railroad
has
gotten
the
right
to
give
reasonable
efficiency
test.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
with
what
i
don't
agree
with
frates
in
his
construction,
thus
mr.
frates
told
him.
that's
not
the
court
and
that's
the
way
he
did
construe
it.
he's
argued
all
along
that
he
had
a
right
to
try
the
case
on
the
theory
that
it
was
negligence
per
se
when
they
gave
him
a
test.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
many
years.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
oh,
i'd
say
a
considerable
number
of
15,
20,
25
years.
in
fact,
the
doctor
said
it
was
equivalent
to
carrying
125
pounds
around
on
his
back.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no,
he
had
not.
what
had
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
the
record
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
i
think
what
happened
was
that
a
new
man
was
put
in
--
a
new
train
master
was
put
in
charge
of
this
division.
and
regardless
to
the
errors
that
his
predecessors
have
committed,
when
he
came
along
and
saw
mr.
five
by
five
couldn't
even
stand
up
and
get
on
the
lower
step
of
the
coach
without
put
--
put
under
it.
he
figured
that
the
man
could
not
safely
protect
the
rail
of
the
train
and
that's
what
it
brought
this
up.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no
question
about
that.
that
the
new
train
master
who
came
in,
the
new
man
incidentally,
mr.
smith,
just
gotten
out
of
the
hospital
and
come
back.
he'd
have
a
whole
lot
other
trouble.
and
he
came
back
from
the
hospital
claiming
it
was
alright
to
go
back
to
work
and
had
a
certificate
from
the
doctor.
but
the
train
master
after
he
came
back
from
the
hospital
saw
him
walking
around
and
he
just
was
afraid
to
entrust
the
lives
of
his
passengers
to
that
man
without
being
sure
that
the
man
could
perform
his
duties
and
protect
the
rail
of
the
train.
i
figure
that
question
was
going
to
come
up
but
just
because
they
made
errors
in
the
past,
can
maybe
to
risk
passengers'
lives
by
having
a
trainman
who
couldn't
protect
the
rear
of
the
train
properly.
that
isn't
going
to
be
in
the
defense.
if
some
--
if
some
train
plows
into
rear
of
another
and
a
whole
lot
of
people
are
killed
and
hurt,
regardless
of
our
mistakes
in
the
past,
it's
our
duty
to
have
safety
at
the
present
time.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
about
mr.
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
well,
i
have
to
hunt
through
here,
but
i'll
be
glad
to
get
it
and
give
it
to
the
court.
there's
no
dispute
about
the
fact
that
clark
was
a
new
train
master
and
that
when
clark
when
came
on
the
job,
he
apparently
tried
the
remedy
some
of
the
defects
of
his
predecessors.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
mr.
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
in
fact,
i'm
glad
you
asked
that
question
because
that
gives
me
a
chance
to
get
him
out
of
the
point
that
the
red
light
kept
--
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
--
me
off.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir,
but
i
mean
it
to
answer
it,
i
have
to
do
that.
at
the
second
trial,
mr.
frates
attempted
to
proffer,
although
the
supreme
court
had
limited
the
trial
to
the
last
six
issues.
all
of
the
testimony
on
the
first
trial
which
embraced
the
last
six
and
the
first
two
issues,
which
of
course
was
improper.
and
no
additional
testimony
was
proffered.
now
at
the
second
trial,
he
did
get
in
an
additional
allegation
as
to
the
railroad
knowing
this
man
was
sick
and
couldn't
he
put
him
on,
but
he
abandoned
that
allegation
on
appeal.
does
that
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
black?
no
testimony
was
put
on
at
the
second
trial
other
than
to
proffer.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
right.
mr.
harold
b.
wahl
yes,
sir.
and
no
new
testimony
of
any
kind
