--
i
presume
it

would
it
throw
you
out

if
you

justice

that

the

what

you
have
it

it's

it's

preceding
to
the
one
you've

read.
justice

under

construction,
how
can
a
dispute
be
affected

settled.
justice

you
mean
it
leased
it
up,
leased

position
he

that
he
has
to

it

he
may
have

to

in
connection
with
these
jurisdictional

and
there
was
considerable
dissatisfaction,
although
the
congress
has
had
no
way

justice

that
wasn't

there?
justice

may
i
--
i
hope
you
just
--
it's
alright.
i
can't
understand
the
statement
that
this
--
the
heart
of
it
was
taken
out.
as
i
understood
you,
i'm
not
sure,
senator
morse
offered
a
bill
with
two
alternative
methods
to
settle
the
jurisdictional
strike.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
them
wants
to
submit
it
to
the
board
to
settle
the
dispute
and
one
of
them
wants
to
submit
it
to
arbitrators.
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
there
was
left
in,
the
provision
which
were
--
left
it
to
the
board.
justice

well
now
why
--
why
could
anyone
--
i
could

said,
i
don't
understand
it
how
the
mere
fact
that
he
failed
to
get
both
and
they
--
they
refused
to
accept
both
but
did
accept
one.
justice

i
can
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
argument
against
its
reasonableness,
in
fairness,
in
the
way
of
doing
it.
what
i
can't
understand,
why
wouldn't
they
have
two
methods
suggested.
they
got
one
that
takes
out
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
big
difference
in
the
policy
in
issue
isn't
it?
but
what's
the
difference
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
in
construing
it.
if
they
--
if
he
offered
to
have
it
done,
settle
about
one
or
two
ways,
if
congress
refused
to
accept
one
of
his
ways,
how
can
we,
without
trying
to
take
over
the
function
of
the
legislature,
say
that
we
want
to
enforce
them
both.
justice
hugo
l.

is
that
--
is
that
where
senator
taft
offered
the
bill
originally?
how
did
he
offer
it
originally?
was
it
the
outlaw
jurisdiction
as
all
together?
justice
hugo
l.

what
did
he
provide
about?
justice

you're
not

what's
contained
in
first.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
sure
what
it
contained
in
first?
justice
hugo

what
i'm
saying
is
you
do
it
by
arbitration
or
to
say
for
--
that
the
board
doesn't.
justice

i
guess
the
object
is
the

too
to
