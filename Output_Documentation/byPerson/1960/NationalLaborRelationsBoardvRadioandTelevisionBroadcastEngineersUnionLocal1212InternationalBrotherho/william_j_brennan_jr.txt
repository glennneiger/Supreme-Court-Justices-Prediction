is

how

(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

you
think
in
this
instance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
sherman,
to
the
definition
of
the
word
dispute.
i
mentioned
earlier
the
historical
fight
between
carpenters
and
machinists
have
no
right.
now,
the
dispute
in
that
sense,
in
other
words,
this
has
been
a
--
this
has
been
a
controversy
gone
on
for
decades.
is
it
your
thought
that
in
an
action
where
the
carpenters
and
the
machinists
might
be
in
controversy
with
a
particular
employer
that
it
was
contemplated
that
the
board
resolved
that
historical
dispute
over
middle
right
work,
so
that
it
will
inclusive
upon
both
unions
thereafter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
that's
--
that's
a
rather
far
reaching
is
it
mr.
sherman?
in
other
words,
the
basic
underlying
controversy
between
two
unions,
entirely
independent
of
the
employer
would
be
resolved
for
the
two
unions
nationally
and
without
regard
to
the
employer.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
mr.
sherman,
what
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
this.
this
controversy
--
again,
i
go
back
to
no
rights
dispute,
arises
where
these
two
unions
may
be
in
the
same
plant
and
many
sections
in
the
country
and
there
maybe
a
--
a
dispute
in
a
particular
plant
over
no
rights
dispute.
now,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
that
it's
your
view
that
the
board
is
required
by
10
(k)
to
resolve
in
resolving
the
dispute
in
the
particular
plant,
the
whole
controversy
between
the
two
unions
everywhere?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
that
they
don't
resolve
--
they
don't
resolve
that
which
is
to
say
then
than
a
no
rights
dispute
between
the
two
unions,
would
come
up
again
at
another
plant
and
the
board
have
to
go
through
this
all
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
of
course,
the
difficulty
with
the
joint
board
arrangement
is
that
by
contract,
is
it?
that's
by
agreement
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
sherman,
in
the
veto
message
of
president
truman,
you
have
quoted
in
your
brief
one
excerpt
but
i
find
this
--
these
others
in
it.
the
bill
would
require
the
board
to
and
then
quoted
the
word
“determine,”
to
determine
jurisdictional
disputes
of
a
work
tasks
instead
of
using
arbitration,
they
accepted
the
traditional
method
of
settling
such
disputes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
wouldn't
the

out
of
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
does
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
mean
if
the
--
if
the
board
were
to
take
on
the
work
which
the

is
now
doing,
is
there
any

william

i
thought

i
thought
what

just

would
have
no
incentive
to
the
members

the
