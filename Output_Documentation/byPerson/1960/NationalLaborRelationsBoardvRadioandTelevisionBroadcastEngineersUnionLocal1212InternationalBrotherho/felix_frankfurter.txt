years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
i
think
it
will
make
for
the
orderliness
of
your
argument
if
i
don't
interrupt
it
and
now
i
want
to
interrupt
you,
speak
into
aspects
of
the
legislative
history
so
i
hope
you'd
be
able
to
come
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
i
would
be
chipping
away
at
it
because
what
i'm
very
curious
about
is
what
you
tell
us
as
to
the
representations
made
by
business
on
the
one
hand
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
take
any
position
and
labor
on
the
other
hand
because
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
labor
would
want
that
--
wanted
--
want
--
would
want
the
wagner
board,
your
board,
to
settle
jurisdictional
disputes
on
the
merits.
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
you
could
--
if
professor
cox
is
quoted
as
saying
that
he
is
free
of
them,
judge
clark
and
pull
out
of
there
--
out
of
the
record,
he
does
not
see
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
however
--
if
however
the
cio
would
want
the
board
to
settle
the
jurisdictional
disputes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
namely
--
i
mean
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
a
sharing.
they're
involved
--
they
are
part
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
on
the
orders,
whether
there
was
any
spokesman
of
the
either
side,
if
i
may
call
them
side,
who
indicated
the
statement
in
mind
of
these
organized
bodies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
senator
morse's
position
was?
you
--
i
heard
that
you've
said
that
he
was
--
that
this
puts
the
board
into
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
arbitration
and
therefore,
he
was
opposed
to
or
was
he
there
to
come
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
since
it
cut
out
the
appointment
of
an
arbitrator,
well
then,
i
should
think
--
could
deduce
from
that,
from
senator
morse's
position
that
he
wanted
to
put
the
board
into
--
that
that
the
result
would
be
to
put
the
board
--
make
the
board
a
--
an
arbitrator,
compulsory
arbitrator
against
his
wisdom
that
it
should
be
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
there
to
challenge,
did
the
committee
said
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
before
you
get
to
the
conference
report
when
the
bill
was
reported
out
by
the
labor
committee
of
the
senate,
committee
on
labor
and
education
boards.
was
anything
he
said
on
that
subject?
on
this,
on
10
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
cut
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
you
cut
out
an
appointed
arbitrator,
if
that
was
cut
out
why
doesn't
that
lead
the
purpose
just
the
board
to
do
the
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
this
section
in
the
house
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
had
to
be
handed
out
between
the
house
and
the
senate
conferees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
and
the
--
what
light
have
we
besides
this
thing
of
morse's.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
make
any
explicit
comment
on
the
argument
of
compulsory
arbitration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
--
the
committee,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
was
his
bill,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
who
--
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
who
else
dealt
with
senator
morse's
argument
that
this
constituted
compulsory
arbitration?
who
said
something
about
arbitration
among
the
senators
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
the
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
the
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
taft
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
these
to
a
minority
view
both
senator
ellender
and
senator
murray's
minority
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
are
viewed
by
minority
members
of
the
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
became
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
when
the
conference
report
came
before
the
senate,
they
addressed
themselves
for
the
--
to
the
problem
which
came
out
of
the
conference
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
president
truman's
veto
--
would
this
authenticate
an
item
included
in
president
truman's
veto
message?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
he
say
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
follow
that
because
it
grew
out
of
the
jurisdictional
event.
you
are
dealing
with
ab
initio
with
the
jurisdictional
route.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
they
have
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
--
as
mr.
manoli
suggested
that
the
board's
construction
settles
this
jurisdictional
dispute
before
it
makes
the
employer's
selection
with
determinative
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thing
is
that
--
that
if
we
construe
it,
the
board's
role
would
settle
the
jurisdictional
strike
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jurisdiction
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
after
all,
we've
all
known
about
outlaw
strikes.
it
doesn't
--
no
modes
of
settling
conflict
between
two
people.
is
that
absolute
guarantee
that
that
was
the
--
the
determination
of
the
disputes
by
process
of
laws,
the
call
will
settle
that,
but
in
the
normal
instances,
if
--
if
this
is
thrown
back
upon
the
employer
and
it
makes
a
choice
and
the
union
chose
--
does
not
chooses
and
then
refuses
to
abide
by
it,
that's
a
--
just
one
of
the
--
disregards
of
what
the
legal
process
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
â€“
i
understand
that.
in
this
case,
they
--
they
didn't
make
a
choice.
that's
not
the
normal
instance
--
normally
if
--
is
that
the
normal
situation?
do
you
think
this
is
a
typical
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
short,
it
settled
a
dispute
of
--
by
--
at
least
--
by
deciding
it
wasn't
an
either
or
but
there
was
(inaudible),
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
did
he
propose?
what
did
he
--
in
his
message
to
congress,
what
was
he
ready
to
sign
on
jurisdictional
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
that's
the
point
about
all
this
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
now
examined
in
the
legislative
history
hastily
and
therefore
--
and
satisfactorily
but
this
is
what
i
get
out
of
it.
that
undoubtedly,
the
majority
brought
in
a
provision
to
settle
jurisdictional
controversies
by
arbitration
and
placed
reliance
on
an
expert
arbitrator,
not
the
board
itself.
the
minority
consisting,
you
say
there
was
no
spokesman
for
labor,
there
were
no
labor
spokesman
but
there
was
spokesman
for
labor
because
of
independency,
thomas
of
utah,
maria
of
montana
and
pepper
of
florida
did
express
on
the
whole
what
they
thought
was
the
right
way
to
deal
with
labor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
they
said
the
minority's
attack
on
the
majority's
bill
was
on
a
broad
scope.
they
said
that
so
many
provisions
in
your
proposal
that
makes
against
the
desirable
trend
and
what
was
the
desirable
trend
which
case
or
this
deals
--
made
in
(inaudible).
it
was
undue
intervention
by
government
and
the
board
in
particular
into
labor
controversies.
so
what
i
get
out
of
this
in
general
attitude
was
that
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
arbitration
through
arbitrators,
to
individual
arbitrators.
the
minority
opposed
all
kinds
of
intrusion
of
that
sort.
they
opposed
every
aspect
of
settlement
by
--
of
jurisdictional
controversies
through
arbitration.
the
thing
don't
--
then
goes
into
conference
and
out
of
conference
comes
an
excision,
a
deletion
of
the
right
or
part
of
the
arbitration
business,
namely
appointment
of
private
arbit
--
of
--
of
expert
arbitrators
and
we
have
no
light
at
all
as
to
the
meaning
of
what
was
left
except
it
was
for
the
courts
to
determine.
i
think
that
that
--
that's
right
out
of
the
reading
of
that
legislative
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
find
no
such
reference
in
the
minority
report
and
i've
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
that's
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
majority
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
taking
over
interferences
with
what
should
be
left
to
the
free
fighting
of
labor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
find
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
don't
find
that
in
the
minority
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
to
that,
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
doubt
as
to
what
it
meant,
i
think.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
they
cut
the
heart
out
of
it
in
conference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
have
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
have
to
convince
me
and
others
will
have
to
convince
me
to
that.
when
they
eliminated
an
effective
mode
of
arbitration,
they
retained
an
ineffective,
in
fact,
undesirable
mode
of
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
board
settled
it
on
the
merits
that
it
would
be
a
form
of
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
be
using
--
you
wouldn't
be
using
that
language
instead
of
the
form
of
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
hope
you
will
deal
with
the
question
that
mr.
manoli
raised,
namely
as
to
standard
by
which
the
criteria
on
the
basis
of
which
the
board
is
to
become
the
arbitrator
if
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
time
but
i
would
like
to
hear
you
before
you
sit
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
private
arbitrators.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
there's
a
history
of
jurisdictional
settlement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they're
--
and
they're
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
very
different.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
should
have
gone
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
should
have
30
or
100
of
who
should
be
included
in
a
--
under
the
same
roof
within
the
same
legal
unit
is
something
different
than
whether
the
electricians'
electrical
work
should
have
it
or
the
carpenters
should
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
submit
again
that
what
he
had
in
mind
is
a
very
different
thing
that
was
finally
eventuated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
and
do
you
think
here
and
out
of
the
war
whereby,
jammed
around
and
i
think
they
even
â€“
we're
going
to
settle
this,
this
afternoon.
it's
a
very
different
thing
from
the
day
to
day
job
for
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong.
i
--
i
--
my
mind
is
quite
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
caught.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
you're
imposing
a
very
different
responsibility
on
the
board,
then
--
then
senator
morse's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
failed
in
his
endeavor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
failed
in
his
endeavor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
that's
the
crucial
thing
mr.
sherman.
that
to
me
is
so
decisive.
it
had
something
to
do
with
these
matters
in
the
first
world
war.
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
you
can
get
the
whole
momentum
of
the
white
house
across
the
street
from
you
as
i
had
and
you
know
that
--
that
you
can
make
the
kind
of
speech
that
you
ought
to
make
and
there's
war
going
on
and
there
were
specialists
doing
it.
i
don't
think
the
labor
board
--
the
national
labor
board
is
a
specialist
in
this
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
has
to
appoint
the
arbitrator?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
has
to
appoint
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
all
the
difference,
for
one,
for
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
than
for
it
to
do
the
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you
there
are
great
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sherman,
if
you
have
a
statute,
if
you
have
a
proposal,
and
then
senator
morse
(inaudible)
that
the
borad
should
give
a
determination
or
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
and
determine,
that
vary
to
appoint
an
--
an
arbitrator
arbitrates
and
they
â€“
there
you've
got
a
definition
to
--
is
the
very
characterization
of
the
official,
but
with
that
cut
out,
you
haven't
got
any
definition
as
to
an
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
rephrasing
a
provision
of
the
statute
which
is
ambiguous
and
making
it
clearer,
you
do
not
necessarily
answer
the
question
as
to
what
the
unclear
provision
means.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statute
doesn't
read
that
justice
whittaker
has
stated
it.
that
is
the
way
the
statute
reads
out,
you
wouldn't
be
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
board
would
have
acted
differently.
the
statute
doesn't
say
or
didn't
say,
"the
board
shall
have
power
either
to
do
this
directly
or
appoint
an
arbitrator
and
then
struck
it
out."
that
isn't
the
language.
the
language
was
very
different
and
they
struck
out
that
(inaudible)
--
which
there
was
the
severest
attack
without
telling
it
as
to
why
they
struck
it
out
and
what
they
left.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i've
suggested
to
you,
if
you
leave
in
the
word
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
one
knows
what
an
arbitrator
does.
but
the
words
to
hear
and
determine
still
not
leave
you
to
determine
what
the
scope
of
the
determination
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
i
think
it
will
make
for
the
orderliness
of
your
argument
if
i
don't
interrupt
it
and
now
i
want
to
interrupt
you,
speak
into
aspects
of
the
legislative
history
so
i
hope
you'd
be
able
to
come
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
i
would
be
chipping
away
at
it
because
what
i'm
very
curious
about
is
what
you
tell
us
as
to
the
representations
made
by
business
on
the
one
hand
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
take
any
position
and
labor
on
the
other
hand
because
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
labor
would
want
that
--
wanted
--
want
--
would
want
the
wagner
board,
your
board,
to
settle
jurisdictional
disputes
on
the
merits.
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
you
could
--
if
professor
cox
is
quoted
as
saying
that
he
is
free
of
them,
judge
clark
and
pull
out
of
there
--
out
of
the
record,
he
does
not
see
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
however
--
if
however
the
cio
would
want
the
board
to
settle
the
jurisdictional
disputes.
justice
felix

namely
--
i
mean
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
story.
justice

that's
a
different
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
have
a
sharing.
they're
involved
--
they
are
part
of
that.
justice

whether
on
the
orders,
whether
there
was
any
spokesman
of
the
either
side,
if
i
may
call
them
side,
who
indicated
the
statement
in
mind
of
these
organized
bodies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
senator
morse's
position
was?
you
--
i
heard
that
you've
said
that
he
was
--
that
this
puts
the
board
into
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
arbitration
and
therefore,
he
was
opposed
to
or
was
he
there
to
come
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
since
it
cut
out
the
appointment
of
an
arbitrator,
well
then,
i
should
think
--
could
deduce
from
that,
from
senator
morse's
position
that
he
wanted
to
put
the
board
into
--
that
that
the
result
would
be
to
put
the
board
--
make
the
board
a
--
an
arbitrator,
compulsory
arbitrator
against
his
wisdom
that
it
should
be
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
there
to
challenge,
did
the
committee
said
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
manoli,
before
you
get
to
the
conference
report
when
the
bill
was
reported
out
by
the
labor
committee
of
the
senate,
committee
on
labor
and
education
boards.
was
anything
he
said
on
that
subject?
on
this,
on
10
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
cut
out
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
you
cut
out
an
appointed
arbitrator,
if
that
was
cut
out
why
doesn't
that
lead
the
purpose
just
the
board
to
do
the
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
was
this
section
in
the
house
bill?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
had
to
be
handed
out
between
the
house
and
the
senate
conferees.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
--
and
the
--
what
light
have
we
besides
this
thing
of
morse's.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
make
any
explicit
comment
on
the
argument
of
compulsory
arbitration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
--
the
committee,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
was
his
bill,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
who
--
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
ask
you
who
else
dealt
with
senator
morse's
argument
that
this
constituted
compulsory
arbitration?
who
said
something
about
arbitration
among
the
senators
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
the
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
the
war.
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
taft
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
these
to
a
minority
view
both
senator
ellender
and
senator
murray's
minority
views.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
they
are
viewed
by
minority
members
of
the
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
became
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
when
the
conference
report
came
before
the
senate,
they
addressed
themselves
for
the
--
to
the
problem
which
came
out
of
the
conference
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
president
truman's
veto
--
would
this
authenticate
an
item
included
in
president
truman's
veto
message?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
he
say
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
follow
that
because
it
grew
out
of
the
jurisdictional
event.
you
are
dealing
with
ab
initio
with
the
jurisdictional
route.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
would
they
have
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
--
as
mr.
manoli
suggested
that
the
board's
construction
settles
this
jurisdictional
dispute
before
it
makes
the
employer's
selection
with
determinative
things.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thing
is
that
--
that
if
we
construe
it,
the
board's
role
would
settle
the
jurisdictional
strike
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
jurisdiction
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
after
all,
we've
all
known
about
outlaw
strikes.
it
doesn't
--
no
modes
of
settling
conflict
between
two
people.
is
that
absolute
guarantee
that
that
was
the
--
the
determination
of
the
disputes
by
process
of
laws,
the
call
will
settle
that,
but
in
the
normal
instances,
if
--
if
this
is
thrown
back
upon
the
employer
and
it
makes
a
choice
and
the
union
chose
--
does
not
chooses
and
then
refuses
to
abide
by
it,
that's
a
--
just
one
of
the
--
disregards
of
what
the
legal
process
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
â€“
i
understand
that.
in
this
case,
they
--
they
didn't
make
a
choice.
that's
not
the
normal
instance
--
normally
if
--
is
that
the
normal
situation?
do
you
think
this
is
a
typical
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
in
short,
it
settled
a
dispute
of
--
by
--
at
least
--
by
deciding
it
wasn't
an
either
or
but
there
was
(inaudible),
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
did
he
propose?
what
did
he
--
in
his
message
to
congress,
what
was
he
ready
to
sign
on
jurisdictional
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
that's
the
point
about
all
this
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
put
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
now
examined
in
the
legislative
history
hastily
and
therefore
--
and
satisfactorily
but
this
is
what
i
get
out
of
it.
that
undoubtedly,
the
majority
brought
in
a
provision
to
settle
jurisdictional
controversies
by
arbitration
and
placed
reliance
on
an
expert
arbitrator,
not
the
board
itself.
the
minority
consisting,
you
say
there
was
no
spokesman
for
labor,
there
were
no
labor
spokesman
but
there
was
spokesman
for
labor
because
of
independency,
thomas
of
utah,
maria
of
montana
and
pepper
of
florida
did
express
on
the
whole
what
they
thought
was
the
right
way
to
deal
with
labor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
they
said
the
minority's
attack
on
the
majority's
bill
was
on
a
broad
scope.
they
said
that
so
many
provisions
in
your
proposal
that
makes
against
the
desirable
trend
and
what
was
the
desirable
trend
which
case
or
this
deals
--
made
in
(inaudible).
it
was
undue
intervention
by
government
and
the
board
in
particular
into
labor
controversies.
so
what
i
get
out
of
this
in
general
attitude
was
that
there
was
a
specific
provision
for
arbitration
through
arbitrators,
to
individual
arbitrators.
the
minority
opposed
all
kinds
of
intrusion
of
that
sort.
they
opposed
every
aspect
of
settlement
by
--
of
jurisdictional
controversies
through
arbitration.
the
thing
don't
--
then
goes
into
conference
and
out
of
conference
comes
an
excision,
a
deletion
of
the
right
or
part
of
the
arbitration
business,
namely
appointment
of
private
arbit
--
of
--
of
expert
arbitrators
and
we
have
no
light
at
all
as
to
the
meaning
of
what
was
left
except
it
was
for
the
courts
to
determine.
i
think
that
that
--
that's
right
out
of
the
reading
of
that
legislative
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
find
no
such
reference
in
the
minority
report
and
i've
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
then
that's
the
whole
philosophy
of
the
majority
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
taking
over
interferences
with
what
should
be
left
to
the
free
fighting
of
labor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
find
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
i
don't
find
that
in
the
minority
report.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
as
to
that,
there
wouldn't
be
any
--
there
wouldn't
be
any
doubt
as
to
what
it
meant,
i
think.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
they
cut
the
heart
out
of
it
in
conference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
have
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you'll
have
to
convince
me
and
others
will
have
to
convince
me
to
that.
when
they
eliminated
an
effective
mode
of
arbitration,
they
retained
an
ineffective,
in
fact,
undesirable
mode
of
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
senator
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
the
board
settled
it
on
the
merits
that
it
would
be
a
form
of
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
wouldn't
be
using
--
you
wouldn't
be
using
that
language
instead
of
the
form
of
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
sit
down,
i
hope
you
will
deal
with
the
question
that
mr.
manoli
raised,
namely
as
to
standard
by
which
the
criteria
on
the
basis
of
which
the
board
is
to
become
the
arbitrator
if
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
time
but
i
would
like
to
hear
you
before
you
sit
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
private
arbitrators.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
--
if
there's
a
history
of
jurisdictional
settlement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they're
--
and
they're
very
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they're
very
different.
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
should
have
gone
to
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
should
have
30
or
100
of
who
should
be
included
in
a
--
under
the
same
roof
within
the
same
legal
unit
is
something
different
than
whether
the
electricians'
electrical
work
should
have
it
or
the
carpenters
should
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
submit
again
that
what
he
had
in
mind
is
a
very
different
thing
that
was
finally
eventuated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
and
do
you
think
here
and
out
of
the
war
whereby,
jammed
around
and
i
think
they
even
â€“
we're
going
to
settle
this,
this
afternoon.
it's
a
very
different
thing
from
the
day
to
day
job
for
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong.
i
--
i
--
my
mind
is
quite
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
caught.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
you're
imposing
a
very
different
responsibility
on
the
board,
then
--
then
senator
morse's
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
failed
in
his
endeavor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
failed
in
his
endeavor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
that's
the
crucial
thing
mr.
sherman.
that
to
me
is
so
decisive.
it
had
something
to
do
with
these
matters
in
the
first
world
war.
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world.
you
can
get
the
whole
momentum
of
the
white
house
across
the
street
from
you
as
i
had
and
you
know
that
--
that
you
can
make
the
kind
of
speech
that
you
ought
to
make
and
there's
war
going
on
and
there
were
specialists
doing
it.
i
don't
think
the
labor
board
--
the
national
labor
board
is
a
specialist
in
this
domain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
has
to
appoint
the
arbitrator?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
has
to
appoint
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world
and
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
all
the
difference,
for
one,
for
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
than
for
it
to
do
the
job.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
assure
you
there
are
great
differences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
sherman,
if
you
have
a
statute,
if
you
have
a
proposal,
and
then
senator
morse
(inaudible)
that
the
borad
should
give
a
determination
or
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
and
determine,
that
vary
to
appoint
an
--
an
arbitrator
arbitrates
and
they
â€“
there
you've
got
a
definition
to
--
is
the
very
characterization
of
the
official,
but
with
that
cut
out,
you
haven't
got
any
definition
as
to
an
arbitration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
rephrasing
a
provision
of
the
statute
which
is
ambiguous
and
making
it
clearer,
you
do
not
necessarily
answer
the
question
as
to
what
the
unclear
provision
means.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statute
doesn't
read
that
justice
whittaker
has
stated
it.
that
is
the
way
the
statute
reads
out,
you
wouldn't
be
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
board
would
have
acted
differently.
the
statute
doesn't
say
or
didn't
say,
"the
board
shall
have
power
either
to
do
this
directly
or
appoint
an
arbitrator
and
then
struck
it
out."
that
isn't
the
language.
the
language
was
very
different
and
they
struck
out
that
(inaudible)
--
which
there
was
the
severest
attack
without
telling
it
as
to
why
they
struck
it
out
and
what
they
left.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i've
suggested
to
you,
if
you
leave
in
the
word
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
one
knows
what
an
arbitrator
does.
but
the
words
to
hear
and
determine
still
not
leave
you
to
determine
what
the
scope
of
the
determination
should
be.
