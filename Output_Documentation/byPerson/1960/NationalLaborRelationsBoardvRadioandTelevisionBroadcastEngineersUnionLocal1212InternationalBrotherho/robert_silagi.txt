mr.
robert
silagi
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
hope
of
presenting
a
better
argument
to
the
court,
mr.
sherman
and
i
will
divide
our
time.
i
will
devote
my
time
to
a
analysis
of
what
we
think
is
the
affirmative
side
of
our
case,
namely
the
interrelation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
section
10
(k).
the
legislative
history
of
the
--
of
the
statute,
the
applicable
rules
of
the
board
and
the
practical
interpretation
such
as
the
board
says
supports
its
construction.
mr.
sherman
will
devote
himself
to
a
defensive
kind
of
aspect
of
our
case,
namely
the
relationship
of
between
section
8
(b)
4
(d)
and
section
303
(a),
namely
the
situation
which
arises
in
the
juneau
spruce-type
situation
where
an
employer
sues
a
labor
union
for
engaging
in
a
jurisdictional
strike.
mr.
sherman
will
also
cover
that
aspect
of
the
--
of
our
case
which
deals
with
the
interrelationship
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(b)
(2)
in
a
kind
of
situation
which
arises
according
to
the
board's
theory
which
gives
rise
to
a
discriminatory
hire
if
the
board
were
to
follow
the
respondent's
theory
of
this
case.
at
the
outset
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes
sir,
i
shall.
i
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
i'd
be
very
happy
to.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
the
--
the
genesis
of
--
of
this
particular
section
of
the
act
arises
in
senator
morse's
experience
as
a
member
of
the
war
labor
board.
at
his
suggestion,
the
war
labor
board
enacted
as
policy
the
requirement
that
where
there
was
a
jurisdictional
dispute
between
two
labor
unions,
the
parties
were
given
24
hours
to
resolve
that
dispute
on
a
private
voluntary
basis
and
if
they
did
not,
then
they
were
required
to
submit
to
arbitration.
and
of
course,
the
dispute
itself
was
arbitrated
and
actual
determination
was
made
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir
and
that
should
--
mr.
robert
silagi
that's
correct
sir.
now
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
that's
correct
sir.
now,
when
senator
morse
introduced
his
bill
into
the
senate,
he
embodied
the
same
concept
into
his
bill
requiring,
first,
voluntary
settlement
within
a
period
of
10
days
and
then
if
the
parties
could
not
resolved
their
own
dispute,
then
the
board
was
empowered
to
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
arose,
namely
this
very
jurisdictional
dispute.
he
also
provided
that
arbitration
was
to
be
a
--
a
part
of
his
bill
on
the
theory
that
private
arbitrators
had
a
greater
expertise
in
areas
of
this
kind
than
the
board
itself
had.
as
has
been
related
here,
the
house
adopted
a
rather
unsophisticated
approach
to
this
problem
and
they
imposed
a
flat
ban
on
jurisdictional
strikes.
the
senate
adopted
senator
morse's
ideas
on
the
subject
and
interestingly,
they
not
only
said
that
the
board
is
empowered
to
hear
and
determine
the
jurisdictional
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen
but
they
added
the
words
"and
directed"
so
that
there
was
no
choice
on
the
part
--
part
of
the
board
to
hear
or
not
to
hear
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
they
were
compelled
to
under
the
terms
of
senator
morse's
bill
which
then
was
passed
by
the
senate
and
the
same
arbitration
--
private
arbitration
provisions
were
retained
in
the
bill.
now,
the
conference
committee,
to
whom
this
was
referred,
followed
the
senate
bill
but
it
did
two
things.
it
widened
the
scope
of
the
jurisdictional
dispute
previously
under
the
morse
bill.
it
had
been
limited
to
two
unions
and
now,
it
was
broadened
to
encompass
class,
craft
etcetera
and
it
eliminated
from
section
10
(k)
the
provision
for
private
arbitration.
now,
in
answer
to
the
question
--
mr.
robert
silagi
it
compelled
the
board
to
act
as
the
arbitrator.
now,
the
--
the
question
has
been
asked
earlier
of
mr.
manoli
who
was
in
favor
of
this
aside
from
senator
morse
and
i
have
--
mr.
manoli
answered
that
senator
ellender
spoke
in
favor
of
this
concept.
in
addition
to
which
senator
murray
also
stated
that
section
10
(k)
required
the
board
itself
to
arbitrate
the
work
task
jurisdictional
disputes.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
believe
that
he
was
not,
sir.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
silagi
senator
taft
was.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes
sir.
now,
that
this
is
the
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
it
is
the
minority
--
mr.
robert
silagi
that
is
correct.
nevertheless
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
they
were
expressed
at
the
time
the
conference
committee
became
the
act.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
--
the
--
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
the
conference
committee
bill
became
the
act,
this
is
a
discussion
on
the
--
on
the
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir,
he
was.
mr.
robert
silagi
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
now
these
very
same
ideas
were
borne
out
by
the
veto
message
of
--
of
president
truman.
president
truman
objected
to
this
section
of
the
--
of
the
act
on
the
theory
that
in
order
to
invoke
the
processes
of
the
labor
board,
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
union
strike.
then
he
went
on
to
say,
"this
peculiar
situation
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
board
is
given
authority
to
determine
jurisdictional
disputes
over
assignment
of
work
only
after
such
disputes
have
been
converted
into
strikes
of
or
boycotts.
so
it
was
quite
clear
at
least
in
president
truman's
mind
that
it
was
the
board
itself
that
was
going
to
make
the
determination
as
an
arbitrator.
later
on,
under
the
discussion
and
the
debate
on
the
veto
message,
nobody,
whether
in
favor
or
opposed
to
this
bill
had
any
doubt
about
the
duty
of
the
board
to
settle
the
work
allocation
which
was
in
dispute.
and
the
fact
that
the
--
the
--
there
had
been
a
deletion
of
the
provision
to
require
private
arbitration,
did
not
in
itself
change
any
of
the
substantive
functions
of
the
board
requiring
a
board
to
make
this
arbitration
award.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
this
is
--
this
was
his
objection.
the
fact
that
in
order
to
invoke
the
processes
of
the
board
in
order
to
settle
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
the
union
was
first
required
to
engage
in
a
jurisdictional
dispute
which
everyone
agreed
was
wrong
or
something
that
had
to
be
avoided.
apparently,
the
theory
was
that
--
mr.
robert
silagi
that's
correct
sir.
the
president's
view
on
the
matter,
as
i
interpret
them,
would
have
required
that
there
be
some
other
kind
of
procedure
to
get
before
the
board
itself
without
requiring
the
union
to
engage
in
a
strike
such
as
you
have
a
--
a
section
9
petition
which
permits
the
board
to
make
a
determination
or
representation
of
matters.
i
assume
the
president
would
have
preferred
that
a
similar
kind
of
procedure
be
enacted
in
to
the
law
and
this
is
what
he
objected
to,
the
fact
that
it
had
become
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
mr.
robert
silagi
it
says,
"this
peculiar
situation,
referring
back
to
the
fact
that
the
unions
would
have
to
strike
in
order
to
invoke
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
this
is
the
only
way
you
can
get
before
the
board,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
silagi
on
the
10
(k),
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
before
the
board
is
if
someone,
an
employer,
or
a
union
files
a
charge
of
unfair
labor
practice
pursuant
to
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
there
is
no
other
way
of
getting
before
the
board.
mr.
robert
silagi
well
--
mr.
robert
silagi
may
i
refer
then,
your
honor,
to
the
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
certainly.
"this
peculiar
situation
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
board
is
given
authority
to
determine
jurisdictional
disputes
over
assignment
of
work
only
after
such
disputes
have
been
converted
into
strikes
or
boycotts.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
it
--
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
this
--
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
this
indicates
to
the
president's
mind
that
the
board
itself
was
given
the
authority
to
arbitrate.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
it
is.
in
answer
to
--
mr.
robert
silagi
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
well
if
i
may
read
the
--
the
quotation
again,
president
truman
said,
"the
bill
would
force
unions
to
strike
or
to
boycott
if
they
wish
to
have
a
jurisdictional
dispute
settled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
this
peculiar
situation
results
from
the
fact,
the
board
is
given
authority
to
determine
jurisdictional
disputes
over
assignment
of
work
only
after
such
disputes
have
been
converted
into
strikes
or
boycotts."
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
this
is
of
course
what
we
disagree
with.
well,
i'm
--
and
may
i
--
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
--
may
i
refer
to
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
to
show
you
why
and
perhaps
to
--
to
indicate
the
just
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
why
--
what
the
board
did
in
this
case
did
not
determine
the
dispute.
here
was
a
situation
where
two
unions,
the
stagehands
union
and
the
technicians
union,
both
having
contracts
by
--
for
the
instillation
and
operation
of
a
certain
work
task,
namely
lighting
equipment.
i
might
say
that
only
the
technicians
union
had
a
certification.
the
unions
involved
had
each
requested
cbs
to
negotiate
into
their
contracts
a
specific
clause
which
would
cover
this
disputed
work.
cbs
refused
to
do
this
on
the
theory
that
it
could
not
make
an
affirmative
award
of
jurisdiction
to
either
of
the
competing
unions
in
the
face
of
conflicting
claims.
this
is
all
set
forth
in
the
record.
now,
you
might
ask,
if
this
is
the
situation
and
if
the
technicians
union
has
a
certification,
why
then
did
not
the
--
the
technicians
union
go
to
the
labor
board
and
ask
for
a
clarification
of
its
certification?
in
the
board's
brief,
they
quote
senator
taft.
they're
saying
this
is
a
permissible
thing
to
do.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
senator
taft
was
--
was
wrong.
it
just
can't
be
done
and
the
board
itself
has
on
many
occasions
stated
that
a
representation
preceding
any
clarification
of
a
representation
certification
is
not
the
proper
method
to
settle
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
so
the
only
way,
the
parties
in
this
case,
and
the
only
way
the
--
the
technicians
union
could
get
its
dispute
settled
is
by
striking.
now,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
in
this
case,
cbs
did
not
make
a
choice
or
it
made
an
inconsistent
choice.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
i
think
this
is
a
typical
situation
in
a
case
where
both
unions
have
contracts
and
the
employer
either
is
completely
neutral
and
refuses
to
make
a
--
a
choice
or
as
in
this
particular
case,
he
does
make
a
choice
but
he
does
it
inconsistently
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
its
decision
and
this
is
contained
in
our
record
while
we
were
in
the
very
midst
of
handling
this
case
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
the
section
10
(k)
proceeding
and
in
the
midst
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
hearing,
cbs
made
a
--
an
assignment
of
the
identical
work
in
a
different
manner.
this
was
in
relation
to
the
--
to
the
show
which
occurred
on
board
the
steamship
united
states
where
--
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
there
are
only
two
unions
involved
here
which
could
possibly
have
done
this
work
in
--
and
cbs
on
one
hand
in
1957,
decided
that
the
work
belonged
to
the
technicians
and
then
in
1958,
in
the
identical
situation,
decided
that
it
belonged
to
--
mr.
robert
silagi
perhaps
it
kept
a
scorecard
but
this
is
not
the
way
to
keep
the
peace
because
this
doesn't
settle
any
assignment.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
don't
think
it
would
have
settled
the
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
obviously
--
mr.
robert
silagi
the
underlying
jurisdictional
dispute
is
the
home
this
work
belonged.
mr.
robert
silagi
well
what
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
board
pursuant
to
this
--
mr.
robert
silagi
the
board's
order
merely
determined
in
effect
from
the
section
10
(k)
order
or
the
decision
and
determination,
simply
determined
that
the
technicians
union
had
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
which
was
not
the
proper
thing
for
it
to
determine.
the
proper
thing
for
the
board
to
determine
in
section
10
(k)
was
a
determination
of
the
jurisdictional
dispute
itself,
namely
to
whom
does
this
work
alone.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
in
that
limited
sense,
i
think
that
--
that
you're
right.
it
would've
determined
that
very
limited
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
--
i
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
the
board
itself
has
shed
some
light
on
this
problem
in
its
very
first
decision
involving
section
10
(k)
in
the
moore
dry
dock
company
case
where
it
is
said
--
describing
the
functions
--
describing
its
--
describing
its
own
functions
under
section
10
(k)
that
"this
proceeding
being
under
section
10
(k)
has
as
its
sole
object,
the
determination
of
the
dispute.
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
at
this
stage.
the
act
purposefully
postponed
that
to
a
subsequent
thing.
it
is
not
a
representation
proceeding
requiring
certification
of
representatives.
there
is
nothing
in
section
10
(k)
which
either
expressly
or
by
implication,
requires
the
board
to
follow
the
procedure
set
forth
in
section
9.
rather,
it
is
a
proceeding
intended
for
the
resolution
of
the
disputes
arising
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
as
the
language
of
section
10
(k)
plainly
states.
and
in
that
case,
the
very
first
case
which
the
board
decided,
the
board
did
what
the
respondent
claimed
it
should
do,
namely,
it
made
an
award.
and
the
board
said
that
the
international
association
does
not
entitle
to
require
the
employer
to
assign
machinists
to
its
members
and
the
board
went
on
to
say
that
the
united
steel
workers
was
entitled
to
have
the
employer
assign
machinists
--
machinist
work
to
its
members.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
that
was
in
march
1949
and
this
occurred
six
days
prior
to
the
thomas
bill
which
is
mentioned
before.
so
that
at
that
time,
congress
was
considering
the
thomas
bill,
the
only
decision
which
it
had
from
the
board,
was
one
which
is
consistent
with
what
the
respondent
believes
is
the
proper
determination.
now,
the
board
finds
itself,
in
our
opinion,
in
a
dilemma
with
respect
to
contracts.
it
is
obvious
that
nothing
in
the
act
relates
to
contracts
per
se.
the
board
is
simply
entitled
to
make
a
determination
or
the
--
the
exception
clause
rather
besides
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
jurisdictional
dispute
to
occur
unless
there
is
a
board
order
or
certification.
now,
in
order
to
come
out
with
the
right
result,
the
board
has
adopted
incorrect
reasoning
we
believe
and
it
says
that
in
a
situation
such
as
arises
in
the
winslow
bros.
and
smith
company
case
where
there
are
two
unions
involved,
each
having
contracts
then
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
if
the
strike
occurs
and
there's
a
contract
to
support
it
then
it
too
becomes
a
part
of
the
unless
clause.
obviously,
this
is
a
piece
of
administrative
reply
act
which
finds
no
warrant
in
the
--
in
the
statute
itself,
but
the
board
is
compelled
to
adopt
that
kind
of
a
position,
it
has
no
choice
and
this
is
what
it
has
done.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
for
just
a
moment
or
two
to
the
board
rules
and
regulations
covering
this
aspect
and
this
i
think
will
shed
light
on
what
was
a
contemporaneous
construction
at
the
time
the
1947
act
was
passed
and
to
also
show
what
the
board
felt.
the
board's
brief
recites
the
fact
that
its
contemporaneous
construction
and
consistent
construction
has
been
in
a
manner
which
is
now
says
is
the
correct
implication.
but
nevertheless,
back
in
1947
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
fresh
in
everyone's
mind,
the
board
did
adopt
a
regulation,
section
102.73
which
you
will
find
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
8
(a)
and
i
shall
quote
only
the
salient
words.
mr.
robert
silagi
8
(a)
of
the
appendix,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
board
regulation
reads
as
follows,
"upon
the
close
of
the
hearing,
the
board
shall
proceed
to
certify
the
labor
organization
for
the
particular
trade,
craft
or
class
of
employees
as
the
case
may
be
which
shall
perform
the
particular
work
tasks
in
issue
or
to
make
other
disposition
of
the
matter."
we
think
this
is
quite
clear
on
its
face
as
to
what
the
board
construed
its
own
powers
and
duties
to
be.
but
it
if
--
if
it
is
not
sufficiently
clear
then
i
ask
you
turn
to
the
following
page
10
(a)
wherein
the
board
recites
its
statement
of
procedure
explaining
the
very
same
section
of
the
act.
this
is
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
section
101.30
and
i
will
read
only
the
salient
words
again.
"the
board
then
considers
the
evidence
taken
at
the
hearing
and
the
hearing
officer's
analysis
together
with
any
briefs
that
may
be
filed
and
the
oral
argument
if
any
and
it
shows
that
certification
of
the
labor
organization
or
the
particular
trade,
craft
or
class
of
employees
which
shall
perform
the
particular
work
tasks
in
issue."
it
is
significant
that
in
the
statement
of
procedure,
the
board
even
omits
the
language
which
is
contained
in
its
rule
which
says,
"to
make
other
disposition
of
the
matter,"
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
both
the
rule
and
from
its
own
statement
of
procedure
that
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
the
board
itself
felt
that
it
had
a
--
an
--
an
obligation
to
make
an
affirmative
determination
with
respect
to
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
know
of
none.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
robert
silagi
--
third
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
ruled
contrary.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
district
courts
helped
get
into
this
(voice
overlap).
thank
you
very
much,
i
shall
now
ask
mr.
sherman
to
continue.
mr.
robert
silagi
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
hope
of
presenting
a
better
argument
to
the
court,
mr.
sherman
and
i
will
divide
our
time.
i
will
devote
my
time
to
a
analysis
of
what
we
think
is
the
affirmative
side
of
our
case,
namely
the
interrelation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
section
10
(k).
the
legislative
history
of
the
--
of
the
statute,
the
applicable
rules
of
the
board
and
the
practical
interpretation
such
as
the
board
says
supports
its
construction.
mr.
sherman
will
devote
himself
to
a
defensive
kind
of
aspect
of
our
case,
namely
the
relationship
of
between
section
8
(b)
4
(d)
and
section
303
(a),
namely
the
situation
which
arises
in
the
juneau
spruce-type
situation
where
an
employer
sues
a
labor
union
for
engaging
in
a
jurisdictional
strike.
mr.
sherman
will
also
cover
that
aspect
of
the
--
of
our
case
which
deals
with
the
interrelationship
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
8
(a)
(3)
and
8
(b)
(2)
in
a
kind
of
situation
which
arises
according
to
the
board's
theory
which
gives
rise
to
a
discriminatory
hire
if
the
board
were
to
follow
the
respondent's
theory
of
this
case.
at
the
outset
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes
sir,
i
shall.
i
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
i'd
be
very
happy
to.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
the
--
the
genesis
of
--
of
this
particular
section
of
the
act
arises
in
senator
morse's
experience
as
a
member
of
the
war
labor
board.
at
his
suggestion,
the
war
labor
board
enacted
as
policy
the
requirement
that
where
there
was
a
jurisdictional
dispute
between
two
labor
unions,
the
parties
were
given
24
hours
to
resolve
that
dispute
on
a
private
voluntary
basis
and
if
they
did
not,
then
they
were
required
to
submit
to
arbitration.
and
of
course,
the
dispute
itself
was
arbitrated
and
actual
determination
was
made
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir
and
that
should
--
mr.
robert
silagi
that's
correct
sir.
now
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
that's
correct
sir.
now,
when
senator
morse
introduced
his
bill
into
the
senate,
he
embodied
the
same
concept
into
his
bill
requiring,
first,
voluntary
settlement
within
a
period
of
10
days
and
then
if
the
parties
could
not
resolved
their
own
dispute,
then
the
board
was
empowered
to
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
arose,
namely
this
very
jurisdictional
dispute.
he
also
provided
that
arbitration
was
to
be
a
--
a
part
of
his
bill
on
the
theory
that
private
arbitrators
had
a
greater
expertise
in
areas
of
this
kind
than
the
board
itself
had.
as
has
been
related
here,
the
house
adopted
a
rather
unsophisticated
approach
to
this
problem
and
they
imposed
a
flat
ban
on
jurisdictional
strikes.
the
senate
adopted
senator
morse's
ideas
on
the
subject
and
interestingly,
they
not
only
said
that
the
board
is
empowered
to
hear
and
determine
the
jurisdictional
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen
but
they
added
the
words
"and
directed"
so
that
there
was
no
choice
on
the
part
--
part
of
the
board
to
hear
or
not
to
hear
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
they
were
compelled
to
under
the
terms
of
senator
morse's
bill
which
then
was
passed
by
the
senate
and
the
same
arbitration
--
private
arbitration
provisions
were
retained
in
the
bill.
now,
the
conference
committee,
to
whom
this
was
referred,
followed
the
senate
bill
but
it
did
two
things.
it
widened
the
scope
of
the
jurisdictional
dispute
previously
under
the
morse
bill.
it
had
been
limited
to
two
unions
and
now,
it
was
broadened
to
encompass
class,
craft
etcetera
and
it
eliminated
from
section
10
(k)
the
provision
for
private
arbitration.
now,
in
answer
to
the
question
--
mr.
robert
silagi
it
compelled
the
board
to
act
as
the
arbitrator.
now,
the
--
the
question
has
been
asked
earlier
of
mr.
manoli
who
was
in
favor
of
this
aside
from
senator
morse
and
i
have
--
mr.
manoli
answered
that
senator
ellender
spoke
in
favor
of
this
concept.
in
addition
to
which
senator
murray
also
stated
that
section
10
(k)
required
the
board
itself
to
arbitrate
the
work
task
jurisdictional
disputes.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
believe
that
he
was
not,
sir.
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
silagi
senator
taft
was.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes
sir.
now,
that
this
is
the
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
it
is
the
minority
--
mr.
robert
silagi
that
is
correct.
nevertheless
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
they
were
expressed
at
the
time
the
conference
committee
became
the
act.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
--
the
--
at
the
time
--
at
the
time
the
conference
committee
bill
became
the
act,
this
is
a
discussion
on
the
--
on
the
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir,
he
was.
mr.
robert
silagi
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
now
these
very
same
ideas
were
borne
out
by
the
veto
message
of
--
of
president
truman.
president
truman
objected
to
this
section
of
the
--
of
the
act
on
the
theory
that
in
order
to
invoke
the
processes
of
the
labor
board,
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
union
strike.
then
he
went
on
to
say,
"this
peculiar
situation
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
board
is
given
authority
to
determine
jurisdictional
disputes
over
assignment
of
work
only
after
such
disputes
have
been
converted
into
strikes
of
or
boycotts.
so
it
was
quite
clear
at
least
in
president
truman's
mind
that
it
was
the
board
itself
that
was
going
to
make
the
determination
as
an
arbitrator.
later
on,
under
the
discussion
and
the
debate
on
the
veto
message,
nobody,
whether
in
favor
or
opposed
to
this
bill
had
any
doubt
about
the
duty
of
the
board
to
settle
the
work
allocation
which
was
in
dispute.
and
the
fact
that
the
--
the
--
there
had
been
a
deletion
of
the
provision
to
require
private
arbitration,
did
not
in
itself
change
any
of
the
substantive
functions
of
the
board
requiring
a
board
to
make
this
arbitration
award.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
this
is
--
this
was
his
objection.
the
fact
that
in
order
to
invoke
the
processes
of
the
board
in
order
to
settle
a
jurisdictional
dispute,
the
union
was
first
required
to
engage
in
a
jurisdictional
dispute
which
everyone
agreed
was
wrong
or
something
that
had
to
be
avoided.
apparently,
the
theory
was
that
--
mr.
robert
silagi
that's
correct
sir.
the
president's
view
on
the
matter,
as
i
interpret
them,
would
have
required
that
there
be
some
other
kind
of
procedure
to
get
before
the
board
itself
without
requiring
the
union
to
engage
in
a
strike
such
as
you
have
a
--
a
section
9
petition
which
permits
the
board
to
make
a
determination
or
representation
of
matters.
i
assume
the
president
would
have
preferred
that
a
similar
kind
of
procedure
be
enacted
in
to
the
law
and
this
is
what
he
objected
to,
the
fact
that
it
had
become
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
mr.
robert
silagi
it
says,
"this
peculiar
situation,
referring
back
to
the
fact
that
the
unions
would
have
to
strike
in
order
to
invoke
the
settlement
of
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
this
is
the
only
way
you
can
get
before
the
board,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
silagi
on
the
10
(k),
the
only
way
you
can
get
the
before
the
board
is
if
someone,
an
employer,
or
a
union
files
a
charge
of
unfair
labor
practice
pursuant
to
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
there
is
no
other
way
of
getting
before
the
board.
mr.
robert
silagi
well
--
mr.
robert
silagi
may
i
refer
then,
your
honor,
to
the
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
certainly.
"this
peculiar
situation
arises
from
the
fact
that
the
board
is
given
authority
to
determine
jurisdictional
disputes
over
assignment
of
work
only
after
such
disputes
have
been
converted
into
strikes
or
boycotts.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
it
--
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
this
--
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
this
indicates
to
the
president's
mind
that
the
board
itself
was
given
the
authority
to
arbitrate.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
it
is.
in
answer
to
--
mr.
robert
silagi
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes.
well
if
i
may
read
the
--
the
quotation
again,
president
truman
said,
"the
bill
would
force
unions
to
strike
or
to
boycott
if
they
wish
to
have
a
jurisdictional
dispute
settled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
this
peculiar
situation
results
from
the
fact,
the
board
is
given
authority
to
determine
jurisdictional
disputes
over
assignment
of
work
only
after
such
disputes
have
been
converted
into
strikes
or
boycotts."
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
this
is
of
course
what
we
disagree
with.
well,
i'm
--
and
may
i
--
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
--
may
i
refer
to
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case
to
show
you
why
and
perhaps
to
--
to
indicate
the
just
--
mr.
justice
whittaker
why
--
what
the
board
did
in
this
case
did
not
determine
the
dispute.
here
was
a
situation
where
two
unions,
the
stagehands
union
and
the
technicians
union,
both
having
contracts
by
--
for
the
instillation
and
operation
of
a
certain
work
task,
namely
lighting
equipment.
i
might
say
that
only
the
technicians
union
had
a
certification.
the
unions
involved
had
each
requested
cbs
to
negotiate
into
their
contracts
a
specific
clause
which
would
cover
this
disputed
work.
cbs
refused
to
do
this
on
the
theory
that
it
could
not
make
an
affirmative
award
of
jurisdiction
to
either
of
the
competing
unions
in
the
face
of
conflicting
claims.
this
is
all
set
forth
in
the
record.
now,
you
might
ask,
if
this
is
the
situation
and
if
the
technicians
union
has
a
certification,
why
then
did
not
the
--
the
technicians
union
go
to
the
labor
board
and
ask
for
a
clarification
of
its
certification?
in
the
board's
brief,
they
quote
senator
taft.
they're
saying
this
is
a
permissible
thing
to
do.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
senator
taft
was
--
was
wrong.
it
just
can't
be
done
and
the
board
itself
has
on
many
occasions
stated
that
a
representation
preceding
any
clarification
of
a
representation
certification
is
not
the
proper
method
to
settle
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
so
the
only
way,
the
parties
in
this
case,
and
the
only
way
the
--
the
technicians
union
could
get
its
dispute
settled
is
by
striking.
now,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
in
this
case,
cbs
did
not
make
a
choice
or
it
made
an
inconsistent
choice.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
i
think
this
is
a
typical
situation
in
a
case
where
both
unions
have
contracts
and
the
employer
either
is
completely
neutral
and
refuses
to
make
a
--
a
choice
or
as
in
this
particular
case,
he
does
make
a
choice
but
he
does
it
inconsistently
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
pointed
out
in
its
decision
and
this
is
contained
in
our
record
while
we
were
in
the
very
midst
of
handling
this
case
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
on
the
section
10
(k)
proceeding
and
in
the
midst
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
hearing,
cbs
made
a
--
an
assignment
of
the
identical
work
in
a
different
manner.
this
was
in
relation
to
the
--
to
the
show
which
occurred
on
board
the
steamship
united
states
where
--
mr.
robert
silagi
well,
there
are
only
two
unions
involved
here
which
could
possibly
have
done
this
work
in
--
and
cbs
on
one
hand
in
1957,
decided
that
the
work
belonged
to
the
technicians
and
then
in
1958,
in
the
identical
situation,
decided
that
it
belonged
to
--
mr.
robert
silagi
perhaps
it
kept
a
scorecard
but
this
is
not
the
way
to
keep
the
peace
because
this
doesn't
settle
any
assignment.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
don't
think
it
would
have
settled
the
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so.
obviously
--
mr.
robert
silagi
the
underlying
jurisdictional
dispute
is
the
home
this
work
belonged.
mr.
robert
silagi
well
what
--
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
board
pursuant
to
this
--
mr.
robert
silagi
the
board's
order
merely
determined
in
effect
from
the
section
10
(k)
order
or
the
decision
and
determination,
simply
determined
that
the
technicians
union
had
violated
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
which
was
not
the
proper
thing
for
it
to
determine.
the
proper
thing
for
the
board
to
determine
in
section
10
(k)
was
a
determination
of
the
jurisdictional
dispute
itself,
namely
to
whom
does
this
work
alone.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
in
that
limited
sense,
i
think
that
--
that
you're
right.
it
would've
determined
that
very
limited
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
--
i
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
robert
silagi
i
think
the
board
itself
has
shed
some
light
on
this
problem
in
its
very
first
decision
involving
section
10
(k)
in
the
moore
dry
dock
company
case
where
it
is
said
--
describing
the
functions
--
describing
its
--
describing
its
own
functions
under
section
10
(k)
that
"this
proceeding
being
under
section
10
(k)
has
as
its
sole
object,
the
determination
of
the
dispute.
it
is
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
at
this
stage.
the
act
purposefully
postponed
that
to
a
subsequent
thing.
it
is
not
a
representation
proceeding
requiring
certification
of
representatives.
there
is
nothing
in
section
10
(k)
which
either
expressly
or
by
implication,
requires
the
board
to
follow
the
procedure
set
forth
in
section
9.
rather,
it
is
a
proceeding
intended
for
the
resolution
of
the
disputes
arising
under
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
as
the
language
of
section
10
(k)
plainly
states.
and
in
that
case,
the
very
first
case
which
the
board
decided,
the
board
did
what
the
respondent
claimed
it
should
do,
namely,
it
made
an
award.
and
the
board
said
that
the
international
association
does
not
entitle
to
require
the
employer
to
assign
machinists
to
its
members
and
the
board
went
on
to
say
that
the
united
steel
workers
was
entitled
to
have
the
employer
assign
machinists
--
machinist
work
to
its
members.
mr.
robert
silagi
yes,
sir.
that
was
in
march
1949
and
this
occurred
six
days
prior
to
the
thomas
bill
which
is
mentioned
before.
so
that
at
that
time,
congress
was
considering
the
thomas
bill,
the
only
decision
which
it
had
from
the
board,
was
one
which
is
consistent
with
what
the
respondent
believes
is
the
proper
determination.
now,
the
board
finds
itself,
in
our
opinion,
in
a
dilemma
with
respect
to
contracts.
it
is
obvious
that
nothing
in
the
act
relates
to
contracts
per
se.
the
board
is
simply
entitled
to
make
a
determination
or
the
--
the
exception
clause
rather
besides
that
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
jurisdictional
dispute
to
occur
unless
there
is
a
board
order
or
certification.
now,
in
order
to
come
out
with
the
right
result,
the
board
has
adopted
incorrect
reasoning
we
believe
and
it
says
that
in
a
situation
such
as
arises
in
the
winslow
bros.
and
smith
company
case
where
there
are
two
unions
involved,
each
having
contracts
then
in
that
kind
of
a
situation,
if
the
strike
occurs
and
there's
a
contract
to
support
it
then
it
too
becomes
a
part
of
the
unless
clause.
obviously,
this
is
a
piece
of
administrative
reply
act
which
finds
no
warrant
in
the
--
in
the
statute
itself,
but
the
board
is
compelled
to
adopt
that
kind
of
a
position,
it
has
no
choice
and
this
is
what
it
has
done.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
for
just
a
moment
or
two
to
the
board
rules
and
regulations
covering
this
aspect
and
this
i
think
will
shed
light
on
what
was
a
contemporaneous
construction
at
the
time
the
1947
act
was
passed
and
to
also
show
what
the
board
felt.
the
board's
brief
recites
the
fact
that
its
contemporaneous
construction
and
consistent
construction
has
been
in
a
manner
which
is
now
says
is
the
correct
implication.
but
nevertheless,
back
in
1947
when
the
taft-hartley
act
was
fresh
in
everyone's
mind,
the
board
did
adopt
a
regulation,
section
102.73
which
you
will
find
in
the
respondent's
brief
at
page
8
(a)
and
i
shall
quote
only
the
salient
words.
mr.
robert
silagi
8
(a)
of
the
appendix,
sir.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
board
regulation
reads
as
follows,
"upon
the
close
of
the
hearing,
the
board
shall
proceed
to
certify
the
labor
organization
for
the
particular
trade,
craft
or
class
of
employees
as
the
case
may
be
which
shall
perform
the
particular
work
tasks
in
issue
or
to
make
other
disposition
of
the
matter."
we
think
this
is
quite
clear
on
its
face
as
to
what
the
board
construed
its
own
powers
and
duties
to
be.
but
it
if
--
if
it
is
not
sufficiently
clear
then
i
ask
you
turn
to
the
following
page
10
(a)
wherein
the
board
recites
its
statement
of
procedure
explaining
the
very
same
section
of
the
act.
this
is
found
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
section
101.30
and
i
will
read
only
the
salient
words
again.
"the
board
then
considers
the
evidence
taken
at
the
hearing
and
the
hearing
officer's
analysis
together
with
any
briefs
that
may
be
filed
and
the
oral
argument
if
any
and
it
shows
that
certification
of
the
labor
organization
or
the
particular
trade,
craft
or
class
of
employees
which
shall
perform
the
particular
work
tasks
in
issue."
it
is
significant
that
in
the
statement
of
procedure,
the
board
even
omits
the
language
which
is
contained
in
its
rule
which
says,
"to
make
other
disposition
of
the
matter,"
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
from
both
the
rule
and
from
its
own
statement
of
procedure
that
at
the
time
this
statute
was
enacted,
the
board
itself
felt
that
it
had
a
--
an
--
an
obligation
to
make
an
affirmative
determination
with
respect
to
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
robert
silagi
no,
sir.
i
know
of
none.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
robert
silagi
--
third
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
have
ruled
contrary.
mr.
robert
silagi
the
district
courts
helped
get
into
this
(voice
overlap).
thank
you
very
much,
i
shall
now
ask
mr.
sherman
to
continue.
