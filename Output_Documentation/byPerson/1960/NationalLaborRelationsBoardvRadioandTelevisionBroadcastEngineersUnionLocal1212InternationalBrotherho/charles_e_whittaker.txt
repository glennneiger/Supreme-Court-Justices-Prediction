justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
mr.
manoli,
isn't
it
true
that
the
consequence
or
the
necessary
effect
of
what
the
board
appear
--
did
determine,
went
beyond
what
you've
just
said.
here,
there
was
a
controversy
as
to
whether
the
employer
or
the
electricians
should
control
this
work.
the
board
said,
"we
find
that
the
electricians
do
not
have
this
work,
then
that
leave
it
to
the
employer
and
hasn't
you
then
met
the
whole
statutes
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
--
you
didn't
go
that
far,
did
you,
mr.
manoli?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
you
were
just
answering
to
mr.
justice
brennan
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
would
not
go
so
far
as
the
court
of
appeals
requires
you
to
go.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
did
not
you
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
go
fully
as
far
necessarily
as
the
board
held
you
should.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
that
determine
this
dispute
to
use
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
silagi.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
please
tell
me
if
there
had
been
no
appeal
from
the
board's
order
here
or
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
before
it
reversed
it,
would
that
have
settled
the
dispute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
mean
nevertheless,
than
it's
settled.
let
me
use
the
language
of
the
statute,
determine
the
dispute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
--
what
dispute
would
have
--
what
part
of
the
dispute
would
–
thus
has
not
been
determined?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
another
dispute
isn't
it?
isn't
that
another
dispute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
dispute
that
was
before
the
board
was
whether
you
were
entitled
to
this
work.
the
employer
said
no,
you
said
yes,
isn't
that
right?
wouldn't
that
be
a
dispute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
was
that
dispute
determined
by
this
order
of
the
board?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assume
there
had
been
no
appeal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
on
that
--
that
that
maybe
to
engraft
a
new
question
on
to
the
original
question
as
to
whom
the
--
the
work
belonged.
was
not
the
dispute,
existing
between
cbs
and
the
electrical
workers,
the
latter
claiming
the
work
and
cbs
denying
that
they
were
entitled
to
it,
wasn't
that
the
dispute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
the
electricity
--
electricians
were
ruled
not
to
be
entitled
to
it.
now,
if
that
was
the
final
judgment,
would
that
not
determine
the
dispute?
there
maybe
other
disputes
but
not
that
one.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
doesn't
that
discharge
fully
the
duties
of
the
board
under
10
(k)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
--
well
i
am
seeking
enlighten.
i
don't
know
but
i'm
just
asking
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
isn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
not
what
that
language
really
means?
he's
got
any
proceeding
here
shall
be
through
the
board.
it
may
act
itself
or
it
may
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
do
so.
now,
the
conference
struck
out
the
alternative
leaving
as
the
statute
now
leaves
the
language,
the
board
is
directed
to
determine
the
dispute.
isn't
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
whereas
all
by
striking
out
this
alternative,
they
didn't
--
the
one
they
didn't
weaken
the
other,
did
they?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
wasn't
that
language
very
different?
i'd
--
i
--
i
understood
that
it's
so.
i
still
