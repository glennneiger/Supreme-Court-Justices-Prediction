mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
in
general,
the
case
deals
with
the
function
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
administering
the
so-called
jurisdictional
disputes
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
disposition
which
the
board
is
to
make
of
these
disputes
under
the
statute.
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
of
the
statute
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
labor
organization
to
engage
in
a
strike
on
a
work
stoppage
to
force
an
employer
to
assign
particular
work
to
the
members
of
a
labor
organization
--
the
members
of
one
labor
organization
for
trade
or
craft
or
group
rather
than
to
those
of
another,
unless
the
employer
is
failing
to
conform
to
a
board
order
or
certification
determining
the
bargain
representative
of
employees
performing
such
work.
section
10
(k)
of
the
statute
provides
that
whenever
there
is
a
charge
alleging
a
violation
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
the
board
is
empower
--
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
ought
of
which
the
unfair
labor
--
the
alleged
unfair
labor
practice
arose,
unless
the
parties
have
agreed
upon
voluntary
methods
for
the
settlement,
the
adjustment
of
the
underlying
dispute.
now,
these
provisions
of
the
statute
have
given
rise
to
two
schools
of
thought,
as
to
the
function
of
the
board
in
adjusting
these
jurisdictional
disputes
in
the
absence
of
a
preexisting
board
order
or
certification
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
three
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
section
10
(k)
requires
the
board
in
the
absence
of
a
board
order
or
certification
within
the
meaning
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
that
section
10
(k)
requires
the
board
to
arbitrate
the
dispute.
and
on
the
basis
of
such
matters
as
tradition,
practice
and
custom,
to
affirmatively
award
the
work
to
one
union
to
the
members
of
one
group
or
the
others.
now,
the
board
on
the
other
hand
and
the
fifth
circuit
and
perhaps
the
ninth
circuit
have
taken
the
position
that
the
board
discharges
its
function.
in
such,
under
section
10
(k)
when
it
determined
solely
whether
the
disputed
assignment
of
work
is
in
derogation
of
a
board
order
or
certification
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
as
i
shall
explain
later
in
derogation
of
a
collective
bargaining
contract
covering
the
assignment
of
this
work.
now,
the
question
before
this
court
in
these
cases
is
which
of
these
views
is
the
correct
view.
now,
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
controversy
and
the
particular
case
here
are
not
in
dispute
and
i
shall
summarize
them
very
briefly.
the
electrical
workers
union
and
the
stagehands
union,
they
have
a
big
long
name
but
i'll
call
them
stagehands
union.
the
stagehands
unions
represent
various
technicians
of
the
columbia
broadcasting
company.
for
many
years,
there's
been
a
dispute
between
these
two
unions
as
to
--
as
to
which
of
them
is
entitled
to
perform
what
is
called
remote
lighting
work.
and
remote
lighting
work,
as
i
understand
from
the
record,
involves
the
install
--
the
installations
--
the
installation
and
the
operation
of
lighting
equipment
in
connection
with
a
telecast
which
originates
our
way
from
the
home
studio
of
the
broadcasting
company.
now,
during
the
period
in
question
here,
both
unions
had
collective
bargaining
contracts
with
the
columbia
broadcasting
company
but
either
contract,
however,
covered
the
assignment
of
this
disputed
work.
and
the
dispute
came
to
ahead
in
1956
in
connection
with
a
show
which
the
company
was
about
to
televise
or
telecast,
whatever
the
verb
is,
from
the
waldorf-astoria
hotel
in
new
york
city.
in
advance
of
the
show,
the
company
informed
the
electrical
workers
that
it
was
going
to
assign
this
remote
--
remote
lighting
work.
it
was
going
to
assign
it
for
the
stagehands.
the
electricians
protested
claiming
that
they
were
entitled
to
this
work
and
that
they
would
be
--
that
there
would
be
the
nature
of
control
unless
they
got
it.
now,
the
company
refused
to
exceed
to
this
request
and
the
upshot
was
that
the
electrical
workers
refused
to
operate
the
cameras
which
was
necessary
in
order
to
televise
the
show
and
as
a
consequence,
the
show
was
canceled.
now,
the
company
then
filed
charges
with
the
board
alleging
that
this
work
stoppage
by
the
electricians
was
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d),
which
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
a
union
to
strike
to
force
an
employer
to
assign
particular
work
with
members
of
one
group
or
another
unless
it
is
governed
by
--
unless
the
employer's
assignment
of
the
work
is
in
derogation
of
a
preexisting
board
order
certification
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
upon
these
charges,
when
these
charges
were
filed,
then
the
board
proceeded
to
the
preliminary
hearing
that
section
10
(k)
requires.
section
10
(k),
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
empowers
and
directs
the
board
whenever
a
charge
is
filed
alleging
a
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
is
a
reference
to
a
hearing
officer.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
to
a
hearing
officer
but
there
is
no
report,
your
honor.
the
matter
then
goes
directly
to
the
board
and
the
board
then
will
make
a
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly,
exactly.
now,
in
the
section
10
(k)
proceedings,
after
the
hearings
before
a
hearing
officer
and
on
the
record
made
before
him,
the
board
determined
that
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
work
stoppage
was
in
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
this
was
an
--
not
ultimate
determination
on
the
facts
but
a
determination,
there
was
probable
cause
for
believing
that
the
work
stoppage
was
within
the
proscription
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
the
board
also
found
in
that
case
that
the
employer's
assignment
of
this
disputed
remote
lighting
work
was
not
in
derogation
of
an
existing
board
order
or
certification
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
our
theory,
your
honor.
and
since
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
dispute.
since
the
--
since
the
employer's
assignment,
as
i
say,
was
not
in
derogation
of
a
board
order
certification
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
perhaps
--
well,
the
--
i
think
that
we
take
the
view,
we
take
the
view
that
the
board
discharges
its
functions
of
10
(k)
when
it
determines
whether
or
not
the
employer's
assignment
of
the
work
is
in
derogation
of
a
board
order
or
certification
within
the
meaning
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
exactly.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that's
the
argument
--
the
dispute
here,
your
honor.
we
say
we
are
--
that
the
board
need
not
go
beyond
making
that
finding.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
perhaps
i
don't
understand
the
--
for
the
question
but
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we,
don't.
we
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
in
this
case,
as
i
said,
made
the
determination
of
the
10
(k)
hearing
that
the
employer's
assignment
of
this
work
was
not
in
derogation
of
a
board
order
or
certification
determining
the
bargaining
representative
of
employers
performing
such
work.
second,
it
had
rejected.
the
board
had
rejected
the
offer
of
proof
on
the
part
of
the
union
that
was
entitled
to
this
work
by
virtue
of
a
past
practice.
the
board
has
taken
the
position,
past
practice,
tradition
or
what
have
you
is
irrelevant
to
the
determination
of
this
kind.
and
therefore,
the
board
then
continue
to
found
that
the
union
was
not
entitled
to
this
work
since
this
work
was
not
controlled
by
a
board
order
or
certification
within
the
meaning
of
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
i
think
is
one
of
our
problems
whether
that
is
a
determination
of
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
[laughs]
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
arose
for
the
lunch
and
recess,
i
was
attempting
to
set
forth
some
of
the
incongruities
which
we
think
that
the
decision
below
gives
rise
to
--
particularly
in
connection
with
section
303
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
that
section
as
i
explained
gives
a
right
to
anyone
who
has
been
injured
in
his
business
by
one
of
these
jurisdictional
dispute
strikes,
the
right
to
bring
a
suit
for
damages.
that
section
does
not
create
a
different
right
than
is
created
in
section
8
(b)
4
(d)
or
a
different
offense
and
is
created
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
but
adds
the
sanctions
of
a
cease
and
desist
order,
the
sanctions
of
damages.
and
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
juneau
spruce
case
decided
some
six
or
seven
years
ago,
this
court
made
clear
in
that
case,
the
elements
of
the
offence
under
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
303
are
the
same
and
that
prosecution
for
damages
under
303
is
in
no
way
dependent
upon
an
antecedent
for
determination
under
section
10
(k).
under
section
303,
as
under
section
8
(b)
4
(d),
a
claim
to
a
disputed
work
based
upon
tradition,
custom
or
what
have
you
is
irrelevant.
now,
we
believe
that
if
the
--
that
if
the
offense
in
--
under
section
303
is
established
as
the
statute
says
is
established
by
showing
that
the
employer's
--
by
showing
that
the
employer's
assignment
is
not
in
derogation
of
a
board
certificate
or
order
within
the
meaning
of
8
(b)
4
(d),
then
tradition
and
practice
are
irrelevant
to
a
section
303
action
and
if
they
are
irrelevant
to
a
section
303
action,
we
believe
that
they
are
also
irrelevant
under
8
(b)
4
(d)
as
well
as
section
10
(k)
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
that's
right.
due
--
there
had
been
a
situation
where
the
board
has
found
an
8
(b)
4
(d)
violation
or
rather
no
violation
of
8
(b)
4
(d)
but
a
district
court
has.
but
the
court
of
--
the
--
this
court
made
clear
in
the
juneau
spruce
case
however,
that
a
section
303
action
is
not
dependent
upon
a
prior
board
determination
in
a
section
10
(k)
hearing.
now,
if
tradition
and
custom
are
irrelevant
to
a
303
action,
as
i
say,
we
think
they
are
also
irrelevant
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute
that
the
board
administers
because
if
it
were
not
so
--
if
it
were
not
so,
you
would
have
the
rather
startling
result
that
a
strike
could
be
illegal
under
303
for
purposes
of
awarding
damages
and
yet
lawful
under
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
statute.
decisions
below
leads
not
only
to
this
incongruity
but
it
also
cuts
across,
we
think
--
it
also
cuts
across
of
what
--
one
of
the
most
basic
policies
of
the
statute,
namely
the
policy
against
discrimination
in
employment
which
encourages
or
discourages
union
membership.
under
the
statute,
an
employer
has
the
inherent
right
to
select
his
employees
and
make
his
work
assignments.
the
principle
restriction
which
a
statue
imposes
upon
the
exercise
of
that
right
is
that
it
shall
not
be
exercised
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
so
as
to
encourage
or
discourage
union
membership.
but
the
ruling
below
which
would
require
the
board
to
award
--
award
work
affirmatively
to
the
members
of
one
union
or
another
under
the
basis
of
tradition,
custom
and
the
like,
would
foster
through
the
section
10
(k)
proceedings
a
circumvention
of
this
policy
against
discrimination.
now,
let
me
illustrate.
suppose
that
you
had
an
employer
whose
employees
are
presently
members
of
or
represented
by
union
a
and
that
that
employer
has
obtained
a
job.
union
b
claiming
that
its
members
are
entitled
to
this
kind
of
work
puts
pressure
upon
him
to
give
its
members
to
--
or
puts
pressure
upon
the
employer
to
give
the
work
to
his
members.
now,
the
employer
can
either
discharge
his
employees
and
--
and
replace
them
with
members
of
union
b
or
it
can
give
up
the
job
altogether.
in
either
case,
there
is
discrimination
against
his
employers
by
reason
of
their
non-membership
in
union
b.
let
me
cite
one
more
example.
often,
the
jurisdictional
disputes
pit
a
union
against
an
--
an
unorganized
group
of
employees.
if
tradition
or
custom
were
to
be
controlling
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
chances
are
that
in
--
in
most
cases,
the
union
would
probably
prevail
as
against
the
unorganized
group
because
the
union
undoubtedly
couldn't
make
a
better
showing
of
tradition
or
custom
or
practice
in
support
of
its
claim
than
could
the
unorganized
group.
again,
you
would
have
encouragement
of
the
unorganized
group
to
join
the
union
which
obtained
the
--
the
work
by
virtue
of
its
claims
based
upon
tradition
or
custom
or
practice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
unanimity
among
all
the
members
of
congress
who
passed
this
statute
that
jurisdictional
disputes
were
bad
and
they
were
against
that
just
as
they
were
against
sin
but
there
was
quite
--
they
were
divided
as
to
how
to
reach
heaven
one
might
say
in
how
to
settle
these
disputes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
as
i
--
i
shall
--
as
i
shall
explain
in
a
moment
i'm
getting
to
it.
when
we
come
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you
will
see
that
while
there
was
--
some
of
the
legislators
hope
that
this
would
give
the
board
the
power
to
arbitrate
these
disputes
and
settle
them
once
and
for
all
that
after
the
conference
committee
got
through
with
the
bills
and
that
i
will
explain
this
shortly.
after
we've
--
conference
committee
got
through
with
the
bills,
there
was
very
little
left
to
that
at
least
as
we
read
the
legislative
history.
that
all
that
was
left
as
we
see
it,
all
was
left
to
the
board
was
simply
to
determine
a
section
10
(k)
hearing,
whether
or
not
he
employer's
assignment
was
in
derogation
--
was
in
derogation
of
a
certificate
or
a
--
or
an
order
of
the
board
which
had
been
issued
in
a
representation
or
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
justice
black
however,
suggested
that
if
the
congress
meant
to
have
the
board
settle
that
--
and
i'm
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
i
say,
there
was
unanimity
on
the
part
of
congress
that
these
were
bad
things
but
they
--
they
didn't
perhaps
choose
an
adequate
method
for
resolving
the
basic
underlying
disputes,
though
the
statute
does
not
afford
that
kind
of
solution
to
this
problem.
now
it
maybe
that
this
are
the
kind
of
a
problem
that
congress
left
to
take
a
look
again
and
a
--
take
a
look
into,
but
as
we
read
this
statute
it
does
not
permit
the
board
to
resolve
the
underlying
jurisdictional
dispute
between
the
no
rights
of
the
carpenters.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
arguments
have
been
going
out
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
all
in
their
--
their
long
standing
disputes
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
turning
to
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
professor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that's
been
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
the
--
whether
he
really
would
want
to.
however
though,
professor
cox
has
suggested
at
this
joint
board,
that
it
can
resolve
many
of
the
these
--
these
disputes
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
the
dunlop
order,
they
called
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
i'm
not
so
sure
whether
to
either
the
unions
or
employers
who
would
be
willing
to
have
the
board
resolve
these
disputes
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
have
any,
your
honor
but
here's
what
i
do
have
on
the
legislative
history.
the
1947
house
bill
contained
a
provision
which
prohibited
jurisdictional
disputes
--
jurisdictional
strikes
over
assignment
of
works
--
of
work.
it
did
not
contain
any
provision
comparable
to
the
section
10
(k)
provision.
the
senate
bill
--
the
senate
bill
did
contain
a
section
10
(k)
provision
which
had
been
proposed
by
senator
morse
but
that
differs
however
from
the
present
provision
of
the
bill
in
that
--
in
that
section
10
(k)
as
passed
by
the
senate,
required
the
board
or
an
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute.
and
senator
morse
said
that
this
made
for
compulsory
arbitration
of
these
jurisdictional
disputes.
now,
when
the
thing
went
to
conference
--
when
the
--
when
this
bill
went
to
conference,
the
conference
deleted
--
deleted
from
the
senate
bill,
the
provision
empowering
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
determine
these
disputes.
the
conference
bill
came
back
to
the
senate
and
senator
morse
complained
of
the
deletion
saying
that
the
--
the
result
of
the
deletion
would
be
to
put
the
board
into
the
arbitration
business,
a
kind
of
business
for
--
to
which
the
board
had
no
special
competence
and
for
which
these
procedures
were
ill-suited.
now,
it
is
significant
to
know
that
after
the
conference
bill
was
reported
out
and
after
senator
morse
had
made
these
objections,
the
amendment
of
--
to
carving
out
his
--
his
suggestions
that
none
of
the
proponents
of
the
conference
bill
shared
the
view
of
senator
mores
that
this
would
put
the
board
into
the
arbitration
business.
now,
i
think
from
this
legislative
history,
you
can
draw
two
inferences.
the
court
undoubtedly
will
make
its
own
appraisal
of
the
--
of
the
legislative
history
but
as
we
see
it,
the
legislative
history
either
means
that
the
board
was
put
into
the
arbitration
business
or
--
or
that
congress,
realizing
the
impact
of
putting
the
board
into
this
form
of
compulsory
arbitration,
realizing
the
impact
of
that
sort
of
thing
upon
section
303,
upon
the
provisions
prohibiting
discriminations
by
reason
of
union
membership,
realizing
those
things
shied
away,
shied
away
from
this
compulsory
arbitration
and
left
the
board
to
move
in
an
area
in
which
it
had
some
familiarity
in
which
it
had
some
competence,
namely
whether
the
assignment
was
in
derogation
of
a
bargaining
cert
--
of
a
certificate
or
order
within
the
meeting
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
arbitration.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
--
he
was
opposed
to
having
that
part
of
this
original
amendment
deleted,
a
part
which
empowered
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
morse
--
the
morse
bill
said
or
the
morse
amendment
rather
which
the
senate
passed
said,
"either
the
board
or
an
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board
will
determine
these
disputes.
in
the
conference,
the
part
about
or
appointing
an
arbitrator
was
knocked
out
and
he
complained
about
it
that
it
would
put
the
board
--
that
the
result
would
be
to
put
the
board
in
this
unfamiliar
area
of
arbitrating
disputes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
senator
morse
was
the
only
one
who
said
that
and
as
i
say
none
of
the
proponents
of
the
conference
bill
agreed
at
least
vocally
in
congress,
agreed
that
this
was
the
interpretation
to
be
put
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
nothing
said
about
this.
they
just
made
this
--
this
deletion.
the
conference
--
the
conference
report
says
"we
have
adopted
the
senate"
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what
was
said
on
it
that
these
matters
would
be
arbitrated
by
the
board
or
an
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board.
that's
what
--
that
was
the
proposal.
senator
morse
said
that
it
was
a
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
and
it
would
be
done,
either
by
the
board
or
by
an
arbitrator
appointed,
presumably,
the
board
and
invert
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
appoint
the
arbitrator.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
for
this
reason
that
one
can
no
longer
be
sure
that
that's
what
the
conference
committee
intended
because
in
conference
--
in
conference
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
is
--
the
--
the
house
bill
had
a
broad
provision
prohibiting
all
jurisdictional
dispute
strikes.
it
had
no
section
10
(k).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
reason,
the
only
thing
like
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
have
nothing
else
--
nothing
else
but
i
do
want
to
call
your
attention
to
this.
that
as
i
say,
we
think
that
the
more
plausible
inference
is
that
congress
shied
away
from
this
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
because
senator
taft
--
senator
taft
gave
assurances
--
gave
assurances
that
section
10
(k)
and
8
(b)
4
(d)
were
not
to
afford
avenues
of
escape
to
either
employers
or
to
unions
from
the
restrictions
of
the
statute
against
discrimination
and
employment.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
if
there
are
any
comments
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
was
but
he
made
--
i
don't
know
of
any
comment
other
than
this.
there
were
suggestions
that
as
the
bill
came
out
of
conference,
it
was
suggested
that
it
would
permit
the
employer
--
it
would
permit
the
employer
by
giving
work
to
unorganized
class
or
groups.
it
would
permit
the
employer
to
under
mind
--
undermine
the
unions.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
in
his
answer
to
that
--
in
his
answer
to
that,
he
said
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
10
(k)
were
not
to
afford
an
escape
from
the
restrictions
against
discrimination.
and
we
say
your
honor,
if
i
may
finish
it,
we
say
that
if
the
board
is
required
to
arbitrate
these
disputes
in
10
(k)
on
the
basis
of
tradition,
custom
or
practice,
the
effect
would
be
to
afford
the
unions
and
the
employers
an
escape
from
the
--
these
restrictions
against
--
against
discrimination.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
there
is
senator
ellender
had
made
some
remarks
along
those
lines
but
this
was
before
conference,
before
conference,
before
there
was
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
agreed
--
he
agreed
with
senator
--
senator
morse
that
the
bill
as
passed
by
the
senate
would
provide
for
a
form
of
compulsory
arbitration.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
was
for
it.
he
was
for
it
but
when
it
came
out
of
conference
--
when
it
came
out
of
conference
as
i
say,
senator
morse
was
the
only
one
who
--
who
was
complaining
about
the
deletion
of
the
arbitrator
and
attributed
to
the
bill
as
it
came
out
of
conference
of
--
the
board
in
the
arbitration
business.
there
are
two
loose
things,
if
i
may
wind
them
up,
your
honor
and
one
is
an
answer
to
senator
--
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
in
1949,
when
there
were
hearings
before
--
when
the
thomas
bill
was
passed
by
the
senate
which
as
i
say
would
have
overruled
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
10
(k).
i
wanted
to
make
clear
that
by
the
time
that
bill
was
passed
by
the
senate
and
that
died
in
the
house
committee,
the
board
had
already
issued
its
three
initial
decisions
in
this
area.
so
if
the
board's
position
was
well
known
in
1949
when
congress
--
when
the
senate
passed
the
thomas
bill
which
was
--
i
say
if
it
had
passed
that,
the
house
would
have
overruled
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
10
(k)
and
--
what
--
my
time
is
up.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
arose
for
the
lunch
and
recess,
i
was
attempting
to
set
forth
some
of
the
incongruities
which
we
think
that
the
decision
below
gives
rise
to
--
particularly
in
connection
with
section
303
of
the
labor
management
relations
act.
that
section
as
i
explained
gives
a
right
to
anyone
who
has
been
injured
in
his
business
by
one
of
these
jurisdictional
dispute
strikes,
the
right
to
bring
a
suit
for
damages.
that
section
does
not
create
a
different
right
than
is
created
in
section
8
(b)
4
(d)
or
a
different
offense
and
is
created
in
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
but
adds
the
sanctions
of
a
cease
and
desist
order,
the
sanctions
of
damages.
and
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
juneau
spruce
case
decided
some
six
or
seven
years
ago,
this
court
made
clear
in
that
case,
the
elements
of
the
offence
under
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
303
are
the
same
and
that
prosecution
for
damages
under
303
is
in
no
way
dependent
upon
an
antecedent
for
determination
under
section
10
(k).
under
section
303,
as
under
section
8
(b)
4
(d),
a
claim
to
a
disputed
work
based
upon
tradition,
custom
or
what
have
you
is
irrelevant.
now,
we
believe
that
if
the
--
that
if
the
offense
in
--
under
section
303
is
established
as
the
statute
says
is
established
by
showing
that
the
employer's
--
by
showing
that
the
employer's
assignment
is
not
in
derogation
of
a
board
certificate
or
order
within
the
meaning
of
8
(b)
4
(d),
then
tradition
and
practice
are
irrelevant
to
a
section
303
action
and
if
they
are
irrelevant
to
a
section
303
action,
we
believe
that
they
are
also
irrelevant
under
8
(b)
4
(d)
as
well
as
section
10
(k)
because
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right,
that's
right.
due
--
there
had
been
a
situation
where
the
board
has
found
an
8
(b)
4
(d)
violation
or
rather
no
violation
of
8
(b)
4
(d)
but
a
district
court
has.
but
the
court
of
--
the
--
this
court
made
clear
in
the
juneau
spruce
case
however,
that
a
section
303
action
is
not
dependent
upon
a
prior
board
determination
in
a
section
10
(k)
hearing.
now,
if
tradition
and
custom
are
irrelevant
to
a
303
action,
as
i
say,
we
think
they
are
also
irrelevant
under
the
provisions
of
the
statute
that
the
board
administers
because
if
it
were
not
so
--
if
it
were
not
so,
you
would
have
the
rather
startling
result
that
a
strike
could
be
illegal
under
303
for
purposes
of
awarding
damages
and
yet
lawful
under
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
statute.
decisions
below
leads
not
only
to
this
incongruity
but
it
also
cuts
across,
we
think
--
it
also
cuts
across
of
what
--
one
of
the
most
basic
policies
of
the
statute,
namely
the
policy
against
discrimination
in
employment
which
encourages
or
discourages
union
membership.
under
the
statute,
an
employer
has
the
inherent
right
to
select
his
employees
and
make
his
work
assignments.
the
principle
restriction
which
a
statue
imposes
upon
the
exercise
of
that
right
is
that
it
shall
not
be
exercised
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
so
as
to
encourage
or
discourage
union
membership.
but
the
ruling
below
which
would
require
the
board
to
award
--
award
work
affirmatively
to
the
members
of
one
union
or
another
under
the
basis
of
tradition,
custom
and
the
like,
would
foster
through
the
section
10
(k)
proceedings
a
circumvention
of
this
policy
against
discrimination.
now,
let
me
illustrate.
suppose
that
you
had
an
employer
whose
employees
are
presently
members
of
or
represented
by
union
a
and
that
that
employer
has
obtained
a
job.
union
b
claiming
that
its
members
are
entitled
to
this
kind
of
work
puts
pressure
upon
him
to
give
its
members
to
--
or
puts
pressure
upon
the
employer
to
give
the
work
to
his
members.
now,
the
employer
can
either
discharge
his
employees
and
--
and
replace
them
with
members
of
union
b
or
it
can
give
up
the
job
altogether.
in
either
case,
there
is
discrimination
against
his
employers
by
reason
of
their
non-membership
in
union
b.
let
me
cite
one
more
example.
often,
the
jurisdictional
disputes
pit
a
union
against
an
--
an
unorganized
group
of
employees.
if
tradition
or
custom
were
to
be
controlling
in
a
situation
like
that,
the
chances
are
that
in
--
in
most
cases,
the
union
would
probably
prevail
as
against
the
unorganized
group
because
the
union
undoubtedly
couldn't
make
a
better
showing
of
tradition
or
custom
or
practice
in
support
of
its
claim
than
could
the
unorganized
group.
again,
you
would
have
encouragement
of
the
unorganized
group
to
join
the
union
which
obtained
the
--
the
work
by
virtue
of
its
claims
based
upon
tradition
or
custom
or
practice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
unanimity
among
all
the
members
of
congress
who
passed
this
statute
that
jurisdictional
disputes
were
bad
and
they
were
against
that
just
as
they
were
against
sin
but
there
was
quite
--
they
were
divided
as
to
how
to
reach
heaven
one
might
say
in
how
to
settle
these
disputes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
your
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
as
i
--
i
shall
--
as
i
shall
explain
in
a
moment
i'm
getting
to
it.
when
we
come
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
you
will
see
that
while
there
was
--
some
of
the
legislators
hope
that
this
would
give
the
board
the
power
to
arbitrate
these
disputes
and
settle
them
once
and
for
all
that
after
the
conference
committee
got
through
with
the
bills
and
that
i
will
explain
this
shortly.
after
we've
--
conference
committee
got
through
with
the
bills,
there
was
very
little
left
to
that
at
least
as
we
read
the
legislative
history.
that
all
that
was
left
as
we
see
it,
all
was
left
to
the
board
was
simply
to
determine
a
section
10
(k)
hearing,
whether
or
not
he
employer's
assignment
was
in
derogation
--
was
in
derogation
of
a
certificate
or
a
--
or
an
order
of
the
board
which
had
been
issued
in
a
representation
or
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
justice
black
however,
suggested
that
if
the
congress
meant
to
have
the
board
settle
that
--
and
i'm
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
as
i
say,
there
was
unanimity
on
the
part
of
congress
that
these
were
bad
things
but
they
--
they
didn't
perhaps
choose
an
adequate
method
for
resolving
the
basic
underlying
disputes,
though
the
statute
does
not
afford
that
kind
of
solution
to
this
problem.
now
it
maybe
that
this
are
the
kind
of
a
problem
that
congress
left
to
take
a
look
again
and
a
--
take
a
look
into,
but
as
we
read
this
statute
it
does
not
permit
the
board
to
resolve
the
underlying
jurisdictional
dispute
between
the
no
rights
of
the
carpenters.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
arguments
have
been
going
out
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
all
in
their
--
their
long
standing
disputes
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
turning
to
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
professor
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
that's
been
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
the
--
whether
he
really
would
want
to.
however
though,
professor
cox
has
suggested
at
this
joint
board,
that
it
can
resolve
many
of
the
these
--
these
disputes
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
the
dunlop
order,
they
called
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
pardon
me?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
i'm
not
so
sure
whether
to
either
the
unions
or
employers
who
would
be
willing
to
have
the
board
resolve
these
disputes
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
have
any,
your
honor
but
here's
what
i
do
have
on
the
legislative
history.
the
1947
house
bill
contained
a
provision
which
prohibited
jurisdictional
disputes
--
jurisdictional
strikes
over
assignment
of
works
--
of
work.
it
did
not
contain
any
provision
comparable
to
the
section
10
(k)
provision.
the
senate
bill
--
the
senate
bill
did
contain
a
section
10
(k)
provision
which
had
been
proposed
by
senator
morse
but
that
differs
however
from
the
present
provision
of
the
bill
in
that
--
in
that
section
10
(k)
as
passed
by
the
senate,
required
the
board
or
an
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute.
and
senator
morse
said
that
this
made
for
compulsory
arbitration
of
these
jurisdictional
disputes.
now,
when
the
thing
went
to
conference
--
when
the
--
when
this
bill
went
to
conference,
the
conference
deleted
--
deleted
from
the
senate
bill,
the
provision
empowering
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
determine
these
disputes.
the
conference
bill
came
back
to
the
senate
and
senator
morse
complained
of
the
deletion
saying
that
the
--
the
result
of
the
deletion
would
be
to
put
the
board
into
the
arbitration
business,
a
kind
of
business
for
--
to
which
the
board
had
no
special
competence
and
for
which
these
procedures
were
ill-suited.
now,
it
is
significant
to
know
that
after
the
conference
bill
was
reported
out
and
after
senator
morse
had
made
these
objections,
the
amendment
of
--
to
carving
out
his
--
his
suggestions
that
none
of
the
proponents
of
the
conference
bill
shared
the
view
of
senator
mores
that
this
would
put
the
board
into
the
arbitration
business.
now,
i
think
from
this
legislative
history,
you
can
draw
two
inferences.
the
court
undoubtedly
will
make
its
own
appraisal
of
the
--
of
the
legislative
history
but
as
we
see
it,
the
legislative
history
either
means
that
the
board
was
put
into
the
arbitration
business
or
--
or
that
congress,
realizing
the
impact
of
putting
the
board
into
this
form
of
compulsory
arbitration,
realizing
the
impact
of
that
sort
of
thing
upon
section
303,
upon
the
provisions
prohibiting
discriminations
by
reason
of
union
membership,
realizing
those
things
shied
away,
shied
away
from
this
compulsory
arbitration
and
left
the
board
to
move
in
an
area
in
which
it
had
some
familiarity
in
which
it
had
some
competence,
namely
whether
the
assignment
was
in
derogation
of
a
bargaining
cert
--
of
a
certificate
or
order
within
the
meeting
of
the
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
arbitration.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
--
he
was
opposed
to
having
that
part
of
this
original
amendment
deleted,
a
part
which
empowered
the
board
to
appoint
an
arbitrator.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
morse
--
the
morse
bill
said
or
the
morse
amendment
rather
which
the
senate
passed
said,
"either
the
board
or
an
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board
will
determine
these
disputes.
in
the
conference,
the
part
about
or
appointing
an
arbitrator
was
knocked
out
and
he
complained
about
it
that
it
would
put
the
board
--
that
the
result
would
be
to
put
the
board
in
this
unfamiliar
area
of
arbitrating
disputes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
your
honor,
senator
morse
was
the
only
one
who
said
that
and
as
i
say
none
of
the
proponents
of
the
conference
bill
agreed
at
least
vocally
in
congress,
agreed
that
this
was
the
interpretation
to
be
put
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
nothing
said
about
this.
they
just
made
this
--
this
deletion.
the
conference
--
the
conference
report
says
"we
have
adopted
the
senate"
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what
was
said
on
it
that
these
matters
would
be
arbitrated
by
the
board
or
an
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board.
that's
what
--
that
was
the
proposal.
senator
morse
said
that
it
was
a
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
and
it
would
be
done,
either
by
the
board
or
by
an
arbitrator
appointed,
presumably,
the
board
and
invert
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
appoint
the
arbitrator.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
for
this
reason
that
one
can
no
longer
be
sure
that
that's
what
the
conference
committee
intended
because
in
conference
--
in
conference
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
is
--
the
--
the
house
bill
had
a
broad
provision
prohibiting
all
jurisdictional
dispute
strikes.
it
had
no
section
10
(k).
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
reason,
the
only
thing
like
it.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
have
nothing
else
--
nothing
else
but
i
do
want
to
call
your
attention
to
this.
that
as
i
say,
we
think
that
the
more
plausible
inference
is
that
congress
shied
away
from
this
form
of
compulsory
arbitration
because
senator
taft
--
senator
taft
gave
assurances
--
gave
assurances
that
section
10
(k)
and
8
(b)
4
(d)
were
not
to
afford
avenues
of
escape
to
either
employers
or
to
unions
from
the
restrictions
of
the
statute
against
discrimination
and
employment.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
of
any
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
if
there
are
any
comments
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
it
was
but
he
made
--
i
don't
know
of
any
comment
other
than
this.
there
were
suggestions
that
as
the
bill
came
out
of
conference,
it
was
suggested
that
it
would
permit
the
employer
--
it
would
permit
the
employer
by
giving
work
to
unorganized
class
or
groups.
it
would
permit
the
employer
to
under
mind
--
undermine
the
unions.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
in
his
answer
to
that
--
in
his
answer
to
that,
he
said
that
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
and
10
(k)
were
not
to
afford
an
escape
from
the
restrictions
against
discrimination.
and
we
say
your
honor,
if
i
may
finish
it,
we
say
that
if
the
board
is
required
to
arbitrate
these
disputes
in
10
(k)
on
the
basis
of
tradition,
custom
or
practice,
the
effect
would
be
to
afford
the
unions
and
the
employers
an
escape
from
the
--
these
restrictions
against
--
against
discrimination.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
there
is
senator
ellender
had
made
some
remarks
along
those
lines
but
this
was
before
conference,
before
conference,
before
there
was
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
agreed
--
he
agreed
with
senator
--
senator
morse
that
the
bill
as
passed
by
the
senate
would
provide
for
a
form
of
compulsory
arbitration.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
was
for
it.
he
was
for
it
but
when
it
came
out
of
conference
--
when
it
came
out
of
conference
as
i
say,
senator
morse
was
the
only
one
who
--
who
was
complaining
about
the
deletion
of
the
arbitrator
and
attributed
to
the
bill
as
it
came
out
of
conference
of
--
the
board
in
the
arbitration
business.
there
are
two
loose
things,
if
i
may
wind
them
up,
your
honor
and
one
is
an
answer
to
senator
--
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
in
1949,
when
there
were
hearings
before
--
when
the
thomas
bill
was
passed
by
the
senate
which
as
i
say
would
have
overruled
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
10
(k).
i
wanted
to
make
clear
that
by
the
time
that
bill
was
passed
by
the
senate
and
that
died
in
the
house
committee,
the
board
had
already
issued
its
three
initial
decisions
in
this
area.
so
if
the
board's
position
was
well
known
in
1949
when
congress
--
when
the
senate
passed
the
thomas
bill
which
was
--
i
say
if
it
had
passed
that,
the
house
would
have
overruled
the
board's
interpretation
of
section
10
(k)
and
--
what
--
my
time
is
up.
