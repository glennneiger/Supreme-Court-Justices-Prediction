mr.
louis
sherman
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
touch
on
a
few
small
items
that
became
involved
earlier;
first,
the
matter
of
terminologies.
i
think
the
word
dispute
has
to
be
contrasted
with
the
words
unfair
labor
practice.
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
i
refer
to
page
6
(a)
of
our
brief
and
i'll
skip
over
to
duplicating
words
engage
in
a
strike
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
to
assign
particular
work
to
employees
in
a
particular
labor
organization
or
in
a
particular
trade,
craft
or
class
rather
than
the
employees
in
the
labor
organization
trade.
that
is
the
unfair
labor
practice.
then
there
is
the
dispute
which
is
referred
to
in
section
10
(k)
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen.
now
it
is
our
feeling,
is
that
in
this
case,
the
act
of
the
local
union
of
the
ibw
in
resisting
the
employer's
assignment
would
come,
if
it
all,
under
the
unfair
labor
practice
section
and
that
the
word
dispute
is
a
dispute
between
the
ibw
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ia
on
the
other,
the
international
--
mr.
louis
sherman
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
it
will
be
recalled
that
in
the
process
of
passing
this
bill
--
to
begin
with,
labor
did
not
appear
at
the
hearings.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
testimony
by
any
of
the
leaders
of
the
labor
organizations.
as
i
recall
it,
they
took
their
hands
off
added
to
the
respect
to
this
matter.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
evidence,
however,
with
respect
to
the
controversy
between
--
i
believe
it
was
the
carpenters
and
laborers
in
new
jersey
where
a
very
large
scale
jurisdictional
dispute
was
then
going
on.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
employers
were
coming
to
watch
them
at
that
time
with
a
cry
to
somebody
or
to
settle
this
and
there
was
nobody
to
settle
it
and
there
was
of
course
a
complete
stoppage
of
work.
now,
then
that
is
dispute
we
think
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that.
we
think
the
employer
would
have
a
part
in
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
if
he
chose
to
do
so.
we
believe
that
the
only
jurisdictional
dispute
there
can
be
is
the
dispute
involving
the
jurisdiction
of
unions,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
as
between
the
employer
and
the
--
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
you
honor.
we
do
not
say
that.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
this
of
course
is
exactly
the
same
thing
we
have
today
under
the
joint
board.
we
have
job
decisions
as
distinguished
from
national
decisions.
conceive
the
situation
where
there
might
have
been
a
national
decision
under
the
joint
board,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes.
but
i'm
trying
to
explain
that
even
in
connection
with
disputes
of
that
sort,
there
is
this
distinct
new
job
decisions
and
national
decisions
and
i
may
say
there
are
no
national
decisions,
there
are
job
decisions.
from
a
practical
point
of
view
presumably
this
would
happen
here
too.
now,
actually,
going
back
again
for
a
moment
to
legislative
history,
it
is
true
that
we're
talking
about
minority
views
but
there's
also
a
fact
that
in
this
particular
part
of
the
legislation
and
i
think
it
is
somewhat
unsophisticated
to
talk
about
majority
and
minority,
when
the
congress
came
in
that
session,
there
had
been,
as
you
may
recall,
the
adoption
of
the
case,
bill
and
veto
thereof
and
a
great
wave
of
public
opinion,
we
have
to
face
that
now.
and
the
president
of
the
unite
states,
mr.
truman,
in
his
message
does
not
say,
"no
labor
legislation."
he
said,
"yes"
at
some
labor
legislation.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
he
proposed
was
that
legislation
be
enacted
with
respect
to
this
problem
of
jurisdictional
disputes.
so
therefore,
it
is
no
accident.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
not
too
specific.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
--
mr.
louis
sherman
you
honor,
i
was
only
referring
to
testimony
of
the
court.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
think
that
in
this
one
area,
there
had
been
an
acceptance
on
the
part
of
the
president
and
on
the
part
of
the
senators
in
the
committee
who
were
favorable
to
labor
of
a
necessity
for
doing
something.
mr.
louis
sherman
because
they
were
satisfied,
i
believe,
with
the
majority's
action.
mr.
louis
sherman
in
generality.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
think
your
honor
will
find
however
that
in
this
regard,
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
jurisdictional
disputes,
they
were
faced,
however,
with
a
different
problem.
mr.
louis
sherman
there
was
--
mr.
louis
sherman
no
you
will
not
because
the
majority
report
stated
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
have
happened
because
the
majority
committee
report
s.1126
as
reported,
contained
the
very
provisions
that
we're
talking
about.
in
other
words,
arbitrators
--
and
to
hear
and
determine
dispute
power
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
when
it
was
passed
by
the
senate,
it
contained
those
very
same
provisions.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
issue
is
whether
the
deletion
of
the
authority
to
appoint
arbitrators
cut
the
heart
out
of
it
in
substance
and
changed
the
entire
picture
of
10
(k)
or
whether
on
the
contrary,
all
it
meant
was
that
an
agency
for
decisions,
that
is
arbitrators
appointed
by
the
board,
would
not
be
available
and
the
board
would
continue
with
the
task
which
formerly
would
have
been
done
at
the
option
of
the
board,
either
by
the
board
or
by
the
arbitrators
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
and
not
because
--
mr.
louis
sherman
this
of
course
is
exactly
what
was
said
contemporaneously
by
senator
morse.
in
other
words,
he
thought
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
that
--
senator
morse
and
he
is
important
in
this
because
it
was
his
original
bill,
s.858,
which
put
in
these
provisions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
10
(k)
was
written
by
him
as
6
(k)
of
his
bill.
it
must
be
remembered
also,
i
believe,
that
the
really
rubbed
attitude
on
the
jurisdictional
dispute
or
strike
came
from
the
house
side,
where
they
would
have
put
down
a
complete
ban
against
jurisdictional
strikes
or
stoppages
for
any
reasons.
in
other
words,
this
process
of
voluntary
agreement
that
people
getting
together
and
so
forth
would
have
no
meaning
because
if
any
union,
whether
it
would
be
in
the
no
rights
of
carpenters
situation
that
you
put,
would
strike
then
that
in
itself
would
be
illegal.
but
if
we
turn
to
the
language
of
the
bill
as
adopted
by
the
senate,
it
says,
"the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen,"
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
and
to
determine
such
as
disputes,
the
same
language,
hear
and
determine
the
dispute."
one
case,
the
board
can
do
it
and
also
appoint
arbitrators
and
in
the
final
version
the
arbitrators
are
out
and
the
board
has
this
unwelcome
job
which
it
has
been
--
mr.
louis
sherman
and
this
of
course
was
the
complaint
which
was
that
before
it
could
make
the
determinations
rather
than
having
the
option
of
using
arbitration
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
for
that
purpose.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct
but
it
would
not
be
done
by
an
arbitrator.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say,
i
think
that
the
veto
message
was
merely
drawing
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
available
method
for
disposing
of
the
dispute
which
they
thought
superior
and
one
of
the
main
reasons
was
a
time
factor,
and
that's
spread
out
in
the
language
by
senator
morse,
would
not
be
available.
but
the
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
as
far
as
the
board's
construction
is
concerned
in
the
main
it
goes
to
the
point
that
whatever
the
employer
assigns
is
the
answer
because
if
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
i
went
through
the
record
and
there's
some
very
interesting
comments
about
that
from
the
employer
involved,
a
mr.
fitz
of
cbs,
where
he
says
that,
"having
these
conflicting
claims,
he
was
in
no
position
to
make
the
decision"
and
i
don't
think
he
was
talking
just
intellectually
or
academically.
at
one
point
here,
the
trial
examiner
who
served
the
case
said,
"mr.
fitz
testified
very
clearly
that
is
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
and
trying
to
satisfy
both
of
them.
so
that
--
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
typical
situation
they
were
talking
about
was
an
employer
who
wasn't
breaking
his
neck,
shall
we
say,
in
making
decisions
between
powerful
unions
as
we're
talking
to
no
rights
case.
and
yet
the
dispute
--
now,
as
we
see
it
from
the
legislative
history
and
we
think
it's
born
out
by
it.
what
congress
intended
was
to
set
up
a
procedure
under
which
if
the
thing
was
serious
enough
to
warrant
a
strike,
that
there
would
be
some
way
of
settling
not
the
unfair
labor
practice.
that
would
be
of
adjudicated
in
accordance
with
regular
procedures,
but
the
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
arose.
in
this
case,
the
controversy
whether
the
ia
union
or
the
ip
union
should
have
the
work
referred
to
the
people
that
were
in
it's
bargaining
unit
or
under
its
contract
and
although
that
may
seem
to
be
a
frightening
thought
there
is
an
answer
to
it
as
developed
in
the
building
trades.
there's
nothing
to
stop
the
establishment
of
a
voluntary
body
for
settling
those
disputes.
mr.
louis
sherman
no
your
honor,
but
frankly
and
clearly,
what
the
congress
did
here
did
help
to
place
impetus
behind
the
establishment
of
a
voluntary
body
and
there
were
two
reasons
for
it.
one
was
the
language
of
the
act
and
the
other
was
this
very
thing
that's
been
mentioned
which
is
a
desire
of
the
parties,
particularly
in
the
building
trades
not
to
have
their
disputes
settled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
that
does
mean
that
because
they
desire
it
both
management
and
the
labor,
let
us
say,
that
that
changes
the
statutory
provisions
of
the
act
or
the
legislative
history
thereof.
there
were
two
things
they
didn't
want
to
have
happened.
now,
actually
there's
one
aspect
of
it
if
i
may
say
in
connection
with
this
joint
board
and
which
is
spread
in
our
brief.
that
their
problem
today
is
what
to
do
about
the
employer
who
decides
to
take
advantage
of
the
board
rule
and
what
is
the
board
rule?
board
rule
is
that
if
the
employer
assigns
the
work
then
we'll
have
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
is
an
order
of
certification
which
let's
say
in
this
industry
there
is
none,
but
they
don't
have
certifications.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
an
employer
does
not
have
the
incentive
to
become
a
part
of
this
voluntary
arrangement
because
he
can
by
assigning,
get
the
full
support
of
the
federal
government
to
restrain
any
conduct
in
violation
of
that
assignment.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
play
on
that
basis
for
the
development
of
a
voluntary
solution
of
the
problem.
and
as
i
say,
we
set
that
forth
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
which
is
the
position
of
the
joint
board.
we
assumed,
talking
about
these
policy
considerations,
that
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
recognized
to
have
this
function
but
then,
either
one
or
two
things
would
happen.
the
employers
will
now
--
do
not
wish
to
bind
themselves,
the
joint
board
procedure
would
do
so
or
if
they
didn't,
there
would
be
a
proceeding
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
joint
board
plan
just
to
see
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
they
think
they
have
the
--
every
reason
in
the
world.
in
other
words,
the
parties
would
rather
have
their
affair
settled
by
the
industry
than
they
would,
the
(inaudible)
mr.
louis
sherman
yes.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
they
wouldn't
be
doing
to
provoke
the
dispute.
what
we're
saying
that
since
they
have,
under
the
board
rule,
a
naked
power
to
assign
whichever
way
they
assign,
however
arbitrarily,
however
capriciously
and
then
get
the
support
of
the
federal
government
to
suppress
the
labor
activity
that
may
result
from
that
assignment
that
that
can
be
a
better
position
from
their
point
of
view
in
submitting
to
either
the
joint
board
or
submitting
to
the
--
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
will
try
to
answer
that
right
now.
certainly,
if
this
hearing
were
being
held
at
the
beginning
of
the
administration
of
the
wagner
act,
it
will
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
answer
that
question
in
terms
of,
shall
we
say,
how
are
all
the
appropriate
unit
questions
are
going
to
come
up
in
the
multiplicity
of
american
industry
going
to
be
decided,
particularly
since
those
issues
were
new
issues
as
distinguished
from
jurisdictional
dispute
matters
which
have
been
decided
and
which
exists
the
very
real
things
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
there
has
been
no
governmental
action
of
this
sort.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
and
i
think
the
standards
that
would
apply,
i
would
certainly
hesitate
to
define
each
and
every
one
of
them
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
could
be
developed
a
series
of
sensible
approaches
to
that
problem
just
as
we
did
with
the
unit
questions
under
the
act,
but
it
would
not
just
be
custom
and
practice
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
your
honor
because
actually
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i
think
they
are
very
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
they
are
very
different
in
legal
--
in
legal
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
agree
with
their
complete
--
they're
different
questions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
board
here
argues
its
position
with
respect
to
certifications
and
it
rules
that
a
certification
of
a
bargaining
unit
has
nothing
to
do
with
work
tasks.
that's
in
the
plumber's
case
and
in
general
analog.
they
are
different
but
they
are
the
same
in
this
sense
only,
your
honor
that
there
will
have
to
be
some
work
done
with
respect
to
development
of
appropriate
standards.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
that
work
will
be
much
easier
in
this
field.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
consequences.
the
work
will
be
easier
in
this
field
because
they
have
something
to
work
on.
your
honor,
permit
me,
we've
had
--
this
reference
made
the
national
labor
board
and
i've
gone
back
to
those
decisions.
the
new
york
telephone
company
case,
other
cases,
those
were
straight
out
jurisdictional
disputes
which
during
the
war,
were
handled
on
the
basis
of
an
arbitration
and
this
was
certainly
in
senator
morse's
mind
when
he
was
the
one
who
advanced
the
idea.
it
did
not
come
from
mr.
hartley,
did
not
come
from
mr.
taft.
it
came
from
senator
morse
and
it
was,
i
think,
pursuant
to
the
presidential
action
in
his
message.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i
suppose
that
is
--
that
is
--
that's
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well
it's
a
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
if
--
mr.
louis
sherman
if
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well
--
well,
i'm
saying
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
borrow
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
that's
what
he
had
in
mind
when
he
made
his
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
would
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
must
respectfully
differ
your
honor
because
you
will
find,
if
you
compare
the
language
of
section
6
(k)
of
s.858
which
is
his
bill,
with
10
(k)
which
is
the
act
that
you
will
find
omitted
only
the
optional
authority
to
appoint
arbitrators.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
it
has
become
a
specialist
to
great
many,
your
honor.
i
don't
question
that.
mr.
louis
sherman
the
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
and
there
wasn't
a
person,
your
honor
who
stood
up
and
said
that
the
effect
of
this
was
anything
other
than
the
elimination
of
this
option
to
appoint
an
arbitrator.
mr.
louis
sherman
to
do
that
which
is
to
argue
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
sherman
the
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
it
would
be
a
government
arbitrator.
that's
right.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
the
language
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
actually,
the
conflict
came
between
the
house
bill
on
the
one
hand
which
was
intended
and
--
and
in
this
regard,
it
was
different
from
the
war,
a
restrictive
legal
prohibition
against
any
form
of
jurisdictional
strike
is
quite
no
matter
what
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
don't
think
he
had
anything
and
i
think
this
was
added
by
senator
morse
prior
to
the
bill
--
let
me
get
straight.
senator
morse's
bill
came
in,
in
march.
the
bill
was
reported.
the
taft
bill
was
reported
in
april
and
the
taft
bill
as
reported
contained
the
language
which
is
pretty
close
to
what
we
have
now
and
it
contained
specifically
the
item
on
arbitrators.
well
as
you
first
have
the
morse's
bill
in
march
of
1947
then
you
have
the
taft
bill
as
reported
by
the
committee.
i'm
not
sure
about
what
bill
he
made
for
this.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
louis
sherman
no.
i'm
sure
he
didn't
have
(inaudible)
anything
in
here
until
morses
came
forward
with
the
proper
issue.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
if
your
honor
please,
we
look
at
the
language.
the
board
--
and
this
is
10
(k)
that
the
bill
has
--
and
as
passed.
"the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
and
determine
such
dispute
unless
within
10
days
and
so
forth
upon
compliance
by
the
parties
to
dispute
with
the
decision
of
the
board,
or
the
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board."
now
then,
we've
got
to
find
a
dichotomy
here
where
we're
talking
about
the
decision
of
the
board
meaning
one
thing
and
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
meaning
another
thing
and
the
very
sentence
which
gives
them
exactly
the
same
effect.
if
i
may
suggest
your
honor,
leaves
me
simpler
to
say
that
all
that
happened
here
was
--
they
decided
for
good
or
for
bad,
but
instead
of
having
these
matters
decided
by
arbitrators
at
the
option
of
the
board,
they
want
to
put
the
whole
job
in
the
hands
of
the
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
of
course
we
have
contemporaneous
--
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
sherman
your
honor,
it
wasn't
very
different
as
far
as
i
can
see,
just
took
out
the
words
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
even
--
even
arbitrator
is
merely
described.
in
other
words,
it's
as
if
ad
hoc
individual
as
distinguished
in
the
five-man
board
more
an
arbitrator
if
you
will,
but
the
function
is
the
same
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
arose.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
because
i
do
think
that
the
congress
was
perhaps
a
little
more
far
seeing
than
the
board.
they
knew
about
these
disputes.
they're
tough
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
but
nevertheless,
just
as
they
believe,
people
can
refuse
to
settle
on
any
basis
that
strikes
to
recognition
would
be
lessened
if
there
were
certifications.
i
--
after
all,
the
certification
is
just
a
piece
of
paper
too,
but
people
tend
to
accept
these
things.
but
so
here
with
jurisdictional
disputes,
that
if
there
was
somebody
or
something
or
some
board,
which
would
actually
decide
the
jurisdictional
dispute
that
that
would
tend
to
reduce
the
dispute.
of
course
that's
what
we
found
on
the
joint
board,
that's
a
private
party
which
has
done
that.
the
problems
in
the
relationship
between
that
joint
board
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
i
say
covered.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
shows,
your
honor,
that
they
had
in
mind
this
very
thing
that
we're
talking
about
because
the
kind
of
dispute
they
were
going
to
settle
was
precisely
the
same
kind
of
dispute
they
thought
the
board
was
going
to
settle.
mr.
louis
sherman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
last
paragraph
on
this
--
mr.
louis
sherman
that's
--
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
add.
mr.
louis
sherman
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
touch
on
a
few
small
items
that
became
involved
earlier;
first,
the
matter
of
terminologies.
i
think
the
word
dispute
has
to
be
contrasted
with
the
words
unfair
labor
practice.
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
i
refer
to
page
6
(a)
of
our
brief
and
i'll
skip
over
to
duplicating
words
engage
in
a
strike
for
the
purpose
of
forcing
or
requiring
any
employer
to
assign
particular
work
to
employees
in
a
particular
labor
organization
or
in
a
particular
trade,
craft
or
class
rather
than
the
employees
in
the
labor
organization
trade.
that
is
the
unfair
labor
practice.
then
there
is
the
dispute
which
is
referred
to
in
section
10
(k)
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen.
now
it
is
our
feeling,
is
that
in
this
case,
the
act
of
the
local
union
of
the
ibw
in
resisting
the
employer's
assignment
would
come,
if
it
all,
under
the
unfair
labor
practice
section
and
that
the
word
dispute
is
a
dispute
between
the
ibw
on
the
one
hand
and
the
ia
on
the
other,
the
international
--
mr.
louis
sherman
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
it
will
be
recalled
that
in
the
process
of
passing
this
bill
--
to
begin
with,
labor
did
not
appear
at
the
hearings.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
testimony
by
any
of
the
leaders
of
the
labor
organizations.
as
i
recall
it,
they
took
their
hands
off
added
to
the
respect
to
this
matter.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
evidence,
however,
with
respect
to
the
controversy
between
--
i
believe
it
was
the
carpenters
and
laborers
in
new
jersey
where
a
very
large
scale
jurisdictional
dispute
was
then
going
on.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
employers
were
coming
to
watch
them
at
that
time
with
a
cry
to
somebody
or
to
settle
this
and
there
was
nobody
to
settle
it
and
there
was
of
course
a
complete
stoppage
of
work.
now,
then
that
is
dispute
we
think
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that.
we
think
the
employer
would
have
a
part
in
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
if
he
chose
to
do
so.
we
believe
that
the
only
jurisdictional
dispute
there
can
be
is
the
dispute
involving
the
jurisdiction
of
unions,
there
is
no
jurisdiction
as
between
the
employer
and
the
--
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
you
honor.
we
do
not
say
that.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
this
of
course
is
exactly
the
same
thing
we
have
today
under
the
joint
board.
we
have
job
decisions
as
distinguished
from
national
decisions.
conceive
the
situation
where
there
might
have
been
a
national
decision
under
the
joint
board,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes.
but
i'm
trying
to
explain
that
even
in
connection
with
disputes
of
that
sort,
there
is
this
distinct
new
job
decisions
and
national
decisions
and
i
may
say
there
are
no
national
decisions,
there
are
job
decisions.
from
a
practical
point
of
view
presumably
this
would
happen
here
too.
now,
actually,
going
back
again
for
a
moment
to
legislative
history,
it
is
true
that
we're
talking
about
minority
views
but
there's
also
a
fact
that
in
this
particular
part
of
the
legislation
and
i
think
it
is
somewhat
unsophisticated
to
talk
about
majority
and
minority,
when
the
congress
came
in
that
session,
there
had
been,
as
you
may
recall,
the
adoption
of
the
case,
bill
and
veto
thereof
and
a
great
wave
of
public
opinion,
we
have
to
face
that
now.
and
the
president
of
the
unite
states,
mr.
truman,
in
his
message
does
not
say,
"no
labor
legislation."
he
said,
"yes"
at
some
labor
legislation.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
he
proposed
was
that
legislation
be
enacted
with
respect
to
this
problem
of
jurisdictional
disputes.
so
therefore,
it
is
no
accident.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
not
too
specific.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
--
mr.
louis
sherman
you
honor,
i
was
only
referring
to
testimony
of
the
court.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
think
that
in
this
one
area,
there
had
been
an
acceptance
on
the
part
of
the
president
and
on
the
part
of
the
senators
in
the
committee
who
were
favorable
to
labor
of
a
necessity
for
doing
something.
mr.
louis
sherman
because
they
were
satisfied,
i
believe,
with
the
majority's
action.
mr.
louis
sherman
in
generality.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
think
your
honor
will
find
however
that
in
this
regard,
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
jurisdictional
disputes,
they
were
faced,
however,
with
a
different
problem.
mr.
louis
sherman
there
was
--
mr.
louis
sherman
no
you
will
not
because
the
majority
report
stated
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
have
happened
because
the
majority
committee
report
s.1126
as
reported,
contained
the
very
provisions
that
we're
talking
about.
in
other
words,
arbitrators
--
and
to
hear
and
determine
dispute
power
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
when
it
was
passed
by
the
senate,
it
contained
those
very
same
provisions.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
issue
is
whether
the
deletion
of
the
authority
to
appoint
arbitrators
cut
the
heart
out
of
it
in
substance
and
changed
the
entire
picture
of
10
(k)
or
whether
on
the
contrary,
all
it
meant
was
that
an
agency
for
decisions,
that
is
arbitrators
appointed
by
the
board,
would
not
be
available
and
the
board
would
continue
with
the
task
which
formerly
would
have
been
done
at
the
option
of
the
board,
either
by
the
board
or
by
the
arbitrators
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
and
not
because
--
mr.
louis
sherman
this
of
course
is
exactly
what
was
said
contemporaneously
by
senator
morse.
in
other
words,
he
thought
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
that
--
senator
morse
and
he
is
important
in
this
because
it
was
his
original
bill,
s.858,
which
put
in
these
provisions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
10
(k)
was
written
by
him
as
6
(k)
of
his
bill.
it
must
be
remembered
also,
i
believe,
that
the
really
rubbed
attitude
on
the
jurisdictional
dispute
or
strike
came
from
the
house
side,
where
they
would
have
put
down
a
complete
ban
against
jurisdictional
strikes
or
stoppages
for
any
reasons.
in
other
words,
this
process
of
voluntary
agreement
that
people
getting
together
and
so
forth
would
have
no
meaning
because
if
any
union,
whether
it
would
be
in
the
no
rights
of
carpenters
situation
that
you
put,
would
strike
then
that
in
itself
would
be
illegal.
but
if
we
turn
to
the
language
of
the
bill
as
adopted
by
the
senate,
it
says,
"the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen,"
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
and
to
determine
such
as
disputes,
the
same
language,
hear
and
determine
the
dispute."
one
case,
the
board
can
do
it
and
also
appoint
arbitrators
and
in
the
final
version
the
arbitrators
are
out
and
the
board
has
this
unwelcome
job
which
it
has
been
--
mr.
louis
sherman
and
this
of
course
was
the
complaint
which
was
that
before
it
could
make
the
determinations
rather
than
having
the
option
of
using
arbitration
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
for
that
purpose.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct
but
it
would
not
be
done
by
an
arbitrator.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may
say,
i
think
that
the
veto
message
was
merely
drawing
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
available
method
for
disposing
of
the
dispute
which
they
thought
superior
and
one
of
the
main
reasons
was
a
time
factor,
and
that's
spread
out
in
the
language
by
senator
morse,
would
not
be
available.
but
the
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
as
far
as
the
board's
construction
is
concerned
in
the
main
it
goes
to
the
point
that
whatever
the
employer
assigns
is
the
answer
because
if
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
i
went
through
the
record
and
there's
some
very
interesting
comments
about
that
from
the
employer
involved,
a
mr.
fitz
of
cbs,
where
he
says
that,
"having
these
conflicting
claims,
he
was
in
no
position
to
make
the
decision"
and
i
don't
think
he
was
talking
just
intellectually
or
academically.
at
one
point
here,
the
trial
examiner
who
served
the
case
said,
"mr.
fitz
testified
very
clearly
that
is
between
the
devil
and
the
deep
blue
and
trying
to
satisfy
both
of
them.
so
that
--
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
typical
situation
they
were
talking
about
was
an
employer
who
wasn't
breaking
his
neck,
shall
we
say,
in
making
decisions
between
powerful
unions
as
we're
talking
to
no
rights
case.
and
yet
the
dispute
--
now,
as
we
see
it
from
the
legislative
history
and
we
think
it's
born
out
by
it.
what
congress
intended
was
to
set
up
a
procedure
under
which
if
the
thing
was
serious
enough
to
warrant
a
strike,
that
there
would
be
some
way
of
settling
not
the
unfair
labor
practice.
that
would
be
of
adjudicated
in
accordance
with
regular
procedures,
but
the
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
arose.
in
this
case,
the
controversy
whether
the
ia
union
or
the
ip
union
should
have
the
work
referred
to
the
people
that
were
in
it's
bargaining
unit
or
under
its
contract
and
although
that
may
seem
to
be
a
frightening
thought
there
is
an
answer
to
it
as
developed
in
the
building
trades.
there's
nothing
to
stop
the
establishment
of
a
voluntary
body
for
settling
those
disputes.
mr.
louis
sherman
no
your
honor,
but
frankly
and
clearly,
what
the
congress
did
here
did
help
to
place
impetus
behind
the
establishment
of
a
voluntary
body
and
there
were
two
reasons
for
it.
one
was
the
language
of
the
act
and
the
other
was
this
very
thing
that's
been
mentioned
which
is
a
desire
of
the
parties,
particularly
in
the
building
trades
not
to
have
their
disputes
settled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
but
that
does
mean
that
because
they
desire
it
both
management
and
the
labor,
let
us
say,
that
that
changes
the
statutory
provisions
of
the
act
or
the
legislative
history
thereof.
there
were
two
things
they
didn't
want
to
have
happened.
now,
actually
there's
one
aspect
of
it
if
i
may
say
in
connection
with
this
joint
board
and
which
is
spread
in
our
brief.
that
their
problem
today
is
what
to
do
about
the
employer
who
decides
to
take
advantage
of
the
board
rule
and
what
is
the
board
rule?
board
rule
is
that
if
the
employer
assigns
the
work
then
we'll
have
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
is
an
order
of
certification
which
let's
say
in
this
industry
there
is
none,
but
they
don't
have
certifications.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
an
employer
does
not
have
the
incentive
to
become
a
part
of
this
voluntary
arrangement
because
he
can
by
assigning,
get
the
full
support
of
the
federal
government
to
restrain
any
conduct
in
violation
of
that
assignment.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
play
on
that
basis
for
the
development
of
a
voluntary
solution
of
the
problem.
and
as
i
say,
we
set
that
forth
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
which
is
the
position
of
the
joint
board.
we
assumed,
talking
about
these
policy
considerations,
that
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
recognized
to
have
this
function
but
then,
either
one
or
two
things
would
happen.
the
employers
will
now
--
do
not
wish
to
bind
themselves,
the
joint
board
procedure
would
do
so
or
if
they
didn't,
there
would
be
a
proceeding
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
joint
board
plan
just
to
see
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
they
think
they
have
the
--
every
reason
in
the
world.
in
other
words,
the
parties
would
rather
have
their
affair
settled
by
the
industry
than
they
would,
the
(inaudible)
mr.
louis
sherman
yes.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
they
wouldn't
be
doing
to
provoke
the
dispute.
what
we're
saying
that
since
they
have,
under
the
board
rule,
a
naked
power
to
assign
whichever
way
they
assign,
however
arbitrarily,
however
capriciously
and
then
get
the
support
of
the
federal
government
to
suppress
the
labor
activity
that
may
result
from
that
assignment
that
that
can
be
a
better
position
from
their
point
of
view
in
submitting
to
either
the
joint
board
or
submitting
to
the
--
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
will
try
to
answer
that
right
now.
certainly,
if
this
hearing
were
being
held
at
the
beginning
of
the
administration
of
the
wagner
act,
it
will
be
difficult
for
anyone
to
answer
that
question
in
terms
of,
shall
we
say,
how
are
all
the
appropriate
unit
questions
are
going
to
come
up
in
the
multiplicity
of
american
industry
going
to
be
decided,
particularly
since
those
issues
were
new
issues
as
distinguished
from
jurisdictional
dispute
matters
which
have
been
decided
and
which
exists
the
very
real
things
for
many,
many
years.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
there
has
been
no
governmental
action
of
this
sort.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
and
i
think
the
standards
that
would
apply,
i
would
certainly
hesitate
to
define
each
and
every
one
of
them
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
could
be
developed
a
series
of
sensible
approaches
to
that
problem
just
as
we
did
with
the
unit
questions
under
the
act,
but
it
would
not
just
be
custom
and
practice
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
your
honor
because
actually
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i
think
they
are
very
--
mr.
louis
sherman
--
they
are
very
different
in
legal
--
in
legal
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
agree
with
their
complete
--
they're
different
questions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
board
here
argues
its
position
with
respect
to
certifications
and
it
rules
that
a
certification
of
a
bargaining
unit
has
nothing
to
do
with
work
tasks.
that's
in
the
plumber's
case
and
in
general
analog.
they
are
different
but
they
are
the
same
in
this
sense
only,
your
honor
that
there
will
have
to
be
some
work
done
with
respect
to
development
of
appropriate
standards.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
that
work
will
be
much
easier
in
this
field.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
consequences.
the
work
will
be
easier
in
this
field
because
they
have
something
to
work
on.
your
honor,
permit
me,
we've
had
--
this
reference
made
the
national
labor
board
and
i've
gone
back
to
those
decisions.
the
new
york
telephone
company
case,
other
cases,
those
were
straight
out
jurisdictional
disputes
which
during
the
war,
were
handled
on
the
basis
of
an
arbitration
and
this
was
certainly
in
senator
morse's
mind
when
he
was
the
one
who
advanced
the
idea.
it
did
not
come
from
mr.
hartley,
did
not
come
from
mr.
taft.
it
came
from
senator
morse
and
it
was,
i
think,
pursuant
to
the
presidential
action
in
his
message.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
i
suppose
that
is
--
that
is
--
that's
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well
it's
a
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
if
--
mr.
louis
sherman
if
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well
--
well,
i'm
saying
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
borrow
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
that's
what
he
had
in
mind
when
he
made
his
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
would
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
must
respectfully
differ
your
honor
because
you
will
find,
if
you
compare
the
language
of
section
6
(k)
of
s.858
which
is
his
bill,
with
10
(k)
which
is
the
act
that
you
will
find
omitted
only
the
optional
authority
to
appoint
arbitrators.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
it
has
become
a
specialist
to
great
many,
your
honor.
i
don't
question
that.
mr.
louis
sherman
the
jurisdictional
dispute.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
and
there
wasn't
a
person,
your
honor
who
stood
up
and
said
that
the
effect
of
this
was
anything
other
than
the
elimination
of
this
option
to
appoint
an
arbitrator.
mr.
louis
sherman
to
do
that
which
is
to
argue
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
louis
sherman
the
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
it
would
be
a
government
arbitrator.
that's
right.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
the
language
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
actually,
the
conflict
came
between
the
house
bill
on
the
one
hand
which
was
intended
and
--
and
in
this
regard,
it
was
different
from
the
war,
a
restrictive
legal
prohibition
against
any
form
of
jurisdictional
strike
is
quite
no
matter
what
--
mr.
louis
sherman
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
don't
think
he
had
anything
and
i
think
this
was
added
by
senator
morse
prior
to
the
bill
--
let
me
get
straight.
senator
morse's
bill
came
in,
in
march.
the
bill
was
reported.
the
taft
bill
was
reported
in
april
and
the
taft
bill
as
reported
contained
the
language
which
is
pretty
close
to
what
we
have
now
and
it
contained
specifically
the
item
on
arbitrators.
well
as
you
first
have
the
morse's
bill
in
march
of
1947
then
you
have
the
taft
bill
as
reported
by
the
committee.
i'm
not
sure
about
what
bill
he
made
for
this.
mr.
louis
sherman
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
louis
sherman
no.
i'm
sure
he
didn't
have
(inaudible)
anything
in
here
until
morses
came
forward
with
the
proper
issue.
mr.
louis
sherman
well
if
your
honor
please,
we
look
at
the
language.
the
board
--
and
this
is
10
(k)
that
the
bill
has
--
and
as
passed.
"the
board
is
empowered
and
directed
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
such
unfair
labor
practice
shall
have
arisen
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator
to
hear
and
determine
such
dispute
unless
within
10
days
and
so
forth
upon
compliance
by
the
parties
to
dispute
with
the
decision
of
the
board,
or
the
arbitrator
appointed
by
the
board."
now
then,
we've
got
to
find
a
dichotomy
here
where
we're
talking
about
the
decision
of
the
board
meaning
one
thing
and
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
meaning
another
thing
and
the
very
sentence
which
gives
them
exactly
the
same
effect.
if
i
may
suggest
your
honor,
leaves
me
simpler
to
say
that
all
that
happened
here
was
--
they
decided
for
good
or
for
bad,
but
instead
of
having
these
matters
decided
by
arbitrators
at
the
option
of
the
board,
they
want
to
put
the
whole
job
in
the
hands
of
the
board.
mr.
louis
sherman
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
of
course
we
have
contemporaneous
--
mr.
louis
sherman
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
sherman
your
honor,
it
wasn't
very
different
as
far
as
i
can
see,
just
took
out
the
words
or
to
appoint
an
arbitrator.
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
louis
sherman
well,
even
--
even
arbitrator
is
merely
described.
in
other
words,
it's
as
if
ad
hoc
individual
as
distinguished
in
the
five-man
board
more
an
arbitrator
if
you
will,
but
the
function
is
the
same
to
hear
and
determine
the
dispute
out
of
which
the
unfair
labor
practice
arose.
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
because
i
do
think
that
the
congress
was
perhaps
a
little
more
far
seeing
than
the
board.
they
knew
about
these
disputes.
they're
tough
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
but
nevertheless,
just
as
they
believe,
people
can
refuse
to
settle
on
any
basis
that
strikes
to
recognition
would
be
lessened
if
there
were
certifications.
i
--
after
all,
the
certification
is
just
a
piece
of
paper
too,
but
people
tend
to
accept
these
things.
but
so
here
with
jurisdictional
disputes,
that
if
there
was
somebody
or
something
or
some
board,
which
would
actually
decide
the
jurisdictional
dispute
that
that
would
tend
to
reduce
the
dispute.
of
course
that's
what
we
found
on
the
joint
board,
that's
a
private
party
which
has
done
that.
the
problems
in
the
relationship
between
that
joint
board
and
the
national
labor
relations
board
as
i
say
covered.
mr.
louis
sherman
that
shows,
your
honor,
that
they
had
in
mind
this
very
thing
that
we're
talking
about
because
the
kind
of
dispute
they
were
going
to
settle
was
precisely
the
same
kind
of
dispute
they
thought
the
board
was
going
to
settle.
mr.
louis
sherman
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
last
paragraph
on
this
--
mr.
louis
sherman
that's
--
mr.
louis
sherman
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
that
was
what
i
was
going
to
add.
