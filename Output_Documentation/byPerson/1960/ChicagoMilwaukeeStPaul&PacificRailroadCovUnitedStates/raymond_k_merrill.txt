mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
litigation
represents
a
quest
for
equal
treatment
in
the
matter
of
freight
rates,
equal
treatment
for
shippers
who
use
the
milwaukee
railroad
between
spokane
and
the
twin
cities,
the
same
as
received
by
shippers
who
use
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
railroads.
it
also
represents
a
quest
for
equal
treatment
to
the
milwaukee
road,
the
same
as
is
given
to
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
in
the
way
of
joint
rates.
the
milwaukee
railroad
operates
from
chicago
and
indiana
on
the
east
by
way
of
milwaukee,
the
twin
cities,
spokane
to
seattle
and
tacoma
in
the
pacific
northwest.
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
composed
of
the
spokane
portland
in
seattle
railway,
the
oregon
electric
railway,
the
oregon
trunk
railway.
it
operates
from
spokane
on
the
east
to
vancouver
washington,
portland,
oregon
and
other
points
in
southern
washington
and
in
oregon.
it
is
owned
jointly
by
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific.
great
northern
operates
from
the
twin
cities
on
the
east
to
the
pacific
northwest
by
way
of
spokane
including
seattle,
tacoma,
portland
and
other
points.
the
northern
pacific
operates
partly
north
and
partly
south
of
the
milwaukee's
route
from
the
twin
cities
by
way
of
spokane
to
seattle,
tacoma
and
portland
and
other
points.
at
spokane,
washington,
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
have
a
complete
line
of
joint
rates
with
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system.
now,
the
essential
feature
of
a
joint
rate
is
that
two
railroads
have
agreed
to
transport
merchandise
or
traffic
from
a
point
on
one
railroad
to
a
point
on
another
at
a
combined
charge
lower
than
the
sum
of
their
two
local
rates.
on
the
other
end,
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
will
enter
into
only
a
limited
line
of
joint
rates
with
the
milwaukee.
on
the
other
traffic
which
could
be
interchanged
at
spokane,
combination
rates
would
apply
which
because
they
are
higher
than
the
joint
rates
applicable
if
the
traffic
moves
over
the
northern
pacific
or
the
great
northern
effectively
would
prevent
any
large
amount
or
any
fair
amount
of
traffic
to
move
by
the
milwaukee.
now,
a
combination
rate,
of
course,
is
the
sum
of
the
local
rate
or
one
carrier
to
the
junction
point
was
the
rate
of
the
other
carrier
from
the
junction
point
to
destination.
as
a
result
of
this
refusal
by
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
to
enter
into
a
complete
line
of
joint
rates
with
the
milwaukee,
the
milwaukee
is
short
hold
on
92%
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
traffic,
which
it
is
now
endowing
at
a
lost
and
revenue
to
the
milwaukee
of
over
$2.5
million
per
year.
now,
that
works
this
way.
the
milwaukee,
if
it
has
traffic
going
to
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
originating
in
the
midwest
or
in
the
east
or
in
the
south
can
take
it
as
far
as
the
twin
cities.
and
there
is
compelled
to
surrender
the
traffic
to
either
the
great
northern
or
the
northern
pacific
who
then
take
under
spokane
and
give
it
to
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system.
in
coming
the
other
way,
the
milwaukee
is
not
permitted
to
solicit
the
traffic
at
spokane
at
joint
rates
but
must
wait
until
the
traffic
reaches
the
twin
cities
in
order
to
participate
in
the
hall
at
the
joint
rates,
which
are
sought
in
this
case.
now,
this
deprives
the
shippers
the
use
of
the
milwaukee's
route
between
spokane
and
the
twin
cities
except
for
the
rate
penalty
in
many
shipments
and
it
does
deprive
the
milwaukee
with
its
right
to
solicit
this
traffic.
accordingly
back
in
1954,
the
milwaukee
filed
a
complaint
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
it
charged
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
was
in
violation
of
section
1
(4),
which
requires
that
every
common
carrier
subject
to
the
act
to
establish
reasonable
through
routes
with
other
such
carriers
and
just
and
reasonable
rates,
charges
and
so
forth
applicable
thereto.
it
also
charged
the
s.
p.
&
s.
with
the
violation
of
section
3
(1)
of
the
act
and
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
common
carrier
to
make,
give
or
cause
any
undo
or
unreasonable
preference
or
advantage
to
any
particular
person,
locality,
or
to
subject
any
particular
person,
firm,
locality
and
so
forth
to
any
undo
or
unreasonable
precedence
or
advantage.
it
charged
the
s.
p.
&
s.
with
a
violation
of
section
3
for
the
interstate
commerce
that
requires
that
all
carriers
shall
not
discriminate
in
their
rates,
fares
and
charges
between
connecting
lines.
the
milwaukee
and
both
the
powers
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
section
15
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
gives
the
commission
the
power
and
the
duty
to
correct
violations
of
the
act
and
invoked
the
power
of
the
commission
under
section
15
(3),
which
requires
the
commission
when
it
finds
it
desirable
and
the
public
interest
to
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates
applicable
thereto.
as
soon
as
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
northern
pacific
and
the
great
northern
promptly
intervened
and
claimed
that
under
section
15
(4),
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
commission
cannot
require
through
routes
by
any
carrier
or
in
connection
with
any
carrier
which
requires
that
railroad
without
its
consent
to
embrace
in
such
routes
substantially
less
than
the
entire
length
of
its
railroad
and
of
any
intermediate
railroad
operated
in
conjunction
and
under
a
common
management
or
control
therewith
which
lies
between
the
termini
of
the
proposed
through
route.
and
the
great
northern
said,
we
are
under
common
management
or
control
with
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
and
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
long-haul
over
our
line
as
well
as
over
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system.
and
the
northern
pacific
filed
their
petition
for
intervention
and
they
said,
well,
we
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
15
(4)
because
we
are
under
common
management
or
control
with
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system,
and
they
both
then
asserted
the
same
claim
each
claiming
to
be
under
common
management
or
control
with
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system.
and
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
resolved
that
if
i
move
by
answering
that
they
were
under
common
management
or
control
with
both
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific.
so
the
milwaukee
denied
the
affirmative
allegations
of
common
management
or
control
and
put
the
defendants
and
their
intervenors
upon
proof
with
respect
thereto.
at
the
hearing
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
of
the
united
states
intervened
on
behalf
of
the
milwaukee
along
with
the
western
forest
industries
and
national
livestock
producers
association,
the
american
national
cattlemen's
association,
the
national
wool
growers
association
and
the
chicago
producers
commission
association
representing
thousands
of
livestock,
growers,
cattlemen,
wool
growers
and
livestock
producers
in
the
western
states,
also
appearing
in
behalf
of
the
railroad
as
an
intervenor.
in
behalf
of
the
milwaukee
was
the
traffic
bureau
of
sioux
falls,
south
dakota
and
association
of
shippers
and
receivers
of
great
at
that
point.
the
milwaukee
had
to
name
about
300
railroads
as
defendants
in
order
that
there
would
be
no
question
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
to
prescribe
joint
rates
and
through
routes
in
this
case
if
through
routes
were
necessary.
out
of
these
300
railroads
only
five,
the
chicago
burlington
in
quincy
which
is
a
subsidiary
of
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
and
the
northwestern
and
the
minneapolis
in
st.
louis
which
is
now
one
railroad
and
the
chicago
rock
island
in
pacific
opposed
the
granting
of
the
relief
sought.
intervenors
on
behalf
of
the
great
northern,
northern
pacific
and
s.
p.
&
s.
consisted
of
some
labor
groups
of
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific.
hearings
were
held.
many
railroad
witnesses
testified
and
many
shipper
witnesses
testified
on
both
sides.
and
two
years
later
in
1956,
the
examiner
issued
a
proposed
report
finding
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
under
common
management
or
control
with
each
of
the
northern
lines.
his
proposed
report
found
that
there
are
no
through
routes
presently
existing
except
for
a
joint
rates
supply
and
found
that,
however,
the
present
rates
on
lumber
and
fresh
fruits,
and
vegetables
and
livestock
moving
from
points
on
the
s.
p.
&
s.
to
points
on
the
milwaukee
and
its
connections
were
unreasonable,
unjust,
unduly
preferential
and
prejudicial
and
the
same
pointing
was
made
with
respect
to
westbound
traffic
terminating
on
the
s.
p.
&
s.
from
points
on
the
milwaukee
and
its
connections
of
coal,
agricultural
implements,
iron,
steel,
grain,
beans,
grain
and
hogs.
the
examiner
also
proposed
the
finding
that
through
routes
were
necessary
and
desirable
in
order
to
provide
adequate
and
more
economic
transportation
to
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates
for
these
commodities
in
the
directions
indicated.
the
following
year
1957,
the
commission
came
out
with
its
report
and
it
adopted
almost
verbatim
the
examiner's
language
especially
as
discussion
of
the
evidence
but
ended
enough
saying
that
we
disagree
and
find
that
the
conclusions
of
the
examiner,
the
present
rates,
cost,
undue
preference
of
prejudice
or
unjust
and
unreasonable
is
not
correct
and
they
found
that
there
were
not
--
there
was
no
such
violation
of
the
act
as
indicated
by
the
examiner,
and
they
found
that
there
was
no
need
in
order
to
provide
adequate
more
economic
transportation
to
establish
through
routes
and
joint
rates.
in
due
time,
a
petition
for
reconsideration
was
denied
by
the
commission,
the
litigation
moved
to
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
to
wisconsin
and
four
issues
were
brought
before
the
court
and
they
were
stipulated
by
the
parties
as
issues
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
number
one,
whether
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
or
is
not
under
common
management
or
control
with
each
of
the
competing
northern
lines,
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(4)
for
the
interstate
commerce
act
whether
through
routes
presently
exist
in
any
case
except
where
the
presently
limited
line
of
joint
rates
apply.
next,
whether
their
--
the
present
rates
constitute
a
violation
of
section
3
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
with
respect
to
preference
and
prejudice
against
localities
and
shippers
and
with
respect
to
discrimination
against
the
milwaukee.
and
fourth
whether,
the
evidence
required
the
finding
that
the
routes
are
needed
to
provide
adequate
and
more
economic
transportation.
in
the
district
court,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
intervened
as
a
plaintiff
as
did
the
national
livestock
producers,
the
american
national
cattlemen,
the
national
wool
growers,
and
the
chicago
producers
commission.
it
took
two
years
to
get
an
opinion
in
this
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
in
1960,
the
district
court
opinion
discussed
the
first
issue
only
held
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
support
the
findings
or
provision
to
the
second,
third
and
fourth
issue.
now,
the
first
issue
was
a
question
of
common
management
or
control.
and
the
district
court
said
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
under
common
management
or
control
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
whereupon,
an
appeal
is
taken
to
this
court
by
the
milwaukee
and
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
again,
the
same
four
issues
are
presented
for
determination.
after
the
briefs
were
field
and
discussion
was
held
by
myself
with
the
attorneys,
with
the
department
of
agriculture,
it
was
determined
that
since
the
parties
rely
upon
the
same
points
that
their
position
is
in
a
sense
identical
that
one
argument
could
be
presented
and
i
am
undertaking
to
do
so.
the
argument,
however,
represents
the
views
of
the
department
of
agriculture
that
incurs
therein.
and
so
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
we
are
coming
to
that
right
now.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
now,
as
in
the
recent
through
route
joint
rate
cases,
the
question
of
whether
section
15
(4)
which
puts
restrictions
on
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
prescribe
through
routes
is
a
very
important
feature
in
this
litigation.
of
course,
section
15
(4)
has
no
application
if
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
not
under
common
management
or
control
with
each
of
the
northern
lines
if
through
routes
already
exists
by
which
additional
joint
rates
are
now
sought,
if
the
refusal
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
to
enter
in
the
joint
rates
and
through
routes
with
the
milwaukee
railroad
is
a
violation
of
section
3
of
the
act.
and
even
if
15
(4)
does
apply,
if
the
routes
are
needed
to
provide
adequate,
more
economic
and
efficient
transportation,
then
the
commission
should
establish
those
routes.
and
so,
we
come
to
the
first
question
as
found
by
the
commission
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
under
common
management
or
control
with
each
of
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
railroad.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
alright
sir,
the
next
question
then
is
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i'm
sorry
i
thought
you
wanted
me
to
proceed
to
the
next
question.
if
you
agree
with
our
position,
there
is
no
need
to
consider
the
other
questions.
a
matter
should
be
remanded
to
the
commission
because
in
that
event,
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
discriminating
against
the
milwaukee
railroad
by
refusing
to
enter
into
the
same
rates
with
it,
and
it
does
with
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
and
the
restrictions
which
the
commission
said
applied
to
its
power
to
prescribe
joint
rates
or
through
routes
under
section
15
(4)
would
have
no
application.
so
it
should
go
back
to
the
commission
with
the
idea
that
they
would
then
proceed
to
consider
the
case
free
and
clear
from
the
limitations
of
section
15
(4).
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
we
contend
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
we
do
contend
that
with
respect
to
through
routes?
there
--
there
are,
as
a
matter
of
law,
through
routes
on
the
basis
of
decisions
which
say
that
joint
rates
as
a
matter
of
law
presuppose
through
routes
and
we
argue
that
the
existing
joint
rates
established
those
through
routes.
also,
we
argue
that
a
finding
made
by
the
commission
as
a
matter
of
law
necessitates
a
final
finding
that
through
routes
exist
and
i
will
come
to
that
and
try
to
develop,
sir.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
would
say
this,
your
honor.
if
any
of
the
first
three
issues
are
found
in
our
favor,
there
is
a
requirement
that
it'd
be
remanded
to
the
commission
because
15
(4)
would
have
no
application
if
any
of
those
three
as
we
argue
were
true
in
this
case.
the
statutory
language
of
15
(4)
is
as
noted
by
the
district
court
below,
cast
in
the
singular.
it
says
in
establishing
any
through
route
that
the
commission
shall
not,
and
i'm
omitting
this
--
an
immaterial
part
of
it.
require
any
carrier
by
railroad
without
its
consent
to
embrace
in
such
route
substantially
less
than
the
entire
length
of
this
railroad
and
of
any
intermediate
railroad
operated
in
conjunction
and
under
a
common
management
or
control
therewith
which
--
which
lies
between
the
termini
as
such
proposed
route.
now,
right
away,
the
question
is
a
railroad
and
any
intermediate
railroad
operated
in
conjunction
and
under
a
common
management
or
control
therewith,
the
question
is
what
meaning
did
congress
intend?
do
they
mean
any
railroad
and
an
intermediate
railroad
operated
under
a
joint
control?
or
does
the
owning
railroad
have
to
be
the
sole
owner
or
the
dominating
owner?
this
court
said
in
the
united
states
versus
american
railway
express
265
u.s.
of
431,
that
this
language
aptly
describes
a
single
railroad
system.
and
i
presume
the
best
--
one
of
the
best
sources
of
determining
the
meaning
of
the
act
is
to
look
at
the
legislation
from
which
it
emerges.
this
language
of
common
management
or
control
was
added
to
the
interstate
commerce
act
by
the
mann-elkins
act
in
the
year
1910.
and
in
section
12
of
the
mann-elkins
act
which
contains
this
language
and
which
--
also
modifies
other
sections
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
congress
had
no
--
no
problem
at
all
about
making
itself
clear
when
it
meant
to
refer
to
more
than
the
single
railroad
system.
it
used
the
term
carrier
or
carrier
seven
different
times
and
the
term
line
or
lines
two
different
times.
and
if
we
look
at
section
15
(3)
which
has
many
subparagraphs,
we
find
that
congress
again
had
no
trouble
in
expressing
itself
when
it
wanted
to
refer
to
more
than
a
single
railroad
system.
in
paragraph
(1),
it
refers
to
carrier
or
carriers
and
to
individual
or
joint
class
--
classifications,
regulations
or
practices.
on
a
paragraph
(3),
in
paragraph
(7),
paragraph
(8),
in
paragraph
(13),
they
referred
to
carriers
or
carriers
connecting
line
or
lines,
individual
or
joint
rates
and
so
forth.
then
when
they
deal
specifically
with
the
question
of
control,
which
is
section
15
(2)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
they
again
spelled
it
out
by
saying
that
it
shall
be
lawful
with
the
consent
of
the
commission
or
any
carrier
or
two
or
more
carriers
jointly
to
acquire
control
of
another.
all
--
i
think
it
is
also
proper
to
look
to
whatever
explanation
the
senate
committee
which
recommended
the
enactment
of
this
legislation
had
to
say
about
the
meaning
of
this
short-haul
protection.
and
this
senate
committee
had
this
to
say,
it
would
seem
to
be
unreasonable
to
empower
the
commission
to
require
a
railroad
having
a
line
of
its
own
between
two
designated
termini
to
allow
a
portion
only
of
that
line
to
be
taken
and
linked
up
with
other
lines
for
the
purpose
of
creating
another
through
route
in
competition
with
it.
and
i
think
the
emphasis
can
well
be
laid
on
the
words
having
a
line
of
its
own.
the
another
way
of
determining
the
meaning
of
congress
is
to
look
at
the
sections
of
the
act
most
closely
related
to
the
--
the
section
in
which
the
language
in
question
appears.
and
for
that
purpose,
we
can
turn
to
section
1
and
section
3,
which
the
commission
has
said,
are
the
sections
most
closely
related
to
section
15?
section
1
and
particular
paragraph
(4),
the
commission
says
that
the
theory
of
this
provision
is
a
carrier
should
freely
interchange
rate
between
their
respective
lines
to
the
end
that
interstate
commerce
may
move
without
interruption
or
delay.
and
referring
to
paragraph
(3),
the
commission
--
or
section
3,
the
commission
says
that
this
provision
brought
in
section
1
and
makes
the
intent
of
the
congress
claim
that
every
reasonable
and
proper
facility
shall
be
extended
equally
by
a
carrier
to
all
of
its
connections
and
at
no
discrimination
in
its
charges
shall
be
made
in
favor
of
or
against
any
connecting
line.
well,
actually
we
have
to
wait
for
30
years
to
go
by
to
get
confirmation
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
joint
control
but
intended
only
that
control
by
one
carrier
of
another
as
what
was
intended
by
the
term
common
management
or
control.
and
in
the
year
1940,
congress
enacted
section
1
(3)
(b)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
in
that
section,
they
provided
that
in
various
sections
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
when
the
word
control
was
encountered,
it
was
to
be
given
a
broad
interpretation.
it
was
to
include
actual
as
well
as
legal
control
and
direct
as
well
indirect
control
no
matter
how
exercised.
but
the
commission
very
carefully
omitted
section
15
(4)
as
a
section
in
which
the
word
control
should
be
given
that
broad
connotation.
the
--
it
might
have
been
due
to
oversight
that
the
joint
conference
committee
that
reported
out
the
legislation
made
it
plain
that
this
was
deliberate.
and
they
said,
the
reason
that
it
is
not
included
is
that
the
congress
is
--
does
not
desire
and
that
it
is
not
desirable
rather
that
any
change
be
made
in
the
present
interpretation
of
section
15
(4).
so,
then
it
is
very
important
and
the
apellees
concede,
it
important
that
we
look
at
and
see
how
the
commission
had
been
decided
these
questions
under
section
15
(4)
prior
to
1940.
and
the
search
of
the
commission
cases,
i
find
that
there
were
11
occasions
in
which
the
commission
ruled
on
whether
or
not
a
carrier
was
under
common
management
or
control
with
another
within
the
meaning
of
15
(4)
and
in
every
case
one
railroad
was
in
control
by
virtue
of
majority
stock
ownership.
during
that
same
period,
there
were
three
cases
which
arose
in
which
the
question
of
joint
control
was
contended
by
the
parties
as
constituting
common
management
or
control.
in
the
first
case,
the
(inaudible)
case
back
in
1910,
cited
--
or
1914,
four
years
after
this
law
was
enacted
embracing
the
words
common
management
or
control
and
cited
on
page
26
of
our
brief.
two
railroads
jointly
owned
eight-ninths
of
the
stock
of
a
--
of
a
third
railroad
and
together,
they
elected
the
majority
of
the
board
of
directors
of
this
railroad.
and
it
was
contented
that
this
joint
control
placed
one
of
the
owners
and
the
subsidiary
under
common
management
or
control
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(4).
this
notion,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
rejected
and
said
they
were
not
under
common
management
or
control
within
the
meaning
of
that
section.
the
case
itself
involved
--
included
evidence,
however,
that
the
owning
railroads
although
they
had
obviously
the
power
of
control
do
not
see
fit
to
exercise,
they
gave
a
free
hand
to
the
subsidiary
railroad
to
run
its
own
affairs.
the
--
to
the
extent
that
that
evidence
is
in
the
record,
the
appellees
here
would
contend
that
that
distinguishes
the
case
from
the
present
case,
that
if
the
railroads
in
that
case
had
exercised
a
control
actively
as
the
northern
lines
claimed
to
jointly
control
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system,
that
would
have
been
a
different
matter.
well
now,
that
means
that
the
railroad
can
turn
on
and
off
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
prescribe
through
routes
or
joint
rates
simply
one
month
telling
the
subsidiary
to
go
ahead
and
run
your
own
affairs
in
the
next
month
say,
well,
this
month
we'll
tell
you
what
to
do.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
power
was
ever
vested
in
the
railroads
themselves.
and
finally,
just
before
that
decision
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
federal
court
said
that,
you
can't
distinguish
between
this
power
control
and
not
exercising
it
and
actual
joint
control.
because
it's
vain
to
say
that
the
subsidiary
railroad
is
not
aware
of
the
wishes
of
the
two
joint
owners
and
that
it's
clear
that
because
they
are
aware
of
those
joint
wishes,
they
are
subject
to
their
joint
control.
but
all
that
the
commission
deciding
them
that
such
control
does
not
fall
within
section
15
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
case
is
very
significant.
the
other
two
cases
involved
in
the
terminal
railroad
association
of
st.
louis
along
by
15
railroads
and
as
the
commission
said,
controlled
by
a
majority
of
them.
in
two
cases
in
which
it
was
contended,
one
--
that
one
of
the
owning
railroads
was
under
common
management
or
control
terminal
and
in
the
other
case
that
all
of
the
owning
railroads
were
under
common
management
or
control
of
the
terminal
railroad.
the
commission
said,
no,
that
is
not
common
management
or
control
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(4).
now,
those
are
the
only
three
cases
in
which
the
commission
definitely
ruled
that
on
the
question
whether
joint
control
was
common
management
or
control
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(4)
prior
to
1940.
there's
another
case
that
comes
up
later
on
involving
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
and
the
question
of
short-hauling
and
two
cases
that
came
up
prior
to
1940
involving
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
and
the
question
of
joint
hauling.
this
question
--
these
three
cases
are
very
enlightening.
in
the
first
case,
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
cancelled
its
through
routes
with
the
union
pacific
whereby
the
s.
p.
&
s.
would
haul
traffic
to
portland,
oregon
and
then
turn
it
or
to
the
union
pacific
to
haul
beyond.
complaints
were
filed
seeking
the
reinstatement
of
those
through
routes.
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
came
in
and
said,
we
are
entitled
to
our
full
long
haul
to
spokane
of
500
miles.
they
did
not
claim
they
were
entitled
to
a
full
long
haul
over
their
line
and
then
the
great
northern
over
their
line
and
then
the
northern
pacific
as
far
as
the
twin
cities
as
they
are
claiming
in
this
present
case.
they
said,
as
far
as
full
can.
we
point
out
in
this
case
that
the
--
no
contention
was
made
that
they
were
entitled
to
that
longer
haul
and
that
the
commission
made
no
finding
they
were
and
the
railroad
appellees
in
this
case
contend
well,
the
northern
lines
weren't
parties
to
that
case.
but
the
report
shows
that
the
members
of
the
transcontinental
freight
bureau
were
represented
at
the
hearing
and
that
the
commission's
file
shows
they
filed
a
brief
and
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
have
always
been
members
of
the
transcontinental
freight
bureau.
in
the
second
case,
it
involved
the
question
or
complaints
seeking
through
routes
from
origins
on
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
other
railroads
to
spokane
and
then
via
canadian
routes
to
destinations
back
in
the
united
states.
and
it
was
contended
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
there
was
under
common
management
or
control
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
this
through
routes
--
to
the
protection
of
their
through
routes
over
the
northern
pacific
and
the
great
northern
east
to
spokane.
the
icc,
however,
avoided
a
decision
whether
or
not
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
were
under
common
management
or
control
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(4)
by
saying,
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
prescribe
through
routes
by
its
--
by
its
candidate.
and
so,
from
the
statutory
language
of
section
15
(4)
from
the
law
from
which
it
emerged,
from
the
statute
with
which
it
forms
apart,
from
the
laws
with
which
it
is
to
be
read
to
most
closely
in
connection
with,
and
from
the
indication
by
congress
itself
as
to
what
it
meant
by
approving
the
decisions
of
the
commission
and
by
reference
to
those
decisions
of
the
commission,
we
can
come
to
only
one
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
refer
to
a
single
railroad
system.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
there
is
a
case
where
two
lines
owned
eight-ninths
of
the
stock,
sir.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
either
would
be
minority
and
so
with
two
lines
so
each
owned
50%
being
minority
owner.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
webster
defines
a
minority
owner
is
having
the
both
so
less
than
the
amount
necessary
to
control
and
that
requires
something
over
at
50%
as
i
interpret
the
language.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
as
long
as
the
two
owning
the
51%
can
and
do
elect
the
majority
of
the
board
of
directors,
i
would
say
they
have
the
power
jointly
to
control
the
corporation.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
would
go
further
sir,
i
would
say
that
if
in
this
case
there
were
two
carriers,
so
each
owned
49%
of
the
corporation
of
the
subsidiary
and
one
carrier
who
owned
only
2%,
the
carrier
with
2%
would
have
just
as
much
power
as
those
two
with
49.
because
all
that
carrier
need
to
do
would
be
to
join
with
one
of
the
other
two
carriers
and
by
that
way
assert
as
well
as
to
what
would
happen
and
hence
two
carriers
with
50%
who
completely
neutralize
each
other
so
that
the
other
cannot
move
neither
have
control.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
yes,
sir.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
there
would
not
be
a
separate
railroad,
as
i
understand
your
question,
sir.
they
would
each
be
jointly
operating
over
jointly
owned
property.
they
each
would
be
operating
in
their
own
name
under
as
in
their
own
right
and
in
the
instant
case,
they
have
created
a
carrier
subject
to
all
the
requirements
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
a
carrier
who
cannot,
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
discriminate
against
other
railroads
and
who
cannot
charge
rates
with
their
preferential
or
prejudicial.
those
to
me
the
--
the
situation
is
entirely
different.
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
are
neither
obligated
to
nor
are
authorized
to
serve
the
points
which
are
reached
by
the
spokane
impartment
in
seattle
railroad
except
in
a
few
limited
places
where
they
are
as
common
points
with
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific.
and
so
having
created
a
railroad
which
is
subject
to
all
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
then
they
are
in
a
different
position
than
have
they
elected
to
operate
themselves
either
in
a
partnership
or
individually.
now,
the
appellees
in
this
case,
however,
are
not
very
anxious
to
be
bound
by
what
the
commission
has
done
in
through
route
cases,
and
they
find
more
to
their
liking
what
the
commission
has
done
in
so-called
rate
making
cases.
but
the
railroad
appellees
in
their
brief
of
themselves
point
out
that
these
rate
making
cases
arise
under
section
15,
paragraph
(1)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
under
that
paragraph,
there
is
no
reference
to
the
term
common
management
or
control
whatever.
the
rulings
of
the
commission
under
that
section
therefore,
have
no
occasion
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
congress
as
intended
by
the
words
common
management
or
control.
the
commission
for
its
own
convenience,
however,
in
prescribing
rates
sometimes
will
set
up
within
a
limited
area
distant
scale
rates
where
every
five
miles
the
rate
steps
up.
and
for
two
railroads,
they
will
permit
a
higher
rate
to
be
charged
and
the
reason
is
that
there's
an
interchange
of
traffic
between
the
two
railroads
requiring
a
little
extra
terminal
cost
and
they
reflect
that
by
giving
the
joint
lines
a
higher
rate.
and
appellee
say
in
those
cases,
the
commission
where
there
is
common
management
or
control,
the
two
railroads
have
said
you
must
charge
a
single
higher
rate.
and
that
the
commission
has
extended
that
to
a
situation
where
two
jointly
--
where
a
railroad
jointly
owned
by
two
other
carriers
participates
in
the
hall.
now,
i
can
only
point
out
that
that
is
not
the
type
of
a
case
which
involves
interpretation
of
common
management
or
control
as
intended
by
congress.
and
we
can
also
point
out
what
the
commission
isn't
even
consistent
in
those
kind
of
cases.
and
in
a
case
in
which
the
southern
pacific
owned
50%
of
its
subsidiary
railroad,
the
other
50%
was
controlled
by
a
state
that
the
southern
pacific
elected
two
of
the
directors
and
the
state
elected
two
of
the
directors
and
two
interest
together
appointed
a
fifth
neutral
director.
and
the
question
arose
whether
or
not
a
movement
or
traffic
over
the
southern
pacific
in
the
subsidiary
line
was
a
joint
line
haul
or
a
single
line
haul,
the
commission
permitted
the
charging
of
the
joint
line
haul.
now,
the
commission
says
that
seven
times
we
have
said
that
for
rate
making
purposes,
the
s.
p.
&
s.is
a
part
of
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific.
actually,
two
of
those
cases
are
through
route
cases.
i've
already
mentioned
one,
i'm
saving
one.
the
other
--
the
other
five,
the
commission
commented
that
--
i
think
in
four
of
them,
that
for
rate
making
purposes
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
deemed
a
part
of
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific.
but
i
cannot
determine
after
reading
those
cases
a
dozen
times
or
something
less
than
that,
just
what
they
meant
by
saying
that
they
were
a
part
of
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
for
rate
making
purposes
except
in
one
case
in
which
they
were
fixing
the
valuation
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
and
the
commission
said
that
in
computing
the
cost
of
transporting
material
over
the
northern
lines
that
is
used
in
the
construction
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system,
you
will
use
the
company
line
haul
rates
rather
than
the
commercial
rates.
the
other
cases,
the
commission
was
not
prescribing
joint
line
scales.
they
were
not
granting
arbitraries.
just
what
importance
the
fact
that
the
commission
said
they
should
be
regarded
for
rate
making
purposes
as
one
line
is
certainly
not
clear.
and
in
this
valuation
pace,
they
neutralize
that
by
an
approximately
the
same
time
in
another
case
involving
the
valuation
of
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
said
that
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
cannot
include
in
their
valuation
about
the
cost
of
constructing
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
and
therefore
indicated
by
that
decision
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
was
not
to
be
deemed
a
part
of
the
great
northern
or
the
northern
pacific
system.
now,
the
lower
court
and
the
appellee
say
if
you
take
away
the
protection
of
section
15
(4)
from
a
railroad
which
is
under
common
management
or
control
with
two
jointly
owned
railroads
then
they
are
not
--
they're
already
prevented
from
getting
arbitraries
where
hauls
which
the
commission
awards
to
some
short
lines
that
are
not
under
common
management
or
control
with
two
standard
carriers.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
utterly
unfair
in
this
case
to
hold
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
not
entitled
to
the
short-haul
protection
under
section
15
(4).
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
commission
has
never
had
any
trouble
about
giving
arbitraries
and
here,
our
own
arbitrary
is
that
--
is
that
some
additional
charge
with
--
which
a
railroad
which
is
a
weak
railroad
financially
and
generally
less
than
100
miles
along
the
short
line
has
permitted
the
charge
in
addition
to
the
regular
rate.
one
railroad,
the
camas
prairie
jointly
owned
by
the
union
pacific
and
northern
pacific,
arbitraries
was
approved
--
were
approved
for
that
railroad,
another
railroad,
the
oregon-california
and
eastern
railroad
jointly
owned
by
the
great
northern
and
the
southern
pacific
permitted
to
charge
arbitraries.
another
one
the
sunset
railway
jointly
owned
by
the
atchison,
topeka,
santa
fe
and
the
southern
pacific
jointly
allowed
to
charge
was
allowed
to
charge
arbitraries.
and
the
contour
is
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
itself
according
to
the
commission
in
a
case
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
here
charges
arbitraries
on
traffic
moving
over
its
own
branch
lines.
so
how
there
would
be
any
discrimination
or
any
ill
results
as
far
as
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
concerned
is
not
and
all
clear
if
they
were
bound
not
to
be
under
common
management
or
control
with
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
with
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
railroad,
excuse
me.
as
far
as
joint
line
rates
are
concern,
there's
no
evidence
that
anywhere
ever
prescribed
in
the
s.
p.
&
s.
territory
but
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
doesn't
need
joint
line
rates
in
14
different
tariffs
where
the
rates
are
figured
on
a
distant
scale
and
the
traffic
moves
over
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
then
the
great
northern
for
the
s.
p.
&
s.
in
the
northern
pacific
while
they
compute
the
distance
over
their
own
line
up
to
the
junction
point,
charge
the
rate
for
that
movement
and
then
compute
the
distance
over
the
northern
pacific
and
the
great
northern
charge
the
rate
for
that
movement.
and
they
say
we'll
collect
the
aggregate
charge
which
is
higher,
of
course,
and
which
they
treated
themselves
as
a
single
line
in-charge
the
rates
over
the
combined
distance.
and
here
is
that
case
that
i
was
saving.
it
happens
to
be
helix
milling
company
case
in
1952.
in
that
case,
the
complainant
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
helix
milling
company
case
you
honor.
it's
referred
to
on
page
55
of
our
brief
and
it's
287
icc
77.
in
that
case,
joint
rates
were
sought
on
wheat
and
wheat
products
from
certain
points
in
montana
on
the
great
northern
to
go
to
spokane
and
then
to
be
hauled
by
the
northern
pacific
from
spokane
to
pasco,
washington
and
to
receive
milling
in
transit,
and
then
from
pasco,
washington
onto
portland,
oregon.
already
existing
were
through
routes
over
which
the
shipment
can
move
to
spokane
or
over
the
great
northern
and
then
the
spokane
portland
in
seattle
railroad
on
to
destination.
now,
the
northern
pacific
was
not
adverse
to
joining
in
these
rates
and
routes
but
the
great
northern
and
the
southern
--
and
the
s.
p.
&
s.
both
came
in
and
contended
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
short-haul
protection
of
15
(4).
and
if
these
routes
were
prescribed,
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
would
be
short-hauled
by
the
northern
pacific
railroad.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
this
is
the
great
northern
and
the
northern
pacific
have
always
joined
owned
the
s.
p.
&
s.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
oh
yes,
sir,
since
1910,
and
this
was
42
years
later.
and
so
the
great
northern
and
s.
p.
&
s.
contended
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
would
get
a
short-hauling
in
this
case
if
the
routes
were
established.
the
commission
recognized
that
there
was
a
short-hauling
issue
because
they
went
--
had
to
make
all
the
findings.
they
quoted
section
15
(4)
and
then
they
made
the
findings
that
these
routes
were
necessary
to
provide
adequate
and
more
economic
transportation
and
ordered
the
routes
installed.
and
certainly,
we
failed
to
understand
how
if
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
is
to
be
treated
separately
from
the
great
northern
or
the
northern
pacific
and
again,
invoke
section
15
(4)
to
require
the
commission
to
make
the
additional
findings
with
short-haul,
how
they
can
in
this
case
contend
that
they
are
actually
only
one
in
the
same
part
of
the
great
northern,
one
in
the
same
with
the
northern
pacific
and
try
to
invoke
the
short-haul
protection
for
both
the
s.
p.
&
s.,
the
great
northern,
and
the
northern
pacific.
that
takes
us
to
the
second
point
of
the
through
routes.
through
routes
is
a
rather
troublesome
subject.
the
definition
is
simple
enough.
it's
an
arrangement
express
or
implied
between
two
or
more
carriers
for
the
continuous
carriage
to
goods
from
a
point
on
one
railroad
to
a
point
on
the
other.
the
form
of
the
rate
whether
it's
a
combination
rate,
whether
it's
a
joint
rate,
makes
no
difference
that
was
so
held
by
thompson
versus
united
states,
343
u.s.,
549.
the
fact
that
the
route
is
not
commercially
opened
because
the
level
of
the
rate
is
too
high
to
permit
a
movement
does
not
matter
said
this
court
in
virginian
railroad
versus
united
states
272
u.s.,
658,
and
in
a
more
recent
case,
great
northern
versus
united
states,
81
f.supp.921,
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
the
commission
itself
argued
that
if
a
route
is
commercially
closed,
it
does
not
necessarily
mean
there
is
not
a
through
route
and
the
district
court
affirmed
position
of
the
commission
and
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
now
in
this
case,
the
milwaukee
railroad
enters
into
a
complete
line
of
joint
rates
with
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
over
the
milwaukee's
lines
from
the
twin
cities
and
east.
at
the
twin
cities,
the
milwaukee
can
take
any
commodity
that
originates
on
the
s.
p.
&
s.
railroad,
take
it
anywhere
on
its
system
or
to
points
on
its
connections.
and
coming
from
the
other
direction,
traffic
going
to
the
s.
p.
&
s.
,
the
milwaukee
can
take
any
commodity
over
its
lines
east
of
the
twin
cities,
but
would
--
in
most
cases,
they're
under
it
to
the
great
northern
nor
the
northern
pacific
at
the
twin
cities
to
take
on
the
spokane.
so
the
east
of
the
twin
cities,
the
milwaukee
is
not
seeking
through
routes.
they're
already
there
or
seeking
through
routes
over
our
line
from
spokane
to
the
twin
cities.
over
the
route
from
spokane
to
the
twin
cities,
joint
rates
presently
apply
on
lumber
and
forest
products
from
all
s.
p.
&
s.
origins
to
all
local
points
on
the
milwaukee
railroad
not
only
along
our
line
from
spokane
to
the
twin
cities
but
east
of
the
twin
cities
as
far
as
the
point
just
short
of
chicago.
and
finally,
there
are
joint
rates
on
all
commodities
over
our
lines
all
the
way
from
spokane,
all
the
way
to
chicago
and
other
points
on
traffic
moving
in
export
and
import
traffic,
and
that
embraces
any
conceivable
commodity
that
can
move
by
railroad
and
the
same
is
true
on
the
westbound
traffic.
the
milwaukee
already
has
through
routes
than
on
every
commodity
which
can
move
over
its
line
between
spokane
and
the
twin
cities
and
points
beyond.
now,
these
routes,
of
course,
do
not
apply
except
in
connection,
as
i
say,
with
lumber
and
forest
products
to
points
on
the
milwaukee
short
to
chicago,
or
they
only
apply
to
traffic
roaming
in
export
or
import
traffic
via
six
port
cities
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system,
port
cities
on
the
western
and
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
railroad.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
i
am
arguing
up
to
this
point,
sir,
that
where
there
are
joint
rates
on
all
commodities
over
a
certain
route,
that
is
our
line
in
this
case
from
the
twin
cities
to
spokane
that
through
routes
exist
for
those
commodities
because
joint
rates,
this
court
has
held,
of
a
necessity
presuppose
through
routes.
the
arrangement
there
is
an
express
arrangement.
the
two
railroads
published
a
tariff.
they
named
joint
rates.
they
hold
themselves
out
then
to
the
public
as
offering
a
true
service.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
yes.
and
export-import
goods
cover
all
conceivable
commodities
that
can
move
in
export
and
import
traffic
which
are
the
same
commodities
that
can
move
in
domestic
traffic.
now,
we
come
to
that
next
point,
sir,
with
this
observation
that
the
commission
then
went
further
and
they
said
between
all
points
where
you
don't
have
the
joint
rates,
routes
are
available
but
the
shipper
will
have
to
pay
a
combination
rate
which
causes
a
higher
charge
and
therefore
the
shippers
are
not
generally
inclined
to
use
that
kind
of
a
route.
now,
if
the
commission
says
that
a
route
is
available,
it
can
only
mean
one
thing,
that
if
the
shipper
wants
the
ship
that
way,
he
can
ship
that
way.
and
if
he
can
ship
that
way,
the
route
is
there.
now,
if
that
--
does
that
mean
then
that
wherever
there
is
a
connection
that
a
shipper
can
move
a
shipment
from
a
point
of
one
railroad
to
the
line
on
another
and
claim
there
is
a
through
route?
section
15
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
says
that
a
shipper
--
that
a
carrier
is
bound
to
accept
the
shipper's
routing
where
the
through
route
is
available
and
if
the
through
route
is
not
available,
then
that
section
imposes
no
obligation
upon
the
carrier
to
accept
the
shipment.
and
so
when
this
commission
in
this
case
said
through
routes
are
available,
excuse
me,
routes
are
available,
if
a
--
where
the
joint
rates
do
not
apply
and
to
all
points
from
the
s.
p.
&
s.
to
all
points
on
the
milwaukee
and
its
connections,
and
if
you
tie
that
together
with
the
joint
rates
that
are
applicable,
at
least
the
only
one
conclusion
that
through
routes
now
exist
over
the
milwaukee's
entire
line
in
spokane
to
the
twin
cities
and
beyond,
and
that
all
the
milwaukee
is
seeking
here
is
not
the
establishment
of
through
routes
but
the
establishment
of
joint
rates
applicable
thereto.
and
if
our
position
is
sound,
section
15
(4)
no
longer
applies
because
section
15
(4)
applies
only
to
the
establishment
of
through
routes.
the
two
principle
cases
which
our
opposition
raised,
as
disputing
our
position,
is
the
thompson
case.
in
that
case,
they
sought
routes
from
points
on
the
missouri
pacific
out
in
kansas
to
omaha
and
grain
and
grain
products.
they
wanted
the
traffic
to
move
from
the
missouri
pacific
origins
to
concordia,
kansas
and
then
go
in
omaha
or
the
chicago
burlington
in
quincy
railroad.
the
evidence
did
not
show
that
there
was
any
traffic
currently
being
interchanged
to
concordia.
in
the
present
case,
the
record
shows
that
513
cars
a
year
are
interchanged
by
the
milwaukee
railroad
and
this
s.
p.
&
s.
at
spokane
indicating
that
the
arrangement
for
the
interchanged
of
grade
at
that
point
is
very
much
in
existence.
in
the
thompson
case,
there
were
no
joint
rates
applicable
over
the
cbmq's
line
to
omaha.
in
our
case,
i
have
outlined
the
joint
rates
which
do
apply
all
the
way
from
spokane
to
the
twin
cities,
to
points
beyond
the
twin
cities
and
also
to
points
on
the
connections
of
the
milwaukee
railroad.
finally,
there
was
no
finding
in
the
thompson
case
that
routes
were
avail
--
available
to
a
shipper,
a
combination
rate
should
he
wish
to
ship
to
omaha.
and
the
most
recent
through
route
case
which
was
the
ogden
gateway
case,
the
rio
grande
versus
the
union
pacific
railroad
involved
a
request
for
through
routes
to
be
established
in
connection
with
the
union
pacific
from
the
northwest
to
ogden,
utah
then
to
rio
grande
to
points
in
colorado
and
ends
connections
beyond
and
in
the
reverse
direction.
in
that
case,
only
55
carloads
a
traffic
a
year
were
moving
via
the
ogden
gateway.
and
the
commission,
they
move
at
combination
rates.
the
commission
said
that
those
are
in
the
nature
of
isolated
shipments
and
cannot
be
construed
as
indicating
a
holding
out
by
the
parties
to
offer
through
transportation.
here,
the
interchanges,
513
cars
or
10
times
as
much.
the
court
in
the
union
pacific,
rio
grande
case
pointed
out
that
the
union
pacific
and
the
rio
grande
had
--
had
engaged
in
a
long
struggle
to
keep
close
at
ogden
gateway
and
the
rio
grande
was
trying
to
get
it
open.
in
this
case,
that
struggle
hasn't
manifested
itself.
the
s.
p.
&
s.
has
entered
into
us
--
into
joint
rates
with
us
voluntarily
as
i
have
pointed
out
by
spokane,
and
the
traffic
does
move
via
that
gateway.
the
rio
grande
case
--
this
court
and
the
commission
found
that
because
joint
rates
presently
existed
on
sheep
and
goats
over
the
rio
grande's
route
that
there
were
therefore
through
routes
in
existence
on
sheep
and
goats.
here,
we
show
the
joint
rates
existing
on
all
commodities
moving
an
export-import
traffic
and
on
lumber
and
forest
products
in
particular
over
the
length
of
our
lines,
spokane
to
the
twin
cities
and
to
certain
points
beyond.
so,
we
point
out
that
our
case
offers
an
entirely
different
situation
and
involved
into
the
thompson
or
the
rio
grande
case.
and
in
the
virginia
railroad
case,
which
i
pointed
out
earlier,
says
that
even
if
the
rates
are
too
high
a
level
to
move
the
traffic,
if
the
shipper
can
ship
that
way
and
these
carriers
offer
service
that
way,
if
the
shipper
wants
to
use
it,
there
are
through
routes
available.
and
in
that
case,
the
combination
rate
was
not
only
admitted
by
the
carrier
to
be
too
high
to
move
the
traffic,
the
counsel
for
the
carrier
said,
"we
not
only
say
they're
too
high,
we
admit
they're
impossible."
and
still,
the
court
was
able
to
find
that
the
through
routes
existed.
and
so
here,
with
the
showing
where
you
made
of
the
joint
rates
applicable,
the
combination
rates
that
are
applicable,
we
feel
strongly
that
the
through
routes
are
presently
there.
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
have
any,
i'd
like
to
save
for
rebuttal.
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
thank
you,
sir.
in
answer
to
some
comments
by
mr.
ginnane,
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
railroad,
an
old
traffic
which
interchanges
with
the
milwaukee
railroad
would
get
the
long
haul.
now,
neither
the
great
northern
nor
the
northern
pacific
now
have
any
short-haul
protection
against
each
other.
every
car
which
the
great
northern
handles
of
s.
p.
&
s.
traffic
is
competitive
with
the
northern
pacific
and
the
northern
pacific
is
now
short-haul.
the
question
is,
can
you
be
half
safe?
and
i
don't
think
that
the
law
contemplates
that
a
railroad
can
reserve
only
the
right
to
be
half
protected
by
section
15
(4).
now,
the
s.
p.
&
s.
is
now
some
little
short
line
like
mr.
rockwood
indicated
that's
a
950
mile
long
railroad.
it's
a
class
one
carrier.
now
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
well,
in
comparing
to
the
milwaukee,
sir
--
i
mean
to
the
burlington,
he
indicated
that
i
thought
that
the
burlington
was
a
great
big
railroad,
the
s.
p.
&
s.
is
just
a
little
one.
and
--
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
the
burlington
is
much
longer
but
i'm
saying
the
s.
p.
&
s.
is
not
just
a
branch
line
railroad,
sir.
and
it's
a
mainline
type
of
an
operation
over
which
through
passenger
runs
as
well
as
free
trade.
in
the
rio
grande
case,
i
would
like
to
point
out
if
i
may,
that
there
were
through
routes
found
on
sheep
and
goats,
both
by
the
commission
and
by
this
court
notwithstanding
those
through
routes
were
commercially
closed.
joint
rates
supplied
on
those
commodities
but
they
were
hire
and
the
rates
via
the
union
pacific
and
the
record
show
there
was
no
movement
as
sheep
and
goats
via
the
rio
grande,
and
i
will
stand
on
that
statement.
in
the
louisville
and
nashville
case
referred
to
by
mr.
ginnane,
it
was
a
5-to-4
decision.
the
four
dissenters
pointed
out
that
if
this
decision
stood,
it
would
affect
a
grave
miscarriage
and
injustice
and
congress
responded
by
repealing
that
section
of
the
law.
so
i
don't
see
any
conflict
between
the
laws
that
now
exist
and
the
interpretation
which
we
request
to
section
15
(4).
in
the
rochester
case
referred
to
by
justice
frankfurter,
the
lower
court
went
into
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
under
which
the
joint
management
or
control
was
brought
up
and
determined
from
the
legislative
history
that
congress
there
wanted
a
broad
interpretation
given
to
the
meaning
of
the
word
"control".
mr.
raymond
k.
merrill
that
is
right,
sir.
and
i
stand
on
that
argument,
and
we
rely
very
heavily
that
congress
did
not
want
to
apply
a
liberal
definition
to
the
word
"control"
under
15
(4).
that's
all,
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
