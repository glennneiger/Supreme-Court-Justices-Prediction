mr.
fletcher
rockwood
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
--
i
appear
here
for
the
appellee
railroad
companies
who
were
dependents
or
intervening
dependents
in
the
lower
court.
and
the
carriers
principally
involved
are
the
s.
p.
&
s.,
spokane
and
portland
&
seattle
railway
and
its
two
wholly
owned
subsidiaries,
oregon
trunk
and
oregon
electric
and
the
great
northern
and
northern
pacific,
which
equally
owned
all
the
bonds
and
stock
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
the
major
issue
in
this
case
of
course
arises
under
section
15
(4).
that
is,
whether
within
the
meaning
of
that
section,
two
joint
owners
can
sole
exercise
control
over
a
jointly
owned
subsidiary
to
entitle
both
to
the
protection
against
short-hauling.
mr.
ginnane
has
argued
that.
i
am
not
going
to
repeat
or
elaborate
to
any
extent
on
the
argument
that
we
have
on
our
brief.
i
do
want
to
simply
say
to
the
court
that
when
congress
reenacted
the
section
15
(4)
in
the
transportation
act
of
1940,
the
legislative
history
shows
that
they
desire
to
make
no
change
in
the
interpretation
then
given
to
the
word
control
in
section
15
(4).
and
so
in
our
brief,
we
have
made
or
rather
elaborate
statement
of
the
history
of
the
interpretation
of
the
words
common
management
or
control
in
section
15
(4)
and
in
section
15
(1)
cases
wherein
the
commission
was
prescribing
reasonable
rates
and
we
have
asserted
that
the
interpretation
should
be
uniformed
in
the
administration
of
all
courses
of
section
15
to
prevent
inconsistency.
the
principal
issue
that
i
want
to
talk
about
is
the
existence
of
through
routes
and
mr.
justice
whittaker
asked
what
a
through
route
was.
a
through
route
is
an
arrangement
expressed
or
implied
between
two
carriers
whereby
they
will
join
in
the
transportation
of
a
property
from
point
a
on
railroad
a
to
point
b
on
railroad
b.
now,
that
maybe
subject
to
a
joint
through
writ
published
by
the
term
--
parties
in
their
tariffs.
or,
a
through
route
may
exist
where
the
rate
applicable
over
the
through
route
for
the
through
transportation
is
a
combination
of
the
local
routes,
local
rates
of
each
of
the
two
carriers
to
and
from
the
junction
point.
in
the
usual
case
of
the
through
routes
exist
by
reason
of
a
publication
by
carriers
in
their
tariffs
of
a
specific
statement
of
what
commodity
will
be
carried
from
where
to
where
at
what
rate.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
that
is
a
through
route.
that
is
a
holding
out,
if
they
so
publish
the
tariff.
that's
a
holding
out.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
no,
i
don't
say
it.
i
didn't
say
a
physical
connection
would
establish
a
through
route.
a
through
route
may
exist
over
a
route
where
the
applicable
rates
are
a
combination
of
locals
and
that
comes
into
existence
by
reason
of
a
practice
of
the
carriers
in
holding
themselves
out
as
this
court
has
said
in
two
cases
as
being
prepared
to
give
the
through
transportation
service.
but
if
there
is
no
such
holding
out,
the
mere
physical
track
connections
do
not
create
a
through
route.
in
this
case,
mr.
merrill
points
to
the
language
of
the
commission
where
the
commission
did
say
that
routes
are
available
via
the
milwaukee
from
s.
--
to
and
from
s.
p.
&
s.
points
via
spokane,
but
they
are
not
used
because
the
combination
of
rate
is
too
high
and
they
are
commercially
closed.
the
commission
did
say
that,
but
in
the
very
next
paragraph,
commission
went
on
to
say,
but
these
are
not
through
routes,
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(3)
and
section
15
(4).
they
are
physical
routes,
but
not
through
routes
because
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
carriers
held
themselves
out
as
being
prepared
to
give
through
service
over
that
route,
s.
p.
&
s.
milwaukee
via
spokane.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
well,
that's
right.
holding
themselves
out
and
being
prepared
to
give
the
through
service.
now
in
this
case,
the
carriers,
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
the
milwaukee
did
join
in
several
joint
through
rates.
the
one
which
carried
the
most
traffic
was
a
joint
through
rate
on
petroleum
products
from
a
point
on
the
s.
p.
&
s.
east
pasco,
washington,
which
incidentally
is
the
terminal
of
salt
lake
pipeline
where
petroleum
products
originate
for
rail
movement
to
seven
main
stations
on
the
milwaukee
in
idaho
and
washington.
now,
those
are
through
routes
on
petroleum
products
from
east
pasco
to
those
particular
points.
but
those
petroleum
rates
are
not
evidence
of
existence
of
through
rates
on
any
other
commodities
or
between
any
other
points
on
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system.
and
that
follows,
if
your
honors
please
from
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
thompson
case.
there,
there
were
physical
track
connections
between
the
burlington
and
the
missouri
pacific
at
concordia,
kansas
and
there
were
through
routes.
the
carriers
held
themselves
out
as
being
prepared
to
give
through
transportation
service
from
points
on
the
missouri
pacific,
west
of
their
junction
to
the
junction
and
to
points
on
the
burlington,
short
of
omaha.
and
the
court
specifically
held
that
the
evidence
--
that
the
existence
of
though
routes
to
point
short
of
omaha
was
not
evidence
of
the
existence
of
through
routes
to
omaha.
and
that
is
the
situation
here
with
respect
to
every
one
of
these
through
routes
which
do
exist
by
reason
of
tariffs
published
and
contained
in
the
appendix
b
of
the
commission's
report.
lumber,
yes,
we
have
through
routes
on
lumber
from
s.
p.
&
s.
origins
to
local
points
on
the
milwaukee,
east
of
spokane,
but
not
two
points
on
connections
to
milwaukee.
they
have
to
stop
at
local
points
on
the
--
on
the
milwaukee.
now,
that's
exactly
the
same
situation
which
existed
in
the
denver
and
rio
grande
case
where
in
this
court
affirmed
the
order
of
the
commission
which
was
based
on
the
finding
that
through
routes
did
not
exist.
there
were
in
the
rio
grande
case,
through
routes
published
on
lumber
from
union
pacific
origins
in
the
northwest
via
ogden
to
local
points
on
the
rio
grande,
but
not
to
the
eastern
termini
of
the
rio
grande
or
not
beyond
the
eastern
termini
of
the
rio
grande
of
so-called
common
points,
colorado
common
points.
and
not
--
they
did
not
apply
to
destinations
on
connections
of
the
rio
grande,
east
of
colorado
common
points
and
the
commission
found
that
there
were
no
through
routes
except
on
sheep
and
goats
and
that
lumber.
and
this
court
affirmed
the
finding
on
the
basis
of
the
thompson
case
and
reiterated
the
test
in
the
thompson
case
of
holding
out
as
being
prepared
to
give
transportation.
now,
the
milwaukee
relies
on
the
virginian
case.
in
the
virginian
case,
the
court
--
the
commission
found
that
through
routes
existed.
how
they
came
into
existence
or
what
they
were,
i
don't
know,
except
that
only
combination
rates
applied
over
the
virginian
and
its
connections
to
the
west.
but
through
routes
existed
and
relief
was
not
sought
under
section
15
(3)
of
the
act
under
which
the
commission
has
a
power
to
establish
new
routes
because
as
the
court
said,
through
routes
to
the
west
were
already
in
existence
and
there
were
through
rates
by
combination.
now,
the
virginian
case
is
not
applicable
here
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
court
in
the
thompson
case
where
they
said
in
a
footnote,
virginian
railroad
against
united
states
is
in
opposite
since
through
routes
were
found
to
be
in
existence
but
commercially
closed
solely
because
the
unreasonable
discriminatory
charges
charged
by
the
virginian
over
its
portion
of
the
route.
so
that
the
virginian
case
is
not
authority
for
a
finding
--
to
support
a
finding
that
any
through
routes
exist
except
those
which
are
subject
to
the
published
through
rates
in
which
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
the
milwaukee
already
joined
of
which
petroleum
is
the
outstanding
example
and
the
lumber
is
probably
the
next
important.
i
want
to
comment
just
for
a
moment
on
these
export
and
import
rates.
yes,
we
have
a
full
line
of
export
and
import
rates
with
the
milwaukee,
but
they
apply
only
to
and
from
six
tidewater
ports
on
the
willamette
and
columbia
rivers
of
--
stations
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
do
not
apply
to
or
from
any
other
points.
furthermore,
they
apply
only
on
commodities
which
are
to
be
exported-imported
having
the
--
those
traffic
characteristics.
it's
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
thompson
case.
those
rates
certainly
are
not
evidence
to
the
existence
of
rates
on
--
routes
on
lumber
from
a
point
such
as
eugene,
oregon,
125
miles
away
from
tidewater.
they
are
evidence
only
of
through
routes
on
traffic
to
and
from
those
tidewater
ports
and
having
those
particular
characteristics.
the
milwaukee
has
made
quite
a
point
of
the
fact
that
513
cars
were
interchanged
in
the
year
1952
at
spokane
between
the
milwaukee
and
the
s.
p.
&
s.
of
those
substantially
500
cars
were
eastbound,
lumber
and
petroleum
products,
livestock
on
which
they
are
joint
through
rates
as
included
in
the
appendix
b.
there
were
less
than
15
cars
as
i
remember
which
moved
westbound
and
there
were
a
variety
of
commodities.
now,
except
for
few
cars
of
livestock,
i
--
we
can't
identify
as
the
record
now
stands.
what
rates
were
charged
on
those
10
or
15
cars?
but
even
though
they
moved
on
combination
rates
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
did
move
on
the
combination
rates,
it's
exactly
similar
to
the
55
cars
that
trickled
through
and
which
the
commission
in
this
court
found
did
not
justify
acclaiming
of
the
existence
of
the
through
read
--
route
in
the
rio
grande
case.
the
commission
specifically
found
the
record
indicates
that
the
foregoing
513
shipments
moved
on
joint
through
rates.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
traffic,
has
ever
been
solicited
for
routing
via
spokane
over
a
milwaukee
s.
p.
&
s.
route
via
which
a
higher
combination
rate
applied
or
has
ever
moved
over
such
a
route.
now,
that
finding
was
contained
in
the
examiners'
report
and
incidentally,
the
finding
that
the
commission
made
that
no
through
routes
existed
were
in
the
examiner's
report.
the
milwaukee
in
its
exemptions,
the
examiner's
report
did
not
accept
either
of
those
findings.
they
did
attempt
in
a
reply
to
exemptions
by
other
parties
to
raise
the
question
of
the
existence
of
through
routes,
but
the
commission
sustained
our
motion
to
strike
that
portion
of
the
reply
as
improper
at
that
point.
they
raised
the
point
again
of
the
existence
of
through
routes
on
their
petition
for
reconsideration,
which
was
filed
with
the
commission
and
was
denied,
but
never
until
the
brief
of
the
milwaukee
in
this
court
has
had
taken
exemption
to
the
finding
that
the
513
cars
moved
on
joint
through
rates.
now,
they
assert
and
the
secretary
makes
the
same
assertion
that
only
387
cars
moved
on
joint
through
rates.
consequentially,
they
say
that
126
cars
moved
on
a
combination
rate.
the
witness
who
testified
the
300
--
the
particular
387
cars
moved
on
joint
through
rates
did
not
say
that
a
single
car
moved
to
combination
rates
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
where
those
126
cars
came
from,
what
they
cover
or
anything
about
them
at
all
or
what
rates
they
moved
under.
furthermore,
the
inference
that
any
cars
moved
at
combination
rates
is
rebutted
by
the
milwaukee's
own
witnesses.
i
will
not
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
spell
out
that
testimony
in
detail.
it's
in
our
brief.
but,
the
conclusions
that
one
must
draw
from
the
testimony
of
their
witness
nichols
who
presented
exhibit
1
that
mr.
merrill
talked
about
developing
the
513
cars
and
the
testimony
of
their
witness
hettinger
who
presented
their
exhibit
18,
who
developed
this
figure
of
two
and
a
half
million
that
mr.
merrill
talked
about.
inevitably,
supports
the
conclusion
that
those
cars
moved
at
through
rates
for
513
cars.
hettinger
was
attempting
to
develop
what
the
increase
in
the
milwaukee
railway
would
have
been,
have
they
handled
in
long
hauls
spokane
all
the
cars
in
which
they
participated
to
any
extent
in
line
haul
to
and
from
s.
p.
&
s.
points.
there
were
6300
of
them,
most
of
which
they
either
received
or
delivered
to
another
carrier
at
minnesota
transport
to
twin
cities
after
the
northern
lines
got
their
long
haul.
but
there
were
these
513
cars
which
were
interchanged
at
spokane.
as
to
those,
he
said
that
he
estimated
that
there
would
be
no
increase
in
revenue
and
his
words
were,
as
practically
all
of
those
traffic
moved
on
through
rates,
the
revenue
picture
would
be
unchanged.
well
now,
he
meant
when
he
said,
through
rates.
he
meant
joint
through
rates.
he
didn't
mean
combination
rates.
because
if
he
admit
the
term
through
rates
to
include
combination,
then
necessarily
he
would
have
said
that
all
of
them
moved
on
through
rates
and
he
wouldn't
have
qualified
the
statement
at
all.
so
he
said
that
practically
all
of
them
moved
on
joint
through
rates.
the
s.
p.
&
s.
traffic
manager
was
asked
whether
a
shipper
could
move
traffic
over
the
s.
p.
&
s.
,
milwaukee
route
via
spokane
for
which
joint
through
rates
were
not
in
affair.
and
he
said,
we
have
never
had
any
traffic
like
that
offered
to
us
and
i'm
not
going
to
speculate
on
what
we
would
do.
well,
there
is
in
this
case
no
evidence
that
any
of
those
513
cars
moved
to
combination
rates.
there's
no
evidence
that
any
of
them
moved
other
than
at
rates
included
in
tariffs
which
are
listed
in
the
appendix
via
the
commission
decision,
the
through
routes
and
through
rates
actually
existing
admittedly.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
well,
the
significant
so
far
as
the
milwaukee
is
concerned
is
--
they
would
argue
that
that
indicated
a
holding
out
by
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
the
milwaukee
to
give
through
service
on
anything
that
want
to
move
via
the
spokane
route.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
published
tariff.
if
there
is
a
through
route
and
they're
holding
out
and
if
the
applicable
rates
over
the
through
route
are
combination
rates,
each
carrier
publishes
its
own
tariff
with
its
local
rate
from
the
origin
to
the
junction,
from
the
junction
to
the
destination
on
the
second
period.
there
can
be
through
routes.
instantly,
there
appears
on
this
record
that
there
are
some
shipments
which
have
moved
over
portion
of
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
over
the
s.
p.
&
s.
and
the
oregon
trunk
or
over
the
oregon
trunk,
s.
p.
&
s.
and
oregon
electric
or
which
there
were
no
joint
through
rates
published
and
combination
rates
were
applied.
well,
i
don't
think
anybody
would
ever
content
that
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system,
the
three
lines
composing
the
s.
p.
&
s.
system
don't
hold
themselves
out
as
being
prepared
to
give
through
a
service
from
any
point
on
the
system
to
any
other
point
on
the
system.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
don't
believe
--
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
think
the
mere
publication
of
the
through
rates
would
make
that
the
applicable
rate
under
the
tariff.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
under
the
tariffs,
i
should
say
plural.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
the
shipper
just
goes
to
the
initial
carrier
and
builds
it
out
from
a
to
b
and
sometimes
he
inserts
the
rates,
sometimes
he
doesn't.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
not,
no.
no.
if
you
want
to
cut
on
the
joint
rate
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
that
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
in
the
world.
and
i
remember
you
hearing
the
argument
before
your
honors
in
the
rio
grande
case
and
a
great
deal
that
are
i
think
was
devoted
to
the
subject
of
how
the
union
pacific
ever
got
out
from
under
the
through
routes
and
through
rates
which
admittedly
existed
historically
in
the
early
days,
and
just
how
if
you
got
a
through
route
with
applicable
rates
and
combination
rates.
how
you
get
rid
of
that?
i'm
not
quite
sure.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
that's
right,
through
holding
themselves
out
as
being
prepared
to
new
through
transportation
service.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
that's
right.
but
if
there
is
a
through
rate
then
you
can
publish
a
tariff
canceling
the
joint
through
rate
as
it
was
done
in
the
s.
p.
&
s.
case
that
mr.
merrill
cited
where
they
canceled
of
the
rate
via
portland,
the
union
pacific
to
the
denver
and
east
territory.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
absolutely.
and
the
commission's
finding
that
the
through
routes
do
not
exist
will
be
sustained
by
this
court
as
they
were
in
the
rio
grande
case
as
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
the
other
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
oh,
yes.
they
found
that
through
routes
did
not
exist
but
then
in
the
rio
grande
case,
they
proceed
to
order
in
some
additional
through
routes
on
livestock,
fresh
meat
and
vegetables
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
(inaudible)
westbound,
i
remember.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
they
--
yes
sir.
the
order
that
was
made
by
the
commissioner
was
sustained,
but
the
finding
by
the
commission
that
through
routes
did
not
then
exist
except
on
sheep
and
goats,
and
lumber
were
sustained.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
well,
i
think
that
is
true.
in
this
case
whether
or
not
existing
--
there
are
existing
routes.
that's
a
question
of
fact
to
be
decided
by
the
commission
found
by
the
commission.
they
can't
do
it
capriciously.
they
have
to
have
substantial
evidence
to
support
their
finding.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
the
definition
necessarily
of
a
--
of
a
through
route
is
in
general
language
which
this
court
has
placed
shaking
down
to
the
phrase
holding
out.
they
did
that
in
the
thompson
case
and
they
reiterated
them.
they
adhered
to
the
holding
out
test
of
the
thompson
case
in
the
decision
of
rio
grande
case.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
that's
right.
there
are
instances
with
through
routes
where
the
applicable
rates
there
over
are
combination
rates.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
well
that's
right
that
would
have
to
be
included
in
the
tariff
which
would
be
published
through
the
commission.
i'm
not
going
to
talk
about
their
findings
under
15
(3)
to
15
(4)
as
to
necessity
and
desirability
of
additional
through
routes,
and
the
question
of
whether
the
routes
are
needed
in
order
for
to
provide
more
adequate
transportation
under
the
exception
on
15
(4).
because
i
believe
those
are
purely
questions
of
fact
and
we
have
summarized
in
a
degree,
the
testimony
before
their
witness
--
before
the
commission.
the
milwaukee
and
sector
have
not
included
any
adequate
summary
of
the
evidence
before
the
commission
which
would
enable
this
court
to
say
that
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
to
support
the
commission's
finding
in
that
respect.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
common
management
or
control.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
the
common
management
or
control,
the
definition
as
applied
in
15
(4)
cases
comes
from
blackshear
manufacturing
company
which
hasn't
been
mentioned
here
today.
that
was
a
case
wherein
the
commission
was
prescribing
two
scales
of
rates.
one
for
application
over
a
single
line
of
railroad
or
over
the
lines
of
railroads
under
common
management
and
control,
and
the
other
a
higher
scale
for
application
where
there
was
not
common
management
and
control.
and
the
commission
in
defining
its
phrase
in
the
blackshear
case
said
that
the
term
common
management
and
control
is
construed
to
mean
control
of
traffic
policy
through
ownership,
lease
or
otherwise
even
though
separate
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
yes.
control
of
traffic
policy
by
reason
of
ownership,
lease
or
otherwise
control
of
traffic
policy
is
the
important
thing.
now,
ownership,
mere
ownership
is
not
enough.
there's
got
to
be
exercise
of
control
to
traffic
policy
and
we
cite
the
case
in
our
brief,
where
there
was
actual
100%
ownership
of
stock
but
no
control
of
traffic
policy
and
common
management
and
control
within
the
meaning
of
the
blackshear
case
did
not
exist.
now,
when
you
come
to
cases
such
as
the
rochester
case,
there
the
commission
wanted
extensive
powers
so
that
it
could
exercise
its
functions
under
the
sections
of
the
act
to
which
that
definition
was
made
applicable.
but
they
didn't
want
to
extend
that
to
15
(4)
because
if
they
had
extended
to
15
(4),
a
definition
of
control
as
broad
as
it
was
contained
in
the
rochester
case,
that
would
have
curtailed
greatly
the
power
of
the
commission
to
establish
joint
through
rate
--
joint
through
routes
by
reason
of
the
limitations
of
section
15
(4).
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
well,
it
was
de
facto,
that's
true.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
and
they
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
no,
absolutely
not.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
there's
--
no,
i
should
say
no.
there
is
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
it
has
to
be
controlled
by
ownership
lease
or
otherwise
and
what
otherwise
means,
heavens
only
knows.
but
they
have
to
be
in
the
position
to
control
the
traffic
policy.
the
controlling
carrier
has
to
be
in
the
position
to
control
the
traffic
policy
of
the
controlled
carrier.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
that
is
the
definition
and
that's
what's
been
carried
over
in
the
15
(4).
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
exercise
of
--
yes,
controlled
by
traffic
officials,
responsible
traffic
officials
over
the
traffic
policy
of
the
controlled
carrier.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
that's
right.
and
that's
what
the
commission
wanted
with
respect
to
certain
section
of
the
act
but
did
not
want
to
have
within
with
respect
to
15
(4).
i'm
going
to
comment
only
on
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
don't
go
along
with
mr.
merrill
to
say
that
that
disposes
of
the
case.
the
commission
has
still
got
to
make
a
finding
under
15
(3)
that
the
additional
routes
are
necessary
or
desirable
in
the
public
interest.
even
sides
from
all
they
may
find
under
section
15
(4),
they've
still
got
to
make
a
finding
that
the
additional
routes
are
necessary
or
desirable
on
--
in
a
public
interest
under
the
--
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(3).
furthermore,
they
got
to
make
a
finding
different
than
they
did
with
respect
to
a
violation
of
section
3
(1),
they
made
a
very
positive
finding
that
there
was
no
undo
prejudice
or
preference
under
3
(1).
and
furthermore,
they've
got
to
make
a
finding
that
there
is
a
violation
of
section
3
(4),
and
i
--
that's
discrimination
between
carriers.and
i
believe
that
the
commission
will
be
justified
in
finding
no
violation
of
section
3
(4)
even
though
the
northern
lines
and
the
s.
p.
&
s.
did
not
have
a
protection
of
section
15
(4)
against
short-hauling
in
the
light
of
the
--
the
court
held
in
the
louisville-nashville
case.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
yes.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
not
too
many.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
don't
know
of
any
that
are
--
as
large
as
this,
where
a
carrier
with
a
thousand
miles
of
trackage
such
as
the
s.
p.
&
s.
is
under
common
management
and
control
of
another.
there
are
small
lines
like
the
northwestern
pacific
usually
owned
by
the
santa
fe
and
the
southern
pacific.
the
oregon,
california
and
the
eastern,
it's
a
logging
railroad
on
southern
oregon
owned
by
the
great
northern
and
the
southern
pacific.
and
there
are
few
like
that,
but
i
don't
know
of
any
situation
in
the
country.
there
is
one
which
is
not
mentioned
on
the
record
and
that's
the
burlington
which
mr.
merrill
says
it's
owned
by
the
northern
pacific
and
great
northern.
the
facts
of
that
ownership
are
not
shown
in
the
record
but
no
contention
was
ever
made
in
this
case
but
the
burlington
was
under
common
management
and
control
of
the
northern
lines.
the
burlington
is
a
big
railroad
that
runs
its
own
routes.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
think
i
should
say
quite
frankly
that
if
the
commission
is
wrong
and
if
the
lower
court
were
wrong
in
their
interpretation
of
section
15
(4),
probably
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
commission
to
reconsider
further
two
points.
one,
whether
the
routes
are
necessary
or
desirable
public
interest
under
15
(3),
whether
the
15
(4)
issue
removed.
and
second,
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
section
3
(4)
if
we're
not
entitle
too
long
haul
protection
under
section
15
(4).
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
yes
[laughs]
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
--
because
the
commission
has
found
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
well,
the
commission
has
found
that
the
routes
are
not
necessary
desirable
of
the
public
interest
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(3).
the
commission
has
found
that
there
is
no
violation
of
section
3
(4).
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
--
in
all
frankness,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
we
are
wrong
on
15
(4),
and
i
don't
believe
we
are,
the
commission
ought
to
have
another
chance
to
consider
section
3
(4).
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
no,
i
don't
quite
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
--
think
so
because
there
wasn't
--
they
were
--they're
--
frankly
15
(4)
protection
there
because
their
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
--
their
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
yes.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
well
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
i
--
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
they're
not
the
same
as
they
were
in
the
rio
grande
case,
but
i
have
read
your
honor's
dissent
in
the
rio
grande
case.
mr.
fletcher
rockwood
thank
you.
