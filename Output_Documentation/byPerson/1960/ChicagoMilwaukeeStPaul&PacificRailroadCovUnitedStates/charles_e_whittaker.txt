justice
charles
e.
whittaker

suppose
we
dispense
with
the
corporate
form
and
two
competing
independent
railroads
as
partners
build
a
line
or
buy
one
that
extends
as
a
connecting
line,
their
lines
onto
the
state
of
west
coast.
would
in
that
case
this
new
line
be
under
joint
control
or
common
management
of
either?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
that
what
you
mean,
mr.
merrill,
to
argue
that
through
routes
exist
in
all
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
joint
rates,
as
i
understand
you,
apply
through
forest
products
and
to
export-import
goods.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
ginnane,
you
take
time
valid
but
before
you
leave
this
discussion
on
15
(4),
would
you
please
tell
us
what
is
meant
by
this
phrase
through
routes
may
be
exist
independently
of
joint
rates.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
what
does
it
mean
as
used
in
15
(4),
the
phrase
?through
routes?.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
because
the
rate
so.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
isn't
because
there
may
not
be
a
through
route
but
it's
because
there's
no
joint
rate.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
evidently,
this
phrase
through
routes
means
something
more
than
physical
connections.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
merrill
says
that
through
routes
exist
because
derived
the
physical
connections
and
because
joint
rates
do
apply
as
to
some
commodities.
is
he
right
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now,
do
you
agree
with
him
that
through
rates
--
through
routes
do
exist?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
does
--
if
--
is
15
(4)
limited
in
any
way?
it
just
says,
in
establishing
any
set
through
route.
it
deals
only
with
through
routes
doesn't
it,
15
(4)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now
then,
what
does
that
mean,
on
all
commodities
or
on
some
commodities
in
order
for
a
through
route
to
exist?
i
just
don't
believe
i
quite
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
it's
only
commodity
basis,
is
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
a
not
a
physical
thing
at
all.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
what
makes
it
through
route?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
otherwise,
if
all
there
was
required
as
what
you
said
first,
namely,
a
physical
connection,
then
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
is
the
significance
if
it
were
a
fact
that
125
cars
did
move
at
combination
rates?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
there
would
be
no
published
tariff.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
rather
gather
mr.
rockwood
that
what
constitutes
a
through
route
within
the
sense
here
of
15
(4)
is
pretty
much
a
conclusion
of
the
commission,
how
far
wrong
is
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
neither
does
it
seem
to
be
any
direct
pinching
hole
into
which
you
can
categorize
it
either.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
maybe
by
a
publish
tariff
but
it
need
not
be
as
you
say.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
the
burlington
is
much
longer
than
that.
