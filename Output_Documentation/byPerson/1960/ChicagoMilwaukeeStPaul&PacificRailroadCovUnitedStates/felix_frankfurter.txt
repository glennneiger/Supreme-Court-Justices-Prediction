handled
by
the
representatives
as
a

a
duality,
the
two

them
together
or
--
justice

what
happens
then?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
can
do
it
on
its
own.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
commission
make
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
the
volume
of
thing,
giving
the
service
so
that
the
shippers
who
delivers
through
--
the
initial
carrier
doesn't
have
to
bother
about
the
rest
of
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
rockwood,
wasn't
there
exampling
on
file
that
the
i.c.c.
that
the
combination
rates
may
be
used
as
a
joint
rate
over
the
joint
route?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
indication
that
there
is
a
joint
route
or
does
the
shipper
just
go
to
the
initial
carrier
and
find
out
that
there
is
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
the
carrier
wouldn't
capriciously
when
they
have
a
joint
route
and
that
makes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
against
that
very
thing.
wasn't
that
of
some
notifications
to
the
commission?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
through
route
is
established
through
cutting
custom.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
even
loophole
for
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
all
events,
i
think
if
you're
right
or
since
you're
right
that
in
a
hearing
like
this
before
the
commission,
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
a
through
route
to
be
established
as
a
matter
of
traffic
tariff?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
couldn't
be
any
other.
there
couldn't
be
any
other
then
combination
rates
because
if
there
were
--
there
were
joint
rates
that
would
have
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
take
a
minute
to
expand
each
for
me,
the
difference
in
the
application
of
the
conception
of
control
as
this
court
lies
it
down
in
the
(inaudible)
case
as
a
determination
of
fact
and
in
legal
interpretation
(inaudible)
interpretation
of
control
of
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
quite
understand
that
because
in
the
rochester
exception
was
a
de
facto
control.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
de
facto
control,
doesn't
it
have
a
de
facto
control
one
or
by
another
(inaudible)(4)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
--
there
has
to
be
a
legal
relationship.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
management
and
control
as
against
--
as
against
the
power
rochester
case,
like
physical
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
rochester
case,
we
take
care
of
the
--
of
the
de
facto
financial
(inaudible)
without
any
exercise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
is
this
the
situation
of
through
routes
having
this
respective
ownership
and
that
brings
to
the
initial
carrier,
indeed
with
reference
to
your
line
of
situation
or
others
like
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would
--
the
petitioners
say
such
relationship
takes
it
out
of
15
(4),
out
of
15
--
15
(4),
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
how
many
like
situations
are
there,
to
the
railroad
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
too
many.
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
we
--
couldn't
this
court
dig
out
of
the
record
sustaining
the
commission
even
though
15
(4)
goes
out
the
way
it
didn't
(inaudible)
railroad?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
soliciting
your
pressure.
i
just
want
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
why
don't
those
two
findings
--
i
asked
you
--
i'll
ask
you,
it
has
to
be
likely
--
it's
a
different
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
why
wasn't
that
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
don't
mean
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i
have
to
say
is
when
would
you
know
whether
--
all
i
(inaudible)
--
when
would
you
know,
i
think
the
(inaudible)
would
know
what
they
might
do
if
the
record
has
been
different
and
has
been
found
to
be
different
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
accept
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that
case
(inaudible)
bigger
as
it
were
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
urging
that.
i'd
