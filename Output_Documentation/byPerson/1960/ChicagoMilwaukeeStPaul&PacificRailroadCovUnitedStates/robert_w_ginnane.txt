mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
sharing
the
appellees'
time
with
mr.
rockwood,
the
counsel
for
the
appellee
railroads.
we
have
attempted
to
divide
the
argument
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
repetition.
so,
i
would
devote
myself
to
the
question
of
whether
15
(4)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
provides
protection
against
short-hauling
to
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
generally,
this
case
is
very
much
like
the
denver
&
rio
grande
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1956.
in
fact,
we
think
the
denver
&
rio
grande
decision
of
this
court
is
dispositive
as
too
much
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
short-hauling
but
this
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
joint
control
product
we
have
here
--
joint
control
of
s.
p.
&
s.
by
the
two
northern
lines
that
was
not
present
in
the
denver
&
rio
grande
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
two
cases
were
referred
to
by
mr.
merrill,
in
which
the
commission
some
years
ago
held
at
the
st.
louis
terminal
railroad
association,
which
is
owned
jointly
by
14
or
15
trunk
line
railroads,
that
that
joint
ownership
was
not
joint
ownership
and
control
for
the
purposes
of
section
15
(4).
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
closest
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
this
short-haul
exception
had
its
origin
as
counsel
has
stated,
the
mann-elkins
act
of
1910.
sergeant
alton
explained
its
purpose
as
follows
on
the
florida
senate.
he
said,
"the
second
exception
to
the
grant
of
this
power
is
one
of
which
has
always
been
recognized
in
the
transportation
business
of
the
country.
the
role
that
initiates
the
freight
and
starts
it
on
its
movement
in
interstate
commerce
should
not
be
required
where
it
is
a
line
not
unreasonably
long.
the
transports
business
from
its
own
road
of
that
of
a
competitor
especially
when
the
commerce
initiated
by
it
can
be
as
promptly
and
safely
transported
by
its
road
as
by
the
line
of
a
competitor."
specifically,
it's
the
initiating
carrier
to
whom
shippers
look
for
car
supply,
rate
information,
tracing
lost
cars
and
so
on.
at
the
same
time
as
this
court
long
ago
held
in
the
missouri
pacific
case,
protection
against
short-hauling
is
not
restricted
to
the
initiating
carriers.
the
commission
--
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
repeatedly
recommended
to
congress
elimination
or
drastic
modification
of
a
short-hauling
restriction
and
its
power
to
establish
through
rates.
the
various
committee
reports,
which
congressional
committees
have
issued
on
the
subject,
have
not
articulated
specific
reasons
as
to
why
congress
persist
in
maintaining
short-haul
protection.
to
find
those
reasons
at
least
the
only
way
we
can
find
them
is
to
look
to
the
testimony
of
the
object
--
of
the
--
of
the
objecting
railroads
before
the
congressional
committees
objecting
to
the
--
the
elimination
of
short-haul
protection
and
that's
where
we
find
it
we
think.
for
example,
in
1938,
an
officer
of
the
appellant
milwaukee
testified
before
house
interstate
commerce
subcommittee
against
the
bill
which
would
have
repealed
the
short-haul
clause
of
section
15
(4).
and
he
justified
this
short-haul
protection
on
the
following
grounds.
i
like
to
quote
in
briefly.
the
milwaukee
road
operates
from
indiana
to
the
north
pacific
coast.
it
has
many
mainline
secondary
mainlines,
branch
lines,
and
sub
branch
lines,
all
welded
into
one
system
to
serve
the
territory
traverse.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
complete
unit
in
itself
from
the
territory
service,
built
for
the
purpose
of
handling
the
traffic
between
all
points
on
its
lines
where
the
routes
are
not
unreasonably
long
compared
with
other
routes.
investments
made
with
that
purchase
in
view
--
that
purpose
in
view,
equipment
purchase
and
terminal
facilities
built
to
provide
a
complete
transportation
facility.
and
it
is
unclear,
said
milwaukee
in
1938
to
enact
him
to
law
a
requirement
that
will
permit
the
breaking
up
of
this
complete
unit
by
the
insertion
of
other
route
which
would
deprive
it
of
its
long
haul.
and
the
milwaukee
officer
went
on
to
say,
"there
are
but
few
branch
lines
that
are
self-sustainable
and
unless
the
traffic
originating
or
terminating
on
branch
lines
produces
long
main
line
hauls."
it
is
only
a
question
of
time
when
their
burdens
on
other
parts
of
the
line
are
so
great
that
abandonment
becomes
necessary.
this
protection
against
short-hauling
is
available
not
only
to
a
single
carrier,
to
a
single
railroad
but
also
to
any
intermediate
railroad
operated
in
conjunction
and
under
a
common
management
and
control
railway.
for
example
in
this
case,
through
routes
between
s.
p.
&
s.
and
milwaukee
via
--
via
spokane
could
not
short-haul
s.
p.
&
s.
because
s.
p.
&
s.
eastern
terminal
is
at
spokane.
however,
the
commission
found
that
s.
p.
&
s.
is
operated
in
conjunction
with
and
under
common
management
and
control
great
northern
and
northern
pacific.
the
part
is
referred
to
for
convenience
as
the
northern
lines.
and
accordingly,
it
concluded
that
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
were
entitled
to
short-haul
protection
against
the
establishment
of
through
routes
between
s.
p.
&
s.
points
and
milwaukee
via
spokane,
routes
which
with
short-haul
the
northern
lines
by
the
entire
distance
between
spokane
and
minneapolis,
st.
paul.
the
following
facts
and
they
are
essentially
undisputed,
support
the
commission's
conclusion
that
s.
p.
&
s.
is
operated
in
conjunction
with
an
under
common
management
and
control
with
great
northern
and
northern
pacific.
the
northern
lines
built
s.
p.
&
s.
about
1909
and
1910
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
congestion,
avoiding
double
tracking
over
the
cascade
mountains
and
providing
a
road
of
low
grades
along
the
snake
and
columbia
rivers
to
the
west
coast.
they
have
owned
from
the
beginning
in
equal
shares
the
stock
and
the
bounds
of
s.
p.
&
s.
their
presidents
take
turns
alternating
as
president
and
vice
president
of
s.
p.
&
s.
,
and
they
personally
act
upon
the
more
important
matters
involved
in
s.
p.
&
s.
s.
p.
&
s.
depends
substantially
upon
the
northern
lines
for
its
cursive
line.
the
freight
traffic
practices
and
policies
of
s.
p.
&
s.
are
directed
and
controlled
jointly
by
the
traffic
departments
of
northern
lines,
while
s.
p.
&
s.
enjoys
consultable
autonomy
in
local
rate
matters.
its
rates
and
practices
relating
to
the
long
haul
transcontinental
traffic,
which
is
what
this
intercarrier
fight
is
about,
are
handled
for
it
by
representatives
of
the
two
northern
lines
and
it
has
always
for
the
50
years
that
--
that
s.
p.
&
s.
has
been
in
existence.
it
has
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes,
sir.
and
in
effect
as
partners.
they
don't
always
agree
as
the
helix
case
shows,
but
the
one
thing
they
have
agreed
at
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
(inaudible)
but
one
thing
that's
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
in
one
category
of
rate
matters,
i
forgot
how
to
describe
it.
so,
intermediate
between
local
rates
and
transcontinental,
if
the
--
the
partners
disagree
s.
p.
&
s.
can
go
ahead
on
its
own.
but
one
thing
that
the
partners
--
the
northern
lines
had
always
agreed
on
since
1910
is
to
preserve
for
themselves
the
long
hauls
on
traffic
originating
or
terminating
on
s.
p.
&
s.
points.
in
this
policy,
the
result
of
this
policy
is
shown
in
the
fact
that
in
1952,
milwaukee
interchanged
513
carloads
at
spokane
with
s.
p.
&
s.,
while
in
northern
lines
were
interchanging
54,000
cars.
that's
the
policy
since
1910
and
that's
how
effective
it
has
--
it
has
been.
so
with
that,
the
commission's
finding
that
the
traffic
policy
of
s.
p.
&
s.
is
controlled
by
its
joint
parents,
the
northern
lines
is
supported
by
ample
evidence.
it's
scarcely
disputed
in
view
of
the
figures
as
to
interchange.
now,
we
suggest
that
the
great
northern
alone
owned
s.
p.
&
s.
and
controlled
its
traffic
policy
that
will
be
admitted
that
the
two
carriers
would
be
operating
in
conjunction
under
common
management
and
control,
so
that
both
will
be
treated
as
a
unit
for
the
purpose
of
short-haul
protection
under
section
15
(4).
that
would
be
same
thing
if
northern
pacific
alone
owned
and
controlled
s.
p.
&
s.
in
our
principle
contention
here,
is
that
the
purposes
of
section
15
(4)
requires
that
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
as
joint
owners
and
jointly
controlling
s.
--
s.
p.
&
s.
traffic
policy
are
likewise
entitled
to
--
to
protection
against
short-hauling,
the
same
protection
against
short-hauling
that
a
single
owner
admittedly
would
get.
well
again,
that
purpose
is
to
provide
protection
against
short-hauling
for
railroad
facilities
which
even
have
owned
by
different
carrier
corporations
are
operated
as
a
unit
in
performing
transportation
service.
again,
if
each
of
the
northern
lines
had
financed,
built
and
control
as
separate
railroad
from
spokane
to
the
coast,
each
would
be
entitled
a
short-haul
protection
and
traffic
to
and
from
points
on
its
separately
owned
and
separately
controlled
route.
here,
it
seems
to
us
clear
from
the
history
of
the
whole
matter.
for
obvious
reasons
of
economy,
the
two
northern
lines
jointly
built
the
s.
p.
&
s.
to
enable
them
to
provide
better
transportation
service.
then
we
submit
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
that
investment
for
their
reasons
which
were
so
well
stated
by
milwaukee's
officer
testifying
in
--
in
favor
of
short-haul
protection
in
1938.
now,
the
briefs
of
the
rail
--
of
the
railroad
parties,
appellants
and
appellees
have
contained
some
dispute
as
to
the
amount
of
the
northern
lines
investment
in
s.
p.
&
s.
i
don't
propose
to
go
into
that
because
by
any
measurement,
the
investment
is
substantial
millions.
that
investment
has
not
paid
off
in
cash.
it
has
paid
off
substantially
in
traffic
originating
on
or
destined
two
points
on
the
s.
p.
&
s.
traffic
which
in
1953
produced
$22
million
in
freight
revenues
for
the
northern
lines.
now,
as
milwaukee
testified
in
1938
before
the
house
committee,
unless
the
short
branch
lines
produce
long
mainline
hauls.
their
abandonment
may
become
necessary.
it's
obvious
that
only
a
parent
or
parents
will
get
the
long
haul
generated
by
branch
lines,
that
will
they
willing
will
have
an
interest
in
continuing
to
absorb
the
loses
on
the
branch
line
operations
as
such.
here,
the
northern
lines
built
s.
p.
&
s.
they
have
absorbed
its
losses.
their
pay
off
in
this
investment
as
in
any
carriers'
investment
in
branch
lines
lies
only
in
the
protection
of
their
long
haul
and
traffic
which
originates
on
--
on
s.
p.
&
s.
again,
we
think
that
this
principle
question
in
the
case
whether
the
northern
lines
are
entitled
protection
against
short-hauling
should
be
determined
not
in
terms
of
a
grammatical
construction
of
a
statute
but
in
terms
of
a
congressional
purpose
in
providing
the
short-haul
protection.
now,
the
appellants
contend
that
the
short-haul
provision
of
section
15
(4)
should
be
given
a
narrow
construction
as
an
exception
to
remedial
legislation
by
this
15
(3),
which
empowers
the
commission
to
establish
through
routes
for
carriers
which
have
not
voluntarily
done
so.
well,
historically
that
will
be
an
--
an
appealing
position
to
the
--
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
but
every
--
but
this
court
has
re
--
through
the
years
has
rejected
every
attempt
by
the
commission
to
place
such
a
restrictive
interpretation
on
the
short-haul
provisions
of
section
15
(4).
whenever
the
commission
has
moved
toward
requiring
open
ruling
as
between
carriers,
this
court
has
regularly
compelled
to
the
commission
to
comply
the
congressional
view
that
the
national
interest
requires
the
protection
of
railroads
against
being
short-hauled.
historically,
as
i
say,
the
commission
at
times
has
been
implying
to
take
about
the
same
position
of
this
--
of
these
appellants,
hostility
to
a
short-haul
protection
favoring
open
routing.
congress
--
and
this
--
congress
has
refused
to
go
along
with
repeated
recommendations,
relax
the
short-haul
protection
or
to
eliminate
it
and
this
court
has
insisted
that
the
commission
honor
the
congressional
purposes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
let
me
start
back
a
little
bit.
to
the
extent
that
through
routes
exist,
shippers
have
a
statutory
right
to
select
which
route
shall
be
used
for
their
tracking.
and
when
shippers
have
that
right,
that
means
all
carriers
participating
in
any
available
route
are
in
a
position
to
solicit
shippers
to
route
the
traffic
via
the
particular
carrier.
in
my
absence
of
a
through
route,
say
as
in
this
case
from
s.
p.
&
s.
points
through
spokane
to
the
east,
there's
no
point
in
milwaukee
trying
to
solicit
the
shippers
and
the
s.
p.
&
s.
to
route
the
traffic
via
milwaukee,
they
can't
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
can't.
because
they
can't.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
except
--
except
that
they're
profitably
high
combination
rates.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right.
the
commission
found
that
the
rates
are
commercially
closed
in
the
sense
of
which
have
found
the
routes
commercially
closed
in
the
ogden
gateway
case,
the
rio
grande
case.
through
routes
in
the
sense
that
they
are
perfectly
adequate
facilities
at
spokane
for
the
physical
interchange
of
cars
between
s.
p.
&
s.
and
milwaukee,
no
question
about
it.
that's
used
for
many
carloads,
say
of
number
of
year,
which
moved
through
spokane
to
local
points
on
milwaukee.
that
is
the
points
which
are
served
only
by
milwaukee.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
as
this
court
so
held
in
the
thompson
case,
which
is
one
of
the
--
which
is
one
the
commission's
ventures
toward
open
routing
and
the
commission
on
effect
was
taking
the
position.
well,
there
are
some
routes
on
a
few
commodities
to
a
few
points
and
their
good
interchanged
facilities.
therefore,
the
interchange
point
is
open.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
oh
yes
on
some
commodities.
joint
rates
exist
on
export
and
import
traffic
and
of
course,
the
principal
item
is
lumber.
that's
what
this
fight
is
over,
is
lumber
eastbound
primarily
and
their
joint
rates
on
lumbar
moving
eastbound
to
point
served
by
milwaukee.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
only
on
certain
movements
of
certain
commodities.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
right
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
we
think
the
law
is
clear
under
the
thompson
case
and
the
rio
grande
case
that
through
routes
exist
as
to
particular
commodities,
not
as
the
commodities
as
a
whole
necessarily.
there
are
cases,
for
example,
in
which
the
commission
has
established
a
through
route
and
joint
rates
over
that
route
for
a
single
commodity
such
as
grain,
wheat
or
corn.
in
the
ogden
gateway
case,
the
commission
found
that
there
were
an
existence
through
routes
on
one
or
two
commodities
such
as
goats
and
it
found
a
need
for
establishing
through
routes
on
a
few
other
commodities.
but
apart
from
that,
through
routes
did
not
exist,
only
theoretically.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
a
commodity
basis
and
an
origin
on
destination
basis.
in
the
thompson
case
--
mr.

no,
sir,
it's
a
commercial
thing.
we're
talking
about
commercial
routes,
not
physical
routes.
the
appellants
rely
strongly
upon
two
commission
decisions
as
holding
that
joint
control
by
two
or
more
railroads.
it
cannot
constitute
control
within
the
meaning
of
section
15
(4).
these
cases
are
discussed
in
all
three
briefs.
there's
absorption
of
switching
charges
and
manufacturers
railway
company.
in
both
cases,
the
commission
held
that
the
terminal
railroad
association
of
st.
louis,
which
is
owned
by
15
trunk
lines
which
served
st.
louis,
was
not
operated
in
conjunction
of
under
a
common
management
and
control
for
the
purposes
of
section
15
(4).
i
feel
obliged
to
concede
with
the
court
below
that
these
two
decisions
as
the
court
below
put
it
due
to
their
very
short
treatment
of
the
issue
of
common
management
and
control
and
because
of
the
very
large
number
of
participants
are
not
persuasive
this
issue.
but
we
think
there's
--
that
there's
a
clear
practical
distinction
in
terms
of
the
purposes
of
section
15
(4),
between
the
affirmative
type
of
control
of
s.
p.
&
s.
traffic
policy
which
is
exercised
by
great
northern
and
northern
pacific
as
it
joint
owners.
and
control
diluted
between
14
or
15
owners
of
a
terminal
railroad
from
which
in
reality,
they
have
no
right
to
expect
nothing
more
than
--
anything
more
than
neutrality
and
treatment.
that's
what
the
owners
of
the
terminal
railroad
by
enlarge
expect,
neutrality
in
the
handling
of
the
cars
in
the
terminal
district.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no.
i
regret
to
say
the
commission
did
not
discuss
these
two
cases
in
its
report
in
this
case.

they're

absorption
of
switching
charges
in
157
i.c.c.
and
manufacturer's
railway
company.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
at
the
top
of
page
47
of
the
appellee
railroad's
brief.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that's
the
blue
brief.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
now,
the
appellant's
attached
great
weight
to
a
grammatical
analysis
of
section
15
(4).
and
they
urged
that
the
language
against
short-hauling
is
in
the
singular
and
it
applies
only
to
a
railroad
and
to
a
railroad
operated
in
conjunction
and
under
common
management
and
control
of
the
first
railroad.
and
we
think
that
argument
is
fully
answered
by
this
court's
decision
in
louisville
and
nashville
railroad
v.
united
states
in
242
u.s.
decided
by
this
court
in
1960.
that
case
involves
the
former
section
3,
paragraph
(3)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
then
provided
that
every
common
carrier
shall
not
discriminate
in
their
rates
and
charges
between
such
connecting
lines,
but
this
shall
not
be
construed
as
requiring
any
such
common
carrier
to
give
the
use
of
its
tracks
or
terminal
facilities
to
another
carrier
engaged
in
like
business.
well,
you
see
such
carrier,
its
tracks
that
that
in
--
in
the
old
section
13
(3)
that
imported
the
singular
too.
now,
that
provision
is
rather
germane
to
section
15
(4)
because
both
deal
with
the
competitive
relationships
between
railroad
carriers.
in
that
case,
the
louisville
and
nashville
case,
the
question
that
--
louisville
and
nashville,
and
nashville,
chattanooga
and
st.
louis
railroad,
which
jointly
owned
the
nashville
terminal
railroad
whether
they
were
discriminating
against
tennessee
central
by
requiring
their
terminal
company
to
switch
cars
for
them,
but
--
by
prohibiting
their
terminal
company
from
switching
cars
for
tennessee
central.
the
commission
had
found
that
difference
in
treatment
toward
tennessee
central
to
be
unjust
discrimination.
this
court
disagreed,
setting
aside
the
commission's
order.
this
court
stated
that
what
one
carrier
admittedly
can
do
by
refusing
to
switch
for
another
over
its
terminal
fact,
said
the
court,
"we
can
see
that
what
is
true
of
one
owner
would
be
equally
true
of
two
joint
owners."
so
we
submit
that
the
l.&
n.
decision
stands
for
the
same
proposition
which
indeed
we
find
in
the
first
section
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1
--
section
1
of
title
1
that
whether
statutory
language
phrased
in
a
singular
should
be
read
to
include
the
plural,
it
depends
upon
the
purpose
of
the
particular
statute
involved.
but
we
think
the
l.&
n.
case
stands
for
a
bit
more
than
that.
we
think
it
stands
for
the
principle
that
two
joint
owners
of
a
railroad
can
invoke
the
same
protection
against
the
competition
of
other
carriers
which
the
act
provides
for
a
single
owner.
in
the
l.&
n.
case,
two
joint
owners
of
a
terminal
were
entitled
to
the
protection
of
the
former
section
3
(3)
against
allowing
use
of
their
terminal
facilities
by
another
carrier.
and
here,
by
what
we
think
is
the
closest
of
analogies,
the
two
northern
lines
which
owned
s.
p.
&
s.
and
control
its
traffic
policy
should
we
submit
the
entitle
to
the
protection
against
short-hauling,
which
a
single
owner
admittedly
would
enjoy.
thank
you.
