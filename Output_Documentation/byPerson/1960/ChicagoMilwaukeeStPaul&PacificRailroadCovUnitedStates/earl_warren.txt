chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
challenge
the
findings
of
the
commission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
do?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
have
come
to
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
your
first
issue,
then
are
all
the
other
--
other
things
in
the
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
understood
you
that
there
is
no
case,
however,
where
--
where
each
line
owns
half
of
the
stock.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
quite
well,
either
--
either
of
them
would
be
minority
owners,
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
there
would
be
no
difference
at
all
between
the
case
where
two
owned
50%
and
the
case
where,
let's
say,
two
of
them
together
owned
51%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
would
say
there
would
be
no
difference
at
all
between
the
two
cases.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may,
mr.
merrill.
mr.
ginnane.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rockwood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
mr.
merrill,
you
have
about
six
minutes,
will
you
finish
with
the
case
this
afternoon?
