justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
wirin
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
moya
and
baldonado
first
pleaded
guilty,
did
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
mrs.
duncan
was
tried
and
she
was
--
there
were
witnesses
against
her,
were
there
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
her
trial,
her
first
trial
was
on
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
followed
as
i
understand
it
before
the
same
jury
that
determined
her
guilt
another
trial
as
to
sentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
long
after
the
determination
by
that
jury
of
the
death
sentence
for
her
was
the
baldonado
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
was,
of
course,
not
a
trial
or
guilt
or
innocence,
he
pleaded
guilty,
it
was
only
to
determine
sentence,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
april
6.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
long
did
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
moya?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
was
--
was
it
common
to
all
four
proceedings,
the
question
of
the
prosecutor's
conduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
common
--
that
was
also
an
issue
in
the
trial
of
mrs.
duncan
on
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
materials
in
all
four
cases
regarding
prosecutor's
conduct
was
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
another
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
he
say
so,
it's
673
before
the
judge,
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
therefore,
he
left
us
with
some
six.
for
preemptory
challenges,
he
said
the
usual
20
because
in
effect,
we
had
to
use
our
preemptories
on
jurors
whom
we
felt
might
believe
the
voir
dire
examination
discloses
a
bias
and
prejudice
against
in
this
respect
and
then
that's
your
point.
he
raised
it
there,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
believe
he
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
also
on
the
record,
mr.
james?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
correctly
read
that
page
136
of
the
moya
record
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
an
opinion?
it
looks
as
though
it's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
it's
not
written
out.
i
know
this
is
an
order
and
so
forth
and
then
goes
on
with
quoted
paragraphs
down
to
the
end
till
the
top
of
138
ending
up
done
this
15th
day
of
january
charles
and
blacksock,
judges
of
superior
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
an
order
which
it
could
be
stated.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
james,
the
last
one
made
reference
to
the
kidnapped
and
murdering?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
before
the
body
was
found.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
--
were
the
three
of
them
arrested?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
$5000.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
quite
clear
with
--
that
last
exhibit
you
referred
to.
what
happen
if
she
--
were
they
--
the
three
of
them
charged
at
this
time
before
the
body
was
found?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
finding
of
the
body
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
december
22nd,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
21st.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
did
--
the
body
was
found
or
baldonado
confessed
then
they
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
did
he
confess?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this,
after
the
indictment
for
conspiracy
murder
in
santa
barbara?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
same
day
apparently
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
succeeding
day.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
james,
have
you
--
have
you
read
anything
conquer
as
yet?
or
perhaps,
i
didn't
hear
it
that
mr.
gustafson
who
was
attributed
to
mr.
gustafson
in
any
of
these
news
articles
that
he
had
turned
over
a
--
any
of
these
confessions
to
the
press?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
haven't
read
anything
of
that
too
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
said
public
--
he
said
the
authorities.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who
identified
the
authorities
was
the
sheriff's
office.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
issue
of
december
22nd.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
--
no.
well,
mr.
wirin
said
so
and
tell
us
he
was
going
to
tell
us
where
but
i
never
heard
him
tell
us
before
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
i
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is
you
hadn't
shown
us
anything
which
indicates
that
the
district
attorney
gave
to
the
press
either
baldonado's
or
moya's
confession.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
james,
i
do
hope
you're
going
to
save
some
time
before
an
issue
of
duncan
case
as
jurors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
your
time
is
running
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
mean
that
jury
was
picked
on
panel
of
83
for
the
duncan
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
that's
the
one
who
(voice
overlap),
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
who's
been
murdered,
but
she
sat
on
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
the
argument
mr.
james,
the
argument
is
that
the
error
in
that
regard,
as
they
saw
it,
deprived
them
because
it
exhausted
their
preemptory
challenges
when
these
three
came
along,
deprived
them
of
their
opportunity
to
use
a
preemptory
challenge
to
get
rid
of
these
three.
they
couldn't,
as
a
matter
of
trial
practice,
challenge
the
cause
because
this
has
been
gotten
involved
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
right
equipment
when
they
started.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
--
the
court
as
i
understand
it,
their
argument
is
that
as
to
the
first
four,
the
court
had
been
wrong
and
would
have
repeated
its
error
as
to
these
three
if
they
had
challenge
the
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
didn't
say
positivity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
james,
what
--
what
significance
do
you
give
to
this
of
673?
i
notice
it's
captioned
under
renewal
of
motion
for
removal
and
change
of
venue
and
denial
error.
but
certainly,
this
point
was
made
to
the
trial
judge,
have
the
presence
of
the
juror,
wasn't
it,
the
middle
of
673?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
right
there
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
--
where
and
tell
us
that
you
were
going
to
tell
us
where
it
is
that
it
appears
that
the
district
attorney
released
a
confession
or
confessions.
where
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
was
after
the
appearance
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
had
occurred
when?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
paper
was
that?
