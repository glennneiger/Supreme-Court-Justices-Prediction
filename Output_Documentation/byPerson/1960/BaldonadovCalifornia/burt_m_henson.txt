mr.
burt
m.
henson
with
my
extent
of
(inaudible)
mr.
burt
m.
henson
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
i
think,
has
to
be
judged
on
the
totality
of
the
facts.
i
feel
that
the
argument
thus
far
may
have
perhaps
narrowed
the
issues
too
much
insofar
as
petitioner
moya
was
concerned
whom
i
represented
in
the
trial
court
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
was
made
on
january
13th,
early
on
the
trial
on
grounds
that
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
could
not
be
held
within
ventura
county,
citing
many
things,
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
of
spanish-mexican
origin,
the
fact
that
the
district
attorney
and
associated
law
enforcement
officers
had
released
a
great
deal
of
information
concerning
the
case.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
i
think
that
we
can
--
they
go
about
it
this
way,
i
don't
mean
to
avoid
it
but
let
me
say
this.
the
district
attorney
in
ventura
county
has
an
investigative
stand.
he
doesn't
rely
solely
upon
the
sheriff's
department.
and
in
one
publication,
this
was
all
before
any
grand
jury
transcript
was
published.
the
district
attorney,
this
is
on
december
22nd
in
the
los
angeles
times,
said,
"i
was
tired
of
waiting
for
somebody
to
do
something
with
this
case
so
i
ordered
my
men
to
question
baldonado."
then
in
another
news
item,
where
it
refers
to
ventura
county
as
a
cal
county,
it
states
that
clarry
--
clarence
"clarry"
henderson
da
investigators
assumed
the
role,
i'm
talking
about
host
for
the
press,
he
arranged
for
photographs
of
the
murder
suspects.
he
provided
names
of
the
witnesses
who
had
appeared
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that
was
december
29.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that
was
exhibit
27
attached
to
affidavit.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
no.
if
i
might
clarify
the
--
it
was
after
the
appearance
before
the
grand
jury
but
--
well,
this
article,
i
guess
read
a
portion
of,
was
describing
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
which
had
occurred
on
december
26th,
but
the
grand
jury
transcript
was
not
published
until
around
december
31st.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that
is,
it
was
transcribed
by
the
court
reporter
and
was
available
for
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that's
correct.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
alright
now,
with
respect
to
the
confessions
then,
december
26th,
1958
issue
of
exhibit
of
star
free
press
with
the
headline,
moya
admits
he
kidnapped
nurse.
the
article
reads,
"moya
reportedly
told
about
the
same
story
as
baldonado
of
the
murder."
gustafson,
the
district
attorney
said,
"the
confession
revealed
the
pair
had
driven
to
the
apartment
of
olga
on
november
18th
and
that
moya
had
gone
to
the
door
telling
the
attractive
nurse
that
her
husband
frank,
from
whom
she
was
estranged,
was
in
the
car
and
wanted
to
talk
to
her."
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that
was
the
ventura
county
star
free
press,
december
22nd,
exhibit
18.
then
it
goes
on,
"baldonado
has
confessed
participation
in
the
kidnap
slaying"
and
says,
"he
was
hired
with
moya
by
mrs.
duncan
according
to
gustafson."
now
if
you
go
back,
this
case
came
alight
around
december
15th
and
this
--
the
first
major
headline
was
lead
sought
in
bizarre
plot.
this
was
december
16th.
the
fake
annulment
charge
jails
three
nurses
in
this.
thereafter,
these
statements
were
made
by
the
district
attorney
or
associated
law
enforcement
officer,
that
is
investigators
working
in
his
office,
under
his
personal
control.
first
of
all,
da
says
man
post
as
lawyer.
this
is
about
winterstein.
and
in
this
article,
gustafson
says,
"i
feel
very
strongly,"
gustafson
said
that
there
might
not
have
been
any
disappearance
that
olga
duncan
had
we'd
been
able
to
move
on
the
case
in
october.
the
next
day,
december
19th,
key
witness
gives
da
valuable
information.this
was
star
free
press
exhibit
14.
and
in
this,
the
district
attorney
says
preferring
to
mrs.
duncan,
"she
has
been
through
enough
annulment
proceedings
to
have
known
that
what
she
obtained
here
august
7th,
was
not
a
legal
annulment."
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
the
first
change
of
venue
hearing
in
january,
he
made
one
--
made
a
reply
affidavit
denying
that
he
had
made
this
one
statement
that
mr.
james
talked
about.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
no.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that's
right.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
others
made
a
denial
of
the
statement.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
well,
as
mr.
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
in
my
motion.
of
course
moya
made
two
motions.
one
motion
in
january,
another
motion
for
change
of
venue
in
april
and
in
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
at
april,
there
was
no
counter
affidavit,
no
counter
motion
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
we
can
--
page
16
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
of
moya's,
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
there
--
there
were
other
affidavits
including
a
justice
court
judge,
three
attorneys,
and
two
ministers
in
addition
to
mind
verifying
prejudice.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes,
sir.
on
the
bottom
of
page
16,
a
client
believes
and
they're
on
alleges
that
there
is
widespread
and
deep-seated
prejudice
against
the
defendants
and
the
above
and
titled
case.
client
believes
and
thereon
alleges
that
a
primary
reason
for
the
existing
prejudice,
this
is
the
fact
that
certain
public
officials
made
certain
public
statements
concerning
above
and
titled
case.
and
going
on
some
high
ranking
public
officials
publicly
expressed
their
opinions
concerning
the
case,
other
public
officers
released
information
to
the
press
and
other
public
media
concerning
the
investigation.
many
of
such
statements
were
made
before
any
legal
tribunal
had
heard
any
evidence.
many
of
such
statements
divulge
information
which
would
not
have
in
any
way
constituted
legal
evidence
in
a
trial.
the
statements
of
opinion
published
would
probably
have
been
classified
as
prejudicial
misconduct
as
stated
in
a
court
law,
then
i
go
on
and
recite
roy
gustafson,
the
duly
elected
acting
district
attorney
served
in
that
capacity
for
approximately
eight
years.
then
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
your
honor,
following
paragraph
and
of
december
22nd,
1958,
a
copy
of
which
the
test
of
roy
gustafson
cause
to
be
published
a
statement
which
contained
among
other
matters
that
follow
in
that
statement.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that
was
admitted.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
a
number
of
--
that
is
many
of
the
individual
statements
were
not
set
forth
in
the
affidavit
but
were
contained
in
the
existence
which
i
was
about
to
recite
to
the
court
but
i'm
not
able
to
do
so
by
that
part.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
would
like
to
just
go
on
here
if
i
might
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
--
say
anytime
preparing
an
affidavit
without
making
it
too
long,
but
we
did
cite
some
of
the
things
such
as
he
did
state
in
the
--
in
his
interview
with
marvin
sasona,
the
describing
reasons
why
a
death
penalty
should
be
applied
here.
he
had
said
that
moya
had
been
using
marijuana
when
he
was
arrested,
which
was
false
and
which
he
did
deny
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
he
denied
making
that
statement.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
then
the
statement
now,
at
further
on
down
page
19
headline,
"heart
attack
sends
mrs.
duncan
to
hospital."
district
attorney
roy
gustafson
this
morning
said
that
mrs.
duncan's
illness
may
have
been
real
but
added
that,
this
is
a
trick
used
by
many
persons
in
jail
in
a
serious
charge.
it
is
known
as
suspects
fake
illnesses
to
get
into
a
hospital
where
there's
a
chance
to
escape.
further
on
down,
santa
barbara
police
lieutenant
charles
thompson,
the
execution
of
the
$6000
slaying
was
called
by
santa
barbara
police
lieutenant
charles
thompson,
the
most
cold-blooded
crime
i've
ever
heard.
and
then
i
perhaps
don't
specifically
bring
out
other
articles.
there
were
some
35
exhibits
attached
to
the
affidavit.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes,
in
january.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
no.
it
was
offered
on
that
specific
purpose
for
change
of
venue
to
support
the
affidavit.
then
of
course
the
affidavit
also
points
out
that
the
same
things
that
were
contained
this
page
22,
the
above
entitled
case
has
also
been
discussed
and
commented
upon
by
practically
every
radio
and
television
newscaster
in
the
los
angeles
ventura
county
area.
the
broadcast
which
our
client
has
heard
was
in
substance
the
same
as
that
reported
in
newspapers
attached
hereto
its
specifics.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
no,
your
honor.
there
were
many,
many
things.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
for
example,
the
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
insofar
as
moya
was
concerned
didn't
say
anything
about
his
prior
criminal
record
and
that
was
fully
brought
out
by
the
district
attorney's
statements.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
i
--
i
didn't
charge
him
specifically.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
your
honor,
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
was
not
direct
solely
at
the
district
attorney.
it
was
on
the
broad
general
ground
that
petitioner
could
not
have
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
in
ventura
county
at
which
the
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
no,
my
position
was
the
totality
of
facts.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
including
if
i
might
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
practical
difference
here.
one
being
that
material
purporting
to
him
an
aid
from
district
attorney
would
be
more
likely
if
he
believe
and
--
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes,
plus
the
fact
that
he
could
release
what
information
he
wanted
to.
for
example,
he
released
the
--
the
confessions
of
moya
and
baldonado
but
mrs.
duncan
had
denied
it
and
that
wasn't
released
to
the
press.
and
then
i
think
there's
something
a
lot
deeper
too
and
that
is
due
process,
as
i
understand
it,
means
a
denial
of
rights
and
whether
the
rights
are
denied
by
a
trial
judge
in
a
trial
or
by
other
state
officers
such
as
the
district
attorney
or
police
officers
that
it
makes
no
difference
by
which
particular
agency,
due
process
is
denied.
district
attorney,
being
a
state
officer,
could
clearly
violate
the
person's
right
to
due
process
such
as
in
the
cases
of
using
purged
testimony,
willfully
suppressing
evidence
favorable
to
the
defendant.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
that's
correct.
yes.
that's
raised
in
our
briefs.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
oh,
yes.
there
were
some
errors
in
the
trial
that
we
claim
were
reversible
error.
but
there
was
this
broad
issue
of
venue
and
one
of
our
salient
points
was
that
the
trial
judge
should
have
granted
change
of
venue
by
reason
of
the
totality
of
facts
that
we've
been
talking
about
today.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
appointed.
they
don't
have
a
public
defender's
office
in
ventura
county.
i
was
appointed
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
burt
m.
henson
thank
you.
