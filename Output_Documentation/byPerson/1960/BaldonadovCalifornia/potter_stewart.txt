potter
stewart
it's
the
same
jury
always,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
summarized
beginning
at
the
bottom
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
win?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
james
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
response
to
one
of
these
motions,
judge
blackstock
made
quite
a
--
unusual
response
about
indicating
his
impression
that
the
motion
was
reflecting
upon
the
honor
and
integrity
of
the
citizens
of
the
county
where
his
judge
--
where
can
i
find
that
in
the
record,
i've
read
it,
i
can't
find
it
now?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
a
superior
court
judge
county
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
officials
are
appointed
these
judges
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
an
elective
officer
for
six
terms
just
six
years.
justice
potter
stewart
moya,
where
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
identify
the
man
being
held
for
kidnapping?
justice
potter
stewart
so
these
two
--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
how
about
to
page
647
of
the
record,
i'm
referring
now
to
the
ms.
hall
who
sat.
she'd
early
--
she
had
earlier
stated
at
voir
dire
that
her
--
she'd
had
a
sorority
sister
who
had
been
murdered
further
that
her
sister
was
a
policewoman
and
that
her
father
was
a
policeman.
justice
potter
stewart
not
on
those
things
would
go
to
cause
but
they
went
raised
interesting
questions
from
the
part
of
--
the
possibility
of
our
preemptory
challenge
obviously
on
the
part
of
the
defense.
and
then
on
page
46,
47,
she
says,
in
answer
to
this
question,
now
there's
opinion
that
you
formed
with
the
respect
to
the
guilt
of
mrs.
duncan.
"do
you
still
have
that
opinion
as
you
sit
in
the
jury
box
this
--
box
this
morning?"
"well,
yes,
sir."
"and
is
that
opinion
such
that
it
would
take
some
evidence
on
the
part
of
the
defense
overcome?"
"no,
sir."
and
then
earlier
what
i
meant
to
read
was
this,
"i
take
it
then
that
you
form
an
opinion
that
elizabeth
duncan
was
guilty
of
this
charge.
is
that
right?"
he
says,
"that's
right."
and
that's
where
--
that's
--
that
was
her
opinion
as
she
came
into
the
jury
box.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
(voice
overlap)
says
that
he
had
tried
to
challenge
for
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
these
other
four
and
it
had
been
unsuccessful.
and
based
on
that
experience,
the
argument
is
that
he
was
not
going
to
--
since
he
knew
he
would
be
under
--
had
bearing,
good
reason
to
believe
it'd
be
unsuccessful
challenging
for
cause
in
this
case.
he
was
not
going
to
try
it
and
just
to
incur
the
resent
under
juror.
justice
potter
stewart
and
also
that
because
his
previous
challenges
for
cause,
if
it
disallowed,
he
was
--
didn't
have
a
remaining
preemptory
challenge
for
this
juror
or
for
the
other
two.
that's
the
basis
of
his
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
an
indication
here
on
page
647
that
is
as
this
ms.
hall
came
to
the
jury
box
quite
apart
from
the
murder
of
her
friend
and
the
rest
of
it,
but
as
to
her
opinion
about
these
defendant's
guilt,
she
said
she
had
it
that
she
thought
she
was
guilty.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
understand
your
argument
but
in
the
--
in
this
particular
context,
the
argument
may
have
some
merit
to
it
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
goes
from
629
to
640.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice

--
again
to
665.
