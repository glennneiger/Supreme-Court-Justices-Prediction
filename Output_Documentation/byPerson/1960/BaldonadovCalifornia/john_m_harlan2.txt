if
you
don't
mind
i
suggest
to
you,
i
think
you
help
us
a
lot
more
if
you
could
guide
us
through
what
you
consider
to
be
the
controlling
thing
instead
of
characterizing
them
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
would
like
to
ask
you
a
question,
if
may.
the
supreme
court
whatever
you
did
or
didn't
do
below,
the
supreme
court
of
california
dealt
with
your
claim
that
you're
making,
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
or
it
dealt
with
your
claim
that
by
reason
of
the
improper
denial
of
your
challenges
for
cause
as
you
claim
it,
on
these
four
jurors,
you
had
been
foreclosed
from
exercising
preemptory
challenges
on
the
last
three
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
which
you
otherwise
would
had?
that's
the
essence
of
your
claim,
is
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
read
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
it
dealt
with
that
claim.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
say
whether
it
dealt
with
it
as
a
matter
of
state
law
or
whether
it
dealt
with
it
as
a
matter
of
federal
claim
on
your
part,
what
did
you
contend
in
your
brief
on
appeal?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
got
your
brief
here?
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
be
willing
to
leave
them
with
the
clerk?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
thank
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
mrs.
duncan
prosecuted
this
what
you
call
fake
annulment?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
did
the
press
get
hold
of
baldonado's
confession?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
read
something
in
the
briefs,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
it,
to
the
effect
that
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
the
grand
jury
minutes
of
california
as
a
matter
of
public
registry,
is
that
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
--
was
the
confession
of
baldonado
confession
given
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
--
matter
of
public
record
once
it
had
been
given,
once
the
minutes
had
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
point
surely
is
that
it
affects
counsel
cannot
play
the
game
in
both
ways.
if
he
wants
to
stand
on
this
challenge,
he's
got
to
make
it
clear
and
if
he
doesn't
want
to
risk
the
effect
of
it,
well
that's
too
bad
whether
he
loose
an
appeal.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
your
position?
