mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
these
consolidated
petitions,
each
of
the
petitioners
were
charged
with
murder,
in
the
ventura
county
in
california.
each
of
them
was
sentenced
to
the
death
sentence
and
are
presently
under
death
sentence.
the
petitioner
duncan
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
charge.
in
brief
would
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
was
that
she
had
conspired
with
the
remaining,
with
the
other
two
defendants
to
murder
her
daughter-in-law,
the
wife
of
her
son,
the
young
lawyer
in
santa
barbara
because
of
the
--
of
jealousy,
because
he
had
married
this
girl.
in
any
event,
she
pleaded
not
guilty
and
she
was
convicted
by
a
jury
and
thereafter
under
the
procedure
in
california
which
is
to
the
effect
that
one
who
is
convicted
in
a
capital
case
may
then
have
a
trial
by
jury
as
to
--
as
to
what
the
sentence
maybe,
either
life
imprisonment
or
death.
she
was
given
the
death
sentence.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
same
jury.
with
respect
to
the
other
two
petitioners,
while
in
custody,
they
made
confessions.
in
a
moment,
i
shall
tell
your
honors
the
circumstances
of
the
release
of
the
confessions
by
the
district
attorney,
but
in
any
event,
they
made
confessions
that
they
--
to
the
effect
that
they
had
been
employed
by
mrs.
duncan
to
murder
her
daughter-in-law
and
thereafter,
they
pleaded
guilty,
but
they
were
entitled
to
a
trial
by
a
jury
as
to
what
sentence
should
be
imposed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
till
they
pleaded
guilty
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
they
were
--
they
were
entitled
under
california
procedure
to
a
trial
by
court
or
jury
and
they
selected
a
jury
as
to
what
sentence
should
be
imposed,
either
the
death
sentence
or
life
imprisonment,
and
they
were
given
death
sentences.
this
court
in
the
grant
of
certiorari,
a
number
of
issues
were
raised
in
the
petitions,
limited
the
issues
to
two,
and
i
shall
paraphrase
them
summarily.
the
first
issue
which
--
to
which
this
court
limited
certiorari
was
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
resulting
publicity
in
the
community
in
ventura,
i'm
of
course
paraphrasing
the
court's
order,
the
court's
orders
are
in
--
are
in
the
record,
if
your
honor
--
your
honors
have
page
reference,
in
any
event
the
first
issue
is
whether
as
--
as
indicated
by
this
court,
was
whether
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
resulting
publicity
as
well
as
other
accompanying
circumstances
deprived
the
petitioners
of
a
fair
trial
and
a
due
process
under
the
constitution
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
court
also
indicated
another
issue
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
presence
of
three
jurors
who
finally
remained
on
the
panel
which
tried
one
of
the
defendants
who
when
they
arrived
in
the
jury
box
as
been
not
--
as
then
prospective
jurors
and
venire
admitted
that
they
believe
the
defendant
guilty
whether
or
not
their
continued
presence
upon
--
they
be
selected
as
jurors
and
their
continued
presence
as
members
of
the
jury
violate
the
right
of
fair
trial
guaranteed
by
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
it.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
yes.
the
second
issue
applies
only
to
the
duncan
case.
the
first
issue
applies
to
all
of
the
three
cases.
i
shall
address
myself
entirely
to
the
first
issue,
first
of
the
two
issues
and
i
shall
be
followed
by
mr.
warner
who
will
address
himself
to
the
second
issue
which
applies
exclusively
to
the
duncan
case
and
then
it
is
our
plan
with
your
honors
permission
to
have
mr.
henson
make
the
rebuttal
argument
in
--
in
all
of
the
cases.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
it
is
our
position
that
what
happened
in
the
duncan
trial
as
to
the
rulings
of
the
court
and
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
in
connection
with
that
case
has
the
bearing
upon
all
of
the
cases.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
probable
that
the
precise
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
there
were
three
jurors
in
the
duncan
case
who
had
an
express
whether
--
expressed
an
opinion.
that
is
limited
in
the
duncan
case
but
let
me
qualify
it
further.
it's
our
contention
that
there
were
jurors
in
both
the
baldonado
and
moya
cases
as
well
as
in
the
duncan
case,
who
have
formed
the
opinions
as
the
result
of
the
publicity,
there's
the
(inaudible)
district
attorney
and
who
remained
on
the
jury
so
that
these
defendants
also
were
denied
a
fair
trial.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
is
with
respect
to
the
others
only
in
this
limited
context,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
under
all
of
the
circumstances,
the
others,
baldonado
and
moya
received
the
kind
of
trial
which
the
due
process
clause
accords
every
person
particularly
in
the
capital
case.
so
to
that
narrow
extent
and
only
to
that
narrow
extent
is
it
in
the
case.
the
thrust
or
the
gravamen
of
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
other
two
petitioners
would
also
apply
to
mrs.
duncan
is
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
and
the
resulting
publicity
and
with
respect
to
that,
but
i
want
to
primarily,
not
entirely,
address
myself
and
proceed
to
--
to
make
my
presentation.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
sequence
of
the
trial
was
as
follows.
mrs.
duncan
was
tried
first
both
thrust
on
guilty
and
then
the
death
sentence
was
imposed.
baldonado
was
tried
second
and
the
last
of
the
trio
was
moya.
i
shall
i
think
i'm
reasonably
certain
in
my
argument,
have
some
occasion
to
refer
specifically
to
the
dates
because
and
i
may
say
to
you
at
this
point
then
i
won't
say
it
later,
because
it
is
our
contention
that
the
prejudicial
effects
of
the
statements
made
to
the
press
by
the
district
attorney
continued
in
their
impact
throughout
a
reasonably
long
period
and
continued
through
the
trials
of
baldonado
and
moya.
and
in
that
respect,
it
is
our
position
that
the
cases
to
be
distinguished
from
a
case
which
i
argued
before,
some
of
your
honors
some
time
ago,
the
strobel
case
in
which
there
was
--
once
they
had
been
by
a
prosecutor,
justice
clark
wrote
the
opinion,
justice
frankfurter,
and
justices
black,
and
douglas
dissented,
be
that
as
it
may.
in
that
case
there
was
one
statement
by
a
prosecutor
made
a
long
time
prior
to
the
trial
and
this
court
took
the
view
that
the
impact
of
that
improper
statement
had
dissipated
prior
to
the
actual
trial.
in
our
--
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
that
is
not
so,
but
on
the
contrary,
the
impact
continued
probably
because
of
the
nature
and
the
quality
of
the
statements
made
by
the
prosecutor
to
the
press
and
largely
because
he
continued
to
make
statements
which
were
prejudicial
and
inflammatory
throughout
the
three
proceedings.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
that
is
correct,
your
honor
except
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
may
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright.
in
the
first
place
to
answer
your
--
your
honor's
specific
question,
it
is
true
that
the
cases
are
here
on
three
separate
documents
which
are
denominated
rec
--
separate
records
in
each
case.
however,
with
respect
to
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
which
was
made
and
it
is
largely
in
connection
with
the
rejection
or
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
change
of
venue,
a
motion
suggesting
prejudice
in
the
community.
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
change
of
venue,
i
think
it
is
accurate
to
say
that
all
of
the
petitioners
relied
upon
the
same
--
some
immaterial
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
--
but
separately
introduced
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
quite
--
quite
so.
separate
--
there
was
--
they
were
by
--
both
by
stipulation
and
they
were
by
stipulation
incorporated
in
each
of
the
cases.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
what
is
the
exception?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
believe
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
except
that
--
except
your
honor
that
some
of
the
material
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
when
i
say
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
may
i
just
say
to
your
honor
that
the
identical
material
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
identical
material
appears
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
identical
material
upon
which
their
motion
for
change
of
venue
was
relied
upon
appears
for
instance
in
the
baldonado
record
and
in
the
moya
record.
baldonado's
counsel
having
adopted
the
material
which
are
--
which
was
presented
in
the
--
in
the
moya
record.
so
to
that
extent
while
the
records
are
separate,
some
of
the
material
is
duplicative
in
that
it
was
physically
incorporated
in
the
other
record.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
stipulation
was
--
might
maybe
deem
to
be
--
this
maybe
deem
to
be
so,
namely,
that
portions
of
the
record
in
one
case
maybe
deem
to
be
considered
in
the
other
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
i'm
entirely
content
to
answer
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question
by
saying
that
we
are
content
that
each
case
be
considered
upon
the
record
of
that
case
and
move
along
then
to
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
mrs.
duncan
was
sentenced
on
april
the
3rd.
baldonado's
trial
began
on
april
the
6th.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
right.
that
is
true.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
on
april
6.
three
days
thereafter.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
included
about
--
and
took
three
days
and
concluded
on
april
9.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
moya's
trial
began
on
april
20th
about
10
days
thereafter
although
there
were
some
proceedings
in
connection
with
moya
between
april
9th
and
april
20th.
so
that
it
is
our
contention
that
quite
immediately
one
after
the
other,
these
cases
were
tried
though
of
course
conceded
that
the
issues
in
the
baldonado
and
moya
cases
were
different,
the
issue
was
different
from
one
of
the
issue
which
was
in
the
duncan
case
maybe
of
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
was
raised
indeed.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
think
i
maybe
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
good,
good
your
honor.
may
i
just
say
--
may
i
just
make
one
qualification
if
i
may
because
i
don't'
want
to
misstate
anything.
i
think
it
is
probable
that
the
duncan
record
differs
in
some
respect
on
the
issue
of
change
of
venue,
from
the
record
in
the
moya
and
baldonado
cases,
but
as
to
those
cases,
the
record
is
identical
because
of
the
operation.
now
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
3rd
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
baldonado
began
three
days
thereafter.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
on
--
on
the
penalty.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
yes
it
was.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
was.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
but
it
is
our
contention
that
after
her
trial
was
concluded,
there
were
still
statements
pertaining
to
the
involvement
of
all
of
the
three
defendants,
including
the
remaining
two
by
the
district
attorney.
so
we
think
that
the
critical
dates
or
critical
date
is
not
when
she
was
convicted
but
what
transpired
during
this
--
this
entire
proceeding
and
i'm
prepared
now
to
state
what
took
place,
what's
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
and
what
the
presence
of
the
mass
media
did
about
it?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
merely
our
contention
that
it
affected
the
trials
which
dealt
which
followed
thereafter.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
if
i
will
answer
your
honor's
question,
the
(inaudible)
moya
from
our
point
of
view
was
the
--
the
victim
or
the
subject
of
the
cumulative
effect
of
numerous
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney
first
in
the
duncan
case
and
then
to
the
baldonado
case
and
i
have
occasion
also
to
refer
in
--
in
passing
to
some
of
the
rulings
made
by
the
trial
court
and
the
publicity
given
to
them
which
we
think
was
also
prejudicial.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
when
i
say
the
rulings
i
am
referring
to,
for
instance,
a
statement
made
by
the
judge.
i'm
referring
to
two
things.
first,
the
statement
made
by
a
judge
which
according
to
the
record
was
publicized
widely
in
--
in
the
local
press
that,
and
i
am
paraphrasing
it,
that
the
suggestion
that
the
citizens
of
ventura
county
could
not
give
a
fair
trial
to
these
defendants
was
an
insult
to
their
integrity
and
insult
to
their
integrity
and
we
see
that
kind
of
a
statement,
i
am
not
talking
about
rulings,
i
said
rulings
i
misspoke
myself,
the
kind
of
a
statement
made
publicly
obviously
made
--
may
have
had
prejudicial
effect
with
respect
to
all
of
the
defendants
who
by
that
time
hadn't
been
tried
at
all.
moreover
to
answer
your
honor's
question,
affirmed.
when
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
in
the
duncan
case,
he
made
a
statement
which
appeared
in
the
local
press
as
a
matter
of
utmost
importance.
generally
commending,
i'm
not
sure
about
the
precise
word
now,
the
verdict
in
the
--
in
the
duncan
case.
and
moreover,
when
shortly
thereafter,
the
after
sentence
was
imposed,
baldonado
was
tried
and
the
jury
found
him
guilty
after
having
been
out
purely,
through
imposed
death
sentence,
after
having
deliberated
on
the
matter
less
than
two
hours.
the
judge
said
to
the
jury
and
to
the
public
and
thence
to
the
press,
he
complimented
the
jury
and
he
congratulated
them
upon
their
courage.
now
we
think
that
kind
of
a
thing
may
--
maybe
a
factor
in
having
influenced
the
jury
which
three
days
thereafter
was
going
to
determine
whether
to
send
--
to
send
to
gas
chamber
the
third
of
these
defendants,
namely,
mr.
moya.
but
however,
the
major
point
of
our
--
of
our
complaint
is
the
matter
of,
if
i'll
use
a
shorthand
phrase
of
trial
by
newspaper,
but
that's
not
an
accurate
phrase
in
this
case
because
what
all
of
these
petitioners
object
to
is
not
trial
by
newspaper
(inaudible)
to
trial
by
fair
court
and
jury,
but
trial
by
prosecutor
in
the
newspapers.
and
hence
the
problems
which
this
court
had
in
bridges
and
the
times
cases
and
other
cases
to
determine
one
point
at
what
point
a
newspaper
opens
against
the
law
by
virtue
of
publications
which
have
a
tendency
to
do
affect
the
administration
of
justice.
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
california
through
one
of
its
agencies,
namely
the
district
attorney
of
ventura
county,
intentionally
or
otherwise,
it
makes
much
difference,
resorted
to
the
press
and
made
prejudicial
and
inflammatory
statements
to
the
press,
calculated
the
prejudice
the
community
against
these
defendants
as
the
result
of
which
conduct
by
the
district
attorney,
these
defendants
did
not
get
in
ventura
county
in
california
that
kind
of
fair
trial
which
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
accords
to
all.
and
so
i
turn
then
with
the
expectation
of
giving
your
honors
some
specific
details
or
certainly
not
all
of
them
because
the
statements
by
the
district
attorney
and
law
enforcement
officers
on
this
control
are
very
many.
they
are
outlined
in
our
briefs
and
needless
to
say,
i
do
not
have
the
time
and
shouldn't
take
the
time
to
outline
them
all.
but
i
do
want
to
indicate
some
of
them
to
give
your
honor
some
examples
of
--
of
the
following.
let
me
--
before
i
come
to
that,
let's
make
a
further
argument
or
conclusion
or
state
my
own
opinion
and
then
i
shall
develop
the
facts.
as
we
understand
it,
the
constitution
accords
to
all
the
right
to
one
trial
and
to
a
fair
one.
we
think
in
this
case
these
defendants,
these
petitioners,
received
two
trials,
neither
of
which
was
fair.
the
first
trial
was
in
the
public
press,
a
trial
in
which
the
district
attorney
acted
as
prosecutor
and
the
second
trial
was
before
a
court
and
jury
which
we
think
was
only
a
trial
in
--
in
really
no
more
than
in
form,
a
trial
which
merely
registered
or
recorded
the
verdict
which
had
already
been
reached
by
the
community
from
which
the
jurors
who
tried
these
defendants
were
selected
and
that
therefore,
though
i
hope
i'm
not
overstating
it,
that
what
happened
in
these
cases
was
that
the
verdict
had
already
been
sealed
against
these
defendants
in
the
community
and
the
court
proceeding
was
merely
the
form
of
--
of
opening
up
the
verdict
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor
it's
quite,
i'm
sure
your
honor
is
quite
right.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
hope
so.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i'm
going
to
start
with
duncan.
well
because
--
because
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well,
the
reason
i
said
i
hope
so
is
i
have
so
often
failed
in
carrying
out
my
--
my
intention.
moreover,
i
must
also
make
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
understand,
but
i
must
--
must
say
to
your
honors,
nonetheless
at
this
point
that
with
respect
to
the
defendants
moya
and
baldonado,
they
rely
upon
the
statements
made
against
them
and
about
them
made
by
the
district
attorney
which
statements
were
filed
in
the
duncan
case
as
also
to
mrs.
duncan
to
be
sure
once
the
duncan
case
is
through
then
she
can
no
longer
rely
upon
any
conduct
by
the
district
attorney
and
baldonado
and
moya
can.
and
when
baldonado's
case
is
through,
he
cannot
rely
upon
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney
but
moya
can
and
i
shall
attempt
to
distinguish
between
these
three
situations
as
they
go
along.
your
honors,
we
have
a
attached
as
an
appendix
to
the
brief
in
the
baldonado
case
for
the
convenience
of
the
court
two
of
the
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney
which
we
consider
the
most
prejudicial
and
the
most
unfair.
one
is
in
appendix
a
which
had
and
that's
in
two
sheets
and
the
other
is
appendix
b.
your
honors
will
(voice
overlap)
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
baldonado
brief
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
and
the
government
printer
was
good
enough
to
make
an
offset
copy
of
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
your
honors
will
note
the
--
the
headline,
i
can't
refer
to
it
except
because
of
course
the
prosecutor
is
not
responsible
for
--
for
headlines.
she
doesn't
write
--
like
headlines
of
any
newspapers,
but
your
honors
will
note
that
under
this
headline
which
is
at
larger
type
as
i've
ever
seen
in
this
--
in
this
paper,
the
district
attorney
has
quoted
in
the
extreme
right
hand
column,
extendedly
–
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
he
has
quoted
as
same
and
he's
going
to
present
the
case
to
the
grand
jury.
we
don't
think
that's
extremely
prejudicial.
we
do
think
that
a
statement
made
by
him
which
is
after
the
--
the
second
fold
on
the
right
hand
column
to
the
effect
that
mrs.
duncan
had
previously
tried
to
hire
the
killing
of
her
son's
wife
and
a
direct
quotation
attributed
to
him,
which
he
has
never
denied.
this
is
not
the
first
time
mrs.
duncan
tried
to
have
her
killed.
we
think
this
was
an
entirely
improper
statement
by
a
district
attorney
at
a
time
when
these
defendants
having
him
been
charged
with
any
crime
although
they
have
been
arrested
and
were
under
a
suspicion.
we
think
moreover
that
it
was
improper
and
incidentally
this
case
does
not
involve
the
conduc
--
the
misconduct
of
the
district
attorney
in
any
direct
way.
this
is
not
a
contempt
proceeding
against
the
district
attorney.
the
narrow
question
which
your
honors
have
to
face
is
whether
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
deprived
these
defendants
of
a
fair
trial.
we
think
it
did
for
the
district
attorney
to
make
public
to
the
press
and
to
--
and
to
this
community
a
comparatively
small
community
of
about
170
to
180,000
people
in
their
county,
essentially
a
rural
community.
we
think
it
was
depriving
these
defendants
of
the
fair
trial
to
which
they
--
they
were
entitled
and
which
trial
they
were
made
to
have
for
the
district
attorney
to
release
the
confession
of
one
of
the
defendants
all
together.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
we
think
it's
clear
your
honor
from
a
reading
of
the
story
that
the
district
attorney
comments
on
the
confession.
it
is
further
clear
that
at
that
time
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
you
honor,
the
best
i
can
do
and
say
to
your
honor
that
the
story
recites
that
officers
said
that
mrs.
duncan
was
told
certain
things
and
then
officers
undertake
to
summarize
the
confession
which
--
which
was
made
by
--
by
this
defendant.
moreover
refer
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
would
your
honor
bear
with
me
a
moment?
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
may
i
--
may
i
give
that
direct
reference
to
your
honor
a
little
--
little
bit
later
if
necessary
through
other
counsel.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
to
the
effect
that
the
district
attorney
made
public
this
confession.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
it
isn't
as
clear
as
i
should
like
it.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
it
is
--
it
is
summarized,
the
defendant
was
in
custody.
the
confession
could
have
been
given
to
the
press
only
by
the
law
enforcement
officers
of
whom
the
district
attorney
was
in
charge,
but
your
honor,
let
me
--
let
me
back
away
from
that
and
let
me
give
your
honor
a
little
bit
later
a
direct
reference
to
the
district
attorney
having
made
this
confession
public.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
then
--
but
your
honor,
we
object
not
quite
as
much
to
the
release
of
the
confession
as
we
do
to
the
statement
given
to
the
press
by
the
district
attorney,
at
the
same
time
that
this
confession
was
made
public
no
matter
who
made
it
public.
under
a
headline
again
for
which
he
is
not
responsible
on
the
left
hand
side,
da
urges
death
term
in
killing
and
according
to
this
story,
which
has
never
been
denied
by
the
district
attorney,
he
issued
a
formal
statement
to
the
press.
he,
the
prosecutor,
he
is
under
obligation
to
accord
these
defendants
of
fair
trial.
before
their
trial
had
even
began,
talks
about
the
killing
as
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
brutal
calculated
revolting
killing
for
hire,
makes
the
decisions
for
hire
of
all,
of
over
duncan
and
then
he
goes
on
and
on
and
in
the
last
paragraph,
and
in
the
last
paragraph
of
this
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney.
he
says,
“i
hope
the
people
of
this
state
rise
up
against
the
propaganda,
double
in
connection
with
capital
punishment
and
they
must
demand
so
and
so.
now
we
think
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
--
yes.
i
think
your
honor
that
is
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
was
going
to
say,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
it
is
not
entirely
correct
for
this
reason
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
the
reading
what
appears
under
this
general
--
under
this
main
banner,
you
should
read
this
statement
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
context
of
the
confession
which
had
been
made
public.
and
i
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
--
first
that
it
is
a
reasonable
inference
that
the
district
attorney
who
is
quoted
in
one
context
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
if
you
will
bear
with
me
and
you
said
you
would,
you
will
discover
that
in
this
--
that
the
district
attorney
is
quoted
in
quotation
mark
–
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
--
as
having
said
--
as
having
said,
this
is
not
the
first
time
mrs.
duncan
tried
to
have
her
killed.
so
in
part
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
jackson
–
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
am
saying
to
your
honor
that
with
respect
to
the
question
as
to
whether
he
released
it,
i
hope
to
demonstrate
that
to
you
(voice
overlap)
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
quite
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
--
but,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
while
it
is
true
that
the
statement
which
the
district
attorney
gave
to
the
press
on
the
death
penalty
does
not
mention
any
of
these
defendants
by
name.
he
is
talking
about
the
only
offense
which
is
involved
in
this
matter,
he's
talking
about
the
brutal
killing
by
hirebales
by
duncan.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
know.
i
think
i
know.
i'm
glad
to
answer
any
question.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
we
think
another
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney,
which
appears
in
appendix
b
to
that
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
all
i
have
in
mind
as
to
that
exhibit
is
concerned
with
the
qualification
that
i
am
claiming
that
it
is
part
of
a
persistent
continuing
program
and
plan
by
the
district
attorney
to
make
statements
concerning
these
cases
to
the
press
prior
to
and
during
the
trials
which
said
statements
adversely
affected
such
defendants
as
--
as
where
they
were
after
tried.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
i
don't
object
to
anything
that
a
newspaper
prints.
i'm
objecting
to
what
the
district
attorney
hands
out
to
a
newspaper
to
print
in
connection
with
the
guilt
of
the
defendants.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
now
the
other
statement
i'm
calling
your
honors'
attention
is
a
statement
attributed
to
the
district
attorney
which
he
has
never
denied
and
this
is
at
a
time
also
prior
to
that
trial,
it
is
appendix
b
to
our
--
to
our
--
to
the
brief
and
in
it,
well,
he
makes
an
argument.
he
refers
to
the
three
persons
who
had
been
arraigned.
so
obviously,
he
was
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that
was
september
22nd.
this
next
statement
is
on
december
30.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
eight
days
after.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
in
the
meantime
as
our
briefs
indicate
particularly
in
the
moya
brief,
every
single
day
between
the
22nd
of
the
30th,
mr.
gustafson
made
some
statement
about
the
--
about
the
evidence
and
about
the
case.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
they
are
--
they
are
in
two
places.
first
they
are
in
the
record,
in
the
form
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
alright.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
those
are
the
only
two
in
the
baldonado.
the
moya
brief
is
much
fuller
your
honor
and
contains
numerous
other
statements
which
do
not
appear
in
the
baldonado
brief,
and
if
i
may
turn
to
the
moya
brief
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
they
were
in
the
moya
and
baldonado
cases.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
some
of
--
some
of
these
were
not
in
the
duncan
record,
but
were
in
the
moya
and
baldonado
records
although
the
two
statements
which
i
have
just
called
up
your
honors'
attention
were
in
the
--
in
all
of
the
records.
but
now
this
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
--
i
would
answer
that
yes.
now
that
in
the
moya
brief,
we
have
references
to
the
moya
record
with
respect
to
the
further
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
would
make
that
concession.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
in
any
event
let
me
say
that
in
the
moya
record,
there
are
references
to
numerous
other
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
record
in
the
moya
record
at
the
various
page
of
references.
they
are
found
in
the
moya
brief
at
pages
8
to
11
and
the
record
references
appear
there.
with
respect
to
moya
and
baldonado,
the
district
attorney
not
only
made
various
statements,
some
of
which
i've
already
called
your
honor's
attention,
but
after
he
had
argued
the
case
to
the
jury,
he
deemed
it
appropriate
to
issue
a
formal
release
to
the
press
explaining
that
when
he
made
some
remarks
about
some
of
the
other
judges
in
the
course
of
which
to
the
jury,
he
had
said
that
he
was
ashamed
of
their
conduct.
he
made
a
formal
release
to
the
press
that
he
had
misspoken
himself
and
all
he
intended
to
say
was
that
he
had
regretted
the
conduct
of
these
other
judges
rather
than
being
ashamed
of
it.
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
district
attorney.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
this
was
after
his
argument
in
the
duncan
case.
he
made
the
statement.
i
am
merely
citing
that
as
an
example,
that
the
district
attorney
was
of
the
view
that
it
was
entirely
proper
for
him
to
make
such
statements
as
he
--
as
that
occurred
to
him
in
connection
with
the
trial
--
with
the
trial
of
the
case
or
what
happened
in
the
case.
the
newspaper
--
local
newspapers
were
thought
that
when
the
jury
verdict
came
in,
in
the
duncan
case,
he
hailed
the
verdict
and
we
think
that
must
have
had
some
effect
upon
the
jurors
who
were
thereafter
selected
to
determine
the
sentences,
to
be
imposed
on
moya
and
baldonado.
now
with
respect
to
moya
and
baldonado,
then
i
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i'll
merely
answer
your
honor's
two
foldedly
that
i
want
to
use
my
colleagues.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
the
district
attorney
in
common
fairness
may
not
try
his
case
twice.
he
may
not
tell
the
public
from
which
a
jury
is
selected,
what
his
evidence
is
going
to
be,
and
may
not
make
statements
which
are
prejudicial
against
the
defendants
first
in
the
public
press
and
then
repeat
them
before
--
before
the
jury.
in
other
words,
if
(inaudible)
tries
the
case
once,
and
it
entitled
to
try
his
case
in
the
public
--
at
a
public
trial
rather
than
public
press.
moreover,
whenever
a
district
attorney
makes
a
statement
before
a
court
in
jury,
the
defendant
is
there.
he
is
represented
by
counsel,
and
the
defendants'
counsel
have
--
have
some
opportunity
to
meet
that
statement
and
to
refute
it.
in
this
instance,
when
the
district
attorney
resorts
to
the
public
casting
and
results
to
the
press
to
try
his
case,
the
defendants
in
this
instance
most
of
the
statement
he
has
(inaudible)
not
even
represented
by
counsel.
a
seriously
disadvantage
and
what
happens
is
as
it
happened
in
this
case
the
community
makes
up
its
mind
with
respect
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
or
the
quantum
of
sentence
to
be
imposed
before
members
of
that
community
reach
the
jury
box
and
then
the
jury
box
--
and
then
the
jurors
and
the
jury
box
are
disposed
as
most
human
beings
are
to
accord
to
or
to
adhere
to
in
the
opinion
and
judgment
which
they
had
theretofore
made
from
reading
the
statements
of
the
district
attorney.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
i
think
this
your
honor.
in
the
first
place,
it's
easier
for
me
to
answer
this
question
of
the
counsel
because
i
was
not
one
of
the
counsels
in
the
case.
but
in
any
event,
it
is
--
it
is
their
position
as
i
understand
it,
that
when
they
came
into
the
case,
such
prejudicial
statements
have
been
made
by
the
district
attorney
against
--
against
these
defendants.
the
day
he
felt
as
a
matter
of
elementary
self
defense
to
accord
their
defendants,
the
mode
to
come
of
a
fair
hearing
ultimately
that
they
should
make
some
reply.
this
is
particularly
true.
mr.
henson
will
tell
your
honors
about
a
recording
of
which
he
arranged
to
have
played
of
the
defendant
moya.
moreover
your
honor,
while
the
list
in
the
appendix
by
the
attorney
general
is
a
long
one,
the
import
of
the
statements
made
by
counsel
for
the
defendants
is
that
they
were
nominal
and
inconsequential
statements
not
at
all
comparing
or
contrasting
to
the
vigorous
and
prejudicial
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney
and
finally
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
that's
a
--
i
think
that's
a
--
an
overly
strong
statement.
actually
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
we're
going
outside
the
record
as
has
the
attorney
general.
mr.
gustafson
did
run
for
--
for
office
immediately
after
these
cases.
but
i
think
that's
an
improper
statement.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
oh,
three
or
five
six
months,
i'm
sure.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
same
year.
now
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
he
didn't.
the
sole
for
a
second
thought
in
the
community
tried.
one
final
word
to
your
honor;
in
any
event,
in
any
event,
even
--
even
if
counsel
for
the
defendants
made
the
improper
statements,
the
more
evidence
that
the
defendants
whose
rights
after
all
are
the
ones
who
are
--
rights
are
at
issue
and
those
lives
are
in
stake,
in
any
event,
any
misconduct
by
the
prosecutor
is
not
a
tone
for
compensated
by
comparable
misconduct
even
by
counsel
for
the
defendants.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
just
the
recording,
i
think.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes.
the
district
attorney
as
we
contend
issued
a
statement
to
the
press
calling
for
--
as
to
--
as
to
the
nature
of
that
confession,
calling
from
that
confession
the
most
horrendous
features
advantageous
to
the
prosecution
and
harmful
to
the
defendant.
and
as
explained
in
the
reply
brief
which
the
defendant
moya
filed,
his
court
appointed
counsel
was
of
the
view
that
when
the
district
attorney
distorted
the
confession
and
painted
this
defendant
in
this
horrendous
role
that
if
the
public
or
the
entire
confession
as
it
was
actually
given,
it
would
dilute
or
mitigated
some
part
of
the
prejudice
which
the
district
attorney
had
created
in
making
the
confession
public.
later
on,
i
shall
keep
my
promise
to
justice
frankfurter
to
demonstrate
the
district
attorney
made
this
confession
public.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
indeed,
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
by
the
--
by
the
personal
officials.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
he
was
--
he
was
in
county
jail.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
prison
county
jail,
the
district
attorney
pretty
much
has
a
large
authority
over
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
facts
have
not
been
made
clear
by
me,
let
me
do
so.
what
happened
was
that
the
district
attorney
or
the
law
enforcement
officers
secured
a
recording
in
prison
from
this
defendant.
this
was
taken
ex
parte
and
in
camera.
the
attorney
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
we
have
not
challenged
that.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
the
attorney
for
--
the
court
appointed
attorney,
mr.
henson
for
this
defendant
knew
about
this
recording
because
it
was
reported,
in
the
press
there
was
a
recording.
so
he
secured
a
copy
of
the
recording
through
discovery
proceeding
and
then
he
arranged
for
this
recording
made
by
the
prison
officials
to
be
played
over
the
--
over
the
radio.
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
the
--
he
arranged
himself
and
never
saw.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
well
no,
he
secured
a
court
order
and
to
examine
and
to
secure
access
to
the
state
recording.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
that's
true.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
of
course
not.
he
did
when
he
read
in
the
papers
that
there
had
been
one.
and
then
he
thought
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
no.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
yes
sir.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
your
honor
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
think
the
district
attorney
consented.
both
sides
consented
i
think
that
is.
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
first
as
to
the
role
of
the
district
attorney,
my
recollection
know
what
took
place
was
that
the
district
attorney
said,
“i
object
to
it
unless
the
defendant
consents.”
alright,
now
the
defendant
did
consent,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
defendant
duncan.
so
there's
no
question
that
was
asked
to
defendant
duncan.
she
is
in
no
position
to
object
to
the
photography
or
the
news
reel,
tv
recordings
which
were
made
of
that
trial.
but
your
honor,
immediately
after
mrs.
duncan
was
sentenced,
baldonado
came
on
for
trial
for
his
life
as
did
moya
thereafter.
neither
they
nor
their
counsel
consented
to
these
photographs
or
these
new
--
or
these
tv
reportings
and
yet
they
were
the
victims
of
it.
so
far
as
the
--
mr.
a.
l.
wirin
i
can't
be
sure,
mr.
henson
perhaps
will
answer
your
honors
question
more
directly.
