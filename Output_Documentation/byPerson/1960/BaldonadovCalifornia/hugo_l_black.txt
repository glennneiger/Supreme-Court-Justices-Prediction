what
brief
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
that
prove
that
any
other
juror
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
your
problem
is,
isn't
it,
on
this
point
to
show
that
jurors
were
kept
on
like
that,
not
to
some
jurors
who
let
of.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
the
reason
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
did
--
i
suppose
what
we
need
to
decide
if
you
use
mental
processes,
the
jurors
were
left
on
there
like
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
what
the
court
thought
about
it.
justice

page
what
number?
justice

l.
black
did
you
say
he
disappeared
to
ventu
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
santa
barbara.
justice
hugo
l.

was
she
living
there
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
those
adjoining
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
have
a
brief
in
the
duncan
case
also?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
those
the
ones
that
you've
just
referred
to
or
there's
more?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
--
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
it
was
reference
to
these
all
of
them
but
one
related
to
the
fake
trial
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
was
the
subject
to
fake
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
motion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
that
motion
would
may
pertain
in
the
venue
on
the
ground
that
the
publicity
in
connection
with
the
other
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
was
all
prejudice
to
public
if
you
couldn't
have
that
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
the
indictment,
anybody
could
go
up
and
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
date
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
basically
limit
that
to
california
because
i
was
thinking.
as
far
as
i'm
concern,
it
was
my
experience
as
prosecuting
attorney
does
not
control
the
police
as
a
sheriff
with
reference
to
what
they
publish.
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
where
i
can
from.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
what
you're
saying
is
that
while
the
papers
had
an
article
which
said
that
came
from
the
authority.
the
authorities
haven't
said
so
and
i
--
suppose
you're
saying,
prosecuting
attorney
doesn't
ordinarily
consider
his
duties
to
deny
every
statement
made
in
the
press
about
his
spectacular
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
which
affidavit
now
is
being
referred
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
change
of
venue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
at
one
--
assuming
--
let's
assume
that
there
was
error
in
the
refusal
to
excuse
the
four,
then
assuming
if
one
disagreed
with
it,
he
had
felt
that
there
was
clear
error
with
reference
to
the
three
that
it
should
be
noted
here.
is
there
anything
that
shows
with
reference
to
those
three
that
they
had
a
fixed
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
opinion
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
that
shows
that
they
had
an
opinion
which
was
of
the
kind
that
the
other
four
had?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
should
obtain
really
time
to
--
that
i
started
out
to
ask
you
about
these
three
jurors
and
i
would
like
to
say
(inaudible)
find
out
who
was
the
second,
who
was
the
third
and
where
is
the
statement
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
mr.
horrell.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
that
the
original
motion
for
change
of
venue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
also
for
any
purpose
except
that,
as
to
the
change
of
venue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
get
the
complete
importance
of
the
question
you
raised
of
the
--
who
did
it.
it
seems
to
me
like
if
you
were
to
try
the
right
to
--
if
you
were
forced
to
try
a
case
in
a
county
where
you
should
be
because
of
the
--
that
feeling
in
that
county,
the
question
is
whether
you
--
whether
they
should
give
you
a
change
of
venue.
and
what
difference
would
it
make
who
said
it
except
to
the
question
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
--
that
was
--
give
you
a
greater
--
greater
reason
to
get
your
change
of
venue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
why
you
raised
the
issues.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
you
filed
the
brief
you
raised
with
the
state?
was
your
argument
before
the
state,
if
you
had
asked
the
court
to
grant
a
mistrial
if
a
new
trial
is
something
on
the
ground
of
the
district
attorney
of
that
behavior?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
ever
--
was
that
ever
done?
