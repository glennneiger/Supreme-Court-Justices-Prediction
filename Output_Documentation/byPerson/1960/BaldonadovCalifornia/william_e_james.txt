mr.
william
e.
james
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices
--
mr.
william
e.
james
thank
you
your
honor.
i
will
address
myself
first
to
the
first
question
to
which
this
matter
was
limited
upon
the
order
granting
certiorari
and
that
was
whether
the
petitioners
and
that's
all
three
of
the
petitioners'
rights
to
a
fair
trial,
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
violated
by
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney,
the
resulting
publicity,
and
the
other
circumstances
attending
to
this
trial.
it
is
our
position
that
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
actually
was
never
an
issue
in
the
trial
below.
that
the
issue
in
the
trial
below
on
the
motions
for
change
of
venue
related
to
the
newspaper
publicity
and
the
question
that
the
court
was
faced
with
and
which
our
supreme
court
was
faced
was
were
these
defense
denied
that
fair
trial,
the
right
to
an
impartial
jury
as
a
result
of
newspaper
publicity.
and
it
was
presented
to
the
trial
courts,
and
it
was
presented
to
the
supreme
court
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
and
newspaper
exhibits
that
were
presented
to
the
trial
court
on
the
various
motions
for
change
of
venue.
and
it
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
newspaper
reports
of
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
the
other,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
the
newspaper
publicity
was
an
important
thing.
the
district
attorn
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
think
the
opinion
of
our
supreme
court
referred
to
the
district
attorney
was
reported
there
as
saying
or
it
is
--
it
was
stated
in
the
press
that
the
district
attorney
said
this
and
this.
the
supreme
court
for
the
state
of
california
was
very
careful
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
it
--
it
merely
said
other
statements
which
the
district
attorney
was
reported
to
--
was
reported
to
have
made
where
that
he
had
evidence
of
this
was
not
the
first
time
defendants
sought
to
hire
someone
to
(inaudible)
and
he
goes
on
and
release
certain
--
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was
in
the
case
insofar
as
the
newspaper
publicity
might
have
deprived
these
defendants
for
the
theory
--
mr.
william
e.
james
only
insofar
as
the
district
attorney
admitted
making
one
statement,
he
--
before
the
supreme
court
denied
most
of
those
statements.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
yes
your
honor,
it
certainly
was.
but
whether
the
district
attorney
made
it
and
of
course
the
supreme
court
of
california
wasn't
concerned
with
any
disciplinary
proceedings
whether
the
district
attorney
made
those
statements
or
didn't.
he
denied
most
of
those
statements
and
it
was
acknowledged
by
the
supreme
court.
he
did
admit
some
of
those
statements
and
i'm
going
to
go
through
the
various
exhibits
that
were
presented
to
the
trial
court
because
i
think
it's
important
the
entire
exhibits,
i
believe
are
before
this
court.
they
should
be
before
this
court.
mr.
william
e.
james
well
i
hope
i
will
be
in
the
next
few
minutes
your
honor
because
i
think
it
is
important.
the
charge
before
this
court
is
that
there
was
content
of
the
district
attorney
which
deprived
these
defendants
of
a
right
to
which
they
were
entitled
and
that
was
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
before
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
in
ventura
county.
and
this
was
the
issue
that
head
be
to
decide
it
and
the
court,
the
trial
court
in
california
in
ventura
county
had
this
before
it.
and
maybe
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions
presented
by
the
court
to
mr.
wirin
before
i
go
into
these
exhibits,
i
might
clarify
for
the
court's
purposes
in
considering
this
argument
just
when
these
matters
were
presented
and
by
which
of
these
petitioners.
now
the
first
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
was
made
by
defendant
moya
on
january
the
13th,
1959.
it
was
joined
in
at
that
time
by
defendant
baldonado.
at
that
time,
certain
newspaper
exhibits
to
which
i'll
make
reference,
all
of
those
exhibits
were
from
december
15,
through
i
believe
it
was
either
the
second
or
the
seventh
of
january.
it
was
prior
to
the
13th
of
january.
and
then
--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
indictment
was
filed
on
december
26,
1958
against
charging
all
three
of
these
defendants
with
the
murder
of
olga
duncan.
this
matter
was
argued
on
behalf
of
these
two
defendants
on
january
the
13th,
1959
and
denied
by
the
trial
judge
on
january
15th.
at
that
time,
the
trial
judge
allowed
or
permitted
the
defendants
to
renew
their
motion,
he
stated
he
was
permitting
them
to
renew
their
motion
prior
to
their
trials.
the
trial
at
that
time
of
these
defendants
and
it's
turned
out
of
elizabeth
duncan
was
scheduled
for
february
the
16th.
now
on
february
the
16th,
duncan,
the
petitioner
duncan
made
her
first
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
and
in
that
motion
for
a
change
of
venue,
she
incorporated
by
reference
the
newspaper
exhibits
that
had
been
presented
to
the
court
on
january
the
13th.
and
she
likewise
appended
to
her
application
an
exhibit
to
which
i'll
make
reference
which
contained
certain
news
releases
that
were
in
the
ventura
star
free
press
and
the
oxnard
press
courier
from
the
period
of
january
the
12th
through
approximately
the
period
february
the
2nd,
1959.
and
these
were
the
exhibits
before
the
trial
court.
these
were
the
basis
upon
which
the
trial
court
ruled
on
the
motion
for
change
of
venue.
now
thereafter,
after
the
jury
was
selected
and
it
only
took
about
four
days
to
select
the
jury,
they
only
interrogated
83
prospective
jurors
in
the
duncan
case
which
wasn't
much
for
a
capital
case,
petitioner
duncan,
through
her
counsel,
made
another
change
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
there
was
nothing
additional
presented
and
the
argument
was
merely
proforma
and
it's
recorded
in
the
transcript
before
this
court
and
we
have
made
reference
to
it
in
our
briefs.
now
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
is
contained
in
the
transcript
of
the
duncan
case
as
i
recall,
rather
it's
contained
in
the
transcript
of
all
three
cases
if
i
am
not
recall
on
--
the
exact
sequence
was
i,
it
is
a
said
commentary
and
integrity,
decency
and
humanity
and
the
people
of
ventura
county
to
say
that
the
defendants
whose
very
lives
maybe
at
stake
cannot
receive
the
fair
and
impartial
trial
in
this
county.
now
we
have
put
in
our
brief
and
it
occurred,
this
appeared
in
the
press
i
think
on
the
date
of
the
denial
either
the
15th
of
january,
1959
or
the
16th
of
january.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
the
superior
court
judge
likewise
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
was
initially
appointed
in
1946
by
the
then
governor
and
our
chief
justice
and
he
was
reelected
in
1954,
reelected
in
1948
and
then
1954
as
i
recall.
mr.
william
e.
james
it's
a
six-year
term
for
our
superior
court
judges.
now
the
counsel
tells
me
that
the
statement
that
to
which
you
made
reference,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
in
the
record
at
page
transcript
137
of
the
moya
transcript.
mr.
william
e.
james
after
that,
it
--
it
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
i
will.
your
honor,
if
i
may
just
make
a
brief
reply
to
justice
stewart's
question,
following
that
article
which
is
appearing
on
page
137
of
the
moya
transcript,
the
judge
wrote
a
statement
which
was
published
in
both
the
ventura
county,
star
free
press
and
the
oxnard
press
courier
which
he
said
i
want
to
break
any
false
impression
which
might
have
been
created
by
reason
of
a
statement
made
by
me
in
an
order
denying
a
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
in
the
case
of
people
versus
elizabeth
ann
duncan,
luis
estrada
moya
and
augustine
baldonado.
then
he
says
the
statement
i'm
referring
to
reads
as
follows
and
it
is
as
i
have
read
to
you.
the
judge
then
continues
i
his
statement
which
was
published
in
these
two
newspapers.
by
making
this
statement,
i
intended
in
no
way
whatsoever
to
suggest
that
burt
henson,
counsel
for
defendant
luis
moya
and
john
danch,
counsel
for
defendant
augustine
baldonado
were
attacking
the
integrity,
decency,
or
humanity
of
the
people
of
ventura
county.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall
they
did
not
make
this
exhibit
of
january
the
17th
an
exhibit
in
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
137
of
the
moya
record.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was
just
a
ruling,
i
believe
of
the
court.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
think
it
was
an
order
made
on
the
ruling
on
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
motion
for
change
of
venue.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
he
said
in
substance
but
he
made
a
statement
which
was
published
in
the
papers
so
there
was
no
mistake.
he
was
merely
telling
counsel
that
he
felt
at
that
time
the
people
of
ventura
county
were
capable
of
having
a
jury
that
could
give
these
defendants
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
and
he
was
willing
to
let
the
matter
go
to
a
selection
of
the
jury
which
wasn't
the
fixed
place
for
at
least
a
month
and
then
as
far
as
the
duncan
case
for
a
month
and
as
far
as
baldonado
and
moya
for
a
number
of
months.
so
the
judge
retracted
the
statement
but
he
did.
now
as
i
was
stating
the
petitioner
baldonado
never
renewed
his
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
which
was
made
along
with
moya
on
january
13th.
he
went
to
trial
solely
on
issue
of
penalty
on
april
the
6th.
moya
did
renew
the
application
for
change
of
venue
prior
to
the
trial
which
is
scheduled
on
april
20th.
that
motion
was
made
on
april
the
16th,
1959
and
at
that
time,
additional
newspaper
exhibits
were
presented
to
the
trial
judge
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
the
ruling
of
that
court
on
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
and
i
think
that
we
will
perhaps
serve
everyone's
purpose
if
we
refer
directly
to
those
exhibits
which
i
understand
are
in
the
possession
of
the
court.
they
were
before
the
trial
court.
they
were
the
sole
basis
of
this
claim
made
by
these
petitioners
in
the
trial
court
both
in
at
the
trial
level
and
on
appeal,
automatic
appeal
to
the
state
supreme
court.
now
perhaps
it
would
serve
some
purpose
to
point
out
some
preliminary
matters
since
this
point
--
this
first
point
is
directed
to
what
they
say
the
conduct
of
a
district
attorney
the
resulting
publicity
and
in
other
circumstances
attending
to
crime.
the
case
starts
as
far
as
the
newspaper
publicity
is
concerned
on
about
november
the
17th,
1958
in
santa
barbara
county
when
there
is
a
missing
person's
report.
olga
duncan
who
was
the
wife
of
frank
duncan,
the
son
of
the
petitioner,
elizabeth
duncan,
she
was
the
daughter-in-law
of
elizabeth
duncan.
she
disappeared
under
mysterious
circumstances.
and
the
news
media
in
santa
barbara
county
and
outside
the
santa
barbara
county
was
disseminating
information
concerned
and
it
was
a
matter
of
great
interest,
of
great
news
value.
and
so
there
was
a
series
of
reports
both
in
the
santa
barbara
paper,
in
the
ventura,
the
oxnard
papers
and
the
los
angeles
papers
and
other
papers.
mr.
william
e.
james
from
santa
barbara.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
she
was
living
there.
these
petitioners
with
the
possible
exception
of
baldonado
were
actually
not
residents
of
ventura
county.
the
victim
was
not
a
resident
of
ventura
county.
she
was
a
resident
of
santa
barbara
as
was
her
husband,
frank
duncan,
as
was
her
mother-in-law,
the
petitioner
elizabeth
duncan.
moya
was
also
a
resident
of
that
county.
now
this
is
where
the
news
was
first
emanating.
the
district
attorney
of
ventura
county
or
rather
of
santa
barbara
county
made
certain
statements
in
regard
to
her
disappearance.
the
papers
published
some
report
that
the
police
had
stopped
the
excavation
of
a
street
in
front
or
the
repaving
of
the
street
in
front
of
where
she
resided,
and
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
they
might
recover
her
body.
in
the
course
of
this
time,
a
fact
came
to
light
that
there
had
been
a
fake
annulment
proceedings
instituted
by
petitioner
duncan
posing
as
her
daughter-in-law
olga
duncan
in
ventura
county
and
an
attorney
in
ventura
county
had
suggested
it
to
frank
duncan.
the
facts
came
out
that
at
later
time
--
mr.
william
e.
james
they
were
adjoining
counties,
north
and
west
of
ventura,
santa
barbara
county.
the
annulment
proceeding
was
instituted
in
ventura
county.
elizabeth
duncan
posing
as
her
daughter-in-law
and
a
ralph
winterstein
posing
as
the
son
of
elizabeth
duncan,
frank
duncan
in
this
annulment
proceedings
and
this
made
a
blood
of
publicity
and
there
was
a
lot
of
speculation
in
the
various
papers
in
regard
to
it.
and
so
the
first
newspaper
exhibit
that
was
presented
on
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue
by
defendants
moya
and
joined
in
by
baldonado
went
in
later
by
incorporation
by
reference
in
the
implication
of
petitioner
duncan
was
what
is
exhibit
number
15
which
was
an
issue
of
the
ventura
county
star
free
press
on
monday,
december
15th.
and
in
this
case,
it
is
merely
stated
woman
held
in
disappearance,
mother-in-law
is
key
figure
and
it
relates
the
occurrences
that
i
have
already
referred
to
in
santa
barbara
county.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
your
honor.
she
was
and
that
the
next
exhibit
is
a
los
angeles
herald
express
which
is
exhibit
number
33
which
was
an
issue
of
the
herald
express
of
los
angeles
on
december
15th
with
a
caption,
jailed
lawyer's
mother
as
wife
disappears.
a
fake
annulment
proceeding,
a
prosecution
for
the
fraudulent
annulment
was
instituted
in
ventura
county
against
elizabeth
duncan
and
her
codefendant
and
she
was
convicted
of
it
and
she
is
presently
under
a
sentence
in
the
state
of
california.
mr.
william
e.
james
pardon.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
in
19
--
late
1958.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was,
as
i
understand
it
prior
to
the
prosecution
of
this
case.
this
charge
was
initiated
first.
they
had
not
at
this
time
found
the
body
of
olga
duncan.
so
there
was
no
prosecution
pending
for
murder.
ventura
county
was
not
involved
in
the
murder
case,
it
was
involved
only
insofar
as
there
had
been
a
false
annulment
proceedings
instituted
in
ventura
county.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
--
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
matter
came
to
life
after
olga
duncan
disappeared.
her
disappearance
was
in
november
17th.
now
in
what
is
exhibit
1180
before
this
court,
ventura
county
star
free
press
of
the
tuesday,
december
16th,
there
is
a
statement
of
a
caption
fake
annulment
charge
jails
three,
nurse
is
missing,
and
therein
it
has
related
that
officers
desperately
are
seeking
new
leads
today
in
the
disappearance
of
a
beautiful
santa
barbara
nurse
on
november
17
and
are
holding
a
man
on
suspicion
of
kidnapping
and
her
mother-in-law
on
charges
of
faking
an
annulment
then
relates
it,
investigators

and
also
in
this
exhibit
is
a
statement
lawyer's
query
is
tipped
off
in

and
it
recites
how
an
attorney,
helen
hamann's
the
ventura
was
the
innocent
attorney
who
affected
the
annulment

without
knowing
that
the

the
principles
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
--
he
purportedly
got
an
annulment
for
olga

by
means
of
the

of
elizabeth
duncan
testifying
in

mr.
william
e.
james
well
he
--
he
actually
represented
elizabeth
duncan.
he
thought
he
was
representing
all
of
the
duncan.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
she
was
the
one
who
obtained
the
annulment
proceedings,
olga
knew
nothing
about
this.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
the
exhibit
--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
annulment

as
i
recall
were
filed

august
the
seventh

that
i
have
confirmed
it
with

it's
agreed
that

the
date
that

the
murder
charge.
she
entered
pleas
to
--
pleas
of
guilty
to
two
counts
in
the
fake
annulment
proceedings
and
was
sentenced
accordingly
on
that
date.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
was
after
the
trial
and
after
the
sentence
in
the
murder
case,
april
the
3rd,
1959.
mr.
william
e.
james
third.
thank
you.
now,
i
will
proceed
in
regard
to
these
exhibits.
as
you
recall,
we've
examined
the
exhibits
that
are
--
were
before
the
court
on
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
made
by
petitioner
moya,
joined
in
by
petitioner
baldonado
on
january
the
13th,
1959.
among
the
exhibits
was
the
oxnard
press
courier.
a
town
in
the
ventura
county
close
to
the
city
of
ventura
in
which
on
the
front
pages
headline,
or
rather
not
headline,
the
picture
of
petitioner
duncan
and
it
states,
"daughter-in-law,
missing
impersonation
jails
woman."
this
continued
in
the
other
exhibits
that
were
before
the
court,
exhibit
number

which
was
the
ventura
county
star
free
press

december
17th,
related

and
the
story
is
--
commences
authorities
in
santa
barbara
now
are
convinced
that
all
the
duncan
attractive
three-year-old
nurse
and
wife
of
attorney
frank
duncan
met
with
foul
play.
and
it
continues,
gives
the
facts
which
the
news
media
obtained
which
it
reported
in
the
public
press.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
your
honor.
we
filed
a
brief
in
the
duncan
case,
in
the
baldonado
case
and
the
moya
case,
separate
briefs
in
all
three
cases.
on
december
18th,
the
next
day,
and
this
is
all
prior
to
the
finding
of
--
of
the
victim's
body,
olga
duncan
in
the
ventura
county
star
free
press
which
is
exhibit
number
13
before
the
trial
court
is
the
headline
"ex-convict

for
rolling
duncan
fake
annulment".
da
says
man
post
as
lawyer
and
it
has
a
picture
of
ralph
winterstein
who
is
the
codefendant
with
petitioner
duncan
in
the
fake
annulment
proceedings.
on
the
succeeding
dates
--
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall,
yes.
and
he
testified
in
the
trial
of
elizabeth
duncan
which
occurred
from
february
the
20th
to
the
16th
of
march.
on
december
19th,
exhibit
number
14,
the
ventura
county
star
free
press,
there
is
a
story
on
the
front
page,
"chase
of
the
fake
annulment."
she
witness
gives
da
valuable
information
and
a
story
is
placed
in
the
paper,
they're
concerning
this
fake
annulment
proceeding.
then
on
the
succeeding
day,
saturday,
december
20th,
there
is
the
report
in
the
ventura
county
star
free
press,
december
20th
exhibit
15
(a),
kidnapped
murder
charges
filed
in
case
of
missing
nurse,
mother-in-law,
two
men
held.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
certainly
hope
so
and
i
will
make
an
effort
to
ascertain
if
--
if
they
are
--
i
will
ascertain
if
they
are
and
if
they're
not,
i'll
make
an
effort
to
have
the
original
exhibits
lodge
with
the
court
because
i
don't
see
how
the
court
can
consider
this
matter
without
examining
these
exhibits
and
that's
why
i
have
taken
the
time
to
go
through
these
particular
exhibits
because
this
is
one
of
the
issues
that's
--
before
the
court,
it
was
the
issue
before
the
trial
court
and
it
was
obviously
the
issue
when
the
supreme
court
reviewed
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
on
the
question
of
whether
there
should
have
been
a
change
of
venue
in
this
case
because
of
the
publicity
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
will
if
the
court
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
i'm
planning
to
do
it
unless
the
court
wishes
me
to
stop.
mr.
william
e.
james
there
are
quite
few
more,
your
honor.
these
are
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
these
were
exhibits
which
were
before
the
court
on
moya's
application
for
change
of
venue
made
on
january
the
13th.
mr.
william
e.
james
so
far
there's
been
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
that
was
the
only
news
item
relating
to
the
duncan
proceeding.
obviously
at
this
time,
there
was
no
body
found.
there
was
no
duncan
case
as
such
because
the
authorities
were
searching
for
the
body
of
all
the
duncan
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
unraveled
at
the
time
was
this
fake
annulment.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
these
are
exhibits
that
were
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
i
haven't
finished
them
yet.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
this
is
before
the
body
was
found.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
three
of
them
were
under
arrest
beginning
december
12th,
mrs.
duncan
on
the
fake
annulment
proceedings,
moya
as
a
parole
violator
and
petitioner
baldonado
on
a
charge
of
failure
to
support.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
and
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
she
knew
--
mr.
william
e.
james
bail
was
set
at
$50,000
as
i
recall
and
on
motion
of
attorney
frank
duncan,
it
was
reduced.
and
i
believe
it
was
reduced
to
$5000.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
the
--
the
authorities
were
then
looking
for
a
body
--
was
there
a
question
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
believe
so.
it's
my
recollection
she
did
not.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
exhibit
which
i
--
it
is
15
(a),
it
relates
the
weird
olga
duncan
disappearance
case
took
an
important
turn
late
yesterday
in
santa
barbara,
when
her
mother-in-law
and
two
men
were
charged
with
conspiracy
to
commit
murder
and
kidnapping.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
the
date
of
december
20th.
this
is
saturday,
december
20th,
1958.
mr.
william
e.
james
in
--
in
santa
barbara
county,
not
ventura
county.
mr.
william
e.
james
before
the
finding
of
the
body.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
finding
of
the
body
was
on
the
21st.
mr.
william
e.
james
--
next
day
sunday.
this
is
saturday,
december
20th,
the
body
had
not
been
found,
however,
in
--
in
joining
county
of
santa
barbara,
those
conspiracy
charges
were
filed.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
after
the
--
early
after
the
19th,
she
was
under
conspiracy
charge
in
santa
barbara.
mr.
william
e.
james
ordinarily
not.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
proceeded
as
i
recall.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
newspaper
exhibits,
as
i
remember,
detail
the
attempt
to
reduce
the
bail.
mr.
william
e.
james
moya.
mr.
william
e.
james
they
were
referred
by
reference
as
i
recall,
and
mrs.
duncan's
application
had
additionally
certain
excerpts
from
the
ventura
county
star
free
press
and
the
oxnard
press
courier
succeeding
january
7th
when
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
she
was
under
indictment
for
murder
as
of
december
26.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
your
honor.
now,
on
december
21st,
the
body
was
found,
baldonado
confessed
and
he
led
the
authorities
to
a
part
of
ventura
county
which
was
a
remote
part
and
the
body
was
found
in
a
shallow
grave.
now,
this
was
reported
in
the
press
--
mr.
william
e.
james
baldonado
confessed
and
took
the
authorities
to
where
the
body
was
found.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
confessed,
as
i
recall,
in
ventura.
mr.
william
e.
james
after
--
after
the
con
--
an
indictment
for
conspiracy.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was
the
succeeding
day
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
or
the
saturday
paper
reported
the
filing
of
the
conspiracy
charge
in
santa
barbara
friday,
and
sunday
he
confessed
and
led
the
authorities
to
the
crime,
and
exhibit
number
30
which
is
the
--
an
issue
of
the
los
angeles
times
of
december
22nd
contains
two
articles
relating
to
this
matter.
one,
relates,
body
and
missing
bride
on
earth
may
have
been
buried
alive,
man
confesses,
points
to
grave,
contains
a
story
of
the
confession
of
finding
of
the
body,
a
picture
of
the
victim
as
well
as
one
of
the
defendants.
also,
in
the
same
issue
of
the
los
angeles
times,
is
a
little
chronology
which
is
captioned
police
reconstruct
kidnap
murder
events.
now,
this
is
police
reconstruct
the
kidnap
murder
event.
so
far,
there's
certainly
been
no
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
to
which
we
have
reference
to
and
to
which
this
court
limited
the
granting
of
certiorari
on
the
question
of
publicity
and
the
question
whether
the
defendants
could
obtain
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
for
their
trials
in
february
and
april
of
1959.
on
december
22nd,
monday,
which
is
exhibit
3,
which
has
been
referred
to
by
counsel
for
petitioners
and
has
been
incorporated
in
one
of
their
briefs
is
the
issue
of
ventura
county
star
free
press
of
monday,
december
22nd,
in
which
it
is
related
that
olga's
body
found
in
county,
nurse
was
beaten,
strangled.
and
a
news
report
relating
that
suspect
admits
murder
for
hire
in
casitas'
place.
now,
in
the
separate
article
on
the
same
page,
on
the
same
date,
is
a
headline
which
reads,
"da
urges
death
term
in
killings."
(inaudible)
plurally
writer
of
the
caption
and
i
believe
counsel
for
these
petitioners
have
said
that
they
do
not
attribute
to
the
district
attorney
the
headline
or
the
caption
on
any
article.
but
the
caption
was
written
by
one
who
understood
this
as
a
statement
of
the
district
attorney
about
his
position
on
capital
punishment,
nothing
more.
and
he,
at
this
time,
it
says,
"the
district
attorney,
roy
gustafson,
today
saw
the
duncan
murder
as
a
reason
for
continuation
of
california's
death
penalty."
he
issued
the
following
statement,
and
then
it
relates
what
is
set
forth
in
this
addition
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
now,
we
submit
that
this
is
a
statement
of
the
district
attorney
in
relation
to
his
position
on
capital
punishment,
and
as
we
point
in
one
of
the
later
exhibits,
he
had
a
purpose
in
doing
it.
petitioners
would
say,
it
was
a
sinister
purpose.
it
was
not,
it
was
because
he
is
one
of
the
outspoken
advocates
of
retention
of
capital
punishment
in
california.
the
legislature
within
a
short
week
and
a
half
we're
going
to
meet
and
as
we'll
see
in
one
of
the
exhibits,
the
--
there
were
to
be
two
measures
which
were
going
to
be
quite
important
measures
before
that
legislative
session
in
regard
to
abolition
of
capital
punishment.
and
so
the
district
attorney
was
making
his
statement
in
regard
to
proposed
to
a
pending
legislation.
and
there's
nowhere
in
here
any
relation
to
his
asking
that
the
citizens
of
ventura
county
arise
against
these
particular
defendants.
he
is
merely
making
his
statement
urging
that
the
people
retain
as
one
of
two
alternative
punishments
in
california
for
murders,
the
death
penalty.
and
that's
what
it
is,
pure
and
simple.
that's
what
the
district
attorney
said
it
was.
that
was
accepted
by
the
trial
judge
in
his
ruling
thereon
was
accepted
by
the
states
upon
report.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
obviously,
if
any
statement
by
district
attorney
so
inflamed
the
minds
of
prospective
jurors
in
ventura
county
that
they
could
not
render
a
fair
verdict
and
give
the
defendant
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
the
purposes
of
a
district
attorney
would
have
no
consequence.
but
we're
merely
pointing
this
out
to
show
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
that
the
district
attorney
wasn't
calculating
here.
they
scribed
to
the
district
attorney
some
sinister
purpose
here
to
obtain
for
these
defendants
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
well
as
other
cases.
mr.
william
e.
james
unfortunately,
we
have
a
number
in
--
in
the
state
of
california.
and
he
referred
i
believe
in
one
statement
to
the
glatman
case
which
was
a
--
a
case
that
received
a
great
deal
of
notoriety.
the
defendant
there
killed
three
women
before
he
was
apprehended
in
the
process
of
strangling
a
fourth.
and
he
had
also
obtained
the
death
penalty
and
i
think
the
district
attorney
took
occasion
to
make
reference
to
that.
now,
on
december
23rd,
exhibit
number
31,
there
is
an
article
in
the
los
angeles
times
which
relates
the
--
relates
as
to
the
murder
case
in
ventura
county
and
it
says,
"blackmail
charged
in
bride
slayer."
and
also
relates
and
we've
referred
to
it
in
our
briefs
to
a
statement
made
by
defense
counsel.
defense
counsel
was
making
statements
of
this
time
and
it
refers
to
mr.
sullivan
who
represented
the
petitioner
duncan
it
said,
sullivan
who
talked
for
two
hours
to
mrs.
elizabeth
duncan
54
today,
said
tonight,
"i
firmly
believe
that
these
two
men
maintained
a
bitter
grudge
towards
the
duncan
family
and
they
resorted
to
murder
in
an
attempt
to
blackmail
this
poor
woman."
now,
the
news
media
were
reporting
just
exactly
what
occurred.
they
reported
the
confession
of
baldonado,
the
finding
of
the
body,
the
fact
that
olga
was
murdered.
they
later
reported
the
confession
of
moya
which
occurred
on
or
about
christmas
day
in
1958.
they
reported
that
the
petitioner
duncan
said
she
was
innocent.
they
reported
that
the
petitioner's
attorney
thought
she
was
innocent.
certainly,
there's
been
no
slanting
of
the
press
in
this
regard.
there
could
be
no
claim
that
the
people
were
so
prejudice
against
these
defendants
that
they
could
not
fairly
and
impartially
consider
evidence
presented
at
a
trial
to
be
held
a
month
and
a
half
later
and
more
than
that
in
the
case
of
mrs.
duncan
and
solely
on
the
penal
--
on
the
penalty
issue
in
april
as
to
duncan,
as
to
baldonado
and
moya.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
believe
it
was
released
by
the
authorities.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
and
i'll
come
to
some
exhibits
where,
as
i
recall
the
los
angeles
times
printed
a
good
segment,
perhaps
a
good
part
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings
after
it
become
a
matter
of
public
record.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall,
it
was.
i
recall
that
both
moya
and
baldonado
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
provision
redundant
did
not
--
mr.
william
e.
james
once
the
indictment
has
been
filed
and
the
transcript
is
prepared
to
become
the
public
record
of
california.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
a
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
it
becomes
a
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
a
matter
of
public
record.
somebody
can
go
and
look
at
it.
it's
available
to
the
press
as
well
as
to
any
other
member
of
the
public.
and
it
was
reported
both
in
the
los
angeles
times.
it
was
summarized
in
some
of
the
other
papers
to
which
i'll
make
reference.
i
believe
on
december
22nd,
there
are
two
issues
of
the
los
angeles
herald
express
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
say
at
least
65
miles
away
from
ventura
where
it
is
headlined
and
this
is
exhibit
number
10
which
was
an
exhibit
before
the
grand
jury.
the
los
angeles
herald
express
of
monday,
december
22nd,
mother's
love
hate
seen
in
bride
killing.
i
mean
it
contains
the
picture
of
the
two
defendants,
baldonado
and
moya
and
a
story
in
regard
to
the
finding
of
the
body
of
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
confession.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
exhibit
number
10
which
was
one
of
the
exhibits
as
i
recall
presented
in
the
moya
application
for
change
of
venue.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
of
course
secret
but
the
testimony
becomes
a
matter
of
public
record
when
the
indictments
filed
in
the
transcript
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
is
filed
with
the
court
and
the
copy
served
on
the
defendants.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
no
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
by
the
authorities
which
will
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
as
i
recall
was
the
sheriff's
office
in
ventura
county.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
i
refer
in
one
of
these
exhibits
and
of
course,
all
that
the
trial
court
had
before
it
except
what
it
knew,
what
it
could
possibly
take
judicial
knowledge
of,
where
these
newspaper
reports.
there
was,
of
course,
reference
the
radio
and
the
other
news
media
including
television
carried
news
accounts
concerning
these
events
of
transporting
in
santa
barbara.
mr.
william
e.
james
no
reference
in
the
exhibits
that
i've
referred
to
in
the
present.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
record
does
contain
a
news
reference
to
this
confession
of
moya
which
was
obtained
by
discovery
proceedings
by
counsel
from
moya.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
was
broadcast,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
newspaper
exhibit
shows
it
was
broadcast.
mr.
william
e.
james
in
fact,
it
announced
the
time
that
it
would
be
broadcast
and
the
station
that
it
would
be
broadcast.
mr.
william
e.
james
everyone
could
turn
the
radio
on.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
was
done
at
the
instance
of
counsel
for
defendant
moya.
this
was
not
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
and
this
occurred
long
after
these
two
items
that
have
been
the
subject
of
so
much
criticism
on
the
part
of
these
petitioners.
mr.
william
e.
james
california
has
discovery
proceedings
whereby
a
confession
given
by
a
defendant
may
be
obtained
by
defense
counsel
in
order
to
prepare
for
his
trial.
mr.
william
e.
james
early
he
did.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
had
counsel.
mr.
william
e.
james
i'll
skip
ahead
a
little
bit
to
this
time
because
you
ask
this
question,
justice
frankfurter.
this
is
exhibit
number
a4
which
was
an
exhibit
on
the
application
of
moya
on
april
16th,
because
this
happened
after
his
motion
for
change
of
venue
made
on
january
13.
this
is
the
exhibit
a4
which
is
dated
january
29th,
1959.
it's
a
ventura
county
star
free
press.
the
headline
of
this
article
is,
"moya
admits
nurse's
murder"
and
it
contains
the
sub
caption,
"insanity,
his
sole
defense
for
slayer."
it
has
a
picture
of
defendant
moya,
his
counsel,
mr.
henson,
and
then
in
a
separate
story,
attorney
explains
move
criticizes
da's
actions,
in
part
of
the
criticism
which
was
apparently
a
press
statement
by
counsel
representing
moya
is
one
thing
that
troubles
me
about
this
case
is
the
fact
that
the
district
attorney
appears
to
be
following
a
course
of
selective
prosecution
and
selective
retribution.
it
appears
as
so
the
district
attorney
is
again
deciding
who
is
to
be
prosecuted
and
who
will
be
a
target
of
retribution.
and
it
continues
on
in
that
same
thing
complaining
that
the
district
attorney
had
not
filed
charges
against
an
--
an
additional
person
who
introduced
moya
and
baldonado
to
mrs.
duncan
in
santa
barbara.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
counsel
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
this
was
quite
a
bit
after.
this
is
january
29.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was
after.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
we
haven't
come
to
the
second
item
that
they
have
criticism
of
the
item
appearing
in
the
ventura
star
free
press
of
december
30th.
but
on
this
--
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
was
in
december.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
it
wouldn't
have
been
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
it
would
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
now
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
it
becomes
an
official
court
record
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
which
is
available
to
any
member
of
the
public
and
the
press
as
member
of
the
public.
but
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
to
answer
justice
frankfurter's
question
in
regard
to
this
radio
broadcast,
this
is,
as
i
say
a4,
the
exhibit
of
thursday,
january
29th,
ventura
county
start
to
be
pressed.
right
next
to
the
column
in
which
the
district
attorney
is
criticized
by
one
of
defense
counsel,
because
he
didn't
institute
charges
against
additional
defendants.
it
says,
"moya
confession
broadcast
set."
this
is
the
front
page
of
the
paper.
"luis
moya's
christmas
night
confession
of
the
slang
of
all
the
duncan
will
be
broadcast
by
a
tape
recording
tonight
at
7
o'clock
on
kudu,
ventura,
1590
kilo
cycles."
moya's
confession
was
recorded
by
sheriffs'
officers
and
was
then
released
to
his
attorney
burt
henson
who
rerecorded
it
and
gave
the
recording
to
kudu
station
spokesman
said
today.
henson
recorded
a
prologue
and
epilogue
with
the
confession.
that
concludes
the
news
announcement.
now
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
obtained
a
court
order,
as
i
recall.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
certainly
could
have
obtained
a
court
order
for
production
of
any
statement
of
the
defendant
in
order
to
avail
himself
of
the
means
of
preparing
for
any
trial.
and
of
course,
he
was
then
preparing
for
a
trial
on
the
penalty
issue.
he
had
pled
guilty.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
confession
of
moya
was
referred
to
as
a
christmas
night
confession
which
must
have
been
december
25th,
1958.
it
was
referred
to
in
the
press
of
december
26
and
--
mr.
william
e.
james
between
the
26th
and
the
29th
of
january
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
26
of
december
and
the
29th
of
january.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
yes,
this
was
an
--
as
i
pointed
out,
this
was
at
a
time
after
his
first
application
for
change
of
venue,
it
became
an
exhibit
before
the
court
on
moya's
second
application
for
change
of
venue
which
took
place
on
april
the
16th
as
i
recall
a
few
days
before
his
trial
on
the
penalty
phase
was
scheduled.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
as
you'll
see
from
examining
the
exhibits,
it
wasn't
front
page
all
the
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
it
was
front
page
news
during
the
period
of
her
being
missing.
mr.
william
e.
james
while
--
while
it
was
a
mystery,
while
there
was
speculation
in
the
public
press
and
the

it
was

it
continue
--
mr.
william

james
from
time
to
time
when
the
matters
were

was
scheduled
for
court
hearing,
it
was
published
on
the
front
page.
as
you
will
see
from
examining
some
of
the
exhibits,
it
was
relegated
to
the
second
and
third
pages
from
time
to
time,
and
was
not
as
fully
covered
by
the
press
when
the
trials
commenced
by
then
the
news
coverage.
particularly
the
trial
of
mrs.
duncan,
there
was
news
coverage
with
by
press

and
other
news

of
the

of

that
was

relates
the
fact
that

this
is

this
is
the

which
is

in
the

or

made
on

by
defendant
moya
and
joined
in
by
defendant
baldonado.
and
it
was
also
incorporated
by
reference
as
i
recall
in
the
application
for
change
of
venue
made
by
petitioner
duncan
on
february
the
16th.
now,
the
front
page
contains
the
report,
the
summary
of
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
on
the
interior
page,
page
6,
the
caption
of
the
headline
continues
the
testimony
in
duncan
murder
revealed.
and
on
a
separate,
in
the
separate
article
on
the
same
page,
is
the
second
article,
which
is
attributed
to
the
district
attorney
in
which
counsel
for
these
petitioners
are
so
critical
and
it
is
captioned
and
they
don't
blame
the
district
attorney
for
the
caption
but
the
caption
is,
"roy
gustafson
explains
why
yell
asked
death
penalty
for
duncan
murder
trio."
now,
as
it
will
be
seen
by
an
examination
of
these
exhibits
a
full
month
later,
the
district
attorney
had
still
not
told
the
press
that
he
was
going
to
ask
for
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
and
as
you
read
the
story,
you
will
see
that
the
district
attorney
is
again
merely
giving
his
reasons
why
he
thinks
capital
punishment
should
be
retained
in
california.
and
he
describes
the
purposes
of
punishment
and
he
gives
to
retribution
a
--
a
prime
position
and
relegates
to
a
lesser
ground
rehabilitation
and
protection
of
the
public.
but
it's
strictly
a
statement
by
the
district
attorney
in
regard
to
capital
punishment
a
matter
that
was
to
be
before
the
state
legislature
to
which
was
to
convene
in
a
matter
of
few
days.
now
--
mr.
william
e.
james
there
is
--
they
had
no
complaint
that
i
know
of
that
there
was
slanting
of
the
news.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall,
there
were
some
editorials
that
appeared
both
in
the
oxnard
press
courier
and
also
in
the
ventura
county
star
free
press
in
regard
to
capital
punishment.
mr.
william
e.
james
they
have
been
referred
to.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
as
we
will
see,
these
particular
exhibit
8
is
interesting
for
a
number
of
reasons
on
the
back
page
which
is
page
number
14
is
one
of
a
number,
i
believe
three
letters
to
the
editor
in
response
to
the
statement
by
the
district
attorney
on
capital
punishment
which
had
appeared
in
this
paper
on
december
22nd.
and
all
three
of
them,
took
a
position
opposite
than
--
from
the
district
attorney
on
the
issue
of
whether
capital
punishment
should
be
retained
in
california.
and
it
obviously
was
clear
that
the
district
attorney
was
merely
making
his
statement
on
capital
punishment
or
was
publishing
the
paper,
letters
by
people
who
disagreed
with
the
district
attorney's
position
on
capital
punishment.
there
was
no
intent.
there
was
no
campaign
to
require
or
to
force
the
jury
in
ventura
county
to
render
the
death
penalty
in
the
cases
of
these
three
defendants.
they
were
now
defendants
but
they
obviously
had
not
been
convicted.
they
were
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
and
that's
what
they
were
going
to
get.
on
the
same
page
as
the
district
attorney's
statement
in
regard
to
capital
punishment
is
the
little
caption,
"duncan
defender
hits
da."
and
it
says
district
attorney
roy
gustafson
was
accused
of
going
along
way
to
prejudice
and
jury
that
might
hear
the
duncan
murder
case.
the
accusation
came
from
mrs.
elizabeth
duncan's
defense
attorney,
s.
ward
sullivan
who
charged
that
gustafson's
public
statements
using
this
case
as
an
argument
in
favor
of
capital
punishment
are
a
very
obvious
effort
to
influence
a
verdict.
his
remark
sullivan
said,
certainly
will
influence
potential
jurors
in
ventura
county.
gustafson
is
going
a
long
way
to
see
that
these
defendants
do
not
receive
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
of
the
hands
of
an
unbiased
and
unprejudiced
jury.
now,
this
was
--
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
december
30th,
1958.
they
were
already
announcing
their
proposed
grounds
in
the
event
of
a
conviction.
they
obviously
haven't
even
attempted
to
find
if
they
could've
obtained
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
in
ventura
county.
they
were
already
announcing
that
they
could.
well
obviously,
a
fair
reading
of
all
of
these
exhibits
which
the
trial
judge
did
would
not
convince
anybody
that
the
citizens
of
ventura
county
will
become
so
in
plain
by
these
two
articles
on
capital
punishment.
they
couldn't'
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
in
the
trial
as
to
petitioner
duncan
on
the
issue
of
guilt
and
penalty
and
as
to
the
penalty
issue
on
the
defendants
moya
and
baldonado.
mr.
william
e.
james
well
of
course,
all
of
the
news
media
at
this
time
and
this
is
on
december
30th
were
reporting
only
what
were
--
was
the
fact
and
that
was
that
moya
confessed
and
baldonado
had
confessed
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
true.
but
this
was
a
matter
of
interest
to
the
press.
the
press
was
publishing.
there
is
no
claim
that
the
press
did
not
publish
what
was
false.
that
the
--
that
there
was
false
publication
in
the
press.
the
press
published
what
was
the
fact
and
if
the
hearing
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
your
honor.
there
--
these
defendants
were
entitled
of
fair
and
impartial
trial
by
jurors
who,
if
they
had
formed
any
opinion
from
these
newspaper
clippings
would
be
able
to
put
those
opinions
aside
and
decide
the
case
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
produced
at
the
trial
and
the
instructions
as
given
to
them
by
the
court.
now
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
contending
that.
we're
contending
that
the
district
attorney
did
not
play
any
part
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
there
--
all
we
have
is
what
is
related
in
the
press.
that's
all
i've
been
reading
to
you
is
what
is
related
in
the
press.
now
--
mr.
william
e.
james
there
is
a
denial
made
by
him.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
he
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
that
he
submitted
this
confession?
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
--
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall,
he
denied
that
he
made
most
of
these
statements
attributed
to
him.
mr.
william
e.
james
he
admitted
--
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall,
he
did
not
at
the
time
of
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue.
his
position
was
if
the
circulation
of
these
news
items
were
such
that
it
would
inflame
the
potential
jurors
in
ventura
county
that
they,
on
february
the
16th
could
not
render
a
fair
and
impartial
jury.
mr.
william
e.
james
there
were
some
that
could.
there
were
some
that
couldn't.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
recall
that.
mr.
william
e.
james
not
that
--
as
i
recall
the
sheriff's
office
--
mr.
william
e.
james
public
authorities
--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
sheriff's
office
as
i
recall
the
confession.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
--
that's
correct
as
i
recall
it.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
your
honor.
they
criticize
the
release
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well
i
don't
know
where
--
where
it
is,
of
it.
their
charge
was
that
the
article
which
appeared
in
the
december
22nd
issue
of
the
ventura
star
free
press,
which
the
district
attorney
said
that
he
was
advocating
death
penalty
in
all
killings,
in
killings
as
related.
now,
the
district
attorney
admitted
making
that
statement.
mr.
william
e.
james
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
authorities
as
i
recall
--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
sheriff's
office.
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
not
necessarily.
as
i
recall
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
is
the
chief
law
officer
for
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
he
doesn't
necessarily
control
the
police
officials
nor
does
he
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
he
is
a
prosecutor.
he
prosecutes
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
my
--
mr.
william
e.
james
they
are
part
of
the
law
enforcement
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
personnel
of
the
state.
and
the
sheriff
of
course
is
the
law
enforcement
officer
of
the
county.
but
the
prosecutor,
the
district
attorney
and
county
counsel
as
he
was
in
ventura
county
performs
illegal
functions
and
when
a
charge
is
brought,
he
prosecutes
it
in
the
court.up
until
that
time,
he
may
or
may
not
have
any
control
over
the
case.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
recall
it
sir.
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
still
the
issues
was
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
were
these
publications
that
we
have
gone
over
so
much
briefly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
e.
james
is
that
--
the
district
attorney
said
that
the
people
in
ventura
county
should
retain
capital
punishment
for
choice.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
is
right.
mr.
william
e.
james
no.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall,
all
he
did
was
he
admitted
making
this
one
statement
in
regard
to
capital
punishment.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
recall
it
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
it
wasn't
because
the
authorities
probably
did.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
the
sheriff's
office
undoubtedly
turned
over
to
the
press,
whatever
news,
item
they
had
of
public
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right
and
that's
what
i
--
when
i
commenced
my
argument
on
this
particular
point,
i
said
that
actually
the
conduct
of
the
district
attorney
was
really
not
put
an
issue
at
the
trial
court.
mr.
william
e.
james
well
--
mr.
william
e.
james
obviously
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
your
honor,
actually,
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
believe
it's
the
affidavit
of
mr.
henson
that
was
filed
with
the
application
for
change
of
venue
on
december
13
--
on
january
13.
mr.
william
e.
james
obviously,
the
district
attorney
was
not
required
at
that
time
to
make
any
these
statements.
this
was
pure
rank
hearsay
at
this
stage.
and
the
only
question
before
the
trial
judge
was
--
was
the
dissemination
of
--
of
these
articles,
whether
they
were
true
of
false,
whether
--
whether
the
district
attorney
had
said
it
or
whether
he
hence
said
it
was
immaterial.
the
question
was
would
this
have
so
inflame
the
citizens
of
ventura
county
that
they
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
and
then
the
news
media
has
published
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'll
agree
with
you.
i
will
say
and
why
i
said
it
was
not
an
issue
at
the
time.
the
district
attorney
was
merely
putting
at
that
time
that
he
issued
the
question
on
which
was
the
pertinent
one
to
the
trial
judge
on
the
motion
for
change
of
venue
where
these
articles
of
such
a
nature
regardless
of
whether
they
correctly
quoted
who
gave
them
the
information
or
where
the
information
came
or
what
it
was.
the
only
thing
was
would
it
have
so
inflamed
to
minds
the
potential
jurors
in
this
particular
case
since
they
could
not
render
a
fair
and
impartial
trial.
now,
the
district
attorney
contended
himself
solely
with
this
particular
question
at
the
argument
before
the
state
supreme
court.
he
denied
making
most
of
these
statements,
and
he
explained
why
he
hadn't
previously
denied
it.
mr.
william
e.
james
the
reply
brief,
as
i
understand
it
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
before
the
state
supreme
court
is
lodged
with
this
court
now
which
continues
the
full
argument
of
the
district
attorney
before
the
state
supreme
court
where
he
made
his
denial
on
most
of
the
statements
and
he
explained
why
he
hand
--
and
he
had
a
question
post
to
him,
similar
to
the
one
post
to
me
now
by
justice
frankfurter.
why
hadn't
he
made
this
denial
before?
and
he
explained
that
at
that
time,
he
didn't
feel
that
it
was
an
issue.
that
the
issue
at
that
time
was
--
could
these
defendants
obtain
a
fair
and
impartial
jury
in
ventura
county?
and
he
solely
directed
himself
to
it
considering
all
of
these
articles
in
which
i
have
been
referring
as
rank
hearsay
on
whether
the
--
they
truthfully
related
what
the
facts
were.
mr.
william
e.
james
on
the
juror,
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
i'm
glad
you
reminded
me
over
it
at
this
time.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
have
realized
how
it
had
been
running.
i
have
just
some
brief
references
that
i
might
make
to
these
other
exhibits.
and
as
i
say,
i
will
ascertain
if
they
are
before
the
court,
because
these
are
the
exhibits
which
formed
the
basis
of
these
defendants'
applications
for
change
of
venue.
they
were
the
matters
before
the
trial
court
and
upon
which
he
ruled
as
to
whether
there
should
have
been
a
change
of
venue
in
this
case
and
certainly,
the
trial
judge
could
have
taken
in
the
consideration
his
own
experience
and
the
fact
that
jurors
would
not
be
inflamed
by
the
articles
that
appeared
here.
he
could
take
cognizance
of
the
fact
that
for
the
most
part,
these
articles
merely
related
the
facts
without
any
slanting.
and
as
far
as
i
know
so
far,
there's
been
no
claim
that
there
was
slanting
of
any
newspaper
reports.
and
you
will
see
as
you
read
through
these
exhibits
as
they
continue
on,
pictures
of
defense
counsel.
in
fact,
there
is
one
article
which
contains
a
very
nice
story
giving
a
biography
of
defense
counsel
for
petitioner
duncan.
mr.
sullivan
give
--
relates
his
long
and
distinguished
career
before
the
bar.
there
is
also
an
article
of
the
district
attorney.
it's
quite
evident
and
the
petitioners
here
have
never
been
able
to
establish
that
there
was
any
slanting
of
the
news
here.
there
was
a
fair
and
full
news
disclosure.
the
news
media
was
not
perverted
or
slanted
by
anyone,
nor
particularly
not
by
the
district
attorney.
and
obviously
these
defendants
could
and
did
get
a
fair
jury
trial
in
ventura
county.
on
february
the
16th,
many,
many
days
have
gone
by
from
the
first
publication
of
these
articles
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
since
the
first
article
was
december
15,
a
total
of
63
days
had
gone
by.
obviously,
the
trial
judge
on
his
ruling
on
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
could
consider
that
jurors
would
have
forgotten
as
it's
already
been
said,
most
people
barely
read
the
news.
and
obviously,
they
retained
the
news
for
only
a
short
period
of
time.
it
served
no
purpose
to
rule
at
ventura
county,
the
citizens
of
ventura
county
and
there's
been
some
reference
that
it's
a
rural
county.
well
obviously,
it's
not
a
rural
county.
on
the
1960
census,
it
had
almost
200,000
population
of
the
58
counties
in
california
which
is
a
fairly
populous
state.
it
ranked
number
15
among
the
county,
so
it
was
not
a
rural
county
in
california.
and
obviously,
the
jury
panels
were
not
exhausted.
if
the
jury
panels
were
exhausted
before
they
could
have
gotten
any
jury,
this
would
have
any
good
basis
--
mr.
william
e.
james
there's
only
--
no
there
was
more,
they
did
not
exhaust
their
jury
panel.
they
had,
i
believe
150
on
the
duncan.
they
only
interrogated
83
prospective
jurors
in
the
duncan
case.
they
interrogated
approximately
70
in
the
moya
case
and
only
61
in
the
baldonado
case.
and
they
didn't
--
mr.
william
e.
james
there,
i
believe
there
are
about
28
altogether.
i
have
the
figure
somewhere
if
the
court
would
like
them.
there
were
a
number
of
course
in
the
duncan
case,
i
think
there
were
23
who
were
excused
on
the
california
law
because
they
entertained
conscientious
scrupulous
against
the
death
penalty.
mr.
william
e.
james
a
number
who
had
formed
opinions.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
believe
so.
there
were
some
who
would
form
the
opinions
and
they
were
excused
for
cause.
mr.
william
e.
james
that
was
--
there
were
two
holds
--
holds
in
the
duncan
case.
mr.
william
e.
james
one
said
she
had
no
fixed
opinion
and
she
remained
as
a
juror.
there
was
--
mr.
william
e.
james
who
i
will
refer
to.
she
had
a
sorority
system.
mr.
william
e.
james
she
sat
on
the
jury
and
she
was
not
challenge
for
cause.
and
perhaps
as
my
time
is
fleeting
fast,
i
might
be
true
to
that
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
in
regard
to
these
exhibits.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
believe,
and
i
believe
the
district
attorney
also
in
his
affidavit
which
succeeds
on
nine
and
10
and
11
also
specifically
did
not
--
mr.
william
e.
james
not
that
i
know
in
the
record,
it
was
never
cleared
up.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes.
mr.
william
e.
james
but
on
page
10,
he
specifically
denies
the
statement
this
crime
is
one
of
the
most
vicious
and
horrible
in
the
annals
of
modern
justice.
he
says
either
the
falling
statement
or
anything
resembling
it
was
ever
made
by
--
by
means
anytime.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
i
think
he
was
in
the
first
same
in
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
setting
up
what
was
the
article
that
appeared
in
the
december
22nd
issue
of
the
ventura
star
free
press,
which
related
to
capital
punishment
in
which
he
admitted
making
and
which
he
gave
us
his
reason
that
he
was
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
making
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well
he
was
--
he
was
referring
to
crimes
in
that
caliber
and
i
think
in
a
later
quoted
statement
in
the
press,
they
--
he
refers
to
other
crimes
of
a
similar
nature.
now
as
i
say,
before
i
pass
this
point,
the
exhibits
which
i
assume
are
before
the
court,
i
think
the
court
will
want
to
read
because
obviously
as
you
read
those
exhibits,
the
references
to
which
we
made
to
defense
counsel
statement,
it
will
become
manifestly
clear
that
there
was
no
conduct
by
the
district
attorney
as
such
which
resulted
in
publicity
and
which
prevented
these
defendants
from
obtaining
in
ventura
county
their
impartial
jury.
now,
turning
to
the
point
to
which
the
duncan
matter
relates
and
which
relates
not
at
all
to
the
other
two
cases
and
that
was
the
question
certified
on
the
granting
of
certiorari
in
this
case,
was
the
petitioner's
right
to
a
fair
trial
is
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
denied?
was
there
a
violation
where
in
a
trial
of
a
capital
offense
by
jury?
the
trial
court
permitted
to
remain
in
the
jury
box
and
sit
in
judgment
three
jurors
who
would
enter
the
jury
box
with
fixed
opinions
as
to
petitioner's
deal
and
retain
such
opinions
while
being
examined
on
voir
dire.
well
obviously,
the
petitioner
here
had
overstated
herself
in
her
application
for
certiorari
because
there
was
no
permitting
by
the
trial
judge
in
this
case.
there
was
never
any
motion,
there
was
never
any
challenge
for
causing
interpose,
challenge
of
any
nature
interpose
by
petitioner
duncan
as
to
these
three
jurors
who
sat
hall,
bertsch
and
horrell.
and
obviously,
the
statement
that
they
entered
the
jury
box
with
fixed
opinions
and
retained
such
opinions
while
being
examined
on
voir
dire
is
not
supported
by
the
record.
it
obviously
wasn't
the
question
addressed
to
these
particular
jurors
or
not
post
by
the
district
attorney
in
this
so-called
technique
that's
been
referred
to
the
district
attorney.
they
were
post
by
defense
counsel
himself
in
the
case
of
ms.
hall,
who
ms.
hall
who
sat
and
not
the
ms.
hall
who
was
excused.
this
is
the
question,
"do
you
know
of
any
reason
whatsoever
why
you
could
not
be
fair
and
impartial
as
a
trial
juror
in
this
case?
answer,
"no
sir,
i
do
not."
mr.
sullivan,
"no
further
questions."
the
court,
"did
you
pass
for
a
cause?"
mr.
sullivan,
"yes,
your
honor."
and
this
is
page
648
of
the
transcript
in
the
duncan
case.
now
obviously,
these
petitioners
have
no
case
here
on
these
either
points.
they
made
no
effort
to
preserve
this
constitutional
point
as
they
assert
it
in
the
trial
court.
they
made
no
effort
to
raise
it
in
the
automatic
appeal
in
the
state
supreme
court.
i
understand
that
there's
been
lodged
with
this
--
this
court.
the
briefs
filed
on
behalf
of
petitioner
duncan
in
the
state
supreme
court.
i
have
here
my
copy
of
the
appellant's
opening
brief.
the
first
point
is
the
trial
court
committed
prejudicial
error
in
disallowing
appellants'
challenges
for
cause
for
actual
bias.
now,
this
is
--
this
is
contending
that
the
court
erred
in
not
allowing
the
cause,
the
challenges
for
cause
as
to
the
four
jurors
to
which
reference
has
been
made.
no
claim
as
to
these
three
jurors
and
find
(voice

--
mr.
william
e.
james
they
weren't
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
they
weren't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
not
necessarily.
obviously,
our
position
is
the
trial
court
was
not
wrong
as
to
the
four
and
we
have
stated
that
in
our
briefs.
the
state
supreme
court
went
into
this
matter.
this
was
the
issue
before
the
state
supreme
court
and
i
think
this
was
quite
clearly
set
forth
in
the
opinion
of
the
unanimous
state
supreme
court
where
the
statements
by
each
of
the
jurors
on
the
voir
dire
was
summarized,
and
the
court
concluded
that
pursuant
to
penal
code
section
1076
of
california
penal
code
that
these
jurors
were
not
disqualified.
mr.
william
e.
james
this
is
--
i'm
referring
now
to
the
four
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
there's
no
limitation--
mr.
william
e.
james
there's
no
occasion
to
these
jurors
were
not
disqualified.
they
had
not
come
there
with
fixed
opinions.
as
i
pointed
out
first,
petitioner
overstated
herself
here
and
says
the
trial
court
permitted.
the
trial
court
had
no
opportunity
to
do
rule
on
it.
so,
there
as
no
permitting
by
the
trial
court
jurors
were
not
there
with
fixed
opinions.
mr.
william
e.
james
and
it
is
not
--
pardon.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
say
no
and
i
think
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that
they
have
fixed
opinions.
no.
mr.
william
e.
james
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
james
not
in
ventura
county.
mr.
william
e.
james
yes,
but
it
is
our
position,
she
did
not
re
--
retain
a
fixed
opinion
as
to
the
guilt
and
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
interrogation
by
defense
counsel
that
defense
counsel
did
not
believe
that
she
had
any
fixed
opinion
as
to
the
guilt
and
that
she
could
not
qualify
as
a
juror
who've
rendered
a
fair
and
impartial
where
it'd
be
solely
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
not
these
jurors.
mr.
william
e.
james
present
--
mr.
william
e.
james
of
course
--
mr.
william
e.
james
but
she
didn't
say
that
she
couldn't
render
a
fair
and
impartial
verdict
according
to
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
she
said
why
a
defense
counsel
because
he
passed
her
for
cause.
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
william
e.
james
i
don't
see
this
argument
about
being
afraid
to
challenge
a
juror
or
cause
or
peremptorily
or
at
least
challenge
for
cause
because
obviously,
this
could
be
made
against
by
any
defendant
who
by
the
later
time,
i'd
say
that
there
was
on
the
juror
--
jury
an
obnoxious
juror
but
he
was
afraid
to
challenge
because
he
might
--
if
he
--
is
challenge
was
disallowed,
have
the
prejudice
of
that
juror
and
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
possibly,
he
felt
the
juror
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
i
think
it
was
suggested
earlier
when
counsel
for
duncan,
petitioner
duncan
was
arguing
that
it
wouldn't
been
very
easy
to
preserve
in
the
record
this
challenge
if
it'd
actually
be
--
if
it
wasn't
and
after
thought
that
they
had
made
now
as
to
one
that
get
rid
of
these
jurors,
they
could
have
very
well
have
at
the
bench,
outside
of
the
hearing
of
the
prospective
jurors
made
their
record,
obtained
either
at
the
bench
or
in
chambers,
their
objection
to
these
particular
jurors
had
a
ruling.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
--
that's
our
position.
in
other
words,
it's
not
an
idle
act
to
preserve
a
constitutional
right.
and
if
he
was
going
to
challenge
these
jurors,
if
he
felt
that
these
particular
jurors
could
not
render
fair
and
impartial
verdicts
contrary
to
what
he
put
in
the
record
here
that
he
was
satisfied
in
the
minute
that
he
passed
them
for
cause.
if
he
felt
that
they
could
not
render
fair
and
impartial
verdict,
he
had
a
duty
to
present
that
matter
to
the
trial
court
and
get
a
ruling,
and
he
could
have
done
it
--
mr.
william
e.
james
how
could
the
judge
rule?
this
was
merely
on
the
change
of
venue.
how
could
the
judge
rule
on
any
particular
juror?
there
was
no
juror
mentioned?
was
he
was
going
to
throw
out
the
entire
panel?
mr.
william
e.
james
there's
no
mention
of
hall,
there
was
no
mention
of
berstch
or
horrell.
mr.
william
e.
james
change
of
venue.
mr.
william
e.
james
as
i
recall
the
record
the
defense
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
had
exhausted
their
preemptories.
mr.
william
e.
james
they
should
have
four
more
preemptories.
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
right.
but
it's
still
didn't
prevent
this
petitioner,
if
she
was
dissatisfied
with
these
prospective
jurors
or
jurors
about
to
be
sworn
making
a
record
before
they
were
sworn
as
to
her
objection
because
he
said
--
mr.
william
e.
james
pardon?
mr.
william
e.
james
if
he
was
going
to
now
ascribe
to
the
trial
court
the
permitting
of
three
jurors
to
sit,
he
certainly
should
allow
the
trial
court
an
opportunity
to
rule
one
way
or
another
and
feeling
that
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
he
hardly
comes
before
this
court
with
a
constitutional
question.
mr.
william
e.
james
we
specifically
pointed
out
the
dodge
in
this
situation,
the
dodge
juror
there
and
there
i
think
there
was
an
earlier
juror
that
was
interrogated,
the
trial
judge
was
very
liberal
actually
in
allowing
a
challenge
for
cause
when
he
didn't
actually
feel
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
that
a
challenge
for
cause
lay
and
--
mr.
william
e.
james
made
an
effort.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
he
should
have
made
--
mr.
william
e.
james
--
he
should
have
made
his
objection
in
the
trial
court
and
not
here.that's
what
we
say.
mr.
william
e.
james
well
then
he
can't
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
three
jurors
were
permitted
by
the
trial
court
to
remain
on
with
fixed
opinions
because
they
didn't
have
fixed
opinions.
that's
the
sole
issue
of
this
case.
mr.
william
e.
james
well,
of
course
it's
a
fairly
limited
question,
this
question
number
two
in
the
duncan
case.
i
think
your
honors
(voice

--
mr.
william
e.
james
the
--
the
first
one
in
order
of
interrogation
was
mrs.
berstch
and
her
testimony,
her
interrogation
appears
partially
on
636
and
637
of
the
--
i
think
it
extends
further
but
i
have
a
notation
636
and
637
of
the
transcript.
mr.
william
e.
james
i
think
that's
correct.
ms.
hall,
that's
the
hall
that
remained
in
the
--
mr.
william
e.
james
she's
around
648
and
mr.
horrell,
i
have
a
notation,
668
to
6671
--
668
to
671,
and
i
think
it
extended
earlier
with
an
--
mr.
william
e.
james
that's
correct.
mr.
william
e.
james
horrell.h-o-r-r-e-l-l.
thank
you,
your
honors.
