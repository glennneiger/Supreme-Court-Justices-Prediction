justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
hear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes
but
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wirin.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
need
some
indictment.
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
the
interrelation
of
these
three
cases.
these
are
three
cases
against
three
individuals,
each
of
whom
was
tried
separately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
there
any
--
was
there
in
the
cases
subsequent
to
mrs.
duncan's
trial
either
in
moya
or
baldonado,
was
there
any
stipulation
that
evidence
introduced
in
the
earlier
trial
should
be
deemed
as
though
introduced
in
the
succeeding
trials
or
were
these
trials
absolutely
separate?
the
argument
–
the
suggestions
you
last
made
or
the
observations
that
a
--
that
a
conduct
may
continue
over
a
period
of
time
is
irrelevant
to
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
is
whether
three
cases
separately
tried
before
separate
juries
here
on
separate
records
should
be
judged
independent,
each
record
being
an
autonomous
proceeding
and
therefore
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
is
not
clear
to
me
when
you
said
it
has
some
connection.
what
is
the
connection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
separately
introduced
in
each
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
--
or
by
stipulation
agreed
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
carry
over,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
put
in
short
reverses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
--
what
i
want
to
know,
could
i
judge
each
one
of
these
trials
by
merely
looking
at
the
record
of
each
one
of
these
trials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
then
there's
no
connection
between
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
care
about
the
material.
i
want
to
know
whether
each
record
presents
an
autonomous
record
of
the
cases
which
must
be
decided
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
just
a
physical
way
of
dealing
with
the
materials
in
each
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
if
you
--
if
i
may
interrupt
or
intervene,
i
think
we'd
all
save
time
if
you
told
us
what
the
facts
were,
you
see
them
relevant
to
the
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
hope
so.
you
say
you
hope
so.
i
assume
that
means
you
determined
to
do
so
and
that
it's
clear
in
your
own
mind
that
they
are
three
separate
cases.
if
--
instead
of
clearing
your
own
mind,
you
wouldn't
possibly
make
it
clear
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
emphasize
what
the
intention
should
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
where
is
that?
where
is
that
release
of
the
confession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
see
it
with
my
own
eyes.
where
is
it,
mr.
wirin?
fact
is
so
much
powerful
that
speeches
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wait
a
minute.
you
just
said
you
very
well
know
mr.
wirin
and
nobody
is
more
sympathetic
with
scrutinizing
the
conduct
of
prosecutors
than
i
am,
but
i'd
like
to
know
–
have
the
facts
before
i
do
that.
now
you
said
the
district
attorney
released
the
confession
there.
where
in
print
do
i
find
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
bear
with
you.
all
--
all
you
want
me
to
bear
with
you,
i'm
simply
asking
you
to
make
good
on
your
statements.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
it
was
apparently
it's
not
in
this
sheet.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
you
entirely
face
it
like
an
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
right,
am
i
right
in
reading
that
statement
whatever
i
might
think
of
this,
am
i
right
that
in
that
statement,
there's
no
reference
direct
or
most
oblique
to
any
of
these
defendants?
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
could
say
yes
or
no
to
that,
can't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
take
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
has
been
quoted,
he
has
been
--
you
see
that's
my
difficulty.
you
say
the
district
attorney
released
the
confession.
then
when
i
ask
you
where
is
it
you
say,
“well
will
you
bear
with
me,
i'll
tell
you
about
that
later.”
then
you
refer
to
a
statement
in
which
there
is
no
reference
to
any
defendant
and
you
say
it
isn't
true
that
there
is
no
reference
because
that
must
be
read
in
context
with
the
right
hand
column
which
however
you
agree
doesn't
sufficiently
made
clear
that
the
district
attorney
released
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
was
talking
about
the
confession.
is
there
any
reference
in
the
right
hand
column
that
the
district
attorney
whose
name
was
what
was
it
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
he
released
it.
i'm
not
denying
the
fact.
i'm
merely
denying
that
i
don't
find
that
in
this
column.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well,
but
then
you
make
--
then
you
got
to
make
that
statement
carry
more
than
it
is
barely
capable
of
carrying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perhaps,
i
will
accomplish
my
prefaces
best
by
not
asking
you
any
further
question
which
you
will
lay
bear
all
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you
are
but
i
don't
think
you
can
get
much
proper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
are
they?
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
just
give
me
--
can't
you
refer
to
the
page?
i
have
the
greatest
possible
interest
in
this
case,
mr.
wirin.
you
well
know
from
my
prior
writings.
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
be
satisfied
that
you
make
out
your
case
if
you
got
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
now
were
all
these
other
statements
entered
before
the
court
in
each
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
each
case,
they
were
these
statements
on
the
basis
of
which
you
felt
you
did
not
have
your
client
and
you
have
a
fair
trial
within
each
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i,
before
you
move
on,
pursue
chief
justice's
question.
if
you
rely
on
merely
on
those
two
statements
in
the
duncan
record,
then
you
cannot
say
that
there
was
a
persistent
course
of
conduct
by
the
district
attorney.
isn't
that
so?
if
you
only
--
if
you
--
you
just
answered
chief
justice
--
chief
justice
that
these
are
the
only
two
things
in
the
duncan
record.
well,
then
your
statement
that
there
was
a
persistent
course
of
conduct
can't
apply
the
duncan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it's
very
vital
to
that
case,
isn't
it?
to
me
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
whether
district
attorney
talks
all
the
time
over
that
the
judge
what
he
did
once
or
twice.
one
who
betrays
the
state
of
mind
and
the
other
may
betray
a
lapse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
same
year
you
mean.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
prison
system
for
either
of
the
state
or
the
--
of
this
county?
this
tape
recording
that
the
person
that
gave
or
allowed
to
be
made
was
done
while
he
was
in
prison,
i
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
he
would
have
to
get
--
he
would
have
to
be
authorized
to
do
this
to
receive
reporters
have
a
reception
and
have
the
tv
people
in
and
all
that,
that
would
require
the
consent
of
the
prison
authority,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
county
jail?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
it's
a
matter
of
just
--
you
know
we
deal
about
civil
liberties
as
a
matter
of
civil
liberty.
suppose
all
of
that
were
denied
to
a
person
confined
in
the
county
jail,
could
he
claim
any
right
either
under
the
california
law
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
anything
to
be
allowed
to
receive
reporters
and
talk
to
them,
make
a
good
case
for
himself
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
propriety
of
that
is
not
an
issue
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
arranged
meaning
the
authorities
had
to
give
him
permission
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
he
--
could
he
have
been
blocked
in
doing
that?
the
original
recording
was
it
that,
that
you
now
tell
us,
was
at
the
behest
of
the
state,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
counsel
knew
that
there
was
going
to
be
such
recording?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
not
brought
an
issue
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
more
i
listen
to
this
case,
the
stranger
it
gets.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
--
your
point
would
have
some
validity
with
me
if
you
could
turn
to
other
portions
of
the
record
in
which
the
judge
made
a
similar
disclosure
or
even
a
disclosure
of
an
ambiguity
of
his
mind
as
to
what
is
required
of
jurors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
care
about
hypothesis
because
i
--
really,
i
have
to
act
on
what's
in
this
record
and
such
reasoning
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
legitimately
flows
there
from.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
are
there
any
things
in
which
legitimately
there
flows
the
judge
allowed
jurors
to
remain
or
may
defendant
needlessly
to
exercise
his
preemptory
challenges
in
keeping
people
off.
it's
the
judge
who
should
have
thrown
off.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
warner
may
i
ask
you
this?
when
the
voir
dire
examination
was
completed,
there
were
objections
to
the
retention
of
these
prospective
jurors
as
jurors,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
refer
me
to
the
record
in
which
the
basis
of
the
objection
is
stated
or
was
it
merely
of
an
unexplained
objection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
talking
about
four
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
--
are
you
--
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood,
it's
all
my
fault.
are
you
getting
these
instances
as
--
as
validation
of
your
statement
to
me
that
you're
going
to
show
me
other
instances
disclosing
the
state
of
mind
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
do
that,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
first
one
that
you
read,
where
he
excused
the
court
somebody
who
said
that
the
defendant
would
have
to,
in
effect,
at
least
(inaudible)
prove
his
innocence,
none
of
these
four
illustrate
that
point,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
maybe
right,
if
he
made
no
comment
on
that,
each
these
four
up
to
the
other
the
first
one
seems
so
bad
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
finding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
brings
me
to,
for
me,
the
crucial
question
in
the
case,
was
the
conduct
of
the
trial
judge
in
not
excusing
for
cause,
jurors
as
to
whom
the
preemptory
challenges
had
to
be
utilized
such
that
he
was
--
he
had
exhausted
or
she
had
exhausted
the
preemptory
or
preemptory
of
preemptive
challenges
and
therefore
which
prejudiced
in
that
way
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
if
i
go
to
the
record
which
is
--
which
i
have
not
done,
if
i
go
to
the
record
as
i
shall,
will
i
find
that
the
defendants
lawyer
then
said,
“we
have
no
more
preemptive
challenges
but
i
would
like
to
have
them,
if
i
had
them
to
get
rid
of
a,
b,
and
c,
but
i
can't
because
your
honor
misruled
in
this
rule
in
not
allowing
us
and
compelling
us
to
use
preemptive
challenges
when
you
should
have
been
discharged
them
for
cause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
–
do
i
find
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
as
my
word,
i
can
have
it
in
the
lawyer's
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
--
you
have
to
show
that
according
to
california
law,
he
was
allowed
--
she
was
allowed
how
many
preemptors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
20,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
you
say
she's
allowed
20
but
she
wasn't
allowed
to
exercise
them
at
the
risk
of
having
on
the
jury
patently
biased
jurors.
you've
got
to
establish
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
opening
--
the
opening
statement
of
the
supreme
court,
your
supreme
court's
opinion
on
page
143
of
the
duncan
record,
defendant
places
particular
emphasis
on
newspaper
report
of
statements
made
by
the
district
attorney
to
investigate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
made
by
the
district
attorney.
justice
felix
frankfurter
doesn't
that
mean
that
the
relation
of
the
district
attorney
to
those
statements
is
in
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
newspaper
reports
made
by
the
district
attorney,
not
newspaper
reports.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
supreme
court
--
does
your
supreme
court
--
i
haven't
read
this
opinion
since
we
granted
certiorari
before
you
granted
the
petition,
it
was
nearly
a
year
ago.
does
your
supreme
court
completely
--
does
your
supreme
court
find
on
the
record
that
the
statements
which
are
attributed
by
the
press
or
part
thereof
to
district
attorney
were
in
fact
not
made
by
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
call
the
reach
of
your
suggestion
that
this
issue
was
not
in
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
for
the
(inaudible)
of
the
district
attorney
to
that
publicity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
implying
it
if
he
wants
to
be
solidity
of
his
response
to
the
(inaudible),
but
his
relation
to
the
publicity
certainly
was
considered
by
your
supreme
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
couldn't
it
be
more
helpful
at
least
to
one
member
of
the
court
and
by
doing
just
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
there
been
an
indictment
filed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
may
i
--
you
would
or
is
it
out
of
place
in
your
orderly
scheme
of
things,
you
would
help
me
at
least
if
you
could
refer
to
precisely
the
newspaper
exhibit
on
the
basis
on
which
duncan
for
the
first
time
claimed
newspaper
inflammatory
articles
as
the
basis
for
seeking
of
change
of
venue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
this
--
this
is
valid
he's
been
affected
from
page
138
in
substance
he
said
the
same
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
this
–
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
year
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
have
been
after
this
--
this
newspaper
published.
it
must
have
been
after
somebody
disclosed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
have
been
after
early
november.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
there
with
mrs.
duncan's
lawyer
in
these
annulment
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
was
he
--
he
the
counsel
of
elizabeth
duncan,
he
must
have
been?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
the
original
exhibits
filed
with
our
clerk,
mr.
james?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
purported
to
go
through
all
the
exhibits
before
the
trial
court
under
the
motion
to
change
the
venue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
i'm
asking
whether
you
have
and
thus
far,
are
you
planning
to
do
that
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
you
haven't
finish
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
later
exhibits
bring
in
the
other
matter,
don't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
she
remain
detained
after
december
12th
on
the
fake
annulment
charge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
a
bailable
offense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
no
--
did
she
make
no
effort
to
bail?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
was
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
so
thank
you.
$50,000

you
said

she

was
fixed

charge.
that
charge
preceded
the
charge
in

barbara
county
for
conspiracy
for
murder.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
the
reduction
from
$50,000
to
$5000?
because
after
december,
what
was
it,
16,
she
was
under
a
murder
charge,
a
conspiracy
with
murder?
justice

well,
there

that

that
wouldn't
be
bailable,
would
it
or
wouldn't
it?
justice

not.
after
all,
i'm

what's
the
relation
of
the
$5000
reduced
fail
to
that

must
have
preceded

suppose.

none
of
these

that
you
summarized

all
the

were
not
annexed
to

they?
justice

after
he's
under

after
she
was
under
indictment
for
a

justice

you're
going
to
go
on

state
when
it
come
to

with

exactly
what
was
the
basis
of

her

all
the

connection
with

after

justice
felix
frankfurter
but
of
course
mr.
james,
if
in
fact,
if
in
fact
the
district
attorney
makes
a
statement
regarding
a
pending
case
which
fairly
considered
may
poison
the
minds
of
prospective
jurors.
the
fact
that
at
the
time,
california
was
seriously
considering
measures
dealing
with
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
make
a
difference,
would
it?
justice

as
i

follow
you
that
--
justice

well,
i
don't
think
any
sinister
purpose
you
just
saw
in
this

reinforcing
arguing
for
reviews.
justice

yes.

meaning

does
anybody
wants
to
get

did

you

to
his
question,
that
in
fact
the
confession
was
emitted
by
the

you
put
it?
justice

so
that
it
wasn't
the
publication
of
the

didn't
derive
from

going

nothing

nothing
has
said
about

justice

it's

wasn't
it?
justice

alright.
justice

when
you

made

it
doesn't

that
it's

justice

--
justice

well,
this

this
was
front
page
news
for
about
a
month,
was
it?
justice

a
mystery.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
after
--
after
the
confession
in
the
finding
of
the
body,
was
it
front
page
news
for
days
thereafter?
justice
felix
frankfurter
thus
not
merely
the
two
articles,
but
this
circulation
of
the
confession
because
it's
--
if
merely
the
fact
that
grand

minute
a
public

right
pleading,
the
district

wasn't
contend
to
rely
on
that.
he
himself
was
an
active
agent
in
putting
it
in
circulation.
he
didn't
rely
on
the
things
being
a
public
document.
justice

but
the
fact
is
supposed
to
be
elicited
in
the
courtroom
and
not
in
newspaper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
hearing,
he'd
never
tried.
just
give
--
give
the
press
the
facts.
justice
felix

there
are
many
claims
can
be
made
for
california
but
not
that
human
nature
there
is
different
from
other
places
--
justice

--
of
power
to
control
that
gets
into
the
mind
can
be
controlled
in
california
when
it
can't
be
controlled
in
new
york
or
in
massachusetts.
justice
felix

but
you've
--
but
you've
said
several
times
with
your
characteristic
conduct,
if
i
may
say
so,
that
even
rely
on
the
publicity
on
the
public
record
quality
of
the
confession,
he
sought
to
it
that
the
newspapers
got
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
a
denial
--
is
there
a
denial
by
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
omitted
this
confession?
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
there
a
denial
by
the
district
attorney
that
it
isn't
true
that
he
put
out
or
put
into
the
hands
of
the
press
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
specifically,
did
he
deny
that
--
did
he
say
--
why,
of
course,
they
got
it
by
going
to
the
record
office,
whatever
you
call
it,
i
didn't
get
the
confession
out.
did
he
make
any
such
denial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
say
i'm
innocent.
i
can
put
everything
out
of
my
mind
that
ever
got
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
some
that
could
and
some
that
couldn't,
most
of
us
can't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
wasn't
--
was
the
charge
made
that
he
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
by
the
defense.
if
they
say,
it
was
the
district
attorney
who
let
go
and
put
into
the
hands
of
--
of
media.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
the
authorities
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
who
would
be
the
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
are
they
free
willing?
can
they
go
on
their
own?
or
is
the
case,
when
a
murder
case
get
into
this
situation,
isn't
the
district
attorney
the
controlling
authority?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
not
asking
necessarily.
i'm
talking
in
the
normal
course
of
business,
wasn't
the
district
attorney,
isn't
he
the
chief
law
officer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
he
or
does
he
not
control
police
officials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
not
children.
i
know
he
doesn't
necessarily.
i'm
asking
you
what
is
the
normal
course
of
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
anyhow,
they're
part
of
the
prosecutorial
obstacle
of
the
state,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
--
was
--
did
the
defense
make
any
specific
charge
that
the
authority
disseminated
these
confessions
in
their
motion
for
change
of
venue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
that
isn't
an
issue
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
of
them
said
that
the
authorities
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
they
--
that
same
issue
said
that
the
authorities
disseminated
--
the
the
confession,
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
did
the
district
attorney
make
any
reply
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
say
anything
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
didn't
say,
"i'm
not
one
of
the
authorities"
so
that's
a
false
statement
in
the
press.
you
said
a
little
while
ago,
the
newspapers
published
nothing
but
the
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
revolves
a
statement
of
fact
that
the
authorities
gave
these.
was
that
denial
on
behalf
of
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
don't
care
whether
the
sheriff
or
the
district
attorney
who
puts
him
to
the
stream
of
publicity,
things
that
ought
to
be
kept
out
of
the
stream
of
publicity
by
the
enforcing
officials.
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
was
put
in
issue,
it
was
put
an
issue
by
the
finding
of
an
affidavit
which
made
part
of
its
allegations,
this
paper
and
this
paper
made
two
allegations
that
the
district
attorney
issued
the
statement
on
capital
punishment.
it
also
made
a
statement
that
the
authority
disseminated
the
confession.
i
suggest
that
when
a
district
attorney
makes
a
comment
on
one
part
of
a
statement
in
an
affidavit
of
change
of
venue,
which
says
nothing
about
the
other
presumably,
he
doesn't
deny
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
is
a
very
different
thing
from
having
--
asking
a
district
attorney
to
deny
everything
that's
put
in
the
newspapers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
was
an
affidavit
of
which
the
--
this
newspaper
was
the
basis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
your
argument
but
to
one
like
myself
to
whom
it
is
not
irrelevant
whether
he
did
or
didn't.
you
say
the
only
issue
is
true
or
false,
did
that
so
corrupt
the
minds
of
the
jurors
that
they
couldn't
rid
themselves
of
this.
i
think
that
is
not
the
only
issue
because
i
think
that
kind
of
a
psychological
answer
presupposes
things
that
are
contrary
to
human
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
say
to
you
what
i
said
before.
if
the
district
attorney
handed
out
these
confessions,
it
means
he
wasn't
contempt
to
have
people
go
to
the
record
office
that
he
actively
saw
to
it
that
they
got
it
and
didn't
rely
on
the
mere
--
the
availabilities,
the
matter
of
official
doctrines.
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
one
more
mr.
james.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
please
explain
the
allegation
in
mr.
sullivan's
affidavit
about
the
statement
printed
on
page
7
in
--
his
crime
is
one
of
the
most
vicious
and
powerful,
then
the
editor,
there's
no
such
statement
ever
appeared
to
this
statement.
page
7,
this
crime
is
one
of
the
most
vicious
and
horrible
and
(inaudible).
and
then
the
next
day,
the
editor,
mr.
jackson
henry,
the
managing
editor
of
ventura
county
star
examined
the
issues,
did
not
make
any
such
statement,
had
no
knowledge
or
information
to
believe
that
he
made
any
of
the
statement
to
anyone.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
--
is
that
cleared
how
--
how
mr.
sullivan
or
an
oath
to
say
this
appeared
in
the
december
27,
1958
or
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
a
piece
of
flagrant
carelessness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
why
he
said
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
that.
he
said
he
didn't
make
publicly
the
following
statement.
the
proof
of
calculated
revolving
killing
for
hire
of
olga
duncan
is
one
of
--
is
a
number
of
horrible
crimes
recently
have
been
committed
in
california.
and
then
he
says
neither
of
the
following
statement
or
anything
resembling
it
was
ever
made
by
me
at
anytime.
this
crime
is
one
of
the
most
vicious
and
horrible
in
the
annals
of
modern
justice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
sense
of
nicety
of
english,
it
is
very
nice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
statement
which
he
avows
on
the
21st,
he
did
say
the
proof
of
calculator
result
in
killing
for
olga
--
olga
duncan.
so,
this
wasn't
just
generally
in
capital
punishment
source.
this
is
using
olga
duncan
vicious
horrible
crime
as
an
argument
to
capital
source.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
james,
these
--
these
three
jurors
which
we're
talking
about,
it
kept
down
for
they
--
for
they
kept
on
after
the
defense
that
exhausted
preemptory
challenges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well.
suppose
they
had
to
exhaust
their
preemptories
when
they
should
have
been
--
when
they
could
have
kept
them
in
that
juror
should
be
drawn
off
the
course.
and
therefore,
they
had
no
preemptories
left.
and
suppose
all
that
was
wrong,
suppose
people
should
have
been
drawn
off
the
course
but
weren't
and
therefore,
they
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
they
should
have
had
four
more
preemptories.
many
of
counsel
can
exercise
preemptory
although
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
throw
them
off
for
cause
and
that
right
to
not
to
take
risks
is
also
a
very
important
right
at
trial,
that's
why
people
have
preemptories.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean,
suppose
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
make
a
record
as
them
again
--
as
because
you
might
be
right
about
that.
you
think
he
should
have
then
said,
"your
honor,
if
i
had
three
more
preemptories,
i
would
exercise
them
against
a,
b,
and
c."
is
that
--
the
back
of
that
is
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
--
suppose
the
counsel
or
conscientiously
--
conscientiously
believe
there
isn't
ground
of
objecting
this
amount
of
cause.
should
he
then
make
a
speech
to
the
trial
judge
and
say,
"your
honor,
this
is
the
situation
i
am
in.
there
isn't
ground
for
us
your
honor
to
discharge
these
jurors.
but
if
i
had
reference,
i
would
not
have
that."
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
should
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
should
have
made
an
appeal
misericordia.he
should
have
asked
the
compassionate
and
said,
"your
honor,
i'm
not
agrestic
but
would
you
please"
nevertheless
i'm
troubled
about
these
two
jurors
and
not
to
seek
them.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
to
make
it
sound
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
he
had
no
objection
except
the
trial
under
which
had
gone
against
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
sufficiently
fix
--
sufficiently
fix
for
his
purposes
so
that
he
wouldn't
have
had
them
if
he
could
keep
them
all.
but
it's
not
sufficiently
vague
as
a
matter
of
cause,
he
should
have
been
--
not
allowed
to
sit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
date
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
that
an
exhibit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
exhibit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
publish,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
publish
means
available
to
the
public.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
have
time
with
chief
justice's
permission?
were
these
press
accounts
attached
as
part
of
your
affidavit
asking
for
a
change
of
venue?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
district
attorney
make
any
reply
to
that
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
nothing
about
these
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
were
part
of
the
--
they
were
a
foundation
of
your
motion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
specifically
claimed
that
the
--
the
marshaling
of
these
various
successive
statements
attributing
statements
to
him.
well
but
in
your
view,
affected
the
opinion
of
the
feelings
or
the
thoughts
of
the
capacities
of
prospective
jurors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
made
no
reply
to
these
affidavits
attributing
to
him
the
statements
you
quoted.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
understand
that
other
than
that.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
applied
only
to
moya,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
you're
in
a
difficult
position
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
in
your
--
in
your
motion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
this
is
very
important
to
me.
but
to
this
earlier
motion
in
january,
in
which
--
to
which
you
are
next
i
take
it
all
these
newspapers
or
reporters'
data
or
reproductions
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
making
these
explicit
attributions
either
to
the
district
attorney
or
members
of
his
own
staff,
not
somebody
else's
staff.
there
was
no
denial
except
as
to
the
one
statement.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
you
don't
disavow
the
responsibility
of
the
district
attorney
in
the
setting
of
the
fact
that
it's
well-known
the
district
attorneys
do
talk
to
the
press
that
there
were
charges
in
the
newspapers
that
you
filed
saying
that
the
district
attorney
did
this
and
he
didn't
answer
that.is
that
correct?
