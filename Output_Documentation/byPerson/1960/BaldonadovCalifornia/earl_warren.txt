mr.
wirin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
duncan
case,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
wirin?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
your
position
that
the
--
what
happened
in
the
duncan
trial
as
to
the
jurors
has
any
bearing
at
all
on
the
other
two
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
i
--
i'm
just
a
little
confused
now
because
you
said
there
was
some
kind
of
a
stipulation
concerning
these
things
carrying
over
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
stipulation
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that's
not
a
stipulation.
if
there
is
a
stipulation
in
the
record,
i
will
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
was
just
talking
to
your
--
your
stipulation
as
you
said.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
stipulation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
one
other
--
one
other
thing.
you
said
that
she
was
sentenced
on
the
--
on
the
8th
of
april,
did
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
3rd
of
april
and
the
trial
of
--
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
thereafter
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
when
was
her
--
when
was
her
second
trial
completed?
was
it
--
was
it
completed
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
was
completed
before
either
trial,
before
the
trial
of
baldonado?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
you
contend
that
what
he
said
after
the
second
verdict
was
in
on
mrs.
duncan
that
that
affected
her
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
on
the
rulings
of
the
trial
court,
wasn't
that
determined
in
the
supreme
court
of
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
wirin
also
i
--
i
--
in
these
cases
while
they're
consolidated
are
listed
as
baldonado
and
moya
and
duncan.
now
i
hope
you
are
going
to
discuss
them
separately
and
not
--
and
not
bring
them
all
together
so
that
we
have
to
decide
all
the
issues
as
to
one
case
because
there
are
some
very
different
situations
in
these
three
cases.
are
you
going
to
do
that
for
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
who
you
want
to
start
with,
baldonado?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
in
your
brief
and
duncan
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
baldonado!
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
that's
all
--
that's
all
that
you
have
in
mind
so
far
as
this
particular
exhibit
is
concerned,
what
have
told?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
--
on
the
same
page
is
a
picture
of
the
shallow
grave
in
which
they
found
the
murdered
young
woman,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
object
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
you
rely,
in
the
duncan
case
you
rely
on
these
two
statements
and
these
alone.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
said
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
wouldn't
the
--
wouldn't
the
record
at
the
trial
itself
convey
that
same
impression
just
as
strongly
if
the
district
attorney
in
the
trial
of
the
duncan
case
urged
the
jury
to
render
the
--
to
inflict
the
death
penalty
and
the
jury
did,
it
would
be
a
natural
assumption
whether
he
said
it
or
not
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
verdict,
wouldn't
they?
and
what
--
what
difference
would
that
make
to
the
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
wirin,
i
notice
in
the
appendix
a
to
the
respondent's
brief
in
the
moya
--
moya
case,
where
we
have
so
many
items
of
news,
the
government
lists,
according
to
the
record,
69
statements
that
counsel
for
the
defense
gave
to
the
press
concerning
the
evidence
and
other
matters
in
the
--
in
the
case.
do
you
think
that
bears
upon
the
situation
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
this
one
in
there
where
counsel
says
that
the
prosecution
was
solely
for
the
purpose
of
politics
and
that
the
district
attorney
intended
to
climb
to
higher
office
over
the
dead
body
of
the
defendant
duncan.
you
think
that
is
provocative?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
there's
one
other
thing
that
struck
me
in
--
in
here.
as
i
understand
from
the
briefs,
the
defendant
baldonado
--
baldonado
through
discovery
proceedings
acquired
the
tape
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
prosecutor
had
taken
on
his
confession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
he,
the
defendant,
gave
that
tape
to
the
broadcasting
companies
to
be
broadcasted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
he
himself
went
on
the
air
in
order
to
reassert
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
recording
to
reassert
his
--
his
confession
of
guilt
and
how
he
had
beaten
--
beaten
and
strangled
this
unfortunate
young
woman
there.
do
you
think
that
the
statement
of
the
district
attorney
compares
in
any
respect
with
--
with
that
so
far
as
influence
on
the
public
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
wirin,
i
notice
also
in
your
brief
you
complain
because
there
was
photography
permitted
in
the
courtroom.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
as
i
read
the
brief
of
the
state,
that
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
defendant
and
over
the
objection
of
the
district
attorney.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
read
the
brief
of
the
government
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
district
attorney
objected
to
it
and
that
the
--
and
that
the
defense
requested
it.
now
is
that
--
did
the
defense
request
this
photography
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
objections
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
warner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
represent
which
one?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
see
your
name
on
her
--
on
her
brief.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
looking
at
the
brief,
the
brief
that
was
filed
march
18,
1961.
i
see
mr.
wirin,
mr.
dutch,
mr.
(inaudible),
and
mr.
rosa.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
baldonado.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
excuse
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
an
act
of
harshness
or
an
act
--
act
of
liberality
towards
the
defendant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
did.
he
did
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
excuse
her
for
a
cause.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
those
questions
--
were
those
questions
objected
to
as
misconduct?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
--
why
if
they
were
so
designed,
would
they
not
be
objected
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
you
were
talking
about
the
type
of
questions
and
the
inference
that
would
flow
from
them
and
the
unfair
position
that
put
the
juror
--
prospective
juror
and
then
making
his
answer.
now
if
that
is
true,
why
wouldn't
they
be
objected
to
on
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
not
they
the
attorneys
for
the
other
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
that's
your
answer,
it's
different.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
are
you
referring
to
the
four
who
were
--
who
were
taken
off?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
used
the
peremptory
on
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
may
i
ask
you
this,
mr.
warner?
did
you
raise
that
before
the
supreme
court
of
california?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
supreme
court
hold?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that's
a
finding,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
to
go
further
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
not
merely
that
for
all
i
know
accepting
your
statement
of
it
that
the
supreme
court
of
california
disregarded
its
own
precedents
or
reference
to
the
rehabilitation
of
prospective
jurors.
here
you
have
to
go
further
and
you
have
to
make
out
a
case
that
the
defendant
had
to
exercise
territory
challenges
needlessly
in
the
acceptance
in
the
case
of
jurors
who
patently
were
disqualified,
incapable
of
giving
a
fair
trial
so
that
if
they
could
be
--
if
the
defendant
had
allowed
those
jurors
to
sit,
he
would
have
had
loaded
dice
in
the
jury
box
because
the
fact
that
this
was
outside
or
in
defiance
of,
if
you
please,
of
local
state
court
rule
which
about,
which
i
know
nothing
is
enough
to
make
it
violative
of
due
process,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
warner.
when
--
when
was
this
issue
first
raised?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
one
you're
talking
about
--
about
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
raised
it
in
your
opening
brief
in
the
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
partially
did
you
raise
it
in
the
--
in
the
opening
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
alright
now
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
warner?
did
you
raise
--
did
you
raise
that
issue
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
this
very
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
reading
the
briefs
i
understood
you
did
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
i
don't
want
to
argue
with
you
because
you
know
the
record
and
i
don't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
want
to
know
--
you
want
to
know
whether
you
raised
it
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court
or
not
on
your
motion
for
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
let
--
now
let
me
ask
you
this
as
to
anyone
of
the
12
jurors
who
sat
in
her
case,
did
you
object
during
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
not
object
to
the
sitting
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean
just
what
i
say.
i
mean
did
you
object
--
did
you
object
to
the
sitting
of
any
single
juror
who
sat
in
the
case
of
mrs.
duncan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
mean
by
overt
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
let's
--
let's
find
that
in
the
record.
so
we
just
find
which
you
did
raise.
i'm
--
i
think
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
673,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute,
673?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
672.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
passed
for
cause.
the
court
-
alright
the
preemptory
is
with
the
people,
mr.
gustafson,
i
accept
that
your
honor.
mr.
solomon,
your
honor,
before
the
jurist
one
may
counsel
for
its
events.
yes
and
the
following
proceedings
were
held.
now
tell
me
in
there
what
--
what
was
said
to
--
to
challenge
any
single
juror
who
sat
in
that
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
you
merely
state
that
in
such
general
terms,
but
the
court,
after
you
had
stated
that
in
those
very
general
terms
and
not
attacking
any
particular
juror
said
this.
do
you
want
to
argue
the
motion
for
a
change
of
venue?
mr.
sullivan,
that's
counsel
for
the
defendant,
i
take
it,
i'm
--
i
am
just
arguing
it
here
now.
the
court
-
do
you
want
to
argue
it
further
in
the
absence
of
the
jury?
mr.
sullivan
-
no.
i'm
going
to
submit
it
to
your
honor.
i
don't
want
to
go
into
any
extensive
argument.
you've
heard
the
voir
dire
examination
of
all
these
jurors.
the
only
thing
i
could
say
your
honor
is
that
i
haven't
read
yesterday's
transcript
to
the
voir
dire
examination.
perhaps
if
i
have
some
time
to
go
through
it,
i
might
pick
out
some
additional
things
but
i
think
that
perhaps
your
honor
recalls
the
tender
of
the
absence
that
we
receive,
then
both
of
you
say
well
it's
--
it's
submitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
were
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
when
you
were
arguing
this
matter.
why
couldn't
you
say
to
the
--
why
couldn't
you
say
to
the
court
then?
now
your
honor,
we
have
been
deprived
to
four
preemptory
challenges
and
we
think
that
that's
unfair.
we
think
it's
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
we
think
we're
entitled
four
more
preemptory
challenges.
why
couldn't
you
say
that
to
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
said
you
didn't
want
to
say
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
i
wish
you
could
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
on
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
did
you,
where
did
you
raise
it
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it's
alright.
you
go
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
it
--
what
is
this
motion
that
you
make
here?
what
is
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
wouldn't
it
apply
just
as
much
for
instance
to
your
--
your
item
eight
where
you
say
the
--
the
court
erred
in
refusing
each
and
every
instruction
offered
by
the
defendant
and
refused
by
the
court.
do
you
intend
to
apply
to
that
also
that
he
misdirected
the
jury
on
matters
of
law?
does
your
--
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
we
know
--
how
do
we
know
what
you
--
what
you
intended
to
make
federal
question
and
how
would
the
court
know
what
you
intended
to
make
a
federal
question
of
if
you
weren't
more
specific
than
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
mr.
henson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
you
may.
you
may
use
it
in
that
--
in
that
manner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
continue
mr.
james.
chief
justice
earl
warren
with
relation
to
this
her
indictment
in
this
case,
when
was
she
tried
and
convicted
of
that
--
of
that
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
date
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
james
during
the
luncheon
recess
would
you
and
counsel
agree
on
the
date
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
this
fraud
events.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
let
us
know
at
that
time.
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
plead
guilty
too?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
going
--
i
was
going
at
this
point
as
this.
in
california,
whether
--
whether
the
state
proceeding
by
indictment
or
by
preliminary
examination,
the
--
the
testimony
has
made
a
matter
of
public
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
done
at
whose
instance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
counsel,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
after
--
was
it
after
the
grand
jury
testimony
was
made
public?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
would
have
to
because
your
grand
jury
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
testimony
would
be
there
by
the
13,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
the
arraignment
date
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
would
have
to
be
filed
for
13th
of
january.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
date
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
james,
may
i
--
may
i
just
interrupt
to
ask
you
if
--
if
it
is
claimed
that
there
was
any
slanting
of
the
--
of
the
news
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
prejudicing
any
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case
or
was
there
any
editorial
matter
in
the
newspapers
that
is
complained
of
by
these
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
are
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
been
referred
to
in
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
shouldn't
be
bothered
about
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
james
at
the
time
that
this
affidavit
was
presented
to
the
court
for
--
on
a
motion
for
change
in
venue,
the
transcript
of
the
grand
jury
with
the
complete
testimony
of
these
two
men
confessing
to
this
crime
was
a
matter
of
public
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
a
matter
of
public
record
that
everybody
conceive.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
--
i
think
that's
explained
isn't
it
by
the
district
attorney's
affidavit
which
appears
on
page
9
and
at
the
bottom
he
says,
"i
publicly
made
the
following
statement,
the
brutal
calculated
revoking
killing
for
hire
with
all
the
duncan"
is
one
of
the
number
of
horrible
crimes
which
have
recently
been
committed
in
california's
time
after
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
isn't
much
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
pretty
close
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
henson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
mr.
henson
did
you
specifically
charged
the
district
attorney
with
having
--
having
done
anything
in
your
--
in
your
motion
or
in
your
affidavit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
16
of
moya's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
16.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
i
want
--
i
just
want
where
you
--
what
you
specifically
charge
the
district
attorney
with.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
--
you
don't
--
with
that
paragraph,
you
don't
necessarily
charge
him,
do
you?
if
you
say
there
are
some
high
officials
but
do
you
charge
him
specifically
with
doing
anything?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
admitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
admitted.
now,
what
else
do
you
charge
him
with
that
he
didn't
admit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
isn't
there
a
difference
in
the
--
in
which
you're
expecting
to
respond
to
depending
upon
whether
you
charge
him
with
something
in
an
affidavit
or
whether
--
or
whether
you
just
file
a
group
of
newspapers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
file
the
affidavit?
i
--
i
take
it
that
--
that
he
would
be
--
he
should
respond
to
it,
so
it
would
make
an
issue
on
your
motion
for
change
of
venue.
but
if
you
--
if
you
just
put
in
a
lot
of
newspapers,
would
--
would
he
have
to
deny
everything
that's
in
the
newspapers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
denied
that,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
henson,
on
the
10th
day
of
january,
when
that
affidavit
was
--
was
made,
every
fact
that
you
complained
of
in
there
that
has
not
been
denied
by
the
district
attorney,
was
made
known
to
you
and
to
the
public
and
to
the
press
of
course,
through
the
--
the
regular
records
in
this
case,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now
what
things
that
--
what
things
do
you
charge
him
with
that
--
that
were
not
--
that
did
not
stem
from
the
--
in
your
affidavit?
what
--
what
things
do
you
change
him
with
that
were
not
in
the
testimony
of
the
grand
jury
before
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
do
you
charge
him
specifically
with
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
how
did
you
know
he
gave
--
he
gave
it
out?
that's
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
newspapers
get
from
police
records
and
what
a
--
what
a
man's
prior
record
was
and
if
you're
charging
the
district
attorney,
i
would
think
you
would
--
i
--
i
would
think
you
would
have
charged
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
--
if
that's
the
purpose
of
it,
is
one
thing,
but
if
you
seek
to
--
to
pass
all
of
these
things
on
--
on
the
district
attorney,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
charge
him
specifically
with
him
with
those
things
before
you
can
say
he
has
failed
to
deny
them.
that's
all
i'm
--
i'm
concerned
about
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
--
if
you
just
want
to
take
to
thing
in
its
totality,
and
say
these
things
whether
they
came
from
the
district
attorney,
whether
they
came
from
a
sheriff
or
a
police
officer,
or
anybody
else,
has
applied
to
this
--
has
applied
to
this
petitioner
deprives
him
of
a
--
of
a
fair
trial.
i
can
unders
--
i
can
understand
that,
but
this
thing
is
sort
of
congealed
around
the
district
attorney
and
if
--
if
he
is
to
be
charged
with
these
things,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
should
--
and
--
and
in
addition
of
being
charged,
if
he's
to
be
charged
with
not
answering
when
he
should
have,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
be
able
to
find
those
things
in
the
affidavits
supporting
you
--
your
motion
for
change
of
venue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
henson,
are
--
are
any
of
the
counsel
who
were
--
who
were
now
representing
any
of
these
petitioners
appointed
by
any
of
the
courts
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
mr.
henson
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
should
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
for
representing
this
--
this
defendant.
we
are
always
comforted
when
lawyers
are
willing
to
give
their
time
in
--
for
public
cause
of
that
kind
before
entitled
to
representation.
and
--
and
we
always
feel
good
about
it
when
somebody
is
willing
to
do
it.
so,
i
address
my
appreciation
to
you
for
having
performed
that
public
service
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
consider.
and
mr.
attorney
general,
of
course,
we
--
we
appreciate
the
--
the
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
interest
of
your
state.
