et

appellants,
versus
search
warrant
of
property

east
tenth
street,
kansas
city,
missouri,
et

mr.
glazer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
was
your
brief
filed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
we'll
recess
now.
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
read
some
place
in
--
in
one
of
the
briefs.
i
guess
we'll
see
respondents
that
--
that
was
conceded
these
things
were
obscene
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
howard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
there
be
any
constitutional
difference
between
this
kind
of
a
periodical
and
a
daily
newspaper?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
are
some
people
who
believe
the
comics
in
a
newspaper
column
are
not
obscene
have
equally
--
are
there
objections
to
them
on
the
same
if
we're
going
to
have
a
censorship
than
we
have
at
--
over
the
newspapers
in
the
same
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
i
understand
it,
they
--
in
this
case,
they
took
280
different
kinds
of
periodicals.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
11,000
volume
or
issues.
all
the
issues
presumably
that
they
have
to
those
280.
and
of
those
280,
the
court
found
that
180
of
them
were
not
obscene.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
he
was
exercising
a
rather
wide
discretion,
wasn't
he,
when
he
--
when
he
started
to
select
what
was
obscene
and
what
was
not
obscene
without
any
direction
from
the
--
from
the
court
in
the
search
warrant?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
glazer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
will
leave
your
briefs
about
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
