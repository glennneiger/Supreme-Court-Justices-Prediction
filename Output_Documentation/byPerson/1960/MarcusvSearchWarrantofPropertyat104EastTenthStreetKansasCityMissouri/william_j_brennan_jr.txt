but
what
--
what
--
isn't
--
isn't
the
answer
to
this
to
the
question
that
was
decided
at
127
the
third
and
per
curiam
opinion
and
the
language
and
the
question
as
you
raised
it
is
the
actual
assignment
of
error?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
not
the
answer
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
answer,
isn't
it,
to
justice
whittaker's
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
but
they
recite
your
actual
assignment
of
error
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
which
--
in
which
you
assigned
it,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
this
the
one
you've
been
answering
to
mr.
justice
whittaker,
is
the
assignment
of
error
which
raise
these
questions
and
the
one
that
he
asked
you
whether
you'd
raise
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
--
your
opinion
included
in
the
footnote
in
roth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
question
(inaudible)
to
us
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
whether
or
not
these
materials
are
obscene
within
the
roth
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
it
you'd
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
a
quote
right
from
roth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
anyway,
you
said
to
us
that
under
your
practice,
there
was,
in
fact,
an
independent
application
of
the
test
by
the
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
the
trial
court
erred,
we
may
ignore
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
many
of
these
things
seems
to
have
periodically
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it,
there
were
no
longer
current
issue
by
the
time
the
case
was
decided.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
howard,
do
i
correctly
read
this
statute
as
reaching
advertisements
of
books
and
pamphlets
and
so
forth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
advertisements
or
notices
of
any
kind
in
an
information
directly
or
indirectly
when,
where,
how
or
of
whom
any
of
such
things
can
be
obtained.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
suppose
this
huge
distribution
company
might
prevent
the
effect
in
advertisement
in
your
local
newspapers'
advertising
(inaudible)
as
a
playboy
form
of
magazine.
would
that
make
that
those
issues
in
the
newspaper
subject
to
seizure
given
such?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
on
the
face
of
it
(inaudible)
advertisements
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
anytime
giving
information
directly
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
understand
that
the
--
the
statutes
reach
depends
upon
the
advertisement
being,
itself,
obscene,
but
merely
the
fact
that
advertisers
where
playboy,
assuming
playboy,
to
be
obscene,
may
be
printed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
point
is
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument
that
the
determination
of
the
paper
might
be
seized,
it
would
depend
upon
the
application
of
the
roth
test.

william

brennan,

justice

several?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
several?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
trying
to
help
you
out
a
little
bit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sure
the
--
i'm
sure
the
[laughter]
police
officers
get
no
training
in
the
distinction
between
what's
obscene
and
what's
not,
do
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
meant
formal.
justice
william

--
in
order

it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
howard,
what
was
the
elapse
time
until
the
declaration
of
a
non-obscenity
in
the
180
distributed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
and
i
thought
--
of
those
180
included
a
number
of
periodicals
monthly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
question
that
they
have
lost
