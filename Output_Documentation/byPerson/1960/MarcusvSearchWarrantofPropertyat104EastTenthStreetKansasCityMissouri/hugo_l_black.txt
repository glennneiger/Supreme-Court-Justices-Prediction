justice
hugo
l.
black
did
your
challenge
is
to
the
search
or
to
the
warrant
or
the
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
search
warrant
show
it
didn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
what
the
search
warrant
provide,
wasn't
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
--
obscene
matters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
did
not
describe
any
of
it
at
all
in
any
particularity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
are
raising
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
are
you
not,
that
what
they
have
issued
against
you
is
a
general
warrant
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
authorizes
them
to
seize
anything
they
think
obscene.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
what
assignment
did
the
court
on
123
and
124
hold
that
a
definition
of
what
they
will
get
just
obscene
or
lascivious
paper
was
a
petition
sufficient
for
his
specific
designation
of
the
property
testified
that
he
could
(inaudible)
search
warrant.
they
answered
that
on
page
123
and
124.
what
is
that
assignment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
assign
--
did
you
assign
and
set
there
that
it
was
not
sufficient
and
specific
under
the
requirements
of
the
missouri
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
assign
--
did
you
make
an
assignment
with
reference
to
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
warrant
would
have
been
sufficient
in
the
affidavit
if
it
said,
"seize
all
store
property
you
find
that
has
been
stolen
in
a
certain
building?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
exclusion
as
to
whom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
difference
between
the
exclusionary
rule
in
deciding
that
a
search
is
unreasonable
because
it's
not
made
by
a
search
warrant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
--
or
lack
of
specificity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
argument
there
was,
as
i
understand
it,
when
you
allege
--
when
you
have
a
search
warrant
that
simply
said,
"go
out
and
seize
all
the
things
that
you
find
to
be
lascivious
or
obscene
and
so
forth
in
a
certain
building
that
that
is
not
sufficient.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
the
capacity
of
a
judge
determine
--
determines
the
boundary
between
what
would
appear
to
be
susceptible
and
what
would
appeal
to
the
average
should
be
of
constitutional
level?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
an
argument
is
strong
--
an
argument
could
be
made
to
the
fact
that
if
obscene
books
do
an
injury
to
the
public
by
reason
to
their
effect
on
the
person,
probably,
the
one
that
would
mostly
--
mostly
the
protection
from
would
be
the
effect
on
the
susceptible.
justice
hugo
l.
black
don't
you
--
don't
you
think
it's
in
the
--
in
the
application
of
that
test
that
--
that
there's
a
possibility
that
it
might
occur
now
in
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
one
that
would
affect
the
average
and
the
one
that
is
susceptible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
not
think
that
when
you
begin
to
try
to
file
that
test
it
might
still
bar
some
of
those
who
--
on
the
average
if
the
real
truth
could
be
known?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
any
question
of
a
general
warrant
in
kingsley
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
this
is
not
censorship?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
that
keep
it
from
being
censorship
which
you
just
said?
but
it
is
for
the
censorship
to
see
if
it
has
things
in
it
that,
as
you
say
the
court
had
said,
could
be
suppressed?
