mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
--
of
missouri
supreme
court.
and
it
presents
the
questions
of
the
--
literally
of
this
missouri
scheme
for
dealing
with
the
seizure
of
alleged
obscene
material
raising
the
question
whether
the
missouri
statutes,
in
allowing
the
seizure
of
alleged
obscene
material
prior
to
any
judicial
determination,
that
the
material
is
in
fact
obscene,
whether
or
not
that
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
press
clauses
of
the
federal
constitution
and
whether
the
application
of
the
missouri
statutes
by
allowing
police
officers
to
go
forth
under
a
general
warrant
authorizing
them
to
go
to
six
distributors
of
publications
and
seize
all
obscene
matter,
and
to
describe
as
all
obscene
matter,
whether
that
also
is
an
unconstitutional
violation
of
the
freedom
of
speech
and
press
clause.
the
other
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
the
publications
condemned
in
this
particular
case
or
ever
condemned
by
a
constitutional
test
of
obscenity.
now,
this
court
has
noted
--
has
postponed
the
jurisdictional
question
to
the
hearing
on
the
merits.
and
the
first
--
i
shall
first
get
into
the
statutory
scheme
and
then
the
particular
facts
to
this
case
and
then
discuss
the
jurisdictional
question.
the
statutes
involved,
they
are
set
forth
on
page
35
of
appellants'
brief.
section
542.380
of
the
missouri
statutes
provide
that
upon
a
complaint
under
oath
by
--
in
writing
an
essence
to
a
judge
that
certain
scribed
property
is
being
kept
that
the
judge,
if
he
finds
reasonable
grounds,
may
issue
a
search
warrant
for
the
described
property.
and
then,
the
section
further
provides,
at
paragraph
(1)
that
ceratin
gambling
paraphernalia
might
be
seized,
we're
not
concern
with
that.
and
in
paragraph
(2),
which
is
set
out
on
page
36,
it
provides
that
obscene
articles
which
were
kept
for
the
purposes
of
sale
distribution
or
circulation
may
be
seized.
then
in
paragraph
(3),
another
part,
we're
not
concern
with
here,
it
deals
with
contraceptive
devices.
in
paragraph
(4),
which
has
an
incidental
bearing
on
the
case,
it
--
it
allows
not
only
the
seizure
of
say
obscene
material
but
any
material
used
to
manufacture
say
this
--
any
alleged
obscene
material.
the
other
provisions
of
the
statutes
provide
that
the
warrant
shall
describe
the
articles
to
be
seized
and
that
the
person
from
whom
the
article
is
seized
shall
have
notice,
that
the
officer
who
seizes
the
material
shall
retain
in
his
possession
until
after
a
hearing
and
that
the
judge
issuing
a
warrant
shall
hold
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
items
should
be
seized.
now,
in
addition
--
now
and
then
finally
if,
after
a
hearing,
these
items
are
found
to
be
obscene,
their
destruction
may
be
ordered
or
they
may
be
held
for
purposes
of
criminal
prosecution
and
then
the
destruction
ordered.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
broad
enough
to
include
a
printing
press
if
it
was
manufacturing
alleged
obscene
material.
now,
in
addition
to
the
statutory
scheme,
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
promulgated
rules
under
the
missouri
constitution.
it
has
that
right
providing
the
rules
only
deal
works
as
procedure.
now,
it
has
promulgated
rule
33,
and
it's
--
which
is
set
out
on
page
38
of
the
appellants'
brief.
under
this
rule,
it
set
--
it
sets
forth
requirements
of
a
complaint
for
a
search
warrant.
and
it
says
that
a
--
such
a
complaint
may
issue
if
--
if
there
is,
in
certain
premises,
personal
property,
if
--
whose
seizure
is
authorized
by
statute.
and
it
provides
two
conditions
under
which
such
a
complaint
may
issue.
number
one,
if
the
complaint
is
verified
under
oath
and
it
states
fact
positively
and
not
upon
information
and
belief,
the
judge
must
issue
a
search
warrant.
however,
if
it
states
evidential
facts,
then
the
judge
must
find
probable
cause.
now,
in
the
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
facts
are
these.
it
goes
back
to
1957.
and
on
october
the
8th,
1957,
a
police
officer
went
to
the
wholesale
distributor,
and
he
spoke
to
the
wholesale
distributor
and
apparently
must
have
looked
over
what
the
wholesale
distributor,
what
sort
of
magazines
this
distributor
was
--
was
distributing
this
entire
stock.
this
distributor
was
the
principle
magazine
distributor
in
--
in
greater
kansas
city.
then
on
october
the
9th,
he
went
to
the
five
retail
newsstands
involved.
and
on
each
of
the
five
newsstands,
he
purchased
one
magazine.
now,
it
so
happens
that
there
were
--
he
purchased
actually
three
different
magazines
in
all.
in
other
words,
there
were
some
duplications
of
--
of
what
he
purchased.
then
on
the
next
day,
he
went
and
he
filed
a
complaint.
and
that
complaint
--
they
are
all
alike,
and
it
was
stipulated
that
they
are
all
alike
except
for
differences
in
name,
and
that
complaint
is
set
out
on
page
two
of
the
record.
now,
all
that
complaint
states
is
that
on
october
the
10th,
1957,
the
police
officer,
and
--
he
describes
the
premises.
there
is
no
argument
about
the
description
on
the
premises
being
alright.
that
certain
persons
have
kept,
and
this
complaint
goes
--
follows
the
wording
of
the
missouri
statute,
section
542.380,
have
kept
for
the
purposes
of
selling,
publishing,
exhibiting
and
giving
away
obscene
books,
and
then
it
goes
--
follows
the
entire
wording
of
the
statute
obscene,
lewd,
licentious,
indecent
and
lascivious
books.
that's
all
the
complaint
state
--
stated
and
that
was
--
each
of
the
six
complaints
were
identical
except
they
had
different
descriptions
of
the
new
--
of
the
newsstand
and
wholesale
distributor
to
be
searched.
but
they
all
describe
what
was
being
possessed
in
the
same
general
terms
of
obscene.
then,
he
presented
this
to
the
--
a
trial
judge
in
the
circuit
court
of
jackson
county.
the
judge
heard
no
evidence.
he
presented
no
magazines
to
the
judge.
all
he
presented
to
the
judge
were
these
complaints.
so,
the
judge
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
the
wholesale
distributor
was
also
searched.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
distribute
all
types
of
magazines
to
the
greater
kansas
city
area.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
doesn't
show
whether
they
distribute
newspapers,
your
honor.
they
distribute
--
i
know
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
lifetime
--
any
--
they
distribute
salary-composed
--
i
mean,
those
were
in
seized,
but
they
distribute
it.
now,
whether
they
also
distributed
some
types
of
newspapers,
i
do
not
know,
and
the
record
doesn't
indicate.
this
is
the
major
magazine
distributor
in
kansas
city.
now,
then,
the
judge,
just
acting
on
these
complaints,
issued
the
search
warrant,
which
is
set
out
on
page
three
of
the
record.
and
this
search
warrant
was
directed
not
to
the
police
officer,
this
is
little
wired
thing,
not
to
the
police
officer
who
even
filed
the
complaint
and
who
had
visited
the
newsstand,
that
was
directed
to
any
peace
officer.
and
the
--
the
search
warrant
recites
that
whereas
this
complaint
had
been
filed
alleging
that
there
are
obscene
material
at
these
various
places
and
there
--
that
--
and
actually
issued
a
separate
search
warrant
for
each
place,
that
the
--
and
--
and
whereas
he
found
probable
cause,
therefore,
he
--
he
commands
any
peace
officer
to
execute
the
warrant
by
day
or
night.
it
actually
was
executed
in
the
daytime
and
to
seize
all
--
all
the
obscene
material
at
these
various
premises.
in
other
words,
what
he
does
is
he
adopts
the
language
of
the
complaint
in
essence.
now,
pursuant
to
the
search
warrants,
the
police,
in
the
sheriff's
office
in
kansas
city,
went
to
these
five
magazine
--
retail
magazine
distributors
and
the
one
wholesale
distributor
and
seized
various
magazines.
apparently,
the
search
at
the
--
at
the
retail
distributors
last
about
a
--
and
seizure
lasted
about
an
hour
and
a
half
and
at
the
wholesaler,
about
three
--
three
hours.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
our
--
my
--
our
challenge
is
to
the
--
is
number
one
is
to
the
statute
on
its
face
as
being
unconstitutional.
and
number
two,
it
goes
to
the
application
of
the
statute
in
allowing,
it's
sort
of
an
alternate
challenge,
in
allowing
such
a
general
seizure.
in
other
words,
assuming
that
the
statute
could
be
constitutional,
it
certainly
cannot
be
constitutional
if
--
if
you
allow
him
to
go
out
and
just
seize
all
obscene
books
without
making
any
effort
whatsoever
to
describe
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
do
that.
i
don't
think
the
statute
on
its
face
does
not
do
that.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
on
its
face,
you
have
this
problem.
if
you
don't
consider
the
construction
of
it
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
--
the
statute,
if
i
am
operating
a
newsstand
and
i
am
selling
magazines
and
tabloid
newspapers,
the
statute
says
that
a
--
if
somebody
files
a
complaint
and
yet
interpret
the
statute
and
the
rule
together
just
a
general
complaints
stating
positively
that
i
have
obscene
material
on
my
premises
that
the
police
can
go
out
there
and
seize
what
they
wish.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
--
it's
--
it
does
so
state
that.
but
the
missouri
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
to
--
to
mean
that
if
you
allege
that
there
are
obscene
publications
on
the
premises
that
that's
sufficient.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
assuming
you
had
--
let's
--
let's
go
a
little
backwards.
suppose
you
had
a
--
a
search
warrant,
like
in
the
kingsley
books
case
in
which
--
in
the
kingsley
book
case,
there
was
a
complaint
and
pendent
to
the
complaint
was
these
12
booklets
under
the
general
description
of
"nights
of
horror".
okay,
under
--
under
kingsley
books,
you
have
a
situation
that
you
can
--
this
court
said
you
can
restraint
the
distribution
of
--
of
"nights
of
horror"
by
issue
--
by
issuing
a
temporary
injunction,
but
the
court
didn't
say,
?you
can
go
out
and
seize
it.?
it
left
open
the
question
whether
or
not
suppose
i
am
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
agree
with
the
--
the
prosecuting
attorney,
i
don't
agree
with
the
police.
i
think
i've
got
something
important
to
say.
and
if
i'm
in
new
york,
and
they
have
this
restraining
order,
and
they
come
out,
and
they
inventoried
my
stock,
and
i
think
i've
got
something
to
say,
i
can
still
go
and
say
it.
i
mean,
nobody
says
i
can't
say
it
now.
i
maybe
subject
to
contempt
punishment
for
doing
it,
but
i
still
have
the
right
to
go
out
and
sell
these
books
or
give
them
away.
but
in
missouri,
they
--
they
don't
give
me
that
option.
they
go
out
there
and
they
seize
these
books
prior
to
any
determination
that
they
are
in
fact
obscene.
in
new
york,
you
cannot
seize
the
books
until
after
the
judicial
hearing.
and
that's
why
i
say
the
statue
is
void
on
its
face.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
your
honor.
it's
--
we
don't
set
out
--
we
set
out
--
you
sort
of
--
you
can't
really
put
this
in
tight
--
airtight
compartments.
you
can't
really
separate
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourth
amendment.
our
basic
objection
is
a
first
amendment
objection.
in
other
words
--
but
the
first
amendment
objection
also
embrace
the
situations
where
there
is
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
that's
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
there
as
never
a
criminal
prosecution
formed.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
just
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that's
--
that's
--
i
have
to
say
that's
part
of
it.
you
see
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
doesn't
--
i
have
to
say
it
doesn't
specifically
say
that.
it's
--
it
says
this
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
but
--
well
--
pardon.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
alright.
now
--
pardon.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
on
page
123
of
the
record,
page
123
of
the
record.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
page
123
of
the
record.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
in
that
particular
instance,
it
goes
into
the
description
of
what
may
be
--
what
sort
of
description
is
required
by
a
warrant
in
missouri.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
wasn't
that
clear,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
so
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
i'd
say
we
did.
you
see
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
on
--
on
page
--
we
start
off
on
page
118
where
we
--
the
court,
it
goes
into
the
question
and
bound
paragraph
of
118
in
the
record
where
it
says,
the
appellants
charge
that
these
statutes,
and
the
court
rule,
are
violative
of
their
constitutional
rights
under
the
first
amendment.
then,
they
compare
the
missouri
procedure
with
--
they
talked
about
near
versus
nebraska
--
minnesota
and
then
they
compare
the
missouri
procedure
with
the
procedure
in
new
york.
and
incidentally,
it
doesn't
show
in
this
particular
printed
record
but
on
the
page
119
in
the
sixth
lines
from
the
bottom,
it
says
the
constitutionality
of
the
penal
obscenity
statutes
was
--
was
attacked
in
the
becker
case.
the
original
opinion
written
by
division
number
two
of
supreme
court
said
the
constitutionality
of
these
obscenity
statutes
were
attacked
in
the
becker
case.
and
we
pointed
out
in
err
that
they
were
in
error
that
the
--
this
statute
wasn't
involved
in
the
becker
case.
they
changed
it.
so,
then,
they
go
on,
on
119,
and
talked
about
our
contention
that
we
have
a
right
--
we
argue
we
had
a
right
to
circulate
this
matter
prior
to
a
judicial
determination
that
the
matter
was
obscene.
and
they
go
on
there
and
compare
our
situation
with
the
kingsley
books
case
and
say,
well,
the
kingsley
books
--
when
--
when
this
court
upheld
the
kingsley
books
case,
then
in
essence
upheld
a
missouri
statute,
and
that
the
only
difference
is
between
missouri
law
and
new
york
law
is
a
difference
in
--
in
degree.
that
--
we
are
all
dealing
is
with
the
missouri
provides
with
a
hearing
from
five
to
20
days
after
the
seizure,
and
new
york
provides
for
a
hearing
with
one
day
after
seizure
and
a
decision
two
days
after
the
hearing.
now,
i
think,
there,
it's
clear
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
considered
this
to
be
an
attack
on
the
statutes
and
the
rule
on
its
face.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
(inaudible)
as
applied
--
actually
they
lump
them
together.
that's
right.
i
hope
i
answered
your
question.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
hope
i
can
answer.
i
--
i
tried
before,
and
i'll
try
again.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
now,
i'd
say
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
they
interpret
as
the
meaning
of
what
is
required
in
a
complaint
is
--
is
not
putting
a
gloss,
and
i
think
that's
putting
a
gloss
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
--
i
go
back
to
--
to
page
123
of
the
record
in
their
opinion
where
they
say
the
--
the
--
wipe
not
the
--
the
gloss
on
the
--
on
the
what's
required
on
a
complaint
is
on
the
bottom
of
124
and
at
the
top
of
125,
where
they
say
that
--
that
since
this
rule
3301
allows
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
if
the
officer
in
his
complaint
states
positively
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute
that
--
that
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
probable
cause.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
here's
what,
at
124,
it
says
with
respect
to
probable
cause,
the
separate
complaints
by
applications
for
the
search
warrant
which
were
sworn
to
by
the
lieutenant
of
the
kansas
city
police
department
represented
the
circuit
court
by
the
police
lieutenant
and
assistant
prosecutor
of
jackson
county.
the
complainants
swore
to
the
facts
of
his
own
knowledge
and
the
court
made
a
finding,
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
believe
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
to
be
true
and
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant.
supreme
court
rule
3301
further
defines
the
statutory
procedure
and
provides
that
the
judicial
officer
shall
issue
a
warrant
if
the
complaint
is
verified
and
supported
by
affidavits
stating
evidential
facts
for
which
such
judge
or
magistrate
authorizes
the
--
magistrate
determines
the
existence
of
probable
cause.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
the
--
our
objection
is
not
but
he
sworn
the
fact
to
his
own
knowledge,
our
objection
is
the
fact
they
only
swear
is
that
there
are
obscene
publications.
he
doesn't
say,
there's
no
description
on
publications.
in
other
words
--
in
other
words
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
or
--
or
he
can
describe
--
or
he
can
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
it
described
them
like
a
volume
five
of
adam
magazine.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
designative.
in
other
words
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
the
description
--
well,
there
are
two
problems.
problem
number
one
is
the
issue
of
--
in
other
words,
the
problem
as
to
what
the
court
that
--
that
this
statute
doesn't
require
any
preliminary
finding
by
a
court
that
there
are
obscene
matters
at
a
certain
premise.
problem
number
two
is
the
fact,
assuming
the
court
has
found
a
probable
cause
for
certain
(inaudible)
for
the
issuance
of
the
search
warrant,
it's
our
position
that
the
executing
officer
should
more
or
less
--
the
administerial
officer
shouldn't
have
any
discretion
to
see
if
anything
which
he,
himself,
feels
fits
the
general
description
of
obscene,
in
other
words,
whereas
obscene
maybe
be
a
perfectly
good
standard
for
a
court
when
it's
operating
in
the
framework
of
a
trial
in
determining
whether
to
condemn
a
book
or
not.
it
isn't
a
good
standard
for
an
officer
who
just
makes
an
on
the
spot
seizure
of
certain
items.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
officer
actually
--
yes,
well,
i
would
say
that
that's
--
that's
the
point.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
that
--
that's
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
that's
right.
that's
what
happened.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
search
warrant
also
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
they
consider
the
fact
when
you
say
there's
been
a
search
warrant
alleges
obscene
material.
they
say
that's
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
and
--
and
they
consider
that
a
sufficient
designation.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
search
warrant
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right,
search
warrant
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
search
warrant
is
on
page
two,
three
and
four
of
the
record.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
when
this
case,
only
to
explain,
i'm
answering
your
question,
your
honor.
this
case
was
originally
argued
before
the
supreme
court
division
number
two
which
transferred
to
the
supreme
court
en
banc.
we
file
a
supplementary
brief.
and
in
the
supplementary
brief
--
brief,
we
thought
that
something
wasn't
specific
in
that,
so
we
added
a
new
assignment.
now,
the
supreme
court
en
banc
adopted
the
opinion
of
the
--
adopted
the
divisional
opinion
plus
they
also
filed
a
per
curiam
opinion
on
page
--
which
is
set
forth
at
page
127
of
the
record.
in
the
--
in
the
per
curiam
opinion,
they
treat
our
assignment
relative
to
the
issuance
of
this
general
award
and
saying,
well,
that
adds
nothing
to
what
you've
argued
before
the
division."
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
i
--
we
--
i
think
i
--
i
did,
your
honor.
we
have
our
brief,
our
supplemental
brief
which
were
not
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.it'd
be
not
in
the
printed
record
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
thought
they
did
,your
honor.
i
thought
when
they
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
i
think
on
page
118.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
our
primary
--
in
the
court
--
in
the
missouri
supreme
court,
our
principle
objection
was
amendment
one
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
didn't
specifically
mentioned
the
fourth
amendment
a
law
and
--
and
the
--
our
argument
in
--
was,
as
far
as
the
federal
law
was
concern,
was
that
she
could
--
it's
alright
under
--
perhaps
on
the
fourth
amendment
--
assuming
it's
alright
under
fourth
amendment
to
seize
gambling
paraphernalia
of
this
way,
you
can,
under
the
first
amendment,
seize
items
like
these,
which
might
infringe
our
free
speech.
now,
in
--
on
page
118,
it's
--
it
set
--
on
the
bottom
paragraph
this
court
says
specifically
"the
appellants'
charge
of
these
statutes
of
the
court
charge
that
these
statutes
and
the
court
rule
are
violative
of
their
constitutional
rights
of
freedom
of
speech
and
press
guaranteed
by
article
i
section
8
constitution
of
missouri
1945
and
amendment
one
of
united
states
constitution
as
granted
applicable
by
--
by
the
privilege
and
immunities
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it's
the
--
it's
the
court
on
page
--
it's
our
opinion
that
the
court,
on
page
119
and
120,
was
treating
both
the
first
amendment
and
the
missouri
free
speech
and
press
amendment.
they
considered
all
these
--
considered
these
federal
cases
involving
the
subject.
they
specifically
considered
the
kingsley
books
case.
it
was
argued
that
way.
i
have
to
agree
that
it
specifically
amend
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
so
i
---
i
think
that's
another
indication
that
they
were
considering
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor.
actually,
the
case
--
as
i
read
the
opinion,
the
case
was
argued
in
--
from
its
inception
primarily
on
the
basis
of
the
kingsley
books
case
that
was
a
big
case.
the
state
relied
on
in
the
--
in
the
trial
court,
and
there
was
a
big
case,
the
supreme
court
relied
on
in
the
--
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
and
actually,
they
were
treating
this.
in
--
our
assignment
of
there
on
that
which
is
similar
to
the
one
that
we
set
forth
in
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
that
--
that
clarify
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
that
clarifies
any
vagueness
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
it
answers
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
on
page
127
and
128
in
the
per
curiam
opinion,
the
court
fortifies
the
issue
as
--
that
this
case
deals
with
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
they
recite
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
they
recite
--
one
of
our
assignments
of
error.
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
is
--
that
is
one
of
our
assignments
of
error.
it
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
in
the
missouri
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
yes.
in
the
missouri
supreme
court,
you
--
instead
of
having
questions
presented
in
your
brief,
you
have
what
is
known
as
points
relied
on.
and
in
those
points
relied
on
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
would
be
the
same
as
an
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
well,
in
other
words,
the
missouri
supreme
court
will
review
your
points
relied
on
provided
when
you
have
a
constitutional
question
and
has
to
be
kept
alive
and
preserved
in
the
lower
court.
and
if
i
may
i
just
set
forth
on
our
--
in
our
supplemental
brief,
the
first
point
relied
on
was
the
court
erred
in
issuing
a
search
warrant
in
its
finding
in
section
542.380
and
section
542.400
of
rule
33
of
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
constitution
for
the
following
reasons.
one
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i'm
reading
from
my
--
my
points
relied
on
in
--
in
missouri
supreme
court.
it's
not
in
the
written
record.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
one,
these
sections
of
rule
are
unconstitutional
in
allowing
a
search
warrant
to
be
issued
in
the
property
there
set
forth
in
section
542.380,
seize
export
without
notice
without
any
hearing
reported
to
the
owners
of
the
property
prior
to
such
---
prior
to
such
seizure
for
the
reason
that
they
allow
a
search
and
seizure
of
books,
pamphlets
and
other
publication
without
notice
or
any
hearing
reported
for
the
owners
and
the
property
prior
to
seizure
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
these
books,
pamphlets
and
other
publications
are
obscene,
lewd,
licentious,
indecent,
lascivious
or
of
an
immoral
or
scandalous
character
and
thereby
--
thereby
constitutes
a
prior
restrain
or
censorship
of
said
publication
impairing
appellants'
freedom
of
speech
and
publication
and
contravention
of
article
i
section
8
of
the
missouri
constitution
and
the
freedom
of
speech
and
press
clauses
of
american
--
of
amendment
one
of
the
united
states
constitution.
and
such
impairment
of
appellants'
speech
and
press
deprives
them
of
their
privileges
and
immunities.
they
are
citizens
of
their
property
without
due
process
of
law
has
guaranteed
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
and
due
process
clause
of
amendment
fourteen
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
by
reason
of
foregoing
the
search
and
seizure
were
unreasonable
and
constituted
a
violation
of
article
i
section
15
of
the
missouri
constitution."
that's
one
of
our
assignments.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
--
i'll
read
it
to
you,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
"the
court
erred
in
finding
the
search
warrants
valid
for
the
following
reason.
they
were
illegally
issued
because
the
complaints
for
their
issuance
of
the
warrants
of
sales
did
not
contain
a
description
of
the
personal
property
to
be
seized
for
and
--
and
searched
--
to
be
searched
for
and
seized
in
sufficient
detail
and
in
particularity
to
enable
the
person's
serving
the
warrant
to
readily
ascertain
and
identify
the
same
and
thereby
violated
the
rule
3301
(b)
of
the
rules
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
and
further
did
not
describe
the
things
to
be
seized
as
nearly
as
may
be
and
thereby
made
the
search
and
seizure
unreasonable
in
violation
of
article
i
section
15
of
the
missouri
of
constitution.
they
were
issued
without
sufficient
showing
of
probable
cause
and
therefore,
each
search
and
seizure
were
unreasonable
and
constitute
a
violation
of
article
i
section
15
of
the
missouri
constitution
and
rule
3301
of
the
rules
of
the
court."
then,
the
assignment
continues
and
sets
forth
what
is
said
out
on
page
127
and
128
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
where
it
says
you
--
the
division
of
opinion
on
the
wards
is
sufficient
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
next
paragraph
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
federal
constitution.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
the
next
paragraph
makes
that
assignment
and
that
is
quoted
verbatim
on
page
127
and
128
of
the
per
curiam
opinion
which
is
there
issued
after
the
hearing
en
banc.
now,
that's
of
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
the
--
yes.
but
the
--
the
brief
was
filed
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
brief
was
probably
--
this
case
was
probably
argued
in
the
january
session
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
and
so
the
brief
was
probably
filed
in
--
in
the
prior
december.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
say
it
have
troubles
stating
that
search
warrant.
i
mean
--
of
course
--
then
you'd
had
the
whole
problem
of
wolf
versus
colorado.
in
other
words,
it
probably
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
as
this
court
had
it
in
this
previous
mapp
case
you
--
you
--
probably,
it
will
leave
it
up
to
the
states
to
fashion
their
own
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
now,
as
i
understood
your
question,
you
asked
me
if
--
if
a
--
a
search
warrant
would
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
that's
right.
in
other
words,
you
would
say
as
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
and
--
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
isn't
--
that
isn't
sufficient
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
sir?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
--
that
was
the
argument.
we
say
that
if
--
if
all
you
had
was
gambling
paraphernalia,
this
court,
under
the
wolf
case,
probably
wouldn't
step
in
to
it.
the
--
somebody
was
convicted
on
that
but
we
say
when
you
have
a
situation
or
you've
got
freedom
of
expression
and
you've
got
a
--
a
search
warrant
which
is
--
which,
in
its
effect,
that
doesn't
discriminate
and
it's
too
broad
that
under
such
circumstances,
this
court
should
hold
the
--
that
procedure
unconstitutional.
now,
in
the
--
in
the
few
minutes
that
i
have,
i'd
like
to
compare
this
case
with
the
kingsley
--
kingsley
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
just
to
clarify
one
point
of
missouri
procedure
which
the
court
may
be
unfamiliar
with,
the
--
as
i
point
out,
the
points
relied
on
--
on
the
brief
served
a
reflection
of
the
assignment
errors,
and
they
are
generally
limited
by
your
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
other
words,
you
can't
--
it's
not
like
federal
practice
where
you
do
not
have
to
file
a
motion
for
new
trial.
but
on
the
missouri
law,
you
have
to
preserve
your
assignments
there
in
your
motion
for
a
new
trial.
and
our
motion
for
a
new
trial
is
set
forth
on
page
93
of
the
printed
record.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
as
far
as
any
constitutional
question
under
missouri
law,
it
has
to
be
specifically
raised.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
the
opinion
on
page
--
on
--
from
page
104
to
114,
that's
the
opinion
written
by
judge
starkman
(ph)
when
the
court
was
sitting
in
division
number
two.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
then
en
banc
and
as
an
actuality,
they
adopted
the
division
number
two
opinion
and
that's
set
forth
on
page
160
it's
the
--
it's
the
same
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
word.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
addition,
when
they
came
down
with
their
decision,
they
wrote
that
per
curiam,
short
per
curiam
opinion
which
is
set
out
on
page
127.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
now,
to
sum
up
in
--
in
reference
to
this
case,
the
major
distinctions
between
this
case
and
the
kingsley
books
case,
in
kingsley,
there
is
a
--
injunction
is
issued
but
no
books
were
seized
prior
to
any
hearing.
kingsley
applies
--
allows
an
injunction
against
a
specific
publication.
there
was
no
general
prohibition
against
a
sale
of
books
and
kingsley
was
sustained
in
comparison
with
a
criminal
statute.
and
the
court
taken
a
pragmatic
view
state
--
holding
there
is
little
difference
between
kingsley
in
the
ordinary
criminal
statute.
in
essence,
the
person
still
would
have
the
right
to
circulate
prior
to
a
determination
that
the
publications
were
obscene.
and
in
kingsley,
the
courts
specifically
pointed
out
there
was
no
restraint
upon
matters
not
yet
found
obscene.
now,
the
other
question
in
this
case
is
this,
it's
our
position
that
a
proper
test
of
obscenity
was
never
applied
to
the
publications
in
this
case.
the
court
found
some
obscene
and
found
others
not
obscene.
it's
our
position
that
the
trial
judge
applied
a
test
judging
the
effect
on
the
susceptible
person
rather
than
the
average
person,
and
in
essence,
did
what
this
court
said
shouldn't
be
done
primarily
in
the
butler
versus
michigan
case
and
then
subsequently
in
the
roth
--
in
alberts
case.
the
trial
judge's
opinion
is
set
forth
on
page
81
of
the
printed
record.
in
that
opinion,
the
trial
judge,
on
page
83
says,
?what
test
must
be
applied??
and
he
quotes
form
several
missouri
cases
and
quotes
from
the
state
versus
becker
case
which
we
have
set
out
in
--
in
the
appendix
to
out
--
to
appellants'
brief
and
that
is
set
forth
on
page
41
of
the
appendix,
the
earlier
opinion
in
--
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
in
state
versus
becker.
and
all
these
tests
and
the
test
of
the
trial
jury
are
set
forth
on
page
84,
our
test
which,
in
essence,
judged
the
obscenity
on
the
basis
of
what
effect
the
book
or
publication
has
in
the
susceptible.
and
then
after
applying
this
test,
the
trial
judge
concludes
that
certain
of
these
publications
were
obscene,
and
concludes
and
says
on
page
85,
"a
judgment
has
been
entered
this
day
in
conform
--
in
conformity
with
the
views
expressed
herein."
then,
on
page
91
and
92
is
the
judgment
and
the
--
in
the
judgment,
the
trial
judge
said
that
the
various
publications
listed
in
the
schedule
which
he
found
were
obscene
--
were
obscene
within
the
meaning
and
intent
of
mo.
rev.
stat.,
542.380.
now,
on
appeal,
we
contended
--
we
contended
that
the
becker
case
was
not
in
line
with
roth
and
kingsley
book
--
of
roth
and
the
butler
case.
the
missouri
supreme
court
differed
with
us
and
said
--
and
now,
the
becker
case
sets
forth
a
proper
constitutional
standard
of
obscenity.
it
--
it
relied
on
pouring
on
the
fact
that
in
the
roth
case,
the
becker
case
was
cited
in
the
footnote
as
applying
the
proper
test
of
obscenity.
we
think
that
any
reasonable
reading
of
the
becker
case
indicates
that
it
adopted
the
susceptible
person
test.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
yes.
that
--
that's
our
opinion.
that's
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
in
--
in
the
butler
case,
this
court
struck
down
a
statute
which
allowed
a
--
a
judge
to
mull
a
conviction
to
stand
on
the
effect
on
--
of
a
publication
on
youth.
in
other
words,
it's
our
position
here
that
if
you
have
a
susceptible
test,
what
you
are
doing
is
your
limiting
the
distribution
of
books
to
adults
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
it's
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
you
couldn't
make
that
argument
except
if
you
made
that
argument,
then
you
would
have
a
situation
where
the
average
normal
person
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
read
certain
books
because
the
abnormal
would
be
affected
by
them.
in
other
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
--
the
application
of
test
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
oh,
i
--
i
would
say
so.
i
think
it's
a
very
--
very
difficult
test
to
apply,
but
i
--
i'm
not
sure
i
knew
--
say
that
the
roth
case
should
be
overruled.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
would
satisfy
--
that's
the
--
that's
the
only
relief
we
are
--
relief
--
that's
a
relief
we
are
asking,
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
would
have
the
lawsuit
unless
missouri
would
attempt
to
proceed
in
some
other
manner
which
i
don't
know
which
way
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
if
the
books
were
returned,
it
would
end
this
case.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor,
it
was
never
a
prosecution.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
we
haven't
read
nor
conceded
they
are
obscene.
your
honor,
we
--
on
--
the
questions
presented
here
is
what
we
did.
we
--
our
--
our
second
question
presented
deals
with
the
test,
we
started
to
constitute
--
unconstitutional
test
was
applied
to
obscenity.
and
then
we
put
a
third
question
which
we
put
in
the
footnotes
saying
that
we
didn't
think
these
books
were
obscene
but
since
they
are
over
92
of
them,
we
don't
think,
since
we
were
asking
for
discretionary
relief,
even
though
--
even
though
we
weren't
govern
by
certiorari,
we're
going
to
appeal.
we
--
we
prefer
to
rest
our
case
primarily
on
the
other
two
issues.
and
we
didn't
want
to
burden
this
court
with
making
an
examination
of
these
books
when
we
think
it's
--
it's
the
job
for
the
missouri
courts.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
hope
--
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
know
specifically
what
the
jurisdictional
question
is
other
--
other
than
what
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief.
i'm
--
i'm
running
out
of
time,
so
let
me
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i'll
touch
back
on
the
--
another
jurisdictional
question.
i
thought
--
you
see,
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
didn't
oppose
jurisdiction,
so
i
sort
of
had
assume
what
the
jurisdictional
question
was
troubling
the
court.
and
in
view
of
mr.
justice
whittaker's
questions,
i
thought
that
was
the
prime
question
troubling
the
court.
another
question
which
troubled
me
somewhat
is
--
is
this
problem
of
--
here,
the
court
has
said
some
of
these
--
one
of
our
objections
was
whether
or
not
these
books
could
be
seized
prior
to
a
judicial
determination
that
the
books
were
obscene
or
not
obscene.
well,
now,
we've
had
a
hearing
and
so
that
--
that's
somewhat
worried
me,
say,
well,
don't
we
have
a
situation
or
perhaps
the
--
your
complaint
is
--
is
sort
of
moot.
but
i
think
in
--
in
an
analysis
of
this
missouri
statute,
is
such
that
it
can't
be
separated.
in
other
words,
this
entire
missouri
statutory
scheme
rest
on
a
seizure
and
the
only
basis
or
the
only
jurisdiction
for
the
--
for
missouri
to
condemn
these
books
is
if
these
books
are
seized.
so,
it's
our
position
if
the
--
if
the
seizure
itself
is
illegal
that
the
entire
scheme
would
fall.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
--
i
assume
we
could've
--
we
would
have
the
right
to
go
in
the
federal
court
and
ask
for
a
three
judge
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
--
of
the
missouri
statute.
of
course
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
here,
we
are
already
in
missouri
court.
but
the
only
other
thing
we
could
have
done
in
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
--
missouri
is
we
can
file
a
--
a
motion
for
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
missouri
supreme
court.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
our
--
mandamus
ordering
the
return
of
the
--
of
the
books.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
we
could
have
done
that.
now,
i
like
to
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
--
for
my
rebuttal.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
before
con
--
concluding
my
argument
in
view
of
the
questions
in
the
court,
i
would
ask
to
leave
the
file
with
the
clerk
the
briefs
that
appellant
filed
in
missouri
supreme
court
so
the
court
will
be
able
to
look
and
to
see
what
assignments
to
be
made
in
the
briefs
if
the
court
so
desires.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
now,
just
to
clear
up
certain
misimpressions
that
i
think
appellees'
argument
might
lead
to,
the
missouri
supreme
court
actually
did
not
determine
that
these
magazines
were
obscene.
this
can
be
seen
from
page
127
of
the
brief.
all
the
missouri
--
missouri
supreme
court
said
is,
"the
judgment
shall
not
be
set
aside
unless
clearly
--
clearly
erroneous,"
and
then
they
said,
"we
do
not
find
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
to
be
clearly
erroneous
in
any
respect."
