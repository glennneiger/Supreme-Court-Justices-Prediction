justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
you
--
let's
see
if
i
understand
what
it
is
you're
complaining
about.
you
--
in
answer
to
justice
whittaker,
you
said,
you
claim
the
statute
on
its
face,
offends
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
are
hereon.
justice
whittaker
then
asked
you
to
point
out
what
on
the
face
in
terms,
and
you
then
shifted
and
said,
"it
isn't
want
the
statute
said,
it
was
the
court
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
said,"
is
that
right?
isn't
that
what
you
said?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
--
well,
on
its
face
doesn't
mean
that
we
sit
here
and
independently
read
statutes
from
missouri
or
idaho
or
anywhere
else.
a
statute
comes
here
with
a
construction
by
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
state
court
leaps
the
faith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
get
a
leap
of
faith,
don't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
there
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
--
wherein
the
opinion
of
the
court
--
as
the
court
add
days
for
us
to
crack
things
which
--
which
makes
the
statute
read
differently
than
a
mere
innocent
reading
without
any
gloss
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
is
it?
what
is
it?
what
part
of
the
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
in
your
view
makes
inroads
on
what
seems
to
be
mere
english
of
the
statute?
well,
let's
say,
you
can
seize
everything
in
site,
and
you
don't
have
to
pay
any
attention
to
designation
or
definition
of
what
it
is
to
be
seized.
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
i
find
out
--
that
was
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
specifically
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
only
ascertain
these
things
by
the
english
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
does
it
say
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
haven't
answered
mine.
i
want
to
know
what,
in
the
missouri
--
what
--
to
what
extent
or
in
what
way
the
missouri
supreme
court
added
to
or
subtracted
or
equalified
what
i
would
find
if
i
merely
read
the
missouri
statute
and
did
not
have
the
authoritative
gloss
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
which
were
of
--
is
the
missouri
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
essential
to
your
case,
isn't
it,
your
answer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
essential
to
your
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
the
statute
comes
here
later
with
the
meaning
put
on
it
by
the
missouri
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
answer
to
justice
whittaker,
you
indicated
that
the
statute,
the
mere
english
of
the
statute
nowhere
allows
a
search
at
large.
it
must
be
defined
appropriately.
now,
to
what
extent
or
where
does
the
missouri
supreme
court
wipe
that
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
it?
just
--
i'm
not
denying
anything.
i
don't
know,
that's
why
i'm
asking
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
do
i
find
that?
i
don't
find
that
on
page
124.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what's
the
inadequacy
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
--
before
that
--
before
that,
123,
they
say
that
it
is
unreasonable
searches.
there
must
be
specific
designation
of
specific
property
and
on
page
124
stated
enough
to
state
generally,
the
search
warrant
must
--
must
define
what
is
you
are
looking
for.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
matter
with
the
complaint
that
says
that
--
that
he
swore
the
fact
of
his
own
knowledge.
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
need
to
append
the
picture
or
describe
in
great
detail
what
the
contents
of
the
--
of
the
materials
are,
is
that
it?
he
would
say
they
are
obscene
because
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't
give
a
description
that
makes
it
obscene,
is
that
your
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
--
is
--
that's
--
that
is
what
is
authorized
to
be
done
here,
what
was
authorized
to
be
done
here,
allow
the
officer
to
go
in
and
examine
a
lot
of
literature
and
then
and
there
determine
what
is
and
what
is
not
obscene,
is
that
what
the
point
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

goes
into
a
lot
of
books
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
lot
of

--
justice

--
and
he
must
pick
out.
he
has
no
guidance
from
the
one
as
to
what
it
is
he
is
to
pick
out.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
at
large
and
he
must
say
?yes,
this
is
obscene
--
justice

frankfurter
--
and
this
isn't."
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
the
record
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
the
court
said
you
must
designate
specifically.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
--
i
thought,
on
page
124,
they
say
we
can't
see
the
contrary.
it
is
not
sufficient
to
describe
the
properties
as
good
whereas
merchandizers

generally
but
the
search
warrant
commanding
the
seizure,
it
was
damage
we
were
talking
about
and
the
same
thing
on
page
123.
i
thought
they
had
to
designate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
need
at
large
to
find
out
what
isn't
--
what
isn't
obscene
among
a
hundreds
of
pamphlets.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
the
--
where
is
the
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
a
--
is
a
statement
in
a
brief
--
again,
i
am
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
nothing
about
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
jury
lawyer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
except
what
i
have
told.
is
a
statement
in
a
brief
equivalent
of
an
assignment
of
error
which
is,
i
understand
from
what
has
been
said
between
you
and
justice
whittaker,
are
requisite
for
review
ability
in
the
missouri
supreme
--
justice

court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
to
make
an
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
--
does
that
satisfy
the
requirement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
making
an
assignment
of
error?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
same
as
an
assignment
of
error?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
assignment
of
error
is
a
very
technical
term.
it
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
same
day,
the
same
day.
it
dated
the
same
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
understand
that,
but
i
say
this
all
happens
in
the
same
day.
if
the
--
the
en
banc
opinion
is
dated
march
14
--
justice

--
1960
and
the
per

is
likewise
march

1960,
is
that
rights
justice

alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
right
on
the
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
glazer,
are
you
reserving
time
for
yourself
with
regard
to
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
you
need
to.
you
can
leave
it
on
your
brief.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
(voice

--
justice
felix

could
you
--
could
you
have
enjoined
after
the
unlawful
seizure
further
--
further
proceedings
in
--
in
missouri?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
the
deponent
of
that
missouri
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
against
the
trial
of
the
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
have
done
that,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
agree
that
problem
of
general
warrant
is
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
howard,
their
--
their
brief
on
the
merits
does
raise
the
--
the
validity
of
the
test
of
obscenity
applied
by
your
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
courts
below,
they
study
one
of
the
--
the
appellants'
brief,
mr.
howard.
the
courts
below
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
on
the
bottom
of
page
32
on
appeal
the
appellate
court
found
that
its
decision
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
nearly
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it's
--
on
page
33,
again,
as
the
result,
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
not
squarely
meet
the
issue
as
to
whether
to
the
test
applies.
all
i'm
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
this,
it
isn't
a
clear
--
it
is
an
unequivocal
surrender
of
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
an
independent
test
by
the
supreme
court
but
an
independent
test
applied
practically
de
novo
to
the
materials
before
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
a
wrong
test
by
the
trial
court
doesn't
infect
the
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
turns
on
whether
this
statute
is
--
whether
direct
obscenity
dissemination
under
your
statute
can
be
dealt
under
your
statute.
because
if
it
can,
i
suppose
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
advertising
things
that
are
illicit,
assuming
they
are,
would
likewise
within
the
power
of
the
state,
within
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
answer,
may
i
make
sure
that
i
understand
your
starting
point.
are
you
addressing
yourself
--
would
you
be
addressing
yourself
to
the
question
as
i
understood
that
a
search
warrant
may
direct
searching
officers
to
seize
all
obscene
matters
found
on
the
premises
at
6
--
27
south
(inaudible)
street?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that
i
get
the
--
reach
the
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
that
the
officer
will
have
to
examine
the
materials
and
exercise
a
judgment
what
--
on
what
is
and
what
is
not
obscene.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
going
to
address
to
yourself
as
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
constitutional
power
of
missouri.
not
propriety.
i
don't
care
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
constitutional
power
of
missouri
to
make
such
authorization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
want
to
--
want
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
interrupt
your
answer
to
justice
whittaker's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
after
--
this
is
--
in
--
in
case
of
a
criminal
statute
that
a
charge
made
against
the
defendant
under
--
under
such
a
statute,
and
there's
a
trial,
there's
a
contest
etcetera,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
all
that,
that
complicated
procedure,
that
protective
procedure
is
all
embodied
in
the
exercise
of
judgment
by
the
police
officer,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
in
effect
--
is
the
--
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
suggesting
that
the
judgment
that
he's
allowed
to
exercise
under
such
a
procedure,
is
that
which
comes
at
the
end
of
a
criminal
trials
in
open
court
contest,
pro
and
con,
examination
of
witnesses,
lawyer's
objections,
lawyer's
argument
etcetera,
etcetera.
and
so
i
said
that
that
complicated
process
of
a
trial
is
all
lodged
in
the
judgment
of
the
police
officer
making
the
search,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
must
forecast
what
is
going
to
happen
in
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
isn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
suggesting
of
his
or
that
forecasting
of
his
is
put
to
the
test
by
giving
him
a
day
in
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
here,
with
reference
to
seizure,
he
has
no
day
in
court,
he
has
merely
inaction
by
the
police
officer,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
seizure,
so
far
as
that
seizure
is
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
those
--
when
the
goods
were
seized
or
the
material
were
seized,
as
justice
harlan
indicated,
to
that
extent,
until
there
is
a
disposition
in
a
proceeding
following,
to
that
extent,
he
is
already
put
in
a
position
of
having
withdrawn
what
he
may
believe
to
be
illicit
good,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
the
other
thing
--
in
the
--
in
the
criminal
case,
he
can
keep
on
selling
these
things
until
finally
a
jury
comes
in
and
the
judgment
verdict
against
them
is
broad
and
the
verdict
is
sustained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
but
in
the
criminal
case,
he
had
the
opportunity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
pitting
his
judgment
and
continuing
in
the
market
as
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
he
has
no
such
opportunity
because
the
police
officer
cuts
it
short.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
if
in
fact,
if
the
jury
brings
in
a
verdict
of
acquittal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
he
hasn't
been
out.
the
judgment
has
been
vindicated.
but
if
here,
in
fact,
there's
been
a
seizure
and
subsequently,
it
is
found
that
the
good
were
not
obscene,
he
has
been
out
of
an
exercise
of
free
enterprise
as
to
those
points
--
as
to
those
goods.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
determination
of
his
--
of
his
--
what
he
conceives
to
have
been
his
freedom
of
action
in
one
case
as
the
result
of
a
process
you
should
have
a
jury
and
a
judge
in
this
case.
it's
beyond
--
it's
--
it's
the
single
judgment
of
a
police
officer
guided
by
what
he
has
been
instructed
is
to
be
deemed
obscene
or
not.
that's
the
wording.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
not
only
initiates
but
it
concludes
something
for
a
time
being.s
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
concludes
the
withdrawal
from
his
disposition
of
the
things
that
the
police
officer
seized.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can
have
a
kingsley
statute
which
is
very
different,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
no,
it
doesn't
say
that.
that
isn't
what
kingsley
said.
it
certainly
didn't
say
it
except
after
one
or
two
or
four
days,
whatever
it
is,
until
there
is
a
determination
which
i
get
to
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
only
after
adjudication.
there
wasn't
an
injunction.
the
mayor
of
a
city
can't
go
into
court
under
the
new
york
statute
and
right
away
get
an
injunction
pendente
lite.
that
has
to
be
litigated.
and
the
statute
provide
with
--
with
an
argument
of
this
very
problem
by
saying,
"you
must
get
two
days
notice.
the
case
must
come
on
in
forth
and
the
question
of
--
of
a
pendente
lite
injunction
is
itself
litigated
and
must
be
determined
within
four
days,
so
that
you
got
a
judicial
oversight
of
this
power
of
restriction.
i
think
i'm
right
about
that,
mr.
howard.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
court
had
something
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
one
session
of
pendente
lite?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it's
done
only
by
giving
four
days
notice,
as
i
see
that.
as
end
of
four
days,
the
thing
comes
on
at
once.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
it
isn't
an
allegedly
proceeding
but
then
we
don't
alleged
