justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
the
statute
do
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
on
its
face,
by
any
terms
in
the
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
what's
the
matter
with
the
statute
on
its
terms?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
he?
i
thought
that
section
542.390
required
the
warrant
specifically
to
describe
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
thing
to
be
seized.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
getting
into
the
second
question
maybe,
as
to
whether
there
are
something
wrong
with
the
statute
as
applied.
but
as
to
the
statute
on
its
face,
my
question
was,
what's
the
matter
with
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
not
the
court
there
dealing
specifically
with
your
attack
upon
the
statute
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
missouri?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
this
will
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
make
any
attack
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
until
your
motion
for
rehearing
under
the
first
amendment
saved
on
the
definition
of
obscenity.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
court
didn't
treat
with
the
damage
you
did,
did
it,
on
page
121
of
the
record,
the
plea
with
your
first
amendment
claim
with
reference
to
the
test
of
obscenity?
but
all
other
constitutional
claims,
if
they
treat
with,
as
raised
by
you,
relate
to
the
state
constitution
and
law,
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
you.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'll
tell
you
please
--
what
i
like
to
see
is
your
assignments
of
error
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
wherein
you
said
to
that
court
that
the
lower
court
had
erred
in
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
this
--
of
this
warrant
which
did
not
describe
with
particularity
,
have
you
had
such
an
assignment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
i
like
to
see
(inaudible)
your
--
the
assignment
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
wherein
you
complain
that
the
lower
court
had
erred
beyond
sustaining
this
warrant.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
didn't
raise
it.
i
think
you
may
agree
that
you
have
to
raise
it
specifically
on
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
didn't
raise
it.
it's
not
there
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
it
isn't
here.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
did
you
raise
it
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
that's
a
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
supreme
court's
opinion
does
not
fit
with
that
point,
does
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
under
the
first
amendment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
of
course
have
read
lthat
and
i
have
overlooked
it.
but
now,
then,
when
you
come
to
why
you
say
that
that
is
so,
the
only
treatment,
it
was
on
page
121,
and
it
relates
to
the
proper
test
of
obscenity.
now,
then,
you
show
me
some
other
place
in
that
opinion
that
doesn't
deal
exclusively
with
the
constitution
of
missouri,
and
its
laws
or
that
makes
any
mention
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
that
would
mean
more
than
as
it
did
mean
to
me
and
may
be
i
didn't
get
the
whole
significance
of
it.
these
are
the
reasons
why
we
say
that
this
statute
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
of
missouri.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
didn't
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
reading
the
assignments
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.

does
the

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
howard
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
do
you
not,
at
the
threshold,
have
to
sustain
the
court's
action
in
denying
petitioner's
motion
to
suppress
or
to
return
these
goods?
if
--
if
the
court
was
wrong
about
that,
then
there
was
--
there's
nothing
before
the
court,
was
there?
and
how
do
you
sustain,
if
that's
right,
how
do
you
sustain
the
missouri
court's
action
in
overruling
that
motion
to
return
for
those
motions?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
provide
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
assuming
that
may
be
so
as
they
applied
to
quantities
of
goods,
would
it
be
so
as
we
(inaudible)
"obscene"
matters?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that
before
we
ever
got
to
those
questions,
we've
got
to
find
that
you
came
and
that
the
state
did
come
into
possession
of
these
things
under
a
lawful
warrant
gauged
by
the
command
of
the
first
amendment,
do
we
not?
before
we
ever
reached
these
questions
you're
talking
about.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
would
that
be
then
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
by
the
result
of
its
exercise
of
what
you
find?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
say
that
because
the
product
of
the
search
is
obvious
obscenity,
hardcore.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
wouldn't
that
be
then
to
judge
the
validity
of
the
search
warrant
by
the
results
of
the
search?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
you
would
--
if
you
determine
the
form,
you
would
never
reach
the
latter.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
when
these
officers
went
out
to
execute
this
warrant
and
they
go
to
the
trial
jurors,
they
take
some,
they
fill
out
of
it,
just
like
sorting
apples,
isn't
it?
now,
aren't
--
isn't
that
police
officer
then
operating
as
his
own
censor
board?
what
controls
him?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
might
be
at
one
pile
and
you
in
another
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
you
throw
out
stuff
that
i
keep.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
is
that
what
the
law
contemplates
when
it
says
the
warrant
shall
specifically
describe
the
thing
to
be
seized?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
would
say
from
my
examination
of
the
box
of
goods
that
they
used
pretty
good
discretion.
