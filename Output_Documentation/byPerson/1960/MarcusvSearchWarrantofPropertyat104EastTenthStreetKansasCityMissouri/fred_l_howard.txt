mr.
fred
l.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
view
of
the
question
of
jurisdiction
here
and
the
way
it
is
related
to
the
third
point
in
these
briefs
which
has
to
do
with
the
test
applied
by
the
trial
court
and
determine
the
issue
of
obscenity,
i
would
like
to
consider
those
two
matters
somewhat
together.
as
far
as
jurisdiction
is
concern,
it
appears
to
me
first,
that
there
is
in
fact
no
substantial
federal
issue
involved
here
on
the
question
of
the
statutory
scheme
itself.
it
is
a
contention
of
the
state
that
those
questions
have
been
resolved
against
appellant
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
kingsley
books.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
but
likewise,
the
question
of
any
substantial
federal
question
involved
is
often,
as
i
understand
it,
important
in
these
jurisdictional
matters,
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
to
be
raised.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
has
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
that
either
the
appeal
is
not
necessary
or
they
should
be
affirmed
without
more
due
on
the
basis
of
kingsley
books.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
your
honor.
there
was
no
question
of
any
warrant
in
that
case.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
third
point
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
it
is,
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
and
which
i
will
get
to
in
a
minute
if
i
may.
the
third
point
in
both
of
the
briefs
has
to
do
with
the
issue
are
the
test
used
by
the
trial
court
in
determining
the
issue
of
the
obscenity
of
the
magazine's
publications
before
the
trial
court.
i
submit
that
that
issue
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
it
was
not
properly
before
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
and
the
supreme
of
missouri
pointed
that
out.
now,
this
case
was
tried
in
the
trial
court
before
the
judge
alone
without
a
jury.
in
such
circumstances
in
missouri,
the
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
is
in
effect
de
novo
on
both
the
law
and
the
evidence.
the
exhibits
were
before
the
supreme
court
of
missouri.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
specifically
announced
that
it
had
examined
those
exhibits,
that
it
had
applied
the
test
for
obscenity
as
set
out
by
this
court
in
the
roth
case.
and
that
applying
such
test
to
the
exhibits,
at
the
supreme
court,
determined
that
they
were
obscene.
consequently,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
was
not
clearly
erroneous,
and
it
would
not
be
reversed.
now,
remember
in
this
procedure,
the
trial
court
in
missouri
makes
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
only
when
specifically
requested.
there
was
no
such
request
in
this
case,
but
the
trial
court
did
write
an
opinion
which
in
effect
was
fortuitous
and
which,
under
the
practice
of
missouri,
has
no
binding
effect
upon
any
other
court.
it
is
absolutely
surplusage.
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
pointed
that
out
in
its
opinion
that
they
were
not,
in
any
way,
concerned
with
that
that
the
appeal
is
not
from
the
opinion
of
the
trial
court,
the
appeal
is
from
the
judgment
entered
by
the
trial
court.
that
judgment
appears
in
the
record,
the
pertinent
party
is
on
page
92.
and
if
i
may
paraphrase
it
in
an
effect
says
that
we
have
examined
the
exhibits
and
find
that
they
are
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious,
indecent
--
obscene,
lewd,
licentious,
indecent,
lascivious,
immoral
and
scandalous
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
here
involved.
that
was
the
judgment
and
that's
what
the
appeal
was
from.
the
question
on
what
test
he
used
actually
was
not
important
after
these
matters
were
looked
at
by
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
because
under
these
circumstances,
if
the
supreme
court
had
said,
you
are
right,
the
trial
court
used
a
wrong
test
of
what
they
have
done.
if
they'd
reversed
the
decision,
they
would
reverse
it
and
said
to
the
trial
court,
your
decision
first
was
wrong
because
of
the
opinion
you
wrote,
because
of
the
test
you
used.
but
your
result
was
right,
therefore,
your
judgment
is
vacated
but
you
enter
the
self
--
same
judgment
again."
that's
the
only
thing
they
could
have
done
when
they
determine
by
looking
at
the
evidence
and
by
applying
the
test
for
obscenity
that
these
matters
were
in
fact
obscene
and
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
was
not
erroneous.
so,
it
would
have
been
an
entirely
useless
purpose
for
that
matter
to
have
been
considered.
now,
if
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
think
the
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
believe
that
that
question
is
not
before
you,
your
honor.
not
for
that
reason
but
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
appellant
has
specifically
refrain
from
presenting
that
issue
to
this
court.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
your
honor,
the
--
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
they
say
there
are
two
questions.
they
say
there
was
a
third
question
that
is
the
fact
issue
of
obscenity,
but
they
are
specifically
refraining
from
presenting
the
fact
issue
of
obscenity
to
this
court.
so,
consequently,
the
record
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
but
we
are
not
presenting.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor,
and
they
did
not
proceed
the
brief
that
are
to
consider
the
matter.
and
therefore,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
however,
if
this
court
should
consider
that
the
matter
of
the
test
applied
by
the
trial
court
is
an
issue.
i
submit
that
the
test
applied
and
as
intended
for
by
appellant
is
proper.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
applied
by
the
trial
court,
as
i
understood
it,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that
--
point
three
there,
your
honor,
starts
out
the
opinion
of
the
trial
judge,
shows
that
he
apply
an
unconstitutional
test
for
obscenity.
and
that,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
gist
of
their
argument
in
point
three
of
their
brief.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
the
court
found
that
its
decision
in
becker
was
approved
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
roth
because
becker
was
listed
in
the
footnote.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
now,
they
--
they
--
and
that
refers
back
to
the
becker
case
which
was
--
they
claim
the
basis
for
the
trial
court's
decision.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that
it
may
be
enforced.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
it's
not
unequivocal.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
in
fact
it
is
a
surrender,
but
i'm
going
to
rely
entirely
upon
such
surrender
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
because
in
considering
the
becker
case,
the
missouri
supreme
court,
and
i'm
reading
from
100
--
page
110
of
the
record.
this
is
the
divisional
opinion
but
the
divisional
opinion
was
adopted
in
october
by
the
court
en
banc,
so
it's
the
same
thing.
it
appears
twice
in
the
record.
the
supreme
court,
in
referring
to
the
becker
case,
quoted
the
test
used
in
the
becker
case,
as
these
questions
have
been
considered
and
tested
objectively
as
to
the
effect
of
these
publications
in
their
entirety
upon
persons
of
average
human
instincts.
they
say
that
that
test,
as
set
out
in
becker,
is
compatible
and
in
effect
the
same
as
the
test
this
court
set
out
in
roth
which
the
missouri
supreme
court
paraphrased
as
being
that
the
standard
by
which
obscenity
is
tested
is
?whether
to
the
average
person,
applying
contemporary
community
standards,
the
dominant
theme
of
the
material
taken
as
a
whole,
appears
to
prurient
interest."
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
missouri
supreme
court
said
that
the
becker
standard
was
comparable
to
that
from
roth
and
even
if
the
matter
was
before
the
court
that
the
trial
court
did
not
earn
relying
on
roth.
now,
if
i
may
refer
to
the
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right.
but
my
point
also
is
that
if
you
should
determine
that
i
am
wrong
in
that
assertion,
their
claim
of
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court
is
not
well
founded
for
this
reason.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
to
the
same
100
exhibits
that
the
trial
court
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
have
found
in
the
benches.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right,
of
the
supreme
court
of
missouri,
yes,
your
honor.
now,
as
i
have
said,
the
--
the
fact
issue
of
obscenity
had
not
been
pressed
by
the
appellant
here
and
therefore,
i
submit
that
we
are
--
this
case
now
i
stands
in
the
posture
that
the
exhibits
--
the
matter
seized
are
to
be
considered
as
having
finally
determined
to
the
obscene
under
the
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
roth
case.
and
that
the
questions
here
at
issue
should
be
determined
on
that
basis.
now,
the
appellants
contend
that
there
has
been,
under
the
missouri
statute,
an
unconstitutional
previous
restraint
upon
their
rights
of
freedom
of
press,
apparently,
is
based
primarily
on
the
fact
that
under
the
statute,
pardon
me,
the
search
warrant
issues
on
the
application
of
the
--
in
this
case
the
police
officer
who
swore
to
that
search
warrant
as
a
matter
of
his
own
knowledge.
the
court
found
that
the
facts
so
sworn
to
were
sufficient
to
establish
probable
cause.
the
search
warrant
was
issued.
the
search
was
made.
the
publications
here
we
had
books,
we
had
magazines,
we
had
pamphlets,
we
had
just
plain
photographs
and
packages.
those
matters
were
seized
and
brought
before
the
court.
the
court
issued
its
notice
of
hearing
when
required
to
be
set
not
less
than
five
nor
more
than
20
days
after
the
date
of
the
seizure
and
then
return
on
the
matter
seized
into
the
court.
at
that
hearing,
the
person
from
whom
they
were
seized,
in
this
case,
the
book
seller
or
anyone
else
who
claims
an
interest
may
come
in
and
contest
the
fact
of
obscenity
and
ask
the
books
to
be
return
to
whoever
had
the
right
to
them
under
their
claim.
the
court
passes
upon
the
issue
of
obscenity
in
an
expeditious
manner.
and
if
they
are
determined
to
be
obscene,
orders
them
destroyed
or
held
for
evidence
if
necessary
in
a
prosecution
and
then
destroyed.
if
the
court
determines
they
are
not
obscene,
they
are
returned
to
the
owner,
in
this
case,
the
book
seller.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
in
this
particular
case,
the
--
start
out
on
the
10th
of
october
and
the
opinion
came
down
some
considerable
time
later
because
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
were
injected
into
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
court
did
a
lot
more
than
december
the
12th,
appellant
says.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
sir?
from
october
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
the
10th
to
--
from
october
the
10th
when
they
were
seized
until
december
the
12th
of
the
same
year,
november,
december,
two
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
two
months
and
two
days.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
two
months
and
two
days,
i
believe,
under
that
theory.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
when
they
start
to
have
this
hearing
on
the
question
of
obscenity,
we
have
long
motions
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
and
the
constitutionality
of
the
procedure
and
everything
else
which
--
on
which
evidence
was
taken
and
which
was
submitted.
briefs
were
submitted
to
the
trial
court.
there
was
time
given
for
briefs
on
the
constitutional
issues
and
things
of
that
sort
which,
of
necessity,
extended
the
time
beyond
what
it
would
have
been
if
the
only
issue
were
are
these
things
obscene
or
are
they
not
obscene.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
hearing
was
set
within
that
time
limit.
but
because
of
the
issues
involved,
the
final
determination
was
delayed
for
approximately
two
months.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
your
honor,
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
only
one.
there
may
have
been
other
but
this
is
the
only
one
to
reach
an
appellate
court.
there
may
have
been
others
in
the
trial
court
that
the
attorney
general
of
missouri
has
no
knowledge
of.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
i
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
it
would
not
be
because
this
is
the
only
one
i
know
about,
and
i
think
it's
the
only
one
where
it's
--
it's
been
used
for
obscenity.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes.
there
were
a
number
of
them
hold
such
as
adam
and
playboy
and
nugget
and
a
whole
string
of
them
your
honor.
most
of
which
i
never
heard.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i'm
sure
that
--
some
of
them
were,
some
of
them
were
quarterlies
and
some
of
them
were
undated.many
of
them
were
monthly
dated
magazines.
so
that
you
have
a
variance
in
your
fact
situation
from
one
exhibit
to
the
other,
but
they
were
numerous
that
were
monthly
dated
magazine.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
i
saw
the
map
of
the
argument
in
missouri
supreme
court
before
the
motion
for
rehearing.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
doubt
if
there
would
be,
your
honor,
except
as
applying
the
test.
now,
in
applying
your
test,
i
can't
very
well
see
how
a
daily
newspaper
would
reasonably
be
figured
that
it
would
--
the
prime
purpose
of
that
would
be
devoted
to
prurient
interest
whereas
in
your
magazine
there
are
more
classified
and
less
general
and
therefore,
the
application
of
your
test
would
be
different.
but
i
think
the
same
test
would
apply
where
the
contents
of
the
two
comparable.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
your
honor,
i
submit
that
this
is
in
no
manner
censorship.
if
we
were
going
to
have
a
form
of
censorship,
i
suppose,
constitutionally,
it
would
apply
to
newspapers
as
well
as
magazines.
i
can
see
no
constitutional
basis
for
differentiating
between
them.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
why
do
i
say
that,
your
honor?
because
this
does
not
prohibit,
in
any
manner,
the
publication
of
anything
that
one
desires.
it
is
not
constitutionally
censorship.
all
this
does
is
remove
from
circulation
that
which
is
without
a
constitutional
protection
under
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
under
that
definition
and
perhaps,
it
would
be
censorship.
what
i
have
myself
normally
considered
censorship
is
that
which
says
you
can't
publish
until
it
is
approved.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
have
coordinated
it
too,
yes,
your
honor,
perhaps,
improperly.
but
i
submit
here
that,
at
any
--
at
any
event,
there
is,
in
this
instance,
no
prior
restraint
under
the
missouri
statute
because
the
items
are
seized,
brought
into
the
court
after
they
have
been
published,
that
it
is
only
to
the
matter
which
this
court
has
determined
is
not
subject
to
constitutional
protection
under
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
press
that
is
affected.
that
is
already
destroyed
that
trafficking
in
such
items
is,
by
the
statute,
stopped
entirely.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
advertisements
of
obscene
literature,
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
not
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor,
on
that
issue.
i
--
until
this
moment,
i
had
not
considered
that.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
on
the
base
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
now
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
believe
they
would,
your
honor.
whether
or
not
the
whole
newspaper
would
be
subject
to
seizure
because
of
that
would,
it
seems
to
me,
go
back
to
a
determination
of
whether
one
advertisement
in
your
newspaper
converted
what
would
rather
be
alright
into
something
that
would
meet
your
test
because
of
that
of
what
is
obscene
and
beyond
the
constitutional
protection.
i
suspect
that
your
one
advertisement
illustration
would
still
not
subject
that
newspaper
to
seizure.
of
course,
we
don't
have
that
issue
before
us
today,
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
illustration
would
not
convert
the
newspaper
into
something
that
was
within
the
test
of
obscenity
laid
down
by
this
court.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
right.
but
i
also
think
that
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
roth
test
is
that
the
primary
impact
of
your
publication
is
on
prurient
interest.
and
if
--
although
the
advertising
may
not,
itself,
be
obscene
because
that
convert
the
primary
impact
of
the
newspaper
because
of
this
advertisement
for
something
that
is
obscene
and
therefore,
some
connection
with
obscenity
in
to
a
publication
whose
prime
objective
is
catering
to
prurient
interest.
it
would
seem
to
me
to
--
to
require
a
similar
test,
i'm
not
phrasing
it
very
good,
in
order
to
determine
that
issue,
and
i
doubt
if
the
newspaper
would
come
within
such
a
proper
test.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
think
there's
two
branches
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
i
might
say
that
i
think
there
is
quite
possibly
something
before
the
court
even
though
that
motion
should
have
been
initially
sustained
by
the
trial
court.
secondly,
when
i
was
about
to
get
to
what
will
answer
your
question,
i
believe,
is
a
question
of
the
propriety
of
this
search
warrant
address
to
anything
that
is
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious,
etcetera,
in
the
wording
of
the
statute.
i
take
it
to
judges
could
be
--
question
goes
to
whether
it
should
have
been
--
the
motion
should
have
been
sustained
because
the
search
warrant
was
bad
for
that
reason.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
i
do
not
believe,
and,
in
fact,
the
search
warrant
is
subject
to
that
criticism
for
these
reasons.
there
are,
of
course,
two
types
of
search
warrants.
one
says
you
will
go
out
and
seize
a
specific
item
which
will
be
described
as
a
--
the
january
issue
of
playboy
or
a
black
and
white
1967
chevrolet
of
a
certain
serial
number
or
whatever
it
maybe.
there
are
also
other
types
of
search
warrants
recognized
in
the
law
which
are
not,
for
a
specific
item,
but
for
r4a
described
class
of
items.
in
other
words,
you
go
out
and
seize
all
alcoholic
beverages
found
at
the
place
described.
you
go
out
and
seize
gambling
equipment
found
at
the
place
described,
you
go
out
and
seize
whatever
is
described
and
whether
you
find
one
or
three
or
five
that
it
orders
the
officers
to
seize
that.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
and
it
is
my
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
to
--
to
the
propriety.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
to
the
constitutional
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
was
not
assuming
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
no.
because
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
--
i
am
sure
several
policemen
who
exercise
warrants
who
wouldn't
be
able
to
understand
it
if
he
had
it,
so
i'm
not
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
putting
my
argument
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
on
that
basis.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
i
wanted
to
be
conservative,
your
honor,
on
that
aspect.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
as
a
practical
matter
from
experience,
they
do,
yes.
but
that's
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
that's
all
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
because
they
receive
numerous
complains
from
various
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
oh,
no,
not
formal.
i
said
only
from
experience
as
--
as
to
what
the
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
feeling
the
public
is
to
the
matter.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
some
of
them
would
assure
you
that
they
did.
[laughter]
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
as
i
was
saying
there
--
there
are,
i
believe,
two
recognized
types
of
search
warrants.
this
is
the
latter
type
whether
you
direct
the
officer
to
seize
anything
found
in
the
--
of
the
class
described.
the
warrants
in
this
case
were
worded
in
the
wording
of
the
statute,
that
is,
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious
--
obscene,
lewd,
licentious,
indecent,
lascivious
are
of
an
indecent,
immoral
or
scandalous
character.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
your
honor,
the
statute
on
that,
i
have
it
here,
i
believe,
marked.
the
statute
section
542.390
says
that
the
warrant
shall
describe
the
place
to
be
searched
or
the
thing
to
be
seized
as
nearly
as
may
be.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
description,
as
i
have
read,
in
the
wording
of
the
statute,
in
the
case
like
this,
does,
in
fact,
describe
i
think
as
nearly
as
may
be.
now,
further
--
and
which
has
been
inactive
since
the
inaction
of
that
statute,
missouri
supreme
court
rule
33.01
paragraph
(b),
which
is
set
out
on
page
39
of
appellants'
brief
in
this
court
provides
that
the
search
warrant
issued
must
contain
a
description
of
a
personal
property
to
be
searched
for
and
seized
and
the
description
of
the
place
to
be
searched
in
sufficient
detail
and
particularity
to
enable
the
officers
serving
the
warrant
to
readily
ascertain
and
identify
the
same.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
submit
that
it
does,
your
honor,
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
court
has
pointed
out,
missouri
supreme
court
has
only
pointed
out
that
under
the
criminal
statutes
which
used
the
same
wording
that
those
statutes
are
constitutionally
definite
enough
to
give
a
guide
to
a
person
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
is
violating
that
criminal
provision.
and
i
think
there
is
a
definite
correlation
between
those
cases
which
hold
such
language
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
due
process
requirements
as
to
the
definiteness
of
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
don't
quite
believe
i
follow
the
last
part
of
that
question,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
in
other
words,
you
say
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
police
officer
and
determine
what
he
is
going
to
seize
is
to
be
a
thorough
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
is
the
due
process
hearing.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
would
beg
to
disagree
with
your
honor
on
that
point
for
this
reason.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
action
of
the
individual
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
action
he
takes
is
criminal.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
forecast
what
is
going
to
happen.
and
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
in
order
to
protect
his
constitutional
rights
at
that
point,
he
is
entitled
to
a
statute
which
is
definite
enough
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
due
process.
and
my
point
is
that
that
test
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
as
applied
there.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
your
honor.
the
police
officer
is
only
a
method
of
initiating
a
day
in
court.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
if
the
seizure
were
in
--
in
and
of
itself,
he
would
be
right,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
he
can
keep
on
right
after
that
as
soon
as
he
pays
his
fine
or
serves
his
sentence
and
walks
out
to
the
door.
he
can
go
right
back
to
selling
that
again,
your
honor.
and
normally,
those
who
are
engaged
in
such
procedure
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
do
just
exactly
that.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
he
has
no
such
opportunity
as
to
these
particular
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
volumes
which
are
seized
by
the
police
officer.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
of
course,
there
is
nothing
at
all
to
keep
him
from
procuring
other
copies
of
the
same
publication
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
and
going
ahead
in
selling.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
as
to
those
particular
volumes,
he
has
been,
as
you
say,
unable
to
distribute
those
particular
volumes
during
the
short
interval
that
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
is
involved
in
the
judicial
determination.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
that
--
that
initiates
the
judicial
proceeding.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
those
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
he
was,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
because
we
are
dealing
with
human
beings
in
the
inexact
english
language
that
unless
the
court
is
going
to
say
that
constitutionally,
you
can
seize
only
a
specifically
described
item
that
cannot
be
mistaken
that
you
have
such
problems.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
but
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
your
honor.
that
says
to
him,
"you
can't
sell
any
issue
of
playboy
until
we
have
an
adjudication."
now,
that's
in
rem.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
now,
there
was
--
there
was
an
injunction
pendente
lite
in
that
case,
if
i
understand
it.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
you
weren't,
your
honor,
because
i
think
you
had
something
to
do
with
that
opinion
but
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
it
was
my
impression
in
that
case
that
on
complaint,
the
court
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
the
court
issued
on
notice
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
a
--
an
injunction
pending
the
determination
of
the
issue
of
obscenity
that
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
your
honor,
and
we
trust,
missouri
is
not
a
allegedly
proceeding
either.
i
think
that
the
difference
in
time
there
is
of
very
minor
importance.
and
missouri
statute,
of
course,
operates
against
the
individual
publication
where
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
the
same
as
the
other.
it
was
--
in
this
particular
instance,
it
was
two
months
and
two
days,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
think
it
did,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right,
that's
right,
your
honor,
in
this
case.
now,
as
i
mention
before,
i
--
i
submit
that
the
reason
for
the
delay
was
not
on
--
on
the
decision
of
the
obscenity
issue
whereupon
the
decision
of
constitutional
issues.
and
there
were
--
there
was
time
in
the
brief
cases
and
things
like
that,
i
mean,
submit
briefs
which
strung
it
out
a
lot
longer
than
if
they
only
have
the
obscenity
issue
involved.
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
missouri
here
that
the
missouri
statutory
system
is,
in
fact,
comparable
to
that
in
kingsley.
there
are
differences
admittedly.
missouri
operates
in
rem
upon
the
publication.
the
publication
is
seized,
brought
before
the
court
the
question
of
obscenity
is
determined,
and
it
is
disposed
of
either
returned
or
destroyed.
in
kingsley,
the
--
they
operate
in
personam
on
the
particular
individual.
they
filed
a
complaint
against
the
bookseller
for
having
the
publications
listed
in
the
complaint
which
they
allege
to
be
obscene.
they
proceed
to
--
to
an
expeditious
determination
of
the
issue
of
obscenity.
if
they
determined
it
is
obscene,
he
is
enjoined
from
distributing
that
--
the
books'
name.he
is
also
ordered
to
surrender
them
for
destruction.
if
he
doesn't
surrender
them,
then
there
is
order
of
seizure
to
go
out
and
get
them
and
surrender.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
of
missouri?
mr.
fred
l.
howard
the
exact
year,
i'm
not
sure,
but
it's
sometime
before
1900.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
it's
bound
on
the
books
a
long
time,
but
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
but
as
to
obscene
literature,
as
far
as
i
know,
it's
never
been
used.
missouri
has
several
statutes
that
have
been
entirely
ignored
for
long
periods
of
time.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
well,
there
is
getting
more
uproar
about
this
question,
and
i
think
there
is
getting
to
be
a
lot
more
of
what
is
normally
called
"obscene
literature"
that
it
used
to
be.
if
my
short
span
of
personal
experience
has
anything
to
do
with
it,
that
is
true.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
there
are
misdemeanor
statutes.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
and
we
have
--
in
the
becker
case,
which
we
were
talking
about
earlier
today,
was
a
prosecution
under
the
criminal
statute.
but
i
submit
that
here,
the
--
one
of
the
important
arguments
of
appellant
is
that,
is
the
appellants
have
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
the
trade
of
selling
obscene
literature,
and
they
have
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
interrupted
in
that
trade,
not
to
lose
their
profits
therefrom
that
the
hands
of
the
state
of
missouri
are
tight
and
that
the
state
of
missouri
can
only
interfere
by
way
of
enforcement
of
the
criminal
statute.
that
goes
contrary
to
the
pronouncements
of
this
court
that
the
state
is
not
limited
to
criminal
prosecution
in
order
to
protect
itself
from
obscenity
and
to
protect
its
citizens
from
obscenity.
but
the
appellants
say
that
they
have
an
absolute
right
and
that
that
is
all
that
missouri
can
do.
and
that
if
they
consider
that
it
is
economically
advantageous
to
them
to
continue
to
engage
in
this
business
and
to
run
the
risk
of
prosecution
that
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
so.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
not
true
that
they
do
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
making
a
profit
out
of
obscenity,
that
the
state
of
missouri
does
have
a
right
to
protect
its
citizens
against
the
dangers
and
the
evils
of
obscenity.
this
court
has
said
the
state
is
not
limited
to
criminal
prosecution.
i
submit
that
the
statutes
of
missouri
are
a
reasonable
procedure
to
protect
the
citizens
of
missouri
from
the
evils
of
that
which
this
court
has
said
are
not
within
the
scope
of
the
constitutional
protection
of
freedom
of
speech
and
press
from
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
therefore,
i
believe
that
the
statutes,
considered
as
a
whole,
are
not
an
unreasonable
restraint
upon
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press.
and
this
court
has
more
than
once
held
that
the
rights
under
freedom
of
speech
and
of
the
press
are
not
absolute.
they
are,
in
many
fields,
paramount,
i
will
agree
with
that.
but
i
do
not
believe
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
roth
and
alberts
and
in
kingsley
books
and
in
the
michigan
case
and
the
other
cases
going
clear
back
the
near
versus
minnesota,
that
such
a
scheme,
as
we
have
here,
does
not
constitute
a
prior
restraint
within
the
constitutional
meaning
as
that
phrase
is
applied
to
the
question
of
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
fred
l.
howard
--
that
--
first
place,
as
i
have
mentioned
a
minute
ago,
i
submit
that
this
is
a
lawful
warrant
subject
to
the
questions
and
criticisms
that
has
been
raised
here
today.
i
believe
they
are
with
--
without
sufficient
force
to
declare
it
to
be
void.
second,
i
believe
that
after
these
hearing
has
been
held
and
a
determination
has
been
made
that
these
matters
now
before
the
court,
these
100
exhibits
are,
in
fact,
obscene
and
without
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
that
if
you
say
now,
"well,
do
you
made
a
mistake
back
there
somewhere?"
that
does
not
necessarily
mean,
first,
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
or
second,
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
the
return
of
these
particular
matters.
although,
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
the
disposition
of
the
particular
exhibits
is
of
minor
importance
in
this
case.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
for
you're
in
an
action
in
rem
on
the
particular
item
itself,
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
an
action
in
personam
and
the
use
of
a
search
warrant
to
bring
evidence
against
the
person
to
be
used
in
court
or
do
something
against
the
person.
we
are
dealing
here
with
an
action
directing
at
the
objects
themselves
at
the
disposition
of
what,
in
effect,
is
contraband.
and
while
there
may
be
remedies
to
the
person
because
those
are
seized,
i
do
not
think
that
the
fact
that
the
search
warrant
may
have
been
too
broad
in
this
instance
would
necessarily
entitle
the
individual
to
the
return
of
the
contraband.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
would
be
to
say
that
even
though
you
judge
the
search
warrant
and
find
it
bad
that
as
when
you
do,
in
effect,
have
contraband
before
the
court
that
you
do
not
have
a
right
to
the
return
of
such
contraband.
there's
a
difference
there.
i
may
not
be
making
myself
clear
on
the
difference,
but
i
believe
there
is
a
difference.
and
i
think
that
that
question
is
not
necessarily
concluded
by
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
search
warrant
in
this
case
is
held
good
or
bad.
but,
i
would
want
to
add
that
if
the
search
warrant
is
held
bad
and
whether
the
consequences
this
court
holds
flow
from
that,
that
does
not,
of
course,
mean
that
there
is
any
infirmity
in
the
missouri
statutory
scheme.
it
merely
means
the
execution
of
that
part
of
it
which
provides
for
the
initial
search
warrant
was
erroneous.
and
i
don't
think
that
issue
on
the
propriety
of
the
wording
of
the
search
warrant
is
determinative
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
missouri
statutory
scheme
at
issue
here.
there
are
two
separate
questions,
i
believe.
and
if
we
assume
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
search
warrant
was
bad
that
it
is
--
does
not
follow
that
the
statutory
scheme
of
missouri
should
fall
therewith.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
you
would
not
need
to
reach
the
latter,
and
i
say
it
does
not
follow
that
the
statute
is
bad.
it
just
means
somebody,
if
you
pardon
the
expression,
somebody
goofed
when
they
issued
the
search
warrant.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
what
controls
him?
his
knowledge
of
the
english
language
and
what
is
and
is
it
not
within
the
wording
of
the
warrant
which,
as
i
have
said,
is
in
the
words
of
obscene,
lewd,
lascivious
etcetera
and
so
forth.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
think
that
is
quite
possible,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you.
i
think
that
is
quite
possible.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
think
that
that
count
was
in
it
because
the
difficulty
here
is
not,
to
my
mind,
the
lack
of
description.
the
difficulty
is
the
fact
that
the
words
of
the
english
language
convey
different
meaning
to
different
people.
and
when
you're
dealing
with
the
english
language
and
dealing
with
people,
you
are
subject
to
that.
and
either,
you
are
going
to
say
that
you
must
limit
the
search
warrant
to
a
specific
item
as
contrasted
to
a
class
of
items
to
be
described.
i
submit
that
the
description
--
the
words
used
in
this
description
are
within
the
constitutional
limits.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
no,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
members
of
the
kansas
city,
missouri
vice
squad
--
police
department
vice
squad
were
the
ones
who
actually
operating
on
the
search
warrant.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
now,
they
have
had
no
experience
in
seizure,
so
they
have
had
some
experience
in
prosecution.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
your
honor,
as
to
the
exhibits
that
are
before
the
court,
i
will
urge
very
strongly
that
those
exhibits
are
obscene
without
question.
now,
i
didn't
see
the
other
180
exhibits
that
were
returned,
so
i
have
no
comment
to
make.i
can't
say
anything
about
those
others.
some
of
them,
i
understand,
were
pretty
borderline,
but
the
decision
was,
shall
we
say,
leaned
over
backwards
in
favor
of
being
sure
that
they
did
not
err
against
the
individual,
what
they
erred
against
the
state
of
the
err
in
that
determination
at
all.
mr.
fred
l.
howard
i
believe
there
was
--
i
can't
remember,
your
honor.
there
were
two
or
three
that
did,
i
think,
out
of
the
hundred
that
did
have
those
stories
in
them.
and
of
course,
i
could
tell
you,
your
honor,
if
i
remember
there
were
other
things
besides
articles
by
those
two
authors
that
were
very
questionable
in
those
magazines,
and
i
would
say
whether
the
article
by
de
maupassant,
for
instance,
was
the
cause
of
what
have
been
declared
obscene
or
whether
it
was
other
contents
of
the
magazine.
that
would
be
my
judgment
that
that
issue
was
resolved
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
content
of
the
magazine
not
of
--
and
of
course
rather
than
on
anyone
particular
article
therein.
i
have
lost
complete
track
of
time,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
i
have
covered
enough
of
the
points
which
the
state
wishes
to
present.
and
i
submit
that
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellants
in
this
case.
