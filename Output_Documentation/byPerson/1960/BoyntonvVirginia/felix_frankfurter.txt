justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
marshall
does
your
case
rest
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
must
take
judicial
notice
of
a
document
filed
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
under
law,
if
you're
under
law,
which
was
not
introduced
and
it
came
into
the
case
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
suppose
one
had
a
difficulty
about
taking
a
judicial
notice
of
that
document.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
the
case
in
this
court,
it's
briefly
coupled
by
getting
notice
of
publicly
filed
document
in
a
utility
hearing
without
(inaudible)
has
violated
the
due
process,
that
you
can't
take
notice,
judicial
notice
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
are
not
talking
without
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
an
application
of
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
--
why
--
i
don't
see
--
quite
see
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
act
takes
care
of
you,
why
do
you
go
to
the
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
having
that
document
presently
with
the
act,
how
do
you
have
it
for
the
purpose
of
the
clause?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
intended
to
restrict.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
in
fact
joined
in
the
morgan
opinion.
i
think
i
can
ask
you
why
the
court
said,
why
opinion
says
that
congress
had
not
(inaudible)
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
know
it
did
and
i
joined
in
it,
and
i
would
ask
you
why
it
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
morgan
came
after
mitchell,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
asking
to
clear
about
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
don't
let
it
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
let
it
take
your
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
reason
for
my
question
as
so
explained
to
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
no
use
to
you,
but
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
--
i
think
it's
my
duty
not
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
but
their
concern.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
just
(voice
overlap)
--
statute
the
way
you've
argued
for
that
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
--
i
don't
quite
appreciate
why
you
have
abandoned
reference
to
the
statute
in
your
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
yet?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
between
the
restaurant
and
carrier.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
leaving
as
to
--
assume
without
this
in
court
which
the
amicus
was
included
in
its
brief,
there's
one
complete
judicial
notice,
does
if
applied
the
(inaudible)
in
showing
nexus
between
the
carrier
and
the
restaurant
as
between
this
from
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
restaurant
had
been
on
independent
(inaudible)
if
this
restaurant
were
off
the
terminal
ground
in
a
separate
building
(inaudible)
you
would
have
a
different
case,
i
take
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
would?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
take
some
of
your
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
marshall,
(inaudible)
of
this
record
is
the
inward
ratio
is
plain,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
do
you
say
that
this
is
in
the
case
of
a
restaurant
across
the
street?
not
as
the
record
that
you
confirmatively
indicate
that
this
involved
in
this
dissociated
restaurant,
dissociated
from
either
the
bus
company
or
there's
more
them
that
might
have
been
externally.
now
the
bus
terminal
is
that
a
subject
to
interstate
commerce
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
--
if
the
--
what
we
have
in
this
record
with
reference
(inaudible)
court's
relation
on
page
20
of
the
record,
mr.
marshall,
the
witness
is
in
rush
that
the
manager
of
the
bus
terminal
restaurant
was
there
as
the
company
that
operates
the
restaurant
is
not
affiliated
in
any
way
with
the
bus
company
is
it
and
the
answer
was
no
there
was
not.
the
bus
company
has
no
control
with
the
operation
of
the
restaurant
none
whatsoever.
if
i
â€“
you
can
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong
but
i
think
there's
nothing
in
the
record
bearing
on
any
question
in
narrow
arrangement
as
to
the
relations
from
the
restaurant
in
the
terminal
of
other
than
the
fact
that
there's
a
lease.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
lease.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
so
that
we
have
the
connection
between
the
lease,
between
the
terminal
company
and
the
restaurant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
in
that
way
the
denial
here
that
the
company
has
no
control,
the
bus
company
(inaudible)
what
controls
the
terminal
company
there
and
the
record
at
least
is
silent
as
to
the
relations
between
the
bus
company
and
the
bus
terminals,
except
for
the
physical
fact
and
the
inference
of
the
physical
evidence
of
the
conclusion
in
this
record
of
narrative
or
physical
fact
as
to
the
relation
that
the
bus
company
determined.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
we
know
that
has
a
connection.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
stated
as
in
complicated
way,
but
it's
true
nothing
is
said
as
to
the
relation
between
the
restaurant
and
the
bus
company
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
except
the
denial
by
mr.
rush,
but
the
record
is
replete
with
a
lot
of
inferences
to
put
it
mildly
of
the
connection
with
functionally,
between
the
bus
terminal
and
the
bus
company.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
those
are
matters
that
are
in
the
record
from
which
or
other
which
there
are
the
inferences
of
transportation
facts
of
life
can
be
drawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
--
on
this
record
if
we
had
no
more
than
this
record
and
the
motor
carrier
(inaudible),
could
this
terminal
separate
by
white
and
color?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
--
from
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
what
in
this
record
would
such
an
inference
be
allowed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
this
court
likewise
has
again
and
again
said
we
can
take
certain
notice
of
what
happen
in
the
transportation
world.
justice
felix
frankfurter
control
doesn't
--
doesn't
have
to
meet
51
percent
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
under
the
act
--
under
duty
to
furnish
those
services,
i
shouldn't
think
under
mitchell
he
could
furnish
them
discriminatorily
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
because
that
would
not
be
a
compliance
with
the
duty
of
furnishing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
that
in
defining
your
answer
to
justice
stewart
that
for
the
bus
company
itself
deal
with
own
restaurant
or
the
facilities
it
makes
available
providing
the
food
on
the
such
a
journey
is
the
facility
in
which
the
bus
company
must
serve
as
part
of
(inaudible)
bus
company?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
necessary
--
a
necessary
conclusion,
that
is
the
(inaudible)
of
many,
but
if
the
--
if
for
example
they
need
not
furnish,
they
can
make
provisions
that
they
regard
as
satisfying
that
local
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
the
(inaudible)
from
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
anderson
case
--
in
the
anderson
case.
if
they
--
if
they
have
hold
themselves
out
--
if
they
hold
themselves
back
as
part
of
the
train
travel
that
what
the
anderson
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
part
of
train
travel
(inaudible),
they
must
then
treat
the
law
equally
and
assume
they
do
on
racial
(inaudible).
but
if
that
isn't
necessary,
if
they
didn't
provide
any
kind
of
--
which
makes
no
racial
discrimination
or
anything
else,
assume
that
is
so,
i
wonder
there
is
gap
--
my
reason
--
my
reason
about
it
even
if
they
furnish
it
then
they
must
disregard
or
not
be
able
to
require.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
fact,
when
somebody
(inaudible)
facilities
accommodating
thereof
(inaudible)
of
the
court
in
accommodating
as
part
of
this
trip
--
as
part
of
what
the
bus
company
was
doing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
don't
care
how
it
was
done.
but
that
--
if
no
ownership
--
or
partnership
that
stipulates
the
bus
company
held
itself
out
from
the
old
--
the
old
terminology
of
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
held
itself
out
with
furnishing
of
food.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
asking
to
(inaudible)
to
such
a
provision
is
on
the
ticket?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
motor
carrier
act
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
what
you're
saying
is,
although
they
are
not
compelled
by
the
act
of
furnishing
services
they
may
give
more
elegant
services
(inaudible)
and
it's
legal
whatever
it
is
if
they
offered
service
within
the
general
circle
of
transportation
service
for
which
they're
engaged,
which
they're
offered,
then
they
must
offer
on
a
nonsegregated
basis
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
they
couldn't
be
compelled,
although
the
--
although,
they
didn't
see
things
not
from
that
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
there
will
always
be
a
fair
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
as
--
as
claims
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
claims
that
were
made
or
coordinately
made
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
in
the
commerce
clause,
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
entertained
way,
no
more,
no

justice

(inaudible)

yes.
but
