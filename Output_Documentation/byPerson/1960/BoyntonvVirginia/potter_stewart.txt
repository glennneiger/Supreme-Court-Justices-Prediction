justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
mr.
marshall
you're
familiar
of
course
with
interstate
commerce
commission
decision
in
1955
in
the
case
of
national
association
for
the
advancement
of
colored
people
against
st.
louis
san
francisco
railway
company
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
–
you
were
the
counsel
on
record
in
it
and
they
didn't
say
that
that
was
congress'
purpose
that
a
luncheon
in
the
richmond,
virginia
railway
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
do
you
think
that's
the
sole
basis
of
the
decision
as
for
the
distinction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
made
between
the
restaurant
and
waiting
room?
justice
potter
stewart
the
commission
says
in
concluding
its
opinion
that
they
further
find
that
the
operation
by
a
lessee
non
carrier
has
separate
lunchroom
facilities
for
white
and
colored
persons
in
the
railway
station
of
richmond,
constitutes
a
function
or
service
which
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
--
at
least
to
that
it
can
be
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
congress'
intent
was
with
respect
of
the
lessee
operation
of
a
lunchroom?
justice
potter
stewart
the
body
with
expertise
charged
with
the
administration
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
held
that
it
was
not
congress'
intention.
justice
potter
stewart
that
case
involved
the
railroad
trains?
justice
potter
stewart
with
that
in
dining
cars.
justice
potter
stewart
--
involved
the
richmond,
virginia
railway
terminal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
operation
of
the
lunchroom
by
a
lessee
in
that
term.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
pointing
out
you
state
as
a
(inaudible)
in
the
commerce
clause
and
i'm
pointing
out
maybe
distinguished
(inaudible)
but
at
least
in
the
respect
of
the
railway
terminal
in
the
same
city
of
richmond
the
interstate
commerce
commission
said
that
congress
has
intended.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
marshall,
we
have
–
you
and
i
have
traveled
on
busses,
we
know
that
a
large
number
of
their
stops,
perhaps
most
of
their
stops,
so
called
rest
stops
not
made
at
the
terminals,
they
are
made
at
private
places
along
the
way,
with
all
the
private
restaurants
that
are
on
the
roadside,
we
have
the
same
case
if
this
place
--
that
kind
of
a
place
are
this
(inaudible)
of
terminals.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
--
except
in
viewing
the
record
certainly
if
--
if
--
that
if
that's
on
this
record
it
shows
--
it
shows
no
more.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
--
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that's
the
lease
between
the
--
between
the
terminal
company
and
the
restaurant.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
shows
any
connection
with
the
terminal
company
and
the
carrier.
justice
potter
stewart
the
restaurant
along
the
roadway
is
perhaps
the
--
there
are
no
(inaudible)
primarily
to
serve
interstate
commerce.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i
was
asking.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
this
is
the
place
the
regular
bus
stop
and
there
was
boarding
place.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i'll
stop
on
that
brief.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
start
for
this
period.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
the
statute
enacted
by?
justice
potter
stewart
well
is
it
a
--it's
not
a
rendered
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
federal
statute,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
federal
court,
i'm
talking
about
the
interstate
commerce
act.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
here
on
the
ground
of
the
statute
as
applied
that's
obviously
referring
to
the
statute
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
the
interstate
commerce
act.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
--
mr.
rogers,
the
initial
trial
in
richmond
in
the
police
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
was
there
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
hustings
court?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
hustings
court?
was
it
a
general
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
it
isn't
a
trial
de
novo
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
true
is
it
not
that
there
is
a
difference
between
that
case
and
this
in
that
there,
they
were
finding
the
restaurant
was
not
an
essential
part
of
--
of
the
transportation
business
carried
on
by
the
railroad
in
that
terminal?
justice
potter
stewart
here,
there
is
no
finding
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
understand
that
this
lease
covers
both
restaurant
operations?
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
single
lessee
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
get
an
example
of
page
21
of
the
records
to
the
plain
--
portion
of
the
restaurant.
justice
potter
stewart
which
--
which
would've
defined
the
other
on
a
good
point.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
basic
answer
isn't
--
isn't
that
mr.
rogers
that
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
if
the
lessor
was
the
bus
company?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
your
basic
answer,
didn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
because
when
--
but
you
didn't
--
in
your
petition
for
writ
of
error,
you
didn't
rely
on
(inaudible)

potter
stewart
