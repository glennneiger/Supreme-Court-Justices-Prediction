mr.
walter
e.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
this
court
has
very
clear
conception
of
the
facts
in
this
case.
there
are
two
i
think
i
might
mention.
it
is
clear
that
the
petitioner
was
a
passenger
in
interstate
commerce.
his
traveling
in
interstate
commerce
would've
been
in
richmond
(inaudible).
he
left
the
bus
and
came
into
a
private
owned
and
operated
restaurant
located
in
the
terminal
building
in
richmond.
that
privately
owned
restaurant
operated
separate
facilities
for
members
of
each
race.
the
testimony
is
specifically
clear
that
the
restaurant
is
in
no
way
affiliated
with
or
controlled
by
the
bus
company.
it
operates
under
a
lease,
just
as
a
lease
of
any
other
business
establishments
at
such
of
its
term
at
least
it's
on
the
record
but
the
policies
of
the
restaurant
with
those
other
restaurant.
petitioner
came
into
the
section
which
is
reserved
for
white
patrons
and
was
informed
that
he
could
not
be
served
there,
and
that
he
would
have
to
go
into
the
other
portion
of
the
restaurant
which
is
reserved
for
negroes.
he
refused
to
leave
the
premises
and
when
he
refused
to
do
so,
he
was
directly
arrested
for
trespass
after
warning.
the
virginia
statue
is
quoted
at
page
4
of
the
brief
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth.
and
it
simply
provides
that
it
is
not
a
segregation
statute
at
all.
it
is
a
statute
which
provides
that
if
any
person
shall
without
any
authority
law
go
upon
or
remain
upon
the
grounds
of
premises
of
another,
after
having
been
forbidden
to
do
so
by
the
owner
or
the
person
in
control,
then
he
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor.
that
statute
has
been
on
the
statute
books
of
virginia
since
1934.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
1934,
it
was
enacted
as
chapter
165
of
the
acts
of
the
government
(inaudible)
in
1934.
there
have
been
one
or
two
amendments
since
that
time.
the
provision
for
sign
was
included
after
the
warning
by
signs
and
anyone
who
is
familiar
with
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
as
to
where
the
fact
of
that
provision
was
put
in
there
to
deal
with
these
unattended
parking
lots
where
automobiles
were
driven
in
a
private
property
where
there
was
no
attendants
so
that
happen
to
be
the
reason
why
that
was
inserted
in.
the
statute
does
no
more
than
impose
criminal
sanctions
--
criminal
actions
for
continued
trespass
after
the
party
is
instructed
to
leave
without
authority
--
if
he
is
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
is
true.
if
he
had
any
right
either
by
contract
with
the
party
or
anything
of
that
sort
or
--
if
he
was
proceeding
as
a
peace
officer
or
if
this
is
a
matter
involving
interstate
commerce
where
he
derives
some
way
to
go
there
as
being
an
interstate
passenger
then
he
is
there
with
authority
of
law
and
would
not
be
guilty
of
trespass
when
refuses
to
leave
but
he
has
first
got
the
authority
whereby
--
which
he
is
owned
the
private
property.
sir?
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
i
think
it
would.
well,
the
owner
has
the
record
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
in
virginia,
privately
owned
property,
the
owner
has
a
control,
that
the
owner
directs
a
party
to
leave
and
he
refuses
to
do
so,
the
offense
is
committed
unless
the
party
himself
can
bring
forward
something
to
show
his
authority
for
being
there.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
any
situation
where
a
person
owns
property,
whether
it
be
my
home,
my
store
or
my
facility
and
i
direct
somebody
to
leave
and
i
have
it
â€“-
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
and
he
has
no
authority
of
law
to
stay
there.
he's
guilty.
i
would
say
it's
upon
him
to
show
it.
it's
a
defense
to
his
actions
in
the
premises
because
i
think
you
can
say.
though,
i
don't
think
absolutely
it's
not
evidence.
this
is
an
affirmative
defense
if
he
is
going
to
show
that
he
carries
a
search
warrant
or
that
he
has
some
right
to
be
there.
the
only
right
this
man
asserted
in
this
case
was,
"i
am
an
interstate
passenger.
here's
a
ticket
i'm
using
to
ride
on
the
bus."
that
was
the
elements
of
his
contention
that
as
why
we
was
lawfully
there.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
--
that's
--
that
he
is
--
if
i
'm
on
somebody
else's
property,
and
the
owner
of
the
property
directs
me
to
leave,
he's
got
to
show
his
right
to
remain.
that
was
not
shown
here
and
if
our
position
be
correct
in
the
present
situation.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
i
know
of
no
right
that
a
person
has
to
remain
at
somebody
else's
property
after
he
has
been
ordered
to
leave.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
and,
they
offer
as
their
evidence
to
support
their
right
this
ticket
that
he
used
when
he
was
travelling
in
interstate
commerce
and
that's
all
that
he
offers
and
that's
all
this
case
is
about
as
to
whether
that
give
him
the
right,
each
claims
no
other
right.
he
offered
no
other
proof
of
it
and
that
was
why
he
was
there.
the
evidence
is
to
why
he
was
there
is
clear.
he
came
in
claiming
the
right
to
be
served
in
that
restaurant.
so,
the
question
of
why
he
is
--
is
present
in
this
case
certainly
is
before
this
court
and
has
been
before
every
court
that
has
considered
this
case.
the
question
is
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
it,
because
of
proof
for
the
purpose
that
he
was
there
and
that's
the
only
purpose
that
he
was
there,
all
the
purposes
he
pretended
to
be
there
and
if
that
gives
him
authority
of
law,
he
has
it,
but
if
that
doesn't
(inaudible),
he
doesn't
have.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
in
that
situation
our
(inaudible)
is
this.
all
of
the
evidence
here
at
page
20
of
this
transcript
is
that
this
restaurant
was
not
in
any
way
controlled,
affiliated
with
or
operated
by
the
bus
company.
the
lease,
purely
a
private
lease
between
an
owner
of
a
piece
of
property,
richmond
bus
terminal,
inc.
richmond
bus
terminal,
inc.
is
the
owner
of
this
building
and
richmond
bus
terminal
inc.
leased
this
property.
the
lease
is
in
the
record
at
14
through
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
page
9
through
17.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
as
to
who
owns
the
bus
terminal,
inc.
there
was
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
--
you
want
me
to
testify
as
to
what
i
have
heard
or
i
may
know?
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
will
be
frank
enough
to
say
this
that
the
evidence,
certified
copies
of
the
records
of
icc
of
the
application
that
were
filed
by
two
companies,
carolina,
richmond,
i
believe,
(inaudible)
showed
us
all
the
time
that
report
was
filed
that
the
bus
terminal,
inc.
was
owned
50%
by
two
operating
carriers.
they
were
the
carolina
coach
company
and
virginia
stage
lines.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
don't
know
your
honor.
the
testimony
in
that
is
that
he
came
in
on
a
trailways
bus
and
it's
my
understanding,
this
is
not
factual
evidence
either,
but
it's
my
understanding
that
trailways
is
the
name
that
designates
a
number
of
different
bus
companies
all
over
the
country
that
are
not
necessarily
affiliated
at
all.
it's
more
or
less
a
trade
name
under
which
they
--
they
operate.
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
carolina
coach
company
bus
or
a
trailways
bus
company.
virginia
stage
lines
bus
company
that
this
man
came
into
this
town
(inaudible)
or
not
or
where
there
were
some
other
carrier
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
--
it
was
a
carrier
operating
in
interstate
commerce
because
it
came
from
washington,
and
was
going
to
the
south,
but
frankly
i
do
not
know.
i
--
i
just
don't
have
the
information.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
wouldn't
think
that
the
unusual
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
no,
i
don't
consider
it
important.
i'll
deal
with
the
question,
your
honor
this
--
in
this
way.
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
this
man
is
travelling
on
a
carolina
coach
line,
one
of
the
two
companies,
that
the
record
of
gas
and
receipt
noted
the
time
of
(inaudible)
owned
richmond
bus
terminal,
inc,
50-50.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
there
is
still
no
evidence
that
richmond
bus
terminal,
inc.
controlled
or
operated
this
restaurant.
i
might
say
this
first,
as
far
as
the
assignments
of
error
are
concerned,
and
really
what
was
considered
by
the
courts
below,
in
this
case,
first
originated
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
warrant,
it's
found
on
page
6,
the
petitioner
relied
on
two
rights.
one
right
afforded
him
by
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
the
other,
by
the
interstate
commerce
clause
itself.
the
provision
as
far
as
the
act
i
believe
seems
to
be
above
except
on
the
basis
of
this
evidence
that
is
tendered
here
for
the
first
time.
the
evidence,
it
was
not
considered
by
any
of
the
courts
below.
they
haven't
considered
the
effect
of
that
one
way
or
the
other
and
these
certified
copies
of
the
icc
that
is
tendered
by
the
amicus
curiae.
that
has
not
been
before
the
virginia
courts,
either
the
supreme
court
or
the
lower
court.
that
evidence
had
been
introduced
below
what
kind
of
evidence
would
have
been
offered
regarding
the
history
of
these
companies
i
don't
know
in
meeting
that
question,
but
the
warrant
--
the
most
when
they
dismissed
the
warrant,
they
did
raise
interstate
commerce
act.
they
apparently
abandoned
it
early
in
the
game.
it
was
not
made
a
basis
of
an
assignment
of
error
to
the
virginia
supreme
court.
the
assignments
of
error
appear
on
page
5
and
the
contention
on
that
score
is
that
the
court
erred
in
refusing
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
on
the
ground
which
the
statute
has
applied,
that
is
the
virginia
statute,
unconstitutionally
attempts
to
regulate
commerce.
that
i
take
it,
it
presents
a
constitutional
question
not
a
statutory
question.
the
petition
for
writ
certiorari
to
this
court
does
not
make
this
point
that
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it's
--
i
mean,
the
interstate
commerce
act
itself
gives
this
right.
it
affirmed
this
rule
and
as
an
after
thought
here
that
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
by
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
--
motion
to
dismiss
the
warrant,
in
the
hustings
court
of
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
possibly
so.
it
--
it
was
before
the
hustings
court.
the
issue
was
not
before
the
--
the
virginia
supreme
court
by
the
assignments
of
error
and
carried
out
that.
apparently
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
the
court
on
general
jurisdiction
as
of
the
court
of
record
where
he
would
have
then
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
if
he
had
requested
that
he
was
tried
by
the
jury
by
the
court.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
trial
de
novo
completely,
the
proceedings
in
the
police
court
have
no
standing
one,
evidentiary
value
or
anything
of
that
sort
in
the
court
of
records.
it
is
the
court
just
next
below
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
line
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
believe
that
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
believe
that
federal
statutes
of
--
virginia
statutes
of
federal
decision
amount
us
a
judicial
notice.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
right.
the
restaurant
is
operated
as
one
as
a
--
in
the
terminal
building
but
it
says,
local
train
as
well
as
passengers
that
may
come
in
to
the
terminal,
whether
in
intestate
commerce
or
otherwise,
the
--
the
white
restaurant
is
in
one
section,
the
colored
restaurant
in
another.
the
petitioner
could've
been
served
there,
it
was
not
crowded,
the
evidence
shows
that.
so
that
is
the
status
of
the
record
on
that
point
here.
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
reason
i
think
that
counsel
has
not
pressed
the
interstate
commerce
act
question
is
the
fact
that
counsel
of
record
here
was
also
counsel
of
record
in
n.a.a.c.p.
versus
st.
louis
and
san
francisco
railway
which
involved
a
hearing
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
to
the
practices
of
a
number
of
operating
railroads,
the
railroad
terminal
building
at
broad
street
in
richmond,
virginia
and
also
a
leased
restaurant
facility
within
that
building
operated
by
i
believe
the
union
news.
the
icc,
the
agency
which
congress
had
set
up
to
carry
out
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
enforce
the
policies
and
declaration
of
policies
of
congress
had
the
question
as
to
whether
a
lessee
non-carrier
concern
operating
a
restaurant
in
a
terminal
building
was
required
to
serve
without
discrimination.
the
icc
held
i
believe
in
1955
and
1956
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
did
not
apply
to
such
privately
owned
and
operated
lessee
non-carrier
concern
in
the
operation
of
its
restaurant
facility
in
the
railroad
terminal
station
in
richmond,
virginia.
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
congress
has
not
taken
any
further
steps
to
extend
its
noted
power
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
to
specifically
say
that
such
a
closely
related
facility
should
be
operated
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis.
now
in
that
case,
the
icc
had
evidence
that
the
terminal
corporation
there
was
in
fact
owned
and
controlled
by
operating
carriers
in
an
interstate
commerce,
evidence
that
we
do
not
have
here
except
as
--
has
been
offered
here
by
a
(inaudible).
the
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
is
true.
it
may
well
be
true
here.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
there's
no
finding.
no
--
no
finding
about
the
court
one
way
or
the
other
but
if
the
act
had
been
pressed
and
this
question
of
operating
control
had
been
shown,
what
the
evidence
would've
been
as
developed
as
to
how
many
years
this
particular
carrier
had
been
operating
in
the
city
of
richmond,
you
got
a
terminal
facility
which
it
didn't
even
know
how
to
control
and
operate.
well,
they
have
--
it
ever
had
a
restaurant
before
that
for
19
years
or
30
years,
it
might
well
have
been
developed.
that
is
why
i
think
it
is
improper
at
this
stage
to
begin
to
consider
evidence
dealing
with
the
--
with
the
control.
conceivably,
you
might
have
an
entirely
different
--
if
the
court
below
had
considered
that,
and
if
the
litigants
had
developed
that
phase
of
the
--
of
the
question.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
i
think
--
i
think
the
difficulty
with
that
of
course
obviously
a
person
has
to
eat.
it
isn't
in
the
question,
but
that
it
takes
--
you
can
take
judicial
notice
of
that
without
any
question.
but
as
to
how,
that
service
is
pressed,
i
myself
wouldn't
let
--
i
don't
know
if
it
is
a
matter
of
such
a
common
law
as
mr.
justice
stewart
has
pointed
out
that
a
lot
of
these
places,
they
pull
up
the
side
of
filling
station
on
the
road
where
the
operation,
the
feeding
operation
is
furnished
by
somebody
that
has
no
relationship
with
interstate
commerce.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
how
those
terminals
are
operated?
well,
they're
operated
only
in
control
by
the
carriers
themselves
whether
they
are
owned
and
controlled
by
the
person
who
furnishes
a
place
for
the
buses
to
come
in,
whether
the
restaurants
in
them
are
operated
directly
by
the
bus
company,
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
which
we
could
take
judicial
notice
without
proof
of
what
the
particular
facts
were.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
i
think
as
far
as
this,
we
have
evidence
here
that
there
was
a
terminal
building
that
served
interstate
buses,
that
it
did
have
a
restaurant
in
it,
that
it
did
have
a
restaurant
in
which
some
of
the
interstate
passengers
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes.
well
(inaudible)
a
state
as
well
as
local
and
we
have
the
actual
lease
that
exists
between
the
two
corporations,
but
we
have
here
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
would
assume
so.
i
think
the
--
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
the
evidence
show
that
it
was
40-minute
layoff
and
whether
it's
a
40-minute
layoff
we
go
to
--
so
we
can
step
across
the
street
and
eat
in
a
restaurant
operated
by
me
whether
he's
going
to
eat
in
this
restaurant
or
whether
this
restaurant
serves
many
people
or
few
people
in
interstate
commerce
or
otherwise,
they
--
to
get
to
the
act
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
no,
they
are
made
by
the
operator
of
the
restaurant.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
there
are
actually
two
rooms.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
two
rooms.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
would
say
this,
the
restaurant
facility,
when
the
building
was
built,
the
restaurant
facility
was
--
the
rooms
for
it
were
built
at
the
same
time.
i
mean
it
was
part
of
the
investment.
now,
what
has
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
the
terminal
company
built
the
buildings
--
built
the
building
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
--
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
he
may
have
your
honor.
i
am
not
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
the
owner
of
the
restaurant
facilities
under
the
lease
were
to
be
put
in
by
the
restaurant.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
don't
know
your
honor.
i
think
of
such.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
on
that
as
this
to
how
much
of
the
construction
whether
they
turn
certain
space
over.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
there
ought
to
be
two
separately
operating
restaurants?
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
the
lease
of
course
is
here.
well,
i
saw
here
by
leases
itemizes
under
the
lessee
subject
to
the
terms
and
condition
hereof
all
the
term
that
the
room
space.
the
space
then
said
trailways
bus
station
or
used
by
lessee
as
a
restaurant,
lunch
room
or
sort
of
that
and
then
used
that
which
space
is
more
particularly
and
described
as
follows.
that
certain
space
in
the
basement
and
on
the
ground
floor
of
trailways
bus
terminal
to
be
constructed
at
northwest
corner
broad
street
in
the
city
of
richmond
and
assume
(inaudible)
on
two
diagrams
he
had
to
attached
and
made
a
part
here
that's
on
the
lease
of
exhibit
a
and
b
and
i
don't
--
they
were
not
introduced
by
in
evidence.
and
frankly
about
that
it
was
a
certain
space
in
the
building.
that
was
to
be
designed
by
the
restaurant
company
or
that
i
don't
know.
and
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i'd
rather
think
they
were.
it's
what
i
--
if
we
ought
to
speculate
on
it.
that's
--
that's
my
opinion
because
i
imagine
when
they
constructed
the
building,
they
constructed
(inaudible)
that
went
into
the
building
and
things
of
that
sort
although
i
don't
know.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
sir.
i
think
it
maybe
an
open
space
of
the
counter
or
table
arrangement
that
separates
them
of
whether
they
are
actually
two
separate
rooms
and
that
i
don't
know,
nothing
in
the
record
the
one
lease
--
one
lease
for
the
total
space.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
nor
did
the
lease
say
that
you
should
segregate
or
not
segregate.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
single
lessee
operating
two
restaurant
spaces
within
the
same
building
as
based
(inaudible)
to
dining
room
facilities,
lunch
counter
facilities
whatever
they
are
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
a
restaurant?
the
lease
--
the
lease
is
paid
or
used
by
the
lessee
as
a
restaurant,
lunchroom,
photo
shop
and
newsstand
which
said
space
is
described
that
was
described
by
the
few
(inaudible)
part
of
this
exhibit
that
was
introduced.
the
lessee
was
to
provide
all
of
the
facilities
as
far
as
stalls
and
restaurant
equipment
and
the
things
of
that
sort.
and
it
set
it
in
what
the
terminal
building
specified
in
the
way
of
rental
although
what
matter
of
operation
but
on
this
score
as
to
have
these
restaurants
that
would
be
operated,
that
was
a
matter
less
to
this
private
concern
using
the
space
in
the
building.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
you're
reading
from
section
7
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
is
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
will
be
true.
they
started
selling
whiskey
by
the
drink
in
the
operator
or
the
lessor
object
that
he
has
a
right
to
say
it
so.
but
the
extent
of
the
control
between
the
two
companies
is
not
specified
in
this
brief
which
is
on
the
record.
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
same
language
of
viewing
into
section
which
was
substantially
the
same
in
section
4931
dealing
with
common
carriers
and
railroad
section
i
believe.
and
in
the
chapter
300
chapter
in
section
316
(d),
with
4931
was
on
the
book
pro--prohibiting
the
carriers.
it
prohibits
carriers
as
it
prohibit
anybody
thus
performing
any
function
and
have
a
closely
all
--
distantly
related
to
interstate
commerce.
it
regulates
carriers
and
regulate
restaurant
after
all.
it
regulates
carriers.
316
(d)
again
regulates
carriers
by
motivators
and
it
prohibits
discrimination
in
any
form
by
them.
now,
the
evidence
here
as
far
as
this
terminal
is
concerned,
the
terminal
itself
as
distinguished
from
the
rest
which
under
the
control
of
the
terminal
corporation.
if
the
consideration
be
given
to
any
ownership
or
control
of
that
corporation,
the
terminal
facilities
where
there
was
no
policy
of
segregation
in
any
of
its
facilities,
it's
restaurant
and
the
like,
were
there
was
no
requirements,
the
evidence
in
this
--
and
this
right
that
it
there
was
no
segregation
at
all
in
connection
with
the
operation
of
the
terms.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
of
the
lease
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
you're
reading
from
the
top
of
page
14
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
neither
the
lessee
nor
its
employees
shall
be
allowed
to
perform
any
terminal
service
other
than
that
pertaining
to
the
operations
outlined
in
this
contract
or
shall
the
lessee
or
its
employees
sell
transportation
of
any
kind
or
give
information
pertaining
to
schedules,
rates
of
transportation
matter
that's
where
referrals
and
certain
groups
for
the
properties
of
the
lessor.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
to
--
in
--
in
the
operation
of
this
restaurant
and
you
--
you
do
nothing
else
for
us
but
operate
this
restaurant.
that
--
that's
what
you
are
suggesting
then.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
think
that's
subject
to
--
to
that
interpretation.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
there
again
there's
an
indication
that
the
terminal
operator,
the
lessor
wanted
the
modern-up-to-date
restaurant
in
its
terminal.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
is
true.
it's
obviously
that
people
do
eat,
they'd
run
in
the
terminal,
they
don't
have
a
restaurant.
we
don't
have
the
operation
and
control
except
that
we
specify
here
over
to
you,
you
do.
we're
not
there.
you
operate
this.
that
if
this
was
the
--
it's
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
no.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
there
to
the
interstate
commerce
act.
if
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
the
regulation
of
motor
carriers
required
motor
carriers
to
provide
restaurant
service,
then
i
think
they
would
be
performing
a
transportation
function
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
whether
the
--
they
directed
themselves
a
little
bit
through
at
least
operation
or
otherwise,
but
if
it
is
just
a
--
an
operation
which
is
not
required
and
if
the
terminal
building
of
the
bus
company
wants
to
engage
in
some
function
outside
if
the
field
of
interstate
commerce
then
i
don't
think
it's
an
interstate
commerce's
function.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
provision
in
motor
transportation
act.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
under
the
act
as
written
today
as
i
--
i
did
not
know
of
any
--
any
kind.
i
do
not
deny
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
may
have
such
regulatory
power.
you
conclude
that
the
furnishing
of
meals
in
connection
with
bus
transportation
is
essential
just
like
in
--
in
connection
with
the
railroad
act
where
a
person
is
on
a
train
and
he
stays
on
the
train
all
the
way
across
the
country.
they
can
be
very
much
in
order
mandated
with
that
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
would
give
the
commission
power
to
pass
a
regulation
stating
that
that
is
a
part
of
the
essential
service
which
he
may
perform.
in
some
of
provisions
maybe
in
the
act
regulating
carriers
by
motor,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
i
don't
--
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
beyond
the
--
it
certainly
would
be
improper
for
congress
to
conclude
that
bus
transportation
travel
should
do
it,
and
to
give
that
power
to
the
commission.
and
if
the
commission
has
exercised
that
power,
and
the
bus
companies
were
required,
then
i
think
it's
a
service
of
--
they
will
have
to
perform
even
direct
or
through
some
agency
where
the
lease
operation
all
the
while.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
possibly
so,
but
it's
possible
they
could
not
delegate
it
to
a
non
--
a
non-carrier
concern.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
non-delegable
function,
but
just
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
suggested
here,
he
says
this
restaurant
could've
done
nothing
but
let
this
man
sit
for
forty
minutes
until
his
bus
left
and
he
doesn't
get
up
and
leave.
he
concedes
here
that
there
was
certainly
no
obligation
on
this
restaurant
or
the
bus
company
or
anybody
else
to
provide
him
the
food.
he
is
asserting
in
that
connection
that
the
state
has
interrupted
his
interstate
commerce
here
by
stepping
into
the
picture
but
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
where
you
threw
a
rock
through
a
window.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
sir?
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
right.
and
certainly
if
he
threw
a
brick
through
the
window,
at
the
back
that
he
might
be
arrested
and
put
in
jail
over
the
weekend
or
for
10
years.
it
wouldn't
be
a
question
of
the
state
interrupting
his
interstate
commerce
journey
he
would've
interrupted
by
his
criminal
act.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
is
--
that
is
--
that
of
course
is
based
on
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
think
so.
i
think
there
were
actually
separate
roads
there
that
doesn't
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
frankly
don't
remember
your
honor.
i
have
been
in
the
--
i
have
been
in
the
restaurant
and
i
have
seem
to
recall
that
there
are
separate
--
there
are
separate
counters,
there
are
separate
rooms
but
i'm
not
sure
that
you
can't
see
over
an
open
space
either
over
the
counter
from
one
to
the
other.
it
maybe
that
i
have
in
mind
the
last
petition,
but
i
frankly
don't
--don't
remember.
i
have
been
there
and
it
--
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
--
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
there
are
two
separate
rooms
and
that's
--
that's
what
i
think
of
the
--
but
i
make
this
comment
in
this
record,
there
were
few
comments
have
been
made
a
bit
the
negro
state
of
the
record
on
the
--
on
the
issue
that
was
presented
here
as
to
the
offense,
the
testimony
that
this
was
a
privately
operated
restaurant.
the
lease
was
introduced.
the
directions
to
leave,
his
presence,
his
direction
to
leave
and
he
refused
to
leave.
that
constituted
the
case
as
far
as
the
common
law
is
concerned.
if
any
of
these
other
factors
that
we
have
been
struggling
with
here
are
important,
i
am
certain
that
able
counsel
for
the
petitioner
could
have
presented
them
and
presented
them
to
the
court
below.
now,
on
that
scope,
certainly
i'm
not
â€“
criticizing,
i
think
they
have
that
position,
he
took
his
position
that
has
in
interstate
carrier,
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
come
into
the
white
section
and
eat,
and
that
was
his
point.
he
made
it
in
the
restaurant
at
the
time
and
that's
all
it
was
stood.
and
that's
why
i
say
this
question
of
--
of
controlling
anything,
he
says
that's
because
it's
in
this
building.
and
because
these
buses
come
in
here
and
i
am
being
in
the
interstate
commerce,
i've
got
a
right
to
eat
without
being
required
to
go
into
this
section
or
that
section.
now,
if
--
if
he
would
have
flashed
ticket
on
a
bus
company
to
the
restaurant
across
the
street,
insofar
as
he
was
concerned,
the
principle
would
be
the
same
and
that's
--
that's
why
we're
here
in
this
state
of
the
--
the
record.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
would
say
if
the
bus
company
were
operating
this
restaurant,
the
bus
company
line
here,
not
a
lessee
of
the
bus
company
or
not
a
lessee
of
the
terminal
company
were
operating
these
restaurants,
they
will
not
only
own
the
transport
here,
but
we
will
as
a
related
function
provide
a
place
to
eat.
we
will
not
do
in
some
bus
companies
do.
we
will
just
let
you
off
and
give
you
time
to
seek
your
meal
somewhere
else
as
some,
they
didn't.
but
we
will
--
we
will
provide
it
ourselves
and
if
the
bus
company,
the
carrier
that
is
operating
is
subject
to
regulation
under
the
act
did
that,
then,
i
think
it
has
to
provide
it
without
any
discrimination
in
giving
the
service
to
its
patrons.
and
i
think
that
if
the
bus
company
were
operating
this
restaurant
and
the
man
came
in
to
get
a
service
which
regards
to
whether
the
manager
told
him
to
get
out,
and
he
had
a
right
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
to
be
there,
then
you
couldn't
bring
in
by
your
state
statute,
it
wouldn't
be
trespass
because
he
would
be
lawfully
there.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
i
think
we
could.
i
think
the
--
if
it
is
not
a
service
which
is
required
in
the
interstate
â€“-
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
if
it
is
not
a
service
which
is
required
by
the
act
or
by
the
commission
passing
an
appropriate
regulation,
but
the
company
of
its
own
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
it
isn't
required
as
far
as
interstate
commerce
is
concerned.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
we
have
to
have
the
responsibility
there
first.
it
is
not
avoiding
responsibility
because
the
bus
company
may
decide
to
erect
an
office
building
in
the
city
of
richmond
and
have
on
the
ground
floor
its
terminal.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
don't
know
if
that
is
--
that
would've
been
construed
here
to
mean
that
a
bus
company
has
to
go
into
the
restaurant
business.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
not
if
it
not
be
a
transportation
matter.
if
it
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
eating
may
be,
but
in
many
cases,
a
person
will
bring
their
buses
to
towns
with
no
eating
facility.
they
stop
because
eating
is
necessary
and
they
go
across
the
street
to
howard
johnson
or
to
some
other
restaurant
and
eat
a
particular
food
and
they
get
back
on.
it's
not
essential
as
far
as
the
way
the
buses
operate,
that
is
a
distinction
between
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
i
would
certainly
think
that
if
they
didn't
have
to
set
up
the
terminal,
they
have
terminal
(inaudible),
some
place
that
they
don't
have
a
terminal.
and
they
don't
set
it
up
and
then
suppose
somebody
comes
along
and
said,
let's
do
it
anyway.
let's
do
it
anyway.
let's
set
up
the
terminal
anyway.
the
terminal
is
built.
i'll
set
it
up,
or
you
the
bus
company
set
it
up
and
lease
it.
if
it
were
not
an
essential
closely
related
function
to
interstate
commerce,
then
the
action
of
that
private
concern
would
not
be
there
i
think
with
the
carrier.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
would
say
it
is
--
it
is
related,
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
certainly
on
a
long
bus
trip,
you
got
to
eat
three
times
a
day.
i
think
we
would
consider
that
and
that
you
would
--
during
your
passage
you
would
certainly
expect
the
bus
company
to
at
least
stop,
give
you
an
opportunity
to
eat.
then,
the
bus
company
may
set
up
a
restaurant
to
--
to
feed
and
it
--
it
is
in
that
sense
closely
related
to
demonstrate
commerce,
it
maybe
a
function
that
they
don't
have
to
perform
and
i
make
that
--
that
is
a
distinction
i
am
making.
it
is
--
if
it
is
one
that
isn't
required
if
they
then,
when
they
engaged
in
that
part,
then,
the
private
operator
can
do
as
he
pleases.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
if
the
bus
company
did
it?
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes
and
it
is
--
i
mean,
i'm
doubt
about
it
if
the
bus
company
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
think
of
course
he's
got
a
matter
of
degree.
he
said
if
he
could
come
to
a
(inaudible)
where
they're
setting
the
--
they
could
say,
provide
this
building,
provide
the
stalls,
provide
all
of
the
plates
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
and
hire
in
the
agents
that
you're
running
of.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
don't
believe
they
went
that
far
they
could,
no.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
you're
obviously
getting
much
closer.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
they
may
have
your
honor
and
other
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
of
course
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
that's
true.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
sir.
they
do
have
certain
elements
of
control
as
far
as
this
equipment
and
as
far
as
in
some
place
it
can
be
so.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
view
of
it
your
honor.
it
certainly
is.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
he
did.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
--
either
from
(inaudible).
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
if
you
assume
that
the
bus
company
(inaudible)
one
and
the
same,
the
bus
company
made
this
lease,
instead
of
the
terminal,
then
you
have
the
question
that
you're
speaking
of
here.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
no,
no
power
it
has
once
it
gets
a
record
had
been
made
up.
and
it
comes
to
it
on
evidence
that's
been
heard
by
the
trial
court
and
it
passes
on
that
evidence
as
a
reviewing
court.
then
if
the
man
didn't
kill
the
individual
involved,
it's
discovered
later
it
did
--
his
remedy
is
independent
so
far
as
i
am
aware
one
of
the
executive
premises
not
of
judicial
review
at
the
appellate
level.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
no,
i
have
not
said
that.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
know
of
no
trial
as
in
the
court
has.
in
fact,
i'm
satisfied
it
does
not
(inaudible)
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that's
true.
they
--
the
access
of
reviewing
court
to
consider
the
record
as
it
comes
to
that.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
no,
on
that
--
that's
right.
the
question
has
been
presented
at
all.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
the
one
year
(inaudible)
that
i
can
mention
to
the
court
is
the
case
of
(inaudible)
i
believe
against
somebody.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
there
would
be
brought
because
i
think
the
--
there
maybe
other
section
dealing
with
the
criminal
appeals
so
that
is
the
title
of
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
if
i
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
both
provisions,
yes,
the
same
type
of
thing
that
was
involved
in
the
maine
case
where
the
question
of
possible
consideration
of
other
elements
and
the
court
held
that
it
had
no
power
to
remand
the
case
at
that
stage
of
the
proceeding
for
the
taking
of
additional
evidence.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
if
they
have
the
evidence
in
the
record
before
them,
yes,
but
if
it
is
not
--
if
it's
not
on
that
it's
presented,
it
holds
the
record.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
well,
of
course,
we
have
the
rule
in
virginia
of
after
discovery
and
evidence
that
this
governed
by
time
limitations
and
things
of
that
sort
but
it
would
not
be
available
after
the
case
has
got
to
the
--
got
to
the
appellate
level.
and
the
rules
relating
to
that
must
be
evidence
it
wasn't
available
at
the
time.
and
in
no
way
of
anybody
presenting
it
at
that
time,
a
person
can
make
certain
motions
in
the
trial
court,
the
trier
of
facts
can
order
a
new
trial
on
the
grounds
of
after
the
discover
and
evidence
following
the
crowd
before
that
court
loses
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
but
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
is
it.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
that
can
be
presented
to
the
supreme
court
or
remand.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
there
are
provisions
for
applying
the
writ
of
coram
nobis
in
virginia
and
--
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
i
think
there
are
some
situations
in
which
under
certain
rules,
that
procedure
is
available.
frankly,
i'm
not
first
on
that
point
right
here
now
but
i
--
i
do
know
of
the
procedure
and
i
do
know
that
in
some
case,
it
has
been
used
and
i
think
it
is
in
some
situation
have
been
applied
in
the
case
of
after
discovered
evidence.
so
just
put
the
second
part
that
i'm
unable
to
advise
the
court
at
this
time.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
yes,
i
do
have,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
are
number
of
restaurants
in
virginia
that
have
desegregated
their
facilities
in
a
matter
of
recent
months.
and
in
fact,
this
particular
restaurant
is
one
that
has
--
that
goes
of
course
to
the
question
of
the
virginia
statute
that
is
involved
here
being
--
it
is
not
a
segregation
statute
at
all.
there
is
no
compulsion
on
the
part
of
the
state.
there
is
no
effort
being
made
in
virginia
and
introduced
places
who
have
voluntarily
chosen
the
course
of
desegregation
to
make
them
change
their
policies
and
the
police
don't
come
in
and
try
to
seize
if
any
action
is
enforced.
it's
a
matter
that
is
left
on
this
score
to
the
individual
action
by
--
and
that
he
says
i
will
serve
both
for
these
to
do
so.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
be
in
the
policy
of
separation
and
during
at
that
way,
then
if
he
enforces
that,
then,
in
those
cases,
by
doing
the
crime
in
which
the
statute
is
both
but
not
as
a
matter
of
state
policy.
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
haven't
touched
on
all
phases
of
this
review
with
the
matters
that
are
covered
by
the
brief.
i
think
that
the
counsel
for
the
opposition
of
--
i
give
too
much
consideration
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
but
we
think
it's
controlled
by
the
reason
on
this
lower
court
level
in
maryland
decision.
and
if
that
very
issue
was
involved
and
by
this
action
in
paul
against
virginia
involving
this
very
statute
that
was
considered
by
the
court
there
and
its
rulings
of
--
on
that
in
refusing
to
consider
the
case.
i
want
to
call
your
attention
to
one
typographical
error
on
page
16
of
our
brief.
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
line
the
word
"eventuary"
should
be
"evidentiary,"
evidence.
mr.
walter
e.
rogers
16,
the
fourth
line,
the
last
word.
that
should
be
evidentiary,
not
eventuary.
