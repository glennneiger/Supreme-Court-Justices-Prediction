by
these
opponents
by
section
of

i
take
you
that
in
this
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words
you
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
owner
of
a
transportation
(inaudible)
is
not
denied
and
its
focused
by
(inaudible)
for
the
restaurant
for
one
purpose
independently

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now,
by
--
by
anybody.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
it's
all
public
bus
terminals.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
should
be
ignored
to
try
and
denied
section
of
the
facilities
if

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
are
they
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
in
the
(inaudible)
who
has
lease
the
portion
of
the
premises
doing
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
think
there
must
be
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
that
the
bus
terminal
has
to
be
bus
company?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
--
that
there
is
a
bus
that
may
not
be
reflection
of
the
(inaudible)
in
the
district
operation
(inaudible)
by
the
purposes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
it's
non-delegable
as
in
the
sinclair
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
presume
this
may
be
(inaudible)
the
bus
company
or
the
carrier
because
insofar,
this
(inaudible)
may
i
ask
you
this,
the
day
the
bus
company
(inaudible)
the
question
of
the
breach
should
not
do
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
breaching.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
which?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
is
this
unlawfully
made
a
contract
of
(inaudible)
a
portion
of
the
premises
to
somebody
to
do
any
property
of
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you're
talking
about
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
of
course
that's
a
different
proposition
that
i
have
in
mind.
i
have
in
mind
that
this
brief
(inaudible)
to
me
that
happens
to
be
under
your
(inaudible)
and
i
then
have
the
right
i
should
think
to
do
this
in
my
state
to
the
exclusion
of
the
landlord
for
any
lawful
person.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i
could
understand.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
deny
that
it
was
within
the
power
of
the
commission
by
regulation
to
require
the
bus
company
to
personally
operate
such
a
--
an
eating
facility
at
every
terminal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
i
understand
it's
your
argument
but
that
has
not
been
done.
i
wondered
if
you
care
to
comment
on
whether
it
could
be.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
used
the
word
agency
in
the
type
that
it
would
have
to
be
the
bus
company's
own
facility.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
non-delegable.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
is
true
in
every
situation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
at
the
time
when
every
trespasser
would
leave
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
on
break
time
when
every
trespasser
would
have
to
leave.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
you
have
a
(inaudible)
a
long-term
lease
that
didn't
have
that
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
have?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
isn't
to
come
everyday
(inaudible)
long-term
lease.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
the
power
of
all
the
ordinances
of
this
facility
in
laws
of
the
state?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
united
states.
