mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
commonwealth
of
virginia,
which,
in
turn,
had
denied
petition
for
writ
of
error,
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
hustings
court
of
richmond,
virginia.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
rather
simple
and
not
in
dispute.
on
december
20,
1958,
petitioner,
a
negro
law
student
from
howard
university
here
in
washington
was
en
route
home
to
selma,
alabama
on
his
christmas
vacation.
he
boarded
the
trailway
bus
here
in
washington,
d.c.
and
en
route
to
selma,
alabama
the
bus
made
a
routine
stop
at
approximately
10:40
p.m.
in
richmond,
virginia.
the
bus
drove
up,
the
trailways
bus,
drove
up
to
the
trailways
bus
terminal
in
richmond
and
announced
that
there
would
be
a
40-minute
layoff.
the
petitioner
being
hungry
and
anxious
to
eat
before
reboarding,
he
went
into
the
terminal.
there
were
two
restaurants
there.
one
marked
for
white
persons
and
one
for
colored.
the
petitioner
testified
that
the
colored
restaurant
appeared
to
be
crowded.
now,
here
the
commonwealth
disputes
that
because
the
testimony
of
the
assistant
manager
was
that
at
some
time
after
when
this
whole
incident
was
going
along,
he
noticed
that
it
was
not
crowded.
so
the
question
that
i
submit
is,
i
think
we
will
show
later
as
immaterial
anyhow.
the
petitioner
testified
that
after
he
noticed,
it
appeared
to
him
that
this
negro
place
was
crowded,
he
proceeded
to
the
other
restaurant,
which
was
not
crowded,
and
there's
no
dispute
on
that,
the
other
was
not
crowded
and
he
took
one
of
the
vacant
stools,
sat
down,
and
one
of
the
waitresses
approached
him
and
told
him
that
he
should
go
over
to
the
other
restaurant
and
the
petitioner
told
her
that
the
facilities
in
other
restaurant
appeared
to
be
crowded.
he
was
an
interstate
commerce
passenger
and
that
he
should
be
served
in
restaurant
--
this
restaurant.
after
some
discussion,
the
waitress
suggested
that
he
purchase
a
prepared
sandwich.
he
therefore
ordered
one
of
these
prepared
sandwiches
and
a
cup
of
tea.
the
waitress
returned
to
him
and
said,
she
couldn't
serve
him
and
she
had
orders
not
to
serve
him.
he
explained
again
that
he
was
an
interstate
passenger
and
should
be
served.
the
waitress
went
away
again
and
this
time
she
came
back
with
assistant
manager
who
later
testified
and
hearing
the
petitioner
testified,
he
showed
the
assistant
manager
his
ticket
that
he
had
a
right
to
eat
there.
the
manager
asked
him
to
move
out.
there's
no
question
all
along
in
this
that
the
whole
basis
of
asking
him
to
move
and
the
whole
basis
of
refusing
to
serve
him
in
this
restaurant
was
because
of
his
race.
at
this
stage,
the
manager
went
out
and
returned
with
a
policeman.
then
there's
some
conflict
between
the
testimony
of
the
assistant
manager
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
to
exactly
what
happened.
that
is
whether
the
petitioner
went
out
and
came
back
or
whether
the
manager
went
out
with
a
policeman,
but
it's
significant
that
the
manager's
testimony
says
that
he
reported
to
the
policeman
at
that
point
the
petitioner
was
creating
a
disturbance.
the
policeman
came
in,
there's
no
question
about
that.
that
the
policeman
entered
in
--
entered
into
the
discussion,
trying
to
persuade
the
petitioner
to
move
over
to
the
other
restaurant
and
i
emphasize
this
because
later
on
in
this
argument,
we
hope
to
get
to
the
question
of
state
action.
the
state
action
moves
in
at
this
point
that
the
assistant
manager
and
the
police
are
jointly
trying
to
persuade
petitioner
to
be
segregated.
and
the
petitioner
says,
he
has
a
right
to
eat
there
and
he
wants
to
eat
there.
the
policeman
then
asked
the
manager,
“do
you
want
him
arrested?
do
you
want
to
get
a
warrant
for
him?”
the
manager
says,
“not
unless
he
refuses
to
go.”
then
he
did
get
the
warrant
and
got
--
the
manager
straight
got
the
warrant
and
the
petitioner
was
arrested
and
put
in
jail.
the
warrant
--
the
original
trial
was
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
trespasser,
but
you'll
notice
in
the
record
that
this
trespass
allegation
was
immediately
amended
to
provide
that
it
was
one
of
these
trespass
cases
where
he
refused
to
move
after
being
told.
and
the
statute
which
we
set
forth
on
page
four
of
our
brief,
the
one
under
which
boynton
was
convicted,
is
if
any
person
shall
without
authority
of
law
go
upon
or
remain
upon
the
lands
or
premises
of
another
after
having
been
forbidden
to
do
so
by
the
owner's,
let's
say
custodian
or
other
person
lawfully
in-charge
of
such
land,
or
having
been
forbidden
to
do
so
by
a
sign
or
sign
posted
on
the
premises
at
a
place
or
places
where
they
maybe
reasonably
seen,
he
shall
be
deemed
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
and
upon
conviction
there
to
be
punished
by
a
fine
of
not
more
than
$100
or
by
confinement
in
jail
not
exceeding
30
days
or
both.
and
it's
a
theory
of
the
prosecution
in
this
case
that
he
was
guilty
of
violating
this
statute
because
in
fact
he
didn't
move
when
first
asked
to
be
moved.
now,
as
i
see
it
the
facts
in
this
case
add
up
to
this.
there
was
no
dispute
that
the
petitioner
was
an
interstate
passenger.
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
ticket
was
tendered
in
the
court
and
that
he
not
only
was
an
interstate
passenger,
but
he
was
actually
in
passage
between
washington
and
selma,
alabama.
this
was
an
interrupted
passage.
the
bus
--
the
trailways
bus
stopped
at
the
trailways
bus
terminal
and
all
of
this
were
on
the
property
of
the
trailways
bus
terminal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
the
bus
company
--
the
restaurant
was
owned
and
operated
by
the
restaurant
company
under
a
lease
from
the
trailways
bus
terminal.
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
do
not
claim
that
on
the
facts
that
are
in
the
record,
i
do
not
claim
that
the
bus
company
owned
the
restaurant
or
controlled
it
as
such.
but
this
court
when
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
requested
the
state
of
virginia
to
furnish
whatever
evidence
they
had
and
it's
whether
or
not
judicial
notice
could
be
taken
to
the
fact.
and
the
commonwealth
replied
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
documents
which
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
should
take
cognisance
of.
however,
the
united
states,
as
amicus
curiae,
has
produced
to
this
court,
the
documents
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
do
show
that
control.
i
admit
quite
frankly
that
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
it's
not
there,
but
so
far
as
the
present
posture
of
this
case
is
concerned,
it
is
there
because
it's
certainly
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states
and
if
there
is
any
dispute
as
to
it,
you
have
it
in
here
representing
the
commonwealth
today
not
only
the
assistant
attorney
general,
but
also
the
lawyer
from
the
restaurant
and
he
knows
who
controls
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
body
--
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
it's
the
report
--
the
regular
report
was
acquired
by
law
to
be
made
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
a
certified
copy
of
that
is
there.
i
don't,
at
this
stage
and
to
this
point
i
don't
rely
on
the
brief.
i
rely
on
that
which
is
a
regular
report
filed
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
shows
that
the
trailways
bus
company
owns
50%
of
the
share.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir,
i
certainly
do
not
take
that
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
the
court
has
difficulty
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
under
the,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
lilly
case,
lilly
versus
grand
trunk,
which
was
the
one
where
this
court
took
notice,
despite
the
fact
that
the
lower
courts
have
not,
of
icc
regulation
but
it
was
a
regulation
and
it's
a
lot
different
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
it's
entirely
different.
i
take
the
position
sir
that
as
the
--
obviously
from
the
lawyers
of
the
petitioner,
and
i
would've
been
in
an
agreement
with
them,
it
was
their
theory
that
this
case
was
governed
more
by
the
morgan
case
and
under
the
theory
of
the
morgan
case,
which
i
will
get
to,
it's
not
necessary
to
show
that
the
carrier
actually
controls.
the
difference
as
i
see
it
is
that
under
the
commerce
clause
itself,
we
would
not
be
obliged
to
show
that
the
carrier
actually
controlled
the
restaurant,
if
in
fact
the
restaurant
can
be
shown
to
interfere
with
the
flow
of
commerce.
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
particularly
the
motor
carriers
division,
it
does
limit
into
a
terminal
that
is
controlled
by
the
carrier,
but
i
see
not
too
much
difference
between
the
argument
which
we
could
make
for
the
clause
or
the
act
for
this
reason.
i
don't
believe
that
congress,
in
saying
specifically
that
we
will
legislate
on
terminals
controlled
by
the
--
or
carrier,
meant
to
exclude
all
other
terminals.
for
example
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir
and
i
think
i
have
to
do
that
before
i
get
to
the
clause,
because
i
want
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
as
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
act
will
only
take
care
of
me
sir
if
we
have
this
other
document
in
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
need
the
document
for
the
purpose
of
the
clause
if
--
if
i
may
just
a
moment.
i
first
have
to
show
for
the
commerce
clause
that
either
congress
is
legislated
and
i
worked
with
the
legislation
or
that
congress
is
not
legislative.
in
the
morgan
case,
this
court
held
that
congress
is
not
legislating
on
the
question
of
separation
of
the
races
by
the
carrier,
and
then
that
there
should
be
a
national
policy
or
uniformity.
and
on
this
case,
the
argument
as
made
by
the
other
side
is
that
since
this
is
the
motor
carrier
act
said
that
terminals
controlled
by
the
carrier
are
covered
that
they
meant
to
exclude
other
--
all
other
terminals,
and
if
their
position
is
right,
then
i
have
difficulty
with
the
--
with
getting
under
the
clause.
but
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
at
this
stage
is
that
i
don't
believe
congress
intended,
because
here's
what
you
would
have
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
i
don't
think
congress
did,
because
you
take
in
a
town
like
richmond,
virginia
where
this
occurred,
assuming
there
were
two
identical
bus
terminals,
one
owned
by
--
one
owned
by
trailway
bus
and
one
with
no
control,
but
used
solely
by
grayhound
bus
company
with
identical
facilities,
i
don't
think
congress
meant
that
one
was
controlled
and
the
other
was
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
--
it's
said
that
specifically
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
only
--
it's
in
the
concluding
paragraph
where
the
mere
statement
is
made
--
but
if
you
give
me
just
a
moment
may
it
please
the
court,
it's
spelled
here.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
in
morgan
there
was
the
--
the
act
was
not
involved
in
the
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
abandoned
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
let's
spell
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
what
the
--
the
concluding
paragraph
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
only
reason
i'm
arguing
the
commerce
clause.
i
would
prefer
to
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
i
--
i
--
the
--
the
only
reason
i
was
arguing
the
statute
was
because
if
the
statute
covers
it
i
can't
argue
the
board
clause.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
reason
we
abandoned
it
was
that
at
the
time
of
petition
for
certiorari
we
had
a
record
and
we
realized
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
which
shows
the
nexus
between
the
terminal
and
the
carrier.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
is
there
yet?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
between
the
restaurant
and
the
carrier
in
the
record
it
is
not
there.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
shows
that
the
carrier
owns
50%
of
the
terminal
which
leases
to
the
restaurant
with
the
controlled
lease
which
is
in
the
record.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
says
for
example
that
you,
they
regulate
everything
in
there
that
any
body
could
possibly
regulate.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
--
it
might
be
an
ordinary
common
type
of
lease
for
a
bus
terminal,
but
the
lease
as
specifically
on
page
14
that
it
must
be
maintained
and
an
up
to
date
modern
bus
terminal
type.
and
then
it
says
a
little
low,
neither
the
lessee
nor
its
point
should
be
allowed
to
perform
any
terminal
service.
this
is
a
terminal
bus
restaurant
lease.
it
is
not
the
run
of
the
mill
lease
that
you
give
for
an
ordinary
restaurant
in
town.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
have
a
very
different
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir
because
the
restaurant
across
the
street
would
not
be
in
the
flow
of
commerce.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
it
could
be.
but
that
it
could
not
be
open
to
the
public.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
of
whether
(inaudible)
would
be
considered
as
normal
in
interstate
commerce
but
eating
is.
i
think
sir
that
the
important
thing
is
that
eating
is
a
normal
result
of
interstate
transportation
and
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
such,
but
by
enclose
it
would
not
be.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
think
possibly
he
could,
but
my
point
is
not
that
the
terminal
alone.
my
point
which
i
was
trying
to
get
to
on
this,
on
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
question,
is
that
if
this
restaurant
is
set
up
for
the
purpose
of
serving
food
to
interstate
passengers
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
by
anybody.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir
and
if
--
if
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
facility
to
facilitate
the
flow
of
commerce
then
it
cannot
escape
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
the
restaurant
across
the
street
is
not
for
that
purpose
and
i
submit
that
in
this
case,
it's
quite
obvious
why
they're
on
the
bus
terminal
is
to
keep
people
from
going
across
the
street
and
being
out
of
hand
and
you
can't
keep
them
there
so
you
--
they'll
be
there
to
board
in
the
bus
too.
so,
if
they
go
across
the
street
and
something
happens
to
them,
there's
a
possibility
of
suit
for
injury
and
they
have
set
this
up
as
a
--
this
is
the
trailways
bus
terminal,
it's
not
the
trailways
shopping
center
or
the
trailways
restaurant,
it's
a
bus
terminal
and
i
submit
that
in
that
bus
terminal,
that
restaurant
is
on
the
same
basis
as
the
restrooms,
the
waiting
rooms,
the
ticket
window.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
that
if
the
--
there
is
a
bus
terminal
which
has
all
of
these
facilities
then
in
addition,
it
has
something
else
possibly,
i
don't
know.
but
if
it
--
if
it's
not
intended
to
be
in
commerce,
because
in
this
case
we've
got
a
facility
that's
intended
if
the
bus
company,
if
the
trailway
bus
company
served
sandwiches
on
that
bus
they
could
not
segregate
point
while
he
ate,
so
they
stopped
to
give
him
sandwiches,
they
can't
segregate.
that's
true.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
petitioner
got
on
the
bus
in
washington
and
he
did
what
congress
has
recognized,
he
began
on
what
he
expected
to
be
a
normal
uninterrupted
journey
without
discrimination.
the
bus
company
dropped
him
at
this
bus
terminal,
he
didn't
walk
in
that,
the
bus
company
put
in
there,
and
the
bus
company
put
him
in
there
and
that
bus
terminal
is
in
just
as
much
interstate
commerce
of
the
bus.
the
only
difference
is
that
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
just
--
right
there,
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
the
bus
company
saying
“we'll
serve
you
on
the
bus
or
off
the
bus”.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
say
that
the
bus
terminal
--
it's
not
the
name
of
it
is
such,
but
it's
what
it
actually
does.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
this
sets
its
--
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
mr.
chief
justice
the
--
the
lease
is
between
the
restaurant
and
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
bus
terminal
company.
and
that
for
several
pages
itemized
everything
it
can't
go
out
and
serve
people
on
the
bus,
you
can't
do
this,
you
can't
do
if
--
it's
all
obviously
geared
around
service
to
the
interstate
passenger.
the
fact
that
it
incidentally
serves
local
people
is
unimportant
that
the
primary
purpose
is
all
i
think.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
any
question
about
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
absolutely
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
bus
terminal
if
controlled
by
the
carrier
it's
--
it's
under
the
motor
carrier
act.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
lease?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
--
well
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
has
a
connection.
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
company.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
--
yes
sir.
it's
not
only
the
lease,
but
there
is
a
testimony
that
this
is
the
type
of
terminal
which
has
a
normal
service.
it's
the
only
company
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
there's
no
question
that
the
purpose
of
this
bus
terminal
was
to
keep
this
from
being
just
an
ordinary
stop
that
this
is
a
bus
terminal
with
all
of
the
facilities
normal
to
a
carrier
that
does
not
have
the
facility
which
he
could
have
on
this
carrier.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
under
the
motor
carriers
act
the
--
the
point
would
be
that
the
act
as
to
terminals
has
that
provision
controlled
by,
you
would
have
to
find
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record
it's
obvious
that
the
bus
terminal
was
controlled
by
the
bus
company.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
the
court
could
do
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
the
fact
that
the
bus
company
--
i
--
i
couldn't
conceive
of
a
bus
company
driving,
buses
and
there
exclusive
stop
and
not
having
some
control
on
it.
i
mean
it's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
the
transportation
world
on
a
trip
from
washington,
d.c.
to
salem,
alabama
it
certainly
that
there
are
certain
things
that
the
passengers
have
to
do
and
one
of
these
is
they
have
to
eat.
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
plus
one
other
thing,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
there
is
language
in
the
brief
on
the
motor
carrier
act
which
says
that
these
services
that
they
must
furnish
these
carriers
and
this
--
this
carrier
is
furnishing
that
service
and
he
is
furnishing
at
this
bus
terminal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
plus
if,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
bear
in
mind
that
on
this
trip
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
government‘s
brief.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
--
it
starts
on
page
5
in
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
it
may
have
a
reference
to
it.
in
the
performance
of
any,
it's
on
the
bottom
of
page
seven
and
runs
along.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
but
the
other
point
that
i
think
is
even
more
important
is
the
--
this
point
about
not
having
this
information
of
the
connection
of
the
bus
terminal
and
the
bus
company
even
though
boyton
was
a
law
school
student,
but
if
that's
true
each
place
the
trade
of
the
--
the
bus
stops,
he's
got
to
have
the
armed
with
the
corporate
papers
to
find
out
who
owns
the
bus
terminal
and
that's
only
way
he
can
find
out
what
his
rights
are.
and
incidentally,
when
we
got
copies
of
it,
it
cost
us
around
$70
which
is
four
times
his
bus
traffic,
but
just
as
in
the
morgan
case,
there
are
two
things
involved.
he
goes
to
the
terminal
in
--
in
richmond
which
is
actually
owned
by
the
bus
company.
so,
he
would
have
a
right
to
nonsegregated
service
under
the
commonwealth's
position.
then
he
stops
in
another
town,
in
another
state.
that
bus
company
does
not
own
the
bus
terminal.
when
he
goes
in
there,
and
he's
legally
arrested
and
he
goes
another
place
he
can
have
four
convictions
by
the
time
he
gets
through
with
his
journey.
two
of
them
would
be
sustained
and
two
of
them
would
be
thrown
out
and
that
is
the
opposite
of
congress'
purpose
in
the
flowing
of
--
of
commerce
and
i
don't
think
anybody
can
dispute
that.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
know
it's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
we
have
one
interesting
distinguishing
point.
the
restaurant
was
based
on
the
fact
that
the
restaurant
could
not
have
been
essential
to
interstate
commerce
because
it
had
previously
been
closed
for
some
40
years
or
(inaudible).
that
was
the
basis
of
the
restaurant,
but
difference
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
the
interesting
thing
is
that
the
record
shows
in
this
case
that
the
restaurant
was
built
simultaneously
with
the
terminal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
in
that
--
that
is
my
basic
point.
i
--
i
frankly
didn't
agree
with
any
of
the
reasoning
on
that
particular
point,
but
that
seem
to
me
to
be
underlying.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
--
i
say
quite
frankly,
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
think
so
and
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
the
interstate
commerce
commission
i
would
be
willing
to
agree
that
they
did
say
that
and
i
--
i
submit
that
they're
wrong.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
railroad
trains
with
dining
cars.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
with
dining
cars.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
he
said
it
wasn't
essential.
it
was
not
essential
on
restaurant
in
a
terminal
was
not
essential
to
transportation
--
to
the
train
transportation.
but
i
submit
that
a
restaurant
in
a
bus
terminal
for
a
--
a
24-hour
trip
at
least
speak
for
myself
eating
would
be
essential.
in
the
dining
in
a
train,
i
can
eat
in
the
dining
car,
or
i
could
get
a
sandwich
from
the
newsstand
what
have
you
been
on
--
on
the
bus.
your
only
place
is
in
the
terminal
and
i
think
that
that's
the
difference.
in
fact,
i
don't
want
to
say
i
agree
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
point
on
argument.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
think
that
that's
it
but
i
--
i
still
think
the
underlying
factor
was
that
it
has
been
closed.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
have
to
get
to
that
but
i
--
because
mr.
justice
frankfurter
my
point
is
that
if
they
furnish,
it's
whether
if
you
have
to
or
not,
but
if
they
furnish
it
as
an
essential
service
then
they
have
to
do
it
without
regard
to
race
and
color.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
except
for
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
except
on
the
anderson
they
can
do
it
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
the
anderson
case
they
can't
do
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
my
point
was
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
that,
i
--
i
just
have
great
difficulty
seeing
the
difference
between
a
--
the
end
of
the
bus
being
set
up
as
a
small
table
dining
car
then
i
think
the
anderson
case
is
right
there
--
right
--
right
on
the
nub.
well,
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
the
bus
companies
dropping
you
out
of
place
where
they
are
at
the
same
table.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
they
gave
him
a
blue
check
stub
so
that
throughout
the
trip
they
would
know
that
he
was
an
interstate
passenger
on
that
bus.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
think
there
--
mr.
justice
stewart
we
--
we
get
into
the
matter
of
degree.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
there's
no
question
of
the
duty
of
the
bus
company
to
see
to
it
that
he
is
put
in
a
safe
place
etcetera,
etcetera,
etcetera,
but
on
the
other
hand
as
to
the
joining
to
a
little
small
place
at
the
--
at
the
gas
station
and
incidentally
has
a
little
sandwich
counter,
as
to
whether
that
sandwich
counter
is
in
the
same
position
as
the
--
the
richmond
terminal
bus
and
all
those
things
aside
but
obviously
not.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
i
--
i
don't
agree.
i
think
that
this
restaurant
was
set
up
for
the
purpose
of
serving
passengers
of
the
trailways
bus
company.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
lease
says
it
must
be
maintained
as
an
adequate
bus
terminal
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
wasn't
trying
to
assume
that
i
was
--
i
was
trying
to
talk
about
the
difference
in
the
two
places.
the
--
the
little
place
side
on
the
road
that
is
a
gas
station
with
a
lunch
counter,
it's
primarily
a
gas
station
to
serve
local
people.
this
one
is
primarily
to
serve
interstate
commerce,
and
because
it's
set
up
for
that
purpose.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
--
if
that
is
true,
then
my
argument
would
apply
to
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
but
it
would
not
apply
to
a
place
that
just
incidentally
had
one
bus
stop
by
every
other
day.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
are
more
than
few
that
was
left,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
there's
still
a
part
few
left
this
witness
[laughter]
--
as
the
witness
of
fact
that
this
terminal
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
these
terminals
are
being
built
all
up
and
down
the
road
and
i
--
i
think
the
--
there's
a
need
to
show
that
this
has
been
gone,
and
i
think
it's
the
bus
company's
duty
to
see
to
it
that
this
man's
trip
is
not
interrupted.
and
here
we
have
the
bus
company
put
him
in
the
place
where
he
ended
up,
not
just
interrupt
him,
he
ended
up
in
jail
with
the
full
panoply
of
the
state
government
on
it.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
in
virginia
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh
no.
no,
no
sir.
no
sir,
its
--
its
way
back
as
i
remember
a
research
of
the
codification
of
the
--
the
oldest.
it's
at
--
it's
not
out
of
the
ordinary
statute.
i
think
that
since
i
--
i
was
trying
to
save
some
time,
i
would
like
to
say
that
while
i
agree
fully
and
i
--
i
consider
it
my
duty
to
argue
to
this
court
the
points
that
could
decide
in
this
case
without
getting
to
the
constitutional
question,
we
still
have
brief
and
we
are
prepared
to
argue
it
that
if
those
points
are
not
being
sufficient,
we
are
also
relying
upon
the
fact
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
get
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
all.
it
merely
says
that
if
necessary,
we
still
think
that
the
refusal
to
serve
boynton
be
put
aside
that
the
action
of
the
state
government
in
arresting
him
not
for
trespass,
not
for
refusal
to
leave,
but
with
the
full
knowledge
of
the
police
and
the
magistrate
that
the
sole
reason
for
his
refusal
to
move
was
that
--
i
mean
the
sole
reason
for
the
request
for
him
to
move
was
race
or
color
that
we
do
have
sufficient
state
action
and
we
rely
on
our
notes
in
our
brief
on
shelly
and
kramer
(inaudible)
jackson
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
alright.
the
--
there
are
services
that
said
that
where
the
services
are
offered,
they
must
be
offered
alike.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
it's
almost
the
same
as
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
introduced
but
it
--
but
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no
sir.
i
said
it's
in
the
motor
carrier
act.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no
sir.
i'm
sorry,
maybe
i
did.
i
--
i
said,
the
motor
carrier
act
provides
that
when
services
are
rendered
they
must
be
rendered
indiscriminatorily
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
--
oh,
yes
there
is
no
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that's
not
the
point.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
i
think
that
that's
correct
and
i
think
we
take
the
position
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
we
take
the
position
that
once
these
services
are
offered
one
way
or
the
other,
they've
got
to
be
--
there's
no
question
after
the
starting
with
the
mitchell
case
on
down
to
the
present,
there's
no
question
about
that,
it
seems
to
me
and
the
decision
to
this
court.
now,
they
--
the
--
the
commonwealth
is
trying
to
say
that
this
is
a
little
private
institution.
well,
we
take
the
position
that
it's
not,
it's
actually
in
interstate
commerce
and
we
make
our
position
clear.
we
believe
that
under
the
commerce
clause,
the
action
in
refusing
to
serve
in
and
in
fact
having
him
arrested,
leaving
just
one
point
that
he
was
only
there
for
40
minutes
when
they
refused
to
serve
him
and
he'd
said,
"well
i'm
going
to
insist
on
it,"
they
could've
waited
40
minutes
and
let
him
get
on
his
bus,
but
they
didn't,
they
had
him
arrested.
and
therefore
integrated
with
the
flow
of
commerce
at
least
insofar
as
boynton
was
concerned.
and
on
that
basis
we
think
that
not
only
as
it's
an
interference
with
commerce
under
the
commerce
clause,
we
also
take
the
position
that
if
necessary,
if
the
court
finds
that
it
has
to
get
to
the
point
that
we
think
it's
a
violation
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
in
--
in
most
instances
in
most
states,
i
think
the
procedure
there
would
be
the
same
to
fact
to
the
state
court
of
virginia.
i
know
there's
no
way
for
--
for
virginia
to
do
it.
this
--
that's
what
i
--
as
i
read
the
virginia.
they
say
it's
the
way
to
the
new
york
case.
but
i
--
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
mr.
justice
black,
that
i
don't
--
while
i
admit
that
for
technical
reasons
the
interstate
commerce
act
might
be
held
not
to
apply
because
of
the
lack
of
this
piece
of
evidence,
i
don't
take
the
position
that
he
cannot,
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
say
emphatically,
that
this
court
can
decide
the
case
under
the
board's
commerce
powers
without
reaching
the
act
as
such.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
our
position.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
say
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
say
that
it's
an
abstract
proposition
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
an
abstract
proposition
signed
to
the
(inaudible),
but
if
they
lease
a
facility
that
is
essential
to
interstate
commerce
which
they
are
operating
on,
they
cannot
escape
the
responsibility
by
doing
it.
no
more
so
than
a
railroad
could
escape
it
by
leasing
its
dining
car
to
somebody
else.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
breaching?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
if
it's
there
duty?
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
shouldn't
be
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
not
if
it's
in
the
bus
terminal
and
it's
the
only
one
there.
you
see,
i
mean
--
i
mean,
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
if
the
facility
that
they
lease
is
the
one
facility
of
that
kind
that
is
needed
for
--
to
facilitate
interstate
commerce
which
they
have
a
duty
or
responsibility,
or
it's
norm,
they
cannot
lease
that
to
a
private
individual
and
get
it
there
for
out
of
this
flow
of
commerce.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
that's
--
that's
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
i
think
sir
that
would
be
true,
but
it
would
not
be
true
if
a
restaurant
that
is
essential
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
interstate
commerce
was
--
yes
sir,
it
was
raised
not
the
act.
the
act
was
raised
in
the
first
--
the
motion
of
dismiss
the
warrant.
it
appears
on
page
six
raised
the
act
as
well
as
the
clause
i
think
and
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well
so
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
evidentially
yes.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it's
--
for
example
it
says
on
page
five
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
more,
no
less.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
the
statute
was
raised
in
one
specifically,
and
then
in
the
assignment
of
errors
on
page
five
it
says
the
court
erred
in
refused
to
dismiss
the
;prosecution
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
apply,
has
applied
on
constituted
attempts
during
that
time.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
there
talking
about.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
says
the
court
erred
in
refusing
to
dismiss
the
prosecution.
they
mean
inadvertent
on
interstate
commerce.
the
motion
to
dismiss
the
warrant
is
on
the
following
page,
it's
on
page
six.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
in
that
one,
they
say
specifically
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
--
it
says,
it
says
that
in
the
violation
of
the
(inaudible)
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
think
when
you
read
the
two
together,
frankly
it
is
rather
broad
language
we
confess
but
i
think
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
--
but
i
think
that
it
--
it
does
covers.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
i
--
i
agree
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like,
if
possible,
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
with
few
moments
i
have
with
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question.
i
think
it
should
also
be
added
that
although
this
public
statement
has
been
made
and
indeed
in
facts,
negroes
are
being
served
in
the
bus
terminal
involved
in
this,
the
signs
are
still
up
and
i
submit
now,
we
really
got
a
situation.
boynton
has
not
only
got
to
find
out
who
owns
that
terminal,
he's
going
to
have
to
find
out
just
what
is
the
whim
of
the
manager
on
the
day
he
gets
there.
because
as
it
appears
with
the
sign
still
up,
and
he
was
served
and
i
assume
that
they
would
serve
today
and
tomorrow
they
should
be
back.
and
i
think
that's
the
other
point
that
i've
been
trying
to
get
clear
about
this
different
system
as
it
moves
along
which
is
the
opposite
of
what
the
congress
intends
in
its
commerce
power
that
it
be
uniform
throughout.
on
the
question
as
to
these
rooms
in
the
restaurant
itself,
i
find
out
from
associate
who
have
tried
this
case
that
the
two
--
it's
--
it's
a
long
one
wall
and
there
is
a
wall
between
the
white
section
and
the
colored
section.
there
is
a
wall
there
with
doors
coming
out.
and
it
--
it's
not
a
temporary
wall
or
what
have
you,
but
for
all
intents
and
purposes
it's
the
same
restaurant
but
for
the
wall
and
here,
we
have
the
same
situation
of
making
somebody
move
from
one
to
the
other.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
say
this
so
that
insofar
as
the
trial
in
the
lower
court,
i
guess
it
was
pretty
fast.
i
think
it
normally
the
--
when
it
is
tried
again
that
--
i
mean,
this
is
the
only
record
we
have
actually
is
the
magistrate
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
by
the
trial
de
novo.
it
was
a
trial
de
novo
but
the
practice
appears
to
be
in
this
record
and
indeed
it
was
done
is
you
put
in
the
transcript
in
the
magistrate's
court.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
that
we
--
we
would've
had
a
better
case
but
this
is
by
agreement
as
i
understand
which
is
that
it's
the
normal
procedure.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
my
argument
say
is
--
is
that
i
agree
fully
with
that
but
i
still
say
we
have
enough
in
this
record
to
come
under
the
morgan
case.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
oh,
yes,
sir.
i
--
under
the
morgan
case,
i
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
that
--
and
from
the
argument
that's
been
made
here
by
mr.
rogers
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
bus
company
put
boynton
in
this
bus
terminal.
they
pulled
up,
they'd
let
him
off
in
the
bus
terminal
and
that
whether
it's
owned
or
operated
by
whomsoever,
it
pleases,
it
is
an
essential
part.
the
only
thing
in
the
bus
terminal
are
the
ticket
counters,
restrooms,
a
waiting
room,
and
the
lunch
counter,
i
mean
the
restaurant
and
certainly,
that
restaurant
is
just
a
significant
part
of
that
is
that,
if
they
have
separate
counters
to
buy
tickets
or
separate
restrooms,
he
wouldn't
have
any
trouble.
i
think
you
had
also
--
while
we're
on
this
lease.
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
paragraph
24
on
page
16
says
because
it
requires
them,
the
restaurant
to
administer
--
to
run
this
building
according
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
any
governmental
agency
having
jurisdiction
thereof,
then
it
says
that
having
down
below,
the
lessor
should
apply
with
the
ordinance
of
the
city
of
richmond
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states
in
the
state
of
virginia.
and
i
would
submit
that
i
think
i
know
what
they
were
driving
at
that
this
was
to
be
a
terminal
restaurant
as
represented
up
in
the
beginning
where
they're
required
to
run
the
terminal
facilities.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
in
texas.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
would
think
so.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
the
united
states
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
and
the
regulations
of
agencies,
yes,
sir.
i've
seen
through
the
record.
and
i
submit
i've
never
seen
--
i
frankly,
the
one
type
of
lease
i
have
never
seen
is
one
which
says
that
you
must
run
a
bus
terminal.
no,
i've
never
seen
one
of
--
this
is
the
first
one
on
the
bus
terminal.
and
i
was
reading
in
relation
to
that
state.
that
was
the
section
i
was
reading
in
the
legislature
because
i
--
i
think
mr.
justice
whittaker,
in
complete
honesty
that
this
is
obviously
a
lease
that
has
a
combination.
it
looks
to
me
like
the
lease
that
the
--
the
regular
sections
would
be
for
the
restaurant
as
mentioned
by
mr.
rogers
across
the
street.
but
the
fact
that
those
of
us
know
when
we
run
across
leases
that
that
time
on
provision
is
entirely
different.
you
don't
have
that
in
a
normal
lease.
you
would
have
for
example
in
the
--
the
lease
in
the
gas
company
that
you
would
run
it
to
serve
our
employees,
etcetera,
etcetera
or
in
the
shopping
center
would
be
like
a
shopping
center.
and
the
reason
i
make
that
this
goes
obvious
this
was
not
to
be
as
mr.
rogers
have
you
to
believe,
a
--
a
restaurant
like
the
one
across
the
street.
that
was
the
--
my
whole
point
on
the
brief.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
i
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no
sir.
i
haven't
abandoned
it.
i
say
that
this
court
can
what
the
--
i
admit
mr.
rogers
is
right.
on
our
way
up,
we
lift
it
up
because
technically,
we
knew
it
was
not
then
in
the
record,
but
this
court
has
for
the
information
and
the
states
have
--
they
couldn't
give
it
and
then,
the
federal
government
gave
it
and
i
think
if
this
court
wants
to,
this
court
can
consider
it
as
a
part
of
the
whole
commerce
argument.
but
i
would
rather
put
my
basic
weight
on
the
morgan
case
because
i
think
the
morgan
case
is
sufficient
and
the
morgan
case
was
on
the
general
commerce
power
rather
than
the
motor
carrier
act.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
you
had
a
statute
that
said
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
mentioned
white
and
colored
passengers
they
didn't
have
--
it
didn't
have.
and
this
statute,
if
this
statute
it
said
that
any
negro
who
remains
on
property
have
to
be
told
to
move
would
be
guilty
of
a
crime,
would
be
automatically
unconstitutional.
this
statute
as
the
morgan
statute
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
then
we
--
except
for
the
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that
--
that's
what
i
was
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
was
getting
to
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
that
when
the
private
individual
decide
that
he
is
going
to
use
race,
then
state
cannot
come
in
and
become
a
party
too.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
no,
sir.
we
did
not
raise
it
in
the
petition.
the
last
place
it
was
raised
was
in
the
hustings
court.
bear
in
mind
that
we
didn't
have
to
be
--
not
have
an
argument
in
the
supreme
court
of
appeals,
they
denied
our
petition
for
writ
of
error.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
petition
for
writ
of
error,
the
petition
itself
is
--
in
virginia,
it's
like
a
brief
and
it
did
have
everything
in
it.
it
have
the
act,
the
clause,
it
has
everything
in
it.
because
that's
not
a
part
of
the
record,
it
never
is.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
because
they
printed
--
the
assignments
of
error,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
in
here.
and
i
think
that
the
--
the
virginia
rule
is
that
your
basis
of
appeal
is
limited
to
the
assignments
of
error
which
is
in
the
record.
but
the
question
you're
asking
in
our
petition
didn't
we
go
further,
we
did
--
we
covered
all
of
these
but
that's
not
a
part
of
the
record
which
you
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
it
was
before
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
thurgood
marshall
we
raised
it
in
the
petition.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
and
that
was
there
and
they
refused
to
give
us
the
--
the
writ
of
error.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
the
petition
here
--
yes,
sir.
we
did
not
mentioned
as
i
remember
it
didn't
used
the
motor
carrier
act
clause
at
all.
mr.
thurgood
marshall
thank
you,
sir.
