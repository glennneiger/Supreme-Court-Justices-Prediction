mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
can
think
there
are
only
two
propositions
that
would
be
appropriate
to
the
reply
that
i
here,
undertake,
both
in
the
view
of
the
rather
limited
scope
of
what's
been
brought
out
on
the
oral
argument
and
in
view
of
the
rather
limited
remaining
time.
i
should
suggest
your
honors
that
when
we
speak
of
whether
immunity
will
result
in
a
different
--
in
--
in
varying
situations,
we
get
into
rather
a
dangerous
area
of
comparing
equitable
immunity
in
a
situation
in
which
a
man
would
have
every
right
to
come
up
and
urge
to
a
trial
court,
"good
heavens,
look
what
happened
to
me
down
there
and
just
generally,
equitably,
i
ought
not
to
be
prosecuted."
on
the
one
hand,
with
statutory
immunity,
the
absolute,
complete
uncompromising
bar
on
the
other.
now,
equitable
immunity
will
indeed
arise
as
counsel
as
in
--
as
intimated
from
reliance
upon
the
government
in
his
representations
in
certain
circumstances.
however,
a
failure
to
perceive
on
the
basis
of
equitable
immunity
will
not
i
believe,
serve
as
a
basis
for
a
contempt
order.
the
statutory
immunity
of
the
provisions
i
think,
are
plain.
now,
i
would
take
some
issue
with
the
proposition
that
the
court
grants
immunity
in
these
situations,
just
as
the
isaac
case
does
and
just
as
counsel
here
did
not
seem
to
urge
with
any
great
vigor.
what
the
court
does
in
these
circumstances,
is
to
evaluate
the
petition
and
then
to
compel
the
witness
to
surrender
his
constitutional
immunity.
it
does
not
however,
grant
him
immunity
from
prosecution.
the
grant
is
statutory
and
close
from
the
witnesses
testifying,
with
reference
to
any
subject,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
he
has
first
claimed
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
then
thereafter,
testifies.
the
most
significant
words
in
the
statute
as
i
read
it,
are
having
first
claimed
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
or
words
of
that
genre.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
oh
certainly,
certainly
yes.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
yes,
sir.
this
is
true,
absolutely.
but
the
court
--
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
no,
sir.
the
court
does
not.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
if
i
understand,
your
honor,
properly
--
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
the
manner
of
this
action,
yes,
sir.
and
the
--
the
immunity
is
--
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
certainly,
your
honor.
absence
such
an
adjudication
there
could
be
no
immunity,
certainly.
now,
i
would
further
submit
to
your
honors
that
--
with
reference
to
counsel's
argument
rather
attenuated
on
the
proposition
of
the
effect
of
the
man's
subsequent
indictment.
counsel
points
out
i
think
quite
properly
that
you
couldn't
say
at
the
stage
of
which
--
at
which
the
--
the
petitioner
here
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
that
he
was
then
a
defendant,
nor
you
could
you
say
that
about
anybody
for
that
matter
that
the
grand
jury
is
subsequently
indicted.
yet,
it
did
return
indictments.
the
indictments
were
as
settled
law,
a
part
of
the
criminal
case
and
the
proceedings
before
the
grand
jury
were
as
it
evolved
a
part
of
the
criminal
case
against
piemonte.
counsel
suggests
to
your
honor
that
the
government
just
itself
voluntarily
dismissed
the
case.
this
was
done
after
some
six
weeks
of
trial
or
something
on
that
order
and
long
after
the
defendant
had
been
subjected
to
very,
very
serious
jeopardy
indeed.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
well,
your
honor,
i
would
--
i
would
think
of
--
of
my
experience
that
it
--
well,
it's
--
it's
not
customary.
it's
certainly
is
very
far
from
unique,
i
would
think.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir
it
does.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
in
any
case,
your
honor,
you
cannot
punish
a
man
in
my
view,
for
refusing
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
which
ultimately
indicts
him.
because
of
the
fact
in
his
refusal
to
testify
in
those
circumstances,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
not
to
be
justified
by
whether
his
testimony
might
incriminate
him.
rather,
it
is
an
absolute
privilege
not
to
testify,
he
need
not
to
show
that
the
testimony
might
incriminate
him.
he
need
only
to
show
ultimately
that
this
was
a
part
of
a
criminal
case
against
himself
and
this
mr.
piemonte
has
done.
the
fact
of
the
situation
is,
if
it
please
the
court,
that
without
--
the
statute
takes
away
his
right
to
refuse
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
might
incriminate
him
somewhere
else,
but
it
does
not
in
any
way
affect
his
right,
nor
does
the
order
affect
it
--
his
right
to
refuse
to
testify
in
a
criminal
case
against
himself.
my
time
is
expired.
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
the
sentence,
your
honor?
mr.
melvin
b.
lewis
18
months,
if
it
please
you.
thank
you
very
much.
