mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
government's
view,
the
petitioner
does
not
raise
any
of
the
problems
which
were
remaining
in
reina
or
which
were
dealt
with
in
reina.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
this
case
really
is
about
then
is
whether
or
not
on
this
record
in
the
district
court,
this
petitioner
was
fully
advised
and
was
granted
immunity
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
understood
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
and
whether
he
disobeyed
that
order.
in
order
to
understand
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
clearly
understood
on
whether
he
then
deliberately
disobeyed
the
order
and
thus
arose
the
contempt,
it's
necessary
to
go
over
the
facts
somewhat
and
perhaps
repeat
some
that
have
been
mentioned.
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
on
august
10th,
when
the
petitioner
was
called
for
this
grand
jury
hearing,
i
think
it's
important
to
--
in
considering
whether
or
not,
he
understood
and
whether
or
not
he
committed
contempt
to
view
the
entire
proceeding
of
what
happened
at
that
point.
one,
there
is
no
question
on
this
record
that
the
petitioner
consulted
with
his
attorney
prior
to
the
time
he
entered
into
the
grand
jury
room.
there
is
no
question
that
he
talked
to
his
attorney
specifically
about
answering
questions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
happened
was
this
petitioner,
despite
advice
from
his
attorney,
told
his
attorney
that
he
was
not
going
to
answer
any
questions.
he
was
going
to
stand
on
the
fifth
amendment.
that's
number
one.
the
second
thing
that's
important
is
that
as
we
started
to
ask
the
questions
at
the
grand
jury,
the
first
thing
that
we
asked
the
petitioner
was
in
regard
to
his
previous
conviction,
which
he
readily
admit,
and
the
next
series
of
questions
were
related
to
that
particular
conviction.
it
is
true,
it
is
true
that
the
government,
at
that
time,
told
the
petitioner
that
he
did
not
think
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
claim
the
privilege
insofar
as
those
questions
were
related
to
the
convictions
on
which
he
was
then
serving
time.
that
is
true.
and
as
--
immediately
after
that
thatthe
petitioner
note
--
said,
"well,
i'm
not
going
to
answer
any
questions."
after
that,
the
government
asked
a
series
of
approximately
50
some
questions,
having
to
do
generally
with
narcotics,
having
to
do
with
--
in
some
instances
with
the
conviction,
this
heroin
that
he
had
previously
sold,
having
to
do
with
marijuana,
having
to
do
with
his
knowledge
of
such
people
as
john
omento
(ph)
from
new
york,
having
to
do
with
his
knowledge
of
a
previous
codefendant.
and
all
of
these
questions,
the
petitioner
declined
to
answer
claiming
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
that's
on
august
10.
on
august
13,
this
matter
was
presented
before
judge
campbell.
at
that
time,
the
government
said,
“we
believe
that
the
petitioner
properly
claimed
his
privilege
in
the
light
of
some
recent
appellate
cases.”
the
government
then
explained
to
the
judge
what
they
were
there
for.
that
they
were
there
to
present
this
transcript
to
the
grand
jury
to
the
judge
so
that
he
could
decide
and
that
they
would
--
going
to
present
a
petition
to
the
court
for
a
grant
of
immunity.
the
court
was
presented
with
the
transcript
and
the
court
read,
quite
obviously
in
this
record,
read
the
questions
that
were
asked
and
the
answer
that
were
given.
and
the
court
expressed
doubt
as
to
whether
the
privilege
was
properly
claimed
as
to
those
question
which
related
to
the
conviction,
but
the
court
also
said
as
to
the
adage,
there
was
no
question
however
that
the
privilege
was
properly
claimed.
at
that
point,
the
government
presented
to
the
court
a
written
petition,
which
i
do
not
believe
is
challenged
by
this
petitioner
as
to
form,
setting
out
everything
that
was
required
in
the
statute,
and
i
might
say
this
isn't
the
exact
type
of
petition
that
were
presented
in
reina,
corona,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
almost
all
the
narcotic
cases.
the
crucial
point
that
the
government
feels
is
important
to
understand
is
what
happened
next.
the
court
said,
"very
well,
i
find
the
petition
in
proper
form,
the
same
is
granted."
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned,
that
was
it,
no
further
finding,
no
further
interrogation,
no
further
problems
of
roads.
the
petition
was
granted,
he's
--
the
court
said
so
in
unequivocal
terms.
it
is
hard
to
say
at
this
time
that
this
was
not
understood,
but
i
would
go
further.
after
this,
the
court
addressed
itself
directly
to
the
petitioner
and
explained
in
other
words
what
was
going
on
that
he'd
been
granted
immunity
that
he
no
longer
need
claim
his
privilege.
in
this
connection,
as
to
what
he
was
asked
to
respond
to,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
directly
at
the
record.
on
page
16,
the
--
the
court
says
partway
down
after
paragraph
--
telling
him
that
it's
no
longer
necessary
to
claim
the
fifth
amendment
closes
with
this.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
this
follows
the
entry
of
the
oral
--
at
the
beginning
of
--
at
the
--
near
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
top
of
16.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
same
day.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
same
day.
at
the
--
at
--
near
the
top
of
16,
your
honor,
you
will
find
the
words
that
i
previously
mentioned,
“very
well,
i
find
the
petition
in
proper
form,
the
same
is
granted.”
those
who
know
and
experienced
district
court
practice
can
very
well
visualize
exactly
what's
happening
at
that
point
because
the
judge
is
just
signing
an
order.
whether
or
not,
this
--
this
actually
takes
place
on
the
record,
of
course,
it
never
is
disclosed.
but
below
this,
where
the
court
is
explaining
to
the
defendant,
and
this
is
an
important
thing,
"i
now
grant
you
immunity
from
such
prosecution
and
direct
you
to
answer
the
questions
propounded
to
you
by
the
grand
jury
and
the
next
thing
is
do
you
understand
the
order
of
this
court
--
of
the
court?"
and
the
petitioner
replies,
"yes,
sir,
your
honor."
but
we
go
further
in
this
case
because
immediately
after
this,
at
the
request
of
the
petitioner,
the
court
makes
specific
provision
for
this
petitioner
to
see
his
counsel
again,
directs
the
united
states
government
not
to
bring
this
petitioner
back
before
the
grand
jury
until
he
has
had
an
opportunity
to
see
his
lawyer
again.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
could
he
be
indicted
for
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
you
mean
after
this,
if
he'd
been
asked
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
it
had
to
do
with
narcotics
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
i
supposed
it
would,
but
if
it
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
--
if
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
i
suppose
if
they
said
to
him,
"mr.
piemonte,
did
you
rob
the
first
national
bank?",
which
is
entirely
an
unrelated
thing,
i
would
imagine
that
he
did
not
have
immunity
to
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
this
petitioner
had
that
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
this
petitioner
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
let
me
--
let
me
go
to
the
specific
problem
that
you
were
talking
about
previously.
the
question
of
how
specific
this
type
of
thing
has
to
be
because
this
is
not
a
new
problem
in
this
field.
in
a
case
called
hale
versus
henkel,
which
is
decided
long
ago,
the
same
problem
was
presented
to
this
court.
in
numerous
cases
since
that
date,
exactly
the
same
problem
has
been
presented
to
this
court.
this
problem
is
not
confined,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
merely
to
immunity
statues.
this
is
a
general
problem
involving
any
type
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
--
in
--
i'm
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
statute
only
gives
the
government
the
power
to
ask
for
immunity
in
regard
to
this
statute.
we
do
not
have
the
power
to
ask
--
the
congress
has
--
would
never
give
us
this
right.
while
you
--
you
raise
a
question
which
i
--
i
can't
imagine
happening,
but
it's
a
possibility
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
not
in
this
context
because
this
whole
grand
jury
had
to
do
with
narcotics.
and
it
was
so
stated
and
that's
what
they
would
there
for
and
that's
why
this
witness
was
called
and
that's
what
was
so
stated.
so
i
cannot
say
that
--
that
we
--
that
we
could
--
that
anyone
can
grant
him
immunity
from
a
bank
robbery
because
as
far
as
i
read
it,
congress
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
can't.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
at
that
point,
i
think
that
the
question
gets
close
enough
that
--
that
the
government
is
bound
by
the
immunity
that
he's
been
given
to
any
transaction
related
to
it,
yes.
i
don't
think
--
in
other
words,
i
--
i
cannot
see
that
we
can
read
this
so
narrowly
as
the
petitioner
would
--
would
in
--
like
to
theorize
on.
if
we
had
to
get
immunity
specifically
as
to
each
question,
i
doubt
that
the
statute
could
be
used
because
i
think
it's
clear
to
those
who
have
ever
asked
questions
that
one
question
leads
to
another
question.
you
can't
--
you
can't
imagine
what
the
next
question
will
be
in
a
grand
jury
and
what
does
this
would
amount
to,
is
asking
the
government
on
each
question
to
bring
the
petitioner
back
in
front
of
the
court
and
say,
"you
now
answer
this
one
and
then
we'd
go
back
and
answer
the
last
one."
and
then
after
getting
that
answer,
well,
then
a
new
approach,
of
course,
would
--
would
come
to
the
government
and
they
would
ask
another
question.
of
course,
we'd
start
all
over
again.
i
--
seriously,
this
--
i've
never
seen
it
this
way.
my
experience
is
that
in
all
these
cases,
it
has
been
a
general
grant
of
immunity,
and
that
it
is
always
covered
all
questions
and
it
covered
questions
that
were
not
specifically
asked,
but
in
the
general
category.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
would
--
unhesitatingly
i
--
i
say.
there
is
no
question
that
he
gets
immunity
as
to
that
type.
and
i'll
go
further
not
even
specifically
as
to
what
he
testifies
to.
this
--
in
other
words,
if
he
just
says,
"i
--
i
robbed
the
first
national
bank.
he
--
it's
everything
in
relation
to
that
transaction."
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
something
that's
narrow
because
if
it's
narrow,
then
we
do
have
a
lot
of
problems.
and
it
has
never
been
considered
narrow.
and
i
--
and
--
and
none
of
the
cases
have
ever
considered
it
narrow,
although,
as
i
say,
the
problem
of
specificity
and
ability
to
prove
has
been
argued
many
times
in
this
court.
and
this
problem,
while
you
can
think
about
it,
is
no
different
than
any
other
problem
of
proof
and
has
been
answered
that
way
in
all
the
cases.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
i
do
know.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
have
--
at
--
at
the
time
of
the
reina
argument,
we
included
in
our
brief
a
footnote
as
to
this
particular
immunity
statute,
and
there
were
13
grants
of
immunity
since
the
beginning
of
this
statute
down
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
through
and
that
includes
--
that
includes
this
petitioner
and
all
these
cases.
there
--
so
it
is
not
used
--
well,
i
should
say
it's
not
used
very
extensively
because
it
is
not
an
easy
procedure
and
it's
deliberately
not
easy.
we
--
we
have
to
--
you
--
you
have
to
get
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
requires
a
--
a
complete
application,
and
it
--
i
think
congress
deliberately
made
it
hard
so
that
it
would
not
--
the
--
the
congress
certainly
is
not
about
to
give
immunity
to
many
people.
they
do
not
believe
that
this
is
a
good
practice.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i'm
sorry.
what
i
meant
was
in
relation
to
the
general
immunity
provisions,
which
are
old,
there's
a
long
history
of
immunity
provisions,
specific
ones
relating
to
internal
security
and
they
are
in
numerous
regulatory
acts.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
--
that's
correct.
so
that
there
is
a
long
history
of
immunity
upon
which
each
particular
section
has
been
built
so
that
this
statute
is
a
culmination
of
a
long
series
of
cases
and
history
related
to
immunity
in
many
fields.
and
i
--
i
do
not
i
think
it
can
be
divorced
from
that
because,
surely,
each
clause,
in
turn,
almost
relates
to
some
case
that
this
court
has
decided
or
some
provision
of
law.
now,
to
go
back
to
the
--
the
--
what
happened
at
this
district
court.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
mr.
chief
justice,
just
prior
to
the
recess
mr.
--
a
question
was
asked
with
regard
directly
to
the
statute.
and
i
think
the
government's
answer
without
any
question
is
that
the
man
has
immunity.
and
i
think
this
is
related
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
asked
me
and
i
like
to
explain
it
in
these
terms.
take
this
example,
if
we
take
piemonte
in
this
particular
context
and
he
was
at
the
point
where
he
was
granted
immunity
by
the
court
and
then
he
is
now
taken
in
front
of
a
grand
jury,
the
same
grand
jury
that
day
or
the
next
day
as
happened
here.
and
the
very
first
question
that's
--
i
think
this
is
a
part
of
it.
the
very
first
question
is,
“now,
did
you
rob
the
first
national
bank?”
i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
he
has
immunity
in
regard
to
that
transaction.
and
i
say
it
for
the
same
reason
that
i
answered
the
chief
justice.
and
that
this
--
the
prosecutor
has
decided
quite
clearly
in
that
case
that
this
is
relevant
to
the
inquiry.
i
do
not
think
that
the
witness
has
to
decide
or
should
decide
what
is
relevant
to
the
narcotics
inquiry
if
the
prosecutor
chooses
to
open
up
this
avenue
and
that's
where
we're
going.
and
in
this
connection
of
course,
it's
true
the
prosecutor
and
he
usually
told
to
be
very
careful
because
congress
has
continually
told
the
prosecutors,
"don't
give
anybody
an
immunity
bath,"
as
they
term
it.
but
i
say
very
clearly
without
any
question,
that
if
the
prosecutor
in
this
grand
jury
asked
this
question,
he
does
get
immunity.
now,
this
doesn't
always
have
to
happen
in
this
sequence
and
it's
only
when
you
get
away
from
this
particular
--
the
particular
facts
here
that
i
come
to
another
problem
namely
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
think
you're
--
i
think
that's
right
because
as
you
originally
pointed
out
your
honor,
many
of
these
do
have
a
great
connection
with
--
and
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
and
i
don't
think
--
i
don't
think
it's
up
to
the
witness
to
decide
where
the
prosecutor
is
going.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
suppose
so.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
think
the
witness
is
entitled
to
rely
on
the
government.
if
the
government
tells
me
he
has
immunity
in
this
circumstance
and
the
government
then
asks
him
a
question
which
the
government
thinks
is
relevant,
i
think
the
witness
has
a
right
to
rely
upon.
i
think
the
statute
gives
him
immunity.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
now,
may
i
make
this
clear?
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
brown
and
walker.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
now,
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
have
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
let
me
add
this
--
this
--
let
me
add
--
may
i
have
this
problem
here?
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
instances
and
they're
not
usual
in
this
type
of
field,
because
it
just
doesn't
come
up.
but
where
we
would
have
let's
say,
a
small
town
grand
jury
who
have
the
problem
of
investigating
a
lot
of
things
besides
narcotics
and
where
the
grand
jury
has
under
consideration
a
great
deal
more
than
they
would
have
in
this
--
in
this
case,
i
can
see
a
situation
where
the
prosecutor
may
say
to
a
witness
even
after
the
grant
of
immunity
and
in
the
grand
jury
after
discussing
the
narcotics
situations
say
to
this
witness,
either
them
or
some
weeks
later.
now,
the
questions
that
i
am
about
to
ask
you
are
not
related
to
the
immunity
that
you
were
granted
and
i
am
telling
you
so,
they
are
related
to
another
matter
which
this
grand
jury
is
investigating.
under
those
circumstances,
i
do
not
--
and
if
--
without
any
question
that
this
was
made
clear,
i
would
say
unto
those
circumstances
the
statute
does
not,
does
not
grant
immunity
to
the
--
the
questions
that
would
come
after
that.
now
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
let
me
--
let
me
get
it
to
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
suppose
you're
asking
a
question
which
the
judge
didn't
have
in
mind
when
he
--
when
he
told
him
this
and
that
--
at
the
troubles
made
because
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
no.
you
--
you
see,
we're
starting
at
a
different
point.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
well,
that's
as
important
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
because
this
is
important
because
the
petitioner
raises
this
type
of
problem
in
this
case.
there
is
such
a
case
on
the
books
and
it's
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
is
such
a
case
on
the
books
and
it
is
called
isaac
in
which
--
in
which
the
judge
said
to
a
man,
“you're
granted
immunity
for
--
so
go
ahead
and
answer
these
questions."
and
the
eighth
circuit
held,
"no,
that
is
not
--
a
judge
cannot
just
go
off
and
give
somebody
immunity."
so
i
--
i've
got
to
be
careful
that
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
we
have
to
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
we
have
to
start
mr.
justice
black
with
a
problem
of
a
narcotic
question
under
this
statute
or
a
relevant
question
under
any
other
immunities
that
i
think
they
all
work
the
same.
if
you
don't
start
with
an
investigation
in
regard
to
which
the
immunity
statute
is
directed,
i
do
not
think
that
any
judge
either
has
authority
or
can
just
give
immunity.
so,
we
have
to
start
with
a
--
with
a
general
type
of
narcotic
investigation.
now
then,
after
that
and
--
and
after
complying
with
the
statute
in
that
regard,
then
the
judge
let's
say
as
in
this
case,
told
him
to
go
back
and
answer
these
questions
in
front
of
this
grand
jury.
i
think
at
that
point
as
i
told
mr.
justice
stewart
that
if
the
first
question
is
in
regard
to
this
bank,
i
think
everyone
is
entitled
to
understand
that
that
is
relevant
and
it
has
to
do
with
narcotics
and
it's
a
link
in
the
chain
and
as
the
chief
justice
mentioned,
many
of
these
people
have
to
get
their
money
by
robbing
and
--
and
murdering
is
not
unusual
for
them
to
be
involved
in
this
and
this
would
get
into
the
whole
controversy.
therefore
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
may
not
be
relevant.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
--
well,
let
me
say
this,
the
question
of
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
know.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
know.
in
regard
to
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me,
i
--
i
can
say
that
i
have
been
authorized
to
give
the
answer
that
i
gave
to
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
the
--
well,
i
don't
--
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
don't
see
any
--
i'm
sorry,
i
--
i
say,
i
do
not
think
the
judge
does,
but
i
don't
think
that
conflicts
with
my
answer
to
--
i
--
i
may
--
i
may
not
be
under
--
i
maybe
misunderstanding
your
question,
but
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
let
me
--
let
me
understand
your
question.
if
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
says
is
true,
and
if
--
we
start
with
this
premise
and
then,
if
what
he's
asked
a
question
outside
--
to
clear
the
outside,
is
he
granted
immunity?
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
no.
because
you're
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
starting
with
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
premise
that
the
judge
isn't
going
to
grant
or
can't.
i
don't
mean
to
quiver
about
the
words,
“can't
give
that
immunity.”
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no
--
not
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
we're
in
disagreement
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
i
am
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
you
see
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
let
me
--
may
i
explain
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
--
i
think
we're
in
agreement,
but
it's
going
to
be
hard,
it
--
a
little
difficult
to
explain.
i
do
not
think
this
is
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
saying.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
well,
this
is
the
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
if
i
may
say
this
is
the
type
of
example
that
i
was
giving
when
i
said,
“if
you
get
the
type
of
grant,
this
is
unusual
and
that's
why
it's
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
--
to
visualize
this
problem,
because
i
assume
it
--
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
suppose
that
--
that
a
prosecutor
is
going
to
ask
questions
within
the
scope.
or
problem
comes
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
have
been.
the
problem
here
--
there
are
certain
--
or
let
me
put
it
this
way,
there
certainly
is
no
problem
in
this
case
about
any
--
anywhere
near
this
type
of
question,
this
--
none
of
this
ever
happened
in
this
case.
this
--
this
petitioner
clearly
understood
what
the
questions
were
and
there's
no
question
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
oh,
yes.
they're
similar
in
my
--
i
--
i
should
explain
this
about
his
lawyer.
the
counsel
says,
well,
he
didn't
--
the
government
didn't
notify
his
lawyer
to
be
there
on
the
14th
or
13th,
when
he
was
granted
immunity
because
this
isn't
in
the
record.
i
don't
think
you
have
the
right
to
assume
that
the
government
didn't
notify
anybody.
facts
are
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
the
facts
are
he
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
and
there
is--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
never
once.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
he
had
a
lawyer
to
consult
with
before
he
went
into
the
grand
jury,
the
record
shows
the
judge
very
carefully
saw
to
it
that
he
had
a
lawyer
to
check
with
these
--
this
if
he
had
this
type
of
problem,
check
with
the
boy
who
went
into
the
grand
jury
at
the
second
time.
the
--
it's
very
clear
that
a
lawyer
was
present
at
the
time
in
order
to
show
cause
was
entered.
and
of
course
at
that
time
and
there's
only
one
answer
that
he
was
called
by
the
government.
he
was
there
throughout
this
type
of
proceeding.
he
did
not
raise
anything
like
this
in
the
--
on
the
hearing.
i
know
he
had
time
to
prepare
for
the
hearing.
every
question
that
he
raised
at
the
time
of
the
hearing,
the
judge
clarified.
we
think
the
problems
which
this
petitioner
is
now
raising,
which
were
not
raised
before
the
district
judge
would
have
been
similarly
handled
by
the
district
judge.
and
in
any
event,
there
was
no
confusion
on
petitioner's
part
as
to
whether
or
not
the
questions
were
outside
the
scope
or
inside
or
any
this
type
of
thing,
there
was
never
any
question
about
it.
and
the
petitioner
has
said
so
himself
that
there
was
no
question
about
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
they
are.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that
--
well,
i
think,
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think,
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
that
the
prosecutor
and
as
far
as
i
know,
they
always
do,
they
ask
some
questions
relevant
to
the
narcotic
statute.
now,
it
maybe
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things
related
to
getting
at
a
conviction
of
narcotics
and
the
statute
is
broad
in
that
scope
namely
any
testimony
or
any
transaction.
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
pinpoint
--
the
--
the
violation
doesn't
have
to
be
pinpointed
and
the
question
doesn't
have
to
be
pinpointed
in
order
to
grant
a
greater
immunity.
but
i
--
i've
always
assumed
that
the
prosecutors
will
ask
questions
as
they're
--
in
--
in
this
--
in
this
field.
certainly,
the
united
states
attorney
when
he
made
the
affidavit
told
the
judge,
“this
was
a
grand
jury
investigating
trafficking
narcotics.”
and
that's
all
the
evidence
in
this
record
shows
that's
exactly
what
was
going
on.
and
the
--
all
the
prosecutor's
questions,
well,
some
of
them
certainly,
with
some
of
--
"do
you
know
john
doe?"
does
not
on
its
face
say
anything
about
narcotics.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
i
--
i
think
i
tried
to
explain
that
if
the
prosecutor
clearly
indicates
something
like
this,
then
we've
got
another
problem.
and
--
and
that
it's
not
only
far
removed
from
this
case,
but
it
--
it's
hard
for
me
to
visualize
it
in
this
context
mostly
because
this
type
of
investigation
is
not
one
of
this
free
willing
type
of
investigations
of
crime
in
general.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
all
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
said
that
and
i
say
it
again.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
i
--
i
--
and
i
say,
i
don't
--
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
qualification
to
what
i
said
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
about
the
statute.
i
do
not
think
there's
a
qualification
to
anything
that
i
told
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
i
--
and
when
--
before
recess,
when
you
asked
me
about
bank
robbery
and
--
and
other
related,
i
--
and
i
--
i
think
i
answered
quite
positively
that
he
had
immunity.
i
--
i've
--
i
still
say
that
all
of
these
answers
are
consistent
in
exactly
what
i
mean,
all
the
way
through.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
my
answer
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
was
to
mr.
justice
potter
stewart.
they
asked
--
there's
no
question.
if
the
first
question
is
about
bank
robbery
and
the
second
question
is
about
the
murder
of
john
jones
and
the
third
question
is
about
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
somewhat,
my
answer
is
exactly
the
same
as
it
would.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
this
question
differs
from
the
previous.
i
think
that's
why
i
hesitate
about
the
answer.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
you
see
there
were
three.
there
were
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
--
i
just
don't
see
any
difference
in
the
answer.
now,
let
me
try
to
explain
why
i
don't
see
any
difference.maybe
that
will
explain
why
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
on
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
my
answer
is
yes
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
but
i
have
to
explain
this.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
--
i
think
it's
relevant.
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
don't
believe
--
no,
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
don't
believe
he
said
--
no,
and
wait
a
minute
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
he
--
no,
let
me
--
let
me
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
first,
let
me
--
may
i
first
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
had
try
to
keep
with
the
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
as
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
may
i
try
to
rephrase
at
my
language
so
that
we'll
understand,
because
i
think
it's
important.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
you
asked
me
whether
or
not
this
petitioner,
he
first
walks
into
the
courtroom
beyond
the
three
questions
which
i've
used
as
examples,
now.
he
asked
him
a
whole
strew
of
questions
about
everything
under
the
--
go
right
down
the
whole
criminal
code,
lets
say.
i
mean
that's
the
far
as
broad
as
i
can
imagine.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
you
said
to
me,
“do
we
understand
that
the
government's
position
is
this
witness
has
immunity
in
regard
to
each
and
everyone.”
i
don't
know
whether
you
used
each
and
everyone.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
but
it's
that
--
and
that's
every
one
of
those
questions
are
answers.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
my
answer
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
well,
but
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
my
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
no,
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
--
no,
i
don't
want
to
think
this
is
not
a
bother.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
not
--
i
--
i
do
not
believe
that
chief
justice
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
wait
a
minute.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
no
--
wait
a
minute.
the
problem
--
the
problem
is
that
is
you
see,
i
--
i
would
agree
to
the
--
let
me
go
to
another
spectrum
maybe
to
help
answer
this.
if
--
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
if
the
united
states
attorney
or
whoever
is
interrogating
the
--
in
front
of
the
grand
jury
says
to
a
witness
in
front
of
the
grand
jury,
“now,
i
am
now
about
to
ask
you
some
questions
on
narcotics.
the
judge
did
--
or
on
that
counterfeiting.
the
judge
has
not
granted
you
immunity
on
counterfeiting
and
i
am
telling
you
in
no
uncertain
terms,
do
you
understand
that?”
and
if
the
witness
says,
yes,
i
under
--
i
don't
mean
that
you
have
to
use
a
particular
formula.
what
i'm
getting
to
is
that
--
now,
i
think
it
would
be
unrealistic,
unrealistic
to
assume
that
that
petitioner
then
thought
he
had
immunity
after
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
so,
i
think
was
the
plan
--
and
i
--
i
think
that's
what
you
mentioned.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
now
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
one
of
my
--
my
--
what
i'm
really
getting
to
is
the
--
i
think
you
have
to
deal
in
real
life
situations.
if
everyone
on
the
grand
jury
was
so
certain
and
so
clear
about
this
whole
thing,
i
think
the
petitioner
wouldn't
--
i
don't
think,
whatever
the
question
about
whether
he
thought
he
had
immunity
either.
i
mean
he
can't
do
perfectly
abstract
about
the
problem.
these
are
people
that
understand
things.
and
this
petitioner,
i
don't
think
--
well
certainly
on
his
motive,
let
me
add
and
while
it
--
it
is
relevant
to
this
extent
in
this
case,
certainly
on
his
motive
for
not
answering,
which
he
said
that
he
was
afraid,
i
think
there's
no
question
that
he
wasn't
worried
about
the
confusion
problem
or
anything
else
and
his
lawyer
was
not
worried
about
any
confusion
and
very
clearly,
his
lawyer
told
the
judge
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
to
show
cause
that
the
real
reason
this
defendant
is
not
answering
is
because
he's
afraid.
no
one
said
anything
about
as
the
petitioner
now
raises
some
questions
whether
you
can
ask
marijuana
questions,
we
think
it
clearly
covered.
we
--
if
the
question
as
to
the
scope
of
the
grant,
this
type
of
problem
i
suppose,
can
always
be
raised.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
--
the
scope
was
raised
in
reina,
the
same
type
of
question.
that
we
--
we
can
get
--
you
can
always
enumerate
a
number
of
questions
after
the
fact
that
could
have
created
a
confusion.
but
we
think
if
you
really
read
the
record
that
you
find
that
the
government
was
not
only
fair
to
this
petitioner,
or
watched
his
--
his
rights
all
the
way
through.
and
if
anything,
the
colloquy
about
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he
should
have
been
granted
of
privilege
or
not,
i
think
all
it
goes
to
is
the
fact
that
the
government
bought
more
it
had
to
buy,
if
anything.
that
we
did
not
have
to
grant
as
--
all
this
immunity,
but
we
did
out
of
the
matter.
fairness
wouldn't
have
to
pick
and
choose,
we
did
grant
more.
of
course,
this
is
normal
in
a
number
of
cases
that
happened
in
reina,
it
happened
in
brown
versus
walker,
the
very
first
case.
the
--
there's
no
question,
the
whole
opinion
talks
great
deal
about
the
fact
that
the
auditor
may
not
have
been
incriminating
himself
at
all,
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
--
on
the
questions.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i'll
--
i'll
go
that
immediately.
the
government's
view
on
the
--
on
the
indictment
is
that
this
is
irrelevant
to
this
case.
first
of
all,
this
petitioner
was
not
a
defendant
in
a
case
at
the
time
of
the
grand
jury.
there's
no
question
about
that.
there's
an
assumption.
this
--
this
petitioner
was
not
a
target
of
this
grand
jury.
this
comes
nowhere
near
the
type
of
case
where
we
get
concerned
about
who's
being
interrogated
in
front
of
a
grand
jury.
in
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
posed
the
question
as
if
he
had
stood
mute.
and
that
that
was
all
that
was
necessary.
now,
without
getting
into
the
vagaries
of
grand
juries
and
why
they
indict
and
why
they
do
not
indict,
if
anything
--
if
anything,
we
think
--
and
this
goes
to
the
whole
scope
of
all
legal
questions
including
even
fairness,
if
anything,
they
all
arise
if
at
all
in
the
indictment
case.
and
this
is
true
even
under
the
statute.
if
we
read
the
statute
in
its
narrowest
terms,
wit,
that
the
government
had
merely
an
election
and
i
think
that's
much
more
narrowly
than
the
statute
should
be
read
in
election.
the
statute
specifically
says
and
from
the
last
clause
of
it,
“no
witness
shall
be
exempt
under
this
section
from
prosecution
for
perjury
or
contempt.”
we're
clear,
they
would
end
this
statute.
this
is
not
to
say
that
there
may
not
be
problems
in
another
case,
as
with
this
court
has
had
other
cases
like
that.
and
one
of
them
that
come
to
mind
is
regan
versus
new
york.
a
serious
problem
or
much
more
serious
than
this,
because
in
that
case,
the
man
had
waived
immunity,
so
that
he
clearly
was
going
to
be
not
only
indicted,
but
could
be
held
in
contempt.
so
the
clear
problem
in
this
court
very
clearly
understood,
those
problems
can
arrive
and
they'll
be
handled
in
another
case,
if
they
are
problems
at
all.
we
do
not
say
that
this
is
a
criminal
case.
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
this
man
was
not
a
defendant.
if
this
man
were
as
the
petitioner
so
places
him,
he
certainly
would've
been
entitled
to
a
lawyer
right
then
and
there,
in
the
grand
jury
room.
and
i
have
yet
--
i
do
not
believe
this
court
has
ever
felt
that.
certainly,
there's
no
difference
in
the
calling
it
a
witness
statute
and
the
fifth
amendment
uses
the
same
term.
i
mean,
we're
not
--
we're
not
talking
about
words
then
in
those
--
in
those
terms.
i
cannot
see
how
and
i
know
of
no
case,
how
a
subsequent
proceeding
entirely
unrelated,
because
it's
a
crime
in
narcotics
and
the
other,
this
case
is
about
disobeying
a
court
order,
how
it
can
retroactively
knockout
and
that's
the
way
i
read
it,
“knockout
a
judgment
that
a
--
a
court
has
made
without
more
than
that.”
i
know
of
no
case
that
would
so
hold.
it
is
the
reverse
argument
that
was
made
in
reina.
reina
wanted
a
pardon
for
what
he'd
already
--
and
this
is
just
the
other
way
around
that
he
wants
something
that
he
may
not
be
entitled
to.
but
if
he
were
even,
that
would
be
a
problem
which
clearly
should
be
raised
in
the
indictment
case
in
whatever
it's
worth
it.
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
will
not
come
because
the
indictment
was
dismissed
by
the
government
because
the
witness
was
unable
to
identify
piemonte
at
that
time
of
the
trial.
and
that's
clearly
disclosed
on
the
record.
unless
there
are
some
other
questions
your
honor,
why
i
think
that
covers
the
problem
for
the
government.
thank
you.
