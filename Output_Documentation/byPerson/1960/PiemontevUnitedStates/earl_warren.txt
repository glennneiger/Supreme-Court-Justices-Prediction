mr.
lewis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilinsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilinksy,
just
to
reduce
this
to
practicalities,
it's
--
it's
not
uncommon
for
the
narcotic
traffic
for
particularly
those
who
are
users
to
be
common
thieves,
and
they
get
their
money
from
burglarizing
homes
and
burglarizing
buildings,
from
breaking
into
automobiles
and
from
--
and
from
doing
all
kinds
of
things
like
that.
now,
this
man
--
they
asked
this
man,
"from
whom
did
you
purchase
these
narcotics?"
and
he
says,
"john
doe."
and
i
said,
"where
did
you
get
the
money
to
--
where
did
you
get
the
money
from?"
and
he
said,
"well,
i
--
i
burglarized
a
household
here
in
the
street,
and
i
burglarized
that
one
over
there.
and
i
--
i've
stole
it
from
--
picked
somebody's
pocket
or
i
did
this
and
this
and
that."
will
he
then
--
would
he
then
get
immunity
from
prosecutions
for
those
crimes?
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it.
i
think
there's
no
question
about
it
that
he
would.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then,
if
he
had
robbed
the
banks
to
do
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
same
things
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
often
--
how
often
is
this
statute,
do
you
--
do
you
know,
mr.
gilinsky?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't.i
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
no
idea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
13
grants.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
may
i
ask
you?
you
said
this
has
always
been
given
the
broad
construction
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
13
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
times
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
how
much.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
answer
that
after
lunch,
mr.
gilinsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilinsky,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
can
we
just
pursue
this
just
a
little
farther?
apparently,
that
the
robbing
in
the
first
national
bank
is
well
about
as
far
away
from
a
narcotic
bracket
and
as
you
would
expect
almost
any
other
crime
to
be.
now,
does
that
mean
that
--
that
any
question
that
he
asks
would
--
would
confer
immunity?
any
question
whether
it's
--
it's
murder
or
robbery
or
--
or
anything
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
the
jury
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
that
is
true
and
the
--
the
defendant
answers
the
question
that
he's
asked
under
that
injunction
of
the
court,
is
he
--
is
he
subject
to
prosecution
for
the
crime?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
gilinsky,
but
--
you
opened
the
discussion
this
afternoon
by
saying,
if
after
this
--
this
petitioner
had
been
asked
to
--
or
have
been
required
to
--
to
testify
under
the
--
under
the
immunity
statute,
the
--
if
the
first
--
the
first
question
that
the
district
attorney
asked
was,
"did
you
rob
the
first
national
bank?"
you
say
that
if
he
answered
that
question
yes,
he
gets
immunity.
now,
that
is
--
that
is
just
about
as
far
away
from
the
narcotic
bracket
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
anything
could
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
be.
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
well
now,
let
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
put
it
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way,
if
--
if
he
had
said,
“do
you
know
john
--
john
doe
and
richard
roe
and
--
and
did
you
have
any
--
did
you
use
any
narcotics
on
a
certain
day
with
them?
yes.
and
did
you
go
any
place
with
them
after
that?
and
did
that
eventually
been
the
robbery
of
the
first
national
bank?
now,
that's
one
thing.
but
you
put
it
to
us
boldly,
you
said,
he
walks
right
in
there
and
--
and
said,
“did
you
rob
--
did
you
rob
the
bank?”
and
the
fellow
says,
yes
and
you
say
he
has
immunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
couldn't
he
ask
him
about
murder?
couldn't
he
ask
him
about
anything
under
the
sun
that
he
wanted
to?
and
if
that
is
true,
how
can
you
--
how
can
you
get
away
from
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said
that
he
then
gets
immunity
for
any
question
that
he
answers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you'd
got
be
in
disagreement
with
one
of
the
other
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
even
mr.
justice
stewart
or
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
they've
--
they've
put
different
situations
to
you
and
different
answers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
you
want
--
be
more
comfort
to
a
defendant
though,
if
he
was
asked
a
question
of
that
kind
and
he
answered
it,
"yes,
i
robbed
--
robbed
the
bank."
and
then
the
courts
came
along
and
said
that
--
that
it
wasn't
within
the
immunity
statutes
and
therefore,
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
was
talking
about
the
consciences
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
conscience
of
the
district
attorney.
but
this
--
this
man,
who's
asked
the
question
with
the
peril
of
going
to
the
penitentiary,
doesn't
know
what
his
conscience
is
or
how
he's
exercising
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
didn't
have
to
let
me
get
back
to
your
original
statement
when
you
opened
--
opened
the
discussion
this
afternoon
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
after
deliberation
over
the
new
(inaudible).
you
came
in
and
you
said
positively
that
if
--
if
this
man
went
before
the
grand
jury
under
this
order
of
the
court
granting
him
immunity
in
this
narcotic
investigation,
if
the
district
attorney
asked
him,
did
--
first
question,
"did
you
rob
the
first
national
bank?"
and
he
said,
"yes."
he
would
be
immunized.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
let
--
let
me
pursue
it
just
one
--
one
question
farther
then.
if
without
telling
him
that
--
that
he's
going
beyond
the
immunity
or
beyond
the
order
of
the
judge.
he
asked
him
about
a
bank
robbery,
he
asked
him
about
a
murder,
he
asked
him
about
a
burglary
and
any
other
number
of
--
of
crimes
with
--
without
any
showing
beforehand
that
they
were
at
all
connected
with
--
with
narcotics.
would
he
be
immunized?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
if
i
may
pursue
just
one
question
farther
then,
when
a
man
goes
before
the
grand
jury
under
an
order
of
this
kind,
he
gets
immunity
under
any
answer
that
he
makes
unless
the
prosecutor
says,
now,
i've
finished
with
this
matter
that
--
that
was
referred
to
--
to
me
here
by
the
order
of
the
court
and
i
now
want
to
pursue
counterfeiting
or
something
else
as
justice
frankfurter
has
--
has
said.
up
until
that
time,
any
question
with
the
prosecutor
asked
and
he
answers
immunizing
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
think
it
--
it
does,
but
it
gets
to
what
justice
stewart
asked
you
about.
he
said,
doesn't
it
give
--
give
them
complete
immunity
as
to
everything
concerning
which
he
has
interrogated
by
the
district
attorney.
now,
the
only
thing
i
had
is
unless
the
prosecutor
says
"now,
we're
through
with
that
business
and
we'll
now
go
on
to
something
detached
--
totally
detached
from
it,
to
wit,
counterfeiting
and
--
and
man
act
and
other
--
other
crimes
that
we
might
mention.
now,
i
--
i
think
we're
entitled
to
know
if
that
is
a
theory
of
the
government
and
that
if
we
can
--
if
we
can
take
it
in
that
sense
in
deciding
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
unless
those
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
answered,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you'll
hold
please,
go
ahead.
and
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'll
try
not
to
ask
you
anymore,
if
you
still
got
free
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
say
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
now,
i
put
--
i
put
one
--
one
unless
in
--
in
there
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
said,
“unless
the
prosecutor
says
now
we're
through
with
this
matter
and
we
now
go
on
to
--
to
a
matter
disassociated
from
the
order
of
the
judge
to
wit
--
to
wit,
counterfeiting.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
now,
i
won't
bother
you
anymore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
want
to
know
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wouldn't
argue
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
what
i
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
gilinsky.
mr.
lewis,
you
may
close
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
lewis.
mr.
gilinsky.
