stewart
in
other
words,
the
immunity
doesn't
attach
with
respect
to
the
questions
but
with
respect
to
the
answers.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
part
of
your
argument
also
on
this
--
on
this
phase
of
the
case,
mr.
lewis,
that
the
grand
jury
may
--
might
well
have
been
affected
by
his
demeanor
and
his
refusal
to
testify
and
by
his
conduct,
generally,
in
returning
that
indictment?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
gilinsky,
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
you
will
be
thinking
the
matters
during
the
lunch.
as
i
read
this
statute,
although
the
case
or
the
grand
jury
investigation
has
to
do
with
some
of
this
limited
narcotics
laws,
is
quite
limited
in
the
kind
of
case
in
which
immunity
can
be
conferred.
but
once
the
immunity
is
conferred,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
is
conferred
as
to
everything
that
--
that
might
incriminate
the
witness.
whether
it
be
narcotics,
about
bank
robbery,
murder
or
counterfeiting
or
vagrancy,
i'd
like
you
to
--
i
wonder
if
you
agree.
i
like
to
be
interested
in
your
answer
after
lunch.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
prosecutor
is
stupid
enough
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
that's
an
entirely
irrelevant
question
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
immunity
for
that,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
whether
it's
relevant
or
not
and
whether
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
whatever
his
understanding
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
this
is
a
grand
jury
relating
and
investigating
these
narcotics
advances,
then
any
questions
asked
by
that
grand
jury
to
which
immunity
has
been
confirmed,
he's
immune
to
the
future
controversy
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
of
the
statute
he
said
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
we're
into
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
not
thinking
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
unusual
thing
is
it
for
a
grand
jury
to
indict
--
to
subsequently
indict
one
of
the
witnesses
of
its
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
it
happens
every
time,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
argument
would
be
applicable
in
any
such
case,
wouldn't
it?
