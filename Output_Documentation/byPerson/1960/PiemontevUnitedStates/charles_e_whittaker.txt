what
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
you
--
what
you're
asking
is
that
your
argument?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gilinsky,
wouldn't
be
a
pretty
good
idea
to
--
in
determining
what
the
statute
means
to
really
look
at
the
statute?
isn't
the
statute
section
1406,
a
narcotic
statute?
deriving
that
whenever
the
judgment
of
the
u.s.
attorney
in
any
case
for
proceeding
before
a
grand
jury
involving
any
provisions
of,
then
it
refers
to
various
sections,
parts
and
chapters
that
deal
with
narcotic
drugs,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
is
necessary
to
the
public
interest,
he,
the
district
attorney,
upon
the
approval
of
attorney
generals
shall
make
application
to
the
court
that
the
witness
should
be
instructed
to
testify
or
produce
evidence.
now,
here
comes
the
phrase,
"subject
to
the
provisions
of
this
section."
now,
are
those
not
words
of
limitation
to
relevancy?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
confining
the
immunity
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
the
nature
of
the
--
of
the
grant.
