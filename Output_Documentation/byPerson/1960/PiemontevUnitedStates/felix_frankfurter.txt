then
that
he
need
an
answer
that
he
can't
be

for
any
questions,
any
answers
he
gives,
but
in
the
whole
relevance
of
the
subject
matter
as
what
is
the

is
talking
about.
the

says
the

justice

(voice

the
specific
answers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
although
questions
may
not
have
elicited,
an
answer
may
not
have
given
matter
immediately
involved
in
parties
prosecuted
for
if
it
pertains
to
the
transaction,
he
gets
immunity.
justice

not
you
would
think
so.
the
statute
says
so.
and
that's
--
that's
the
way
it's
been
--
that's
--
whether
the
ground
of
its
being
sustained
that
it
covers

of

that
--
that
is

rather
than
that
you
can't

what
he
said.
justice

what
he's

what
he
said,
oh,
what
--
that
which
he
said
leads
to.

the

justice

let
me
--
let
me
ask
you
this,
if
i
may,
in
order
to
understand
this.
the
questions
the
he
refused
to
answer
by
claiming
his
privilege,
they
were
--
they
in
the
field
of
inquiry
as
to
which
judge
campbell
then
directed
him
to
answer
all
the
questions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
answer
of
a
question
marks
the
boundaries
of
the
subject
--
the
answer
to
your
question
do
not
mark
for
me,
the
boundaries
of
the
subject
matter
within
which
he
either
answers
freely
or
if
he
doesn't
answer
freely
--
really,
he
may
be
made
to
answer
compulsory
by
getting
immunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
district
attorney
starts
out
by
saying,
i
want
to
ask
you
about
certain
narcotics
transaction
which
your
name
has
been
associated,
and
the
witness
says
that
"mr.
district
attorney
or
mr.
jones,
you
can
save
yourself
time
and
the
grand
jury's
time
and
my
time,
i'll
tell
you
now,
i'll
be
mum
on
all
questions
pertaining
to
that
subject."
and
then
he's
brought
before
the
judge
and
the
matter
is
disclosed
before
him
and
the
judge
does
or
judge
campbell
did
here.
what
--
what
lack
in
the
appropriate
procedure
is
there
in
your
view?
justice

in
the
case
in
the
lower
courts.
justice

do
you
think
the

do

think
the

answer
all
questions

the

puts
to
you
when
you're
back

go
back
with
the
grand

and
then
he
answers
all
questions,
do
you
think
the
united

government
can
thereafter
say,
"oh,
well,
we
asked
him
questions
as
to
which
his
answer
doesn't
give

it
doesn't

it
wasn't

do
you
think

you
think
that's
--
do
you
think
that's
so

real
solid
danger
of
that

justice

--
imaginary
things
that
lawyers
rightly
make

about?

any
--
justice

any
--
or
anybody
who
tenders
such
a
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
can't
shape
law,
at
least
i
--
i
don't
think
that
law
should
be
shaped
on
the
assumption
that
people
are
either
accessibly
foolish
or
accessibly
miscreated
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
hasn't
to
do
with
that
position.
it
has
to
do
with
procedures
before
a
grand
jury
and
the
normality
of
their
conduct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
district
attorney
asked
questions
about
an
area
of
subject
matter,
and
he's
blocked,
and
then
the
man
is
taken
before
the
court
and
the
court
says,
“i
decide
--
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
that
i
have,
i
decide
that
it's
important
for
you
to
be
given
immunity
than
to
be
allowed
to
stand
in
your
rights."
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
we've
held
that
he
can't
--
he
isn't
called
upon
automatically
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
means
discretion.
that
means
he
must
decide
whether
--
whether
to
grant
immunity
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
statute
was
attacked
on
the
ground
that
he
is
an
--
automatic.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nothing
that
i
said
implied
that.
if
a
man
is
before
a
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
having
the
function
that
this
court
has
described
not
so
long
ago
in
opinion
by
justice
black
and
a
--
a
witness
is
contumacious
or
refuses
to
answer
because
he
thinks
he
has
constitutional
right,
he's
then
brought
before
the
court
and
the
united
states
attorney
makes
the
presentation
and
the
judge
then
said,
“well,
i'll
grant
you
immunity,
you'll
go
back
and
answer.”
it
was
simple
and
it's
conclusive
and
comprehensive
as
all
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
gets
down
to
this.
that
when
he
first
refuses
to
stand
on
his
right,
stand
on
his
immunity,
the
u.s.
attorney
must
then
and
there
go
through
a
specific
litany
of
questions,
to
which
the
witness
refuses
to
answer.
and
then
it
goes
before
the
judge
and
says,
“yes,
you
must
answer
all
these
questions.
you
now
know
specifically
what
i'm
telling
you
to
answer
and
this
will
give
you
a
--
a
surefire
protection,
if
you're
prosecuted
for
anything
you'd
say
after
i
granted
you
immunity."
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
probably
took
a
(inaudible)
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
everything
that
he
says
after
the
compulsion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
fact,
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says
it
gives
him
immunity
with
reference
to
--
just
read
the
statute
again.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
not
going
back
to
the
statutes
if
one
deals
with
it.
what
does
that
statute
--
what
are
--
what
are
the
--
what
is
the
scope
of
the
immunity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
judge
told
them,
"you
talk
--
you
disclose
everything
they
asked
you
about
narcotics,"
therefore,
he
gets
immunity,
so
far
as
i
can
see
about
anything
that
touches
prosecutions
for
narcotics,
if
any
provision
of
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
lewis,
these
cases
--
that's
when
the
practical,
in
the
real
world
instead
of
what
i
call
(inaudible).
these
cases
arise
when
the
witness
starts
the
questioning
almost
at
the
threshold
usually.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
these
things
arise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
what
is
the
judge
confronted
with?
according
to
your
view,
he
would
simply
compel
the
witness
to
say,
"you
go
back
and
answer
the
question,
that
one
question
which
--
by
which
you
go
for
all
further
questions."
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
subject
matter
did
they
relate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
so
he
gets
immunity
for
everything
that
thereafter
he
says
about
narcotics.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
your
argument
really
comes
down
to
this.
that
you
can
conceive
that
there
maybe
some
judges,
among
the
hundreds
or
the
more
hundreds
that
we'll
have
assume,
in
the
land,
but
there
maybe
among
those
hundreds
of
judges,
it's
conceivable
that
there
maybe
some
judge
or
judges
who
would
do
something
that
you
can't
conceive
that
this
court
would
approve
of.
that's
what
your
argument
comes
down.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
they
--
when
we
asked
stenographic
minutes
of
juries,
an
application
for
the
disclosures
come
like
fallen
leaves
in
autumn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suggest
where
a
remark
of
justice
holmes
in
his
opinion
for
the
court,
a
man
who
wants
to
keep
within
the
law
if
they
have
no
difficulty
in
a
situation
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
yes,
he
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
--
that's
why
we
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
an
unwilling
customer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
--
the
interstate
commerce
goes
back
to
the
1980s
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
slipped
in
--
i
don't
mean,
you
just
inserted
a
phrase,
“if
the
government
thinks
it's
relevant.”
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
because
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
after
all,
judge
campbell
and
no
other
judge
normally,
when
--
when
wasn't
assumed
irrational
judges,
but
there
maybe
such
or
irrational
moments,
the
judge
was
specific
as
to
what
he
compel
answers
from
which
the
compulsion
leading
to
immunity
by
virtue
of
a
statute,
which
is
a
restrictive
statute.
congress
has
again
and
again
refused
a
general
immunity
statute.
it
has
passed
ad
hoc
immunity
statutes,
beginning
with
the
case
that
came
up
at
the
provision
of
18
--
whatever
it
was
in
brown
against
--
that
was
sustaining
brown
against
walker.
justice
felix
frankfurter
step
by
step
and
even
today,
there
are
very
few,
so
that
the
grant
of
immunity
is
limited
by
congressional
command,
by
congressional
direction
to
specific
crimes.
and
the
judge
grants
immunity
by
enumerating
it
in
this
case,
to
what
subject
matter
the
grant
for
what
subject
matter
--
the
grant
to
what
subject
matter
the
grant
applies.
and
presumably,
it's
one
thing
as
you
said
a
minute
ago,
if
the
district
attorney
considering
the
latitude
one
has
as
to
relevance
particularly
before
a
grand
jury
in
determining
what
is
relevant,
certainly,
if
--
if
he
thinks
that.
but
if
he
goes
on
a
joyride
of
his
own
and
suddenly
takes
it
into
his
head
to
be
asking
him
about
the
man
act
in
a
narcotics
--
in
the
jury
court
for
narcotics
inquiries
are
restricted
to
that,
you
got
a
different
problem.
in
that
way,
you
mustn't
assume
(a)
that
the
u.s.
attorney
would
travel
outside
of
the
framework
of
that
which
grants
immunity,
(b)
that
a
witness
doesn't
know
that
he's
traveling
outside
as
in
this
case,
where
he's
given
a
whole
day
until
he's
asked
to
return
to
the
grand
jury
to
consult
with
his
lawyer.
and
(c)
that
court
would
act
on
it.
all
of
those,
this
is
the
house
the
judge
built,
would
have
to
be
involved
in
order
to
find
and
in
order
to
conclude
that
when
quite
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
allowed
immunity,
a
strange
u.s.
attorney
does
the
kind
of
a
plea
that
you
interpreted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
decide
which
case
and
not
allow
the
strange
hypothesis.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
authorized
to
make
this
concession
for
the
government?
i'd
like
you
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
before
you
get
through,
because
you're
thriving
on
very
dangerous
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
quite
outside
what
i
believe,
can
be
the
authorized
the
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
let
me
put
this
case
to
you.
let's
test
these
things.
the
first
phrase
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
arriving
from
talking
about
the
statute-conferred
immunity.
the
statute
doesn't
confer
immunity.
the
statute
authorizes
a
judge.it
gives
him
certain
powers.
therefore,
we
are
dealing
with
jurisdiction
in
the
ultimate
sense
of
the
term,
"power".
let
me
put
to
this
question,
suppose
the
judge
was
brought
before
him
this
defendant,
says
“while
we're
about
it,
i
know
this
grand
jury
is
at
large.
it
isn't
called
just
to
deal
with
narcotics.
i
know
that
it's
also
investigating
a
counterfeiting
ring.”
and
therefore,
while
we're
about
it,
i
tell
you
if
the
district
attorney,
when
he
gets
through
with
narcotics
question
or
when
he
wants
to
play
another
question,
while
he
talks
about
narcotic
matters,
asked
you
about
counterfeiting.
i
instruct
you
now
to
answer
those
questions
too
and
i
grant
you
immunity.
would
he
have
immunity
for
those
counterfeiting
problems?
has
the
judge
power
to
grant
him
immunity
for
counterfeiting
your
offenses?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
read
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
statute
is
confined
by
--
the
statute
enumerates
the
provisions
of
the
law
under
which
immunity
is
granted.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
well
that
what
is
relevant
that
if
a
district
attorney
on
his
conscience
and
none
for
his
duty,
deems
a
question
relevant
considering
the
scope
we've
given
the
grand
jury
investigation
and
the
hearsay
and
all
the
rest.
i
can
well
understand
and
that
i
well
understand,
i
agree
that
if
the
district
attorney
thinks
the
question
is
relevant,
we
aren't
going
to
test
this
in
another
case.
but
if
the
district
attorney
travels
outside
of
the
orbit
of
the
subject
matter
for
which
the
judge
is
authorized
to
give
immunity,
he
can't
give
immunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
said
and
i
do
not
say
that
if
a
district
attorney
asked
him
a
question
that
appears
on
the
face
that
irrelevant
this
could
be
that
we
should
sit
here
and
assume
that
the
district
attorney
is
going
to
be
either
ignorant
of
or
in
defiance
of
what
the
judges
just
ordered.
namely
that
he
must
keep
within
the
framework
of
narcotics
question
and
i'm
not
going
to
sit
here
to
decide
whether
in
fact,
what
he
asked
was
relevant.
i
presumed
that
when
a
u.s.
attorney
asked
a
question,
he's
asking
a
question
in
accordance
with
law
and
it
would
be
not
in
accordance
with
law
to
compel
an
answer
outside
of
narcotics
legislation
because
that's
the
only
basis
on
which
immunity
could
have
been
given
by
a
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
--
but
if
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
answers
the
common
--
if
he
answers
the
common
inquiry
regarding
counterfeiting,
i'm
now
through
with
the
narcotics.
i'm
now
going
to
the
question
of
counterfeiting,
having
nothing
to
do
with
narcotics.
the
judge
below
told
you,
you
shouldn't
answer
any
question
because
you
got
immunity.
and
i
say,
neither
this
court
nor
any
other
court
could
grant
immunity
for
counterfeiting,
because
congress
hasn't
given
that
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
anything
more
--
are
you
saying
anything
more
--it
was
a
rather
this
long
discussion
and
a
lot
of
supposition
far
removed
from
this
case
that
can
be,
are
you
saying
anything
more
that
the
questions
of
the
prosecutor
are
presumably
restricted
to
the
subject
matter
on
the
affidavit
of
which
is
approved
by
attorney
general,
they
go
before
the
court
and
grant
--
and
get
compulsory
process
that
aren't
you
--
are
you
saying
anymore
that
the
relevancy
of
his
questions
are
not
to
be
subsequently
reexamined
de
novo
by
an
outside
tribunal?
are
you
saying
anything
more
than
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
says
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
through
with
narcotics,
i'm
now
going
to
counterfeiting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
the
judge
said
you
must
answer
everything
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
a
wholly
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
--
you
couldn't
explain
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
is
where
you
explain.
we
understood
the
chief
justice's
question
was
and
i
may
have
misunderstood
that
the
district
attorney,
the
u.s.
attorney
asked
him
a
lot
of
question
and
that
--
then
now,
he
says
as
you've
heard

in
the

justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mind
repeating
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
he
must
use
the
very
words,
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
very
words,
that
unless
it's
--
although
it's
clear
to
everybody
that
he's
through
with
counterfeiting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
although
he
doesn't
say
the
words
that
he
has
immunity
for
everything,
although
plainly
enough,
every
grand
juror
would
know,
the
witness
would
know,
everybody
would
know
he's
going
off
into
different
territories.
because
he
hasn't
said
--
as
they
said
it
in
the
17th
century,
volunteered
so,
unless
you
said,
now,
mr.
witness,
i
want
you
to
know
because
you
would
know
otherwise,
but
i
must
tell
you
in
words
that
i'm
not
going
often
to
other
territory.
that
makes
the
crucial
difference,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
would
be
intense
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
requires
--
it
requires
this
order
of
the
court
before
immunity
could
go
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
is
the
court
that
must
enter
this
order.
and
it
is
the
court
that
must
be
satisfied
the
conditions
in
the
statute
as
satisfied.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
doesn't
give
him
immunity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
just
words,
aren't
they?
is
it
your
words
or
my
words?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
saying
--
what
i've
just
said
is
that
it's
a
--
a
statute
that
empowers
judicial
action
and
defines
the
scope
within
which
the
court
must
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
say
that
he
must
have
a
red
--
a
red
band
rather
than
a
blue
band
or
covering
the
paper
or
a
seal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it
is
--
it
requires
the
adjudication
of
a
constitutional
court
to
bring
this
about.
