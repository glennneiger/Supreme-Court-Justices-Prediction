justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
lewis,
but
i
don't
follow
you.
what
is
it
that
you
say
is
a
prerequisite
before
there
may
be
a
grant
of
immunity
that
there
must
be
some
questions
asked
to
him
which
he
does
what?
he
must
answer
them
before?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
follow
this.
you
mean
--
let's
see.
before
the
grand
jury,
and
he's
taken
the
privilege
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
he
comes
back
before
the
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
the
court
repeats
the
questions,
he
refuses
to
answer
them,
isn't
that
stage
that
an
order
of
immunity,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn't
think
i'm
in
the
verdict.
i
thought
i
was
in
the
same
area.(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
there
a
form
of
order
entered
here
by
judge
campbell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
what
page
is
that
at?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
does
that
make
reference
to
the
immunity
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
i'm
not
sure
whether
you
can
answer
this
as
a
general
practice,
but
that
was
the
same
form
of
order
that
was
in
reina.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
can
see
that.
if
i
get
you
correctly,
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
must
be
directed
to
answer
specific
questions
which
would
call
for
particular
answers,
and
that
if
gives
those
answers,
then,
by
reasons
of
those
answers,
he
may
not
be
prosecuted
that
be
relied
upon
the
immunity
in
giving
them.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
so
that
what
you
are
saying
is
that
there
must
be
specific
questions
as
to
which
he
is
told,
"you
go
back
and
answer
and
as
to
answer
--
any
answers
you
give
to
those
particular
questions,
you
have
immunity,"
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
there
must
be
a
--
there
must
be
a
particular
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
support
you
have
for
that
particular
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
what
in
the
statute
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
--
what
is
it
in
the
statute
that
supports
that
interpretation
that
there
must
be
a
particular
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
otherwise,
he
runs
the
risk
because
it
may
be
said
that
his
testimony
was
voluntarily
given,
unless
his
testimony
addressed
to
some
particular
question
which
he
was
ordered
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
happening
to
this
though
i
gather,
mr.
lewis,
if
an
order
generally
to
answer
questions
has
the
effect
of
--
the
statute
has
the
effect
of
granting
immunity
as
to
answers
to
all
questions
asked.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
as
i
gather
what
judge
campbell
did
was
--
say,
"you
go
back
and
answer
all
the
questions
put
to
you."
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
and
you'll
have
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
now,
the
statute
is
to
be
interpreted
in
that
context
as
meaning
that
he
then
may
not
be
prosecuted
in
respect
of
any
answers
he
gives
to
any
questions
in
obedience
to
the
order
to
get
back
and
answer
all
questions,
then
what
is
there
of
your
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
it
the
order
under
which
he
--
at
the
time
he
went
back,
i
mean
those
questions
were
asked
of
him,
there
was
a
general
order
to
get
back
and
answer
all
questions,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
gilinsky?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
colloquy
followed
the
entry
of
the
order,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they're
both
dated

suppose
the
question
whether

rob
a
bank
in
order
to
buy
narcotics.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
answer
to
your
--
at
the
start
of
your
questions
affecting
the
facts
