justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
precisely
what
the
court
told
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
on
page
60,
concerning
the
matter
of
their
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
it
already
appeared
in
the
record
what
was
the
matter
of
investigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
your
argument
somewhat
similar
to
the
argument
that
frequently
made
with
reference
to
the
specificity
of
an
indictment
in
order
to
afford
the
man
a
proper
opportunity
to
plead
double
jeopardy?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
must
be
on
some
kind
of
an
order
which
will
give
him
complete
protection
on
any
question
they
asked
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
on
that
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
see
your
objection
if
he
had
said,
"go
back
and
answer
everything
they
asked
you,"
that
--
unless
we
would
hold
which
perhaps
many
courts
would
be
inclined
to
hold.
that
if
the
--
certainly,
if
--
if
it
would
put
on
the
basis,
go
back
and
answer
any
question
and
didn't
make
any
difference
what's
related
to
it
or
not.
they'd
say
that
you
had
a
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice

community
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
anything
they
asked
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
understand
your
apprehension.
if
it's
true
that
the
courts
would
say
that
after
a
judge
told
a
man,
go
back
and
answer
anything
they
ask,
you
could
construe
to
believe
the
courts
would
say
that
the
government
can
go
back
on
that
thereafter
and
do
something
to
him
for
some
of
those
questions.
i
--
i
can't
concede
that
the
court
would
hold
the
statute
to
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
i
can
conceive
that
this
court
would
ever
hold
after
statement
like
that
has
been
made
to
a
man,
go
back,
the
judge
tells
him
to
go
back
and
answer
anything
he's
asked,
if
i
could
conceive
that
this
court
would
ever
hold,
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
was
immune
from
prosecution
by
anything
in
the
world
to
ask
him
about
any
subject
for
--
in
that
city,
then
i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
--
there
should
be
some
specific
thing
like
an
indictment
to
tell
him
exactly
the
scope
of
it.
i
can't
conceive
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
court
would
hold
that.
i
hope
it
wouldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this.
suppose
they
had
asked
him,
in
the
grand
jury,
about
stealing
something,
that
he
had
confessed
to
it,
and
he
had
been
indicted
for
the
stealing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
had
been
indicted
for
the
stealing,
do
you
think
he
had
immunity
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
it
went
back
right
straight
to
the
grand
jury
and
they
asked
him
if
he
had
been
stealing
something.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
it
was
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
something
else
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
he
had
been
directed
by
the
judge
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he
--
how
would
he
know
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
is
a
problem
--
it's
a
problem,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
with
reference
to
what
kind
of
a
--
how
specific
this
must
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
understand
the
government
is
taking
the
position
that
they
could
get
him
in
there
and
ask
him
other
questions
about
other
things,
which
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
he
had
--
he'd
had
to
have
a
legal
knowledge
enough
to
know
that
he
had
--
didn't
have
immunity
with
that
then
that
raises
a
problem
in
my
mind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
interested
in
the
general
problem.
what
i
wanted
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
i
understand
that
you're
taking
the
position,
they
could
get
him
in
there
if
he'd
been
directed
to
answer
all
questions
asked.
and
that
the
government
would
take
the
position
that
you
didn't
have
immunity
because
they
were
not
closely
enough
related
to
narcotics?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
--
i
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
mean
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
grant
him
immunity
from
the
bank
robbery,
unless
they
asked
him
about
it
after
they
told
him
to
go
answer
all
the
questions
that
were
asked.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
say
(c)
that
i
hope
you
stick
to
what
you
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
question
on
grant.
suppose
the
judge
had
send
him
in
there
and
said
you
answer
any
question
that's
asked
and
you
say
that
he
would
not
get
immunity
if
the
--
the
lawyer
says
this
has
no
connection
with
it.
would
you
think
that
the
statute
would
--
which
was
held,
the
statute
would
then
grant
him
the
complete
immunity
that
it
has
to
grant
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
mean
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
make
an
immunity
statute
that
resorts
to
compel
a
man
top
answer
a
question,
it
must
be
a
complete
one
that's
been
held.
and
suppose
the
judge
tell
him
to
go
and
answer
any
question
they
ask,
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
district
attorney
makes
that
--
that
explanatory
speech
that
you're
talking
about
and
asked
him
a
question
and
he
answered
it.
do
you
think
that
on
immunity
statute
would
be
a
complete
immunity,
if
he
had
it
disobey
what
the
judge
told
him
to
do
and
get
an
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
i'm
talking
about
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
judge
has
granted
power
to
grant
him
immunity.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
--
the
statute
--
the
statute
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whatever
the
--
whatever
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
he
made
it
so
general
then
that
he
said
in
a
question?
that
comes
to
this
argument
that's
been
made,
if
you
are
saying
it,
when
he
makes
it
that
general.
a
man
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
man
could
--
wouldn't
get
immunity,
then
you
are
saying
that
they
couldn't
try
out
to
compel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
only
one
specific
enough.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
the
witness
would
have
to
be
clairvoyant
enough
to
file
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
whether
the
district
attorney
thought
it
is
relevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
--
of
course
you
know
that
there
have
been
occasions
when
there
was
a
little
slip
on
that
field
and
they
were
not
relevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
a
lot
more
and
i
thought
i
heard
you
say.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
sentence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
