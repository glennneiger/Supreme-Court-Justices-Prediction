mr.
melvin
b.lewis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
on
--
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
--
and
on
the
grant
of
that
petition,
the
writ
of
certiorari
issuing
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
we
here
invoked
the
general
supervisory
powers
vested
in
your
honors
and
hope
likewise
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
to
your
honors
a
very
serious
constitutional
deficiency
in
the
proceedings
below,
which
we
trust
will
merit
your
honors'
consideration.
at
the
inception
of
the
litigation
in
about
august
of
1959,
the
petitioner,
armando
piemonte,
was
in
federal
custody
serving
a
six-year
sentence
for
the
sale
of
narcotics.
he
was
brought
in
from
his
place
of
confinement
where
he
was
lodged
pursuant
to
final
mittimus.
the
proceedings
consequent
upon
his
being
brought
in,
have
to
be
somewhat
interpolated
from
the
record,
but
are,
nonetheless,
i
think,
quite
plain.
giving
them
chronologically,
he
had
a
conference
with
the
prosecutor
who
had
caused
him
to
be
brought
there,
a
special
attorney
of
the
department
of
justice,
special
agent,
i
believe,
he's
referred
to
some
places
in
the
record.
he
asked
to
the
prosecutor
that
he'd
be
allowed
to
call
a
lawyer.
the
lawyer
was
indeed
called
and
the
--
and
he
--
as
--
the
lawyer
spoke
with
the
prosecutor
who
arranged
for
him
to
see
the
defendant.
there
was
a
conference
between
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
following
which
the
defendant,
then
theoretically
a
witness,
was
called
before
the
grand
jury
as
a
--
as
a
witness.
he
claimed
self-incrimination
as
to
the
various
questions
propounded
to
him,
which,
i
think,
painted
broadly,
could
be
said
to
deal
with
the
general
subject
of
narcotics.
the
prosecutor
engaged
in
a
colloquy
at
that
time
with
the
defendant
in
which
he
intimated
--
read
it
strongly
to
the
defendant
that
there
was
no
area
of
privilege
with
reference
to
his
being
asked
where
he
had
obtained
the
narcotics
for
whose
sale
he
was
then
serving
a
sentence.
the
defendant
said
something
to
the
effect
that
he
hadn't
understood
everything
that
his
lawyer
had
told
him,
but
that
--
well,
i
think
to
quote
him
directly,
“i
ain't
answering
no
questions,"
or
words
to
that
effect.
he,
thereupon,
persisted
in
his
refusal
and
was
brought
back
before
the
court.
in
the
proceedings
before
the
court,
which
occurred
some
days
subsequent
to
his
grand
jury
appearance,
the
lawyer,
whose
identity
was,
of
course,
known
to
the
prosecutor,
who
--
and
who
had,
in
fact,
spoken
with
the
prosecutor
on
a
prior
occasion,
was
not
called
or
notified
so
far
as
the
record
discloses.
the
defendant
was
brought
before
the
court
and
they
--
there
held
a
hearing
in
which
he
was
not
represented.
the
prosecutor
at
this
time
advised
the
court
that
lest
there
should
be
any
questions,
he
was
desirous
that
the
court
should
know
that
based
upon
some
recent
decisions
of
the
appellate
court,
as
he
phrased
it,
he
now
felt
that
the
petitioner's
constitutional
claim
of
privilege
was
proper
as
to
all
questions
propounded
to
him,
including
those
relating
to
the
prior
conviction.
the
court,
in
his
response,
expressed
doubt
as
to
whether
the
constitutional
immunity
would
apply
in
that
aspect
but
agreed
that
as
to
all
the
remaining
questions,
the
constitutional
claim
of
privilege
was
indeed
proper.
the
court,
thereupon,
advised
the
defendant
that
in
--
herewith,
granted
him
immunity,
that
it
was,
therefore,
no
longer
necessary
for
him
to
claim
possible
self-incrimination
and
it
directed
that
he
be
required
to
answer
the
questions.
i
would've
--
i
would
like
to
depart
from
my
factual
presentation
to
urge
the
court
at
this
particular
time
so
that
the
rest
of
the
statements
would
be
framed
in
their
proper
context,
that
there
never
was
a
direction
to
the
defendant
at
any
stage
that
he
answer
any
specific
question.
he
was
told
rather
to
answer
--
the
--
the
most
frequently
recurring
phrase
is,
"answer
the
questions
propounded
to
you".
and
i
think
it
could
be
argued
equally
well
on
the
face
of
this
record
that
he
was
ordered
to
answer
such
questions
as
might
in
the
future
be
propounded
to
him
or
such
questions
as
might,
in
the
past,
have
been
propounded
to
him.
the
significance
of
the
distinction
there
is
something
that
i
will
come
to
later,
but
i
think
at
this
point,
i
think
it
is
not
inappropriate
to
observe
to
your
honors
that
the
point
never
did
come
where
the
petitioner
was
told,
"answer
this
specific
question,"
by
the
court.
now,
piemonte,
at
this
time,
the
--
the
petitioner
when
he
--
when
the
court
told
him
that
he
was
granted
immunity,
that
he
no
longer
had
to
worry
about
self-incrimination
and
that
he
ought,
therefore,
answer
questions.
he
asked
if
he
might
be
permitted
to
talk
to
his
lawyer
and
the
court
said
that
indeed,
he
could,
and
that
the
grand
jury
should
not
further
interrogate
the
petitioner
until
he
had
seen
his
lawyer
and
the
court
further
observed
that
the
petitioner
would
be
represented
by
counsel
and
upon
hearing
held
prior
to
the
imposition
of
any
penalty.
however,
at
this
time,
the
--
i
--
i
don't
believe
that
there
could
be
any
possible
tenable
theory
by
which
the
defendant
was,
in
fact,
in
contempt
at
this
stage.
the
next
procedural
development
was
the
entry
of
a
written
order.
the
written
order
is
not
shown
to
have
been
brought
to
the
petitioner's
attention
in
any
manner.
i
think
i
may
fairly
state
to
this
court
that
all
of
the
record
inferences
are
against
it,
but
we
needn't
go
that
far
because
of
the
fact
that
the
--
the
burden,
i
think,
being
concededly
upon
the
prosecution
to
sustain
all
elements
of
criminal
contempt
in
this
way.
the
least
we
can
say
is
that
there
is
no
showing
that,
in
fact,
it
was
brought
to
his
attention.
the
order
does
--
again,
this
written
order
does
not
direct
answers
to
specific
questions
but
rather
states
that
the
defendant,
and
i
believe,
i'm
fairly
well
quoting
it,
that
the
defendant
shall
not
be
excused
from
testifying
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
or
any
evidence
presented
by
him,
may
tend
to
incriminate
him
but
that
he
shall
answer
the
questions
propounded
to
him,
again,
the
recurring
phrase.
the
defendant
was
then
brought
back
before
the
grand
jury,
and
he
was
reminded
that
the
--
by
the
prosecutor
that
the
judge
had
--
as
the
prosecutor
phrased
it,
"granted
you
immunity
and
ordered
you
to
answer
questions
in,"
--
generally,
i
think
the
prosecutor's
phrase
was
concerning
narcotics.
the
response
of
the
--
the
petitioner
was,
"i
stand
on
the
fifth
amendment."
and
the
prosecutor
said,
"well,
he's
going
to
go
ahead
anyhow,"
and
asked
the
questions
on
which
the
privilege
had
been
claimed
and
repeats
them
to
the
petitioner.
and
he
proceeded
--
substantially
to
do
that,
he
added,
for
the
first
time
in
the
second
grand
jury
presentations,
questions
concerning
two
persons,
nathaniel
spurlock
and
jeremiah
pullings.
pullings
will
appear
later
in
the
presentation
as
a
codefendant
with
the
petitioner
on
the
indictment
subsequently
returned
against
the
petitioner
by
that
same
grand
jury.
the
petitioner
stood
by
his
refusal
to
answer
questions.
a
rule
to
show
cause
was
entered
against
him.
his
lawyer
was
present.
he
persisted
in
his
refusal
to
answer
questions.
he
asked
the
--
where
jury
to
demand
was
refused,
the
hearing
--
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
the
rule.
the
government
rested
on
the
transcript
in
the
case.
the
defendant
testified
that
the
basis
for
his
refusal
to
answer
questions
that
the
--
the
real
reason
why
he
wouldn't
answer
was
fear
of
underworld
retaliation.
and
after
some
colloquy
between
the
court
and
prosecuting
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not,
six
months
were
the
maximum
permissive
sentence,
he
was
sentenced
to
a
period
of
18
months
on
the
assurance
of
the
special
agent
for
the
department
of
justice
that
he
had
himself
been
party
to
proceedings
wherein
sentences
of
that
nature
had,
in
the
past,
been
approved.
on
august
27th,
some
nine
days
following
the
sentence,
the
petitioner
filed
his
notice
of
appeal.
five
or
six
days
after
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
appeal,
there
was
return
of
an
indictment
by
the
same
grand
jury
before
which
he
had
declined
to
testify
the
indictment
charged
the
petitioner
here
and
the
gentleman,
pullings,
who,
i
mentioned
before,
i
used
the
term
"gentleman"
not
in
an
analytic
sense,
but
rather
i
--
i
don't
know
the
man,
and
it
seems
in
--
in
problems
that
i
should
do
otherwise.
the
indictment
was
returned.
it
was
subsequently
tried
and
the
government
has
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
in
this
case
in
which
it
indicates
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
here
was
found
not
guilty
on
that
trial.
i
suppose
that
the
government
will
probably
explain
to
the
court
what
the
relevance
of
the
not
guilty
is,
but
we
have
certain
submissions
to
make
predicated
upon
the
indictment
itself.
now,
we
complained
to
your
honors
first
and
--
and
addressed
ourselves
to
you
your
honors'
general
supervisory
power
and
suggest
that
the
summary
nature
of
these
proceedings,
the
speed,
the
mechanical
nature
of
the
processing,
almost
as
though
they
were
--
were
gears
grinding
through
the
--
the
courtroom
was
of
such
a
nature
that
it
really
will
not
support
the
contempt
adjudication
that
was
predicated
on
--
on
it.
i
would
remind
your
honors
that
the
defendant
was
hold
from
the
penitentiary
to
the
courthouse
that
he
was
given
a
--
a
hearing
at
which
no
lawyer
was
present,
even
though
the
identity
of
his
lawyer
was
known
to
the
prosecutor.
the
issue
of
the
confusion
relative
to
the
prior
conviction
can
only
have
served
to
convince
the
defendants
that
he
was
as
well
of
keeping
his
own
counsel
as
that
of
the
persons
who
undertook
to
advise
him
both
at
his
request
and
--
at
--
those
who
undertook
to
advise
him
sua
sponte,
so
to
speak,
and
certainly
with
unsolicited
advice.
in
that
area,
i
--
i
would
like
to
make
myself
clear
particularly
in
view
of
ceratin
language
contained
in
the
piemonte
--
pardon
me,
in
the
--
in
the
reina
decision
recently
issued
by
this
court.
giacomo
reina,
i
believe,
is
the
name
of
the
case.
in
that
case,
a
question
arose
as
to
whether
immunity
would
properly
extend
to
questions
relating
to
the
prior
conviction
of
a
defendant
called
before
a
grand
jury.
there
is
--
as
your
honors
there
indicated,
very
waivy
authority
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
immunity
in
that
specific
area.
but
that
is
--
that
is
something
of
no
application
to
this
particular
case.
in
reina,
as
i
read
the
decision,
the
defendant
would
have
been
convicted,
i
believe,
of
the
sale
of
narcotics.
he
was
asked
essentially
something
to
the
effect
of
to
whom
he
had
sold
it,
a
matter
directly
related
to
the
conviction
and
encompass
completely
therein.
there,
the
--
the
question
of
whether
he
had
any
immunity
remaining
as
to
that
aspect
of
the
thing
is
quite
beside
the
point
here.
for
here,
the
petitioner
was
asked
something
vastly
different.
he
was
asked
where
he
had
obtained
the
heroin
for
whose
sale.
he
had
thereafter
been
convicted.
the
purchase
of
the
heroin,
the
--
it
--
and
its
subsequent
possession
and
so
forth,
presents
offenses
quite
distinct
from
the
sale
of
it.
and
offenses
which
might
well
have
been
punished
by
cumulative
sentencing.
so
that
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
being
convicted
of
sale
does
not
deprive
a
man
of
any
constitutional
immunity
that
he
otherwise
possesses
relative
to
his
acquisition
of
that
heroin
for
which
he
can
be
quite
separately
and
additionally
punished.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
indeed
there
was.
indeed
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
indeed
there
was,
your
honor,
in
our
review.
the
--
in
fact,
we
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
--
and
to
the
court
that
the
question
is
not
really
whether
there
--
so
much
whether
there
was
a
--
a
defect
in
the
grant
of
immunity.
i
believe
firmly
that
there
was.
but
rather
whether
the
proceedings
below
where
characterized
by
such
procedural
regularity
as
to
support
a
contempt
adjudication.
in
other
words,
we
--
we
would
urge,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
it
--
it
need
not
necessarily
be
one
or
the
other.
the
--
the
proceedings
--
it
just
doesn't
follow
as
an
ironclad
rule
that
if
the
proceedings
are
sufficiently
regular
to
have
conferred
immunity
at
a
subsequent
stage,
they
are
necessarily
sufficiently
regular
to
support
a
contempt
adjudication.
that
surely
there
is
a
--
a
shadow
area
where
giving
the
benefit
to
the
defendant
under
the
--
such
a
statute.
he
might
very
well
be
held
subsequently
to
have
been
giving
immunity,
but
yet,
the
proceedings
sufficiently
irregular
as
not
to
support
a
contempt
adjudication.
we
submit
--
we
suggest
to
your
honors
here
though,
with
reference
to
this
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
pardon
me.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
allude
your
--
your
honor
to
this.
the
statute
requires,
in
order
that
a
grant
of
immunity
be
consequent
upon
one's
appearance
before
a
grand
jury
or
a
court,
the
following
steps.
first,
the
witness,
as
he
is
termed
at
that
point,
the
--
the
witness
must
be
--
must
receive
--
there
must
be
propounded
to
him
one
or
more
questions
which
he
refuses
to
answer
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
may
tend
to
incriminate
him.
secondly,
sir,
he
must
be
brought
before
the
court
and
such
one
or
more
questions,
as
the
court
of
appeals
he
ought
properly
to
answer,
are
then
certified
as
questions
which
he
must
answer.
upon
his
answering
those
questions,
he
acquires
immunity,
once
that
procedure
is
followed.
now,
of
course,
it
requires
certain
ancillary
procedure
as
well.
there
must
be
a
proper
petition
presented
by
the
prosecution
and
the
--
the
court
must
make
certain
basic
findings.
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
the
immunity
statute,
as
written,
will
not
support
a
general
direction
to
a
defendant
to
answer
questions,
just
go
answer
questions.
this
is
the
one
thing
that
cannot,
i
think,
properly
be
tolerated
under
a
statute.
and
the
reason
for
my
saying
that,
if
it
please
your
honors,
is
that
where
a
defendant
is
called
upon
subsequently
to
assert
his
immunity,
acquired
in
the
course
of
these
proceedings,
as
against
a
subsequent
indictment
of
one
sort
or
another,
it
--
it
necessarily
be
--
divulge
upon
him
as
a
burden
to
show
that
the
immunity,
in
fact,
attached
in
pursuance
of
the
statute
which
we
are
here
contemplating.
in
order
that
he
might
show
this,
it
must
be
necessary
that
he
be
prepared
to
show
that
he
was
directed
to
answer
a
certain
specific
question
relating
to
the
subject
matter
of
his
subsequent
indictment.
he
must
also,
i
suppose,
show
how
--
what
the
connection
is,
and
there's
really
quite
a
substantial
burden
imposed
upon
him
in
that
area.
but
it's
a
--
it's
a
burden
which,
however
--
however,
the
light
it
maybe
attached
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
no,
your
--
oh,
yes,
yes.
the
answering
of
the
question
is
a
condition
precedent
to
the
grant
of
immunity,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
no,
your
honor.
the
order
which
is
entered
at
that
stage
provides
that
immunity
shall
be
consequent
upon
any
answer
given
to
--
by
him
to
--
to
that
question
in
the
proper
forum.
i
wonder
if
that
explains
it
somewhat
better
if
i
might
divert
from
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
just
long
any
enough
to
--
to
answer
it.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
you
are,
your
--
your
honor,
very
substantially.
the
immunity
does
not
attach
until
the
witness
testifies.
until
he
actually
answers
a
question,
he
acquires
no
immunity
whatever
under
this
statute.
the
only
purpose,
the
function
served
by
the
court's
order
is
to
energize
the
immunity
statute
in
such
manner
that
his
answers
to
the
questions
which
he
is
directed
to
answer
will
confer
immunity.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
there
was
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
the
court
will
indulge
me
for
a
second,
judge
campbell
entered
two
orders,
but
the
order
directing
that
the
--
that
the
defendant
answer
questions
appears
at
page
12
and
13
of
the
record,
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
no,
your
honor.
it
does
--
it
--
well,
pardon
me.
it
makes
reference
to
it,
yes.
it
cites
the
immunity
statute
and
says
--
the
exact
words
are,
“this
order
is
--
is
made
in
accordance
with
18
u.s.c.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
believe
it's
probably
is,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that
the
majority
of
these
orders
are
prepared,
if
--
if
i
may
stretch
my
limited
knowledge
of
this
matter,
by
very
much
the
same
small
group
of
people.
it's
the
same
form
of
order
which
is
--
which
was
prepared
in
reina
perhaps.
i
--
i
may
--
that
--
that
may
very
well
be.
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
we
are
making
a
contention
with
reference
to
that
order,
which
i
do
not
believe
was,
in
any
way,
presented
by
reina.
and
--
and
what
we
are
urging
to
your
honors
is
this.
no
immunity
attaches
until
the
defendant,
in
fact,
answers
the
questions.
now,
in
order
for
him
to
assert
his
immunity
at
a
subsequent
stage,
he
must
show
--
the
burden
will
be
on
him
to
show,
first,
that
he
went
before
the
court
or
grand
jury
and
that
he
claimed
constitutional
immunity
with
reference
to
that
question.
secondly,
that
he
was,
thereafter,
ordered
to
answer
the
question
over
his
claim
of
constitutional
immunity.
third,
that
the
question
was
then
a
game
propounded
to
him
in
pursuance
of
the
court
order
entered
in
--
under
the
statute,
and
that
he,
thereupon,
answered
it.
and
fourth,
he
must
show
that
his
answer
relates
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
subsequent
criminal
accusation
made
against
him.
now,
it
is
--
for
that
reason,
mr.
justice
brennan,
that
i
earnestly
urge
to
--
upon
this
court
the
proposition
that
a
general
direction
to
a
witness,
"go
answer
questions",
will
not
properly
energize
the
immunity
statute
with
which
we
are
here
dealing.
and
the
reason
that
that
is
so
very
fundamentally
true
is
because
of
the
fact
that
the
immunity
will
attach
only
under
the
terms
of
the
statute
to
such
questions
as
have
been
asked
without
reference
to
the
immunity
statute,
which
the
witness
has
refused
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
possible
self-incrimination
and
which,
thereafter,
if
--
if
it
please
the
court,
he
is
directed
specifically
to
answer
and
then
answers.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
that
is
correct,
sir.
absolutely.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
i
don't
know
if
i've
understood
you
properly,
your
honor,
but
i
would
--
i
would
revise
that
statement
somewhat.
the
questions
need
not
call
for
specific
answers
if
i
--
i
mean
there
--
but
i
thought
you
were
telling
is
that
or
maybe
you're
not.
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
the
statute
cannot
be
affected
to
grant
immunity
if
all
that
the
judge
says
is,
"you
go
back
and
answer
all
questions
that
are
put
to
you
by
the
grand
jury
in
connection
with
its
inquiry,
and
as
to
every
answer
that
you
may
give
to
any
questions,"
and
i
don't
know
what
the
questions
are
going
to
be
asked
that
as
--
"any
answers
you
might
give,
the
statute
gives
you
immunity."
you
say
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
that
cannot
be
done.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
that
is
correct.
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart,
precisely.
the
--
the
court
does
not
itself
give
immunity.
the
immunity
is
--
is
conferred
by
the
act
of
answering.
now,
if
i
--
i
just
going
to
clear
up
one
possible
area
of
misapprehension
here.
i
don't
want
to
import
to
this
court
that
there
must
be
a
specific
answer
that
--
given
in
order
to
get
immunity.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir,
and
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
--
to
the
statute
involved,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
statute
is
reprinted
in
a
number
of
places
in
the
--
in
the
record.
the
one,
let's
see,
that
occurs
to
me
most
readily
is
it's
reprinted
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief.
i
know
we
have
also
printed
it
without
trying
to
find
precisely
where
that
pages
two
and
three
of
the
government's
brief,
the
statute
--
the
--
the
text
appears
fully.
now,
it
is
quite
customary
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
pardon
me.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
it
please
the
court,
it
says
whenever
in
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
attorney,
the
testimony
of
any
witnesses
and
so
on.
reading
through
that,
going
to
--
if
--
if
the
court
will
to
the
portion,
“but
no
such
witness
shall
be
prosecuted
or
subjected
to
any
penalty
or
forfeiture
on
account
of
any
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
he
is
compelled
after
having
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
testify
or
produce
evidence.”
now,
it
--
it
--
the
clear
wording
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
testimony
which
is
required
of
this
--
of
a
witness
in
these
proceedings.
in
order
that
there'd
be
immunity,
first,
as
the
statute
says
he
must
have
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
then,
he
must
have
been
directed
to
testify
over
that
claim
of
self-incrimination.
and
third,
necessarily,
he
must
testify.
now,
i
suggest
earnestly
to
this
court
that
the
--
in
order
that
a
witness
be
permitted
in
a
--
into
a
subsequent
stage,
if
he
be
placed
in
jeopardy
of
any
sort,
to
claim
the
immunity
conferred
by
this
statute,
necessarily,
it
must
--
it
evolves
upon
him
that
he
must
be
able
to
show
that
a
question
was
propounded
to
him,
calling
for
a
specific
--
area
of
--
of
possible
incrimination
and
that
he
testify
in
answer
to
that
question
after
first
having
claimed
his
constitutional
privilege
with
reference
to
it.
now,
if
he
be
told
simply,
"go
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
precisely,
your
honor.
may
i
bring
that
in
reference
to
the
case
at
bar?
in
reference
to
the
case
at
bar,
the
defendant
was
called
in
before
the
grand
jury
and
was
asked
some,
well,
roughly
speaking
100
questions
before
the
grand
jury
as
to
all
of
which
he
claimed
his
constitutional
immunity.
he
then
went
back
before
the
court
and
the
court
told
him
to
answer
questions
propounded
to
you
before
the
grand
jury.
he
went
back
before
the
grand
jury
and
well,
a
--
a
great
many
of
the
same
questions
were
put
to
him.
he
was
asked
for
the
first
time
before
that
grand
jury
concerning
certain
activities
of
a
man
named
pullings.
subsequently,
he
was
indicted
by
that
same
grand
jury
for
having
conspired
with
pullings
for
the
sale
of
narcotics.
now,
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
had
he
obeyed
the
court's
order
and
had
he
gone
back
and
simply
testified
as
to
everything
that
was
asked
of
him,
it
could
be
very
tenably
and,
i
think,
unassailably
argued
in
the
--
with
reference
to
this
very
identical
subsequent
indictment
returned
against
him.
it
could
be
very
tenably
argued
and,
i
think,
successfully
that
as
to
the
questions
concerning
pullings,
he
had
never
claimed
his
constitutional
immunity,
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
and
that
therefore,
there
was
no
immunity
grant
as
to
that,
this
was
a
brand
new
question.
now,
i
--
may
i
suggest
to
your
honor
one
further
reason
why
procedural
regularity
--
procedural
due
process,
really,
requires
that
the
witness
be
compelled
to
answer
specific
questions.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
when
this
man
appeared
first
before
the
grand
jury,
as
i
say,
some
roughly
100
questions
were
asked
of
him,
it
may
be
70,
it
may
be
--
i
don't
know,
but
a
--
a
large
number.
he
went
back
before
the
grand
jury
for
the
second
time,
if
it
please
the
court,
some
four
or
five
days
later.
now,
was
it
then
incumbent
upon
him
to
perform
the
--
the
memory
feat
of
being
able
to
recall
specifically
what
questions
were
asked
of
him
and
what
questions
were
not,
particularly
in
circumstances
where
the
prosecutor
himself
appears
to
have
been
confused
for
after
promising
the
defendant
that
he
was
just
going
to
ask
him
these
questions
over
again,
he
goes
off
into
the
new
area
of
--
of
the
mr.
spurlock
and
pullings.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don't
know
if
i
properly
understand
your
--
your
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
would
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
says
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
it
says
that
he
cannot
be
--
some
prosecutors
are
subjected
to
any
penalty
or
forfeiture
for
or
account
of
any
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
he
is
compelled
after
having
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
testify
or
produce
evidence.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
would
think
so,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well
--
oh,
certainly.
it
covered
a
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
indeed,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
indeed,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
is.
if
the
witness
before
the
grand
jury
is
able
to
establish
that
the
proper
--
that
he
has
followed
the
proper
procedures.
for
example,
it's
a
condition
precedent
to
his
--
to
his
acquiring
immunity
under
the
statute,
an
absolute
condition
precedent,
that
he
must
first
have
claimed
his
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
with
reference
to
that
particular
--
using
the
--
the
statutory
language
with
reference
to
that
transaction,
matter
or
thing.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
he
must
first
have
claimed
his
constitutional
immunity
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
pardon
me?
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
he
did
that.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
to
go
back
and
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
requirements
of
the
statute
are,
i
think,
largely
what
we're
--
what
we
are
here
to
settle
today
as
best
i
--
i
can
urge
upon
your
honors
the
necessity
of
its
being
settled.
the
--
the
requirements
of
the
statute
here
would
indeed
extend.
there's
no
question
that
they
would
extent
to
any
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
he
was
then
compelled
to
testify
after
having
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
as
to
those
transactions,
matters
or
things.
no
question
of
that,
sir.
the
question
rather
is
that
--
well,
it's
--
it's
really
twofold.
first,
in
a
subsequent
prosecution
against
him
for
a
substantive
offense,
the
defendant
is
entitled,
i
should
think,
at
the
very
least
to
an
unassailable
grounds
for
the
showing
that
indeed,
he
had
testified
that
--
concerning
these
matters
in
pursuance
of
an
order
of
court,
only
after
having
first
claimed
his
constitutional
immunity.
secondly,
if
it
please
the
court,
he
--
the
--
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
he
has
--
he
would
have
achieved
immunity
under
these
proceedings
specifically,
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
indeed,
he
would
not
have
with
reference
to
the
questions
concerning
pullings
and
spurlock
because
they
were
asked
of
him
for
the
first
time
on
his
second
grand
jury
appearance.
had
he
simply
answered
those
questions,
he
would
have
had
immunity
in
the
other
areas.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir,
indeed,
there
was.
but
you
see,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
only
ones
that
he's
going
to
get
immunity
on
are
in
those
--
as
with
preference
to
those
transactions,
matters
or
things
concerning
which
he
has
previously
claimed
his
constitutional
immunity.
had
he
answered
the
questions
concerning
pullings
or
spurlock
which
were
put
to
him
at
the
time
of
his
second
grand
jury
appearance,
had
he
answered
those
questions,
he
would
have
acquired
no
immunity
whatever.
and
i
cannot
urge
that
upon
this
court
too
strongly.
the
fact
is
that
with
reference
to
those
--
to
--
to
those
questions,
he
had
not
theretofore
gone
through
the
statutory
routine,
the
statutory
procedure
of
claiming
his
--
of
claiming
possible
self-incrimination
being
ordered
over
that
claim
to
answer
the
question
and
then
asking
it
--
of
their
been
answering
it.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
that's
a
question
that
could
be
answered
unless
we
knew
what
the
petitioner's
answers
to
those
questions
would
have
been.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
would
not
think
that
your
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
in
my
view,
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
--
in
my
view,
your
honor,
the
defendant
would
then
have
the
burden
of
sitting
back
and
asking
himself
at
the
time
of
his
second
grand
jury
appearance.
when
each
question
is
propounded
to
him,
he
would
have
to
say,
"does
this
relate
to
a
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
i
have
previously
asserted
my
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
if
it
does,
i
will
answer
it.
if
it
does
not,
i
will
not
answer
it."
that
would
be
his
burden
right
there,
his
burden
at
a
subsequent
time
of
showing
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
i
understand,
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
i
understand
your
honor
properly,
if
you're
asking
me
whether
i
think
that
this
court
would
sustain
such
a
procedure
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
--
i
can
honestly
say
no.
if
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
your
--
if
your
honor
would
ask
me
whether
such
a
procedure
would
be
attempted,
i
would
respectfully
have
to
say
to
your
honor
that
i
have
seen
worst
things
happen.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
no,
your
honor,
nor
i
think
needed
be
formulated
upon
the
basis
that
leaves
it
to
them
to
determine
how,
in
fact,
they
will
behave.
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
proposition
here
however
many
equities
it
may
raise
in
favor
of
a
defendant
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
if
i
--
if
i
might
interrupt
there,
your
honor.
the
court
does
not
make
that
determination.
the
court,
under
the
statute,
is
limited
to
simply
determining
whether
the
attorney
general's
application
is
improper
for
him.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
don't
say
automatically.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
there
was
never
a
suggestion
made
to
this
court,
your
honor,
that
the
appellant
piemonte
was
in
the
position
substantially
or
materially
to
assist
the
grand
jury's
inquiry.
the
--
the
court
was
never
given
any
background
for
the
--
any
reason
why
his
testimony
might
be
important
even
up
to
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
it
--
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
--
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
it
would
be
a
virtual
impossibility
for
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury,
a
year
after
his
appearance
there
to
show
that,
in
fact,
he
had
answered
a
given
question
in
response
into
an
--
to
an
inquiry
put
to
him
by
a
prosecutor
before
that
grand
jury
after
first
having
claimed
his
constitutional
immunity
in
that
field.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
that
would
be
one
way
of
doing
it.
there
is
a
second
way
and
that
is
the
way
that
your
honor
has
suggested
that
the
court
may
say
essentially
with
reference
to
this
specific
questioning
--
this
specific
thing
which
the
prosecutor
told
you,
to
wit,
"i'm
going
to
ask
you
about
your
involvement
in
certain
narcotics
transactions,
answer
that
question
and
all
related
questions."
and
in
that
area,
you
will
acquire
immunity.
but
simply
to
say
to
him,
"go
and
answer
questions
concerning
narcotics,"
i
just
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
this
man
has
--
can
be
said
to
have
theretofore
claim
a
general
area
of
constitutional
immunity
concerning
narcotics
as
a
whole.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
think
that
the
court
--
the
court
entered
two
--
made
two
such
statements,
if
--
if
it
please
your
honor,
one
of
them
in
the
form
of
a
verbal
order,
the
other
one
in
the
form
of
a
written
order.
the
verbal
order
--
in
the
verbal
order,
the
court
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
concerning
the
matter
of
their
investigation
is
what
he
was
told
the
answer
on
there.
leaving
to
him
to
determine
just
what
was
the
matter
of
their
investigation
and
to
prove
it
at
a
subsequent
juncture,
if
he
should
be
exposed
to
jeopardy
at
some
sort.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
not
other
than
that
they
were
investigating
violations
of
certain
narcotic
statutes,
possibly
among
other
things
there
--
there's
no
way
of
knowing.
but
that
they
were
at
least
investigating
violations
of
certain
narcotic
statutes.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
can
see,
mr.
justice
black,
a
very
strong
area
of
analogy.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
certainly.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
certainly,
your
honor,
in
order
--
sufficiently
specific
as
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
--
as
to
minimize
the
difficulties
that
he
might
encounter
at
a
subsequent
juncture.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
no
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
the
court
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
the
court
please,
the
statutes
says
that
the
court
--
the
court
doesn't
grant
immunity.
what
the
court
does
is
to
energize
the
immunity
statute
in
such
manner
that
if
the
witness
subsequently
complies
with
the
directions
given
to
him,
he
will
then
receive
immunity.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
no,
your
honor.
for
everything
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
--
that
he
says
after
having
first
claimed
his
constitutional
privilege
not
to
testify
with
reference
thereto
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
i
may,
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
the
scope
of
the
immunity
is
to
any
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
the
witness
is
compelled
after
having
claimed
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
testify
or
produce
evidence.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
he
has
first
claimed
his
constitutional
privilege.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
as
would
be
the
case
in
the
hypothetical
situation
that
your
honor
mentions
where
the
--
where
the
prosecutors
starts
out
by
saying,
"now,
i'm
going
to
ask
you
questions
concerning,
generally,
your
involvement
in
narcotics
transactions,"
and
the
witness
says
"you
can
save
your
time.
i
refuse
to
incriminate
myself."
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
indeed.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
no,
your
honor.
he
could
say
go
back
and
answer
that
question
and
any
other
questions
related
to
it.
in
the
--
in
the
case
at
bar,
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
there
were
100
questions
or
so
there
for
the
court
to
direct
the
witness
to
answer,
any
one
or
more
than.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
in
general,
your
honor,
they're
related,
so
far
as
they
can
--
or
shown
to
relate
to
anything
specific,
they're
related
to
the
field
of
narcotics.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
bearing,
your
honor,
upon
those
questions.
bearing
upon
those
transactions,
matters
or
things.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well,
if
it
--
if
it
please
the
court,
while
the
statutes
doesn't
specifically
spell
out
that
particularly
vicious
procedure,
it
certainly
leaves
the
door
open
to
it.
if
the
--
if
the
--
if
it
is
shown
that
a
witness
gave
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
concerning
a
transaction,
matter
or
thing
with
reference
to
which,
he
did
not
first
claimed
the
provisions
--
the
benefits
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
thereafter
received
directions
to
testify
that
were
shown
that
he
did
that,
then
there
would
be
no
immunity.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
mr.
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
mr.
justice
black,
i
--
i
cannot
conceive
that
this
court
would
sustain
the
procedure
that
would
evolve
from
this,
nor,
however,
can
i
conceive
that
a
plea
in
bar
against
the
prosecution
could
be
made
with
certainty
below,
unless
it
were
shown
that
this
plea
in
bar
related
to
a
transaction,
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
a
witness
was
first
asked,
claimed,
secondly,
his
-
his
constitutionally
immunity,
third,
was
directed
to
answer
over
that
immunity
and
then
fourth,
answered.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don't
conceive
that
this
court
would
approve
of
it,
if
it
could
sufficiently
be
shown
to
this
court
that,
in
fact,
that's
what
had
happened.
but
i
would
commend
to
your
honor
the
very
serious
consideration
that
when
a
man
is
simply
told,
"go
answer
questions,"
a
year
later
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
for
him
to
prove
what
questions,
in
fact,
he
answered
under
that
direction.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
a
year
later,
your
honor,
if
they're
not
typed
up,
it
sometimes
very
nearly
impossible,
and
i
think
this
court
is
not
in
frequently
confronted
with
situations
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
if
your
honor
please,
a
man
who
succeeds
in
keeping
within
the
law
has
theoretically
no
difficulty
in
any
situation.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i'm
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
well
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
that's
what
i've
been
trying
to
sell
you,
your
honor.
sometimes
he
does.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
have
--
i
want
to
save
sometime
for
rebuttal.
i
would
like
to
make
one
other
basic
point
to
this
court,
if
i
might,
and
that's
this.
the
defendant
here,
having
been
held
in
contempt
and
having
filed
his
notice
of
appeal
from
that
contempt
to
adjudication.
this
defendant
thereupon
was
indicted
some
five
or
six
days
later
by
the
same
grand
jury
concerning
which
he
was
being
punished
for
refusal
to
testify.
i
--
i
submit
to
this
court
that
this
is
nothing
less
than
a
--
a
really
basic
proposition
of
the
--
the
inquisitorial
as
opposed
to
the
accusatory
method
of
--
or
theory
of
criminal
jurisprudence.
i
don't
think
that
this
court,
--
for
example,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
would
ever
approve
a
situation
in
which
a
defendant
might
be
indicted
with
say
four
other
men
at
a
total
four-count
indictment
relating
to
narcotics.
that
he
might
be
then
called
to
the
witness
stand
and
forced
to
testify
on
count
1,
exposing
thereby
his
--
his
basic
criminality
or
--
or
lack
of
reliability
to
the
jurors
for
consideration
on
their
other
three
counts
which
may
not
be
met
the
transactions,
matters
or
things
concerning
which
he
has
compelled
to
testify
under
the
--
under
the
specific
grand
of
immunity
given
him.
i
think
that
this
court
can
very
well
concede
that
a
grant
of
immunity
may
be
so
limited
as
to
--
restricted
to
the
transaction
of
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
jones
and
to
have
no
application
at
all
to
the
sale
of
narcotics
to
smith.
now,
if
either
this
statute
will
authorize
a
man's
being
called
as
--
as
a
witness
against
his
codefendants
on
other
counsel
that
a
trial
where
--
where
he
is
himself
defendant
to
a
count
or
else
it
will
not
admit
the
procedure
that
was
adopted
here.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
by
choosing
to
treat
the
defendant
as
a
defendant
by
indicting
him
for
a
substantive
offence,
he
became
justified
in
his
refusal
to
have
answered
questions
theretofore.
and
i
would
define
that,
if
i
may,
briefly
in
--
in
just
--
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
pardon?
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
i
do,
your
honor.
i
do.
i
say
this.
the
statute
deprives
a
man
of
the
right
to
refuse
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
may
tend
to
incriminate
him.
but
the
fact
that
his
testimony
may
tend
to
incriminate
him
is
a
derivative
doctrine.
the
constitution
does
not
expressly,
in
so
many
words,
give
a
man
a
guarantee
against
the
giving
of
testimony
that
might
--
may
serve
to
incriminate
him
at
a
subsequent
time
in
a
--
in
a
different
form.
rather
what
the
constitution
provides,
in
so
many
words,
is
that
a
citizen
--
that
a
--
an
individual
may
not
be
called
to
--
as
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
case.
that
he
may
not
be
required
to
--
to
give
evidence
against
himself
in
a
criminal
case.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
subsequent
to
this,
there
has
derived
a
--
a
derivative
doctrine
on
this
which
says
that
in
no
form,
at
anytime,
can
you
compel
a
man,
absent
immunity
statutes,
to
give
testimony
which
may
serve
to
incriminate
him
subsequently.
you
cannot
force
jones
to
give
evidence
in
smith's
trial
that
may
incriminate
jones
where
he,
thereafter,
indicted.
that's
the
derivative
doctrine.
the
basic
constitutional
doctrine
is
that
a
man
cannot
be
forced
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are,
i
think,
by
settled
decisions
of
this
court,
part
of
the
criminal
case.
the
question
was
the
criminal
case
against
whom,
at
the
time
that
he
--
that
--
that
the
defendant
was
there
before
the
--
the
grand
jury
at
all
times,
thereafter,
up
to
the
time
--
up
to
the
very
time
of
his
sentencing.
it
was
a
good
--
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
substantiate
the
claim
that
this
was
a
criminal
case
against
him.
but
it
was,
and
the
distinction
is
this.
if
jones
be
called
as
a
witness
in
smith's
trial,
he
is
excused
from
answering
questions
only
on
the
grounds
that
those
answers
may
tend
to
incriminate
him,
jones.
if
he
doesn't
--
if
he
doesn't
say
that,
he
can
be
forced
to
testify.
if
smith
be
called
in
smith's
trial,
smith
cannot
be
forced
to
testify
at
all.
he
need
not
say
his
estimony
may
tend
to
incriminate
him.
he
has
an
absolute
privilege
against
being
called
to
testify
at
all
in
a
criminal
case
against
himself.
now,
the
statute,
the
immunity
statute,
with
which
we
are
here
confronted,
says
nothing
at
all,
nor
could
it,
i
believe,
proper
to
say
anything
at
all
about
taking
away
the
right
of
an
individual
to
refuse
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
case.
rather
it
takes
away
the
derivative
right,
the
right
to
refuse
to
give
answers
in
proceedings
other
than
a
direct
criminal
case
against
the
witness
himself,
which
may
serve
to
incriminate
him
later
in
a
different
matter.
that's
the
right
that's
taken
away
by
this
statute.
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
had
the
indictment
been
returned
against
piemonte,
the
appellant
here,
before
his
sentencing
for
contempt,
have
that
been
done,
no
sentence
for
contempt
would
have
been
possible
because
of
the
fact
that
the
worst
thing
that
could
be
said
against
the
appellant
in
that
circumstance,
is
that
he
was
sought
to
be
punished
for
refusing
to
become
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
case.
surely,
if
you
take
the
view
that
he
was
properly
granted
immunity,
he
no
longer
had
the
right
to
refuse
to
testify
on
the
grounds
that
his
testimony
might
incriminate
him.
but
he
still
had
the
very
viable
robust
right
not
to
give
testimony
against
himself
in
a
criminal
case,
and
this
is
a
right
which
is
not
affected
by
the
immunity
statute.
and
i,
therefore,
submit
to
the
court
that
by
indicting
piemonte,
the
grand
jury
treated
him
as
a
defendant
rather
than
a
witness
in
ultimate
terms
in
the
final
analysis.
that's
what
he
was,
was
a
defendant,
and
a
defendant
cannot
be
compelled
in
a
criminal
case
to
give
evidence
against
himself,
and
the
immunity
statute
does
not
touch
upon
that
aspect
of
the
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
very
well,
sir,
although
this
is
something
that
goes
more
to
the
indictment
itself
and
as
the
government
has
submitted
in
a
supplemental
memorandum,
the
defendant
was
found
not
guilty
under
that
indictment.
but
certainly,
they
cannot
have
been
unaffected.
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
rebuttal?
mr.
melvin
b.lewis
thank
you.
