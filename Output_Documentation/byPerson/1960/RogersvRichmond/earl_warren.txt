but
did
i
understand
counsel
like
in
saying
that
the
coroner
cooperated
with
the
police
in
--
in
holding
him
incommunicado
at
the
very
time
that
he
says
he
advised
him
of
his
right
to
counsel.

determine
the
extent
to
which
a

chief

earl
warren
is
that
to
the
exclusion
of
seeing
his
own
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
to
the
exclusion
of
permitting
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
can
--
how
can
the
authorities
hold
a
man
incommunicado
and
then
at
the
same
time
give
any
--
any
meaning
to
telling
him
that
he
can
have
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
he
was
held
incommunicado
not
only
before
but
after
that
hearing,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
was
there
any
formal
abandonment
to
that
order
of
--
of
incommunicado?
was
he
told
that
he
was
no
longer
incommunicado?
chief

earl
warren
is
there
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
do
we
find
--
where
do
we
find
in
the
record
and
a
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
incommunicado
was
removed?

take
your
time
mr.
ullman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now,
what
does
that
prove
sir?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
question
suggest
it,
not
the
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
i
said
--
is
asked
and
he
says,
"i
don't
remember."
and
then
the
question
was,
"do
you
know
that
on
the
following
day
and
on
many
days
afterwards
the
counsel
were
permitted
and
all
days
afterwards
counsel
were
permitted
to
talk
to
rogers."

"it
could
be."
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,

he
told
that
if
--
if
he
didn't
confess
or
didn't
make
the
statement
that
his
wife
would
be
called?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
the
counsel
said
that
one
of
the
police
officers
said
to
him,
"you're
not
half
a
man
if
you
require
us
to
bring
her
down
here."
chief
justice
earl
warren
less
than
a
man.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
isn't
that
something
of
a
--
of
a
--
a
threat
to
him
that
if
he
doesn't
talk,
doesn't
tell
what
they
want
that
they're
going
to
bring
her
down?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
testimony,
mr.
ullman?
your
associates
may
find
it
if
you
wish
and

may
go
on
and

chief
justice
earl
warren

you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ullman,
if
--
if
the
suggestion
that
they
were
going
to
bring
his
wife
down
was
not
used
as
a
threat,
why
was
it
that
the
captain
would
use
a
rules
such
as
making
it
appear
that
he
was
calling
the
wife
when
he
didn't
actually
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
therefore,
he
was
--
therefore,
he
was
given
to
understand
that
if
--
if
he
didn't
tell
what
they
wanted
to
hear
that
his
wife
would
be
brought
down.
