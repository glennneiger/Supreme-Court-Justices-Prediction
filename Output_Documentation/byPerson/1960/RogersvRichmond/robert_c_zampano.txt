mr.
robert
c.
zampano
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
review
taken
by
judge
smith
throughout
these
proceedings.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
now,
i'll
immediately
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
yes,
sir
and
i'll
immediately
go
to
it.
it's
our
position
that
the
supreme
court
of
errors
stated
unequivocally
that
the
test
of
the
admissibility
of
a
confession
is
whether
it
was
voluntary.
that
appears
at
--
at
page
222
of
the
record,
said,
"later
on
in
discussing
the
claims
made
by
the
petitioner,
the
supreme
court
did
state
that
it
would
depend
on
the
falsity,"
as
your
honor
quite
preferably
quoted,
but
it's
our
position
that
because
of
the
cases
that
cites
therein,
that
it
was
obviously
referring
to
a
cause
of
connection.
in
other
words,
our
supreme
court
was
saying
--
i
think
it's
state
versus
alcoa.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
there's
no
other
way
i
can
answer
the
--
the
second
portion
of
your
question,
except
to
say
that
it's
unfortunate
use
of
the
words
by
judge
wynn.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
but
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
no,
sir.
i
admit
that
the
language
is
unfortunate
that
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
but
well,
i
--
i
do
think
that
what
the
--
judge
wynn
was
driving
at
was
a
cause
of
connection
on
the
rules
and
not
the
test
of
admissibility
of
a
confession
because
prior
to
that,
he
said
the
test
is
and
he
states
it,
the
test
of
admissibility
is
whether
it
is
voluntary
and
i
would
also
like
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
yes,
sir.
the
rule
is
without
question
that
the
falsity
of
the
document
does
not
enter
into
the
consideration
whether
it's
voluntary
or
not.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
that's
right,
this
court,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
well,
certainly
judge
maletz
applied
the
proper
test
and
of
course
that
was
at
the
trial
level
and
it's
judge
maletz's
decision
as
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
that
judge
smith
was
looking
into.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
i
believe
that
the
test
in
connecticut
is
as
this
court
wishes
it
to
be,
but
the
unfortunate
use
of
that
time
by
judge
wynn
is
just
unfortunate,
but
the
test
applied
by
judge
maletz
is
a
test
that
should
be
looked
into
in
which
judge
smith
looked
into.
judge
maletz
is
the
one
that
decided
this
confession
is
voluntary
and
with
respect
to
the
--
there
was
a
question
asked
i
believe
on
the
--
in
the
findings
going
what
was
before
the
supreme
court
i
believe.
in
these
findings,
and
i
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
the
findings
submitted
by
the
state's
attorney
which
is
a
normal
course
of
our
appellate
procedure
in
the
five
months,
there's
no
significance.
there
was
no
counter
finding.
i
think
there
were
some
suggestions
that
they
might
have
been.
there
was
no
counter
finding
submitted
by
the
attorney
before
the
defendant
at
the
time.
and
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
on
the
issue
of
the
--
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
findings
of
fact
that
we
were
talking
about
by
judge
maletz
i
believe
that
there
were
no
counter
findings
or
exceptions
or
anything
else
filed
by
counsel
for
the
defendant,
the
state's
attorney
which
under
his
--
it
was
his
duty
to
file
--
to
file
findings.
our
--
our
appellate
practice
demands
it
in
the
federal
court,
of
course
if
not
so,
however,
at
many
times,
federal
judges
suppose
a
counsel
to
do
that,
but
in
our
state
court,
he
had
to
make
findings
and
the
court
accepted
these
findings.
but
the
finding
of
fact
was
made
at
the
trial
when
judge
maletz
allowed
this
confession
in.
now,
we
have
never
disputed,
never
disputed
judge
smith's
power
to
reanalyze
the
historical
facts
and
come
up
with
another
conclusion.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
well,
we
believe
under
the
law
that
judge
smith
could
very
well,
have
taken
the
facts
as
filed
by
judge
maletz,
the
historical
facts
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
revalue
these
facts
to
come
out
and
see
what
conclusion
he'd
arrive
at
and
that
is
the
duty
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
exactly,
exactly.
in
other
words,
we
have
never
disputed
the
federal
district
court's
power
to
redetermine
the
constitutional
issue.
all
we
claimed
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court
would
claim
that
judge
smith
and
any
other
federal
judge
cannot
disturb
the
historical
facts
unless
there's
some
reason.
in
other
words,
we
use
the
word
"vital
flaw"
in
state
proceedings,
exceptional
circumstances.
judge
smith
himself
went
beyond
that
and
he
said,
"i
must
find
something
in
the
state
record
before
i
can
remake."
there's
a
difference
between
revalue
and
remake
the
historical
facts.
he
said,
"i
must
find
something
in
the
state
record
which
would
warrant
me
overruling
a
state
trial."
so
he
looked
at
the
state
record
and
he
said
these
issues
were
fairly
and
conscientiously
tried
by
an
experienced
judge.
and
based
on
the
historical
facts
as
found
by
this
experienced
judge,
he
said
that
his
opinion,
the
confessions
were
not
inadmissible
in
evidence.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
judge
smith
went
beyond
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
judge
smith
said
this
--
yes,
sir
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
no.
i
--
i
think
it
was
the
same.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
yes,
because
they
quoted
with
approval,
they
quote
judge
smith,
what
judge
smith
say
i
believe
about
this
court's
decision
and
said
that
he
applied
a
very
drawn
and
liberal
scope,
and
judge
smith
himself
i
think
analyzed
it
very
well.
i
--
i
think
there
--
there
was
a
problem
there
in
--
in
determining
what
the
full
significance
of
this
court's
per
curiam
decision
was.
professor
pollak
gave
his
view.
we
gave
ours
and
there's
been
larger
articles
written
about
it
and
so
forth.
but
i
--
i
do
think
that
judge
smith
took
a
very
liberal
view
of
his
powers
and
i
think
it's
a
--
it's
a
very
good
view,
in
--
in
terms
of
symbols.
if
the
facts
a,
b
and
c
go
to
a
federal
judge
and
the
state
trial
comes
out
with
conclusion
that
confession
is
voluntary
based
on
a,
b
and
c,
we
say
that
a
federal
judge
should
take
a,
b
and
c
and
see
if
he
arrives
at
the
same
conclusion,
but
he
has
a
perfect
right
not
to.
if
--
if
judge
smith
took
our
facts,
the
historical
facts
is
found
by
the
state
trial
and
said
this
confession
is
involuntary,
we
--
we
would
have
had
packed
our
bags
and
go
home
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
that's
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
absolutely.
now,
if
judge
smith
also
could
have
said,
"well,
wait
a
minute,
you
give
me
facts
a,
b
and
c,
but
i
think
fact
d
should
be
going
into."
fine,
he
can
hold
a
hearing
and
hear
about
fact
d.
now,
if
judge
smith
looks
at
the
trial
record
and
says
that
this
--
this
state
proceeding
is
tainted
with
prejudice
or
that
the
defendant
was
not
given
a
fair
hearing
then
he
could
throw
out
a,
b
and
c.
he
could
throw
it
out
and
say,
"i
won't
listen
to
it.
i
don't
want
--
i
won't
rule
on
it.
i'm
going
to
hold
a
hearing
de
novo."
now,
all
we're
saying
is
that
before
a
federal
judge
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
of
course.
yes,
that's
correct.
but
--
that's
quite
correct.
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
full
transcript
was
there
or
if
there
was
some
--
for
example,
a
vital
flaw
in
my
opinion
is
that
very
instance
where
the
trial,
there's
no
findings
of
fact,
no
historical
facts.
i
think
a
federal
judge
must,
must
hear
--
have
a
hearing
de
novo
or
should
have.
but
in
our
case,
he
looked
at
the
state
trial
proceedings
and
he
said
the
--
that
there's
no
lack
of
due
process.
so,
he
says,
"i
would
disagree
if
i
had
to
hear
the
same
testimony."
but
he
said
judge
maletz
is
an
experienced
judge
and
so
am
i
inferentially,
and
i
should
not
overrule
him
just
because
we
have
a
difference
of
opinion.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
as
to
your
latter
question,
the
supreme
court
may
do
that.
as
to
your
former,
i'm
not
sure
where
the
--
the
negative
come
in
there,
but
the
supreme
court
has
power
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
--
to
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
that's
right.
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
if
he
has
--
using
my
symbols,
he
has
facts
a,
b
and
c
and
he
says
to
us,
"well,
how
about
fact
d?"
then
at
that
--
and
we
say,
"we
have
no
finding
on
that,
your
honor."
then
at
that
point,
i
believe
he
should
hold
the
area.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
yes,
i
--
i
--
if
the
transcript
is
there.
i
think
he
should.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
that's
right.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
all
we
object
to
is
that
he
has
a
hearing
de
novo
for
no
reason.
if
he
has
a
reason
then
--
then
have
a
hearing
de
novo.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
he
has
no
right
do
that,
unless
--
unless,
looking
at
the
state
transcript,
he
finds
that
there's
exceptional
circumstances.
for
example,
it's
not
beyond
beliefs
that
state
trier
could
be
prejudice
against
the
defendant.
the
judge
himself
--
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
right.
mr.
robert
c.
zampano
right.
and
another
clear
example
is
this,
i
think
in
these
instances
where
the
--
the
defendant
takes
the
stand
and
at
this
preliminary
hearings
and
the
judge
allows
a
prosecutor
go
into
the
merits
of
the
case,
well,
certainly,
the
counsel
will
keep
him
off
the
stand
if
he
thought
he
could
be
cross-examined
that
way.
in
that
case,
i
think
there's
a
vital
lawsuit.
thank
you
very
much.
