mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
to
the
facts
went
before
the
state
trial
court,
and
the
record
that
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
errors
as
well
as
to
some
of
the
facts
before
the
district
court
in
the
first
hearing.
i'd
like
to
say
at
the
outset
that
judge
smith,
in
the
first
decision,
determined
that
the
proceedings
in
the
connecticut
trial
court
and
in
the
supreme
court
were
tainted
with
a
lack
of
due
--
with
a
lack
of
due
process.
he
made
that
finding
without
ever
having
looked
at
the
proceedings.
he
did
not
have
before
him
the
transcript
testimony
nor
did
he
have
the
findings
made
by
the
trial
court
on
these
confessions.
he
didn't
have
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
and
he
didn't
have
the
confessions
themselves,
which
are
most
illuminating,
in
my
opinion,
as
to
the
condition
of
the
accused
when
he
gave
it.
and
when
i
learned
that
he
hadn't
looked
at
this
record
and
that
was
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
i
moot
to
present
all
of
that
before
you.
he
did
not
accept
them
as
counsel
plan.
he
did
not
accept
everything.
he
rejected
it
(inaudible)
and
they
remarked
merely
as
exhibits
for
identification.
now,
what
were
some
of
these
facts
before
the
trial
court?
we
start
off
by
having
as
a
fact
that
rogers
was
46
years
old,
highly
intelligent,
a
brother
of
a
police
officer
who
had
have
vast
experience
with
the
police
by
reason
of
that
fact
as
well
as
by
reason
of
his
four
previous
arrests.
he
had
been
questioned
by
police
on
a
number
of
cases
as
recently
as
three
weeks
prior
to
this
confession.
he
had
been
arrested
on
the
--
january
on
charges
of
a
contested
robbery,
breaking
and
entering
and
theft.
and
on
that
date,
the
murder
gun
was
found
in
his
possession.
he
was
questioned
and
in
his
first
statement
to
the
police,
he
stated
that
he
wanted
that
afternoon
in
a
cracking.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
but
the
following
day,
he
admitted.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
we
did
not
know
at
that
time
that
it
was
the
murder
gun.
you
see
--
please
your
honor,
this
murder
had
taken
place
from
west
haven
on
november
23rd.
the
arrest
on
january
9th
was
in
new
haven.
there
was
no
test
to
the
gun
made
immediately,
although
orders
have
been
given
around
the
several
towns
to
have
guns
--
all
guns
checked
and
it
wasn't
until
after
rogers
was
found
over
the
superior
court
that
my
office
entered
into
the
case
and
that
had
test
made
and
the
report
of
those
test
came
on
saturday,
january
30th
to
my
office.
so
that
i
say
that
rogers
told
two
different
stories
on
--
on
his
interrogations
there
by
the
police.
finally,
in
the
second,
he
admitted
that
he
had
stolen
the
gun
from
a
home
of
his
nephew
on
or
about
the
date
of
the
murder.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
the
30th
of
january
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
was
the
date
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
yes.
he's
been
held
on
these
other
unrelated
charges
of
attempted
robbery,
breaking
and
entering
and
theft.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
and
in
the
meantime
had
been
bound
over
the
superior
court
on
those
charges
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
waiting
for
trial
on
those
charges
in
the
superior
court.
now,
to
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
he
was
not
been
indicted
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
preliminary
hearing
in
the
city
court
bound
over
probable
cause
having
been
found
by
the
city
court
in
these
several
charges.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
no
--
no
indictment
would
be
required
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
was
connecticut
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
and
we
precede
(inaudible).
so
the
--
to
show
that
he
was
in
no
(inaudible)
of
police,
i
might
mention
the
fact,
which
is
an
evidence
and
which
was
before
the
court,
that
on
the
date
following
the
murder,
when
his
nephew
charged
him
with
the
theft
of
this
gun,
he
denied.
and
he
himself,
rogers,
suggested,
"let's
get
down
to
the
police
and
report
the
gun
was
stolen."
and
rogers
went
there
to
the
police
and
made
such
a
report.
we
maintain
that
rogers
was
well
aware
of
his
rights,
his
right
to
remain
silent,
his
right
to
counsel,
and
his
right
that
--
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything
that
might
incriminate
him.
even
without
a
warning
and
even
without
counsel,
he
was
fully
aware
of
those
rights.
now,
as
to
request
for
counsel,
roger
stated
from
the
preliminary
hearing
that
he
requested
lieutenant
mulhern
asked
lieutenant
mulhern
in
the
afternoon
for
counsel,
for
his
attorney,
and
he
said
that
he
asked
captain
eagan
in
the
evening
for
counsel.
captain
eagan
went
on
the
stand
and
said
that
no
request
for
counsel
was
made
by
rogers
that
evening
and
the
detective
is
present
in
the
afternoon,
had
not
reported
any
such
request
having
been
made
that.
lieutenant
mulhern
was
not
presented
because
he
was
hospitalized
on
this
particular
date.but
at
any
rate,
you
have
there
a
conflict
of
testimony.
rogers
claiming
that
he
has
made
the
request
both
times,
eagan
claiming
that
he
did
not
make
the
request
of
him
and
that
no
report
of
any
such
request
had
been
made
by
the
officers.
the
court
--
the
trial
court
was
called
upon
to
resolve
that
conflict
and
it
chose
to
predict
eagan,
as
that
kind
of
right
to
do.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
now
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
is
correct.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
yes,
that
is
our
claim.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
merely
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
merely
because
the
statement
by
a
witness
is
not
denied
categorically,
the
court
can
still
choose
to
disbelief
the
--
the
witness.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
on
the
basis
of
sizing
him
up,
having
seen
him
or
having
heard
him
and
having
known
this
background
that
rogers
had.
now,
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
the
hearing
before
judge
smith,
we
presented
lieutenant
mulhern
and
two
other
officers
who
stated
definitely
that
no
request
was
made
by
rogers
for
counsel
at
any
time
in
the
afternoon
and
that
cover
the
whole
day.
but
the
findings
made
by
judge
maletz,
the
accuse
did
not
at
anytime
on
the
day
of
the
question
request
the
presence
or
assistance
of
an
attorney
and
we
submit
that
on
the
evidence
and
on
sizing
up
the
witnesses
that
judge
maletz
was
amply
justified
in
making
that
broad
finding.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
rogers?
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
rogers
testified
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
before
judge
smith?
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
yes,
he
did
sir.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
correct.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
and
he
dismissed
the
testimony
of
the
three
officers
whom
he
heard
and
captain
eagan
whom
he
didn't
give,
by
saying
that
their
recollection
is
that
--
coincide
with
their
subconscious
urges
for
getting
as
we
think
that
the
subconscious
urge
of
the
accused
would
be
far
stronger
than
the
--
that
of
four
officers.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
he
--
judge
smith
quoted
that
it
was
probable
if
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
but
we
submit
that
rogers
was
amply
competent
to
choose
to
dispense
with
counsel.
we
say
that
he
did
at
that
day
and
he
obviously
did
it
the
next
day
when
he
was
reminded
by
the
coroner
in
a
full
and
complete
fashion
of
his
right
to
counsel,
his
right
to
--
to
choose
not
to
testify
and
is
the
fact
that
anything
that
he
did
say
would
be
used
against
him.
rogers
was
altogether
confident
to
choose
to
dispense
with
counsel
as
he
did
on
both
the
cases.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
if
your
honor
please,
yes,
sir.
on
the
day
(inaudible)
had
first
confession
to
the
police.
the
coroner
issued
orders
to
hold
rogers
incommunicado.
he
was
intending
to
question.
he
wasn't
able
to
get
to
it
because
of
five
or
six
deaths
that
occurred
on
that
morning
and
--
from
a
gas
explosion,
so
he
didn't
get
it
until
the
afternoon.
now,
petitioner
didn't
ask
the
counsel,
but
counsel
that
has
been
engaged
in
this
other
case
attempted
to
see
him
and
was
confronted
with
the
fact
that
the
coroner
had
issued
an
order
to
be
held
incommunicado.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
it
was
the
lawyer
that
he
--
that
was
representing
him
in
this
other
case.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
well,
probably
not.
the
--
he
does
have
a
duty
to
advise
him
that
he's
entitled
to
counsel
and
give
him
an
opportunity
to
get
it
if
he
indicates
that
he
wants
it.
there
is
some
provision
in
the
law
that
witnesses
can
be
held
separate
while
being
--
while
the
case
is
under
investigation.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
the
supreme
court
seemed
to
indicate
that
that
would
not
permit
it.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
(inaudible)
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
the
supreme
court
indicated
that
that
was
not
to
the
exclusion.
that
it
should
not
have
been
done.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
well,
by
--
the
order
of
holding
him
incommunicado,
he
was
--
it
was
indicated
that
he
was
being
held
as
a
witness
or
as
a
suspect.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
2
o'clock
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
until
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
he
was
being
questioned
as
a
suspect.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
he
was
being
questioned
as
a
suspect
because
this
information
as
the
ballistics
had
just
been
received.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
i
conceive
that
the
order
holding
him
incommunicado
should
not
have
been
issued,
but
i
say
that
that
refusal
access
by
counsel,
not
by
any
request
of
--
of
the
prison
that
he
wanted
counsel,
but
the
refusal
was
of
really
no
significance.
his
first
confession
was
already
a
matter
of
record
and
in
view
of
his
rejection
of
counsel,
just
a
few
hours
later
by
the
coroner,
i
say
that
the
refusal
of
access
of
the
jail
that
day
is
of
no
relevance
here.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
if
he
elected
to
have
counsel,
have
being
informed
of
his
right
to
counsel,
the
counsel
would
have
been
procured
where
the
--
there
would
have
been
an
adjournment
and
opportunity
for
counsel
to
appear
what
have
been
ordered.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
no.
at
the
earliest
--
up
to
the
--
the
conclusion
of
the
coroner's
hearing,
there
was
no
refusal
to
counsel
then.
the
counsel
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
had
access
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
can't
be
sure
of
that,
but
it
was
removed
at
the
conclusion
of
the
coroner's
testimony
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
but
i
say
that
there
were
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
think
in
the
testimony
of
the
jailer
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
(inaudible)
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
is
right.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
the
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
on
page
--
now
brief
on
page
8,
we
indicate
the
matters,
documents,
records,
specified
by
judge
smith
on
remand,
after
remand.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
well
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
at
the
first
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
the
--
at
the
--
at
the
first
hearing,
i
believe
that
all
of
the
testimony
on
the
preliminary
hearing
were
submitted.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that's
right.
of
the
trial
--
of
the
trial
minute
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
however
the
findings
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
think
that
the
--
the
large
part
of
the
testimony
on
the
preliminary
hearing
was
submitted.
there
were
few
pages
that
were
not
--
however,
none
on
the
transcript
of
the
evidence
aside
from
that
was
submitted
to
judge
smith.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
well,
in
answer
to
--
question
to
chief
justice
at
page
50
in
the
record
directly
after
the
cross-examination
by
mr.
ullman,
directly
after
the
31st
of
january,
after
the
coroner's
hearing
was
held
late
afternoon,
this
order
of
incommunicado
with
relief
withdrawn.
the
answer,
"i
don't
remember."
"do
you
know
that
on
the
following
day
and
on
many
days
after
which,
the
counsel
were
committed
and
all
days
after
which
counsel
were
committed
to
talk
to
rogers?"
answer,
it
could
be.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
well,
that
directly
or
almost
directly
after,
the
conclusion
of
the
coroner's
hearing
on
the
31st
that
this
order
as
to
being
incommunicado
was
released.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
may
be
--
that
may
--
that
is
quite
so.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
think
there
may
be
something
else.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
but
that
isn't
altogether
satisfactory,
but
there
has
been
no
question
about
that
counsel
for
the
defendant
had
accessed
to
him
directly
after
the
conclusion
of
the
coroner's
hearing.
and
of
course,
long
before
the
indictment
by
the
grand
jury
and
of
course
at
all
time
since
the
indictment
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
it
was
withdrawn.
i
can't
find
any
record
as
to
when
it
was
withdrawn
but
i
know
that
there
has
been
no
claim
following
the
interrogation
by
the
coroner
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
from
the
commencement
of
that
--
of
that
interrogation
where
the
coroner
said
that
he
was
entitled
to
counsel,
that
the
counsel
would
have
had
access
to
him.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
on
that
date.
that
was
before
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
yes.
that
was
in
morning.
that
order
was
issued.
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that's
right.
then
in
the
afternoon,
there
was
a
hearing
before
the
coroner
when
the
second
confession
came,
was
elicited
and
at
the
outset
of
that,
the
coroner
informed
rogers
of
his
right
to
counsel
and
he
refused
to
avail
himself
of
that
right.
so
that
i
say
that
it's
a
practical
proposition
of
the
time
that
the
coroner
announced
his
right
to
counsel,
counsel
could
have
seen
him.
as
to
lack
of
warning,
much
has
been
made
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
is
correct.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
in
fact
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
questioning
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
in
that,
well
i
can't
find
the
testimony.
finding
number
128,
page
320
indicates
that
his
incommunicado
status
was
released
the
following
day.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that's
right.
now,
some
reference
has
been
made,
the
fact
that
there
was
no
warning
given
to
the
accused.
the
testimony
of
captain
eagan
on
page
20
--
101
and
again
on
page
385
indicates
that
he
said
that
anything
--
he
told
rogers,
"anything
you
do
say,
if
you
say
anything
cannot
be
of
any
benefit
to
you.
i
can
promise
you
no
benefit
before
the
jury."
now
that
warning
was
not
in
the
precise
language
that
counsel
attempted
to
get.
but
yet
but
--
and
--
and
counsel
for
the
petitioner
"limited
portion
of
eagan's
testimony
where
he
says
he
didn't
say
in
precise
words.
i
didn't
tell
him
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything."
but
i
say
that
these
words
or
words
that
were
understood
by
rogers
and
acted
upon
by
it.
but
in
addition
to
that,
before
judge
smith,
rogers
testified
that
he
was
told
by
captain
eagan
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything.
on
page
28
of
the
transcript,
we'll
find
where
rogers
testimony
on
direct
examination
by
his
own
attorney,
tell
me
about
the
telephone
calls.
he
went
to
the
telephone?
no.
that's
before
that.
what
did
he
say
to
you?
you
sat
down
and
started
talking
about
the
time
i
was
in
the
country
jail
on
parole
from
(inaudible)
that
he
remembered
me
from
them
and
then
he
said,
"you
know
the
words
i
didn't
have
to
say
nothing
to
me
--
to
it."
he
didn't
force
nothing
out
of
me
until
he
started
making
a
telephone
call
so
that
we
can't
ask
for
any
more
qualified
witness
than
rogers
himself
that
he
was
in
fact
told
that
he
didn't
have
to
say
anything.
now,
as
to
the
threat
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
the
statement
was
made
by
captain
eagan
to
rogers
during
the
course
of
the
questioning
that
he
would
have
to
send
for
mrs.
rogers,
to
find
out
whether
she
knew
anything
of
this
affair.
captain
egan
said
that
during
your
time
of
the
jail
or
before,
you
might
have
talked
to
your
wife
and
i'm
under
a
duty
to
question.
and
i'm
going
to
send
for
her
to
question
and
during
the
time
that
i
sent
for
her,
i'll
see
that
the
state
warrant
which
were
being
boarded
with
mrs.
rogers
are
taken
care
off
by
a
matron.
now,
rogers
didn't
raise
any
objection
then
that
my
wife
is
sick.
my
wife
is
crippled.
all
he
said,
"she
don't
know
anything
about
what
i
do."
that
same
page,
the
very
next
question,
he
said,
"she
don't
know
anything.
why
do
you
want
to
question
her?"
he
didn't
protest
that
she
was
sick.
we
claimed
that
he
was
fearful
merely
of
what
she
might
say
that
would
be
of
an
incriminating
nature
--
nature.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
he
was
told
not
on
those
precise
words.
he
was
told
that
he
would
have
to
send
--
he
wasn't
getting
any
information
from
rogers.
he
had
to
question
mrs.
rogers
to
see
whether
she
could
throw
any
light
on
this
transaction.
and
he
went
to
pick
up
the
telephone
and
when
rogers
interposed
an
objection
that
she
don't
know
anything,
he
was
then
permitted
to
consider
the
matter
for
an
hour
and
during
that
time,
he
considered
whether
he
should
say
anything
and
what
he
should
say.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
you'd
be
less
than
a
man.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
to
--
that's
right.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
submit,
if
your
honor
please,
that
that
is
not
a
legal
threat.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
police
have
a
right
and
a
duty
to
interrogate
mrs.
rogers.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
and
i
say
that
that's
not
a
threat,
even
if
it
was
preceded
by
the
fact
that
you'll
be
less
than
a
man.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
didn't
say
that,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
said
the
interrogation
started
at
2
o'clock.
she
was
brought
down
to
the
state's
attorney's
office
at
1
o'clock.
no
questions
were
asked
to
him
for
an
hour
because
the
police
were
busy
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
they
were
sending
the
police.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
2
p.m.
and
--
2
p.m.
in
the
afternoon.
and
during
the
course
of
that
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
afternoon
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
well,
the
interrogation
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
testimony
before
judge
maletz
indicates
that
the
elapsed
time
from
the
start
of
the
questioning
until
he
started
to
confess
was
from
2
o'clock
until
about
10:15
at
which
time
he
indicated
that
he
was
going
to
confess
that
i
was
drinking
that
night
and
a
stenographer
was
sent
forth.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
but
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
but
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
there
were
intermissions
and
interruptions
during
the
course
of
that
day.
the
police
were
going
out
and
checking
statements
and
investigating
things
of
all
sorts.
and
long
periods
of
time,
rogers
was
left
alone.
he
was
given
something
to
eat
and
he
did
eat.
and
again,
later
on,
he
was
offered
something
to
eat
and
he
turned
it
down
and
said,
"i
will
have
coffee."
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
even
judge
smith
recognized
that
it
was
intermittent
and
there
wasn't
any
of
the
relentless
questioning
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
how
many
interrogators?
i
think
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
but
perhaps
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
--
during
the
course
of
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
during
the
evening,
only
captain
eagan.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
in
the
afternoon
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
a
little
after
8
o'clock?
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
there
might
have
been
three,
but
not
all
at
one
time
and
there
wasn't
any
of
the
persistent
question
on
the
judge
time
zone.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
is
correct.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
no,
except
that
he
did
admit
--
that
he
knew
where
the
place
was
and
knew
the
woman.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
and
of
course
he
--
and
of
course
he
had
already
admitted
on
january
10th
that
he
had
stolen
this
gun
from
his
nephew's
home,
the
murder
gun.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
they
were
not
satisfied.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that's
right.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
that
is
right.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
will
accept
that
there
was
one
hour
there
in
which
no
--
which
no
questions
were
asked
at
all.
he
questioned
him
probably
from
8
to
9
then
said
he's
going
to
send
for
his
wife,
but
rogers
indicated
that
he
objected
to
it,
stated
objection
was
that
she
didn't
know
anything.
he
then
said,
"well,
i'll
give
you
an
hour
to
consider
whether
you
want
to
talk
to
me
or
whether
we
should
go
ahead
and
question
your
wife."
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
and
so
he
wasn't
questioned
at
all
during
that
hour.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
they
weren't
adopted
children.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
they
were
--
they
weren't
adopted
children.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
they
were
fosters,
children
who
are
boarded
with
him
as
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
for
a
few
months
before
this.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
they
--
they
were
producing
an
income
bound.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
captain
eagan
made
them.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
captain
eagan
said
that
he
would
not
see
that
the
children
were
taken
care
of
by
the
matron.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
on
page
265,
it
appears
with
several
instances.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
bottom
of
that
page,
on
page
199,
perhaps
even
more
in
detail.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
199.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
during
the
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
yes,
sir.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
the
--
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
found
by
the
court
and
on
such
portions
of
the
transcript
that
they
consulted.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
my
associated
finding
discussed
that,
i
might
just
say.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
alright.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
very
well,
thank
you.
and
so
that
--
we
say
that
there
--
that
this
possibly
could
be
construed
to
be
a
threat
if
his
wife
in
fact
was
crippled
but
there
isn't
any
evidence
that
she
is
cripple.
the
only
claim
made
of
that
was
a
belated
claim
at
the
trial,
not
on
the
night
when
--
when
eagan
suggested
a
question
to
him,
that
she
was
sick,
not
that
she
was
cripple,
but
that
she
was
sick.
now,
that
judge
maletz
could
see
her
in
court
everyday
and
he
could
see
that
there
wasn't
any
basis
for
any
such
claim
as
that.
so
the
evidence
is
all
to
the
contrary
and
that
was
all
before
judge
maletz.
now,
we
submit
that
this
threat
was
not
the
motivation
for
the
confession.
here,
this
man
was
confronted
with
formidable
proof
of
his
guilt
of
this
crime
already
in
the
hands
of
the
police.
but
he
had
the
murder
gun
the
day
of
the
murder,
that
he
made
a
false
report
that
it
was
stolen
on
the
day
following
the
murder.
he
had
the
murder
gun
on
the
night
of
his
arrest
and
he
made
these
contradictory
statements
as
to
how
he
happened
to
get
it.
we
say
that
this
confession
came
about
by
reason
of
his
own
self
interest.
he
wanted
to
mitigate
the
plate
that
he
found
himself
in
and
so
he
decided
to
make
a
confession
but
to
blame
his
act
on
liquor
and
upon
the
victim
who
could
no
longer
defend
herself.
and
his
defense
with
the
trial
was
only
in
mitigation.
and
the
hour
that
he
took
to
consider
what
he
should
do,
whether
he
should
confess,
he
exercised
his
mental
freedom
during
that
hour
to
confess
or
deny.
he
made
the
calculated
choice
to
confess
and
to
invent
an
excuse
in
mitigation
or
explanation
of
this
crime.
a
study
of
the
confessions
himself
will
show
that
there
was
no
object
capitulation
here,
that
this
was
a
carefully
considered
narrative,
30
pages
in
length.
it
shows
his
self-possession
and
coolness
throughout
and
it's
a
dramatic
reputation
of
any
claim
that
he
didn't
have
a
choice
to
confess
or
deny.
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
i
suppose
because
he
saw
that
there
was
some
reluctance
on
rogers
part
to
have
his
wife
brought
down,
presumably
his
wife
might
be
able
to
make
incriminating
statements.
he
wanted
to
be
the
one
to
choose,
to
decide
what
line
of
excuse
or
explanation
he
wanted
to
adopt
and
he
didn't
want
his
wife
to
go
ahead
and
to
spoil
things
for
him
to
that
extent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
abraham
s.
ullman
well,
if
he
didn't
tell,
it
would
be
necessary
to
pursue
this
investigation
further,
which
would
necessarily
involve
the
wife.
i
think
perhaps
i
used
my
time,
mr.
zampano.
