justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
pollak?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
conceive
that
the
issue
that
we
have
up
here
simply
goes
to
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
at
this
stage?
justice
john
m.
harlan
reach
the
merits?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
didn't
intend
to
stir
up
a
collateral
issue,
but
i
prompted
my
question
to
this.
judge
smith,
as
i
understand
it,
contrary
to
what
he
did
at
the
first
hearing,
said
that
he
would
discharge
the
writ
in
this
case
before
us,
because
he
found
himself
constricted
in
making
findings
that
he
--
if
free,
he
would
have
otherwise
made.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
haven't
we
decided
against
that
contention?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
think
that
judge
smith,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
same
view
of
the
comment
of
this
court
and
deny
certiorari?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
taking
what
this
court
said
on
denial.
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
different
view
as
to
what
its
interpretation
was
and
what
our
court
in
that
taken
by
judge
smith?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
think
were
the
same?
