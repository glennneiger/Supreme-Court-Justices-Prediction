o.

mr.
zeldes,
do
you
realize
that
i
don't
know
all
these
case
has
been
argued,
but
there
(inaudible)
yet
what
cases
about.
the
facts
that
have
not
been
stated,
the
facts
before
the
state
court,
the
facts
before
the
federal
court,
the
difference
between
the
two.
this
is
all
highly
theoretical
argumentations
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
--
does
it
the
facts
are
important
to
--
or
are
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
i
see
that
here
a
paper,
that's
--
that
--
that
summarizes
a
compilation
of
record
experiences,
record
references,
but
i
haven't
--
hasn't
been
impressed
off
from
me
what
the
--
what
is
relevant
seem
--
the
relevancy
of
these
various
facts
in
the
minds
of
you
or
mr.
pollak
to
the
issues
before
us.
what
are
the
crucial
turning
certain
facts
and
circumstances
and
so
on?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
that,
but
i
mean
in
terms
of
the
facts
of
the
case--what
were
--
what
is
the
turning
point
and
so
on?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
on
the
30th
of
january,
was
it?
the
30th
of
january?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
was
--
he's
been
held
in
21
days?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
judge
smith
did
see
the
rogers,
didn't
he?
he
testified
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
rogers.
justice
william
o.
douglas
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
he
--
as
i
read
his
opinion
on
page
434,
he
emphasizes
--
page
433,
that
the
observation
on
rogers
on
the
stand
and
the
judgment
as
to
his
credibility
as
a
witness
must
be
resolved
before
this
fact
can
be
resolved,
so
he
differed
with
the
state
court
on
that,
didn't
he?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
he
also
thought
that
--
didn't
he,
that
smith
--
judge
smith
that
since
this
man
was
represented
in
another
proceeding
by
a
lawyer,
most
assuredly,
he
would
ask
for
a
lawyer
in
this
capitol
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
