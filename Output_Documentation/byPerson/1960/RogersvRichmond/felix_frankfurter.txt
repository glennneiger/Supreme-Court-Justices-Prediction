justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pollak,
i
don't
want
to
break
in
when
you
get
in
the
mainstream
of
your
argument.
but
it
would
help
me
a
great
deal
when
you
come
to
the
crux
of
your
argument,
you
would
state
exactly
what
was
before
the
state
court
when
the
appeal
came
through
it
with
reference
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
of
(inaudible)
confessions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
there
was
before
this
--
what
there
was
before
the
state
trial
court
as
both
he
hearing
before
the
judges
and
the
absence
of
--
without
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
then
what
went
before
the
jury.
then
what
went
up
to
the
connecticut
supreme
court,
what
they
actually
rule,
and
what
is
after
all
the
ultimate
constitutional
question
here
namely,
whether
this
if
is
a
confession,
is
that
the
core
of
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
a
lot
of
the
things
are
merely
evidentiary
considerations
with
reference
to
that.
with
so
much
discussion
about
whether
he
did
or
didn't
ask
for
consul,
but
not
only
there,
that
isn't
a
constitutional
issue
apart
from
bearing
upon
the
so-called
confessions,
am
i
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
actual
undisputed,
i
hope,
is
(inaudible)
so
that
you
should
agree
what
it
was
really
that
was
before
the
connecticut
supreme
court
on
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
which
you
sought
to
have
had
a
certiorari
here
and
then
what
there
was
before
the
district
judge
the
first
time,
and
what
there
wasn't,
so
that
we
know
what
the
conceded
facts
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
legal
significance
of
any
of
it
but
just
what
the
--
well
i
should
like
to
call
historic
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
your
good
time,
but
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
may
say
so
at
the
outset,
there
is
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
all
of
five
opinion
in
this
case
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
expect
across
your
argument,
i
wanted
you
to
know
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
my
understanding
of
this
case,
once
i
realize
because
i
think
i
do
realize
that
all
the
five
opinions
to
me
are
highly
unsatisfactory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
take
comfort
in
justice
clark's
opinion,
because
i
don't
take
comfort
in
an
opinion
which
says
that
the
district
judge
has
two
appellate
masters.
as
i
understand
that
he
has
only
one
appellate
master,
not
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
lower
court
did
--
the
lower
court
did.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
got
a
judgment
here
saying
that
no
constitutional
right
was
taken,
haven't
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
it's
not
open?
why
is
there
any
question
where
they
should
be
opened?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
why
we
get
into
the
difficulties?
maybe
i
should
get
into
them
myself.
but
you'll
get
into
the
federal
court
on
a
claim
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
--
federal
constitutional
right.
is
it
not
the
way
--
that
--
is
it
not
the
only
basis
of
getting
into
the
federal
court?
is
it
not
the
only
issue
that
was
decided
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
over
the
time
that
this
matter
was
before
the
federal
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
whether
the
--
the
decision
was
rendered
on
an
adequate
basis
is
a
different
question,
but
that
is
the
issue.
the
issue
isn't
what
--
what
the
scope
of
judicial
review
is.
that
may
be
relevant
to
determining
whether
you
affirm
or
reverse
or
remand
what
the
district
court
has
now
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals
has
done.
but
the
issue
is
whether
there
is
a
denial
of
due
process.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
now
doing
--
what
you're
about
to
tell
us
now
is
what
appeared
before
the
state
--
at
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i
hope
you
will.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
that
before
judge
--
before
judge
maletz,
there
was
no
contradiction
of
that
which
you
refer
on
page
241.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
where
is
captain,
if
he
was
a
captain,
eagan's
testimony
on
--
as
to
request
for
a
lawyer
by
rogers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
am
i
right
that
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
state
explicitly
that
he
didn't
ask
that
his
--
his
then
counsel
be
called
to
the
jail,
but
it
--
but
there's
no
--
but
--
but
it
did
not
reject
his
testimony
to
a
jury
referred
on
page
241
that
he
asked
for
his
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
explicit
on
the
point
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
he
--
there's
no
evidence
that
he
didn't
ask
his
counsel
be
sent
to
the
jail,
the
--
it's
explicit
on
that
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
merely
states
his
claim
that
he
didn't
ask
--
that
he
asked
for
counsel.
he
doesn't
reject
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
judge
o'sullivan
in
his
dissent
accepts
his
evidence
since
there
was
no
contradiction
of
it.
he
explicitly
accepts
it,
but
the
supreme
court,
judge
wynn
in
his
opinion
states
the
claim
without
rejecting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
does
state
explicitly
that
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
asked
--
that
he
have
his
counsel
come
to
jail.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
under
connecticut
procedure,
the
supreme
court
had
restricted
to
the
findings
made
by
the
trial
judge
or
may
they
go
to
the
transcript
of
the
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
my
question
was
to
be
--
to
be
made
more
specific.
if
there
is
no
finding,
not
that
the
finding
is
ambiguous
or
capable
of
--
of
one
or
another
interpretation,
but
if
there
is
no
finding
and
there
is
evidence
uncontradicted,
may
this
--
is
the
supreme
court
precluded
from
going
to
the
evidence
because
there
was
no
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
should
be
great
if
it
surprises
of
any
--
the
supreme
court
made
their
findings.
they
can't
go
to
the
evidence
because
there
is
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
ullman
will
touch
the
light
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
submitted
by
who?
justice
felix
frankfurter
petitioner
was
the
moving
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
did
he
submit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
petitioner
had
a
copy
of
the
stenographic
minutes
while
they're
in
the
position
of
counsel
for
rogers,
a
set
of
stenographic
minute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
both
of
the
proceedings
he
brought,
judge
maletz
on
the
admissibility
and
the
--
then
the
whole
trial
charges
request
a
test
--
a
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
made
available
to
you?
was
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
nothing
to
prevent
petitioner
to
submit
the
complete
stenographic
minutes
of
all
proceedings
before
judge
maletz
in
person
or
at
the
presiding
judge
with
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
go
--
did
they
go
up
to
the
supreme
court,
those
finding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
appropriate
to
ask
you
why
those
findings
were
not
submitted
to
judge
smith?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
have
to
follow
you
because
you
couldn't
answer
what
the
kind
of
certainty
of
these
(inaudible)
likes
to
answer
questions.
whether
--
whether
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
is
foreclosed
or
rather
restricted
to
findings
that
go
up
to
it
and
now
you
say
that
these
--
those
findings
are
rather
irrelevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
how
can
they
be
irrelevant
if
those
findings
are
part
of
the
basic
of
what
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
determines?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
your
--
your
--
as
a
matter
of
grace
or
generosity.
i'm
talking
about
the
process
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
the
supreme
--
which
the
--
a
federal
district
court
is
called
upon
may.
the
federal
district
court
as
i
understand
it,
stating
it
summarily,
is
trying
the
trial
as
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court,
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
that's
what
its
doing,
isn't
it?
and
if
it's
trying
the
trial
then
that,
which
is
part
of
the
trial
process,
the
procedural
process
of
the
state
on
which
the
supreme
court,
the
highest
court
of
a
state
act,
i
don't
see
why
that
isn't
most
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
i
assume
that
that's
the
decisive
question
in
the
case
and
for
me,
the
decisive
question
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
this
confession
was
admissible
under
the
standards
laid
down
by
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
findings
of
the
trial
done
on
that
point
are
among
the
most
relevant
things
to
come
before
the
state
court
and
therefore
to
be
considered
by
a
federal
district
court
which
is,
i
repeat,
trying
the
trial
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
more
important
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
me
to
agree
with
you
than
for
me
to
agree
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
minimizing
the
importance
of
it,
but
i'm
not
saying
that
the
case
is
here
as
whether
that
that
is
the
issue
abstractly
stated
like
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
have
--
did
you
have
opportunity
to
comment
or
propose
counter
findings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
shall
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
i
shall
read
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
because
the
details
of
--
of
what's
happened
here,
it
seems
to
me
vide
of
any
proper
disposition
of
this
case
by
this
court,(inaudible)
the
case
is
very
important
one
on
that
question.
how
did
the
fact
that
the
findings
made
by
the
trial
judge
had
not
been
before
judge
smith
on
the
first
ground
come
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
see
i'd
find
it
very
difficult
to
understand
why
those
findings
were
not
in
the
first
instance
before
judge
smith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
the
--
how
do
i
know
i've
looked
at
this
finding?
how
do
i
know
what
these
findings
contained
unless
they
are
before
me?
and
how
could
judge
smith
know
what
those
findings
were
unless
they
were
before
him?
and
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
if
they
--
you
would
correct
me,
if
i'm
wrong,
they
thought
that
he
was
an
important
part
of
the
matter
out
of
which
the
conviction
arose,
the
evidentiary
matter,
that
was
not
before
the
habeas
corpus
judge,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
what
they
did
and
that's
why
we
--
that's
why
we
didn't
deny
without
comment.
that's
why
we
interpret
it,
if
you
please,
what
then
the
duty
of
judge
smith
was.
that's
the
whole
point
and
that's
why
a
reference
was
made
as
to
what
a
habeas
corpus
judge
is
to
consider
so
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
isn't
the
definitive
or
the
final
thing
with
reference
to
the
remand,
the
notation
by
this
court
is
denying
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
is
the
binding
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
well
be
right.
i'm
not
addressing
myself
with
that.
the
point
on
which
i
would
like
to
put
emphasis
is
that
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
which
they
were
available
as
what
not
to
in
the
many
instances
in
the
appendix
of
brown
and
allen,
where
there
were
these
formal
documents,
part
of
the
structure
you
call
it
of
the
connecticut
appellate
procedure
in
criminal
cases.
it
seems
to
me
difficult
to
understand
why
that
was
not
before
judge
smith
and
i
don't
mind
expressing
the
opinion.
it
probably
should've
been
and
should
be
before
judge
smith
and
the
other
habeas
corpus
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
--
isn't
it
the
respondents,
you
--
you
make
this
case
--
the
petitioner
or
whatever
you
call
him,
the
habeas
corpus
applicant
is
the
pillar
upon
whom
rest
the
responsibility
of
making
out
a
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
think
i
--
i
may
have
my
own
opinion
as
to
what
the
state
should
have
done,
but
that
doesn't
relief
the
responsibility
of
putting
before
a
habeas
corpus
judge
all
the
available
documentation
of
the
trial,
the
conviction
under
which
you
objected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
want
to
say
it
doesn't
theoretically,
it
reaches
the
very
core
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
mr.
pollak
gave
us
the
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
neither
of
you
has
argued
whether
this
confession
apart
from
isolating
this
factor
of
counsel
is
in
view
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
violated
of
our
standards
of
what
constitutes
a
voluntary
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
you
always
--
you
argued
on
judge
smith's
determination.
what
about
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
on
the
record
of
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
they
laid
down
the
right
standards
of
what
constitutes
voluntariness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
not
a
word
has
been
said
on
that
subject
until
i
now
elicited
that
answer
by
my
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
if
you're
right
about
that,
you
don't
need
anything
else,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
rogers
of
which
detain
to
as
witness?
at
what
point
did
he
(inaudible)
to
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
when
the
--
when
the
police
officers
--
was
your
office
represented
while
the
police
officers
were
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
the
prosecution
using
that
term
comprehensive,
prosecuting,
attending
from
the
plea
questioned
him
from
one
until
about
midnight,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
2
o'clock.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
then
questioned
as
a
detained
witness
without
being
a
suspect
also?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suspect,
so
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
ullman,
the
--
the
relation
of
a
suspect
to
his
lawyer
is
something
different
and
that
of
witness
to
take
about
whom
there's
no
suspicion
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
the
jailer
--
the
jailer's
testimony,
the
memory
of
mr.
pollak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
pollak
said
that
some
of
these
things
come
--
the
part
of
the
minutes
that
were
not
submitted
to
judge
smith
in
the
first
hearing
referred
to
jailer's
testimony,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it's
indicated
to
us
either
in
their
brief
or
your
brief,
what
portions
of
the
trial
minute
were
not
submitted
to
the
--
to
the
habeas
corpus
judge?
is
that
in
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
was
wondering
--
i
asked
is
--
i
was
wondering
whether
it
pertained
to
the
evidence
if
you
are
trying
to
recall
and
answer
to
chief
justice's
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
my
question
was
different.
i
--
i
understood
mr.
pollak
would
say
that
there
were
few
pages
of
the
original
trial
minutes
which
were
not
included
in
the
submission
of
trial
minutes
to
the
court,
to
the
--
judge
smith
at
the
first
hearing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
was
wondering
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
he
said
--
and
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
"testimony
of
a
jailer."
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
and
also
the
trial
minute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
but
also,
i
understood
mr
pollak
say
they
were
omitted
from
the
documents,
from
the
minutes
submitted
to
judge
smith
at
the
first
hearing,
a
few
pages,
he
didn't
indicate
how
many,
concerning
--
and
they
involved
testimony
among
others
of
a
jailer,
i
understood
him
to
say
that.
i
was
wondering
whether
this
testimony,
what
you're
trying
to
(inaudible)
and
he
says
to
his
question
was
part
of
the
stuff
that
was
not
submitted
to
judge
smith.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
i
misunderstood
mr.
pollak.
i
thought
he
said
that
all
the
testimony
bearing
on
the
visibility,
submitted
to
judge
maletz
if
that's
the
name
alone,
in
the
absence
of
the
jury
was
submitted,
but
part
of
the
testimony
before
the
jury
was
not
submitted,
i
believe
that
you
were
not
so.
never
mind,
evidently
i
am
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
now
--
you're
now
mr.
ullman
dealing
with
the
quality
of
--
of
the
statements,
as
it
were
i
mean,
whether
the
--
and
i
would
like
to
ask
you
if
i
may
a
--
a
few
question,
a
concession,
you
ranked
one
of
them.
the
length
of
this
interrogation,
you
said
it
was
from
1
o'clock,
1
p.m.
to
2
a.m.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
2
p.m.--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
2
p.m.
to
2
a.m.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hours
--
how
many
hours
of
interrogation
followed
from
2
p.m.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
--
and
i
would
like
you
to
give
the
answers
based
on
the
testimony
before
judge
maletz,
is
that
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
many
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon?
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although,
that
was
sent.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
he's
going
to
come
to
the
circumstances
of
the
interrogation?
it
was
then
intermittently
between
2
p.m.
and
10:15,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
many
--
how
many
interrogators
were
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
beginning
at
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
2
o'clock
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
how
many
were
in
the
room?
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
beginning
at
8
o'clock
so
that
--
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
from
between
2
and
8,
how
many
interrogators?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
--
but
it
did
last
intermittently
from
two
days,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
after
that
time,
he
--
he
did
not
leave
any
statement
or
--
or
anything
that
could
be
called
of
him
saying,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
all
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
the
interrogators
were
dissatisfied
with
their
interrogation,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
dissatisfied
and
therefore
called
in
the
captain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
from
2
to
8,
intermittent
interrogation
by
at
least
three
police
officers
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
yield
doesn't
--
did
not
yield
the
desired
proof
or
he
did
not
bring
about
a
statement
that
ends
up
with
some
in
(inaudible)
and
he
took
hold
of
the
interrogation
from
8
until
10
continuously
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
fair
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
fair
to
say
that
he
was
questioned
continuously
by
captain
eagan
for
an
hour
and
that
did
not
produce
the
statement
that
captain
eagan
thought
he
ought
to
be
forthcoming
with
and
then
he
suggested
that
he'd
bring
the
influence,
it
that
means
word,
the
influence
of
his
wife
and
--
and
some
relation,
some
contact
with
reference
to
his
adopted
children,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
his
owned
children?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
(inaudible)
he
had
warmth
the
feeling
he
had
a
relation
with,
wasn't
he?
(inaudible)
counsel,
are
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
and
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
all
events,
he
--
he
was
--
he
made
some
suggestion
of
what
he
would
do
with
his
foster
children,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
the
police
you
indicated
a
minute
ago
the
--
that
he
talked
to
them,
they
went
out
to
try
to
confirm
or
to
verify
what
he
said,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
during
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
it
was
all
over
and
when
they
got
his
signed
statement,
signed
confession
and
the
man
who
then
came
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut,
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut,
what
did
it
--
on
what
ground
did
it
rest
the
admissibility
of
the
confession
as
being
voluntary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
try
to
their
opinion,
try
to
the
opinion
of
judge
wynn
because
it
--
it
was
voluntary.
the
question
is
whether
under
these
(inaudible)
the
question
is
whether
under
these
and
other
circumstances
of
the
case
that
conduct
being
used
to
defendant
to
confess
falsely
that
he
have
committed
the
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
very
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'll
leave
it
to
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
come
to
that
--
because
that
to
me
is
a
different
question.
i
thought
the
district
attorney
said
--
prosecuting
attorney
said
that
you
were
to
address
yourself
as
to
what
the
basis
on
which
the
connecticut
supreme
court
determined
whether
a
confession
is
voluntary
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
question,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
what
about
--
what
do
you
say
about
stating
in
(inaudible)
which
it
cites,
here
again
the
question
for
the
court,
i'm
reading
--
i'm
sorry
i've
got
the
connecticut
report
and
not
the
record.
on
page
174,
142
connecticut.
here
again,
the
questions
for
the
court
to
decide
what
or
whether
this
conduct
in
used
to
defendant
to
make
an
involuntary
and
hence,
untrue
statements
state
against
malm
122
connecticut,
130,
121
and
when
i
go
to
state
against
malm,
there
it
says
in
so
many
words
have
we
arguing
practically
was
corroborated
which
seems
--
which
is
under
our
standard
and
are
all
irrelevant
factor
of
the
equation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
don't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
after
all,
we
have
no
means
of
knowing
what
our
state
court
goes
on
except
by
the
word
he
refuses.
those
are
the
tools
of
our
profession
and
those
are
the
means
by
which
a
court
gives
the
ground
for
its
decisions.
and
when
it's
not
only
uses
it
says
quite,
not
false,
confess
false
and
inside
the
case
state
against
malm
which
says
explicitly
in
that
case
every
item
which
confirmed,
i
do
not
see
what
other
inferences
i
can
draw
except
that
if
a
confession
is
confirmed
as
to
its
truth,
its
negatives
or
at
least
undermined
and
qualified
any
deduction
of
involuntariness
to
be
drawn
in
getting
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
call
it
unfortunate.
to
me,
it's
--
it's
descriptive.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
of
course
he
--
that
is
the
ultimate
judicial
listless
paper
as
it
was,
but
what's
contained
in
the
listless
paper
is
what
he
tells
us.
namely,
it
reacts
that
way
if
--
if
it's
false
and
as
i
say,
he
would
lie
on
state
against
malm,
which
is
to
me
as
clear
as
anything
can
be
in
good
sunlight
that
in
that
case,
they
relied
on
confirmation
of
the
statement,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
rule
in
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
not
understand.
i
cannot
gather
that
from
reading
connecticut
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
supposed
it
got
the
highest
tribunal
in
the
state
in
order
to
--
for
it
to
determine
when
it
takes
the
case,
the
ground
on
which
the
case
rest,
(inaudible)
if
the
test
were
otherwise
in
connecticut,
they
would
have
found
it
voluntarily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
i
do
not
suppose
of
what
you
say.
the
defendant's
counsel
if
the
state
gets
a
verdict
and
then
submits
the
finding.
we
do
not
take
exceptions.
the
defendant
can
--
it
doesn't
take
exception
but
he
merely
makes
counter
finding.
like
you're
telling
us
now
as
if
there
were
no
proposed
counter
findings,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
should.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we've
got
to
distinguish
between
what
happens
and
what
it
means.
those
are
two
very
different
things.
what
objectively
happened
and
what
it
means,
those
are
very
different
things.
and
i
thought
that
brown
and
allen
meant
that
there
was
not
to
be
a
reexamination
of
what
happened,
but
there
was
to
be
indeed
under
the
essential
constitutional
question
what
it
means.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
(inaudible)
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
if
he
hasn't
got
--
or
if
the
trial
isn't
documented
as
in
so
many
(voice
overlap),
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
one
that
i
asked
pollak.
under
your
procedure
in
connecticut,
is
your
supreme
court
restricted
to
the
formal
findings
so
that
they
can
travel
outside
of
them,
a,
as
to
anything
that
--
as
to
which
there
is
no
findings,
or
b,
may
go
to
the
record,
the
stenographic
minute
and
say,
"this
finding
is
not
substantiated
by
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
be
sure
that
you
get
my
question.
there
are
127
findings
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
on
a
particular
point
that
seems
relevant
to
the
total
result
for
the
supreme
--
for
your
supreme
court
of
errors,
there
is
no
finding,
may
they
go
to
the
record
and
--
and
themselves
to
extract
the
finding
from
the
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore
--
therefore,
the
habeas
corpus
judge
in
dealing
with
what
you
call
the
historical
fact
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
not
in
precinct
within
the
findings.
he
may
read
the
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
enlighten
the
finding.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
may
he
go
if
he
can
say,
"well,
in
reading
the
record,
i
can
dig
out
symbol
d
myself."
he
can
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
because
if
he
does
that,
he
still
doesn't
travel
outside
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
--
the
road
that
the
state
court
had
traveled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
if
he
can
say,
"gee,
there
was
--
here
was
the
testimony
of
--
of
the
defendant
and
as
i
read
his
testimony,
he
reads
like
a
truthful
man
and
there
were
three
policemen
and
they
were
too
slick.
and
yet
the
trial
court
took
the
testimony
of
the
three
policemen
who
rejected
that
of
the
two
seeming
defendants.
i
think
i'll
hear
those
witnesses
myself."
you
say
he
has
no
right
to
do
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
he
refused
to
allow
the
defendant
to
cross-examine
the
policemen.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
he
ruled
that
the
policemen's
testimony
has
great
presumptive
truth
value
and
therefore,
you
can't
cross-examine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
said
he
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
said
he
didn't
make
counter
proposal
with
reference
to
the
question
of
counsel.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
--
not
he
did
say
that
you
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
they
agreed
--
they
agreed
to
this
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
--
can
you
refer
to
the
charge
to
which
the
supreme
court
referred
when
it
said
--
questioned
that
the
jury
have
to
decide
in
this
connection
with
whether
the
impact
of
the
officer's
conduct
on
the
mind
of
the
defendant
was
such
as
--
was
likely
result
in
an
involuntary
or
untrue
statement?
would
you
mind
turning
to
the
charge
and
see
the
words
used
by
the
judge
if
he
tells
him
to
do
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
never
mind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
thought
he
did
charge.
