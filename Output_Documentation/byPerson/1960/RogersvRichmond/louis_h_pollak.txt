mr.
louis
h.
pollak
may
it
please
the
court.
this
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
brings
before
this
court,
a
murder
conviction
and
sentence
of
death
which
are
now
six
years
old.
it
is
a
conviction
and
death
sentence
which
judge
smith
formally
of
the
district
court
in
hartford,
and
recently
elevated
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
has
twice
had
occasions
to
say
was
obtained
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
how
then
does
it
come
that
we
are
here
as
petitioners
complaining
of
a
failure
to
grant
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus?
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
case
is
one
which
raises
at
the
most
dramatic
and
hazardous
level
of
life
itself.
the
question
of
the
vitality
of
the
constitutional
rights
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
and
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute
designed
to
vindicate
those
rights.
this
case
comes
here.
i
think
this
court
knows
for
the
third
time.
the
first,
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
errors
of
connecticut
on
direct
review.
a
petition
which
was
denied,
a
petition
which
raised
questions
of
the
validity
of
petitioner's
murder
conviction
based
on
contentions
that
incriminating
statements
were
admitted
in
evidence
against
them
at
trial
which
were
coerced
and
further
that
he
was
twice
before
each
of
those
incriminating
statements
were
elicited,
twice
denied
access
to
his
already
retained
counsel.
after
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
1956,
habeas
corpus
proceedings
before
judge
smith
were
instituted
which
resulted
in
a
grant
of
habeas
corpus
by
him,
a
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
a
denial
by
this
court
of
certiorari,
a
denial
however
accompanied
as
this
court
will
remember
by
an
opinion,
a
memorandum
opinion
construing
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
an
opinion
which
is
at
357
u.s.
220
and
which
is
reprinted
at
page
14
of
our
brief.
the
case
comes
here
today
on
a
grant
of
certiorari
by
this
court
last
february,
a
grant
to
review
the
court
of
appeals
affirmance
of
judge
smith's
ultimate
reluctant
denial
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
a
denial
of
company
as
i've
said
by
his
second
assertion.
harold
rogers
has
been
convicted
by
the
state
of
connecticut
and
sentenced
to
death
by
the
state
of
connecticut
in
defiance
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
the
case
stands
today,
it
presents
to
this
court,
three
issues.
the
two
initially
raised
on
review,
unsuccessful
petition
for
certiorari
from
the
state
supreme
court,
the
coercive
character
of
the
incriminating
statements
admitted
against
petitioner,
and
the
questions
of
denial
of
counsel.
and
third,
and
this
is
--
at
this
point
perhaps
the
dominant
question
in
the
case,
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
which
can
be
made
by
the
federal
district
court
sitting
in
habeas
corpus
when
that
inquiry
goes
beyond
the
inquiry
already
made
by
the
state
trier
whether
in
court
or
jury
which
has
already
considered
in
some
degree
the
constitutional
claims
of
the
applicants.
in
this
case,
the
problems
involved
whether
the
district
judge
is
bound
by
so-called
factual
findings
of
the
state
trier,
whether
the
district
judge
may
take
testimony
to
amplify
whatever
light
is
thrown
by
the
state
transcript.
i
submit
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
is
the
state
trial
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
that
is
the
core
of
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
certainly
will
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
there
has
been
confusion
and
precisely
because
of
that
mr.
justice
that
the
program
i
planned
for
myself
involved
just
your
recommendation.
before
i
enter
into
my
description
of
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
no
i
--
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
i
will
--
i
will
take
comfort
in
--
in
some
of
the
opinions
in
judge
clark's
opinion
for
instance,
but
i
think
there
has
been
a
confusion
and
i
will
attempt
to
see
if
we
can
eliminate
that
confusion
for
this
court
because
certainly
precisely
the
issue
to
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
pointed.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
--
i
believe
judge
clark
was
expressing
commiseration
with
judge
smith
for
a
very
natural
confusion
to
which
he
was
subjected
by
the
opinions,
all
of
them
which
have
been
the
cited
opinions,
i
do
believe
that
that
will
try
to
develop
that
judge
smith
was
in
error
in
his
construction
of
what
this
court
ordered
him
to
do,
but
i
will
address
myself,
mr.
justice
precisely
to
what
you
requested
and
direct
myself
to.
if
i
may
do
it
in
this
sequence,
may
i
say
before
i
begin
my
description
of
the
course
of
this
case
here,
that
my
colleague,
mr.
zeldes
who
has
been
concerned
with
this
case,
since
he
was
a
student
at
the
(inaudible)
law
school
four
years
ago
will
develop
the
separate
issue
of
access
to
counsel,
to
the
extent
that
that
is
an
issue
separate
from
the
denial
of
counsel
as
a
coercive
element
in
the
confessions,
which
we
challenge
the
validity
of.
i
will
then
direct
myself
to
the
course
of
this
case
from
the
beginning
to
how
it
got
here
with
an
attempt
to
make
claim
just
what
was
before
each
tribunal
at
each
stage
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
may
it
please
the
court.
when
i
left
this
building
yesterday
evening,
after
we
have
just
begun
this
argument,
i
must
confess
that
for
a
moment
i
felt
a
little
disjointed,
as
if
living
somewhat
of
an
island.
i
was
moving
back
into
the
mainstream
of
a
nation
which
was
concerned,
not
with
problems
of
this
kind,
but
with
a
national
election.
and
--
and
then
as
i
thought
about
it
a
little
more,
i
thought,
"well,
perhaps
that
isn't
so."
perhaps,
the
two
hallmarks
of
a
free
nation
are
the
exercise
of
the
ballot,
freely
and
secretly,
and
a
fair
trial,
and
of
indication
of
the
rights
of
every
man
to
equal
justice
before
the
law
for
which
this
court
sits.
and
so
i
returned
today
thinking
that
our
mission
here
is
perhaps
more
important
than
it
was
than
i
thought
it
was
even
yesterday.
i
indicated
yesterday
that
it
was
my
purpose
to
direct
myself
to
the
dominant
issue
of
the
scope
of
the
inquiry
which
the
federal
judge
sitting
in
habeas
corpus
is
to
make
when
he
is
faced
with
an
application
for
the
writ
and
the
issue.
the
constitutional
issues
are
issues
which
have
been
at
least
inquired
into
to
some
extent
in
the
state
courts.
and
that
my
colleague,
mr.
zeldes,
will
address
himself
to
the
somewhat
separable
issue
of
access
to
counsel
as
a
constitutional
right
by
itself,
perhaps
as
separate
from
the
coercive
character
of
the
incriminating
statements
submitted
against
petitioner
in
the
state
murder
trial.
i
am
not
going
to
--
of
necessity,
as
i
describe
the
events
in
this
case,
i
will
be
describing
how
the
incriminating
statements
were
elicited,
but
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
that
it
is
not
my
purpose
so
much
to
be
arguing
that
constitutional
issues
of
coercion
as
to
make
it
plain,
how
they
arose
and
who
considered
those
issues
so
that
this
court
can
best
be
acquainted
with
what
bears
on
the
inquiry,
which
the
habeas
corpus
court
should
be
making
and
this
i
hope
will
in
part
be
responsive
to
justice
frankfurter's
very
proper
inquiry
yesterday
as
to
just
who
said
what,
to
what
tribunal,
when
and
what
did
the
state
supreme
court
and
subsequently,
federal
judge
smith
sitting
in
the
district
court
have
before
him.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
of
course.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
no,
mr.
justice.
i
think
this
case
could
be
disposed
of
on
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
for
this
court
to
reach
the
merits.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
the
lower
court
did.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
we
--
we
have
such
a
judgment.
i
--
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
--
i
don't
believe
there
is,
justice
frankfurter.
i
think
the
issue
could
be
reached
in
several
ways.
the
issue
could
be
reached
on
the
basis
of
the
record
which
judge
smith
on
the
court
of
appeals
have
held
that
they
are
limited
to
at
this
phase
of
the
case.
it
could
be
reached
on
the
basis
of
the
record
which
judge
smith
addressed
himself
to
at
the
first
habeas
corpus
hearing,
or
indeed
as
judge
clark
dealt
with
the
merits
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below.
it
seems
to
me
this
court
could
if
it
wished,
though
i
don't
urge
one
course
rather
than
the
other
on
this
court.
it
seems
to
me
this
court
could
address
itself
to
the
merits
of
the
coercion
issue
on
the
basis
of
the
state
transcript
itself.
but,
i
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
--
i
agree.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
that
is
correct.
now,
if
i
may
take
the
liberty
in
response
to
justice
frankfurter's
question
yesterday
afternoon,
mr.
zeldes
and
i
have
attempted
to
facilitate
this
court's
understanding
of
this
very
confusing
record
for
which
i
make
no
apologies.
it's
an
amalgam
of
connecticut
procedure
and
the
handy
work
of
other
attorneys
and
this
is
the
printed
record
we
have.
to
thread
our
way
through
it,
mr.
zeldes
has
prepared
a
compilation
of
what
witnesses
testified
before
the
state
trial
judge,
what
before
the
jury,
which
of
that
testimony
went
to
the
state
supreme
court
and
what
are
that
came
before
judge
smith
at
which
phase
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
necessarily,
this
has
been
done
in
haste
and
we
have
only
just
had
opportunity
to
give
a
copy
to
mr.
ullmann
and
mr.
zampano.
this
--
this
document
in
--
in
duplicate
form
is
available.
if
it
will
be
of
service
to
the
court,
i
would
offer
it
to
the
court
either
now
or
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
that
is
simply
a
tabular
indication
of
what
witnesses'
testimony
was
disposed
of,
in
what
fashion
before,
what
tribunal
at
what
phase
of
the
case.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
counsel
has
been
furnished
with
a
copy
of
five
minutes
to
12
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
--
mr.
chief
justice,
and
should
not
be
bound
by
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
--
certain
limitation.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
to
summarize
this
case
in
brief
as
compass,
petitioner
was
arrested
in
january
of
1954
on
a
charge
of
attempted
robbery.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
at
the
trial
and
i
will
--
i
will
--
but
i
will
attempt
mr.
justice
to
distinguish
as
i
go
forward.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
four
days
later,
having
hired
an
attorney
of
the
late
thomas
robinson,
public
defender
of
new
haven,
but
hire
--
having
hired
mr.
robinson
in
his
private
capacity,
petitioner
appeared
before
the
city
court
waived
examination
when
it
was
bound
over
to
the
april
term
for
trial
on
a
robbery
charge.
he
remained
in
custody
and
two
weeks
thereafter
on
january
30th,
he
was
suddenly,
on
a
saturday,
taken
without
any
court
order,
which
would
be
required
under
the
connecticut
procedure,
taken
from
the
county
jail
to
the
state
attorney's
office,
mr.
ullmann's
office,
where
he
was
interrogated
from
approximately
noon
or
1
o'clock
to
the
completion
of
the
interrogation
after
midnight.
very
briefly,
he
found
himself
of
being
interrogated
about
a
charge
of
murder
which
related
to
a
murder
which
had
taken
place
some
three
months
before,
two
or
three
months
before.
he
found
himself
at
the
outset
confronted
by
a
gun,
which
allegedly
had
been
in
his
custody
when
arrested
and
which
was
now
sought
to
be
linked
to
that
murder.
he
at
once,
according
to
his
testimony
before
the
state
trial
judge,
the
preliminary
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
his
statement,
at
once
asked
to
see
his
counsel,
his
already
retained
lawyer
and
there
is
no
contradiction
by
any
witness
that
he
did
--
no
contradiction
by
any
witness
in
the
state
court
proceeding
that
he
did
make
such
a
request
at
once.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
is
the
testimony
of
petitioner
rogers
which
begins
at
page
239
and
on
241
if
you
--
your
honor
please.
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
petitioner
testified
--
i
said
i
wanted
--
the
question,
"who
was
your
lawyer
at
that
time?
mr.
robinson
and
you."
mr.
corsi
was
doing
the
examining
before
the
trial
judge
maletz.
did
you
tell
sergeant
mullhern
that
mr.
robinson
was
your
lawyer?
no,
he
didn't
answer
me.
i
didn't
name
him.
i
said
i
wanted
to
see
my
lawyer.
that's
all."
and
more
of
the
same.
this
is
at
page
241
of
the
state
record.
now,
this
was
testimony
to
the
trial
judge.
this
testimony
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
errors.
rogers
did
not
testify
before
the
jury,
nor
did
rogers
testify
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
rogers
of
course
testified
before
judge
smith
on
habeas
corpus
into
the
same
effect.
before
judge
smith,
that
testimony
was
contradicted
by
police
officers
who
were
present
at
that
state
of
the
interrogation.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
there
was
no
contradiction
of
that,
your
honor.
there
was
contradiction
by
chief
eagan,
a
detective
who
was
present
from
eight
in
the
evening
on
who
denied
that
--
at
that
subsequent
time,
the
petitioner
asked
for
his
lawyer.
but
there
was
no
contradiction
on
the
state
record
even
though
the
officers
were
available
in
the
state
trial
during
the
trial.
there
was
no
contradiction
before
judge
maletz
of
the
testimony
to
which
i
refer
to
you.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
ullman
advises
me
very
kindly
that
it's
page
233.
yes,
that
is
correct.
under
the
center
of
the
page,
"at
any
time
that
he
expressed
the
desire
to
see
his
attorney,
he
did
not."
now,
at
other
places,
mr.
--
chief
eagan
indicated
that
he
had
no
personal
knowledge
and
could
have
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
what
transpired
before
that
time.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
chief
eagan
headed
the
interrogation
at
8
o'clock
in
the
evening
after
it
was
on
--
on
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
he's
been
there.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
since
about
1
o'clock
or
between
12
and
1.
the
--
the
record
is
perhaps
little
cloudy
as
to
that.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
still
in
--
in
mr.
ullman's
office.
mr.
ullman
himself
wasn't
there,
but
that
was
the
--
that
was
before
him.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
there
was
no
corroboration,
no,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
know
in
the
nature
of
things
how
it
could
have
been
obtained
as
the
issue
was
tried
out
before
judge
smith.
as
i
say
there,
there
was
denial
in
the
sense
that
at
last
the
state
called
the
policemen
who
were
interrogating
at
the
time
and
they
denied
it
and
judge
smith
recognized
the
conflict
and
said,
"it
seems
to
me
enormously
probable
that
a
man
who
had
retained
a
lawyer
would
have
asked
for
him
and
i
tend
to
believe
--
i
do
believe
the
petitioner.
i
may
say,
mr.
justice,
that
at
the
trial
of
the
issue
before
judge
maletz
in
the
state
court
at
petitioners'
counsel
said
having
elicited
rogers'
testimony
and
the
fact
that
chief
eagan
could
only
dispute
it
with
respect
to
a
much
later
period,
said,
"i
assume
that
the
state
will
want
to
introduce
witnesses."
and
the
patrolmen
were
sitting
--
the
officers
were
sitting
in
the
courtroom,
will
want
to
produce
witnesses
with
respect
to
this
proof
of
period
of
time
and
no
such
witnesses
were
brought
forward.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
the
supreme
court
did
not
reject
that
testimony.
i
find
--
i
think
their
opinion
conceivably
is
ambiguous,
but
if
i
would
read
it
as
a
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
it
is
explicit
on
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
but
it
is
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
is
correct
and
it
seems
to
me,
if
i
may
say
so,
especially
taking
in
context
with
justice
o'sullivan's
dissent
that
the
state
supreme
court
assumed
that
he
had
in
fact
asked
for
his
lawyer
notwithstanding
the
one
so-called
finding
which
has
assumed
such
enormous
importance
in
this
case.
judge
maletz
says
finding
to
the
contrary
or
finding
--
we
say
unsupported
by
evidence
and
a
finding
which,
if
the
court
please,
was
merely
represented
the
judge's
subscription
five
months
later
of
an
assertion,
a
summation
made
to
him
and
submitted
to
him
by
the
state's
attorney
as
part
of
the
appellate
process.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
on
the
next
day.
that
is
true,
mr.
justice.
and
of
course,
the
state
supreme
court
did
also
accept
as
it
must
as
there's
been
no
contradiction
at
any
point
that
on
the
second
day,
prior
to
the
hearing
before
the
coroner,
petitioners'
counsel
came
to
the
jail
to
see
petitioner
and
was
denied
access
on
order
of
the
coroner,
an
order
reinforced
by
a
call
from
the
jailer
to
the
state's
attorney's
office
who
said
yes
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
justice,
i
--
i
don't
recall
whether
there's
a
finding
on
that.
there
is,
as
mr.
zeldes
points
out,
testimony
by
two
of
the
officers
before
judge
smith
that
they
knew
that
--
that
petitioner
had
retained
mr.
robinson.
i
don't
recall
though
that
there's
any
finding
to
that
effect.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
this
is
a
most
puzzling
question,
mr.
justice.
i
think
the
answer
is
--
i'm
sure
the
answer
is
that
in
many
circumstances,
they
can
go
to
the
evidence
if
the
findings
are
in
one
sense
or
another
insufficient
or
inadequate.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
primer
on
appellate
procedure
in
connecticut,
chief
justice
motley,
his
work
on
the
subject,
sections
130
and
131
in
the
case
of
state
versus
mccarthy,
a
capital
case
some
years
ago
in
connecticut.
the
connecticut
supreme
court
did
take
occasion
to
go
back
to
the
evidence
when
troubled
by
finding
and
pointed
out
that
it
was
entitled
to
do
so
and
should
do
so
especially
in
a
capital
case
to
assure
itself
for
the
protection
of
the
interest
of
the
accused
in
a
capital
case
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
justice,
among
the
other
findings,
there
isn't
is
a
case
which
i
can
give
you
on
that
point
in
connecticut,
but
i'm
--
to
the
extent
that
i
can
understand
the
connecticut
cases,
they
would
all
be
consistent
with
the
answer
that
you
would
expect
that,
but
of
course
they
could
go
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
i
--
i
think
that's
plain
on
--
well,
on
the
face
of
judge
motley
excellent
summation
in
his
volume
on
appellate
procedure,
but
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
as
to
saying
that
i
can
provide
you
with
a
holding
of
that
effect.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
now,
i
seem
to
have
--
i
only
have
five
minutes
before
i
yield
to
my
colleague
mr.
zeldes,
so
if
i
may
very
much
compress
what
comes
hereafter.
let
me
merely
remind
you
that
before
the
end
of
--
of
the
interrogation
in
the
state's
attorney's
office,
the
decisive
moment
was
after
chief
eagan
entered,
he
placed
--
he
--
he
warned
petitioner
that
he
was
going
to
call
in
petitioner's
wife
and
put
his
foster
children
in
custody
and
preceded
to
make
a
phone
call
directing
his
--
his
subordinates
to
get
ready
to
apprehend
mrs.
rogers
and
that
phone
call
concededly
by
his
own
statement
was
on
a
dead
telephone.
it
was
a
fake.
he
said
to
the
judge
it
was
done
for
the
sake
--
he
agreed
that
it
was
to
make
it
plain
to
rogers
the
advisability
of
making
a
statement.
to
the
jury,
chief
eagan
went
further.
he
acknowledged
that
it
was
--
that
he
told
rogers
you
would
be
"less
than
half
a
man."
you
let
us
bring
in
your
wife.
and
an
hour
went
by,
the
chief
began
to
move
as
if
to
phone
again
and
petitioner
then
began
the
first
incriminating
statement.
the
second
statement
came
a
day
later
in
the
coroner's
office
after
the
coroner
had
made
sure,
after
the
coroner,
one,
had
issued
a
--
his
own
form
of
warrant
to
detain
rogers
as
a
suspect
for
murder
and
two,
had
accompanied
that
with
an
order
that
no
one
be
allowed
to
see
rogers,
and
immediately
that
had
impact
in
the
sense
of
barring
rogers'
attorney
who
at
noon
on
sunday
came
to
see
rogers
at
the
jail
and
was
denied
admission,
a
denial
confirmed
on
a
phone
call
by
the
jailer
to
mr.
ullman's
office
and
the
jailer
recalled
to
mr.
ullman.
and
five
hours
later,
rogers
was
taken
to
the
coroner's
office,
interrogated.
the
coroner
says
he
warned
him
of
his
right,
assured
him
of
his
right
to
have
assistance
of
counsel.
he
agreed
in
testimony
before
the
trial
court
that
this
was
a
stop
warning.
the
coroner
apparently
was
free
to
give
that
assurance
of
right
to
counsel
having
already
taken
steps
to
see
to
it,
steps
which
had
to
take
an
effect
that
counsel
would
not
get
to
see
petitioner.
now,
these
were
the
statements
that
were
admitted
in
evidence
against
rogers,
which
led
to
his
conviction,
a
conviction
sustained
by
the
state
supreme
court.
the
further
steps,
i
think
this
court
knows,
that
judge
smith
granted
the
writ,
having
before
him
--
taking
testimony,
both
offered
by
petitioner
and
by
the
state
without
objection
on
either
side
and
taking
all
the
documentary
evidence
of
the
state
proceedings
that
was
submitted
to
him
and
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
that
was
submitted
by
the
petitioner.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
petitioner
was
the
moving
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
now,
i
--
if
i'm
wrong
on
this,
i'm
--
i
hope
and
i'm
sure
that
either
mr.
zeldes
or
mr.
ullman
will
--
will
correct
me,
but
i
believe
that
petitioners
submitted
to
judge
smith
virtually
--
well,
what
came
before
judge
smith
was
all
of
the
testimony
which
was
before
judge
maletz
with
the
exception
of
about
four
genuinely
inconsequential
pages,
which
judge
clark
discusses
in
his
dissent
below.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
of
the
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
believe
there
was
and
i'm
--
i'm
told
that
it
was
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
--
and
almost
but
not
quite
complete
transcript
that
was
in
petitioners'
possession.
i
--
i
know
that
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
don't
think
there
was
any
problem
of
access
to
the
--
to
the
state
transcript.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
believe
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
that.
i
believe
that
what
was
submitted,
mr.
justice,
was
everything
that
petitioner
conceived
possibly
to
bear
on
the
issues
and
what
--
and
i
think
the
test
of
this
is
that
when
that
record
was
amplified
on
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals,
the
only
further
testimony
that
came
in
were
these
two
or
three
pages
of
testimony
by
the
jailer
and
the
sheriff
as
to
their
procedures
in
keeping
custody
of
--
of
the
prisoner,
letting
him
out
although
without
court
order
to
mr.
ullman's
detective
and
began
denying
mr.
corsi,
petitioner's
attorney
access
to
and
this
was
the
only
testimony
that
was
added
to
the
record
on
remand.
the
only
other
item
being
the
so-called
findings
by
judge
maletz,
which
were
not
offered
to
--
to
judge
smith.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
the
findings
did.
yes,
they
did,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
it's
certainly
appropriate
to
ask
and
i
have
no
way
of
answering
responsively
except
perhaps
for
the
feeling
of
the
--
the
finding
were,
if
you
will,
an
--
an
irrelevant,
an
--
an
--
a
virtually
irrelevant
document
as
i
really
think
they
should
be
treated
to
be
an
assistance
in
the
state
process
of
adjudication,
which
really
throws
very
little
light
on
anything
decided
by
judge
maletz
since
he
had
made
his
decision
on
the
confessions
five
months
before.
i
don't
--
i
don't
say
that
we
would
have
any
objection
of
that
being
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
think
--
if
your
honor
please,
if
they
are
irrelevant
to
the
inquiry
to
be
made
by
judge
smith.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
may
i
--
may
i
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice.
they're
not
irrelevant
in
the
sense
that
i
would
have
any
objection
to
their
being
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
mr.
justice,
perhaps
i
misstated
myself.
it's
an
entirely
proper
document,
but
i
think
the
irrelevance
of
it,
the
practical
irrelevance
of
it
for
the
purposes
to
which
judge
smith
on
this
court
should
be
directing
itself
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
the
state
supreme
court
obviously
assumed
that
the
findings
with
respect
to
the
only
--
only
disputed
fact
in
the
whole
record,
the
request
for
counsel
at
the
first
interrogation
obviously
assumed
that
those
fact
"finding"
by
judge
maletz
was
not
in
any
way
an
obstacle
to
a
determination
of
petitioner's
legal
rights.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
of
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
mr.
justice,
i
don't
believe
we're
in
disagreement
or
perhaps
you
disagree
with
me,
but
i
don't
--
with
all
deference
think
that
i
disagree
with
you.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
the
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yesterday,
you
instructed
counsel
that
it
was
his
function
to
disagree
with
the
court
and
i
--
well,
push
you
quite
that
far,
but
i
--
i
do
think,
if
your
honor
pleases,
that
the
--
the
issue
as
to
whether
petitioner
requested
his
counsel,
though
obviously
not
this
positive
of
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
i've
--
i've
already
trespassed
on
my
colleague's
time
and
i
will
try
to
return
to
this
in
the
time
that
i'm
saving
for
rebuttal,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
series
of
issues
i'd
like
to
address
myself
too
quickly.
counsel
for
respondent
has
said
that
we
filed
no
counter
findings.
that
was
not
our
posture
in
the
state
appellate
process.
this
is
a
copy
of
the
findings
which
were
filed,
a
counter
findings
were
filed
by
the
state's
attorney.
we
were
the
appellant
and
the
so-called
"comprehensive
finding
by
judge
maletz
contains
the
appellant's
proposed
finding
and
adapt
of
course
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
--
mr.
ullman's
submitted
finding.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
but
our
--
but
our
proposed
finding
indicate
as
the
--
indicates
of
the
state
supreme
court
may
claim
our
view
on
the
matter
of
counsel.
with
respect
to
whether
the
state
supreme
court
can
go
behind
the
finding,
i
was
remissed.
i
should
have
pointed
this
out
in
my
opening
affirmative
remarks
of
the
mccarthy
case
to
which
i
referred,
133
connecticut
of
179
was
cited
for
the
proposition
that
resort
maybe
had
to
the
evidence
whereby
thus
obtaining
a
full
statement
of
the
circumstances
a
conclusion
of
error
can
be
avoided,
was
cited
to
the
state
supreme
court
by
mr.
ullman
as
recently
as
this
last
spring
in
a
case
which
he
argued
there
connecticut
versus
harris.
a
case
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
well,
good.
i
wanted
to
be
sure
there
was
no
question
on
this.
the
chief
justice
inquired
when
the
incommunicado
status
was
lifted
and
mr.
justice
douglas
discovered
the
finding
relevant
to
that,
i
only
want
to
add
the
coroner's
own
testimony
at
page
261
that
he
lifted
that
status
as
of
the
following
monday
or
maybe
tuesday,
a
day
or
two
later.
coroner
--
coroner
corrigan
so
testified
on
page
261
of
the
record.
justice
whittaker
inquired
whether
there
was
a
possible
finding
by
judge
maletz
that
the
petitioner
was
not
entitled
to
be
credited
on
the
issue
of
request
for
counsel.
there
was
certainly
no
such
finding
made
by
judge
maletz
whether
one
could
speculate
that
there
could
be
such
a
supporting
finding
would
be
--
bring
us
purely
into
the
area
of
conjecture.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
in
his
questions
demonstrated
better
than
i
can
the
insufficiency
of
the
connecticut
supreme
court's
analysis
of
the
admissibility
under
this
court's
test
of
a
confession.
they
certainly
were
applying
a
truthfully
test.
and
indeed
on
page
235
--
i
beg
your
pardon,
225
of
our
record,
at
the
top
of
that,
the
connecticut
supreme
court
indicated
that
it
was
even
up
to
the
jury
to
determine.
i
point
you
to
the
first
sentence
of
page
225
whether
the
confession
was
involuntary
or
untrue,
which
supports
our
view
that
not
only
at
the
state
supreme
court
level
but
at
the
trial
level
before
judge
maletz
and
before
the
jury.
the
issue
of
truth
and
falsity
was
intermixed
with
the
voluntariness
issue.
a
point
that
we
have
covered
at
length
in
our
reply
brief
in
which
i
think
tends
to
show
the
inadequacy
of
the
state
reviewing
procedure
and
the
greater
and
greater
momentum
behind
amplifying
the
record
before
judge
smith.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
do
not
recall
that
the
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
--
that
the
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
i
do
not
recall
that
the
judge
--
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
--
put
to
jury
the
issue
untruthful.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
but
a
--
but
the
argument
made
to
judge
maletz
by
mr.
ullman
was
implicit
--
explicit
with
the
--
with
the
factor
of
truthfulness.
to
the
extent
that
the
issue
that
this
court
seeks
to
address
itself
to
is
the
facts
uncontradicted
on
the
state
record.
i
refer
this
court
to
judge
clark's
succinct
summary
of
those
facts
on
the
state
record
at
page
49
of
our
brief.
the
inadequacy
of
the
state
adjudication
at
the
trial
and
at
the
appellate
level
in
our
view,
the
inadequacy
of
that
adjudication
as
to
the
nature
of
this
coercion
--
confessions
is
--
is
at
the
greatest
weight
to
the
view
that
when
this
court
denied
certiorari
to
review
directly
a
decision
of
a
state
court
sustaining
a
conviction,
it
--
it
is
the
--
it
is
incumbent
on
the
federal
district
court
to
which
an
application
for
habeas
corpus
then
goes
to
make
that
wider
inquiry
which
will
illuminate
the
insufficient
state
record,
and
we
think
this
is
what
judge
smith
did
here
in
this
case
at
his
first
attempt.
if
--
if
i
may
simply
in
conclusion
make
two
further
points.
even
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
its
first
view
suggested
the
permissibility
that
some
more
testimony
might
be
taken
before
judge
smith,
testimony
which
mr.
ullman
conceded,
i
point
you
to
page
38
of
our
brief,
would
go
to
an
issue
like
the
request
for
counsel,
which
has
obtained
such
importance.
mr.
ullman
seemed
conceded
that
on
remand
before
judge
smith,
that
--
that
judge
smith
was
entitled
to
take
testimony
on
such
an
issue.
in
conclusion,
it
is
our
view
that
brown
versus
allen
permits
the
taking
of
such
testimony
that
judge
reed
--
justice
reed
so
said
in
describing
the
speller
case
as
it
was
processed
in
this
court
and
that
the
judgment
therefore
below
should
be
reversed
with
directions
from
this
court
to
grant
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
louis
h.
pollak
thank
you.
