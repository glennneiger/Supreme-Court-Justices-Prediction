mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
present
posture
of
this
case,
great
emphasis
has
been
placed
on
the
so-called
state
court
findings
of
fact.
mr.
pollak
has
already
addressed
himself
to
these
findings
somewhat
and
i
want
to
add
a
few
comments,
if
i
may.
i
want
to
emphasize
of
the
outset
that
these
are
verbatim
adaptions
supplied
to
the
trial
court
in
connecticut
under
the
connecticut
procedure
by
the
state's
attorney
and
were
filed
five
months
after
the
trial.
they
are
set
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
connecticut
procedure
which
is
outlined
in
our
brief
at
page
25
in
a
lengthy
footnote,
the
appellant
first
files
a
draft
finding.
the
appellee
then
files
a
counter
finding
and
the
judge
takes
which
portions
of
these
two
documents
he
thinks
applicable
and
prepares
a
finding
for
appellate
purposes.
in
response
to
your
previous
inquiry
directed
to
professor
pollak
that
procedure
for
the
correction
of
the
finding
in
the
supreme
court
of
errors
is
such
that
one
of
the
standard
means
for
correction
is
failure
to
make
a
finding
on
material
evidence.
this
was
not
raised
in
the
usual
case
in
connecticut
because
the
finding
with
which
we
are
concerned,
that
so-called
findings
of
underlying
facts,
what
the
lower
courts
consider
that
to
be,
were
made
in
the
course
of
a
ruling
on
evidence
before
the
jury.
and
i
think,
if
your
honor
would
refer
to
the
footnote
of
page
25,
you
would
see
the
basic
structure
of
the
connecticut
appellate
system,
which
i
don't
feel
that
we
have
adequate
time
to
explain
the
detail
at
this
point.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
excuse
me
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
do
want
to
emphasize,
however,
that
under
the
decisions
of
all
the
courts
below,
the
exclusive
determination
of
the
constitutional
issue
must
be
made
on
these
finding
and
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
said
that
judge
smith
must
confine
himself
to
the
state
court
transcript,
which
was
created
at
the
time
these
confessions
were
admitted,
but
he
must
confine
himself
exclusively
to
the
findings
of
facts
filed
five
months
after
the
confessions
were
admitted.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
in
this
fashion,
your
honor,
the
findings
of
the
state
trial
judge
were
never
offered
by
either
party
at
--
at
the
original
habeas
corpus
hearing
of
august
31st,
1956.
neither
side
offered
it.
i
might
say
that
judge
smith
accepted
every
bit
of
documentary
evidence
offered
by
either
party.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
well,
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out
in
--
in
brown
against
allen,
the
crucial
findings
we're
dealing
with,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
delicate
balance
of
federal-state
relations
is
the
findings
relating
to
historical
facts.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
that
i
think
is
important
that
that
is
not
the
sole
basis
of
their
remand
instructions.
if
that
were
so,
we
might
not
be
here
today,
but
they
said,
"examine
the
transcript"
and
then,
"conclude
yourself."
and
this
is
under
the
interpretations
of
the
court.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
concur,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
but
we
feel
that
both
judge
smith
on
remand
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
second
opinion
have
ignored
the
command
of
this
court.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
may
say
this
directly
to
that
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
was
never
offered
by
the
respondent.
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
judge
smith
would
have
rejected
and
i
might
add
also
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
your
honor.
i
might
also
add
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
i
may
add
that
he
--
the
state
trial
--
the
testimony
given
before
the
state
trial
judge
was
for
--
before
judge
smith
except
for
the
testimony
of
two
witnesses
who
testified
in
person
before
judge
smith.
now,
the
record
on
appeal
before
the
supreme
court
of
errors,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
contained
these
so-called
findings
with
which
we
are
concerned.
those
are
reported
in
all
law
library
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
yes,
the
facts
are
very
important.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
crucial
issues
in
this
case,
your
honor,
are
whether
or
not
there
was
a
denial
of
petitioner's
constitutional
right
as
to
the
due
process.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
two
issues
which
have
been
raised
throughout
this
proceeding
at
all
stages
are
the
coercive
nature
of
the
confessions
and
whether
or
not
the
denial
of
counsel
in
itself,
regardless
of
the
voluntary
nature
of
the
confession
renders
the
confessions
inadmissible.
my
time
is
somewhat
limited.
i
had
prepared
to
--
to
discuss
the
right
to
counsel
as
it's
affected
here.
i
see
mr.
justice
douglas'
interest
in
the
compilation
which
we
have
set
forth
in
some
reform
for
this
purpose.
there
has
been
considerable
discussion
over
the
last
four
years
since
this
case
has
been
in
the
federal
court
over
what
testimony
judge
smith
heard
and
what
he
did
not
hear
and
what
he
should
have
heard.
it
is
our
position,
if
your
honor
please,
that
the
tribunal
on
august
31st
held
a
habeas
corpus
hearing.
petitioner
had
requested
a
hearing,
respondent
did
not
object
to
a
hearing.
petitioner
offered
witnesses
and
respondent
offered
witnesses.
the
issues
were
fully
litigated
before
judge
smith.
at
that
point,
respondent
filed
a
lengthy
affidavit
asking
judge
smith
to
reconsider
his
opinion
that
both
of
these
confessions
were
coerced
and
i
might
interject
for
just
a
moment
to
say
that
this
was
the
first
such
opinion
rendered
by
judge
smith
in
17
years
as
a
district
judge
in
the
district
--
in
the
section
of
the
state
in
which
he
hears
virtually
all
habeas
corpus
petitions
from
the
state
prison.
yet,
even
when
respondent
filed
his
affidavit
for
rehearing,
he
never
objected
to
the
propriety
of
the
hearing.
and
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fist
time,
respondent
objected
to
this
hearing
and
said
judge
smith
should
not
have
heard
all
of
these
testimony
and
the
conclusion
that
both
of
these
confessions
were
bad
on
the
basis
of
what
judge
smith
heard
and
saw
himself
in
the
federal
plenary
hearing
cannot
be
considered
by
the
court
below.
and
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
to
shackle
judge
smith
to
findings
filed
by
the
state
trial
court
for
appellate
purposes.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
i
would
urge
this
court
on
the
right
to
counsel
point
to
keep
in
mind
that
it's
relevant
in
two
respects,
as
one
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
surrounding
the
exaction
of
the
confessions.
in
a
long
line
of
cases
starting
with
brown
against
allen
which
will
i
--
i
will
not
repeat
now,
this
court
had
set
out
the
due
process
limits
on
the
use
of
challenged
confession.
i
urge
this
court
to
consider
the
denial
of
counsel
also
in
regard
to
what
five
justices
of
this
court
in
separate
opinions
seem
to
indicate,
renders
the
confessions
inadmissible
on
the
basis
of
the
denial
of
counsel
in
itself.
i
think
that
since
charges
were
filed
against
petitioner,
although
they
were
charges
on
another
crime,
that
he
is
entitled
to
his
absolute
right
to
counsel
in
a
capital
case,
and
that
the
resulting
confession
should
be
held
a
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
your
honor,
there
are
five
justices
in
this
court
who
have
accepted
that
position,
if
not,
in
one
opinion.
your
honor
is
correct
in
saying
that
it
has
been
rejected
by
the
majority
the
court
in
the
crooker
case
and
in
cicenia
versus
lagay.
but
i
feel
that
--
reading
the
opinions
of
this
court,
the
spano
concurrence
might
--
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
in
crooker
indicates
that
five
justices
now
feel
that
the
effective
way
to
protect
the
right
to
counsel
is
to
invalidate
a
resulting
confession
whether
or
not
it
is
voluntary
under
the
traditional
principle
set
forth
in
the
spano
case.
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
we
feel,
your
honor,
in
this
regard
that
judge
smith's
decision
in
validating
the
confessions
is
not
clearly
erroneous
and
that
mr.
ullman
had
never
claimed
so
for
the
state.
to
go
through
the
details
of
the
circumstances
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
if
your
honor
please,
in
--
in
way
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
supreme
court
of
errors
detailed
in
our
brief
used
a
standard
which
is
in
patent
conflict
with
the
decision
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
the
--
the
time
is
so
much
short
if
your
--
if
mr.
justice
--
mr.
jacob
d.
zeldes
that
is
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
for
this
reasons
therefore,
i
respectfully
request
that
this
court
reverse
the
judgment
below
and
remand
this
decision
to
judge
smith
with
instructions
to
issue
the
writ.
thank
you.
