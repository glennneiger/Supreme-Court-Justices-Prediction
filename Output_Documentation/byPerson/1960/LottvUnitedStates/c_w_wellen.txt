mr.
c.
w.
wellen
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
this
case
here
is
here,
as
a
result
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
this
is
an
income
tax
evasion
case.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
petitioners
were
illegally
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary.
it
involves
the
tax
returns
of
the
farnsworth
&
chambers
corporation,
for
that
corporation's
taxable
years,
1951
through
1954.
the
farnsworth
&
chambers
corporation
was
one
of
the
largest
construction
companies
in
the
united
states.
it
had
several
hundred
employees
and
during
the
period
in
question,
it
did
several
$100
millions
worth
of
business
involving
tens
of
thousands
of
separate
transactions.
the
corporation
was
owned
and
controlled
by
richard
a.
farnsworth
and
dunbar
n.
chambers.
together,
they
controlled
and
owned
74%
of
the
stock
of
the
corporation
and
through
a
stockholders'
agreement,
controlled
the
balance
of
the
stock
which
was
owned
by
certain
employees.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
among
them,
owned
7%
of
the
stock
at
the
corporation,
which
was
subject
to
the
stockholders'
agreement
and
therefore,
under
the
control
of
richard
farnsworth
and
dunbar
chambers.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
along
with
richard
farnsworth
were
indicted
in
the
spring
of
1958
for
aiding
the
corporation
in
evading
its
taxes.
dunbar
and
chambers,
the
other
substantial
stockholder,
would
undoubtedly
have
been
indicted
with
this
group,
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
he
was
killed
in
a
hunting
accident
some
months
earlier.
after
the
indictment
was
returned,
the
petitioners
each
pleaded
not
guilty.
they
then
filed
motions
to
dismiss
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
insufficient
and
void.
they
also
filed
motions
for
bills
of
particular
and
they
filed
a
motion
to
sever
their
case
from
that
of
mr.
farnsworth
on
the
ground
that
it
was
alleged
that
mr.
farnsworth
had
diverted
assets
and
income
from
the
corporation
to
himself,
whereas
the
petitioners
have
never
been
charged
with
profiting
from
the
alleged
wrongdoing,
nor
have
they've
been
charged
with
personal
income
tax
evasion.
it's
purely
the
affair
of
the
corporation.
the
government
supplied
the
petitioners
with
a
token
bill
of
particulars.
it
was
vague
and
meaningless.
and
the
petitioners
properly
requested
a
supplemental
bill
of
particulars,
which
was
denied.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
it
is
a
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
--
in
the
record,
your
honor.
it
--
it's
watchfully
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
--
reiterated
the
provisions
of
the
indictment.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
that's
my
characterization.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
that's
my
characterization.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
thereupon,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas
denied
all
of
petitioner's
pretrial
motions.
after
denial
of
all
of
their
pretrial
motions
and
after
the
death
of
their
leading
counsel,
mr.
malcolm
mccorquodale,
the
petitioners
elected
to
seek
re-arraignment
for
the
purpose
of
entering
pleas
of
nolo
contendere.
this
was
vigorously
opposed
for
the
government,
but
despite
the
opposition
of
the
government,
the
court
received
the
pleas
of
nolo
contendere.
thereupon,
instead
of
sentencing
the
petitioners,
the
court,
the
same
judge
presiding,
proceeded
with
the
trial
of
the
farnsworths,
mr.
richard
farnsworth
and
his
son
alan.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
as
his
customary,
your
honor,
after
a
plea
of
nolo
is
entered
it,
then
the
--
the
court
has
an
investigation,
an
independent
investigation,
hears
character
witnesses
and
then
will
enter
sentence
accordingly.
it's
most
unusual
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
the
mere
plea
itself,
confesses
the
facts
such
as
they
are
in
the
indictment.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
that's
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
it
does,
your
honor,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
your
honor.
the
farnsworth
trial
lasted
between
10
and
11
weeks.
since
the
petitioners
were
named
as
conspirators
in
the
indictment,
an
unlimited
amount
of
testimony
was
permitted
by
both
government
counsel
and
the
farnsworth
counsel
against
petitioners
during
this
trial.
since
petitioners
were
not
part
of
this,
for
this
proceeding,
they
had
no
opportunity
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
them.
they
had
no
opportunity
of
cross-examination.
they
had
no
opportunity
to
--
to
present
rebuttal
or
explanatory
testimony.
the
farnsworth
trial
ended
in
the
acquittal
of
alan
farnsworth,
the
son,
and
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree
on
a
verdict
with
respect
to
mr.
farnsworth,
the
dominant
stockholder
in
this
organization.
needless
to
say,
this
was
a
bitter
and
frustrating
defeat
for
the
u.s.
attorney.
and
it
was
in
this
atmosphere
at
the
conclusion
of
the
farnsworth
trial
that
petitioners
were
summoned
before
the
court,
the
same
judge
presiding
for
sentencing.
in
this
atmosphere,
the
petitioners
were
sentenced
to
penitentiary
terms
and
were
each
fined
$20,000.
motions
for
reduction
or
suspension
of
sentence
were
denied.
thereupon,
petitioners
each
filed
a
motion,
denominated
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
again
attacking
the
validity
of
the
indictment.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
your
honor.
the
jury
divided
eight
to
four
in
favor
of
conviction
of
mr.
farnsworth's
father,
the
dominant
stockholder.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
it
was
--
there
was
information
later
that
that
was
the
result.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
that
--
there
has
not
been
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
none.
those
were
the
only
two
that
went
to
trial.
the
petitioners
did
not
participate
in
the
trial.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
the
other
principal
had
been
killed
in
a
hunting
accident.
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
was
denied
by
the
court,
same
judge
presiding,
on
july
13th,
1959.
within
four
days
after
the
denial
of
this
motion,
the
petitioners
each
filed
a
notice
of
appeal
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
some
months
later,
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
first
time,
raised
the
point
of
timeliness
of
the
appeal
and
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
it
had
not
been
timely
presented.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
by
a
divided
court,
dismissed
the
appeal
saying
that
notice
of
appeal
had
not
been
timely
filed.
thereupon,
certiorari
was
sought
from
this
court
and
was
granted.
while
much
likely
said,
concerning
the
fine
reputation
and
character
of
the
petitioners
before
us
today
or
much
might
be
said
about
their
high
standing
in
the
community
and
while
much
might
be
said
about
the
reasons
which
prompted
petitioners
to
enter
their
nolo
contendere
pleas
and
the
disappointments
resulting
therefrom,
it
is
believed
that
these
points
are
not
germane
to
the
issues
before
us
so
i
won't
develop.
the
issues
before
us
are,
one,
whether
the
appeal
was
timely.
two,
whether
the
indictment
was
sufficient,
three,
whether
by
in
affect
trying
petitioners
in
absentia,
the
judgment
was
illegal
and
four,
whether
the
judgment,
the
written
judgment
purported
to
find
the
petitioner's
guilty
of
a
misdemeanor
offense,
filing
false
and
fraudulent
returns
and
conspiring
to
do
so,
but
then
they
imposed
felony
terms
upon.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
i
think
not,
your
honor.
we
applied
for
certiorari
on
all
points
and
the
writ
was
not
limited.
we
have
briefed
all
points
and
we're
prepared
to
argue
all
points.
the
record
is
fully
developed.
it
presents
only
questions
of
law.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
it
would
seem
that
since
it
is
before
this
honorable
court
and
since
it
involves
questions
of
extreme
concern
not
only
to
these
petitioners,
but
to
the
country
as
a
whole
and
see
--
since
these
are
questions
which
undoubtedly
will
come
to
this
court,
this
court
should
pass
upon
them
while
it's
before
it.
i'll
turn
to
the
timeliness
of
the
appeal,
this
essentially
involves
rule
37.
in
taking
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
petitioners
meticulously
followed
rule
37.
the
motion,
denominated
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
was
filed
within
four
days
after
the
judgment.
and
within
four
days
after
the
court
denied
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment,
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed.
in
each
instance,
rule
37
permits
10
days.
permits
10
days
to
file
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
permits
10
days
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
after
a
motion
is
denied.
in
each
instance,
the
time
taken
by
petitioners
was
much
less.
however,
it
is
the
argument
of
the
government
that
under
rule
34,
this
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
was
not
timely.
therefore,
it
was
void
and
was
of
no
effect
under
rule
37.
but
the
answer
to
this
is,
one,
rule
37
merely
states
that
if
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
is
filed
within
10
days
after
the
judgment,
then
after
--
you
have
10
days
after
such
motion
is
overruled
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal.
it
is
not
said
in
rule
37.
the
only
rule
which
purports
to
be
applicable
to
appeals
that
a
motion
of
--
an
arrest
of
judgment
filed
pursuant
to
its
terms,
must
be
timely
under
rule
34,
there's
no
reference
to
rule
34.
nor
does
rule
37
say
that
such
a
notice
or
such
a
motion
of
arrest
of
judgment
must
have
any
other
quality.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
none,
your
honor,
none,
in
this
situation
on
appeal.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
now,
that
--
that's
first
of
my
argument
and
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
the
second
portion
of
my
argument
would
be
this.
that
even
if
rule
34
applies,
even
if
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
described
in
rule
37
must
be
timely
under
rule
34.
the
second
part
of
our
argument
is
that
this
motion
was
timely
under
rule
34.
rule
34
provides
that
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
to
be
timely
under
its
provisions
must
be
filed
within
five
days
after
“determination
of
guilt.”
the
government
would
say
that
when
the
nolo
contendere
plea
was
filed
here,
that
was
a
determination
of
guilt.
and
they
say
the
third,
fifth
and
ninth
circuits
supports
that
view,
but
these
decisions
do
not
support
that
view.
each
of
those
cases
concerned
verdicts
of
guilt.
none
of
them
concern
nolo
contendere
pleas.
the
only
prior
decision,
the
only
prior
decision
that
we
have
been
able
to
find
that
concerned
a
nolo
contendere
plea
is
a
decision
by
this
honorable
court
in
the
sullivan
case.
in
the
sullivan
case,
we
have
facts
very
much
analogous
to
the
facts
of
the
case
before
us
today,
with
a
nolo
contendere
plea
and
then
a
judgment
following
the
judgment,
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
then
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
and
then
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court.
the
facts
were
very
similar
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
this
honorable
court
took
jurisdiction
of
the
sullivan
case.
it
exercised
jurisdiction
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
i
would
not
--
if
--
either
agree
or
disagree,
i
--
i
don't
recall
any
case
that
has
passed
upon
that
point.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
the
nearest
precedent
to
the
point
i
know
of
is
the
sullivan
case
which
involved
the
nolo
contendere
plea
and
it
apparently
did
not
start
the
five-day
period
because
this
court
exercised
jurisdiction
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits.
and
i'm
certain
you
inquired
into
your
jurisdiction
before
it.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
there
was
nothing
said
on
the
subject.
no,
your
honor.
if
it's
overlooked,
then
the
government
says
that
reference
should
be
made
to
rule
34.
they
say
it
is
applicable.
if
this
honorable
court
overlooked
it,
then
this
court
did
the
same
thing
we're
supposed
to
have
done
in
this
case.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
and
that
--
pardon
me,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
i
know
of
nothing
that
there
was
and
to
arraign.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
there
was
no
judgment.
no,
your
honor.
and
we
say
there
should
have
been
no
motion
at
that
time.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
it
is
the
contention
of
the
government
that
rule
34
obviously
applies
here
to
prevent
the
timeliness
of
this
appeal.
however,
this
is
not
so.
it
was
not
obviously
applicable
to
us
and
apparently,
in
the
sullivan
case,
rule
34
was
not
obviously
applicable
to
this
honorable
court.
if
the
government's
contention
is
adopted,
it
would
create
a
track
for
those
who
follow
us
to
fall
into.
their
construction
of
these
rules
is
a
strained
and
torturous
construction.
it
is
contrary
to
the
plain
mandate
of
rule
2
that
the
rules
be
construed
in
a
simple
and
logical
manner
to
promote
justice.
further,
if
the
appeal
in
this
case
is
not
timely
under
rule
34
and
rule
37,
then
we
submit
that
it
was
timely
under
rule
12
(b),
which
permits
a
court
to
notice
the
invalidity
of
an
indictment
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding.
and
also,
timely,
under
section
2255
of
the
judicial
code
which
permits
a
court
to
vacate
any
judgment
where
the
indictment
is
insufficient.
i
turn
now
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment.
this
is
an
extremely
important
problem.
it
is
grey
--
a
grave
problem
not
only
for
these
petitioners
but
for
the
country
as
a
whole.
last
year
alone,
15,000
tax
evasion
cases
either
actual
or
threatened
were
handled
by
the
treasury
department
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
this
number
will
increase
as
time
goes
on.
all
it
takes
to
make
a
tax
evasion
or
a
fraud
cage
is
a
determination
by
the
revenue
service
that
a
tax
deficiency
exists
and
that
such
deficiency
was
due
to
willfulness.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
say
that,
sir
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
well,
i
think
sir
that
the
law
is
being
rigorously
enforced
now
and
will
continue
to
be
but
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
there
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
it
is
a
deterrent
effect
but
there
are
many
millions
more
taxpayers
to
be
considered
and
thousands
more
of
revenue
agents.
i
think
that
alone
will
cause
the
increase.
we
hired
2000
more
revenue
agents
just
the
other
day.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
well
that
--
that's
the
problem
(voice
overlap).
an
agent
determines
the
deficiency,
says,
it's
due
to
willfulness
and
then
we
have
a
tax
evasion
case.
at
that
point,
records
and
information
are
withheld
from
the
taxpayers
as
was
done
here.
when
it
was
determined
that
this
was
a
potential
tax
evasion
case,
the
corporate
records
were
seized,
virtually,
all
the
corporate
records
were
taken
to
the
courthouse.
and
when
we
sought
a
bill
of
particulars,
the
assistant
us
attorney
in
charge
of
this
proceeding
referring
to
the
literally
thousands
of
papers
in
this
room,
said,
“here's
your
bill
of
particulars.
our
case
will
be
made
from
these
documents.”
for
this
reason,
it
is
essential.
your
honors,
it
is
essential
that
this
court
lay
down
reasonable
rules
for
the
conduct
of
these
proceedings.
since
there
will
be
so
many
indictments,
the
rules
must
be
made
clear.
coming
to
the
heart
of
the
government's
argument
on
the
indictment,
the
government
contends
that
an
indictment
in
the
mere
wording
of
the
statute
is
adequate.
however,
this
statute
merely
provides
that
any
person
who
knowingly
attempts
to
evade
or
decrees
any
tax
is
guilty
of
a
felony.
that's
all
the
statute
says.
it's
about
as
vague
as
a
statute
can
be.
however,
a
number
of
lower
courts
have
upheld
indictments
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
this
is
on
the
theory
that
when
an
individual
is
indicted
for
evading
his
own
tax,
that
individual
is
presumed
to
have
a
greater
knowledge
of
his
affairs
than
anybody
else.
he
has
presumed
or
known
what
he
did
wrong
and
can
conduct
his
defense
accordingly.
that
observation
could
not
be
applicable
here.
here,
we
have
a
huge
corporation
and
we
have
employees
of
that
huge
corporation
accused
of
aiding
the
corporation
to
evade
its
tax.
two
of
these
petitioners
were
job
superintendents,
they
were
outside
men.
i
doubt
if
they
ever
saw
the
books
and
records
or
the
tax
returns
of
this
company
and
if
they
had
seen
them,
they
wouldn't
understand
what
they
meant.
it
would
be
a
mystery
to
them.
therefore,
when
an
indictment
in
the
mere
language
of
the
statute
is
returned
against
these
men,
it
is
meaningless
to
them.
the
sixth
amendment
of
the
constitution
provides
that
an
accused
shall
be
informed
of
the
cause
and
nature
of
the
charge
against
him.
this
was
not
done
here.
when
measured
by
the
sixth
amendment,
this
indictment
was
absolutely
insufficient.
these
men
do
not
know
with
what
they
were
charged.
they
didn't
know
then
and
they
still
don't
know.
in
addition
to
the
vagueness
and
insufficiency
of
this
indictment,
two
essentials
elements
of
the
purported
crime
were
missing.
the
indictment
did
not
allege
that
there
was
a
tax
deficiency
in
the
income
taxes
of
the
farnsworth
&
chambers
company
for
the
years
in
question,
nor
did
the
indictment
allege
that
the
individuals
had
knowledge
of
any
such
tax
deficiency.
the
indictment
did
not
say
that
all
of
the
taxes,
owed
by
this
corporation
were
not
paid
when
such
taxes
were
due.
indeed,
the
indictment
did
not
even
say
that
there
was
an
underpayment
of
taxes
during
the
years
in
question.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
the
first
four
counts,
sir.
all
it
says
is
that
a
return
was
filed
showing
income
of
so
much
and
taxes
so
much,
whereas
a
return
should've
been
filed
showing
tax
of
--
or
income
of
a
greater
amount
and
a
tax
of
a
greater
amount.
there's
no
reference
anywhere
in
there
to
the
amount
of
payment
or
the
amount
of
any
payment,
underpayment
that
may
have
existed.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
the
--
the
indictment
was
challenged
immediately
when
the
--
after
the
indictment
was
returned
on
the
grounds
of
insufficiency
and
that
it
was
utterly
void
and
meaningless.
then
again
after
judgment,
the
indictment
was
again
challenged
and
it's
been
challenged
at
each
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
what
page,
your
--
your
honor?
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
i
believe
if
the
indict
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
if
the
indictment
is
studied
closely,
i
think
it
will
say
that
they
--
a
return
was
filed
showing
a
tax
of
so
much
and
the
government
says
that
a
tax
should've
been
–
that
a
return
should've
been
filed
showing
a
greater
amount
of
tax
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
--
which
they
well
knew.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
it
says
whereas
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
--
because
they
then
and
there
well
knew
the
net
income
of
the
corporation
for
the
said
calendar
year
was
a
sum
of
$763,000
and
a
total
tax
of
$482,000.
it
is
not
enough,
sir
because
it
nowhere
states
that
they
didn't
pay
that
amount
or
that
there
was
an
underpayment
or
that
an
amended
return
was
not
filed
showing
that
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
well,
i
think
the
rules
require
a
statement
that
there
was
a
tax
deficiency
for
the
year
and
that
the
tax
had
not
been
paid,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
as
i
understand
it,
an
indictment
must
be
a
direct,
an
unequivocal
charge
of
the
essential
elements
to
the
offense
and
this
–
at
most
it
could
only
be
by
inference
that
the
tax
had
not
been
paid.
i
think
when
this
is
read
and
reread
you
cannot
reach
any
other
conclusion,
but
the
one
which
i
have
submitted.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
your
honor,
the
bill
in
particulars
will
not
help
a
(inaudible)
indictment
in
any
form.
if
the
indictment
is
insufficient,
then
it
cannot
be
cured
by
any
subsequent
paper.
only
the
grand
jury
can
return
the
indictment
to
be
sufficient.
i
see
that
my
time
is
nearly
gone.
i
have
other
vile
items
i
think
in
this
petition.
if
i
--
time
cannot
be
extended,
i
can't
do
anything
but
i'll
be
content
to
rest
on
our
briefs.
i
would
like
to
save
just
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
i
think
the
very
complexity
of
the
government's
argument
conclusively
demonstrates
that
their
position
violates
rule
2,
that
these
rules
should
be
simple
of
application
for
the
interest
of
justice.
the
rule
37,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
think
is
exactly
as
you
say,
yet
on
its
face
says
that
if
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
be
filed
within
10
days
after
judgment,
then
that
prolongs
the
time
for
appeal.
there
is
no
reference
in
there
to
rule
34
nor
is
there
any
requirement
there
that
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
have
any
other
quality.
and
that's
the
only
rule,
when
you
read
the
rules,
that's
the
only
one
applicable
here
that's
over
under
the
section
denominated
appeal.
rule
34
is
not
there.
it
was
only
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes
sir
and
the
three
cases
mentioned,
the
third,
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
as
i
recall
all
involved
verdicts
of
guilty.
i
don't
recall
a
case
involving
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
you
--
you
would
be
(inaudible)
hardly
to
do
that,
i
agree
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
the
judge
would
withdraw
it
for
you
if
--
i
feel
sure,
if
you
filed
he
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
within
five
days.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir,
before
he's
entered
judgment.
now,
there's
one
other
very
important
point
here
too.
in
the
--
under
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
we
think
judgment
here
was
not
addressed
to
the
nolo
contendere
plea,
but
was
based
upon
what
this
judge
heard
during
the
ten-week
trial
of
the
farnsworth
case.
we
think
it
was
the
evidence
adduced
there
that
was
the
basis
for
this
judgment.
therefore,
even
if
the
nolo
contendere
plea
be
considered
a
determination
of
guilt,
which
we
don't
see
how
it
could
be.
we
think
guilt
here
was
determined
from
the
facts
heard
in
this
case
where
we
had
no
opportunity
of
cross
examination
or
to
put
on
rebuttal
testimony.
so
we
would
feel
here
that
judgment
was
a
determination
of
guilt.
even
if
under
other
circumstances,
a
nolo
contendere
plea
might
be
so
considered.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes
sir
and
contrary
to
the
tucker
case
and
the
norris
case,
he
did
so.
under
those
decisions
when
a
judge
does
that
then
he
loses
jurisdiction
to
impose
sentence
under
the
nolo
contendere
plea
and
that's
one
of
the
points
in
our
brief
that
here
since
we
were
in
effect
tried
in
absentia
by
facts
heard
during
this
trial,
then
the
judgment
itself
is
illegal
and
cannot
stand.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
there,
you're
represented
or
on
the
pre-sentence
report,
you
don't
have
advocates
presenting
an
unlimited
amount
of
testimony
against
you
with
no
opportunity
to
rebut
it.
you
have
an
impartial
investigator
who
was
investigating
facts.
here
both
the
farnsworth
counsel
and
government
counsel
were
trying
to
layoff
as
much
of
this
case
as
possible
on
our
petitioners
in
order
to
divert
the
case
from
the
fransworths.
it
was
not
an
impartial
proceeding
such
as
the
sentence
investigation,
wouldn't
it?
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
we
have
gone
into
that
and
that
was
a
historical
function
of
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
it
was
not
until
rule
37
and
its
predecessor
that
it
had
a
function
of
coming
in
after
judgment.
i
think
in
our
brief,
we
have
developed
the
historical
sequence
of
the
rule
and
show
that
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
is
now
used
in
practice
is
not
applied
in
the
same
manner
as
it
had
been
historically.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
there
are
no
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
there
are
no
official
minutes
showing
why
this
was
done,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes
sir
there
are
none
here.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
the
--
the
rules
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
i
can
--
i
contacted
as
many
members
of
the
committee
as
i
could
find
who
were
living
--
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
--
and
--
and
they
have
--
no,
no.
they
have
no
--
no
(inaudible)
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes
sir.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
yes,
sir.
i
--
i
recall
nothing
in
there.
however,
and
they're
very
clearly
permit
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
after
a
judge.
mr.
c.
w.
wellen
i
think
we
have
traced
the
historical
development
in
our
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
