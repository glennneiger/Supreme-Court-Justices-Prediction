the
bill
of
particulars,
it
doesn't
particularize,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
after
the
court
has
sentenced
him
on
the
plea
of
nolo?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
the
government
(inaudible)
in
the
plea
of
nolo?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
i
did
not
confess.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
understand
--
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
fifth
circuit
held
the
appeal
was
not
timely
and
did
not
go
further
or
reach
the
merits?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
if
they
are
wrong
about
that,
then
wouldn't
that
end
our
inquiry
here?
can
we
just
send
it
back
to
them
and
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
but
if
they
fail
to
hear
an
appeal,
they
should've
heard.
should
they
not
now
hear
that
appeal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
what
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
on
march
7
(inaudible)
and
the
pleas
of
the
nolo
or
(inaudible)
was
there
any
who
have
left?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
terris,
do
i
have
the
table
correctly
in
mind?
i
gather
from
mr.
wellen's
argument
that
the
judgment
was
entered,
the
determination
of
guilt
or
judgment
was
presented
on
june
22
--
on
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
next
day,
june
23,
motion
in
arrest
was
filed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
july
13,
the
motion
in
arrest
was
denied.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
july
15
and
17
respectively,
notices
of
appeal
were
lost.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
why
didn't
that
properly
perfect
the
appeal
timely?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
were
they
out
of
time?
they
were
filed
the
next
day
after
the
entry
of
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
was
the
determination
of
guilt?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
be
more
of
a
determination
than
the
returning
of
the
verdict
by
a
jury
of
guilty?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright,
then
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
judgment
on
the
verdict
before
there's
a
determination?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
think
that's
implying
on
it
here.
the
practice
on
what's
right
upon
what
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
arrest?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was
the
attack
made
on
the
completion
that
that
was
heard
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
the
day
after
it?
or
i
would
think
that
the
determination
of
guilty
renew
the
past
guarantee
of
the
judgment(inaudible)
of
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
nolo
and
that
version
was
the
arrest
that's
not
done
(inaudible)
is
your
contention
as
to
acceptance
of
the
plea
of
nolo
was
“a
determination
of
guilt.”

justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
terris,
suppose
that
these
two
rules,
37
and
34,
are
not
reconciled
then
would
it
not
be
true
that
in
the
interest
of
allowing
an
appeal,
the
ambiguity
ought
to
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
appellant?
justice
charles

case
was
not
