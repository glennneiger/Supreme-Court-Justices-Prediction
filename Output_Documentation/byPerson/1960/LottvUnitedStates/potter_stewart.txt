justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
mean
a
token
bill
of
particulars?
that's
a
new
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
anything
in
the
suit
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
just
your
characterization
in
developing
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
just
so
i
don't
understand
the
facts.
i
--
i
--
one
of
the
farnsworths
was
acquitted
and
as
to
the
other,
there
was
a
hung
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
get
a
public
result
in
the
jury
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
--
was
there
a
retrial
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
can
under
the
rules,
clearly
be
made
within
10
days
after
the
judgment,
can
they,
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
justice
potter
stewart
then
what
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
i'm
perhaps
being
a
little
obtuse
and
maybe
i'm
asking
you
to
repeat
but
what
do
you
say
that
that
part
of
rule
7
--
37
which
subsumes
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
in
the
10-day
period
after
judgment.
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
made
when?
justice
potter
stewart
but
possibly
after
judgment,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
now
could
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
three?
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
happen.
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
then
--
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
what
--
how
much
time
does
he
have
to
file
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
after,
five.
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
absolutely.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
now,
what's
number
two?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
assuming
--
we're
assuming
now
that
you're
correct
that
a
nolo
plea
and
a
guilty
plea
and
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
guilty
verdict
are
all
the
same
equivalence.
justice
potter
stewart
i'll
assume
that
for
now.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
would
on
it
--
on
its
face,
rule
37
would
seem
to
imply
that
a
person
after
judgment
has
10
days
within
which
to
file
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
would
--
you
would
concede
on
its
face
superficially
looking
at
it
and
there
would
seem
to
be
that
implication
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
after
determination
of
guilt.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
may
suggest
the
determination
of
guilt
doesn't
mean
that
you
tell
us.
that's
just
a
possibility
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fact
--
the
fact
is
mr.
wellen
that
this
is
a
very
peculiar
case.
it's
a
white
crow,
isn't
it,
because
normally,
what
these
rules
are
addressed
to
is
a
--
is
a
trial
and
a
--
and
a
verdict
of
guilty
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
either
by
a
judge
without
a
jury
or
by
a
jury
and
then
generally
within
five
days
thereafter,
the
defendant's
counsel
files
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
that's
a
normal
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
generally,
when
you
have
a
plea
of
guilty
or
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere,
you're
not
going
to
turn
around
and
file
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
because
you
--
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
made
a
--
you
made
a
decision
on
behalf
of
your
client
to
--
to
make
that
plea.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
you
change
your
mind,
you're
going
to
make
a
motion
to
change
the
plea,
rather
withdraw
the
plea.
