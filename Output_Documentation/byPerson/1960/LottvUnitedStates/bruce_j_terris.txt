mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
reply
initially
to
a
couple
of
statements
which
were
made
by
petitioners'
counsel
even
though
they
really
don't
go
to
the
legal
merits
of
the
case.
first,
the
government
doesn't
intend
to
retry
mr.
farnsworth
sr.
but
that
the
retrial
date
has
been
delayed
by
the
district
court
until
the
disposition
of
this
case.
and
secondly,
the
reason
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
if
--
if
this
court
agrees
with
petitioners
that
the
indictment
was
invalid,
then
--
then
i
take
it
the
district
court
does
not
want
to
go
through
another
lengthy
trial.
the
first
trial
was
about
twos
month
trial
and
--
and
i
--
i
assume,
although
i
don't
know
that
that
is
--
that
he
doesn't
want
to
duplicate
that
for
a
way
--
what
may
turn
out
to
be
no
reason.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
only
substantial
issue
which
is
before
the
court
is
the
jurisdictional
issue.
we
think
that
if
we
are
wrong
in
the
jurisdictional
issue
that
petitioners'
other
contentions
are
so
entirely
frivolous
on
their
face
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
below.
if
they
--
this
court
finds
that
these
issues
are
of
greater
difficulty,
we
think
then
of
course
the
case
should
be
sent
back
as
the
normal
practice
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
its
determination.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that
--
that's
the
written
judgment.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
that's
entirely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
our
contention
is
based
--
it
has
two
halves,
both
of
which
petitioners
contest.
first
of
all,
we
claim
that
the
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
were
totally
invalid
that
--
since
they
were
out
of
time,
that
the
district
court
did
not
even
have
power
to
consider
those
motions
under
the
holdings
of
this
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
rule
34
which
is
the
governing
rule
states
the
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
must
be
made
within
five
days
after
determination
of
guilt.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
determination
of
guilt,
your
honor,
in
our
view
and
we
think
this
is
clearly
sustained
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
at
the
time
the
petitioners
pleaded
nolo
contendere
and
that
the
district
court
explicitly
accepted
these
pleas.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
would
not
be
more
if
it
would
be
the
same
in
our
view.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
not
if
--
no,
your
honor.
determination
of
guilt
is
at
the
time
of
verdict.
the
courts
of
appeals
which
have
dealt
with
this
issue,
the
meaning
of
rule
34,
and
they
have
not
dealt
with
it
in
the
terms
of
a
--
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere.
they
dealt
with
it
in
--
after
a
judgment
by
a
jury
or
after
a
plea
of
guilty.
in
those
instances,
they
--
they
have
clearly
stated
that
the
time
under
rule
34
runs
from
the
determination
of
guilt
as
the
--
as
the
verdict
or
as
the
plea
of
guilty.
they
interpret
that
to
be
the
meaning
of
rule
34
and
there's
no
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
--
any
court
which
has
held
to
the
contrary.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
you
arrest
the
judgment
which
is
yet
to
be
entered.
that
is
historically
--
historically
what
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
is.
in
fact,
this
is
so
much
so
that
in
--
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
now
we're
talking
about
a
--
a
nolo
plea.
yes,
it's
within
his
discretion
just
as
if
it
would
be
within
his
discretion
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
because
as
i
say,
historically,
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
have
been
motions
to
arrest
the
judgment
that's
--
which
is
yet
to
be
entered.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
that
--
that
is
correct.
it's
not
historically
been
to
set
aside
a
judgment.
now,
the
rules
--
obviously,
rule
34
does
not
--
does
not
confine
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
just
before
judgment.
there
maybe
times
when
the
time
--
five-day
period
runs
until
after
judgment.
but
the
main
purpose
of
rules
in
arrest
of
motion,
there
--
the
arrest
of
judgment,
the
usual
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
will
be
before
judgment.
as
i
--
as
petitioners'
counsel
has
indicated,
his
--
his
jurisdictional
contentions
have
--
have
two
--
really
two
separate
bases.
first
of
all,
he
claims
that
his
notices
of
appeal
were
timely
filed.
and
second
of
all,
he
claims
that
even
if
they
weren't
timely
filed,
that
his
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
should
be
considered
as
if
they
were
motions,
either
under
rule
12
(b)
or
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2255.
and
that
their
appeals
which
were
in
fact
taken
from
the
judgments
in
the
criminal
case
should
be
treated
as
if
they
were
taken
from
the
denial
of
the
motions
either
under
rule
12
(b)
or
section
2255.
now,
rule
37
provides
two
separate
periods
for
filing
notices
of
appeal.
first
of
all,
it
states
that
“the
notices
of
appeal
maybe
filed
within
10
days
of
judgment.”
concededly,
petitioners
did
not
file
their
notices
of
appeal
within
10
days
of
judgment,
but
rule
37
alternatively
states
that
notices
of
appeal
maybe
filed
within
10
days
of
denial
of
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
or
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
when
such
a
motion
has
been
made
within
10
days
of
judgment
and
petitioners
claim
that
they
come
within
this
tolling
provision.
petitioners
say
and
that
this
is
conceded
that
they
filed
their
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
within
10
days
of
judgment
and
within
10
days
of
the
denial
of
their
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment,
they
filed
their
notices
of
appeal.
therefore,
they
say
that
their
notices
of
appeal
were
timely
filed
whether
or
not
their
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
were
timely
filed.
and
then
in
addition,
they
claim
that
their
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
were
timely
filed
within
the
meaning
of
rule
34.
that
is
within
five
days
after
determination
of
guilt.
now,
we
--
we
disagree
with
both
halves
of
this
--
of
petitioners'
contention.
we
believe
that
petitioners'
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
were
not
timely
that
they
were
not
within
five
days
after
determination
of
guilt.
the
determination
of
guilt
in
this
case
occurred
on
march
17
and
20th,
1959
for
it
was
on
those
dates
that
the
district
court
accepted
petitioners'
pleas
of
nolo
and
the
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
were
not
filed
until
over
three
months
later.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
but
we
--
we
--
but
our
difference
with
petitioners
is
what
the
five
days
runs
--
runs
from.
there's
no
doubt
that
it
was
within
five
days
that
it
runs
from
judgment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
judgment
--
the
written
judgment
was
on
the
22nd
of
june
and
the
oral
sentence
was
on
the
19th
of
june
but
that
--
that
distinction
doesn't
matter
because
--
in
any
case
it
was
within
five
days
if
that
was
the
--
if
the
judgment
is
the
crucial
date
for
rule
34.
now,
we
rest
our
contention
in
this
matter,
largely
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
hudson
and
norris
cases.
the
hudson
case
in
272
u.s.
and
the
norris
case
in
281
u.s.
in
those
cases,
this
court
held
that
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere
is
as
conclusive
in
the
particular
case
before
the
court
as
a
plea
of
guilty.
in
the
norris
case,
this
court
said
that
after
a
plea
of
nolo
contendere,
the
court
is
no
longer
concerned
with
the
question
of
guilt
but
only
with
the
character
and
extent
of
the
punishment.
we
think
this
is
as
clear
as
--
as
anything
can
be
that
determination
of
guilt
is
at
the
time
of
the
plea
and
its
acceptance.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes
--
yes,
the
sentence
i
just
--
leaving
the
--
yes,
that's
right,
your
honor
leaving
the
--
the
punishment
yet
to
be
imposed.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
we
have
--
we
agree
entirely,
your
honor.
there
is
something
left
to
be
done.
the
punishment
is
left
to
be
done.
and
in
fact,
the
rules
of
--
of
this
--
the
criminal
rules
in
rule
32
state
that
--
that
a
judgment
shall
include
and
then
the
--
the
plea,
the
verdict
or
findings
which
we
say
is
the
determination
of
guilt
that
is
conviction
and
--
and
the
sentence.
but
we
think
there's
a
very
definite
distinction
in
the
rules
and
in
the
norris
case
too
between
judgment
and
when
guilt
has
been
determined.
and
in
fact,
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
then
--
then
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
there's
a
--
there's
an
additional
question
which
is
if
that
--
if
the
motions
are
in
timely,
whether
that
means
that
are
so
void
that
the
10-day
tolling
provision
of
rule
37
does
not
run
from
their
denial
but
runs
in
fact
in
the
--
from
the
judgment.
in
fact,
the
holding
in
the
norris
case
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
conclusiveness
of
a
plea
of
nolo
is
made
even
more
clear
by
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
a
stipulation
was
entered
by
both
parties
that
--
as
to
facts
which
would
go
only
to
sentencing.
and
this
stipulation
showed
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
not
guilty
of
defense
which
he
had
pleaded
nolo.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
--
that's
a
--
i
--
i
--
my
argument
here
is
only
to
equate
the
two.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
there
are
only
two
court
of
appeals
cases,
your
honor,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
and
they
say
the
formal
plea
of
guilty
that
is
the
determination
of
guilt
for
the
running
of
the
five-day
provision
in
rule
34.
that's
right,
there
--
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
contrary
authority.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that's
right.
but
i
can't
get
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
oh,
no,
no
--
no,
your
honor.
i've
--
i‘ve
misled
you.
they
--
the
time
for
appeal
still
runs
from
sentence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
well,
the
five
days.
the
10
days
is
the
--
is
what
runs
from
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
from
sentence.
the
five
days
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right
and
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule
was
that
to
require
the
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
motions
for
a
new
trial
be
promptly
filed
so
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
as
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
--
that's
precise
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
precisely,
your
honors
and
particularly
because
both
motions
for
a
new
trial
and
in
arrest
of
judgment
did
not
attack
the
sentence.
they
attacked
--
they
attacked
the
conviction.
they
attacked
things
that
have
already
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
determination
of
guilt.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
not
sure,
i
understand
your
honor.
they
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
that
--
well,
they
have
an
additional
--
convey
of
a
number
of
additional
contentions,
but
if
we're
wrong
in
that
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
that
--
that
our
argument
is
that
the
two
were
the
same
and
that
certainly,
a
plea
of
guilty
just
as
much
as
a
jury
verdict
is
a
determination
of
guilt.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
will.
he
--
petitioners
do
have
other
arguments.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
norris
and
hudson
case
made
clear
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
plea
to
the
indictment
for
the
purposes
of
this
case.
now,
various
decisions
and
petitioners
in
their
brief
have
--
have
exerted
the
crucial
language
in
--
in
seriatum
that
--
at
one
point
in
their
brief.
they've
--
it's
--
it's
referred
to
in
different
ways
by
--
by
court.
sometimes
they
say
they're
just
throwing
themselves
at
the
mercy
of
the
court.
sometimes
they
say
they're
pleading
guilty
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
but
in
any
event,
for
the
particular
case,
the
person
is
considered
is
guilty
at
that
point,
as
soon
as
it's
accepted
by
the
court
and
that's
under
the
decisions
of
--
of
the
norris
and
the
hudson
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
i've
--
i
--
the
best
place
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
well
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
--
i
--
the
best
reference
i
think
is
in
the
article
by
orfield
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
on
arrest
of
judgment
in
the
federal
--
in
federal
criminal
procedure
and
he
deals
with
british
practice
and
--
and
what
has
been
traditional
in
this
country.
in
fact,
he
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
he
wonders
even
under
the
--
under
the
federal
rules
whether
there's
power
to
--
whether
you
can
make
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
after
judgment
even
if
they're
within
the
literal
terms
of
--
of
the
rules.
i
don't
--
i
don't
suggest
that
history
should
be
--
should
countermand
what
seems
to
me
the
clear
mandate
of
the
rules.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
we
thought
that
the
--
that
the
norris
and
hudson
cases
since
they
virtually
talk
in
terms
of
determination
of
guilt
would
be
conclusive
that
i
think
we
should
have
dealt
down
with
the
history
of
--
of
these
motions
as
well.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
after
determination
of
guilt
but
we
don't
think
in
the
normal
case,
they
contemplate
being
filed
after
judgment.
normally,
judgment
is
separated
from
determination
of
guilt
by
more
than
five
days.
now,
there
are
instances
when
that
is
not
true,
although
i
take
it,
the
better
practice
is
to
make
that
kind
of
separation,
so
that
there's
time
for
a
pre-sentence
report.
but
normally,
there
will
be
a
separation
and
normally
then,
motions
for
a
new
trial
and
in
arrest
of
judgment
will
be
considered
prior
to
the
sentence.
they
will
be
gotten
to
--
out
of
the
way
before
the
sentence.
i
might
say
that
this
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
--
no,
your
honors.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
that's
the
second
half.
that
--
that
is
the
second
half
of
--
of
petitioners'
contention.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
--
that's
our
view.
they
claim
that
even
if
the
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
are
untimely
and
if
they're
untimely,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
district
court
has
no
power
to
even
consider
them.
this
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
rule
37,
as
petitioners
themselves
emphasize,
is
a
rule
for
--
for
filing
notices
of
appeal.
it
is
not
a
rule
which
--
which
determines
when
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
maybe
filed.
that
rule
--
that
--
that
time
period
is
in
rule
34.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
five
days
of
determination
of
guilt.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
now,
we're
back
to
the
first
half
of
the
petitioners
[attempt
to
laughter]
--
i
was
--
i'm
--
at
this
point,
i
am
assuming
that
the
--
that
the
government
is
correct
that
determination
of
guilt
in
this
case
was
that
at
the
time
of
plea
of
nolo
contendere,
at
the
time
it
was
accepted.
now
petitioners
go
beyond
that
and
they
rely
on
this
wording
in
rule
37.
and
they
say
even
if
it
was
out
of
time
under
rule
34,
even
so,
that
the
tolling
provision
of
rule
37
means
that
they
have
10
days
from
the
denial
of
these
motions.
now
we
say
that
this
makes
a
--
a
perfectly
ridiculous
situation.
it
means
--
first
of
all,
the
district
court
can't
consider
these
motions.
in
fact,
in
the
reply
brief,
petitioners
say
that
the
only
purpose
of
rule
37
is
for
purposes
of
appeal.
it
doesn't
mean
--
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
go
even
to
the
question
of
what
the
district
court
can
consider.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
within
five
days
thereafter,
in
five
days
thereafter.
the
safe
--
and
we
think
that
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
rule
34
is
--
means
the
same
as
rule
33,
although
the
wording
is
slightly
different.
in
rule
33,
the
wording
is
verdict
for
a
finding
of
guilty.
here
it's
determination
of
guilt,
but
we
think
there's
no
--
there's
no
difference
between
that
so
as
to
both
rule
of
33
and
34,
there
is
a
five-day
time
limit.
then
he
has
10
days
--
if
that's
denied
before
sentence,
he
has
10
days
after
judgment
in
which
to
appeal.
if
it
is
not
denied
before
judgment
then
he
has
10
days
from
whenever
it
is
denied.
but
we
--
and
this
is
of
course
the
majority
--
the
holding
of
the
majority
courts
of
appeals.
it's
the
holding
of
the
third,
fifth
and
ninth
circuits.
the
tenth
circuit
is
the
only
circuit
which
agrees
with
petitioners.
and
even
that
circuit
indicates
that
petitioners'
argue
--
they'd
say
that
the
government
--
the
tenth
circuit
says
in
holding
in
amount
--
what
amounts
the
petitioners'
argument
that
the
government's
view
tends
to
harmonize
the
two
rules,
they
are
33
and
37.
and
the
petitioners'
argument
creates
an
anomalous
situation.
well,
of
course
it
does
because
it
means
that
rule
34,
the
time
limit
and
it
is
virtually
read
of
the
rules.
it
means
that
instead
of
five
days
after
arrest
of
--
after
determination
of
guilt,
it
means
that
in
addition,
you
get
10
days
after
judgment.
there
could
be
no
possible
usefulness
remaining
for
rule
34
except
for
the
--
you
don't
get
a
tolling,
you
don't
get
--
you
may
not
get
a
tolling
with
the
same
tolling
effect,
but
there
--
in
--
in
our
view,
the
--
what
--
what
petitioners
are
in
--
in
essence
arguing
is
that
rule
of
37
supersedes
rule
34.
there's
nothing
left
of
rule
34
except
for
--
i
take
it,
you
can't
make
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
from
the
time
that
the
five
days
have
elapsed
to
judgment.
that
time
you
can't
make
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
you
can
make
it
before
and
you
can
make
that
after.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
means
that
the
--
that
they
--
that
their
valid
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
within
the
--
within
the
provision
of
rule
34.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
they
could
be
--
that's
right.
that's
what
--
that
the
on
--
there
are
three
situations
we
think
where
the
tolling
provision
operates.
and
this
is
how
we
harmonize
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
two
rules.
there
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now,
the
first
situation,
this
is
the
one
we
think
will
be
most
likely
and
that
is
if
sentence
and
judgment
come
at
this
--
the
sentencing
conviction
come
at
the
same
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
now,
that
doesn't
--
that
is
probably
not
the
best
practice
but
it
does
occur.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
--
or
at
least
--
or
at
least
sentence
comes
within
the
five-day
period
for
filing
motions.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
the
first
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
has
five
days.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
after
the
time
he
pleas
nolo.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
the
same
day
than
it's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it
makes
no
difference
of
what
you
say
to.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
and
accept
it.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
that
is
--
that's
the
major
one.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
--
the
second
one
is
if
the
district
court
withholds
decision
on
a
plea
on
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
which
is
timely
filed
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
precisely.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
now,
if
a
--
if
a
defendant
makes
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
within
five
days
of
his
nolo
plea
and
then
the
district
court
withholds
decision
on
it
until
after
sentence
then
again,
the
10-day
period
runs
from
the
--
from
the
time
the
decision
on
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
third
--
the
third
possibility
is
if
a
district
court
grants
an
application
which
is
timely
made
within
the
five-day
period
of
rule
33
or
34
to
extend
the
time
for
filing
motions
under
33
or
34,
then
sentence
is
imposed
before
the
extended
period
is
elapsed
and
then
the
motions
are
made
within
the
10
days
of
judgment.
now
that
presumably
wouldn't
have
to
carry
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
but
on
the
other
hand,
rule
34
on
its
face
indicates
you
have
five
days
from
determination
of
guilt.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
so
you
got
to
harmonize
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
there's
no
way
to
look
at
one
alone.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
no
--
no
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
court
of
appeals
though
has
--
has
decided
the
determination
of
guilt
means
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
that
will
--
that
but
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
other
phase
of
the
argument,
there
are
three
circuits
which
agree
with
the
government's
position
and
the
tenth
circuit
agrees
with
petitioners'
position.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
who
--
john,
yes,
and
smith
they're
both
--
and
smith
--
smith
admits
that
--
that
the
--
the
holding
of
the
tenth
circuit
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
third,
fifth
and
ninth.
the
smith
case
of
the
tenth
circuit
indicates
that
its
view
although
it
--
it
believes
it's
--
it's
required
by
the
literal
language
of
rule
37
completely
fails
to
harmonize
rules
34
and
37.
in
the
little
time
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
turn
briefly
to
petitioners'
alternative
argument
that
if
his
direct
appeals
weren't
timely,
that
his
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
should
be
considered
as
if
they
were
motions
under
rule
12
(b)
or
under
section
2255.
and
that
their
appeal
should
be
considered
as
if
they
were
taken
from
the
denial
of
these
motions.
the
petitioners'
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
which
were
filed
by
able
counsel
were
--
were
denominated,
were
named
to
be
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
and
the
district
court
denied
them
on
this
basis.
petitioners
can't
now
ask
to
the
court
of
appeals,
initially
in
this
court
to
then
search
out
other
--
any
other
remedy
which
maybe
--
maybe
possible
and
to
reverse
the
district
court
on
a
ground
which
the
district
court
didn't
even
have
before
it.
and
then
petitioners
own
notices
of
appeal
were
not
--
did
not
specify
the
appeal
was
to
be
taken
from
the
denial
of
their
motions,
rather
it
was
from
the
--
it
was
from
the
judgment
in
the
criminal
case.
and
beyond
this,
even
if
petitioners
were
correct,
the
only
grounds
which
would
be
retained
in
the
case
were
those
which
were
in
the
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
and
the
only
--
the
only
one
of
the
three
substantive
contentions
which
was
included
in
their
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
were
those
which
attacked
the
indictment.
the
other
two
grounds
were
not
included.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
we
--
we
think
it
would
be,
your
honor
if
it
--
if
it
comes
following
--
following
the
judgment
in
the
--
in
the
main
case.
but
--
see,
their
--
their
argument
is
it
isn't
part
of
the
main
case
at
all.
that
the
district
court
and
this
court
should
consider
it
as
if
it
were
--
if
its
out
of
time,
then
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
at
least
their
section
2255
argument
that
its
just
like
another
motion
to
vacate
and
their
rule
12
(b)
claim
i
take
it
is
that
you
can
make
it
anytime
during
the
proceeding.
now,
the
short
answer
to
their
section
2255
argument
is
that
there
weren't
in
custody,
either
--
either
then
when
they
made
their
motions
or
are
their
in
custody
today.
now
they
argue
that
some
sort
of
constructive
custodies
involved
since
that
their
direct
appeals
were
untimely,
then
they
should've
been
--
been
bail
was
improper
and
therefore,
they
should've
been
in
jail
but
it
seems
clear
that
the
heflin
case
holds
that
2255
is
available
only
when
a
person
is
in
custody
and
is
entitled
to
be
released
from
custody.
and
as
to
rule
12
(b),
we
think
that
the
history
of
that
rule
shows
that
the
phrase
“at
anytime
during
dependency
of
the
proceeding”
does
not
include
the
period
after
determination
of
guilt.”
for
that
rule
was
promulgated
under
the
act
of
june
29th,
1940
which
provides
only
for
the
promulgation
of
rules
with
respect
to
proceedings
before
verdict,
plea
of
guilty
or
finding
of
guilty.
and
rule
34
on
the
other
hand
was
promulgated
under
the
earlier
criminal
appeals
rules
act
of
1933
which
provides
for
rules
after
verdict,
plea
of
guilty
or
finding
of
guilty.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
first
of
all,
we
think
they're
very
easily
reconciled
but
the
government's
position
under
--
in
both
the
view
with
the
tenth
circuit
which
agrees
with
petitioners
and
in
a
view
with
the
three
circuits
with
--
which
agreed
but
the
government
all
think
that
the
government's
view
reconciles
the
two
rules.
but
beyond
that,
we
think
that
the
robinson
case
made
clear
that
there
isn't
a
--
that
this
was
not
an
area
in
which
reasonable
excuses
came
into
play.
petitioners'
claim
they
were
trapped
that
their
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
your
honor,
it
was
--
the
robinson
case
was
decided
under
rule
45
and
rule
45
says
the
time
may
not
be
enlarged
under
rule
33,
34
and
35
as
well
as
the
time
for
filing
notices
of
appeal.
we
think
that
the
robinson
case
applies
now
i
quite
agree.
the
factual
--
the
justification
given
in
the
robinson
case
would
not
be
the
same
here.
here,
they
claim
that
they
were
entrapped
by
the
language.
i
think
however
that
--
that
excuse
is
certainly
no
better
than
the
one
that
was
suggested
to
this
court
in
the
robinson
case.
thank
you,
your
honors.
