chief

did
they
challenge
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
before
their
plea?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
terris?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
--
why
is
that
important
if
you
know?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
nolo
contendere
really
a
plea
to
the
indictment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
while
we're
on
that
background,
a
little
while
ago,
you
--
you
said
that
historically,
a
--
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment
was
to
be
made
before
a
judgment,
do
you
treat
of
that
in
your
--
in
your
briefs?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
--
how
are
we
to
know
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
historically,
et
cetera.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
would
think
that
--
that'd
be
rather
conclusive,
very
important
and
forceful
enough
not
to
argue
in
your
briefs
if
you
rely
on
it.
that
historically,
it
is
a
motion
that
is
to
be
made
before
judgment.
chief

warren
mr.
wellen?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
have
you
gone
into
the
history
of
motions
in
arrest
of
judgment
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
--
to
see
whether
his
counsel
stated
historically
they
ought
to
be
made
before
judgment?
