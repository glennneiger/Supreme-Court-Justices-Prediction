mr.
wellen,
curious
why
you're
so
confident
against
the
non-deterrent
effect
of
prosecutions?
you've
just
said
they're
bound
to
include?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
that
to
me
means
that
the
more
rigorous
the
law
is,
the
legislature
has
the
confidence
to
do
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
--
and
i
should
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
was
to
say
you
expressed
the
view
about
deterrent
effect
of
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
no
allowance
or
people
to
tell
you
what
they
meant
on
just
how
we
do
it.
(inaudible)
i
don't
meant
to
take
your
time,
proceed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
norris
case
has
some
sentence
about
--
leaving
only
a
sentence
to
be
imposed,
boesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
one
of
the
questions
before
us,
â€œdoes
it
satisfy,
if
it
agree
with
you
that
guilt
was
determined
by
the
tender
of
the
plea
of
nolo
contendere?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
question
that
was
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
everything
you
say
about
the
effect
of
nolo
certainly
would
advise
you
a
plea
of
guilty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
what
about
this
question
that
relates
this
plea
of
guilty?
what
do
the
authorities
say
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
10
day
and
five
days
run
from
the
--
from
the
plea
of
guilty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although
the
sentence
maybe
imposed
as
is
sometimes
done,
this
is
my
point
of
view,
it's
not
very
widely
just
to
find
out
about
what
sentence
to
impose,
but
then
that
it
--
it
postponed
or
sometimes
(inaudible),
although
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whereas
--
but
the
--
but
the
procedural
requirements
about
appealing
about
appeal
concerning
a
charge
all
begin
to
run
from
the
plea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
appeal
runs
from
the
--
the
10
days
or
five
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
the
sentence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
run
from
the
--
from
the
plea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
definitive
plea.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
practice,
those
things
to
be
(inaudible)
but
then
i've
got
out
of
the
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before
the
judgment
be
concerned
with
the
difficult
task
of
whether
it
doesn't
(inaudible)
or
is
--
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
has
to
have
it,
the
provisional
contentions
because
ther's
no
doubt
about
--
i
should
think
there's
no
doubt
(inaudible)
and
to
give
into
a
legal
determination
that
you
--
in
fact,
to
the
plea
of
guilty
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
rather
would
have
to
have
other
arguments
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
rules
committee
make
exquisite
or
greater
change
of
historical
--
of
many
historical
institutions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
say
anything
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
you're
saying
is
--
what
you're
--
i'm
not
saying
your
wrong,
i
have
no
doubt.
what
you're
saying
is
that
a
rule
turn
against
the
whole
course
of
this
thing
without
saying
a
word
about
--
without
saying,
that
is
it
or
why.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
really
(inaudible),
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
were
some
historians
--
there
were
illegal
historians
on
that
committee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
care
about
it.(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
they're
in
the
notes.
there
are
good
many
notes
on
many
of
the
--
of
their
rules.
justice
felix
frankfurter
extended
notes.
difference
that
would
be
--
and--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i'd
like
to
infer
by
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
from
this
--
this
reversal
history
was
made
without
any
exquisite,
either
that
is
--
was
a
reversal
(inaudible)
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
questioning
your
argument.
i
just
want
to
know
historic
facts.
