justice

frankfurter
the
position
you
were
urging
here,
you
would
urge
if
somebody
went
into
the
bookstore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
wanted
to
get
mr.
caton's
'the
history
of
the
civil
war'
or
whatever
it
is,
and
they
said,
thank
you
very
much.
you're
a
nice
man,
but
your
color
is
black,
or
your
religion
is
catholic
or
jewish
or
you're
agnostic.
wouldn't
you
be
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
i
know,
but
the
constitutional
proposition
you're
urging
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
that
this
is,
this
has,
as
it
were,
a
constitutional
public
easement
which
gives
every
american
citizen
who
hasn't
something
against
him
the
right
of
access
and
the
right
of
participating
in
what
they
offer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
it?
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
falls.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
of
the
construction
placed
upon
it
by
the
delaware
supreme
court,
but
the
claim
is
that
the
vice
is
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
restaurant
or
an
inn
or
a
bookshop
or
whatnot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
result
may
be
the
same,
but
there
is
a
distinction
argumentatively
or
in
reasoning,
between
a
restaurant
as
a
facility
for
those
who
park,
which
the
state
itself
is
furnishing,
namely
facilities
for
parking,
the
state
didn't
regard,
didn't
deem
a
restaurant
for
its
parkees
or
its
customers,
in
making
this
lease,
it
made
this
lease
in
order
to
get
money,
not
to
furnish
food,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that
were
decisive,
mr.
redding,
if
that
were
a
decisive
difference,
and
i'm
not
saying
it
is
or
it
isn't
or
it
is,
then
if
your
court
didn't
find
or
put
the
burden
on
you
of
showing
the
contrary,
that
would
be
a
kind
of
a
local
question
that
we
wouldn't
be
reviewing
here,
i
should
think.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
think
you
have
to
go
farther
and
say,
as
you
do
say,
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
lease
was
for
money
or
the
lease
was
to
supply
food,
as
it
was
suggested
in
the
boynton
case,
and
that
the
food
was
part
of
service
for
which
it
was
in
business.
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
leasing
in
order
to
have
money
to
carry
out
its
public
function,
and
therefore
the
state
is
entangled
in
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
delaware
court
makes
a
still
nicer
distinction
between
not
merely
a
state-operated
facility,
but
a
facility
leased
but
as
part
of
the
operation,
as
it
were,
the
totality.
in
other
words,
the
cafeteria
in
this
building,
which
is
open
for
lawyers
who
have
business
before
the
court,
is
deemed
to
be
a
facility
in
connection
with
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
had
in
mind
the
way
they
distinguished
the
derrington
case,
a
restaurant
in
a
courthouse.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
break
in?
that
third
fact
would
apply
to
every
leasing
because
whether
the
state
leases
in
order
to
derive
money
from
the
leasing
or
part
of
the
money
for
maintaining
the
state
enterprise,
or
whether
it's
to
go
into
the
fisc
of
the
state,
into
the
treasury
generally,
or
whether
any
deficit
is
to
be
covered
by
taxation
or
unidentified
state
funds
for
purposes
of
the
state
constitution,
it
seems
to
be
immaterial.
that's
merely
a
choice
of
how
the
state
does
the
financing,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
isn't
that
true,
as
a
matter
of
--
as
a
significant
factor,
that
it's
merely
an
expression
or
a
formulation
or
an
exercise
of
a
financial
choice
by
the
state
in
financing
the
enterprise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
not
foreclosing,
or
you
don't
you
want
the
court
to
foreclose,
assuming
they're
with
you
on
these
confirming
or
strengthening
items,
they're
not
confirming
that
any
lease
of
state
property
is
a
mode
by
which
the
state
exercises
its
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
implicit
starting
point,
the
implicit
premise
of
your
argument
i
take
it
is
that
this
is
precisely
a
field
where
case-by-case
unfolding
becomes
not
only
relevant
but
essential?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
revert
to
your
prior
point
(inaudible)
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
this
authority
had
to
be
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
by
the
law
of
delaware,
it
had
to
be
self-supporting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
both
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
go
beyond
the
circumference
of
this
case
in
all
events,
but
is
it
within
the
circumference
to
ask
whether
the
jewelry
shop,
is
one
of
these
things
a
jewelry
shop?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
spoke
at
the
outset,
you
said
that
this
restaurant,
as
it
were,
invited
everyone.
as
you
well
know,
at
the
common
law
every
business
engaged
in
business
was
called
a
common
calling
and
then
that
conception
shrunk
so
far
as
there
was
a
mandatory
duty
to
serve
everybody.
but
i
should
think
the
bookstore
or
the
jewelry
shop
in
this
building
are
no
less
inviting
tom,
dick,
and
harry,
than
this
restaurant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
suppose,
whether
or
not
the
authority
is
bound
to
limit
the
leases
which
it
negotiates
in
order
not
to
permit
discrimination
is
the
very
question
that
the
case
is
here
to
decide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
what
you
say
when
you
say
when
you
say
your
position
is
–
do
you
or
do
you
not
want
this
judgment
below
affirmed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
i
don't
see
why
isn't
perfectly
proper
for
you
to
take
that
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
you
shouldn't
–
you
shouldn't
consent
for
it.
all
i
want
to
know
is
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
as
an
approximation,
how
many
callings
in
delaware
require
permission
from
the
state,
i.e.,
a
certificate,
before
you
can
pursue
the
calling,
just
roughly?
could
they
be
six
or
sixty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
such
as?
justice
felix
frankfurter
plumbers
have
to
get
a
license?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
one
of
the
mooted
questions
in
delaware?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
referred
to
the
ashwander
case
several
times.
i'm
bound
to
say
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
the
relevance
of
that
case
to
the
problem
before
this
court.
it
was
relevant
to
the
problem
before
the
delaware
court
as
to
whether
when
the
eminent
domain
power
is
exercised
it
may
be
exercised
although
in
its
exercise
you
implicate
some
private
enterprise.
but
that
for
me
is
a
very
different
question
as
to
what
consequences
follow
by
virtue
of
the
relationship
of
the
so
called
private
enterprise
to
the
state
in
regard
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
ashwander
case
didn't
remotely
consider
the
problem
that
we
have
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
certainly,
and
therefore
all
that
case
did,
and
others,
and
that's
true
of,
i
should
think,
a
good
many
eminent
domain
cases
that
you
may
condemn
property
although
the
property
that
is
condemned
isn't
all
of
it
used
for
the
purposes
of
the
condemnation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
proposition?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
for
your
moving
on.
i
have
difficulty
with
your
starting
point
with
the
ashwander
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
of
the
doctrine,
the
obvious
doctrine
of
the
courts,
including
this
court,
of
excess
property
condemnation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
vague
--
these
are
unrelated
constitutional
provisions.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
haven't
got
--
the
discriminatory
aspect
which
you
draw
from
the
ashwander
case
was
not
before
the
court
in
the
ashwander
case
and
hasn't
been
before
the
court
since
and
so
we're
not
concerned
about
whether
the
tva
could,
or
its
trustees,
discriminatorily
serve
the
farmers
in
that
region.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
get
your
argument,
at
least
as
i
interpret
it,
your
position
is
that
allowing
through
excess
condemnation,
property
to
be
used
not
for
the
public
purpose
for
which
the
condemnation
was
made
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
therefore,
having
as
a
matter
of
economic
employment,
part
of
the
condemned
property
used
for
private
profits,
that
neither
tells
you
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies
nor
does
it
bar
it
from
applying,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
so
there
we
are.
in
fact,
you're
facing
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
herlihy,
the
solicitor
general
properly
or
naturally
enough
put
to
one
side
cases
that
he
thought
need
not
be
decided
in
deciding
this
case.
would
you
agree
that
the
simple
question
of
whether
tax
exemption
as
such
on
property
not
at
all
entangled
or
involved
or
mixed
up
with
anything
of
the
state,
merely
for
purposes
of
encouraging
certain
industries
or
certain
enterprises,
where
the
state
exempts
them
from
taxation
—
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
agree
that
we
don't
have
to
solve
–
we
don't
have
to
pronounce
on
that
question,
whether
discrimination
of
such
an
enterprise,
the
situs
in
case
of
new
york
that
this
case
is
not
that
case.
we've
got
ourselves
a
totally
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
we
can
decide
that
case
one
way
and
this
in
another.
it's
a
totally
different
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
all
i'm
saying
is
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
case
implicit
in
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
understood
i
refer
to
–
you
understand
i
am
just
speaking
from
my
own
temperamental
laziness
in
not
deciding
more
than
we
have
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
you
indicate,
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
that
mr.
chapman
occupies
the
public
position
that
he
did?
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you
that
people
may
have
known
that
this
was
a
restaurant
in
a
public
building?
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
people
did
know
or
didn't
know,
to
the
legal
question?
does
it
make
the
slightest
difference?
