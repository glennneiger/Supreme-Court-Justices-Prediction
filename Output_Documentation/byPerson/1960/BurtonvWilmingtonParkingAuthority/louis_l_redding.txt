may
it
please
your
honors.
william
h.
burton,
a
resident
of
wilmington,
delaware,
has
appealed
to
this
court
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
delaware,
sanctioning
on
the
authority
of
a
delaware
statute,
his
exclusion
on
the
ground
of
race
and
color
from
a
restaurant,
located
in
a
building,
owned
and
operated
by
a
public
agency,
the
wilmington
parking
authority.
the
authority
is
created
in
pursuance
of
a
delaware
statute.
this
statute
is
set
forth
in
full
in
the
appendix
to
the
appellant's
brief.
the
function
of
the
authority,
as
set
out
in
the
statute,
is
to
plan,
construct,
and
operate
facilities
for
offstreet
parking
of
automobiles.
the
act
declares
this
a
public
purpose
for
the
benefit
of
the
residents
of
cities,
for
the
promotion
of
their
health
and
safety
and
living
conditions.
accordingly,
the
act
declares
that
the
authority
is
a
public
agency
and
is
vested
with
the
performance
of
essential
governmental
functions.
members
of
the
authority
are
appointed
by
the
mayor
of
the
city.
the
authority
is
given
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
its
property
is
declared
exempt
from
delaware
taxation,
and
the
revenue
bonds
issued
by
the
authority
are
declared
exempt
from
delaware
taxation.
the
act
provides
that
municipalities
may
contribute
funds
to
the
authority
for
the
purchase
of
land
upon
which
the
parking
facilities
are
to
be
erected.
the
site
in
question,
located
in
the
city
of
wilmington,
is
an
area
about
178
feet
by
350
feet.
it
is
in
the
center
of
downtown
wilmington.
prior
to
its
present
use,
this
site
had
been
owned
by
several
private
owners.
it
was
purchased
by
the
wilmington
parking
authority
from
funds
derived
from
three
sources.
part
of
the
funds,
approximately
$934,000,
was
a
contribution
made
by
the
city
of
wilmington.
the
rest
of
the
funds
were
derived
from
the
revenue
bonds,
the
proceeds
of
revenue
bonds
of
the
authority,
and
from
a
bank
loan
made
to
the
authority
on
the
credit
of
the
authority.
the
act
under
which
the
authority
is
created
provides
that
the
authority
may
lease
portions
of
the
facility
for
commercial
use,
if
the
authority
has
made
a
determination
that
such
leasing
is
necessary
to
enable
the
authority
to
carry
on
its
public
function.
in
the
record
there
is
the
affidavit
of
the
chairman
of
the
authority,
attesting
that
such
a
determination,
that
is,
a
determination
that
leasing
was
necessary
in
order
to
enable
the
authority
to
function,
was
made
by
the
authority.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
leasing
for
commercial
purposes.
the
statute,
sir,
provides
that
the
authority
may
have
power
to
lease
part
of
the
space
in
the
structure
for
commercial
purposes
if
the
authority
has
determined
that
the
income
from
such
leasing
is
necessary
to
enable
the
authority
to
carry
on
its
public
function.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
the
statute
does
not
use
the
word
"private,"
sir.
it
simply
says
"for
commercial
purposes.
one
of
the
areas
of
space
in
the
facility
building
was
leased
to
the
appellee,
eagle.
eagle
is
a
corporation
organized
under
the
general
corporation
law
of
the
state
of
delaware,
and
its
lease
with
the
authority
was
for
a
period
of
twenty
years,
with
an
option
to
renew
for
ten
years.
and
the
lease,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
record,
provides
that
this
space
shall
be
used
for
a
restaurant,
a
banquet
hall,
a
cocktail
lounge,
a
bar,
and
for
no
other
use.
the
lease
also
provides,
among
other
terms,
that
the
lessee
shall
occupy
and
use
the
premises
in
accordance
with
all
applicable
laws
and
rules
and
regulations
of
the
federal
or
state
or
municipal
government.
the
lease
is
dated
april
8th,
1957.
there
is
in
the
record,
however,
an
affidavit
which
has
not
been
disputed
by
appellees
that
prior
to
the
date
of
this
lease
a
voluntary
citizens
group
had
discussed
with
the
chairman
of
the
authority,
their
interest
in
having
a
policy
of
racial
nondiscrimination
followed
in
the
restaurant.
in
august
1958,
the
appellant
burton
was
refused
food
service
in
the
restaurant
because
of
his
color.
in
a
class
action
brought
behalf
of
himself
and
other
negroes,
he
filed
a
suit
in
court
of
chancery
of
the
state
of
delaware
against
the
authority
and
the
restaurant
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
policy
racial
exclusion
practiced
by
the
restaurant
was
in
violation
of
the
restraints
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
for
an
injunction
to
restrain
his
discriminatory
exclusion
from
the
restaurant.
the
defendants,
the
authority
and
eagle,
filed
separate
answers.
the
authority
said,
in
its
answer,
that
it
had
no
power
under
its
lease
or
under
any
federal
or
state
law
to
control
its
lessee
and
the
lessee
also
said
that
it
was
not
controlled
by
the
authority.
both
of
them,
both
answers,
stated
that
eagle
operated
as
a
private
entrepreneur
and
both
of
them
pleaded
the
statute
which
is
here
in
question.
they
set
the
statute
out
in
their
answers.
it
is
title
24
of
the
delaware
code,
section
1501
and
they
said
in
their
answers
that,
on
the
basis
of
this
statute,
they
were
entitled
to
exclude
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
here.
i
should
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
this
statute
which
we
have
set
out
in
full
at
page
three
of
appellants'
brief
appendix.
it
provides
that
no
keeper
of
an
inn,
tavern,
hotel,
or
restaurant
or
other
place
of
public
entertainment
or
refreshment
of
travelers,
guests
or
customers,
shall
be
obliged
by
law
to
furnish
entertainment
or
refreshment
to
persons
whose
reception
or
entertainment
by
him
would
be
offensive
to
the
major
part
of
his
customers
and
would
injure
his
business.
it
defines
customers
as
including
all
who
have
occasion
for
entertainment
or
refreshment.
i
might
say
that
although
both
answers
pleaded
the
statute,
neither
answer
contained
an
averment,
a
direct
averment,
that
the
plaintiff
had
been
found
offensive
to
a
major
part
of
the
customers,
or
that
the
business
of
the
restaurant
had
been
in
any
way
impaired.
after
filing
the
answers,
the
defendants
moved
for
summary
judgment.
they
again
pleaded
the
statute
and
claimed
that
under
the
statute,
they
had
a
right
to
exclude
the
plaintiff
on
the
ground
of
color.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
yes
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
i
was
about
to
come
to
that
point.
they
did
file,
both
defendants
filed
sir,
motions
for
summary
judgment.
there
was
at
that
point
an
unresolved
issue
of
fact.
their
answers
had
not
been
responsive
on
the
allegation
contained
in
the
complaint
that
he
had
been
refused
service
because
of
his
race
and
color.
the
court,
of
course,
could
not
decide
this
matter
with
that
issue
of
fact
remaining
unresolved.
the
appellee,
eagle,
then
moved
to
amend
its
answer,
and
that
answer
is
contained
in
the
record
and
in
that
amendment
it
admitted
that
the
only
reason
for
refusal
of
service
to
the
plaintiff
here
was
his
race,
color,
and
ancestry.
this
was
spelled
out
specifically
in
the
amended
answer.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
there
was
still
no
alleâ€”
mr.
louis
l.
redding
there
was
still
no
allegation,
sir,
of
offensive-ness
to
the
major
part
of
the
customers
of
the
restaurant,
or
injury
to
business.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
nothing
of
that
sort,
sir.
the
only,
the
only
ground
upon
which
his
exclusion
was
defended
was
the
sole
ground
of
ancestry,
color,
race.
after
the
omission
had
been
repaired
by
the
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
sir?
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct,
sir.
we
were
coming
to
that,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is,
in
the
context
in
which
this
matter
comes
up,
this
is
the
only
thing
that
can
be
inferred.
the
trial
court,
after
the
omission
was
repaired
by
the
filing
of
an
amended
answer,
heard
arguments
in
the
matter
and
received
briefs,
of
course,
first
and
after
briefs
had
been
filed
and
oral
argument
had
been
had,
the
trial
court
requested
the
plaintiffs'
counsel
to
file
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
this
was
done,
and
two
days
later
the
trial
court
handed
down
its
opinion
which
is,
of
course,
part
of
the
record,
in
which
it
decided
that
because
the
rentals
constitute
a
substantial
and
integral
part
of
the
means
devised
to
finance
this
vital
public
facility,
and
those
are
the
words
used
by
the
trial
court,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
authority
to
make
leases
which
would
require
the
tenant
to
carry
out
the
authority's
constitutional
duty
not
to
deny
the
delawareans
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
the
authority,
although
--
although
the
authority
and
eagle
defended
on
the
ground
of
the
statute
in
part,
because
the
vice
chancellor
felt
that
there
was
state
action
in
the
operation
of
this
restaurant,
he
found
it
unnecessary
to
consider
the
statute
and
he
indicated
in
his
opinion
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
consider
the
validity
of
the
statute.
the
defendants
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
delaware,
and
it
was
there
pointed
out
in
briefs
and
oral
argument
that
there
had
been
no
proof
as
to
the
elements
of
offense,
an
injury
to
business.
and
they
took
the
same
position,
the
authority
there
took
the
position
before
the
supreme
court
which
it
had
taken
before
the
trial
court,
and
that
was
that
they
did
not
need
to
offer
proof
that
plaintiff,
as
a
negro,
was
offensive,
that
it
was
a
notorious
fact
that,
being
a
negro
he
was
offensive
and
that
the
court
could,
in
the
language
of
the
authority
in
its
brief,
"the
court
could
resort
to
a
judicial
shortcut
and
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
persons
of
a
certain
class,
meaning
negroes
the
class
to
which
the
plaintiff
belonged,
"were
per
se
offensive,"
was
the
language
used
in
the
brief
of
the
authority.
in
spite
of
the
absence
of
any
evidence
as
to
offensiveness
and
injury
to
business,
the
supreme
court
validated
this
interpretation
which
the
authority
insisted
upon.
it
held
that
eagle
was
acting
in
a
purely
private
capacity
and
that
under
the
statute
it
was
not
required
to
serve
the
appellant.
accordingly,
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
reversed
the
vice
chancellor.
now,
it
is
appellant's
position
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
because
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
has
construed
and
applied
the
statute
to
authorize
appellant's
exclusion
on
the
ground
of
race
from
this
restaurant,
and
that
this
application
of
the
statute
has
been
made
in
spite
of
the
challenge
made
to
the
statute
on
constitutional
grounds
by
the
appellant.
we'd
first
like
to
point
out
that
it's
clear
that
exclusion
of
appellant
as
a
negro
is
not
within
the
express
terms
of
the
statute.
we
think
that
if
it
had
been,
there
could
be
no
question,
but
that
this
statute
would
violate
equal
protection.
this,
of
course,
would
be
in
accordance
with
rules
which
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
expression
of
the
court
in
the
hirabayashi
case,
in
which
the
court
said
that
distinctions
between
citizens
solely
because
of
ancestry
are,
by
their
very
nature,
odious
to
a
free
people
whose
institutions
are
founded
upon
the
doctrine
of
equality.
the
same
type
of
expression
was
given
by
this
court
a
year
later
in
1944
in
the
korematsu
case,
in
which
it
was
stated
that
it
should
be
noted,
to
begin
with,
that
all
legal
restrictions
which
curtail
the
civil
rights
of
a
single
racial
group
are
immediately
suspect.
on
the
basis
of
the
war
emergency
with
which
both
the
hirahavashi
and
the
korematsu
cases
dealt,
and
the
necessity
of
protecting
the
country
against
sabotage
and
espionage,
the
court
did
permit
racial
distinctions
to
be
made
with
respect
to
a
curfew
order
and
relocation
camps
in
these
cases.
but
the
court
specifically
said
that
it
would
require
exceptional
circumstances
for
race
to
be
considered
a
factor,
a
constitutional
factor,
but
the
racial
distinction
here
does
not
derive
from
anything
expressly
stated
in
the
statute.
it
comes
from
the
judicial
action,
this
from
the
meaning
the
court
below
read
into
a
statute
which
on
its
face
is
ethnically
neutral,
silent,
and
from
the
effects
given
the
statute
as
so
interpreted.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
the
paragraph
next
to
the
last,
did
you
say,
sir?
mr.
louis
l.
redding
it
was
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
sir,
the
court
said
that
at
common
law,
apparently
the
court
here
meant
that
at
common
law
a
restaurant,
in
contradistinction
to
an
inn
or
a
tavern,
could
exclude
individuals,
or
anybody
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
but
i
think
--
we
think,
sir,
that
this
is
an
entirely
different
thing
from
the
courts
giving
sanction
to
a
common
law
discrimination
which
is
based
on
the
ground
of
color.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
that
the
court
was
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
it's
in
the
context,
sir,
in
which
the
case
comes
up.
the
reliance
of
the
defendants
here
was
placed
on
the
statute.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
we
think
the
opinion
validates
the
statute
itself,
sir.
and
even
if
it
were
a
common
law
principle,
we
think
that
the
court
could
not
give
effect,
against
the
constitutional
objection
made
to
it,
to
a
common
law
principle
which
permits
discrimination
upon
the
basis
of
race.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
it
is
not
â€“
mr.
louis
l.
redding
we
would
say
that
the
common
law
has
simply
been
superseded
completely
by
the
statute.
the
common
law
no
longer
has
any
force
or
effect.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
he
was
excluded,
sir,
because
of
his
race,
not
on
the
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
sir?
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
it's
set
forth
in
the
amended
answer
filed
by
eagle
here.
later
they
argued
that
they
could
exclude
anybody
they
wanted
to,
but
in
their
answer
which
they
filed
they
stated
that
the
plaintiff
was
excluded
solely
upon
the
basis
of
race
or
color.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
it
is
our
position
that
they
cannot,
sir,
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
i
would
say
that
they're
bound
by
the
reason
they
have
given,
and
that
this
gives
us
a
basis
to
make
the
constitutional
objection
we
seek
to
make
here.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
here
they
gave
a
reason.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
oh,
no
sir,
no
sir.
our
brief
develops
both
points.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
we
have
filed
an
appeal
here
because
we
think
that
the
court's
opinion,
even
though
it
may
not
explicit
say
so,
does
give
validity,
that
is
the
effect
of
what
the
court
has
done
here
is
to
give
validity
to
this
statute.
and
â€“
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
that's
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
it
did,
sir,
and
sought
to
distinguish
it.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
it
had
equipped,
yes,
it
had
equipped
it
for
public
use,
sir,
but
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is,
the
leasing
here
is
an
essential
part
of
the
ability
of
the
public
agency
to
carry
on
its
public
function.
without
the
leasing,
the
agency
could
not
serve
the
public
purpose
that
the
statute
contemplated
it
should
serve.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
i
think
the
legislature
recognized
that
such
a
leasing
would
be
an
impermissible
one,
and
it
limited
the
type
of
leasing
in
which
it
might
engage
to
leasing
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
yes,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
lessee
was
to
use
the
leased
premises
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
sir?
mr.
louis
l.
redding
who
paid
for
it?
mr.
louis
l.
redding
i
already
indicated-
mr.
louis
l.
redding
sir?
mr.
louis
l.
redding
it
is
a
structure.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
a
structure
which
contains
about
61
percent
of
the
area
which
is
devoted
to
the
parking
of
automobiles.
about
39
percent
of
the
area
is
devoted
to
commercial
lessees
mr.
louis
l.
redding
the
entire
structure
was
paid
for
by
public
funds
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
insofar,
insofar
as
the
lessee
was
unable
to
pay
the
rent,
the
authority
would
lose
the
money.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
yes,
there
are,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
well,
there
is
a
bookstore,
a
jeweler's
retail
store.
there
was
a
food
store,
a
retail
food
store.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
i
would
certainly
not.
we
would
not
be
here
talking
about
the
statute.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
would
not
be
an
applicable
defense
for
that
type
of
business,
but
we
would
be
here
on
the
state
action
aspect
of
this
case.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
we
would
be
here
on
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
--
an
application
certiorari
and
we
have
asked
of
this
court,
if
this
court
considers
that
appeal
does
not
lie,
that
the
matter
â€”
mr.
louis
l.
redding
--
should
be
considered
on
certiorari.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
i
would,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
we
would
be
here,
sir,
but
the
statute
would
not
be
involved.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
it
is
the
same.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is-well,
that's
part
of
our
position.
the
rest
of
our
position
is
that
this
court
having,
the
delaware
supreme
court
having
construed
this
statute
to
authorize
the
exclusion
of
this
plaintiff
on
the
ground
of
his
color,
also
entitles
us
to
be
here.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
our
position,
sir.
i
had
â€“
i
had
intended
your
honors
to
point
out
that
even
if
the
statute
on
its
face
were
valid,
that
is,
if
it
did
--
could
validly
permit
the
exclusion
of
persons
who
were
offensive
to
the
major
part
the
customers,
that
this
type
of
test
would
have
to
be
employed
by
the
business
here.
instead
of
employing
the
test
here,
the
court
indulged
in
a
presumption
and
we
say
that
this,
the
fact
presumed
has
absolutely
no
relationship
to
the
fact
proved.
the
only
thing
proved
here
was
that
the
plaintiff
was
a
negro.
there
is
no
rational
connection
between
his
being
a
negro
and
his
being
offensive.
we
might
also
say
that
his
offensiveness
could
not
have
been
proven
under
the
statute
if
the
court
had
relied
upon
evidence
which
is
in
the
record.
in
the
record,
there
are
affidavits
which
were
introduced
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
showing
that
similar
places
in
wilmington
community
do
not
exclude
persons
on
the
ground
of
color.
the
delaware
supreme
court
here
in
reversing
the
chancellor
held
that
there
was
no
state
action,
that
there
was
only
private
action
which
was
immune
from
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
opinion
is
founded
on
three
grounds.
we'd
like
to
examine
each
of
these
grounds.
first
the
court
said
that
the
establishment
of
a
restaurant
in
his
facility
was
a
happenstance,
and
that
the
restaurant
was
not
intended
as
a
service
to
the
public
using
the
parking
facility
that
the
only
interest
of
the
authority
was
in
obtaining
income
from
rent.
the
answer
to
that
seems
to
be
that
there
is
no
evidence
one
way
or
another
as
to
whether
or
not
the
location
of
the
restaurant
in
the
authority
was
a
happenstance.
this
matter
was
decided
on
summary
judgment
and
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
how
the
restaurant,
rather
than
something
else,
happened
to
be
located
there.
but
we
say
that,
more
important
than
this
ground
that
the
supreme
court
used,
was
the
interest
of
the
authority
in
obtaining
rental
income.
and
this
interest
was
completely
coextensive
with
the
interest
of
the
authority
in
performing
its
public
function,
that
it
could
not
have
performed
its
public
function
if
there
had
not
been
this
rental
income.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
we
don't
know,
sir.
as
i
say,
this
matter
was
decided
on
summary
judgment.
had
the
matter
gone
to
trial,
we
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
find
out
exactly
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
yes,
i
see
â€“
mr.
louis
l.
redding
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
i
am
not
aware
that
there
are,
sir.
i
might
say
that
the
public
parks,
as
they
are
operated,
do
not
follow
a
policy
of
racial
discrimination.
our
position
here,
sir,
is
that,
as
i
have
said,
this
court
has
interpreted
a
statute
to
permit
the
exclusion
of
the
plaintiff
here
on
the
ground
of
race;
and
this,
we
think,
is
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
addition
to
that,
we
say
that
the
identity
between
the
lessee
and
the
lessor
here
is
so
close
that
the
restraints
of
the
constitution
should
apply
not
only
to
the
lessor
--
to
the
lessee,
just
as
they
do
to
the
lessor.
for
these
reasons
we
think
that
the
opinion
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
would
briefly
like
to
summarize
the
position
of
the
appellant
here.
however,
before
i
do
that
i
hope
the
court
will
permit
me
to
make
one
digression
which
is
not
in
the
record,
and
i
would
assume
to
do
that
only
because
there
have
been
a
number
of
references
made
to
facts
which
are
not
in
the
record.
your
honor,
the
chief
justice
presumed
a
hypothetical
case
in
which
the
land
on
which
the
facility
is
now
erected
had
been
occupied
by
disadvantaged
members
of
a
minority.
this
was
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
this
land
was
extremely
valuable
land
in
the
center
city
which
was
then
used
for
a
commercial
purpose.
so
that
the
plaintiff
here
was
not
disadvantaged
in
that
manner,
but
the
fact
outside
the
record
i'd
like
to
mention
is
the
fact
that
the
plaintiff
is
a
member
of
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
wilmington,
delaware,
a
fact
which
is
well
known
to
all
the
parties
in
this
matter,
and
was
well
known
to
the
courts.
now,
i
mention
that
not
as
giving
him
any
rights
superior
to
the
rights
of
any
members
of
the
class
whom
he
represents,
but
as
indicating
that
as
a
member
of
city
council,
which
under
the
statute
which
creates
this
authority,
has
the
right
to
confirm
persons
appointed
to
the
authority,
he
did
have
intimate
knowledge
of
the
operation
of
this
parking
facility.
he
brought
his
action
merely
as
a
member
of
the
minority
group,
and
the
basis
of
his
claim
was
that
this
was
state
property.
now,
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
all
of
the
indicia
of
state
property
which
associate
with
this
particular
facility.
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
relationship
of
the
lessee
to
the
lessor
here
is
that
the
legislature
prohibits
leasing
except
insofar
as
leasing
is
necessary
to
carry
out
a
governmental
function.
to
that
extent,
the
lessee
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
public
lessor
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
a
public
function.
and
it
is
the
position
of
the
appellant
here
that
this
instrumentality
of
the
public
lessor
should
be
affected
by
the
same
constitutional
restraints
that
the
public
lessor
is.
mr.
louis
l.
redding
i
said,
sir,
i
tried
to
indicate
that
--
mr.
louis
l.
redding
it
does
not,
sir.
it
does
not.
now,
may
i
say
â€“
may
i
go
--
however,
that
is
one
aspect,
that
is
the
fact
that
this
is
a
public
property,
was
the
fact
that
brought
him
was
the
legal
basis,
that
brought
him
in
the
court
originally,
after
he
got
into
the
court
of
chancery,
he
was
furnished
a
second
legal
basis
to
oppose
this
discrimination.
the
defendants
defended
on
the
basis
of
a
state
statute,
and
they
said
that
this
state
statute
gave
them
the
right
to
discriminate
against
this
individual
because
of
his
association
with
the
particular
ethnic
minority.
now,
this
was
state
action.
that
is,
the
interpretation
by
the
court
that
this
meaning
which
the
defendants
ascribed
to
the
statute
was
a
valid
meaning,
made
the
statute
mean
exactly
what
the
defendants
said
it
meant
and
so
by
state
judicial
action
giving
legal
force
and
effect
to
a
racially
discriminatory
statute,
the
defendant
brings
his
appeal,
and
he
bases
his
appeal
on
that.
and
we
ask
the
court
not
only
to
declare
that
there
is
state
action
here
because
of
the
fact
that
the
private
lessee
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
public
lessor
in
effectuating
the
public
purpose,
but
also
because
here
is
a
statute
of
the
state
of
delaware
which
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
delaware
says
may
be
used
to
discriminate
against
people
because
of
an
extraneous
fact
like
their
ancestry.
and
we
say
that
time
after
time
this
court
has
held
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
so
for
these
--
on
these
two
grounds,
not
only
is
the
defendant
in
court,
but
on
these
two
grounds
it
is
our
belief
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
we
respectfully
request
such
a
reversal.
