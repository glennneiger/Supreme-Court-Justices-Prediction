it's
now
a
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
under
the
common
law,
permitted
by
the
common
law,
is
now
permitted
by
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
this
man
excluded,
according
to
the
record,
because
they
--
on
the
basis
that
they
could
exclude
anybody
they
wanted
to,
or
did
they
exclude
him
because
he
was
colored?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
agreed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
agreed
between
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they're
permitted
to
(inaudible)
assume
inquiry
was
based
on
(inaudible)
suppose
the
law
does
permit
them
to
exclude
anybody
they
want
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
that
mean
that
they
can
constitutionally
exclude
somebody
wholly
because
of
his
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
delaware
court
refer
to
the
case
of
derrington
against
plummer
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
basis?
there
was
an
exclusion
from
a
restaurant,
the
court
had
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
paid
for
this
parking
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
paid
for
this
parking
authority?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
whose
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
it,
a
park?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
whole
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
one
structure?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whose
money
paid
for
the
whole
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
taxpayers?
the
city
of
wilmington
contributed
at
one
time
$934,000,
at
another
time
$1,822,000.
some
of
the
funds
came
from
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
revenue
bonds,
so
that
the
entire
financing
was
derived
from
public
funds.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
this
lease
fails
--
the
lessee
failed
to
carry
on
properly
and
they
lost
money,
who
lost
the
money,
taxpayers
or
â€“
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
any
restaurants
in
your
public
parks
run
by
concessionaires?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
property
exempt
from
taxation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
the
physical
building
part
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
restaurant
owner's
part
of
it
is
not
exempt
from
the
taxation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
point
is,
no
one
has
to
pay
any
tax
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
equipment
inside,
for
the
restaurant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
there
was
20,000
dollars
spent
on
equipment
and
so
forth.
justice
hugo
l.
black
220,000.
p"
justice
hugo
l.
black
220,000
and
you
have
no
tax
on
that
ordinarily
in
delaware
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i
meant.
how
could
you
put
all
this
equipment
in
on
this
skeleton
without
having
it
as
part
of
the
real
estate?
why
isn't
the
tax
exemption
greatly
increased
by
the
work
that
was
done
on
that
place?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
we
do
have
that
in
this
case,
do
we
not
for
whatever
relevance
any
particular
member
of
the
court
wants
to
give
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
involved
the
rest
of
us
in
that
case?[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
time
is
up,
but
there
is
one
question
i
wish
you
would
answer
(inaudible).
as
i
understand
it,
you've
argued
this
case,
the
case
has
been
argued
on
the
basis
that
the
power
and
rights
of
the
state
in
leasing
property
owned
by
all
of
your
people
of
the
state
is
no
greater
and
no
less
with
reference
to
the
obligations
imposed
on
it
in
leasing
and
though
the
state
were
a
private
human
being.
your
whole
argument
is
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
when
the
state
owns
property
which
it
decides
to
use
and
lease,
not
sell,
but
lease,
all
the
rights
that
a
private
person
would
have
in
making
that
lease
the
state
must
have
although
it
can
or
could
use
that
method
of
regulating
the
use
of
the
property,
instead
of
passing
laws
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
lease?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
have
done
it.
