mr.
clair
john
killoran
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
the
wilmington
parking
authority,
the
appellee
that
i
represent,
respectfully
submit
that
there's
only
one
question
in
this
case,
that
is
on
the
merits
and
that
is
whether
the
action
or
the
conduct
of
eagle
can
fairly
be
said
to
be
the
conduct
of
the
authority,
and
thus
state
action
inhibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
as
we
know,
the
courts
have
held
on
numerous
occasions
that
private
acts
of
discrimination
are
not
as
such
illegal.
when,
however,
governmental
discrimination
as
opposed
to
private
discrimination
is
charged,
it
then
becomes
the
duty
of
the
court
to
examine
the
facts,
and
if
the
facts
support
the
charge,
to
prevent
the
discrimination
and,
of
course,
the
authority
subscribes
to
those
principles.
the
cases
cited
by
all
the
parties
in
this
case
are
rested
on
various
grounds,
but
i
think
it
is
generally
agreed
that
general
definitions
of
state
action
are
not
apt
in
all
factual
contexts.
therefore,
it
would
seem
appropriate
that
we
examine
the
pertinent
facts,
the
real
facts
in
this
case,
to
see
if
those
facts
support
the
charge
made
by
mr.
burton,
the
appellant.
after
the
wilmington
parking
authority
acquired
the
land
at
ninth
and
shipley
streets
in
the
city
of
wilmington,
delaware,
on
which
the
subject
facility
and
subject
restaurant
are
located,
it
retained
experts
to
advise
it
on
what
type
of
structure
should
be
erected
to
accommodate
parking.
the
authority
was
advised
that
the
streets
in
this
area
would
only
accommodate
a
certain
given
number
of
motor
vehicles,
and
that
a
multi-level
masonry
building
should
be
constructed
to
accommodate
that
number
of
cars.
the
financial
forecasts
were
prepared,
and
on
the
basis
of
those
forecasts
the
underwriters
concluded
that
the
parking
facility
as
planned
could
not
be
financed
from
parking
revenue
alone.
so
then
the
authority
elected
to
exercise
a
right
granted
to
it
under
the
enabling
act
and
provide
space
for
commercial
leasing
in
addition
to
the
parking
space
that
was
required
and
recommended
by
the
consulting
engineers.
the
parking
space
itself
was
not
curtailed
or
diminished.
the
building
was
redesigned
to
provide
for
additional
space
which
would
be
commercial
space.
with
the
anticipated
revenue
from
rentals
as
well
as
the
parking
revenues,
the
underwriters
purchased
the
bonds
in
the
aggregate
amount
of
2.5
million
dollars.
even
though
the
city
of
wilmington
paid
all
the
consideration
for
the
land,
the
facility
itself
was
constructed
from
the
proceeds
of
the
revenue
bonds,
with
one
exception.
in
respect
to
the
commercial
space,
only
roofs
and
walls
and
basements
were
constructed.
in
all
the
commercial
space
the
tenants
had
to
construct
their
own
facilities,
own
finishings,
own
furnishings,
own
decorations,
own
air
conditioning,
at
their
own
cost,
without
any
right
of
reimbursement
from
the
authority.
we
advertised
for
public
bids
for
commercial
space,
and
prior
to
the
closing
date
for
the
bids
a
mr.
rankin,
a
taxpayer
of
the
city
of
wilmington,
threatened
to
attempt
to
enjoin
the
authority
from
entering
the
field
of
private
enterprise
by
leasing
commercial
space.
the
authority
immediately
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
action
in
our
court
of
chancery,
and
under
a
provision
of
our
state
constitution
it
was
certified
directly
to
our
supreme
court,
which
is
our
court
of
last
resort.
the
supreme
court
sustained
the
right
of
the
authority
to
lease
commercial
space,
to
the
extent
but
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
necessary
and
feasible
to
help
finance
the
contemplated
project.
now
the
supreme
court
ruled
that
we
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
competitive
bidding
and
that
we
had
to
request
bids
again.
now,
after
the
rankin
case,
the
enabling
act
was
amended
in
order
to
permit
the
authority
to
negotiate
the
leases
if
after
requests
for
competitive
bids
were
made
and
none
received,
or
if
received,
if
rejected
by
the
authority,
then
the
authority
could
negotiate
leases
for
this
commercial
space.
after
we
requested
competitive
bids
and
none
were
received,
over
a
period
of
time,
and
a
substantial
period
of
time,
we
finally
negotiated
four
leases
for
the
commercial
space,
one
such
being
that
of
eagle
which
is
being
discussed
here.
the
eagle
lease
appears
in
the
record
beginning
on
page
13.
and
if
you'll
examine
the
lease
you
will
note,
few
minor
items,
with
the
exception
of
a
few
minor
items
that
the
authority
is
to
provide,
eagle
at
its
own
sole
cost
expense
is
responsible
for
constructing
a
restaurant,
all
finishings,
all
decorations,
all
fixtures,
all
air
conditioning
and
eagle
retained
its
own
architect,
its
own
engineers,
its
own
contractors,
and
paid
for
the
construction
of
the
facility
out
of
its
own
funds
without
right
of
any
reimbursement
from
the
city,
state,
or
the
authority.
it's
submitted,
your
honors,
that
the
authority
in
reality
leased
four
unfinished
masonry
walls,
an
unfinished
roof,
an
unfinished
floor,
and
basement
to
eagle,
and
eagle
constructed
a
restaurant,
bars,
cocktail
lounges,
and
banquet
rooms
in
and
on
the
property
of
the
facility.
now,
mr.
cox
has
mentioned
about
our
signs
--
mr.
clair
john
killoran
the
authority
provides
heat
only,
and
it
only
retains
control
in
the
event
of
default
under
the
lease,
whether
through
bankruptcy
or
any
other
manner
of
default,
it
can
evict.
it
has
no
control
over
the
restaurant
as
such
and
its
operations,
its
policies
or
whatnot.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
yes,
it
does
have
that
control,
chief
justice,
because
in
negotiating
leases
we
couldn't
have
negotiated
successfully
with
eagle
if
we're
going
to
have
another
restaurant
right
next
to
it.
so
in
the
lease
itself,
it
restricts
the
use
to
the
restaurant
purposes,
including
bars
and
banquet
rooms.
the
lease
so
provides
and
provides
they
can
only
use
it
for
that
purpose.
now,
when
this
restaurant
was
completed,
the
construction
of
it
was
completed,
it
was
not
provided,
nor
is
there
provided
today
any
public
entrance
from
the
parking
facility
itself
to
the
restaurant,
or
as
a
matter
of
fact,
to
any
of
the
tenants
are
there
public
entrances
from
the
parking
facility
to
the
tenant.
the
pubic
entrance
to
the
eagle
is
on
the
street
level
on
ninth
street,
and
you
enter
directly
into
eagle,
and
on
the
first
floor
level
it
has
three
large
beautiful
dining
rooms,
with
a
bar
and
cocktail
lounge.
you
go
to
the
basement
level,
it
has
banquet
rooms
and
accommodations
for
upwards
of
300
people.
i
bring
this
out
at
this
time
with
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
illustrate
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
parking
authority
to
provide
service
for
the
benefit
of
the
patrons
of
the
authority
it
had
only
one
sole
purpose,
as
expressed
in
the
enabling
act
itself
to
obtain
revenues,
rental
income.
that
was
the
only
purpose.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
the
lease
has
the
usual
canned
provisions
as
we
refer
to
it
that
they
will
abide
by
all
federal,
state,
county
laws,
rules
and
regulations.
that's
all
there
is
in
it.
there's
no
–
mr.
clair
john
killoran
oh,
i
would
think
they
would
be
binding
on
the
authority
if,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
answers
the
question
in
the
affirmative
that
these
facts
do
support
the
appellant's
charge,
certainly
i
do.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
would
i
have
that
power?
mr.
clair
john
killoran
i
probably
would
have
that
power
as
the
authority,
but
i
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
leases.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
i
anticipated
that
question,
chief
justice.
in
the
first
place,
i
practically
grew
up
with
the
authority
i
wrote
the
enabling
act
and
i
wrote
these
leases
and
i
negotiated
the
leases.
and
we
negotiated
them
conscientiously
and
in
good
faith
on
the
ground
that
we
were
leasing
to
private
enterprise
for
a
private
use
and
secondly
the
authority
felt
that
we
should
appear
so
that
this
court
would
have
all
the
pertinent
facts
before
it
in
order
that
it
could
examine
those
facts
to
determine
if
the
charge
should
be
sustained.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
no,
sir.
i
mean
that
we
negotiated—that
i
have
a
different
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court's
decision
than
does
mr.
cox.
we
negotiated,
we
felt
under
the
rankin
case
with
individual
enterprise,
private
enterprise,
to
grant
them
a
use
that
was
private
use
and
not
a
public
use.
the
fourteenth
amendment
never
entered
our
minds.
we
felt
that
we
–
mr.
clair
john
killoran
the
lease
provides
that
the
tenant
or
the
lessee
in
the
use
of
the
property
shall
comply
with
all
laws
of
public
authorities,
federal,
state,
and
city
ordinances,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
that's
pretty
broad,
and
what
would
be
meant
normally
in
a
case
of
this
kind
where
there's
no
discrimination
that
they
would
comply
with
the
local
health
laws,
police
regulations;
assume
the
congress
extended
the
minimum
wage
to
restaurants
and
retail
outlets,
to
comply
with
that
type
of
law,
the
pure
food
and
drug
act
and
various
other
things
that
we
had
in
mind
that
they
might
--
we
should
have
control
over
them
to
make
them
comply
with.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
not
the
racial
one.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
that
is
correct,
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
well,
we're
a
party
to
the
contract.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
it
does
not
have
a
thing
to
do
with
segregation,
but
the
authority
negotiated
in
good
faith
with
these
various
tenants
on
the
basis
that
it'd
be
a
private
use
and
not
a
public
use,
such
as
we're
referring
to.
i
think,
in
fairness
to
the
tenants,
in
fairness
to
the
people
we
negotiated
with,
they
demand
our
support
in
this.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
well,
i
don't
know
that
i
would
in
that
particular
instance.
i'm
talking
about
now
only
fairness
and
honesty
in
the
negotiations
that
we
conducted.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
i
think,
chief
justice,
philosophically
i
would
agree
with
you.
however,
we
feel,
on
i
think
good
grounds
that
i
think
i
can
still
demonstrate,
that
there
are
two
uses
in
this
property.
one
is
a
private
use
and
one
is
a
public
use,
and
our
supreme
court
in
the
rankin
case
so
held.
it
expressly
held
that
the
commercial
leasing
was
absolutely
unrelated
to
the
public
use
of
parking
and
it
permitted
the
authority,
the
state
agency,
to
trespass
upon
private
enterprise
slightly,
because
the
dominant
and
underlying
purpose
of
the
authority
was
to
be
subservient
to
a
public
use.
i
think
the
facts
in
the
case
are
such
that,
from
an
attorney's
point
of
view,
at
least
mine
in
studying
it,
i
feel
that
i
should
take
the
position
that
it's
private
use
and
not
public
use.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
well,
we
can
condemn
--
no,
we
can't
except
–
there
is
one
statute
gives
the
power
companies
the
right,
and
that's
a
private
use
--
mr.
clair
john
killoran
and
the
--
mr.
clair
john
killoran
i
think
for
this
reason.
i
think
we've
got
to
look
at
two
or
three
different
facets.
one,
the
purpose
of
the
commercial
leasing
was
for
revenue,
and
it's
our
position,
and
i
think
it's
a
fairly
sound
position,
that
merely
because
eagle
pays
rent
to
the
authority,
its
private
use
as
a
restaurant
does
not
change
to
a
public
one
any
more
than
a
governing
body
exacting
revenue
through
taxation
from
a
private
corporation
places
that
private
corporation
in
the
category
of
a
public
corporation
and
also,
if
we
keep
these
facts
in
mind,
and
the
tests
that
have
been
laid
down
in
the
various
cases,
eagle
constructed
its
restaurant
on
this
public
property.
eagle
spent
over
240,000
dollars
on
this
restaurant.
that's
not
in
the
record,
but
that's
a
fact.
eagle
was
not
invited
there;
it's
a
happenstance
it's
there,
but
when
it
did
negotiate
this
lease,
there
was
no
thought
or
no
intent
on
the
part
of
either
party
that
it
should
serve
a
public
purpose,
namely,
serve
the
patrons
of
the
authority.
and
also
there
is,
i
would
think,
that
if
those
facts
are
accepted,
and
the
only
reason
is
that
income
only
was
required,
and
there's
no
factual
situation
that
indicates
that
it's
being
used
for
public
use,
i
don't
see
how
the
fourteenth
amendment
applies.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
chief
justice,
we
could
have
condemned
all
the
ground
that
we
thought
was
necessary
for
not
only
the
parking
facility
itself,
but
for
the
additional
commercial
space.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
no,
sir,
we
could
not.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
it
becomes
an
inseparable
part
of
that
which
is
a
public
building,
but
not
a
public
purpose,
i
don't
think.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
our
supreme
court
in
the
rankin
case
answered
that
question
in
this
manner
-
it
said
that
--
it
held
that
the
authority
could
condemn.
it
also
held
that
it
could
enter
private
enterprise
to
the
extent,
but
only
to
the
extent,
that
it
was
feasible
for
financial
purposes.
our
supreme
court
in
that
case
followed
the
new
york
authority
case.
you'll
recall
in
that
case
the
new
york
port
authority
was
to
exercise
certain
obligations
under
a
compact
with
new
jersey
relating
to
transportation.
it
built
a
14-story
building,
and
it
only
utilized
the
first
two
floors
and
basement
for
the
purpose
of
the
port
authority.
the
rest
was
rented,
one,
two,
three
floors
rented
to
the
new
york
life
insurance
company
and
various
ones.
ninety-eight
percent
of
the
income
from
that
building
was
from
private
tenants.
now,
in
that
case
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
held
that
the
primary
purpose
was
transportation,
a
public
purpose;
they
sustained
the
right
of
the
authority
to
build
this
large
building
and
to
rent
it
for
private
uses,
private
purposes.
now,
our
court
followed
mainly
that
decision.
but,
answering
your
question
one
step
further,
i
think
that
we
got
to
distinguish
between
public
purpose
and
a
public
building.
now,
this
was
condemned
for
a
public
building;
but
it
wasn't
all
to
be
utilized
for
a
public
purpose.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
it
had
to
be
condemned
for
a
public
purpose.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
and,
under
our
enabling
act
the
--
and
as
sustained
by
our
court,
the
authority,
being
a
public
agency,
can
go
beyond
the
public
purpose
to
the
extent
necessary
to
finance.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
well,
i
think
it's
correct.
it
can
engage
in
collateral
activities
the
revenue
from
which
makes
the
public
purpose
self
sustainable.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
that's
right.
but
it
appears
to
us
your
honor
that
this
lease
was
not
used
for
purpose
of
discriminating
and
under
the
lease
itself
there's
no
joinder
in
the
enterprise
on
the
part
of
the
authority
or
no
reservation
of
control
on
the
part
of
the
authority
and
the
record
discloses
that
the
authority
has
never
even
suggested
or
advised
the
eagle
on
any
policy
of
admission
or
exclusion.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
–
that
the
act
of
leasing
here
and
the
lease
or
the
lease,
does
not
belong
to
long
series
of
strategems
that
governing
bodies
had
employed
in
attempt
to
deprive
the
negro
of
his
birth
right,
namely,
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
there's
only
one
single
purpose
here
and
that
was
revenue.
it's
a
form
of
taxation.
it's
a
form
of
obtaining
revenue
and
that
the
eagle
was
permitted
to
come
in
and
on
the
property,
public
property,
and
to
construct
there
on
its
facility
at
a
great
cost.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
it
constructed
with
public
money.
the
proceeds
from
the
bonds
are
public
money
because
the
legislature
must
authorize
the
bonds
and
the
proceeds
must
be
devoted
to
a
public
purpose.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
no,
sir,
the
land
was
a
gift.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
that
is
correct,
it
is
correct.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
no,
i
do
not
sir.
i
don't
--
we
are
not
administering
it.
as
i
see
it,
we
are
leasing
part
of
public
property
for
private
uses,
which
we
have
no
authority
to
administer
and
the
legislature,
that's
the
legislative
policy
of
the
state,
which
supersedes,
i
would
assume,
the
taxpayers'
particular
ideas.
it's
the
legislative
policy
of
the
state
that
we
can
lease
to
private
enterprise
and
the
enabling
act
so
provides,
if
necessary.
that
is
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
delaware.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
no,
but
in
answering
whether
or
not
the
taxpayers
should
have
some
particular
complaint
because
they've
paid
part
of
the
money,
when
they
paid
it
they
knew
that
part
of
the
facility
was
going
to
be
used
for
commercial
purposes.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
their
taxes.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
no,
i
don't
mean
that.
the
philosophy
of
it
is
that
if
a
taxpayer,
when
he
pays
his
taxes,
he's
certainly
not
conscious
of
all
the
uses
that
they're
going
to
put
the
funds
to.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
he
doesn't
even
know,
but
in
this
case,
the
taxpayer
did
know
and
tried
to
sue
them.
he
threatened
the
authority,
he
tried
to
enjoin
the
authority
because
they
were
going
into
private
enterprise
by
commercial
leasing
and
the
supreme
court
said
no.
the
state
legislature
has
declared
policy
that
off-street
parking
is
required,
and
in
connection
with
the
financing
only
now,
you
can't
do
this,
you
can't
lease
to
a
service
station;
you
can't
lease
to
certain
things,
but
otherwise,
and
on
competitive
bidding,
you
can
lease
to
private
enterprise
to
assist
you
in
obtaining
the
funds.
i
would
like
to
make
one
final
remark.
as
before
stated,
we
do
not
feel
that
this
lease
is
one
of
those
strategems
that's
been
used
by
the
authority,
or
eagle
either,
to
deprive
anybody
of
any
rights.
in
other
words,
we
feel
this
lease
does
not
fall
within
the
category
of
the
leases
described
and
referred
to
in
the
decisions
cited
by
the
government
and
by
the
appellant,
for
the
reason
that
in
those
leases,
all
involved
either
a
technique
to
evade
state
responsibility
or
that
the
property,
though
privately
operated,
was
being
used
for
public
purposes.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
well,
i
don't
think
we're
honor
bound
to
come
into
court
to
support
the
policy
of
discrimination.
i
thin
we're
honor
bound
to
come
into
this
court
and
give
the
court
the
real
background
and
circumstances
surrounding
the
negotiation
of
these
leases,
which
was
on
a
private
use
basis.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
that's
all
i'm
doing.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
shows
that
the
authority
does
not
discrirninate.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
in
that
respect,
my
position
is
neutral.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
right.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
authority,
over
sixty
percent
of
its
employees
are
negroes
and
anyone
can
park
in
the
authority
as
long
as
he
has
the
ability
to
pay
the
uniform
rate
fixed
for
that.
the
record
shows,
mr.
burton
in
this
particular
case,
before
he
went
to
the
eagle,
parked
his
car
in
the
facility.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
in
our
brief
we
so
request
it.
mr.
clair
john
killoran
well,
i
think
it
is
–
i
think
it
is
but
i
thought
of
it
and
i
have
talked
to
–
mr.
clair
john
killoran
and
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
our
position
should
be
as
i
stated.
