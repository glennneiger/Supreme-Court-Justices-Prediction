mr.
archibald
cox
may
it
please
the
court?
the
united
states
filed
a
brief,
and
has
obtained
leave
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument
in
this
case
on
the
merits,
because
it
involves
the
constitutional
rights
of
a
large
number
of
citizens,
and
also
because
of
the
interest
of
the
united
states
as
a
major
property
owner.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that's
the
only
one,
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
our
position
is
that,
whatever
may
be
the
rule
with
respect
to
discrimination
by
a
private
enterprise
upon
privately
owned
property,
the
denial
of
equal
protection
upon
racial
grounds
in
a
restaurant
otherwise
open
to
the
general
public
on
state-owned
property,
indeed
in
a
state
building,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
results
in
unconstitutional
discrimination
violating
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
i
should
say
that
my
argument
would
be
the
same
even
if
the
statute
were
not
in
the
case,
perhaps
somewhat
unlike
mr.
redding
and
it
seems
to
me
that
although
i
do
not
think
that
we
ought
to
take
part
in
a
discussion
of
whether
appeal
is
a
proper
remedy,
in
all
candor
it
seems
to
me
that
to
entertain
my
argument,
the
court
would
probably
have
to
grant
the
request
that
the
appeal
be
treated
as
a
request
for
certiorari
under
28
u.s.
code
1257.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
will
distinguish
a
little
later
between
a
--
i
suggest
a
possible
distinction
between
a
jewelry
store
and
a
restaurant
which
is
open
to
the
public
except
for
this
racial
discrimination,
but
except
for
that
point,
which
i
will
develop
a
little
later,
what
you
say
is
quite
right.
the
wilmington
parking
authority
is
admittedly
a
state
agency.
it's
also
common
ground,
as
i
read
the
opinion
below
and
the
briefs
in
this
case,
that
if
the
authority
operated
the
eagle
coffee
shop
on
these
premises,
any
discrimination
based
upon
race
or
color
would
violate
petitioner's
constitutional
rights.
consequently,
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
nullified
or
perhaps
i
should
say
"dropped
out
of
the
case"
because
the
state
has
leased
the
restaurant
to
a
private
enterprise
rather
than
operating
it
directly.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
put
the,
what
i
understand
to
be
the
holding
of
the
state
court,
just
a
little
bit
differently,
although
i
believe
you're
getting
at
the
same
point
that
i'm
about
to
make.
as
i
understand
the
court
below
and
the
respondents'
argument,
they
say
first,
that
eagle
is
not
a
state
agent
and
second,
that
eagle
is
not
performing
a
state
function.
that
is
to
say,
that
the
state
had
no
particular
interest,
so
far
as
the
evidence
shows,
one
way
or
the
other
in
whether
there
was
a
restaurant
there.
whereas
i
take
it
that
the
government
does
have
some
interest
in
its
public
building
in
there
being
eating
facilities
and
equally
has
some
interest
in
this
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
would
say
that
it's
a
state
function,
using
it
in
a
broad
sense,
not
in
the
sense
of
a
governmental
power.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
leased
space
in
a
building,
to
a
restauranteur
and
i
meant
to
refer
to
the
space,
rather
than
to
the
restaurant
company.
no,
there
was
no
interest.
i
think
we
must
concede,
on
the
state's
part
in
having
a
restaurant
and
we
do
concede,
first,
that
this
was
a
private
enterprise,
and
second,
that
the
state
had
no
particular
interest
in
there
being
eating
facilities.
nevertheless,
conceding
that
much,
we
think
that
the
conclusion
that
the
state
courts
drew
does
not
follow.
in
our
opinion
the
parking
authority
was
still
sufficiently
involved
to
say
that
the
discrimination
was
the
result
of
state
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
later
in
my
argument
i
will
detail
the
points
of
contact
or
involvement,
beginning
particularly
with
the
fact
that
this
was
a
state
owned
building.
it's
enough
i
think,
for
present
purposes
to
say
that
the
cumulative
effect
of
those
points
of
contact
or
participation
can
best
be
summarized
by
saying
that
the
state
is
operating
this
building,
in
the
words
of
the
delaware
supreme
court
in
an
earlier
case,
"as
a
single
self-sustaining
governmental
unit."
in
other
words,
it's
bound
together
and
it's
suffused
by
a
governmental
character
and
it
is
doing
that
without
according
its
citizens
equality
of
treatment.
i
would
like
first
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
general
standard
of
state
action
or
state
participation.
when
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
declared
that
no
state
shall
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process
of
law,
and
that
no
state
should
deny
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
they
prescribed
every
form
and
degree
of
state
activity.
legislative,
judicial,
or
executive
action
may,
of
course,
all
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
even
the
action
of
state
officials
acting
outside
the
scope
of
their
authority
may
violate
the
fourteenth
amendment.
if
discrimination
occurs
in
the
management
of
property
or
the
performance
of
either
proprietary
or
governmental
functions,
in
the
old
phrase,
again,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
called
into
play.
as
this
court
said
in
the
arkansas
school
case,
cooper
and
aaron,
for
the
purposes
of
applying
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
public
education,
there
is
state
action
where
there
is
state
participation
through
any
arrangement,
management,
funds,
or
property.
there
are
two
further
points
i
would
like
to
make
with
reference
to
the
test
of
state
participation.
one
i
think
really
goes
to
the
root
of
this
case.
it's
particularly
important
to
note
that
state
action
and
private
action
leading
to
racial
discrimination
should
not
be
viewed
as
if
they
were
mutually
exclusive
causes,
and
that
either
one
or
the
other
must
be
responsible,
but
not
both.
quite
the
contrary
i
think
is
true,
and
this
is
well
illustrated
by
the
present
case.
here
plainly
there
is
discrimination
by
a
private
person,
the
restaurant
and
we
don't
contend
that
that
is
the
action
of
a
state
agency,
but
the
fact
that
the
action
of
the
restaurant
is
one
cause
of
the
wrong
does
not
exculpate
the
state
if
the
state's
activities
are
also
a
substantial
contributing
factor.
the
court's
decisions
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
brought
into
play
when
the
discrimination
results,
as
it
does
here
we
think,
from
a
concurrence
of
state
and
private
activities.
and
the
other
point
that
i
would
want
to
emphasize
in
this
connection
is
that
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
decision
to
discriminate,
the
decision
to
discriminate
be
made
by
the
state.
shelley
and
kraemer
seems
to
me
to
illustrate
both
those
points.
the
racial
covenants
were
in
private
contracts.
the
discrimination
resulted
from
a
concurrence
of
the
private
contract
and
the
state
action.
in
the
girard
trust
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
it
was
court
action.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
--
i
suggest
that
the
point
still
is
that
it
took
the
concurrence
of
two
and
so
that
this
goes
back
to
my
earlier
point
that
private
action
and
state
action
what
may
be
concurrent
causes
and
the
state
still
responsible.
and
in
the
girard
trust
company,
the
initiation
of
this
discrimination
came
from
the
will
of
stephen
girard
and
the
state,
the
city
indeed,
acted
in
scarcely
more
than
a
ministerial
capacity.
in
both
cases
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
applied,
despite
the
concurrence
of
the
two
forms
of
action.
in
other
words,
we
think
that
state
action
implies
no
particular
formula.
if
the
wrong
is
done
solely
by
one
private
citizen
to
another
then
of
course
under
the
civil
rights
cases
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
come
into
play.
on
the
other
hand
if
the
activities
or
authority
of
the
state
cause
or
contribute
to
the
unjust
discrimination,
even
though
they're
not
the
sole
cause,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
violated
in
other
words,
the
question
is
one
of
judgment
and
degree
and
the
standard
is
a
pragmatic
one.
i
come
now
to
the
elements
of
state
participation
in
this
particular
case.
the
first
and
major
element
of
state
participation
is
its
ownership
of
the
property
on
which
the
discrimination
occurred.
this
was
property
held
by
the
authority
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people
of
delaware
equally.
yet
it's
used,
in
both
a
literal
and
a
legal
sense,
as
the
very
foundation
of
unequal
treatment.
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
means
anything
at
all,
surely
it
means
that
all
citizens
shall
stand
alike
in
their
relation
to
their
government,
regardless
of
race
or
color.
when
the
petitioners
went
on
o
property
held
by
their
government
for
public
purposes,
open
to
the
general
public,
they
were
denied
equal
treatment
solely
because
they
were
negroes.
no
one
looking
at
the
problem
with
any
human
understanding,
i
submit,
could
take
the
view
that
they
stood
before
the
state
of
delaware,
in
this
building
owned
by
the
state
of
delaware,
on
an
equal
plane
with
all
other
citizens.
and
i
think
it
is
also
fair
to
say
that
the
feelings
of
a
sensitive
man
discriminated
against
in
this
fashion
in
this
restaurant
would
be
quite
different
from
the
feelings
of
a
man
in
a
private
restaurant
on
property
which
is
entirely
privately
owned.
he
could
not,
in
other
words,
escape
the
fact
that
here
he
was
in
a
relation
to
his
government,
and
yet
was
denied
the
equality
of
treatment.
the
second
significant
point
of
state
contact
in
my
judgment
is
that
these
premises
are
physically
an
integral
part
of
a
building,
the
greater
part
of
which
is
currently
occupied
by
the
state
for
public
purposes.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
it
please
the
court?
towards
the
close
of
the
argument
on
tuesday,
i
was
beginning
to
develop
those
points
of
state
participation
or
contact
which
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
it
is
fair
to
describe
this
case
as
one
in
which
the
state
is
operating
a
single,
self-sustaining
governmental
unit
in
which
the
petitioners
were
denied
equality
of
treatment,
and
which
therefore
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
mentioned
as
the
first
of
those
factors,
the
circumstance
that
this
is
state-owned
land,
that
the
state
retains
a
connection
with
it
as
lessor,
and
indeed
we
think
that
that
would
be
ground
enough
to
invoke
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
second
significant
circumstance
is
that
these
leased
premises
are
physically
an
integral
part
of
the
building
which
is
currently
operated
by
the
state
and
currently
used
by
the
state
for
a
governmental
purpose.
this
circumstance
seems
to
me
to
distinguish
all
those
cases
where
you
have
an
isolated
piece
of
property
which
the
state
may
own
and
lease,
and
then
ceases
to
have
any
contact
with.
now
i'd
like
to
take
a
minute
to
describe
in
somewhat
more
detail,
since
the
court
below
said
it
could
take
judicial
notice
of
this
building,
just
what
the
physical
arrangements
are.
the
parking
facility
is
a
building.
it
occupies
all
of
one
block
on
the
street
which
it
fronts
principally,
and
it
reaches
back
a
good
two-thirds
of
the
normal
block
on
each
of
the
two
streets
running
at
right
angles.
on
the
front,
it
apparently
is
about
three
stories
high,
and
the
ground,
i
think,
slopes
down
behind.
so
there
are
about
three
stories
and
a
roof
available
for
parking.
on
the
front
of
the
building,
the
upper
portion
is
vertical
with
the
street;
that
is,
it
reaches
right
out
to
the
travel
portion
of
the
street
and
the
stores
which
are
along
the
front,
with
the
coffee
shop
right
in
the
middle,
are
recessed
back
in,
so
as
to
form
sort
of
an
arcade
over
the
sidewalk.
at
either
end
of
this
arcade,
anyone
walking
along
the
sidewalk
to
get
to
the
coffee
shop
would
see
immediately
over
him,
on
the
upper
part
of
the
building,
"wilmington
parking
authority,"
thus
emphasizing
that
the
whole
building
was
a
state
building
and
this
is
true
at
either
end.
then
on
the
front
of
the
building,
directly
over
the
coffee
shop
appears,
"mid-town
parking
center,"
identifying
this
facility
and
separating
it
out
from
what
i
understand
are
some
other
parking
lots
owned
by
the
wilmington
parking
authority.
on
the
front
of
the
building,
on
the
roof
over
the
coffee
shop,
are
two
flagpoles,
which
on
the
ordinary
days
of
the
week
fly
the
united
states
flag
and
the
flag
of
delaware.
i
emphasize
these
points
for
two
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it
does
seem
to
me
to
underscore
the
integrity,
the
unity,
of
this
building,
and
therefore
of
all
the
activities
which
take
place
in
it.
and
second,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
makes
very
plain
a
point
which
i
mentioned
tuesday,
towards
anyone
who
was
the
victim
of
discrimination
in
this
coffee
shop
could
not
escape
the
fact
that
the
discrimination
took
place
in
a
public
building
and
literally,
here,
under
the
flag
of
the
united
states
and
of
delaware,
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
just
wanted
to
say
i
thought
that
distinguished
this
case
from
many
others
which
might
be
put.
mr.
archibald
cox
none
that
i
know
of.
it
would
be
identified
only
by
the
physical
appearance,
but
i
think
--
i
do
want
to
say,
i
think
anyone
who
saw
this
would
realize,
as
i
certainly
did
when
i
went
to
see
it,
that
this
was
truly
part
of
one
building,
and
that,
while
the
architecture
is
quite
different,
it
was
in
a
public
building,
almost
as
obviously
as
in
the
restaurant
facilities
in
this
court
or
in
another
courthouse.
the
third
point
to
emphasize
is
that,
just
as
the
building
is
structurally
a
unit,
so
is
the
entire
enterprise
bound
up
financially
into
a
single
project.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware,
when
it
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
against
the
charge
that
this
was
leasing
for
a
private
commercial
purpose,
and
therefore
not
within
the
power
of
the
state,
ruled
that
the
leases
could
be
permitted
only
to
the
extent
that
such
leasing
is
necessary
and
feasible
to
enable
the
authority
to
finance
the
project.
in
other
words,
this
isn't
separate
or
surplus
or
extra
property,
of
the
kind
of
property
mentioned
in
derrington
and
plumber.
this
property
is
essential
to
the
conduct
of
this
state
enterprise.
the
fourth
thing
that
i
would
call
to
your
attention
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
isn't
the
view
that
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
took
of
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
an
exercise
of
financial
choice,
and
i
think
that
i
might
well
be
making
the
same
contention,
but
the
fact
that
this
is
bound
together
and
is
viewed,
whereas
this
would
not
have
been
permitted
by
delaware
had
it
been
leasing
of
a
separate
property
just
to
get
revenues,
whereas
it
was
regarded
that
it'd
be
essentially
by
the
state,
that
it
be
an
essential
part
of
one
single
enterprise,
does
seem
to
me
to
be
another
circumstance,
perhaps
not
an
essential
one,
binding
it
all
into
a
unit.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
quite
the
contrary
and
perhaps
i
should
say
now
something
that
applies
not
only
to
this
point,
but
to
a
number
of
distinctions
that
i
shall
draw,
that
i
think
in
this
field
it
is
important
to
consider
how
this
case
relates
to
others
that
it
suggests,
and
that
the
court
might
wish
to
satisfy
itself
that
there
were
administrable
and
rational
distinctions
between
this
case
and,
for
example,
justice
harlan's
suggestion
that
this
might
have
been
leased
for
a
private
park,
in
all
those
cases,
i
think
it
s
important
for
us
to
put
them
to
one
side.
it's
equally
important
not
to
prejudge
them.
in
this
field
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
really
can't
foretell
it's
complete
application,
or
even
entirely
know
our
own
meanings,
until
experience
and
time
have
given
us
a
greater
insight.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
three
other
points
deserve
somewhat
brief
mention.
the
first
is
that
this
property
was
acquired
by
a
state
agency
with
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
it
in
fact
was
all
negotiated
private
sale,
but
the
agency
did
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
and
it
seems
o
me
that
that
fact,
taken
with
the
financial
necessity
for
these
leases,
goes
far
to
destroy
the
argument
that's
presented
here
by
he
appellees
to
the
effect
that
this
is
extra
property
or
surplus
property.
indeed,
the
supreme
court
of
delaware,
in
passing
upon
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
said
of
these
leases,
or
one
of
these
leases,
“clearly
it
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
rule
permitting
temporary
commercial
leasing
of
public
facilities
not
immediately
needed
for
public
purposes”
and
then
went
on
and
said
that
this,
all
of
this
property,
was
being
used
for
public
purposes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
we'd
have
a
very
different
case.
what
i
said
to
justice
frankfurter
i
think
would
be
pertinent
here,
but
in
the
law
the
lessor
has
long
been
regarded,
as
the
court
knows,
as
having
a
continuing
relation
to
the
property
that
he
leases,
and
certain
responsibilities
in
connection
with
property
that
he
leases.
and
therefore
i
would
distinguish
this
case
from
all
those
cases
in
which
there
is,
if
i
may
be
colloquial,
a
one-shot
proposition.
the
state
sells
the
land,
the
state
grants
a
subsidy,
or
disposes
of
the
chattel.
here
there
is,
through
this
relation
of
lessor
and
lessee,
a
continuing
tie,
which
fits
in
with
these
other
bonds
that
i've
mentioned.
mr.
archibald
cox
you'd
have
the
same
physical
tie,
but
you'd
have
a
relationship
that
the
law
had
long
regarded
differently
and
it
might
be
thought
that
physical
tie
was
not
enough
to
impose
the
obligation
whereas
the
relationship
of
the
lessor,
who
had
convented
to
keep
part
of
this
premises
in
repair
is
one
which
frequently
carried
affirmative
duties
in
relation
to
the
land.
so
i
would
say
that
was
another
of
these
cases
which
can
be
logically
distinguished
in
that
we
shouldn't
undertake
to
decide
them
now
because
they
are
different
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
to
be
self-supporting,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
revenue
bonds,
these
bonds
from
which
these
premises
were
built
are
to
paid
only
out
of
the
revenues
from
the
profit.
mr.
archibald
cox
including
the
parking
charges
and
the
lease.
the
difficulty
which
the
state
faced
in
setting
this
up
was
that
to
finance
such
a
building
without
leasing
some
of
it
for
commercial
purposes,
would
have
required
parking
charges
so
large
couldn't
have
been
erected,
the
bonds
wouldn't
sell
as
revenue
bonds.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that
was
–
there
were
two
additional
points
of
public
involvement
that
i
was
going
to
mention.
one
is
the
fact
that
record
isn't
entirely
clear
but
at
least
a
$10,800,000
of
taxpayers'
money
went
into
this
building
and
the
second
point
is
that
this
building
is
wholly
tax
exempt.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
record,
according
to
my
best
recollection,
doesn't
show
mr.
justice
clark.
taking
these
facts
all
together
it
seems
to
us
that
two
conclusions
follow.
first,
that
this
project
is
bound
together
as
a
unit
so
that
each
part
of
it
is
colored
by
the
characteristics
of
the
other
part
and
the
second
that
the
hole
is
infused
with
a
public
or
governmental
quality.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
this
is
a
view
of
the
project,
curiously,
which
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
took
when
it
was
passing
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
the
challenge
to
the
statute
was
very
similar
to
the
argument
which
is
made
here,
to
wit,
that
these
would
be
private
commercial
leases
and
not
a
state
activity
and
the
argument
that
was
made
was
that
the
state
can't
go
into
the
business
of
leasing
its
property
for
private
commercial
purposes
because
this
would
enable
it
to
go
into
every
kind
of
private
enterprise.
the
supreme
court
of
delaware
rejected
that
argument,
using
the
phrase
that
i
have
quoted
so
often,
to
wit,
that
this
was
not
simply
an
ordinary
commercial
leasing,
but
that
it
was
a
single
self-sustaining
governmental
unit.
and
one
of
the
questions
that
was
put
to
the
court
was
whether
it
was
proper
to
grant
a
tax
exemption,
or
to
give
this
authority
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
and
the
court
answered
that
question
saying,
“since
we
have
held
the
purpose
of
the
project
as
a
whole
to
be
a
public
one,
the
answer
must
be
in
the
affirmative.”
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
in
a
footnote,
but
the
case
is
wilmington
parking
against
rankin.
it's
34
delaware
chancery,
page
439,
105
atlantic
second
614.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
two
observations.
the
first
is
that
when
the
framers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
sought
to
assure
equality
for
all
men
in
relation
to
the
state,
they
plainly
meant
a
state
in
all
its
activities
and
all
its
aspects.
similarly
this
court
has
never
been
grudging
in
its
interpretation
of
state
action.
it's
not
strained,
as
i
read
the
decisions,
for
fine
distinctions
concerning
the
degree
of
state
involvement
necessary
to
call
forth
the
guarantee
of
racial
equality.
quite
the
contrary,
it
has
struck
down
every
form
of
discrimination
that
affected
a
man
in
his
relation
to
his
government,
every
form
of
discrimination
between
the
citizen
and
his
government.
since
there
was
unquestionably
such
a
relation
here,
since
this
project
was
one,
and
a
project
where
the
petitioners
when
they
requested
service
in
this
restaurant,
could
not
help
knowing
that
they
were
on
the
property
of
the
state,
we
submit
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
called
into
play,
and
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
archibald
cox
there's
a
jewelry
shop
and
a
bookstore,
and
i
had
promised
to
comment
on
that
and
then
forgot
with
the
passage
of
time.
may
i
comment
on
that
somewhat
obliquely?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
central
fact
here
is
that
this
is
a
restaurant
open
to
the
general
public,
for
which
the
proprietor
has
shown
no
interest
in
the
selection
of
his
customers
except
for
this
bit
of
racial
discrimination.
that
kind
of
case
seems
to
me
to
stand
at
one
end
of
a
rather
broad
range.
at
the
other
end
would
go
a
lease
for
an
apartment
or
a
social
club,
possibly
a
lawyer's
office
or
a
doctor's
office,
of
state
property
in
this
building.
in
those
situations,
clearly
there
must
be
taken
into
account
the
interest
in
the
private
choice
of
friends,
associates,
possibly
of
his
clients.
now,
the
restaurant
is
a
place
of
public
accommodation,
in
the
nineteenth
century
language
of
william
sumner
and
others,
i'm
not
quite
clear
whether
the
jewelry
store
or
the
bookstore
belongs
in
the
first
category
or
in
the
same
category
as
a
restaurant.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
most
of
our
eyes
a
restaurant
has
a
somewhat
different
characteristic
from
other
shops
and
we
must
also
recognize
that
there
are
certainly
some
stores
which
do
make
a
choice
among
customers
on
non-invidious
grounds.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
may
be.
i
simply
say
that
we
don't
know
enough
about
them.
