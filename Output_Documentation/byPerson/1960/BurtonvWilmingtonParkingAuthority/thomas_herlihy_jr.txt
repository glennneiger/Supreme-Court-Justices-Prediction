mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
in
order
to
present
the
legal
argument
for
the
eagle,
it
is
necessary
that
i
implement
and
restate
certain
facts
which
have
already
been
made.
these
facts
are
essential
to
my
legal
argument.
the
eagle
was
incorporated
in
1934
and
has
conducted
a
restaurant
business
in
the
city
of
wilmington,
with
the
exception
of
few
months,
since
that
date.
now,
the
statute
creating
the
parking
authority
provides
power
to
lease
a
space
in
the
facility,
or
spaces.
the
leases
under
such
provision
fall
into,
and
under
the
statutory
provisions,
fall
into
two
categories,
where
the
lessee
may
carry
on
the
sale
of
gasoline
and
accessories,
and
provide
service
to
motorists,
that's
the
first
category,
as
the
statute
sets
it
out.
now,
the
second
is
where
the
lease
may
be
for
any
commercial
use
and
where
the
leasing
is
necessary
and
feasible
for
financing
the
operation
of
the
facility.
the
statute
provides
for
public
notice,
for
invitations
to
bid
for
leasing
space.
neither
the
legislative
act
nor
the
notice
for
the
bids
say
anything
as
to
what
use
is
to
be
made
of
the
space
leased;
nor
is
it
stated
anywhere
in
the
statute
or
the
bidding
proposal
procedure
that
the
space
was
to
be
leased
primarily
to
serve
patrons
of
the
parking
facility.
as
was
stated,
it's
by
mere
chance
that
the
space
was
awarded
to
a
restaurant.
it
could
have
been
awarded
to
any
other
type
of
business.
and
at
no
time,
either
in
the
legislative
history
or
bidding
or
negotiating
procedure
was
it
stated
that
the
authority
would
provide
a
restaurant
for
the
parking
facility
patrons.
the
eagle
lease,
as
well
as
the
leases
of
its
neighbors,
a
bookshop,
a
camera
shop,
a
retail
food
store,
and
a
jewelry
store
fall
into
this
category;
that
is,
the
second
category
of
commercial
leasing
as
provided
for
in
this
act.
the
main
and
only
public
entrance
to
the
eagle
and
these
stores
is
on
the
street
on
which
these
lessees
front.
there
are,
as
the
law
provides,
fire
exits.
now
the
street
on
which
these
stores
front,
is
basically
a
street,
where
shops
--
where
business
of
a
retail
nature
is
carried
on.
the
other
two
streets
that
are
referred
to
by
mr.
cox
are
basically
streets
with
the
rear
of
buildings
fronting
on
another
main
street,
where
they
have
other
retail
business
shops
and
i
pointed
that
out
so
that
the
court
would
have
that
picture,
that
these
are
ordinary
commercial
businesses.
the
eagle
was
awarded
the
space
it
occupied
because
it
submitted
a
successful
proposal
and
negotiated
for
the
space.
the
public
advertisement
for
the
bid
and
the
negotiations
for
this
space
put
no
restrictions
upon
the
eagle
as
to
the
patrons
it
would
serve.
the
authority
granted
the
eagle
a
lease
for
twenty
years,
and
this
lease,
as
well
as
all
other
documents,
puts
no
restriction
on
the
eagle
as
to
what
patrons
it
will
serve.
the
authority
at
no
time
has
made
a
statement
of
policy
in
this
respect,
nor
has
it
attempted
to
dictate
eagle's
policies.
as
was
stated,
the
eagle
through
its
own
capital
furnished
substantially
all
of
the
furnishings
and
fixtures,
including
the
air
conditioning,
to
enable
it
to
carry
on
the
business
of
a
restaurant,
cocktail
lounge,
and
banquet
rooms.
in
other
words,
the
eagle
leased
floor
space
and
bare
walls.
now,
considering
these
facts,
it
is
my
opinion
that
the
legal
issue
is,
whether
the
eagle
as
a
lessee
of
the
parking
authority,
performing
a
function
not
related
to
the
parking
services
of
the
facility,
has
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
position
is
that
it
has
not
been
--
that
there
has
not
been
a
violation
and
in
sustaining
our
position,
we
submit
a
two-fold
approach
which
is
in
the
alternative.
one,
there
was
no
state
action
in
this
case
because
eagle's
function
as
a
restaurant,
which
is
unrelated
to
the
function
of
the
parking
authority,
excludes
it
from
the
concept
of
state
action.
two,
if
it
is
established
that
there
was
state
action
in
this
case,
then
there
is
no
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
because
of
the
particular
factual
situation,
because
of
the
particular
factual
situation
of
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
first
proposition,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
integral
relationship
between
the
activities
of
eagle
and
activities
of
the
parking
authority.
the
respondent
eagle
contends
that
the
best
method
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
lessee
of
a
state
agency
is
part
of
state
action
is
to
analyze
the
functions
of
the
state
lessor
and
its
private
lessee
and
in
this
particular
phase
of
the
case,
legal
argument,
developing
what
may
be
considered
the
functional
answer
in
reply
to
the
statements
made
by
the
solicitor
general.
the
statute
creating
the
authority
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
authority
is
to
provide
off-street
parking
for
the
general
public.
this
legislative
act
further
provides
that
the
authority
may
enter
into
a
lease
when
the
lessee
may
carry
on
the
sale
of
gasoline,
motor
accessories,
and
services
and
again,
let
me
say
that
this
particular
service
would
be
part
of
the
function
of
the
parking
authority,
but
there
is
no
provision
which
directed
the
authority
to
provide
for
any
other
particular
service
for
its
parking
patrons,
and
there
is
nothing
which
states
that
it
would
provide
a
restaurant.
as
already
indicated,
it
happens
that
eagle
occupies
a
space
in
the
facility
not
because
it
serves
food
but
because
it
was
a
successful
bidder
for
that
space.
the
area
where
the
eagle
located
is
a
prime
area
for
a
restaurant
business,
which
was
the
situation
there
before
the
parking
authority
facility
was
constructed.
all
of
the
businesses
occupying
space
in
the
facility
including
the
restaurant,
front
as
i've
already
stated,
on
a
main
business
street.
there
is
no
public
entrance
from
the
parking
area
to
the
businesses.
the
bidding
and
negotiations,
of
course,
put
no
restrictions
on
the
eagle.
it
was
a
bona
fide
landlord-tenant
relationship.
the
lease
contains
no
provision
whereby
the
authority
would
be
able
to
control
the
policies
of
the
eagle
as
to
what
patrons
will
or
will
not
be
served.
nor
does
the
record
show
that
there
was
any
subterfuge
in
the
execution
of
this
lease
to
control
the
eagle's
customer
policies.
there
were
no
collusive
practices
here
in
order
to
carry
on
discriminatory
activities.
in
the
wilmington
area
there
is
an
atmosphere
of
racial
tolerance
and
the
motives
of
the
authority
and
the
eagle
were
to
enter
into
a
straight
landlord
and
tenant
relationship
without
any
attempt
to
circumvent
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
our
position
that
the
mere
fact
that
rental
income
from
the
eagle
is
necessary
to
finance
the
parking
facility
is
not
sufficient
to
bring
a
lessee
within
the
sphere
of
state
action.
to
say
that
it
is
a
controlling
factor
is
to
blow
up
that
fact
beyond
its
true
proportions
and
in
my
opinion,
to
torture
a
landlord-tenant
relationship
into
a
possible
principal-agent
relationship
when
the
principal
is
an
instrumentality
of
the
state,
by
making;
the
tenant
an
agent
because
the
rental
income
there
from
is
necessary
for
the
landlord's
continuance,
is
an
arbitrary
breakdown
of
legal
relationships.
in
the
derrington
case
there
was
a
bona
fide
lease,
but
the
function
of
the
lessee
was
to
cater
to
the
patrons
of
the
courthouse
and
that
part
of
the
courthouse
which
the
restaurant
occupied
was
planned,
equipped,
and
furnished
by
the
county.
the
space
that
the
eagle
occupies
in
this
facility
was
neither
planned
equipped
or
furnished
by
the
parking
authority
as
a
restaurant.
to
state
that
rental
income
alone
is
the
determining
factor
will
lead
to
the
clear
conclusion
that
every
necessary
business
transaction
between
the
state
and
any
private
business
which
furnishes
income
or
service
to
the
state
would
immediately
bring
the
private
business
involved
within
the
scope
of
state
action.
let
me
take
several
examples.
suppose
that
a
cpa
firm
is
called
upon
to
audit
the
accounts
of
the
parking
authority.
this
cpa
firm
comes
on
the
premises.
it
begins
its
audit.
it's
a
known
fact
that
it's
auditing
the
books
and
this
firm
has
a
record
of
discrimination,
engaging
in
racial
discrimination.
now,
obviously
its
participating,
it's
providing
services
to
the
state.
is
the
court
going
to
say
that
this
state
action
theory
will
reach
out
and
say
to
that
auditing
firm,
you
are
engaged
in
the
discriminatory
practices,
you
cannot
carry
on
this
work
on
the
parking
facility?
now
let's
take
for
example,
suppose
that
they
have
a
breakdown
in
the
plumbing
system
and
the
plumber
comes
along
and
he
puts
up
his
sign
that
he's
doing
the
plumbing
work
there.
he
is
rendering
services
to
the
state
and
they
find
that
the
plumber
was
engaged
in
discriminatory
practices,
is
the
arm
of
the
state
to
reach
out
and
say,
no
you
can't
do
this
work
with
the
parking
authority
because
you
engage
in
discriminatory
practices?
in
other
words,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
to
rest
this
case
on
rental
income
is
to
lead
to
such
absurdities
as
i
just
indicated
and
furthermore,
suppose
you
had
an
instrumentality
of
the
state
which
took
some
funds
put
it
in
a
certificate
of
deposit
in
a
bank,
and
drew
income,
interest
income
from
that,
is
that
very
fact
alone
to
say,
well,
this
now
makes
that
bank
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
i
say
to
that
argument
that
you
cannot
just
state
or
take
as
the
–
as
he
attempted
to
do
to
make
the
physical
unit
as
one
as
seemingly
appeared
from
the
mere
description
and
which
i
disagree
with.
i
say
they're
not
basically
one.
there
is
only
--
the
only
physical
connection,
if
i
understand
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
only
physical
connection
is
the
fact
that
there's
the
exit,
the
fire
exit,
into
the
authority's
building,
but
the
customers
come
off
of
ninth
street.
they
know
this
is
business.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
as
i
take
his
argument,
he's
basing
it
solely
from
the
point
of
view
that
it's
supplying
rental
income
and
rental
income
is
part
of
the
plan
devised
by
the
state
to
sustain
this
building,
if
i
understand
your
question
--
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
i
would
not
go
that
far
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
they
should
assume
--
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
my
answer
would
be
that
the
circumstances
--
certainly
the
individuals,
i
think
the
individual
here
would
be
aware
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
private
enterprise.
i
have
grave
doubt
an
individual
going
into
any
of
these
shops
would
think
that
he
was
dealing
with
some
instrumentality
of
the
state
of
delaware,
just
because
it's
in
the
building.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
i
don't
go
quite
that
far,
because
i
say
--
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
from
the
point
of
view,
i
say
there
are
two
ways
of
approaching
this
matter.
he
bases
his
argument,
the
solicitor
general
bases
his
argument
on
what
is
considered
more
or
less,
if
i
may
state
it,
the
functional
theory.
that
is,
we
look
at
the
functions.
the
function
of
the
eagle,
according
to
the
solicitor
general,
was
to
provide
income
to
the
parking
authority
so
that
it
could
carry
on
its
enterprise.
i
say
you
would
have
to
break
down
the
functions
of
the
government
lessor
and
the
function
of
the
private
lessee.
i
think
you
have
to
separate
them.
that's
where
i
take
issue
with
it,
and
i
had
planned
to
just
develop
that
right
now,
if
you'll
permit
me
to.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
boynton
case
is
well
put
and
i
think
that
when
you
analyze
the
facts
of
the
boynton
case
i
think
that
you
can
see
that
what
i'm
trying
to
reach
here
is
applicable.
now
in
the
boynton
case
the
court
cut
through
all
the
legal
relationships.
it
ignored
the
fact
that
there
was
an
attempt
just
to
overcome
the
restaurant-keepers'
nonlease
situation.
it
went
back
and
stated;
one,
there
was
an
agreement
between
the
trailways,
the
transit
company
or
the
carrier,
and
the
terminal
people.
the
restaurant,
the
keeper
in
that
particular
instance
had
no
connection
by
lease
or
otherwise,
with
the
facility,
that
is,
the
bus
terminal
and
what
the
court
did,
the
court
looked
at
the
function
of
the
lessee,
if
i
may
make
my
point
now,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
looked
at
the
function
of
the
lessee,
and
it
saw
that
the
function
of
the
lessee
was
to
serve
those
persons
who
were
in
travel
in
transit.
now,
we
look
at
the
function
of
the
eagle
in
this
situation
and
ask
ourselves,
what
is
the
function
of
the
lessee
in
this
case?
the
function
of
the
lessee
is
to
serve
the
general
public,
not
just
merely
the
patrons
of
the
parking
authority,
but
to
serve
the
general
public.
and
when
you
follow
this
functional
theory
to
its
natural
conclusion,
you
can
see
very
well,
and
to
point
this
out
i'd
like
to
give
you
just
a
few
of
the
tests
that
i
would
examine
these
situations
on
and
i'm
sure
the
court
must
have
examined
them
when
they
considered
the
boynton
case.
i
ask
myself,
in
the
analysis
of
these
cases,
in
determining
to
see
whether
or
not
there
were
any
standards
by
which
you
could
evaluate
these
cases?
was
there
a
bona
fide
transaction
as
a
result
of
arm's-length
negotiation?
that
was
the
first
one.
then
i
took,
was
there
any
evidence
of
subterfuge
in
order
to
evade
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
and
the
third
thing,
is
the
lessee
an
integral
part
of
the
functions
of
the
governmental
lessor
and
fourth
-
is
there
any
statutory
or
administrative
control
of
the
lessee?
and
when
i
applied
these
standards
to
this
situation,
it
was
my
opinion
that
the
eagle
should
not
be
brought
within
the
orbit
of
state
action.
now,
if
you
take
this
case
and
the
boynton
case,
you'll
see
very
well
that
it
was
rightly
brought
within
the
sphere
of
state
action.
in
furtherance
of
our
contention
that
there
was
no
state
action
here,
we
should
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
prior
definitions
of
state
action
should
be
re-examined.
some
modification
0f
the
approach
to
the
solution
of
situation
similar
to
our
present
case
may
be
necessary.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
have
a
statement
here
i'd
like
to
read,
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
made
in
the
gomillion
case,
“particularly
in
dealing
with
claims
under
broad
provisions
of
the
constitution
which
derive
content
by
an
interpretative
process
of
inclusion
and
exclusion,
it
is
imperative
that
generalizations
based
on
and
qualified
by
concrete
situations
which
gave
rise
to
them
must
not
be
applied
out
of
context,
in
disregard
of
the
variant
controlling
facts.”
and
i
say,
your
honors,
that
there
are
variant
controlling
facts
in
this
case
which
should
be
examined
in
this
particular
situation.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
i
think
that
it
is
germane,
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
taken
into
account
and
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
like
to
also
state
that
in
the
course
and
i
will
develop
it
right
now
--
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
i
take
it
into
account
in
this
way.
of
course,
there
the
private
trust
was
administered
by
the
board
of
city
trustees
of
philadelphia.
the
court
stated
that
was
improper
because
of
the
fact
that
mr.
girard
in
his
will
had
provided
only
for
the
education
of
white
male
children.
they
removed
the
--
the
court
stated
that
that
was
improper
and
that
that
was
an
exertion
of
a
state
power
and
when
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
lower
court,
they
were
removed.
now
then,
what
happened?
the
orphan's
court
in
philadelphia
turned
around
and
then
appointed
private
trustees
and
there
that
was
held
to
be
a
proper,
although
i
say
that
was
basically
an
exertion
of
state
power,
yet
in
that
particular
instance,
when
it
remanded
back
to
the
orphan's
court
in
philadelphia,
they
turned
around
and
substitute
private
trustees
for
public
trustees
and
then
subsequently
the
supreme
court
in
philadelphia
held
that
that
was
not
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
so
i
say
that
basically
that
was
an
exertion
when
they
got
back
to
private
trustees.
then
you
had
a
matter
of
a
private
business
and
i
state
that
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
really
--
to
challenge
the
holding,
in
one
respect,
but
by
the
same
time
and
i
cite
in
my
brief
the
girard
trust
company
case
to
show
you
that,
in
examining
this
whole
principle
of
the
matter
of
the
exertion
of
state
power,
you've
got
to
look
at
all
aspects
of
it.
with
that
principle
in
mind,
let
us
review
the
cases.
usually
the
state
action
has
been
broadly
and
generally
defined
as
an
exertion
of
state
power.
this
definition
has
been
paraphrased
to
mean
a
touch
of
the
government's
thumb
on
the
scale.
now,
i
develop
from
that
to
berman
versus
parker,
in
which
the
court
held
that
private
property
could
be
taken
and
then
resold
for
a
public
purpose
to
private
individuals
and
that's
the
starting
point.
now,
in
the
dorsey
case,
which
was
a
situation
where
the
property
was
taken
by
a
governmental
agency,
resold
to
a
private
developer
who
practiced
a
discriminatory
practices.
now,
these
are
designated
as
the
blighted
area
cases.
now,
they
certainly
indicate
the
power
of
the
government
was
used
to
acquire
a
blighted
area,
clear
the
site,
and
then
negotiate
a
resale
of
the
land
to
private
redevelopers.
in
this
process
of
governmental
action,
it
no
doubt
happened
that
the
homes
of
negroes
were
taken,
as
in
the
dorsey
case,
which
was
a
discrimination
against
negroes
by
private
developers.
yet,
the
court
was
not
concerned
with
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
was
obvious
that,
in
the
berman
and
dorsey
cases,
there
was
an
exertion
of
state
power.
now,
in
the
derrington,
the
derrington
and
ashwander
cases,
now
the
derrington
case,
of
course,
is
the
courthouse
space
where
the
space
in
the
courthouse
was
leased,
and
the
ashwander
case
was
where
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
right
of
the
tva
to
sell
surplus
electricity
or
to
lease
surplus
electricity
to
private
individuals.
now,
these
cases
are
labeled
by
us
as
the
surplus
property
cases
in
our
brief,
and
in
developing
this,
i
say
that
i
am
not
drawing
a
direct
analogy
between
the
surplus
cases
or
do
i
want
to
be
taken
as
to
say
that
this
extra
space
that
was
set
up
in
the
eagle
for
business
purposes
is
to
be
considered
surplus.
i'm
only
trying
to
show
to
what
extent
the
exertion
of
state
power
has
gone
without
being
considered
as
being
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
these
cases
indicate
that
once
surplus
property
is
leased,
the
lessee
is
free
to
deal
with
its
property
almost
without
any
possibility
of
being
charged
with
a
fourteenth
amendment
violation.
and
i
argue
by
analogy
that
here
we
have
a
private
lessee
now
in
charge
of
the
space
that
has
been
leased
to
it
by
the
lessor,
the
governmental
lessor,
it
is
now
in
the
category
of
a
private
lessee
and
has
the
right
to
enjoy
all
the
privileges
of
a
private
lessee.
just
to
show
you
to
what
extent,
in
trying
to
determine
the
boundaries
of
what
is
meant
by
an
exertion
of
state
power,
look
at
the
licensing
cases,
where
there
has
obviously
been
an
exertion
of
state
power
in
granting
an
individual
the
right
to
carry
on
a
business.
and
in
many
instances
the
licensing
may
be
in
a
discriminatory
practice
--
the
licensee
may
engage
in
discriminatory
practices.
for
example,
we
have
a
theater
in
wilmington
called
the
ri-llto
theatre.
now,
the
state
granted
to
that
theater
the
license
to
carry
on
a
theater.
it
censors
the
films
that
go
on
in
that
--
are
carried
on
in
that
theater.
obviously,
in
my
opinion
that
s
an
exertion
of
state
power
and
yet,
that
theater
engages
in
discnminatory
practices.
so
i
state
that
--
also
i've
now
covered
the
girard
trust
use,
but
i
would
like
to
restate
that
certainly
the
acts
of
the
orphan
s
court
in
removing
the
public
trustees
and
substituting
private
trustees
was
an
exercise
of
governmental
power.
and
yet,
that
act,
or
that
substitution
was
not
considered
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
there
would
be
at
least,
broadly
twenty
to
thirty
at
least,
as
a
minimum.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
for
example,
the
lawyers,
and
of
course
the
doctors
and
the
optometrists
and
the
opticians,
and
similar
professional
groups
of
that
type
and
there
are
some
established
restaurants
get
a
license
and
a
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
license
too,
plumbers,
and
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
electricians
and
--
there's
a
question
about
barbers
at
the
time.
they
do
have
to
get
a
license,
but
whether
they
have
to
be
examined
for
that
license
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
of
the
movies.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
weil,
censorship
is
part
of
the
general
law.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
i
think
mr.
killoran
is
correct,
that
that's
a
standard
phrase
in
most
commercial
leases.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
and
it's
a
standard
phrase
in
commercial
leases
where
there's
no
possibility
of
it
being
considered
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it's
between
two
private
parties.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
correct.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
i'm
only
showing
the
distinction
to
this
extent
that
to
state
that
i
think
we
have
to
re-examine
the
general
concept
of
state
--
the
exertion
of
state
power
or
state
action
to
determine
just
how
far
we
want
to
go
in
determining
what
is
state
action.
now,
i
cited
the
movie
case.
i
cited
the
situation
regarding
the
occupations.
that
is
state
action,
and
yet
there
was
no
attempt
to
bring
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
say
that
what
we
have
to
determine
is
to
say,
well,
where
are
we
going
to
go
in
this
matter
of
saying
this
is
or
this
is
not
state
action
for
determining
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
first
of
all
that
we
have
to
start
back
with
the
ashwander
case
and
the
derrington
case.
i
think
we
have
to
consider
the
matter
of
the,
i
think
i
gave
the
berman
versus
parker
and
those
cases
to
see
that
their
exercise
--
and
the
dorsey
case.
i
don't
think
the
dorsey
case,
i
don't
recall
whether
that
got
into
court
or
not,
but
the
dorsey
case
certainly
has
to
be
examined
because
right
there
is
where
there
was
an
exercise
of
state
power
by
the
state
of
new
york.
it
acquired
the
land
and
sold
it
to
the
stuyvesant
corporation,
who
turned
around
and
practiced
racial
discrimination.
now,
i
say
that
that
in
itself
demonstrates
that
in
one
instance
the
court
will
say,
all
right,
that
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
in
other
instances
it
will.
now,
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
determining
factor,
and
i
think
that
when
a
business
is
basically
a
private
business
and
can
he
put
in
that
category,
as
i
feel
the
eagle
should,
then
i
think
that
we
have
to
state
that
we
cannot
interfere
in
that
type
of
business.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
it
did
not,
no.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes,
but
i
say
--
i
start
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
preface
my
remarks.
i
start
somewhere
in
building
first
of
all
the
fact
that
we
take
this
situation.
that
case
did
state
that
the
government
could
take
and
i
must
state
it's
by
dictum,
that
the
government
could
take
its
property
and
sell
it
to
a
private
individual.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
i
made
the
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
i
started
with
a
general
proposition
and
i
moved
on
from
the
ashwander
case
to
the
derrington
case
where
again
had
a
matter
of
what
they
called
surplus
property
and
i
said
i
was
not
trying
to
draw
an
exact
analogy
between
the
excess
property
in
the
derhngton
case
with
this
situation
in
our
case.
but
i
move
on
that
there
they
could
—
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
i
start
with
private
--
there
is
a
right
to
deal
with
private
enterprise.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes,
but
i'm
saying
that
there
was
an
exertion
of
state
power,
and
when
the
private
lessee
as
a
result
of,
maybe,
using
his
electricity,
was
discriminated
in
any
way,
there
is
no
question
that
that
private
lessee
has
a
right
to
discriminate.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
i'll
just
--
not
to
repeat
my
position,
just
let
me
say
once
again,
however
i
am
not
using
it
for
that
particular
point
and
as
you
just
state,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
you
and
i
disagree
on
the
starting
point,
but
i
in
dealing
with
private
property
we
have
to
start
somewhere,
and
i
start
with
the
ashwander
case
then
i
go
to
the
derrington
case.
then
i
take
and
move
onto
what
i
call
the
blighted
property
area
cases,
that
is
the
dorsey
case
and
the
parker
versus
berman,
and
i
come
down
than
and
state,
well
what
does
this
all
add
up
to
and
as
i
have
already
indicated
it,
and
you
may
say,
well
where
is
this
analysis
getting
us
and
that's
where
you
came
in
on
me
with
this
question.
well,
even
though
the
decision
in
the
boynton
case,
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
clark,
is
not
entirely
in
our
favor.
i
do
think
that
you
do
have
to
take
the
--
and
use
the
analysis
of
the
boynton
case,
the
court
in
that
case,
and
try
to
--
let's
look
at
the
relationship
of
the
parties
and
see
what
functions
that
they
perform
and
that
basically
is
what
i
designate
as
the
functional
theory
of
my
case.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
now
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
you
see,
the
only
tax
that
there
is
that
would
be
applicable
apart
from
any
licensing,
if
a
license
were
considered
a
tax,
would
be
a
real
estate
tax.
there
is
no
other
tax
except
income
and
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
the
property
as
such,
in
the
nature
of
a
real
estate
tax?
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
presumably
there
can
be
a
personal
tax,
but
there
is
no
personal
tax,
as
far
as
such,
in
delaware
or
in
new
castle
county.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
no,
there
was
220,000
dollars
spent
on
equipment.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
220,000.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
as
a
personal
property
tax,
no,
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
no,
sir.
if
this
were
in
a
private
--
used
by
a
private
corporation
in
a
private
establishment?
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
there
would
be
no
tax.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
there
is
no
personal
property
tax.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
i
understand
your
question,
i
didn't
comprehend
it.
if
the
improvements
on
the
premises
can
be
considered
in
nature
as
becoming
a
part
of
the
really
--
realty
then
they
would
be
taxed
as
real
estate.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right,
but
i
would
state
that
in
most
instances,
if
my
reading
of
the
lease
is
correct,
that
these
particular
fixtures
and
equipment
the
eagle
may
withdraw,
provided
of
course
they
put
the
premises
back
in
the
condition
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
leasing.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes,
if
it
were
considered
as
part
of
the
real
estate.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
now
except
it
may
be
that,
taking
the
matter
to
the
tax
authorities
and
arguing
that
that
is
not
an
improvement
of
the
realty
as
such,
but
is
part
of
a
leasehold
interest,
we
may
be
in
a
position
to
justify
and
avoid
a
matter
of
taxation
in
that
instance
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
--
and
that
must
be
considered.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
in
my
understanding
we
have
the
right
to
remove
fixtures.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
mr.
killoran
informs
me
it
only
goes
so
far
as
fixtures
and
not
those
that
would
become
part
of
the
building.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
that
what
we've
got
to
look
at
in
light
of
your
own
statement
is
to
make
sure
that
we
examine
the
variants
in
each
case.
now,
in
your
particular
case
i
would
say
that
the
court,
if
it
takes
the
position
that
if
i
give
an
exemption,
an
outright
exemption
to
a
particular
business
that
may
amount
to
state
action.
it
certainly
is
state
action
--
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
no.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
because
i
want
to
make,
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
–
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
oh,
yes
indeed.
but
let
me
say
this
--
if
i
may
take
that
point,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
use
it
insofar
as
mr.
justice
black
is
concerned
i
would
say
this
that
if
you
have
a
business
that
has
been
induced
to
come
into
a
community
and
it's
held
out
to
them
that,
here,
you
come
in
here
and
we'll
permit
you
to
be
tax
exempt
for
five
to
ten
years
or
whatever
it
may
be.
to
me
that's
an
exertion
of
state
power
and
in
the
definitions,
it's
the
thumb
on
the
scale.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well
no,
but
what
i'm
coming
about
to,
i'm
going
to
bring
it
back
to
my
particular
position,
in
this
respect.
now,
it
may
be
necessary
for
that
community
to
do
just
that
to
induce
that
business
to
come
there,
so
that
the
general
welfare
of
the
community
is
as
necessary.
what
i'm
pointing
out
is
this,
that
in
these
cases
we
have
got
to
consider
the
general
welfare
of
the
entire
community.
all
right,
a
particular
group
may
suffer
as
a
result
of
this
taking
or
this
exertion
of
state
power,
as
the
case
may
be,
but
by
and
large
the
downtown
business
area
is
saved,
the
community
is
saved
from
the
usual
decadence
that
goes
with
downtown
business
areas.
it's
improved.
it
means
that
the
general
welfare
is
in
a
much
better
position
as
a
result
of
that
and
just
before
i
close,
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
one
matter.
this
case
started
in
equity.
it's
a
chancery
proceeding
and
i
want
to
say
this,
that
in
the
jones
versus
marva
case,
marva
theater
case,
the
court
considered
an
angle
which
i
think
merits
attention.
in
that
case
the
court
stated,
“let's
balance
the
equities
in
this
situation.”
now,
marva
theaters
in
that
particular
situation
had
expended
a
lot
of
money
in
the
theater.
they
stated
they
tried
to
work
out
some
arrangement
through
his
actions
they
weren't
able
to
complete
what
was
the
suggested
procedure.
now,
here
is
eagle.
it
expended
a
lot
of
money.
the
record
shows
that
back
in
1957
the
class
of
which
the
plaintiff,
the
appellant
in
this
case,
is
a
part,
could
have
very
well
come
in
and
asked
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
had
this
matter
stated.
but
no,
this
matter
goes
on
for
all
these
years,
and
suddenly
we're
met,
after
the
eagle
has
been
in
business
for
a
period
of
time.
i
think
that
that's
inherent
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
it's
inherent
in
any
court
of
equity
to
consider
and
balance
these
equities.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
i
don't
go
that
far,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
i
say
that
when
they
know
about
it
and
they
do
come
in
and
ask
about
it,
as
they
did
in
this
case,
it's
in
the
record.
they
did
in
1957,
although
the
contract
had
been
let
at
that
time
--
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
when
i
say
that
this
was
a
class,
a
member
of
this
class,
the
same
class
to
which
the
appellant
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
they
came
in
in
the
1957
and
said
to
the
president
of
the
parking
authority,
put
a
policy
in
effect
on
eagle,
in
the
eagle
restaurant,
which
will
be
against
discrimination.
and
nothing
was
done,
nothing
went
beyond
the
grievance.
the
answer
of
the
president
of
the
parking
authority
at
that
point
was,
the
contract
has
already
been
let
and
there's
no
doubt
that
that
would
and
it
did
happen.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
saying
to
that
extent,
your
honor.
but
i'm
saying
that
there's
a
time
when
you
got
–
where
we
have
we
start
off,
as
i
contend
in
this
case,
that
we
do
have
a
private
business
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
basis
to
show
that
there
is
a
private
business
here
and
if
we
do
have
that,
then
i
think
we
ought
to
evaluate
the
equities
of
the
situation.
now,
if
the
eagle
had
been
part
and
parcel
of
a
scheme
to
defeat
the
ends
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
would
look
at
it
differently.
now,
at
no
time
did
the
eagle
make
any
pronouncement
which
in
any
way
would
consider
that
the
people
of
the
colored
race
were
offensive
to
it.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
offensive
to
it.
it
just
made
a
categorical
statement,
as
is
in
the
answer.
they
refused
to
serve
them.
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
they
didn't
just
come
out
and
state
that
the
whole
class
was
offensive
as
such.
they
said
they
refused
to
sell
to
a
person
of
the
colored
race.
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
a
great
deal
was
made
here
yesterday
of
the
fact
that
the
colored
race
was
obnoxiously,
as
a
matter
of
general
knowledge,
that
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of,
was
obnoxiously
offensive
to
the
parking
authority.
we
do
not
go
along
with
that.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
yes,
in
the
particular
situation.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
we
did,
but
we
didn't
go
to
the
extent
of
saying
that
the
whole
race
was.
we
said
this
particular
plaintiff,
this
particular
petitioner.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
we
did.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
we
did.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
well,
we
did
but
it
may
have
been
on
this
particular
as
a
member
of
that
race,
but
we
didn't
say
that
they
were
obnoxiously
offensive,
and
that's
the
point
i
wanted
to
make.
we
did
discriminate
against
this
particular
individual
because
of
his
race.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
it's
a
private
business.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
it
could
very
well
--
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
it
could
very
well,
because
what
happens
in
many
government
contracts
mr.
justice
black
is
there
are
specific
provisions
written
right
into
the
contract.
and
i
brought
along
that,
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
quote
that
to
you,
but
in
many
government
enterprises
it's
specifically
stated
that
there
shall
be
no
discrimination
and
that
would
solve
the
question
right
here.
if
that
had
been
in
this
lease,
none
of
us
would
be
here.
mr.
thomas
herlihy,
jr.
they
could
have
done
it.
