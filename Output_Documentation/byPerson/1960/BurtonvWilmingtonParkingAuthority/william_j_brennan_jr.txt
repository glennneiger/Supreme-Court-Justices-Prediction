(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

we
should
take
it
then
that
the
delaware
courts
interpreting
this
statute
as
a
defense,
merely
on
the
ground
of
color?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
case
is
before
us
on
that
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
relying
on
this
statute
alone,
or
rather
the
reliance
of
the
defendants
on
this
statute
alone,
for
your
state
action
point?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
you're
not
suggesting
that
where
this
a
private
restaurant,
unrelated
to
the
parking
authority.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
supposed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
in
the
context
of
a
restaurant
in
a
building
built
with
the
public
funds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might
make
the
same
argument
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
department
store
where
there
had
been
an
exclusion
from
a
restaurant
and
reliance
on
this
statute,
but
that's
not
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
redding,
are
some
of
these
other
--
there
are
other
commercial
leases,
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
for,
(inaudible)
stores
and
that
sort
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
take
the
jewelry
store.
suppose
there
had
been
a
refusal
to
accept
the
trade
of
a
negro
solely
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
negro.
the
statute
which
was
relied
upon
as
a
defense
here,
1501,
wouldn't
apply,
but
would
you
be
here
on
such
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
wouldn't
be
here
talking
about
1501
because
that
does
not
give
a
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
not
be
a
defense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
1
gather,
mr.
solicitor
general,
this
would
