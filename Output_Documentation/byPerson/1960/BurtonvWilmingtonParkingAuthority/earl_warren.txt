chief
justice
earl
warren
william
h.
burton,
appellant
versus
wilmington
parking
authority,
et
al.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
wasn't
entirely
financed
by
revenue
bonds,
was
it?
there
was
no
public
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
killoran?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
it
control
over
whether
it
remains
a
restaurant
or
goes
into
the
shoe
business,
for
instance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
lease
having
to
do
with
segregation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
consider
that
those
laws
would
not
be
binding
on
the
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
you
had
entered
into
a
lease
with
these
people
to
the
effect
that
they
could
not
segregate.
do
you
have
that
power?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
the
authority,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
if
you
had
that
power,
and
there's
nothing
said
in
the
lease
about
discrimination,
what
is
the
interest
of
the
authority
in
trying
to
sustain
this
judgment
which
does
discriminate
against
american
citizens?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
that
the
authority
intended
that
there
should
be
segregation
--
that
segregation
should
be
permitted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
am
still
wondering,
i'm
still
wondering
what
the
concern
of
--
if
this
is
private
enterprise,
and
it
is
between
these
lessees
and
these
people
who
claim
to
have
been
excluded,
why
is
that
a
matter
of
such
great
concern
to
the
authority?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
contract
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
segregation,
you
just
said
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
ask
you
this?
suppose
one
of
these
petitioners
here
owned
a
portion
of
that
property
as
his
home,
and
it
was
condemned
from
him,
taken
away
from
him
by
power
of
eminent
domain
and
then
you
built
this
establishment
on
there.
you
believe
that
it's
a
duty
of
the
authority
to
maintain
the
position
which
would
exclude
that
man
from
equal
treatment
in
that
property?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
these
parking
facilities
are
very
often
developed
in
places
where
the
buildings
are
substandard
and
where
they
want
to
get
rid
of
the
buildings
and
make
a
better
use
of
the
property
and
it's
not
at
all
uncommon
to
dispossess
these
very
kind
of
people
in
order
to
have
a
public
facility
of
that
kind
and
where
that
is
the
situation
i'm
still
wondering
why
the
authority
feels
it
incumbent
on
them
to
take
the
position
that
these
people
have
the
right
to
segregate
when
it's
their
problem
and
not
the
part
of
the
authority.
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
you
condemn
property
in
delaware
for
other
than
a
public
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
considered
a
public
use.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
now
if
you
had
to
condemn
this
property
only
for
a
public
use,
how
can
you
disassociate
the
state
entirely
from
it
by
saying
the
use
they're
going
to
put
it
to
is
a
private
use,
and
not
a
public
use?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
you
have
condemned
this
entire
piece
of
property
for
restaurants
and
the
other
lines
of
business
that
are
lessees
in
this
building
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
that
isn't
the
question
i
asked.
i
asked
if
you
could
have
condemned
this
entire
piece
of
property
just
for
restaurants
and
jewelry
stores
and
things
of
that
kind.
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
then,
if
you
could
not,
does
it
not
become
--
when
you
do
it,
does
it
not
become
an
inseparable
part
of
that
which
is
a
public
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
mean
that
the
state
in
order
to
finance
a
public
project,
can
independently
go
into
private
enterprise
and
condemn
property
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
had
to
be
condemned
only
for
a
public
use,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
for
a
public
purpose.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
it
go
beyond
the
public
purpose
or
can
it
merely
engage
in
collateral
activities
that
will
make
the
public
purpose
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
whatever
--
but
whatever
the
government
did
construct,
it
constructed
with
public
money,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
is
the
amount
of
money
that
the
city
itself
put
into
it
to
be
returned
to
it
through
the
bond
issue?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
to
that
extent
these
people
and
all
other
people
in
the
community
had
contributed
their
tax
moneys
to
that
building,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
believe
that,
even
though
they
have,
that
it
can
be
--
you
should
be
able
to
so
administer
it
as
to
discriminate
against
those
who
have
contributed
through
their
tax
monies?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think
that's
contested
in
here,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
when
they
paid
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
mean
they
could
have
refused
to
pay
their
taxes
and
said
we
won't
do
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
doesn't
even
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
a
strategem
or
not,
as
between
the
authority
and
the
lessee
if
the
authority
takes
the
position
that
it's
honor-bound
to
come
into
this
court
and
support
this
policy
of
discrimination?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that's
all
you're
doing,
is
just
stating
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
--
are
you
urging
us
to
sustain
this
judgment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
position
is
neutral?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
didn't
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
herlihy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
distinguishing
your
theater
case
a
moment
ago,
you
said
the
state
retained
some
control
over
them
because
of
censorship
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
the
moving
pictures.
now,
was
that
a
part
of
the
lease
or
was
that
a
--
they
just
censored
them
as
they
were
subject
to
it
because
censorship
was
a
part
of
your
general
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
well,
don't
you
have
the
same
thing
in
this
case?
we've
got
a
provision
in
this
case
that
says
they
must
obey
all
laws,
which
would
include
laws
of
that
character.
they'd
be
police
laws.
that's
exactly
what
counsel
said
a
little
while
ago.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
only
point
i
was
making
was,
i
thought
you
distinguished
the
theater
case
from
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
in
that
case
the
state
retains
supervision
over
an
administrative
power
over
them
because
of
the
censorship
statute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
was
not
incorporated
in
the
lease,
except
to
something
of
this
kind.
now,
you
have
the
same
thing
in
this
case.
you
have
the
same
provision,
and
they
have
to
obey
the
health
laws
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
have
to
obey
the
liquor
laws.
they
have
to
obey
all
kinds
of
laws
and
why
does
that
constitute
a
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
cases
of
this
court
or
of
the
federal
courts
generally
do
you
want
us
to
reconsider?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
was
in
--
suppose
that
220,000
dollars
had
been
spent
on
the
improvement
of
a
private
building
that
had
no
connection
with
the
authority
at
all,
would
there
be
any
tax
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
me
ask
you
this
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
let
me
ask
you
this?
counsel
before
you
argued
that
practically
all
that
the
state
gave
them
was
a
skeleton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
they
put
the
rest
of
it
in
themselves,
these
240,000
dollars.
now,
let's
suppose
that
a
private
owner
built
the
skeleton
for
eagle,
and
then
you
put
240,000
dollars
into
the
building
to
complete
it
and
make
it
serviceable
for
your
purposes.
how
would
that
property
be
taxed?
would
it
be
taxed
just
on
the
skeleton,
or
would
it
be
taxed
on
the
skeleton
plus
the
240,000
dollars?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
there
must
be
some
expenditures
in
this
240,000
dollars
that
would
attach
to
the
realty.
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
that
you
pay
no
taxes
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
that
was
in
a
private
building
you
would
pay
taxes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that
portion.
that
portion
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
that
may–
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way?
you
--
if
you
were
in
a
private
building
that
was
delivered
to
you
just
as
a
skeleton
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
you
built
it
up
to
the
point
where
it's
serviceable
for
your
purposes,
could
you,
when
you
leave,
tear
it
down
under
this
kind
of
a
lease
and
leave
a
skeleton?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
in
your
lease?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
that
whenever
the
public
is
about
to
make
a
lease
of
its
property,
particularly
when
there's
no
mention
made
of
segregation
at
all
in
the
lease,
that
it's
the
duty
of
those
who
might
be
discriminated
against
to
come
in
and
ask
for
declaratory
relief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
far
do
you
go?
chief
justice
earl
warren
okay,
you
say
"they
knew."
how
do
you
know
they
knew?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
that
by
reason
of
that
all
negroes
are
refused
the
right
to
exercise
their
constitutional
rights,
whatever
they
may
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what
is
the
distinction
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
took
the
position
though,
that
they're
offensive
to
your
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
it
was
more
or
less
understood
in
this
case
that
it
was
here
on
the
basis
that
you
did
discriminate
–
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
solely
because
of
the
race.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
how
can
you
say
that
you
didn't
do
it
on
the
basis
of
race?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
redding?
