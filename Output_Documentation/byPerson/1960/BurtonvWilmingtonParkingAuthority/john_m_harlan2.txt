the

the

i
didn't

–
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
question
i
wanted
to
ask
you
was,
is
the
restaurant
itself,
either
on
its
menus
or
its
advertising
literature,
carry
any
notation
that
it's
identified
in
any
way
with
the
delaware
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
solicitor
general,
supposing
this
space
had
been
sold,
although
physically
remaining
in
the
same
way
in
which
you
have
described
it,
instead
of
leased,
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
opinion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
you
are
going
to
say
you
would
have
the
same
continuing
--
these
same
factors
that
you
emphasize
—
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
citation?
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i,
before
you
leave
that
subject,
could
you
tell
us
briefly
in
what
respects
the
authority
does
contain
control?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
because
of
the
physical
juxtaposition
of
this
restaurant
in
the
parking
authority
that
anybody
going
in
there
being
excluded
would
assume
that
he
was
being
excluded
with
the
approval,
if
not
on
the
authority
of
the
wilmington
parking
authority?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
say
to
that
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
are
saying
he
couldn't,
nobody
could
read
him
to
draw
those
conclusions,
but
assuming
that
as
sort
of
factual
thing,
supposing
one
took
a
look
at
the
building
and
reached
that
conclusion,
that
one
–
that
a
person
going
in
could
reasonably
say,
this
looks
like
the
wilmington
parking
authority's
setup,
what
do
you
say
then
to
the
argument
that
there
is
no
state
action?
you
say
that
there
is
state
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
a
person
can't
go
in
and
examine
the
legal
relationships
between
the
parking
authority
and
the
physical
relationships.
he
just
deals
with
what
he
sees.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
argument
is
that
state
action
ought
to
reach
to
the
point
where
the
members
of
the
public
who
go
into
a
public
place,
go
into
a
place
which
physically
at
least,
bears
all
the
earmarks
of
being
a
state
enterprise,
that's
the
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
accepting
the
argument.
i'm
asking
you
what's
your
answer
would
be.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
factual
argument.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
accept
his
legal
proposition?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
why
not?
that's
what
i
want
to
hear.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
bearing
do
you
think
the
per
curiam
opinion
of
the
court
in
the
girard
trust
case
has
got
in
this
situation?
do
you
think
that's
germane?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
do
you
take
that
into
account?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
may
be
referring
further
than
the
solicitor
general?
