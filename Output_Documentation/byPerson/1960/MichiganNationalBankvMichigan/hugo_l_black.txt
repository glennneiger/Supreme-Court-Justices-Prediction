what
was
the
reason
for
the
exemption?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
have.
justice

l.
black
for
a
loan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
that
basis,
the
state
decided
a
good
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you've
appended
a
right
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
was
--
i
was
just
trying
to
follow
up
justice
frankfurter's
question
because
i
don't
quite
understand
yet
the
difference.
i
wonder
if
put
this
way,
as
i
understood
your
adversary,
he
says
that
his
bank
has
to
pay
13
times
more
taxes
than
the
building
and
loans,
but
you
say
that's
not
true.
what
is
the
basis
that
would
bring
about
such
a
tremendous
difference
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
relating
to
the
same
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
then
that
he
doesn't
consider
his
capital
to
be
a
not,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
13
--
13
times?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
as
you're
saying
that
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
deposits,
do
you
call
them
capital
or
not
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
your
(inaudible)
your
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
may
i
--
i
thought
that
that
assumes
does
it
not,
that
there
is
a
discrimination,
what
did
it
justify
in
order
to
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
state
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then,
why
does
that
argument
apply
to
it?
i
thought
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
that
with
reference
to
the
type
of
competition
that
your
adversary
stated
making
the
loan
on
houses,
a
building
and
some
property
taking
more,
electing
interest
insofar
as
that
part
shall
do
business
is
concerned
that
the
bank
have
the
business
that
the
building
and
loan
associations
tried
to
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
you
--
stating
what
is
remained?
i
--
i
understood
you
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter
to
say
that
this
court
had
held
in
several
cases,
the
state
to
carry
out
a
policy
to
encourage
the
little
(inaudible)
instead
of
lack
of
(inaudible)
by
making
tax
rates
differ?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
has
that
been
discussed
in
connection
with
fostering
smaller
institutions
rather
than
large
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
misunderstood.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
composes
that
--
that
organization?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
of
them
both?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
quite
hear
you.
could
you
refer
me
to
where
that
is
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
main
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
had
a
reply
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
alright.
