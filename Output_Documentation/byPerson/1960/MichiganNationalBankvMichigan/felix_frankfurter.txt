it
carried
it
out
but
not
by
fixing
it
under
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn’t
find
--
have
you
finished
answering?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
this
recital
of
michigan
legislation
affecting
various
groups
of
financial
institutions
and
more
particularly,
the
taxations
in
which
under
various
enactments,
not
now
under
review
here,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
--
i
--
what
i
meant
to
ask
requires
a
more
detailed
statement.
what
we
have
under
attack
--
under
attack
is
a
particular
tax
claimed
to
be
discriminatory
because
competing
state
institutions
are
not
subject
to
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
order
--
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
discrimination,
there
or
not,
did
i
correctly
understand
you
to
lay
before
the
court
a
system,
a
network
of
taxation
to
which
these
so
called
favored
state
institutions
are
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
under
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
so
is
--
and
that's
what
my
question
is
directed
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
your
purpose
in
doing
so
is
to
show
starting
with
the
assumption
that
in
dealing
--
in
passing
on
the
constitutional
validity
or
the
conflict
between
subjection
of
a
federal
instrumentality
from
which
a
state
instrumentality
is
free
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
is
such
a
discrimination,
one
must
take
into
account
the
whole
network
of
taxation
of
the
state
in
order
to
find
out
whether,
although
the
federal
institutions
maybe
subject
to
a
tax
from
which
a
state
institution
is
free,
conversely,
the
state
institutions
maybe
subject
to
obligations
from
which
the
federal
institution
is
free.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
if
in
fact
or
--
or
if
in
fact
the
discrimination
is
worse,
it's
in
fact,
a
statute
is
passed
levying
a
tax
upon
state
financial
institution
in
competition
with
national
banks
and
not
levied
on
national
institutions,
this
court
doesn't
have
to
find
out
whether
you
had
a
sinister
purpose
or
whether
you
--
whether
you
thought
this
would
or
would
not
advantage
state
institutions
if
in
fact,
in
construing,
in
applying
with
practical
financial
result
of
legislature,
we
don’t
have
to
go
and
to
search
whether
the
purpose
was
a
hostile
one,
as
against
the
federal
banks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
--
including
the
total
tax
incidence
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
reversed
and
the
compliments
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
compliments,
so
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
you've
given
--
you've
given
--
you've
indicated
different
units
of
measure
or
different
--
or
different
basis
of
the
taxation
as
between
the
two
classes
of
institution,
is
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
could
you
translate
that
or
equate
that
into
more
or
less
equivalent
terms
and
see
where
you
come
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying
they're
not
in
competition
or
are
you
saying
that
the
national
bank,
the
appellants
here
had
more
power
for
resources
at
their
disposal
in
competing
with?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
question
is,
"are
they
treated
equally
in
that
effect?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
is,
"are
they
treated
equally?"
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
by
the
state
--
by
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
also
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
would
make
a
difference
if
true,
whether
it's
8
or
13,
would
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
doing
--
and
will
you
be
good
enough
unless
you
have
--
have
not,
have
you
finished
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
answering
justice
black?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
core
of
your
argument?
the
difference
in
--
is
that
financial
competitive
leverage
between
the
national
bank
and
your
--
cooperated,
your
local
bank
due
to
the
statutory
and
other
advantages
that
the
national
banks
have
by
virtue
of
their
charter.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
--
before
you
go
to
the
other
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
isn't,
i'll
come
back
to
a
prior
question
of
mine,
isn't
that
another
way
of
stating
that
they
are
better
equipped
for
the
competition,
not
with
their
--
not
competitors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
i
--
could
i
--
and
here
you
say
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
which
i'm
not
familiar
--
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
taken
into
account
the
actual
fact
that
this
is
a
big
fellow
and
this
is
a
little
fellow
and
therefore,
not
--
they're
not
within
the
5209
proscription.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
--
suppose
that
the
national
bank
builds
up
strength
in
greater
power
to
the
accumulation
of
time
and
the
goodwill,
goodwill
means
the
momentum
of
a
going
concern
and
it
has
more
momentum
than
a
little
fellow.
would
that
not
come
within
the
condemnation
of
5209,
if
we
just
--
if
your
state
made
a
distinction
between
those
--
if
it
made
a
quantitative
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
ultimately,
you're
saying
they're
not
comparable,
because
ultimately,
you're
saying
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
are
they
immune,
these
national
banks?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
are
they
immune?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
they
enjoy
a
federal
immunity,
do
they
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
--
can
you
bind
a
different
qualm
of
enactment,
reach
the
same
dollar
and
cents
result
in
taxing
them
in
a
way
in
which
to
be
--
for
reasons
that
give
them
immunity
under
the
federal
statutes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
do
that
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
say
they
have
an
advantage
which
congress
has
deem
fit
to
give
them
that
had
called
it.
they
--
they're
immune
from
certainly
positions
of
state
tax.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
can't
impose
those
statutes
by
some
indirection,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
flip
the
other
side.
justice
felix
frankfurter
aren't
you
proving
a
little
too
much?
what
you're
now
--
and
if
i
followed
your
argument,
you
now
say,
"these
are,
as
a
matter
of
categories,
different
institutions
in
the
savings
and
loan
institutions
is
but
from
its
very
nature
outside
of
the
restrictive
provisions
of
5219?"
isn't
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
congress
by
legislation
has
treated
them
differently,
doesn't
mean
that
the
state
of
michigan
or
any
other
state
can
treat
them
different,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
say
in
effect,
that
the
body
of
this
--
this
continuing
body
of
legislation
treating
national
banks
in
the
conventional
form
and
savings
loan
institutions
so
far
as
congress
can
deal
with
it
in
the
districts,
as
so
consistently
in
a
body
of
enactment,
treated
them
differently
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
one
is
to
infer
that
5219
impliedly
represents
that
same
by
implication,
that
same
differentiation.
