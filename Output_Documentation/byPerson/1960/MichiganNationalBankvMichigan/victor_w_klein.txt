mr.
victor
w.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
michigan
supreme
court.
the
basic
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not,
the
national
bank
tax
act
known
as
revised
statute
5219
was
violated
by
the
state
of
michigan
under
act
9
of
the
public
acts
of
1953,
taxing
shares
of
national
banks
at
a
rate
13
times
greater
than
the
state
taxes
shares
of
savings
and
loan
associations.
now,
although
act
9
was
enacted
in
1953,
it
relates
back
to
the
1952
taxes.
there
had
been
a
tax
in
effect,
the
appellant
paid
that
tax
some
$18,000
and
then
this
act
9
of
1953
also
imposed
this
new
tax
of
$5.5
per
thousand
of
paid
up
capital
surplus
and
undivided
profits
has
contrasted
with
a
tax
of
only
40
cents
a
thousand
on
shares
of
savings
and
loan
associations.
the
appellant
paid
the
tax,
the
additional
$49,000
tax
under
protest
took
the
proper
procedure,
tried
it
in
front
of
the
court
of
claims
in
michigan,
then
to
the
supreme
court
and
we
are
now
here.
there
are
other
taxes
from
1953
to
1959
or
1960
the
date
in
which
there
are
cases
pending
awaiting
the
determination
of
this
case.
before
giving
even
a
preliminary
outline,
i
want
to
point
out
one
thing
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
tax
immunity
or
tax
avoidance.
this
is
a
tax
--
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
appellant
urges
on
this
court
that
under
the
federal
statute,
national
banks
are
entitled
to
be
taxed
equally
but
at
no
greater
rate
than
other
moneyed
capital
which
comes
into
competition
with
the
business
of
the
national
banks.
and
we
say
in
this
case,
if
that
injunction
of
the
federal
statute
were
observed,
the
state
of
michigan
would
collect
additional
taxes
from
savings
and
loan
associations
shareholders
in
the
annual
amount
of
$8,000,000
a
year.
now
preliminarily,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
submit
that
savings
and
loan
associations
are
the
dominant
and
principle
competitors
of
national
banks
in
the
residential
mortgage
loan
business,
that
that
business
is
a
substantial
business.
in
the
year
in
question,
it
was
over
--
over
a
half
of
billion
dollars
was
employed
in
the
state
of
michigan
by
savings
and
loan
in
their
business,
the
day
over
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
and
that
type
of
business,
your
residential
mortgage
loan
business,
is
a
vital,
essential,
substantial,
important
phase
of
the
business
of
national
banks.
in
the
case
of
appellant,
that
residential
mortgage
loan
business
amounted
to
40%
of
appellants'
total
loans,
three
times
more
than
its
commercial
loans
accounted
for
32%
of
its
total
income
and
constituted
over
20%
of
its
gross
assets.
i
gave
to
that
in
a
preliminary
way
only.
we'll
get
into
the
details.
so,
the
court
has
the
proper
background.
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
year
1952
which
is
the
year
which
--
which
we're
here
concerned,
there
were
77
national
banks
operating
in
the
state
of
michigan
and
there
were
67
savings
and
loan
associations,
about
half
were
domestic
michigan
saving
and
loan
associations
and
the
other
half
federal
savings
and
loan
associations.
the
appellant
bank
is
a
national
bank
which
operates
in
seven
cities
throughout
the
state.
they
are
not
large
metropolitan
cities
like
detroit
where
commercial
loans
are
of
greater
importance
than
they
are
to
the
out
state
bank
mortgage
loans,
residential
mortgage
loans
are
very
important
in
fact,
the
most
important,
i
would
say
operation
of
the
out
state
national
banks.
the
appellant
operates
in
cities
like
battle
creek,
michigan
population
48,000,
port
huron
population
35,000,
lansing
92,000,
saginaw
92,000,
flint
163,000,
grand
rapids
176,000
and
then
one
small
community
of
marshall
5700.
but
they're
all
medium,
small
medium
modern
size
cities
not
comparable
to
the
big
city
banks
although
the
city
banks
are
now
more
and
more
engaged
in
the
residential
mortgage.
now,
with
that
background,
we
come
to
the
power
of
the
state
to
tax.
i
believe
this
court
has
clearly
stated
that
absent
congressional
grant
of
authority
of
the
state,
no
state
has
the
power
to
tax
national
banks
or
their
shares
at
all,
because
national
banks
are
governmental
agencies
instrumentalities
actually
performing
in
many
respects.
the
basic
physical
policies
of
the
united
states
government,
and
this
court
has
therefore
held
that
because
national
banks
perform
that
essential
government
function,
the
state
of
michigan,
no
state
absent
congressional
authority
would
have
power
to
tax
either
national
banks
or
their
shares
at
all,
and
you
so
held
in
two
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
however
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no
sir,
but
one
of
--
there
are
five
intervening
banks
sir
and
one
of
jackson
banks
did
intervene
the
--
the
national
bank
of
jackson
intervened
sir.
the
--
in
the
case
of
the
intervenors
was
held
in
advance
because
the
time
consumed
in
preparing
this
voluminous
record
and
the
burden
upon
us
was
so
great
that
we
elected
to
defer
trial
of
the
intervening
cases
until
the
disposition
of
this
case.
now,
congress
did
authorize
and
empower
states
to
tax
originally
in
1864,
to
tax
only
shares
of
national
banks
and
that
wasn't
broadened
until
1923
when
there
were
two
other
methods
of
taxation
permitted
the
tax
on
the
dividens
from
shares
and
also
in
income
tax
on
the
bank
itself
as
contrasted
with
shares.
and
in
1926,
there
was
authorized.
states
were
permitted
to
impose
a
franchise
tax
measured
by
income.
but
congress
provided
that
when
a
state,
elected
one
method
of
taxation,
that
method
was
in
lieu
of
all
others,
it
could
not
employ
both
methods
at
the
same
time.
in
this
case,
act
9,
i'll
call
it
act
9
of
michigan,
imposed
a
tax
on
shares.
it
is
a
share
tax
just
as
the
original
act
permitted
to
be
imposed,
on
shares
of
national
banks
which
it
imposed
upon
the
bank
which
in
turn
could
or
could
not
pay
it
for
its
shareholders
but
the
assessment
was
made
and
is
made
on
the
banks.
now,
section
r.s.
section
revised
statute
5219,
the
tax
on
shares,
the
empowering
of
a
state
to
tax
on
shares,
specifically
provide
section
1
(b)
that
such
tax
by
a
state
and
i
quote,
"shall
not
be
at
a
greater
rate,
than
as
assessed
upon
other
moneyed
capital
in
the
hands
of
individual
citizens
of
such
state
coming
into
competition
with
the
business
of
national
banks."
now,
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
so
empowered
to
tax,
national
bank
shares
may
only
do
it
in
the
manner
and
through
the
extent
and
subject
to
the
expressed
limitations
provided
by
congress
in
this
r.s.
5219.
one,
the
injunction
is
that
the
tax
shall
not
be
at
a
greater
rate
than
it's
assessed
upon
other
moneyed
capital.
the
other
moneyed
capital
must
come
in
the
competition
with
the
substantial
phase
of
the
business
of
the
national
bank.
and
three,
such
competition
when
compare
is
substantial
when
compared
to
the
total
capitalization
of
national
banks
in
the
state.
in
this
case,
it's
three
times
the
total
capitalization.
now,
looking
at
this
empowering
statute
of
congress,
we
first
determined
what
is
meant
by
other
moneyed
capital.
originally,
when
this
act
was
passed
other
moneyed
capital
meant
any
kind,
all
kinds
of
intangible
personal
property,
stocks,
bond,
judgments,
anything,
coming
in
the
competition
was
not
in
the
statute
and
it
wasn't
a
requirement.
but
in
1887,
this
court
redefined
moneyed
capital
in
the
mercantile
case,
and
it
said,
and
this
becomes
important,
and
i
quote,
"that
moneyed
capital
include
shares
of
stock
or
other
interests
owned
by
individuals
in
all
enterprises
in
which
the
capital
employed
in
carrying
on
its
business
is
money
where
the
object
of
the
business
is
the
making
of
profit
by
its
use
as
money
reduced
again
to
money
and
reinvested."
in
other
words,
moneyed
capital
means
that
its
money
either
employed
by
an
individual,
in
an
individual
capacity
partnership
by
investing
in
shares
and
that
business
employing
it
in
a
business
where
the
inventory
so
to
speak
is
money,
money
is
loaned
out
and
money
is
the
business
carried
out
and
it's
a
business
of
money.
and
we
submit,
and
we'll
get
into
this
more
in
detail,
that
shares
in
a
savings
and
loan
associations
are
moneyed
capital.
in
other
words,
an
individual
buy
some
shares.
those
shares
are
employed
by
a
corporation,
whose
business
is
money,
loaning
out
the
money
primarily
on
real
estate
residential
mortgages.
so
we
say,
initially
and
we'll
get
more
into
detail
on
that,
that
investment
in
shares
in
savings
and
loan
association
is
other
moneyed
capital
because
its
business
is
money,
the
loaning
of
money.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
well,
there
wasn't
up
until
through
the
supreme
court,
sir.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
assumed
it
was
moneyed
capital
but
i
do
believe
at
this
point
the
appellee
questions
asked,
and
we
will
discuss
that
because
we
will
--
if
you
wish
i
will
answer
it
now
appropriately.
up
through
the
supreme
court
of
michigan
including
its
opinion,
i
believe
it
was
assumed
that
it
was
other
moneyed
capital.
and
that
other
moneyed
capital
did
not
have
to
be
in
stock.
it
could
be
an
individual.
i
could
go
in
the
real
estate
mortgage
business
and
put
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
it,
loan
it
out
on
residential
mortgages,
get
paid
back
and
loan
some
more
out,
and
then
if
l
think
i
had
too
much
in
the
business,
i
could
retire
that
and
keep
a
lesser
amount
of
this.
now,
the
second
part
of
the
statute,
the
question
of
coming
into
competition,
it
must
be
moneyed
capital,
coming
into
competition
with
the
substantial
phase
of
the
business
of
national
banks.
originally,
as
up
till
mercantile,
the
moneyed
capital
did
not
have
to
come
into
competition
with
the
business
of
national
banks.
it
was
all
kinds
of
intangible
money.
then
in
mercantile,
the
court
--
this
court
said,
it
had
to
come
into
competition
and
there
was
lot
of
backing
and
filling
and
finally
in
1923
congress
codified
that
determination
of
this
court
into
the
statute
and
provided
that
it
had
to
be
not
only
other
moneyed
capital,
but
it
had
to
come
into
competition
with
the
business
of
national
banks.
and
this
court
has
go
on
further
that
it
had
to
be
substantial
in
amount,
and
that
it
had
to
come
into
competition
with
the
substantial
phase
of
the
business
of
national
banks.
i,
again,
will
come
back
to
the
history.
now,
what
are
the
facts
in
this
case?
today,
in
1952,
these
savings
and
loan
associations
in
michigan
in
fact
throughout
the
country
will
come
into
this
are
nothing
more
than
commercial
enterprises
for
profit
of
its
stockholders
seeking
residential
mortgages
primarily
from
the
general
public
of
all
economic
classes,
rich,
middle
class,
poor,
just
like
any
borrower
from
a
bank,
the
testimony
is
uncontroverted
from
all
the
savings
and
loan
officers
and
they
were
all
hostile,
that
the
borrower
on
the
mortgage
of
the
savings
and
loan
association
was
no
different
than
a
borrower
of
bank
that
they
passed
upon
that
mortgage
solely
on
his
personal
credit
and
on
the
security
of
his
home.
there
was
no
difference.
now,
what
is
the
competition?
we
called
as
witnesses,
16
executive
officers
of
each
of
the
16
savings
and
loan
associations
in
the
city,
is
where
we
did
business.
and
each
one
of
them
admitted
and
i,
again,
say
they
were
hostile
that
they
--
their
associations
were
the
principal,
dominant
competitors
of
national
banks,
our
bank,
in
other
banks,
in
the
business
of
residential
mortgage
loans.
we
obtained
the
recordings
in
the
seven
counties
were
we
did
business
of
all
of
the
mortgages
recorded
in
those
counties
for
the
year
1952,
it's
a
very
voluminous
exhibit
and
there's
abstract
showing
that
the
savings
and
loan
associations
were
the
largest
principle
mortgage
lender
in
those
counties.
we
subpoenaed
the
association
reports
showing
the
competition
and
we
have
the
bank
officers
testified
that
in
their
opinion,
the
savings
and
loan
associations
or
the
principle
and
dominating
competitor
of
appellant
bank
in
the
communities
in
which
they
awkward
it.
their
loans
were
on
the
same
pro-types
of
property,
they
loaned
of
the
same
types
of
individual,
they
loaned
to
all
classes
of
people,
rich,
middle
class,
poor,
of
all
professions,
business
not
just
wage
earners.
that
is
undisputed.
now,
if
your
honors
would
be
good
enough
to
look
at
page
17,
because
i
think
that
tells
the
story
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
--
of
our
principle
brief,
our
principle
brief.
we
have
a
chart
on
page
17
of
our
principle
brief.
page
17
sir.
now,
the
top
line
and
this
is
all
back
by
the
testimony.
the
top
line
shows
the
seven
cities
in
which
the
appellant
bank
operates.
in
1952,
our
bank,
in
the
seven
cities
had
$60,000,000
of
residential
mortgage
loans,
some
contract
did
in
that
year
and
in
some
priorities.
the
16
savings
and
loan
associations
had
$97,000,000
of
loans
in
those
same
cities.
now,
the
next
chart
and
these
numbers
might
be
helpful
if
you
would
write
on
the
left
side
of
the
page
77
because
that's
the
national
banks
in
michigan
and
on
the
right
side
of
page
67,
there
were
77
national
banks
in
michigan,
that's
the
left
side
of
the
page,
and
the
right
side
of
the
page
67
associations,
it
shows
that
in
1952
the
banks
had
$300,000,000
of
residential
mortgage
loans,
and
the
67
101,
savings
and
loan
associations
had
$433,000,000,
many
contracted
during
the
year
1952
on
the
same
basis.
now,
the
next
chart
shows
a
comparison
of
national
basis
and
then
the
very
extraordinary
and
interesting
thing
is
the
1957
figure
which
shows
that
in
the
five-year
period
from
1952
to
1957,
savings
and
loan
mortgage
business
increased
three
times
greater
than
the
mortgage
loan
business
on
residences
of
national
banks.
and
we
say
with
all
humility
and
we've
read
the
records
in
most
of
the
leading
cases
on
this
subject,
that
we
doubt
that
there's
any
case
in
which
there
has
been
such
a
showing
of
extensive
and
dominating
competition
by
the
other
moneyed
capital
with
the
business
of
a
national
bank
as
we
have
demonstrated
in
this
record.
we
say
on
the
showing
that
we've
made
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
the
rate
is
greater
the
money
invested
by
savings
and
loan
associations
and
shares
is
other
moneyed
capital
that
this
is
substantial
in
amount,
and
it
competes
with
the
substantial
phase
of
the
business
of
national
banks.
you
so
decided
in
hartford,
minnesota,
anderson,
and
richmond.
now,
we
submit
to
the
court,
that
notwithstanding
this
showing
of
competition
in
a
substantial
vital
phase
of
our
business
and
i
again
point
out
that
the
residential
mortgage
loans
in
appellant
bank
were
$60,000,000
and
its
commercial
loans
were
only
$22,000,000.
in
other
words,
their
residential
mortgage
loan
business
was
three
times
greater
than
our
commercial
loan
business.
we
say
notwithstanding
that
showing,
the
lower
court
in
the
appellee
statute
admitted
extensive
competition.
in
fact,
you
cannot
have
competition
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
savings
and
loan
associations
are
of
a
different
character,
purpose
and
organization.
in
other
words,
the
appellee
puts
this
question
in
its
brief,
how
can
fundamentally
different
institutions
be
in
substantial
competition
under
r.s.
5219?
pointing
out
that
savings
and
loan
associations
under
the
michigan
law,
under
the
federal
law
cannot
accept
deposits,
cannot
engage
in
the
general
banking
business.
competition
in
fact
is
extensive,
at
minute,
they
dominate
the
fee.
carried
to
its
final
conclusion,
this
decision
of
the
lower
court
in
our
opinion
and
the
contention
of
appellee,
means
that
there
could
be
no
business
that
could
engage
in
the
business
of
deposits
or
general
banking
except
the
bank.
and
following
further,
the
only
conclusion
you
can
reach
from
that
argument
is
that
other
moneyed
capital
means
other
banks.
this
court
in
hartford
and
in
richmond
and
in
minnesota
has
held
directly
to
the
contrary.
congress
was
act
--
asked
on
two
or
three
different
occasions
to
limit
the
term
"other
moneyed
capital"
to
other
banks,
and
it
refused
to
do
so.
the
michigan
court
and
appellee
contend
contrary
that
the
position
taken
by
this
court
and
contrary
to
the
act
of
congress.
the
next
point
appellee
makes
--
says
"well,
savings
and
loan
don't
engage
in
all
of
the
banking
activities
and
therefore,
you
can't
be
in
competition."
and
this
court
also
has
decided
in
hartford
and
in
minnesota
that
competition
may
exist
under
the
statute
even
though
the
competition
be
with
some
but
not
all
phases
of
the
business
of
national
banks.
and
on
this
character
and
nature
proposition,
this
court
has
said,
competition
in
the
sense
intended
arises
not
from
the
character
of
the
business
of
those
who
compete,
but
from
the
manner
of
the
employment
of
the
capital
at
their
command
and
pointed
out
the
gross
of
various
businesses
not
in
the
banking
business,
in
phases
of
the
business
of
national
banks
which
if
permitted
to
enjoy
favored
state
taxation
would
place
the
national
bank
shares,
those
who
invested
in
national
bank
shares
any
distinct
and
decided
disadvantage.
then,
the
next
argument
appellee
makes
well
even
if
one
competitors
in
one
phase
and
some
competitors
in
another
phase,
you've
got
to
show
that
this
competes
in
all
phases
of
the
banking
business
have
been
favored
by
taxation.
and
this
court
certainly
has
held
to
the
contrary
we
believe,
when
it
says
a
particular
phase
so
long
as
that
phase
is
substantial,
substantial
in
amount
and
substantial
when
compared
to
the
total
capitalization
of
all
banks.
that
this
residential
mortgage
business
is
substantial
in
the
case
at
bar,
i
again
say
is
demonstrated
when
i
tell
you
that
40%
of
appellant's
loans
are
in
the
residential
mortgage
business.
we
get
32%
of
our
income,
total
income
from
the
residential
mortgage
loans
and
it
constitutes
over
20%
of
our
assets.
and
furthermore,
this
competition
of
savings
and
loan
associations
at
that
time
$1.5
billion
dollars
in
1959
over
$1.5
billion
invested
in
shares
was
three
times
the
total
capitalization
of
all
national
banks
in
the
state
of
michigan
which
is
the
test
this
court
has
laid
down.
appellee
says,
or
--
or
the
lower
court
says,
this
is
too
narrow
field
of
the
banking
business,
which
as
i
pointed
out.
it's
probably
the
most
important
field
in
the
out
state
national
banks
today,
and
it's
gotten
to
be
a
very
important
field
in
all
nations.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
no,
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
they're
all
comparable
size
sir.
the
record
is
replete
with.
i
don't
--
we
have
exhibits,
we
asked
witness
after
witness.
they're
the
same
type
of
loans
and
the
same
locality,
the
same
type
the
houses.
in
fact,
we
have
dozens
and
dozens
of
exhibits
where,
they,
the
associations
refinanced
the
bank
loans
and
the
banks
refinanced
the
association
loans.
we
have
pictures
that
we
didn't
put
it
in
this
exhibit
showing
the
identical
houses,
the
neighborhoods,
the
character,
the
type
of
people,
they're
the
same,
sir.
they're
all
types
of
loans.
there
are
some
conventional
loans,
there
are
fha
loans,
and
there
are
va
loans.
at
that
time,
the
associations
took
more
conventional
loans
percentage-wise
than
we
did,
although
we
have
many
conventional
loans.
we
took
percentage-wise
more
fha
and
va
loans
then
the
savings
and
loan
associations.
although
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
that
is
it
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
20
--

involved
in
this
competition
question.
in
1926,
you
had
a
subsequent
case
but
this
phase
of
the
case
was
not
discussed.
there
was
the
hartford
case
and
the
minnesota
case
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
1926.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
they
were
to
a
small
degree
but
they
were
sufficient
for
this
court
to
recognize
that
the
competition
of
mortgage
contenders
individual
partnerships
and
incorporations
in
the
state
of
both
wisconsin
and
minnesota
was
substantial
enough
to
have
the
court
say
that
the
discriminatory
tax
could
not
be
maintained
because
of
the
competition
sir,
and
that
was
the
unanimous
court
in
both
to
those
cases.
now,
the
one
point
of
shares
the
appellee
claims,
the
lower
court
didn't
get
into
this
and
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
have
said.
the
lower
court
didn't
raise
this
question.
but
appellee
now
says,
"all
these
shares
and
savings
and
loan
associations
are
not
other
moneyed
capital,
because
they're
like
bank
deposits,
and
commercial
bank
deposits
aren't
other
moneyed
capital."
they
raised
this
for
the
first
time.
now,
that
position
is
directly
contrary
to
the
michigan
statute
which
provides
that
a
payment
for
shares
is
for
capital
stock,
capital
stock.
it's
contrary
to
the
bylaws
of
these
associations
which
cause
these
payments,
capital
and
provides
for
the
issuance
of
shares
and
stock.
it's
contrary
to
the
stock
certificates
which
are
--
coupled
of
which
are
attached
to
our
reply
brief
wherein
its
whole
capital
stock
and
they're
transferable
in
the
manner
of
capital
stock
now
in
some
instances,
the
certificates
in
a
booklet.
this
--
this
question
was
raised
before
the
michigan
supreme
--
and
--
and
there's
also
a
provision
in
the
michigan
statute,
that
these
associations
cannot
take
deposits
and
that
a
shareholder
of
an
association
is
not
a
creditor.
so,
how
a
shareholder
could
be
a
depositor
if
he
couldn't
be
a
creditor,
and
if
the
association
couldn't
take
deposits
as
suggested
by
appellee
is
beyond
us,
but
to
go
further,
this
counsel,
the
attorney
general
of
michigan
argued
before
the
michigan
supreme
court
two
years
ago
just
as
we
are
arguing
before
you
today,
and
he
took
the
position
successfully
in
a
case
where
the
question
was
whether
a
state
agency
could
invest
in
shares
of
savings
and
loan
associations.
the
savings
&
loan
league
of
michigan
attempted
to
have
a
determination
that
in
substance,
a
share
was
lightly
deposit
and
therefore,
it
didn't
violate
the
constitutional
injunction
of
michigan
against
agencies
purchasing
shares
in
a
corporation.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes
sir.
and
the
attorney
general
very
enabling
a
sale
the
position
of
the
savings
&
loan
league,
and
pointed
out
and
we
put
the
quotation
in
our
reply
brief
that
payments
on
shares
of
savings
and
loan
associations
do
not
constitute
deposits.
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
said,
in
substance,
in
substance,
they
do
not
constitute
deposit,
but
purchases
of
stock
in
a
private
corporation
for
profit.
those
are
the
attorney
general's
work
on
"private
corporation
or
profit."
so
we
submit
that
this
is
moneyed
capital,
and
it
fits
within
the
definition
of
this
court
shares
in
a
corporation
or
other
interest
of
an
individual
put
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
a
business
or
profit.
these
are
shares,
they're
stock,
the
statute
says
so,
the
case
is
so
hold,
the
attorney
general
of
michigan
has
always
been
of
that
opinion
because
there
are
a
number
of
opinions
which
we've
have
cited.
and
the
michigan
supreme
court
says
that
that
is
their
relationship.
and
the
language
of
the
federal
statute
is
also
in
terms
of
shares
and
capital.
now,
we
come
to
the
next
question,
they
say
its
other
moneyed
capital
coming
in
competition
was
a
substantial
business
of
national
banks
and
substantial
in
comparison
with
the
capitalization
of
national
banks.
we
say
the
question
of
greater
rate
requires
no
great
debate.
it
can't
be
controverted
that
the
rate
is
13
times
greater;
it
just
takes
simple
mathematics
$5.5
of
thousand
versus
40
cents
of
thousand.
now,
on
domestic
corporation
--associations
in
michigan,
there
was
a
25
cents
of
thousand
in
your
privilege
tax.
so,
even
giving
the
domestic
corporations
credit
for
that,
that
would
be
$5.5
to
65
cents,
eight
times,
8:1,
13:1
in
case
of
federal
association.
now
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
the
other
taxes
were
unimportant
sir.
the
both
banks
and
associations
have
to
pay
the
same
type
of
real
estate
tax
valued
in
the
same
manner
at
the
same
rate
also
unemployment
taxes,
both
were
subject.
so,
it
becomes
out
--
there's
an
examination
fee
which
we
say
it's
for
a
service
that
banks
have
to
pay
an
examination
fee.
there
were
few
other
taxes
which
we've
listed
in
our
brief,
but
it's
very
inconsequential
sir,
and
i
think
for
all
practical
purposes,
we
can
say
13:1
in
cases
of
federal
associations,
13
--
8:1
domestic
corporations.
so
what
does
the
appellee
do
in
the
court
below?
he
urged
the
proposition
directly
contrary
to
the
position
of
this
court
and
the
michigan
court
followed.
he
said,
"because,
we're
dealing
with
two
different
types
of
organizations
here,
one
that
takes
deposit
does
lot
of
business
with
deposits
and
one
that
does
not."
this
tax
shouldn't
be
on
shares,
it
ought
to
be
measured
by
the
tax
burden
on
total
assets
of
each
institution.
in
other
words,
if
we
figured
out
how
many
dollars
of
taxes
banks
paid
or
the
bank
in
our
bank
pay
and
took
the
ratio
of
total
assets
without
deducting
the
deposit
liability
of
it
and
did
the
same
thing
for
savings
and
loan
which
didn't
borrow
very
much
because
they
are
a
more
conservative
operation
in
banks
in
that
respect
that
we
have
that
liability.
why?
they
said
there
is
substantial
equality.
now,
to
do
that
required
and
rewriting
in
the
statute,
this
is
a
tax
on
shares
not
on
gross
assets
of
the
corporation.
and
this
court
held,
when
this
very
same
proposition
was
urged
to
this
court
in
minnesota
in
1926.
the
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
the
tax
authorized
by
5219
is
against
the
holders
of
the
bank
shares,
and
is
measured
by
the
value
of
the
shares
and
not
by
the
assets
of
the
bank
without
deduction
of
its
liabilities.
in
other
words,
it's
a
tax
on
the
shares
not
on
the
assets
of
a
corporation
without
deducting
its
liabilities
to
ascertain
the
equity
of
the
shares.
the
minnesota
--
this
court
minnesota
completely
rejected
without
qualification
that
argument.
now,
the
appellee
--
and
the
michigan
court
followed
the
rule
which
is
directly
contrary
to
this
court
in
minnesota.
now,
the
appellee
urges
that
this
court
considered
a
different
tax,
just
ignored
the
fact
that
the
share
of
capital,
and
only
take
the
reserves
and
undivided
profits
of
the
savings
and
loan
associations.
and
if
you
did
that,
you
might
get
approximate
equality.
first
place,
the
michigan
statute
doesn't
permit
that.
the
michigan
statute
says,
"this
is
a
tax
on
the
shares
of
savings
and
loan
and
only
the
paid
up
capitals
for
that
part."
it
talks
not
about
the
undivided
profits,
and
if
the
tax
under
paid
up
capital
of
the
national
bank
and
its
undivided
profits
and
its
service.
we
submit
that
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
going
back
to
weaver
and
hepburn
which
cited
in
our
brief,
that
where
you
have
the
same
type
of
taxation
which
you
do
here,
this
is
not
a
question
of
different
methods
of
taxation.
any
tax
which
exacts
from
the
owner
of
the
shares,
a
larger
sum
in
proportion
to
their
actual
value
than
it
does
from
the
owner
of
other
moneyed
capital,
valued
in
a
light
manner
thus
tax
them
at
a
greater
rate.
it
doesn't
just
decide
in
one
case,
the
shares
are
invested
in
a
corporation
which
borrows
little
money
and
some
shares
are
invested
in
the
corporation
which
borrows
more
money
and
a
bank
has
a
lot
of
indebtedness
to
bank
deposit.
it
doesn't
say
that
that
congress
has
said,
once
we
determine
that
this
is
other
moneyed
capital
and
it
comes
in
competition
substantially,
rate
valued
in
the
same
manner,
if
it's
the
same
type
of
tax
is
the
determining
bank.
now,
the
last
point,
and
that's
the
point
upon
which
i
think
appellee
and
the
lower
court
relied
very
heavily
a
so-called
"partial
exemption
ordinance."
there
were
some
old
cases,
going
back
to
the
1800s
up
till
1899
are
originally
when
moneyed
capital
was
not
as
its
now
defined
when
it
wasn't
--
its
inventory
wasn't
money.
it's
all
intenders
of
any
kind
didn't
have
to
come
in
competition
with
the
bank
in
the
old
days.
and
some
portion,
not
material,
was
exempt
noncompeting.
the
court
in
those
days
said,
"there
could
be
a
partial
exemption.
it
was
not
in
competition
and
it
was
not
moneyed
capital
as
now
defined."
if
it
was
a
material,
even
though
not
in
competition,
there
was
violation.
then
when
the
court
decided
mercantile
and
throughout
the
years
and
limited
moneyed
capital
to
only
those
businesses
share
--
which
--
which
shares
were
had,
which
business
was
moneyed.
the
competition
became
the
dominant
factor,
and
not
for
61
years
has
this
court
ever
mentioned
partial
exemption
anymore
in
any
case.
but
even
if
there
is
a
partial
exemption
doctrine
now,
we
say
there
is
not.
we
say
that's
been
gone
with
this
new
principle
of
coming
into
competition
was
a
substantial
phase
of
the
business
through
the
bank.
but
even
if
that
doctrine
applies,
the
appellee
presents
to
this
court
the
most
extraordinary
proposition.
he
contends
that
the
state
of
michigan
having
granted
partial
exemption
to
shares
of
savings
and
loan
associations,
this
court
is
foreclosed
from
considering
whether
or
not
there
was
just
cause
from
the
--
for
the
state
exempting
from
taxes
something
which
might
violate
that
federal
statute
which
have
just
caused
to
exempt
something
under
a
federal
statute
and
he
suggests
this
court
can't
even
consider
that
question.
we
submit
in
the
first
place,
that
although
originally
savings
and
loan
associations
were
exempt
by
michigan
statute,
they
no
longer
are.
they
are
subject
to
taxes,
and
there
is
no
partial
exemption
that
tax
is
on
all
of
the
shares
but
add
1/13th
of
the
rate.
that
isn't
a
partial
exemption,
that's
a
preference
a
tax
of
discrimination.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes,
sir.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
yes,
sir.
now,
in
arriving
at
this
so-called
just
cost,
appellee
relies
on
old
cases
at
a
time
one,
when
national
banks
could
not
be
in
the
mortgage
business.
it's
only
been
permitted
to
have
mortgages
since
1916
and
really
in
real
volume
since
1933,
a
work
permitted
to
take
savings
until
1927
by
statute.
they
weren't
in
the
competition
factually
or
otherwise
with
savings
and
loan
associations
in
those
days.
now,
on
the
just
cause
for
exemption
--
mr.
victor
w.
klein
in
the
old
days,
sir?
mr.
victor
w.
klein
first,
the
savings
bank
cases.
they
dealt
with
poor
people
of
limited
means
who
had
no
place
to
put
their
savings
and
no
place
to
get
mortgages.
and
they
--
in
the
savings
bank
cases,
they
were
publicly
managed.
the
--
the
trustees
were
appointed
by
the
state
not
by
the
depositors.
now,
the
savings
and
loan
associations
in
the
older
days
and
justice
taft
--
then
judge
taft
commented
in
an
early
case
in
1890
or
something
that
they
were
comprised
of
poor
people
who
banded
together
under
a
mutual
thrift
plan
to
afford
a
facility
from
which
they
could
borrow
money.
and
that,
and
that
i
--
that
worked
in
this
way
and
michigan
had
the
same
case.
it
was
quasi
charitable,
nonprofit,
noncommercial,
because
you
had
to
be
a
borrower,
you
had
to
be
a
stockholder,
and
he
could
only
bid
for
a
loan
to
the
extent
that
he
has
subscribed
for
his
stock.
he
couldn't
bid
more.
in
other
words,
in
the
old
days
if
i
were
a
poor
man
which
i
might
qualify
filed
--
i
had
to
be
a
stockholder,
i've
signed
up
for
$1000
worth
of
stock
and
agreed
to
pay
$2
or
$5
a
week.
and
then,
when
the
money
was
bid
on,
i
could
come
and
bid
for
it
in
competition
with
other
stockholders,
but
i
can
only
bid
up
to
the
amount
of
my
stock
subscription.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
--
or
a
mortgage
against
the
other
members
who
own
stock.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
for
a
loan.
he
had
to
pay
a
premium
in
those
days.
then
he
would
get
a
loan
for
$1000
and
he'd
have
to
pay
on
his
stock
subscription.
the
only
thing
he
paid
on
his
mortgage
was
interest.
he
paid
so
much
a
week
on
his
stock
subscription
and
if
the
--
there
was
money
profit
made,
the
dividends
would
pay
--
be
paid
to
him
and
he
could
then
use
that
to
pay
his
interest.
if
there
were
losses,
he
got
no
dividends
or
received
no
dividends.
and
in
case
of
a
failure,
and
this
is
the
importance,
he
had
to
pay
his
mortgage
loan
100%
in
full,
received
no
credit
for
what
he
had
paid
on
the
stock.
in
fact,
he
might
have
had
to
pay
the
balance
of
his
subscription
of
general
creditors
when
it's
answered.
so,
he
was
on
both
sides
of
the
deal.
it
was
a
cooperative,
noncommercial
neutral
enterprise.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
exempt,
but
it
doesn't
exempt
in
anymore
sir.
the
federal
government
removed
the
exemption
in
1951
and
we
quoted
the
part
in
there
and
they're
to
be
taxed,
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
these
associations
be
taxed
just
like
other
corporations.
now,
in
1935,
the
state
of
michigan
amended
the
home
owners
act
and
we've
got
a
little
writer
on
page
72
of
our
principle
brief.
i
hope
it's
been
appended
to
all
of
your
briefs.
it's
page
76,
your
honor.
pointing
out
that
in
1935,
the
stat
--
this
section
was
amended
so
no
longer
does
a
stockholder
--
does
a
borrower
have
to
own
stock
in
order
to
take
a
loan.
in
other
words,
he
doesn't
have
to
be
an
investor
and
he
doesn't
--
he
can
borrow
any
amount
regardless
of
what
his
stock
ownership
may
be.
he
doesn't
even
have
to
be
a
stock
ownership
before
he
can
only
borrow
to
the
extent
of
his
stock
ownership.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
well,
we've
asked
that
it'd
be
appended
on
page
76.
we
asked
the
clerk
to
do
it.
now,
he
may
have
failed
to
do
so.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
well,
we
will
--
we
will
ask
the
clerk
to
do
it
again.
we
have
extra
copy
because
that
calls
your
attention
to
this
one.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
see,
sir.
now,
that
is
a
significant
change
because
now,
there
is
no
mutuality
and
stockholders
are
from
all
economic
classes,
corporations,
trust,
pension
trust,
professional
men,
businessmen,
they're
out
solely
for
the
profit
and
borrowers
are
out
solely
to
get
the
best
loans
they
have.
there's
no
mutuality
of
interest.
one
is
just
like
a
--
any
stock
in
a
--
in
a
corporation
where
you're
out
to
get
as
much
profit
as
you
can
and
the
borrower
is
out
to
get
as
much
as
he
--
to
the
best
loan
he
can
get.
and
the
class
of
investors
are
all
classes
across
the
board,
no
longer
poor
people.
as
i
say,
there
is
advertising
campaigns
locally,
statewide,
nationally.
in
fact,
over
the
weekend,
there
were
two
national,
big
national
corporations,
football
games,
savings
and
loan
people
seeking
to
get
investors
of
all
classes,
corporations
otherwise
to
invest
in
their
stock
or
savings
and
loan
associations
seeking
to
get
borrowers
of
all
classes.
and
it's
no
different
in
a
bank
they
compete
for
the
mortgage
business
just
as
they
do
in
the
case
of
banks
and
there
is
no
just
reasons,
no
just
reasons
why
they
should
enjoy
a
preference,
and
it
is
a
preference,
it's
not
an
exemption
in
state
taxation
in
view
of
the
injunction
of
congress
that
a
state
shall
not
pass
this
other
moneyed
capital
at
a
greater
rate
than
national
banks.
and
if
there's
every
been
a
time
when
our
fiscal
policy
and
our
economic
stability
had
to
be
safeguard,
i
think
most
responsible
people
are
in
agreement
that
such
time
is
now
and
in
encroachment
of
this
kind
against
national
banks
would
be
very
serious
indeed.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
i
should
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
victor
w.
klein
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
within
the
limited
few
minutes
i
have
left,
i'll
endeavor
to
answer
two
or
three
basic
errors
in
the
argument.
the
basic
error
of
appellee's
argument
and
of
professor
woodward
is
the
appellee
does
not
like
r.s.
5219,
which
is
a
tax
on
shares
of
national
banks
and
he
only
wants
the
comparison
made
not
with
other
moneyed
capital
in
any
form,
but
only
with
institutions
which
have
the
power
to
take
deposits
and
to
do
a
general
banking
business,
because
there
is
no
business
whatsoever
which
may
take
deposits
except
a
bank.
this
court
has
held
that
other
moneyed
capital
is
not
limited
to
banking
institutions
or
the
institutions
which
may
take
deposits,
you've
said
it
in
richmond,
you've
said
it
in
hartford
and
you've
said
it
in
minnesota.
and
congress,
on
several
occasions,
was
asked
to
change
the
law
to
limit
it
to
other
banks
and
refused
to
change
it.
this
is
a
tax
on
shares
and
not
on
all
of
the
assets
of
the
institution.
the
same
argument
advanced
by
appellee
was
advanced
by
the
state
of
minnesota
in
the
minnesota
case
where
they
too
said,
"banks
can
do
business
on
deposits
forgetting
that
they
had
to
pay
those
deposits,
they're
liabilities"
and
said,
"compare
the
tax
burden
not
on
shares
or
total
assets
deducting
the
deposit
liability."
the
state
of
minnesota
made
the
same
argument,
but
this
court
said,
"oh,
no,
this
is
a
share
tax.
you
must
compare
the
net
assets
after
deducting
liability
or
the
capital
stock."
moneyed
capital
therefore,
can
mean
the
investment
of
an
individual
who
may
not
take
deposits
and
the
investment
of
any
business,
which
may
not
take
deposits.
and
i
submit
the
shreveport
case,
sustains
our
position
because
that
case
was
raised
on
two
questions
and
that
followed
hartford
shortly.
number
one,
the
state
--
the
bank
attacked
it
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
savings
and
loan
were
not
like
banks.
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
was
a
reasonable
classification,
but
on
the
second
ground
of
attack
that
it
violated
this
revised
statute,
the
national
bank
tax
act,
the
court
did
not
say
it
was
of
a
different
character
and
couldn't
come
under
r.s.
5219,
no.
mr.
justice
brandeis
went
into
the
question
and
said,
"there
was
no
competition
in
fact,
the
banks
weren't
competing
or
the
savings
and
loan
weren't
competing
with
the
banks."
he
wouldn't
have
discussed
that
had
he
held
that
there
were
such
different
comparable
character
that
they
couldn't
as
a
matter
of
law,
compete
with
one
another.
now,
on
the
proposition,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
"little
fellow
versus
big
fellow."
in
this
instance,
there
are
67
savings
and
loan
associations
and
77
national
banks
in
michigan
and
if
you
check
the
chart
on
page
17,
you
will
see
that
those
67
savings
and
loan
associations
did
a
far
greater
residential
mortgage
business,
then
the
77
national
banks,
including
appellant.
and
if
your
honors
would
be
good
enough
to
see
what
has
happened
on
page
81
of
our
brief,
the
growth
of
these
savings
and
loan
associations
since
the
change
in
character
in
1935,
has
been
phenomenal
both
in
michigan,
it
has
gone
up
from
1940,
from
a
$116,000,000
to
$537,000,000,
till
today,
it's
over
$1,200,000,000
and
nationally,
the
growth
has
gone
from
$5,000,000,000
in
1940
to
$63,000,000,000.
so,
these
aren't
little
institutions
which
are
helpless.
they
have
had
a
phenomenal
growth
and
their
in
the
mortgage
business
has
been
at
least
three
times
greater
than
the
growth
of
national
banks.
now,
this
reference
to
mr.
chief
justice
about
state
banks
complaining
or
other
banks.
the
michigan
banker's
association
as
an
association
did
not
take
that
position.
it
was
a
three
or
four-man
committee.
they
were
asked
later
when
it
came
to
our
attention
to
submit
it
to
the
membership
for
a
vote.
they
refused
to
do
so.
sixty
odd
banks
including
state
banks
sir,
attempted
to
file
a
brief
amicus
in
this
court,
protesting
the
position
taken
by
this
tax
committee.
and
this
tax
committee
on
the
proof
of
this
attorney
general
went
to
the
state
legislature
because
--
not
because
they
thought
this
tax
was
a
valid
tax,
they
didn't
want
a
state
income
tax
and
they
preferred
this
to
a
state
income
tax
and
said,
"we
will
assist
the
state
to
defend
this
tax,
this
tax
of
doubtful
validity,
if
its
validity
is
attacked
by
a
national
bank"
and
they
certainly
cannot
bargain
away
the
rights
given
to
congress.
the
small
tax
committee
has
no
power
to
bargain
away
our
rights
under
the
law
and
rights
of
other
national
banks.
thank
you.
