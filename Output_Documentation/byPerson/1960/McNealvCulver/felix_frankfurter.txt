justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
does
the
printed
record
contain
both
the
proceedings
in
its
(inaudible)
at
the
trial
as
well
as
habeas
corpus?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
full
--
was
the
full
proceeding
at
trial
before
the
habea
--
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
how
can
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
tell
what
took
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
we
hear
all
the
testimonial
part
of
the
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
witnesses
for
the
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
take
the
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
his
testimony
is
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
this
record?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
denial
of
the
defense
or
a
--
or
a
confession
and
--
as
it
were
a
confession
avoidance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
is
the
defense
was
insanity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
there
a
denial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
the
--
of
the
charge
--
of
the
--
of
the
occurrence
on
--
on
the
basis
of
which
the
charge
is
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
he
could've
--
ineptness,
meaning,
personal
or
legal
ineptness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
--
did
he
address
the
jury
after
--
after
he
left
the
witness
stand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
don't
know
what
issues
the
judge
left
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
thought
--
as
i
understood
you
a
minute
ago,
you
--
the
punishment
is
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
had
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
he
achieved
getting
a
different
name
for
the
same
20
years,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
disproven,
am
i
right
in
my
recollection
that
in
part
of
the
habeas
corpus
issue
is
from
the
supreme
court
itself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
the
disposition
--
if
the
writ
is
issued
in
an
order
to
show
cause,
the
proceedings
thereafter
are
by
affidavit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
kind
of
a
master
for
those
people.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
can
hear
witnesses,
of
course,
he
does.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
just
on
the
--
the
petition
for
the
writ
and
the
return
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
all
the
annexes.
that's
the
--
that
exhibit
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
basis
of
which
your
supreme
court
did
what
it
did,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
means
that
we
don't
have
to
send
it
to
a
county
judge
whatever
you
call
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
he
took
no
part
in
--
in
choosing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
judge
participate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i,
in
light
of
all
that
you've
said,
ask
this.
suppose
the
court
agreed
with
you
as
to
the
disparity
between
the
conclusion
reached
by
this
--
by
your
supreme
court
and
the
relevant
criteria
by
which
a
conclusion
should
have
been
reached.
what
--
what
do
you
suggest
as
the
proper
relief
to
be
given
by
this
court,
a
new
trial
or
to
send
it
back
to
the
state
court
for
them
to
explore
these
various
--
all
these
puzzles
that
you
have
whenever
we
have
doubling,
the
court,
through
the
appointment
of
one
of
the
judges,
point
out
to
the
facts
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
tell
whether
they
weren't
or
how
can
we
tell
the
fact
that
florida
may
go
beyond
the
requirements
of
due
process?
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
--
to
reverse
a
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
--
does
it
that
--
i
don't
see
that
that
follows.
we've
got
lots
of
cases
here
where
people
have
counsel
and
local
rules
are
not
followed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
addressing
my
problem
to
your
suggestion
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
violation
of
a
state
law,
not
reaching
the
infringement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
(inaudible)
to
reverse
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
did
you
get
into
this
case,
when
this
court
appointed
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
his
writ
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
he
did
that
himself?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
--
where
is
the
case
in
florida
where
that
was
done?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
that
it
is
the
practice
in
florida,
when
the
supreme
court
entertains
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
and
sends
it
to
a
commissioner,
it
is
your
practice
then
to
supply
the
petitioner
with
a
--
with
counsel
for
the
proceeding
before
the
commissioner?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
say
that
it
seems
a
little
odd
that
the
state
should
--
is,
if
i
may
say
so,
sensible
and
fair-minded
in
providing
counsel
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
shouldn't
it
be
providing
counsel
in
--
in
the
main
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
actually
could
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
understood
me
as
commending
you
for
doing
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i'd
like
to
know
this.
you
said
you're
flooded
with
these
cases.
that
was
your
word.
may
i
ask
about
how
many
a
year
you
have
roughly?
what's
order
of
magnitude?
justice
felix
frankfurter
200
or
50?
justice
felix
frankfurter
over
200.
now,
how
many
of
those
200
arise
in
cases
by
convicted
defendants
who
are
tried
without
the
aid
of
counsel,
good
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
50%
arise
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
counsel
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
florida
might
save
a
lot
of
time
and
worry
in
expense
and
perhaps,
prestige.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
the
main
evil?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
forgive
me
for
making
the
suggestion
that
considering
the
number
of
cases
that
have
come
up
here
in
my
time
from
florida,
it's
quite
a
number,
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
suggest
that
the
wise,
the
wise
attitude
disclosed
or
reflected
in
your
steiner
case
that
it
shouldn't
all
be
left
to
counsel,
to
the
--
to
the
skill
or
exigencies
or
pressure
or
what
mattered
to
counsel
but
it
might
help
to
have
a
record
more
complete
in
view
of
the
number
of
cases
that
has
come
up
here
where
we
have
to
be
with
these
inadequate
records
considering
the
facts,
considering
the
facts
that
the
betts
and
brady
limitation
turns
on
the
totality
of
what
the
whole
proceeding
shows.
it
might
well
be
that
--
that
a
man
might
show
certain
qualities,
when
he
deals
with
the
charge
that
he
hasn't
shown
in
cross-examining
witnesses.
i
just
go
out
of
my
way
to
put
that
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it?
there's
a
volume
of
business?
are
they
on
the
great
pressure
on
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
trial
courts,
mr.
henderson?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
climate,
i
suppose,
encourages
that.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
the
charge,
suppose
the
charge,
the
judge
in
charging
the
jury,
points
out
these
are
the
differences
of
degree
under
your
code,
if
it
is
a
code,
and
then
points
out
how
narrow
the
distinctions
are
and
how
conflicting
the
views
are
but
it's
up
to
you
gentlemen
or
--
gentlemen
and
--
do
you
have
ladies
on
the
jury
as
part?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
sir.
justice
felix
frankfurter
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
the
jury.
that
in
itself
would
carry
some
persuasiveness
in
this
--
that
these
questions
are
of
some
difficulty
for
a
man
who
isn't
immersed
or
at
least
familiar
with
the
law.
i
--
or
it
might
show
the
opposite.
he
might
show
the
distinctions.
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
i
--
my
imagination
isn't
equal
to
postulating
either
one
of
the
other
but
it
is
equal
to
say
that
the
charge
may
reveal
what
kind
of
a
problem
was
before
the
jury
and
therefore,
whether
the
defendant
was
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
the
distinctions
that
were
being
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
position
is
that
the
evidence
that
we
have,
the
testimony
of
the
state's
witnesses
and
the
examination
--
and
cross-examination
of
mcneal,
in
your
view,
show
that
he
was
fully
fit
and
capable
of
dealing
with
the
charge
against
him.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
way
--
in
a
way,
mr.
henderson,
this
is
a
subtle
--
begging
of
the
question
because
here
is
a
case
where
a
fellow
says,
"i'm
incapable
of
meeting
the
charge"
and
you
say
the
burden
is
on
him
to
have
the
skill
of
knowing
how
to
put
his
case.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what's
involved.
