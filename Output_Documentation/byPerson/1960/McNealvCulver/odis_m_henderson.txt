mr.
odis
m.
henderson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
now
my
honor
and
privilege
to
extend
to
this
honorable
court
the
greetings
and
compliments
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida.
in
approaching
the
case
at
bar,
i
wish
to
reiterate
some
of
the
matters
that
counsel
has
already
covered
in
order
that
my
presentation
might
assume
a
somewhat
orderly
form.
this
petition
was
first
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
on
or
about
march
24,
1959.
the
petition
contained
only
two
points
of
law
and
two
issues
were
involved.
one
issue
had
to
do
with
whether
or
not
his
fundamental
rights
had
been
abridged
by
reason
of
his
allegation
that
he
was
not
furnished
a
copy
of
the
information
in
this
cause.
his
original
petition
emphasized
that
point.
it
almost
stated,
almost
as
an
afterthought,
that
he
had
also
been
denied
right
to
counsel.
in
our
original
response
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
we
dedicated
practically
all
of
our
response
to
his
first
position
taken
relative
to
the
absence
of
the
information.
the
court
--
that
also
--
another
reason
why
we
did
that
is
that
particular
question
had
never
been
passed
upon
by
a
florida
appellate
court.
as
to
--
we
have
in
our
constitution
in
--
in
article
11
of
the
declaration
of
rights
saying
that
that
must
be
done.
and
so,
our
supreme
court
took
the
same
position
that
they
did
in
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
on
an
identical
question
and
ruled
that
the
record
showed
evident
waiver
of
this
right,
also
ruling
that
it's
a
ministerial
function
and
unless
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
it
was
not
done,
it
will
be
assumed
that
the
judge
or
the
court
did
their
duty.
so
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
no,
sir.
our
practice
there
in
matters
of
this
nature
is
--
we
have
a
very
lenient
practice
to
--
with
business.
we
--
we
--
our
office
is
flooded
with
these
petitions
each
week
and
we
present
the
response.
the
--
the
matter
goes
to
the
court
on
the
written
petition
and
the
response.
if
the
--
if
the
petition
shows
merit,
if
it
shows
a
question
of
fact
which
cannot
be
answered
in
a
--
in
a
legal
manner
or
on
points
of
law,
the
court
--
the
supreme
court
then
appoints
a
circuit
judge.
a
commission
--
commissioner
is
called.
then
the
petitioner
--
the
circuit
judge
is
--
is
commissioned
to
take
testimony
and
to
determine
questions
of
fact
and
law
and
submit
a
written
report
back
to
the
supreme
court
and
the
decision
is
made
by
the
supreme
court.
on
such
hearings,
the
petitioner
is
present
while
he
is
not
entitled,
as
a
matter
of
law,
to
an
attorney
during
those
hearings,
we
have
always
asked
the
court
to
appoint
one
for
him.
these
attorneys
serve
without
compensation
and
i
can
--
i
can
promise
that
they
always
do
a
good
job
as
is
evident
by
this
court-appointed
attorney
that
has
appeared
here
today
for
the
petitioner.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
while
it
is
not
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
--
while
it
is
not
mandatory,
we,
in
the
attorney
general's
office,
take
this
position
that
if
our
supreme
court
feels
that
there
is
a
question
of
fact
which
should
be
determined,
then
we
think
that
we
owe
this
--
our
supreme
court
the
courtesy
of
--
of
providing
counsel
so
that
that
question
of
fact
can
be
dealt
into.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
i
would
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
it
would
be
over
200.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
over
50%
of
them.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
believe
that
i
can
give
the
court
a
reasonable
explanation
of
that
as
we
go
along.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
this
--
the
question
i
just
mentioned
relative
to
--
to
the
information
has
been
abandoned
in
these
proceedings
and
we're
now
here
on
a
single
--
the
single
issue
of
whether
or
not
elijah
mcneal
was
arbitrarily
denied
his
right
to
counsel
in
the
court
below
and
if
so,
was
such
denial
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
under
our
federal
and
state
constitutions.
now,
the
history
of
this
case
is
significant
and
i
believe
it
will
become
increasingly
so
to
the
court
as
we
go
along.
the
dates
involved
here
are
particularly
significant.
on
february
the
24th,
1959,
this
court
reversed
our
florida
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
ray
cash
versus
culver,
a
similar
case
in
some
respects.
the
petition,
in
this
case,
was
filed
subsequent
to
that
reversal.
the
briefs
were
filed
subsequent
to
that
reversal.
the
opinion
of
our
florida
supreme
court
in
the
instant
case
was
filed
after
having
received
your
reversal
in
cash.
and
thus,
it
is
that
we
have
continued
in
our
brief
and
we
do
here
that
when
our
supreme
court
denied
the
relief
requested
by
this
man,
it
did
so
with
the
tones
of
reversal
bringing
clearly
in
those
judicial
ears,
as
you
signified
in
the
cash
case.
in
that
cash
case,
you
laid
down
a
yardstick
for
our
supreme
court
to
be
guided
by
in
such
cases
as
this
and
we
feel
like
that
they
have
attempted
to
do
so
and
we
think
that
when
we
come
to
a
comparison,
a
fair
and
honest
logical
comparison
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
as
applied
to
the
yardstick
which
you
supplied
us
in
the
cash
case,
that
we
think
that
we
have
complied
with
your
mandate
and
we
believe
that
we
can
make
that
increasingly
fair
to
you.
first,
we
realize
that
any
obligation
that
we
hope
to
furnish
counsel
in
noncapital
cases
to
indigent
defendants
is
by
virtue
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
--
and
the
previous
opinions
of
this
court
wherein,
stated
generally,
the
defendant,
by
reason
of
age,
physical
or
mental
incapacity,
is
not
able
to
present
any
type
of
defense
in
his
own
behalf.
now,
this
court
examined
the
cash
file
and
determined
that
he
came
within
that
rule.
taking
that
opinion
and
--
and
comparing
it
to
mcneal,
we
have
this.
first,
we
want
to
compare
the
records
before
the
court
and
this
is
significant.
in
cash,
that
record
came
up
here
on
a
bare
petition
and
a
bare
benial
--
denial.
it's
a
practice
in
our
court
down
there
that
if,
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
petition
does
not
contain
sufficient
allegations
which
would
merit
the
writ
--
the
issuance
of
the
writ,
then
they
--
they
simply
enter
a
blank
denial
of
the
relief
requested.
that
is
all
that
--
and
at
that
time,
our
practice
was,
down
there,
was
every
monday
morning,
we
would
load
up
our
baskets
full
of
the
petitions
and
go
over
there
to
the
court
and
as
they
would
be
called
out,
we
would
reply
orally.
and
if
in
our
opinion
we
could
not
answer
the
allegations
contained
there,
we
would
so
advise
the
court.
the
court
would
then
issue
the
writ
and
further
proceedings
would
be
held.
if
--
we
took
the
position
that
if
all
these
allegations,
even
if
admitted,
were
not
yet
sufficient
to
--
to
be
awarded
relief.
we
ask
the
court
to
deny
the
issuance
of
the
writ
and
that's
what
happened
in
that
particular
case.
so,
the
only
record
that
you
had
up
here
in
cash
was
his
petition
wherein
he
set
out
all
of
these
standard
things
that
our
jailhouse
lawyer
down
there
tells
him
to
put
in
there.
you
had
a
blanket
denial
of
the
writ.
therefore,
under
your
previous
ruling
in
hawk,
as
i
believe
it
is,
hawk
versus
olson,
every
allegation
in
that
petition
had
to
be
taken
as
true.
and
certainly,
a
review
of
that
petition
would
--
would
show
you
that
--
that
there
was
some
merit
to
the
petition
if
the
allegations
were
taken
as
true.
the
record
in
this
case,
that's
before
you,
is
much
more
complete.
i
hasten
to
agree
with
counsel
that
it
should
be
more
complete
than
it
is
but
it
is
far
more
complete
than
was
the
record
in
the
cash
case.
you
have
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
pardon,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
the
burden
in
florida,
as
i
assume
it
is
in
most
jurisdictions,
is
for
the
person
making
the
allegations
to
--
to
furnish
the
proof
of
such
allegations.
now,
we
were
never
furnished
anything
but
a
bare
petition.
it's
our
practice
then
to
go
over
to
the
prison
division.
we
have
a
consolidated
office
for
all
prisons
in
tallahassee
and
we
have
these
man's
records.
and
we
take
from
that
record
the
necessary
papers
and
documents
to
put
in
our
response
and
since
he
raised
no
question
of
trial
irregularities
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
he
raised
no
question
of
trial
irregularities
in
his
petition,
his
only
question,
as
i've
said,
the
--
another
reason
why
the
record
isn't
any
more
complete
than
it
is,
if
your
honor
please,
is,
again,
i
go
back
to
our
previous
statement,
that
it
was
the
impression
of
everyone
concerned
that
his
primary
complaint
had
to
do
with
the
information
not
being
given
to
him.
and
we
--
we
attempted
to
answer
that
as
a
matter
of
law
and
we
didn't
need
very
much
record
and
of
course,
once
the
record
was
formulated
there
in
florida,
we
couldn't
add
to
it
to
bring
it
up
here.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
had
reference
to
the
argument
contained
in
the
petition
wherein
he's
apparently
concentrated
on
the
other
question.
we
didn't
ignore
--
we
didn't
ignore
this
question
in
the
supreme
court
but
we
merely
passed
on
it
in
our
response.
i
believe
we
had
one
paragraph
to
it
under
which
we
relied
on
the
established
rules
of
this
court
and
of
florida
wherein
we
alleged
that
it
was
not
a
capital
offense,
that
the
record
showed
it
was
a
simple
charge
and
simple
evidence
to
support
it,
that
there
is
no
showing
that
this
man
was
incapacitated
to
the
extent
that
he
could
not
defend
himself
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there's
an
affirmative
showing
that
he
did.
and
that's
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
--
that's--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
no,
sir,
it
is
not
necessary
but
under
the
rules
in
keeping
of,
according
keeping
of
the
spirit
of
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
and
as
adopted
and
articulated
in
sneed
versus
mayo,
a
florida
case.
it
is
greatly
encouraged
that
they
do
and
i
can
tell
this
court
that
most
of
them
do
and
i
--
i
have
practiced
criminal
law
all
over
florida
and
i
had
never
been
in
a
court
where
that
observation
was
not
made,
in
other
words,
the
admonition
or
the
advice
given
this
man.
and
it's
--
well,
it's
not
binding
or
arbitrary.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
no,
sir,
it
is
not.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
very
so,
your
honor.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
our
supreme
court
in
case
after
case
has
admonished
our
trial
judges
to
make
a
more
complete
record
and
it's
well
voiced
by
mr.
justice
sebring
in
the
sneed
case
wherein
he
--
he
tells
them
and
--
and
he's
throwing
it
out
as
advice
to
all
of
our
judges
that
that
needs
to
be
done.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
we
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
we
have
a
lot
of
litigation
in
florida.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
rather
brought
what,
your
honor?
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
don't
know
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
--
i
don't
know
why--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
--
i
don't,
of
course
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
our
--
our
supreme
court
rule
making
power
is
very
flexible
and
while
i
don't
pretend
to
speak
for
that
court,
i
--
i
see
no
reason
why
it
couldn't
extent
to
this
area.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
--
it's
the
primary
duty
of
the
trial
judge
coupled
with
the
clerks
of
the
circuit
court.
the
normal
cases,
you
have
the
minutes
of
the
court
showing
arraignment.
you
have
the
plea.
and
speaking
of
voir
dire,
the
voir
dire
examination
is
very
seldom
ever
put
in
the
record
in
florida.
it
begins
with
the
--
with
the
first
witness,
as
does
this
record,
as
it's
not
mandatory.
you
can
--
you
can
request
it
if
you
want.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
and
ends
with
rebuttal,
with
--
now,
the
--
that
is,
if
you
pay
the
court
reporter
extra
to
take
your
closing
argument,
he'll
do
that.
otherwise,
your
record
ends
with
the
charge
to
the
jury.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
the
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
i
would
say,
if
your
honor
please,
that
if
the
--
we've
always
taken
the
position
that
it
is
presumed
that
a
trial
judge
does
his
duty
and
we
rely
on
that
presumption
and
now,
if
it's
presumed
that
--
that
the
absence
of
a
charge
and
--
and
the
record
is
prima
facie
evidence
that
the
judge
did
not
do
his
duty,
then,
certainly,
the
burden
would
have
been
upon
me
to
furnish
some
court
with
it
beginning
in
florida.
but
it
would
appear
that
that
burden,
if
the
petitioner
is
going
to
rely
on
some
deficiency
in
the
record,
he
should
have
--
have
alleged.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
in
his
original
petition.
in
other
words,
if
he
wanted
to
allege
that
the
trial
judge
gave
an
improper
charge
or
didn't
charge
the
jury
at
all,
then
he
had
that
opportunity.
then
the
burden
would
have
been
upon
me
to
see
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
did
charge
the
jury.it's
--
it's
assumed
that
he
did.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
didn't,
at
that
time,
feel
that
the
obligation
was
upon
me
to
do
--
to
go
that
far.
in
other
words,
that's
the
easy
question
before
this
court.
it's
simply
"does
the
record
here
reflect
that
elijah
mcneal
was
so
incapacitated
by
reason
of
age,
experience,
education,
mental
or
physically
infirmity
that
he
should
have
been
appointed
counsel?"
that's
the
only
--
the
only
question
i
see
here.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
if
the
charge
were
improper,
it's
--
it
would
have
been
a
proper
subject
for
appealing
this
case.
this
case
was
--
the
conviction
was
never
appealed
and
we
--
our
court
has
ruled
time
and
time
again
that
habeas
corpus
proceedings
cannot
be
substituted
for
appeal.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
it's
evident
that
the
charge
was
given.
that's
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
a
less
--
lesser
offense
and
that
with
which
he
was
charged.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
that's
it,
your
honor,
and
going
back
to
these
matters
and
--
and
it's
coupled
with
a
previous
question,
the
burden
is
on
the
petitioner
to
furnish
those
documents
necessary
to
support
his
allegations.
now,
he
furnished
this
record
to
this
transcript
and
we
--
we
just
have
to
take
the
position
that
upon
the
record
that's
furnished,
he
has
not
--
he
has
not
supported
his
allegations
and
the
only
way
we
can
do
that
is
to,
again,
compare
it
with
cash.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
you
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
follow
you,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
13
months,
your
honor.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
--
i
wouldn't
be
able
to
answer
that.
it's
our
--
i
don't
--
if
i'm
--
if
i
--
i
don't
have
any
independent
recollection,
whether
i
did
it
in
this
case
or
not,
but
it's
my
usual
practice
to
write
to
these
petitioners
and
advise
them
what
to
do
and
it's
possible
that
i
did
in
this
case.
we
--
we
defend
lots
of
them
down.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
said
the
state
defends
lots
of
them
down
there.
we
turn
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
so,
that
the
--
the
state
advises
them
from
time
to
time
on
many
matters.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
pardon.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
it
might
be
that
i
advised
him
of
how
--
what
procedures
to
take
to
get
his
problem
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
i
take
the
position
that
the
--
that
there
is
--
the
deficiency
in
the
record
does
not
affect
the
question
before
the
court.
i
still
say
the
simple
question
is
whether
or
not
the
record
shows
that
he
comes
within
the
cash
case
or
doesn't
and
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir,
but
we
--
we're
aware
of
many
of
them
and
we
relied
on
some
of
them
in
our
brief.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
he
ordered
it
from
the
court
reporter.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
don't
believe
he
did.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
legal
proceedings
involved
in
--
on
--
on
appeal,
it's
necessary
that
the
entire
record
go,
especially
if
there
is
evidentiary
questions
involved.
in
a
case
of
this
nature,
it's
actually
not
--
not
necessary
that
any
record
go,
except
that
which
can
substantiate
the
allegations
made
in
the
petition.
for
instance,
if
he
had
merely
alleged
that
the
--
the
judge
charged
on
a
totally
different
crime,
all
he
would
have
to
send
up
was
the
charge
in
the
court.
if
he
alleges
any
other
isolated
wrongful
act
that
happened
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
he
would
merely
have
to
send
that
portion
of
the
record
which
would
substantiate
his
allegations.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
it
--
the
same
question
might
be
--
well
be
asked
of
how
the
state
would
protect.
now,
those
things
are
guided
--
how
would
the
state
protect
itself
if
you
take
those
allegations
as
true?
when
a
man
waits
all
this
length
of
time
and
comes
up
with
a
blank
allegation
that
the
judge
didn't
do
this
or
didn't
do
that
and
then
does
not
support
it,
it
would
certainly
put
the
state
at
a
disadvantage.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
that's
true.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
that,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
charges
to
the
jury
in
criminal
trials?
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
we
have
standard
forms
that's
--
that
there
again,
there's
no
set
rule.
the
--
most
trial
judges
carry
with
them
in
court
a
large
book
containing
charges
on
practically
every
criminal
offense
punishable
and
they
sometimes
have
to
paraphrase
from
one
form
to
another.
others
use
a
standard
form
books
put
out
by
robinson
in
florida
that
have
a
form,
a
standard
form
for
practically
every
kind.
others
just
get
it
from
memory.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
no,
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge.
we
won't
--
we
--
getting
back
to
the
tradition
the
state
takes,
it's
whether
or
not
this
record
shows
that
this
man
was
so
incapacitated
that
he
should
have
had
an
attorney.
we're
again
comparing
him
with
cash
since
that
again
is
the
formula
that
you
furnished
us.
and
we
say
that
another
thing
that
probably
influenced
this
court
in
cash
was
that
he
was
a
--
an
uneducated
farm
boy
of
20
years
old
wherein
mcneal
was
a
29-year
old
negro
man,
a
veteran
of
almost
six
years
in
the
army.
there
again
would
indicate
if
they
kept
him
six
years,
it
would
indicate
that
he
was
not
completely
devoid
of
some
mentality,
that
he
was
a
gi
student.
i
assume
that
he
was
a
gi
student
because
he
says
"i
--
i
get
money
for
going
to
school.
the
government
pays
me
for
going
to
school,"
and
that's
the
only
way
i
know
that
--
that
you
could
get
that
pay,
that
he
was
an
employee
at
a
nursery.
now,
that
would
indicate
a
man
of
at
least
a
normal
intelligence.
the
--
another
thing
we
feel
that
--
that
influenced
this
court
in
the
cash
case
was
that
cash
was
tried
twice.
the
first
time
he
was
represented
by
an
able
--
able
lawyer
from
the
dade
county
bar.
that
trial
ended
in
a
mistrial.
while
he
was
--
after
that
trial,
he
was
sent
back
to
raiford
and
placed
in
solitary
confinement
and
his
lawyer
withdrew
from
the
case
without
his
knowledge
until
just
prior
to
the
time
he
was
brought
back
to
be
tried
again.
and
the
second
trial,
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
and
they
convict
him.
at
least
this
court
recognized
the
first
mistrial
as
a
concrete
evidence
of
the
help
that
a
lawyer
gave
him
that
he
--
that
was
unavailable
to
him
in
the
second
trial.
we
have
no
such
indication
of
innocence
in
this
case.
now,
this
opportunity
to
obtain
counsel
is
another
thing
that
we
feel
that
this
--
this
case
should
turn
on.
cash,
as
going
again
as
comparison,
as
i
said,
cash
was
placed
in
solitary
confinement
immediately
after
his
first
trial.
he
was
unable
to
obtain
counsel
and
he
asked
for
counsel.
when
he
went
to
court
at
the
first
opportunity,
he
asked
the
court
to
"give
me
time
to
get
counsel
of
my
own
choice
or
in
the
alternative,
please
appoint
one
for
me."
mcneal
had
much
more
opportunity
than
that.
he
was
arrested
on
the
night
of
his
offense
on
--
on
november
10th,
1958
or
1957.
and
thereafter,
in
february,
he
was
convicted
some
over
three
months
between
the
time
he
was
arrested
and
the
time
he
was
convicted
and
the
--
he
does
not
allege
that
he
was
in
jail
during
this
three
months
and
the
record
doesn't
reflect
whether
or
not
he
was
in
jail
but
we
get
the
reasonable
indication
from
the
record
that
he
was
not
in
jail
during
this
three
months.
and
we
say
it's
reasonable
and
logical
because
in
his
testimony,
the
--
he
was
asked,
"do
you
draw
compensation?"
his
answer
was
"i
draw
compensation
for
the
school
but
the
pension
was
cut
off."
question,
"what
kind
of
work
do
you
do?"
answer,
"i
work
at
the
nursery
in
lake
garfield."
this
matter
took
place
down
in
the
garden
spot
of
florida.
and
these
questions
and
answers
indicate
the
--
this
--
the
present
tense
connotations
of
his
answers
indicate
that
"i
work
now".
now
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
--
that
not
only
indicates
that
this
man
was
out
three
months
when
he
had
an
opportunity
to
get
counsel
but
it
also
indicates
that
he
draws
money
from
two
sources,
from
the
government
and
from
the
nursery.
and
in
there
is
all
the
opportunity
a
man
would
want
in
the
world
to
get
counsel
and
would
certainly
take
him
out
of
the
purview
of
the
rule
laid
down
by
this
court
in
--
in
mcnabb
and
other
cases.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
said
we
assume
that
by
a
reasonable
conclusion
taken
from
the
record
when
he
--
by
his
answers.
the
record
doesn't
show
specifically
whether
he
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
--
was
in
or
out.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
we
felt
that
it
was
a
reasonable
inference
to
make
and
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
don't,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
did
not.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
had
i
anticipated
the
case
coming
here,
i
would
have
put
more
in
the
record
in
florida
but
it
had
--
once
the
record
was
perfected
there
and
we've
felt,
at
that
time,
we
had
enough
in
the
record
to
dispose
of
the
case
and
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
have
to
agree
with
that,
yes,
sir,
but
it
was
not
done
in
this
case.
we
felt
that
that
deduction
could
be
reasonably
obtained
from
this
entire
record.
it's
further
stated
in
the
record
that
this
man
had
a
big
family,
his
mother
and
father
and
a
big
family
living
right
there
in
polk
county.
there,
again,
an
indication
that
he
--
he
was
not
cut
off
from
an
opportunity
to
obtain
counsel.
the
--
another
factor
that
is
considered
in
cases
wherein
the
right
to
counsel
is
involved
is
the
complexity
of
the
elements
involved
in
the
charge.
going
back
to
the
cash
case
again,
and
this
court
considered
that
in
the
cash
case,
the
complexity,
burglary
for
which
cash
was
charged
is
usually
a
case
--
an
offense
committed
in
the
stealth
of
nighttime
and
usually,
it's
detected
only
by
scientific
means,
fingerprints,
casts
and
finally,
the
conviction
is
seldom
obtained
unless
you
have
the
testimony
of
an
accomplice
which
brings
in
many
complex
questions
of
law.
the
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir,
there
was.
there
was.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
his
conviction
would
never
have
been
obtained
without
it.
incidentally,
cash
went
back
on
this
court's
ruling
and
the
question
was
asked,
"what
happened
to
him?"
he
went
back
and
a
new
trial
was
ordered
eventually
and
he
--
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
case.
the
--
the
offense
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
first
degree
murder
is
one
in
florida
which
could
not
possibly
put
a
judge
on
reasonable
prior
notice
that
the
issues
or
testimony
would
be
so
complex
that
a
normal
person
of
ordinary
intelligence
could
not
defend
himself
against
it.
it's
--
logically,
the
court
knows
it's
an
offense
committed
against
the
person
of
another
as
opposed
to
this
property
that
there's
always
an
eyewitness
to
--
to
such
an
offense
and
usually,
more.
as
in
this
case,
there
were
a
number
of
eyewitnesses.
the
testimony
is
simple
and
that's
why
the
entire
testimony
here,
it
certainly
is
short.
it's
32
pages,
but
it
covers
the
entire
story
of
what
happened
down
there
at
that
juke
joint
that
night.
elijah
mcneal
got
into
altercation
with
the
proprietors
of
this
place
and
came
out
second
best.
he
then
departed
to
his
home,
went
directly
and
produced
a
loaded
shotgun,
came
directly
back
and
in
order
to
further
the
point
that
he
was
discussing
when
he
was
there
before,
he
fired
pointblank
into
a
group
of
these
people.
he
missed
the
man
that
he
was
gunning
for
but
he
hit
four
more.
now,
that's
the
entire
story
of
what
happened
down
there.
there's
no
need
for
any
more
testimony.
the
officers
testified
that's
what
happened.
now,
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
did
he
have
a
guardian?
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
believe
i
can
explain
that.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
show
in
the
record
but
when
a
person
is
put
in
one
of
those
wards,
assuming
he
was,
giving
him
credit
for
his
testimony
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir,
he
stayed
there.
they
many
times
treat
him
with
electric
shock
therapy
treatment
and
when
--
after
they
have
undergone
that
type
of
treatment,
they
cannot
be
released
unless
someone
signs
for
them
and
lives
with
them
because
they
have
a
tendency
to
blackout
during
the
first
week
after
they
leave
there.
that's
been
my
experience
in
that
line
and
i
assume
that
that's
what
he
meant
by
guardian.
now
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir,
for
incompetents
or
minors.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
--
my
reasoning
on
that
is
that
he
does
not
have
and
he
did
not
have
because
of
his
statement
that
his
pension
was
cut
off.
that
would
mean
that
if
he
was
under
any
type
of
illness,
that
he
had
been
pronounced
secured
when
his
disability
pension
was
cut
off.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
that
was
a
paper
from
the
--
a
doctor
at
the
hospital
stating
that
he
had
received
certain
treatment
some
13
months
prior
to
then.
the
paper
was
not
admitted
into
evidence
but
the
record
reveals
that
the
trial
judge
inspected
the
paper
and
evidently,
there
was
nothing
on
that
paper.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
he
says
that
his
paper
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
from
the
doctor
saying
that
"i
was
at
the
hospital
and
took
treatments"
i
believe
it
is
or
words
to
that
effect.
the
trial
judge
examined
that
and
evidently,
found
nothing
in
it
that
would
put
him
on
notice
that
the
man
might
then
be
under
some
mental
incapacity.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
that
he
had
had
blackouts,
yes,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
that
was
his
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
don't
think
there's
anything
else
in
there
to
explain
it.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
no,
sir.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
the
only
thing
under
our
law
that
that
letter
could
have
possibly
helped
him
is
a
provision
in
the
law
that
even
at
anytime
prior,
during
or
after
the
trial
of
the
case,
if
a
suggestion
of
insanity
or
incapacity
is
presented
to
the
judge
or
if
he
is
made
aware
of
it
directly,
he
can,
upon
his
own
motion,
have
this
man
examined
to
see
whether
or
not
he
is
mentally
able
to
stand
trial.
and
that's
why
i
said
that,
evidently,
there
was
nothing
important
in
that
paper
or
the
judge
would
have
been
put
on
notice
that
man
might
be
incapacitated
and
i'm
certain
that
he
would
have
had
him
examined
had
that
paper
reflected.
coupled
that
--
coupled
with
the
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
had
the
same
reaction
when
i
read
the
record
but
unfortunately
for
the
petitioner,
he
defeated
that
purpose
by
his
own
testimony.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
when
he
says
he
asked
the
court
that
he
wanted
mercy,
that
he
didn't
intend
to
kill
anybody
down
there
that
night,
that
"if
i
had
intended
to
kill
a
man,
i
believe
i
would
have
killed
him."
here
in
his
last
sentence,
it's
very
significant.
"i
was
trying
to
scare
them
and
stop
them
from
jumping
on
people."
by
his
own
admission,
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
down
there.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
to
say,
under
our
law
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
he
--
that
defense
was
available
to
him
had
he
presented
it
and
the
only
matter
in
which
he
intended
to
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
it
may
or
may
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
it
--
it
may
or
may
not
have
been,
depending
on
what
he
could
establish.
what
he
did
establish
was
that
whatever
mental
incapacity
he
had
suffered,
it
was
over
13
months
prior
to
the
trial,
that
he
certainly
was
not
in
the
hospital
then.
he
worked
at
a
nursery.
he
went
to
school.
and
there
was
nothing
that
would
put
the
judge
on
notice
that
this
man
should
be
examined
to
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
sir,
worked
at
this
nursery
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
yes,
sir.
that
interpretation
of
"sometime",
i
--
i
wouldn't
know
how
to
interpret
that.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
i
said
the
entire
transcript
is
32
pages,
the
original
transcript.
that
includes
his
testimony
and
the
state's
testimony.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
did
--
i
merely
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
if
--
if
all
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
are
presented,
if
it's
immaterial
as
to
whether
the
trial
takes
20
minutes
or
20
days,
all
the
--
the
perfect
element
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
murder
in
the
second
degree
were
presented
here
and
they
were
presented
adequately
by
one
witness.
they
were
presented
just
as
adequately
by
mcneal
himself
in
his
testimony
when
he
said,
"i
was
trying
to
scare
them."
well,
i'll
try
--
you
--
you
can
try
to
scare
somebody
with
a
shotgun
by
shooting
into
them
like
that.
there's
the
--
there's
the
element
of
second
degree
murder
which
is
the
unlawful
killing
of
a
human
being
when
perpetrated
by
an
act
eminently
dangerous
to
another
in
axing
a
depraved
mind
regardless
of
human
life.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
there's
no
written
rule
or
law,
only,
if
your
honor
please,
it's
a
matter
of
custom
and
practice
that
they
do
it
frequently.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
people,
unless
they
are
charged
with
a
heinous
offense,
probably
have
a
little
better
chance
without
an
attorney
because
the
--
the
judge
helps
him
along
and
they
incur
the
sympathy
of
the
jury
and
this
--
i
don't
know
how
much
this
man
was
helped
prior
to
trial.
there's
a
long
--
several
places
in
there
where
the
judge
advised
him
as
to
his
rights
in
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
recall
one
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
--
if
your
honor
please,
where
he
asked
for
the
proprietor
whether
or
not
the
other
people
involved
were
armed
or
whether
one
of
the
other
people
were
armed,
in
other
words,
exploring
the
possible
idea
of
self-defense.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
that's
the
one
i
recall.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
manner
--
the
nature
of
the
statement
involved
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
an
admission
against
interest
or
a
judicial
or
extrajudicial
confession.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
well,
it
has
to
be
judicial
or
extrajudicial
confession
if
it's
a
simple
statement
against
interest,
such
as
this
appears
to
be,
and
of
course
that
question
was
never
raised
until
mr.
daniels
was
on
this
case
that
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
no,
sir,
it
wasn't
raised
at
the
trial.
and
there
was
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
the
--
i
--
the
--
the
admission
i
was
talking
about,
"i
--
i
shot
one
of
them,"
i
believe,
something
like
that.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
but
our
rule
also
is
whether
it's
sufficient
--
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
i
--
i
have
to
admit
that
it
borders
on
a
confession
but
our
rule
is
also
that
if
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict
beyond
the
--
such
matters,
that
is
considered
harmless
error.
thank
you.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
will
sum
up
very
briefly
by
saying
this.
that
the
elements
which
rule
the
cash
case
are
totally
missing
from
this
case.
the
only
question
again,
we
feel,
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
this
record
showed
that
this
man
had
reasonable
intelligence.
we
say
it
does.
we
say
he
participated
in
his
own
defense.
we
say
that
the
record
showed
that
he
--
he'd
been
in
the
army
six
years,
that
he
attended
gi
school,
that
he
worked
at
a
nursery,
that
he
did
know
what
he
did
down
there
that
night
because
he
said,
"i
meant
to
--
to
scare
them."
we
say
that
if
this
court
rules
that
a
man
of
that
experience
and
of
that
intelligence
is
required,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
be
represented
by
a
state-appointed
counsel,
then
you're
going
to
open
the
door
so
wide.
of
course,
you're
going
to
put
a
lot
of
lawyers
to
work
but
you're
going
--
you're
going
to
open
it
wide
enough
where
we'll
have
to
have
them
in
--
in
municipal
courts.
we'll
have
to
have
them
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
also
extends
to
property
rights
as
well
as
human
rights.
we'll
have
to
have
them
when
some
--
in
another
time,
someone
sues
somebody
for
an
old
debt
and
we
say
it's
opening
the
door
too
wide.
we
say
that
--
that
this
case
is
--
is
no
stronger
and
not
much
different
than
the
betts
versus
brady
case,
which
we've
quoted
in
our
brief,
wherein
this
very
court
ruled
that
he
was
a
man
of
sufficient
age
and
intelligence
to
--
to
defend
himself
and
therefore,
not
come
within
the
purview
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
finally,
we
say
that
this
man
did
represent
himself.
no
lawyer
in
the
world
could
have
presented
but
one
defense
to
this
case
and
that
was
lack
of
intent
to
kill.
and
if
he
established
that
defense
himself
adequately
when
he
testified,
"i
didn't
mean
to
kill
anybody.
i
wanted
--
i
just
wanted
to
scare
them
and
keep
them
from
jumping
on
the
people,"
and
the
jury
gave
him
every
benefit
of
the
doubt
by
reducing
the
verdict
to
assault
with
the
intent
to
commit
murder
in
the
second
degree,
which
it
actually
was.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
term
allowed
by
florida
statutes
which
does
not
necessarily,
in
and
of
itself,
infer
prejudice
on
the
part
of
the
judge.
we
say
that
we
have
attempted
to
follow
your
mandate
that
you
handed
down
in
cash.
we
ask
that
you
recognize
that
we
have
followed
it
and
affirm
the
decision
previously
handed
down
by
the
florida
supreme
court
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
odis
m.
henderson
thank
you.
