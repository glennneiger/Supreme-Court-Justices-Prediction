mr.
sam
daniels
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
is
serving
a
20-year
sentence
imposed
upon
him
by
the
state
of
florida.
at
present,
he
has
17
more
years
to
serve.
the
underlying
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
--
mr.
sam
daniels
17
years,
your
honor.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
underlying
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
florida
denied
him
due
process
of
law
when
it
tried,
convicted
and
sentenced
him
while
he
was
admittedly
unrepresented
by
counsel.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
summarize
the
petitioner's
position.
first,
it
is
our
contention
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
due
process
requires
the
state
to
offer
or
furnish
counsel
to
a
prisoner
in
a
noncapital
case
whenever
there
are
special
circumstances
which
show
that
without
representation
by
counsel,
the
petitioner
or
the
prisoner
cannot
have
a
fair
and
adequate
defense.
in
turning
to
the
special
circumstances
which
we
contend
exists
in
the
present
record,
we
say
that
there
are
six.
they
are
these,
first,
ignorance,
second,
mental
illness,
third,
complicated
substantive
issues
involved
in
the
trial,
fourth,
difficult
evidentiary
problems,
fifth,
the
use
of
inadmissible
testimony,
entirely
prejudicial
testimony
to
convict
and
sixth,
the
fact
that
the
unrepresented
petitioner
received
no
aid
from
the
trial
judge
in
guiding
him
pass
the
errors
which
make
trial
without
counsel
unfair.
the
issue
comes
to
this
court
in
the
following
manner.
in
1959,
the
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
he
contended
in
this
petition
that
he
was
denied
due
process
of
law
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
in
support
of
his
contention,
he
alleged
the
following,
that
he
was
tried
in
the
criminal
court
of
record
in
polk
county,
florida
on
an
indictment
charging
him
with
"assault
to
murder
in
the
first
degree".
he
alleged
that
he
was
a
29-year-old
negro,
that
he
had
never
been
in
court
before,
that
he
did
not
understand
court
procedure
and
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
defend
himself
and
establish
his
innocence.
he
further
allege
in
his
petition
before
the
florida
supreme
court
that
he
requested
the
court
to
appoint
him
a
lawyer
and
that
in
response
to
that
request,
the
court
told
him,
"you
are
not
entitled
to
a
lawyer
as
this
is
not
a
capital
case
and
further,
you
won't
need
a
lawyer
in
this
case."
the
petition
also
alleges
that
a
request
was
made
for
a
copy
of
the
information
and
the
court
denied
the
request.
it
goes
on
to
allege
that
the
state
picked
the
jury
in
the
case,
that
the
information
was
read
and
that
the
trial
had
commenced.
when
the
trial
was
over,
petitioner
was
convicted
of
"assault
to
murder
in
the
second
degree"
and
a
20-year-sentence
was
imposed
upon
him.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
trial
took
one
day,
your
honor.
we
cannot
tell
from
the
record
whether
it
was
a
morning
and
afternoon
or
just
a
morning
but
it
began
and
ended
on
the
day
it
started.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
of
the
state's
witnesses
is
12
pages,
your
honor.
mr.
sam
daniels
of
the
state's
witnesses.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
--
mr.
sam
daniels
there
were
two
questions
asked
of
the
first
witness
who
was
a
negro
as
was
petitioner.
the
third
question
that
the
petitioner
tried
to
ask,
the
court
stopped
him
saying
that
was
testifying
and
it
isn't
time
to
testify.
the
three
witnesses
who
followed
were
law
enforcement
officials,
two
policemen
and
a
sheriff.
after
the
first
law
enforcement
official
testified,
the
court
asked
the
petitioner
if
he
had
any
questions
and
he
said,
"no,
sir.
no,
sir."
he
asked
no
questions
of
the
remaining
two
enforcement
officials
either.
so
--
mr.
sam
daniels
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
it
contains
a
partial
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings.
the
state
filed
a
return
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
in
that
return,
it
denied
the
allegations
of
the
petition.
i
use
the
word
"denied"
loosely
because
it
said,
"we
deny
that
the
petitioner
was
denied
his
constitutional
rights
by
the
alleged
refusal
to
furnish
counsel,"
and
then
went
on
to
argue
that
it
was
noncapital,
that
he
did
a
very
fine
job
of
representing
himself
and
that
the
trial
judge
protected
it.
mr.
sam
daniels
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
sam
daniels
they
are
nonexistent
so
far
as
we
know.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
--
mr.
sam
daniels
we
have
to
take
the
allegations
of
the
petition
as
to
what
took
place
as
to
the
period
of
time
before
the
first
witness
testified.
the
allegations
were
in
the
petition
concerning
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel,
the
failure
to
furnish
the
information
and
the
failure
to
furnish
the
list
of
the
witnesses,
also,
the
allegation
that
the
state
picked
the
jury.
then
the
trial
transcript
comes
into
play
and
the
first
word
of
the
transcript
is
the
first
word
of
the
testimony
of
the
prosecuting
witness.
the
transcript
closes
after
the
petitioner
has
been
asked
to
argue
his
case
in
final
argument
and
the
judge
told
him,
"you
may
plead
your
case,"
and
he
answered,
"well,
sir,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
that."
then
there's
a
notation
that
the
state
argued.
the
court
then
asked
the
petitioner
if
he
wanted
to
reply
to
the
state
and
he
said,
"no,
sir."
that's
the
end
of
it.
we
do
not
know
what
the
judge
charged
the
jury
and
there's
no
formal
recitation
of
anything
--
mr.
sam
daniels
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
the
testimony,
according
to
the
court
reporter's
certificate
which
is
attached
to
the
original
in
this
court,
testify
--
or
certifies
that
that
is
the
transcript
of
the
trial
testimony
at
the
trial.
there's
no
suggestion
that
any
witness'
testimony
has
been
left
out.
mr.
sam
daniels
no,
sir,
your
honor,
except
the
defendant
himself.
mr.
sam
daniels
he
did
take
the
stand.
mr.
sam
daniels
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
his
test
--
mr.
sam
daniels
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
pages
--
mr.
sam
daniels
well,
it
started
out
he
looked
at
the
judge
or
he
asked
the
judge,
"is
he
going
to
ask
me
questions?"
and
the
judge
said,
"no,
just
tell
your
side
of
it."
so
he
testified
--
during
his
testimony,
he
offered
the
statement
of
his
doctor
who
had
treated
him
for
his
mental
illness.
and
the
court
told
him
that
the
statement
would
not
be
admissible
that
he
could
call
the
doctor
as
a
witness.
the
document
there
never
got
into
evidence.
he
--
the
gist
of
his
testimony
was
that
he
had
head
injuries
in
the
army
in
1952
but
in
1956,
he
was
locked
in
a
psychotic
ward
in
the
bay
pines
veteran's
administration
hospital
for
four
months
under
lock
and
key
that
finally,
his
mother
came
over
to
the
hospital,
signed
guardianship
papers
to
get
him
released
from
the
psycho
ward
and
that
he
then
returned
to
the
world
at
large.
13
months
after
his
release
from
the
psychotic
ward,
the
alleged
offense
took
place.
mr.
sam
daniels
a
denial
of
the
defense
of
insanity?
mr.
sam
daniels
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
defense
--
mr.
sam
daniels
yes,
sir.
mr.
sam
daniels
i
want
to
give
a
careful
answer
to
your
honor's
question
as
i
realize
its
significance.
i
would
say
two
things.
the
testimony
of
the
petitioner
is
that
he
doesn't
remember
any
of
the
events
that
took
place
from
the
time
that
he
had
an
argument
in
this
juke
joint
with
the
prosecuting
witness
until
he
is
found
barricaded,
so
to
speak,
in
a
building
with
a
shotgun.
he
does
not
know
what
happened.he
testified
that
his
mind
is
a
complete
blank.
now,
he
uses
some
language
talking
about
these
events
but
while
he
is
in
custody
under
arrest,
the
testimony
is
that
the
officers
told
him
and
their
language
is,
"what
had
happened
and
what
he
had
did."
the
case
is
one
that's
susceptible
of
several
interpretations
and
some
very
real
and
substantial
issues
for
the
jury.
one,
would
be
the
defense
of
insanity
which,
due
to
his
ineptness,
he
couldn't
raise,
two,
the
question
of
whether
he
--
mr.
sam
daniels
both,
i
would
say,
your
honor.
the
second
possibility
is
that
he
never
committed
anything
at
all
that
was
a
violation
of
state
law.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
mystery
and
intrigue
in
this
record
even
--
although
it's
a
one-sided
recorded
and
i
think
better
described
as
a
shambles
than
a
trial
in
an
american
court.
the
--
there
are
many
things
unexplained.
three
or
at
least
two
officials
looked
for
the
shell
that
was
supposedly
fired
on
the
night
of
this
occurrence.
the
shell
was
never
found.
there
are
a
number
of
things.
the
people
who
supposedly
were
hit
never
testified
at
the
trial.
no
one
was
killed.
the
gist
of
the
state's
case
was
that
the
petitioner
took
a
blast
with
a
shotgun
at
14
feet
at
the
prosecuting
witness
and
missed
him.
his
testimony
for
that
was
that
wasn't
probable
or
possible,
that
he
was
an
expert
marksman
in
the
army
and
that
if
he'd
meant
to
kill
anybody
at
14
feet
with
a
shotgun,
he
could
not
possibly
have
missed.
the
second
type
of
defense
goes
to
the
amount
of
the
sentence
imposed.
when
we
talk
of
the
substantive
issues
at
the
trial,
we
will
find
that
there's
a
20-year
sentence
as
the
maximum
in
florida
for
any
type
of
assault.
and
that
that
takes
a
felonious
intent
to
kill
coupled
with
the
assault.
absent
that
intent
to
kill,
the
maximum
sentence
is
five
years.
so
there
is
a
15-year
difference
in
punishment
and
petitioner,
without
any
credit
for
good
time,
would
be
about
ready
for
release
if
he
could've
established
the
proposition
of
no
intent
to
kill.
mr.
sam
daniels
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
judge
made
an
explanatory
statement
to
him
and
said
"pleadous"
he
was
called.
if
you
had
a
lawyer
at
this
time,
he
would
make
the
opening
address
to
the
jury.
the
state
would
reply,
and
then
you
would
have
a
closing
argument.
if
you
wish
to
argue
then
plead
your
case.
his
answer
to
that
was,
"well,
sir,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
that."
the
judge
then
said,
"alright,
suppose
you
sit
here
and
listen
to
the
state,
pay
careful
attention
then
get
up
and
say
anything
you
want
to
in
reply."
the
record
notes
that
the
state
argued
and
after
that,
the
petitioner
was
asked
if
he
wished
to
reply
and
he
said,
"no,
sir."
on
that
note,
the
trial
ends.
mr.
sam
daniels
no,
sir,
your
honor.
we
do
not
know
what
was
charged.
we
can
speculate
that
since
he
was
charged
with
"assault
to
murder
in
the
first
degree"
and
convicted
of
"assault
to
murder
in
the
second
degree"
that
there
was
a
charge
which
did
go
into
the
question
of
degrees
and
possible
offenses.
but
the
--
mr.
sam
daniels
it
carried
a
20-year
penalty,
as
did
the
offense
for
which
he
was
convicted.
the
opinion
below
notes
that
he
effectively
defended
himself
to
the
event
that
he
secured
a
conviction
for
a
crime
in
lesser
degree.
mr.
sam
daniels
it
is
identical
--
mr.
sam
daniels
--
and
he
got
the
maximum.
mr.
sam
daniels
i'm
sure
that
as
he
sits
there
facing
another
17
years,
the
difference
between
first
and
second
degree
does
not
interest
him
in
the
slightest.
the
return
which
was
filed
contained
this
documentary
evidence
that
we
are
discussing,
namely
this
partial
transcript
of
the
trial
testimony.
in
addition
to
the
testimony
of
the
prosecuting
witness,
three
law
enforcement
officials
testified
at
the
trial.
these
officials
testified,
number
one,
two
of
them
to
finding
the
petitioner
at
a
building
across
the
street
from
this
juke
joint
in
the
circumstances
under
which
they
found
him
and
they
also
testified
as
to
admissions
made
by
the
petitioner
while
he
was
under
arrest.
one
of
the
arresting
officers
stated
that
the
petitioner
confessed
regret
and
said
that
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
hit
the
boy,
that
he
had
ended
up
getting,
that
he
meant
to
kill
scurry.
now,
there
were
two
scurry
brothers
involved
in
this
case
and
the
prosecutor
asked
him,
"which
scurry?"
and
he
testified,
"both
scurrys".
the
second
arresting
officer
testified
that
he
--
admitted
that
he
intended
to
kill
scurry
but
there's
no
elaboration
as
to
which
scurry
was
involved.
the
plaintiff's
testimony,
as
i
have
indicated,
took
the
position
that
he
did
not
know
what
had
happened.
secondly,
that
he
couldn't
--
could
not
have
intended
to
kill
anyone
and
it
also
went
into
the
question
of
his
mental
background.
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
contradiction
in
this
record
as
to
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
locked
in
a
psycho
ward,
that's
the
language
used
in
the
record,
for
a
period
of
four
months.
based
on
this
record,
the
florida
supreme
court
rendered
its
opinion
in
july
1
of
last
year
holding
that
the
writ
should
be
denied
and
that
the
petitioner
had
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
to
warrant
any
further
inquiry
into
the
process
which
culminated
in
his
conviction.
the
opinion
stated,
first,
that
as
to
the
request
for
an
information,
there
was
no
showing
that
such
a
request
was
made,
that
there
was
a
waiver
of
any
right
to
get
a
copy
of
the
charges
against
him
by
failure
to
make
timely
request
and
third,
that
the
error,
if
any,
was
harmless.
as
to
the
right
to
counsel,
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
first,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
of
the
trial
to
show
that
there
was
a
request
made
for
counsel,
that
there
is
no
duty
upon
the
trial
judge
to
make
inquiry
as
to
the
defendant's
desires.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
charge
was
simple,
so
was
the
evidence
to
support
it
and
that
this
petitioner
was
fully
able
to
defend
himself.
and
it
concluded
with
language
to
the
effect
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
issues
are
so
complex
or
the
petitioner
is
so
young
and
inexperienced,
as
to
bring
into
play
the
exception
to
the
rule
requiring
appointment
only
in
capital
cases
where
there
are
these
special
circumstances.
that
--
mr.
sam
daniels
there
is
a
minute
book
notation
attached
to
the
state's
return
in
the
court
below
which
state
that
the
defendant
was
arraigned
on
a
date
not
specified,
that
he
admitted
identity
and
pled
not
guilty.
that
is
the
sum
in
substance
of
the
record.
mr.
sam
daniels
that
he
was
elijah
mcneal.
i'm
--
mr.
sam
daniels
and
pled
not
guilty.
that's
the
extent
of
it.
mr.
sam
daniels
in
testing
the
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
if
we
follow
existing
law,
we
go
to
the
line
of
cases
inaugurated
with
betts
versus
brady
in
1942.
in
the
betts
case,
the
court
set
out
the
rule
which
has
been
applied
in
full
force
and
with
bigger
since
1942.
by
1952,
your
honors
could
remark
in
palmer
versus
ashe
that
you
had
repeatedly
held
that
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
assistance
of
counsel
whenever
there
are
special
circumstances
that
made
trial
without
counsel
unfair.
the
same
rule
was
applied
in
cash
versus
culver
in
the
last
term
and
hudson
versus
north
carolina
of
this
term.
turning
to
the
special
circumstances
involved
in
this
record,
we
do
not
have
in
the
record
a
great
deal
of
evidence
on
which
to
discuss
the
question
of
ignorance.
we
have
the
allegation
which
is
not
disproven
that
he
had
never
been
in
court
before,
that
he
did
not
understand
court
procedure
and
that
he
did
not
know
how
to
defend
himself
and
establish
his
innocence.
mr.
sam
daniels
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
proceedings
thereafter
are,
first,
by
returns
--
mr.
sam
daniels
then
after
that,
the
--
as
in
cash's
case
--
mr.
sam
daniels
--
on
remand,
they
sent
the
case
to
a
circuit
judge
to
hold
a
hearing.
mr.
sam
daniels
that
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sam
daniels
that
is
absolutely
correct.
in
this
case,
their
holding
was
that
there's
not
enough
here
to
require
any
inquiry.
but
we
have
the
uncontradicted
allocation
for
the
purposes
of
the
record
that
--
mr.
sam
daniels
and
the
exhibit.
mr.
sam
daniels
that's
the
record
--
mr.
sam
daniels
that
is
correct.
if
we
go
back
to
their
exact
language
on
the
matter,
they
said,
"so
it
cannot
accurately
be
said
that
the
issues
were
so
complex
or
the
petitioner
is
so
young,
ignorant
and
inexperienced
as
to
bring
into
play
the
exception
to
the
rule
requiring
appointment
of
counsel
only
in
capital
cases
and
to
require
further
inquiry
into
the
process
culminating
in
his
conviction."
mr.
sam
daniels
what
it
means
is
this
complaint
didn't
state
a
cause
of
action
and
it's
dismissed
with
prejudice.
the
allegations
of
ignorance
and
a
lack
of
understanding,
we
submit,
are
conclusively
shown
by
the
shambles
that
the
petitioner
made
of
his
defense
and
there
is
no
contradiction
about
what
happened.
it
is
there.
the
only
question
is
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
it.
the
first
thing
that
the
petitioner
did,
he
let
the
state
pick
the
jury.
i
submit
that
that
would
be
reversible
error
in
any
case
or
any
--
mr.
sam
daniels
he
took
no
part
in
the
voir
dire.
the
allegation
of
the
petition
which
is
not
disproven
by
the
record
is
that
the
state
picked
the
jury.
mr.
sam
daniels
there
is
no
allegation
or
evidence
as
to
whether
the
judge
participated.
the
allegation
is
the
state
picked
the
jury.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
record
is
silent
because
all
of
these
things
happened
before
the
state's
transcript
attached
to
its
current
--
mr.
sam
daniels
that
is
correct.
now,
turning
to
the
things
that
aren't
allegations
but
are
uncontroverted
facts,
the
petitioner
did
not
possess
sufficient
intelligence
to
cross-examine
witnesses.
he
asked
two
questions
of
the
negro
who
was
the
prosecuting
witness.
his
third
question
was
a
testimony
question
and
that
was
the
last
question
that
he
ever
asked
at
the
trial.
i
submit
that
a
southern
negro
would
not
likely
cross-examine
law
enforcement
officials
in
bartow,
florida
even
if
he
could
but
the
fact
is
that
he
did
not.
secondly,
he
never
made
a
single
objection
to
anything
that
happened
during
his
entire
trial.
we
will
come
to
some
of
the
things
that
he
could
have
objected
to
but
basically,
he
was
convicted
by
a
barrage
of
unresponsive
answers,
conclusions
of
the
witnesses
and
leading
questions
--
questions
rephrased
by
the
prosecution
to
suit
their
theory
rather
than
the
witness'
own
testimony.
mr.
sam
daniels
bartow,
florida
is
in
the
center
of
the
state,
your
honor.
the
only
attempt
that
the
petitioner
made
to
get
any
kind
of
documentary
evidence
in
failed
and
that
was
a
doctor's
statement
as
to
his
mental
illness
in
the
fact
of
his
psychotic
confinement.
he
did
not
know
the
rules
of
evidence
and
he
was
unable
to
get
the
document
in
evidence.
finally,
he
didn't
know
what
it
meant
to
plead
his
case.
the
great
force
and
final
argument,
the
great
event,
the
climax
of
a
jury
trial
and
here
is
your
petitioner
who
has
to
tell
the
judge,
"well,
sir,
i
don't
quite
understand
the
meaning
of
that."
that
was
the
extent
of
his
intelligence.
when
we
add
to
what
is
shown
as
to
what
he
could
not
do
and
what
went
over
his
head
and
buy
him
because
he
did
not
know
what
happened,
the
fact
of
his
psychotic
confinement,
we
respectfully
submit,
that
the
trial
of
this
unrepresented
petitioner
without
more
in
any
kind
of
a
case
would
be
a
shocking
denial
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
uveges
case,
palmer
versus
ashe
and
massey
versus
moore,
all
emphasize
the
question
of
ignorance
and
mental
deficiency
and
even
insanity.
this
is
not
just
any
case.
and
it
is
our
second
line
of
attack
that
no
layman
could
defend
himself
against
the
issues
that
were
involved
in
this
case.
florida
law
is
a
maze
of
nightmare.
these
distinctions
when
we
get
to
the
law
of
assault.
to
understand
what
the
petitioner's
substantive
issues
were,
we
have
to
consider
the
interplay
between
first,
the
law
of
assault,
second,
the
law
of
intent
and
third,
the
law
of
homicide.
and
it's
all
jumbled
up
into
degrees
and
distinctions.
now,
these
are
not
academic
distinctions.
these
are
distinctions
that
mean
a
difference
in
15
years
in
the
penitentiary.
all
that
the
petitioner
had
to
show
at
his
trial
was
that
he
had
no
intent
to
kill
whoever
was
charged
--
he
was
charged
with
killing
any
information.
we
don't
know
because
the
information
is
not
in
the
record.
but
if
he
could
have
proved
that,
he
would
have
had
a
maximum
of
a
five-year
sentence.
we
have
quoted
the
florida
cases
in
language
in
our
brief
but
the
specific
charge
is
assault
with
intent
to
commit
felony.
that's
the
statutory
crime.
i
intend
--
let
me
say
at
this
time
that
the
positive
proof
of
the
complexity
of
the
substantive
issues
in
this
trial
is
the
dramatic
fact
that
the
petitioner
stands
convicted
today
of
an
offense
which
does
not
exist
under
florida
law.
the
jury
verdict
which
came
in
stated
that
he
was
guilty
of
"assault
to
murder
in
the
second
degree".
the
statutory
offense
is
"assault
with
intent
to".
the
jury
verdict
left
out
the
"with
intent"
finding
and
there
never
has
been
a
finding
in
this
case
that
the
petitioner
had
the
intent
which
got
him
over
the
five-year
hurdle
into
the
15-year
hurdle.
the
supreme
court
and
the
state
knows
that
the
offense
is
assault
with
intent
because
in
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion,
that's
what
it
calls
it,
"assault
with
intent".
in
respondent's
return
they
used
language
"assault
with
intent".
the
jury
did
not
find
it.
if
counsel
had
been
present
and
had
asked
for
a
reconsideration
with
instruction
that
the
jury
had
not
found
a
lawful
verdict,
we
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
come
in
with
five
years
or
15
years
but
all
of
this
passed
unnoticed.
the
judge
gave
him
the
maximum
--
mr.
sam
daniels
--
20
years
--
mr.
sam
daniels
the
jury
verdict
is
quoted,
your
honor,
in
the
exhibit
which
is
attached
to
the
return,
which
is
the
judgment
of
conviction.
it's
on
page
22
of
the
record.
it
says
"the
above
cause,
having
come
on
to
be
heard,"
and
so
on,
"and
the
jury
having
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
on
february
26,
1958
to
the
offense
of
assault
to
murder
in
the
second
degree."
there
is
no
"with
the
intent
to
murder
in
the
second
degree"
in
there
and
i
would
add
--
i
believe
this
is
true
in
all
states
but
when
a
judge
makes
a
statement
of
fact
in
his
order
in
florida,
that
is
the
record.
if
counsel
says
--
mr.
sam
daniels
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
sam
daniels
the
state
did
not
attach
the
verdict
itself
to
--
mr.
sam
daniels
the
practice
is
not
uniform
under
--
i
--
i
say
that
only
because
of
french
versus
state
which
i
have
cited.
it
says
that
the
law
is
that
if
they
return
a
general
verdict
of
guilty,
then
you
don't
have
any
problem
about
something
having
been
left
out.
but
if
they
return
a
specific
finding
and
if
one
of
the
elements
required
for
the
crime,
such
as
intent,
is
left
out,
then
it's
said
that
the
verdict
may
be
insufficient
to
support
a
conviction.
i
concede
that
the
french
case
is
dicta
but
we
can
only
look
to
what
there
is
in
the
florida
law
and
what
it
says.
and
it's
the
only
expression
on
it
is
that
if
the
verdict
leaves
out
the
requisite
of
intent,
that
it
may
be
invalid.
mr.
sam
daniels
well,
we
do,
i
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
because
the
judge
used
that
language,
the
language
"assault
to
murder
in
the
second
degree".
and
the
judge's
finding
of
fact,
as
stated
in
his
order,
is
a
proper
part
of
the
record
in
the
state
of
florida.
if
the
judge
says
that
"so-and-so
appeared
before
me,"
that's
a
fact
and
the
record
shows
that
he
appeared.
mr.
sam
daniels
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
i
would
presume
that
in
varying
parts
of
the
state,
different
practices
prevail.
i
can
say
that
in
civil
trials,
the
judge
does
submit
different
forms
of
verdict.i
do
not
know
whether
the
criminal
practice
is
uniform
or
not,
your
honor.
but
the
--
mr.
sam
daniels
the
--
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
they
are
written
and
what
happens
is
that
the
court
reporter
doesn't
bother
to
take
down
which
--
what
is
actually
said.
they
just
depend
when
they
make
a
full
record
the
written
charges
for
the
type
of
the
charge
because
the
judge
grafted
it.
that
is
the
--
mr.
sam
daniels
that
is
correct.
now,
by
that,
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
they
use
the
same
identical
charge
in
every
case.
the
judge
will
juggle
it
around
but
you'll
have
standard
instructions,
your
right
is
charged
out,
then
the
court
reporter
won't
bother
to
take
it
as
he
reads
it
but
will
use
the
written
charge.
mr.
sam
daniels
there
are
a
number
of
things,
your
honor,
that
i
cannot
understand
in
this
case.
one
is
why
the
verdict
is
not
in
the
record,
two
is
why
the
information
is
not
in
the
record,
three,
why
the
county
solicitor's
argument
is
not
in
the
record
and
four,
why
the
charge
to
the
jury
is
not
in
the
record.
i
--
i
cannot
explain
but
perhaps,
the
state
could
prepare
the
record
and
answer
that
question
momentarily.
mr.
sam
daniels
your
honors
have
two
possible
sources
of
relief,
if
anything
is
done
for
the
petitioner.
one
is
to
remand
it
to
florida
with
direction
to
hold
a
hearing.
the
other
is
to
remand
it
to
florida
with
directions
to
award
petitioner
a
new
trial.
the
answer
as
to
the
latter
depends
on
whether
a
reading
of
the
trial
record
which
his
furnished
by
the
state
convinces
that
the
man
was
utterly
incapable
of
defending
himself.
we
certainly
submit
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
which
shows
what
happened
at
his
trial,
that
a
hearing
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
is
a
waste
of
time.
we
know
that
he
couldn't
question.
we
know
that
he
didn't
know
what
it
meant
to
argue.
we
know
that
he
sat
by
and
got
convicted
on
inadmissible
and
extremely
prejudicial
testimony
and
under
the
hudson
case,
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
enough.
i
think
the
hudson
case
is
specifically
written
to
single
shot
the
proposition
that
a
problem
of
trial
strategy,
such
as
being
left
after
one
codefendant
pleads
guilty,
is
beyond
the
kin
of
the
layman.
in
this
case,
i
think
that
the
admissions
of
the
arresting
officers
which
were
admitted
is
on
exactly
the
same
par.
now,
under
florida
law,
the
admissions
of
an
accused
made
to
arresting
officers
cannot
be
admitted
in
evidence
unless
there
is
an
affirmative
showing
that
they
were
freely
and
voluntarily
made.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
--
mr.
sam
daniels
i
concede
that
but
the
fact
that
the
rules
of
law
in
florida
were
not
applied
in
a
criminal
trial
shows
the
prejudice
of
the
absence
of
counsel.
in
parker
versus
ellis,
there
are
--
mr.
sam
daniels
i
think
that
there
is
a
partial
presumption
at
least
that
counsel
know
what
they're
doing
and
if
they
don't
wish
to
appear
overly
technical
to
a
jury,
that
may
be
the
smartest
thing
they
can
do.
but
this
petition
--
mr.
sam
daniels
i
--
mr.
sam
daniels
i
do
not
say
that
it
is.
i
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
factors
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
there
were
special
circumstances
warranting
counsel
in
a
noncapital
case.
i
--
mr.
sam
daniels
when
your
honors
appointed
me.
mr.
sam
daniels
your
honor,
i
think
there's
an
interesting
history
behind
that.
the
petition
that
was
filed
in
the
state
supreme
court
shows
some
signs
of
brilliance.
in
tracing
down
the
origin
of
it,
which
i
have
done
in
a
footnote,
there
are
paragraphs
of
identical
language
in
both
the
habeas
petition
below
and
in
mr.
langbein's
brief
here
in
cash
versus
culvert.
the
exact
language
is
used.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
can
look
and
you
can
see
the
quotation
marks
are
in
the
typing
where
the
prison
stenographer
even
left
a
little
quote
marks
in
--
in
quoting
from
mr.
langbein's
brief.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
but
(inaudible)
has
a
referred
bar.
they
also
have
a
library
when
each
one
of
their
inmates
has
some
sort
of
proceeding.
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
mr.
mcneal
did
not
grab
this
petition.
we
say,
in
our
brief,
that
it
was
prison
plagiarist
and
the
state,
in
rephrasing
our
contention,
says
that
it
was
eight
prison
plagiarists.
mr.
sam
daniels
cash,
i
can
tell
your
honors
two
things
that
i
know.
one
is
that,
on
a
hearing,
they
held
that
he
was
capable
of
defending
himself.
secondly,
they
held
on
a
second
hearing
that
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
get
counsel
of
his
own
choosing
and
remanded
his
case
for
trial.
what
has
happened
since
then,
i
don't
know.
but
mr.
cash
has
gotten
a
new
trial.
the
florida
law
regarding
the
fact
that
there
must
be
an
affirmative
showing
that
the
admissions
were
freely
and
voluntarily
made
is
so
strong
that
the
florida
law
places
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
trial
judge
to
go
into
the
question
even
if
counsel
does
not.
and
in
the
steiner
case,
they
have
a
discussion
of
the
fact
that
something
this
serious
ought
not
to
depend
on
skill
of
counsel,
that
courts
should
be
a
form
for
the
administration
of
justice
and
not
a
place
for
playing
chess
by
skilled
counsel.
so,
we
have
this
evidence
--
mr.
sam
daniels
that
is
the
steiner
case.
that's
steiner
versus
state.
the
citation
to
it
is
78
florida
647,
83
southern
565.
the
language
which
i
have
quoted
is
quoted
on
pages
22
and
23
of
my
brief.
the
interesting
thing
about
the
steiner
case
is
that
it
did
not
even
involve
admissions
to
police
officers.
it
just
involved
admissions
and
they
have
in
the
louette
case
the
statement
that
special
care
and
scrutiny
must
be
made
when
it's
the
arresting
officers
that
testified.
the
issue
arose
in
the
steiner
case
because
it
was
unobjected
to
at
the
trial
and
the
question
was
whether
they
could
consider
it
on
appeal
absent
such
objection.
they
held
that
the
trial
judge
had
an
affirmative
duty
to
make
inquiry
that
they
could
consider
it
and
they
did
consider
it
but
found
that
it
was
free
and
--
freely
and
voluntarily
made.
the
louette
case,
which
is
much
more
recent,
states
that
there
must
be
an
affirmative
showing
in
the
record
regarding
the
questions
of
threat,
force,
inducements
and
intimidation.
if
all
that's
shown
is
that
the
circumstances
where
those
questions
are
not
asked,
then
there's
an
affirmative
duty
to
reverse.
mr.
sam
daniels
no,
sir,
your
honor.
i
would
submit
that
there
are
some
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
from
this
record.
at
page
31
of
the
record,
we
have
some
discussion
of
the
circumstances
of
the
arrest.
"he
and
scurry
got
into
another
argument,"
and
so
on.
"who
was,
mcneal?"
answer,
"mcneal,
and
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
said,
"you'll
have
to
learn
better
than
that."
he
said,
"turn
me
loose.
i'm
not
scared
of
your
damn
pistol."
and
i
said,
"mcneal,
you're
going
with
me."
i
said,
"you're
still
under
arrest"
and
i
said,
"let's
go."
and
i
gave
the
other
boy
the
shotgun
to
keep.
i
didn't
know
what
was
in
mcneal's
mind
but
i
wanted
to
be
ready."
now,
drop
down
a
line
or
two.
"on
the
way
to
the
station,
we
told
mcneal
what
had
happened
and
what
he
had
did."
i
submit
that
the
prosecution
may
have
been
planning
siege
in
the
mind
of
this
petitioner
and
if
we
draw
any
inferences
about
the
free
and
voluntary
nature
of
his
admissions,
there's
some
evidence
in
this
case
that
he
was
dirt
brown
pretty
good.
there's
no
evidence
concerning
an
absence
of
threats
or
force
or
intimidation.
the
--
your
honors'
decision
in
williams
versus
kaiser
discusses
the
problems
that
a
layman
has
when
an
offense
involves
degrees.
now,
not
only
do
we
have
all
the
degrees
of
homicide
and
all
the
types
of
assaults
in
this
case
but
we
also
have
the
law
of
intent.
and
of
course,
we
have
the
possible
question
of
insanity.
it
is
our
position
that
there's
been
a
gross
violation
of
the
special
circumstances
rule
in
this
case
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
reversed.
mr.
sam
daniels
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
sam
daniels
the
counsel
for
respondent
has
taken
the
position
that
the
florida
rule
as
to
voluntariness
of
admissions
is
not
a
rule
as
to
admissions
but
as
only
as
it
applies
to
confessions.
at
page
18
of
our
brief,
we
quote
from
the
louette
case
and
the
second
paragraph
of
it
discusses
incriminating
admissions.
the
rule
clearly
applies
to
admissions.
if
we
turn
over
to
the
page
22
of
our
brief,
the
same
thing
is
said.
the
language
has
used
"admissions
or
confessions".
the
admission
in
this
case
was
not
only
concerning
the
fact
that
somebody
was
shot
but
the
crucial
element
in
the
admissions
was
the
intent
to
kill.
that's
what
they
needed
in
this
record
and
that's
what
they
got
from
these
three
police
officers
that
he
intended
to
kill
scurry.
now,
on
one
moment,
the
counsel
for
respondent
says
that
since
he
got
up
and
testified
that
"i
meant
to
scare
him"
that
he
admitted
in
crime
of
second
--
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
second
degree
murder.
that
isn't
correct.
the
williams
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
says
that
no
one
can
be
punished
under
the
assault
with
intent
to
commit
felony
statute
unless
there
is
an
intent
to
kill,
that
the
gist
of
the
offense
is
intent
to
kill.
the
scaring
testimony
would
be
a
five-year
offense
at
most
and
he
did
not
confess
to
that.
i
won't
go
into
the
record
but
i'll
leave
respectfully
with
your
honors
the
fact
that
after
he
said,
"i
meant
to
scare
them,"
the
prosecution
came
in
and
said,
"you
said
you
meant
to
scare
them?"
and
he
said,
"i
must
have
meant
to
scare
them."
but
this
goes
back
to
the
words
that
were
put
in
his
mouth
by
the
prosecu
--
by
the
arresting
officers
who
had
to
tell
him
what
he
had
done
on
the
night
of
the
offense.
now,
counsel
takes
the
position
that
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
cash
because
cash
was
only
a
habeas
corpus
posi
--
petition.
the
facts
in
the
cash
case
were
true
only
in
the
pick
wiki
in
a
sense
of
a
habeas
corpus
allegation
but
the
thing
that
makes
this
case
such
a
monstrous
front
to
the
due
process
clause
is
that
the
--
these
facts
are
proven
to
be
true.
here
is
a
record
furnished
by
the
state
which
shows
what
happened
to
this
man,
shows
that
we
did
have
an
ignorant
and
mentally
unbalanced
man
that
was
put
to
trial
in
a
complicated
case
that
could
not
defend
himself.
these
aren't
allegations.
these
are
facts
proven
by
the
state.
the
claim
is
made
that
the
petitioner
furnished
the
record
to
the
state
in
this
case.
the
fact
finding
power
of
those
in
prison
is
rather
limited
and
i
would
call
your
honors'
attention,
first,
to
page
24
of
the
record
which
describes
the
transcript
of
testimony
as
exhibit
d
attached
to
the
respondent's
return.
the
state
of
florida
prepared
this
record
and
it
is
shown
that
that
is
the
fact
that's
attached
to
their
return.
now,
petitioner
was
so
upset
when
he
received
this
return
in
raiford
without
a
copy
of
the
trial
testimony
that
he
filed
the
motion
in
the
supreme
court
of
florida
which
is
contained
at
page16
of
the
record.
and
he
says,
"the
state
has
filed
a
return.
they
had
exhibit
c
and
d,
including
the
trial
testimony
and
i
didn't
get
a
copy
of
it
and
i
can't
make
any
reply
to
the
return
because
i
don't
have
a
copy
of
it."
not
only
did
the
petitioner
not
prepare
the
record
but
he
wasn't
sure
it
was
a
copy
of
the
record
until
some
later
date.so
i
think
all
of
the
discussion
that
was
had
about
how
this
petitioner
prepared
the
record
is
beyond
me.
this
record
was
prepared
by
the
state
and
it
was
not
served
on
petitioner
inquiries
and
until
some
further
proceedings
were
taken.
mr.
sam
daniels
yes,
sir.
the
contention
is
made
that
the
claimed
right
to
counsel
is
a
pure
afterthought
in
a
mere
makeweight
argument
thrown
in
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
below.
if
your
honors
will
examine
pages
7
to
14
of
this
printed
record,
which
is
half
of
the
petition
itself,
you
will
find
rather
eloquent
language
of
a
good
prison
lawyer
discussing
vigorously
the
right
to
counsel,
citing
all
of
the
cases
that
we're
talking
about
today
using
the
fine
language
of
mr.
langbein
in
the
cash
case.
this
is
not
an
afterthought.
the
suggestion
that
the
florida
practice
is
to
furnish
counsel
and
so
on
leads
me
to
ask
this.
if
it's
so
customary
to
appoint
counsel
in
florida,
why
is
it
that
admittedly
half
of
the
habeas
corpus
petitions
in
the
state
come
from
the
fact
that
they
were
tried
without
counsel?
as
to
the
fact
that
mcneal's
cross-examination
was
so
brilliantly
conducted,
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
cold
facts
of
the
record
at
page
28.
he
wanted
to
argue
about
whether
the
prosecuting
witness
had
struck
him
or
whether
it
was
his
brother.
and
he
made
the
statement,
"you
said
you
hit
me
but
earnest
was
the
one
that
hit
me."
the
court
stopped
him
right
there
and
said,
"no,
that
is
testifying."
now,
that's
the
last
thing
that
the
petitioner
ever
said
at
his
trial
on
his
behalf
other
than
his
testimony.
now,
question
was
asked
concerning
the
judge's
help
and
how
judges
help
these
indigent
and
defenseless
prisoners.
that
page
right
there
shows
how
much
the
judge
helped
him.
if
we
read
the
questions
that
the
judge
did
ask,
he
didn't
ask
what
the
petitioner
was
trying
to
find
out.
he
didn't
ask
which
of
the
scurry's
hit
him.
he
didn't
do
that
at
all.
but
what
did
he
do?
he
extended
a
guiding
hand
to
the
prosecution
because
it
forgot
to
prove
its
element
of
premeditation.
it
forgot
to
ask
if
when
mcneal
was
first
in
the
"blue
chip",
he
had
a
shotgun
with
him.
is
the
trial
judge
helping
this
petitioner
when
he's
asked
of
the
witness,
"did
he
have
a
gun
or
anything
with
him
when
he
was
in
there
that
you
know
about?"
answer,
"no."
why
would
the
court
ask
that
question?
for
one
and
only
one
reason,
to
prove
that
mcneal
had
to
leave
the
café,
go
somewhere
and
get
a
shotgun
and
come
back.
that's
not
much
this
trial
judge
helped
this
petitioner.
and
i
defy
any
explanation
of
the
refusal
to
conduct
a
medical
examination
under
the
florida
statute
when
not
only
did
the
record
show
release
from
the
psychotic
ward
within
13
months
prior
to
the
commission
of
the
offense
but
through
one
extent,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
should
have
told
you
that,
at
page
42
of
the
record,
the
testimony
is
that,
while
he
was
discharged
13
months
ago,
he
still
went
back
to
the
hospital
to
get
pills.
that
is
the
record.
he
was
receiving
treatment
of
some
kind,
presumably
tranquilizers,
i
don't
know,
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
his
offense.
now,
it
is
argued
that
since
petitioner
had
enough
sense
to
stay
in
the
army
for
six
years,
then
he
had
enough
sense
to
conduct
his
own
defense
in
this
criminal
trial.
i
deny
the
validity
of
the
major
premise
and
also
point
out
that
we
do
not
know
when
his
head
injuries
were
received
with
reference
to
his
service
in
the
army.
if
his
head
injuries
were
received
upon
discharge,
then
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
army
would
mean
nothing.
as
to
what
being
a
gi
student
means
in
this
record,
i
do
not
know.
there
are
trade
schools
that
you
can
go
to
under
the
gi
bill.
i
suppose
you
can
go
to
high
school
or
any
other
school
on
it.
we
come
back
to
this
fundamental
proposition.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
have
to
sit
and
read
allegations
and
then
say
inquiry
must
be
made.
this
is
a
case
where
we
know
what
happened.
it's
proven
by
the
records
furnished
by
the
state
of
florida.
this
is
not
something
that
we
might
get
excited
about
in
the
future.
this
is
the
cold
brutal
facts
of
what
went
on
in
the
state
of
florida.
this
ignorant,
mentally
unbalanced
petitioner
was
tried
without
counsel
in
a
case
that
involved
extremely
complicated
issues
of
substantive
law
so
complicated
that
the
learned
attorney
general,
in
speaking
this
morning,
has
made
some
statements
which
we
are
in
a
position
to
deny
on
the
substantive
issues.
the
evidentiary
problems
are
complicated
enough
that
we're
even
arguing
them
here
before
your
honors
this
morning.
add
the
man
that
the
petitioner
was,
the
defense
which
he
could
not
make
but
so
desperately
needed
and
add
the
type
of
issues
that
were
involved
in
this
case
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
trial
below
in
the
state
of
florida
was
much
more
upfront
to
the
fundamental
dignities
of
mankind.
thank
you.
mr.
sam
daniels
thank
you,
your
honor.
