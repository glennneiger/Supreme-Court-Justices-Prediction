elijah
mcneal,
jr.,
petitioner,
versus

o.
culver,
the
state
prison
custodian.
mr.
daniels.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
was
the
transcript,
mr.
daniels?
chief
justice
earl
warren
12
pages.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
at
all,
mr.
daniels,
of
the
--
of
the
proceedings
in
the
court
at
the
time
of
arraignment
or
whenever
the
--
whenever
the
court
supposed
to
advise
a
man
of
his
rights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
admitted
identity
and
that
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
he
was
the
one
who
was
charged,
yes.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
showing
of
any
kind
in
this
case
either
by
--
by
the
district
attorney
--
through
the
district
attorney's
questioning
or
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
henderson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
the
petitioner
represented
by
counsel
in
--
before
your
state
supreme
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
it
more
complete,
i
wonder?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
why
it
is
not
more
complete.
why
is
there
no
charge?
why
is
there
no
information?
and
why
is
there
nothing
about
the
arraignment
in
this
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
say
that
because
the
very
first
item
in
number
one
in
his
petition
for
habeas
corpus
reads
"the
trial
court
deprived
him
in
his
rights
to
representation
by
counsel
as
required
by
decisional
rules
and
established
law
of
florida."
now,
that
isn't
just
incidental.
that's
the
very
first
and
primary
complaint
that
he
makes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
well,
in
your
--
in
your
state,
whether
he
has
those
attributes
or
not,
is
it
not
necessary
to
inform
him
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding
that
he's
entitled
to
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
not
necessary.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
record
ever
show
that
--
that
it
was
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
considered
a
ministerial
function
and
the
record
seldom
shows
it.
many
records
do.
it
depends
a
great
deal
on
the
court
reporter.
we
have
some
good
ones
and
we
have
some
court
reporters.
and
the
record
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
determined
what
was
to
be
in
the
record,
mr.
henderson,
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
ends
through
with
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
there
a
charge
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
it
particularly
important
in
a
case
like
this
where
you
have
many,
many
different
kinds
of
assault
in
the
--
in
the
state
of
florida
that
this
man
could
be
convicted
of
and
the
difference
in
the
great
disparity
in
punishment
between
--
between
those
different
kinds
of
assault?
wouldn't
it
be
very
important
for
--
for
the
court
to
know
whether
--
whether
in
the
absence
of
counsel,
the
--
the
jury
had
been
adequately
instructed
as
to
those
different
kinds
of
assault?
chief
justice
earl
warren
at
what
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
--
in
the
course
of
your
investigation
in
the
attorney
general's
office
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
case
that
should
be
--
be
heard,
wouldn't
you
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
man
was
not
represented
by
counsel,
either
in
this
proceeding
of
the
supreme
--
in
the
supreme
court
or
at
his
original
trial
and
that
the
--
the
question
of
whether
the
judge
had
adequately
instructed
the
jury
as
to
the
various
degrees
and
--
and
kinds
of
assault
was
an
important
factor
in
determining
whether
he
had
--
had
suffered
by
reason
of
being
deprived
of
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
you
have
told
me
that,
normally,
the
--
the
record
starts
with
the
first
witness
of
the
prosecution
and
ends
with
a
charge
but
the
charge
isn't
here.
and
--
and
as
the
petition
shows,
it
becomes
a
very
important
element
in
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
this
man
doesn't
--
as
i
understand
it,
doesn't
attempt
to
--
to
use
these
questions
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
appealing
and
getting
a
reversal
of
his
trial.
all
he
wants
to
show
is
the
effect
of
his
being
deprived
of
counsel
and
that's
entirely
different
thing,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
henderson,
may
--
may
i
ask
you
this
--
this
question.
what
in
the
--
you
say
that
he
furnished
you
--
he
--
petitioner
furnished
the
record
to
you
in
this
case.
will
you
tell
us
procedure
--
tell
him
--
tell
us
how
he
happen
to
come
by
the
record
and
how
he
furnished
it
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
can't
hear
you.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
henderson,
did
he
--
did
--
how
did
he
get
this
transcript
--
transcript
or
this
record,
whatever
it
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
--
did
he
have
to
pay
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
then,
he
--
he
got
it
by
asking
for
the
record.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
what
is
a
man
entitled
to
under
florida
law
when
he
asks
for
the
record
in
--
in
a
criminal
case
for
--
for
a
purpose
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
noticed
here
that,
in
this
one,
the
first
allegation
is
that
the
trial
court
deprived
him
in
his
rights
to
representation
by
counsel
as
required
by
decisional
rules
and
established
law
of
florida.
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
record
that
--
that
would
bear
on
that.
the
next
is
the
trial
court
deprived
him
of
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
and
i
would
assume
that
the
--
that
the
charge
would
be
a
part
of
--
part
of
the
trial
that
he
could
rely
on.
and
then
i
notice
also
that
the
trial
court
deprived
him
of
due
notice
by
refusing
to
furnish
him
a
copy
of
the
--
of
the
information.
i
don't
--
there's
nothing
in
there
about
the
information,
is
--
is
there?
now,
how
--
how
does
he
protect
himself
in
--
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
both
--
both
sides
would
--
would
be
protected
if
they
had
the
record
from
which
the
supreme
court
could
--
could
determine
what
the
fact
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
--
well,
why
isn't
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
--
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
he
was
out
on
bail
while
he
was
waiting
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
have
to
rely
on
some
--
some
finespun
theory
of
that
kind
as
to
whether
he
was
out
on
bail
or
not?
couldn't
--
wouldn't
your
records
of
your
court
show
whether
he
was
out
on
--
on
bail
or
not?
why
should
we
have
to
--
have
to
have
finespun
arguments
like
that
because
a
man
says
"i
work"?
well,
he
works
when
he's
out
of
jail
but
he
doesn't
work
when
he's
in
jail.
certainly,
your
records
ought
to
show
whether
the
man
was
admitted
to
bail
and
if
he
is
--
is
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
in
this
circumstance,
he
would
have
been
admitted
to
bail?
here's
--
here's
a
man
who's
undoubtedly
psychotic.
he's
been
in
a
--
in
a
safe
hospital
or
a
veteran's
administration
hospital
for
being
psychotic.
you
claimed
he
fired
a
shotgun
at
a
--
at
a
crowd
14
feet
distant
from
them.
is
--
is
there
an
inference
that
entitled
to
infer
from
that
that
he
was
admitted
to
bail
just
on
his
statement
that
"i
work"?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
know
what
the
record
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
look
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
you
think
you
should,
rather
than
to
--
to
make
an
argument
of
this
kind
that
you
infer
from
some
general
language
that
had
no
application
to
bail
at
all
that
he
was
on
bail?
don't
you
think
it
would
have
been
much
fair
to
this
man
to
--
to
look
at
the
records
of
the
court
and
find
out
if
he
had
been
placed
on
bail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
mean,
before
you
wrote
your
brief
in
this
--
in
this
court
and
before
you
--
you
took
the
position
that
you
now
take
that
there
is
an
inference
that
the
man
was
on
bail,
don't
you
think
it
would
have
been
fair
to
look
at
the
record
and
find
out
if
the
man
actually
was
on
bail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
judge
didn't
say
there
was
nothing
in
the
letter
that
would
help
him,
did
he?
he
said
that
if
he
wanted
to
get
that
into
the
evidence,
he
would
have
to
--
have
to
bring
the
doctor
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
henderson,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
while
ago
that
--
that
the
trial
or
the
evidence
against
him
was
32
--
covered
32
pages
of
the
transcript.
as
i
--
as
i
see
it
here,
there
are
four
witnesses
by
the
state
against
him
and
that
testimony
is
covered
in
its
entirety
by
12
pages
of
the
--
of
the
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
doesn't
go
that
far.
his
testimony
is
about
9
pages,
something
like
that
and
the
others
were
--
were
8
pages
and
the
rest
of
them
were
12
pages.
convict
a
man
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
convict
a
man
in
a
--
in
a
complicated
situation
of
that
kind
with
all
of
those
different
assault,
the
verdicts
that
could
be
given
and
to
take
only
--
only
12
pages
of
testimony
with
4
witnesses
and
have
them
end
up
--
end
up
with
20
years
in
the
penitentiary
is
a
--
is
a
rather
speedy
trial,
to
say
the
least,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
rule
in
your
state
so
far
as
the
judge
helping
a
man
who
is
not
represented
by
counsel?
is
there
no
statutory
or
--
or
judge-made
law
on
that
subject?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
did
the
judge
ask
any
questions
to
--
to
help
this
man
along
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
get
his
story
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
only
question
you
remember.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
one
other
thing.
i
understood
from
counsel
that
under
--
under
florida
law,
no
admission
could
be
--
can
be
received
in
evidence,
unless
there
is
--
it's
established
at
the
trial
that
is
voluntary
and
also,
i
understood
him
to
say
that
in
this
case,
neither
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge
asked
any
question
about
the
voluntariness
of
--
of
this
man's
statement
made
to
a
--
a
police
officer
and
that
there
is
a
case
in
your
supreme
court
which
holds
that
if
the
prosecutor
does
not
establish
the
voluntariness
of
it
by
his
questions,
that
it
devows
upon
the
judge
to
do
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
have
to
be
formally
a
confession
in
order
to
--
in
order
to
require
that
proof
of
voluntariness?
chief
justice
earl
warren
never
raised
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
admission?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
shot
one
of
them?
well,
that's
pretty
good
admission.
is
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
pretty
close
to
a
confession,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
henderson,
i
took
a
lot
of
your
time
to
question
--
asking
you
questions.
if
you
want
a
few
moments
to
--
to
sum
up
your
argument,
please
take
the
time
and
do
it.
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
daniels.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
daniels,
before
you
sit
down,
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
should
like
to
express
our
appreciation
for
the
fact
that
you
would
undertake
this
assignment
for
this
indigent
defendant
at
our
request.
we
are
always
comforted
when
lawyers
are
willing
to
perform
that
kind
of
public
service.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
mr.
henderson,
i
--
i
want
to
say
to
you,
sir,
that
we
have
--
we
appreciate
the
earnest
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
this
--
your
state.
