justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
you
understand
was
necessity
for
his
having
a
guardian?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
necessity
for
his
having
a
guardian?
he
testified
that
he
had
to
have
a
guardian
to
sign
all
of
his
papers,
in
other
words,
his
guardian.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
he
stayed
there
four
months.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
a
provision
for
guardianship
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
don't
know
whether
he
was
under
state
guardianship
by
his
--
for
his
mother
or
not
--
by
his
mother
or
not?
i
just
saw
the
statement
"i
had
to
have
a
guardian
to
sign."
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
offered
the
paper,
didn't
he,
to
show
whether
he
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
--
how
do
we
know
what
was
on
it?
is
anything
in
the
record
to
show
what
was
on
that
paper
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
by
that
doctor?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
he
said
is
that
it
was
a
statement
that
showed
he
had
blackouts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
have
occasion
to
have
blackouts.
that's
all
we
get
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
from
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
nothing
else
in
there
that
explains
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
and
the
fact
of
his
having
a
guardian.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
would
also
have
another
relevance,
would
it
not,
under
the
betts
and
brady
rule,
if
it
had
shown
that
he
was
subject
to
blackout
that
he
had
been
in
a
hospital
for
psychotic
trouble,
it
would
have
something
to
do
with
whether
the
record
entitled
him
to
a
hearing,
was
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
does
that
fully
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
he
was
of
such
a
psychotic
--
in
such
a
psychotic
condition
that
he
needed
a
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
--
talking
about
the
defense
of
himself.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
the
defense
on
the
ground
of
insanity.
i'm
talking
about
his
capacity
to
defend
himself.
would
--
it
was
not
entirely
or
was
it
entirely
relevant
or
relevant
at
all
if
he
was
psychotic?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
he
worked
sometimes.
his
answer
was
not
quite
so
strong,
you
see.
you
asked
him
if
he
worked,
he
said
sometimes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they
asked
him
where
and
he
said
at
this
nursery.
