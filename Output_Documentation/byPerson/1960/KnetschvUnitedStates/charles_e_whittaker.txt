justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
may
i
ask
you
(inaudible).
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
the
government
contend
that
this
was
a
tax
evasion
or
just
tax
avoidance.
do
you
argue
in
other
words
that
the
taxpayer
doesn't
have
to
comply
(inaudible)?
would
he
not
buy
a
recent
real
estate
by
not
paying
the
dollars
on
(inaudible)
then
one
gives
more
--
on
that
indebtedness
and
the
interest
is
deductible?
does
he
have
to
make
a
profit
out
of
it
or
anything?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please
sir
with
the
permission
of
the
chief
justice.
is
it
true
that
prior
to
the
1954
act,
the
commissioner
had
recognized
such
payments
as
interest
and
deductible?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then
next,
did
the
commissioner
seek
a
change
in
the
law,
seek
to
induce
congress
to
change
it
so
as
to
make
such
interest
payments?
i'm
using
that
phrase
for
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
nondeductible?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
to
clarify
it
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
to
make
--
all
right.
to
the
make
them
nondeductible?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
was
it
in
response
to
that
request
of
the
commissioner
that
the
1954
act
resulted?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
does
it
expressly
say
that
your
committee's
build
will
deny
an
interest
deduction
in
such
cases
but
only
as
to
annuities
purchased
after
march
1,
1954?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
how
do
you
get
away
from
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
the
commission
--
was
the
report
talking
about
some
other
type
of
transaction
or
about
this
very
type
of
transaction
in
this
report
which
is
quoted
at
page
20
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
page
2
of
his
reply
brief
saying
“it
has
come
to
your
committee's
detention
et
cetera?”
now
as
the
--
were
the
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
(voice
overlap)
with
this
very
situation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how,
if
i
may
ask,
mr.
mclane,
could
there
be
taxable
income
to
him
upon
the
forgiveness
of
debt
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
wasn't
any
debt,
was
there?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
forget
it.
i
could
find
it.
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time.
