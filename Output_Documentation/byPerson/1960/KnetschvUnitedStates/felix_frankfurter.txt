well,
if
you're
right
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
--
excuse
you
--
excuse
me
if
i
interrupted
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
are
right
about
that.
you
said
there
are
two
answer.
one,
this
is
not
intended?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
two
that
he
buys
the
tax
benefit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right
about
one,
you
don't
need
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you're
right
about
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
two
is
really
the
usual
make
of
gregory
and
helvering,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
isn't
--
but
helvering
--
he
said
these
no
longer
stand
for
the
proposition,
but
you
can't
be
very
contriving
in
getting
a
benefit
out
of
a
taxing
structure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
brought
in
the
dictum.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
reject
to
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
reject
that
and
many
relies
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
of
his
opinion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
first
rejects
it
and
then
relied
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you're
right
about
that
then
you
don't
have
to
say
this
is
a
--
if
this
is
a
sham
--
this
is
a
non-reality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
this
is
a
fiction.
if
this
is
an
artifact
whatever
word
you
use,
then
you
don't
have
to
say
you
can't
get
a
benefit
by
monkeying
around
with
the
tax
structure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
done
everyday
all
over
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
perfectly
honest
people
and
if
you
can
do
it
without
sham,
you
can
do
it,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
something
that
isn't
so
can't
be
cumulative,
something
that
is
nothing
isn't
cumulative?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
one
could
find
it
as
sham,
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
