justice
john
m.
harlan
that
describes
--
i
don't
know
if
this
is
of
any
significance
but
that
describes
your
situation,
precisely
except
for
one
element,
doesn't
it,
namely,
the
additional
borrowing
that
were
made
by
the
taxpayer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
it's
not
material.
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
the
code
of
1954,
was
this
specific
type
of
transaction
an
infrequent
one
or
was
it
--
or
there
are
lots
of
these
contracts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
if
you're
right
--
if
you
are
right
on
your
position
here,
i
would
suppose
the
injection
of
a
bank
into
this
situation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
diggs
case
in
the
second
circuit
involved
a
bank.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
regard
this
case
differently
from
the
government's
point
of
view
if
he
hadn't
had
his
loan-back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
going
to
deal
with
this
argument
that
even
under
this
--
the
way
this
was
dealt
with
that
he
stood
to
gain
no
tax
advantage?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
these
have
been
taken
out
by
a
very
young
man.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
would
have
stood
--
he
would
have
stood
to
get
his
annuity
contract
or
his
annuity
payments
at
the
end
of
30
years
or
he
wouldn't
have
profited.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
in
consequence
--
that's
in
consequence
of
the
continued
borrowing
back.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you
might
have
a
different
situation
i
would
think
if
--
on
your
premises
if
you
didn't
have
the
borrowing
back.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
says
he
doesn't
get
a
tax
benefit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
disagree
with
his
argument
on
that?
i
don't
want
to
go
through
the
rigamarole
of
the
--
because
frankly
i
have
--
in
the
lawsuit,
right?
but
do
you
claim
that
he
inevitably
does
get
a
tax
benefit
from
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean
if
these
deductions
were
allowed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
says
he
doesn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
gave
some
illustrations
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
puzzle
me
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wish
you
deal
with
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
can
you
answer
it
though?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
commissioner
asked
the
legislation
--
1954
legislation
be
made
retroactive?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
the
congress
didn't
do
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
the
commissioner's
proposal
to
congress
of
1954,
printed
many
of
these
papers?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
basis
of
your
answer
to
my
question
that
the
commissioner
did
specifically
proposed
retroactive
legislation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
let
me
--
one
put
his
fingers
on
what
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
documented?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
get
it
by
inference
or
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
regulation
commissioner
passed
1954?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
revenue
ruling.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
in
existence
before
congress
acted
on
the
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
can't
be
said
that
congress
had
that
before
the
time
it
enacted
this
legislation?
