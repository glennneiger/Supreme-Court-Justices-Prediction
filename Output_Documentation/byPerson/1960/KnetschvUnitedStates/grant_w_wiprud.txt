mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
if
the
court
please,
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
taxpayer
in
computing
his
net
taxable
income
for
the
years
1953
and
1954,
was
or
was
not
entitled
to
deduct
certain
amounts
which
he
claims
were
interest
payments
on
a
large
loan
from
sam
houston,
a
texas
insurance
company.
the
long-standing
statutory
provision
which
authorizes
interest
deductions
in
section
23
(b)
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
which
was
reenacted
without
change
so
far
as
here
pertinent
as
section
163
(a)
of
the
1954
code.
both
these
--
in
both
codes
the
provision
says
that
a
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
deduct
all
payments
of
interest
on
indebtedness.
now
this
court
has
been
at
panes
in
several
landmark
decisions
to
say
precisely
what
constitutes
interest
on
indebtedness
within
the
meaning
of
this
authorizing
provision.
the
two
principal
decisions
in
this
area
by
this
court
were
the
old
colony
railroad
company
case
and
deputy
versus
du
pont,
both
cited
and
quoted
in
our
brief.
suffice
it
here
to
say
that
in
both
of
those
decisions
this
court
took
the
view
that
not
every
enforceable
obligation
was
a
proper
predicate
for
interest
deductions
under
the
authorizing
provision.
that
to
be
deductible,
payments
purporting
to
be
interest
had
to
be
payments
for
the
use
of
borrowed
money.
and
this
court
observed
that
that
approach
to
the
meaning
of
the
term
interest
and
meaning
of
the
term
indebtedness
was
in
concord
with
the
usual
ordinary
everyday
usage
of
the
terms
interest
and
indebtedness
in
the
marketplace.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
taxpayer
never
really
borrowed
$4
million
from
sam
houston,
the
insurance
company.
indeed,
the
lower
courts
were
in
agreement
that
this
entire
transaction
while
in
form,
it
was
a
purchase
of
annuity
contracts
with
a
very
large
loan
from
the
very
insurance
company
issuing
the
contracts
was
devoid
of
commercial
substance
and
that
it
was
contrived
solely
in
order
to
enable
the
taxpayer,
so
he
hoped
to
purchase
tax
deductions.
and
that
this
was
the
only
possible
benefit
which
could
accrue
to
the
taxpayer.
now
the
taxpayer
in
assailing
this
result,
well
the
courts
therefore
concluded
necessarily
having
reached
that
view
of
the
facts,
that
this
was
not
interest
on
indebtedness
within
the
meaning
of
section
23
(b)
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
defined
that
provision.
now,
in
assailing
this
result
on
a
--
in
this
litigation,
the
taxpayer
doesn't
deal
directly
with
section
23
(b)
or
with
this
court's
definition
of
what
must
constitute
an
interest
to
be
deductible
under
that
provision.
rather,
he
places
his
reliance
upon
a
provision
of
the
1954
code
which
was
not
even
in
existence
when
he
entered
into
the
disputed
transaction,
a
provision
which
does
not
authorize
deductions
but
prohibits
deductions.
he
doesn't
say,
you
contend
that
the
terms
of
this
provision
which
is
a
prohibitory
rather
than
an
authorizing
provision
serves
to
get
him
to
home
plate
to
give
him
these
interest
deductions,
but
he
says
that
if
you
read
the
committee
report
which
underlies
this
amendment
to
the
1954
code,
that
then
the
only
possible
conclusion
is
that
congress
in
effect
as
i
understand
the
taxpayer's
argument
retroactively
legislated
to
modify
section
23
(b)
to
allow
the
kind
of
interest
deduction
that
this
taxpayer
is
claiming
here.
we
submit
that
this
approach
is
unsound
and
we
believe
that
in
order
to
demonstrate
this,
we
think
we
have
demonstrated
it
on
the
brief,
and
in
order
to
show
exactly
what
the
impact
of
this
1954
amendment
was,
i
think
that
the
--
the
--
it
is
necessary
first
to
see
exactly
what
was
done
in
form
and
what
in
substance
underlay
the
form
of
the
transaction.
now
in
form
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
well,
your
honor,
he
doesn't
deal
directly
with
this
court's
definition
of
interest
under
23
(b).
he
says
at
page
18
of
his
opening
brief,
indeed,
that
if
you
read
23
(b)
together
with
264
(a)
(2)
that
indeed
perhaps
the
government's
position
might
be
correct
that
it's
only
--
only
if
you
go
to
the
committee
report.
only
if
you
go
to
the
committee
report
that
you
could
take
the
view
that
23
(b)
extended
so
far
as
to
allow
what
we
believe
and
what
the
courts
have
held
to
be
a
purely
sham
and
contrived
transaction
which
took
place
here.
now
in
form,
this
transaction
involves
the
purchase
of
very
large
face
amounts
of
annuity
contracts
with
a
very
large
loan
from
the
insurance
company
issuing
the
contract.
the
face
amount
of
these
contracts
aggregated
$8,388,000.
this
was
supposed
to
be
the
guaranteed
cash
value
of
these
contracts
at
maturity.maturity
was
30
years
after
date
of
purchase.
the
taxpayer
was
60
when
he
purchased
them
so,
in
theory
at
any
rate,
if
he
lived
to
be
90
and
held
these
contracts,
enforced
until
he
was
90,
he
would
then
have
contracts
with
a
guaranteed
cash
value
of
$8
million
and
with
annuity
payments
from
age
90
of
$90,000
per
month.
in
purchasing
these
annuity
contracts,
there
was
an
exchange
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
insurance
company
of
obligations.
in
fact,
the
instruments
which
represent
this
exchange
were
integrated
instruments
which
expressly
refer
to
each
other.
the
insurance
company
issued
the
annuity
bonds
that
which
i
have
described,
and
the
annuity
bonds
themselves
recited
that
they
were
issued
at
consideration
of
cash
payments
by
the
taxpayer
aggregating
$4,000
and
the
execution
by
the
taxpayer
of
loan
notes
against
these
annuity
bonds
out
of
the
cash
value
of
the
annuity
bonds
of
$4
million.
in
short,
in
form
he
was
paying
one
tenth
of
1%
of
the
purchase
price
in
cash
and
executing
notes
against
the
loan
value
of
the
very
contracts
he
was
purchasing
for
the
remainder
99
plus
percent
of
the
purchase
price.
the
loans
that's
--
loan
of
$4
million
was
a
collateral
loan.
he
assigned
the
bonds
to
the
insurance
company
which
issued
them
forthwith
on
the
same
date
that
he
purchased
them.
the
obligation
to
repay
the
loan
of
$4
million
was
to
write
them
at
the
same
time
that
the
obligation
of
the
insurance
company
to
pay
the
annuity
amounts
was
to
write
them
under
the
annuity
contracts,
unless
he
--
his
indebtedness
under
the
loan
wherever
to
exceed
the
cash
or
loan
value
of
the
policies
and
the
loans
were
nonrecourse
loans.
therefore,
you
would
have
a
situation
where
at
the
outset
and
on
the
same
day,
annuity
contracts
in
very
large
face
amounts
are
issued
in
exchange
for
loan
notes,
of
course,
no
money
changes
hands
reciprocal
and
offsetting
obligations
are
set
up
both
to
ripen
30
years
from
date.
thirty
years
from
date,
the
insurance
company
guarantees
a
cash
value
and
30
years
from
date,
the
taxpayer
guarantees
to
pay
$4
million.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
there
is
quite
a
few
of
these,
your
honor.
there
were
so
far
as
we
know,
the
two
--
two
insurance
companies
which
specialize
in
this
kind
of
thing
were
the
sam
houston
company
99%
of
whose
resource
are
allocated
to
this
kind
of
contract
and
who
advertised
this
kind
of
thing
as
a
tax
sheltered
investment
in
the
wall
street
journal
and
other
trade
journals.
and
the
standard
insurance
company
of
indiana
which
promoted
variations
of
this
scheme
in
the
same
way.
there
are
a
lot
of
variations,
some
of
them
bring
in
window
dressing
in
the
form
of
a
temporary
bank
loan
which
is
--
it
exists
for
24
hours.
you'd
take
the
money
from
the
bank,
24
hours
later,
the
insurance
company
pays
the
taxpayer
the
amount
of
the
loan,
pays
the
bank
and
they
end
up
with
within
that
effect
very
like
that
here.
this
is
the
simplest
form
of
the
transaction
which
this
court
has
before
it,
where
you
simply
have
reciprocal
obligations
which
are
reflected
and
integrated
documents,
the
bonds
on
the
one
hand
and
the
annuity
loans
on
the
other.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
we
argue
that
it
was
of
no
consequence
in
the
--
in
the
cases
involving
that
which
weller
and
emmons
which
are
pending
here
on
petitions
for
cert
did
involve
temporary
bank
loans
and
the
third
circuit
agreed
with
us
that
taking
an
integrated
view
of
the
transaction
and
those
temporary
bank
loans
were
of
no
consequence.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
i
believe
he
ran
to
a
bank
too.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
after
the
taxpayers
in
the
sam
houston
company
had
set
this
transaction
up
in
this
fashion
with
no
appreciable
change
of
position
or
of
economic
obligations
on
either
side,
say
for
a
$4,000
cash
outlay
by
the
taxpayer
and
reciprocal
offsetting
obligations
under
the
fines
and
the
loan
notes.
the
taxpayer
proceeded
within
a
few
days
and
within
a
space
of
a
few
days
to
make
two
--
two
payments
which
were
labeled
as
prepayments
of
interest
on
the
loan.
the
first
one
in
fact
was
made
on
the
same
day
that
he
purchased
the
contracts
for
$140,000.
the
insurance
company
turned
around
and
then
augmented
his
indebtedness
to
the
company
by
$99,000
which
was
the
cash
or
loan
value
of
these
policies
at
the
end
of
the
first
contract
year
less
a
thousand
dollars
which
he
left
in
the
city.
and
at
the
same
time
then
the
taxpayer
turned
around
again
and
paid
prepaid
a
year's
interest
on
this
augmentation
of
$99,000.
so
that
as
of
the
end
of
1943,
he
had
purportedly
paid
out
a
$147,000,
a
down
payment
of
$4,000
at
the
outset
on
the
policies,
the
purchase
price
of
the
policies
and
$143,000
in
interest.
however,
since
the
insurance
company
had
concurrently
loaned
back
to
him
$99,000
as
an
augmentation
of
his
indebtedness
on
the
policies,
he
was
actually
out-of-pocket
at
considerably
smaller
sum
than
a
$147,000.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
no,
he
would
not,
your
honor,
but
we
think
that
it
is
cumulative
when
we
think
it's
a
very
strong
showing
generally
that
this
trans
--
transaction
was
completely
devoid
of
commercial
substance.
we
would
say
in
any
event,
that
given
the
way
in
which
they
set
it
up
where
this
reciprocal
and
offsetting
obligations
under
the
bonds
on
the
one
hand
and
the
loan
notes
on
the
other
that
he
didn't
actually
borrow
$4
million
in
the
sense
of
the
marketplace
which
this
court
has
adopted
in
its
--
in
its
decisions
in
construing
23
(b).
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i'm
just
concluding
the
form
now
and
i'll
turn
then
to
the
substance
of
it.
in
the
following
year
of
1954,
the
same
pattern
was
followed.
in
form,
his
prepaid
interest,
aggregating
$143,000
to
the
insurance
company.
the
insurance
company
concurrently
loaned
back
to
him
another
second
augmentation
of
his
loan
of
$104,000
which
meant
that
he
had
then
taken
down
the
total
cash
or
loan
value
of
the
policy
up
to
the
end
of
the
second
year
less
a
thousand
dollars
which
he
left
in.
the
net
result
of
this
pattern
would
be
as
the
tax
clerk
found
if
he
continued
it,
that
at
age
90,
if
he
continued
this
process
of
prepaying
interest
and
borrowing
back
the
full
cash
or
loan
value
each
year
has
augmented
less
a
thousand
dollars.
at
age
90,
he
would
have
received
an
annuity
of
$43
a
month
for
life.
and
for
this,
he
was
investing
amounts
of
close
to
$50,000
a
year
net
to
himself
even
after
taking
into
account
these
loan-backs
to
him
from
the
insurance
company.
now
in
1956,
he
washed
it
out.
he
surrendered
his
policies,
the
insurance
company
cancelled
his
indebtedness
as
augmented
and
he
received
a
thousand
dollars
in
cash
which
was
the
thousand
which
he
was
leaving
in
each
year
in
augmenting
his
cash
and
augmenting
his
indebtedness
against
the
insurance
policies.
now
in
the
first
place,
turning
to
the
substance
of
this
transaction,
we
submit,
that
there
was
no
real
indebtedness
created
here.
the
taxpayer
didn't
actually
borrow
$4
million
from
the
tax
--
from
sam
houston.
now
by
saying
this,
we
don't
mean
to
say
that
money
has
to
change
hands
in
order
for
indebtedness
to
be
created
which
would
serve
as
a
predicate
for
interest
deductions
under
23
(b).
but
certainly,
there
must
be
an
advance
of
dollars
or
there
must
be
an
advance
of
some
tangible
economic
benefits
which
the
taxpayer
receives
forthwith
which
would
be
the
equivalent
of
dollars.
now
in
this
case,
we
think
it
can
be
--
the
difference
between
this
case
and
a
case
where
economic
benefits
which
are
the
equivalent
of
dollars
are
advanced.
i
think
i
can
illustrate
best
for
this
court
by
two
examples.
take
the
case
where
a
property
owner
sells
his
home
and
takes
back
a
purchase
money
mortgage.
now
to
the
extent
of
the
purchase
money
mortgage,
obviously,
no
money
changes
hands.
on
the
other
hand,
the
purchaser
of
the
home
has
actually
received
in
advance
an
immediate
possession
of
tangible
economic
benefits
which
are
the
equivalent
of
dollars.
he
has
the
possession
and
the
use
of
the
home.
and
the
other
example
i
would
advance
is
the
case
where
a
taxpayer
buys
stock
on
margin.
this
example
is
much
highlighted
in
judge
moore's
dissent
in
the
diggs
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
to
which
the
counsel
for
taxpayer
has
referred.
in
such
a
case,
the
taxpayer
receives
the
ownership
of
stock
and
regardless
of
his
indebtedness
to
the
broker.
he
stands
to
profit
by
the
independent
fluctuations
of
value
of
that
stock.
the
value
may
go
up
and
he
may
sell
it
for
a
very
handsome
profit
which
he
is
entitled
to
retain.
by
contrast,
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
insurance
--
this
annuity
contracts
had
no
independent
values,
independent
of
this
circular
loan
transaction.
the
interest
which
the
taxpayer
was
obligated
to
pay
on
his
indebtedness
to
the
company
was
3.5%
per
annum.
the
cash
value
of
the
annuity
contracts
increased
only
2.5%
per
annum.
so
that
the
taxpayer
was
obligated
to
pay
the
insurance
company
1%
more
per
year
of
$4
million
or
the
loan
has
augmented
which
began
as
$4
million,
then
the
insurance
or
the
annuity
contracts
augmented
in
value
each
year.
now
these
--
since
these
annuity
contracts
did
not
have
any
insurance
features,
he
could
not
stand
to
profit
in
any
way
from
--
from
this
transaction
saved
by
tax
benefits.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
no,
your
honor.
because
if
we've
done
what
this
man
did
here,
he
would
have
gotten
$43
a
month
for
life
--
life
by
spending
out-of-pocket
about
$50,000
a
year
which
is
obviously
ridiculous.
you
see,
what
this
man
is
doing
every
year
is
he
is
borrowing
back
against
this
policy,
the
augmentation
of
cash
or
loan
value
--
and
so
his
indebtedness
mounts
astronomically
every
year
and
he
has
to
pay
3.5%
on
that
indebtedness
whereas
the
cash
to
loan
value
is
increasing
only
2.5%
each
year,
he
can't
win.
and
there
--
are
no
insurance
features
here.
the
debt
benefit
for
example,
payable
to
beneficiaries
of
--
if
this
taxpayer
should
die
before
the
maturity
date
was
net
cash
value
which
would
be
the
--
a
thousand
dollars,
the
way
this
fellow
is
working.
because
he
was
borrowing
the
full
cash
or
loan
values
each
year
except
for
a
thousand
dollars.
and
so
also,
all
of
the
other
payments
which
are
contemplated
apart
from
the
annuity
payments
to
him
if
he
lives
to
age
90
and
got
these
payments,
were
all
in
terms
--
are
all
couched
in
terms
of
net
cash
value
which
is
--
he
keeps
(voice
overlap)
a
thousand
dollars.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
right.
but
he
had
to
indulge
in
this
borrowing
back
in
order
to
make
this
transaction
profitable.given
the
fact
that
he
was
paying
3.5%
interest
on
this
very,
very
large
loan
and
millions
of
dollars
and
that
the
--
on
the
other
hand
that
the
policy
was
only
increasing
in
value
by
2.5%
per
year,
he
would
have
a
very
large
out-of-pocket
loss
each
year
on
this
differential
in
interest,
absent
tax
benefits.
now,
how
did
he
deal
with
this
transaction
in
order
to
maximize
his
tax
benefits?
what
he
did
was
to
purport
to
pay
in
1953
and
1954
interest
aggregating
in
each
year
in
excess
of
$140,000.
but
in
each
year,
the
insurance
company
loans
him
back
a
large
portion,
about
two-thirds
of
that
payment,
then
he
claims
as
a
deduction
on
his
return
the
entire
$140,000
per
year.
and
the
tax
benefit
to
him
from
the
deduction
if
it
were
allowed
of
the
entire
140,
would
far
exceed
his
net
out-of-pocket
outlay
after
the
augmentation
is
deducted
from
what
he
dispersed
to
the
company.
and
in
fact,
it
is
set
forth
succinctly
on
page
26
of
our
brief
and
page
27
where
we
--
we
show
just
what
the
figures
would
be.
in
--
for
example,
in
1953
he
purportedly
paid
out
$143,465
in
interest
and
he
claimed
this
as
a
deduction,
the
commissioner
disallowed
it.
the
amount
of
the
deficiency
which
is
not
disputed
to
represent
the
tax
benefit
he
would
have
gotten
would
be
$113,000.
that
was
just
as
good
as
money
in
the
pocket,
$113,000.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
he
can't
win
except
by
tax
benefits.
tax
benefits
were
the
only
thing
he
was
trying
to
purchase.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes
sir.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
no,
your
honor
but
we
say
that
we're
at
the
very
outset,
number
one,
there
is
no
real
advance
of
money
or
equivalent
economic
interest.
there
is
no
indebtedness
within
the
meaning
of
section
23
(b)
and
number
two
where
he
enters
into
a
transaction
which
is
designed
from
the
outset
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
can't
possibly
make
any
profits,
same
in
the
way
of
tax
benefits
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
thing
which
is
within
the
intendment
of
the
statute
that
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
--
congress
did
not
intend
--
excuse
me.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
setup
provisions
in
the
language
of
learned
hand
which
is
quoted
in
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
weller,
that
statutes
are
not
designed
to
allow
benefits
which
by
their
very
terms
turn
out
to
defeat
taxes.
and
that
in
setting
up
a
deduction
for
interest
as
all
other
deductions
that
congress
was
thinking
in
terms
of
transactions
which
had
some
commercial
meaning.
some
purpose
apart
from
simply
purchasing
tax
benefits.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
where
it
is
evident,
the
taxpayer
had
no
hope
of
realizing
any
profit
except
his
tax
benefits.
this
isn't
a
case
of
just
divided
motives
or
divided
possibilities
but
only
a
possibility
of
a
tax
benefit,
certainly
this
is
not
within
the
intendment
of
the
statute.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
and
we
say
he
does
not
get
it,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
he
would
if
his
--
the
deductions
were
allowed,
your
honor
but
we
say
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
--
that
they
should
not
be
allowed.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
he
would
--
he
would
--
the
money
in
the
pocket,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
he
says
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
he
says--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
he
makes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
he
makes
a
curious
argument
that
when
he
entered
this
transaction,
he
was
doomed
to
an
out-of-pocket
loss
whether
or
not
the
interest
deductions
were
allowed
and
therefore
he
had
no
tax
motive.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
we
say
number
one
(voice
overlap).
number
one
that
it
is
incredible
that
a
taxpayer
would
enter
into
a
transaction
which
pretax
or
after
tax,
he
was
doomed
to
a
loss.
and
number
two,
that
if
this
transaction
has
been
carried
on
over
a
long
period
of
years,
he
wouldn't
have
been
far
ahead
of
the
game.
if
you
will
take
just
the
benefits
on
pages
26
and
27
of
our
brief
which
are
key
to
the
record
that
you
would
realize
each
year,
$113,053
just
plain
tax
benefits.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
well,
your
honor,
it
depends.
if
there
are
some
substances
--
if
he
does
what
he
purports
to
do,
we
say
this
is
a
sham
and
the
courts
so
held.
he
didn't
do
what
he
purported
to
do.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
right
and
that's
the
specific.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
and
we
think
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
right.
right,
your
honor.
i
see
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
left
and
i
have
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
excuse
me.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
your
honor
where
they
characterized
a
--
what
purported
to
be
recapitalization
as
devious
and
elaborate
masquerade
as
a
--
the
disguise
for
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
no,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
oh
no,
your
honor,
that's
perfectly
correct.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
that's
correct.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
that's
correct.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
it's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
but
a
taxpayer
must
do
what
he
purports
to
do
in
the
first
instance,
i.e.
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
right.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
right.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
right.
but
we
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
we
say
that
as
merely
cumulative
in
this
case
and
that
is
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
we
--
we
submit
it
so
in
this
case,
your
honor.
having
only
a
moment
or
two
left,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
committee
report
upon
which
the
taxpayer
plays
virtually
his
sole
reliance.
in
that
committee
report,
the
congress
was
enacting
a
prohibition
respectively
only
to
disallow
deductions
of
interest
under
the
various
circumstances
of
this
case
and
of
similar
cases.
in
the
committee
report,
there
are
two
sentences
which
are
critical.
the
first
is,
existing
law
allows
the
deduction
of
interest
paid
on
an
indebtedness
incurred
to
carry
or
continue
an
annuity
contract.
we
say
surely,
congress
had
in
mind
a
genuine
indebtedness
in
saying
that.
it
could
not
have
meant
to
say
that
mere
labels
would
suffice.
it
has
never
said
so
and
it
surely
was
aware
of
this
court's
opinions
in
deputy
versus
du
pont
and
other
decision
to
that
affect.
secondly,
in
going
on
to
sketch
the
transaction,
which
it
did,
doubtless
that
congress
had
in
mind
schemes
of
this
kind
although
it
wasn't
exactly
the
scheme,
but
schemes
along
this
line
doubtless
as
they
were
informed
about
the
sam
houston
insurance
company.
but
what
congress
was
doing
to
or
was
to
say,
we
are
going
to
bar
for
the
future
all
payments
of
this
kind
whether
genuine
or
not,
whether
there's
a
genuine
indebtedness
or
not.
this
area
is
so
thought
with
tax
avoidance
possibilities
that
we
are
not
going
to
allow
transactions
of
this
nature.
now
in
enacting
that
kind
of
a
sweeping
prohibition,
we
submit
that
no
intention
can
be
attributed
to
congress
that
it
turned
around
and
retroactively
legislated
into
23
(b),
a
limitation
or
a
new
extension
of
the
provision
which
will
allow
a
taxpayer
to
claim
a
sham
interest
deduction
simply
by
affixing
that
label
to
a
payment.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes
he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
the
congress
did
not
do
it.
but
i
think
in
that
respect,
the
language
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
haggard
company
is
relevant.
if
we
are
to
draw
inferences,
it
would
seem
as
probable
that
congress
was
content
to
leave
the
problems
of
the
past
to
be
solved
by
the
courts
where
they
were
then
pending
and
there
are
a
lot
of
these
cases
in
the
pipelines
rather
than
to
preclude
their
solution
there
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
answer
here.
we
don't
think
congress
was
saying,
for
the
past
any
payment
labeled
interest,
however
phony,
it's
going
to
be
allowed
as
a
deduction?
they
were
simply
saying,
“existing
law
does
allow
a
deduction
for
interest
on
a
genuine
indebtedness
in
this
area
but
this
area
is
brought
with
tax
avoidance
possibilities.”
therefore,
we're
just
going
to
say
no.
no
deduction
in
this
area
even
if
it's
genuine.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
have
never
--
i
have
never
seen
any
papers
containing
the
written
proposals.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
so
i
understand
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
i
can
--
this
is
--
i
have
personal
knowledge
one
way
or
the
other
but
so
i
understand.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
no
sir,
it's
not
in
the
record.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
well,
the
taxpayer
is
certain.
the
commissioner
asked
for
this
and
i
have
--
had
no
--
been
furnished
with
no
materials
to
rebut
it.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
he
had
on
the
case
of
certain
individuals
who
submitted
ruling
letters
which
incidentally
were
very
fragmentary
and
sketchy
in
the
details
provided.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
we
would
say
he
did
not
seek
to
change
it
but
to
clarify
it.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
to
make
it
clear
for
the
future.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
that
this
are
of
provision
was
enacted,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
because,
we
submit,
that
congress
was
dealing
in
terms
of
genuine
indebtedness
and
genuine
interest
payments
since
it
certainly
did
not
intend
to
allow
retroactively
sham
transactions
to
qualify
under
the
statute.
it's
not
limited
to
sham
transactions.
it
says
loans
on
annuity
contracts
and
certainly
there
can
be
genuine
loans
on
annuity
contracts,
we
don't
dispute
that.
further
argument,
are
such
genuine
loans
prior
to
the
1954
code,
interest
could
be
deducted,
but
it
can't
be
after
1954.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
we
think
they
were
dealing
with
this
scheme
and
with
the
live
schemes
or
all
kinds
of
variations
on
this
scheme,
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
don't
think
they
were
meaning
to
pass
judgment
on
it
to
say
that
this
kind
of
a
scheme
is
--
is
--
represents
genuine
interest
payments
but
they
were
just
simply
saying
that
this
area
is
fraught
with
tax
avoidance
possibilities.
therefore,
for
the
future,
we're
going
to
bar
genuine
interest
payments
and
a
fortiori
certiorari,
sham
interest
payments
simply
to
preclude
any
controversy
in
the
area.
and
of
course
what
the
later
congress
thinks
and
earlier
kinds
of
statement
as
this
court
has
said
in
its
recent
price
decisions,
it's
a
hazardous
speculation.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
your
honor.
you
mean
the
revenue
ruling?
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
it
had
certainly
been
formulated,
your
honor.
it
was
--
actually
published
and
print
about
six
days
after
the
house
of
representatives
report
went
to
the
floor.
but
as
your
honor
well
know
is
these
things
take
the
wheels
grind
slowly
in
the
government
and
these
rulings,
general
rulings
like
these
are
in
process
of
formulating
over
many
months
and
sometimes
years.
mr.
grant
w.
wiprud
oh
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
