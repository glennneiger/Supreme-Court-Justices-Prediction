now
mr.
mclane,
i
understood
counsel
to
--
to
say
that
if
the
petitioner
had
continued
this
arrangement
for
the
30
years
until
he
became
90
years
of
age,
and
had
paid
this
$140,000
a
year
with
the
repayments
back
and
so
forth,
that
when
he
became
90
years
of
age,
he
would
have
an
annuity
that
was
worth
$43
a
month,
is
that
correct?
chief

(voice

about
$40
--
$43
a
month.
chief
justice
earl
warren

thank
you.
