mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
since
the
time
is
limited
to
30
minutes
on
the
summary
calendar,
i
will
not
have
the
opportunity
to
cover
some
of
the
material
that
has
been
submitted
by
other
counsel
in
the
various
amicus
briefs,
and
therefore
i
request
the
court's
knowledge
of
it.
this
case
is
an
income
tax
refund
(inaudible).
the
years
involved
are
1953
and
1954.
the
petitioners,
karl
f.
knetsch
and
eva
knetsch
are
husband
and
wife,
both
of
whom
are
residents
of
california.
with
respect
to
the
transaction
involved,
mr.
knetsch
acted
on
behalf
of
the
community
and
transacted
all
of
the
business
for
himself
and
for
his
wife.
the
sections
of
the
code
involved
are
sections
23
(b)
and
24
(a)
(6)
of
the
1939
code
and
sections
163
(a)
and
section
264
(a)
of
the
1954
code.
section
23
(b)
of
the
1939
code
and
section
163
(a)
of
the
1954
code,
both
authorize
a
deduction
from
gross
income
for
all
interest
paid
or
accrued
on
indebtedness.
section
24
(a)
(6)
of
the
1939
code,
provided
for
the
disallowance
of
certain
items
paid
or
incurred
to
carry
or
purchase
either
a
single-premium
life
insurance
or
endowment
contract.
in
1954,
that
disallowance
provided
for
in
section
24
(a)
(6)
was
broadened
by
section
264
of
the
1954
code.
the
section
provided
in
substance
that
no
deduction
shall
be
allowed
for
any
amount
paid
or
accrued
on
indebtedness
incurred
or
continued
to
purchase
or
carry
a
single-premium,
life
insurance,
endowment
or
annuity
contract.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
mr.
justice
douglas.
it
was
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
it
came
into
effect
in
1954.
the
annuities
involved
in
this
matter
were
purchased
in
1953
but
we
have
two
taxable
years
involved,
1953
and
1954.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
1939
code,
sections
23
(b)
and
section
24
(a)
(6)
were
in
effect
for
the
year
1953.
the
case
arose
in
the
following
fashion.
a
deficiency
notice
was
issued
by
the
commissioner,
a
refund
claim
was
filed
and
the
suit
was
filed
for
a
refund
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
case
was
heard
before
u.s.
district
judge
mathis.
all
of
the
facts
were
stipulated
or
admitted
in
the
answer.
there
were
roughly
70
some
exhibits
which
were
offered
and
most
of
which
were
admitted
in
evidence.
the
question
presented
according
to
the
petitioners'
lights
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
opening
brief
and
i'd
like
to
state,
if
i
may,
what
petitioners'
believe
is
the
question
before
the
court.
it
is
it
seems
to
us
whether
the
courts
below
had
the
power
to
disallow
as
a
deduction
from
gross
income,
interest
paid
on
indebtedness
incurred
to
purchase
and
carry
a
single-premium
annuity
which
was
acquired
before
march
1st,
1954
in
view
of
the
clear
intent
of
congress,
when
in
1954,
it
amended
section
24(a)
(6)
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
and
explained
the
amendment
saying,
“it
has
come
to
your
committee's
attention
that
a
few
insurance
companies
have
promoted
the
plan
for
selling
annuity
contracts
based
on
the
tax
advantage
derived
from
omission
of
annuities
from
the
treatment
accorded
single-premium
life-insurance
or
endowment
contracts.
the
annuity
is
sold
for
a
nominal
cash
payment
with
a
loan
to
cover
the
balance
of
the
single-premium
cost
of
the
annuity.
interest
on
the
loan
(which
may
be
a
nonrecourse
loan)
is
then
taken
as
a
deduction
annually
by
the
purchaser
with
a
resulting
tax
saving
that
reduces
the
real
interest
cost
below
the
increment
and
the
value
produced
by
the
annuity.”
“your
committee's
bill,
will
deny
an
interest
deduction
in
such
cases
but
only
as
to
annuities
purchased
after
march
1st,
1954.
now
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well
except
that
i
--
i
think
i
can
answer
that
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
i
think
it
is
precisely
the
situation
and
i'd
like
to
cover
that
right
now,
if
i
may,
mr.
justice
harlan.
there
is
as
the
court
knows
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
this
question.
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
bond,
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer,
holding
with
legislative
history,
sustained
the
interest
deduction
in
this
case.
the
bond
case
involved
the
same
life
insurance
company
which
is
involved
in
the
case
which
is
now
before
the
court.
the
name
of
the
company
was
the
sam
houston
life
insurance
company.
the
annuity
contracts,
loan
agreements
were
identical.
the
transaction
was
what
is
called
the
sam
houston
transaction.
now,
in
the
1930's,
mr.
justice
harlan,
members
of
the
court,
they've
developed
a
proposal
or
plan
of
selling
single-premium
annuities
to
purchasers
which
never
really
caught
hold,
i
suppose,
because
the
income
tax
rates
among
other
things,
were
not
high
enough
to
make
it
terribly
attractive
to
people.
but
in
effect,
persons
were
buying
single-premium
annuities
and
borrowing
the
amount
of
the
single-premium
from
the
insurance
company
having
the
single-premium
annuity
issued
to
the
purchaser
and
executing
a
note
as
payment
thereof.
this
practice
continued
from
about
1934,
through
the
1930's
and
through
the
1940's,
until
the
early
part
of
1953
when
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
having
observed
advertisements
on
the
wall
street
journal
such
as
one
which
is
involved
in
this
case,
and
having
become
aware
that
there
were
a
fairly
substantial
number
of
these
cases
involved,
i
think
this
petition
for
certiorari
says
here
about
140.
it
went
to
the
congress
in
the
fall
of
1953,
in
the
spring
of
1954
and
asked
the
congress
if
the
congress
would
give
him,
the
commissioner,
remedial
legislations.
the
commissioner
was
not
given
all
that
he
asked.
section
264
and
the
committee
report
explaining
it,
was
published
by
the
ways
and
means
committee
of
the
house
on
about
march
the
9th,
1954.
that
is
the
language
which
i
have
just
read
to
the
court
and
the
language
of
section
264,
states
in
substance,
that
the
bill
or
rather
the
section
only
applies
to
contracts
which
were
acquired
on
or
after
march
1st,
1954.
thereafter,
about
march
17th,
1954,
the
revenue
ruling
which
appears
in
the
back
of
the
government's
brief
in
this
case
was
issued
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
both
the
committee
report
and
the
revenue
ruling
it
seems
to
me,
present
the
transaction
which
is
before
the
court.
now,
i
have
been
under
the
impression
that
because
of
the
advertisements
and
the
advertising
by
the
sam
houston
life
insurance
company
that
this
was
the
transaction
which
the
commissioner
showed
to
the
congress.
if
i
am
wrong,
i
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
from
any
source
that
that
is
not
the
case.
now,
in
1954
after
the
revenue
ruling
was
issued,
a
statutory
notice
of
deficiency
was
then
issued
to
the
taxpayer
in
this
case.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
specifically
and
in
more
detail,
are
set
forth
at
page
5
of
petitioner's
opening
brief.
i'd
like
to
say
before
going
into
these
facts
that
the
record
here
will
show
that
mr.
knetsch
is
a
man
of
considerable
means.
that
is
he
operated
the
business
which
produced
for
him
based
on
the
exhibits
in
this
case,
some
$220
some
thousand
dollars
of
income
from
1955,
$179
for
the
year
1956.
he
--
his
return
showed
approximately
$18,000
of
rental
income
for
both
of
those
years
and
about
$18,000
of
interest
income
in
a
savings
deposit.
those
items
indicate
considerable
means
and
net
worth.
the
particular
transaction
before
the
court
was
one
which
took
place
in
houston,
texas
between
the
petitioner
and
the
sam
houston
life
insurance
company.
on
december
11th,
1953,
mr.
knetsch
acquired
10
single-premium
annuities
from
the
sam
houston
life
insurance
company.
the
purchase
price
set
forth
in
each
annuity
was
$400,400.
the
total
purchase
price
was
paid
by
knetsch's
delivery
to
sam
houston
of
his
check,
his
personal
check
of
$4,000
and
by
the
execution
of
10
separate
contract
loan
agreements
for
$400,000
each.
as
evidence
of
the
$400,000
debt
for
each
annuity,
knetsch
executed
and
delivered
to
sam
houston
the
10
individual
contract
loan
agreements.
each
of
the
10
contract
loan
agreements
provided
that
interest
at
a
rate
specified
in
the
respective
annuity
contracts
of
3.5%
per
annum,
must
be
paid
in
advance.
therefore,
on
december
11th,
1953,
mr.
knetsch
delivered
to
sam
houston
a
cashier's
check
for
$140,000
which
amount
is
3.5%
of
$4
million.
this
sum,
by
the
way,
the
cashier's
check
was
drawn
on
a
los
angeles
california
bank.
this
sum
of
$140,000
constitutes
the
bulk
of
the
$143,465
which
knetsch
claimed
as
an
interest
deduction
for
the
year
1953.
the
additional
$3,465
was
paid
to
sam
houston
by
knetsch
on
or
about
december
16th,
1953
as
a
result
of
this
following
transaction.
on
december
16th,
1953,
mr.
knetsch
borrowed
or
received
an
additional
sum
of
$99,000
from
sam
houston
and
agreed
to
pay
interest
there
on
at
the
rate
of
3.5%
per
annum.
thus,
on
that
same
day,
december
16th,
he
delivered
to
sam
houston
a
second
check
for
$3,465.
concurrently,
with
the
payment
of
this
$3,465
to
sam
houston,
mr.
knetsch
delivered
to
sam
houston
10
contract
loan
agreements,
each
in
the
principal
amount
of
$9,900.
it
is
this
$3,465
payment
of
december
16th,
1953,
plus
the
$140,000
payment
of
december
11th,
1953,
which
comprised
the
total
interest
deducted
and
claimed
by
the
taxpayer
as
being
paid
to
sam
houston
in
1953.
in
short,
petitioners
purchased
each
of
the
10
single-premium
annuities
for
a
nominal
cash
payment,
$400
each
with
a
loan
to
cover
the
balance
of
the
cost
of
each
annuity.
during
the
following
year,
the
$400,000
purchase
price
loan
was
renewed,
an
additional
amount
of
$104,000
was
borrowed
from
sam
houston,
and
again,
a
cashier's
check
was
delivered
in
the
sum
of
$143,465
and
an
additional
check
of
mr.
knetsch's
$3,640
delivery.
the
two
figures
represent
the
claimed
interest
deduction
for
1954.
now
for
the
year
1955,
although
the
year
is
not
before
the
court,
the
same
transaction
occurred
again.
and
in
the
year
1956,
mr.
knetsch
surrendered
his
annuities
to
sam
houston.
at
the
time
of
the
surrender,
he
received
the
cancellation
of
approximately
$307,000
in
indebtedness
plus
$1,000
in
cash.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
interest
deductions
which
he
claimed
for
1953
and
1954
are
proper
deductions
under
section
23
(b)
and
section
163
(a).
in
the
lower
court,
u.s.
district
judge
mathis
held
that
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
wisdom
in
the
united
states
versus
bond
was
the
proper
decision
and
he
therefore
adopted
it.
when
the
case
went
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
at
the
day
of
oral
argument
was
presented
with
the
decision
of
the
third
circuit
in
weller
versus
commissioner
and
in
its
opinion
subsequently
adopted
the
weller
opinion.subsequent
to
the
weller
opinion,
another
circuit,
the
second,
has
decided
the
issue
in
fact
--
in
a
case
in
which
facts
are
quite
similar
to
this
one
and
a
majority
of
the
court
sustained
the
government
approving
the
weller
and
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
wisdom.
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
of
circuit
judge
moore
in
the
diggs
case,
however,
that
is
the
second
circuit's
decision.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
believed
that
not
only
the
committee
language
and
the
section
264
(a)
of
the
1954
code,
reflect
that
this
transaction
was
presented
to
the
congress
and
that
the
congress
adopted
of
course
with
respect
to
it
but
if
the
legislation
and
the
legislative
history
for
the
intersection
and
the
interest
of
disallowance
sections
all
the
way
back
to
1932
reflect
the
intent
of
congress
that
items
such
as
these
and
the
instant
case
would
be
proper
deductions.
in
the
dissent
of
judge
wisdom
and
weller
opinion,
the
petitioner
submit
that
judge
wisdom
has
not
given
effect
to
the
section
passed
in
1954
nor
to
the
committee
language
explaining
that
section.
judge
wisdom
said
that,
while
it
is
true
that
section
264
provides
for
disallowance
under
certain
circumstances
that
it
does
not
follow.
if
the
taxpayer
shows
that
section
264
does
not
apply
that
he
perforce
to
use
the
language
of
the
government's
brief
is
allowed
a
deduction
under
section
23
(b)
and
of
course,
the
petitioners
and
the
taxpayers
did
not
suggest
that
that
is
their
position.
clearly,
we
are
not
entitled
to
an
interest
deduction
simply
if
we
show
that
section
264
does
not
disallow
the
interest
deduction.
what
we
are
intending
is
that
the
language
of
this
committee
report
reflects
an
intent
by
congress
in
1954
to
treat
this
type
of
transaction
in
a
certain
manner
that
while
that
committee
language
explains
--
is
found
rather
under
the
explanation
to
section
264
that
it
certainly
reflects
the
position
of
congress
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
interest
in
this
cases
was
or
was
not
to
be
disallowed.
the
internal
revenue
code,
petitioner
submit
as
an
integrated
whole,
it
does
not
consist
of
the
series
of
isolated
sections,
each
living
in
a
world
of
its
own
and
that
when
the
congress
decided
to
disallow
interest
in
such
cases
as
the
committee
language
states,
there
really
was
no
other
section
where
it
would
disallow
what
it
considered
to
be
an
interest
deduction
other
than
in
section
264.
in
wisdom's
--
in
judge
wisdom's
dissent
in
the
weller
opinion,
it
was
also
indicated,
and
i
believe
it's
the
government's
position
here
that
interest
could
not
have
exist
in
that
case
because
interest
is
limited
to
indebtedness
incurred
for
the
payment
of
the
sum
of
money
which
is
actually
received.
petitioner
submit
that
the
court
has
held
that
interest
is
paid
for
indebtedness
assumed
or
acquired
for
the
use
or
forbearance
of
money
and
that
in
this
case,
there
certainly
was
forbearance
of
the
sum
which
is
represented
by
the
face
amounts
of
the
notes
which
were
executed
by
mr.
knetsch.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
since
the
petitioners
only
have
about
10
or
11
minutes
left
of
their
time,
i
would
prefer
if
i
may,
to
save
that
time
for
rebuttal.
in
closing
the
opening
statement,
the
petitioners
do
ask
the
court
to
note
appendix
d
of
the
reply
brief
wherein
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
moore
in
diggs
versus
commissioner
is
found.
that
short
opinion
states
the
petitioners'
view
in
succinct
and
cogent
fashion.
along
with
the
majority
opinion
in
united
states
versus
bond,
judge
moore
sets
forth,
we
think,
the
proper
view
in
this
matter.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
i've
been
representing
taxpayer
in
this
case
from
the
district
court.
this
is
the
first
time
the
word
“sham”
is
been
used.
i
think
that
if
you'll
read
the
briefs
in
this
case
in
the
court
and
find
that
there
is
no
use
of
that
term
up
to
this
point,
the
government's
position
has
been,
that
there
is
no
indebtedness
here
because
there
were
no
economic
benefits
and
the
government
says
there
is
no
economic
benefits
because
without
tax
benefit
they
argue,
the
transaction
could
not
have
resulted
into
profit
to
the
taxpayer.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
court
below
and
the
argument
was
that
this
was
a
masquerade
of
sham
that
under
gregory
versus
helvering
clearly
that
disposes
off
the
matter.
however,
the
argument
that
the
petitioners
made
from
the
lower
court
on
is
that
gregory
versus
helvering
came
into
existence
to
assist
or
alleviate
the
case
where
a
taxpayer
had
formally
complied
with
the
literal
provisions
of
the
statute.
it
seemed
to
me
that
judge
learned
hand
said
that
where
there
is
this
formal
or
literal
compliance,
it
will
not
be
given
effect
for
tax
purposes
if
to
do
so
would
be
to
defeat
the
intent
of
congress.
but
then,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
within
our
back,
it's
the
petitioner's
primary
argument
in
this
case
which
was
that
these
transactions
were
commonly
known
from
1934
through
1954.
these
transactions,
in
fact,
this
one
was
presented
to
the
congress.
the
congress
was
aware
of
it
from
1934
on
and
not
in
1954
as
the
government
mentioned
in
its
brief.
here,
the
united
states
has
left
the
impression
and
i'd
like
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
if
i
could,
that
somehow
or
another,
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
has
created
a
large
interest
deduction
out
of
the
thin
air
so
to
speak
at
no
cost
of
him.
the
fact
here
is
that
he
reaches
this
conclusion
only
by
emphasizing
that
there
were
tax
benefits
if
he
had
continued
on
with
the
program.
the
government
ignores
the
fact
that
this
taxpayer
surrendered
his
contract
in
1956.
as
a
result
of
that
surrender,
he
must
pay
in
the
year
1956
ordinary
income
tax
on
a
rough
--
approximately
$308,000
of
additional
income
which
represents
the
indebtedness
which
was
cancelled
when
these
contracts
were
surrendered.
the
additional
tax
on
that
has
been
computed
in
our
brief
and
it
was
computed
in
the
lower
court
and
there
has
been
no
dispute
raised
yet
as
to
the
correctness
of
those
computations
that
this
additional
tax
which
he
must
pay
now
for
the
year
1956
will
be
$269,869.21.
in
addition,
mr.
knetsch
paid
insurance
company,
sam
houston,
$137,315
and
more
than
he
received
from
it.
this
makes
a
total
of
$401,184.21
and
i
say
that
that
sum,
mathematically
speaking,
is
$50,650.36
more
than
the
$356,533.85
tax
benefits
which
the
u.s.
says
he
realized
for
the
years
1953,
1954,
and
1955.
so
all
i'm
arguing
here
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
government
argues,
there's
been
tax
avoidance
and
that
purely
because
there
was
tax
avoidance,
the
transaction
should
be
ignored
that
the
facts
of
the
case
should
show
that
the
taxpayer
realize
tax
avoidance.
in
this
case,
i
think
or
rather
realized
tax
benefits.
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear,
he
did
not.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
well
of
course
if
the
interest
deductions
are
sustained,
that
is
if
this
was
indebtedness
and
if
the
interest
disallowed
for
1953,
1954
and
1955,
yes
there
was
debt.
he
owed
the
company
the
difference
between
--
he
owed
the
company
--
if
you'll
turn
to
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
--
my
brief
mr.
justice
whittaker
at
page
--
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
on
page
6,
you
will
note
that
the
proceeds
of
the
loans,
$307,000,
are
listed
as
a
receipt
from
the
company.
in
addition,
he
received
from
the
company
$1,000
making
a
total
of
$308,000.
that
sum
represents
the
$4
million
which
he
originally
paid
plus
the
$307,000
which
he
borrowed
in
each
of
the
succeeding
three
years
making
a
total
of
$307,000
plus
the
one
he
received
from
the
company
upon
surrender.
therefore
at
surrendering,
he
realized
a
total
amount
of
$4,308,000.
he
had
a
cost
basis
of
$4
million,
therefore
he
had
$307,000
and
$308,000
of
gain
upon
which
he
must
pay
ordinary
income
tax
because
upon
surrender,
there
cannot
conceivably
be
capital
gain
treatment
even
though
there
was
at
that
time
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
be
applied.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
not
until
he
surrendered
or
until
he
dispose
off
the
contract,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
concluding,
i'd
like
to
say
that
in
this
case,
since
congress
was
aware
since
1934
of
this
method
of
purchasing
single
premium
annuities,
since
the
taxpayer
has
relied
upon
the
law
which
existed
since
1934
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
statute
which
existed
prior
to
1954
and
also
as
it
reads
subsequent
to
1954.
to
argue
that
the
1954
committee
language
sheds
no
light
on
the
problem
for
earlier
years,
ignores,
it
seems
to
me
the
long
congressional
history
regarding
the
borrowing
of
sums
to
purchase
single
premium
annuities
or
1934
on.
furthermore,
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
didn't
somewhat
more
than
counsel
has
suggested.
i
think
that
it
affirmatively
acted
with
respect
to
1953
by
saying
as
mr.
justice
whittaker
quoted
the
language
that
interest
in
such
cases
will
be
disallowed
if
the
contract
is
acquired
on
or
after
march
1st,
1954.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes
sir,
if
you
assume
that
each
year
he
borrowed
the
full
cash
surrendered
value
of
the
annuity,
then
the
amount
that
he
would've
received
at
the
age
of
90
would've
been
the
cash
surrendered
value
compounded
at
2.5%
annually,
that
is
a
correct
statement.
mr.
w.
lee
mclane,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
stipulated
over
to
court.
