mr.
james
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
proceeding
my
argument
further,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
i
was
suggested
during
the
recess
that
i
may
not
have
made
my
answer
clear
or
may
have
not
answered
it
correctly
or
may
have
been
misunderstood.
in
regard
to
the
direct
sales,
i
meant
my
answer
to
mean
that
there
was
a
power
to
regulate
the
transportation,
but
not
the
rates
for
such
direct
sales.
i
don't
know
whether
my
answer
meant
that
to
you
or
not,
but
that
is
the
correct
answer
and
that's
what
i
intended
by
my
answer.
now
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
think
that
the
hope
natural
gas
case
was
of
any
help
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
although
they
referred
to
it,
we
think
that
it
followed
--
it
did
not
decide
this
particular
question,
you
recall
in
that
opinion,
the
court
did
say
that
while
conservation
was
not
a
factor
in
determining
just
and
reasonable
rates,
and
there
were
two
strenuous
dissents
in
which
mr.
justice
jackson
went
at
some
length,
talking
about
the
importance
of
conservation
in
preserving
this
important
fuel
for
superior
uses.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
also
brought
the
dissent
and
joined
in
mr.
justice
jackson's
dissent
there.
but
in
addition,
the
court
in
the
opinion
went
into
the
fact
that
in
a
transportation
case
and
certification,
that
under
section
7,
it
was
proper
to
consider
conservation
considerations
and
the
power
commission
had
that
power
and
referred
in
a
footnote
to
statements
by
the
power
commission
in
that
regard.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that
is
correct.
and
it
has
no
power
as
such
to
regulate
the
rates.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
which
he
buys,
where
there's
this
kind
of
a
transaction.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
but
the
position
of
the
commission
is
that
in
determining
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
whether
to
grant
a
certificate
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that's
right.
they
have
the
right
to
consider
the
use
that
is
to
be
made
of
the
gas
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
in
the
interest
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
concede
that
point,
mr.
justice
stewart,
because
the
act
says
transportation
interstate;
it
doesn't
say
by
pipeline.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
so
it's
still
a
question.
now
the
examiner
did
use
that
example
as
though
it
would
be
conceded
that
there
was
no
right
to
regulate,
but
the
act
is
specific
in
its
terms
in
saying
transportation
interstate
and
we
certainly
would
insist
that
while
it
hasn't
been
ruled
on
by
the
parties.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
there
--
i
think
there
are
some
possibilities
of
liquid
gas
and
in
relatively
small
amounts
and
it,
as
we
say
in
the
footnote
to
our
brief,
is
a
developing
industry,
and
so
--
but
we
do
not
concede,
and
we
make
it
expressed
in
the
brief
that
we
do
not
concede
that
position.
now
the
east
ohio
case
was
completely
disregarded
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
didn't
even
refer
to
it.
and
you
recall
there
the
--
there
was
a
basic
issue
in
regard
to
whether
or
not,
there
had
to
be
a
coupling
of
the
regulation
of
rates
with
transportation,
in
order
to
be
able
to
control
or
have
the
power
to
control
the
transportation
and
the
court
held
two
things.
one,
was
the
right
to
regulate
the
rates
within
the
state
and
also
the
power
to
certificate,
power
in
the
commission,
to
certificate
the
transportation
independently.
and
in
the
hinshaw
amendment
when
the
congress
choused
the
holding
of
the
court
in
regard
to
the
right
to
regulate
the
rates
intrastate
in
such
a
transaction,
it
did
not
change
at
all,
the
power
of
the
commission
to,
as
it
was
recognized
by
this
court,
to
control
the
transportation
featured
by
the
certification
under
section
7.
now,
it's
claimed
that
despite
all
of
this,
it
is
unreasonable;
it's
arbitrary
because
there
isn't
any
showing
that
anybody
else
is
going
to
do
what
the
consolidated
edison
is
trying
to
do
here.
in
the
first
place,
they
assumed
that
that
price
is
so
high
$19.25
and
the
transco
prices
were
substantially
less
at
the
time
that
nobody
else
will
be
attracted
to
it.
now,
in
taking
--
you
have
to
take
into
account
in
that
regard,
that
transco
has
raised
its
price
twice
so
that
now,
with
the
compromised
rate,
and
they
haven't
got
a
final
rate
on
the
last
application,
the
rate
is
$37.06
as
i
recall
against
a
little
over
$42,
it's
about
in
half.
i
think
it
is
$42.50
for
this,
with
the
transportation
charge
and
the
cost
of
the
product
together.
so
that
there's
about
five
cents
differential
as
distinguished
from
what
it
was
more
than
10
or
12
cents
before.
so
that
the
closer
it
gets
to
that
$42.50
rate,
the
more
attractive
this
is
going
to
be.
but
beyond
that,
at
the
very
time,
they
had
an
application
for
boiler
fuel
in
a
substantial
amount
before
the
commission,
for
vepco.
they
had
testimony
of
long
island
lighting
that
they
had
been
trying
to
make
direct
purchases,
so
that
they
could
be
able
to
have
a
comparable
transaction
to
this.
they
had
testimony
that
transco
had
told
its
other
large
consumers
that
they
had
better
try
to
see
what
they
could
do
by
buying
directly
and
handling
the
same
kind
of
x-20
transactions.
they
had
the
testimony
that
public
service
of
new
jersey
had
been
informed
that
if
they'd
--
if
this
was
approved,
they
better
get
busy
and
buy
directly
too.
they
had
the
due
power
application
in
regard
to
use
of
large
quantities
of
boiler
fuel
for
that
power
operation.
they
had
the
--
they
have
the
present
applications
of
el
paso
natural
gas
to
use
for
their
compressors,
large
quantities
of
boiler
fuel
by
direct
purchase
and
a
claim
that
they're
exempt
from
regulations
just
like
the
x-20.
and
now,
the
southern
california
edison
has
come
out
for
some
335,000
mcf.
per
day
that
they
want
to
take
around
through
mexico
and
up
the
coast
in
order
to
avoid
the
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission
at
all.
now,
this
is
a
crucial
issue
to
the
federal
power
commission
of
its
power
to
determine
in
the
interest
of
this
country,
whether
or
not,
this
gas
shall
be
used
in
such
a
manner
that
it
is
not
in
the
public
interest
and
convenience
and
necessity
or
is,
and
the
statute
says
that,
"unless,
it
is
required
by
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity
of
the
country,
that
it
shall
be
denied,
is
that
specific.
and
this
power
should
be
recognized
in
the
commission
in
accordance
with
its
holding."
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
and
i've
divided
part
of
it
with
my
co-counsel.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
deal
briefly
with
the
inquiry
of
mr.
justice
douglas
about
the
houston
case,
which
is
also
called
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
douglas.
but
there
has
to
be
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
well
the
policy
is
there
must
be
some
special
reason
to
justify
because
it
is
an
inferior
use.
now
in
the
houston
case,
which
is
called
the
florida
case
because
it
was
to
get
gas
to
florida
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
no.
that
was
a
direct
purchase
in
the
florida
situation,
in
the
houston
case.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that's
exactly
the
same.
and
the
reason
that
they
permit
it
with
the
dissent
by
commissioners
connole
and
klein
at
that
time
was
that
was
the
only
--
the
showing
was
it
was
the
only
way
that
they
could
make
the
pipeline
to
florida
so
that
natural
gas
would
be
available
to
people
in
florida,
economic.
the
proof
was
that
was
the
only
way
they
could
get
it
there,
and
it
was,
for
that
reason
and
that
reason
alone,
that
the
commission
proved
it.
now
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that
is
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
well
it's
a
combination.
it's
clearly
recognized
that
this
is
an
inferior
use
as
far
as
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that
the
superior
use
is
a
use
by
consumers
for
house
heating,
domestic
use
of
heating
water
and
cooking.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that
is
part
of
it,
because
the
federal
trade
commission,
in
its
report,
which
was
this
court
has
referred
to
as
the
reason
for
the
natural
gas
act,
in
which
is
recited
in
preamble
or
the
first
part
of
the
act,
as
being
the
reason,
as
said
in
so
many
words
that
boiler
use
was
an
inferior
use.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that's
right
and
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
i
think
that
the
commission
would
take
that
into
consideration
under
public
convenience
and
necessity
properly,
and
it
would
be
one
of
the
factors
waived
with
all
the
rest
of
them
here
to
determine.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
they
found
it
and
didn't
justify
it.
so
that
--
but
they
didn't
weigh
it.
they
took
it
into
account
and
found
that
it
would
not
support
the
award
of
the
certificate.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that's
right.
i
recognize
that.
but
on
the
other
hand,
conservation
is
a
consideration
that
this
court
has
recognized
and
the
commission
has
and
it's
tried
to
weigh
these
things.
now,
what
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
that
they
claimed,
they
would
have
a
right
to
buy
this
gas
in
texas
and
flare
it,
just
let
it
go
out
in
the
air
and
burn
it
or
just
let
it
go
in
new
york.
and
the
commission
has
no
power,
except
to
say
whether
they'll
permit
it
to
be
transported
regardless
of
that
use.
and
the
basic
issue
of
the
government
--
the
federal
power
commission
is
that
pubic
convenience
and
necessity
is
such
that
and
has
always
been
conceded
to
include
the
various
considerations
that
would
make
up
that
and
they
can
deny
the
transportation
even
though
the
purchase
is
valid
and
the
use
would
be
valid
but
they
don't
have
to
permit
transportation
that
is
not
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
that
kind
of
use.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
the
fact
that
--
no,
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
the
purchase
on
the
whole
industry
was
such
that
it
would
damage
the
interest
of
the
consumer
was
what
was
the
denial
of
the
case.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that's
right.
but
they
don't
all
have
this
damaging
effect.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
i
think
it
was
be
the
effect
in
this
particular
case
plus
the
fact
that
this
is
demonstrated
by
the
record
to
be
something
that
transco
has
held
out.
they
said
to
every
purchaser
they
had,
but
they
finally
changed
what
we
couldn't
hold
it
out
to
little
purchasers,
they
couldn't
do
it.
but
they
held
it
out
to
everyone
in
their
big
purchasers
if
you
--
if
con
edison
gets
it,
then
the
rest
of
you
get
the
same
thing.
and
that
would
destroy
the
whole
gas
industry
that
was
to
protect
the
little
consumers
throughout
this
country.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
well
but
they
used,
as
i
pointed
out,
case
after
case
here,
where
they're
trying
to
use
it
in
regard
to
their
burrs,
they're
using
it
--
they
want
to
use
it
in
regard
to
their
compressors.
they
want
to
take
it
all
the
way
around
to
california
through
mexico,
to
have
it
not
regulated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
millions
and
millions
of
thousand
cubic
feet
of
gas,
they're
all
shown
here
that
these
various
considerations
so
that
i
don't
see
how
the
federal
power
commission
could
disregard
these
other
potential
cases
right
before
their
eyes.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
claim
to
have
any
such
power.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
i
think
so,
because
i
think
that
they
have
to
apply
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
and
if
they
don't
find
that
affirmatively
required,
they
do
not
grant
it,
and
here,
the
fact
that
this
would
be
damaging
to
the
whole
industry
and
the
protection
of
the
consumer
and
also
this
business
of
conservation
is
not
any
mere
bug
of
the
lure
or
something
that's
threatened.
when
you
think
of
how
the
gas
passed
the
reserves
that
this
country
have
gone
down,
as
far
as
the
estimate
is
concerned,
so
that
they're
talking
now
in
terms
of
20
some
years
in
exhaustion,
rather
than
30
some
years.
it's
a
real
consideration,
and
the
commission
says
that
it
has
the
power
to
consider
all
of
those
elements.
now,
this
wasn't
a
new
proposition.
there
were
20
years
of
regulation
under
the
term,
public
convenience
and
necessity,
prior
to
the
natural
gas
act
and
under
the
icc
and,
of
course,
this
court's
recognized
that
that
was
the
source
of
that
term.
and
when
you
took
public
convenience
and
necessity
in
case
after
case,
in
regard
to
the
icc,
you
didn't
say,
why
if
there
can
be
--
if
you
can
find
the
consideration
that
weather
or
not,
this
line
has
got
the
money
and
has
got
the
route
and
whether
or
not,
there's
somewhat
else
competing
with
it,
that
those
are
the
only
things
you
can
look
at
about
public
convenience
and
necessity.
this
court
has
said
you
can
look
at
the
whole
thing,
the
whole
fabric,
to
see
what
it
does
for
the
people
of
this
country
in
the
area
that's
applied
for.
and
in
that,
you
take
all
of
these
considerations
to
protect
the
top,
the
real
purpose
of
the
act
which
is
to
protect
consumers.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
of
course,
i
don't
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
i
don't
concede
that's
the
case
here.
i
say
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
well,
nobody's
complaining
about
it.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
they
can
buy
as
much
as
they
wanted.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
no,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
this
is
different,
because
i
think
this
particular
facility,
when
you
certificate
a
carrier,
you're
talking
about
a
capacity
of
the
pipeline,
and
pipelines
don't
have
indefinite
or
unlimited
capacity.
they
are
dependent
upon
their
capital
power,
their
power
to
borrow
the
money,
and
the
extent
of
their
ability
to
build
such
pipelines.
and
they
can
only
build
so
much
with
any
capital
structure.
so
that
you're
talking
about,
shall
this
portion
of
the
pipeline
be
used,
preempted,
dedicated
anywhere
you
want
to
use
for
it,
for
the
purpose
of
this
kind.
is
it
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
interest?
and
i
think
that's
where
--
that's
the
test.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
and
i
concede
that
the
purchase
is
allowed
and
they
can
purchase
and
nobody
is
saying
they
can't.
but
i
say
there
is
no
place
that
congress
said
that
if
it
isn't
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
they
have
a
right
to
transport.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
well
they
can
make
it
effective
for
many
things
but
they
can't
make
effective,
as
far
as
being
transported,
because
congress
said
that
has
to
be
subject
to
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes,
in
regard
to
the
end
use,
it
has
in
the
number
of
cases.
there
are
some
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes.
they
have
in
this
way,
they
have
said
where
they
applied
for
gas
for
boiler
use,
you
can
have
that
gas
for
boiler
use,
you
can
have
it
for
starting
the
boiler
or
for
the
preliminary
heating
up.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
they
took
the
position
that
they
had
a
right
to
control
the
conservation
aspects
of
end
use.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
well,
they
were
trying
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
i'm
advised
that
it
has
and
as
far
as
we've
set
out
in
the
brief
in
detail,
the
cases
and
i
think
they
show
that
they
have
tried
to
exercise
it
in
that
manner.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
well
i
can
answer
that
mr.
justice
clark
in
this
way
that
boiler
fuel
user
contracts
have
been
set
out.
we
don't
--
i
don't
know
of
any
just
like
x-20.
this
is
a
peculiar
animal,
not
the
way
it's
come
up.
but
the
comparable
boiler
use
cases
have
been
set
out.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
yes
--
no,
the
only
direct
purchase
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
james
lee
rankin
--
would
be
the
florida
case.
the
others
are
i
think,
more
of
the
other
kind.
mr.
james
lee
rankin
but
there
maybe
some
direct
purchases
too.
they're
all
--
we
tried
to
deal
with
all.
