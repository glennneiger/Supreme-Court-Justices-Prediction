mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
be
very
happy
if
i
could
meet
the
distinguished,
solicitor
general
to
debate
much
of
what
he
has
said
in
the
proper
forum
which
would
be
the
holds
of
congress.
in
our
view,
he
has
not
answered
the
controlling
issue,
the
issue
which
is
disposed
in
this
case
at
all,
and
that
if
that
portion
of
his
argument,
which
relates
to
end
use
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission
in
deciding
a
case
on
evidence,
a
no
evidence
report
that
on
policy
considerations
outside
the
record,
100%.
i
--
those
matters
are
not
reached
at
all
until
the
primary
question
is
met.
did
the
congress
rest
in
the
commission
the
power
to
regulate
in
this
subject
matter
that
it
did
here?
that
was
the
question
that
was
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that's
the
question
we've
raised.
we've
stressed
it
in
our
brief.
we've
pointed
out
the
decisions
of
this
court,
hope,
panhandle,
indiana
and
so
forth
on
which
this
court
has
passed
on
that
question
in
a
number
of
different
forums,
he
has
not
replied
in
his
brief
or
in
his
argument.
now,
let's
get
right
down
to
the
facts.
con
edison
had
a
serious
air
pollution
problem
in
new
york
city,
in
the
vicinity
of
the
united
nations
at
its
waterside
plant
which
was
an
old
plant,
built
57
years
ago,
when
it
was
an
area
of
slums
and
slaughter
houses.
now,
it
is
the
most
congested
area
of
the
world
with
great
tall
buildings,
as
well
as
the
united
nations.
i've
read
this
morning's
papers,
as
to
this
being
a
makeweight
argument
where
the
commissioner
of
pollution,
because
of
an
inverted
condition
such
as
we're
familiar
with
in
los
angeles,
having
occurred
in
new
york,
is
asking
industry
to
cut
back
on
every
possible
use.
asking
people
not
to
use
cars,
not
to
burn
leaves.
this
was
no
makeweight
argument
but
as
was
suggested
by
mr.
justice
harlan,
that
question
is
not
reached
with
the
commission
lacked
the
power
to
make
the
decision
it
did.
our
basic
objection
with
the
commission's
decision
is
that
if
denied
the
transportation
certificate
to
transco
for
no
reason
whatsoever,
related
to
the
transportation
function,
but
for
the
sole
reason,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
when
he
gave
you
the
four
purposes,
for
this
primary
purpose,
that
it
disapproved
of
the
public
policy
and
wisdom
of
con
edison's
going
to
texas,
making
a
direct
non-jurisdictional
purchase
of
this
gas
and,
may
i
say,
that
when
con
edison
made
that
direct
purchase
in
texas,
there
was
no
power
of
the
commission
over
that.
if
he
could've
used
the
gas
in
texas,
as
approximately
half
of
all
the
natural
gas
produced
in
this
country
is
used
in
the
state
production,
there
would
be
no
federal
power
commission
question.
if
con
edison
had
built
his
own
pipeline
from
texas
to
new
york,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
commission,
that
commission
would
have
no
jurisdiction.
the
montana
power
company
built
a
line
into
wyoming
and
made
a
direct
purchase
of
gas
for
boiler
fuel
in
transport
and
it
submitted
the
matter
nine
years
ago.
think
of
the
nine
years
in
this
argument
that
a
great
flood
is
going
to
be
unloosed
by
this
and
the
commission
held
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
now
what
happened
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
into
wyoming,
crossing
state
lines
for
its
own
use
and
consumption,
not,
of
course,
for
resale,
electric
company
alone.
and
it
submitted
to
the
commission
and
said,
"do
we
have
--
do
you
have
jurisdiction
over
this
transaction?
if
so
grant
this
certificate,
we
think
not,
if
so
deny
it
on
the
ground
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.”
and
the
commission
denied
it
on
that
ground.
now,
here,
a
purchaser,
a
direct
purchaser
from
the
producer,
may
use
his
gas
as
he
sees
fit.
so
that
edison
was
in
the
position,
it
had
made
a
non-jurisdictional
purchase,
it
could
use
the
gas,
and
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
in
his
answer
that
if
the
gas
were
bottled
and
transported
by
a
truck
or
a
ship,
that
it
would
be
the
subject
of
regulation.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
well-known
fact
that
a
large
part
of
the
household
supply
of
gas
in
the
united
states
is
bottled
gas
that
we
have
outside,
and
which
has
been
clearly
understood,
not
within
the
scope
of
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
after
that
was
--
edison
was
in
the
position
that
it
bought
its
gas,
it
could
use
it,
whether
the
air
pollution
of
the
united
nations
is
good
or
bad.
it
could
use
it
as
it
saw
it
fit.
it
then
went
to
transco
and
it
said,
"will
you
build,
for
our
account,
additional
facilities
and
will
you
operate
those
facilities
to
bring
our
gas
from
texas
to
new
york
city
for
our
use?"
and
let
me
say
that
the
examiner,
the
commission
itself,
found
that
there
was
no
disadvantageous
effect
in
that
transportation
service.
it
was
found
that
all
of
the
standards
prescribed
in
section
7
of
the
act
had
been
matched.
it
found
that
the
standards,
which
since
1938,
it
had
it
evolved
and
applied
in
case
after
case
for
a
transportation
certificate,
had
been
met.
that's
what
was
called,
the
conventional
ones.
it
found
that
the
charge
which
transco
made
was
compensatory
to
it.
it
found
there
was
no
burden
on
any
of
the
services
rendered
by
transco
in
making
that
transportation.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
none,
whatsoever.
con
edison's
interest
in
transco
is
to
get
as
much
gas
as
it
needs
at
the
time
when
it
needs
it
for,
including
the
peak
periods
and
at
the
lowest
possible
price.
and
it
--
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
quite
contrary
to
what
solicitor
general
had
suggested
that
this
price
was
out
of
line,
was
out
of
line
by
a
decision
that
commission
made
years
after
of
this
matter
had
come
up,
not
and
at
that
time.
and
actually
in
the
case
where
that
was
up,
the
commission
itself
referred
to
this
charge
by
texas
producers
for
the
direct
sales
to
edison.
i
--
the
majority
thought
it
was
a
good
precedent
to
use
because
it
was
honestly,
the
minority
that
had
some
questions.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
no,
it
is
not,
sir.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
it
is
not.
we
don't
reach
that
question
at
all.
the
commission
--
i
think
possibly
the
basic
mistake
that
it
made
was
that
it
thought
it
was
dealing
with
a
producer
rate
case
that
is
a
certificate
for
sale
or
for
resale,
such
as
you
had
in
catco
and
other
situations.
i
think
that
perhaps
led
it
astray.
now,
we
had
no
other
--
edison
had
no
other
place
to
get
this
case,
if
it
was
to
use
it
for
this
purpose
of
air
pollution
at
waterside.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
do
not
think
i
could
go
that
far
and
i
do
not
go
that
far,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
i
say
that
when
the
commission
came
to
consider
the
transportation
of
this
gas,
it
was
entitled
to
consider
the
specific
elements
involved
in
that
section
and
everything
else
that
related
to
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
of
that
transportation
function.
now,
if
--
carrying
through
the
suggestion
that
was
--
you
were
trying
to
clear
up,
this
was
an
affiliated
company.
and
the
pipeline
was
making
two
lower
charge
for
the
transportation
service
so
that
it
was
a
burden
on
the
customers
of
transco
to
take
gas
for
resale,
then
i
think
that
was
properly
considered
--
would
be
--
would've
been
properly
considered
by
the
commission.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
yes.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
not
--
no.
the
--
the
montana
case.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
well,
there
is
no
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
think
it
--
i
think
it
does
make
a
difference.
and
real
question
which
the
solicitor
general
has
failed
to
deal
with
in
his
briefs
or
argument
is
whether
the
undoubted
power
to
certificate
the
transportation
by
transco,
can
be
used
as
a
device
to
regulate
and
prohibit
because
that's
what
it
is,
to
prohibit
the
edison
purchase
which
is
a
matter
not
within
its
jurisdiction.
now,
i
am
being
somewhat
positive
in
my
statement
that
the
commission
and
the
solicitor
general,
i
believe,
agrees
with
it,
that
the
commission
made
no
of
hypocritical
claim
that
it
was
regulating
--
denying
this
certificate
for
any
transportation
reason.
it
found
these
benefits,
these
conventional
standards
had
been
met
and
in
a
recent
case
filed
with
the
dc
circuit
here,
the
commission
referring
to
x-20
decision,
used
these
words
that,
“its
action
was
an
attempt
to
foil
that
transaction
by
denying
the
transportation
certificate.”
and
i
could
refer
you
to
--
rather
strange
perhaps,
but
i
suggest
an
uneasy
conscience
on
the
part
of
the
federal
power
commission
but
it's
been
prolific
in
case
after
case,
which
is
decided
subsequent
with
the
x-20
to
going
back
and
trying
to
explain
what
it
did
decide
in
that
case.
and
one
that
is
very
interesting,
i
now
refer
to
it
by
means
of
pointing
out
something
that
i
don't
think
the
solicitor
general
has
been
informed
about.
he
said
that
these
sales
had
been
authorized
and
they
have
been
last
year.
the
sales
of
natural
gas
in
this
nation
were
about
13
billion
mcf.
of
which
3
billion
went
to
householders.
the
other
10
billion
went
to
industry,
commercial,
well
drilling,
all
kinds
of
uses
of
that
sort.
in
this
midwestern
case,
there
is
a
dispute
among
the
commissioners
as
there
was
here.
the
--
the
vote
here
was
3
for
the
opinion
1
for
the
result,
but
for
not
going
long
with
the
reasons,
in
the
third
trial
dissent.
in
the
midwestern
case,
the
evidence
showed
that
the
pipeline
was
proposing
to
sell
gas
to
industry
below
its
cost.
and
certain
of
the
commissioners,
realizing
that
that
would
make
the
householder,
the
small
user
which
is
supposedly
the
cherished
person,
pay
more
than
he
should
pay.
i
objected.
now,
the
majority
in
referring
to
x-20
decision,
said
that
was
--
their
action
was
one
of
denying
an
application
to
permit
the
sale
of
natural
gas
for
boiler
fuel,
not
a
word
about
transportation.
in
another
one,
the
trunk
line,
the
interesting
question
there
was
whether
the
price
that
edison
had
negotiated
could
be
used
in
the
trunk
line
case
as
a
good
precedent,
because
of
its
arms-like
nature.
the
majority
said,
referring
to
x-20,
"the
sales
failed
by
reason
of
our
denial
of
a
transportation
certificate.
the
dissenting
commissioner,
connole,
a
man
of
great
ability
said,
"the
certificate
was
denied
in
part,
because
the
direct
purchase
of
these
volumes
of
gas
would
tend
to
raise
the
rates
unduly."
now,
i
should
correct
myself,
it
was
mr.
--
commissioner
klein
in
the
midwestern
case
who
was
objecting
to
the
sale
of
the
industry
below
cost
and
the
effect
on
the
householder
that
he
used
the
words
i
quoted.
now,
i
don't
have
the
time
and
i
don't
suppose
it's
material
to
go
into
some
of
the
basic
facts.
edison
supplies
1,300,000
gas
customers,
mostly
small
ones
of
the
nature
of
the
act
is
intended
to
protect
2,000,000
of
electric
customers
and
quite
unusually,
it
supplies
steam
to
about
2000
customers,
but
those
customers
or
for
example,
rockefeller
center,
that
vast
complex
of
15
large
buildings,
is
one
customer.
the
heat
largely
from
the
steam
manufactured
at
waterside
with
the
x-20
gas
if
that
had
been
available,
goes
to
that
rockefeller
center
and
those
people
in
rockefeller
center
and
other
business
offices
and
departments
i
suppose,
are
small
people.
but,
i
mentioned
that
because
the
notion
that
edison
was
selfishly
trying
to
get
this
gas
and
that
that
the
charge
that
--
the
air
pollution
was
not
a
true
consideration,
it
was
a
makeweight.
edison,
from
its
own
selfish
economic
interest,
would
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
gas
it
has
to
purchase
from
transco
and
other
pipelines
for
resale
to
the
public,
if
it
would
have
the
effect
that
is
suggested
here.
i
can't
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
pardon.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
it
is
an
electricity
and
a
steam
generating
station.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
it
sells
the
steam
itself.
it's
a
by
--
it's
a
bleeder
process
by
which
the
high
pressure
steam
is
used
in
the
electric
end
and
certain
amount
is
bled
off
and
by
pipes
run
to
all
of
midtown
new
york
in
order
to
prevent
separate
fuel
installations
in
all
these
buildings.
and
if
you
notice
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
said
they
couldn't
see
any
inferior
use
in
distributing
that
steam
from
the
central
station,
which
is
the
whole
electric
art,
or
and
in
the
gas
run
by
pipes
in
running
each
householder
and
apartment
building
have
its
own
apparatus.
i
--
i
--
there
is
so
much
been
said
about
the
record
on
this
air
pollution
question
that
i'd
just
like
--
or
i
get
to
the
real
legal
question.
just
like
to
make
one
or
two
observations.
an
unwary
reader
particularly
at
part
--
point
3
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
might
think
that
the
commission
was
weighing
evidence
for
and
against
this
problem
of
air
pollution.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
offered
on
the
subject,
except
by
the
officers
of
the
city
of
new
york
and
by
con
edison's
offices.
there
was
no
evidence
to
weigh
at
all.
now
that
bears
and
what
i
regard
is
the
less
question
to
be
reached,
the
utterly
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
reckless
character
of
the
commission's
action.
now,
i
do
want
to
say
one
thing
too
further
on
pollution
and
then
drop
it.
there's
a
bitter
attack
it
seems
to
me,
an
unwarranted
attack
on
the
testimony
of
dr.
greenburg.
he
was
the
director
of
the
air
pollution
of
new
york.
he's
probably
the
most
distinguished
scientist
in
the
world
in
this
field.
he's
a
physician,
an
engineer,
public
health
officer.
dr.
greenburg
is
not
the
typical
hired
professional
witness.
he
came
in
not
with
pat-statements.
he
came
in
with
his
heart
in
this
thing
and
he
talked
with
gravity,
like
a
man
making
a
plea.
he
said,
"i
can't
prove
that
this
pollution,
which
is
occurring
in
new
york
is
the
cause
of
the
lung
cancer,
but
i
think
there
is
a
great
reason
to
suspect
it."
now,
the
word
suspect
in
there,
the
indefiniteness
has
been
the
subject
of
an
attack.
well
naturally,
he
referred
to,
what
was
it,
4000
deaths
that
occurred
a
few
years
ago
over
in
one
week's
time
in
london,
because
of
air
pollution.
well
there
and
again
in
the
donora,
pennsylvania,
where
i
think
there
were
50
deaths,
the
mass
autopsies
was
able
to
establish
it
to
be
sure
that
couldn't
be
established.
but
what
was
established?
that
this
waterside
plant,
each
and
everyday,
pours
out
into
the
atmosphere
27,000
pounds
of
fly
ash
and
soot.
and
what
the
solicitor
general
failed
to
mention,
42,000
pounds
of
toxic
sulfur
dioxide.
they
--
in
the
attack
on
the
indefiniteness,
there
is
a
testimony
by
dr.
greenburg
of
the
collecting
station
that
are
all
over
new
york
city.
and
on
the
lured
side,
because
you
can't
put
the
stations
out
in
the
east
river,
on
the
lured
side,
they
make
a
great
point
as
to
wind
direction.
it
shows
a
pollution
--
i
mean,
a
deposit
that
is
sought,
which
had
been
microscopically
examined
and
connected
with
the
soot
coming
out
of
these
chimneys
of
waterside,
it
--
of
many
times
that
occurring
at
any
other
place
in
the
city.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
are
four
decisions
that
bear
on
this
question.
briefly,
our
point
is
that
section
1
(b)
of
the
act
is
the
jurisdictional
section.
the
other
sections,
i
think,
are
fairly
described
as
operational
sections.
once
you
have
the
jurisdiction
established
and
one
day
grants
jurisdiction
over
to
transportation
of
natural
gas
or
the
sale
for
resale
of
natural
gas
or
natural
gas
companies.
and
then,
as
this
court
had
occasion
to
say
in
panhandle,
the
indiana
public
service
commission
in
1947
that
this
legislation
in
1
(b)
is
of
unusual
legislative
precision,
because
then
it
goes
on
with
a
prohibition
against
regulation
in
any
other
field.
and
this
court
said
and
i'd
like
to
read
these
two
short
sentences,
"the
omission
in
section
1
(b)
of
any
reference
to
other
sales,
that
is
direct
sales
for
consumptive
use
in
the
affirmative
declaration
of
coverage,
was
not
advertent,
it
was
deliberate."
congress
made
sure
its
intent.
it
could
not
be
mistaken
by
adding
the
explicit
provision
that
the
act
shall
not
apply
to
any
other
sale,
direct
sales
for
consumptive
use
of
whatever
sort,
were
excluded.
i
am
reading
from
the
decision
in
the
panhandle,
the
indiana
public
service
commission,
332
u.s.
507.
i
--
it's
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
--
i
think
it's
about
page
40
--
no,
it
isn't.
it's
–
it's
referred
to
at
pages
18,
26
and
29.
i
think
the
first
time
we
had
rather
full
quotes.
then
another
case
that
we
rely
on,
that
solicitor
general
has
mentioned,
is
the
hope
case.
hope
was
a
rate
case.
it
was
under
operative
sections
4
and
5
of
the
natural
gas
act
relating
to
rates.
the
state
of
west
virginia
having
large
interest
in
natural
gas,
coal,
and
oil
intervened.
it
sought
to
--
it
objected
to
the
rate
schedule
the
federal
power
commission
had
prescribed,
and
it
objected
because
it
wanted
a
high
rate
for
industry
in
order
to
promote
the
conservation
of
its
resources.
now,
the
majority
writing
to
mr.
justice
douglas
held
specifically
that
the
operative
rate
sections
could
not
be
perverted
to
invade
a
jurisdiction
which
congress
had
withheld
from
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
what
--
what
you
did,
mr.
justice
douglas,
is
just
this
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
you
--
you
referred
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
you
referred
--
that's
right.
you
--
you
said
that
the
--
that
the
rate
section
meant
the
rate
fixing
in
a
normal
sense,
and
to
try
end
use
it
for
a
conservation
purpose
of
controlling
end
use,
was
not
a
proper
construction
of
the
statute.
that
you'd
have
to
--
that
have
to
go
to
congress
to
get
the
support
for
that,
but
then
you
did
say
whether
it's
dictum
or
not.
you
did
say
that
under
the
transportation
or
certificate
section
7,
that
conservation
might
be
considered.
now,
you
referred
to
the
1942
amendment
and
--
i
see,
i
have
five
minutes.
i
--
i
think
i'd
better
refer
to
that,
that
1942
amendment
had
three
objectives.
one
was
to
give
the
commission
power
to
pass
on
the
certification
of
all
expansion
of
pipeline
not
just
in
the
competitive
areas
it's
had
been.
two,
it
was
to
give
the
commission
power
to
consider
in
granting
the
certificate,
initial
breaks.
in
other
words,
your
decision
recently
in
catco,
which
we
do
not
have
any
quarrel
with,
that's
a
sale
for
resale,
where
you
have
said
that
under
those
circumstances
initial
rates
could
be
prescribed,
is
soundly
founded
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
1942
amendment.
now,
the
third
thing
was
that
the
commission
might
consider
the
interest
of
the
producers
or
carriers
of
competing
fuels.
now,
in
that
sense,
of
course
that
was
a
conservation
element
and
therefore,
i
think
the
--
if
i
read
mr.
justice
douglas'
wording
in
hope,
in
referring
to
that,
that
he
was
referring
to
that
element
of
conservation,
then
i
--
whether
it's
dictum
or
not,
i
think
it's
entirely
correct,
entirely
supported
by
the
history
and
i
think
that's
the
way
it
should
be
read.
now,
i
--
time
does
not
permit,
there
was
another
fourth
case
--
another
panhandle
one
in
1951,
where
the
question
is
whether
michigan
could
regulate
these
direct
sales
and
this
court
upheld
the
power
of
michigan
and
said
that
the
federal
power
commission
had
no
such
power.
and
the
last
case,
which
is
really
very
close
in
point
and
solves
any
question
that
may
in
the
hope
case,
again
it
was
the
panhandle
case
in
337
u.s.,
where
the
certain
gas
leases
had
been
included
in
the
pipeline
certificate
as
reserves.
the
company
then
tried
to
sell
the
gas
leases.
the
commission
tried
to
block
or
foil
that
sale
and
this
court
held,
it
had
no
such
power.
and
in
that
connection,
this
court
stated
specifically
that
their
certificate
provision
section
7
could
not
be
used
as
an
indirect
means
to
violate
or
invade
an
area
which
section
1
(b)
had
prohibited.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
--
i
think
i
can
answer
your
honors
question
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
yes.
that
--
that's
it.
i
--
i
think
i
can
answer
even
more
narrowly.
the
--
you
cannot
construe
an
operative
section,
like
7,
to
violate
the
expressed
prohibition
governing
the
jurisdiction
in
section
1
(b)
and
that's
what
this
case
is.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
the
purchase
contract
could
not
become
effective
unless
we
could
get
gas
from
texas
to
new
york.
i
haven't
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
haven't
read
the
reporting
of
it
for
some
years
and
i
can't
be
more
specific
than
that.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
that's
right,
except
for
conservation
regulation
of
the
sale,
of
course.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
say
that
all
there
is
in
this
case,
the
con
edison
made
an
exempt
purchase
and
he
could
use
that
gas
for
any
purpose
it
wanted.
it
turned
to
transco,
instead
of
building
its
own
pipeline
under
the
montana
case
doctrine,
to
build
extra
facilities,
nothing
to
interfere
with
anybody
else,
and
i
say
that
the
commission,
in
denying
that
certificate
for
reasons
having
no
relation
whatsoever
to
the
transportation
function,
was
attempting
to
exert
a
jurisdiction
which
congress
had
deliberately,
as
this
court
has
held
at
least
four
occasions,
deliberately
withheld
from
it
in
the
scope
of
its
jurisdiction.
and
i
say
that
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
that
the
solicitor
general
has
advanced,
disregards
to
the
fact
that
in
each
and
every
year
in
the
last
decade,
this
commission
has
gone
in
different
words
to
the
congress
and
asked
for
the
power
that
it
tried
to
exert
here
and
congress
maybe
because
of
the
pendency
of
an
attempt
to
draw
a
national
fuels
policy,
maybe
for
other
reasons,
congress
denied
it,
because
senator
magnuson,
at
his
request
in
the
year
1959,
they
put
in
a
bill,
which
would
give
this
commission
the
power
to
do
the
--
to
control
the
uses
as
to
whether
they
were
in
the
public
interest.
and
congress
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
say
that
the
statute
expressly
prohibits
regulation
in
that
area.
and
i
say
that
the
action
of
the
commission
was
intended
in
violation
of
antitrust
laws
which
are
not
defended
here
at
all.
it
was
intended
and
deliberately
and
they
so
state
to
give
a
monopoly
to
the
pipelines
and
never
to
allow,
any
and
the
solicitor
general
in
the
opening
sentence
of
his
reply
brief,
argues
that
no
out
of
state
purchaser
should
come
to
a
production
state
and
buy
gas.
it
would
strike
down
the
montana
doctrine
as
well,
of
course.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
let
me
answer
that
and
i
don't
want
to
transgress
on
my
friend's
time,
the
counsel
for
transco.
i
say
that
they
may
consider
commission
in
issuing
a
certificate,
may
consider,
look
at
non
jurisdictional
factors.
take
the
very
simple
thing,
all
gas
producers
are
--
oil
producers
and
vice
versa.
now,
one
of
the
great
headaches
that
the
federal
power
commission
caused
in
the
tremendous
delay
in
its
functioning
under
the
gas
act
is
trying
to
fix
rates
where
they
have
to
allocate
cost
between
gas
and
oil.
now,
i
say
that
it's
perfectly
proper
for
the
federal
power
commission
to
consider
oil
cost
in
order
to
effectively
regulate
the
gas
cost.
that's
proper,
it's
a
non-jurisdictional
fact,
but
it's
properly
considered.
but
i
do
not
say
because
of
that,
that
the
commission
may
direct
that
oil
company
to
do
something
which
is
regulating
the
oil
business
which
hasn't
been
vested,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
x-20
case
is
about.
they
don't
--
they're
not
interested
in
the
transportation.
it's
a
device
to
fraud.
they're
trying
solely
to
block
the
sale
to
use
their
own
words.
we
attempted
to
foil
the
sale
of
the
texas
producers,
con
edison.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
oh
yes,
i
am
very
well.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
it
has
in
every
case,
where
our
–
and
there's
a
foundation
that
i
haven't
time
to
get
into,
of
gross
discrimination
in
this
case.
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i
--
i
say
this.
the
new
--
our
briefs
cites
the
case
and
it
can
be
checked
for
accuracy.
i
believe
that
in
every
case
where
the
issue
of
a
sale
for
boiler
fuel
or
industrial
use
was
up,
the
commission
granted
the
certificate,
approved
it,
and
the
cases
like
the
texas
case
and
the
florida
case,
we
call
it,
that
went
up,
the
court
sustained
the
commission's
power
to
order
or
permit
the
sale.
now,
there
were
four
cases
where
it
denied
that
power.
three
of
them
it's
subsequently
granted
in
some
degree
and
the
fourth
one,
never
went
up
or
never
went
to
any
court.
and
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
every
case
that
i
know
of
before
the
commission
--
mr.
randall
j.
leboeuf,
jr.
they
have
granted
permission
for
boiler
fuel,
except
those
four
cases,
three
of
which
were
modified.
and
in
the
florida
case,
the
transportation
of
natural
gas
for
boiler
fuel
use
of
the
two
electric
utilities
in
florida,
was
volumes
many,
many
times
here
involved.
this
is
only
50,000
mcf.
out
of
10
billion
that
are
being
used
in
1959
for
several
purposes.
thank
you
your
honor.
