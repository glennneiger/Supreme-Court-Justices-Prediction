does
the
volume
of
x-20
gas
as
against
the
60-day
gas,
is
that
a
relevant
factor
in
your
--
in
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
it
depends
how
much
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
relative
--
the
relativity
volume?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
--
i
probably
don't
understand
this.
but
if
they
were
going
to
use
a
fraction,
in
a
sizable
fraction,
of
the
peaking
supply
in
relation
to
air
pollution,
then
that
is
just
so
much
more
in
order
to
deal
with
it
or
to
avoid
air
pollution.
then
they
add
that
on
to
the
main
claim
that
they
make,
that
they
bought
the
50,000
mcf.
for
that
purpose.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
thought
you
just
said
they
use
20
–
they
were
going
to
use
20,000?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
they
had
themselves
against
resale
potentially
by
the
60-day
provision.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
--
i
understand
and
i'd
like
to
know
too
justice
clark's
question.
was
the
quality
of
gas,
forget
the
price,
was
the
quality
of
gas
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
difference
between
validity
to
the
point
and
relevance
to
the
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
con
edison
have
any
interest
in
transco?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
it
would
be
--
amount
of
the
charge
to
be
relevant
mr.
leboeuf?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
it's
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
because
if
you
are
right,
am
i
wrong
in
taking
if
you're
right
in
any
arrangement
that
con
edison
made
with
transco
is
irrelevant
to
the
problem
of
regulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
be
a
burden
in
the
sense
of
being
discriminatory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
not
with
the
wyoming
case.
was
it
wyoming
that
you
referred
to
me
a
minute
ago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
montana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
montana
built
its
own
pipeline
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
it's
none
of
the
business
of
the
commission
whether
it
did
it
extravagantly
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
waste
of
money,
so
that
it
does
make
a
difference
if
you
have
an
intervening
independent
transportation
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
your
--
the
core
of
your
argument
that
the
commission
and
without
power
to
withhold
a
certificate
under
section
7
to
be
granted
in
the
public
interest,
in
the
public
interest
not
being
particularized,
it
can't
withhold
that
certificate
because
the
purchased
gas,
which
it
is
carrying,
was
being
carried
for
a
purchaser,
whose
purchase
is
not
subject
to
regulation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
--
was
the
purchase
contract
conditioned
upon
a
grant
of
a
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
it
isn't
--
you
simplify
the
situation
by
saying
that
con
edison
could
go
down
to
the
field
and
buy
gas
and
then
dispose
of
it
as
it
treated
down
there
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
without
buy
or
lease?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
i'm
--
but
the
point
is
that
that
isn't
what
this
is.
this
is
the
purpose
in
the
field
which
requires
the
enjoinment
from
the
transportation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
saying
--
you're
saying
the
statute
implied
that
--
what
it
gets
down
to
is
that
the
statute
impliedly
prohibits
an
out
of
town,
a
long
distance
purchases
in
the
--
in
the
field
unless
it
uses
it
in
the
field
or
has
a
pipeline
of
its
own
or
carry
it
away
in
bucket.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
leboeuf
the
law,
as
it
can
be,
while
permitting
opinion
isolation,
doesn't
allow
the
opinion
isolation
to
be
hooked
up
with
something
else,
which
produces
a
different
situation.
that's
the
essence
of
what
you
decided
yesterday
in
totally
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
project
was
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said,
the
project,
you
mean
the
transportation
project?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
facility,
exactly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
there
another
problem
that
it
is
raised
by
the
question
just
put
by
justice
stewart?
if
the
only
reason
from
withholding
the
certificate
was
that
there
was
a
sale
--
a
sale
or
no
resale
purchase,
then
it
might
be
argued
that
the
denial
of
the
certificate
means
they're
going
to
use
the
certificating
power
in
order
to
prevent
--
to
prevent
what
otherwise
are
non-regulatable
sale,
non-sale
research.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
connor,
but
the
provision
as
to
the
large
undefined
phrase
that
is
required
by
the
present
or
future
public
convenience
and
necessity,
that
phrase
isn't
restricted
to
the
explicit
jurisdiction
or
power
of
the
commission,
that
includes
other
consideration,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
restrictions
–
can
you
find
the
restriction
to
be
in
section
1,
in
the
three
categories
of
regulatable
situations.
is
that
it?
in
1
(b)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
--
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
objection
--
the
objection,
the
cited
objection,
that
this
is
a
purchase
for
an
inferior
use
--
this
is
a
transaction
which
leads
to
an
inferior
use?
is
that
at
the
heart
of
the
business?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
--
there
are
priorities
and
anything
--
that
the
consumer
purchase
is
the
main
aim
of
the
statute
you
say.
and
anything
that
derogates
from
that
is
an
inferior
use.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
did
the
commission
find
that
the
inferior
use,
the
claim
of,
what
is
called
the
end
use,
air
pollution
was
a
(inaudible)
if
they
find
that
that
was
just
a
screen
and
a
pretense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
the
inferior
and
superior
were
not
written
into
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
written
into
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
it
a
fact
though
that
the
fact
that
the
purchase
was
not
regulable
was
an
important
consideration
in
denying
the
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
all
none
--
but
all
non
principle
cases,
non-resalable
sale
has
some
effect
on
the
industry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
specific
case
or
that
the
general
attitude
of
looking
a
sketch
at
large
non-regulable
purchases
in
the
field
that
the
commission
was
ruled
by.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
nobody
--
well
there's
no
pollution
problem,
never
mind
whether
it's
valid
in
this
case
or
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
there's
no
pollution
problem,
the
pollution
blame
can't
be
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
they
made
a
general
rule
that
no
large
scale
industrial
purchasers
in
the
field
for
non-resale
will
be
allowed.
they
couldn't
regulate
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
could
say,
we'll
give
no
certificate
to,
what
did
they
call
it,
carrier
to
transport
that
which
you
legally
bought,
they
could
do
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
you
may
recall,
i
do
not
recall
any
comparable
institute
in
the
field
of
--
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
whereby,
the
certificating
power
was
used
in
order
to
prevent
an
otherwise
congressionally
authorize
power
to
block
an
otherwise
specifically
authorized
congressional,
non-regulatable
power,
i
mean,
purchase
not
for
resale.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think,
they're
wrong,
all
i
am
saying
is
the
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
because
they
--
they
said,
the
purchase
by
con
edison
is
non-resalable,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
what
you're
arguing
here
is
that
the
convenience
and
necessity
power
of
the
commission
can
be
utilized
in
order
not
to
reference
to
itself,
but
primarily
and
predominantly
isn't
just
made
so
clear.
they
cleared
that
moments
ago,
predominantly,
to
prevent
an
exercise
of
power,
which
congress
has
authorized
people
to
exercise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
accepting
your
argument
that
this
would
be
adverse
to
the
natural
gas
industry,
but
that
which
is
adverse
specifically
allowed
by
congress
namely,
to
purchase
not
for
resale.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
can
purchase
but
they
--
they
have
the
legal
right
to
purchase,
but
they
can't
make
that
right
effective.
