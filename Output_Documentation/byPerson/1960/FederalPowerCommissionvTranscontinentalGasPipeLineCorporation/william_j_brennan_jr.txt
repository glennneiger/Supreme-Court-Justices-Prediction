justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
what
happens,
mr.
solicitor,
what
happens
to
the
x-20
gas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
not
been
delivered?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
or
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
is
there
a
condition
against
the
use
of
that
transco
gas
for
fuel
or
boilers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
transco
would
sell
it
or
edison?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
this
transco
gas,
i
gather,
the
price
of
that
is
regulable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
mean
this
is
significant
for
the
spending
of
gas,
significant
for
the
use
in
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor,
i
am
about
a
little
confused
and
much
confused.
but
i
don't
quite
understand
this.
i
thought
you
said
to
us
that
they
take
25,000
of
this
x-20
gas,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
the
maximum
that
they've
been
using
for
boiler
fuel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words
that
whole
50,000
that
they
get,
which
is
conditioned
for
use
only
as
boiler
fuel,
they
are
in
fact,
using
as
boiler
fuel?
none
of
that
can
be
resold,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
