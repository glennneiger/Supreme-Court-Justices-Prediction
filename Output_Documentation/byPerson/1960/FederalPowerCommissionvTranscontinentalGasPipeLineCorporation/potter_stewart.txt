justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
they
do
that
for
60
days?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
presumably
for
a
peak
period?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
is
kind
of
a
trial,
are
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
it's
unquestionable
of
course
that
the
commission
has
no
direct
power
as
such
over
the
--
over
the
use
by
customer
of
gas.
justice
potter
stewart
at
which
he
buys
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
for
transportation?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
if
this
gas
had
been
purchased
as
it
was
in
texas
by
consolidated
edison
and
transported
by
a
ship,
by
a
tanker
around
through
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
at
the
coast
of
new
york
and
delivered
to
consolidated
edison
up
there,
the
federal
power
commission
wouldn't
be
in
the
picture
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it
wouldn't
be
the
use
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
guess
it's
not
done,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
basic
issue
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
--
is
there
anything
in
this
record,
mr.
mcgrath
as
to
the
comparative
price
of
coal
and
this
gas
into
consolidated
edison
--
justice
potter
stewart
testimony.
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
--
the
facts
were
that
the
montana
power
company
built
its
own
pipeline
into
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
waterside
is
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
waterside
an
electricity
generating
station?
justice
potter
stewart
selling
the
steam
itself?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
it
was
said
somewhere
earlier
in
your
argument
that
if
--
that
if
the
commission
upheld
here,
consolidated
edison
would
find
it
impossible
to
get
this
boiler
gas,
but
actually
couldn't
they
do
it
just
by
the
method
you've
just
suggested
in
the
--
in
the
conventional
way
of
buying
from
the
department.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
for
direct
purchase?
justice
potter
stewart
the
florida
case.
justice
potter
stewart
purchase
of
the
pipeline.
