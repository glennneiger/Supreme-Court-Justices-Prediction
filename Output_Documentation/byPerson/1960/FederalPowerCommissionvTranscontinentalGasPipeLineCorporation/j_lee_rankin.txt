mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
natural
gas
act.
it
is
a
question
of
a
certificate
to
transport
gas
under
section
7
of
that
act.
the
particular
part
of
the
application
that's
involved
here
is
what
is
known
as
the
transportation
of
x-20
gas,
which
is
somewhat
unusual
and
i'll
try
to
describe
it.
under
the
tariff,
proposed
tariff,
the
x-20
was
gas
that
consolidated
edison
company,
new
york,
bought
directly
from
the
producers
in
texas
at
$19.25
for
1000
cubic
feet
to
have
transported
by
the
transcontinental
gas
pipe
line
corporation
to
new
york
city
with
the
restriction
on
the
use
of
the
gas
that
it
could
only
be
used
as
fuel
for
boilers.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
restriction
was
for
the
producers
to
avoid
any
regulation
of
the
price
of
their
gas.
the
examiner
in
considering
it
--
well
there's
a
further
factor
that
is
of
importance,
and
that
is
that
transco,
transcontinental
pipe
line
company,
agreed
that
for
a
period
of
60
days
at
the
election
of
consolidated
edison,
they
would
furnish
their
own
gas
that
could
be
used
for
resale
in
the
new
york
city
area,
to
consolidated
edison
in
the
portion
of
the
pipeline
that
had
otherwise
been
provided
under
this
x-20,
for
the
transportation
of
this
gas,
consolidated
edison
that
consolidated
edison
bought
directly.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
whatever
consolidated
edison
elected
to
do
so.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
that
is
what
is
called
the
peaking
gas.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
during
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that
isn't
delivered.
it's
what
they
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
is
not.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's,
what
they
call,
a
drawback
and
it's
though
the
pipeline
is
there
with
that
space
available
for
consolidated
edison
to
use
and
instead
of
using
the
x-20,
they
put
into
a
transco
gas
that
can
be
resold.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
it
--
it
can
be
resold.
it
could
be
used
for
boilers
too.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
but
the
purpose
of
it,
the
purpose
of
the
provision
is
to
be
able
to
resell
--
sell
it,
to
take
care
of
the
peak
loads
during
that
period
that
consolidated
edison
would
have.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
consolidated
edison
would
sell
it
in
the
new
york
market.
transco
would
merely
carry
the
gas
but
it
would
be
gas
that
transco
purchased
itself
and
would
be
subject
to
resale,
as
distinguished
from
the
restriction
on
the
consolidated
edison
purchased
gas
which
could
not
be
resold
in
the
new
york
market
but
had
to
be
used
according
to
the
terms
of
purchase
for
a
boiler
fuel.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
is
regulable,
yes.
and
there
was
a
general
tariff
covering
that.
but
the
tariff
that
they
--
that
consolidated
edison
purchased
that
gas
under
was
one
in
--
that
was
interruptible.
that
is
they
had
a
right,
transco
had
a
right
to
take
the
regular
gas
of
what's
called
cd
under
the
tariff
and
interrupt
the
consolidated
edison
being
able
to
have
that
gas
in
order
that
they'd
be
able
to
put
it
in
storage
during
a
part
of
the
year.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
it
is
because
of
the
peaking
provision
to
understand,
because
that
was
one
of
the
reasons,
the
justifications,
by
consolidated
edison
and
transco
for
having
this
arrangement.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
does
seem
important
as
to
whether
or
not,
air
pollution
was
truly
an
important
part
of
the
consideration
in
this
matter.
and
i
think
that
as
i
develop,
that
you'll
see
that
the
air
pollution
was
an
explanation
or
a
justification
that
they
gave
for
wanting
this
particular
tariff
approved
by
this
transportation
certificate.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
did
not
loom
nearly
as
important
as
the
opportunity
to
be
able
to
buy
the
gas
direct
without
interference.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
becomes
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
becomes
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it
becomes
relevant
in
regard
to
how
they
might
use
it
for
air
pollution
that
they
really
meant,
that
air
pollution
was
important
in
this
consideration.
now
this
particular
volume
we're
talking
about
that
they
contracted
for,
was
50,000
mcf.
of
gas
per
day
that
they
could
--
they
bought
in
texas
under
this
price
of
$19.25,
to
be
used
for
boiler
fuel.
there,
they
had
a
provision
that
they
could
get
during
the
peaking
period
for
the
60
days
at
their
election
up
to
50,000,
the
same
amount,
from
transco
of
resalable
gas.
their
testimony
was
that
they
were
going
to
use
only
25,000
because
they
were
going
to
use
25,000
of
the
x-20
gas
that
they
bought
themselves
in
the
boilers,
in
two
boilers
at
water
side,
in
order
to
take
care
of
the
air
pollution
and
the
rest,
they
would
proceed
to
use
for
resale
for
their
peaking
purposes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
it's
clear
in
the
record
that
they
didn't
intend
to
use
this
peaking
gas
from
transco
for
air
pollution.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
25,000,
but
that
was
still
the
same
gas
that
they
had
purchased
directly
from
the
producers
at
$19.25
and
that
they
had
to
use
for
boilers.
now
what
they
used
over
the
25,000
was
going
to
be
gas
that
they
could
resell,
and
they
wanted
to
have
the
benefit
of
that.
and
it
was
a
beneficial
transaction
to
them
because
that
would
help
them
at
least
to
the
extent
of
25,000
mcf.
to
take
care
of
the
greater
demands
of
their
consumers
in
the
new
york
market
for
gas
that
could
be
burned
by
the
consumers.
that
is
gas
for
resale.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
and
that
was
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
it's
all
the
same
burnable,
but
there
was
no
restriction
on
the
resale
as
to
the
$19.25
gas,
the
x-20
gas.
and
the
gas
they
would
get
from
transco
could
be
resold.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
apparently.
there's
no
dispute
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
difference.
it's
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
now
the
record
is
also
clear
although
it
is
not
involved
in
this
particular
case,
but
it
has
important
bearing
upon
the
decision
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
the
program
was
within
two
years
to
increase
this
x-20
gas
that
they
would
buy
directly
and
then
have
a
restricted
use
of
it
to
a
120,000
mcf.
that
is
from
50
--
70,000
mcf.
more
within
a
two
year
period.
but
--
and
it
was
inferred
at
first
that
they
would
use
this
to
take
care
of
some
more
of
the
air
pollution
problem.
but
the
testimony
was
that
when
they
got
the
whole
120,000
mcf.
of
the
x-20
gas,
they
would
still,
during
certain
periods
of
the
year,
use
only
25,000
for
air
pollution
purposes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
it
cannot.
but
there
would
be
--
during
the
peaking
period,
they
wouldn't
take
the
whole
50,000.
during
part
of
the
year
except
the
peaking
period,
they
would
take
the
50,000
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
--
and
use
it
for
boiler
fuel.
they
were
using
large
amounts
of
boiler
fuel
other
than
for
air
pollution
at
other
stations.
and
this
particular
station
involved
here,
well
there
are
two
of
them
on
the
east
river,
one
at
40th
and
the
east
river
near
the
united
nations
building,
which
would
need
50,000
to
take
care
of
eight
boilers
that
were
bad.
two
of
those
were
the
only
ones
that
there
was
a
--
there
wasn't
even
a
violation
of
the
ordinance,
but
they
were
worst
and
they
would
--
they
were
the
real
problem
and
they
take
25,000
mcf.
to
take
care
of.
the
others
were
probably,
it's
a
business
reason
for
getting
the
others
also
to
take
care
of
gas
according
to
the
record
or
to
have
them
burn
the
gas
in
the
boilers,
because
the
record
is
clear
that
the
71
and
72
boilers
are
the
ones
that
are
making
the
fly
ash
difficulty
that
is
bothersome
to
the
city.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
do
think
there
is
a
problem
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
don't
think
that
in
the
base
--
in
regard
to
the
basic
issue
that
air
pollution
is
anything
except
something
too
confusing,
because
i
don't
think
there's
any
validity
to
the
point.
on
the
other
hand,
i
did
feel
that
i
had
to
deal
with
it
because
there
is
an
act
to
the
congress
that
says
that
the
united
states
has
appropriated
$5,000,000
to
cooperate
with
the
states,
that
the
states
have
a
primary
obligation
about
air
pollution
and
whatever
research
could
be
developed,
in
that
regard,
the
united
states
would
cooperate
and
then
the
president
of
the
united
states
issued
the
executive
order
in
which
he
directed
that
people
in
the
united
states
government
cooperate
with
the
states
and
cities
to
see
that
whatever
could
be
done
about
our
own
industry
that
is
governmental
industries,
did
not
contribute
to
air
pollution.
so
i
thought
there
was
a
duty
to
try
to
show
to
the
court
that
air
pollution
was
not
a
real
problem
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
i
view
that
mr.
justice.
but
i
think
that
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
this
end
use,
that
is
the
difference
between
the
use
of
gas
for
boiler
fuel
which
is
considered
as
an
inferior
use
was
so
determined
by
the
federal
trade
commission
report
in
1936
which
this
court
has
said,
and
it's
recited
in
the
1938
natural
gas
act,
was
the
reason
for
the
natural
gas
act
to
be
passed.
and
on
the
--
on
the
considerations
of
conservation,
the
superior
use
as
compared
with
the
inferior
use,
and
whether
that
can
be
considered
by
the
commission
in
regard
to
determining
whether
certificates
should
be
issued,
is
the
basic
issue
in
this
case.
now
the
commission
did
determine
that
it
would
not
issue
a
certificate
in
this
case,
and
this
is
a
section
7
application,
i
want
to
make
it
clear.
it's
not
a
rate
case
application.
it's
a
certificate
for
transportation
in
which
section
7
comes
into
play.
and
the
commission
held
that
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
there
were
four
basic
reasons
why
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
that
condition
as
provided
in
section
7,
this
--
at
this
certificate
could
not
be
required
by
the
public
interest
--
by
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
because,
first,
they
felt
it
would
breakdown
the
practice
over
a
period
of
some
20
years
of
the
purchase
of
gas
and
resale
by
the
transmission
companies
and
would
be
damaging
to
that
established
price.
secondly,
they
felt
that
it
would
inflate
prices
in
competition
to
have
these
various
large
users
go
into
the
marketplace
and
bid
against
the
pipelines
to
require
gas
and
resell
it
in
this
manner.
and
it
would
drive
the
prices
up.
third,
they
said
that
the
small
consumers
wouldn't
have
the
buying
power
to
engage
in
any
such
practices
as
this
and
they
would
be
forced
to
have
--
to
acquire
their
purchases
through
the
transmission
companies
of
the
pipelines
in
the
same
way
and
would
be
adversely
affected
by
the
fact
that
prices
and
the
pipeline
gas
would
be
driven
up,
but
they
couldn't
compete
by
going
out
and
trying
to
get
the
gas
at
the
lesser
price.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
they
further
took
the
position,
this
was
an
inferior
use
that
the
pollution
issue
was
not
a
valid
one
under
the
showing
made,
and
that
it
was
therefore,
not
justified
under
their
prior
holdings
and
positions
that
boiler
use
is
an
inferior
use
unless
there's
special
justifications,
there
should
not
be
--
that
use
should
not
be
certificated.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
--
there
was.
the
price
that
they
paid
in
the
field
was
higher,
$19.25.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
the
gas
for
--
that
cd
gas,
the
transco
sold
generally
for
resale,
was
based
on
accumulation
of
a
number
of
prices
that
they
put
together
over
the
years
of
the
--
substantially
below
that.
the
commission
was
trying
to
hold
gas
in
this
particular
area
where
consolidated
edison
went
in
and
bought
and
paid
$19.25.
they
were
trying
to
hold
it
below
18
cents.
consolidated
edison,
in
order
to
get
this
large
chunk
of
gas
under
these
terms
that
would
not
be
regulated,
went
in
and
bid
$19.25
and
got
it.
and
that
had
the
effect
of
lifting
prices
in
that
area.
the
--
the
testimony
from
transco
on
the
other
hand,
was
that
they
couldn't
--
they
did
not
dare
try
to
buy
this
gas
at
--
in
competition
with
consolidated
edison
and
i
think
the
inference
is
fair,
probably
lower
than
even
$19.25,
because
it
would
escalate
other
prices
they
had
on
gas.
but
there's
no
question
to
what
they
paid
substantially,
above
the
general
market
that
the
pipelines
had
been
paying
for
this
gas,
but
the
producer
said,
“we
don't
want
any
regulation
as
a
part
of
it.”
and
they
gave
them
that
part
of
the
agreement
so
they
wouldn't
get
regulated
and
agreed
to
use
it
for
this
limited
purpose.
now,
it's
also
clear
this
doesn't
help
transco
at
all
on
getting
its
load
factor
railings
like
this
type
of
gas
sometimes
does
where
there's
a
direct
purchase
and
its
run
through
the
pipeline.
it
doesn't
help
on
that
kind
of
a
thing.
it
does
give
them
more
money,
because
they
get
paid
a
fair
price
and
there's
no
controversy
about
that
for
transporting
the
gas.
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
commission
and
held
that
it
had
no
right
because
of
what
it
said
the
legislative
history
was,
to
consider
the
conservation
factors
that
is
the
end
use
of
the
gas
in
any
way,
that
if
could
--
couldn't
consider
whatever
was
done
about
buying
the
gas.
it
couldn't
consider
whatever
was
done
about
the
use
of
the
gas.
the
only
thing
it
had
a
right
to
do
was
consider
whether
or
not
the
gas
could
be
transported,
and
it
said
that
in
regard
to
that,
it
was
to
examine
the
conventional,
as
it
described
it,
factors.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
so
held,
it
disregarded
the
true
legislative
history
of
this
act.
in
the
first
place,
the
1938
act
was
passed
as
you
will
recall,
with
a
provision
that
the
commission
would
have
jurisdiction
of
certificate
cases
in
regard
to
transportation
only
where
there
was
another
gas
line
--
transmission
line
in
the
area
and
it
would
not
have
in
other
cases.
now,
it
was
found
in
1942
that
that
was
--
in
the
experience
up
to
1942,
but
that
was
not
an
adequate
solution
for
the
problems
in
the
industry.
and
there
was
a
considerable
--
there
were
recommendations
that
the
conservation
factors
of
having
a
number
of
lines
come
in
to
a
particular
area
could
not
be
adequately
dealt
with.
there
were
also
the
factors
of
the
other
fuel
interests
and
the
transportation
interest
of
other
fuels,
were
not
permitted
to
intervene
under
the
1938
act
and
present
a
showing
as
to
the
fact
that
coal
or
the
transportation
of
coal
could
adequately
take
care
of
the
fuel
needs
of
a
particular
proposal
of
a
certificate
or
application.
and
therefore,
that
factor
could
not
be
properly
taken
into
account
by
the
commission
the
commission
had
so
taken
that
position
in
some
of
its
holdings.
and
so
that
congress,
with
expressed
reference
to
conservation,
had
amended
the
act
so
as
to
make
it
possible
for
the
commission
to
go
into
any
application
for
extension
or
new
transmission
lines
wherever
there
was
application,
wherever
there
was
an
attempt
to
do
that.
and
also,
to
allow
the
intervention
of
other
fuel
interests
and
transportation
interests
to
show
that
other
fuels
could
be
used
to
greater
advantage
and
conserve
the
gas.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
upon
the
1944
statement
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
regard
to
conservation
in
which
it
had
said
in
a
report
to
congress
that
it
didn't
have
the
comprehensive
right
to
control
conservation
and
disregarded
the
footnote
to
that
statement,
which
was
clearly
set
out
to
the
effect
that
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
control
the
direct
sales
to
industry
or
to
suspend
the
rates
on
indirect
sales
to
industry
through
the
pipeline.
and
it
made
it
explicit
that
it
was
the
comprehensive
control
of
these
other
things
that
it
needed.
and
in
1944,
the
same
year,
the
federal
power
commission
in
reporting
on
a
resolution
by
the
senate,
which
suggested
a
complete
examination
or
investigation
by
the
federal
power
commission
into
conservation
of
gas
and
other
fuels.
in
reporting
on
that,
the
federal
power
commission
expressly
told
the
senate
committee
that
it
had
the
power
to
regulate
and
it
considered
the
end
use
under
in
certificate
cases,
and
that
it
needed
this
comprehensive
power
to
consider
--
to
be
able
to
protect
conservation
in
regard
to
direct
sales
to
industry
and
suspension
of
rates
on
indirect
sales.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
and
indirect
sales
where
they
can't
suspend
it,
even
though
there
is
a
certificate
and
they
go
under
section
5
for
a
regulation.
so
that,
the
commission
was
explicit
about
this,
then
time
after
time,
they
have
taken
a
similar
position
and
they
have
reported
the
various
cases
they've
taken,
the
fact
that
they
asserted
the
right
to
consider
the
end
use
of
the
product
in
regard
to
inferior
and
superior
uses
of
gas
and
made
a
claim
that
they
considered
boiler
fuel
as
the
federal
trade
commission
had
said,
an
inferior
use.
now,
the
practices
of
the
commission
were
that
they
did
allow
certificates
for
boiler
fuel
in
various
situations
and
those
are
set
out
in
detail
in
the
brief.
but
there
had
to
be
a
special
justification
for
the
use,
this
inferior
use,
or
they
would
not
allow
it
and
some
of
the
special
justification
was
in
a
transco
case.
transco,
in
its
earlier
applications,
made
justification
showing
that
they
needed
the
right
to
sell
for
industrial
purposes
in
order
to
bring
the
rates
down
to
their
resales
to
other
consumers,
because
of
the
lack
of
volume
during
their
valley
periods
or
their
low
periods
in
regard
to
resalable
gas.
and
therefore,
they
justified
on
that
basis,
but
even
then,
the
commission
said
to
the
time
after
time,
you
should
get
busy
and
establish
some
storage,
so
you
don't
have
to
sell
all
this
gas
for
this
inferior
purpose.
but
you
can
put
it
in
storage
during
your
valley
periods
and
then
sell
it
out
during
the
peak
periods,
sold
to
the
consumers
for
the
highest
use,
and
therefore,
conserve
the
gas.
and
they
pressured
transco
time
after
time
on
that
and
finally
in
this
application
for
the
first
time,
transco
has
come
forward
with
what
was
called
the
leidy
storage
project.
now,
this
proposal
is
damaging
to
that
project
amongst
other
things,
because
it
doesn't
conceive
that
this
particular
gas
that
they
will
get
during
the
60-day
peaking
period
or
during
the
other
period
that
they
use
this
part
of
the
pipeline
which
is
the
valley
period,
will
go
into
the
leidy
reservoir,
but
it'll
be
used
for
the
special
advantage
of
consolidated
edison
under
this
x-20
tariff.
but
the
commission
had
insisted
constantly
as
one
example
of
their
position
that
transco
get
more
into
the
storage
business
for
the
conservation
of
gas
and
it
finally
come
around
to
that
point.
now,
they'd
also
allowed
it
for
the
atomic
energy
plant
at
oak
ridge.
they've
allowed
it
for
other
installations
where
they
needed
to
raise
the
amount
of
their
volume,
so
as
to
reduce
the
price
of
the
gas
generally
to
the
consumer.
they
had
allowed
it
for
special
industrial
purposes,
where
it
was
shown
that
the
gas,
itself,
would
form
chemical
compound
or
help
in
that
regard
with
the
--
in
the
manufacture
and
so
had
a
contribution
other
than
just
the
use
for
the
purpose
of
producing
steam,
which
is
a
low
value
use
as
far
as
the
amount
of
return
from
the
btus
in
it,
and
each
of
those
situations
we
have
analyzed
at
some
length.
now
in
regard
to
the
legislative
history,
there's
also
expressed
specific
examples
where
the
congressmen
had
come
forward
with
the
proposal
to
prohibit
the
commission
from
considering
end
use,
four
different
times
and
the
congress
had
not
yet
allowed
it.
