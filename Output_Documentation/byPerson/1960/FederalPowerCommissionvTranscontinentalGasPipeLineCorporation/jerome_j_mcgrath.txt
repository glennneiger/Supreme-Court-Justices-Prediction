mr.
jerome
j.
mcgrath
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
advert
to
one
preliminary
matter,
it
was
brought
up
by
the
solicitor
and
in
the
questioning
of
mr.
justice
brennan,
having
to
do
with
the
cd-3
gas
as
compared
to
the
x-20
gas,
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
con
edison's
and
transco's
application
here.
now
the
cd-3
gas
is
so-called
contract
demand
gas,
which
the
distributor,
served
by
the
pipe
line
company,
can
use
for
distribution,
for
resale
to
the
general
consuming
public.
however,
it
has
a
limitation
in
the
tariff
which
restricts
the
use
of
that
gas
as
boiler
fuel
to
a
certain
limited
volume
per
day.
so
that
the
pipeline
company
can
take
that
gas
end
use
it
for
storage
purposes
during
the
warmer
periods
of
the
year.
now,
because
of
that
specific
limitation
in
transco's
tariff
in
the
cd-3
--
under
the
cd-3
rate,
it
was
precluded
from
using
the
25,000
mcf.
of
that
per
day
in
the
boilers
at
the
waterside
station
in
boiler
71
and
72.
now,
under
the
x-20
transportation
arrangement,
transco
is
given
the
privilege
which
none
the
other
customers
of
the
pipeline
company
have
to
not
only
have
the
x-20
transportation
gas
but
equivalent
volumes
on
a
60-day
basis
of
cd-3
gas
unrestricted
as
to
use.
in
other
words,
the
boiler
fuel
limitation
is
removed
and
so
is
the
restriction
that
the
producers
imposed
on
the
x-20
gas
removed,
so
that
it
can
be
distributed
to
the
general
public.
mr.
jerome
j.
mcgrath
it
--
it
has
this
to
do
only
mr.
justice
stewart
that
con
edison
seems
to
place
great
emphasis
and
did
so
at
the
commission
in
trying
to
promote
this
x-20
arrangement,
otherwise,
i
don't
say
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
specific
issue
that's
before
the
court
today.
the
--
adverting
now
to
the
ruling
of
the
third
circuit.
the
third
circuit's
ruling
is
much
broader
and
transcends
the
particular
issues
that
are
in
this
case
today.
the
ruling
of
the
third
circuit
is
that
the
commission
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
consider
end
use
conservation
matters
in
its
--
in
the
exercise
of
its
certificate
powers
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now
that
not
only
applies
to
the
transportation
of
gas,
but
this
was
made
clear
in
the
lynchburg
case
decided
several
months
later,
it
applies
to
the
resale
gas
as
well.
the
decision
completely
ignored
as
the
solicitor
general
stated,
one
of
the
primary
objectors
of
the
1942
amendment
to
the
act.
now
this
court
will
recall
as
it
outlined
in
the
hope
case
that
the
1942
amendment
was
bought
about
at
the
insistence
of
the
commission,
competitive
fuel
industries,
the
gas
industry
itself,
because
of
the
specific
limitations
on
the
commission's
authority
under
the
old
act,
the
1938
act.
now
the
broadening
of
the
commission's
powers
in
1942
was
to
enable
the
commission,
number
one,
to
give
consideration
to
the
broad,
social,
and
economic
effects
of
the
use
of
various
fuels
with
which
natural
gas,
as
a
fuel,
would
be
competing
and
to
take
into
account
the
conservation
aspects
of
the
problem,
recognizing
that
natural
gas
was
an
exhaustible
natural
resource.
now
one
of
the
first
cases
that
came
up
under
the
act
was
the
kansas
pipe
line
and
gas
company
case
in
1938.
and
it
was
that
case
in
which
the
commission
held,
it
didn't
have
this
authority
and
it
was
that
case
which
brought
about
the
1942
amendment.
now
our
interest
in
this
case,
as
a
competitive
fuel,
is
that
congress
has
expressed
concern
over
the
fact
that
the
expansion
and
extension
of
natural
gas
lines
into
competitive
areas
may
have
an
impact
on
existing
fuel,
existing
methods
of
transportation,
which,
in
the
broad
overall
public
interest
to
the
united
states,
should
be
given
consideration.
now
if
the
third
circuit's
ruling
is
to
be
upheld,
that
would
strike
out
completely
any
authority
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
give
effect
to
end
use
considerations.
we
submit
--
mr.
jerome
j.
mcgrath
yes,
mr.
examiner.
there
was
a
testimony
of
the
--
mr.
jerome
j.
mcgrath
habit.
there
was
a
testimony
of
the
witness
thomas
which
set
forth
the
comparative
fuel
prices
and
it
indicated
that
the
cost
of
the
x-20
gas
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
42
cents
roughly
and
the
coal
that
was
used
at
the
waterside
station
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
about
$42.06
per
million
btu.
they
are
very
close
in
cost.
in
other
stations
of
consolidated
edison,
however,
coal
cost
range
anywhere
from
37
cents
per
million
btu
up
to
40
or
not
maybe
with
per
million
btu,
gas
cost,
the
valley
gas
that
they
use,
interruptible
gas
that
con
edison
use,
is
around
by,
if
i
am
correct,
about
34.5
cents
per
million
btu.
mr.
jerome
j.
mcgrath
yes.
yes,
sir.
yes,
i
would
say
that
your
honor,
yes,
sir.
now
the
particular
case
that
was
confronting
the
commission
in
this
proceeding
was
but
another
manifestation
of
a
new
trend
in
the
gas
industry
by
which
producers
of
gas
were
seeking
outlets
which
were
--
would
not
subject
them
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission.
as
this
court
would
recall
in
the
phillips
decision,
it
was
held
that
producers
who
sell
their
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale,
are
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction.
immediately
before
this
case
was
--
this
application
was
filed
with
the
commission.
the
commission
had
considered
a
similar
transportation
arrangement
that
of
houston
texas
gas
and
oil
corporation
to
bring
gas
to
under
florida.
florida
power
corporation,
florida
power
&
light
company
purchase
gas
in
the
field,
engages
the
pipeline
company
to
transport
it,
substantial
volumes
to
market,
and
that
was
an
effort
by
the
producers
to
get
around
fpc
jurisdiction.
at
the
time
this
case
was
pending,
transco
had
an
application
to
transport
gas
from
louisiana
to
virginia
electric
and
power
company
for
use
as
boiler
fuel
in
the
power
plant
of
virginia
electric
and
power
company
in
possum
point,
virginia.
duke
power
company,
as
the
record
shows,
was
negotiating
with
producers
for
transportation.
as
mr.
rankin
pointed
out,
the
public
service
electric
and
gas
company
was
thinking
about
doing
--
going
into
the
same
type
of
arrangement,
but
as
the
record
shows
in
the
testimony
of
the
witness
bonaface,
they
were
awaiting
to
see
what
the
commission
did
with
this
case.
long
island
lighting
company,
another
large
distributor
and
power
company
in
the
east,
was
negotiating
for
transportation.
all
of
which
would
have
had
a
serious
impact
on
the
coal
industry
by
a
reason
of
the
use
of
this
gas
in
electric
generating
stations,
which
is
by
far
the
largest
single
customer
for
coal.
now,
if
the
commission
is
precluded
from
giving
weight
to
these
factors,
from
measuring
in
the
public
interest
in
making
a
value
judgment
as
to
whether
the
use
of
natural
gas
as
boiler
fuel
is
required
by
public
convenience
and
necessity
taking
all
of
these
factors
into
account,
then
i
say
that
the
third
circuit
has
vitiated
the
1942
amendment
and
has
deprived
the
federal
power
commission
of
one
of
its
most
important
functions.
it
would
strip
the
commission
of
any
real
expertise.
as
the
--
as
the
third
circuit
ruled,
the
only
thing
the
commission
could
properly
evaluate
were
the
conventional
factors,
a
market,
a
gas
supply,
rates,
all
technical
factors
which
the
commission
could
merely
list
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
check
off
and
under
the
ruling
of
the
third
circuit,
would
be
compelled
to
issue
a
certificate.
now
under
section
7
(c)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
we
say
that
the
commission's
functions
go
beyond
the
conventional
factors,
these
so-called,
technical
requirements.
the
commission
must
give
consideration
to
other
aspects
of
the
public
convenience
and
necessity.
and
those
aspects,
congress
has
said
to
the
commission,
include
conservation,
impact
on
competing
fuels,
and
other
matters
that
are
not
so-called
technical
or
checklist
items
of
proof.
now,
the
respondent
transco,
in
its
briefs,
states
that
the
commission
--
or
that
third
circuit
was
right
and
that
the
commission
is
not
required
to
give
effect
to
these
policy
considerations
which
the
commission
did
take
into
account,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
says,
that
the
commission
should
have
taken
into
account
the
air
pollution
law
and
given
policy
effect
to
that
or
to
the
antitrust
laws,
which
are
filled
very
much
whoever
in
the
case,
but
they
say,
the
commission
should
have
given
them
some
effect.
well
if
that
isn't
exceeding,
the
balance
which
the
third
circuit
has
set,
that
i
don't
know
what
is.
now
much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
did
not
reach
a
rational
judgment
including
that
the
public
convenience
and
necessity
had
not
been
shown
because
of
this
so-called
air
pollution
argument.
but
we
submit
that
the
evidence
of
record
is
clear
that
the
air
pollution
argument
was
greatly
exaggerated,
that
the
company
had
other
means
by
which
to
solve
its
problem,
one
of
which
it's
doing
right
now.
for
years,
ever
since
gas
was
made
available
to
new
york
in
1951,
it
has
had
substantial
volumes
of
natural
gas,
on
a
valley
basis,
available
for
use
at
waterside.
and
it
did
not
make
use
of
that
gas
until
1959.
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
it
was
in
march
of
1959,
when
waterside
first
had
natural
gas
for
use
in
its
boilers.
now,
those
volumes
--
that
company
had
volumes
of
gas
available
to
it
all
those
years.
we
argued
on
the
record
that
the
problem
is
as
bad
as
you
say
it
is,
why
didn't
you
use
the
gas
that
was
available
to
you.
and
their
answer
was,
"well,
physically,
it
couldn't
be
done
but
we
didn't
have
a
pipe
down
into
the
station."
well,
they've
got
a
pipe
there
now
and
they're
using
these
substantial
volumes
of
gas.
mr.
jerome
j.
mcgrath
pardon.
mr.
jerome
j.
mcgrath
i
think,
it
would
probably
be
less,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
what
the
cost
of
the
facility
was,
but
if
they're
using
valley
gas,
under
the
cd-3
rate,
the
average
cost
is
less
than
the
x-20
gas.
we
submit
that
the
policy
considerations
which
the
commission
took
into
effect
were
well
within
its
legal
competence
to
make.
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
is
clear,
it
couldn't
be
clearer
than
that
the
commission
does
have
authority
to
consider
conservation
in
its
administration
of
the
natural
gas
act.
we
submit
at
this
court
itself,
in
the
hope
case
and
in
the
east
ohio
case,
found
no
problem
in
reaching
that
identical
conclusion,
that
is
that
the
1942
amendment,
by
broadening
the
act,
gave
the
commission
authority
to
deal
with
this
most
important
problem
in
the
public
interest.
we
submit,
therefore,
third
circuit's
ruling
is
an
error,
that
the
commission
probably
discharged
its
responsibilities
under
the
act,
that
the
decision
was
within
its
legal
of
competence,
and
that
its
orders
denying
a
certificate
application
to
the
pipeline
company
to
transport
its
boiler
fuel
gas
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
