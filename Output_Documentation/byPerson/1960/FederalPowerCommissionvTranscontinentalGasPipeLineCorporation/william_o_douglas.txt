justice
william
o.
douglas
i
haven't
looked
back
at
this
recently,
but
didn't
we
reserve
the
problem
under
section
1?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know,
we
refused
to
allow
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
consideration
of
rate
in
the
present
rate
structure.
justice
william
o.
douglas
are
you
acquainted
with
the
houston
texas
case,
houston
texas
gas
&
oil
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
can
--
how
is
that
distinguishable
from
--
there
i
gather
that
the
commission
authorized
what
it
refused
to
authorize
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
do
you
mean
to
say,
in
every
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
you
say
every
case,
then
you're
talking
about
the
three
cases
that
went
to
the
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
you
were
selling
gas,
i
mean
you,
i
mean
the
transcontinental
selling
gas
to
--
distributing
gas
or
bringing
gas
to
new
york
for
sale
in
the
retail
market,
you
could
consummate
this
transaction,
i
gather.
justice
william
o.
douglas
or
if
you
were
selling
to
a
distributing
company
that
was
selling
to
retailers
as
well
as
to
con
edison
that
would
be
alright,
i
suppose
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
your
own
time
then.
justice
william
o.
douglas
don't
let
me
interrupt
you.
justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
indicate
the
thing
that's
back
in
my
mind.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don't
know
this
industry
well
enough
to
know
what
percentage
of
the
total
natural
gas
is
produced
and
sold
to
industrial
users
today,
but
it
must
be
a
very
substantial
percentage,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so
the
policy
of
the
commission
is
not
to
prohibit
the
sale
of
gas
to
industrial
consumers.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
they
had
done
it
in
another
way
they
could
do,
con
edison
could
do
what
it's
doing
here,
it
bought
through
an
intermediary
company.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
is
it
--
is
it
the
question
of
the
inferior
users,
or
is
it
the
question
of
doing
it,
provided
that
you
do
it
through
a
company
that
is
regulated?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
know.
that's
--
that's
something
like
this
thing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
con
edison,
that
the
officers
of
con
edison,
were
about
to
go
to
prison
for
polluting
the
air
and
that
was
no
other
way
to
prevent
it
except
this
and
you'd
say
the
commission
would
be
authorized
to
â€“
you
would
be
here
justifying
the
commission's
grant
of
a
certificate
of
this
kind.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
they
find
other
way,
but
they
didn't.
