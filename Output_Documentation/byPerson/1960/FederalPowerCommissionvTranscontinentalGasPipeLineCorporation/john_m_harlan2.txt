mr.
general,
now
suppose
in
this
air
pollution
issues
were
not
in
case
at
all
and
these
people
have
said,
"we
want
this
gas
for
boiler
purposes
and
not
resale
for
these
keepers
in
coal."
would
your
case
be
any
different?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
didn't
take
your
point
and
as
i
was
confused
as
to
with
all
the
talk
and
the
brief
was
and
that
you're
spending
time
on
knowledge
for
what
bearing
really
on
this
basic
issue,
the
air
pollution
issue
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
the
dissenting
commissioner
write
an
opinion,
i
don't
â€“
i
can't
find
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
where
is
that?
