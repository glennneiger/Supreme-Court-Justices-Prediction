mr.
richard
j.
connor
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
we
have
to
reemphasize
chiefly
in
connection
with
justice
frankfurter's
question
that
insofar
as
the
transportation
element
of
this
x-20
arrangement
was
concerned,
that
every
single
regulable
item,
connected
with
that
transportation,
was
specifically
gone
into.
the
commission
would
have
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not,
we
had
gas
to
back
it
up.
they
made
the
determination
that
we
had
the
gas.
they
would
have
to
inquire
as
to
whether
we
had
a
market
which
would
support
that
transportation.
they
found
that
we
had
a
firm
demand
and
market
for
the
gas.
they
then
would
have
to
determine
whether
our
facilities
were
physically
adequate
to
do
the
job.
they
made
the
determination
that
the
facilities
were
adequate.
they
then
had
to
make
a
determination
whether
the
whole
project
was
economically
feasible.
they
made
the
determination
that
it
was
feasible.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
yes,
the
transportation
project.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
these
are
our
facilities.
that
is
correct.
and
then
the
rate
was
fully
compensatory.
they
had
one
minor
tiny
little
exception
with
respect
to
an
insignificant
little
rate
aspect
which
the
government
concedes
is
not
a
part
of
this
case.
they
found
that
as
commissioner
hussey
in
his
dissent
noted,
that's
also
a
fact,
now
taken
issue
with
the
majority,
that
the
x-20
service
would
make
available
additional
volumes
of
gas
for
peaking
loads.
that's
the
60-day
gas
which
has
been
explained
and
re-explained
here.
and
then,
it
was
specifically
found
by
the
examiner,
and
this
is
important,
that
there
will
be
no
adverse
effect
on
transcontinental's
other
customers
or
transcontinental's
other
regulated
business.
and
then
as
it
has
been
indicated
here,
while
i
feel
that
at
the
point
i
just
suggested,
the
inquiry
on
this
particular
record
was
at
an
end
and
the
transco
should
have
been
granted
its
certificate,
we
went
further
in
what
might
be
surplusage
and
put
on
this
very
extensive
testimony
in
which
was
done
on
the
great
benefits
that
would
accrue
to
the
city
of
new
york
by
the
suppression
of
air
pollution.
now
the
commission
acknowledge
that
we
did
all
of
these
things,
but
they
said,
there
are
certain
policy
considerations,
which
militate
against
the
grant
of
this
certificate.
now
let
me
give
you
a
brief
history
as
far
as
the
record
is
concerned
in
respect
to
these
policy
considerations.
during
the
course
of
this
trial,
before
the
examiner,
there
was
only
a
single
issue
raised,
which
ultimately
became
one
of
the
five
policy
considerations.
and
that
issue
was
the
displacement
of
coal
or
what
is
then
loosely
called,
end
use.
now
we
knew
that
that
would
be
an
issue
because
mr.
mcgrath,
representing
the
coal
people
had
been
permitted
to
intervene
and
that
issue
was
cross-examined
by
mr.
mcgrath
extensively.
the
only
evidence,
as
mr.
leboeuf
has
told
you,
that
was
put
into
this
record,
was
put
into
the
record
by
transcontinental,
consolidated
edison
and
the
city
of
new
york.
no
other
evidence
was
put
into
this
record
by
anybody.
at
no
time
during
the
course
of
the
trial
of
this
proceeding,
was
any
issue
even
suggested,
vaguely
intimated,
or
hinted,
other
than
the
so-called
issue
of
displacement
of
coal
or
end
use.
none
of
these,
all
the
four
policy
considerations
that
i
will
come
to
shortly,
were
tried
on
the
record,
suggested,
or
even
remotely
intimated
in
the
course
of
the
record.
the
record
was
closed.
some
three
weeks
later,
the
commission
staff
brief
to
the
examiner
was
filed.
and
then
for
the
first
time,
there
was
recited
four
or
five
--
five
arguments
against
the
grant
of
certificate,
four
of
them
were
completely
novel.
one
of
them,
of
course,
was
end
use
or
boiler
fuel
use.
and
you
will
note
in
the
commission's
opinion
that
after
reciting
what
the
staff
and
the
coal
people
argued,
they
list
them
first,
second,
third,
fourth,
and
boiler
fuel
use,
the
commission
devotes
the
next
two
pages
to
merely
paraphrasing
those
contentions
of
counsel,
which
made
up
the
brand
new
four
policy
considerations,
adopts
them
as
their
own,
and
then
they
say,
that
taking
these
four
policy
considerations,
in
conjunction
with
end
use,
they
served
to
tip
the
balance
against
the
denial
of
the
certificate.
now
in
the
--
against
the
grant
of
the
certificate,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
without
going
specifically
to
the
record,
it's
in
the
order
denying
rehearing.
and
they
state
specifically
that
end
use
--
they
are
not
treating
as
determinative
of
this
case.
and
contrary
to
the
impression
that
is
brought
back
directly
here
would
seem
that
this
whole
case
turned
upon
end
use.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
turned
upon
what
has
been
called
end
use
of
the
gas.
i'll
now
proceed
to
take
up
each
of
the
so-called
denial
factors.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
yes,
he
did.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
215
in
the
volume
--
mr.
richard
j.
connor
it's
in
--
in
the
--
mr.
richard
j.
connor
now
the
first
of
these
novel
policy
considerations
was
that
if
the
commission
granted
this
request,
they
would
be
confronted
with
many
requests
of
the
same
general
character
and
granting
the
x-20
proposal,
they
would
have
no
fear
or
rational
basis
for
denying
similar
such
requests.
now,
we
assume
that
the
commission
is
talking
about
--
i
will
assume
first,
they're
talking
about
a
case
very
closely
analogous
to
this,
where
large
quantities
of
gas
are
being
bought
in
the
suppression
of
air
pollution.
i
submit
in
that
connection,
if
your
honor
please,
that,
yes,
there
are
other
cities,
probably
the
worst
affected
city,
is
the
city
of
los
angeles.
i
presume
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
new
york
is
probably
a
very
close
second.
and
we
may
have
similar
air
pollution
conditions
in
some
of
the
other
cities.
but
i
submit
in
that
regard
that
if
they
were
submitted
to
the
commission,
applications
for
the
use
of
gas
for
the
suppression
of
an
air
pollution
condition,
such
as
exists
in
new
york,
then
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
not
to
grant
the
use
of
gas
for
those
purposes.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
--
if
the
commission,
for
chances,
enlarging
its
thinking
to
include
the
typical
industrial
customer.
and
i'm
sure
that
in
the
opposition
briefs,
when
they
speak
of
this
great
insatiable
mark,
it's
going
like
a
gigantic
sponge
down
to
soak
up
all
the
available
gas
in
texas
so
that
not
a
single
thousand
cubic
feet
will
be
left
for
the
resale
market,
they
can
only
be
talking
about
the
broad
general,
what
i
call,
typical
industrial
market.
now
the
typical
industrial
market
buys
gas
for
one
purpose,
not
for
the
purpose
of
suppressing
air
pollution,
but
for
the
single
purpose
of
saving
dollars
and
cents.
very
frequently,
these
big
industrial
plants
will
have
two
or
three
valves,
an
oil
valve,
a
coal
valve,
and
a
gas
valve,
and
they
will
buy
the
fuel
that
is
the
cheapest
and
that's
the
sole
criterion
for
the
purchase.
now,
let's
pause
for
a
moment
and
see
how
colossal
this
market
is
or
is
going
to
be
in
the
light
of
the
constantly
rising
prices
of
gas
in
the
field.
in
the
very
midwestern
case,
talked
about
by
mr.
leboeuf,
midwestern
could
only
be
certificated,
because
the
competition
from
other
fuels
was
so
terrific.
it
could
only
be
certificated,
providing
it
sold
the
gas
that
it
purchased
from
its
parent
tennessee
at
a
lesser
price
than
it
actually
paid
to
its
parent.
and
commissioner
klein,
in
that
case,
dissented
and
took
the
position
that
he
felt
the
end
result
there
was
one,
where
the
domestic
and
the
small
commercial
consumer
was,
in
effect,
subsidizing
the
industrial
sales.
well
known
to
the
commission,
here
is
northern
natural
gas
company.
some
two
or
three
years
ago,
actually
lost
the
sale
of
a
boiler
fuel
load
to
the
council
bluffs
power
plant,
right
across
the
river,
from
its
own
offices
for
gas
laid
down
in
council
bluffs,
not
purchased
in
texas,
but
laid
down
in
council
bluffs
at
22
cents.
now,
to
bring
the
picture
closer
to
hope
as
a
demonstration
of
the
lack
of
this
insatiable
typical
industrial
market,
here's
transcontinental,
it
had
one
large
industrial
customer
for
boiler
fuel,
that
was
the
duke
power
company
in
the
carolinas.
ten
years
ago,
we
were
authorized
to
sell
them
a
substantial
block
of
gas.
they
were
interested
in
the
gas
because
at
that
time
it
was
cheaper
than
coal.
and
then
five
years
ago,
that
project
was
renewed.
it's
running
out
this
december.
duke
power
no
longer
wants
any
gas
from
transcontinental.
why?
the
price
is
too
high.
they
can
buy
coal
cheaper.
they're
taking
a
little
tiny
amount
of
gas
from
us,
for
what
they
call
fuel
ignition
purposes,
but
the
blocks
of
boiler
fuel
gas
are
no
longer
wanted
because
of
the
competitive
price
of
coal.
and
that
situation
is
becoming
more
and
more
acute
and
more
and
more
nationwide
so
this
vast
insatiable
market
spoken
up
in
my
friend's
briefs,
i
think
is
in
the
land
the
imaginary.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
if
we
ourselves
were
--
mr.
richard
j.
connor
yes.
i
am
coming
to
that
point
a
little
later,
if
your
honor
--
mr.
richard
j.
connor
--
please.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
now
next
policy
consideration
was
the
policy
consideration
number
three
to
wit,
the
impact
of
large
demand
or
relatively
limited
supply
is
certain
enough
to
raise
rates
and
prices
in
the
fields,
if
only
one
bidder
is
bringing
that
demand
there.
now
how
much
more
serious
is
that
impact
when
as
the
form
of
multiple
bidders,
each
attempting
to
reserve
to
itself
a
firm
supply.
inevitably,
there
would
be
upward
pressure
on
the
rate
levels
in
the
fields.
we
do
not
believe
we
ought
to
encourage
such
when
it's
unnecessary.
now
what,
in
effect,
is
the
commission
saying?
that
because
con
edison
goes
down
and
buys
non-jurisdictional
gas
that
that
has
a
tendency
to
raise
the
prices
which
go
through
the
fully
resale
regulated
channel
that
the
commission
can
regulate.
but
the
plain
fact
is
that
price
pressure
in
the
field
is
dependent
upon
the
totality
of
the
demand.
in
other
words,
it,
transcontinental
itself,
had
gone
down
and
purchased
this
gas
and
then
sold
it
to
consolidated
edison,
the
end
result,
as
far
as
price
pressure
is
concerned,
would
have
been
absolutely
identical.
but
as
i
will
point
out
so
long
--
mr.
richard
j.
connor
oh,
yes.
we
--
we
could
buy
--
we
could
buy
the
gas.
we
could
buy
gas
and
sell
it
to
consolidated
edison.
however
we'd
again
be
met
with
the
problem
that
we
seem
to
be
run
into
–
run
into
here,
we
don't
know
whether
the
commission
would
let
us
sell
that
chunk
of
gas
to
con
edison
for
boiler
fuels
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
selling
best
amounts
of
sort
of
combination
gas
or
regular
cd
gas,
a
large
part
of
which
goes
under
their
boilers.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
that
is
precisely
the
point,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
real
basic
thrust
of
the
commission's
position,
one
of
the
veneers
stripped
from
the
other
three
or
four
denial
factors,
is
that
here,
the
commission
was
very,
very
reluctant
to
see
any
sale
made
by
a
producer,
which
was
not
subject
to
the
commission's
regulation.
that
i
think
that
the
whole
thrust
of
the
opinion
points
very
strongly
in
that
direction.
i
even
would
venture
the
notion
that
since
they
take
the
view
that
end
use
is
not
determinative,
that
had
we
gone
--
we
transcontinental
bought
the
gas
and
then
resold
it
to
con
ed,
we
probably
wouldn't
be
here
today.
certificate
–
commission
might
well
have
certificated
that.
but
it's
been
mentioned
by
mr.
leboeuf,
this
particular
gas,
transcontinental
didn't
dare
to
buy,
and
why,
because
it
would
have
triggered
transcontinental's
favored
nations
contracts
to
the
extent
that
our
gas
cost
would
have
gone
up
--
the
cost
of
our
other
gas
would
have
gone
up
by
$15,000,000.
and
that's
one
basic
reason
why
transcontinental
was
virtually
shut
out
of
this
field
and
shut
out
from
making
this
purchase.
now,
when
the
commission
talks
about
the
effect
that
this
purchase
being
to
raise
the
price
in
the
jurisdictional
channel,
shall
i
say,
i
think
there's
a
pretty
fair
answer
to
that.
that
congress
has
given
the
commission
machinery
to
regulate
those
prices
in
the
jurisdictional,
purely
jurisdictional
channel,
and
irrespective
of
what
the
influences
are
that
moved
those
prices
up,
the
commission
has
section
4
of
the
act,
section
5
of
the
act,
and
section
7,
in
respect
to
initial
prices.
and
they
have
adequate
machinery
of
control
for
those
prices.
i
will
get
to
cut
some
portions
of
my
discussion
of
each
of
these
policy
considerations,
because
i'd
like
to
spend
a
moment
on
the
so-called
1942
amendment.
the
impression
is
given
throughout
the
briefs
that
the
1942
amendment
of
the
gas
act,
in
some
fashion,
gave
the
commission
authority
over
the
conservation
of
gas.
as
the
lower
court
said
that
--
as
they
read
this
commission's
opinion,
the
commission
was
attempting
herein
to
exercise
that
general
conservation
authority
over
the
totality
of
the
gas
research.
now
what
briefly
was
the
situation?
in
the
original
1938
act,
the
commission
had
an
extremely
straitjacketed,
geographical
jurisdiction.
they
could
only
certificate
another
--
a
pipeline
going
into
the
territory
or
market
already
served.
and
as
commissioner
manley
(ph)
points
out
in
his
testimony,
there
were
tremendous
number
of
difficulties
involved
with
the
administration
of
that.
one,
the
question,
what
was
that
market?
was
it
merely
a
market
served
that
the
actual
towns
it
was
served,
was
it
a
geographical
area,
what
was
it?
he
spells
out
in
detail
what
difficulties
we
had
trying
to
administer
that
section.
so
that
the
basic
fundamental
broad
purpose
of
the
1942
amendment
was
to
release
that
straitjacket
and
give
the
commission
authority
nationwide,
and
that
was
its
one
and
total
purpose.
and
in
the
course
of
his
testimony,
it
was
indicated
that
because
of
the
restricted
nature
of
prior
certificate
authority,
the
coal
people
had
not
been
granted
full
participation
so
that
commissioner
manley
pointed
out
that
a
secondary
effect
of
this
act
would
be
to
permit
the
coal
people
to
be
treated
as
interveners
in
section
7
certificates.
for
what
purpose?
for
the
purpose
of
them
showing
the
economic
effect
upon
them
and
that
is
made
specific
in
the
manley
testimony.
now
the
implication
is
that
there
were
recitals
in
the
hope
case
and
a
recital
in
the
east
ohio
case
that
seemed
to
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
1942
amendment
gave
the
commission
conservation
powers.
i
happen
to
have
here
a
copy
of
the
report
and
i
would
enjoy
having
my
friends,
i
have
two
copies,
pointing
out
anywhere
in
that
report
where
there
is
any
reference
or
suggestion
of
a
conservation
power.
i
don't
happen
to
have
commissioner
manley's
testimony
here,
but
i
have
reviewed
it
and
i
think
that
by
no
stretch
interference,
can
it
possibly
be
said
that
there
was
a
single
word
in
that
1942
testimony
of
his
in
respected
conservation.
and
there
was
a
real
reason
for
it.
when
this
matter
was
being
drafted
in
federal
power
commission,
commissioner
manley
had
one
strong
objective.
he
wanted
to
get
that
legislation
through
rapidly,
and
in
that
interest,
we
brought
into
the
meetings
of
the
federal
power
commission,
the
coal
people,
the
railroad
people,
the
representatives
of
the
pipelines,
and
the
naruc.
to
get
every
last
difficulty
straightened
out
so
that
this
amendment
would
move
through
the
commission
rapidly
or
through
the
congress
rapidly
and
to
have
put
in
any
suggestion
that
we
were
--
wanted
a
power
over
conservation,
would
have
opened
the
pandora's
box
and
that
legislation
might
still
be
pending.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
yes,
but
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
it
does.
but
as
you
pointed
out
and
i'm
sure,
it
was
your
decision
in
the
edison
case
when
you
drew
a
distinction
between
the
broad
type
of
statute
like
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
the
national
racial
--
relations
--
labor
relations
act
and
i
think
the
federal
communications
act.
and
you
said
when
congress
wants
to
give
broad
sweeping
powers,
it
uses
broad
vague
language.
and
the
broader
the
language
and
the
vaguer,
the
more
is
the
power
to
the
administrative
agency
to
fill
in.
and
--
but
you
then
went
on
the
point
the
distinction
in
the
case
of
the
more
restricted
statute,
such
as
the
fair
labor
standards
act
with
which
we
were
dealing.
and
i
think
you
must
remember
that
--
and
you
particularly
pointed
out
the
denials
of
authority
that
were
given
to
the
fair
labor
standards
administrator
and
indicated
that
those
were
restrictions
on
the
concept
of
–
or
the
breadth
of
the
powers.
mr.
richard
j.
connor
yes,
i
find
--
i
find
them
there.
and
in
respect
to
this
notion
of
the
commission
that
they
could
give
to
the
pipeline
companies,
the
net
result
of
the
commission's
decision
is
that
there
is
only
one
group
of
people
that
come
down
into
the
fields
and
buy
gas,
pipelines.
distributing
companies
are
out,
whether
they're
buying
it
for
direct
sales
such
as
this
one
or
whether
they're
buying
it
for
resale.
the
import
of
the
commission's
decision
is
that
they
don't
want
them
down
there
because
they
raise
prices.
i
say
that
they're
answered
thrust
implications
or
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
antitrust
acts
are
being
violated
when
the
commission
restricted
them
to
a
limited
group
of
pipelines,
when
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
federal
trade
commission
in
its
report,
which
is
also
recited,
have
that
as
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
put
section
20
in
the
act.
so
i
think
that
each
section
of
the
act
must
be
read
as
a
limitation
on
the
concept
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
as
it's
contained
in
the
given
statute
and
here
particularly
you
have
1
(b)
which
says
that
they
cannot
regulate
a
direct
sale.
i
think
that's
definitely
to
be
read
into
the
concept
of
public
convenience
and
necessity.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
