ms.
catherine
zorn
mr.
chief
justice.
the
two
questions
here
of
course,
are
the
interpretations
of
article
ii
of
the
treaty
and
the
effect
of
the
international
monetary
fund.
now
the
oregon
supreme
court
in
the
exercise
of
its
de
novo
ennoble
powers
in
equity
reversed
the
trial
court
and
found
on
appeal
that
american
heirs
did
not
in
fact,
have
a
right
to
receive
an
--
an
unqualified
and
legally
enforceable
right
to
receive
payment
of
their
inheritances
from
yugoslavia
by
reason
of
foreign
exchange
control
laws
as
well
other
evidence
in
the
case.
so
that
was
the
factual
question,
but
that
leads
to
two
legal
questions
of
the
treaty
and
the
monetary
fund.
now
the
language
in
the
treaty
of
course,
reads
in
this
manner,
“in
all
their
concerns,
the
right
of
acquiring,
possessing
or
disposing
of
every
kind
of
property,
real
or
personal,
citizens
of
the
united
states,
in
serbia
and
serbian
subjects
in
the
united
states,
shall
enjoy
the
rights
which
respective
laws
grant”.
here
the
language
is
clear
and
plain,
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
serbia
and
serbian
subjects
if
in
the
united
states.
we
submit
that
the
language
of
the
treaty
must
be
read
as
it
appears
in
the
way
in
the
way
it
was
written.
here
it
is
clear
that
the
words,
in
serbia
and
in
the
united
states
modify
the
words,
persons
or
citizens
or
subjects
respectively.
a
similar
language
was
used
in
the
german
treaty
which
was
a
construed
in
clark
versus
allen.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
an
american
citizen
leaving
property
to
a
german
national
did
not
come
within
the
terms
of
the
treaty.
so
here,
an
american
citizen
in
the
united
states
leaving
property
to
foreign
nationals
would
not
be
covered
by
the
yugoslavian
treaty.
in
--
as
a
background
to
this
case,
the
brief
amicus
curiae
as
well
as
the
brief
of
the
petitioners
i
believe,
values
certain
document
from
material,
diplomatic
dispatches
which
were
written
by
casen
and
schiller,
who
were
the
negotiators
of
the
romanian
and
serbian
treaties.
it
corresponds
with
the
secretary
of
state
at
that
time.
i've
not
gone
into
it
too
thoroughly,
that
is
i
had
only
the
copies
of
the
--
the
diplomatic
dispatches
that
were
given
to
me
before
the
state
copies
which
have
been
done
--
filed
down
here
with
the
clerk,
but
to
the
extent
i
did
go
into
them.
it
appears
that
the
language
used
by
the
negotiators
of
the
treaties
schiller
and
casen
is
very
clear.
it's
admirable
for
its
conciseness.
so
it
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
language
in
the
serbian
treaty
was
not
inadvertent
language,
but
language
that
was
carefully
chosen
to
express
a
particular
purpose.
again,
this
document
with
material
points
at
the
background
to
the
situation
at
that
time.
it
had
not
been
too
long
that
serbia
was
free
to
the
turkish
rule.
as
i
understand
it
at
that
time
under
the
treaty's
rule,
capitulations
had
been
granted,
which
gave
foreigners
the
same
rights
within
the
country,
the
serbian
country
as
they
enjoyed
the
home.
and
--
and
again,
i
understand
that
these
capitulations
were
not
very
popular.
again,
it
was
the
united
states
who
was
seeking
the
treaty
with
serbia
rather
than
the
other
converse
situation
that
it's
serbia
seeking
the
treaty
with
the
united
states.
so
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
fear
of
exploitation
and
took
these
steps
to
cut
down
and
qualify
the
rights,
which
they
were
granting
by
this
treaty.
going
on
to
the
international
monetary
fund
which
the
petitioners
have
argued
here
is
an
overriding
federal
policy,
we
find
the
not
too
much
source
of
material
which
throws
light
upon
the
subject.
the
cases
are
very
few.
the
authorities
are
very
few,
which
had
interpreted
the
monetary
fund.
one
of
the
best
sources,
however,
is
the
annual
reports
of
the
board
and
in
them,
it
appears
that
the
policy
of
the
board
is
to
discourage
the
maintenance
of
exchange
restrictions,
rather
than
to
encourage
them.
they
were
the
exchange
restrictions,
many
of
them
were
in
effect
before
the
--
the
world
war
ii
and
they
have
continued
in
effect.
originally
under
monetary
fund
agreement,
they
were
regarded
as
an
emergency
measure
in
the
post
war
period
so
the
countries
would
get
back
on
their
feet.
however,
it
has
been
the
consistent
policy
of
the
fund
to
discourage
foreign
exchange
controls.
as
was
mentioned
here,
inheritances
appeared
to
be
capital
transfers.
the
monetary
fund
agreement
is
concerned
primarily
with
the
current
transactions.
the
fund
report
indicates
that
the
control
of
transfers
--
capital
transfers
are
within
the
control
of
the
member
nations.
so
although
yugoslavia
has
chosen
to
exercise
and
maintain
fund
controls,
the
united
states
has
not
adopted
any
policy
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
or
not,
it
will
have
the
exchange
controls
or
not.
we
have
not
adopted
them.
so
the
--
as
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned,
this
is
a
--
it
has
adopted
no
overriding
federal
policy
which
leaves
the
state
statute
free
to
operate
as
it
was
before
the
united
states
became
a
member
of
the
fund.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
thought
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
believe
the
--
the
agreement
itself
leaves
the
fund
controls
of
capital
transfers
pretty
untouched.
there
are
certain
exceptions
as
for
example,
when
a
member
draws
too
heavily
upon
the
fund
resources,
then
the
fund
can
step
in
and
ask
them
to
put
on
controls.
ms.
catherine
zorn
i
don't
believe
i
quite
follow,
but
my
thought
is
this
--
ms.
catherine
zorn
as
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned,
it
did
not
adopt
any
fund
control
or
any
exchange
restrictions.
ms.
catherine
zorn
the
act
itself
leaves
capital
transfers
pretty
much
untouched.
it
does
leave
the
members
free
to
impose
restrictions
both
on
the
current
transactions
as
well
as
on
capital
transactions,
but
the
united
states
has
not
taken
any
steps
so
far
as
capital
or
--
or
either
transactions
are
concerned,
either
current
or
capital
transactions.
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes.
ms.
catherine
zorn
yes
or
by
the
united
states.
ms.
catherine
zorn
that's
right.
then
it
would
create
an
overriding
policy,
but
so
far
the
united
states
had
done
nothing
either
way
and
therefore
no
policy
has
been
established
in
this
area.
ms.
catherine
zorn
the
annual
reports
to
the
board
indicate
that
capital
movement
is
permitted
to
the
members
of
the
fund
at
all
times.
i
think
that
appears
in
the
1947
annual
report
at
page
33.
"the
fund
reports
on
this
matter,
control
of
capital
movement
is
permitted
to
fund
members
at
all
times."
so,
so
far
as
monetary
fund
is
concerned,
it
does
not
impose
any
overriding
federal
policy.
the
oregon
statute,
ors
111.070
is
the
law
of
succession,
similar
to
the
california
statute
is
what's
considered
in
clark
versus
allen.
it's
a
matter
of
local
determination,
succession
to
estates,
is
not
a
--
also
in
clark
versus
allen,
the
court
pointed
out
it
is
not
an
invasion
into
the
field
of
foreign
affairs.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
--
i
might
add
further
too,
in
regards
to
pecuniary
and
claims
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
yugoslavia
of
1948.
there
it
is
clearly
evident
that
the
yugoslavian
government
does
impose
restrictions
of
foreign
capital
transfers
in
article
viii
and
this
appears
in
the
record
of
page
52.
in
that
article,
the
united
--
the
yugoslavian
government
used
to
give
sympathetic
consideration
to
applications
for
transfers
to
the
united
states.
and
then
goes
on
to
qualify
for
the
amount
just
small
in
the
--
of
importance
to
persons
making
the
request.
so
it
is
reflected
by
this
section
that
foreign
exchange
restrictions
apparently
are
applied,
but
so
far
as
the
united
states
is
concerned,
it
has
adopted
no
overriding
federal
policy
and
therefore,
the
state
statute
prevails.
thank
you.
