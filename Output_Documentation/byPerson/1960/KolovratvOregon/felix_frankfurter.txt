where

where
is
the
exchange
between
yugoslavia
and
the

states
in
the
settlement
in
1948?

what
the

i
understood
from
you,
there
was
an
exchange
whereby
the
1883
was
interpreted
in
the
settlement
made
by

1948

well,

the

were
there
any
preliminary
documents

with
this

justice
felix

but
it
was
--
there
was
--
it
was
in
reference
to
any
particular
litigation
--
justice

all
right,
where
is
that?

what?
justice

justice
felix

right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
must
cover
you
again.
what
is
appendix
b7a,
which
says
explicitly
whether
they
reside
in
yugoslavia
or
elsewhere?
what
is
the
--
what
is
that
document,
does
that
--
define
that
document,
what
is
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
document?
what
is
appendix
b?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
a
note.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
note
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
note
about?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
--
on
the
occasion,
he
didn't
just
a
write
a
note
saying,
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
construe
the
act
of
1880
â€“
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
he
inquire
about?
i
want
to
know
the
occasion
of
this
explicit
statement
by
our
secretary
of
state
that
the
treaty
covers
rights
whether
the
yugoslav
national
resides
physically
in
yugoslavia
or
in
france
or
anywhere
else.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
1958.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
in
connection
with
this
very
suit,
was
it
mr.
lesser?
justice
felix
frankfurter
true.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
curiosity
is
whether
this
pronouncement
by
the
secretary
of
the
state
was
a
post
motam
litem
and
was
directed
to
a
specific
litigation
in
which
he
gave
an
opinion
as
to
what
the
treaty
meant
or
whether
it
was
a
pronouncement,
neutral
as
it
were
so
far
as
a
particular
litigation
was
concerned
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
namely,
that
there
is
an
inquiry
generally
or
whatever
provoked
it,
maybe
in
the
re-consideration
of
a
treaty,
maybe
the
yugoslav
ambassador
wanted
to
know
what
the
state
department
thought
because
if
they
gave
one
answer,
they
might
propose
a
modification
and
if
they
gave
another
answer,
they
would
rest
on
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seemed
like
that
or
in
mind,
mr.
lesser
because
--
we
start
again
with
a
proposition
that
a
settled
construction
by
state
department,
our
treaty
governs
the
courts,
that's
the
general
proposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
later
construction
by
the
secretary
of
state
was
in
confirmation
of
the
attending
circumstances
of
the
original
treaty?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
a
suit.
not
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
means
fully
--
irrespective
of
treaties
or
where
no
treaty
exists,
the
bretton
woods
agreement
was
to
accomplish
the
results
that
you
urge
under
this
article
ii.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that's
(inaudible)
this
--
this
state
of
your
argument
would
undercut
the
great
body
i
should
think
of
state
legislation
regarding
eligibility
by
--
by
foreigners.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
cover
to
you
to
explain
with
some
particularity
whether
the
bretton
woods
act
was
nonoperative
until
there
were
--
there
were
some
implementing
action
by
the
government
either
through
the
congress
or
through
the
executive
department?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
i
gather
from
what
you've
just
said
that
the
bretton
woods
act
as
such,
to
which
the
government
--
the
--
the
united
states
was
a
party,
as
such
did
not
affect
the
free
movement
of
capital,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
if
--
does
the
fund
have
to
do
something
or
derive
by
the
act
and
by
the
treaty
which
then
might
affect
contrary
state
legislations,
is
that
your
view?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that
--
that
the
act
itself,
that
there
was
nothing
done
to
carry
out
the
policy
under
the
act
dealing
with
or
free
capital
movements?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
the
act
itself
did
not
--
did
not
deal
with
the
matter,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
act
was
merely
an
authorizing
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
if
some
step
were
taken
by
the
fund.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
by
the
united
states,
separately.
there
might
--
then
the
problem
might
arise
as
mr.
lesser
the
dealt
with,
is
that
it?
