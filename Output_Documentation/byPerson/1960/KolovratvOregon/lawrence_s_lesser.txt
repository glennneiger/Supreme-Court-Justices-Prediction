mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
it
the
court.
this
matter
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
article
ii
of
an
1881
convention
for
facilitating
and
developing
commercial
relations
between
the
united
states
and
serbia,
which
the
court
below
recognized
as
being
in
effect
between
the
united
states
and
yugoslavia,
the
court
below
declared
a
decree
to
intestate
estates
as
(inaudible)
on
the
ground
that
the
decedents'
next
of
kin,
the
petitioners
here,
being
citizens
and
residents
of
yugoslavia
were
not
entitled
to
inherit
under
section
1
(b)
of
oregon's
reciprocity
statute
so
called,
for
the
reason
that
the
court
found,
and
erroneously
we
would
suggest,
that
remittances
to
the
united
states
of
the
distributive
shares
of
american
beneficiaries
of
yugoslavia
states
was
subject
to
the
foreign
exchange
controls
that
yugoslavia
maintains
under
the
international
monetary
fund
agreement
to
which
the
united
states
and
yugoslavia
and
some
66
other
nations
are
parties.
now,
article
ii
of
the
1881
convention,
reciprocally
grants
to
citizens
of
each
country,
most
favored
nation
rights
to
acquire,
to
possess
and
to
dispose
of
real
and
personal
property,
situated
in
the
other
country
and
specifically
to
acquire
and
dispose
of
such
of
property
whether
by
purchase,
sale,
testament,
inheritance
or
in
any
other
manner
whatever.
now
in
consequence
of
an
1853
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
argentine
and
a
1923
treaty
between
yugoslavia
and
poland,
these
most
favored
nation
rights
have
become
national
rights,
that
is
that
the
citizens
of
each
country
are
entitled
in
these
respects
to
the
rights
of
the
citizens
of
the
other.
now,
the
court
below
recognized
that
if
the
petitioners
were
entitled
to
the
rights
granted
by
article
ii
of
the
convention,
the
oregon
reciprocity
statute
under
which
they
were
held,
disqualified
to
inherit
would
be
inapplicable.
however,
the
court
below
construed
article
ii
of
the
convention
as
granting
rights
only
to
yugoslavs
who
are
within
the
united
states
and
by
necessary
implication
only
to
americans
who
are
in
yugoslavia.
now,
so
far
as
concerns,
the
specific
language
of
the
convention,
we
think
that
the
secretary
of
state
in
construing
this
provision,
put
it
succinctly
when
he
said
that
the
question
is
whether
the
words,
in
serbia
and
in
the
united
states
as
used
in
the
convention,
are
to
be
treated
as
adjectival,
that
is
as
modifying
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
serbian
subjects
respectively
or
whether
they
are
to
be
treated
as
advertent,
that
is
as
modifying
(inaudible).
now
on
the
face
of
it,
the
language
of
the
convention
is
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
that's
article
ii,
your
honor.
now
on
the
face
it,
the
language
of
the
convention
is
susceptible
to
the
interpretation
that
the
court
below
put
upon
it,
but
only
on
the
face
of
it
and
only
if
the
convention's
express
purpose
of
facilitating
and
developing
commercial
relations
between
the
two
countries
is
completely
disregarded.
the
inescapable
consequence
of
the
interpretation
of
the
court
below
would
be
to
defeat
every
objective
of
the
treaty,
necessary
to
the
achievement
of
its
ultimate
purpose
and
to
defeat
that
purpose
itself.
for
example,
under
the
construction
of
the
court
below,
if
a
merchant
in
one
country
wanted
to
buy
or
sell
goods
in
the
other,
he
would
have
no
treaty
right
to
acquire,
to
possess
or
to
dispose
of
such
goods
or
indeed
of
the
money
and
credits
that
would
be
involved
in
such
a
sale.
nor
if
such
a
merchant
engaged
in
a
transaction
of
that
kind,
would
he
have
any
treaty
guarantee
that
in
the
event
of
his
death,
the
funds
and
credits
and
goods
that
he
accumulated
in
the
other
country,
would
descend
to
his
next
of
kin,
who
remained
at
home.
furthermore,
merchants
in
one
country
would
have
no
treaty
right
to
the
--
to
access
to
the
courts
of
the
other,
in
the
event
of
dispute,
nor
would
there
be
any
treaty
protection,
whatsoever,
against
discriminatory
practices
in
relation
to
the
taxation,
customs
or
any
other
of
the
multitude
of
matters
affecting
trade
and
commerce
and
with
respect
to
which
the
convention
purports
to
think.
and
what's
more,
the
goods
and
credits
of
the
merchants
of
one
country
that
were
in
the
other
would
not
be
exempted
from
forced
loans
or
military
exactions
or
requisitions
as
the
convention
provides.
now,
when
--
bear
in
mind
that
commerce
between
countries
is
and
has
been
typically
conducted
by
merchants
(inaudible),
who
stay
at
home
themselves
and
do
business
abroad
by
mail
and
cable
or
by
traveling
salesmen
or
traveling
buyers.
the
construction
of
the
court
below
would
leave
the
convention
a
slim
read,
if
read
at
all,
for
facilitating
the
--
and
developing
commercial
relations
between
the
two
countries,
but
the
court
below
took
no
such
considerations
into
account
and
it
expressly
refused
to
give
any
weight
whatsoever,
to
the
secretary
of
state's
carefully
considered
construction
of
the
convention
communicated
to
and
concurred
in
by
yugoslavia
that
article
ii
grants
to
the
citizens
of
each
of
country
whatever
they
might
be,
the
right
to
acquire
by
inheritance
or
otherwise,
property
located
in
the
other
and
the
right
freely
to
possess
and
dispose
of
property
located
in
the
other.
nor
did
the
court
below
give
any
weight
whatsoever
to
what
we
consider
the
most
compelling
circumstance
that
the
united
states
had
fully
relied
on
the
convention
so
construed
to
protect
all
american
property
rights
in
yugoslavia
when
it
negotiated
and
concluded
the
yugoslav
claims
settlement
agreement
in
1948,
that
yugoslavia
had
acquiesced
in
that
construction
and
that
the
construction
adopted
by
the
court
below
would
necessarily
result
in
american
property
and
american
property
rights
in
yugoslavia
being
wholly
without
treaty
protection
except
for
such
property
and
property
rights
as
belonging
to
the
few
americans
that
can
be
found
in
yugoslavia.

mr.

the

about

of
the

convention.
mr.

no,
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
no,
the
--
the
yugoslav
ambassador
inquired
and
the
inquiry
is
set
out
on
page
12a.
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
well,
the
precise
--
the
precise
occasion
was
the
inquiry
by
the
yugoslav
ambassador
as
to
what
the
view
of
the
united
states
was
in
that
regard
with
respect
to
article
ii
of
the
convention.
the
yugoslav
ambassador
pointed
out
that
some
questions
had
been
raised
in
--
in
various
times
and
in
various
places
as
to
the
meaning
of
it.
he
pointed
out
also
that
in
negotiating
the
1948
claims
settlement
agreement.
it
was
understood
by
both
parties
that
this
worked
both
ways
and
so
forth
and
so
on
and
that
was
it.
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
1958,
sir.
and
the
claim
certainly
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
i
wouldn't
say
in
connection
with
this
suit,
but
i
must
say
that
from
what
i
understand
there's
been
a
great
deal
of
litigation
involving
yugoslav
inheritances.
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
in
some
of
the
cases,
the
treaty
wasn't
involved
at
all,
in
others,
it
has
been.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
but
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
i
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
construction
by
the
state
department
here
is
one
that
was
demonstrably
that
of
the
negotiator
in
1881.
it
was
that
that
was
adopted
in
1948
not
only
by
the
state
department,
but
by
the
house
foreign
affairs
committee
and
senate
foreign
relations
committee,
the
one
they
reported
favorably.
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
yes,
sir.
and
the
occasion
for
the
yugoslav
ambassador's
inquiry
was
in
fact,
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
about
this
in
connection
with
a
series
of
litigations.
not
--
not
this
particular
--
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
not
this,
oh
on.
now,
there
have
been
--
there
have
been
others.
now
the
court
below
construed
article
ii
as
it
did
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
case
was
doubled,
the
first
case
was
doubled.
the
first
construction
was
doubled
by
this
court's
decision,
in
clark
against
allen,
331
u.s.
503
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
completely
misread
both
clark
and
the
treaty
provisions
there
involved.
in
clark,
an
american
had
bequeathed
property
located
in
the
united
states
to
a
german
and
the
question
was
what?
the
1923
treaty
with
germany
protected
the
legatee
against
the
consequences
of
california's
so
called
reciprocity
statute.
the
german
treaty
provided
nationals
of
either
high
contracting
party,
may
have
full
power
to
dispose
of
their
personal
property
of
every
kind
within
the
territories
of
the
other.
and
their
heirs,
legatees
and
donees
of
whatever
nationality
whether
resident
or
non-resident,
shall
succeed
to
such
personal
property.
now
following
the
line
of
cases,
beginning
with
the
1860
decision
in
frederickson
against
louisiana,
which
dealt
with
the
series
of
treaties
having
almost
identical
language
with
that
of
the
german
treaty,
this
court
held
in
clark
that
the
--
that
either
high
contracting
party
met
one
high
contracting
party
and
that
the
phrase,
“within
the
territories
of
the
other,”
modifies
their
personal
property
so
that
the
--
such
personal
property
which
could
be
inherited
was
the
personal
property
within
the
territory
of
one
country
belonging
to
a
citizen
of
the
other.
accordingly,
this
point
held
clark
that
the
german
treaty
did
not
apply,
because
that
was
not
a
case
where
a
citizen
of
one
country
had
bequeathed
property
located
in
the
other,
but
was
a
case
where
a
citizen
of
one
country
had
bequeathed
property
located
in
his
own.
now
the
difference
between
the
german
treaty
and
article
ii
of
the
convention
is
clear.
under
the
german
treaty,
the
right
of
a
legatee
or
other
beneficiary
to
succeed
depends
upon
the
decedent
being
a
citizen
of
one
country.
and
the
subject
of
the
gift
being
property
located
in
the
other,
the
german
treaty
expressly
provides
that
the
nationality
and
the
residence
of
the
legatee
is
immaterial.
now
article
ii
of
the
convention
however,
covers
both
disposition
and
acquisition
by
any
means
whatsoever,
of
property
in
one
country
by
citizens
of
the
other,
wholly
without
reference
in
the
--
to
a
--
wholly
without
reference
to
the
nationality
or
residence
of
the
donee.
in
the
case
of
disposition
or
the
nationality
or
residence
of
the
donor
in
the
case
of
acquisition,
the
only
question
being
whether
this
right
of
citizens
of
one
country
to
acquire
property
located
in
the
other
by
inheritance
or
otherwise
and
to
possess
and
to
dispose
of
property
located
in
the
other
is
limited
to
such
of
those
citizens
who
themselves
are
within
the
territory
of
the
other
country
within
which
the
property
is
located.
now,
the
court
below
read
the
german
treaty
as
though
the
phrase,
“within
the
territories
of
the
other”
modified
nationals
of
either
high
contracting
party
rather
than
the
phrase,
“their
personal
property
of
every
kind”
which
is
what
this
court
held.
and
it
misunderstood
clark
as
holding
and
i
quote,
"that
the
german
treaty
applied
only
to
nationals
of
either
of
the
party
nations
who
were
within
the
territory
of
the
other."
now
--
no
such
question
arose
in
clark,
no
point
had
arisen
in
clark
because
the
german
treaty
specifically
support
that
a
donee's
right
to
succeed
is
out
--
is
without
regard
to
his
nationality
or
residence.
now,
the
decision
in
clark
did
not
hinge
on
the
whereabouts
of
either
the
testator
or
the
legatee,
but
rather
on
the
nationality
of
the
testator
and
the
location
of
the
property
which
was
the
subject
of
the
gift.
under
the
german
treaty,
it
was
decisive
that
the
decedent
was
an
american
and
that
the
property
was
in
the
united
states
since
the
right
of
a
donee
to
take
ownership
depends
upon
the
donor,
being
a
citizen
of
one
country,
and
the
property
being
located
in
the
other.
now
here,
that
the
decedent
was
an
american
and
that
the
property
is
in
the
united
states
is
wholly
immaterial
because
under
the
convention,
the
right
of
a
donee
to
take
depends
upon
his
--
the
donee's,
being
a
citizen
of
one
country
and
the
property
being
within
the
other.
we
think
it's
clear
that
clark
is
without
relevance
here,
either
as
a
precedent
or
by
way
of
analogy
and
that
the
court
below
was
completely
mistaken
in
relying
upon
it.
we
believe
also
that
the
construction
of
the
court
below
must
be
rejected
as
entirely
incompatible
and
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
convention
and
one
which
would
make
it
wholly
ineffective.
we
think
that
the
construction
placed
on
the
convention
by
the
executive,
that's
the
secretary
of
state,
the
negotiator
and
by
the
congressional
committees
is
entitled
to
exceptionally
great
weight
here,
particularly
since
it
was
relied
on
in
negotiating
and
implementing
the
agreement
for
the
protection
of
american
property
rights
in
yugoslavia
and
yugoslavia
acquiesced
in
it.
now
the
convention
is
a
two-way
street
and
if
the
right
of
these
petitioners
to
inherit
this
american
property
is
not
protected
by
it,
then
neither
is
any
property
right
or
any
property
in
yugoslavia
of
any
american
other
than
such
americans
as
native
in
yugoslavia.
we
think
that
the
construction
placed
on
article
ii
by
the
court
below
is
without
authority
in
clark
or
elsewhere
and
is
contrary
to
the
basic
tenets
for
the
construction
of
treaties
announced
time
and
time
again
by
this
court.
we
think
that
the
construction
for
which
we
argue
the
construction
of
the
secretary
of
state
and
of
the
congressional
committees,
does
make
the
standards,
does
give
effect
to
the
treaty
and
is
the
only
proper
construction
of
the
convention
and
that
for
that
reason
the
decrees
below
should
be
reversed.
now
alternatively,
the
petitioners
believe
that
the
decrees
below
should
be
reversed
because
section
1
(b)
of
the
oregon
reciprocity
statute
so
called,
as
construed
by
the
court
below
and
applied
by
it
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
articles
of
agreement
of
the
international
monetary
fund
to
which
the
united
states
and
some
66
other
nations
are
parties.
article
vi,
section
3
of
the
agreement
to
which
the
united
states
became
a
party
pursuant
to
the
bretton
woods
agreement
act,
provides
and
i
quote,
“members
may
exercise
such
controls
as
are
necessary
to
regulate
international
capital
movement.
transfers
of
legacies
from
one
country
to
another,
as
oregon
admits,
are
international
capital
movement.”
accordingly,
even
if
yugoslavia
subjects
remittances
of
legacies
abroad
to
its
foreign
exchange
controls,
which
we
suggest
is
not
the
case,
but
if
it
does,
it
does
so
as
a
matter
of
right
under
the
fund
agreement
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party.
and
we
think
it's
clear
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
a
state
may
not
pursue
a
domestic
policy
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
policy
and
action
within
the
competence
of
the
federal
government
to
take.
and
by
the
fund
agreement,
the
united
states
has
agreed
to
the
maintenance
by
yugoslavia
and
the
other
fund
members
of
controls
on
capital
transfers
abroad.
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
with
respect
--
with
respect
to
this
particular
case
and
this
is
the
holding
of
the
court
below
under
section
1
(b),
yes,
sir.
oregon
says
that
citizens
of
any
country
which
exercises
that
right,
that
right
given
to
them
by
the
fund
agreement,
will
be
denied
right
of
inheritances
--
inheritance
that
they
would
otherwise
enjoy.
now,
oregon
would
thus
put
an
onerous
penalty
on
the
exercise
by
a
foreign
government
of
a
right
which
the
united
states
has
agreed
it
may
exercise.
if
oregon
can
do
that,
then
each
of
the
50
states
can
take
measures
within
the
ambit
of
its
domestic
policy
which
would
penalize
or
encumber
the
exercise
by
a
foreign
government
of
any
right
recognized
or
granted
by
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
it
might
get
involved
sir.
i
think
that
in
our
petition,
we
pointed
that
out.
that
there
is
a
great
body
of
state
legislation
which
says
that
if
the
--
a
foreign
government
does
--
thus
and
so
exchange
--
under
exchange
controls,
certain
consequences
follow.
now,
a
number
of
those
foreign
governments
are
members
of
fund
and
parties
of
the
agreement,
but
a
number
are
not.
now,
we
think
that
it's
perfectly
clear
though
that
a
state
should
not
be
permitted
to
say
to
a
foreign
government
if
you
exercise
the
right
which
the
united
states
has
agreed
to,
we're
going
to
penalize
you
by
depriving
your
citizens
of
rights
under
our
laws
to
which
they
otherwise
be
entitled.
we
think
that
for
that
reason,
that
the
decrees
below
should
be
reversed,
also.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
may
i
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
question
mr.
justice
frankfurter
put?
mr.
lawrence
s.
lesser
the
united
states
became
a
party
to
the
international
monetary
fund
agreement
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
to
the
executive
by
the
congress
in
the
bretton
woods
agreement
act.
at
that
time,
the
international
monetary
fund
agreement
had
already
been
drafted
and
it
was
the
subject
of
hearing
it
before
the
congress,
before
they
passed
the
enabling
statute.
at
the
time
they
passed
the
enabling
statute
when
the
united
states
signed
it
and
at
the
present
day,
the
fund
agreement
provided
as
follows,
“members
may
exercise
such
controls
as
are
necessary
to
regulate
international
capital
movements.”
