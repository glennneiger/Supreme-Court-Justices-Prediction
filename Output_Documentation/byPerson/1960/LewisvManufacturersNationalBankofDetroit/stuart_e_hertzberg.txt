mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
arises
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
the
crucial
issue
involving
this
matter
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
so-called
"strong-arm
clause",
thus
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
for
the
rights
of
a
lien
creditor
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy
whether
or
not
such
a
creditor
actually
exist.
the
trustee
in
the
case
at
bar
attempted
to
invalidate
a
michigan
chattel
mortgage
which
had
been
belatedly
recorded
but
recorded
prior
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
there
was
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
simple
contract
creditor
who
had
extended
credit
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
recording
of
this
mortgage.
this
was
the
type
of
creditor
who
was
protected
under
michigan
law.
the
referee
in
bankruptcy
invalidated
this
mortgage
under
section
70c
and
was
reversed
by
the
district
court
which
was
then
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
now
famous
case
of
constance
versus
harvey
with
a
similar
set
of
facts
arrived
in
a
directly
contrary
conclusion.
in
that
case,
they
had
involved
a
new
york
chattel
mortgage
--
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
a
sua
sponte
opinion,
your
honor
--
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
--
took
a
different
position.
thank
you.
i
arrived
at
a
different
conclusion
in
a
sua
sponte
opinion.
in
that
case,
a
new
york
chattel
mortgage
had
been
recorded
prior
to
bankruptcy
but
not
within
a
reasonable
time
as
required
under
new
york
law.
again,
there
was
no
proof
of
the
existence
of
a
simple
contract
creditor
who
extended
credit
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
the
recording
of
this
mortgage.
this
was
the
type
of
creditor
who
was
protected
under
new
york
law.
the
referee
in
the
district
court
took
the
position,
that
even
though
there
was
no
actual
creditor
who
could
have
invalidated
this
mortgage
without
the
intervention
of
bankruptcy,
that
the
trustee
was
a
lien
creditor
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy
and
that
necessarily
included
within
these
rights
were
the
rights
of
a
lessor
creditor,
namely
an
interim
creditor
under
new
york
law
and
invalidated
this
mortgage.
the
second
circuit,
in
a
sua
sponte
opinion,
affirmed
the
position
of
the
district
court.
we
feel
that
the
decision
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
arrived
at
the
correct
conclusion
and
we
are
seeking
an
affirmation
by
this
court
of
the
decision
in
constance
versus
harvey.
now,
the
trustee's
rights
under
the
bankruptcy
act
are
not
derivative.
he
is
an
independent
creature
whose
rights
arise,
rights
and
powers
arise
by
act
of
congress.
and
there
are
many
instances
where
his
rights
and
powers
are
in
excess
of
the
actual
rights
and
powers
of
a
natural
creditor
under
state
law.
and
we
feel
that
constance
versus
harvey
is
just
another
instance
where
you
find
the
rights
of
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
by
reference
to
the
language
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
not
by
reference
to
the
rights
of
any
actual
questionable
creditor
under
state
law.
there
are
many
other
examples
in
the
bankruptcy
act
where
these
rights
are
in
excessive
creditor's
rights
under
state
law.
section
60
allows
the
trustee
to
invalidate
preference
obtained
within
four
months
of
bankruptcy.
many
states
including
michigan
do
not
give
creditors
this
right
under
any
consideration.section
67a
(1)
allows
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
invalidate
judicial
liens
obtained
within
four
months
of
bankruptcy
where
there
is
insolvency.
we
are
not
aware
of
any
state
in
the
union
which
allows
creditors
to
accomplish
this
fact.
and
finally,
we
come
to
section
70e
of
the
bankruptcy
act
which
is
that
section
where
the
trustee's
rights
in
fact
are
derivative.
the
trustee
under
section
70e
has
placed
in
the
shoes
of
an
actual
flesh
and
blood
creditor
under
the
various
state
registration
laws,
under
the
famous
case
of
moore
versus
bay
which
was
decided
by
the
united
states
supreme
court
in
1931.
the
decision
in
that
case
was
rendered
by
justice
holmes.
the
supreme
court
allowed
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
invalidate
a
california
chattel
mortgage
for
the
benefit
of
all
creditors
of
the
state
even
though
without
the
intervention
of
bankruptcy,
this
creditor
could
only
have
invalidated
the
mortgage
to
the
extent
of
his
own
obligation.
therefore,
in
essence,
a
$10
mortgage
--
a
$10
obligation
could
invalidate
a
million
dollar
mortgage.
this
decision
was
criticized
as
unsound,
inequitable
and
erroneous.
yet
in
1938,
congress
codified
this
particular
section
in
section
70e
(2),
so
that
where
in
actual
creditor
under
state
law
could
only
invalidate
the
mortgage
the
extent
of
his
obligation,
the
supreme
court
held
that
the
trustee
had
rights
which
were
in
excessively
creditor
under
state
law
and
it
could
have
validated
in
toto.
now,
the
respondent's
charge
at
the
second
circuit
in
constance
versus
harvey,
wrenched
the
word,
and
i
quote,
"could
have
obtained
a
lien
out
of
the
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
gave
them
an
affect
which
was
contrary
to
its
true
meaning
and
the
legislative
intent."
and
we
say
this
just
isn't
so.
constance
versus
harvey
or
the
doctrine
said
forth
therein
was
the
law
prior
to
this
decision
in
1954
and
was
the
law
prior
to
the
amendment
to
the
bankruptcy
act
in
1952
which
inserted
the
words
"could
have
obtained
a
lien".
the
predecessor
to
section
70c
was
section
47a
(2)
which
was
passed
in
1910
and
which
vested
the
trustee
with
the
rights
of
a
lien
creditor
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
it
did
not
use
the
words
"whether
or
not
such
a
creditor
actually
exist".
and
one
of
the
first
cases,
decided
under
this
law
with
in
re
calhoun
which
was
a
district
court
case
of
alabama
in
1911.
in
that
case,
we
have
an
unrecorded
conditional
sales
contract.
alabama
law
protected
a
creditor
who
extended
credit
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
recording
of
a
conditional
sales
contract.
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
such
a
creditor.
and
the
court
held
that
since
section
47a
(2),
that's
the
trustee
where
the
rights
of
a
lien
creditor
that
necessarily
included
within
these
rights
where
the
rights
of
the
most
favored
class
of
creditors
under
state
law
and
under
alabama
law,
this
was
a
creditor
who
would
obtain
a
judgement
between
execution
and
recording.
and
on
page
16
of
our
brief,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
two
very
vital
paragraphs
in
this
opinion.
"the
purpose
of
congress,"
and
i'm
quoting,
"was
to
embrace
within
these
words
every
class
of
creditors
with
liens
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings
favored
by
the
bearing
registration
laws
of
each
of
the
state.
the
registration
laws
of
some
of
the
states
include
but
one
of
many
classes
of
such
creditors.
in
that
case,
the
purpose
of
congress
is
not
to
be
frustrated
as
to
the
included
class
because
other
classes
included
within
the
amendment
were
not
included
also
in
the
registration
act
of
that
particular
state."
and
in
the
third
paragraph
which
is
very
vital,
"the
test
is
whether
there
exist
a
class
properly
within
the
language
of
the
amendment
and
that
of
the
alabama
registration
act.
it
is
conceded
that
a
judgement
creditor
holding
a
lien
by
execution
is
such
a
class.
the
trustee,
therefore,
is
vested
with
the
right
by
the
amendment
and
the
registration
act
of
that
class
to
avoid
unrecorded
conditional
sales
contracts."
and
this
had
to
be
their
position
because
in
the
50
states,
you
have
50
bearing
registration
laws.
some
protect
creditors
who
extend
credit
in
the
interim
between
executions
and
recordings.
some
protect
judgment
creditors.
some
protect
lien
creditors.
some
of
the
statutes
require
immediate
recording,
others
allow
reasonable
time
to
record.
and
as
a
result,
the
bankruptcy
act
has
to
be
applied
uniformly.
and
this
court
held,
in
effect,
that
if
there
is
a
class
of
protected
creditors
under
the
state
registration
act,
then
the
trustee
is
a
member
of
the
most
favored
class
plus
a
lien
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
further
evidence
of
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
constance
verus
harvey
prior
to
this
decision
were
two
very
interesting
cases
which
arose
out
of
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
respectively.
one
was
in
re
urban
which
involve
a
michigan
chattel
mortgage
and
the
other
was
mckay
versus
trusco
finance
company
of
montgomery,
alabama
which
involved
an
alabama
chattel
mortgage.
in
both
cases,
the
chattel
mortgage
was
not
recorded
prior
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.both
states
protect
an
interim
creditor
who
extends
credit
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
the
recording
of
the
chattel
mortgage.
it's
important
to
know
that
in
both
of
these
cases,
there
was
no
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
simple
contract
creditor
who
extend
a
credit
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
recording.
this
being
the
type
of
creditor
protected.
and
as
a
result,
the
trustee
could
not
use
section
70e.
in
both
cases,
the
courts
allowed
the
trustee
to
invalidate
these
mortgages
under
section
70c
and
it's
important
to
note
that
if
a
lien
was
obtained
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
recording
of
these
mortgages,
that
these
particular
instruments
could
not
have
been
invalidated.
so
the
court
held
in
effect
that
the
trustee
is
a
lien
creditor
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
and
the
urban
case
used
this
language.
and
that
necessarily
included
within
his
status
of
a
lien
creditor
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy
is
the
status
of
a
lessor
creditor
who
was
a
member
of
the
most
favored
class
under
state
law.
now,
the
critiques
of
constance
versus
harvey
claim
that
if
the
interpretation
of
the
second
circuit
of
section
70c
is
correct,
then
it
makes
section
70e
superposed
and
then
why
didn't
congress
just
repeal
this
section?
and
again,
we
say
this
just
isn't
so.
the
states
have
divided
into
two
main
groups
as
to
the
class
of
protect
--
creditors
who
are
protected
under
the
state
registration
laws.
the
minority
group
of
states
which
include
the
big
commercial
states
of
new
york,
california,
illinois,
michigan
state
that
a
simple
contract
creditor
who
extends
credit
between
execution
and
recording
is
the
protected
class
of
creditors
under
their
state
laws,
thus,
if
a
lien
is
obtained
between
execution
and
recording,
it
does
not
protect
the
creditor
in
those
states.
in
the
majority
of
the
states
including
those
who
follow
the
uniform
commercial
code,
a
creditor
who
fastens
a
lien
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
the
recording
of
the
mortgage
is
the
type
of
creditor
who
is
protected
under
their
registration
act
regardless
of
when
credit
is
extended.
now,
let's
apply
constance
versus
harvey
to
these
two
separate
sets
of
groups
of
states.
if
the
chattel
mortgage,
if
the
chattel
mortgage
is
not
recorded
prior
to
bankruptcy,
then
both
groups
of
states
have
held
that
the
trustee
may
use
the
section
70c
to
invalidate
this
chattel
mortgages
and
respondents
admit
this
in
their
brief.
now,
the
trustee
is
a
lien
creditor
to
hold
this
in
both
group
of
states
especially
in
the
interim
contract
creditor
state,
you
would
have
to
say
that
included
within
his
status
of
a
lien
creditor
is
a
simple
contract
creditor.
if
the
chattel
mortgage
was
recorded
prior
to
bankruptcy,
then
constance
versus
harvey
recognizes
this
distinction.
in
those
states
that
only
require
a
simple
contract
creditor
who
extends
credit
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
recording,
the
trustee
could
use
section
70c
to
invalidate
these
chattel
mortgages.
in
those
states
which
require
a
lien
creditor
who
is
--
who
must
fasten
a
lien
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
recording,
constance
versus
harvey
in
it's
interpretation,
could
not
possibly
apply
because
this
distinction
is
recognized
by
that
decision,
that
the
lien
is
a
lien
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy
and
does
not
relate
back
as
charged
by
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
by
the
respondents.
this
lien
does
not
relate
back.
and
as
a
result
in
those
states,
unless
you
could
find
an
actual
flesh
and
blood
creditor
under
section
70e
of
the
act,
the
trustee
could
not
invalidate
a
chattel
mortgage.
now,
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
respondents
fail
to
--
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
pardon?
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
that
is
right,
justice
stewart.
new
york,
michigan,
california,
illinois
and
some
of
the
other
important
commercial
states
belong
to
this
particular
category.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
that's
right.
they
do
diverge
however
from
this
stand
point.
new
york
provides
for
a
reasonable
time
to
record
their
chattel
mortgages.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
that's
right,
immediately.
however,
they
have
now
amended
their
act
to
provide
for
a
10-day
period
of
registration,
so
they
diverge
there.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
now,
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
respondents
failed
to
see
this
particular
distinction
that
i
have
pointed
out
in
constance
versus
harvey
because
the
sixth
circuit
cited
holt
versus
crucible
steel
which
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
in
re
american
textile
printers
society
as
refusing
to
follow
constance
versus
harvey.
and
the
respondents
in
their
brief
state
that
in
re
american
textile
printers,
which
is
a
district
court
case
from
new
jersey,
was
an
evasion
of
constance
versus
harvey.
and
then
they
say
--
they
cite
bailey
versus
baker
ice
machine
company,
which
was
decided
by
this
supreme
court
in
1915,
as
further
evidence
of
a
rejection
of
the
interpretation
of
section
70c.
in
all
three
cases,
it
involved
the
conditional
sales
contract
in
all
three
states,
the
type
of
creditors
protected
were
lien
creditors
who
fasten
their
liens
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
recording
of
these
conditional
sales
instruments.
all
of
them
have
been
recorded
prior
to
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
and
as
a
result,
the
decision
was
proper.
they
recognized
the
distinction
and
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
interpretation
in
constance
versus
harvey.
now,
the
reception
of
constance
verus
harvey
has
been
buried.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
considered
this
decision
again
in
conti
against
volper.
and
with
an
entirely
different
panel
sitting
on
this
particular
case,
they
stated,
"it's
difficult
to
see
how
such
plain
language
could
be
disregarded."
and
this
was
a
case
where
both
sides
have
written
briefs
in
opposition
to
the
interpretation
of
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
then
the
losing
lawyer
in
conti
versus
volper,
then
it
is
frustration
on
the
legal
profession
and
he
wrote
a
legal
article
for
the
fordham
law
review
and
is
now
cited
as
an
authority
in
the
brief
of
the
respondents.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
in
miller
versus
sellmeyer
(ph)
have
indicated
emphatically
that
they
will
follow
constance
versus
harvey,
that
this
circuit
with
two
different
panels
have
indicated
that
they're
going
both
ways.
brookhaven
bank
&
trust
company
versus
gwin
indicated
that
it
would
follow
constance
versus
harvey
and
a
different
panel
in
blackford
versus
commercial
credit
company
have
said
to
the
contrary.
there
are
only
two
courts
who
have
actually
ruled
in
opposition
of
constance
versus
harvey.
one
is
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
other
is
in
re
billings
which
is
a
case
arising
out
of
the
district
court
of
missouri
plus
a
case
which
--
which
has
just
come
down
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
michigan.
in
conclusion,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
construction
of
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
a
correct
conclusion
that
the
trustee
is
a
lien
creditor
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy
and
that
necessarily
included
within
his
status
is
the
rights
and
powers
of
the
most
favored
class
of
creditors
under
state
law.
in
new
york,
in
michigan,
it
was
a
simple
contract
creditor
who
extended
credit
between
the
date
of
execution
and
the
date
of
the
recording
of
the
mortgage.
if
the
results
of
this
construction
are
harsh,
as
respondent
has
stated
in
their
brief,
then
it
is
up
to
congress
to
amend
the
bankruptcy
act
to
change
the
situation
or
the
various
states
to
correct
their
state
registration
laws
because
the
bankruptcy
act
must
be
applied
uniformly
and
michigan
has
amended
their
registration
act
now
on
three
occasions
since
the
decision
in
constance
versus
harvey.
and
they
finally
now
provide
that
you
shall
have
a
10-day
period
to
record.
and
as
respondents
said
in
their
brief,
an
opposition
to
our
writ
of
certiorari,
a
reasonably
diligent
chattel
mortgagee
can
now
protect
themselves
in
spite
of
constance
versus
harvey
in
new
york,
michigan,
california,
illinois,
missouri
and
the
other
minority
states.
we,
therefore,
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
be
reversed
and
that
the
chattel
mortgage
involved
in
this
case
be
set
aside
under
section
70c
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
i
have
no
rebuttal
before
(inaudible).
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
certainly,
if
--
if
the
court
please,
certainly,
the
time
limitation
would
be
the
individual
statute
of
limitations
of
the
various
states.
and
added
to
this
is
this
factor
that
chattel
mortgages
and
conditional
sales
contracts
are
short
term
securities.
so
as
a
practical
matter,
they
would
be
governed
by
the
duration
of
the
security
device
itself.
and
i
--
i
don't
know
if
that
thoroughly
answers
the
question
but
i
would
say
we
clearly
be
covered
by,
i
think,
the
statute
of
limitations
of
the
state.
also,
as
to
bulk
sales
contracts
and
bulk
mortgages,
the
difference
between
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
here
today
and
respondents
have
cited
and
the
bulk
sales
cases
are
that
if
you
properly
complied
with
the
bulk
sales
act
by
giving
notice
to
all
creditors,
there
has
been
a
compliance
with
the
act
which
is
all
that
is
required
under
the
act.
whereas,
in
every
one
of
this
chattel
mortgage
and
conditional
sales
contracts
situations
that
we
have
cited,
there
has
been
a
failure
in
some
way
to
comply
with
the
act.
and
i
think
that's
a
definite
distinction
between
the
two
types
of
cases
in
constance
versus
harvey
could
not
possibly
apply
to
a
bulk
sales
or
a
bulk
mortgage
situation
where
a
list
of
creditors
has
been
presented
to
a
purchaser
and
notices
has
been
properly
sent
out
in
compliance
with
the
act.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
well,
my
comment
is
this,
justice
frankfurter.
they
criticized
moore
versus
bay
as
being
inequitable
and
erroneous.
tremendous
criticism
followed
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
in
corn
exchange
versus
klauder
where
they
said
that
this
decision
wouldn't
destroy
the
entire
non-notification
accounts
receivable
financing
in
this
country.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
no,
i'm
--
i'm
saying
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
pardon?
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
at
the
time
of
the
various
decisions
--
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
--
these
charges
were
made.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
in
moore
versus
bay,
legislation
was
not
passed
until
eight
years
after
the
decision.
in
corn
exchange
versus
klauder,
in
spite
of
the
criticism,
the
supreme
court
ruled
that
this
was
a
clear
construction
of
section
60
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
it
would
be
up
to
congress
to
amend
section
60
which
congress
then
did
immediately
following
the
decision
in
corn
exchange
versus
klauder.
and
i
say
this,
that
the
decision
in
constance
versus
harvey
is
not
dependent
upon
the
1952
amendment
because
constance
versus
harvey
has
been
the
law
since
1910.
and
therefore,
congressional
intent
in
1959
and
congressional
intent
in
1952
certainly
cannot
apply
as
to
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
1910
and
the
1938
at
the
time
of
the
amendment
of
the
chandler
act.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
that
is
correct.
after
six
years
following
the
constance
case.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
then
it
is
--
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
my
personal
opinion,
justice
frankfurter,
would
be
the
court
should
take
the
same
position
that
it
took
in
corn
exchange
versus
klauder
where
it
was
anticipated
that
the
registration
acts
or
congress
was
going
to
immediately
amend
after
the
results
of
that
decision
anyway.
this
is
a
judicial
construction
of
a
section
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
and
as
a
result,
if
congress
sees
fit
at
a
future
date
to
amend
this
particular
section
after
the
results
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court,
then
that
is
for
congress
of
that
particular
period
of
time.
but
i
don't
think
it
should
affect
a
judicial
construction
of
a
section
of
the
act.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
e.
hertzberg
no,
your
honor.
but
i
say
it's
clearly
a
construction
for
the
supreme
court
if
congress
wants
to
amend
the
act
later.
that
is
the
prerogative
of
the
congress.
thank
you.
