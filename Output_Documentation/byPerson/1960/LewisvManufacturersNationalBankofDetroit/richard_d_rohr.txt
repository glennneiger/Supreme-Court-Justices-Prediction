mr.
richard
d.
rohr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
my
friend
and
office
neighbor
in
detroit
has
well
stated
the
facts
in
the
case
before
us.
there
has
never
been
a
dispute
as
to
this.
as
he
has
indicated
a
narrow
legal
issue
confronts
us
here,
namely
two
interpretations
of
section
70c.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
at
the
outset
to
attempt
to
refine
this
issue
a
bit
by
saying
that
the
interpretation,
which
i
urge
upon
this
court
and
the
interpretation
adopted
by
the
sixth
circuit,
is
simply
this,
in
determining
a
trustee's
status
potency
rights
as
a
lien
creditor
under
section
70c,
the
date
of
bankruptcy
is
the
origin
and
the
fixing
date
for
such
status
for
all
purposes
including
the
hypothetical
time
when
such
creditor
extended
a
credit.
he
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
it
held
contrary
to
that.
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
i
will
attempt
to
show
that,
justice
harlan.
the
second
rule
which
is
the
constance
rule
is
that
section
70c
invest
the
trustee
with
a
lien
creditor
status
at
date
of
bankruptcy
but
necessarily
involved
in
the
holding
in
constance
is
the
notion
that
the
trustee
has
some
kind
of
spiritual
--
simple
creditor
status
during
the
period
prior
to
bankruptcy
which
permits
him
to
rummage
an
indefinite
task
in
search
of
advantage.
it
suggests
some
preincarnate
life.
i
think
this
is
the
issue
and
i'd
like
to
say
to
eliminate,
perhaps,
some
side
considerations
that
there
is
no
dispute.
we
have
no
dispute
with
petitioner's
statement
that
the
source
of
these
trustee's
rights
are
section
70c
and
not
state
law.
we
have
no
dispute
with
the
notion
in
the
cases.
he
has
cited
that
the
trustee
has
an
ideal
creditor
status
at
date
of
bankruptcy
in
the
sense
that
he
is
deemed
to
accomplish
to
--
or
to
have
accomplished
all
of
those
things
necessary
to
perfect
his
status
as
a
lien
creditor
under
state
law
whether
that's
recording
and
notice
of
entry
of
judgment
or
other
procedural
rules.
we
do
say
that
the
fixing
of
the
point
of
time
when
the
trustee
assumes
a
juridical
personality
is
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
useful
at
this
juncture
to
look
at
70c
itself
as
amended
in
1952
because
there
are
two
separate
creditors
referred
to
and
i
think
this
may
be
a
source
of
some
of
the
difficulties.
the
language
says
now,
"the
trustee,
as
to
all
property,
whether
or
not
coming
into
possession
or
control
of
the
court,
upon
which
a
creditor
of
the
bankrupt
could
have
obtained
a
lien
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy."
now,
starting
here,
this
creditor
here
referred
to
is
what
we
might
call
a
property
defining
creditor.
this
is
a
test
used
to
define
the
property
to
which
the
trustee's
rights
--
upon
which
the
trustee's
rights
may
fasten.
proceeding,
we
say
that
the
trustee
has
two
such
property
so
defined
"shall
be
deemed
vested
as
of
such
date,"
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
"with
all
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
of
a
creditor
then
holding
a
lien
thereon,
then
holding
lien
thereon
at
date
of
bankruptcy,
whether
or
not
such
a
creditor,"
a
creditor
then
holding
a
lien
thereon
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
"exists".
now,
i
will
attempt
to
show
as
the
argument
develops
that
this
property
defining
creditor
first
referred
to
is
a
different
concept,
has
a
different
function
in
the
law,
a
different
history
than
the
hypothetical
creditor
that
we
tend
to
think
of
as
having
existed
for
many
years
in
the
bankruptcy
statute.
history
may
help
us
here.
an
appropriate
starting
point
is
the
case
bailey
versus
baker
ice
machine
in
1915
where
this
court
considered
the
operation
of
the
statutory
predecessor
section
47a
(2).
now,
it's
interesting
that
at
that
time,
the
statute
contain
no
date
fixing,
no
careful
time
fixing
language
and
the
court
was
left
to
reason,
logic
and
the
--
to
look
at
the
whole
bankruptcy
act
pattern.
and
the
court
said
some
interesting
things
in
that
opinion.
it
said,
first
of
all,
"we
have
no
guidance
in
the
statute
of
such,"
but
they
say
some
point
in
time
must
have
been
intended
by
congress.
now,
they
were
--
they
seem
to
negate
the
ambulatory
concept
that
is
--
is
essential
in
the
view
announcement
urged
by
petitioner.
secondly,
they
say
that
an
appropriate
time
and
the
appropriate
time,
if
not
otherwise
specified,
is
to
determine
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
of
this
trustee
and
"with
reference
to
the
conditions
existing
when
the
petition
is
filed".
in
choosing
this
state
of
bankruptcy,
they
noted
that
such
view
seems
reasonable,
absent
of
contrary
intent
of
congress
and
such
view
accords
with
other
provisions
in
the
act.
now,
subsequently,
congress
confirmed
or
--
or
it
codified
the
bailey
notion.
we
find
in
the
chandler
act
in
1938,
the
beginning
of
this
very
careful
language
where
they
refer
in
two
occasions
there
to
the
fact
that
he
is
vested,
as
of
the
date
of
bankruptcies,
with
the
rights,
remedies
and
powers
of
creditors
then
holding
a
lien
whether
or
not
such
a
creditor
exists.
again,
in
1950,
we
have
the
same
language.
substantially,
we
have
it
in
1952
in
the
present
statute.
now,
the
property
defining
creditor
has
a
different
history
in
that
--
in
the
chandler
act
of
1938.
the
court
will
recall
that
there
were
distinctions
as
to
the
creditors,
as
to
the
trustee's
rights
depending
upon
whether
the
property
was
in
the
possession
or
control
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
in
the
instance
where
it
was,
he
was
a
lien
creditor,
as
to
other
property,
he
was
a
judgment
creditor
holding
an
execution
duly
returned
unsatisfied.
this
distinction
was
abandoned
in
1950
and
congress
revamped
the
language
to
give
the
trustee
the
status
of
a
lien
creditor
whether
as
to
all
property,
whether
or
not
coming
into
possession
or
control
of
the
court.
trouble
the
language
seemed
rather
anomalous
because
it
conferred
upon
the
trustee
a
lien
upon
property
to
which
he
had
title
under
other
sections
of
the
act.
and
congress
noted
this
in
the
1952
amendment.
and
the
1952
amendment
which
first
brought
into
the
act
this
language
upon
which
a
creditor
of
the
bankrupt
could
have
obtained
a
lien
by
legal
or
equitable
proceedings
was
expressly
designed
to
eliminate
the
anomaly
of
1950
not
to
enlarge
any
previous
notion
as
to
the
trustee's
status.
now,
congress
has
more
contemporaneously
spoken
and
it
is
spoken
directly
to
the
point
to
the
question
raised
by
constance
v.
harvey.
after
the
decision
in
1954
of
constance
v.
harvey,
a
--
bills
were
introduced
in
congress
to
correct
what
was
believed
to
be
the
error
of
that
court.
in
1959,
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
favorably
recorded
out
h.
r.
7242
and
this
bill
and
in
their
report,
they
specifically
considered
constance
v.
harvey
and
referred
to
it
as
"statutorily
unwarranted"
and
went
on
to
say
"while
bankruptcy
is,
in
effect,
a
general
levy
on
the
property
of
the
bankrupt
for
the
benefit
of
his
creditors,
it
is
not
a
license
for
the
trustee
irrespective
of
prejudice
to
creditors
to
avoid
at
will
any
security
given
by
the
bankrupt
which
remained
imperfected
for
any
period
of
time
prior
to
bankruptcy".
yet,
this
is
the
effect
of
constance
v.
harvey.
they
concluded
that
the
doctrine
of
constance
v.
harvey
presents
a
very
real
threat
to
security
transactions,
the
validity
of
which
have
hindered
to
not
been
subject
to
challenge
under
the
act.
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
this
is
the
report
of
the
house
committee
on
the
judiciary
favorably
reporting
out
h.
r.
7242.
this
bill
passed
congress,
passed
both
houses
of
congress
in
the
recent
short
session.
it
was
vetoed
by
the
president,
however,
because
the
bill
also
contained
certain
provisions
changing
the
dignity
and
priority
of
federal
tax
liens.
the
president's
vetoed
message
is
quite
explicit
on
that
and
the
court
--
as
the
court
may
have
been
aware
that
treasury
had
difficulties
with
efforts
to
rationalize
this
federal
tax
lien
area.
the
president,
in
--
in
his
vetoed
message,
says
that
the
bill,
which
included
this
amendment
to
section
7c,
would
--
and
many
other
amendment
said
that
it
would
unduly,
unnecessarily
prejudice
to
sound
administration
of
federal
tax
laws.
i
think
that
was
the
only
reason,
perhaps,
where
this
case
is
now
for
the
court
instead
of
having
been
settled
by
congress.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sixth
circuit
decision
is
clearly
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
no,
sir
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
--
it
--
it
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
this
was
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
--
in
the
very
recent
short
session
after
the
nominations
just
last
september.
there
has
been
no
further
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
--
congressional
return
or
returning
the
bill.
but
the
--
the
president's
veto,
i
--
i
think,
was
clearly
prompted
by
the
treasury
concern
about
other
candidate.
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
if
there
was,
sir,
i'm
not
aware
of
it.
the
house
--
i
believe,
only
the
house
reported.
it's
quite
a
complete
report
and
it's
a
unanimous
report.
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
partisan
or
--
or
policy's
difference
here.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lewis
rule
is,
thus,
clearly
in
accord
with
congressional
intention,
contemporaneously
expressed
not
only
in
word
but
by
act,
and
that
there
is
very
little
doubt
as
to
what
congress
has
in
mind.
it
seems
to
me
this
might
be
dispositive
--
dispositive
of
the
case
here.
it's
significant
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
made
no
reference
to
what
congress
might
have
had
in
mind
in
this
area.
now,
also,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
lewis
rule
that
the
trustee
has
the
status
of
extending
credit
of
being
a
creditor
at
date
of
bankruptcy
also
fits
with
other
portions
of
the
act.
it
fits
with
the
general
policy
of
repose
you
see
in
the
bankruptcy
law.
for
example,
in
the
constance
case,
if
mr.
constance
had
taken
a
preference
in
that
case,
there
would
have
been
no
basis
for
the
trustee
on
to
settle
it.
if
at
that
time
that
the
transaction
successfully
challenged
had
entered
into,
he
had
entered
into
a
fraudulent
transaction
with
the
bankrupt,
the
time
limit
had
run.
here,
however,
under
the
constance
theory,
the
trustee
is
a
(inaudible)
fellow
roaming
back,
unsettling
arrangement
years
prior
to
bankruptcy.
there
is
no
time
limit.
it
indicates
the
wisdom
of
the
notion
in
bailey
that
some
time
must
be
fixed
here.
again,
the
presence
of
section
70e
in
the
act
is
at
least
an
indication
that
congress
intends
that
the
very
strong
rights
granted
there
required
a
presence
of
a
flesh
and
blood
creditor.
the
interpretation
placed
by
constance
on
this
present
section
70c
leaves
to
give
most
of
the
rights
to
70e.
counsel
has
attempted
to
dull
the
force
of
the
extravagant
results
of
--
of
constance
by
referring
us
to
moore
against
bay.
i
think
if
this
case
was
before
the
court
again,
it
might
be
recognized
that
moore
against
bay
--
bay
has
produced
some
inequities.
unfortunately,
that
is
completely
academic
because
moore
against
bay
has
been
codified
by
congress
as
part
of
70e
(2).
so
it
would
be
useless
to
say
that
its
results
are
extravagant,
they
are
the
intention
of
congress.
i
say,
in
this
area,
the
results
are
extravagant
and
clearly
not
the
intention
of
congress.
now,
what
purpose
does
the
constance
doctrine
advance?
the
lewis
interpretation
defeats
all
secret
liens.
it
accords
with
the
policy
of
repose
in
the
act.
it
does
not
put
a
man,
like
constance,
who
entered
into
a
bona
fide
sale
of
his
property
and
took
a
purchase-money
mortgage
back,
it
does
not
put
him
in
a
worse
position
than
if
he
were
conspiring
to
defraud
the
creditors
the
bankrupt
it
fits.
all
things
consist
under
the
lewis
interpretation.
now,
the
constance
theory
is
a
rather
interesting
one
with
all
due
respect
to
the
second
circuit.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
and
--
and
from
an
examination
of
the
briefs
and
records
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
certain
brief
filed
by
constance
here
that
the
problem
they
were
considering
was
not
fully
argued
by
counsel.
and
i
think
it's
also
fair
to
say
that
the
opinion
in
constance
is
not
completely
satisfying
in
exposing
what
the
real
rationale
of
the
court
was.
the
court
in
constance
cited
one
case,
hoffman
v.
cream-o-products.
this
is
clearly
a
lewis
case
in
the
sense
that
in
hoffman,
the
conditional
sale
contract
has
never
been
recorded
prior
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
it
offered
no
support
to
the
constance
theory.
but
what's
they
seem
to
consider
is
this
language
and
they
say
that
since
a
creditor
could
have
obtained
a
lien
and
they
seem
to
be
mixing
up
the
property
defining
language
in
70c
with
the
rights
fixing
language
at
the
end
of
70c.
conti
against
volper
which
is
the
second
decision
by
the
second
circuit
in
1956
is
one
paragraph
and
it
says,
it
seems
to
admit
the
results
produced
are
inequitable
and
then
it
again
recounts
this
language
that
since
a
creditor,
this
is
property
upon
which
a
creditor
could
have
obtained
a
lien,
ergo,
the
trustee
has
priority.
i
think
that
the
constance
doctrine,
as
developed
by
the
second
circuit,
is
based
on
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute
and
in
contrast,
petitioner
has
developed
a
super
structure
for
it
in
these
terms,
terms
which
the
court
in
the
second
circuit
has
never
announced.
the
--
the
theory
is
this,
"we
have
an
ideal
creditor
status."
he
refers
to
in
re
calhoun.
the
trustee
at
date
of
bankruptcy
is
in
the
most
favored
class
of
creditors.
the
unfortunate
thing
about
this
theory
is
that
we
are
not
limited
to
logic
chopping
in
trying
to
reach
a
result
here.
it
does
not
accord
with
congressional
intent.
it
has
no
warrant
in
the
case
law
and
it
produces
a
serious
amount
of
mischief.
first
of
all,
consider
the
statute
of
limitations
problem
under
the
ideal
creditor
theory
of
the
constance
theory.
where
does
this
thing
end?
at
what
point
can
a
court
restrain
the
unsettling
of
relationships
before
bankruptcy?
i
will
give
you
this
case
under
michigan
law
as
an
example.
it
is
a
case
in
which
i
am
involved
there
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
bank
took
a
mortgage
and
a
car
many
months
before
bankruptcy.
the
bankrupt
at
that
time,
he
defaulted
in
his
payments.
the
car
was
repossessed
and
sold
over
five
months
before
bankruptcy.
normally,
the
transaction
would
be
closed
then.
the
bank
has
disposed
of
the
car
and
has
recovered
the
proceeds.
chap
(ph)
filed
in
bankruptcy
as
i
say
over
five
months
after
this
occurred.
the
trustee
is
suing
us
for
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
that
car.
now,
this
is
relatively
current
time
before
bankruptcy
but
it
could
be
four
years
before
bankruptcy.
under
michigan
law,
if
constance
were
applied
in
1955,
if
the
bank
had
entered
into
this
chattel
mortgage
transaction
and
if
1956,
it
had
sold
the
car,
repossessed
and
sold
the
car,
i
see
no
logical
limit.
there
is
nothing
self
limiting
about
the
constance
doctrine
which
would
prevent
a
trustee
in
1960
from
proceeding
to
unsettle
this
relationship.
again,
we
have
bulk
sales
and
bulk
mortgage
statutes
in
our
state
as
to
many
states.
these
statutes
require
notices
to
actual
creditors.
if
we
can
posit
the
existence
of
--
of
an
interim
creditor
at
any
convenient
time
in
the
past,
then
we
have
a
case
where
our
bulk
sales
law
which
requires
notice
to
creditors
is
not
satisfied
if
the
seller
goes
into
bankruptcy
five
years
later
for
reasons
entirely
extraneous
to
the
sale
or
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
act.
the
--
the
mischief
indicated
here
is
just
based
upon
some
examples
in
michigan.
california
has
this
problem
very
seriously.
many
other
states
do.
and
the
whole
concept
of
an
interim
creditor
at
large
roaming
an
undefined
period
prior
to
bankruptcy
is
difficult
to
see
what
limits
might
be
drawn
by
the
court.
now,
counsel
for
petitioner
has
reviewed
the
case
law
attempting
defined
a
pedigree
for
the
constance
notion,
prior
to
constance.
a
great
number
of
cases
have
been
cited
in
both
briefs
and
i
think
we
have
both
(inaudible)
the
briefs.
there
were
many
more
cases
below.
but
to
cut
through
these
cases,
i
think
a
fair
review
of
the
history
of
them
prior
to
constance
would
show,
and
this
applies
in
re
calhoun
upon
which
he
so
greatly
relies,
that
in
all
of
these
cases,
the
same
result
obtains
if
we
conceive
of
the
trustee
as
extending
credit
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy,
which
by
the
way
was
professor
mclachlan
suggestion
in
harvard
as
--
and
was
the
language
used
by
congress
in
the
recent
amendment
that
he
is
the
creditor
extending
credit
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
most
of
the
cases
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
pardon.
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
no,
sir.
i
--
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
i
--
i
--
to
keep
the
brief
short,
i
referred
to
a
michigan
law
review
which
collects
almost
everything
and
i'm
sure
the
citation
is
in
there,
sir.
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
he
does.
mr.
richard
d.
rohr
so
most
cases
may
be
harmonized
with
the
view
as
the
calhoun
case.
and
there,
the
conditional
sales
contract
was
never
recorded.
so
it
--
it
offers
no
comfort
here.
and
the
other
cases
are
those
--
and
we
have
one
in
our
district
where
the
court
made
some
uncritical
references
to
section
70c
but,
in
each
of
those
cases,
there
were
some
existing
flesh
and
blood
creditors,
there
was
a
70e
basis
to
reach
the
result.
a
good
example
of
this
is
in
the
ninth
circuit
miller
v.
sellmeyer
(ph)
which
was
referred
to
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
this
decision,
the
court
is
somewhat
critique
about
it
but
i
checked
the
briefs
and
records
here
and
it
seems
quite
clear
that
there
were
$9000
of
credit
due
by
the
bankrupt
to
actual
creditors
at
date
of
bankruptcy
and
the
entire
case
turns
upon
moore
against
bay.
so,
in
reviewing
the
case
law
and
--
and
the
many
comments
thereon,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
yield
to
both
of
these
rules.
they
are
either
a
rule
where
an
extension
of
credit
at
date
of
bankruptcy
admits
the
result
from
the
court
or
a
section
70e
case
with
some
uncritical
language
to
references
to
section
70c.
to
summarize,
it
occurs
to
me
that
a
careful
reading
of
the
statute
and
a
careful
review
of
its
history
indicate
a
consistent
congressional
intent
to
fix
this
right,
this
creditor
status
at
the
date
of
bankruptcy.
you
see,
the
difficulties
with
the
ideal
notion
of
the
rummaging,
roaming,
(inaudible)
creditor
of
the
trustee,
it
--
it
has
no
limit
and
it
ignores
the
fact
that
when
congress
fixed
the
status,
they
admit
--
they
fixed
a
lien
creditors
status
at
date
of
bankruptcy,
the
term
"creditor"
is
just
a
component
of
that
status
and
why
that
should
be
broken
out
of
the
molecular
structure
in
roaming
at
large.
why
that
somehow
has
no
fixed
date
has
never
been
explained.
so,
it
does
accord
with
this
congressional
intent.
with
the
congressional
language,
it
accords
to
the
case
law
and
above
all,
it
permits
similar
pose
in
arrangements
long
prior
to
bankruptcy.
it
permits
a
consistent
interpretation
with
other
portions
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
it
permits
some
planning
in
security
law
which
is
most
important
for
the
benefit
of
all
members
of
our
society.
this
case,
as
the
court
knows,
involves
a
1953
automobile.
i
wouldn't
be
here
if
it
didn't
also
involved
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
where
the
consumer
paper
in
michigan
and
all
our
commercial
loans
have
been
troubled
by
this
problem.
prior
to
the
ameliorating
act
in
which
was
effective
this
march,
counsel
in
michigan
were
hard
put
to
give
an
opinion
that
any
chattel
mortgage
was
valid.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
consequences
alone
dictate
a
--
a
serious
review
of
constance
in
terms
of
its
rationale
and
resolved
and
its
rejection
by
this
court.
