is
there
any
--
was
there
a
senate
committee
report
that
made
any
reference
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
--
your
brief
with
reference
to
that
article
by
professor
mclachlan?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
i
--
it
was
--
i
had
read
it
at
a
time
but
forgot
where
it
was.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
used
some
strong
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
use
some
strong
language.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
--
about
the
abortive
legislature
passage
of
the
act
of
the
congress?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
in
district
court,
they
--
they
made
all
these
criticisms?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
at
the
time
moore
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
those
--
as
to
moore
and
bay
the
legislation
actually
passed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
the
significant
of
what
i
understood
to
be
the
legislative
history
of
the
last
session
of
congress,
significant
that
i
find
--
i'm
not
saying
it's
controlling
because
that's
--
there's
no
thing
that
raises
a
great
question
as
to
what
significance
you
attached
to
the
latest
congressional
attitude
that
does
not
actually
take
the
form
of
a
measure
on
the
statute.
but
if
(inaudible)
here
by
right
to
understood,
i
know
nothing
more
than
what
i've
heard.
then
here,
congress
actually
pass
legislation
undoing
the
result
no
matter
what
the
basis
of
--
for
it
was
of
the
constance
case,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
here,
we've
got
a
rather
unusual
situation
of
both
on
the
congress
agreeing
on
a
bill
which
spelled
by
the
president's
veto
unrelated
to
that
separate
measure.
i
just
wonder
to
what
kind
of
guidance
you
would
suggest
as
to
--
of
the
--
what
significance
should
be
attached
by
--
by
a
court
assuming
--
assuming
criticism
i
think
constance
was
right
to
decide
it.
i
can
assure
you
i
have
no
such
view
because
i
don't
know
enough
about
this
part.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
i
start
with
that,
what
--
to
what
extent
should
that
be
displaced
at
that
agreement
with
the
opinion
because
you
got
actually
an
enactment
so
it
fail,
as
i
said,
because
of
the
president's
veto
(inaudible)
unrelated
grounds.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
to
make
a
--
we
have
to
make
an
originating
construction
so
far
as
this
court
is
concerned
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
it
not?
because
this
question
hasn't
been
yield
the
fact
that
they
put.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
it
didn't
merely
saying
in
the
first
or
the
second
circuit
because
whenever
we
make
privately
take
(inaudible)
between
the
second
and
the
sixth,
can
we?
