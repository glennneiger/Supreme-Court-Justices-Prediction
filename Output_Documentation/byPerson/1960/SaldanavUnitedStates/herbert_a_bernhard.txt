mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
reinhardt
has
announced,
i
will
discuss
the
trial
errors.
our
basic
proposition
here
is
that
if
you're
going
to
force
a
man
into
a
trial
which
he
has
tried
to
avoid,
which
he
never
wanted,
which
he's
been
fighting
several
years
to
avoid
the
effects
of,
that
the
very
least
that
can
be
done
is
that
he'd
be
entitled
to
a
full
and
a
fair
and
a
proper
trial.
and,
we
contend
that
petitioner
did
not
get
such
a
full
and
fair
and
proper
trial
in
this
case
in
at
least
three
major
areas.
the
first
is
with
reference
to
the
fifth
count
of
the
indictment.
the
fifth
count
of
the
indictment
as
did
the
prior
three,
charged
sale.
the
first
count
was
a
conspiracy
count.
the
other
four
were
sales.
this
is
a
particular
importance
to
petitioner
here
because
any
error
in
this
count
was
certainly
prejudicial.
his
sentence
on
that
count
was
10
years
consecutive
to
the
other
counts.
now,
the
error
which
we
allege
with
respect
to
the
fifth
count
is
very
simply
that
our
timely
motions
for
judgment
of
acquittal
should
have
been
granted
on
this
count.
in
essence,
our
contention
is
that
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
crime
was
not
proven.
the
facts
are
very
simply
these.
in
the
first
three
sales,
the
arrangements
had
been
made
to
transfer
the
narcotics.
the
petitioner
brought
the
narcotics
to
his
buyer,
unbeknownst
to
him,
a
government
agent
licuanan.
he
handed
the
narcotics
to
licuanan.
licuanan,
in
the
first
two
cases,
examined
the
narcotics,
smelled
it
to
see
that
it
seemed
to
be
narcotic,
and
then
paid
over
the
money.
when
we
get
to
the
fourth
sale,
the
fifth
count,
we
have
a
somewhat
different
circumstance
and
we
say
that
this
is
decisive.
what
happened
here
was
that,
at
the
instance
that
petitioner
got
--
first
got
possession
of
these
drugs,
the
government
agent
came
over,
and
this
is
all
based
on
the
testimony
of
the
government
agents
and
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
this
testimony,
the
government
agent
came
over
while
petitioner
still
had
the
narcotics
in
his
hands
and
pulls
his
gun
and
placed
petitioner
under
arrest.
at
that
point,
the
petitioner
threw
the
bag
at
the
narcotics
agent
and
ran
away,
obviously
trying
to
escape.
he
didn't
make
it.
other
agents
captured
him
and
that's
how
we
stand.
now
petitioner
contends
that
this
was
perhaps,
a
contract
of
sale,
perhaps
it
was
an
attempt
to
sell,
but
it
was
no
sale
because
no
sale
ever
took
place.
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
no
delivery
but,
of
course,
the
statute
on
the
indictment
refer
to
sale.
we
say
that,
without
delivery
at
the
very
least,
perhaps
even
the
transfer
of
the
money
was
necessary,
but
without
delivery,
there
certainly
was
no
accomplished
sale.
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
there
had
been
no
transfer
of
the
money,
your
honor,
and
the
course
of
conduct
showed
that
the
money
was
always
transferred
after
the
actual
delivery
of
the
narcotics.
and,
i
must
say,
the
government,
on
page
37
of
its
brief
where
it's
talking
about
the
conspiracy
aspect
of
this
case,
concedes
that
deliveries
are
elements
of
sale
and
it
concedes
it
with
reference
to
these
deliveries
and
these
sales.
now,
there
is
just
no
doubt
that
there
was
no
delivery
in
this
case.
i
--
the
sale
is
something
which
is
not
a
continuing
course
of
conduct.
it
either
takes
place
or
it
doesn't.
and,
if
you're
going
to
have
a
seller,
you
must,
at
the
same
time,
determine
that
you
had
a
buyer.
you
have
got
to
find
some
instant
at
--
of
time
at
which
this
sale
took
place.
now,
there
is
no
basis
that
we
can
see
for
saying
that
the
mere
making
of
a
contract
was
the
conduct
which
was
proscribed
by
congress
when
it
forbad
the
making
of
sales.
this
is,
as
was
pointed
out
in
answer
to
questions,
is
a
very
serious
statute
containing
very
serious
penalties.
it
runs
from
5
to
20
years
as
an
absolute
minimum
without
possibility
of
parole.
the
cannons
of
construction
for
construing
criminal
statutes
recognizing
that
you
are
depriving
a
man
of
fundamental
rights
here,
and
his
right
to
life
and
liberty.
it
has
always
been
the
rule
of
this
court
that
these
statutes
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
the
gaps
are
not
filled
in
by
the
judiciary.
the
gaps
have
to
be
filled
in
by
the
congress,
if
there
are
any.
and,
i
may
point
out
that
this
statute
has
been
in
existence
for
over
50
years
in
this
particular
and
that,
notwithstanding
all
the
steps
that
the
congress
has
taken
to
change
the
law,
to
make
greater
penalties,
or
to
proscribe
other
conduct,
they
have
never
indicated
that
a
mere
executory
contract
of
sale
would
be
a
sale.
it
is
not
under
ordinary
sales
law.
it
is
not,
even
if
you
add
the
fact
of
appropriation
which
the
government
mentions
in
its
brief,
it
simply
does
not
constitute
a
sale
either
under
ordinary
sales
law
or
under
the
policy
which
we
contend
this
court
should
announce.
i
think
the
court
should
consider
that
this
is
not
ordinary
property
in
the
ordinary
sense.
this
is
something
where
there
really
is
no
title
interest.
you
can't
give
a
bill
of
sale
for
narcotics
and
have
it
enforced
in
the
courts.
the
only
real
interest
that
you
have
in
a
narcotic
is
the
possessory
interest
and
until
you
transfer
this
possessory
interest,
you've
transferred
nothing.
and,
i
think
that
this
is
the
way
it
should
be
as
a
matter
of
construction
of
this
law
because
if
you
were
to
take
the
government's
position
that
a
mere
executory
contract
of
sale
is
enough,
then
you
have
characterized
not
only
a
seller,
but
a
buyer
at
a
point
where
they
merely
have
the
intent,
perhaps,
to
go
ahead
and
subsequently
transfer
narcotics
and
you
have
then
said
that
both
of
these
people
can
be
tried
and
sentenced
to
a
minimum
of
five
years
without
possibility
of
parole.
we
simply
say
that,
on
the
facts
here,
there
was
no
delivery
and
without
delivery
in
this
case,
there
was
not
the
crime
comprehended
by
the
(inaudible).
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
there
was
no
specific
request
with
respect
to
count
5,
your
honor
--
there
--
with
respect
to
the
sale
aspect.
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
for
a
specific
instruction.
i
might
add
that
the
lower
federal
courts,
in
the
case
of
affronti
versus
united
states
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
has
held
that
a
defendant
was
not
entitled
to
an
instruction
on
the
sale
point,
that
this
was
obviously
used
in
narcotic
statutes
in
the
ordinary
and
popular
meaning.
i
should
clear
the
record,
the
affronti
case
did
not
deal
with
this
particular
statute.
it
dealt
with
a
different
narcotics
act,
but
our
point
here
is
that,
under
the
evidence
which
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
there
was
another
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
it
would
be
immaterial
what
instructions
we
were
requesting
or
not.
this
simply
was
not
the
corpus
delicti.
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
yes,
your
honor.
there
were
two,
one
at
the
close
of
the
government's
evidence
and
one
at
the
close
of
the
government's
--
of
the
entire
case,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
i'm
sorry,
sir?
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
yes,
the
second
one
specifically
said,
and
i
believe
you
will
find
that
on
page
114
of
the
record,
113,
the
motion
starts
and
then
mr.
reinhardt
says
“that
is
correct,
your
honor,”
meaning,
that's
his
motion
particularly
as
to
count
5
where
the
evidence
does
not
show
there
was
a
sale.
that's
114
of
the
record,
your
honor,
in
the
supplementary
record
which
was
printed.
turning
to
the
other
areas
of
error,
one
major
area
is
the
treatment
with
respect
to
the
informer
in
this
case,
mr.
singh.
now,
to
back
somewhat
on
the
facts,
this
was
a
typical
entrapment
situation.
i
don't
mean
by
that
that
entrapment
was
proven
but
what
i
mean
is
that
the
inducement
was
there.
mr.
singh,
who
was
the
informer,
mr.
licuanan
who
was
the
agent
in
the
case
approached
petitioner.
they
bore
a
note
from
petitioner's
cousin
who
was
in
jail
who
asked--
the
note
was
addressed
to
petitioner
and
had
asked
petitioner
to
help
these
two
people
to
get
some
money
from
narcotics
so
that
they
might
use
part
of
this
money
in
order
to
help
the
cousin
get
bail
and
get
out
of
jail.
the
entrapment,
if
there
was
any,
arises
out
of
this
initial
conversation
between
the
agent,
the
informer,
and
the
petitioner.
in
the
case
for
the
united
states,
the
united
states
simply
put
on
the
agent
but
it
did
not
call
the
informer.
at
first,
when
mr.
reinhardt
tried
to
find
out
the
name
of
the
informer,
this
was
refused
to
him.
when
he
cited
the
rivero
case
of
this
court,
the
united
states
changed
its
position
and
gave
him
the
name
and
they
promised
that,
the
following
morning,
the
man
would
be
in
court.
of
course,
this
was
in
a
trial
situation
and
he
had
to
--
when
singh
appeared
in
court,
mr.
reinhardt
was
conducting
the
trial.
there
was
some
discussion
between
the
court
and
mr.
reinhardt
as
to
what
sort
of
instruction
would
be
given
because
of
the
government's
failure
to
call
mr.
singh
as
a
witness,
and
the
court
said
“i
will
not
instruct
that
this
man
was
a
material
witness
to
the
government
and
that
his
testimony
should
be
presumed
to
be
adverse
to
the
government.
the
court
then
went
on
to
say,
when
mr.
reinhardt
said
“well,
we're
raising
the
issue
of
entrapment,”
the
court
then
went
on
to
say
“well,
if
he's
material
to
your
case,
i'll
give
an
instruction
against
you
if
the
government
requests
it.”
so,
at
this
point,
petitioner
is
faced
with
the
fact
that
he
is
irrevocably
bound
to
this
government
informer,
a
man
who
is
acknowledged
to
be
a
special
employee
of
the
government
who,
it
later
turns
out,
is
under
–
has
--
is
an
admitted
narcotics
user
and
has
not
been
prosecuted
for
that.
so,
the
government
has
this
over
his
head
and,
yet,
all
of
the
sudden,
he
becomes
our
man,
sort
of.
mr.
reinhardt,
during
lunch
time,
tries
to
talk
to
mr.
singh
and
finds
that
he
has
been
frustrated
in
that.
the
united
states
attorney
has
advised
mr.
singh
that
he
doesn't
have
to
talk
to
mr.
reinhardt.
so,
mr.
reinhardt
knows
nothing
now.
he
gets
no
information
from
mr.
singh.
this
is
in
the
face
of
the
rivero
case
of
this
court
where
this
court
has
said
the
question
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
informer
should
be
interrogated,
whether
his
story
should
be
put
on
the
stand
is
for
the
accused,
not
the
government,
to
decide.
and
then,
when
mr.
singh
is
finally
put
on
the
stand,
the
court
refuses
to
allow
mr.
reinhardt
to
treat
him
as
a
witness
hostile
ab
initio.
and,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
was
the
only
other
witness
to
the
entrapment
conversations
and
this
was
a
man
who
was
bound
to
the
government
not
only
because
of
the
us
advising
him
that
he
didn't
have
to
talk
to
mr.
reinhardt,
but
just
because
of
the
circumstances
that
the
united
states
had
even
indicated
that
if
they
gave
his
name,
his
life
might
be
in
jeopardy.
and,
that
was
of
--
the
implication
was
only
from
petitioner
and,
yet,
all
throughout
here,
we
are
not
allowed
to
treat
him
as
a
witness
adverse
to
us.
we
are
bound
by
his
testimony
if
we
call
him
and,
if
we
don't
call
him,
then
we're
going
to
get
an
instruction
that
his
testimony
would
have
been
adverse
to
us.
and,
we
say,
if
you
look
at
the
questions
that
were
asked,
some
of
them
were
valid,
whether
he's
a
hostile
witness
or
not.
we
questioned,
“are
you
an
employee
of
the
united
states
government?”
there's
certainly
nothing
wrong
with
that
question.
in
the
sherman
case
and
as
well
as
in
sorrow,
this
court
has
recognized
that
you
are
allowed
to
get
into
the
question
of
the
conduct
of
the
government
agents.
the
same
thing
with
the
other
questions,
they
were
proper
and
they
were
particularly
proper
in
this
circumstance
and,
in
effect,
here
was
an
entire
frustration
of
an
attempt
to
interrogate
and
bring
before
the
court
this
essential
witness.
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
yes,
sir.
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
the
entrapment
was
that
our
client
had
no
predisposition
to
engage
in
any
course
of
narcotic
activities,
that
there
was
no
intent
on
his
part
that
he
is
sitting
in
his
own
home,
he
is
approached
by
two
people,
one
is
a
government
informer
and
the
other
is
a
government
agent.
they
come
up
with
a
very
compelling
story
that
the
cousin
is
in
jail
and
that
he
can
do
something
for
his
cousin,
and
the
--
excuse
me.
they,
in
effect,
asked
him
for
help.
now,
there
is
a
lot
of
conflict
in
the
record
as
to
--
there's
no
dispute
as
to
what
help
was
requested
but
as
to
why
he
gave
help.
but,
our
theory
of
entrapment
is
that
there
was
no
prior
disposition
on
his
part
except,
of
course,
if
you
believe
some
of
the
statements
which
mr.
licuanan
made
in
his
testimony
and
which
could
have
been
rebutted
by
the
informer.
the
case
really
went,
mr.
licuanan
said
that
petitioner
had
boasted
that
he
sold
narcotics
the
day
before.
this
would
go
to
his
predisposition.
petitioner
denied
this.
this
was
supposed
to
have
taken
place
in
a
conversation
which
mr.
singh
was
present
and
it
is
this
sort
of
thing
that
we
tried
to
get
from
mr.
singh.
i
believe
we
would
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
--
mr.
herbert
a.
bernhard
--
if
it
may
please
the
court.
