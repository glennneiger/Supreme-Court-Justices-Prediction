mr.
reinhardt
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
reinhardt,
explain
that
again.
what
was
the
reason
you
wanted
an
immediate
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
he
was
not
sentenced
until
months
later
and,
meanwhile,
was
in
jail,
he
would
not
get
credit
for
the
time
then
being
served?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
they
had
a
date
from
the
actual
date
of
sentence,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
fact
that's
here?
is
that
as
so
interpreted?
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
100
years
total?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
it
20
years
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
--
what
sentences
were
finally
imposed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
originally
a
5
--
was
the
original
sentence
on
2,
that
is
after
the
trial,
was
that
concurrent
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
sentence
on
the
other
counts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
there
a
correction
here
of
some
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
the
waiver?
there
was
a
waiver
or
something
like
a
waiver
of
evasion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
am
i
correct?
was
the
word
“waiver”
used?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cox,
suppose
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
--
maybe
what
you're
referring
to
is
at
page
56.
i
can't
recall
offhand
but
i
believe
he
had
been
involved
a
conviction
of
narcotics
for
possession
of
heroin
in
los
angeles.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
at
57,
exhibit
number
5,
for
identification.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
upon
what
convictions,
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
he
to
be
resentenced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
point
is,
the
rule
--
if
we
are
to
follow
this
suggestion,
we
have
to
make
some
selection
of
the
convictions
upon
which
he
is
to
be
resentenced,
in
light
of
this
record?
we
can't
merely
send
it
back
for
resentence
on
2,
3,
4
and
5,
can
we?
