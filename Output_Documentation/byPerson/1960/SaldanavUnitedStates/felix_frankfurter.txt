justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
the
practice
is
to
dismiss
after
pleading
guilty
to
part
of
the
multiple-count
indictment,
is
it
equally
a
common
place
for
defendants
to
plead
guilty
to
some
count
and
go
to
trial
on
others?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
mean
this
is
a
rule
of
--
some
kind
of
a
rule
of
practice
that
if
you've
got
five
counts
and
they're
ready
to
plead
to
count
1
or
2,
but
want
contest
the
other
counts?
that's
automatically
a
dismissal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
contesting
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
all
depends.
of
course,
if
the
five
counts
are
variants
of
the
same
offense,
that
would
be
true.
if
there
are
five
counts
or
four
counts
or
whatever
the
multiple
may
be
and
the
district
attorney
has
a
non-committing
because
he
can't
commit
himself
to
talk
with
defendant's
counsel.
i
can
understand
that,
but
i'm
a
little
jolted
when
you
say
the
practice
is
that
if
you
have
five
counts
and
if
you
plead
guilty
to
some,
you
thereby,
normally
dismiss
the
others.
i'm
just
a
little
jolted.
it
may
be
so,
but
it
strikes
me
as
odd.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
it
doesn't
often
take
place.
i've
given
the
indic--
the
instances
or
the
formats
under
which
it
takes
place.
but,
if
you've
got
one
count
for
one
thing
and
another
count
for
an
unrelated
offense,
triable
at
the
same
time,
i
should
think
if
one
dug
out
the
cases,
you'd
find
as
many
non-practices
as
the
practice
you
gave.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
were
pled
to,
the
substantive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
may
be
some
kind
of
a
substantive
over
different
periods
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
this
is
it.
i'm
just
bothered
by
your
general
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
would
you
mind
to
put
parenthetically
what
sentences
could
have
been
imposed,
provided
he'd
been
tried
on
all
five
and
a
general
verdict
had
been
brought
in
or
if
you
plead
that
the
wri
--
a
particularized
guilty
on
each
of
the
five
counts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
the
question
has
anything
to
do
with
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
just
like
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
accumulated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
all
the
counts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
say
that
what
you
said
earlier
applies
to
whatever
may
be
the
generality?
are
you
saying
that
the
tendering
of
the
plea
of
guilty
and
its
acceptance
by
the
judge
was
an
implied
dismissal
for
all
practical
purposes
of
the
other
three
counts?
are
you
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
but,
legally,
the
legal
result,
the
legal
proposition
you're
tendering
is
in
the
context
of
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
context
of
what
took
place
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
on
1
and
2
was
a
dismissal
of
3,
4,
and
5.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
follow
that
but
that
as
the
solicitor
general
explained
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
means
five
years?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
you
invoked
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court
and
as
does
the
solicitor
general,
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
and
i
hope
you
may
care
to
make
comment,
this
question.
that
means
--
the
supervisory
power
means
we
should
tell
lower
courts
what
is
right
and
seemly,
that's
the
essence
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
isn't
--
it
isn't
--
if
it's
super
--
if
it's
supervisory
merely,
it
isn't
compelled
by
the
constitution
by
a
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
in
this
room,
the
space
that
is
left,
in
which
this
court,
as
the
apex
of
a
court
of
lower
courts,
has
therefore
has
some
playground,
some
direction
over
them
thereby
--
that's
what
i
meant
by
right
and
seemly
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
fair,
whatever
you
call
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
the
constitution.
it's
not
a
statute.
if
--
in
fact,
you
don't
have
to
do
anything.
you
just
accept
the
written
word.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
that's
the
fact.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
since
you
--
both
of
you
appeal
to
that,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this
question.
what
do
you
say,
not
that
i
expect
you
for
a
word
from
the
solicitor
general,
what
do
you
say
to
the
propriety,
i
use
the
word
“propriety,”
the
propriety
of
a
trial
judge
announcing
before
he
announces
sentence
what
he
plans
to
do?
what
do
you
think
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
this
case.
i'm
just--
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
to
get
light.
if
you're
going
to
--
if
we're
going
to
be
generally
overseeing
it
at
the
lower
courts,
for
me,
that
is
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
it's
part
of
the
sentence
then
i
don't
have
no
fight
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
was
unders
--
if
it
was
understood,
and
he
--
well,
assume
the
facts
would
warrant
my
question.
your
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
will
you
say?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
propriety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
not
an
idle
question
on
my
part.
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
a
good
reality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
ever
a
trial
judge
should
announce
“i'm
going
to
give
five
years
or
two
years
or
if
it
--
he
ought
ever
to
announce,
considering
the
fact
that
a
trial
judge
has
to
get
a
parole
report
--
has
to
get
a
report
from
his
social
agencies,
how
does
he
know
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
it
did?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
it
va
--
isn't
that
--
shouldn't
that
be
the
normal
course?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understand
the
two,
but
i'm
talking
--
we're
not
in
the
realm
of
supervisory
power,
namely,
how
a
trial
judge
should
conduct
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
that
most
trial
judges
should
--
i
should
think
if
this
court
had
a
chance
to
indicate
in
an
appropriate
case,
it
should
indicate
that
we've
got
that
system
so
that
they
should
inform
themselves.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
make
that
point?
justice
felix
frankfurter
forgive
me
for
interrupting
you,
mr.
solicitor.
is
the
probation
report
merely
for
purpose
of
deciding
whether
there
should
be
probation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
ask
in
order
--
because
i
had
assumed
that
that
was
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
the
ground
on
which
he
put
it
was
easy,
but
it's
useful
only
for
purposes
of
probation.
as
justice
stewart
said,
it's
a
presentence
aid,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
hope
i'm
not
interrupting
you,
mr.
solicitor,
when
i
refer
to,
what
i
shall
refer
to
earlier,
about
the
understanding
of
the
assumption
that
3,
4
and
5
would
be
dismissed.
i
certainly
wouldn't
draw
that
inference
from
what
took
place
after
the
clerk
called
the
court's
attention
to
it
on
page
17.
the
clerk,
“just
a
minute,
don't
go,
mr.
sheraton.
mr.
sheraton,
we
hold
thee.”
the
court,
“we're
going
to
hold
thee.
mr.
sheraton,
hold
those."
and
this
would
hold
the
disposition
without
any
word
from
counsel
for
defendant.but
that
doesn't
read
to
me.
i
don't
--
i'm
not
suggesting
--
i
don't
know
what
--
if
any
significance
it
has
but,
certainly,
one
cannot
attribute
into
the
significance
of
an
assumed
dismissal
of
the
other
counts
after
the
plea
of
guilty
to
1
and
2.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you'd
have
to
draw
that
out
of
the
air,
not
from
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
from
the
page
of
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
there
was
the
lawyer
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
was
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
would
lead
the
opposite,
if
anything.
i'm
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i'm
not
suggesting
what
the
meaning
of
it
is,
but
it
were
not
the
difficulty
of
sitting
here
in
judgment
on
what
took
place
to
human
voices.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
how
we
can
guess
that
when
we've
got
the
word
of
the
--
of
the
u.s.
attorney
that
these
counts
subsist
and
continued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
you
should
add
counsel
of
--
it
was
a
short
intermission.
i
don't
know
what
that
intermission
was
about.
i
don't
know
what
it
is
about.
if
i'm
to
go
and
sail
on
the
wide,
wide
ocean
of
speculation,
i
could
do
all
sorts
of
things.
i
think
myself,
the
sentence
--
the
whole
statute
scheme
for
narcotics
is,
for
me,
a
form
of
(inaudible)
i
think
the
sentences
are
outrageous.
i
think
they
are
self-defeating.
all
of
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
spirit
in
which
i
must
read
the
record.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
since
there's
a
break
in
your
argument,
may
i
intervene
for
a
minute
to
ask
you
to
explain
an
aspect
that
you
think
is
in
favor
of
what
judge
hall
did,
if
i
understood
you,
that
he's
a
believer,
as
i
think
rightly,
that
one
judge
should
dispose
of
a
case.
that
would
rather
indicate
that
judge
clark
should
have
pleaded
all
that.
he
began
this.
the
case
originated
before
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
--
the
general
principle,
no,
but
the
--
i
shouldn't
--
i
don't
think
it's
very
good
practice,
speaking
with
my
limited
experience,
to
have
pleas
of
guilty
--
pleas
on
some
counts
before
judge
1
and
trial
of
the
other
counts
before
judge
2.
that
certainly
is
not,
as
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
just
takes
pleas?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
--
and
--
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
routes
to
petitioner's
trials.
justice
felix
frankfurter
enlighten
me.
why
--
why
in
such
a
situation,
one
defendant
wants
to
plead
guilty
and
the
other
want
to
contest
it?
why
shouldn't
there
be
a
severance?
i'm
asking
to
be
enlightened.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
sentencing
of
the
--
of
the
plead
of
guilt
would
be
the
--
what
i
call
the
docket
judge
and
that
would
be
cleaned
up
in
the
trial
(inaudible)
he
might
have
his
own
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
chief
--
as
chief
judge
here,
he
has
more
official
responsibility
for
oversight
of
the
district
and
the
other
judge
can
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
he
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
implicit
in
your
suggestion
that
the
expectation
of
a
five-year
sentence
was
communicated
to
the
defendant
through
counsel
and
in
reliance
thereon,
they
took
action,
which
otherwise
they
would
not
have
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then,
what
--
what's
the
basis
of
--
what's
the
basis
of
fairness?
disappointed
hopes
which
all
of
us
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'd
like
to
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'd
like
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
isn't
reliance
--
if
it
isn't
reliance,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
one
judge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
judge
having
said
something
and
it
has
--
it
was
not
made
good
on
by
the
outcome,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
if
it
gets
down
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
was
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
may
i
analyze
your
answer.
i
start
out
by
saying
i'm
a
great
disbeliever
in
severe
sentences
in
any
way.
i
don't
believe
much
in
the
reformative
quality
or
power
or
heavy
sentences.
and
i
don't
think,
either,
they
are
necessary
for
the
protection
of
society.
putting
that
to
one
side,
i
am
with
you.
i
--
you
can't
be
too
fastidious
for
me
in
the
comic
of
a
criminal
trial
by
the
government,
but
we
are
sitting
here
as
a
reviewing
court.
we've
got
to
review
something.
somebody
must
have
done
something
he
shouldn't
have
done,
either
because
the
constitution
or
the
law
or
a
statute
or
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
was
improper
or
unseemly,
call
it
what
you
will.
i
don't
see
that
outside
of
that,
we
have
any
power.
we
can't
say
it'd
be
nicer
if
the
criminal
--
if
criminal
administration
is
full
of
things
that
are
offensive
to
me,
and
i
can't
say
that
the
exercise
of
the
individual
power,
i,
as
a
voter
on
this
court,
will
say
it
should
be
done
differently.
so,
i
would
like
to
have
pointed
out
to
me
someone
specific
reprehensible
conduct,
someone
specific
misuse
of
power,
someone
specific
utterance
by
a
court
relied
upon
to
the
disadvantage
of
a
defendant,
someone
specific
choices
open
to
a
judge
when
he
should
have,
in
mercy,
taken
some
other
choice,
and
i
don't
mean
if
he
has
filed
the
20
years
that
i
can
say
he
should
have
given
him
only
18
years
or
pursued
only
5
years.
but
something
else
than
the
operation
of
the
--
of
the
machinery
or
the
processes
of
the
standards
of
law
not
directed
toward
against
this
individual,
but
in
the
sum
total
operating
in
a
way
that
i
don't
think
is
good
administration.
am
i
asking
for
too
much?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
judge
clark
in
the
holding
of
criminal
calendar?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
why
it's
necessary
for
--
it
should
be
taken
into
account
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
your
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
--
the
gravamen
of
your
difficulties,
god
knows
i
am
sympathetic
with
it,
i've
said
earlier
that
i
regard
these
narcotic
sentences
as
outrageous,
but
the
gravamen
of
your
objection
goes
to
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
judgment.
the
fact
that
he
was
promised
5
by
a
holding,
he
got
20
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
now,
your
argument
would
be
perfect,
perfect
before
the
english
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
its
statutory
power
to
bury
the
sentence,
but
this
court
has
no
such
power
unless
there's
some
abuse
somewhere
along
the
line.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
those
two
do,
then
they
do.
then,
you've
--
you've
answered
--
then,
you've
taken
care
of
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
those
will
do,
then
you've
taken
care
of
it.
if
there's
been
an
abuse
of
discretion,
then
--
then
i
have
no
difficulty.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
if
you
have
no
abuse
of
this
question
anywhere,
if
you
have
no
misconduct,
no
non-allowable
choice
to
the
judge
you
had
the
responsibility
and
what
weighs
with
you
is
the
excessive
sentence,
then
i
put
it
to
you,
i
submit
with
all
respect,
what
you're
doing
is
asking
this
court
to
bury
sentences.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suggesting
to
us
that
there's
an
agreement
between
the
u.s.
attorney
and
the
judge
which
was
not
--
which
was
then
frustrated?
are
you
suggesting
that
to
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
has
held
again
and
again
such
an
agreement
is
--
is
improper
and
it
has
refused
to
enforce
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
--
but
if
then
this
is
an
agreement
between
counsels
for
the
defendant,
i'm
being
almost
the
devil's
advocate
but
i
think
we've
got
such
a
thing
as
orderly
administration
of
appellate
reviews,
and
i
want
to
know
what
it
is
i'm
doing
when
i'm
simply
asking
us
to
do
something
out
of
the
goodness
of
my
heart
when
i'm
asked
to
do
a
legal
act.
they
are
very
different
for
me.
the
agreement
between
counsel
and
the
u.s.
attorney
doesn't
enter
into
this
thing
at
all,
does
it?
not
at
all.
if
then
you
--
then
you
are
driven
back
to
saying
it
doesn't
enter
it
except
in
his
own
expectations.
and
i
can
--
i
don't
know
how
many
cases
they
are
in
which
those
expectations
are
constantly
frustrated
on
the
face.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
so
that
it's
the
trial
judge's
conduct
that
is
decided
here,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
and
if
you
tell
me
--
if
you
tell
me
that
you
can
argue
solidly
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
honor
that,
later
on
by
judge
hall,
or
to
frustrate
it
by
having
him
put
on
trial,
i
understand
that,
but
you
can
tie
up
the
agreement
between
the
u.s.
attorney
and
counsel
for
this
defendant
with
the
fact
that
the
judge,
thereafter,
acted
on
it
of
his
own
spontaneity,
except
you
can't
tie
those
together
and
get
some
extra
advantage
or
--
or
element
of
unfairness
out
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
it
very
well,
but
i
should
say
the
ultimate
reason
is
that
there
wasn't
enforced
a
rule
of
court
such
as
there
is
now.
that's
the
real
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
clearly
where
you
what?
i
didn't
get
the
other
word.
that's
clearly
where
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
this.
suppose
it's
the
other
way
around.
suppose
--
suppose
clark
had
been
hall
and
hall
had
been
clark,
and
suppose
clark
had
given
20
years
and
then,
when
it
came
before
hall,
mild
hall
not
real
hall,
mild
hall
and
he,
out
of
a
sense
of
leniency
or
sympathy
with
and
disapproval
of
the
heavy
offense
and
said,
“well,
if
--
if
we
go
to
trial,
we
let
it
go
to
trial
on
the
whole.”
i
don't
think
you'd
be
here
today,
would
you?
so,
when
you
talk
about
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
there
wouldn't
be
power
--
there
wouldn't
be
power
to
vacate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
but
there
wouldn't
be
power
if
a
judge,
out
of
his
sense
of
fairness,
he
calls
on
a
plea
of
guilty
misunderstood
or
misconceived
by
the
defendant
as
dismissing
the
others,
gave
a
sentence
that
he
thought
was
raw
and
therefore,
he
wanted
to
have
us
the
whole
disposition
before
his
more
compassionate
heart
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
the
judge
has
no
such
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
a
defendant
can
play
one
game
or
the
other,
depending
how
--
what
the
sentence
of
the
prior
judge
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
argument
implied
that
if
you
did
--
had
not
consenting,
there
would
be
no
such
power,
although
the
motive,
so
far
as
it's
going
to
motive,
of
the
mild
judge
hall
would
have
been
the
opposite
of
the
severe
judge
hall.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
have
--
you
could
have
made
that
clear
by
just
a
few
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
--
you
mean
it
is
a
practice?
you
talk
about
rituals.
you
mean
to
say
that
the
practice
when
pleas
of
guilty
are
tendered
and
accepted
to
counts
1
and
2
and
3,
4
and
5
are
to
be
dismissed.
it's
the
practice
to
make
another
proceeding
of
that
at
some
other
time?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
little
too
much
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
reinhardt
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
you
forgive
me
--
would
you
forgive
me
if
i
point
out,
if
you
just
used
the
phrase
that
rather
supports
judge
hall's
saying
there
was
an
appearance.
you
mean
the
phrase
"court-approved
settlement",
that's
just
what
judge
hall
thought
of
your
court-approved
settlement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court-approved
--
a
court-approved
settlement
is,
to
me,
something
different
from
a
court's
own
disposition.
justice
felix
frankfurter
settlement
implies
an
--
never
mind.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there's
some
basis
which
judge
hall
is
thinking
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
the
--
there's
the
--
the
eternal
difference
in
life
between
appearance
and
reality.
you
may
have
been
a
--
a
thing
may
have
been
as
innocent
as
could
be,
but
the
appearance
was
that
there
was
a
--
a
court,
a
harmony,
the
opposite
of
dissonance
between
counsel
and
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
difference
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
believe
me,
i
followed
your
argument,
and
i
think
that
i
understand
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is,
but
it's
rebuked
constantly
from
the
bench,
and
this
court
has
rebuked
it
from
time
to
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
the
fact,
as
i
asked
you
about
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
remotely
suggesting
impropriety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
appearance
is
not
impropriety.
