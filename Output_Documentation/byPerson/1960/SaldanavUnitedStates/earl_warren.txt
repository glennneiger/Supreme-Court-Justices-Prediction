chief
justice

warren
leonard
saldana,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
reinhardt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
bernhard
may
be
so
admitted
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
reinhardt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
a--
he
pleaded
guilty,
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
guilty,
yes,
i
thought
so.
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
at
the
time
that
he
granted
the
continuance
of
two
weeks
to
palomino?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
was
without
the
presence
of
any
of
the
parties
to
your
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
bernhard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
had
been
no
transfer
of
the
money.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
so.
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh!
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
solicitor
general,
i'm
just
wondering
though,
in
the
--
in
the
light
of
everything
that
happened
there
and
the
fact
that
the
judge
had
the
indictment
before
him
with
the
--
with
the
five
counts
and
the
district
attorney
accepted
the
plea
to
two
counts,
and
the
judge
said,
“i'm
--
i'm
going
to
give
you
five
years.”
i
wonder
if
it
isn't
a
fair
interest
from
everything
that
was
said
there
that
the
judge
had
in
mind
that
all
he
was
to
suffer
as
a
result
of
--
of
that
proceeding
was
five
years
for
his
crime.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
your
own
way.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
i'm
just
wondering,
when
--
when
it
goes
--
goes
to
that
trial
judge
and
he
vacates
the
plea,
does
he
arraign
him
again
and
ask
him
what
his
plea
is?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
suppose
he
says
--
he
says
“i
plead
guilty
again”
and
the
other
--
the
other
defendant
says
“i
plead
not
guilty.”
what
happens
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
--
so
a
man
would
be
deprived
sometimes
and
not
--
not
too
seldom
either
for
a
period
of
maybe
some
months
before
he'd
be
permitted
to
plead
guilty
and
get
a
second
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
his
judgment
--
but
the
sentence
wouldn't
be
passed
and
i
--
i
suppose,
if
his
counsel
suggested,
in
the
case
like
--
like
this,
his
time
wouldn't
start
to
run
until
he
was
sentenced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
not
in
this
court,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
we
say
that
he's
more
familiar
than
judge
clark?
they're
both
been
there
for
a
number
of
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
not
for
--
not
for
the
length
of
sentences.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor
general,
may
i
--
may
i
suggest
this,
and
--
and
it's
in
keeping
with
what
you
have
said,
but
doesn't
it
fair
on
this
--
on
--
on
your
answer
to
justice
frankfurter
that
before
these
people
went
into
court,
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
spoke
to
the
united
states
attorney,
and
the
--
the
united
states
attorney,
recognizing
that
he
was
willing
to
plead
guilty
to
some
phase
of
this
indictment,
said
to
him
or
indicated
to
him
that
in
accordance
with
the
practice
in
that
kind
of
cases,
if
he
pled
guilty
to
--
to
two
counts
of
--
of
an
indictment,
of
a
number
of
more
counts,
that
that
was
the
end
of
the
situation
and
that
pursuant
to
that
agreement,
apparently,
both
of
them
went
into
court
and
this
man
pled
guilty
to
--
to
two
counts
of
the
indictment
and
the
judge,
only
after
he
had
pled
guilty
and
with
the
intention
of
--
of
sentencing
him
at
that
time,
said
that
the
sentence
should
be
five
years.
is
–
isn't
that
about
what
happened
or
is
that
wrong?
if
that
is
wrong
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
no
such
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
implication
in
what
i
said.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
--
i
said,
so
far
as
the
--
the
fairness
of
that
is
concerned
to
--
to
this
--
this
man,
isn't
it
a
fact
that
he
went
first
to
the
united
states
attorney
and
--
and
--
the
counsel
did
and
told
him
that
his
client
was
willing,
under
certain
circumstances,
to
--
to
plead
guilty
to
--
to
this
indictment
and
he
was
given
to
understand
by
the
united
states
attorney
that
in
--
in
accordance
with
the
usual
practice
in
this
kind
of
case,
that
a
plea
to
two
counts
of
the
indictment
would
take
care
of
the
entire
indictment
and
the
--
the
rest
would
--
would
be
disposed
of.
and
there
was
an
agreement
on
1
and
2.
they
went
into
the
court.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
1
and
2.
and
the
court,
intending
to
sentence
him,
let's
say,
just
on
--
on
1
--
1
and
2,
said
--
said
to
him,
“i
--
i
propose
to
give
you
five
years.
that's
about
as
good
as
you
could
expect.”
and
--
and
the
man
pled
guilty
under
those
--
under
those
conditions
and
of
course,
he
expected
to
--
to
get
the
others
dismissed.
i
don't
say
the
judge
said
anything,
did
anything
or
paid
any
order
or
anything
of
--
of
that
kind,
but
is
--
is
that
an
unfair
way
to
--
to
present
the
--
the
appearance
of
the
defendant
for
this
court
for
sentencing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
all
i
wanted
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
is
--
please,
proceed
mr.
solicitor.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
--
you
may
take
this
opportunity.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
take
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
take
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wouldn't
be
mine.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
i
wouldn't
buy
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
reinhardt.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
reinhardt,
on
--
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
express
our
appreciation
to
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
--
and
to
your
associate,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
mr.
bernhard.
i
get
the
name
is
so
alike.
i
--
i
get
to
be
confused.
we
always
feel
comforted
when
--
when
lawyers
will
undertake
these
--
the
defense
of
indigent
defendants,
such
as
you
have
and
particularly
when
they
carry
them
through
with
the
diligence
that
--
that
you
have.
and
we
express
our
deep
appreciation
to
--
to
both
of
you.
and
may
i
say
also,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
--
that
we're
deeply
comforted
also
by
the
very
frank,
very
fair
and
very
generous
manner
in
which
--
which
you
have
conducted
this
--
in
this
case.
and
i'm
sure
that
the
cause
of
justice
will
--
will
never
suffer
when
men
will
undertake
the
cause
of
indigent
defendants
such
as
you
have
here
and
the
solicitor
general
will
be
as
fair
as
he
has
in
this
case,
so
we
thank
you
both.
