mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
commencing
the
oral
argument,
i
would
like
to
move
the
admission
of
mr.
herbert
bernhard
pro
hac
vice.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
us
cir--
us
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
involves
a
criminal
conviction
of
the
petitioner.
the
conviction
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
on
june
16,
1958,
the
petitioner
was
arraigned
before
judge
thurmond
clark.
the
petitioner,
at
that
time,
being
indigent,
did
not
have
counsel.
a
counsel
from
the
indigent
defendant
panel
was
appointed
at
that
time.
thereupon,
judge
clark
suggested
that,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
co-defendant
in
the
case
who
is
pleading
guilty
at
the
same
time,
that
petitioner
plead
guilty
as
to
all
five
counts
of
the
indictment.
the
petitioner
then
pleaded
guilty.
following
that
plea
and
arraignment,
court-appointed
counsel
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
pleaded
not
guilty.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
petitioner
pleaded
not
guilty
to
all
five
counts.
following
that
plea
and
arraignment,
court-appointed
counsel,
and
i
was
the
court-appointed
counsel,
consulted
with
petitioner
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
offense
and
what
petitioner's
wishes
were.
following
consultation
with
petitioner,
following
an
investigation
of
the
facts,
it
was
determined
that
petitioner
would
plead
guilty,
petitioner
acknowledging
that
he
did
commit
the
offense.
thereupon,
consulted
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
inquired
as
to
the
disposition
which
would
be
acceptable
to
the
united
states
attorney's
office.
the
united
states
attorney's
office
advised
that,
as
a
matter
of
course
in
proceedings
of
this
nature,
pleas
would
be
accepted
to
a
lesser
number
of
counts
and
that
the
acceptable
number
in
this
case
would
be
two.
thereupon,
it
was
agreed
between
the
united
states
attorney
and
petitioner's
counsel
that
a
plea
of
guilty
would
be
entered
on
two
counts.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
i
think
they
appear
in
–
at
--
on
page
27,
i
believe,
there's
a
statement
which
i
made
to
the
court
at
that
time.
yes
your
honor,
page
27
of
the
record
where
i
advised
the
district
court
of
this
fact.
this
was
before
judge
hall.
now,
i
should
state
further,
in
this
connection
that
on
june
16th
when
the
arraignment
proceedings
were
held
and
when
petitioner
pleaded
not
guilty,
the
case
was
set
on
the
trial
calendar
for
july
15,
which
was
a
time
at
which
judge
peirson
hall
would
have
taken
over
the
trial
calendar.
in
the
district,
the
judges
serve
successive
terms,
and
therefore,
the
case
was
placed
on
the
calendar
at
a
time
after
which
judge
hall
would
have
taken
over.
now,
prior
to
the
time
that
judge
hall
would
have
taken
over
or
did
take
over
the
trial
calendar,
following
the
conference
with
the
united
states
attorney,
i
requested
the
united
states
attorney
to
place
the
matter
back
on
the
calendar
for
a
change
in
plea.
the
united
states
attorney
did
this
at
my
request
and
placed
it
on
the
calendar
of
the
tri--
of
the
judge
who
was
then
presiding
over
the
criminal
calendar,
who
was
judge
thurmond
clark.
when
this
took
place
on
june
26th,
at
which
time,
i
appeared
with
petitioner
before
judge
clark
and
moved
for
a
change
of
plea.
the
plea
was
changed
on
counts
1
and
2
and
petitioner
at
that
time
stated
that
he
wished
to
plead
guilty
to
counts
1
and
2.
i,
then,
requested
judge
clark
to
impose
an
immediate
sentence.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
the
plea
was
accepted
on
ent
--
on
counts
1
and
2.
i
believe
that
this
will
appear
on
either
15
or
16
of
the
record
--
on
page
15
and
16,
and
i
believe
it
will
appear
also
in
the
minute
orders,
although
i'm
not
sure
what
page
of
the
record.
in
any
event,
following
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
by
judge
clark,
i
asked
--
requested
immediate
sentence
on
the
grounds
that
the
petitioner
would
get
no
credit
for
any
time
that
he
served
while
awaiting
sentence
because
there
was
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence
of
five
years
with
no
possibility
of
probation
and/or
parole.
so,
i
asked
for
an
immediate
sentence.
judge
clark,
then,
responded
and
said
that
he
would
be
willing
to
impose
or
would
impose
a
sentence
of
five
years
to
run
concurrently
on
each
count
and
it
--
that
it
would
take
effect
immediately.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
he
had--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
the
first
reason
was
that
i
did
not
want
petitioner
to
stay
in
jail,
serving
time
for
which
he
would
receive
no
credit.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
he
would
not
get
credit
because
there
was
a
mandatory
minimum
of
five
years
and
that
if
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
that
was
where
i
understood
the
practice
to
be,
that
the
--
that
the
sentence
would
be
four
to
five
years
and
that
it
would
be
effective
as
of
the
date
of
sentence.
now,
it
is
possible
that
the
court
might,
under
some
circumstances,
i
don't
know,
be
able
to
enter
a
retroactive
sentence.
but,
the
reason
i
gave
at
that
time,
and
this
was
the
reason
that
i
had,
was
that
i
felt
that
he
should
not
serve
dead
time
and
that,
ordinarily,
credit
is
not
given
for
dead
time.
so,
i
--
in
that
--
upon
my
request
for
an
immediate
sentence,
the
court,
as
i
indicated,
announced
that
the
sentence
would
be
five
years,
concurrent
on
each
count.
at
that
point,
the
assistant
us
states
attorney
objected.
his
objection,
as
he
stated,
was
not
as
to
the
length
of
the
sentence,
but
as
he
said,
policy-wise,
he
objected
to
the
imposition
of
the
sentence
on
a
man
when
there
was
a
co-defendant
who
had
not
yet
been
tried.
judge
clark
explained
his
objection
by
stating
that
the
government
was
afraid
that
if
the
petitioner
was
sentenced,
then
he
would
be
free
at
the
trial
of
the
co-defendant
to
take
the
stand
and
testify
for
the
co-defendant
and,
the
government
wanted
to
avoid
this.
i
replied
to
judge
clark
that
i
felt
that
this
was
not
a
valid
reason
to
delay
the
sentence.
that,
in
the
event
that
petitioner
perjured
himself
at
a
subsequent
trial,
that
the
solution
to
that
was
to
try
him
for
perjury,
but
that
it
was
not
a
proper
practice
to
keep
a
man
in
jail
awaiting
sentence
in
order
to
ensure
his
testimony
at
a
subsequent
trial.
that,
in
fact,
this
was
inconsistent
with
the
administration
of
justice
because
it
did
not
encourage
truthful
testimony,
but
it
kept
a
club
hanging
over
the
head
of
a
man
who
was
awaiting
sentence,
and
that
sentence
should
not
be
delayed
for
this
purpose.
in
response
to
my
argument,
judge
clark
said
“well,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
your
defendant
because
i
have
given
you
my
word,
and
i
give
you
my
word
now,
he
will
be
returned
here
after
the
trial
of
the
co-defendant
and
he
will
be
sentenced
to
five
years.
i
give
you
my
word
on
that.”
the
next
event
that
took
place
and
this
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
but
it
is
my
way
of
explanation,
is
that
i
received
a
telephone
call
from
the
clerk
that
the
--
that
judge
hall
had
taken
jurisdiction
over
the
petitioner.
now,
the
record
shows
that,
on
july
9th,
the
co-defendant,
palomino,
who
was
set
for
trial
before
judge
hall
moved
for
a
continuance.
judge
hall
granted
the
continuance
of
the
trial
until
july
29th,
a
delay
of
two
weeks,
and
that
the
record
shows
that
this
was
ex
parte.
it
was
an
ex
parte
hearing
that
the
petitioner
was
not
there,
petitioner's
counsel
was
not
there,
and
it
is
unclear,
although
i
do
not
believe,
the
united
states
attorney
was
there
either.
at
this
proceeding
concerned
with
palomino
alone,
judge
hall
ordered
petitioner
transferred
before
him
for
sentencing.
as
the
record
later
reveals,
the
reason
that
judge
hall
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
as
i
stated,
i
was
advised
of
this
by
phone
and,
prior
to
the
date
at
which
petitioner's
next
hearing
was
scheduled,
which
was
july
21st,
the
date
that
he
would
ord
--
that
he
was
set
for
sentencing,
i
spoke
to
judge
hall
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
was
advised
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
appear
until
july
29th
in
view
of
the
continuance.
now,
the
record
is
somewhat
unclear
as
to
this,
except
that
the
united
--
assistant
united
states
attorney's
statement
is
set
forth
at
pages
19-20
of
the
record,
i
believe,
yes,
your
honors,
it's
at
page
--
pages
19-20
where
the
united
states
attorney
explains
this.
in
any
event,
the
proceedings
were
held
by
judge
hall
with
respect
to
--
on
july
21st
and
22nd,
but
petitioner's
counsel
was
not
there
because
judge
hall
had
stated
that
he
would
not
sentence
until
july
29th
since
he
had
continued
the
trial.
now,
on
july
29th
was
the
next
time
that
petitioner's
counsel
appeared
in
court,
and
this
was
before
judge
hall
pursuant
to
the
advice
i
had
received
that
the
case
had
been
transferred
to
him.
on
july
29th,
the
court
was
advised
that
palomino
had
skipped
bail.
now,
as
i've
indicated,
the
explanation
that
judge
hall
had
given
as
to
why
he
transferred
petitioner
was
that
he
didn't
want
to
take
a
half
of
a
case.
he
believed
that
if
he
were
going
to
try
one
defendant,
he
should
also
sentence
the
co-defendant.
now,
palomino,
having
disappeared,
there
was
no
trial
pending
for
him
and
all
that
was
left
before
judge
hall
now
was
the
petitioner.
when
the
clerk
announced
that
petitioner
was
here
and
was
here
for
sentencing,
judge
hall
said
“well,
i'm
not
going
to
sentence
him
now.”
at
that
point,
i
stated
to
judge
hall,
began
to
explain
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
how
petitioner
had
appeared
before
him,
and
began
to
make
a
motion
to
transfer
the
case
back
to
judge
clark.
judge
hall,
before
i
completed
my
entire
explanation,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
this
apparently
smacks
too
much
of
having
the
appearance
of
a
burden.
that
if
petitioner
would
plead
guilty,
he
would
get
five
years.
now,
this
conclusion
is
wholly
without
support
in
the
record
or
in
fact.
this
is
a
conclusion
of
judge
hall's,
for
which
there
may
be
explanations
with
relation
to
the
problems
that
may
exist
in
the
district
court
in
southern
california,
but
as
to
which
petitioner
was
wholly
innocent.
there
was
nothing
that
would
justify
the
smacking
of
the
appearance
of
a
deal
in
judge
hall's
court
and
judge
hall's
words,
and
he
made
no
inquiry
or
no
attempt
to
find
out
any
facts
or
to
explore
any
facts
which
might
support
this
conclusion
of
his.
rather,
he
said
that,
because
it
might
have
the
appearance
of
a
deal,
he
would
vacate
the
pleas
and
order
the
defendant
to
trial.
despite
petitioner's
objections,
judge
hall
did,
in
fact,
vacate
the
pleas
of
guilty
and
set
the
entire
case
for
trial
approximately
10
days
later.
now,
on
august
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
glad
you
asked
that.
i
should
have
mentioned
counts
3,
4,
and
5
at
the
time
i
described
the
change
of
plea.
at
the
time
of
the
change
of
plea,
when
the
guilty
pleas
were
accepted
on
counts
1
and
2,
the
clerk
of
the
court
said
“we
have
counts
3,
4,
and
5.”
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
then
said
“hold
those,”
and
the
court
said
“yes,
hold
those.”
now,
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
record
that
the
intention
of
all
of
the
parties
in
--
the
court,
the
united
states
attorney,
and
the
petitioner
was
that
these
counts
would
not,
thereafter,
be
subject
to
trial.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no
your
honor,
i
don't
believe.
if
that's
what
he
was
referring
to,
i
think
it's
an
appropriate
in
the
proper
deal.
i
don't
think
that's
what
he
meant
because
he
said
“a
deal
that
if
he
would
plead
guilty,
he
would
get
five
years”
and,
this
sort
of
a
deal
there
never
was.
there
was
no
discussion
with
the
united
states
attorney
about
this,
never
any
suggestion
that
there
would
be
--
no
mention
of
sentence
at
all
until
judge
clark,
in
open
court,
announced
the
sentence.
however,
the
status
of
3,
4,
and
5
was
discussed
with
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
acceptance
of
a
plea
to
2
would
be
a
disposition
of
the
entire
case,
and
i
think
that
the
record
shows
that
the
--
there
can't
be
any
question
that
this
was
the
intent
of
everybody.
one
illustration,
i
believe,
is
the
fact
that
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
wanted
counts
1
and
2,
the
sentences
on
those
counts,
held
in
order
to
ensure
the
testimony.
and
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
i
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor,
i
include
judge
clark.
the
pact
that's
in
the
district
court
has
been,
and
i
know
it
is
a
pact
that's
in
the
district
court
in
washington,
has
been
that
pleas
--
when
a
guilty
plea
is
entered
to
a
lesser
number
of
counts
that,
at
the
time
of
sentence,
the
remaining
pleas
are
dismissed.
now,
had
the
plea
been
accepted
on
one
day
in
sentencing
schedule
for
several
weeks
later,
they
would
have
been
dismissed
there.
however,
the
important
fact
here
is
that
sentence
was
about
to
be
imposed
on
this
very
day
when
the
guilty
pleas
were
entered
and
on
this
very
day,
those
pleas
would
have
been
dismissed
under
ordinary
circumstances,
but
for
the
objection
of
the
government
that
they
wanted
this
defendant
held
and
not
sentenced
until
after
the
trial
of
a
co-defendant.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor.
i
can
only
answer
in
the
basis
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
automatically.
i'm
suggesting
that,
as
a
general
practice,
when
a
petitioner
pleads
to
a
lesser
number
of
counts
that
this
is
the
usual
arrangement
and
this
is
the
usual
purpose
of
the
plea,
that
there
are
cases
in
which
a
petitioner
pleads
because
he
does
not
want
to
face
trial
on
those
counts.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
may
i
suggest,
your
honor,
that
the
counts
in
this
case
show
that
this
case
falls
within
the
type
where
you
suggest
this
is
the
purpose,
namely
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
count
and
one
substantive
count
of
sale
and
the
remaining
counts
were
to
be
dismissed
with
three
further
acts
of
sale.
they
were
all
sales
to
the
same
government
agent
in
--
under
the
same
conspiracy.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
one
conspiracy
and
one
of
the
th--
one
of
the
four
substantive.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
in
any
event,
i
think
there
was
no
doubt
that
this
--
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
purpose
of
the
plea
in
the
understanding
of
all
the
parties
was
that
there
would
be
a
dismissal
of
the
remaining
three
counts
and
that
there
was
never
any
intention
to
have
a
trial
on
the
other
three.
and,
there
are
numerous
indications
in
the
record,
such
as
the
fact
that
he
was
scheduled
for
sentencing
before
judge
hall,
not
for
trial,
that
at
several
points
in
the
record,
it
says
that
the
purpose
was
for
sentencing,
that
judge
hall
transferred
for
that
purpose.
that
when
judge
hall
asked
what
the
purpose
of
having
the
petitioner
there
for,
the
response
given
by
the
clerk
or
by
the
us
attorney
was
“he
is
here
for
his
sentencing.”
that,
as
i
started
to
explain
before,
that
the
united
states
attorney
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
delay
sentence
because
he
wanted
to
hold
these
two
counts
in
abeyance,
the
sentence
on
these
counts
in
order
to
ensure
the
testimony
at
the
trial
that
had
there
been
any
intent
to
continue
the
trial
with
3,
4,
and
5,
holding
those
counts
would
have
been
sufficient.
but,
he
felt
it
was
necessary
to
delay
the
sentence
because
those
were
the
only
two
counts
on
which
the
government
ever
had
any
intention
of
continuing
the
prosecution
and
that
in
the
arrangement
which
was
sanctioned
by
judge
clark
when
he
accepted
the
pleas,
that
this
was
a
disposition
of
this
entire
crime
and
was
always
intended
to
be
a
disposition
and
i
don't
think
that
the
government
now
denies
that
that
was
intended
to
be
a
disposition.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
i
contend
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes
your
honor,
this
--
the
acceptance
of
the
plea
on
counts
1
and
2
amounts
to
a
conviction.
a
plea
of
guilty
accepted
by
the
court
is
a
conviction
just
like
a
verdict
of
the
jury.
the
--
there
are
--
the
kercheval
case
of
this
court
says
that
a
conviction
by
the
--
that
the
plea
is
the
conviction.
this
is,
in
all
respects,
like
a
jury
verdict.
the
man
is
convicted.
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
court
to
do
but
to
sentence
him.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
very
well,
your
honor.
there
--
we
have
different
problems
with
count
3,
4,
and
5.
now,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
would
he
have
that
power
to
vacate
the
plea
on
counts
1
and
2?
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
we
do
not
believe
that
he
would
have
had
the
power
to
vacate
the
pleas
sua
sponte.
in
the
first
place,
we
think
that
this
is
a
conviction
which
cannot
be
vacated
except
upon
motion
of
the
defendant.
now,
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
in
the
case
of
smith
versus
the
united
states
which
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief
and
in
our
reply
briefs,
this
court
said,
with
respect
to
a
question
whether
a
trial
court
could
vacate
a
trial,
could
--
in
other
words,
could
sua
sponte
grant
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
after
the
time
at
which
the
defendant
could
have
moved
for
a
new
trial?
this
court
said
that
it
would
not
reach
the
question
whether
the
court's
power
extended
beyond
the
defendant's
power
because
to
do
so
would
raise
a
serious
question
with
respect
to
double
jeopardy
and
that
this
question
should
be
avoided.
and,
they
said
that
the
reason
that
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
exists
is
because
what
avoids
double
jeopardy
is
the
fact
of
the
defendant's
motion,
that
--
and
we
feel
that
this
same
principle
is
applicable
here.
now,
the
--
historically,
we
feel
there
has
never
been
any
power
to
vacate
pleas
of
guilty.
we've
seen
those
citations
and
no
authority
in
which
this
power
exists.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
we
feel
that,
in
the
first
place,
there
are
several
things
involved
here.
perhaps
the
place
to
start
is
where
the
government
starts.
the
government
suggests
in
its
brief,
at
page
31,
that
even
if
all
the
legal
issues
were
decided
in
their
favor,
there
is
a
question
whether,
under
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court,
this
court
should
enforce
the
word
of
the
district
court
in
order
to
uphold
the
principles
of
administration
of
the
court.
there's
a
case
in
the
circuit
court,
the
franco
case
cited
in
our
briefs,
where
a
judge
announced
an
intention
to
dispo
--
to
give
a
particular
sentence
and
the
circuit
court
said
even
to
the
most
venial
of
its
subjects,
the
word
of
the
court
must
be
kept.
now,
the
word
of
the
court
here
includes
not
only
counts
1
and
2,
but
counts
3,
4,
and
5.
the
question
is
vacating
an
entire
disposition.
the
counts
--
the
guilty
pleas
on
1
and
2
cannot
be
separated
from
the
dismissals
on
3,
4,
and
5.
this
is
one
integrated
settlement
of
a
case
and,
if
you
decide
or
if
this
court
decides
that
1
and
2
can
be
vacated
properly,
then
there's
no
problem
with
3,
4,
and
5,
but
you
cannot
separate
3,
4,
and
5
from
1
and
2.
this
was
a
solution,
a
disposition,
and
a
judicially
approved
agreement
of
an
entire
matter.
and,
as
the
government
also
suggests,
it
would
be
unfair
to
try
this
man
on
counts
3,
4,
and
5
while
keeping
his
guilty
pleas
on
count
1
and
2.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
now,
to
return
to
justice
whittaker's
question
about
--
what
about
3,
4,
and
5,
as
i've
started
to
answer,
we,
first,
believe
that,
in
any
event
under
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court,
3,
4,
and
5
should
not,
under
any
circumstances,
be
tried
because
it
repudiates
the
good
faith
and
good
word
of
the
district
court.
secondly,
we
think
that
the
failure
to
dismiss
in
--
on
a
written
form
that
this
is
a
technical
objection
to
which
the
answer
is
that
it
was
tantamount
to
a
dismissal,
that
there
was
everything
done
by
the
formal
entry
of
the
dismissal.
thirdly,
we
say
that
this,
again,
raises
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
on
counts
3,
4,
and
5.
now,
here,
i
would
like
to
explain
in
per
--
possibly
partly
in
view
of
some
of
the
previous
opinions
we've
heard
today.
what
our
point
here
is
--
relates
to
breaking
the
prosecution
into
two
separate
parts.
we
do
not
contend
that
petitioner
could
not
have
been
tried
on
all
five
counts
at
one
proceeding.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
if
a
guilty
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
if
a
guilty
verdict
had
been
brought
in
on
all
five
counts,
he
could
have
received
separate
consecutive
sentences
in
20
years
and
he
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
consecutive
sentences--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
on
each
count.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
part
of
the
same
statute,
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
on
all
five
counts,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
the
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
he
was
acquitted
on
count
1
because
the
government
failed
to
prove
the
conspiracy
because
the
co-defendant
had
fled
to
mexico.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
he
was
convicted
on
count
2.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
we
were
hurt
by
the
fact
that
there
was
a
trial
at
all.
we
feel
that
there
was
a
disposition
of
this
case
by
plea.
this
was
a
disposition
under
which
a
man
was
convicted
and
a
conviction
which
cannot
just
be
vacated
just
as
the
government
or
the
court
could
not
vacate
a
conviction
after
trial
merely
because
it
might
be
better
to
try
the
man
over
again
under
a
different
theory
or
where
there
could
be
a
greater
penalty
imposed.
once
a
man
is
convicted,
he
is
convicted
whether
by
plea
or
by
verdict,
and
we
feel
we
were
prejudiced
by
being
subjected
to
a
second
trial
following
the
conviction.
when
i
say
second
trial,
i
mean
a
trial
following
a
conviction.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
that
it
was
a
dismissal
in
--
that
this
was
the
intent
of
the
parties
and
that
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
is
an
impo
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
now,
beyond
that
point,
beyond
that
point,
we
say
that,
in
fairness,
it
must
be
treated
as
such
and,
furthermore,
that
if
it
is
not
treated
as
such,
it
raises
serious
questions
with
respect
to
separation
of
the
trial
and
the
fairness.
the
government
concedes
it
would
be
unfair
to
try
him
separately
on
3,
4,
and
5
after
having
accepted
the
convictions
on
1
and
2.
the
government,
in
its
brief,
says
that
it's
necessary
to
vacate
1
and
2
out
of
fairness
to
the
defendant
because
he
would
have
been
prejudiced
on
his
trial
on
3,
4,
and
5.
now
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
i
--
furthermore,
we
rely
here
on
the
concept
that
not
only
in
the
single
indictment
must
these
offenses
be
tried,
but
that
they
must
be
tried
at
a
single
time
that
an
indictment
cannot
be
brought
forth
charging
a
number
of
offenses,
some
tried
separately
and
some
tried
by
plea
and
then
some
by
trial,
unless
this
is
the
express
understanding
at
the
time
of
the
entrance
of
the
pleas.
that
here,
in
effect,
there
were
two
prosecutions.
there
was
a
prosecution
by
plea
of
guilty
and
then,
further,
there
was
a
separate
prosecution
by
trial.
that,
the
rule
here
that
should
be
applied
is
the
rule
set
forth
in
the
model
penal
code
and
the
rule
that
suggested,
in
effect,
in
the
separate
opinion
in
the
abertay
case
in
which
it
was
suggested
that,
although
separate
offenses
may
be
tried
and
separate
punishments
may
be
imposed
for
separate
offenses
at
one
trial,
that
these
separate
--
that
these
offenses
may
not
be
separated
for
a
trial,
that
this
subjects
the
defendant
to
the
harassment
of
successive
trials
under
the
green
case.
that
it's
not
the
fact
that
all
of
these
things
couldn't
be
tried
in
one
indictment,
but
that
they
could
not
be
separated
by
the
government
which
would
take
pleas
on
one
and
then
try
them
on
the
others.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
the
sentences
which
were
finally
imposed
cumulated
20
years.
it,
in
effect,
was
--
there
was
10
years
on
count
5,
5
on
4,
5
on
3,
and
5
concurrent
on
2.
and
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
originally
tried
to
put
him
on
probation
on
2
and
that
was
corrected
due
to
our
--
the
intervention
suggesting
that
it
should
be
corrected.
but,
in
effect,
the
petitioner
was,
in
this
case,
subjected
to
a
quadruple
sentence
over
that
which
had
been
announced
by
the
court
originally
over
that
and
with
which
he
had
left
the
courtroom,
spent
a
month
in
jail
being
held
in
jail,
again,
without
credit.
and,
in
answer
to
the
earlier
question,
we
concede
that
in
this
case,
when
he
was
eventually
sentenced
to
20
years,
he
was
given
no
credit.
there
was
no
retroactive
sentence.
so,
he
was
–
he
left
the
courtroom,
spent
a
month
in
jail
under
the
impression
that
he
was
--
had
been
promised
and
that
it
had
been
announced
to
five-year
sentence,
then
because
of
the
delay
requested
by
the
government
to
ensure
what
his
testimony
would
be
at
another
trial,
he
was
subsequently
transferred
sua
sponte
by
judge
hall
and
then
submitted
--
subjected
to
a
trial
and
convicted
for
a
period
of
20
years.
and,
we
believe
with
the
government
that,
aside
from
the
legal
issues
involved
in
this
case,
a
serious
question
arises
under
the
ad
--
supervisory
power
of
the
court
and
not
just,
as
the
government
suggests,
is
that
the
fact
of
a
quadruple
sentence
that
requires
the
exercise
of
this
power,
but
it's
the
fact
of
a
quadruple
sentence
resulting
from,
one,
the
postponement
for
an
improper
purpose,
two,
the
vacation
of
a
plea
that
had
been
adopted
and
accepted
by
the
court
and
the
subjection
of
a
man
to
trial
for
absolutely
no
reason.
there
was
no
justification
for
the
trial
at
all.
that,
in
view
of
all
of
these
factors
that,
certainly,
this
court
under
its
supervisory
power,
should
try
to
extricate
this
man
from
the
quadruple
sentence
imposed
because
one
judge
suspected
the
actions
and
motives
of
another
united
states
district
judge.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
the--
our
first
suggestion
with
respect
to
both
the
sentencing
questions
and
the
double
jeopardy
questions
is
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
complete
release.
under
the
sentencing
section,
we
believe
that
there
was
an
unreasonable
delay
in
sentencing.
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
this,
but
i
think
our
briefs
do
adequately.
the
--
we
believe
there
was
an
improper
delay
in
sentencing.
this
comes
under
rule
32
and
the
sixth
amendment.
and,
that
due
to
the
improper
delay
and
the
deprivation
of
a
speedy
trial
because
of
the
purpose
here,
and
this
is
what
makes
it
improper,
the
purpose
of
the
delay
that
he
cannot
be
tried
at
all
and
he
should
be
released,
barring
that,
however,
our
next
suggestion
is
that
he
should
at
least
be
relieved
of
all
prejudice
resulting
from
this
unlawful
delay
in
sentencing.
in
other
words,
he
should
be
returned
to
where
he
would
have
been
had
this
delay
not
occurred.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
which
means
five
years,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
as
i
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
fair.
it
is
less
than
a
constitutional
requirement.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
that
is
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
this
was,
in
effect,
the
tom
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
i
--
the
reason
i
hesitate
to
answer
this
is
because
if
you
are
distinguishing
this
case
in
which
the
announcement
came
at
the
moment
of
the
sentence,
it
was
merely
a
couple
of
words
before,
he
was
about
to
impose
sentence.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
then,
there
is
no
problem.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
but,
the
problem
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
it's
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
i
would
say
that
und
--
in
a
case
--
in
an
ordinary
case,
there
is
no
reason
or
no
justification
for
a
court
announcing
sentence
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
i
would
perhaps
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
there's
a
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
well,
i
am
somewhat
at
a
loss
to
answer
because
i
don't
know
what
circumstances
your
honor
really
has
in
mind.
i
would
say,
as
a
gener
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
let
me
say
this.
if
a
trial
judge
intends
to
get
a
parole
report,
he
should
not
announce
his
sentence
in
advance
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
required.
that
is
only
permissive
under
the
rules.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
perhaps
the
solution
might
be
that
the
requirement
should
be
mandatory
that
trial
judges
should
be
required
to
get
these
reports.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
the
courts
in
--
this
is
really
up
to
the
court.
the
court
indicated
it
did
not
want
one
and
the
waiver
was
just
agreement
with
it.
i
said
that
we
had
no
objection.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
the
word
“waiver”
was
used,
but
this
was
not
actually
the
act
that
avoided
the
report.
the
act
was
the
trial
judge
saying
we
don't
need
it.
and,
the
reason
that,
again
is
obvious
is
the
severity
of
the
sentences
here.
he
knew
he
had
a
mandatory
minimum
of
five
years
and
he
was
satisfied
that
a
mandatory
minimum
of
five
years
is
a
substantial
sentence
and
he
saw
no
reason
to
get
a
probation
report.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
such
rule.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor.
the
word
“wavier”
was
just
an
affirmation
of
agreement
with
the
court's
action
and
not
requiring
a
probation
report.
the
word
“waiver”
is
really
not
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
not
the
correct
word.
the
word
“waiver”
appears
in
the
record.
when
the
judge
said
that
he
would
not
get
a
probation
report,
i
just
said
“fine,
we'll
waive
any
such
report,”
meaning,
that
if
there
were
any
kind
of
requirement,
which
there
isn't
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
i
have
my
co-counsel
here
who
will
continue
with
the
trial
errors.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
very
little
i
can
see
to
improve
on
the
solicitor
general's
arguments.
and
in
a
large
measure,
we
agree
with
--
with
many
of
them.
if
the
court
does
not
find
that
the
sentence
of
petitioner
is
totally
barred
by
the
circumstances
of
delay
in
trial
and
by
the
double
jeopardy
arguments
and
the
other
issues
raised
in
our
brief,
we
agree
that
the
five-year
sentence
imposed
on
count
2
should
be
affirmed
so
long
as
the
sentences
on
counts
3,
4
and
5
are
dismissed
and
that
this
would
be
an
orderly
method
for
disposing
of
this.
this
is
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
the
basis
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
just
do
it
without
an
opinion.
i
think
that
our
briefs
and
arguments
suggest
numerous
basis,
including
the
supervisory
power,
as
well
as
double
jeopardy
which
may
well
be
applied
if
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
question,
as
well
as
an
abusive
discretion
on
the
lack
of
power.
now,
as
far
as
a
vacation
of
the
pleas
on
1
and
2
and
ordering
the
defendant
to
trial,
i
think
that
when
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asks
what
is
the
abusive
discretion
in
this
case,
that
is
clearly
where
we
found
it.
when
judge
hall
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
that's
clearly
where
we
--
where
we
find
that
abusive
discretion.
i
--
i
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
that
it
is
found
in
other
places.
but
i
think
in
this
instance,
it
is
clear.
the
judge
did
--
judge
hall
did
not
just
say
“well,
we'll
proceed
on
the
trial
with
counts
3,
4
and
5.”
what
he
did
was
vacate
an
entire
disposition.
he
said,
“let's
vacate
the
pleas
on
count
1
and
2
and
send
you
to
trial.”
this,
he
considered
necessary
to
the
trial,
not
just
a
trial
which
could
take
place,
but
he
felt
it
necessary
to
vacate
the
previous
disposition
which
he
believed
judge
clark
to
have
made,
and
he
vacated
that
entire
disposition.
we
don't
believe
there's
any
such
power.
if
there
is
a
power,
we
urge
this
is
certainly
an
abuse
of
discretion.
the
grounds
he
gave
for
this
do
not
justify
any
such
vacation
that
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
your
honor,
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
power
to
vacate
a
conviction.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
if
we
consent
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
--
certainly.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
if
it
were
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
your
honor,
if
it
were
in
the
interest
of
the
defendant,
he
would
not
have
the
problem
of
having
to
do
it
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant.
this
--
this
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor.
when
a
man
is
convicted,
he
may
remove
the
prejudice
of
--
of
being
submitted
to
trial
again
if
it's
in
his
interest
by
waiving
any
--
any
right
to
that
conviction.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
your
honor,
i
--
we
are
suggesting
that
there
is
no
power
but
--
but
clearly,
it
is
an
abusive
discretion.
the
grounds
given
in
this
case
accusing
the
other
judge
of
having
entered
into
a
deal
or
the
appearance
of
a
deal,
certainly,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
accusation
of
a
deal.
as
to
the
appearance
of
a
deal,
we
do
not
believe
there's
any
--
this
is
a
circumstance
which
warrants
a
vacation
to
the
prejudice
of
a
defendant.
and
let
--
and
let
me
just
make
clear
that
judge
hall
was
not
the
chief
judge
of
the
district
at
the
time.
mr.
cox
inadvertently
suggested
that
he
was
and
that
this
might
have
given
him
some
inference
in
the
sentence.
it
was
judge
yankwich
at
the
time.
but
the
--
the
purpose
is
--
the
purpose
was
to
--
to
permit
the
increase
in
sentence.
this
was
the
reason
for
the
vacation.
this
was
the
reason
that
he
want
--
sent
him
to
trial
on
all
five
counts.
it
was
in
order
to
increase
this
sentence
and
for
that
reason,
we
do
feel
that
this
be
--
the
sentence
becomes
a
part
of
this
problem.
now,
as
to
the
question
of
why
there
was
no
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor
pointed
out
that
on
counts
3,
4
and
5,
all
that
was
said
was
“hold
those”.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
thank
you.
it
--
it
is
true
that
there
was
no
motion
made.
and
that
--
that
the
question
involves
interpretation
of
the
word
--
words
“hold
those.”
as
your
honor
suggested,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
those
words
could
not
have
meant
anything
other
than
that
those
were
to
be
dismissed
at
the
time
of
trial.
they
--
i
--
i
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
i
agree
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
--
i
agree
with
your
honor.
it
could
have
been
made
clear
if
there
was
a
necessity,
and
perhaps
there
was.
perhaps
it
should
have
been
made
clear
that
those
were
held
for
a
dismissal.
but
in
the
district
courts,
to
my
understanding,
that
is
what
--
what
happens
when
counsel
held
for
dismissal
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
if
they
were
to
be
tried,
they
would
have
been
set
for
trial.
there
was
no
--
nobody
ever
thought
they
were
set
for
trial.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor,
not
another
proceeding.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor.
let
me
explain
this.
if
they
are
--
there's
not
a
separate
proceeding.
they
are
dismissed
when
sentence
is
imposed.
the
judge
says
“count
1,
5
years,
count
2,
5
years,
count
3,
4,
and
5,
dismissed.”
it
is
the
sentencing
proceedings
at
which
formal
dismissal
takes
place.
and
that's
why
they
say
“hold
those.”
they
don't
dismiss
part
of
the
judgment
apart
from
the
sentence.
they
are
all
dismissed
as
part
of
one
judgment,
so
that
it
was
the
formal
dismissal
which
was
delayed
by
the
words
“hold
those”.
it
was
necessary
to
do
that
until
the
time
of
sentence
when
one
judgment
would
be
entered.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
the
word
“judgment”,
i
--
i
cannot
say
that
it
constituted
a
judgment.
i
can
say
it
constituted
a
disposition
of
the
case.
it
constituted
a
court-approved
settlement
that
the
guilty
plea
situation
and
--
somewhere
over
80%
of
the
cases
in
the
trial
court
are
disposed
of
by
guilty
pleas.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
binding
and
it
is
the
action
of
the
court,
just
as
a
jury
verdict
is
binding
without
a
judgment.
the
--
the
defendant
has
been
convicted
upon
acceptance
of
his
plea
of
guilty.
he
cannot
withdraw,
except
with
permission
of
the
court.
the
court
can
and
should
impose
sentence
upon
that
--
upon
that
plea
and
that
he's
--
he's
removed
his
discretion.
he
--
he
is
subject
to
imprisonment
upon
that
plea
and
he
--
he
cannot
just
change
his
plea
when
he
wishes.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
and
your
honor,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
trying
to
evade
that
it's
only
the
use
of
the
word
“judgment”
that
bothers
me.
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you
by
suggesting
that
we
consider
this
a
judgment.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
a
disp
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
thank
you
very
much.
[laughter]
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
sir?
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
court-approved
settlement
means
on
the
number
of
counts.
this
is
the
way
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
--
this
is
the
way
guilty
pleas
are
entered
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
the
court
approves
the
settlement
of
two
counts
in
lieu
of
a
trial
on
all
five.
the
court
--
that
is
the
court
approval
of
the
disposition.
the
court
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
your
honor.
let
me
just
--
just
say
that
there
was
--
i
want
--
in
case
there's
any
doubt
in
the
--
in
your
honor's
mind
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
the
--
the
appearance,
we
would
suggest,
only
does
--
if
there
is
such
an
appearance,
which
i
wish
we
had
time
to
--
there
is
--
there
is
no
such
appearance.
i'm
sorry
to
differ
with
your
honor.
but
we
don't
believe
there
is.
but
furthermore,
that
would
not
justify
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
--
vacating
a
conviction
and
we've
considered
this
was
a
conviction.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes,
your
--
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
--
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
improper.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
i
would
think
so.
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
such
practice.
and
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
proper
practice
is
for
the
defendant
and
the
united
states
attorney,
the
two
attorneys,
to
agree
on
the
number
of
counts
which
is
satisfactory
and
then
an
open
court,
to
go
in
and
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
to
--
well,
i
think
it
would
be
improper
because
the
court
is
not
bound
by
the
u.s.
attorney's
view
as
to
sentence
and
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
no,
no,
but
if
--
if
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
but
your
honor,
if
the
plea
were
based
on
any
promises
to
sentence,
i
would
think
that
it
--
that
it
would
be
improper
because
you
would
then
go
--
into
court
and
the
judge
might
change
the
sentence.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
well,
in
that
--
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
i
just
--
i
just
want
to
add
one
fact,
your
honor,
to
--
to
refute
any
implication
there
might
be
of
impropriety
here,
as
far
as
the
two
judges,
that
this
case
was
put
back
on
the
calendar
before
judge
clark
by
the
united
states
attorney.
this
was
no
effort
by
the
defendant
to
--
to
do
that.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
yes.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
bernhard.
mr.
stephen
r.
reinhardt
thank
you
very
much.
