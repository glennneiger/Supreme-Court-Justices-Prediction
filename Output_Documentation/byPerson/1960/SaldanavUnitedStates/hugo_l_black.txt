(inaudible)
both
counts
separately?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
the
request
directed
to
that
particular
count?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
this
court
ever
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
a
district

has
power
to
compel
a
man
to
withdraw
his
plea
of
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the

to
have

you
mind,
mr.

just
stating

you
can,
in
which
the

reference
to
this
sale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
what
--
what
could
they
find
from
the
evidence
that
they
had
to
find?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
know
--
i
want
to
know
just
what
it
was
that
was
done
under
the
evidence
as
you
see
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
brought
about
the
sale.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
for
the
performance
of
the
executory
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
he
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
do?
what
did
each
one
do?
justice

l.
black
then
what
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
drew
his
gun?
justice

l.
black
he

hand.
the
agent
drew
his
gun
on
him.
had
the
agent
paid
anything
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
these
--
these
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
time
they
could
find
it,
it
was
on
credit
up
to
that
point
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
officer
had
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
ahead.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this,
instead
of
being
an
officer,
had
been
a
robber?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
this
officer,
instead
of
being
an
officer,
had
been
a
robber,
and
he
saw
his
chance
now
to
get
this
heroin
without
paying
for
it
and
he
just
held
up
his
gun
and
said,
“give
it
to
me.”
would
that
have
been
a
completed
sale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
if
the
merchant
picks
out
something
and
says
“this
is
it”
and
puts
it
over
one
side,
would
that
be
a
completed
sale?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
i
go
down
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
go
down
--
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
i
go
down
and
order
some
steaks
and
i
leave
to
go
home
and
they
cut
them
and
they
put
them
aside
there,
i'm
already
--
those
steaks
are
already
sold
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
i
got
the
paper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
i
haven't
seen
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i
wouldn't
like
them
when
i
see
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
--
this
man
though
hadn't
seen
this
error.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
just
pulled
a
sack.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
--
is
it
extra
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
it
extraordinary?
i'm
--
i'm
not
(inaudible)
this
information,
the
prosecuting
attorney
and
the
defendant
lawyers
get
together,
go
to
the
judge,
and
say
“now,
we
are
willing
to
satisfy
--
settle
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
plea
of
guilty
with
a
sentence
that's
so
light."
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
ever
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it's
improper.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
--
i'm
talking
about
an
open
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
be
bound
by
the
agreement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
be
bound
by
the
agreement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
a
lot
of
impropriety
is
committed
in
this
country.
