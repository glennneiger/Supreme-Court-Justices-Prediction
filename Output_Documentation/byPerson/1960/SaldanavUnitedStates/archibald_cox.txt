mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
which
has
given
me
very
grave
concern.
i
find
it
a
difficult
and
troublesome
case
because
it
seems
to
turn
on
a
delicate
question
of
judicial
administration,
including
two
district
judges,
one,
the
chief
judge
of
his
district,
on
questions
which
certainly
affect
confidence
in
the
fairness
and
rationality
of
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
we
think,
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
start,
that
the
case
may
well
call
for
some
modification
of
the
judgment
below
under
--
in
an
exercise
of
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court.
but,
at
the
same
time,
our
view
of
the
case
is
quite
different
from
that
expressed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
i
can
summarize
the
government's
position
best
in
three
propositions.
first,
it
seems
to
us
that
each
of
the
rulings
in
the
district
court
viewed
by
itself
whether
before
a
trial,
during
the
trial,
or
upon
sentencing
was
well
within
the
power
of
the
court.
and
that,
indeed,
none
of
the
rulings
inv
--
looked
at
by
themselves
involved
any
error
of
law
and
i
will
tell
in
a
few
instances,
the
questions
may
be
closer.
we
also
think
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
involved
in
any
single
ruling.
our
trouble
comes,
second,
when
we
look
at
the
case
as
a
whole.
it
seems
to
me
--
it
seems
to
us
that
there
was
much
more
doubt
about
the
net
effect
of
all
the
rulings
and
if
viewed
as
a
whole,
beginning
with
judge
clark's
promise
of
a
5-year-sentence
and
ending
with
judge
hall's
imposition
of
a
20-year-sentence,
the
proceeding
may
not
meet
those
standards
of
fairness
and
rationality
which
ought
to
characterize
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
third,
we
point
out
that
the
difficulties
arose
from
differences
in
sentencing
practice
and
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
calendar
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california,
a
matter,
which
i
will
point
out
later,
has
now
been
corrected.
they
are
not
mistakes,
if
they
were
mistakes,
which
resulted
from
the
government's
position
or,
indeed,
later
when
they
urged
upon
the
court
by
it.
under
these
circumstances,
we
think
that
our
function
is
discharged
when
we
disclose
the
problem
fairly
to
the
court
and
address
ourselves
to
the
considerations
on
either
side
because
we
do
think
that
there
are
considerations
on
either
side.
now,
in
the
course
of
my
argument,
i
want,
first,
to
talk
--
address
myself
to
the
general
cha
--
question
whether
the
character
of
the
proceeding
was
consistent
with
fairness
and
rationality,
and
i
postpone
for
the
moment
the
specific
questions
of
law
and
the
specific
questions
of
the
power
of
the
judge's
to
make
these
individual
rulings.
i
will
deal
with
them
at
the
close
of
the
argument.
we
can
best
approach
the
general
question
by
taking
a
bird's
eye
view
of
the
stream
of
events
even
though
this
does
involve
some
repetition
of
what's
already
been
said.
there
were
two
defendants,
palomino
and
saldana,
the
petitioner
here,
who
were
indicted
for
narcotics
violations
in
five
counts.
the
first
was
a
conspiracy
count
and
the
other
four
dealt
with
sales
of
narcotics,
each
coming
about
a
week
after
the
other.
on
june
16,
both
defendants
were
arraigned
before
judge
clark.
at
that
time,
we
get
the
first
intimation
of
one
of
the
causes
of
the
difficulty
in
this
case.
at
page
14
of
the
record,
you
will
find
that
palomino's
lawyer
was
very
anxious
to
keep
the
case
from
being
transferred
to
judge
hall's
calendar.
at
that
time,
judge
clark
was
in-charge
of
the
criminal
calendar
in
the
southern
district.
his
period
was
about
to
run
out
on
june
30
and
judge
hall
would
come
in
as
the
criminal
judge
beginning
jud
--
july
1
and
mr.
tener,
representing
palomino,
says
“your
honor,
may
i
also
be
heard
briefly
as
to
whether
this
matter
of
necessity
must
be
transferred
to
judge
hall.”
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
bar
in
that
area,
rightly
or
wrongly,
regards
judge
clark
as
lenient
in
narcotics
cases
and
judge
hall
as
being
a
good
deal
more
severe.
about
12
days
later,
on
june
26,
it
was
now
getting
close
to
june
30,
petitioner
came
in
with
his
counsel
before
judge
clark
and
pleaded
guilty
on
two
counts.
i
think
counsel
is
--
speaks
fairly
when
he
says
that
it
was
anticipated
that
if
the
plea
of
guilty
were
accepted
on
the
two
counts
that,
then,
the
remaining
counts
would
be
dismissed.
the
two
counts
might
cover
a
sentence
of
40
years
and
if
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty
to
those
two
counts,
there
was
really
no
need
from
anybody's
point
of
view
of
going
to
trial
on
the
remaining
counts
so
far
as
the
severity
of
the
sentence
might
be
concerned.
the
defendant
came
in
and
then
asked
for
immediate
sentence.
as
one
reads
the
record,
as
it
appears
on
page
16
and
17,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
defendant
must
have
carried
away
two
impressions,
one
that
he
would
be
sentenced
before
judge
clark
and,
second,
that
judge
clark
would
give
him
the
minimum
sentence
of
five
years
to
run
concurrently
on
each
of
the
first
two
counts.
i
think
it
might
also
be
said
now,
although
it
becomes
important
later,
that
it
is
fairly
plain
that
everyone
had
forgotten
about
counts
3,
4,
and
5.
if
you'll
note,
on
page
17
of
the
record,
they've
been
talking
about
counts
1
and
2.
then,
the
court
said
that
he
didn't
want
a
probation
report
because
he
was
going
to
give
the
minimum
anyway,
then,
there
was
--
counsel
said
“we
will
waive
the
probation
report.”
the
court,
“alright,”
a
short
intermission.
then,
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
suppose
that
it
was
for
a
broader
purpose
that
dealt
with
what
sentence
should
be
imposed
and
not
simply
whether
there
should
be
probation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
had
always
understood
that
to
be
so,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
effect,
what
happened
here
was
that
judge
clark
promised
the
minimum
sentence
without
finding
out
about
the
trial,
without
taking
into
account,
i
think,
the
very
large
quantity
of
narcotics
involved,
especially
in
the
final
sale,
and
without
looking
into
saldana's
background.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
would
be
no
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
there
would
be
no
sense
to
it
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
impose
the
minimum
sentence.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
was
simply
speaking
the
point
that
this
promise
was
made
without
a
very,
shall
i
say,
deep
investigation
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
the
par--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
rule,
of
course,
doesn't
speak
of
a
probation
report.
it
speaks
strictly
of
a
presentence
investigation
and
making
a
report
to
court.
so
that
this
is
a
colloquialism
in
either
event
and
i
think
you're
quite
right
that
judge
clark
was
thinking
of
it
as
showing
whether
this
man
deserved
probation.
the
point
i
was
seeking
to
make
was
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
so
far
as
counts
3,
4,
and
5
were
concerned,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
expectation
was
that
they
would
be
dismissed.
the
fact
is
that
apparently
the
district
judge
was
not
aware
of
them.
it
was
the
clerk
who
said,
as
counsel
were
about
to
leave
the
room,
“just
a
minute
mr.
sheraton,
mr.
saldana
is
charged
with
counts
3,
4,
and
5.”
that
was
the
first
time
they
were
mentioned
and,
the
disposition
was
hold
those.
there
was
clearly
no
ruling
about
that.
now,
at
this
point,
it's
necessary
for
me
to
leave
the
facts
of
this
case
for
a
moment
and
explain
the
practice
in
handling
criminal
cases
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
as
it
existed
at
the
time
of
this
case,
i'll
explain
the
changes
later,
it's
important
to
understand
what
it
was
at
the
time
of
this
case
now,
if
a
defendant
was
indicted
as
the
single
defendant
and
came
in,
before
he
was
arraigned,
before
the
judge
who
had
the
criminal
documents,
and
if
he
pleaded
guilty,
that
judge
would
then
pass
sentence
upon
him.
if
he
pleaded
not
guilty,
the
case
might
be
tried
by
the
judge
who
was
handling
the
criminal
document
or
it
might
be
sent
out
to
another
judge.
if
there
were
two
defendants
and
one
pleaded
guilty
and
the
other
was
to
be
tried,
then
the
practice
of
some
of
the
judges
in
the
southern
district
of
california
was
to
have
sentence
imposed
by
the
judge
who
conducted
the
trial
of
the
defendant
who
pleaded
not
guilty.
this
has
obvious
fairness
and
sense
in
it.
it
enables
the
man
who
passed
sentence
to
have
heard
something
about
the
trial.
it's
a
way
of
not
breaking
off
two
men
who
joined
together
in
defense
and
bringing
them
before
different
judges,
one
of
whom
would
almost
surely
pass
sentence
without
regard
to
what
might
be
done
by
the
other.
now,
district
judge
hall,
the
chief
judge
i
am
informed,
uniformly
followed
this
practice
that
when
the
case
was
sent
out
to
a
judge
to
try
it,
then
any
co-defendant
who
pleaded
guilty
went
out
with
the
judge
and,
of
course,
that's
reflected
in
what
happened
later.
that
was
not,
however,
the
practice
of
all
the
district
judges
in
the
southern
district
of
california
at
this
time
and
i
infer
that
it
was
not
judge
clark's
practice,
although
i
have
no
specific
knowledge
upon
that
point.
the
practice
was
reflected
when,
somewhat
later,
on
july
9,
we
find
a
minute
entry
transferring
saldana's
case
from
judge
clark's
docket
before
judge
hall
who
was
to
try
palomino,
the
co-defendant.
it
was
done
when
palomino's
counsel
came
in
and
asked
for
a
continuance.
judge
hall
apparently
noticed
that
it
was
a
co-defendant
and
said
“have
him
transferred
here.
when
i
take
a
case,
i
take
the
whole
case”
and
notify
his
counsel
accordingly
and
that
was
done.
then,
the
case
came
on,
after
continuances,
before
judge
hall
on
july
29.
this
quite
clearly
defeated
saldana's
expectation
that
he
would
be
sentenced
before
judge
clark.
it
also,
when
judge
hall
vacated
the
guilty
pleas
to
the
first
count
--
first
two
counts,
of
course
set
in
train
a
series
of
events
that
defeated
his
expectations
on
the
first
two
counts.
these
rulings
were
reaffirmed
on
august
1st
and
the
case
against
saldana,
palomino
having
jumped
bail,
came
on
for
trial
at
that
time.
i
think
it's
worth
noting
the
grounds
that
judge
hall
gave
for
his
action,
as
i
discern
them
from
pages
24
and
25
and
then
again
28
and
29
of
the
record
at
first
--
i'll
take
those
up
after
the
recess.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
the
recess,
i
had
called
attention
to
the
two
sessions
before
judge
peirson
hall
at
which
he
vacated
the
plea
of
guilty,
rejected
a
further
offer
to
plead
guilty
to
the
first
two
counts,
denied
a
motion
to
return
the
case
to
judge
clark,
and
then
put
the
petitioner
on
trial.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
would
quite
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
it's
--
while
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
petitioner
and
his
attorney
is
left
with
the
expectation
that
the
other
counts
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
--
well,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
--
i
was
going
on
to
say
that,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
did
judge
clark
--
there
was
no
motion
to
dismiss
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
a
fortiori,
judge
clark
did
not
grant
a
motion
to
dismiss
them.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
both
points.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
agree.
there
was
no
motion
and
certainly,
there
was
no
order
entered
which
could,
in
any
sense,
be
said
to
be
a
granting
of
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
would
--
i'm
going
to
answer
your
question
directly,
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
think,
to
give
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
meaningful
answer
that
i
must
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
come
at
it
a
little
--
mr.
archibald
cox
my
--
my
interpretation
is
this.
as
long
as
we
are
talking
about
the
expectations
that
were
generated
in
the
defendant's
mind
and
the
representations,
the
impressions
created
by
judge
clark,
then
the
only
conclusion
that
i
can
fairly
come
to
is
that
the
defendant
went
away
expecting
that
on
july
21,
he
would
be
brought
before
judge
clark
and
would
be
sentenced
to
five
years
and
that
these
counts
would
be
dismissed.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
that
was
undoubtedly
the
impression
of
the
united
states
attorney.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that's
some
confirmation.
the
point
at
which
i
would
agree
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
and
possibly,
disagree
with
the
implication
of
what
chief
justice
said
would
be
this.
a
court,
as
justice
frankfurter
implies,
acts
through
orders
and
decrees.
when
it's
passing
sentence,
the
judge
passes
sentence.
but
as
soon
as
we
begin
talking
about
what
the
court
did
here
and
not
about
impressions
people
could
go
away
with,
then,
it
seems
to
me
plain
that
there
was
no
motion
and
that
the
court
clearly
did
not
enter
an
order
dismissing
these
counts
and
that
nothing
the
court
said
could
reasonably
be
interpreted
as
an
order
dismissing
this
count.
now,
this
goes
to
the
essential
difference,
i
think,
between
my
approach
to
the
case
and
the
position
which
has
been
argued
by
the
petitioners
and
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
archibald
cox
when
--
when
we
come
to
the
orders,
as
i
was
saying,
i
think
it's
clear
that
no
order
was
passed
dismissing
these
counts.
i
think
a
misimpression
was
created.
now,
here
is
where
i
part
company
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner.
their
contention,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
promise
--
and
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
the
promise
made
by
judge
clark
is
binding
and
must
have
been
honored
no
matter
what
other
circumstances
existed.
i
reject
that.
i
think
that's
attempting
to
read
into
the
constitution.
what
may
be
the
appeal
of
a
particular
and
rather
extraordinary
case,
i
think,
as
i
shall
argue
later,
that
there
are
no
such
rules
as
he
relies
it.
on
the
other
hand,
when
i
first
came
to
this
case,
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
situation
here
which
certainly
must
have
left
a
deep
resentment
in
the
petitioner
and
which
another
detached,
fair-minded
person
could
say,
“this
is
bad
for
the
administration
of
justice.”
this,
in
the
words
justice
frankfurter
used
this
morning,
is
unseemly
and
if
this
happened
very
often,
it
would
destroy
confidence
in
the
fairness
and
rationality
of
justice
in
our
courts.
now,
i
think
that
involves
an
overall
view
of
what
happened
and
particularly,
a
view
of
what
happened
in
terms
of
the
final
sentence
imposed.
furthermore,
i
don't
think
that
the
question
is
all
one-sided.
let
me
state
first,
the
points
which
bother
me
about
the
trial
taken
as
a
whole
and
then
the
points
on
the
other
side
because
i
think
there
are
some
on
the
other
side.
the
points
that
bother
me
are,
first,
that
in
any
instance,
wide
divergence
in
sentences
tends
to
undermine
confidence
by
making
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
appear
on
part
to
depend
on
the
whim
or
caprice
of
the
individual
judge.
and
that
danger
is
certainly
much
greater
when
you
get
a
wide
divergence
in
sentencing,
the
same
man
on
the
same
indictment
by
two
different
judges.
it
makes
it
look
as
if
it
all
depended
on
who
you
came
before
and
this
is
not
good
for
the
courts.
and
third,
here,
that
even
though
i
feel
that
this
representation
ought
not
to
have
been
made,
i
say
that
with
some
diffidence
about
the
district
judge
but
i
do
not
think
it
was
consistent
with
good
practice,
the
representation
that
he
would,
someday,
impose
a
light
sentence.
still,
it
was
made
and
there
is,
as
with
all
of
us,
if
the
court
--
the
law
does
not
keep
its
promises,
this,
too,
tends
to
throw
some
doubt
upon
the
integrity
of
the
whole
proceeding.
now,
if
that
were
all,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
be
here.
if
judge
clark
--
if
judge
hall,
on
having
the
case
come
before
him,
had
said
to
the
defendant,
“i
do
not
feel
bound
by
this
promise
made
by
judge
clark,
the
courts
don't
make
promises,
the
courts
act
through
orders.
and
i
feel
that
this
was
an
unwise
expression
of
opinion
made
without
study
of
your
record,
made
without
learning
about
the
crime,
made
without
an
investigation
in
the
sentence.
i
will
give
you
--
i'm
not
going
to
be
bound
by
it.
now,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
i'm
not
going
to
be
bound
by
it,
i
will
give
you
an
opportunity
to
withdraw
your
plea.
you
can
stand
on
your
plea
if
you
wish.
if
you
do,
you
do
it
with
full
awareness
that
i
am
going
to
pass
sentence
here
after
an
investigation
of
the
facts.
if
you
wish
to
withdraw
your
plea,
i'll
permit
you
to
withdraw
it
and
give
you
leave
to
stand
trial.”
in
that
case,
i
say,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
be
taking
the
position
i
do.
the
thing
that
bothers
me
the
most
about
this
case
is
that
the
sequence
of
events
in
which
it
took
place
makes
the
whole
thing
look
like
an
elaborate
ritual
for
going
behind
the
representations
made
by
judge
clark.
and
i
think
that
that
does
a
great
threat,
a
greater
amount
of
erosion
of
confidence
in
the
proceeding.
then,
if
the
judge
had
simply
squarely
said,
“this
shouldn't
have
happened.
i'm
not
going
to
be
bound
by
it,”
but
instead,
he
forced
the
defendant
to
trial
without
much
of
any
explanation
and
then,
after
trying
him,
imposed
the
20-year
sentence,
four
times
that
originally
imposed.
and
it
is
the
feeling
i
get
that,
i
can't
think
of
any
better
way
to
put
it
and
yet,
i'm
not
happy
with
the
way
i
phrased
it,
that
it
became
sort
of
a
mock
proceeding
for
the
preordained
purpose
of
quadrupling
the
sentence
without
any
square
acknowledgment
of
the
problem.
that
troubles
me
most
deeply.
now,
even
as
i
say
that,
i
do
feel
obliged
to
say
that
there
is
a
good
deal
that
can
be
said
here
in
defense
of
judge
hall's
action
once
we
acknowledge
that
he
was,
perhaps,
a
little
abrupt.
in
the
first
place,
as
has
been
pointed
out
already,
the
representations
about
the
five-year
sentence
were
made,
apparently,
without
any
real
investigation
of
the
case
or
of
the
man's
previous
record.
actually,
this
involves
a
very
large
quantity
of
heroin.
the
fifth
count
alleged
in
the
evidence
later
shown
that
there
were
10
ounces.
10
ounces,
allowing
for
an
average
addict,
would
keep
50
addicts
satisfied
or
happy
for
a
month.
that's
quite
a
lot
of
heroin.
and
a
--
the
minimum
sentence
for
that
quantity
of
heroin
is
getting
off
lighter
than
the
average
sentence,
which
sentence
is
being
imposed
rightly
or
wrongly
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
in
addition,
this
was
an
instance
where
saldana
received
the
lighter
sentence
by
virtue
of
rushing
in
to
plead
before
judge
clark
who,
i'm
informed,
does
have
the
reputation
of
being
lenient.
again,
surely,
there's
much
to
be
said
in
defense
of
judge
hall's
position
that
the
whole
case
should
be
handled
by
a
single
judge,
and
he
was
insisting
on
following
that
practice.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing,
no.
the
--
palomino's
counsel
had
gone
in
judge
--
before
judge
hall
on
a
motion
for
a
continuance
and
at
that,
it
was
to
suit
his
convenience
and
neither
judge
hall
nor
anyone
else
knew
whether
palomino
had
flown
the
coop
or
not.
so,
i
suppose,
in
saying
that
he
hadn't,
i'm
not
quite
accurate.
but
in
any
event,
not
everybody
knew
it.
and
it
came
out
only
later
on
the
day
that
he
was
--
the
next
hearing
before
judge
hall.
mr.
archibald
cox
at
the
time
he
ordered
the
case
transferred
to
him,
he
thought
that
one
defendant
was
going
to
be
tried
before
him
and
that
the
other,
saldana,
should
be
brought
before
him
for
sentencing.
at
the
time
he
vacated
the
pleas
of
guilty,
it
was
known
that
palomino
had
flown
the
coop.
how
soon
they
would
catch
him
was
not
known,
but
the
qualification
your
honor
states
should
be
added
to
my
sentence.
i
--
but
in
a
sense,
judge
hall
was
asserting
the
practice
here
that
when
one
case
had
been
transferred
to
him
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
all
of
them
should.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
there
was
never
any
question
of
the
case
being
tried
before
him.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
perhaps
this
would
be
a
good
moment
at
which
to
explain
the
practice
as
it
now
exists
in
the
southern
district
of
california
because
whatever
the
court
may
say
in
the
way
of
opinion,
i
take
it
will
deal
with
the
general
question
and
that
the
current
practice
which
went
into
effect
in
rules
promulgated
this
january
and
which
only
came
to
my
attention
yesterday,
i'm
sorry
to
say,
now
lay
down
that
the
court
will
find
that
the
rules
were
promulgated
early
in
january.
the
present
practice
is
to
have
one
district
judge
in
the
southern
district
of
california
in
the
central
division,
which
is
los
angeles,
hold
the
criminal
sessions
for
a
year.
so
this
eliminates
the
--
which
judge
choose
--
much
opportunity
to
choose
the
judge
before
you
come
into.
he
handles
the
docket.
if
there
is
a
single
defendant,
and
that
defendant
pleads
guilty,
then
the
judge,
in
the
criminal
sessions,
pass
a
sentence.
that's
very
easy.
if
there
are
two
defendants
and
two
plead
guilty,
the
same
way.
if
there
are
two
defendants
and
the
first
offers
to
plead
guilty,
the
court
does
not
accept
the
plea
but
then,
as
how
the
co-defendant
pleas.
if
the
co-defendant
pleads
not
guilty,
then
the
case
must
be
sent
out
for
trial,
and
i'll
come
back
to
what
happened
to
the
plea
that's
in
limbo
here.
the
case
is
sent
out
for
--
all
cases
are
sent
out
for
trial.
the
judge
who
is
in
charge
of
the
criminal
session
does
not
try
any
contested
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
just
takes
the
pleas,
handles
preliminary
motions,
arraignments
and
such.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
i
understand
it,
he
does
not
try
any
of
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then,
there
is
a
mechanism,
which
i
don't
know
because
no
counsel
knows
exactly
what
it
is,
by
which
the
cases
are
assigned
to
criminal
judges,
the
other
judges
in
the
district
by,
sometimes,
with
a
system
of
drawing
cards
out
of
an
envelope,
and
no
one
can
tell
exactly
what
judge
will
get
the
next
case.
it's
by
lot
with,
i
take
it,
some
method
of
seeing
that
there
is
an
equitable
division.
now,
when
the
case
is
sent
out
to
another
judge
where
we
have
one
defendant
who
has
offered
to
plead
guilty
and
one
who
has
pleaded
not
guilty,
the
judge
to
whom
the
case
was
sent,
not
only
tries
the
defendant
who
pleaded
not
guilty,
but
decides
whether
to
accept
the
plea
which
was
offered
of
guilty
or
to
--
it
could
be
withdrawn
and
both
defendants
put
on
trial.
so,
this
would
mean
that
from
the
time
the
case
was
sent
out,
one
judge
would
deal
with
it
entirely.
and
up
to
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
difficulty
that
gave
rise
to
this
case
has
now
been
corrected.
there
is
one
little
wrinkle
that
i
should
add.
sometimes,
a
situation
develops
where
one
defendant
offers
to
plead
guilty
and
the
co-defendant
is
not
arraigned
at
the
same
time.
in
that
event,
the
practice
is
to
enter
the
plea
of
guilty.
but
if
the
co-defendant
is
brought
in
a
week
or
two
weeks
later
and
pleads
not
guilty,
then
the
plea
of
guilty
is
automatically
vacated.
this,
of
course,
would
not
be
possible
under
counsel's
contention.
the
plea
of
guilty
is
automatically
vacated
and
the
one
judge
handles
the
entire
case.
this
is
implicit
in
the
rules.
the
rule
does
not
spell
it
out
exactly
as
i
have.
i'm
relying
on
what
was
represented
to
me
by
the
united
states
attorney
that
i
have
every
confidence
that
it's
an
accurate
statement
of
the
present
arrangements
in
the
district.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
can
--
i
can
only
speculate.
if
they
are
severed,
one
would
have
two
--
there
would
be
two
disadvantages.
one
would
be,
he
would
create
the
risk
that
there
would
be
a
divergence
in
the
sentences
because
they
went
two
different
places
and
judges
do
have
their
individual
practices
in
sentencing.
another
disadvantage
would
be
that,
after
all,
the
judge
who
does
hear
the
trial
will
know
something
more
about
the
crime
than
one
ordinarily
knows
on
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
archibald
cox
their
views
might
be
different.
you
might
get
--
well,
not
the
full
trouble
we
have
here,
[laughs]
but
something
like
the
inconsistencies
that
we
have.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
believe
that
the
--
that
the
--
i'm
--
i'm
drawing
an
inference.
i
wasn't
told
[laughs]
directly,
but
i
understand.
i
--
i
draw
the
inference
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
defendant
who
chose
to
stand
trial
would
be
tried.
that
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
both
of
them
would
be
sentenced.
mr.
archibald
cox
so,
the
plea
would
have
been
taken
but
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
plea
would
have
been
taken
but
the
sentence
wouldn't
have
been
passed.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
not
--
that
was
true
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
it
is
not
true
any
longer.
there
was
enacted
in
1960,
in
the
fall,
a
statute
that
deals
with
this
problem
which
provides
that
in
the
case
of
a
defendant
who
is
unable
to
make
bail,
that
when
he
comes
to
be
sentenced,
in
passing
the
minimum
sentence,
the
judge
may
take
into
account
the
time
spent
in
jail
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
so
that
the
problem
you
must
give
five
years
or
one
year
or
whatever
the
mandatory
minimum
sentence
for
a
particular
crime,
the
problem
that
created
no
longer
exists
because
the
present
statute
makes
it
possible
to
give
him
the
credit
if
he
couldn't
make
that
for
the
time
he
spent
in
jail.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
court
has
never
had
the
question
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
indeed,
there
are
very
few
cases
that
we've
been
able
to
discover
in
the
federal
courts
at
all
discussing
that
question.
there
are
--
there
is
at
least
one,
i
think
one
or
two
instances,
of
where
a
plea
of
guilty
was
vacated
by
a
district
judge
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant.
it's
a
case
cited
in
our
brief,
bielski
or
something
similar
to
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
not
in
this
--
no,
it's
a
district
court
opinion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
i
--
before
answering
that,
i
revert
to
one
further
consideration
that
i
think
should
enter
into
this
court's
judgment.
i
think
it's
important
to
bear
it
in
mind
in
evaluating
these
two
appraisals
of
what
happened
that
judge
hall
was
there
on
the
spot,
that
he
was
the
chief
ju
--
is
and
was
the
chief
judge
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
that
he's
an
experienced
trial
judge
and
was
far
more
familiar
than
we,
at
this
distance,
can
ever
be
with
the
problems
in
the
administration
of
the
criminal
docket
there
in
the
passing
of
sentence.
now,
the
ultimate
resolution
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
of
the
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
--
i
wasn't
seeking
to
draw
any
comparison
between
the
two
in
that
respect.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
ultimate
resolution
of
the
case
obvious
--
mr.
archibald
cox
certainly
for
the
administrative
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
matters
within
the
district,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
presume
that
would
include
the
transfer
of
cases
among
the
several
judges.
mr.
archibald
cox
each
would
have
an
individual
--
mr.
archibald
cox
each
would
have
an
individual
responsibility
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
with
respect
to
the
length
of
sentences.
i
suppose
it
could
be
said
further
on
this
point
that
judge
hall
presumably
would
know,
and
i'm
sure
i
do
not,
whether
the
sentences
which
he
considered
proper
in
narcotics
cases
were
the
deviation
from
the
norm
or
whether
judge
clark's
sentence
was
the
deviation
from
the
norm.
i
have
no
knowledge.
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
record
shows,
during
the
trial
--
during
the
trial,
it
was
brought
out
that
saldana
had
been
in
trouble
with
the
narcotics
laws
of
california
sometime
previously.
to
the
best
of
my
recollection,
there
is
nothing
to
show
that
he
was
ever
previously
convicted
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it
showed
a
conviction,
your
honor.
it
--
well,
i'm
sorry.
i'll
--
i
don't
want
to
take
the
court's
time
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
look
it
up,
and
i've
forgotten.
it
came
out
in
examination
of
the
--
of
the
federal
agent.
and
my
recollection
was
that
it
showed
arrests,
but
i
don't
specifically
recall
a
conviction
in
the
state
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
right.
and
then,
later,
but
we
don't
have
it
printed
here,
later,
a
document
was
put
in
the
record
showing
just
what
his
present
record
was.
it
was
used
to
refresh
licuanan's
recollection.
mr.
archibald
cox
unhappily,
we
don't
have
that
exhibit.
i
--
i
was
saying
a
moment
ago
that
here,
what
the
court
must
ultimately
do
is
to
determine
which
is
the
--
of
the
two
competing
appraisals
i've
tried
to
indicate
is
the
more
accurate
and
fairer
description
of
what
occurred.
now,
to
answer
you
directly,
justice
harlan,
i
am
not
urging
the
court
to
take
either
course.
i
don't
want
to
entirely
equivocate.
i
do
feel
that
this
is
a
matter
which
the
government
did
not
bring
about,
that
the
government's
position
was
not
responsible
for
its
arising
and
that
it
does
concern
the
judicial
administration
rather
than
the
conduct
of
a
trial.
on
the
other
hand,
while
i
don't
urge
either
course,
therefore,
if
i
had
the
responsibility
for
a
decision,
my
decision
would
be
to
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
to
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
sentencing
by
still
another
judge
in
the
light
of
judge
clark's
representations
and
whatever
other
comments
this
court
might
make
or
i
might
make,
having
the
power
of
decision
in
my
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
opinion.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
was
acquitted
under
count
1.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
trying
to
--
i'm
--
my
point,
i
think,
turns
on
the
distinction
that
i
make
between
my
impression
as
to
what
is
proper,
seemly,
would
strike
the
observer
as
fair
in
the
way
that
justice
ought
to
be
administered.
and
i
think
that
so
far
as
that
goes,
that,
as
i
see
it,
even
though
there
was
no
order
dismissing
3,
4
and
5
that,
while
the
case
was
before
judge
clark,
the
expectation
was
that
however
the
mechanics
were
worked
out,
the
maximum
sentence
would
be
five
years.
and
i
think
this
is
a
fact
to
which
more
weight
should
have
been
given
in
the
subsequent
proceedings.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it,
it
is
but
it
would
--
and
i
take
it
that
this
court
--
and,
therefore,
i
did
not
include
the
suggestion
that
this
court
should
set
the
amount
of
sentence
because,
except
in
contempt
cases,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
this
court
has
never
undertaken
to
indicate
just
what
sentence
should
be
imposed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
he
was
resentenced
on
count
2.
he
both
pleaded
guilty
to
it
and
was
convicted
on
it.
surely,
he
would
have
no
complaint
about
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
suggest
count
2.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
which
suggests
that
the
court
might,
perhaps,
simply
set
aside
the
sentences
under
3,
4
and
5
and
let
the
rest
of
it
stand
without
the
necessity
of
remanding
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
it
could
be
said
there
was
any
action
which
they
took
in
reliance
on
the
promise.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
well,
it's
--
it's
more
than
that.
it's
--
i
--
i
think
it's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'd
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
we're
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that,
your
honor,
because
it
--
i
think
it
involves
additional
elements.
not
only
was
one
judge
said
something
but
was
not
made
good
on
by
the
other
but
in
addition,
there
was
--
there
was
enacted
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
enacted
a
series
of
events,
transfer
of
the
cause,
the
vacation
of
the
pleas,
the
trial
and
then
the
sentence.
all
of
which,
i
think,
the
eye
--
to
the
eyes
of
the
petitioner
and
to
my
eyes,
creates
a
very
grave
danger
that
somebody
looking
at
this
would
say
this
was
just
an
elaborate
ritual
for
getting
rid
of
what
judge
clark
did.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
think
that
it
has
--
if
i
might
just
add
one
more
sentence.
i
think
to
have
a
serious
risk
that
that
is
to
create
the
impression
of
the
kind
of
the
--
the
way
justice
was
administered
in
this
case
is
a
greater
danger
on
the
whole
and
a
greater
risk
on
the
whole
than
the
risk
of
setting
aside
a
trial
which
corrected
judge
clark's
mistake.
i
suppose,
in
the
end,
perhaps
it
comes
down
to
the
fact
that
i
would
rather
err
on
the
side
of
the
too
light
sentence
than
err
on
the
side
of
too
much
severity.
it's
--
it's
because
i
have
doubt
about
that
and
because
it
perhaps,
in
the
end,
comes
down
to
such
a
very
personal
judgment
that
while
i
felt
an
obligation
to
come
here
and
expose
the
case,
i
did
not
want
to
make
--
urge
either
position
on
the
court.
but
as
i
said
to
justice
harlan,
if
i
had
the
power
of
disposition,
i
would
send
it
back
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
everything
that's
happened.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
i'd
--
i
will
like
to
argue
in
a
minute
that
you
are.
but
let
me
address
myself
in
two
ways
to
the
question.
first,
if
your
honor
does
feel
obliged
to
focus
on
two
--
on
a
specific
item,
the
two
that
seem
to
me
to
be
the
best
candidates
are,
first,
judge
hall's
denial
of
the
motion
to
transfer
the
case
back
to
judge
clark,
which
motion
was
denied
after
it
had
appeared
that
palomino
had
left.
and
at
that
stage,
the
element
of
the
same
man
handling
both
defendants
would
not
have
been
in
the
case.
and
while
i
feel
surely
he
had
the
power
to
grant
or
deny
that
motion,
conceivably
under
all
these
circumstances,
his
action
could
have
been
said
to
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
he
was
available
for
the
assignment
of
criminal
cases,
i
don't
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it,
he
could've
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it,
he
could've
made
himself
available
or
had
been
made
available.
i
take
it,
also,
that
the
defendant
probably
would
have
been
glad
to
wait
until
he
was
available.
the
second
candidate,
if
one
must
pinpoint
a
particular
error,
comes
to
a
more
troublesome
question,
and
that
is
the
problem
of
sentencing
because,
normally,
this
court
does
not
review,
in
a
criminal
case,
any
exercise
of
discretion
of
any
public
defenders.
under
these
unusual
circumstances,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
court
certainly
should
consider
whether
it
was
not
a
reviewable
abuse
of
discretion
for
judge
hall
to
impose
a
sentence
of
20
years,
quite
clearly
taking
no
account
of
the
promise
that
judge
clark
had
made.
now,
judge
hall
didn't
state
that
he
took
no
account.
i
must
acknowledge
that
that's
an
inference.
but
in
view
of
what
he
said
at
the
earlier
parts
of
the
record,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
quite
plain
inference.
now,
the
reason
i
said,
justice
frankfurter,
a
moment
ago
that
i
thought
it
wasn't
necessary
to
point
to
any
particular
ruling,
my
analysis
of
that
is
this.
that
there
can
be
occasions
where
each
ruling
goes
to
the
limit,
but
is
within
the
limit
taken
by
itself
but
cumulatively,
when
you
get
a
whole
sequence
of
them,
you
just
feel
this
has
gone
too
far
that
looking
at
anyone,
yes,
it
was
within
the
judge's
power.
no,
we
can't
fairly
say
that
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
but
when
you
get
a
sequence
of
them,
all
going
to
the
limit
in
the
same
direction,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
was
permissible
for
the
court
to
say,
“we
just
think
this
adds
up
to
something
that
we
can't
let
stand.”
mr.
archibald
cox
without
that,
i
would
have
no
difficulty.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
if
the
court
can't
let
the
whole
proceeding
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
if
the
two
things
i
point
out
won't
do,
then
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
judgments,
so
far
as
this
goes,
must
be
affirmed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
those
are
the
two
best
candidates,
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
my
difficulty
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
difference
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
--
i
would
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
do
not
think
it
could
be
said
either
that
judge
clark
passed
sentence
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
or
that
judge
clark
dismissed
counts
3,
4
or
5
of
the
indictment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that's
a
fair
description
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
what
took
place
before
judge
clark.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
i
am
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
the
chief
justice
--
i
was
listening
for
agreement
because
of
the
rule
that
your
honor
mentions,
but
i
thought
the
chief
justice,
if
he
mentioned
any
agreement,
it
only
had
to
do
with
the
district
attorney
saying
that
if
there
was
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
first
two
counts,
he
would
not
press
the
others.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
take
it
that
that
is
not
the
kind
of
agreement
which
binds
the
judge
or
purports
to
bind
the
judge,
nor
is
it
the
kind
of
agreement
which
has
always
been
regarded
as
invalid.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
certainly
many
instances
where
they're
frustrated.
i
think
that
it
must
be
rare
for
them
to
be
frustrated
where
they
depend
in
considerable
measure
on
the
representations
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
basic
difference,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
between
your
analysis
and
the
source
of
my
closing
judgment
as
to
the
right
result
goes
to
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
final
element
of,
i'll
call
it
unfairness,
unseemliness
in
this
case.
i
said
earlier
in
the
argument,
if
judge
hall
had
squarely
said
to
the
defendant,
“i
am
not
going
to
be
bound
by
any
agreements.
counts
3,
4
and
5
haven't
been
dismissed.
there
was
a
very
large
quantity
of
heroin.
you
can
withdraw
your
plea
to
counts
1
and
2
if
you
wish
and
stand
trial
on
all
of
them
or
you
may
leave
it
in
effect
if
you
wish.
it's
up
to
you.”
that
i
would
come
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence.
the
thing
that
has
troubled
me
from
the
beginning,
the
most,
would
be
a
difficult
case
anyway.
the
thing
that
has
troubled
me
from
the
beginning
is
that
taking
into
account
the
final
element
of
sentence,
then
when
i
go
back
and
survey
the
whole
thing,
it
makes
a
judicial
trial
in
the
federal
court.
they
looked
to
some
people
and
they
did
to
me,
after
a
good
deal
of
laboring
over
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
bit
of
mumbo
jumbo
to
get
rid
of
what
judge
clark
had
done.
now,
if
you
take
away
the
sentence,
that
impression
isn't
created.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
it
is
an
impression
of
the
whole
thing
and
that
there
are
times,
not
just
here
but
your
honor
will
think
of
many
more
instances
than
i,
where
one
judges
the
quality
of
what
occurred
by
how
it
ended
up.
and
there
are
problems
of
causation
in
those
effaceable
difficulties
there,
but
i
think
that's
what
i've
been
saying
to
your
honor.
it
may
be
wrong,
but
that's
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
the
original
source
of
the
difficulty
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
count
--
if
i
may
take
a
minute
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
court's
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
count
5,
that
the
conviction
was
proper.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
was
evidence
from
which
a
jury
could
find
to
sail
here
even
on
the
most
strict
common
law
standards.
but
certainly,
that
--
this
is
going
to
take
perhaps
more
time
than
i'm
entitled
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
was
certainly
a
contract
to
sell
between
the
federal
agent
and
saldana
resulting,
first,
from
a
telephone
conversation
and
later,
from
a
face-to-face
conversation
where
the
agent
said,
“i
want
10
pieces,”
meaning
10
ounces
of
heroin.
and
saldana
said,
“okay,
i'll
get,”
or
something
like
that.
at
that
stage,
there
was
clearly
a
contract
to
sell.
now,
the
question
comes
was
there
--
was
there
evidence
from
which
it
could
be
found
that
that
was
transformed
into
a
sale
and
by
a
sale,
i
have
in
mind
the
strict
common
law
definition
involving
a
transfer
of
the
property
in
the
goods.
now,
the
two
things
that
were
required
to
transfo
--
that
are
required
to
transform
a
contract
to
sell
into
a
sale
are,
first,
an
appropriation
of
specific
goods
to
the
contract
made
by
either
the
buyer
or
the
seller,
in
this
case
it
would
be
made
by
the
seller,
with
the
ascent
of
the
buyer.
that's
an
ascent
which
may
be
either
expressed
or
implied,
and
it's
an
ascent
which
may
be
given
either
before
or
after
the
appropriation
is
made.
i
won't
take
time
to
read
it
now
but
if
your
honor
will
look
in
rule
4
of
the
uniform
sales
act,
you
will
find
that
these
points
are
very
clearly
laid
down.
it's
discussed
at
more
length
in
professor
willison's
book
on
sales
at
sections
263
and
following.
now,
let's
look
at
the
evidence
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
seem
to
me,
it's
--
they
are
handled
in
a
different
way,
but
i
take
it
that
the
same
requirements
were
transfer
of
property
would
be
properly
looked
to,
that
is
the
way
the
lower
courts
have
generally
approached
this.
and
most
specifically,
to
accomplish
a
sale
in
the
normal
course,
neither
payment
nor
delivery,
as
your
honor
knows,
is
a
prerequisite,
provided
that
the
property
is
transferred.
well,
now,
here
-
here
plainly,
the
petitioner
did
appropriate
a
specific
10
ounces
of
heroin
to
this
contract.
he
got
up
from
his
place
on
the
sidewalk,
where
he
had
been
with
the
narcotics
agent,
went
over
to
this
1958
ford
that
came
up
and
got
a
bag
contending
10
oun
--
containing
10
ounces
of
heroin
out
of
it
and
started
back
to
the
federal
agent.
and
the
federal
agent
said,
“is
that
the
stuff?”
and
the
petitioner
said,
“yes.”
it's
plain
evidence
that
he
had
appropriated
the
goods
to
the
contract.
now,
is
there
evidence
that
the
federal
agent
gave
his
ascent
from
which
the
jury
could
find
this?
because
there
were
no
specific
instructions
on
this,
none
requested,
it
wasn't
really
an
issue.
if
your
honor
reads
the
arguments
to
the
jury,
there
was
no
argument
about
it.
petitioner
said,
“i
made
it
for
sale.”
his
counsel
said
to
the
jury,
“there
were
for
sale.”
and
everybody
went
on
to
argue
the
entrapment
point.
i
would
say
that
the
jury
could
infer
the
agent's
ascent
to
this
appropriation
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
huh?
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'm
not
relying
on
that
much,
your
honor.
i
agree
with
you.
[laughs]
i
didn't
--
no,
we
put
no
reliance
on
that.
[laughter]
i
think
that
he
ascended
in
advance.
the
first
two
transactions,
he
made
a
cursory
inspection
of
the
heroin.
the
second
transaction
--
the
third
transaction,
he
may
not.
he
simply
accepted
what
petitioner
handed
to
him.
and
then,
this
one,
he
said,
“have
you
the
stuff?”
he
--
i
think
that
a
jury
could
find
from
this
that
he
was
willing
to
have
the
petitioner
make
the
selection
of
the
goods
to
appropriate
to
the
contract.
let
me
put
just
one
example
to
indicate
why
i
feel
sure
that
neither
sale
--
neither
delivery
nor
payment
should
be
required.
suppose
that
i
were
to
telephone
the
local
druggist
and
were
to
say
“i'm
in
desperate
need
of
some
morphine.
have
you
got
a
prescription?”
“no,
i
haven't,
but
my
wife
broke
her
leg.
she
dislocated
her
knee
and
she's
in
terrible
pain
and
i
just
must
have
some
morphine
to
get
her
through
the
night.”
and
he
then
said,
“well,
i'm
going
out.
it
will
be
just
the
boy
here.
i've
got
to
hurry
off,”
and
i
said,
“well,
put
up
the
prescription
and
i'll
be
down
and
get
it
in
a
couple
of
hours.”
and
he
put
up
the
prescription,
marked
it
“professor
cox”
and
put
it
on
the
shelf
and
then
the
narcotics
agent
came
after
him
for
a
search.
i
haven't
the
slightest
doubt
that
under
those
circumstances,
when
neither
delivery
nor
payment,
that
there
were
--
you
would
agree
that
there
had
been
an
appropriation
of
the
goods
to
the
contract
and
that
the
sale
was
made.
and
indeed,
as
a
matter
of
commonsense,
it
should
be
held
to
be
made.
now,
this
one,
if
one
were
arguing
it
to
the
jury,
certainly
there
are
very
sound
arguments
that
could
be
made
against
my
position,
but
i
think
that
the
evidence
does
permit
a
finding
that
there
was
the
necessary
ascent
by
the
agent
to
the
petitioner's
prior
appropriation
and
that
this
made
out
the
necessary
elements
of
the
sale.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
jury
would
have
had
to
find
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
conclusions?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
under
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
the
petitioner
earmarked
heroin
for
the
performance
of
this
contract,
that's
one
element,
with
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
the
implied
ascent
of
the
agent,
and
that's
the
only
other
element
that
is
necessary.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
petitioner
took
10
ounces
of
heroin,
put
it
in
the
packages,
put
it
in
the
paper
bag
and
then
came
up
closer
to
petitioner,
as
i
read
the
record,
than
you
are
now
and
said,
“this
is
the
stuff.”
mr.
archibald
cox
then
the
agent
drew
his
gun.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
we
contended
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
think
it's
quite
true,
as
matter
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
it
was
on
--
that
--
well,
on
credit
with
the
vendor
asleep.
[laughs]
mr.
archibald
cox
the
petitioner
threw
it
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
perhaps
he
threw
is
with
the
intention
of
making
delivery.
[laughter]
i'm
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
going
to
say
to
justice
whittaker
that
let's
suppose
that
the
druggist,
go
back
to
my
telephone
conversation,
had
said,
“well,
alright,
i'll
set
it
aside
for
you,
but
unless
you
leave
$50,
the
boy
can't
give
it
to
you.
no
credit
because
i
don't
want
this
on
my
book.”
i
would
say
there
still
would
have
been
a
sale
because
he
had
appropriated
the
morphine,
in
my
example,
to
the
contract.
it's
my
morphine.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
ordinary
law
of
sales,
yes.
the
property
and
the
goods
have
passed.
the
passage
of
property
is
not
prevented
by
the
retention
of
a
vendor's
lien
or
the
retention
of
possession
or
the
failure
to
get
paid.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
sale
--
the
sale
is
completed
before
the
payment
even
though
delivery
is
conditioned
upon
payment.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
not
a
doctrine
i'm
inventing
for
the
criminal
case.
it's
a
little
difficult,
as
justice
black,
i
guess,
said
or
perhaps
you
said,
justice
whittaker,
to
apply
it
to
a
criminal
case.
but
what
i
am
saying,
certainly
in
general,
is,
as
i'm
sure
your
honor
recognize,
familiar
law
of
sales.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
anything
that
happened
after
the
petitioner
appropriated
some
heroin
out
of
a
general
mass
to
the
performance
of
this
particular
contract
with
the
ascent
implied
here
of
the
buyer
has
anything
to
do
with
whether
there
was
a
sale.
once
that
was
done,
there
was
a
sale.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
well,
i
--
an
example
along
that
line
occurred
to
me
when
i
was
thinking
about
the
case.
suppose
that
we
were
dealing
not
with
heroin
but
a
--
the
sale
of
infected
meat
under
a
statute
that
makes
the
sale
of
it
a
crime.
suppose
i
go
into
the
butcher's
store
and
say
“i
want
a
dozen
lamb
chops”
and
the
butcher
says
“alright,
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
per
pound.”
and
he
goes
and
starts
cutting
off
the
lamb
chops
and
shows
them
to
me.
“this
is
a
cash
and
carry,”
the
butcher
told.
he
says
that
--
and
i
just
nod,
and
then
he
puts
them
in
the
inner
wrapping
as
they
do.
he
puts
them
on
his
scales
and
at
that
point,
the
neighbor's
dog
come
and
runs
off
with
their
chop
--
with
the
chops.
they're
my
chops
that
he's
gone
off
with,
not
the
butcher's.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
unless
the
dog
made
delivery,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
you
are
willing
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
you
have
indicated
in
advance
either
that
you
accept
these
steaks
as
allocated
to
the
contract
or
that
you
are
willing
to
have
the
butcher
set
the
steaks
aside
as
your
steak,
then
a
sale
has
been
made.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
you
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
you
indicated
--
but
by
hypothesis,
i
stated
that
you
have
indicated
that
you
trust
this
butcher
to
set
them
aside.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
we
--
but
we
know
from
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
we
know
from
one
of
the
prior
transactions
that
he
was
willing
to
take
that
man's
word
for
it
because
in
one
of
the
prior
transactions,
he
did
not
inspect
the
heroin
before
he
accepted
it
as
under
the
contract.
well,
that's,
i
think,
an
interpretation
the
jury
could
have
made
on
the
facts.
and
i
submit,
your
honor,
that
this
really
is
a
familiar
law
professor
willison,
and
there's
many
examples
like
this,
has
treated.
