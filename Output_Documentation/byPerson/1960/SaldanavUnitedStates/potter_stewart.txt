you
mean
no
delivery
was
made.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
presentence
investigation,
rather
than
a
probation
report.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
explained
by
counsel,
he
knew
that
he
could
not
impose
any
sentence
less
than
five
years.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
apparently
thought
that
he
did
not
want
to
impose
any
greater
sentence,
so
under
those
circumstances,
assuming
the
validity
of
his
judgment,
there
would
be
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
not
much
to
consider.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
time
of
the
first
hearing
before
judge
hall,
mr.
solicitor
general,
it
was
already
clear
that
the
co-defendant
had
flown
the
coop,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
is
it
--
is
it
then,
accurate
to
say
that
at
the
time
judge
hall,
on
his
own
motion,
set
aside
these
guilty
pleas
and
refused
to
accept
guilty
pleas,
that
--
that
he
thought
that
both
defendants
were
--
that
--
that
both
defendants
were
going
to
be
tried
by
him?
