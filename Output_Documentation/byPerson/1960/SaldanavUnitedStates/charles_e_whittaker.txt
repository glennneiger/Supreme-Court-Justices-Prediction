justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
was
that
plea
accepted
by
judge
clark?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
pardon
the
interruption.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but,
had
there
been
any
order
at
all
with
respect
to
the
three
counts,
3,
4,
and
5?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
had
there
been
agreement
of
that
kind?
is
that
what
judge
hall
was
referring
to
when
he
said
this
looked
like
a
deal?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
when
you
say
everybody,
do
you
include
the
judge
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
would
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
contend
that
(inaudible)
pleas
are
not
going
to
(inaudible)
not
the
judge's
contention
and
that
you
could
not
be
asked
to
describe
on
counts
1
and
2--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
other
than
to
say
“he
couldn't
be
tried
(inaudible)
on
any
count”?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
that's
it,
that
it
would
be
inadmissible
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but,
if
that's
the
rule,
assuming
that's
true,
could
not
the
clerk
have,
as
justice
harlan's
question,
that
in
all
(inaudible)
counts
3,
4,
and
5
and
(inaudible)?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
has
he
testified
on
all
five
counts
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was
the
verdict?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
was
acquitted
on
count
1,
was
he
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
he
was
convicted
on
count
2.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
sentence
was
made
to
run
concurrently
with
the
sentence
on
count
3,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
how
were
you
hurt?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
requirement
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
was,
if
i
may
ask
you
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
what
your
theory
or
entrapment
that
was
supported
by
your
client
and
which
if
you
only
could
cross-examine
this
witness
about,
what
would
you
claim
is
constant
in
the
entrapment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
a
point
of
view
of
technical
about
it,
i
suppose,
there's
a
distinction
between
a
presentence
report
and
the
probation
report
that
actually
affects
it
i
suppose.
what
the
court
has
asked
you
is
not
a
probation
report.
he
said
no
because
he
couldn't
have
probation
anyway.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
can
we
view
in
about
that
though,
isn't
that
entirely
for
the
trial
judge
sentence
to
be
imposed?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
he
got
five-year
sentence
on
count
2.
does
that
exceed
anything
he
had
a
right
to
expect
under
his
talks
with
judge
clark?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
was
just
exactly
what
he
had
a
right
to
expect
of
that
conversation,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
i
shall
like
to
ask
you,
if
you're
concerned
about
the
appearance
of
this
one
case
in
the
sentence,
is
it
not
open
to
you
under
the
challenge
made
on
count
5
to
cut
it
in
half?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
do
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
we
don't,
as
a
matter
of
--
if
everybody
doesn't
know
and
therefore,
judges
shouldn't
know
that
sales
of
narcotics
are
probably
not
handled
as
commercial
transactions
are
normally
are.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
that
somewhat
different,
too,
than
leaving
the
package
at
the
drugstores
when
you
pick
up
your
wine
where
then,
after
the
agent
used
the
gun,
he
--
petitioner
threw
the
package,
as
i
understand
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that's
a
completed
sale?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
expressed
--
expressly
conditioned
your
hypothesis,
however,
upon
payment,
no
prejudice
involved
and
yet
payment
was
never
made
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
all
three?
you
have
to
say
something.
we
can't
just
set
them
aside.
well,
what
did
you
--
what's
the
basis?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
is
this
your
conclusion?
is
it
your
argument
that
the
court's
acceptance
of
petitioner's
plea
of
guilty
on
counts
1
and
2
constituted
a
judgment
covering
the
whole
case,
including
counts
3,
4
and
5?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
unless
it
was
a
judgment,
it
wasn't
the
action
of
the
court
nor
binding
on
anyone,
was
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
that
plea,
however,
related
only
to
counts
1
and
2.
that's
why
i
asked
you
then
if
it
was
your
contention
that
his
plea
of
guilty
on
counts
1
and
2
actually
amounts
to
a
judgment
covering
the
whole
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
it's
not
a
judgment,
then
i
don't
know
what
it
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
would
have
any
effect
as
of
a
binding
thing.
