where
does
that

this

the
conference

the
united

attorney,
is
it
not?

mr.

remained
throughout
before
judge
clark
and,
there,
you
have
the
single
appearance
presented
to
the

sentencing
further
requesting,
“i
think
i
will
not
undertake
it.”

where
the

perhaps
i'm
anticipating,

your
argument
that
you

justice
john
m.
harlan

that
has
the
effect
to
the
judgment.
