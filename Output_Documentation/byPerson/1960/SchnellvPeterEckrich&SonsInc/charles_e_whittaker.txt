justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
understand,
mr.
merriam
that
after
you
brought
this
and
it
should
join
allbright-nell,
some
type
of
process
is
extended
to
(inaudible)
the
--
it
thereafter
came
in
and
moved
to
quash,
the
court
sustained
the
motion
to
quash
that
process?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
thereafter,
it
moved
to
dismiss
and
that
case
is
dismissed,
is
it
correct?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
is
it
your
claim
that
party
did
thereafter
in
defending
the
peter
eckrich
company
under
this
contract
constituted
an
entry
of
appearance
by
the
allbright-nell
company
in
the
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
what
if
you
say
what
allbright-nell
had
done
before
it
was
dismissed
of
is
the
subject,
matter
you
rely
on?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
what
it
had
done
before
was
its
own
defense
wasn't
it,
moving
to
quash,
and
then
to
defend?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
merriam,
would
your
rule,
if
i
understand
it,
not
make
every
indemnitor,
every
liability
ensure
then
a
party
to
--
a
direct
party
to
every
suit
for
damages
within
the
coverage
of
the
policy?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
don't
they
always
do
that
even
that
the
policy
so
provide.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
your
law
doesn't
allow
direct
suits
against
liability
insurance,
doesn't
it,
in
illinois?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
only
one
state
provides
momentarily
more
like
it
does
and
that
is
louisiana.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
naming
it
as
a
party
