justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
--
the
respondent
isn't
a
real
party
in
interest,
is
he?
i
mean
he
can
--
if
he
is
the
real
party
in
interest
or
--
and
you
try
to
sue
him
on
that
basis,
you
wouldn't
have
succeeded,
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
this
case?
could
there
be
jurisdiction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
my
point
and
you're
really
--
the
whole
controversy
is
centered
around
the
venue
provision
and
whether
or
not
it's
been
waived.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
and
i
don't
see
how
to
talk
about
real
party
in
interest
helps
you
any
because
if
it
is
a
real
party
in
interest,
then
certainly
you
haven't
got
venue
in
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
indiana.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
would
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
in
--
in
the
sense
it
is
the
real
party
in
interest
to
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that's
--
what
that
looks
to
me
is
that
either
have
a
technical
question,
isn't
it?
we've
had
interchangeably
used
terms
a
little
bit
in
your
reference,
in
all
of
situations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
could
it
come
in,
who
brought
him
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
they
come
in
and
any
--
in
any
technical
venue
sense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
hadn't
named
them
and
they
had
conflict
--
they
had
conference
that's
able
or
actively
had
conducted
the
litigation,
would
that
have
been
a
waiver?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
defended
meaning
that
they
actually
(inaudible)
comfort
to
charge
him
a
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
what
is
called
defending
a
suit
for
venue
purposes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
that
circuit
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
were
--
were
all
the
--
all
the
other
actions
taken
in
the
name
of
peter
eckrich?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
how
--
how
do
you
charge
those
against
allbright
except
that
they
were
naturally
interested
under
their
agreement
and
as
the
whole
of
the
tracking
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
question,
whether
it
was
a
party.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
party
is
a
very
technical
term,
isn't
it
or
a
concept?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
language,
i
know
--
i
mean
language
but
let's
analyze
this,
mr.
merriam.
what
--
a
party
then
is
somebody
who's
merely
is
under
a
contract
that
is
on
this
customer,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
maybe
that
the
consequence
over
the
--
the
whole
process
of
a
litigation
may
bind
them
on
--
on
that
theory
to
what
extent
to
that
runs,
but
where
the
threshold
here,
namely
whether
the
mere
fact
that
he's
carrying
out
his
contract
of
the
customer
makes
him
a
party
and
the
venue
set
for
the
term
and
congress
has
darn
good
reasons
that
made
these
localizing
provisions
or
limitations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i've
done
my
share
in
favor
of
getting
waiver,
mr.
merriam.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
might
be
argued,
aren't
you
going
to
--
if
allbright
have
the
principal
people
then
why
don't
you
go
into
their
jurisdiction
and
sue
them
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
after
all
by
this
(inaudible)
sending
forth.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
are
suggesting
--
what
kind
of
a
question
is
--
and
determined
by
some
ultimate
principles,
a
very
tricky
character.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
i
understand
that
but
i
mean
even
the
general
considerations
on
an
ultimate
consideration
that
you
--
the
patent
venue
statute
is
a
particular
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
with
particular
provisions
deferring
from
other
venue
statutes
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
clear
tort
distinction
that
he
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
although
concededly
--
although
concededly
venue
precludes
bringing
it
into
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
it
conducts
to
the
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
how
many
court
of
appeals
cases
have
flatly
adjudicated
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
they
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
hurry
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
this
--
this
281?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
maine
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
fourth,
that
--
that's
three
as
i
count
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
now,
you
started
up
by
saying,
the
universal
practice
or
--
or
was
it
universal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
i
want
to
know
is
this?
these
four
court
of
appeals'
decisions
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
deal
precisely
--
explicitly
with
this
problem,
what
is
the
decision
of
the
four?
are
they
all
to
your
way?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
district
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
district
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
there
and
those
four
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
had
come
up
in
the
district
court,
any
--
any
district
court
that
didn't
go
up?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
when
you
say
patent
law
so
patent
practice,
so
why
do
you
depend
on
what
might
be
called
practice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
other
--
any
other
relevant
material
except
the
four
decisions?
what
do
they
--
what
do
their
reputable
right
on
dealing
with
this
problem
there,
is
there
any?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
calls
upon
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
--
how
recurrent
is
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
controlling
the
defense
isn't
decisive
as
you
indicate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean
for
that
--
but
it
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
take
care
of
the
venue
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
differentiation
is
the
fact
that
you're
a
main
defendant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
of
course
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
way
the
law
grows
by
having
lawyers
take
a
new
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
quite
follow,
he
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
in
his
home?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
patent
owner's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
the
--
well,
i'm
interrupting?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
go
on
ahead.
you
--
is
there
other
instance?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
that
if
this
litigation
on
the
merits
had
gone
against
eckrich,
it
would've
found
allbright?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
one
naturally
ask
this
question
which
i
take
it
was
rather
the
--
who
makes
that,
mr.
merriam's
argument,
namely
if
a
non-technical
party
is
so
involved
in
the
litigation
into
which
he
could
not
have
been
subject
and
in
which
--
into
which
he
could
not
have
been
drawn
and
into
which
he
is
not
a
formal
party,
yet
he
is
so
involved
and
related
with
it,
inexplicably
tied
up
with
it
that
the
judgment
is
foreclosed
against
him,
why
withdraw
practical
purposes
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
quite
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
pardon
your.
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
the
whole
question
is
whether
you
have
in
any
two
sense
waive
of
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what's
still
--
i'd
like
to
get
enlightment
indictment
on
is
why
if
allbright
are
so
committed
to
this
litigation
on
purposely
using
different
words,
if
they're
so
committed
to
this
litigation
by
their
conduct
in
it
but
a
human
practical
conduct
in
it
that
the
fate
of
their
interest
is
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
litigation,
that's
what
i'm
asking,
am
i
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
if
that
is
so,
why
isn't
such
commitment,
such
--
such
dependence
of
their
interest
of
safeguarding
of
their
interest
in
this
litigation
to
which
they're
not
a
party,
so
intrinsically
joining
up
with
an
entering
into
a
--
a
relationship
to,
that
that's
the
best
use
of
the
term
to
the
litigation
that
one
case
say
they
waive
the
right
to
abstain
from
being
so
involved.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
may
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
may
think
this
isn't
a
good
case
on
which
to
go
up
if
this
was
against
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can't
get
him
anyhow,
even
in
indiana
or
in
chicago?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
could
incidentally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
merriam,
before
you
sit
down,
i
wondered
if
you'd
say
a
word
more
about
the
merriam
case.
i
quite
agree
that
the
case
isn't
a
decision,
what
do
you
say
to
justice
pickering's
course
of
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there
--
why
do
you
--
a
great
deal
of
your
argument
unless
i
am
doing
injustice
to
it,
a
great
deal
or
--
or
forcible
part
of
your
argument
is
that
in
as
much
as
res
judicata
would
operate
against
allbright,
it's
little
unreal
is
that
the
face
the
actualities
of
life
to
say
that
they're
not
before
the
court.
am
i
doing
injustice
to
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
if
that
is
so
and
justice
pickering
says,
"there
are
good
reasons
for
--
for
having
res
judicata
applied,
the
litigation
comes
to
an
end."
then
they'll
all
looks
at
the
reality
who
says,
was
really
you've
--
you've
been
the
mainstay.
you've
been
--
you've
have
been
laboring
order,
at
least
you
took
it
to
get
this
result
and
therefore,
you're
welcome
to
say
that
--
that
you
aren't
really
before
the
court
and
you
really
were,
but
merely
by
sitting
in
and
conducting
a
litigation,
you
don't
make
yourself
a
party.
i'm
not
--
i
think
that
it's
not
an
unfair
summary
of
what
justice
pickering's
line
of
argument
was?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
are
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
would
be
a
still
nice
requirement
to
--
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
if
you
originally
joined
a
non-coercible
party,
as
a
party,
then
you're
before
the
court
if
you
really
defend.
but
if
you
don't
originally
join
but
later
asked
the
court
to
amend
the
complaint,
you
know
that's
a
little
bit
--
been
in
--
then
you
get
a
little
too
tied,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
there
hasn't
been
and
as
to
as
if
you
ogilvie
and
meyer.
certainly
today,
anybody
would
grant
after
that,
i
would
say
that
but
certainly,
with
the
present
day
of
liberality
about
the
amendment
adding
parties,
was
asking,
it
could
be
used
or
this
court
make
a
distinction
between
originally
having
joined
a
non-coercible
defendant
and
having
him
brought
in
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
had
the
plain
choice
on
--
on
ogilvie
and
merriam
and
they
neither
he
could've
come
in
without
--
if
nobody
would've
objected,
he
would've
been
in.
