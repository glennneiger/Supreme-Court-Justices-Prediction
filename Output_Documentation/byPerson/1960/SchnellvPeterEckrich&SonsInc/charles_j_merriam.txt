mr.
charles
j.
merriam
if
the
court
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please,
this
case
arose
from
two
patent
infringement
cases
brought
in
fort
wayne,
indiana
against
peter
eckrich
&
sons,
who
were
--
who
were
and
are
an
indiana
corporation
and
resident
in
fort
wayne
and
against
the
allbright-nell
company
which
was
an
illinois
corporation
having
its
main
place
of
business
in
chicago
and
not
normally
subject
to
service
of
process
in
indiana.
during
the
--
there
--
there
are
two
cases
because
one
patent
issued
after
the
first
and
was
started
and
was
joined
in
the
second
case.
during
the
progress
of
the
case
was
it
developed
that
the
allbright-nell
company
was
defending
the
litigation
and
controlling
it
in
accordance
with
a
contract
which
is
set
forth
on
page
2
of
the
record.
under
that
contract,
it
had
the
right
to
defend
the
case
to
the
exclusion
of
peter
eckrich
and
it
agreed
also
to
pay
all
of
the
damages
and
costs
that
might
be
awarded
in
that
proceeding.
because
of
that
contract
and
because
of
the
admission
that
it
was
in
fact
defending,
proceedings
were
undertaken
to
force
the
allbright-nell
company
to
answer
and
it
was
served
in
illinois.
and
after
that
service,
it
moved
to
quash
the
service
to
the
summons
of
subpoenaing
and
that
motion
was
granted
on
the
ground
that
merely
defending
the
case
did
not
constitute
a
general
appearance
and
thereby
bind
allbright-nell
company
to
be
sued
in
a
district
court,
it
was
not
ordinarily
subject
to
sue.
the
court
however
gave
no
opinion
and
granted
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
both
cases
which
were
then
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
which
decided
two-to-one
to
affirm
the
district
court
and
the
petition
was
taken
from
that
decision
of
the
court.
it's
our
position
here
that
a
defendant
so
named,
who
after
being
named
as
a
defendant
in
the
case,
continues
to
control
its
defense.
in
this
case,
they
even
instituted
a
counter
claim
in
the
name
of
peter
eckrich
asking
for
attorney's
fees,
which
would
have
come
to
the
allbright-nell
company,
is
in
fact
a
party
and
has
entered
a
general
appearance
in
the
case.
it
is
conceded
by
our
opponents
and
there's
no
dispute
in
the
court
that
allbright-nell
company
would
be
bound
by
the
decision
under
res
judicata.
that
is
not
contested
and
i
think
that
perhaps
the
most
pertinent
thing
in
that
point
is
to
explore
what
this
court
said
way
back
in
lovejoy
against
murray,
in
3
wall.
1,18,
was
the
reason
for
finding
a
res
judicata
against
a
person
who
was
not
a
named
party.
and
the
language
of
the
case
which
is
--
the
case
is
referred
to
by
our
opponents,
it's
not
in
our
brief,
but
the
language
is
so
good
that
it
appears
to
me
that
it
might
be
well
to
read
just
a
couple
of
sentences.
the
court
in
quoting
from
greenleaf
on
evidence
said,
"justice
requires
that
every
cause
be
once
fairly
and
impartially
tried,
but
the
public
tranquility
demands
that
having
once
--
having
been
once
so
tried,
all
litigation
of
that
question
and
between
the
same
parties
should
be
closed
forever."
and
then
they,
i
skip
a
little
bit,
"under
the
term
“parties”
in
this
connection,
the
law
includes
all
who
are
directly
interested
in
the
subject
matter
and
had
a
right
to
make
defense
or
to
control
the
proceedings
and
to
appeal
from
a
judgment."
this
right
involves
also
the
right
to
adduce
testimony
and
to
cross
examine
it,
examine
the
witnesses
adduced
on
the
other
side.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that
is
lovejoy
against
murray,

it
is
cited
in
the
brief
of
our
opponents
and
it
is
also
approved
in
another
case
cited
by
our
opponents,
the
souffront
case
in
217
u.s.
475.
in
other
words,
if
we
go
back
to
establish
the
basis
upon
which
res
judicata
is
established
in
this
case,
and
it
is
admitted
that
it
is
here,
is
because
the
party
who
is
so
estopped
is
in
fact
a
party
and
should
be
treated
as
one.
and
if
that
is
so,
it
is
our
position
that
when
he
comes
into
a
case
as
the
allbright-nell
company
has
done
here,
takes
over
the
control
of
the
defense,
examines
our
witnesses
and
his
own,
he
should
be
subject
to
the
right
of
discovery
on
our
part
and
he
should
be
subject
to
the
right
not
to
be
bothered
by
other
suits
brought
by
him.
and
as
was
shown
in
--
in
petition
for
certiorari
389
which
is
still
pending
before
this
court,
the
allbright-nell
company
did
institute
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
in
illinois
on
one
of
the
--
on
the
reissue
of
one
of
the
patents
involved
in
this
case.
and
it's
our
position
that
that
kind
of
thing
ought
not
to
be
permitted
merely
by
dodging
behind
the
unanimity
which
the
defendant
has
here
in
effect
established
by
not
intervening
as
he
has
a
right
to
do
under
rule
24
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
rule
17
of
course
says
that
the
case
shall
be
prosecuted
in
the
name
of
the
real
party
in
interest
and
i
gather
from
the
language
of
the
heading
which
applies
both
to
plaintiffs
and
defendant
that
the
word
“prosecute”
is
intended
to
cover
both
a
plaintiff
and
a
defendant.
at
any
rate,
the
filing
of
a
counter
claim
here
asking
relief
for
the
benefit
of
the
allbright-nell
company
would
seem
to
well
bind
it
within
rule
17.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
we
would,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
not
jurisdiction
in
that
state,
no.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
no
right.
but
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
that's
so.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
in
the
--
in
indiana
we
would've
in
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
and
in
illinois
which
is
still
the
same
circuit.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
we
would
not
if
we
had
sued
merely
the
allbright-nell
company
in
indiana.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that's
right.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
actually,
of
course
in
the
proceedings
in
this
case
where
it
is
controlling
the
situation
and
has
come
in
to
the
court
and
take
an
advantage
of
its
processes
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
it
came
in,
in
the
first
case
before
we
brought
the
man.
in
the
first
case,
was
brought
only
against
peter
eckrich
originally.
then
when
the
contract
was
discovered,
the
pleadings
were
amended
to
include
allbright-nell
company.
the
second
case,
they
were
named
in
the
very
beginning.
i
--
i
make
no
point
of
the
difference;
it's
merely
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no.
they
haven't
done
nothing
in
the
case
except
to
control
it
and
it's
our
position
that
does
waive
a
venue
but
they
--
that
is
the
only
thing
they
have
done.
they
did
not
come
in
and
waive
service
of
process.
they
have
done
everything
they
can
to
protect
themselves
if
under
these
circumstances
they
can
protect
themselves.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
under
the
ocean
accident
case
in
143
f.2nd
which
where
that
same
thing
happened,
they
held
that
they
could
name
there
was
a
party
even
after
the
case
was
over.
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
in
that
case,
the
--
after
--
after
the
proceedings,
the
insurance
company
was
named
as
a
party,
it
could
not
have
been
served
in
ohio
and
that
was
a
sixth
circuit
case.
our
opponent's
assert
that
the
statute
of
ohio
gave
jurisdiction
outside
of
the
state
to
serve
an
illinois
insurance
company
but
the
court
found
otherwise
because
it
--
it
quashed
the
service
of
summons
on
the
company
but
held
by
having
defendant,
it
was
a
party
and
could
be
so
named
and
proceeded
against
it.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
for
venue
purposes,
they
held
that
in
that
case,
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
it's
our
position
that
what
is
done
theretofore
in
defending
on
behalf
of
peter
eckrich
&
sons
constituted
a
general
appearance.
the
only
reason
for
the
service,
mr.
justice
whittaker
was
that
up
to
that
time,
we
had
no
way
of
establishing
on
the
record
that
allbright-nell
was
in
fact
there.
that
is
an
admission
of
peter
eckrich
&
sons
that
the
allbright-nell
company
was
present,
did
not
seem
to
us
to
be
a
sufficient
basis
on
the
record
for
so
finding.
it
was
only
after
they
were
named
as
a
party
and
did
something
that
there
is
a
basis
on
the
record
which
would
avoid
collateral
attack.
and
that
is
the
basis
upon
which
there
are
quite
a
number
of
cases
holding
that
it
is
not
proper
to
add
a
finding
in
the
record
that
so
and
so
was
defending
the
case
where
he
is
not
named
as
a
party
because
in
another
suit
where
he
can
say,
you
found
that
but
i
wasn't
in
fact
a
party
and
it's
not
binding
on
me.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
there
had
been
other
proceedings,
your
honor.
there're
a
number
of
depositions
taken
in
the
case
and
there
had
been
motions.
there
--
there
are
number
of
depositions
taken.
i
--
i
know
we
had
taken
some,
i
think
they
had
--
the
peter
eckrich
have
taken
some.
there
was
a
counterclaim
filed
in
the
name
of
peter
eckrich
asking
for
attorney's
fees.
those
are
the
things
which
we
say
constituted
the
waiver
not
the
moving
to
dismiss
nor
do
we
face
any
claim
of
jurisdiction
on
the
service
in
illinois.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
it
is
our
position
that
they
under
their
contract
were
appearing
in
a
situation
where
they
were
acting
as
a
party
as
defined
by
this
court
in
lovejoy
against
murray.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
in
lovejoy
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
language
which
i
read
in
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
no,
a
party
who
is
under
a
contract
to
do
it
and
does
so
in
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
--
in
case
and
acts
in
such
a
way
as
to
become
bound
the
result
of
the
litigation.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
that
is
correct.
they
--
the
have
a
venue
privilege
with,
they
may
or
may
not
waive.
there
isn't
a
question
they
can
waive
it.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
not
unless
he
did
in
fact
go
in
and
take
over
the
litigation
in
his
own
interest.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
that
the
policies
normally
do
so
to
provide
it.
i
assume
that
normally,
they're
carried
out
and
it
would
certainly
cover
the
ones
which
did
and
that's
what
the
ocean
accident
&
guarantee
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
did.
they
--
they
held
--
they
--
the
insurance
company
which
defended
the
case
to
be
a
party.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
--
that's
not
my
phase
of
the
practice
but
it's
my
understanding
that
you're
not
--
that
you're
correct
and
you're
not
even
allowed,
as
i
understand
it,
to
name
the
insurance
company
or
to
utter
any
statement
about
the
fact
there
is
an
insurance
company
to
the
jury.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
situation
so
far
as
authority's
goal
is
that
there
are
--
the
case
below
or
is
against
me
with
the
dissenting
opinion
of
mr.
--
of
judge
platt,
there
is
the
ocean
accident
case
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
my
favor.
since
the
petition
was
allowed,
the
case
of
dow
versus
metlon
in
281
f.2nd
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
although
dow
was
my
client,
i
did
not
know
about
that
case
until
after
it
was
reported
and
that
case
did
not
consider
any
of
the
really
relevant
law
--
earlier
authority,
it
missed
even
the
district
court
cases
in
its
own
district.
it
did
not
cite
ocean
accident
and
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
281
f.2nd
292,
dow
chemical
against
metlon.
the
--
our
opponents
have
relied
heavily
upon
the
case
of
merriam
against
saalfield
in
241
u.s.
22
and
28
but
that
case
did
not
do
anything
more
than
decide
that
there
was
no
res
judicata
present.
what
happened
there
was
that
a
copy
right
suit
was
brought
in
ohio
against
saalfield
and
after
it
had
been
remanded
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
before
a
final
judgment
was
entered
an
ancillary
supplemental
proceeding
was
filed
against
ogilvie
who
was
a
new
york
resident
and
the
court
held
that,
one,
that
there
was
no
res
judicata
on
--
on
the
basis
that
he
had
defended.
the
court
held
there
was
no
res
judicata
that
would
justify
joining
him
and
second,
that
even
if
there
were,
which
is
of
course
a
dictum,
this
was
not
the
proper
kind
of
an
ancillary
proceeding
(inaudible).
so,
that
it
did
not
attempt
to
pass
upon
the
question
that
we
have
here
either
in
the
decision
or
in
the
dictum
with
which
it
followed
it
up.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
haven't
tried
to,
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
one
might
well
be
done
and
a
distinction
might
be
made.
in
this
case
of
course,
not
only
is
there
a
charge
that
which
is
admitted
that
the
devices
here
were
made
by
the
allbright-nell
company,
there's
also
a
charge
that
the
--
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
the
peter
eckrich
&
sons
and
allbright-nell
company
to
have
--
to
infringe
the
patent.
and
while
the
factual
basis
of
that
is
not
shown
here,
the
charge
is
made
in
the
complaint
and
we
feel
it
was
justified.
i
think
a
--
a
distinction
might
well
be
made
upon
that
on
the
ground
that
the
allbright-nell
company
was
not
only
defending
its
contractual
liability
here,
but
its
own
right.
and
it
of
course,
if
there
is
a
judgment
of
patent
validity
would
be
bound
by
it
and
therefore,
it
sells
to
other
people.
this
don't
appear
in
the
record
but
it
is
in
the
record
if
it's
in
the
business
of
making
them
and
i
don't
think
it's
hard
to
assume
their
(inaudible)
sales
would
be
in
jeopardy.
so,
that's
here
not
only
because
of
a
contact
but
directly
in
its
own
interest
for
other
matters
and
that
might
be
a
ground
of
distinction
although
we
hadn't
felt
it
necessary
to
make
it
in
the
course
of
counterclaim
which
is
filed
here
in
that
--
in
the
name
of
peter
eckrich
asking
for
recovery
which
would
go
only
to
allbright-nell
company,
is
an
additional
ground.
we
also
think
it's
important
to
preserve
as
this
court
said
in
the
kerotest
case
to
--
and
--
i
haven't
got
the
citation,
i
have
only
cited
in
the
brief
that
there
should
not
be
more
than
one
case
on
the
same
subject
and
the
war
should
all
be
fought
out
in
one
spot
would
apply.
these
people
could've
intervened
under
rule
24
and
come
here
or
it
has
come
to
indiana
and
have
the
whole
war.
instead
of
that,
we
have
a
war
going
on
in
the
indiana
and
another
one
which
has
been
started
on
part
of
the
subject
matter
in
illinois
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
the
whole
doctrine
of
what
should
fairly
be
done
is
best
served
by
holding
that
a
defendant
who
comes
in
and
takes
advantage
of
the
discovery
rules
should
be
subject
to
them
at
the
same
time.

mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well
that
--
actually,
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
the
device
was
in
indiana
that
we
were
suing
on,
and
at
that
time,
it
was
the
only
one,
but
of
course
now,
the
--
we
could
sue
allbright-nell
in
chicago,
we
couldn't
sue
the
eckrich
company
there
who
was
a
party
with
conspiracy.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
and
this
happens
or
the
eckrich
company
has
agreed
that
it
will
go
to
illinois
if
we
ever
go
there
but
that
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
rights
and
we
were
the
ones
who
selected
the
forum
in
the
beginning
and
--
and
started
there.
it
does
change
a
number
of
rights
as
to
witnesses
and
depositions
which
they
haven't
taken.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
sometimes
it
is
and
sometimes
it
isn't,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
the
--
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
really
should
determine
what
the
words
should
be.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
this
court
has
so
held.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
mr.
rathburn
in
stating
that
the
plaintiffs
were
residents
of
chicago
has
overlooked
the
fact
that
mr.
schnell
who
is
one
of
the
petitioners
is
a
german
resident
who
lives
in
near
stuttgart,
germany.
i
don't
place
any
reliance
on
that
but
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
petitioner
carl
schnell
is
a
german
resident,
a
national
living
near
stuttgart,
germany
not
in
chicago.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
as
a
plaintiff
he
could
go
to
either
place.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
winget
case
which
mr.
rathburn
has
referred
to
was
one
in
which
the
defending
corporation
was
not
named
as
a
party
and
that
appears
from
the
opinion
itself.
in
the
freeman
case,
also,
it's
our
position
they
were
not
named
as
a
party
until
after
the
trial
was
over
when
they
merely
asked
to
add
them
as
a
party
to
the
pleadings.
and
while
mr.
rathburn
has
said,
i
haven't
made
clear
my
distinction
between
the
case
where
they
are
named
a
party
and
where
they're
not,
i'll
--
if
i
have
made
it
clear,
i'll
say
it
again.
i
don't
think
in
justice,
there's
any
real
reason
for
a
distinction
but
if
the
man
is
not
--
the
corporation
is
not
named
as
a
party,
then
there
is
no
pleading
to
support
a
judgment
against
him.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
pleadings
must
show
that
he
is
there
and
there'd
be
something
of
record
to
show
that
he
is
there
other
than
a
mere
finding
and
that
is
held
in
plenty
of
these
cases
that
it
would
be
subject
to
collateral
attack
merely
to
make
a
finding
against
one
not
a
party
that
he
is
a
party.
and
that's
why
i
have
made
the
distinction
in
my
argument
for
freeman.
i
think
in
justice
that
and
of
course
the
courts
hold
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
as
to
being
bound.
you're
bound
whether
you're
named
or
not.
the
two
facts
that
we
have
to
bother
as
here
of
whether
or
not
or
one
party
is
in
the
case
taking
full
advantage
of
the
court's
time
and
its
procedures,
it
should
not
be
bound
by
those
same
procedures
and
whether
it
should
not
be
bound
to
--
not
to
start
another
suit
while
this
one
is
going
on.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
his
--
his
argument,
as
i
read
it
was
that
the
petitioner
or
the
plaintiff
had
put
his
ground
on
the
basis
that
there
was
res
judicata
and
he
said
this
is
not
a
proper
argument
that
there
is
no
res
judicata.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
not,
but
there
is
this
difference.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
that
this
--
there
is
this
distinction
your
honor.
in
the
--
or
merriam-saalfield
case,
the
naming
of
the
party
was
not
done
in
the
original
case,
it
was
done
by
a
supplemental
bill
and
the
argument
was
made
if
they
had
a
right
to
file
a
supplemental
bill
as
an
insularly
proceeding
on
the
ground
that
there
was
res
judicata.
there
was
a
good
deal
of
dispute
is
to
whether
ogilvie
was
still
in
the
case.
he
--
that
was
disputed
but
--
and
the
court
passed
it
off
on
the
ground
we
first
--
we
find
there
isn't
res
jusdicata
which
you
allege
and
second,
this
isn't
an
insularly
proceeding
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
the
--
the
argument
which
i
am
making
was
not
made
there
whether
it
could've
been
or
not,
i
would
say
that
under
the
situation
where
it
was
a
supplemental
bill,
they
couldn't
have
made
the
argument.
at
any
rate
they
didn't
and
the
court
didn't
answer
it
and
i
don't
think
it
would've
been
applicable
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
i
think
not.
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
i
think
a
defendant
has
a
choice
once
he
is
named
as
a
party,
they
know
what
he's
going
to
do
from
that
time
on
and
it's
important
in
that
--
in
that
phase
of
it.
i
also
believed
--
mr.
charles
j.
merriam
well,
he
said,
i'm
not
in
anymore
when
it
came
to
the
supplemental
bill
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
he
want
to
get
out
but
didn't
pass
on
that
and
he
said
it
was
too
late.
but
here,
there
are
two
reasons,
one
is
that
the
defendant
has
a
choice
and
the
other
is
that
the
court
can't
enter
a
proper
order
unless
he
is
named
because
it
would
be
subject
to
collateral
attack.
