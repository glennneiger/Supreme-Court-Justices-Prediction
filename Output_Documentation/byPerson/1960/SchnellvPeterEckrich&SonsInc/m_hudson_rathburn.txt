mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
may
it
please
the
court.
so
that
i
don't
forget
it,
i
would
like
to
first
refer
to
the
dow
chemical
case
in
mr.
merriam's
statement.
that
case
did
not
consider
the
early
authorities
that
he
had
just
cited.
on
page
297
of
281
f.2nd,
the
court
in
the
dow
chemical
case
cites
and
paraphrases
the
souffront
case
which
mr.
merriam
just
mentioned.
and
they
said
that
the
principle
of
souffront
cannot
be
extended
to
satisfy
venue
requirements
and
to
make
one
defending
an
action
in
the
name
of
another
party
to
the
record
to
settle
in
(inaudible).
so,
the
court
in
the
dow
chemical
case
did
consider
the
older
authorities.
as
--
as
respondent
views
this
case,
we
have
no
question
here
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
that
and
venue
statutes
have
been
interpreted
by
this
court
in
stonite
and
fourco
and
there's
no
dispute
as
to
the
fact
that
they
exclude
their
--
section
1400
(b)
exclusively
governs
patent
problems
and
venue
cases.
and
neither
is
there
any
question
as
to
whether
or
not
venue
or
jurisdiction
over
the
person
can
be
waived,
either
expressly
or
by
a
course
of
conduct.
the
respondent
agrees
and
concedes
that
such
a
waiver
can
be
made.
marble
and
--
the
old
case
of
marble
metals
versus
--
versus
general
electric
say
that
at
287
u.s.
430
and
referred
to
in
the
fourco
case,
clearly
sets
forth
that
venue
maybe
waived
by
conduct.
the
question
before
the
court
is
simply
this
whether
or
not
in
a
patent
case,
the
course
of
conduct
which
is
heretofore,
been
universally
considered
not
to
be
the
waiver
should
now
be
so
considered.
now
petitioners
refuse
to
meet
that
problem,
they
don't.
they
add
--
they
seem
to
concede
at
least
in
their
briefs,
i'm
not
sure
what
mr.
merriam's
position
was
during
his
argument
that
a
manufacture
not
subject
to
jurisdiction
or
venue,
they
openly
conduct
the
defense
of
his
custom
or
without
waiving
its
venue
provisions
if
it
is
not
named
as
a
party,
but
that
if
it
is
named
as
party,
the
opposite
result
is
reached.
i
have
yet
to
hear
any
adequate
reason
(voice
overlap)
for
--
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
that's
the
distinction
that
he
makes.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
he
--
i
think
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
that's
it.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
think
he
also
concedes
that
if
it
is
not
named
as
a
party,
it
can
do
exactly
the
same
thing
and
there
won't
be
any
way
to
bring
it
in
the
court.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
there
are
four
that
i
am
familiar
with,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
one
is
the
freeman
sweet
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
the
freeman's
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
the
second
one
is
the
dow
chemical
case
which
is
decided
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes
and
there's
a
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
which
is
cited
at
--
which
is
25
--
no
this,
no
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
96
f.2nd

mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
kresge

mr.
m.

rathburn
yes

they're

of
our
brief.
the
freeman
sweet
case
is
cited
at
page
10
and
the
dow
chemical
case
at
page
11.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
the
fourth
one
is
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
it
has
--
i
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
about
what?
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
district
courts?
there
are
two
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes
there
are
two
district
court
cases
in
illinois
which
petitioners
rely
on,
both
of
which
were
appealed
but
in
neither
of
which
was
this
point
raised
on
appeal
and
the
court
below
speaking
of
them
said
that
they
could
not
be
considered
as
adjudicating
the
point
here
in
issue.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
i
don't
think
there
has
been
any
comment
on
it
by
writers
on
this
particular
problem
that
we
have
here.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
and
whether
you
waive
venue
by
this
particular
conduct.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
well,
the
first
to
these
cases
that
i've
cited
goes
back
to
96
f.2nd,
your
honor
and
those
are
all
the
cases
that
we've
been
able
to
find.
so
it's
--
to
me,
i
didn't
know
the
other
cases
existed.
this
was
a
completely
novel
theory.
i
had
read
all
the
cases
that
say
that
by
coming
in
and
defending
in
a
patent
infringement
suit
by
openly
defending,
it
will
become
res
judicata
after
final
judgment.
but
this
proposition
of
bringing
you
in
at
the
start
of
the
case
because
you
have
been
named
and
because
you
were
controlling
the
defense
was
a
completely
novel
proposition
to
me
until
this
case
came
up.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
it
is
a
res
judicata.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
no,
it
doesn't.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
that
is
their
position.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
now,
this
gives
a
rather
unusual
situation
if
this
rule
is
adopted
because
it
puts
in
the
hands
of
the
plaintiff
complete
control
over
whether
or
not
the
same
course
of
conduct
will
be
considered
a
waiver
of
the
venue
statute.
if
he
names
you,
he
said
it
is.
if
he
doesn't
name
you,
then
you
haven't
waived
the
venue
statute
and
i
don't
believe
that
as
i
--
seven
minute
ago,
i've
--
i've
failed
to
seem
the
distinction.
now,
i'd
like
to
look
at
some
of
the
results
that
would
follow.
if
this
rule
is
adopted
and
the
manufacturer
is
named,
there's
only
--
there
are
only
two
choices
for
a
reputable
manufacturer.
he
can
appear
and
defend
a
foreign
jurisdiction
and
that
disposes
of
the
venue
statute
or
he
can
file
a
declaratory
judgment
against
the
plaintiff
in
the
plaintiff's
home
jurisdiction
and
that
will
probably
be
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
so
the
protection
that
congress
has
afforded
to
people
charged
with
patent
infringement
is
substantially
initiated.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
in
the
patent
owner's
home.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
which
maybe
foreign
to
the
manufacturer's
home
forum.
so
in
either
case,
he
has
to
litigate
somewhere
other
than
where
congress
said
he
could
be
sued.
now,
if
he's
not
named,
he
has
another
choice.
according
to
this
theory
of
petitioners,
he
could
appear
--
not
--
not
appear,
i'm
sorry.
he
could
take
over
the
control
of
the
defense
but
if
by
an
amended
complaint
he
was
suddenly
named
the
defendant,
he'd
have
to
stop
or
he'd
be
in
court.
now,
i
realize
that
amendments
to
complaints
are
within
the
jurisdiction
or
the
discretionary
powers
of
the
district
court
and
they
might
not
be
granted,
but
i
don't
congress
intends
to
leave
venue
questions
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
if
--
no.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
no,
i
--
i
think
that
petitioner's
arguments
on
the
other
side
are
--
are
largely
words.
they
say
allbright-nell
is
actually
present
in
court.
that
doesn't
mean
anything.
allbright-nell
has
not
been
represented
in
that
courtroom
except
in
connection
with
its
motion
to
dismiss.
we,
as
attorneys
for
peter
eckrich
have
no
authority
to
act
for
allbright-nell
in
that
case
or
put
allbright-nell
in
the
case.
they
say
that
allbright-nell
can
take
full
advantage
of
the
judicial
processes
of
the
district
court.
again,
that
doesn't
mean
anything.
we
had
--
allbright-nell
has
no
rights
in
that
court.
in
fact,
it's
been
dismissed
out
of
the
court.
all
it's
doing
is
assisting
peter
eckrich
in
protecting
its
rights
and
there's
no
affirmative
relief
being
sought
for
allbright-nell.
mr.
merriam
once
referred
to
the
peter
eckrich
counterclaim
for
costs
and
attorney's
fees
but
those
are
not
sought
in
behalf
of
allbright-nell
and
they
couldn't
be
awarded
to
allbright-nell
in
this
case.
only
after
the
trial
can
it
be
determined
whether
any
or
all
of
these
expenses
were
paid
by
allbright-nell
or
peter
eckrich
and
peter
eckrich
certainly
cannot
be
awarded
costs
for
any
of
the
expenses
that
allbright-nell
paid.
it's
my
understanding
in
the
few
cost
matters
i've
had
that
you
have
to
make
a
showing
that
the
items
you
asked
for
as
costs
have
actually
been
expended
by
the
person
asking
for
the
costs.
certainly,
the
fact
that
peter
eckrich
has
asked
for
costs
is
not
a
submission
to
jurisdiction
by
allbright-nell.
now
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
--
this
question
--
excuse
me.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
absolutely.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
because
if
res
judicata
is
the
only
problem
he
has,
there
will
have
to
be
a
new
suit
brought
against
him
in
his
home
jurisdiction
where
he
is
present
and
where
an
accounting
will
have
to
be
held.
that
is
the
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
being,
as
you
say,
pulled
into
a
foreign
jurisdiction.
the
other
one
is
discovery
proceedings.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
the
plaintiffs
have
been
deprived
of
any
discovery.
allbright-nell
witnesses
have
testified
voluntarily
and
they've
been
called,
but
there
are
hardships
that
can
be
inflicted
on
a
corporation
if
it
is
sued
in
a
foreign
jurisdiction
so
far
as
taking
depositions
of
its
officers.
if
their
notice
for
deposition
and
the
place
where
the
sued
is
filed,
they
have
to
go
in
and
get
a
protective
order.
some
judges
won't
give
it
to
you.
some
judges
will
say,
"the
suit
is
here,
you're
a
party,
you
have
to
be
here."
those
are
the
only
practical
differences.
i
think
the
difference
is
largely
a
matter
of
principle
that
weâ€˜re
concern
with
here
is
to
whether
or
not
by
this
sort
of
conduct,
a
patent
owner
can
practically
avoid
the
venue
statute
simply
by
running
around
and
filing
suits
against
costumers
who
own
maybe
one
or
two
machines
when
they
know
about
the
manufacturer,
they
can
sue
the
manufacturer.
in
this
case,
both
the
plaintiff
and
allbright-nell,
i
should
call
the
residence
and
the
--
the
principle
attorneys
from
both
companies
are
in
chicago
and
i
think
mr.
merriam
didn't
quite
state
the
whole
case
when
he
was
asked
about
suing
in
fort
wayne.
the
--
the
machine
that
they
charged
to
infringe
was
in
fort
wayne
but
it
had
been
manufactured
in
chicago
and
it
had
been
manufactured
not
obviously
before
it
was
sent
to
fort
wayne
for
use.
so,
the
infringing
act
that
--
that
allbright-nell
could've
been
charged
with
was
completed
and
it
was
done
in
chicago.
this
is
simply
a
question
of
they're
having,
for
some
reason
that
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
out,
preferred
to
sue
in
fort
wayne
and
having
made
that
choice
i
don't
think
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
draw
the
manufacturer
in.
it
happens
that
fort
wayne
and
chicago
or
not
very
far
apart
in
this
case
but
it
could
as
well
have
been
florida
and
i've
been
in
cases
where
that
happened
and
where
i
resisted
successfully
exactly
this
thing
but
in
the
district
court.
this
case
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
yes.
well,
the
constitution
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
because
your
honor,
they
have
preserved
the
right
not
to
be
made
a
formal
party
so
that
they
can't
get
out.
allbright-nell
can
drop
the
defense
of
this
suit
tomorrow
if
question
--
if
circumstances
change.
they're
--
they
may
cancel
their
indemnity
agreement
with
peter
eckrich
for
example.
they
may
decide
that
they
want
to
change
their
structure
and
that
this
case
isn't
worth
defending
involving
only
the
one
machine
that
peter
eckrich
makes.
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
they
are
flexible
as
long
as
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
that
--
that
is
correct.
and
as
long
as
they
are
not
made
a
formal
party,
as
long
as
it
is
not
held
that
they
have
waived,
they
are
free
to
do
that.
once
there's
been
a
waiver
they
can't
withdraw
from
it.
now,
there
are
some
other
problems
that
arise
and
they
ought
to
be
considered
i
believe
and
that
is
whether
or
not
what
effect
this
would
have
on
the
general
practice
of
giving
indemnity
agreements.
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
it
is
the
general
practice
of
most
manufacturers
to
defend
their
customers
and
that
in
these
agreements,
the
manufacturer
usually
assumes
--
who
assumes
the
financial
risk,
insist
on
the
right
to
control
of
defense.
now,
first,
i
think
it
can't
be
again
said
that
patent
indemnity
agreements
are
socially
desirable.
they
ensure
retailer
or
an
end
user
of
a
manufacturer's
products
that
he
won't
be
subject
to
a
claim
for
damages
and
he
won't
be
deprived
to
his
use
of
the
product.
let's
say,
serve
to
protect
a
group
which
are
individually
weak
and
who
generally
can't
--
could
not
afford
the
expense
of
conducting
a
full-fledged
defense
of
a
patent
infringement
suit.
now,
they're
also
desirable
because
they
make
it
difficult
for
a
patent
owner
who
has
a
weak
patent
to
assert
it
against
weak
defendants
because
generally,
the
manufacturer
is
the
one
and
the
only
one
who
can
vigorously
resist
an
uncounted
--
founded
claim
of
patent.
as
we
have
previously
indicated,
the
--
that
the
manufacturer's
only
recourse
would
be
the
two
choices
that
i
said,
declaratory
judgment
or
no
indemnity
agreement.
and
while
this
might
not
be
anything
more
than
inconvenience
to
a
large
manufacturer,
it
could
be
disastrous
to
a
small
manufacture
if
he
has
only
the
choice
of
defending
himself
for
pursuing
a
declaratory
judgment
suit
in
a
--
in
a
forum
far
removed
from
his
home
base.
now,
i'd
like
to
look
well
briefly,
this
waiver
rule
that
petitioner
urges,
would
probably
result
in
manufacturer's
failing
to
indemnify
others
and
that
--
and
if
that
were
so,
if
that
notice
would
be
able
to
select
favorable
forums
and
by
a
series
of
suits
against
weak
resistance
or
non-resistance
build
up
a
situation
where
that
would
greatly
strengthen
the
prima
facie
validity
of
their
patent
and
that
it
would
be
adjudicated
in
a
weakly
defendant
suit
and
each
time
that
happens
it
gets
strong
in
the
next
suit.
now,
third,
i
think
we
should
look
at
what
advantages
the
patent
owners
get
if
this
rule
is
adopted.
first,
it
gives
them
a
virtually
unlimited
choice
of
jurisdictions
in
which
they
can
force
a
manufacturer
to
defend
the
patent
infringement
action.
and
it
was
to
avoid
just
exactly
this
situation
that
the
venue
statutes
in
patent
cases,
the
present
statute
and
its
predecessors
were
adopted.
in
the
stonite
case,
in
--
mr.
m.
hudson
rathburn
stonite,
315
u.s.,
decided
in
our
brief
at
page
566.
this
court
commented
on
the
fact
that
that
was
the
exact
purpose
of
the
special
patent
statute
to
limit
jurisdictions
and
which
patent
infringement
actions
could
be
brought.
the
second
patent
owner
would
have
a
somewhat
improved
position
as
far
as
pretrial
discovery
is
concerned,
but
they
can
get
that
by
suing
the
manufacturer
in
his
own
jurisdiction.
under
the
venue
statutes,
a
patent
owner
can
balance
the
advantage
of
suing
a
customer
against
advantages
of
obtaining
full
pretrial
discovery
against
a
manufacturer.
i
don't
think
he
should
be
given
both
choices.
he
can
pick
the
customer
where
he
wants
to
litigate
and
either
preclude
the
manufacturer
from
defending
or
bring
him
in
as
a
formal
party
to
the
litigation.
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
find,
this
exact
case
has
never
--
this
exact
situation
has
never
been
faced
by
this
court
in
a
patent
case.
however,
i
view
the
merriam
v.
saalfield
case
somewhat
differently
than
petitioner
does.
that
was
a
case
involving
unfair
competition.
after
the
--
if
the
case
was
openly
defended
by
the
owner
of
the
copyrighted
materials
that
were
involved
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
after
the
judgment
against
the
named
defendant,
a
supplemental
bill
was
filed
naming
the
person
who
had
openly
defended,
a
man
named
ogilvie.
and
the
court
said,
"appellant's
case
on
the
merits
is
rested
upon
the
theory
that
ogilvie
was
privy
to
the
original
suit
against
saalfield
and
an
actual
who
not
an
ostensible
party
thereto."
in
such
a
real
sense
that
the
final
decree
there
would
--
in
--
would
be
res
judicata
against
him.
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
as
against
him
notwithstanding
he
resided
outside
the
district
because
by
voluntarily
coming
in
and
defending
for
saalfield,
he
had
submitted
to
the
jurisdiction
and
waived
the
objection.
now,
that
is
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
saalfield
case
and
this
court
said,
"this
sufficiently
shows
the
weakness
of
appellant's
position
which
upon
analysis
is
found
to
be
this,
that
upon
the
theory
that
ogilvie
will
be
estopped
by
a
final
decree
if
and
when
may
it
sought
to
bring
him
into
suit
before
a
final
decree
as
if
he
were
really
estopped.
however,
convenient
this
might
be
to
a
complainant
in
appellant's
position,
it
is
inconsistent
with
elementary
principles"
and
they
refused
to
bring
oglivie
into
the
case
as
a
party
under
the
supplemental
bill.
now,
the
ocean
accident
case
which
did
permit
the
court
and
in
which
the
court
did
compel
the
defending
insurance
company
to
come
in
is
in
many
ways
distinguishable.
in
that
case,
they
did
not
bring,
attempt
to
bring
them
in
until
after
judgment.
also,
under
the
ohio
laws,
insurance
company
was
directly
liable
to
the
plaintiffs,
once
the
judgment
had
been
obtained
against
the
insured
and
i
think
that
those
are
two
distinguishing
facts
that
should
be
considered.
i
feel
this
way,
that
if
the
ocean
accident
case
stands
for
what
petitioner
says,
i
am
in
complete
agreement
with
the
court
below
that
that
course
should
not
be
followed
because
while
it
might
be
socially
desirable
in
insurance
company
cases
to
avoid
the
cost
of
the
separate
suit
against
the
insurance
company,
i
can
see
no
social
desirability
invoking
that
rule
in
patent
cases.
i
believe
i've
already
referred
to
the
fact
that
both
petitioner
and
respondent
are
residents
of
chicago
and
that
i
have
--
unable
to
find
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
suit
is
not
in
chicago.
if
it
had
been
brought
in
chicago,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
i'd
like
to
refer
closing
to
the
language
this
court
used
in
the
olberding
case
which
is
cited
at
page
17
of
respondent's
brief.
the
case
is
reported
at
346
u.s.
380
--
338
and
the
court
said,
"the
requirement
of
venue
is
specific
and
unambiguous.
it
is
not
one
of
those
vague
principles
which
in
the
interest
of
some
overriding
policy
is
to
be
given
a
liberal
construction."
while
we're
not
concerned
with
a
direct
construction
here
of
the
venue
statutes,
i
think
we
are
concerned
with
the
problem
which
would
in
effect
broaden
the
venue
statutes
and
i
sincerely
feel
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
