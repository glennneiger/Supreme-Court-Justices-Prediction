justice
charles
e.
whittaker
by
that,
you
mean
they
purchase
somewhere,
they
are
anchored
at
sea?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
state
is
arguing
today,
what
kind?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
they
are
doing
business
within
alaska,
does
it
mean
that
this
small
catching
boats
that
come
to
shore
operated
by
themselves
as
well
as
by
contractors?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
some
basis
in
your
taxing
act
to
contend
that
the
tax
is
on
that
act
of
catching
the
fish?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
there'll
be
no
doubt
that
alaska
might
have
power
to
impose
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
taking
fish
in
alaska.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
such
a
tax?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
you're
--
you're
jotting
down
to
subparagraph
(b),
are
you?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now,
that
says
freezer
ships
and
other
floating
cold
storages,
"an
annual
license
tax
equal
to
4%
of
the
value
of
the
raw
fish
brought
or
otherwise
obtained
for
processing
through
freezing"
period.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
does
that
suggest
to
you
that
the
tax
is
upon
obtaining
fish
for
processing
through
freezing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
4%
of
the
value
of
the
fish
bought
or
otherwise
obtained
for
processing
through
freezing.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
think
that
is
sufficient
to
include
or
to
be
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
taking
fish
in
alaska,
do
you?
is
that
--
is
that
the
section
you
rely
on?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
is
the
rate,
is
that
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
not
on
the
subject.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
statute
now
then,
if
that
--
if
this
applies
to
identify
only
the
line
of
business
then
what
statute
would
we
look
to,
to
find
the
subject
matter
upon
which
the
tax
is
imposed
or
the
incidence
of
the
tax?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
freezer
ships
and
other
floating
cold
storages?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
a
tax
for
what?
not
the
existence.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
alaska.
now
then,
is
there
any
language
here
that
imposes
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
taking
fish?
i
must
be
dense,
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
thurlow.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
--
did
you
urge
your
district
judge
--
judge
hodge
to
construe
your
statute
as
you
now
urge
upon
us?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
if
the
interpretation
of
your
statute
which
you
now
urge
upon
us
was
not
presented
to
nor
urged
upon
him,
should
it
not
be
--
is
it
not
commonly
true
that
the
best
court
to
interpret
a
state
statute
is
the
court
of
the
state
and
its
reasonable
construction
or
interpretation
is
binding
on
all?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
what
happens
to
interpretation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask?
would
the
terms
of
that
bond
continue
to
(inaudible)
the
advancement
of
the
state
if
the
state
should
be
remanded
or
determination
of
the
union
of
the
statute?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
this
really
on
the
aspect
to
--
to
obstruct
transportation
assumed
that
this
ship
were
on
the
shores
for
the
purpose
of
taking
--
freezing
the
fish?
then,
afterward,
they
were
loaded
into
a
ship
for
transportation
to
seattle.
would
that
first
operation
not
be
local
or
manufacture
of
processing
well
within
the
power
of
alaska
to
assess?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
i'm
asking
if
there
is
a
distinction
between
the
operations,
which
is
tantamount
to
two
operations
-
one,
freezing,
and
the
other
that
subsequent
transportation
and
commerce,
the
first
being
local
in
character
and
subject
to
regulation
by
the
power
of
the
state.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
upon
in
line
with
business
mainly
freezer
ships,
doing
business
in
alaska,
a
4%
of
the
value
of
fish
and
if
you're
doing
business
in
alaska
through
your
catcher
boats,
wouldn't
that
be
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
and
then
direct
them
perhaps
but
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
taking
fish
if
the
statute
be
given
that
interpretation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
your
(inaudible)
buy
fish
from
shore-based
reserves
in
alaska?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
you
did,
then,
those
fish
would
have
undergone
a
tax
in
alaska
under
the
statute,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
before
the
commerce
began.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
before
the
commerce
to
--
to
seattle
began.
