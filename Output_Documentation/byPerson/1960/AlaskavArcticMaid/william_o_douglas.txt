you'd
at
least
--
you'd
at
least
start
with
the
state
adjudication
as
to
what
the
tax
was
on
and
we
don't
have
that
here
at
all,
do
we?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
don't
know
what
the
--
how
the
state
courts
would
construe
this?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
because
the
--
your
court
of
--
our
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
changed
its
mind
in
--
on
the
incidence,
didn't
they?
justice

o.
douglas
the
latest
one
is

has
any
court
below
agreed
with
your
construction
as
to
the
incidence
of
this
tax
as
a
matter
of

o.
douglas
well,
that's
what
the
district
court
ruled.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
a
--
that's
a
first
position
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
william
o.
douglas
not
their
latest
position.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.

prosecuting
or
attempting
to
prosecute
any
of
the
following
lines
of
business.
justice
william

and
transports?
justice
william
o.
douglas

i
suppose
that
the
respondent
would
answer
you
at
this
point
that
--
that
by
your
own
argument,
this
is
not
a
tax
on

douglas
therefore,
the
--
oliver
iron
point.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
they
have

over
again
in
the
state
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
started
rule
in
a
territorial
court.
