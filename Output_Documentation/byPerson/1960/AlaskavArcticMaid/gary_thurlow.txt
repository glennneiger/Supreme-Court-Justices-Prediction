mr.
gary
thurlow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
beginning
in
1949
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
beginning
in
1949,
a
number
of
puget
sound
canneries
began
to
equip
ships
with
refrigeration
equipment.
at
the
beginning
of
the
summer
each
year,
these
ships
would
head
to
bristol
bay
at
the
beginning
of
the
red
salmon
fishing
season
in
bristol
bay.
bristol
bay
is
a
large
bay
in
western
alaska,
a
very
shallow
bay.
these
ships
would
load
on
about
seven
to
17
catcher
boats.
these
catcher
boats
are
fishing
boats.
they're
30
to
32
feet
long.
they're
about
10
feet
wide.
these
boats
would
be
carried
to
bristol
bay.
when
the
ships
reach
bristol
bay,
they
would
anchor
approximately
three
miles
from
mean
low
tide.
they
would
align
themselves
in
order
to
give
the
catcher
boats
rooms
--
room.
they
didn't
want
to
have
the
anchor
lines
or
the
freezer
ship
followup
the
gill
nets
which
the
catcher
boats
use
in
catching
salmon.
homer
kyros,
who
is
the
--
who
was
the
captain
of
the
arctic
maid,
stated
that
he
designated
his
anchorage
beforehand
and
that
when
the
arctic
maid
reached
bristol
bay,
it
anchored
at
this
anchorage
which
has
already
been
selected
and
then
the
fishing
effort
would
begin.
after
the
freezer
ships
had
anchored,
they
would
launch
their
catcher
boats
and
the
catcher
boats
would
fish
between
the
freezer
ships
and
along
the
shores
of
bristol
bay.
they
fish
right
along
the
beaches,
right
along
the
shore.
the
fisher
--
the
catcher
boats
were
manned
by
two
fishermen
each.
when
the
catcher
boat
load
a
salmon
or
when
the
fishermen
were
ready
to
come
back
to
the
freezer
ship,
they
would
return
to
the
freezer
ship,
the
freezer
ship
would
lower
the
net
onto
the
catcher
boat,
the
fish
will
be
thrown
on
the
net.
the
net
would
be
hoisted
through
the
ship
and
dumped
into
a
brine
tank.
there,
the
fish
will
be
frozen
and
after
the
fish
were
frozen,
the
fish
will
be
transferred
to
another
part
of
the
ship
where
it
would
be
stored
until
the
end
of
the
bristol
bay
red
salmon
fishing
season
or
until
the
freezer
ships
were
through
with
their
alaska
operations.
the
freezer
ships
spend
from
25
to
65
days
in
alaska
waters.
the
freezer
ships
purchase
some
fish
from
independent
fishermen.
the
record
doesn't
indicate
how
many
they
do
purchase.
there's
no
evidence
at
all
on
that
point.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir,
they
do.
they
--
they
probably
purchase
--
purchase
most
of
them
in
bristol
bay
while
they're
anchored
from
three
to
four
or
five
miles
outside
of
mean
low
tide.
the
freezer
ships
also
carry
on
some
operations
off
of
kodiak
island
and
in
southeast
alaska.
when
the
freezer
ships
operate
in
these
areas,
they
anchor
within
the
three-mile
limit.
the
freezer
ships
sometimes
fish
during
the
bristol
bay
king
salmon
fishing
season.
but
for
the
most
part,
freezer
ships
are
engaged
in
catching
red
salmon
during
the
bristol
bay
red
salmon
fishing
season
and
they
fish
for
the
most
part
in
bristol
bay.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir,
they
are.
king
salmon
or
chinook
salmon,
silver
salmon
or
coho
salmon
and
dog
salmon
or
chum
salmon.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
i'm
assuming
for
the
--
for
purpose
of
this
argument
that's
just
along
the
mean
low
tide.
i
didn't
think
this
court
would
get
into
question
whether
the
bristol
bay
or
any
part
of
it
is
an
inland
bay.
so
i
assume
that
there
would
be
no
inland
bays
in
it,
involved
here.
it
is
the
states'
theory
that
a
good
part
of
bristol
bay
is
an
inland
bay
and
has
historically
been
treated
as
such.
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
found
the
end
of
bristol
bay
to
be
an
inland
bay.
mr.
gary
thurlow
how's
that?
mr.
gary
thurlow
the
upper
portion
of
bristol
bay
to
be
an
inland
bay
and
they
refer
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
after
reviewing
the
record,
it
appears
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
operations
of
these
ships
occurs
within
that
area
which
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
on
its
first
hearing
of
the
case,
the
hearing
before
the
three-man
court,
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
operations
of
these
freezer
ships
do
occur
within
what
that
--
what
that
three-man
panel
called
"inland
waters,
the
state
of
alaska."
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
it
would
be.
the
freezing
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
well
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes
sir,
that's
right.
i
--
it
is
our
position
that
the
three-man
panel
of
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
was
correct
when
they
heard
the
case.
their
decision
was
later
withdrawn,
but
the
three-man
panel
said
that
it
may
be
that
some
of
these
freezer
ships
freeze
their
fish
outside
of
the
taxing
jurisdiction
of
alaska.
however,
they
catch
their
fish
within
alaska's
waters.
their
catcher
boats
do.
mr.
gary
thurlow
by
use
of
the
catcher
boats.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
it's
best
to
approach
it
on
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it's
much
better
to
approach
it
in
from
that
angle
i
think.
in
1949,
the
alaska
legislature
drastically
modified
the
tax
structure
as
an
effective
--
fish
processors.
the
first
such
act
of
the
1949
legislature
was
chapter
82,
sessions
laws
of
alaska,
1949.
under
this
act,
canneries
were
taxed
at
the
rate
of
6%
on
the
salmon
which
they
obtained
for
canning.
canneries
were
taxed
at
1%
on
the
salmon
they
obtained
and
diverted
to
purposes
other
than
canning.
later
that
same
session
--
and
also
crab
canneries,
herring
canneries
and
clam
canneries
were
taxed
during
this
act
at
a
rate
varying
from
1%
to
2
%.
later
that
same
session
in
1949,
the
legislature
passed
chapter
97.
under
this
act,
cold
storages
were
taxed.
cold
storages
were
taxed
at
1%
of
the
value
of
the
fisheries
products
which
they
obtained
for
freezing,
solving
or
processing
through
any
other
method.
in
1951,
the
tax
on
canneries
was
raised
to
6%.
shortly
thereafter,
the
chapter
97,
the
tax
on
cold
storage
--
storages
was
amended,
so
as
to
tax
freezer
ships
and
floating
cold
storages
at
the
rate
of
4%
of
the
value
of
the
fisheries
products
which
they
obtained
for
freezing.
the
--
most
of
the
freezer
ship
companies
refuse
to
pay
their
tax
on
a
theory
that
the
tax
was
unlawful.
in
1950,
territory
of
alaska
brought
suit
against
them,
and
1956,
the
district
court
for
the
territory
of
alaska
ruled
in
the
suit.
it
ruled
that
the
taxable
event
in
this
case
was
the
taking
of
the
fish,
the
catching
of
the
fish.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
i
believe
so.
it's
a
local
activity.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
they
haven't.
no,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
well
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
no
sir,
you
don't.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
you
have
no
idea.
mr.
gary
thurlow
you
certainly
don't
have
the
opinion
of
any
state
court
on
this
question.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
it
is.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
this
--
this
case
has
been
heard
four
times
now.
this
is
the
fourth
time.
on
--
on
the
three
times,
it's
already
been
heard.
the
court
found
the
taxable
event
to
be
in
a
different
place
each
time.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
no
--
yes,
it
is,
processing
by
freezing.
mr.
gary
thurlow
the
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
is.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
the
--
the
district
court
said
the
taxable
event
was
the
catching
of
the
fish
and
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
when
it
first
heard
this
case
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
the
court
of
panel
said
that
the
tax
was
on
the
freezer
ship
line
of
business
carried
on
within
alaska's
taxing
jurisdiction
and
that's
what
the
state
is
arguing
here
today.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that
freezer
ships
subject
themselves
to
alaska
taxation
by
doing
business
within
alaska
and
that
the
alaska
freezer
ship
tax
was
designed
to
reach
all
freezer
ship
activities
which
are
carried
on
within
alaska's
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
only
those
operated
by
themselves.
i
cannot
see
how
the
state
of
alaska
could
reach
fish
which
are
caught
by
independent
fisherman
and
which
are
sold
to
freezer
ships
outside
of
alaska's
taxing
--
taxing
jurisdiction.
mr.
gary
thurlow
we
have
a
statute
passed
by
the
1959
legislature
which
purports
to
do
that.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that
the
tax
is
to
cover
the
business
activities
of
freezer
ships
in
alaska,
wherever
they
occur.
and
i
think
that
if
you
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that
fact
that
they
are
doing
something.
mr.
gary
thurlow
anything.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
they
are
certainly
catching
fish
by
means
of
their
catcher
boats
and
after
reviewing
this
record
again,
it
appears
to
me
that
most
of
their
freezing
of
fish
also
take
place
within
what
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
once
called
an
inland
bay
of
alaska,
what
--
what
they
said
on
their
first
hearing.
okay.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
it
is.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
in
some
cases,
they
certainly
would
be
done
outside
of
the
waters
of
alaska.
i
--
i
thought
that
probably
this
court
wished
to
assume
that
no
part
of
bristol
bay
was
an
inland
bay
of
alaska.
and
if
this
is
so,
virtually
all
or
all
of
the
freezing
of
fish
done
by
these
freezer
ships
is
done
outside
the
three-mile
limit
other
than
the
fish
caught
right
near
kodiak
and
caught
in
southeast
alaska.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
is
not
relevant.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it's
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
the
case.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
don't
know,
but
that's
the
only
way
i
can
analyze
the
case.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
believe
it
would
be.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
from
our
point
of
view.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
believe
that
that
would
be
our
position.
mr.
gary
thurlow
he
doesn't.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no.
i'm
sure
my
adversary
will
concede
that
the
part
of
the
operations
of
these
freezer
ships
occurred
entirely
within
territorial
waters.
mr.
gary
thurlow
certainly,
he
certainly
would.
mr.
gary
thurlow
oh,
surely.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that
is
exactly
his
position.
mr.
gary
thurlow
none
that
i
know
of.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
would
say
that
the
predominant
feature
of
a
freezer
ship
operation
is
the
catching
of
fish
and
that
the
loading
and
freezing
of
this
fish
onboard
to
freezer
ship
is
an
incidental
thing
and
it's
--
it's
a
necessary
thing
which
inevitably
results
from
the
catching
of
the
fish
and
therefore,
it
is
local
in
nature.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes
sir,
like
digging
coal.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
it
appears
that
when
we
fist
argued
the
tax,
we
urge
that
the
--that
the
tax
will
--
was
actually
the
taking
of
the
fish
but
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
what
the
district
court
ruled.
now,
that
the
ninth
--
now
that
this
three-man
panel,
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
on
this
question,
i
personally
think
that
they're
unquestionably
right
and
that
is
that
the
tax
is
on
any
activities
they
carry
on
within
alaska's
taxing
jurisdiction.
i
think
--
and
that
is
a
position
the
state
is
urging
here
today.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
their
--
their
fist
position.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
won't
comment
on
that.
[laughter]
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
granted
a
rehearing
at
the
respondent's
request
and
they
simply
found
that
the
tax
was
on
the
freezing
of
the
fish
and
that
this
is
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce.
their
theory
apparently
was
that
the
loading
of
the
fish
is
similar
to
stevedoring
that
the
rule
of
joseph
versus
carter
&
weekes
would
apply
to
the
loading
of
the
fish
and
that
since
the
fish
are
there
in
the
(inaudible)
of
interstate
commerce
when
they
are
loaded
that
the
activities
which
occurs
subsequent
to
that
and
freezing
does
occur
subsequent
to
the
loading
would
also
be
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
respondent
in
his
brief
where
he
discusses
his
discrimination
argument
says
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
the
applicable
legal
principles
are
not
subject
to
dispute.
i
think
what
he
means
is
the
court
probably
won't
be
troubled
with
tangled
under
brash
of
cases
here.
i
think
the
problem
is
in
giving
the
proper
weight
to
the
facts
and
then
properly
characterizing
the
nature
of
freezer
ship
operation.
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
saw
a
freezer
ship
operation
apparently
as
a
freighter
that
calls
from
port
to
port
that
--
that
goes
from
seattle
and
goes
to
alaska
and
loads
up
with
the
cargo
and
then
returns
to
seattle.
but
by
categorizing
freezer
ship
operation
in
that
manner,
they
ignored
the
most
significant
aspect
of
a
freezer
ship
operation
which
is
the
fact
that
its
very
reason
for
existence
is
to
catch
fish
by
means
of
its
catcher
boats
and
because
it
does
catch
fish,
it
necessarily
follows
it
has
to
preserve
the
fish
as
they
are
caught.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
i
don't
know.
well,
yes.
you
mean
--
yes,
i
think
so.
the
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
sure.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir,
it
is,
because
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
clearly
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
set
--
set
forth
separately
from
the
major
and
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
on
the
following
industries
operating
in
connection
with
alaska's
fishing
resources.
i'll
--
i'll
read
it
to
you
because
it's
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
the
subject
of
the
tax
is
this,
"any
person,
firm
or
corporation
prosecuting
or
attempting
to
prosecute
any
of
the
following
lines
of
business
in
connection
with
alaska's
commercial
fisheries
resources
with
--
in
connection
with
alaska's
commercial
fisheries
shall
first
apply
for
and
obtain
on
the
conditions
here
--
here
and
after
set
forth
a
license
so
to
do
on
the
basis
of
the
following
license
tax
--
taxes
which
are
hereby
levied."
and
then
it
says,
"freezer
ships
and
other
floating
cold
storages
what
is
being
taxed
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
yes,
sir,
subparagraph
(b).
mr.
gary
thurlow
so
we
can
see
that
the
tax
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
it
doesn't.
because
to
me,
everything
that
falls
in
that
column
is
a
measure
of
the
tax.
it
says
"equal
to."
it
doesn't
say
the
tax
is
on
the
freezing.
it
says
the
--
the
tax
will
be
equal
to.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
--
i
certainly
don't
rely
on
the
measure
of
the
tax
to
find
the
scope
of
the
tax.
mr.
gary
thurlow
and
that
the
part
that
you
just
read
i
think
it's
clearly
the
measure
of
the
tax.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
fixes
the
rate.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
every
business
license
tax
i
think
has
a
taxable
event
in
a
measure
and
generally,
they're
different
things
and
they're
different
things
here
i
believe.
mr.
gary
thurlow
you'd
look
at
the
language
which
precedes
the
column
in
subsection
(b).
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
that's
the
line
of
business
which
is
being
taxed.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
for
engaging
in
the
freezer
ship
line
of
business.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir,
i
do.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
a
freezer
ship
is
a
--
is
a
type
of
business
which
does
many
things.
and
one
of
the
things
that
freezer
ship
business
exists
for
is
to
catch
fish.
it
doesn't
just
engage
in
one
activity,
it
engages
in
a
number
of
activities
and
the
catching
of
fish
is
one
of
the
activities,
which
is
an
integral
part
of
a
freezer
ship
line
of
business.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
it
moves
the
fish
back
and
forth
on
the
ship
for
better
storage.
mr.
gary
thurlow
cannery
ships
are
taxed
under
the
cannery
tax
and
floating
cold
storages
are
taxed.
these
ships
do
no
use
catcher
boats.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir,
we
have.
mr.
gary
thurlow
they're
taxed
at
a
lesser
rate.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir,
there
is.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
think
that
if
stevedoring
is
a
predominant
characteristic
of
these
freezer
ships,
it's
a
very
peculiar
type
of
stevedoring,
because
before
the
stevedoring
can
be
done,
the
stevedoring
company
has
to
go
out
and
catch
the
fish.
and
if
it's
shipping,
it's
a
very
peculiar
type
of
shipping
because
before
the
shipping
can
be
done,
the
shipper
has
to
catch
the
fish
and
hold
the
fish
for
the
remainder
of
the
fishing
season.
the
--
actually,
the
freezing
and
the
loading
is
keen
directly
to
the
catching
of
the
fish.
i
think
that
these
freezer
ships
could
successfully
operate
without
ever
leaving
the
alaska
waters
or
the
vicinity
of
alaska.
they
catch
and
freeze
salmon
for
the
duration
of
the
fishing
season
and
then
sell
the
frozen
salmon
to
land
based
canneries
or
to
ships
of
other
--
of
say
a
japanese
freighter,
which
is
equipped
to
preserve,
freeze,
salt
or
can
fish.
so,
this
could
be
an
entirely
intrastate
operation.
i
think
that
the
leading
case
is
all
oliver
iron
company
versus
lord.
here
again,
you
have
a
business
license
act,
an
occupation
act,
a
local
privilege
tax.
and
here,
the
measure
of
the
tax
was
6%
of
the
value
of
iron
ore
produced.
the
iron
ore
apparently
was
loaded
on
small
railway
cars
by
the
same
act
by
which
it
was
produced.
in
other
words,
the
steam
shovel
or
dragline,
this
isn't
said
outright
in
the
case
but
i
think
it's
--
this
is
only
surely
the
case.
the
steam
shovel
or
dragline
scoops
up
the
iron
ore,
dumps
it
in
the
railway
cars
and
then
the
railway
cars
are
assembled
in
--
into
trains
and
the
trains
are
loaded
onto
barges
and
the
barges
are
then
sent
to
other
states
where
the
iron
ore
is
unloaded.
now,
here
you
have
a
relatively
smooth
even
flow
of
a
commodity
from
the
time
it
severed
from
the
earth
to
the
time
it
reaches
a
market
in
another
state.
in
a
freezer
ship
case,
you
again
have
a
--
a
flow
of
a
commodity
from
the
time
its
caught
in
--
in
alaska
waters
until
the
time
that
it
reaches
seattle,
but
it's
not
an
even
flow.
it's
interrupted
by
the
fishing
season.
the
freezer
ships
stay
in
alaska
for
the
remainder
of
the
fishing
season
and
not
until
then
do
they
start
moving
towards
seattle.
so
--
so
i
think
that
the
freezer
ship
case
is
on
a
better
set
of
facts
in
the
oliver
iron
case,
oliver
iron
company
case.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it's
--
it's
more
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
mining
of
iron
ores
are
a
more
elaborate
activity
than
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
presume
he
will
argue
that.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
think
oliver
iron
company
would
still
and
be
on
point
because
in
oliver
iron
company,
if
the
ore
was
loaded
on
these
cars
and
what
was
the
purpose
of
putting
them
on
the
cars,
the
ores
is
--
and
to
get
them
to
another
state?
mr.
gary
thurlow
and
isn't
that
part
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
i
think
that
this
was
an
occupation
tax
and
the
occupation
was
mining
and
the
loading
of
these
railway
cars
is
mining.
i
think
it's
part
of
the
mining
operation.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
fishermen.
mr.
gary
thurlow
fishing
boats
are
not
taxed
to
such
that
they
were
at
this
time
the
fishermen
were
taxed.
mr.
gary
thurlow
oh
surely,
you
tax
them
at
a
heavier
rate
than
the
fish
caught
by
the
freezer
ships.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
of
all
the
fishing
industry
or
just
the
freezer
ships?
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
would
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
would
say
less
than
20%
because
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
less
than
20,
because
alaska
relies
largely
on
the
net
income
tax
act
--
on
its
net
income
tax
act
and
on
its
business
licence
act.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
and
when
i
say
the
business
license
tax
act,
that
means
excluding
the
taxes
on
fish
process.
so
i'd
say
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
i'd
say
close
to
20%.
mr.
gary
thurlow
not
more
than
that.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
alaska's
economy
is
sort
of
peculiar
because
it
depends
so
heavily
on
federal
spending
for
military
purposes.
it's
--
it's
very
heavily
dependent
on
--
on
that
type
--
on
construction,
military
construction.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no
taxes,
whatsoever.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
better
modify
that.i
think
that
at
the
time
these
taxes
in
effect,
they
had
to
buy
fishing
licenses
either
for
their
fishermen
or
possibly,
for
their
boats.
the
license
fee
would
be
nominal.
i
think
it's
a
regulatory
act.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
sir.
there
is
no
provision
in
any
alaska
statute
to
tax
them
on
that
basis.
mr.
gary
thurlow
didn't
touch
it,
so
i
guess
it
didn't
rule
it
out.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no.
it
wasn't
before
the
court,
it
was
an
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
wouldn't
have
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
no.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
isn't.
mr.
gary
thurlow
the
state
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
the
state
hasn't
been
collecting
the
tax
since
1955
and
it
didn't
collect
much
tax,
much
on
a
way
of
taxes
before
that
date.
there
is
--
there
is
no
injunction
against
the
state.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that
state
has
been
holding
its
hands
since
1955.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
don't
know.
that
was
before
my
time.
[laughter]
mr.
gary
thurlow
before
alaska
was
a
state.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
was
a
territory.
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
why
--
why
that
the
--
that
the
territory
didn't
pursue
these
taxes
act
of
those
years.
i
know
that
the
territory
certainly
will
pursue
these
taxes.
if
the
court
rules
in
the
state's
favor
and
i
know
that
we
have
kept
some
track
of
the
freezer
ship
operations
for
the
last
five
years.
we
are
in
a
position
to
build
them
and
we
have
built
them
for
the
last
two
years.
well,
i've
always
thought
that
the
most
important
problem
here
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
exactly
--
exactly
the
same.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
sir.
i've
always
thought
that
the
most
difficult
problem
in
this
case
was
the
question
of
--
of
discrimination.
alaska,
like
most
states,
taxes
its
businesses
with
--
under
a
business
license
act.
it's
a
--
it's
a
local
privilege
tax.
and
the
--
most
businesses
in
--
in
alaska
are
taxed
according
to
their
gross
receipts.
they
are
taxed
$25
for
their
--
for
the
first
20,000,
1/4,
1%
for
their
--
1/2%
to
1%
for
the
gross
receipts
up
to
100,000
and
1/4%
to
1%
for
gross
receipts
above
that
amount.
banks
are
also
taxed
under
a
business
license
act
but
the
measure
of
that
tax
is
net
income.
fish
processors
are
taxed
at
4%
of
the
value
of
--
at
--
or
taxed
according
to
the
value
of
fishery
products
which
they
obtain,
which
they
handle.
this
works
out
very
well
for
the
state
of
alaska
because
it
results
in
virtually
every
fish
which
is
caught
contributing
to
alaska
tax
revenues
and
contributing
to
the
cost
of
--
of
meeting
the
cost
--
conserving
alaska's
fishery
resources
and
maintaining
alaska's
fishery
resources.
all
fish
have
to
be
processed,
cured,
sold
and
handled
in
some
way
within
48
hours
after
they're
caught.
salmon
are
perishable.
and
federal
law
requires
that
the
salmon
be
handled
in
some
manner.
so,
by
reaching
the
processor,
alaska
has
pretty
successfully
reached
all
the
fish
caught
in
alaska.
that's
not
entirely
true
because
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
that
during
a
five
today
fall
seining
season,
some
vessels
in
ketchikan
will
ice
down
their
fish
by
ice
at
a
cold
storage
and
run
their
fish
to
seattle.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
the
discrimination
problem
is
this.
the
respondents
claimed
that
cold
storages
are
taxed
at
a
lower
rate
than
freezer
ships.
freezer
ships
are
taxed
at
4%
of
the
value
of
salmon
which
they
obtain.
cold
storages
are
taxed
at
1%.
on
the
face
of
it,
this
appears
to
be
discrimination,
but
it
isn't
because
cold
storages
and
freezer
ships
are
not
in
competition
with
each
other.
cold
storages
freeze
king
salmon
and
silver
salmon,
their
trolled
cut
salmon,
their
degutted
salmon,
their
higher
quality
salmon
and
their
frozen
for
the
fresh
fish
market.
they
never
go
into
competition
with
canned
salmon
or
as
far
as
i
know,
rarely
do.
the
fish
which
canneries
are
after
and
which
freezer
ships
companies
are
after
are
red
salmon,
pink
salmon,
and
dog
salmon.
these
are
especially
suitable
for
canning.
they're
--
they're
caught
by
seining
vessels,
they're
caught
by
gill-netters
and
they're
not
treated
this
carefully
as
the
fish
which
are
destined
for
cold
--
for
the
fresh
fish
market.
canneries
are
taxed
at
6%
and
freezer
ships
are
taxed
at
4%,
so
there
is
discrimination
but
the
discrimination
is
in
--
is
in
favor
of
interstate
commerce
and
it's
against
alaska
canneries.
and
this
is
true
i
think
even
if
you
include
the
seattle
business
license
tax
and
the
washington
business
and
occupation
tax
which
the
seattle
canneries
pay
because
of
the
fish
which
have
been
caught
in
alaska
by
their
freezer
ships.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
is.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no.
the
difficult
part
has
yet
to
be
discussed
and
that
is
this.
cold
storage
operators
do
freeze
some
fish
for
canneries.
this
is
an
isolated,
unusual
incidental
thing.
there
isn't
much
evidence
in
the
record
on
it.
there's
only
about
seven
or
eight
pages
in
this
entire
record
on
this.
three
witnesses
testified
on
this
problem.
pinkerton,
manager
of
the
ketchikan
cold
storage,
wallis
george,
manager
of
the
juneau
cold
storage
and
tom
park,
tax
collector
for
--
a
tax
collector
for
the
department
of
taxation.
pinkerton
had
to
admit
that
the
freezing
of
salmon
for
later
canning
was
a
“isolated
incidental
thing.”
wallis
george,
the
juneau
cold
storage
manager
said
that
in
a
27
years,
he
has
been
in
the
cold
storage
business,
he
has
only
canned
--
he
has
only
frozen
salmon
for
salmon
canneries
two
or
three
times,
two
or
three
times
in
27
years.
and
tom
park
testified
that
the
freezing
of
salmon
for
later
canning
is
an
expensive
process
and
it
is
not
readily
done.
on
redirect
examination,
james
pinkerton
said
that
the
freezing
of
salmon
for
later
canning
was
a
regular
occurrence
and
it
happened
each
year.
this
was
part
of
the
--
this
was
designed
to
rehabilitate
his
testimony.
now,
what
pinkerton
was
taking
about
was
the
canning
of
small
silver
salmon
which
are
caught
by
trollers.
apparently,
pinkerton
feels
compelled
to
buy
all
the
fish
the
trollers
bring
to
him
and
the
trolling
season
opens
shortly
before
the
sailing
season.
and
apparently,
he
does
buy
some
silver
salmon
and
--
and
freeze
them
and
sell
them
later
to
the
cannery.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
those
two
situations
are
analogies.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
what
--
i
think
that's
what
the
fact
show.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
i
misunderstood
you.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
there
was
no
testimony
to
show
the
reason
for
the
distinction
between
the
4%
tax
and
6%
tax
at
all.
mr.
gary
thurlow
there
was
some
testimony
with
that
effect,
but
the
--
the
thing
that
the
respondents
was
interested
in
urging
was
the
differ
--
difference
between
the
4%
tax
on
freezer
ships
which
freeze
fish.
mr.
gary
thurlow
and
the
1%
tax
on
cold
storages
which
freeze
fish.
they
--
they
wanted
to
show
that
the
tax
on
freezer
ships
was
four
times
as
great
as
a
tax
on
both
storages.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
and
these
are
the
relevant
taxes
because
freezer
ships
are
in
competition
with
canneries.
they
are
after
the
same
type
of
fish
and
the
fish
which
they
obtain
will
later
be
canned.
and
the
cold
storage
operations
are
--
are
totally
irrelevant
to
this
problem
even
though
a
cold
storages
have
on
occasion
frozen
some
fish
for
the
canneries.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it's
between
four
and
one.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it's
not
challenged.
mr.
gary
thurlow
pinkerton
said
that
this
was
a
regular
occurrent
each
year
but
he's
referring
to
these
cohos,
the
silver
salmon
which
he
did
feel
obliged
to
buy
controllers
that
came
to
his
cold
storage
plant.
george
was
in
the
same
business
in
juneau,
never
had
occasion
ever
to
mention
these
silver
salmon.
and
--
so
i
think
that
this
is
truly
an
isolated,
incidental
thing
as
pinkerton's
--
pinkerton
said
and
it
is
so
--
such
an
isolated,
incidental
thing.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
a
factor
which
you'd
expect
the
alaska
legislature
to
take
into
consideration
when
it
framed
a
series
of
taxes
designed
to
fairly
tax
all
fish
processors
in
alaska.
now,
there
is
the
problem
of
the
salmon
caught
in
alaska
later
be
in
taxed
in
washington.
mr.
gary
thurlow
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
only
one
last
point
to
make.
one
of
the
respondents'
contentions
is
that
the
taking
and
the
processing
of
this
fish
or
at
least
the
processing
of
this
fish
should
not
be
taxed
in
alaska
because
this
fish
will
later
be
taxed
in
seattle
or
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
i
don't
think
that's
a
good
argument
because
you
have
a
local
activity
in
alaska
and
that
local
activity
is
not
going
to
be
repeated
in
any
other
state,
so
there's
no
harm
in
taxing
this
one
local
activity
occurring
in
alaska.
it
makes
no
difference
whether
a
different
activity
which
occurs
in
seattle
is
taxed
or
whether
it
isn't
taxed.
it's
simply
irrelevant.
in
conclusion
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no,
sir.
it
--
no,
sir.
our
briefs
--
i
don't
think
that
i've
seen
any
briefs
in
the
record
and
i
don't
know
exactly
what
we
did
argue
to
judge
hodge.
but
apparently,
judge
hodge
was
led
to
the
--
to
the
view
that
the
tax
should
be
on
the
taking
and
i
suppose,
one
of
the
reasons
he
ruled
that
way
is
that
under
the
view
which
i
am
asserting
here
today,
some
of
the
freezer
ship
operations
are
likely
to
be
immune
from
any
alaska
taxes
whatsoever.
if
a
freezer
ship
lays
outside
of
alaska's
taxing
--
taxing
jurisdiction
and
if
it
buys
all
of
its
fish
from
independent
fishermen,
then,
i
do
not
believe
that
freezer
ships
would
be
liable
to
any
taxes,
whatsoever.
under
judge
hodge's
ruling,
freezer
ships
would
have
to
take
the
tax
responsibility
for
all
fish
which
had
--
had
come
from
alaska
waters.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
it's
difficult
to
answer
because
alaska
was
a
territory
at
that
time
and
the
--
the
appellate
court
for
the
federal
district
courts
was
the
ninth
court
of
appeals.
so,
if
you
can
consider
that
the
ninth
court
of
appeals
as
being
the
territorial
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
alaska,
you
at
least
have
two
opinions
from
that
court
to
go
on.
you
have
the
opinion
of
the
three-man
panel
which
i
think
is
correct
and
the
opinion
of
the
entire
court,
their
final
opinion
which
i
think
is
wrong.
mr.
gary
thurlow
certainly.
long
standing
administrative
inter
--
interpretation
of
a
statute
is
--
of
relevance
in
--
in
construing
the
statute.
mr.
gary
thurlow
not
in
my
opinion.
mr.
gary
thurlow
in
other
people's
opinion
it
is,
but
not
in
mine.
mr.
gary
thurlow
no.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
this
court
is
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
this
court
has
always
taken
that
position.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
agree.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
there
have
been
three
constructions.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
in
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
in
conclusion,
i
would
say
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
harsh
and
unfair
to
all
--
all
other
fish
processors
in
alaska
to
tax
him
at
irrelevantly
heavy
rate.
you
can't
raise
your
tax
at
6%.
this
is
a
heavy
tax
and
it
should
be
heavy
tax.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
would
much
prefer
to
see
this
court
rule
on
the
issues
because
i
think
it
is
in
the
position
to
rule
on
them.
mr.
gary
thurlow
he's
in
the
position
to
rule
on
the
constitutional
issues
involved
here.
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
i
agree
there's
some
ambiguity
but
i
think
this
court
is
competent
to
--
to
pass
on
what
the
measure
of
the
tax
is
and
what
the
subject
of
the
tax
is.
i
--
i
think
that
this
is
very
fundamental
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
good
if
this
supreme
court
should
rule
on
this
because
courts
are
in
confusion
as
--
as
to
what
the
difference
is
between
a
measure
of
the
tax
and
what
is
the
subject
of
a
tax.
i
always
sought
this
was
elementary
but
apparently,
it
isn't.
so,
i
would
like
to
see
this
court
rule
on
that
question.
of
course
you
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
well,
this
case
started
in
1955.
it's
--
and
it's
going
to
be
in
the
courts
for
another
two
or
three
years
if
the
court
rules
in
favor
of
the
state.
i
--
i
hate
to
see
a
case
drag
on
so
--
so
long.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
--
i
suppose
you
would
remand
it
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
alaska
and
then
i
suppose
your
respondents
would
move
to
have
it
removed
to
the
district
court.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
i
am.
mr.
gary
thurlow
oh,
i
get
lost
somehow.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes,
sir.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
don't
know
if
at
that
time
is
open.
mr.
gary
thurlow
yes.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
wasn't.
mr.
gary
thurlow
that's
right.
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
would
--
it
would
be
--
mr.
gary
thurlow
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
do
this
because
no
one
knows
where
this
case
originated
as
a
state
case
or
as
a
federal
case
because,
in
those
days,
the
territorial
courts
had
jurisdiction
over
cases,
a
state
nature
and
a
federal
nature
indiscriminately.
and
no
one
would
know
whether
this
would
be
sent
back
to
the
united
states,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
alaska
or
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
alaska.
there's
no
way
of
telling
this.
mr.
gary
thurlow
we
could
let
you
know,
surely.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
statute
of
limitations
as
to
tax
actions
of
this
kind.
mr.
gary
thurlow
not
in
alaska.
mr.
gary
thurlow
i
don't
believe
so.
freezer
ships
that
posted
the
bond
for
this
five
--
five
years,
i
would
certainly
hate
to
start
a
new
suit
and
loss
the
benefit
of
that
bond.[laughter]
mr.
gary
thurlow
thank
you.
