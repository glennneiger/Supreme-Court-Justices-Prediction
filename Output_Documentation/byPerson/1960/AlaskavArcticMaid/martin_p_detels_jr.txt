mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
i
want
to
discuss
three
preliminary
matters
and
then
come
very
quickly
at
the
question
of
the
incidence
of
the
tax.
the
first
and
i
think
it's
related
to
the
function
of
this
court
in
dealing
with
the
incidence
is
the
statement
that
the
respondents
here
have
not
paid
or
provided
for
payment
of
taxes
accruing
in
the
years
--
tax
years
since
this
case
was
tried.
chapter
71
of
the
session
laws
of
alaska
of
1955
requires
that
a
tax
liability
bond
be
filed
by
persons
applying
for
other
licenses
to
engage
in
any
business
in
alaska
that
the
amount
of
the
bond
be
twice
the
amount
of
the
estimated
tax
liability.
and
there
is
a
further
provision
that
the
requirement
for
a
bond
maybe
waived
if
the
attorney
general
finds
that
the
applicant
has
property
in
alaska
subject
to
alaska's
jurisdiction
in
an
amount
sufficient
to
cover
any
estimated
tax
liability.
not
all
of
the
respondents
have
operated
in
each
of
the
years
since
1954,
but
each
of
the
respondents
has
complied
with
this
section
which
i
now
speak,
by
either
posting
a
tax
liability
bond
or
obtaining
a
waiver
under
conditions
approved
by
the
attorney
general
of
alaska.
so,
the
alaska
is
protected
and
likewise,
the
respondents
are
extended
to
the
extent
of
10
years
of
tax
liability
as
i
stand
before
this
court
today.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
do
not
have
the
bonds
before
me,
your
honor,
but
we
made
an
effort
to
draft
them
in
a
form
which
would
make
their
validity
dependent
upon
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
and
if
there
is
any
remand,
i
would
assume
that
the
litigation
would
not
have
terminated.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statement
that
the
respondents
are
puget
sound
canneries,
that
is
not
a
fact.
what
the
record
does
state
is
that
the
respondents
can
their
fish
in
the
state
of
washington
and
that
is
all
the
record
states.
but
the
fact
is
that
their
fish
are
their
custom
canned
by
which
is
meant
that
someone
who
owns
and
operates
a
cannery,
cans
fish
for
a
custom
canning
charge,
the
property
and
ownership
of
the
fish
remaining
in
these
respondents.
now,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
administration
of
washington's
tax
laws,
the
respondents
for
whom
these
fish
are
canned
and
who
retained
the
ownership
are
the
canners.
and
the
taxes
which
they
pay
to
the
state
of
washington
are
paid
in
respect
of
that
canning.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
an
unusual
construction
of
the
tax
laws.
but
where
there
is
a
reference
to
the
canning
of
the
fish
by
respondents,
that
is
the
circumstance
in
which
they
are
canned
by
respondents.
finally,
with
reference
to
the
question
of
the
significance
of
the
three-mile
limit
and
the
territorial
waters,
in
its
last
opinion,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
did
not
need
to
decide
that
issue
in
order
to
pass
upon
the
validity
of
this
tax
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
that
is
a
correct
proposition.
the
court
assumed
that
the
freezing
and
storage
of
fish
by
respondents
was
being
carried
on
in
territorial
waters,
tested
the
validity
of
the
tax
on
that
assumption
and
found
that
invalid
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
if
that
position
is
not
sustained
by
this
court,
then,
the
court
will
come
to
a
due
process
question,
and
that
would
require
a
determination
of
the
extent
of
the
territorial
waters.
but
as
the
case
is
here
now,
there
has
been
no
such
determination
except
that
the
district
court
inferentially
ruled
that
the
normal
three-mile
limit
was
applicable
in
bristol
bay.
and
in
its
first
opinion,
which
has
now
been
withdrawn,
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
headland-to-headland
rule
should
be
applied
and
it
suggested
the
drawing
of
a
line
which
i
calculated
to
be
approximately
50
miles
in
lake,
from
one
side
of
bristol
bay
to
the
other.
now
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
the
evidence
in
the
record
on
this
issue,
i
would
say
consist
of
a
chart
from
which
these
distances
can
be
determined
and
that
is
all.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
amount
of
--
or
i
--
i
should
--
i
should
say
this.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
number
of
fish
loaded
aboard
respondents'
vessels
while
they
were
outside
the
three-mile
limit
if
that
is
the
rule
to
be
applied.
there
is
no
mechanical
method
of
calculating
the
respondent's
tax
liability
upon
the
predicate
that
a
portion
of
bristol
bay
is
an
inland
bay
not
subject
to
the
three-mile
rule.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
and
the
first
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
for
a
determination
of
what
activity
took
place
outside
that
line.
now,
as
to
the
incidence
of
the
tax,
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondents
that
its
final
determination
in
this
case
is
a
responsibility
of
this
court.
the
court
is
dealing
with
a
territorial
tax,
not
a
state
tax.
this
case
comes
here
from
the
only
court
which
could've
had
jurisdiction
for
the
tax
years
here
involved
of
the
--
of
any
litigation
involving
the
constitutionality
of
that
tax,
the
district
court
for
alaska
and
intermediately,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
in
any
event,
the
ultimate
responsibility
for
determining
the
practical
operation
and
effect
of
the
state
tax
claimed
to
infringe
the
commerce
clause
is
upon
this
court
as
in
itself
has
said
many
times
in
railway
express
agency
versus
virginia,
the
1954
decision.
neither
the
state
courts
nor
the
legislatures
by
giving
the
tax
a
particular
name
or
by
use
of
some
formal
words
can
take
away
our
duty
that
consider
its
nature
and
effect
in
which
inquiry,
we
are
concerned
only
with
its
practical
operation.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
and
as
i
recall
in
the
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
in
the
spector
case,
as
i
recall,
this
court
remanded
the
case
on
its
first
appearance
to
await
an
interpretation
of
connecticut's
law
by
a
connecticut
court
not
in
that
case
but
in
some
case.
now,
here,
what
is
being
suggested,
i
think
is
inappropriate
because
a
court
of
the
state
of
alaska
would
be
the
one
to
determine
the
construction
of
a
statute
of
the
territorial
legislature
of
the
territory
of
alaska.
and
that
some
10
years
after
its
enactment
and
some
10
years
after
taxes
which
for
all
practical
purposes
at
this
moment
had
been
paid
by
the
respondents
in
the
form
of
supersedeas
bonds.
but
i
hope
to
persuade
the
court
that
under
either
of
the
two
possible
constructions
and
i
think
there
are
only
two,
that
this
kept
tax
cannot
stand
and
that
a
remand
would
be
a
formal
and
useless
as
well
as
in
this
circumstance,
an
unfair
thing.
now,
what
is
the
subject
or
incidence
of
this
tax?
it's
the
prosecution
of
a
line
of
business,
in
this
case,
the
operation
of
a
freezer
ship.
this
is
to
be
compared
with
the
tax
imposed
on
land-based
coal
storage
plants
and
with
the
tax
imposed
on
land
based
canneries
and
floating
canneries.
none
of
these
statutes
is
made
to
depend
upon
the
taking
or
catching
of
fish.
the
territory
has
admitted
in
its
briefs
in
this
court
--
excuse
me,
i
should
say
alaska
has
admitted
that
this
is
a
tax
on
processing
activity.
so
a
tax
on
processing
activity
must
tax
process
not
fishing.
the
record
is
also
clear
that
land-based
coal
storages
who
from
1949
to
1951
were
taxed
like
the
respondents
in
the
same
subsection
of
the
same
act.
no
differentiation,
no
specific
reference
to
freezer
ships.
land-based
coal
storages
operate
no
catcher
boats.
they
take
no
fish,
whatsoever.
they
purchase
all
their
fish
from
independent
fishermen.
it's
obvious
that
alaska's
tax
scheme
of
which
this
section
is
apart
is
to
tax
not
the
catching
or
the
taking
of
fish
but
to
tax
the
processing
of
the
fish
after
they
are
taken.
the
record
at
305
and
306
and
at
335
and
336
sets
forth
the
fact
that
the
land-based
coal
storage
plants
do
not
engage
in
fishing
activities
of
any
kind.
if
this
tax
is
laid
on
the
catching
of
fish,
then,
the
petitioner
here
has
been
collecting
taxes
without
warrant
from
land-based
coal
storage
companies
for
the
12
years.
now,
this
record
also
shows
that
freezer
ships
can
and
do
purchase
fish
from
independent
fishermen.
for
all
that
this
record
shows
they
could
obtain
all
their
fish
in
that
manner.
now,
could
a
representative
of
the
respondents
come
before
this
or
any
other
court
and
say
that
they
were
not
engaging
in
business
as
a
freezer
ship
merely
because
they
chose
to
conduct
their
business
by
not
operating
catcher
boats.
i
don't
think
it
could.
now,
in
addition,
alaska
does
impose
a
tax
on
the
catching
of
fish.
and
it
knows
how
to
specify
when
it
--
intends
that
to
be
the
taxable
event.chapter
66
of
the
session
laws
of
1949
is
set
out
as
appendix
b
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
66
of
1949
as
set
out
as
appendix
b
to
our
brief.
and
mr.
thurlow
referred
to
it
as
a
regulatory
license
fee
and
i
think
he's
correct
in
that
statement.
but,
it
does
provide
for
the
requirement
of
a
license
and
the
payment
of
a
fee
for
any
person
who
fishes
commercially
for,
it
takes
or
attempts
to
take
salmon.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
as
it
originally
enacted,
it
was
$50
for
a
nonresident
fisherman
and
$5
for
a
resident
fisherman.
this
court
invalidated
that
discrimination
in
mullaney
versus
anderson
in
1952.
and
as
it
is
now
in
effect,
it
is
--
if
i
am
correct,
$15
for
a
nonresident
fisherman
and
$10
for
resident
fisherman.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
the
record
is
silent,
your
honor,
but
in
fact,
they
have
no
immunity
from
it.
there
is
no
indication
here
that
they've
ever
claimed
any
immunity.
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
tell
the
court
that
they
do.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
they
do.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
we
have
never
contended
before
any
court
that
alaska
may
not
impose
a
tax,
a
nondiscriminatory
tax
on
the
catching
of
fish
within
its
waters.
we
just
--
we
--
our
position
is
that
by
this
legislation,
it
has
not
done
so.
now
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
has
not
sought
to
tax
the
extraction
or
severance
or
taking
of
fish,
the
activity
which
can
be
taxed
under
oliver
iron
mining
company
versus
lord.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
territory
itself
has
answered
that
question
in
its
brief.
it
says
on
page
24
of
its
opening
brief,
presumably
a
tax
could
not
be
constitutionally
devised
which
is
levied
only
upon
fish
caught
by
freezer
ships.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
and
tax
them
at
a
different
rate?
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
that
a
discrimination
or
a
differential
which
is
reasonably
approximated
to
a
difference
in
the
actual
cost
of
enforcing
the
tax
laws
is
permitted
if
you
get
into
discrimination
or
differential
beyond
that,
it's
our
position
to
commerce
clause
would
not
permit
it.
this
record
does
contain
information
as
to
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
enforcement
against
the
respondents
as
compared
to
land-based
operators.
and
it
is
that
in
1949,
the
first
year
in
which
any
tax
was
imposed
upon
freezer
ships,
the
additional
cost
of
enforcement
was
$50.
in
1950,
the
second
year,
the
additional
cost
of
enforcement
was
$100
and
the
figures
do
go
upwards
from
1951
on
as
a
direct
result
of
the
quadrupling
of
the
tax
rate
upon
the
respondents
by
chapter
116
in
1951.
have
i
answered
your
question
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i'm
not
(voce
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
that's
our
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
now,
i
think
it's
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
i
--
i
would
think
that
the
legislature
could
classify
in
that
respect
and
impose
a
different
tax
rates,
but
i
would
also
suppose
that
the
higher
tax
would
have
to
be
imposed
on
the
higher
price
or
more
valuable
fish
whereas
what
we
have
here
is
the
opposite
of
that.
the
1%
rate
on
land-based
canneries
as
compared
with
the
4%
rate
on
the
freezer
ships
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
this
record
is
full
of
testimony,
your
honor,
to
the
effect
that
the
land-based
cold
storage
fish
are
more
valuable.
they
are
eaten
in
a
fresh
condition
prepared
for
the
table.
now,
i
think
it's
inherent
in
the
entire
argument
of
alaska
that
a
freezer
ship
is
somehow,
something
less
or
other
than
a
vessel
engaged
in
navigation
or
commerce.
i
do
not
think
that
that
position
can
be
sustained.
for
one
thing,
a
freezer
ship
proceeds
from
puget
sound
of
bristol
bay
at
the
beginning
of
the
season.
while
there,
it
serves
as
a
base
for
the
operations
of
these
smaller
catcher
boats
or
for
the
recede
of
fish
completely
independent
boats.
while
there,
it
loads,
freezes
and
stores
salmon
and
it
returns
to
puget
sound
at
the
end
of
the
season.
but
now
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i
will
try
to
persuade
you
in
that
fact.
well,
we
concede
that
respondents
are
not
common
carriers.
but
no
--
no
commerce
case
decided
by
this
court
turns
on
that
issue.
the
respondents'
vessels
are
in
the
language
perhaps
of
another
century
trading
for
their
own
account.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
common
carriage
is
a
comparatively
modern
byproduct
of
the
industrial
evolution
and
i
suggest
that
vessels
trading
for
their
own
account
were
more
familiar
to
the
frameworks
of
the
constitution
than
common
carriers.
michigan-wisconsin
pipeline
company
to
cite
a
recent
example
of
an
interstate
enterprise
held
immune
from
taxation
in
this
court
was
not
a
common
carrier.
it
owned
the
property
which
had
received
and
transmitted
through
its
pipelines.
i
could
go
on
to
many
other
similar
examples.
secondly,
there
is
the
argument
that
because
these
vessels
anchor
for
a
period
of
time
that
they
somehow
are
removed
from
commerce
and
navigation.
i
note
here
that
there
was
a
different
objection
made
by
alaska
at
the
time
of
trial
where
the
claim
was
that
they
moved
too
often
and
were
hard
to
find.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
only
in
the
pipeline
cases
is
there
simultaneous
loading
and
transmission
in
interstate
commerce.
a
common
carrier
vessel
must
necessarily
store
cargo
which
had
as
previously
loaded
while
it
is
loading
other
cargo.
in
every
case,
there
is
storage
as
an
aspect
of
carriage
of
cargo.and
if
it
is
refrigerated
cargo,
there
is
coal
storage.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
they
take
them
to
puget
sound
in
some
instance
in
seattle
and
they
are
there
canned
for
them.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
the
canneries
are
owned
by
other
companies
but
they
are
canned
for
the
account
of
the
respondents
and
the
respondents
retained
ownership.
now,
can
it
fairly
be
said
that
these
vessels
while
operating
in
bristol
bay
or
elsewhere
are
removed
or
withdrawn
from
commerce
and
navigation.
i
think
not.
and
i
suggest
that
if
i
were
to
come
here
in
defending
a
personal
injury
case
brought
against
the
operator
of
one
of
these
vessels,
for
an
injury
sustained
during
the
period
that
it
was
operating
in
bristol
bay
and
to
urge
the
court
that
the
respondents
did
not
warrant
the
seaworthiness
of
that
vessel
to
the
members
of
its
crew
during
the
period
that
it
was
anchored
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
fish,
i
would
get
short
shrift
from
this
court
and
i
would
deserve
short
shrift.
navigation
does
not
seize
to
be
navigation
because
at
some
temporary
purpose
which
requires
the
vessel
to
anchor
or
more,
the
principle
of
the
recent
case
of
west
versus
united
states
cannot
fairly
be
applied
here.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
the
object
of
the
commerce
clause
of
the
federal
constitution
is
that
every
farmer
and
every
craftsmen
shall
be
encouraged
to
produce
by
the
certainty
that
he
will
have
free
access
to
every
market
in
the
nation.
i
submit
that
that
principle
is
that
issue
in
this
case.
concretely,
this
court
has
held
that
louisiana
could
not
embargo
the
shipment
of
raw
louisiana
shrimp
for
processing
in
mississippi
plants.
that
south
carolina
could
not
hamper
by
regulation.
the
shipment
of
raw
south
carolina
shrimp
for
processing
in
georgia
plants.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
your
honor,
as
suggesting
that
there
are
two
different
vessels
involved?
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
it's
certainly
local
in
the
sense
that
it
occurs
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
under
the
assumption
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
if
there
were
two
separate
vessels
involved.
it
appears
to
me
that
we
would
have
only
the
discrimination
issue
to
place
before
this
court.
but
the
other
issue
is
that
when
these
vessels
are
loaded
aboard,
there
is
--
when
these
salmon
are
loaded
aboard
the
respondents'
vessels,
they
are
committed
irrevocably
to
interstate
transportation.
the
processing
which
is
performed
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
process
is
carried
on
aboard
that
vessel.
and
under
other
decisions
of
this
court
to
which
i
will
refer,
that
cannot
be
separated
out.
this
court
held
in
the
michigan-wisconsin
pipeline
case
that
texas
could
not
tax
the
receipt
of
natural
gas
in
texas
for
transmission
to
and
distribution
in
other
states.
it
held
in
joseph
versus
carter
and
weeks
and
other
cases
that
new
york
could
not
tax
the
compensation
received
by
stevedoring
companies
from
the
loading
or
discharging
of
cargo
in
interstate
or
foreign
commerce.
the
purpose
and
effect,
as
we
hope
to
demonstrate
of
the
alaska
tax
here
involved
is
to
promote
the
processing
of
alaska
of
raw
materials,
in
this
case
salmon,
by
taxing
their
preservation
for
later
canning
in
another
state.
and
the
activities
upon
which
the
tax
is
laid
occur
after
they
are
loaded
aboard
the
vessel
in
which
they
are
in
every
instance
transported
in
interstate
commerce.
to
validate
this
tax
would
be
to
make
the
borders
of
alaska
an
obstruction
to
the
flow
of
commerce.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
by
answering
what
it
found
to
be
the
critical
question
whether
the
activity
of
freezing
and
cold
storing
of
fish
while
lying
at
anchor
in
territorial
waters,
preparatory
to
transporting
such
fish
to
the
state
of
washington
is
an
inseparable
part
of
interstate
commerce,
and
it
answered
that
in
the
affirmative
that
it
was
an
essential
part
of
interstate
commerce.
now,
first
and
most
obviously,
all
activities
in
interstate
commerce
take
place
within
the
boundaries
of
some
state
except
as
they
may
occur
on
the
high
seas.
whether
they
are
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce
depends
on
whether
there
can
be
a
realistic
separation.
in
the
carter
and
weeks
case,
this
court
said,
"transportation
in
commerce
begins
at
the
least
with
loading.loading
is
preliminary
and
essential
to
transportation."
it's
conceded
here
that
the
only
activity
of
the
respondents
which
takes
place
prior
to
loading
is
the
catching
of
fish
and
i
think
that
it's
conceded
that
this
statute
is
not
imposed
on
that
act.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
you
have
to
preserve
them
in
some
manner.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no.
the
federal
law
requires
that
salmon
be
preserved
by
freezing,
icing,
salting
or
some
other
method
within
48
hours
of
being
killed
and
the
laws
of
nature
require
the
same
thing
in
any
event.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
yes.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no.
these
fishes
are
all
frozen
in
the
realm
without
any
sort
of
beheading
or
cleaning
of
any
kind.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
the
number
of
days
during
which
these
vessels
have
operated
in
waters
north
and
the
south
boundary
of
alaska
which
was
the
only
thing
we
find
we
could
agree
upon
seven
years
ago
appears
in
this
record
at
--
it's
exhibit
4
on
page
45
and
i
think
that
mr.
thurlow
has
correctly
stated
that
it
varies
from
about
25
to
as
many
as
55
or
60.
now,
in
this
case,
the
freezing
and
the
storage
take
place
after
the
loading
has
occurred.
the
transportation
is
impossible
as
well
as
unlawful
without
the
preservation
by
freezing
or
otherwise.
and
here
again,
i
reiterate,
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
power
of
alaska
to
levy
a
tax
on
the
taking
of
fish
within
its
waters.
to
the
extent
that
it
has
levied
such
a
tax
in
chapter
66,
that
tax
is
being
paid
by
the
respondents.
it's
alaska
--
pardon
me
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that
is
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
decision
in
effect.
i
--
i
would
attack
that
problem
from
this
standpoint.
this
court
has
said
that
where
you
have
local
activity
related
to
interstate
commerce,
you
may
tax
the
local
activity
but
you
may
not
buy
the
reach
or
measure
of
the
tax.
tax
the
interstate
aspects
and
the
amount
of
the
tax
may
not
be
increased
because
of
the
interstate
business
done,
cooney
versus
mountain
states
telegraph
company
was
such
a
case.
i
think
that
this
court
has
also
helped
me
with
that
problem
in
the
michigan-wisconsin
pipeline
case
because
it
has
said
that
a
taxpayer
has
received
benefits
from
the
exercise
of
state
police
power
and
protection
is
not
material
to
a
--
a
commerce
clause
question.
that
is
material
to
a
--
an
attack
under
the
due
process
clause.
in
the
pipeline
case,
the
tax
--
the
taxing
authority
emphasized
the
conservation
and
proration
measures
which
benefited
the
taxpayer.
this
court
said
that
though
the
enforcement
of
these
laws
has
been
in
the
public
interest
and
in
the
interest
of
the
industry
of
which
the
taxpayer
was
a
part,
is
only
relevant
to
show
that
the
essential
requirements
of
due
process
have
been
met
and
it
does
not
bear
on
the
validity
of
the
tax
under
the
commerce
clause.
now,
in
the
michigan-wisconsin
case,
the
holding
of
the
court
was
not
that
michigan-wisconsin
was
not
engaged
in
local
activities
which
might
form
the
basis
for
a
tax,
but
that
the
state
had
delayed
the
incidence
of
the
tax
beyond
the
point
where
local
activity
had
seized
and
interstate
activity
had
began.
in
that
case,
michigan-wisconsin
compressed,
cool,
scrub
and
dehydrated
gas
which
had
received
from
the
outlet
of
a
local
gasoline
plant
and
it
transported
it
over
its
lines
than
into
other
states.
the
case
also
involved
a
second
taxpayer,
panhandle
eastern
pipeline
company
whose
activities
were
determined
by
this
court
and
by
the
parties
to
be
identical
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
to
michigan-wisconsin.
panhandle
in
fact
made
local
sales
within
taxes
of
gas
that
it
received
in
the
manner
which
i've
just
described.
now,
here,
as
also
in
michigan-wisconsin,
there
is
the
possibility
of
a
multiple
burden.
there
is
not
only
the
possibility
in
one
sense,
a
multiple
burden
has
occurred.
if
alaska
may
tax
the
storing
and
freezing
of
this
salmon,
then,
certainly
washington
may
tax
their
cold
storage
because
they
are
cold
stored
in
washington
while
they
are
awaiting
discharge
to
be
canned.
and
it
was
that
possibility
of
a
multiple
burden
which
this
court
also
considered
in
the
michigan-wisconsin
case
as
an
additional
reason
for
invalidating
the
tax
and
in
many
other
cases
as
well.
the
power
to
tax
a
transaction
forming
an
unbroken
process
of
interstate
commerce
is
in
the
congress
and
not
in
the
states
or
in
a
territory.
now,
as
to
the
discrimination
point
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
the
tax
is
on
the
sale
from
an
independent
fisherman
to
the
respondents.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
and
if
it
takes
place
in
alaska
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
would
see
no
basis
for
resisting
it.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
in
essence,
that
was
the
situation
in
(inaudible)
versus
greenwood
if
i'm
not
mistaken
involving
a
cotton
broker
who
paid
an
occupation
tax
where
all
of
the
cotton
that
he
purchased
was
ultimately
shipped
out
of
the
state.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
they
are
very
nice
and
as
your
honor
said
in
a
case
which
i
can't
recall
right
now,
sometimes
the
language
describes
the
result
rather
than
process
of
reasoning.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
under
their
conditions
your
honor
described,
yes.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
and
i
--
i
don't
think
that
that's
any
part
of
our
position
here
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
if
there
is
a
transfer
of
title.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
understood
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
describe
a
sale
which
took
place
entirely
within
alaska.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
could
see
no
basis
for
attacking
the
application
of
the
sales.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
the
used
tax
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
a
tax
on
the
use
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
--
of
this
vessel
within
the
waters.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
the
use
of
boats
(overlap)
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
--
i
think
--
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
this
court
--
this
court
has
permitted
taxes
which
have
been
described
as
a
property
tax
or
an
intangible
tax
under
circumstances
not
greatly
different
from
this
case
without
the
discrimination
point
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
at
this
time.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
in
practical
operation,
this
tax
discriminates
against
the
interstate
transportation
of
salmon
caught
in
alaskan
waters
for
canning
outside
of
alaska
and
in
favor
of
the
canning
of
such
salmon
in
alaska.
it
makes
these
classifications
among
the
persons
engaged
in
the
freezing
of
salmon.first,
freezer
ships
taxed
at
the
rate
of
4%
of
the
value
of
the
salmon.
second,
land-based
coal
storage
plants
taxed
at
the
rate
of
1%
provided
the
salmon
are
not
later
canned
in
alaska
and
thirdly,
canneries
which
are
not
taxed
at
all
with
respect
to
the
freezing
of
salmon
which
they
later
can
in
alaska.
we
submit
that
if
in
a
single
statute,
a
tax
of
1%
were
imposed
for
processing
fish
by
freezing
with
a
further
provision
that
if
a
fish
were
canned
in
another
state,
the
tax
on
freezing
would
be
4%,
the
invalidity
would
be
clear.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
state
could
discriminate.
it
could
encourage
canning
at
the
expense
of
freezing
or
vice
versa.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
you
know
that
because
the
territory
of
alaska
had
no
power
to
legislate
with
respect
to
fisheries.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
it
had
no
proprietary
interest,
it
had
no
police
power.
it
was
prohibited
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
as
applied
to
alaska,
we
can
know
that
because
the
white
act
prohibited
alaska
from
denying
any
person,
any
united
states
citizen
the
right
to
take
or
preserve
fish
on
a
basis
of
substantial
equality.
and
both
the
district
court
for
alaska,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court
have
said
in
essence
that
negatives
any
police
power
or
whatever.
and
when
the
police
power
is
negative,
the
power
to
encourage
one
form
of
fisheries
activity
as
opposed
to
another
disappears
with
it
i
would
submit.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no.
but
this
has
come
up
in
connection
with
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
now,
we
submitted
to
the
territory
and
interrogatory
in
which
we
asked
them
what
differences
they
relied
upon
to
support
the
classification
that
they
made
in
their
tax
laws
as
against
these
respondents.
and
their
answer
appears
and
it
is
not
as
the
petitioner's
brief
would
have
one
believe
the
offhand
opinion
of
a
subordinate
tax
official.
it
is
a
sworn
answer
to
an
interrogatory
by
a
party.
and
i
think
the
whole
tax
of
the
basis
for
this
classification
is
of
interest
but
most
especially
the
part
appearing
at
the
bottom
of
page
259
and
the
top
of
260.
it
says,
"if
all
of
the
fish
frozen
aboard
freezer
ships
or
canned
or
processed
in
alaska
instead
of
the
states,
it
would
require
a
sizable
industry
to
care
for
them
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
territory
would
collect
about
twice
the
tax
that
the
freezer
ships
are
now
paying."
now,
this
court
has
at
least
twice
considered
legislation
which
had
the
same
objective
and
the
same
effect
as
this
act.
first,
in
the
case
of
foster-fountain
packing
company
versus
haydel,
the
facts
of
which
i
described
a
few
minutes
ago.
in
that
case,
louisiana
enacted
a
statute
which
prohibited
the
export
of
shrimp
from
which
the
heads
and
holes
have
not
been
removed
from
the
state.
but
it
permitted
the
export
without
restriction
once
the
heads
and
holes
have
been
removed.
this
court
found
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
act
was
to
preserve
the
business
of
processing
louisiana
shrimp
for
louisiana
processors
at
the
disadvantage
of
shrimp
processing
plants
in
biloxi
and
it
said
that
if
the
facts
bear
out,
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
affidavits,
the
case
was
before
the
court
on
a
demurrer,
then,
this
case
--
this
act
cannot
stand.
a
few
years
later
in
toomer
versus
witsell,
it
had
before
it
section
3414
of
the
then
south
carolina
code
by
which
south
carolina
required
that
vessels
taking
shrimp
within
the
waters
of
the
state
dock,
unload,
packed
and
stamped
their
catch
before
removing
it
from
the
state.
this
court
found
that
the
necessary
effect
of
that
requirement
would
be
to
inhibit
the
free
export
of
south
carolina
shrimp
to
georgia
for
processing
in
georgia
plants
and
that
it
invalidated
that
particular
section
of
the
south
carolina
code.
now,
at
the
same
time,
it
validated
a
poundage
tax
of
one-eighth
of
a
cent
per
pound
imposed
on
the
taking
of
all
shrimp
in
its
waters
by
whomever
taken
and
regardless
of
where
it
processed.
and
of
course,
there
can
be
no
objection
to
such
attacks
but
that
is
not
the
tax
before
the
court
at
this
time.
now,
the
differentiation
which
the
trial
judge
made,
the
distinction
he
made
in
not
following
these
cases
was
that
they
were
regulatory
measures
not
tax
measures.
and
of
course,
this
court
has
on
many,
many
occasions
said
that
the
tax
power
may
not
be
used
to
accomplish
of
forbidden
purpose.
in
freeman
versus
hewitt,
it
pointed
out
that
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
is
none
the
lighter
and
no
less
objectionable
because
it
is
imposed
by
a
state
under
the
taxing
power
rather
than
under
manifestation
of
police
power
in
the
conventional
sense.
alaska
here
is
seeking
to
accomplish
what
this
court
denied
to
south
carolina
and
to
louisiana
by
using
the
tax
rather
than
the
regulatory
power.
and
its
action
should
receive
the
same
treatment
upon
this
court.
now,
with
reference
to
whether
or
not
the
freezing
of
fish
for
later
canning
in
alaska
is
a
substantial
activity,
there
are
three
witnesses
who
speak
of
that.
two
of
those
witnesses
were
produced
by
the
petitioner
here
and
the
fair
essence
of
their
testimony
is
that
this
occurs
with
regularity
in
alaska
under
two
circumstances.
it
occurs
first
when
fish
suitable
for
canning
but
not
for
sale
as
fresh,
frozen
fish
are
received
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
prior
to
the
time
the
canneries
go
into
operation,
and
it
happens
secondly
when
there
is
a
large
run
of
fish.
and
the
canning
facilities
of
the
canneries
are
inadequate
to
handle
the
fish
as
they
are
received.
now,
there
is
some
testimony
that
this
is
an
isolated
thing.
there
is
no
testimony
from
which
the
court
confine
that
it's
1%
or
2%
or
5%
or
any
percent
of
the
business
of
land-based
cold
storage
plants.
but,
in
one
sense,
the
activity
of
these
respondents
is
isolated.

we'll

in

--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
yes,
sir.
now,
in
the
light
of
alaska's
failure
to
tax
the
freezing
of
salmon
for
later
canning
in
alaska,
what
significance
can
this
court
give
to
the
fact
that
it
imposes
a
tax
at
the
rate
of
6%
on
the
canning
of
those
fish?
we
submit
that
it
can
give
no
significance
to
that
for
three
reasons.
one,
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
how
a
state
treats
its
local
commerce
and
how
it
treats
interstate
commerce.
this
court
has
said
once
again
in
freeman
versus
hewitt
that
those
are
incomparable.
secondly,
the
record
shows
in
exhibit
8
that
washington
taxes
the
canning
of
those
ships
and
the
canning
of
those
salmon
and
respondents
pay
that
tax.
that
appears
at
page
47
of
the
record.
that
washington
for
the
time
being
has
imposed
a
tax
which
added
to
the
4%
imposed
upon
respondents
by
alaska
that
the
total
of
those
two
taxes
doesn't
equal
6%
is
of
no
constitutional
significance
because
there
is
no
constitutional
inhibition
on
alaska
--
on
washington
increasing
its
tax
rate
to
any
percentage
that
it
sees
fit
to
do
so.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no,
there
has
not
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
it
taxes
manufacturing.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
in
washington.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
in
washington.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
yes.
these
fishes
are
all
canned
in
washington.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
well,
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
could
be
no
fish
to
can
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
as
far
as
this
record
shows
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
of
1%
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
of
1%.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
that
is
true.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
and
i
can't
point
to
the
record
page
at
this
moment.
in
the
testimony
of
wallis
george
to
the
effect
that
frozen
salmon
has
been
shipped
from
his
cannery
to
seattle
for
canning
in
seattle.
but
the
testimony
is
not
--
that
goes
no
further
than
i've
just
stated.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
discrimination
point
is
the
matter
which
i
referred
to
earlier
that
the
tax
on
the
intrastate
portion
of
an
interstate
enterprise
must
be
imposed
solely
on
account
of
the
local
activity
and
may
not
be
increased
because
of
interstate
activity
or
out
of
state
activity.
and
by
referring
to
this
6%
tax
which
it
imposes
on
its
own
canneries,
alaska
is
asking
this
court
to
give
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
respondents
also
can
their
fish
and
justify
the
tax
on
that
basis
when
that
activity
takes
place
in
washington
and
is
taxed
by
the
state
of
washington.
we
ask
the
court
--
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
martin
p.
detels,
jr.
there
are
alternatives.
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below
on
the
ground
first
that
the
freezing
and
storing
of
these
fish
taking
place
after
they're
loaded
aboard
the
respondents'
vessels
is
an
integral
part
of
interstate
commerce
that
there
can
be
no
realistic
separation
and
we
rely
primarily
on
the
michigan-wisconsin
pipeline
case
which
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
thought
applicable.
secondly,
we
asked
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
in
practical
operation,
this
tax
discriminates
against
the
shipment
of
raw
salmon
from
alaska
for
processing
in
another
state.
thank
you.
