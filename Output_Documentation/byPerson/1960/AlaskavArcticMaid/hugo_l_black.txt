in
connection
with
the

of
the

since
this
case
began?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hasn't
been
going?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
did
that
happen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
a
territory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
--
i
think
i
understand
what
you
are
saying
in
the
orange
industry,
they
sell
frozen
orange
juice
and
they
sell
canned
orange
juice,
and
here
you
say
they
have
some
salmon
that
they
sell
frozen
and
is
freshly
on
high
price,
some
other
is
the
can,
is
that
--
are
those
two
situations
analogies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
urge
or
do
you
ask
or
do
you
take
any
position
as
to
whether
the
--
just
should
be
sent
back
to
the
state
in
some
way
or
the
construction
by
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
a
new
suit
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
all
that
was
done
according
to
the
record
as
it's
shown
that
all
that
was
done
in
the
way
of
freezing
is
within
that
line
from
headland-to-headland?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
not
done
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
--
that
wouldn't
make
an
interstate
commerce
during
the
time
that
was
--
they
are
next
to
the
last
of
it,
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
know
a
distinction
there
i
guess
as
i
gather
the
questions.
you
say
the
sales
tax
was
permissible
but
use
tax,
couldn't
it,
by
the
processor?
justice
hugo
l.

yes.
transfer
of
sales
tax
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
one
thing,
the
use
tax
for
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
would
be
to
learn.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
about
a
used
tax
on
the
boat?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
processor
--
for
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
within
the
waters.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
that
sense
i
think
that's
what
we
have
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
way
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black

say
page

justice
hugo
l.
black

there
been
any
challenge
to

justice
hugo
l.

takes
place
where?

l.
black
in
washington?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it
impose
any
--
attempt
to
impose
any
tax
on
the
freezing?

question
number
two
