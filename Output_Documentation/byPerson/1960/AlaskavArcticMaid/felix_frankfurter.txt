justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
it
exclusively
a
state
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
state
by
saying
it's
a
local
affair
and
they
give
it
a
non-commerce
significance
by
saying
it's
a
local
activity.
i
thought
all
the
cases
turn
on
that
very
controversy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
you
can
or
cannot
isolate
it
separately.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
we
don't
know
that
this
was
a
tax
on
the
--
on
the
catching
of
fish?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
this
--
is
that
a
controversy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
position
of
the
state
before
this
court
as
to
the
--
besides
incidence
of
the
tax?
what,
in
the
view
of
the
state
is
the
tax
for?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand.
that's
the
legal
theory.
but
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
so-called
what
is
the
taxable
event
in
your
view?
is
it
the
freezing
or
the
catching
or
is
it
the
fact
that
they
are
doing
something
within
the
territorial
waters
of
alaska?
justice
felix
frankfurter
anything?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you.
is
it
relevant
to
the
determination
of
the
case
before
the
court
whether
bristol
bay
is
or
is
not
within
the
territory
of
water?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
can
operate
on
the
assumption,
not
because
we
cannot
create
on
the
assumption
that
maybe
falls
geographically,
but
because
it's
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
is
that
an
agree
--
is
that
an
agreement?
is
that
an
agreement
in
both
sides?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
that's
your
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
done,
except
the
thing
in
the
case,
we
may
go
on
that
basis.
we'll
have
to
hear
what
the
appellees
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
then
it
would
be
all
a
local
activity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
there'd
be
no
problem
of
touches
interstate
commerce
except
insofar
as
an
activity
with
interstate
may
be
a
necessary
part
of
the
process
of
interstate
commerce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
wouldn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they're
intended
for
commerce
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
that's
intended
to
local
consumption.
this
is
just
the
beginning
of
a
chain
that
stretches
outside
of
alaska.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
which
will
be
good
enough,
it
would
help
me
greatly
if
you
would
state
without
arguing
to
begin
with
it
in
all
event.
if
you
would
state
the
basis,
the
facts
which
you
conceive
to
be
that
--
what
are
the
findings
or
fact
in
this
equity?
have
you
got
any
findings
or
fact?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
now,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
state
the
fact,
the
assumptions
on
the
basis
of
which
it
was
then
tend
for
certain
legal
propositions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
the
catching
is
all
local,
ergo,
it's
a
local
activity
just
sell
it
from
the
whatever
commerce
consequences
there
may
be,
being
a
local
activity
so
(inaudible)
the
state
may
impose
its
tax.
that's
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
quite
irrelevant
to
this
case
that
the
fact
that
nine
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
all
agreed
to
the
conclusion
which
you
attack
not
only
as
to
--
as
to
law
but
as
to
the
starting
point,
the
very
starting
point.
this
may
be
a
good
reason
that(inaudible)
to
say
this
like
an
alaskan
should
sit
on
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
wouldn't
you
agree
that
--
i'm
not
saying
there's
a
legal
difference,
either
all
catching
cases,
nice
discriminations
must
be
made.
but
wouldn't
you
say
extracting
ore
from
mine
is
a
more
separate
or
separable,
physically
different
as
a
transaction
or
is
more
of
a
break.
the
ores
to
be
gone
out,
it
has
to
be
--
process
things
gone
through
it,
and
thus
considerable
doing
before
it
gets
down
to
train
on
concept
that
--
that
there's
a
sale
for
the
ore.
there
might
be
glutton
market,
etcetera,
etcetera.
it's
very
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
physically
event
--
as
a
matter
of
events
of
the
difference.
i'm
not
saying
that
therefore
it
isn't
relevant.
you
have
the
right
to
--
to
go
on
it.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
those
differences,
would
you
agree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
it's
more
separable
and
it's
more
of
a
break.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they
tax
the
mining.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
the
extraction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
they
get
out
of
the
cart,
they
are
--
they
started
to
go,
don't
they?
i
mean
they're
on
the
way
that
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
--
just
as
a
matter
of
interest,
at
least
approximately
indicate
what
part
of
the
revenue
of
the
state
is
derived
from
--
immediately
derived
from
various
aspects
of
the
fishing
industry,
like
the
catching,
the
loading,
the
processing,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
the
whole
--
what
part
of
the
revenue
of
alaska
is
drawn
approximately?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
part
of
the
revenue
which
alaska
assesses
or
levies
is
imposed
on
aspect
of
the
fishing
industry
as
such
that
might
be
called
the
--
within
the
fishing
industry
like
catching,
processing,
loading,
et
cetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
less
than
20.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all,
all
of
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
meant
is
including
--
including
corporation
taxes
by
fishing
concerns.
how
much
is
derived
from
the
fishing
industry,
just
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
more
than
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
--
they're
not
subject
to
--
to
a
tax
--
to
an
apportioned
tax
or
activities
on
their
gross
receipt
or
gross
income
for
activities
that
geographically
play
their
part
within
territorial
waters?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
this
--
this
decision,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
doesn't
rule
that
question
out,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
in
--
that's
before
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
means
--
that
mean
that
on
the
existing
--
existing
legislature,
existing
tax
measures
wouldn't
have
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
mean
to
imply
the
constitution
that
nothing
could
be
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
isn't,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
state
is
just
holding
its
hand?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
discrimination
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
like
your
candor
and
things
--
you
think
this
is
a
difficult
part
of
the
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
why
you
think
so
because
four
is
less
than
six,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
if
i
understand
the
course
of
your
expositions.
if
we
had
no
testimony
at
all,
merely
have
the
legislative
in
that
4%
for
freezers
and
6%
for
canneries,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
we
just
have
that
enactment,
one
couldn't
possible
be
i
just
say
that
the
fact
that
four
less
than
six
that
six
is
more
than
four
shows
discrimination
against
the
canned
because
we
can't
think
judicial
notice
or
what
the
fact
of
the
fishing
industry
in
the
relation
of
that
problem.
are
you
suggesting
that
by
testimony,
it
was
sought
to
be
established
that
in
fact,
that
surface
discrimination
--
that
surface
justifiably
discrimination
made
by
the
legislature
is
overturned
as
a
--
as
a
--
is
(inaudible)
which
earns
and
a
showing
was
made.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
no
differentiation.
in
fact,
if
you
can
go
to
a
levied
--
so,
6%
and
against
those
who
have
to
pay
only
4%,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
--
if
the
fact
show
that,
isn't
really
a
bad
way,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
thought
when
you
said
that's
the
fact
show.
i
say
that
the
facts,
if
the
testimony
goes
to
the
proposition
that
in
fact
while
without
any
elucidation,
the
legislature
may
well
have
reasons
be
imposing
6%
on
canneries
against
4%
on
freezers.
the
testimony
shows
that
there's
no
basis
in
the
actualities
of
life
with
that
discrimination
--
with
that
distinction,
but
you
say
that
isn't
what
the
testimony
show?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
the
--
the
testimony
which
is
about
--
which
there's
controversy
is
whether
there
--
it
is
shown
that
there
is
no
difference
between
the
two
kinds
of
enterprises.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
talking
until
now
about
four
and
six,
not
four
and
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
there
are
no
attached
--
there
are
no
attached
here
on
the
basis
--
on
the
claim
of
discrimination
as
between
four
and
six?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
there's
no
claim
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
alright.
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
misunderstood
why
all
this
is
relevant
as
to
whether
this
is
episodic
or
not
between
the
four
and
the
six,
if
that's
not
challenged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
then
why
bother?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
thurlow,
before
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
proceed,
along
the
lines
or
in
connection
with
the
question
we've
just
put
to
you,
in
agreeing
with
my
brother
douglas
that
certainly,
it
is
relevant
for
the
construction
placed
by
a
state
court
as
to
what
it
is
on
which
the
state
purported
to
impose
a
tax
not
conclusive
but
it's
something
to
be
considered
at
all,
taking
those
to
--
taking
that
into
account.
i
want
to
ask
you
this
question.
you
--
you
maintained
or
the
part
which
is
involving
your
position
that
the
manner
in
which
the
statute
is
construed
in
relation
to
what
it
is
that
is
being
taxed,
what
it
is
that
if
you're
validating
taxed?
it
may
make
a
difference
how
you
construe
the
statute
as
to
what
it
is
on
which
a
tax
is
sought
to
be
imposed
using
that
it
may
make
a
difference
in
construing
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
whether
if
the
statute
opened
to
two
different
constructions
as
to
what
it
is
on
which
--
for
which
the
taxes
sought
to
be
collected.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
what
you're
urging
here
in
the
court
is
it
--
is
it
outside
of
the
realm
of
the
conceivable
that
if
this
question
came
up
before
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
alaska,
they
could
only
have
to
--
they
would
have
to
construed
only
your
way
that
there'd
be
--
as
a
compulsion
of
intellectual
honesty
that
would've
required
them?
that
can't
be
because
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
very
court
is
divided
as
between
three
or
nine,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
that
--
it
does
may
make
--
it
may
make
a
difference
as
to
how
the
statute
is
construed
regarding
what
it
is
that's
levied
it.
what
is
it
that
you
sought
to
be
levied
about,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
one
construction
may
lead
the
court
to
say
this
is
within
it,
another
construction
may
say
it's
without
it,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
that
ambiguity
in
the
statute,
resolved
one
way
by
the
district
--
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
three-judge
panel.
another
way
in
the
nine
judge
panel
and
of
course,
no
construction
at
all
from
the
supreme
court
of
alaska,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
that
state
accurately?
and
where
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
because
i
hope
that
the
--
your
brother
will
address
itself
to
that.
suppose
you
gave
answer
to
that
question
which
i
made
it
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
you
can't
answer
for
him.
i
want
him
to
answer
for
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
some
years
here
--
some
years
would
be
clearly
all
alive
so
that
--
but
--
but
no
statute
being?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
also
said
as
you
know
that
what
the
state
court
has
done,
is
illuminating
the
cast,
is
to
be
considerably
as
relevance
in
construing
what
after
all
as
often
as
not
in
the
series
of
more
or
less
complicated
or
it's
not
complicated
the
use
of
facts.
that's
also
true,
isn't'
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
particularly
the
other
way
around.
we
have
said
that
if
a
state
court
as
the
tax
is
on
--
on
a
--
uninterrupted
sale
from
one
state
to
another,
the
fact
that
a
state
court
rather
inclined
to
sustain
a
tax
for
appropriate
reasons,
if
a
state
court
find
that
a
tax
is
indeed
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
that
carries
a
lot
of
weight
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
that
there
was
a
sale
of
--
suppose
the
--
alaska
just
taxed
the
transaction
of
sale
to
the
freezer
ships,
a
lot
of
independent
fellows
pulling
up
a
lot
of
salmon
and
selling
it,
would
the
sale
tax
imposed
upon
and
concededly
whatever
they
buy
is
committed
to
interstate
commerce?
is
it
before
the
sales
tax
or
whatever
you
call
it,
use
--
i
mean
sales
tax?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
although
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
you
include
my
proposition
that
concededly
all
they
buy,
is
it
ones
committed
to
interstate
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
let's
--
the
ship
are
out
of
the
state
if
he
sends
him
to
the
territory
by
a
store
and
that
he
could
have
been
subjected
to
an
occupation
plant,
could
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
can
illustrate
how
nice
the
distinctions
are,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
think
you
--
you
would
be
pretty
clear
that
a
sales
tax
that
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest.
i
just
want
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
transferred?
justice
felix
frankfurter
within
the
water?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
just
to
go
to
this
--
this
little
cite
that
if
it
were,
i
--
i
am
assuming
that
the
sales
tax
which
i
hypothesized
wouldn't
be
imposed
not
on
the
seller
but
on
the
buyer.
would
that
make
a
difference
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
the
statutes
--
suppose
the
statute
such
as
you've
just
stated,
would
make
it
all
of
--
would
make
the
discrimination
between
freezing
and
canning
wholly
within
the
state,
no
interstate
commerce
problem.
but
on
the
phase
of
the
statute
such
a
statute
would
be
violated
of
the
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
do
we
know
from
the
--
figure
to
the
statute
--
how
do
i
know
that
nobody
could
be
more
ignorant
about
this
processing
than
i
am?
well,
how
do
i
know
merely
from
reading
to
the
statute
that
the
distinction,
the
differentiation
and
the
taxing
rate
didn't
have
some
relation
to
either
the
quality
of
the
fish
or
the
market
of
