chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
measure
your
--
how
do
you
measure
your
three
miles
there?
is
it
along
the
shore
line
or
is
from
headland-to-headland
from
the
bay?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
found
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
where
the
ships
were?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
would
you
say
that
if
the
freezer
ships
was
inside
these
territorial
waters
of
alaska
that
the
legal
issue
would
be
exactly
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
would
be.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
the
canneries
on
the
shore
that
they're
the
--
the
--
or
do
you
have
any
freezing
plants
on
the
shore?
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
they
taxed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
question
of
discrimination
in
the
amount
of
taxes
between
the
various
types?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
a
question
of
discrimination.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
tax
your
local
fishermen
who
--
who
fish
for
salmon
in
the
same
way
as
these
small
boats
do
and
then
--
and
then
come
in
to
take
it
into
alaska?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
tax
them
on
--
in
--
in
the
same
way
that
you
--
that
you
tax
ships?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
no
--
do
you
--
do
you
tax
the
fish
that
they
catch?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
thurlow,
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
if
the
--
if
the
respondents
are
successful
in
avoiding
this
tax,
will
they
be
subject
to
any
tax
either
for
their
appraising
or
for
their
catching
of
fish
in
alaska?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
taxes,
whatsoever.
this
would
--
if
they
prevail,
it
will
be
absolutely
free
from
any
--
any
taxes
either
on
the
gathering
of
the
fish
or
the
freezing
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
that
it
isn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wasn't
a
state,
yeah.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
detels.
chief
justice
earl
warren
66?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
fee?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
--
do
your
boats
pay
that
$15
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
it
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
do
pay.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
--
would
the
state
be
entitled
to
--
without
having
it
consider
discriminatory
to
have
--
have
two
different
kinds
of
taxes,
one
for
--
for
those
fishermen
who
--
who
catch
the
salmon
within
their
territorial
waters
and
who
take
them
into
the
--
into
the
shore
where
there'd
be
no
--
no
chance
of
them
getting
away
from
taxation
on
the
one
hand,
and
then,
another
type
of
taxation,
another
method
of
collecting
it
rather
for
those
who
--
who
take
a
ride
out,
out
of
the
state
without
any
processing
in
--
in
the
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
discriminatory
on
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
kind
of
tax
is
--
is
different?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
would
--
that
wasn't
my
question.
in
other
words,
they
expect
to
get
so
much
revenue
from
--
from
the
business
of
--
of
catching
fish.
would
it
make
any
difference
if
there
were
two
different
statutes
that
were
different
in
--
in
form
as
to
those
who
could
be
easily
policed
because
they
--
all
their
fish
go
to
the
canneries
inside
alaska?
and
another
type
of
statute
for
those
who
--
who
never
get
--
take
their
fish
to
shore
but
take
them
right
out
to
a
--
to
a
ship
that's
outside
of
the
territorial
waters?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let's
start
with
--
with
approximately
the
same
rate.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
--
used
of
my
understanding
to
your
answer
is
that
they
can
only
have
a
discrimination
to
the
extent
of
the
additional
cost
of
--
of
policing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
goes
beyond
that,
it
is
--
it
is
burden
on
commerce.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
the
answer
to
it.
