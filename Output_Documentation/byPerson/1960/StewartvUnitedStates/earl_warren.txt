mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap).
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
carey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
just
stating
that
stipulation
again?
i
--
i
didn't
quite
get
it,
mr.
belcher.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
went
a
little
farther
than
that
didn't
he,
the
--
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
--
i
thought
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
said
something
about,
it
is
a
fact
but
you
didn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
jury
never
heard
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
understood
--
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
belcher,
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
you
can
assume
that
because
this
question
didn't
happen
to
make
any
great
impression
on
the
judge
that
it
could
not
have
made
any
impression
on
the
jury
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
because
the
question
was
asked,
i
assume
in
audible
tone
of
voice
and
i
suppose
those
who
were
attending
to
the
particular
question.
they
could've
heard
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
maybe
the
judge
was
making
notes
or
he
may
have
--
that
his
mind
on
something
else
for
the
moment
and
that's
the
reason
he
didn't
--
he
didn't
get
the
force
of
the
question.
but
--
but
are
we
entitled
to
assume
from
that
the
--
that
the
jury
would
not
or
had
it
impress
on
their
minds?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
a
jury
knew
that
a
man
had
been
tried
twice
before
for
the
same
crime
and
the
prosecutor
asked
the
witness,
"isn't
this
the
first
time
you've
taken
the
stand?"
isn't
it
a
natural
inference
for
the
jury
that
that
prosecutor
knows
what
he's
talking
about
and
that
he
--
he
is
intending
to
convey
the
impression
that
the
man
did
not
testify
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
--
may
i
ask
the
question
along
that
same
--
same
line?
if
this
man
had
been
tried
twice
and
had
not
taken
the
stand
and
had
only
taken
it
in
this
particular
occasion
and
this
question
was
--
was
asked
after
he
had
given
the
so
called
gibberish
talk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
inference
not
be
opened
to
the
jury
quite
open
that
in
giving
that
gibberish
talk,
an
acting
as
he
was
that
he
was
a
complete
faker,
that
there
was
no
insanity
in
his
maker
and
the
fact
that
he
had
--
had
never
tried
that
before,
might
suggest
to
them
rather
strongly
that
it
was
fakery
and
therefore,
his
defense
of
insanity
was
no
good.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carey.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
carey,
i
--
i
understand
you
were
appointed
by
the
district
court
to
defend
this
man
because
he
was
an
indigent
and
your
associates,
mr.
ackerly
and
mr.
gillcrist
also.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it's
a
great
--
great
responsibility
to
defend
a
man
for
his
life
and
this
court
appreciates
very
much.
the
fact
that
lawyers
like
yourself
would
undertake
that
great
responsibility
just
as
a
public
service
and
nothing
else,
so
i
want
to
express
to
--
to
you
and
your
associates
the
--
the
appreciation
of
the
court
for
having
--
having
done
that.and
i
would
like
to
say
also
to
mr.
belcher
that
we
appreciate
the
very
frank
manner,
very
clear
manner
in
which
you
have
presented
this
matter
to
the
--
to
the
court
in
a
very
diligent
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
the
interest
of
--
of
the
government.
we
thank
both
of
you.
it's
been
a
good
argument.
