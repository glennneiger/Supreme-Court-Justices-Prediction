what
was
the
plea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
plea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
he
plead?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
plead
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity
or
does
that
and
--
did
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
pleaded
not
guilty
to
the
police.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
in
the
record,
your
opening
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
a
very
common
way
for
a
lawyer
to
get
a
fact
for
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
what
he
did.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
a
good
deal
of
kinship
between
this
question
and
a
question
in
the
civil
case
where
damage
suit
is
being
tried
against
an
individual
carrying
juror
--
the
lawyer
for
the
plaintiff
says,
do
you
have
any
insurance
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
know
of
any
states
that
don't
reverse
a
trial
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
didn't
reverse
a
trial
before
that
came
in
by
such
a
question
was
asked?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
what
other
inference,
you
say
--
if
you
say
that
it
could
be
drawn
from
it?
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
i
frankly
haven't
seen
it
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
had
he
testified
before?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
of
course
if
he
has
testified
before
and
has
generally
in
trial,
would
occur,
he
would
have
gone
on
and
asked
that
question,
you
would
have
known
that's
why
he
did
it.
but
frankly,
i
can
see
no
worthy
reason
here
except
that
you
want
to
show
me
he
had
testified.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
maybe
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
i've
had
experience
in
trials
and
jury
hadn't
and
therefore,
i
have
no
right
to
draw
there.
that
should
be
true.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
under
the
rule
of
the
district
(inaudible)
--
if
this
--
if
--
if
you
had
put
on
the
claim,
district
attorneys
had
put
on
the
claim
and
you
had
proven
that
this
man
had
been
there
twice
before
and
did
not
testify
in
his
behalf.
now,
under
the
rules
generally
followed,
would
that
had
been
given
--
could
there
have
been
a
reason
for
a
mistrial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
all
depends
on
what
is
meant
by
this
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
what
is
conveyed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you'd
had
the
same
1500
pages
that
you
have
and
on
the
same
--
at
the
same
moment,
this
question
was
asked,
you
didn't
put
the
clerk
in
the
courtroom,
and
shown
that
this
man
had
been
tried
twice
and
did
not
testify
in
his
behalf,
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
