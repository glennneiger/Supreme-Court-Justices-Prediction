what
did
the
government
argue
with
anything
in
their
summation
to
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
in
the
record?
is
--
is
the
summation
printed
in
the
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
it
isn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
summation
stenographed
before
they
transcribed?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
they
part
of
the
record
in
the
court
here,
the
unprinted
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
much
time
elapsed
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
might
have
also
considered,
it's
better
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
court
of
appeals,
if
i
understand
it,
did
not
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
jury
nor
defendant
(voice

justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
mean
they
didn't
consider
the
question
of
prejudice
or
non-prejudice.
they
said
it
was
a
permissible
piece
of
cross
examination
that
you
now
agree
it
was
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
perhaps
this
is
irrelevant
in
view
of
your
concession
but
what
was
the
theory
of
the
government
and
asked
him
this
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
does
that
mean?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
irrelevant.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
isn't
a
very
good
answer
when
you're
trading
on
a
very
sensitive
territory
as
your
own
argument
shows
you
were.
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
in
this
--
you
have
this
record
invented.
it
is
now
in
the
question
appeared.
on
the
afternoon
of
the
day,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
what
would
be
your
position?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
that's
all
argument
(inaudible)
but
i
--
i
appreciate
the
course
of
your
argument
that
after
you
get
all
through
it
is
--
you've
been
--
the
reasonable
man
who
can
argue
two
ways
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
undertake
to
say
that's
it's
demonstrable
beyond
debate
that
the
jury
couldn't
have
done
