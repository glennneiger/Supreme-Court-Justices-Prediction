mr.
carl
w.
belcher
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
has
referred
to
the
stipulation
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case
to
the
effect
that
if
there'd
be
prejudice,
then
this
was
certainly
error,
the
asking
of
this
question
was
certainly
error
so
that
the
only
questions
left
in
the
case
with
a
concession
or
two.
one,
was
there
any
prejudice
properly
arrived
at
or
even
improperly
arrived
at
by
this
jury
from
the
asking
of
this
question.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
we
agree
that
the
question
here
in
issue,
as
for
the
prosecutor,
should
not
had
been
asked
if
it
did
in
fact
have
a
prejudicial
effect
for
its
probative
value
for
the
only
purpose
for
which
it
was
logically
relevant,
namely
memory
testing,
was
hardly
sufficient
to
worth
the
incurring
of
prejudice.
i
can
say,
your
honor,
that
if
there
was
prejudice,
then
this
question
was
--
should
not
have
been
asked.
it
was
an
error
to
ask
it.
so,
that
we
have
only
the
one
question,
"was
there
prejudice?"
and
secondary
question
also,
assuming
that
there
was
some
possibility
of
prejudice
inherent
in
the
asking
of
this
question,
is
it
a
situation
that
demanded
something
less
than
a
mistrial?
namely
that
the
judge
instruct
the
jury
to
disregard
the
last
question
and
answer,
or
that
he
instruct
the
jury
that
leading
questions
are
not
evidence
of
the
facts
assumed
or
go
the
whole
way,
the
third
alternative
namely
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
fact
that
an
individual,
the
defendant
did
not
take
the
stand
and
prior
to
all
these
evidence
of
nothing.
in
any
event,
those
three
possibilities
were
open
and
the
second
question
that
is
left
in
this
case
now
is,
"if
should
one
of
those
three
other
alternatives
have
been
followed
here,"
so
that
it
would
not
be
error
to
grant
the
mistrial
--
refused
to
grant
the
mistrial
even
though
there
might
be
some
small
likelihood
of
prejudice.
at
the
outset,
if
your
honor
please,
we
say
that
here,
the
jury
never
was
in
fact
told
that
the
defendant
did
not
testify
in
the
prior
trials.
in
other
words,
that
they
--
this
jury
never
knew
that
the
defendant
had
exercised
his
privilege
of
not
testifying
in
the
prior
trial.
this
was
the
third
day,
the
afternoon
session,
the
third
day
of
a
six-day
trial
to
the
extent
that
the
brief
says,
"second
day
of
a
five-day
trial,
that
brief
is
in
error."
it
was
actually
the
third
day
of
six-day
trial.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
i
think
perhaps
the
printed
record
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
thrown
in
there.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
might
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
i
might
say
that
we
can
agree
that
at
least
there
were
agreement
of
the
parties.
there
were
three
days
after
this
one
day
in
which
the
jury
have
further
evidence
on
the
case.
coming
as
it
did,
the
question,
"this
is
the
first
--
is
--
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
gone
on
the
stand,
isn't
it
willie?"
the
question
was
never
answered
at
all.
the
witness
did
respond
but
he
did
not
respond
in
a
way
which
disclosed
that
he
had
exercised
his
privilege
in
a
prior
--
prior
trial,
because
his
answer
was,
"you
and
nobody
else
--
pardon
me."
i
am
always
the
stand,
i
am
everything.
i
then
told
you,"
was
his
answer.
so,
that
that
answer
did
not
disclose
that
he
had
failed
to
take
the
strand
--
stand
in
prior
trials.
the
argument
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
prosecutor
just
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
question
was
repeated.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
that
--
that
was
a
good
deal
later
in
a
bench
conference
and
the
jury
never
heard
it.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
jury
never
heard
it.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
and
that
of
course
is
a
good
part
of
our
argument
here
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
that
the
jury
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
didn't
hear
a
very
significant
amount
of
this
fact
that
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
calender
last
places
this
case
at
all.
we
do
not
argue
here
that
the
jury
didn't
hear
the
question.
we
say
that
from
this
question,
the
jury
could've
inferred
nothing.
number
one,
it
was
not
answered.
they
had
to
make
it
by
inference
and
the
inference
itself
was
the
leading
form
of
the
question
didn't
leave
logically
to
one
inference
as
opposed
to
another
inference.
it's
possible
for
the
jury
to
have
said
that
the
leading
form
of
the
question
by
the
prosecutor
suggest
the
fact
that
he
didn't
take
the
stand
on
the
prior
trial.
but
the
context
also
would
suggest
to
this
jury
the
equally
available
inference,
namely
that
this
prosecutor
was
trying
to
provoke
this
defendant
into
responding
in
a
way
as
to
say,
"i
did
take
the
stand
on
the
prior
trial."
so,
that
a
juror
could
not
immediately
come
to
the
inference
that
the
facts
stated
in
the
question
for
the
prosecutor
were
true
facts,
because
the
other
inference
was
equally
available.
we
say
that
the
context
of
which
this
setting
did
occur
also
shows
that
there's
no
basis
for
believing
that
this
jury
improperly
inferred
the
fact.
in
fact,
there
was
every
indication
from
the
context,
the
setting
here,
that
this
question
made
no
impression
on
the
jury.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
it
certainly
expressly
they
did
not.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
could
only
add
to
that
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
majority
opinion
went
on
two
occasions,
went
to
some
length
into
the
matter
that
this
was
a
first-degree
trial,
and
the
death
penalty
was
involved
here.
so,
that
the
extent
that
those
remarks
in
the
majority
opinion
do
go
to
the
seriousness
of
this
case.
i
think
it's
proper
to
infer
that
they
were
in
effect
considering
the
problem
of
prejudice,
and
have
at
least
by
inference
at
the
solution
that
there
was
no
prejudice.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
that
only
thing
i
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
contexts
of
these
questions
were
a
memory
testing
context.even
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
was
asking
such
questions
as,
"do
you
know
me,
your
counsel?
don't
you
know
mr.
carey,
your
counsel?"
so
that
from
that
point
on
the
question's
repetition,
we
took
a
context
of,
"do
you
know,
do
you
remember?
do
you
know
and
do
you
remember?"
and
that
went
on
at
some
length.
one
of
the
questions
was
asked
in
the
prior
trials.
question,
"have
you
ever
been
tried
for
first-degree
murder
before
this
time?"
and
he
answered,
"i
ain't
never
been
tried,
i
never
been
tried."
but
again,
i
point
out
that
is
a
memory
testing
context.
the
prosecutor
followed
right
along
with
the
memory
testing
context.
he
did
get
certain
information
from
the
appellant
on
that
subject
matter.
he
got
the
information,
for
instance,
from
a
question,
"were
you
over
there
earlier
yesterday?"
meaning,
"have
you
left
--
did
you
yesterday
leave
counsel
table
and
come
to
the
witness
stand
to
be
the
witness?"
his
answer
was,
"i
was
over
there,
yes."
and
the
question,
"you
walked
over
there
to
where
you
are
now
like
you
got
up,"
he
says.
"like
you
got
up
that
is
like
i
got
up."
and
further
question,
"where
did
you
sleep
last
night?"
answer,
"i
slept
down
to
the
jail
there."
so
that
the
prosecutor
in
testing
the
memory
of
this
witness
did
receive
answers,
and
the
prosecutor
then
came
to
the
question
which
had
been
asked
of
him
on
direct
examination
by
his
counsel.
"willie,
you
were
tried
on
two
other
occasions?"
and
he
answered,
"well,
i
don't
care
how
many
occasions,
how
many
case,
you
say
case,
i
was
on
case,
ma'am,
once
in
a
time."
it
was
at
that
point
having
gone
at
the
same
subject
matter
that
the
witness
had
previously
indicated
that
he
had
not
been
tried,
that
the
prosecutor
asked
a
question
here
in
issue.
"this
is
the
first
time
you
have
gone
on
the
stand,
isn't
it
willie?"
the
first
answer
was,
"what?"
and
then
the
witness
again
--
the
prosecutor
again
repeated
the
exact
same
question,
"this
is
the
first
time
you
have
gone
on
the
stand,
isn't
it
willie?"
the
answer,
"i
am
always
the
stand,
i'm
everything,
i
done
told
you."
mr.
smithson,
the
prosecutor,
"that
is
all."
the
witness
continued
to
talk,
"you
and
nobody
else
going
ever
to
stop
me."
and
then
the
court
injected
mr.
carey,
petitioner's
counsel
meaning,
"do
you
have
anything
or
redirect
anything
further?"
in
which
mr.
carey
responded,
"that
is
all."
the
witness
continuing
to
interject
said,
"ask
me?"
at
which
point
of
the
record
shows,
the
witness
was
excused.
have
he
left
the
witness
stand?
the
witness
having
left
the
witness
stand,
mr.
carey,
at
that
point
then
brings
up
the
beginning
of
the
ruling
here
in
issue.
he
asked,
leave
to
approach
the
bench.
he's
granted
leave
to
approach
the
bench,
and
at
the
bench
that
he
does
make
his
motion
for
the
mistrial.
that's
the
only
form
of
relief
that
he
did
request
so
that
the
setting
in
which
there
was
even
the
--
the
lead
to
request
to
go
to
the
bench
did
not
come
out
of
it
a
normal
context.
there
was
nothing
in
that
setting
would
call
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
the
fact
that
they
should
think
back
to
the
last
question
and
--
other
prosecutor
and
tried
to
figure
out
if
there
was
anything
they
should
draw
from
it
because
the
proceedings
had
terminated
in
a
very
normal
fashion.
the
witness
having
come
from
the
witness
stand,
then
there
was
this
normal
request
of
--
for
leave
to
go
to
the
bench
for
a
conference.
also,
we
might
point
out,
your
honors
that
the
court
here,
the
district
court,
we
think
also
viewed
the
matter
in
the
context
of
a
memory
testing
situation.
the
court
didn't
say,
"i
didn't
hear
that
question
or
i
haven't
heard
any
questions.
i
didn't
hear
the
last
question."
the
court
said,
"he
didn't
say
that,"
meaning
that
the
court
was,
to
me
at
least,
and
where
the
court
has
been
alert,
they've
been
thinking
in
terms
of
the
"do
you
remember"
type
of
question
and
had
lost
its
focus
--
his
focus
on
the
content
or
the
subject
matter
of
the
question,
focusing
only
on
the
memory
testing
aspect,
"do
you
remember?"
we
think
also
here
that
the
lack
of
impact
on
this
jury
is
demonstrated
by
the
actions
of
defense
counsel.
he
made
his
request
for
mistrial
and
he
left
the
matter
rest.
he
did
not
do
anything
which
would
have
brought
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
jury.
for
instance,
he
did
not
even
ask
for
the
minimum
relief
but
if
your
honor
please,
instructed
the
jury
simply
in
terms
of,
"please
strike
the
last
question
and
answer
from
your
minds
and
disregard
it,"
which
would
not
have
refreshed
as
the
subject
matter.
but
those
who
--
jurors
who
did
remember
would've
been
told
to
forget
it,
he
did
not
ask
for
that.
so
we
think
that
he
made
a
decision,
the
record
would
indicate
that
he
made
the
decision
at
that
time.
number
one,
the
jury
--
this
has
made
no
impact
on
this
jury,
and
number
two,
i
don't
want
to
do
anything
which
will
make
--
give
it
an
impact.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
the
theory
of
the
government
insofar
as
the
prosecutor
had
a
conscious
motive,
i'm
sure
was
pretty
much
as
he
expressed
it.
namely,
i
think
the
jury
is
entitled
to
know.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
--
it
has
the
aspects
there
of
being
a
type
of
standard
answer
for
a
prosecutor.
if
he
has
no
specific
case
rule,
law
or
theory
in
mind,
a
good
way
to
respond
is
i
think
they're
entitled
to
know.
now,
that
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
maybe
the
answer
here.
there
may
not
be
the
answer
here.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor,
that's
true.
and
we
can
only
say
here
that
the
jury
didn't
hear
this
matter.
we
think
that
the
case
would
be
significantly
different
if
the
jury
had
head
what
the
prosecutor
had
to
say,
and
that
they
heard
indeed
any
conversation
about
the
last
question
and
answer.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
think
your
honor
that
insofar
as
they
have
a
purpose
on
occasion,
it
might
be
a
very
general
purpose,
namely
i'm
going
to
trip
him
up
if
i
can.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
and
then
this
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
we
--
willing
to
concede
the
jury
heard
it,
so
as
far
as
the
matter
of
they're
being
audible
to
jury
--
yes,
we
concede
that
it
was
audible.
our
question
here
--
the
--
the
gap
here
that
i'm
directing
my
attention
to
is
that
there
was
no
answer
to
this
question.
so
that
our
--
our
first
problem,
the
first
problem
is
petitioner
has
to
get
over
here,
what
should
we
infer?
can
you
infer?
and
i
think
he
is
essential
to
his
case
that
you
reach
the
inference
that
this
jury
inferred
the
truth
of
the
matter,
namely
that
in
prior
trial
says
petitioner,
had
not
taken
a
stand
because
the
information
was
never
given
--
given
it
to
him
--
given
to
them
in
any
concise
form.
they
had
to
reach
that
inference.
and
we
suggest
that
he
cannot
overcome
this
hurdle
which
he
hasn't
faced
out
it.
namely,
to
show
from
the
context
that
when
the
jury
responded
--
the
judge
responded
and
the
way
he
himself
conducted
himself,
he
cannot
overcome
that
hurdle
to
make
this
inference
that
although
the
jury
heard
it,
they
inferred
the
truth
of
the
matter,
namely
that
this
petitioner
had
not
taken
the
stand
in
the
prior
trial.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
it
might
and
i
--
i
would
agree.
in
--
in
a
normal
setting,
it
would
be
a
very
logical
inference
that
the
jury
would
follow
the
leading
form
of
a
prosecutor's
question.
but
this
--
this
situation
was
very,
very
unique.
this
witness
was
claiming
to
be
incompetent,
and
he
was
being
testing
with
a
series
of
"do
you
recall
and
do
you
remember"
questions.
and
he
was
not
--
it
was
--
it
was
a
situation
where
i
think
it
was
obvious
to
everyone
in
the
courtroom,
the
prosecutor
is
trying
to
get
this
witness
to
elucidate
the
fact
that
he
is
not
incompetent.
he
is
--
he
is
trying
to
cover
up.
in
that
setting,
the
jury
would
--
equally
with
the
inference
that
the
prosecutor
has
fed
this
witness
the
truth
in
his
question,
the
inference
would
equally
lie
to
the
jury
that
the
prosecutor
has
fed
him
a
mistruth
waiving
to
see
or
trying
to
get
the
witness
to
spit
it
out.
in
other
words,
to
say
that,
"no,
sir,
i
took
the
stand
in
a
prior
trial."
so
that
we
think
that
in
the
unique
setting
of
this
case,
the
inference
that
i
last
described
flows
equally
well
with
the
inference
which
didn't
come
forth.
if
your
honor
please,
assuming
that
the
information
was
inferred
by
the
jury
that
in
the
prior
trials,
this
witness,
the
petitioner
had
not
in
fact
taken
the
stand.
we
point
out
that
this
case
is
further
unique
and
that
there
was
no
comment
on
this
matter,
there
were
no
instructions
on
this
matter,
there
was
no
disruption
of
the
trial
proceedings
at
all
even
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
the
stand.
so
that
here,
the
only
the
thing
that
we
have
is
simply
the
bare
knowledge,
if
the
jury
inferred
it.
all
they
had
was
to
bare
knowledge
that
this
witness
had
failed
--
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
take
the
stand
in
the
prior
trial.
we
think
that
the
fact
of
the
bare
knowledge
is
not
something
which
in
and
of
itself
is
prejudicial.
it
takes
in
addition
to
the
bare
knowledge
of
the
fact,
it
takes
some
suggestions
somewhere
that
the
jury
should
take
that
bare
bit
of
knowledge
and
make
some
adverse
inference
from
a
second
inference.
namely,
the
usual
inference
is
that
if
he
hadn't
been
guilty,
he
would've
the
jurors
in
the
other
trials
that
he
was
not
guilty.
he
would've
taken
the
stand
and
told
them
if
he
hadn't
been
guilty,
that's
the
usual
inference.
but
from
the
bare
fact
here,
the
jury
wouldn't
be
stimulated
to
make
that
second
inference,
because
it
doesn't
come
in
a
setting
in
which
the
adverse
inference
is
elicited
from
the
jury.
they
would
had
to
reach
the
fact
itself
by
inference
and
to
reach
the
problem
of
making
it
--
feed
into
an
adverse
situation,
they
would've
had
to
place
the
second
inference
in
the
series.
assuming,
your
honor
please,
that
this
jury
did
make
both
inferences.
an
inference
indeed
on
top
of
an
inference,
we
still
say
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
this
information
viewed
by
the
jury
and
viewed
by
the
jury
in
an
adverse
light
that
is
a
headed
desire.
he
used
it
adversely
to
this
petitioner
could
have
in
fact
used
it
to
resolve
any
of
the
issues
which
were
before
them
in
this
trial.
this
case
is
not
the
usual
case
in
which
the
commission
of
the
acts
charged
was
really
an
issue
for
the
jury.
the
facts
of
this
crime
have
been
twice
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
even
though
the
cases
were
reversed,
the
court
writing
the
opinions
in
the
two
prior
cases
has
gone
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
the
facts
of
the
crime,
the
commission
of
the
acts
constituting
the
crime
in
this
case
were
almost
incontestable.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
indeed,
they've
never
been
contested.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
is
very
true
and
your
honor,
those
words
that
you
have
used
to
place
your
question
to
me
were
stated
if
i
recall
correctly
by
petitioner
counsel.
and
either
a
statement
to
the
jury
or
the
court,
i
don't
recall
exactly
which
but
i
can
recall
quite
vividly
on
one
occasion,
he
himself
said,
"we
have
only
the
one
defense
in
sanity."
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
that's
exactly
the
government's
position
that
it
could
not
have
been
used
at
all,
certainly
not
an
information
of
the
crime,
because
that
issue
is
not
here
before
this
jury.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
exactly
in
that
area,
i
think
your
honor,
must
be
the
question
of
prejudice
in
this
case.i
--
i
think
it
cannot
lie
in
any
other
error
--
area.
and
in
answer
to
that,
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
it
--
it's
--
it
comes
down
to
simply
this.
this
jury
didn't
know
what
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
namely
that
the
competency
in
--
of
this
individual
had
been
tested
just
prior
to
this
trial.
he'd
been
declared
competent
and
he'd
been
declared
the
malingerer
by
the
trial
court
as
upon
the
fact.
jury
didn't
know
that.
they
had
an
individual
before
him
who
put
on
this
act
that
is
involved
here,
so
that
the
jury
had
before
it
a
man
by
his
action
saying
--
i
mean
competent,
i'm
just
--
i
just
can't
answer
--
formulate
answers
to
questions.
and
the
additional
information
that
at
prior
trials,
he
had
not
taken
a
stand,
so
that
the
jury
had
before
frankly
the
proposition
that
the
man
has
been
acting
inconsistently,
he
took
the
stand
before,
he
does
--
he
didn't
take
it
before,
he
does
take
it
now.
one
way
to
solve
that
is
that
the
jury
says,
"inconsistency
is
the
whole
mark
of
the
type
of
man
which
he
has
been
displaying
to
us,
namely
a
man
which
is
not
capable
of
any
rational
act.
so
that
here,
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
jury
to
reach
any
satisfactory
solution
to
whether
the
man
was
competent
or
not,
it's
--
it's
an
inference
we
think
which
close
normally
from
either.
the
jury
has
to
decide
from
some
fact
other
than
this
fact,
because
the
jury
can't
say,
go
through
the
usual
rationale
that
he
would
have
the
prior
jury
he
was
not
guilty
if
he
wasn't
guilty
because
here,
the
thing
that
breaks
that
line
of
thought
is
that
we
don't
have
a
rational
man
operating.
he
tells
us
he's
not
a
rational
man,
thus
we
cannot
attribute
to
him
the
rationality
that
he
would've
told
the
jury
he
was
innocent
if
he
wasn't
guilty.
the
rationality
or
the
alleged
irrationality
of
this
man
breaks
it
so
that
jury
could
not
come
to
the
conclusion
while
he
would've
told
the
prior
jurors
that
he
was
innocent,
but
for
the
fact
that
he's
guilty.
the
jury
in
this
case
did
have
to
resolve
that
issue.
they
had
this
witness
before
him,
who
was
putting
on
emissivity
of
evidence
and
the
jury
was
attracted
to
that,
they
no
doubt
had
the
question
and
the
forefront
of
those
thinking.
is
he
telling
the
truth
that
when
he
acts
crazy
or
is
he
not
telling
the
truth
when
he
acts
crazy?
so
that
here,
the
jury,
in
resolving
that
question
would've
had
to
drawn
or
what
actually
constituted
the
whole
of
the
last
three
days
of
this
trial,
because
that
issue
of
whether
or
not
he's
competent
to
stay
in
trial,
and
whether
or
not
--
indeed,
he
was
putting
an
act
before
this
jury,
was
a
subject
of
much
proof
and
many
witnesses
during
the
remaining
days
of
this
trial.
and
it
would
be
on
the
basis
of
this
proof
that
the
jury
would
reach
the
answer
to
what
was
the
question,
perhaps
in
the
forefront
of
their
thinking,
namely
is
he
competent
or
is
he
putting
on
an
act.
from
that
question,
they
could
answer.
and
once
they
have
answered
that
question,
then
they
could
perhaps
answer
the
problem
of
whether
he
would've
taken
the
stand
in
prior
trial
but
with
the
fact
that
he
was
guilty.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
government
had
four
experts,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
for
the
defendant,
just
one
expert
and
that
expert
did
not
testify
on
the
basis
of
his
own
knowledge.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
he
had
to
be
assisted
by
hypothetical
question
to
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
test
--
his
actions
in
the
prior
two
trials
is
on
the
subject
whether
he
testified
or
did
not
testify
is
not
referred
to.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
but
the
chronology
informed
of
time
from
the
time
of
the
crime
and
dates
which
would
correspond
to
the
first
trial
and
dates
which
would
correspond
to
the
trial
and
then
to
the
third.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no
reference
to
this,
no.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
was
--
it
was
not.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no.
not
--
not
the
subject
now
of
whether
or
not
this
man
testified
in
impertinent.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
facts
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
because
the
man
of
course
didn't
take
the
stand
and
there
was
nothing
from
his
demeanor,
from
the
witness
stand
that
they
could've
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
your
honor.
i
know
of
no
such
information
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
recall
of
no
such
testimony,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
your
honor
i
can
say
that
as
far
as
reference
to
the
matter
of
prior
taking
of
the
stand
or
not
taking
the
stand,
it
didn't
come
into
this
trial
before
the
question
here
asked
for
the
prosecutor.
it
never
came
into
this
trial
again
after
this
question,
asked
by
the
prosecutor.(voice
overlap)
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
except
that
it
relates
only
in
the
context
in
which
he
came,
namely,
"do
you
recall,
do
you
recall,
do
you
remember?"
that's
the
only
way
that
it
has
into
this
trial
at
all.
but
if
your
honor
please,
the
juries
having
these
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
at
no
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
you're
correct,
your
honor
and
in
so
answering,
i'm
speaking
directly
with
the
--
the
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
even
though
they
reversed,
they
said,
"this
evidence
is
overwhelming,
it's
practically
uncontested."
so
the
only
issue
left
was
the
question
of
mental
competency.
it's
not
mental
competency
but
sanity
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
as
we
say,
the
question
of
competency
whether
this
man
was
malingering
or
whether
he
was
not
--
was
gone
into
a
great
length
before
the
jurors,
by
the
experts
and
to
lay
witnesses
as
to
whether
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial.
so
the
jury
had
all
of
that
massive
bit
of
information
in
which
to
solve
that
answer.
once
they
had
solved
that
answer
whether
he
was
malingering
--
malingering
or
whether
he
was
indeed
a
witness
that
was
incompetent,
then
they
had
the
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
man
had
tried
to
pull
a
fraud
before
their
very
eyes
and
if
they
answered
that
question
as
--
i
think
the
record
would
dictate,
they
almost
had
to
answer,
namely
that
this
man
was
malingering
on
the
witness
stand
then
they
knew
that
the
petitioner
had
tried
to
pull
a
fraud
and
in
that
setting
which
we
think,
the
jury
would
been
very
much
impressed
with.
the
question
that
the
prosecutor
had
asked
three
days
previously
had
lost
all
of
its
significance
because
in
a
setting
which
the
jurors
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
petitioner
had
tried
to
fool
them,
they
would
not
worry
of
what
--
with
what
we
think
takes
at
least
two
inferences
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
this
man
would've
told
prior
jurors
that
he
was
innocent
if
in
fact
he
had
not
been
guilty.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
have
overstated
it.
my
point
is
simply
that
the
burden
of
the
evidence
on
this
issue
of
compensate
to
testify
was
certainly
one
sided
in
favor
of
the
fact
that
he
was
competent
to
stay
in
trial.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
eight
years.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
sir.
it
does.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
your
honor.
this
--
this
is
--
there
are
cases
of
some
length
in
our
history
but
this
is
longer
than
any
i'm
aware
of.
the
panel
point
that
the
government
makes,
your
honor
--
assuming
that
the
jurors
could
someway
--
we
haven't
been
able
to
figure
it
out
but
if
there'd
be
some
way
in
which
this
jury
could
have
used
the
information
to
a
prejudice
to
this
petition,
then
we
say
that
the
situation
is
a
very
attenuated
one,
remote
impossibilities
and
we
say
that
in
situations
such
as
that,
even
though
this
be
a
capital
cases
and
death
case
that
the
usual
rules
are
called
into
play
here,
namely
that
it
becomes
a
duty
in
certain
circumstances
that
there
be
a
request
for
something
less
than
a
mistrial.
that
here
under
these
circumstances,
a
mistrial
is
not
called
for
that
there
were
three
possibilities
that
were
available
which
would've
covered
a
wide
spectrum
of
relief,
that
would
have
satisfied
the
situation.
if
petitioner's
counsel
didn't
want
to
renew
the
subject
matter
in
matter
to
this
jury,
he
had
it
within
in
his
command
to
simply
say
to
the
court,
"ask
--
tell
the
jury
to
disregard
the
last
question
and
the
last
answer,
not
tell
what
the
last
question
was
or
what
the
last
answer
was
but
tell
the
jury
to
disregard
the
last
question
and
the
last
answer."
we
think
that
would
obsess
by
the
situation.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
your
honor
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
this
case
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
this
case
is
different,
for
the
very
significant
reason
that
the
matter
to
the
matter
that
this
man
did
not
take
a
stand
and
his
prior
trial
was
never
put
before
this
jury
as
a
fact.
they
had
--
they
could
reach
it
by
inference.
they
could
reach
through
the
leading
form
of
the
question.
if
they
went
through
a
process
of
reasoning
which
we
don't
think
was
likely
in
the
setting
which
was
matter
was
asked.
but
coming
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
that's
true.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
right.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
and
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
you
honor
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
we
--
we
view
the
matter
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
if
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
if
the
motive
of
this
prosecutor
came
through
to
this
jury,
then
certainly,
this
jury
is
going
to
make
all
of
the
inferences
that
i
say
they
won't
--
wouldn't
make.
but
here,
the
motive
of
the
prosecutor,
we
submit,
just
didn't
come
through.
the
--
the
statement
which
he
made
to
the
court
was
made
at
a
(inaudible)
out
in
the
hearing
of
this
jury.
so
that
the
jury
would
have
to
view
this
matter
in
its
context,
not
that
the
prosecutor
was
trying
to
get
subject
matter
across
through
them
but
the
prosecutor
was
trying
to
trip
this
witness
--
petitioner
up
and
make
him
reveal
he
knew
something.
and
in
that
context,
the
jury
could
equally
come
to
the
proposition
that
the
prosecutor
was
misfeeding
information
or
feeding
bad
facts
for
this
man
hoping
that
the
witness
would
spit
those
facts
out.
in
fact
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
your
honor.
i
--
i
know
the
situation
your
honor
describes
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
sir.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
i
know
--
i
know
of
no
--
know
of
no
such
state
but
the
--
the
proposition
there
is
susceptible,
we
think
of
only
one
answer
and
that
is
that
it
makes
a
difference
to
ask
the
jurors
how
we're
going
to
resolve
this
case.
but
here,
the
jury
first
asked
to
come
--
overcome
this
equally
--
well,
we
think
it's
an
equally
balanced
proposition.
they
have
to
overcome
the
answer
while
the
prosecutor
is
--
is
trying
to
give
this
man
something
that
he
will
reject,
that
he
will
turn
back
in
the
prosecutor's
place.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
the
inference
that
the
prosecutor
was
feeding
bad
information
to
the
petitioner,
hoping
as
a
last
resort
that
this
petitioner
would
disclose
what
in
fact
was
true,
namely
that
the
man
did
testify
in
his
prior
two
trials
and
that
he
was
trying
to
get
the
witness
to
telling
that
he
had
in
fact
testified
in
the
prior
two
trial.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
no,
but
the
jury
didn't
know
that.
so
that
in
taking
the
leading
form
of
this
question
and
trying
to
analyze
it
as
to
whether
the
man
did
or
did
not
take
the
stand
in
the
prior
trial.
the
jury
had
an
equally
balanced
situation.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
as
i
say
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
as
we
view
the
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
jury
here
would,
i
think,
have
been
very
sympathetic
with
the
proposition
that
they
tried
to
trip
this
witness
up
by
feeding
him
bad
information.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
your
honor,
the
usual
practice
would
be
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well
here,
there
was
a
--
a
very
critical
thing,
"shall
we
open
this
matter
backed
up
in
the
minds
of
the
jury?
should
we
just
leave
it
like
it
is,
which
we
think
is
better?"
namely,
that
the
jury
made
no
impact
on
the
jury,
leave
it
with
no
impact
to
the
jury.
impasse
it
that
it
has
no
way
of
which
it
can
affect
this
trial,
that's
the
government's
position
here.
if
that
be
the
situation,
then
it
certainly
was
not
error
for
this
judge
sua
sponte
to
think
it's
--
itself
about
the
other
forms
of
relief.
only
district
court
here
would've
had
to
have
done
in
analyzing
the
question
whether
to
inject
itself
and
to
the
case
at
that
point
and
suggest
two
counsel
forms
of
relief,
was
to
think,
"should
i
or
am
i
permitted
to
infer
that
the
jury
will
know
that
they
are
not
to
assume
the
truth
of
the
facts
stated
in
--
in
leading
questions?"
that
we
think
that
it's
not
such
an
unreasonable
situation
for
--
to
assume
if
the
district
court
could
say,
"well,
this
jury
is
going
to
know
that
those
facts
and
--
assumed
in
this
question
here
or
not
true
facts
and
if
they
have
no
firm
fact
in
which
they
can
proceed
to
do
speculating.
in
that
setting,
we
think
that
there
was
no
duty
on
the
district
court
to
itself
act
in
the
situation
and
indeed,
it
properly
did
what
it
did
here,
namely
to
rely
to
a
large
degree.it
did
in
fact
to
rely
in
totally
on
defense
counsel
and
defense
counsel's
analysis
of
the
situation.
if
he
though
it
made
no
impact,
in
other
words
the
district
court
assuming
to
pass
counsel,
ask
for
a
new
trial,
and
if
he
can't
get
a
new
trial,
he
want
this
trial
left
just
like
it
is.
the
district
court
judge
can,
i
think
in
this
situation,
rely
upon
that
analysis
of
petitioner's
counsel.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
didn't
indicate
it
was
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
correct
and
in
answer
to
your
honor's
last
question,
he
didn't
indicate
that
he
would
deny
or
look
with
this
favor
on
any
other
form
of
relief
other
than
the
mistrial.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
but
this
read
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
is
a
very
standard
practice
of
the
jurors,
almost
after
the
first
day,
know
when
the
--
what
the
judge
means
by
the
admonition,
namely
not
to
talk
about
the
case
stand.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
even
for
a
very
short
recess,
recall
my
last
admonition,
don't
forget
what
i
told
you
at
the
end
--
onset
of
this
trial
in
such
remark
because
i
had
to
renew
that
thing.
for
the
reason
stated,
your
honor
please,
we
respectfully
submit
the
judgement
of
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
it
clearly
would.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct.
in
other
words
--
actually,
i
think
the
situation
falls
within
the
concession
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case.
in
effect
that
if
any
way
that
the
jury
could've
used
this
question
to
have
resolved
any
of
the
issues
in
this
case,
then
it
was
an
improper
question
because
the
benefit
to
the
government
was
practically
negligible,
the
damage
or
the
possible
danger
to
the
man
himself
was
great.
so
that
in
a
situation
such
as
that,
we
concede
that
it
should
not
have
been
error,
asked
that
it
was
error
to
ask
him
that
the
problem
here
are
just
two-fold.
is
there
any
way
--
number
one,
is
there
any
way
that
this
question
could've
been
used
by
this
jury
to
have
resolved
it,
and
subsidiary
to
that,
of
course
we
--
we
point
out
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
wasn't
known
to
the
jury
and
had
to
infer
the
matter
and
that
the
setting
just
wasn't
conducing
to
the
inference
that
there
was
never
any
comment.
all
they
would've
known
was
the
bare
fact.
but
even
if
they
had
gone
to
that
extent
--
even
if
they
had
known
for
instance
that
they
were
supposed
to
have
used
the
inference
they
had
arrived
at
in
some
way
adverse
to
this
man,
there
were
just
no
way
that
they
could've
used
it
here
to
resolve
the
issues
that
they
have
before
them.
if
they
could,
then
we
concede
the
question
should
not
been
asked.
it
was
error
to
do
so
and
should
be
reversed.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
our
position
would
be
altered
in
some
degree,
but
of
course,
our
--
our
basic
argument
still
has
to
be
the
same
that
even
if
this
was
the
last
question
that
the
jury
had
heard,
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
with
it.
they
just
didn't
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
we
think
in
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
well,
the
only
--
the
only
way
we
can
really
say
that,
if
your
honor
please,
is
--
is
the
nature
of
the
peculiar
facts
in
this
case.
they
had
an
issue
here
which
this
case
really
didn't
help
them
to
solve.
the
basic
question
comes
down
to
the
problems
of
whether
or
not
the
matter
of
a
prior
failure
to
take
a
stand
helps
in
any
way
elucidates,
in
any
way
helps
anyone
to
determine
whether
a
man
is
competent,
presently
on
the
stand
or
not.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
(voice
overlap)
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
that
there
just
known
union
between
those
two
propositions,
failure
to
take
a
stand
and
incompetency
witness
that
the
record
is
big,
that
this
issue
was
gone
into
for
the
next
three
days
of
trial
and
practical
effect
so
that
the
jury
just
--
it
--
we
think
it's
reasonable
to
say
that
on
this
record,
this
one
question
coming
on
the
third
afternoon
of
the
third
day
of
a
six-day
trial
in
which
these
peculiar
facts
were
given
so
much
attention
by
experts
and
lay
witness
day
after
day
for
the
next
three
days,
that
this
matter
unanswered.
this
question
being
unanswered
as
it
is,
could've
--
had
no
effect.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
how
the
--
within
our
concessions,
your
honors,
that
this
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
this
jury
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
practically
asked
and
there
was
--
now
we're
into
the
--
the
man
to
the
prosecutor
type
thing.
the
jury
is
practically
impelled
to
use
that
bit
of
information
but
it's
not
this
case
because
--
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
--
because
they
didn't
know
the
fact
involved,
because
the
setting
was
such
that
there
was
no
adverse
connotation
put
on
it.
it
was
one
of
a
series
of
memory
testing
questions.
and
then
as
we
say,
even
if
they
did
have
it,
the
jury
would
--
well,
they
would
have
to
improperly
use
this
matter
because
there
was
no
proper
way
that
they
could
use
it.
and
they
had
come
even
to
use
it
improperly,
they
come
right
up
to
the
problem
of,
"was
he
competent
when
he
didn't
take
the
stand
or
not?"
and
that
was
the
big
question
on
which
they
had
their
evidence
for
the
next
three
days.
for
this
reason,
we
submit
the
judgments
of
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
carl
w.
belcher
thank
you.
