mr.
edward
l.
carey
may
it
please
the
court.
willie
lee
stewart
has
been
tried
for
first-degree
murder
on
three
different
occasions
in
the
district
of
columbia.
the
first-degree
murder
conviction,
as
you
gentlemen
know,
carries
with
it
the
mandatory
death
penalty.
on
the
prior
two
occasions,
when
he
was
tried
and
convicted,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
reversed
for
two
different
reasons.
the
third
time
he
was
tried,
willie
lee
stewart
took
the
witness
stand.
in
prior
two
trials,
he
did
not
take
the
witness
stand.
after
we
had
concluded
our
direct
examination
of
the
appellant,
the
prosecutor
then
began
to
cross-examine.
during
the
course
of
such
examination,
the
prosecutor
secured
no
information
or
no
effect
of
cross-examination
from
the
appellant.
he
said
to
the
appellant,
he's
about
to
conclude
his
cross-examination,
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
taken
stand,
isn't
it,
willie?"
willie
says
"what?"
the
prosecutor
then
again
said,
"this
is
the
first
time
you
have
taken
the
stand."
he
then
concluded
his
cross-examination,
he
then
approached
to
bench
and
asked
for
a
mistrial.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
"i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about."
these
are
words
to
that
effect,
your
honor.
he
didn't
--
at
the
first
time
he
said,
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
gone
on
the
stand,
isn't
it,
willie?"
i'm
quoting
now
from
page
140
of
the
record.
answer
-
"what?"
question
-
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
gone
on
the
stand,
isn't
it,
willie?"
answer
-
"i
am
always
the
stand;
i'm
everything;
i
done
told
you."
that
was
the
limit
of
the
answer
to
the
question.
at
the
bench
when
we
asked
for
a
mistrial,
we
contended,
the
prosecutor
had
brought
before
the
jury
the
fact
that
this
man
had
not
taken
the
stand
on
two
prior
occasions.
we
contended
that
the
jury
was
not
entitled
to
know
that.
our
contention
was
that
this
man
was
exercising
a
constitutional
right
and
a
statutory
right
not
to
take
the
stand.
our
motion
for
a
mistrial
was
denied.
we
renewed
the
motion
at
the
completion
of
the
trial.
we
further
made
it
the
basis
for
a
new
trial.
we
contend
by
such
representation
by
the
prosecutor
--
this
is
more
than
a
question.
this
is
a
representation
or
an
assertion
by
the
prosecutor.
he
said,
"this
is
the
first
time
you
have
taken
the
stand."
he
stated
it
as
a
fact,
and
at
the
time
we
made
the
objection
at
the
bench,
the
prosecutor
said
to
judge
letts,
"this
is
a
fact
that
the
jury
should
know."
the
fact
is
or
the
fact
to
which
he
was
referring
was
the
fact
that
this
man
had
not
taken
the
stand.
we
now
contend
that
this
man
hadn't
exercised
his
constitutional
right.
the
jury
should
not
have
been
told
of
the
fact
that
he
had
exercised
such
constitutional
right
on
two
prior
occasions,
because
of
that
to
be
true,
it
makes
a
mockery
of
a
constitutional
right
to
take
the
stand
or
not
take
the
stand.
we
further
contend
to
this
court
that
that
representation
by
the
prosecutor
not
only
breached
or
invaded
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellant
and
further
suggested
to
the
jury
that
this
remark
is
susceptible
of
another
meaning.
this
jury
then
was
--
it
was
suggested
to
this
jury
not
only
that
this
man
not
take
the
stand
on
two
prior
occasions
when
he
was
tried
for
first-degree
murder
but
he
might
have
been
tried
for
other
crimes
in
which
time
he
never
took
the
stand.
we
think
it's
a
strong
susceptibility
of
interpretation
by
the
jury
that
not
only
was
this
man
a
murderer
as
alleged
in
the
indictment,
but
also
had
a
criminal
record
and
was
tried
for
other
crimes
and
at
no
time
that
he
ever
taken
the
stand.
we
argued
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
asserted
by
a
5:4
decision,
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court,
and
said
that
when
this
man
took
the
stand,
this
became
part
of
what
had
they
--
interpreter
called
"demeanor
evidence."
demeanor-evidence,
they
contended
them,
fell
within
the
raffel
decision
handed
down
by
this
court
and
that
there
was
an
inconsistency,
and
if
the
question
was
relevant
and
competent,
then
the
prosecutor
has
a
right
to
ask
this
question.
we
contend
as
we
did
then,
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
his
taking
the
stand
of
the
third
trial
and
has
not
taken
the
stand
on
the
two
prior
occasions.
where
is
the
inconsistency?
if
he
had
told
a
different
story
when
he
had
taken
the
stand,
either
the
first
or
second
trial
and
gave
a
different
story
at
the
third
trial,
there
would
be
an
inconsistency.
but
how
can
you
draw
an
inconsistency
between
his
taking
the
stand
and
giving
gibberish
answers
or
indulging
a
meaningless
behavior
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit
said,
"because
you
cannot
contrast
his
taking
the
stand
with
nothing
when
he
wasn't
on
the
stand
on
the
two
prior
occasions."
mr.
edward
l.
carey
the
prosecutor
said
this.
he
said,
"you
heard
it"
and
i'm
trying
to
give
it
in
substance,
mr.
justice
harlan.
he
said,
"you
heard
the
defendant
testify."
and
he
said,
his
testimony
amounted
to
“the
whole
sum
of
nothing.”
mr.
edward
l.
carey
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
(inaudible)
i
don't
think
it
is
your
honor,
but
i
can
recall
it
very
specifically.
he
said
as
"the
whole
sum
of
nothing."
so
we
contend,
and
as
we
did
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
case
did
not
fall
within
the
raffel
case.
there
is
no
inconsistency.
the
question
had
no
relevancy
or
competency.
it
didn't
go
to
its
credibility.
he
didn't
deny
or
he
didn't
affirm
killing
the
decedent.
in
fact
justice
burger
identified
his
behavior
as
bizarre.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
substantially
the
defense
was
insanity,
mr.
justice
harlan.
in
fact,
i
think
all
of
the
judges
who
reviewed
this
case
have
concluded
that
factually,
there
was
no
defense
because
you
had
eye
witnesses,
you
had
a
ballistic
expert,
and
you
had
a
fingerprint
expert.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
no.
it
was
insanity,
i
--
almost
in
total,
i
suppose,
it
would
be
a
better
expression
to
use,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
well,
i
won't
exclude
the
fact
that
we
did
cross-examine
some
of
the
government
witnesses.
we
cross-examined
the
daughter
of
the
decedent,
at
least
at
the
third
trial.
we
weren't
involved
in
the
first
and
second
trial.
and
i
think
anytime
you'd
cross-examine
a
witness,
you
do
create
--
attempt
to
create
some
doubt
of
facts.
now,
it
maybe
in
minimal
factual
defense
but
i
think
there
was
a
factual
defense.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
your
honor,
at
the
third
trial
--
the
mother
had
died
between
the
second
and
third
trial.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes
she
was,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
it
was
an
intent
--
mr.
edward
l.
carey
i
would
say
in
answer
to
that,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that's
right.
but
just
--
justice
whittaker
asked
me
if
there's
any
factual
defense.
i
think
if
i'd
say,
there
was
none,
it'd
be
quite
inaccurate,
because
i
think
when
you
cross-examine,
you
do
indicate
some
doubt
insofar
as
the
witness's
credibility
is
concerned.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct.
we
all
--
mr.
edward
l.
carey
well,
i
think
too,
we
probably
were
allowed
a
rather
--
wide
gamut
under
the
first-degree
murder,
i
think
that's
generally
true
because
--
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct
because
if
they
give
you
supinely
stop
and
accept
the
testimony
as
verbatim,
then
i
think
you
might
just
--
we
will
not
go
in
the
courtroom.
and
i
think
there's
some
serious
questions
as
to
whether
these
people,
everything
they
said
might
have
been
totally
correct.
i
think
substantially
what
they
said
was
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
what
is
that
your
honor?
mr.
edward
l.
carey
the
plea?
mr.
edward
l.
carey
not
guilty.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
here,
you
enter
a
general
plea.
it's
not
a
specific
plea.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that's
right,
mr.
--
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
insanity
primarily.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
if
our
position
was
--
mr.
edward
l.
carey
i
don't
think
it
is,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes
they
are,
mr.
justice
harlan.
see
our
position
was
that
under
the
durham
rule,
and
my
defense
was
that
this
man
was
a
mental
defect.
he
didn't
--
had
an
intelligence
quotient
of
65.
we
contend
that
under
the
durham
rule
that
there
was
a
cause
of
relationship
between
the
mental
defect
of
those
of
the
defendant
and
the
crime
which
occurred.
his
intelligence
quotient
was
65.
we
had
psychiatric
testimony
to
the
effect
that
he
was
a
moron.
now,
we
proceeded
on
that
premise.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
contended
this
man
was
malingering
when
he
took
the
stand,
when
indulged
in
this
peculiar
behavior
that
it
was
bizarre
and
peculiar
symptoms
but
that
this
was
an
attempt
to
fool
the
jury.
however,
even
if
that
be
true,
it
was
our
position
that
this
jury
should
never
have
known
of
the
fact
that
this
man
didn't
take
the
stand
on
two
prior
trials,
nor
should
it
also
ever
be
suggested
to
them
that
he
might
have
been
involved
in
other
offenses.
and
the
record
will
reflect
that
he
hasn't
convicted
of
other
offenses
on
prior
occasions.
the
dissent
of
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
this
case
comes
within
the
ruling
of
either
raffel
or
grunewald.
they
could
--
judge
fay
said,
there
was
no
inconsistency
between
his
behavior
at
the
third
trial,
and
his
failure
to
take
the
stand.
judge
fay
further
said
that
this
man,
having
exercised
a
constitutional
right,
came
within
the
ruling
of
the
grunewald
case,
that
the
jury
should
never
have
known
of
that
particular
fact.
on
--
in
the
brief
filed
here
and
in
the
supreme
court,
the
government
takes
an
entirely
different
position
than
the
opinion
written
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
fact,
i
think
it's
further
suggested,
they
have
repudiated
the
ruling
of
the
five
judges
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
they
say
that
this
question
was
framed
only
for
the
purpose
of
memory
testing
to
see
if
this
man
can
remember,
had
he
gone
to
school,
was
he
married,
had
any
children,
and
other
of
that
sort.
they
didn't
put
him
on
the
basis
of
demeanor-evidence.
they
said
the
prosecutor
have
the
right
to
phrase
these
questions
for
the
purpose
of
testing
the
memory
of
the
defendant
when
he
took
the
stand
hoping
that
he
might
have
slipped
if
he
were
malingering
and
said
something
which
would
persuade
the
jury
that
this
man
was
not
telling
the
truth,
it
was
acting
or
faking
his
insanity.
however,
they
further,
in
their
brief,
say
this
that
even
if
it
was
wrong,
they
concede
the
question
shouldn't
have
been
asked
because
they
said
the
question
was
of
negligible
importance.
at
best,
it
had
margin
materiality
that
is
prohibitive,
the
value
was
not
sufficient,
because
of
the
danger
inherent
and
reminded
the
jury
that
this
man
had
exercised
his
constitutional
right.
however,
in
attempting
to
justify
that
position,
the
government
says
there
was
no
impact
upon
the
jury
because
when
the
question
was
asked,
we
approached
the
bench,
the
presiding
judge
said,
“what
was
it?”
he
didn't
hear
the
question
apparently.
they
didn't
try
to
analogize
between
these
situations,
the
fact
that
the
court
wasn't
aware
of
what
the
question
was,
the
sequitur
is
then
the
jury
didn't
hear
the
question.
well,
i
don't
have
to
labor
the
obvious
but
i
was
sitting
in
the
courtroom
as
was
the
prosecutor,
as
was
the
court
reporter.
the
jury
as
you
know
was
at
short
distance
from
the
participants
in
the
crime.
now,
i
was
further
removed
as
was
the
prosecutor
and
as
was
the
court
reporter
from
the
defendant
or
from
the
prosecutor
when
he
made
this
observation.
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
taken
the
stand,
willie,
isn't
it?"
another
suggests
that
because
the
court
didn't
hear
the
question,
it
then
followed
that
the
jury
didn't
hear
the
question,
is
neither
here
nor
there.
i
say
the
fact
that
we
hear
it.
it
must
be
assumed
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record,
which
would
demonstrate
that
the
jury
never
heard
that
particular
question.
so
not
having
heard
that
the
government
now
says,
"it
couldn't
have
been
prejudicial
to
this
defendant."
however,
they
alleged,
go
on
to
say
that
if
this
question
was
heard
by
the
jury,
its
prejudice
was
minimal
and
it
could
have
been
cured
by
an
instruction
from
the
court.
we
say
that
that
question
could
not
have
been
cured
by
an
instruction
from
the
court,
because
i
think
when
you
ask
a
witness
or
a
defendant,
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
taken
the
stand"
i
suggest
the
impact
upon
that
jury
is
tremendously
prejudicial.
it's
not
insignificant,
it's
not
minimal,
and
it's
not
maneuvered.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
where
is
it
in
here?
mr.
edward
l.
carey
i
say
it's
prejudiced
in
several
reasons.
well,
this
man
was
first
tried
in
1953.
the
durham
rule
was
not
the
rule
in
the
district
of
columbia.
that
opinion
came
down
in
1954.
this
man
could
not
come
within
the
rule
or
in
the
durham
rule,
and
a
mental
defective
could
not
raise
the
defense
of
insanity.
but
in
1954,
the
durham
rule
came
down.
in
the
trial
in
1955,
he
was
entitled
to
rely
on
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
durham
case
as
he
was
when
we
tried
in
1958.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
is
correct.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that's
right.
now,
this
jury
was
never
told
that
a
mental
defective
came
within
the
ruling
of
the
durham
rule
because
they
couldn't
have
been
in
1953.
then
that
jury
might
have
assumed
the
fact
that
he
is
now
claiming
he's
a
mental
defective.
he
also
claimed
he's
a
mental
defective
in
1953
when
he
had
no
right
to
raise
such
a
defense.
so
then
that
jury
might
have
assumed
that
this
man
had
that
same
consistent
defense
on
three
particular
trials
and
it
wasn't
true,
because
--
and
had
he
been
a
mental
defective,
he
would
have
exhibited
at
the
first
trial
which
he
couldn't
do.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
well,
i
--
i
thought
you
--
mr.
edward
l.
carey
now,
if
the
only
inconsistency
we
contend
occurred
in
this
particular
trial
was
the
inconsistency
in
taking
the
stand
at
the
third
trial
and
not
taking
the
stand
at
two
prior
occasions.
we
contend
that
is
not
the
type
of
inconsistency
which
was
intended
to
be
the
ruling
of
the
raffel
case.
in
the
raffel
case,
as
this
court
knows,
at
the
first
trial
that
the
prohibition
agent
testified
that
when
he
arrested
raffel
in
this
ginmill
or
whatever
it
was,
that
raffel
admitted
to
him
that
he
was
the
owner
of
that
particular
illicit
establishment.
at
the
second
trial,
raffel
took
the
stand
and
he
denied
that
he
ever
made
such
statement
to
the
prohibition
agent.
so
there
you
have
a
very
definite
inconsistency
in
evidence.
once
you
have
a
man
not
doing
anything
and
this
allegation
is
made,
when
he
takes
the
stand
at
the
second
trial
and
he
denies
that
this
is
not
so.
so
there
you
have
a
very
definite
inconsistency.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
reply
to
your
inquiry,
you
asked
about
what
the
prejudice
was
by
his
taking
the
stand
at
the
third
trial
and
not
at
the
first
and
second.
well,
the
--
the
prejudice
as
we
see
it
is
this.
in
--
in
the
third
trial,
we
depend
on
the
basis
that
this
man
was
a
mental
defective.
being
a
mental
defective,
he
came
within
the
ruling
of
the
durham
opinion.
now,
he
could
not
have
taken
the
stand
at
the
first
trial
and
demonstrated
that
he
was
a
mental
defective
because
it
was
at
the
rule
of
law
in
the
district
of
columbia
at
that
time.
so
we
say
it
is
prejudice
to
suggest
to
the
jury
that
this
man
was
consistently
a
mental
defective
and
having
the
right
to
take
the
stand
at
the
first
trial
in
1952
and
demonstrate
he
was
a
mental
defective
just
wasn't
correct
because
he
couldn't
demonstrate
as
a
mental
defectiveness
in
1953
because
it
wasn't
the
rule
there
at
the
district
of
columbia.
so,
we
suggest
and
so
suggesting
to
the
jury,
"this
is
the
first
time
you
have
taken
the
stand."
that
jury
doesn't
have
the
right
to
assume
if
they
believed
the
prosecutor
in
this
absolute
representation
which
he
made
that
this
man
didn't
take
the
stand
at
the
first
trial
when
he
could
have
and
he
didn't.
so,
we
say
that
presents
a
prejudicial
aspect
to
the
prosecutor's
comment.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
affirming
the
opinion
or
the
judge
in
the
lower
court
said
and
it's
on
page
2
of
our
reply
brief,
i
quote.
it
says,
"in
short,
for
that
purpose,
the
question
while
relevant
and
competent
was
of
only
of
marginal
materiality
and
opposing
of
it
could
be
justified
under
grunewald
only
if
did
not
in
fact
have
collateral
prejudicial
effects.
if
it
did
--
the
government,
"if
it
did,
we
concede
as
we
noted
the
outset,
the
question
should
not
have
been
asked."
however,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"as
we
see
it,
the
challenge
question
bears
on
the
appellant's
credibility
and
in
some
degree
whether
he's
guilty
of
the
acts
charged."
so,
you
now
have
an
entirely
different
position
taken
by
the
government.
they
don't
adopt
the
court
of
appeals'
majority
opinion.
they
now
concede
that
this
question,
asked
of
the
defendant
stewart,
was
of
marginal
materiality.
i'd
like
to
quote
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
the
grunewald
case
and
i
quote,
"we
are
not
mindful
of
the
question
whether
a
prior
statement
is
officially
inconsistent
to
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
question
of
credibility,
is
usually
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
but
where
such
evidentiary
matter
as
we
contend
this
particular
aspect
as
--
as
grave
constitutional
overtones
as
it
does
here,
we
feel
justified."
an
exercise
in
this
court
supervisory
control
to
pass
in
such
a
question,
this
is
particularly
so
because
in
this
case,
the
dangers
of
impermissible
use
and
the
government
almost
concede
it's
impermissible,
because
they
say
it
has
limited
value,
it's
a
marginal
materiality.
the
court
says,
"because
in
this
case,
the
dangers
of
impermissible
use
of
this
evidence
far
outweighs
whatever
advantage
the
government
implied
of
derived
from
it
if
properly
used."
we
find
ourselves
in
that
particular
situation.
i'd
like
to
say
too
--
further,
the
difficulties
as
i
see
this
particular
case
is
this
--
the
difficulties
are.
here's
a
man,
exercises
a
constitutional
right
to
stay
off
the
stand.
he
stays
off
the
stand
at
the
second
time.
the
third
time,
he
takes
the
stand
and
the
jury
is
reminded
of
that
particular
fact.
what
persuasive
effect
does
that
position
have
on
the
defendant?
does
he
take
the
stand
at
the
first
trial
or
does
he
not?
he
maybe
under
compulsion
to
take
the
stand
every
time,
this
type
--
despite
the
fact
as
a
constitutional
right
not
to
do
so,
because
if
he
doesn't
take
the
stand
at
the
first
trial,
the
danger
is
always
imminent.
that
if
he
does
take
the
stand
at
the
second
trial,
he'll
be
reminded
of
the
fact
and
so
well
the
jury
that
you
would
an
opportunity
in
a
prior
occasion
when
you
were
tried
for
this
particular
crime
and
you
did
nothing
about
it.
we
say
that
if
a
man
exercises
such
right,
he
should
never
be
placed
in
an
embarrassing
situation
where
the
prosecutor
has
the
right
to
remind
him
of
taking
that
constitutional
position.
so
gentlemen,
we
say
on
those
bases,
we
ask
that
this
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
this
occurred
on
the
second
day
of
a
five-day
trial,
second
or
third
day
of
a
five-day
trial.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
subsequent?
no,
sir,
your
honor.
the
prosecutor
made
no
reference
to
it
and
of
course,
we
made
no
reference
to
it
nor
did
the
court
make
any
reference
to
it.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
no,
there
was
none,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
and
the
reason
for
that
was
this.
it
was
our
considered
judgment.
the
representation
by
the
prosecutor
was
so
substantially
prejudicial
that
a
director
and
admonition
from
the
court
would
have
no
effect
on
the
jury.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
may
have
been
a
position.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
that
--
that
may
be
one
of
the
positions
but
that
isn't
the
position
we
took,
your
honor.
but
justice
--
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
asked
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
this
argument
to
the
jury.
i
have
a
short
excerpt
here
which
i'd
like
to
read.
this
is
what
the
mr.
--
the
prosecutor
said,
"now,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
we
haven't
had
--
mr.
edward
l.
carey
closing.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
transcript.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
it's
in
the
transcript.
it's
not
in
the
printed
record,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
now,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
we
have
had
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
willie
lee
stewart.
willie
lee
stewart
testified
and
direct
from
mr.
carey
and
uncrossed
for
me
and
his
testimony
might
be
summed
up
as
the
wholesome
of
nothing.
for
this
reason,
not
that
i
say
that
you
should
not
consider
when
you
consider
all
the
evidence,
you
must,
you
have
got
to."
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
defendant
said
nothing
with
regard
to
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged
but
that
shortly,
certainly
established
to
the
fight,
the
prosecutor
believed.
there
is
no
inconsistency
between
the
defendant
taking
the
stand
and
testifying
as
he
did
at
the
third
trial
and
his
failure
to
take
the
stand
at
the
first
and
second
trial.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
i
should
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
i
think
it's
the
most
extraordinary
position
for
the
government
of
united
states
to
take.
when
the
prosecutor
said
to
the
defendant,
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
taken
the
stand,
isn't
it
willie?"
and
willie
says,
"what?"
and
the
question
is
repeated,
the
representation
is
again
made.
now,
the
government's
brief,
they
say,
"this
is
for
the
purpose
of
memory
testing."
they
further
suggest
the
prosecutor
had
the
right
to
assume
a
false
premise
in
order
to
mislead
the
defendant
in
answering
a
question
which
might
destroy
his
defense
of
insanity.
i
think
that
conduct
has
been
condemned
by
this
court
in
the
berger
case.
i
think
no
assistant
--
united
states
attorney
has
the
right
to
frame
a
question
which
isn't
based
on
factual
and
accurate
evidence.
the
government
says,
namely
his
premise
was
false.
well,
i
say,
that
is
totally
incorrect,
that
should
never
be
done.now,
we
get
to
the
proposition.
they
suggest
that
his
--
his
behavior
at
the
third
trial
was
different
than
his
behavior
at
the
first
two
trials.
there's
no
extrinsic
evidence
before
this
court
to
so
support
that
proposition.
if
the
government
wanted
to
support
the
proposition
that
his
demeanor
at
the
third
trial
was
different
than
his
demeanor
at
the
first
and
second
trial,
there
are
ways
or
there
were
ways
to
have
done
that.
that
was
not
done.
they
could've
subpoenaed
or
they
could've
brought
in
united
states
marshals.
they
could've
brought
in
the
clerk.
they
could've
found
out
other
people
who
are
present
at
the
first
and
second
trial.
having
not
done
that,
i
do
say
now,
they
not
--
cannot
contend
that
his
behavior
at
the
third
trial
was
inconsistent
with
his
behavior
at
the
first
and
second
trial
because
his
behavior
was
not
in
evidence
at
the
first
and
second
trial.
our
position
gentlemen
is
that
the
risk
of
prejudice
as
indicated
in
the
grunewald
case
is
too
great
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
asked
this
particular
question.
the
government
concedes
it
has
--
of
negligence
--
negligible
importance
of
marginal
materiality.
but
haven't
taken
that
chance,
they
asked
this
man
about
the
exercise
of
a
constitutional
right.
we
say
that's
wrong.
the
government
continually
insists
that
the
jury
paid
no
attention
to
this
particular
factual
representation
by
the
prosecutor.
upon
what
do
they
premise
that?
they
say
because
the
court
didn't
hear
it.
what
in
fact
that
had
upon
the
jury?
this
government
cannot
speculate
because
--
and
we
went
to
the
bench
and
the
record
will
so
indicate.
i
made
a
motion
for
a
mistrial.
and
i
said,
i
would
like
--
i'm
reading
from
the
record,
page
140.
"i
don't
think
this
jury
should
be
reminded
of
the
fact,
this
is
the
first
time
he
has
taken
the
stand.
what
happened
in
the
other
trials
is
no
concern
of
theirs
at
all,
it
is
highly
prejudicial."
that
was
the
position
we
took
then,
that's
the
position
we
take
now.
the
court
then
judge
letts
said
when
i
made
that
representation,
"that
wasn't
mentioned,
was
it?"
mr.
carey,
"he
mentioned
it."
mr.
smithson,
"read
it.
i
would
like
to
have
you
read
it."
the
court,
"the
conviction?"
mr.
carey,
"no,
taking
the
stand.
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
taken
the
stand,
willie,
isn't
it?"
then
the
prosecutor
says
this
--
the
government
now
says
the
prosecutor
didn't
mean
what
he
said.
i
presume
the
prosecutor
is
familiar
with
the
fifth
amendment
which
allows
a
man
to
exercise
his
freedom
of
choice.
i
think
that's
fundamental
in
the
law.
it's
not
an
intricate
question.
it's
not
a
conflict
question.
i
would
suggest
that
every
assistant
united
states
attorney
is
familiar
with
the
fifth
amendment.
smithson
says,
"i
think
that
is
a
fact
that
the
jury
is
entitled
to
know."
in
so
many
occasions,
they
refer
to
the
record
of
the
first
case
or
the
second
case.
mr.
carey,
"i
think
it
is
highly
prejudicial,
i'd
like
to
have
it
read."
the
court,
"motion
denied."
now,
the
government
says,
when
mr.
smithson
says,
"that
is
a
fact."
what
is
he
talking
about?
the
basis
of
my
motion
for
a
mistrial,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
said,
"this
is
the
first
time
you
have
taken
the
stand,
isn't
it?"
the
prosecutor
follows
up
and
said,
"that
is
a
fact
which
this
jury
is
entitled
to
know."
we
can't
quibble
about
that.
there's
no
ambiguity
about
it.
it
reached
with
clarity
as
i
see
it
because
we
knew
what
he
meant
and
what
he
said.
my
final
--
the
grunewald
case
and
i
should
like
to
read
this
again.
the
court
says,
"i
can
think
of
no
special
circumstance."
the
concurrent
opinion,
"i
can
think
of
no
special
circumstances
that
would
justify
use
of
a
constitutional
privilege
to
discredit
or
convict
a
person
who
asserts
it.
the
value
of
constitutional
privilege
is
largely
destroyed
and
persons
can
be
penalized
for
relying
on
them.
it
seems
peculiarly
incongruous
and
indefensible
for
courts
which
exist
in
that
colloquy
of
the
constitution
to
draw
inferences
of
lack
of
honesty
from
invocation
of
our
privilege
deemed
worthy
of
enshrinement
in
the
constitution.
we
contend
now
as
we
did
on
october,
1958
that
i've
consistently
contended.
this
representation
of
a
fact,
more
a
representation
on
the
question
was
highly
prejudicial
and
we
contend
this
man
was
denied
a
fair
trial.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
l.
carey
we
did
appreciate
your
remarks,
your
honor.
