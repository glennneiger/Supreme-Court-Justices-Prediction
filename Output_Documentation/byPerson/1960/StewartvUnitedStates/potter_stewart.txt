what
was
the
--
what
was
the
defense
here?
what
was
the
theory
of
the
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
always
possible,
at
least
you
know
we
theoretically
hold
that
the
jury
simply
isn't
going
to
leave
anything
the
prosecution
witness
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
want
to
be
just
sure
mr.
carey
that
i
understand
your
point
as
to
where
the
prejudice
in
here
is
in
the
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
where
--
where
is
it?
how
--
how
was
--
how
was
the
defendant
in
this
case
with
this
kind
of
a
defense
prejudiced
by
asking
of
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
1955
was
the
second
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
1958
is
this
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
still,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
--
probably
i
am
being
too
smutty,
maybe
during
lunch
time,
you
can
think
of
a
way
to
straighten
me
on.
so
i
won't
waste
any
more
of
your
time
then.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
true
isn't
it
that
the
only
real
issue
in
all
three
trials
was
--
whether
not
this
man
was
mentally
competent
or
insane?
justice
potter
stewart
first
trial,
i
understand
was
--
had
before
the
durham
case
came
down
and
the
second
two
trials
after
it.
so
the
test
of
insanity
changed
in
the
interim.
but
the
only
issue
in
all
three
trials
was
the
insanity
of
this
defendant.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
am
i
correct
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
belcher,
throughout
your
brief
and
somewhat
now
today
in
your
arguments,
you've
--
you've
insisted
that
this
error,
if
it
was
error,
this
possible
error,
certainly
was
not
such
as
to
warrant
the
granting
of
the
motion
for
the
mistrial
which
is
the
only
motion
made
and
which
was
denied.
but
in
the
district
of
columbia
practice,
when
a
motion
is
made
for
a
mistrial
and
that's
denied,
then
it's
--
is
it
up
to
the
defendant's
lawyer
to
say,
"well,
your
honor,
if
you
don't
grant
a
mistrial,
will
you
please
direct
the
jury
to
disregard
the
last
question
answered?"
doesn't
the
judge
on
his
motion,
if
he
says,
"no,
i
won't
grant
a
mistrial
but
--
but
i
will
tell
the
jury
not
to
--
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
last
question
answered,"
isn't
that
the
usual
practice?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
up
to
the
defendant's
counsel
to
ask
each
step
of
the
way,
"well,
if
you
won't
do
this
do
that.
if
you
won't
do
that,
do
that."
justice
potter
stewart
here,
did
the
district
judge
indicate
the
question
was
not
error
at
all?
he
just
--
he
simply
overruled
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
he
didn't
indicate
it
was
a
correct
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
proper
question.
justice
potter
stewart
they
didn't
volunteer.
