justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
reply?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
didn't
cross-examine
or
contest
the
testimony
of
the
mother
who
was
a
confirming
witness
for
the
daughter,
did
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
--
but
wasn't
there
--
but
she
was
a
witness
in
the
earlier
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
her
deposition
was
taken,
i
mean,
the
â€“
her
testimony
was
introduced,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
the
third
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
was
she
--
was
the
testimony
which
was
allowed
to
be
introduced
before
they
introduced
a
challenge
of
a
testimony
on
the
fact
that
confirming
a
daughter's
eye-witness
testimony?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
asking
the
question
that
justice
stewart
asked
and
justice
whittaker
asked.
was
the
--
were
there
really
any
contest
over
the
commission
of
a
homicide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
case
overturned
on
the
defense
of
insanity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
cross-examined
some
policemen
too,
didn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
to
show
up
that
they
are
not
as
accurate
as
they
think
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
they're
not
relevant,
not
on
essential
matters,
really.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
what
the
police
had
described.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
make
an
opening
to
the
jury?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
in
that,
opening
what
did
you
say,
you
can
plan
--
what
defense
did
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
you
(inaudible)
insanity.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
only
a
very
small
fraction
of
the
five-day
trial,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
a
small
but
a
fraction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when,
in
closing
or
opening,
closing
or
opening?
justice
felix
frankfurter
closing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
just
reflecting
on
the
reliability
of
--
of
any
of
us,
that
counsel
can't
agree
on
what
they
took
place
about
how
many
days
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
an
amusing
fact
that.
it
has
to
be
between
two
and
five
and
three
and
six.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
isn't
important
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
do
think
there
is
some
importance
as
to
question
elicited
by
justice
harlan.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
to
the
setting,
the
context
of
this
episode
is
--
is
important,
i
believe
very
important.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
day
of
the
length
of
a
trial
does
become
relevant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
maybe
they
have
a
problem
with
prejudice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
that
court
of
appeals
didn't
consciously
at
least
or
as
revealed
by
what
they
wrote
weren't
confronted
with
the
problem
of
prejudice.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
question
is
permissible,
then
you
don't
bother
about
prejudice
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there
are
none.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
answer
in
your
--
the
--
the
first
--
your
first
statement
in
reply
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
is
probably
you
go
on
guessing,
it's
probably
the
correct
answer
insofar
as
the
conscience,
he
had
a
purpose.
even
the
assistant
district
attorney
has
gone
over
their
purposes,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
mean
the
second
sentence
indicates
they
were
talking
about
the
trial
so
i
thought
i'd
ask
him
about
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
experts
did
the
government
have
at
this
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
four.
how
many
in
the
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
knowledge
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
forgive
me.
in
the
testimony
of
these
five
experts,
four
on
one
side
and
one
on
the
other,
was
his
conduct
affirmative
or
negative?
at
the
prior
two
trials,
that's
all
accredited
too,
to
their
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
of
course
there's
lots
in
there
about
the
prior
trials
in
--
introduced
by
the
defendant
himself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
what
i
want
to
know,
was
there
any
relevance
by
the
experts
all
for
the
government
and
one
for
the
defendant.
was
there
any
reference
to
his
conduct
--
to
his
conduct
at
those
two
prior
trials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
he
did
off
a
stand
on
which
he
--
if
he
never
was
on
or
what
he
did
as
he
sat
there,
any
reference
at
all?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
subject
matter
of
this
--
of
this
question
that
was
--
that's
in
controversy
here,
remotely
adverted
before
the
district
attorney
put
this
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
won't
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
either
before
or
after.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
beyond
that,
was
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
any
--
were
any
questions
put
to
the
four
experts
regarding
the
way
in
which
he
met
the
prior
trials?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
any
reference
as
to
this
witnesses
the
--
some
of
the
witnesses,
some
during
that
period
didn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
did
they
say
anything
as
to
what
he
said
or
didn't
say
regarding
his
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
was
there
any
reference
in
the
testimony
of
the
experts
regarding
his
attitude
toward
the
accusation
for
which
he
was
on
trial
twice
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
apart
from
the
inferences
that
the
argument
that
can
be
derived
and
are
properly
derived
from
the
putting
of
the
question?
would
you
say
--
i
know
this
is
a
conclusion
i'm
drawing
but
what
you
say
in
the
context
of
trying
to
find
out
what
kind
of
a
person
he
was.
when
he
was
put
on
the
stand
at
the
third
trial,
that
this
was
an
isolated
discrete
in
episode
unrelated
to
anything
else
that
he
was
asked,
that
was
put
in
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
that
they
had
to
reach
that
conclusion,
that
he's
a
link
--
malinger,
that
he
was
an
actor
in
short.
can
you
say
more
than
they
--
in
fact,
they
did
reach
that
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
evidence,
the
substantiality
of
which
is
not
challenged.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
they
had
to,
you
at
least
draw
a
little
bit
on
my
credulity
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
my
confidence
in
--
in
--
the
goaling
out
a
death
sentence
to
concededly
a
person
as
eloquent
that
this
person
was.
no
doubt
about
that,
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
have
been
--
you
--
you've
been
the
district
attorney's
office,
considerable
time,
haven't
you
mr.
belcher?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
--
just
about
covers
the
period
of
this
--
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
there
been
any
case
that
has
had
this
kind
of
a
history?
eight
years
--
this
is
something
like
eight
years
since
this
crime
or
since
this
homicide
took
place.
three
trials
and
now
we're
here
to
decide
whether
there
should
be
a
fourth
trial.
anything
comparable
to
that
(inaudible)
of
the
district
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
--
mr.
belcher,
if
a
district
attorney
asked
an
obviously
improper
question,
suppose
the
district
attorney
hadn't
--
had
asked
here,
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
gone
on
the
stand,
isn't
it
willie?
"what?"
"this
is
the
first
time
you've
gone
on
the
stand,
isn't
it
willie?"
in
any
--
but
isn't
it
a
fact
that
you
didn't
go
on
the
stand
and
that
now
you
are
trying
to
fool
this
jury?
suppose
the
district
attorney
would
so
latently
incompetent
in
words
as
to
ask
such
a
question.
you
wouldn't
say
defendant's
counsel
had
to
say,
"i
move
your
order
to
strike
that
from
the
record."
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
do
you
say
--
why
do
you
say
this
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
incumbent
upon
to
do
something.
justice
felix
frankfurter
then,
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
do
you
say
yes
because
if
one
thought
--
if
one
thought,
he
put
this
question
in
order
to
get
that
fact
before
the
jury,
one
would
have
one
reason?
if
one
says
--
if
--
if
one
thinks
that
that
would
be
the
--
that
was
--
that
isn't
the
implication
of
that
question,
you
take
another
view.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
i
thought
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
that
that
was
clear,
that
that's
--
he
did
--
in
order
to
get
that
fact
before
the
jury
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
might
go
on
one
inference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
you
have
to
have
addressed
in
three
times,
the
judge
quite
stated
and
then
--
whereupon,
would
you
read
that
--
where
upon
the
indicated
question
was
read
by
the
reporter,
motion
denied
both
for
the
record
of
discussion
or
for
the
record.
mr.
belcher,
on
page
141,
the
court
--
the
jury
will
please
keep
in
mind
the
admonition,
you
will
be
--
is
that
just
the
admonition
they
shouldn't
talk
with
anybody?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
every
time,
they
left
them
out
for
10
minutes,
he
resists
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
belcher
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
can't
decide
this
case
on
just
this
question
and
that
answer.
indeed,
i
don't
think
you
can
decide
this
case
except
on
the
basis
of
a
1500
pages
of
stenographic
minutes
of
the
trial.
