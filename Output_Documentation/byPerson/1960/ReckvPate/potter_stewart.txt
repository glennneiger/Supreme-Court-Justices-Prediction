justice
potter
stewart
i
am
interested
in
this
handball
court.
is
a
handball
court
a
normal
accoutrement
of
a
police
station
in
chicago?
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
for
mr.
reck.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
--
as
a
--
an
enclosed
windowless
room
like
a
squash
court
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
--
that
interesting
fact
about
the
illinois
appellate
procedure
doesn't
have
very
much
to
do
with
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
that's
if
this
confession
was
properly
admissible
it's
why
surely,
this
confession
was
of
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
conviction.
it's
a
detailed
confession
of
the
--
to
the
crime
of
which
he
was
charged,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
anything
to
do
about
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
though
to
support
the
indictment,
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
voluntary.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
separate
question
and
the
different
question
--
the
--
different
from
--
from
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wines
while
we're
on
illinois
practice,
i
should
know,
but
i
don't
--
what
the
--
what
the
practice
is
in
the
trial
court
when
the
claim
is
made
that
a
confession
was
--
is
inadmissible?
now
is
this
something
that's
decided
preliminarily
by
the
judge
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
at
that
point
at
that
hearing
before
the
judge,
can
the
defendant
testify
without
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
he
testify
without
waiving
any
future
privilege
against
this
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
did
the
defendant
testify
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
at
that
stage?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
the
jury
instructed
to
do
in
the
event
that
they
find
that
the
confession
was
involuntary?
justice
potter
stewart
how?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
all
--
we're
all
for
these
kinds
of
teenagers,
this
(inaudible)
was
1953.
justice
potter
stewart
all
about
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
was
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
post-conviction
proceeding.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
an
appeal
(inaudible)
though,
was
it
not?
