mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
have
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
or
the
seventh
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
quashing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
remanding
the
petitioner
here
to
the
custody
of
warden
of
the
illinois
state
penitentiary
at
joliet,
illinois,
where
petitioner
was
then
and
is
now
confined.
petitioner
is
confined
in
the
state
penitentiary,
pursuant
to
a
judgment
of
conviction
of
the
crime
of
murder,
which
was
imposed
upon
him
after
a
trial
before
a
judge
and
jury
in
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
in
1936.
at
his
trial,
petitioner
contested
the
admissibility
of
two
confessions
which
were
introduced
into
evidence
against
him.
timely
motion
was
made
to
suppress
these
confessions
invoking
with
federal
constitution.
it
was
overruled.
the
confessions
were
received
in
evidence.
petitioner
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
199
years
in
the
penitentiary.
petitioner
was
unable
to
appeal
his
conviction
because
he
had
no
money
to
purchase
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
at
his
murder
trial.
thereafter,
when
the
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act
was
adopted
following
this
court's
decision
in
marino
against
ragen,
petitioner
filed
a
petition
for
a
post-conviction
hearing
under
that
act,
received
a
hearing,
additional
testimony
was
taken,
some
transcripts
where
then
written
up
at
state
expense.
after
hearing
the
post-conviction
judge
denied
relief.
i
might
add
that
in
the
post-conviction
hearing
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
explicitly
invoked
as
a
ground
for
the
petitioner's
prayer
that
his
conviction
be
set
aside,
because
coerced
confession
were
used
against
him.
on
writ
of
error
proceedings
in
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
full
hearing
was
--
had
briefs
and
arguments.
all
of
the
federal
constitutional
claims,
which
are
now
here,
were
raised
there.
relief
was
denied
on
the
merits
of
the
federal
constitutional
question.
there
was
then
a
petition
for
certiorari
timely
filed
in
this
court.
the
petition
was
denied
and
the
order
of
denial
read
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
denied
without
prejudice
to
the
right
of
petitioner
to
apply
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
an
appropriate
u.s.
district
court.
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
followed.
the
district
judge
received
into
evidence
all
of
the
transcripts
of
the
state
court
proceedings
in
the
post-conviction
hearing
case
and
in
the
original
murder
trial.
both
sides
rested.
the
district
judge
ultimately
decided
that
by
the
present
day
standards
announced
by
this
court
in
such
cases
as
watts
against
indiana,
haley
against
ohio,
chambers
against
florida,
petitioner's
confessions
were
obtained
in
a
manner
which
violated
due
process,
but
since
none
of
those
cases
were
on
the
books
in
1936,
the
rules
of
those
cases
were
not
applicable
to
petitioner's
case
and
petitioner
was
remanded
to
the
custody
of
the
warden.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
ignored
the
district
court's
theory.
it
held
that
by
any
standards,
the
confessions
were
voluntary
and
affirmed.
this
court
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
june
27th
of
1960,
gave
us
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
we
have
no
printed
record,
but
our
proceeding
upon
the
original
papers
pursuant
to
the
instructions
of
the
clerk
of
this
court.
the
facts
--
mr.
donald
page

no,
your
honor.
that
is
the
only
basis
in
the
record.
the
court
of
appeals
acted
on
the
same
record,
that
the
district
judge
did.
mr.

yes,

mr.

100%
of
the

and

trial,
all
the

has
been
assembled
by
slow
and
painful
stages.
mr.
donald

of
the
trial.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
we
are
not.
it's
stipulated
by
both
of
the
parties
in
writing
in
the
record
at
page,
i
believe,
it's
page
67
of
the
blue
bound
transcript
and
record,
which
is
before
your

in
writing
that
these
are
the
true,

and
authentic
records
of
all
of
the
proceedings
in
the
courts
of
illinois.
mr.
donald
page

your
honor,
there
--
there
was
no
oral
testimony
before
the
district
court.
mr.
donald
page
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
not
quite,
your
honor.
there
is
one
qualification
here.
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
of
the
petitioner,
the
post
conviction-judge
said
that
he
was
going
--
first
he
ordered
the
transcript
of
petitioner's
entire
murder
trial
written
up
at
state
expense.
the
states
attorney
of
cook
county
came
in
and
this
is
in
the
record
and
said,
“we're
not
going
to
do
it.”
and
the
post-conviction
judge,
judge
genalli
then
said,
“well,
you
only
have
to
write
up
part
of
it.”
and
after
many
weeks
had
passed
in
which
he
kept
reiterating
his
order,
the
state's
attorney
of
cook
county
did
provide
us
with
the
pretrial,
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
prior
to
the
admission
of
petitioner's
confession
in
evidence
at
his
murder
trial,
but
refused
to
give
us
the
proceedings
that
were
had
after
the
trial
judge
admitted
the
confessions
at
the
murder
trial.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
got
that
transcript,
but
the
post-conviction
judge
refused
to
give
us
the
transcript
of
what
happened
after
the
confessions
came
into
evidence.
we
assigned
this
as
error
before
the
post-conviction
judge,
invoking
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that
is
a
refusal
to
give
us
a
transcript
and
this
theory
of
ours
was
rejected.
we
assigned
it
again
as
error
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
again
it
was
rejected.
they
did
not
even
advert
to
this
contention
in
their
opinion.
we
assigned
it
again
as
error
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
which
we
filed
here
and
of
course
that
was
that.
later
on,
after
the
griffin
against
illinois
was
decided,
the
illinois
supreme
court
adopted
a
rule,
giving
everybody
a
free
transcript,
if
he
was
indigent
and
imprisoned
and
acting
under
that
rule,
we
finally
got
the
1500
some
odd
pages
of
testimony
that
had
gone
in
at
the
murder
trial,
subsequent
to
the
time
that
the
confessions
were
received
in
evidence.
so
that
--
and
it
was
these
1500
pages
plus
the
record
that
had
gone
up
through
the
courts
of
illinois
originally
which
went
into
evidence
before
the
federal
district
judge,
so
that
we
now
have
every
word.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
and
the
testimony
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
also.
mr.
donald
page
moore
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
some
of
the
police
officers
changed
their
story
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
the
circumstances
under
which
petitioner's
confession
was
secured
are
uncontroverted,
except
in
certain
details
upon
which
we
do
not
rely
in
urging
that
his
confession
was
the
product
of
psychological
coercion
forbidden
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
petitioner
was
19
years
old
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
some
three
months
after
the
murder
of
the
chicago
physician,
dr.
peacock.
petitioner
had
a
history
of
institutionalization
in
institutions
for
the
mentally-defective.
he
had
been
repeatedly
examined
throughout
his
life
by
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
who
had
tested
his
intelligence
and
scored
it
as
anywhere
from
the
low
of
49
iq
to
a
high
of
approximately
70.
he
was
16
years
old
when
he
dropped
out
of
school.
he
was
still
in
the
7th
grade.
petitioner
was
known
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
adjective
whether
this
makes
him
a
moron
or
an
imbecile
or
what
a
psychologist
would
say.
if
the
average
intelligence
is
100,
i
guess
it
makes
him
half
as
intelligent
as
an
average
person
at
his
age.
the
only
psychiatrist
who
testified
at
the
trial
and
for
whose
qualifications
both
sides
vouched
was
the
director
of
the
behaviour
clinic
of
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
testified
that
the
19
year
old
defendant
had
the
intelligence
of
a
child
of
10
to
11
years
of
age.
that
testimony
is
uncontroverted.
none
of
these
facts
are
controverted.
i
take
it
the
respondent
concedes
this.
this
19
year
old
feeble-minded
boy
with
the
intelligence
of
a
10
year
old
child
was
arrested
on
a
wednesday
morning
at
11
a.m.
by
police
officers.
he
was
taken
into
a
chicago
police
station,
the
north
avenue
police
station,
held
in
a
second
floor
room
for
five
to
six
minutes
by
two
police
officers.
taken
downstairs,
put
in
a
police
van,
taken
to
a
second
police
station,
held
isolated
in
the
cell
there
for
approximately
two
hours,
returned
then
by
police
van
at
approximately
1:15
p.m.
to
the
north
avenue
police
station,
where
his
interrogation
commenced.
the
first
afternoon
he
was
interrogated
by
two
officers
for
a
period
of
approximately
five
and
one
half
hours.
he
was
fed
one
sandwich,
one
bottle
of
milk,
nothing
else,
returned
that
evening
to
still
another
station
of
the
chicago
police
department,
spent
the
night
there.
the
following
morning,
thursday
morning
at
10
a.m.,
he
was
brought
back
to
the
north
police
--
the
north
avenue
police
station
and
he's
second
day
of
interrogation
commenced.
this
interrogation
was
largely
conducted
and
i
emphasize
that
these
facts
are
established
almost
entirely
by
the
testimony
of
persecution
witnesses.
in
each
and
every
of
the
300
and
some
odd
footnotes
to
our
brief
where
we
cite
to
the
original
transcript
of
record,
we
have
identified
who
testified
to
the
facts
that
are
stated
in
the
text
and
on
whose
behalf
and
the
court
will
know
that
time
after
time
after
time,
it's
the
state's
witnesses
who
are
testifying
to
these
facts.
officer
riley
led
the
interrogation,
although
three
or
four
other
police
officers
participated
in
the
second
day
of
interrogation.
officer
riley
testified
without
contradiction
on
behalf
of
the
state
that
he
had
a
list
of
every
crime
that
had
been
committed
in
the
north
avenue
police
district
in
his
hand
and
it
was
this
list
that
he
was
referring
to
as
he
would
question
the
petitioner.
officer
riley
then
volunteered
from
the
stand
that
there
was
no
purpose
in
this
questioning.
after
this
purposeless
questioning
from
the
list
of
every
crime
in
the
district
had
gone
on
for
some
six
or
seven
hours
according
to
the
police
testimony,
reck
was
taken
to
still
another
police
station,
the
shakespeare
police
station,
held
there
briefly,
then
taken
downtown
to
the
central
police
headquarters
where
the
detective
bureau
is
and
placed
in
a
lineup.
reck's
testimony
is
that
thursday
night,
he
was
so
sick
that
he
could
remember
nothing
that
took
place.
all
we
know
about
what
happened
direct
thursday
night
is
what
i
have
just
told
you.
the
state
made
no
effort
to
explain
what
was
being
done
with
reck,
thursday
night.
the
only
scrap
of
testimony
we
have
is
that
he
went
down
for
the
show
up
and
that
he
was
not
returned
to
the
police
station
where
he
had
been
held
that
night.
captain
o'connell
testified
to
that,
that's
it.
the
record
is
a
blank
until
approximately
1
p.m.
on
the
third
day
of
petitioner's
interrogation
when
the
questioning
resumed.
this
is
friday,
march
27th,
1936
in
the
north
avenue
police
station.
several
officers
participated
in
the
questioning
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon.
an
assistant
state's
attorney
came
down
to
help
out.
we
have
located
at
least
five
individuals
by
name
and
time
who
were
participating
in
the
interrogation
on
friday
afternoon.
by
friday
evening
at
approximately
7
p.m.,
a
very
large
number
of
civilians
had
assembled
in
the
north
avenue
police
station.
one
officer
called
them
a
big
crowd.
officer
sergeant
aitken
described
them
as
100
or
more
individuals.
mr.
donald
page
moore
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
he
had
not,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
they
began
interrogating
reck
and
the
other
boys
i
believe,
at
approximately
the
same
time,
although
the
boys
were
separated
within
the
police
station
and
in
different
rooms.
this
is
my
inference.
the
record
is
not
explicit
on
that
particular
point.
at
least
100
civilians
were
in
the
north
avenue
police
station
at
around
7
p.m.
reck
was
being
exhibited
up
on
the
second
floor
to
these
civilians.
at
some
point
after
7
p.m.
reck
fainted
and
was
carried
to
a
bench
and
then
people
put
him
on
a
stretcher,
took
him
downstairs
to
the
street,
loaded
him
into
a
police
van
and
away
they
went
to
the
county
hospital
where
a
--
an
intern
gave
him
an
examination.
they
could
not
find
no
marks
or
bruises
on
his
body,
concluded
that
he
was
not
fit
for
the
hospital,
to
use
the
intern's
words,
and
rejected
him
to
use
another
word
of
the
intern
whereupon,
reck
was
loaded
back
into
the
wagon,
back
to
north
avenue,
placed
back
in
the
show
up.
he
became
ill,
police
officer,
officer
riley,
stated
on
the
trial
that
he
became
concerned
about
reck
and
that
he
wanted
reck
to
rest.
and
so
he
said,
“i
took
him
into
an
unfurnished
handball
court
in
the
rear
of
the
police
station,
second
floor
and
i
put
him
in
there
and
i
closed
the
door
and
i
kept
all
of
these
civilians
away
from
him
because
i
wanted
him
to
rest.”
unfortunately,
a
sergeant
aitken
in
charge
of
the
peacock
murder
investigation
and
two
other
police
officers
got
around
sergeant
riley
somehow
and
entered
the
handball
court
within
a
matter
of
one
or
two
or
three
or
four
minutes
after
reck
was
placed
in
there
to
rest
and
sergeant
aitken
and
the
officers
began
questioning
reck
specifically
about
the
peacock
murder.
now,
this
was
at
somewhere
between
8
o'clock
and
9
p.m.
on
the
third
night
of
his
interrogation.
this
was
the
first
interrogation
about
the
peacock
case.
shortly
thereafter,
a
police
officer
went
to
the
door
of
the
handball
court
and
called
to
a
dr.
abraham
who
was
standing
by
and
said
--
must've
said
something
like,
“you'd
better
come
in
here.
we
--
we
have
a
problem.”
dr.
abraham
walked
into
the
handball
court
where
reck
had
been
resting
with
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
if
--
not
in
frequently
such
facilities
are
found,
although
they
are
not
always
used
for
handball.
they're
used
for
general
gymnasium
purposes.
sir?
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
i
think
that
might
get
into
the
area
of
controverted
facts,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
it
was
not
being
used
so
far
as
we
know
for
that
purpose.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
no
furniture
entered
except
for
a
bench
that
they
brought
in
at
one
point
to
let
reck
rest
on
it.
that
was
--
but
that
was
later.
we're
still
on
the
point
where
reck
is
in
his
third
illness
of
the
evening
when
dr.
abraham
comes
into
the
handball
court.
he
sees
reck
standing.
reck's
shirt
is
unbuttoned.
its
tail
is
outside
of
his
pants.
his
pants,
the
fly
to
his
pants
is
unbuttoned.
reck's
hand
is
rubbing
his
abdomen.
reck's
face
is
ashen
according
to
dr.
abraham
who
testified
for
the
state,
when
he
testified
to
these
facts.
reck
appeared
very
nervous.
reck
was
permitted
to
sit
down.
when
he
sat
down
according
to
dr.
abraham,
he
got
his
color
back
in
his
face,
but
then
other
individuals
came
in
to
interrogate
reck.
he
was
told
to
stand
up
and
in
dr.
abraham's
phrase,
“the
color
went
away
from
him
again.”
dr.
abraham
was
then
for
some
reason
or
other,
had
to
leave
the
handball
court.
the
door
closed
and
the
interrogation
resumed.
some
time
thereafter,
dr.
abraham
was
again
called
to
the
handball
court
just
prior
to
the
time
that
dr.
abraham
had
been
called
to
the
handball
court,
according
to
uncontradicted
police
testimony,
reck
began
to
look
ill.
he
bent
over.
he
vomited
from
his
mouth.
he
vomited
a
quantity
of
blood.
it
seemed
to
come
out
of
his
mouth
all
in
a
rush.
he
bled
for
two
or
three
minutes.
when
dr.
abraham
entered
the
handball
court,
he
saw
reck
lying
on
the
floor.
he
saw
a
pool
of
blood
on
the
floor
beside
reck.
the
pool
of
blood
was
approximately
one
foot
in
diameter.
its
color
was
a
bright
red,
to
use
dr.
abraham's
phrase.
reck
was
placed
in
a
stretcher,
carried
out
of
the
station,
back
to
the
county
hospital.
morphine
and
two
other
drugs
were
administered
to
him
there.
he
was
kept
in
a
guarded
hospital
room
all
that
night.
i
might
add
that
in
the
preceding
three
days,
his
father
had
come
to
the
police
station
twice
and
that
night
he
came
to
the
hospital
and
police
guards
turned
him
away
from
his
son
and
would
not
permit
him
to
see
his
son.
the
next
morning
at
9:30,
reck
informed
the
doctors
and
it's
uncontroverted
that
he
did
in
fact
inform
the
doctors
that
the
police
had
been
beating
him
in
the
stomach
for
a
period
of
two
and
half
days
or
so
prior
to
this.
this
was
some
eight
or
nine
hours
before
he
confessed
to
the
peacock
murder.
he
had
seen
no
lawyer.
he
had
had
no
contact
with
his
family.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
he'd
heard
of
this
court's
decision
in
brown
against
mississippi
and
knew
the
legal
significance
of
such
a
beating
so
far
as
getting
suppressed
or
confession
that
he
haven't
made
yet.
nevertheless,
it
is
uncontradicted
that
he
told
the
officers
he
was
being
beaten.
it
is
of
course
contradicted,
his
testimony
that
he
was
in
fact
beaten
as
contradicted
by
the
officers.
9:30,
saturday
morning,
the
fourth
day
of
his
interrogation
commenced
when
he
was
placed
the
car
of
captain
harry
o'connell
of
the
chicago
police
department,
commander
of
the
north
avenue
station.
captain
o'connell
testified.
he
was
taken
out
of
the
hospital
in
a
wheelchair,
placed
in
o'connell's
car.
o'connell
got
in
the
car,
started
back
to
the
police
station
and
while
they
were
in
the
car,
the
interrogation
resumed.
back
to
the
handball
court
for
some
four
or
five
or
six
hours
according
to
captain
o'connell
down
to
the
state's
attorney's
office
at
about
2
to
3
o'clock
p.m.,
several
more
hours
of
interrogation,
reck
ultimately
confessed.
he
confessed
in
a
joint
confession
in
which
some
65
times
he
said,
“yes.”
or
“yes,
sir.”
and
on
a
few
occasion
volunteered
a
little
information,
reck's
answers
are
set
out
in
our
brief.
the
following
day,
he
made
another
confession
if
--
was
a
reiteration
of
the
joint
confession.
he
was
not
brought
to
court
and
arraigned
until
the
following
thursday,
which
was
the
ninth
day
of
detention,
thus
in
brief,
are
the
facts
which
led
to
the
confessions
which
we
claimed
are
coerced.
mr.
donald
page
moore
the
confessions
were
taken
down
in
each
instance
by
a
shorthand
reporter
of
the
state's
attorney's
office.
that
shorthand
reporter
testified
as
to
the
first
confession
that
reck
made,
but
when
reck
was
brought
into
the
room,
“i
could
his
face.
his
face
was
ashen.
he
looked
sick
not
well,
just
sick
looking.”
he,
“walked
weakly.”
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
state's
witness
who
was
employed
by
the
state's
attorney's
office
to
take
reck's
confession,
mr.
issacson.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
sergeant
andrew
aitken
who
was
in
charge
of
the
--
the
handball
court
incidence,
testified
that
a
dr.
abraham
had
told
him
aitken,
that
reck
“merely
suffered
a
nerve
reaction.”
dr.
abraham
although
he
testified
twice
at
the
trial
never
testified
that
reck
suffered
merely
a
nerve
reaction
and
sergeant
aitken
never
did
explain
how
the
nerve
reaction
caused
the
vomiting
of
the
blood.
i
might
only
add
that
sergeant
aitken,
who
vividly
described
the
vomiting
of
blood
at
the
post-conviction
hearing
in
1952,
absolutely
denied
that
he
ever
saw
reck
vomit
blood
at
the
murder
trial
in
1936
and
therefore,
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
suggest
that
sergeant
aitken's
credibility
is
somewhat
questionable
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
reck's
testimony
is
corroborated
by
three
other
witnesses.
four
men
were
convicted
of
the
peacock
murder.
two
of
them
are
on
guilty
pleas.
their
names
were
nash
and
goeth.
nash
and
goeth,
after
they
have
pleaded
guilty
and
been
sentenced
and
sent
down
to
the
penitentiary,
were
brought
back
to
testify
at
the
murder
trial.
they
had
already
been
sentenced
and
convicted.
nash
and
goeth
swore
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury
on
a
preliminary
hearing
to
test
the
admissibility
of
the
confessions
that
they
saw
reck
taken
into
this
handball
court,
that
the
door
close,
that
they
heard
screams
and
they
heard
reck
crying
and
shouting
out,
“don't,
don't,
don't.
please
don't
do
it
anymore.”
that
they
then
--
the
door
opened.
they
saw
reck
faint
and
saw
him
carried
out
of
there.
michael
livingston,
who
was
a
codefendant
with
reck
and
of
course
had
the
interest
of
the
defendant
in
testifying
because
he
was
indicted
for
the
murder
too
and
had
not
yet
been
sentenced,
also
corroborated
reck's
testimony.
this
was
denied
by
all
of
the
police
officers.
mr.
donald
page
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
documentation
on
the
question
of
what
was
and
what
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
found
in
the
prior
petition
for
certiorari
papers,
which
are
on
file
with
this
court
that
is
number
579
misc.
october
term,
1955.
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
that
case
completely
delineates
what
it
was
that
was
missing
before
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
consequently
before
this
court
on
the
prior
certiorari
proceeding.
mr.
donald
page
moore
the
date
of
this
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
1955
your
honor,
it's
in
7
illinois
--
7
illinois
2nd.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct
your
honor.
there
was
never
a
direct
review
on
a
full
transcript
of
the
murder
trial
itself.
mr.
donald
page
moore
there
was
an
appeal
based
on
what
illinois
lawyers
call
a
common-law
record
which
is
simply
the
written
papers
that
repost
in
the
court
file
of
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county
but
that
did
not
include
any
of
the
testimony.
therefore,
the
coerce
confession
issue
could
not
be
raised
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
page
moore
1952
your
honor
before
judge
(inaudible).
mr.
donald
page
moore
pardon?
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
was
pre-briefing
your
honor
but
post
marino.
mr.
donald
page
moore
poverty,
your
honor
is
all
that
shows
in
the
record.
in
fact
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
your
--
your
honor,
in
fact
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
this
man
had
an
iq
your
honor
of
something
under
70,
no
lawyer
and
no
money.
mr.
donald
page
moore
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record,
it's
a
very
interesting
story
but
i
think
--
i'm
afraid
i'd
be
wasting
this
court's
time.
mr.
donald
page
moore
at
the
murder
trial?
he
had
able
counsel
your
honor,
very
able
counsel.
mr.
donald
page
moore
no
counsel
serve
without
fee
but
the
court
refused
to
appoint
--
appoint
counsel
if
the
court
had
appointed
counsel,
they
could've
gotten
a
$250
state
paid
fee,
but
the
judge
held
that
they
waived
their
right
to
that
fee
by
filing
an
appearance
and
then
moving
to
be
appointed
instead
of
vice-versa.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes.
in
--
in
great
detail
although
as
i
say,
when
sergeant
aitken
changed
his
testimony
at
the
post-conviction
hearing,
while
new
like
was
cast
upon
the
circumstances.
aitken
at
the
murder
trial
denied
ever
seeing
reck
vomit
the
foot
square
pool
of
bright
red
blood
on
the
floor
of
the
handball
court.
mr.
donald
page
moore
the
--
the
case
has
been
redolent
of
publicity
for
years.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
an
immense
publicity.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes
your
honor,
but
it
was
almost
as
poor
as
the
petitioner
as
it
still
is.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
page
moore
well
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
sometimes
with
wines
and
he
shouldn't
do.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
i
don't'
know
the
precise
date.
it
was
approximately
1951.
mr.
donald
page
moore
oh
yes
your
honor
in
--
in
a
legal
sense
but
not
in
a
realistic
one.
you've
got
100
days
after
conviction
in
illinois
in
which
to
get
bill
of
exceptions
certified
by
the
trial
judge.
his
100
days
had
run.
he
could
no
longer
go
up
on
a
full
transcript
on
a
direct
review
when
the
post-conviction
act
was
adopted,
my
good
friend
and
very
able
adversary
mr.
wines
was
one
of
the
principles
draftsman,
the
legislature
very
generously
gave
a
three-year
period
in
which
people
who
have
already
been
convicted
might
invoke
that
statute
and
this
is
what
we
did
in
the
reck
case,
was
to
invoke
that
statute
after
it
was
passed.
but
had
there
been
post-conviction
at
--
there
would
have
been
no
remedy.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
your
honor.
that's
correct.
he
--
he
acted
promptly.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
would
raise
some
extremely
tricky
issues
about
what
is
an
adequate
non-federal
grounds
to
support
a
state
denial
of
relief
your
honor
and
(voice
overlap)
in
state
remedies.
mr.
donald
page
moore
but
if
the
state
relief
is
barred
because
of
the
state's
enforcement
of
a
reasonable
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
no,
your
honor,
except
that
there
might
have
been
the
bewildering
complexities
of
illinois
post-conviction
procedure
prior
to
marino
and
the
illinois
post-conviction
hearing
act
leave
me
even
at
this
date
most
uncertain
as
to
what
the
remedy
was
or
was
not
in
illinois.
if
there
were
no
remedy
in
illinois,
there
would
still
be
difficult
questions
i
think
mooney
notwithstanding.
mr.
donald
page
moore
no,
your
honor,
but
i
love
to
stand
here
and
talk
about
it.
mr.
donald
page
moore
oh,
probably
not
more
than
100
and
that
may
be
a
very
liberal
estimate
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
criminal
law
enforcement
in
illinois
in
--
in
the
30s
your
honor
was
--
was
a
pretty
desperate
thing
sometimes
as
i'm
sure
you
know.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
i
--
i
have
certainly
thought
about
it
a
great
deal
your
honor
and
certainly,
they're
entitled
to
--
to
try
them
over
again
if
--
if
they
get
the
evidence.
but
they
didn't
have
anything
in
1936
except
these
two
confessions.
there
isn't
a
scrap
of
corroboration
for
those
confessions.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
they
had
the
confederates
in
their
hands
present
at
court
who
had
already
been
convicted,
who
--
they
--
that
they
could've
made
a
deal
with
him
so
fast
as
they
did
in
an
appellee
case
to
put
them
on
the
stand,
they
didn't
do
it.
i
think
they
didn't
do
it,
because
they
didn't
think
that
the
story
of
the
confederates
could
stand
up
on
your
cross-examination.
but
for
whatever
reason,
the
state
is
--
is
free
to
try
again
and
of
course,
we'll
have
something
to
say
about
it
when
they
do.
mr.
donald
page
moore
one
is
dead
your
honor,
one
is
absolutely
discharged
after
doing
his
time,
one
remains
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
pardon?
mr.
donald
page
moore
no,
livingston
got
30
years
your
honor
and
he's
out.
he's
on
the
street.
(inaudible)
is
dead,
nash
is
down
and
(inaudible).
mr.
donald
page
moore
three
of
them
were
19,
livingston
was
17
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
thank
you.
