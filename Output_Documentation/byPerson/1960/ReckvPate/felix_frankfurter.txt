justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
moore,
may
i
cover
you
to
state
however
briefly
but
--
but
adequately,
on
the
basis
of
what
material
--
what
materials
were
before
the
district
judge,
on
the
basis
of
which
he
concluded
what
he
did
and
therefore
that
was
the
only
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
acted,
i
take
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i'm
thought
about.
now
what
was
--
what
was
before
the
district
court
after
the
trial
court,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
got
through
with
the
case
and
it
got
into
the
federal
court
according
to
the
qualification
of
our
or
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
suggestion
of
our
denial
of
certiorari?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
there
was
no
record.
he
couldn't
get,
but
there
was
a
record,
but
he
couldn't
get
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
not
quarrelling
regarding
the
verity
of
the
record
that
would
be
--
that
was
produced,
however
made
up
before
the
federal
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
was
anything
in
addition
before
the
--
any
new
testimony
taken?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
request
for
it
and
denied?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
did
you
stand,
were
you
counsel
before
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
stand
on
the
record
as
satisfactorily
assembled?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
we
have
here
a
case
of
a
disposition
of
the
matter
before
the
--
the
federal
habeas
corpus
court
on
the
basis
and
the
exclusive
basis
on
what
was
before
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
there
was
no
proceeding
before
the
judge
in
camera
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
part
of
the
jury's
presence
on
the
admissibility
of
the
confession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
on
the
question
of
admissibility
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thing
and
the
only
thing,
but
the
--
from
your
point
of
view
the
--
the
adequate
thing
that
was
before
the
federal
habeas
corpus
district
court
was
the
true
record
of
the
trial
in
its
entirety.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh!
did
that
go
into
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
--
was
the
new
testimony
regarding
the
confession
claimed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
all
events
--
all
events
we
have
here
at
case
in
which
you
seek
review
on
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
acted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
you
make
no
claim
as
to
the
procedural
aspects
before
the
federal
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
understand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
wines.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
contest
this
dispute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
i
correctly
understand
mr.
moore
to
say
that
when
the
case
came
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
record
before
it
was
merely
the
records
before
the
trial
judge
outside
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
still
think
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
him
(voice
overlap)
question.
as
i
understood
him,
they
were
given
even
on
the
post
--
post-conviction
proceedings,
they
only
had
the
record
before
--
on
the
question
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
they
--
it
would
be
strange
if
they'd
the
record
before
--
they
wouldn't
have
had
at
the
post-conviction
proceedings.
as
i
understood
it,
the
case
went
up
merely
on
the
admissibility
--
on
the
record
of
admissibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
the
reason
i
raise
this
question,
therefore,
whatever
else
may
be
true
of
the
--
of
the
strength
of
your
argument,
that
there
was
a
finding
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
do
i
correctly
understand
like
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
examines
the
fact
to
the
murder
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
you
a
right
to
argue
that
the
supreme
court
made
an
independent
examination
of
voluntariness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
it
be
true,
like
mr.
moore
led
me
to
believe
that
mr.
moore
understands
the
fact
to
be
--
i
didn't
mean
to
make
any
invidious
remark
of
course,
if
it
be
a
fact
that
there
was
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
on
the
question
of
voluntariness
merely
the
proceeding
on
the
initial
proceedings
for
admissibility,
then
they
couldn't
have
passed
or
didn't
pass
--
or
passed
inadequately,
on
the
total
thing
that
appeared
after
the
confession
again
was
made
an
issue
at
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know
--
that's
a
question
of
fact,
mr.
wines
and
we
ought
not
to
--
there
ought
not
to
be
conflict
among
us
lawyers
whether
in
fact
the
finding
of
voluntariness
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
was
on
the
basis
of
the
total
record
that
was
before
the
district
court
in
this
case,
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
and
it's
now
before
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
was
extended,
would
--
would
qualify
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
think,
in
a
significant
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
reach
of
the
--
of
the
de
novo
determination
by
the
supreme
court
of
--
of
illinois.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
therefore
that
determination
was
on
a
limited
record,
so
far
as
the
present
posture
of
the
case
exists.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
that
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
merits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
was
--
when
did
the
post-conviction
of
hearing
begin?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
pre-briefing
or
post-briefing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
it
--
did
it
did
appear?
how
he
came
to
know
pre-briefing?
does
it
appear
in
any
of
this
record
why
you
indicated
something
but
not
--
really
not
need?
why
no
step
was
taken
between
from
1936
until
1952?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
it
doesn't
explain
why
--
didn't
write
a
letter
for
the
court
that
is
not
limited
to
writing
relief
on
this
court
or
funds
in
this
court
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
making
a
point
though,
i'm
just
curious.i'm
curious
whenever
there's
a
great
led
of
time
between
a
crime
and
its
ultimate
destination
of
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
asked
what
got
in
going
in
1952,
does
it
appear?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
--
was
there
a
good
of
publicity
about
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
the
crime
--
at
the
contemporaneously
with
the
crime.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
a
good
deal
of
publicity?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
him,
at
this
time,
in
1936
unless,
i'm
wrong,
i
think
you
know
something
about
it?
it
was
a
very
active
civil
liberties
union
in
chicago,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it
doesn't
require
money
happily.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
requires
any
to
your
knowledge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
i
don't
know
it
very
well
to
yourself
from
your
own
experience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
except
in
the
federal
court,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it
was
(inaudible)
it
was
clear
if
there
is
no
state
relief
that
you
can
go
into
the
federal
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
before
the
illinois
post-conviction
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
such
motive
relief,
was
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
questions
i'm
asking
aren't
relevant
to
the
merits
of
the
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
like
to
know
what
your
forecast
is
as
to
how
many
more
cases
there
are
potentially
in
the
illinois
prisons
of
a
conviction
being
reviewed
in
this
court
1961,
on
the
basis
of
a
crime
of
1936.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
call
that
not
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
say
mr
--
did
i
understand
that
you
say
that
the
confederates
are
all
on
--
are
also
under
a
life
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
in
life
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
he
in
life
sentence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
were
all
below
--
they
were
all
less
than
21
years
old,
these
three
