mr.
william
c.
wines
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
your
honors.
i
shall
argue
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
warden
and
illinois
in
full
recognition
that
this
court
will
make
its
own
appraisal,
at
least
from
the
uncontradicted
facts
in
the
record
as
to
whether
the
two
confessions
admitted
into
petitioner's
trial
were
voluntary
or
were
the
product
of
coercion.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
spared
the
necessity
for
discussing
any
question
whether
this
court
should
weigh
conflicting
testimony
in
the
trial
court
by
the
very
candid
opening
three
lines
of
the
reply
brief
in
which,
if
i
may
read
them,
petitioner
says,
“respondents,”
that's
we,
“urges
that
this
court
should
not
weigh
disputed
testimony
in
deciding
whether
petitioner's
confessions
were
the
product
of
psychological
coercion.
petitioner
agrees
--
show
that
there
is
not
even
an
attempt
to
impose
upon
this
court
the
burden
of
as
saying
contradictory
testimony.”
now,
if
the
court
please,
with
those
observations,
i
should
like
if
i
may
again
have
the
indulgence
of
the
chief
justice
to
read
not
of
course
as
authoritative
on
this
court
because
the
language
that
i
would
read
would
beg
and
not
answer
the
question
that's
before
the
court,
if
i
were
to
read
it
as
conclusive,
but
i
should
like
to
read
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
language
of
that
court,
judge
duffy
dissenting
of
course,
“that
besides
the
ultimate
question
that
petitioner
presses
upon
this
court
on
this
certiorari.
i
--
the
transcript
is
not
printed
in
this
case,
but
i
am
reading
from
page
21
of
the
state's
blue
bound
printed
brief
and
the
citation
is
254
f.2d
253.
the
court
says,
“invoking
the
aid
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states,
reck
now
contends
that
his
confessions
were
the
product
of
coercion,
citing
his
lengthy
detention
incommunicado
and
the
illness
which
developed
during
that
period
of
time.”
this
is
the
language
that
distills
the
essence
of
the
court's
holding.
we
are
convinced,
however,
that
the
evidence
proves
that
none
of
the
treatment
which
he,
that's
a
petitioner,
received
while
he
was
being
detained
prior
to
saturday
afternoon
produced
produthe
confessions
by
reck
while
he
became
ill
when
captain
aitken
on
friday
night
probing
they
accused
him
of
the
peacock
killing.
his
rugged
determination
to
seem
nothing
to
reveal
the
--
involvement
in
that
affair
had
prevented
the
authorities
from
obtaining
any
incriminatory
admission
from
him
in
regard
to
the
crime
until
saturday
afternoon
in
the
office
of
the
state's
attorney.
until
then
reck,
the
strong
man
of
the
group
had
stood
fast
and
on
this
occasion
was
only
the
realization
that
goeth
and
nash
had
confessed
the
peacock
killing
and
had
implicated
him
and
had
in
the
presence
of
crowley,
the
assistant
prosecutor
at
that
time,
called
upon
reck
to
tell
holding
crowley,
the
truth
about
it.
“you
know
you
were
there
and
you
know
we
are
not
lying
about
it.”
that
is
not
quoting
crowley,
that's
the
other
boys
that
reck
realized
that
quoting
from
this
court's
opinion
in
stein
against
new
york,
“the
dance
was
over
and
the
time
had
come
to
pay
the
business
and
the
ball's
rotations.”
that
your
honors
did
not
regard
those
sentences
as
conclusive
as
quite
evident
from
the
fact
that
certiorari
has
been
granted
and
my
argument
will
be
addressed
to
supporting
that
conclusion
by
two
of
the
three
judges
of
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
before
addressing
the
evidence,
i
think
it
is
of
more
than
passing
importance
to
remind
your
honors
that
reviewing
cases
from
50
states
and
the
federal
jurisdictions,
it
escapes
your
honors'
memory
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
unlike
many
reviewing
courts,
will
reverse
a
case
even
though
there
is
no
error
in
the
record
of
any
kind,
even
though
there
is
sufficient
evidence
standing
alone
to
sustain
the
conviction,
if
that
court,
weighing
for
itself
though
to
be
sure
upon
a
printed
or
typewritten
record,
finds
that
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
a
conviction
beyond
all
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
not
the
criterion
of
appellate
reviewing
criminal
cases
in
many
jurisdictions,
but
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
regularly
and
repeatedly
reverses
convictions
for
no
other
reason
and
that
of
it
isn't
convinced
that
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
conviction
as
a
pure
question
of
fact.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
except
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
question
whether
it
was
a
product
of
coercion
or
voluntary
is
also
a
question
of
fact.
i
mentioned
this
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
--
well,
if
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
--
i
--
with
the
utmost
difference
and
respect
for
your
honor
and
the
court,
i
submit
that
although
question
of
the
voluntary
character
of
a
confession
is
a
very
different
question
from
the
question
of
the
guilt
of
the
defendant.
and
those
who
did
not
know
that
before
certainly
know
it
since
your
honors'
decision
in
the
rogers
case
of
the
20th
of
this
month,
i
do
submit
i
mention
this
only
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
supreme
court
of
illinois
when
it
held
that
this
confession
was
voluntary
and
not
coerced,
expressed
its
own
independent
“judgment”
on
that
question
of
fact.
and
that
was
a
question
of
fact
which
if
resolved
against
the
state
would
exclude
this
confession
and
vitiate
this
--
this
conviction.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
yes.
unlike
what
i
believe
is
the
new
york
practice.
i
--
i
shouldn't
guess
about
that
particularly
when
i'm
not
asked,
but
at
least
in
illinois
when
it
is
claimed
--
well
even
if
it
isn't
claimed,
that
a
confession
is
involuntary,
the
court
first
hears
evidence.
he
normally
doesn't
hear
it
in
chambers.
he
hears
it
in
open
court.
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
the
jury
is
excluded.
mr.
william
c.
wines
burden
of
--
of
convincing
the
judge
first
outside
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
proving
it
twice,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
repeat
at
--
no,
it's
done
this
way,
your
honor.
the
jury
is
first
excluded.
the
judge
and
everybody
else
remains
in
the
courtroom.
it's
part
of
the
public
trial.
newspaper
reporters
if
there
are
such,
audience,
counsel,
court
stenographer,
anyone
who
cares
to
be
there.
the
state
then
puts
on
the
witnesses
first,
before
there's
any
objection
who
testifies
that
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
confession
was
taken.
they
are
subject
to
cross-examination
at
that
time,
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury.
if
the
judge
believes
that
the
confession
was
voluntary,
i'm
not
absolutely
certain
whether
he
has
to
be
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
the
jury
does
when
they
hear
it.
if
he
believes
that
it's
involuntary,
he
just
says,
“objection
sustained.
go
ahead
without
this
confession
or
you
can't
draft
the
directed
verdict.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
oh
yes
and
does.
mr.
william
c.
wines
my
understanding
is
that
he
can,
but
i
don't
have
the
authorities
at
hand,
but
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
my
assumption
is
yes.
now,
then
after
the
judge
has
had
this
trial,
if
he
thinks
the
confession
is
relevant,
the
jury
is
then
brought
back
into
the
courtroom.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
reading
the
stenographic
transcript
or
playing
back
a
tape
recording.
the
question
of
voluntariness
is
then
tried
de
novo
before
the
jury.
the
same
witnesses
testify.
if
they
testify
differently,
they
testify
differently,
but
they
testify.
they
testify
for
the
state.
of
course,
the
defendant
on
that
occasion
doesn't
testify
at
that
time,
but
he
does
if
he
takes
the
stand
when
--
and
the
jury
is
instructed
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
proof,
upon
the
state
to
prove
the
voluntary
character
of
the
confession.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
yes.
without
any
doubt
or
question
and
petitioner
doesn't
suggest
that
any
other
practice
was
pursued.
mr.
william
c.
wines
my
recollection
is
that
they're
instructed
to
disregard
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
by
not
find
the
defendant
not
guilty
even
though
he
is
guilty.
you
could
have
a
case
where
the
proof
of
guilt
was
demonstratively
clear
without
a
confession
and
yet
there
was
clearly
an
extorted
confession
and
i
know
of
no
authority
for
instructing
the
illinois
jury
that
they
have
to
reward
the
defendant
by
an
acquittal,
nor
have
i
ever
heard
of
a
special
interrogatory,
nor
have
i
ever
heard
of
one
being
refused
because
they
never
have
heard
of
ones
being
requested.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.

no,
your

mr.

i'm

mr.

i
am

mr.

mr.
william

well,
now

mr.
william
c.

i'm
very
anxious
to
check
my
own
records.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
of
course.
mr.
william
c.
wines
of
course.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
correct.
my
recollection
is
as
is
mr.
moore's
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
not
make
a
de
novo
determination
of
voluntariness,
but
did
it
only
upon
the
evidence
preliminary.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
wines
now
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
however,
very
conscientiously
canvassed
this
case
and
in
one
way,
i
think
the
petitioner
suffers
in
this
case
because
he
has
in
mr.
moore,
such
a
good
lawyer.
every
fact
that
could
passively
be
brought
out
in
petitioner's
favor
has
been
brought
out
by
mr.
moore
in
his
really
superlatively
good
briefs
in
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
this
court,
without
any
distortion
or
unfairness
to
the
state.
it's
a
remarkably
good
job
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
benefit
of
the
always
emphatically
expressed
views
of
that
court's
senior
judge,
judge
duffy,
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
so
these
questions
have
been
canvassed.
now,
the
fact
is
as
appears
from
the
language
that
i
read
to
you,
that
this
defendant
made
two
confessions.
he
was
--
although
the
psychiatrist
says
he
cried
easily,
he
very
resolutely
withstood
this
questioning
until
he
was
confronted
by
the
admissions
of
three
other
boys
that
they
were
guilty.
then
he
immediately,
not
after
long
and
really
torture
confessed.
this
illness
according
the
state's
evidence,
came
on
him
not
after
torture,
but
as
soon
as
the
--
dr.
peacock's
murder
was
mentioned.
dr.
peacock,
a
physician,
had
been
summoned
by
telephone
calls
saying
that
a
child
was
ill.
dr.
peacock
was
a
pediatrician.
the
address
was
a
dark
one
and
he
was
beaten
to
death.
these
boys
were
arrested
for
bicycle
thefts.
suspicion
turned
upon
them
and
it
wasn't
until
three
of
them
confessed
and
implicated
this
defendant
that
he
confessed.
in
that
case,
other
facts
are
reminiscent
although
not
identical
with
the
stein
case.
stein
was
older,
but
the
facts
were
different.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
i
think
they
were.
you
remember
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
may
have
passed
20.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
no
--
no
older
--
no
fake
and
leading
a
gang
of
a
--
of
a
child
criminals
at
all.
and
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
we
assign
error
--
we
argue
in
this
brief
that
the
district
--
that
although
the
district
court's
judgment
is
in
our
favor,
the
findings
upon
which
it
rests
are
clearly
erroneous.
we
challenge
it
in
just
so
many
words
and
in
just
so
many
terms
and
the
court
of
appeals
took
that
view
although
it
didn't
express
it.
judge
campbell's
opinion
is
a
--
one
of
the
most
honest,
forthright
and
self-revelatory
documents
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
the
form
of
a
judge's
opinion.
i
shall
discuss
it
a
little
more
after
the
noon
recess.
suffice
it
to
say
at
the
moment
that
he
does
find
no
physical
coercion.
he
finds
the
psychological
coercion
that
would
have
offended
this
court's
constitutional
norms
as
uttered
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
later
in
decisions
after
this
case.
i
should
like
to
discuss
judge
campbell's
opinion
later.
mr.
william
c.
wines
commenting
upon
the
self-revealing
opinion
of
judge
campbell,
our
senior
district
judge
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
judge
campbell's
opinion
which
is
quite
long
finds
that
there
was
no
physical
coercion.
finds
that
there
was
psychological
coercion,
find
--
holds
that
according
to
what
he
deems
to
have
been
the
criteria
of
due
process
in
this
area
in
1936.
the
confession
must
fully
received,
says,
that
he
recognizes
that
the
concept
of
due
process
has
been
expanded
in
this
area
and
others
since
1936.
matt
holds
that
this
case
should
be
judged
by
the
constitutional
peanuts
and
doctrines
of
1936.
he
says
this
and
i
asked
the
chief
justice's
permission
to
read
some
six
lines
to
inform
the
court
without
either
adopting
or
disclaiming
the
contents.
he
says,
“certainly
a
judge
owes
a
duty
to
society
to
apply
the
law
impartially
but
it
seems
monstrous
when
discharge
of
such
a
duty
results
and
in
endangering
that
same
society.
it
cannot
be
denied
that
the
rights
of
the
individual
must
be
protected
but
can
we
not
achieve
civilized
standards
or
procedure
without
the
necessity
of
turning
dangers,
criminals,
loose
upon
society,
says
that
it
is
his
finding
that
believes
that
if
petitioner
is
discharged,
he
will
commit
another
crime
that
it
will
be
on
his
judge
campbell's
conscience
if
that
occurs
and
he
holds,
i
think
for
the
first
time
in
the
annals
of
federal
jurisprudence
that
due
process
does
not
require
the
discharge
of
a
dangerous
man
even
if
his
conviction
was
infected
by
what
would
deny
due
process.
mr.
william
c.
wines
he
says
in
this
opinion
that
it
requires
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
be
quashed
that's
what
he
says.
i
am
just
explaining
neither
adopting
nor
disclaiming
a
rationale
of
the
district
judge,
i
think
he
may
admit
to
hold
recurred
of
the
text
of
the
constitution
which
says
that
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
will
not
be
suspended
except
when
whether
is
it
war
or
rebellion,
or
the
perfect
safe
--
public
safety
may
require
and
then
he
thinks
that
this
is
a
case
where
in
the
public
safety
so
requires
and
therefore
suspends
a
writ
that
isn't
what
he
says
but
that
would
be
list
of
textual
apologetic
based
on
the
letter
with
the
constitution
for
what
he
does.
now,
the
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
command
the
point
of
view
to
what
--
for
what
it
is
worth
in
your
honor's
opinion.
i
don't
argue
it,
no.
i
merely
--

no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
and
we
discussed
that
in
the
opening
paragraph
of
our
brief
for
this
reason.
the
--
your
honor's
rules
of
civil
procedure
provide
that
findings
of
a
trier
of
the
fact
shall
not
be
set
aside
unless
they
are
clearly
erroneous
adding
the
language
for
having
do
regard
for
the
trier's
ability
to
see
and
hear
are
the
witnesses.
that
is
in
the
rule.
judge
campbell,
did
read
more
of
the
record
than
did
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
i
have
confirmed
that
and
that
is
correct.
but
he
saw
no
more
witnesses
than
--
did
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
nor
then
your
honors
have
seen
nor
we'll
see
in
this
case.
and
we
do
make
the
point
briefly
but
we
think
it's
clear
that
when
no
federal
court
has
seen
or
heard
any
witnesses,
the
clearly
erroneous
rule
has
a
--
an
entirely
different
content
and
aspect
from
what
it
has
when
the
time
honored
function
of
seeing
and
hearing
witnesses
has
occurred
in
the
judgment
under
review.
before
i
conclude,
i
am
very
anxious
to
say
that
without
assimilating
the
cases
factually
because
there
are
differences.
we
place
a
principle
or
reliance
on
stein
against
new
york
and
on
lisenba
against
california.
in
the
lisenba
case,
lisenba
made
a
confession
of
guilt
of
murder
under
circumstances
that
all
nine
of
the
then
members
of
this
court
said
denied
due
process
all
nine
of
them
said.
after
he
had
made
that
confession,
however,
and
i'll
admit
after
talking
to
a
lawyer
which
did
not
occur
in
this
case,
so
i'll
admit
that
lisenba
was
an
older
and
mentally
more
alert
and
aware
defendant
in
this
man.
he
was
confronted
by
the
dumbing
confession
of
a
codefendant
implicating.
he
then
made
a
confession
in
which
he
adopted
and
reiterated
the
confession
that
this
court
had
held
was
obtained
without
due
process
and
a
majority
of
this
court
held
not
without
dissent
to
be
sure
what
a
majority
of
this
court
held.
that
voluntarily,
confession
would
sustain
his
--
his
conviction
even
though
he
had
previously
made
it
involuntary
when
and
in
this
case,
the
evidence
shows
that
petitioner
made
two
confessions,
the
second
confession
he
made
to
a
group
of
civilians
who
were
neither
prosecutors,
policeman
or
public
officers,
they
were
composed
of
the
foreman
of
prior
illinois
cook
county,
grand
juries
and
a
group
of
medical
men.
to
be
sure,
the
medical
men
weren't
there
as
doctors,
they
made
no
examination.
but
what
happened
was
this,
he
was
called
in.
we
say
that
the
jury
could
draw
and
this
court
should
not
disturb
the
inference
that
he
could
then
and
would
have
if
this
confession
had
not
been
voluntary
when
asked,
said,
"well,
i
know
i
didn't
do
it.
they
made
me
confess
to
this
crime."
none
of
the
doctors
observed
any
of
the
psychological
stigmata
in
his
discussion
that
are
supposed
to
vitiate
the
confession.
we
say
that
this
case
resented
only
a
question
of
fact
that
there
is
adequate
basis
in
the
record
to
sustain
the
findings
of
a
juries
and
courts
that
have
held
this
confession
to
be
voluntary
and
that
therefore,
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
your
honor
i
had
--
i
--
i
have
really
covered
the
points
that
i
--
that
i
intended
to
cover
and
i
can
summarize
them
but
thank
you
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
your
honor,
i
think
that
i'll
conclude
here.
