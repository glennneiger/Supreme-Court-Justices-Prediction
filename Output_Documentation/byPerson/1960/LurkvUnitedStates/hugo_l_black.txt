well
that's
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
he's
a
de
facto
judge,
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
we
know
--
how
do
we
know
that
de
factos
wouldn't
stop
or
how
--
why
should
we
decide
this
constitutional
question
on
the
basis
that
judge
jackson
might
continue
the
trial
cases,
maybe
they
would
stop
assigning
him
or
maybe
he
did
decide
not
to
try
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
might
decide
to
try
it
them,
how
do
we
know
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
one
of
the
points
i
was
making
was
that
if
you
agree
that
the
action
cannot
be
challenged,
because
of
the
de
facto
judges.
how
can
we
know
how
long
this
practice
would
continue
if
ever?
it
might
stop,
it
might
become
all
moot.
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
–
by
avoiding
the
constitutional
issue,
we
would
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
permanently,
might
we
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
it's
–
(voice
overlap)
if
it
can't
be
waived
for
the
count
of
a
de
facto
judge,
why
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
might
be,
might
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
a
piece
of
the
de
facto
judge,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
by
the
next
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that
would
conclude
the
question,
determine
the
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
--
i
hate
the
bother
your
argument
because
we're
short
with
that.
i
would
like
to
understand
exactly,
suppose
congress
were
to
make
--
provide
that
the
members
of
interstate
commerce
commission
should
be
judges
for
life,
would
that
make
them
bad?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
under
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
gave
them
life
tenure?
