mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
directed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
and
it
raises
an
important
and
a
somewhat
baffling
question
of
judicial
administration,
a
criminal
appellate
justice
particularly
with
reference
to
the
right
of
indigent
defendants
to
carry
forward
their
appeals
in
forma
pauperis
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
in
order
to
appreciate
the
problem
as
it
has
unfolded
in
this
case,
i
think
it
well
to
describe
very
briefly
the
procedural
course
which
this
case
has
taken
from
the
time
of
the
trial
up
to
the
supreme
court.
now,
the
petitioner,
benny
lurk
was
tried
and
convicted
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
the
crime
of
robbery.
a
felony
is
defined
in
the
district
of
columbia
court.
during
the
trial,
he
was
represented
by
a
court-appointed
attorney
who,
after
the
trial
and
after
the
sentence
of
judgment
of
conviction
had
been
entered,
withdrew
from
the
case
with
the
approval
of
the
trial
court.
the
petitioner,
thereupon,
filed
with
the
trial
court
an
application
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
from
the
conviction.
the
trial
judge
denied
that
application
with
the
notation
that
the
appeal
was
not
taken
in
good
faith
and
that
it
was
frivolous.
petitioner,
thereafter,
filed
another
application,
this
time
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
he
requested
leave
to
file
an
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
and
made
certain
allegations
of
a
very
summering
nature
as
to
certain
errors
which
allegedly
had
occurred
during
the
trial.
it
was
at
that
point
that
the
court
of
appeals
appointed
me
to
represent
this
petitioner
and
directed
me
to
file
a
memorandum
in
support
of
the
petition
which
had
been
filed
pro
se.
my
preliminary
examination
of
the
matter,
of
course,
was
limited
by
the
fact
that
i
had
no
knowledge
whatever
--
what
had
occurred
at
the
trial
and
a
trial
transcript
not
being
available.
i
was
confined
to
determining
as
best
i
could
from
available
persons,
namely,
the
petitioner
and
his
trial
counsel
what
had
happened
at
the
trial.
as
a
result
of
that
examination,
i
was
convinced
that
i
could
not
conscientiously
represent
the
petitioner
and
report
back
to
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
any
basis
for
this
appeal,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
were
any
non-frivolous
or
reviewable
issues
which
would
entitle
this
petitioner
to
pursue
his
appeal
in
forma
pauperis.
furthermore,
i
was
not
convinced
that
--
nor
could
i
represent
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
i
was
convinced
that
the
trial
had
been
completely
free
of
all
possible
reversible
or
prejudicial
errors
in
the
trial.
therefore,
i
made
a
motion
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
to
have
the
transcript
of
the
trial
produced
at
the
expense
of
the
government.
and
over
the
objection
of
the
united
states,
that
motion
was
granted
and
a
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings
was
furnished
at
the
expense
of
the
united
states.
thereupon,
i
was
able
to
determine
whether
or
not,
in
my
mind,
there
was
any
basis
for
pursuing
this
appeal.
and
in
so
attempting
to
present
the
position
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
felt
it
was
obligatory
on
me
to
try
to
follow
the
standards
of
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
which
had
been
set
forth
by
this
court
unanimously
in
ellis
against
the
united
states
in
356
united
states.
now,
very
briefly
that
case
held
that
the
standard
for
determining
whether
to
grant
or
deny
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
depends
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
petitioner
and
the
---
under
section
1915
(a)
of
title
28
u.s.c.
and
that
that
good
faith
is
to
be
determined
in
--
by
virtue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
non-frivolous
issue
presented.
and
the
court
was
very
decisive
in
spelling
out
the
fact
that
if
any
non-frivolous
issue
is
presented,
the
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
must
be
granted.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
believe
about
100
pages
or
so.
it's
on
file
with
the
clerk's
office.
it
was
the
only
copy
produced
and
i
do
not
have
at
present
with
me
at
this
point.
mr.
davis
tells
me
it
was
75
pages.
i
don't
think
the
trial
lasted
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
if
that
long.
now,
the
court
in
the
ellis
case
was
also
careful
to
point
out
that
in
determining
what
is
non-frivolous,
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
convert
the
standard
of
non-frivolousness
into
a
requirement
of
any
--
showing
of
any
particular
degree
of
merit.
so
based
upon
those
propositions,
i
attempted
to
present
to
the
court
of
appeals
two
issues
which
i
conceived
to
be
non-frivolous
in
nature.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
that
--
it
hasn't
--
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
has
held
in
prior
case
that
that
type
of
certificate
is
subject
to
review
and
overruling
an
effect
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
procedure
has
developed,
and
i
assume
generally
although
at
least
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
that
you
can
file
a
de
novo
application
for
leave
to
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
in
effect
six-reversal
of
that
district
judge's
certification.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
it
was.
it
was
an
independent
new
application
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
right,
your
honor
and
that
application
before
the
court
of
appeals
appears
at
page
8
of
the
record
which
is
if
you
will
see
signed
by
the
petitioner
himself.
i
assume
that
somebody
helped
him
draw
that
up
but,
at
least
he
did
not
have
any
counsel
or
record
at
the
point
of
doing
that.
now,
the
two
non-frivolous
issues
i
sought
to
raise
involved,
as
i
say,
were
two
in
nature.one
of
which,
the
first
of
which
grew
out
of
the
--
of
my
examination
of
the
trial
transcript
and
it
was
the
only
way
in
which
i
could
have
discovered
that
such
an
issue
possibly
existed
that
warranted
review.
that
issue,
of
course,
involved
four
or
five
references
in
the
course
of
the
trial
to
the
fact
that
the
complaining
witness
and
benny
lurk,
at
one
time,
served
time
together
in
the
occoquan
workhouse.
and
i
submitted
that
in
as
much
as
the
petitioner
had
never
taken
the
stand,
that
this
might
well
present
a
very
serious
question
is
to
whether
or
not
these
references
to
the
petitioner's
prior
criminal
incarceration
might
not
have
unduly
prejudice
to
jury
and
then
it
also
involved,
was
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
in
light
of
those
various
references
had
taken
adequate
precautions
at
the
time
the
various
references
were
made
and
in
his
final
instructions
to
the
jury.
and
in
light
of
cases
which
i
cited
in
a
memorandum
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
felt
that
these
were
--
these
were
at
least
non-frivolous
issues
and
that
the
issues
were
also
present
as
to
whether
or
not
the
failure
of
appointed
counsel
to
take
an
exception
to
what
the
judge
had
done,
was
cons
--
was
allowed
this
issue
to
be
perpetuated
under
the
plain
error
rule
so
as
to
be
reviewable
by
the
court
of
appeals.
all
of
those
things
i
submitted
were
implicit
in
these
facts
growing
out
of
the
record
and
i
felt
presented
a
bona
fide,
a
good
faith
a
non-frivolous
issue.
the
other
issue
i
raised,
and
this
of
course
did
not
in
anyway
depend
upon
the
availability
of
the
trial
transcript
since
it
was
obvious
as
of
the
record
in
the
district
court
was
the
growing
out
of
the
fact
that
the
presiding
judge
at
the
trial,
the
judge
who
entered
the
judgement
of
conviction
was
judge
joseph
r.
jackson,
a
retired
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
who
was
assigned
or
designated
to
seat
on
the
district
court
for
the
year
1960
pursuant
to
the
assignment
statute
294
(d)
of
title
28.
now,
the
--
those
were
the
issues
presented
and
i
submit
that
they
were
non-frivolous
within
any
meaning
of
the
ellis
standard.
now,
comes
the
interesting
part
insofar
as
the
development
of
this
case
in
light
of
the
ellis
standards.
the
government,
of
course,
filed
a
two
page
opposition
to
this
memorandum
in
which
no
mention
whatsoever
was
made
of
the
ellis
case.
no
denial
was
made
that
either
issue
was
frivolous
in
nature
or
the
leave
to
appeal
should
be
denied
under
section
1915
because
they
did
not
meet
the
standards
of
that
section
as
interpreted
in
the
ellis
case,
instead,
the
united
states
argued
in
lawyer
like
terms
and
illegitimate
legal
argument
that
neither
issue
had
any
merit
that
i
was
wrong
in
both
the
first
issue
as
to
the
prior
criminal
record
references
and
that
moreover,
judge
jackson
did
have
the
right
to
sit
on
this
court
by
assignments
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
the
constitutional
issue
as
i
had
presented
it.
but
i
emphasized
the
important
point,
and
this
i
put
forth
in
a
reply
memorandum
that
we
are
not
under
the
ellis
case
at
this
point
in
an
in
forma
pauperis
appeal
dealing
with
the
merits
or
the
ultimate
substance
of
either
issue.
the
only
question
opened
at
this
juncture
of
an
in
forma
pauperis
appeal
is
whether
or
not
there
had
been
presented
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner
any
non-frivolous
issue.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
i've
been
appointed
to
a
number
of
these
cases.
i
have
observed
any
number
of
other
instances
of
counsels
who
had
been
appointed
in
this
exact
type
of
situation,
and
i
assume
you
referred
to
it
by
two-step
to
the
business.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
that
has
a
great
deal
of
merits
to
it
and
it
would
resolve
a
great
deal
of
the
problems
that
now
exist
here
in
this
circuit
here.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
exactly
right.
i
maintain
that
if
the
--
if
the
government
had
simply
conceded
that
these
were
non-frivolous
issues,
we
would
have
had
this
case
briefed,
argued
and
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
four,
five,
six
months
ago.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
it
would
be
opened
at
anytime
for
the
government
to
move
to
dismiss
an
appeal
as
frivolous
or
to
summerly
affirm
at
anytime.
but
under
section
1915
and
as
interpreted
in
the
ellis
case,
i
don't
believe
that
we
can
--
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
justified
in
making
a
summary
affirmance
or
disposition.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that,
i've
tried
to
set
forth
in
my
brief
during
the
past
year
according
to
the
statistics
from
the
clerk's
office
of
the
court
of
appeals.
i've
set
those
forth
at
page
23
of
my
brief,
main
brief.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
during
the
1960
fiscal
year
and
that
was
from
july
1,
1959
to
june
30,
1960,
there
were
approximately
43
in
forma
pauperis
petitions
were
filed
seeking
to
appeal
directly
from
criminal
convictions.
now,
those
were
original
applications
in
the
court
of
appeals
were
appeal
had
presumably
been
denied
by
the
district
court.
and
therefore,
they
came
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
they
did
in
--
as
petitioner
here
did.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
am
not
aware
that
--
that
that
practice
has
developed
in
this
circuit.
i
believe
that
if
these
prisoners
who
do
this
on
their
own
and
that
usually
is
the
case,
let's
get
their
advice
from
the
clerk's
office
or
from
someone
that
the
proper
way
to
proceed
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
to
file
a
new
de
novo
application
in
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
you
do
not
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
don't
have
those
--
a
case
that
--
as
to
those
statistics
collected
except
that
i
am
certain
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
district
of
columbia
criminal
jurisdiction
is
so
much
wider
than
any
other
circuit,
that
there
are
many
more
applications
here
than
there
are
in
any
other
circuit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
--
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
don't
think
that
--
that
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
in
the
--
in
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
--
in
the
ordinary
criminal
case,
unless
you
get
an
extension
of
time,
there'll
be
a
half
hour
allowed
on
each
side.
mr.
eugene
gressman
an
hour
of
oral
argument.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
there
would
be
presumably
the
time
spent
in
preparing
this
initial
memoranda
and
the
opposition
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
not
the
court's
time
granted
but
it
is
counsel's
time
when
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
the
--
at
the
same
time,
the
--
the
court
has
to
take
a
good
deal
of
time,
i
presume,
in
determining
these
motions
to
which
come
up
to
it.
i
don't
know
how
much
it
--
it's
indeterminate
amount
of
time.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
except
that
the
way
we
--
the
way
under
the
present
procedure.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
true.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
and
--
and
certainly,
you
have
to
weigh
the
amount
of
time
you
--
you
point
out
as
to
oral
argument
against
the
time
spent
by
the
court
setting
as
emotions
court
as
it
does
in
these
preliminary
matters
going
over
this
memoranda.
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
is
no
oral
argument
generally
speaking
on
these
motions.
mr.
eugene
gressman
in
--
in
terms
of
oral
--
in
terms
of
oral
argument,
that
is
correct.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
will
concede
and
--
and
the
fact
it's
--
it's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
--
it's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
and
in
matter
of
fact,
some
of
these
cases
where
there
have
been
complicated
issues
raised
or
--
or
some
important
issue
of
law
involved,
they
have
a
filed
petitions
for
rehearing
en
banc.
and
the
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
granted
rehearing
en
banc
and
then
some
of
those,
they
--
they
may
have
granted
oral
argument
even,
i'm
not
certain
about
that.
but
i
have
not
been
involved
or
aware
directly
of
any
case
which
oral
argument
was
granted
except
that
i
do
know
that
they
have
frequently
taken
the
time
and
energy
of
the
entire
court
in
considering
these
papers
and
memoranda.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
i
think
congress
is
--
has
indicated
what
the
procedure
would
be
in
the
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
says
that
they
shall
be
granted
if
they
have
presented
in
good
faith.
and
in
the
ellis
case,
interpreting
section
1915,
spells
that
out
even
further
and
says
that
the
petition
must
be
granted
if
a
non-previllous
issue
is
presented.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
assumes
that
if
it
is
non-frivolous,
it
must
be
granted.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
is
in
entirely
true
of
course
but,
once
that
determination
has
been
reached,
it
then
does
not
become
the
function
of
the
court
just
to
--
to
decide
whether
we
would
like
to
take
this
case
or
not
or
whether
it
would
be
determined
--
involved
a
great
deal
of
our
time
as
the
government
here
suggest.
it
certainly
is
not
the
equivalent
of
this
court's
certiorari
jurisdiction.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
that
as
long
as
you
grant
oral
argument
to
any
class
of
cases,
there
has
--
would
have
to
be
some
extremely
overriding
reason
for
curtailing
that
as
to
any
other
class.
mr.
eugene
gressman
certainly.
but
the
court
of
appeals
here
and
i
think
most
courts
of
appeals
have
a
specified
time
limits
for
oral
argument,
which
are
applicable
in
all
cases.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
don't
deny
there
are
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
consistent
with
any
applicable
federal
statutes
of
which
i'm
not
immediately
aware
of
any.
but
to
determine
within
the
grounds
of
good
and
sound
discretion,
what
time
shall
be
allowed
for
oral
argument
and
conceivably
as
you
point
out,
to
limit
it.
and
certainly,
it's
it's
recognized
and
it
always
has
been
that
they
don't
need
to
have
oral
argument
in
a
given
case.
and
that's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
that
is
true.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
there
are
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
there
are
many
cases
where
the
court
has
eliminated
oral
argument
completely
by
the
technique
of
the
dismissal
or
summary
dismissal
on
grounds
of
being
frivolous
or
on
some
other
ground,
mootness
or
anything
else
that
may
occur.
no.
i
certainly
not
maintaining
that
in
each
and
every
case,
there
is
an
absolute
constitutional
or
statutory
right
to
oral
argument.
what
i
am
maintaining
is,
that
congress
in
section
1915
and
in
the
interpretation
of
that
section
in
the
ellis
case
has
set
the
standard,
has
set
a
procedure
to
be
followed
at
this
stage
at
least
of
an
in
forma
pauperis
application.
and
that
is
a
very
simple
standard.
simply
says
that
once
a
non-frivolous
issue
has
been
raised
and
has
determined
to
be
non-frivolous,
then
the
appeal
must
go
forward
and
presumably
go
forward
through
the
full
briefing
and
the
oral
argument
stage.
now,
the
--
as
i
have
pointed
out,
the
court
of
appeals
in
light
of
the
memoranda
submitted
and
they
expressly
stated
that
that
was
apparently
the
sole
basis
for
acting.
on
the
basis
of
the
memoranda
opposing
and
supporting
the
petition,
the
petition
itself
--
the
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
was
denied.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
they
did
at
that
point.
i
have
secured
the
transcript
previously
to
this
point
and
while
they
didn't
mention
it.
mr.
eugene
gressman
they
--
they
had
it
before
them,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right,
yes.
and
references
were
made
in
the
memoranda
particularly
in
mind
to
--
and
quotations
were
made
just
that
i
have
in
my
brief
before
this
court
quotations
from
that
trial
transcript.
now,
either
after
filed
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner,
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
claiming
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
erred
in
denying
this
application
for
leave
to
file
and
that
in
that
denial,
based
as
it
was
upon
the
memoranda
submitted,
that
it
had
failed
to
follow
the
applicable
standards
of
section
1915
and
the
standards
set
forth
in
this
--
in
the
ellis
case
in
this
court.
now,
again,
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
opposition
filed
by
the
solicitor
general
in
this
court
did
not
meet
the
issues
as
i
would
--
had
presented
them.
the
questions
presented
being
solely
in
terms
of
this
failure
to
follow
section
1915
in
the
ellis
case,
there
is
not
one
word
in
the
government's
opposition
which
even
mentioned
section
1915
or
section
--
or
the
ellis
case.
"instead,"
said
the
government,
and
this
i
learned
for
the
first
time,
i
--
"the
petitioner
in
effect,"
said
the
government,
"had
been
granted
the
appeal
and
that
the
appeal
had
been
considered
on
the
merits
because
of
the
fact
that
the
transcript
had
been
supplied
and
the
issues
had
been
briefed
on
the
merits."
"therefore,"
said
the
solicitor
general,
"this
petition
should
be
considered
by
this
court
on
the
strength
of
the
substantive
issues
presented"
namely,
the
two
issues
involving
the
constitutionality
of
judge
jackson's
assignment
and
the
other
issue
being
the
one
of
various
references
to
the
prior
criminal
record.
now,
i
would
say
that
on
either
theory,
the
one
which
i
had
adopted
in
analyzing
the
court
of
appeals'
action
were
the
one
that
the
government
presented
to
this
court
that
there
has
been
an
egregious
error
committed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
denying
this
particular
petition
for
leave
to
file.
because
under
my
analysis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
action,
what
they
did
and
they
--
was
in
effect
to
adopt
the
arguments
or
recognize
the
merit
of
the
arguments
presented
by
the
government
in
the
lower
court,
an
argument
which
went
to
the
merits,
the
substance
of
these
two
issues.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
your
honor.
i
do
--
don't
believe
they
do
and
in
fact,
this
court
said
in
ellis
that
is
exactly
what
they
must
not
do.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
it's
more
than
on
use
of
the
word
frivolous,
your
honor.
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
--
there
has
to
be,
first,
a
recognition
of
what
the
word
frivolous
means
and
then
a
proper
application
of
that
term.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
this
again
depends
on
a
definition
of
the
term
frivolous
which
aspect
i
have
tried
to
set
forth
in
my
brief.
but
to
answer
your
question
directly,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
court
in
the
ellis
said
that
frivolousness
is
not
to
be
equated
with
any
particular
degree
of
merit
that
there
is
a
distinction
to
be
made.
and
when
we
look
at
the
concept
of
frivolousness
and
the
--
the
cross
reference
in
the
ellis
case
to
rule
39
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
i
think
we
begin
to
see
what
is
really
meant
by
the
term
frivolous.
and
the
leading
decision
under
rule
39
(a)
which
involves
of
course
prepaid
appeals,
the
ordinary
criminal
appeal.
this
court's
decision
in
the
united
states
against
johnson
sets
forth
the
fact
that
an
appeal,
a
prepaid
appeal
may
be
dismissed
under
rule
39
(a)
if
it
presents
a
non-reviewable
issue,
an
issue
that
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
say
that
that
is
a
substantial
degree
removed
from
any
question
of
the
ultimate
merit
of
an
issue
that
you
can
have
a
non-frivolous
issue
which
turns
out
to
be
completely
without
merit
upon
a
full
examination
of
it.
now,
for
example,
take
any
case
at
random,
take
this
court's
decision
a
few
weeks
ago
in
the
costello
case.
now,
that
turned
out
to
be
without
merit
in
light
of
this
court's
determination
of
it
and
yet,
it
could
have
been
said
at
some
initial
stage
in
that
proceeding
that
this
was
a
frivolous
appeal
that
costello
was
raising.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
--
i
agree
your
honor
that
--
that
this
becomes
a
matter
of
degree
that
it's
--
it's
very
low
end
of
the
totem
pole.
you're
going
to
reach
the
point
where
judges
will
all
agree
that
this
particular
petition
is
frivolous
in
nature
that
the
issue
raised
is
frivolous.
but
i
say,
it's
a
very
low
place
in
the
scale
of
values
and
judgment
because
the
--
the
section
1915
as
which
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
says
that
it
does
not
get
up
into
any
particular
area
of
merit
so
that
it
must
be
some
area
below
a
discussion
or
an
evaluation
in
terms
of
its
ultimate
merit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
those
assigned
--
then
speaking
of
that
particular
case
for,
the
ellis
case
did
involve
that
--
that
very
serious
problem
about
the
function
of
assigned
counsel.
but
those
assigned
counsel
did
submit
to
the
court
of
appeals,
a
very
extensive
memorandum
you
will
recall.
the
error
they
made
in
--
in
that
memorandum
which
led
to
the
problem
was
a
fact
that
they
warmed
up
by
saying
that
this
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
arrest,
i
believe
it
was,
had
no
merit
and
therefore
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
true
enough.
but
they
also
did
discuss
and
gave
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
as
much
insight
and
--
into
the
issue
that
they
raised
in
terms
of
the
facts
and
the
various
propositions
involved
in
it,
the
only
error
they
made
and
this
--
i
think
it
points
up
at
the
very
meaning
of
the
ellis
case
as
this
court
opinion
demonstrate.
the
error
that
they
made
and
i
think
the
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
made
was
that
having
had
this
amount
of
insight
given
to
them
into
the
issue,
it
was
resolved
by
this
appointed
counsel
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
already
in
that
case
in
terms
of
the
merit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
except
that
in
the
ellis
opinion
here,
this
court
not
only
said
that
was
not
the
function
of
counsel
in
effect
but
it
also
said
it
was
not
the
function
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
resolve
the
petition
or
leave
to
appeal
in
terms
of
any
particular
degree
of
merit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
i
suppose
that's
always
the
--
the
problem
you
do
have
in
these
cases.
mr.
eugene
gressman
but
this
is
one
of
the
very
serious
problems
i
think
that
confronts
an
appointed
counsel
in
these
cases
as
to
how
he
is
going
to
demonstrate
this
non-frivolousness
of
the
issue
he
seeks
to
raise
in
the
abstract
as
you
point
out
without
knowing
exactly
what
the
government's
position
on
it
is
or
what
--
what
it
is
that
someone
else
might
think
is
frivolous
about
the
issue.
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
except
that
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
there
isn't
at
least
on
one
issue,
a
much
reasonable
ground
for
difference
of
opinion
as
to
its
frivolousness.
now,
i
might
just
add
a
comment
or
two
about
the
government's
position
in
this
point
as
revealed
in
its
brief
to
this
court.
the
government
as
i
read
their
brief
would
confine
section
1915
and
the
ellis
doctrine
which
we
have
been
discussing
to
counsel's
application
for
a
transcript
to
the
trial.
now,
this,
i
cannot
understand
neither
the
language
of
section
1915
nor
the
ellis
case
itself
in
its
facts
or
in
its
decisions
by
this
court.
it
anyway
supports
a
limitation
of
section
1915
to
counsel's
application
for
the
transcript.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
an
impossible
burden
or
an
impossible
test
to
apply
in
situations
such
as
in
this
case
where
i
didn't
know
what
the
issues
were
that
might
arise
out
of
the
transcript
and
it
was
for
that
precise
reason
that
i
ask
for
the
transcript
and
already
determined
if
there
were
any
non-frivolous
issues,
and
how
you
could
determine
and
apply
a
non-frivolous
test
to
my
application
for
the
transcript
is
beyond
it.
i
simply
told
the
court
of
appeals
that
i
don't
know
what
these
cases
about.
i
can't
adequately
represent
the
petitioner
without
a
transcript.
now,
ellis
doctrines
and
section
1915
certainly
do
not
apply
to
that
application.
now,
on
the
other
hand,
once
a
transcript
has
been
supplied
as
it
was
in
this
case,
and
briefs
or
memoranda
are
submitted
by
appointed
counsel
and
by
the
government,
then
the
solicitor
general
says,
“then
you
do
no
longer
apply
ellis.
you
no
longer
section
1915."
then
it
is
entirely
up
to
the
court
to
determine
in
its
discretion
whether
or
not
they
feel
the
issues
presented
and
developed
in
the
memoranda
are
sufficiently
importance
to
warrant
taking
up
any
further
amount
of
the
court's
time
in
briefing
--
reading
briefs
or
in
hearing
oral
argument.
now,
i
submit
that
is
a
complete
provision
of
section
1915.
it
converts
into
what
is
in
effect,
a
certiorari
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
--
by
the
cases
that
the
solicitor
general
brief
cite
in
--
in
this
court
where
this
court
on
petition
for
certiorari
are
on
jurisdictional
statements,
take
summary
action
of
affirming
or
dismissing
or
denying
the
decision
below
has
absolutely
no
relevance
to
the
function
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
section
1915.
it
is
not
a
certiorari
jurisdiction
for
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
bound
to
imply
entirely
different
standards
under
section
1915
and
this
court
is
called
upon
to
exercise
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
hear
oral
argument
in
the
cases
that
come
before.
and
the
congress
has
spoken
very
explicitly
that
at
this
juncture
up
to
and
through
oral
argument
and
that's
what
section
1915
covers.
the
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
that
you
are
not
to
cut
off
the
petitioner
from
further
proceeding
on
his
appeal
unless
and
until
it
has
been
determined
that
the
issues
he
seeks
to
raise
are
frivolous
in
nature.
if
they
are
non-frivolous,
then
there
is
no
discretion
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
cut
off
further
processing
of
that
appeal.
now,
i
submit
that
limit
breaking
up
the
appellate
process
of
this
indigent
appellants
into
these
two
categories
that
this
government
suggests
would
result
in
--
on
a
gross
discrimination
against
paupers
who
seek
to
appeal
because
the
prepaid
appellants
who
are
subject
only
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
in
their
appeal
rights
are
not
cut
off
from
pursuing
their
appeal
simply
because
the
court
doesn't
want
to
take
time
to
listen
to
their
briefs,
read
their
briefs
or
listen
to
their
oral
argument.
there
is
as
i
say,
not
the
--
the
discretionary
type
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
exist
up
here.
now,
i
only
wanted
to
briefly
refer
to
the
two
issues
that
i
raised
below
and
to
emphasize
that
whatever
the
standards
may
be,
the
standard
of
non-frivolousness
even
go
beyond
and
if
you
will
into
standards
of
substantiality,
i
would
submit
that
there
can
be
no
question.
but
what
the
two
issues
which
were
sought
to
be
raised
on
behalf
of
petitioner
meet
those
standards
and
that
they
were
of
such
substantial
nature
as
to
compel
with
the
warrant,
full
review
and
determination
on
the
merits
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
we've
already
discussed
some
length
the
--
the
first
issue
raised.
i
won't
go
into
at
any
further
except
to
say
that
--
that
which
the
government
has
not
denied
that
precisely
this
same
type
of
issue,
these
references
to
prior
criminal
record
during
the
course
of
a
trial
was
precisely
the
kind
of
issue
which
this
court
in
farley
against
united
states
said
was
not
frivolous
in
nature.
so
that
i
believe
that
that
decision
alone
is
proof
of
the
non-frivolous
nature
under
section
1915
of
this
particular
type
of
issue.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
arguments
engaged
in
by
the
government
in
their
brief
seeking
to
demonstrate
its
alleged
frivolity
only
add
to
its
non-frivolous
nature
because
i
have
answers
to
each
and
every
one
of
the
contentions
made
by
the
government.
i
don't
think
that
these
issues
are
so
clear
cut,
one
way
or
the
other
at
this
point.
i
think
they
need
and
deserve
fuller
exploration
in
briefing
an
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits.
now,
the
other
issue
raised,
of
course,
i
believe
not
even
the
government
as
at
anytime
asserted
that
it
was
frivolous
in
nature.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
constitutional
question
which
has
never
been
resolved
by
this
court
or
by
any
other
court,
a
constitutional
question
that
had
eventually
resulted
in
the
government
of
the
united
states
asking
this
court
to
overrule
one,
if
not
more
two
or
three
decisions
of
this
court
by
its
very
statement
is
non-frivolous
issue.
now,
i
do
not
--
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
until
my
rebuttal
time
fuller
discussion
of
this
issue
except
to
point
out
several
factors
concerning
this
issue.
i
might
say
that
it
is
an
issue
that
was
initially
raised
and
inverted
to
in
the
bakelite
opinion
in
its
references
to
the
fact
that
there
may
be
constitutional
objections
to
the
assignment
of
constitutional
court
judges
to
legislative
courts.
it
seems
to
me
that
by
an
even
greater
token,
there
may
be
constitutional
objections
to
the
assignment
of
legislative
court
judges
to
sit
on
constitutional
courts.
but
there
was
no
attempt
in
bakelite
or
in
any
other
decision
to
meet
or
to
resolve
that
issue.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
know
of
no
challenge
that
has
ever
been
made
in
terms
of
this
type
of
assignment.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that's
the
reverse
situation.
i
think
there
might
in
--
to
my
way,
i
think
there
might
be
less
objection
to
that
and
there
is
to
the
legislative
court
judge
sitting
on
the
constitutional
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
checked
only
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
to
determine
how
often
this
type
of
assignment
had
occurred
and
he
told
me
that
judge
jackson
is
the
only
judge
that
he
knows
of
who
--
at
least
in
a
retired
status
has
ever
been
assigned
to
sit
on
an
article
iii
court.
there
was
a
case
several
years
ago,
the
jepson
case
i
believe
where
judge
jackson
and
one
other
judge
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
both
of
whom
were
then
sitting
on
that
court
where
assigned
to
the
district
court
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
sit
on
this
antitrust
three-judge
court
suit.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
i
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
and
now
--
maybe
i
didn't
understand
the
full
import
of
your
question.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no,
i
think
there
--
there's
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
it
is
a
--
it's
simply
a
fact,
your
honor.
i'm
not
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
at
this
juncture.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
--
as
i
say,
there's
apparently
in
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
questions.
i
don't
think
there
have
been
many
assignments
made
of
so-called
legislative
court
judges,
whatever
their
status,
retired
or
otherwise
to
sit
on
constitutional
court.
so,
i
don't
think
the
occasion
has
much
a
reason.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
the
other
--
there
is
one
instance
where
i
think
i
noted
in
my
brief
in
the
irish
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
where
a
judge
from
hawaii
was
assigned
to
sit
on
the
ninth
circuit
and
actually
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
which
was
not
objected
to
but
it
did
call
forth
an
adverse
comment
in
our
lower
view
but
apart
from
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
mr.
eugene
gressman
a
territorial
court?
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
the
only
one
as
i
say
was
this
ninth
circuit.
that
was
within
his
own
circuit
so
to
speak.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor
at
all.
this
is
a
type
of
thing
i
suppose
it's
--
would
have
to
be
a
very
careful
examination
of
the
records
in
the
administrative
office
over
the
period
of
years
to
determine
the
assignments
that
have
been
in
fact
made
but--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
there
is
a
related
situation
in
the
sense
of
assignment
of
court
of
claims
judges
to
sit
in
various
circuits
around
the
country.
that
has
occurred
although
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
well
--
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
truly
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
absolutely,
your
honor.
i
don't
question
that
fact
nor
do
i
question
the
--
the
booth
case
which
said
that
a
judge
once
he
retires
is
entitled
to
the
article
iii
protection
against
any
diminution
in
his
salary.
and
his
retirement
pay,
said
that
for
purposes
of
the
retirement
statute,
purposes
of
being
a
judge
in
effect,
he
remains
the
same
after
his
retirement.
i
don't
object
to
that,
your
honor.
what
i
do
say
is
this
in
relation
to
this
case,
that
the
fact
that
judge
jackson
had
retired
has
this
much
significance
at
least.
it
adds
an
additional
factor
and
additional
constitutional
problem
in
this
case
for
this
reason
that
as
i
view
a
judge's
powers,
they
argue
right
primarily
and
perhaps
exclusively
from
the
powers
and
functions
of
the
court
to
which
he
is
appointed
and
if
during
his
10-year
on
that
court
up
to
and
through
--
to
the
point
of
his
retirement,
the
functions
and
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
are
never
changed.
and
he
then
retires
and
then
subsequently,
there
is
an
effort
to
add
to
the
functions
or
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
i
think
it
is
an
arguable
point
and
--
at
least
an
unresolved
question
constitutionally
as
to
whether
or
not
that
retired
judge
acquires
additional
powers
and
duties
and
status
if
you
will
by
virtue
of
a
change
made
in
the
function
or
the
nature
of
the
court
subsequent
to
his
retirement.
i
think
there
is
a
problem
there
as
to
whether
a
man
in
his
retired
status
can
acquire
something
different
than
what
he
took
with
him
when
he
retired
from
that
court.
i
don't
think
that
question
has
ever
been
answered.
i
don't
think
the
booth
case
answers
that
problem.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
--
in
--
in
a
sense.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
of
course
in
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
the
addition
of
problem
whether
he'd
be
retired
or
not
as
to
whether
a
conversional
declaration
in
1958,
six
years
after
he
retires
but
let's
say
it
will
apply
equally
to
the
current
judges
of
the
court.
absence
any
real
change
in
the
nature
or
the
function
of
the
courts
or
any
attempt
to
change
its
--
its
origin
or
status,
whether
that
in
himself
can
change
or
add
to
the
functions
of
the
judge
in
a
retired
status
or
in
an
active
status.
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
basic
question
involved
by
this
type
of
legislation.
and
that
too
has
never
been
resolved
by
this
or
any
other
court.
and
in
fact,
the
bakelite
case
very
clearly
warned
against
this
precise
type
of
legislation
which
was
adopted
by
congress
as
to
this
various
courts.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
have
never
thought
until
i
got
to
this
court
that
the
benny
lurk's
conviction
was
going
to
depend
upon
the
maintenance
or
the
overruling
of
the
bakelite
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
the
--
not
the
bakelite
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
no.
that
--
that
was
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
that
precise
court
judge
jackson
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
year
--
and
perhaps
your
honor
is
thinking
of
american
insurance
company
against
canter
in
1828
to
opinion
for
the
court
by
chief
judge
marshall
a
territorial
court
in
florida
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
which
i
think
had
a
limited
tenure
of
four
or
eight
years.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
right.
that
is
the
canter
case.
1928
is
the
one
that
originated
this
dichotomy
between
constitutional
and
legislative
courts
and
made
these
very
clear
distinctions
upon
which
they
cite
williams
and
o'daniels
subsequently
true
upon
in
formulating
a
status
of
the
court
of
claims,
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
the
district
of
the
columbia
courts.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
absolutely
not.
mr.
eugene
gressman
it's
--
well,
i
know
every
--
in
fact
the
other
commentator
has
so
said
that
and
the
--
the
fact
remains
that
--
that
those
decisions
are
on
the
books
today,
the
question,
i
submit,
has
a
very
great
substance
in
significance
as
to
whether
they
are
to
be
continued
and
what
the
effect
has
been
upon
the
status
of
those
courts
today.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
i,
at
the
very
least,
i
would
like
the
determination
that
this
issue
was
not
frivolous,
it's
whether
your
honor
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
the
way
the
issues
come
up
to
this
case
at
court
that
is
the
context
in
which
they
arrive
that
this
was
an
issue
which
should
have
been
resolved
in
the
first
instance
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
having
gotten
up
here
at
this
status
and
there
having
been
various
factors
in
this
matter,
which
i
think
this
court
is
fully
aware
of.
i
think
it
can
be
said
to
be
appropriate
if
your
honor
so
decide
to
resolve
this
question
now
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
at
least
the
constitutional
question.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
other
issue
would
be
raised.
i
think
it
falls
squarely
within
the
context
to
the
ellis
rule
and
that
there's
be
no
need
for
a
determination
on
that
issue
at
this
juncture
unless
your
honors
feel
that
it
has
been
--
that
there
is
some
reason
for
doing
so.
but
certainly,
the
government
has
come
up
here
with
a
full
scale
argument
on
this.
we
have
amicus
representation
on
the
behalf
of
the
judges
of
court
of
claims.
and
as
i
pointed
out,
the
court
of
appeals
has
upheld
all
appeals
arising
from
judge
jackson's
court
pending
possible
resolution
of
this
question
in
this
court.
so
that,
those
are
matters
which
i
submit
may
well
require
or
at
least
justify
a
resolution
here
rather
than
resubmitting
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
question
which
was
certainly
have
to
come
back
up
here
promptly
again
in
view
of
the
forces
that
have
been
put
into
motion.
i
might
say
that
moroseness
has
been
stirred
up
by
this.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
that
is
true.
if
you
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
no,
your
honor.
let
me
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
if
your
--
if
your
honors
were
disposed
to
decide
the
constitutional
question
favorable
to
--
to
me
--
to
my
position,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
would
necessarily,
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief,
involved
a
determination
that
the
judgment
rendered
was
void.
there
would
be
no
further
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
if
it
goes
against
me
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
think
that
that
is
--
has
not
been
resolved
properly
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
i
don't
think
that
they
properly
apply
the
ellis
standard
to
that
issue.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
that
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
that
i'm
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
it's
--
i
think
this
--
this
constitutional
question,
as
i
said,
raised
a
great
--
a
lot
of
questions
of
importance.
but
i
think
the
ellis
point
is
also
equally
important
in
a
sense
of
the
administration
of
this
in
forma
pauperis
petitions
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
--
do
you
mean
to
have
this
court
decide
the
merits
of
this
record
or
evidentiary
problem?
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
--
i
would
say
to
this
extent,
it
would
be
appropriate
perhaps
just
to
have
a
determination
made
that
this
is
not
a
frivolous
issue
and
that
therefore
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
allow
the
appeal
to
go
forward.
mr.
eugene
gressman
probably
not,
your
honors,
since
that
would
involve
basically
a
determination
of
local
--
district
of
columbia
law.
mr.
eugene
gressman
not
by
me
--
[laughter]
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
i
would
first
point
out
that
every
so
called
legislative
court
as
determined
by
this
court
in
the
series
of
decisions
as
a
reason
out
of
some
act
of
congress.
all
the
territorial
courts,
the
court
of
military
appeals,
all
have
a
reason
out
of
acts
of
congress,
acts
of
the
legislatures.
what
this
court
has
defined
to
be
a
legislative
court
is
a
court
which
has
been
determined
to
they
had
been
created
by
congress
in
execution
basically
of
its
article
i
powers
rather
than
an
execution
of
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
under
article
iii.
and
when
this
court
held
in
bakelite
that
that
was
a
legislative
court,
this
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
it
was
same
in
effect
that
is
so
it
is
legislative
because
the
court
was
created
solely
to
execute
the
customs
and
the
tariff
powers
of
congress
under
article
i.
and
it
was
not
attempting
to
execute
the
power
to
decide
cases
and
controversies
within
the
--
and
other
function
areas
of
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
as
defined
in
article
iii.
so
that,
it's
--
it's
not
so
--
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
created
by
an
act
of
the
legislature
or
congress.
it's
a
question
what
power
--
what
article
of
the
constitution
was
congress
look
into
or
executing
when
it
did
create
a
particular
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
in
my
remaining
time
to
this
constitutional
issue
and
with
particular
reference
to
the
1958
declaration
by
congress.
parenthetically,
i
might
say
just
as
a
matter
of
clarity
of
the
proceeding
below
that
i
disagree
with
mr.
davis'
analysis
of
the
issue
that
i
sought
to
raise
there
in
these
constitutional
terms.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
memorandum
will
demonstrate
that
i
sought
to
erase
the
basic
constitutional
issue
which
has
been
fully
developed
before
the
court
in
the
briefs
before
it.
and
that
it
is
unfair
to
single
out
any
particular
argumentative
statement
that
may
have
been
made
and
seek
to
confine
that
in
terms
of
an
issue
raised.
in
fact,
i
think
this
demonstrates
better
than
anything
else
the
desirability
at
the
appellate
level
below,
of
having
an
opportunity
fully
to
brief
a
basic
constitutional
issue
such
as
this.
i
think
that
it's
unfair
to
confine
and
to
limit
what
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
terms
of
the
issue
before
it,
by
any
single
statement
that
might
have
been
made
and
particularly
with
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
retired
judge.
now
whether
that
has
any
significance
or
not,
remains
to
be
one
of
the
matters
to
be
considered
on
full
briefing
of
the
issue
which
has
never
occurred
until
we've
arrived
in
this
court.
now
with
reference
to
the
de
facto
doctrine,
which
is
the
first
line
of
defense
taken
by
the
united
states
here,
i
will
say
only
this.
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
yesterday
pointed
out
the
--
the
real
answer
to
the
de
facto
defense
in
this
case
and
that
is,
as
i
have
developed
in
my
reply
brief
at
length,
that
the
de
facto
doctrine
does
not
apply.
it
does
not
help
where
there
is
a
constitutional
or
a
statutory
reason
why
a
judge
cannot
sit
in
a
particular
type
of
case
and
that
is
what
we
have
alleged
here.
what
is
involved
here
is
the
claim
that
there
is
there
constitutional
prohibition
against
judge
jackson
sitting
in
an
article
iii
court.
and
when
that
type
of
claim
is
made,
something
that
goes
far
beyond
any
technical
defect
in
judge
jackson's
assignment
such
as
a
failure
to
file
his
assignment
with
the
office
of
the
clerk
of
the
district
court
or
to
–
to
--
a
failure
to
obey
some
technical
aspect
of
the
statutory
assignment
provisions,
but
where
we
have
this
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
the
inevitable
conclusion
to
which
this
argument
goes,
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
you
can
avoid
that.
i
mean
it's
either
one
or
the
other
and
the
--
the
cases
are
cited,
norton
against
shelby
county
says
precisely
that
where
the
--
there
is
a
constitutional
or
a
statutory
prohibition
against
a
judge
participating
in
the
case
and
these
--
this
was
the
case
that
the
--
the
solicitor
general
relied
on
last
term
in
the
american
foreign
steamship
case
in
order
to
avoid
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
that
case.
they
pointed
out
and
i
think
accurately
that
the
de
facto
doctrine
there
could
not
be
interjected
to
say
the
--
the
judgment
no
more
than
it
can
be
interjected
in
this
case,
i
submit.
now,
turning
to
the
1958
declaration
by
congress
which
has
been
described
as
irrevocable
declaration
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
irrevocable
about
any
declaration
by
congress
in
this
field
or
in
any
other
field.
what
congress
says
today,
it
can
change
tomorrow
and
the
whole
theory
is
that
the
--
in
fact,
that
history
has
demonstrated
how
congress
has
treated
this
court
on
and
off,
as
a
legislative
court
from
--
from
its
very
beginning.
in
1932,
congress
cut
the
salaries
of
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
an
obvious
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
legislative
court
and
this
court
sustained
it,
precisely
in
that
term.
mr.
eugene
gressman
pardon?
mr.
eugene
gressman
1932,
the
appropriation
act
of
1932,
which
was
in
the
midst
of
the
depression
and
they
cut
salaries
of
many
administrative
and
judicial
officials.
now,
that
was
the
--
it
gave
rise
to
the
williams
and
the
o'donoghue
litigation.
so
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
no
your
honor,
i
don't
think
they
can.
i
think
it
would
be
meaningless
gesture
just
as
it
was
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
constitutional
status
of
the
district
courts
or
the
courts
of
appeals
depends
upon
a
congressional
declaration
to
that
effect.
i
think
it
depends,
as
the
bakelite
case
pointed
out
it
does
not
depend
upon
the
expressed
or
the
over
legislative
intention.
it
--
the
true
test
that
this
court
unanimously
in
the
bakelite
case,
lies
in
the
power
under
which
the
court
was
created
and
in
the
jurisdiction
conferred.
and
it
is
ultimately
the
function
of
this
court
to
determine
under
what
power
those
courts
were
created
and
what
congress
says
as
to
its
article
iii
status
or
as
to
legislative
status,
particularly
at
a
subsequent
time
as
they
did
in
this
case,
is
absolutely
meaningless
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
bakelite
case
forecast
would
happen
and
which
was
declared
to
be
completely
without
relevance.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
because
congress
i
think
--
you
look
back
originally
to
wonder
what
congress
did
at
the
time
it
created
the
court.
now,
the
congress
in
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
congress
in
1958
is
no
--
certainly
no
better
judge
of
what
congress
in
1909
meant
to
do,
then
is
this
court
when
called
upon
to
interpret
the
power
under
which
the
court
was
created.
mr.
eugene
gressman
you
–
you
can
your
honor
if
congress
at
the
same
time
changes
the
nature
so
as
to
have
a
new
act
of
creation,
a
new
jurisdiction,
a
new
function,
a
new
scope
to
that
court,
but
congress
was
very
careful
to
point
out
here,
your
honor
that
we
are
in
way
changing
this
jurisdiction
or
the
function
or
the
scope
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
leaving
it
just
as
it
was
presumably
as
described
and
delineated
in
the
bakelite
case.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
if
i
--
i
don't
see
where
it
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
i
don't
think
that
--
that
congress
at
that
point
is
the
final
arbiter
of
what
was
created
in
1909
or
what
was
created
in
1854
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
the
--
the
facts
of
its
jurisdiction
and
--
and
its
nature,
negative
is
that
kind
of
an
interpretation
of
the
1958
act.
only
last
moth
the
court
claims
for
example,
issued
four
decisions
on
legislative
reference
from
congress
which
are
the
type
of
advisory
opinions
which
this
court
said
has
time
and
again
cannot
be
rendered
by
a
constitutional
court.
mr.
eugene
gressman
there
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
conceivable,
that
are
a
few
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
in
keller
against
potomac,
that's
right.
exactly,
your
honor,
but
the
--
that
has
been
described
in
the
o'donoghue
case
as
having
both
a
--
a
legislative
and
an
article
iii
status.
now,
there's
never
been
declared
that
there
is
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
although
that's
a
constitutional
interpretation
by
this
court,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
and
i
can
only
say
in
conclusion
that
as
senator
gore
stated
with
respect
to
this
very
type
of
jurisdiction
of
over
advisory
opinions
on
reference
from
congress.
in
1953
he
said
and
i
quoted
this
on
page
62
of
my
brief,
“and
i
think
it
epitomizes
the
ephemeral
nature
of
these
congressional
declarations
that
if
in
the
future,
the
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
had
refused
to
act
upon
congressional
reference
cases
on
grounds,
they
are
not
within
the
proper
scope
of
jurisdiction
of
the
constitutional
court,
i
suppose
the
simple
remedy
will
be
for
congress
to
re-designate
the
court
of
claims
as
a
legislative
court.”
now
i
submit
that
this
is
an
indication
of
the
view
and
i
think
a
legitimate
view
as
each
–
as
congress
views
it,
that
they
can
turn
the
constitutional
and
legislative
nature
of
these
courts
on
and
off
like
a
faucet.
mr.
eugene
gressman
i
do
not
believe
they
can,
your
honor.
mr.
eugene
gressman
that
is
true.
if
there
is
no
constitution
--
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
it
does
when
interpreting
the
constitution
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
eugene
gressman
well
that
–
that
a
full
re-examination
and
a
different
decision
of
course,
would
produce
a
different
law,
but
that
is
the
status
to
the
laws
as
exists
today,
your
honor.
thank
you.
