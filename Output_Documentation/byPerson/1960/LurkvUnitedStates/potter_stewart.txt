that's
what
was
done
here
mr.

justice

de
novo
application
for
leave

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
forma
pauperis
rather
than
an
appeal
from
a
denial
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
cumbersome
two-step
procedure
that
you've
been
describing
the
ordinary
way
of
doing
business
here?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
referring
to
this
based
on
my
own
experience,
as
a
circuit
judge
in
the
sixth
circuit,
after
we
--
in
that
court,
begins
in
the
johnson
case
and
(inaudible)
case,
if
i
have
the
right
names
in
mind.
justice
potter
stewart
perhaps
a
little
--
a
little
less
subtlety,
but
it
seems
to
me,
with
a
good
deal
of
more
practicality,
whenever
application
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
would
come
along
regardless
of
what
the
district
court
had
done,
we
simply
granted
it
and
set
it
down
for
argument
on
the
merits
on
appointed
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
say
--
and
really
you
save
time
in
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
after
argument,
if
you
decide
the
appeal
is
frivolous,
you
can
then
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
except
if
i'm
correct
that
the
procedure
i
suggested
saved
the
time
of
everybody
than
it
would
save
even
more
time
in
the
district
of
columbia
if
there
are
more

justice
potter

during
the
time
that
alaska
was

at
this
point,
the
usual
things
sent
up
article
iii
district
judges
from
the
continent
of
united
states
to
serve
up
there.
and
if
--
do
you
know
of
any
--
any
challenge
to
that?
justice

that
would
be
assigning

justice
potter

i
was
wondering
if
you
knew
--
if
anybody
ever
challenged
that
because
i
know
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
there
had
been
quite
a
few
the
other
way.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
--
you
don't
call
that
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
second
does
too.
justice
potter
stewart
i
again
--
i
never
understand
why
they
did
and
i
don't
frankly
understand
why
in
view
of
the
magnitude
of
the
case
load
here
why
this
court
doesn't
adopt
to
more
efficient
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
mr.
davis,
as
i
understand
it,
you
concede
that
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
now
made
as
contrasted
with
--
with
what
you're
telling
us
that
he
can
tie
himself
within
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
of
the
arguments
now
made,
this
is
not
a
frivolous
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
that
say
equivalent
to
confession
of
errors,
isn't
not,
that
this
appeal
should
not
have
been
dismissed?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
there
is
and
this
is
jurisdictional
question.
and
therefore,
one
i
assume
which
cannot
be
waived
and
which
can
be
raised
in
any
states
of
proceeding,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
perhaps,
they
were
let
into
it
by
--
by
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
there,
you
now
concede
there
--
there
is
a
question
involved
here
which
is
not
frivolous.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
a
question
which
is
jurisdiction,
is
that
correct?
those
are
my
words.
i'm
not
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
was
wondering
where
that
left
us.
if
they're
--
if
it
is
now
conceded
that
there
is
a
question
on
this
appeal
that
is
not
frivolous
whether
that
doesn't
end
the
matter
right
now
and
whether
we're
not,
we
just
shouldn't
set
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
--
it's
a
denial
of
motions
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
custom
court
of
the
court
of
customs?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
the
new
york,
the
customs
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it's
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
below,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
one
thing
the
tax
court
isn't
a
court
at
all
theoretically.
it's
not
even
a
legislative
court,
that's
true.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
sure
they
know
and
i
--
i
either
too
[laughter]
too
but
they
--
but
what
is
the
other
way,
the
expressions
of
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's,
of
course,
contrary
to
what
this
court
has
said
section
28
u.s.c.
1915
means.
you're
not
supposed
to
decide
a
case
on
the
merit
in
this
summary
way,
simply
be
--
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
doesn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
a
lawyer
and
a
filling
fee.
you're
supposed
to
decide
it
on
the
merits
in
the
way
you
decide
every
other
case
on
the
merits.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
these
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
decisions
upheld,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
--
how
many
cases
in
which
the
fees
have
been
filed
as
court
of
appeals
did
that?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
any,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
procedure
for
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
just
what
the
--
this
court
has
held
there
should
not
be.
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
separate
and
different
mechanism
for
pauper
cases
from
which
the
--
from
what
there
is
for
(inaudible)
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
speaking
as
one,
mr.
davis,
it
wasn't
here
when
these
cases
were
decided
and
who,
on
the
other
hand,
was
on
the
receiving
on
--
on
--
of
them
and
try
to
figure
out
the
best
way
to
--
to
exceed
what
we
understood
the
supreme
court
would
be
deciding.
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
davis
so
long
you
were
being
very
frank
this
morning,
let
me
say
that
with
respect
to
the
sixth
circuit,
i
have
no
idea
what
the
practice
is
there
now,
i
was
just
thinking
about
it,
as
to
what
at
least
my
practice
was
when
i
was
there
and
maybe
the
practice
there
is
now
quite
different
and
i
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
ordinary
rules
of
the
game
mr.
davis,
would
be
for
us
if
--
if
we
agree
with
what
--
now,
both
sides
of
this
controversy
can
see
that
there
is
a
non-frivolous
issue
involved
would
be
simply
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
tell
them
that,
wouldn't
that
be
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
hurry
the
result
of
complicated
constitutional
issue
that
may
never
come
up
in
this
case,
because
the
court
of
appeals
might
conceivably
reverse
it
on
the
--
on
the
evidentiary
point?
justice
potter
stewart
you
may
doubt
it,
but
if
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
is
--
is
right.
justice
potter
stewart
he
sat
on
the
silverman
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
which
came
to
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
davis
has
said
that
he's
been
sitting
for
four
years?
justice
potter
stewart
so
in
other
words,
he
was
sitting
when
his
court
was
a
legislative
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
was
not
until
three
years
ago
in
1958,
that
congress
purported
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
declare
that
this
was
a
--
that
the
--
his
court
was
an
article
iii
court,
isn't
that?
justice
potter
stewart
with
an
affirmation
that
it
always
has
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
used
to
be
a
court
called
the
commerce
court.
judge
mack
is
an
outstanding
member
of
that
court
--
and
served
at
the
abolition
of
that
court.
he
was
a
judge
without
a
court
and
he
sat
to
the
second
circuit,
seventh
circuit,
the
sixth
circuit.
was
the
commerce
court
a
statutory
court
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
without
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
left
as
judges
without
a
court,
but
they
had
been
retained.
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
you
know
mr.
gressman
that
congress
could
validly
declare
that
all
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
and
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
are
declared
to
be
legislative
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
what
they
did
yesterday,
they
can
do
tomorrow.
they
can
change
any
of
these
courts
back
to
