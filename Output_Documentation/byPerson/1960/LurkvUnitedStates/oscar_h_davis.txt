mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
threshold
question
of
the
--
whether
the
court
of
appeals
urged
under
28
u.s.c.
1915
in
denying
petitioner
further
leave
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis,
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
set
before
the
court
four
factors
which
i
think
are
important.
i
should
use
them
in
my
argument
but
they
are
not
arguments
in
themselves.
the
first
factor
is
that
this
case
and
the
problem
of
this
case
only
rises
where
the
district
court
has
denied
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
that
is
it
only
arises
where
the
district
court
has
denied
to
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis
where
the
district
court
grants
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
the
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
i
believe
elsewhere
is
to
treat
it
in
exactly
the
same
ways
as
a
prepaid
appeal
and
--
and
goes
forward
on
the
same
basis.
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
is.
i
haven't
checked
that's
why.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
what
--
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
you
--
you
start
with
the
premise
that
the
district
court
has
found
that
this
--
that
the
appeal
was
frivolous.
so
it
is
not
the
same
the
situation
as
where
--
it
all
--
it
doesn't
deal
with
all
indigent
appeals.
they
only
deal
with
indigent
appeals
whether
district
court
has
already
made
on
a
merit
of
termination.
the
second
factor
that
i'd
like
to
present
to
the
court
is,
is
that
there
is
a
special
situation
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
they
have
general
jurisdiction
of
local
crimes.
they
have
an
enormous
number
of
criminal
cases
as
compared
with
other
circuits.
they
are
larger
circuit
of
membership
but
they
have
an
enormous
number.
the
figures
that
i
have
jived
with
those
which
mr.
gressman
gives
to
the
court,
in
the
year
1960,
the
fiscal
year
1960,
the
--
i'm
told
that
the
forma
pauperis
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
that's
excluding
the
ones
where
the
district
court
granted,
just
the
ones
applied
to
the
court
of
appeals
are
191.
now,
most
of
those
were
collateral
attack,
section
2255
or
habeas
corpus
but
i
think
as
mr.
gressman
has
pointed
out
about
43
were
on
direct
appeal
from
the
criminal
conviction.
and
this
is
a
relatively
large
number
i
believe
with
--
in
comparison
to
--
to
the
other
circuits
in
the
country
which
dealing
with
federal
types
of
crimes.
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
though
i
haven't
made
a
thorough
search
from
recently
reported
cases,
i
would
say
that
at
least
the
first
eighth,
fifth
and
ninth
circuits
followed
the
same
practice
of
what
you
call
the
two-step
proceeding
as
far
as
they
reported
cases.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
think
so.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
this
brings
me
to
the
--
the
third
factor
that
i
want
to
mention
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
there
is
certainly
have
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr
chief
justice,
that
is
also
related
to
the
third
plan
which
i
have
to
make.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
those
cases
that
--
that
many
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
seen
were
cases
unlike
this
case
that
the
records
had
not
been
supplied,
counsel
had
not
taken
the
role
of
the
advocate
but
it
act
as
amicus.
counsel
had
not
filed
extensive
memoranda
as
this
counsel
did.
the
memoranda
which
mr.
gressman
filed
which
are
very
able
legal
documents
are
in
the
record
in
this
case.
and
--
and
the
court
will
be
able
to
see
that
they
compare
with
a
brief
on
the
merits
in
--
in
many
of
criminal
cases
of
this
non-complexity
in
the
--
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
there
have
not
been
many
cases
except
perhaps
in
the
present
term
mr.
chief
justice,
where
you
have
a
combination
of
a
counsel
who
has
acted
as
advocators
this
court
required
in
the
ellis
case
who
has
filed
as
completely
extensive,
a
memorandum
has
been
found
in
this
case,
where
the
full
record
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
record
is
only
75
pages
long,
and
the
--
and
the
case
was
not
a
complicated
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
is
right.
by
our
count
mr.
justice,
only
one
case
which
the
court
has
already
acted
upon
was
comparable
to
the
present
case
in
the
sense
that
counsel
had
acted
as
advocate.
there
has
been
a
--
a
record
transcribed
and
there
had
been
briefing
as
on
this
case.
there
are,
i
think,
a
number
of
pending
in
the
bosom
of
the
court
which
are
comparable
to
--
to
this
one.
so
that
it
--
to
repeat
myself,
i
think
that
this
case
is
different
from
the
other
cases
which
have
been
here
and
which
--
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
differed
upon.
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
mentioned
the
fact
of
dissents
and
sometimes
en
banc.
i
think,
there
had
been
dissents
in
some
cases
like
this
one
where
there
had
been
full
briefing.
but
most
of
those
were
cases
where
the
court
of
appeals
purported
to
act
under
1915,
section
1915
without
a
record
or
without
full
briefing
by
counsel
as
i
think
there
was
in
this
case.
so,
that
this
is
not
a
repetition
problems
that
you
had.
it's
--
it's
i
think
a
relatively
new
problem
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
chosen,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
as
the
other
circuits
have
chosen
to
follow
this
procedure
though
they
--
they
might
have
if
they
had
thought
it
desirable
followed
the
procedure
which
mr.
justice
steward
tells
us
was
followed
in
the
sixth
circuit.
but
we
think
it
was
within
their
allowable
discretion
in
the
administration
of
justice
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
particularly
in
view
of
the
kind
of
cases
they
deal
with
to
follow
this
kind
of
procedure.
and
the
last
general
facts
that
i
want
to
mention
was
raised
by
a
statement
of
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
our
position
is
here
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
at
the
precise
issues
which
counsel
raised.
and
of
course,
if
in
our
view,
counsel
has
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
its
judges
were
not
now
and
never
were
and
could
not
be
constitutional
judges.
i
think
it
would
be
right
that
we
could
not
say
that
we
had
to
follow
brief
at
this
length
and
called
it
non-frivolous.
but
in
our
view,
when
i
think
this
appears
clearly
if
you
read
both
the
original
memorandum
filed
by
mr.
gressman
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
particularly
his
reply
memorandum,
he
did
not
raise
that
issue
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
he
said
in
our
view
was,
"i
will
assume"
he
didn't
conceive,
he
said,
"i
will
assume
that
the
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
who
were
active
in
service
in
1958
when
congress
passed
the
statute
saying
that
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
a
constitutional
court."
i
will
assume
that
they
are
constitutional
judges
and
that
the
court
is
now
a
constitutional
article
iii
court.
i
will
assume
that.
what
my
only
position
is
as
--
as
we
read
his
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals
is,
that
judge
jackson
who
retired
in
1952
before
that
statute,
he
cannot
go
along
with
the
active
judges
or
the
judges
who
are
in
service
after
1958.
and
as
to
that
narrow
issue
which
was
the
issue
that
he
presented
to
the
court
of
appeal
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he
does
present
it
again.
his
main
brief
has
a
much
--
much
broader
argument.
but
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
contented
himself
with
that
argument
alone.
as
to
that
argument,
we
think
the
booth
case
is
decisive
that
a
federal
judge
who
retires
--
retires
from
active
service,
he
doesn't
retire
from
the
court.
and
if
you
will
assume
or
concede
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
the
other
judges
of
the
same
court,
the
court
customs
and
patent
appeals
are
article
iii
judges
in
the
court
is
an
article
iii
court
at
least
since
1958
that
you
have
necessary
conceded
under
the
rule.
the
principles
laid
down
by
this
court
and
particularly
enunciated
in
the
booth
case
that
judge
jackson
is
also
an
article
iii
judge
so
that
we
thought
and
on
that
issue
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
if
i
may
use
an
inelegant
expression,
"the
height
goes
along
with
the
hair."
the
retired
judge
has
the
same
position
as
the
active
judges
and
if
--
if
they
are
constitutional
judges
and
he's
a
retired
judge,
he
necessarily
has
the
same
characteristics
of
status.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
goes
to
the
question
of
de
facto
mr.
justice
douglas
but
on
the
--
on
the
argument
that
was
made
in
the
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
counsel,
it
was
simply
that
whatever
might
be
true
of
the
other
judges
of
the
court
since
1958
couldn't
be
true
of
judge
jackson
because
he
retired
before
1958,
retired
in
1952.
and
on
that
issue,
we
only
stand
at
page
and
a
half
mr.
justice
brennan
in
this
large
brief
of
ours.
and
i
think
it's
--
it's
conclusively
against
the
position
taken
the
by
mr.
gressman
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
in
this
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
most
certainly
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
because
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
properly
pass
upon
the
issues
raised
by
counsel.
but
as
i
--
if
--
if
counsel
restricts
themselves
to
an
issue
which
is
frivolous
and
substantial
or
unworthy
of
further
argument,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
can
properly
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
issues
presented
by
a
counsel.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
you
cannot
fault
the
court
of
appeals
for
--
for
deciding
on
the
basis
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
well,
i
--
i
would
think
that
it
is
a
question.
no,
i
don't
want
to
concede
that
because
we
have
the
argument
of
de
facto
which
i
might
outline
right
now
though.
it's
way
ahead
of
my
--
my
argument.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
i
--
i
do
not
think
that
--
that
the
court
--
you
can
reverse
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
of
fact
that
counsel
in
the
supreme
court
has
raised
an
issue
which
he
did
not
raise
below.
you
might
wish
to
decide
that
new
issue
with
yourselves
or
perhaps
in
--
in
your
discretion,
you
might
vacate
the
judgement
or
not
reverse
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
i
think
they
have
the
right
to
deny
a
motion
on
the
basis
of
the
issues
presented
to
them.
and
this
issue
in
our
view
is
not
presented
and
therefore,
they
acted
properly.
if
--
if
this
court
feels
and
we
think
it
should
that
the
broader
issue
is
--
is
appropriate
here
and
can
be
disposed
off,
we
think
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
dispose
of
the
issue
rather
than
to
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
particularly
since
it's
already
come
out
on
oral
argument.
it
would
have
to
come
back
here
anyway
and
i
--
it
is
doubtful
whether
on
an
issue
of
this
type,
an
issue
of
--
of
under
article
iii
further
like
could
--
would
be
appropriate
from
--
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
is
also
the
further
fact
to
which
has
been
mentioned
that
there
is
a
considerable
degree
of
interest
on
this
question.
and
considerable
number
of
pending
case
depending
on,
judge
jackson
has
been
sitting
regularly
in
the
--
in
the
district
court
here
for
two
years
i
believe
and
he
is
still
sitting.
judge
madden
has
been
sitting
in
the
various
courts
of
appeals.
i
believe
that
the
judge
of
the
customs
court
has
been
sitting
in
the
florida
district
court.
so,
then
it
is
a
current
problem
which
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
under
the
statute,
a
judge
of
the
customs
court
has
permitted
to
sit
on
a
district
(voice
overlap)--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
he
has
been
sitting
on
the
district
court
in
florida
as
i
understand.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
would
relate
to
an
enormous
number
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
difficulties
which
the
--
the
rule
of
this
court
that
the
retired
judge
has
the
same
status
as
the
active
judge
as
was
designed
to
opt
the
act.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
basic
difference
there
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
is
that
the
difference
in
the
term.
the
tax
court
judges
have
a
term
of
12
years.
and
--
and
the
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
since
the
creation
of
the
court
in
1909
have
had
life
tenure.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
since
the
creation
of
the
court
in
1909
have
had
life
tenure.
and
that
we
think
is
the
crucial
difference.
judge
jackson,
when
he
was
appointed
in
1937
or
1939,
was
appointed
for
a
life
term.
but
the
judges
of
the
tax
court
are
not
appointed
for
life
terms.
they're
appointed
for
terms
of
12
years.
i
would
doubt
though
of
course
it's
not
for
me
to
express
an
opinion
that
congress
could
establish
the
tax
court
as
a
constitutional
court
without
requiring
that
judges
be
appointed
for
--
for
life
term.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
would
doubt
very
much
whether
that
could
be
done
very
much.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
would
doubt
whether
--
by
even,
i
would
doubt
whether
they
could
extend
the
--
the
present
judges
provided.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
is
--
that
right,
mr.
--
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
that
isn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
don't
think
that
is
the
conclusive
answer
but
i
think
it
is
--
it
takes
a
long
way
to
the
answer.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
judges
of
the
tax
court
feel
quite
strongly
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
it's
still
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
they've
tried
cases
in
a
judicial
manner
as
this
court
has
set.
i
don't
want
to
admit
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
cases
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
are
not
all
judicial.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
no,
but
i
thought
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
--
if
i
would
have
time
mr.
chief
justice
and
certainly
in
our
brief,
i
would
say
to
you
that
i
think
that
today,
the
court
should
hold
that
all
the
procedures
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
are
judicial
that
though
the
court
indicated
to
the
contrary
back
in
1927
in
the
postum
cereal
case.
i
think
that
there
has
been
an
advance
in
the
law,
a
change
in
the
--
in
the
statutes
which
is
irrelevant
and
that
particularly
in
advance
in
--
in
the
law
which
would
lead
this
court
to
hold
if
the
issue
arose
before
it
agan,
that
those
were
judicial
proceedings.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no
i'm
not
referring
to
that.
i'm
referring
mr.
justice
douglas
to
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
postum
cereal
case
was
decided,
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
was
only
were
referring
to
the
fact.
in
the
williams
case,
the
court
of
claim
judges
were
considered
to
be
acting
judicially.
the
chief
justice
referred
to
the
fact
that
some
of
the
functions
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
were
held
not
to
be
judicial
in
--
in
--
in
the
--
particularly
in
the
postum
cereal
case
in
1927.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
that
is
the
same
question
as
to
whether
the
judge
--
the
court
is
an
article
iii
court
or
the
judges
are
judges
are
article
iii
judges.
i
think
it
has
a
bearing
out
of
it
but
there's
a
different
question
as
to
whether
the
functions
--
particular
functions
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
with
relation
to
patents
and
trademarks
are
administrative
or
non-judicial.
it's
not
the
same
question
as
whether
the
court
of
claims
is
a
--
an
article
iii
court.
i
think
there
has
a
bearing
on
it
but
they
are
different,
different
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
in
the
o'donoghue
case,
this
court
held
that
the
judges
of
the
court
--
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
were
article
iii
judges
who
held
their
position
if
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
the,
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
no
one
who's
gone
into
this
field
and
i'm
sure
many
of
the
justices
at
least
will
agree
or
feel
that
the
--
that
the
principles
are
not
clear
on
this
field
of
what
is
an
article
iii
court
and
what
is
an
article
iii
judge.
they
--
they're
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
is
mr.
justice
douglas,
[laughs]
because
the
guide
posts
are
not
as
clear
in
this
field
as
they
are
in
some
others.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
raises
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
here?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
think
that
the
petitioner
should
be
stand
convicted
of
this
crime
if
the
broader
issue
which
has
been
raised
here
is
not
decided
in
favor
of
the
government.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
only
point
that
i
was
making
is,
i
do
not
think
that
you
can
fault
the
court
of
appeals
for
denying
leave
to
proceed,
that
is,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
they
erred
in
--
in
deciding
issues
which
were
presented
to
them
and
which
were
different
issues
from
those
presented
to
them.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
my
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
my
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
he
didn't
tell
them
that
he
wanted
to
be
heard
on
this
point
which
is
now
before
the
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
hope
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
did
not
make
any
suggestion
about
the
broader
position.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
--
the
issue
that
he
did
raise
was,
i
think,
frivolous,
that
is,
the
issue
he
did
raise
was
frivolous.
and
in
all
these
forma
pauperis
proceedings,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
been
assumed
that
counsel
had
raised
those
issues
after
he's
got
in
the
record
and
has
--
had
a
chance
to
go
over
it
which
he
thinks
should
be
presented
to
the
--
will
be
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
--
on
the
appeal.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
properly
rest
on
the
issues
which
counsel
raised.
now,
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
himself
in
his
pro
se
application
raised
five
points,
which
mr.
gressman
abandoned.
he
said
that
he
didn't
think
there
was
any
merit
to
it
and
he
raised
two
new
points.
and
so
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
could
properly
say
that
the
five
points
which
had
been
abandoned
meet
--
were
not
before
them
and
may
not
be
considered.
so,
similarly,
i
think
that
they
can
say
that
only
the
two
points
which
he
had
raised
were
before
him.
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
--
in
as
the
case
has
progressed
to
this
court
that
the
conviction
of
any
--
of
any
clerk
should
be
affirmed
if
without
a
decision
on
the
--
on
the
issue
as
--
as
to
judge
jack
--
at
the
--
or
should
i
say
as
to
the
--
the
broader
judge
jackson
issue.
i
stated
in
those
terms
because
as
the
court
will
see
from
our
brief,
one
of
our
arguments
is
that
judge
jackson
was
at
least
a
de
facto
judge
and
that
therefore,
in
this
case,
in
which
the
issue
with
--
of
judge
jackson's
participation
was
not
raised
at
all
on
the
trial,
was
not
properly
before
--
would
not
properly
before
--
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
any
--
in
any
instance.
because
it
is
our
position
and
this
is
regardless
of
what
maybe
thought
as
to
a
distinction
between
an
office
and
the
judges'
right
to
hold
the
office.
i
think
that
the
rule
is
--
is
clear
and
i
think
universal
state
and
federal
that
with
respect
to
this
issue
of
a
de
facto
judge,
it
should
be
raised
at
the
first
opportunity.
but
as
when
the
--
the
party
who
claims
that
the
judge
should
not
have
said,
has
an
opportunity
to
raise
that
he
should
raise
at
that
time
and
he
cannot
wait
and
try
the
case
before
the
judge,
and
then
on
appeal
say,
"oh,
he
had
no
right
say."
i
think
this
is
true
of
--
of
all
the
cases
which
--
which
i
have
been
able
to
see
and
it
was
true
particularly
of
the
american
and
foreign
case
which
the
court
had
last
year
with
respect
to
judge
medina
because
the
government
there,
at
the
first
opportunity
when
the
opinion
came
down
indicating
that
judge
medina
had
set
on
the
--
on
the
en
banc
hearing,
the
government
immediately
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing.
and
so,
on
that
basis
at
least,
we
would
say
that
the
petitioner
here
is
barred
by
the
principles
relating
to
de
facto
judges
from
challenging
the
authority
of
judge
jackson
to
sit
in
this
particular
case.
now,
that,
of
course,
would
not
solve
the
problem
for
the
future,
it
would
not
solve
the
problem
for
the
cases
in
which
judge
jackson
may
be
sitting
now
in
which
the
issue
may
be
raised
or
for
other
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
a
fair
comment,
mr.
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
--
we
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
we
attempt
to
deal
with
that,
but
i
will
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
we
differentiate
those
cases
from
this
one
on
the
fact
that
those
cases
deal
not
with
an
explicit
limitation
but
with
--
with
the
existence
of
the
office
itself.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
here,
the
office
of
district
judge
of
the
district
of
columbia
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
but
i
would
say
this,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
even
as
to
that
type
of
case,
i
think,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
where
it
was
considered
and
passed
upon
favorably
to
the
challenger
to
the
judge
if
he
hadn't
raised
the
first
opportunity
even
in
though
in
that
type
of
case.
so,
i
think
this
is
a
general
principle
and
of
course,
here,
this
issue
as
mr.
gressman
says
was
not
raised
before
the
trial
court,
and
the
trial
proceeded
to
its
conclusion
without
any
suggestion
that
judge
jackson
had
no
right
to
sit.
i'm
not
certain
as
to
--
in
the
way
the
argument
has
proceeded
whether
i
should
go
back
to
the
--
the
forma
pauperis
issue
but
there
--
there
--
are
one
of
two
things
that
i
would
like
to
say
about
that
because
it
is
the
general
practice
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
is
now
before
this
court,
and
i
--
and
i
would
like
to
present
some
things
which
i
think
have
a
bearing
on
--
on
their
choice
of
--
of
the
procedure
to
follow.
and
that
is,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
--
what
they
have
done
in
--
in
this
case
and
comparable
cases
and
which
there's
been
a
record
and
--
and
extensive
argument
and
i
--
extensive
briefs,
i
mean,
not
oral
argument
is
that
they
have
decided
that
the
issue
just
didn't
warrant
any
further
--
further
briefs
or
oral
argument
in
the
same
way
that
this
court
decides
when
it
--
when
it
make
--
when
an
appeal
comes
before
or
sometimes
even
when
a
petition
for
certiorari
that
it
will
grant
a
motion
to
affirm
summarily,
sometimes
reverse
summarily
without
any
further
briefs
or
argument.
and
we
think
that
the
--
that
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing
here.
it
was
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
--
i'm
not
referring
to
denial
to
certiorari,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i'm
referring
to
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
this
is
equivalent
to
a
--
to
a
decision
on
the
merits.
i
think
that
what
they
really
decided
was
that
the
--
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
at
all
merit
in
the
--
in
this
appeal
and
that
it
didn't
deserve
any
further
briefing
and
argument.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
that's
where
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
would
differ
from
you
and
your
statement,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
i
would
state,
and
i
would
state
it
in
a
little
different
way,
he
is
entitled
to
the
same
general
treatment
to
which
a
--
a
non-indigent
appellant
or
an
appellant
--
an
indigent
appellant
who's
been
granted
leave
by
the
trial
court
would
be
entitled
to.
and
our
position
is
that
they
would
not,
in
these
circumstances,
be
entitled,
if
the
court
didn't
wish
to
give
it
to
them
to
a
full
--
full-dress
oral
argument,
that
is,
if
it
came
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
proper
fashion,
the
court
of
appeals
could
summarily
affirm
those
cases
or
dismiss
them.
now,
unlike
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it's
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
there
isn't
any
mechanism.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
there
is
a
mechanism
under
1915
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
they
didn't
--
the
court
didn't
hold
that
it
shouldn't
be
a
separate
mechanism.
i
think
they
held
there
shouldn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
be
a
different
standard.
and
--
and
i
think
--
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
the
standard
is
the
same,
the
mechanism
is
--
is
different.
and
the
mechanism
which
--
which
exists
for
pauper
--
forma
pauperis
cases
can
occur
in
other
cases.
in
fact,
there
is
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
which
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
the
practice
of
sixth
circuit
is
certainly
a
reasonable
one.
and
--
and
perhaps
it's
a
--
it's
a
practice
which
should
be
followed
by
other
circuits
in
some
of
the
situations.
but
i
do
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
problem
before
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
a
different
problem
because
of
the
--
the
magnitude
of
their
criminal
appeals
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
there
is
a
mechanism
but
it's
not
used
very
often.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that
is
my
point,
mr.
justice,
that
there
is
a
mechanism.
in
fact,
i
--
i
want
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
doesn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
get
to
know
about
them.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
doesn't
get
to
know
about
them
because
it
doesn't
have
any
practice
like
this
court's
conference
before
certiorari.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
that's
what
it
did,
and
i
should
point
out
that
this
was
done
by
a
three-judge
court.
i
should
have
said
that
because
in
some
circuits,
there
is
a
procedure
by
which
a
single
judge
does
it,
and
we
think
it's
very
different
where
it's
done
by
a
single
judge
who
was
after
all
not
--
not
competent
to
--
to
pass
on
the
merits.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
doesn't
--
very
frequently,
almost
every
monday.
if
i
could
close,
mr.
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
the
problem
is
within
their
discretion
to
determine.
and
if
--
if
their
discretion
was
fairly
and
reasonably
exercised
in
setting
up
this
mechanism,
and
if
--
if
the
--
the
panels
of
the
judges
feel
that
in
a
particular
case,
they
have
given
a
full
and
fair
review
on
the
basis
of
the
record
and
the
issues
presented
to
them,
we
don't
think
that
the
court
should
--
this
court
should
require
them
to
go
beyond
that.
if
--
if
this
is
--
if
this
is
a
fair
procedure
in
--
in
the
massive
cases
and
is
of
one
which
is
appropriate
to
the
situation
in
which
they
face
themselves.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
they
have
no
authority
to
--
under
--
under
the
law.
they
--
they
cannot
do
otherwise
under
the
law,
so
that
it
--
it
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
this
--
1915
says
--
says
that
where
the
district
judge
has
granted
an
appeal,
he
shall
proceed
it
and
the
situation
is
different
where
the
district
judge
has
refused
the
--
to
grant
leave
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
is
--
has
asked
in
petition
to
do
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
remaining
to
me,
i
should
like,
if
i
may,
to
make
a
few
more
comments
on
the
threshold
in
forma
pauperis
question
and
then
to
pass
on
to
the
merits
of
the
questions
involved
in
judge
jackson
sitting
at
the
trial
of
this
case.
what
i
would
like
to
say
on
the
issue
of
in
forma
pauperis
appeals,
i
mentioned
yesterday
and
that
is
in
on
our
view,
the
standard
of
review
given
in
these
cases
is
no
different
from
that
to
which
a
paid
appellant
or
an
indigent
who
has
been
granted
leave
by
the
trial
court
is
entitled.
the
only
difference
is
that
in
those
cases,
the
issue
on
the
merits
does
not
come
before
the
court
of
appeals
ordinarily
until
after
argument.
the
judges
don't
know
about
the
cases.
they
don't
have
the
kind
of
conferences
that
this
--
this
court
has,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
if
the
issue
did
happen
to
arise
at
a
preliminary
stage,
at
some
interlocutory
stage
that
comparable
action
would
not
be
taken.
now
we
have
in
a
case
cited
in
our
brief
for
another
point,
an
example
of
that
which
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court.
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
a
criminal
case,
it's
a
civil
case
but
it
bears
on
--
on
the
issue.
it's
the
boomhower
case,
220
f.2d
488.
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
about
five
years
ago.
there,
the
appellant,
the
issue
on
the
merits
was
very
similar
to
the
one
here.
judge
robert
wilkin
of
ohio,
after
he'd
retired
for
disability
had
sat
in
the
district
court
here
and
the
--
and
the
appellant
claimed
that
he
had
no
right
--
a
judge
retired
for
disability
had
no
right
to
sit
in
another
circuit
and
the
appeal
was
taken
on
that
ground.
well
the
appellant
apparently
did
not
file
a
full
record
and
the
appellee
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal,
not
on
the
merits,
but
on
the
ground
that
the
record
was
not
in
--
full
one
and
not
proper
for
the
consideration
of
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
dismiss
the
appeal
not
only
that
ground,
but
they
said,
we
go
on
to
the
issue
on
the
merits
and
since
we
find
nothing
of
merit
in
it,
we
will
dismiss
the
appeal
on
both
grounds,
on
the
ground
that
the
record
wasn't
properly
presented
to
us
or
a
full
record
and
also
on
the
merits.
and
i
present
that
as
an
instance
of
a
case
which
happens
to
have
come
before
court
of
appeals
at
an
interlocutory
stage
and
--
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
acted
on
the
merits
as
we
think
is
done
in
these
forma
pauperis
cases
here.
and
i'm
told,
though
i
cannot
cite
you
specific
instances
that
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
there
had
been
cases
in
which
an
injunctions
pendente
lite,
where
an
appellant
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
seek
an
injunction
pendente
lite
that
the
court
of
appeals,
a
three-judge
panel
court
of
appeals,
hearing
that
injunction
pendente
lite
has
said,
your
issue
on
the
merits
has
--
your
issue
has
no
merit
at
all.
we
will
dismiss
the
appeal
or
summarily
affirm
at
this
stage.
i'm
also
told
that
in
a
--
in
an
immigration
case,
again
i
don't
happen
to
remember
the
name,
that
the
second
circuit
in
the
deportation
matter
where
an
application
was
made
to
the
second
circuit
for
a
stay
of
deportation,
the
second
circuit
did
the
same
thing.
they
went
into
the
issue
of
the
merits.
they
said
there's
nothing
to
it.
we
will
summarily
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
therefore,
it
was
unnecessary
to
consider
the
issue
of
a
stay.
now,
i
--
i
mention
all
these
instances
in
order
to
indicate
that
the
--
that
the
difference
is
that
in
the
--
in
the
ordinary
case,
the
prepaid
appeal,
i'll
say,
the
issue
doesn't
come
before
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
until
after
argument
--
until
argument
of
the
merits.
but
if
it
should
happen
to
come,
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
entitled
to
and
apparently
would
do
the
same
thing
that's
done
here
and
at
this
point
i
want
to
specifically
to
deny
that
from
our
point
of
view,
a
statement
which
gressman
made
yesterday.
from
our
point
of
view,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
limited
in
relation
to
dismissing
an
appeal,
to
deciding
only
that
the
appellant
has
raised
issues
which
are
unreviewable.
we
don't
think
that's
true
at
all.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
either
dismiss
an
appeal
where
there's
no
absolutely
no
merit
to
it
or
it
can
summarily
affirm
and
if
it's
not
limited
to
so
called
nonreviewable
issues.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
what
i'm
saying
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
in
this
case
and
in
other
comparable
cases,
the
--
what
the
defendant
has
done
through
his
appointed
counsel
is
not
a
mere
initial
representation.
he
has
gone
as
far
as
he
really
could
and
that
the
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
say
that
we
are
satisfied
on
the
materials
that
have
been
presented
to
us
in
this
case,
which
is
a
simple
case
and
on
the
issues
which
have
been
presented
to
us
that
we
don't
need
anymore
argument
just
as
this
court
does
when
a
motion
to
affirm
is
filed
in
a
direct
and
sometimes
even
in
a
certiorari
case
where
it
affirms
or
reverses
without
further
argument.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
--
if
the
government
should
happen
to
make
a
motion,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
is
not
ordinarily
done.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
don't
know
except
in
an
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
have
no
knowledge.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
don't
know
of
any
case.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
these
are
unreported
matters.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
i
happen
to
have
it
in
our
brief
on
another
point
and
i
read
it
and
found
it,
(voice
overlap)
that's
the
way
i
found
it
mr.
chief
justice.
it
just
--
in
preparing
for
this
argument,
i
happen
to
read
it
on
the
judge
wilkin
point
and
i
saw
what
they
had
done
on
--
on
this
issue
and
that
--
that's
why
it
came
up.
well,
in
essence,
that
i
think
is
what
i
have
to
say
on
--
on
this
issue.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
haven't
seen
a
case
a
sixth
circuit
recently.
i
--
i
just
happen
to
look
through
the
last
volumes
of
f.2d
to
see
any
reported
case
from
the
other
circuits
and
--
and
i
found
them
from
the
eighth
and
the
ninth
and
the
second
and
there
is
a
case
pending
in
this
court
from
the
fifth,
which
i
happen
to
see
in
the
office
and
so
i
--
i
knew
about
that
as
well
as
the
district
of
columbia.
well
i
--
i
now
have
passed
--
well
what
--
and
what
i
have
to
say
on
this
point
by
saying
that
in
our
view,
section
1915
presents
a
standing
mechanism
for
bringing
the
matter
if
the
court
of
appeals
so
wills
and
the
circuits
have
so
willed,
bringing
it
before
the
court
at
an
interlocutory
stage.
but
that
in
essence,
it
is
no
different
from
the
situation
which
would
happen
if
other
appeals
were
--
came
before
the
court
at
the
interlocutory
stage.
i
now
pass
to
the
--
to
the
issues
relating
--
involving
judge
jackson's
participation
in
the
trial.
and
i
think,
i
should
make
it
clear
because
i
don't
think
i
did
yesterday
that
the
government
agrees
that
subs
--
subsumed
in
the
questions
presented
by
the
petitioner,
are
all
the
issues
on
the
merits
relating
to
judge
jackson.
we
do
not
think
that
he
--
that
the
petitioner
waived
those
issues
because
in
our
view,
he
limited
the
issue
that
he
presented
to
the
three-judge
court
below,
to
a
single
facet
and
didn't
raise
all
--
all
the
elements.
on
the
other
hand,
we
don't
think
we
that
we
have
waived
any
defense
such
as
we
may
have
it,
as
the
de
facto
defense.
so
we
think
that
if
this
court
wishes,
it
can
consider
the
issues
on
the
merit
and
there
is
precedent
for
this
in
the
pollard
case,
which
is
cited
at
the
very
end
of
our
brief
in
a
footnote
to
our
conclusion.
the
court
there
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
pass
on
the
issue
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
granted
--
improperly
denied
leave
in
forma
pauperis
because
on
--
they
went
on
to
the
merits
and
that
is
a
precedent
for
doing
so
here
and
the
bakelite
case
which
if
of
course,
the
very
important
in
the
whole
issue
on
the
merits
as
far
as
judge
jackson
is
concerned,
the
--
this
court
there
said,
we
won't
pass
on
the
issue
of
whether
we
have
power
to
issue
a
writ
of
prohibition
which
has
been
mooted
before
us.
it
said,
we
can't
do
it
because
we
decided
that
even
if
we
did
have
the
power,
we
wouldn't
issue
it.
and
--
and
judge
--
justice
(inaudible)
specifically
said
that
they
were
reserving
the
question
of
their
power.
so
there
is
precedent
for
the
court
for
doing
that.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
might
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
there,
i
doubt
that
mr.
justice,
but
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
it's
possible.
there
are
reasons
against
that
which
i
like
to
say
and
they
are
practical.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
the
court
has
not
followed
the
rule
automatically
and
rigidly,
in
a
situation
where
it
is
felt
that
is
was
important
to
resolve
a
question
or
in
order
to
avoid
pure
security
of
action,
because
there
are
other
cases
involving
judge
jackson.
even
if
this
case
should
happen
to
go
off
on
another
ground,
judge
jackson
has
been
sitting.
i
think,
i
said
for
two
years
yesterday,
i'm
wrong.
he's
been
sitting
for
four
years
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
four
have
been
held
up
by
the
--
by
the
--
four
criminal
cases.
i
think
they've
only
held
up
the
criminal
case
as
far
as
i
know.
and
there
are
of
course,
prior
cases,
judge
jackson
said
on
the
parke-davis
antitrust
case,
which
came
to
this
court.
he
sat
on
the
gypsum
case
which
came
to
this
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
silverman
case?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
yes.
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
know
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
that's
right.
i
mean
--
well,
i'm
just
indicating
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
stand
strongly
on
the
ground
by
the
de
facto
argument
i
made
yesterday,
that
if
you
don't
raise
it,
you're
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
otherwise,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right,
we
do
stand
on
that,
but
i
also
like
to
point
out
that
judge
madden
has
said
in
various
courts
of
appeals
throughout
the
country,
the
other
way
around,
i
understand
that
several
indisputably
article
iii
judges
have
been
sitting
on
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
district
judges
kirkpatrick
and
van
dusen
and
kraft
of
philadelphia,
judge
(inaudible)
here,
circuit
judge
burger
has
sat
on
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
recently.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it's
--
it's
the
other
way
around,
but
a
--
but
the
--
i
understand
that
judge
rich
in
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
has
sat
in
--
in
the
district
court
here,
in
the
district
of
columbia
too
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
i'm
--
i'm
just
--
i'm
making
--
i'm
--
i'm
giving
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
they
had
no
stopped
assigning
him.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
--
he
would
--
he's
been
assigned
cases
up
until
the
present
--
present
time
as
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
one
they
ago
or
two
days.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
other
judges,
mr.
justice?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
judge
rayo
has
sat
in
the
southern
district
of
florida,
judge
rayo
of
the
customs
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
of
any
other.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i've
understand
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
--
in
the
southern
district
of
florida.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
he's
not
retired,
but
he
has
been
assigned
and
has
sat
at
the
southern
district
of
florida.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it
is
possible
mr.
justice
black,
i
happen
to
get
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
is
unlikely.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
in
the
future,
it
will
be
rest
and
i
think
the
consignments
will
continue
at
least
there
is
--
it
is
likely
that
they
will
until
there's
definitive
adjudication
by
the
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
i
am
making
that
argument.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
i
would
welcome
it
and
i'm
not
pressing
upon
the
court
to
go
any
further.
i
am
presenting
all
the
information
so
the
court
can
take
it
into
account.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that's
--
that
raises
a
--
a
grave
question.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
[laughter]
and
in
--
in
fact
as
i
would
think
that
–
that
this
is
a
kind
of
question
which
should
be
resolved
by
the
court.
i
do
not
think
it
will
go
away.
i
--
i
think
it
should
be
resolved,
will
ultimately
have
to
be
resolved
by
the
court.
but
of
course,
one
has
–
the
-
the
advocate
has
to
leave
to
the
court
ultimately
the
question
of
whether
it
wishes
to
follow
what
maybe
considered
the
normal
rule
or
whether
because
all
the
circumstances,
it
wishes
to
make
an
exception
in
--
in
this
kind
of
case,
as
it
has
done
in
the
past.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
seventy
three,
i
don't
think
it's
a
moot
question
because
the
district
of
columbia
is
getting
none
under
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it
--
it's
conceivable.
it's
not
beyond
the
realm
of
possibility.
in
the
--
under
the
law
of
probability
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
it
is
unlikely.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
that
--
that
is
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
the
--
the
further
question
is.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
there
is
a
–
i
--
i
want
to
make
it
explicitly
clear
that
since
1922
by
a
statute,
congress
has
authorized
judges
of
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
sit
on
the
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
pursue
--
it
was
pursuant
to
that
direction
that
he
sat
prior
to
1958.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
our
position
mr.
justice
stewart
is
that
that
was
not
a
merely
prospective
declaration
establishing
the
court
on
a
new
basis.
our
position
is
and
this
is
borne
out
by
the
legislative
history,
we
think
that
what
--
what
congress
is
doing
then
is
making
it
explicit
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
think
that
not
that
implicitly
overruled
williams
because
williams
did
not
have
before
it,
the
explicit
congressional
declaration,
but
it
--
we
think
that
it
added
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
overruling
is
the
word
i
don't
like.
we
think
it
sets
is
aside.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
that's
what
we
think
the
--
the
whole
intention
of
congress
was
in
the
three
statutes
which
are
really
in
pari
materia.
the
statute
for
1953
which
declared
that
the
court
of
claims
was
established
as
a
constitutional
court,
the
statute
of
1956
which
declared
that
the
customs
court
was
established
a
constitutional
court,
an
article
iii
court
and
the
1958
statute
which
is
before
your
honors
now,
which
related
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
never
had
the
power
with
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
mr.
justice
clark.
he
had
that
with
the
customs
court
judges
in
the
days
when
one
was
called
the
board
of
general
appraisers.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
1930,
i
think.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
have
–
they
have
had
life
tenure.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
have
had
life
tenure
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
at
least
they
have
life
tenure
since,
i
think
1908,
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
subject
--
since
1908,
subject
to
removal
by
the
president
on
three
stated
causes,
malfeasance
in
office
and
so
forth.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
--
in
the
beginning.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
as
far
as
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
concerned,
since
the
court
was
created
in
1909,
the
judges
were
appointed
for
life
--
of
had
life
tenure
with
no
power
of
removal
in
the
president
at
all
and
we
think
that's
very
important
as
far
as
the
case
before
the
court
now,
is
concerned.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
but
we
think
it's
a
very
important
factor
if
the
–
if
the
tenure
had
been
four
years
as
it
was
in
the
territorial
courts,
we
think
that
that
would've
made
it
impossible
for
us
to
argue
with
congress
to
provide
that
they
–
to
were
constitutional
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
want
to
embrace
both.
we
think
that
it
--
it
affirmed
what
it
done
before
and
if
it
couldn't
have
done
that
or
if
didn't
do
that,
it
did
something
new
for
the
future.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
the
basis
of
the
williams
decision
is
that
congress
did
not
established
the
court
of
claims
and
the
bakelite
case,
the
court
of
customs
appeals
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that
--
that
we
–
that
is
certainly
a
tap.
we
think
that's
wholly
wrong.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
basis
of
the
bakelite
decision
and
the
williams
cases
is
wholly
wrong
and
we
have
at
length
set
out
on
our
--
our
brief
the
reasons
why
we
think
that.
and
we
think
it
is
--
that
what
congress
has
done
in
these
statutes
is
to
make
clear
its
view
that
that
basis
was
wrong
insofar
as
it
could
constitutionally
do
so
and
of
course,
mr.
shea
will
probably
argue
this
more
than
i
would
be
able
to.
i
don't
mean
to
disavow
the
argument
at
all,
that
if
congress
could
not
or
did
not
affirm
that
the
--
these
courts
have
been,
article
iii
courts
in
the
past,
that
they
didn't
mean
to
do
so
prospectively
for
the
future.
we
do
take
that
position
also.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
began
to
sit
in
–
in
the
district
court?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
in
this
case,
he
sat
after.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
but
the
case
here
was
considerably,
it
was
in
1960.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
judge
jackson
had
exactly
the
same
status
as
the
active
judges
and
-
and
that
if
the
active
judges
were
made
article
iii
judges
in
1958,
so
was
he
and
on
–
on
the
--
the
narrow
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that's
right,
that's
right.
these
are
all
judges
of
the
court
and
because
i
have
only
a
few
minutes
left,
i
--
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
--
to
concentrate
on
a
particular
point
which
doesn't
go
to
the
whole
status
of
all
these
courts
as
well
as
they're
legislative
or
article
iii.
i'd
like
to
say
just
for
the
moment
that
whatever
else
congress
may
have
done
in
1953,
1956
and
1958,
we
think
that
it
made
these
judges
article
iii
judges,
because
they
all
had
life
tenure
before,
the
judges
of
the
court
of
claims,
of
the
customs
court
and
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals.
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
court
of
claims
since
the
beginning
of
the
constitution
of
those
–
of
those
courts
had
life
tenure.
so
what
was
the
difference
between
those
judges
and
the
article
iii
judges
sitting
in
the
circuit
and
district
court?
only
that
congress
could
if
these
courts
--
the
courts
we're
dealing
with
here
were
not
constitutional
courts
before
that
congress
could
reduce
their
compensation
as
this
court
held
in
williams
case
or
could
limit
their
tenure.
it
could
cut
down
their
tenure
and
what
we
think
that
these
statutes
of
1953,
1956
and
1958
did
is
irrevocably
give
up
a
part
of
congress,
the
right
to
reduce
the
tenure
or
limit
or
reduce
the
compensation
of
these
judges,
thus
making
them
full
article
iii
judges
whatever
you
may
want
it,
whatever
characterization
you
may
want
to
give
to
the
court
on
which
they
were
sitting.
they
--
these
judges
were
made
article
iii
judges.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
i
think
it
also
gives
them
power
to
appoint
judges
and
i
think
congress
could
appoint
a
--
a
core
of
judges
to
be
assigned
to
different
courts.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
i
think
--
i
think
this
court
held
in
the
duval
case
that
a
single
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
an
inferior
tribunal
under
the
constitution.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
that's
right,
but
we
think
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
because
they
would
not
have
had
life
tenure
before,
they
would
be
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
would
be
a
grave
question
whether
they
could
do
that
without
interfering
with
the
president's
appointment
prerogative.
but
the
president
who
appointed
judge
jackson
and
the
other
judges
of
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
appointed
them
for
life.
in
fact,
in
judge
jackson's
case,
he
was
appointed
with
knowledge
that
he
would
--
he
could
sit
on
the
district
of
columbia
because
that's
been
on
the
books
since
1922.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
they
have
had
life
tenure
since
all
the
current
judges
have
been
appointed
for
life.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
no,
they
had
--
they
have
had
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
they
have
had
it
since
at
least
1930.
the
customs
court
has
been
appointed
for
life
maybe
before.
at
least
since
1930,
they've
been
appointed
for
life
without
any
power
in
the
president
to
remove
them.
it
may
have
been
1926,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
the
–
the
commerce
court
was
a
constitutional
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
without
question.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
was
and
–
and
judge
mack
and
it
think
of
the
other
judges
sat
for
many
years
thereafter.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right
and
they
were
retained
and
assigned
to
other
–
other
courts
and
we
think
that
would
be
true
in
this
case.
if
--
if
congress
should
have
to
abolish
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
tomorrow,
that
these
judges
having
been
created
article
iii
judges
just
like
the
commerce
court,
would
have
to
be
assigned
to
the
other
courts
throughout
the
country.
