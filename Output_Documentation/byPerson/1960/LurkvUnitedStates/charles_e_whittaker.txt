justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gressman,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
district
judge
made
the
1915
certificate
that
the
appeal
was
not
taken
in
good
faith?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
did.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gressman
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
aren't
we
getting
pretty
far
field
or
what
--
whether
it
would
be
economical
of
time
and
effort,
congress
could
deal
with
this
matter
as
it
wish
than
it
has
dealt
on
it,
hasn't
it,
in
section
1915?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no,
it's
more
than
in
accuse
that
it
said
plainly
in1915,
hasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
i
thought
they
have
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
complaining
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
didn't
use
the
word
frivolous?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
they
show
in
response
to
(inaudible)
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
position,
i'm
speaking
about
this
point
one,
is
totally
devoid
merit,
then
haven't
they
shown
whether
they
used
the
word
not
that
it's
frivolous?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
suppose
that
this
event
in
the
course
of
this
trial
expressly
invited
at
this
identification
of
which
he
revealed
but
he
had
spent
a
year
in
the
workouts
with
the
prosecuting
witness,
but
he
didn't
fight
it
back,
dispute
affirmative
on
the
face
of
that.
he
couldn't
complain
then
as
a
matter
of
law
about
what
he
had
invited.
and
wouldn't
then
the
court
of
appeals
say
justly,
soundly,
your
complaint
is
frivolous.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
for
myself
alone,
i
will
await
your
discussion
on
the
second
point.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
gressman.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
been
suggested
here
that
perhaps
some
different
consequence
results
depending
upon
whether
the
judge
retired
at
a
particular
time,
how
could
that
affect
it?
he
--
even
though
he
retires,
he
is
still
a
judge,
isn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
judge
of
the
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
because
he
never
left
the
court
under
the
federal
system.
now,
he
becomes
a
senior
judge
thus
being
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
a
matter
of
known
legislature.
he
just
does
not
have
to
work
as
hard
unless
he
wants
to.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
think
the
bakelite
case
is
relevant
to
the
issue
here?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it
pertained
to
a
conscious
appointment
for
a
limited
period
of
four
years
in
the
territory.
and
if
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wouldn't
that
the
bakelite
case?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
now,
if
the
william's
case,
one
of
them
did
relate
to
an
appointment
for
four
years.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
which
was
the
case
from
which
these
other
two
have
stemmed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
it
true
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
as
much
as
all
federal
courts,
say,
this
one,
are
created
by
a
congressional
act,
just
what
do
you
mean
by
the
phrase
legislative
as
distinguished
from
a
constitutional
court
in
the
federal
system?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
about
this
claim,
what
(inaudible)
on
the
court
of
claims
where
the
customs
and
patent
feels
like
those
who
are
district
judges
are
appointed
under
the
provision
of
article
iii
regardless
of
whether
article
iii
is
mentioned
or
not.
but
others
like
territorial
judges
first
is
appointed
in
the
tax
court
for
a
limited
period,
do
--
their
point
does
not
leave
terms
of
article
iii.
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
often
into
the
full
(inaudible)
