mr.
francis
m.
shea
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
on
behalf
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
appearing
as
amicus
curie.
the
interest
of
those
judges,
i
think,
is
quite
evident.
the
status,
unquestioned
status
of
the
court
of
claims
which
has
existed
for
60
years
as
an
article
iii
court
was
first
drawn
in
question
in
the
bakelite
case,
dealing
with
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
and
then
in
the
williams
case,
it
was
held
a
legislative
court.
the
court
relying
on
the
dictum
in
the
bakelite
case
and
saying
there
was
no
basis
for
differentiation
for
these
purposes
between
the
two
courts.
the
1953
legislation
relating
to
the
court
of
claims
and
the
1958
legislation
relating
to
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
are
identical.
now,
may
i
make
this
suggestion
to
your
honors
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
clearly
wise
policy
standing
behind
the
settled
view
of
this
court
that
you
should
not
reach
constitutionally
issues,
where
case
can
be
decided
on
narrower
grounds,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
policy
doesn't
exist
at
least
in
full
measure
in
the
case
which
is
here
before
you.
the
issue
which
is
squarely
presented,
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted,
raises
very
considerable
problems
with
him
in
the
administration
of
justice.
if
anybody
has
the
full
scope
of
experience
needed
to
settle
this
issue,
it
is
this
body
and
it
seems
to
me,
we're
in
a
narrow
of
sense.
the
validity
of
the
statute
relates
to
the
problem
of
the
proper
administration
of
justice,
so
there
is
reason
to
dispose
of
that
issue
and
not
to
avoid
it,
which
was
if
one
does
not
find
in
dealing
with
constitutional
issues
under
the
broad
grants
of
public.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
should
like
first
to
turn
to
this
point.
the
congress
in
1953
expressly
declared
that
the
court
claims
was
constituted
as
an
article
iii
court.
to
be
sure
of
legislative
history
indicates,
as
mr.
davis
suggests,
that
the
congress
had
carefully
examined
the
williams
case
and
the
legislative
history
behind
the
earlier
statutes
and
had
concluded
that
williams
was
wrong
and
it
intended
in
that
statute
to
declare
that
the
court
of
claims
had
at
least
since
the
repeal
of
the
appending
provision
noted
in
the
gordon
case
in
an
article
iii
court
but
further
that
they
were
mistaken
in
that
or
not,
as
held
by
this
court
in
postmaster
general
v.
early,
if
the
language
of
the
act
can
be
given
prospective
effect
and
clearly
it
seems
to
me
in
this
case
it
can
be
given
prospective
effect
then
it
will
be
given
prospective
effect.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
rather
clear
that
if
the
congress
today
constituted
a
court
and
invested
it
with
tucker
act
jurisdiction
and
declared
that
it
was
exercised
in
article
iii
power
in
so
doing,
that
that
would
be
a
valid
act.
in
my
view,
quite
clearly
it
would
be
investing
in
that
court,
article
iii
jurisdiction.
quite
clearly
it
seems
to
me,
tucker
act
jurisdiction
arises
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
i
have
to
think
of
also
that
it
involves
cases
to
which
the
united
states
is
a
party
as
that
phrase
was
used
in
the
constitution.
but
whether
that
be
true
or
not,
i
suppose
there
can
be
no
question
of
the
fact
that
congress
could
invest
tucker
act
jurisdiction
in
constitutional
courts
even
if
it
might
at
the
same
time,
elect
to
invest
it
in
legislative
courts.
indeed,
it
has
invested
in
the
district
courts
and
therefore,
if
it
is
within
the
congressional
elect
to
determine
which
power
they've
exercised,
article
i
or
article
iii
power,
where
they
expressly
declare
that
they
have
exercised
article
iii
power,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
should
be
an
end
of
it.
now,
if
they
could,
if
they
could
today
establish
such
a
court
and
invest
it
with
such
power
and
declare
finally,
it
was
article
iii
power,
with
utmost
respect
for
mr.
gressman's
view,
it
seems
to
me
that
to
suggest
that
you
have
to
disestablish
the
court
of
claims
and
then
reestablish
the
article
iii
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
argument
has
had
substance.
that
it
must
be
possible
to
do
this
in
a
single
act
and
equally,
i
--
i
must
say
i
find
little
substance
in
the
suggestion
that
there's
need
for
reappointment.
these
judges,
as
mr.
davis
has
pointed
out,
were
--
were
appointed
by
the
president,
bind
with
the
advise
and
the
consent
of
the
senate.
they
were
appointed
to
serve
during
good
behavior
and
congress
certainly
has
done
everything
it
could
to
relinquish
if
it
ever
had
any
right
to
reduce
their
compensation
to
their
--
during
their
term
of
office.
and
moreover,
may
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
president
and
the
senate
concurred
in
legislation
which
certainly
contemplated
that
the
existing
judges
would
continue
to
serve.
now,
it
seems
to
me
therefore
that
since
1953
certainly,
the
court
has
been
an
article
iii
court
and
the
judges
are
article
iii
judges,
but
i
think
that
the
congress'
right
while
i
share
mr.
douglas'
high
regard
for
members
of
the
court
set
on
the
williams
case,
i
think
they
were
plainly
wrong.
this
has
been
the
materials
for
judgment
and
this
i
think
had
been
set
out
in
great
detail
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
in
the
pope
case.
we
put
it
in
capsule
form
in
our
brief,
but
with
all
the
necessary
references.
i
invite
the
court,
as
mr.
davis
has
and
i
think
mr.
gressman
but
certainly
mr.
davis,
to
review
the
williams
case
and
may
i,
with
a
broad
rush,
note
the
basis
why
i
think
that
decision
was
wrong.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
your
honors
will
find
by
review
of
the
legislative
history
before
the
original
act
that
those
who
were
managing
the
bill,
both
in
it's
final
form
and
those
who
were
opposing
thought
that
the
option
of
the
election
was
between
either
creating
a
board
of
commissioners
or
creating
a
court
under
article
iii.
now
to
be
sure,
some
of
the
chase
pointed
out
to
--
laid
to
the
chief
justice
that
he
didn't
think
it
could
be
an
article
iii
court,
it
wasn't
to
be
final.
but
the
men
who
were
managing
the
legislation
thought
that
that
was
the
election
that
they
were
making
and
they
elected
to
make
it
a
court.
when
this
court
in
the
gordon
case,
noted
that
the
court
not
take
jurisdiction
because
the
court
of
claims
did
not
have
finality
of
judgment
because
of
the
intervention
of
the
secretary
of
treasury,
immediately
congress
repealed
the
offending
provision.
immediately
this
court
changed
its
rules,
so
as
to
provide
for
appeals
from
the
court
of
claims
and
the
court
that
did
that
as
you
will
find
from
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
taney
which
was
prepared
and
later
filed
in
the
case
with
the
approval
for
surviving
judges.
this
court
that
time
was
of
the
view
that
it
could
only
take
appellate
jurisdiction
from
article
iii
courts
and
so
it
must
be
assumed
that
they
did
believe
that
they
were
taking
jurisdiction
from
an
article
iii
court.
moreover,
within
six
years
of
the
gordon
opinion
and
kline,
the
whole
subject
was
reviewed
and
unmistakably,
this
court
stated
the
view
that
the
court
of
claims
was
an
article
iii
court
and
reiterated
this
view
over
a
period
of
60
years.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
note
that
in
1887,
congress
reenacted
the
basic
jurisdictional
statute
of
the
court
of
claims
and
i
assume,
reenacted
it
with
its
gloss
on
it
and
the
gloss
that
was
on
it
at
that
time,
was
the
view
of
this
court
that
it
contained
article
iii
jurisdiction
and
was
invested
in
an
article
iii
court
and
then
in
williams,
all
of
this
was
avoided.
the
court
did
not
deal
with
the
question
as
to
whether
it
was
an
article
iii
jurisdiction
that
the
court
of
claims
is
exercising,
because
they
were
dealing
with
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
it
dealt
with
the
–
with
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
they
were
exercising
jurisdiction
over
cases
in
which
the
united
states
was
a
party.
they
said
it
couldn't
have
been
contemplated
that
--
that
cases
involving
the
united
states
as
a
party
defendant
was
within
that
phrase
of
the
constitution,
because
it
was
well
understood
at
the
time
that
the
constitution
was
adopted
that
the
sovereign
could
not
sued,
he
had
sovereign
immunity.
and
--
and
it
was
understood,
but
it
was
equally
well
understood
and
that
it
existed
in
england
from
the
13th
century,
that
the
sovereign
waiver
of
immunity,
well
established
in
england
and
well
established
in
the
colonies.
and
if
i
may
point
out
to
you
your
honors,
dealing
with
cognate
problem,
marshall
and
madison
in
the
virginia
convention,
dealing
with
the
problem
of
suits
involving
a
state
said,
of
course
this
doesn't
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states,
but
it
provides
a
court
and
jurisdiction,
if
the
states
waive
that
immunity.
and
this
was
the
view
i
believe,
your
honors
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted
and
was
so
decided
in
this
court,
in
the
hitchcock
case.
it
seems
to
me,
i've
had
to
deal
with
this
obviously
only
in
the
suggestive
way,
but
i
think
your
honors
will
find
on
the
review
of
the
materials
that
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
men
of
great
stature
on
that
bench,
but
in
this
regard,
they
were
clearly
wrong.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
would
suppose
that
i
have
to
concede
that
there
are
some
differences
in
the
legislative
history,
but
basically
i
think
that
--
that
that
is
the
case.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
well,
i
--
i'm
not
certain
that
there
are
--
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
argument
made
by
mr.
davis
on
that
point
is
conclusive.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
i
--
i
just
must
say
your
honor,
i
don't
know
if
there
are
judges
of
the
court
of
claims
–
oh,
judge
letemer
that's
right.
i
suppose
there
is
a
–
a
retired
judge.
mr.
francis
m.
shea
yes,
but
i
suppose
he
was
on
the
--
mr.
francis
m.
shea
--
he
was
on
the
bench
that
(voice

mr.
francis
m.
shea
thank
you,
sir.
thank
you,
your
honor.
