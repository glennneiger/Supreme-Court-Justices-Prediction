petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
gressman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you
were
referring
to
a
judge
who
retired
before
he
became
--
it
became
a
congressional
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
constitutional
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
gressman,
do
you
know
--
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
a
territorial
judge
has
been
assigned
out
of
the
circuit
in
which
he
is
serving?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
like
--
like
the
--
like
the
hawaiian
court,
the
alaskan
court,
those
are
the
ones
you
are
speaking
off
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
acted.
but
do
you
know
if
you
--
if
they
were
ever
assigned
outside
of
the
circuit?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i've
been
wondering
that
because
i
have
request
to
do
that
at
my
time
here
and
never
would
assign
them
but
judge
diamond
--
chief
judge
diamond
called
for
it
to
assign
him
around
in
his
own
circuit.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
know
if
that
ever
happened
in
the
other
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
if
that
could
be
done,
we
could
have
almost
the
same
situation
we
have
--
we
have
here
now
with
--
our
alaskan
territorial
judges
and
our
--
and
our
hawaiian
territorial
judges
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
be
able
to
move
forth
assignment
to
sit
in
any
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
any
of
the
district
or
circuit
courts
of
the
country
wouldn't
be
very
much
the
same.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
--
but
they
have
been
made
--
they've
been
made
--
that's
been
made
in
constitutional
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
that's
whether
the
issues
are
brought
in
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
before
you
get
to
that,
in
figuring
out
the
amount
of
court
time
which
involved
there,
i
wonder
if
you
ascertain
how
many
of
those
cases
that
were
denied
as
being
frivolous
found
their
way
to
this
court
so
that
we
have
to
examine
the
record
that
--
and
have
to
determine
whether
in
fact
it
was
frivolous
and
whether
in
--
whether
we
opt
to
reverse
it
and
send
it
back
for
consideration
in
the
light
of
the
ellis
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
have
been
quite
a
few
of
those
that
--
that
really
take
some
time
in
this
court
when
we
have
to
go
over
the
whole
record.
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
mr.
davis,
suppose
to
more
of
cong
--
congress
would
establish
a
tax
court
as
a
constitutional
court,
as
some
people
suggest,
would
that
mean
that
everyone
of
the
judges
who
sat
on
the
tax
court
in
the
past
who
are
retired
before
this
comes
along
and
whose
terms
have
expired
is
eligible
to
sit
in
any
district
court
of
united
states?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
difference?
chief
justice
earl
warren
since
when?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
try
--
they
tried
cases
in
more
judicial
manner
than
many
of
the
cases
that
come
before
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
ignored
reflection
on
the
judges
of
the
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
there
are
so
many
of
their
proceedings
there
that
are
--
are
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
davis,
is
your
position
with
mr.
gressman
waived
the
right
to
raise
this
question
on
appeal
because
of
this
memorandum
that
he
filed
with
the
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
you
say
he
didn't
raise
it
in
there.
he
only
raised
one
fast
comment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
whether
a
retired
judge
could
later
become
a
constitutional
judge
by
reason
in
fact
of
his
court
was
so
made.
do
you
--
do
you
contend
the
way
mr.
gressman
presented
the
matter
to
the
court
waived
his
right
to
pursue
it
to
the
extent
that
he
now
pursues
it
in
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
think,
mr.
--
mr.
gressman,
they
asked
you
to
say
that
they
erred
in
deciding
against
him.
they
--
they
only
erred
in
saying
that
--
that
these
points
were
frivolous
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
he
wants
to
be
heard
on
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
situation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
i
understood
him,
this
first
memorandum
that
he
--
he
filed
was
only
for
the
purpose
of
indicating
whether
it
was
frivolous
and
it
was
in
rather
general
terms,
but
--
but
that
if
he
had
been
granted
the
right
to
be
heard
on
the
subject,
he
would
have
briefed
it
fully
and
would
have
argued
it
fully.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
may
i
ask
you,
should
there
--
should
there
be
a
different
rule
in
the
district
of
columbia
just
because
they
have
no
more
cases
of
this
kind
because
by
the
same
reason
--
reasoning,
they
have
more
judges
to
take
care
of
that
may
have
in
other
--
other
districts.
it
isn't
as
though
we
had
the
same
number
of
judges
in
--
in
this
--
this
circuit
as
they
have
in
others
and
therefore,
they'd
have
to
cut
corners
in
order
to
get
their
work
done.
the
congress
takes
that
into
consideration.
and
they've
got
more
judges
to
do
their
work
with
because
they
do
have
this
jurisdiction,
and
shouldn't
they
give
--
give
these
people
the
same
consideration
that
they
give
in
--
in
other
circuits?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you've
told
us
a
little
while
ago
that
--
that
where
the
district
judge
grants
it,
why,
they
--
they
don't
question
it
at
all.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
they
can't
do
otherwise
under
the
law
(inaudible).
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
versus
united
states,
mr.
davis
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
davis,
how
can
you
say
it's
the
same
when
they're
in
the
--
the
court's
in
a
better
position
to
dismiss
and
appeal
that
is
taken
in
the
ordinary
way
after
the
briefs
are
filed,
but
before
argument
on
the
ground
that
is
frivolous
and
--
and
presents
no
real
issue
than
it
is
when
--
when
the
defendants
through
appointed
counsel
in
this
way,
makes
his
initial
representation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
can
the
--
can
the
court
do
that
in
a
--
in
the
case
where
there
is
paid
counsel
to
dismiss
it
on
the
briefs
before
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
heard
of
it
being
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
ever
been
done
to
your
knowledge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
you're
--
you--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
know
then?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
you
would
know
if
had
been
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
look
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
found,
you
look
pretty
hard
to
find
that
civil
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
judge
rayo
is
on
the
court
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
--
i
mean
he
is
sitting
on
the
–
on
the
customs
court
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
you
think
if
--
if
we
should
merely
hold
that
he's
a
de
facto
judge,
then
assignments
should
continue
of
de
facto
judges?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
certainly
does
to
me.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
how
would
the
--
how
would
the
interstate
commerce
commission
situation
that
justice
black
spoke
about
differ
from
the
customs
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
they
--
at
the
time
that
they
made
it
a
constitutional
court,
they
were
termed
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
the
court
of
appeals
now.
i'm
talking
about
the
customs
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shea?
chief
justice
earl
warren
of
course,
complete
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
shea
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
do
you
consider
that
the
status
of
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
customs
and
patents
is
in
all
respect,
identical
with
the
status
of
the
court
of
claims,
is
that
what
you
are
arguing
to
us
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
you
interested
on
behalf
of
the
court
of
claims,
in
the
first
phase
of
mr.
gressman's
argument
concerning
a
retired
judge,
a
man
who
is
retired
before
the
–
the
court
became
a
constitutional
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
court
of
claims'
interest
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
on
the
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
sure,
thank
you
mr.
shea.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gressman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that?
