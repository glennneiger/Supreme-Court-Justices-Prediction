justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
volume
--
what
is
the
volume
of
such
appeals
in
this
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
what
--
give
me
please,
would
you
mind?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
any
of
them
come
up
on
appeals
from
the
refusal
of
the
certificate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
provided
figures,
that
is,
in
comparison
between
the
volume
of
business
in
the
district
and
other
circuits?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
be
surprised
if
that
weren't
so.
is
it
not
relevant
to
the
difference
in
procedures?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
the
course
of
it,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
probably
the
course
of
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
see
about
saving
time,
how
much
time
is
there
for
argument,
oral
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
much
time
is
there
for
oral
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
the
case
is
taking
on
appeal
automatically,
an
oral
argument
is
heard,
how
much
time
is
involved
in
hearing
oral
argument?
let's
hear
about
the
saving
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
an
hour.
justice
felix
frankfurter
43
--
at
43
hours.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
court's
time.
that
isn't
the
court
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
court's
time
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
pressure
on
the
court,
the
burden
of
oral
argument
on
the
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
in
addition
to
the
time
taking
on
oral
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
reaching
a
conclusion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
simply
delving
into
the
fact
to
show
that
appellate
procedure
is
dependent
on
the
circumstances
before
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
--
does
it
hear
these
motions
orally?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
is
no
time
in
the
procedure,
in
the
current
procedure
you
sketch
it
of
the
district.
there
is
no
time
drawn
on
the
court's
time
for
hearing
unless
they
grant
the
--
unless
they
in
effect
overrule
what
the
district
court
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
if
you
compare
that
with
the
situations
through
out
the
country,
you've
got
a
very
different
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now
a
conclusion
that
--
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
found
on
it
but
you
can't
compare
unequals.
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
it
said
that
they
must
be
automatically.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court's
judges
did
forma
pauperis
to
what
is
privilege.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
it
could
be
court
of
appeals
if
they
chose
--
curtail
oral
arguments
in
an
appropriate
class
of
cases?
could
that
be
a
denial
of
due
process
or
equal
protection
considering
the
fact
that
most
state
courts
haven't
got
oral
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
cases
unfungible
goods,
questions
that
arise
in
cases
aren't
the
same.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
question
was
whether
they
could
make
a
new
classification
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
--
and
allow
oral
arguments
merely
by
lead
as
--
as
i
understand
most
state
courts
or
a
great
many
state
courts
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
ask
counsel
to
quit
after
they've
made
the
opening
statement
on
the
ground
that
the
court
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
to
where
you're
listening
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
bound
to
say
there
are
many
such
cases
in
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
it's
very
profitable
to
try
to
discuss
and
try
to
derive
at
a
--
at
a
formulation
of
what
is
frivolous
in
the
abstract?
do
you
think
that's
a
very
profitable
line
of
inquiry?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
--
i
must
remember
that
the
ellis
case,
the
ellis
case,
the
real
issue
was
whether
a
time
accomplished
should
constitute
themselves
in
effect
judges,
that
is
an
advocate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
misconceived
--
in
ellis,
they
misconceived
their
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
a
court
reading
on
the
--
reading
a
record
which
justice
whittaker
just
add
on
this,
outlined
delineated,
a
court
power
or
room
of
action
is
very
different
from
counsel
appointed
to
defend
a
person
and
conceiving
himself
to
be
a
lay
judge.
those
are
very
different
function.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
--
that
lawyers
can
talk
--
you
and
i
can
talk
by
the
hours
to
what
it
is
and
what
is
not
frivolous
in
the
abstract
and
yet
agree
on
specific
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
frivolous
isn't
--
it
doesn't
mean
frivolous,
as
we
lawyers
use
it,
isn't
--
what
frivolous
means
to
the
man
on
the
street.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
not
only
that.
i
suggest
further
that
if
a
case
comes
here
after
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
issue
is
frivolous,
we
are
not
to
determine
independently
what
we
think
about
it.
we
are
sitting
in
judgment
of
three
and
of
--
of
nine
men
or
five
men
out
of
nine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
there
is
a
clear
and
an
inevitable
difference
of
opinion
upon
equally
competent
lawyers
or
judges
rather,
what
is
frivolous,
we
--
we
seek
in
judgment
upon
their
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it's
really
arguable
that
when
--
when
parenthetically
remark
of
yours?
do
you
think
it's
really
a
non-frivolous
question
that
a
retired
judge
of
given
status
has
the
same
jurisdictional
power,
the
non-retired
judge
of
that
status?
do
you
think
that's
arguable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
divide
the
booth,
that's
arguable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
retired
judge
--
it
maybe
sure
you
stated
my
question
that
a
retired
judge,
that
a
judge
who
could
sit
in
a
--
in
any
case
is
--
is
disqualified
from
sitting
after
he
is
retired,
do
you
think
that's
arguable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
you
--
the
reason
i
asked
the
question
because
you
said
the
--
i
think
is
that
you
got
whether
at
least
no
retired
judge
had
been
assigned
when
that
carried
to
me
the
implication
that
you
thought
there
might
be
a
difference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
is
that
merely
a
fact
that
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
goes
significance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
different
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
tenure,
in
purposes,
in
--
in
the
inevitable
duration
of
the
court.
i
never
--
i'm
going
to
the
merits.
i'm
just
saying
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
from
--
from
canter
to
bakelite
was
an
awful
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
meant
you
to
say
mr.
justice
van
devanter
who
know
more
about
these
things
and
who
was
more
--
i
almost
said
crafty
and
is
not
just
about
those
things.
he
would
have
been
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
hold
that
an
act
of
congress
couldn't
make
the
court
of
custom
or
appeal
or
the
court
of
claims
or
constitutional
court.
however,
you
have
a
right
to
say
i'm
now
making
the
statement
dealing
with
merits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
carry
this
out.
you
said
certainly
this
second
question,
are
you
suggesting
we
should
decide
the
second
question
in
case
that
goes
against
it
that
goes
for
you
as
an
end
of
the
matter,
isn't
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
goes
for
you,
are
you
then
suggesting
we
should
send
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
that,
what
mr.
justice
whittaker
has
categorized,
as
a
frivolous
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
this
case
deserve
that
kind
of
elaborate
proliferation
of
judicial
proceedings?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
but
if
it
goes
against
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
you
suggest
that
--
that
we
should
send
the
--
the
evidentiary
question
part
which
mr.
justice
whittaker
has
expressed
not
only
his
own
views,
do
you
think
we
should
send
that
back
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
assume
that.
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
follow
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
say
is
the
--
is
the
conclusion
of
--
of
the
administration
of
justice
that
we
should
send
that
case
back
to
maintain
the
purity
of
the
procedure
you
conceive
it
rather
dispose
of
it
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
all
that.
but
i
want
--
want
to
know
what
you
suggest,
what
you
submit
to
the
court
as
the
appropriate
procedure
in
case
the
constitutional
question
goes
against
you.
should
we
then
say
we
decide
that
justice
jack
--
judge
jackson,
whatever
he
was,
there
was
jurisdiction
and
you
go
and
decide
this
other
question
because
it
wasn't
frivolous,
is
that
what
you
suggest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
should
this
court
clean
the
case
after
him?
if
i
may
repeat
my
phrase
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
as
of
a
proliferation
of
proceedings.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
then
it
comes
--
and
that
question
come
--
come
here
on
certiorari
again,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
that
could
be
blown
up
into
a
first
amendment
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
--
i
think
the
cases
that
came
here,
i
maybe
wrong,
i
well
be
wrong.
my
recollection
is
that
we
had
a
considerable
number
about
the
time
of
the
ellis
case
that
was
subject
to
the
ellis
infirmities
and
we
send
it
back
to
consider
in
light
of
ellis.
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
before
you
proceed,
(inaudible)
the
metaphysical
question,
they're
all
friends
of
mine.
i
should
like
to
put
this
to
you
--
i
should
like
to
ask
you
nearly
by
way
of
getting
elucidation.
on
the
assumption,
the
ninth
point
that's
made
that
granted
the
court
of
customs
and
patent
appeals
is
a
constitutional
court
now.
but
justice
jackson's
retirement
preceded
that
enactment.
therefore,
he
is
in
the
constitutional.
he
isn't
--
he
has
a
constitutional
status.
on
the
assumption
of
the
court
is,
that
would
mean
either
that
he
couldn't
as
a
retired
judge
sit
on
that
constitutional
court
now
or
he
could
sit
on
that
constitutional
court
but
not
another
constitutional
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
did
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
extending
their
present
tenure
for
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
all
events,
if
it
--
they
haven't
got
life
tenure
or
however
secured,
they're
out
by
the
very
terms
of
article
iii.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
article
iii
court
is
a
necessary
incident
is
life
tenure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
comes
whether
if
there
is
life
tenure
within
the
constitutional
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cox,
if
you
had
more
time,
you'd
have
to
clear
up
some
more
of
the
obscurity
of
this
subject
because
we
have
to
go
into
the
consideration
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
is
in
both
the
constitutional
and
the
legislative
court
because
this
court
held,
it
couldn't
review
in
keller
against
potomac.
it
couldn't
review
some
of
the
acts
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
they
were
legislative
so
that
we
have
in
this
very
court
of
appeals
jurisdiction
both
constitution
and
legislative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
held
that
in
the
o'donoghue
but
they
previously
held
that
this
court
couldn't
review
certain
action
with
reference
to
rate
fixing
because
they're
legislative.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
these
men
--
these
judges
were
on
the
first
year
law
students
but
they
were
dealing
with
ad
hoc
situations
about
which
much
we've
said.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
very
easy
to
obscure
the
difficulty
at
least
various
cases
and
when
you
say
the
cases
aren't
clear,
i
think
that
deserves
a
price
to
under
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cox,
on
the
de
facto
point,
i
haven't
--
mr.
davis
rather
[laughter],
mr.
davis,
i
have
merely
weighed
your
brief
and
not
read
it.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore,
i
don't
know
whether
you
deal
with
the
cases
where
there
are
cases
and
given
equal
justice
to
two
sides,
i
read
neither
on
the
brief.
there
are
cases
i
believe
where
he
carries
a
statutory
limitation
upon
the
power
of
a
judge
to
sit
or
a
court
to
have
jurisdiction
with
de
facto
principle
doesn't
apply,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
suppose
you
differentiate
this
case
from
the
fact
that
there
is
no
exquisite
limitation
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
no
such
office
and
therefore,
it
can't
be
occupied
even
de
facto.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
there
is
no
mechanism
as
to
non-indigent
as
to
regular
fee
paying
of
appellants,
there's
a
mechanism
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
--
the
argument
--
the
argument
that
would
be
irrelevant
in
(inaudible)
the
duty
of
the
court
of
appeals
sua
sponte
to
dismiss
frivolous
appeals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
myself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
--
i
look
at
page
34
ordered
by
the
court
for
petition
for
leave
to
prosecute
to
appeal
in
forma
pauperis
is
denied,
the
court
had
sat
upon
consideration
of
the
petition
for
leave
to
prosecute
having
duly
considered
mr.
gressman's
able
briefs
and
being
confident,
he
couldn't
say
more
than
he
said
in
those
memorandum.
we
now
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
that
it's
frivolous.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
court
dismisses
on
merits
appeals
that
asked
to
be
heard
on
--
by
plenary
jurisdiction
when
the
--
when
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
appeals
should
be
heard
on
plenary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
but
you
have
to
stand
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
have
to
stand
on
that
because
whether
raised
or
not,
a
judgment
non-jurisdictionally
entered,
is
a
piece
of
paper.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
view
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you're
not
making
an
argument
that
if
the
court
should
choose
to
say
all
these
sittings
were
valid
because
of
–
unassailable,
because
they
were
by
de
facto
judge.
that
would
take
care
of
the
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
i
say
you
--
you
couldn't
object
to
that
it
could
be?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
the
sum
of
it
is
that
as
to
the
past,
if
the
court
should
agree
with
the
government
that
these
sittings
are
unassailable
because
they
were
de
facto,
i'm
merely
repeating
now,
it
was
certain,
but
to
point
out
–
to
point
out
the
problem,
but
it
would
still
leave
open
if
nothing
is
said
about
the
substantive
issue
namely,
the
nature
of
these,
the
--
the
character,
the
potential
power
of
these
judges
or
for
the
judges
of
these
miscellaneous
courts,
i
said
only
characterize
them,
that
would
leave
open
the
problem
with
certainty
for
chief
justice
of
the
united
states
in
making
assignments
with
all
the
difficulties
that
it
involves
or
perhaps
that
this
is
a
moot
question,
if
we're
going
to
get
a
173
or
is
73
new
judges?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
–
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
one
--
does
that
mean
it
over
–
it
implicitly
overruled
williams?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
then
thought
in
courts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
right
–
i
would
put
it
--
you
quite
correctly
corrected
me,
but
it
nullified
williams?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
not
life
tenure?
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
when?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
the
board
of
general
appraisers,
didn't
have
life
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
since
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
i
thought
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
were
clearly
--
that
was
an
adjunct
of
the
treasury
department.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
board
of
general
appraisers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
thwart
your
getting
into
the
center
of
the
question
by
side
by
side
win,
but
that
wasn't
the
basis
of
the
williams
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
to
undermine
--
you
have
to
undermine
the
basis
of
the
williams
decision
–-
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
order
to
sustain
your
argument
that
the
1958
act,
wholly
apart
from
doing
something
new,
merely
affirmed
the
past?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
affirming
the
past,
it
certainly
was
going
plump
straight
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
williams
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
that
they
didn't,
but
it
couldn't
because
of
the
nature
of
the
nature
of
the
function
and
because
in
1789,
there
was
no
suability
against
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
you
have
too
difficult
adjunct.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
planning,
may
i
ask
(inaudible)
time,
are
you
planning
to
begin
with
–
with
the
–
what
i
think
is
the
-
what
shall
i
say,
the
stiffest
little
item
--
stiffest
little
or
the
highest
barrier
that
you
have
to
climb
over
namely,
even
granting
the
brief
--
that
the
court
of
customs
appeals
was
made
a
constitutional
court
in
1958,
judge
jackson
began
to
sit
before
his
court
was
a
constitutional
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
mean
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
he
--
he
sat
--
in
this
particular
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
still
a
narrower
stair
you
have
to
climb
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
there
are
cases
in
which
he
sat
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
hardly
suggesting
that
we
should
decide
this
little
case
and
then
leave
open
all
the
other
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
mr.
davis,
the
constitution
gives
congress
power
to
constitute
tribunals,
not
judges,
to
constitute
tribunals
inferior
to
the
supreme
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
is
that
in
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
a
judge
maybe
a
tribunal,
but
a
tribunal
isn't
a
judge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
--
all
of
them
were
retained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
--
did
i
not
see
that
judge
madden
is
speaking
of
retiring?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
why
is
it
meaningless
for
congress
to
say
we
create
a
tribunal
under
article
iii
of
the
constitution
rather
than
have
this
court
find
that
in
fact,
it
created
it
under
article
i
section
8.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
does
this
court
know
better
than
congress
under
which
power
it
was
–
which
power
it
was
exercising?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it's
mine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
can
congress
in
1958
transform
a
tribunal
of
one
kind
into
--
by
saying,
we
are
now
conserving
with
a
different
power,
in
giving
future
scope
and
authority
to
this
tribunal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
it
wanted
it
to
have
those
functions
and
it
would
have
those
functions
if
ab
initio
it
had
created
the
court
under
article
iii?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
all
–
all
this
--
all
that
means
is
that
congress
was
satisfied
in
1958
that
what
the
court
of
claims
was
doing
is
what
the
district
court
of
new
york
is
doing
when
it
had
the
tucker
act
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
everybody
was
doing,
it
was
doing
a
creative
thing
in
1958,
namely
saying,
from
today
on,
instead
of
establishing
a
brand
new
tribunal,
we
say
there
is
an
existence
of
tribunal
which
–
which
--
the
jurisdiction
of
which
is
the
business
of
which
is
to
be
very
concrete,
the
business
of
which
is
–
the
business
in
–
which
is
–
which
is
conducted
in
a
way,
the
finality
of
its
judgment
as
such
that
it
will
be
doing
it
all
over
again
today,
we
could
call
it
an
article
iii
court
and
so
we
call
that
court
an
article
iii
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
does
business
which
cannot
be
reviewed
by
this
court
because
it
is
not
judicial
adjudication
subject
to
review
by
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
deemed
a
constitutional
court
does
non-constitutional
business.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
conceivable,
it's
true.
that's
the
keller
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
for
those
are
just
words,
those
are
just
words.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
we're
reexamining
that,
that's
why
we're
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
they
do
that
with
reference
to
the
district
court
of
--
the
court
of
the
district?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why,
because
they
said
in
another
meaning
that
that's
the
constitutional
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
all
depends
on
what
an
opinion
says,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
are
here
to
re-examine
the
reason
of
these
cases.
