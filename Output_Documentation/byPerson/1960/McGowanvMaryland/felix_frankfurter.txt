you
mean
leaves
to
each
individual
the
decision
what
they
will
rest
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
that
human
means
capable
of
enforcing
such
a
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
short,
the
answer
--
your
answer
is
that
it
can't
be
enforced,
that
doesn't
mean
--
which
maybe
it's
certain
not
to
have
such
a
law
in
order
to
protect
an
overreaching
interest.
that's
your
argument.
that's
what
you
just
candor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
mean
that
because
merely
--
that
everybody
seek
what
they
will
if
you're
going
to
give
any
sanction,
isn't
that
true
when
they're
impossible
to
enforce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
remember,
they
get
laws
on
the
books
too,
aren't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
answer
to
that
doesn't
make
--
your
point
of
view
is
that's
immaterial
if
it's
difficult
to
enforce.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
that,
that's
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
case,
is
it
fair
to
put
--
say
that
your
case
could
(inaudible)
your
clients
are
entitled
to
complain
that
they
are
right
on
topic
because
of
embarrassment
they
come
to
people
who
have
religious
groups.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
relation
to
the
religious
issue
is
that
somebody
else
is
going
to
be
fired,
so
the
government
is
that
you
have
less
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
you
have
to
come
into
court
on
an
interest
that
the
interest
is
that
you
have
a
right
to
prophet
by
the
other
fellow
by
respect
for
somebody
else's
religious
group.
i
don't
see
--
there's
nothing
desirable
about
that.
