i
mean
is
it
considered
that
these
exceptions
apply
only
to
anne
arundel
county?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice

you
say
those
are
the
friends
--
those

settled
in
pennsylvania.
justice
potter
stewart
has
--
has
your
court
in
maryland
held
that
the
--
that
section
509
refers
not
to
--
not
to
items
which
happen
to
be
sold
at
the
beach
but
items
which
of
a
kind
that
are
sold
at
the
beach.
so
that
--
i
understood
there
was
some
--
there
was
some
argument
that
the
toy
submarine,
for
example,
might
--
might
not
have
been
a
violation
of
521
because
it's
the
kind
of
an
article
that
would
or
could
be
sold
at
the
beach
or
would
be
sold.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
is
to
this,
it
has
to
the
meaning
of
section
509.
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
mean
that
items
that
actually
are
sold
at
a
beach
are
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
521
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
other
laws
or
does
it
mean
that
items
of
a
kind
that
are
usually
sold
at
the
beach
are
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
521
wherever
in
fact
they
maybe
sold?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
holding
of
by
your
maryland
court?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
construction
of
the
statute
by
your
language.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
you've
answered
my
question
that
the
maryland
courts
have
not
construed
it.
justice
potter
stewart
not
to
me,
that
exemption
in
--
in
509
is
not
entirely
clear
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
whether
that
means
items
of
a
kind
that
are
normally
sold
at
the
beach
are
exempt
from
the
provisions
of
this
in
anne
arundel
county
exempt
wherever
they
sold
or
must
they
actually
be
and
in
fact
they're
sold
at
a
beach.
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
toy
submarine
might
be.
