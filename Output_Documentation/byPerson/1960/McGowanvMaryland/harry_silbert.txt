mr.
harry
silbert
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
justices.
i
would
like
to
correct
a
mistake
i
think
which
occurred
unintentionally.
mr.
burger
i
believe
stated
that
the
next
case
was
a
case
of
the
two
guys
from
harrison.
i
represent
seven
defendants
--
seven
appellants
who
sustained
a
criminal
conviction
in
anne
arundel
county,
state
of
maryland.
incidentally,
these
appellants
work
for
the
two
guys
from
harrison.
so
that
actually
i
think
he
had
reference
to
the
case
that
is
following
me
rather
than
this
particular
case.
my
clients
work
for
the
two
guys
from
harrison
which
is
a
large
retail
establishment
in
the
county
of
maryland.
within
the
confines
of
this
establishment
are
so
many,
many
things
as
has
been
testified
almost
everything
under
the
sun.on
a
sunday,
the
police
arrested
these
people
and
they
were
charged
with
selling,
two
of
them
were
convicted
of
--
convicted
for
selling
a
three-ring
loose-leaf
notebook,
four
of
them
were
convicted
for
selling
a
stapler
and
staplers,
one
was
convicted
of
selling
a
toy
submarine.
these
convictions
were
sustained
by
our
appellate
court
of
maryland.
i
think
--
we
claim
that
these
convictions
are
not
proper
and
that
in
light
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
should
not
be
sustained
and
should
be
overthrown
in
this
court
hearing.
in
order
to
more
clearly
familiarize
ourselves
with
the
sunday
blue
laws,
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
examine
the
sunday
blue
laws
as
they
apply
to
the
state
of
maryland.
the
first
law
was
enacted
in
1723
and
remains
substantially
in
its
same
form
today.
it's
known
as
article
--
section
492
of
article
27
which
is
the
criminal
article
affecting
the
criminal
laws
of
maryland.
it
is
entitled
the
"sabbath
breaking".
from
this
article
492
and
i
refer
to
our
jurisdictional
statement
which
outlines
the
section
492.
it
says
that
no
person
whatsoever
shall
work
or
do
any
bodily
labor
on
the
lord's
day,
commonly
called
sunday,
and
no
person
having
children
or
servants
shall
command,
or
wittingly
or
willingly
suffer
any
of
them
to
do
any
manner
of
work
or
labor
on
the
lord's
day
except
works
of
necessity
and
charity
always
accepted,
nor
shall
suffer
or
permit
any
children
or
servants
to
profane
the
lord's
day
by
gaming,
fishing,
fowling,
hunting
or
unlawfully
pastime
or
unlawful
pastime
or
recreation,
and
every
person
transgressing
this
section
and
being
hereof
convicted
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
shall
forfeit
$5,
to
be
applied
to
the
use
of
the
county.
thereafter,
a
series
of
exceptions
were
carved
up
to
this
general
blue
law.
section
521,
which
was
enacted
almost
the
same
time
as
this
section
and
sustained
a
number
of
exceptions
thereto,
permit
on
a
statewide
basis
the
sale
of
certain
food
commodity
such
as
soft
drinks,
candies,
confections,
milks
and
ice,
ice
cream
and
ices,
certain
tobaccos,
certain
motor
fuels
and
greases,
and
certain
periodicals
to
be
sold
on
sunday.
this
has
statewide
effect.section
522,
which
follows
the
one
just
read,
prevents
on
the
sabbath
day,
as
it
says,
commonly
called
sunday,
the
operations
of
any
dancing
saloon,
opera
house,
tenpin
alley,
barber
saloon,
or
bail
alley
--
ball
alley
within
the
--
within
the
state.
thereafter,
a
section
on
this
50
--
509
which
came
after
521
and
522
and
from
that
is
the
problem
that
we
are
facing
the
court
today.
the
state
of
maryland
contends
that
my
clients
were
convicted
under
the
general
section
of
521,
which
is
the
prohibition
of
the
sale
of
items
which
we
admit
are
not
included
within
the
exceptions
of
521.however,
509
is
a
section
which
applies
in
effect
only
to
anne
arundel
county
and
it
exempts
from
the
operation
of
sections
5
--
4
--
492,
521
and
522.
it
says,
"it
shall
be
lawful
to
operate
and
work
or
to
be
employed
in
the
occupations
of
operating
any
bathing
beach,
bathhouse,
amusement
park,
dancing
saloon,
the
selling
or
sales
of
any
novelties,
souvenirs,
cut
--
accessories
or
other
merchandise
essential
to
or
customarily
sold
or
incidental
to
the
operation
of
the
aforesaid
businesses
and
occupations
at
retail."
it
also
gives
them
the
right
to
rent
beach
chairs
and
beach
umbrellas
but
that
is
not
incidental
to
this
case.
so
from
this
overall
--
mr.
harry
silbert
i
believe
so,
509
is
only
applicable
by
the
title
to
anne
arundel
county.
it
says,
"beaches,
amusement
parks,
picnic
groves
in
anne
arundel
county."
the
code
of
maryland
specifically
says
this,
"will
only
apply
to
anne
arundel
county."
mr.
harry
silbert
now,
there
are
great
number
of
other
sections
following
492
and
521
and
522
accepting
numbers
of
activities
and
sales
of
merchandize
in
the
various
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
of
maryland,
also
applicable
to
boulder
city
where
we
have
a
great
multitude
of
exceptions.
but
509
carves
out
a
large
exception
and
says
that,
"you
can
sell
anything
which
would
customarily
be
sold
at
the
bathing
beach,
that
these
items
are
admitted
to
be
proper
--
offered
for
proper
sale
at
a
bathing
beach
is
born
out
by
the
trier
of
facts
judge
mickelson
when
he
tried
--
when
he
tried
this
case
in
the
nisi
prius
court,
he
said
--
the
court
said
to
counsel
trying
case,
"if
you
could
wave
a
magic
wand
and
make
all
these
places
were
the
alleged
violations
of
the
law
occurred
bathing
beaches
or
amusement
parks
why
you
wouldn't
have
much
difficulty,
will
you,
when
we
objected
to
the
fact
that
this
created
an
arbitrary
or
unreasonable
classification
of
the
law."
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
we,
our
clients,
suffer
pecuniary
loss
directly.
the
preceding
cases
have
be
labored
to
the
fact
didn't
or
did
they
--
did
--
did
they
or
did
they
not
suffer
pecuniary
loss.
here,
we
have
a
mercantile
establishment
operated
not
at
a
bathing
beach.selling
items
which
the
court
says
can
be
sold
at
a
bathing
beach.
now,
it
so
happens
that
the
two
guys
from
harrison's
retail
establishment
is
located
within
a
few
miles
of
the
bathing
beaches.
so
that,
a
man
on
his
way
to
a
bathing
beach
would
not
be
able
to
buy
a
stapler,
the
can
of
wax
or
the
toy
submarine,
yet
he
could
buy
that
very
item
at
a
bathing
beach
and
be
solely
within
his
legal
rights
as
the
law
lies
--
lays
him
down.
if
you
will
refer
to
judge
mickelson's
decision
in
finding
our
clients
guilty
for
the
purposes
of
bribery,
he
refers
to
the
distinction
as
being
ridiculous.
ridiculous
to
believe
that
you
can
buy
a
can
of
beer
or
buy
a
prohibited
item
and
yet,
buy
--
be
able
to
buy
an
accepted
item
and
yet
not
be
able
to
buy
a
shirt
or
shirt
or
as
he
characterized
it,
a
tailor
button
if
you
are
going
to
a
wedding
or
some
affair
on
sunday,
unless
you
actually
went
to
a
bathing
beach
to
buy
it.
now,
we
say
and
we
urge
that
the
court's
rule
is
to
be
arbitrary
and
unreasonable.
we
have
heard
that
there
are
number
of
cases
on
point
and
there
are
number
of
cases
which
distinguish
as
in
the
utah
case,
or
in
the
georgia
case
which
says,
"well,
you
can
buy"
it
would
be
--
it's
not
--
it
is
arbitrary
to
say
that
you
can
buy
a
bottle
of
beer
and
yet
not
buy
a
can
of
orange
juice.
but
this
is
a
different
case.
this
case
the
same
item,
the
very
item
that
you
can
buy
at
the
bathing
beach
may
not
be
sold
around
the
corner
if
it
doesn't
face
the
bathing
beach.
so
then,
if
in
any
respect,
this
law
can
be
classified
we
say
the
classification
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
subjected
to
judicial
review,
it
does
not
lie
within
the
province
of
a
legislature
even
though
it'd
be
subjected
as
the
harvard
law
review
irregular
review
sense,
that
it
is
subjected
to
the
private
interest
and
the
pressure
groups
to
cut
away
from
the
law
certain
items
which
can
be
sold.
this
is
the
very
same
item
that
has
a
denial
with
the
privilege
of
the
law
behind
it.
it
has
the
effect
of
a
law
to
say
to
one
group
of
merchants
you
cannot
sell
a
toy
submarine,
a
can
of
wax,
or
a
stapler
and
to
say
another
group
of
merchants
in
the
same
county.
not
only
the
same
state
but
the
same
county
you
can
sell
it.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
am
not
fully
acquainted
with
the
slaughter
house
cases
as
to
able
to
pass
an
intelligent
opinion.
i
do
feel
that
my
--
mr.
harry
silbert
well
there
are
monopolies.
i
think
i
can
comment
on
that
sir.
there
are
monopolies
which
are
created
by
law
or
are
authorized
by
law
and
have
their
place
in
our
society.
and
they
have
the
right
to
do
certain
things
that
possibly
others
don't
but
this
is
not
a
monopoly.
this
is
a
case
of
the
private
individual,
the
private
citizen.
it
would
mean
that
if
you
were
engaged
in
--
mr.
harry
silbert
there
are
a
number
--
there
are
a
number
of
beaches
picture
if
you
may,
atlantic
city,
picture
if
you
can
atlantic
city
as
a
beach.
if
we
had
that
same
beach
in
the
county
of
--
in
anne
arundel
county,
all
the
stores
on
facing
the
beach
could
sell
anything
they
wanted,
which
would
--
which
would
include
everything.
yet,
if
you
are
the
other
side
of
the
beach,
not
a
bathing
beach,
you
couldn't
sell
it.
now,
i'm
not
talking
about
any
other
item
except
that
which
is
sold
at
the
beach.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
believe
so.
because
this
is
not
a
monopoly,
it's
not
created
for
public
necessity.
monopoly
are
usually
--
usually
derive
their
origin
i
believe
in
some
necessity
which
benefits
the
public
but
these
don't.
now,
with
respect,
as
i
say,
i
leave
the
subject
to
the
arbitrary
classification
on
these
items
with
a
feeling
that
if
permitted,
it
would
give
to
those
private
pressure
groups
the
right
to
create
or
to
create
quasi
monopolies
by
saying,
"you
will
lose
out"
and
the
--
the
individual
who
operates
a
store
not
at
the
beach,
and
the
person
who
works
in
that
store
is
deprive
of
his
right
to
make
a
living
and
as
--
and
the
owners
deprive
his
--
deprive
of
his
right
to
sell
while
blessed
with
the
sanction
of
the
law
behind
them
the
same
mercantile
operation
in
the
bathing
beach
area
thrice.
this,
we
believe,
to
be
beyond
upheld
of
reasonable
classification.
it
becomes
arbitrary.
mr.
harry
silbert
mr.
justice
warren
--
chief
justice
warren,
i
--
i
would
--
i'd
subscribe
to
that.
i'd
subscribe
to
that
theory
except
that
this
is
a
classification
within
the
county
itself.
in
the
original
file
of
the
case
of
the
state
of
maryland
versus
my
clients,
the
states
attorney
mr.
devault
quoted
the
salsburg
case
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
which
had
behind
the
unlegal
--
unlawful
search
and
seizure,
bowers
act
we
termed
it.
and
he
said,
"if
the
act
applies
to
the
whole
state,
it's
a
validated."
in
this
case,
it
exempted
three
counties
from
the
operation
of
the
bowers
act.
however,
our
attorney
general
in
1959
--
in
1959
advised
the
governor
that
the
propose
passage
of
amendment
price
requirement,
that
is
the
--
the
imposing
upon
state
stores
in
five
counties
from
the
state
of
maryland,
the
right
to
impose
minimum
price
controls
on
liquor
would
be
unconstitutional.
it's
not
affecting
the
entire
state.
now,
this
is
the
same
attorney
general's
office
--
mr.
harry
silbert
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
harry
silbert
as
being
classification.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
correct.
we
say
we
go
one
step
further,
if
he
fires
up
people
of
their
property
and
their
right
to
make
a
living
without
due
process
of
law
--
of
law
and
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
united
states.
now,
with
respect
to
the
religious
aspect,
all
of
these
exceptions
and
the
two
original
general
laws
are
entitled
sabbath
breakers.
we
have
two
cases
in
maryland,
the
pierson
case
and
the
judefind
case.
i
think
in
the
judefind
case,
the
thought
brought
home
is
very
vivid.
they
attempt
to
define
the
sunday
law
as
being
a
day
of
rest
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
that.
and
the
court
in
its
--
in
its
decision
said
that
if
in
the
operation
of
this
one
day
of
rest,
the
majority
or
the
dominant
religion
is
benefited
by
thereto,
as
indeed
it
should
be,
then
that
would
be
a
good
law
if
it
encouraged
the
observance
by
the
dominant
group
in
maryland
of
their
religious
views.
now,
we
hold
we
have
no
ultimate
statutory
law.
the
people
that
i
represent
are
of
number
--
are
very
religious.
my
research
of
their
religious
face
--
faces
of
the
inhabitants
of
our
country
leads
me
to
believe
that
there
is
no
day
in
the
week
in
all
seven
that
could
be
said
to
be
without
religious
significance.
the
friends
for
example
hold
everyday
holly.
mr.
harry
silbert
all
the
--
everyday,
one
day
is
holly
as
the
other.
the
muhammad
--
mr.
harry
silbert
friends.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
think
so.
i
think
they
hold
every
--
they
construe
each
day
as
to
be
holly
as
election.
the
jew
on
saturdays,
the
christian
on
sunday,
the
seventh
day
adventist
on
saturday,
the
muhammad
on
friday
and
those
who
observe
the
buddhist
faith
as
has
been
explain
and
is
in
our
brief
depends
upon
the
place
the
moon
has
and
the
sky
for
the
particular
day
that's
observed,
so
that
it's
conceivable
they
may
have
seven
days
a
week.
i
believe
we
can
safely
say
that
the
legislature
has
a
right
to
designate
a
day
of
rest.
but
i
strongly
urge
as
they
cannot
of
the
expense
of
one's
religious
convictions
or
personal
liberty
designate
a
particular
day.
i
think
that
if
they
were
to
say,
a
day
must
be
observed,
it
would
be
within
the
confines
of
ones
own
beliefs,
to
take
advantage
of
the
day
that
would
not
do
damage
to
his
religious
beliefs
or
personal
liberty.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
exactly
correct
sir.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
--
i
think
it
could
be
enforce
to
some
degree
but
i
don't
think
that
the
difficulty
that
would
lie
in
the
enforcement
of
such
a
law
would
be
the
prime
consideration,
because
this
court
has
had
before
it
only
recently.
mr.
harry
silbert
no,
i
don't
mean
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
harry
silbert
no,
there
are
--
at
least
i
respectfully
differ
with
that
opinion.
i
believe
there
are
a
number
of
laws
on
the
books
that
are
very
difficult
to
enforce.
mr.
harry
silbert
they
--
that's
true.
but
there
are
a
great
number
of
the
--
of
laws
even
the
so-called
sunday
law
today
is
a
difficult
enforcement
problem.
but
i
do
believe
that
the
people
of
this
faith
land
basically
are
conscientious
law
observers
and
if
given
the
opportunity,
they
take
their
day
a
week.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
silbert
your
honor
has
put
in
exactly
the
words
that
i
would
like
to
use.
the
difficulty
of
the
enforcement
i
feel
should
not
be
the
prime
concern.
if
it
violates,
however,
the
religious
freedom
or
the
liberty
of
a
man,
i
think
that
is
a
--
that
is
a
paramount
concern.
and
i
respect
--
mr.
harry
silbert
no,
sir.
mr.
harry
silbert
in
all
probability,
my
clients
observe
sunday.
there
might
have
been
a
seventh
day
adventist,
i
don't
know,
who
might
have
been
observed
saturday.
but
on
--
mr.
harry
silbert
we
do.
we
preserve
that
in
our
original
trial
and
the
brief
and
before
this
court.
we
say
that
it
is
immaterial
whether
it
affects
upon
my
--
my
clients
personally.
we
say
that
the
book
of
the
law
is
unconstitutional
because
it
would
affect
anyone
who
would
be
forced
to
observe.
mr.
harry
silbert
we
wouldn't
have
necessity
inter
--
interfere
with
your
religious
freedom
sir.
mr.
harry
silbert
we
would
not
--
if
my
view
were
adopted,
it
would
not
have
necessity
interfere
with
your
religious
freedom.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
correct.
whether
the
law
--
mr.
harry
silbert
well
in
this
respect,
that
if
the
law
be
validate
or
in
them,
it
would
be
determined
by
this
court
as
to
whether
it
wouldn't
interfere
with
one's
religious
freedom.
in
other
words,
if
sunday
is
a
universal
or
common
day
under
the
valid
exercise
of
the
police
power
or
as
i
return
under
the
invalid
exercise
of
the
police
power
because
of
its
interference
with
one's
religious
belief,
i
think
this
court
ought
to
strike
it
down.
we
have
no
ultimate
law
in
maryland.
we
have
no
exception
for
sabbatarian
observe
--
observer.
we
have
no
exception
if
you
made
saturday,
even
if
the
court
of
appeals
make
saturday.
i
mean
rather
legislature
said
saturday
would
be
and
often
the
date,
what
would
happen
to
the
(inaudible)
on
friday
or
the
buddhist
or
one
who
would
observed
any
other
day?
i
feel
that
the
same
consideration
given
to
one
irrespective
of
numbers
must
be
given
to
all.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
think
i
--
mr.
harry
silbert
i
believe
that
would
be
his
right
sir.
i
believe
that
the
man
who
--
i
believe
we
have
a
right
under
the
police
power
to
say
that
no
man
shall
work
seven
days.
but
to
designate
a
common
of
rest
would
be
basing
on
one's
religious
rights.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
wouldn't
put
it
as
boldly.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
silbert
that
we
cannot
be
compelled
to
refrain
from
our
acts
because
it
would
of
necessity
and
appear
with
a
dominant
christian
religion
as
in
the
case
of
the
sunday
law.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
--
i
wouldn't
put
my
case
in
those
words,
sir.
i
put
my
case
in
these
words
that
our
approach
to
these
lawyers
that
we're
out
of
pocket
because
of
the
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
classification
of
the
laws
with
respect
to
the
sale
of
certain
merchandize
with
certain
members
of
the
retail
community
in
anne
arundel
county
can
engage
in
and
others
cannot
in
the
same
thing.
mr.
harry
silbert
no.
if
i'm
coming
back,
that's
the
first
on.
mr.
harry
silbert
right.
as
to
the
second,
we
avail
ourselves
of
the
privilege
of
asserting
the
invasion
upon
religious
rights
even
though
they
do
not
affect
my
clients.
mr.
harry
silbert
no,
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
didn't
mean
to
convey
the
impression
that
anything
was
dishonorable
with
reference
to
that.
mr.
harry
silbert
well,
according
to
--
according
to
our
law,
under
section
492
recreation
is
band
unless
specifically
exempted.
we
have
no
right
to
recreation.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
silbert
the
state
contends
that
521
is
involved,
521
of
article
27
which
is
on
page
25
of
our
jurisdictional
statement
in
the
second
part.
mr.
harry
silbert
these
people
were
arrested
on
a
sunday
for
selling
the
items
--
mr.
harry
silbert
went
to
know
--
went
to
the
magistrate's
court,
jury
trial
prayed
--
mr.
harry
silbert
the
charge
of
violating
--
violating
section
521
of
article
27.
mr.
harry
silbert
and
we
contend
that
521
of
article
27
must
be
read
in
conjunction
with
section
509
of
article
27.
mr.
harry
silbert
because
from
that
overall
statute
--
section
which
covers
the
entire
state,
509
--
509
applying
only
to
anne
arundel
county
was
carved
out.
in
other
words,
521
--
mr.
harry
silbert
well
521
says
--
mr.
harry
silbert
no.
it
--
it's
a
section
of
the
criminal
statutes
of
maryland.
it
says
article
27
section
521.
mr.
harry
silbert
our
objection
is
that
--
mr.
harry
silbert
as
this
521?
mr.
harry
silbert
that
even
there,
the
classification
of
selling
tobacco
is
for
example
on
sunday
is
compared
with
other
items
which
are
prohibited
would
be
unreasonable
in
arbitrary.
however,
509
--
mr.
harry
silbert
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
that
could
be
well
argued
sir.
i
think
that
could
be
well
argued.
i
don't
think
it
would
contribute
to
a
universal
day
of
rest
if
anything
adopting
the
argument
of
my
--
the
previous
counsel
that
the
acceptance
which
have
been
carved
out
of
the
overall
section
tend
to
make
it
not
a
day
of
rest
but
a
day
of
work.
and
that
521
cannot
be
read
alone
because
509
applies
only
to
the
country
we're
in,
and
521
statewide
which
must
give
way
to
509.
mr.
harry
silbert
that
sale
was
--
it's
loose-leaf
notebook,
staple
and
staplers,
and
a
toy
submarine,
for
which
the
defendants
were
found
$5
in
cost.
mr.
harry
silbert
well,
judge
--
judge
mickelson
who
tried
the
case
in
the
lower
court
said
that
all
of
the
items
in
his
opinion,
all
of
the
items,
a
loose-leaf
notebook,
the
can
of
wax,
the
stapler
and
the
toy
submarine
would
be
properly
sold
at
the
beach,
so
that
they
would
come
within
this
exception
if
they
were
sold
within
--
at
the
beach
in
the
county
of
--
in
anne
arundel
county.
mr.
harry
silbert
right.
mr.
harry
silbert
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
silbert
well
i
think
the
--
mr.
harry
silbert
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
a
judicial
review.
it
was
passed
somewhere
in
1951
and
--
1951
or
1941
rather.
i
don't
think
it's
been
brought
up
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
silbert
the
language
--
the
statute
language
of
the
statue
is
very
clear.
it
says
anything
sold
incidental
to
the
operation
or
customarily
sold
at
a
beach.
mr.
harry
silbert
i
haven't
had
any
case
on
the
construction
of
this.
thank
you
sir.
