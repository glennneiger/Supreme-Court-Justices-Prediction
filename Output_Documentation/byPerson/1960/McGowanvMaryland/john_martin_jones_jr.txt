mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
hoped
to
address
myself
primarily
to
the
arguments
--
constitutional
arguments
which
i
considered
to
have
been
raised
by
this
appeal.
however,
i
find
it
necessary
at
this
point
to
restate
the
law
of
maryland
and
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
say
first
of
all,
that
the
sunday
sales
law
with
which
we
are
dealing
which
is
section
521
of
article
27
of
the
maryland
code
has
its
origins
much
for
the
fact
that
my
brother
stated.
it's
not
1723.
it
goes
back
into
the
1600s.
that's
important
for
several
reasons.
the
first
sunday
sales
law
goes
back
to
1674
and
it
forbad
two
things.
it
forbad
the
sale
of
liquor
on
sunday
and
it
forbad
gambling
on
sunday.
now,
that
i
think
is
very
important
because
we
will
find
that
the
sunday
sales
laws
in
anne
arundel
county
today
permit
the
sale
of
beer,
wine
and
liquor.
they
permit
gambling
on
sunday.
they
permit
one
arm
bandits.
they
permit
the
so-called
slot
machines
of
other
descriptions.
they
permit
the
sale
of
tobacco,
cigars
and
cigarettes.
they
permit
dancing
saloons
which
is
a
quaint
phrase
that
still
used.
they
permit
various
types
of
recreation
of
all
sorts
which
i'll
take
up
in
a
moment.
now,
those
are
basic
sunday
laws
and
the
way
they
come
about
was
simply
this.
there
is
a
broad
base
sunday
law
in
effect
in
maryland
which
is
section
492.
now,
that
sunday
law
says,
"there
shall
be
no
work
or
labor."
it
does
use
the
term
"lord's
day"
in
that
section.
it
goes
back
to
the
language
of
the
ancient
colonial
days
for
that
matter.
but
that's
not
the
section
with
which
we
are
dealing.
that's
the
one
that
says,
"no
work
or
labor".
the
section
with
which
we
are
dealing
is
section
521
which
makes
no
reference
to
the
lord's
day.
it
merely
says
that
on
sunday,
certain
items
cannot
be
sold
and
it
exempts
from
the
items
or
rather
permits
certain
items
to
be
sold
which
are
the
basic
necessities,
the
type
of
thing
that
the
housewife
may
run
out
off
over
the
weekend
such
as
bread,
milk,
fruits
and
also
certain
items
for
recreational
purposes.
now,
section
509
is
a
specific
exception.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
section
509
is
a
specific
exception
applicable
in
anne
arundel
county.
there
are
other
sections
dealing
with
other
counties
and
under
the
home
rule
amendment,
certain
cities
have
the
right
by
ordinance
to
create
additional
exceptions.
509
exempts
from
the
general
statute
the
one
that
prohibit
sale
except
for
certain
items,
it
exempts
or
adds
to
those
items
which
maybe
sold
if
you
will
the
items
which
we
are
dealing
with
here,
namely,
souvenirs,
novelties,
and
accessories
essential
to
or
customarily
sold
at
beaches,
bathing
beaches,
dancing
saloons
and
that
type
of
thing.
other
laws
permit
the
sale
of
liquor
on
sunday
and
other
laws
still
permit
gambling
on
sunday
in
anne
arundel
county.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
and
that's
why
i
like
to
restate
the
facts
brief
--
briefly
and
adjust
myself
to
that
question.
you
asked
if
there
had
ever
been
any
judicial
construction.
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
recited
the
arguments
which
my
brother
is
making
here
today
and
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
necessary
to
determine
whether
it
apply
only
at
the
beach
or
whether
it
apply
generally.
the
state
took
the
position
and
it
apply
generally
i
might
say.
but
we
said
these
particular
items
are
not
items
sold
at
a
beach.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
well,
that
we
said
we
admitted
was
a
debatable
one
and
it's
a
question
of
fact.
is
it
or
is
it
not?
we
didn't
think
it
was
so
clear
the
judge
could
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
was
not.
we
thought
it
was
a
question
for
the
trier
of
fact,
the
trier
of
fact
found
against
it.
they
found
that
it
was
an
item
which
was
not
customarily
sold
at
a
bathing
beach.
but
when
we
come
to
a
can
of
simonize,
which
is
one
of
the
items
here,
we
come
to
a
stapler
and
staples
and
when
we
come
to
loose-leaf
binders,
we
say
that
those
items
are
not
items
customarily
sold
at
the
beach.
if
at
the
bottom
of
the
beach
it
would
have
been
illegal,
we
don't
say
that
you
can
buy
things
at
the
beach
that
you
can
buy
elsewhere.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
pardon
me,
sir.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
immediately
prior
to
the
luncheon
recess,
i
had
attempted
and
had
started
to
compare
the
sunday
sales
laws
of
the
colonial
period
--
period
of
maryland
with
those
in
existence
--
there's
an
existence
today.
quite
unlike
the
colonial
period
when
we
had
laws,
commanding,
the
attendance
of
church
laws,
prohibiting
liquor
being
sold
on
sunday,
laws
prohibiting
gambling
that
type
of
thing.
the
picture
of
sunday
in
anne
arundel
county
today
is
simply
this.
there
is
no
commercial
activity
except
those
relating
to
recreation.
you
can
keep
an
amusement
park
open,
a
beach
--
bathing
beach,
bath
house,
picnic
grove,
dancing
saloon,
bar,
tavern
that
sort
of
thing.
now,
like
it
or
not,
those
are
amusements
for
great
segment
to
the
people
--
of
the
people.
it
may
be
that
this
court
or
a
legislature
could
pick
more
wholesome
amusements
than
dancing
saloons
and
a
sale
of
liquor
and
gambling.
the
fact
is
that
they
do
exist
in
anne
arundel
county
on
sunday.
that
is
the
sunday
in
anne
arundel
county.
now,
that's
the
state
of
the
law
and
the
state
of
sunday
as
it
existed
on
september
28,
1958.
on
that
day,
seven
employees
of
a
large
discount
house
ran
by
a
corporation
known
as
two
guys
from
harrison
were
arrested,
for
the
sale
of
the
items
which
we
discussed
earlier
today,
namely,
the
three-ring,
loose-leaf
binder,
the
can
of
simonize,
staples
and
staplers
and
a
toy
submarine.
they
were
arrested
because
those
items
did
not
come
within
the
exceptions
set
forth
in
the
anne
arundel
county
statute.
now
--
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
that
is
in
521,
sir
and
in
509.509
merely
says
that
section
521
which
deals
with
sales
shall
not
apply
in
anne
arundel
county
to
the
extent
that
it
would
prohibit
sales
at
bathing
beaches
of
items
customarily
sold
at
bathing
beaches
and
novelties,
things
of
that
sort.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
pardon
me
sir?
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
492
is
involved
only
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
general
sunday
law
which
is
in
effect
in
anne
arundel
county.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
no,
sir.
they
were
not
charged
with
that.
to
answer
your
--
your
honor's
question,
you
asked
how
the
--
whether
it
was
by
indictment
or
information,
it
was
by
warrant
before
justice
of
the
peace
charged
in
the
violation
of
521.
that
is
the
--
the
setting
of
this
case.
now,
my
brother
says
that
this
constitutes
a
law
which
violates
the
first
amendment.
we
say
that
they
have
absolutely
no
standing
to
object
to
the
free
--
under
the
free
exercise
clause
of
that
amendment.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
any
of
the
defendants,
religious
practices
were
interfered.
in
fact,
the
record
doesn't
even
show
if
they
have
any
religion
or
what
it
is.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
that.
we
say
that
under
those
circumstances,
they
clearly
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
objection
that
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion
has
been,
in
any
manner,
hampered
by
the
statute.
now,
in
answer
to
justice
frankfurter's
question,
i
didn't
quite
understand
my
brother's
statement
as
to
what
his
standing
was.
we
had
taken
it
to
be
simply
this.
that
anybody,
be
he
an
atheist,
be
he
a
catholic
or
jew,
any
religion
or
no
religion
has
the
right
to
challenge
a
law
if
he
says
it
establishes
a
religion.
we
do
not
challenge
that.
we
think
you're
in
--
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
believe
that
any
citizen
has
if
there's
a
law
actually
establishing
a
religion.
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
you
have
a
law
that's
actually
establishing
a
religion,
we
feel
that
--
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
we
feel
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
the
legislature
--
mr.
john
m.
jones,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
i'm
assuming
you
were
prosecuted
under
that
law
your
honor.
see,
the
--
these
defendants
were,
this
is
a
criminal
prosecution
in
this
case.
the
other
cases
were
our
three-judge
court
to
enjoin.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
so,
we
feel
that
the
question
then
comes
down
in
this
case
under
the
first
amendment.
is
this
a
law
establishing
a
religion?
now,
putting
to
one
side
for
a
moment
the
argument
of
economic
coercion,
just
looking
at
the
statute
itself,
we
say
this
is
hardly
a
law
establishing
a
religion.
we
think
if
anything
it
encourages
activities
which
are
not
ordinarily
associated
with
the
--
the
christian
sunday
or
any
other
religious
observance.
so,
let's
turn
to
this
argument
that's
made
about
economic
coercion.
let's
examine
it
for
a
moment.
it's
been
stated
several
times.
in
essence,
it's
simply
this,
that
because
there
is
a
sunday
law
which
prohibits
retail
activities,
a
sabbatarian
who
by
his
religious
beliefs
is
prevented
from
operating
on
saturday
and
friday
afternoon
is
in
a
position
where
he
sells
four
and
a
half
days
a
week
whereas
the
non-sabbatarian
sells
six.
well,
that
in
essence,
as
i
understand
it
is
the
contention
that's
made.
and
they
say
that
this
amounts
to
the
establishment
of
a
religion
in
this
case.
and
our
position
is
--
is
a
simple
one
here.
and
it's
simply
this.
that
in
the
society
in
which
we
live,
there
must
be
an
accomodation
between
religion
and
the
civil
regulations,
that
always
happens
when
you
have
a
civil
society.
it's
not
common
to
this
case.
an
example
was
given
in
the
first
case
of
a
catholic
--
a
catholic
individual
who
has
children
that
he
sends
to
a
catholic
school.
now,
note
he
sends
them
to
a
catholic
school
by
his
voluntary
choice,
prompted
of
course,
by
the
articles
of
his
faith,
but
he
does
send
them
to
a
catholic
school.
that
being
the
case,
he
also
is
supporting
the
public
school
by
taxes
which
he
doesn't
use.
it
is
a
public
system,
a
law
establishing
a
religion
either
is
an
economic
burthen
place
on
this
catholic
that's
not
shared
by
other
members
in
society.
is
that
a
law
established
in
a
religion?
could
a
catholic
come
in
to
this
court
and
say,
"i
must
be
exempt
from
paying
taxes
under
the
general
school
system?"
and
then
let
us
take
the
case
of
a
man
whose
religion
prohibits
the
use
of
medicine.
could
he
come
in
here
and
say
that
i
cannot
be
taxed
for
public
health
services,
that
because
that
puts
me
under
a
burthen
by
doing
something,
by
paying
something
for
which
i
cannot
use
because
of
my
religion,
i
must
be
exempt
from
them?
is
that
the
type
of
thing
the
first
amendment
was
intended
to
prevent?
now,
we
respectfully
submit
that
it
was
not.
and
what
about
another
type
of
coercion?
what
about
the
selective
service
cases
this
court
decided?
take
a
situation
in
which
a
religion
because
of
the
tenets
of
that
faith
or
render
somebody
immune
from
the
draft
because
of
many
exemption
in
the
draft
statute.
naturally,
that's
coercion
if
you
wish
to
call
it
that.
people
who
had
no
religion
sometimes
we
came
very
religious
at
the
draft
board,
for
those
that
had
a
religion
that
did
not
prohibit
war
would
naturally
be
coerced
if
it
is
coercion
and
the
change
in
a
religion
if
they
feared
serving
their
country
and
possibly
dying
in
war.
it's
another
type
of
coercion
that
we
have.
and
what
about
aid
to
religion?
this
court
has
said
that
aid
to
religion
is
just
as
bad
as
an
interference
with
religion.
how
have
those
cases
fear
--
fair?
well
of
course,
we
have
the
fact
that
payments
to
a
catholic
hospital
are
not
illegal.
there's
nothing
that
violates
the
first
amendment
in
that
if
it's
for
general
purpose.
we
found
that
the
distribution
of
schoolbooks
to
all
students
including
those
attending
to
catholic
school
is
not
necessarily
bad.
now
that
case
actually
did
involve
the
first
amendment
religious
freedom.
it's
a
due
process
case
but
we
held
it
wasn't
bad
because
the
purpose
was
to
educate
children
not
to
help
the
religious
school.
and
what
about
the
reimbursements
to
the
parent
sending
children
to
catholic
schools
in
the
everson
case?
how
do
we
square
that?
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
comes
down
to
just
this.
that
when
you
have
a
direct
aid
to
religion
or
direct
interference,
well
that's
unconstitutional.
but
if
you
have
a
statute
that
has
a
secular
purpose,
substantial
secular
purpose,
the
mere
fact
that
there
might
be
an
incidental
burthen,
an
incidental
benefit
to
a
particular
religion
does
not
make
it
bad.
and
i
point
that
out
specifically
with
the
zorach
case.
there
was
a
reference
here
made
that
our
cases
go
beyond
that
on
a
contrary.
we
say
our
case
is
clearly
to
the
right
of
the
zorach
case
if
you
wish.
there,
there
was
no
secular
purpose.
in
the
zorach
case,
this
soul
purpose
about
law
was
to
accommodate
the
school
system
to
religious
activities.
now,
i
think
that
was
true
and
there
was
no
dispute
between
the
majority
and
the
minority
of
this
court
on
that
point.
there
was
no
secular
purpose
involved
in
accommodating
the
school
system.
this
court
thought
that
that
was
a
legitimate
object
and
upheld
that
statute.
now,
we
say
taking
the
zorach
case,
there,
of
course,
was
some
incidental
coercion
i
think
and
the
mere
fact
that
school
children
like
to
conform
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
brown
versus
board
of
education.
children
in
school
feel
when
they
have
treated
differently
from
others.
that
this
court
sustained
the
zorach
case
even
though
those
who
did
not
go
to
school
--
did
not
go
to
religious
classes,
were
forced
to
remain
in
school
during
the
so-called
release
time
period.
now,
we
say
that
if
you
compare
that
case
with
the
mccollum
case
which
was
stricken
down,
the
difference
we
think
is
this.
that
this
court
stated
in
the
zorach
case
in
mccollum,
there
was
an
actual
use
of
state
supported
school
property,
the
school
buildings
for
these
religious
activities.
now,
we
say
that
wasn't
just
the
case
of
real
estate
being
used
but
it
was
a
direct,
a
direct
participation
by
the
school
system
in
these
religious
practices.
that
we
think
is
the
difference
between
the
zorach
case
and
the
mccollum
case,
direct
participation
by
the
state.
now,
direct
participation,
direct
burthens
are
unconstitutional
but
we
respectfully
submit
that
when
there
is
a
valid
secular
purpose,
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
an
incidental
burthen
or
an
incidental
benefit
is
part
of
the
price
we
pay
for
having
a
lay
state
and
not
a
state
which
is
governed
by
religion
but
of
a
civil
regulation.
i
might
add
that
in
the
--
by
the
same
token
the
various
other
incidental
encouragements
which
we
have
by
laws
making
christmas
a
legal
holiday
by
this
court
itself
not
sitting
on
sundays
as
to
other
courts
by
the
very
oath
that
the
attorneys
of
this
bar
take,
by
the
very
try
that's
given
by
the
court
trier.god
save
this
honorable
court.
those
are
things
that
are
tolerated
if
you
wish
because
they
do
not
directly
forward
a
religion
or
directly
impede
one.
they're
incidental
to
our
culture.
now,
finally
i
would
like
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
this
is
an
attack
on
a
maryland
statute
itself.
keep
in
mind,
none
of
these
individuals
have
come
in
here
and
shown
any
economic
damage,
none
of
them
have
said
that
it
interferes
with
their
religion.
it
is
a
flat
attack
on
a
statute
--
on
its
face.
now,
if
this
court
should
decide,
which
i
respectfully
submit
it
should
not,
that
sabbatarians
must
necessarily
be
exempted
from
the
sunday
laws
or
that
sunday
laws
are
invalid
as
applied
to
sabbatarians.
the
convictions
in
this
case
must
still
stand
your
honors.
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
a
sabbatarian
objecting.
he's
objecting
to
the
face
of
the
statute.
and
i
think
the
answer
is
if
they're
invalid
as
to
sabbatarians,
it
does
not
affect
the
outcome
of
this
case.
now,
we
move
to
the
other
contentions
which
my
brother
made,
if
i
may.
he
says
that
these
laws
are
arbitrary
or
arbitrary
classifications.
in
making
that
argument,
he
assumes
the
point
an
issue.
on
a
one
hand,
he
--
it's
consistent
but
he
still
assumes
the
point
an
issue.
he
says,
"this
is
a
religious
day.
it's
perfectly
ridiculous
to
sell
beer
and
whiskey
and
not
sell
orange
juice.
it's
perfectly
ridiculous
to
permit
gambling
and
not
to
sale
a
blue
slip
binders."
well,
the
answer
is
that
this
is
a
not
a
religious
statute.
it's
a
civil
regulation
which
encourages,
if
you
will,
recreation.
the
recreation,
as
i
have
mentioned,
involved
in
drinking,
involved
in
frequent
in
tavern
is
there
for
people
who
enjoy
it,
and
it
is
a
religious
type
of
--
i
mean
a
--
it
is
a
--
an
--
a
recreational
type
of
thing.
i
don't
think
the
same
as
true
about
selling
cans
of
orange
juice
or
loose-leaf
binders.
if
we
examine
the
various
items
which
can
be
sold,
they
clearly
fall
into
those
two
categories.
those
which
go
to
necessities
such
as
bread
and
milk,
that
type
of
thing,
those
that
go
to
recreation
such
as
dancing
saloons,
bath
houses,
beaches,
taverns
and
things
of
that
nature,
and
slot
machines.
thank
your
honor,
and
pinball
machines.
i
think
that
is
the
difference
between
the
classification
test
that
we
have
here
and
the
one
that
my
brother
would
have
to
apply
which
has
no
application
because
it
is
not
a
religious
a
statute.
now,
insofar
as
there's
been
an
attempt
to
say
that
there
is
some
law
in
maryland
that
says
somebody
at
the
beach
can
sell
and
somebody
a
block
away
cannot
sell,
at
least
the
attorney
general's
office
knows
of
no
such
law.
this
law
has
been
enforced
in
maryland
in
this
manner
in
anne
arundel
county.
that
if
the
item
is
one
which
is
customarily
sold
at
a
beach
house,
a
bathing
beach
or
what
have
you
then
it
is
permitted.
these
people
were
not
arrested
because
of
the
fact
that
they
sold
something
that
could
be
sold
at
the
beach
other
than
at
the
beach.
that's
the
argument
that
they
made.
in
fact,
they
didn't
quite
make
that
argument.
they
said
that
the
toy
submarine
is
one
which
could
be
sold
at
the
beach
and
therefore,
we
should
be
allowed
to
sell
it
here.
the
state
didn't
argue
to
the
contrary.
the
state
argued
that
it
was
not
an
item
which
was
so
clearly
one
that
was
sold
at
the
beach
that
the
court
should
say
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
was
a
question
of
fact.
the
court
decided
against
it.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
upheld
that
and
specifically
said
in
their
opinion
that
they
did
not
have
to
decide
as
other
question
which
was
raised,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
sales
could
be
made
elsewhere
than
at
the
beach
itself.
and
i
call
your
honor's
attention
to
the
section
of
the
--
of
the
brief
where
that
passage
is
found.
it's
at
page
41
of
the
appellant's
jurisdictional
statement
which
is
a
statement
from
the
court
in
which
they
specifically
point
out
that
they
do
not
have
to
decide
that
point
since
it's
not
involved
in
this
case.
that
is
the
only
judicial
determination
or
interpretation
of
section
509
in
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question.
now,
what
is
the
other
reason
or
reasons
why
this
statute
it
says
--
it
said
to
be
unconstitutional?
well,
they
say
the
statute
is
vague.
they
said
that
there,
our
people
two
guys
from
harrison
who
sell,
as
my
brother
said
everything
under
the
sun,
would
not
know
what
he
--
what
they
could
sell
and
what
they
couldn't
sell
because
we
have
an
item
of
things
customarily
sold
at
bathing
beaches.
but,
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
a
valid
classification,
it's
not
vague.
the
person
of
ordinary
intelligence
can
tell
what's
customarily
sold
there
and
as
this
court
has
said
the
mere
fact
that
you
cannot
define
it
with
mathematical
precision
doesn't
render
it
bad
and
as
this
court
has
also
said
in
the
boyce
motor
lines
case,
"it's
not
unfair,"
and
this
is
"to
require
that
one
who
deliberately
goes
peerlessly
close
to
an
area
of
proscribe
conduct
shall
take
the
risk
that
he
may
cross
the
line."
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
when
a
discount
house
sells
all
these
items
that
they
--
it
behooves
them
to
come
in
and
say
that
they
were
misled
by
the
language
of
the
statute
which
relates
specifically
to
items
sold
at
bathing
beaches
an
incidental
thereto.
the
last
point
which
was
raised
by
my
brother
is
a
fact
that
these
exceptions
are
not
uniform
throughout
the
state.
well,
our
answer
to
that
is
two
fold.
number
one,
he
didn't
raise
it
below.
there's
no
contention
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
ground.
but
secondly,
and
of
equal
importance,
is
the
fact
that
this
court
has
already
decided
the
case,
a
maryland
case,
a
case
from
anne
arundel
county,
a
case
that
had
exceptions
peculiar
to
anne
arundel
county
and
has
upheld
it
and
that
dissolves
for
salsburg
case
in
346
u.s.
in
that
case,
we
have
what
it
--
is
known
in
maryland
as
a
bowers
act
which
prohibits
in
misdemeanor
prosecutions,
evidence
illegally
obtained,
obtained
in
violation
of
the
search
and
seizure
laws.
there
is
an
exception
from
that
statute
of
anne
arundel
county
in
gambling
prosecutions.
in
gambling
prosecutions
in
anne
arundel
county
such
evidence
is
admissible.
now,
it
came
to
this
court
on
the
grounds
that
that
was
illegal
because
it
was
not
statewide
in
application.
it
violated
also
its
principles
as
were
alleged
including
the
equal
protection
clause.
this
court
said
that
the
obligation
was
not
on
a
state
to
prove
the
reason
for
that
exemption
but
it
was
the
obligation
on
the
other
side
to
prove
the
lack
of
such
reason.
now
here,
we
come
up
with
a
record
that
is
totally
barren.
they
didn't
even
raise
the
point
below.
we
respectfully
submit
that
as
this
court
said,
the
mere
fact
that
use
county
lines
as
a
distinction
does
not
necessarily
make
it
bad,
the
burthen
is
on
the
party
attacking
it.
he
has
not
only
not
carried
that
burthen
in
this
case,
he
didn't
even
attempt
to
below.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
on
it.
so,
we
feel
that
there
can
hardly
be
any
contention
made
on
that
point.
in
summary,
we
submit
that
this
is
purely
a
case
of
a
civil
--
of
a
civil
regulation
which
has
been
enforced
in
maryland
for
many
years.
we
have
no
exception
for
the
jewish
faith.
we
have
no
exceptions
at
all,
except
for
taking
the
rights.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
law
does
not
violate
any
of
the
fundamental
freedoms
which
were
incorporated
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that
it
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment
or
any
decision
in
this
court.
thank
you.
