mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
in
this
case,
more
than
in
most,
the
formulation
of
the
question
affects
the
answer.
if
we
accept
mr.
dunau's
phraseology
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
mrs.
brawner's
employment
could
be
terminated
on
security
grounds
without
notice
or
hearing
or
a
chance
to
explain,
it's
difficult
to
distinguish
this
case
from
greene
against
mcelroy.
if
on
the
other
hand,
we
accept
the
formulation
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
below,
that
the
case
merely
involves
the
authority
of
military
commanders
to
determine
the
right
of
access
of
visitors
to
their
installations,
are
the
caused
of
transfer
of
persons
out
a
sensitive
area,
most
of
the
serious
problems
in
the
case
disappear.
but
actually,
the
facts
in
the
case
are
not
in
dispute
and
so
we
don't
really
advance
our
argument
too
much
by
adopting
one
phraseology
or
the
other.
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
keep
in
mind
precisely,
what
authority
the
authorities
were
tempting
--
the
officers
were
attempting
to
exercise
and
what
rights
of
the
petitioner
were
directly
and
indirectly
acted
upon
by
that
exercise
of
authority.
before
i
get
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
appropriate
to
say
a
word
about
the
nature
of
the
gun
factory
itself.
it
covers
a
large
area
or
about
125
acres
which
are
developed
--
which
are
devoted
to
the
development,
in
the
testing
and
the
actual
manufacture
of
naval
weapons.
historically,
all
of
the
large
cauwenbergh
cannons
for
war
vessels
were
manufactured
there.
this
has
given
away
in
the
present
time
to
--
largely
to
the
manufacture
and
development
of
guided
missile
launching
mechanisms,
which
are
incredibly
complicated,
mechanical
and
electronic
installations.
but
the
variety
of
work
done
in
the
gun
factory
goes
beyond
cannons
or
--
or
guided
missile
launching
systems,
with
here
for
example
that
the
--
the
norden
bomb
--
bombsight
was
developed
and
actually
manufactured
over
the
years.
at
the
time
mrs.
brawner
was
there
and
before
and
after,
there's
been
a
good
deal
of
work
with
nuclear
weapons
and
nuclear
work
done
in
the
gun
factory
grounds.
it
is
on
the
warps
of
the
--
at
the
gun
--
within
the
confines
of
the
--
of
the
weapons
plant
that
the
presidential
yachts
presently
burr.
and
in
an
area,
immediately
adjoining
the
area
where
mrs.
brawner
worked,
she
worked
in
what
was
called
the
bellevue
annex,
which
is
separated
slightly
geographically
from
the
rest
of
the
gun
factory.
right
immediately
adjacent
to
the
--
to
this
annex,
is
what
is
called
the
navy
experimental
laboratory
i
believe,
separated
only
by
a
gate
which
is
opened
at
the
time
when
employees
go
back
and
forth.
and
then
the
experimental
laboratory,
there
is,
for
example
at
the
present
time
nuclear
reactor
and
experimental
reactor,
which
is
in
operation.
i
--
i'd
say
this
because
i
think
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
i
don't
think
anyone
can
question
that
this
is
an
installation
where
the
public
interest
requires
careful
control
of
methods
of
access
in
order
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
united
states.
now,
since
mrs.
brawner
was
employed
in
a
cafeteria
on
these
premises,
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
receive
a
badge,
a
--
a
laminated
--
its
actually
a
laminated
piece
of
--
piece
of
plastic
which
he
hanged
--
hung
on
by
a
chain
around
her
neck,
which
enabled
her
to
go
on
the
premises
and
so
that
anyone
could
see
that
she
had
a
right
there.
in
order
to
get
this
badge,
the
time
she
originally
came
to
work,
she
was
taken
before
the
security
officer
and
she
filled
out
a
form
in
which
she
told
what
her
--
whether
she
had
a
police
record
and
two
or
three
other
questions
it's
in
--
it's
in
the
record
here.
and
on
the
basis
of
this
short
examination,
she
was
given
this
badge,
which
is
the
kind
of
badge
which
is
carried
by
employees
of
sponsored
activities,
they
have
different
colors
of
badges
and
this
one
shows
that
she
is
working
for
a
--
for
the
cafeteria
rather
than
being
an
employee
of
the
gun
factory
directory
--
directly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
i
can.
it's
on
page
--
on
101
of
the
record.
mr.
john
f.
davis
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
but,
it
enabled
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
enables
--
it
enables
the
bearer
of
the
badge
to
go
generally,
within
the
confines
of
the
weapons
plant,
except
that
there
are
certain
areas
there
have
always
been,
i
think
they
are
now,
but
they
were
at
the
time
she
was
there.
there
were
certain
restricted
areas
where
additional
security
measures
were
imposed
and
when
she
couldn't
go
in.
but,
she
could
accept
where
they
were
affiliative
restriction,
she
could
go
anywhere
in
the
gun
--
weapons
plant
or
in
the
annex
with
this
badge.
did
--
there
would
be
--
i'll
point
out
the
place
you
wanted
mr.
justice
harlan?
on
november
14th,
1956,
the
security
officer
determined
that
mrs.
brawner
no
longer
met
the
requirements
which
enabled
her
to
have
access
to
this
plant.
and
he
called
up
the
board
of
--
directed
of
the
board
which
ran
the
cafeteria,
wherein
board
called
up
the
m
&
m
--
office
of
the
m
&
m
cafeterias
which
was
in
the
gun
plant
and
told
them
that
they
should
take
away
her
badge
because
she
was
no
longer
entitled
to
--
to
use
it.
i
don't
want
to
makes
too
much
of
a
point
about
the
language
on
security
clearance
or
security
risk
of
those
terms,
but
i
want
to
say
that
it's
very
apparent
from
what
went
on
here
that
what
was
being
said
was,
not
that
she
was
not
entitled
to
any
general
security
clearance,
but
that
she
was
no
longer
entitled
to
wear
this
badge.
they
want
to
pick
up
the
badge
and
she
no
longer
--
they
felt
she
was
no
longer
a
safe
person
to
have
access
to
the
--
to
the
plant.
it
wasn't
a
--
it
wasn't
a
question
of
security
clearance
generally,
it
was
only
a
question
of
her
right
of
access
to
the
plant
as
such.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
and
i
think
the
distinction
can
be
--
can
be
drawn
between
i
--
i
draw
it
because
of
the
greene
case,
which
i'll
come
to
in
a
minute,
but
i
might
as
well
make
it
--
make
it
clear
now.
in
--
in
the
greene
case,
the
determination
which
was
made
there
was
that
the
scientist
involved
was
not
entitled
generally
to
look
at
any
security
matters,
classified
matters
which
the
government
was
turning
over
to
the
industry
for
use
and
manufacture.
it
was
a
statement
that
he
was
--
until
this
was
removed,
until
he
was
cleared
that
he
would
not
be
permitted
in
the
--
in
any
defense
where
to
look
at
as
classified
materials.
this
is
a
narrower
determination.
this
kind
of
regulation
here
is
a
physical
security
regulation
rarely
of
people
coming
into
a
dangerous
activity.
and
here,
we
have
the
--
the
commandant
of
the
security
officer
of
the
gun
factory,
saying
with
respect
to
this
particular
facility,
this
activity
--
with
everything
that's
going
on
here,
she
shall
not
be
permitted
to
come
into
this
activity.
it's
much
narrower
in
other
words,
it's
a
--
it's
a
question
--
it
--
it
doesn't
say
whether
she's
secure
to
go
other
places
in
the
government
buildings
or
the
naval
buildings
only.
it's
just
a
question
of
their
right
to
come
into
the
--
to
the
gun
factory.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
mean
by
that
that
this
is
a
different
matter
than
her
right
to
look
at
--
i
used
it
to
distinguish
really
from
classified
matter.
this
badge
she
had
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
right
to
look
at
secret
--
top
secret
or
confidential
matter.
i
mean
that's
a
separate
type
of
clearance
under
separate
regulations.
this
--
this
badge
that
she
had
as
this
--
quite
clear,
just
gave
her
a
right
of
access
into
a
gun
factory
and
it's
determinations
as
to
whether
it
should
be
given
to
anybody,
is
whether
a
person
is
a
safe
person
to
have
in
this
particular
sensitive
area.
mr.
john
f.
davis
safe
person.
mr.
john
f.
davis
whether,
she
will
endanger
either
the
property
of
--
or
well
the
--
the
manual
--
the
physical
security
manual
i
think,
i'll
leave
these
manuals
with
the
--
with
the
process
(inaudible)
convenient
to
have.
the
physical
security
manual
talks
about
the
nature
of
the
hazards
which
are
involved
in
--
for
physical
security.
and
the
hazards
in
the
honor
of
--
that
they
give
them,
are
hazards
inherent
in
daily
operations
such
as
accidents,
then
second,
espionage
and
third,
sabotage.
in
other
words,
we're
not
concerned
here
with
whether
mrs.
brawner
is
a
communist
only.
we're
also
concerned
with
whether
or
not,
she
will
sneak
around
and
--
and
steal
government
property.
we're
interested
in
whether
or
not
she's
a
compulsive
smoker
who
will
smoke
in
the
powder
magazines.
and
we
are
also
interested
of
course
in
espionage
and
sabotage,
but
generally
speaking,
it's
a
physical
security
measure
that
you
can
see
where
people
are
going,
you
can
control
what
they're
doing
rather
than
giving
them
any
particular
access
to
any
particular
secret
materials.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
there
is
nothing
in
writing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
she
didn't.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes.
i
think
--
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
she
--
that
this
would
not
prevent
her
from
going
to
other
government
installations,
government
property.
that
this
lifting
her
security
badge,
her
access
badge
for
the
navy
gun
factory,
wouldn't
for
example,
have
any
real
relationship
to
a
right
of
working
at
cafeteria
that
naval
hospital,
out
in
the
fast
drive
wouldn't
think.
so
that
security
problems
are
entirely
different
and
any
security
officer
should
--
would
have
this
in
mind.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
he
--
he
quoted
from
her
union
representative
who
testified
as
to
the
difficulty
of
anyone
who
had
security
clearance
removed
and
whether
he
was
talking
about
this
kind
of
thing
or
whether
he
was
talking
about
the
kind
of
security
clearance
in
greene,
i
don't
know.
but
anyway,
his
--
his
statement
was
based
upon
the
--
the
union
testimony
that
it
would
be
hard
to
find
these
people
jobs
in
any
government
property.
and
--
and
he
said,
he
even
have
to
find
a
new
private
property.
i
--
i
--
there's
nothing
in
the
system
which
makes
this
so,
i
mean,
i
--
i'm
certain
that
if
she
was
going
to
go
into
a
sensitive
area
and
she'd
have
this
and
--
in
their
record
was
the
fact
she'd
been
denied
access
to
the
navy
gun
factory,
the
security
officer
would
look
into
the
reason
for
it
and
if
he
were
--
and
certainly,
it
would
be
examined
into,
i
don't
mean
that
it
would
be
forgotten,
but
i
--
it
certainly
not
conclusive
on
any
other
activity
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
know
of
no,
i
--
i
have
no
information,
no
factual
information
on
it,
as
to
what
has
happened
in
past
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
don't
know
of
any
--
of
any
evidence
on
that
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
can't
think
of
any
ordinary
question
on
the
--
on
a
form
which
would
call
for
this
kind
of
an
answer,
because
--
an
answer
to
this,
because
this
is
no
adjudication
as
to
guilt
or
anything
else.
it's
just
a
question
that
the
commanding
officer
of
the
weapons
factory
for
some
reason
sufficient
to
him,
thought
she
was
not
safe
it
that
vested
area.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
that
that's
--
that's
very
possible.
of
course,
i
do
not
know
what
happened
in
this
case
and
--
and
this
always
--
often
happen
to
my
interns
to
different
reasons
why
was
this
woman
discharged?
i
have
no
idea.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
one
possible
reason
and
again,
it's
--
this
is
made
up
by
whole
both
parties,
is
that
she
was
seen
in
parts
of
the
weapon
plant,
where
she
had
no
business
to
be
and
where
they
were
perhaps,
manufacturing
missile
launchers.
now,
maybe
she
was
there
to
--
and
again,
don't
misunderstand
me
when
i
say
she
was
there,
i
have
no
idea
that
she
was
anywhere
that
she
shouldn't
be,
but
if
that
were
the
basis
of
it,
the
--
the
security
officer
just
felt
he
didn't
want
to
have
an
employee
working
for
the
cafeteria
who
was
--
who
was
going
to
face
us
that
she
--
he
didn't
--
she
had
no
business
and
which
were
sensitive
areas.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
she
would
have
to
say
that
she
had
been
employed
by
the
m
&
m
cafeteria
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
and
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
mr.
justice
black
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
don't
think
although
mr.
dunau
spoke
of
her
--
of
the
government
requiring
her
being
discharged,
i
think
that
this
again
is
a
--
is
a
method
of
description
of
formulating
what
happened.
what
happened
was
that
they
said
that
she
would
have
to
give
up
this
badge
which
gave
her
a
right
to
go
in
and
out
of
the
plant.
now,
obviously
she
can
no
longer
work
for
the
m
&
m
cafeteria
in
that
plant
at
this
time.
but
what
is
actually
the
result
of
lifting
it?
what
was
--
the
result
was
that
the
m
&
m
offered
her
employment
in
another
cafeteria
which
she
found
inconvenient,
but
with
--
the
government
didn't
say
that
she
would
have
to
be
discharged
by
her
employer
and
employer
could
--
could
transfer
her
anywhere
else
that
he
--
where
he
had
used
for
her
--
he
had
no
use
for
he
why
do
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
--
well,
if
we
were
on
government
property
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
if
it
were
out
of
be
--
suppose
it
were
at
the
--
at
the
--
but
there's
a
naval
hospital
for
example,
i
presume
that
i
don't
--
that
they
have
to
get
some
sort
of
security
clearance
to
go
on
the
best
--
and
--
and
i
don't
think
m
&
m
runs
the
cafeteria
there,
but
if
they
did,
then
she
would
have
to
fill
out
some
forms.
the
security
officer
would
have
to
determine
whether
they
wanted
this
woman
in
--
in
that
cafeteria.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
she
would
--
she
would
have
to
say
that,
maybe
--
maybe
this
comes
down
to
the
same
question
which
was
asked,
maybe,
in
order
to
be
coupled,
she
would
have
to
say
that
her
access
to
the
gun
factory
had
been
lifted
and
she
was
no
longer
permitted
to
work
there.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
--
i
might
advise
her
--
well
no,
i
don't
know
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
wouldn't
use
the
term
security
risk,
because
i
don't
think
she
--
that
is
precisely,
i
mean
that's
her
testimony
in
this
language.
she
was
--
it
was
listened
--
lifted
for
security
reasons.
it
was
lifted
because
she
no
longer
was
entitled
to
have
the
badge.
and
again,
i
don't
want
to
cripple
over
words
maybe,
but
the
security
risk
term,
carries
certain
connotations
which
should
are
necessarily
involved
in
lifting
this
badge.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
she
did
what?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
now
--
in
--
in
this
case,
take
this
case,
she
was
offered
as
i
say,
she
was
told,
she
no
longer
could
act
--
to
have
access
to
the
naval
gun
factory.
so,
the
--
her
employer
said,
we
--
we
can't
--
any
longer
an
employee
of
them,
we're
going
to
transfer
you
to
the
sky-lit
motel
which
is
at
springfield.
springfield
by
the
way,
is
about
the
same
distance
from
washington
to
--
to
splurge
church
and
when
mr.
dunau
says
it's
three
hours
to
and
from,
he
means
an
hour
and
a
half
each
way,
not
three
hours
each
way
and
that's
by
bus.
she
--
she
decided
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
a
job
she
wanted.
now,
she
wasn't
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
this
was
a
motel.
she
decided
that
the
transportation
was
too
difficult
or
far,
as
she
lives
somewhere
in
southeast
and
it
would
cost
her
money
and
take
her
time
to
go
there.
her
husband
worked
at
the
bureau
of
engraving
and
probably,
it
wasn't
convenient
to
move
out
there
for
this
job
and
she
didn't
want
to
take
this
transfer.
so,
you
can
answer
that
--
she
could
answer
this
question
in
a
number
of
ways.
she
certainly
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
perjury,
if
she
put
down
on
the
application
that
she
ceased
to
be
employed
by
m
&
m,
because
she
refused
a
transfer,
refused
to
accept
the
transfer
from
the
naval
gun
factory
to
the
--
to
the
sky-lit
motel,
which
is
the
fact.
now,
this
isn't
a
full
disclosure
and
if
i
were
advising
her
on
a
security
problem,
i
think,
i
would
think
she
ought
to
make
up
a
fuller
disclosure,
but
i
don't
think
she
could
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
for
answering
in
that
way.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
wouldn't
take
a
risk
if
i
were
advising
her
either.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
it
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
change
it
because
i
think
that
what
happens
here
is
that
she
--
at
the
--
what
all
the
government
does
is
to
lift
her
badge
and
so
whenever
she's
talking
about
losing
employment,
she
is
losing
employment,
the
government
doesn't
order
her
to
be
--
ceased
to
be
employed.
we
have
to
look
further
and
see
what
happens.
in
this
case,
we
know
what
happened.
she
was
offered
to
transfer
to
another
place.
if
there
were
no
other
place
to
go,
she
couldn't
be
employed
here
and
the
lifting
of
the
badge
would
be
directly
responsible
for
her
ceasing
to
be
employed
by
the
m
&
m.
that's
--
that's
perfectly
clear,
because
she
couldn't
--
she
could
no
longer
--
she
could
no
longer
work
there.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
as
far
as
the
--
as
the
security
system
goes,
that
each
one
of
these
facilities,
i
don't
think
it's
a
good
thing
to
have
in
a
record.
i
--
of
course,
it
isn't,
but
each
one
of
these
activities
has
its
own
security
problems.
this
particular
naval
gun
factory
was
a
particularly
sensitive
area.
and
the
fact
that
this
woman
was
not
in
--
safe
employee
for
--
for
this
kind
of
a
manufacturing
developmental
weapons
plant.
it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
whether
she's
a
safe
employee
for
some
--
some
other
place.
mr.
john
f.
davis
security
clearances
as
of
all
kinds,
you
mean
such
as
the
green
one
as
well
as
this
one?
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we've
--
we
are
fortunate
in
having
a
brief
amicus
found
by
the
american
federation
of
labor
and
congress
of
industrial
organizations
is
amicus
curiae
and
the
burden
of
this
brief
has
to
point
out
the
pervasiveness
of
the
security
program
and
it
just
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
figures
which
gives
specific
figures
about
federal
employees
and
employees
of
industrial
plants
and
so
far
as
i
know,
these
figures
can
be
accepted
as
absolutely
accurate.
i
have
no
--
no
question
about
that.
i
will
say
though
that
i
think
that
we
must
deal
not
with
the
security
program
as
a
whole.
i
think
we've
got
a
very
particular
problem
here
in
--
in
connection
with
this
type
of
security
and
i
think
that
we
must
look
not
at
--
what's
done
with
respect
to
classified
materials.
we
must
--
we
must
--
we
don't
have
to
look
--
reconsider
the
greene
case.
i
think
that
this
is
a
different
case
from
the
greene
case.
i
think
that
really,
that's
the
first
problem
we
have
to
face
in
this
argument,
is
this
case
really
governed
by
greene
against
mcelroy?
now,
in
greene
against
mcelroy,
this
court
gave
very
--
considered
very
serious
attention
to
the
fact
that
mr.
greene
was
an
aeronomical
engineer
and
that
the
refusal
of
giving
him
clearance
to
security
materials,
in
fact,
prevented
him
from
carrying
on
his
chosen
profession
that
he's
been
trained
for.
i'm
not
drawing
a
distinction
now
between
cooks
and
aeronautical
engineers.
it
has
--
they
have
the
same
effect
of
cooks,
why
there
would
be
no
difference.
but,
this
is
a
very
different
matter,
mrs.
brawner
is
--
can
continue
to
carry
on
her
activities
generally.
she
is
required
certainly,
to
transfer
her
activities
from
the
gun
factory
to
somewhere
else.
she's
possibly,
she's
--
has
impairments
as
to
employment
in
other
naval
operations,
but
she
is
not
forced
out
of
her
chosen
endeavor.
she
is
instead
excluded
from
a
particular
area,
excluded
from
carrying
on
her
--
her
activities
in
that
particular
area.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
it
was
rejected
him.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
she
has
worked
half
time.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
the
distinction
is
between
an
aeronautical
engineer
were
almost
all
its
business
is
with
the
government
and
where
he
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
has
been
barred
from
doing
any
government
work,
because
the
--
the
withholding
of
his
right,
prevented
him
from
--
from
doing
--
from
having
access
to
classified
matter,
that
was
across
the
board.
mrs.
brawner
required
to
give
up
the
specific
employment
in
the
cafeteria
on
the
gun
factory.
she
is
permitted,
she
is
not
required
to
be
discharged
by
her
employer
and
in
fact,
her
employer
offered
her
a
position
in
the
sky-lit
motel.
if
she
doesn't
want
that,
she
is
not
by
law
or
in
fact,
barred
from
other
government
installations.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
she
finds
it
difficult
to
get
a
job
in
other
government
applications,
cooks
generally
don't
work
only
for
the
government.
their
cooks
work
for
any
number
of
cafeterias.
in
fact
of
the
--
the
union
represents
cafeteria
workers
that
worked
for
all
the
large
cafeterias
in
--
in
washington.
this
--
this
woman
is
not
really
disbarred
from
--
from
going
on
with
--
from
her
work.
she
is,
what
she
is
--
what
has
happened
to
her,
is
she's
barred
from
the
naval
gun
factory.
now,
we've
made
the
same
argument
in
greene
and
you
rejected
it
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
very
much
a
matter
of
degree
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
insofar
as
degree
and
principles,
i
think
that
if
when
their
things
are
different
enough
in
degree,
you
come
out
at
different
results.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
--
the
basic
question
that
we
have
here,
is
whether
this
was
taken
away
in
a
manner
which
deprives
her
of
--
of
what
it
was
authorized
and
whether
it
deprives
her
of
due
process.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
shall
try
to
do
so.
the
first
question
then
is
a
question
of
authority,
whether
the
command
--
the
commandant
and
the
security
officer
had
authority
to
impose
the
security
system,
to
require
her
to
have
a
badge,
to
take
away
the
badge,
if
they
feel
and
felt
that
she
was
not
a
safe
person
on
--
on
the
property.
we
set
forth
in
our
appendix
at
page
91,
the
general
statutes
which
in
--
which
give
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
one
custody
of
the
property
of
the
navy,
until
to
give
him
authority
to
make
regulations
with
respect
to
its
preservation.
this
is
a
general
authority.
it's
in
the
most
general
terms
that
this
--
that
this
general
authority
was
intended
to
cover
regulations
dealing
with
access
to
naval
property,
is
given
weight
by
the
provision
in
the
criminal
code
which
is
cited
on
page
92
of
our
brief,
which
makes
it
a
crime
for
anyone
to
go
on
any
military,
naval
or
cost
guard
reservation
post,
fort,
arsenal
yard
and
so
forth,
for
any
purpose
prohibited
by
law
or
lawful
regulation,
which
i
take
it
as
a
recognition
of
the
prior-given
authority
to
make
regulations.
so
that,
i
think
that
as
far
as
congress
is
concerned,
it
would
be
almost
inconceivable
that
they
wouldn't
give
the
navy
power
to
deny
people
access
to
the
--
to
their
property,
but
in
fact,
they
have
specifically
done
so.
we
go
from
the
authority
which
is
found
in
the
statutes
to
the
authority
and
the
regulations
and
that
is
cited
on
page
92,
93,
94
of
our
brief
and
this
is
in
the
general
navy
regulations.
and
again,
this
is
in
general
terms,
but
it
imposes
the
obligation
to
preserve
the
safety
of
activities
upon
the
"commanding
officer."
this
is
found
in
article
0701.
and
then
in
0733,
the
commanding
officer
is
given
the
responsibility
for
--
for
the
control
of
visitors
to
the
activities
of
his
activity.
and
immediate
below
that,
we
find
the
specific
regulation
with
respect
to
the
admittance
of
dealers,
tradesman
or
their
agents,
which
i
take
it
includes
people
like
cafeterias,
who
are
selling
food
to
the
people
on
the
--
on
the
--
in
the
installation.
and
as
i
say,
this
regulation
is
the
regulation
which
gave
the
commanding
officer
of
the
gun
factory
the
authority
to
give
and
take
away
the
right
of
access.
now,
he
could
have
done
this
i
suppose,
by
going
himself
to
the
gate
or
sending
an
officer
to
the
gate
and
as
each
person
came
in,
he
could've
look
at
the
man
and
said,
"you
can
come
in
and
you
can
go
out,"
on
whatever
basis
he
thought
was
reasonable,
but
this
wouldn't
work.
i
mean,
people
who
are
coming
in
regularly
and
going
out
regularly,
you
don't
want
to
have
to
screen
them
each
time
and
it's
the
--
under
the
regular
manuals
and
i
think
the
manuals
are
somewhat
different
from
the
regulations,
because
they're
really
instructions
to
the
officers
how
they
carry
out
these
duties.
their
internal
housekeeping
devices
that
tell
the
--
tell
the
commanders
what
they
should
do,
how
they
could
carry
out
their
duties.
they'd
suggest
in
there
that
method
of
access
to
--
to
a
controlled
area
should
be
through
badges
of
this
kind
and
it
was
under
the
general
authority
and
the
instruction
in
the
manuals
that
the
commanding
officer
in
this
case
made
mrs.
brawner
sign
the
application
when
she
came
in,
gave
her
the
badge
and
took
it
away
when
he
felt
that
she
no
longer
--
that
she
no
longer
fulfill
the
requirements
which
entitled
her
to
have
a
badge.
in
connection
with
--
with
the
--
going
on
to
government
--
to
military
property
and
going
off,
there's
a
long
history
of
this
being
done
at
the
discretion
of
the
commanding
officer.
i
say
this,
because
in
the
greene
case,
when
we
were
discussing
authority,
when
the
court
discussed
the
authority
to
impose
the
regulations
which
were
there
involved,
they
found
that
there
should
be
a
specific
authorization
to
give
or
to
take
away
security
clearance
without
the
right
of
confrontation
of
witnesses.
it
was
--
it
was
felt
that
if
there
was
an
intention
to
give
that
power
to
take
away
clearance
without
confrontation
of
witnesses
that
this
should
be
specifically
spelled
out
and
that
was
the
basis
on
which
this
court
said
that
there
was
no
authority
to
issue
the
regulations.
now,
the
entire
history
of
the
handling
of
people
going
on
military
reserve
--
reservations
from
as
far
back
as
i
can
find,
is
been
handled
without
a
hearing
or
without
a
right
to
confront
accusers.
it's
been
done
on
a
--
on
a
basis
of
the
discretion
of
the
commanding
officer
to
the
persons
to
whom
he
gives
that
--
gives
the
--
the
delegates
the
authority.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
the
--
the
instances
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
the
--
and
the
decisions
of
the
judge
advocate
general,
a
full
of
cases
were
people
do
have
status.
now
the
first,
the
first
instance
that
i
cite
is
that
an
opinion
not
at
the
judge
but
of
the
attorney
general
given
to
the
secretary
of
war
in
1837.
and
this
dealt
with
the
right
of
a
man
who
had
leased
a
house,
who
had
--
who
lived
on
--
on
the
reservation
at
--at
west
point,
so
that
this
man
had
considerable
status
to
go
in
and
come
out
and
actually
what
he
was
doing
as
i
--
as
i
remember
the
facts
and
the
--
and
the
opinion
was
that
he
and
his
--
and
his
family
were
out
conducting
a
lumbering
operation
on
some
far
corner
of
the
reservation
and
this
--
the
commandant
of
the
reservation
didn't
think
that
this
was
an
appropriate
thing
to
do
and
he
actually
barred
him
from
coming
onto
the
reservation
under
the
--
under
the
west
point.
and
somehow
or
other,
the
question
got
to
the
--
to
the
attorney
general
and
the
attorney
general
gave
an
opinion
to
the
secretary
of
war
that
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
discretion,
the
command
--
commandant
of
the
post,
may
therefore,
order
from
that
any
person
not
attached
to
it
by
law,
whose
presence
is
and
his
judgment
in
jury
as
to
the
interest
of
the
academy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
question
of
attached
--
attaching
to
is
a
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
generally
used
with
respect
to
the
military
and
in
this
case,
it
was
also
the
postmaster
general
--
there
was
a
postmaster
who
was
attached
by
line.
mr.
john
f.
davis
this
suits
up
--
this
makes
under
this
manual
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
--
that
is
right.
this
is
a
manual
in
connection
with
security
matters
and
that
this
binds
visitors
for
the
purposes
of
that
manual
and
under
that
manual,
she
is
a
visitor.
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
there
is
a
separate
manual
for
physical
security
and
under
that
i
think
she
also
would
be
considered
to
be
a
visitor.
i
--
but
i
--
i
really
think
i'm
--
our
authority
here
goes
beyond
whether
or
not,
she's
a
visitor.
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
general
authority
of
a
--
of
a
commander
of
a
--
commanding
officer
of
one
of
these
installations,
goes
also
to
--
to
civilian
employees
as
far
as
that
goes
to
--
within
certain
limits
i
suppose
the
military
employees
too,
the
military
people,
too.
even
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
we
haven't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
the
constitutionality
of
--
of
the
--
the
authority,
i
think
that
we
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
totally
get
to
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
we
have
to
get
by
greene
and
i
don't
know
what
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
have
got
by
greene
or
not,
but
this
is
what
we
have
to
do
before
we
get
to
the
question.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that's
right
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
think
that
when
you
get
the
general
authority
to
control
access
and
the
history
of
what's
been
done
under
it,
that
you
have
plenty
of
authority
in
here
and
i
don't
wish
to
limit
the
authority
of
the
commanding
generals
to
visitors
either
--
as
their
expressed
in
these
manuals.
although
i
think,
it's
clear
that
there
is
a
visitor
and
there
is
power
over
visitors.
i
think
that
the
power
is
much
--
much
wider
than
that.
i
think
that
the
most
useful
thing
i
can
do
on
these
manuals
which
is
i
say,
i
think
our
instructions
to
the
officers,
is
how
do
they
carry
out
their
duties,
rather
than
regulations
in
the
sense
of
being
general
rules
for
--
for
the
public.
i
think,
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
leave
copies
with
the
clerk
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
these
regulations?
mr.
john
f.
davis
these
manuals
--
the
manuals
that
i'm
going
to
present
will
be
the
manuals
i
think
that
were
in
effect
at
the
time
mrs.
brawner
was
involved,
although
one
of
them
is
brought
up
to
date
because
we
referred
to
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
these
are
just
the
current
one.
i
haven't
attempted
to
get
the
old
ones
that
--
that
paper
--
that
paper
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
these
are
not
printed
in
the
federal
register.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
are
--
they
are
--
they're
not
public
documents
either.
the
navy
instructions
given
them
the
--
in
order
to
obtain
them,
well,
there
are
in
many
libraries
because
there's
nothing
confidential
about
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
they're
in
--
they're
in
our
library
in
the
department
and
i
--
whether
they're
in
your
library,
i
don't
know,
but
they've
--
they're
not
--
they're
not
restricted
in
any
way
or
just
be
that
they
are
internal
housekeeping
documents
and
no
one
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
now,
there's
--
i
think
there's
one
regulation
i
should
mention
because
it
is
discussed
this
morning
and
that's
the
army
regulation
with
respect
to
insurance.
it's
a
--
particular
regulation
with
respect
to
selling
insurance
on
army
post.
the
copy
which
was
referred
to
this
morning
is
one
that
came
into
effect
in
1958
which
was
after
the
date
mrs.
brawner
was
transferred,
but
they
were
prior
regulations
in
1953
and
whether
they
have
the
same
conditions,
i
don't
know.
but
these
are
regulations
which
the
army
puts
out
in
connection
with
protecting
its
personnel
from
insurance
salesmen.
sounds
as
though,
they
were
the
enemy,
but
apparently
there
are
some
--
some
necessity
to
--
to
protect
young
men
coming
into
the
--
into
the
army
from
buying
insurance
that
they
don't
need.
and
so,
this
regulation
ar
600-101,
which
i'll
leave
with
the
clerk,
provides
certain
limitations
on
when
insurance,
where
they
can
go
and
who
they
can
sell.
and
it
says
for
example,
if
they
shunt
sell
individuals
engaged
in
basic
training
and
they
shunt
sell
them
when
they
sell
it,
while
they're
being
processed
for
overseas
shipment
and
they
mustn't
solicit
in
the
barracks.
and
these
are
regulations,
general
regulations
which
are
supplement
--
which
is
circulated.
and
if
an
agent
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
these
particular
regulations
don't
deal
with
jehovah's
witnesses.
i
don't
--
i
haven't
looked
up
jehovah's
witness.
there
-
there
is
a
case
of
course,
dealing
with
the
way
the
jehovah's
witness
--
and
one
of
the
--
of
the
judge's
opinions,
one
of
the
judge's
asked
to
get
general's
opinions
upholds
the
authority
of
a
commanding
officer
to
exclude
jehovah.
i
think
it
was
jehovah's
witness.
it
was
one
of
the
sets
from
soliciting
personnel
on
--
on
his
military
post.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
didn't
--
didn't
really
want
to
keep
--
he
wanted
the
--
to
tell
them
what
to
do.and
as
in
all
these
cases,
what
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
did
well
--
this
is
--
this
was
issued
in
army
regulation,
this
was
issued
by
the
maxwell
taylor,
general
of
the
united
states
army.
it's
his
regular
--
regulation
it's
the
--
it's
the
army
regulation
fined
in
the
entire
army.
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
headquarters
of
the
department
of
the
army.
the
--
the
army
felt
that
in
order
to
control
this,
it
was
reasonable
to
tell
the
agents
what
they
could
and
couldn't
do.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
then
they
would
went
further
and
said,
if
we're
going
to
take
away
their
rights
on
the
basis
of
regulations
like
this,
we
are
to
give
them
a
hearing
because
if
we're
accused
--
if
we're
throwing
them
off
because
they
failed
to
do
some
--
follow
a
regulation,
then
we
are
to
--
we
are
to
give
them
a
right
to
be
heard
on
whether
they
have
complied
with
the
regulation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
do
they
have
--
they
are
--
there
are
places
they
were
excluded
from
there
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
suppose
they
do.
i
mean
these
times
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
they
have
to
come
to
work
and
times
that
they
have
to
leave
and
then
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
wear
there
badge
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
areas
where
they're
restricted,
where
they
can't
go.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they're
not
--
those
are
not
general
regulations
for
the
conduct
of
the
business.
those
are
security
regulations,
security
orders
with
respect
to
the
--
the
physical
security
of
the
plant.
and
the
authority
is
so
much
broader
with
respect
to
--
the
--
an
officer,
a
common
--
a
commanding
officer
just
preserving
safety
that
it's
entirely
possible
the
--
the
--
his
power
goes
beyond
this
particular
regulation.
he's
got
--
if
for
any
reason
he
believes
the
person
isn't
safe,
he
--
he
can
exclude
them.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
he
--
i
think
he
can
with
an
individual
insurance
agent.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
he
can
with
an
individual
insurance
agent,
if
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
suppose
an
insurance
agent
comes
on
intoxicated,
there's
nothing
in
this
about
intoxicated
agents,
he
can
--
he
can
throw
the
agent
off
and
--
and
keep
him
off
because
that
doesn't
come
within
this
particular
type
of
regulation.
it's
like
so
many
other
fields
in
--
in
government,
that
if
you're
going
to
set
up
rules
and
regulations,
if
you're
going
to
take
up
the
procedural
sword,
so
to
speak
and
tell
people
give
them
a
--
a
procedure,
then
you'd
have
to
follow
your
own
procedure.
and
if
he
sets
up
a
procedure
for
conducting
insurance
business,
then
he
has
to
follow
it.
but
if
he
is
going
to
say,
in
my
discretion,
i'm
going
to
preserve
the
safety
of
this
post,
that's
a
different
matter.
he
doesn't
have
to
take
up
the
procedural
sword
and
so,
he
doesn't
ever
have
to
follow
through
with
--
with
any
regulations
which
she
hasn't
adopted.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
perfectly
certain
it
would.
and
i'm
perfectly
certain
that
these
regulations
and
there
none
in
the
navy,
by
the
way,
this
is
an
army
one.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
i'm
--
i'm
perfectly
sure
that
if
the
situation
--
the
commanding
officer
that
has
the
same
power,
that
with
respect
not
to
caring
on
the
insurance
business,
not
violating
these
regulations,
but
with
the
respect
to
coming
on
the
post
at
the
wrong
time,
going
into
certain
wrong
areas,
misbehaving
in
other
ways,
that
he
has
exactly
the
same
powers
with
respect
to
insurance
agents
that
he
has
with
respect
to
anybody
else.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
he
could.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
he'd
have
no
right
to
a
hearing
under
this
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
is
a
protection
because
if
it's
carried
out
in
(inaudible)
which
it's
done,
because
they
are
not
in
concern
with
security.
they're
concerned
with
selling
insurance
and
they
don't
want
this
people
to
--
to
be
harassing
or
--
or
acting
improperly
in
a
--
in
a
particular
area.
that's
--
that's
very
different
from
the
security
area.
this
is
a
matter
of
personnel
protection.
i
don't
want
to
get
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
this
is
just
an
army
regulation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
is
no,
i
filed
it
and
i
say
this
with
--
with
some
humility.
i
can't
--
l
don't
think
there
is
any
navy
regulation.
the
regulate
--
the
manuals
and
regulations
in
the
armed
services,
that
they're
very
--
very
many
of
them,
but
i
think
there
is
none
which
deals
specifically
with
insurance
on
navy
installations.
now,
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
spend
some
--
excuse
me
--
i
want
to
spend
some
time
with
the
--
with
the
constitutional
issue.
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
last
few
years
that
a
person's
right
to
a
job
and
a
person's
right
not
to
be
fired
from
a
job
for
improper
reasons
will
be
protected
under
the
due
process
clause
or
under
the
--
or
under
the
equal
protection
clause
as
the
case
may
be.
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
in
no
case
that
i
have
found
preceded
from
the
position
that
people
can
be
discharged
from
their
positions
and
i
thought
from
this
although,
i
think
that
this
lady
was
not
discharging
that
position.
but
people
can
be
discharged
from
their
positions
without
hearings
and
without
a
chance
to
meet
their
accusers.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
our
civil
service
act,
the
--
the
law
in
lloyd-la
follette
act,
itself.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry.
the
first
time
that
i
know
of
and
i
haven't
checked
it
back,
is
1912,
when
there
was
--
when
they
were
required
to
give
the
hearings
to
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
when
the
first
civil
service
act
was
--
was
before
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right,
but
the
first
time
that
the
employer
was
required
to
give
reasons
and
give
the
employee
a
chance
to
reply,
i
think
was
in
1912.
i
may
be
wrong
on
this,
but
that's
the
--
because
of
the
lloyd-la
follette
act.
and
in
that
case,
it
is
specifically
stated
and
--
and
it's
on
the
law
books
today
that
the
employee
is
not
entitled
to
a
hearing.
now,
there
are
many
--
there
are
many
situations
where
--
under
special
circumstances
hearings
are
required
and
where
this
is
so,
how
our
regulations
give
a
right
to
a
hearing,
they
must
be
--
they
must
be
--
the
procedure
must
be
followed.
but
in
the
absence
of
--
of
such
a
--
of
such
a
special
situation,
i
think
the
law
today
is
as
it
has
been
throughout
history
of
this
country
that
a
government
employee
can
be
discharged
without
a
hearing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
government
employee,
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
that
wasn't
exactly
the
--
the
line
i
was
going
to
follow.
i
was
going
to
point
out
that
here,
we
do
not
have
a
serious
a
--
an
interference
as
a
discharge.
here,
what
we
have
--
all
we
have
is
a
refusal
of
the
let
a
person
come
on
the
property,
so
that
the
person
is
not
told
that
he
can
--
he's
not
in
effect
directly
or
indirectly,
told
that
he
can
no
longer
work
for
the
employer.
all
he
is
told
is
that
he
cannot
work
for
that
employer
on
this
particular
property.
mr.
john
f.
davis
and
when
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
is
the
government
or
anybody
else.
i
mean,
i
think
this
is
a
rather
lesser
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
do
not
think
he
has
anymore
right
to
come
under
the
government
property
after
an
order
has
been
given
that
he
must
stay
off,
because
he
has
some
private
employment.
i
don't
think
that
gives
him
any
right
to
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
here
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
think
under
the
greene
case
that
you
have
held
that
this
is
so.
i
think
that
under
the
greene
case
--
what
you
haven't
held
it's
so,
because
you
don't
deal
with
constitutionality
there,
but
you
have
expressed
grave
doubts
whether
the
government
could
affect
the
--
directly
the
--
the
employment
by
mr.
greene
with
his
--
with
his
private
employer.
but
here,
here
we
have
a
different
situation
and
i
--
i
come
back
to
this
that
what
we're
dealing
with
is
not
a
direct
impingement
upon
the
employment
at
all,
that's
the
effect
of
what
happens.
but
all
that
this
man
--
all
that
the
government
is
doing
in
this
case,
is
denying
these
people
access
--
access
to
government
property.
that's
what's
actually
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
might
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
might
in
some
cases
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
be
practical,
the
same
thing.
but
in
mr.
greene's
case
--
dr.
greene's
case
for
example,
if
he
had
been
denied
access
to
the
naval
gun
factory
as
such,
this
wouldn't
prevented
him
from
carrying
on
to
work
other
places.
i
mean,
he
still
--
it
would
be
a
very
different
case
than
--
than
the
--
than
the
situation
which
happened
where
there
was
in
across
the
board
denial
of
his
right
to
--
to
this
employment,
anywhere.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
i
do
not
question
at
all
that
mrs.
greene
is
--
had
suffered
harm,
from
the
fact
that
she
was
denied
access
to
the
--
to
the
naval
gun
factory.
i'm
--
i'm
sure
she
suffered
harm,
financial
harm
and
--
and
possibly
to
her
--
to
her
morale.
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
only
question
is,
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
a
right
that
one
must
give
at
hearing
for.
there
are
many
cases
where
people
have
suffered
harm,
right
to
--
the
right
to
employment.
mrs.--
mrs.
brawner
appears
and
asked
for
a
job
and
they
deny
her
a
job,
although
she's
really
qualified
for
it.
mrs.
brawner
wants
a
raise,
they
--
they
refused
to
give
her
a
raise.
they
don't
tell
her
why.
they
just
don't
give
it
to
her.
and
--
there
--
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
employee-employer
relationships
where
the
discretion
is
left
with
the
employer
and
we
haven't
ever
held
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing
in
the
case.
and
i
think
--
i
think
this
is
one
of
them
and
it
--
it
did
--
it
doesn't
mean
the
person
isn't
--
isn't
hurt
by
it.
it
maybe
hurt
and
if
it's
unfair,
then
--
the
--
the
remedy
is
through
labor
relations
work,
representatives,
the
union
are
in
the
case
of
the
armed
services,
her
remedy
would
be
to
go
up
the
chain
of
command
to
try
to
get
this
--
this
injury
right
on
it.
there
was
an
injury,
but
the
right
isn't
to
get
a
hearing
and
--
and
to
apply
to
this
kind
of
thing,
the
due
process
clause.
you
can't
--
it's
hard
to
go
halfway
on
giving
a
due
process
of
life.
they're
going
to
give
a
hearing
and
a
right
to
--
to
face
accuses.
it
gets
soon
into
a
fact
that
it
these
personnel
matters,
they
have
to
have
a
trial.
once
they've
started
in
giving
procedures,
it's
hard
to
stop
halfway.
now,
i
think
that
when
i
say
that
they
can
do
this,
i
don't
necessarily
say
that's
a
desirable
thing
to
do.
i
would
think
that
the
only
fair
thing
to
do
in
normal
circumstances
is
to
tell
somebody
why
their
security
badge
is
being
lifted.
it
seems
to
me
that
anyone
will
do
that,
but
there
--
there
are
circumstances
where
this
cannot
be
done.
i
mean
the
--
this
very
disclosure
of
the
reason
why
they
are
lifting
it,
may
--
may
lead
to
security
problems
in
itself.
in
that
case,
it's
appropriate
to
--
to
just
exercise
the
discretion
arbitrarily.
this,
of
course,
is
not
also
it
--
the
badge
of
infamy
--
the
badge
of
infamy
characterization
of
this
--
of
this
kind
of
action
is
--
is
really
not
appropriate,
because
in
all
likelihood,
in
this
--
in
this
case
of
access
to
gun
plant
and
the
question
isn't
whether
she's
a
communist
or
has
communist
leanings,
he's
loyal
or
--
or
disloyal.
the
chances
are
and
we
can't
tell
what
the
real
reason
is,
but
the
chances
are
--
are
that
she
was
in
some
way,
thought
to
be
endangering
the
property
of
the
--
of
the
gun
factory.
well,
therefore
when
--
when
the
badge
is
lifted,
she's
not
branded
as
a
traitor,
she's
not
branded
in
anyway.
all
you
do
is
to
lift
the
badge.
but
if
anyone
knows
about
it,
all
they
know
is
that
there
is
a
particular,
sensitive
area
where
people
felt
that
it
was
not
appropriate
that
she
should
work.
and
this
is
a
very
different
thing
from
an
attack
on
her
loyalty.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they
don't
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
don't
mr.
chief
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
they
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
don't
if
--
if
this
is
talked
about
in
terms
of
security
risk
as
such
or
security
clearance
or
that
kind
of
thing.
i
mean
that,
because
it's
been
used
so
much
in
this
communist
control
cases
that
more
or
less
carries
that
thought.
but
there
was
--
there's
nothing
that
the
navy
did
in
this
case,
which
in
--
puts
this
badge
upon
mrs.
brawner.
all
they
did
was
asked
her
for
a
badge,
they
said,
"you
are
not
a
safe
person
on
the
naval
gun
factory."
