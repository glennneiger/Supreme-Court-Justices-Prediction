chief

mr.
davis.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
writing
to
indicate
the
distinction
between
the
kinds
of
revocation
that
was
given
to
this
petitioner
on
the
one
hand
and
that
given
to
greene
on
the
other?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
she
get
anything
in
writing
to
show
the
nature
of
her
disability,
by
reason
of
this
revocation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
she
would
be
admitted
to
any
place
in
sensitive
place,
in
the
government
establishment
with
this
kind
of
revocation
that
greene
could
not
have
gone
into
--
with
that
kind
of
revocation
that
he
received?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
--
is
there
any
experience
that
you
know
of,
of
the
government
to
indicate
how
these
revocations
are
treated,
when
one
goes
to
get
another
job
at
the
government
service?
in
other
words,
isn't
at
all
likely
that
the
employment
having
had
--
had
that
badge
taken
away
from
her,
would
be
able
to
get
employment
in
any
branch
of
the
service?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
if
she
went
to
work
or
sought
to
go
to
work
in
another
government
agency
and
that
question
was
asked,
who'd
you
last
work
for
and
why
did
you
leave?
what
--
what
would
she
--
could
she
honestly
say?
what
could
be
your
advice
to
her
as
to
what
to
say
and
not
given
a
trouble
for
misstating
facts
to
the
--
to
the
government?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
it
because
she
was
a
security
risk?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we're
talking
about
--
that's
the
only
knowledge
she
has,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
wonder
it
would
make
any
--
i
wonder
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
wonder
if
that
would
make
any
difference
in
your
argument
to
your
position
in
the
--
in
the
case
if
the
employer
only
had
one
cafeteria,
the
one
from
which
she
--
she
was
ejected.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
would
that
--
would
that
change
--
it
changed
your
position
because
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
it
doesn't,
i
--
i
didn't
want
to
--
to
ask
you,
what
kind
of
an
answer
she
would
make?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
practical
matter,
wouldn't
be
a
bar
to
any
government
employment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
argument
--
same
argument
was
made
in
greene
and
he
wasn't
deprived
of
anything
except
that
he
wasn't
to
have
admission
to
this
particular
plant.
he
could
go
any
place
in
the
world
that
he
wanted
and
pursue
his
profession.
that
was
argued
here
and
this
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
it
was
rejected
on
the
theory
that
--
that
this
business
was
such
that
he
--
he
couldn't
get
it
with
that
back
--
with
that
background.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
have
we
any
reason
to
believe
that
--
that
a
cook
is
not
in
the
same
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
greene
--
mr.
greene
had
employment.
alright,
the
only
thing
he
--
instead
of
having
a
$20,000
job,
he
had
to
take
a
--
a
draftsman's
job,
which
is
this
--
a
subordinate
job
and
made
4,
5
-
$6000
a
year.
but
he
got
employment,
he
--
he
kept
from
starving
and
i
suppose
this
woman
could
keep
from
starving
in
some
way
or
the
other,
but
as
i
understood
mr.
dunau,
she's
been
able
work
about
half
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
has
worked
about
half
time.
but
i
--
i
don't
see
the
distinction.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
wasn't
that
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
a
matter
of
degree
and
not
a
principle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
principle?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
davis,
i
was
wondering
if
--
if
the
commanding
officer
has
unlimited
discretion
to
--
to
keep
off
of
the
--
of
the
installation,
anybody
that
he
wants
to.
why
is
it
necessary
to
have
a
--
the
regulation
of
this
kind
giving
insurance
agents
the
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
is
he
--
who
is
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
don't
these
people
like
--
like
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
have
certain
regulations
that
they
must
live
under,
when
they're
on
--
on
the
government
installation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
not
they're
excluded
from
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
while
they're
there,
don't
they
have
to
live
under
certain
regulations?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
where
they
can
go
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
they
can
go?
where
--
where
they
can't
go
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
that
--
why
isn't
that
the
same
as
the
insurance
cases?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
can't
with
an
insurance
agent.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
wasn't
that
a
regulation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
would
--
wouldn't
a
necessity
for
protecting
this
safety
of
the
post,
replied
to
insurance,
you
mean,
does
it
much
of
cooks?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
could
he
throw
him
off
and
not
--
and
not
give
him
any
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
he
--
he
insists
of
a
hearing
under
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
he
could
just
throw
him
off
and
give
him
no
reason
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
give
him
no
reason
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
this
is
no
protection
to
him
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
even
mr.
davis,
if
she
goes
to
another
place
to
work,
her
minimum
loss
is
six
years
of
seniority.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well
that's
why
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
the
public
makes
that
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
--
all
the
numbers
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
had
played
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
do
you
think
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
public
makes
a
difference
between
security
risk
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
loyalty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dunau.
