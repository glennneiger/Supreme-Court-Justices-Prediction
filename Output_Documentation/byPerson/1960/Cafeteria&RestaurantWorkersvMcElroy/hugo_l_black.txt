justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer
about
the
--
what
you
have
to
say.
i
would
assume
that
all
applications
would
require
you
to
tell
where
you
have
been
employed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
you
had
left.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
is
case
with
the
one
to
which
you
referred
to
us
on
page
101.
so
does
she
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
go
somewhere
else,
she
would
have
to
comment
wouldn't
she?
justice
hugo
l.
black
reasons
--
and
reasons
for
changing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
know
what
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
you'd
have
to
sign
an
application
like
this,
with
your
statement
like
this
when
she
went
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
she
failed
to
tell
him
and
she
has
to
slather,
isn't
not,
it
wouldn't
be
much
trouble
to
show
that
she's
in
guilt
of
perjury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
would
--
if
she
answered
one
of
the
three
questions,
that's
101
did
not
tell
about
this
entry,
i
would
assume
that
she
had
to
swear
to
the
statement
that
she
could
be
part
of
subversion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
government
work?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
in
your
brief
or
there
--
is
there
available,
any
statistics
on
the
number
of
employees
in
america
today,
who
worked
for
companies
that
has
--
who
have
contracts
with
the
government,
where
the
government
can
and
does
require
security
risk?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
all
the
employees
of
the
nation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
i
have
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
referring
that
to
a
government
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
going
to
discuss
the
difference
as
there
is
any
must
show
why
there
is
no
difference,
may
the
government's
right
to
interfere
with
employment
somebody
who
does
not
work
for
the
government
and
one
could
work
for
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
discuss
that
i
assume,
from
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
standpoint
that
he's
the
employer
of
somebody
else,
not
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
constitutional
power
is
precisely
the
same?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
asked
you
the
question
because
originally,
the
idea
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
law
of
the
land,
related
to
what
was
done
by
government
to
these
people,
not
what
was
done
by
government
so
far
as
the
employees
of
other
people.
what
do
they
do
to
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
government
as
--
i
assume,
might
have
more
power
even
conceivably
constitutional,
to
determine
relationship
of
employees
to
it
would
have
to
determine
what
relationship
must
be
used
between
united
stated
steel
corporation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
its
employees.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

--
deny
of
access
to
where
they're
working,
denied
on
the
right
to
work.
i'm
talking
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
different
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
mr.
dunau
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
suppose
the
employer
instead
of
saying
that,
had
without
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
government,
called
her
in
and
says,
"i'm
discharging
you.
i
thought,
i'm
afraid
of
you
for
security
reasons
i
don't
want
you
around
me."
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
government
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
--
have
you
considered
that
phrase
as
a
different
constitutional
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
talking
about
the
employer.
would
you
think
it
raised
any
constitutional
question
at
all
with
reference
to
the
employer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you're
going
on
the
basis
here
and
when
the
government
--
the
government
moves
against
somebody
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
do
something
to
them,
working
for
a
private
employer
or
not
working
for
them,
but
the
due
process
clause
requires
us
to
go
through
certain
procedure.
