justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
length
of
service
make
a
difference?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
if
a
person
loses
a
job,
even
if
she's
been
there
six
and
a
half
weeks.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
constant,
she
would've
lost
if
she
had
been
transferred
to
another
place?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
we
have
to
see
all
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
to
her
employer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
we
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
the
contractor,
who
hires
out
for
this
kind
of
thing,
has
a
special
seniority
agreement
as
compared
with
other
places
here
before?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
take
judicial
notice
of
all
these
--
of
all
these
matters
as
a
matter
of
common
law
of
trade
union
law.
i'm
further
suggesting
if
either
irrelevancy,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
record
disclose
the
nature
of
the
agreement
between
the
government
and
the
contractor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
wasn't
referring
to
that.
i
was
referring
to
the
arrangement
between
the
government
and
the
contractor
as
to
his
rights
to
continue
to
be
a
contractor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
suppose
the
commander
in
chief
this
afternoon,
jots
down
his
cafeteria
with
the
confession
there
that
sue
for
frustration
of
the
contract?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
commander
in
chief
not
the
commanding
officer.
the
president
of
the
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
no
i
mean
he
shuts
to
the
factory.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
that
provision
would
come
into
play?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
if
the
president
as
the
commander
in
chief,
who
deems
it
appropriate
to
shut
that
factory,
if
it's
sued
for
loss
of
profit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
decide
that,
but
i
might
not
so
sure
you're
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
neither
do
i,
but
it
all
depends
what
the
agreement
is,
what
its
implications
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
correctly
right
really
has
something
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
does
so
because
of
the
special
nature,
the
claimed
nature
of
a
--
of
a
service
post
to
actually
right
to
involve
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
against
the
federal
overriding
authority.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
only
surprised
when
people
resort
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
case
like
that
and
the
case
like
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
think,
most
talk
about
due
process
argued
deep
an
open
door,
namely,
whether
there're
some
human
interests
involved.
you've
to
go
on
and
say,
"is
it
--
is
it
depravation
of
due
process."
and
that's
why
i
--
myself,
truax
in
right,
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
but
what
else
you
can
--
a
man
can
come
in
and
--
in
from
the
street
and
say,
"i
think
that
arizona
statute,"
if
it
was
arizona,
was
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
arizona
statute
offends
the
national
interest
of
immigration,
etcetera.
he
can't
do
that,
he's
got
to
have
some
--
he's
got
to
have
a
lawsuit
and
nobody
questions
that
a
fellow
on
can't
--
isn't
allowed
to
work
--
isn't
allowed
to
work.
the
question
is
whether
there
are
some
justifications
and
all
that
chief
justice
hughes,
if
it
was
hughes,
who
wrote
that
opinion,
said
it's
just
to
tell
the
facts.
but
the
real
question
was
whether
you
can
justify
it.
and
so
here,
if
a
person
is
deprived
of
any
kind
of
a
job,
whether
of
the
justice
of
the
supreme
court
or
a
lawyer
or
cook
is
deprived
of
something.
but
the
question
is,
is
she
deprived
of
it,
without
due
process
of
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
talking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
they
do
say.
they
--
they
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
become
a
military
reservation,
it's
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
we'll
let
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
not
take
your
time,
mr.
dunau
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
we'll
listen
to
mr.
davis
and
he'll
tell
us
what
it
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
a
good
thing
for
both
lawyers
and
judges
to
contain
that
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
applied
for
a
government
job,
any
questionnaire
that
she
would
have
to
fill
out
what
rubric,
what
item
of
--
of
a
question,
which
she
have
to
respond
for
another
to
disclosure
this
burden.
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
what
you
regard
as
in
the
regulations
or
provisions
under
which
the
commanding
officer
would
--
would
be
authorized
to
act
with
a
mere
busy
body
of
persons
having
a
perfectly
neutral
job
with
being
a
busy
body
and
sticking
his
--
his
(inaudible).
would
he
be
empowered
to
discharge
those,
so
you
can't
stick
--
stick
around
here
anymore.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
mr.
davis,
do
you
deny
that
in
fact,
they
were
some
inroad
upon
her
previous
freedom
of
action
and
enjoyment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
very
well
then,
then
why
do
we
fiddle
around
with
these
peripheral
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
read
that
judge
prettyman
correctly
stated
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
why
couldn't
you
address
yourself
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
--
suggestion
is
that
--
and
i
don't
know
anything
about
it,
except
what
i'm
told
that
i
could
even
--
the
suggestion
is
that
the
inference
on
which
you
rely
on
the
practices
--
the
practice
which
you
draw
from
them
only
--
only
relates
to
casual
visitors
like
myself
going
in
there
and
the
guard
stops
me
and
the
commandant
or
the
commanding
officer-in-charge
can
say,
"we
let
him
in
or
not
let
him
in."
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
people
who
have
a
status,
that
it
were
on
the
--
on
the
premises
of
the
illustration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
somebody
might
pick
you
up
on
not
attached
to
it
by
law
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
say
mr.
brawner
was
attached
to
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
by
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
a
practical
term.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
in
mcelroy,
mr.
davis,
the
decision
of
the
court,
i'm
saying
the
decision,
i'm
not
--
i'm
mindful
of
things
that
were
in
the
decision
or
some
of
the
concerns
that
led
to
a
construction
that
he
made,
but
the
decision
of
the
court.
i
think
i'm
going
to
speak
with
accuracy
when
i
say
that
there
wasn't
a
procedure
authorizing
the
discharge
or
dismiss
or
whatever
you
call
it.
now,
in
this
case,
if
you
--
if
you
--
if
the
government
makes
out
of
case
that
there
was
an
authorized
procedure,
can
you
reach
the
question
which
--
which
envelops
that
to
mcelroy
case
namely,
whether
that's
constitutionally
permissible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
think
suggest
that
considering
we
have
the
limited
time
we
have
and
those
large
issues
do
not
rest
the
last
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
got
to
satisfy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
got
to
get
by
greene,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
started
to
say
that
in
addition
to
--
to
the
exhibit
to
which
justice
harlan
called
attention,
exhibit
f
that
you
go
beyond
that
in
--
in
getting
by
greene
in
your
phrase.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
establishing
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
historically,
how
far
facts
have
they
ran?
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
manuals.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
mean,
what's
the
originating
point,
the
date
of
origin,
how
far
back
to
they
ran?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
--
are
they
printed
in
to
register,
the
federal
register?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
they
public
documents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
they
are
in
libraries?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
say
that
the
--
that
they
derived
from,
at
least
in
principally,
they
derived
from
the
fact
that
which
you've
given
us
one
opinion
of
the
attorney
general,
going
back
1837.
they
derived
from
the
assumption
that
there
is
this
power
of
the
commandant
or
the
commanding
officer
to
control
who
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
goes
about
the
installation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
suppose
of
our
civil
service
act
is
constitutionally
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
the
original
one.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
--
when
they
got
--
didn't
get
busy
on
this,
didn't
begin
until
the
1980s.
i
mean
suppose
that
they
suddenly
discovered
in
the
1980s
that
we
must
have
a
civil
service
act
because
the
constitution
required
that
you
can't
fire
anybody
for
no
reason
at
all,
in
the
government
service.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
first
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

something
--
