mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
can
be
put
in
quick
focus.
a
civilian,
non-governmental
employee
works
as
a
short-order
cook
at
a
cafeteria
located
on
the
premises
of
the
gun
factory.
she
works
for
a
civilian,
non-governmental
employer
who
operates
the
cafeteria
pursuant
to
a
contract
with
the
gun
factory.
the
superintendent
of
the
gun
factory
and
his
security
officer
calls
the
short-order
cook
to
lose
her
job
because
she
allegedly
fails
to
meet
security
requirements.
there
is
no
disclosure
of
what
the
security
requirements
constitute.
there
is
no
statement
of
reasons
particularizing
the
respects
in
which
the
employee
allegedly
fails
to
meet
them.
and
there
is
no
hearing
of
any
kind
at
which
to
know
or
meet
the
evidence
supporting
the
bare
conclusion.
our
question
is
whether
such
action
by
governmental
officers
is
authorized
and
if
authorized,
whether
it
is
constitutional.
what
happened
here?
on
november
15th,
1956,
the
employer
operated
three
main
cafeterias
on
the
premises
of
the
naval
gun
factory,
government
land.
he
operated
those
cafeterias
pursuant
to
an
agreement
with
the
board
of
governors
of
the
naval
gun
factory
cafeterias,
a
group
of
seven
civilian
governmental
employees
appointed
by
the
superintendent.
one
of
the
provisions
of
that
agreement
said
this,
"in
no
event
shall
the
concessionaire
engage
or
continue
to
engage
for
operations
under
this
agreement,
personnel
who
failed
to
meet
the
security
requirements
or
other
requirements
under
applicable
regulations
of
the
activity,
as
determined
by
the
security
officer
of
the
activity."
the
employees
working
at
those
cafeterias
were
represented
by
the
petitioner
union
in
collective
bargaining.
the
union
had
been
certified
as
the
exclusive
representative
in
1942
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
collective
bargaining
agreements
have
entered
ever
--
into
ever
since.
each
collective
bargaining
agreement
contained
the
provision
that
no
employee
shall
be
suspended
or
discharged
without
good
and
sufficient
cause.
on
november
15th,
1956,
one
of
the
employees
working
there
was
a
person
named
rachel
brawner,
who
worked
as
a
short-order
cook.
she
had
worked
at
that
shop
--
at
that
cafeteria
for
six
and
one-half
years.
she
was
a
first-rate
employee
whose
performance
of
work
was
never
questioned
as
being
altogether
satisfactory.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
think
it
makes
a
difference,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
suggestion
that
she
has
not
been
injured
on
the
loss
of
his
job.
i
think
that
when
a
person
has
had
a
job
for
six
and
a
half
years,
it
goes
a
rather
a
long
way
to
say
that
the
loss
of
that
job
is
not
an
injury.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
go
along
entirely
with
that
and
go
further
to
say
a
person
who's
been
denied
an
opportunity
to
get
a
job
has
also
been
injured
as
well
as
the
person
who
has
lost
a
job.
mr.
bernard
dunau
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
by
virtue
of
seniority,
she
would
have
priority
over
those
below
her
in
terms
of
layoff,
at
least.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
she
had
been
transferred
to
other
cafeterias
on
the
naval
gun
factory,
of
course,
she
would
still
retain
her
seniority
because
the
agreement
covered
all
operations.
if
she
would
be
transferred
to
any
other
establishment
which
this
employer
operated,
she
would
lose
her
seniority.
there
were
no
collective
bargaining
agreements
protecting
that
seniority
in
other
respects.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
wouldn't
make
a
bit
of
difference,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
i
--
and
that's
--
i
think
it
wouldn't
make
any
--
any
difference
because
even
if
the
place
to
which
the
employee
went
had
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
in
that
place,
that
employee
would
be
a
new
employee.
she
could
not
take
her
seniority
under
one
unit
and
transfer
it
and
get
it
under
another
unit
in
the
absence
of
very
special
circumstances.
mr.
bernard
dunau
very
well,
sir.
on
november
15th,
1956,
as
i
said,
she
was
working
as
a
short-order
cook.
the
day
before,
the
secretary
treasurer
of
the
board
of
governors
notified
a
mr.
baker,
who
was
the
supervisor
of
the
cafeteria
employees
and
he
told
mr.
baker
that
you
have
--
you're
going
to
have
to
pick
up
the
identification
badge
of
rachel
brawner,
the
security
officer
has
told
her
she
is
a
security
risk
and
she
--
and
he
requires
that
her
badge
be
surrendered.
the
next
day,
rachel
brawner
was
relieved
from
her
job
at
the
cafeteria
and
she
reported
to
the
office
of
mr.
baker
and
in
her
words,
this
is
what
happened
at
that
office.
as
i
read
from
page
7
of
our
brief.
"well,
when
i
first
went
in,
i
sat
down
and
mr.
baker
told
me
that
he
was
sorry,
that
he
hasn't
told
to
pick
up
my
badge
and
i
asked
mr.
baker
what
for?"
and
he
said,
"for
security
reasons."
i
said,
"what
about
security?
i
haven't
did
anything.
i
don't
know
anything
that
i
did."
and
he
said,
"that's
all
i
know,
to
pick
your
badge."
i
said,
"what
must
i
do
or
who
do
i
see?"
he
said,
"write
a
letter
to
the
superintendent
of
the
yard."
if
he
were
me,
he
would
write
a
letter
to
the
superintendent.
i
turned
my
badge
over
to
mr.
baker
and
he
asked
the
clerk
to
write
me
a
slip
of
paper
to
get
out
of
the
gate
so
that
i
could
show
it
to
the
marine
on
the
gate."
and
this
is
what
mr.
baker
said,
naturally,
it
upset
her
a
great
deal.
i
could
not
tell
her
anything
except
i
had
been
directed
to
take
such
an
action.
i
tried
to
explain
to
her
the
several
steps
which
i
thought
might
be
possible
for
her
to
follow,
including
going
to
the
security
officer
himself
and
to
the
superintendent
and
of
course,
i
told
her
to
see
mr.
palmer,
her
business
agent.
she
surrendered
her
badge.
she
left
the
premises.
she
has
not
worked
for
the
company
since.
a
badge
is
required
in
order
to
secure
entrance
to
and
exit
from
the
naval
gun
factory
grounds.
this
employee
had
no
access
to
classified
information.
we
deal
with
an
employee
here
who
has
no
access
to
classified
information.
she
immediately
went
to
her
business
agent
and
reported
to
him
what
had
transpired.
in
a
personal
meetings
in
correspondence,
the
union
protested
to
the
employer
that
her
discharge
was
--
was
without
good
and
sufficient
cause.
repeatedly,
he
asked
for
an
explanation
of
the
reason
why
her
security
status
was
thought
to
be
in
question
and
repeatedly,
the
company
said,
"we
do
not
know.
we
cannot
find
out
why
her
security
status
is
thought
to
be
in
question."
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
--
and
i
don't
recall
that
the
record
shows
one
way
or
another.
in
connection
with
the
union's
request
for
an
explanation,
the
employer
attempted
to
arrange
a
meeting
with
the
superintendent
to
discuss
this
question,
but
the
superintendent
refused
to
meet.
he
said,
we
have
made
our
determination,
it
is
a
proper
determination
and
these
are
his
exact
words,
"the
meeting
proposed
would
serve
no
useful
purpose
and
is
therefore
unnecessary.
"and
so
we
have
a
case
in
which
governmental
officers
deprived
a
private
employee
of
her
private
employment
on
the
basis
of
an
alleged
failure
to
meet
security
requirements
and
nobody
knows
what
the
security
requirements
constitute,
how
she
failed
to
meet
them
or
whatever
there
--
there
is
to
support
that
conclusion.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
different,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
private
employee
of
a
private
employer.
the
government
in
that
situation
is
an
outsider.
if
the
government
wishes
to
interfere
with
the
employment
of
a
private
employee,
of
a
private
employer,
it
must
show
justification.
and
if
it
causes
a
discharge
without
any
explanation
at
all,
it
has
shown
no
justification.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir,
it
could.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
sightseer
who
wants
to
go
into
the
grounds
in
order
to
satisfy
his
curiosity.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
person
who
has
an
interest
by
virtue
of
employment
on
those
grounds,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
denial
of
employment
on
the
basis
of
a
reason
given,
impairs
her
opportunity
for
employment
elsewhere
and
we
are
dealing
with
a
person
who
when
found
to
be
a
security
risk,
has
a
reputation
(inaudible)
and
in
deal
with
such
a
person
who
has
these
interests
and
has
those
interests
invaded,
we
are
dealing
with
very
different
kind
of
a
person
than
one
who
is
a
sightseer
or
one
who
--
to
satisfy
his
curiosity,
simply
wishes
to
get
on
the
grounds.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
the
record
--
the
original
record
which
is
before
this
court
has
that
agreement
in
full.
the
printed
record
contains
that
part
of
the
agreement
which
i
believe
is
relevant
to
this
case.
that
part
of
it
which
i
read
said,
"in
no
event
shall
the
concessionaire
engage
or
continue
to
engage
for
operations
under
this
agreement,
personnel
who
fail
to
meet
the
security
requirements
or
other
requirements
under
applicable
regulations
of
the
activity."
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
believe
the
contract
was
terminable
on
60
days
notice
by
either
party.
i
believe
under
the
contract,
the
concessionaire
--
well,
here
--
i
have
it
here,
"this
agreement
shall
continue
for
a
period
of
one
year
from
the
effective
date
herein.
unless
notice
in
writing
of
an
intention
not
to
renew
this
agreement
is
given
by
the
concessionaire
to
the
board
or
by
the
board
to
--
on
the
--
to
the
concessionaire
at
least
30
days
before
the
end
of
the
term,
this
agreement
shall
be
extended
automatically
for
another
term
of
one
year."
and
then
it
goes
on,
"this
agreement
may
be
terminated
at
any
time
by
either
party
upon
30
days
notice
to
the
other
in
writing."
and
then
under
disputes,
it
says
this
which
maybe
relevant,
"any
dispute
concerning
a
question
of
fact
arising
between
the
board,
that
is
the
board
of
governors
of
the
naval
gun
factory
cafeterias,
and
the
concessionaire
under
this
agreement,
which
is
not
disposed
of
by
mutual
agreement,
shall
be
decided
by
the
commanding
officer
of
the
activity
who
shall
reduce
his
decision
to
writing
and
mail
or
otherwise
furnish
a
copy
thereof
to
the
concessionaire.
the
decision
of
a
commanding
officer
--
officer
shall
be
final
and
conclusive
unless
fraudulent,
unless
determined
by
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
to
have
in
fraudulent
or
capricious
or
arbitrary
or
so
grossly
erroneous
as
necessarily
to
imply
bad
faith
or
not
supported
by
a
substantial
interest."
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
the
commanding
officer
were
to
decide
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
president
of
the
united
states
were
to
decide
that
on
the
premises
of
the
gun
factory,
there
is
no
point
in
keeping
cafeterias
off
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
--
it's
a
--
he
may
shut
the
factory,
the
claim
under
as
--
the
concessionaire
under
those
terms
as
i
read
this
agreement,
would
be
for
loss
profit
for
a
period
of
30
days
because
of
the
failure
to
give
30
days
notice
in
writing.
we
do
not
claim
that
the
government
cannot
shut
this
factory
down.
but
we
do
claim
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
for
the
30-day
period
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
because
under
this
agreement,
the
30
days
notice
is
required
before
the
agreement
can
be
terminated
and
i
don't
see
that
that
provision
can
be
gained,
say,
simply
because
of
a
decision
to
terminate
them
now.
you
can
terminate
now
and
pay
the
damages
for
the
30
days.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
that
maybe
sir.
i
should
not
suppose
that
the
president
of
the
united
states,
although
he
is
president,
has
the
power
to
abrogate
valid
agreements
without
passing
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
think
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
greene
v.
mcelroy.
the
navy
personnel
instructions
which
we
quote
on
page
30
of
our
brief,
in
which
the
respondents
quote
at
page
29
of
their
brief,
say
this,
"the
services
operated
by
concessionaires
are
classed
as
private
enterprises.
they
acquire
none
of
the
status
of
a
government
instrumentality
and
their
employees
have
the
same
legal
status
as
do
the
employees
of
any
private
employer."
this
court,
in
greene
v.
mcelroy
decided
the
status
of
a
private
employee
of
a
private
employer,
whose
employment
was
adversely
affected
on
security
grounds
by
the
secretary
of
defense
or
his
subordinates.
this
court
held
that
in
the
absence
of
explicit
authorization
for
either
the
president
or
congress,
the
respondents
were
not
empowered
to
deprive
petitioner
of
his
job
in
a
proceeding
in
which
he
was
not
afforded
the
safeguards
of
confrontation
and
cross-examination.
we
have
a
case
therefore,
in
which
an
employee
who
has
access
to
classified
information
and
who
has
been
given
a
limited
hearing,
may
nevertheless
not
have
his
--
lose
his
employment
on
the
basis
of
such
a
limited
hearing.
in
this
case,
we
are
told
that
though
such
an
employee
cannot
lose
his
employment,
an
employee
with
no
access
to
classified
information
and
without
any
hearing
at
all,
may
nevertheless,
lose
her
job
on
security
grounds.
we
think
that
turns
things
upside
down.
there
are
three
distinctions
suggested,
of
course,
the
first
in
greene,
there
was
a
--
no
authority
and
here,
there
was.
the
second,
william
greene
was
an
aeronautical
engineer
and
rachel
brawner
is
a
cook.
william
greene
couldn't
work
as
an
aeronautical
engineer
once
the
security
clearance
was
taken
from
him,
rachel
brawner
can
work
as
a
cook
here
and
everywhere.
william
greene
worked
on
private
property.
rachel
waner
--
brawner
worked
on
government
property.
let's
look
at
the
distinctions,
let's
take
authority
first.
in
greene,
there
was
at
least
explicit
departmental
authority
for
the
action
taken.
in
this
case,
there
is
not
even
departmental
authority
shown.
now,
an
oral
argument
is
no
place
for
the
meticulous
tracing
of
regulations,
but
i
want
to
make
only
two
points
with
respect
to
the
lack
of
even
departmental
authority
for
the
action
taken.
respondents
agreed
that
if
rachel
brawner,
working
on
the
premises
of
the
gun
factory,
had
had
access
to
classified
information,
she
would
at
least,
have
gotten
the
limited
hearing
under
the
regulation
which
this
court
invalidated
in
greene
v.
mcelroy.
yet,
they
say
she
is
not
entitled
to
even
this
limited
hearing
because
she
has
no
access
to
classified
information.
we
think
this
turn
--
turns
things
upside
down.
a
regulation
which
requires
that
an
employee
with
access
to
classified
information
be
given
at
least
a
limited
hearing,
cannot
conceivably
be
read
to
authorize
no
hearing
as
to
an
employee
with
no
access
to
classified
information.
we
think
the
inference
from
the
departmental
regulation
itself
is
that
such
employees
are
to
be
let
alone
and
they
are
to
be
let
alone
for
the
very
good
reason
that
they
have
no
access
to
classified
information.
and
we
are
told,
however,
that
throughout
the
history
of
this
country,
military
commanders
have
done
as
they
please
with
respect
to
civilian
presence
on
governmental
land
and
departmental
usage
is
therefore,
the
basis
for
our
departmental
authority.
the
most
i
get
from
the
showing
is
that
military
personnel
have
told
each
other
so
often
that
they
can
do
as
they
please
with
respect
to
civilian
presence
on
governmental
land
that
they
have
to
come
to
believe
it
must
be
so.
but
even
what
they
show
does
not
in
the
least
relate
to
security
clearance
and
as
the
denial
of
a
job
on
that
basis
and
it
could
not,
because
security
clearance
and
the
denial
of
a
job
on
that
basis
is
a
relatively
recent
invention.
there
is
no
history
to
appeal
to
with
respect
to
that
question.
but
interestingly
enough,
respondents'
own
showing
indicates
that
an
insurance
salesman
who
solicits
business
on
a
military
post
cannot
be
excluded
from
that
post
without
being
given
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
an
insurance
company
cannot
have
its
representatives
excluded
from
the
post
on
the
basis
of
misconduct
of
the
representatives
without
giving
the
insurance
company
an
opportunity
to
explain.
well,
if
insurance
salesmen
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
insurance
companies
an
opportunity
to
explain,
i
can
hardly
imagine
the
existence
of
departmental
authority
by
which
private
employees
may
lose
their
jobs
and
be
stigmatized
their
security
risks
without
any
hearing
at
all
and
with
no
chance
to
explain.
mr.
bernard
dunau
those
are
under
the
regulations,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
relied
upon
by
the
government.
i
did
not
know
of
their
existence
until
i
read
the
government's
brief
and
gather
that
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
these
are
formal
army
regulations,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
appear
at
page
53,
note
32
of
the
government's
brief.
actually
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
do
not
know
whether
these
particular
regulations
were
enforced
at
the
time
of
the
discharge.
well,
maybe
i
do
know.
the
--
no,
sir,
i
do
not
know.
actually,
the
existence
of
departmental
authority
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
not
that
i
know
about,
your
honor.
there
are
maybe
but
--
i
do
not
know.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
this
would
be
applicable
only
to
army
installations,
but
the
case
here
obviously
is
not
confined
to
what
naval
commanders
can
do
but
--
and
something
different
from
what
army
commanders
can
do.
actually,
the
existence
of
departmental
authority
in
this
case,
is
almost
a
side
issue.
because
even
if
they
were
departmental
authority,
it
would
make
no
difference
in
the
absence
of
explicit
authorization
for
that
action
either
from
the
president
or
from
congress,
this
is
what
this
court
said
in
greene
v.
mcelroy."
no
presidential
authority
is
claimed
or
exists
on
the
contrary."
since
this
court's
decision
in
greene
v.
mcelroy
in
february
of
this
year,
an
executive
order
was
promulgated
authorizing
the
establishment
of
a
security
program.
and
under
that
executive
order,
a
limited
hearing
is
afforded
to
employees
including
a
limited
opportunity
for
cross-examination.
now,
we
can
hardly
believe
that
when
the
president
authorizes
or
requires
a
limited
hearing
and
a
limited
opportunity
for
cross-examination
on
behalf
of
employees
whose
--
who
do
have
access
to
classified
information,
then
he
could
possibly
be
have
--
have
said
to
have
authorized
no
hearing
at
all,
with
respect
of
an
employee
who
has
no
access
to
classified
information.
there's,
of
course,
no
congressional
authority.
the
most
that
respondent
showed
by
way
of
statutory
authority
is
that
when
military
establishments
have
been
authorized
to
run
a
military
establishment
and
they
have
been
authorized
to
promulgate
regulations
to
run
that
establishment.
this
much
and
much
more
that
is
present
in
greene
v.
mcelroy,
it
didn't
suffice
there
and
it
cannot
suffice
here.
let's
go
to
the
question
that
this
case
is
different
because
greene
was
an
aeronautical
engineer
and
rachel
brawner
is
a
cook.
greene
could
not
work
as
an
aeronautical
engineer.
rachel
brawner
can
work
as
a
cook
here
and
everywhere.
45
years
ago,
in
truax
v.
raich,
this
court
protected
the
job
of
a
man
called
mike
raich
who
worked
as
a
cook
in
a
restaurant
in
arizona.
of
his
employment
as
a
cook
in
a
restaurant
in
arizona,
this
court
said,
"it
needs
no
argument
that
the
work
in
the
common
occupations
of
the
community
is
of
the
essence
of
personal
freedom
and
opportunity."
and
it
also
said
that
though
mike
raich's
employment
was
at
the
will
--
at
will,
it
was
at
the
will
of
his
employer,
not
at
the
will
of
somebody
else.
rachel
brawner
is
in
a
fortiori
position.
her
employment
is
not
an
employment
at
will.
her
employment
was
safeguarded
by
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
said,
"she
shall
not
be
suspended
or
discharged
without
good
and
sufficient
cause."
mr.
bernard
dunau
to
the
extent
that
the
government
claims
and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
what
it
injures
this
whole
case
on
that
her
job
--
the
protection
of
her
job,
was
not
an
interest
which
would
bring
into
play
due
process
or
the
right
to
be
free
from
unauthorized
action,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
do
not
seem
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
we
are
talking
about
a
protectable
right
and
injury,
the
job
is
the
protected
right,
the
job
has
been
injured.
if
we
talk
about
the
question
that
this
job
was
located
on
federal
land,
we
are
no
longer
talking
about
whether
there
is
an
interest
you
can
protect,
we
are
talking
about
whether
the
government
has
justification
for
invading
that
interest,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
different
question.
and
on
the
question
of
the
interest,
it
seems
to
me
that
truax
v.
raich
is
pertinent.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
seems
to
me,
when
they
start
talking
about
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
exactly
what
they're
saying.
i
cannot
read
it
anymore
plainly
than
that.
they
say
when
they
begin
their
constitutional
argument
on
page
57,
the
interest
of
a
private
person
in
having
access
to
a
military
base
in
order
to
be
able
to
work
there
for
a
private
employer
is
not
liberty
or
property
entitled
to
procedural
due
process
protections.
so,
i
--
i
take
it
that
they
have
to
agree
that
what
william
greene
had
was
liberty
or
property,
otherwise,
this
court
would
never
had
a
grave
constitutional
question
to
avoid,
but
what
was
liberty
or
property
to
william
greene,
is
not
liberty
or
property
to
rachel
brawner.
and
that
has
to
come
down
to
a
distinction
that
rachel
brawner
was
a
cook
and
william
greene
was
an
engineer
and
perhaps
an
additional
distinction
that
rachel
brawner
worked
on
governmental
property,
william
greene
worked
on
private
property.
mr.
bernard
dunau
(voice
overlap)
--
questions
which
i'd
like
to
get
to.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
it
seems
to
me
to
go
to
an
entirely
different
point.
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
it
was.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
quite
agree
with
your
analysis,
your
--
your
honor.
it's
respondents
who
disagree
with
it.
i
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
agree
that
there
was
light,
that
there
was
liberty
or
property
taken.
respondents
cannot
agree
to
that
because
they
cannot
for
a
minute,
claim
that
it
was
taken
with
due
process
of
law.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
they
didn't
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
they
do
not
say
that.
mr.
bernard
dunau
they
spend
(voice
overlap)
30
pages
of
their
brief
not
saying
that.
mr.
bernard
dunau
very
well.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
i'll
try
to
read
that
brief
very
clearly
because
i
could
hardly
contain
my
amazement
when
i
read
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
even
if
--
even
if
in
this
case,
all
that
rachel
brawner
had
lost
towards
this
particular
job
at
that
cafeteria
which
she
had
held
for
six
and
one-half
years,
it
would
be
injury
enough.
this
much
at
least,
this
court
decided
in
peters
against
hobby.
dr.
peters
worked
for
the
government
for
four
to
six
day
--
4
to
10
days
a
year
on
a
per
diem
basis.
he
was
a
fulltime
professor
of
medicine
at
the
yale
university
medical
school.
his
four
to
six
days
was
enough
of
an
interest
for
him
to
protest
his
debarment
from
federal
employment
on
loyalty
grounds.
if
his
four
to
six
days
employment
in
an
annual
period
is
enough,
we
can
hardly
imagine
why
a
cook's
employment
for
one
year,
is
not
enough.
actually,
if
rachel
brawner
has
the
next
day
gotten
an
entirely
comparable
job,
she
would
still
have
suffered
a
permanent
injury,
economic
injury.
because
however
comparable
that
other
job
may
be,
she
must
start
at
it
with
zero
seniority.
she
must
give
up
six
and
one-half
years
of
seniority
and
not
withstanding
all
the
limitations
on
judicial
notice.
i
think
in
the
year
1961,
one
can
recognize
that
six
and
one-half
years
of
seniority
is
a
valuable
economic
benefit.
but
she
--
her
loss
even
in
economic
terms
was
not
confined
to
the
loss
of
that
shop
or
its
purposes.
her
opportunity
for
employment
was
generally
impaired.
this
union
represents
2600
employees
in
the
district
of
columbia.
2000
of
them
worked
in
governmental
cafeterias.
those
2000
jobs
are
closed
to
rachel
brawner.
she
cannot
work
as
a
short-order
cook
in
any
cafeteria
located
in
any
governmental
building.
let
me
read
what
the
business
agent
said
about
that.
an
employee,
i
read
from
page
91
of
our
brief,
who
may
be
discharged
as
a
security
risk
has
not
a
ghost
of
a
chance
of
getting
a
job
in
a
government
cafeteria
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
obtain
employment
for
any
employee
who
has
that
tag
on
them
in
any
cafeteria.
if
the
actual
extent
of
the
injury
were
material,
a
trial
would
show
that
rachel
brawner
in
the
last
four
years
has
been
able
to
work
only
half
of
the
full
time
available
to
her.
in
the
six
and
one-half
years
preceding
that,
she
worked
fulltime.
now,
an
injury
which
results
in
depriving
an
employee
of
half
of
the
income
he
would
otherwise
have
gotten
seems
to
me
to
be
injury
enough.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
it
did
not.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
no
public
statement
issued.
the
--
they
make
an
--
an
argument
based
on
it,
but
to
say,
if
only
she
had
kept
her
mouth
shut,
no
one
would've
known
that
she
was
deprived
of
this
--
that
she
has
been
discharged
as
a
security
risk.
and
they
say,
"the
only
reason
that
was
ever
published
or
publicized
is
that
she
sought
to
protect
her
interests."
and
so
presumably,
we
should
not
have
began
a
lawsuit
in
order
to
protect
her
interest
because,
by
that
means,
the
community
would
not
have
known
that
she
had
been
discharged
as
a
security
risk.
we
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
jobs
which
circuit
judges
think
are
--
are
available
here
and
everywhere
for
short-order
cooks,
are
somewhat
more
difficult
for
business
agents
of
unions
to
find.
and
the
tag
on
the
employee
that
she
was
a
security
risk
is
itself,
an
injury.
the
community
does
not
distinguish
between
loyalty
and
security.
if
an
employee
has
that
talk
--
tag
on
him,
he
has
been
hurt
and
that's
annoying
wrong.
we're
told
two
things,
however,
on
the
question
of
injury.
we're
told,
"well,
the
employer,
after
he
discharged
her,
offered
her
employment
at
another
place
he
operated
in
virginia."
what
difference
does
that
make?
would
this
case
be
different
if
the
employer
had
no
other
place
that
he
was
running?
would
this
case
be
different
if
though
he
had
another
place,
he
didn't
choose
to
give
her
employment
there?
and
in
any
event,
she
didn't
take
that
other
job,
the
record
shows,
because
it
was
an
unsatisfactory
location.
and
if
it
were
material,
we
could
show
conclusively
that
it
has
been
satisfactory.
to
the
extent
that
public
transportation
is
even
available
to
that
job,
it
takes
three
hours
to
get
to
and
from
work.
it
takes
a
$1.60
in
transportation
fare
to
get
to
and
from
their
job.
if
she
were
earning
the
same
rate
of
pay
at
that
new
place
that
she
had
at
the
old
place,
she
was
getting
a
$1.18
an
hour.
we
don't
think
a
satisfactory
job
is
one
which
it
takes
three
hours
to
get
to
and
from
and
which
takes
17%
of
your
income.
we
have
another
curious
distinction
that
is
suggested.
the
same
employer
no
longer
operates
the
cafeterias
as
to
what
operated
them
at
the
time
of
her
discharge.
there
is
now
a
new
concessionaire.
this
new
concessionaire
has
agreed,
has
promised
to
put
rachel
brawner
back
to
work
with
full
seniority
rights,
but
this
doesn't
make
any
difference.
she
is
still
now
in
the
position
of
trying
to
get
a
new
job.
she's
not
trying
to
protect
her
old
job.
well,
there's
nothing
new
about
the
job.
his
job
is
still
the
same
old
job.
the
only
thing
that's
new
is
the
corporate
employing
entity.
and
even
if
it
were
true
that
even
analytically,
one
could
say
she's
trying
to
get
a
new
job,
not
retaining
her
old
job,
we,
like
the
ninth
circuit,
think
that
although
employment
of
which
plaintiffs
were
deprived,
was
prospective
only
if
their
rights
to
earn
a
livelihood
like
that
in
truax
v.
raich
was
entitled
to
protection
at
the
hands
of
a
court
of
equity.
we
think
that
getting
a
job
is
as
important
as
keeping
a
job.
so
we
get
to
the
last
distinction.
this
was
governmental
land.
william
greene
worked
on
private
property.
on
this
premise,
had
william
greene
worked
as
an
aeronautical
engineer
of
the
premises
of
the
naval
gun
factory,
he
could've
lost
his
job,
his
employment
opportunities
could've
been
destroyed,
his
reputation
could've
been
besmirched
not
on
the
basis
of
a
limited
hearing,
but
with
no
hearing
at
all
and
why?
because
he
worked
on
governmental
premises.
i
had
not
understood
that
just
because
the
act
takes
place
on
governmental
land,
that
a
governmental
officer
may
act
without
authority
and
i
had
not
understood
that
the
constitution
stops
at
the
entrance
to
a
naval
installation.
if
the
issue
of
governmental
land
were
indeed
relevant,
that
would
have
been
the
short
answer
to
a
long
line
of
cases
which
state
and
federal
governments
have
lost
when
public
employees
sought
to
regain
their
jobs
which
they
had
lost
because
of
failure
to
meet
so-called
security
requirements.
the
federal
employees
who
lost
their
jobs
because
the
governmental
officers
exceeded
their
authority
could
have
been
--
could
have
been
told,
"you
work
on
government
--
worked
in
governmental
buildings,
we
can
keep
anybody
out
of
a
governmental
building
we
choose.
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
labor
view
has
a
security
risk
without
any
authority."
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir.
not
in
terms
of
the
issue
presented
by
this
case,
your
honor.
i
think
there
maybe
a
distinction
in
this
sense
only.
if
it's
a
military
installation
and
if
there
are
secrets
available
in
that
installation,
i
think
the
government
is
entitled
to
set
up
a
security
program
which
provides
persons
with
an
adequate
opportunity
to
defend.
i
think
that
may
not
be
true
where
you
have
a
governmental
building
in
which
there
is
no
access
to
classified
information.
but
i
can
conceive
it
to
be
relevant
only
in
terms
of
protection
of
classified
information,
but
i
cannot
conceive
that
whether
it
is
a
governmental
building
like
the
national
labor
relations
board
occupies
or
the
naval
gun
factory
that
the
military
occupies
that
on
the
issue
of
authority
to
act
in
the
first
place
or
constitutional
authority
to
act
if
we
get
to
that,
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
military
land
as
distinguished
from
other
land
can
make
a
difference.
mr.
bernard
dunau
again,
the
only
--
well,
you
don't
throw
people
overboard
presumably
if
he's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
you
can't
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
let
me
make
this
clear
at
the
beginning.
the
commanding
officer
can
tell
any
civilian
to
get
off
a
ship,
to
get
off
his
property,
to
stay
off.
what
he
cannot
do
and
what
was
done
here
is
to
tell
him
that
and
not
render
the
hearing
on
the
question
of
the
reason
why
he's
kept
off.
we
do
not
deny
the
power
of
summary
suspension
so
long
as
thereafter,
the
employee
has
an
opportunity
to
have
a
hearing
at
which
he
can
defend
against
the
charges
and
if
the
charges
are
not
substantiated
to
have
a
compensation
for
his
lost
time.
what
the
government
wants
is
to
recognize
all
the
interest
on
is
--
on
its
side
and
no
interest
on
the
other,
wants
to
subjugate
the
employees'
interest.
i
think
that's
not
permissible.
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
of
whether
the
government's
ownership
of
the
land
makes
a
difference.
if
secrets
are
added
to
government
ownership
of
land,
it
still
makes
no
difference,
because
there
are
as
many
secrets
in
private
factories
and
laboratories
as
there
are
in
governmental
factories
and
laboratories.
the
security
dangers
are
no
different
if
the
navy
builds
a
submarine
in
the
brooklyn
navy
yard
or
has
it
built
by
the
general
dynamics
corporation.
secrecy
cannot
distinguish
what
happens
off
military
bases
and
what
happens
on
military
bases.
and
if
secrecy
cannot
make
the
difference,
government
ownership
of
the
land
alone,
cannot
be
the
difference.
and
when
one
invokes
secrecy
in
this
case,
it's
a
terrifyingly
ironic
thing,
because
we
are
talking
about
secrecy
in
a
case
where
the
employee
who
has
been
discharged
is
a
short-order
cook
who
has
no
access
to
classified
information.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
--
at
best,
there
is
no
issue
of
secrecy
in
this
case,
because
the
government's
interest
in
protecting
military
secrets
can
be
preserved
consistently
with
preserving
the
individuals
interest
in
a
hearing
before
he
is
discharged
and
stigmatized
as
a
security
risk.
nothing
prevents
summary
exclusion
of
any
employee
from
a
military
base
or
from
any
place
else,
pending
a
hearing
on
the
charges
against
him
with
compensation
for
the
lost
time,
if
the
charges
are
not
shown
to
be
substantiated.
that
gives
the
government
all
it
needs
to
protect
its
interest
in
secrecy
and
it
gives
the
employee,
the
individual,
what
he
needs
to
protect
his
interests
against
unconstitutional
or
arbitrary
action.
what
this
case
then
comes
down
to
in
terms
of
ownership
of
land,
it
seems
to
us,
as
the
government
says,
“it's
the
landlord”.
well,
being
the
landlord
does
not
permit
a
governmental
officer
to
act
without
authority
or
to
act
unconstitutionally.
being
the
landlord
does
not
privilege
depriving
an
employee
of
his
job
and
stigmatizing
him
on
the
basis
of
no
hearing
at
all.
being
the
landlord
is
just
irrelevant
to
the
invasion
of
the
interests,
which
are
here
asserted.
i
think
we
are
right
that
on
the
basis
of
greene
v.
mcelroy,
this
case
must
be
reversed
without
reaching
any
constitutional
questions.
but
if
this
action
in
this
case
be
authorized,
we
then
have
to
face
the
first
amendment
and
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
the
government's
argument
--
the
respondent's
argument,
as
i
understand
it
under
the
fifth
amendment,
is
that
nothing
was
taken
from
rachel
brawner
which
constitutes
liberty
or
property.
but
clearly
she
had
a
job,
she
had
employment
opportunities,
she
had
a
reputation.
these
were
protectable
interests,
these
are
liberty
or
property.
clearly,
these
were
invaded
and
so
it
seems
to
me,
the
only
question
that
can
exist
is
where
they
invaded
without
due
process
of
law.
in
this
case,
there
can
be
no
such
question
because
no
process
cannot
conceivably
be
due
process.
if
we
even
grant
that
there
was
no
liberty
or
property
in
terms
of
the
job
employment
opportunities
or
reputation.
we
have
to
at
least
face
also
the
denial
of
first
amendment
rights.
on
the
issue
of
first
amendment
rights,
the
government
has
one
footnote
in
its
brief
that
tells
us
the
contention
is
plainly
without
substance
at
page
59,
note
35,
and
then
it
says,
"persons
can
without
doubt,
be
excluded
from
military
installations
on
the
basis
of
speech
or
action,
which
maybe
within
the
general
area
of
the
first
amendment,
but
which
raises
a
suspicion
that
the
person
easily
is
or
easily
could
become
a
security
risk
or
even
merely
produces
a
lack
of
confidence
in
the
person."
so
confessedly,
action
adverse
to
the
individual
can
be
taken
on
the
basis
of
the
valid
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights.
now,
if
that
does
not
involve
a
first
amendment
right,
i
do
not
know
how
it
can
be
involved.
and
more
than
that,
the
claim
is
that
a
first
amendment
right,
adverse
action
can
be
taken
upon
the
basis
of
its
exercise,
with
no
hearing
at
all
and
altogether
summary
an
ex
parte
determination.
you
cannot
even
show
that
what
was
thought
to
be
said
was
in
fact,
not
said.
you
cannot
even
show
that
what
was
said,
does
not
reasonably
give
rise
to
a
suspicion
or
to
a
lack
of
confidence.
well,
if
this
is
the
procedure
and
we
are
told
that
this
is
it,
then
it
seems
to
us
that
nobody
can
be
safe
against
condemnation
as
a
security
risk.
he's
not
even
safe
even
then,
unless
he
reads
nothing
except
banalities,
talks
about
nothing
except
anonymities,
associates
with
nobody
about
who
an
eyebrow
can
be
raised.
if
this
does
not
abridged
first
amendment
rights,
we
do
not
know
what
can
and
if
this
can
be
done
without
a
hearing,
we
do
not
know
how
much
more
at
least
by
contemporary
methods,
one
can
bring
governmental
action
into
collision
with
the
first
amendment.
i
close
with
the
questions
that
rachel
brawner
asked,
what
about
security?
i
haven't
did
anything,
i
don't
know
anything
i
did.
what
must
i
do
or
who
do
i
see?
i
do
not
think
that
in
this
country,
rachel
brawner
can
be
turned
away
with
the
answer,
"you
don't
have
to
be
told
about
your
security
when
we
bring
it
in
question.
there
is
nothing
you
can
do.
there
is
nobody
you
can
see."
mr.
bernard
dunau
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
confess
to
some
bewilderment
at
the
notion
that
the
government
in
this
case
did
not
directly
affect
the
job.
under
the
concessionaire
agreement,
the
agreement
provided
that
the
concessionaire
will
not
engage
or
continue
to
engage
an
employee
who
is
found
by
the
security
officer
not
to
meet
security
requirements.
how
much
more
directly
can
a
job
be
affected,
than
by
ordering
the
employee
not
to
continue
to
engage
for
that
employee.
on
the
notion
that
this
employee
has
the
slightest
chance
of
getting
a
job
in
any
government
cafeteria,
every
application
for
employment
must
disclose
your
previous
employer
and
why
you
changed
employment.
now,
if
this
woman
went
to
the
nat
catering
corporation,
which
runs
the
cafeterias
at
the
pentagon
and
said,
"one
of
my
former
employers
was
m
&
m
at
the
gun
factory
and
i
have
to
leave
there,
because
i
did
not
meet
security
requirements."
it
would
be
a
very
lengthy
to
suppose
that
that
employee
would
be
employed
by
the
nat
catering
corporation
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
general
services
incorporated,
which
operates
restaurants
in
all
governmental
facilities.
there
has
been
an
expression
here
that
these
manuals
confer
authority.
we,
in
our
brief
at
length,
show
why
these
manuals
even
departmentally
do
not
confer
any
authority.
for
example,
the
statement
in
those
manuals
that
a
visitor
constitutes
an
employee
who
is
a
contractor
personnel
or
a
contractor's
employee,
that
does
not
refer
to
a
contractor
employee
who
works
on
the
governmental
premises,
that
refers
to
a
contractor
employee
who
works
on
his
own
employers
premises
and
has
occasion
to
visit
a
governmental
installation.
that
is
made
perfectly
clear
it
seems
to
us,
by
the
1958
manual,
which
says
with
respect
to
contractor
employees,
under
the
visitor
classification.
i
read
from
page
50
of
our
brief,
"department
of
defense
contractors
desiring
to
have
an
employee,
visit
an
activity
of
the
naval
establishment
involving
access
to
classified
information,
have
been
instructed
to
address
a
request
in
writing,
directly
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
activity
to
be
visited."
certainly,
employees
of
contractors
are
contractor
employees
and
they
may
have
occasion
to
visit
a
naval
establishment.
they
are
then
visitors
which
you
cannot
say
that
contractor
employees
who
worked
throughout
their
working
ties
on
governmental
premises
are
therefore
visitors
within
a
meaning
of
this
regulation.
now,
assuming
you
could
even
get
by
this
regulation,
i
want
to
add
one
other
thought
to
which
we've
devoted
our
time
in
our
brief,
these
were
not
published
in
the
federal
register.
they
are
therefore
void
for
that
very
reason,
if
only
makes
use
a
locative
for
the
failure
to
publish
any
of
these
materials
is
that
we
are
told,
they
relate
solely
to
the
internal
management
of
the
agency.
well,
how
can
something
relate
solely
to
the
internal
management
of
an
agency
when
the
consequence
of
applying
the
procedure
supposed
to
be
authorized
by
this,
is
the
cause
a
private
employee
to
loose
her
private
employment.
that
thus,
certainly,
does
not
relate
solely
to
the
internal
management
of
the
agency.
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
legislative
history
of
it,
with
respect
to
that
exception
says,
"we
are
talking
about
matters
of
housekeeping
detail.
we
do
not
think
it's
a
matter
of
a
housekeeping
detail
when
an
employee
of
a
private
employer
is
or
is
looses
her
job
because
she
allegedly
fails
to
meet
security
requirements."
it's
suggested
here
that
no
one
is
saying
that
mrs.
brawner
was
a
communist
and
for
that
reason
she
was
found
not
to
meet
security
requirements.
how
does
anybody
know
that
that
wasn't
the
reason?
we
are
all
tolerably
intelligent
people
when
mrs.
brawner
first
came
to
my
office,
both
she
and
i
and
the
business
agent,
what
we
explore
was
what
conceivably
could
you
have
done
which
would
have
made
you
suspicious
in
terms
of
being
subversive?
it
never
occurred
to
us
that
there
was
anything
else
at
issue.
and
why
not?
let's
see
what
this
employer
says
with
respect
to
mrs.
brawner.
we're
told
that,
"she's
an
unsafe
employee,
she
might
do
something
physically
wrong
there.
she
might
break
dishes
presumably."
well,
this
is
what
her
employer
says
with
respect
to
mrs.
brawner
as
an
employee
and
the
safety
in
terms
of
physical
safety.
he
says,
i'll
read
from
page
62
of
the
record,
"mrs.
brawner
and
i
discussed
it
and
i
have
never
had
any
question
about
her
ability
or
qualifications
and
i
pointed
out
to
her
at
that
time
and
there
was
no
question
about
her
work
and
she
was
satisfactory
so
far
as
the
company
was
concerned.
and
i
told
her
that
i
regretted
to
having
to
do
such
a
thing.
after
all,
like
many
of
our
employees,
she
had
problems
at
different
times,
that
she
would
come
to
me
at
will.
and
actually
we
had
come
in
contact
with
her
throughout
the
day
at
different
times
in
connection
with
her
work.
and
i
can
say,
we
had
no
question
of
her
ability
or
qualifications
to
do
the
job."
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
and
that
has
not
been
preceded
by
action
by
the
government
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
should
hope
that
we
would
have
then
been
able
to
persuade
an
arbitrator
that
that
was
a
discharge
without
good
and
sufficient
cause,
that
an
employer
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
it
would
raise
no
constitutional
question
with
respect
to
the
government,
if
the
government
had
been
acting
about
the
employer.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
employer
doesn't
operate
under
the
proscriptions
of
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
first
amendment.
there
can't
be
no
constitutional
question
with
respect
to
a
private
employer
unless
he
is
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
government
and
there's
no
question
of
that
in
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
for
example,
suppose
this
employee
was
discharged
or
for
security
clearance
was
questioned
because
she
was
a
jew
or
because
she
was
a
negro,
no
one
would
doubt
that
this
was
a
denial
of
substantive
due
process
but
no
one
could
know
that
there
was
a
denial
of
substantive
due
process
on
--
until
procedural
due
process
refers
the
court
in.
and
so,
if
and
that
decisions
of
this
court
in
(inaudible)
and
in
wieman
and
the
dictum
in
--
in
the
mitchell
case,
clearly
indicate
that
even
as
to
governmental
employees,
there
are
certain
things
you
cannot
do
to
such
employees.
you
cannot
discharge
her
for
invoking
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
you
cannot
discharge
them
for
innocent
membership
or
knowing
membership
in
the
communist
party.
well,
if
you
cannot
do
that
to
them,
you
cannot
protect
them,
unless
they
first
get
procedural
due
process.
you
must
first
know
what
is
being
done
before
you
can
know
whether
there's
something
that
could
be
done
about
it.
now,
in
the
government's
brief
there
is
a
suggestion,
that's
voters
are
not
life
or
liberty
and
property
here
for
the
purpose
of
substantive
due
process.
there
is
somehow
not
enough
for
procedural
due
process.
whether
there's
any
primacy
between
the
two,
it's
procedural
due
process.
you
cannot
know
what
is
happening
until
you
are
told
what
is
happening.
perhaps,
this
should
not
belabor
the
distinction
between
mrs.
brawner
as
a
cook
and
mr.
greene
as
an
aeronautical
engineer.
but
there
was
another
case
here
when
greene
was
here,
taylor
v.
mcelroy
was
here,
that
was
dismissed
as
moot.
taylor
was
a
lathe
operator
and
a
tool
and
die
maker.
well,
this
court
mootness
of
aside,
have
decided
taylor
--
decided
taylor
differently
than
it
decided
greene,
because
taylor
was
a
tool
and
a
die
maker
and
greene
was
an
aeronautical
engineer.
and
at
those
two
cases
mootness
aside
had
gone
the
same
way,
are
we
now
to
draw
distinctions
between
cooks
and
lathe
operators?
it
seems
to
us
that
this
sort
of
thing
just
is
a
--
a
kind
of
a
fairyland
detour.
we
have
employees
here
who
are
injured.
mrs.
greene
was
injured
certainly
enough
to
make
it
almost
an
insulting
relevance
--
irrelevancy
to
ask
whether
she
was
injured
more
than
william
greene.
