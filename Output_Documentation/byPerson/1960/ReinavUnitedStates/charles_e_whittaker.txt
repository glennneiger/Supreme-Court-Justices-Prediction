justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
that
mean,
in
your
opinion,
that
there
can
be
no
valid
federal
immunity
legislation?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
believe
this
applies
in
the
outset
that
the
same
words
meant
the
same
thing
in
here
as
in
murdock?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
no.
i
beg
your
pardon.
