justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
proposing
to
argue
to
the
court
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
the
court
can't
take
that
position
--
can't
make
that
construction?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
asked
you.
do
you
say
that
--
that
it
isn't
open
to
the
court
to
close
the
door
to
the
ultimate
constitutional
question
that
you
want
to
raise?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
--
you
like
to
prevail
so
far
as
that
branch
of
the
court
is
concerned
on
the
constitutional
ground,
not
on
the
statutory
ground?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
ground
that
you
think
it
isn't
open
to
take
the
statutory
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
can
do
so
only
on
the
chief
justice's
question
suggest.
if
you
reject
what
the
solicitor
general
is
imposing,
namely
that
as
a
matter
of
construction,
you
have
got
immunity
in
the
state
courts,
do
you
say
that
that
road
isn't
open,
that's
closed?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
--
this
--
this
direction
to
testify
would
sustain
on
a
broader
ground
to
(inaudible)
it
--
it
can't
be
sustained
on
a
narrow
ground,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
your
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what
is
this
60-day
provision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
going
on?
suppose
this
--
suppose
this
judgment
is
affirmed
by
this
court,
what
happens?
will
he
go
to
jail
or
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
check,
627.
i
supposed
it's
in
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
if
there's
a
--
if
there's
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
duty
to
testify
of
the
correct
(inaudible)
that
under
the
judgment
of
--
or
testify,
affirmed
here
would
have
been
under
what
might
be
called
legitimate
challenge
for
the
(inaudible)
law
was
concerned
that
the
opportunity
of
purging
remains
when
the
case
goes
down
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
--
yes,
i
understand
that
but
i'm
speaking
of
what
attack
--
what
my
understanding
of
the
practice.
it
is
my
judgment,
it
it's
entered,
requiring
(inaudible)
and
he
raises
not
of
privilege
questions,
in
effect,
in
which
this
court
grants
certiorari
(inaudible)
that
there
is
always,
when
it
goes
back,
the
judgment
isn't
automatically
enforced
but
there's
an
opportunity
for
purging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
be
wrong
about
that
but
let's
assume
that
that's
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
assuming
in
my
question,
if
you
don't
mind.
assume
that
that's
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
goes
in
back
and
has
this
opportunity
in
saying,
"oh,
i
didn't
understand
that
i
would
have
immunity."
this
protest
--
your
protest
wasn't
that
we
didn't
have
immunity
in
the
statement,
we'll
now
argue
against
it
to
this
moment.
do
you
still
say
there's
no
power?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
your
protest
goes
beyond
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
you
didn't
do
something
in
reliance
on
a
misruling
by
a
court
below.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
and
for
him,
it
is
final
but
we
got
a
system
of
appellate
procedure
by
which
the
finality
of
a
district
judge
is
subject
to
challenge
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
subject
to
challenge
here
as
you're
now
challenging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
suggestion
is
that
you
didn't
uphold
--
you're
not
saying
now,
"oh,
well,
if
my
client
has
known
that
he
is
protected
against
the
use
of
materials
in
the
state
courts.
of
course,
he
would've
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
would've
--
he
would've
answered
the
questions.
your
position
now
is
that
he
was
entitled
not
to
answer
even
if
that's
so,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
--
but
you're
entitled
to
in
which
(inaudible)
no
implication
in
my
questions
--
questions
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
question
that
is
now
raised
is
whether
if
the
immunity
statute
is
construed
so
as
to
protect
you
from
use
in
relation
to
what
was
said
in
the
state
court,
whether
then,
you
are
under
--
you
need
to
respond
and
you're
challenging
that
on
various
grounds
if
you
have
the
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i'm
suggesting
that
you're
not
here
saying
that
you
were
mislead
by
the
ground
on
which
judge
dawson
went.
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
is
a
good
reason
why
he
shouldn't
go
to
jail
without
law.
it
is
not
a
good
reason
for
him
now
that
he's
shown
no
danger
of
going
to
jail,
assuming
all
these
will
be
cleared
up
in
that
opinion
from
still
refusing
to
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
enough,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
enough.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
you
have
opportunity
to
come
to
an
ultimate
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
resist
something
in
your
favor?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
justice,
in
your
opinion,
requires
that
he'd
be
not
required
to
answer.
that's
your
position
at
the
bar
of
this
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
relation
to
the
matter
it's
about
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
am
i
right
in
my
recollection
that
certainly
affecting
that
no
attorney
general
has
ever
recommended
and
all
embracing
immunity
statute,
that
is
an
immunity
statute
available
for
every
kind
of
prosecution
as
in
the
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
is
always
been
ad
hoc
with
reference
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
specific
areas
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
penal
--
penal
liability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
at
least
--
at
least
whatever
power
it
has
about
immunity
is
equally
after
the
(inaudible)
power
that
comes
to
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
narcotics
are
produced
in
this
country?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
the
proportions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
has
to
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
nexus
within
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
have
that,
we
have
a
(inaudible)
available,
potentially
available
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
yes,
it
does.
other
evidence
here
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
yes,
but
it
doesn't
prevent
the
prosecution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
--
that's
the
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
--
i
don't
think
it's
an
ordinary
kind
of
preemption.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
one
doesn't
have
to
decide
that
the
(inaudible)
include
the
less
(inaudible)
isn't
that
kind
of
a
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
that
appropriate
advocacy
for
the
lower
courts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
so
in
that
case
because
james
v.
carter
and
--
but
i
think
it's
one
of
the
most
powerful
briefs
ever
written
to
this
court,
(inaudible)
is
stronger
on
this
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
source
of
the
discussion
in
brown
and
walker
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
james
v.
carter's
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
citation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
been
force
to
pick
the
pardon
of
