mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
turning
first
to
the
question
of
the
60-day
purge
period,
i
would
like
to
say
first
that
we
do
construe
that
provision
of
the
judgment
as
running
not
only
from
the
day
of
the
district
court's
judgment
but
from
the
day
of
an
affirmance
by
this
court,
if
this
court
should
affirm
and
the
return
of
the
mandate.
and
the
reason
why
we
construe
the
purge
period
that
way,
is
the
district
court
explicitly
said,
it's
on
page
34
of
the
record,
that
the
reason
he
put
in
a
purge
period
was
that
he
thought
that
the
petitioner
might
be
raising
this
issue
of
law
and
order
to
get
a
decision
and
he
thought
it
was
fair
for
the
petitioner
to
do
that.
and
we
think
it's
consonant
with
that
understanding
that
the
petitioner
should
have
the
right
to
exhaust
his
appellate
remedies
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court.
also,
we
think
that
the
same
purge
appear
--
period
provision
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
rule
35
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
which
say
that
when
a
case
comes
back
from
this
court,
after
the
affirmance
of
a
--
of
a
conviction
within
60
days,
that's
the
period,
the
petitioner,
the
--
the
defendant
can
go
before
the
district
judge
and
ask
for
a
reduction
or
change
in
the
sentence.
and
so
that
is
why,
mr.
justice
black,
we
ask
for
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
because
we
construe
the
purge
period
as
not
having
elapsed,
this
counsel
said,
but
is
going
in
the
future.
but
i
would
also
like
to
bring
this
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
if
there
should
be
any
doubt
or
if
the
court
should
not
feel
that
its
construction
adoption
of
our
construction
in
the
opinion
should
be
sufficient
and
that
you
want
to
go
further,
this
is
a
contempt
case.
and
in
contempt
cases,
the
court
has
exerted
a
power
over
sentences
that
it
does
not
have
in
the
ordinary
criminal
case.
so
there
would
be
nothing
improper,
it
would
be
in
accordance
with
the
court's
decisions.
if
it
should
feel
it
appropriate,
we
do
not
feel
it
would
be
necessary
but
it's
open
to
the
court
if
it
should
feel
it
appropriate
to
change
the
purge
period
of
the
sentence
by
providing
that
the
60-day
shall
run
explicitly
from
the
return
of
the
mandate
to
the
district
court.
so
there
would
be
no
question
then
that
in
--
in
that
--
on
that
--
when
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
will
be
advised
if,
as
we
submit,
the
court
should
hold
that
the
provision
--
the
immunity
provision
of
the
1956
statute
covers
both
state
and
federal
prosecution.
at
that
time,
the
petitioner
will
be
fully
advised
and
he
will
have
the
opportunity
to
answer
the
questions
under
the
advice
given,
most
authoritatively,
by
this
court.
i
think,
i
should
also
take
the
opportunity
to
point
out
explicitly
because
there
were
some
intimations
to
the
contrary
that
we
do
not
read
the
record
as
in
any
way
indicating
that
this
petitioner
was
misled
either
by
the
government
or
by
the
trial
court.
he
never
asked
the
trial
court
to
--
to
told
whether
or
not
this
provision
covered
state
prosecution.
as
counsel
very,
i
think,
very
deliberately
withheld
questions
of
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
never
took
the
position.
he
didn't
explicitly
say,
"no,
it
doesn't
cover
state
prosecutions."
what
he
said
was,
"it
is
necessary
that
it
covers
state
prosecutions,"
because
under
the
murdock
decision,
this
--
the
--
the
statute
would
be
perfectly
valid
even
if
it
covered
only
federal
prosecutions.
and
of
course,
this
--
this
petitioner
had
counsel
with
him,
who
could
advice
him
just
as
--
as
well
as
any
other
lawyer.
now,
also
on
appeal,
the
statement
has
been
made
that
the
government
argued
that
this
did
not
cover
state
prosecutions.
i
would
like
to
be
a
little
more
explicit
and
perhaps
a
little
more
precise
as
to
what
the
government's
position
has
been
generally
under
this
statute
in
the
lower
courts.
we
--
i
don't
believe
that
it
ever
taken
the
position
that
it
does
not
cover
state
prosecutions.
we
have
generally
said
that
we
think
it
does.
but
in
the
lower
courts,
we
have
said
that
it
doesn't
have
to
cover
state
prosecutions
because
under
the
murdock
rule,
it
wasn't
necessary.
the
--
the
federal
courts,
on
the
whole,
have
adopted
that
position
that
is
most
of
them
have
said
even
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
tedesco
case
which
thought
that
there
was
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
extend
immunity
of
the
state
prosecutions,
said
it
had
no
doubt
that
the
statute
purported
or
congress
intended
to
cover
state
prosecution.
and
that
was
also
true
by
--
of
an
opinion
of
judge
bryan,
judge
frederick
van
pelt
bryan
in
the
pagano
case
and
some
other
cases.
and
in
this
case,
though
the
government's
brief
on
appeal
which
i
have
here
in
the
court
of
appeals
did
argue
quite
strenuously
that
under
murdock,
the
--
it
was
unnecessary
to
cover
state
prosecutions.
it
did
contain
this
paragraph
which
i
should
like
to
read
to
the
court.
â€œif
congress
has
the
power,
immunity
from
both
federal
and
state
prosecution
should
be
granted
under
the
narcotic
control
act,
if
it
does
not,"
that
is
if
congress
does
not
have
the
power,
"then
the
statute
should
be
held
constitutional
by
a
construction
limiting
it
to
federal
prosecution."
so
i
think
accurately
that
position
of
the
government
has
never
been
that
it
does
not
cover
state
prosecutions
but
merely
that
it
was
unnecessary
to
go
into
that
problem.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
our
position
is
that
the
--
that
the
statute
does
grant
the
immunity
and
that
that
congress
does
have
the
power.
and
i
will
only
argue,
if
some
members
of
the
court
would
like
me
to,
that
if
it
--
that
on
the
assumption
that
the
statute
does
not
grant
immunity
over
state
prosecution
or
cannot,
that
the
rule
of
the
murdock
case
should
be
contended.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
justice.
he
was
asked
--
the
questions
--
all
the
questions
appear
on
pages
2
to
7
of
this
record.
and
they
were
not
questions
of
the
type,
are
you
guilty
or
not
guilty
or
did
you
commit
the
offense?
i
will
concede
that
the
general
transactions
on
which
he
was
asked
about,
were,
in
part
at
least,
related
to
the
offense
which
--
for
which
he
was
convicted.
that
is
their
--
he
was
convicted
along
with
several
others
of
a
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
--
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
without
--
without
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
he
--
he
did
not
take
the
stand
of
trials,
i
understand
that
the
conspiracy
draw.
it
was
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
provisions
of
the
narcotics
law
including
the
provisions
which
prohibit
the
unlawful
importation
of
narcotics
into
this
country.
and
as
appears
from
the
opinion
of
judge
learned
hand
in
the
second
circuit
in
242
f.2d,
there
was
apparently
a
large
scale
conspiracy
to
import
into
this
country,
unlawfully
large
amounts
of
narcotics.
and
there
was
a
continuous
going
back
and
forth
to
europe
in
order
to
bring
narcotics
into
this
country
to
france
and
italy
and
other
places.
and
this
defendant
was
--
was
charged
with
conspiracy
to
commit
that
offense
and
he
was
convicted.
and
he
appealed
to
the
second
circuit.
that
conviction
was
affirmed.
another
defendant
sought
certiorari
here
but
this
defendant
did
not.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
he's
already
served.he's
already
served
that
sentence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
served
it
all
and
he's
--
he's
come
out.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he's
out.
and
this
is
a
wholly
separate
question
as
to
whether
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
has
served
that
sentence
and
he
is
now
out
on
that.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
the
reason
that
government,
mr.
justice
black,
is
interested
in
going
ahead
is
i
think,
quite
obvious
on
this
record.
this
was
a
large
scale
conspiracy
in
which
there
are
a
lot
of
people
involved.
the
government
had
gotten
knowledge
of
only
a
few
of
those.
it
was
very
anxious
to
--
to
stop
it,
to
prevent
the
importation
of
this
enormous
amount
of
--
of
narcotics
into
the
country.
the
one
way
it
felt
that
it
could
--
it
could
discover
the
sources
of
this
ring
in
this
conspiracy
was
to
ask
somebody
who
knew
something
about
it
which
petitioner
was
thought
to
be.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes,
yes,
sir.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
well,
i
think,
he
did
have
time
of
the
behavior
as
all
--
as
all
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
don't
--
i
think
now
mr.
stim
will
be
able
to
tell
you.
i
think
that
his
time
has
fully
elapsed
by
now.
i
don't
know
--
i
don't
think
--
he
--
when
he
was
called
before
the
district
judge
on
this
proceeding,
present
proceeding,
he,
of
course,
was
still
in
prison
at
that
time.
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
as
this
case
stands
here
now,
i
don't
think
it
--
it's
legally
significant
as
this
case
stands
here
now.
he
has
completed
the
service
of
his
conspiracy
sentence
and
the
only
question
is,
whether
he
can
be
compelled
under
the
grant
of
immunity
which
congress
has
given
him
to
answer
these
questions
which
the
government
feels
are
necessary
in
order
to
discover
the
sources
of
this
--
or
to
help
discover
the
sources
of
a
--
of
a
large
illicit
narcotics
ring
importing
illegal
contraband
into
the
country.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
yes.
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
wouldn't
--
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
would
--
i
would
say
that,
the
only
thing
i
would
say
is
that
i
think,
i
can't
tell
of
course,
but
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that.
it
isn't
only
just
the
--
the
crime
that
he
committed
but
it's
even
aspects
of
--
of
what
is
believed
to
be
the
--
the
ring
which
were
not
parts
or
charged
in
the
--
in
the
original
indictment
of
conspiracy.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no
distinction.
we
think
the
purpose
of
congress
was
to
be
--
was
to
get
information
to
enable
the
government
to
enforce
the
narcotics
legislation,
federal
narcotics
legislation
more
effectively.
and
one
of
the
--
the
people
from
whom
this
information
can
be
obtained
are,
of
course,
people
who
are
conspirators
who
were
parts
of
a
--
of
a
ring
or
a
conspiracy.
and
so
long
as
this
--
as
the
defendant
cannot
be
prosecuted
again
either
by
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
on
basis
of
--
of
what
he
testifies
to
under
the
immunity,
that
is
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
in
a
relation
to
the
matters,
yes,
mr.
justice,
you're
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
excuse.
he
did
not
give
the
excuse
that
he
would
be
subject
to
--
to
attack
or
so
or
death.
he
gave
no
excuse.
he
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
other
defendants
have
that's
why
i
said
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
but
this
defendant
did
not
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
so
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
he
may
have
served
his
given
--
paid
his
debt
to
society
insofar
as
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law
was
concerned.
but
he
has
not
paid
the
obligation
he
owes
to
the
society
in
which
all
citizens
owe
of
giving
information
to
the
public
officials
if
they,
themselves,
if
the
person
who
gives
the
information
is
not
going
to
be
subject
to
incrimination
for
at
least
two
centuries
since
lord
hartwood's
day
(ph)
it
has
been
said
that
every
citizen
owes
to
the
public
the
giving
of
information
with
respect
to
possible
criminality.
this
privilege
against
self
--
self-incrimination
stands
against
that
obligation
where
the
man
himself
will
be
incriminated.
but
where
that
is
removed
and
he
will
not
be
incriminated,
the
obligation
to
give
evidence
remains
and
this
man,
though
has
fulfilled
the
obligation
with
so
far
--
insofar
as
having
committed
a
crime
is
concerned,
has
not
fulfilled
the
obligation
insofar
as
giving
information
is
concerned.
now,
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
you
mean
where
--
where
man
has
been
called
up
after
he's
been
convicted
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
frankly
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
frankly,
i
--
i
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
this
--
this
is
a
problem
that
has
not
been
adverted
to
by
the
courts
that
is
--
as
far
as
i
--
i've
seen
in
my
reading,
no
court
has
made
any
distinction
between
whether
the
man
has
already
served
his
sentence,
already
--
already
been
convicted
or
whether
he's
called
up
before
he's
been
prosecuted.
there
had
been
many
discussions
about
this
matter
but
this
particular
distinction,
i
have
not
seen
in
any
of
the
--
in
any
of
the
opinions
that
is
as
between
a
man
who
has
served
his
sentence
and
a
man
who
--
who
was
not
(inaudible).
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
morning
i
should
like
to
discuss,
if
i
may
first
and
briefly,
the
statutory
question
of
whether
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956
does
cover
state
prosecutions
and
secondly
the
constitutional
question
of
whether
congress
may
so
provide.
and
third,
i
would
like
to
touch
also
briefly
on
the
propriety
of
the
two-year
sentence
which
was
given
by
the
district
court.
and
then
i
shall
return
to
the
problem
posed
by
the
chief
justice
at
the
end
of
the
argument
yesterday
as
to
whether
there
is
a
different
rule
with
respect
to
such
immunity
provision
as
this
for
a
man
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
--
of
a
crime
and
is
then
sought
to
be
questioned
about
transactions
involved
in
that
crime.
unless
some
justice
should
--
should
desire
me
to,
i
do
not
propose
to
argue
the
alternative
position
of
the
government
which
is,
of
course,
that
if
either
the
immunity
provision
does
not
cover
state
prosecutions
because
congress
did
not
intended
to
do
so
or
it
does
not
cover
it
because
congress
could
not
do
so,
then
under
the
rule,
the
murdock
case
in
284
united
states,
the
immunity
is
sufficient
though
it
covers
only
federal
prosecution.
we
of
course
do
not
waive
or
abandon
that
argument.
we
think
it
is
unnecessary
to
the
court
to
reach
it
and
therefore,
i
--
i
shall
not
seek
to
discuss
it
unless
some
justice
should
wish
me
to
do
so.
going
very
briefly
to
the
question,
the
statutory
question
of
whether
this
provision
does
cover
state
prosecutions.
the
first
thing
to
know
is
that
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
statute
are
the
provisions
which
grant
the
immunity
are
in
the
same
words
as
the
compulsory
testimony
act
of
1893
which
the
court
held
in
brown
against
walker
in
1896
did
cover
state
prosecutions.
and
that
those
substantive
provisions
were
carried
forward
into
the
1954
statute
relating
to
so-called
subversive
activities
and
into
the
1956
statute
relating
to
narcotic
legislation
as
in
this
case.
but
perhaps
more
significant
and
we
think
absolutely
conclusive
is
the
fact
that
this
narcotics
provi
--
this
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956
was
formulated
and
enacted
after
this
court
had
decided
the
ullmann
case.
the
court
decided
the
ullmann
case
in
march,
1956.
in
may,
1956,
the
narcotic
subcommittee
of
the
ways
and
means
committee
of
the
house
of
representative
issued
its
voluminous
report
suggesting
various
provisions
for
the
legislation
which
was
to
become
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956.
and
it
included
in
that
proposal
an
immunity
provision
and
a
bill
was
thereupon
drafted
and
presented
to
congress
which
concluded
the
same
immunity
provision
in
the
terms
with
the
necessary
changes
to
cover
narcotic
legislation,
in
the
terms
of
the
1954
provision
which
the
court
had
already
held
in
the
ullmann
case
some
month
before
did
cover
state
prosecution.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
you
are
right,
mr.
justice
--
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
to
particular
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
and
i'll
take
this
opportunity
to
stress
a
particular
point
about
this
statute
which
unlike
the
statute
in
brown
against
walker
and
in
many
of
the
other
cases
as
in
the
(inaudible)
case
and
others
gave
immunity
with
respect
to
a
concerning
transactions
matters
and
events
which
were
testified
to
in
any
grand
jury
proceeding
whether
the
government
intended
or
personally
intended
to
grant
immunity
or
not,
this
is
a
new
kind
of
statute
which
came
into
the
books
with
the
1954
statute
which
is
that
the
immunity
is
only
granted
by
the
statute
if
the
united
states
attorney
with
the
concurrence
of
the
attorney
general
acting
in
the
--
in
the
public
interest
should
state
that
immunity
was
necessary.
now
this
statute
has
been
on
the
books
now
a
little
over
for
four
years.
it
was
passed
in
july,
1956.
in
that
four-year
time,
immunity
has
been
accorded
under
the
statute
to
only
13
persons,
including
this
petitioner.
the
attorney
general
did
authorize
that
immunity
be
accorded
to
five
other
persons
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
one
reason
or
another
to
seek
an
order
from
the
court.
so
that
actually
only
13
persons
have
been
accorded
immunity
under
the
statute
in
the
four-and-a-half
year
period
which
has
elapsed
since
its
enactment.
i
think
that
is
all
that
i
need
to
say
on
the
statutory
question
of
whether
this
immunity
provision
does
cover
state
prosecutions.
its
history,
its
wording,
its
background
going
back
to
brown
and
walker
i
think
make
it
clear
that
it
does.
then
the
second
question
is
whether
congress
may
validly
so
provide.
some
doubt
was
cast
upon
this
by
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
tedesco
case.
it
is
a
doubt
which
i
think
need
not
have
arisen
and
which
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
can
--
to
try
to
lay
completely
to
rest.
the
short
answer,
the
short
answer
for
us
is
that
in
brown
against
walker,
in
1896,
repeated
by
this
court
in
the
ullmann
case
in
1956
and
again
in
emanuel
brown
against
the
united
states,
a
contempt
case
arising
under
the
motor
carrier
act
in
1959,
the
court
we
think
indicated
very
clearly
that
when
congress
is
acting
under
the
commerce
power,
there
is
no
doubt
of
its
--
of
its
authority
to
grant
immunity
which
covers
state
prosecution
as
well
as
federal
prosecution.
the
court
so
said
in
brown
against
walker
and
this
was
repeated
in
the
ullmann
case.
now
what
we
have
here
in
large
part
--
of
what
we
have
here
instead
of
narcotic
legislation,
which
rests
on
two
bases;
one,
the
power
of
a
foreign
interstate
commerce
and
foreign
affairs
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
power
over
the
taxing
power
on
the
other.
and
what
i
would
like
to
stress
for
the
court,
if
i
may,
is
the
importance
of
the
foreign
and
--
and
interstate
commerce
aspect
of
--
of
the
narcotics
legislation,
particularly
as
applied
to
this
case.
the
original
--
this
we
think
is
the
core
and
the
basis
of
federal
narcotics
legislation
and
particularly
appropriate
here,
congress
had
it
in
mind
as
i
shall
point
out
when
it
pass
--
when
it
enacted
the
immunity
provision
of
this
1956
act.
let
me
take
you
back
into
history.
the
first
federal
statute
was
the
opium
exclusion
act
of
1909
which
was
--
which
was
so
clearly
valid
under
the
commerce
clause
that
is
it
prevented
the
unlawful
importation
of
opium
and
thereafter
prohibited
the
use
of
opium
which
had
been
unlawfully
imported.
it
was
so
clearly
valid
that
in
--
in
the
brolan
case,
when
someone
sought
to
take
the
constitutional
issue
to
this
court,
the
court
dismissed
the
writ
of
error
as
frivolous.
it
said
that
the
--
that
the
power
of
congress
to
preclude
the
importation
of
--
of
opium
and
similar
bad
products
was
so
clear
that
it
would
not
either
consider
the
question
substantially.
then
there
came
the
harrison
narcotics
act
which
was
based
largely,
though
not
completely
upon
the
taxing
power.
but
then
in
1921,
congress
did
pass
the
narcotics
drugs
import
and
export
act
which
was
wholly
based
upon
the
foreign
and
interstate
commerce
powers
and
related
to
the
importation
to
this
country
of
--
of
narcotics,
drugs
and
the
exportation
from
the
country
of
narcotics
drugs.
and
in
1941,
congress
enacted
another
statute,
having
to
do
with
the
carriage
of
narcotic
drugs
on
american
vessels
in
foreign
commerce,
which
was
also
clearly
based
on
--
on
the
interstate
commerce
power.
and
more
than
that,
the
central
--
perhaps
the
most
central
bid
in
this
--
in
the
complex
of
federal
legislation
is
the
presumption
which
congress
put
it
into
the
federal
narcotics
legislation
that
when
a
man
is
found
in
possession
of
narcotics
on
stand
and
without
an
order
on
stand
that
there
shall
be
--
it
shall
be
presume
to
have
been
illegally
imported
unless
the
defendant
chose
to
the
contrary.
now
that
presumption
was
upheld
in
the
eem
case
many
years
ago
and
has
been
consistently
upheld
and
applied
by
this
court.
i
mentioned
it
to
show
that
the
--
that
though
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
narcotics
legislation
rests
on
the
taxing
power
and
i
hasten
to
say
that
a
little
later
in
my
argument,
i
will
support
preemption
if
you
can
call
it
that
even
on
the
taxing
power,
but
at
this
point
in
my
argument,
i
want
to
lay
bare
for
the
court
the
important
role
of
the
federal
commerce
power,
the
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
power
in
--
in
the
--
underpinning
of
federal
narcotics
legislation.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no
sir.
i
--
i'm
making
this
argument
solely
cause
i
think
i
can
bring
myself
squarely
within
the
decisions
of
this
court
under
brown,
walker
and
ullmann
where
they
talked
about
the
commerce
power.
and
that's
why
i
--
i
do
not
and
i
will
go
on
to
say
that
where
--
i
will
say
that
wherever
the
congress
has
constitutional
power
to
legislate,
i
think
that
it
will
have
constitutional
power
to
adopt
an
immunity
provision
like
this.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
i
hasten
to
say
that
the
only
reason
i
am
making
this
argument
now
is
because
i
think
that
i
can
fall
directly
within
two
or
three
decisions
of
this
court
without
any
need
even
to
extrapolate
from
the
theories
which
have
been
laid
down
in
those
decisions.
and
i
would
like
to
take
one
moment,
if
i
may,
to
point
out
to
the
court
how
congress
took
account
of
--
of
the
foreign
and
interstate
commerce
aspects
of
narcotic
legislation
in
this
very
immunity
provision.
at
pages
2
and
3
of
the
government's
brief,
we
have
set
out
the
immunity
provision
section
1406
and
the
court
will
note
that
--
that
congress
referred
to
three
types
of
federal
statutes
as
to
which
if
testimony
were
compelled,
the
immunity
would
be
granted.
now
the
first
part
which
remains
to
the
--
internal
revenue
code
is
basically
the
taxing
legislation
founded
on
the
harrison
act
of
1914,
but
even
that
--
even
in
that
portion
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
there
is
interwoven
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
powers.
that
is
in
that
very
section
of
the
internal
revenue
code
there
are
provisions
that
people
who
get
possession
of
--
of
narcotics
and
then
carried
them
in
interstate
commerce
are
committing
a
crime,
so
that
interstate
commerce
enters
into
even
that
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
provisions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
opium
is
--
is
sometimes
grown
and
marijuana
is
--
is
sometimes
grown.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
is
relatively
small.
i
think
the
basic
problem
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that's
right.
the
basic
problem
is
--
is
to
try
to
prevent
drugs
from
coming
into
this
country
from
abroad.
that's
the
basic
problem
that
the
--
the
federal
narcotics
bureau
and
the
federal
congressmen
have
been
trying
to
deal
with.
now
the
second
section,
subsection
of
--
of
this
statute
is
the
narcotic
drugs
import
and
export
act
which
as
i've
mentioned
before
deals
wholly
with
foreign
and
interstate
commerce.
and
the
third
section,
the
act
of
july
11,
1941
deals
with
the
carriage
of
drugs
on
american
vessels
in
foreign
commerce.
and
of
course
as
i
tried
to
point
out
yesterday
in
this
particular
case,
foreign
commerce
and
interstate
commerce
is
the
nub
of
it.
this
was
a
conspiracy
to
import
large
amounts
of
narcotics
drugs
into
the
united
states.
and
as
the
court
can
see
from
reading
through
the
questions
which
were
sought
to
be
ask
under
this
--
under
the
immunity
statute,
almost
every
single
one
of
them
deals
with
the
question
of
importation
of
drugs
into
the
country.
they
deal
with
--
dealing
with
french
groups
abroad,
groups
in
europe,
means
of
--
of
bringing
drugs
into
the
country,
the
obtaining
of
passports
for
the
purpose
of
going
abroad
to
obtain
drugs
and
so
forth.
now
i
would
like
--
like
to
argue
the
issue
which
mr.
justice
black
called
to
my
attention
and
that
is
the
power
of
congress
to
grant
this
immunity
regardless
of
the
basis
of
its
--
of
its
action
in
the
constitution.
that
is
once
it
is
assumed
that
congress
has
constitutional
power
to
enact
the
substantive
legislation
as
this
court
has
held
that
the
narcotics
legislation
was
validly
adopted
either
under
the
taxing
powers
or
under
the
commerce
powers
then
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
barrier
to
congress
adopting
an
immunity
provision
which
covers
state
prosecutions.
the
court
has
already
held
that
--
that
the
narcotics
legislation
under
the
taxing
power
enable
--
can
use
and
make
available
for
itself
other
kinds
of
reg
--
regulations
such
as
registration,
the
order
forms,
provisions
for
--
for
stamps
on
packages.
this
is
an
implementation
of
the
taxing
power
which
the
court
has
held
was
appropriate.
now
the
court
has
never
held,
in
fact
the
court
has
held
the
opposite,
that
--
that
the
necessary
and
proper
clauses
of
the
constitution,
necessary
and
proper
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
applied
for
the
taxing
power,
the
commerce
power
all
the
powers
in
which
congress
enjoys.
i
think
the
court
yesterday
in
the
john
hancock
mutual
life
insurance
case
gave
it
--
the
latest
example
of
--
of
upholding
an
action
of
congress
in
that
very
field.
it
is
in
that
case
the
farmers
home
administration
which
had
made
the
loan
was
acting
under
the
--
the
welfare
--
the
payments
for
grants
under
the
welfare
clause,
the
first
section
of
article
1,
section
8,
not
one
of
the
so-called
regulatory
sections
of
article
1,
section
8.
and
the
court
--
and
the
property
which
--
which
congress
was
protecting
and
which
the
court
held
could
be
protected
was
of
course
under
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution,
not
under
the
one
of
the
so-called
regulatory
clause
is
the
commerce
clause
and
war
power.
and
in
the
john
hancock
case
yesterday,
the
court
held
that
congress
could
constitutionally
preempt,
that
is
this
place
state
rules
and
there,
as
i
say,
that
congress
was
acting
on
the
two
non,
so-called
non
regulatory
powers,
the
property
power
of
the
constitution,
the
property
clause
of
the
constitution,
and
the
general
power
to
grant
farms
under
the
first
section,
the
same
section
which
contains
the
power
to
lay
taxes.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
this
is
the
--
the
latest
example,
a
holding
of
the
court
that
the
power
of
congress
to
supersede
and
preempt
state
legislation
is
universal,
that
is
it
is
not
limited
to
any
power
that
congress
has.
and
i
would
go
on
to
say
that
what
--
what
i
think
what
the
congress
has
done
here
is
a
kind
of
partial
or
pro
tanto
preemption.
it
hasn't
said,
"no
state
narcotics
legislation
shall
remain
on
the
books
as
i
think
it
could."
and
as
i
think
the
court
way
back
intimated
this
and
i'll
explain
in
a
minute,
it
hasn't
said
that
congress
has
been
very
careful
not
to
say
that.
in
the
1956
statute,
one
of
the
sponsors
of
the
legislation
took
the
pains
to
put
it
into
the
legislative
history
a
statement,
though
i
don't
think
it
was
actually
read
on
the
floor
of
congress
that
congress
did
not
want
the
1956
statute
to
be
considered
a
general
preemption
of
state
narcotics
law
so
that
they
were
still
to
remain
concurrent
power.
but
what
an
immunity
provision
is,
i
think,
it's
a
pro
tanto
or
a
partial
supersession
or
preemption
as
i
say.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
it
--
it
prevents
--
no
i
think
it
prevents
the
--
the
entire
prosecution
even
if
it's
obtained
through
other
--
other
evidence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
related
to
this.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
doesn't.
but
in
practical
effect
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
isn't.
but
i
--
but
i
think
it
--
if
you
--
it
can
be
viewed
possibly
in
that
light
and
i
think
it
maybe
easier
for
some
like
the
sixth
circuit
who
found
it
difficult
to
accept
the
notion,
if
to
put
it
in
the
light,
the
fact
that
congress
clearly
has
the
power
of
preemption
and
--
and
supersession
even
in
the
narcotics
field
and
it
hasn't
gone
that
far
here.
it
has
gone
much
less.
and
i
say
--
i
think
quite
accurately
that
congress
has
the
power
to
impose
supersession
preemption
even
in
the
narcotics
field
because
back
in
256
united
states
in
the
case
of
wipple
against
markinson,
the
question
arose
whether
a
state
law,
i
think
it
was
the
narcotics
law
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
had
been
superseded
by
the
harrison
narcotics
act
of
1914
and
the
supreme
court
held
no,
it
had
not
been,
but
the
whole
intimation
of
the
including
part
of
the
opinion
is
that
of
course
congress
could,
congress
could
and
if
there
were
a
conflict
or
there
were
some
inconsistency,
then
the
state
law
would
have
to
fall
but
the
court
found
there
was
no
inconsistency.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
it
isn't
but
i
--
i
think
that
if
i
can
later
--
later
to
rest
the
--
greater
problem
or
at
least
indicate
that
there's
i
think
no
substantiality
to
it,
i
think
i
will
gone
forward
with
my
--
with
my
argument.
i'd
also
point
out
that
in
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
upheld
immunity
provisions
against
state
legislation
such
as
brown
against
walker
and
ullmann,
there
was
concurrent
state
power.
the
auditor
in
brown
against
walker
claimed
that
he
might
be
guilty
of
embezzlement
or
he
might
have
defrauded
some
persons
in
connection
with
--
with
--
connection
with
that
the
transactions
about
which
he
was
being
questioned.
in
other
words
the
state
of
pennsylvania
might
if
he
had
really
done
such
things,
might
have
been
able
to
prosecute
him
so
it
wasn't
the
case
in
which
all
the
power
over
the
particular
transaction
was
in
the
federal
government.
now
the
same
thing
is
true
in
the
ullmann
case.
though
it's
true
that
the
federal
government
as
the
court
held
later
after
on
a
week
after
on
pennsylvania
against
nelson
that
the
federal
government
had
superseded
state
sedition
laws
of
the
--
comparable
to
the
smith
act
the
court
was
very
careful
even
in
the
nelson
case
to
say
that
the
--
that
congress
had
not
superseded
a
whole
mass
of
--
of
state
legislation
which
impinged
on
that
problem
such
as
sabotage
and
other
things
or
even
a
seditious
legislation
directed
against
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania
alone
not
against
the
united
states
government.
so
the
cases
which
the
court
has
already
had,
i
think,
indicate
that
there
is
concurrent
power
so-called
in
the
states
in
those
areas
and
nevertheless,
that
congress
has
had
the
--
has
been
held
to
have
the
authority
to
pass
a
valid
immunity
provision
which
exclude
--
covered
state
prosecutions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
the
government
mainly
argued
that
that
murdock
is
still
a
good
law
and
then
it's
just
a
passing
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
statute
was
valid
--
a
validly
covered
state
prosecutions.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
it
is
and
that's
what
the
lower
courts
have
been
doing
in
this
field.
i
think
perhaps
that
none
of
them
realized
the
close
connection
of
the
statute
in
this
case
to
the
ullmann
case.
i
think
none
of
them
realized
the
statute
here
was
enacted
after
the
ullmann
case
has
been
decided.
in
fact,
it
was
being
formulated
after
the
ullmann
case
and
that
made
him
--
made
him
a
little
hesitant
about
saying
that
it
had
the
same
meaning.
in
any
case,
we
make
the
argument
here
that
that
it
does
cover
state
prosecutions
and
that
it
may
validly
do
so.
there
is
a
suggestion
i
think
perhaps
in
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
that
if
congress
can
do
that
here,
it
can
do
it
everywhere,
there
can
be
a
general
immunity
provision
covering
abolishing
all
state
prosecutions.
i
think
our
answer
to
that
would
--
would
stem
--
would
be
first
that
congress
has
to
indicate
that
congress
is
sensitive
to
the
role
of
the
states.
congress
is
after
all
composed
in
the
--
in
the
upper
chamber
of
representatives
of
the
states
and
congress
has
never
sought
to
preempt
federal
legislation
completely
through
the
ordinary
preemption
power
and
i
think
there's
very
little
likelihood
that
it
would
try
to
immunize
all
state
prosecutions
with
res
--
in
connection
with
some
federal
criminal
legislation.
and
if
that
were
not
answered
enough,
i
call
upon
three
statements
that
this
court
has
made
in
recently
years
and
the
first
is
what
chief
justice
taft
sent
an
ex
parte
grossman.
ex
parte
grossman
was
a
case
in
which
the
president
had
pardoned
a
man
for
contempt
and
the
contempt
consisted
of
disobeying
an
order
of
a
court,
district
court
of
the
united
states
and
the
president
pardoned
the
man.
and
the
argument
was
made
is
that
it
would
violate
still
separation
of
powers
for
the
president
to
be
able
to
pardon
a
man
who
would
compe
--
committed
a
contempt
of
court
and
it
was
said
that
if
this
were
allowed,
a
president
could
completely
impede
the
efficiency
and
the
administration
of
the
court
by
pardoning
people
completely
who
would
be
violating
court
orders.
and
chief
justice
taft,
of
course,
had
been
both
president
and
was
chief
justice
gave
what
i
think
is
the
--
the
classic
answer
to
it.
i
won't
attempt
to
read
it
here
though
in
the
grossman
case,
267
united
states
at
pages
119
and
121,
he
referred
to
the
interdependence
of
all
branches
of
the
government
and
he
said
there
was
no
branch
of
the
government
or
no
part
of
the
government
which
could
be
completely
independent
that
congress
could
refuse
to
make
appropriations,
the
president
can
refuse
to
make
appointments,
the
president
could
have
refused
to
--
to
enforce
laws,
but
that
you
could
not
construe
a
power
of
--
granted
to
a
--
a
prior
federal
government
in
the
constitution
while
thinking
of
the
ultimate
breakdown
of
constitutional
government.
and
they
ended
up
by
sa
--
by
saying,
if
it
can
be
said
that
the
president
by
successive
pardons
of
constantly
recurring
contempt
of
particular
litigation
might
deprive
the
court
the
power
to
enforce
its
neighbors
and
its
orders
in
a
reconcile
of
neighborhood,
it
is
enough
to
observe
that
such
a
course
is
so
improbable
as
to
furnish
by
little
basis
for
argument.
exceptional
cases
like
this,
if
it
to
be
imagined
at
all
would
suggest
to
resort
to
impeachment
rather
than
to
a
narrow
and
strained
construction
of
the
general
powers
of
the
president.
we
think
by
analogy,
that
applies
here
and
i
would
also
of
course
refer
the
court
to
what
justice
stone
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
aaa
case,
the
butter
case
that
you
cannot
construe
general
--
general
legislation
which
is
properly
founded
in
the
constitution
on
the
basis
of
what
possibly
abuses
my
result
in
the
future
by
someone
malevolent
or
seeking
to
--
to
do
away
with
the
structure
of
the
government.
and
last,
i
would
rely
of
course
upon
what
justice
holmes
said
that
in
the
ultimate
analysis,
this
court
sits,
in
the
ultimate
analysis
this
court
sits
and
if
the
power
is
carried
to
extend
in
a
particular
case
or
situation,
this
court
will
be
sitting
here.
now
i
turn
--
i
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
question
of
the
two-year
sentence.
i
won't
again
discuss
the
purge
provision
which
i
talk
about
yesterday.
i
just
want
to
point
out,
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
how
this
case
differs
from
the
emanuel
brown
case
in
which
on
behalf
of
three
other
justices
and
yourself,
you
wrote
a
dissent
from
the
--
the
sentence
in
that
case.
that
case
was
a
summary
case.
it
was
not
a
--
this
is
not
a
summary
case.
this
was
not
a
summary
proceeding.
it
was
a
full
scale
proceeding
with
days
elapsing
in
which
there
was
full
opportunity
for
counsel
to
argue
on
the
sense
and
he
did
argue
on
the
sense.
also,
that
case,
there
was
no
purge
clause,
there
was
a
purge
clause
which
is
inserted
in
this
--
in
this
case
and
this
i
said
yesterday,
we
construe
the
purge
clause
as
running
from
the
day
of
the
--
the
mandate
of
this
court
returns
the
case
to
the
lower
court
and
if
the
court
should
be
unhappy
about
accepting
our
construction
or
making
its
own
construction,
we
think
it
has
power
because
this
is
a
contempt
case
to
revise
the
sentence
explicitly
to
say
that.
thirdly,
we
would
point
out
that
this
is
a
narcotics
case
and
narcotics
of
various
--
narcotics
violations
are
very
serious
offenses
which
congress
has
laid
down
very
severe
punishments.
in
the
brown
case,
the
--
the
matters
into
--
into
which
the
grand
jury
was
inquiring,
led
to
census
of
only
a
farm.
and
i
think
from
the
opinion
of
the
dissenters
in
that
case,
indicated
that
this
was
an
important
factor.
here
the
issues
--
the
types
of
matters
that
are
sought
to
be
gone
into
are
--
are
important
aspects
of
federal
narcotic
legislation.
and
lastly,
i
would
say
that
in
--in
--
if
you
take
the
comparable
sentences
given
to
other
defendants
under
this
immunity
statute
in
the
last
four
years,
they
have
been
either
two
years
or
18
months
and
so
that
if
you
look
at
the
question
of
comparability,
this
is
not
out
of
line.
now
i
should
like
to
return
in
the
minutes
remaining,
if
i
may
to
the
problem
that
the
chief
justice
raised
at
the
end
of
the
day
yesterday.
i
said
in
answer
to
a
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
i
didn't
know
of
any
case
under
immunity
provision
in
which
a
man
had
been
questioned
concerning
a
matter
for
which
he
had
already
been
convicted
in
the
--
in
an
ultimate
appellate
court.
there
are
cases
in
the
lower
courts
under
this
very
statute.
there
are
cases
in
the
lower
courts
and
i
think
under
some
other
statutes.
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
--
i
mean
the
--
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
last
footnote
of
its
opinion,
cites
three
court
cases
in
new
york
and
the
appellate
division
and
the
lower
court
in
new
york
which
are
comparable
to
that.
and
i
don't
know
of
any
such
cases
but
i
think
i
should
say
in
all
candor
that
it's
hard
to
find
because
there
are
no
cases
as
far
as
i
can
tell
in
which
this
issue
has
been
raised
in
--
in
that
--
in
this
fashion.
i
don't
even
think
this
petitioner
raises
the
issue
in
that
fashion,
because
his
argument
was
that
if
the
government
pardoned
him
for
the
narcotics
offense
for
which
he
was
then
serving
a
sentence
and
remitted
the
fine
and
if
his
--
he
was
immune
from
prosecution
under
status
as
well
as
federal
law,
then
he
could
be
compelled
to
answer.
he
did
not
take
the
position
that
once
having
been
convicted;
he
could
not
be
compelled
to
answer.
his
position
was
that
he
should
--
that
the
rest
of
his
sentence
should
have
been
remitted
and
the
fine
should
have
been
remitted.
so
i
don't
think
that
even
he
has
made
that
argument
in
this
case.
and
as
indicated
yesterday,
at
the
present
posture
of
the
case,
he
is
no
longer
--
he
has
fully
served
his
sentence
and
he
is
no
longer
subject
to
that
sentence.
but
i
would
like
to
go
further
because
i
think
that
the
--
that
the
possibility
of
a
distinction
under
the
immunity
act
between
men
who
have
been
tried
and
convicted
and
men
who
have
not,
that
is
between
this
petitioner
on
the
one
hand
and
men
like
ullmann
or
the
browns
in
the
brown
against
walker
and
brown
against
united
states
cases
will
not
stand
against
the
theory
of
the
self
incrimination
clause
and
the
general
law
which
has
grown
up
again
--
around
that
clause
in
the
last
century
and
a
half.
the
theory
of
the
self
incrimination
clause
is
that
it
protects
against
criminality.
it
protects
against
criminality.
it
does
not
protect
against
disgrace
or
infamy
or
the
kind
of
exposure
or
attack
which
people
maybe
subjected
to
if
they're
required
to
reveal
that
they
have
engaged
in
something
which
might
otherwise
be
a
crime
or
would
be
morally
turpitudinous.
this
court
held
that
very
clearly
in
the
brown
against
walker
case.
mr.
justice
brown
in
his
majority
opinion
made
a
great
point
of
it
because
mr.
justice
field
in
dissent
had
said
that
the
--
the
clause
did
protect
against
disgrace
and
infamy.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes
mr.
justice
and
that's
why
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
mr.
justice
field
quoted
part
of
mr.
carter's
argument
or
paraphrased
it
in
his
dissent,
but
it
was
rejected
by
the
majority
of
the
court
and
then
hale
against
henkel
a
few
years
later
again
explicitly
rejected
the
same
notion.
and
much
later,
in
the
smith
case
in
337
united
states,
in
passing
the
court
rejected
it.
and
i
think
again
in
the
ullmann
case,
it
was
rejected
because
the
opinion
of
the
court
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
refers
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
had
just
indicated
to
mr.
carter's
argument
sets
it
out
and
paraphrases
in
footnote
in
which
indicates
that
one
of
the
arguments
he
made
was
the
argument
based
on
disgrace
or
infamy,
and
that
said
it
was
rejected
in
--
in
brown
against
walker
and
has
been
--
and
there's
no
reason
to
over
--
overturn
that
finding
that
holding.
congress
has
rejected
it
insofar
as
appearances
before
congressional
committees
are
concerned.
just
long
ago
as
the
act
of
january
24th,
19
--
1862,
1862
almost
100
years
ago,
congress
provided
that
no
person
can
refuse
to
appear
and
testify
when
validly
called
before
a
congressional
committee
on
the
ground
that
to
so
testify
would
tend
to
degrade
or
--
degrade
him
or
lead
to
infamy.
it
said
so
explicitly.
the
state
cases
have
--
have
almost
universally
adopted
this
rule.
i
think
there
may
possibly
be
one
or
two
jurisdictions
of
the
united
states
which
do
not
follow.
there's
a
recent
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey,
ray
vince
and
2
new
jersey
at
443,
an
opinion
written
by
late
mr.
justice
berlin
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
which
surveys
the
law
and
indicate
--
and
adopts
from
new
jersey
the
rule
that
disgrace
or
infamy
is
not
enough.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
two
new
jersey,
443,
ray
vince.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
vince
v-i-n-c-e.
now
of
course,
professor
whittemore
has
an
elaborate
discussion
in
his
book
in
which
he
points
out
that
--
that
the
rule
--
what
shall
i
say,
the
privilege
against
infamy
or
disgrace
seem
to
have
been
--
have
gotten
started
in
the
english
common
law.
it
did
not
take
route
in
the
united
states
and
by
the
end
of
the
19th
century
and
today,
it
has
almost
no
routes
in
this
country
at
all.
and
where
it
does,
it
only
collaterally
with
respect
to
--
the
privilege
has
always
been
said
not
to
apply
where
the
matter
is
directly
in
issue.
that
is
you
can't
refuse
to
testify
on
the
ground
of
disgrace
of
infamy
where
something
is
central
to
your
testimony.
it
was
a
collateral
matter.
it's
a
collateral
matter
then
you
may,
in
those
jurisdictions
where
this
privilege
shall
maintain.
similarly,
i
think
another
--
another
universally
accepted
rule,
two
other
universally
accepted
rules
indicate
that
disgrace
or
infamy
is
not
the
basis
of
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
and
the
first
is
that
if
the
statute
of
limitations
is
clearly
run,
the
almost
universal
rule
is
that
--
that
the
man
can
be
compelled
to
testify
without
immunity
statute,
even
absolute
immunity
statute.
if
the
statute
of
limitations
is
clearly
run,
then
--
then
the
man
can
be
compelled
to
testify.
and
on
that
simply
because
i
happen
to
find
it
and
it's
a
very
recent
case,
there's
an
opinion
of
mr.
justice
brennan
sitting
on
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
called
ray
pillow,
11
new
jersey
8
which
holds
explicitly
that
if
the
statute
of
limitations
is
run,
the
immunity
--
i
mean
the
privilege
cannot
be
afforded.
and
similarly,
if
a
pardon
is
granted
to
a
man,
if
a
pardon
is
granted
to
a
man,
he
can
be
forced
to
testify.
that's
the
--
began
on
the
famous
case
of
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
that's
what
the
court
held
in
the
birdie
case
and
then
i
--
i'm
not
so
certain
if
that
rule
still
exist.
well
mr.
justice
holmes
in
the
pankovich
case,
i
think
somewhat
cut
into
it
in
pankovich
against
federal,
but
anyway,
if
he
does
take
the
pardon,
he
can
then
be
force
to
testify.
queen
against
boyes
was
cited
by
my
brother
yesterday,
an
english
case,
says
that
explicitly,
and
that
i
think
has
been
the
rule
in
the
united
states.
more
than
that,
more
than
that,
there
seems
to
be
the
rule
throughout
the
united
states
that
even
though
there
is
no
immunity
provision,
if
a
man
has
been
convicted
or
acquitted,
convicted
or
acquitted,
he
can
be
compelled
to
testify
respecting
the
subject
matters
of
his
conviction
or
acquittal
because
the
theory
is
he
is
no
longer
able
to
be
tried
under
the
principles
of
double
jeopardy
and
res
judicata.
therefore,
he
is
not
in
danger
of
criminality
and
--
and
he
can
--
he
can
be
tried.
this
is
absence
in
immunity
provision.
whittemore
says
this
is
universally
conceded
and
i
have
found
no
exceptions
to
it
in
the
united
states
or
hadn't
made
it
actually
exhaust
to
survey.
the
second
circuit
recently
in
three
cases
laid
down
this
rule
as
well
established
in
the
same
opinion
i
mentioned
to
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
ray
pillow.
one
of
the
grounds
in
which
pillow
was
forced
to
testify
with
respect
to
certain
transactions
he
had
pleaded
guilty.
and
the
court
there
held
that
the
immunity
no
longer
--
i
mean
that
the
privilege
no
longer
exists
as
far
as
he
was
concerned.
in
the
--
in
the
opinion
in
brown
against
walker,
famous
opinion
brown
against
walker,
the
court
cites
and
quotes
from
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
ex
parte
kone
back
in
104
california
which
says
the
same
turning
with
a
man
--
man
has
been
acquitted
for
convicted
particularly
if
he
server
his
sentence,
particularly
if
he
serve
his
sentence,
he
maybe
compelled
to
testify.
and
the
same
had
been
true
of
other
courts.
so
we
think
that
there
is
no
basis
in
the
--
in
the
history
or
the
theory,
the
principles
of
the
--
either
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
or
this
immunity
legislation
which
would
permit
a
distinction
to
be
made
between
a
petitioner
like
reina
here
or
a
defend
--
or
a
petitioner
like
ullmann
in
the
ullmann
case
or
brown
in
brown
against
walker.
they
stand
we
think
on
the
--
on
the
same
basis.
i
think
i
have
nothing
further.
