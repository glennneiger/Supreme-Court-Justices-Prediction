do
you
also
say
it's
unconstitutional
even
if
it
could
be
construed
that
way?

constitutional
problem
to
both
statutes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
you
go
on
to
this
branch
here,
are
you
--
does
the
statute
here,
the
immunity
statute
here,
in
its
wording,
differ
in
any
substantial
respect
from
the
statute
that
we
have
in
the
ullmann
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
there's
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
as
we
held
in
ullmann
as
we
did
that
the
statute
did
reach
for
state
immunity.
you
don't
--
whether
argue
that
we
shouldn't
reach
the
same
result
here
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
then
goes
to
the
power
of
congress
to
do
that
rather
than
to
what
it
--
what
the
statute
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand.
but
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
i
will
take
it
that
you
do
not
contend
that
the
statute
can
be
read.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
can
be
read
as
conferring
to
state
immunity.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
just
asking
about
argument
so
that
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
there's
really
no
bone
of
contention
between
you
and
the
government
that
the
statute
does
purport
--
purport
to
grant
immunity
for
the
state
prosecutions.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood
the
government
to
say
that
they
read
the
order
as
the
meaning
and
the
purge
period
will
be
--
begin
to
run
in
the
times
of
judgment
of
this
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
curious
as
to
whether
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
bypass
this
argument,
this
question
--
did
you
argue
--
the
government
argued
there?
