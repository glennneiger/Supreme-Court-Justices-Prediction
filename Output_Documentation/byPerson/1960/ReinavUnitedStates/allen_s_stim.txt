mr.
allen
s.
stim
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
this
court.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
affirmed
a
judgment
dated
and
entered
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
dated
the
2nd
day
of
february,
1959
by
which
this
petitioner
was
adjudged
guilty
of
a
contempt
of
court
for
his
refusal
to
testify
as
ordered
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406
which
is
known
under
the
popular
name
as
the
immunity
act
--
as
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956.
in
this
argument,
i
shall
use
both
the
code
name
and
the
popular
name
--
name
interchangeably.
by
the
terms
of
this
judgment,
adjudging
the
petitioner
in
contempt
of
court,
he
was
sentenced
to
a
term
of
two
years
imprisonment.
this
term
of
imprisonment
that
commenced
at
the
termination
of
a
narrowly,
a
five-year
federal
sentence
that
this
petitioner
was
then
serving.
this
judgment,
by
its
terms,
provided
that
the
petitioner
might
purge
himself
within
a
period
of
60
days
from
the
date
of
the
judgment
and
in
that
event
that
this
sentence,
by
its
--
its
terms
would
be
--
be
vacated
and
become
null
and
void.
this
60-day
purge
period
has
elapsed
without
the
petitioner
having
availed
himself
to
its
provisions
and
the
judgment
by
its
terms
had
become
final.
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
petitioner
is
presently
freed
--
free
on
$10,000
bails
--
bail
--
dollars
bail,
allowed
by
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court.
the
questions
being
raised
on
this
writ
of
certiorari
are
four
questions.
they
are
first,
does
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956
grant
immunity
from
state
prosecutions
for
violations
of
state
narcotic
laws?
and
in
the
event
that
this
court
holds
that
this
federal
statute
does
not
grant
such
an
immunity,
the
question
is,
is
the
immunity
granted
by
the
federal
statute
coextensive
with
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self
--
self-incrimination
which
it
seeks
to
replace?
the
second
part
of
this
question
calls
for
reexamination
by
this
court
of
the
1931
decision
of
united
states
against
murdock,
cited
284
u.s.
141,
with
my
contention
that
the
murdock
case
should
be
overruled.
my
second
question
raised
is
that
on
the
facts
of
this
particular
proceeding,
before
the
petitioner
could
be
validly
held
in
contempt
for
refusal
to
testify
as
ordered
pursuant
to
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956,
was
it
incumbent
--
was
it
not
incumbent
upon
the
government
to
have
made
--
tendered
this
petitioner
before
he
testified
a
firm
offer
or
commitment
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
render
inoperative,
the
unexecuted
portions
of
an
earlier
judgment
of
conviction
entered
in
the
united
states
district
--
district
court
which
adjudged
this
petitioner
guilty
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
violate
the
narcotic
laws
of
the
united
states
and
under
the
terms
of
which
judgment,
the
petitioner
was
then
serving
and
as
yet,
unexpired
five-year
prison
sentence
and
owed
the
government
a
$10,000
fine
which
he
has
been
unable
to
pay
which
were
imposed
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
the
earlier
judgment
of
conviction
when
the
said
prior
judgment
of
conviction
for
conspiracy
to
violate
the
narcotic
laws
of
the
united
states,
was
based
upon
the
same
facts
that
the
government
sought
to
question
this
petitioner
about
before
a
grand
jury
in
the
present
proceeding
pursuant
to
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406?
my
third
question
which
relates
to
question
number
one,
point
1
is,
was
this
petitioner
denied
due
process
of
law
by
the
failure
of
the
district
court
to
inform
him
as
to
the
scope
and
extent
of
the
immunity
granted
pursuant
to
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406
before
it
adjudged
the
petitioner
to
be
in
contempt
of
court
for
his
failure
to
testify
pursuant
to
said
provisions?
well,
my
fourth
and
final
question
is
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
was
the
sentence
of
this
petitioner
to
a
five-year
prison
term
on
this
present
contempt
proceeding
--
to
a
two-year
prison
term,
i
mean,
which
sentence
was
to
commence
at
the
termination
of
the
earlier
five-year
sentence
that
petitioner
was
then
serving
an
abuse
of
discretion
that
will
be
reviewed
by
this
court
--
by
this
court?
i
believe
that
at
this
point,
a
statement
of
facts
is
in
order.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
that
--
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
solicitor
general's
point,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
point
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
in
the
event
that
the
court
finds
that
this
--
that
this
statute
grants
immunity
from
--
from
state
--
that
this
act
grants
immunity
from
state
prosecution,
i
don't
believe
that
i
would
have
much
to
rely
on
in
my
first
point.
i
have
to
rely
then
on
the
other
points
in
the
argument.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes,
your
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
in
short,
the
government
is
attempting
to
bypass
the
murdock
case
by
raising
for
the
first
time,
before
this
court,
the
unique
position
with
regard
to
the
narcotic
control
act,
i
should
state.
they're
attempting
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
the
ullmann
decision.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i'm
arguing
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
court,
taking
into
consideration
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
the
ullmann
decision
and
the
immunity
act
of
1954
that
the
court
cannot
make
such
a
decision.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
that
--
that
i
go
along
with.
this
case
originated
in
the
united
states
district
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i'm
relying
on
both
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
my
position
is
--
is
that
i
don't
like
--
i'm
--
i'm
relying
on
the
constitutional
grounds
with
that
--
that
portion
--
on
--
on
that
portion,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
in
short
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
--
i
reject
that
position
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
--
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i
state,
yes,
that
--
that
there's
violation
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
as
a
violation
of
this
petitioner's
constitutional
rights,
your
honor.
this
case
originated
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
arose
out
of
a
proceeding
brought
by
the
government
pursuant
to
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406.
on
december
5th,
1958,
this
petitioner
was
imprisoned
in
a
federal
prison
where
he
was
then
serving
a
five-year
prison
sentence
and
owed
a
--
was
owing
the
government
a
fine
of
10
--
$10,000
which
he
had
been
unable
to
pay,
which
sentence
was
imposed
pursuant
to
the
terms
of
an
earlier
federal
conviction
adjudging
him
guilty
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
violate
the
narcotic
laws
of
the
united
states.
on
that
date,
december
5th,
1958,
this
petitioner
was
brought
before
a
federal
grand
jury
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
pursuant
to
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
test
--
test
of
a
condemn
where
he
was
asked
numerous
questions,
many
of
which
related
to
narcotics.
the
petitioner
refused
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
invoking
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
thereafter
and
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
--
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
putting
it
this
way,
the
facts
--
most
of
the
--
many
of
the
questions
--
the
facts
related
directly
to
the
crime
that
he
was
convicted
of
and
i
might
state
without
fear
of
contradiction
that
the
phraseology
of
many
of
those
questions
was
taken
from
the
testimony
given
against
this
--
this
petitioner
in
the
--
in
the
trial
in
the
--
in
the
district
court
on
the
charge
for
conspiracy
to
violate
the
narcotic
laws
of
the
united
states.
thereafter,
in
accordance
after
the
petitioner
refused
to
testify
before
the
federal
grand
jury,
the
government
applied
for
and
obtained
an
order
pursuant
to
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406.
that
is
the
court
order
of
december
17th,
1958,
which
appears
in
the
record
pages
10
and
11.
this
order
directed
the
petitioner,
in
its
language,
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
title
18,
section
1406.
the
petitioner
was
again
called
before
the
grand
jury
after
this
order
had
been
signed
and
was
again
asked
the
same
questions.
he
again
--
he
--
this
second
time,
he
stood
mute
on
his
--
on
his
constitutional
rights
and
it
was
upon
his
continued
refusal
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury
on
the
claim
of
constitutional
immunity
that
the
government
brought
this
motion
to
punish
the
petitioner
for
contempt
of
court.
this
--
the
--
this
present
proceeding
to
punish
the
petitioner
for
contempt
of
court
was
brought
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
title
18,
u.s.c.,
section
401,
subdivision
3,
to
punish
the
petitioner
for
disobedience
to
a
lawful
order
of
the
court.
the
government's
motion
to
punish
for
contempt
came
on
for
hearing
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
on
this
22nd
day
of
january,
1959
before
the
honorable
archie
o.
dawson,
district
judge.
on
this
hearing,
the
petitioner
opposed
the
government's
motion
on
two
different
grounds.
the
first
ground
being
that
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406
is
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
it
does
not
provide
the
broad
immunity
contemplated
by
said
two
amendments.
i
believe
this
appears
in
transcript
record
--
pages
20
and
21
of
the
record.
the
petitioner's
then
counsel
argued
that
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
in
the
immunity
statute,
the
scope
and
the
extent
of
the
immunity
jurisdiction
of
the
immunity
grant
and
jurisdictions
other
than
the
federal
jurisdiction.
and
more
particularly,
he
referred
to
the
state
jurisdictions.
the
petitioner's
then
counsel
cited
this
statute
as
an
example
of
the
constant
attempts
to
chip
away
the
basic
liberties
guaranteed
under
the
constitution.
the
petitioner's
second
ground
which
is
not
being
urged
before
this
court
is
that
certain
questions
propounded
to
the
petitioner
before
the
grand
jury
were
not
within
the
context
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute
as
enacted.
as
i've
stated,
i'm
not
urging
the
--
the
second
point
before
the
court.
thereafter
and
on
the
2nd
day
of
december
--
of
february,
1959,
the
district
court
rendered
an
opinion
--
an
opinion
and
judgment,
adjudging
the
petitioner
to
be
in
contempt
of
court.
i
believe
that
the
opinion
was
rendered
on
january
29th,
1959
and
that
there
was
some
question
before
the
court
whether
they
had
entered
a
judgment
or
not,
therefore,
the
judgments
was
entered,
i
believe,
the
monday
--
monday
but
both
the
opinion
and
judgment
are
considered
to
go
together.
this
opinion
which
is
officially
cited
in
giacomo
reina,
170
f.
supp.292,
appears
on
pages
29
through
34
of
the
record.
in
this
opinion,
judge
dawson
followed
the
rationale
of
this
--
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
murdock
and
held
that
he
was
bound
by
the
decision.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
unanimously
affirmed
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
on
december
30th,
1959.
this
affirmance
appears
in
the
transcript,
pages
38
through
40.
it's
officially
recorded
as
giacomo
reina
against
the
united
states,
273
f.2d
2
--
234.
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
followed
the
murdock
decision.
this
brings
me
to
my
first
point.
in
answer
to
the
first
question
raised
and
to
set
forth
in
point
1
of
my
brief,
my
contention
is
that
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956
does
not
grant
immunity
from
state
prosecutions
for
narcotic
violations
of
state
laws.
and
that
therefore,
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956
is
not
coextensive
with
the
constitutional
privilege
that
it
seeks
to
replace,
that
is
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
guaranteed
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
petitioner
contends
that
despite
the
wording
in
the
act
which
uses
the
language,
"nor
shall
testimony
so
compelled
be
used
as
evidence
in
any
criminal
proceeding
against
him
in
any
court,
that
said
statute,
cannot
by
its
terms
under
a
grant
of
immunity,
bar
states
from
prosecuting
for
violations
of
state
penal
laws
involving
narcotics
which
are
--
and
exercised
by
the
states
of
their
police
power.
as
any
such
attempt
by
congress
to
grant
such
an
immunity
from
state
prosecutions,
would
be
an
invasion
of
the
powers
expressly
reserved
to
the
states
under
the
tenth
amendment."
this
fact
was
recognized
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
tedesco
against
the
united
states,
255
f.2d
35,
which
cases
cited
in
my
brief.
in
the
tedesco
case,
the
sixth
circuit,
while
affirming
a
contempt
conviction
arising
under
this
very
same
statute,
went
on
to
state
on
the
ground
that
it
felt
bound
by
the
murdock
decision,
the
sixth
circuit
went
on
to
express
grave
doubt
that
congress
has
the
power
to
grant
immunity
from
prosecutions
in
state
courts
pursuant
to
state
narcotic
laws.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
no,
that
doesn't
mean
in
my
opinion.
i
was
just
citing
the
tedesco
case
which,
in
tedesco,
they
held
that
they
were
bound
by
murdock.
there
could
be,
in
certain
circumstances
which
i'll
come
to,
valid
immunity
legislation
given
by
the
federal
government
binding
--
binding
the
states
also.
i
--
i
intend
in
my
argument
to
distinguish
the
field,
say,
narcotics
from
the
field
of
national
defense,
which
--
the
only
case
involved.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
to
be
quite
frank
with
your
honor,
as
i
was
going
to
state
in
my
argument,
i
believe
that
the
statute,
the
immunity
act
of
1954
served
as
the
original
blueprint
for
the
--
for
the
drawing
up
of
the
present
statute.
this
statute
was
enacted,
i
believe,
about
three
months
after
this
court
sustained
the
ullmann
case.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i
--
my
point
is
despite
the
language,
the
ullmann
case
happened
to
refer
to
certain
powers
in
the
federal
government,
which
i
believe,
are
conceded
to
be
supreme
over
the
state's
national
defense
which
is
relied,
closely
relied
to
the
war
powers.
the
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
no.
i'm
differentiating
in
my
argument
between
the
power
of
congress
in
enacting
legislation
that
might
bind
the
states
where
this
power
is
being
exercised
in
the
national
defense
or
war
power
situation
from
a
case
like
the
narcotic
--
in
the
narcotic
field
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
--
which
traditionally
was
exercised
by
both
governments
concurrently.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i'm
not
arguing
anything
about
the
language,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
there's
no
--
there's
been
no
position
taken
down
below
by
a
--
by
the
government
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
--
on
the
statutory
language.
they
just
say,
"murdock,
we
follow

there's
no

no
attempt
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
no,
i
don't
claim
it
does.
i
claim
that
the
statute
uses
the
language
in
any
court
which
was
likewise
used
in
the
--
used
in
the
immunity
act
of
1954,
as
i
will
come
in
one
moment.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
as
in
murdock
or
ullmann,
it
hasn't
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
my
question
is
at
the
time
that
the
--
the
ullmann
statute,
the
immunity
act
of
1954
was
enacted
by
congress.
the
reading
of
the
congressional
reports
shows
that
apparently,
congress
didn't
have
too
much
of
an
intent
one
way
or
the
other,
their
intent
being
that
if
we
could
get
state
immunity
well
and
dandy,
we'll
leave
that
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
to
construe.
that
appears
in
my
brief.
congress,
in
enacting
federal
immunity
legislation,
has
recognized
the
powers
involved
and
the
questions
of
constitutionality
that
would
arise
out
of
a
federal
--
federal
immunity
legislation
that
might
be
construed
as
barring
state
prosections
for
violations
of
state
penal
laws.
this
point,
i
came
to
the
part
of
my
arguments
where
i
dealt
with
the
congressional
intent
in
the
ullmann
statute.
he
has
report
on
the
bill
that
was
subsequently
enacted
into
law
and
is
now
known
as
the
immunity
act
of
1954
that
is
18
u.s.c.,
section
3486
supp.2,
as
reported
in
two
congressional
codes
and
congress
reports,
83rd
congress,
second
session,
1954
on
pages
3063
and
following.
this
majority
--
the
majority
report
which
recommended
passage
of
the
then
proposed
bill,
expressed
great
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
congress
under
the
proposed
grant
of
immunity
which
referred
to
compel
testimony
in
matters
concerning
national
security.
this
majority
report
expressed
great
doubt
in
that
field
of
the
power
of
congress
to
bar
subsequent
action
in
--
in
the
states
in
enforcing
their
criminal
laws.
however,
this
majority
report
recommended
passage
of
the
then
proposed
bill
leaving
the
question
as
scope
and
extent
of
the
immunity
granted
and
constitutionality
of
the
act
up
to
this
court.
the
house
minority
report,
which
appears
in
page
3071
of
the
aforementioned
code
in
congressional
reports,
considered
that
the
proposed
act
construed
to
grant
immunity
from
state
prosecutions,
was
an
unwarranted
intrusion
by
the
federal
government
into
state
prosecutions
which
must
therefore
fail
to
lack
of
broadness,
consonant
with
the
fifth
amendment.
this
immunity
act,
as
i
have
already
stated,
served
as
the
model
for
the
drafting
of
the
present
statute
under
discussion,
which
was
enacted
approximately
two
years
later
and
approximately
three
months
after
the
immunity
act
of
1954
was
construed
as
constitutional.
in
ullmann
against
the
united
states,
he
was
--
350
--
350
u.s.
422.
the
immunity
act
of
1954,
however,
concerned
investigations
relating
to
the
interference
with
or
endangering
of
the
national
security
or
defense
of
the
united
states
and
its
subject
matter
is
readily
--
readily
distinguishable
from
the
subject
matter
of
this
act,
which
by
its
terms,
involves
investigations
into
violations
of
the
narcotic
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
ullmann
against
the
united
states,
the
constitutionality
of
the
immunity
act
of
1954
was
upheld
and
the
phrase
in
any
court
contained
in
that
act
and
in
the
present
--
contained
in
the
ullmann
act,
was
construed
as
granting
immunity
from
both
federal
and
state
prosecutions.
as
i've
stated
before,
the
same
language
is
used
in
the
present
act.
the
ullmann
case,
however,
turned
upon
a
paramount
power
or
authority
of
congress
to
safeguard
the
national
security.
this
power
is
closely
related
to
the
war
power,
both
of
which
powers
under
the
constitution,
delegate
the
authority
solely
in
congress
or
the
federal
government,
its
own
responsibility
to
preserve
the
continued
existence
of
a
free
and
independent
united
states
and
its
constituent
states
without
any
bar,
delay
or
hindrance
on
the
part
of
the
respective
states.
while
not
mentioned
in
the
ullmann
decision,
this
paramount
power
of
the
federal
government
and
this
field
is,
i
believe,
underscored
by
article
i,
section
10,
clause
3
of
the
constitution,
which
is
an
interdiction
on
the
states
from
engaging
in
war
without
the
consent
of
congress,
unless
actually
invaded
or
in
such
eminent
danger
as
will
not
admit
of
delay.
on
this
argument,
for
the
first
time,
the
justice
department
has
taken
the
position
that
is
in
point
1
of
their
brief
that
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406
grants
immunity
from
both
state
as
well
as
federal
prosecutions.
all
of
the
prior
cases
involving
violations
of
this
statute
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
tedesco
case,
which
i've
previously
cited,
studiously
avoid
discussion
as
to
the
scope
or
extent
of
the
immunity
granted
referring
to
rely
solely
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
murdock
against
the
united
states.
and
as
i've
stated,
the
government
likewise
below
in
the
lower
courts
in
applying
this
statute,
followed
the
same
position
as
the
courts
did.
the
position
now
being
taken
by
the
justice
department
on
--
on
this
appeal
that
immunity
is
also
granted
from
state
prosecution
is
merely
an
attempt
by
the
justice
department
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
ullmann.
the
government
confers
on
page
20
of
its
brief
that
in
every
case
where
congress
is
acting
in
the
exercise
of
federal
power
which
in
the
present
case
involves
taxation
and
the
control
of
the
importation
of
narcotics,
that
in
such
cases,
congress
has
the
power
to
impose
restrictions
but
it
bar
the
states
from
exercising
the
powers
reserved
to
them
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
by
--
by
means
of
statutory
enactment
such
as
the
present
act
now
under
discussion.
in
support
of
this
contention,
the
cases
of
ullmann
against
the
united
states
and
adams
against
maryland
are
cited.
i
believe
i've
distinguished
the
ullmann
case
in
this
argument
while
adams
against
maryland
simplified,
i
think,
to
its
basic
extreme,
involved
in
my
opinion
the
question
of
the
admissibility
of
certain
compelled
evidence
in
the
state
courts,
not
the
question
--
not
the
substantive
question
of
immunity
from
prosecution.
to
follow
the
government's
position
in
support
of
an
extension
of
the
--
of
the
ullmann
doctrine
to
its
logical
conclusion
would
be,
in
my
opinion,
to
sound
the
death
knell
to
the
--
to
the
rights
and
powers
guaranteed
to
the
states
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
would,
in
effect,
be
repealed
of
the
said
tenth
amendment
by
judicial
decision.
could
anyone
seriously
argue
that
the
federal
government,
in
the
exercise
of
a
conceded
federal
power,
take,
for
example,
the
power
to
levy
the
federal
income
tax,
could
anyone
seriously
argue
that
in
the
exercise
of
that
power,
that
congress
could
enact
an
immunity
statute
similar
to
the
one
now
under
discussion,
granting
witness's
immunity
for
such
state
crimes
such
as
murder,
extortion,
robbery
and
the
like?
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
solicitor
general
reasonably
argued
that
under
the
provisions
of
the
particular
statute
now
under
discussion,
that
the
government
could
grant
immunity
for
murder,
extortion
and
robbery
that
might
be
disclosed
in
a
narcotic
investigation.
considering
the
vast
expansion
in
recent
years
of
the
regulatory
functions
of
various
federal
government
agencies,
wherein
the
government
--
where
the
federal
government
now
regulates
such
diverse
fields
as
taking
of
migratory
game
birds
under
title
16,
united
states
code,
section
703,
the
regulation
such
as
the
branding
of
foods
under
the
federal
foods
and
drug
act,
such
a
theory
is
urged
by
the
government
for
extending
the
scope
of
the
ullmann
decision,
would
leave
the
states
with
no
powers
of
their
own,
say,
of
those
granted
or
delegated
to
them
by
the
federal
government.
it
is
respectfully
submitted
that
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
does
not
and
cannot
grant
immunity
from
state
prosecutions
for
violations
of
state
narcotic
laws.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i
have
urged
in
my
third
point
in
this
argument.
i
believe
that
i
have
urged
the
point
that
assuming
that
this
court,
in
rendering
a
decision
in
this
case,
does
not
--
does
not
particularly
go
along
with
the
points
raised
in
my
first
point,
but
however,
in
the
event
that
this
court
clarifies
or
--
clarifies
the
law
from
what
it
was
at
the
time
that
the
hearing
and
judgment
were
rendered
that
in
that
case
that
this
judgment
still
must
prevail
and
the
matter
must
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
proceedings
and
conformity
with
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i've
cited
some
cases.
i've
cited
new
york
cases
and
i
believe
that
this
raleigh
case,
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
and
its
point
is
also
--
is
also
in
point
there.
in
other
words,
in
the
brea
case,
i
think
that
was
a
new
york
state
case,
the
conviction
in
that
case
was
also
affirmed
by
the
court.
the
new
york
court,
in
rendering
its
decision,
stated
that
it
was
improper
conduct
for
--
that
they
prosecuted
before
the
grand
jury
to
--
and
i
think
the
statement
in
that
case
was
improper
conduct
for
the
prosecutor
to
give
a
witness
an
incorrect
idea
of
the
--
of
what
the
existence
of
the
law
was.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
the
district
court
--
the
district
judge
didn't
--
did
not
do
anything
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
district
judge
relied
on
what
he
considers
controlling
case
law
or
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
murdock
case.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes.
in
other
words,
the
district
court
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
that
--
that's
correct.
the
district
court
didn't
consider
anything
about
state
prosecution.
in
other
words,
they
had
no
way
of
understanding
what
the
correct
status
of
the
law
themselves.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
no.
my
position
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
my
position
is
that
that
this
man
should
be
given
a
chance,
given
full
knowledge
of
his
rights
there
not
to
go
up
a
blind
alley.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
the
60-day
provision
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
the
60-day
provision,
this
man
goes
to
jail,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
provision
on
that
judgment
is
clear
and
unambiguous
there.
i'm
just
checking
on
what
page
it
appears.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
in
other
words
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
according
to
the
expressed
language
in
the
judgment
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i've
checked
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
if
i
assume
that,
i'm
not
assuming
that
i
have
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
i
may
not
protest
down
below,
was
that
there
was
no
immunity
in
this
state
that
the
statute
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
apparently,
judge
dawson
in
--
in
his
opinion
as
cited
in
his
opinion
and
in
his
judgment,
puts
us
--
puts
us
in
the
predicament
of
relying
on
the
language
of
the
judgment
and
opinion.
and
according
to
the
terms
of
both,
judge
dawson
recognized
that
maybe
reina
raised
this
procedural
device
down
below
where
the
hearing
came
up
and
all
that
in
reliance
or
seeking
to
--
to
obtain
a
judicial
determination.
but
it
--
it's
quite
obvious
that
judge
dawson's
opinion
is
that
once
he
ruled
in
the
matter,
the
judgment
and
the
terms
became
final.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
the
only
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
according
to
the
rationale
of
this
court
and
i
think
your
honors'
decision
in
knapp
against
schweitzer,
if
my
man
would've
done
anything
in
the
court
below,
it
would've
been
just
too
bad
for
him.
the
only
--
the
only
alternative
that
my
man
has
of
protecting
his
right
is
to
refuse
to
testify
and
present
the
matter
to
the
courts.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
yes,
you're
not
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
we
were
mislead
to
this
effect
that
we
were
--
my
petitioner
was
a
layman
and
who
was
represented
at
the
hearing.
had
an
order
--
they
have
an
--
there
--
there
is
an
order
in
this
case,
i
think
it
appears,
the
order
of
judge
weinfeld,
where
this
man,
a
layman,
is
ordered
subject
to
the
provisions
of
title
18,
united
states
code,
section
1406
as
amended
that
giacomo
reina
--
and
hereby
is
instructed
to
answer
the
questions
propounded
in
before
the
grand
jury
and
to
testify
and
produce
evidence
with
respect
to
such
matters
under
inquiry
before
the
grand
jury.
now,
i'd
like
to
ask
your
honor
to
a
mere
layman,
what
would
that
mean?
and
then
again,
if
--
as
--
realizing
that
he
is
represented
by
an
attorney
at
the
hearing,
how
could
the
attorney
give
this
layman
any
intelligent
advice
when
the
matter
--
apparently,
the
matter
is
so
confused
or
up
in
the
air
that
it
requires
a
final
determination
of
this
court
to
settle
the
question?
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
he
was
certainly
--
the
only
thing
that
protected
my
man
from
going
to
jail
was
the
fact
that
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court
granted
him
bail.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
it
is
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
what?
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
it
was
so
real
and
appreciable,
the
danger
of
his
going
to
prison
that
the
--
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
refused
to
continue
him
on
bail,
pending
application
for
certiorari.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
that
would
call
on
a
rely
--
on
a
ruling
by
this
court,
not
a
statement
by
the
solicitor
general
that
the
immunity
granted
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
in
case
you
disagree
on
this,
i'm
urging
my
other
points,
my
--
my
second
point,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes.
well,
that's
how
they
read
the
order,
your
honor.
that's
a
little
different
from
what
the
records
shows
though.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
--
then
i
don't
--
mr.
allen
s.
stim
yes,
your
honor.
that's
my
point.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
that
is
my
position
at
the
present
time,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
my
--
as
i
stated,
the
second
part
of
that
--
my
--
my
first
point
is
that
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
--
if
this
court
holds
that
the
immunity
provision
of
the
narcotic
control
act
grants
immunity
from
federal
prosecution
only
and
does
not
grant
immunity
from
prosecution
by
the
states
for
violations
of
state
laws,
and
i
believe
that
this
is
the
only
logical
construction
consistent
with
the
constitution,
that
in
this
event,
that
this
court
should
overrule
its
earlier
decision
in
united
states
against
murdock.
the
case
relied
on
by
the
courts
below
and
adjudging
this
petitioner
to
be
in
contempt
of
court
for
refusal
to
testify
pursuant
to
title
18
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1406.
the
murdock
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1931
did
not
involve
an
immunity
statute
but
involved
a
prosecution
of
the
taxpayer,
murdock,
for
his
refusal
to
testimony
--
to
give
testimony
and
to
supply
information
for
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
for
deductions
claimed
in
his
1927
or
1928
federal
income
tax
returns,
for
moneys
allegedly
paid
to
other
persons.
this
was
an
indictable
misdemeanor
under
the
then
title
26
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1265
and
1114.
murdock
interposed
a
special
plea
to
this
indictment
that
if
the
questions
he
answered
--
that
--
that
he
answered
the
various
questions
propounded
to
him
before
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
that
he
would've
been
compelled
to
become
a
witness
against
himself
and
caused
to
be
subject
to
prosecution
for
violations
of
various
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
fact
was
that
at
the
time
murdock
invoked
his
privilege
against
self-incrimination
before
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue,
his
counsel
stated
that
murdock
had
in
mind
violations
of
the
state
law,
not
of
the
federal
laws.
this
court,
in
284
u.s.
141,
set
aside
the
special
plea
holding
that
investigations
for
federal
purposes
may
not
be
prevented
by
matters
dependent
on
state
laws.
this
holding
was
construed
by
this
court
the
second
time
murdock
came
before
it,
290
u.s.
389,
as
definitely
settling
for
the
first
time
the
proposition
of
law
that
one
under
examination
in
a
federal
tribunal
may
not
refuse
to
answer
on
account
of
probable
incrimination
under
the
state
law.
the
murdock
case,
as
your
honors
are
well
aware,
has
been
severely
criticized
as
being
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
the
english
common
law
as
being
inconsistent
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
as
being
destructive
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
guaranteed
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
i
agree
with
these
criticisms
and
in
my
opinion,
the
murdock
case
was
an
unfortunate
decision
in
the
field
of
constitutional
law.
in
the
murdock
case,
this
court
adopted
what
it
called
the
english
rule
that
the
common
law
of
privilege
exempting
witnesses
from
answering
questions
that
would
tend
to
incriminate
them
does
not
protect
them
against
disclosing
offenses
and
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
foreign
country.
as
i
have
set
forth
in
point
1
(b)
of
my
brief,
first,
there
is
no
such
english
rule
as
was
enunciated
by
this
court
in
murdock.
and
secondly,
in
this
country,
the
respective
states
which
had
domestic
jurisdictions
within
the
--
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
do
not
quite
fit
the
term
in
other
country
as
was
used
in
the
english
cases.
two
english
cases
that
were
cited
in
murdock
are
two
sicilies
against
willcox
and
regina
against
boyes.
these
cases
are
cited
and
discussed
on
pages
21
and
22
of
my
brief.
and
to
take
some
mere
reading
of
them
to
show
that
they
do
not
stand
for
any
such
rule
of
law
set
forth
in
murdock,
two
sicilies,
which
was
decided
in
the
year
1850,
involved
--
involved
the
claim
of
privilege
in
both
by
a
witness
at
a
trial
and
a
discovery
proceeding
in
an
english
court
where
the
witnesses,
who
were
agents
of
a
revolutionary
government
in
sicily,
claimed
before
the
english
court
that
if
they
were
required
to
testify
that
their
answers
might
subject
them
to
the
penal
laws
of
sicily.
the
english
court
rejected
this
claim
of
privilege
and
after
first
stating
its
ignorance
of
sicilian
law
and
the
fact
that
the
english
court
had
enough
of
a
problem
understanding
the
law
of
its
own
jurisdiction
without
being
expected
to
understand
the
lower
foreign
jurisdictions,
the
court
went
on
to
state
in
that
case,
in
its
decision,
"it
is
to
be
observed
that
in
such
a
case,
in
order
to
make
the
disclosures
dangerous
to
the
party
who
objects,
it
is
essential
that
he
should
first
quit
the
protection
of
our
laws
and
willfully
go
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
laws
he
has
violated."
i
don't
think
it
takes
any
extended
discussion
to
differentiate
the
two
sicilies
case
from
the
problem
that
this
petitioner
faces.
the
other
english
case
cited,
regina
against
boyes
states
what
i
consider
as
the
correct
rule
as
to
the
extent
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
regina
against
boyes,
decided
in
1861,
involved
a
claim
of
privilege
invoked
by
a
witness
at
a
trial
and
at
a
--
an
election
bribery
case.
despite
the
fact
that
at
the
trial,
the
witness
was
offered
and
he
accepted
a
pardon,
a
royal
pardon
under
the
great
seal.
despite
the
offer
and
acceptance
of
the
pardon,
this
witness
persisted
in
his
claim
of
privilege
stating
that
despite
the
pardon,
he
was
still
subject
to
possible
impeachment
by
commons
which
was
not
covered
by
the
pardon
and
that
therefore,
he
should
be
entitled
to
invoke
his
privilege.
king's
bench,
in
ruling
against
the
claim
of
privilege
stated,
and
i
quote,
"further
than
this,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
danger
to
be
apprehended
must
be
real
and
appreciable
with
reference
to
the
ordinary
operation
of
law
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things,
not
a
danger
of
an
imaginary
and
unsubstantial
character
having
reference
to
some
extraordinary
and
fairly
possible
contingency
so
improbable
that
no
reasonable
man
would
separate
to
influence
his
conduct."
the
court
further
stated,
"but
it
would
be
to
convert
to
a
salutary
protection
into
a
means
of
abuse
if
it
would
be
held
that
a
mere
imaginary
possibility
of
danger,
however
remote
and
improbable,
was
sufficient
to
justify
the
withholding
of
evidence
essential
to
ends
of
justice."
in
regina
against
boyes,
the
court
ruled
against
the
privilege
--
claim
of
privilege
stating
that
the
witness's
fear
of
impeachment
despite
the
pardon
was
in
its
words,
ridiculous
and
unreasonable
as
any
impeachment
of
the
witness
would
be
contrary
to
custom
and
to
law.
both
of
the
aforementioned
cases
and
subsequent
english
cases
turn
on
the
question
of
the
danger
of
the
witness,
was
it
real
and
appreciable?
if
the
fear
was
unrealistic
or
imaginary,
the
claim
of
privilege
was
denied.
if
it
was
recognized
by
the
court
as
reasonable
or
realistic,
it
was
recognized.
that
--
such
is
the
rule
of
the
english
cases
and
has
been
in
the
past
and
still
is
as
amply
demonstrated
by
the
cases
of

the
united

against
mcrae,
which
was
an
english
case,
decided
subsequent
to
the
decisions
in
two
sicilies
against
willcox
and
regina
against
boyes,
the
claim
of
privilege
or
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
was
recognized
by
the
english
court
despite
the
fact
that
the
fines,
forfeitures
and
penalties
were
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
a
jurisdiction
far
into
that
of
the
english
court.
this
law
--
that
this
rule
is
still
the
law
of
england
and
the
test
being
that
whether
the
danger
was
real
and
appreciable,
i
referred
the
court
to
ex
parte
reynolds,
20
ch.
d.
294,
where
the
rule
was
reaffirmed
and
restated.
the
murdock
case
cited
as
further
authority
for
its
holding,
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
these
prior
decisions
are
cited
in
murdock,
has
authority
to
sustain
the
proposition
set
forth
in
that
case.
the
case
of
counselman
against
hitchcock,
142
u.s.
4
--
547,
which
is
an
old
standby
and
is
now
one
book
law
and
decided
both
pro
and
con
in
all
--
in
all
litigation
involving
the
construction
of
immunity
legislation,
does
not
stand
for
any
such
proposition
as
enunciated
in
murdock.
in
that
case
which
involved
the
constitutionality
of
the
old
interstate
commerce
act
with
regard
to
its
provision
for
the
compulsion
of
testimony,
no
question
was
raised
as
the
applicability
of
the
act
to
state
jurisdictions.
the
court,
in
that
landmark
decision,
only
stated
what
has
now
become
the
established
rule
that
a
statue
which
leaves
a
party
or
witness
subject
to
prosecution
after
he
answers
the
criminating
questions
put
to
him
and
that's
the
plan,
the
privilege
conferred
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
other
cases
cited
in
united
states
against
murdock,
which
touched
on
the
issue
involved,
likewise
apply
the
test
of
whether
or
not
the
danger
to
the
witness
was
real
and
--
and
appreciable.
brown
against
walker,
161
u.s.
591,
the
case
cited
in
united
states
against
murdock
and
it
successors,
had
the
original
authority
for
the
murdock
rule,
dealt
with
the
amended
interstate
commerce
act
toward
the
act
of
february
11th,
1893
which
was
the
successor
to
the
act
struck
down
by
this
court
in
counselman
against
hitchcock.
the
act
of
february
11th,
1893
substantially
provided
as
follows."
that
no
person
shall
be
subject
to
penalty
or
forfeiture
for
or
on
account
of
any
transaction
matter
or
thing
concerning
which
he
might
testify
in
obedience
to
a
subpoena
or
order."
this
provision
was
held
by
the
majority
opinion
of
the
court
in
brown
against
walker,
which
was
a
5-to-4
decision,
as
being
that
the
criminality
was
removed
by
statute
that
the
immunity
granted
was
coextensive
with
the
privilege
that
it
sought
to
replace.
well,
this
majority
opinion
inferred
that
the
immunity
granted
in
the
federal
act
was
operative
also
in
the
state
jurisdictions
for
crimes
committed
in
those
jurisdictions
under
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
clause.
a
careful
reading
of
this
majority
opinion,
discloses
that
the
majority
of
the
justices
deciding
that
case
went
on
the
test
set
forth
by
the
old
english
cases.
the
test
of
the
reality
or
the
danger
of
be
--
of
the
--
to
the
witness
being
real
and
appreciable.
the
minority
opinion
in
that
case
by
mr.
justice
shiras
did
not
consider
the
possibility
of
state
prosecution
as
being
a
fear
unsubstantial
and
remote
and
held
that
the
statute
was
thus
in
conflict
with
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
minority
opinion
also
asserted
that
as
congress
cannot
create
state
courts
nor
denounce
penalties
for
crimes
or
offenses
against
the
states,
so
it
cannot
proscribe
rules
for
proceedings
in
state
courts
and
that
therefore,
the
act
in
question
could
not
apply
to
the
states.
in
hale
against
henkel,
201
u.s.
43,
which
involved
the
proceeding
under
the
sherman
antitrust
act
and
likewise
involved
an
immunity
statute,
this
court
disposed
of
the
witness'
claim
in
that
case
of
probable
incrimination
under
state
law
as
being
--
following
the
language
of
the
english
cases
as
being
to
one
substantial
and
remote
to
impair
legal
immunity,
citing
brown
against
walker
and
jack
against
kansas.
jack
against
kansas,
which
involved
the
converse
of
the
present
case,
a
refusal
of
the
witness
to
testify
pursuant
to
a
state
immunity
statute
on
the
claim
that
the
statute
which
involved
the
fixing
of
coal
prices
might
--
did
not
confer
immunity
from
state
--
from
federal
prosecution
and
therefore,
violated
his
rights
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution.
in
that
case,
this
court
while
stating
that
it
thought
that
legal
immunity
is
in
regard
to
prosecutions
in
the
same
jurisdiction
where
the
immunity
is
granted
suffices,
the
court
based
its
decision
on
--
in
that
case
on
the
fact
that
it
considered
the
alleged
fear
of
the
witness
of
federal
prosecution
under
the
federal
antitrust
act
as
being
too
unsubstantial
and
remote
to
seriously
consider.
as
proof
--
as
proof
that
this
court
used
the
test
of
reasonableness
or
reality
of
the
witness's
apprehension
of
prosecution
in
the
aforementioned
case
--
cases,
i
cite
bollman
against
fagan,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
and
by
the
same
bench
that
decided
the
previous
cases
of
jack
against
kansas
and
hale
against
henkel.
in
bollman
against
fagan,
which
did
not
involve
an
immunity
statute,
the
witness
on
being
summoned
before
a
federal
grand
jury,
pursuant
to
an
investigation
i
understand
as
the
criminal
liability
of
an
employee
in
a
national
bank
where
certain
funds
were
missing,
the
witness
on
being
summoned
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
pursuant
to
subpoena
to
produce
certain
records,
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
before
said
grand
jury
using
the
following
language."
i
decline
to
answer
the
questions
contained
in
the
said
order
of
april
8th,
1905
on
the
ground
that
it
might
tend
to
criminate
me
and
in
this
connection,
i
produced
a
copy
of
a
petition
filed
against
me
and
others
by
a
manual
up
in
(inaudible)
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
hamilton
county.
and
i
state
that
there
are
many
other
actions
of
the
same
kind
pending
against
me.
this
petition
referred
to
by
the
witness
bollman
charged
him
and
others
with
a
scheme
of
gambling
known
as
bucket
shop
in
ohio,
which
was
criminal
conduct
in
ohio.
in
bollman
against
fagan,
this
court,
in
citing
the
earlier
opinion
of
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
in
1820,
in
united
states
versus
saline
bank
wherein
the
--
this
court
at
that
time,
held
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
exonerated
from
disclosing
offenses
in
violation
of
the
law
--
state
law
of
this
--
law
of
the
state
of
virginia.
this
court
in
bollman
against
fagan
followed
the
rationale
of
judge
marshall's
decision
and
held
that
bollman
was
exonerated
under
his
claim
of
privilege
from
disclosures
that
would've
exposed
him
to
penalties
under
the
state
laws
and
is
respectfully
submitted
that
all
of
the
aforementioned
decisions
of
this
court
up
until
murdock
against
the
united
states
are
consistent
and
that
they
apply
the
rules
set
forth
in
the
english
cases,
which
apply
the
test
of
the
danger
to
the
witness
being
real
and
appreciable.

commencing
with
murdock
against
the
united

and
knapp
against
schweitzer,
that
this
court,
in
deciding
the
applicability
of
the
constitutional
privilege
against
self-incrimination
has
abandoned
what
i
considered
the
tried
and
true
rule
of
the
english
cases.
that
this
petitioner
would
face
the
threat
of

state
prosecution
for
violations
of

laws
for
facts
adduced
before

grand
jury

notice

cited

harboring
as
mentioned
in
the
act,
practically
impossible
by
making
the
federal
registrations
available
to
state
authorities,
the
use
in
state
prosecutions.
it
is
only
reasonable
to
believe
that
the
--
that
a
similar
intent
is
behind
the
enactment
and
application
of
the
statute
now
under
discussion.
i
have
also
cited
that
conflict
between
the
states
that
follow
the
michigan
rule
and
--
and
this
court
in
the
murdock
decision.
i
likewise
cited
various
decisions
of
the
lower
court
such
as
marcello
against
the
united
states,
united
states
against
decarlo
and
the
like,
which
decisions,
although
came
lip
service
to
murdock,
ignore
it
in
practice.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgments
--
that
the
judgment
of
conviction
should
be
reversed
with
directions
to
the
lower
court
that
the
government's
motion
to
punish
for
contempt
should
be
denied.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
well,
from
the
facts,
your
honor,
i
understand
my
belief,
i
think
it
was
about
november
29th
of
last
year,
the
--
the
petitioner
completed
the
conspiracy
sentence
that
he
was
then
serving.
at
the
time
though
that
this
proceeding
took
place
and
at
the
time
of
entry
of
judgment,
i
believe
that
he
had
--
it
was
february
2nd,
1959
until
--
until
november
28th,
1960.
he
would
remain
in
prison
serving
the
earlier
sentence.
mr.
allen
s.
stim
he
has
been
unable
to
pay
the
fine
(inaudible)
mr.
allen
s.
stim
i
mean
he
--
i
understand,
he
had
to
(inaudible)
some
oath,
to
serve
30
additional
days
in
prison
regarding
the
(inaudible)
mr.
allen
s.
stim
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
this
particular
case
the
petitioner
giacomo
reina
had
been
convicted
of
the
crime
of
conspiracy
to
violate
the
narcotic
laws
of
the
united
states.
he
has
never
been
charged
or
convicted
of
the
substantive
crimes
from
which
he
has
been
convicted
of
conspiring
to
violate.
i
have
distinguished
the
facts
of
this
case
in
my
brief.
a
question
was
asked
yesterday
by
the
court
as
to
what
prejudice
there
would
be
to
the
petitioner
in
the
event
that
this
court
construed
the
purge
clause
of
the
judgment
as
running
from
the
date
of
final
determination
by
this
court
of
the
matter
now
before
the
court
instead
of
following
the
plain
language
of
the
judgment
which
commenced
the
purge
clause
as
of
february
2nd
in
1959
that
this
--
such
a
construction
would
create
more
problems
than
it
could
possibly
solve.
it's
apparent
from
the
record
of
the
court
and
i
refer
the
court
to
page
25,
24
of
the
transcript
of
the
record,
the
second
paragraph
down
the
second
statement
of
mr.
cobe
who
was
the
attorney
for
the
petition
at
below.
mr.
cobe
stated
toward
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph
that
the
order
which
this
petition
has
been
held
in
contempt
on
the
order
of
judge
edelstein
was
construed
by
judge
edelstein
that
the
petitioner
should
answer
all
questions
referred
to
one
before
the
grand
jury
including
those
which
might
not
appear
on
these
papers,
therefore,
even
assuming
that
this
court
would
construe
the
purge
clause
as
commencing
as
of
the
date
that
this
court
made
a
final
determination
such
a
construction
might
possibly
preclude
this
petitioner
down
below
if
called
before
the
grand
jury
again
to
attack
the
reasonableness
or
materiality
of
certain
questions
propounded
to
him.
in
other
words,
it
would
put
him
on
his
own
--
own
peril
that
if
he
would
challenge
the
materiality
that
he
would
not
purge
himself
and
that
he
would
remain
in
prison
and
if
any
members
of
the
court
raised
the
question
that
made
--
that
the
government
might
not
digress
from
the
purposes
of
the
investigation,
i
refer
the
court
to
page
six
of
the
record,
the
bottom
questions
propounded
to
reina
before
the
grand
jury.
i
haven't
raised
this
point
on
this
petition
but
at
the
bottom,
mr.
reina
was
asked
this
question.
mr.
reina,
was
your
father
thomas
a
member
of
an
organization
sometimes
known
as
the
mafia.
i
can
represent
to
this
court
from
my
own
personal
knowledge
that
mr.
reina's
father
died
30
years
ago.
reina
was
further
asked
that
his
father
had
a
title
don
in
that
organization,
then
he
was
asked
after
his
father's
death,
did
reina
take
the
place
and
title
of
don
in
the
organization
and
what
are
the
names
of
the
members
of
the
organization?
this
i
respectfully
submit
has
to
the
deal
with
matters
that
occurred
30
years
ago
and
could
have
no
possible
reference
to
any
narcotic
investigation
or
narcotic
matter
now
under
investigation.
i
would
like
to
refer
this
court
in
the
conclusion
of
my
argument
that
title
21
united
states
code
section
198,
which
does
not
appear
in
my
brief,
this
makes
it
a
duty
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
make
narcotic
information
available
to
the
state
governments
the
use
in
the
state
courts.
i
would
also
like
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
i
omitted
this
from
my
brief,
i
omitted
the
state
of
california.
the
california
penal
code
section
1324,
1958
supplement
by
statute,
and
by
statute
the
state
of
california
has
adopted
the
michigan
rule
which
disagrees
with
the
murdock
decision.
thank
you.
