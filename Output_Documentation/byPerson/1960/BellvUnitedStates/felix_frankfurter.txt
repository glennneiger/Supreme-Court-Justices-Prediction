what
does
that
mean,
the
essence
of
things?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
did
--
what
was
their
status?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
period
in
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
but
that
is
contradicted
in
the
contemplation
of
those
who
use
the
phrase
that
you
just
used.
in
the
essence
of
things,
they
were
not
in
the
service.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
-
how
is
it
terminated?
by
what's
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
on
the
basis
of
what
can
the
discharge
be
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
do
you
assume
that
a
man
--
the
status
maybe
terminated
by
the
administrative
discharge?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
the
basis
for
saying
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
dishonorable
discharge
is
something
else?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
agree,
you
admit
that
dishonorable
discharge
can
be
given
administratively?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
isn't
that
--
why
don't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
isn't
relevant
because
if
it
couldn't
be
administratively
--
if
he
couldn't
be
administratively
dishonorably
discharged
if
he
is
still
in
the
service,
and
then
your
case
is
clear.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
think
that's
not
a
relevant
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
--
but
when
you
say
united
states
wouldn't
go
behind
it,
that
doesn't
establish
that
he
--
that
he
is
--
that
he
has
equal
power
to
exercise
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
held
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
there
was
a
ruling
by
the
judge
advocate
general
to
the
contrary?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
is
that
a
matter
not
relevant
to
this
question?
if
they
were
--
if
they
were
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
interesting
that
it
is
subject
of
notion
that
although
they're
enlisted
men,
they're
not
in
service.
it
goes
in
that
further.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
think
whether
the
parties
himself
or
herself
can
determine
whether
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
telling
us
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
although
a
man
is
indisputably
an
enlisted
man
has
a
status
of
an
enlisted
man
indeed
(inaudible),
purportedly
and
dishonorably
discharged
--
dishonorably
discharged
beyond
the
power
of
discharging
officer.
are
you
telling
us
although
he's
still
has
a
status
of
an
enlisted
man,
you
can
administratively
determine
whether
he
ceased
to
give
service
from
the
value
received
and
therefore
doesn't
get
the
value
received
and
that's
the
finding
of
the
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
any
constitutional
difficulty
but
as
chief
justice's
question
suggests
it
implied
that
all
this
within
the
control
of
the
pentagon?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
whether
they
should
or
should
get
paid?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
starting
point
of
our
colloquy
is
that
he
--
he
retains
the
status,
we
assume
that
he
still
has
the
status.
what
i
want
to
know
whether
statute
or
inherent
power
of
the
military
enables
them
to
determine
administratively
what
the
pay
consequences
are?
justice
felix
frankfurter
unless
you
have
to
go
back
--
but
you
have
to
go
back
in
the
line
of
the
statute
which
allowed
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
department
to
do
it.
