mr.
george
s.
leonard
mr.
chief
justice,
it
maybe
of
some
assistance
if
i
refer
somewhat
more
definitely
to
the
statutes
which
were
involved
here.
this
is
basically
a
military
pay
case.
it
could
occur
under
virtually
any
circumstances,
but
it
did
in
korea
is
not
particularly
changing
of
the
law
in
that,
the
problem
first
that
the
government
has
before
it
or
rather
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
before
him
is
to
prove
his
right
to
basic
pay.
now,
it
will
have
occurred
to
the
court
that
there
have
been
a
great
many
statements
here
made
that
this
pay
continues
to
be
accrue
to
an
enlisted
man,
regardless
of
any
condition.
now,
of
course
there
has
been
no
citation
on
this
argument
or
in
the
briefs
to
the
pay
statutes,
only
to
the
prisoner
of
war
statute
which
continue
such
pay
as
will
otherwise
be
owing.
there
is
a
basic
pay
statute.
it
is
not
based
upon
the
status
of
being
an
enlisted
man
at
all.
it
is
effective
to
every
person
in
the
uniformed
services
of
which
must
had
it
in
myself
as
it
so
happens
they're
also
members
and
if
maybe
that
neither
representative
are
going
to
pay
at
the
present
time.
the
basic
pay
statute
is
found
in
37
u.s.c.
232.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
37
the
united
states
code
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
is
not
in
our
brief
mr.
george
s.
leonard
this
is
basically
--
we
have
argued
in
the
brief
merely
that
there
is
no
basic
pay
right
shown
by
the
petitioner.
i
thought
i
would
bring
to
the
court's
attention
this
specific
statute
in
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
quote
from
232
which
is
now
subsection
d
and
was
at
the
time
subsection
a,
"all
members
of
the
uniformed
services,
when
on
the
active
list,
when
on
active
duty
or
when
participating
in
full
time
training,
training
duty
with
pay
or
other
full
time
duty,"
and
i
skip,
"are
entitled
by
law
to
receive
from
the
federal
government,"
now
where
am
i,
i'm
sorry,
get
down
to,
"shall
be
entitled
to
receive
the
basic
pay
of
the
pay
grade
to
which
assigned."
now,
these
are
the
conditions.
first,
the
active
list,
second,
active
duty,
third,
full
time
training,
fourth,
training
duty
with
pay,
fifth,
other
full
time
duty.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
is
not
applicable.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
particular
case,
the
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below,
come
under
no
one
of
those
categories.
they
were
not
on
the
active
list.
they
were
not
on
active
duty.
they
were
not
participating
in
training
and
they
were
not
other
full
time
duty.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
he
is
arguing
that
they
have
a
basic
right
to
pay
and
allowances
which
is
continued
as
a
prisoner
of
war.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
in
the
actual
service
in
the
united
states.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
precisely.
in
other
words,
i
may
go
ahead
on
that
statute
your
honor.
there
were
two
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
in
other
words,
he
gets
the
same
pay
and
allowances
as
if
excluding
the
prisoner
of
war
status,
he
has
to
do
these
things
whatever
conduct
was
taken
care
of
in
his
normal
status
of
an
enlisted
soldier.
is
he
entitled
to
pay?
now,
it
is
the
government's
position
in
this,
the
pay
in
the
military
services
is
given
only
and
the
decisions
to
this
court
will
support
me,
only
when
there
has
not
been
a
voluntary
abandonment
of
a
military
obligation.
and
to
illustrate
that,
i
will
first
take
up
the
fundamental
case
in
this
court
which
is
the
kelly
case,
that
shortly
after
the
civil
war.
kelly
was
a
soldier
in
the
union
army
who
deserted
for
two
months
as
a
result
of
a
family
situation,
came
back
voluntarily,
turned
himself
in,
was
never
tried
for
desertion
and
agreed
as
the
condition
not
to
be
tried,
that
he
would
serve
an
additional
two
months
and
make
up
the
time
that
was
involved.
he
was
given
an
honorable
discharge
at
the
end
of
his
service.
he
sued
for
bounty
pay
which
was
denied
and
then
this
court
gave
him
the
bounty
pay
and
this
court
tells
that
he
had
come
back
and
he
had
made
up
his
time.
however,
this
court,
speaking
three
years
later
and
referring
to
the
kelly
case
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
in
the
earlier
kelly
case,
and
i
will
read
this
court's
language,
"it
was
not
pretended
that
his
honorable
discharge
subsequently
granted,
gave
him
a
right
to
pay
during
the
period
of
his
absence
from
service."
now
in
landers
itself,
the
man
came
in
who
had
deserted
for
a
period
of
almost
a
year
and
was
brought
back
by
the
military
instead
of
coming
back
otherwise,
but
sued
for
his
pay
during
the
period
of
desertion
i.e
the
period
when
he
was
not
serving
the
united
states.
this
court
carefully
pointed
out
that
as
to
back
pay
as
opposed
to
future
pay,
the
question
of
whether
service
had
been
granted
to
the
united
states
under
the
military
obligation
was
one
for
the
court
to
determine.
this
was
a
question
of
fact
whether
in
fact,
the
service
for
which
he
was
being
pay
--
paid
was
being
rendered.
now,
this
has
also
been
the
rule
in
the
court
of
claims
and
i
will
refer
first
to
the
two
cases
which
involve
a
somewhat
similar
situation.
when
a
soldier
is
arrested
civilly
and
in
essence
he
is
a
prisoner
in
a
jurisdiction
which
the
military
cannot
reach.
and
the
cases
in
the
court
of
claims,
there
have
been
pay
cases
which
have
considered
whether
or
not
he
gets
pay
during
the
time
he
is
absent
without
leave
and
those
cases
fall
into
two
categories.
first,
if
he
was
absent
without
leave
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
even
though
he
is
cleared
of
any
charge
thereafter,
he
is
not
paid
to
the
time
of
his
absence.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
was
on
proper
leave
or
in
the
course
of
military
duty,
so
that
his
absence
from
--
by
civil
arrest
is
involuntary
in
his
case,
he
is
entitled
to
his
pay
even
though
he
had
no
military
authority
to
be
away
during
that
period
of
time.
so,
again,
we
reach
this
voluntary
concept,
namely,
that
there
is
a
service
obligation
to
be
performed.
two
other
cases,
which
illustrate
this
almost
directly,
are
walsh
and
carrington
in
the
court
of
claims.
here,
officers
were
ordered
to
await
a
trial
by
court-martial
after
misconduct
and
they
spent
some
period
of
time
awaiting
it.
they
sued
for
pay
and
they
were
rewarded
pay
upon
the
grounds
that
while
they
did
nothing,
their
status
was
subject
to
orders.
in
this
connection,
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
prison
in
a
--
an
enlisted
man
in
a
hospital,
on
leave
or
otherwise
is
always
acting
according
to
orders.
whatever
his
status
may
be,
he
is
in
an
order
or
duty
position
and
the
active
list
self
in
terms
of
pay
is
availability
for
duty.
it
is
defined
militarily
in
terms
of
either
being
on
duty
or
available
to
duty.
now,
that
is
the
point
at
which
this
case
departs
on
the
facts
and
that
is
also
the
point
on
which
these
statutes,
very
clearly
make
a
distinction.
i
would
like
to
take
those
statutes.
in
the
first
place,
the
basic
pay
statute
as
i
have
read
it
indicates
an
obligation
of
service,
of
duty
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
--
as
a
condition
for
pay.
that
is
232,
which
i
was
reading.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
it
is
not
in
the
brief.
we
--
we
contend
that
they
have
not
proven
the
basic
right
to
pay
at
all.
they
do
not
refer
to
the
basic
pay
statute.
they
make
the
statement
only
that
they're
entitled
to
it.
it's
our
argument
that
they
haven't
proven
that.
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
and
they
have
contested
it
that
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
in
their
reply
brief
on
page
17,
they
complain
of
our
assertion,
our
argument
that
they
never
became
entitled
to
pay
and
their
argument
--
i
read
now
from
page
17,
“military
pay
is
accrued
daily
and
paid
by
monthly
unless
there
is
some
condition
in
addition
to
putting
in
time.”
and
what
i
am
now
arguing
for
the
government
as
is
my
fundamental
proposition
is
that
there
is
a
condition
in
addition
to
putting
in
time,
and
that
is
faithful
service.
it
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
work.
you
maybe
on
leave,
you
maybe
in
the
country,
you
maybe
at
home,
but
whatever
condition
you
are,
you
are
in
a
military
status
of
obedience
to
orders.
you've
been
given
leave,
you've
been
allowed
to
go
to
the
hospital,
you've
been
sent
somewhere,
you're
in
a
travel
status,
you've
been
given
a
year
off
to
study,
but
whatever
it
maybe,
you
are
as
these
men
who
were
awaiting
court-martial
were
in
obedience
to
a
given
organizational
order.
in
other
words,
they
are
subject
to
their
military
obligation
and
performing
it.
actual
work
of
course
is
not
necessary.
now,
in
this
sense,
a
prisoner
of
war
performs
service
also.
a
prisoner
of
war
is
obligated
under
the
various
parts
of
the
--
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and
the
regulations
of
the
army
to
be
responsive
to
senior
officer
present
in
the
military
camp.
he
is
obligated
to
assist
his
comrades
wherever
he
can.
there
are
various
obligations
and
military
law
has
always
continued
through
a
period
of
imprisonment.
now,
i
can
show
that.
we
have
been
talking
here
about
242
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
243
and
244,
which
came
a
few
years
later
than
242,
in
order
to
cover
the
navy
in
the
same
way
that
242
referred
to
the
army
and
i
think
the
navy
here
has
somewhat
of
a
more
expressive
statute.
first,
we
have
the
condition
where
a
navy
ship
is
lost
or
shipwrecked
and
the
statement
is
as
follows,
“when
the
crew
of
any
vessel
of
the
united
states
are
separated
from
such
vessel
by
means
of
a
wreck,
loss,
or
destruction,
the
pay
and
the
emoluments
of
such
of
the
officers
and
men,
they
shall
appear
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy
by
the
sentence
of
a
court-martial
or
by
a
court
of
inquiry,
or
by
other
status
factory
evidence
to
have
done
their
utmost
to
preserver
and
after
said
wreck,
loss
or
destruction
to
have
behaved
themselves
agreeably
to
the
discipline
of
the
navy,
shall
go
on
and
be
paid
until
their
discharge
or
death.”
in
244,
they
considered
the
fact
that
the
navy
became
prisoners
of
war
as
well
and
their
ships
were
captured
and
the
language
is
roughly
similar
and
it
comes
down
to
this,
“that
if
it'd
be
shown
that
they
have
done
their
utmost
to
preserve
and
defend
their
vessel,
and
after
the
taking
thereof
to
have
behaved
themselves
agreeably
to
the
discipline
of
the
navy
shall
go
on
and
be
paid.”
now,
here
you
have
in
carrying
material,
statutes
which
show
in
essence
what
is
meant
by
the
word
captivity
in
242.
it
is
this
condition
of
being
agreeable
to
the
discipline
of
the
navy,
agreeable
to
the
discipline
of
the
army,
subjection
to
the
senior
officer
present,
carrying
out
of
his
orders,
none
aid
to
the
enemy,
non-communication
with
the
enemy,
in
other
words,
no
breach
of
the
fundamental
military
obligation.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
has
--
it
has
in
effect.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
your
honor,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
in
the
statutory
history
how
these
three
particular
parts
which
were
not
passed
as
part
of
the
general
chapter
here
came
to
be
repeated
after
the
missing
persons
act
had
been
passed
which
takes
in
all
uniformed
services
and
all
prisoners
of
war
and
specifically
as
to
prisoners
of
war
since
they
was
a
question
about
that
before.
in
other
words,
50
--
in
50
appendix
1002
which
is
part
of
the
missing
persons
act,
it
specifically
has
captured
by
a
hostile
force
and
continues
in
that
status.
so
the
missing
persons
act
covers
for
all
uniformed
services
in
a
uniform
manner
exactly
this
problem
of
capture
by
a
hostile
force
and
retention
in
captivity
and
the
pay
that
will
be
owing.
i
may
say
that
the
missing
persons
act
is
interesting
in
that
it
goes
beyond
the
military
itself
and
applies
equally
to
“active
federal
service
performed
by
civilian
officers”.
in
other
words,
this
active
service
concept
which
i
am
now
presenting
as
a
basis
for
pay
under
these
statutes
goes
entirely
through
the
cases
first
the
legislation
as
well.
so
that
under
1002,
which
is
the
missing
persons
act,
it
is
our
feeling
that
the
two
statutes
can
be
construed
together,
1288
and
the
missing
persons
act
simply
because
1288
speaks
in
terms
of
service
and
it
speaks
in
terms
of
captivity.
now,
it
has
been
stated
here
that
it
has
been
admitted
that
these
people
were
confined
as
prisoners
of
war.
it
has
been
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
by
the
court
below,
by
the
commissioner
below,
unobjected
to
and
in
fact,
stipulated
that
these
men
came
and
went
in
the
prison
camp
at
their
own
will,
that
they
wore
uniforms
of
the
opposing
army
that
they
used
the
px
which
was
not
available
to
any
of
the
other
men
and
that
they
communicated
within
and
without
the
camp.
and
it
is
purely
on
the
basis
of
this
stipulation
of
fact
that
this
question
of
captivity,
if
it's
physical
in
its
nature
has
been
found
against
the
claimants
first
by
the
army
and
then
secondly
by
the
court
of
claims
acting
de
novo.
so
that
they
were
not
confined
in
the
same
sense
as
any
of
the
others,
they
were
not
prisoners
in
that
sense.
now
this
goes
back
to
the
earlier
question
of
mr.
justice
whittaker,
namely,
what
happened
after
their
renunciation
of
repatriation.
well,
the
claim
that
is
now
before
this
court
is
for
combat
pay
following
they're
going
to
china
and
working
for
the
chinese
and
live
in
korea
whenever
that
may
have
been
as
well
as
basic
pay
and
allowances
while
they
were
in
fact
working
in
china
and
not
in
any
camp
or
otherwise
from
which
they
were
repatriated
later
and
it
includes
this
entire
period
as
being
a
single
thing.
now,
had
it
been
broken
up
into
the
period
when
they
were
prisoners
of
war
before
these
particular
acts
started,
the
precapture
pay
which
i
may
say
purely
technically
is
not
in
this
case
because
it's
denied
in
the
petition
and
the
court
itself
note
no
amendment
has
ever
been
put
in.
pre-capture
pay
is
not
in
the
case.
actually,
it's
de
minimus,
it's
really
of
no
concern
whether
it's
to
be
paid
or
not.
the
army
has
never
denied
pre-capture
pay.
it
has
denied
post
capture
pay.
if
we
take
the
post
capture
period
and
assume
that
up
until
some
date,
they
acted
as
prisoners
of
war
under
the
discipline
of
the
united
states
army,
then
we
have
a
very
interesting
question,
the
one
that
was
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
landers
whether
you
should
go
beyond
the
period
of
faithful
service
and
forfeit
as
well
by
judicial,
not
court-martial,
not
military
or
administrative,
but
by
judicial
finding
of
desertion
early
amounts
which
had
in
fact
accrued.
now,
my
entire
argument
has
been
made
on
the
basis
that
nothing
accrued
under
any
of
the
statutes.
however,
the
second
point
here
for
the
government
is
clearly
that
under
the
missing
persons
act,
it
is
provided
that
no
person
maybe
paid
who
is
“officially
determined
absent
from
his
post
of
duty
without
authority.”
well,
now,
a
prisoner
has
a
post
of
duty
in
spite
of
the
general
remark
which
was
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
--
counsel
for
the
petitioners
because
this
statute
only
deals
with
persons
who
are
missing
or
captured,
or
are
otherwise
in
a
status
which
can
be
continued.
every
person
under
orders
has
a
post
of
duty.
it
may
have
been
in
the
prison
camp,
it
may
have
been
where
the
senior
officer
present
wanted
them
to
be,
but
whatever
it
was,
there
is
a
post
of
duty
and
that
duty
continued
whether
on
a
prisoner
status
or
not.
therefore
there
could
and
was
in
fact
found
by
the
court
below
a
total
absence
from
the
post
of
duty
of
these
particular
petitioners.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
had
they
accepted,
repatriation
pay
would
have
picked
out
immediately
at
that
point,
they
would
have
become
subject
to
orders
again
immediately
you
see.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
the
period
before,
that
could
be
divided
into
two
parts
-
one,
when
they
were
not
working
for
the
chinese,
and
two,
when
they
were.
now,
our
argument
is
that
no
pay
could
accrue
during
the
second
of
those
periods.
as
to
the
first
to
those
periods,
whether
or
not
you
can
reach
back
to
them
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
but
there
were
several
others.
this
was
a
rather
spectacular
instance
as
i
think
it's
--
i
think
it
bears
directly
on
your
point
of
that
this
dishonorable
discharge
being
given
administratively
that
probably
nothing
in
the
army
would
like
better
at
the
moment
to
find
out
that
those
were
improper
discharges
and
these
three
gentlemen
are
still
enlisted
men
subjected
to
military
law.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
was
brought
up
in
connection
with
the
effort
of
the
military.
as
i
understand
that
there
was
some
argument
made
at
the
time
it
was
finally
decided
that
you
couldn't
--
the
united
states
would
not
go
behind
the
secretary
it
was
the
administrative
action
and
of
course
it's
quite
clear
that
the
plaintiffs
were
not
going
to
go
behind
it.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i'm
--
i'm
not
clear
on
what
the
record
was
made
in
that
particular
case.
it
was
decided
that
they
could
not
be
court-martialed
based
upon
those
particular.
so
that
has
been
held
and
that
is
now
behind
us.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that
was
held
by
the
district
court
in
los
angeles
i
believe
or
on
the
west
coast
somewhere.
and
that
was
made
and
there
was
--
there
was
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
issued
on
the
basis
of
that
these
--
these
discharges
were
held
valid
and
the
men
were
held
not
subject
to
military
law.
that
is
quite
important.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
the
government
did
not
seek
review.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
i
do
not
recall
it
sir.
it
could
have
been
--
it
could
have
been.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
let
me
put
it
this
way,
your
honor.
if
they
are
still
unlisted
men,
they
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
any
pay
or
allowances
for
the
period
when
they
were
not
serving
as
enlisted
men,
in
other
words,
when
they
were
not
rendering
service.
that
would
be
true
whether
they
are
still
enlisted
man
or
not.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
ordinarily
this
problem
does
not
come
up
your
honor
for
this
reason.
if
an
enlisted
man
ceases
his
military
obligation
in
any
way,
let's
say
commits
a
fault
of
some
kind,
that
cannot
last
over
sufficient
period
of
time
before
he's
picked
up
militarily
you
see
unless
it's
an
absence
or
desertion
type
where
you
have
to
go
find
him.
that
is
why
this
loss
of
pay
by
absence
or
desertion
is
essentially
the
only
one
you
keep
running
into,
but
you
can
desert
theoretically
your
duty
in
your
mind
not
within
the
military
term
of
desertion
but
within
the
contract
theory
of
desertion.
and
this
--
this
court
very
carefully
put
in
the
landers
case
the
contract
interpretation
upon
the
pay
obligation.
i'm
not
talking
now
about
the
military
obligation
but
the
pay
obligation.
they
are
two
different
things.
the
status
as
an
enlisted
man
continues
and
i
can
take
as
an
analogy
of
there
a
marriage
which
creates
both
the
status
and
a
contract.
there
is
an
obligation
contractual
or
otherwise
in
marriage,
the
support,
but
if
you
have
an
abandonment
of
the
marriage
relationship,
you
cannot
have
a
unilateral
breaking
of
the
status
but
you
can
have
by
that
act
a
loss
of
the
support
right,
am
i
correct?
in
the
contract
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
on
the
contract
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
can't
change
the
relationship
but
they
can
lose
the
right
to
support.
now
that
is
true
here.
they
could
never
cease
to
be
enlisted
men
by
anything
they
did
under
any
circumstances,
but
they
could
lose
their
right
to
collect
pay
by
what
they
do.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no.
first,
if
the
statute
gives
it
to
them
which
is
our
first
point.
secondly,
is
there
not
in
the
status
determined
under
the
missing
persons
act.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
many
people
still
in
the
military
service
today,
who
are
prisoners
of
war
in
korea
and
whose
status
was
determined
administratively
with
regard
to
their
pay
and
--
pay
and
allowances,
that
--
that
i
see
no
reason
why
during
the
course
of
a
military
relationship,
there
can't
be
various
administrative
determinations
from
time
to
time
as
to
the
status
of
the
individual
concern
does
on
duty
or
not.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
not
at
all
your
honor,
only
these
particular
status
elements
which
are
found
in
the
missing
persons
act.
that's
what
this
court
--
this
court
has
held
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
kingsley
case
that
had
a
determination
administrative
of
status
of
character,
a
character
of
the
soldier
is
--
is
(inaudible)
mr.
george
s.
leonard
only
by
special
statutory
authority.
in
other
words
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
precisely.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
allows
the
department
to
do
it
and
that
is
in
the
missing
persons
act.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
it
says
there
shall
be
no
entitlement
to
pay
allowances
for
any
period
during
which
sets
first,
maybe
officially
determined,
absent
from
his
post
of
duty
without
authority,
and
it
is
provided
that
the
head
of
the
department
concerned
or
such
subordinate
he
may
designate
shall
have
authority
to
make
all
the
determinations
necessary
of
the
administration
of
this
act
--
i'm
reading
from
section
1009
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
act,
determination
so
made
shall
be
conclusive
as
to
death
or
finding
of
death
and
as
to
any
other
status
dealt
with
by
this
act.
now,
in
the
marino
case
in
the
court
of
claims,
the
question
of
a
status
directly
under
this
military
persons
act
and
the
--
its
administrative
determination
was
held
to
be
properly
conclusive
and
less
completely
arbitrary.
the
court
below
feeling
that
there
might
be
a
question
that
this
had
been
an
arbitrary
determination
did
in
fact
reviewed
de
novo
although
upholding
the
administrative
right
to
make
a
conclusive
determination
that
the
status
of
captivity
and
subjection
to
military
obligation
had
not
continued
in
the
case
of
these
claimants.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
my
understanding
is
that
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
limits
itself
to
a
forfeiture
of
future
pay.
in
other
words
--
and
any
(inaudible)
future
is
punishable.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
back
pay
has
all
–
back
pay
if
any
has
been
forfeited
regularly
as
the
administrative
matter
and
by
the
courts.
and
i
can
--
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
well,
he
used
the
general
statement
that
pay
should
not
be
forfeited
without
a
court-martial
which
of
course
failed
to
distinguish
between
the
punishment
aspect
of
the
forfeiture
of
future
pay
and
the
administrative
forfeiture
or
judicial
forfeiture
of
what
amounts
to
an
amount
owing
upon
the
ground
that
the
service
for
which
it
was
paid
has
not
in
fact
then
performed
as
(inaudible)
the
court
and
this
court
in
the
landers
case
specifically
considered
the
difference
between
these
two
--
two
matters.
if
i
may
read
for
one
moment,
it
does
not
appear
from
the
record
before
us
whether
this
forfeiture
was
imposed
by
order
of
the
commander
of
the
forces
from
which
he
deserted
or
by
the
judgment
of
the
court-martial.
forfeiture
of
pay
and
loans
is
up
to
the
time
of
desertion
follows
from
conditions
of
the
contract
of
enlistment
which
is
for
faithful
service.
mr.
george
s.
leonard
that's
judge
field's
opinion.
