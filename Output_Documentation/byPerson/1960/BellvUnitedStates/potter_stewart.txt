how
did

well,
let's
assume
that
facts
are
not
too
dissimilar
perhaps
for
the
facts
that
are
actually
here,
that
these
men
were
missing
and
that
they
disappeared
and
presumed
they
were
captured
and
were
presumably,
so
far
as
our
army
knew,
were
being
held
as
prisoners
of
war.
then
two
years
later,
it
turned
out
that
the
--
instead
of
that,
they
have
the
--
they
had
deserted
and
had
joined
a
foreign
army.
and
they
then,
they're
brought
back
and
not
until
then
--
not
until
that
is
ascertained
are
they
--
do
they
receive
technically
a
piece
of
paper
giving
them
a
dishonorable
discharge
from
our
army.
isn't
what
your
position
be
that
until
that
discharge
came
they
were
entitled
pay
from
our
army,
although
they've
been
fighting
in
another
army?
