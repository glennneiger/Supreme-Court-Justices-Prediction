oh
where
is
he,
is
there
no
one
on
the
other
side?

justice
earl

mr.
hannon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
talking
about
it.
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
--
pardon
--
is
that
fairly
before
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
do
you
concede
that
this
comes
under
the
missing
persons
statute?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
wouldn't
be
joining
an
enemy
army
be
a
desertion?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
was
--
if
it
was
desertion,
it
wouldn't
be
--
it
wouldn't
be
under
the
--
they
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
anything
under
the
missing
persons
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
mean
to
apply
it
to
your
people.
i
was
just
asking
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i'm
not
trying
to
apply
it
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
a
stipulation,
is
there
not,
as
to
the
amount
of
money
that's
involved?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
that
is
in
this
transcript,
is
that
transcript
attached
to
that
finding?
is
that
finding
in
the
transcript
of
records?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
leonard.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
does
it
say?
what
does
that
statute
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
say
that
is
or
is
not
applicable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
counsel
argued
here
that
they
did
come
under
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
did
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
he
was
relying
on
37
u.s.c.
242
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
says,
"every
noncommissioned
officer
and
private
of
the
regular
army
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
who
was
captured
by
the
enemy
shall
be
entitled
to
receive
during
his
captivity,
notwithstanding
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
service
the
same
pay,
subsistence,
and
allowance
to
which
he
may
be
entitled
while
in
the
actual
service
of
the
united
states."
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
same
as
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
--
what
i
want
to
know,
does
this
apply
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
one
does,
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
--
is
it
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
a
two-edged
argument
if
congress
had
intended
it
under
these
other
statutes
wouldn't
it
had
said
so
or
couldn't
it
have
said
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
it
did
say
so
in
those
two
statutes,
but
did
it
say
so
in
the
one
that
governs
these
people.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
the
statute
says
so
perhaps.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
it?
just
what
does
it
say
in
that
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
hannon.
