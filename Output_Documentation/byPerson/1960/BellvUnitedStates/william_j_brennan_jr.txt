justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
leonard,
on
that
approach,
i
gather
that
acceptance
or
refusal
of
repatriation
is
not
really
significant,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
had
accepted
repatriation,
i
gather
your
argument
would
mean
they
still
would
not
have
been
compensable
for
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
for
the
period
before
that,
when
did
you
say
they
were
in
fact
workers
for
chinese?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
is
this
kind
of
inquiry
made
on
repatriation
(inaudible)?
i
take
it
this
was
a
--
rather
spectacular
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
government
didn't
seek
to
review
that
i
gather.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hannon
do
i
understand
that
your
permission
basically
is
this
that
these
men
may
not
be
deprive
of
this
pay
without
a
court-martial
determination
in
connection
with
which
there's
an
order
of
forfeiture
of
the
pay
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
--
what
some
other
type?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
(inaudible)
what
is
your
position
in
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
be
in
connection
with
--
well
that
would
just
be
a
fine,
would
it
not?
