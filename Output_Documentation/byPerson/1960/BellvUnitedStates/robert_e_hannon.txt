i

your
honors.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
thank
you
your
honor.
if
the
court
please.
this
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
this
involves
the
claim
by
three
former
korean
prisoners
of
war
for
pay
which
they
claim
as
owed
to
them
under
two
express
federal
statutes.
the
first
to
these
statutes
is,
the
so-called
prisoner
of
war
pay
statute,
the
other
is
the
missing
persons
act.
i'd
like,
in
commencing
my
argument,
to
read
the
prisoner
of
war
act
or
prisoner
of
war
pay
statute.
this
statute
is
presently
found
in
37
u.s.c.
242.
however,
at
the
time
of
filing
the
petition,
it
was
in
10
u.s.c.
846.
this
particular
statute
provides
that,
"every
noncommissioned
officer
and
private
of
the
regular
army
and
every
officer,
noncommissioned
officer
and
private
of
the
militia
or
volunteer
corps
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
who
was
captured
by
the
enemy,
shall
be
entitled
to
receive
during
his
captivity,
notwithstanding
the
expiration
of
his
term
of
enlistment
the
same
pay,
subsistence,
and
allowance
to
which
he
may
be
entitled
while
in
the
actual
service
of
the
united
states.
this
provision
shall
not
be
construed
to
entitle
any
prisoner
of
war
of
such
militia
corps
to
any
pay
or
compensation
after
the
date
of
his
parole,
except
the
traveling
expenses
allowed
by
law."
that
is
the
statute
in
its
entirety.
that
statute,
as
i
mentioned
is
currently
subsisting
legislation.
in
the
incident
case
we're
speaking
of
three
former
prisoners
of
war
by
the
facts
admitted
in
the
pleadings
by
the
stipulation
of
facts
submitted
to
the
court
of
claims
and
by
the
findings
of
the
lower
court,
the
following
have
been
conclusively
established.
first
of
all,
that
each
of
the
petitioners
enlisted
in
the
army;
that
is
the
regular
army
in
1949.
each
of
the
prisoners
was
captured
by
enemy
forces
in
korea
in
1950
and
1951.
subsequent
to
their
capture
while
they
were
still
prisoners
of
war,
they
were,
by
the
army,
promoted
to
corporal.
they
were
confined
as
prisoners
of
war
from
the
date
of
their
capture
until
august
23rd
of
1953.
this
is
the
admission
from
the
defendant's
answer.
it
is
our
contention
that
they
were
confined
as
prisoners
of
war
until
their
dishonorable
discharges
in
january
of
1954.
during
this
period
of
confinement,
the
plaintiffs
misconducted
themselves.
they
were
ultimately
dishonorably
discharged
january
of
1954.
in
1955,
they
returned
to
the
united
states.
they
were
arrested
by
the
army
and
held
pending
trials
by
general
court-martial
for
violation
of
article
104
which
is
misconduct
by
a
prisoner
of
war,
and
article
105
which
is
aiding
the
enemy.
the
district
court
in
california
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
ruling
that
they
could
not
be
tried
by
the
army
as
the
army
had
lost
jurisdiction
because
of
the
dishonorable
discharge
in
line
with
the
toth
case.
however,
the
district
court
did
not
rule
that
they
could
not
be
tried.
they
had
only
ruled
that
they
could
not
be
tried
by
court-martial.
the
petitioners
then
and
now
could
still
be
tried
in
the
federal
district
court
in
san
francisco
or
any
other
federal
district
court
where
they're
located
on
the
charge
of
treason.
the
army
or
the
government
to
date
has
not
seen
fit
to
bring
these
persons
to
trial
in
a
civilian
court
with
a
civilian
jury.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
my
understanding
of
the
law,
justice
stewart,
is
that
a
person
guilty
of
treason
or
suspected
of
treason
can
be
tried
in
any
court
wherever
he's
located,
regardless
of
where
the
act
was
committed.
we
--
in
our
brief
at
page
--
from
pages
10
to
16
in
our
opening
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
line
by
line
how
these
--
the
facts
of
this
case
fully
comply
with
all
of
the
conditions
of
10
u.s.c.
846.
the
petitioners
have
full
complied
with
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
however,
when
they
made
their
demand
to
their
back
pay,
the
army
refused
to
pay
them.
i
should
now
like
to
point
out
that
we
are
asking
not
only
for
the
pay
from
the
date
of
their
capture
to
the
date
of
their
discharge,
but
we
are
also
asking
for
accrued
regular
pay
and
accrued
combat
pay
which
they
earned
prior
to
the
date
of
their
capture.
the
army
has
refused
to
pay
any
of
this
pay
and
i
feel
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
i
believe
it
is
your
honor
in
the
initial
letter
from
co-counsel
harold
brown
in
this
case,
he
demanded
all
of
the
back
pay.
and
those
are
the
words
that
he
used.
second,
the
statute
that
is
the
missing
persons
act,
50
u.s.c.
1002
provides
all
pay
due
at
the
time
of
capture.
i
raised
it
in
my
opening
brief
on
pages
8
to
15.
that
was
the
opening
brief
to
the
court
of
claims.
the
court
of
claims
had
before
it
the
findings
of
the
commissioner.
it
had
before
the
stipulation
of
facts
attached
as
an
exhibit
to
the
commissioner's
report
where
the
pay
records
or
the
accounting
of
the
general
accounting
office
and
it's
clearly
spelled
out
there
that
we
were
asking
for
pay.
i
argued
to
the
court
of
claims
that
we
were
asking
for
combat
and
regular
pay
accrued
prior
to
capture.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
yes,
your
honor.
i
feel
the
--
they're
equally
entitled
under
both
statutes.
i
feel
both
statutes
are
in
full
force
and
effect
and
under
both
statutes,
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
their
prayer.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
that's
the
debate
--
the
--
there
is
no
specified
date
as
to
when
repatriation
was
refused
other
than
that
it
was
after
the
august
8th
in
1953.
however,
it
is
our
contention
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
these
men
were
members
of
the
army
from
the
day
of
their
mustering
into
the
army
until
their
date
of
discharge
from
the
army.
and
there's
a
long
line
of
presidents
cited
in
the
briefs
to
the
effect
that
military
--
that
as
long
as
a
person
is
mustered
into
the
army
and
not
mustered
out
of
the
army,
he
is
entitled
of
the
pay
of
the
office
unless
forfeited
by
some
means
known
to
law
which
is
by
the
sentence
of
a
court-martial.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
i
believe
the
defendants
had
admitted
elsewhere
in
their
answers
that
they
where
prisoners
of
war
until
they
were
remit
--
until
they
were
dishonorably
discharged.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
had
they
joined
a
foreign
army,
i
don't
feel
that
under
this
particular
or
either
of
these
particular
statutes,
they
would
be
excluded
for
this
reason,
if
i
might
continue?
they
are
entitled
to
the
pay
so
long
as
they
are
in
the
office.
as
soon
as
they're
discharged,
they're
out
of
the
office
or
out
of
the
status.
now,
if
they
were
tried
for
example
for
treason,
the
district
court
trying
them
for
treason
could
forfeit
all
that
pay,
but
they
have
not
been
tried
for
treason
and
therefore
they're
presumed
not
to
be
guilty
of
treason
which
is
the
same
as
joining
a
foreign
army,
they're
presumed
not
to
--
they're
presumed
to
be
innocent
therefore
presumed
not
to
be
guilty
of
treason.
therefore,
i
feel
that
we
have
a
meaningless
situation
until
such
time
as
it
is
established
conclusively
that
they
did
join
the
foreign
army,
it
must
be
presumed
that
they
did
not.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
unless
forfeited
by
some
means
known
to
law
which
would
be
either
by
court-martial
or
trial
in
the
federal
district
court.
the
alternative
to
this
is,
would
be
the
other
equal.
suppose
the
army
suspected
them
of
joining
a
foreign
army
in
a
unilaterally,
administratively,
without
a
hearing,
without
any
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
based
on
the
supposition
that
they
had
forfeited
pay.
it
supposed
to
turn
out
but
they
didn't,
but
--
while
we're
saying
is
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
on
this.
some
type
of
hearing
before
they
forfeit
pay.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
it
could
be
if
it
was
so
charged.
however
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
there's
an
exception
in
the
missing
persons
act
providing
that
person
is
absent
from
post,
which
is
one
of
the
four
types
of
unauthorized
absence
is
not
entitled
under
the
act.
however,
the
accused
in
this
case
or
the
accused,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
not
and
could
not
be
guilty
of
unauthorized
absence
because
they
were
prisoners
of
war.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
well,
throughout
its
brief,
the
counsel
for
the
government
raises
this
question
of
desertion
and
unauthorized
absence.
they
are
totally
irrelevant
to
the
facts
of
this
case
because
these
men
were
not
and
could
not,
legally
could
not
be
guilty
of
absence.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
but
in
--
in
that
situation,
if
a
person
were
guilty
of
absence,
the
prisoner
of
war
were
guilty
of
absence,
then
there's
an
express
exclusion
under
the
act,
under
the
missing
persons
act,
excluding
them
from
entitlement.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
i
believe
that
statute
is
precisely
and
directly
in
point
with
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
and
if
in
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
we
defend
them
so
that
we
admitted
this
fact
by
their
pleadings
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
defendants
have
admitted
this
fact
by
their
pleadings.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
i
believe
the
august,
if
my
recollection
serves
me
correct
your
honor,
the
august
repatriation
dealt
with
sick
and
wounded.
the
other
non-sick
and
wounded
repatriates
were
repatriated
at
some
time
between
august,
the
last
one
is
coming
through
in
january
of
1954.
all
we
know
is
that
during
some
period
there,
but
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
first
affirmative
defense
in
the
defendant's
answer.
they
--
and
that
saved
a
position
--
and
that
affirmative
defense
admits
that
the
plaintiffs
were
prisoners
of
war
at
the
time
of
their
discharge,
in
captivity,
as
they
use
the
term
release
from
prison
as
prisoners
of
war.
i
believe
it's
the
direct
terminology
that
they
use.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
yes,
your
honor.
there's
a
stipulation
provided
--
it
was
made
from
accounting
--
from
the
general
accounting
office.
this
accounting
is
attached
and
as
an
exhibit
to
the
commissioner's
report.
this
accounting
provides
specifically
for
combat
or
regular
pay
amongst
other
things
earned
prior
to
date
of
capture.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
no,
your
honor.
it's
computed
entirely
on
a
one
page
accounting
which
shows
credits
and
debits
from
the
general
accounting
office.
there's
one
page
of
accounting
applicable
to
each
of
the
petitioners.
if
the
court
please,
if
i
may
proceed
very
briefly
here,
i
feel
that
the
true
significance
of
this
case
is
not
whether
or
not
these
particular
plaintiffs
are
paid.
i
feel
that
in
the
circumstances
and
in
relative
sense
that
is
relatively
unimportant.
i
feel
that
the
true
significance,
the
true
importance
of
this
case
is
the
effect
that
the
unilateral
administrative
retroactive
forfeiture
of
military
pay
will
have
on
the
future
servicemen.
i
feel
that
any
servicemen
before
his
pay
is
forfeited
should
at
least,
be
entitled
to
argue
to
court,
should
be
entitled
to
a
hearing,
should
be
entitled
confrontation,
should
be
entitled
a
notice.
i
feel
he
should
be
entitled
across
examine
his
accusers.
the
pay
of
a
military
man
is
extremely
important.
it's
one
of
the
most
important
rights
of
the
servicemen.
it's
one
of
the
major
morale
factors
of
servicemen
and
i
don't
feel
that
this
right
should
be
taken
away
from
them
unilaterally,
administratively
and
retroactively.
the
prior
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims
have
been
that
it
takes
the
sentence
of
a
court-martial
to
forfeit
military
pay.
now,
the
defendant's
first
argument
is
that
this
is
not
a
forfeiture
or
an
administrative
forfeiture
because
there
was
a
de
novo
hearing
in
the
court
of
claims.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
one
of
the
findings
of
the
court
of
claims
was
that
the
administrative
finding
was
conclusive.
the
court
of
claims
says,
well
the
army
administratively
determined
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
pay.
that
is
conclusive
under
the
missing
persons
act,
and
therefore,
we
can't
consider
it.
certainly,
this
is
not
a
hearing
in
a
sense
of
giving
a
person
a
hearing.
the
second
point,
in
the
court
of
claims
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
yes.
in
the
court
of
claims'
decision
they
cite
the
case
of
--
i
can't
recall
it
but
they
cite
their
prior
case
which
holds
that
--
that
the
administrative
determination
on
the
department
of
the
army
is
conclusive.
the
second
point,
insofar
as
this
de
novo
hearing,
providing
the
hearing
with
the
--
soldier
should
have
is
this
burden
of
proof
lies
with
the
soldier.
in
other
words,
the
army
administratively
forfeits
pay
for
misconduct
and
then
tells
the
soldier
to
come
in
and
prove
in
the
court
of
claims
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
misconduct.
i
don't
feel
this
is
the
type
of
hearing
that
the
court
has
in
mind.
the
second
argument
the
defendants
raise
is
that
it's
not
a
forfeiture
because
it's
not
accrued
pay.
well,
this
requires
that
you,
the
members
of
the
court
to
interpolate
into
10
u.s.c.
846
the
requirement
of
good
conduct.
you
can
interpolate
into
any
statute.
if
you
take
the
regular
pay
of
military,
the
statute
that
provides
regular
military
pay
and
interpolate
into
that
good
conduct
can
say
any
soldier
who
does
not
conduct
himself
well
has
not
accrued
pay.
he
hasn't
earned
the
pay.
this
is
contrary
again
with
all
the
prior
cases
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
holding
of
the
lower
court
and
the
defendant's
arguments
is
that,
"the
essence
of
things.
these
men
were
not
in
captivity."
this
is
contrary
to
the
statement,
its
finding.
it's
contrary
to
all
of
the
prior
rulings
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
status
--
that
is
the
status
of
serviceman
cannot
be
unilaterally
abandoned.
i
think
i've
deviated
here.
the
court
of
claims
held
that
in
the
essence
of
things,
these
men
were
not
in
the
service
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
well,
that's
the
terminology
that
the
court
used
based
upon
these
alleged
acts
of
misconduct
in
the
essence
of
things,
they
were
not
in
the
service
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
their
status
until
january
24th
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
the
period
of
question
was
at
members
of
the
regular
army
of
the
united
states
confined
as
prisoners
of
war.
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
that
is
what
the
court
of
claims
held
your
honor,
in
the
essence
of
things;
they
were
not
in
the
service.
this
is
for
the
contrary
to
the
prior
holdings
of
this
court
relative
to
status
of
servicemen.
the
--
there
are
three
prior
cases
on
this
point
plus
many
others
in
re
grinly
and
in
re
morrison
and
wilson
versus
the
united
states
have
all
held
that
when
a
person
is
in
the
service,
his
status
–
when
a
citizen
is
enlisted
in
the
service,
he
acquires
a
status,
the
status
cannot
be
unilaterally
abandoned.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
by
the
only
way
of
status
of
the
service
--
of
being
in
the
service
can
be
terminated
is
by
a
discharge.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
discharge
can
be
based
on
--
you
have
three
types
of
administrative
discharges,
two
types
of
punitive
discharges.
punitive
discharges
must
be
given
by
court-martial
and
those
are
dishonorable
and
bad
conduct.
this
is
a
dishonorable
discharge
case
–
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
it
can,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
well,
an
honorable
discharge
is
an
administrative
discharge.
it
can
be
terminated
upon
expiration
of
enlistment
or
upon
anyone
of
various
other
things.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
the
dishonorable
discharge
is
a
punitive
discharge
and
can
only
be
given
by
a
court-martial.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
no,
there
was
no
court-martial
here
but
there
was
a
dishonorable
discharge.
that's
the
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
we
--
we
don't
express
opinion
on
it
your
honor.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
well,
i
don't'
feel
it's
relevant.
we
have
a
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
no,
we're
not
--
we're
not
asking
for
any
pay
after
the
discharge,
your
honor.
we're
only
asking
for
pay
prior
to
the
discharge
and
no
pay
was
forfeited
at
the
time
of
giving
discharge.
there
was
no
forfeiture
pay
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
if
the
court
please,
first
of
all
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
have
claimed
or
what
statutes
the
plaintiffs
--
plaintiffs
have
to
claim
under
a
cite
the
court
to
page
3
of
my
petition
that
page
point
it
says
paragraph
ix
that
these
claims
are
made
based
upon
section
323
of
title
37.
we've
claimed
under
--
not
only
both
of
the
pow
statutes
that
is
the
missing
persons
statute,
the
pow
statute
but
also
under
the
general
pay
statute.
they're
shown
in
paragraph
9
of
the
petition.
the
government
argues
that
pay
for
services
condition
of
entitlement,
but
it
does
not
specify
the
procedure
so
what
is
to
be
the
procedure?
the
administrative
--
the
dispersing
officer
decides
that
this
particular
soldier
has
not
rendered
faithful
service.
so,
he
unilaterally
and
administratively
forfeits
retroactively
that
pay.
who
was
to
check
the
dispersing
officer's
accuracy?
there
must
be
some
type
of
hearing
to
check
the
accuracy
of
this
dispersing
officer
or
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
man
has
been
guilty
of
misconduct.
the
man
certainly
should
be
entitled
to
be
heard
as
to
whether
or
not
he's
guilty
of
misconduct.
let's
say
for
example
that
they
make
this
a
condition
of
flight
pay.
suppose
good
and
faithful
service
is
a
condition
of
flight
pay
or
to
parallel
to
the
court
of
claims'
finding
that
the
military
or
dispersing
officer
might
say,
“yes,
this
man
was
flying
an
airplane”
but
in
the
essence
of
things,
he
was
not
flying.
therefore,
they
can
make
an
administrative
determination
that
in
the
essence
of
things,
he
was
not
flying
and
he
is
not
entitled
to
his
flight
pay
and
that
administrative
determination
according
to
the
court
of
claims
is
conclusive.
the
man
cannot
argue
the
point.
he
must
just
blindly
accept
their
word
for
it
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
yes
indeed.
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
case
your
honor.
i
just
in
fact
--
i
think
the
essence
of
the
case
here
is
whether
or
not
you
can
have
the
unilateral
breach
of
the
contract.
now
i
cite
the
court's
attention
to
--
again
to
page
32
of
my
rebuttal
brief
and
not
only
citing
the
grimley
case,
the
morrissey
case,
the
wilson
case,
but
also
listen
to
the
words
the
court
of
military
appeals,
an
agreement
to
enlist
in
the
armed
services
is
often
referred
to
as
a
contract
(inaudible)
more
than
a
contractual
relationship
is
established.
what
has
really
created
is
a
status
and
as
a
result,
no
useful
purpose
is
served
by
reviewing
common
law
rules
of
contract.
(inaudible)
status,
when
a
person
was
mustered
into
the
service
and
has
not
been
mustered
out
of
the
service,
he's
entitled
--
he
is
in
a
status
as
member
of
the
military;
these
men
have
not
been
mustered,
(inaudible)
were
not
mustered
out
of
the
service
from
1954.
we
are
only
asking
for
pay
up
until
the
date
that
they
were
mustered
out
of
the
service.
the
court
in
the
court
of
claims
which
i
think
is
the
preponderance
of
the
basic
rule
and
this
says
aside
from
this,
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
number
of
cases
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
officer
or
soldier
is
under
charge,
does
not
deprive
him
of
allowances
and
such
forfeiture
can
only
be
imposed
by
way
of
lawful
court-martial.
as
above
stated,
the
uniform
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
that
it
requires
the
decision
of
the
court-martial
to
deprive
an
officer
of
his
pay
and
many
other
cases
cited
along
those
same
lines.
one
other
quick
point
that
being
the
question
of
did
we
or
did
we
ask
for
the
come
back
pay.
i
cite
the
court's
attention
to
pages
15
and
16
of
my
rebuttal
brief
where
--
where
the
stipulation
as
to
damages
has
laid
out
and
the
initial
petition
by
all
by
demand
by
mr.
brown
for
the
back
pay
of
these
men,
he
asked
for
“all
their
back
pay”
which
included
combat
regular
pay.
in
my
opening
brief
at
page
80,
opening
brief
to
the
court
of
claims,
i
ask
for
the
come
back
regular
pay
that's
on
page
85
--
8
to
15
of
my
opening
brief
to
the
court
of
claims.
the
stipulation
of
damages
which
was
before
the
court
of
claims
--
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
or
alternative
(inaudible),
yes
or
alternatively,
some
other
type
of
hearing.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
well,
it's
not
provided
for
in
the
statutes,
your
honor
because
i
don't
see
how
they
could
have
another
type
of
forfeiture
under
the
court-martial.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
that
should
be
--
it
would
have
to
be
by
court-martial
if
possible.
one
more
alternative
would
be
this
fine
assessment
by
a
district
court
in
(inaudible),
they
could
find
that
in
the
district
court
more
than
their
back
pay.
mr.
robert
e.
hannon
it
wouldn't
be
a
forfeiture.
the
only
way
you
have
a
forfeiture
use
from
the
technical
sense
is
by
a
court-martial
conviction
and
under
the
statute
cited
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
this
can
only
apply
now
to
pay
accruing
on
and
after
the
date
of
(inaudible).
i
think
that
the
proper
way
to
dispose
of
this
case
is
to
refer
to
the
court
i
think
the
best
long
subject
that's
being
left
--
used
by
the
court
of
claims
in
white
versus
the
united
states.
practically,
the
same
issue
was
before
the
court
there
and
the
court
states
that
what
we
think
be
an
almost
proceedings
to
permit
this
(inaudible)
to
the
court
we
ascertain
whether
under
all
of
the
various
provisions
with
respect
to
pay
and
allowances
of
officers
men
of
the
army,
navy
and
marine
corps
investigation
should
obtain
to
determine
whether
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
soldier
had
by
conscientious
service
earned
that
the
statutory
provision
will
allow
it.
again,
i
should
like
to
repeat
that
i
think
the
most
significant
effect
of
this
case
is
the
effect
on
future
service
men.
if
the
army
can
unilaterally,
administratively
and
retroactively
forfeit
a
truth
pay
whether
they
say
the
--
they're
not
in
the
status
or
whether
they
create
a
condition
in
the
statute
by
interpolation
we
have
put
the
man
in
a
totally
untenable
position.
the
dispersing
officer
said
he's
not
entitled
to
pay
and
wasn't
entitled
to
pay
for
the
past
four
months.
the
man
then
must
go
forward
with
insurmountable
burden
of
establishing
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
misconduct.
i
think
that
again
this
is
an
unjust
and
inequitable
burden
to
place
upon
any
serviceman.
i
think
that
the
law
is
and
has
been
that
as
long
as
the
man
is
in
service,
he
is
in
the
status
of
being
in
the
service
and
those
persons
from
the
status
of
being
in
the
service
are
entitled
to
payment
provided
to
the
office.
the
payment
provided
for
the
office
in
this
situation,
he
is
never
in
the
service
from
the
date
of
--
prior
to
their
capture
until
the
date
of
their
--
dishonorable
discharge.
i
feel
that
that
being
the
case
they
are
entitled
to
pay
of
the
office.
thank
you
very
much.
