mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
since
the
main
thrust
of
the
government's
argument
has
been
directed
at
this
question
that
congress
was
following
a
long
doctrine
in
conspiracy
substantive
offense
cases,
i
think
the
first
thing
i
should
direct
my
attention
to
is
this
long
doctrine
and
it's
this.
this
long
doctrine
which
mr.
gilinsky
refers
to
in
all
of
the
cases
with
the
possible
exception
of
this
court-martial
case
did
the
issue
of
cumulative
sentences
arise?
all
these
cases
merely
held
that
a
conspiracy
and
a
substantive
offense
are
separate
and
distinct
crimes.
in
this
respect,
let
me
start
out
with
the
pinkerton
case
and
the
american
tobacco
case,
which
were
decided
in
june
1946,
subsequent
to
the
time
the
hobbs
act
was
passed
the
house
and
prior
to
the
final
passage
in
the
senate.
and
in
this
connection,
it
in
both
pinkerton
and
--
and
the
american
tobacco
company
case,
the
issue
was
that
this
court
had
decided,
braverman
versus
united
states,
with
--
which
held
the
issue
in
the
braverman
case
was,
suppose
you
have
a
conspiracy,
one
conspiracy
to
commit
various
substantive
offenses,
what
sort
of
punishment
maybe
imposed?
and
the
court
in
the
braverman
case,
held
that
the
--
you
only
could
punish
the
conspiracy
and
the
maximum
punishment
was
the
punishment
authorized
by
the
conspiracy
section
--
statute.
then
in
both
the
pinkerton
and
the
american
tobacco
case,
they
argued
the
converse.
they
said,
here,
we
have
a
whole
group
of
substantive
offenses
which
were
committed
pursuant
to
one
conspiracy.
therefore,
they
argued,
there
is
a
merger
and
therefore,
we
should
not
be
punished
more
than
the
punishment
for
the
one
conspiracy.
and
this
court
held
no,
that
the
--
that
there
could
be
punishment
for
each
of
the
substantive
offenses.
now
also,
because
i
think
it
has
some
bearing
on
this,
in
the
pinkerton
case,
the
court
decided
there
was
a
conflict
of
circuits
that
a
--
a
conspirator
who
did
not
participate
in
the
substantive
offense,
might
be
guilty
of
the
substantive
offense.
prior
to
that
time,
some
circuits
have
said
yes
and
some
no.
now,
the
other
cases
relative
to
the
separateness
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense
were
in
general
cases
which
said
that
a
conspiracy
might
be
subject
to
a
general
statute
or
limitations
and
the
substantive
offense
to
a
special
statute
of
limitation
that
a
conspiracy
wasn't
petty
offense,
that
a
--
a
conspiracy
could
be
punished
more
severely
than
the
substantive
offense
or
that
punishment
that
congress
had
the
power,
therefore,
there
was
no
double
jeopardy
to
punish
separately,
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense.
that
the
punishment,
again,
with
the
punishment
for
conspiracy
would
be
greater
than
a
substantive
offense
that
a
clear
--
that
liability
for
conspiracy
is
not
taken
away
by
its
excess
and
a
conspiracy
may
have
a
different
statute
of
limitation.
and
none
of
these
cases
except
for
this
carter
case,
which
was
a
basically,
a
double
jeopardy
case
did
they
state
that
cumulative
punishment
might
be
imposed.
now,
this
carter
versus
mcclaughry
was
a
court-martial
case.
there
were
four
charges.
under
two
of
the
charges,
there
was
a
--
which
arose
under
one
article
of
war,
the
--
they
--
this
article
of
war
had
been
based
on
a
statute
which
provided
a
fine
and
a
punishment
for
conspiring
and
also
for
making
false
claims.
when
--
when
the
article
of
war
was
enacted,
the
words
became
fine
or
punishment
and
carter
paid
the
fine
and
he
contended
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
released
because
he
had
served
--
that
he
had
complied
with
the
sentence
and
he
couldn't
receive
both
a
fine
or
a
punishment.
the
court
first
said
that
when
the
statute
used
the
word
--
oh,
when
the
article
of
war
used
the
word
“or”
it
meant
and.
but
then
they
said,
in
any
event
there's
no
double
jeopardy.
furthermore,
as
in
old
court-martial
cases,
carter
received
the
gross
sentence
and
there
was
a
--
a
charge
under
--
charge
for
in
this
particular
case,
in
which
he
was
sentenced
for
embezzlement
and
the
entire
sentence
could
have
been
sustained
on
the
embezzlement
charge.
now,
in
connection
with
this
problem
of
merger
--
now,
we
don't
say
just
because
a
--
there
is
a
conspiracy
and
a
substantive
offense,
that
they
automatically
merge
in
sort
of
put
to
--
blinders
on
the
court
and
say,
well
the
court
can't
consider
the
legislative
history.
we
say
rather
that
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
consider
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
legislation
and
if
the
purpose
and
intent
is
to
punish
as
a
unit,
then
no
cumulative
punishment
can
be
imposed.
now,
the
real
--
i
mean,
just
i
go
back
at
second,
in
connection
with
this
problem
of
whether
that
--
of
this
long
standing
doctrine
that
the
government
argues,
we
set
forth
a
committee
report
in
1944,
this
is
on
page
25
of
our
appendix.
this
is
a
committee
report
in
which
the
congress
in
1944
had
the
problem
that
in
counterfeiting
cases,
the
ring
leaders
were
only
being
sentenced
to
two
years
for
the
--
for
conspiring
to
violate
the
counterfeiting
laws
and
the
participants
were
being
sentenced
for
sometimes
as
much
as
the
maximum
which
was
15
years,
for
committing
a
substantive
offense.
so
the
result,
the
--
the
congress
enacted
a
law
in
which
they
made
a
conspiracy
to
violate
the
counterfeit
laws
subject
to
the
same
penalty,
15
years
as
the
substantive
offense.
nowhere
is
there
an
indication
that
what
they
were
doing
was
not
making
a
15-year
penalty,
but
making
a
30-year
penalty.
and
we're
just
--
we
put
this
in
for
an
illustration
to
show
that
this
doctrine
wasn't
--
wasn't
well-established
like
mr.
gilinsky
states
it
is.
now,
when
we
look
to
the
purpose
and
intent
of
this
legislation
and
that's
what
--
what
i
think
the
main
problem
is
in
any
legislation,
when
we
start
out,
we
see
that
initially,
there
was
an
investigation
and
--
into
racketeering
and
the
--
there
were
hearings
held.
there
was
testimony
given
in
which
an
attorney
general
and
several
--
and
another
professor
defined
racketeering
and
they
defined
that
crime,
as
a
crime
committed
by
organized
groups.
and
then
eventually,
mr.
rice
of
the
attorney
general's
office,
set
forth,
draft
--
and
made
the
first
draft
of
the
measure
and
in
the
first
draft
of
the
measure,
there
was
no
conspiracy
clause
and
he
specifically
stated
the
reason
while
that
--
while
the
act
was
directed
primarily
against
groups
--
group
action,
that
the
reason
he
excluded
the
combination
was
to
ease
the
proof.
and
then
subsequently,
when
labor
objected
to
the
bill,
they
--
it
was,
mr.
cummings,
drafted
it
a
second
time
and
in
that
draft
which
also
had
this
99-year
penalty,
the
--
the
conspiracy
section
was
added.
but
the
--
the
whole
purpose
of
the
--
the
legislation,
was
to
--
to
hit
at
these
groups
and
--
and
to
prevent
them
from
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
and
then
also
when
--
when
the
legislation,
the
1946
act
was
enacted,
its
history
also
was
directed
at
practices
against
groups.
local
807
case
was
a
conspiracy
case.
the
entire
discussion
of
the
--
of
--
of
congress
in
the
--
in
the
--
based
on
the
1946
act,
was
directed
at
this
group
combined
action.
now,
we
say
that
this
is
the
controlling
gloss.
the
controlling
gloss
is
that
congress
wished
to
cover
these
groups
and
to
punish
the
groups
and
that
the
only
reason
for
adding
this
conspiracy
section
and
for
adding
these
various
alternative
substantive
provisions
which
overlap,
was
so
that
everybody
who
participated
in
any
aspect
of
the
crime
would
be
punished.
in
other
words,
congress
was
interested
in
easing
the
burning
--
burden
of
proof.
they
--
it
was
not
interested
in
piling
punishment
upon
punishment.
certainly,
we
don't
--
we
do
not
think
that
this
statute
--
we
think
that
the
available
materials
indicate
that
congress
did
not
intend
cumulative
punishment.
we
think
that
if
--
if
anybody
in
the
1942
and
1943
debates
had
thought
that
congress
intended
cumulative
punishment,
they
would
have
indicated
and
argued
that
the
bill
so
provided.
when
you
consider
that
factor
that
congress'
main
concern
was
with
combination
and
wasn't
primary
combinations
that
interfered
with
interstate
commerce,
when
you
consider
that
factor,
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
when
considering
with
that
purpose,
indicates
that
no
consecutive
punishment
was
intended.
in
any
event,
that
there's
no
reason
for
not
--
for
treating
this
separate
mistake
from
any
other
case
where
there
are
two
substantive
offenses
involved,
the
same
policy
considerations
are
involved
for
applying
the
rule
of
--
lenity.
the
--
the
fact
that
--
that
a
combination
might
be
a
greater
evil,
it
doesn't
have
any
additional
weight
in
this
sentence,
in
this
legislation,
because
the
combination
itself
was
the
evil
at
which
the
substantive
offense
was
directed
and
the
only
reason
that
combination
was
not
required
as
an
element
was
to
ease
the
proof
and
to
make
all
violators
in
any
degree,
and
all
inchoate
crimes
punishable
and
for
that
reason,
we
think
the
court
below
erred
in
imposing
cumulative
punishments.
