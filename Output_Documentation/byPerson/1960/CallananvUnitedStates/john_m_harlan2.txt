justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
quoted
in
your
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
cases
are
there
that
--
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
was
going
to
ask
you
about
cases
that
where
that
doctrine
was
applied,
where
the
conspiracies
offense
was
part
of
the
same
statute
enacted
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
draw
a
distinction
under
the
hobbs
act
between
cumulative
punishments
where
a
conspiracy
and
a
substantive
offense
is
alleged
in
the
situation
where
two
substantive
offenses
under
the
hobbs
act
are
--
do
you
think
that
line
can
be
drawn
or
are
you
arguing
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i
was
really
to
asking
you,
do
you
lay
special
emphasis
on
your
argument
on
the
fact,
on
this
conspiracy
doctrine?
the
general
conspiracy
doctrine
or
does
your
argument
go
to
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
i'm
--
perhaps
i
haven't
made
myself
clear.
this
is
a
conspiracy
against
a
substantive
offense,
cumulative
sentences
in
that
context.
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
you
think
there
is
a
difference
as
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
act
in
that
kind
of
a
context
and
what
would
be
the
case
if
cumulative
sentences
on
two
substantive
offenses
under
the
statute
were
involved?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now
we're
talking
here
about
power
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
question
is
this.
you
lay
great
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
congress
must
be
taken
to
have
acted
with
reference
to
the
established
doctrine
that
conspiracies
and
substantive
offenses
or
different
crimes.
and
my
question
is,
do
you
think
that
that
--
that
the
conspiracy
versus
substantive
offense
problem
stands
on
a
different
footing
under
this
act
than
with
a
case
of
cumulative
punishment
involving
only
substantive
offenses
under
the
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
do
think
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
my
question
to
you
again
a
little
more
concretely.
supposing
this
indictment
had
charged
two
substantive
offenses
and
a
conspiracy,
three
counts,
and
cumulative
sentences
will
impose
on
all
three
counts.
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
permissible
reading
of
the
act
to
say
that
as
far
as
conspiracy
versus
substantive
counts,
yes,
congress
must
be
taken
to
have
intended
cumulative
punishments,
authorized
cumulative
punishments,
but
with
respect
to
the
two
substantive
accounts,
it
cannot
be
so
taken
to
have
intended?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
--
i
think
your
view
is
to
whether
there's
a
difference
between
the
approach
that
the
court
should
take
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
if
there
is
any
difference.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
have
indicted
him
under
the
general
--
general
conspiracy
statute
now?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
no
over
--
overt
act
required
under
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
put
your
contention
in
another
way,
as
i
get
it,
you
say
this
situation
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
congress
instead
of
adding
a
conspiracy
section
to
the
hobbs
act
with
a
20-year
facet
of
sentence
to
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
had
amended
the
general
conspiracy
statute
by
saying
that
penalty
was
to
five
years
except
in
the
case
of
hobbs
act
violations.
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
to
get
to
that
point,
what
your
answer
to
your
adversary's
argument
that
this
is
a
difficult
case
where
the
rule
--
strict
construction
and
the
rule
of
lenity,
sometimes
cause
you
difficulty.
justice
john
m.
harlan
assume
--
assume
that
when
everything
is
said
and
done,
one
comes
to
the
conclusion
fairly
that
you
can't
make
head
or
tail
out
of
what
congress
did
intend
to
do,
then
why
do
you
say,
prevents
the
application
in
the
rule
that
your
adversary
is
relying
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
i
was
prompted
to
it
by
your
last
colloquy
with
the
chief
justice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
you
said
that
you
couldn't
--
frankly,
yes,
i
think
you
said
you
couldn't
--
the
congress
didn't
advert
to
this
problem.
