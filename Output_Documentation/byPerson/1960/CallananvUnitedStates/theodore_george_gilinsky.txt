mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
preliminary
question
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
which
i
will
not
discuss
unless
some
justices
have
some
questions
about
it.
it
has
to
do
with
the
choice
of
the
remedy
in
this
particular
case
and
the
government
concedes
that
under
rule
35,
if
this
is
an
illegal
sentence
that
that
is
a
proper
approach
to
the
problem
and
it
can
be
settled
under
that
rule
and
he
didn't
get
in
to
the
other
problems
of
how
to
go
at
it.
now,
their
main
question
and
only
one
to
which
agree
is
here,
is
whether
a
person
who
has
conspired
to
violate
the
hobbs
anti-racketeering
act
and
then
also
extorts
money
from
the
victim
which
is
a
violation
of
the
hobbs
anti-racketeering
act,
can
be
sentenced
for
both
crimes
under
this
act.
now,
the
facts,
i
think,
while
they've
been
mentioned,
might
take
a
little
--
a
minute
to
clarify.
there
are
two
counts
involved
here.
first
count
was
for
was
for
conspiracy
and
the
second
count
was
a
substantive
crime
of
extortion.
the
petitioner
and
others
are
--
were
convicted
by
a
jury.
the
sentence
was
12
years
on
count
i.
on
count
ii,
the
sentence
was
a
consecutive
sentence
of
12
years
which
was
suspended
and
then
the
petitioner
was
placed
on
probation
for
five
years.
the
five-year
probation
period
begins
at
the
end
of
the
sentence
on
count
i.
as
a
matter
of
fact
now,
of
course,
the
petitioner
is
out
on
parole
even
from
the
first
sentence
and
it
is
our
--
and
the
only
reason
we
mention
this
is
because
while
the
petitioner
originally
was
confined,
when
he
started
this
proceeding
and
therefore
he
asked
only
for
four
years
off
of
his
first
sentence.
now
that
he
is
no
longer
confined,
we
can
recognize
that
he
has
nothing
as
great
to
gain
by
getting
only
four
years
off
the
sentence.
consequently,
both
sides
have
somewhat
changed
since
the
beginning.
so
that
now,
the
problem
is
in
total,
we
see
it
whether
or
not,
you
can
have
cumulative
sentences
under
this
act,
regardless
of
the
length,
the
particular
length
that
they
may
happen
to
have.
now,
we
both
use
the
same
material,
it's
true.
we
both
cite
the
same
cases.
we
both
have
the
same
facts.
now,
we
approach
the
problem
from
a
different
view.
if
i
may
characterize
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
both.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
suppose.
the
petitioner
feels
as
i
--
as
we
see
the
petitioner's
argument,
he
feels
that
if
the
statute
or
the
act
as
a
whole,
does
not
say
in
so
many
words
that
cumulative
sentences
may
not
be
imposed
and
if
the
legislative
history
does
not
say
in
so
many
words
that
cumulative
sentences
may
not
be
imposed,
that
therefore,
there's
an
ambiguity
and
therefore,
you
use
a
rule
of
lenity
and
decide
that
only
20
years
can
be
imposed.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
says
both
though.
i
think
on
that
part
of
the
argument,
i
think
all
he's
saying
is
that
the
people
--
not
--
this
is
not
the
original
act,
the
--
the
quotations
that
he
has
given
you.
quotations
from
the
legislative
history
that
were
recited
here
are
from
the
hobbs
act.
we
already
have
the
problem
in
1934.
if
there
is
a
problem
here,
it
arises
long
before
the
hobbs
bill
becomes
the
law
because
in
1934,
this
conspiracy
clause
is
also
here.
now,
this
recitation
of
history
to
us
should
be
read
as
merely
the
same
thing
that
the
bill
says.
the
bill
says
that
a
man
should
be
punished
for
20
years.
congressmen
were
saying
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
bill
said.
we
don't
think
this
settles
the
problem
at
all,
because
just
to
reiterate
what
the
bill
itself
says
doesn't
add
to
the
--
to
our
knowledge
of
what
the
intent
was
insofar
as
cumulative
sentences
are
concerned.
now,
what
do
i
mean
when
i
say
that
the
government
starts
at
the
opposite
end?
we
feel
that
this
great
history,
judicial
history
of
conspiracy
and
substantive
crimes
and
there
are
decades
of
judicial
decisions
on
this
as
separate
crimes,
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
passage
of
this
act.
in
other
words,
would
you
read
the
1934
act,
it
wasn't
passed
in
vacuum.
it
wasn't
passed
by
itself.
it
had
before
it
a
long
history
of
conspiracy
crimes
and
a
long
history
of
substantive
crimes.
that
with
this
history
and
since
they
have
always
been
treated
in
the
federal
courts
and
in
this
country
as
separate
crimes,
there
was
no
occasion
for
congress
to
say
anything
about
cumulative
sentences,
if
they
meant
to
impose
the
same
type
of
punishment
they
always
had
been
imposing.
it
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes.
no,
it
came
out
of
the
judiciary.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
--
i
think
you
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
i
think
to
get
to
the
1934
act,
i
think
we
have
the
first
clue.
first
of
all,
the
background
is
that
in
--
from
1879
on,
this
court
has
maintained
a
consistent
pattern
of
cases
involving
both
the
crimes
of
conspiracy
and
the
crime
of
a
substantive
act
and
in
each
and
every
case
since
1879,
that
this
court
has
had
the
problem.
this
court
has
held
that
the
conspiracy
is
separate
from
the
substantive
crime
and
that
the
punishment
can
be
accumulated.
now,
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief
from
that
first
case,
the
various
facets
of
the
argument.
in
other
words,
it
made
no
difference
how
the
argument
arrived
here,
whether
it
arrived
because
someone
claimed
double
jeopardy,
whether
it
arrived
because
there
was
a
different
statute
of
limitations
to
be
applied,
whether
it
arrived
because
the
person
that
was
being
tried
for
conspiracy
could
not
be
charged
with
the
substantive
or
whether
it
arrived
because
there
were
different
types
of
punishments
for
the
substantive
as
compared
to
the
conspiracy.
no
matter
how
the
case
arrived
here,
in
other
words
and
i
may
i
had
it
at
this
point,
even
if
it's
in
the
same
act,
no
matter
how
the
case
arrived,
this
court
always
held
that
the
conspiracy
was
separate
from
the
substantive
offense
and
could
be
cumulative
punishment.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
let
me
--
let
me
get
to
latter
ones
because
i
think
they're
the
--
the
closest
in
time.
the
last
two
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
yes,
i
can
give
you
two
cases
of
that.
the
first
case
that
we
have
is
a
case
of
carter
versus
mcclaughry.
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
conspiracy
and
this
--
and
the
substantive
offense
were
both
in
the
same
act.
they
were
an
article
of
war.
this
was
a
court-martial.
the
case
arrived
here
as
a
habeas
corpus
case.
this
court
held
that
he
could
be
punished
for
both
cumulatively
and
that
act
is
exactly
the
same
type
of
wording
and
differentiation
as
the
hobbs
act.
but
going
further
and
getting
more
to
the
problem
even
that
this
case
poses,
is
when
you
arrive
at
such
things
as
the
sherman
act,
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
contains
in
its
language,
the
same
types
of
offenses
namely,
monopoly,
attempt
to
monopolize
or
conspire.
that's
all
within
one
section.
this
is
somewhat
similar
to
the
present
wording
of
this
act.
even
in
this
case
then
we
find
cumulative
punishments
and
that's
american
tobacco
company
cited
in
our
brief,
where
this
court
held
in
so
many
words
that
they
could
be
punished
cumulatively,
under
section
2
for
the
conspiracy
as
well
as
for
the
monopoly.
this
court
held
in
that
connection
that
the
attempt
merged
into
the
monopoly,
but
they
did
not
hold
that
the
conspiracy
merged
into
it.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
american
tobacco,
328
u.s.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
american
tobacco
had
four
counts.
count
i
was
under
section
1,
conspiracy
under
section
i,
count
ii
was
monopoly,
a
substantive
crime
of
monopoly,
count
iii
was
the
attempt
to
monopolize
and
count
iv
was
a
conspiracy.
american
tobacco
was
cumulatively
fined.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
section
2,
all
within
--
leaving
aside
section
1,
which
is
conspiracy,
there
were
three
counts
under
section
2,
two
which
survived
for
punishment
purposes
and
received
cumulative
punishments.
if
as
my
--
if
as
the
petitioner
feels,
this
act
came
because
of
the
--
the
problem
confronting
the
antitrust
laws
or
the
sherman
act,
then
certainly,
if
this
is
part
of
the
prototype
for
this
act,
then
certainly
we
should
have
the
same
type
of
interpretation
of
intent
insofar
as
the
hobbs
act
is
concerned.
if
you
can
punish
for
the
substantive
crime
and
the
conspiracy
in
one
act
and
you
say,
you
take
part
--
at
least
this
is
an
impetuous
to
the
second
act,
then
certainly
you
should
be
able
to
do
the
same
under
the
second
act.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
the
line
can
be
drawn.
i
don't
think
it
--
i
don't
--
we
don't
argue
it
because
we
think
that
any
--
anyone
who
violates
an
act
a
number
of
times,
can
get
cumulative
punishment.
i
don't
know
that
that
has
ever
been
the
type
of
problem.
i
mean,
for
instance,
even
in
a
--
a
case
which
has
a
merger
problem
such
as
prince
or
the
bank
robbery
statute,
i
don't
know
of
anyone
saying
that
if
you
rob
a
bank
and
then
five,
six
months
later,
rob
another
bank,
that
you
can
get
double
sentence
because
of
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
we
don't
think
there's
any
difference
between
the
fact
that
this
is
all
in
one
act
and
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't,
we
think
they
have
to
be
treated
the
same,
although,
in
answer
to
the
problem
which
is
being
presented
here,
we
--
we
find
even
the
cases
under
one
act,
treating
them
as
separate.
so,
we
don't
see
this
difference
in
the
fact
that
it's
one
act
would
make
any
difference
and
we
think,
it's
backed
up
for
the
legislative
history
that
interpretation
we
think
it's
backed
up
by
the
cases
or
maybe
i'm
not
understanding
your
question.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
those
considerations
go
to
punishment.
in
other
words,
i
think
those
considerations
can
be
taken
into
account
why
the
trial
judge
in
determining
how
much
punishment
under
an
act
a
man
should
get.
i
do
not
think
they
go
to
the
question
of
what
can
be
given
under
the
act.
have
i
made
myself
clear
on
the
--
in
other
words,
i
think
there
are
considerations
of
punishment
such
as
this
case
as
an
example,
here,
suppose
we
have
in
this
case,
only
--
only
one
sentence
of
20
years,
this
petitioner
wouldn't
even
be
out
of
jail
because
the
parole
board
couldn't
look
at
the
sentence
until
he
served
at
least
a
third.
that
isn't
what
happened
in
this
case.
petitioner
received
a
12-year
sentence
so
that
parole
board
could
look
at
the
problem
earlier
and
he
did
get
out
too.
in
other
words,
i
think
on
the
related
circumstances
--
that
was
whether
he
commits
number
of
crimes
or
whether
it
is
a
conspiracy
with
the
objective
which
is
the
substantive
crime,
all
of
those
considerations
can
go
to
the
question
of
how
much
punishment.
i
do
not
think
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
so.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
so.
i
think
i
have
to
say,
yes,
because
of
this.
i
think
there
is
a
greater
legal
history
for
the
separation
of
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
crime
of
extortion,
than
there
is
for
example,
between
two
parts
of
this
act,
one
of
which
is
violence
and
the
substantive
crime.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
is
a
greater,
legal
background
for
considering
conspiracy
as
separate
from
the
substantive
offense,
than
there
is
if
we
had
the
problem
of
someone
who
was
indicted
for
violence
and
for
the
substantive
crime.
well,
i
think,
the
question
of
power
would
be
answered
the
same
in
both.
the
--
may
i
finish
the
background
of
the
cases
in
the
field
of
separateness?
from
the
time
this
court
decided
pinkerton
versus
the
united
states
in
1946,
which
posed
a
question
in
terms
of
cumulative
punishment,
this
court
was
able
to
say
it
has
been
long
and
consistently
recognized
by
the
court
that
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense
and
a
conspiracy
to
commit
it,
are
separate
and
distinct
offenses.
in
pereira
versus
the
united
states,
which
this
court
decided
in
1954,
this
court
was
able
to
say,
"it
is
settled
law
in
this
country
that
the
commission
of
a
substantive
offense
and
a
conspiracy
to
commit
it
are
separate
and
distinct
crimes."
from
all
of
these,
we
attribute
to
congress
a
passive
purpose
in
the
absence
of
any
direct
expression
to
the
contrary
that
congress
was
going
to
maintain
the
long
established
distinctions
between
offenses
that
are
essentially
different.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
the
answer
would
be
the
same
as
far
as
the
government
is
concerned.
i
think
the
question
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
meant
that
there
is
a
different
background
to
the
problem
of
conspiracy.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
are
none,
no
difference.
no
difference
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
we
--
if
we
don't
just
have
the
statute,
just
at
the
statute,
there
would
be
no
reason
at
all,
to
provide
a
punishment,
the
all
of
--
all
the
punishments
in
this
statute
are
today,
are
20
years.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
apply
a
20-year
sentence
to
the
crime
of
violence
in
connection
with
this.
that
is
not
separate
and
distinct
from
the
substantive
offense
because
we
have
in
the
statute
the
substantive
or
the
attempt.
now
certainly
or
the
--
or
the
conspiracy,
certainly
because
some
persons
conspires
to
violate
the
act,
this
should
not
be
construed
as
giving
him
immunity
from
using
violence,
nor
should
this
be
construed
as
giving
him
immunity
from
any
punishment
for
or
having
completed
the
--
the
extortion.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
have
a
separate
punishment
if
you
couldn't
separately
punish
the
person
for
it.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
have
this
in
the
statute
at
all,
because
a
crime
of
violence
wouldn't
have
anything.
you
can
have
an
attempt
at
extortion
and
the
violence
can
be
a
part
of
that.
and
if
that's
all
there
is,
you
can
sentence
the
man
to
20
--
as
a
matter
of
power,
you
can
sentence
the
man
to
20
years
for
the
attempt.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
because
violence
is
a
part
and
parcel.
it
isn't
true
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
it
isn't.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
understand.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
understand.
none,
of
the
--
in
--
in
this
--
in
this
sense
which
you
are
talking,
none
of
these
crimes
necessarily
overlap
at
all,
because
there
is
no
question
that
people
can
conspire
to
violate
this
act
and
never
extort
anything.
not
even
--
and
we
could
not
possibly
even
charge
them
with
an
attempt.
at
the
same
time,
it's
very
clear
under
the
act
and
there
are
cases
on
this
that
a
single
person
can
extort,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
difficult
about
recognizing
that.
a
single
person
can
extort
under
this
act
and
certainly,
you
would
have
no
conspiracy
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
--
i
understand
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
understand
this
part
but,
i
--
i
think
there
are
two
approaches
to
the
problem.
my
--
my
problem
--
well,
maybe
this
way
and
suppose
as
an
advocate,
i
--
i
should
bring
forth
all
the
possible
approaches.
i
think
there
are
differences
in
the
approaches.
i
understand
yours
and
i
have
--
what
you
have
said
and
i
think
i
have
said
that,
but
i
think
there's
also
this
other
possibility
and
i
--
i
can't
just
--
there's
only
one.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
now,
there's
another
type
of
gloss
i
think
on
the
statute
besides
this
long
decades
of
history
of
separateness
between
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
crime.
and
that
is
this
one
act
problem.
there
are
cases
long
before
1934,
now
i'm
talking
about
where
within
the
same
path,
we
have
cumulative
punishment
so
that
this
is
not
anything
new
either.
now,
we
cite
this
in
our
brief
also.
this
is
such
things
burton
versus
the
united
states
and
albrecht
which
--
which
had
been
before
this
court.
in
other
words,
possession
and
sale
of
liquor
under
one
of
the
cases
can
both
be
punished
separately.
burton
was
agreeing
to
receive
a
bribe
and
receiving
a
bribe.
and
that
type
of
case
all
within
an
act
in
other
words,
we
have
this
type
of
gloss.
all
of
these
support
cumulative
sentences
including
the
sherman
act
interpretation
in
the
american
tobacco
case,
which
i
have
given.
now,
a
word
on
a
problem
of
merger;
in
this
particular
field
of
conspiracy
and
substantive
offense
for
the
doctrine
of
merger
has
never
--
has
never
gained
a
porthole
in
the
federal
courts
and
in
none
of
the
states
presently,
do
you
have
any
such
doctrine
of
merger.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
pinkerton
versus
the
united
states,
this
court
said
very
clearly
that
the
doctrine
of
merger
does
not
hold
in
this
country.
of
course,
in
common
law,
there
was
a
type
of
merger
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
that
we
have.
it
had
to
do
with
a
procedural
problem
namely,
that
a
common
law
on
the
conspiracy
was
a
misdemeanor.
and
so,
the
misdemeanor
was
held
to
merge
into
the
felony
and
this
was
a
procedural
problem
in
order
to
avoid
questions
of
allowing
him
to
have
copies
of
the
indictment,
allowing
him
to
have
attorneys
and
so
forth.
this
type
of
doctrine,
although
early
applied
in
some
states,
had
since
been
change
in
those
states
and
as
far
as
i
know,
is
held
nowhere
in
the
united
states.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
can't
say
that
you
can't
read
it
that
way.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
the
thing
that
bothers
me
is
that
in
the
context
in
which
these
cases
arise,
the
question
of
power
goes
to
the
offense.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
type
of
offense
unless
you
have
the
type
of
offense
where
you
have
a
merger
problem.
in
other
words,
i
don't
view
conspiracy
as
anything
but
a
criminal
offense
and
i
don't
view
extortion
as
anything
but
a
criminal
offense
and
hence,
the
question
of
whether
there
are
two
or
three
substantives
and
one
conspiracy,
i
view
all
on
an
equal
basis
and
an
unquestionable
power
to
punish.
i
would
say
they
all
can
be
punished
at
the
same
time.
now,
i
can
recognize
that
it
is
easier
to
visualize
as
--
possibly
because
as
lawyers,
it
is
easier
to
visualize
separate
substantive
offenses
as
being
somewhat
different
than
a
conspiracy
and
a
substantive
offense.
and
i
think
that
is
--
that
difference
i
can
recognize.
but
i
don't
think
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
it
does
go
to
either
of
these
two
but
it
doesn't
go
to
a
question
whether
you
can
separately
punish
and
it
doesn't
aid
us
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
congress
in
this
act
intended
one
way
or
the
other.
i
can
recognize
there
is
a
different
view.
but
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
--
i
recognize
this.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
was
going
to
say
that
the
reason
for
this
long
recognition
is
--
is
just
this
purpose
that
the
combination
is
the
thing
that
--
that
we
are
after
here.
for
example,
in
this
particular
case,
the
fact
that
this
petitioner
has
joined
with
others
in
order
to
bring
a
--
a
greater
force
to
bear
upon
his
extortion
efforts
is
the
thing
that
the
conspiracy
count
is
after.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
agree.
i
--
i
think
there
are
other
considerations
for
the
conspiracy
also.
for
instance,
in
this
particular
context,
conspiracy
is
a
very
dangerous
anti-social
act
because
in
--
in
the
field
of
racketeering,
it
presents
a
focal
point
for
continuing
crime,
which
you
don't
usually
have
in
other
areas.
it
also
--
a
conspiracy
has
this
as
a
background.
it
makes
it
much
more
difficult
for
anyone
individual
to
get
out
because
he
has
the
--
his
cohorts
of
course,
on
his
back.
all
of
these
considerations
though
have
gone
into
the
long
history
of
why
conspiracy
is
separate
from
the
substantive
offense.
in
this
particular
act,
we
think
though
that
even
the
legislative
history
backs
us
up
more
than
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
suggested.
when
the
bill
was
first
submitted
in
1934,
it's
true
the
act
did
not
contain
a
conspiracy
clause.
however,
that
conspiracy
clause
was
put
in
as
the
act
was
going
through
congress
and
there's
no
question
where
it
came
from
because
at
that
time,
the
then
attorney
general
homer
cummings,
wrote
a
letter
in
which
he
submitted
a
new
brand
in
which
he
says
in
no
uncertain
terms,
we
have
had
it,
a
conspiracy
clause.
now,
the
government
suggested
that
this
must
be
read
in
context.
now,
what
do
we
mean
in
context
here?
at
the
time
the
attorney
general
suggested
this,
there
was
a
conspiracy
clause,
a
general
conspiracy
clause.
so
that,
you
didn't
have
to
have
the
addition
of
a
conspiracy
clause
in
the
hobbs
act,
in
order
to
convict
someone
of
conspiracy
because
that
was
already
on
the
books.
but
the
problem
was
that
in
1934,
they
were
concerned
about
increasing
the
punishment.
and
in
1934,
the
conspiracy
had
--
had
a
punishment
clause
of
two
years.
now,
we
suggest
that
the
attorney
general
when
he
said
that
he's
having
a
conspiracy
clause
meant
not
that
he
was
adding
something
that
he
couldn't
do
before,
because
he
could.
he
could
always
indict
somebody
for
conspiracy
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
don't
think
there's
much
difference
between
the
two,
although
there
is
an
overt
act
problem,
i
think
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
not
--
not
here.
although
--
although
the
petitioner
makes
some
mention
of
this.
i
don't
think
that
makes
a
different
support
in
the
question
of
crime,
because
i
think
they're
the
same
crime.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
but
i
know
of
no
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
would
agree.
i
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
right.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
exactly
the
same
result
would've
--
would've
turned
out
in
this
case.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
the
only
difference
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
and
the
only
difference
is
that
here,
we
have
a
--
a
number
of
other
violations
and
the
only
other
difference
is
overt
act
problem,
which
i
can
take
up
in
a
moment,
which
i
don't
think
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
there
was,
but
i
--
i
--
as
far
as
i
recall,
that
doesn't
help
on
this
problem.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
there
--
there
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
correct.
it
goes
a
little
further
than
the
--
the
copeland
committee
of
course,
held
these
hearings
in
new
york,
detroit
and
chicago
in
which
they
found
great
problems
of
racketeering.
all
of
these
bills
were
presented
at
one
time.
all
of
these
bills
have
the
backing
of
the
department
of
justice
because
they
were
concerned
about
all
of
these
problems
and
they
were
concerned
particularly
about
increasing
the
punishment
and
heaves
in
every
area
of
crime
that
they
could
go
after.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
may
--
i
may
not
have
that
particular
one.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no.
i
--
at
that
at
the
bottom
of
page
21
and
at
the
top
of
page
22,
we
just
quote
just
that
provision
of
the
letter.
we
don't
quote
the
whole
letter,
but
it
can
be
found
at
that
citation.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
do
you
mean,
how
--
how
does
the
fact
that
they
came
in
this
way
as
it
is?
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
it
aids
us
in
this
sentence.
i
think
we
must
recognize,
i
mean
if
we're
going
to
be
candid
about
it,
that
the
attorney
general
knew
at
the
time
he
submitted
this,
that
he
could
indict
someone
for
a
conspiracy
to
violate
this
act
without
adding
any
provision
here.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
that's
right.
we
therefore
say
that
in
view
of
the
purpose
of
increasing
the
punishments
in
this
statute
and
there
is
no
question
that
that's
all
the
way
through
because
they
have
the
sherman
act
and
they
say,
"well,
we
only
had
a
misdemeanor.
we
want
something
stronger
than
that."
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
started
out
with
1
to
99
years
in
it.
so
that
after
an
increase
in
punishment,
we
say
that
therefore,
it
is
consistent
to
say
that
the
attorney
general
suggested
the
conspiracy
clause
here
in
order
to
punish
a
conspiracy
in
this
statute
for
20
years,
not
two.
that
he
didn't
put
it
in
here
in
order
to
decrease
the
punishment
which
if
--
you
see,
if
all
on
that
--
if
he
could
indict
someone
under
the
act
for
20
years
for
conspiracy
and
that
was
the
end
of
it,
that
would
mean
that
the
attorney
general
meant
that
once
a
man
has
conspired,
he
can
get
20
years.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
happens
after
that.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
violence
is
used.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
extortion
actually
works
because
he
can't
get
anymore
punishment.
now
we
say
--
we
can't
see
that
the
attorney
general
would
say
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
i
think
--
i
agree.
i
think
the
consideration
that
he's
just
talking
about
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
--
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
these
are
two
different
approaches
to
two
different
problems.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
the
problem
of
which
i
--
i
--
as
i
understand
your
first
posing
is
the
question
of
whether
there
is
--
there
could
be
or
should
be
a
difference
in
punishment
between
somebody
who
combines
and
somebody
who
extorts.
now
i
say,
yes,
there
can
very
naturally
be
and
this
is
a
matter
which
the
trial
judge
must
consider
when
he
decides
how
much
punishment
the
man
should
have,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended
and
i
certainly
cannot
envision
the
attorney
general
recognizing
that
once
people
have
conspired
and
therefore
subject
to
20
years,
that
anything
they
do
after
that,
they
can't
get
anymore
punishment
for,
which
if
there's
only
a
20-year
punishment
here
for
conspiracy
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
a
man
conspires
and
has
violence
attached
to
it,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
a
man
extorts.
now,
i
don't
read
the
statute
that
way
and
i
don't
think
that
is
a
normal
way
that
the
attorney
general
would
read
the
statute.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
think
is
this
--
i
think
you've
known
--
i
think
you've
not
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
the
problem
is
this.
you
see
i
--
he
had
to
think
that
he
was
adding
some
punishment.
he
couldn't
think
--
let
me
make
it
clear,
he
could
not
think
that
all
he
was
doing
was
creating
a
crime
of
conspiracy.
he
had
to
be
adding
punishment
to
conspiracy.
the
reason
i
say
that
is,
supposed
the
bill
had
been
passed
without
the
conspiracy
and
with
the
99
years.
as
i
gather,
even
the
petitioner
would
recognize
that
he
could
be
indicted
for
conspiracy
under
the
general
statute
and
for
the
substantive
offense
under
the
hobbs
act
and
if
there
was
99
years,
there
would
be
99
years.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
judge
wouldn't
have
the
power
or
that
congress
hadn't
granted
the
judge
power
to
add
the
--
whatever
the
penalty
at
this
particular
time
is
for
general
conspiracy
clause
because
that
has
been
on
the
books
all
during
this
period,
and
as
i
gather,
petitioner
doesn't
--
doesn't
even
argue
that
he
couldn't
be
indicted
for
both
and
punished
for
both.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
don't
agree
that
they
said
either-or.
that's
the
only
part
of
that,
other
than
that,
i
agree
with
you
perfectly.
i
don't
think
you
can
get
any
--
i've
read
this
history
a
number
of
times.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
it
does
not
say
that
you
can
cumulate
punishment.
it
does
not
say
you
cannot
cumulate
punishment.
the
history
--
if
this
is
what
we
are
looking
for,
then
you
can
look
for
this
in
almost
all
the
criminal
statutes
because
this
is
not
a
problem
which
you
usually
find
discussed.
we
say
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
the
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
don't
think
they
had
to
in
order
to
gain
their
point.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
it
could
have
been.
and
the
reason
i
would
suggest
it
was
not,
is
because
they
were
not
concerned
in
terms
of
this
20
years.
if
you
look
at
--
this
is
not
the
1934
act.
now
this
is
--
they've
already
had
this
act
for
a
number
of
years.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
these
people
--
these
people
are
concerned
with
the
militant
labor
man.
they're
concerned
with
the
problem
posed
by
the
local
807
case.
they
are
concern
that
the
laboring
man
not
be
punished
and
for
this,
they
don't
have
to
go
20
years,
10
years
would
have
been
enough
to
make
the
argument,
they
were
concerned
to
point
out
that
there
was
a
difference
between
a
misdemeanor
and
the
sherman
act
and
a
felony
in
this
act
and
for
that
purpose,
they
didn't
have
to
say
any
number
of
years,
because
all
they
have
to
do
was
make
that
distinction
and
they
have
made
their
point.
that
was
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
this
discussion
was
directed
solely
to
the
question
that
the
congress
decided
they
did
not
like
the
interpretation
this
court
had
placed
on
the
act
in
the
local
807
case.
that
was
all
the
hobbs
act
had
to
do
except
for
one
thing
and
that
was,
they
increased
the
punishment
from
the
1934
act
which
was
10
years,
they
increased
it
to
20
years
and
that's
why
they
had
this
argument
of
20
years.
but
the
10-year
statute,
now
this
is
the
important
point
that
i
think
is
--
that
is
being
missed
by
looking
at
this
legislative
history,
the
10-year
act,
which
was
on
the
books
in
1934,
had
exactly
the
same
problem,
the
same
connotation,
the
same
situation
that
they
arrived
at
when
they
started
this
business
in
1942.
now,
they
didn't
talk
about
it
at
all
in
1934.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
didn't
reduce
it,
they
did,
they
reduced
it,
but
they
made
it
10
years.
now
the
problem
that
they
had
at
this
time
in
the
hobbs
act
was
that
they
had
increased
the
punishment
from
10
years
to
20
years.
it
wasn't
the
question
--
it's
true
they
could
have
said
40,
they
could
have
said
60,
but
they
could
have
said
this
in
1934,
you
see.
they
could
have
said
10,
20
or
30.
the
difference
was
not
in
that
relationship.
the
difference
was
between
10
years
in
the
1934
act
and
20
years
in
this
act.
and
that's
why
i
think
they
emphasized
20
years.
now,
i
agree,
you
can
read
this
anyway
you
wish.
i
think
candidly,
we
have
to
admit
that
no
one
saw
this
type
of
problem
insofar
as
saying
so
in
so
many
words.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
let
me
--
let
me
make
two
points
on
this.
number
one,
i
don't
think
we
have
arrived
with
the
problem
of
lenity
because
i
don't
think,
we
have
an
ambiguity.
because
if
you
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
an
ambiguity.
because
there's
a
real
gloss
on
this
statute
that
--
that
as
lawyers
recognized
it
and
as
it
had
been
interpreted
before
and
after
even
the
hobbs
act
was
passed,
in
all
the
cases
under
the
hobbs
act,
there'd
been
consistently
conspiracy
and
substantive
crimes
and
they've
been
punished.
but
important
for
congress,
if
congress
really
intended
to
do
what
petitioner
is
saying,
if
they
had
intended
that,
i
think
it
would
have
been
natural
for
congress
to
have
said
so
explicitly,
because
then
congress
is
making
a
change
from
the
customary
pattern
and
there's
a
prototype
to
these
two.
wisconsin
has
done
this
and
we
cite
this
in
our
brief.
they
have
a
statute
which
says
that
you
cannot
be
punished
for
both
conspiracy
and
substance.
i
think
this
is
--
if
they
thought
of
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
of
course
you
do
presuppose
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well
i
think
the
fact
to
have
advertent
to
it,
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
well,
if
i
did,
i
want
to
change
this
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
think
congress
did
not
advert
to
it.
that
does
not
mean
that
i
say
that
congress
intended
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
congress,
if
they
intended
to
talk
about
this
problem,
would
have
talked
about
it
in
terms
that
were
then
natural
for
lawyers
for
the
circuit
--
for
the
attorney
general
and
he
would
have
considered
them
as
separate.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
know.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
know.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
i
--
i
won't
agree
with
this
problem.
i
--
i
think
the
word
of
--
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
no,
i
recognize
that.
mr.
theodore
george
gilinsky
--
may
i
say
a
word
on
the
lenity
problem
before
closing.
as
i
say,
we
--
we
think
the
problem
could
have
been
answered
if
congress
had
intended
to
do
this.
they
could
have
said
so
and
that
would
have
been
the
natural
thing
for
them
to
do
in
--
in
view
of
the
long
history
this,
was
to
say,
not
--
you
cannot
punish
for
both.
we
think
that
would
have
been
the
more
natural
approach.
we
do
not
believe
there's
a
basis
for
lenity
in
this
case.
the
history
shows
that
an
increase
in
severity
all
the
way
through,
so
that
those
cases
which
deal
with
lenity
are
not
applicable.
such
cases
that
have
been
cited
are
the
universal
c.i.t.,
this
is
one
act
but
even
in
universal
c.i.t.,
this
court
recognized
three
offenses
as
separate
sections
of
that
act.
this
is
not
like
bell
whether
--
which
was
the
(inaudible)
case,
because
here,
there
is
a
controlling
gloss
on
the
statute.
this
is
not
like
heflin
or
ladner,
after
all
which,
we
have
to
remember
in
both
heflin
and
ladner,
there
were
conspiracies
that
were
separate
and
no
one
even
bothered
to
raise
that
problem
or
urge
it
when
it
came
to
this
court.
this
is
not
a
question
of
what
congress
could
have
done
if
they
had
thought
about
the
problem
because
we
feel
it's
the
other
way
that
if
they
had
said,
they
didn't
want
this,
which
would
have
reversed
the
entire
trend,
that's
what
they
should
have
said.
in
other
words
if
congress
was
going
to
say
anything,
they
have
to
say
it
the
other
way
rather
than
say,
“we
want
to
have
cumulative
punishment
because
all
the
statutes
always
have
cumulative
punishments.”
in
other
words,
we
think
there's
a
particular
force
in
this
statute
that
extortion
can
be
committed
alone
and
that's
the
crime.
that
a
conspiracy
can
be
committed
without
the
extortion,
that
there
are
separate,
they
have
ingredients
that
are
separate
and
they've
always
been
so
considered.
and
they've
been
transposed
back
and
forth,
in
and
out
of
statutes.
when
we
revised
the
code
in
--
in
1948,
they
took
out
conspiracies
from
a
lot
of
statute,
but
they
didn't
feel
that
there
was
any
change
in
punishment
and
they
said
there
wasn't.
so
they
treat
these
conspiracy
clauses
all
the
same,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they're
in
371
which
is
the
present
section
or
whether
they're
in
some
particular
--
except
for
two
things
punishment
or
if
it's
the
only
crime
that's
involved.
for
these
reasons,
we
feel
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed.
