how
does
that
illustrate
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
does,
what
you
just
read,
illustrate
it?
how
does
that
help
you
to
decide?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
thing
the
last
thing
that
you
read?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
light
has
that
shed
on
our
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
what
indication
abide
that
he
was
talking
about
a
particular
violation
under
the
statute
or
a
comprehensive
omnibus
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
knows
how
--
how
casually
and
unspecifically
congressmen
talk
when
they
want
to,
not
only
congressmen,
but
the
rest
of
us
talk.
and
that's
how
--
introduce
the
record,
the
specific
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
persist
in
saying
they
and
i
was
addressing
myself
to
a
specific
quotation
which
you
submitted
as
argumentative
consideration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
i
find
no
light
in
that,
whatever,
on
your
problem,
on
my
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
that
(voice
overlap)
to
the
other
things.
alright,
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
there
any
authorized
spokesman,
who
addressed
himself
specifically
to
the
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
give
me
one
that
is
all
grouped
--
all
the
general
talk
to
which
i
could
get
practically
known.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
one
good
argument
is
better
than
six
neutral
ones.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
page
--
what
page
is
that
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
does
it
exactly
mean?
what
was
mr.
fish's
objection?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
one
particular
offense,
he
didn't
say
it
all
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
say
that.
he
says,
"was
threatening
extortion."
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
at
least
he
gave
a
specific
--
he
addressed
himself
to
a
punishment,
a
maximum
punishment
for
one
of
the
designated
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know,
but
what
he
says,
is
a
man
maybe
sent
to
jail
for
20
years,
merely
for
threatening
extortion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
was
one
of
the
contained
offenses
under
the
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
didn't
say,
he
could
get
20
years
for
committing
--
for
violating
the
act
as
such,
he
picked
out
one
specific
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
that
sentence
shows
that
he
meant
to
cover
the
whole?
all
the
violations
that
are
committable
under
this
field
are
subject
only
to
one
punishment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
sentence
means
to
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nor
was
there
an
opposite
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
nor
was
there
a
specific
statement
to
the
contrary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
may
argue
that
that's
what
it
means.
all
i'm
saying
there,
is
no
statement
in
any
of
the
things
that
you
put
before
us
in
which
any
congressman
said,
there
can
be
only
one
punishment
for
all
the
violations
that
are
prescribed
in
that
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
you
printed
a
copy
of
the
new
york
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
printed
in
one
of
these
briefs?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
shenker?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
case
either
in
this
court
or
in
the
lower
courts,
in
which
a
man
joined
others
in
the
conspiracy
to
violate
the
sherman
law,
but
on
his
own
also,
entered
into
a
contract
which
was
executed
of
--
a
contract
for
price
fixing
which
held
that
he
couldn't
be
punished
both
for
joining
in
the
conspiracy
and
for
a
price
fixing
contract.
is
there
any
question
--
decision?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
we
have
such
a
case
that
--
that
might
shed
--
that
would
be
a
good
footnote
or
proof
of
what
congressman
celler
said.
but
until
you
have
such
a
case,
it
helps
me
very
little
to
--
to
apply
his
argument
that
it
shouldn't
be
severe
against
labor
than
it
should
be
against
combination
of
--
of
industries.
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
just
tells
--
just
as
little
in
one
session
as
in
another
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
no
more,
no
--
no
less.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
would
ask
me
to
consider
what
mr.
celler
said.
so
i'm
considering
it
and
he
analogizes
this
statute
to
the
sherman
law
and
i'm
putting
it
to
use
that
under
the
sherman
law,
there
could
be
probably
--
at
least
we
--
there's
no
reason
to
think
otherwise,
they
could
be
double
punishment,
both
the
conspiracy
and
the
substantive
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
though
i'm
just
--
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
the
material
you
put
before
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
that's
for
him,
that
point
is
valid
and
he's
made
it,
but
that
doesn't
leave
me
to
jump
over
that
you
can
have
only
one
punishment
for
labor,
although
you
have
two
punishments
and
offer
for
violation
of
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
that
you're
making
the
kind
of
an
argument
you
ought
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
making
the
kind
of
an
argument
that
i
think
you
ought
to
make.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
have
to
accept
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
--
that
is
you
don't
draw
different
inferences
from
the
same
material
but
you
--
but
you
subject
them
--
but
you
relate
them
different
considerations.
justice
felix
frankfurter
both,
which
proves
that
it's
in
another
great
tribute
to
the
ambiguity
of
language,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
will
the
more
--
a
more
particular
--
he
makes
a
more
ad
hoc
argument,
not
that
--
that
generally
speaking,
nothing
is
said
in
the
legislative
history
about
cumulative
sentences,
but
if
their
briefs
throughout
they
talk
of
congressmen
has
suggested
that
only
one
sentence
should
be
imposed,
you
do
not
have
to
be
specific
in
saying
that.
there's
still
a
way
around,
mr.
gilinsky.
justice
felix
frankfurter
out
of
what
committee
did
the
hobbs
bill
come?
is
it
the
judiciary
or
commerce?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
committee
out
of
which
penal
legislations
normally
come?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
isn't
quite
so,
is
this
because
there
would
be
a
function
for
an
outlawry
of
--
of
violence
--
acts
of
violence
in
this
field
and
the
spirit
has
two
a
--
has
two
a
very
different
things
without
as
a
matter
of
reason
or
policy,
not
concluding
that
if
both
are
committed,
you
should
give
only
one
punishment.
i
don't
see
why
you
say
that
if
he
under
that,
all
these
various
offences
enumerated
by
congress.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
it
part
and
parcel
to
conspiracy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
conspiracy
maybe
concluded
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
they've
just
agreed
to
come
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
that's
fine,
i
don't
understand
unless
i
misunderstood
your
suggestion
that
unless
you
allow
separate
punishments,
there'd
be
no
point
in
outlawing
separate
offenses.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
could
have
said
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
(inaudible)
could
make
all
arguments
that
are
convincing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
gilinsky
as
to
the
question
put
by
justice
harlan,
rationally,
as
an
abstract
consideration,
there
is
no
difficulty
in
force
of
having
congress
when
it
make
offenses
in
relation
within
a
given
territory
of
outlawed
conduct
that
all
offenses
within
that
area
of
criminal
or
penal
decision
that
it
makes
--
that
it
says
that
all
--
all
offenses
within
a
particular
penal
area,
shall
upon
the
punishment,
upon
the
guilt
of
one
or
all,
be
subject
to
a
single
defined
punishment.
there's
nothing
--
there's
nothing
in
a
way
of
reason
or
penology
that
it's
now,
why
they
shouldn't
do
that,
but
we're
dealing
with
situation
where
there's
--
where
there
is
a
purpose
in
the
consideration,
ambiguity,
the
language
of
allows
one
construction
rather
another
in
the
imposition
of
multiple
sentences
and
i
should
think
that
where
you
--
that
abstractly
considered
where
you
have
--
as
justice
harlan's
question
indicated
i
think,
conspiracy
and
a
substantive
offence
as
against
substantive
offenses
in
the
reference
to
a
particular
situation,
conspiracy
and
substantive
offense
present
different
considerations
than
fragmentized
substantive
offenses
within
the
same
area.
because
when
you
deal
with
conspiracy,
you
add
the
very
important
consideration
of
--
of
danger
or
menace
to
the
society
from
combined
action,
which
is
a
very
different
thing
from
the
commission
of
a
substantive
offense
by
one
or
more
people
because
that
is
the
great
thing
about
conspiracy
that
it's
directed
against
the
mischief
conceived
by
penalizing
such
combination
because
of
combination
and
not
because
of
the
substantive
offense.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
you
indicated
earlier,
the
distinction
is,
i
think
illustrated
by
the
difference
between
the
--
that
requisite
constituents
of
a
prosecution
of
this
combination
for
a
conspiracy
in
that
point
attempt.
you
can
punish
at
them
a
combination,
a
conspiracy
although
it
doesn't
reach
that
stage
of
seriousness
which
is
required
in
order
to
make
out
a
case
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow.
the
federal
conspiracy
statute,
conspiracy
to
defraud
or
conspiracy
to
violate
a
statute
does
have
to
have
overt
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
this
doesn't.
justice
felix
frankfurter
none
of
that
--
but
i
should
think
--
i
should
think
if
you
have
a
specific
conspiracy
statute,
you
said
they
couldn't
duplicate?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
certainly
couldn't
duplicate
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
way
you
have
a
specific
conspiracy
statute
as
part
of
a
substantively
out
--
substantively
outlawed
conduct.
would
you
think
that's
the
clearest
indication
you
can
have
but
that
is
meant
to
be
the
conspiracy
for
which
you
can
prosecute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
refuse
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
find
in
your
index
a
reference
to
attorney
general
cummings'
letter
or
also
certainly
aren't
on
this.
i
have
the
recollection
that
attorney
general
cummings,
all
the
conference
of
the
state
attorney
general
and
also
this
would
obtain,
in
far
to
be
with
this
problem,
am
i
right
about
that?
there
was
a
--
there
to
put
out
of
the
proceedings
of
that
conference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
i
mean
even
there
dealing
with
the
general
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
general
(inaudible)
to
tighten
the
law
will
increase
the
outlawed
conduct
and
to
stipulate
sentence
is
because
of
reverence
of
violence
and
combination
of
violence
throughout
the
country
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
hearing
that
i'm
referring
to
is
the
hearing
that
was
held
in
the
department
of
justice
under
the
sponsorship,
under
the
call
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
where
is
--
where
can
i
find
the
attorney
general's
letter
asking
for
a
special
conspiracy
statute?
never
mind,
i'll
dig
out
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
haven't
a
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
could
--
you
could
say
that
--
you
could
say
safely
say
i
think
--
you
could
safely
say
that
in
no
discussion
of
penal
legislation
where
they
have
an
outlaw
in
both
the
conspiracy
on
the
substantive
offense,
that
congress
explicitly
deal
with
the
problem
of
a
two
punishments
and
for
the
reason
that
you
have
given
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
are
such
separate
things
that
it
wasn't
appropriately
discussed
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
think
in
that
connection,
i
--
i
think
you've
discussed
the
conspiracy
thing
if
i
may
say
so
rather
obstructively,
they
are
confusing.
as
i
understand
the
situation
is
this,
when
the
attorney
general
cummings
intervened
that
there
was
this,
from
my
point
of
view,
outrageous
99
years
penalty
provisions,
but
merely
for
substantive
offenses.
and
as
you
say,
conspiracy
could
have
been
pursued
under
the
old
5440,
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
which
has
a
sentence
of
two
years.
but
barring
that,
there
was
nothing
to
deal
with
the
combination
of
this
racketeering
in
case
some
members
withdrew
from
the
combination.
they
couldn't
be
even
be
punished
for
attempt
because
very
often,
an
agreement
to
--
to
pull
a
job
somewhere
wouldn't
go
near
enough
to
constitute
attempt.
so
that
there
was
nothing
to
deal
with
people
who
did
go
far
enough
to
constitute
a
conspiracy,
but
some
of
them
had
a
change
of
heart
and
withdrew.
and
therefore,
a
conspiracy
addition
took
care
of
the
people
who
had
gone
far
enough
to
enable
the
prosecution
to
establish
a
--
a
conspiracy,
but
some
of
whom
had
withdrawn
and
therefore,
you
would
deal
in
the
same
way
with
people,
where
a
change
of
heart
and
thought
better
of
it
and
the
people
who
went
ahead
and
executed
with
violence,
that
which
was
so
severely
condemned
by
chief
justice
stone
in
his
dissent
in
287
which
led
the
think
to
the
severity.
that's
the
history
of
this
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
think
we're
bound
by
the
answers
of
argument
on
the
part
of
congressmen
on
either
side.
