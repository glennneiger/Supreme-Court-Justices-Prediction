mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
your
honors.
the
question
in
this
case
is
primarily
whether
the
court
and
--
and
the
racketeering,
the
so-called
racketeering
in
this
action
of
statute
whether
the
court
would
impose
consecutive
sentences
for
the
offense
of
conspiracy
as
well
as
for
the
substantive
offense.
the
custody
of
this
case
is
briefly
--
briefly
stated
as
follows.
in
1953,
actually
this
indictment
was
in
1954,
the
defendant
and
four
other
individuals
were
indicted
and
were
accused
for
violating
section
1951
of
18
u.s.c.,
that
is
the
so-called
racketeering
statute
or
the
hobbs
action.
the
defend
--
the
indictment
was
in
two
counts.
one
count,
alleged
at
conspiracy
and
the
other
count
alleged
in
the
violation
of
a
substantive
offense.
the
defendant
as
well
as
the
other
defendants
were
convicted
of
both
--
on
both
counts
in
the
indictment
and
the
court
sentenced
the
defendant
on
the
first
count
to
12
years
in
the
penitentiary
which
was
the
first
count
was
the
conspiracy
count
and
that
it
sentenced
the
defendant
from
the
second
count
also
for
12
years
to
serve
in
the
penitentiary.
and
--
but
the
court
suspended
the
survey
with
the
second
sentence
for
12
years
for
a
period
--
first
court
ordered
that
it
should
be
served
consecutively
but
suspended
the
serving
of
the
second
sentence
--
sentence
and
placed
the
defendant
on
probation
for
a
period
of
five
years,
the
period
of
probation
to
begin
at
the
time
the
--
he
had
released
and
completed
the
first
sentence
of
12
years.
the
defendant
began
to
serve
the
sentence
and
was
paroled
in
april
of
1960
on
the
first
sentence.
three
years
(inaudible)
proceeding
in
1900
--
in
december
of
1958
while
the
defendant
was
still
confined
on
the
rule
35
asking
the
court
originally
to
modify
the
original
sentence,
the
sentence
for
the
conspiracy
or
on
the
alternative
to
grant
us
relief,
it
being
our
contention
that
that
statute
provides
for
a
total
punishment
of
20
years
and
that
is
the
maximum
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
and
that
can
be
imposed
by
the
court,
and
that
that
is
not
possible
under
that
statute
to
give
consecutive
sentences.
insofar
as
the
--
and
that
is
to
give
consecutive
sentences
for
the
violation
of
the
various
provisions
of
that
statute.
in
order
--
and
at
the
outset,
let
--
let
us
say
this
because
this
pertinent
there
seems
to
be
a
considerable
portion
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
spent
on
the
idea
that
--
that
congress
confessed
legislation
permitting
the
imposition
of
consecutive
sentences
insofar
as
--
as
the
--
as
substantive
charges
well
as
the
--
as
the
conspiracy.
we
are
not
contending
at
all
that
congress
does
not
have
that
power.
we
admit
that
congress
has
the
power
and
the
authority
to
proscribe
punishments
that
can
be
assessed
for
conspiracies
as
well
as
for
the
supplemental
offense
and
that
both
punishments
can
be
imposed
consecutively.
the
point
that
we
are
raising
and
that
we
are
contending
is
that
this
action,
that
the
history
of
this
action
is
of
such
a
nature
that
that
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
at
any
time
that
punishment
shall
exceed
at
any
time,
shall
exceed
the
total
sum
of
20
years.
that
would
be
no
additional
or
consecutive
sentences
imposed.
now
the
history
of
this
section
and
the
--
in
order
to
get
to
really
arrive
at
the
intent
of
congress,
it
is
necessary
to
examine
the
legislative
history
and
--
and
see
just
how
the
beginning
of
this
particular
law.
in
1933,
legislative
hearings
were
began
in
new
york,
in
other
cities
for
the
purpose
of
coping
with
the
situation,
at
least
that
is
what
the
newspapers
claim,
coping
with
the
situation,
dealing
with
organized
racketeering.
and
various
hearings
were
held
by
congress
and
as
a
result,
in
1933,
92
bills
were
introduced
in
congress,
all
allegedly
and
pertaining
to
this
question
of
dealing
with
racketeering
in
interstate
commerce.
out
of
those
92
bills,
11
bills
were
ultimately
passed.
the
so-called
racketeering
statute,
the
statute
which
is
the
ultimately
resulted
and
the
statute
of
which
we
are
concerned
now
was
one
of
those.
originally
the
first
version
that
was
introduced
in
congress
was
in
the
senate,
but
that
was
introduced,
provided
for
a
fine
equal
to
the
amount
of
money
that
was
or
the
gain
that
was
realized
by
the
defendant
and
also
provided
for
punishment
up
to
99
years.
that
statute
had
no
provision,
no
--
no
conspiracy
provision
at
all.
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
that
is
the
letter
that
was
submitted
by
the
attorney
general
and
was
signed
mr.
homer
cummings,
who
was
the
attorney
general
at
that
time
that
was
signed
by
mr.
reis
who
was
the
assistant
attorney
general
and
mr.
reis
at
that
time
provided,
stated
and
that
is
to
be
--
to
be
found
on
the
--
in
the
petitioner's
brief
page
17
and
it
calls
that
the
--
in
the
latter
of
(inaudible)
refers
to
it
as
the
draft
of
the
proposed
federal
racketeering
statute,
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
says
that
this
act
was
designed
primarily
to
prevent
and
punish
capitalistic
combinations
of
monopolies
and
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
--
that
the
statute
that
since
--
that
the
sherman
act
was
(inaudible)
that
it
only
provides
for
a
year
punishment
for
a
year
in
jail
and
a
$5000
fine,
and
then
it
con
--
it
--
the
states
with
reference
to
this
so-called
presently
known
object
he
says
that
the
accompanied
proposed
statute
is
designed
to
avoid
many
of
the
embarrassing
limitations
and
the
wording
and
interpretations
of
the
sherman
act.
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
--
that
offenses
of
this
character
are
designed
to
be
prohibited
and
that
there
are
such
a
serious
nature
that
they
ought
to
be
--
that
it
provides
for
the
punishment
of
--
of
a
fine
and
also
of
not
less
than
one
year
for
a
long
--
the
courts
shall
in
its
discretion
shall
determine.
and
then
the
fine
shall
be
commensurate,
it
shall
be
at
least
commensurate
with
the
amount
of
the
unlawful
gain.
now
there
was
considerable
discussion.
there
was
a
considerable
discussion
pertaining
to
this
--
to
this
section.
and
it
--
and
the
punishment
that
it
provided
and
ultimately
it
resulted
in
the
passage
of
--
of
the
act
in
1934
which
was
--
which
was
finally
passed.
it
was
not
passed
in
1933
but
that
it
was
finally
--
finally
passed
in
1934
and
it
provided
at
that
time
a
punishment
of
up
to
10
years
in
the
penitentiary
and
a
fine
up
to
$10,000
and
that
became
the
law.
and
during
the
discussion,
the
only
--
there
wasn't
too
much
discussion
about
the
punishment
except
that
it
was
going
--
there
was
--
it
was
moved
that
the
punishment
should
be
10
years
and
that's
what
it
was.
now
that
remained
the
law
until
after
this
court
decided
the
local
8th
or
7th
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
and
i
believe
it
was
march
of
1942.
in
that
case,
the
court
felt
that
it
did
not
apply
--
the
court
affirmed
the
lower
court's
decision
holding
that
that
act
does
not
apply
to
labor
unions
and
so
far
as
their
dealings
with
employer
is
concerned
even
though
force
and
violence
may
have
been
used.
and
as
a
result
of
that,
various
hearings
of
the
statutes
began
in
the
legislature
and
the
various
--
an
attempt
was
made
to
amend
this
particular
law
so
as
to
include
labor
unions.
and
by
virtue
of
that,
they
knew
the
hobbs
act
was
passed.
the
hobbs
act
is
substantially
in
the
same
form.
it
was
substantially
in
the
same
form
finally
in
1946
in
which
it
is
today.
there
was
very
little
modification
made
during
the
revision,
that
was
made
for
title
18
in
1948.
now
the
discussion
was
heard
as
to
punishment
and
congressman
hobbs
stated
that
the
maximum
punishment,
he
stated
that
a
numerous
time
that
a
maximum
punishment
permitted
under
that
act
was
20
years
and
there
was
no
discussion
at
any
time
as
to
any
consecutive
sentences
to
the
contrary
every
time
--
every
time
there
was
--
he
was
questioned
pertaining
to
the
length
of
the
punishment
and
the
congressman
contending
that
the
punishment
was
too
great,
the
20
years
was
too
great,
he
stated
that
he
was
(inaudible)
it
after
the
act
--
after
the
new
york
racketeering
statute
and
that
the
new
york
racketeering
statute
provided
for
a
maximum
punishment
of
30
years
and
that
he
took
the
averages
from
various
courts
of
the
country
and
that
--
and
that
he
thought
that
20
years
was
not
an
unreasonable
amount
since
it
dealt
with
robbery
and
extortions.
it
is
significant
to
note
that
at
that
time,
the
--
the
conspiracy
statute
in
new
york
at
the
time
when
--
when
congressman
hobbs
stated
that
the
20
years
was
the
maximum
and
that
it
is
reasonable
in
view
of
the
other
statutes,
that
the
new
york
statute
had
no
conspiracy
provision
in
it
and
that
new
york
at
that
time,
the
only
conspiracy
that
prevails
with
a
general
--
general
conspiracy
which
provided
only,
it
was
--
which
was
a
misdemeanor
and
the
maximum
punishment,
i
believe
is
one
year
in
jail
for
that.
now
when
that
is
taken
into
consideration
and
all
the
legislative
custody
shows
that
there
was
only
the
question
that
the
only
punishment
that
was
talked
about
was
20
years.
and
at
that
very
time,
during
the
time
the
act
was
being
considered,
there
was
also
--
there
was
also
--
that
is
between
1942
and
1946
that
it
was
finally
passed,
there
was
also
considered
an
act
of
interfering
with
interstate
commerce
at
war
time
and
there
was
a
special
a
separate
section
and
a
separate
bill
for
that
but
a
separate
section
but
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
part
of
the
same
act.
and
in
considering
that,
the
only
point
that
was
considered
then
was
also
20
years,
and
there
was
no
conspiracy
section
in
the
war,
in
the
interference
with
interstate
commerce
during
the
war.
and
certainly,
it
would
appear
that
they
would
--
congress
would
not
have
intended
and
would
not
intend
to
make
it
a
greater
--
to
--
to
have
a
greater
punishment
and
to
make
it
a
greater
offense
to
it
appears
with
interstate
commerce
in
any
amount
or
whatsoever
at
peace
time
than
it
would
at
war
time.
and
--
and
the
only
penalty
as
i've
indicated
was
during
the
war
time
was
supposed
to
be
20
years
and
no
conspiracy
sanction
was
involved
there.
it
is
also
significant
to
note
that
with
congress,
when
congress
devised
and
codified
all
of
the
laws
under
the
title
18
and
1948,
that
there
they
took
the
general
conspiracy
that
there
under
the
general
conspiracy
statute,
that
they
pointed
out
that
certain
special
conspiracy
statutes
remained,
because
they
--
they
had
special
application
and
they
concerned
themselves
with
greater
punishment.
that
there
was
no
savings
clause,
in
other
words,
there
is
no
mentioned
of
this
--
of
the
conspiracy
in
the
hobbs
act
indicating
definitely
certainly
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
this
conspiracy
statute
shall
be
treated
separate,
distinct
and
apart
as
being
effective
insofar
as
punishment
is
concerned
but
treating
it
at
all
times
as
a
part
of
the
entire
statute
and
relating
purely
to
the
basic
and
to
the
basic
and
to
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
at
the
conclusion
yesterday,
i
called
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
reviser
of
the
1948
code,
when
that
was
--
and
it's
embodied
in
h.r.
bill
3190
and
was
reported
to
judiciary
committee
which
--
which
accompanied
that
bill
and
that
at
that
time
and
the
--
and
that
so
far
as
conspiracies
are
concerned
and
if
i
may
just
read
that
long
paragraph
wherein
the
report
states
that
a
number
of
special
conspiracy
provisions
relating
to
specific
offenses
which
were
contained
in
various
sections
incorporated
in
this
title
were
omitted,
because
adequately
covered
by
this
section.
a
few
exceptions
were
made.
one,
where
conspiracy
would
constitute
the
only
offense
and
two
or
where
the
punishment
provided
in
this
action
would
not
be
commensurate
with
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
special
conspiracy
provisions
were
retained
in
sections
and
then
it
gives
a
number
of
sections
and
then
it's
the
--
of
this
title
and
then
it
says,
conspiracy
provisions
were
added
to
certain
sections.
now,
in
each
instance,
it
omits
any
reference
to
it
that
conspiracy
to
this
section
that
is
to
--
to
1951.
we
--
we
state
that
the
mere
--
that
even
that
fact,
there's
an
indication
that
there
was
no
intent
at
any
time
by
the
congressional
committee
or
by
congress
in
passing
that
law
to
consider
the
conspiracy
provision
of
this
act,
as
relayed
into
punishment
any
different
than
the
act
itself.
and
that
all
it
considered
was
that
it
considered
the
entire
act
that
racketeering
section
was
considered
all
and
--
all
as
a
force
of
one
act.
and
that
the
only
reason
that
the
various
methods
of
violating
the
law
were
--
were
prescribed
was
in
--
in
order
to
make
sure
that
if
a
violation
occurs,
that
a
person
could
be
considered
as
being
guilty
of
a
violation
of
law
and
could
be
punished.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
the
--
that's
at
page
41
in
the
middle
of
the
--
bottom
of
that
page.
now
it
is
--
of
course,
on
situations
of
this
nature,
not
considering
the
question
even
whether
you
could
--
you
can
or
it
cannot
have
consecutive
punishments
for
a
conspiracy,
as
well
as
for
the
violation
of
the
--
for
a
substantive
violation.
of
course,
the
legislative
history
is
--
is
very
pertinent
because
after
all
that
is
the
--
the
part
that
--
that
was
--
would
--
would
govern
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
intent
of
congress
and
the
discussion,
all
of
the
discussions
in
the
legislative
history,
i'm
again
referring
to
it,
relates
only
to
this
question
of
20
years.
i
should
like
to,
if
i
may,
call
attention
to
the
--
some
of
the
discussion
that
was
had
in
the
--
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
and
referring
to
--
to
page
12
on
top
of
the
page
which
is
from
the
1889
congressional
record,
where
--
where
mr.
delaney
has
said,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
this
committee
report
was
not
unanimous.
also
in
the
committee
it
was
indicated
by
those
in
favor
of
this
legislation,
that
a
legislation
is
too
drastic
that
the
$10,000
fine
and
20
years
in
jail
is
too
drastic.
they
think
a
modified
--
they
think
a
modified
bill
might
be
more
in
consonance
with
present
day
thinking.
and
then
mr.
fish
continued
on
the
same
page
and
states,
"i
want
to
refer
likewise
to
some
of
the
excessive
penalties.
the
penalties
in
this
bill
in
my
opinion
were
too
severe,
20
years,
and
$10,000
fine."
when
we
reach
this
section
of
the
bill,
there
should
be
very
careful
consideration
given
to
reducing
both
the
extent
of
the
imprisonment
and
the
fines.
a
reading
--
and
referring
again
to
congressman
celler
and
also
on
the
same
page
on
the
--
on
the
appendix,
at
the
bottom
of
page
12,
mr.
celler
says,
"let
me
call
your
attention
to
one
or
two
items
in
the
bill
which
meet
with
my
disfavor.
for
example,
the
bill
provides
for
a
punishment
of
20
years
and/or
a
fine
of
$10,000."
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"examine
the
antitrust
statutes
and
you
will
find
that
malefactors
under
those
statutes
do
not
have
to
face
a
20-year
sentence."
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
equally
detrimental
to
the
body
politic
and
or
as
much
as
crime
as
extortion
or
robbery
as
contemplated
by
the
instant
bill.
now
i'm
citing
this
not
only
to
show
there
was
only
20
years
but
it
also
shows
that
in
each
instance,
everyone,
everyone
of
the
congressmen
and
the
committee
rules
and
the
discussion
of
the
floors
in
each
instance,
they
were
treating
this
as
a
package.
they
were
treating
this
as
--
as
something
that
is
--
that
is
to
reach
out
to
get
group
activity,
that
there
wasn't
a
law
that
was
passed
for
an
individual,
that
it
was
--
rather
it
was
a
law
that
was
passed
to
reach
out
to
racketeering,
to
group
activity
rather
than
into
individuals.
then
congressman
celler
goes
on,
"if
the
extortion
or
robbery
is
of
such
magnitude
that
it
ought
to
be
prosecuted
as
a
felony
instead
of
a
misdemeanor,
then
the
prosecution
should
be
under
state
law,
it
goes
on
to
say.
in
so
far
as
the
instant
bill
is
concerned,
it
does
not
intend
to
punish
extortion
or
robbery,
as
such
since
that
would
be
a
--
usurpation
of
state's
functions.
it
intends
to
punish
activities
which
interfere
with
interstate
commerce.
in
that
respect,
it
parallels
the
antitrust
laws.
punishment
for
violations
of
which
are
likewise
based
on
interference
with
interstate
commerce,
but
in
the
one
case
where
capital
is
involved,
you
have
the
penalty
of
one
year
and
the
r.a.
case
where
labor
is
involved,
you
have
the
penalty
of
20
years.
now,
there
is
--
that
shows
all
the
thinking.
then
we
go
on
in
there
where
mr.
springer
in
discussion,
congressman
springer
says,
"may
i
ask
my
distinguished
colleague
on
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
if
it
is
not
a
fact
that
under
the
provisions
of
this
bill
the
question
of
penalty
is
left
entirely
discretionary
with
the
court
trying
the
case?"
under
the
provisions
of
this
bill,
a
person
could
be
penalized
to
the
extent
of
1
year
or
less
than
1
year
or
up
to
20
years.
all
in
the
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
oh,
i'm
sorry,
page
13
of
the
appendix.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes
your
honor,
page
13
of
the
appendix.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
and
--
and
then,
going
on,
this
question,
mr.
springer
was
addressed
to
congressman
celler
on
the
committee
and
continued
on
the
same
page.
mr.
celler
goes
on,
"or
his
sentence
might
be
suspended.
i
agree
with
the
gentleman,
but
why
do
we
single
out
labor
and
impose
even
a
possible
penalty
of
20
years?"
psychologically,
that
is
a
point.
to
my
way
of
thinking
especially
since
innocent
labor
acts,
lawful
acts
might
be
inter
--
indicted
especially
if
my
amendment
shall
not
prevail,
that
will
be
ceased
upon
by
everyone
who
has
any
opposition
to
the
bill
and
will
be
exaggerated
a
lot
important.
then
--
then
they
go
on
and
--
and
just
quoting
a
portion
of
mr.
hancock's,
which
is
in
the
bottom
of
the
page,
to
illustrate
as
to
just
what
this
bill
was
attempt
--
what
were
they
attempted
to
reach
with
that
bill
and
mr.
hancock
says
about
the
sixth
line
after
the
beginning
of
the
paragraph
it
says,
"it
had
its
origin
in
the
activities
of
the
dillinger
gang.
all
this
bill
does
is
to
abolish
a
double
standard
which
justice
burns
established
and
makes
labor
responsible
for
crimes
just
as
well
as
those
who
are
not
laborers,
that
is
all
it
does."
again,
pointing
out
that
they're
talking
about
group
activity.
then
going
on
to
--
to
page
14
of
the
--
of
the
appendix,
into
the
bottom
paragraph,
it
says
in
there
that
mr.
celler
again,
"justice
burns
in
his
decision
stated
there
was
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
congress
to
interfere
with
the
traditional
activities
of
labor
unions.
we
put
into
copeland
act
a
specific
provision
which
favored
the
traditional
activities
of
labor
union.
therefore,
the
original
act
as
well
as
this
bill
is
aimed
at
labor.
it
seeks
to
do
a
way
with
the
excesses
or
the
racketeering
of
the
dillinger
type.
that
being
the
case,
should
not
we
have
been
more
careful
in
providing
penalties,
rather
than
put
a
20-year
penalty
in
this
bill,
again
showing
that
he
is
treating
it
as
a
group
situation
in
the
discussion
and
that
all
they're
talking
about
is
20
years.
there's
no
mention
that
any
time
made
of
any
consecutive
sentences
of
any
sentence
that
could
possibly
be
in
excess
of
20
years.
and
to
mr.
--
mr.
sadowski
goes
on,
on
page
15
of
the
appendix,
he
says,
mr.
sadowski,
"the
most
highly
publicized
anti-labor
bill
now
before
congress
is
the
hobbs
bill.
the
sponsors
of
this
bill
call
it
an
anti-racketeering
act.
we
all
agree
that
racketeering
should
be
ended
and
that
the
punishment
for
racketeering
should
be
severe.
however,
there
is
already
an
anti-racketeering
statute
on
federal
law,
which
is
called
the
anti-racketeering
act
of
1934."
and
then
he
goes
on,
"the
trouble
with
the
hobbs
bill
is
that
it
can
be
construed
by
the
courts
to
prohibit
and
punish
most
of
the
legitimate
activities
of
organized
labor.
on
that
its
provisions,
a
man
who
voted
for
a
strike
or
walked
the
picket
line
was
arrested
and
being
sentenced
to
a
maximum
of
20
years
in
prison
or
be
fined
$10,000
or
-
or
both.
whatever
the
proponents
of
the
proposed
measure
may
say,
the
language
of
the
hobbs
bill
is
so
broad
that
it
constitutes
a
serious
manner
to
all
that
organize
labor
has
struggled
for,
blood
for
and
even
die
it
for
through
many
decades."
again,
only
talking
about
the
20
years
and
the
$10,000
fine,
then
skipping
to
page
16
and
--
and
mr.
robinson
of
kentucky
states,
"there
are
some
objections
to
the
penalties
prescribed
in
this
bill
for
robbery
and
extortion.
it
has
gone
forth
to
the
country
that
the
penalty
is
20
years."
that
is
not
a
correct
statement
and
obviously
mr.
robinson
was
for
the
bill
and
he
says,
"that
is
not
a
correct
--
the
penalties
range
from
1
hour
and
up
to
20
years,
according
to
the
offense,
and
to
the
offense
and
fines
of
$1
to
$10,000."
in
other
words,
the
20
years
and
the
$10,000
fine
were
the
maximum.
the
court
can
fix
any
length
of
time
of
imprisonment
up
to
20
years
or
any
fine
up
to
$10,000
or
both.
now,
again,
it
illustrates
the
--
the
thinking
in
--
in
that
matter.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
it
helps
you
decide,
your
honor,
in
the
following
matter,
that
during
all
those
discussions
into
what
extensive
discussions
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
it
sheds
on
the
following
way,
that
--
that
he
says
that
the
most
that
can
be
imposed
is
20
years.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well
if
--
if
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
the
only
way
--
the
only
way
that
you
can
--
that
i
can
answer
that
is
that
if
you
read
the
entire
--
the
entire
congressional
history,
it
shows
that
they
were
talking
about
the
entire
bill.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
if
you
read
--
if
you
read
the
remainder
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
if
you
read
the
remainder
of
the
congressional
history
and
--
in
the
discussion
that
took
place
at
that
time,
you
will
see
that
--
that
all
the
discussion
by
this
congressman,
robinson,
as
well
as
the
other
members
of
the
legislative
committee
were
only
talking
about
the
entire
bill,
that
they
were
not
talking
about
the
various
sections
of
the
bill.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
may
call
on
mr.
hobbs,
congressman
hobbs,
who
is
the
one
that
was
the
sponsor
of
the
act
and
who
is
referred
to
as
the
--
and
the
act
is
referred
as
the
hobbs
act.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
i
agree
with
the
--
with
the
court.
now,
here's
what
congressman
hobbs
says
when
--
on
page
18
of
the
--
of
the
appendix
and
mr.
--
and
--
in
reply
to
a
--
to
a
statement
by
mr.
fish,
mr.
fish
stated
on
top
of
page
18,
"mr.
chairman,
i
offer
an
amendment
which
i
sent
to
the
clerk's
desk."
the
clerk
read
--
the
clerk
reads
as
follows.
"amendment
offered
by
mr.
fish,
page
--
fish
page
3,
line
13,
after
the
word,
"then,"
strikeout
20
and
insert,
"then."
mr.
fish
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
at
page
18
on
--
on
the
top
of
the
page.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
on
the
appendix.
and
--
and
mr.
fish
states,
"mr.
chairman,
i've
already
required
a
minute
to
speak
on
this
amendment.
when
the
bill
was
before
the
rules
committee,
it
seemed
to
me
at
that
time
that
these
penalties
were
excessive.
twenty
years
is
just
about
as
bad
as
a
life
sentence
and
i
want
to
give
the
house
the
opportunity
to
reduce
it
by
cutting
it
in
half.
this
applies
to
threat,
a
man
may
be
sent
to
jail
for
20
years
merely
for
threatening
extortion.
such
of
drastic
and
severe
penalty
takes
you
back
to
the
dark
ages
and
it's
not
warranted
or
aligned
with
the
offense."
now,
mr.
hobbs
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
mr.
fish
wanted
to
cut
the
penalty
from
20
years
to
10
years.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
of
the
act,
of
the
act
and
here's
what
mr.
hobbs
said.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
what
that's
--
that's
what
he
said.
oh,
well,
very
well,
he
--
he
said
at
least,
on
that
point.
no,
he
--
he
wanted
that
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
not.
the
amendment
was
to
the
entire
act
but
they
said,
at
least
10
years
for
that
warrant
in
his
statement,
but
the
amendment
was
to
the
entire
act.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
that's
right.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
he
used
that
as
an
illustration,
is
what
he
did.
he
used
that
as
an
illustration.
here's
what
congressman
hobbs
said
which
answers
--
which
answers
your
question
as
to
someone
--
one
person
making
the
statement,
"mr.
hobbs
--
mr.
chairman,
arise
in
our
position
to
the
amendment
offered
by
the
gentleman
from
new
york."
this
is
also
on
page
18,
"mr.
chairman,
the
--
the
punishment
fixed
in
this
bill
is
a
maximum.
the
punishment
fixed
in
this
bill
is
a
maximum
and
any
punishments
imposed
by
a
judge,
of
one
cent
or
one
hour
in
jail
would
be
covered
by
this
maximum
penalty
just
the
same."
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes,
sir.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
involve
--
with
certainly,
when
you
take
it
in
line
with
everything
else,
there
is
no
other
way
you
can
say
it.
he
has
never,
at
no
time,
was
there
any
suggestion
by
anyone
in
the
discussion
that
there
could
be
under
any
conceivable
theory,
an
imposition
of
--
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
greater
than
20
years
for
any
and
all
violations
under
that
act.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well
i
--
i
consider
that.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well
is
there
any
--
the
mere
fact
that
they
thought
that
the
most
that
they
can
inflict
is
a
20-year
punishment.
that
certainly
and
clearly
--
clearly
shows
that
and
where
--
where
mr.
hobbs
went
on
even
to
say
that,
"may
i
point
it
out
to
the
house."
that's
what
congressman
hobbs
said,
again,
that
this
bill
was
copied
substantially
from
the
new
york
statute,
which
punishes
first
degree
robbery
for
a
minimum
punishment
of
10
years
and
a
maximum
of
30
years.
we
took
the
average
of
20
years
as
the
maximum
but
no
minimum.
i
think
the
gentleman
is
amply
protected
and
his
desire
for
the
penalty
to
be
reasonable.
and
we're
--
doing
--
and
all
we
are
doing
is
giving
the
court
that
to
make
this
punishment
fit
the
crime
and
at
each
time,
only
talking
--
only
talking
about
20
years.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
do
--
do
we
have
a
copy
of
the
new
york
statute?
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
have
not.
we
shall
be
glad
to
furnish
it
to
the
court,
but
how
it
--
and
going
on
again
along
that
discussion,
we're
in
page
22
of
the
--
in
page
--
in
page
22
of
the
--
of
the
appendix
where
mr.
celler
says,
on
top
of
that
page,
"whether
you
place
penalties
in
these
--
on
these
legitimate
activities
of
labor
that
go
up
to
20
years
in
jail
and
up
to
$10,000,
if
you
look
at
the
antitrust
penalties
against
employers,
you'll
find
that
there
are
only
$5000
or
one
year
in
jail.
this
bill
has
direct
relation
to
the
antitrust
laws,
the
clayton
act,
examine
those
acts
and
see
what
you
do
to
the
manufacturers
and
organizations."
and
then
he
goes
on,
finally,
skipping
a
little,
you
inflict
the
penalty
of
only
$5000
but
on
the
laboring
men,
you
inflict
the
penalty
of
$10,000
or
in
the
alternative
20
years
in
jail.
if
--
if
that
is
not
a
portion
on
justifiable
penalty,
i
would
like
to
know
what
is.
again,
only
talking
about
the
20
years
and
it's
certainly
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
there
was
any
other
consideration,
here,
you
have
a
mandate
that
would
oppose
to
the
bill.
you
have
a
number
of
congressmen
that
would
oppose
to
the
bill.
and
if
they
could
have
construed
it
and
even
thought
that
the
bill
could
be
construed,
that
in
any
matter
at
all
as
inflicting
a
punishment
greater
than
20
years,
they
would
have
said,
now,
not
only
can
they
get
10
--
20
years
on
long
part
but
if
he's
also
guilty
of
conspiracy,
he
can
get
20
years
for
conspiracy
and
20
years
for
the
substantive
offense
which
would
have
made
it
40
years.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
yes.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
--
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
answer
this.
i
--
i
cannot
answer
that
question
directly,
but
have
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well
i
--
i
--
that
--
that
of
course
take
us
over
then
to
another
--
another
facet
of
the
discussion.
i'm
pointing
again
this
ad
--
idealized
that
view
of
here
on
a
limited
--
for
a
limited
purpose
and
that
is
the
question
whether
you
can
have
sentences
in
excess
of
20
years,
under
this
act.
and
--
and
it
appears
--
it
appears
that
with
all
these
discussions
and
there's
--
there's
--
this
is
not
a
discussion
that
only
goes
on
during
one
session
of
congress.
it
goes
on
into
(inaudible)
from
1933.
it
starts
in
1933
and
it
goes
on
to
1946.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
with
the
exception
--
with
the
exception
that
with
all
these
lawyers
that
were
on
the
judiciary
committee,
if
they
could
have
construed
it
in
any
manner
that
it
would
be
--
that
would
have
been
farther
than
his,
they
would
have
had
ammunition
against
the
proponents
of
the
bill.
they
are
proponents
that
one
as
--
as
--
that
one
substantial
punishment.
now,
here,
knowing
where
the
lawyers
are,
they're
looking
for
manners
of
attack
and
if
they
could
have
said
and
come
up
before
the
committee
and
said,
"look,
you're
not
only
asking
for
a
20-year
punishment,
you
are
asking
for
a
40-year
or
a
60
or
an
80
years,
because
that's
what
it
is."if
you
take
the
four
subsections,
you
could
conceivably
make
it
80
years.
they
would
have
certainly
used
that.
we
must
assume
that
those
lawyers
were
looking
for
ways
of
attacking
that
--
that
legislation
because
they
certainly,
that
there's
considerable
legislative
history,
but
at
no
time
--
at
no
time,
did
they
even
mention
that
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
which
would
mean
that
so
construed
it.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well
--
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
his
analogy
of
course
to
that
was
for
the
purpose
of
showing
the
distinction
between
labor
and
management.
this
contention
was
that
management,
if
they
do
the
same
thing,
they
--
they
put
--
the
statute
provides
for
a
--
for
a
fine
of
$5000
--
of
five
--
of
10
--
up
to
$5000
and
one
year
and
whereas
labor,
it
would
be
something
else.
that
was
an
analogy.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
but
what
--
do
you
think
that
i
am
unreasonable
in
arguing
that
with
all
those
lawyers
looking
for
excuses
to
attack
the
--
the
penalty
provision
of
this
bill,
that
at
no
time,
not
even
one
mention
that
--
that
could
be
a
possible
40
or
60
or
80
years?
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
let
me
--
i
--
i
--
i'm
very
happy
that
that
you
brought
it
up.
judge
weber
was
not
the
sentencing
judge?
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
judge
hulin
was
the
sentencing
judge
and
judge
hulin
died
about
2
and
a
--
well,
in
fact
judge
weber
took
judge
hulin's
place.
now,
judge
weber,
in
his
decision
which
--
which
we
are
submitting,
he
--
he
sort
of
--
was
uncertain
as
to
which
way
he
--
he
really
never
--
never
came
out
clearly
inside.
at
no
--
at
no
time
then
he
clearly
said
that
--
that
you
can
have
a
consecutive
sentence.
he
sort
of
went
off
on
the
sound
battle
on
the
theory
that
perhaps
the
--
the
question
as
to
whether
the
--
the
consecutive
sentence
is
proper
is
something
to
be
gotten
at
later
when
the
first
sentence
is
completed
and
of
course,
our
first
sentence
isn't
completed
as
yet,
because
the
defendant
is
out
on
parole
which
--
on
parole
and
he
wasn't
on
parole
at
the
time
he
first
--
the
matter
came
up
before
judge
weber.
and
--
and
judge
weber
sort
of
left
that
part
still
open.
it
--
it
hold
on
there
both
ways.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
well,
of
course,
the
sentence
was
imposed.
in
other
words,
when
judge
hulin
imposed
the
sentence,
he
imposed
12
and
--
12
years
and
12
years
and
suspended
the
second
12-year
sentence
on
--
and
put
the
defendant
on
probation.
that
period
of
probation
to
continue
after
the
first
sentence
has
been
complied
with,
which
means
in
this
instance,
this
--
the
amount
of
--
of
time
that
he
served
plus
the
--
the
period
of
--
of
full
--
that
--
the
defendant
is
out
on
parole.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
certainly.
mr.
morris
a.
shenker
we
did
and
we
did
this
before
judge
weber.
we
asked
that
he
revise
the
first
sentence
rather
the
second
sentence.
in
other
words,
are
not
--
although
we
asked
on
a
--
we
asked
on
behalf
--
specifically,
we
asked
judge
weber
originally
in
our
petition
that
he
reduced
the
sentence.
in
other
words
to
treat
it
--
to
treat
as
a
general
sentence
if
he
wanted
to
and
--
and
make
it
20
and
to
reduce
the
first
sentence
by
four
years.
that
was
the
original
but
we
also
asked
--
but
we
also
asked
him
to
change
the
sentence
to
comply
with
the
--
without
interpretation
of
the
law.
and
judge
weber
wrote
that
out
of
lengthy
opinion
on
it,
wherein
he
finally
winds
up
and
says
that,
"well,
that
other
question
may
be
premature."
on
the
question
of
20
years
that
--
be
--
maybe
premature
that
for
--
possibly
the
time
to
raise
that
is
after
the
defendant
is
put
on
probation
for
the
others.
thank
you.
