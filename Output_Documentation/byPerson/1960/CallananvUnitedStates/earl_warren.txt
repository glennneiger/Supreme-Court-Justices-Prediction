lawrence
callanan,
petitioner,
versus
the
united
states.
mr.
shenker,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
you
reading
from
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
appendix.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gilinsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
don't
you
think
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
perhaps
just
proving
the
conspiracy
that
a
man
intended
to
do
something
on
the
one
hand
without
proving
any
--
that
they
actually
did
anything
and
on
the
other
hand,
proving
that
they
actually
did
commit
extortion
and
robbery.
don't
you
think
that
that
would
make
a
difference
in
punishment
that
might
lead
them
to
be
interested
in
the
substantive
offenses
as
well
as
the
--
the
conspiracy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
say
then
--
why
do
you
say
then
that
wouldn't
no
--
they
wouldn't
have
to
go
any
farther,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
--
where
they
proved
anything
except
there
was
a
conspiracy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
put
it
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
may
i
just
finish
this?
the
bill
started
out
with
a
maximum
of
99
years.
do
you
think
that
the
attorney
general
when
he
wrote
this
letter,
merely
saying
that
i
have
--
we
have
added
a
new
provision
prohibiting
conspiracy
as
well
as
a
substantive
act,
do
you
think
that
he
did
that
because
he
--
he
thought
that
99
years
was
inadequate
and
that
he
have
to
have
additional
punishment
in
--
for
these
people?
chief
justice
earl
warren
submitted,
what
you've
been
arguing
to
us
now,
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
don't
think
counsel
disagrees
with
you
that
counsel
--
congress
intended
to
punish
conspiracy
as
well
as
the
--
the
commission
of
the
substantive
offense.
but
i
think
where
he
does
disagree
with
you
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
pile
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
he
--
he
cites
the
--
all
of
these
colloquies
between
the
--
the
proponents
and
opponents
of
the
--
of
the
bill
to
show
that
they
were
treating
more
or
less
with
group
action
there
and
that
there
was
--
there
was
never
anything
said
throughout
the
entire
debate
about
filing
conspiracy
upon
the
substantive
offense
that
--
and
they
treated
it
as
though
it
was
either-or.
now,
are
you
going
to
address
yourself
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
not?
why
wouldn't
this
be
discussed
when
they
are
addressing
themselves
to
the
--
to
the
severity
of
--
of
the
offense?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
you
could
--
if
--
if
you
can
punish
a
man
not
for
20
years
but
40
years,
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
normal
thing
for
them
to
--
to
discuss
in
the
congress?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn't
have
to
do
anything.
they
didn't
have
to
say
anything,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
then
reasonable
to
think
they
would've
discussed
that
with
the
people
objecting
to
the
maximum
punishment
of
20
years
if
--
if
it
was
stated
there
that
the
punishment
could
be
not
20
but
40,
do
you
not
think
that
would
have
been
at
least
reasonable
subject
for
discussion
in
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
the
1922
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
was
the
only
--
it
all
wasn't
directed
to
the
sherman
act,
this
discussion.
that
was
one
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
make
that
in
a
tale
was
the
--
whether
words
were
used.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
make
every
tale
out
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
wasn't
the
way
you
presented
it.

justice
earl
warren

glazer.
