justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
ask
--
did
you
ask
judge
weber
to
make
the
second
sentence,
a
concurrent
sentence.
i
noticed
that
he
suspended
the
imposition
of
service
of
it.
what's
the
situation
about
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
who
was
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
what
i
was
--
sort
of
thought,
gathered
here.
if
as
a
matter
of
fact,
sentence
has
not
been
imposed,
you
wouldn't
be
hurt,
would
you
on
second
count?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
you
actually
--
one
more
question
about
it.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker

you
actually
move

judge
weber
to
revise
the
sentence?

charles

not
understand
mr.
shenker

deny
that

it
that
the
conspiracy

in
this
doctrine,
but
he
--
he
says
the
question
still
is
whether
or
not,
congress
even
then
intended
to
increase
and
make
a
new
--
a
new
penalty.
how
does
this
aid
us
very
much
in
determining
that
question?
justice

e.
whittaker
or
does

at
all,
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i'm
going
to
do
your
