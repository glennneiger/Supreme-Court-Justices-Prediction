justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
clear
my
mind.
how
many
were
on
the
total
venire
for
the
week
to
try
cases?
how
many
jurors?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
discretionary
power,
that
implies
that
the
discretion
was
exercised
on
something
or
on,
hasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
on
what
was
what
you
call
the
discretion
exercise.
that
commissioners
--
the
jury
--
the
jury
selectors
didn't
examine
each
one
of
the
potential
jurors,
white
and
color,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
--
on
the
basis
of
how
many
was
the
selection
made
if
you
straighten
me
out?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
with
reference
to
the
selection
of
this
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
the
basis
--
how
many
--
on
the
basis
of
how
many
in
exact
number
was
the
selection
of
the
12
here
made?
justice
felix
frankfurter
68.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
from
the
68,
how
many,
to
start
with,
were
white
as
against
colored
or
colored
as
against
white?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
those
five
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
--
those
five
were
drawn
out
of
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i
don't
mean
of
the
total.
out
of
those
five
negroes
were
drawn
out
of
a
total
pool
of
how
many
negroes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
150.
now
did
he
make
a
custody
exercise
of
personal
judgment
as
to
each
one
of
the
150
or
did
he
go
as
you
suggested
the
local
--
the
general
store,
the
grocery
and
talk
with
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
do
we
know
whether
he
selected
the
five
act
of
personal
inspection,
of
personal
examination
of
inquiry
of
each
of
the
150
face-to-face,
probably
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
did
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
what
you
call
an
exercise
of
discretion
was
based
on
some
--
was
derived
from
a
basis
other
than
his
own
determination
when
he
saw
john
smith
that
john
smith
would
not
be
a
good
perspective
juror,
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
questioning
it.
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
basis
of
the
choice
what
you
call
in
answer
to
justice
black's
question.
he
exercised
discretion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
when
we
have
this
drop
which
raises
questions
of
how
did
it
come
about.
it
might
come
about
because
in
a
particular
year,
in
a
particular
era,
in
a
particular
county,
there
may
have
been
only
two
personal
inspections
five
whom
in
his
judgment
would
qualify.
but
that
isn't
the
situation
we
had.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
he
relied
on
somebody
else
or
somebody
else's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
three
of
them
--
whether
three
of
them.
the
three
of
them
relied
not
on
the
personal
examination
and
judgment
upon
the
individual
150,
but
some
secondary
source.
is
that
right?
i
don't
mean
by
secondary
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
derogate
from
the
force.
all
i'm
trying
to
search
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
couldn't
or
--
or
could
you,
unless
the
record
shows
it,
you
couldn't,
there
was
a
record,
say
that
he
did
a
sampling
on
the
basis
of
which
he
rejected
104
--
on
the
basis
of
which
the
juror
commissioners
rejected
145.
that's
what
this
gets
down
to,
doesn't
it?
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you've
said
the
--
i
asked
you
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
five
negroes
were
out
of
a
potential
body
of
how
many
negroes?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
what
i
say.
so
145
were
rejected
through
sampling
of
the
150
of
the
--
through
sampling,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
were
the
150
put
into
the
box
to
be
picked
out
from?
justice
felix
frankfurter
colored,
names
and
by
chance,
they
just
picked
five
and
yet
out
of
the
white
names,
they
picked
x
out
of
y,
whatever
it
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
this
--
so
that
the
--
the
selection
you
say
was
based
on
--
on
chance,
on
the
--
on
the
(voice
overlap)
on
the
impersonalness
and
the
disinterestedness
of
chance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
where
--
where
did
the
--
where
did
the
discretion
come
in?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
well
that
i
so
understood
in
evident
added
and
put
my
questions
correctly.
in
making
up
the
list
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
rejected
or
the
commissioners
rejected
how
many
out
of
how
many?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
is
that
important
if
--
if
out
of
a
potential
body
of
jurors,
how
many
--
only
an
--
an
unfair
ratio
that
from
the
colored
jurors
was
left
as
against
the
whites
and
if
it
occurs
regularly,
then
i'd
like
to
know
where
discretion
played
its
part?
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
--
even
the
way
which
you
indicate
by
going
to
the
grocery
stores
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
the
local
teacher
or
doctor
or
whatnot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
there's
a
disproportion
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
there's
a
disproportion
in
the
result
of
this
process,
isn't
there
so
far
as
numbers
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
problem
that
would
come
before
us.
whether
this
--
this
proportion
is
the
product
of
--
of
fair
judgment
on
relevant
materials
or
is
a
product
of
the
chances
of
life,
the
contingencies
of
life
or
whether
it
is
a
product
of
starting
out
to
say
we're
not
going
to
have
more
than
x
number
of
negroes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
there
was
nothing
like
that
either
in
the
cassell
case
that
the
reference
has
been
made
to
that.
and
for
myself,
if
something
operates
discriminatorily,
uniformly,
then
there's
--
then
it
isn't
the
operation
of
either
chance
or
--
or
discretion
based
on
relevant
criteria
because
the
dice
don't
always
fall
seven-eleven
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
even
for
the
(voice
overlap)
draw.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
how
do
you
account
for
this
discrepancy?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
are
you
saying
that
the
juror
of
the
commission
going
around
and
making
an
honest
effort
to
find
out
according
to
his
life
who
was
serviceable
jurors,
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
one
function
of
being
a
juror,
he
went
through
the
grocery
store
and
he
went
to
the
local
doctor
and
he
went
to
the
teacher
and
whatnot.
and
they
said,
there
is
jones
and
there
is
smith
and
there
is
robinson.
and
--
and
apparently,
those
are
the
only
ones
his
recommenders
could
give
him,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
potentialities,
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
they
say,
well
i
wouldn't
have
him.
i
wouldn't
have
him.
and
you
say
it's
the
result
of
that
kind
of
as
saying
the
people
under,
there's
tool
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
judgment
of
his
advisers,
his
own
knowledge
(inaudible)
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
clark.
justice
felix
frankfurter
these
are
perhaps
broad
questions.
has
the
attorney
general
of
alabama
any
relation
to
the
jury
selecting
process?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
--
when
do
they
derive
their
standards
for
selecting
jurors?
i
know
the
statute
is
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
who
tells
them,
who
is
it?
is
it
the
local
judge?
could
the
attorney
general
send
out
a
general
letter
of
instructions
or
advice
or
information
saying,
"we
have
carefully
studied
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
which
are
ultimately
governing
to
this
matter
and
we
would
like
to
enumerate
what
it
is
that
you
can
come
in
compliance
with
those
decisions
in
the
light
of
the
statute,"
because
there's
no
suggestion
here,
but
the
statute
as
such,
is
there
--
is
unconstitutional?
justice
felix
frankfurter
discrimination
isn't
written
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
therefore,
it's
a
question
of
the
tools
that
were
given
to
them,
namely,
the
statute
how
they
should
use
those
tools.
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
there
been
any
such
general
instruction
by
anybody
either
the
attorney
general's
office
or
the
court
to
which
the
jury
commissioners
were
attached
in
whatever
way
they
are
attached?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
every
jury
commissioner
is
guided
by
his
own
life
or
what
he's
heard,
what
these
decisions
are.
justice
felix
frankfurter
suppose
you
were
coming
back
from
this
argument,
suppose
you
were
attorney
general
or
you
could
--
could
be
your
chief,
suppose
there
were
such
a
letter
of
instruction
or
--
or
recommendation,
could
you
as
you
stand
there,
formulate
what
you
conceive
to
be
the
duties
of
jury
commissioner
in
the
light
of
our
decision,
what
would
you
tell
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know,
but
they
--
nobody
suggested
that
they
consciously
discriminated
in
this
case,
do
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it's
the
operation
of
a
system
on
misconception
of
what
--
how
that
system
is
to
work.
that's
what
he
gets
down
to,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
people
might
as
honest
as
days
long
or
more
honest
than
a
24-hour
day.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
yet
misconceive
what
it
is
that
their
duty
is.
that's
--
that's
the
real
problem
and
that
this
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
what
kind
of
a
population
--
how
large
a
population
would
that
cover?
can
you
make
a
guess
on
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
said,
said
seven
negroes
and
three
whites?
justice
felix
frankfurter
three
whites.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
--
have
your
counties
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
your
counties
in
which
the
county's
almost
completely
negro
--
negro
population?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
there
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
would
have
to
know
what
a
felony
is
in
alabama.
