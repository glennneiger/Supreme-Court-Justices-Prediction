mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
this
point
that
the
discrimination
about
which
we're
talking
exist
on
two
levels.
first,
there
is
the
shocking
disproportion
of
only
1
in
12
in
a
county
which
is
about
evenly
divided
in
population.
but
even
more
shocking
than
that
is
the
fact
that
only
once
has
a
negro
ever
graduated,
so
to
speak,
from
the
panel
to
the
grand
jury
itself,
and
that
once
was
about
five
or
six
years
ago.
and
we
are
pointing
to
both
those
aspects
of
discrimination
not
merely
the
disproportion
of
1
in
12
about
which
there
has
been
some
discussion.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
no,
at
this
point,
i'm
merely
talking
about
the
grand
jury.
there's
only
1
in
12
on
the
panel
--
1
in
12
in
the
box.
panels
end
up
about
1
in
12
also.
then
the
names
are
picked
from
a
--
a
hat,
from
the
panel
going
to
the
grand
jury
of
18
and
a
negro
never
gets
on
it.
now,
the
--
in
connection
with
that,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
some
of
the
language
in
avery
against
georgia.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
i
--
i
don't
know.
the
--
mr.hall
might
be
able
to
tell
me.
i
believe
that,
as
i
read
that
colloquy
on
the
last
page
of
the
record,
that
the
state
struck
them.
the
state
said,
"now,
i
want
the
record
to
show
that
the
defendant
struck
these
two
jurors
and
defendant
lewis,
and
the
--
wait
a
minute,
that's
not
true,
the
states
struck
them."
and
then
the
counsel
for
the
state
said,
"well,
i'm
sorry,
i
made
a
mistake,
i
withdraw
everything
that
i
said."
now,
that
is
not
a
flat
admission,
but
i
--
i
think
it
raises
a
very
strong
inference
that
it
was
the
state,
in
fact,
who
struck
them.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
--
i
read
from
this
record
here
--
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
well,
i
can
ask
mr.hall
right
now.
he
says
that
the
state
struck
them.
he
was
at
the
trial.
but
the
--
the
colloquy
does
give
rise
to
that
inference
on
page
62
of
the
record.
mr.
mccloud,
the
counsel
for
the
--
the
solicitor
said,
"i
want
to
make
a
statement."
this
is
the
fact
that
negroes
were
drawn,
summons
and
did
appear
in
the
courtroom
and
the
state
of
alabama
did
not
strike
all
of
these
jury
lists,
the
defense
struck
part
of
them.
and
the
court
said,
"alright."
then
attorney
billingsley
said,
"i
don't
quite
understand
what
mr.mccloud
is
saying.
he
said
before
our
contention
is
relative
to
the
motion
filed
yesterday."
there
were
some
negroes
on
the
jury
and
the
states
struck
them.
and
then
mr.mccloud
said,
"i
beg
your
pardon."
and
further
down
he
says,
"i
apologize.
i
withdraw
everything
i
said
with
reference
to
that."
i
won't
contend
that
that's
absolutely
clear.
i
think
it
raises
the
inference
that
the
state
struck
them
there.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
that
was
the
petit
jury,
yes.
so
far
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned,
as
i
say
that
1
in
12
in
a
county
by
evenly
divided
is
--
is
quite
a
shocking
disproportion
which
calls
for
some
explanation,
but
even
more
shocking
is
that
nobody
ever
is
promoted
from
the
panel
of,
let's
say,
68
to
the
grand
jury
itself,
except
this
single
individual.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
in
1953
or
1954.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
the
record
does
not
show.
jury
commissioner
vaguely
recollected
that
there
had
been
a
negro
and
then
a
juror
who
was
vice
president
of
the
bank
in
town,
i
believe,
at
that
term
of
the
court,
testified
that
he
had
served
on
that
jury
and
there
was
a
negro
on
the
jury
with
him
whose
name
was
roosevelt
dawson.
that's
all
the
record
shows
in
that
respect.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
is
that
also
capital
offenses?
no
not
from
mr.
hall,
definitely
not
for
capital
--
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
not
for
capital
--
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
i'm
--
i'm
sorry
that
i
--
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
mr.hall
says
that
no
information
for
felony
so
far
as
he
know.
the
--
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
the
question
arises
as
to
how
this
occurred
and
the
state
takes
the
position
that
no
negro
has
ever
ended
up
on
the
grand
jury
as
a
result
of
pure
chance.
and
apparently,
are
just
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
demonstrate
how
this
is
done.
in
that
connection,
we
submit
that
the
language
of
avery
against
georgia
is
--
is
entirely
pertinent
in
which
the
opinion
of
the
court
said,
"that
the
court
below
affirmed
however
because
petitioner
had
failed
to
prove
some
particular
act
of
discrimination
by
some
particular
officer
responsible
for
the
selection
of
the
jury.
and
the
state
now
argues
that
it
is
petitioner's
burden
to
fill
this
factual
vacuum.
we
cannot
agree
if
there
was
a
vacuum
that
is
one
which
the
state
must
fill
by
moving
in
with
sufficient
evidence
to
dispel
the
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination.
that's
the
situation
which
we
submit
we
have
here.
there
has
been
some
suggestion
by
the
state
that
there
has
apparently
been
some
waiver
of
the
questions
presented
here
in
the
court
below.
we
submit
the
record
clearly
shows
that
these
questions
were
presented
and
preserved
that
every
stage
of
litigation
below,
motion
to
quash
the
indictment
uses
language
which
was
repeated
later
in
a
motion
to
quash
the
venire
and
a
motion
challenge
in
the
composition
of
the
jury,
the
motion
for
new
trial,
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama.
and
that
language
is
--
the
language
charges
that
negroes
are
excluded
from
grand
juries
organizing
said
county
and
state
solely
because
of
their
race
and
color
or
--
or
discriminated
against
in
the
organization
of
grand
juries
in
said
county
of
said
state
solely
because
of
their
race
or
color.
and
that
no
member
of
said
race
or
a
mere
token
number
are
included
on
the
jury
roll
or
have
their
names
placed
in
the
jury
box
or
if
they
are
placed
on
the
jury
roll
or
in
the
jury
box,
they
are
not
drawn
for
service
on
any
grand
jury.
and
that
is,
in
fact,
what
petitioner
claims
occurred
in
this
case.
so
far
as
the
--
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
it
was
both.
mr.
mr.jack
greenberg
both.
the
--
some
statement
by
the
respondent
that
the
figure
of
1800
names
in
the
jury
box
is
only
a
guess,
this
man
was
the
chairman
of
the
jury
commission.
he
was
a
person
principally
charged
with
the
duties
of
conducting
the
business
of
the
jury
commission.
there
was
no
objection
to
his
testimony.
i
might
point
out
that
when
he
took
the
stand
the
first
time,
he
concluded
his
testimony
by
asking,
"may
i
make
a
statement?"
there
was
an
objection.
he
was
not
permitted
to
make
a
statement.
he
was
later
recalled
to
the
stand
at
which
time
he
testified
a
second
time.
and
certainly,
if
there
were
anything
to
correct
or
any
additional
testimony
or
not
only
was
it
--
within
the
power
of
the
state
as
a
general
proposition,
but
this
particular
witness
had
a
later
opportunity
to
correct
anything
that
he
said
at
this
time.
we
submit
that
on
the
record
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
but
that
there
has
been
racial
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
jury.
