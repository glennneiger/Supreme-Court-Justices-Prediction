mr.
jack
greenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
under
title
28,
u.s.c.
1257
(3),
petitioner
having
asserted
in
the
courts
below
various
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
conferred
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
particularly
the
right
of
petitioner,
a
negro
clergyman,
to
be
indicted
and
tried
by
grand
and
petit
juries
from
which
members
of
his
race
were
not
systematically
excluded
because
of
race.
petitioner
was
indicted
for
murder
in
the
second
degree
for
an
automobile
accident.
he
was
convicted
of
manslaughter
in
the
first
degree
and
received
the
maximum
penalty
of
10
years
imprisonment.
he
applied
to
the
--
he
appealed
to
alabama
court
of
appeals,
where
he
raised
the
jury
question.
it
was
passed
upon,
the
conviction
was
affirmed.
he
applied
to
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
denied
and
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court.
the
evidence
in
the
case
is
succinct
and
uncontradicted.
dallas
county,
alabama
in
which
this
crime
occurred,
according
to
the
1950
census
have
preponderantly
a
negro
population,
approximately
in
the
ratio
of
8
to
7.
i
might
say
that
the
1960
census
figures
are
not
yet
officially
available,
but
an
informal
inquiry
indicates
to
me
that
the
ratio
is
now
approximately
equal
with
the
population
being
about
6.5
to
6
in
favor
of
white
persons.
nevertheless,
the
--
at
all
times,
the
population
ratio
was
approximately
50-50.
mr.
jack
greenberg
this
is
a
county.
yes,
it's
about
two
counties
west
of
montgomery,
near
the
mississippi
border.
despite
the
large
number
of
negro
citizens,
either
a
majority
or
very
slightly
less
than
the
majority,
only
once
in
the
entire
history
of
the
county
has
a
negro
ever
served
on
a
grand
jury
in
this
county
and
this
was
five
years
ago,
before
the
present
solicitor
took
office.
the
solicitor
testified
on
page
12
of
the
record
and
this
is
the
heart
of
the
case,
how
often
are
grand
juries
organized
in
dallas
county?
answer:
twice
a
year.
question:
and
you
have
attended
the
organization
since
1954?
the
answer
is,
affirmative.
since
that
time
how
many
negroes
served
on
any
grand
jury
in
dallas
county?
answer:
none.
did
any
serve
on
the
present
grand
jury?
answer:
they
did
not.
the
testimony
concerning
the
one
negro
who
served
a
number
of
years
ago
was
given
by
a
jury
member
who
testified
that
at
time
when
he
was
on
a
jury,
he
did
see
a
single
negro
on
a
grand
jury
at
that
time.
now,
the
court
below
held
that
the
jury
roll
in
this
case,
that
is
the
list
of
names
of
prospective
jurors,
was
based
upon
a
foundation
laid
in
the
case
of
fikes
versus
alabama.
the
jury
rolls
in
alabama
are
a
continuing
document
in
which
names
are
continuously
added
and
struck,
if
they
become
eligible
or
ineligible.
and
that
in
1953,
according
to
the
record
in
the
fikes
case
and
we
see
this
discussed
on
page
71
of
this
record,
there
were
approximately
1500
names
on
the
jury
roll
of
which
250
to
300
were
the
names
of
negroes.
that
is
about
one-fifth.
since
1953,
names
have
been
added
to
and
dropped
from
the
rolls
and
according
to
the
testimony
of
the
chairman
of
the
jury
commission
in
this
case,
the
ratio
of
1
to
5
has
dropped
to
a
ratio
of
1
to
12,
because
the
number
of
negroes
has
declined
precipitously
and
this
small
fraction
exists
despite
the
fact
that
the
population
was
approximately,
50%
negro.
there
are
series
of
alabama
statutes
which
appear
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
which
set
forth
the
method
by
which
jurors
are
to
be
selected
in
dallas
county
and
--
oh,
selected
in
alabama,
including
dallas
county.
and
these
statutes
title
30
code
of
alabama
18
states,
“that
the
clerk
of
the
jury
commission
is
to
obtain
the
name
of
every
male
citizen
in
the
county.”
title
20
says,
“the
jury
commission
shall
meet
and
so
forth
and
shall
make
in
a
well
bound
book,
a
role
containing
the
name
of
every
male
citizen
in
the
county.”
and
section
21
which
recites,
“qualifications
of
persons
on
the
jury
roll,
refers
to
the
names
of
all
male
citizens.”
nevertheless
despite
the
fact
that
the
statute
imposes
minimum
qualifications,
it
does
not
even
require
an
ability
to
read
english.
it
explicitly
says,
that
you
need
not
be
able
to
read
english
if
you
are
a
freehold
or
a
household,
you
would
need
a
--
need
not
even
be
a
property
owner
or
merely
a
householder.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
were
five
negroes
on
the
panel
of
whom
three
could
not
be
found.
therefore,
actually
when
the
panel
appeared
in
court
there
were
two.
none
of
those
served
on
the
jury,
the
grand
jury
or
the
petit
jury
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
best
i
can
say
is
that
--
and
the
state
says
this
is
also,
“the
record
contains
innuendo
that
they
were
challenged
by
the
state,”
but
that's
not
clear.
mr.
jack
greenberg
apparently
not,
apparently
not.
the
jury
commissioners
rather
than
selecting
the
name
of
every
qualified
male
citizen
of
the
county
relied
upon
a
system
of
personal
inquiry.
and
on
page
35
to
36
of
the
record,
we
find
the
chairman's
description
of
how
he
went
about
selecting
jurors.
well,
i
go
to
different
parts
of
the
county
and
know
good
men
and
ask
them
about
folks
and
other
jury
commissioners
have
done
the
same
thing,
a
good
many
i
know
personally.
and
he
then
testified
what
do
you
--
where
do
you
get
the
list
from?
how
do
arrive
at
the
names
of
those
you're
going
to
interview?
i
talked
to
people,
i
know
citizens,
high
class
folks
of
various
parts
of
the
county
and
i
can
go
by
their
recommendations.
we
try
to
get
good
folks
is
the
way
we
try
to
do.
and
though
he
testified
that
he
introduced
negroes
and
whites
both,
when
asked
for
the
names
of
some
negroes
in
the
interview,
he
said
he
would
decline
to
give
the
names,
because
it
might
embarrass
them.
and
on
page
53
of
the
record,
he
testifies
to
that
effect.
when
he
did
not
know
negroes
in
a
particular
precinct
he
said,
he
would
talk
to
some
good
white
folks
in
the
county
and
some
here
in
town.
that's
on
page
53
of
the
record.
the
panels
in
this
county
consist
of
approximately
60
to
90
persons.
of
--
of
those
60
to
90,
the
number
of
negroes
has
varied
from
about
2
to
6.
and
this
on
--
testimony
of
the
record
by
an
average
maximum
of
seven
but
i
--
the
general
sense
of
the
record
is
that
2
to
6
or
2
to
7
and
sometimes,
some
might
be
found
and
some
not
--
might
not
be
found.
in
this
particular
case,
of
the
five
available
negroes
on
the
panel,
three
were
not
found
and
60%
of
them
were
not
found.
over
the
white
persons
available,
a
number
also
were
not
found
at
the
exhibits
on
pages
25
and
26
of
the
record
indicate,
but
that
of
course,
was
a
much
smaller
percentage,
nowhere
near
60%.
it's
somewhat
in
excess
of
20%
of
the
white
persons
were
not
found.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well
no,
i'm
sorry.
it
did
not
serve.
i
--
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
they
--
they
were
found,
but
they
asked
for
excuses,
i
would
say.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
i'm
--
i'm
quite
sorry.
the
--
they
were
excused.
it's
not
that
they
were
not
found.
they
were
excused,
but
i'm
sorry
i
conveyed
the
--
the
question.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
1800
names.
mr.
jack
greenberg
1800
--
that's
venire
i'm
sorry,
no,
the
venire
is
--
in
this
case,
with
68
names.
it
varies
from
60
to
90.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
two
--
they
or
--
for
twice
a
year,
they
--
they
call
panels.
twice
a
year
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
twice
a
year.
mr.
jack
greenberg
they
pull
names
out
of
the
hat
or
out
of
the
box.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes
--
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
particular
term
of
the
court,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
there
are
sometimes
special
terms
also,
but
fundamentally
two
terms.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
aware
of
that.
i
don't
know.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
he
does
mr.
holmes
wasn't
either
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
21
to
65.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
don't
believe
if
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
one
was
excused
because
of
number
66,
young
child
is
i
believe,
was
excused
and
next
to
his
name
is
noted,
over
65.
mr.
jack
greenberg
over
65,
that's
all
it
says.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
it
does
not,
no.
to
explain
this
small
number
of
negroes
on
the
panel
--
that
is
1
in
12
on
--
in
the
jury
rolls
that
is
1
in
12
and
the
fact
that
none
have
ever
appeared
in
the
grand
jury,
the
state
has
produced
with
this
one
exception.
the
state
has
produced
evidence
that
85%
of
the
persons
arrested
in
the
county
are
negroes.
when
the
states
--
when
the
sheriff
was
questioned
as
to
whether
that
meant
that
85%
of
the
negroes
were
arrested,
he
said,
“no.”
that
meant
85%
of
persons
arrested
were
negroes,
which
could
mean
anywhere
from
1%
up
--
it's
completely
meaningless
statistic,
but
at
any
rate,
85%
of
the
persons
arrested
are
negroes.
this
included
approximately
25%
repeaters,
approximately
15%
to
20%
traffic
offenses
and
other
petty
crimes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
on
the
roll
or
in
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
was
in
1800
in
the
wheel.
in
--
there
was
--
in
1953
there
were
1500
of
which
300
were
negroes.
by
the
time
of
this
case,
the
number
in
the
wheel
had
increased
to
1800
of
whom
one-twelfth
were
negroes,
which
i
gather
is
about
150.
in
other
words
the
number
of
negroes
has
been
decreasing
since
1953.
that's
quite
clear.
it's
going
down
from
a
fifth
to
a
twelfth.
the
roll
has
increased
from
1500
to
1800.
the
number
of
negroes
has
decreased
from
a
fifth
to
a
twelfth.
there's
no
contradiction
about
that
at
all
and
i
don't
gather
that's
challenged
at
all.
no
question
about
that.
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
in
selecting
the
panels.
i'm
referring
to
the
fikes
case,
which
incidentally
was
in
this
court
on
the
jury
question
among
other
things,
but
was
reversed
on
the
basis
of
course,
confession.
it
said
that
at
--
in
1953,
there
were
1500
on
the
panel,
of
whom
a
fifth
were
negroes.
it
said
that
the
court
had
evidence
of
the
arrests
of
that
--
of
--
there
was
a
--
the
judge
could
take
judicial
notice
of
a
large
number
of
negro
dependency
had
before
him
in
criminal
trials,
although
no
evidence
was
offered
on
this
by
either
side.
that
petitioner
had
not
shown
coercion
and
that
petitioner
had
not
produced
the
jury
rolls
themselves
in
open
court.
the
respondents
in
this
case
rest
upon
these
findings
of
the
alabama
court
of
appeals,
plus
an
assertion
that
the
petitioners
here
assert
some
sort
of
right
to
proportional
representation
in
jury
selection.
the
petitioners
assert
nothing
of
this
sort.
we
recognize
that
proportional
representation
violates
the
constitution
as
set
forth
in
the
cassell
case
that
it
constitutes
inclusion
as
well
as
exclusion
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
petitioners
do
not
assert
there
is
--
and
could
not
assert
that
there
is
any
right
of
proportional
representation
in
this
case.
but
the
petitioners
do
contend
that
in
a
long
and
on
varying
series
of
cases,
when
this
court
has
been
confronted
with
a
gross
statistical
disparity
--
not
this
in
the
brown
against
allen
when
he
was
about
6.7%
in
the
population
and
this
is
about
--
or
16%
in
the
population
about
6.7%
on
the
rolls
or
in
cassell,
6.7%
as
against
6.5%.
one
of
these
gross
disparities
of
a
third
and
non-ending
up
on
juries,
or
50%
as
in
some
cases,
the
court
then
says
a
--
the
petitioner
has
met
this
burden
--
has
created
a
prima
facie
case
and
is
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
come
forth
with
some
sort
of
explanation
of
why
this
situation
exists.
now,
the
state
has
in
this
case
come
forth
--
come
forth
with
an
explanation
and
its
explanation
consists
of
we
submit,
an
utterly
meaningless
statistic,
that
is
85%
of
the
persons
arrested
are
negroes
with
an
explicit
disclaimer
that
this
means
that
85%
of
the
negroes
in
the
county
are
arrested.
now,
we
submit,
this
does
not
meet
the
burden.
it
does
not
constitute
any
meeting
of
the
prima
facie
case
that
we
have
made,
that
no
negro
with
one
exception
six
years
ago
has
ever
ended
up
on
a
grand
jury
in
this
county.
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
whose
--
his
opinion
in
the
cassell
case,
which
has
reflected
the
long
line
of
opinions
in
this
area.
he
said
that
if
one
factor
is
uniformed
in
a
continuing
series
of
events
that
have
brought
the
past
through
human
intervention,
the
law
would
have
to
have
the
blindness
of
indifference,
rather
than
the
blindness
of
impartiality,
not
to
attribute
the
uniform
factor
demands
purpose.
and
we
submit
that
certainly
that
sort
of
case
has
been
made
here
and
that
no
evidence
has
been
given
to
reply.
moreover,
we
rely
on
justice
reed's
opinion
in
the
cassell
case,
an
opinion
which
was
not
--
did
not
support
the
--
did
not
constitute
the
opinion
of
the
court,
but
the
opinion
of
the
four
justices
to
the
effect
that
when
the
jury
commissioners
rely
upon
a
system
of
going
out
among
their
personal
acquaintances
of
people
that
they
know
in
selecting
jurors
especially
in
a
county
where
there
is
a
state
statute
setting
forth
minimal
objective
standards
of
that
--
in
a
situation
such
as
exists
in
dallas
county,
alabama,
this
is
almost
--
almost
inevitably
results
in
a
gross
disproportion
such
as
we
have
found
in
this
case
and
we
submit
that
the
state
has
not
met
the
burden
of
--
of
overcoming
either
of
those
two
propositions.
