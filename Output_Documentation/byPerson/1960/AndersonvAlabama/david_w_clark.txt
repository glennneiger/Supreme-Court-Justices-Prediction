mr.
david
w.
clark
thank
you,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.greenberg
yesterday
afternoon
gave
his
summary
of
the
case
which
he
substantially
covered
the
facts.
however,
i
noted
few
discrepancies
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
before
i
proceed
with
my
argument.
there
were
some
mention
of
some
perspective
jurors
not
being
found
and
that
they
were
negroes,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
shows
whether
they
were
whites
or
negroes.
in
fact,
it
appears
that
all
five
negroes
were
called
at
this
jury
--
on
this
jury.
and
while
i'm
mentioning
that
exhibit,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
they're
excused
and
they're
not
found
and
the
members
who
were
struck
were
all
marked
in
red
ink.
there's
no
discrimination
as
to
whether
they
were
not
found
or
excused.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
there
is
not,
sir.
all
the
cards
contained
and
they're
all
white
cards.
they
have
the
man's
name,
his
occupation
and
where
he
lives.
there
is
nothing
that
would
indicate
his
race,
color
or
creed.
mr.
david
w.
clark
may
it
please
the
court.
my
only
information
on
that
is
fikes
versus
state,
in
which
they
said
that
in
the
old
jury
roll
was
urged,
there
was
a
new
one
which
contained
approximately
1500
names
of
which
250
or
300
were
negroes.
that
is
my
only
information
on
that,
your
honor.
i
should
like
to
point
out
in
the
record
on
page
61
that
if
the
hearing
on
these
motions
that
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
made
no
objection
except
to
the
--
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
jury
roll.
now,
the
court,
speaking
to
attorney
gray
says,
"do
you
make
any
claim
in
either
of
the
grounds
that
there
had
been
an
arbitrary
conduct
in
this
court
as
far
as
this
venire
is
concerned
that
arbitrarily
excluded
any
negro
that
might
be
on
this
venire
observance
in
this
--
on
this
jury?"
and
attorney
hall
says,
"no,
sir."
"further,
as
i
understand
you
just
simply
say
that
you
don't
think
there
were
enough
negroes
in
the
jury
box
or
some
reason
connected
with
the
jury
roll
or
jury
box."
attorney
hall
says,
"yes,
sir."
that's
on
record
page
71.
mr.
david
w.
clark
61,
sir,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
was
the
petit
jury
venire.
mr.
david
w.
clark
there
was
a
motion,
i
believe,
at
that
time
to
quash
the
venire.
there
was
first
a
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
had
been
qualified
at
that
time,
i
believe.
also,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
positive
record
as
to
who
struck
the
two
remaining
negro
juries
--
jurors.
as
i
point
out,
there
were
five
jurors
called.
one,
i
believe
(inaudible)
was
excused
for
being
over
65,
two
were
excused
for
--
one
had
an
attack
and
one
was
sick,
which
he's
permitted
to
--
for
the
trial
juries
in
alabama
to
excuse
those
men
on
noncapital
cases.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
from
the
discussion
of
the
case,
sir,
only
five
names
are
mentioned.
mr.
david
w.
clark
five
negroes
are
mentioned.
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
the
entire,
i
believe
they
are
68,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
68
people.
mr.
david
w.
clark
there
was
a
hearing
which
they
excuse
some
young
and
then
they
were
strict
on
--
in
accordance
with
alabama
law
of
which
the
state
has
one
strike
and
the
defendant
has
two.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
well,
this
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
this
was
the
entire
venire.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
this
was
that
case
there.
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
this
was
68.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
were
called
less
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
those
who
had
been
excused.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
that
is
in
con
for
alabama
law
and
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
this
was
--
venire
was
drawn
for
this
particular
case.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
that
was
a
grand
jury
that
was
called
for
that
particular
time.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
approximately
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
this
was
a
venire
called
for
the
petit
jury
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
that
actually
tried
the
man
in
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
this
particular
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
says
for
that
week,
drawn
for
that
week,
i
believe.
a
jury
list
criminal
court
february
23rd,
1959
term
that
was
the
exhibit.
and
they
drew
the
12
men
striking
them,
as
i've
said,
for
this
term.
mr.
david
w.
clark
68
less
these
who
have
been
excused.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
and
they
are
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
stricken.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
12
eventually
are
going
to
the
jury
box
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
they
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
they
strike
them.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
--
they
qualify
first.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
qualify.
first,
they
grant
excuses
for
the
--
the
ones
who
asked
to
be
excused
for
various
reasons,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
then
they
qualify
them
as
to
--
that
came
to
the
first
and
a
thing
of
that
nature
that
would
disqualify
them
and
then
when
they
are
down
to
the
--
the
rest
of
the
jurors
on
there,
then
the
--
the
last
step
is
for
the
state
enter
--
entered
to
strike
the
jury
of
the
remaining
people
on
this
list.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
possible,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
sir,
in
--
in
this
case,
it
was
not
alphabetically.
they
were
just
drawn
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
they're
just
drawn
out
of
the
hat
and
input
the
--
the
names
are
put
in
down.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
appears
to
be
near
that.
they're
not
alphabetically
drawn
in
this
case,
sir,
because
here,
we
have
(inaudible).
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
believe
it
wasn't
--
i
believe
that
was
hill
versus
texas
where
they
had
done
that,
if
i'm
not
mistaken
as
to
the
name,
but
in
that
particular
case,
they
had
the
first
12
white
persons
and
after
that,
there
were
negroes
13,
14,
15
and
16
and
it
was
the
custom
of
that
community
to
draw
the
first
way
of
the
grand
juries.
that
did
not
exist
in
these
things.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
was
drawn
in
--
in
the
courtroom.
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
the
courtroom,
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
probably
drawn
a
--
the
cards
as
i've
said
are
white
with
no
distinguishing
marks
as
to
color
of
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
found
no
code
section
require
in
that.
i
think
it
is
use
as
a
practice
sir.
and
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
there
is
no
definite
record
as
to
who
struck
the
remaining
two
negroes
on
the
jury
list
on
page
62
of
the
record.
there
was
a
little
discussion
there
in
open
court,
i
believe,
when
mr.
mccloud
and
attorney
billingsley.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
do
not,
sir.
no,
sir.(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
one
of
them
was
benny
phillips.
i
don't
recall
the
other
nature,
but
he
was
one
of
the
two.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
should
like
further
to
point
out
that
the
question
of
when
a
negro
had
registered
on
the
grand
jury
was
in
1954
or
rather
than
1953.
i
think
this
is
important
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
for
this
reason.
there
had
been
a
new
jury
roll
in
october
of
1953.
if
we
go
on
premise
that
the
--
this
bureau
was
in
1953,
he
would've
been
on
the
old
role
and
he
found
a
new
one
actually.
he
was
called
in
january
of
1954,
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
gerald
hicks
(ph)
on
page
45.
now,
there
was
a
flat
statement
named
at
the
present
time.
there
were
1800
jurors
on
the
jury
roll
and
of
this
number
one
in
every
12,
were
negroes.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
page
--
record
page
34
wherein
mr.
glen
h.
depke,
the
jury
commissioner
and
the
chairman
of
it,
about
two-thirds
down
the
page,
"can
you
tell
the
court,"
excuse
me
--
"how
many
names
are
on
the
jury
list
in
dallas
county
altogether?"
"i
never
count
it.
i
don't
know."
"do
you
have
any
judgment
of
the
number
of
those
names
who
are
negroes?"
"well,
i
don't
know
all
of
them
that
are
registered.
i
don't
know
all
the
whites
or
non-whites,
but
i
guess
1
in
12
would
be
none
white."
"1
in
12?"
"yes."
"would
you
care
to
give
us
some
estimate
of
the
total
number
of
jurors
on
the
register?"
"i
would
guess
somewhere
around
1800.
that
is
--
points
that
i
had
strictly
and
yes
he
does
know
the
exact
number
on
that
and
the
reason
i
want
to
point
that
out
to
the
court
is
that
the
jury
rolls
were
never
requested
to
be
presented
in
the
court
as
on
the
hearing
of
this
motion
as
they
were
in
norris
versus
alabama."
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
exact
number
could've
been
found.
mr.
david
w.
clark
not
from
the
names
themselves.
they'd
have
to
know
it
from
personal
observation
of
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
would
not
do
if
it
gives
the
exact
number.
that's
all
it
would
de
novo
people
on
the
jury
roll.
mr.
david
w.
clark
those
are
all
the
correct
entitled.
mr.
david
w.
clark
make
any
statement
made
by
mr.greenberg.
mr.
david
w.
clark
now,
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
has
cited
in
number
of
cases
using
short
excerpts
from
them
and
stating
or
inferring
that
the
procedure
in
this
case
now
before
the
court,
is
quite
similar
to
these
cases
he'd
cites.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
it
was
out
of
1500
at
that
time,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
may
it
please
the
court.
on
that,
i
would
like
to
point
out
this
mr.glen
h.depke
who
was
appointed
chairman
of
the
jury
commission
in
1954.
and
on
--
this
was
his
first
appearance
in
court,
perhaps
he
was
flustered.
he
says,
"i
guess
they
are
now
1500
or
1800
names
on
the
jury
roll
and
i
guess
that
1
out
of
12
is
non-white."
he
didn't
know
the
exact
number.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
they
are.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
if
they
die
or
move
away
from
that
locality,
they
could
pull
their
names
out.
mr.
david
w.
clark
you
couldn't
and
i
don't
believe
i
could
either
that
there
is
no
identification
on
the
card
itself.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well
a
county
record
would
probably
--
the
birth
record
would
show
whether
person
was
white
or
colored.
mr.
david
w.
clark
or
something
of
that
nature,
but
as
far
as
the
intermediate
records
are
concerned,
there
is
nothing
that
would
identify
him
as
to
race.
mr.
david
w.
clark
just
a
guess
beyond
that,
that's
the
only
thing
i
can
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
was
just
grabbing
one
of
the
air
and
saying
that
that's
1
in
12.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
--
they
authorize
it.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
and
then
the
court
said
and
you
name
that
from
time
to
time.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
that
was
just
said
statement
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
and
that's
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record.
mr.
david
w.
clark
if
they
knew
come
in
(inaudible)
mr.
david
w.
clark
but
it
would
have
been
--
it
is
an
incumbent
on
the
defendant
in
that
case
to
have
called
for
the
jury
roll
if
he
want
to
show
anything
that
he
want
to
point
out
if
he
--
he
knew
that
any
had
been
excluded
or
he
knew
him
by
name
or
race.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
was
chairman
of
the
jury
commission
of
dallas
county.
mr.
david
w.
clark
these
are
all
responsibility,
i
would
say,
but
the
clerk
keeps
the
actual
names
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
to
find
people
but
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
sure
had
the
knowledge
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
he
should
have
a
knowledge.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
may
have
pointed
out
that
he
had
said
that
was
the
guess.
it
--
it
maybe
--
that
or
now
1
in
10
or
i
don't
know.
that
it
was
his
estimate
and
he
kept
saying
it
was
a
guess.
he
didn't
give
up
a
definite
statement
to
that
--
there
are
so
many
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
probably
not,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
was
their
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
do
not.
he
was
a
retired
army
captain.
i
believe
they
refer
to
him
as
captain
death.
as
i
would
--
said
the
petitioner
cited
in
a
number
of
cases
and
was
using
little
excerpts
from
these
cases
in
writing
his
excellent
brief,
in
checking
over
these
cases
he
cited.
however,
i
find
that
they
are
not
exactly
like
in
facts
so
that
they
would
be
as
we
say
on
all
force
with
this
case,
for
instance,
avery
versus
georgia.
that
decision
rested
on
the
ground
that
the
use
of
the
jury
courts
of
white
and
yellow
to
--
to
note
the
race
that
constituted
prima
facie
evidence
of
discrimination.
i
believe
as
this
court
pointed
out
the
box
from
which
these
cards
were
taken
had
an
opening
large
enough
for
the
judge
to
look
in
and
see
whether
that
was
a
white
or
yellow
card.
we
don't
have
anything
like
this
in
the
present
case.
the
judge
reached
in,
pulled
out
a
name,
the
all
name
sort
of
just
written
on
the
cards,
similar
cards,
no
difference
of
cards.
now,
the
other
case
cited
was
cassell
versus
texas.
that
was
a
case
where
the
jury
commissioners
went
off
on
the
idea
following
as
they
interpreted
akins
versus
texas
to
mean
that
as
long
as
they
had
one
negro
on
the
jury
that
that
satisfied
the
requirement
for
such
discrimination
--
that
limitation
of
course,
in
violation.
we
don't
have
this
in
--
in
the
present
case.
now,
in
eubanks
versus
louisiana,
another
case
which
was
cited,
this
court
held
that
while
the
jury
commissioners
selected
75
names
impartially,
that
the
trial
judge
picked
his
grand
jury
from
people
he
knew
personally
and
had
personal
knowledge
of
their
race
and
therefore,
this
was
discrimination.
hernandez
versus
texas,
that
the
court
after
saying
that
the
petition
met
the
burden
of
proof
is
set
out
in
norris
versus
alabama
and
said
that
the
state
has
not
rebutted
this
prima
facie
case.
in
--
in
that
one,
it
seemed
that
the
jury
commissioners
just
left
out
all
names
that
denoted
mexican
or
spanish
descent.
now,
hill
versus
texas
is
another
one.
the
court
held
that
the
--
a
prima
facie
case
was
ade
out
and
the
state
bail
needed.
and
negroes
were
omitted
from
the
grand
jury
list
for
16
years
or
more
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
various
names
had
been
mentioned
to
them
and
they
just
failed
to
carry
out
their
duties
to
investigate
any
of
these
people.
this
wasn't
the
case
here.
we
had
evidence,
mr.depke
that
he
had
gone
out
in
various
parts
of
the
county
and
going
to
stores
and
meeting
places
and
--
and
ask
about
people.
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
that
dallas
county
is
a
rural
community.
and
your
best
source
of
information
is
usually
a
country
grocery
store
in
which
you
go
and
buy
a
soft
drink
and
talk
with
the
owner
and
he
can
tell
you
about
everybody
in
that
vicinity.
now,
there
was
something
said
in
the
testimony
about
if
he
didn't
know
any
particular
negroes
in
that
area.
he
asked
some
good
white
men,
that
may
seem
as
--
that
was
discrimination,
but
in
this
area
of
the
state,
most
of
the
stores
are
run
by
white
men,
the
grocery
stores
or
country
gentle
merchandise
stores
and
he
probably
has
went
and
asked
some
questions.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
i'm
just
pointing
out
there
was
not
on
all
force,
are
not
very
similarly.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
frankly,
i
--
i
don't
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
record
doesn't
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
now,
it
did
show
the
--
the
number
of
negro
and
whites
over
21
males,
i
believe
it
was
6940
white
males
and
7438
negro
males
to
over
21.
now,
it's
gone
in
1950
census.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
but
i
--
i
believe
mr.
greenberg
cited
it
and
i
think
he
said
in
generally,
the
whites
had
a
seventh
grade
education
and
colored
people,
approximately
non-whites,
about
fourth
grade
education.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
we
do.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
they
are.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
page
16
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
is
in
full
sentence.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it's
rather
low
that
they
didn't
see
that,
i
think
we
compared
with
the
other
places.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
don't
go
as
far
in
schools
as
they
do
in
some
of
the
more
populated
counties.
this
is
a
farming
area.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir,
i
don't
have
that
(inaudible)
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
know
the
exact
number,
but
i
think
they
are
deaf
in
minority.
they
cannot
read
or
write
without
brief
in
education.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
they
must
read
and
write
except
that
they
are
free
holders
or
householders
and
that
is
the
waived
in
that
case.
mr.
david
w.
clark
with
those
two
exceptions,
i
just
named
there
would
be.
they
have
to
be
able
to
read
and
write,
unless
they
are
free
holders
or
householders.
mr.
david
w.
clark
everyone,
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
current.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
please
the
court.
i
cited
in
my
brief
the
case
of
wimbush
versus
state
which
is
the
alabama
case,
237
ala.153.
said
the
purpose
of
the
statute
providing
no
objection
may
be
taken
any
venire
jurors
set
to
fraud
in
draw
and
summon
the
jurors,
is
to
prevent
quashing
a
venire
if
i
may,
irregularities
and
to
obviate
result
and
delays.
well,
in
that,
there
was
citing
that
section
46
in
which
you
just
read
and
it
was
stated
there
that
unless
there
was
fraud
in
drawing
or
sounding
the
jurors
that
a
motion
to
quash
would
not
lie
in
that
case.
therefore
that
we
have
the
alabama
condition
determination
that
it
doesn't
require
every
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
does
not
require
--
and
that
is
of
course,
that
case
was
1939
and
that
came
after
that
attorney
general's
opinion
cited
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
the
record
doesn't
show
any
--
any
reason
for
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
there
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
may
it
please
the
court
in
that
--
that
invades
the
discretionary
power.
the
jury
commissioner
it
says
that
they
shall
go
out
and
--
and
check
on
these
people
and
as
the
requirements
so
that
each
jurors
must
be
honest
and
intelligent
and
have
their
reputation
for
integrity
and
good
character
and
sound
judgment
in
that
community.
mr.
david
w.
clark
so
they
have
some
discretion
in
that,
it
would
--
it
does
follow
that
because
every
white
person,
when
he
became
21,
he
would
not
of
itself,
be
a
prospective
juror
that
would
not
--
the
qualification
of
a
negro.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
your
honor,
the
one
thing
i
could
think
of,
just
off
hand
is
that
the
jury
commissioners
put
more
names
of
whites
than
they
did
of
the
negro
race.
now,
whether
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
(voice
overlap)
that
goes
along
with
the
discretionary
power
of
the
jury
commissioners
to
--
to
lay
it.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
they
are
the
one
who
counted.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
there
were
approximately
14,000
of
both
white
and
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
negro
race.
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
ones
--
well,
there
were
68
to
start
with,
some
were
excused,
i
would
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
say
around
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--
40
people
were
left
to
be
struck
and
there
were
two
missing.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
it
was
definitely
shown
that
there
were
five
negroes
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
those
are
the
ones
not
found.
mr.
david
w.
clark
5
out
of
68.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
if
we
follow
mr.depke's
guess
that
would
be
out
of
150.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
he
said
he,
in
his
testimony,
said
he
went
to
various
people
and
talk
with
them.he
talked
to
some
prospective
jurors.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
from
his
testimony,
he
did
not.
mr.
david
w.
clark
he
did
not.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
well,
the
statute
says
about
the
reputation
in
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
there
are
three
jury
commissioners.
mr.
david
w.
clark
there
are
three
jury
commissioners
in
that
case
that
may
have
been
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
realize
what
you
mean
now.
mr.
david
w.
clark
from
his
statement,
he
said
that
he
interviewed
some
persons
and
some
just
their
reputation
as
we
might
say
hearsay.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
there
were
150
in
the
jury
roll
and
i
believe
they
were
--
they
were
just
a
name
for
taken
out
by
the
jury.
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
i
--
i
am
--
i
must
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
approximately
150.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir,
because
that
the
--
there
was
a
jury
roll
of
approximately
1800
and
just
--
so
they
were
--
the
names
were
picked
out.
they
were
--
the
--
there
were
no
five
negroes
picked
out.
it
was
just
five
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
as
mr.
depke
said
there
were
approximately
150
and
colored
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
--percentage,
i
believe.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
the
discretion
is
that
when
the
jury
commission
goes
out
into
the
district
and
they
ask
about
one
of
the
names
they
have,
say,
it's
john
jones
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
making
up
the
list
or
adding
to
the
list.
then
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
have
those
facts.
i
don't
believe
they
were
brought
out
at
the
trial.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
when
the
jury
commission
goes
out
to
interview
perspective
jurors,
if
--
if
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
i
--
i
just
said
in
the
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
teacher,
doctor
in
one
community,
sir.
if
they
say
well
that's
a
good
person,
he's
had
maybe
a
few
driving
offenses
or
--
or
perhaps
he
was
--
gets
drunk
occasionally,
which
is
possibility,
it
did.
and
that
happens
quite
seldom
and
otherwise,
he's
a
person
of
good
character
and
either
white
or
negro
that
they
could
put
him
in
the
service
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
in
a
roll.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
there
is.
mr.
david
w.
clark
nowhere
in
the
testimony
was
there
anything
brought
out
as
to
we
picked
on
--
on
this
jury,
five
negroes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
is
true,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
as
i
have
said,
the
only
way
i
could
is
that
the
jury
commission
only
put
on
a
--
a
certain
number
of
white
and
colored
names
with
those
that
they
interviewed
or
checked
into
and
it
--
suppose
in
this
case,
there
are
more
whites
than
colored.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
he
goes
out
with
the
names
already
and
--
and
checks
his
names
out.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
i
believe
this
court
has
held
its
burden
is
on
the
petitioner
and
instance
like
that
the
defendant
to
--
to
show
there
has
been
some
discrimination.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir,
we
don't
(inaudible)
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
on
the
statutes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir,
there's
nothing
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
not
on
the
statute.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
i
will
point
out
that
while
the
attorney
general
could
do
that,
i
should
also
point
out
that
any
member
of
the
jury
commission
could
write
to
the
attorney
general
upon
opinion
of
how
he
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
think
in
the
light
of
the
juror
--
of
this
court
decision,
there
should
be
no
discrimination.
i
believe
you
have
frequently
held
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
the
exercise
in
the
legislation.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
yes,
sir,
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
mr.depke
in
his
testimony
as
to
his
immediate
precinct
pointed
out
that
there
were
seven
members
on
the
jury
roll
--
jurors,
four
were
negroes
and
three
were
whites.
that
was
in
his
own
precinct,
sir.
so
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
very
small
to
that
there
were
only
seven
jurors
in
there,
possibly
100
people
this
precinct
is.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
mean
they
were
seven
jurors.
there
were
four
negroes
and
three
whites.
mr.
david
w.
clark
martin
station
was
the
name
given
to
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
have
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
do
not
know
that,
sir,
but
based
on
the
county
population
that
if
we
go
along
the
1950
census,
it
would
be
about
half
and
half
of
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
martin
station?
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
assume
it's
approximate
that
sir,
but
i
do
not
know,
i
don't
have
any
(inaudible)
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
we
have.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
they
are.
mr.
david
w.
clark
approximately
three
counties
in
the
state.
mr.
david
w.
clark
approximately
three
counties.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
that
wasn't
brought
out
at
the
trial.
i
believe
those
counties
are
lowndes,
marengo
and
tuskegee.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
i
have
some.
now,
in
another
case,
it
was
cited
on
neal
versus
delaware,
we
definitely
have
the
statute
there
that
excluded
persons
that
have
been
dissent
from
jury
service,
but
of
course
that
ever
gone
this
face
was
--
this
different
from
this
one
that
we
have
here
and
another
one
cited
was
pierre
versus
louisiana.
and
this
was
one
where
there
were
approximately
one-half
the
population
was
negro.
and
that
no
negro
had
said
it
was
petit
or
grand
jury
in
the
last
10
years.
now,
in
anytime
on
the
grand
jury
and
they
had
300
names
in
the
venire
box,
three
of
these
were
negroes,
one
was
a
dead
person,
dead
negroes,
so
there
were
really
only
two
out
of
299,
and
they
held
this
was
discrimination.
well,
that
--
that's
a
long
way
from
the
case
we
have
before
the
court.
the
only
similarity
there
is
that
there
were
approximately
half
of
the
population
was
negro.
in
the
reese
versus
georgia,
another
case
cited,
we
--
that
was
a
due
process
matter
in
which
the
georgia
rule
of
practice
required
the
defendant
to
challenge
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
before
the
indictment,
where
the
grand
jury
was
empanelled,
sworn
in
eight
days
before
the
man
was
indicted
in
that
case
and
he
did
not
have
counsel
appointed
until
the
day
after
he
was
indicted.of
course,
that
was
due
process.
it
was
violated
there.
that's
nowhere
near
the
case
before
the
court.
shepherd
versus
florida,
we
had
discrimination
there.
negroes
were
discriminated
against
on
the
jury
system.
and
there
was
also
the
possible
race
rot
and
things
of
that
nature,
newspaper
writings
that
just
prevented
a
fair
trial
to
the
man
so
that
was
questioned
in.
smith
versus
texas
was
the
other
one
that
--
where
they
drew
a
grand
jury
in
which
they
put
the
first
way
of
names,
white
people
and
then
13,
14,
15,
16
were
of
the
negro
race
and
there
was
a
local
practice
to
pick
the
first
12.
and
that
was
just
a
stag
deck,
so
to
speak,
there.
of
course,
estrada
versus
west
virginia
is
the
one
that
said
that
all
white
male
through
21
years
and
a
citizen
of
this
states
shall
be
liable
to
serve
as
jurors
except
this
hearing
provided
and
they
provided
for
certain
state
officials.
of
course,
that
excluded
all
persons
of
negro
descent.
but
once
again,
that's
a
long
ways
from
the
case
we
have
before
the
court.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
(voice
overlap)
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
did
--
there
was
a
showing
that
in
1953,
october
1953,
the
box
was
pushed
of
all
means
and
then
a
new
disc
was
made
up.
mr.
david
w.
clark
completely
refilled.
that
was
the
time
that
1500
were
put
in.
now
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
there
had
been
additional
names
and
the
deletion
of
certain
names,
people
who
died
(inaudible).
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
record
didn't
show
of
any.
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
record
did
not
show
that
once
again.
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
defendant
did
not
ask
that
question.
i
did
not
endeavor
to
bring
that
out
in
any
fashion.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
stood
on
the
ground
that
there
were
1800
jurors.
there
were
only
approximately
150
negroes.
now,
the
petitioner
in
his
brief
on
page
14
says
that
petitioner
does
not
challenge
the
system
of
selecting
jurors
as
such
in
alabama.
he
points
that
out
on
himself.
in
fact,
he
points
out
several
things
in
the
--
it
just
is
undecided
of
what
he
had
based
in
his
claim
that
there
was
discrimination
at
the
trial.
it
was
pointed
out
and
the
court
asked
the
attorney
for
the
present
petition.
did
he
have
any
objection
to
the
way
the
jury
was
known
and
he
said,
"no,
except
for
the
names
--
discrepancy
that
the
pro
--
pro
rata
share
of
names
being
just
a
small
portion
of
negroes."
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir,
i
would
point
out
though
that
as
to
who
struck
and
who
stood
to
gain
by
the
striking
up
and
there
was
no
showing
that
had
these
two
negroes
been
left
on
the
jury
that
the
case
would
have
changed
one
way
or
the
other.
on
the
other
hand,
as
they
were
struck,
that's
the
reason
the
petitioners
up
here
claiming
there
was
discrimination.
so
if
there
was
anybody
to
profit
by
the
striking,
it
--
it
would
be
to
presume
that
it
was
the
petitioner.
he
had
two
chances
against
one
of
the
state
to
strike
him.
mr.
david
w.
clark
the
record
does
not
show.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it's
possible
that
they
did.
if
they
--
if
they
did,
then
they
created
their
own
petition
of
here,
the
ground
for
it.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
the
record
does
not
show.
i've
pointed
that
out
by
record
at
page
62.
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
sir.
i
don't
have
knowledge
of
such.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
were
not
in
this
case.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
so
they
--
they
could
have
it
if
they
want
to
present
it.
that's
another
thing
i
want
to
point
out
that
the
petitioner
could
have
brought
that
up
who
struck
them.
he
could
have
made
that
a
point
on
his
appeal.
he
did
not
choose
to
do
that.
he
did
not
choose
to
ask
for
the
jury
roll
to
be
brought
out
in
court,
to
show
if
there
were
at
the
last
minute
as
in
norris
versus
alabama,
some
names
handwritten
on
the
roll.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
could
have
been.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir
(voice
overlap).
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
one
or
two
more
recent
cases.
one
is
speller
versus
allen,
in
which
in
vance
county,
north
carolina,
there
were
145
names
out
of
a
total
of
2126
names
in
the
jury
box,
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
no
evidence
of
discrimination
in
that
case.
mr.
david
w.
clark
so
the
testimony
is
closed,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
they
could
have
been
--
go
stricken
on
the
petit
jury.
i
don't
know
who
did
that,
but
since
the
grand
jury,
it
was
never
changed
there.
that
is
our
contention.
now,
in
the
speller
versus
allen
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
they
had
incidentally
filled
that
--
refilled
that
jury
box.
and
this
court
held
that
--
that
past
acts
of
theirs
were
just
evidence
of
past
attitude
of
mind
and
it
should
not
govern
in
this
case,
as
they
had
now
made
a
diligent
effort
to
discharge
their
duties
properly
in
selecting
the
jury.
that
is
our
contention
here
that
the
prayers
of
jury
commission
is
making
a
diligent
effort
to
comply
with
the
law
and
therefore,
there
has
been
no
actual
evidence
of
discrimination
shown
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
the
burden
was
upon
him.
we
contend
he
failed
to
show
it
to
meet
that
burden.
there
was
evidence
presented
by
the
solicitor,
the
sheriff,
various
other
people
as
to
how
many
had
been
called
each
time
and
there
was
more
or
less
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
negroes
on
the
jury
roll.
we
contend
there
was
no
evidence
of
discrimination
shown
in
this
case
and
that
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
mr.
hall
informs
me,
yes,
sir.
