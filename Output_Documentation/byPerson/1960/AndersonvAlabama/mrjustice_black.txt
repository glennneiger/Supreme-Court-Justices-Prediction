mr.
mr.justice
black
what
was
meant
there
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
in
that
--
that
particular
moment
with
reference
to
this
venire?
mr.
mr.justice
black
well,
what
is
that?
mr.
mr.justice
black
all
the
jurors
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
summoned
for
the
week?
mr.
mr.justice
black
all
who
had
been
summoned
and
qualified
or
had
they
been
qualified
at
that
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
only
what?
mr.
mr.justice
black
i
mean
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
68.
mr.
mr.justice
black
now,
when
the
time
came
to
strike,
was
there
right
given
to
strike
from
the
entire
68
or
was
there
a
certain
group
brought
into
the
courtroom?
mr.
mr.justice
black
from
the
entire
venire?
mr.
mr.justice
black
i
asked
that
because
it
used
to
be
the
practice
in
some
of
the
counties
that
you
would
call
for
a
certain
number
of
jurors
out
of
the
entire
venire.
mr.
mr.justice
black
they
would
be
called
into
the
courtroom
and
would
strike
from
that
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
number
which
was
left
in
the
total
venire.
mr.
mr.justice
black
this
case?
mr.
mr.justice
black
the
whole
68?
mr.
mr.justice
black
passed
the
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
passed
the
question
and
they
granted
certain
excuses.
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
then
they
were
allowed
to
strike.
mr.
mr.justice
black
plaintiff
getting
one
and
the
defendant,
two.
mr.
mr.justice
black
you
strike
it
this
way,
do
you
not?as
you
left,
you
have
paid
them,
55
left
after
they
excuse
them.
mr.
mr.justice
black
the
one
whose
name
appears
at
the
top
of
the
list
is
called
around
and
they
stated
there,
should
they
take
him
and
the
defendant
is
asked
if
he
takes
him.
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
that's
the
way
you
strike
it
and
you
may
get
a
juror
without
exhausting
your
entire
venire
at
all.
mr.
mr.justice
black
the
clerk
picks
up,
prepares
that
list,
does
it
not?
mr.
mr.justice
black
puts
them
in
a
certain
order.
mr.
mr.justice
black
we
had
a
case
called
one
time
somewhere
where
the
question
was
whether
certain
names
had
been
put
at
the
bottom
purposely
so
that
it'd
be
difficult
to
reach.
and
there's
no
question
i
can't
raise.
mr.
mr.justice
black
you
mean
they're
drawn
before
--
they're
just
drawn
out
of
the
box
and
then
that
--
these
that
are
drawn
are
summoned.
is
that
correct?
mr.
mr.justice
black
it
may
be
done
a
week
or
two
weeks
before
they
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
their
term.
they're
drawn
by
the
judge
--
they
are
drawn
by
the
judge
still
in
the
courtroom,
are
they?
mr.
mr.justice
black
open
court.
and
then
they
--
they
give
--
turned
over
to
the
sheriff
and
the
order
of
clerk,
in
the
order
in
which
they
are
drawn,
he
draws
up
a
list
and
they
have
summoned.
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
does
the
law
require
him
to
follow
the
--
that
same
order
when
he
makes
up
his
list
from
those
who
were
found?
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
you
point
to
anything
in
the
record
which
would
neutralize
or
offset
or
refuse
the
statement
whether
it
was
a
guess,
an
informed
guess
or
what
it
was
that
was
made
of
that
they're
being
1
in
12.
mr.
mr.justice
black
but
we
were
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
we
should
assume
i
suppose
that
--
that
we're
not
the
fact,
the
state
and
its
officials,
would
have
accident,
would
we
not?
mr.
mr.justice
black
is
there
anyway
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
the
gentleman
who
testified
here,
what
position?
mr.
mr.justice
black
is
it
his
duty
to
keep
informed
as
to
what
names
are
there
and
who's
there?
is
it
--
is
that
a
part
of
his
responsibility?
mr.
mr.justice
black
did
he
even
keep
the
accurate
names
with
its
--
it's
the
duty
of
the
jury
commission
isn't
it
to
give
the
name
finally
and
select
to
find
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
i
would
assume
that
in
dallas
county,
the
jury
commissioner
would
have
a
pretty
good
knowledge
or
we
can
assume
he
can
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
whether
they
were
white
or
colored.
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
how
can
--
how
can
we
decide
this
case
on
any
basis
except
that
this
uncontradicted
statement
of
his
is
correct
whether
--
whatever
result
it
leads
to
is
different.
mr.
mr.justice
black
well,
i
--
i
suppose
there's
nobody
and
maybe
not
even
the
clerk
perhaps
who
should
be
and
better
informed
on
that
than
the
jury
commissioner
is
he?
mr.
mr.justice
black
of
course
that's
their
sole
responsibility,
isn't
it?
mr.
mr.justice
black
they
have
no
other
jobs,
are
these
men,
do
they
hold
any
other
public
job
in
dallas
county?
mr.
mr.justice
black
that's
that
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
may
i
ask
you
just
a
few
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
statistics,
of
course
you
realize
whatever
these
cases
say
as
you've
said,
we've
got
to
consider
this
case
somewhat
on
those
facts.
mr.
mr.justice
black
that
is
--
that's
--
that's
correct.
what
is
the
--
the
total
voting
population
of
dallas
county
now?
do
you
know?
mr.
mr.justice
black
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
mr.justice
black
what
is
the
total
--
you
wouldn't
know
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
what
is
the
--
what
are
the
literacy
figures
in
dallas
county
now,
with
reference
to
those
over
21,
do
you
know?
mr.
mr.justice
black
you
have
schools
for
both,
there
now?
mr.
mr.justice
black
scattered
pretty
well
over
the
county?
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
you
still
have
compulsory
education
for
both
groups?
mr.
mr.justice
black
which
is
--
which
is
the
law
in
dallas
county.
mr.
mr.justice
black
is
this
--
do
you
know
how
the
illiterates
of
that
compares
in
dallas
as
to
both
races
were
the
literacy
or
illiteracy
in
the
other
counties
in
the
state.
mr.
mr.justice
black
the
literacy?
mr.
mr.justice
black
is
that
it?
is
there
any
difference
in
the
number
so
appreciable
difference,
total
illiteracy.
that
is
that
people
can't
read
and
write.
do
you
have
that
between
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
well,
that's
not
a
notice
--
i
--
i
wouldn't
think
that's
a
noticeable
percentages
of
people
in
dallas
now,
who
couldn't
read
or
write.
mr.
mr.justice
black
may
i
ask
you
now
with
reference
to
this.
what
i'm
sure
you
have
realized
is
the
crucial
point
in
the
case
to
justice
harlan.
assuming
that
it
is
correct
that
the
percentage
has
dropped
from
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
from
1
in
5
to
1
in
12,
is
there
any
reasonable
explanation
that
could
be
made
on
that
from
the
record?
mr.
mr.justice
black
there's
certainly
no
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
no
less
literacy
among
the
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
one
group,
the
colored
group
that
they
were
on,
is
any
reason
to
assume
that
not
just
as
many
or
more
people
of
good
character
and
reputation
than
they
were
before?
mr.
mr.justice
black
but
i
have
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
that
is
correct.
but
i
was
asking
on
the
--
with
the
idea
that
you
had
not
only
the
state
law
but
you
have
the
federal
law,
which
says
there
must
be
no
discrimination
on
account
of
color.
mr.
mr.justice
black
and
what
--
what
reason
can
you
think
of
except
color
to
account
for
this
decided
drop
in
the
--
percentages
realizing
of
course,
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
special
percentage.
mr.
mr.justice
black
what
reason
can
you
advance
in
the
practice
in
alabama
or
what
has
occurred
reference
to
filling
the
boxes
or
anything
else,
it
could
be
responsible
for
that,
except
color.
mr.
mr.justice
black
what
precinct
was
that?
mr.
mr.justice
black
what's
the
division
of
population
to
that
precinct?
mr.
mr.justice
black
three
whites
and
blacks.
mr.
mr.justice
black
what,
in
that
precinct?
i'm
talking
about
that
precinct?
mr.
mr.justice
black
yes.
mr.
mr.justice
black
pardon
me?
mr.
mr.justice
black
three
counties.
have
we
got
any
data
in
this
record
or
any
judicial
notice
or
statistical
census
reports
as
to
what
the
situation
is
in
those
counties?
mr.
mr.justice
black
you
have
precinct
in
dallas
county,
do
you
not,
where
the
same
kind
of
disproportion
exist
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
i'd
like
to
ask
one
more
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
just
to
get
it
clear,
i
hate
to
ask
you
so
many
questions.
mr.
mr.justice
black
does
the
record
show
whether
the
box
has
been
emptied
(inaudible)
in
anyway
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--up
to
the
time
when
there
were
a
bigger
percentage
of
colored
people.
mr.
mr.justice
black
completely
refilled.
mr.
mr.justice
black
now
--
now,
after
what
i'm
getting
at
is,
what
does
it
show
has
happened
since
then
with
reference
to
the
box?
had
there
been
supplements
to
put
in?
mr.
mr.justice
black
well,
has
there
--
had
there
been
one
or
two
times
when
they
put
in
a
large
number
according
to
the
record?
mr.
mr.justice
black
has
there
been
one
or
two
times
whether
--
when
they
took
out
a
large
number
according
to
the
record?
mr.
mr.justice
black
it
doesn't
show
it
either
way?
mr.
mr.justice
black
they
stood
on
the
results
rather
than
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
well,
are
you
arguing
that
they
struck
him?
i
don't
know
that
that
have
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
i
would
suppose
mr.
mr.justice
black
there'd
be
no
difficulty
to
find
out
where
difficult
--
everybody
knows
who
struck
the
--
find
out
in
five
minutes.
mr.
mr.justice
black
that
still,
the
court
was
not
answering
the
charge
that
they
have
made.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
relevant.
what
they're
saying
is
that
regardless
of
the
fact
he
did
--
that
normally
you
had
it
on
--
mr.
mr.justice
black
--
shows
in
itself
that
couldn't
have
been,
using
justice
frankfurter's
statements,
of
pure
chance.
mr.
mr.justice
black
i'd
say
that
--
that's
the
argument.
mr.
mr.justice
black
may
i
ask
you
if
this
evidence
shows
how
that
one
was
selected,
what
kind
of
case
was
up
that
week?
mr.
mr.justice
black
when
it
occurred
--
when
did
it
occur?
mr.
mr.justice
black
did
it
occur
at
anytime
in
connection
with
the
opinions
that
were
handed
down
or
does
the
record
show?
mr.
mr.justice
black
well
--
do
you
mean
they
have
an
information
for
felony?
