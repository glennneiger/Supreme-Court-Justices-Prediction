mr.
greenberg,
i
--

like
to

clear
in
my
mind,
i'm
confused

justice

e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice

e.

whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
mean
they
are
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
sir?
once
a
name
gets
in
that
what
i
call
a
wheel
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that's
what
it
was
in
the
jurisdiction
i
practiced.
how
did
it
ever
get
out
of
there?
i
mean
of
course,
i
know
you
draw
them
but
aren't
to
put
back
after
they
asserted?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
certain
number
of
whites
and
certain
number
of
negroes
in
originally,
unless
they
died,
how
do
they
get
out?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
would
one
tell?
if
i
went
down
there
today
and
look
at
those
cards,
how
would
i
tell
how
many
were
white
and
how
many
were
negroes?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
was
there
any
other
identification,
any
other
record,
showing?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
a
juror
who
--
whose
name
is
in
this
wheel,
moves
away,
how
does
the
jury
commissioners
know
about
that
or
assume
they
find
out
in
some
way,
do
they
then
go
and
take
his
name
out
of
the
wheel?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
they
do.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
know
if
whether
or
not,
there
was
any
practice
in
that
section
of
the
state
where
negro
defendants
not
to
want,
but
to
strike
negro
jurors
in
criminal
cases.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
your
examination
is
ordinarily
not
transcribed?
