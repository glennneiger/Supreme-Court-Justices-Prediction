to
--
of
this
list
done
in
--
by
lot
in
public,
in
the
trial
or
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
done
in
the
courtroom.

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead.

take
your
time
for
that.
chief
justice
earl

if
they
had
--
if
they
had
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
have
told
how
many
negroes
and
how
many
whites
were
from

from
the
names
--
chief
justice
earl

wouldn't
be
--
wouldn't
do
much
good
on
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
literacy
test
for
jurors
in
that
county?
chief
justice
earl

yes.
so
there
is
no

earl
warren
everybody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
unless
they
are
free
holders
or
householders.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
event,
they
do
not
have
to
be
--
they
do
not
have
to
follow
any
literacy
test.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
now,
i
was
wondering
--
i'm
wondering
this.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
these
other
cases
that
you
have
been
talking
about,
if
they
have
the
same
requirements
for
--
for
drawing
up
the
--
the
jury
panel
that
you
have
here,
as
i
--
as
i
read
it,
the
jury
commission
shall
make
in
a
well
bound
book
roll
containing
the
name
of
every
male
citizen
living
in
the
county
who
possessed
the
qualifications
herein
described.
the
jury
commission
shall
place
on
the
jury
roll
and
in
the
jury
box
the
names
of
all
male
citizens
of
the
county
who
are
generally
refuted
to
be
honest
and
intelligent
and
are
esteemed
in
the
community
for
their
integrity,
good
character
and
sound
judgment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
as
i
understand
it,
they
--
the
jury
commissioner
only
found
1800
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
this
county
who
had
fulfilled
that
requirement,
both
white
and
black.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
is
under
the
law,
required
to
put
all
of
them
in
there
who
have
that
character.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
does
not
require.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
also
have
in
this
case,
do
we
not,
that
since
a
new
system
came
in,
in
1953,
with
the
county
almost
evenly
divided
between
negroes
and
--
and
whites,
that
there
never
had
been
anyone
sit
on
the
petit
jury
and
only
one
person
that
ever
--
no
one
--
never
had
been
a
colored
person
who
had
sat
on
a
trial
jury
and
only
one
who
had
sat
on
the
grand
jury?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
