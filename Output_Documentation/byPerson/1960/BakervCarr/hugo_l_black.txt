justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
to
distinguish
it
on
the
ground
that
there're
only
three
members
of
the
court
that
have
read
the
--
that
idea.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
four
members
thought
there
was
jurisdiction,
but
one
of
the
four
thought
that
it
should
--
relief
should
not
be
granted
on
equitable
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
do
we
have
to
anticipate
what
steps
that
would
take
it
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
believe
you
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
haven't
been
so
held
in
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
hadn't
been
so
(voice
overlap)
--
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
find
out
that,
i
thought
in
the
broom
case
that
they
gave
some
kind
of
relief
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
relief
there
that
you
said
could
be
granted?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
-–
what
was
the
argument
about
the
electing
from
the
state
at
large
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
with
reference
to
your
suggestion
to
this
point
that
might
occur,
we
merely
hold
that
this
–
we
whether
hold
that
jurisdiction
would
stop
there,
without
saying
that
there
was
enough
stated
that
is
required
trial.
next
thing
would
be
that
it
would
be
right
back
up,
on
the
basis
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
failed
to
state
the
cause
of
action.
do
i
understand
that
is
your
suggestion
that
we
stop
short
of
holding
that
this
--
there's
enough
alleged
in
here
to
justify
relief
if
–-
if
the
facts
are
established
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
we
hold
the
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
--
there'd
still
be
the
question
of
the
--
whether
it
stated
a
cause
of
action,
the
two
things
are
different,
jurisdiction
in
the
stating
cause
of
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
did
--
if
we
didn't,
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
was
dismissed
on
that
ground,
it
has
to
come
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
whichever
way
it
went
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
whichever
way
it
went,
because
if
they
held
it
stated
the
cause
of
action
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
had
a
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
would
hold
it,
done
straight
the
cause
of
action,
which
seems
to
be
the
claim
of
the
plaintiffs
here,
then
it
would
be
dismissed
and
come
right
back.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
be
the
fifth
city,(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
right
in
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
right
in
thinking,
if
you're
asking
us
to
reconsider
those
cases
whatever
they
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
tennessee
supreme
court
directly
held
either
that
this
apportionment
is
in
accordance
with
its
constitution
or
that
it's
against
its
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
am
i
--
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
your
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
the
constitution
requires
this
would
be
done
in
your
way
and
that
that
therefore
denies
equal
protection
of
the
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
the
principle
that
they
have
a
law
of
tennessee.
it
does
not
--
which
does
require
what
you
(inaudible)
and
it's
being
enforced
with
a
discriminatory
eye
or
an
invidious
eye
so
that
it
become
necessary
for
them
to
apply
the
law
equally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
you
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
not
decided
one
way
or
the
other
on
that
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
a
case
on
tennessee
where
they
had
a
tax
law,
state
tax
law.
and
it
was
written
one
way
in
the
book
and
enforced
another.
we
held
that
since
they
were
doing
it
discriminatorily
as
i
recalled
it,
did
that
deny
the
equal
protection
of
the
law?
i
have
read
very
greatly
but
my
recollection
is
that
--
substance
to
what
we
held.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
brought
it
by
custom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
dictation
from
the
law
as
construed
and
applied
through
the
years.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
here
that
there
had
been
no
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
that
the
custom
is
not
sufficient
to
bring
it
within
the
ruling
of
the
browning
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
within
the
slaughter-house
case.
a
statement
was
made
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
the
time
it
was
passed
probably
not
so
to
include
--
to
protect
anybody
with
color
(inaudible)
has
it
been
limited
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
construing
the
question
i
asked
you
a
moment
ago
just
going
a
point
further.
as
i
understand
it,
do
you
say
that
there
has
been
no
ruling
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
what
is
done
here
is
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
provision
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
do
you
say
that
they
refused
to
decide
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
refuse
to
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
they
have
refused
to
decide
this
question,
this
constitutional
question
that
it
is
a
meritorious
question,
why
would
it
not
come
up
on
the
question
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
under
the
doctrine
of
mooney
against
holohan?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
have
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
cases
in
that
court
in
that
field
from
this
court
indicating
that
the
probability
was
it
was
some
kind
of
a
political
matter
of
which
courts
could
have
no
possible
jurisdiction?
was
that
in
the
browning
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
you
could
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
probably
have
associates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
attorney
general
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
let's
assume
the
legislature
has
divided
squarely
in
its
law,
the
votes,
people
living
in
rural
communities
are
here
and
set
out
defining
geographical
area
as
rural
community
shall
be
counted
in
each
election
ten
times
while
the
--
while
they're
counted
once
in
the
city.
did
you
say
that
would
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
say
that
the
irrational
classification?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
let's
assume,
however,
that
you're
taking
a
position
there
that
i
took
in
the
case
about
the
constitutional
amendment
as
to
the
power
of
the
congress
to
declare
that
amendment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
therefore,
you're
saying
that
it's
not
a
justiciable
matter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
let's
assume
that
you
were
overruled
on
that.
let's
just
assume
that
and
if
were
held
to
be
a
justiciable
matter
and
the
act
were
written
in
the
form
that
i've
stated,
would
you
say
that
that
should
be
supported
as
a
rational
classification
to
discrim
--
to
distinguish
between
the
voters
and
the
rural
community
and
in
the
city?
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
there's
room
for
argument
on
both
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
room
for
argument
on
both
sides.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it
justiciable,
why
is
that
basic,
and
we
should
not
refrain
by
passing
on
it,
but
should
pass
on,
why
is
not
that
substantially
the
issue,
the
question
that
we
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
assuming
now
that
they
have
standings,
they
have
a
right
to
bring
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
mine
was
--
my
question
was
intended
to
state
the
specifics
there
that
the
county
that
you're
talking
where
you
say
it,
and
six
other
counties
are
the
rural
counties
who
have
that
votes
counted
in
all
elections
so
as
to
each
vote
overcome
five
votes
to
get
and
shall
be
added
in
shelby,
tennessee,
shelby
county,
tennessee.
that
would
be
a
very
clear
standard,
but
the
question
challenged
--
it
was
challenged
then
on
the
basis
that
it
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law.
it
was
not
a
reasonable
classification
under
that
amendment.
what
would
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
that
plenty
of
arguments
about
that.
but
let's
assume,
maybe
the
court
will
decide
later
on
the
other
question.
let's
assume
that
all
procedural
hurdles
and
political
hurdles
and
restraint
hurdles
have
been
old
town
and
straight,
square
question
before
as
to
whether
the
law
down
there
now
that
i
see
who
protection
of
the
law.
what
is
the
difference
between
it
supplies
classification
is
concerned
and
the
one
which
i
have
just
stated
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
asking
--
what
i'm
asking
is
assuming
that
we
get
to
the
merits
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
of
the
controversies
to
whether
giving
the
votes
in
certain
locality,
geographical
locality,
more
value
in
all
the
election
than
the
votes
in
ceratin
other
locality,
the
rural
community
over
the
city.
would
that
be
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
if
they
were
given
the
value
of
six
to
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
lot
of
them
were
not
satisfied
with
that
when
the
constitution
was
adopted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
adopted
that
way
clearly
and
specifically.
here,
we
have
a
general
term
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
about
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
classification
under
that
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
you
why
is
that
argument
is
valuable?
we
would
have
the
right
to
try
any
cases
through
a
man
who
says
he'd
been
deprived
of
voting
on
the
basis
of
his
race?
and
it's
true
there's
a
specific
amendment
which
requires
that
but
they
claim
the
amendment
here
protects
them
against
this
kind
of
discrimination.
i
just
don't
quite
understand
your
argument
since
there
is
no
standing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
say
it
does
have
control
over
their
apportionment
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
justice
has
it
--
justice
has
control
over
the
law
with
reference
to
voting
so
far
as
racism.
i
do
not
understand.
its
opinions
subject
to
the
grave,
in
fact
man
cannot
claim.
it's
a
discriminate
against
in
voting
because
it's
not
based
on
the
color,
that
maybe
the
claim
is
unsound.
i
can
understand
that
argument
but
i
do
not
understand
the
other
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
different
religion,
what's
about
(inaudible)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
said
supposed
it
was,
whether
you
have
outstanding
duration
if
you'd
been
discriminate
--
somebody
had
been
discriminated
against
some
kind
of
religion
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
color?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
supposed
justice
hugo
l.
black
--legislation
has
been
written
in
certain
way
that
will
guarantee
by
reason
of
the
population,
it
wasn't
a
case
done
in
(inaudible).
in
certain
group,
either
they
call
it
their
religion
or
call
it
with
their
color,
would
not
be
properly
represented.
would
you
say
then
it
couldn't
be
raised?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
counties
in
tennessee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
would
you
classify
as
urban
in
the
general
acceptation
of
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
about
90
to
1?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
how
many
members
of
the
legislature
come
from
five
urban
counties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
--
what
i
asked
you
the
question
for
was
to
find
out
whether
there
was
any
real
genuine
chance
after
what
you've
said
about
the
legislature
columnist,
whether
there
was
any
real
genuine
chance
to
vote
down
probably
to
85
counties
by
five
counties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
a
little
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
such
a
rule
(inaudible)
de
facto
official
bodies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
the
number
of
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
roughly
had
the
counties
or
have
the
voters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
it?
which
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one?
as
i
understood
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
half
the
counties
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
are
urban
counties.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
imagine
any
case
where
we
hold
a
law
unconstitutional
whether
they
decide
its
settlement
against
what
we
hold
in
the
community
as
the
legislature
wouldn't
try
to
pass
another
and
(inaudible)
as
much
as
possible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
(inaudible)
the
reason
why
we
shouldn't
hold
them
unconstitutional
if
they
are?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
to
get
your
view
on
one
thing
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
adversary
says
that
the
legislature
couldn't
meet.
he
said
that
it
was
illegal,
it
couldn't
meet
and
that
you
couldn't
elect
a
new
legislature
because
if
--
if
only
apportionment
lawyer
have
is
what
you
have.
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
get
a
constitutional
legislature
under
his
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
legislative
body
is
unconstitutional.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
you're
invoking
the
de
facto
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
