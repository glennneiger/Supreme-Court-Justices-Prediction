mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
appears
in
this
case
as
amicus
curiae
partly
because
it
involves
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
large
number
of
citizens,
both
in
tennessee
and
elsewhere,
but
also
because
it
raises
issues
that
lie
very
close
to
the
heart
--
our
system
of
government.
it
involves
not
only
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process,
but
also
of
course,
a
difficult
and
delicate
question
concerning
the
proper
role
of
the
judiciary
in
securing
voters'
fair
representation
in
their
state
legislature.
i
shall
devote
my
argument
to
three
propositions.
the
first
is
that
the
complaint
alleges
a
deprivation
of
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
right
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
discrimination
in
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
which
is
sufficiently
personal
to
give
the
victims
of
the
discrimination
standing
to
sue.
under
the
general
jurisdictional
statutes
of
course,
the
federal
courts
do
have
a
right
to
hear
cases,
to
remedy
alleged
depravations
of
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
second
proposition
is
that
a
complaint
alleging
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
through
malapportoinment
presents
a
justiciable
controversy.
in
the
sense
that
the
courts
do
have
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
to
hear
the
case,
adjudicate
its
merits
and
grant
equitable
relief
under
appropriate
circumstances
also
under
other
circumstances,
they
might
in
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
an
equity
court,
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
useful
relief
which
the
court
could
administer.
our
third
proposition
is
that
at
this
stage
of
the
case,
there
is
at
least
enough
likelihood
that
the
court
below
sitting
as
court
of
equity,
could
find
some
administrable
form
of
relief
to
make
it
improper,
to
dismiss
the
complaint
at
the
very
outset
before
the
facts
had
been
fully
with
the
appellant.
it
seems
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that's
about
to
this
extent.
the
court
below
--
of
course,
the
court
below
had
jurisdiction.
if
the
complaint
states
a
claim
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
whether
the
complaint
is
well
founded
or
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
at
least
if
it's
not
patently
frivolous.
we
think
the
point
is
involved
at
least
to
the
extent
that
we
should
show
that
this
isn't
a
feudal
suing
client,
but
it
does
not
seem
necessary
or
indeed,
not
even
appropriate
for
the
court
to
rule
now,
whether
there
has
or
has
not
been
a
violation
to
fourteenth
amendment.
if
it
decides
that
there
is
a
substantial
claim
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
then
there
was
jurisdiction
and
there
ought
to
be
a
ruling
by
the
lower
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
has
to
be
an
allegation
that
they
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
alleged
a
violation,
but
not
a
determination
that
what
they
alleged
is
a
violation,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way.
in
other
words,
the
--
the
question
whether
this
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action
is
different
from
the
question
whether
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
this
--
this
was
the
first
case
i
think
of
is
an
opinion
of
justice
holmes
in
hart
against
keith
vaudeville
exchange,
where
he
does
say,
“if
you
state
a
claim
even
if
it's
not
well-founded
of
federal
right,
the
court
has
jurisdiction
at
least
where
the
claim
isn't
patently
frivolous.”
now,
i
do
propose
to
show
that
the
--
to
argue
that
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
not
patently
frivolous
and
of
course,
in
doing
that,
i
shall
be
in
effect,
directed
myself
to
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
prima
facie
violation.
mr.
archibald
cox
so,
it
comes
to
the
same
thing.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
must
exercise
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
all
you
need
hold
is
that
the
case
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
that
the
court
below
must
go
on
and
determine
whether
this
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action.
and
in
other
words,
adjudicate
the
merits
of
the
claim
that
is
a
violation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
let
me
--
let
me
perhaps
by
using
an
example,
i
can
make
a
little
clear
the
point
that
i
have
in
mind.
let
us
suppose
that
the
apportionment
in
vermont
were
such
that
it
was
in
proportion
to
population,
except
that
every
town,
they
have
the
new
england
system
of
town
government,
was
entitled
to
at
least
one
representative,
because
of
the
present
distribution
of
population,
that
that
would
not
result
in
an
equitable
--
it
would
not
result
in
an
--
representation
in
ratio
to
the
population.
such
an
--
an
allegation
that
this
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court,
but
it
might
well
be
held
when
one
got
to
the
merits
on
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
didn't
require
an
absolutely
equal
apportionment
of
seats
and
that
there,
although
the
complaint
was
within
the
court's
jurisdiction,
each
shouldn't
be
dismissed
on
the
merit.
now,
as
i
said
to
justice
stewart,
i
do
want
to
repeat
that
i
am
arguing
here
of
course
that
this
isn't
a
frivolous
complaint
and
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
necessarily
that
there
is
on
the
face
of
the
complaint,
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
think
it's
quite
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thought
the
court
did
rest
on
two
grounds
which
it
didn't
clearly
distinguish.
one,
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
two
that
even
if
there
was
federal
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
case
for
the
exercise
of
powers
of
the
court
of
equity.
here
again
[laughs]
i
have
another
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
they
were
together
and
yet
if
i
might
refer
that
for
a
moment
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
i
think
that
the
difference
does
go
to
the
heart
of
this
case.
i
was
about
to
develop
my
part
that
the
complaint
does
sufficiently
allege
a
deprivation
of
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
under
color
of
state
law
to
bring
the
case
within
the
general
jurisdictional
statute.
the
right
to
be
free
from
hostile
or
capricious
discrimination
by
a
state
in
defining
the
class
of
people
entitled
to
vote
or
in
the
exercise
of
the
franchise,
is
a
federal
right
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
also
a
right
enforceable
by
the
courts.
both
points
have
been
adjudicated
on
many
occasions,
in
cases
such
as
nixon
and
herndon,
the
texas
jaybird
case
and
others
of
that
type.
the
closest
precedents
do
involve
racial
discrimination,
but
i
suggest
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
prescribes
other
arbitrary
and
capricious
distinctions
affecting
the
right
to
vote.
certainly,
a
statute
that
said
that
redheaded
women
should
not
be
permitted
to
vote
or
that
no
one
who
had
ever
visited
the
british
commonwealth
should
permitted
to
vote,
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
i
take
it,
we
would
also
agree
with
the
illustration
that
mr.
justice
black
has
used
in
dissenting
opinions
that
if
a
statute
give
the
voters
in
the
west
half
of
the
state,
25
votes
and
the
voters
in
the
east
half
of
the
state,
only
one
vote,
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
where
the
apportionment
statute
has
the
same
effect
as
allowing
the
voters
in
the
sparsely
settled
west
half
to
elect
five
representatives
for
everyone
that
the
populous
county
in
the
east
half
can
elect.
thereto,
it
would
seem,
the
result
is
the
same
and
that
there
must
equally
be
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
were
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
a
--
a
question
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
be
presented.
i
am
not
suggesting,
clearly
not
suggesting
--
intending
to
suggest
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
the
apportionment
of
representatives
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature,
in
the
ratio
to
the
population.
it's
quite
plain
to
mean
that
that
is
not
the
fourteenth
amendment
requirement.
our
history
makes
it
plain
that
other
considerations,
geographical
distribution,
historic
association
of
political
subdivisions
and
things
of
that
kind,
may
be
taken
into
consideration.
certainly
in
one
house
and
i
would
assume
for
present
purposes,
maybe
taken
into
account
in
both
houses.
the
point
that
i
do
insist
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
doesn't
have
to
have
two.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
agree
it
doesn't
have
to
have
two
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
would
assume
for
present
purposes
that
there's
only
one,
that
there
did
not
have
to
be
an
exactly
mathematical
apportionment
in
terms
of
the
population.
what
i
do
insist
on,
is
that
the
state
must
have
some
rational
basis
for
its
apportionment.
and
i
think
that
the
case
we
have
here
is
one
where
it
appears
at
least
that
the
states
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
apportionment.
the
tennessee
constitution
requires
apportionment
in
the
ratio
to
the
population,
in
both
houses
of
the
legislature.
the
apportionment
is
so
--
the
ratio
is
so
out
of
proportion
today
that
a
vote
in
some
counties
is
worth
20
times
a
vote
in
other
counties.
now,
i
say
that
where
the
apportionment
that
the
state
has
departs
from
the
only
ostensible
basis
on
which
the
apportionment
is
based,
by
that
degree
--
that
this
is
such
an
egregious
error
that
it
stands
on
the
face
of
it
as
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
no.
i
don't
think
i
even
have
to
go
quite
that
far.
i
think
if
tennessee
came
in
at
the
trial
on
the
merits
of
this
case
and
show
to
some
other
rational
foundation
for
what
it
is
done,
that
then
the
complaint
--
i
don't
like
as
a
--
amicus
to
talk
my
friend
on
the
court,
[laughs]
but
at
least
my
argument
would
be
consistent
with
dismissing
the
complaint
at
that
stage.
all
i
say
is
that
where
you
have
an
ostensible
basis
and
what
you
do
comes
up
with
no
resemblance
to
it
that
that
at
least,
puts
the
burden
on
you
of
coming
forward
with
an
explanation.
now,
let
me
make
it
plain
that
this
is
not
a
claim
that
there
is
a
federal
right
to
have
tennessee
follow
the
tennessee
constitution.
the
only
federal
right
that
i'm
speaking
to
is
the
right
to
have
some
rational
basis
for
the
apportionment
and
we
say
at
this
stage,
that
on
the
face
of
it,
this
is
so
egregious,
crazy.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
face
of
what
we
have
in
front
of
this
at
this
stage
is
i
think
what
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
except
that
--
it
would
seem
to
me
that
here
tennessee,
at
least
i
had
urged
on
your
honor
that
the
ostensible
basis
was
following
the
tennessee
constitution.
tennessee
has
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
regret
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
i
would
surmise
that
there
must
have
been
some
other
rational
basis.
it
was
pointed
out
in
argument
to
this
court
for
the
tax
classification
and
so
here,
if
some
other
rational
basis
is
pointed
out
at
some
stage
of
the
case,
that
would
present
a
different
issue,
then
i
say
the
court
has
behind
it
--
before
it.
at
this
stage,
whether
they're
simply
considering,
whether
this
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
gave
--
well,
i
would
argue
that
one
could
infer
from
that,
but
this
hadn't
been
done
rationally.
that's
what
it
was
it
boils
down
to
where
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
perhaps
where
it's
entirely
irrational,
it
–-
the
results
don't
conform
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
hadn't
sought
to
distinguish
between
due
process
and
equal
protection.
that
would
seem
to
me
the
requirement
of
a
rational
basis
for
the
discrimination,
goes
to
the
equal
protection
clause
and
if
there
is
a
bad
enough
lack
of
rationality,
then
as
i
understand
it,
it
goes
to
due
process
too.
the
complaint
makes
claims
under
both
clauses.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
under
equal
–
i
didn't
intend
to
–
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
a
reasonable
classification.
and
i
suppose
that
means
when
it
has
something
rational
behind
it.
and
i
was
seeking
to
argue
that
here,
on
the
basis
of
what
we
have,
there
is
a
not
frivolous
claim,
that
this
classification
running
against
the
voters
in
the
under
represented
county
is
not
a
rational
classification.
i
would
think
it
was
also
bad
enough
to
violate
the
due
process
clause.
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
between
mr.
rhyne
and
myself
on
that
point.
i'd
like
to
go
on
now
to
consider
the
justiciably
--
justiciability
of
this
claim
of
unconstitutional
apportionment.
and
to
begin
by
drawing
the
distinction
to
which
i
adverted
in
a
discussion
with
the
chief
justice
a
moment
ago.
the
distinction
seems
to
me
to
be
exemplified
by
the
difference
between
the
opinions
of
justice
frankfurter
and
justice
rutledge
in
the
case
of
colegrove
and
green.
it's
one
thing
i
think,
to
hold
that
the
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
claims
of
malapportionment.
meaning,
that
there
is
no
power
to
deal
with
the
subject
matter,
because
it
–
because
it
presents
a
nonjusticiable
political
question.
and
it's
quite
another
to
hold
that
there
is
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
that
the
court
has
the
right
to
adjudicate
merits
and
then
to
go
on
and
consider
whether
this
case
is
one
in
which
it
can
appropriately
frame
a
relief,
and
then
to
decide
as
it
goes
through
the
case,
at
any
appropriate
state
of
whether
equity
should
act
or
whether
equity
should
decline
the
act.
now,
this
is
something
quite
familiar
in
private
law
and
it
was
imported
by
justice
rutledge's
opinion
following
an
earlier
concurring
opinion
in
wood
and
broom
into
the
law
--
into
the
law
of
this
court
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
case.
there
are,
i
think,
two
very
important
differences
between
the
two
approaches.
a
denial
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
would
exclude
all
malapportionment
cases
from
judicial
consideration
as
category,
without
regard
to
the
seriousness
of
the
constitutional
wrong,
without
regard
to
the
ability
of
the
court
to
grant
relief
or
indeed
necessarily
without
regard
to
any
other
considerations.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
has
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
they
followed
justice
rutledge's
analysis,
then
of
course
it
may
examine
the
merits
as
whether
equity
can
usefully
act
and
provide
flexible
treatment
according
to
the
necessities
of
the
particular
case.
the
other
difference
is
one
which
was
suggested
by
some
of
justice
whittaker's
remark.
if
there
is
jurisdiction
of
the
–
if
there
is
no
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
the
complaint
must
be
dismissed
at
the
outset.
that's
that.
if
there
is
power
to
deal
with
the
question,
but
this
is
a
matter
of
equitable
discretion,
then
the
court
may
postpone
examining
the
question
of
whether
it
could
afford
a
proper
remedy.
it
may
proceed
step
by
step
judging
according
to
the
cases
it
develops.
and
in
this
kind
of
case,
i
suggest
that
in
accordance
with
the
response
of
the
state
legislature
or
other
state
authorities,
what
action
if
any,
should
be
taken.
as
i
read
this
court's
opinions,
the
court
has
never
held
that
it
lacks
power
to
deal
with
controversies
over
apportionment.
it
adjudicated
such
cases
in
smiley
and
holm,
carroll
and
becker,
koenig
and
flynn
and
then
of
course
later
in
wood
and
broom.
of
the
concurring
opinion
in
wood
and
broom
is
too
short
to
be
absolutely
sure,
but
it
seems
to
me
to
go
on
the
ground
that
the
court
should
decline
to
exercise
its
equitable
discretion
rather
than
on
the
ground
that
it
had
no
power
to
act.
in
the
later
case
of
colegrove
and
green,
as
mr.
rhyne
pointed
out,
a
majority
of
the
judges
who
participated
held
that
there
was
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter.
and
in
--
there's
nothing
in
the
subsequent
cases
which
is
inconsistent
with
that
conclusion.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
are
not
only
many
distinctions
between
this
case
and
colegrove
and
green,
in
terms
of
the
propriety
of
exercising
equitable
jurisdiction,
but
that
there
are
also
two
that
go
to
the
question
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
colegrove
and
green
dealt
with
the
apportionment
of
congressional
districts
and
the
opinion
relied
very
heavily
upon
the
power
of
the
house
of
representative
under
article
1,
section
5
to
judge
the
qualifications
of
its
members
and
on
the
power
of
congress
under
article
1,
section
4
to
regulate
the
time,
place
and
manner
of
holding
elections.
and
then
the
opinion
says,
the
short
of
it
is
that
the
constitution
has
conferred
upon
congress
exclusive
authority
to
secure
fair
representation
by
the
states
in
the
popular
house,
unless
to
the
house
of
representatives
determination
whether
the
states
have
fulfilled
their
responsibility.
in
the
present
case,
we're
dealing
of
course,
with
the
right
to
effective
representation
in
a
state
government.
the
powers
of
congress
under
article
1
are
manifestly
irrelevant.
furthermore,
the
relation
of
the
tennessee
legislature
to
the
apportionment
of
the
seats
of
all
its
members
seems
to
me,
to
be
quite
different
from
the
relation
of
the
congress
to
the
apportionment
of
congressional
districts
in
a
single
state.
because
the
way
the
state
--
where
the
state
legislature
is
involved,
a
reapportionment
would
mean
in
fact,
if
my
count
is
correct,
that
of
the
50
members
who
control
the
lower
house,
at
least
17
couldn't
come
back
the
next
time.
that
sort
of
problem
is
not
involved
when
you're
looking
at
asking
congress
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
apportionment
in
a
single
state
legislature.
now,
it's
true
as
justice
stewart
pointed
out
that
there
remains
the
possible
remedy
of
going
to
congress
and
seeking
to
have
it
act
under
its
power
to
enact
legislation
to
carry
up
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
two
things
are
pertinent
to
consider
in
that
affection.
one
is
of
course
that
the
court
in
other
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
never
allowed
itself
to
be
deterred
from
action
by
the
fact
that
congress
might
act.
the
second
is
that
congressional
action
in
this
field
it
seems
to
me,
could
only
result
in
putting
the
matter
right
back
in
the
courts.
it's
hardly
practicable
indeed,
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
constitutional
power
for
congress
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
apportionment
in
tennessee.
so
the
most
it
could
do
would
be
to
lay
down
a
general
rule
and
then
to
confirm
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
hear
such
cases.
if
we
are
right,
that
jurisdiction
already
exists.
furthermore,
we
do
–-
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
i
don't
think,
but
i
--
i'd
suggest
that
–
that
there
is
no
articulation
of
the
general
rule
by
congress.
the
part
i
was
trying
to
suggest
was
that
the
general
rule
couldn't
be
much
different
from
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
already
says.
so
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
there
would
be
nothing
to
gain
by
–
by
congress
enacted.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
[laughs]
mr.
archibald
cox
but
if
congress
–
if
congress
said
that
in
apportioning
seats
in
the
state
legislature,
no
person
shall
be
denied
due
process
of
law
or
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
it
really
wouldn't
have
added
anything
thus
we
see
it
to
what
the
fourteenth
amendment
already
required.
and
indeed
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
already
require
it,
then
congress
would
now
have
no
power
to
pass
such
legislations.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
–
i
think
that
congress
probably
could
articulate
with
somewhat
more
particularity.
they
rule
that
there
must
–
that
forbids
arbitrary
and
capricious
discrimination.
and
i
would
concede
that
in
theory,
congress
could
add
more.
i
am
trying
to
suggest
first
as
i
said,
the
court
has
never
been
deterred
by
this
and
i
submit
that
it
shouldn't
be
deterred
here.
second,
that
the
congress
really
couldn't
add
very
much
and
that
it
would
end
putting
the
problem
of
passing
on
questions
of
degree
in
the
federal
courts.
now,
we
have
some
indication
although
not
explicitly
dealing
with
cases
of
state
apportionment,
that
congress
is
not
reluctant
to
have
the
federal
court
safeguard
voting
rights.
in
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1957
and
1959,
congress
did
act
not
in
relation
to
state
apportionment,
but
in
relation
to
the
right
to
vote
and
generally
speaking
what
it
did
was
to
direct
the
federal
courts
to
deal
with
the
matter.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
general
jurisdictional
–
or
it
is
labeled
under
1983
too,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
guess
so,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
done
a
good
deal
of
it,
certainly
yes.
i
think
it
has
though.
i
do
think
the
civil
--
that
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
act
is
further
indication
of
a
congressional
additive.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
recent
acts,
yes.
and
that
they
are
--
while
they
don't
precisely
deal
with
our
problem,
we
can't
assign
jurisdiction
under
them.
i
think
they
do
show
a
congressional
attitude
toward
this
problem
which
the
court
should
take
into
account
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
case.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
to
the
question
whether
the
court
should
exercise
the
equitable
discretion
which
we
submit
exists
or
whether
the
case
should
be
dismissed
as
happened
in
colegrove
and
green,
for
what
of
equitable
jurisdiction,
although
the
case
was
within
the
subject
–
within
the
power
of
the
federal
court
to
decide.
in
our
opinion,
there
are
here,
sufficiently
compelling
circumstances.
it
would
make
it
improper
to
dismiss
the
bill
at
this
early
stage
of
the
case.
i
would
like
to
take
those
compelling
circumstances
up
one
by
one.
first,
i
suggest,
is
that
this
is
not
a
very
troublesome
case
for
adjudication
on
the
merits.
as
i
suggested
earlier,
we
do
have
in
the
tennessee
constitution,
the
only
ostensible
basis
for
an
apportionment.
and
the
existing
apportionment
clearly,
egregiously
departs
from
that
standard.
in
the
absence
of
any
other
standard,
then
it
should
not
be
hard
to
decide
whether
this
is
or
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
of
course,
we
suggest
that
it
is.
second
is
the
seriousness
of
the
wrong.
here,
the
apportionment
results
in
giving
roughly
a
third
of
the
people
of
tennessee,
the
power
in
both
houses
in
the
legislature
to
control
the
other
two-thirds.
a
vote
in
some
counties
and
--
is
worth
19
or
20
times
a
vote
in
other
counties.
the
serious
consequences
of
this
kind
of
maldistribution
are
discussed
in
our
brief,
also
in
the
appellant's
brief,
but
i
don't
intend
to
recount
them
all
here.
i
would
emphasize,
however,
that
this
kind
of
wrong
is
peculiarly
one
which
calls
for
judicial
intervention.
we've
often
been
reminded
and
quite
right
that
the
ultimate
safeguard
of
constitutional
rights
is
a
vigilant
electorate.
but
where
the
wrong
goes
to
the
existence
or
distribution
of
the
franchise,
then
the
electorate
can
do
nothing
to
protect
itself.
no
matter
how
vigilant
the
majority
of
the
people
of
tennessee
are,
there
is
nothing
that
they
can
do
under
these
circumstances
to
assert
their
constitutional
rights.
the
only
power
to
reapportion
is
in
the
legislature.
there
is
no
provision
for
initiative
or
referendum.
the
only
power
that
can
call
a
constitutional
convention
is
the
legislature.
the
legislature
of
tennessee
has
failed
to
act
for
60
years
and
the
tennessee
court
has
refused
to
act.
the
short
of
this
case
is
as
judge
miller
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
convening
the
three-judge
court
that
either
there
is
a
remedy
in
the
federal
court
or
there
is
no
remedy
at
all.
so
this
is
not
a
question
where
one
can
look
to
the
working
of
the
political
process
to
solve
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
the
third
point
which
should
be
emphasized
and
i
really
just
spoke
to
it
a
moment
ago
is
that
there
is
no
other
remedy
that
the
plaintiffs
have
here.
i've
outlined
the
lack
of
a
remedy
in
tennessee
and
discussed
earlier,
the
lack
of
a
remedy,
a
practical
remedy
in
congress
and
also
the
fact
that
the
court
has
never
withheld
its
hand
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
waiting
for
congress
to
act
and
is
therefore
no
need
to
re-elaborate
those
propositions.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
what
i
am
suggesting.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
--
all
you
need
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
–
i
think
the
two
possible
views
and
i
would
press
both
on
the
court,
the
normal
practice
is,
of
course,
to
consider
the
question
of
remedies
after
you've
dealt
with
the
merits
as
justice
whittaker
suggested.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
entirely
proper
for
the
court
to
say
there
is
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
we
don't
need
to
go
beyond
that
now.
now,
in
a
number
of
cases,
including
colegrove
and
green
and
no
doubt
some
of
the
per
curiams,
although
i
can
only
speculate
about
them,
the
court
has
gone
ahead
and
said,
“is
there
so
little
chance
that
an
equity
court
could
usefully
contribute
here,
that
the
bill
should
be
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction,
now.
and
i
wouldn't
object
very
much
to
anyone
who's
taking
that
view.
that
is
if
there's
clearly
nothing
the
court
could
usefully
do,
it
might
as
well
say
so
and
be
done
with
it.
but
i
think
all
we
need
to
show
at
this
stage
is
that
one
can't
properly
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there's
clearly
nothing
the
court
can
do
at
this
stage.
that
may
turn
out
later
and
that
brings
me
to
the
question,
what
can
the
court
do
which
should
be
weighed,
i
think,
in
with
the
need
for
action.
after
all,
whether
you
–
mr.
archibald
cox
that
something
i've
lost
to
let
–-
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
–
i
was
urging
that
–
no,
i'm
not
pressing
quite
that
far.
i
would
say
that
it
shows
that
something
should
be
done
if
possible,
but
that
the
court
should
not
finally
determine
at
this
stage
whether
it
is
possible.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
urging
that
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
it
to
rule
now,
that
it
should
withhold
the
hand
of
equity.
it
does
--
what
--
what
i'm
suggesting
is
this,
that
here,
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
after
all,
may
go
through
a
number
of
stages.
and
you'll
first,
be
ruling
on
jurisdiction,
then
one
might
deal
with
the
merits.
and
there
might
be
a
hearing
on
the
--
what
relief
if
any
was
appropriate.
i
think
the
court
has
power
at
anyone
of
those
stages,
to
say,
“now,
that
all
the
facts
have
been
laid
in
front
of
us
and
we
have
studied
them,
we
know
more
than
we
did
before
about
the
possibilities
of
granting
relief.”
that
i
would
say
it
was
possible
at
any
of
those
stages
and
the
court
shouldn't
prejudge
the
question
that
--
that
the
district
court
would
conclude
that
there
wasn't
any
useful
relief
that
could
be
administered.
i
don't
think
it'll
turn
out
that
way,
but
i
don't
see
any
occasion
to
decide
that
in
advance.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
because
there
maybe
a
case
where
the
court
of
equity
just
couldn't
work
out
any
sensible
form
of
equitable
relief.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
going
to
say,
let
me
use
colegrove
and
green
as
an
example.
in
colegrove
and
green,
there
were
apparently
only
two
choices.
one
would
be
to
hold
the
election
at
large.
now,
there,
the
disease
might
well
be
worst
than
the
cure
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
[laughs]
well,
it's
enough
that
it'd
be
words.
mr.
archibald
cox
[laughs]
i
mean
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
my
point
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
has
been
made
for
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
my
recollection,
mr.
justice
black.
in
wood
and
broom?
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
in
wood
and
broom,
the
complaint
was
dismissed.
it
was
held
that
the
–-
that
the
1911
was
an
apportionment
act,
did
not
require
an
equitable
division
of
the
districts
within
the
state.
i
suggest
you
must
be
thinking
–-
mr.
archibald
cox
in
wood
and
broom?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
complainants
were
challenging.
i
guess
i'd
--
i
guess
the
answer
is
i
don't
remember.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
other
possible
remedy
in
colegrove
and
green
would
have
been
to
redraw
the
illinois
congressional
districts
on
the
man.
now,
i
don't
see
how
a
court
could
embark
on
such
a
test
as
that.
that
it
--
it
--
there
are
just
too
many
possibilities,
that
it's
too
much
involved
in
the
political
process,
that
it
is
something
that
the
court
really
shouldn't
undertake
to
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
attempting
to
layout
30
equally
apportioned
--
whatever
the
number
is
30
districts
for
the
election
of
congressional
representatives
on
the
map
of
illinois
with
nothing
to
start
with
except
the
outline
of
the
map
and
the
figures
on
the
voting
population.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
my
suggestion
was
that
the
court
did
not
have
to
rule
on
that
question
at
this
stage,
that
it
could
send
it
back
for
the
guidance
of
the
lower
court
and
i
presume
that
the
court
could
decide
whether
it
wished
to
decide
it
on
the
papers
or
whether
it
wished
to
take
further
testimony.
mr.
archibald
cox
are
different.
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
question
does
not
need
to
be
determined
now,
if
the
court
is
–-
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
be
--
it
be
argued
in
detail,
in
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
it
will
–
whichever
way
it
went,
it
might
well
come
back
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
therefore
--
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
it
could
come
back
(voice
overlap)
–-
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
could
come
back
immediately
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
only
if
it
were
dismissed
below,
which
seems
unlikely
on
the
basis
of
the
court's
opinion,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
fully
went
into
this
question.
and
this
court
--
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
earlier
was
that
this
court
might
want
the
benefit
of
a
full
exploration
of
the
point
by
the
three-judge
court
before
it
decided.
i
would
think
this
was
a
matter
–-
this
court
should
determine
on
the
basis
of
how
sure
it
feels
or
what
doubts
it
has
about
whether
the
complaint
does
state
a
cause
of
action.
the
point
that
i
was
seeking
to
make,
justice
whittaker,
is
that
the
problem
of
the
remedy
here
differs
very
greatly
from
case-to-case.
that
there
maybe
cases
dealing
with
apportionment
where
we
could
--
could
see
–
let
me
say
simply
for
the
purposes
of
argument
as
you
will,
that
it
would
be
so
far
removed
from
a
judicial
function
that
the
court
should
not
embark
on
the
test.
we
do
not
think
that
this
is
such
a
case.
the
time
is
so
short
that
i
can't
go
into
it,
but
there
are
four
and
i
suggest
a
fifth
factor
in
the
present
situation
that
sharply
distinguishes
colegrove
and
green.
in
the
first
place,
the
tennessee
constitution
requires
an
apportionment
in
the
relation
to
population.
second,
it
says
that
it
must
be
by
counties,
where
possible.
third,
no
county
may
be
divided.
fourth,
when
counties
are
put
together,
they
must
be
adjacent.
and
then
i
would
add
that
if
the
court
were
driven
to
the
point
where
it
must
intervene,
that
i
think
we
would
all
agree
that
there
should
be
as
little
disturbance
of
the
existing
districts
for
the
house
and
senate
as
possible.
now,
taking
the
map
with
respect
to
the
senate,
one
can
remove
the
most
glaring
of
the
inequities,
simply
by
merging
five
existing
pairs
of
senatorial
districts
and
allocating
the
senators
say,
if
--
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
to
the
chattanooga
area,
the
knoxville
area,
the
nashville
area
and
the
memphis
area.
this
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
involve
any
of
the
difficulties,
at
least
in
anything
like
the
same
degree
that
there
were
in
colegrove
and
green.
one
can
accomplish
much
of
the
same
thing
by
putting
11
pairs
of
adjacent
counties
together
in
the
house
of
representatives.
so
that
the
range
of
discretion
and
the
degree
of
interference
which
would
be
involved,
if
the
court
were
forced
to
go
this
far
would
be
very
small
indeed.
now,
i'd
like
to
make
one
more
point
with
respect
to
the
remedy.
it's
quite
clear
of
course,
that
what
is
most
to
be
desired
is
that
the
tennessee
legislature
and
the
people
of
tennessee
will
themselves
correct
this.
and
one
of
the
advantages
of
a
court
of
equity
is
that
it
can
proceed
slowly
and
a
step
at
a
time.
up
to
this
point,
the
tennessee
authorities
have
simply
taken
the
position
as
i
understand
it,
well
nobody
touches.
if
the
federal
court
takes
jurisdiction,
that
in
itself
will
generate
great
forces
for
a
change.
if
the
court
goes
on
to
the
merits
and
holds
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
apportionment,
i
should
be
amazed
if
the
tennessee
legislature
didn't
act.
after
all,
the
force
of
the
principle
of
legitimacy,
the
solemn
adjudication
that
there
is
a
constitutional
obligation
carries
a
great
effect
with
most
of
the
people
in
this
country.
so
that
at
that
stage,
as
happened
in
new
jersey,
there's
a
very
good
chance
that
the
legislature
would
act.
finally,
there
are
these
remedies
and
others
are
outlined
in
our
brief,
if
the
court
were
driven
to
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
state
first
as
clearly
as
possible
the
issues
which
we
think
this
case
presents,
which
ones
need
to
be
decided
at
this
time
and
which
we
think
can
be
deferred
and
finally
the
position
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
each
of
these
issues.
the
central
question
of
course
is
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
the
complaint
alleges
an
intentional
invidious
discrimination
depriving
the
plaintiffs
of
their
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
general
jurisdictional
statues
give
the
district
courts
jurisdiction
over
all
claims
for
depravation
of
constitutional
rights
under
color
of
state
law.
and
i
remind
the
course
--
court
that
under
bell
and
hood
incomparable
cases,
it's
enough
that
the
complaint
state
a
colorable
cause
of
action
in
order
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction
without
going
on
to
pass
upon
the
merits
of
the
constitution.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
there
were
two
--
there
were
four
in
that
as
a
matter
fact.
but
they
were
on
those
two
grounds,
mr.
justice
stewart.
and
the
court
--
the
court's
order
refers
to
both
grounds.
there's
no
question
about
that
either.
it
seems
to
me,
the
meaning
of
the
dismissal
for
one
of
jurisdiction
is
fine
i
take
it.
there's
some
dispute
about
the
meaning
of
the
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
i
emphasized
the
latter
words
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that
was
the
meaning
that
the
district
court
attached
to
the
order
rather
than
the
notion
that
there
wasn't
a
substantive
claim
stated.
because
if
you
read
as
mr.
rhyne
pointed
out
the
court's
opinion,
it
refers
to
the
claim
of
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
the
claim
of
rights
under
the
state
constitution.
and
then
in
the
next
sentence
it
says,
"we
agree
that
there
has
been
both
the
violation
of
the
state
constitution
and
the
plaintiffs'
rights",
which
i
take
it
referrs
back
to
the
first
seven.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
in
any
event,
the
court's
opinion
plainly
discusses
only
the
remedy.
it
does
nothing
--
there's
not
a
word
in
dealing
with
the
substantive
claim
of
a
violation
of
fourteenth
amendment
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
i
think
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
would
think
a
difference
might
be
taken
then.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
on
the
argument
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
going
to
the
merits
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
claim,
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
state
to
say,
"look
at
this
apportionment.
this
is
explained
by
our
desire
to
represent
people
according
to
the
proportion
of
taxes
paid.”
or
look,
“this
is
explained
by
our
desire
to
give
every
county
or
every
town
as
in
new
england,
a
representative.”
so
that
it
would
seem
to
me
that
procedurally,
that
issue
might
arise
under
acts
upon
it
called
a
demurrer
rather
than
a
motion
to
dismiss.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
a
question
that
might
require
proof
of
some
fact
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
and
in
that
event
it
would
come
up
to
the
--
a
later
stage.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
quite
true.
the
one
thing
that
it
seems
to
me
must
be
decided.
finally
now
is
the
narrow
question
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
the
sense
of
power
to
deal
with
it.
that
issue,
i
think,
has
to
be
decided,
inescapable.
and
we
argue
of
course
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction.
as
the
circuit
question
presented,
somewhat
related
to
the
first
which
is
whether
the
district
court
may
consider
the
merits
of
appellants'
claim
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
what
else?
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i've
just
--
let
me
say
there
--
there
is
a
second
question
in
the
case
which
is
whether
the
bill
should
be
dismissed
in
the
exercise
of
an
equitable
discretion.
there
is
the
doctrine,
which
i'm
sure
the
court
is
familiar
with
after
the
first
argument,
that
sometimes,
when
an
equity
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
and
even
though
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
of
law
still
because
the
matter
is
not
suitable
for
the
chancellor's
action
either
because
their
act
would
be
against
the
public
interest
or
because
it
would
entangle
in
a
non-traditional
function.
the
bill
will
be
dismissed
for
one
of
equity.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
it
--
substantially,
yes.
it
would
seem
to
me
it
stated
most
accurately,
this
question
may
be
before
the
court.
are
the
chances
of
framing
some
kind
of
effective
relief
so
small
and
the
likely
danger
to
the
public
from
continuing
with
the
case
so
great
that
the
court
should
shut
off
further
investigation
of
that
question
at
this
stage?
before
it
looked
at
the
merits,
investigated
the
alleged
wrong
or
before
there
was
a
full
hearing
and
discussion
on
the
question
of
relief.
i
simply
say
that
it
is
not
that
clear
and
the
chancellor
can
exercise
his
discretion
or
at
some
later
stage
of
the
case
if
it
does
appear
that
there
is
no
way
to
grant
relief
within
circumscribed
by
the
limits
of
the
judicial
function.
and
we
argue
that
there
are
enough
possibilities
of
relief
so
that
the
plaintiffs'
case
shouldn't
be
shut
off
at
the
outset.
mr.
archibald
cox
on
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
my
recollection
is
that
there
is
precedent
for
granting
a
negative
injunction.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
didn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
it
was
--
let's
--
let
us
just
add
a
little
bit
to
the
case
and
assume
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no,
but
i
think
this
case
--
i
think
your
case,
it
does
illustrate
one
of
the
points
i
was
trying
to
make.
let's
assume
that
the
prayer
was
for
an
injunction
compelling
her
to
sing
plus
a
prayer
for
other
and
further
relief.
and
let's
assume
that
it
was
suggested
during
the
argument
on
the
original
motion
to
dismiss
that
may
be
the
negative
injunction
would
do
some
good.
on
the
other
hand,
the
defendants
said,
"no,
it
won't
do
any
good
at
all.
you
can't
frame
a
negative
injunction
that
will
work."
it
would
seem
to
me
that
would
be
quite
proper
for
the
chancellor
under
those
circumstances
to
say,
"we're
not
going
to
shut
the
door,
and
is
it
mr.
bing
who
had
the
first
contract,
we
are
going
to
investigate
this
question
of
relief."
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
i
suppose
that
in
this
case
if
the
complainants
were
to
say
to
the
court,
"the
only
thing
that
we
ask
is
an
injunction
against
the
legislature
of
tennessee
and
there
were
no
prayer
for
other
relief
and
they
disclaimed
any
desire
for
other
relief.”
well,
then
there
might
be
nothing
more
to
the
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
at
this
stage.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
shall
later
try
to
suggest
some
of
the
possible
forms
of
relief.
i
wouldn't
want
my
ignorance
of
all
the
court's
decision
indicated
was
not
in
that
category.i
don't
know
of
one.
there
is
a
third
question
which
is
potentially
in
the
case
and
which
i
think
i
should
note
expressly
that
is
of
course
the
question
of
whether
the
fact
stated
in
the
complaint
do
make
out
a
cause
of
action.
as
i
suggested
before
that
issue
does
not
in
our
judgment
need
to
be
decided
at
this
stage
of
the
case.
on
the
other
hand,
as
mr.
justice
black
suggested
during
the
original
argument,
it
is
a
question
that
here
--
here
without
a
decision
below
but
nevertheless
here,
if
there
is
jurisdiction
that
may
arise
sooner
or
later.
and
i
take
that
the
complainants
would
have
no
objection
to
a
decision
on
it
now.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
it,
we
think
it
is
clear
that
at
least
a
colorable
case
is
stated
and
that
this
court
would
be
well
advised
to
remand
the
case
so
the
district
court
might
give
it
the
benefit
of
a
full
opinion
investigation
of
the
question
which
might
be
on
the
facts
and
not
just
on
the
pleading.
that
last
question
is
involved
in
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
i
think,
to
this
extent.
the
justiciability
of
the
case
depends
in
part
upon
whether
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim
that
is
made
are
need
for
or
amenable
to
judicial
consideration,
upon
whether
the
interest
that
deserve
constitutional
protection
here
are
sufficiently
identifiable.
the
fact
is
that
--
would
have
to
be
taken
into
account
are
sufficiently
articulateable
so
that
the
case
can
be
adjudicated
and
so
you
can
take
a
hold
of
it
and
reach
a
conclusion.
as
i
say,
i
don't
indicate
final
decision
on
that
point
need
be
made.
but
since
it
does
bear
upon
the
justiciability
of
the
cause,
i'm
going
to
direct
my
attention
to
it
first
and
then
go
on
in
sequence
to
the
other
aspects
of
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
finally
to
deal
with
the
argument
concerning
equitable
discretion.
the
right
to
be
free
from
hostile
or
capricious
discrimination
in
the
definition
of
the
person
invited
--
entitled
to
vote
or
the
exercise
of
the
franchise
is
a
federal
right
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
although
the
clearest
examples
involved
racial
discrimination,
the
fourteenth
amendment
ex
--
extends
this
course,
prohibits
of
course
arbitrary
and
capricious
actions
against
other
classes
of
people.
and
surely
it
would
violate
both
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
for
a
state
to
deny
the
franchise,
say
to
all
people
who
would
ever
visit
at
the
british
commonwealth
or
to
all
red-headed
women
or
on
any
other
entirely
arbitrary
basis.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
geographical
--
mr.
archibald
cox
so
far
as
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose
the
question
would
be
raised
whether
that
was
an
arbitrary
discrimination.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'd
forgotten
the
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
it
was
not
an
arbitrary
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
it
--
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
a
rational
line
can
be
drawn
in
voting
between
men
and
women
does
not
go
to
--
it
indicate
that
a
rational
line
can
be
drawn
in
terms
of
race
or
in
terms
of
geography.
surely
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh,
and
in
voting.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
in
--
in
terms
of
the
whole
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
legal
background.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
not
have
quarreled
with
the
decision
of
the
court.
surely,
nothing
in
the
decision
and
i
think
this
is
the
only
important
one.
surely
nothing
in
the
decision
indicates
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
prohibit
irrational
differentiations
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
vote.
and
a
geographical
discrimination
i
think
must
be
agreed,
can
be
as
arbitrary
and
discriminatory
as
many
others.
nobody
would
debate
the
case.
if
a
state
were
to
say
that
the
voters
in
the
eastern
half
shall
have
10
votes
and
the
voters
at
the
western
half
shall
each
have
one
or
one
vote
and
one-tenth
of
the
vote.
if
i
--
the
process
of
apportioning
representatives,
the
state
gives
10
representatives
to
each
of
the
sparsely
settled
counties
in
the
eastern
half
and
only
one
to
each
of
the
well-settled
counties
of
the
western
half.
that
seems
to
me
just
as
arbitrary
and
just
as
capricious
as
labeling
of
the
fraction
of
the
vote
that
those
underrepresented
are
entitled
to
get.
certainly,
there
is
no
merit
in
the
argument
that
the
appellees
make
that
the
constitution
guarantees
only
the
right
to
cast
a
ballot
and
have
it
physically
counted
but
it
doesn't
guarantee
you
anything
with
respect
to
the
value
of
the
count
that
it
gets
and
that
it
may
be
neglected
from
then
on.
now
of
course,
the
present
case
isn't
quite
as
clear
as
my
examples
although
i
think
it
is
a
very
clear
one.
but
in
relation
to
it
and
in
relation
to
the
question
whether
this
is
a
justiciable
problem,
the
question
does
arise
unless
the
constitution
guarantees
exact
numerical
equality,
how
can
a
court
determine
whether
a
malapportionment
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
my
judgment,
there
are
two
steps
to
the
analysis.
one
of
which
the
court
certainly
can
take
and
the
other
--
and
which
is
sufficient
for
this
case.
the
other
of
which
a
court
might
take
or
might
take
it
in
part
that
the
first
step
is
simply
to
inquire
whether
there
is
any
rational
justification
or
any
coherent
purpose
for
the
discrimination
or
differentiation
of
something
other
than
sheer
caprice
or
indifference
or
the
perpetuation
of
unjustified
political
power.
since
there
is
no
foundation
for
the
discrimination
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
need
to
go
further.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
--
i
suppose
all
i
am
really
arguing
that
is
--
insofar
as
the
pleadings
go,
that
would
be
a
fair
conclusion.
there
are
a
good
many
things
that
points
strongly
in
favor
of
that
conclusion.
and
one
of
them,
if
i
may
deal
at
this
point,
was
the
question
that
was
raised,
one
of
them
is
the
fact
that
the
only
basis
permitted
by
the
tennessee
constitution
for
apportionment
is
equality
of
representation
according
to
population.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
hardly
lies
in
the
mouth
of
tennessee
to
say,
"oh,
but
there
was
another
rational
reason
for
doing
it",
which
doesn't
appear.
i
think
for
the
state,
i
won't
say
that
in
the
matter
of
law,
the
state
could
not
possibly
come
in
and
show
another
rational
foundation.
i
do
say
that
the
fact
that
there
is
this
provision
that
permits
no
other,
the
fact
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
60
years
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
had
gone
by
may
indicate
pretty
strongly
certainly
enough
to
put
the
burden
on
them
to
come
forward
and
to
indicate
the
rational
basically
first.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
state
--
as
far
as
my
argument
is
concerned,
if
the
state
had
written
this
provision
into
its
constitution
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
nothing
i
say
is
directed
to
the
proposition
that
it
would
then
be
constitutional.
i
would
still
be
here
if
i
could
find
the
complainant's
argument
come
in
as
amicus,
i
would
still
be
here
arguing
that
it
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
cannot
speak
with
any
great
degree
of
knowledge
without
the
political
history
of
tennessee.
my
reading
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
would
indicate
that
the
difficulty
wasn't
in
getting
the
two
houses
to
agree.
it
was
simply
that
minority
who
have
these
unjustified,
as
we
say
of
power,
won't
give
it
up.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
--
i
had
hoped
to
pros
--
postpone
until
later
the
question
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
of
what
the
--
the
degree
might
be.
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
there
were
a
considerable
number
of
possibilities
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
tried
--
you
could
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
does
not.
and
frequently,
telling
them
what
they
are
doing
is
unlawful
supplies
the
necessary
impetus
to
achieve
a
solution
of
the
matter.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
just
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
is
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
in
determining
--
first
i
have
not
suggested
that
there
is
no
other
relief
that
the
court
could
frame.
i
think
that
in
determining
how
to
exercise
its
discretion,
one
of
the
factors
that
this
court
may
take
into
account,
i
think
it
frequently
has
taken
it
into
account,
is
the
very
great
likelihood
that
public
officials
and
others
in
this
country
will
comply
with
the
law
where
it
is
clearly
had
declaimed.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
mr.
justice,
there
have
been
other
cases
i
think
where
the
court
had
rarely
had
to
resort
to
its
physical
power.
it's
very
doubtful
whether
the
decree
would
ever
have
been
made
effective.
there
was
the
decree
of
course
which
john
marshall
said
--
of
which
andrew
jackson
said
john
marshall
has
made
a
decree
now
letting
enforcement.
there'd
been
case
--
there's
a
case
if
my
memory
is
right
where
the
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
have
also
been
cases,
there
was
one,
i
think
where
governor
phillips
of
oklahoma
was
enjoined
from
declaring
martial
law.
i
suppose
if
you'd
really
been
determined
to
go
on,
he
could
have
called
out
the
army
and
stopped
the
building
of
the
dam,
i
think
it
was
that
he
was
going
to
build.
but
my
point
--
i'd
spoke
too
slowly
i
guess
because
i
only
got
about
one-tenth
of
my
answer
to
your
honors'
question.
i
suggest
that
this
is
a
legitimate
consideration.
now,
i
don't
argue
to
this
court
that
it
is
the
only
consideration
or
that
this
is
the
only
ground
on
which
it
might
decide
to
exercise
of
the
jurisdiction
here.
i
do
stress
it's
important.
i
do
think
that
by
and
large
the
people
in
this
country
recognize
that
a
representative
democracy
depends
upon
voluntary
compliance
with
law
and
that
once
this
court
or
another
court
focus
its
attention
on
what
the
law
is,
then
the
chances
that
the
legislature
or
other
public
officials
will
comply
with
it
are
very
great
and
much
greater
than
they
are
while
the
issue
remains
(inaudible)
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
we
do
have
some
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
recent
cases
are
decisions
by
the
federal
district
court
of
minnesota
following
which
the
legislature
reapportionment.
it
was
a
decision
by
a
single
district
judge
in
hawaii
which
was
followed
by
reapportionment.
there
was
a
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
which
went
to
--
if
i
may
speak
colloquially,
right
down
to
the
wire
but
the
new
jersey
legislature
did
reapportion.
there
is
also
--
it's
also
reported,
i
suppose
nobody
can
vouch
for
this
to
prove
it's
authenticity
that
the
fact
of
the
decision
was
five-to-four
and
--
four-to-three
in
colegrove
and
green,
induced
governor
green
to
accept
a
reapportionment,
prepare
that
the
next
time
there
might
be
nine
members
sitting.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
that
--
i
don't
know
about
the
earlier
cases.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
there
have
been
--
mr.
archibald
cox
there
have
been
a
number
of
state
cases
holding
apportionment
acts
invalid
and
the
state
banished
one
way
or
another.
i
can't
give
the
detail
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
--
that
is
--
that's
--
they
are
more
particular
--
most
of
them
are
more
particular,
not
all.
there
are
some
states
for
example
which
have
never
specified
in
their
constitution
at
all
what
the
basis
of
apportionment
as
debated.
there
are
three
or
four
of
them.
i
don't
recall
the
exact
names.
now,
i
think
that
on
the
question
--
the
question
concerned
what
remedies
might
be
awarded.
i'd
been
trying
to
emphasize
the
flexibility
that
the
court
of
equity
had
and
the
likelihood
that
perhaps
taking
jurisdiction
or
a
decision
on
the
merits
would
induce
a
favorable
result.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
simply
looking
at
the
map
of
tennessee
and
the
facts
that
we
have
here
that
there
are
some
other
possibilities.
one
would
be
to
require
an
election
at
large.
another
would
be
to
follow
the
suggestion
of
two
judges
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
allow
the
election
to
go
forward
in
the
existing
districts
but
wait
the
votes
which
might
be
permitted
to
cast
in
the
legislature.
with
respect
to
the
house,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
i
were
the
chancellor,
i
would
consider
doing
this.
i'd
take
those
--
before
i
make
a
suggestion
let
me
back
up
a
little,
the
tennessee
constitution,
because
it
has
a
degree
of
specificity
greater
than
the
fourteenth
amendment,
does
limit
inevitably
the
possible
ways
of
reapportionment.
it
requires
that
the
--
no
county
be
broken
up
that
if
two
counties
are
combined
they
must
be
adjacent.
it
requires
the
representation
in
both
houses
to
be
made
according
to
population.
and
i
take
it
we
would
also
agree
that
if
a
court
were
compelled
to
interfere
with
the
way
the
next
election
is
held
that
it
should
prescribe
these
few
changes
as
possible.
now,
the
two
things
which
occurred
to
me
might
be
done
by
the
court,
take
first
the
tennessee
house
of
representatives.
suppose
that
the
court
were
to
enjoin
the
holding
of
another
election
which
is
--
what
would
violate
the
plaintiffs'
rights
unless
the
following
steps
were
taken.
and
then
we
are
to
prescribed
that
the
election
authorities
should
allocate
to
each
of
the
counties
in
the
smallest
group,
say
having
8000
voters
or
less,
one
representative
and
then
we
are
to
allocate
representatives
to
all
the
other
counties
if
the
relation
of
their
population
and
the
ratio
of
their
population
to
a
county,
this
would
give
you
a
somewhat
larger
legislature
than
tennessee
has
today
and
somewhat
larger
than
the
constitutional
limit
fixed
in
tennessee.
but
one
would
then
come
up
against
this
question.
tennessee
is
plainly
violating
its
own
constitution
today
in
a
number
of
instances.
i
would
think
that
the
one
fixing
a
ceiling
on
the
numbers
was
far
less
important
than
the
requirement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
the
tennessee
constitution
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suggest
this
is
one
possibility.
i
can
suggest
another
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
would
think
in
--
it's
fundamentally
irrelevant
to
the
argument
that
the
present
system
violates
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
assume
that
in
framing
any
decree,
the
federal
court
--
mr.
archibald
cox
would
follow
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
in
framing
the
remedy,
of
course,
it's
a
matter
of
federal
law.
now,
from
using
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
that
it
in
a
loose
--
in
a
loose
sense,
that
could
be
said,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
what
some
state
courts
have
done.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
basically
here
the
argument
does
turn
on
a
question
of
what
is
the
proper
scope
of
judicial
power.
it
involves
the
debate
about
that
conception.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
proper
to
take
account.
its
where
--
if
this
court
is
not
bound
by
it
of
course
to
take
accounts
of
the
experience
of
state
courts
in
dealing
with
this
kind
of
question.
if
looking
at
that
experience
shows
that
they
have
not
become
involved
in
the
politics
of
the
people,
as
your
honors
called
it,
and
have
not
lost
standing
in
exercising
the
judicial
function
that
its
some
evidence
half
persuasive
as
a
matter
of
judgment
that
this
court
in
exercising
more
power
than
was
exercised
in
colegrove
and
green
might
not
do
any
damage
to
the
fundamental
character
of
our
institutions
or
to
the
court.
now
may
i
on
the
matters
of
the
remedy
suggest
one
other
possibility
that
is
outlined
in
our
brief
in
more
detail
and
this
time
i
refer
to
the
senate
of
tennessee.
there
are
five
pairs
of
tennessee
counties
--
of
tennessee
senatorial
districts,
excuse
me.
each
of
which
has
a
representative
today
which
if
they
were
combined
would
have
just
about
the
right
number
of
voters
to
entitle
them
to
one
representative.
they
are
adjacent.
they
are
each
--
and
in
a
separate
district,
senatorial
district
now.
you
could
put
them
together.
take
the
five
votes
thus
saved
in
the
senate
and
distribute
them
among
the
four
heavily
unrepresented
senatorial
districts
and
the
result
would
be
--
not
to
achieve
a
proper
apportionment
but
to
cure
the
most
egregious
unfairness
in
the
present
setup.
now,
i
suggest
that
that
is
far
from
remapping
tennessee.
it
takes
the
existing
district
just
about
as
they
stand
except
for
seeing
out
as
one
does
on
the
zoning
map
the
lines
between
each
of
these
five
pairs,
everything
else
would
be
just
as
the
tennessee
legislature
set
it
up
and
just
as
the
elections
have
been
conducted
in
the
past.
it's
neither
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'm
--
i'm
going
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
going
a
step
beyond
that
i
think.
i'm
suggesting
that
the
decree
of
the
district
court,
if
the
case
came
to
that,
that
the
decree
of
the
district
court
could
with
respect
to
the
senate,
enjoin
the
holding
of
an
election
in
these
five
pairs
of
county
except
in
accordance
with
the
putting
together
that
i
suggest
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
you've
certainly
grant
a
stay.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
assume
that
any
relief
in
a
case
of
this
kind
would
not
become
final
beyond
the
possibility
of
the
stay
are
supersedeas
until
this
court
had
acted.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they
--
they
certainly
would
apportion
and
have
great
freedom
to
apportion
according
to
their
own
pairings.
as
we
try
to
suggest
in
our
brief,
the
job
of
making
the
apportionment
is
something
which
is
up
to
the
individual
state
legislature.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
all
--
all
i'm
trying
to
do
is
to
suggest
that
one
with
all
the
facts
in
front
of
him,
it
isn't
hopeless
to
find
the
remedy
which
would
not
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
not
sure
first
that
i
would
class
that
as
a
similar
situation.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
i
meant
to
say
simpler.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
class
it
as
the
simpler
situation
by
any
means.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
--
i
would
i
have
--
i
would
myself
doubted
that.
i
maybe
wrong
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
that
i
would
doubt
whether
it
was
a
deep-seated.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
one
of
--
one
of
the
parts
that
bothers
me
here,
mr.
justice,
it's
--
it's
the
converse
in
a
sense
of
what
i
said
earlier.
i
spoke
of
the
affirmative
effect
of
a
decree
pointing
out
the
constitutional
duty
of
the
legislature.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
court
says,
“this
isn't
justiceable.
we
can't
do
anything
about
it.”
that
it
comes
very
close
to
saying
in
the
lay
mind,
“oh,
this
isn't
a
serious
problem.
it
shouldn't
be
worried
about.”
i
arch
to
saying
there
is
since
there's
no
remedy,
there
isn't
any
wrong
at
all.
indeed,
if
your
honor
will
forgive
me,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
speaking
of
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
you
said
since
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
refused
to
act,
that
established
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
tennessee
constitution.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i'm
not
sure
even
if
i
may
that
that
is
correct.
for
example,
when
this
court
in
giles
and
harris
dismissed
the
bill
in
equity,
it
did
not,
at
least
for
all
time,
established
the
proposition
that
they
are
victim
of
racial
discrimination
with
respect
to
a
state
election,
had
no
legal
right.
it
is
established
the
proposition
for
a
time
at
least
that
there
was
no
remedy
in
equity.
very
shortly
later
and
actual
damages
was
allowed
in
a
substantially
the
same
situation
which
established
that
there
was
a
substantive
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
if
your
honor
runs
the
case
down
in
sheppard,
you
will
find
that
mr.
justice
brandeis
often
cited
it
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
legal
right
of
equity.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
i'd
--
i'd
misspoke
myself
that
there
was
no
remedy
in
equity
for
that
political
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
one
of
the
grounds
mentioned.
i
think
if
you
read
the
opinion
you
will
find
that
the
other
ground
was
involved,
too.
i've
covered
my
point
somewhat
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
oh,
no.
not
at
all,
but
it
does
establish
the
proposition
that
the
in
--
unavailability
of
an
equitable
remedy
which
was
held
what
was
not
available
in
tennessee
does
not
establish
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
substantive
right
which
was
the
only
point
i
was
seeking
to
make.
now,
the
difficulty
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
of
course
is
quite
true.
and
i
am
arguing
that
a
remedy
which
the
tennessee
court
withheld
should
be
granted
in
the
lower
court
if
upon
further
examination
of
this
case,
it
appears
both
that
relief
is
necessary
because
the
state
refused
to
act
when
its
federal
constitutional
duty
was
pointed
out
and
if
it
appears
that
a
suitable
remedy
can
be
framed.
i
do
want
to
make
just
one
or
two
further
remarks
about
the
nature
of
the
substantive
right
that
we're
relying
on
here.
and
of
necessity,
they
will
have
to
be
very
brief.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
ours
is
not
a
purely
mathematical
argument.
we
recognized
that
although
one
should
start
with
equality
of
voting
weight
under
our
tradition
that
that's
not
the
end
of
the
question.
and
in
our
brief,
we
indicated
through
a
study
of
the
state
constitution
of
what
other
opposing
desiderata
have
been
taken
into
account.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they're
not
very
numerous.
and
no
doubt
there
could
be
more.
and
now
we
fully
recognize
that
weighing
and
balancing
such
considerations
is
the
function
of
the
state
legislature
and
that
the
arts
of
accommodation
compromise
the
political
maneuvers
that
frequently
creep
in
are
all
within
the
political
power
of
the
state.
but
we
say
that
the
fact
that
the
state
has
very
wide
discretion
in
the
exercise
of
that
political
power
and
of
the
fact
that
the
court
recognizes
its
broad
political
power
does
not
require
exulting
that
aspect
of
the
state's
power
into
an
absolute
to
quote
gomillion
and
lightfoot.
indeed,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
principle
the
case
of
gomillion
and
lightfoot
is
very
similar
to
us.
i
did
not
see
why
a
case
should
be
more
justiciable
because
it
arose
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
rather
than
the
fourteenth.
and
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
the
--
that
the
principle
should
be
limited
to
racial
discrimination.
there
are
other
forms
of
discrimination
that
maybe
equally
invidious.
i
want
to
say
one
--
one
word,
if
i
may
mr.
justice,
in
the
case
of
this
importance
on
the
point
of
judicial
philosophy
that
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
earlier.
this
is
obviously
a
very
important
case
one
which
will
affect
our
representative
institution
for
a
long
time
so
far
as
anyone
could
judge.
the
issue
is
not
confined
to
tennessee.
it
affects
number
of
states
all
over
the
country.
plainly,
it's
also
a
very
important
question
for
this
court
in
terms
of
this
court's
place
in
our
tripartite
governmental
system.
probably,
the
most
difficult
questions
are
those
that
involve
a
determination
of
the
proper
limits
of
the
judicial
function.
we
fully
recognized
that
there
wrongs
which
can
be
righted
only
by
the
people
or
by
the
legislature.
this
court
doesn't
carry
the
whole
burden
of
government
and
for
it
to
rush
in
to
try
and
deal
--
right
political
wrongs
instead
of
leaving
them
to
the
other
branches,
the
political
branches
of
the
government
could
impair
its
usefulness
and
it's
usefulness
in
our
constitutional
system.
but
i
suggest
to
you
that
judicial
inaction
through
excessive
caution
or
through
a
fancied
impotence
in
the
face
of
crying
necessity
and
very
serious
wrong
may
also
do
damage
to
our
constitutional
system.
they
also
do
them
indeed
greater
damage
including
the
judicial
prayer.
the
question
it
seems
to
me,
was
very
well
put
by
professor
freud
in
another
connection
where
he
said
the
question
is
not
whether
the
courts
--
court
can
do
everything.
the
question
is
whether
the
court
can
do
something.
and
he
went
on
to
point
out
that
education
and
self-improvement
maybe
fostered
by
judicious
views
of
judicial
power.
and
the
force
of
a
court
decision,
i
would
emphasize,
is
not
confined
simply
by
the
scope
of
its
decree.
it
has
a
vast
influence
upon
the
state
court
and
upon
their
ability
and
willingness
to
deal
with
this
question
under
the
state
constitution
which
is
where
very
much
of
it
should
be
handled.
furthermore,
the
course
of
the
decision
extends
because
of
the
moral
power
of
this
court
influence,
a
great
deal
farther.
justice
jackson
just
before
he
went
out
on
the
court
wrote,
“a
court
which
is
governed
by
a
sense
of
self-restraint
does
not
thereby
become
parallels.
it
simply
conserves
its
strength
to
strike
more
telling
blows
in
the
course
of
working
democracy.”
i
suggest
this
is
the
occasion
for
such
a
blow.
