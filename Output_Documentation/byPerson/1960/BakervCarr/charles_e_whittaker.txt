justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
understand
that
there
never
could
be
a
split
of
a
county
--
you
take
a
whole
county
into
a
district
or
none
of
it,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
you
don't
content
i
would
suppose
then
that
there
has
to
be
exact
equality.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
three-judge
court
judgment
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
does
this
tax
under
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
even
if
they
did,
wouldn't
you
then
have
just
what
you
have
now?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
how
would
that
help?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
would
make
this
bill
affirmative
actions
or
non-action?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
about
the
suggestions
that
will
be
time
enough
to
meet
that
situation
if
it
arises?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
if
we
should
take
your
view,
need
we
do
more
than
call
that
the
complaint
states
a
cause
of
action
and
that
the
district
court
must
exercise
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
i
properly
gather
that
the
arguments
you've
been
making
(inaudible)
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
(inaudible)
you're
proceeding
on
the
due
process
basis.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
equal
protection
clause.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
solicitor,
specifically,
are
you
urging
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
as
you
contend
there
is,
then
this
is
not
a
proper
case
for
it
to
withhold
the
hand
of
equity?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
there
is
a
clear
constitutional
right
that's
being
violated
and
if
these
parties
have
standing
to
raise
the
question,
then
is
there
not
both
power
and
duty
in
the
courts
to
enforce
that
constitutional
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
if
there
is
–-
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
if
there
is
then,
once
you
concede
the
power,
then
how
could
there
be
a
case
of
justifiable
equitable
withholding
of
the
hand?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
is
-–
what
is
too
much
involved
in
the
(inaudible)
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
glasgow,
granting
that
that
would
be
--
maybe
true
as
respects
in
an
elected
official,
does
that
prevent
the
court
of
tennessee,
while
the
state
is
getting
ready
to
hold
an
election,
to
require
the
state
to
comply
with
its
constitution?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
mr.
glasgow,
that
tennessee
could
tomorrow
repeal
this
constitutional
provision
that
affords
the
core
of
this
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
as
long
as
it's
their,
is
it
to
be
ignored?
what
does
it
mean?
why
is
it
--
i
don't
follow
that.
is
there
now,
it
means
something,
are
you
complying
with
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
it's
still
there.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
it
gives
to
a
citizen
in
the
great
county
the
right
no
to
have
his
vote
or
read
down
in
shelby
county
in
memphis
not
to
have
his
vote
diluted
by
somebody
out
in
the
mountains,
doesn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
is
there
any
case
in
tennessee
that
holds
this
constitutional
provision
does
not
mean
that
tennessee
must
reapportion
every
10
years
as
its
words
say?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
court
below,
the
three-judge
court
here
said
that
on
the
affirmance
of
this
bill,
as
i
read
it,
that
a
discrimination
was
being
practiced,
but
they
couldn't
do
anything
about
it
for
want
of
power,
isn't
that
what
they
said?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
isn't
that
substantial
also
kidd
chambers
or
kidd
--
the
kidd
case,
not
the
ground
of
it
also?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
your
argument
is
right
as
it
appeared
to
me
this
bill
a
while
ago
when
you
said
that
the
state
legislator
is
competent
to
determine
the
election
and
competency
qualification
of
its
own
members.
if
that's
right,
then
nothing
that
could
happen
toward
the
future
compliance
with
the
statute
would
in
anyway
under
mind
the
validity
of
the
present
legislature
nor
in
anyway
affect
the
validity
of
the
laws
it
had
enacted
since
1911.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
well
then
--
the
how
it
couldn't
be
true
that
if
it
were
now
held
that
tennessee,
in
order
to
accord
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
its
citizens,
must
comply
with
its
constitutional
provision.
how
could
it
then
be
said
that
this
would
leave
tennessee
without
a
present
legislature
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
or
undermine
the
validity
of
the
laws
it
had
been
enacted
since
1911?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that
couldn't
be
true
could
it
or
couldn't,
mr.
glasgow,
if
your
argument
is
sound
that
the
legislature
is
competent
to
determine
the
election
and
qualification
of
its
own
members
and
they've
done
that
year
--
term
after
term
since
1911.
didn't
--
if
that
argument
is
good,
then
they
were
properly
elected
in
the
past?
isn't
that
true?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
would
that
mean
that
the
courts
couldn't
do
anything
about
the
future
with
respect
to
complying
or
requiring
compliance
with
the
tennessee
constitution?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
i
was
just
seeking
some
information.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
rhyme,
did
i
correct
(inaudible)
you
are
not
here
insisting
that
tennessee
must
carry
out
the
formula
of
its
constitution?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
rhyne,
if
i
might
ask
you
to
help
me
in
this
respect.
if
tennessee
was
rid
of
its
constitutional
provision
had
then
no
systems
for
the
allocation
of
its
legislators,
how
would
they
be
allocated?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
they
absent
this
constitution.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
how
--
no,
no,
no,
no.
how
would
the
99
members
of
the
house
and
the
33
senators
be
allocated
if
there
were
no
constitutional
provision?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
must
tennessee
have
some
system
for
the
allocation
of
its
legislators,
the
district's
accounts.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
if
they
were
rid
of
this
constitution
and
could
do
precisely
the
people
--
this
is
--
what
is
being
done,
would
that
then
come
forth
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
your
view?
would
that
be
a
system
if
they
adopted
as
a
system
what
they
have
now
if
they
could
lawfully,
being
rid
of
the
constitution,
would
that
be
an
adequate
system,
a
proper
choice
of
basis
by
the
people
of
tennessee?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
a
matter
of
fiscal
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you're
speaking
of
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
power.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
oh,
even
if
you
couldn't
tell
them
what
to
do,
does
that
mean
there
isn't
power
to
tell
them
that
what
they
are
doing
is
unlawful?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
wilson,
may
i
ask
you
sir,
do
you
consider
it
to
be
to
use
your
term,
"pressure"
merely
to
say
if
it
is
in
fact,
that
a
certain
system
does
violate
federal
constitutional
rights?
if
you
just
said
that
then
nothing
more,
is
that
a
pressure?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
not
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
what
the
petition
asks?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
there
any
allegation
in
this
complaint
that
the
rule
legislators
vote
as
a
block
or
that
the
city
ones
or
urban
ones
voted
as
a
block?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
that
what
--
mr.
osborne
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
not
that
what
they
did
say
in
kidd
against
mccanless?
the
supreme
court?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
right,
now,
that's
a
matter
of
state
law
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
and
they
don't
take
it
back,
where
do
we
go
from
there?
