i
don't
ask
you

anything,
i'm
just
--
just
asking
you
though
if
--
if
you
would
still
be
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
if
there
was
no
such
guarantee
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
from
the

if
they
are
and
they
say,
now

end
of
the
road
if

take
this
case?
chief
justice
earl

has
your
--
has
your
supreme
court
ever
held,
one
way
or
the
other
concerning
the
validity
of
--
of
this
particular
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
the
question
here
presented
ever
been
fairly
presented
to
the
supreme

chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
--
was
the
question
was

earl
warren
but
it
is
now
before
us,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

did
you

deal
with
it?

no.

earl
warren
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.

that
isn't
the
question
i
asked
at
all.
i
asked
you,
what
representation
the
rural
counties
had
in
your
legislature
and
what
representation
the
urban
counties
and
you
said
your
associates.
the
attorney
general
would
supply
that
information
to
it.
it
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
that
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
ask
you
what
the
population
was.
you've
given
us
that
now,
approximately
two
thirds
rural.
now,
how
much
representation
do
the
rural
counties
have
in
your
legislature
and
how
much
representation
do
the
urban
counties
have?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
now
how
is
the
population
divided
between
urban
and
rural
owner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
that's
the
answer
of
my
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
osborne.

justice
earl
warren
