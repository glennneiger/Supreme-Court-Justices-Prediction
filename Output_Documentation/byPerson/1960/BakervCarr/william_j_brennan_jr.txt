well,
let
me
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.

isn't
that
--
is
that
entirely
true?
certainly
some
state
supreme

say
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--
the
supreme
court
in
new
jersey
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
other

also
have
dealt
with
this

haven't
they
and
they
--

stated

pretty

mr.

what's
the
record
in

in

instances
where
state
judiciaries
have
intervened
in

in
minnesota,
was
it,
or
a
federal
district
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
what's
the
record
been
of
compliance,
not
necessarily
with
order
but
merely
with
the
suggestion
that
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
was
wrong
and
should
be
corrected?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
wisconsin?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
wisconsin?
that's
not
too
recent
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
has
been
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
are
--
that's
very
inconsistent.
you
already
told
us
that
the
--
while
the
state
constitution
provides
is
fundamentally,
fundamentally
irrelevant
to
your
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
colony
would
--
would
--
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
deviate
it
as
it
was
possible
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
possible
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
would
be
--
the
court
would
be
reapportionment,
would
they
follow
that
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
quite
sure
that
i've
--
perhaps
you
already
said
it
and
i
didn't
catch
it,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
we
reverse
the
district
court,
we
should
make
these
suggestions
as
possible
remedies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you're
not
suggesting
anyway
are
you
that
this
is
the
litany
of
remedies
available
--
to
be
applied
in
every
one
of
these
situations
in
a
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly
before
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
attorney
general,
i
wonder
if
i
could
approach
some
--
the
subject
that
my
brothers
black
and
frankfurter
discussing
with
you
from
a
different
angle,
moore
county
of
rural
county.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
sequatchie
and
i'd
like
to
know
if
that's
correct
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
sequatchie,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
also
rural?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
my
arithmetic
is
any
good,
based
on
more
having
a
voting
population
of
2340,
i
think
these
are
1953
years,
and
sequatchie
about
600
more
or
29104,
it
appears
that
moore
has
a
total
representation
that
senate
and
your
lawyer
house
of
two
and
sequatchie,
600
larger
of
0.63.
in
other
words
moore
apparently
has
about
three
times
the
representation
as
sequatchie
although
it
was
smaller
of
the
two
counties.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
--
how
--
how
could
that
be
justified
if
there
both
rural
counties?
what
would
be
the
factors
which
perhaps
you
might
justify
a
disparity
rural
city,
but
how
do
you
it
among
rural
counties
and
in
fact
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
on
the
same
premise
but
the
same
premise
that
mr.
justice
black's
view
that
this
is
a
justiciable
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
you
said
you're
not
authorized
or
you
couldn't
or
couldn't
be
justified?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you,
what
is
--
what
is
gibson
county?
is
that
a
rural
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
blount?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
blount.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
one.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
that
largely
rural
or
is
that
suburban
or
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
again,
looking
at
these
figures,
gibson
apparently
has
a
population
or
did
have
in1950,
29,832
and
blount,
30,353,
about
an
800
diff
--
or
500
difference
i
guess.
and
gibson
had
a
total
representation
of
five
and
blount
have
only
1.60.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
why
didn't
you
tell
me
that
tennessee
--
where
is
campbell?
what
campbell
county?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
apparently
campbell
has
a
population
of
17,477
or
did
in
1950
and
more
at
that
time,
population
of
2,340.
in
other
words,
about
apparently
160
size,
yet
more
it
had
a
total
representation
of
two
or
has
rather,
is
campbell
a
representation
of
0.76?
one
third
the
representation
over
campbell
was
apparently
six
times
more
population
than
moore.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
call
is
by
the
legislature
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
this
--
i
was
curious,
you
said
there
had
been
what
a
state
wide
referendum
sought
by
the
legislature
whether
the
legislature
should
call.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
do
i
understand?
i
just
don't.
what
is
your
law?
may
the
legislature
convene
a
constitutional
convention
whether
the
people
decide
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
--
your
point
is
that
reapportionment
was
not
included
in
the
call
because
there
was
no
statewide
demand
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
might
--
it
might
be
another
reason
i
suppose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
memphis
may
have
asked
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
sufficient
votes
to
the
legislature
but
really
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
a
journal
would
not
include.
would
it
all
the
offers
of
subjects
to
be
included
on
a
constitutional
convention
call?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
mr.
attorney
general,
why
mislead
the
holding
in
kidd
and
mccanless
that
is
by
your
tennessee's
supreme
court
to
be
that
the
points
you're
now
raising
as
to
the
effect
upon
past
statutes
and
the
life,
would
not
ensue
one
told
of
the
date
of
a
judicial
declaration
of
invalidity
and
then
only
perspectively?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
i'm
speaking
of
your
own
tennessee
supreme
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
means
perspectively
then
nothing
--
in
other
words,
all
these
past
events?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
susceptible
of
that
interpretation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
not
ladder
whether
or
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
means
two
thirds
of
the
99
and
the
lower
house
would
be
--
or
66
might
be
called
rural
and
33
urban,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
upper
house,
22
rural
and
11.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
osborn,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there's
more
here
as
i
understand
it
and
then
equality
between
urban
and
--
and
rural
voter.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
apparently,
inequalities
among
rural
counties,
between
rural
counties
with
the
same
size
and
different
sizes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
fact
--
mr.
osborn,
supposed
--
supposed
this
that
the
apportionment
act
itself
were
declared
unconstitutional.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
my
reading
of
kidd
and
mccanless
as
i
read
it,
as
i
suggested
to
rather
said
all
that
has
said
is
the
current
legislature.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
not
be
validly
constituted
that
not
that
any
of
the
actions
of
earlier
legislatures
would
be
invalid
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
--
and
suppose
it's
not
limited
but
then
your
tennessee
supreme
court
would
set
while
the
action
of
the
federal
courts
invalidating
the
apportionment
act,
does
have
the
effect
invalidating
the
current
legislature.
would
that
be
a
matter
of
state
law
or
would
that
be
something
which
we
could
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
you're
telling
is
then
is
if
the
1901
act
is
invalidated,
we
ought
to
count
on
the
existing
and
as
the
legislatives
then
enacting
an
apportionment
act
which
does
comply
with
the,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
i
take
it
and
you're
saying
that
if
someone
is
going
to
challenge
that
on
the
ground
that
the
legislature
itself
to
invalid
body,
let's
wait
till
that
happens.
