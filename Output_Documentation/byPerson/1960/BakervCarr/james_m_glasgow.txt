mr.
james
m.
glasgow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
middle
district
of
tennessee,
dismissing
a
complaint
which
was
filed
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
the
reapportionment
of
general
assembly
districts
within
the
state.
there
are
certain
observations
in
regard
to
the
pleadings
which
i
think
are
pertinent
and
should
be
discussed
at
the
outset.
first
of
all,
the
11
plaintiffs
who
bring
this
suit
alleged
that
they
do
so,
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
voters
of
tennessee.
they
also
alleged
that
they
bring
it
as
a
class
action
in
the
sense
that
they
say
that
they
have
been
discriminated
against
because
their
votes
count
less
than
those
of
their
country
cousins.
they
alleged
further
that
they're
entitled
to
maintain
this
suit
as
a
voting
rights
case.
the
defendants
on
the
other
hand
are
certain
state
administrative
and
judicial
officials.
the
truth
of
the
situation
is
in
regard
to
those
defendants
and
i
don't
understand
that
there
are
any
substantial
allegations
to
the
contrary.
these
defendants
have
very
little
to
do
with
what
the
legislature
may
ultimately
do
with
regard
to
this
issue
of
reapportionment.
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
they
do
have
certain
functions
to
perform
in
regard
to
this
proposition
of
elections.
but
in
either
event,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
a
lack
of
parties
here
to
properly
present
this
question.
we
-–
there's
no
county
election
commission
that's
brought
before
the
court
in
regard
to
holding
elections.
the
general
assembly
wasn't
attempted
and
it's
brought
before
the
court
in
regard
to
the
reapportioning
of
the
state.
we
think
that
in
view
of
the
situation
in
regard
to
these
parties
that
the
complaint
is
bad.
now,
very
rapidly,
i
want
to
summarize
the
allegations
in
regard
to
the
--
what
they
predicate
their
claim
upon.
first
of
all,
they
say
that
the
1901
act
apportioning
the
state
of
tennessee
is
unconstitutional
because
it
interferes
with
their
voting
rights
under
the
equal
protection
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
have
heard
that
their
voting
rights
have
been
debased.
they
claim
that
as
a
result
of
the
tennessee
apportionment
formula
in
the
constitution
that
they
are
entitled
to
have
the
courts
examine
this
question
and
find
and
declare
that
those
provisions
are
mandatory
and
self-executions.
now,
they
make
these
general
affirmance
in
regard
to
the
provisions
being
mandatory
and
being
self-executing
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
those
are
nothing
more
than
a
–
the
conclusions
of
the
pleading.
they
also
assert
that
the
1901
apportionment
statute
became
obsolete
in
1911
and
therefore
it
would
become
unconstitutional.
they
set
--
also
assert
that
the
failure
to
reapportion
has
been
purposely
and
systematically
handled
by
the
legislature
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
a
denial
of
their
rights.
they
point
to
population
growths
and
shifts
and
use
the
census
figures
in
order
to
support
their
contentions.
they
charged
that
there's
a
discrimination
in
the
allocation
and
distribution
of
state
aid
funds,
particularly
with
reference
to
gasoline
taxes
and
the
general
education
appropriations.
they
imply
that
there
would
be
a
different
distribution.
in
the
event,
the
court
grants
them
relief.
it
held
substantially
three
prayers
in
their
complaint.
the
first
one
is
that
the
apportionment
statutes
be
declared
unconstitutional.
then
they
say
that
these
appellees
should
be
enjoined
from
doing
various
the
acts
which
they
do
in
regard
to
elections.
and
they
should
not
do
any
of
those
things
until
the
state
is
reapportioned
in
--
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
formula.
then
they
finally
assert
that
the
appellees
should
be
directed
to
hold
a
next
election
at
large,
for
the
members
of
the
general
assembly
in
tennessee.
now,
in
the
district
court,
the
complaint
was
met
with
a
motion
to
dismiss.
it
was
–-
the
motion
to
dismiss
is
on
three
grounds.
first
of
all
that
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
secondly,
the
complaint
fails
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
maybe
granted
and
third,
that
there
was
a
failure
to
join
indispensable
parties.
after
the
case
was
heard,
a
number
of
intervenors
were
permitted
to
come
into
the
case
including
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
nashville
and
the
cities
of
knoxville
and
chattanooga.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
either
on
account
of
elect
–
of
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
or
the
inappropriateness
of
the
subject
matter,
it
felt
that
it
was
bound
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
relied
upon
colegrove
versus
green
and
the
other
cases
which
have
been
eluded
to.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
may
it
please
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday
afternoon
when
the
recess
occurred,
i
was
about
to
discuss
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court.
the
opinion
maybe
found
at
page
214
of
the
record.
the
three-judge
court
announced
the
following
rule
as
applicable
and
decisive
of
the
case
in
that
court.
from
a
review
of
these
decisions,
referring
to
the
decisions
on
page
216
of
the
opinion,
the
court
said
that,
“the
federal
courts
whether
from
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
or
from
the
inappropriateness
of
the
subject
matter
for
judicial
consideration
will
not
intervene
in
cases
of
this
type
to
compel
legislative
reapportionment."
the
court
thought
it
was
highly
significant
that
the
question
of
reapportionment
had
been
before
the
state
court
in
the
case
of
kidd
versus
mccanless
and
the
court
points
out
that
it
is
significant
that
the
case
of
kidd
versus
mccanless
involved
the
identical
apportionment
statutes
and
the
identical
state
of
facts
as
confronted
the
three-judge
court.
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
in
view
of
kidd
versus
mccanless
and
other
opinions
from
this
court,
it
did
not
think
that
question
could
be
adjudicated
in
that
court
as
--
or
was
appropriate
for
judicial
relief.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
kidd
versus
mccanless
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
no,
sir.
if
--
that
wasn't
appealed
to
this
court
in
that
case
and
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
authority
of
colegrove
versus
green
and
anderson
versus
jordan.
now,
the
court
also
points
out
that
the
suggested
remedies
that
had
been
asked
for
in
the
complaint
are
indirect
in
the
sense
that
they
are
not
sought
directly
against
the
legislature
of
tennessee
and
this
is
a
lawsuit
involving
state
administrative
and
judicial
officers.
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
it
could
--
had
no
authority
to
order
an
election
at
large
as
prayed
for
in
the
complaint
and
that
if
it
were
to
do
so,
it
would
lead
to
serious
geographical
inequalities
and
other
discriminations
probably
--
probably
to
a
greater
extent
than
those
already
existing.
the
court
then
said
that
the
constitution
of
the
state
vested
the
duty
of
making
an
enumeration
of
voters
squarely
in
the
hands
of
the
state
legislature
and
concluded
by
pointing
out
that
this
would
amount
to
nothing
more
than
a
kind
of
judicial
legislation
and
an
unwarranted
intrusion
into
the
political
affairs
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
general
wilson
and
i
have
divided
the
issues
to
be
argued
here
this
afternoon
and
i
will
deal
primarily
with
the
questions
of
state
law
which
are
involved,
which
we
think
are
important
and
which
we
think
are
decisive
of
the
question
and
that
the
court
need
not
reach
the
alleged
federal
questions.
if
my
time
permits,
i
will
also
discuss
the
issue
of
justiciability
and
general
wilson
will
go
into
the
questions
of
discrimination
and
the
proposed
remedies.
briefly,
i
would
summarize
our
contentions
at
this
point
and
point
out
that
we
think
that
state
law
is
decisive
of
this
lawsuit
that
the
issues
here
are
not
justiciable
as
between
the
parties,
that
the
subject
--
there
is
--
there
are
no
adverse
interests,
that
the
suit
is
unauthorized
under
the
--
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
subject
matter
generally
is
not
justiciable.
we
insist
that
the
federal
courts
lacked
jurisdiction
of
the
question
and
that
reapportionment
is
a
political
or
a
legislative
question.
we
think
that
the
court
has
already
announced
principles
which
decide
the
issues
in
this
case.
we
further
insist
that
there
is
no
discrimination
and
that
the
1901
statute
is
valid
in
constitution.
what
is
the
issue
in
this
case?
is
it
voting
rights
or
is
it
a
republican
form
of
government?
if
i
understand
the
--
the
proposition
stated
in
the
argument
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
i
believe
it's
on
page
17,
in
the
opening
sentence
he
said
the
issue
involves
the
proposition
of
fair
representation
in
the
legislative
halls.
it's
one
thing
to
insist
upon
voting
rights,
we
think.
we
think
that
it's
quite
another
thing
to
insist
upon
fair
representation
and
a
republican
form
of
government.
in
turning
to
the
state
law
and
we
are
aware
of
the
cases
which
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
loath,
i
believe
the
term
is,
to
decide
questions
of
state
law.
the
court
has
also
said
that
it
doesn't
like
to
venture
into
the
delicate
field
of
faith
of
federal
and
state
relationships.
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
discuss
for
a
few
moments,
the
tennessee
constitutional
provisions.
yesterday,
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
that
article
i,
section
5
of
the
tennessee
constitution,
guarantees
the
right
of
suffrage
and
also
elections
shall
be
free
and
equal.
we
insist
that
article
iv
of
the
constitution
and
not
article
i,
section
5,
controls
the
right
to
vote
in
the
state
and
the
right
here
certainly
is
a
state
right
because
it
involves
the
election
of
state
officers.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
we
think
so,
if
your
honor
please?
we
think
that
in
view
of
the
--
this
court's
opinions
in
the
various
cases
such
as
smiley
versus
holm,
carroll
versus
becker,
wood
versus
broom
and
others
that
there
is
a
federal
right
that
is
guaranteed
to
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
to
vote
for
a
congressman
under
the
federal
constitution.
on
the
other
hand,
the
federal
constitution
is
silent
on
the
question
of
state
legislatures
and
state
representation.
article
i,
section
5
of
our
constitution,
which
is
in
the
bill
of
rights,
is
very
brief
and
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
read
the
first
sentence.
“the
elections
shall
be
free
and
equal
and
the
right
of
suffrage,
as
here
and
after
declared,
shall
never
be
denied
to
any
person
entitled
thereto,
except
upon
a
conviction
by
a
jury
of
some
infamous
crime
previously
ascertained
and
declared
below
and
judgment
thereon
by
court
of
competent
jurisdiction.
now,
the
words
that
were
not
pointed
out
to
the
court
yesterday
and
i'm
sure
that
was
by
inadvertence,
are
the
words
“here
and
after
declared”
and
that
we
insist
the
--
refers
to
article
iv,
section
1
of
our
constitution
which
prescribes
then
of
the
voting
qualifications
and
defines
the
right
to
vote.
now,
every
citizen
or
a
person
in
tennessee
who
is
a
age
of
21
years,
who
has
been
a
resident
of
the
state
for
12
months
and
who
has
resided
in
his
county
for
3
months,
is
guaranteed
the
right
to
vote
under
article
iv,
section
1.
now,
none
of
these
appellants
insist
that
they
have
been
denied
access
to
the
ballot
box.
none
of
these
appellants
insist
that
they
haven't
been
permitted
to
cast
their
votes
in
free
and
equal
elections.
none,
except
insofar
as
article
i,
section
5
is
concerned,
none
of
them
insist
that
their
votes
have
not
been
counted.
and
we
insist,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
in
considering
what
their
rights
are
in
regard
to
the
right
of
suffrage
if
they
meet
these
qualifications
and
they
participate
in
elections,
that
is
all
that
they're
entitled
to
by
way
of
a
right
to
vote
under
the
state
constitution.
i
would
also
point
out
that
we
have
a
provision
in
our
constitution
which
is
similar
to
the
provision
in
the
federal
constitution
that
the
general
assembly
shall
be
the
judges
of
the
qualifications
of
its
members
and
also
of
their
election.
now,
the
federal
cases
i
think
are
very
clear
that
that
is
an
exclusive
function
of
the
legislative
body.
that
is
that
body
exclusively
determines
what
the
qualifications
of
its
members
may
be.
it
also
exclusively
determines
what
--
whether
or
not
a
member
of
congress
has
been
duly
elected
for
example
and
in
our
state,
whether
or
not
a
member
of
the
legislature
has
been
duly
elected
and
in
the
case
of
state
versus
shumate
in
172
tennessee
at
451,
the
court
said
that
"it
would
not
enter
into
any
kind
of
judgment
or
would
not
enter
in
any
kind
of
what
judgment,
it
would
not
do
anything
about
enforcing
that
type
of
right.
that
anything
that
arose
in
regard
to
the
qualifications
of
the
members
of
the
general
assembly
was
something
that
the
house
concerned
would
have
to
dispose
of.”
now,
we
insist
that
the
courts
of
tennessee
under
that
provision
would
not
have
any
authority
whatsoever
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
member
of
the
general
assembly
had
been
duly
elected.
we
think
that's
a
question
that
must
be
determined
under
the
constitution
by
the
house
itself.
now,
what
is
the
significance
of
that
proposition?
to
us
it
simply
means
this,
that
if
there
is
any
question
here
concerning
the
electoral
process
in
the
state
in
--
with
reference
to
the
election
of
members
of
the
general
assembly,
then
it
must
follow
that
any
question
which
arises
in
regard
to
that
election
must
be
decided
by
the
legislature
itself
and
the
courts
should
not
intrude
upon
the
prerogatives
of
the
legislature.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
i
take
it
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
question
of
apportionment.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
now,
in
that
regard,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
disagree
with
our
opponents
as
to
the
effect
of
the
tennessee
constitutional
apportionment
provisions.
we
think
that
the
question
is
probably
been
laid
to
rest
in
kidd
versus
mccanless
and
that
being
true,
we
think
that
what
the
tennessee
court
has,
at
least
by
implication,
said
in
regard
to
those
provisions,
is
binding
in
this
court
and
on
the
federal
courts
generally.
and
as
was
pointed
out
from
the
bench
here
yesterday,
i
think
there
are
reported
decisions
of
this
court
where
it
--
it's
been
pointed
out
that
although
there
maybe
a
violation
of
a
state
constitutional
provision,
that
question
must
be
addressed
exclusively
to
the
state
court
and
not
the
federal
courts.
now,
article
ii,
section
1
of
our
constitution,
creates
three
branches
of
government;
the
executive,
judicial
and
the
legislative.
the
second
section
of
our
constitution
provides
that,
“no
member
of
either
department
shall
exercise
the
functions
of
the
other.”
in
other
words,
they
must
be
kept
separate.
our
court
has
adhered
to
that
principle
and
in
the
case
of
richardson
versus
young,
122
tennessee
471,
the
court
discusses
the
proposition
in
detail.
there,
the
court
said
that
the
courts
are
not
to
perform
legislative
functions.
now,
the
three
apportionment
provisions
of
our
constitution
commence
immediately
after
section
2
and
they're
contained
in
article
ii,
sections
3
through
6
inclusive.
section
3
provides
that
the
general
--
that
the
general
assembly
shall
be
constituted
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
senate.
section
4
provides
for
an
enumeration
of
voters
and
apportionment
of
representatives
within
every
subsequent
term
of
10
years.
section
5
provides
for
apportionment
among
the
counties
or
house
districts
according
to
qualified
voters
not
to
exceed
the
number
of
99.
section
6
provides
that
the
number
of
senators
also
to
be
apportioned
shall
never
exceed
one-third
of
the
number
in
the
house
and
finally,
no
county
maybe
divided
in
creating
those
districts.
now,
under
the
present
system
of
tenne
--
in
tennessee,
the
house
of
representatives
is
composed
of
99
members
and
the
state
senate
is
composed
of
33.
now,
the
appellants
argue
very
strenuously
that
these
provisions
in
the
tennessee
constitution
are
mandatory,
hence,
self-executed.
they
insist
that
the
1901
apportionment
statute
became
obsolete
and
invalid
in
1911
because
an
enumeration
was
not
made
within
the
10-year
period
as
required
by
these
provisions.
i
will
discuss
kidd
versus
mccanless
in
that
respect
in
detail
in
a
few
moments,
but
if
this
point,
suffice
it
to
say,
that
we
disagree
with
their
construction
and
that
there
are
a
number
of
precedents
in
the
state
law
or
state
decisions
which
hold
contrary
to
their
insistence.
the
appellants
also
insist
that
in
regard
to
these
provisions,
there
is
a
measurable
discrimination.
these
arguments
of
course
we
reject
as
being
unsound.
we
think
that
the
court
is
being
asked
to
usurp
legislative
functions
and
that
the
courts
should
assume
a
dominant
role
and
make
this
legislature
subservient
to
the
judicial
process,
we
think
that
falls
squarely
in
teeth
with
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
now,
again
we
assert
that
apportionment
statutes
as
we
have
them
in
tennessee
are
valid
and
as
was
suggested
here
yesterday,
if
we
disregard
the
tennessee
constitutional
provisions
for
the
purpose
of
argument,
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
the
state
legislature
had
the
authority
to
enact
an
apportionment
statute.
our
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
the
legislature
has
plenary
authority
except
as
inhibited
by
the
state
constitution.
and
we
insist
that
the
legislature
of
tennessee
certainly
had
a
right
to
pass
an
apportionment
statute
in
the
absence
of
any
constitutional
provision.
the
appellants
also
insist
that
there
has
been
gross
discrimination
in
regard
to
the
distribution
of
state
revenues
and
particularly
in
regard
to
general
education
appropriations
and
the
rural
roads
allocations.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
on
page
209
of
the
records
there
appears
what
we
considered
to
be
an
interesting
answer
to
those
charges.
it's
a
very
brief
statement
that
was
filed
by
the
former
solicitor
general
in
this
cause.
one
would
think
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
yes
sir.
one
would
think
that
the
cities
and
the
rural
legislators
or
the
city
legislators
and
the
rural
legislators
are
constantly
at
each
others
throats
and
that
the
general
education
bills
are
always
passed
over
the
opposition
of
the
city
legislators
and
that
the
gasoline
tax
distribution
was
made
over
their
opposition,
but
these
--
this
insert
indicates
that
chapter
14
of
the
public
acts
of
1959
which
is
a
general
appropriations
law
and
is
specially
pleaded
in
this
case,
the
act
was
passed
by
the
house
by
a
vote
of
81
"aye's"
11
"no's".
the
11
no's
were
all
by
representatives
from
rural
counties.
another
--
i
beg
the
court's
pardon
that
is
the
rural
roads
act
of
1955.
the
general
education
law
of
1950
--
59
was
passed
for
the
senate
by
a
unanimous
vote
of
33
aye's.
in
the
house
of
representatives
there
were
91
"aye's"
and
6
"no's".
now
we
think
that
that
is
an
answer
to
some
of
these
charges
of
discrimination
with
reference
to
the
distribution
and
allocation
of
tax
funds.
and
certainly
the
logic
of
the
proposition
is
that
that
must
be
an
exclusively
governmental
function
to
be
handled
entirely
by
the
legislature.
it's
just
as
important
that
the
under
populated
rural
counties
have
educational
systems
that
are
financed
adequately
as
it
is
to
have
them
financed
adequately
in
the
larger
cities.
the
record
also
contains
the
case
of
kidd
versus
mccanless,
it's
at
page
59
in
the
record.
that
case,
as
found
by
the
district
court,
involved
the
identical
facts
and
the
identical
statutes.
in
that
case
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
rejected
the
contention
that
the
1901
apportionment
statute
became
invalid
in
1911.
now,
we
insist,
may
it
please
the
court
that
that
is
tantamount
to
holding
that
those
provisions
are
not
self-executing
and
that
they're
not
mandatory.
if
they
were,
the
court
could
not
have
found
that
the
act
did
not
expire
in
1911,
so
we
think
that
the
doctrine
of
the
kidd
case
as
decided
in
the
state
court
has
the
effect
of
going
against
what
they
insist
is
basic
in
this
lawsuit
and
that
is
that
those
provisions
are
mandatory
and
self-executing.
now,
the
chancellor
in
the
court
below
in
kidd
versus
mccanless
said
--
overruled
the
demurrer
that
was
filed
to
the
billing
chancellery
and
held
that
the
statute
was
invalid.
he
then
fell
back
on
the
de
facto
doctrine
and
said
that
all
of
the
acts
which
had
been
done
by
the
legislative
body
were
valid
as
the
de
facto
acts.
the
court
quotes
at
length
from
the
chancellor's
opinion
on
page
62
of
the
record.
then
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
de
facto
doctrine
could
not
apply
because
once
the
--
the
legislature
was
declared
a
de
facto
body,
then
he
would
have
no
authority
whatsoever
to
act.
and
if
it
had
no
authority
to
act,
we
in
substance
would
have
no
legislature
in
tennessee.
that
being
true,
the
court
finally
declared
that
the
ultimate
result
of
holding
this
act
unconstitutional
by
reason
of
the
lapse
of
time
would
be
to
deprive
us
of
the
present
legislature
and
the
means
of
electing
a
new
one
and
ultimately
bring
about
the
destruction
of
the
state
itself.
we
submit,
may
it
please
the
court
that
in
view
of
the
kidd
case
that
the
arguments
--
that
the
tennessee
apportionment
provisions
in
the
constitution
are
self-executing
and
mandatory
are
unsound.
now,
what
was
the
effect
of
this
court's
dismissal
of
the
appeal?
same
issues
were
involved,
same
statutes
were
involved
and
we
think
that
the
force
and
effect
of
this
court's
dismissal
of
the
appeal
because
if
there
are
--
were
federal
questions
then
or
federal
questions
now,
there
certainly
were
questions
then.
we
think
the
force
and
effect
of
that
was
to
say
that
there
was
no
substantial
federal
question
and
further
that
the
grounds
which
the
state
court
placed
its
judgment
upon
was
adequate
to
support
the
judgment.
in
the
case
of
maxey
versus
powers
in
117
tenn.
381,
the
court
was
confronted
with
an
analogous
situation
and
it's
a
case
which
i
bring
to
the
court's
attention
merely
to
indicate
that
this
is
not
something
that
we
have
devised
here
on
a
moment's
notice
in
the
way
of
an
argument.
but
there,
our
court
was
confronted
with
construing
another
provision
of
our
constitution
regarding
the
laying
out
of
civil
districts
and
counties.
and
there,
the
redistricting
act
was
challenged
as
it
is
here
and
the
court
said
that
that
was
a
political
question
and
it
being
a
political
question
it
was
the
type
that
the
court
could
not
go
into.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
perhaps
that's
a
better
statement,
sir.
we
think
that
the
effect
of
the
arguments
in
regard
to
the
state
law
in
this
proposition
is
to
inject
this
court
into
political
controversies
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
for
the
federal
judiciary
to
take
over
the
state
political
situation.
we
think
that
that
would
be
abhorrent
to
our
system
of
government.
we
don't
think
that
the
basic
law
of
our
state
should
be
disregarded
and
on
one
hand
and
then
the
appellants
say,
“we'll
take
this
and
leave
something
else.”
we
--
we
think
that
they
should
be
consistent
throughout.
we
think
that
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
courts
getting
into
this
situation
would
be
to
put
the
federal
judiciary
in
the
--
the
situation
of
being
on
a
primrose
path
in
federal
state
relations.
i
come
now
to
the
issue
of
justiciability
and
as
we
understand
the
rule
under
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
united
states
constitution,
that
is
always
an
issue
in
every
law
suit.
is
a
case
or
controversy
presented
within
the
meaning
of
those
provisions?
we
insist
that
the
appellants
have
the
same
interest
in
apportionment
in
tennessee
as
all
other
voters
and
citizens.
they
seek
to
secure
to
themselves
representation
which
they
say
would
be
fairer
than
what
we
now
have.
in
doing
so,
they
have
the
same
interest
as
all
other
citizens
in
a
republican
form
of
government.
therefore,
we
insist
that
the
complaint
does
not
allege
a
private
wrong
and
we
further
insist
that
the
--
instead
of
accepting
the
allegations
as
pleaded
in
the
complaint
that
the
court
should
look
behind
those
allegations
and
see
exactly
what
they're
pointed
to.
the
substance
of
the
matter
is
that
they
have
not
suffered
an
injury
which
is
direct.
further,
the
appellees
have
no
real
official
interest
in
reapportionment
which
are
different
for
most
other
state
officials.
and
we
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
55
of
our
brief,
appendix
(a)
where
we
go
into
the
question
in
some
detail
as
to
what
the
interest
of
these
appellees
maybe
in
regard
to
the
electoral
system
in
tennessee.
first
of
all,
the
board
of
elections
is
composed
of
three
men
who
have
no
other
duty
than
to
appoint
the
county
election
commissioners.
they
have
no
authority
on
them,
they
can't
dismiss
them,
they
can
do
nothing
more
than
appoint
them.
they
are
directed
by
statute
to
meet
once
a
year.
next,
the
attorney
general
is
--
made
a
party
here
and
it
is
said
that
he
has
certain
duties
in
regard
to
the
election
of
--
of
state
legislators.
we
reject
the
idea
that
he
has
anymore
duty
in
that
regard
than
he
does
advising
any
other
state
officials.
we
think
that's
all
he
does.
the
idea
that
he
does
more
is
not
founded
in
--
in
our
statutes.
that
being
true,
certainly,
he
could
have
no
official
entries
in
reappointment
statutes
as
such.
he
is
required
under
our
statutes
to
be
made
a
party
in
the
event
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
disabled.
i
take
it,
that's
the
primary
reason
that
he
was
made
a
party
below.
as
to
the
coordinator
of
elections,
he
has
various
minor
duties
in
regard
to
them
such
as
set
out
here
on
pages
58
and
59.
he
has
no
supervision
over
the
election,
he
cannot
control
the
election,
he
does
not
conduct
it.
the
secretary
of
state
receives
certificates
from
the
county
election
commissioners
as
to
the
results
that
--
of
the
elections
in
those
counties.
now,
we
insist
that
that
is
too
remote
in
the
electoral
process
to
be
the
basis
of
an
injunction
against
these
officials
to
require
them
to
hold
an
election
at
large
or
to
withhold
--
conducting
an
election
until
the
general
assembly
is
appointed,
i
mean
apportioned.
now,
that
being
true
in
regard
to
their
interests,
we
fail
to
see
how
they
have
any
interest
whatever
that
reaches
to
the
critical
issue
of
apportionment.
next,
we
insist
that
the
--
this
is
an
unauthorized
suit
against
the
state
because
the
purpose
is
to
compel
the
legislature
to
act,
not
to
strike
down
alone
a
statute
which
it
enacted
many
years
ago,
but
the
purpose
of
--
of
this
suit
goes
further
than
that,
much
further.
the
purpose
is
to
compel
the
legislature
to
reapportion
the
state
of
tennessee
and
in
doing
that,
we
think
that
that
is
asked
that
the
courts
take
over
the
electoral
system
and
direct
the
legislature
to
do
something
which
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
courts.
article
i,
section
17
of
our
constitution
inhibit
suits
against
the
state
unless
they
have
been
authorized
by
the
general
assembly.
certainly,
the
general
assembly
has
not
authorized
a
suit
of
this
character.
as
was
pointed
out
in
petty
versus
tennessee
missouri
bridge
commission,
the
doctrine
of
governmental
immunity
--
immunity
is
strictly
applied
in
tennessee.
now,
that
being
true,
we
insist
that
these
appellants
as
citizens
of
tennessee
have
no
standing
whereby
they
can
maintain
a
suit
and
a
citizen
cannot
sue
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
this
court
has
so
held
on
a
number
of
occasions.
finally,
i
would
suggest
that
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
which
general
wilson
will
discuss
in
some
detail
is
such
that
the
courts
should
not
entertain
this
kind
of
a
complaint
and
we
think
that
the
court
below
was
eminently
correct
in
what
it
did.
the
issues
are
political
and
they
go
to
the
part
of
a
republican
form
of
government.
we
think
that
reapportionment
is
a
legislative
question
and
if
the
court
is
without
power
to
exercise
any
kind
of
equitable
power
with
--
in
regard
to
this
kind
of
a
question.
if
the
court
will
not
exercise
its
equity
power,
then
we
insist
that
is
not
a
proper
case
for
a
declaratory
judgment
because
the
declaratory
judgment
statutes
are
procedural
only
and
that
it
would
be
improper
to
make
a
declaration
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
grant
equitable
relief.
in
conclusion,
i
would
suggest
that
i
think
that
it
would
be
improper
for
the
courts
to
take
over
the
political
affairs
of
the
states.
i
think
that
in
this
field
of
federal
and
state
relationships,
it
is
necessary
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
and
their
political
affairs
be
administered
by
the
states.
i
think
whatever
a
state
court
may
say
or
the
state's
highest
court
may
say
about
its
own
constitution
is
binding
here
if
it's
relevant
at
all
in
this
case.
the
effect
of
the
court's
going
into
this
questions,
i
suggest
would
be
to
open
up
many
new
fields
of
litigation
and
that
the
court
then
be
called
upon
to
redistrict
the
various
municipalities
throughout
the
country
so
that
the
people
within
the
cities
would
themselves
have
a
fair
representation
as
is
contended
for
here
on
questions
for
municipals
annexation
will
the
voters
be
given
an
opportunity
to
express
themselves?
we
respectfully
insist
that
all
of
those
questions
may
arise
in
the
future.
if
the
court
goes
into
this
area
and
we
think
that
the
court
should
reject
such
a
notion.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
i
think
that
the
constitution
could
be
amended
and
those
provisions
eliminated,
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
in
--
in
that
sense,
no
sir.
it
hasn't
been
complied
with
in
regard
to
the
reapportioning
of
the
legislature
since
1901.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
yes
sir.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
it
means
that
because
i
think
that
the
case
of
kidd
versus
mccanless
shows
that
our
court
doesn't
attach
that
significance
to
those
provisions.
in
other
words,
if
i
go
back
to
the
argument
that
if
--
as
our
court
said,
the
reapportionment
statute
did
not
become
obsolete,
in
1911
then
those
provisions
can
be
neither
mandatory
nor
self-executing.
now,
that
--
that's
uncharacteristic
of
many
state
constitutions
or
many
provisions
in
state
constitutions.
in
colegrove
versus
green,
there
are
a
number
of
situations
which
are
cited
which
are
not
enforceable
in
the
courts
in
regard
to
state
constitutional
provisions.
and
we
think
that
whatever
the
state
courts
say
about
those
things
are
controlling
and
we
rely
upon
the
classic
statement
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
when
he
said
that
the
--
a
state
court's
construction
of
its
own
constitution
is
decisive
and
controlling
everywhere.
and
we
think
that
that
is
the
situation
with
which
this
court
is
confronted
on
the
basis
of
the
kidd
case.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
the
only
case
that
there
is
in
tennessee,
if
your
honor
please,
is
kidd
versus
mccanless.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
that's
true,
they
said
that.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
the
ground
of
a
kidd
case
as
i
read
it
is
that
the
lower
court
held
the
act
unconstitutional
and
the
supreme
court
said
that
the
trial
court
erred
in
holding
it
unconstitutional
because
to
do
so
wound
in
effect
place
tennessee
without
a
state
legislature.
there
--
there
would
be
the
de
facto
doctrine
which
the
chancellor
said
was
applicable.
the
supreme
court
rejected
and
said
that
the
effect
of
adapting
the
de
facto
doctrine
would
be
to
abolish
the
legislature.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
well,
i
--
i
think
that
that's
true,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
well
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
in
regard
to
the
polarity
to
the
validity
of
the
laws,
that
have
been
acted
--
enacted
since
1911,
i
daresay
that
the
courts
would
not
invalidate
those
laws,
but
if
the
argument
which
is
advanced
here
is
correct
that
the
legislature
or
the
apportionment
provisions
expired
in
1911,
then
it
must
be
that
there
--
everything
that's
been
done
since
1911,
is
invalid.
i
--
i
--
as
a
matter
of
theory,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
any
other
way
and
i
think
that
was
the
problem
that
was
in
the
mind
of
the
tennessee
court.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
that's
true.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
well,
it's
our
insistence,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
that
regard
that
the
question
is
a
political
question.
it's
one
of
that
the
courts
have
refused
from
--
for
many,
many
years
to
adjudicate
and
that
being
true,
it's
not
a
proper
area
for
the
judiciary
and
we
--
we
insist
and
general
wilson
will
go
into
the
proposition
of
the
equal
protection
provision
that
the
equal
protection
provision
has
no
application
in
this
case.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
i'm
afraid
i
haven't
been
as
helpful
as
i
would
like
to
be.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
i
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
if
it
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
if
i
sounded
confident
on
that
score,
if
your
honor
please,
i
intended
to
say
nothing
or
do
nothing
more
than
to
suggest
that
i
--
that
i
doubt
if
the
courts
will
hold
at
anytime
the
--
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
no
--
no,
sir.
i
don't
mean
that.
[laughter]
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
i
haven't
heard
that
argument
made
as
yet,
your
honor
please.
mr.
james
m.
glasgow
thank
you.
