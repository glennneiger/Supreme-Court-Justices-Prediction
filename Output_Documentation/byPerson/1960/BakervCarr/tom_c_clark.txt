did
they
have
any

clark
coming
back
to

i
was

the
fourteenth
amendment

appearing
that
half
of
the
states
have
this

discrimination
that

at
various

would
it
be
within
their
authority
and
power
to
appoint
a
commission
to
go
into
that
and
perhaps
pass
some
general
law,
an
act
of
congress
with
reference
to
this?
