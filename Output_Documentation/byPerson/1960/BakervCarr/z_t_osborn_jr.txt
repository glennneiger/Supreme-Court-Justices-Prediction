mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
honorable
court
in
light
of
the
closing
made,
it
might
well
be
alerted
to
this
that
for
the
first
time
in
60
years,
a
state
legislature
in
tennessee
agreed
to
have
an
enumeration
and
that
that
only
after
this
honorable
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
had
it
not
been
for
that,
the
allegations
made
would
have
been
just
as
literally
true
as
they
were
following
the
1959
legislature.
now,
in
this
case,
we
seek
not
a
declaration
by
this
court
as
to
how
a
state
legislature
should
be
apportioned.
we
do
not
seek
to
obtain
from
this
court
any
action
that
the
courts
have
not
traditionally
granted.
what
we
seek
from
this
court
is
this,
examination
of
an
act
of
a
state
legislature
for
whether
it
complied
with,
the
constitution
of
tennessee
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
we
ask
this
court
to
pass
upon
whether
a
state
legislature
can,
in
the
base
of
certain
rights
that
are
established
and
conferred
by
the
state
constitution,
adopted
now
in
1870
and
following
tennessee's
readmission
to
the
union
upon
its
ratification
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
served
to
guarantee
the
equal
protection
of
rights
that
were
established
by
the
state
as
whether
or
not
a
state
legislature
can
--
by
an
act
destroy
those
rights.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
it
means
that
--
it
--
it
means
that
if
this
court
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
if
it
means
that,
if
your
honors
do
review
this
act
for
its
constitutionality
and
if
you
do
find
that
the
act
of
1901
apportioning
tennessee
in
violation
of
the
constitution
of
tennessee
and
of
the
constitution
of
united
states,
if
you
find
that
that
act
is
invalid,
there
are
certain
things
that
will
follow
in
logic
as
pointed
out
by
this
court
in
smiley
versus
holm
and
in
other
cases.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
right.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
this
is
what
we
say
that
we
are
entitled
to.
if
this
act
of
apportionment
which
was
not
based
upon
an
enumeration,
no
enumeration
was
in
fact
made
which
was
not
based
upon
the
provisions
of
tennessee's
constitution,
but
was
based
upon
some
matter
pulled
out
of
the
air,
not
susceptible
to
any
rationalization.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
when
and
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes,
alright.
and
--
and
now,
i
will
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
i'll
now
explain
why
and
very
briefly
why.
we
do
ask
for
a
declaration
respecting
an
election
at
large
and
a
declaration
respecting
a
constitutional
election.
the
reasoning
in
smiley
versus
holm
is
simply
this,
that
if
a
state
legislature
given
power
to
apportion,
does
not
apportion
then
the
legislature
or
congressional
declaration
--
congressional
delegation
remains
unapportioned
and
at
large.
now,
if
we
have
no
act
of
an
--
of
apportionment,
we
do
have
if
we
have
to
elect
another
legislature,
we
do
have
two
alternatives;
either
to
let
the
legislature
subject
us
to
an
election
at
large,
an
election
of
an
unapportioned
legislature
or
the
court
saying
to
these
defendants
who
hold
our
elections,
"you
may
as
an
alternative
provide
for
an
election
in
compliance
with
the
mathematical
formula
expressed
in
the
constitution
of
tennessee.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
exactly
the
same
provision
in
the
constitution
of
tennessee
for
an
election
at
large
as
there
is
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
for
an
election
of
congressmen
at
large.
the
two
provisions
are
--
are
almost
identical.
this
court
held
that
a
statement
in
the
united
states
constitution
that
the
people
could
choose
congressmen
and
then
could
go
on
and
let
the
congressmen
apportioned
or
legislatures
apportioned.
upon
their
failure,
the
people
still
had
a
right
to
elect
congressmen
and
in
tennessee's
constitution,
the
legislature
is
dependent
upon
the
people.
it
is
to
be
chosen
by
the
people
and
if
the
legislature
should
fail
to
exercise
its
power
to
apportion,
still
the
legislature
would
exist.
and
to
argue
to
the
contrary
is
--
as
the
attorney
general
does
is
to
say
that
the
legislature
somehow
depends
upon
some
act
of
its
own
for
its
existence.
now,
it'd
be
the
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
no,
only
the
terms
which
have
been
by
this
court,
your
--
this
honorable
court
construed
to
mean
and
to
in
effect
provide
for
an
election
at
large.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well,
the
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
it
is
derivative.
we're
--
we're
saying
that
the
same
provision
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
construed
by
this
court
exists
in
the
constitution
of
tennessee
and
is
construed
and
it
would
be
similarly
construed.
now,
we
want
--
we
want
--
in
this
rebuttal
to
--
to
follow
upon
a
trend
suggested
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
which
is
this.
you
never
have
to
reach
the
de
facto
doctrine
with
respect
to
any
prior
act
of
the
legislature.
the
de
facto
doctrine
would
--
would
not
be
applied
by
this
court
or
by
the
court
of
tennessee
or
any
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
the
question
of
seat
--
of
a
seat
in
the
legislature
or
to
the
question
of
whether
there
were
10
invalid
seats
in
that
legislature
or
a
dozen
people
that
were
not
entailed
to
be
there.
commencing
with
the
apology
of
the
parliament
of
king
james,
the
legislatures
have
consistently
been
held
to
be
the
exclusive
judge
of
the
qualification
of
their
members
and
the
de
facto
only
applies,
it's
--
it's
never
applied
to
anyone
except
some
official
elected
to
some
office
and
the
question
then
of
whether
he's
properly
elected
or
whether
his
office
is
properly
created.
the
courts
do
pass
upon
that
but
they
do
not
pass
upon
the
question
of
--
of
a
seat
in
the
legislature.
so,
if
general
wilson
should
be
asked
whether
to
go
ahead
and
execute
this
prisoner
and
he's
smart,
i
know
him
well
enough.
he
would
say
it
once,
"go
ahead
and
execute
the
prisoner.
we
had
an
--
a
law
against
murder
long
before
the
illegal
act
of
1901
unlawfully
apportioned
in
tennessee."
and
he
would
secondly
say
that
the
courts
have
always
rejected
any
attack
upon
an
act
of
the
legislature
based
upon
its
membership.
so,
he
would
--
he
would
--
he
sets
up
--
he
puts
the
ox
in
the
ditch
in
order
to
try
to
get
--
get
him
out
but
he
would
not
be
concerned
with
any
of
those
things
that
he
urges.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee
envisions
a
situation
in
which
the
state
legislature
and
the
united
states
district
court
tie
each
other
and
to
say,
“who
will
make
the
first
move?”
march
of
--
a
considerable
part
of
the
argument
that
the
court
has
so
patiently
heard
has
been
of
that
--
of
that
type.
that
is
this
conjectural
or
speculated
matters.
what
would
happen
then?
now,
we
would
like
on
behalf
of
the
appellants
to
say,
that
we
seek
a
decoration
that
an
act
of
apportionment
which
indirectly
but
very
effectively
gives
some
voters
in
time
as
much
representation
as
others
is
unconstitutional.
we
seek
then,
we
think
that
the
history
of
the
matter
is
that
these
speculations
that
the
legislature
might
say
denies
the
district
court
are
out
of
order.
they're
not
born
out
but
what
actually
has
happened
where
reinforcement
has
been
ordered
or
where
an
active
apportionment
has
been
held
unconstitutional.
and
in
effect,
they
are
a
departure
from
the
judicial
presumption
which
is
that
other
officials
will
follow
the
law
if
the
law
is
laid
down
too.
in
a
substantial
way,
they
slander
the
people
of
tennessee
might
next
elect
to
its
legislature
and
so
we
say
that
the
--
these
matters
that
are
pointed
up,
they're
not
supported
by
a
presumption.
we're
not
entitled
to
presume
that
the
state
legislature
would
if
this
act
of
apportionment
were
struck
down
that
it
would
sit
and
refuse
to
do
anything.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
unless
the
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
--
if
employed
to
come,
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes,
if
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
we
would
try
to
be
here
again
because
as
the
attorney
general
says,
this
is
a
longstanding,
a
continuing
evil
and
the
weakness
in
our
system
of
government.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
he
says
only
rational
differentiations
as
you
have
seen
from
the
questions
asked
for
--
other
of
your
associates,
in
this
particular
apportionment.
no
rational
basis
can
be
discovered.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes
we
would.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
i
have
no
doubted
that
yet
and
yet
--
against
that
you
have
this
your
honor
that
the
rotenberg
had
game
entered,
it
can
never
be
defended
by
someone
who
believes
then
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
and
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
my
conception
being
this
that
if
an
unconstitutional
act
was
placed,
it
is
the
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
the
language
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
suggest
to
the
contrary.
it
says
that,
“no
state
shall
enact
to
its
citizen's
equal
protection
of
law
and
it
specifically
prohibits
an
abridgment
of
the
right
to
vote
for
members
of
the
legislature.”
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
in
that.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well,
i
agree
that
there
may
be
in
equality
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well,
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
it
was
a
club
that
was
organized
in
(inaudible)
and
--
and
that
is
all
that
it
matters
to
it.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
no,
they
could
not
with
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
--
with
good
conscience,
and
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
--
accept
by
rational
basis.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
no,
both
of
us
are
supposed
to
have
the
conscience
provided
for
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
always
they
have
done
that.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
never
has
this
court
failed
--
have
the
courage
to
do
what
its
conscious
mind.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
may
i
answer
and
not
take
too
long
because
i
appreciate
the
--
the
time
of
course
given
to
me.
in
the
first
place,
the
de
facto
doctrine
is
not
as
described
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
and
--
and
the
special
ruling
was
handed
down
by
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
in
kidd
vs
mccanless
on
the
de
facto
doctrine
in
which
they
departed
from
theirs
--
their
earlier
pronouncements.
but
in
--
in
good
legal
logic,
you
actually
never
reach
the
defect
of
doctrine
because
the
constitution
of
united
states,
the
constitution
of
every
state
in
the
union
gives
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
right
of
a
person
sit
in
a
legislature,
the
right
of
individual
person
now
to
sit
in
that
legislature
to
the
legislative
body
itself.
that
is
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well,
the
--
the
--
we're
--
we're
seeking
now
to
the
same
thing
(inaudible)
thing.
we're
saying
an
act
of
apportionment
is
unconstitutional,
not
that
the
legislature
is
unconstitutional.
the
legislature
exists
independently
of
any
of
its
own
acts.
it
is
the
creature
of
the
constitution
and
the
fact
that
the
legislature
passed
an
unlawful
act
of
apportionment,
could
not
destroy
it.
it
has
no
power
to
destroy
itself,
and
none
of
its
acts
would
by
any
court
of
any
of
the
states
be
construed
in
such
basis
as
to
destroy
the
legislature.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
i'm
invoking
really
a
more
basic
doctrine
meant.
let's
take
the
tennessee
legislature.
it
consists
of
20
people
from
the
urban
area,
the
halves.
the
balance
of
the
99
members
comes
probably
what
we
have
called
the
non-urban
communities.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
would
never
examine
an
act
on
the
question
of
its
constitutionality
to
see
whether
people
who
came
from
too
smaller
district
voted
for
or
against
that
act.
i'm
saying
that
their
acts
are
not
subject
to
attack
all
their
thinking.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
they
did
not.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
your
honors
would
review
that.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well,
your
honor
would
--
would
always
review
and
--
the
question
and
the
extent
of
the
affect
of
a
ruling
by
this
honorable
court.
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
has
to
do
is
interpret
its
opinion.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
when
you
have
review
that.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well,
that
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
that's
a
hard
question
and
--
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
no.
but
it
is
--
it
comes
down
of
this,
so
first
it
would
suppose
that
tennessee
supreme
court
would
say,
"well,
since
there
were
probably
apportioned,
there's
been
no
legislature,
and
everything
is
invalid
and
there's
no
way
to
establish
new
legislature."
well,
it
would
depart
from
every
press
of
them
and
yet
if
they
did
that,
we
would
--
we
would
be
in
bad
effects
of
this
as
we
are
with
the
legislature
that
refuses
to
apportionment.
we
might
be
in
bad
effects
without
a
legislature
as
we
are
by
the
ones
we
have.
i
say
that.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes,
to
be
frank,
they
did
as
what
they
(inaudible)
to
say.
they
said,
"chaos
was
dissolved,
it
will
destroy
the
state
government."
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
yes.
mr.
z.
t.
osborn,
jr.
well,
it
might
have
been
quite
possible
and
observant
was
done
in
all
of
the
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
involving
individual
human
rights.
well,
not
those
--
supreme
court
tennessee
is
fiat
justitia
ruat
caelum,
let
justice
be
done
if
the
skies
should
fall.
and
yet
that
same
supreme
court
with
that
same
motto
wrote
the
decision
in
kidd
vs
mccanless.
and
i
am
certain
that
when
the
state
held
that
it
was
alright
to
exclude
negroes
neighborhoods
from
(inaudible)
some
judge
wrote
that
that
was
perfectly
alright
and
could
destroy
the
state
if
it
was
not
to
the
contrary.
and
so
on
those
arguments
would
have
to
be
met
one
at
a
time.
we
cannot
say
--
we
cannot
batch
for
the
--
the
wisdom
nor
for
the
judicial
integrity
or
the
legislative
integrity
of
everyone
but
we
do
say,
the
presumption
is
that
others
will
follow
the
law.
the
presumption
is
that
upon
a
declaration
of
the
invalidity
of
this
unconstitutional
act,
the
legislature
would
follow
the
law.
we
have
no
other
place
to
go.
we
are
at
the
capital
of
the
world.

that's
what
we
should
--
mr.

osborn,
jr.
well,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
--
has
twice
held
that
it
would
not
entertain
such
a
challenge.
every
state
in
the
union
that
has
had
the
question
before
it
is
held
that
they
would
not
entertain
such
a
challenge.
so
i
say
that
we
have
very
strong
precedent,
never
reaching
the
de
facto
doctrine
for
the
refusal
reports.
thank
you
very
much.
