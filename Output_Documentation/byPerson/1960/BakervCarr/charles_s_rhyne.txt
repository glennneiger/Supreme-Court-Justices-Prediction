mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
individual
voting
rights
case
brought
by
11
qualified
voters
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
in
their
complaint,
they
alleged
in
substance
that
by
an
affirmative
purposeful
and
systematic
plan
embodied
in
a
1901
act
of
the
legislature,
their
voting
rights
have
been
diluted
and
the
base
to
the
point
of
nullification.
a
united
states
--
the
district
court,
three-judge
court,
dismissed
their
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
had
no
power
to
protect
their
voting
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
position
is
that
that
decision
was
error,
that
there
exist
no
judicial,
no
man's
land
in
connection
with
constitutional
rights
of
individual
on
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint
were
of
course
admitted
by
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
they
are
in
substance,
this,
tennessee's
constitution
which
was
adopted
in
1870,
provided
that
in
1871
and
in
each
10-year
--
every
10
years
thereafter,
there
should
be
an
enumeration
of
qualified
voters
and
then
the
house
of
representatives
and
senate
should
be
reapportioned
according
to
the
number
of
qualified
voters
in
each
county
or
district.
there
are
--
under
the
constitution,
99
seats
in
the
house
of
representatives.
and
so
--
and
if
you
reapportion
the
house
according
to
the
number
of
enumerated
qualified
voters
under
the
constitutional
formula
in
tennessee,
you
divide
99
into
the
number
of
qualified
voters,
which
in
18
and
--
or
in
1900
was
about
487,000.
there
are
around
two
million
today.
the
house
has
one
peculiar
provision
that
doesn't
apply
to
the
senate
and
that
is
provided
that
in
reapportioning
the
house,
every
county
that
has
the
required
--
two-thirds
of
the
required
ratio
is
entitled
to
a
representative,
they're
95
counties.
and
in
reapportioning
the
senate
in
a
fraction
of
representation
that
is
lost
in
the
house,
shall
be
made
up
as
near
as
maybe
practicable.
so
it's
quite
obvious
that
this
is
a
--
a
mathematical
formula
designed
to
ensure
majority
control
in
--
in
tennessee
and
to
--
right
into
the
fundamental
law,
this
requirement
of
equality
of
representation.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
no,
your
honor.
it
--
it's
not.
it's
--
it's
based
upon
a
discrimination
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it's
--
it's
straight
across
the
boards,
but
even
in
tuskegee,
you
had
the
discrimination
based
on
race,
in
which
we
think
exist
here.
but
this
is
not
a
racial
case,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
we
--
we're
relying
on
that
because
--
mr.
justice
stewart
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
it
involves
a
--
a
slight
amount,
but
then
you
see
the
--
the
very
unusual
provision
of
making
it
up
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
in
the
senate
and
then
this
periodic
reexaminations
every
10
years,
which
rights
into
the
fundamental
law
of
tennessee,
this
requirement
of
equal
representation
in
the
legislature.
but
that
is
not
all
that's
in
the
--
the
tennessee
constitution,
on
this
subject
of
equality,
of
voting
rights,
because
the
constitution
specifically
provides
this
and
i
quote,
“election
shall
be
free
and
equal.”
and
that
the
right
of
suffrage
shall
never
be
denied
to
any
person
entitled
thereto.
and
in
the
constitution
of
tennessee,
it's
provided
that
every
person,
21
years
or
over,
who
resides
in
the
state
of
one
year
or
in
a
county
for
three
months,
is
entitled
to
vote.
now,
as
against
this
mandatory
constitutional
provision,
the
tennessee
legislature
has
not
reapportioned
itself
for
60
years.
its
last
reapportionment
was
in
1901
and
when
in
1901,
they
reapportioned,
they
did
not
do
it
according
to
an
enumeration
of
qualified
voters
so
some
counties
immediately
had
more
representation
they
were
entitled
to
and
11
had
less.
so
we
find
that
even
the
last
time
they
tried
it
in
1901,
they
didn't
do
it
properly
under
the
constitutional
formula.
and
of
course
since
that
time,
they
haven't
done
anything
but
vote
down
every
bill
that
has
proposed
the
reapportionment
of
the
state.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
the
--
the
right
to
vote
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
created
by
the
state
and
this
defines
the
--
the
right
to
vote.
it's
a
vote
given
in
inequality,
insofar
as
representation
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
that
it
--
if
it
was
a
statute
conferring
the
right
to
vote
inequality
and
then
there
were
some
state
action
that
came
along
and
wiped
it
out.
see,
what
we
have
there
is
a
constitutional
provision
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
then
we
have
a
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because
the
legislature
comes
along
by
this
1901
statute
and
takes
away
what
the
constitution
gave
to
the
people
of
tennessee.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
if
your
honor
please,
that
it
does
offend
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i'm
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
i
think
it's
quite
important
that's
in
the
--
the
constitution
of
tennessee
and
that
we
have
a
statute
that
takes
away
what
the
people
gave
to
themselves
in
tennessee.
now,
since
1901
when
this
last
reapportionment
took
place,
the
state
of
tennessee
population
has
grown
tremendously
and
it's
grown
unevenly
and
there
have
been
shifts
of
populations
so
that
the
--
the
city,
so
the
large
cities
have
grown
and
grown
and
grown
and
the
1901
act
which
is
still
the
one
that
reapportioned
the
legislature,
brings
about
these
rather
growth
test
results.
in
the
county
of
--
of
davidson,
of
--
that's
nashville
where
mayor
ben
west,
one
of
the
plaintiff's
lives.
the
--
the
qualified
voting
population
is
grown
from
33,000
to
242,000.
under
the
1901
act,
davidson
county
has
six
representatives
in
the
house
of
representatives,
but
under
the
constitutional
formula
is
entitled
to
10.
they
have
two
senators,
they're
entitled
to
three.
in
shelby
county
where
the
appellant
baker
lives,
the
voting
population
has
grown
from
48,000
to
359,000.
they
have
seven
representatives
under
the
1901
act
and
under
the
constitutional
formula
entitled
to
15.
they
have
three
senators
and
are
entitled
to
five.
and
so
it
goes
in
--
in
knox
county,
the
growth
is
from
19,000
to
151,000
that's
where
knoxville
is
--
is
located.
they
have
three
representatives
and
they're
entitled
to
seven.
now,
i
could
go
on
and
on,
giving
illustrations,
showing
how
this
has
worsened
with
the
increase
in
population
in
cities
and
how
still
the
legislators
have
perpetrated
themselves
in
office
and
maintained
their
control
through
this
1901
act.
just
to
illustrate,
just
how
gross
this
situation
is,
the
complaint
has
attached
to
it
a
number
of
the
charts
and
one
of
them
shows
that
--
it's
on
page
231
of
the
record,
exhibit
4.
that
there
are
23
counties
that
have
25
representatives,
whereas
under
the
constitutional
formula,
they're
entitled
two.
now,
what
does
this
mean
in
--
in
voting
strength?
this
--
and
insofar
as
this
equality
requirement
is
concerned.
in
shelby
county
which
i
referred,
it
takes
20
votes
to
equal
the
weight
of
a
voter
in
moore
county
and
that
comes
about
in
this
way
with
the
--
the
359,000
qualified
voters.
in
--
in
shelby
county,
they
are
entitled
to
elect
15
representatives
and
now,
elect
seven.
moore
county
only
has
200
--
2340
qualified
voters,
but
they
elect
one.
so
it's
about
20
to
1.
the
overall
average
of
the
dilution
of
the
strength
of
--
of
the
vote
of
appellants
is
about
one-tenth.
they
have
about
one-tenth
the
vote
of
the
people
who
live
in
these
favored
counties
in
tennessee.
or
to
put
it
in
another
way,
37%
of
the
people
of
the
state
elect
and
control
20
of
the
33
senators,
40%
of
the
voters
of
tennessee
elect
in
control
63
of
the
99
legislators.
so
you
have
in
effect,
one-third
of
the
people
controlling
two-thirds
of
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
actual
numbers
of
representatives
in
the
last
columns,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
no,
you'll
find
some
charts
mr.
justice
stewart
that
showed
the
--
the
actual
representation
as
exhibits
to
the
--
the
complaint.
each
county
doesn't
have.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
some
of
them
are
put
together
in
--
in
districts
because
you
see,
there
--
there
are
95
counties
and
there
are
99
counties.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
--
and
some
of
the
counties
has
--
have
more
than
one.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
they
are
as
you
--
you're
right.
if
they
are
the
smallest
counties,
but
--
but
of
course
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
put
together
to
--
two
are
put
together
and
they
--
they
make
a
--
a
voting
district.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
because
a
county
only
gets
a
--
a
full
representative,
mr.
justice
stewart
when
they
have
two-thirds
of
the
ratio,
but
dividing
99
into
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
constitution
so
provide
and
that
is
the
--
the
reason,
i
take
it
that
they
provide
for
the
making
up
of
any
representation
that
might
be
lost
in
the
house
and
the
senate.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
oh,
no.
no,
no,
the
constitution
has
said
--
itself
says
as
near
as
maybe
practical.
so
no,
no.
we
don't
content
that
you
have
to
have
the
exact
mathematical
equality
at
all,
but
as
near
as
maybe
practical
and
certainly
the
--
the
picture
that
is
presented
there
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker
isn't
as
near
as
maybe
practical
according
to
enumeration
of
the
qualified
voters.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
--
that
is
true.
that
was
a
decision
of
--
of
the
three-judge
court
that
it
had
no
power
to
enforce
or
protect
the
voting
rights
of
these
individual
plaintiffs
who
are
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
they
do.
they
do
by
the
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
just
to
show
how
it's
practically
impossible
to
expect
the
state
legislator,
after
60
years
of
doing
nothing
to
act,
now,
they
set
forth
in
the
complaint,
these
plaintiffs
do.
many
facts
showing
how
--
that
the
--
the
legislature
controlled
by
the
--
the
rural
areas,
favor
themselves,
they'll
adopt
a
--
a
general
statute
and
then
they
exempt
the
favored
counties
out.
so
that
as
a
result,
you
have
a
situation
where
--
with
respect
to
a
state
allocation
of
school
funds,
on
an
average,
the
--
the
favored
counties
get
$152.
the
unfavored
get
$107.
or
--
and
these
were
all
set
forth
in
rather
voluminous
exhibits
attached
to
--
to
the
complaint
and
you
have
things
like
this,
pickett
county
gets
$226
per
pupil,
shelby
county
gets
$95.
so
we
set
forth
these
facts
showing
how
they
have
used
their
power
to
discriminate
in
their
favor
merely
to
illustrate
the
impossibility
of
expecting
those
who
benefit,
those
who
have
usurped
these
power
to
ever
turn
it
loose.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
--
would
say
that
it
would
come
close
to
be
in
about
in
--
in
ballots.
so
i
think
that
--
that
if
there's
anything
that
this
--
this
formula
would
result
in,
it
would
certainly
result
if
carried
out
in
majority
rule.
and
it's
true,
there's
been
this
great
shift
of
population
to
the
--
to
the
cities,
but
i
haven't
personally
figured
out.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
there
are
some
charges
attached
to
the
compliant
showing
what
would
happen
if
the
state
were
redistrict
according
to
the
constitutional
formula
or
you
look
at
the
--
the
exhibit
f
to
the
complaint,
it
shows
--
it's
on
page
30
of
the
record.
and
it
shows
how
that
the
--
the
senate
would
--
would
look
at
--
we
had
a
--
a
redistribution
according
to
the
constitutional
formula
and
then
in
exhibit
e
on
page
28
of
the
complaint,
we
show
how
the
house
would
look
if
redistributed
according
to
the
constitutional
formula.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'm
told
by
my
distinguished
senior
counsel,
mr.
chandler
here,
that
--
that
knoxville
and
chattanooga
are
included
in
the
eastern
district
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
but
substance
here
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
they
are.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
they
are.
and
--
and
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
would
have
about
40%,
mr.
justice
clark.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
of
the
overall
of
the
representation,
the
urban
area
that
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
it's
two-thirds
to
one-third.
the
representation
not
--
not
population,
the
representation
in
this
legislature
of
course
is
controlled
by
this
1901
act,
which
we
say
was
invalid
when
adopted
in
the
--
and
has
grown
more
invalid
all
the
time
because
they
didn't
--
they
have
never
done
anything
about
it
since
that
time.
now,
in
connection
with
the
facts
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
there
are
other
factors,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
education
law
which
we
have
set
forth
here
in
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
there
are
--
in
it's
--
it's
i
say,
it's
about
100
pages
of
the
record
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but
there
are
the
factors.
but
chiefly,
i
say
they
exempt
themselves
from
the
state
formula
and
by
being
exempt,
they
get
certain
favored
treatment.
that
was
the
--
the
point
i
was
making
and
we're
--
we're
not
asking
for
any
money
back.
we're
just
pointing
that
out
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
to
show
how
it
works
and
how
they
are
favoring
themselves.
now,
all
avenues
of
state
relief
are
absolutely
closed
to
these
appellants.
i
have
referred
to
the
--
the
state
legislature,
we
have
set
forth
here
in
an
exhibit
on
page
126
to
160,
the
record
of
every
proposal
for
reapportionment
in
the
tennessee
legislature
and
that
shows
that
over
and
over
again,
every
bill
for
reapportionment
since
1901
has
voted
down
that
in
the
senate,
no
such
bill
has
ever
received
more
than
13
of
the
33
votes
and
in
the
house,
no
bill
has
ever
received
more
than
36
of
the
99
votes.
so
i
think
that
it's
almost
beyond
question
that
the
legislature
itself
is
not
going
to
change
this
situation.
now,
with
respect
to
the
tennessee
courts,
the
state
courts,
the
supreme
court
has
held
that
it
will
not
grant
any
relief
here
because
to
do
so
according
to
their
view,
would
destroy
the
legislature
and
destroy
the
government
of
tennessee.
and
without
discussing
the
merits
of
that
at
this
point,
i
say
that
--
that
demonstrates
that
relief
through
the
state
courts
is
absolutely
impossible
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
now,
how
about
the
governor?
the
governor
--
the
governors
i
should
say,
have
repeatedly
in
their
messages,
the
legislature
called
attention
to
this
shocking
situation
and
asked
the
legislature
to
reapportion
itself.
and
as
i
pointed
out
just
a
moment
ago,
the
most
they
have
ever
gotten
were
13
votes
in
the
senate
and
36
votes
in
the
house.
so
--
and
the
governor
can
do
nothing
about
it,
but
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
legislature.
and
they
have
--
have
done
that
over
and
over
again
as
this
exhibit
attached
to
the
complaint
shows
without
results.
now,
as
for
the
people
themselves,
there
is
no
initiative
and
referendum
in
tennessee
and
so
the
people
can
do
nothing.
what
about
constitutional
amendment?
the
constitutional
amendment
requires
this.
it
requires
that
a
--
an
amendment
passed,
the
state
legislature
wants
and
then
be
advertised
six
months
before
the
next
meeting
of
the
legislature,
it
passed
the
first
time
by
majority
vote.
but
the
second
time,
it
must
pass
by
two-thirds
vote
and
of
course
these
legislators
obviously,
are
not
going
to
vote
any
constitutional
amendment
that
will
take
care
of
this
situation
because
they
control
the
legislature.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
if
they
did
it,
we
have
--
just
what
we
have
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
wouldn't
help.
i'm
merely
illustrating
it
to
show
that
it's
no
avenue
of
relief
for
us,
that
we
have
no
way
to
turn
under
the
state
government
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
a
constitutional
convention
wouldn't
help
us
because
a
constitutional
convention
is
selected
the
same
way
as
the
legislators.
so
there
is
no
way,
no
action
that
we
can
get
on
the
state
level
that
will
do
anything
about
this
inequity
of
giving
us
on
an
average
of
about
one-tenth
of
a
vote
or
the
people
or
appellants
and
the
favored
few,
a
full
vote.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
in
tennessee?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'll
have
to
ask
mr.
chandler
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but
i'm
not
quite
--
there's
no
controversy
on
--
on
redistricting
insofar
as
a
congressional
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
every
10
years
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
without
any
--
any
difficulty
according
to
mr.
chandler
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
no,
that's
merely
done
when
the
numbers
of
representatives
are
certified
to
the
state.
so
i
--
the
constitution
itself
doesn't
have
any
provision
that
relates
to
congressional
representation.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
ordering
the
three-judge
hearing
in
this
case,
judge
miller
said
after
reviewing
the
facts
that
i
have
reviewed
here,
that
it's
quite
obvious
if
judicial
assistance,
federal
judicial
assistance
is
not
available
to
these
plaintiffs,
no
remedy,
no
practical
remedy
exist
at
all.
and
when
these
facts
were
--
before
the
--
the
three-judge
court,
they
said
this
that,
"this
is
a
clear
violation"
and
i'm
quoting,
“of
the
state
constitution
and
the
rights
of
appellants.”
and
then
they
said
further,
“the
evil
is
a
serious
one
which
should
be
corrected
without
further
delay,”
but
“the
federal
rule
as
enunciated
and
applied
by
the
supreme
court,”
causes
them
to
hope
that
they
have
no
power
to
do
anything
about
protecting
and
enforcing
the
voting
rights
of
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
particular
part
of
the
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
never
been
tried
with
respect
to
the
malapportionment
of
state
legislatures.
it's
true
that,
in
times,
gone
by
and
i
refer
to
that
in
discussing
smiley
versus
holm
and
some
of
the
case
in
a
few
moments.
they
did
require
equality
in
congressional
districts,
but
i
have
some
trouble
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
provision
that
you
refer
to
because
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
only
provides
that
you
can
deny
representation
to
any
state,
a
certain
amount
that
discriminates
against
anyone
on
account
of
a
violation
of
equal
protection
or
anything
else.
so
it's
not
clear
that
--
that
the
congress
itself,
could
adopt
the
law
requiring
state
legislatures
to
reapportion.
i
--
i
think
that
--
that
there
would
be
a
--
a
great
deal
of
doubt
as
to
whether
that
legislation
that
they
referred
to
in
section
5,
was
intended
to
encompass
this
kind
of
thing.
i
think
it
was
more
having
reference
to
the
congressional
rather
than
to
the
state
malapportionment
picture.
i
think
the
--
it's
--
it's
a
fair
summary
of
the
facts
to
--
to
say
as
mr.
chandler
has
said
so
many
times
that
the
real
question
here
is
whether
or
not,
you're
going
to
have
two
classes
of
citizenship
in
tennessee,
half
slave
and
half
free,
or
at
least
one-third
free
and
two-thirds
slave,
because
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
get
out
of
this
illegal
straightjacket
without
some
federal
assistance.
now,
our
first
point
in
support
of
our
complaint
is
this,
that
these
appellants
have
proper
standing
to
maintain
this
suit
for
redress
of
their
--
or
deprivation
of
their
--
their
voting
rights.
that
a
voting
right
is
a
civil
right
and
under
their
ku
klux
act
of
1871,
this
is
one
of
the
civil
rights
that
is
referred
to
there,
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
a
state
may
not
deny
under
color
of
--
of
state
authority.
we
think
that
the
right
to
a
full
vote
rather
than
a
fractional
vote
is
recognized
and
guaranteed
not
only
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
but
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
--
the
right
to
vote
is
certainly
the
most
basic
or
one
of
the
most
basic
rights
that
americans
posses.
it's
a
very
heart
of
our
system
and
this
court
has
time
and
time
again,
upheld
complaints
by
individual
voters
to
either
secure
damages
for
deprivation
of
their
voting
rights
and
it
has
also
ordered
injunctions
to
issue,
to
protect
voting
rights.
now,
the
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
here
by
giving
these
appellants
only
a
fraction
of
a
vote,
is
a
personal
private
wrong
to
them.
this
is
not
a
public
wrong
or
--
or
a
contention
that
you
have
bad
government
in
tennessee
or
that
we
have
an
own
--
own
interest
of
that
kind,
our
complaint
is
based
not
on
any
abstract
right,
but
on
the
right
to
equal
representation,
to
an
equal
vote
given
to
the
state
of
tennessee
and
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
in
smiley
versus
holm,
this
court
allowed
a
citizen,
elector
and
taxpayer
to
attack
malapportionment
of
the
congressional
districting
in
--
in
minnesota.
and
the
same
is
true
in
new
york
in
koenig
versus
flynn
and
in
missouri
in
carroll
versus
becker.
they
--
you
reviewed
such
attacks
on
the
merits
and
we
feel
that
there
can't
be
any
real
question
about
the
standing
of
these
individuals
to
come
into
a
federal
court,
rely
on
the
statute,
42
u.s.c.
1983,
contend
that
they
have
been
deprived
of
one
of
their
civil
rights
and
then
rely
for
jurisdiction
of
the
court
upon
20
or
--
or
28
u.s.c.
1343
which
gives
the
federal
district
courts
original
jurisdiction
to
redress
deprivations
of
civil
rights
and
then
in
1957,
the
congress
made
it
quite
clear
by
an
amendment
that
they
interpret
civil
right
to
include
voting
right
all
this
court
had
time
and
time
again,
prior
to
that
also
included
voting
rights
as
a
--
one
of
the
civil
rights
that
the
--
anyone
was
entitled
to
sue
on
for
deprivation
of,
under
the
so-called
ku
klux
act.
so
when
the
congress
in
--
in
1957
and
again
in
1960
in
the
civil
rights
act,
it
--
it
defined
both
areas
any
action
to
make
a
vote
effective.
this
congress,
we
feel
has
established
a
policy
or
tried
to
establish
a
policy
of
judicial
action
not
in
action
in
this
field.
and
that
the
--
there
can't
be
any
question
about
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
under
the
civil
rights
act.
now,
there
has
been
no
case
that
i
can
find
by
this
court
that
really
flatly
holds
that
federal
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
to
protect
voting
rights
such
as
this.
in
smiley
versus
holm,
carroll
versus
becker,
i've
just
referred
to.
the
court
did
order
this
--
this
protection.
now,
we
recognize
that
in
colegrove
versus
green,
we
have
a
major
problem
of
--
of
distinguishing
what
we
considered
to
be
a
misunderstood
decision.
there,
as
the
court
will
recall,
there
was
a
claim
that
illinois,
if
had
not
reapportioned
its
congressional
districts
since
i
believe
in
1901,
at
that
time,
this
case
is
dated
1946,
was
required
to
--
to
do
so
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
because
in
--
you
had
some
congressional
districts
where
you
had
900,000
people
and
others
with
only
100,000.
and
this
court
voted
one
to
one
to
three.
and
the
--
the
real
decision
was
that
--
that
no
relief
would
--
would
be
granted,
but
on
the
jurisdictional
point,
mr.
justice
rutledge
joined
with
mr.
justice
black,
who
had
written
the
judgment
for
three
who
thought
jurisdiction
exist
and
held
that
the
court
did
have
jurisdiction,
but
he
thought
it
shouldn't
be
exercised
because
of
the
eminence
of
the
election
which
was
in
contest
there.
and
it's
true
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
--
in
his
opinion
after
citing
wood
versus
broom,
which
it
held
that
there
was
no
longer
any
requirement,
any
federal
law
requirement
that
these
congressional
districts
be
substantial
equally
that
had
been
removed
in
1929,
although
it
existed
in
the
1911
act.
so
that
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
there,
“the
legal
merits
of
this
controversy
were
--
were
really
settled
in
that
case."
that's
wood
versus
broom
which
eliminated
the
requirement
of
the
equality
among
congressional
districts.
now,
we
have
a
different
situation
here
because
we
have
a
constitutional
provision
in
tennessee
that
requires
equality
in
this
house
of
representatives'
counties
and
districts
and
in
the
senatorial
districts
in
the
senate.
so
the
fundamental
law
that
applied
--
the
requirement
that
applied
in
the
colegrove
case
was
different.
from
here,
there
was
no
fundamental
law
requiring
equality
of
congressional
districts
there.
the
next
point
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
was
that
congress
had
exclusive
power
to
order
these
congressional
districts
to
be
equal.
now,
we
feel
that
no
such
exclusive
power
exists
in
the
congress
with
respect
to
reapportionment
of
state
legislatives.
so
our
interpretation
of
colegrove
simply
is
that
it
is
not
a
decision
against
this
on
jurisdiction,
but
it's
for
us
on
jurisdiction
that
the
decision
of
this
court
was
not
against
jurisdiction,
but
for
a
jurisdiction.
and
therefore,
we
distinguish
it
and
we
say
that
the
lower
court
here
and
the
other
courts
that
have
cited
it
as
holding
that
no
jurisdiction
exists
are
in
error.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'm
--
i'm
not
trying
to
distinguish
between
a
--
a
federal
law
voting
right
and
a
--
and
a
state
voting
right,
because
we
have
a
state
voting
right
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
i'm
merely
saying
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'm
not
agreeing
with
your
opinion.
i'm
merely
distinguishing
it
from
this
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
would
say
that
--
that
i
--
i
don't
intend
to
--
to
distinguish
it
on
that
basis.
i
think
that
all
voters
should
be
equal
in
federal
elections
and
in
state
elections.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
--
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
don't
come
to
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
true.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
--
and
it
did.
it
referred
to
this
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'm
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
to
say
all
have
been
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
would
say
that
insofar
as
--
as
colegrove
is
concerned
then
i
will
just
make
the
--
the
one
distinction
that
it
did
vote
4
to
3
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
a
far
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
in
the
gomillion
case,
it's
true
that
--
that
colegrove
was
distinguished
on
the
basis
that
you
had
affirmative
action
in
gomillion.
now,
we
have
affirmative
action
here.
this
1901
act
was
invalid,
when
it
was
adopted
and
over
and
over
again,
since
1901,
the
tennessee
legislature
has
rejected
any
reapportionment
time
and
time
again.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
as
to
jurisdiction
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
--
i
would
agree
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
i
think
that
non-action
can
be
just
as
bad
as
affirmative
action,
but
that
distinction
was
made
in
--
in
gomillion
and
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
that
we
do
have
the
affirmative
action
here
in
--
in
this
case.
now,
we
--
we
feel
that
--
that
jurisdiction
exists
and
that
it
should
be
exercised,
because
this
record
presents
one
of
the
--
the
clearest
denials
of
constitutional
rights.
we
feel
that's
ever
been
brought
before
this
court,
we
have
this
mathematical
standard
that
guarantees
equality.
we
have
the
periodic
reexamination
to
be
sure
that
the
--
the
equality
is
maintained.
we
have
the
qualifications
for
voters
established
by
tennessee
and
they
must
treat
everyone
who'd
come
within
those
qualifications
equally,
and
they're
not
doing
it
by
willful,
purposeful
discrimination.
they
are
not
giving
to
the
appellants
here
and
those
similar
situated
a
full
vote.
there
is
no
rationale
basis
for
this
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
residents
or
geography,
anymore
than
there's
any
rational
basis
for
discrimination
on
the
base
of
race,
color,
creed
and
certainly
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
exhausted
in
the
race
area.
it
reaches
other
forms
of
discrimination
and
we
think
that
it
certainly
reaches
this
discrimination
which
is
presented
in
this
case.
because
as
mr.
justice
holm
said
in
nixon
versus
herndon,
“all
persons
whether
colored
or
white
shall
stand
equal
before
the
laws
of
the
state.”
so
without
further
discussion
of
the
--
of
the
merits
because
i've
read
the
statement
by
the
three-judge
court
which
said
that,
“we
were
right
on
the
merits
that
our
rights
were
denied
and
had
been
denied
and
that
something
should
be
done
about
this.”
i
move
along
to
an
area
where
there
is
some
dispute
at
least
between
us
and
our
distinguished
adversary,
the
attorney
general
of
--
of
tennessee
and
--
and
his
associates
on
the
nature
of
the
remedy.
now,
we
feel
that
we
brought
here
a
--
a
case
or
controversy
that
is
right
for
judicial
determination
and
which
calls
for
a
judicial
remedy.
and
we
want
to
demonstrate
that
the
relief
that
we
seek
is
within
the
historical
remedies
of
a
court
of
equity.
the
state
courts
have
given
it
in
the
past
and
it's
not
beyond
the
reach
of
a
court,
a
federal
court
of
equity.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
--
to
reverse
and
remand
to
the
district
court,
so
it
can
perform
its
equity
judicial
duty.
now,
what
do
we
suggest
as
--
as
a
first
step?
we
say
that
if
this
court
finds
that
jurisdiction
exists,
it
should
reverse
and
remand
to
the
district
court.
and
that
on
that
point
alone
--
on
that
action
alone,
we
feel
that
the
legislature
of
--
of
tennessee
must
be
presumed
once
this
court
has
declared
the
law
to
--
to
follow
that
law
and
it
--
then
it
will
go
ahead
and
perform
its
legislative
function.
now,
we
have
some
history
to
back
us
up
recently
in
--
in
new
jersey,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
and
it
waited
to
enter
its
order
until
the
legislature
could
act
and
the
legislature
did
act.
in
minnesota,
federal
district
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
and
that
wait
for
the
legislature
to
act
and
the
legislature
did
act.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
in
magraw
versus
donovan,
it's
cited
in
our
--
our
brief,
mr.
justice
black.
now,
we
feel
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
they
haven't
done
so
well
in
illinois,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
could
cite
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
some
others
like
wisconsin,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
well,
in
wisconsin
and
--
and
in
the
other
states,
it's
true.
that
--
that
some
of
them
have,
but
if
on
finding
that
jurisdiction
exists
and
reversing
the
district
court,
there's
any
further
relief
that
is
--
is
required.
we
feel
that
there
are
several
other
alternative
steps
that
we
merely
want
to
mention
because
to
demonstrate
to
this
court
that
they
are
judicial
things
that
can
be
done
to
hear
this
malignant
cancer
that
exists
in
this
field.
and
the
first
thing
that
we
would
---
would
suggest
is
that
all
of
the
state
officials
who
have
anything
to
do
with
elections,
be
enjoined
from
conducting
any
further
elections
on
the
1901
act.
we're
not
asking
for
ouster
of
the
current
legislature
or
anything
like
that.
we
just
prevent
him
from
continued
use
of
the
1901
act
and
then
we
think
that
the
governor
would
call
him
in
the
special
session
and
they
would
go
ahead
and
perform
there
legislative
function.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
in
tandem
with
that
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
would
suggest
the
possibility
of
a
declaratory
judgment
that
1901
act
is
invalid.
then
if
you
coupled
the
two
together,
we
certainly
think
that
the
legislature
would
act.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
like
that
suggestion,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
i'm
merely
mentioning
now
some
of
the
things
that
would
be
considered
not
but
you,
but
by
the
district
court
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
reasonable
way
that
this
can
be
worked
out
on
the
remedy
field
and
that
there
is
no
uncertainty
about
a
court
of
equity
fashioning
a
remedy
that
would
meet
the
--
the
facts
of
this
situation.
and
they
could
take
this
step-by-step.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
don't
think
you
do,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
that
all
you
need
to
do
is
--
is
reverse
and
remand.
i
say
i'm
merely
mentioning
these
to
demonstrate
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
a
court
of
equity
can
do
to
cure
this
situation
or
to
assist
the
legislature
in
moving
to
do
its
duty.
another
thing
that
--
that
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
that
could
be
done
is
the
court
could
appoint
a
master
to
conduct
an
election
under
the
constitutional
formula,
or
order
the
state
officials
to
come
up
with
the
plan
which
under
the
constitutional
formula,
which
it
could
approve
or
disapprove.
we
also
mentioned
the
possibility
of
an
election
at
large.
this
court
in
smiley
versus
holm
and
other
cases
that
order
elections
at
large
for
congressional
representatives
and
we
think
that
you
could
do
the
same
thing
here,
because
in
kidd
versus
mccanless,
they
said
you
couldn't
have
an
election
at
large,
but
when
it
comes
down
to
whether
or
not,
a
federally
protected
right
is
to
be
enforced
or
destroyed.
this
court
can
take
its
own
view
of
the
remedy
and
it
need
not
follow
the
view
of
the
--
of
tennessee
court.
and
we
also
have
the
fact
that
the
tennessee
constitution
has
almost
identical
provision
with
those
relied
upon
by
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
in
smiley
versus
holm,
when
he
ordered
this
election
at
large
out
in
--
in
minnesota.
now,
i
mentioned
these
remedies
and
the
distinguished
solicitor
general
will
probably
mention
these
and
others,
but
i
merely
wanted
to
demonstrate
that
these
things
would
be
temporary
that
these
are
--
are
judicial
things
--
these
are
things
that
courts
can
do,
and
that
the
courts
are
not
helpless.
that
this,
we
just
cannot
accept
the
view
that
the
federal
courts
are
--
are
helpless
to
prevent
the
very
flagrant
and
gross
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
which
we
have
demonstrated
here
in
--
in
this
case.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
response.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
on
behalf
of
the
solicitor
general
that
he
wanted
to
lodge
with
the
clerk
the
maps
to
which
he
referred
yesterday
and
if
that
maybe
done,
he
would
appreciate
it
very
much,
and
we
would
too.
mr.
chief
justice
and
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
listened
very
careful
to
my
distinguished
adversaries
here
to
see
if
they
could
utter
one
word
in
defense
of
the
factual
discrimination
which
exists
in
this
case
and
i
failed
to
hear
it.
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
but
what's
the
right
to
vote
is
created
by
the
state
of
tennessee
and
we
don't
challenge
that
at
all.
we
say
that
when
that
right
is
created,
it
must
be
given
to
everyone
in
equality
under
the
measurable
equality
set
forth
in
the
constitution
of
tennessee.
and
that
if
anyone
is
discriminated
against,
by
then,
that
the
right
to
vote
is
a
part
of
their
civil
rights
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
comes
into
play
and
we
have
that
protection.
we
do
not
believe
that
--
that
any
state
can
invade
a
federally
protected
right
and
so
keep
it
completely
destroyed
or
nullified
or
--
or
eliminated
or
that
all
relief
is
blocked
forever
such
as
the
situation
here.
and
i
also
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
--
the
saylor
case
which
was
referred
to
here
in
five
ballot
box
stuffing,
not
just
counting
ballots
but
stuffing
ballot
boxes
so
that
--
that
votes
were
deluded
so
it's
--
it's
right
in
point
with
this,
what
i
would
call
ballot-box
rigging
here
so
that
one
man's
vote
is
worth
only
a
tenth
or
a
twentieth
of
another
man's
vote
and
i
say
that
there
can
be
no
question
but
what
that
is
discrimination.
i
say
there
can
be
no
question
but
what
under
the
civil
rights
act,
the
right
to
vote
is
protected,
that
it
is
a
civil
right
and
that
it
is
a
personal
right.
i
was
quite
surprised
to
--
to
hear
it
argued
that
the
--
that
the
right
to
vote
is
--
is
not
a
personal
right,
why,
certainly
it's
a
personal
right.
and
it's
been
held
so
in
herndon
versus
nixon
and
all
other
cases
that
i've
ever
read
involving
the
right
to
vote
in
this
court.
so,
we
say
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
no
power
in
this
1901
act
or
in
any
other
to
--
to
nullify
a
federally
protected
right.
we
say
that
here
we're
asking
this
court
which
is
under
our
system
of
checks
and
balances,
the
ultimate
safeguard
of
individual
rights
of
civil
liberties
in
this
country
to
carry
out
its
duty.
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
tennessee
is
not
the
ultimate
safeguard
of
individual
civil
rights
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america,
this
court
and
the
federal
courts
and
all
courts
are.
and
so,
we
say
that
the
right
to
vote
is
such
a
civil
right
and
that
it
is
protected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
we
would
sum
up
our
case
in
this
way.
we
have
here
11
voters
who
have
been
given
a
right
in
tennessee
to
vote
in
equality
with
all
other
voters
similarly
situated.
and
the
state
of
tennessee
has,
through
this
act
of
--
of
1901,
taken
away
their
right
of
equality
and
given
them
a
one-twentieth
or
one-tenth
of
the
right
to
vote.
and
so,
when
all
other
avenues
of
relief
are
blocked,
we
ultimately
must
come
here,
we're
at
the
end
of
the
line.
there
cannot
be
a
judicial
no
man's
land
where
civil
rights
are
involved
in
the
united
states
of
america
and
that
is
what
is
involved
here.
and
this
court
in
smiley
versus
holm
and
in
case
after
case
has
always
held
that
the
right
to
vote
of
an
american
is
important,
that
it
is
a
personal
right
and
then
it
cannot
be
taken
away
by
any
action
of
any
state
government.
so
therefore,
we
believe
that
these
individual
voters
have
a
--
a
right
which
under
these
facts
have
been
taken
away
and
we
ask
this
court
to
do
as
courts
have
from
time
immemorial,
reverse
and
remand
this
case
to
the
district
court
with
the
instructions
to
provide
a
remedy
that
is
adequate
to
the
protection
of
the
right
that
is
here
before
the
court
and
which
tennessee
has
deluded
and
destroyed.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
we
start
to
do
it
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it's
unreasonable
--
if
it's
unreasonable
classification
but
there's
no
defense
here
that
this
classification
that's
involved
here,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
reasonable.
we
would
recognize
any
reasonable
classification.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
an
absolute
--
not
an
absolute
slab
rule
numerical
provision.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
only
other
one
i
know
of,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
is
in
oklahoma.
now,
i
--
i
have
not
--
i
have
not
researched
out
that
point
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
pardon?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it
is
and
i
do
know
that
once
the
--
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
did
reapportion
the
state
of
arkansas,
but
it
seemed
to
have
done
that
just
under
--
or
without
any
specific
constitutional
provision.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
voting
rights
case.
it's
brought
here
on
appeal
by
11
tennessee
voters
who
seek
federal
court
protection
to
end
flagrant
discrimination
against
their
right
to
vote.
these
11
tennessee
voters
lived
in
five
of
the
largest
cities
of
tennessee.
they
are
the
intended
and
actual
victims
of
a
statutory
scheme
which
devalues
reduces
their
right
to
vote
to
about
120th
of
the
value
of
the
vote
given
to
certain
rural
residents.
since
the
right
to
vote
is
the
greatest
civil
right,
the
most
fundamental
civil
right
under
our
system
of
government,
this
system
under
the
statute
of
tennessee
is
as
shocking
as
it
is
purposeful
and
successful.
these
appellants
bring
their
case
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
civil
rights
act.
now
the
district
court
in
passing
on
their
complaint
said
that
it
entirely
agreed
that
their
rights
were
violated
and
that
the
evil
was
a
serious
one
which
should
be
corrected
without
delay
but
that
court
found
that
it
either
did
not
have
the
power
or
should
not
exercise
it
under
the
precedents
to
which
it
refer.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
did
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
did
mr.
justice
stewart.
if
you
will
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
court,
you
will
find
that
it
indicated
both.
i
realized
that
our
adversaries
have
said
that
the
court
only
had
reference
to
the
violation
of
the
state
constitution
but
if
you
will
look
at
page
219,
the
court
says
it
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
page
219
of
the
record,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
third
line.
the
court
said
it
is
strenuously
argued
by
the
plaintiff
that
the
case
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
one
involving
a
clear
violation
of
their
individual
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
then
when
the
court
later
on
refers
to
both
the
state
constitution
and
rights,
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
that
it's
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
it
had
reference
to
both
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
rights
under
the
constitution
of
tennessee.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
on
page
219.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
i
can
--
i'll
read
it
all
in
order
that
there'll
be
no
mistake
about
it.
the
part
that
i
read
which
referred
to
violation
of
their
individual
rights
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
about
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
lines
there
at
the
top.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
it
said
--
and
for
this
reason
that
the
court
should
in
some
way
overcome
its
reluctance
to
intervene
in
matters
of
a
local
political
nature
and
formulate
a
remedy
which
would
adequately
protect
their
rights.
they
refer
to
their
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
is
insisted
that
the
wrong
committed
against
them
by
the
failure
and
refusal
of
the
state
legislature
to
abide
by
the
state
constitution
is
clear
and
unmistakable
and
that
the
court
should
not
leave
such
wrong
without
a
remedy.
with
the
plaintiffs'
argument
that
the
legislature
of
tennessee
is
guilty
of
a
clear
violation
of
the
state
constitution
and
of
the
rights
of
the
plaintiff,
the
court
entirely
agrees
and
i
submit
your
honors
that
a
fair
reading
indicates
that
the
court
had
reference
to
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it
referred
to
a
wrong
under
the
state
constitution
and
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
of
course,
the
next
sentence
refers
to
the
--
to
the
evil
and
their
statement
that
they
entirely
agreed
that
a
serious
one
that
should
be
corrected
without
delay.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
certainly
did
not
mr.
justice
frankfurter
because
we
contend
that
our
right
to
vote
that
these
voters
are
speaking
of
stems
from
the
state
constitution.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
did
not
intend
to,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
meant
to
--
to
say
that
we
claim
both
rights
under
the
state
constitution
and
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
it's
our
--
to
say
a
little
plain,
i
think
they're
both
--
say
the
same
thing.
now,
the
right
to
vote
in
tennessee
is
created
by
the
constitution
for
all
over
21
years
of
age
who
have
resided
in
the
state
for
one
year
or
in
the
county
where
they
want
to
vote
for
three
months.
and
the
constitution
also
provides
that
voting
shall
be
free
and
equal.
now,
true
it
is
that
this
appeal
is
based
on
still
higher
authority,
the
great
principle
of
equality
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
principle
of
equality
of
man
which
was
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence
in
which
is
so
deeply
embedded
in
the
--
in
the
conscience
and
morals
of
our
people.
the
way
in
which
these
voting
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
have
been
effectively
denied,
so
effectively
we
say
as
to
be
effectively
destroyed
is
by
a
so-called
reapportionment
statute
adopted
in
1901.
now,
the
ultimate
thrust
of
that
statute
today
is
that
one-third
of
the
qualified
voters
living
in
the
rural
areas
of
the
state
of
tennessee
elect
two
thirds
of
the
state
legislature.
now,
that
1901
statute
not
only
violates
this
requirement
of
equality
in
voting,
which
i
had
just
referred
to
the
tennessee
constitution,
not
only
violates
the
requirement
of
equality
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
but
it
plies
directly
in
the
teeth
of
and
openly
and
flagrantly
violates
another
provision
of
the
tennessee
constitution
which
is
designed
to
by
periodic
10-year
reapportionment
of
the
state
legislature
to
guarantee
this
equality
of
which
the
tennessee
constitution
speaks.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it's
as
of
today,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
19
and
--
in
1901,
there
were
11
representatives
under
this
1901
act
assigned
to
counties
and
districts
who
were
not
entitled
to
them.
that
is
11
out
of
99.
i'm
not
a
good
enough
mathematician
to
give
you
the
exact
ratio.
but
when
this
1901
act
was
adapted,
the
legislature
failed
two
things.
it
failed
to
enumerate
the
qualified
voters
as
required
by
the
constitution.
and
it
failed
to
follow
the
constitution
or
provision
which
i
was
just
going
to
refer
to
that
requires
this
enumeration
and
then
apportionment
of
representation
the
99
members
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
33
members
of
the
senate
according
to
the
voting
population
among
the
counties
and
districts
of
tennessee.
now,
that
is
a
mathematical
formulary.
there's
no
question
but
what
it
was
violated
by
the
1901
act.
and
since
1901,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
situation
has
grown
steadily
worse.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
very
true.
and
we
have
filed
with
the
marshal
some
figures
bringing
up-to-date
the
exhibits
to
the
complaint
because
we
did
not
have
when
we
argued
this
case
before,
the
voting
population
figures
from
the
census.
under
those
voting
population
figures,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
there
are
now
29
representatives
assigned
to
counties
and
districts
who
are
not
entitled
to
them
under
this
constitutional
formulary
because
of
what
you
referred
to,
the
growth
in
population
and
the
shifts
in
population.
and
they
also
reveal
the
fact
that
in
some
of
these
rural
counties
in
the
last
10
years,
they
lost
as
much
as
21%
of
their
qualified
voters
so
there's
a
tremendous
shift
going
on
from
the
rural
areas
to
the
city
urban
areas
in
--
in
tennessee.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
on
232,
exhibit
5,
it
shows
there
the
counties
who
were
given
11
more
if
you'll
subtract
the
7
of
the
--
from
the
18,
the
number
they
were
entitled
to
by
the
formulary
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
in
1900,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
ratio
today
is
given
in
these
latest
figures
that
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
these
revised
figures
which
we
have
given
you.
and
it's
entitled
to
--
its
exhibit
number
5,
the
second
page,
mr.
justice
brennan,
addendum
to
exhibit
5.
and
it
shows
that
the
number
of
direct
representatives
that
shall
be
--
is
entitled
to
under
the
formula
is
15.
the
actual
number
they
have
is
seven.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
explain
that
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
taking
more
county
where
the
--
moore
county
has
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
one
county.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'm
using
it
as
illustration.
that
is
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
the
extreme.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
the
extreme.
moore
--
well,
i
--
if
moore
county
has,
for
example
2300
and
shelby
county
312,000,
they
have
seven,
moore
county
has
one
and
that's
comes
out
to
a
mathematical
20
to
1.
it's
true
that
in
the
exhibits
which
you
have
before
you
which
were
just
completed,
that
i
think
the
situation
around
creates
oak
ridge
is
even
worst
now
because
of
the
influx
there
in
anderson
county.
but
the
20
to
1
exist
with
respect
to
--
to
shelby
and
moore
county.
its
not
--
that's
throughout
in
the
state.
it's
an
average
about
one-tenth.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
--
it's
not
one
of
the
five.
it
has
a
voter
representative
before
the
court
now.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
knoxville,
nashville,
chattanooga
and
memphis.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
fifth
one
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
is
east
tennessee
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
area.
no
it
does
not
include
--
its
montgomery
county,
tennessee.
our
voter
is
a
--
is
a
judge
of
the
county
court
of
montgomery
county.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
it's
an
urban
area
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
counted
montgomery
county
as
a
--
as
a
city
or
an
urban
area.
i
should've
said
five
of
the
largest
urban
areas.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it
was
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
they
did
violate
it
in
this
1901
act
because
they
assigned
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
up
until
that
time,
they
have
complied
with
the
constitutional
formula.
there
were
3
--
well
9
in
19
and
--
or
1880,
1890
reapportionment,
we
have
no
--
no
quarrel
with
it,
evidently
it
were
--
it
carried
out
mathematical
formula.
now,
this
mathematical
formulary
was
contained
in
the
constitution
of
tennessee
way
back
in
1835
and
reembodied
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
in
--
in
the
new
constitution.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
would
imagine
that
at
that
time,
tennessee
was
largely
a
rural
state.
this
urban
growth
has
come
greatly
since
that
time.
now,
i
would
say
simply
on
the
--
the
factual
situation
that
we
have
tried
to
--
to
update
that
with
the
figures
that
we
have
given
the
court
to
show
of
what
we
said
the
last
time
was
that
this
situation
is
growing
worse
instead
of
better
all
the
time.
and
our
position
is
that
when
tennessee
creates
this
right
to
vote,
it
must
give
it
inequality
to
all
who
qualify.
and
no
one
can
say
that
under
this
reapportionment
statute
of
1901,
all
the
voters
are
treated
equally
and
partially
and
uniformly
and
this
court
has
said
a
good
many
times
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
strikes
down
discriminations
whether
they
are
sophisticated
or
simpleminded.
and
we
think
that
whether
you
cloak
it
under
the
terms
of
reapportionment
or
any
other
cloaks,
no
matter
how
ingeniously
or
geniously
contrived
that
this
is
a
discrimination
which
is
clear
from
the
facts
on
--
in
the
complaint.
and
under
those
facts,
these
voters
have
a
constitutional
right
that
is
invaded
and
have
standing
to
maintain
this
suit
because
a
man's
right
to
vote
is
personal
to
him.
it's
not
shared
with
anyone.
and
when
these
people
have
their
right
to
vote
invaded,
deluded,
rendered
worthless
or
practically
so
by
this
1901
act,
it's
a
personal
wrong
to
them
to
have
their
vote
so
affected.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
you
mean
expressly
saying
that?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
there
are,
as
you
well
know
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
many
states
where
there
is
not
equality.
i
know
no
state
that
actually
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
spells
it
out.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
you
mean
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
don't
believe
not
in
those
--
those
terms.
i
say
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
inequality
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
the
inequality
exists
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
of
course,
some
of
the
state
legislatures
are
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
are
set
up.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
not.
i
have
not
read
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
that
--
as
i
--
i
didn't
understand
his
question
to
reach
that
kind
of
a
situation
where
the
constitution
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
doesn't
say
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
any
expressed
words,
the
county
union
--
unit
system,
the
town
system
in
--
in
new
england
and
all
the
things
that
the
solicitor
general
has
reviewed
in
his
brief.
i
do,
of
course,
provide
for
inequality.
but
i
understood
mr.
justice
frankfurter
to
say
is
there
any
state
that
--
that
in
express
language,
violates
the
great
principle
of
equality.
and
i
say
there
is
no
state
constitution
adopted
--
the
people
would've
adopted
if
that
spells
out
--
the
people
over
here
are
not
going
to
have
an
equal
vote
with
the
other
people.
i
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
just
can
imagine
such
a
discriminatory
provision
being
put
in
any
--
the
basic
fundamental
law
of
any
state.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
oh,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
again,
i
had
understood
mr.
chief
--
justice
frankfurter's
question
to
exclude
that
situation
and
to
ask
me
whether
or
not
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
it
was
written
as
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
oh
well
now,
if
you
--
if
you
bring
all
of
this
geographic
div
--
division
of
state
ledgers
by
--
legislatures
by
the
county
unit
system
in
--
in
georgia
or
the
town
system
up
in
new
england,
why
of
course
they
are
inequalities.
but
i
thought
you
wanted
to
know
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
if
it
was
written
out.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
that's
what
i
thought.
there
is
no
provision
in
any
state
constitution
that
makes
--
doesn't
say
one
man,
one
vote.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
what
i'm
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
that
is
a
rather
common
provision
throughout
the
country.
some
say
its
in
kansas.
you
may
have
noticed
in
the
brief
amicus
curiae
i
filed
here,
any
county
that
has
over
250
people
is
entitled
to
one
representative.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
now
i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
they're
almost
as
many
different
provisions
with
respect
to
this
as
there
are
states.
there
is
no
great
uniformity
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
alright.
now,
proceeding
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
texas
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
now,
that
--
i
think
that
--
that
texas
certainly
takes
into
consideration
changes
in
population
and
--
and
is
in
many
respects
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
no
and
--
and
we're
not
arguing
for
absolute
mathematical
equality
here.
we're
saying
we
have
a
--
a
mathematical
formula
in
the
tennessee
constitution.
but
we
are
asking
for
the
reasonable
equality
required
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
yes
because
the
tennessee
constitution
is
one
of
the
important,
the
very
important
legal
facts
that
this
court
must
consider
in
relating
this
up
to
the
--
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
shows
what
tennessee
intended
with
respect
to
--
to
voting
rights
and
the
extent
of
the
violation
of
that
intention
and
then
also
indicates
a
measurable
remedy.
i
think
the
tennessee
constitution
has
tremendous
significance
in
this
case
because
in
each
state
i
think
that
in
considering
the
fourteenth
amendment,
you
have
to
consider
the
totality
of
the
facts
and
the
legal
provisions
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
when
you
do
that.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
wouldn't
say
to
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
that
the
tennessee
supreme
court
has
never
really
construed
this
reapportionment
provision.
all
it
did
was
say
that
it'd
be
chaos
if
we
enforced
it
they
did
not
say
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
that
the
1901
act
was
constitutional.
they
didn't
pass
on
that
question.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
was
going
to
say
that
one
of
the
big
factors
in
this
case
is
that
we
are
at
the
end
of
road.
obviously,
we
can
get
no
relief.
we've
exhausted
all
of
our
remedies
in
tennessee.
the
tennessee
state
court
will
give
us
no
relief.
its
obvious
that
this
state
legislature
in
the
last
60
years
which
hasn't
reapportioned
itself
in
which
never
once
has
the
senate
given
more
than
13
votes
in
favor
of
reapportionment,
never
once
has
the
house
given
more
than
36
votes
in
favor
of
reapportionment.
there
is
no
remedy
there.
the
governor
can
do
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it's
--
it
--
it
passed
a
resolution
at
the
last
session
to
provide
for
a
steady
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
in
1959
it
turned
it
down.
there
is
an
exhibit,
exhibit
2
attached
to
the
complaint
of
mayor
west
which
sets
forth
every
time
that
the
legislature
has
considered
it
for
the
last
60
years
even
though
about
--
which
has
turned
it
down.
and
i
say,
never
more
than
13
in
the
senate,
never
more
than
36
in
the
house.
and
of
course,
you'll
remember
there
--
there
are
33
votes
in
the
senate
and
there
are
36
votes,
i
mean
99
votes
in
the
house.
now,
with
respect
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
they
appointed
a
committee
to
--
to
study
last
year.
but
so
far
as
i
know,
it
hasn't
done
anything
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
you
remember
the
--
the
assistant
attorney
general
advised
this
court
of
that
study
group
last
argument.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
they
made
no
report
at
all,
so
far
as
i
know.
i
think
they've
had
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
true.
and
two
legislatures
have
to
vote
on
it
so
that
(inaudible)
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
true.
there's
no
initiative
and
--
and
referendum
in
--
in
tennessee.
and
the
governor
can
do
nothing.
if
you'll
look
at
this
exhibit
2,
the
governors
have
repeatedly
asked
the
legislature
to
reapportion
itself
and
this
fallen
off
on
deaf
ears.
so
i
think
we're
at
the
end
of
the
road.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
of
course
not,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
now,
the
right
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
this
that
we
would
probably
still
be
here.
but
i
do
--
do
not
want
to
--
to
say
for
one
second
that
we
don't
rely
on
the
state
constitution
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
to
show
the
kind
of
vote
that
has
been
created
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
in
tennessee
and
to
show
the
--
the
facts
that
relate
up
this
fourteenth
amendment
question
which
we
bring
here
to
the
court.
we're
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
because
of
discrimination
against
the
votes
of
--
of
these
voters.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
assuming
the
--
the
same
kind
of
--
of
discrimination
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
assuming
a
lot
of
conjectural
things,
of
course
you'd
--
you'd
bring
in
the
fact
of
whether
you'd
have
conflicting
statutes
and
all
of
that
so
i
think
that
merely
points
out
the
importance
of
the
tennessee
constitutional
provision,
the
fact
that
it
is
in
the
basic
law
there.
the
fact
it
is
tremendously
important
in
this
case.
and
it's
certainly
much
more
important
than
if
it
were
just
a
statute
of
the
--
of
the
state
of
tennessee
that
would
bring
on
all
these
other
things.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
in
connection
with
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
if
it
were
not
carried
out.
if
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
we
would
not
be
here
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
we
would
not
be
here
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
if
--
if
it
were
done
by
the
constitution,
i
don't
know
--
we
would
be
here.
yes,
because
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
think
it's
tremendously
important
because
i
say
it
shows
what
a
vote
means
in
tennessee.
it
shows
how
much
discretionary
area
there
is
in
dealing
with
the
--
the
--
a
right
to
vote
in
tennessee
according
to
the
fundamental
law
of
tennessee.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
we're
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
civil
rights
act.
but
we
are
saying
that
this
tennessee
constitutional
provision
had
tremendous
significance
because
it
shows
the
fundamental
law
of
tennessee
what
the
people
of
tennessee
think
about
this
and
we're
not
saying
that
this
court
has
to
--
to
carry
out
that
formula
but
we're
saying
that
it's
one
of
the
things
that
the
court
should
consider
in
deciding
whether
or
not
there's
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
because
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
think
when
analyze
it,
you'll
see
that
the
tennessee
requirement
of
equality,
the
fourteenth
amendment
requirement
of
equality
are
one
and
the
same
thing.
they're
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
they're
not
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it
is.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
i
say
we
are
here
insisting
that
the
formulary
in
tennessee
should
be
carried
out.
we
think
that
that
measures
the
right.
it's
a
measurable
right.
now,
it's
true
that
this
court
can
either,
having
jurisdiction
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
can
use
any
of
the
things
that
are
available
to
it
to
--
to
ensure
that
the
voting
rights
of
these
people
are
carried
out.
this
court
could
if
it
shows
--
interpret
the
tennessee
--
having
jurisdiction
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
interpret
the
tennessee
constitution
and
not
even
have
to
reach
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
done
that
in
--
in
cases.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it's
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it's
done
it
in
the
case,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
frankfurter,
the
greene
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
this
is
greene
versus
nashville
--
louisville
railroad,
244
u.s.
499
in
which
the
--
the
question
there
was
discriminatory
taxation.
the
court
explicitly
took
jurisdiction
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
decided
the
case
under
the
kentucky
constitution
and
said,
"we
don't
have
to
reach
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
amendment
question.”
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
you
enforce
the
--
the
state
constitution
of
kentucky
in
that
case
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
answer
your
question
in
this
way.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
did
not
decide
in
the
mccanless
case
that
the
constitution
of
tennessee
creates
no
rights.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
said
it
would
not
enforce
those
rights,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
that
is
the
way
i
read
that
decision.
and
i
think
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
it
because
all
it
said
is,
if
we
enforce
these
rights,
we'll
have
chaos
in
tennessee.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
--
i
can
see
that
we
read
it
differently,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
did.
and
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
the
chancellor
of
the
lower
court
there
upheld
the
rights.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
can
see
that
the
--
i
say
we
disagree
on
interpretation
of
the
--
of
what
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
the
tennessee
supreme
court
did.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
we
cannot
mr.
--
but
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
how
would
they
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
how
would
the
voters
be
affected
by
inequality?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
frankly
don't
know
because
--
to
the
fact
that
the
constitution
provides
for
99
and
33
is
one
of
the
important
facts
in
this
case
which
proves
the
importance
of
the
tennessee
constitution,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
since
they
held
a
system,
i
would
rest
on
that.
i
would
say
that
--
that
--
certainly
in
treating
the
right
to
vote
for
members
of
the
legislature,
all
the
states
have
some
system
and
i
can't
imagine
them
not
having
one.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
what
they
have
now,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
but
i
--
i
say
i
--
i'm
a
little
hesitant
to
speculate
about
if
this
and
if
that
because
i
think
we
have
to
take
the
facts
and
the
law
in
--
that
we
have
here
in
this
case
because
in
this
case,
we
have
a
--
a
delusion
of
a
--
a
voter
right,
a
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
has
in
good
many
cases
held
will
not
stand
up
against
the
ban
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
--
the
texas
jaybird
case
for
example
where
--
that
you
held
that
negroes
must
be
allowed
to
vote
in
the
jaybird
primary
as
well
as
the
democratic
primary
in
the
general
election
because
that's
the
only
place
that
their
vote
could
be
affected.
and
i
think
that
in
--
in
this
case
as
in
classic
that
--
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
and
in
saylor
that
the
delusion
of
a
vote
is
a
denial
of
the
vote.
and
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
fundamental
rights
can
be
lost
by
indirection
as
--
as
well
as
direction
and
that
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
will
give
relief
because
voters
have
standing
to
complain
and
come
here
to
get
this
court
to
protect
their
rights.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
reasonable
equality.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
reasonable
equality.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
mathematical
equality
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
but
reasonable
equality.
i
think
that
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
law's
requirement
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
reasonable
equality.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
15.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
because
of
the
grossness.
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
i
would
agree.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
think
this
court
has
from
time
immemorial
taken
the
facts
in
each
case
and
passed
on
them.
and
you
yourself
in
this
--
i
think
it's
this
d'amico
case
versus
maryland
said
that
you
didn't
have
to
draw
a
line
for
all
time.
you
draw
it
case
by
case.
and
so
i
think
that
we
do
have
the
required
--
15
here
in
--
in
dealing
with
the
actual
facts
rather
than
speculative
facts
that
that
is
a
violation
of
--
of
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
main
thing
we
have
to
think
about
here
is
--
is
voting
rights
in
disparagement,
in
degrading,
in
delusion
of
those
rights
all
over
the
united
states
of
america.
i
grant
you
that
this
is
a
rotten
situation
that
exists
in
most
of
the
states.
and
that
it's
destroying
the
integrity
of
state
government.
but
the
only
way
to
restore
that
integrity
is
to
carry
out
voting
rights
and
that
is
the
very
point
that
we're
making
here.
and
we're
saying
that
under
the
civil
rights
act
that
the
congress
has
done
all
it
can
by
conferring
upon
the
federal
courts
the
power
and
the
duty
to
protect
voting
rights.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1957
in
amending
the
civil
rights
act,
it
quote,
"including
the
right
to
vote",
it
aided
that
specifically.
and
in
1960,
it
added
an
amendment
said
that
the
word
vote
"shall
include
all
measures
necessary
to
make
it
effective."
now,
the
congress
certainly
recognized
that
voting
rights
were
not
being
protected
throughout
the
united
states
of
america.
and
it
deliberately
chose
to
spread
them
the
equity
powers
of
the
federal
courts
as
the
way
to
protect
those
voting
rights,
not
the
state
courts
but
the
federal
courts.
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
that
the
picture
with
respect
to
congressional
representation,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
isn't
the
same.
you
don't
have
people
attacking
the
integrity
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states
of
america
on
the
disproportionate
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
population
thing
which
you
do
in
this
thing.
there's
a
more
compelling
situation
that
exist.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
i
think
though
that
there
is
--
professor
anderson
said
in
the
affidavit
that's
attached
to
the
michigan
brief
amicus
curiae
that
this
thing
is
--
is
very
deep.
this
denial
of
equality
has
gotten
to
the
point
of
ethics
and
where
even
the
school
children
wonder
about
the
morals
of
their
seniors
who
flagrantly
violate
the
state
constitution.
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation
than
the
congressional
situation.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
recently
looked
at
those
and
i'm
merely
saying
to
you
that
this
is
an
entirely
different
situation.
now,
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
this
court
has
never
held
--
it's
never
held
in
any
court
decision
that
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
and
in
smiley
versus
holm,
carroll
versus
becker
and
koenig
versus
flynn,
it
expressly
invalidated
state
reapportionment
statutes
on
the
suits
by
voters.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
of
power,
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
power.
then,
in
colegrove
versus
green,
the
vote
was
four-to-three
for
a
jurisdiction.
i
grant
you,
it
was
four-to-three
differently
composed
not
to
exercise
it
because
it
was
found
that
certain
compelling
circumstances
were
not
there.
but,
since
colegrove
versus
green,
you
do
have
the
fact
that
in
this
1957
act
and
the
1960
act,
the
--
the
--
the
--
the
law
was
changed
and
the
federal
courts
were
told
that
the
action
rather
than
inaction
was
expected
of
them.
and
i
say
to
this
court
on
the
jurisdictional
power
that
this
case
has
all
the
traditional
prerequisites
for
the
exercise
of
equity
power
because
the
1901
act
is
clearly
unlawful.
the
damage
to
these
voters
is
irreparable
and
the
remedy
at
law
is
inadequate.
now
to
refer
these
people
to
a
political
process
which
is
--
is
no
remedy
at
all,
if
you're
going
to
refer
them
to
any
remedy,
it
must
have
a
reasonable
chance
of
being
effective
but
to
refer
these
people
back
to
the
political
process
really
is
a
--
is
a
mockery
of
justice
because
until
voting
rights
are
en
--
enforceable
in
the
federal
courts
and
you
have
equal
or
reasonable
equality,
the
ballot
box
is
no
remedy
for
the
kind
of
situation
that
exist
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
certainly
did
express
--
i
would
address
myself
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
but
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
compelling
circumstances
which
mr.
justice
rutledge
found
absent
in
colegrove
versus
green
are
here
and
that
those
compelling
circumstances
are
these,
number
one,
there
is
a
clear
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
number
two,
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
voting
discrimination
which
is
laid
out
in
this
complaint.
and
the
defendants
offer
no
justification
for
it
and
they
cannot
offer
it
on
these
facts.
and
as
i
have
just
said,
there
is
no
other
remedy.
we're
at
the
end
of
the
road.
if
this
a
judicial
no
man's
land,
these
people,
the
two-thirds
of
the
voters
of
tennessee
are
consigned
to
be
second
class
citizens
for
the
rest
of
their
life
because
these
defendants
exalt
their
position
into
an
untouchable
absolute
justice.
in
gomillion
--
in
gomillion,
the
defendants
there
said,
"well,
you
can't
touch
us
because
a
state
can
carve
up
its
political
subdivisions
anyway
it
wants
to.”
but
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
an
absolute
insofar
as
constitutional
rights
were
concerned.
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
absolute
that
gives
anybody
an
untouchable
right
and
power
to
destroy
voting
rights
in
this
country.
and
true
it
is,
that
was
--
that
was
geographical
discrimination
favoring
i
guess,
i
hate
to
call
it
favoring,
white
as
against
colored.
i
don't
quite
in
--
in
--
interpret
that
as
a
--
as
a
favor
to
the
white.
but
here,
you
have
geographical
demo
--
discrimination
of
even
worse,
more
gruesome
character
of
the
--
discriminating
in
favor
of
the
rural
people
against
the
urban
people.
and
i
say
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america
that
ordains
and
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
the
te
--
of
tennessee
that
ordains
that
state
government
is
and
must
remain
an
agricultural
commodity.
and
there's
nothing
in
neither
one
of
those
constitutions
that
said,
"it
takes
20
city
residents
to
equal
one
farmer.”
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
would
say
the
only
difference
between
kidd
versus
mccanless
on
the
facts
and
here
is
the
fact
that
the
situation
has
grown
worse
since
then
on
the
facts
because
this
thing
has
become
more
and
more
gross
which
i
say
calls
more
and
more
--
is
a
more
and
more
compelling
circumstances
for
relief
here.
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes,
they
weren't
then
and
they
aren't
here.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
as
you
state
the
facts,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
would
agree
with
them.
i
wouldn't
agree
with
any
conclusion
that
the
citation
of
colegrove
versus
green
and
kidd
versus
mccanless
or
any
other
many
cases
that's
been
cited,
stands
for
the
fact
that
this
court
lacks
power
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
to
protect
voting
rights.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
yes.
i
--
but
my
only
point
is
that
this
court
has
never
under
--
in
any
case
that
i
know
of,
have
held
that
it
doesn't
has
--
have
power.
it's
held
that
it
should
not
exercise
power
under
particular
--
under
particular
factual
situations.
and
i
am
saying
that
in
this
case,
the
compelling
circumstances
which
did
not
in
--
exist
in
colegrove
versus
green,
do
exist.
and
one
of
the
compelling
circumstances,
one
of
the
great
differences,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
insist
here
is
that
this
state
legislative
situation
has
reached
the
point
of
a
--
of
a
great
national
tragedy.
and
i
think
that's
a
compelling
thing
because
there
is
no
cure
of
that
other
than
action
by
this
court.
the
legislatures
are
not
going
to
do
anything
about
it.
it's
obvious
that
there's
no
other
remedy
where
--
as
i
say,
we're
at
the
end
of
the
line
and
the
only
way
that
that
situation
can
be
cured
is
by
this
court
enfo
--
enforcing
the
voting
rights
of
these
voters.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think,
mr.
justice
clark
that
congress
has
gone
about
as
far
as
it
can
in
giving
to
the
federal
courts
in
the
1957
and
the
1960
civil
rights
amendment,
a
strengthened
equity
jurisdiction.
and
if
you'll
look
at
the
history
of
those
particular
acts,
they
were
trying
to
protect
votes
no
matter
where
they
were
cast
or
how
they
were
cast
and
the
method
that
congress
shows
was
the
equity
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
now,
i
think
congress
has
gone
about
as
far
as
it
could
because
it
would
have
to
choose
some
agency
other
than
itself
to
do
this
and
it
shows
the
courts.
and
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
and
under
the
compelling
circumstances
of
this
case
not
only
does
the
power
exist
but
it
must
be
exercised
because
either
it's
exercised
are
the
great
right
to
vote
which
is
here
before
this
court
for
either
vindication
or
denial
will
be
denied.
and
i
cannot
imagine
courts,
courts
that
were
created
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
for
the
very
purpose.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
new
jersey.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
well
i
would
not
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
once
they
have
faced
up
to
it,
yes.
now
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
they're
about
--
about
12
of
them.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
now,
that
brings
me
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
black,
it
refused
to
pass
on
that
particular
point.
in
the
record
here
we
have
its
--
its
decision.
and
we
have
also
its
decision.
its
decision
starts
on
page
59.
and
over
on
we
have
also,
it's
--
it's
a
decision
on
rehearing.
because
on
rehearing,
they
asked
the
court
to
pass
on
that
point.
and
over
on
66,
it
says,
“no,
it
was
not
going
to
pass
on
that.
it
didn't
have
to
pass
on
anything
other
than
the
one
point
that
this
would
cause
chaos.”
it
did
not
interpret
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
has
not.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
in
that
case
if
it's
the
browning
case,
mr.
justice
black,
you
held
--
in
my
interpretation
of
--
of
that
opinion
that
the
power
to
classify
railroad
property
--
another
property
existed
in
the
constitution.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
that
this
court
couldn't
find
that
there
was
enough
discrimination
there
to
upset
the
custom
and
upset
that
interpretation.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
now
here
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
that's
--
that's
--
i
think
that
is
true.
now,
on
remedy
--
on
remedy
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i'd
say
it
--
it
certainly
would
be
within
their
power
to
appoint
a
commission.
but
they
have
designated
the
federal
courts
instead.
they
have
even
asked
the
federal
courts
in
--
under
the
1960
act
to
act
as
referees
on
registration
mr.
justice
clark.
so,
i
think
congress
thinks
it's
done
all
it
needs
to
do
because
the
courts
have
been
the
traditional
protectors
of
civil
and
constitutional
rights
and
so
they
referred
this
to
the
courts.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
were
dealing,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
were
dealing
with
the
use
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
protect
the
voting
rights
free
of
the
states.
now,
i'd
like
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
they
did
not
specify
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
were,
i
think,
concerned
also
about
other
citizens
who
were
discriminated
against
in
their
right
to
vote.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
and
others.
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
well,
i
--
i
would
say
they
could
have
this
urban
situation
in
mind
too.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
do
not
--
i
do
not
know
whether
there
is
or
not,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
it's
been
held
--
mr.
justice
harlan's
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that's
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
said
they
didn't
have
to
in
their
opinion
on
rehearing
which
i
cited
to
you.
they
said
they
didn't
have
to
point
--
pass
on
that
point
because
they
had
decided
the
case
under
this
other
point
that
it
would
destroy
the
state
government
if
they
enforced
these
voting
rights.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
it
would
and
it's
here.
now,
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
remedy
and
my
time
is
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
they
said
the
latter
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
i
think
it
indicated
that
there
was
power
to
classify
there
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
i'd
better
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
--
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no,
there
was
not
an
argument
about
it
being
politics
there
as
far
as
i
know
mr.
justice
black
in
my
reading
of
it.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
time?
