mr.
jack
wilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
three-judge
district
court.
a
question
was
raised
yesterday
as
to
the
duty
of
this
court
on
this
field.
it
is
the
insistence
of
the
appellees
here
that
this
court
must
consider
at
least
three
things.
one
of
those
is
whether
this
case
is
justiciable.
the
court
must
make
that
determination.
if
the
case
is
justiciable
then
this
court
must
determine
whether
the
federal
district
court
had
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
there
is,
in
our
view,
a
difference.
a
case
maybe
justiciable
insofar
as
the
parties
are
concerned
but
not
as
to
the
subject
matter
or
the
court
might
find
that
it
is
justiciable
as
to
the
subject
matter,
but
the
proper
parties
are
not
before
the
court.
and
then
a
matter
of
great
importance
to
the
appellees
and
to
the
state
of
tennessee
for
determination
by
this
court
and
i
think
perhaps
the
most
important
question
if
the
federal
district
court
has
any
jurisdiction
is
what
relief,
if
any,
maybe
granted
by
the
federal
district
court.
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
early
in
the
argument
yesterday
if
i
understood
him,
said
this.
“if
we
determine
that
there
is
jurisdiction,
need
this
court
concern
itself
with
the
question
of
relief”
and
the
appellees
say
that
this
court
must
of
necessity
concern
itself
with
the
question
of
relief.
now,
general
glasgow
has,
in
some
detail,
considered
the
question
of
whether
the
case
is
justiciable
from
the
standpoint
of
the
appellants,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
appellees
and
from
the
stand
point
of
the
subject
matter
to
the
extent
of
whether
it
is
or
is
not
political.
at
this
time,
i
wish
to
address
myself
to
the
subject
of
the
nature
of
the
subject
matter
of
this
suit
insofar
as
jurisdiction
is
concerned.
now,
i
think
it
goes
without
question
that
the
subject
matter
of
a
lawsuit
is
to
be
determining
not
necessarily
on
some
technical
basis
but
from
a
practical
standpoint.
what
is
the
frame
of
the
complaint
in
this
case?
what
is
this
case
about?
well,
on
the
surface,
on
the
face
of
it,
there
is
an
averment
here
of
a
violation
of
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
civil
rights
statutes,
but
that
is
not
the
nature
of
the
complaint.
if
the
nature
of
the
complaint
was
a
violation
of
personal
rights,
the
appellants
would
cite
this
court,
invoke
some
statute
having
to
do
with
voting.
they
do
not
do
that.
they
invoked
as
statute
having
to
do
with
representation
in
the
legislature
of
tennessee.
what
does
the
complaint
have
to
say
or
ask
in
the
way
of
relief?
is
it
that
an
injunction
be
issued
by
the
federal
district
court
to
require
these
appellants
to
permit
these
appellants
to
register?
is
it
that
their
votes
be
counted?
is
it
that
they'd
be
permitted
to
enter
the
polling
places?
no
such
thing,
no
such
thing.
what
is
the
relief
asked
for?
well,
a
declaration
as
to
their
constitutional
rights,
and
what
else?
that
the
next
election
or
members
legislature
in
the
state
of
tennessee
be
enjoined.
that's
the
nature
of
the
action,
or
they
say
that
there
be
an
election
at
large.
it
is
the
appellees'
contention,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
this
case
does
not
involve
private
rights,
that
it
cannot
involve
private
rights.
we
concede
and
very
readily
that
there
is
a
right
under
the
constitution
of
tennessee
for
all
citizens
to
have
the
type
of
government
provided
by
the
constitution
of
tennessee.
but
we
say
that
that
is
not
a
personal
right
in
the
sense
that
it
can
be
enforced
by
an
individual
voter.
it
is
a
constitutional
right,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
in
response
to
your
question
but
it
is
not
an
enforceable
right
in
the
courts
under
the
law
and
constitution
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
jack
wilson
simply
because
of
the
division
of
powers
under
our
constitution,
may
it
please
hour
honor.
the
--
our
state
court
will
not
entertain
the
suit.
they
say
it's
political.
they
say
it's
in
the
legislative
field.
they
say
they
could
not
enforce
the
right
and
that
is
the
position
under
the
tennessee
constitution.
it
is
not
a
personal
right
that
can
be
enforced
in
our
courts.
and
i
think
that
for
whatever
reasons,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
may
have
found
that
to
be
true,
we
believe
that
this
court
will
and
must,
since
it
is
a
state
right
under
our
state
constitution,
accept
the
view
of
our
supreme
court.
now,
if
that
is
true
and
we
can
do
no
more
than
to
ask
the
court
at
this
stage
to
take
our
assertion
that
it
is
true
then
the
question
does
not
involve
anything
having
to
do
with
the
weight
of
a
ballot
at
the
ballot
box.
now,
i
am
aware
that
this
court
has
in
the
past
that
is
to
see
at
least
two
members
and
two
members
of
the
court
now
sitting,
have
said
that
they
can
see
no
difference
between
a
ballot
cast
in
the
--
at
the
ballot
box,
literally,
metal,
plastic
whatever
it
is
and
the
effect
that
that
ballot
has
in
the
legislature
of
a
state.
the
appellees
say
to
this
honorable
court
that
that
theory
that
that
insistence,
and
we
respect
it,
must
in
this
case
be
reexamined.
it
must
be
examined
microscopically.
the
case
may
and
could
turn
on
that
question.
now,
what
is
their
difference?
is
there
a
difference?
we
think
so.
it
said
that
if
a
citizen
cast
his
ballot
for
three
state
senators
when
he
should
be
allowed
to
cast
his
ballot
for
six
state
senators
that
his
right
to
vote
has
been
denied,
we
respectfully
disagree
with
that
contention.
we
say
that
that
ballot
cast
in
the
state
of
tennessee
is
put
in
that
ballot
box,
it
is
carried,
it
is
counted
as
all
other
ballots
are
counted.
now,
the
case
is
with
which
this
court
has
been
concerned,
nixon
against
herndon,
the
terry
case,
these
other
cases
have
been
cases
where
the
--
the
voter
was
not
permitted
to
put
his
ballot
in
the
box
or
if
he
put
it
in
the
box,
it
was
fraudulently
counted
or
not
counted
at
all.
what's
the
situation
in
tennessee?
it
is
not
at
the
polls.
the
vote
of
which
complaint
is
made
is
in
the
legislative
halls
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
as
to
jurisdiction?
what
difference
does
it
make
as
to
whether
the
case
is
justiciable?
it
makes
this
difference.
is
there
a
private
personal
right
involved
at
the
ballot
box?
if
there
is
not,
what
does
the
civil
rights
statutes
as
to
voting
have
to
do
with
this
case?
what
do
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
to
voting
have
to
do
with
this
case
if
the
complaint
is
in
the
general
assembly
of
tennessee,
in
the
halls
and
not
at
the
polling
places?
that
is
one
of
the
decisive
issues
in
this
case.
now,
what
has
this
court
done
heretofore
as
to
those
issues?
it
has
recognized
that
distinction,
has
consistently
held
from
colegrove
case
up
to
this
very
minute
while
i
speak
that
there
is
a
difference.
cases
from
california,
from
georgia,
from
pennsylvania,
from
oklahoma
have
been
before
this
court
and
this
court
has
refused
almost
all
of
the
time,
even
to
hear
the
cases
on
the
merits.
and
this
court
has
said
citing
the
colegrove
decision
that
no
federal
question
--
substantial
federal
question
is
involved.
and
this
court
said
in
kidd
against
mccanless,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
there
was
no
federal
question,
substantial
federal
question
and
that
case
involved
the
identical
statutes,
the
identical
facts
and
almost
the
identical
parties.
now,
what
about
these
other
state
constitutions
where
this
honorable
court
had
said
that
there's
no
substantial
federal
question?
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
constitution
of
pennsylvania.
that
case
has
been
before
this
court
and
within
recent
years.
under
that
constitution
like
the
constitution
of
tennessee,
there
is
a
provision
almost
identical
saying
that
election
shall
be
free
and
equal.
this
court
wouldn't
hear
the
case.
it
wouldn't
even
set
it
down
for
argument.
what
else
is
in
the
constitution
of
pennsylvania?
well,
up
there,
may
it
please
the
court,
they
have
a
specific
provision
in
their
constitution
that
municipality
shall
be
entitled
to
extra
representation
in
their
legislature
and
they
have
said
in
the
suit
brought
as
i
understood
it,
that
those
municipalities
still
didn't
have
the
representation
they
should
have
because
of
malapportionment,
but
this
court
refused
to
hear
the
cases.
with
that
type
of
provision
in
the
constitution,
and
tennessee
has
no
such
provisions
there,
what
about
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
and
that
case
was
before
this
court.
somewhat
interestingly
and
surprisingly
to
us
in
tennessee,
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
has
a
provision
that
the
reapportionment
statutes
in
that
constitution
may
be
affirmatively
enforced
in
the
courts
of
oklahoma.
that
case
came
before
this
honorable
court.
the
court
wouldn't
hear
it,
the
court
wouldn't
hear
it
wouldn't
even
--
let
it
be
argued.
mr.
jack
wilson
it
was
filed
in
a
three-judge
federal
district
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
they
sustained
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
jack
wilson
no,
it
was
not
brought
in
the
state
court,
may
it
please
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
your
honor,
the
--
mr.
jack
wilson
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
are
entirely
correct.
the
constitution
does
so
provide
but
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
elected
to
bring
it
not
in
the
state
court
but
in
the
federal
court.
but
the
question
is
important
for
the
reason
that
there,
the
citizens
of
oklahoma
had
determined
that
the
apportionment
provision
in
that
statute
was
either
mandatory
or
was
self-executing
and
that
its
provisions
might
be
enforced
in
a
court
of
law
or
equity.
and
such
is
not
true
in
tennessee.
on
the
contrary,
our
court
has
held
that
it
cannot
enter
the
field.
and
of
course
one
of
the
questions
for
this
honorable
court
is,
“if
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
held
under
our
own
constitution
that
it
cannot
enter
the
field,
will
this
court
enter
the
field?”
and
i
say
to
the
court
that
it
is
not
only
a
--
a
serious
question
and
an
interesting
question
but
one
of
great
importance
in
the
operation
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
now,
i
wish
to
discuss
two
additional
points
in
the
time
remaining
and
those
points,
the
appellees
consider
of
utmost
importance
and
i
believe
have
not
been
touched
upon
up
to
this
point.
let
us
assume
that
this
court
should
refuse
to
accept
the
appellees'
insistence
here
that
this
is
not
a
personal
and
private
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
let
us
assume
that
this
court
should
find
that
this
is
a
personal
right.
we're
assuming
this.
the
appellees
take
the
opposite
view
as
i
have
said
repeatedly.
what
would
be
the
basis
for
--
for
finding
that
some
federal
right
was
involved?
and
of
course,
unless
there
is
a
federal
right,
this
case
is
not
--
this
court
is
not
concerned
with
the
case.
what
would
the
personal
or
private
right
be
under
the
constitution
of
tennessee
--
of
the
united
states?
of
course,
reliance
has
had
upon
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
since
there
is
no
question
here
about
voting
now
under
our
insistence,
what
would
the
right
involved?
well,
necessarily,
under
our
view,
it
would
involve
a
right
to
equality
of
representation
in
a
state
legislature.
that
would
be
the
type
of
right
that
this
court
would
have
to
find,
was
protected
by
the
federal
constitution.
now,
has
this
honorable
court
ever
so
held
up
to
this
time?
it
has
not.
it
has
held
that
the
right
to
vote
for
a
state
officer,
the
right
of
representation
in
a
state
legislative
body
is
purely
a
state
right.
we
think
that
that
is
sound.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
did
hold
that
the
right
to
have
a
vote
counted
at
the
--
the
vote
counted
at
the
ballot
box,
and
there
seems
to
be
no
question
about
that.
and
i
would
like
to
say
and
emphasize
that
any
citizen
of
tennessee
who
has
the
right
to
vote
in
a
state
election
in
tennessee
under
our
theory
and
insistence,
has
the
right
to
have
the
vote
that
he
puts
in
the
ballot
box
counted
when
it's
taken
out
of
the
ballot
box,
that
most
assuredly
is
a
state
right.
now,
your
honor
has
reference
to
the
classic
in
saylor
cases.
those
cases
involved
literally
a
denial
of
the
franchise
at
the
ballot
box,
not
in
a
legislative
hall.
now,
returning
if
i
may
to
the
question
here
of
whether
that
is
a
federal
right.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
if
there
is
a
federal
right
here
as
to
the
extent
of
representation
in
a
state
legislature,
it
arises
and
may
arise
under
the
frame
of
this
complaint
only
by
the
route
of
discrimination.
and
i
daresay
that
most
actions
laid
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
come
--
would
follow
that
route
of
discrimination.
now,
let's
get
down
to
bad
route
on
this
thing.
if
there
is
discrimination
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
will
it
bear
examination?
well,
you're
going
to
have
discrimination,
you're
going
to
have
to
treat
one
class
different
from
another
class,
i
think.
now,
it's
recognized
in
sound
law
that
of
course
there
maybe
–
classification
under
state
law.
is
there
discrimination
between
classes
where
there
is
unequal
representation
in
the
state
legislature
and
this
case
may
turn
on
that?
this
case
may
turn
on
that
very
point.
we
say
not.
we
say
that
that
can't
be
discrimination
in
the
usual
sense.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
let
me
give
you
one
illustration
and
i
think
this
is
important.
it
said
that
according
to
the
appellants
here
that
if
this
thing
goes
through
the
ballot
box.
we
say
it
does.
we
say
it's
in
the
legislative
hall.
now,
the
reason
we
say
it
can't
be
discrimination
is
this.
the
effect
of
inadequate
representation
in
the
legislative
halls
has
no
direct
casual
connection
with
whether
the
person
affected
cast
his
ballot
or
did
not
cast.
now,
many
of
our
states
and
some
of
our
border
states
give
18-year
of
citizens
the
right
to
vote.
tennessee
does
not.
what
is
the
status
of
a
citizen
in
tennessee
18
years
old,
19
years
old,
20
years
old,
who
under
the
law
of
tennessee
does
not
have
the
right
to
vote
and
yet
he
is
very
greatly
affected
as
a
citizen
by
what
the
legislature
does
in
the
halls
of
the
general
assembly
of
tennessee.
is
there
discrimination
as
to
him?
if
so,
when
and
where
did
it
arise?
then
the
question
comes
up,
if
there's
discrimination
here,
an
unlawful
discrimination?
was
it
purposeful?
is
it
purposeful
and
intentional?
can
that
be
shown
where
there
is
unequal
--
inequitable
representation
when
the
involvement
is
that
it's
due
not
to
an
affirmative
act
of
the
legislature,
but
to
the
passage
of
time
and
shifts
in
population.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
very
seriously
insist
that
there
is
not
and
cannot
be
any
discrimination
in
this
case.
it
isn't
a
case
involving
voting.
the
right
to
representation
in
a
state
legislature
is
not
protected
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
the
right
to
vote
might
be,
the
right
to
vote
at
polls.
we
say
that
the
civil
rights
act
is
confined
literally
to
the
right
to
vote
at
the
polls
and
that
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
due
to
the
limitation
in
time,
i
must
take
up
our
final
and
perhaps
most
important,
certainly,
equally,
important
point
from
the
standpoint
of
the
appellees.
now
may
it
please
the
court,
and
that
is
the
question
of
relief,
i
invite
the
court's
attention
and
i
do
not
want
this
repetition
to
be
offensive
and
i
hope
that
it
isn't.
the
real
party
in
interest
in
this
case
in
tennessee
is
not
before
the
court.
that's
the
legislature
of
tennessee.
it's
their
action
or
their
inaction
of
which
complaint
is
made.
there
is
no
complaint
incidentally
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
it,
there
is
no
complaint
as
to
anyone
of
the
appellees
before
the
court.
it
is
averred
that
they
have
done
anything,
they
shouldn't
have
done.
that
it
is
averred
when
the
court
gets
into
the
case
and
the
tennessee
law
that
there
is
anything
that
any
of
these
appellees
could
do.
and
that
of
course
again
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
case
is
justiciable.
but
since
the
legislature
of
tennessee
is
not
before
this
court,
either
actually
or
figuratively,
the
appellees
who
are
before
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
tennessee
do
think
it
proper,
do
think
it
important
to
discuss
the
question
of
relief
and
certainly
that
would
be
most
important
if
this
case
is
sent
back
to
the
three
--
three-judge
district
court.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
three
principal
suggestions
here
as
to
relief.
as
we
view
the
case,
it
will
be
the
duty
of
this
court
to
determine
whether
any
one
of
those
three
maybe
granted
or
if
not,
whether
some
other
possible
type
of
relief
could
be
granted
in
the
event
the
court
finds
that
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
first
subject
suggested
relief
by
the
appellants
here
is
that
there
be
a
declaration,
that
the
apportionment
statutes
in
tennessee
are
unconstitutional.
what
would
be
the
effect
of
a
declaration
by
the
federal
district
court
at
the
reappor
--
the
apportionment
statutes
of
tennessee
are
unconstitutional.
we
connected
--
the
appellees
connected
with
the
government
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
take
the
position
that
the
effect
would
be
and
must
of
necessity
be
that
the
government
of
the
state
of
tennessee
is
operating
unconstitutionally.
i
submit
that
there
could
be
no
other
reasonable
conclusion.
the
federal
district
court
let
it
say,
makes
that
declaration
and
as
its
decree,
what
does
the
state
of
tennessee
and
its
government
can
do?
it's
operating
unconstitutionally.
can
it,
aside
from
the
rule
in
luther
against
borden,
the
old
case
discussed
a
moment
ago,
upon
the
declaration
being
entered,
the
decree,
what
may
the
state
of
tennessee
do
as
to
let
us
say
the
operation
of
its
courts?
if
the
government
is
operating
unconstitutionally,
may
it
continue
to
sentence
defendants
in
criminal
courts,
may
it?
may
it
continue
to
pay
its
school
teachers?
it's
an
unconstitutional
government
at
that
time.
may
it
pay
its
judges?
may
it
maintain
its
hospitals
for
the
mentally
ill?
what
happens
to
the
state
of
tennessee
upon
that
declaration?
well,
of
all
practical
purposes
and
i
might
–
i
pause
here
to
say
that
this
is
not
theoretical,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter,
when
you
are
directly
connected
with
the
operation
of
a
state
government.
suppose
the
state
of
tennessee
had
planned
to
execute
a
defendant
in
a
capital
case
on
the
day
following
the
declaration
entered
by
the
three-judge
district
court.
what
would
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee
advise
the
warden
of
a
state
penitentiary
as
to
carrying
out
that
execution?
frankly,
i
don't
know.
i
hope
the
question
doesn't
arise.
the
question
will
not
arise
if
no
such
declaration
is
made
by
a
federal
district
court
and
that
is
one
reason
why
and
an
important
reason
why
from
a
practical
standpoint
that
we
say
the
federal
district
court
should
not
enter
any
such
decree.
this
is
a
matter
for
settlement
by
the
citizens
of
tennessee.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
my
time
--
very
little
remains,
there
are
two
other
proportions.
it
is
said,
“let's
enjoin
the
next
election
for
the
legislature
of
tennessee,
let's
enjoin
it.”
who
enjoins?
not
a
state
court,
not
a
court
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
a
federal
district
court
enjoining
a
state
election
or
state
officers,
has
it
ever
been
done
in
the
history
of
the
united
states?
would
this
court
send
this
case
back
with
directions
to
the
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
the
next
election
of
members
of
the
legislature
in
the
state
of
tennessee,
actually,
not?
i
cannot
believe
you
will
do
it.
what
is
the
third
suggested
--
mr.
jack
wilson
in
an
entirely
different
aspect,
may
it
please
the
court.
that
case
had
to
do
with
sending
the
national
guard
of
the
state
of
tennessee
to
the
polling
places
in
one
of
the
counties.
mr.
jack
wilson
but
there
was
no
question
of
enjoining
a
state
election
and
i
believe
that
there
never
would
be
by
a
federal
district
judge
who
was
familiar
with
the
tennessee
law.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
third
suggested
remedy
is
this.
when
i
have
an
election
at
large,
let
the
federal
district
court
say
we
will
ignore
these
reapportionment
statutes.
let's
hold
an
election
at
large.
well
now,
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
has
said
that
the
constitution
of
tennessee
has
no
provision
whatsoever
for
the
holding
of
an
election
at
large
for
members
of
the
legislature.
the
federal
district
court
found
that
to
be
true
and
the
federal
district
court
went
further
and
said
that
to
permit
the
holding
of
an
election
at
large
would,
could
and
probably
would
result
in
greater
inequities
than
now
exists.
and
as
was
suggested
here
by
a
question
of
one
others
members
of
this
court,
the
effect
of
that
election
at
large
more
than
likely
would
be
simply
to
reverse
the
situation.
the
urban
representatives
would
take
over
and
be
largely
in
the
majority,
it
would
be
just
a
flip
of
a
coin
at
that
time.
mr.
jack
wilson
not
mathematically,
may
it
please
the
court,
but
i
think
from
a
practical
standpoint
and
psychologically
if
i
may
use
that
word.
now,
what
is
the
--
to
happen
about
this?
what
is
the
remedy?
it's
averred
here
that
the
legislature
of
tennessee
has
taken
no
action
for
60
years.
if
i
maybe
permitted
to
go
outside
the
record
momentarily,
the
legislature
of
tennessee
which
adjourned
the
17th
day
of
march,
did
take
some
action.
it
has
not
reapportioned.
whether
the
legislature
of
tennessee
will
reapportion
within
the
next
few
years,
i
do
not
know,
but
it
did
pass
a
resolution
to
require
an
enumeration
of
the
qualified
voters
under
the
constitution.
it
did
pass
a
resolution
to
study
the
subject.
that
fact
will
have
no
bearing
nor
it's
not
persuasive
with
this
court
but
i
simply
mention
it
as
a
matter
of
information.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
wilson
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
jack
wilson
indeed,
there
are.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
that's
the
only
way,
your
honor.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
in
conclusion,
we
think
that
this
case
in
addition
to
the
points
discussed,
we
hope
and
believe
thoroughly
does
involve
this.
there
is
not
only
a
question
here
of
the
enforcement
or
possible
enforcement
of
state
rights
by
a
federal
court.
there
is
also
the
question
of
whether
the
judiciary,
and
in
this
instance
federal
judiciary,
will
step
over
into
the
legislative
field.
those
are
two
very
serious
questions.
now,
we
think
that
from
time
immemorial,
citizens
of
tennessee
like
all
other
americans
have
been
proud
of
their
state.
we
believe
that
the
citizens
of
tennessee
can
take
care
of
this
problem
and
will
take
care
of
it.
we
say
that
for
this
court
to
send
this
case
back
to
the
federal
district
court
saying
that
that
court
has
jurisdiction
and
that
that
court
may
grant
relief
is
authorized
to
do
so
that
that
would
be
a
little
short
of
putting
the
state
of
tennessee
in
a
political
or
governmental
receivership.
i
think
it
would
be
a
little
short
of
that.
i
think
it
would
be
saying
that
the
people
of
tennessee
incapable
of
self-government
and
that
they
cannot
and
never
will
be
able
to
solve
this
problem.
mr.
jack
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
told
that
a
few
months
ago
at
the
theological
school
of
one
of
the
great
universities
in
the
east,
a
most
interesting
discussion
was
held.
the
discussion
of
senator
(inaudible),
the
parable
of
the
good
samaritan
and
as
we
lawyers
would
say
that
was
a
particular
feast
of
that
parable
under
discussion.
the
story
is
that
the
particular
point
was
why
did
the
levite
and
the
priest
both
passed
by
that
certain
man
who
had
fallen
among
thieves?
a
theologian
of
national
eminence
leading
the
discussion
and
evidently
he
was
the
man
of
the
world
as
well
as
a
man
of
the
church
and
he
gave
this
response.
he
says,
“i
think
the
trouble
was
this,
both
the
priest
and
the
levite
were
en
route
to
a
conference
to
discuss
the
question
who
is
a
good
samaritan?”
i
suggest,
may
it
please
the
court
that
did
--
that
in
this
most
important
case
that
the
solicitor
general
and
the
appellants
are
perhaps
en
route
to
a
conference
to
discuss
constitutional
law.
i
suggest
that
up
to
this
point,
they
have
not
discussed
nor
touched
upon
some
of
the
great
principles
with
--
with
which
this
court
has
been
concerned
throughout
its
entire
history.
now,
reference
has
been
made
here
as
to
whether
this
case
is
justiciable.
actually,
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
come
to
that
phase
of
the
case?
isn't
it
this?
is
this
a
case
of
controversies
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
if
it
isn't
then
this
court
is
not
concerned
with
it
in
any
particular.
now
what
--
what
is
a
case
of
controversy?
well,
what
--
why
do
we
have
that
provision
in
the
constitution?
were
not
--
were
not
our
colonial
judges
concerning
themselves
with
a
great
deal
of
matters
and
subjects
that
were
not
judicial
in
nature?
as
the
priest
is
used
in
the
market
place
today,
was
they
not
politicking?
or
when
they
found
this
team
to
write
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
they
said
that
the
judiciary
would
be
concerned
with
cases
and
controversies
unlike
some
of
the
subjects,
the
colonial
judges
were
concerned
with.
i
wish
to
call
this
court's
attention
to
the
complaint
in
this
case.
and
i
think
you
test
the
complaint
not
alone
by
their
votes
but
by
the
type
of
relief
that
is
asked.
mr.
jack
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
shortly
before
the
recess,
i
had
stated
to
the
court
that
it
was
the
appellee's
view
that
in
this
case
of
great
importance
not
only
to
the
state
of
tennessee
but
to
the
united
states
of
america
that
there
are
law
and
all
certain
great
constitutional
principles
here
involved
not
mentioned
by
the
appellants
which
must
certainly
should
be
considered
by
this
honorable
court.
i
had
mentioned
the
question
of
whether
this
case
is
a
case
or
controversy
whether
it
does
present
issues
for
this
court.
i
had
mentioned
and
i
now
ask
the
court
to
consider
the
question
of
what
the
subject
matter
of
this
suit
is.
the
appellants
have
said
in
two
arguments
that
this
is
a
case
of
individual
voting
rights.
i
take
it
may
it
please
the
court
that
if
this
is
not
a
case
of
individual
voting
rights
then
the
appellants
must
concede
that
there
is
no
case
for
this
court.
what
does
the
complaint
over
here?
well,
it
says
it's
been
denied
to
write
vote
but
you
turnover
next
page
and
they
said,
"oh
no,"
it's
--
it's
an
inadequate
legislative
representation,
well,
which
is
you
turnover
another
page,
they
say
it's
improper
and
inevitable
distribution
of
taxes.
now,
let's
look
at
the
trials
of
the
complaint.
i
think
that
it
should
be
one
of
the
surest
tasks
they
have
for
the
reason
that
a
practitioner
at
the
bar
for
instance
does
not
bring
a
suit
for
damages
based
on
negligence
and
free
for
an
absolute
divorce.
his
trial
must
be
consistent
with
his
complaint.
a
practitioner
certainly
does
not
ask
that
a
written
answer
be
reformed
and
then
pray
that
a
cooperation
be
dissolved.
oh
no,
the
relief
ask
in
this
case
is
that
the
legislature
of
tennessee
be
real
portioned.
the
relief
asked
is
that
an
election
at
large
be
held.
now,
may
it
please
the
court
if
this
isn't
individual
voting
rights
case
and
i
wish
to
discuss
that
still
above
in
my
argument
a
little
later.
why
is
there
not
a
prayer
somewhere
in
the
complaint
that
these
appellants
be
permitted
to
ridge
to
say
or
that
these
appellants
permitted
to
put
their
votes
in
the
ballot
box?
oh
no,
that
if
not
in
this
complaint.
so
what
is
this
lawsuit
if
--
if
we
must
--
if
the
court
must
determine
whether
there
is
a
case
and
controversy,
what
is
the
subject
matter
of
the
lawsuit?
well,
it's
legislative
representation.
it's
legislative
representation.
and
how
there
have
the
court's
turned
it?
is
this
something
just
being
suggested
by
the
appellees
here?
oh
no,
the
district
court
said
this,
"the
question
of
the
distribution
of
political
strength
for
legislative
purposes,
not
to
vote,
not
the
right
to
vote."
what
did
this
court
say
in
south
against
peters?
how
did
it
turned
the
question?
the
geographical
distribution
of
electro
restraint
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
this
suit.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
asked
that
the
court
consider
one
of
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
the
brief
coleman
against
miller
in
307
u.s.
and
i
wish
to
discuss
those
facts
a
little
bit
later
if
time
permits,
but
i
called
this
court's
attention
at
this
time
to
an
opinion
by
one
of
the
three
judges
who
were
sitting
at
that
time
and
are
now
on
this
court.
and
that's
the
opinion,
concurring
opinion
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
black
specifically
concurred
and
that
opinion
is
trace
the
subject
of
the
subject
matter
to
be
considered
by
our
federal
court
under
the
constitutional
provision
permitting
federal
courts
to
hear
cases
and
controversies.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
that
opinion
much
little
of
the
century
yet
to
come.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court
in
that
opinion
which
is
the
opinion
of
three
members
of
this
court
now
sitting.
the
court
discusses
the
subject
of
what
type
matters
the
federal
courts
hear
and
what
is
the
first
length
that
said
that
traditional
matters
that
was
--
of
concerned
at
the
courts
of
westminster,
oh,
at
the
colonial
judges,
the
courts
of
england
from
which
the
columnist
had
come.
and
what
else
is
said
in
that
opinion
that
the
subject
matter
must
held
the
expert
field
of
the
lawyer.
the
expert
field
of
the
lawyers,
as
a
trial
lawyer
in
the
courts
of
tennessee
day
in
and
day
out
as
one
who
is
concern
with
procedure,
with
practice,
with
the
weight
to
elegance,
there
are
many
questions
in
this
case
which
concern
me
because
they
do
not
have
the
expert
field
of
the
lawyer.
what
is
the
injury
in
this
case
incidentally?
what
is
the
injury
that
survived?
the
inequitable
distribution
of
state
tax
bonds
is
that
legal
cloth
for
the
judiciary
to
cut?
as
a
trial
or
lawyer,
how
would
you
prove
in
a
court
of
equity
that
taxes
are
inequitably
distributed?
in
tennessee,
and
our
state
chancery
courts
and
we
have
courts
of
equity,
separate
courts
of
law.
we
may
have
a
jury
in
the
state
chancery
court.
how
would
a
trial
judge
charge
a
jury
on
what
constitutes
the
inequitable
distribution
of
state
taxes?
is
this
a
type
of
issue
that
this
court
or
any
federal
court
will
have?
i
suggest
not.
what
else
has
this
court
said?
and
it
was
mentioned
in
the
period
before
lunch,
this
court
has
said
that
it
will
not
give
the
advisory
opinion.
perhaps
the
outstanding
example
in
the
early
history
of
this
court
and
it
is
said
out
in
one
of
the
great
opinions
for
this
court
is
the
reply
of
mr.
chief
justice
jay
to
president
george
washington
who
had
called
upon
this
honorable
court
for
legal
advised.
the
response
is
firmed,
its
accordance,
its
specificity.
but
in
short,
mr.
chief
justice
jay
informed
the
first
president
of
the
united
states
that
this
court
was
in
the
business
to
decide
cases
and
not
to
give
advice,
and
it
has
ever
been
such
from
that
day
until
this
day.
now,
may
it
please
the
court
another
one
of
the
great
constitutional
principles
with
which
this
court
is
here
concern
is
the
question
of
sovereign
immunity,
sovereign
immunity.
i
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
page
115
of
the
printed
record.
i
believe
the
pages
at
that
point
are
not
in
proper
sequence
but
they
are
properly
numbered,
page
115.
midway
of
that
page
begins
a
letter.
the
letter
is
written
by
two
of
the
counsels
for
the
appellants
in
this
case.
that
letter
is
addressed
to
the
legislature
of
tennessee.
and
what
does
that
letter
say?
watch
out
mr.
members
of
the
legislature
if
you
do
not
reapportion,
we
will
file
a
lawsuit.
members
of
this
court
ever
see
such
a
letter?
i
never
saw
one
before.
what
does
that
indicate
to
the
lawyer?
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
expert
field
of
a
lawyer?
why
it's
a
legislative
matter.
it's
a
legislative
matter.
why
was
this
letter
not
addressed
to
the
secretary
of
the
state
of
tennessee?
why
was
this
letter
not
addressed
to
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee?
because
there's
no
issue
with
those
who
had
issue
or
with
any
of
the
other
appellee
mount
before
the
court.
the
issue
is
with
the
legislature
of
tennessee.
what
does
that
mean
then?
it
means
that
this
is
an
issue
not
with
these
appellees
before
the
court.
it's
an
issue
with
the
sovereign
state
of
tennessee,
one
of
the
biggest
states.
well,
count
me
out,
count
me
out,
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it?
we
are
doing
this,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
in
opposing
the
plea
of
sovereignty
on
behalf
of
the
sovereign
state
of
tennessee
that
it
has
not
in
its
constitution
by
statute
or
otherwise
given
its
consent
to
be
sued
in
the
federal
district
court
on
a
reapportion
matter.
does
the
eleventh
amendment
apply
here?
if
it
does,
what
is
its
significance?
well,
i
think
surely
on
that
ground
alone
that
this
suit,
this
appeal
would
have
to
be
dismissed.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
we
come
to
another
great
constitutional
principle
and
that
is
the
principle
of
separation
of
powers,
and
that
is
mentioned
only
incidentally
by
the
appellant,
i
wonder
why.
did
they
think
it
not
applicable
or
did
they
wish
not
to
bring
it
into
the
open?
it
may
be
decisive
of
this
case,
it
could
be.
now,
what
--
what
about
the
separation
of
powers?
well,
this
court
has
said
that
the
founders,
the
writers
of
the
constitution
would
not
doctrinaires.
and
i
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
and
the
members
of
this
honorable
court
are
not
doctrinaires.
let's
look
for
a
moment,
a
very
brief
moment
at
the
declaration
of
independence.
perhaps
one
of
the
greatest
governmental
indictments
ever
drawn,
let's
look
at
some
of
the
counts
in
that
indictment.
what
did
the
sign
has
say
to
that?
george
iii
is
speaking
of,
he
has
called
together
legislative
bodies
and
places
unused.
he
has
dissolved
representative
houses
repeatedly.
oh,
were
the
columnists
concerned
with
someone
mentally
with
legislative?
it
seemed
so,
it
seemed
so.
now
at
this
point,
may
it
please
the
court,
may
i
pause
just
a
moment
to
respond
to
one
of
the
appellants
in
systems
at
here
that
one
type
of
relief
in
this
case
might
be
for
this
court
to
remand
the
case
to
the
federal
district
court
and
in
substance
do
nothing.
what
does
that
mean?
it
means
that
the
appellants
would
have
a
three
judge
--
three
judge
district
courts
sitting
here,
eyeing
132
members
of
the
tennessee
general
--
general
assembly
each
seeing
which
will
make
the
first
move.
is
that
the
way
this
government
of
ours
operates?
not
under
the
separation
of
powers.
i
suggest
that
we
never
reach
that
point,
but
what
is
that?
that's
coercion
and
some
of
the
newspapers
of
tennessee
and
now
editorials
have
said,
"yes,
it's
coercion
and
that's
what
we
want.
that's
what
we
must
have."
is
it
true?
is
it
so?
if
this
court
will
take
one
defends,
a
misdemeanor
case,
a
felony
case,
and
set
aside
the
conviction
because
of
a
confession
obtained
by
coercion,
would
this
court
lend
its
sympathy
to
coercing
a
state
legislative
body
where
the
rights
of
3.5
million
people
were
involved?
i
suggest
not,
i
suggest
not.
what
does
that
involve?
does
it
involve
the
integrity
and
honesty
of
individual
judges?
oh
no,
oh
no.
that
is
the
question.
it
involves
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
refinement
of
the
united
states
of
america.
if
this
is
a
matter
with
which
the
federal
courts
are
concerned,
let
the
decree
be
in
it.
let
it
be
executed
simply
and
surely,
and
we,
in
tennessee,
have
great
respect
for
our
federal
district
court.
but
if
this
is
not
legal
calls
to
be
cut
by
the
federal
judiciary,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
the
federal
judiciary
should
not
undertake
to
suggest
to
the
tennessee
legislature
or
to
come
right
up
to
its
face
and
say,
"watch
out!"
if
you
don't
reapportion,
oh,
we'll
see
what
it
would
do.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
the
american
way.
it
certainly
is
not
the
judicial
way
of
handling
controversy.
what
did
hamilton
have
to
say
on
this
subject
of
separation
of
powers?
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
federal
released,
number
51
where
hamilton
writing
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
to
why
they
should
adopt
and
approve
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
as
proposed.
hamilton
said
this,
"ambition
must
be
made
to
counteract
ambition."
and
then
he
seemed
somewhat
self-conscious
and
his
writing.
he
said,
oh
well
he
says,
"you
know
that
may
sound
like
a
reflection
on
human
nature."
and
then
he
picked
up
again
and
he
said
this,
"what
is
government
itself
but
the
greatest
of
all
are
reflections
of
human
nature."
and
then
he
defined
what
must
be
true
now
and
certainly
was
then
in
framing
a
government
which
is
to
be
administered
by
man
over
man,
you
must
do
two
things.
first,
you
must
enable
the
government
to
control
the
government,
and
in
the
next
place
oblige
it
to
control
itself.
now,
may
it
please
the
court
in
the
great
case
of
miles
against
united
states
and
the
court
will
recall
as
its
being
the
postmaster
case
considerable
significance.
mr.
justice
brandeis
in
his
dissenting
opinion
considers
it
some
length
what
the
bounders
had
in
mind
in
connection
with
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
power.
and
mr.
justice
brandeis
said
that,
"that
doctrine
was
not
to
promote
efficiency
he
got.”
oh
no,
it
was
to
prevent
the
exercise
of
arbitrary
power.
and
what
else
did
he
say?
he
said
that
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
was
designed
not
to
avoid
the
friction.
oh
no,
but
by
virtue
of
that
inevitable
friction
to
prevent
the
arbitrary
exercise
of
power.
the
appellees
submit
in
this
court
--
in
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court
as
one
of
the
equities
which
you'll
be
balanced
by
this
court,
which
is
worse
or
the
legislature
of
tennessee
not
to
reapportion,
and
i
am
not
here
depending
the
legislature
of
tennessee
in
that
failure,
that
body
if
not
a
defendant
here.
is
it
worse
for
the
legislature
of
tennessee
not
to
reapportion
or
is
it
worse
for
the
federal
district
courts
to
violate
the
agile
doctrine
of
separation
of
power?
that
is
one
of
the
equity
as
i
submit
which
must
and
should
be
balanced
by
this
honorable
court
in
reaching
a
decision.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
has
been
said
and
by
persons
with
then
the
sound
of
my
voice
that
if
america
is
to
export
democracy,
america
must
be
a
democratic
nation
and
certainly
that
can
be
no
argument
with
that
sort.
the
question
that
follows
if
america
is
to
export
democracy,
what
type
of
democracy
shall
america
shall
export.
will
it
be
constitutional
democracy
consistent
without
form
of
government
or
will
it
be
democracy
by
a
pressure?
democracy,
the
result
of
great
need
as
this
of
course.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
that
is
not
pressure.
the
point
that
i
would
make
if
this
court
or
the
district
court
finds
that
the
general
assembly
of
tennessee
or
any
official
of
tennessee
is
violating
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
do
not
simply
state.
do
not
write
it
in
the
find
battalion
hand.
write
it
in
a
bold
hand
and
enforce
that
decree
if
the
federal
district
court
is
empowered
to
do
so.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
say
in
it
--
mr.
jack
wilson
it
does
indeed
your
honor.
it
does
indeed.
that's
the
question
--
one
of
the
great
questions
to
be
determined
by
this
court.
and
so
i
say
may
it
please
the
court
that
if
america
is
to
export
democracy,
we
must
export
constitutional
democracy
and
if
is
for
this
court
to
say.
in
this
case
above
many
other
cases,
what
is
a
constitutional
democracy?
now,
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
chief
justice?
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
and
i
use
this
term
advisably
and
respectfully.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
been
a
great
deal
of
loose
talk
by
the
imposed
and
the
solicitor
general
as
to
whether
the
issue
is
here
presented
a
political
in
nature.
are
they
political
or
what
difference
does
it
make
if
they
are?
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
assist
the
court
in
putting
that
question
in
proper
perspective.
i
might
say
that
i
hope
that
no
judge
ever
seats
on
an
appellate
court
in
the
united
states
of
america.
i
hope
that
no
justice
ever
seats
on
this
high
and
honorable
court
who
does
not
have
a
clear
and
real
understanding
of
the
political
nature
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
of
america.
but
now,
does
that
mean
that
the
court
considered
political
questions
and
all
political
questions?
is
there
a
dividing
line?
let's
look
at
that
a
moment.
what
was
the
growth
of
the
common
law
itself?
it
seems
to
me
if
i
understand
that
the
political
philosophers
of
greek
that
the
growth
of
the
common
law
in
england
was
political.
politics
of
the
very
highest
tide
did
not
the
courts
of
england
developed
the
law
merchant
from
the
customs
in
the
commercial
world?
indeed,
they
did,
legal
history
shows
and
what
was
that?
that
was
the
action,
the
relation,
the
interaction
of
people
in
a
society,
oh
yes,
political.
now,
what
else
do
we
find
in
the
common
law?
well,
negligence
for
instance,
should
a
husband's
negligence
be
imputed
to
his
wife?
oh,
what
--
is
that
statutory?
isn't
that
common
law?
the
interaction,
the
relations
within
a
family,
political,
yes,
must
there
be
consideration
for
a
contract?
all
of
those
things
grew
up
in
the
common
law.
they
were
political.
they
were
political
in
some
sort.
and
then
we
come
to
the
land
of
cases
upon
which
the
appellants
rely
in
this
case.
nixon
against
herndon,
terry
against
adams,
and
those
cases
have
been
waived
like
banners
in
the
briefs
and
before
this
court.
political
right,
yes,
the
right
to
vote,
personal
political
right.
and
this
court
has
held
time
and
time
again
that
that
is
a
right
which
can
be
enforced.
now,
where
does
this
court
draw
the
line?
where
does
the
federal
judiciary
draw
the
line?
is
it
not
at
the
point
where
a
matter
is
to
be
performed
by
another
branch
of
the
government?
is
not
that
one
of
the
dividing
line?
is
it
not?
the
president
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
under
a
constitutional
duty
to
see
that
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
being
faithfully
executed.
are
the
income
tax
laws
in
the
state
of
new
mexico
being
enforced?
i
don't
know.
would
this
court
inquire
into
it?
i
suggest
not
and
yet,
that
is
a
constitutional
duty
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government.
now,
this
court
in
the
pacific
telephone
case
cited
in
the
briefs
held
that
in
the
case
of
this
time,
the
dividing
line
was
simply
this.
is
the
attack
made
on
the
law?
for
instance
here
is
an
attack
made
on
any
tax
in
tennessee
and
they're
not.
the
attack
is
made
on
the
legislature
which
enacts
the
laws,
which
provide
for
the
collection
and
distribution
of
those
taxes.
now,
we
suggest,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
we
referred
to
coleman
against
miller
just
a
little
bit
a
go,
that
is
a
great
case
and
that
case,
mr.
justice
black
wrote
a
separate
opinion
not
on
the
subject
covered
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
but
on
the
question
of,
"what
is
a
political
question?
what
is
a
political
question?”
and
in
that
opinion,
mr.
justice
black
said
in
substance
this,
"a
political
question
is
a
question
which
must
be
left
to
the
political
department
who
has
the
duty
with
which
the
subject
matter
is
concerned."
and
in
making
that
statement,
he
cited
two
cases
which
the
appellees
have
cited
in
their
briefs.one
is
the
pacific
states
telephone
case
and
the
other
is
luther
against
borden,
both
involving
the
question
of
what
is
a
republican
reform
of
government?
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
there
is
a
question
here
as
to
what
the
analyst
of
these
appellees
is
or
--
the
appellants,
what
use
do
they
have
here?
is
it
a
legal
interest?
what
if
the
case
involves
individual
voting,
i
suggest
that
the
appellants
do
have
a
personal
view.
if
this
case
involves
the
reapportionment
of
the
tennessee
legislative,
i
suggest
that
the
rights
which
these
appellants
claimed
are
the
same
as
the
citizens
or
all
other
citizens
in
tennessee.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
a
question
not
previously
mentioned
i
believe.
in
the
united
states,
we
have
room,
tolerance
for
all
religious
view,
racial
views,
opinions
of
all
types.
suppose
a
citizen
in
tennessee
went
into
the
federal
district
courts
to
complain
of
over
representation,
over
representation,
might
he
not
do
so?
if
the
courts
can
hear
cases
on
under
representation
might
they
not
hear
cases
on
over
representation?
we
submit
and
most
respectfully
that
this
is
a
case,
a
gets
the
state
of
case.
it
is
a
case
with
which
all
the
citizens
and
voters
of
tennessee
are
concerned.
we
suggest
that
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
that
these
appellants
cannot
maintain
action
of
this
type,
political,
yes,
but
on
the
other
side,
they
lack.
mr.
jack
wilson
well
that,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
the
clear
implication
which
is
refuted
by
the
vote
on
the
1959
legislative
act
for
instance
where
the
state
senate
unanimously
voted
in
favor
of
the
measure
regardless
of
how
important,
and
i
wish
to
speak
about
that
a
little
later
if
the
court
would
permit
me.
now,
it
may
please
to
court,
of
course
one
of
the
crucial
questions
in
this
case,
one
of
the
decisive
issues
is
whether
there
is
any
federal
rights
here
involved.
stated
simply
and
i
believe
fairly,
the
issue
is
presented
by
the
appellant
in
this
fashion.
it's
a
personal
individual
right.
it
involves
the
right
to
vote.
it
is
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
i
suppose
it
is
the
man
individual
right.
suppose
it
doesn't
concern
the
right
to
vote
but
concerns
legislative
representation,
is
it
protected
with
the
fourteenth
amendment,
is
it?
how
has
this
matter
then
presented
to
this
court
in
this
case
and
in
the
other
cases
as
a
fourteenth
amendment
case?
why
just
this?
and
it's
so
simple
that
it's
almost
alarming
if
--
if
i
understand
it.
it
said
that
where
you
vote
for
congressman
or
united
states
senate
that
that
ballot
must
be
put
into
ballot
box
and
that
that
ballot
must
be
counted,
and
reliances
had
upon
two
cases,
united
states
against
classic,
united
states
against
saylor,
both
sound
dependent.
what
were
those
cases?
indictments
in
criminal
cases
and
what
was
the
advancement,
may
it
please
the
court?
well
in
the
vernacular,
it
was
stopping
the
ballot
box,
stopping
the
ballot
box,
sound
cases
of
course.
now,
it
said
because
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
those
cases,
that
it
follows
that
a
citizen
in
one
of
the
50
states
or
in
all
of
the
50
states
of
the
united
states
held
the
right
to
have
equal
representation
in
a
state
legislature.
what
about
the
expert
field
of
lawyer?
does
it
follow?
is
there
really
any
causal
connection?
i
suggest
not.
that
is
still
just
a
little
bit
farther
and
looked
at
those
cases.
and
i
emphasized
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
appellees
think
those
cases
are
sound
in
their
content.
well,
if
there
was
an
indictment
somebody
was
arrested?
who'd
they
arrest
in
those
cases?
legislator,
legislator.
now,
they
--
if
those
--
the
rule
in
those
cases
applies
here,
someone
in
the
state
of
tennessee
is
subject
to
be
indicted
by
federal
district
court,
who
is
it
--
who
is
it?
well
not
the
election
official
that
the
ballot
box
alleged,
just
(inaudible).
is
it
any
of
the
appellees
before
this
court?
indeed,
not.
no
wrongdoing
but
who
would
you
indict?
would
it
be
the
members
of
the
legislature
of
tennessee?
i
leave
it
with
this
honorable
court,
i
suggest
in
most
respectfully
that
those
cases
sound
as
they
are
do
not
support
legislature.
indeed
not.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
may
i
speak
as
to
this
proposition
of
discrimination
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
find.
and
i
do
not
see
how
it
possibly
can
but
in
the
event
that
it
finds
that
this
is
a
matter,
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
court
must
find,
i
take
it,
under
the
insistence
of
the
appellants
that
there
has
been
discrimination.
i
don't
know
--
i
--
i
--
seriously,
truthfully,
i
do
not
understand
how
they
can
say
that
this
discrimination,
it
would
exist,
is
purposeful
and
systematic.
they
don't
say
any
such
thing.
they
say
it's
due
to
the
passage
of
time.
it's
due
to
shifts
in
population.
and
may
it
please
the
court
in
tennessee,
we
not
only
have
the
passage
of
time,
we
do
indeed
have
shifts
in
population.
within
the
past
25
years,
there
has
been
constructed
a
multiple
system
of
dams
by
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
a
great
nuclear
installation
at
oak
bridge
which
20
years,
the
goals
is
--
the
top
of
--
of
a
ridge
out
in
the
mountains
and
hills.
surely,
that
is
purposeful
and
systematic
discrimination.
now,
this
court
said
in
snowden
against
huge
where
such
terms
were
used
willful
and
malicious
discriminations.
and
this
court
said
that
doesn't
add
anything
to
it.
that
doesn't
add
anything
to
it.
you
still
must
look
to
see
what
brought
it
about.
and
so
we
suggest,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
there
is
not
and
there
cannot
be
any
purposeful
and
systematic
discrimination.
now,
what
about
the
injury
alleged
in
this
case?
and
i
take
it
that
the
courts
generally
are
not
concern
with
discrimination
unless
there
is
some
major.
what
is
the
anxious
here?
it's
a
void
that
there
is
an
inequitable
distribution
of
textbooks
in
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
i
want
to
take
just
a
very
few
minutes
and
explain
to
the
court
if
i
may
what
has
happened
in
the
state
of
tennessee
that
brings
this
complaint
about.
tennessee's
count
is
range
in
size
from
some
half
million
or
more
to
3000,
3500
people
out.
gasoline
tax
funds,
sales
tax
funds
must
be
used
with
state
purposes
and
of
course
distributed
in
part
among
the
counties
of
the
state.
now,
whenever
this
subject
is
brought
up
in
tennessee
and
my
friend's
adversaries
here
will
bear
me
out
on
view.
whenever
this
subject
is
brought
up
in
tennessee,
what
is
said?
shelby
county,
half
million
people
them
all
paid
so
much
into
the
state
treasurer.
what's
on
the
(inaudible)?
van
buren
county,
tennessee
about
3000
people
and
i
may
say
it
to
the
--
to
the
members
of
this
court
that
van
buren
county
lies
almost
out
of
the
middle
tennessee,
almost
into
east
tennessee.
the
beauty
of
it
is
almost
unbelievable,
the
valleys,
the
hills,
the
mountains,
it's
a
mountainous
camp.
and
there's
the
trouble
with
van
buren
county,
how
do
you
make
a
living
on
the
side
of
the
mountain?
well,
you
must
make
a
living
before
you
can
pay
taxes.
those
citizens
in
van
buren
county
are
energetic.
they
are
progressive,
they
have
small
industries,
they
have
small
funds
but
i
was
distressed
to
line
just
before
coming
here
to
argue
this
case.
van
buren
county
has
been
classified
by
the
federal
government
as
a
depressed
area,
a
depressed
area.
i
regretted
to
hear
that.
now,
how
do
you
pay
taxes
to
maintain
school
in
van
buren
county?
well,
you
do
the
best
you
can,
and
then
you
get
what
money
you
can
from
the
state
of
tennessee.
and
remember,
it
is
a
sovereign
state.
it
is
just
a
group
of
municipalities.
it's
one
of
the
sovereign
states.
now,
the
complaint
is
made
and
that's
what
the
proof
would
be
in
this
case,
if
it's
in
van
buren.
you
are
sending
too
much
money
to
van
buren
county.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
is
the
legislature
of
tennessee?
what
is
the
department
of
education
of
tennessee
trying
to
do
in
van
buren
county?
is
it
trying
to
give
those
mountain
boys
and
girls
an
education
so
that
they
may
come
here
to
this
great
national
gallery
and
with
painting
about
renoir
or
van
gogh?
is
it
that
they
may
have
that
foolish
appreciation
of
beethoven's
greatness
owned
as
desirable
as
that
might
be?
is
it
that
they
--
they
may
be
equipped
to
make
a
living?
well
in
van,
yes.
but,
may
it
please
the
court,
what
the
state
of
tennessee
would
like
to
do
for
these
children,
is
to
give
them
education
and
make
them
aware
about
democratic
society.
make
them
aware
of
the
type
of
life
we
live
in
the
united
states
of
america.
oh,
the
municipalities
say,
“we
cannot
do
it.
we
entitle
the
more
money.”
is
this
the
urban
view
point?
the
municipalities
want
in
the
legislatures
of
the
united
states
of
america,
god
forbid.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
how
is
--
why
is
it
that
at
the
varied
time,
the
united
states
of
america
is
concerning
itself
with
parody,
not
only
materially
things.
we
say
as
i
understand
it,
we
want
other
people,
other
cultures
and
other
lands
to
know
about
our
democracy,
to
know
about
our
way
of
life.
well,
i've
delivered
children
in
van
buren
county
entitled
to
it
too,
and
tennessee
is
fine
to
give
too.
what
does
this
court
say
and
i
believe
one
member
of
the
court
mentioned
the
adjournment
of
congress
a
few
days
ago.
they
do
agree
on
certain
legislation.
do
you
know,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
mighty
mayors
of
this
mighty
cities
of
tennessee,
while
the
federal
aid
the
education
bail
was
pending,
that
they
was
standing
almost
in
a
trance
without
stretched
hands.
let
us
help
some
of
the
education
money.
and
where
is
it
coming
from?
tennessee?
oh,
must
--
it
must
be
some
other
state.
tennessee
doesn't
have
that
type.
how
can
they
say
as
an
injury
in
this
case
that
the
children
of
van
buren
county
are
not
entitled
to
an
education
while
they
themselves
are
seeking
these
enormous
bonds
from
the
federal
government?
may
it
please
the
court,
i
suggest
to
this
honorable
court,
that
the
question
here
presented
is
the
broad
question
of
the
lack
of
republican
form
government.
i
also
suggest,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
it
is
not
primarily
a
legal
method.
i
suggest
that
it
is
one
of
the
ills
of
our
democracy.
what
has
this
court
said?
in
the
great
case
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
against
sawyer,
decided
lefts
in
a
decade
ago.
in
that
case,
whether
then
the
pressman
sought
to
take
over
the
steel
industries.
mr.
justice
douglas
said
this
in
substance,
“we
pay
a
price
for
our
system
of
government
and
indeed
we
do.
it
is
a
price
that
today,”
meaning
on
that
day,
“may
seem
exorbitant
to
me.
i
indeed,
we
do
fail
the
price.”
the
failure
to
reapportion
one
of
them,
it
may
be,
it
may
be.
in
the
same
case,
youngstown
tube
and
steel
case,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
this
in
subject,
“a
constitutional
democracy
like
ours
is
perhaps
the
most
difficult
of
man's
social
arrangements
to
manage
success.”
is
it
not
true,
and
yet
we
fight
the
wars.
we
give
life
in
order
to
maintain
it.
what
did
this
court
say
in
colegrove
against
green
and
that
case
too
has
been
batted
around
and
waived
in
the
briefs
and
here
before
this
court.
in
the
majority
of
opinion
in
that
case,
there
appears
this
thing.
throughout
our
history,
the
most
glaring
disparities
have
prevailed
as
to
the
contours
and
the
population
of
business.
there
were
some
three
or
four
or
five
other
opinions
in
that
case,
but
i
have
fixed
those
opinions
up
and
down
and
back
and
forth,
no
member
of
the
court
then
sitting
took
issue
with
that
as
such,
and
i
suggest
that
no
issue
can
be
taken
with
them,
it
has
ever
been
one
of
the
evil
of
our
democracy.
now,
in
the
youngstown
sheet
&
tube
case,
one
of
the
great
cases
decided
by
this
court,
it
is
also
said
not
just
suggested,
it
is
said
that
the
founders,
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
make
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
the
over
sale
of
the
entire
federal
establishment.
i
would
like
to
amend
that
if
i
may
by
saying
that
there
is
no
evidence
or
indication
either
that
the
framers
intended
to
make
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
the
overseer
of
the
several
states
of
the
unions
and
that
several
establishment.
now,
if
this
is
one
of
the
ills
about
moneys
and
the
court
must
decide
their
case
from
here.
what
is
to
be
done
about
it?
how
are
reforms
and
a
democracy
brought
about?
well,
first
i
suggest,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
wrongs
must
be
real
and
not
theoretical.
they
must
be
real
enough
that
they
are
actually
hurting
somebody,
his
pocketbook,
his
mentality,
his
disposition?
that's
when
the
american
people
become
aroused.
what
does
history
show?
is
it
true
that
the
only
thing
that
history
teaches
is
that
history
teaches
nothing?
what
about
the
rights
in
magna
carta?
they
want
theoretical
work,
oh
no.
well
what
about
these
rights
in
this
--
in
the
indictment
here,
the
decoration
of
independence?
they
weren't
theoretical,
oh,
no.
the
rights
determined
by
the
immense
patience
proclamation
were
not
theoretical.
when
rights
become
concrete,
when
citizens
are
concerned
with
those
rights,
they
will
enforce
it.
now,
how
do
you
enforce
democratic
rights,
political
rights
in
a
democracy?
well,
traditionally
it's
done
it
ballot
box.
the
people
must
be
educated.
they
must
be
interested.
they
must
want
to
do
something
about
it.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
said
in
this
case,
it
said
in
this
case,
that
the
appellants
have
no
way
of
getting
any
help
of
any
kinds,
any
way.
i
don't
believe
the
members
of
this
honorable
court
will
accept
that
statement.
isn't
it
strange
that
that
has
never
to
this
date,
then
a
campaign
for
the
office
of
governor
in
the
state
of
tennessee
where
real
apportionment
was
an
issue?
where
do
people
present
that
issue?
they
present
their
issues
through
persons
who
are
candidates
for
statewide
offices.
no
candidate
for
any
statewide
office
particularly
the
governor
of
tennessee
has
ever
made
that,
a
plank
in
his
place.
it
may
happen.
and
when
it
does,
the
legislature
of
tennessee
may
take
action.
i
don't
know.
is
it
not
necessary
in
a
democracy
of
outside
that
this
political
views,
they
hand
for
the
political
process?
and
i
want
to
recall
briefly
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
as
to
an
instance
that
occurred
in
1953,
tennessee's
constitution
had
not
been
amended
for
80
years.
the
citizen
said
we
think
that
it
should
be
amended.
the
legislature
authorize
that
the
question
be
submitted
to
the
people
as
to
the
vote,
whether
they
wanted
a
constitution
event,
and
then
what
happened?
that
question
was
talked
up
and
down,
the
life
and
breathe
of
the
state.
it
was
discussed
on
the
radio,
through
the
newspaper
by
editorial
and
in
my
home
city
of
chattanooga.
i
know
and
this
is
a
matter
of
rapid,
may
it
please
the
court,
groups
were
formed,
representatives
of
labors
thereon,
representatives
of
industry,
representatives
of
a
negro.
tennessee
voted
for
that
constitutional
convention
and
it
was
held.
and
one
of
the
amazing
things
is
the
way
and
mainly
in
which
that
convention
was
held.
what
did
tennessee
do?
well,
i'd
say
this
first,
that
in
choosing
its
delegates
to
that
constitutional
convention,
that
first
in
80
years,
it
didn't
go
to
the
(inaudible)
around
the
city
hall.
who
composed
that
convention?
former
governors,
former
congressmen,
school
teachers,
college
professors,
farmers,
businessmen,
some
of
them
i
suggest,
the
majority
of
them
had
never
offered
themselves
at
the
ballot
box
in
any
type
of
allege.
most
of
them
never
will
again.
they
sought
to
serve
thus
thing.
now,
that
constitutional
convention
did
adopt
some
amendments.
for
instance,
it
increased
the
term
of
our
governor
from
two
years
to
four
years.
it
made
some
changes
as
to
the
way
in
manner
in
which
the
constitution
itself
may
be
amended.
and
this
is
an
interesting
thing
and
something
that
i
think
this
court
should
know.
that
constitutional
convention
was
not
concerned
alone
with
government
at
the
state.
it
was
dissatisfied
with
government
at
the
local
level.
listen
to
this.
they
said,
"we
think
there
should
be
some
means
of
consolidating
city
and
county
from
it,
whether
it'd
be
education
or
whether
it'd
be
in
all
services.
now,
what
has
happened
under
that?
and
i
think
this
is
material
to
this
case.
what
has
happened
under
that
constitutional
amendment?
this
past
legislature
enacted
a
law,
committing
the
people
of
the
city
of
knoxville
and
davidson
county
to
set
up
a
charter
commission,
to
write
a
charter,
to
submit
to
the
people
of
the
county
and
the
city
as
to
whether
the
county
and
city
government
should
be
consolidated.
and
as
i
understand
it
mr.
chief
justice,
the
result
would
be
something
like
the
government
of
the
great
city
of
saint
louis
or
the
great
city
county
of
denver.
and
if
i
am
not
misinformed,
that
charter
commission
will
meet
tonight
for
another
meeting
in
the
city
of
knoxville
(inaudible).
well,
they
have
a
label
represented
them
on
and
he
has
that
type
too,
that's
the
way
he
spoke.
they
have
an
industry
representative.
they
have
a
negro
lawyer
on
that
commission,
all
elements
of
the
committee.
i
am
not
here
advocating
metropolitan
government.
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
good
or
bad.
but
what
i
want
to
say
to
this
honorable
court
is
that
the
channels
of
democracy
are
opened
in
tennessee.
let
there
be
no
dispute
about
that.
and
incidentally,
may
it
please
the
court,
tennessee
held
another
constitutional
convention
in
1950.
nobody
has
told
us
to
go
there.
we
came
all
along
more
often
than
every
six
years.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
let
it
not
be
said
at
the
bottom
of
this
high
court
that
if
the
people
of
tennessee
are
interested
in
our
reform
of
any
type,
that
the
challenge
of
democracy
are
closed
too.
it
is
not
true.
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
one
of
the
things
that
--
mr.
jack
wilson
that's
what
it
is
but
here,
may
it
please
the
court,
but
all
humans
are
subject
to
certain
lifespan.
we
all
subject
to
this
world's
illness
and
loss,
perhaps
that
situation
may
appear
to
be
true
in
tennessee
today,
but
i
suggest
that
the
matter
has
not
yet
been
brought
out
in
the
political
region.
may
i
say
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
the
level
on
which
it
is
now
being
bought
out
in
tennessee,
of
course
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee
is
having
one
lawsuit
houses.
how
is
it
being
bought
in
the
political
region?
the
honorable
mayor
of
the
city
of
nashville
comes
out
in
the
newspapers
of
tennessee
and
makes
the
statement.
behold,
send
more
county
tennessee,
held
more
representation
in
the
legislature
of
tennessee
that
a
citizen
of
davidson
county.
well,
i
don't
know
but
that's
good
campaigning
or
not
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
--
mr.
jack
wilson
halves
may
it
please
the
court.
and
more
county
has
another
one
of
household
counties
of
some
3000
population.
perhaps
that
type
of
campaigning
in
tennessee
would
appeal
to
some
voters,
it
so
far
has
not
appealed
to
the
majority.
why
not
tell
that
people
of
tennessee
about
these
great
constitutional
principles
we
are
discussing
here
today?
why
not
provide
them
with
cartoons
of
a
type
that
have
been
published
in
some
of
the
briefs
submitted
to
this
court
surprisingly?
cartoons
have
their
effect.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
would
say,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
on
the
present
status
of
the
case
law
in
tennessee
and
of
the
views
held
as
in
to
the
constitutional
law
in
tennessee
that
this
right,
alleged
right
is
not
enforceable
in
any
of
the
courts
of
tennessee,
to
any
degree,
whatsoever.
and
i
would
be
less
and
truthful
to
you
your
honor
if
i
did
not
choose
it.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
it
has
not
squalled,
it
has
not.
this
court,
the
members
of
this
court
are
familiar
with
the
case
of
kidd
against
mccanless.
but
the
decisions
of
the
court
of
tenne
--
courts
of
tennessee
and
other
less
serious
matters
involving
the
separation
of
powers,
and
many
of
those
decisions
are
set
out
in
the
appellees'
supplemental
brief,
clearly
indicate
at
least
to
me
as
a
practitioner
in
tennessee
that
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
would
not
entertain
such
an
action.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
think
kidd
against
mccanless,
may
it
please
the
court,
was
fairly
presented.
i
think
it
was
squarely
presented.
and
the
meaning
and
the
extent
of
that
decision
is
of
course
for
this
court
but
we
think
that
that
court
said,
that
while
it
placed
its
decision
on
the
de
facto,
if
it
had
not
done
so,
it
would
have
placed
it
on
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers.
i
think
it
would
have
on
the
out
concept
of
constitutional
government
in
tennessee.
mr.
jack
wilson
in
this
case?
mr.
jack
wilson
i
think
so,
may
it
please
the
court,
from
the
standpoint
of
practice,
i
think
it
was
properly
raised.
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
you're
speaking
of
the
district
court
then?
mr.
jack
wilson
kidd
against
mccanless?
mr.
jack
wilson
our
district
--
our
supreme
court
did
this,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
said
that
the
insistence
in
kidd
against
mccanless
was
that
the
act
of
1901
the
last
apportionment
act
was
unconstitutional.
our
supreme
court
said
that
if
we
hold
that
the
act
of
1901
is
unconstitutional,
we,
therefore,
deprive
the
state
of
tennessee
of
the
present
legislature
and
we
deprive
the
people
of
tennessee
of
all
proud
legislatures.
because
if
the
1901
act
was
unconstitutional,
prior
acts
were
unconstitutional
and
there
would
be
no
law
such
as
in
the
tuskegee
case
to
fall
back.
and
our
supreme
court
said
the
result
is
and
must
be
that
the
state
of
tennessee
would
be
without
one
of
its
coordinate
righteous
of
government.
that's
what
that
case
holds
to
mean,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
not
sir,
i
would
not.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
would
not.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
would
never
reach
the
question
of
whether
it
was
rational,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
say
that
the
apportionment
and
distribution
of
legislative
representatives
within
a
state
is
a
state
map.
mr.
jack
wilson
(inaudible)
mr.
jack
wilson
yes.
mr.
jack
wilson
it
might
not,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
might
not
but
i
--
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
held
--
mr.
jack
wilson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
certain
there
is
then
in
our
democracy,
may
it
please
the
court,
on
any
substance.
certainly
would
not
deny
to
these
appellants
or
anyone
else
their
right
to
present
their
views.
i
only
asked
that
we
may
be
allowed
to
present
ours
on
one.
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court?
maybe
i'm
too
precedence
but
i
--
i
do
not
see
that
--
that
the
court
reaches
that
point
without
exposing
of
a
number
of
others.
for
instance,
the
question
of
standards
which
has
not
been
--
mr.
jack
wilson
standards,
may
it
please
the
court,
standards,
discrimination,
contemplates
on
departure
--
mr.
jack
wilson
--
from
some
point.
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
say
that
i
wouldn't
like
it
and
that
tomorrow,
it
might
be
wrong.
i
would
say
that
is
not
a
legal
of
constitutional
question
there.
if
there
is,
how
is
it
that
the
great
case,
say,
state
of
pennsylvania,
its
commonwealth.
the
great
commonwealth
essential
bank
provides
special
representation
for
each
cities
and
the
complaint
there
as
i
understand
it
is
not
that
but
that
these
cities
want
more
than
they
have
now.
now,
how
much
more?
is
it
seven
or
eight
as
your
honor
suggest?
is
it
ten
to
one?
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
if
the
court
had
proceeded
to
the
point
that
it
had
reached
the
point
of
which
your
honor
speakers,
i
don't
believe
any
statement
on
the
subject
would
be
of
much
assistance
to
the
court.
i'm
assuming
as
your
honor
did,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
wilson
yes.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
suggest
that
it
would
not,
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
i
do
not
think
that
i
could
answer
that.
otherwise,
tennessee
has
some
three
and
a
half
million
people.
i
do
not
know
the
population
of
the
great
state
of
delaware.
i
had
been
there
and
i
do
know
that
the
side
was
so
small
that
if
i
remember
correctly,
all
of
their
telephone
numbers
for
the
entire
state
in
less
than
one
total.
well,
now
they
have
two
united
states
senators.
tennessee,
three
and
a
half
million
people,
500
violence
from
one
corner
across
it
to
another,
i
wouldn't
be
satisfied.
i'm
not
satisfied
now
that
delaware
or
have
many
united
states
senators
in
states.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes.
mr.
jack
wilson
my
answer,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
it
would
not
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
think
that's
--
mr.
jack
wilson
i
think
it's
true,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
bring
it
if,
i
may
your
honor,
bring
it
back
to
the
--
again,
this
question
of
the
trial
lawyer
and
the
--
and
the
expert
field
lawyer.
now,
it
has
been
said
by
one
of
the
members
of
this
court
a
statement
most
interesting
to
me
and
that
it
is
very
pertinent
on
the
subjects
and
questions
just
asked.
it
has
been
said
that
it's
possible
to
distinguish
between
double
and
portrait
without
being
able
to
define
what
portrait
is.
now
i
suggest,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
may
be
able
possible
to
distinguish.
but
i
suggest
it
would
not
be
possible
to
tell
someone
else
how
to
distinguish
between
--
mr.
jack
wilson
yes
your
honor,
about
3000
people.
mr.
jack
wilson
very
small.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes.
mr.
jack
wilson
--
yes.
mr.
jack
wilson
it
maybe.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
we
have
interposed
a
plea
of
sovereign
immunity
here
and
these
--
mr.
jack
wilson
this
--
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
even
so
the
appellees
here
are
not
authorized
to
speak
for
the
state
of
tennessee
or
to
explain
or
to
justify
why
the
legislature
has
not
done
this
and
if
i
could
answer
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
both.
maybe
it
couldn't
be.
i
don't
know
but
someone
would
have
to
come
here
and
speak
for
the
legislature.
they
are
not
--
mr.
jack
wilson
gibson
county
is
--
is
substantial
county,
city,
town.
it's
generally
in
the
rural
area
but
--
mr.
jack
wilson
what,
blount
--
mr.
jack
wilson
county?
mr.
jack
wilson
that's
adjacent
to
one
of
the
four
largest
counties.
mr.
jack
wilson
suburban.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes.
gibson
is
over
represented.
mr.
jack
wilson
in
what
--
mr.
jack
wilson
it
is
not
in
tennessee,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
not
so
in
tennessee.
i
cannot
speak
for
the
other
states
that
people
of
tennessee
are
independent
in
nature.
they
do
a
great
deal
of
their
own
thinking
and
what
might
be
the
vote
in
shelby
or
the
mississippi
might
not
suit
the
citizenship,
not
the
county
at
all.
so
to
say
that
an
urban
voter
in
tennessee
feels
this
way
or
that
way,
i
think
they
cannot
be
put
in
the
debt
--
mr.
jack
wilson
indeed,
it
is
and
i
wish
i
might
say
it
all
but
--
mr.
jack
wilson
campbell
county
is
in
east
tennessee,
a
few
miles
from
knoxville
county,
one
of
the
full
largest
counties.
mr.
jack
wilson
maybe
it
will
be
your
honor.
maybe
it
will
be.
now,
if
the
court
and
i
--
i
say
this
very
respectfully,
those
questions
are
fortunate.
why
not
put
them
to
the
legislature
of
tennessee?
why
not
sue
the
legislature
of
tennessee
and
let
them
act
but
all
the
all
voice
said,
“no,
no,
you
can't
do
it.”
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
race
for
instance
where
the
white
and
black.
that's
something
due
to
burn.
what
about
your
urban
voter
or
your
rural
voter?
i
don't
know
(voice
overlap).
he
may
be
at
memphis
for
six
months
and
then
he
may
move
to
morgan.
the
state
has
no
control
over
that
matter.
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
the
legislature
does
--
mr.
jack
wilson
well
may
it
please
the
court?
i
am
not
the
one
who
injected
the
question
of
color
into
the
argument.
i
believe
that
was
mentioned
--
mr.
jack
wilson
no,
i
--
i
don't
believe
--
i
don't
believe
that's
been
discussed
and
maybe
you
narrowed
it
that.
mr.
jack
wilson
well
certainly
--
mr.
jack
wilson
--
certainly
he
would,
may
it
please
the
court,
but
not
his
representation
in
the
state
they
claim.
i
think
your
honor's
--
mr.
jack
wilson
--
question
--
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
certainly
it
--
it
could
and
was
right,
of
course.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
wish
--
mr.
jack
wilson
i
would
say,
may
it
please
the
court,
that
the
matter
had
not
gone
beyond
the
theoretical
and
to
thinking
--
the
theoretical
and
to
think
there
was
no
popular
demand
for
it.
there
was
no
popular
demand
that
the
constitutional
convention
consider
reapportion.
had
that
been,
it
would
have
been
included
in
what
we
call
the
call
for
the
convention.
mr.
jack
wilson
indeed,
it
did.
mr.
jack
wilson
no,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
legislature
submitted
to
the
people
under
the
constitution
of
tennessee
whether
the
people
decide
to
hold
a
constitutional
convention.
mr.
jack
wilson
no,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
ways
of
amending
our
constitution.
and
the
constitution
may
be
amended
by
the
legislature
itself
by
action
of
two
successive
legislatures.
then
our
constitution
provides
that
the
legislature
may
submit
to
the
people
of
the
state
at
any
given
general
election.
the
question
of
whether
the
constitution
of
tennessee
shall
be
amended
altered
or
abolish.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
it
made
--
it
is
required
that
it
did
so.
in
other
words,
you
do
not
call
a
constitutional
convention
any
more
than
you
call
an
extra
session
of
the
legislature
in
tennessee
without
defining
its
scope.
mr.
jack
wilson
indeed
so,
indeed
so.
now,
may
it
please
--
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
it
might
be.
yes.
indeed
so,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
your
honor.
debating
justice
--
mr.
jack
wilson
yes.
mr.
jack
wilson
resolution.
mr.
jack
wilson
indeed
so
your
honor,
indeed
so.
and
i
--
it
may
have
been
raised
at
that
time
mr.
justice
brennan.
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
--
mr.
jack
wilson
may
have
done
though,
but
i
do
not
deny
it.
what
i
am
saying
is
there
was
not
sufficient
public
interest
in
our
democratic
system.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes,
that's
--
that's
true,
may
it
please
the
court.
but
you
get
votes
in
the
legislature
when
the
people
demand
it.
mr.
jack
wilson
95,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
perhaps
half
dozen
and
i
would
not
want
to
slice
it.
mr.
jack
wilson
something.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
i
cannot
give
you
those
figures
off
hands
there.
in
the
charts,
i
--
i'm
sorry
that
i
do
not
have
them
in
mind.
i
think
the
short
of
the
matter
is
and
--
and
i
think
there's
no
need
to
quibble
about
it.
the
urban
counties
ought
to
have
more
representation.
i
am
not
here
arguing
that.
oh
no,
i'm
here
arguing
this
lawsuit.
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
only
thing
i
could
say
and
i
say
this
with
the
great
deal
of
respect
would
be
to
invite
your
honor
to
come
to
tennessee
and
observe
tennessee
powers.
mr.
jack
wilson
now,
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
jack
wilson
oh
no
your
honor.
oh
no,
that
--
that
isn't
true.
i
could
name
numerous
--
this
matter
--
mr.
jack
wilson
oh
no,
your
honor.
this
matter
of
legislative
committee
is
no
different
in
tennessee
than
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
we
may
be
a
peculiar
people
as
to
our
legislature
and
reapportionment
but
we
are
not
otherwise
cute.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
i
--
i
would
like
to
do
this.
i
would
like
to
ask
my
associates
--
mr.
jack
wilson
--
if
they
will
make
an
estimate
while
i
cover
two
remaining
points.
mr.
jack
wilson
and
try
to
give
you
those
figures
if
i
may.
mr.
jack
wilson
now
--
one
matter
of
information.
mr.
jack
wilson
they
keep
a
journal,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
(inaudible)
indeed
so.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court,
it
would
show
motions
made,
the
action
on
those
motions.
it
would
show
amendments.
it
would
show
the
members
of
each
house
who
voted
for
and
against,
rather
complete
and
they,
i
am
sure
and
this
court's
liable.
now,
may
it
please
the
court
some
two
or
three
other
subjects
i
wish
to
discuss
within
the
time
remaining.
this
suit
is
the
second
reinforcement
suit
in
tennessee,
although
we
will
have
many
others,
i
do
not
know.
i
personally
had
rather
not
make
it
real
of
reapportionment
litigation.
but
what
is
happening
in
tennessee
as
a
result
of
this
lawsuit?
well,
we
are
hearing
rumors
that
the
municipal
barns
may
not
be
able
to
sell
it,
and
tennessee
has
no
great
financial
status.
many
municipal
bonds
are
sold
locally.
but
the
truth
to
the
matter
is
and
i
hate
--
hate
to
say
it
before
this
honorable
court,
but
if
the
1901
act
in
tennessee
is
unconstitutional,
each
and
every
one
of
these
four
urban
cities
doesn't
exist.
there
have
to
be
no
odds
here
and
they
would
create
by
a
virtue
of
legislative
act.
i
don't
know
if
they
know
that
much
but
that's
so.
mr.
jack
wilson
in
certain
instances,
may
it
please
the
court.
now
may
--
if
i
may
--
mr.
jack
wilson
continue
--
there
is
this
question,
some
two
or
three
years
ago,
we
had
a
criminal
judge
in
tennessee
who
it
was
said
had
forgotten
the
duties
of
his
house
and
the
legislature
of
tennessee.
and
they
said
dominated
with
the
rural
element,
call
that
judge
in.
the
house
of
representatives
impeached.
the
state
senate
tried
to
convict
him.
he's
not
on
a
bench
(inaudible).
not
long
after
that
judge
was
tried
and
convicted,
the
bar
association
of
tennessee
filed
disbarment
proceedings
against.
and
the
chief
ground
of
--
the
disbarment
proceedings'
was
his
impeachment
as
the
trial
judge
in
tennessee.
that
case
has
been
through
the
trial
courts
of
tennessee
through
tennessee
as
intermediate
appellant
court.
it
will
be
heard
before
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee,
a
week
from
today,
and
one
of
the
issues
in
it,
isn't
that
legislature
which
tried
and
convicted
that
criminal
judge
was
illegally
constituted.
the
question
is
being
raised,
not
theoretically.
it's
in
the
court
papers.
what
else
is
happening
in
tennessee?
from
day-to-day,
the
lawyers
on
the
step,
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee
are
confronted
with
habeas
corpus
petition,
averring.
they
had
been
convicted
on
the
unconstitutional
law
because
the
legislature
was
improperly
constituted.
when
i
was
instituted
before
this
court
in
april,
i
raised
the
question
of
what
the
situation
would
be
if
the
district
court
entered
a
decree
declaring
the
government
of
tennessee
operating
unconstitutionally,
whether
that
government
then
so
constituted
could
execute
criminal.
some
of
adversaries
my
appraisers
say,
“oh,
he's
putting
the
ox
in
the
ditch,
so
he
can
take
him
out.”
now
may
it
please
the
court,
i
stand
before
you
today
in
the
month
of
october,
in
the
maximum
security
ability
at
the
state
of
penitentiary
at
national,
as
i
speak
now,
sit
eight
condemned
men,
condemned
to
death,
maybe
the
largest
number
of
tennessee
has
had
in
sometime
if
not
at
any
time.
those
men
have
been
convicted
of
rape,
had
been
convicted
of
murder,
other
capital
crimes.
one
of
those
men
has
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
asserting
that
death
by
electrocution
based
on
law
that
was
inactive
by
a
legislature
improperly
constitute.
i
assume
that
case
will
come
to
this
court
and
i
will
not
discuss
it
further.
but
i
will
say
to
this
court
that
the
governor
of
tennessee,
our
chief
executive,
has
announced
and
has
acted,
he
has
suspended
the
executions
in
all
criminal
cases
including
these
eight
men,
until
it
is
determined
whether
tennessee
may
lawfully
execute
criminals
by
the
electric
chair.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
i
don't
think
the
court
can
and
--
and
i
think
the
matter
may
be
determined
and
rapidly
and
should
be
that
this
district
court
will
not
interfere
with
the
government
of
tennessee.
now,
what
else
is
happening
in
tennessee
may
it
please
the
court
that
is
on
the
certiorari
docket
of
this
court
is
not
disposed
off
today.
codes
number
342
(inaudible)
against
state
of
tennessee,
i
will
not
of
course
discuss
that
case.
but
counsel
for
the
state
of
tennessee
in
that
case,
senate
counsel
table
and
one
of
the
questions
varied
to
is
that
legislature
of
tennessee
illegally
constituted
and
acted
--
enacted
a
law
under
which
that
taken
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted.
now,
i
will
not
repeat
at
this
time
a
discussion
given
in
april
as
to
the
possible
effect
upon
the
operations
in
the
government
of
tennessee
in
the
event
this
honorable
court
authorizes
the
district
court
to
enter
a
decree
of
unconstitutionality.
but
i
do
want
to
discuss
and
most
briefly
the
question
of,
"what
would
be
the
general
effect
of
an
adverse
ruling
in
this
case?"
mr.
jack
wilson
no,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
this
court
follows
the
case
of
luther
against
borden
and
there
is
--
mr.
jack
wilson
upon
the
declaration
being
made
--
mr.
jack
wilson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
no,
i
do
not
so
interpret
it
your
honor.
the
court
--
mr.
jack
wilson
i
think
it
is,
may
it
please
the
court,
because
they
say
and
very
specifically
that
if
it
is
held
that
this
act
is
unconstitutional
then
this
legislature
doesn't
exist
and
prior
legislatures,
i
think
it
could
not
have
insisted.
mr.
jack
wilson
well
now,
what
--
what
might
be
the
general
effect
of
an
adverse
decision
in
this
case?
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
some
40
states
concerned
with
this
problem.
there
are
some
20
states
who
--
which
are
in
a
riffs,
their
reapportion.
is
this
court
to
authorize
the
several
district
courts
of
united
states
to
get
busy
straighten
up
the
state
governments
--
submit
to
state
governments,
would
not
that
result
follow?
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
whether
a
legislature
had
failed
to
apportionment.
oh
no,
if
i
understand
the
new
york
case
in
which
a
three-judge
district
court
had
been
convened,
it
is
not
a
followed,
it
is
not
insistent
that
the
legislature
of
new
york
has
failed
to
apportionment,
oh
no.
it
is
insisted
that
under
a
valid
apportionment,
constitutionally
valid
in
accordance
with
their
constitution,
there
is
inadequate
representation
of
certain
aliens.
must
that
not
follow?
must
that
not
follow
if
this
court
is
to
enter
the
field?
and
as
was
suggested
a
little
while
ago,
does
it
really
make
any
difference
what
the
constitution
provides?
doesn't
it
really?
would
not
this
ruling,
may
it
please
the
court,
would
not
this
ruling
applied
to
all
city
counsel
all
over
the
united
states
would
not
interplay
to
the
districts
and
the
counties
and
parishes'
all
over
the
united
states
equality
of
representation?
and
i
regret
to
have
--
to
have
to
tell
this
court
that
in
the
city
of
nashville,
whose
male
is
(inaudible)
all
in
this
case.
citizens
are
plummeting
for
more
equal
representation
on
the
city
counsel.
and
what
does
the
honorable
mayor
said?
“we
are
worth
it.
we
are
worth
it.”
now
answering
your
question
if
i
may,
my
associates
advised
me
that
in
their
opinion
and
some
half
of
the
voters
of
the
state
would
be
considered
urban
voters
under
their
calculations
and
of
course
that
can
be
no
more
than
--
than
rough
calculations.
mr.
jack
wilson
roughly
had,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
jack
wilson
counties,
may
it
please
the
court,
counties.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
now,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
my
time
is
quite
limited.
if
the
members
or
any
member
of
this
court
desires
a
memorandum
on
that
subject
or
any
other,
we
will
make
every
effort
to
furnish
it.
but
i
--
i
cannot
give
a
more
definite
answer
to
your
honor
at
this
time.
mr.
jack
wilson
may
it
please
the
court
mr.
mccanless,
the
attorney
general
of
tennessee,
tells
me
that
his
estimate
is
that
the
rural
vote
in
the
general
assembly
of
tennessee
is
approximately
two
thirds.
and
i
apologize
to
you
your
honor
if
we
did
not
understand
the
question.
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
that's
the
best
answer
i
could
give
that
they
have
to
--
mr.
jack
wilson
well,
may
it
please
the
court,
it
was
our
intention
to
answer
that
as
i
did
and
we
--
we
believe
that
it
is
approximately
two
thirds
to
one
urban
county.
members
--
members,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
wilson
approximately,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
that's
roughly
half
and
half,
perhaps
predominantly
urban.
mr.
jack
wilson
and
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
get
you.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
closing.
it
seems
i
believe
that
the
court
must
and
should
balance
the
default
of
the
legislature
of
tennessee
as
to
each
constitution
with
the
question
of
whether
this
court,
in
view
of
the
plea
of
sovereign
immunity,
in
view
of
the
question
of
its
being
a
state
legislature
will
for
the
first
time
step
over
into
the
state
figure.
and
we
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
serious
and
one
of
the
important
questions
to
be
determined
by
the
court.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
most
important
to
tennessee,
most
important
to
the
states
of
the
united
states
and
we
feel
that
if
a
large
major,
the
future
of
the
government
of
the
state
of
tennessee
rests
in
the
hands
of
this
court,
and
indeed
we
feel
that
in
an
enlargement
future
of
constitutional
government
in
the
united
states
of
america
rests
with
this
court.
mr.
jack
wilson
the
next
general
election
will
be
held
on
august
the
4th
of
next
year.
that
is
the
first
thursday
of
august
4th,
that's
--
of
august.
that
is
the
primary
election
for
the
members
of
the
legislature.
it
is
a
general
election
for
the
election
of
such
judges
as
ought
to
be
elected.
mr.
jack
wilson
then
--
then
the
general
election
for
the
members
of
the
legislature
would
be
the
following
november
of
next
year.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
no
your
honor,
it's
during
the
--
in
march
of
this
year.
mr.
jack
wilson
it
will
not,
unless
called
into
special
session
by
the
governor
and
that
is
the
only
mode
in
which
it
maybe
called
and
inspected
session.
mr.
jack
wilson
no
your
honor,
not
on
that
constitution.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes.
mr.
jack
wilson
he
must
do
so.
mr.
jack
wilson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jack
wilson
in
fair
--
not
in
recent
years
but
in
the
history
of
the
state
and
in
the
recent
past
history
of
the
state,
presidents
during
world
war
ii
when
times
prior
to
that,
an
extra
session
was
not
of
use.
