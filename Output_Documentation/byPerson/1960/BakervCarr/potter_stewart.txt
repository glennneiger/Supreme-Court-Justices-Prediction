as

i've

the

divided
into
three

their

the

speaking
generally,
are

in

and
the

mr.

if
this
is
truly

of

of

i
suppose
the
congress

fourteenth

could
do
something
about

couldn't
it?

that
one
of
yours

as

heard

neither

had

justice

yes.
justice

yes.
justice

what
--
justice

stewart
well,
that's
right.
but
there
has

a

i

along

more

you

you
are
suggesting
that

all

that
you
tell

are
true,
then
there
it
should

that
we
should
say

it
should
exercise
equitable

or
--

are

the

justice

as

you

the

would
that
be

so
it
has
met

and
won't

won't
convene
again
unless
there's
a
special
session
until
1963
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
after
the
1962

justice

and
i
suppose
there
are
provisions
for
special
sessions
in
the

justice

stewart
on
the
call
of
the
governor?
justice
potter
stewart
any
other
way
for
a
special
session?
justice

did
the
court
indicate
which
rights
were

did
it
indicate
that
they
were
federal
constitutional
rights

only
the
right

under

justice

mr.

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
rhyne,
just
to
pursue
that
a
moment.
what
if
the
state
constitution
explicitly
provided
the
precise
apportionment
that
now
exists
in
tennessee,
would
you
be
here?
justice

no,
it
were

would
be
carried
out.
the
state
constitution
(voice

my
assumption
would

would
provide

--
if
that
apportionment
had
now
in
fact
exists.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
you
would.
and
therefore,
why
--
how
was
the
state
constitution
have
any
real
importance
at
all?
justice

but
you're
here
under

not

you
might
say
that
there
was
in

stance,
no
denial
of
equal
protection
the
1901
with
8

entitled
to

having
only

might

the
very
function
of
saying
that

yes.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
connection,
mr.
cox,
preliminarily,
am
i
right
in
my
recollection
that
the
defendants
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
based
upon
two
grounds.
want
of
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter
and
secondly,
failure
to
state
its
cause
of
action.
justice

stewart
do
you
think
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
why
--
justice
potter
stewart
while
we're
still
on
this
rather
dull
subject
of
procedure
of
pleading,
mr.
rhyne
emphasized
at
one
point
that
the
state
had
not
sought
to
justify
this
system
and
am
i
not
correct
in
thinking
that
against
the
matter
of
procedure
or
pleading
that
the
--
that
that
point
has
not
yet
arrived?
the
--
the
state
filed
a
motion
and
has
not
yet
answered
on
the
merits,
isn't
that
correct?
by
the
state
--
i
mean
the
defendants
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
event
that
this
court
should
--
should
--
should
decide
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction,
all
those
matters
would
be
matters
of
affirmative
defense
if
you
will
or
--
or
as
it
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
that
--
at
least
in
the
first
instance
also
be
a
matter
for

to
be
canvassed
by
the

you
can
stop

is
it
the
--
or
it
could
be
done
with
respect
to
all
women,
couldn't
it?
justice

stewart
so
far
as
the
fourteenth

lands,
it
required
an
additional
amendment
to
the
constitution
to
give
females
the
road,
did
it
not?
justice

stewart
it
was
raised.
justice

it
was
raised,
it
was
raised.
justice

and
it
was
decided
in
this
court.
justice

that
all
women
could
be
denied
to
vote
under
the
con

under
the
fourteenth

and
not

the
constitution
generally

we
got

amended.

a
rational
line
can
certainly
be
drawn

areas

or
was
--

justice
potter
stewart
again,
do
we
know
that
really?
you
--
we
can
guess
that
you
can
argue
that
but
the
state
has
not
yet,
as
a
matter
of
procedure,
had
any
opportunity
to
factually
justify
this
system,
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
and
make
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
embarrassing
for
the
state
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
we
are
getting
pretty
close
to
the
--
to
the
browning
case.
and
the
fact
is
the
state
couldn't
say,
"well,
this
is
our
system
and
could
justify
it.”
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice

move
it

just
before
you
sit

one
of
the
questions
in

to
be

would
not
be
raised

until
or
unless
certain
other
questions
are
answered
in

a

way.
one
of
those
questions,
one
of
the
possible
questions
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
a
remedy.
and
that
as
mr.
justice
one
of
those
questions,
one
of
the
possible
questions
in
this
case
is
a
question
of
a
remedy
and
that,
as
mr.
justice
rutledge
pointed
out
that
colegrove
against
green
involves
practical
considerations.
it's
with
that
in
mind
that
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
one
or
two
just
practical
factual
questions.
when
is
the
next
general
election
in
tennessee
of
the
legislature?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
we're
not
speaking
about
1962.
justice
potter
stewart
august
1962
would
be
the
primary
election.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
legislature
now
in
session?
justice
potter
stewart
will
it
--
the
ordinary
course
of
events
be
in
session
between
now
and
next
august?
justice
potter
stewart
it
cannot
on
its
own
motion
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
to
be
called
by
the
government.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
can
the
governor
limit
the
agenda
of
a
special
session
by
his
call?
justice
potter
stewart
he
must
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
can
be
done
by
the
governor
at
anytime
and
as
frequently
as
he
liked.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
all
i
want,
thank
you.
