justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhyne,
what's
the
bearing
of
these
provisions
in
the
--
in
the
tennessee
constitution,
the
federal
question
which
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
voted
for
a
statute,
would
it
make
any
difference?
voted
for
statute
in
the
--
instead
of
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
that.
that's
my
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that's
my
question.
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
in
the
constitution
or
in
any
other
expression
or
action
by
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
suppose
they
see
it,
if
it
doesn't
offend
the
federal
constitution,
it
doesn't
make
no
difference
that
offends
the
state
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
denying
that
it
doesn't.
all
i'm
saying
is
you
stressed
the
fact
that
is
incorporated
in
the
state
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
we're
arguing
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
just
--
i
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
imply
mr.
rhyne
that
the
congress
of
the
--
that
according
--
that
as
to
of
federal
voting
rights,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
to
there
what
you
call,
second
class
citizens?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
a
greater
constitutional
protection
for
state
--
in
state
voting
than
federal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
suggesting
that
there
would
be
exclusive
remedies
in
congress.
does
that
mean
that
the
congress
can
establish
second-rate
voters
with
reference
to
national
interest?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
--
i'm
merely
suggesting
the
implication
of
your
--
of
your
distinguishing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
can
understand
your
saying
we
should
--
if
decision
is
wrong,
it
should
be
rejected.
i
can
understand
the
distinction
you
made,
because
it
wouldn't
be
for
that
conclusion.
that
under
the
united
states
constitution,
congress
would
have
power
to
differentiate
in
voting
rights,
but
the
state
voters
have
greater
rights
than
anybody
has
under
the
federal
constitution,
with
reference
to
federal
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said
that,
but
you
also
said
that
i
relied
on
the
--
the
opinion
relied
on
the
exclusiveness
congressional
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
reject
--
and
you
said
that
differentiates
from
yours.
now
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
to
that
argument
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mind
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
objecting
on
good
round,
but
not
on
bad
grounds.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
four
is
more
than
three
that
i
can
understand,
i
wouldn't
confer.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
might
cite
illinois
too,
you
might
cite
illinois,
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
reapportioned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
they've
done
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
they've
done
just
as
well
as
these
other
states?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you've
had
a
case
in
this
court
mr.
solicitor
in
which
it
was
conceded
that
there
was
a
complete
departure
from
the
expressed
and
explicit
and
formally
define
terms
of
the
tennessee
constitution
as
to
taxation,
in
making
a
difference
between
railroad
and
other
properties
for
purpose
of
taxation.
and
this
court
said
that
doesn't
make
any
good.
so
that
the
fact
that
tennessee
has
written
something
into
its
constitution,
doesn't
give
it
less
power
than
if
it
deleted
this
from
the
constitution
and
then
came
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
it
has
in
the
tax
--
in
the
tax
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
stopped
for
a
time,
then
it
became
settled
practice
to
disregard
the
provision
in
the
--
in
the
tennessee
constitution,
that's
the
browning
case,
if
we
have
it
in
10.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
according
to
your
statement,
tennessee
has
a
right
to
be
irrational
for
not
having
anything
in
its
constitution
and
making
differentiation
as
a
matter
of
history,
you
use
the
word,
history
a
little
while
ago,
then
i
don't
see
what
difference
it
makes
that
it's
written
in
the
constitution,
but
disregarded
its
own
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
history,
very
often
isn't
irrational.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
kidd
against
mccanless
wasn't
passed
on
by
this
court,
mr.
attorney
general.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
wasn't
passed,
it
wasn't
adjudicated
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
therefore,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
you
have
that
ground
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understood
the
value
and
purposes
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
mean
to
imply
because
it
referred
to
wrongs
under
the
state
constitution,
they
had
no
rights
under
the
state
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
is
therefore
that
--
you
should
make
of
the
word
"wrong"
is
a
little
limited.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
ratio
you
gave
a
minute
ago
was
as
of
today
or
as
of
1901?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
was
it
at
1901?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
see
if
i
understand.
in
1901,
according
to
your
mathematics,
11
counties
had
a
larger
representation
and
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
tennessee
constitution.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
since
then
that
disparity
has
increased
merely
because
nothing
was
done
since
1901
and
there's
been
a
shift
in
the
population
between
rural
and
urban,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
the
four.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
a
city,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright
then.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
enacted
the
1901
act.
it's
without
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhyne,
is
there
any
state
constitution
of
any
other
50
states
that
has
an
explicit
provision
aligned
inequality
in
the
voting
rights
or
providing
for
inequality?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
--
i
don't
mean
the
practical
wordings
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
electoral
system.
is
there
any
of
the
fifth
--
in
any
of
the
50
state's
constitution,
is
there
a
provision
authorizing
the
apportionment
of
voting
rights
in
state
representatives
or
for
congressional
representatives
providing
for
inequalities
that
some
region
or
some
classes
or
some
--
whatever
the
distinction
is?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
in
any
terms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
terms.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
trying
to
deal
with
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wasn't
trying
to
deal
with
that
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wanted
to
know
whether
any
state
constitution
authorizes
by
its
constitution
unrelated
to
what
the
federal
constitution
may
have
to
say
about
it
inequality
in
voting
rights.
justice
felix
frankfurter
man
for
man,
man
for
man
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
does
any
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
rural
people
who
want
more
votes
wouldn't
adopt
it
if
it
were
put
into
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
in
the
popular
legislature
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
whether
in
the
popular
legislature.
is
there
any
state
in
the
union
which
in
terms
discriminates
between
man
and
man
as
to
numbers,
not
as
to
--
as
to
the
weight
of
his
voting
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
those
are
op
--
those
are
operating
inequalities.
i'm
talking
about
explicit
inequality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
most
of
the
new
england
states
allow
every
town
where
it
has
20
people
in
it
as
in
new
hampshire,
many
a
town
has
not
more
than
20
or
24
or
20,000,
just
one
representative.
that
is
what
i
was
talking
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
will
be
different
for
you
if
it
weren't
in
the
tennessee
constitution,
exactly
the
same
reapportionment
statute,
exactly
the
same
consequences
but
no
such
provision
as
you
rely
on
it
with
tennessee
constitution,
would
the
case
be
different
for
you
under
the
federal
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
total
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
totality
doesn't
include
the
construction,
the
definitive
construction
by
the
state's
supreme
court
of
the
tennessee
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
hasn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
--
well,
it's
passed
on
it
by
denying
a
right
under
it.
if
that
isn't
passing
on
it,
i
don't
know
what
it's
passing
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
this
the
only
proposal
of
the
governor
of
tennessee
over
the
years
the
legislature
has
not
adopted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
case
in
which
it
has
done
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
tell
me
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
don't
tell
me
the
case
that
i
wrote
is
a
compact
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
against
the
determination
of
the
state
court
that
the
state
constitution
gets
no
legal
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
answer
my
question,
please.
under
--
in
defiance
of
a
state
supreme
court
that
the
state
constitution
creates
no
legal
rights?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
didn't
--
it
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
li
--
litigant
came
before
the
con
--
the
tennessee
court,
it
asked
for
certain
remedies
and
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
with
full
knowledge
of
its
state
constitution
said,
"this
is
not
an
enforceable
legal
right.”
that's
what
that
decision
says
or
it
says
nothing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
how
can
--
did
it
dismiss
the
complaint
or
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
the
chancellor
was
reversed
by
the
higher
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
can't
disagree
that
the
supreme
court
overruled
the
chancellor
and
we
can't
disagree
that
the
supreme
court
denied
relief,
can
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
interrupting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
entitled
to
ask
you
what
you
would
say
to
13
instead
of
15?
that's
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--11,
let
me
begin
with
11.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
do
have
to
think
of
the
road
as
i'm
going
on,
what
kind
of
road
you're
inviting
me
considering
the
fact
that
this
isn't
a
unique
tennessee
situation.
this
isn't
a
unique
tennessee
situation.
the
solicitor
general
gives
heavy
figures
as
to
the
number
of
states
that
are
affected.
from
my
point
of
view,
if
you
are
right,
from
my
point
of
view,
if
you
are
right,
i
see
no
difference
between
writing
into
a
constitution
equal
representation
and
not
writing
in
it
so
far
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
concerned.
justice
felix
frankfurter
where
--
where
--
where
this
is
essential,
where
the
state
power
which
is
ultimately
lodged
in
the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
construing
a
constitutional
provision
says
there's
no
legal
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
have
to
think
about
not
in
this
case.
15
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
to
think
about
maryland
which
i'm
told
is
--
many
(inaudible)
more
disparaged
to
this.i
have
to
think
of
a
lot
of
state
and
not
say
this
is
just
tennessee.
for
me,
this
is
the
united
states,
not
tennessee.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
congress
of
the
united
states
never
dealt
with
this
problem
although
the
inequalities
in
reference
to
congressional
representation
precisely
would
say
and
in
coming
to
this
law
of
flagrancy.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that's
a
--
that's
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
there
choice
of
the
words.
lots
of
people
use
the
word
"integrity"
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
loosely
and
narrowly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
commend
you
--
i
commend
you
the
matters
as
a
dependent
--
dependency
to
the
opinion
in
colegrove
and
green.
i
just
have
you
to
look
at
those
matters
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
then
you'll
see
an
inequality.
justice
felix
frankfurter
will
you
or
the
solicitor
general
tell
us
what
the
remedies
would
be
here
other
than
to
declare
this
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
the
remedy
will
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
rhyne,
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
does
on
the
fact,
just
the
fact,
every
fact
that
you
now
put
before
the
court
taking
into
account,
does
this
case
differ
from
the
fact
in
kidd
and
mccanless
on
the
facts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
disparity
or
from
your
point
of
view,
in
defense
to
one
been
in
mccanless?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
since
the
facts
in
kidd
against
mccanless
were
exactly
the
same
from
the
point
of
view
of
constitutional
consideration,
i
put
this
to
you.
you
talk
as
though
colegrove
against
green,
a
four
to
three
decision
with
justice
rutledge
concurring
with
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
he
did
stood
alone.
kidd
against
mccanless
--
in
kidd
against
mccanless,
he
appealed
to
this
court
on
your
ground
was
dismissed
on
the
--
and
the
basis
for
dismissal
was
given
in
the
per
curiam
because
colegrove
and
green
and
the
anderson
case
were
cited.
so
colgrove
and
green
doesn't
hang
in
this
dubious
situation
in
which
you
indicate
it
does.
not
only
that,
but
the
anderson
case
before
that
also
cited
colegrove
and
green.
and
while
in
the
anderson
case
there
was
a
dissent
noted.
in
kidd
against
mccanless,
no
dissent
was
noted.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
all
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
it
isn't
a
four-to-three
decision
with
one
dubious
and
what
is
more
important
in
kidd
against
mccanless
as
well
as
in
anderson,
a
claim
was
made
that
the
lower
court
decision,
california
in
one
case,
tennessee
in
the
other,
rested
under
state
ground.
this
court
in
dismissing
did
not
take
that
thing.
it
rested
on
colegrove
and
grove
without
qualification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
in
the
--
is
there
anything
in
the
congressional
debate
which
referred
to
--
to
the
federal
--
which
indicated
that
congress
conferred
as
explicitly
as
you
seem
to
indicate,
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court
to
deal
with
the
enforcement
of
state
constitutional
provision
regarding
the
apportionment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
just
answer
that,
yes
or
no.
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
these
of
--
particularly
of
all
colored
--
colored
citizens,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
know
they
didn't
but
all
the
legislation
was
about
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
such
as
the
puerto
ricans?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
others?
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there
is
anything
in
the
--
i'm
asking
you
whether
in
the
debates
there
is
any
reference
to
this
urban
situation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
pass
that,
in
the
browning
case,
did
the
tennessee
supreme
court
say
that
the
tennessee
constitution
didn't
require
equality
of
tax
treatment
or
did
they
say
that
while
it's
in
the
constitution,
50
years
have
elapsed
since
that
has
been
disregarded
which?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
didn't
construe
the
constitution
to
read
otherwise
in
its
language
way
--
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
you
cite
my
academic
interest.
take
the
classic
case
of
(inaudible)
where
a
--
or
take
--
take
a
--
a
famous
singer
befalls
on
that
context
and
mr.
bing,
rudolf
bing
brings
the
proceeding
in
the
new
york
district
court
to
mandatory
injunction.
now,
plainly
enough,
i
suppose
on
a
technical
view,
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
right
he
broke
a
contract,
not
contested,
you
certainly
could
get
damages
against
her
but
a
court
of
equity
would
dismiss
it
because
it
doesn't
enforce
a
personal
service
like
making
a
person
sing
because
that
it
approaches
too
much
in
slavery,
isn't
that
right?
is
that
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
singing
else
where,
yes.
but
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
affirmative,
you
can't
get
the
prayer
that
he
sings
and
carry
out
a
contract,
it
would
be
dismissed,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
this
case.
i'm
trying
to
give
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
--
the
suggestion
of
my
brother
stewart.
she
--
mr.
bing
could
get
a
negative
injunction.
she
shouldn't
sing
--
sing
for
the
new
york
opera
house,
forgot
about
that
or
equity
could
even
retain
the
injunction,
the
--
as
a
subsidiary
to
it
in
order
to
assess
damages.
but
the
--
the
prayer
for
a
mandatory
injunction
certainly
deny,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
are
going
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
are
going
to
tell
us
what
--
you
are
going
to
envisage
possible
remedies
or
tell
us
whether
there
was
any
case
in
this
court
in
which
we
granted
--
in
which
we
recognized
jurisdiction
without
seeing
where
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
leads.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
case
in
which
in
the
abstract,
we
said
there
was
power
without
indicating,
adumbrating
in
some
way
either
money
damages
or
injunction
or
mandamus
or
whatnot.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
solicitor,
may
i
put
this
to
you.
you
belong
to
an
administration
that
has
had
signal
experience
with
the
inability
of
two
houses
of
the
legislature.
you
agree
on
highly
desirable
legislation.
and
it
may
well
be
that
tennessee
may
have
had
difficulties
from
year
to
year
in
getting
the
two
houses
to
agree
to
a
proper
apportionment.
now,
i
take
it
mandamus
couldn't
lie
so
that
the
constitutional
right
derived
from
the
fact
from
two
houses
that
legislate
can't
agree
on
what
is
proper
legislation.
i
didn't
mean
to
be
--
say
anything
except
to
the
call
attention
to
a
well-known
legislative
fact
to
which
the
last
session
of
congress
(inaudible)
administration.
the
difficulty
of
getting
a
comport
between
two
houses
of
a
legislature
and
legislature
will
deem
highly
desirable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
know
that
legislation
doesn't
merely
mean
the
process
of
legislation,
isn't
merely
what
gets
on
the
floor
of
legislatures.
we
know
that
the
legislative
process,
its
agreement
in
what
is
--
the
reference
to
the
(inaudible)
called
the
“cloakroom”,
we
know
that
the
process
involved
agreement
or
disagreement
between
those
who
wield
political
power.
and
it
may
well
be,
looking
ahead
and
i
for
one
has
to
look
ahead,
it
may
well
be
that
this
is
one
of
these
situations.
and
therefore,
it
isn't
merely
--
we're
not
here
engaged
on
abstract
questions.
is
their
jurisdiction
abstractly
considered
but
what
can
you
do
about
it?
not
you
meaning
what
is
--
can
a
court
do
about
it
or
what
is
involved.
i
take
it
you
agree
that
you
couldn't
mandamus
control
apportionments,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
mandamus
a
legislature,
could
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
if
you
can't
go
beyond
that,
that
that
is
a
fair
legal
argument
to
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
you
might
push
them
into
doing
something
which
legally,
you
couldn't
compel
them
to
do
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
the
fair
argument?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
that's
a
fair
argument
to
address
to
this
court
that
you
might
push
them
into
doing
things
although
legally,
you
couldn't
make
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
of
only
one
such
case,
mr.
solicitor,
just
one
such
case.
and
it's
a
case
that
ought
to
give
a
court
force
and
that
is
the
suit
brought
by
virginia
against
west
virginia
which
this
court
dawdled
over
nearly
20
years
because
of
the
difficulties
of
seeing
the
end
of
the
road
in
case
west
virginia
(inaudible)
that
the
court
and
you
couldn't
cease
the
state
house.
there's
just
one
such
case
in
the
whole
history.
i
(inaudible)
you
to
believe
you
couldn't
contradict
that
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
because
all
you're
suggesting,
a
case
where
the
president
of
united
states
was
disobedient
apart
from
the
fact
that
it's
very
dubious
whether
jackson
ever
said
it.nobody
has
been
able
to
trace
the
accuracy
of
that
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
also
the
state
constitutions
have
had
a
particularity,
very
different
from
the
part
--
unparticularity
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
the
federal
court
violate
a
state
constitution
in
order
to
correct
some
vio
--
some
other
--
some
violation
of
another
provision
of
the
state
constitution,
is
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
state
courts
have
state
constitutions
and
different
conceptions
of
judicial
powers
than
this
court
have
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
well
know
--
as
you
well
know.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
can
therefore
invoke
state
courts
which
had
advisory
opinions
which
don't
care
about
the
standing
the
way
this
court
does,
any
number
of
limitation
that
this
court
for
very
good
reason
in
view
of
the
nature
of
its
jurisdiction
has
imposed
upon
itself
as
against
the
provision
of
many,
many
of
state
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
couldn't
enjoin
that
--
could
you
enjoin
an
election
before
there
was
an
appeal
to
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
might
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
a
--
in
an
--
on
a
foreseeable
agreement
without
any
conflict
in
this
court
as
to
what
we
think
about
this
regarding
the
constitution
of
tennessee
on
matters
that
are
not
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
do
you
foresee
--
and
do
you
foresee
that
all
the
30
odd
states,
i
think
that
are
at
least
30
are
involved,
would
at
one
say,
“aye,
aye”,
and
was
one
apportioned
according
to
your
theory?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
draw
encouragement
for
--
for
the
things
that
you
envisioned
from
the
response
that
this
court
has
had
for
its
decree
in
regard
to
an
ever
so
much
a
simpler
situation
of
segregation?
you
ain't
drawing
encouragement
from
the
--
that
lesson
of
experience
with
reference
to
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
say
it's
similar,
i
said
simpler.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
prejudice
is
on
this
business
of
urban
versus
rural
which
is
just
as
strong
in
new
york
as
it
is
in
tennessee?
isn't
this
--
is
not
even
more
deep
seated
and
more
pervasively
seated,
deep-seated?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
would
doubt
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
look
at
the
alibi
of
mapp
for
a
good
illustration.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
what
i
said.
i
said
that
that
decision
isn't
done
nothing.
that
decision
says
there's
no
legal
right
under
that
state
constitution
just
as
it
said
there
was
no
legal
right
in
the
browning
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
giles
and
harris
didn't
go
on
the
ground
--
there's
no
right
in
equity,
it
said
the
case
was
practically
moot
because
the
election
was
almost
over.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
think
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
isn't
the
way
i
read
a
case,
hurry
the
case
for
an
opinion
to
find
out
what
the
opinion
said
although
later
on
it
may
have
had
a
different
(inaudible)
but
the
case
went
on
in
brown,
didn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
is
a
different
--
there
is
a
difference,
lots
of
--
lots
of
things
that
--
for
which
money
damages
are
--
of
court
is
available
for
which
equitable
remedies
are
not
available,
that's
nothings
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we
have
an
equity
--
if
you
go
on
that
narrow
ground,
we've
got
an
equity
case
here.
so,
we
are
going
to
say
that
although
tennessee
didn't
give
an
equitable
right,
we
will
give
an
equitable
right.
i'm
not
saying
that's
impossible.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
there's
a
--
a
rocky
situation
doesn't
mean
a
court
should
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
is
the
fact
that
i'm
still
allowed,
that
brings
us
to
the
opinion?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
can
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
is,
mr.
attorney
general
that
the
selfish
interest
of
those
who
profit
by
this
--
by
these
inequities,
by
this
disparate,
the
selfish
interest,
the
natural
selfish
interest,
not
immoral
but
just
human
nature
being
what
it
is,
always
will
be
a
--
this
is
like
a
loaded
guys,
it
will
always
be
a
loaded
votes
to
retain
the
advantages
they've
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
the
case
did
sound
to
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
--
if
you
start
with
a
hypothetical
case
which
i
appreciated
you're
not
wanting
to
answer
specifically.
but
assume
you
start
with
that
hypothetical
case,
the
solicitor
general,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
didn't
hear
him
today
from
my
--
some
others
did.
but
i
certainly
remember
on
his
first
argument,
he
agreed
that
there
could
be
disparity
between
effectiveness
of
a
rural
voter
and
a
city
voter.
it
make
that
clear
as
veil
because
it
has
left
the
vividly
impression
on
my
mind.
now,
won't
agree
to
that
but
there
may
not
be
mathematical,
arithmetic
equality
as
between
urban
and
rural
voters
then
how
can
you
answer
hypothetically
without
any
disparity?
it
doesn't
represent
considerations
which
in
a
particular
state
of
which
some
of
us
at
least
can't
take
judicial
notice
may
not
find
a
justification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
maybe
in
new
york,
two
to
one
would
be
alright
and
maybe
two
to
one
would
be
wrong
in
some
other
states,
the
distribution
of
the
population
or
the
economic
interest
of
the
geography
or
whatnot,
i
don't
know.
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
once
you
deny
that
--
once
you
reject
the
claim
that
there
must
be
numerically
quality
then
how
can
any
abstract
consideration
except
for
the
answer,
except
with
reference
to
the
circumstances,
the
facts,
the
history
which
can't
be
thrown
out
of
consideration
of
a
particular
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
attorney
general,
can
you
tell
us
cities
(inaudible)
whether
all
urban
counties
are
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
they
--
i
mean
when
you
say
urban
county,
is
that
defined
--
is
that
a
specific
defined
content
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
mean
to
say
in
practice
but
--
but
in
fairness,
when
you
say
an
urban
county,
is
every
urban
county
like
every
other
urban
county?
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
a
matter
officially
i
--
i'm
entitled
to
say
that
--
that
tennessee
is
an
interest
in
political
state,
can
i
say
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
--
when
the
legislature
submits
a
call
for
a
constitutional
convention,
does
it
also
submits
the
specific
subject
matter
of
the
constitutional
convention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
the
--
is
the
scope
of
the
proposed
constitutional
convention
of
subject
matter
for
discussion
in
the
legislature?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words
--
in
other
words,
when
this
call
for
the
1953
and
1959
convention
was
up
and
it
must
have
been,
wasn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
this
--
when
this
proposal
in
the
form
of
a
resolution
or
whatever
the
technical
form,
what
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
resolution.
when
that
resolution
was
up,
was
it
opened
to
the
representatives
of
memphis
to
say,
“we
ought
to
include
the
question
of
apportion?”
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
before
--
before
we
leave
this
interesting
subject,
you
answered
did
you
not
in
before
new
--
before
lunch
a
question
of
the
chief
justice,
which
i'd
like
to
understand.
is
memphis
and
the
other
portion
of
this
always
voted
down
when
they
propose
something?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean
other
than
that
we
should
have
a
holiday
on
the
given
day
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
we
presume
that
it
will
sell
its
clothes
the
line
of
selfishness
as
it's
think
it
justifies.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
have
or
make
a
change
from
say
from
two
thirds
--
from
two-thirds
and
one-third
and
three-fifths
and
two-thirds
and
you
will
then
be
here
again,
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
never
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
of
a
federal
basis
on
which
can
employ
and
bring
a
lawsuit.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
be
here
again?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
if
you
--
if
you
start
with
your
assumption
with
which
mr.
solicitor
general
--
mr.
general
of
the
united
states
does
it
that
there
may
be
differentiation
and
not
equality
between
urban
and
rural
representation
then
the
tennessee
legislature
may
act
on
that
assumption
and
think
three
fifths
of
against
--
as
against
two
thirds
might
satisfy
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
couldn't
then
conscience
he
thinks
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
i
accept
that.
and
i
assume
it
struck
down
when
it
goes
back
to
the
legislature
and
under
the
--
that
will
known
difference
that
the
witness
to
the
south
in
many
states,
they
would
had
once
obeyed
the
law
of
this
--
the
petition
of
this
court,
they
would
pass
a
new
apportionment
act,
changing
the
present
proportion
of
two
thirds
and
one
third
to
three
fifths
and
two
thirds.
you
would
then
be
here
because
i'm
conferencing
what
you
employed
and
wouldn't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
could
no
legislature
conscientiously
think
if
there
maybe,
it
please
a
loading
of
urban
as
against
rural
--
against
--
rural
as
against
urban
that
it
is
not
at
all
democracy
that
--
that
have
been
one
vote,
one
man
throughout
the
state.
they
may
make
a
change
which
would
again
call
it
to
pray
this
process
of
mitigation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
but
then
what
your
conception
is
of
the
function
of
a
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
it
is
the
question
when
you
said
unconstitutional.
it
may
be
unconstitutional
under
the
law
of
tennessee
non-concept
therefore
that
it's
unconstitutional
leaving
the
fourteenth
amendment
so
as
to
give
this
court
power
to
knock
it
down
from
a
very
different
problem.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
don't
you
that
there
maybe
inequality
as
between
urban
and
rural
protest
that
do
not
conflict
with
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
have
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
question
wasn't
--
or
to
accept
that
you
succeed
in
having
this
statute
declared
unconstitutional.
my
question
was
before
seeing
the
next
step,
couldn't
your
legislature
with
entire
conscientiousness
then
they
could
pass
an
reapportionment
statutes
which
from
your
point
of
view
would
raise
the
same
question
which
is
not
altered
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
not.
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
with
your
conscience
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
with
your
conscience
but
their
conscience.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
then
there
would
--
will
be
difference
of
opinion
on
this
court
if
you
were
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
have
no
doubt
about
that
--
i
have
no
doubt
about
that.
but
suppose
the
state
--
suppose
the
tennessee
court
doesn't
say
we
construe
the
decree
of
the
federal
court
but
we
construe
tennessee
law.
you
mean
that
if
the
apportionment
has
been
illegal
since
1901
or
consequences
would
have
never
been
a
valid
legislature,
would
that
be
a
federal
question?
as
the
--
the
case
that
was
put
to
you
by
my
brother
brennan,
specifically
inserted
that
the
state
court
would
be
the
--
in
construing
the
federal
degree
and
i
agree
with
you
that
that
was
solved
and
he
would
really
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
suppose
they
don't
make
any
reference
with
the
federal
decree
and
say
tennessee
law
as
such.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
different
problem
isn't
it?
that's
all
you
have
to
say.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
want
me
to
put
you
an
easy
ones?
