mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
the
question
that
--
that
this
loan
was
for
2%
instead
of
the
normal
interest
rate
with
any
concern
with
us
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then,
would
you
--
would
you
state
why
because
we
may
make
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
do
the
--
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
treat
it?
did
they
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
--
how
did
the
court
treated
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
did
we
get
the
--
the
information
that
this
was
a
2%
loan.
i
don't
see
it
in
the
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
raise
it
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
i
wonder
why
you
can't
speak
for
the
defendant,
can
you
speak
for
the
prosecution
that
this
case
went
back.
wouldn't
the
prosecution
relied
merely
on
the
fact
that
it
--
it
was
a
loan
or
--
or
would
you
do
as
i
gather
from
--
from
the
transcript
that
it
was
an
irregular
transaction
throughout
that
it
could
not
have
been
processed
through
any
financial
institution.
and
that
there
was
only
--
that
the
interest
was
--
was
not
paid
and
that
the
--
it
was
not
the
--
the
interest
on
the
loan
was
--
was
not
a
normal
rate
of
interest.
that's
the
--
that's
what
you're
trying
to
sustain,
this
indictment
on
in
--
in
the
lower
court
as
i
read
this
transcript.
now,
when
it
goes
back,
what
is
the
issue?
is
it
just
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
mere
loan
or
--
or
is
the
issue
that
--
that
it's
a
--
it's
a
fake
loan
that
--
and
that
he
--
he
--
the
borrower
was
acquiring
something
through
that
--
that
loan
that
he
could
not
acquire
through
a
legitimate
loan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
say
it's
a
--
in
the
court,
will
you
get
back
there,
the
prosecution
says
it's
a
loan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
defense
says,
"yes,
it's
a
loan."
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
do
you
then
say,
"well,
we
want
to
show
that
this
--
this
is
not
a
regular
loan."
that
this
is
an
irregular
transaction
and
that
it
had
--
had
ramifications
that
honest
people
wouldn't
indulge
into
--
to
--
in
--
in
making
a
$200,000
loan
and
it
was
not
an
honest
rate
of
interest
and
so
forth
because
all
those
things
were
raised
--
raised
by
the
district
attorney
in
the
court
--
in
the
court
below
at
the
time
this
was
--
at
the
time
this
was
decided
against
you
and
--
and
that's
why
i
was
a
little
surprised
when
you
started
right
up
and
said,
"we'll
make
no
point
of
any
of
that.
we'll
--
we
--
we
just
say
it's
a
loan,
period.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
suppose
you
let
us
decide
on
what
basis
we
took
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
tell
us
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
theory
is.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
want
to
limit
--
limit
it
to
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
here
but
you
--
you
don't
say
how
it
would
be
if
we
decide
it
in
your
favor
when
it
got
back
to
the
--
the
--
to
the
lower
court.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
there's
--
there's
one
thing
in
your
--
in
your
jurisdictional
statement
that
also
bore
on
this
situation,
says,
the
two
counts
of
indictment
filed
on
june
17th,
1959
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
charged
five
defendant
employers
that
having
paid
and
delivers
money
in
the
amount
of
$200,000
to
a
representative
of
their
employees
and
charged
the
defendants'
representative
with
having
received
the
money
in
violation
of
section
302.
in
the
pretrial
memorandum,
the
government
stated
that
it
intended
to
prove
that
the
defendant
employers
had
loaned
$200,000
unsecured
and
at
an
actual
rate
of
about
2%
to
the
defendants
represented
through
an
intricate
exchange
of
checks.
now,
why
should
we
--
why
should
we
have
overlooked
that
when
we
--
when
we
granted
this
--
when
we
know
that
probable
jurisdiction.
why
did
you
state
that
to
us
if
you
didn't
want
us
to
believe
that
--
that
that
was
the
situation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
just
say
that
the
sole
question
is
whether
--
whether
there
was
a
--
a
loan
of
$200,000?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
might
have
saved
a
lot
of
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
did
--
but
you
did
in
your
jurisdictional
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
wouldn't
--
then
you
wouldn't
maintain
the
law
that
it
was
not
a
bona
fide
loan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we've
got
--
we've
got
it
from
justice
frankfurter
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nizer.
[laughter]
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
nizer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nizer,
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nizer,
may
i
--
may
i
just
inject
this
at
this
point,
mr.
nizer.
it
seems
to
me
that
from
reading
this
transcript,
that
this
position
as
to
--
as
to
whether
it
was
a
loan
was
rather
forced
on
the
--
on
the
prosecution,
rather
than
him
accepting
them.
mr.
guzzetta
said
on
page
14
of
the
record
that
he
hoped
to
make
this
as
clear
as
the
trial
progresses
that
their
position
is
actually
two-fold,
he
says,
"a
loan
if
your
honor
please,
is
something
that
relates
to
a
state
of
mind
between
the
person
who
is
receiving
the
money
and
the
person
who
is
giving
the
money
and
again,
the
repayment
which
actually
occurred
in
this
case
is
only
one
aspect
to
whether
or
not
the
transfer
of
funds
between
one
party
or
from
one
party
to
another
is
actually
a
loan."
then
there
was
--
there
was
an
argument
over
several
pages
and
the
judge
intimated
that
the
government
--
that
the
government
was
to
be
bound
by
the
first
three
or
four
pages
of
that
memorandum
which
had
been
submitted.
and
mr.
guzzetta
said,
"i
think
your
honor,
we
are
limited
to
the
four
corners
of
the
indictment
although
you
may
disagree
with
me
on
this
point."
and
the
court
said
very
strongly,
"mr.
guzzetta,
because
my
brief
is
only
the
first
three
or
four
pages,
which
your
honor
read
from
and
the
court
interrupts,
the
first
three
or
four
pages
dealt
with
what
you
promised
to
prove
the
facts."
mr.
guzzetta,
"precisely,
as
supplemented
by
my
statement
in
case
there
was
ambiguity.
i
don't
know
that
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
ever
bound
the
government
before
like
this."
the
court,
"well,
mr.
guzzetta,
i've
had
the
experience
where
a
man
got
up
before
a
jury
and
got
kicked
out
on
his
opening
statement."
and
mr.
guzzetta
said
this,
"that's
a
different
matter.
my
opening
statement
is
yet
to
come."
and
then,
the
court
adopted
this
--
this
theory
and
this
interpretation
of
--
of
a
--
an
indictment
that
was
valid.
and
can
--
can
this
court
be
bound
by
that
order
of
the
district
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
14,
i
think
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
a
question
of
fact,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
take
two
or
three
minutes
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
hearing
before
or
after
the
judgment
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before.
