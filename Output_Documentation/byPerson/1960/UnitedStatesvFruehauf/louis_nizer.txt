the
notice
of
appeal
as
set
forth
on
the
question
presented
on
this
appeal
on
page
48
of
the
transcript
of
record,
bears
out,
my
learned
friend's
statement
that
this
question
as
a
jurisdictional
matter
is
limited
to
the
assumption
of
a
bona
fide
loan
because
there,
the
question
is
presented
as
to
whether
the
payment
of
money
by
an
employer
to
a
representative
of
his
employees
intending
repayment
of
said
money
with
interest
is
within
the
proscription
of
section
302.
and
in
page
2
of
the
brief
of
the
government,
the
questions
stated
a
little
more
elliptically
is
--
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
loan
of
money
comes
within
the
foregoing
prohibitions
and
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
is
based
upon
that
assumption
under
the
havas
case.
or
else,
if
there
were
any
questions
of
fact
and
we
differ
incidentally
with
the
statements
that
had
been
repeatedly
made
here
but
to
be
consistent
--
mr.
louis
nizer
--
with
the
fact
that
this
is
the
sole
question
before
your
honors.
we
wish
to
point
out
that
under
the
havas
case
which
your
honors
recently
decided,
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court
that
this
weren't
simply
a
matter
of
construction
of
the
statute
on
the
assumption
of
a
bona
fide
loan
as
stated
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
if
congress
had
intended
to
proscribe
loans
as
well
as
gifts
in
the
original
act,
it
could've
done
so
simply
by
adding
the
word
"lend"
and
"loan"
as
it
did
12
years
later
when
after
congressional
investigations
in
mcclellan
committee
hearings.
it
appeared
that
there
were
a
number
of
loan
transactions
at
which
time
senator
kennedy
set
upon
the
record
as
it
appears.
"this
isn't
against
the
law
but
don't
you
think
we
ought
to
do
something
about
this
situation?"
and
the
amendment
resulted
thereafter.
but
there
is
one
aspect
to
this
problem
which
--
about
which
we
can
be
dogmatic,
said
this
court
in
the
bell
case,
it
is
that
when
congress
has
the
will,
it
can
express
it
particularly
in
so
simple
a
matter
as
an
evidence
that
could
do
in
this
case.
indeed,
there
are
two
contemporaneous
statutes
within
one
year
of
this
one
in
which
congress
was
not
contempt
with
the
word
payment
or
gift
or
contribution
but
did
provide
lend
and
loan
in
the
statute.
and
most
significantly
your
honors,
in
those
cases
too,
the
language
appeared,
payment
of
money
or
other
thing
of
value.
and
the
congress
did
not
deem
the
words
"or
anything
of
value"
to
encompass
a
loan,
and
specifically
provided
the
word
lend
and
loan.
the
classic
tenant
of
construction
with
respect
to
common
words
even
in
none
criminal
statutes
and
particularly,
i
stress
in
the
penal
statute
which
is
malum
prohibitum
and
requires
fair
warning
to
the
citizens.
is
that
the
verbs
will
be
given
the
limitation
of
their
ordinary
market
place
use,
even
though
linguists
and
scholars
may
define
larger
meanings
for
them.
so
the
word
“pay”
in
market
place
usage,
means
"to
discharge
an
obligation,"
it
doesn't
mean
"to
initiate
one"
as
you
do
when
you
make
a
loan.
there
are
many
synonyms
for
the
word
pay
on
the
dictionaries
but
no
one
will
find
lend
as
one
of
those
synonyms.
and
similarly,
the
word
“deliver”,
in
its
market
place
usage
which
is
required
for
fair
warning
to
the
average
citizen
malum
prohibitum
statute.
the
word
“deliver”
is
never
associated
with
loan.
you
don't
deliver
a
loan,
you
make
one,
as
this
court
said
in
the
western
union
lend
group
case
were
the
word
was
ship
or
commodity,
child
labor
statute.
ship
did
not
apply
to
a
telegram.
you
don't
ship
a
telegram,
you
send
it.
the
statute
clearly
fails
to
proscribe
and
wasn't
ever
intend
to
proscribe
loans
at
the
time
that
it
was
enacted.
and
therefore,
it
is
not
proper
we
think
for
the
government
to
presume
that
this
language
maybe
ambiguous.
as
this
court
said
in
the
bell
case
when
congress
leaves
to
the
judiciary
the
task
of
imputing
to
congress
an
undeclared
will,
the
ambiguity
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
lenity,
even
ambiguity
wouldn't
aid
the
government
in
this
situation.
nor,
may
the
government
presume
that
in
order
to
effectuate
the
beneficent
purpose
of
the
statute
that
it
should
be
broadened
to
cover
other
categories
which
congress
in
its
wisdom
might
well
have
found
consistent
with
its
general
purpose.
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
that
invitation
stating
at
one
case.
it
is
congress
which
defines
the
penal
law.
it
is
congress
which
defines
the
crime
that
ordains
the
punishment,
not
the
court.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
it
was
very
incorrect
in
this
case
because
they
charged
that
the
delivery
--
the
payment
was
$200,000,
a
thing
of
value
to
wit
$200,000
period.
they
omitted
the
fact
that
it
was
loan
--
mr.
louis
nizer
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
counsel
who
tried
the
case
for
the
government,
united
states
attorney.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
--
the
--
your
honor
has
put
his
finger
on
the
knob
of
the
matter
with
respect
to
that
discussion
with
government
counsel.
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
our
position
that
this
raises
solely
a
matter
of
construction
with
respect
to
whether
a
bona
fide
loan
is
a
violation
of
the
statute,
i
shall
not,
even
under
the
invitation
of
that
question,
state
to
your
honor
the
facts
which
where
alleged
in
this
very
record,
which
indicated
its
bona
fides
and
full
interest
and
all
the
rest.
mr.
louis
nizer
they
did
not
sir,
that's
right.
but
when
they
found
the
dismissal
on
their
hands
and
wished
to
present
the
question
which
would
permit
them
jurisdictionally
to
come
directly
to
this
court
and
bypass
the
court
of
appeals,
as
your
honor
indicated,
might
have
been
the
situation
if
there
were
a
factual
issue.
they
then
phrased
the
question
on
page
48
on
their
appeal,
assuming
even
the
total
repayment
with
interest
and
incidentally,
that
was
conceded
here
that
the
whole
loan
had
been
repaid
long
before
there
was
an
investigation
before
the
mcclellan
committee
and
also
interest.
but
there
was
a
dispute
that
arose
and
incidentally,
it's
a
dispute
not
conceded
as
to
whether
it
was
the
$8,000
interest
or
the
$4,000
interest.
in
order
to
avoid
those
factual
issues
which
would
not
have
entitled
it
to
come
directly
to
this
court?
they
presented
the
question
as
an
abstract
academic
question
as
to
whether
a
loan,
a
bona
fide
loan
but
full
interest
on
--
collateralized
in
all
the
other
conditions
imposed
is
a
violation
of
this
statute.
they
not
only
said
that
at
page
48
in
their
notice
of
appeal
but
in
their
brief
at
page
2.
mr.
louis
nizer
then
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
louis
nizer
we
think
that's
a
fetal
variance
for
that
matter
but
to
answer
your
question
directly,
your
honor
as
we
see
it.
i
think
that
the
government,
by
its
position,
has
bound
this
court
to
consider
this
appeal
solely
on
the
question
of
bona
fide
loan
and
that
it
cannot
now
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
that
this
court
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
nizer
if
it
were
only
the
construction
of
this
question
which
is
what
the
havas
case
which
your
honors
recently
decided,
a
very
recent
case
on
jurisdictional
rights
on
direct
appeal,
was
to
the
effect
that
unless
the
construction
of
the
statute
as
determined
by
the
lower
court
is
the
sole
issue
before
the
court.
and
i
--
this
--
this
court
will
not
entertain
jurisdiction
and
has
not.
and
therefore,
we
are
not
here
at
all
properly
unless
mr.
gillespie
takes
the
position
he's
honorably
taken
in
the
matter,
the
case
is
united
states
against
havas,
355
u.s.
the
decision
having
been
rendered
on
the
basis
of
government
admission
below
with
respect
to
basic
facts
despite
the
statement
which
seems
confusing
that
mr.
guzzetta
made.
i
can
point
out
that
in
the
entire
argument,
that
statement
was
not
only
contradicted
but
indeed,
there
was
evidence
given
as
conceded
in
the
government's
brief
that
would
indicate
that
there
wasn't
even
a
relationship
between
this
loan
and
any
labor
relations.
it
was
for
example,
illustrated
at
page
31
that
appears
in
the
record,
that
there
was
a
--
only
289,
page
18
of
the
record,
only
289
employees
of
10,000
in
this
company
that
even
belong
to
this
union
and
they
never
negotiated
the
contract
with
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
precisely,
and
i
--
i
say
that
there
are
many
questions
of
fact
which
are
in
this
record
which
your
honor
referred
to
mr.
guzzetta's
statement.
and
i
say
that
is
all
out
in
this
case,
and
that
we
are
here
on
this
sole
legal
question
as
mr.
gillespie,
i
think
rightly
said
and
is
constrained
to
say,
i
don't
think
there
is
--
would
be
jurisdiction
otherwise
that
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
government
chooses
to
exercise
it
prerogatives
of
a
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
and
if
this
court
entertains
it,
we
made
a
motion
to
affirm.
we
didn't
think
there
was
even
a
question
here
that
was
worthy
of
this
argument,
we
were
wrong.
but
if
this
court
chooses
to
entertain
that
matter,
i
think
the
government
has
concluded
itself
from
any
other
position
and
i
think
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so
as
this
court
precluded
by
its
procedure.
mr.
louis
nizer
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
put
it
as
broadly
as
that,
your
honor,
though
that
maybe
a
part
of
it.
i
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
i
--
mr.
louis
nizer
oh,
i
think
it
can.
but
i
say
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
that
far
by
the
procedure
of
this
appeal
presenting
this
question
that's
the
only
thing
left
for
this
court
and
think
that
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
i
think
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
may
i
--
in
order
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
didn't
amend
but
it
was
a
judicial
admission
and
was
so
held
to
be
by
the
court
and
i
think
rightly
so
and
it's
repeatedly
made
again
and
again.
the
judicial
admission
is
that
this
was
a
loan
fully
pre
--
repaid
within
a
year
--
several
years
before
it
came,
before
the
mcclellan
committee.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
that
is
a
vice,
which
if
anything
is
not
to
be
charged
against
us
but
would
make
a
--
a
return
to
the
court
of
appeals,
a
futile
act.
we
think
that
this
indictment
in
itself
is
at
such
variance
with
the
statement
of
the
government
on
this
appeal
and
in
the
court
below
that
it
couldn't
be
sustained
in
any
event.
there
wasn't
a
payment
of
$200,000.
there
wasn't.
and
i
think
it
shows
a
self-doubt
that
the
drafters
of
the
indictment
that
they
could
frankly
state
that
it
was
a
loan
because
they
thought
the
indictment
would
be
dismissed
if
they
stated
that
frankly.
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
it's
conceded
that
it
was.
you
--
your
honors
on
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
louis
nizer
may
i
--
mr.
louis
nizer
may
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
point
i
wish
to
argue
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
this
statute,
may
make
academic
even
the
question
which
seems
to
be
troubling
us
as
to
what
the
proper
procedure
is
with
respect
to
this
because
i
don't
think
there
will
be
any
difficulty
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
make
the
following
point
which
encompasses
both.
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
not
on
the
merits.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
clearly
under
the
criminal
appeals
act,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
a
construction
of
a
statute
by
a
district
court.
and
the
havas
case
held
precisely
that
this
court
has
been
limiting
by
its
own
choice
to
that
construction.
and
therefore,
i
think
this
court
--
this
case
is
properly
here
on
the
only
way
in
which
it
could've
gotten
here
which
the
government
chose
but
i
should
like
to
make
the
following
argument
because
i
think
it
throws
an
umbrella
over
the
whole
question
so
that
we
needn't
worry
about
where
the
shape
holds.
the
whole
point
of
the
governments
position
seems
to
be
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
put
in
a
position
as
if
i
were
cuddling
about
technical
matters
while
the
moral
issues
were
against
us.
the
whole
point
of
the
government's
position
seems
to
be
that
it
is
--
wishes
to
be
in
the
posture
of
seeking
to
preserve
the
beneficent
purpose,
the
high
and
concededly
proper
ethical
purpose
of
this
statute
against
delimitation.
i
want
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that
bribery
which
has
been
mentioned
here
just
like
theft
and
murder
is
malum
in
se.
it
requires
a
proof
of
criminal
intention
which
is
a
defense
opportunity,
it
--
it's
a
protection
for
the
accused.
and
on
those
cases
whether
the
act
is
as
clear
as
it
might
be
isn't
of
great
importance
because
the
defendant
was
about
to
commit
a
--
a
wrong
against
the
moral
order
which
he
knew
irrespective
of
language.
but
this
statute
is
malum
prohibitum
and
more
remarkably,
no
criminal
intension
need
be
proven,
the
prosecutor's
way
is
eased,
has
--
has
been
indicated
here
just
to
prove
a
loan
no
matter
how
innocent
they
say
would
convict
this
man.
and
in
such
a
case,
this
court,
as
an
old
tradition
has
held
that
there
must
be
the
clearest
and
fairest
warning
to
the
citizens
so
that
that
which
was
legal
yesterday
and
is
now
illegal,
he
may
know
precisely
what
that
is.
when
the
congress
carves
out
of
the
permissive
area,
a
zone
which
it
says,
"henceforth,
is
criminal."
the
obligation
upon
it
for
clarity
to
the
citizen
is
of
the
greatest
moment.
there
is
no
room
here
for
arguments
about
refinements
of
language,
double
meaning,
ambiguity.
the
fact
that
lawyers
can
honestly
differ
on
this
is
at
self
fatal
to
this
statute
and
that
is
why
your
honors,
i
call
your
honors
attention
to
the
kind
decisions
you
have
rendered.
for
example,
a
self-propelled
vehicle,
motor
vehicle,
not
running
on
rails
may
not
be
shipped,
not
held
to
apply
to
an
airplane,
even
though
we
know
an
airplane
is
self-propelled
and
doesn't
run
on
vehicles
on
--
on
rails
but
if
congress
meant
that
it
should've
said
--
said
that
in
a
malum
prohibitum
statute.
a
statute
which
says
that
you
may
not
ship
indecent
books,
papers
or
writings
is
not
held
to
apply
to
a
letter
because
if
congress
meant
to
warn
the
citizens
that
he
may
not
send
an
indecent
letter,
it
should've
included
the
word
lend.
a
statute
which
says,
"spirituous
liquors
or
wines
are
forbidden,"
in
interstate
commerce
under
certain
circumstances
does
not
apply
to
log
a
beer
and
this
court
even
made
the
observation
when
they
was
--
the
point
made
that
there
was
scientific
evidence
of
its
alcoholic
content.
the
court
said,
"the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
give
fair,

evidence

a
statute
which
forbids
the

of
a
knife
is
held
not
to
apply

if
congress
--
if
the
legislature
meant
it.
now,
these
--
this
type
of
decision,
which
applies
peculiarly
in
malum
prohibitum
cases
comes
with
greater
impact
in
this
case
because
it
has
been
held
in
this
case
that
the
criminal

not

so,
we
have
a
decent
citizen
of
impeccable
reputation.
i'm
talking
of
the
clients
we
represent
who
would
not
have
made
a
loan,
had
he
known,
had
he
been
given
fair
warning
that
the
lend
or
loan
as
was
put
12
years
later
in
the
statute
was
prohibited.
whose
lawyers
would
not
have
permitted
him
to
do
this
act,
makes
a
loan
which
is
repaid
concededly
and
now
--
mr.
louis
nizer
i
should
like
to
make
three
answers
to
that
observation,
your
honor,
if
your
honor
will
permit.
first,
i
call
to
your
attention
that
that
entire
colloquy
with
mr.
guzzetta
begins
by
his
stating,
"and
again,
the
repayment
which
actually
occurred
in
this
case,"
and
then
he
goes
on,
"to
argue
about
requirements."
that
followed,
the
court's
citation
on
page
10
or
11,
your
honor
read
from
page
13,
14
--
mr.
louis
nizer
immediately
14,
immediately
before,
that
your
honors
--
mr.
louis
nizer
--
will
find
a
quotation
from
the
brief
filed
by
the
government
in
which
it
can
state
it
clearly
that
the
facts
which
the
government
intended
to
prove
in
its
brief,
not
mr.
guzzetta's
second
thoughts
on
the
matter.
but
the
facts
which
they
intended
to
prove
was
that
there
was
a
$200,000
loan
that
it
was
repaid
in
full.
it
was
originally
supposed
to
have
been
placed
with
a
bank.
the
only
request
was
to
help
them
place
it
and
incidentally,
it
was
later
as
this
record
shows,
placed
with
the
manufacturers
trust
company,
that's
at
page
19.
and
it
was
fully
repaid
with
full
interest
to
the
manufacturers
trust
company.
this
was
an
intro
of
stopgap
arrangement
and
the
fact
that
it
was
stopgap
also
appears
on
page
19
as
your
honors
--
as
your
honor
will
see.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
that's
what
your
honor
read
with
respect
to
mr.
guzzetta's
promises.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
i
--
i
observed.
my
second
answer
therefore
is
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
waive
the
position
taken
there
which
it
did
not
only
in
its
memorandum
but
subsequently
thereto
and
on
this
appeal.
and
i
think
the
government
is
bound
by
its
waiver
of
its
position.
and
i
don't
think
that
in
its
waiver,
it
sacrificed
anything,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
your
honor
would
want
me
to
be
drawn
into
a
factual
analysis
that
appears
in
this
record
because
that
would
be
arguing
the
facts.
but
they
--
the
reason,
your
honor,
may
surmise
that
they
waived
all
of
that
was,
that
there
was
nothing
that
they
could
have
preserved
if
they
haven't
waived
it.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
think
(inaudible)
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
and
your
honor,
to
demonstrate
how
true
that
is,
i
didn't
wish
to
make
the
motion
until
the
opening
of
counsel.
and
the
court
then
said,
"so
far
as
what
is
that
you
wish
the
opening
of
counsel
to
demonstrate?"
i
said,
"the
loan,"
and
he
said,
"well,
let's
submit
again,"
he
read
it
into
record.
that's
precisely
how
it
occurred
and
i
may
say
with
respect
to
judge
sugarman
that
he
did
this
knowledgeably
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
the
government's
right
to
appeal
directly
here.
he
said
so
and
spoke
to
counsel
later
and
said,
"i
wanted
this
without
an
opening
so
that
there
would
be
no
double
jeopardy."
he
was
doing
this
to
help
--
pardon.
mr.
louis
nizer
help
the
government.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
mr.
justice
black,
i
was
present
and
i
may
say
to
your
honor
that
the
record
would
show
that
the
government
counsel,
mr.
guzzetta
did
not
really
go
that
far.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
i
know
page
34
but
the
entire
colloquy
and
the
statement
read
into
the
record
and
the
present
question
on
appeal
indicates
clearly.
and,
if
your
honor
will
be
good
enough
to
read
my
statement
of
--
on
the
motion
as
to
what
the
facts
were
because
at
that
time,
it
was
proper
to
argue
the
matter,
your
honors
will
see
that
on
the
conceded
documents
that
were
referred
to,
there
couldn't
be
any
question
of
a
doubt.
but
that
this
was
a
bona
fide
loan,
indeed,
it
was
even
collateralized
as
i
argue.
mr.
louis
nizer
but
isn't
that
what
your
honor
is
--
mr.
louis
nizer
but
the
reason
that
the
court
held
that
he
had
waived
it
was
because
he
did
still
not
deny
the
facts
in
the
memorandum
which
were
filed
have
he
said
--
mr.
louis
nizer
--
the
fact.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
louis
nizer
they
do
not
now
claim
that
it
was
a
bogus
loan,
they
cannot
so
claim
it
was
repaid
long
before
there
was
even
an
inquiry
before
the
mcclellan
committee
and
they
have
so
conceded.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
if
--
if
the
--
if
the
proposition
is,
may
i
respectfully
say
to
your
honor,
that
if
the
proposition
is
that
the
government
may
not
waive
that
issue
as
it
has
today
on
a
number
of
occasions
in
its
brief
and
by
taking
this
appeal,
then
i
am
wrong.
but
if
i
understand
that
the
government
has
a
right
to
say,
"i
waive
all
these
considerations
and
i'm
here
solely
on
the
academic
question
which
is
raised
on
the
construction
of
statute
and
i
should
think
they
are
bound
by
that
and
that
there
is
nothing
immoral
or
improper
and
they're
waiving
something,
that's
for
their
judgment
to
do.
and
i
don't
think
that
they
exercise
their
judgment
with
any
sacrifice
to
government
position."
since
my
time
is
running
out,
i
would
make
your
indulgence
to
make
just
one
of
the
brief
points.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
i
don't
--
do
not
wish
to
exceed
my
time.
and
that's
the
matter
of
the
amendment
and
the
alleged
legislative
history
with
respect
to
that
amendment.
there
could
not
be
anything
more
conclusive
than
the
legislative
history
with
respect
to
this
amendment
in
demonstrating
conclusively
that
it
was
--
that
the
loan
was
not
previously
proscribed
and
that
it
is
now
under
the
amendment
for
the
first
time.
i
refer
only
to
a
few
matters.
and
since
my
time
is
virtually
up,
i
would
like
to
indicate
them
elliptically.
mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you
judge.
thank
you.
first,
i
have
indicated
that
senator
kennedy,
when
this
very
transaction
came
before
him
and
there
were
a
number
of
other
loans
in
other
industries
said
and
the
government
admits
this
in
its
brief,
at
page
10
and
33
of
its
brief
that
the
judge
--
senator
kennedy
said,
"there
is
no
law
against
it,"
meaning
this
very
transaction,
"but
don't
you
think
this
raises
ethical
questions
that
we
have
or
to
take
cognizance
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
after
this
was
testified.
this
--
this
incident
having
occurred
three
or
four
years
before
and
having
been
repaid
whatnot.
but
there
were
other
incidents,
and
at
this
time
he
said,
"there's
no
law
against
it
but
let
me
ask
mr.
fruehauf,"
the
very
defendant
here."
don't
you
think
this
raises
ethical
questions
and
we
ought
to
take
some
cognizance
and
do
something
about
it?"
and
counsel
read
from
the
senate
introduction,
the
preamble,
the
word
"loophole."
somebody
put
it
a
little
more
meanly
and
said
there
were
loopholes
and
the
statute
is
going
to
plug
them.
doesn't
that
indicate
that
this
was
not
prohibited
originally?
then
senator
goldwater,
who
is
also
a
member
of
the
committee,
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
"this
adds
a
prohibition
on
any
loan,
adds
with
respect
to
this
amendment."
mr.
meany
the
cio,
the
president
said,
"this
insane
in
substance."
mr.
robert
kennedy
who
was
counsel
for
the
mcclellan
committee
wrote
a
letter
to
all
congressmen
indicating
the
purpose
of
the
amendment.
and
in
that
letter
he
said
at
page
24,
"it
prohibits
loans
by
employers."
representative
elliot,
who
was
the
cosponsor
of
this
amendment
said,
"it
adds
--
adds
to
the
existing
proscription,
the
fact
that
you
may
not
lend
money."
mr.
louis
nizer
long
before
the
hearing.
mr.
louis
nizer
long
before,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
the
sequence
here
is,
the
loan
is
made
in
1954,
repaid
in
1955,
mcclellan
committee
1957,
amendment,
1959.
and
your
honor,
the
harvard
law
review,
from
an
academic
viewpoint
analyzing
this
also
and
we
quote,
it
says,
"this
adds
a
proscription.
loans
are
now
prohibited."
and
i
wish
therefore
to
conclude
with
this
observation,
that
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
the
government
position,
which
is
that
this
was
merely
clarified.
something
that
already
existed
in
the
statute
is
that
if
it
is
necessary
to
clarify.
if
there
is
even
that
much
doubt
taking
it
on
that
extreme
posture,
then
under
these
prohibitum
cases
where
criminal
intention
needn't
be
proved
and
a
citizen
should
be
given
fair
warning,
that
in
itself
is
fatal
to
the
kind
of
a
statute
which
does
not
give
a
warning
and
tell
a
man
that
from
henceforth,
you
may
not
make
a
loan.
for
under
common
law,
it
was
not
illegal
to
make
even
a
gift,
not
only
a
loan
and
the
citizen
should
have
been
told
that.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
there's
only
one
other
case
pending
since
1947
to
this
date
involving
a
loan.
this
is
not
a
matter
which
involves
a
large
evasion
of
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
in
1959,
this
amendment
was
passed
and
henceforth
every
citizen
knows
there
can
be
no
transaction
involving
a
loan
bona
fide
or
--
or
otherwise.
so
that
this
is
academic,
it's
a
moot
proposition
involving
this
one
case
under
circumstances
where
no
warning
was
given
to
this
citizen.
it
therefore
appears
to
us
that
there's
no
need,
even
if
there
would
be
merit
otherwise,
in
a
procedure
which
would
send
this
back
for
other
procedures.
if
it
matters
in
your
honor's
discretion,
i
should
think
it
would
exercise
your
discretion
to
close
this
matter
for
there
is
nothing
more
involved
in
the
case
and
it
was
justly
construed
in
the
first
instance.
thank
you
--
