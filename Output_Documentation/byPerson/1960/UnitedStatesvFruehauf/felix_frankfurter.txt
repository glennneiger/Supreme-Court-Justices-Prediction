unless
the
--
i
beg
your
pardon
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
mr.
gillespie
or
rather
qualify
your
statement
that
this
court
must
treat
it
in
the
terms
in
which
you
put
it
to
us,
unless
--
my
unless
is
unless
the
record
justifiably,
it's
going
to
be
approved
that
this
is
a
--
a
contrive
case
and
i
think
that
there's
nothing
to
justify
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
if
--
if
congress
had
used
senator
taft's
language
prohibiting
any
union
officials
from
obtaining
money
for
his
use,
you
--
you
wouldn't
be
here
and
wouldn't
be
bothered
with
the
problem
which
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i'm
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
specific
exceptions
are
there,
mr.
gillespie?
justice
felix
frankfurter
five.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
--
is
there
one
binding
--
principle
of
binding
differentiation
of
--
among
the
five?
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
amendment
came
after
this
--
this
provision,
did
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
reference
made
to
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
there
any
reference
made
to
this
--
to
this
litigation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
as
--
in
the
hearings
before
the
mcclellan
committee,
did
non-prosecuted
loans
lay
on,
particularly,
is
it
part
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
against
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
outright
gifts?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
your
whole
argument
presupposes
that
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
the
legislation
that
a
fair
reading
must
--
and
a
part
of
the
word
almost
necessarily
that
it
would
be
torturing
what
is
now
written
to
exclude
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
your
position?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
see
if
i
understand
it,
the
answer
you
made
first
to
justice
black
and
chief
justice.
you
say
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
this
indictment
is
sustained,
you
would
put
into
evidence
by
whatever
witness
or
documents
necessary,
the
naked
facts
of
this
loan
and
if
you
chose,
you
would
say,
your
--
the
government
rests
and
would
feel
that
the
district
judge
if
the
defendant
also
rest
to
that
and
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
fact
that
it's
within
your
prosecutorial
privilege
to
do
what
prosecutors
usually
do
trying
to
make
in
it
--
sometimes
redundant,
a
superfluous
additional
testimony
to
make
the
jury
understand
the
human
implications
of
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
nizer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
say
that
i'm
on
both
sides
of
this
case.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
answer
carries
with
it
or
underlying
your
answer
is
an
assumption,
namely
that
--
that
the
government
can
bind
--
that
the
government
can
bind
itself
to
contract
the
scope
of
an
indictment
which
includes,
not
only
a
question
that
can
come
here
but
it
left
at
large
the
question
that
couldn't
come
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
saying
you
can't
do
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
think
it
goes
right
back
to
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
court
has
on
more
than
one
occasion,
i
think
within
my
time,
had
obtained
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
what's
purported
to
be
a
direct
review
from
a
district
court
then
when
it
got
here,
found
that
other
prices
were
implicated
which
required
the
case
to
be
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
that
route
or
that
disposition
can
be
avoided
in
this
case
as
i
see
it
only
on
the
assumption
that
the
government
can
and
having
power
to
do
so,
did
restrict
the
proof
--
the
only
proof
which
it
has
prepared
to
present
under
this
broader
indictment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
understood
mr.
gillespie.
that's
what
he's
undertaking
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
didn't
amend
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
can't
pass
on
whether
it
was
or
wasn't
a
loan,
can
we,
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
the
--
if
the
intervention
of
justice
black
a
minute
ago
is
pertinent.
if
the
grand
jury
charge
something
which
is
not
provable
under
it,
because
it's
a
different
thing
once
to
be
proved
or
a
--
or
a
contracted
thing
was
to
be
proved
which
couldn't
be
contracted,
then
we
can
entertain
it
and
the
case
should
be
properly
here.
and
i
revert
to
my
question
or
rather
my
statement.
i
believe
was
to
be
correct,
that
underlying
both
conditions
must
be
the
assumption
that
what
was
put
to
judge
sugarman,
namely,
that
the
government
says,
"hereafter,
we
will
--
under
this
indictment
as
they
may
assuming
the
law
with
them."
prove
the
indictment
by
proving
the
loan,
whether
they
can
shut
the
door
for
everything
else
by
that
restriction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
i
see
no
reason
why
the
government
can
by
bill
of
particulars,
restrict
itself
what
it
occurred
to
prove
under
the
indictment
which
allowed
them
to
prove
more.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
make
--
if
you
make
the
argument
that
you
made
in
resisting
the
entertainment
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
and
if
you
make
the
argument
on
the
merits,
it
doesn't
help
us.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
--
it
--
it
can't
--
it
can't
possibly
confirm
that
what
this
get
down
to,
is
this
an
effort
or
i
mean
any
purpose
to
one
that
this
involves
an
assumption
of
jurisdiction
which
we
haven't
got.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
the
thing
--
the
truth
of
the
matter,
mr.
nizer,
with
this
one
--
one
observation
that
an
old
lawyer
might
make
and
takes
in
as
much
--
as
much
of
modernity
as
he
can?
every
once
in
a
while,
we
call
you
--
you
have
price
purchase.
it's
true
to
the
matter
that
this
is
an
evil
result
of
a
pretrial
conference
that
50
years
ago,
if
this
had
come
up,
the
case
could
have
gone
to
trial.
and
if
the
case
had
gone
to
trial,
mr.
gillespie
or
his
--
one
of
his
assistants
would've
made
an
opening
statement.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
in
the
opening
statement,
the
jury
would
have
been
told
they
are
going
to
prove
a
loan,
you
would've
moved
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed
on
the
opening
statement
of
counsel.
and
if
judge
sugarman
has
then
made
the
ruling
that
he
did.
i
can't
imagine
that
we
wouldn't
have
had
a
right
of
appeal.
