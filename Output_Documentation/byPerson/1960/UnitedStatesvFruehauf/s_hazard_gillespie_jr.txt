mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
government
appeals
by
direct
appeal
from
the
oral
ruling
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
dismissing
an
indictment
on
motion
before
trial.
the
indictment
which
is
in
the
record
is
in
two
counts.
charges
in
the
first
count
that
all
of
the
defendants
except
the
defendant
dave
beck
were
employers
of
employees
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
and
unlawfully
paid
and
delivered
and
agreed
to
pay
and
deliver
to
dave
beck,
president
of
the
international
brotherhood
of
teamsters,
a
representative
of
the
employees
mentioned,
a
thing
of
value
to
wit
money
in
the
amount
of
$200,000.
the
second
count
charges
that
the
defendant
dave
beck
received
and
accepted
and
agreed
to
receive
and
accept
a
thing
of
value,
to
wit,
this
money,
in
the
amount
of
$200,000.
the
close
of
each
count,
it
is
stated
that
the
acts
alleged
in
the
respective
counts,
constitute
a
violation
of
section
302
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947,
the
taft-hartley
act,
which
specifically
makes
it
"unlawful”
for
any
employer
to
pay
or
deliver
or
to
agree
to
pay
or
deliver
any
money
or
other
thing
of
value
to
any
representative
of
any
of
his
employees
who
are
employed
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce."
the
statute
also
makes
it
a
crime
to
accept
or
receive
money
or
thing
--
other
thing
of
value.
just
prior
to
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
district
court,
the
government
filed
a
memorandum
with
the
trial
judge
in
which
the
government
acknowledged.
what
is
the
fact
that
this
payment
and
delivery
to
beck
of
$200,000
was
made
to
him
as
a
loan.
the
district
court,
treating
the
memorandum
as
a
judicial
admission,
ruled
that
since
the
payment
and
delivery
and
the
receipt
and
acceptance
of
the
$200,000
were
on
a
loan
basis.
the
statue
was
not
violated
and
there
was
no
offense
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
is
from
this
ruling
of
the
district
court
that
this
appeal
is
prosecuted.
motions
to
affirm
were
made
in
this
court
at
the
early
brief
and
probable
jurisdiction
was
noted
on
october
10
of
last
year.
in
our
submission,
the
district
court
ruling
is
error.
the
plain
language
of
the
section
prohibits
any
payments
or
delivery
of
money
to
a
representative
of
employees
except
those
expressly
authorized.
the
purpose
and
the
context
of
the
section,
we
believe
accord
with
this
literal
meaning.
and
the
legislative
history
shows
the
intent
of
congress
to
prohibit
all
financial
dealings
except
those
specifically
authorized.
now,
i
will
expend
on
each
of
those
three
points
briefly
and
then
deal
whether
--
with
what
i
understand
to
be
the
two
principle
contentions
of
the
appellees
which
are
as
follows,
as
i
understand
them.
first,
the
appellees
contend
that
an
amendment
of
the
statute
in
1959,
in
the
kennedy
urbandale
--
urbandale
which
included
among
other
things
adding
the
term
"lend"
to
the
prohibitions
already
extant
against
paying
or
delivering
money.
evidence's,
congress'
own
understanding
that
the
statutory
prohibition
had
not
theretofore
included
alone,
and
then,
their
second
contention
as
i
understand
it
that
to
construe
the
statutory
prohibition
in
the
earlier
legislation
of
which
was
against
paying
or
delivering
money
as
including
a
prohibition
against
paying
or
delivering
on
loan,
would
deprive
the
accused
of
that
unequivocal
warning
which
every
criminal
statute
should
convey.
as
i
said,
i'll
--
the
converse
of
this
second
proposition
of
the
appellees
is
the
government's
first
point.
we
insist,
respectfully,
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
as
enacted
in
1947,
made
it
lawful
or
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
pay
or
deliver
"any
money
or
other
thing
of
value
to
a
representative
of
his
employees
as
well
as
the
receipt
or
acceptance
thereof
by
the
representative”.
now,
deliver,
which
is
the
term
of
the
statute
according
to
the
dictionary
meaning,
is
to
give
or
transfer.
receive.
again,
according
to
the
dictionary
meaning
is
to
take
something
that
is
offered.
as
we
see
it,
every
loan
contemplates
or
has
as
an
essential
element,
transfer,
delivery
and
acceptance
of
the
matter
alone.
when
an
employer
makes
a
loan
of
$200,000
to
a
representative,
he,
to
paraphrase
the
statute,
pays
or
delivers
money
to
the
representative
and
then
latter
receives
or
accepts
money
from
the
employer.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
i
would
say,
unquestionably
so,
mr.
justice
stewart,
without
any
question.
i
think
that
may
bear
on
the
subject
of
whether
this
was
in
other
thing
of
value
but
it
sees
the
position
of
the
government
that
the
payment
or
delivery
of
money
at
the
outset
was
a
square
violation
of
the
clear
provisions
of
the
statute
and
no
matter
what
the
interest
rate
might
be,
there
would
be
a
violation.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
think
we
must,
your
honor,
for
the
question
that
has
been
put
to
the
court
at
the
present
time.
the
--
the
jurisdictional
statement
makes
it
clear
that
it's
just
the
question
of
loan
and
i
think
that
your
honors
must
assume
that
it
was
a
bona
fide
loan
at
a
fair
rate
of
interest.
now,
there's
some
colloquy
in
the
record
which
is
before
your
honors
which
indicates
somewhat
to
the
contrary
but
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
defendants
that
i
must
say
that
the
question
that
was
put
before
this
court
is
a
bona
fide
loan.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
are
some
exceptions
in
the
statute
which
permit
certain
transactions.
i
believe
that
a
purchase
of
a
house
would
come
within
such
an
exception.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
believe
it
is
at
least
--
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
the
statue
is
set
out
but
not
all
portions
of
it
are
there.
but
my
judgment
would
be
that
that
would
come
within
one
of
these
sections
and
my
assistant
has
brought
to
my
attention
that
there
is
as
i
thought
such
an
exception
with
respect
to
the
sale
or
purchase
of
an
article
or
commodity
at
the
prevailing
market
price
in
the
regular
cost
of
business.
there
is
such
an
exception.
now
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
honestly
think
not.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
only
because
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
defense,
we
must
consider
the
question
as
it
was
put
to
the
court
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
which
was
squarely
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
loan
of
money
comes
within
the
foregoing
prohibitions.
and
i
think,
to
expand
the
question
as
we
outlined
it
to
your
honors
when
you
noted,
probable
jurisdiction
would
not
be
proper.
actually,
the
record
does
disclose
that
it
was
at
2%
and
that
there
were
certain
favors
conferred
with
regard
to
that.
but
i
feel
that
the
question
that
your
honors
must
address
yourself
squarely
to
with
regard
to
this
and
--
and
may
very
well
been
why
your
honors
thought
this
was
desirable
to
bring
up
and
to
--
or
at
least
to
consider
this
question,
was
this
matter
of
loan
as
such,
whether
it
comes
within
the
square
prohibitions
as
we
feel
it
does
of
this
statute.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
your
honor,
this
was
my
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
--
being
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
your
honor,
it
just
said
that
because
it
was
a
loan,
it
didn't
come
within
the
provisions.
the
--
the
--
it
was
an
oral
ruling
very,
very
brief
and
--
and
practically,
nothing
is
said
under
such.
i
might
say
that
another
district
court
has
held
that
the
loan
of
a
tugboat
for
24
hours
came
squarely
within
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
upheld
an
indictment
under
--
that's
in
the
northern
district
of
new
york.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
do
--
i
don't
think
so
on
this
record
and
i
think
in
fairness
to
the
defendants,
i
should
take
that
position
squarely,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
your
honor,
i
--
i
think
that
that
again,
i
don't
want
to
deprive
the
position
that
i'm
taking
of
every
advantage
possible
but
i
--
i
really
feel
that
the
question
that
led
your
honors
probably
to
consider
this
case
was
whether
or
not
a
loan,
assuming
it
was
a
bona
fide
loan,
came
within
the
prohibitions
of
this
--
of
this
statute.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
it
is
not
in
the
indictments,
your
honor
but
in
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
--
it
--
it
was
in
--
it
was
in
the
memorandum
of
law
which
was
filed
with
the
court
at
the
opening
of
the
trial
and
which
was
the
judicial
admission
which
the
district
court
said,
gave
rise
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
loan
and
which
led
the
court
under
the
circumstances
to
say,
"a
loan
does
not
come
within
the
prohibitions
of
the
statute."
i
think
i
can
point
that
out
to
you.
i
think,
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
page
12
and
13
of
the
record,
you
will
find
a
detailed
statement
of
what
was
in
the
brief.
and
you
will
find
at
the
bottom
of
page
13
on
the
right
that
only
4000
interest,
approximately
half
of
the
interest
due
which
was
4%,
so
there's
only
2%,
was
actually
paid
and
that
was
remitted
in
the
form
of
a
check
dated
may
3,
1950
from
--
1955
from
linda
who
was
beck's
attorney
to
seymour.
now,
i
think
that
is
probably
where
the
information
with
regard
to
the
2%
came
to
your
honors'
attention.
the
loan
was
set
up
at
4%
but
only
2%
was
in
fact
paid.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
it
does
not.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that
--
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
harlan.
well,
this
court
previously
on
both
the
ryan
case
and
the
arroyo
case
as
we
see
it
has
ascribed
their
literal
meaning
to
other
terms
used
in
section
302.
in
the
first
of
these
cases,
that
is
the
ryan
case,
the
court
concluded
as
your
honors
will
remember
that
the
term
in
the
statute
representative
of
employees
included
the
president
of
the
union
as
well
as
the
union
itself
even
though
by
contract,
the
union
was
turned
to
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
and
so
doing,
the
opinion
stated
as
the
statute
reads,
"it
appears
to
be
a
criminal
provision
malum
prohibitum,
which
outlaws
all
payments
with
stated
exceptions
between
the
employer
and
representative."
and
then
in
the
arroyo
case
which
of
course
followed
by
some
years,
the
ryan
case,
while
the
majority
of
the
court
held
against
the
government's
prosecution
by
deciding
that
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
prohibitions
of
this
section
had
been
precisely
followed.
the
opinion
noted
in
connection
with
the
statute
as
a
whole
that
a
literal
construction
of
this
statute
does
no
violence
to
common
sense.
now,
we
ask
no
other
consideration
here
than
that.
that
the
language
of
this
statute
be
followed
precisely
and
that
the
1454
delivery
of
this
money
as
the
first
step
in
this
loan,
fell
squarely
within
its
prohibitions.
as
of
course,
this
court
knows,
section
302
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
of
1947
was
enacted
as
a
part
of
a
comprehensive
revision
of
federal
labor
policy.
in
the
light
of
experience,
came
under
the
wagner
act
and
was
aimed
to
practices
which
congress
considered
destructive
of
the
integrity
of
collective
bargaining.
one
way
in
--
in
which
congress
sort
to
preserve
and
protect
that
integrity
was
by
outlawing
all
unauthorized
payments
between
employers
and
representatives
to
ensure
that
they
would
deal
at
arm's
length.
now,
a
loan
of
a
large
sum
of
money
can
be
just
as
corrosive
of
that
absolute
separateness
sought
by
congress
as
an
outright
gift.
indeed,
it
would
be
our
submission
that
the
obligation
of
the
representative
would
not
be
merely
that
of
one
who
has
behold
him
for
have
favored
about
him
as
in
the
case
of
a
gift.
but
if
the
loan
is
for
a
large
sum
of
money
and
is
on
demand
or
becomes
overdue,
it
places
the
borrower
at
the
absolute
mercy
of
the
employer.
boswell
in
the
light
of
johnson
had
this
to
say
and
i
think
it
fits
this
situation
rather
perfectly.
the
way
to
make
sure
of
power
and
influence
is
by
lending
money
confidentially
to
your
neighbors
at
a
small
interest
or
perhaps
no
interest
at
all
and
having
their
bonds
in
your
possession.
the
specific
language
of
302
was
intended
to
and
did
cover
any
delivery
or
receipt
of
money
that
might
cause
such
an
abuse.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
think
this
court
has
--
has
said
and
has
noted
the
fact,
your
honor
that
this
is
not
a
--
a
bribery
statute
in
that
sense
that
you
have
to
establish
that
two
weeks
before
you
are
going
into
negotiations,
you
came
around
and
slipped
something
under
the
table.
this
is
an
outright
prohibition
against
the
delivery
or
payment
of
money
at
any
time
or
other
thing
of
value
at
any
time.
it
does
not
have
to
be
shown
in
the
context
of
an
actual
transaction
as
between
the
representatives.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
possibly
so,
your
honor.
it
possibly
so
but
it
seems
to
me
the
prohibition
is
clear
there
regardless.
the
structure
of
302,
i
think
also
points
towards
the
same
construction.
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
which
we've
been
dealing
with
thus
far
are
the
broad
prohibitions.
the
exceptions
to
these
prohibitions
are
set
forth
in
(c),
and
these
exceptions
are
carefully
defined,
extremely
detailed
and
very
narrow.
i'm
not
going
to
take
your
honors'
time
now
to
go
through
them
but
when
you
look
at
those
exceptions,
you
will
see
very
clearly
that
the
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing
when
it
was
drafting
these
exceptions
and
that
it
gave
comparable
consideration
to
the
exceptions
it
wished
to
make.
and
that
it
accepted
only
those
things
which
would
be
free
from
abuse
like
a
purchase
and
sale
of
a
house,
the
checking
off
of
union
dues
with
written
authority
and
that
type
of
thing.
and
this
is
persuasive
evidence,
we
submit,
to
paraphrase
this
court's
opinion
in
the
bernanke
case,
the
wiretapping
case
that
had
congress
intended
to
allow
employers
to
pay
or
deliver
money
on
loan,
it
would
have
said
so.
but
not
only
the
literal
meaning
and
underlying
purpose
of
the
statute
but
the
legislative
history,
supports
the
government's
view
that
all
payments
or
deliveries
of
money,
whether
on
loan
or
otherwise,
were
intended
to
be
within
the
prohibitions.
almost
exactly
this
same
language
of
section
302
first
appeared
at
the
second
session
of
the
79th
congress
in
1946
when
senator
byrd
proposed
an
amendment
to
what
was
then
known
as
the
case
bill.
it
covered
almost
identically
what
we
have
here.
speaking
of
the
purpose
of
the
amendment,
senator
byrd
said,
"it
prohibits
the
employer
to
pay
for
any
representative
of
any
of
these
employees
to
collect
or
attempt
to
collect
any
money
or
other
thing
of
value
for
the
use
of
such
representative
or
in
trust
or
otherwise."
some
senators
were
concerned
over
the
broadness
of
the
proscriptions
particularly
senator
pepper
was
concerned.
and
he
argued
that
language
forbids
every
type
of
delivery
by
employer
to
employees
and
every
type
of
receipt
by
employees
from
employer
except
to
payment
of
compensation
for
services
rendered
and
the
so-called
checkoff.
senator
taft
who
was
also
a
strong
supporter
of
the
amendment
had
this
to
say.
"with
regard
to
the
very
wording,
i
assert
that
once
we
permit
an
agent
to
obtain
money
for
his
own
use
or
for
any
purpose,
it
is
affirmatively
a
dubious
practice,
an
immoral
practice
and
unless
it
is
used
for
purposes
which
are
properly
defined
by
law,
it
should
not
be
permitted."
now,
this
amendment
was
adopted
by
the
full
congress,
the
house
of
representatives
passed
it
and
then
the
president
vetoed
the
case
bill
and
it
failed
to
pass
over
his
veto.
they
went
back
the
next
year
and
went
to
work
on
this
again
and
similar
language
was
introduced
in
the
senate
committee.
a
majority
of
the
committee
reported
out
against
it
but
senator
taft
and
senator
ball
and
senator
smith
of
new
jersey
filed
a
minority
report,
brought
the
matter
up,
the
specific
language
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
in
1947
and
over
many
protestations,
the
section
302
was
passed
into
law.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
perhaps
that
--
perhaps
that
is
so,
your
honor
but
still,
i
think
the
language
is
clear
enough
that
--
that
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i'm
afraid,
you're
probably
right,
sir.
but
nowhere
in
the
course
of
the
history
of
section
302
is
that
it
would
be
from
any
indication
by
explicit
statement
or
implied
suggestion
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
forbid
every
sort
of
financial
transaction
except
those
authorized
between
the
employers
and
representatives
of
employees.
and
we
would
say
that
further
to
indicate
the
burden
of
the
intended
coverage
of
the
statute.
congress
went
beyond
simply
the
delivery
or
payment
of
money
when
they
prohibited
also
the
delivery
of
any
other
thing
of
value,
and
a
substantial
loan
of
money
which
i
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago,
qualifies
under
both
prohibitions
of
the
statue.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
there
are
five.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes,
there
are
five.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
would
think
not
sir,
except
that
--
that
--
i
would
say
that
in
a
--
in
the
case
of
every
one
of
them,
they
are
not
situations
where
they
could
be
the
subject
of
abuse
in
any
way.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
they're
not,
your
honor.
they
are
not
printed
in
the
brief.
they
are
very
long
and
quite
detailed
because
they
involve
the
matter
of
these
trust
funds
that
could
be
created
for
that
purpose.
now,
if
i
may
now
turn
to
the
appellees'
contention
that
because
302
was
amended
in
1959
to
include
the
words
among
others
"lend"
and
"loan",
this
evidence
is
a
view
on
the
part
of
congress.
that
previously,
a
payment
or
delivery
of
money
or
a
thing
of
value
on
loan
was
not
prohibited
by
the
clear
language
of
the
statue
itself
and
the
unequivocal
legislative
history.
the
1959
amendment
to
302
was
not
fashioned
and
cannot
be
reshaped
to
support
their
argument
as
we
see
it.
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
1959
amendment
shows
that
it
was
predominantly
concerned
with
getting
after
middlemen
and
agents,
the
so-called
labor
consultant
to
whom
the
money
might
be
given
and
then
he
might
pass
it
on
to
the
labor
--
or
to
the
representative
of
employees.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
to
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
there
was
no
reference
made
to
this
litigation
because
the
litigation
didn't
come
until
after
the
amendment.
the
--
the
amendment
came
following
the
transaction
that's
involved
heretofore.
the
committee
reporting
on
the
bill,
the
senate
committee
reporting
on
this
bill
in
1959
had
this
to
say,
"the
intent
of
these
amendments
is
to
forbid
any
payment
or
bribe
by
an
employer
or
anyone
who
acts
in
the
interest
of
an
employer
whether
technically
or
not
and
to
forbid
the
receipt
of
any
such
bribe
by
any
person
whether
an
individual,
an
officer
or
employee
of
a
labor
organization
or
a
committee
representing
employees."
now,
the
very
absence
of
any
reference
and
the
senate
committee
report
is
absolutely
silent,
there
is
no
reference
to
--
specifically
to
loans
or
lending
in
this
report,
the
senate
committee
report
or
to
their
being
a
noble
appendage
to
this
law.
i
think
it
indicates
that
the
legislation
was
designed
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
middlemen
and
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
it
was,
your
honor,
it
was.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
it
was
one
of
those
that
were
disclosed
before
the
mcclellan
committee.
that
is
correct.
now,
even
the
statement
of
the
author
of
the
bill,
senator
kennedy,
which
was
made
after
he
--
the
--
the
legislation
had
been
passed.
that
it
prohibits
loans
by
employers
or
unions
to
union
officers,
does
not
mean
that
the
1947
act
did
not
also
prohibit
the
payment
or
delivery
of
money
on
a
loan
basis.
it
think
to
--
to
suggest
that
the
words
"lend"
and
"loan"
crept
into
this
legislation
and
they
did
so
and
i
emphasize
this,
totally
without
comment
in
the
committee
reports
as
an
exaltation
to
prosecutors
to
go
after
what
was
already
prohibited
by
the
1947
act
but
which
actually
was
only
disclosed
in
these
mcclellan
hearings
which
led
to
these
amendments
regarding
labor
consultants
and
so
forth.
and
there
is
support
for
this
suggestion
in
this
part
of
the
committee
report
where
it
says,
"although
these
provisions
of
existing
law
would
punish
most
forms
of
bribery
or
extortion,
if
they
were
vigorously
enforced
by
prosecuting
officers."
the
testimony
before
the
mcclellan
committee
revealed
loopholes
which
both
employer
representatives
and
union
officials
turned
to
advantage
at
the
expense
of
employers
--
employees.
i
emphasize
again,
there's
nothing
in
the
report
with
regard
to
the
"lend"
and
"loan"
being
one
of
those
loopholes.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
think
not,
sir.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
no.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
no,
no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
now,
turning
to
the
second
contention
in
a
--
just
one
moment,
of
the
appellees
that
by
the
absence
of
the
words
"lend"
and
"loan"
from
the
earlier
act,
it
lacked
the
unequivocal
warning
to
which
an
accused
is
entitled.
this
brings
me
back
to
where
i
started.
we
have
seen
that
the
statute
clearly
states
that
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
an
employer
to
pay
or
deliver
money
to
a
representative
of
its
employees.
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
a
more
clear
expression
of
the
intent
of
the
congress
and
if
we
are
correct
that
a
payment
or
delivery
of
money
is
an
indispensable
part
of
a
loan.
and
i
submit
that
it
must
be,
then
appellees'
contention
comes
down,
it
seems
to
me,
to
that
out
of
the
traffic
violator
who
claims
that
because
he
backed
up
again,
across
an
intersection
after
he
went
through
a
red
light,
he
did
not
violate
the
ordinance
prohibiting
the
initial
transgression.
the
government
submits
that
the
ruling
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed
and
this
case
be
remanded
for
trial.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
think
that
language
is
--
is
very
clear
indeed.
thank
you.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well
perhaps
i'm
speaking
for
the
defendants
when
i
say,
i
think
it
should
be,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
--
i
mean
i
--
the
defendants
might
want
it.
there
might
be
issues
that
the
defendants
would
raise
that
i'm
not
familiar
with
in
a
moment
but
so
far
as
the
--
excuse
me.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
believe,
your
honor
there
are
no
other
defenses
that
could
be
raised.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
defense
in
this
regard.
i
don't
think
it's
quite
fair
for
me
to
do
so
but
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
believe
that
judge
sugarman
who
was
the
district
judge
who
made
this
ruling
felt
that
he
had
cleared
everything
else
out
of
the
way,
as
a
matter
of
law,
statute
of
limitations
and
various
other
considerations.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
stated.
i'm
not
stating
it
on
you.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
on
the
--
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
absolutely.
that
might
be
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
you
honor,
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court,
if
i
am
still
in
the
position
to
prosecute
it
at
that
time.
it
would
be
my
intention
in
trying
the
case
to
set
out
the
facts
of
the
loan
just
as
we
understand
those
facts
to
be.
our
position
would
be,
however,
that
this
was
a
loan.
that
is
the
basis
on
which
we're
before
this
court
and
we
would
proceed
on
that
basis.
now,
if
the
--
if
there
is
denial
in
any
form
of
the
receipt
of
this
loan
or
anything
of
that
sort,
i
suppose
it's
within
the
power
of
the
jury
to
determine
the
facts
and
that
that
would
include
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
all
the
surrounding
facts
with
regard
to
this
transaction.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
your
honor,
i
feel
in
fairness.
the
reason
that
i
stick
to
that
in
this
court
is
that
i
feel
that
is
the
basis
on
which
your
honors
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
right.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
--
that
was
the
representation
that
the
government
made,
your
honor.
that
i
feel
at
the
time
that
we
--
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
therefore,
i
didn't
think
it
was
proper
to
go
beyond
that
on
this
(voice
overlap).
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
think
we
should,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
would
say
that
when
we
came
to
try
the
case,
we
could
put
all
of
the
facts
before
the
jury.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
absolutely.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
my
--
quite
correct,
your
honor
and
of
course
the
defense
that
may
go
in
may
call
for
certain
rebuttal
testimony.
we
just
don't
know
where
it
would
be.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
--
i
believe
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
thought
that
we
were
bound
by
what
we
have
stated
as
the
question
presented
here
which
is
on
page
2
of
this
jurisdictional
statement
and
i
felt
in
fairness
to
the
defendants
that
we
shouldn't
go
beyond
that
in
trying
to
urge,
your
honors
to
come
to
--
i
felt
we
were
bound
by
that
--
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
your
honor
that
of
course
is
the
judicial
admission
with
which
we
were
charged
in
the
district
court.
that
statement
which
is
of
course
is
on
the
record
but
i
feel
that
--
that
your
honors,
in
coming
to
your
conclusion
with
regard
to
this
are
bound
to
consider
this
as
a
bona
fide
loan
and
--
and
that
that
is
the
question
that's
before
the
court.
thank
you.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
i
just
think
that's
so
as
--
as
well,
exactly.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
well,
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stated
exactly
what
our
position
would
be,
mr.
chief
justice
that
what
we
would
do
is
to
present
the
facts.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
right,
right.
but
we
would
present
the
facts
[laughs],
we
would
present
the
facts,
your
honor
and
take
that
position.
mr.
s.
hazard
gillespie,
jr.
thank
you.
