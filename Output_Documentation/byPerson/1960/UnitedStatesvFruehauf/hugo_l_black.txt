and
they're
not
printed
in
your
brief,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
sent
back
for
trial
with
the
only
case
that
would
be
tried
whether
this
loan
has
been
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
the
defenses,
do
you
think
could
be
raised
under
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
sole
question
would
be
whether
you
made
a
loan
that
would
represent
the
employee
of
its
employer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
--
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
of
course,
i
didn't
mean
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
on
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
position
is
that
making
the
loan
even
though
bona
fide,
backed
up
by
mortgage
or
anything
else,
would
violate
the
act.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
do
that
then
when
we
go
down
and
try
it
again
and
you
weren't
here,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
it's
called
in
faith,
it
would
be
admitted
to
be
a
bona
fide
because
our
opinion
would
be
based
upon
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
nizer.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
too
about
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked.
the
government
stated
for
the
court
here,
that
its
position
was
two-fold.
first
is,
its
indictment
simply
charge
the
violation
of
statute
frankly
in
the
word
statute,
which
is
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
actually
--
but
they
did
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
language
of
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
mr.
guzzetta,
who
was
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
said,
“what
i
tried
to
indicate
was
that
the
government's
position
is
two-fold
if
it
wasn't
a
loan,
the
juries
determinate
--
determine
on
the
basis
to
the
facts
which
they
hear
that
this
was
the
outer
clothing,
fabricated
by
one
highly
complex
intercorporate
transaction,
didn't
make
this
transfer
a
loan,
clearly,
it
would
come
within
the
statute."
then
he
says,
"there
would
be
no
problem
in
my
mind
at
all.
secondly,
if
the
jury
decided
it
was
a
loan,
i
wouldn't
say
that
that
would
preclude
them
from
finding
a
verdict
of
guilty.”
now,
if
--
if
the
question
is
whether
the
indictment
is
passed
because
it
didn't
say
or
described
it
more
definitely
but
it
happened,
that
could
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
why?
that
we
have
to
pass
on
this
case
on
the
basis
that
it
was
a
genuine
bona
fide
loan
when
the
question
was
raised
the
other
way
and
when
the
--
indictment
didn't
charge
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
couldn't
--
they
did
not
amend
the
indictment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
they
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
it
comes
to
us
and
we
find
that
there's
another
issue
with
reference
to
the
construction.
and
the
indictment
charges
something
which
might
be
proven
to
the
issue.
your
legal
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
a
bona
fide
loan
would
violate
the
law
as
one
but
there
is
still
the
question
that
i'm
--
is
this
court
bound
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
you
will
ignore
the
fact
that
the
indictment
charge
more
than
the
government
is
saying
here
or
arguing
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
have
a
duty
to
send
it
back
there,
would
it
not,
if
there
were
before
us,
the
issue
of
construction,
even
though
we
had
taken
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
a
question
of
fact.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
not
what
the
grand
jury
charged.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
to
another
question
then.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
read
this
record,
at
the
very
time
judge
sugarman
handed
down
his
opinion
claiming
if
the
government
had
waived
this,
the
government's
counsel
claiming
it
hadn't
waived
it.
it
said,
"you
are
picking
out
a
statement
of
the
first
two
or
three
pages
of
the
brief
written
by
the
assistant
prosecuting
attorney
trying
to
hold
the
government
bound
by
that."
and
then
he
explained
that
link
that
this
indictment
charged
more
than
the
judge
was
holding
him
down
to.
and
did
not
--
what
--
what
authority
did
the
judge
have
to
bind
the
government
at
the
very
time
it
was
saying,
"we
don't
waive
any
such
things."
justice
hugo
l.
black
"we
want
to
try
this
case
on
the
issues
that
if
it's
a
loan."
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
read
page
34.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
to
that
--
that's
arguing
the
facts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
talking
about
is
this
argument
of
mr.
guzzetta
on
page
34
on
this
motion
to
dismiss
while
you
were
taking
the
position
that
the
government
waived.
mr.
guzzetta
said,
"we
didn't
waived.we
are
not
waiving."
and
the
court
went
ahead
and
held
that
the
government
had
waived
it
anyhow
and
deprived
them
of
the
right
to
try
the
issue
raised
by
the
indictment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
facts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
said
there
were
two
--
there
was
a
two-fold
case
there.
one
of
them
was
with
reference
to
the
loan
to
which
you
referred
to
certain
facts
as
--
as
a
loan.
the
other
one
was
that
we
are
also
proceeding
on
the
basis
that
it
was
not
a
loan
and
in
fact
it
was
a
bogus
loan.
that
--
that
was
his
argument
to
the
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
judge
told
him
and
said,
"you
have
waived
it
in
your
original
brief,
the
first
three
pages
of
it."
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
--
that
wouldn't
keep
it
from
--
necessarily.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
--
yes,
but
that
wouldn't
necessarily
keep
it
from
being
a
bogus
loan.
