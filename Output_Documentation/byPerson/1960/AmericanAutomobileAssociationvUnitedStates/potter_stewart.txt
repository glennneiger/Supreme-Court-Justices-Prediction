they
would
lose
--
they
would
lose
in
the
year
the
gears
were
shifted,
wouldn't
it?
it
would
--
it
would
lose
in
the
year
of
transition,
in
other
words,
of
changing
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
there
is
not.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
--
there's
now
a
statue
--
there's
now
a
statute
specifically
covering
subscriptions,
isn't
there?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
--
isn't
it
true
that
one
of
the
things
that
452
or
--
and/or
462
did
was
to
allow
taxpayers
to
shift
their
method
of
accounting
without
permission
of
the
commissioner.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
where
the
rub
came
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
where
the
transitional
loss
came
in.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
can
you
give
us
an
example
of
what
you
have
in
mind?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
just,
in
other
words,
ordinary
accrual
accounting.
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
about
the
--
is
it
your
position
that
--
as
indicated
on
page
20
of
your
brief
that,
“an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
has
to
report
an
item
as
gross
income
no
later
than
the
year
of
actual
payment.”
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
of
it
is
of
course
the
magazine
subscriptions.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
has
--
section
22
doesn't
say
any
by
plaintiffs.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
mr.
oberdorfer,
we're
talking
about
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer
and
i
would
doubt
very
much
that
many
people
go
to
a
barber
shop
and
say,
“now,
let
me
pay
you
$50
and
you
take
care
of
all
my
haircut
and
shaving
needs
for
1961."
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that's
--
no,
not
--
now,
we're
talking
about
a
credit
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
precise
is
the
--
is
the
prediction
of
the
costs
of
these
memberships?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
seem
(voice
overlap)
with
this.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
--
the
amount
of
the
accuracy
of
the
--
of
an
insurance
company
is
actuarial
experience.
justice
potter
stewart
i
assume
that's
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
that
--
assuming
the
taxicab
driver
wanted
to
be
on
accrual
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
