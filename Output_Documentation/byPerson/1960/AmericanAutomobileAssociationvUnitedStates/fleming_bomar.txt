mr.
fleming
bomar
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
federal
income
tax
case.
it
is
before
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
claims
which
dismissed
petitioner's
suit.
petitioner
is
the
american
automobile
association,
a
nonstock
membership
corporation
with
its
principal
offices
in
the
district
of
columbia.
petitioner
is
a
national
organization
which
renders
services
to
its
affiliated
local
clubs
and
their
members
and
performs
services
of
a
public
nature
and
fields
relating
to
motoring
and
travel.
separate
books
and
records
are
maintained
by
petitioner
with
respect
to
its
national
activities
and
those
activities
are
not
involved
in
this
proceeding.
in
addition,
petitioner
operates
directly
10
local
automobile
clubs
as
divisions
of
the
corporation.
those
clubs
include
the
club
which
serves
the
metropolitan
area
of
washington,
a
club
which
serves
south
florida,
went
in
texas,
wisconsin,
wyoming
and
so
forth.
substantially,
all
of
the
income
which
petitioner
derives
from
its
divisions
is
paid
in
the
form
of
dues
prepaid
by
its
members
in
advance,
in
consideration
for
services
to
be
rendered
by
the
club
over
the
ensuing
12-month
period.
petitioner
is
obligated
to
render
services
over
that
ensuing
12-month
period
which
include
a
complete
travel
service,
trip
planning,
tour
books,
accommodation
directories,
maps,
emergency
road
service,
personal
automobile
accident
insurance,
bail
bond
protection.
the
obligation
of
petitioner
necessarily
includes
the
duty
to
maintain
the
staff
and
the
facilities
in
--
which
are
adequate
to
permit
it
to
perform.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
petitioner
in
computing
its
income
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
can
account
for
prepaid
dues
as
taxable
income
in
accordance
with
sound
principles
of
accrual
accounting.
or
whether
this
court,
in
automobile
club
of
michigan,
intended
to
lay
down
a
broad
general
rule
of
law
that
under
no
circumstances
can
prepaid
receipts,
be
accounted
for
as
taxable
income
later
than
the
year
in
which
received.
and
regardless
of
sound
accounting
--
accounting
principles
and
irrespective
of
whether
net
income
is
clearly
reflected,
petitioner's
entire
argument
will
be
directed
toward
establishing
the
point
that
this
court
did
not
intend
to
lay
down
such
a
broad
sweeping
rule
law
in
automobile
club
of
michigan
on
the
accounting
issue.
and
that
therefore,
the
michigan
case
should
not
be
controlling
here.
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes,
sir.
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes,
sir.
i
will
cover
it.
mr.
fleming
bomar
he
does.
on
page
20
of
his
brief.
mr.
fleming
bomar
the
commissioner
volunteers
the
definition
of
accrual
accounting
which
says
never
later
than
the
year
of
receipt.
petitioner
isn't
accrual
basis
tax
payer.
it
falls
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
inso
--
in
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
it
should
not
over
the
long
run.
it
should
not
except
that
where
the
government
collects
money
in
advance
of
performance,
it
gets
its
money
too
soon
and
on
--
and
it
gets
its
money
on
earning
--
on
what
is
not
income.
mr.
fleming
bomar
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
fleming
bomar
there
is
no
transition
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
no.
if
taxpayers
were
permitted
to
switchover,
there
would
--
there
could
be
a
reduction
in
income
in
the
year
of
the
changeover.
mr.
fleming
bomar
but
a
change
can
be
made
only
with
the
approval
of
the
commissioner
and
under
such
conditions
as
he
specifies.
mr.
fleming
bomar
only
if
income
is
clearly
reflected
and
if
necessary
in
order
to
match
prepaid
income
with
related
cause,
then
it
should
be
permitted.
mr.
fleming
bomar
but
not
every
circumstance.
mr.
fleming
bomar
there
is
sound
accounting
principles,
yes.
mr.
fleming
bomar
if
income
is
clearly
reflected.
mr.
fleming
bomar
if
you
compute
income
accurately,
yes,
sir,
to
determine
what
is
net
income.
now,
if
there
are
no
--
if
there
are
no
cost
to
be
matched,
there
maybe
no
reason
to
defer
even
though
accountants
may
recommend
deferral.
but
the
problem
is
acute
and
certainly,
this
court
should
hold
that
in
any
case
where
it
is
absolutely
essential
in
order
to
match
the
cost
of
performance
with
the
prepaid
revenue
that
you've
got
to
defer.
now,
the
years
involved
in
this
dispute,
the
calendar
years
1952,
1953
and
1954,
the
taxes
in
dispute,
total
$207,000
plus
interest.
while
petitioner
filed
its
tax
returns
on
a
calendar
year
basis,
its
members
join
in
prepaid
dues
for
12-month
period
which
does
not
coincide
with
petitioner's
calendar
year
or
taxable
year
but
extends
beyond
in
every
case.
in
every
case,
the
membership
period
extends
beyond
the
petitioner's
taxable
year.
that
single
fact
is
the
cause
of
the
dispute
and
because
of
that
fact,
petitioner's
method
of
accounting
is
as
follows.
a
member
joins
on
july
1,
prepays
dues
of
$12.
under
petitioner's
method
of
accounting,
$6
of
those
prepaid
dues
are
reflected
as
income
in
the
year
of
receipt,
the
remaining
$6
--
the
following
year.
respondent
says
no,
in
tactual
of
dollars,
constitutes
taxable
income
in
the
year
of
receipts.
the
difference
in
the
two
methods
of
accounting
is
best
understood
if
we
assume
that
cost
of
serving
a
member
are
$1
per
member
per
month,
in
other
words,
an
exact
breakeven
situation.
in
--
under
our
method
of
accounting,
if
a
member
joins
july
1,
we
have
$6
of
income,
$6
of
cost
in
the
year
the
member
joins,
no
profit.
the
following
year,
we
also
have
$6
of
income,
$6
of
cost,
no
profit.
under
the
respondent's
method
where
a
member
joins
july
1,
we've
got
$12
of
income,
only
$6
of
cost
and
a
fictitious
profit
of
$6.
the
situation
is
most
appalling
when
the
members
joined
in
december
and
our
members
--
just
as
many
joined
in
december
as
in
the
other
month,
under
respondent's
method
of
accounting,
$12
of
income
in
december.
we've
incurred
only
$1
of
cost
in
serving
the
member
so
we're
required
to
pay
a
tax
on
a
fictitious
profit
of
$11.
now,
petitioner
has
established
this
effect
in
this
case,
not
that
its
cost
a
$1
per
member
per
month
but
that
--
its
costs
are
substantially
in
proportion
to
membership
from
month-to-month
with
reasonable
constancy
from
year-to-year.
the
exact
cost
per
member
per
month,
are
shown
in
the
record
on
pages
70
and
71
and
they
are
quite
uniform
per
member
per
month.
petitioner
in
its
case
in
the
lower
court
went
further
than
that
and
established
as
a
fact
that
there
is
a
precise
matching
of
income
and
related
cost
in
the
same
taxable
year.
finding
of
fact
26
is
to
the
effect
that
if
our
advanced
dues
were
recognized
as
income
exactly
as
costs
were
incurred,
the
net
income
during
the
years
in
issue
would
be
substantially
the
same
as
that
reported
by
petitioner
on
its
tax
returns.
now,
despite
those
findings
of
fact,
the
court
of
claims
felt
and
held
that
it
was
precluded
from
rendering
a
decision
in
favor
of
petitioner
because
this
court,
in
automobile
club
of
michigan,
apparently
intended
to
lay
down
a
rule
of
law
that
such
a
method
of
accounting
as
--
as
followed
by
petitioner
is
unacceptable
for
tax
purposes.
in
view
of
the
position
that
the
respondent
takes
in
this
case
arguing
that
we
violate
the
annual
accounting
requirements,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
at
this
point.
under
our
method
of
accounting,
we
do
not
wait
the
termination
of
a
membership
to
determine
whether
a
profit
or
loss
is
earned
on
the
membership.
instead,
as
of
the
end
of
the
calendar
year,
we
determine
the
profit
and
loss
by
reference
to
that
portion
of
the
contract
which
has
expired
within
the
calendar
year.
petitioner
submits
that
its
method
of
accounting
should
be
and
is
acceptable
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
because
it
complies
with
the
applicable
statutes,
complies
with
the
commissioner's
own
regulations
and
is
in
conformity
with
the
principles
of
accrual
accounting
laid
down
by
this
court
under
section
446
(a).
the
statute
not
only
permits
but
requires
a
taxpayer
to
file
its
federal
income
tax
returns
in
accordance
with
the
method
of
accounting
employed
in
keeping
its
books
and
records.
and
the
only
two
exceptions,
446
(b)
state's
them.
if
no
method
of
accounting
is
regularly
employed
or
if
the
method
of
accounting
fails
to
reflect
income
clearly
then
the
commissioner
can
substitute
his
own
judgment
and
his
own
method.
but
neither
of
those
exceptions
are
applicable
in
this
case.
under
section
446
(c)
of
the
code,
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
is
expressly
authorized
by
the
statute.
section
451
which
is
entitled
general
rule
with
respect
to
year
of
inclusion
of
an
item
of
gross
income
spells
out
that
while
in
general,
an
item
of
gross
income
should
be
included
in
taxable
income
in
the
year
received,
it
spells
out
the
exception
unless
under
the
method
of
accounting
employed
by
the
taxpayer,
it
is
properly
accounted
for
as
of
a
different
period.
certainly,
a
different
period
can
be
a
period
either
before
or
after
the
year
of
receipt.
that
is
an
express
statutory
authorization
of
accounting
for
prepaid
receipts
and
a
yet
different
from
the
year
of
receipt.
the
commissioner's
regulations
have
for
many,
many
years
stated,
“approved
standard
methods
of
accounting
are
acceptable
for
federal
income
tax
purposes
as
a
general
rule.”
that
is
the
statement
in
the
1939
code.
under
the
1954
code,
a
statement
which
says,
the
commissioner's
own
regulations,
a
method
of
accounting
which
reflects
the
consistent
application
of
generally
accepted
accounting
principles
were
ordinary
--
ordinarily
be
regarded
as
clearly
reflecting
income
and
therefore
acceptable
for
federal
income
tax
purposes.
finding
22
--
finding
of
fact
22
in
this
case
which
is
in
the
record
on
page
66
is
to
the
effect
that
our
method
of
accounting
does
conform
with
established
accounting
principles.
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
accrual
accounting
with
the
possible
exception
of
michigan
clearly
support
petitioner's
position
as
early
as
united
states
v.
anderson,
which
is
in
269
u.s.
and
was
decided
in
1926,
this
court
explained
the
purpose
of
accrual
accounting
in
the
following
language
after
reviewing
carefully
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
authorizing
a
taxpayer
to
use
accrual
accounting.
said
this
court,
“if
the
purpose
of
accrual
accounting
is
to
enable
taxpayers
to
keep
their
books
and
records
and
to
file
their
tax
returns
according
to
scientific
accounting
principles
by
charging
against
income
earned
during
the
taxable
period,
the
expenses
incurred
in
and
properly
attributable
to
the
process
of
earning
income
during
that
period.”
now,
the
finding
of
fact
in
our
case
conforms
exactly
with
that
language
since
it
is
found
as
a
fact
that
there
is
a
precise
match
of
prepaid
dues
and
related
cost
of
serving
members.
second,
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
spring
city
foundry
which
is
in
292
u.s.
to
the
recent
hanson
decision,
point
out
that
it
is
not
the
time
of
the
actual
receipt
of
cash
that
determines
the
year
of
its
inclusion
in
income
under
accrual
accounting.
and
the
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court
on
the
subject
of
accrual
accounting,
cash
generally
has
been
received
by
the
taxpayer
in
a
year
following
that
in
which
performance
takes
place.
in
our
case,
cash
is
received
prior
to
performance.
the
rules
of
accrual
accounting
are
exactly
the
same
whether
or
not
cash
precedes
or
follows
performance.
in
accordance
with
sound
accounting
principles,
income
under
accrual
accounting
emerges
only
as
goods
to
deliver
or
a
services
rendered.
now,
what
goes
on
line
one
of
an
income
statement
is
the
value
of
goods
delivered
or
the
value
of
services
rendered,
cash
is
ignored
whether
it
comes
into
play
before
or
after
performance.
there
are
two
interesting
decisions
precisely
in
point
of
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
have
followed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
automobile
club
of
michigan.
first
is
the
bressner
radio
case
which
was
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
case
involved
prepaid
television
service
contracts.
the
contract
which
--
a
purchase
of
a
television
set
would
buy
at
the
time
he
bought
his
set
was
to
have
the
seller
guarantee
the
fixer
set
over
the
ensuing
12-month
period.
these
were
in
the
days
when
sets
were
a
little
more
fickle
than
they
are
today.
the
contract
was
exactly
for
12
months,
the
same
as
in
our
case.
the
taxpayer's
obligation
to
perform
in
that
case
was
only
upon
the
demand
of
the
member
which
is
exactly
the
same
as
in
our
case,
the
method
of
accounting
followed
by
the
taxpayers
in
the
bressner
case,
substantially
the
same
as
in
our
case.
the
prepaid
television
service
contract
income
was
prorated
over
the
period
of
the
contract.
the
second
circuit
reviewed
in
detail
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
the
subject
of
accrual
accounting
and
can
--
and
concluded
that
this
court
in
michigan
inferred
that
a
realistic
deferral
would
have
been
permissible
for
tax
purposes
if
income
were
clearly
reflected.
the
starting
points,
said
the
court,
was
whether
income
was
clearly
reflected
and
it
looked
at
all
of
these
contracts,
found
a
uniform
cost
on
a
monthly
basis
and
conclude
that
it
was
absolutely
essential
for
the
taxpayer
to
employ
sound
accrual
accounting
in
order
to
reflect
its
income
clearly.
actually,
the
taxpayer
was
(inaudible)
in
a
loss
but
the
government
was
trying
to
collect
an
income
tax
because
under
its
method
of
accounting
of
profit
was
shown.
the
eighth
circuit
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
michigan
has
decided
schlude
case
which
involves
prepaid
income
received
by
dance
studios
in
return
for
lessons
to
be
given
over
more
than
a
period
of
one
year.
the
eighth
circuit
followed
the
second
circuit,
said,
“clearly,
sound
accrual
accounting
demands
that
prepaid
receipts
not
be
taken
into
income
until
the
cost
to
incur
of
serving
the
member."
the
beacon
publish
company
case
in
the
tenth
circuit,
involved
exactly
the
same
issue
insofar
as
prepaid
subscription
income
was
concerned.
that
case
was
decided
before
this
court's
decision
in
michigan
and
this
court
in
a
footnote
in
the
michigan's
case,
said
it
was
not
really
passing
upon
the
principle
laid
down
in
the
beacon
case.
mr.
fleming
bomar
there
is
now.
but
this
was
decided
independently
of
that
statute
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
--
the
beacon
case.
sections
4
--
your
honor,
insofar
as
452
and
462
are
concerned,
the
--
they
were
enacted
in
an
endeavor
to
eliminate
a
lot
of
the
wrangling
which
has
gone
on
in
the
lower
courts
in
this
area.
the
losses
and
revenue
that
would
have
resulted
from
the
enactment
of
those
statutes
occurred
in
the
year
of
transition
of
a
method
of
accounting.
there
is
no
transitional
problem
involved
in
this
case
where
the
petitioner
has
consistently
used
the
same
method
of
accounting
for
31
years
even
before
and
after
it
was
taxable.
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
in
urging
congress
to
repeal
sections
452
and
462,
expressly
promised
that
no
inferences
whatever
be
drawn
by
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
or
by
the
department
of
justice
from
the
enactment
in
repeal
of
that
legislation.
despite
those
assurances,
a
great
deal
of
the
defendant's
brief
here
is
devoted
to
making
just
such
inferences.
i
think
the
problem
is
expressly
answered
by
the
second
circuit
in
the
bressner
case
where
the
second
circuit
reviewed
it
and
simply
said
it
had
no
barring
upon
the
disposition
of
this
legally
or
otherwise.
mr.
fleming
bomar
452
and
462
(voice
overlap)
of
the
statute.
mr.
fleming
bomar
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
the
ways
and
means
committee
and
the
senate
finance
committee
both
stated
that
it
was
to
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
law
as
it
existed
prior
to
the
enactment
in
repeal
and
even
expressly
referred
to
beacon
publishing
company
and
said,
“where
clearly
not
--
nothing
in
repeal
of
this
legislation
shall
have
any
adverse
effect
on
that
case.”
so
the
principle
in
that
case
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes,
sir.
mr.
fleming
bomar
it
did.
it
allowed
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
and
that's
where
the
loss
came
out.
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes.
mr.
fleming
bomar
furthermore,
those
statutes,
section
452
and
462
were
drafted
in
very
general
terminology
that
that
is
--
did
not
identify
the
type
of
prepaid
income
that
they
were
talking
about
and
a
lots
of
claims
were
being
made
by
taxpayers
because
of
the
generality
of
the
statutes
which
would
not
be
authorized
under
sound
accounting
principles.
it
was
a
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes.
that
point
was
argued
before
the
court
in
the
michigan
case.
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes.
mr.
fleming
bomar
on
452
and
462
and
appears
in
both
briefs
there.
in
concluding,
since
i
want
to
reserve
some
rebuttal
time,
since
our
method
of
accounting
clearly
conforms
with
generally
accepted
in
accounting
principles,
complies
with
the
express
statutory
provisions.
and
in
one
of
the
few
cases
have
had
where
complies
with
the
commissioner's
very
own
regulations,
we
respectfully
submit
that
if
the
commissioner
seeks
to
force
us
to
change
from
a
method
of
accounting
which
clearly
reflects
income
to
one
which
does
not,
he
has
exceeded
the
permissible
limits
of
his
discretionary
authority
and
we,
therefore,
respectfully
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
fleming
bomar
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
petitioner
is
obligated
to
render
services
to
its
members
over
the
ensuing
12-month
period.
how
our
petition,
paragraph
4,
alleges
that
obligation,
that's
record,
page
2.
record
page
7,
the
government
concedes
it
so
there's
no
doubt
about
the
liability
that
we
have
to
render
services.
if
we
don't
--
if
we
refuse,
clearly,
a
member
could
get
his
money
back.
you're
not
involved
with
much
money
so
undoubtedly,
we
don't
get
suits
on
that
score
often
but
they
would
legally
be
entitled
to
it.
second,
insofar
as
the
confusion
that
is
in
--
in
the
government's
brief
from
the
point
of
view
of
equating
the
--
the
problem
of
deductions
with
the
problem
of
prepaid
income,
it
helps
to
clarify
my
thinking
if
--
i
referred
to
the
example
of
an
individual
who
orders
a
custom-built
car.
the
maker
says
to
him,
“the
cost
is
$10,000.
since
it's
custom
built,
pay
me
now
but
i
won't
be
--
i
can't
make
it
until
next
year
and
i
cannot
deliver
it
until
next
year.”
this
court
has
never
decided
the
deductibility
or
--
of
a
reserve
for
estimated
expenses
where
prepaid
receipts
are
involved.
certainly,
in
that
case,
if
the
cost
of
making
the
car
was
$9000,
either
in
accordance
with
sound
accounting
principle,
the
maker
must
set
up
a
liability
account
for
the
advance
and
then
take
that
money
into
come
when
the
car
is
delivered.or
he
must
guess
at
what
the
cost
of
producing
it
is
going
to
be.
one
of
the
other
two
procedures
is
essential
since
the
only
off
in
it
is
what
the
government
contends
for
that
the
entire
$10,000
is
taxable
income.
and
when
the
government
contends
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
code
with
respect
to
earning
--
with
earned
income,
it's
a
horrendous
thought
to
think
that
income
taxes
are
going
to
be
computed
on
something
other
than
net
income.
the
methods
of
accounting,
the
provisions
of
the
code
with
respect
to
methods
of
accounting
are
inserted
in
the
code
to
be
certain
that
only
net
income
is
taxed.
the
choice
of
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
is
given
to
a
taxpayer
to
permit
a
precise
computation
of
net
income
rather
than
having
to
compute
income
on
a
cash
receipts
and
disbursements
method.
mr.
fleming
bomar
quite
accurate.
in
--
they
have
a
point
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
pretty
close.
mr.
fleming
bomar
in
the
years
involved,
the
cost
of
serving
one
member
for
a
12-month
period
was
something
like
$14.50
one
year
and
$14.61
the
next.
the
budget
committee
can
estimate
with
precise
accuracy.
in
other
words,
with
--
and
as
close
as
10
cents
per
member
per
year,
what
the
average
cost
of
serving
a
member
over
any
12-month
period
will
be.
mr.
fleming
bomar
generally
speaking,
if
the
principles
of
accrual
accounting
aren't
followed,
the
--
mr.
oberdorfer
is
paying
for
10
taxicabs
rides
in
advance
of
performance.
the
taxicab
driver
would
report
1/10th
his
income
as
each
trip
was
made
and
if
some
trips
were
made
the
following
taxable
year,
the
entire
prepayment
would
not
be
included
an
income
until
the
following
taxable
year.
mr.
fleming
bomar
was
an
accrual-basis
taxpayer.
mr.
fleming
bomar
otherwise,
you're
taxing
an
advance
as
“net
income”
when
it's
not
income
at
all,
it's
simply
an
advance
like
a
loan
from
a
bank.
it's
an
advance
from
a
customer.
it
is
a
borrowing
from
a
customer
when
you
obtain
money
in
advance
of
performing
what
the
money
was
paid
for.
and
there's
no
difference
in
principle
between
where
goods
are
being
delivered
or
where
services
of
being
rendered
so
long
as
the
deferral
in
essential
in
order
to
match
cost
with
related
revenue.
there
is
no
difficulty
of
administration
involved
if
advances
are
not
taken
into
income
at
the
moment
of
--
of
receipt.
they
are
taken
into
income
as
goods
are
delivered
or
if
services
are
rendered.
and
that's
the
way
every
accrual
accounting
tax
return
is
made
out.
that's
standard
practice
in
all
of
the
accrual
accounting
tax
returns
that
are
in
existence
today.
that
it
isn't
difficult
to
identify
performance.counsel
doesn't
worry
about
violating
annual
accounting
rules
when
cash
comes
in
a
year
following
performance
if
the
sale
has
been
made
or
if
the
goods
had
been
delivered.
the
respondent
properly
argues
that
the
income
is
earned
and
the
tax
payers
got
to
pay
his
tax
whether
or
not
he
has
received
the
cash.
well,
if
that
doesn't
violate
the
annual
accounting
principle,
it
doesn't
violate
it
to
get
the
money
in
advance
of
performance
and
not
report
it
as
taxable
income
until
performance
takes
place.
so
the
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
in
every
case.
mr.
fleming
bomar
in
every
case
since
the
member
prepays
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
--
for
a
12
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
no,
sir.
substantially,
all
of
our
gross
income
is
prepaid
receipts
and
that
is
the
reason
the
problem
is
difficult
in
our
sir.
it's
hard
to
find
this
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
there
should
be
no
loss
of
revenue
to
the
government
in
the
long
run
if
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
there's
no
gain
to
the
--
there's
a
tremendous
gain
to
the
association
in
the
sense
that
we
only
have
to
pay
net
income
--
income
taxes
on
what's
net
income
and
we
don't
have
--
i
mean,
take
the
case
of
the
december
member
again,
if
you've
got
to
pay
an
income
tax
on
$11
out
of
$12
of
advance
dues,
you
don't
have
money
enough
leftover
after
52%
tax
with
which
to
pay
the
cost
in
the
following
year
of
serving
the
member,
so
it
makes
a
tremendous
difference
to
it.
we
would
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes.
mr.
fleming
bomar
it
makes
this
difference.
to
a
club
that's
growing,
you're
paying
taxes
in
advance
of
earning
a
profit
and
you're
paying
taxes
on
a
substantially
higher
figure
than
your
accountants
tell
you
is
net
income.
mr.
fleming
bomar
then
you
level
out
--
then
when
you
level
out,
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
which
you
never
pick
up
what
you
have
prepaid
to
the
government
on
something
that's
not
income
and
it
never
evens
out
--
mr.
fleming
bomar
when
in
the
years
when
the
membership
declines,
you
finally
are
correcting
the
inequity
to
the
extent
of
the
decline
and
the
inequity
is
not
finally
washed
out
until
the
last
member
leaves
the
club.
mr.
fleming
bomar
well,
we
are
--
we
tempt
to
break
even
obviously
but
sometimes
it
--
when
you
don't
know
how
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
your
income
taxes
for
example,
you
may
have
charged
enough
to
--
[laughter]
mr.
fleming
bomar
it
is
a
membership.
mr.
fleming
bomar
it
is
a
membership
association.
mr.
fleming
bomar
and
the
members
would
get
the
benefit
of
it.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
charter
which
restricts
reimbursements
to
members,
refunds
to
the
members?
mr.
fleming
bomar
yes,
they
get
refunds
in
all
proper
cases
asides
when
member
dies
or
he
moves
to
another
city,
a
refund
is
made.
there
is
no
automatic
right
to
claim
a
refund
because
you
use
the
services
of
the
club
for
example
for
six
months
and
decides
you
don't
want
to
use
it
for
no
good
reason,
the
next
six
months
and
ask
if
i
had
dues
back.
that
automatic
right
is
not
given
to
the
member
but
the
refunds
are
made
in
any
case
where
it's
regarded
as
in
all
equitable.
mr.
fleming
bomar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
fleming
bomar
i
would
hope
not
sir.
[laughs]
thank
you.
