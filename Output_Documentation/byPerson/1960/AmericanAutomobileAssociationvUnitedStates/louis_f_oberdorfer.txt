mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may,
i
would
advert
first
to
the
discussion
of
section
452,
the
legislative
history
about
which
mr.
justice
harlan
inquired.
we
think
that
the
contrast
between
the
provision
there
proposed
and
then
repealed
by
congress,
points
out
one
of
the
dangers
of
position
which
the
respondent
offers
to
the
government.
452
did
not
merely
provide
no
transitional
mechanism.
452
on
the
other
hand
had
some
specific
safeguards
for
the
revenue
and
that
it
limited
the
number
of
years
over
which
a
taxpayer
could
defer
prepaid
income.
it
limited
it
to
five
years.
if
--
if
the
rule
is
adopted,
posed
by
the
taxpayer
here,
the
three
a's
for
example
could
sell
a
life
membership
or
sell
a
three-year
membership
or
sell
a
five-year
membership
and
then
it
would
severely
tax
this
sound
--
this
sound
accounting
principles
to
figure
how
to
allocate
those
prepaid
dues
over
that
period
of
time.
as
far
as
mr.
justice
whittaker's
question
about,
“does
the
government
lose
anything?”
the
fact
is
that
the
government
loses
the
use
of
the
money
which
would
otherwise
be
paid
by
this
taxpayer
and
all
other
taxpayers
similarly
situated
if
the
taxpayer
paid
tax
on
realized
income
in
the
year
in
which
we
contend
it
was
realized.
this
means
the
use
of
the
money
does
mean
something
from
the
fiscal
position
in
the
united
states.
and
it
means
something
from
the
point
of
view
of
taxpayers
but
those
taxpayers
will
have
a
great
incentive
to
defer
tax.
and
that
maybe
not
necessarily
an
issue
in
this
case
but
it's
an
issue
in
other
cases.
one
of
the
thing
the
taxpayer
suggests
that
there
is
no
transition
problem
here
because
if
--
the
--
they're
already
using
the
method.
the
--
the
revenue
agents
didn't
audit
them
early
in
the
game
so
that
they
got
a
head
start.
now,
other
taxpayers
who
are
not
so
fortunate
shall
we
say
and
who
are
not
now
using
the
--
the
accounting
method
employed
by
the
three
a's
are
left
in
a
position
where
they
suffer
--
would
suffer
discrimination.
this
actually
developed
in
the
case
of
prepaid
publishing
expense
or
publisher
prepaid
subscription
prices.
there,
the
--
there
was
a
sort
of
a
grandfather
clause
adopted,
those
who
had
been
using
the
method
of
deferring
prepaid
subscriptions
were
allowed
to
continue
to
use
that
method
and
by
a
ruling
of
the
commissioner
and
this
practice
was
ratified
by
the
courts.
that
left
others
who
hadn't
gotten
away
with
it,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
in
a
severely
handicapped
position
and
newspapers,
who
couldn't
use
this
method,
agitated
for
legislation
and
got
legislation
which
put
them
in
the
same
position
as
the
other.
incidentally,
the
--
just
deal
for
a
moment
with
that
detail,
it
can
be
said
that
the
prepaid
subscription
of
a
newspaper
publisher
is
in
somewhat
different
category
from
the
prepaid
dues
here
because
a
newspaper
publisher
knows
as
of
the
end
of
the
year,
how
many
subscribers
he
has
and
how
many
days
there
are
in
a
year
for
example
and
therefore
specifically,
how
many
papers
he
will
have
to
deliver.
he
doesn't
have
to
wait
for
the
subscriber
to
call
up
and
ask
for
the
paper.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
three
a's,
there
is
no
such
specific
obligation
to
take
care
of
a
particular
member
to
the
extent
of
a
particular
amount.
the
member
--
there
is
no
liability
as
in
that
term
--
that
legal
in
that
--
in
a
legal
sense,
the
three
a's
has
no
liability
to
its
member.
it
only
has
a
contingent
obligation
to
render
some
unpredicted
and
unpredictable
amount
of
services
to
particular
members.
they
have
an
experience
that
shows
what
the
gross
is
but
they
don't
have
anything
like
the
specificity
that
is
required
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
for
the
accrual
of
an
obligation.
now,
this
--
this
brings
me
to
what
i
believe
is
--
is
the
heart
of
the
matter
here.
the
three
a's
collects
these
prepaid
dues
during
a
particular
tax
year.
this
--
these
dues
are
paid
in
cash
money.
they're
deposited
in
the
general
banking
account
of
the
corporation.
they're
available
to
the
corporation
for
all
of
its
corporate
purposes.
they
can
pay
salaries,
they
can
build
a
building,
they
can
pay
off
the
mortgage,
they
can
do
anything
with
this
money
that
they
want.
the
taxpayer
conceives
and
couldn't
what
conceive
that
this
money
when
received
and
as
of
the
end
of
the
year
which
it
is
received,
all
of
it,
is
taxable
income
in
a
classic
concept
of
that
word
as
it's
been
used
by
the
courts,
by
the
administrative
agencies
and
is
as
used
more
--
most
important
in
the
statute,
taxable
income.
they
have
absolute
dominion
and
control
of
that
money
as
of
the
end
of
the
year.
now,
that
doesn't
mean
that
this
taxpayer
and
every
taxpayer
using
their
accrual
method
for
example,
must
pay
tax
on
his
gross
income.
if
this
taxpayer
operating
on
the
accrual
method
had
an
obligation
which
had
the
precision
and
the
dignity
of
a
liability,
a
liability
to
pay
an
item
of
deductible
expense
in
the
subsequent
year,
the
taxpayer
could
deduct
from
the
gross
income
of
$15,
the
then
value
as
of
the
end
of
the
year
of
its
obligation
--
legal
obligation
to
pay
an
amount
in
the
subsequent
year.
these
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
suppose
there
was
a
--
the
--
the
--
suppose
they
have
an
obligation
to
pay
income
tax
to
the
district
of
columbia
which
is
a
deductible
item.
as
of
the
end
of
december
--
as
of
december
31,
in
this
case
1953,
the
year
has
ended.
all
the
things
that
were
--
would
create
a
liability
for
district
of
columbia
income
tax,
all
the
events
will
have
occur.
the
tax
wouldn't
have
been
assessed.
it
wouldn't
be
paid
until
april
15th,
1954
but
they
would
nevertheless,
since
they're
on
the
accrual
basis,
be
entitled
to
deduct
from
their
income
--
their
federal
income
for
the
year
1953.
their
judgment
of
what
they
--
what
they
finally
determined
to
be
the
tax
for
19
--
the
district
of
columbia
tax
for
1953.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
accrual
accounting,
of
course.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
well,
first
of
all,
that's
not
true
in
every
case
because
there
are
some
statutory
exceptions.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct,
sir.
and
there
are
other
exceptions
on
account
--
for
instance,
the
statute
permits
someone
who
sells
property
on
an
installment
basis
to
report
on
the
installment
method.
there
--
there
is
a
provision
in
our
regulations
which
is
of
long
standing
and
we
say
has
a
dignity
of
a
statute
so
that
it
isn't
--
it's
a
statutory
exception
to
the
general
rule
which
permits
a
construction
contractor
to
defer
the
apportion
of
the
profit
or
--
and
in
fact
--
of
course
the
gross
income
from
a
construction
contract
over
the
life
of
that
contract.
i
--
i
can't
philosophically
account
for
that
except
to
suggest
that
the
--
that
it's
in
the
statute
and
--
and
--
and
so
that
i
would
modify
what
mr.
bomar
says
about
our
statement
on
page
20
to
say
that
in
the
absence
of
a
statutory
provision
or
a
regulation
which
has
the
dignity
of
a
statute,
we
do
say
that
an
amount
of
dues
for
example,
paid
in
advance
for
services.
i
--
i
want
to
distinguish
between
services
and
a
payment
for
goods
but
an
amount
paid
in
advance
for
services
is
by
definition,
compensation
for
services
and
in
the
--
if
under
section
22
of
the
old
code
and
i
think
it's
441
of
the
new,
that
is
the
specifically
defined
as
gross
income.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no,
sir.
that's
correct
but
it
is
--
it
is
income
and
it
take
to
come
specifically
to
--
to
what
is
--
what
is
the
issue.
that
is
because
the
--
this
taxpayer
who
receives
this
income
is
on
the
accrual
basis
and
we
have
to
have
here
as
we
do
a
taxpayer
who
can't
quite
make
it
in
a
--
for
--
can't
quite
make
a
claim
that
the
obligation
on
which
he
relies
is
an
accrual
entitling
him
to
a
deduction,
that's
crucial
here
because
if
there
were
a
legal
obligation
of
--
of
--
with
which
--
which
has
some
precision,
the
three
a's
could
come
in
and
would
say,
“well,
would
--
would
have
filed
their
return
on
the
accrual
basis
by
taking
the
prepaid
income
in
and
by
deducting
an
expense,
an
accrued
expense
representing
the
value
of
the
obligation
to
render
--
well,
in
this,
we
don't
--
i
don't
concede
that
they
could
deduct
it
but
they
--
they
don't
come
close
to
being
able
to
deduct
it
in
this
situation.
incidentally,
there's
a
--
talking
about
clearly
reflecting
income,
this
is
the
kind
of
little
gadget
that
develops
when
we
spring
off
from
the
regular
accrual
method
into
this
general
accounting
procedure.
it's
noted
obscurely
in
our
brief
on
page
--
page
15
in
a
footnote.
that
if
the
taxpayer
had
been
able
to
find
an
accrued
expense
which
it
could
deduct,
it
would
have
had
all
of
the
profit
on
this
transaction
on
--
on
its
operations
and
it
does
make
a
profit
towards
here.
all
of
its
profit
or
its
transactions
for
the
year
1953
would've
been
taxable
in
1953
because
they
would've
taken
all
the
prepaid
expenses
and
the
gross
income
and
they
could've
only
deducted
the
value
as
of
december
31
of
the
obligation
to
pay
to
the
members.
but
by
spreading
the
whole
gross
income
over
the
two
years,
they
pick
up
a
little
of
the
profit
out
of
the
first
year
and
tuck
it
into
the
second
year.
i've
--
i
cite
that
as
one
point
in
for
--
to
support
the
proposition
that
this
method
does
not
clearly
reflect
income
because
under
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
that
i
can
see
can
it
be
argued
that
this
profit
element
in
the
case
of
a
$15
payment
of
dues,
the
profit
is
somewhere
between
25
and
50
cents.
that
will
never
be
consumed
in
rendering
services
to
members.
it's
in
the
bank
account.
the
charter
says
that
the
members
don't
get
a
refund.
this
isn't
income
just
collected
under
a
claim
of
right.
there's
no
contest
about
it,
its
income
period
and
there's
no
other
way
to
describe
it.
and
its
income
in
the
year
in
which
the
--
everything
that
happened
has
happened.
so
if
--
if
--
we
had
to
--
if
--
if
we
were
just
debating
here
which
i
think
we're
not,
we
were
just
debating
a
question
of
whether
this
method
clearly
reflects
income,
i
think
the
commissioner
could
stop
right
there
and
say
it
doesn't
clearly
reflect
income.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
therefore,
he
used
his
method.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
the
court
of
claims
found
that
it
did
clearly
reflect
income
in
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no,
sir.
i
think
that
that's
--
and
i
would
construe
those
findings
as
a
finding
that
within
the
--
that
it
clearly
reflects
income
on
--
under
accounting
principles
but
our
regulations
refer
to
principles
of
income
tax
accounting.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
on
the
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
does,
although
we
can
make
this
argument
within
the
four
corners
where
the
code
as
it
did
now
exist.
that
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it
--
yes,
the
other
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
the
specific
statement
of
the
finance
committee
and
the
ways
and
means
committee.
then
as
of
1954,
this
categorically,
the
prepaid
items
with
some
minor
exemptions
are
fundamentally
income
even
to
an
accrual
basis
tax
payer
is
we
think
strong
medicine.
the
--
the
accrual
--
we
--
to
--
to
come
back
to
--
to
the
fundamental,
the
--
the
internal
revenue
code
unlike
accounting
generally,
operates
on
the
basis
of
an
annual
accounting
period.
the
taxable
year
is
for
most
purposes
the
--
the
beginning
and
end
of
--
of
everything.
it's
a
--
it's
an
--
it's
in
--
it's
the
whole
story
and
everything
that
--
every
event
and
every
fact
which
relates
to
a
taxpayer's
liability
for
tax
for
that
year
must
have
occurred
within
the
annual
accounting
period.
now,
on
a
--
in
a
--
in
a
case
of
a
cash-basis
taxpayers,
we
understand
the
principle.
his
tax
liability
for
that
year
consists
of
the
difference
between
the
taxable
gross
income
which
is
realized
in
cash,
in
hand,
physically
in
his
possession
and
the
cash
deductions
for
items
at
the
expense
of
what
she's
paying
out
of
pocket
in
that
year.
we
say
that
the
difference
between
the
cash
basis
and
the
accrual-basis
tax
payer
--
well,
first
of
all,
they're
--
that
what
we
--
we
insist
at
--
that
the
annual
accounting
period
applies
to
both.
this
court
has
said
that
many
times
that
the
principle
of
annual
accounting
applies
equally
to
the
cash-basis
taxpayer
and
to
the
accrual-basis
taxpayer.
the
difference
is
that
if
the
taxpayer
is
on
the
accrual
method,
you
measure
his
tax
not
precisely
by
what
he
has
received
in
cash
and
what
he
has
paid
out
in
cash
during
the
year.
you
measure
it
in
terms
of
what
rights
to
income
he's
acquired
during
the
year
and
what
liabilities
for
the
payment
--
for
the
payment
of
expense
he's
incurred
during
the
year.
now,
how
do
we
get
mixed
up
with
this
--
with
the
prepaid
dues?
we
get
mixed
up
--
we
--
we
don't
get
--
want
a
way
to
avoid
getting
mixed
up
is
to
recognize
that
when
a
taxpayer
has
received
compensation
for
services
in
cash,
in
hand,
subject
to
his
absolute
dominion
and
control,
he
has
the
same
or
greater
right
to
that
income
than
he
would
have
if
all
he
had
as
of
the
end
of
the
year
was
a
promise
of
someone
to
pay
him
the
dues.
the
payment
is
an
accrual
in
this
--
when
it's
paid
in
advance
because
it
--
there's
nothing
less
to
happen.
and
we
--
we
think
that
if
you
adopted
any
other
rule
which
permitted
the
taxpayer
and
has
accounted
to
roam
at
large
in
what
are
called
general
principles
of
good
accounting
practice
and
determine
when
those
prepaid
items
are
taxable
according
to
when
some
good
accountant
or
some
bad
accountant
decides
that
the
income
has
been
earned
in
a
sense
of
accounting
that
the
court
would
be
exposing
the
revenue
service
to
a
very
difficult
and
we
think
unnecessary
burden.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
the
--
the
difference
is
that
under
the
cash
basis,
this
taxpayer
would
be
taxable
on
the
dues
he
received
in
advance
but
he
could
only
deduct
in
the
year
in
which
he
received
the
dues,
the
amounts
that
he'd
actually
spent
out
of
--
out
of
pocket
for
all
those
expenses.
mr.

no,
sir.
we
think
that
this
taxpayer
should
be
allowed
to
accrue
items
of
income
and
to
accrue
items
of
expense
if
he
has
any.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
--
i
don't
--
i
--
i
don't
want
to
tell
the
three
a's
how
they
could
change
their
business
so
they
could
accrue
a
deduction
for
--
for
their
obligation
to
their
members,
it
maybe
that
they
could
do
it.
i
--
i
think
my
burden
here
is
to
demonstrate
that
they
haven't
but
a
taxpayer
could
accrue
an
obligation
by
incurring
a
--
well,
that
the
example
that
i
gave
mr.
justice
stewart
about
an
accrued
obligation
to
pay
taxes
is
an
example.
the
three
a's
as
i
said
--
the
three
a's
pays
taxes
to
the
district
of
columbia.
if
it
were
on
the
cash
basis,
it
could
not
deduct
as
of
december
31
its
liability
for
taxes
which
it
hadn't
yet
calculated.
it
can
only
deduct
the
actual
out
of
pocket
payment
of
taxes.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
were
on
the
accrual
basis,
it
could
deduct
what
it
anticipates
to
be
its
tax
liability.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
we
say
that
--
first
would
--
one
reason
in
this
case
is
that
they
haven't
--
they
--
they
haven't
--
they
haven't
set
the
books
of
that
one.
but
more
important,
they
haven't
incurred
a
liability.
they
don't
owe
these
members
anything.for
example,
like
the
newspaper
publisher
owes
his
subscriber,
they
don't
--
they
--
no
--
they
don't
owe
anything
to
a
member
until
the
member
picks
up
a
telephone
and
says
come
tow
my
car,
my
battery
has
rundown.
at
that
point,
they've
incurred
a
liability
but
as
of
december
31,
they
can
only
guess
an
estimate
as
to
what
they
will
have
to
spend
for
the
benefit
of
--
of
--
well,
some
members
don't
ask
for
any
service.
they're
in
the
--
they're
in
the
organization
just
to
be
good
citizens
or
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it's
conceivable.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
it's
conceivable
--
it's
conceivable
that
if
this
could
be
calculated
with
the
precision
that
insurance
companies
calculate
their
liabilities
on
a
scientific
actuarial
basis
that
there
could
be
an
accrual
at
that
point.
there's
no
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
or
it
could
be
done
--
it
could
be
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
there
--
but
there
are
--
there
are
--
there
are
tests
about
what
is
an
actuarial
as
distinguished
from
an
accounting
estimate
of
the
future.
this
court
has
had
this
kind
of
problem.
i
think
this
court
has
had
that
some
courts
have
about
determining
the
value
of
future
interest
for
example
in
--
in
a
state
tax
maters.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
--
i
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
serious
problem.
there's
been
no
suggestion
here
that
the
three
a's
has
made
an
actuarial
demonstration
of
its
--
of
its
liability.
and
even
then,
it
--
the
liability
itself
might
not
be
enough
that
there
has
to
be
a
liability
with
respect
to
an
item
of
expense,
deductible
expense.
and
the
--
it
requires
--
you
--
you
just
can't
do
that
in
gross.
there's
a
case
in
the
second
circuit,
the
spencer
and
white
case
where
this
has
been
analyzed
in
terms
of
a
contract
obligation
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
a
mere
contract
obligation
is
--
does
--
is
in
to
--
to
render
general
services,
is
not
something
that
is
susceptible
to
accrual.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
dollars
and
cents?
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that's
--
that's
a
lot
when
--
when
you're
--
when
you're
the
united
states
but
that
is
all
that's
involved.
it
--
the
other
point
in
this
connection
is
that,
if
--
if
the
taxpayer's
proposal
is
adopted,
it
will
--
and
--
and
he
insists
on
saying
that
he's
entitled
to
it
because
he's
been
doing
it
all
these
years,
he
infers
that
a
new
corporation
or
one
that
has
been
in
business
during
at
another
way
is
not
entitled
to
change
and
defer.
he
sets
up
the
--
he
creates
an
opportunity
for
a
--
a
discrimination.
we
--
we
think
that
this,
though
--
though
the
law
as
we
understand
it
makes
it
a
great
deal
simpler
for
the
revenue
agent
to
operate,
mr.
justice
whittaker.
he
can
--
he
can
look
at
the
man's
books
and
tell
that
he's
received
the
money
but
he
would
have
a
great
difficulty
looking
at
the
books
of
barbershops
and
beauty
parlors
and
taxi
companies,
service
companies
that
don't
have
the
excellent
accounting
system
that
the
three
a's
have.
and
come
back
with
their
counter
as
to
when
realistically
in
the
accounting
sense,
whatever
that
means,
when
realistically,
these
prepaid
items
were
earned.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
have
a
book
of
coupons
from
a
taxi
company
which
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
(inaudible)
paid
in
advance.
this
is
a
--
this
is
not
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
--
and
isolated
from
it.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
yes,
sir.
the
same
thing.
the
--
this
--
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
but
--
no.
what
i'm
talking
about,
an
advance
payment
for
coupons
which
--
i've
got
it
sitting
in
my
--
my
desk
floor
and
i'll
use
those
--
when
did
the
taxi
company
earned
those?
i'm
--
i
don't
know.
and
the
point
--
point
is
not
that
it's
impossible
to
determine
but
you
open
into
a
--
an
area
of
negotiation
and
bargaining
between
the
accountant
for
the
taxpayer
and
the
accountant
for
the
government
and
then
that
bargain
has
to
be
resolved
administratively
or
it
has
to
be
litigated
which
would
be,
frank,
they
have
to
go
into
court.
it's
--
it
would
be
a
--
another
kind
of
evaluation
problem
in
which
one
--
one
tax
--
the
taxpayer
would
argue
strenuously
for
one
theory
of
accounting
and
the
government
would
argue
for
another
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
indeed,
indeed.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
this
is
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
no,
sir.
this
is
on
--
this
would
only
--
this
is
--
would
be
inherent
in
--
only
an
accrual
accounting
could
be
administered
with
great
position
and
great
ease.
this
is
only
inherent
in
a
--
in
a
procedure
that
says
that
the
united
states
must
defer
collection
of
taxes
until
in
the
opinion
of
accountants,
the
money
which
is
--
which
is
clearly
income
has
in
accordance
with
some
accounting
principle
been
full
“earned”.
and
that
word
earned
does
not
appear
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
section
41
means
to
us
that
the
method
of
accounting
can
be
used
provided
it
pays
proper
respect
to
the
annual
accounting
period.
and
the
method
of
accounting
calculates
taxable
income
on
the
case
of
the
cash-basis
taxpayer,
on
account
of
his
receipts
and
disbursements
for
the
taxable
year,
in
the
case
of
the
accrual-method
taxpayer,
on
account
of
the
creation
of
rights
to
income
in
him
in
that
year
or
the
creation
of
liabilities
for
the
payment
of
deductions
in
that
year.
in
any
method
of
accounting
which
does
that
is
permissible.
one
that
does
not
--
doesn't
pay
proper
respect
to
the
annual
accounting
system
and
we
think
that
in
the
absence
of
express
statutory
exception
which
maybe
advisable
but
it
hasn't
been
enacted
yet
except
--
it
was
enacted
and
repealed.
in
the
absence
of
such
a
statutory
exception
or
something
that
is
embedded
in
the
regulations
in
a
precise
way
like
the
completed
contract
method
of
construction
accounting
that
the
--
the
court
should
follow
the
principles
that
it's
laid
down
dealing
more
directly
with
the
deduction
of
expenses.
and
say
that
even
though
sometimes
there
maybe
distortions,
those
distortions
can
be
taken
care
of
by
net
operating
loss
carry-forwards
and
the
--
the
taxpayer's
remedy,
if
they
have
a
remedy,
is
--
in
this
area
we
think
is
what's
accounted.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
i
--
i
was
--
i
was
troubled
by
that
when
i
saw
it
as
the
reply
brief.
i
didn't
see
this
letter
until
the
taxpayer
called
our
attention
to
it.
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
--
as
that's
concerned,
we
would
look
not
to
what
the
congress
did
but
to
what
they
said
before
they
did
anything.
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
what
the
house
and
--
house
committee
exactly
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
and
--
mr.
louis
f.
oberdorfer
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice.
