justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
suggest
one
point
at
this
point
that
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
hope
you'll
cover
in
your
argument.
that
is
what
you
say
that
the
government's
argument
which
is
i
recall
the
michigan
case
was
not
presented
as
to
the
bearing
of
sections
452
and
462
of
the
1940
code
in
congressional
action,
what
bearing
all
that
has
on
this
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
quite
understand
it.
yes,
i
mean
one
can
say
that.
as
i
--
maybe
i
have
this
wrong
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
but
here
is
--
here
is
what
bothers
me.i
was
in
dissent
in
michigan
as
you
know
and
i
don't
recall
this
argument
being
made.
but
as
i
read
--
as
i
understand
this
problem,
when
452
was
proposed,
it
was
proposed
to
accomplish
what
you're
arguing
for
now
and
was
seemingly
recognized
as
being
something
necessary
to
put
into
the
law
if
what
you
are
arguing
for
would
be
permissible.
then
the
congress
enacted
it
and
the
treasury
came
back
and
said,
â€œit
had
this
enormous
effect
on
revenue
and
congress
repealed
it."
now,
to
me,
that
has
some
substantial
bearing
on
the
validity
of
--
of
your
position.and
just
to
say
that
it
was
1954
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you
can
say
it
but
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
answer
this
--
do
you
answer
the
government's
argument
in
your
reply
brief?
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
i
haven't
heard
that
yet,
maybe
that's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
were
the
findings
of
the
court
of
claims
as
to
whether
it
did
or
it
did
not
properly
reflect
income?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
didn't
introduce
me
the
evidence,
did
you?
the
government
didn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
you
arguing
now
that
we
should
overturn
those
findings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
well,
that
--
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
although
under
accounting
principles,
commercial
accounting
principles
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
this
does
properly
reflect
income.
still,
that
there
is
a
--
under
tax
accounting
principles,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
doesn't.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
depends
a
good
deal
on
the
validity
of
your
argument
on
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
452
and
--
and
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
a
little
more
difficult
without
the
exception.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(voice
overlap)
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
scope
do
you
give
to
section
41
--
what
scope
to
do
you
give
to
section
41
under
your
view?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
agree
with
what
--
i've
--
i'm
now
going
to
pursue
this
reply
brief
on
this
452.
do
you
agree
with
what's
said
there
that
it
seem
to
have
been
generally
understood
between
the
bureau
and
the
--
the
treasury
and
the
committee
and
what
transpire
there
was
not
to
deem
with
--
be
deemed
with
in
fact
one
way
or
the
other,
the
preceding
law?
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
you
can
merely
leave
that
out
of
account
on
what
you're
driven
back
to
is
your
position
that
under
the
cases
in
this
court
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
your
position
is
sustained
or
if
not
sustained,
why
--
and
this
is
a
new
problem
why
we
ought
to
--
to
construe
the
statutes
the
way
you
talk
--
you
argue.
that
is
what
it
comes
down
to.
