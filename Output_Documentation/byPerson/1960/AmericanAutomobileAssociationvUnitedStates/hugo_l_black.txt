bomar,
one
of
the
questions
asked
by
mr.
justice
whittaker,
the
government
counsel
told
me
to
ask
this
one.
i
suppose
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
he
asked
what
the
difference
in
dollars
and
cents
in
the
government
in
the
two
systems
that
reporting
the
taxes.
is
there
a
particular
difference
or
was
your
--
your
association
(inaudible)
on
the
cash
basis
and
accrual
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
any
gain
--
any
gain
to
the
association
in
the
long
run?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
it
yet.
on
a
case
basis,
you
would
support
all
the
case
you
get
in
the
year
and
only
when
you
pay
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
on
your
accrual
basis
as
it's
(inaudible)
quite
difference
to
you.
why
do
you
--
why
does
it
make
that
much
difference
to
you,
you
say.
i
don't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
clubs
knew
because
i'm
sure
yours
is
not
but
suppose
if
instead
growing
fast,
it's
losing
the
members.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
heard
a
lot
of
talk
about
the
profits
here.
i
didn't
know
anything
about
it
(inaudible)
in
your
association.[laughs]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
part
--
the
part
--
the
part
was
interested
to
me
was
you
said
the
members
didn't
get
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
that
profit
is
enough
to
disqualify
judge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
suppose
that
profit
if
prospective
profit
is
enough
to
disqualify
judges.
