chief
justice
earl
warren
number
33,
arthur
m.
mcphaul,
petitioner
versus
united
states.
mr.
goodman
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
i
understand
you
to
say
there
was
but
one
witness
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
a
witness
who
would
be
difficult
for
the
government
to
produce?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
evidence
that
the
petitioner
had
any
record
in
this
division?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
government's
argument
in
the
court
below
too
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
wasn't.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
reserve
your
time.
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mr.
friedman,
the
fact
that
mr.
tavenner
said
my
question
to
you
was
not
answered
by
that
statement,
in
my
judgment
does
not
mean
that
it
was
not
answered
and
isn't
this
--
isn't
this
an
answer?
the
question
is
as
to
whether
or
not
you
are
refusing
to
produce
the
records
directed
to
be
produced
under
the
subpoena.
mr.
mcphaul:
my
answer
to
that
is,
i
refuse
to
answer
this
or
any
questions
which
deals
with
possession
or
custody
of
the
books
and
the
records
called
for
in
this
subpoena.
i
claim
my
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now
please
tell
me
why
that
isn't
a
definitive
answer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
doesn't
--
doesn't
this
question
deal
with
his
possession
or
custody
of
the
books
and
records
called
for
in
the
subpoena?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
no,
but
doesn't
that
question
itself
have
to
do
with
his
possession
or
custody
of
the
books
and
records
called
for
in
the
subpoena?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
he
says
he
refuses
to
answer
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
his
reason
is
that
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
all
questions
he
says
is
connected
with
the
custody
and
--
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
possession.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
suppose
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
suppose
that
a
committee
has
the
right
to
put
questions
and
put
in
--
in
a
great
number
of
forms
so
that
a
man
at
his
peril
will
have
to
--
will
have
to
analyze
every
single
one
of
them
to
see
whether
he
is
--
has
covered
every
single
phase
of
it
with
his
--
his
claim
of
self-incrimination.
he
stated
at
the
outset
here,
did
he
not,
that
he
was
not
going
to
answer
any
questions
because
he
claimed
the
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now
are
you
going
to
let
the
committee
twist
the
question
around
in
such
a
way
that
--
that
finally
it
will
be
left
up
to
the
--
to
the
question
of
will
you
or
will
you
not
and
when
he
says,
"i
will
not."
you
say,
"well,
you
didn't
claim
the
fifth
amendment
as
to
that",
where
you
said
all
along
that
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment.
isn't
that
enough
in
my
sympathy
in
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
didn't
say
they
didn't
try
to
trap
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
in
the
record
mr.
friedman
to
establish
that
there
were
books
of
the
association
or
that
he
hasn't
and
had
the
obligation
to
do
it.
what
is
there
in
the
record
of
the
trial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh
wait,
what
cases
do
you
rely
on
for
--
for
that
if
any?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
those
are
applicable
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
--
on
--
under
these
facts,
under
the
--
do
you
think
that
the
--
that
the
judgments
in
those
cases
are
--
are
pertinent
to
this
judgment
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
not
talking
about
the
reasoning
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
that
--
in
that
case
--
in
those
cases
wasn't
there
proof,
adequate
proof
that
they
--
that
they
did
exist
and
--
and
that
they
did
have
--
the
man
did
have
possession
of
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
--
isn't
that
different
from
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
if
he
answered
to
the
question,
isn't
he
in
exactly
the
same
position
that
defendant
was
in
the
rogers
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why?
what's
the
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
well,
if
he
had
answered,
i
no
longer
have
the
records,
that
needn't
be
an
hypothetically
the
position
of
ms.
rogers,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
if
--
if
he
had
answered
the
--
the
question
that
was,
at
the
time,
asked
to
him
by
saying,
"i
do
not
have
the
record."
now,
if
they
asked
him
who
--
if
he
knew
who
have
this
and
he
refused
to
testify,
would
you
be
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
that
would
be
alright?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
he
could
stop
any
place
he
wanted
after
he
once
said
that
he
didn't
have
the
--
have
the
records
or
that
he
did
have
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
he
said,
"i
don't
have
control
of
it."
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
say
that
--
that
you've
made
a
crime
a
basic
case
to
the
effect
that
that
--
that
the
association
did
have
the
books,
did
have
books,
and
that
he
had
control
on
them.
now,
if
he
said
he
didn't,
why
wouldn't
he
be
in
the
same
position
as
defendant
rogers
in
that
colloquy
after
you
have
as
you
say
made
a
prima
facie
case
of
these
other
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
were
such
record
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
which
the
government
has
not
proved.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
friedman,
i
understood
mr.
goodman
to
read
some
portion
of
the
charge
to
the
effect
that
the
--
the
question
of
whether
he
had
such
records
could
not
be
an
issue
on
that
trial.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
then
--
then
how
is
that
--
if
that
is
true,
how
does
that
square
with
your
opinion
or
your
statement
rather
that
--
that
they
could've
introduced
such
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know,
but
--
but
the
--
a
plea
of
not
guilty
raises
every
issue.
it
raises
every
issue
under
--
under
the
indictment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
and
--
and
if
he
willfully
failed
to
produce,
it
means
that
he
had
the
documents
and
that
there
were
such
documents
and
--
and
you
were
going
to
infer
his
guilt
from
the
fact
that
he
didn't
deny
that
he
had
them
at
the
committee
hearing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you
mr.
goodman.
