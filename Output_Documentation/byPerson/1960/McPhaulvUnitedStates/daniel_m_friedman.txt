mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
summarize
what
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
willfully
refusing
to
produce
documents
before
the
house
of
subcommittee.
it's
admitted
he
didn't
produce
it.
so
the
whole
question
in
each
case
is
whether
this
failure
to
produce
is
refusal
to
produce
was
a
willful
one.
we
think
that
the
government
establishes
a
showing
of
willfulness
when
it
proves
first
that
the
subcommittee
had
a
reasonable
basis
upon
which
to
subpoena
these
records
from
this
individual.
and
second
that
when
this
individual
appeared
in
response
to
the
subpoena,
he
offered
no
justification
or
explanation
or
excuse
for
his
non-production
of
the
documents,
but
merely
said,
"i
will
not."
and
therefore,
we
think
in
these
circumstances
in
the
absence
of
any
explanation,
it
was
a
reasonable
inference
by
the
jury
that
this
was
a
willful
refusal
to
produce.
that
is,
it
was
a
deliberate
and
intentional
clouting
of
the
commission's
authority.
and
we
think
that
in
these
circumstances,
where
there
is
no
questions
raised,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
at
no
time
either
before
the
subcommittee,
before
the
district
court,
before
the
court
of
appeals
or
before
this
court
has
petitioner
ever
suggested
that
he
had
any
excuse
for
non-production.
he's
never
claimed
that
he
doesn't
have
the
documents.
he
couldn't
have
produced
it.
he
was
not
connected
with
the
association.
the
whole
argument
is
that
it
was
incumbent
on
the
government
as
part
of
its
affirmative
case
to
prove
that
he
had
capacity
to
produce.
and
our
basic
position
is
that
i'm
showing
that
we
may,
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
petitioner
to
come
forward
with
some
explanation.
and
i
will
develop
that
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
now,
i
would
first
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
--
whether
the
subcommittee
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
issuing
this
subpoena
to
this
petitioner
to
call
upon
him
to
produce
this
record.
now,
the
evidence
on
this
which
mr.
goodman
keep
referring
to
as
a
separate
record
was
in
fact
taken
before
the
judge
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
because
the
judge
held
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
this
court
that
pertinency
is
a
matter
for
the
court
not
for
the
jury.
and
similarly
we
think
the
question
of
the
pertinency
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
commission's
committee
seeking
to
obtain
the
records
from
this
man
is
comparable
perhaps
in
many
ways
different
but
fundamentally
comparable
to
the
showing
of
probable
cause
to
the
issuance
of
a
warrant.
we
know
it
is
a
question
of
law
whether
the
committee
had
any
basis
in
seeking
the
records
from
this
man.
now
what
has
the
record
shown
us?
the
record
on
this
is
based
on
the
testimony
of
then
senator
potter
who
was
then
member
of
the
committee.
to
begin
with,
at
pages
17
and
22
of
the
record,
senator
potter
testified
that
the
civil
rights
congress
had
been
declared
a
subversive
organization
both
by
the
attorney
general
and
by
the
committee
itself.
now
we're
contending
mr.
justice
black
in
answer
to
a
question
that
this
evidence
is
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
civil
rights
congress
was
or
was
not
some
subversive
organization.
all
that
we
say
is
the
committee
on
the
basis
of
this
information
was
justified
in
saying
it
wanted
to
have
a
look
at
these
records.
that's
all
it
was
asking
the
man
to
do
and
have
a
look
at
them.
now
the
committee
also,
the
testimony
by
senator
potter
particularly
at
page
22
--
sorry,
page
21
and
also
at
page
17,
senator
potter
stated,
"the
committee
had
information
that
mr.
mcphaul
was
executive
director
or
executive
secretary
for
civil
rights
congress."
now
one
basis
for
this
information
was
the
letterhead
in
the
committee
files
showing
that
in
1947,
this
man
was
the
executive
secretary
of
the
association.
there
is
nothing
in
this
statement
that
limits
this
statement,
this
testimony
indicating
that
was
the
only
thing.
and
significantly
i
think
when
mr.
goodman
read
to
the
court
this
question
that
senator
potter
where
there
was
any
evidence
taken
at
the
executive
hearing
whether
mr.
mcphaul
was
ever
identified
as
the
member
of
the
civil
rights
congress.
mr.
goodman
neglected
to
read
the
very
next
sentence
on
page
18
which
is
mr.
goodman's
statement,
"i
will
object
to
that
on
the
ground
of
that
it
constitutes
hearsay."
now,
if
the
petitioner
question
the
basis
of
the
committee
for
subpoenaing
mr.
mcphaul,
i
petition
the
question
that
the
committee
had
any
basis
for
taking
this
man
was
in
fact
connected
with
the
organization,
he
could
have
cross-examined
senator
potter
at
this
hearing
before
the
judge,
cross-examine
on
one
peripheral
issue.
at
no
point
did
he-cross
examine
senator
potter
on
this
issue.
now
as
i
shall
indicate
briefly
later
in
my
argument.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
restate
your
formulation
of
the
issue
somewhat,
the
committee
had
evidence,
had
a
basis
for
thinking,
one,
that
this
was
subversive
organization
and
two,
that
this
man
was
an
officer
of
that
organization.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we're
--
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we're
not
attempting
to
use
this
to
prove
that
his
refusal
was
willful.
we're
using
directly
--
we're
using
this
as
the
basis
to
show
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we're
using
it
to
show
that
the
subcommittee
had
a
reasonable
basis.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
mr.
justice
that
where
he
raises
no
issue
as
to
whether
he
has
possession
or
custody
and
whether
there's
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
tribunal,
the
issues,
the
subpoena
to
believe
that
he
has
these
papers
affirms
then
on
him
to
come
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
evidence
--
leaving
out
the
evidence
as
to
why
he
was
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
mr.
justice
i
don't
think
we
can
leave
those
statements
out
of
the
case
because
we
think
they
were
pertinent
on
this
issue
of
whether
the
committee
had
a
reasonable
basis.
but
whether
--
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
what
the
evidence
shows
with
respect
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
the
committee
had
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
its
--
it
was
within
the
--
it
was
within
the
committee's
proper
function.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
i'd
like
to
come
now
to
the
evidence
in
the
record
dealing
with
his
appearance
before
the
subcommittee,
the
precise
transcript
of
the
proceeding.
that's
reprinted
in
the
record
at
pages
31
to
page
34
and
i'd
like
to
first
read
to
the
court
from
the
early
part
of
his
appearance
in
middle
of
page
31.
this
is
when
he
appeared,
accompanied
by
counsel
before
he
was
sworn
and
about
half
way
down,
mr.
wood,
congressman
wood,
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee,
"are
you
prepared
to
produce
the
documents
and
papers
that
have
been
called
upon
for
you
to
produce
under
the
subpoena?"
the
witness
answered,
"mr.
wood
i
refuse
to
answer
this
or
any
question
which
deals
with
the
possession
or
custodies
of
the
books
and
records
called
for
in
the
subpoena.
i
claim
my
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution."
now
then
after
some
further
colloquy
the
witness
was
sworn.
he
had
some
certain
preliminary
questions
as
to
his
age
and
birth
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
like
to
ask
the
witness
if
he
has
any
other
reason
for
refusing
to
produce
the
documents
called
for
in
the
subpoena.
the
answer
is
i
think
my
answer
covers.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
mr.
justice
my
point
is,
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment
he
did
not
refuse
to
produce
the
documents
under
any
claim
of
self-incrimination.
i'd
like
to
read
to
the
court
at
page
34,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
the
circumstances
under
which
he
actually
refused
to
do
it.
mr.
tavenner:
the
question
is
as
to
whether
or
not
you
were
refusing
to
produce
the
records
directly
to
be
produced
on
this
subpoena.
mr.
mcphaul:
my
answer
for
that
is,
i
refuse
to
answer
this
or
any
questions
which
deal
with
possessions
or
custody
of
the
books
and
records
called
for
in
the
subpoena.
and
again
he
claimed
his
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
tavenner
says,
"my
question
to
you
was
not
answered.
my
question
is
whether
or
not
you
are
refusing
to
produce
the
record."
and
mr.
mcphaul
said,
"i
have
answered."
mr.
tavenner
said,
"no
sir.
you
have
stated
that
you
refused
to
answer
any
questions
pertaining
to
that.
i
have
not
asked
you
a
question
that
pertains
to
that.
i
have
asked
you
to
produce
the
record.
now
will
you
produce
it?"
answer
by
mr.
mcphaul,
"i
will
not."
mr.
mcphaul
did
not
say
i
will
not
produce
these
records
because
their
production
i
tend
to
incriminate
it.
mr.
mcphaul
specifically
put
his
claim
of
privilege
on
the
refusal
to
answer
questions
with
respect
to
the
possession
and
custody
of
the
record.
his
answer
to
the
question
will
you
produce
and
was
i
will
not.
and
there's
no
explanation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
reference
to
every
question
that
he
was
asked.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
its
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
he
claims
the
fifth
amendment
mr.
justice
with
respect
to
questions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
claims
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
with
respect
to
answering
the
question
as
to
the
possession
and
custody
of
the
documents.
he
keeps
repeating
questions
with
respect
to
the
possession
of
custody.
he
does
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
whether
he
means
in
this
circumstance
that
he
is
claiming
the
fifth
amendment
ground
for
refusing
to
produce.
he
was
claiming
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
ground
for
refusing
to
answer
a
question
whether
he
has
any
excuse.
i
--
i
think
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
he
was
subpoenaed.
this
subpoena
directed
on
both
to
produce
the
records
and
to
testify.
now
i
think
if
he
claims
this
privilege
with
respect
to
producing
the
records.
he
is
required
so
to
state
to
make
it
explicit
to
the
committee
that
he
is
refusing
to
produce
these
records
because
of
a
claim
that
their
production
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
know.
he
--
there
maybe
any
number
of
reasons
why
he
refused
to
produced
them.
but
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
then
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
said,
whether
he's
prepared
to
produce
them.
he
may
be
--
not
be
willing
to
produce
them
because
he
doesn't
think
the
committee
has
any
authority
to
ask
him
to
produce
them.
that
may
be
the
reason,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
may
just
think
this
committee
has
no
business
to
be
conducting
this
investigation.
all
that
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
respect
to
the
questions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
with
respect
to
the
question.
well,
let
me
--
let
me
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
he
wasn't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
i
fully
agree
that
the
committee
should
not
try
to
trap
the
witness
if
the
witness
claimed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
understand.
if
the
committee
--
if
he
--
if
he
does
anything
which
makes
clear
to
the
committee
that
he
is
claiming
the
privilege
refusing
to
either
produce
documents
or
answer
questions
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
because
of
the
claim
of
privilege
which
informs
the
committee
that
he
is
refusing
to
do
it
on
that
basis.
that
is
the
fifth.
on
the
other
hand
we
think
a
witness
also
has
an
obligation
to
make
clear
to
the
committee
the
basis
on
which
he
is
refusing
to
produce
this
document.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
i
think
it's
somewhat
ambiguous
there
but
i
--
i
would
like
to
come
to
something
else
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
--
we
don't
think
he
could
invoke
the
claim
because
these
were
not
his
personal
records.
these
were
the
records
that
the
civil
rights
commerce
we
think
under
the
precedence
of
this
court,
the
records
of
a
noncooperative
association,
the
claim
of
self-incrimination
cannot
be
made
by
someone
who
is
called
upon
to
produce
those
records.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
assume
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
--
assuming
--
it
wasn't
--
let's
assume
that
that
--
that
he
invoked
his
--
properly
invoked
his
privilege
with
respect
to
the
production
of
these
books
and
records,
even
assuming
that,
we
don't
think
this
was
any
excuse
for
his
non-compliance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
an
--
that's
an
end
of
the
case
except
for
the
argument,
the
basic
argument
that
it's
necessary
for
us
nevertheless
to
show
that
he
had
possession,
custody
and
he'll
--
able
to
produce
the
books.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
there
is
no
affirmative
evidence
to
prove
that
he
had
--
either
that
he
had
possession
of
these
books
or
that
these
books
and
records
ever
existed.
and
our
position
is
that
when
he
was
called
upon
to
produce
the
books
and
record,
if
in
fact
he
didn't
have
to
if
in
fact
there
were
no
such
books
and
records,
it
was
obligatory
on
him
so
to
advice
the
committee.
now
i
would
like
to
come
to
this
point.
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
petitioner
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
relied
basically
we
think
on
the
rationale
of
the
bryan
and
fleischman
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
they
--
the
reasoning
is
answered.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
they
are
pertinent
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think
they're
pertinent
in
the
light
of
the
basis
on
which
the
court
reached
its
judgment
in
those
cases.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
there
was
and
that
--
but
however--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
the
facts
are
different
conceivably
mr.
chief
justice.
the
facts
are
different
but
we
think
the
same
reasoning,
the
same
reasoning
which
lead
to
the
holding
in
those
cases
that
a
claim
that
the
subcommittee
did
not
have
a
forum
(inaudible)
couldn't
be
raised
in
court
for
the
first
time.
it
wasn't
read
in
the
courts.
the
subcommittee
also
indicate
to
us
that
when
a
demand
is
made
on
a
person
who
for
whom
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
to
believe
that
he
has
the
record,
that
is
obligatory
on
him
to
come
forward
and
to
state
either
that
he
doesn't
have
or
he
can't.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
want
to
emphasize
that
if
this
man
had
the
records,
one
of
two
possibilities.
one,
he
had
the
records,
he
could've
produce
it.
if
he
had
the
records,
he
could've
produced.
it
seems
to
us
he
clearly
was
in
contempt
when
he
stated,
"i
will
not."
number
two,
let's
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
this
organization
had
no
records
or
this
man
could
not
have
produced
them.
if
that
were
the
facts,
we
don't
see
any
basis
on
which
he
could
possibly
claim
that
he
will
be
incriminated
if
he
told
the
committee,
"i'm
sorry,
i
can't
produce
them,
i
don't
have
it."
now
he
doesn't
deny
that.
he
says,
if
he
came
before
the
committee
and
told
the
committee,
"i
don't
have
them."
that
wouldn't
be
the
end
of
it.
the
committee
will
say,
well
then,
who
has
it?
why
don't
you
have
it?
and
so
on.
we
think
a
line
can
be
drawn.
we
think
he
could
fairly
claim
a
privilege
once
he
has
told
the
committee
that
he
does
not
have
the
books
and
records.
he
--
the
privilege
under
the
decision
in
the
(inaudible)
case
to
refuse
to
answer
questions,
any
questions
with
respect
to
the
possession
or
custody
of
the
record.
but
we
don't
think
when
he
is
subpoenaed
to
produce
the
records,
he
has
any
claims
to
say
under
the
claim
of
privilege.
i'm
not
even
going
to
tell
you
that
i
don't
have
them.
we
think
if
he
doesn't
have
them,
he
has
got
a
burden
at
least
to
tell
that
to
the
committee.
to
give
the
committee
a
chance
if
in
fact
he
does
not
have
the
records
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so
mr.
justice
because
i
don't
see
how
that
would
tend
to
incriminate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
he
could
refuse
to
disclose
this
connection
or
identity
with
the
corporation
but
i
don't
believe
he
can
refuse
to
state
that
he
doesn't
have
the
documents
that
if
he
was
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
depending
on
the
circumstance,
i
think
that
might
well
in
some
circumstance.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
he
might
well
claim
that
privilege
but
i
don't
think
that
question
is
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
the
records.
in
other
words,
if
--
if
he's
got
the
records,
it
seems
to
me
he
can't
offer
as
the
excuse
for
not
producing
them
but
it
hasn't
been
proven
that
he
is
the
secretary
according
in
the
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
distinction
is
that
in
the
rogers
case,
the
defendant
had
admitted
her
membership
in
the
communist
party.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
question
was,
having
admitted
the
membership
in
the
communist
party
could
she
then
refuse
to
state
to
whom
she
had
turned
the
records?
and
this
court
held
that
she
in
effect
having
admitted
the
broad
thing
that
she
was
a
member
of
the
communist
party,
she
couldn't
claim
that
the
disclosure
of
the
details
of
how
she
got
to
that
office
would
tend
to
incriminate.
he
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
think
it
has
to
say,
i
no
longer
have
the
record.
i
think
if
all
he
says
is,
"i
do
not
have
the
record.
i
cannot
produce
the
record."
he
doesn't
indicate
whether
it's
because
he
doesn't
have
them,
because
he's
not
connected
with
this
association,
because
for
all
we
know,
whatever
happened.
all
we're
saying
is
that
it
was
the
burden
on
him
to
come
forward
and
state
the
simple
fact
if
he
did
not
have
the
record,
that
he
could
not
produce
them,
that
he
could
not
without
any
explanation
as
to
why
not.
the
statement
of
that
fact
would
be
sufficient
we
think
to
bring
it
to
the
committee's
contention
that
a
man
that
they
believe
could've
produced
the
record
said
he
couldn't
do
it.
now
it's
been
enough
to
the
committee
to
take
other
steps
to
claim
this
record.
for
all
the
committee
could
tell,
here
was
a
man
who
has
the
records
who
was
just
refusing
the
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
thought
that
he
had
argued
and
that
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
could
indicate
it
that
some
members
of
the
court
were
very
troubled
by
this
question
of
privilege.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think
mr.
justice
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
question
we
think
is
basically
whether
in
the
circuits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
claim
i
think
basically.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
basic
claims
as
i
understand
that
mr.
goodman
is
that
he
has
not
willfully
failed
to
produce
the
records
despite
this
refusal
to
produce
them
without
any
explanation
unless
the
government
affirmatively
show
that
he
is
in
fact
able
to
produce,
and
that
is
the
books
and
records
are
in
existence
and
that
he
is
the
custodian
or
has
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
these
documents
and
we
think
that
when
we
prove
that
the
subcommittee
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
subpoenaing
the
documents
from
him
and
that
he
in
turn
then
came
and
didn't
offer
any
explanation,
i
don't
have.
it
didn't
say
any,
he
just
said,
i
will
not
produce
it.
but
that
was
enough
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
a
willful
refusal
to
produce,
an
intentional
filing
of
the
commission
--
with
the
committee's
authority.
now,
the
cases
in
which
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
certainly
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
think
mr.
justice
that
in
the
context
that
this
case
--
that
these
are
the
two
essential
elements
of
the
crime.
we
think
if
an
issue
is
raised,
if
there
was
an
issue
raised.
if
he
denies
that
he
has
possession,
now
what
--
if
he
comes
in
and
says,
"i
don't
have
it."
that
raises
an
issue
really
as
to
whether
his
refusal
to
produce
them
was
intentional
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
the
committee.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
have
to
--
we
of
course
have
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
has
willfully
refused
to
produce
the
documents.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
the
question
really
here
is
what
the
government
has
to
prove
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
willful
refusal
to
do
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
the
--
the
only
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
only
thing
i
think
we
have
to
show
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
in
terms
of
the
statute
to
say
willful
refusal
to
produce.
the
question
is
what
elements
must
be
shown
as
part
of
our
affirmative
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
establish
this
willful
refusal
to
do
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
the
latter
two
elements
that
the
documents
are
in
existence
that
he
had
them
that
the
burden
was
shifted
to
him
to
come
forward
with
some
explanations
to
why
he
didn't
produce.
that
those
--
in
other
words
that
absent
any
challenge
by
him
and
absent
--
then
he
raised
--
by
him
of
these
questions.
those
are
not
essential
elements
to
prove
a
willful
refusal
to
produce,
that's
our
basis
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
have
were
but
there
are
cases
which
have
indicated
that
in
situations
where
certain
facts
had
shown
justify
the
inference
of
certain
conclusion
and
where
the
rebuttal
of
those
fact
lies
peculiarly
within
the
control
of
the
defendant,
that's
not
unreasonable
act
of
the
government
puts
forward
it's
affirmative
case
to
ask
the
defendant
if
he
has
an
explanation
or
excuse
to
come
forward.
i
think
the
rossi
case
which
we've
cited
with
the
prosecution
for
operating
this
still
without
a
bond.
and
i
said
that
where
the
government
to
prove
the
operation
but
still
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
affirmatively
that
the
man
had
not
obtained
a
bond.
that
was
something
within
his
knowledge
that
if
in
fact
he
hadn't
obtained
the
bond,
he
should
come
forward.
mr.
--
mr.
justice,
if
i
may
suggest
another
example
of
a
hypothetical
case
which
i
think
is
somewhat
akin
to
this.
suppose
for
the
sake
of
argument
a
witness
was
summoned
to
appear
before
a
congressional
committee
and
testified,
to
testify
that's
all.
the
day
of
his
appearance
goes
by
and
he
doesn't
even
show
up.
now
i
think
that
of
itself
ordinarily
would
be
a
clear
contempt
of
the
committee.
he
doesn't
show
up
at
all.
now
in
fact
he
may
have
a
valid
excuse.
he
may
have
been
sick
on
his
bed
in
a
hospital
on
the
day
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
it
would
it
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statute
specifically
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
statute
specifically
says
every
person
having
been
summoned
as
a
witness
by
any
committee
willfully
makes
default,
section
i,
title
2,
section
192
covers
both
failing
to
produce
documents
and
records
for
failing
to
appear
the
summon.
but
my
suggestion
was
that
in
that
case
the
government
prosecuted
this
man
under
this
statute
for
failing
to
appear.
i
would
think
the
burden
would
be
on
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
the
excuse
that
he
was
sick
in
the
hospital
on
the
day
that
he
was
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
committee.
and
yet
in
that
situation
too
i
suppose,
you
could
say
it's
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
that
he
had
the
ability
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
yet,
i
wouldn't
think
the
government
was
required
as
part
of
this
affirmative
case
to
show
that
the
man
was
healthy.
i
think
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
peculiarly
within
the
control
of
the
defendant
and
that
if
he
can
explain
it
away
he
is
obligated
to
do
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
the
burden
is
on
him.
mr.
justice,
i
suggest
that
in
the
ordinary
situation,
if
someone
is
subpoenaed
to
produce
books
and
records
before
a
committee
or
any
tribunal
and
he
is
unable
to
do
so,
he
would
normally
come
forward
and
state
so.
i
would
--
if
i
were
subpoenaed
into
one
of
the
house
committee
to
produce
some
books
and
records
of
some
organization
that
i
either
had
no
connection
or
that
i
didn't
have,
i
would
tell
them
that.
i
wouldn't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
--
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
but
i
think
the
--
it's
a
reasonable
inference
that
when
a
person
is
subpoenaed
to
produce
these
books
and
records
and
offers
no
excuse
that
this
on
its
face
seems
to
be
unintentional
clouting
the
commission's
authority
which
is
what
the
statute
prohibits.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that's
just
to
augment,
to
make
it
easier
for
congress
to
convict,
for
congress
to
punish
for
contempt,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
the
first
thing.
before
--
among
other
--
other
reasons
mr.
justice
that
the
fact
that
since
this
court
had
held
long
ago
that
co
--
congress
have
no
power
to
permit
a
recalcitrant
witness
beyond
the
expiration
of
a
session.
congress
had
discovered
just
before
the
civil
war
that
it
was
unable
effectively
to
propose
efficient
sanctions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
least
that
was
the
stated
reason.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
i
want
to
reiterate
again
a
point
that
if
petitioner
had
offered
an
excuse
to
the
subcommittee,
if
he
had
told
the
subcommittee
that
he
does
not
have
any
basis
for
not
producing,
the
subcommittee
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
pass
it
on
this
thing
which
it
was
not
given
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
when
he
just
said,
"i
will
not
produce."
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
that
situation,
the
committee
would
then
not
have
been
placed
to
this
situation
if
this
inquiry
being
blocked
of
as
a
threshold
by
reason
of
this
witness'
recalcitrant
(inaudible).
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
he
would
--
if
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
so
because
if
he
had
them,
he
didn't
have
to
say
you
had
them,
it
seems
to
me,
just
produce
them.
if
he
didn't
have
them,
a
simple
statement
that
he
didn't
have
them
would
go
to
the
question
whether
he
could
have
complied
with
the
subpoena.
and
once
he
went
beyond
that,
i
think
he
could've
stop
at
that
point.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
(inaudible)
he
didn't
--
he
wouldn't
even
have
to
see
--
he
wouldn't
have
to
explain
in
that
detail
to
just
say,
"will
you
produce
the
records?"
"i
cannot,
i
do
not
have
it."
now
i
think
when
he
has
then
asked,
"well,
why
don't
you
have
them?
do
you
know
who
has
them?
did
you
have
them
yesterday?
will
you
have
them
tomorrow?"
a
whole
series
of
questions
as
to
that,
i
think
he
could
properly
claim
this
privilege.
our
point
is
that
the
mere
statement
that
he
didn't
have
them,
the
mere
inability
to
comply
but
not
possibly
incriminate
him
and
that
would
have
given
the
committee
an
opportunity
to
take
whatever
steps
was
necessary.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
then,
if
he
said
he
didn't,
he
is
then
injected
into
the
case
on
a
question
whether
he
can
or
cannot
comply,
whether
he
had
power
to
comply
with
the
subpoena.
and
if
he
raised
that
issue
would
then
be
incumbent
on
the
government
to
come
forth
with
evidence
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
could've
produced,
but
he
raised
no
such
issue.
he
raised
no
such
issue.
but
he's
never
contented
that
he
doesn't
have
the
record.
he's
never
to
this
day
suggested
that
he
doesn't
have
the
records
of
the
(inaudible).
his
whole
argument
basically
is
that
even
though
he
said,
"i
will
not
produce
them",
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
prove
that
he
could
have
produced
them.
and
what
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
there
was
such
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
government
has
not
proved.
the
government
--
again,
if
there
was
no
such
record,
he'd
have
a
full
excuse
for
not
--
to
produce
this.
he'd
have
a
full
excuse
for
not
complying.
mr.
chief
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
didn't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now
mr.
justice,
he
lost
this
case
once
because
his
claim
of
privilege
is
invalid
insofar
as
he
personally
sought
to
claim
a
privilege
against
the
production
of
the
organization
records
and
two,
he
offered
no
other
excuse
for
not
producing.
in
other
words
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
he
didn't
say
i
don't
have
them
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
a
significant
path
whether
he
did
or
didn't
say.
we
claim
that
he
could
not
possibly
incriminate
himself
by
merely
stating,
"i
do
not
have
these
records."
he
could
not
have
been
--
it's
never
been
suggested
that
he
could
incriminate
himself
by
stating,
i
don't
have
the
records.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
several
times.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
(inaudible)
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that
means
he
was
refusing
to
answer
any
questions
with
respect
to
have
possessions
of
the
book.
i
would
like
very
briefly
now
to
refer
to
two
other
arguments
which
is
a
question
i
want
to
touch
on
with
any
--
like
of
the
breadth
of
the
subpoena
and
the
pertinency
of
the
questions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that
seems
to
be
what
the
trial
court
was
stating
but
that
statement
was
made
after
the
defendant
rested
without
introducing
any
evidence.
so
that
the
practical
matter,
he
had
not
attempted
to
introduce
any
evidence.
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
if
he
had
sought
to
justify
it
on
a
claim
of
incapacity
to
do
it,
the
trail
court
would
have
not
permitted
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
think
candidly
mr.
justice,
that
i
think
is
a
harder
question.
there
is
language
certainly
in
the
fleischman
case
which
suggest
that
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
defendant
may
introduce
evidence
showing
a
ground
for
noncompliant
with
the
subpoena.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
introduce
that
evidence,
i
suppose
if
i
were
pressed,
i
would
probably
concede
that
he
could
in
that
situation
to
introduce
evidence.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
will
prefer
not
to
if
i'm
forced
to,
i'd
say
i
would,
i
think.
because
i
think
that
if
in
fact
there
were
some
valid
grounds
for
non-production
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
then
--
that
was
not
offered.
there's
no
--
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
that
there
was
any
valid
excuse
for
non-production.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
suggesting
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
am
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it
could
--
it's
arguable.
i'm
not
attempting
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
would
--
i
--
again,
i
--
i
--
i
cannot
--
i
personally
think
that
if
he
would
be
permitted
to
introduce
that,
so
i
emphasized
that
that's
no
--
not
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
so
much,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
submitted
it
that
way
to
the
jury
in
the
face
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
face
however,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
there
was
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
issue
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
the
trial
judge
charged
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
claim
by
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
theory
that
there
was
no
issue
to
--
before
the
jury
as
to
whether
in
fact
he
had
possession
of
the
document.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
not
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
left
to
the
jury
to
decide
the
ultimate
question
of
willfulness.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
--
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
was
no
issue
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
because
under
the
statute,
he
felt
that
that
was
not
a
pertinent
issue
to
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
decided
by
the
jury.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice,
i
think
under
the
statute,
is
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
or
--
or
before
we
know
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
the
stated
reason
but
he
also
offered
no
evidence
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
before
the
jury
mr.
justice.
he
--
if
--
if
he
had
a
defense,
if
he
had
been
--
not
had
these
things,
he
could've
tendered
this
issue
before
the
jury.
he
could
then
produce
evidence
to
show
that
he
did
not
have
the
records.
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
would
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
wouldn't
think
in
a
criminal
case
the
judge
has
to
(inaudible)
possible
defenses
that
are
outraged
by
the
defense.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
that
i
don't
think
is
this
case.
i
think
the
--
the
argument
that
we
make
with
respect
to
the
need
for
bringing
these
matters
to
the
attention
of
the
committee
permeates
this
whole
case.
the
issue
with
respect
the
pertinency,
the
scope
of
the
subpoena
similarly
if
in
fact
this
man
had
any
objection
that
he
claims
the
subpoena
was
unduly
broad.
if
he
claimed
that
the
material
sought
was
not
pertinent,
again,
he
should
have
given
the
committee
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
these
things.
the
same
basic
problems
we
think
exist
with
respect
to
whether
in
fact
he
does
or
does
not
have
possession
or
custody
of
the
documents.
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
that.
we've
argued
at
length
in
our
brief
despite
it
to
say
that
if
he
thought
this
was
too
burdensome,
if
he
thought
the
subpoena
was
too
broad,
again,
he
should've
brought
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
to
the
committee's
attention
and
let
the
committee
have
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
it.
if
he
claimed
the
subpoena
was
not
--
the
documents
were
not
pertinent,
he
could
have
then
brought
it
before
the
committee
and
given
the
committee
a
chance
to
explain
to
him.
he
didn't
do
either.
we
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
barenblatt
case
indicates
quite
clearly
that
when
you
object
to
pertinency,
and
that
of
course
too
is
an
element
of
defense.
if
it's
just
the
pertinency,
you
got
to
make
the
objection
before
the
committee.
and
that
when
you
raise
no
objection
before
the
committee
on
these
particular
grounds,
in
effect
you're
telling
the
committee
you're
not
really
very
concerned
about
this.
and
then
as
we
go
on
to
prove
it
in
any
event
the
subpoena
in
this
case
was
not
unduly
broad
and
the
documents
in
view
of
the
broad
scope
that
the
commission's
inquiry
were
pertinent
to
the
investigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
he
said
it
was
not
an
issue.
he
told
that
--
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
on
page
67.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
charge
has
to
be
read
in
the
line
of
the
evidence
before
the
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
issue
in
the
case
was
whether
he
had
willfully
refused
to
produce,
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
the
indictment
charge.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
suggest
--
i
mean,
i
suggest
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
element
as
the
elements
of
whether
he
had
the
documents
and
whether
in
fact
the
documents
were
in
existence
only
need
to
be
proven
if
he
tended
some
issue
as
to
whether
as
to
whether
--
as
to
those
questions.
that
when
he
does
not
raise
any
issue
in
the
case
and
he's
never
raised
any
issue
as
to
whether
he
did
or
did
not
have
the
power
to
produce
these
documents.
that
when
that
issue
is
not
tendered,
that
its
never
been
tendered
in
this
case,
that
there's
no
need
for
the
government
to
(inaudible)
this
thing.
i
want
--
i'd
like
to
close
on
this
note
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
there's
never
been
any
contention
in
this
case
by
the
petitioner
that
he
did
not
have
the
document
whether
the
documents
had
not
existed.
he's
never
made
that
contention
at
any
point
in
this
proceeding.
this
whole
contention
has
been
that
even
though
he
refused
to
produce
the
documents
without
any
explanation,
the
burden
was
upon
the
government
to
affirmatively
establish
that
he
could've
produced.
now
we
thinking
in
the
normal
situation
when
someone
is
subpoenaed
to
produce
documents,
it's
a
reasonable
inference
that
if
he
had
an
excuse
for
not
producing,
he
would
have
said
so.
and
in
these
circumstances,
we
don't
think
the
government
was
required
to
affirmatively
establish
that
policy.
thank
you.
