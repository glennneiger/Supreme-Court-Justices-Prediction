justice

frankfurter
what
was
the
date
of
the
original
hearing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
the
citation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
interested
in
why
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
it's
not
through
the
indictment.
the
case
has
been
tried
for
two
and
a
half
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
motions
by
you
for
delay?
justice
felix
frankfurter
any
bill
of
particulars?
anything
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
brought
you
down
--
that
brings
you
down
to
assist
the
court
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
long
was
it
tried?
justice
felix
frankfurter
two
days.
justice
felix
frankfurter
thus,
four
years
since
they
entered
the
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
the
appeal
is
not
--
meaning
the
appeal
is
not
required
by
the
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
want
to
avoid
or
introduce
the
conclusion
which
you
avoid.
was
that
a
separate
record
meaning,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
not
in
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
us?
i
mean
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
pertinent
to
our
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
other
--
was
there
any
other
witness?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
petitioner
didn't
--
nobody
on
his
behalf?
you
were
right
and
in
other
words,
on
the
government's
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justification
of
any
office
in
there
has
held?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
transcript
--
the
full
transcript
of
the
proceedings
before
the
committed
or
subcommittee
is
there
as
well,
introduced
the
evidence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
from
that,
nothing
appeared
as
to
take
the
existence
of
documents
or
books
and
record
and
be
the
relation
of
the
petitioner
to
those
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
i
ask
you
this
mr.
goodman?
suppose
the
committee
or
the
congress
issued
me
--
a
subpoena
to
me,
directing
me
to
produce
(inaudible)
the
xyz
corporation
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
the
government
doesn't
prove
anything
except
that
i
stand
(inaudible)
the
congress
has
the
statute
to
say
that
anybody
subpoenaed
or
guilty
for
the
committee
of
congress,
authorized
to
make
an
investigation
in
putting
up
--
putting
from
one
side
all
the
questions
(inaudible).
there's
no
reason
that
it's
not
done
(inaudible)
do
you
think
that
could
be
violated
for
the
constitution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
that.
but
i
say
no,
i
won't
introduce
these
records.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
couldn't
require
that
the
man
has
been
subpoenaed,
i
could
say,
and
i
couldn't
require
that
demand
in
subpoena
should
say
i
never
heard
of
that
corporation,
you've
got
the
wrong
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
the
improvised
(inaudible).
you
think
that
if
the
committee
of
congress
has
got
a
subpoena
and
asked
you
to
produce
certain
records
which
the
constitution
so
circumscribe
my
pleading
to
let
alone
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
enclosed
upon
me
saying,
you've
got
the
wrong
man.
do
you
think
--
that's
what
the
constitution
protected
me.
that
is
--
that
is
exactly
too
much
of
me
with
reference
to
other
(inaudible)
the
congress
of
united
states
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
didn't
have
to
say
yes
if
it's
going
to
incriminate
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
not
my
case.
i'm
not
invoking
the
privilege
against
self
incrimination
because
of
the
danger
involved
in
there.
i
invoke
it
because
i
don't
have
anything
to
do
with
it,
so
that
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
case
i
put
wasn't
between
(inaudible)
then
you're
going
to
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
then
would
have
to
say
i
would
answer
that
question
because
if
i
did
answer,
you'd
have
to
say
why
you've
got
the
wrong
man.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
point
here
is
that
(inaudible).
there
must
be
some
showing
that
--
of
producibility.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
they
impliedly
admitted
that
he's
got
the
record
but
won't
produce
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
does
the
court
decide
on
what's
the
ruling
on
thisw
(inaudible).
i
beg
your
pardon
--
charged
to
the
jury.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
government
stand
on
this
trial?
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
stand.
justice
felix
frankfurter
here,
they
defend
the
legal
record
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
words
presumption
and
shifting
and
burden
(inaudible)
but
isn't
that
what
this
charge
says.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
charge
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
court
said
that
that
implied
--
that
should
have
been
(inaudible)
if
he
didn't
have
issue
specifically.
isn't
that
--
that's
then
cast
out
as
a
term
or
presumption
which
have
occurred.
is
that
what
this
is
about
that
there
is
enough
there
from
the
jury
that
if
he
were
to
say
and
have
reasons
for
not
delivering
them
and
told
he
didn't
have
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
know
how
far
it
goes
but
you
did
not
answer
what
court
has
charged,
meaning,
at
that
time
even
if
you
have
a
good
reason
for
not
refusing
at
that
time.
so
if
a
man
may
have
a
good
reason
for
not
producing
them
at
that
time,
it
may
have
been
erroneous.
there
may
have
been
a
little
misapprehension.
i
think
(inaudible)
some
documents
are
not
in
my
possession
and
even
told
you
if
they
are
in
my
possession.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
you
can
(inaudible)
that.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
petitioner
does
not
put
either
affirmatively
the
denial
by
the
trial
judge
or
the
denial
of
the
district
judge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
see
why
you
skipped
the
next
question
in
the
(inaudible)
--
have
in
those
remarks
in
answer.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
get
out
of
that
is
that
he
has
no
other
answer
except
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
--
i
don't
quite
(inaudible)
go
back
to
page
31.
i
refuse
to
answer
this
or
any
question
(inaudible)
in
the
record
or
to
the
subpoena.
i
claim
my
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
then
it's
the
word,
after
you
(inaudible)
mr.
tavenner,
i
would
like
to
ask
(inaudible)
there's
any
other
(inaudible)
in
the
subpoena.
i
think
my
answer
is
covered.
now,
if
i
were
not
then
the
(inaudible)
and
because
of
my
possession,
i
would
get
out
of
here
(inaudible)
that
he
had
standing,
he
had
on
the
privilege
of
getting
self-incrimination,
the
record
to
every
question
that
he
was
asked?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
his
answer
to
every
question.
have
you
got
any
other
reason?
now,
for
me
that
means
he
has
no
other
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
he
didn't
say
he
hasn't
got
them.
that
he
doesn't
want
to
produce
any
sort
of
claims
by
fifth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
me?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
come
to
something
else
and
i
don't
--
do
not
want
to
dislocate
your
argument.
now
i
fully
understand
at
least,
not
mine
to
decide
it,
sure
enough
to
answer
my
question,
(inaudible)
what
i
want
to
know
is
this.
coming
across
all
this
--
all
the
close
interpretations
that
you
might
want
to
--
do
you
have
a
right
to
make
because
i
take
that
what
you're
here
to
make.
i
want
to
ask
you
this.
assume
he
did
claim
--
assumed
that
he
properly,
adequately
invoked
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
to
the
productions
of
books,
these
records
rather,
could
he
make
that
claim?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
why
don't
you
argue
that?
that
would
be
(inaudible)
of
putting
these
words
under
a
microscope.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
show
me
a
lot.
that
that
answer
(inaudible)
of
mr.
tavenner,
if
that's
his
name.
does
this
mean,
in
obtaining
these
--
stretching
the
whole
context,
(inaudible),
it
doesn't
mean
when
you
search
--
when
you
produce
them,
he
said,
"i
claim
this
privilege
of
the
fifth
amendment."
justice
felix
frankfurter
he'd
have
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
for
a
great
deal
of
persuading
that
(inaudible)
that
policy
means?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
if
that,
if
you're
right
about
that,
that's
an
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
well,
i
should
think
for
me
it's
the
end
of
the
case
because
of
the
answer,
i
have
no
other
excuse
except
that.
he
doesn't
have
the
excuse
for
not
having
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
i
think
(inaudible)
closely
to
mr.
goodman,
(inaudible)
yet
i
may
have
missed
but
he
isn't
arguing
here
that
he
was
protected
by
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
that
isn't
the
argument
here.
your
argument
states
that
it
isn't
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
that's
a
different
story.
all
i'm
saying
is
the
claim
here,
that
the
issue
here
is
whether
there
was
a
proof
by
the
government
under
its
duty
of
proof
that
these
records
are
traced
to
these
individuals
and
therefore
he
was
not
then
entitled
to
not
produce
them.
and
so
that's
the
burden
of
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
maybe
--
and
when
for
me,
when
a
man
is
asked,
"can
you
produce
them?
he
says,
"i
claim
the
privilege",
he
negated
all
other
reasons
for
withholding
proof
predominantly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
word
of
that
in
the
brief
of
this,
doesn't
it?
there's
none
of
the
(inaudible)
he
doesn't
claim,
that's
a
different
--
that
was
beyond
totally
different
problem
namely
that
he
was
at
no
time
so
pressed
or
so
add
that
he
couldn't
claim
this
privilege
against
self-incrimination
under
the
view
of
his
relation
of
being
asked
to
produce
some
other
(inaudible)
doctrine.
and
that
thing
--
that
wouldn't
be
a
good
claim.
all
i'm
saying,
i
don't
find
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
your
answer
to
that
isn't
in
the
litigation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
somehow
rather
with
these
documents?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
of
this
prosecution
was
under
the
old
section
(inaudible)
the
old
statute
which
congress
--
the
reason
(inaudible)
by
which
congress
had
(inaudible)
on
to
the
court
making
it
a
criminal
offence
and
saving
them
from
direct
(inaudible)
from
direct
citations
to
contempt
as
--
so
far
as
the
house
of
the
senate,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
to
make
it
easier
to
prevent
them
from
doing
the
--
the
punishing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
up
to
that
time,
it
had
to
be
done
by
congress
itself
(inaudible)
district
jail
whatever
was
(inaudible)
by
congress
itself.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
don't
suppose
there's
any
doubt
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
--
they
passed
this
statute
whereby
automatic,
automatic.
we've
got
the
courts
to
do
what
they're
supposed
they
had
to
do,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
for
various
(inaudible)
because
these
commitments,
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
they
--
they
didn't
want
go
and
just
decided
that
opinion,
let
go
(inaudible)
the
judiciary.
justice
felix
frankfurter
supposing
--
suppose
he
had
said
any
number
of
things?
suppose
he
said,
"i
don't
produce
because
i
think
(inaudible)
i
don't
produce
them
because
i
think
(inaudible)
finished
unconstitutional
and
it
is
a
disgrace
to
americanism.
i
don't
produce
them
because
in
other
reasons,
not
remotely
related
to
anything
except
he
refused
to
produce
records
without
the
slightest
intimation
and
indeed
of
(inaudible)
claim,
rational
implications
that
those
are
the
reasons
he
gives
not
the
reason
he
doesn't
give.
justice
felix
frankfurter
could
you
therefore
say
that
entirely
he
didn't
mean
any
of
these
things
particularly
when
he
had
a
lawyer
to
accomplish
(inaudible)
defense
to
this
court.
how
many
times
did
he
claim
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
i
have
encountered
them
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
15
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only,
that's
insinuated.
that
means
nothing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
--
are
you
taking
the
contention
that
he
--
that
he
shut
off
at
the
trial
because
he
gave
no
--
because
of
what
happened
at
the
--
before
the
committee?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
mr.
goodman
or
mr.
crockett
had
said,
i'd
like
to
explain
why
he
didn't
produce
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
--
can
you
think
of
any
justification
for
shutting
off
the
defendant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
asking
whether
it's
arguable,
(inaudible)
i
want
to
know
whether
you
with
your
responsibility
to
say
that
if
you
shut
off
(inaudible)
put
against
such
a
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
a
different
story
than
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
whether
with
your
responsibility
not
just
as
an
individual
having
a
private
meeting
whether
you
are
here
to
say
that
if
at
this
trial,
no
matter
what
position,
no
matter
--
taking
the
record
as
we
have
it,
if
at
the
trial,
an
offer
has
been
made
to
explain
why
he
didn't
produce
them.
would
you
say
that
he'd
be
shut
off
in
making
that
defense?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
the
jury
had
passed
on
anything,
could
a
jury,
even
a
criminal
jury,
would
it
be
proper
for
a
trial
judge
to
submit
(inaudible)
to
a
jury
that
hasn't
been
established
or
haven't
been
intended
or
haven't
even
suggested
as
to
which
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
for
him
to
guide
the
jury
about.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
the
charges
of
putting
the
abstract
to
juries
or
issues
they
dealt
with
in
the
abstract
after
the
jury
gets
through
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
a
murder
case,
this
--
there's
no
suggestion
of
the
self-defense,
would
it
be
error
for
a
judge
not
be
charged
--
not
to
tell
the
jury
of
course
if
we
find
you
--
this
is
actually
self-defense,
(inaudible)
convict
him
of
murder
in
the
first
degree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
