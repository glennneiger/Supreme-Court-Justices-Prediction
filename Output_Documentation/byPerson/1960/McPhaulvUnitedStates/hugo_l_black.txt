(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
the
government
read
impart
through
the
record
(inaudible)
in
the
basis
of
the
facts
the
committee
has
heard
facts
from
somebody
that
led
them
to
believe
that
there
was
such
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
said
that
was
pertinency.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
the
government
insisting
that
any
of
that
can
be
used
for
the
purpose
of
proving
there
were
records?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
do
it
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
understand
(inaudible)
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
saying
(inaudible)
the
committee
had
made
something
(inaudible)
and
found
out
that
they
have
reason
to
believe
that
there
were
papers
(inaudible)
that
this
man
was
an
officer
(inaudible)
and
that
you
can
take
that
with
his
refusal
to
answer
prima
facie
evidence
that
they
did
have
(inaudible)
of
prima
facie
evidence
that
they
did
have
papers
telling
he
was
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
--
that
was
--
they're
using
it
to
prove
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can
understand
that
if
you
open
that
as
a
basis
for
showing
that
it
shouldn't
challenge
the
subpoena
being
(inaudible)
it
could
but
not
to
prove
anything
on
which
they
make
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
against
him
in
a
trial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
--
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
where
--
whether
they
had
a
reason
or
basis
that
when
you
charged
him
for
the
willful
failure
to
produces
papers
and
the
presumption
i
suppose
some
(inaudible)
of
the
case
that
we
had
to
take
him
and
had
some
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
you
return
each
time
when
you're
talking
about
the
evidence
against
him
to
prove
that
there
were
papers
and
that
he
had
it.
you
return
each
time
to
what
was
plainly
history
in
a
trial
where
the
man
with
a
criminal
case,
after
what
the
committee
had
heard.
you
return
each
time.
if
you
leave
that
out,
what
is
the
evidence
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
leaving
out
the
evidence
--
leaving
out
of
the
key
statement
that
senator
potter
and
the
committee
had
heard
from
somebody
else.
what
is
the
basis
of
your
proof
in
the
charge
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
no
reason
to
proceed,
and
we
charge
him
of
refusing
to
bring
paper
that
--
and
you
prove
that
he
had
the
paper,
that
he
was
an
officer,
having
been
charged
and
that
he
refused
to
bring,
and
then
you
would
prove
he's
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
any
different
whether
they
had
a
reasonable
basis
so
far
as
his
guilt
was
concern
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
understand
--
suppose
i
--
i
can't
understand
the
problem,
it's
just
(inaudible)
because
i
understand
you,
that
you're
saying
that
(inaudible)
by
his
statement
to
the
committee,
(inaudible)
to
the
committee,
that
i
refuse
to
(inaudible)on
the
grounds
that
--
i
refuse
to
(inaudible)
would
that
amount
as
confession
on
his
part
of
two
essentials
elements
of
the
offense
to
which
he
was
charged?
first,
that
there
are
such
papers
(inaudible)
and
second,
that
the
he
is
an
officer
or
has
some
part
(inaudible)
but
now,
i
don't
see
how
that
would
be
helpful
when
the
fact
if
the
committee
has
reasonable
grounds
that
he
should've
produced
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
believe
that
in
a
criminal
case,
i
--
i
don't
suppose
you
believe
that
they
could've
waived
this
(inaudible)
to
prove
this
charges
of
a
criminal
(inaudible)
of
what
he
said
before
the
committee,
could
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
then
if
he
don't,
this
is
admissible
if
it's
a
confession
of
two
essential
elements
of
the
crime
but
do
you
believe
that
those
two
essential
elements
of
the
crime
can
establish
beyond
a
--
or
can
be
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
such
a
attenuated
inference
as
it
must
be
drawn
for
the
statement
of
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
asked
by
the
committee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
--
the
law
should
be
--
it's
a
different
thing.
it's
an
indictment
for
a
crime.
and
this
has
to
be
filed
what
takes
place
in
the
court
and
under
a
long
established
use
of
evidence
in
other
types
of
cases
that
evidence
has
to
be
proven
not
by
hearsay
but
by
evidence.
and
you
don't
think
it's
in
a
--
(inaudible)
to
measure,
to
prove
that
the
way
you
have
to
prove
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
of
course,
if
it
--
if
he
had
made
the
statement,
no
once
could
deny
that
he
made
the
statement
before
the
committee.
that
wouldn't
have
been
waived
as
i
see
it.
now,
i
have
those
(inaudible)
and
i
could
produce
but
i'm
not
going
to
do
it.
(inaudible)
then
i
suppose
there'd
be
no
doubt
that
it
had
to
be
offered
as
a
confession
even
though
that
he
was
not
in
open
court.
but
here,
you
have
to
--
(inaudible)
problem
to
mean
is
if
its
to
mean
what
he
says
that
the
--
that
he
--
could
that
lead
to
his
burden
of
proof
as
to
why
in
to
these
charges
not
to
require
that
the
--
it
should
be
--
not
have
been
given
even
as
to
that
in
the
case,
the
basis
on
which
the
government
as
to
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
of
the
prima
facie
cases
in
a
criminal
court
where
you
just
have
to
allege
things
in
the
indictment
and
it's
essential
to
the
conviction
unless
they
make
out
a
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
as
a
whole?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you've
got
to
show
how
we
do
that.
this
identical
question
was
presented
to
the
jury,
i
suppose.
and
so
whether
they
could
find
even
if
they
find
(inaudible)
whether
they
could
find
here,
number
one,
that
the
presumption,
number
two,
it
is
prima
facie
in
here
to
refuse
(inaudible)
and
he
could've
brought
them.
and
they
didn't.
but
all
those
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury
in
some
way,
wouldn't
it?
you
couldn't
go
simply
on
the
basis
that
we
had
before
the
committee
taken
some
(inaudible)
made
it
unnecessary
to
prove
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
--
there'd
been
a
lot
of
talk
about
shifting
the
burden
specifically
so
that
the
plaintiff
(inaudible)
to
say
the
least
of
it,
the
courts
have
been
rather
weary
haven't
they
about
adopting
the
rule
of
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
government
to
defendant
charged
with
a
crime?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
undoubtedly
would
be
a
valid
contempt
to
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
does
it
--
would
that
be
covered
by
the
federal
statute
against
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
my
--
does
my
--
i'm
just
wondering,
there's
a
difference
of
course.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
contempt
there
would
be
that
he
had
failed
to
the
congress.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
the
statute
may
cover
that
but
it
--
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
are
saying
that
even
if
you
cannot
draw
the
inference
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
suggested,
you
could
be
wrong
in
making
that
i
refuse
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination.
you're
saying
--
and
even
if
he
couldn't
draw
that,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
because
the
burden
is
on
him
to
show
that
there
were
no
papers
and
that
--
and
that
he
was
not
connected
with
somebody
that
he
couldn't
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can't
go
off
in
that
statement
to
determine
or
to
make
out
a
case
against
you,
wouldn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
you
are
doing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
you're
saying
now
is
(inaudible)
covered
in
this
contempt
cases
that
they
find
yourself
waiving
every
(inaudible)
before
you
know
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
if
that
--
if
that's
true,
the
full
effect
of
what
you
had
(inaudible)
by
claiming
his
privilege
of
self-incrimination
doing
no
more
(inaudible)
the
charge
with
the
failure
to
produce
papers
if
he
had
them
without
proof
that
he
had
ever
had
the
papers.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
did
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
--
he
lost
(inaudible)
because
he
claimed
his
privilege
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
that's
the
only
statement
you
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you
assume
with
that
argument
is
(inaudible)
and
he
claimed
his
privilege,
could
that
amount
to
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
refusal
to
(inaudible)
ask
him
why
he
didn't
raise
that
claim,
that
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment?
then
you
say
by
that,
you
could
subject
him
although
if
he
had
said,
i
don't
have
them,
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
of
course
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
trial
court
did
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
the
way
he
submitted
it
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
right.
and
then
that's
what
he's
charged
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
any
face
of
any
kind.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
that
this
issue
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
say
that
whether
the
records
and
documents
as
he
mentioned
in
the
subpoena
were
actually
just
(inaudible)
the
prevention
of
(inaudible)
of
defendant.
because
if
the
defendant
had
a
legitimate
reason
for
failing
to
produce
said
records,
he
should
state
it
as
reason
for
noncompliance
to
the
subpoena
when
you
fail
--
before
the
subcommittee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
even
when
he
refused
charges,
it
would've
shown
that
the
papers
do
not
exist
because
they
haven't
proven
that
they
did
exist.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
come
talking
about
the
claim
but
what
in
this
case
they
submitted
to
the
jury
on
--
precisely
the
basis
of
that
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
gave
the
general
charge
on
that
issue
in
effect,
it
was
--
was
a
civil
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
he
leave
anything
to
the
jury
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
suppose
that,
do
you
mean
then
that
--
that
this
implied
confession
from
this
input,
one
sentence,
this
implied
confession
that
he
had
the
paper,
he
could've
produced
them
but
didn't,
that
gives
the
court
to
deprive
the
jury
of
submitting
that
issue
to
the
jury
entirely.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
didn't
to
--
what
--
the
indictment
charge
did
and
the
only
evidence
you
had
to
prove
it
if
you
had
any
was
the
fact
that
he
had
said,
"i
refuse
to
answer
on
the
ground
of
self-incrimination."
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
wanted
charges
to
submit
to
the
jury
on
whether
or
not
there
was
proof
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
declined
to
give
it,
didn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
no.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
he
felt
that
there
was
no
issue,
that
wouldn't
have
been
a
defense
because
he
didn't
raise
it
before
the
committee.
justice
hugo
l.
black
wasn't
that
the
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
wouldn't
that
--
that's
about
the
time
(inaudible)
that
the
government
were
so
sure
that
he
was
an
officer
that
it's
so
easy
that
the
committee
(inaudible)
that
they
might
have
suggest
--
they
might
have
suggested
to
the
court
that
he
was
(inaudible)
he
was
an
officer.
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
suppose
they
offered
tending
to
the
confession?
this
man
said
yes,
he
--
i
--
i
killed
him
over
his
(inaudible)
can
the
court
then
charge
the
jury
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
decided
by
whether
his
guilty
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
also
it
might
raise
the
question
of
what
inference
(inaudible)
in
fact,
the
case
might
(inaudible)
