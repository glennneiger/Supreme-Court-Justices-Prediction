mr.
ernest
goodman
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
this
is
a
certiorari
from
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
a
conviction
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
for
contempt
of
the
house
committee
on
un-american
activities.
the
petitioner
was
subpoenaed
by
a
subcommittee
of
the
house
committee
in
february
1952
in
detroit
to
appear
on
february
27th
of
that
year.
he
was
subpoenaed
in
his
own
name,
arthur
mcphaul,
and
the
subpoena
called
for
him
to
bring
certain
records
of
the
civil
rights
congress.
he
appeared
before
the
committee
with
an
attorney
and
in
response
to
a
number
of
questions
directed
to
him
by
a
counsel
for
the
committee.
he
claimed
the
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment
upon
being
pressed
by
the
attorney
for
the
committee
as
to
whether
he
would
produce
the
records
sought
by
the
subpoena.
his
final
answer
was
"i
will
not".
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
he
did.
following
that,
a
citation
was
issued
by
congress
and
an
indictment
was
issued
in
july
of
1954
on
which
the
petitioner
was
arraigned.
mr.
ernest
goodman
february
1952,
the
indictment
was
issued
two
and
a
half
years
later.
mr.
ernest
goodman
citation
was
at
some
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
it
took
two
and
a
half
years
for
the
indictment
and
then
two
and
a
half
years
for
the
trial.
i
only
asked
for
that
is
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
though
i
was
just
waiting
for
the
government
to
act
and
i
assumed
they
didn't
act
because
they
were
apprehensive
of
the
nature
of
the
case
they
had.
it
might
only
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
have
filed
a
motion
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
filed
a
--
i
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
argued
expeditiously
and
determined
against
me
but
it
didn't
hold
up
the
matter
very
long.
i
just
have
no
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right,
december
1956
when
the
trial
took
place
before
judge
freedman
and
the
jury.
mr.
ernest
goodman
two
days.
mr.
ernest
goodman
there
was
one
witness
presented
by
the
government
and
there
were
no
other
witnesses.
mr.
ernest
goodman
four
years,
almost
four
years
since
they
entered
the
trial.
i
can't
account
for
that
on
anything
done
on
my
part.
it's
just
that
the
government,
i
think,
does
not
press
the
matter
for
reasons
of
its
own.
i
am
sure
that
every
time
i
was
called
upon
to
argue
this
case,
but
not
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
would
say
in
this
case,
the
government
did
not
--
did
not
seek
a
speedy
determination
of
this
case.
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
defense
tactic
at
all.
i
was
in
the
case
(inaudible).
the
trial
itself
consisted
of
the
following.
the
government
introduced
in
evidence
through
a
single
witness,
the
following
facts.
first,
that
the
committee
has
been
lawfully
constituted.
second
that
the
subpoena
have
been
issued
by
this
subcommittee
also
lawfully
constitute
upon
mr.
mcphaul
that
he
had
appeared
before
the
subcommittee
that
he
had
used
the
fifth
amendment
with
respect
to
a
number
of
questions
and
that
finally
he
had
answered
in
order
to
produce
the
record,
"i
will
not".
and
that
the
congress
had
duly
and
properly
cited
him
for
contempt.
this
was
all
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
at
the
trial
before
the
jury.
there
was
other
evidence
introduced
on
a
separate
record
dealing
only
with
the
issue
of
pertinency,
since
i
think
it
would
be
confusing
to
bring
in
those
facts
at
this
point
of
my
argument,
i
would
prefer
to
present
the
facts
introduced
on
its
separate
record
dealing
with
pertinency
when
i
make
the
argument
concerning
pertinency.
mr.
ernest
goodman
meaning
the
jury
was
excused.
the
government
requested
that
a
separate
record
on
the
issue
of
pertinency
be
made
in
view
of
the
decision
of
this
court
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
that
--
that
record
dealing
with
the
issue
of
pertinency
is
a
part
of
the
record
that's
before
you
from
pages
13
to
29.
that
is
the
--
when
i
say
separate
record,
what
i
mean
is
that
it
was
taken
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
senator
potter
who
at
that
time
was
a
congressman,
member
of
the
subcommittee.
through
him,
all
of
the
various
records
showing
the
constitution
of
the
committee
and
the
legality
of
the
action
appointing
the
subcommittee
and
then
citing
the
petitioner
was
introduced
together
with
a
certain
portion
of
the
transcript
of
testimony
taken
before
the
subcommittee.
it
was
all
introduced
through
the
one
witness
without
any
objection.
that
testimony
took
a
very
short
time.
if
you
will
read
the
record,
you
will
note
that
most
of
it,
the
argument,
consists
of
legal
argument
and
matters
relating
to
the
separate
record
--
record
on
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
no
other
witness.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
as
soon
as
the
government
presented
this
testimony,
the
defendant
rested,
introduced
no
evidence
and
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
of
"not
guilty"
was
made
orally
by
myself,
argued
and
we
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
in
discussing
it.
the
judge
issued
an
oral
opinion
which
appears
in
the
record
on
--
beginning
with
page
54
of
the
transcript.
i
want
to
emphasize
advising
the
court
as
to
what
evidence
was
introduced
by
the
government
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
kind
of
the
existence
of
the
record
sought
by
the
subpoena,
no
evidence
of
any
relationship
between
the
petitioner
here
and
the
civil
rights
congress
that
this
record
was
sought.
there
is
nothing
at
all
in
this
record
taking
before
the
jury
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
no.
the
government
sought
to
present
evidence
in
that
area
by
offering
exhibit
9
and
because
it
was
unable
to
do
so
to
any
witness
who
could
identify
the
petitioner
as
being
the
person
who
allegedly
was
an
officer
of
the
organization.
the
exhibit
was
objected
by
the
trial
court,
so
that
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
kind
on
those
two
facts.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no.
no
record
--
no
evidence
that
were
ever
any
such
record
in
any
such
organization
ever
in
existence
nor
any
evidence
that
the
petitioner
has
anything
to
do
with
any
such
records
if
they
ever
were
in
existence.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
the
government
only
introduced
portions
of
that
matter.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
correct.
there's
nothing
in
that
transcript
which
is
part
of
the
record
before
the
jury
that
contains
any
such
information.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
if
that
were
to
justify
the
inference,
he
has
possession
of
the
documents,
of
course
that
will
be
it
as
i
will
come
to
that
in
the
argument.
on
the
motion
for
directed
verdict,
the
trial
court
held,
agreed
with
the
position
that
i
will
state
here
now,
that
there
were
no
such
evidence,
but
he
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
introduce
any
such
evidence,
nor
in
fact,
could
the
issue
even
be
litigated
at
the
trial
at
all,
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner,
when
he
appeared
before
the
committee,
did
not
make
an
explanation
before
the
committee
as
to
the
records
which
he
was
directed
to
bring.
it
was
the
trial
court's
opinion
that
under
circumstances
where
a
person
is
subpoenaed
to
bring
in
records
of
an
organization.
he
must
make
an
explanation
if
he
does
not
bring
the
records
as
to
why
he
does
not
bring
them
or
as
to
whether
he
has
them
or
not.
some
explanation
is
required
in
the
absence
of
that,
it
foreclosed
from
raising
the
issue
at
the
trial
and
the
government
may
not
--
must
not
have
to
introduce
any
other,
the
court
said
they
did
not
hear.
the
court
relied
on
the
bryan
and
fleischman
cases
to
support
his
position.
and
before
i
discuss
those
two
cases,
which
i
think
is
crucial
to
this
decision
here.
i
want
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
i
filed
a
request
to
charge,
which
appeared
in
the
transcript
on
page
74
after
he
overruled
my
motion
for
directed
verdict
that
the
jury
be
constructed,
that
they
have
to
find
that
there
were
records
in
existence
and
that
the
defendant
of
the
case
had
the
possession
of
it
all
--
of
them.
and
the
--
the
court
did
not
give
the
charge.
he
rejected
it
and
instead
he
gave
a
charge
which
on
page
67
of
the
transcript
told
the
jury
that
they
were
not
to
concern
themselves
with
whether
the
defendant
have
the
record
or
whether
there
were
any
records
in
existence
or
whether
he,
the
defendant,
had
any
relationship
to
the
civil
rights
congress,
because
not
having
and
made
an
explanation
before
the
committee
that
he
could
not
present
the
matter
in
the
court.
and
the
jury
was
in
fact,
advise
that
they
could
determine,
but
without
any
relationship
to
existence
or
possession
of
record
whether
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
willfully
refusing
to
produce
the
records
before
the
committee
and
in
fact,
i
think
it
was
a
charge
almost
or
a
directed
verdict
because
no
other
issues
in
the
case
were
in
dispute
here
and
everything
else
was
conceded.
now,
that
comes
to
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
the
bryan
and
fleischman
decision.
in
bryan
and
fleischman,
this
court
held
that
where
a
witness
appeared
before
a
congressional
committee
for
the
purpose
of
using
records
called
for
by
subpoenaing
and
did
not
produce
the
records.
but
later,
when
brought
to
trial
for
contempt,
the
witness
sought
to
raise
the
issue
of
lack
of
a
quorum
before
the
committee
at
the
time
the
witness
appeared
there
that
the
witness
would
not
be
permitted
to
raise
that
issue
at
the
contempt
of
trial,
because
the
witness
had
not
advised
the
committee
at
the
time
of
her
appearance
of
her
claim
of
lack
of
a
quorum.
now,
it
is
our
position
here
that
if
the
bryan
and
fleischman
--
that
the
bryan
and
fleishcman
rule
applied
--
as
applied
by
this
court,
in
the
situation
where
the
claim
may
dealt
with
a
procedural
matter.
the
question
of
a
quorum
or
the
lack
of
a
quorum
was
a
procedural
matter
and
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
or
in
those
cases
not
having
raise
the
procedural
issue
which
the
committee
had
a
right
or
was
in
a
position
to
resolve
or
correct
at
the
time
of
the
appearance,
could
not
be
later
raised
as
a
defense
of
a
trial.
but
we
think
that
it
is
extending
the
rule
far
beyond
the
intent
of
the
court
in
announcing
it
in
the
first
place
and
would
if
applied
to
a
situation
like
this,
take
away
for
the
defendants
in
a
criminal
action.
the
presumption
of
innocence
to
apply
it
to
several
--
to
eliminate,
to
the
essential
elements
in
the
proof
of
guilt
in
this
case,
because
to
prove
the
defendant
guilty
of
willfully
refusing
or
failing
to
produce
records,
two
of
the
elements
in
that
case,
which
have
been
held
in
many
decisions
of
this
court
to
be
essential
elements
of
the
crime.
first,
that
there
are
such
records
in
existence
and
second,
that
the
defendant
was
in
a
position
to
produce
and
did
not
do
so.
and
yet,
by
using
the
rule
announced
in
bryan
and
fleischman
with
respect
to
a
procedural
point,
standing
to
two
of
the
essential
elements
in
the
crime,
i
think
the
court
has
--
the
court
felt
or
the
law
must
concede
to
hold
purpose
of
contempt
to
bryan
and
fleischman
and
would
be
drafted
into
the
criminal
law
to
a
rather
noble
and
new
and
far-reaching
concept
by
which
a
person
could
wave
his
rights
to
a
trial
by
jury
with
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
burden
upon
the
government
to
prove
the
essential
grounds
of
a
crime.
now,
the
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
no.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
think
it's
not
by
anything
that
was
said,
because
no
offer
to
introduce
in
the
evidence
is
made.
but
if
the
court
will
read
from
the
trial
court's
decision
in
denying
the
motion
for
directed
verdict
and
compare
--
it
appears
on
page
61
of
the
transcript
of
record.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
court's
rationale
was
same
--
is
the
same
as
this
court
in
bryan
and
fleischman.
that
is
that
when
the
witness
appears
before
a
committee,
it
is
necessary
at
that
time
to
make
an
objection
or
to
make
an
explanation
so
as
to
give
the
committee
at
that
time
an
opportunity
of
correcting
the
defect
or
irregularity,
and
the
court
so
said.
and
therefore,
the
court
said,
in
this
case,
mcphaul
when
he
appeared
before
the
committee,
should
have
made
an
explanation
concerning
the
records
with
their
existence
or
whether
he
have
them
or
whether
he
was
related
to
the
civil
rights
congress,
because
if
he
had
done
so,
the
trial
court
said,
then
the
committee
could
have
done
something
else
to
find
those
records.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
i
think
that
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
because
after
all
the
trial
took
place
two
and
a
half
years
after
it
appeared
before
the
committee
and
the
court's
reasoning
and
logic
was
correct.
it
wouldn't
help
the
committee
very
much
for
him
to
prove
at
the
trial
two
and
a
half
years
later,
that
he
didn't
have
the
record
or
where
the
records
could
be
found,
because
the
committee
was
thinking
to
find
those
records
two
and
half
years
earlier.
so
i
think
the
whole
rationale
of
the
court's
decision
based
upon
bryan
and
fleischman
who
have
said
exactly
the
same
thing
well,
that
you
couldn't
litigate
the
issue
at
all
of
the
trial.
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
it
was
made
after
--
after
we
had
rest
with
our
case
and
without
introducing
him
yet.
but
i
think
that
it
is
also
clear
with
respect
to
this
matter
that
if
the
court
was
of
the
view
that
this
was
a
matter
of
substantive
proof
and
that
the
issue
could
be
litigated
at
the
trial,
the
court
would've
allowed
the
matter
to
go
to
the
jury
for
determination
as
a
jury
question.
and
i
think
logically
from
his
point
of
view,
he
did
not
permit
it
to
go
to
the
jury
even
though
he
requested
that
would
be
done
after
he
denied
our
motion
to
dismiss.
it
was
logical
from
his
point
of
view
because
his
position
was
he
couldn't
even
be
litigated
to
file.
therefore,
the
jury
couldn't
determine
the
issue
whether
there
were
more
or
less
facts.
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
through
the
entire
issue
for
consideration
from
the
jury.
now,
the
government
in
its
brief
here
on
appeal,
does
not
accept
this
rationale
of
the
trial
court
nor
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
form
down
the
same
ground
on
defining
bryan
and
fleischman.
as
i
understand
the
government's
argument
here,
it
is
that
while
it
is
true,
the
government
says
that
a
witness
owes
a
duty
for
the
committee
when
subpoenaed
before
to
present
some
kind
of
an
explanation
with
respect
to
the
records
where
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
issuing
the
subpoena
and
for
believing
that
the
person
to
whom
the
subpoena
is
issued,
could
bring
the
record.
that
at
that
point,
assuming
there
is
in
the
record
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
to
this
particular
person,
the
government
argues
then
the
burden
shifts
at
the
trial
to
the
defendant
at
the
trial.
in
other
words,
i
think
what
in
fact
the
government
has
done
here
is
--
i
think
the
position
that
the
issue
could
be
litigated
at
the
trial.
the
defendant
could
have
introduced
the
evidence
in
the
trial
upon
this
issue
would
be
so
desire.
by
that
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
ernest
goodman
this
is
the
first
place
that
argument
as
far
as
i
know
had
been
dissented.
but
i
presume
that
the
reason
that
the
government
now
has
somewhat
changed
his
position
is
because
if
it
does
not
do
so,
it
would
have
to
set
the
position
to
the
trial
court,
which
that
two
essential
elements
of
the
crime
namely
in
possession
and
existence
of
the
record
can
be
waived
if
that
is
the
legal
basis
upon
which
the
trial
court
made
its
decision.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
government
was
prepared
to
argue
that
point
in
a
criminal
case,
it
will
certainly
be
a
noble
position
and
it
does
not
argue
that
position
here.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
think
there
could.
i
think
there
would
be
a
conviction
if
the
government
could
approve
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
if
you're
convicted
without
anything
further?
mr.
ernest
goodman
no
i
will
not
produce
the
record
says.
i
think
that
if
that's
all
that
were
an
evidence.
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
you
were
in
a
position
to
do
similar
that
you
had
any
official
provision
with
the
corporation.
the
record
was
to
be
subpoenaed
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
i
don't
think
the
person
who's
subpoenaed
before
a
committee
needs
to
answer
any
questions
that
might
intend
to
incriminate
him.
mr.
ernest
goodman
pardon?
mr.
ernest
goodman
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no.
i
have
several
answers
to
that
question.
i
--
i
would
like
to
develop
them
now.
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
point.
in
answer
to
your
question
i
will
do
that
right
now.
in
this
case,
the
court
says
exactly
what
he
did.
he
was
subpoenaed
and
the
name,
arthur
mcphaul,
present
the
record
in
the
civil
rights
congress.
he
came
there
and
only
said,
“will
you
produce
the
records?
no,
i
will
not."
now,
there
are
several
suppositions
that
one
may
make
in
the
absence
of
any
testimony.
one
is
that
he
did
have
a
record,
but
he
held
them
not
in
the
representative
capacity
but
in
an
individual
capacity.
now
if
he
did
hold
the
records
belonging
to
an
organization
in
an
individual
capacity
and
not
in
a
representative
capacity
under
the
many
decisions
of
this
court,
he
could
refuse
to
produce
those
records.
and
he
will
not
be
in
contempt
to
the
committee
for
refusing
to
do
so
if
he
asserted
his
constitutional
privilege.
of
course,
he
had
asserted
the
constitutional
privilege
all
through
this.
and
his
final
answer
then,
i
will
not
produce
the
records
if
based
as
i
think
it
could
well
be
said
here
on
this
constitutional
privilege
would
be
one
for
which
he
could
not
be
held
in
contempt.
so
that
--
that's
one
possibility
that
he
was
not
holding
the
records
in
any
official
capacity,
which
eventually
will
not
be
guilty
of
contempt.
now,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
kind
that
mcphaul
get
hold
any
records
in
any
representative
capacity,
none
at
all.
and
in
the
absence
of
such
a
connecting
link
between
the
individual
who
said
i
will
not
produce
the
record
then
has
a
right
to
say
so
if
they're
not
in
a
representative
capacity.
and
--
and
the
failure
to
produce
them
cannot
result
in
the
contempt
conviction.
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
think
that
many
decisions
of
this
court.
curcio
versus
u.s.
is
the
last
one,
has
made
very
clear
that
a
person
who
does
not
have
to
answer
any
questions
concerning
records
that
are
subpoenaed
and
if
--
if
a
witness
were
asked
to
--
if
a
witness
were
asked
before
a
committee,
"are
you
the
president
of
xyz
corporation?"
and
if
he
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
he
does
not
have
to
say
yes
to
that.
he
does
not
have
to
answer
that
question.
now
then
the
ques
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
of
course,
if
you
refuse
to
answer
the
question
without
any
basis
or
claiming
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
then
you
maybe
--
you're
maybe
guilty
of
contempt
under
the
circumstances
shown
in
that
particular
record
for
having
answered
--
refused
to
answer
a
question
which
you
should
have
answered.
but
not
for
failing
to
produce
the
records
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
the
records
were
in
existence.
he
could
be
excited
for
contempt
for
failing
to
answer
that
question,
yes.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
if
mcphaul
recited
the
contempt
of
refusing
to
answer
a
question
here,
he
might
have
an
entirely
different
situation,
but
we
don't
have
that.
the
government
has
only
proceeded
on
one
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
possible
indictment
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
failure
to
produce
the
records,
not
for
failure
to
answer
questions.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes.
in
that
case,
if
you
refuse
to
answer
any
relevant
question,
you
would
be
in
contempt
to
court.
mr.
ernest
goodman
right.
now,
the
government
forced
this
man,
if
he
had
the
records,
if
they
were
available
or
any
evidence
from
which
a
fair
inference
of
existence
and
control
could
be
made
for
jury
determination
then
a
defendant
of
this
case
or
any
person
would
be
guilty
of
contempt.
what
the
government
is
arguing
for
is
a
proposition
that
they
don't
have
to
produce
any
evidence
of
any
kind.
they
can
rely
to
government
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
they
claimed
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
they
claim
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
to
him
originally
and
in
view
of
that,
there
--
the
reasonable
basis
forms
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
ernest
goodman
the
charge
to
the
jury
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
the
charge
to
the
jury
on
this
was
precisely
this.
that's
on
page
67
in
the
transcript.
that
if
you
find
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
defendant
appeared
before
the
said
subcommittee
and
then
refused
or
failed
to
make
any
explanations
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
the
records
designated
in
the
subpoena
or
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
such
records
were
under
his
possession
or
control
are
charged
you
that
you
may
not
consider
the
questions
of
whether
the
records
and
documents
designated
in
the
subpoena
were
actually
in
existence
or
under
the
possession
or
control
of
the
defendant,
because
if
the
defendant
had
legitimate
reasons
for
failing
to
produce
said
record,
he
should
have
stated
his
reasons
for
noncompliance
with
the
subpoena
when
he
appeared
before
the
subcommittee.
so
that
the
committee
as
a
jury
in
effect
was
told
that
they
could
convict
the
defendant
even
though
there
were
no
such
records
and
even
though
if
there
were,
he
had
no
possession
or
control.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
the
court
clearly
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
this
is
the
only
portion.
mr.
ernest
goodman
the
government
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
they
didn't
take
any
exceptions.
i
took
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
here
they
--
here
they
defend
the
legal
position
and
the
legal
correctness
of
the
charge,
but
i
think
they
modified
their
position
as
taken
below
and
in
fact
to
disagree
with
the
trial
court
because
they
say
that
there
was
a
prima
facie
case
created
by
virtue
of
sufficient
evidence
on
this
separate
record
dealing
with
pertinency
by
which
the
subcommittee
had
a
reasonable
basis
for
issuing
the
subpoena
to
fall
on
the
assumption
or
the
inference
that
he
probably
had
the
record
and
once
that
reasonable
basis
for
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
has
been
established
in
this
set
of
record,
they
say
that
the
burden
then
shifted
to
the
defendant.
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
i
don't
see
that
at
all.
i
don't
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
i
think
the
court
there
said
that
the
issue
could
not
be
raised
at
this
trial
at
all.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
i'm
talking
about
the
charge.
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
he
told
the
jury
that
if
he
did
--
if
he
did
not
make
an
explanation
and
(inaudible)
but
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
at
the
committee.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
it's
obviously
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
if
the
court's
language
means
anything
that
the
jury
had
to
determine
whether
he
made
an
explanation
before
the
committee,
obviously,
the
only
testimony
that
will
determine
that
question
would
be
the
transcript
of
testimony
taken
before
the
committee
would
show
simply
this,
that
when
asked,
"will
you
produce
some?"
he
said,
"i
will
not."
there
was
no
other
evidence.
now
presumably,
i
could've
introduced
other
evidence
to
show
that
something
else
had
been
said
before
the
committee
by
way
of
an
explanation,
that
i'm
sure
would've
been
permitted
because
the
transcript
was
incorrect.
but
i
don't
think
if
this
language
means
what
it
says
that
a
jury
had
to
determine
what
was
said
before
the
committee,
that
evidence
could
be
introduced
at
the
trial
other
than
what
was
said
before
the
committee
by
way
of
explanation
and
so
the
court
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
--
i
don't
think
it
is,
because
i
asked
the
court
to
charge
the
jury
in
my
request
to
charge.
mr.
ernest
goodman
on
page
74.
before
you
can
find
the
defendant
willfully
refused
to
produce
the
record,
the
documents
and
records
is
charged
in
the
indictment.
you
must
first
find
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
that
such
records,
documents
or
records
were
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
service
of
the
subpoena
as
one
charge
relate
to
that.
second,
before
you
can
find
the
defendant
willfully
refused
to
produce
the
documents
and
record
as
charged
with
the
indictment,
you
must
first
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
search
documents
or
records,
were
in
the
custody
of
control
of
the
defendant
timely
service
of
the
subpoena.
third,
upon
all
the
evidence,
you
are
unable
to
conclude
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
documents
or
records
called
for
by
the
subpoena
were
in
existence
and
in
the
custody
are
controlled
by
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
service
of
the
subpoena,
then
you
cannot
find
the
defendant
willfully
refused
to
produce
such
documents
or
record
and
you
must
return
the
verdict
of
not
guilty.
now,
all
of
these
charges
were
designed
to
permit
the
jury
to
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
actually
such
records
or
documents
were
in
existence
and
actually
whether
the
defendant
had
possession
or
control
as
a
fact.
the
court
refused
to
permit
the
jury
to
consider
the
question
of
whether
the
documents
were
in
existence
or
whether
he
had
control
and
told
the
jury
all
you
consider
is
whether
he
had
made
an
explanation.
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
i
think
the
court
simply
instructed
the
jury
on
that.
he
has
the
one
--
one
instruction
on
that
that
the
meaning
of
willfulness
means
knowing
consciously.
mr.
ernest
goodman
explicit
--
explicitly
no.
implicitly,
i
would
say,
yes.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
here
among
other
things
that
--
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
fleischman
case,
for
the
government
to
have
offered
evidence
of
actual
possession
and
actual
existence
of
the
documents
would
have
referred
the
government
to
prove
it
negative.
this
is
the
argument
that
makes
connection
with
the
--
the
reason
why
it
should
not
be
required
to
introduce
evidence
of
possession
and
existence.
this
is
what
the
government
says.
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes,
the
government
makes
this
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
this
is
what
the
argument
is
that
the
government
made.
of
course,
i
--
i
--
in
my
reply
brief,
state
that
to
prove
the
existence
of
record
and
to
prove
possession
or
control
if
not
requiring
the
government
to
prove
it
negative,
but
it's
requiring
the
government
to
prove
it
positive.
these
are
the
two
essential
elements
of
the
crime
which
the
government
must
prove
to
get
a
conviction.
to
say
that
these
elements
of
the
crime
are
negative
as
the
government
argues
the
brief,
would
mean
that
in
every
criminal
offense,
the
government
could
be
--
could
be
excused
from
proving
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
that
would
make
up
the
crime
by
this
argument
that
it's
difficult
to
make
such
proof
that's
really
what
(inaudible)
but,
i
don't
think
that
it
comes
within
the
fleischman
rule
of
the
proof
of
a
negative
by
the
government.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
pertinency
and
search
and
seizure,
i
--
i
want
to
just
allude
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
separate
record
made.
i
have
requested
the
government
on
the
issue
of
pertinency.
the
government
asserting
and
we
agree
that
this
was
an
issue
of
the
law
for
the
court
to
determine.
and
on
that
separate
record
dealing
with
pertinency,
there
were
some
evidence
--
the
following
evidence
was
introduced
in
addition
to
what
i
have
already
given.
first,
the
purpose
of
the
committee
hearing
that
is
to
determine
whether
there
was
communist
activity
in
the
detroit
area
as
a
major
extent.
the
testimony
of
the
witness
of
the
civil
rights
congress
have
been
declared
as
subversive
organization
by
the
attorney
general
without
any
support
of
proof
over
there,
that
the
purpose
of
the
committee
was
to
determine
the
scope
of
communist
activity
in
the
area
and
that
was
the
reason
for
subpoenaing
the
records
of
the
civil
rights
congress
in
accordance
with
the
statement
of
the
witness
who
was
a
member
of
that
subcommittee
at
that
time.
mr.
ernest
goodman
the
same
witness.
also
testimony
that
--
of
senator
potter
that
they
had
of
--
of
1950
--
1947
that
the
committee
have
certain
letterheads
which
indicated
that
mr.
mcphaul
was
the
executive
secretary
of
the
civil
right
congress.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
that
was
offered
as
evidence
to
show
pertinency.
it
was
offered
as
evidence
on
the
--
on
the
record
before
the
jury,
but
the
court
excluded
the
letterhead,
which
was
offered,
because
there
were
no
proofs
of
it.
but
on
the
separate
record,
the
court
held
that
hearsay
evidence
of
this
kind
was
admissible
for
the
purpose
of
showing
the
pertinency
with
respect
to
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena
to
mcphaul.
mr.
ernest
goodman
well,
i
think
that's
the
argument
of
the
government
here,
at
least
in
part
upon
this
evidence
taken
on
this
record
with
respect
to
pertinency.
mr.
ernest
goodman
just
this
one
statement
that
potter
said,
the
committee
had
information
according
to
a
certain
letterhead
in
1947,
that
mr.
mcphaul
was
the
executive
secretary
of
the
civil
right
congress.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that
was
on
pertinency.
mr.
ernest
goodman
the
governments
position
on
that
as
i
understand
it
is
that
they
told
--
they
can
use
it
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
the
reasonable
grounds
for
the
issuance
of
the
subpoena.
mr.
ernest
goodman
they
say,
that
is
the
basis
the
congress
have
put
in.
mr.
ernest
goodman
at
the
recess,
i
was
indicating
the
nature
of
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
government
on
the
separate
record
dealing
with
pertinency.
and
the
question
was
raised
as
to
whether
any
of
this
evidence
was
used
by
the
government
in
asserting
in
its
provision
here
that
it
has
established
its
claim
of
possession
and
existence.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
argument
of
the
government
on
page
16
of
its
brief
under
which
it
argued
that
it
had
established
a
prima
facie
case
where
it
says
that
when
the
committee
subpoenaed
petitioner
to
produce
certain
designated
records
of
the
civil
rights
congress,
it
"had
the
information
that
mr.
mcphaul
was
the
executive
director
or
executive
secretary
of
the
civil
rights
congress."
and
it
cites
from
the
record,
pages17
and
21,
now
those
two
pages
of
the
record
which
it
cites
support
of
this
legal
proposition
are
parts
of
the
separate
record
dealing
only
with
pertinency.
i
--
i
point
that
out
to
indicate
that
apparently
the
government
does
rely
on
the
separate
record
for
proof
of
a
--
in
support
of
its
argument
that
it
had
established
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
ernest
goodman
no.
it
was
not
part
of
the
record.
now,
at
that
trial
(inaudible).
i
don't
believe
so.
no,
i'm
quite
--
i'm
quite
sure
it
was
not.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right,
at
the
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
it
does
not.
there's
no
indication
on
the
subpoena
that
mcphaul
has
any
relationship
with
the
organization
through
records
he
is
directed
to
produce.
and
i
--
in
my
brief,
i
point
to
many
other
cases
that
have
come
up
in
this
court
before
where
the
subpoenas
have
been
directed
either
to
the
individual
in
his
descriptive
capacity
as
an
officer
or
to
the
organizations
served
upon
him
in
his
official
capacity.
this
is
apparently
the
usual
way
in
which
such
subpoenas
are
issued
if
they're
--
it's
intended
to
bring
in
that
person
as
--
in
a
representative
capacity
for
the
organization.
this
case,
that
was
not
done
and
the
government
in
absence
of
this
kind
of
procedure
relies
again
upon
this
statement
apparently
on
the
separate
record
of
pertinency
that
where
senator
potter
testifies
that
they
had
evidence
that
he
had
and
that
is
mcphaul
as
the
executive
secretary
of
the
civil
rights
congress.
now,
he
was
asked
by
the
way
by
his
own
--
by
the
district
attorney
to
whether
there
is
anything
that
he
could
show
or
any
basis
upon
which
he
could
support
his
statement
that
arthur
mcphaul
had
any
relationship
or
was
a
member
of
the
civil
rights
congress.
and
that
question
directed
by
the
government
to
senator
potter
appears
on
page
18
of
the
record.
i
will
ask
you
whether
or
not
either
the
so-called
the
executive
or
closed
sessions
or
the
public
hearings,
mr.
mcphaul
was
ever
identified
as
a
member
of
the
civil
rights
congress.
that
question
was
never
answered
and
no
proof
was
presented
to
show
that
mcphaul,
who
--
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
ever
identified
in
any
capacity
a
member
or
otherwise
of
the
civil
rights
congress
other
than
this
conclusory
statement
by
potter
--
on
a
separate
record
that
they
had
evidence
that
he
was
an
executive
secretary
so
that
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
that
he
at
one
time,
yes.
the
record
is
not
clear
even
on
the
separate
record
because
there
senator
potter
says
that
in
1947,
or
thereabout,
they
had
several
letterheads
to
indicate
that
mcphaul
was
executive
secretary.
that
of
course,
even
if
they
had
such
evidence
would
have
been
five
years
before
he
was
subpoenaed.
so,
in
so
far
as
the
government
can
rely
upon
this
separate
record
dealing
with
pertinency,
which
they
--
it
was
--
it
was
had
outside
the
presence
of
a
jury
and
i
don't
see
how
they
can
rely
upon
that
to
establish
their
claim
that
they
proved
the
elements
of
the
crime
before
the
jury,
but
even
if
they
were
permitted
to
do
it
on
the
reasoning
which
they
present
here,
it
seemed
to
me
that
that
is
hardly
a
proof
of
the
kind
that
would
be
required
in
any
circumstances
to
show
that
the
defendant
here
was
in
a
representative
capacity
of
the
organization
or
that
there
were
such
records.
on
the
two
other
questions
search
and
seizure
and
pertinency,
i'm
only
going
to
make
one
comment.
i
think
i'll
read
that
as
it
covers
the
subject
and
that
is
that
on
reflection,
it
seems
to
me
that
really
both
of
these
matters
can
be
covered
under
the
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure
rather
than
separate.
both
the
government
and
ourselves
deal
with
them
separately
but
further
study
of
the
case
has
seemed
to
indicate
that
under
the
fourth
amendment,
all
issues
relating
to
pertinency
can
be
as
readily
raised
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
subpoenaing
as
by
trying
to
bring
it
under
one
of
the
other
amendments
so
that
pertinency
and
the
scope
read
from
the
subpoenaing
i
think
can
more
properly
and
clearly
be
considered
as
a
argument
dealing
with
the
same
problem.
i'd
like
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
yes
sir.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
one
of
our
observations,
yes.
thank
you
(inaudible)
i'd
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
-
the
time
i
have
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
i
have
any
further
argument
but
if
there're
any
questions
that
the
court
feels
--
would
like
to
ask
or
any
explanation,
i
would
(inaudible).
mr.
ernest
goodman
that
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case,
it
only
arises
by
reason
of
the
argument
of
the
issue.
mr.
ernest
goodman
by
reason
of
the
argument
that
is
made
by
the
government.
the
government's
argument
raises
the
issue
as
to
whether
in
fact
he
did
use
the
fifth
amendment
properly
or
whether
he
did
not,
the
implication
of
the
word,
"i
will
not"
raises
the
right
of
the
witness
before
the
committee
to
use
the
fifth
amendment.
because
of
that
argument,
the
issue
was
raised
in
a
case
in
that
way.
mr.
ernest
goodman
that's
right.
and
i
--
perhaps
i
ought
to
just
say
this,
counsel
has
repeatedly
said
that
somehow
(inaudible)
this
man's
attorney
should
have
specifically
as
a
special
defense
or
an
affirmative
way
raised
the
question
of
--
of
possession
and
existence.
as
a
lawyer
who
has
handled
many
criminal
cases,
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
told
that
other
than
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
an
attorney
has
to
affirmatively
raise
the
question
of
the
failure
of
the
prosecution
to
establish
essential
elements
of
a
crime.
if,
i
as
an
attorney
have
that
duty,
i
certainly
then
unaware
of
it
and
i
--
i
would
--
mr.
ernest
goodman
with
respect
to
the
issues
of
(inaudible)
subpoenaing
and
pertinency,
i
agree
we
have
somewhat
a
different
question
and
it's
a
more
difficult.
we
tried
to
answer
it
but
we
--
but
with
respect
to
the
other
matters
to
whether
he
has
to
say,
"i
--
i
don't
have
the
document",
words
to
that
affect,
i
don't
think
that
he
is
required
to
do
that
at
all.
he
of
course,
if
he
has
the
documents
in
a
representative
capacity
and
does
not
produce
them,
he
will
be
found
guilty
of
contempt
once
the
government
establishes
that.
that
is
the
chance
a
man
takes.
but
in
the
absence
of
such
proof,
a
man
doesn't
have
to
say
(inaudible).
