justice
potter
stewart
could
you
tell
us
that
he
did
have
the
counsel
with
him.
justice
potter
stewart
these
words
of
the
court
were
--
came
after
--
draw
a
motion
and
after,
it
was
clear
that
you're
not
going
to
put
on
a
defense
at
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
it
wasn't
allowed
with
this
petitioner
--
i
thought
it
isn't
allowed
to
make
any
explanation
on
the
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
really
know
that
he
did
the
crime.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
the
same
witness
under
senator
potter.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
get
to
that
mr.
friedman,
am
i
right
in
understanding
this
that
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
a
theory
that
since
this
petitioner
had
not
offered
any
explanation,
it
is
not
anyway
indicative
that
he
has
them,
that
the
records
were
not
in
existence,
so
that
they
--
so
they
were
not
in
his
control.
at
the
--
at
the
committee
hearing,
since
that
it
happen,
therefore,
this
was
no
longer
available
even
as
a
defense,
even
if
he
wanted
to
bring
them
at
the
trial.
wasn't
that
the
theory
of
the
trial
court
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
theory
now
is
as
--
as
to
the
--
what
the
law
ought
to
be,
this
is
that
the
--
had
he
wanted
to
do
so,
at
--
at
the
defense
of
this
criminal
indictment,
he
would've
been
free
to
do
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
rather
than
a
valid
defense.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
self-incrimination
in
that
issues
mr.
goodman?
justice
potter
stewart
only
what?
