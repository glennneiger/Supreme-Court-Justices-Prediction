do
you
think
the
second
circuit
actually
that
the
money
had
to
be
given
to
the
children
or
--
or
simply
spend
it
exclusively
on
their
behalf
for
their
benefit.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
tadlock,
i
understand
your
argument
that
it
would
be
must
at
most
unfortunate
to
have
a
rule
that
--
if
two
divorced
spouses
live
in
different
circuits
to
have
a
rule
that
would
be
in
internally
inconsistent.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
rule
for
which
you
contend
has
just
those
dangerous
in
it.
as
i
understand
it,
you
say
that
the
commissioner
and
subsequently
the
court
should
look
at
the
agreement
as
a
whole
and
draw
their
own
conclusions
as
to
really
what's
intended.
now,
certainly,
i
suppose
there
are
agreements
as
maybe
one
of
them
are
reasonable
minds
could
differ
as
to
what
was
intended
applying
that
rule.
whereas,
if
you
apply
a
very
strict
rule
such
as
that
which
is
evolved
in
the
second
circuit,
there's
--
there
is
it
seems
to
be,
much
less
likelihood
if
that
rule
is
universally
applicable
--
applicable,
much
less
likelihood
of
the
conflicts
that
you
told
us
about.

justice
potter
stewart
this
area
certainly
is
about
the
most
important
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
on
lawyers
interrupting
their
agreements
will
know
where
they
stand.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
is
it
your
position
that
wherever
there's
a
reduction
clause,
it's
quite
a
part
from
my
variations
that
there
maybe
a
non-reduction
clause,
is
that
wherever
there's
a
reduction
clause,
that
part
of
it
would
be
attributable
for
the
--
for
the
children?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
commissioner's
position
now?
justice
potter
stewart
how
old
were
the
children
at
that
time
of
the
separation?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
his
children
or?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
geared
to
his
gross
income,
is
that
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
there's
a
gross
saving
in
taxes
under
your
theory
but
it
is
--
is
mr.
justice
whittaker
correct
in
saying
that
there's
a
saving
this,
a
tax
savings
to
her.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
a
more
settled
argument.
but
assuming
that
he
continues
to
have
sufficient
income
to
meet
his
obligations
under
this
agreement,
it's
correct,
isn't
it
that
she
comes
out
ahead
tax
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
the
point
is
that
this
evidences
contemplation
of
the
parties
that
as
the
children
grew
up
or
perhaps
unfortunately
died,
the
wife
would
perhaps
need
to
live
in
a
smaller
house
or
in
an
apartment
and
that
her
needs
would
be
less.
but
if
they
term
fixed
in
the
statute
requires
much
more
definitive
and
it's
evidence
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
--
that
the
word
"fixed"
has
a
meaning
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
all
deductible
to
--
for
the
husband
and
all
the
income
to
the
wife.
that's
clear,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i
didn't
hear
earlier
what
you
did
with
the
--
let's
say
fact
on
this
--
on
this
agreement
that
upon
the
wife
remarries
even
--
even
within
a
short
time
after
this
agreement,
all
the
payment
cease.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
they
--
they
cease
because
of
the
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
terminate
the
agreement.
that's
a
term
of
the
agreement
they
cease
under
the
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
by
reason
of
the
agreement.
