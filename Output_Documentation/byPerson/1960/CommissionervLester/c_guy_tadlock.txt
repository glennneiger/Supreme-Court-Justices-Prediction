mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
which
spouse
is
liable
for
tax
on
child
support
payments,
payments
which
are
paid
by
the
husband
to
the
wife
under
a
separation
agreement
or
a
divorce
decree.
a
conflict
has
developed
among
the
circuits
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
statute
after
the
statute
had
been
applied
in
accordance
with
the
commissioner's
position
over
a
period
of
about
15
years.
the
primary
question,
therefore,
we
believe
as
one
of
the
statutory
construction,
specifically
the
meanings
--
the
meaning
of
two
words
in
this
statute,
the
words,
"payable
for."
the
controversial
language
is
found
in
section
22
(k)
which
has
set
forth
in
petitioner's
brief
on
page
35.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
of
the
1939
code.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
the
54
code
your
honor
is
substantially
the
--
the
same.
the
only
change
makes
it
conform
to
a
change
--
that
congress
had
in
mind
that
the
agreement
did
not
have
to
particularly
attach
itself
with
divorce
decree.
it
could
be
a
separate
maintenance
without
divorce
decree.
otherwise,
it's
substantially
the
same.
now,
there
is
also
a
treasure
regulation
of
implementing
this
section.
it's
found
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
it
starts
at
page
36.
but
it
does
not
cover
this
point
directly,
the
--
the
pointing
issue.
in
combination
with
section
23
(u)
which
was
found
on
36,
22
(k)
provides
as
a
general
rule
that
the
support
payments
will
be
taxable
to
the
wife,
deductible
by
the
husband.
however,
the
section
draws
a
distinction
between
alimony
and
child
support
payments
and
we're
concerned
here
today
with
the
provisions
for
child
support
payments.
the
statute
assumes
from
its
wording
that
--
and
that
this
is
genially
the
case
that
the
periodic
payments
from
the
husband
and
the
wife
will
include
both
alimony
and
child
support.
but
it
released
the
tax
on
and
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
second
sentence
of
22
(k)
on
page
35.
it
released
that
the
wife,
the
tax
on
that
part
of
the
periodic
payment
which
is
fixed
by
the
terms
of
the
instrument
as
being
payable
for
child
support.
now,
therefore,
the
terms
of
the
instrument
either
divorce
decree
or
the
agreement
must
fix
an
amount
payable
for
child
support.
now,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
since
1942
has
been
fought
--
has
been
following
a
practice,
a
consistent
practice
of
interpreting
the
statute
to
mean
that
the
words
"payable
for"
simply
mean
that
an
amount
must
be
set
aside
by
the
terms
of
the
instrument
as
payable
for
child
support
allocated
or
apportioned
for
child
support
looking
to
the
purpose
of
the
payment
irrespective
of
how
the
wife
uses
the
money
and
how
the
wife
uses
the
money
is
the
heart
of
this
case,
we
believe.
now,
in
contrast,
the
second
circuit,
fall
out
reasonably
by
the
sixth
circuit
takes
a
much
more
strict
review
of
the
wording
of
the
statute.
in
his
opinion
below,
the
second
circuit
says
that
the
words
payable
for
have
reference
to
terms
and
in
agreement
which
must
fix
an
amount
that
must
be
used
by
the
wife
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
children
without
regard
or
whether
she
feels
that
the
money
should
be
used
for
herself,
maybe
for
the
best
interest
of
--
of
all
her
children
without
exercising
any
discretion
at
all.
the
second
circuit
says
she
--
she
may
not
have
discretion
as
to
the
use
since
she
can
have
no
possibility
of
a
beneficial
interest
in
herself.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
we
think
that
the
--
that
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
means
both.
but
first,
it
means
that
she
may
not
spend
any
of
it
on
herself
and
the
opinion
uses
this
language,
even
if
the
expenditure
on
herself
may
in
the
long
run
be
the
best
for
the
group,
for
instance
to
buy
a
house
or
a
rug
for
a
home
or
an
automobile.
now,
the
court
says
that
she
may
have
no
discretion
at
all
as
to
the
use
of
this
money.
it
goes
on
to
say
--
even
to
this
extent
that
the
wife
may
feel
that
it
might
be
necessary
for
one
period
of
time
to
keep
the
children
at
home,
not
giving
them
free
spending
money,
but
she
may
not
do
this.
she
must
give
the
children
the
amount
of
money
set
aside
in
the
instruments
so
they
may
use
it.
if
she
hasn't
discretion,
then,
this
does
not
fit
the
language
according
to
the
opinion
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
well,
of
course.
we
don't
feel
that
it
means
that
it
has
to
hand
it
to
the
children.
but,
it
--
it
uses
this
--
this
language
that
the
wife
under
this
reduction
clause
in
this
agreement,
might
at
one
time
feel
that
best
to
keep
the
children
home
and
not
give
them
free
spending
money.
it
even
goes
on
to
indicate
in
its
opinion
that
the
wife
should
have
no
control
over
the
money
and
that
even
possession
is
suspect
as
to
whether
she
has
it.
language
that
we
think
is
much
more
stricter
than
that
--
much
more
strict
than
that
call
for
about
a
statute.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
we
think
that
would
depend
upon
state
law
of
course.
you
would
have
to
look
to
the
law
of
the
individual
state
to
decide
whether
she's
a
fiduciary
to
not,
whether
she's
a
trustee.
a
congress
in
--
in
the
words
of
the
statute
would
not
require
that
she'll
be
a
trustee.
congress
does
not
require
that
--
that
a
certain
amount
be
used
or
spent
on
the
children.
it
says,
that
if
an
amount
can
be
determined
from
this
instrument
as
payable
for
child
support,
then,
for
tax
purposes,
we
will
say
that
is
not
income
to
the
wife.
it
is
deductible
to
children.
now,
there
are
some
states,
your
honor
that
require
that
a
wife
must
act
as
a
trustee.
there
are
other
states
to
say
the
wife
may
use
this
money
as
she
thinks
best
to
support
the
children
in
the
manner
which
they
are
accustomed
and
the
court
will
not
make
her
spend
it
the
way
that
husband
wants
her
to
spend
it
for
instance
or
somebody
else
may
want
to
spend
it
as
long
as
she's
supporting
the
children.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
right,
your
honor.
this
is
true.
and
we
say
that
regardless
to
our
position
on
how
she
spends
the
money,
even
on
herself,
would
be
permissible
under
the
statute
because
if
she
should
use
the
money
improperly,
this
would
be
a
matter
for
the
husband,
for
the
divorce
court,
for
the
state
or
the
public
which
are
always
parties
do,
a
domestic
relations
proceeding
to
come
in
and
hold
her
accountable
but
for
tax
purposes.
when
congress
says,
"that
if
we
can
find
from
the
terms
of
this
instrument
that
amount
is
payable
for
child
support."
and
then
most
significantly,
they
go
to
the
next
sentence
and
we
refer
you
again
to
page
35
of
the
brief,
the
third
sentence
of
this
section
which
covers
partial
payments.
if
a
husband
is
--
is
making
payments
for
the
support
of
his
wife
and
his
children
and
he
makes
a
--
he
defaults
on
part
of
the
payment
and
he
only
pays
part
of
it,
congress
says,
"that
for
the
purpose
of
this
exception
and
for
the
purposes
of
taxes,
we
will
consider
whatever
he
pays
going
first
to
the
support
of
the
children."
and
then
the
balances
go
to
the
wife.
and
congress
there
was
not
trying
to
directly
use.
the
--
the
wife
may
receive
this
money
and
under
the
very
nature
of
things,
have
to
spend
a
little
bit
on
herself.
congress
was
not
trying
to
police
the
agreements
as
it
went
along.
he
was
trying
to
fix
the
tax
at
a
certain
point.
now,
the
difference
in
the
statutory
interpretation
between
the
commissioner's
position
and
the
commission
of
the
second
circuit
revolves
around
the
reduction
clause.
a
reduction
clause
that
is
--
has
been
in
all
of
the
reported
cases.
now,
the
taxpayer
here
agrees
to
pay
his
wife
a
certain
percentage
of
his
income
for
her
support
and
the
support
of
three
children.
he
doesn't
say
that
x
dollars
is
set
aside
to
support
the
children.
he
does
say
this.
he
says
that,
"the
payments
to
the
wife
will
be
reduced
one-sixth
upon
the
death,
the
marriage
or
the
emancipation
of
any
of
the
three
children."
now,
anyone
of
these
events
if
it
should
occur
would
terminate
his
obligations
to
support
the
children.
if
the
children
--
child
dies,
if
child
becomes
emancipated
or
marries,
then
his
obligation
under
the
law
of
california
ceases.
now,
prior
to
that
time,
prior
to
the
ceasing
of
his
obligations
and
support,
we
think
that
it's
fairly
obvious
that
316
are
one-half.
he
has
set
aside
and
here,
marked
as
payable
for
the
child
support.
now,
there
are
numerous
cases,
25
and
the
tax
court,
sixth
circuit
court
to
courts
of
appeal
decisions
which
hold
that
--
that
a
reduction
clause
which
is
based
upon
an
event
that
will
--
that
will
terminate
the
obligations
to
support
the
children
satisfies
the
agreement
--
satisfied
the
statute
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
you
can
calculate
with
precision
the
exact
amount
that
it
has
been
paid
for
child
support.
the
reduction
clause
in
the
instant
case
we
feel
is
the
most
important
and
the
heart
of
the
case,
but
taxpayer
on
brief
at
least
makes
a
factual
argument
and
we
would
state
very
briefly,
if
the
court's
permission,
a
few
of
the
other
facts,
particularly
those
relied
on
by
the
taxpayer.
because
the
payments
are
based
upon
a
percentage
of
his
income,
there
was
a
maximum
fixed
for
each
year.
all
payments
were
to
--
to
cease
if
the
wife
remarried,
and
the
parties
agreed
to
pay
the
taxes
assessable
against
each
of
them.
in
1942,
and
we
think
this
--
this
history
is
most
important,
in
1942
following
the
so-called
alimony
trust
cases,
the
decision
is
handed
down
by
this
court,
congress
passed
this
section
of
the
code.
it
wanted
to
change
the
law,
but
it
made
a
distinction
between
alimony
and
child
support
payments.
now,
prior
to
1942,
the
decision
of
this
court
had
held
that
payments
made
by
a
husband
to
his
wife
for
her
alimony
or
the
setting
up
of
a
trust
with
the
income
to
go
to
the
wife
would
be
considered
as
a
general
rule
as
income
to
him
not
deductible
and
not
income
to
her.
and
now
of
course,
the
exception
was
that
if
there
was
an
alterable
agreement
and
a
decree
and
a
particular
state
according
to
state
law
that
fix
that
obligation,
it
couldn't
be
changed
and
it
satisfies
obligation,
then,
the
general
rule
had
been
accepted
and
the
husband
then
could
deduct
the
amount.
so,
congress
changed
the
law.
they
had
to
switch
the
basic
law
as
decided
by
this
court.
it
made
a
distinction
between
alimony.
and
in
doing
so,
it
provided
this
that
--
that
if
the
--
the
husband
could
not
deduct
the
portion
of
the
expense,
if
the
agreement
that
he
had
entered
into
or
if
the
divorce
decree
had
terms
in
it
but
set
aside
and
it
uses
a
portion
of
this
amount
as
fixed
and
as
payable
for
the
support
of
children,
then
congress
out
of
the
sentence
that
we
had
in
mind,
which
we
think
is
most
significant.
the
sentence
it
says,
"if
there
was
a
partial
payment,
we
will
consider
it
for
tax
purposes
as
going
towards
the
support
of
the
children."
the
committee
reports
show
a
concern
of
congress
for
inconsistencies
created
by
the
alimony
trust
cases
and
for
the
hardship
on
the
husband.
the
--
the
committee
reports
do
not
indicate
any
particular
concern
with
support
payments.
it
started
out
by
having
in
the
words
of
the
statute
specifically
designated
that
changed
that
to
fix
and
it
used
terms
support
payments
going
to
the
children
or
attributable
to
the
support
of
the
children.
and
we
feel
that
none
of
these
terms,
none
of
these
reports
or
remarks
indicate
that
congress
was
trying
to
say
that
it
had
to
be
used
for
this
purpose.
there
was
no
disapproval
of
the
commissioner's
position
in
1954
when
the
--
these
sections
were
reenacted
in
the
code
and
substantially
the
same
form
into
the
same
effect.
at
that
time,
there
were
more
than
a
dozen
cases
in
which
this
very
issue
had
been
decided,
in
which
reduction
clauses
had
been
interpreted
by
the
tax
court,
in
which
the
use,
argument
had
been
raised
by
taxpayers
and
rejected
by
the
tax
court
and
by
three
of
the
circuits.
it
maybe
that
congress,
if
there's
any
--
any
significance
may
have
been
aware
of
this
consistent
administrative
practice.
the
congress
of
ninth
--
or
the
commissioner
on
1946
in
the
budd
case,
the
first
case
that
--
that
came
on
this
regard
interpret
the
statute
as
requiring
this
on
the
part
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
that
you
examine
the
instrument
as
a
whole
to
try
to
ascertain
if
there
were
provisions
therein
which
fix
an
amount
to
be
payable
one
part
for
alimony,
another
part
for
child
support
without
regard
to
use.
and
this
was
upheld
by
the
courts
until
just
recently
three
decisions,
the
second
circuit
and
followed
recently
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
which
the
--
they
held
that
the
reduction
clause
was
insufficiently
marking
that
there
had
to
be
terms
in
the
instrument
which
fixing
amount
and
they
use
the
words,
"to
be
use
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
support
of
children
without
the
wife
having
any
possibility
of
a
beneficial
interest
or
using
her
discretion
in
any
manner
in
which
the
money
--
in
any
manner
the
money
was
spent."
it
goes
on
to
say
that
it's
not
what
she
receives.
this
is
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
ash
case
following
while
not,
what
she
receives
but
what
she
uses.
then,
we
have
two
more
cases
cited
in
our
brief,
the
metcalf
case
in
the
first,
the
eisinger
case
in
the
ninth
where
they
continue
the
general
rule
of
the
commissioner,
and
that
the
courts
in
saying
that
they
feel
that
it
is
not
the
use
--
it's
not
the
control,
but
for
tax
purposes
what
they
have
in
mind
is,
"can
you
find
out
definitely
terms
in
the
agreement
which
set
aside
an
amount
for
payable
to
child
support.
and
they
affirmed
again
their
belief
that
a
reduction
clause,
the
reduction
clause
which
reduces
the
amount
when
the
obligation
support
ends
meets
this
situation.
now
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
she
did
not
treat
his
income
--
well,
i
--
sorry,
the
record
does
not
show
this.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
it
does
not
show
this,
your
honor.
now,
we
--
we
might
say
that
it's
the
wife
is
a
resident
of
california.
this
is
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit
holds
this
is
not
income
to
the
wife
under
this
situation.
the
husband
is
now
resident
of
new
york.
the
second
circuit
holds
that
it
is
income
for
wife
and
not
deductible
by
him.
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
petition
and
we
assume
probably
one
of
the
reasons
for
granting
a
petition.
it's
this
possible
in
the
inconsistency
of
the
--
of
the
treatments
throughout
the
circuits.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
we
think
the
intention
is
important
if
you
confine
it
within
the
four
corners
of
the
agreement,
but
only
within
the
agreement.
the
congress
said
--
excuse
me.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
we
think
that
there
is
no
significance
to
that
at
all
your
honor
for
this
reason.
it
says,
"the
taxes
assessable
against
her
based
upon
the
amount
paid,
the
taxes
assessable
against
her."
the
parties
did
not
try
to
fix
the
instant
of
the
tax
in
this
agreement.
they
could
not
do
so.
congress
did
so
by
the
words
of
the
statute.
but
if
you
find
terms
in
an
instrument
that
indicates
that
an
amount
is
paid
for
child
support,
that
fixes
the
instant
of
the
tax.
but
the
language
here
after
payment
of
all
income
taxes
assessable
upon
the
wife
with
respect
to
the
amounts
thus
paid,
now,
it
could
easily
mean
that
she
would
be
taxable
on
the
alimony
and
not
taxable
upon
the
child
support
payments.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that
the
amount
to
be
paid
would
be
20%
of
his
income.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
after
the
wife
has
paid
the
taxes,
assessable
to
her.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
yes,
on
the
alimony.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
which
will
be
50
--
50%.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
well,
but
50%
of
the
payment
is
for
alimony.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
50%
is
for
child
support,
316.
so
it
will
be
easier
to
calculate
the
amount
of
her
tax
and
then
to
deduct
that.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
it
is
her
money
and
the
children's
money
to
be
used
as
she
determines
to
support
the
children
in
a
manner
in
which
they
are
accustomed.
now,
she
doesn't
get
15,600.
she
gets
20%
of
his
gross
income
provided,
it
will
no
exceed
to
15,600
after
she
pays
the
tax
on
the
amount
assessable
to
her.
and
of
course,
our
point
is
that
the
amount
assessable
to
her
is
the
alimony.
they
are
not
paid
for
her
support
and
--
and
not
the
50%.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
we
have
two
comments
on
that
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
--
mr.
justice
stewart
on
that.
one
is,
that
there
are
some
things
more
important
than
certainty
we
believe.
here,
the
interpretation
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
well,
sir
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
and
there
would
be
a
little
opportunity
or
--
or
very
few
instance
in
which
they
would
be
an
amount
for
child
support.
the
tax
would
always
be
on
the
wife
and
the
children
on
the
amount
of
money.
here,
the
parties
may
carry
out
the
congressional
intent
of
dividing
--
and
these
things
between
alimony
and
child
support.
we
think
that
--
that
the
second
circuit's
view
would
be
a
more
inconsistent
and
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
state
law
every
time
to
find
out
the
wife's
obligation
whether
she
had
to
spend
the
money
for
the
children
or
not
and
just
--
what
are
relationship
would
be.
of
course,
this
may
--
i
--
i
have
no
doubt
this
would
probably
foreclosed
the
situation.
but,
we
don't
think
that
congress
intended
that.
and
then,
a
second
part
of
the
answer
if
i
may,
"if
we
now
come
to
the
point
as
the
commissioner
has
and
as
the
court
have,
except
the
second
and
sixth
circuit,
that
if
you
can
tell
with
precision
how
much
is
paid
for
child
support,
if
you
use
a
reduction
clause
in
which
the
event
terminates
the
obligation
of
the
husband
and
wife
support
the
children,
then
you
will
have
no
difficulty."
everybody
can
understand
it.
i
say
that
because
in
the
weil
case,
the
payment
ceased
if
the
children
died
or
at
least
the
majority,
only
if
the
wife
remarried
which
she
may
never
do,
which
means
that
she
could
have
received
money
long
after
her
obligations
support
had
ceased.
in
the
--
in
the
hershon
case,
the
payments
only
terminated
if
the
wife
remarried.
but
those
--
but
the
commissioner
has
agreed
not
to
press
those
charges
if
it's
understood
that
it's
now
the
rule
is
this,
if
the
event
ceases
--
terminates
the
support
of
the
children,
then
you
can
tell
exactly
how
much
is
meant.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
only
if
the
reduction
clause
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
the
--
the
commissioner's
position
would
be
that
if
you
examine
the
instrument
to
hold
and
find
terms
that
will
fix
an
amount
and
if
a
reduction
clause
will
do
this.
now,
the
commissioner
has
held
that
reduction
clauses
do
not
do
this
when
the
wife
wants
to
show
use.
the
courts
have
held
that
all
reduction
clauses
do
not
fit
the
situation,
and
we
agree
with
that,
for
instance,
the
one
that
the
reduction
would
be
only
if
the
wife
remarries,
this
continuously
may
never
come
in
to
being.
the
commissioner
does
not
--
does
not
pursue
this.
but
if
you
can
tell
that
the
obligation
for
this
would
be
out
that
the
reduction
will
occur
when
the
obligation
support
the
child
ceases,
then
you
can
tell
exactly
how
much.
we
feel
that
there
--
your
honors
that
there's
nothing
in
the
development
of
the
law
and
the
legislative
history
in
the
wording
of
the
statute
that
requires
this
strict
and
rigid
interpretation
of
the
second
circuit.
then,
the
interpretation
which
says,
"the
amount
must
be
used
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
support
of
the
children.
the
wife
may
have
no
discretion
in
its
use.
she
may
not
spend
what
she
thinks
is
best
in
the
long
run,
for
the
group
as
a
whole."
these
are
the
words
that
they
used.
she
may
not
spend
this.
and
we
feel
that
that
requirement
is
not
called
for
by
the
statutes.
it's
not
called
for
by
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
law
in
this
field
and
that
if
you
can
find
from
looking
at
the
whole
instrument,
terms
that
fixed
in
amount
payable
to
child
support,
you
fix
the
incident
of
the
tax
thereby
and
you
satisfy
the
statute.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
mr.
chief
justice,
please
the
court.
if
the
payments
per
child
support
in
--
in
agreement
or
divorce
decree
are
to
this
effect,
so
much
money
payable
for
support
of
the
wife
and
the
children
then
it
does
not
meet
the
test
of
the
statute,
this
is
in
the
regulation,
this
is
clear.
but
if
parties
go
all
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
right.
so
that
in
this
agreement
for
instance
and
in
the
agreement,
if
you
have
just
the
first
part
that
we
read,
i
hereby
agree
to
pay
my
wife
20%
of
my
gross
income
for
her
support
and
support
for
the
children,
then
that
ends
it
because
the
--
the
congress
want
to
make
a
distinction
but
they
went
on
then
with
the
sentence.
but
if
the
terms
of
the
agreement
fix
an
amount
as
payable
for
and
what
happened
here,
then,
the
husband
went
on
or
somebody
went
on
and
they
agreed
to
sign
it
to
reduction
clause.
they
didn't
have
to
do
this
but
they
did,
a
reduction
clause.
if
one
of
the
children
die,
remarries
or
becomes
emancipated
and
the
things
will
be
reduced
by
one-sixth,
there
were
three
children,
this
earmarked
set
aside
a
portion
an
amount
of
the
payment
as
for
the
support
of
the
children.
now,
the
question
we
submit
is
statutory
construction
of
the
words
payable
for.
does
it
require
that
there
must
be
terms
in
there
that
fixed
an
obligation
on
the
wife
to
use
it
for
or
is
it
enough
to
--
to
interpret
this
words,
give
them
their
normal,
their
common
meaning
as
we
think
that
congress
intended
and
that
is
if
you
can
find
that
they
are
payable
for,
for
the
purpose
of
taxes,
they're
trying
to
fix
the
tax
here.
the
husband
doesn't
have
to
go
on
and
do
this
as
he
did.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
this
is
a
termination
clause.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
we're
concerned
with
what
happens
while
there
are
payments.
but
it's
a
termination
clause.
under
the
law
of
california,
under
this
agreement,
he
immediately
assumes
his
obligations
to
support
the
children.
we're
concerned
with
up
to
the
point.
now,
the
payment
all
sees
when
the
wife
remarries
then
that
terminates
the
agreement,
and
no
payments
are
made.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
terminates
the
payments.
payments
are
terminated
as
of
that
moment
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
yes,
sir.
and
the
husband
--
the
husband
assumes
his
obligations
to
support
the
children
in
the
california
law
something
that
he
cannot
escape,
something
that
he
recognizes
in
his
agreement.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
will
not
fit
the
statute
because
the
statute
says
you
must
be
determined
from
the
terms
of
the
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
right
sir
and
that's
what
--
that's
the
importance,
that's
the
point.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
the
point.
it
says
one-sixth
then
you
can
tell
exactly
how
much.
and
one
further
point,
the
payments
are
based
upon
the
gross
income
of
the
--
of
the
husband
and
of
course,
if
the
wife
does
not
have
to
pay
the
tax
upon
50%,
this
is
a
great
advantage
to
her
and
the
children,
every
year,
every
time
the
payment
is
made.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
we
certainly
do.
and
the
statute,
if
the
reduction
clause
in
this
we
think
is
the
--
is
the
final
thing.
if
the
reduction
clause
is
based
upon
the
event
that
--
that
terminates
our
obligation,
not
on
the
event
that
may
not
come
into
being
but
an
event
that
terminates
the
obligation.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
right,
sir.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
i
certainly
agree.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
absolutely.
and
as
to
--
and
as
to
certainty,
who
would
determine
what
is
a
child
support
payment?
who
would
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
yes.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
and
the
most
difficult
thing
would
be
who
would
determine
if
an
item
was
for
child
support
or
whether
this
is
for
the
good
of
the
group.
and
we
think
this
goes
to
certainly
who
would
--
who
could
decide
on
what
was
an
item,
excuse
me.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
it
implies
--
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
facet.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
a
settled
amount,
an
amount.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
fixed
an
amount
which
is
payable
for
child
support,
not
to
fix
the
amount
which
is
to
be
used.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
that's
right
sir.
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
i'm
not
sure
of
his
--
of
his
position
on
that.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
well,
that
is
not
our
argument,
your
honor.
here's
a
maximum
amount
based
upon
20%
of
her
income.
and
when
the
payment
is
made
for
the
purpose
of
determining
her
tax,
she
would
take
half
of
whatever
is
paid,
and
determine
the
tax
of
her
rate
and
the
other
half
would
not
be
income
to
her
and
could
be
deductible
by
the
husband.
it
could
be
income
to
the
husband.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
according
to
the
other
provision
in
the
agreement,
$3600
--
$3600
or
one
half
payment.
mr.
c.
guy
tadlock
for
the
purposes
of
taxation.
for
the
purposes
of
satisfying
the
statute,
for
the
purpose
of
construing
what
congress
meant
by
the
statute.
did
congress
mean
this
must
go
to
her
and
be
used
by
her?
or
did
it
mean
that
you
had
to
find
terms
that
would
fix
it
as
payable
for
that
purpose
to
be
decided
by
the
husband
the
divorce
court
or
whoever
is
interested
in
deciding
it
but
not
congress
and
not
the
commissioner.
may
it
please
the
court.
