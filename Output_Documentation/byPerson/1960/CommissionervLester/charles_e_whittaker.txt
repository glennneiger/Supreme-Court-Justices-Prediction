justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
to
say
she
may
not
have
of
any
discretion
as
between
the
beneficiaries
namely
the
children
or
that
she
may
not
have
any
--
any
discretion
to
use
the
portion
of
that
part
for
herself?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
tadlock.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
it
possible
to
--
and
logical
to
treat
her
as
a
trustee
of
the
part
for
the
children
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
would
be
the
power
of
a
trustee
with
broad
powers,
a
wide
discretion
to
use
the
money
as
the
trustee
may
think
best
for
the
beneficiaries.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
that
still
wouldn't
permit
the
trustee
to
appropriate
a
part
of
it
for
her
own
use.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
tadlock,
is
it
material
on
what
the
parties
to
the
contract
intended
as
to
who
should
pay
the
taxes
or
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
say
about
subparagraph
d
on
page
11
of
the
record
which
provides
that
after
the
first
three
years,
the
wife
has
to
get
only
such
sum
as
after
she
has
paid
the
taxes
leaves
to
$15,600
a
year?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
i'd
like
to
know
with
that
construction
how
would
you
compute
the
amount
the
husband
just
to
pay
in
that
year?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
not
in
excess
of
$15,600
after
taxes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
alright,
now,
if
that's
--
if
that
is
the
only
issue
--
excuse
me.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
would
you
say
that
that's
what
she's
to
have
left
after
she
has
paid
the
taxes
assessable
to
her?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
--
the
$15,600
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
15000
--
well,
in
this
case,
it's
20%.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
then,
this
--
this
will
help
me.
is
this
$15,600
in
your
view
her
money
or
is
that
her
money
and
the
children's
money?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
how
do
you
square
that
argument
mr.
--
how
do
you
square
that
argument
mr.
mandel?
with
the
provision
here
that
upon
marriage,
et
cetera,
of
a
child,
one-sixth
of
the
payment
ends.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
substantially,
in
the
interest
of
the
wife
and
the
children
that
the
wife
paid
the
taxes
on
her
percentage
of
the
husband's
income,
wouldn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
just
being
geared
to
a
percentage
of
his
income
and
she
would
be
a
lot
better
off
if
she
could
get
the
half
of
his
income
as
her
tax
rates,
then
she
would
be
if
she
got
a
half
of
--
of
his
earnings
after
he'd
paid
the
taxes
at
his
much
higher
rates,
is
that
right?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
she
--
she
and
the
children
get
substantially
more
money
to
put
in
their
pockets
under
your
construction?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
she
comes
out
ahead
in
the
exact
percentage
of
the
difference
between
his
tax
rate
and
hers.his
tax
rate
if
it
was
all
taxed
to
him,
they
would
be
66%.
but
i've
heard
33%
lasts.
she,
therefore,
has
comes
out
of
43%
more
money,
don't
she?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
but
isn't
it
true
mr.
mandel
though
that
the
language
in
the
instrument
at
upon
the
death
emancipation
of
the
marriage
of
the
child,
the
payment
shall
be
reduced
one-sixth
means
something.
now,
what
does
it
mean?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
does
that
then
mean
that
there
is
a
sixth
for
each
child
and
three-sixth
for
the
wife?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr
--
mr
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
tadlock,
i'd
like
to
asked
you
one
more
question
please.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
mandel's
understanding
of
what
--
how
you
interpreted
this
paragraph
d
on
record
11
namely
that
of
the
$15,600
remaining,
$7800
goes
to
the
wife
and
$7800
for
the
children?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that's
what
he
understood
your
argument
to
be.
is
that
--
is
that
your
argument?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
let's
note
this
language
just
a
minute.
that's
paragraph
d.
she
is
to
get
20%
but
not
an
excess
of
that
sum
each
year
which
after
the
payment
of
all
income
taxes
assessable
upon
the
wife,
you
emphasize
those
words
assessable
upon
the
wife
but
let's
also
emphasize
the
following
with
respect
to
the
amounts
thus
paid
to
the
wife
shall
equal
$16,500.
now,
you
construe
that
to
mean
that
there
is
a
division
between
the
wife
and
the
children?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
how
much
for
the
wife
and
how
much
for
the
children?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
that's
--
that's
exactly
mr.
mandel's
understanding
of
your
argument
that
$7800
then
goes
to
her
and
$7800
for
the
children.
