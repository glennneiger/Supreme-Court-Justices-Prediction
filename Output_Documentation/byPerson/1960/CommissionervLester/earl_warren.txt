--
petitioner,
versus
jerry
lester.
mr.
tadlock.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mandel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mandel,
would
you
tell
me
how
this
might
become
a
trap
for
--
for
the
husband?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
mr.
tadlock
said
about
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
ahead,
go
ahead
sir.
what
would
you
--
what
did
you
say
her
income
would
be
if
the
children
were
--
were
killed
the
day
after
the
agreement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
the
maximum
of
$15,000?
chief
justice
earl
warren
$50,000.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
agreement
does
say,
does
it
not,
that
this
is
to
satisfy
his
legal
obligations
for
support
of
the
wife
and
the
children
of
the
marriage?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
suppose
we
start
with
the
premise
that
this
agreement
was
for
the
support
to
--
to
discharge
his
liability
for
support
both
the
wife
and
the
children,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
was
saying
of
this
particular
language,
it
says,
"to
settle
for
all
times
their
respective
property
rights
interest,
duties
and
obligations
with
respect
to
the
each
other
and
to
arrange
by
agreement
for
making
a
periodic
payments
through
the
wife
as
and
for.
the
maintenance
and
support
for
her
and
the
aforesaid
children
of
the
parties
in
this
charge
of
the
husband's
legal
obligations
arising
out
of
or
in
connection
with
the
marital
and
family
relationship
between
the
parties."
now,
that's
certainly
kind
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
--
that
it
is
paid
--
that
there
is
money
in
there
for
the
support
of
the
children
to
satisfy
his
legal
obligation,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
now
my
point
--
my
point
was
simply
this,
now
this
doesn't
bear
on
whether
you're
right
or
whether
the
government
is
right.
but,
if
there
is
money
in
--
in
these
payments
to
take
care
of
the
children,
then,
the
only
question
is
whether
we
can
find
out
from
this
agreement
what
part
of
that
money
is
for
the
children's
support.
if
we
can
find
out,
then
he's
liable
for
that
portion
of
it.
if
we
cannot
find
out,
then
she
is
liable
for
it,
isn't
--
isn't
that
the
position
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
tadlock.
