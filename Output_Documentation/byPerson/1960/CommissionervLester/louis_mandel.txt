mr.
louis
mandel
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
pleases
the
court.
before
i
get
into
the
discussion
of
--
of
--
outside
of
the
case,
i'd
like
to
point
of
two
very
important
points.
number
one,
that
we
don't
share
the
--
the
contention
of
the
petitioner
that
under
the
weil
case,
the
wife
has
no
discretion
about
spending
the
money
on
the
children.
she
has
a
discretion,
but
it
has
to
be
spent
on
the
children.
she
can
spend
it
only
on
the
children
anyway
in
her
--
in
her
discretion
because
she
has
the
custody
of
the
children.
and
also,
i
want
to
point
out
that
under
the
ninth
circuit
ruling
in
the
eisinger
case,
their
position
is
not
correct
there
either.
because
even
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
california,
this
very
case
would
be
adjudicated
the
same
way
the
second
circuit
adjudicated
for
that
simple
reason
--
mr.
louis
mandel
--
for
that
reason.
in
the
eisinger
case,
there
--
the
whole
payment
was
a
$125
a
week.
and
if
she
remarried,
it
was
reduced
to
$62.50
a
week.
the
court
in
the
eisinger
case
held
as
in
the
budd
case
that
when
she
remarried,
the
$62.50
was
the
amount
that
was
set
aside
for
the
children.
now,
in
the
case
before
the
court
now,
that
very
point
was
avoided
because
if
she
remarries,
there
is
nothing
left
for
the
children,
although
the
custody
remains
with
the
--
with
the
wife,
they
were
afraid
possibly
there
might
be
an
adjudication
or
might
be
stretching
the
statutes
somewhere
along
the
line
to
the
point
where
they
would
not
treat
these
alimonies
so
everything
ceases
the
moment
she
remarries
so
that
this
alimony.
in
other
words,
the
budd
case
had
$500
a
week
--
a
$500
a
month
that
was
reduced
to
$200
a
month
in
case
she
remarried.
and
they
held
that
$200
a
month
was
for
the
children.
again,
the
same
principle
in
this
case,
nothing
is
left
when
she
remarries.
so
we're
not
--
in
--
in
contradiction
to
the
eisinger
case
in
the
--
in
the
ninth
circuit,
now
i'll
go
on
with
more
of
these
cases
but
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
my
case.
mr.
louis
mandel
i
can
square
that
by
the
simple
intent
of
the
whole
agreement.
the
intent
of
the
whole
agreement
was
to
state
within
section
22
(k)
as
i
will
expand
my
whole
--
my
whole
case
when
i
--
when
i
--
and
the
only
--
the
only
reason
they
--
they
recognized
and
the
law
doesn't
prohibit
that
and
the
history
of
the
statute
when
congress
will
prove
my
point
too.
that
the
--
the
exchange
between
the
people
that
take
care
of
this
situation
didn't
prohibit
any
change
in
the
payment.
for
instance,
if
she
went
to
florida
and
lived
there,
there
was
no
cold
or
there
was
no
--
no
need
for
schooling
or
supposing
they
had
decided
that
during
college
years
of
the
children
that
so
much
would
be
paid
increased
to
decreased
or
part
of
the
money
were
to
be
spent
and
given
to
the
child
for
college.
all
of
these
didn't
prohibit
--
these
changes
were
not
prohibited
at
all
as
long
as
you
didn't
allocate
and
then
fix
them
for
the
children
in
the
overall
agreement.
in
other
words,
we
could
change
if
it's
cold,
heavy
winter,
we
could
have
more
money
if
college
--
kids
--
the
child
that
was
to
go
to
college,
we
could
provide
conditions
under
which
they
would
increase
or
decrease
because
it
was
built
on
the
family
need
the
whole
overall.
and
when
we
examined
the
whole
thing
in
light
of
the
--
of
the
history
of
the
statute,
when
the
practice
of
the
statute,
i
think
all
this
would
become
very
clear.
i
think,
when
we
--
the
first
thing
i
--
i
must
say
that
--
and
to
start
my
--
my
argument,
i
--
if
this
statute,
i
--
i
will
cover
it
in
five
points.
first,
we'll
discuss
the
statute.
if
this
--
if
one
approaches
this
statute
with
sincerity
and
simplicity
and
doesn't
want
to
read
anything
into
it,
they
must
come
away
with
the
meaning
that
congress
intended.
and
that
this
disagreement
before
the
court
was
in
--
within
the
purview
of
the
statute.
using
--
using
the
language
of
judge
hand
in
--
in
talking
about
the
statute,
he
said,
"the
statute
is
plain
language
patently
chosen
with
care."
now,
if
you'll
approach
the
statute
from
that
point
of
view
with
simplicity
and
sincerity,
it
does
not
show
any
complications
until
you
come
to
the
word
fix.
when
you
come
to
the
word
fix,
then
again
if
you
lose
your
simplicity
and
sincerity,
you
can
get
confuse
very
much
about
it.
but
what
congress
meant
was
to
fix
the
amount
for
the
support
of
the
--
of
the
children.
now,
fix
means
fix.
in
other
words,
if
you
want
to
give
$500
amount
to
--
to
the
wife,
you
gave
a
$500,
you
said
a
$100
was
for
the
support
of
the
children,
that
would
fix
it.
congress
did
not
mean
when
they
created
the
statute
to
create
a
track
for
the
taxpayer
that
he
could
fall
and
to
be
ruined
financially
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
it
did
not
mean
for
--
for
the
taxpayer
to
get
into
a
separation
agreement
where
any
agent
who
is
so
inclined
would
examine
it
with
a
microscope,
and
using
the
--
the
words
of
the
--
of
the
weil
case,
say
comes
through
the
agreement
with
such
care
to
find
a
word
or
sentence
that
it
could
hang
on
the
word
fixed
and
then
brought
and
fixed
from
its
original
intention.
this
was
not
the
intention
of
the
statute
and
it
becomes
much
more
apparent
when
you
go
into
the
history
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
louis
mandel
yes,
i
would.
you're
under
the
impression
you're
going
within
--
within
the
purview
of
22
(k).
and
you
draw
such
a
separation
agreement
because
the
statute
permits
you
to
give
an
amount,
a
whole
amount
to
the
wife
for
everything
with
--
and
it
shall
be
alimony,
it
doesn't
prohibit.
that
is
the
history
of
the
statute
and
i'll
point
out
later
intended.
so,
if
--
if
an
agent
could
go
through
an
agreement
and
find
some
little
thing
that
is
so
contrary
to
the
whole
intention,
and
then
say
this
means
fixed
when
it's
not
fixed,
and
brought
it
from
its
original
intention
fixed
as
fixed
a
$100
for
the
support
of
the
child,
$200
for
the
support
of
the
child.
not
a
case
where
you
reduce
a
payment
and
you
say
that's
for
the
support
of
the
child.
so,
therefore,
if
--
it
opens
broadness
there
that
any
--
any
agent
could
go
in
there
and
find
the
sentence
or
word
that
he
can
say
this
fixes
it.
and
then
use
that
as
a
means
and
then
the
taxpayer
finds
himself
in
the
situation
as
again,
i
will
show
in
the
history
of
the
tax
of
the
purpose
of
this
statute
that
he
has
--
he's
in
the
big
surtax
bracket
and
he
hasn't
got
enough
money
to
pay
the
taxes.
if
this
court
will
permit
me
to
get
into
the
history
of
the
statute
and
how
it
came
about,
i
think
a
lot
of
these
answer
will
--
will
come
out.
the
history
of
the
statute
and
the
purposes
was
three-fold.
they
were
aid
to
relieve
a
tax
burden
the
existed
for
such
families
that
were
separated
and
divorced.
and
now
had
greater
expenses
and
they
had
before
and
yet
they
didn't
have
the
advantage
of
the
family
tax
bracket.
in
other
words,
since
we're
separate
living
apart
under
the
tax
rule,
they
had
a
single
status
even
though
they
were
married
and
even
had
more
expense
because
the
two
families
will
be
having
more
--
two
homes
instead
of
one
before.
two,
it
was
created
for
the
purpose
of
the
maximum
that
the
recipient
of
the
money
shall
pay
the
taxes.
in
other
words,
the
principle
was
that
the
husband
was
just
a
conduit
for
which
--
through
which
the
--
the
wife
got
his
money
that
is
if
he
earned
it,
but
she
got
all
the
money
so
the
principle
that
the
recipient
of
the
money
should
pay
the
taxes,
that
was
another
reason
for
which
it
was
created,
the
record
will
show.
and
the
third
reason
it
was
created,
because
of
the
surtax
situation.
in
other
words,
they
conceive
the
situation
whereby
some
allowance
or
some
agreement
where
the
husband
would
give
so
much
away
that
his
surtax
brackets
were
so
high
that
if
that
amount
were
not
deductible
from
him
and
the
tax
on
it
was
payable
by
the
wife,
that
he
wouldn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
the
taxes
on
the
whole
amount.
if
that
part
of
it
payable
to
wife
--
to
the
wife
were
not
charged
to
the
wife.
now,
these
are
the
three
reasons
in
the
history
of
it
shows,
may
i
point
to
three
parts
of
the
congressional
record
where
this
very
problem
was
--
was
discussed
and
confronted
and
this
very
purpose.
it
turns
to
page
8
of
our
brief.
it
has
--
page
6
of
our
brief.
it
has
the
report
of
the
senate
committee
and
that
--
may
i
read
it.
it
reads
as
follows.
"if
however,
the
periodic
payments
and
the
trust
income
are
more
conceived
by
the
wife
for
the
support
and
maintenance
of
herself
and
of
minor
children
of
the
husband
without
such
a
specific
designation
of
the
portion
for
the
support
of
such
children,
then
the
whole
of
such
amount
is
includible
in
the
income
of
the
wife
as
provided
in
section
22
(k)
and
in
section
171."
now,
further
down,
we
also
have
another
portion
which
--
which
came
out
in
the
hearings
on
this
question
and
it's
in
the
footnote.
"if
however,
that
amount
paid
the
wife
includes
support
of
children,
but
no
amount
is
specified
for
the
support
of
the
children,
the
entire
amount
goes
into
the
income
of
the
wife."
this
is
part
of
--
of
the
senate's
record
and
this
is
a
part
--
this
is
a
very
question
that
they
discussed
at
that
point
and
part
of
the
free
reasons
for
enacting
the
statute.
now,
that's
the
reason
for
the
statute
and
the
reason
for
not
complicating
the
word
fix
that's
there,
as
judge
hand
said
it's
a
simple
word.
now,
let
us
turn
to
the
agreement
that's
before
the
court.
the
agreement
before
the
court
intends
to
stay
within
the
purview
of
this
statute
and
i
will
list
the
things
it
did
and
the
intentions
manifested
in
the
agreement
for
--
for
that
purpose.
number
one,
it
pays
as
high
as
50%,
it
starts
out
as
paying
as
high
as
50%
of
the
gross
income
of
the
husband.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
his
expenses,
his
taxes
on
--
on
file
in
this
case
run
over
40%
of
his
income.
now,
50
and
40
that
means
he
had
left
less
than
9%
for
his
state
and
federal
taxes.
if
he
will
burden
on
any
part
of
the
wife's
50%,
he
never
could
made
his
taxes,
he
had
nothing
left
for
himself.
so,
the
very
intention
in
the
payments
at
the
beginning
indicates
that.
number
two,
there's
a
paragraph
that
refers
to
taxes
in
the
agreement
and
it
says
for
--
up
to
the
point
of
this
agreement,
they
shall
file
a
joint
return.
after
this
agreement,
they
shall
file
separate
returns
each
reporting
their
own
income.
now,
the
--
the
intention
was
the
very
intention
put
together
with
number
one
was
that
she
was
to
report
the
money
that
she
--
she
got
and
he
was
to
report
the
money
he
was
left
with.
three,
it
provides
that
she
pay
the
taxes
on
that
money.
and
my
worthy
opponent
is
a
little
-
is
torturing
that
section
of
payment
of
taxes
as
that
was
brought
out
by
judge
whittaker
by
trying
to
say
--
justice
whittaker
by
trying
to
say
that
$15,600
that
she
was
to
get
after
payment
of
taxes,
he
wants
to
now
to
say
she
was
going
to
get
not
$15,600
but
she
was
going
to
get
$7800
tax
free
and
$7800
after
she
paid
the
taxes.
now,
the
agreement
doesn't
indicate
anything
like
that.
mr.
louis
mandel
he
--
he
indicated
and
say
--
he
indicated
that
the
$15,600
was
to
be
broken
up
if
that's
his
contention,
half
of
it
was
--
was
child
support
which
should
be
charged,
the
wife
had
no
tax
to
pay.
so
a
$7800,
you
break
up
to
$7800
as
child
support,
as
$7800
will
remain
as
her
alimony
in
which
he
would
pay
the
taxes.
he
refers
to
that
tax
clause
that
she
would
only
pay
on
taxes
that
would
leave
us
$7800
and
not
$15,600.
that
--
that's
what
i
understood
him
to
--
to
say
from
his
brief
and
so
forth.
now,
one
other
important
thing
they
did.
this
agreement
--
this
agreement
takes
care
of
--
of
the
custody
of
the
children
permanently
and
a
many
other
things.
but,
they
were
so
concerned
in
--
in
drawing
of
this
agreement
that
rather
than
--
than
confront
the
problem
that
anything
might
be
--
in
this
agreement
might
be
treated
differently
than
alimony,
they
treated
the
whole
sum
to
the
wife
payable
as
alimony.
in
other
words,
when
the
marital
obligation
cease,
when
the
wife
was
married
again,
it
all
disappeared.
and
although
a
lot
of
other
things
are
taking
care
of,
the
child
--
the
children
are
left
--
there's
no
provision
for
their
support
because
rather
than
do
that,
rather
than
to
take
a
chance
of
putting
any
amount
that
they
would
finally
later
on
agree
or
--
or
litigate
about,
they
avoided
that
whole
issue
in
order
not
to
have
that
question
tortured
at
all
as
for
that
the
whole
thing
would
go
out
as
--
as
alimonies.
mr.
louis
mandel
i
believe
they
were
11
--
mr.
louis
mandel
--
11
--
13
or
around
that,
11
or
13.
so
there
was
no
question.
now,
there's
another
point
also
that
--
that
there
is
a
maximum
payment
here
in
this
agreement
that
the
wife
gets.
she
gets
$15,600
ultimate
maximum
payment
and
a
15
--
and
she
gets
a
maximum
payment
at
the
beginning
which
rounds
as
high
as
50%.
now
--
mr.
louis
mandel
that's
right,
that's
now.
now,
if
the
children
had
died
in
the
common
disaster,
a
day
after
this
agreement,
this
maximum
would
remain
the
same.
this
$15,600
would
remain
the
same.
this
50%
payment
would
remain
the
same.
it's
only
the
payments
to
her
that
was
never
reduction.
in
other
words,
they
try
to
avoid
as
much
possible
the
word
"fix"
in
other
--
in
order
to
get
away
from
it.
so,
the
only
thing
they
were
left
with
and
the
whole
agreement
was
that
they're
realizing
that
the
--
that
the
times,
the
needs
and
the
circumstances
a
method
of
--
of
reducing
the
payments
one-sixth
at
a
certain
point.
now
--
now
also,
the
part
of
it
again,
there's
another
point
which
in
itself
is
not
important
but
in
the
attempt
of
the
overall
agreement
is
important.
mr.
louis
mandel
her
maximum
income
would
be
50
--
would
be
$50,000,
the
day
after
her
maximum
would
still
remain
$50,000.
the
payments
that
he
had
to
make
the
percentage
payments
would
be
reduced.
but
the
maximum
remained
constant.
in
other
words,
that
was
never
--
mr.
louis
mandel
of
$50,000,
the
first
year.
mr.
louis
mandel
later
on,
after
the
third
year,
remained
to
$15,600.
mr.
louis
mandel
and
if
the
children
would
all
--
all
in
a
common
disaster
on
the
third
year,
she
would
still
get
$15,600
if
he
earned
enough
on
20%
to
give
a
$15,000
whatever
it
was
to
the
percentage
he
was
entitled
to
get
to
give
a
$15,600.
that
wasn't
changed.
there
is
one
further
important
point
which
in
itself
is
not
important.
but
it
--
it
goes
to
the
word
"fixed."
and
it
also
--
and
it
encompasses
the
question
that's
presented
from
the
weil
case.
although,
the
--
the
children
are
in
the
custody
of
the
wife,
when
they're
away
from
her,
even
though
the
agreement
provides
that
they
have
spent
30
--
30
days
a
year
with
the
father
in
new
york,
there
is
never
a
change
in
the
payments
that
go
to
hers.
she
gets
the
same
thing.
there's
never
a
reduction,
nothing
changes
ever.
she
gets
the
same
money.
so,
nothing
here
is
fixed
for
the
support
of
the
children
and
of
course,
the
admission
by
everyone
that
she
has
free
use
of
the
money,
i
mean
no
one
except
you
--
you
bring
to
the
court
and
say
she's
not
taking
care
of
the
children,
she
has
complete
discretion
as
to
how
she'd
use
it
whether
she
buy
a
house
or
--
or
she
wanted
to
go
to
las
vegas
or
whatever
she
wanted
to
do.
mr.
louis
mandel
that's
right.
mr.
louis
mandel
if
that's
right,
the
whole
--
the
whole
structure
is
built
so
the
--
the
family
unit
would
have
the
best
advantage
of
the
gross
income
so
that
they
will
take
advantage
of
this
divided
income
so
that
he
is
not
left
with
--
with
the
whole
gross
amount.
the
whole
gross
amount
in
charge
with
a
--
with
a
surtax
that
would
do
no
one
any
good,
as
a
single
man.
mr.
louis
mandel
oh,
yes.
it's
the
whole
intention
of
the
agreement.
i
--
i
failed
to
mention
that.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
overall
agreement
must
to
accomplish
that
which
the
court
permitted
in
the
history
of
the
statute
permitted
them
to
do,
to
take
whatever
his
earnings
up
divided
as
well
as
they
could
among
the
people
in
their
own
judgment
where
the
tax
would
bring
them
into
lower
brackets.
mr.
louis
mandel
well
--
well,
he
might
be
correct
on
this
if
--
if
we
selfishly
tear
this
away
and
she
has
no
more
interest
in
the
overall
picture
of
the
man
and
--
and
he's
ability
to
earn
and
his
desire
to
earn
and
to
destroy
all
that
because
the
more
he
earns,
the
more
she
gets
tax
free,
and
the
worst
all
he
is.
he
may
as
well
point
of
a
certain
point
and
go.
mr.
louis
mandel
oh,
if
--
if
--
that's
right,
oh
yes.
if
--
if
the
purpose
of
the
agreements
are
lost
and
that
--
and
she
can
--
she
can
escape
this
but
she
--
the
purpose
indicates,
yes.
she's
--
shes'
better
off.
mr.
louis
mandel
well,
i
--
i
can
only
reduce
it
to
the
simple
formula.
i
think
you're
right
that
the
simple
formula
that
anyone
can
get
$7800
as
this
would
finally
reduce
that
itself
in
--
in
the
third
year
to
tax
free
money,
they
are
certainly
better
off
no
matter
what
his
bracket
is
because
they
are
no
more
burden
whether
it's
20
or
50
or
80.
if
you
can
interpret
this
agreement,
where
she
ends
up
on
that
$15,600
that
you
mentioned
before,
where
she
can
get
that
tax-free,
of
course
she's
better
off
no
matter
what
his
percentage
is.
she
already
gets
half
of
the
money
she
gets
tax-free.
now,
i
mentioned
--
i
think
i
mentioned
the
--
i
said
a
little
while
ago
that
under
the
--
the
rulings
urged
by
the
commissioner
in
the
budd
case
and
the
eisinger
case
and
the
metcalf
case
and
the
fischer
case,
under
all
these
cases,
all
these
cases
eventually
end
up
where
the
amount
which
is
allocated
for
the
support
of
the
children
is
what
is
left
to
be
paid
by
the
husband
after
the
wife
remarries.
this
is
the
general
overall
result.
and
if
we
were
to
apply
the
same
principle
as
it
is
applied
in
the
budd
and
the
fischer
and
the
metcalf,
without
going
into
details
because
i
can
give
you
the
details
of
each
one
of
them,
the
budd
500,
200
is
left
after
--
after
she
remarries,
200
held.
eisinger
case,
125,
6250
left
after
she
remarries,
62
they
held
fixed.
the
fischer
case,
125
left
after
remarried,
a
125,
it
was
held.
the
metcalf
case,
a
100
--
125
left
after
she
remarried,
125
was
held
for
the
support
of
the
children.
in
our
case,
we
went
along
the
very
line
that
the
commissioner
has
urged.
we
have
nothing
left
that
she
remarries.
she
remarries
the
day
after
a
week
after
this
agreement.
no
money
is
paid
under
this
agreement.
mr.
louis
mandel
well,
i
--
i
cannot
say.
i
--
i
--
all
i
can
say
in
all
sincerity,
it
means
this
that
they
wanted
a
way
to
cut
down
the
--
the
payments.
they
wanted
some
method
time.
they
wanted
some
method
to
cut
down.
they
chose
this
as
the
best
method
to
cut
it
down.
mr.
louis
mandel
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
louis
mandel
i
cannot
urge
that
because
the
agreement
did
not
intend
that
it
would
be
that
way.
she's
not
obligated
to
spend
it
that
way.
it
was
never
their
intention
all
through
it,
not
they
would
have
said
so
somewhere
along
the
line
of
60s
for
their
support
of
the
child.
it
only
finds
its
way
and
i
have
to
get
back
again
or
repeat
myself
to
the
very
thing
that
i
urged
at
the
very
beginning
that
we
--
we
can't
have
a
law
or
--
it
was
not
the
intention
of
congress
to
create
a
law
that
--
that
you
can
go
through
--
go
to
an
instrument
with
a
--
with
a
fine
tone
and
a
microscope
and
then
later,
will
find
something
to
hang
--
hang
on
and
say,
"now,
you
can't
talk
to
any
reductions
at
all.
the
moment
you
reduce
the
payments,
you're
in
trouble."
mr.
louis
mandel
that's
right.
it
was
intended
to
be
simple.
we're
now
urging
it
and
pressing
in
to
a
different
form.
mr.
louis
mandel
it's
very
definite.
you
can't
--
if
i
reduce
something,
you
know,
i
said
--
if
its
winter
time,
you
get
$20
less
or
you
go
to
live
with
your
--
you
know,
you
can't
call
that
fixed
it,
if
all
through
the
agreement
you're
trying
to
avoid
that
very
thing.
mr.
louis
mandel
yes,
but
the
statute
was
enacted
for
that
very
purpose
and
as
i
told
it
the
history
in
the
senate
and
the
hearings
for
that
very
purpose
that
he
could
do
that.
that
very
question
came
up
in
the
senate.
could
he
do
that?
and
yes,
they
said
this
is
exactly
what
happens.
as
long
as
he
doesn't
fix
it
or
specific
about
the
amount,
he
can
give
her
a
lonesome
of
money
for
all
purposes
and
his
charge
as
alimony.
mr.
louis
mandel
well,
she
--
she
might
not
--
yes,
she
might
not
claim
--
if
he
gave
us
a
efficiency
she
might
--
this
might
protect
him
against
that,
yes.
mr.
louis
mandel
that's
right
and
i
say
to
you
--
mr.
louis
mandel
i
--
i
guess
i
agree
with
that
but
i
urge
that
the
statute
gave
that
right
to
the
--
to
this
right
to
go
into
an
agreement,
the
history
of
the
statute
gave
them
that
right
to
do
it
that
way.
mr.
louis
mandel
no.
i
respectively
submit
that
this
is
not
so
--
mr.
louis
mandel
--
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
intention
of
--
the
statute
was
created.
the
history
shows
it
was
intended
to
do
that
very
thing
to
give
the
wife
money
for
both
purposes
chargeable
to
her.
and
if
we
search
the
statute
and
say,
"well,
that
means
he
did
he
give
her"
of
course
he
did.
but,
it
said
he
could
give
her
and
that
it
is
chargeable
to
her
and
if
we
tried
them
to
search
with
the
strength
of
the
very
--
the
purpose
in
the
history
of
the
statute.
mr.
louis
mandel
i
don't
think
so
because
unless
you
go
very
hard
and
say
that
--
no,
i
don't
think
you
can.
mr.
louis
mandel
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
louis
mandel
my
reading
with
it
--
i
don't
think
so.
i
know
you
can
ascertain
that
the
reduction
but
you
cannot
say
ascertaining
amount
that's
got
to
go
for
the
support
of
the
children.
mr.
louis
mandel
one-sixth,
yes.
mr.
louis
mandel
not
a
single
thing
there
because
she's
not
obligated,
and
i
can't
see
anything
there.
no,
i
must
--
and
my
answer
must
be
no.
mr.
louis
mandel
there's
one
other
thing
i
just
want
to
say
about
the
california
lore
about
this
--
this
contract
is
under
the
california
lore.
i
don't
see
what
does
has
to
do
with
taxes
in
22
(k)
and
the
rights
under
22
(k).
