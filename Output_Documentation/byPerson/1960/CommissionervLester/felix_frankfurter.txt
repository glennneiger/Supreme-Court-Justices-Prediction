but
suppose
you
take
--
suppose
you
take
the
chief
justice's
starting
point
that
if
we
can
find
out
from
the
agreement
that
money
was
designed
for
the
children,
suppose
you
accept
that
as
a
starting
point,
can
we
find
out
from
this
agreement
what
moneys
were
designed
for
the
children?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
your
answer
is
no,
then
you
--
then
you
meet
the
chief
--
even
the
chief
justice's
test
or
inquiry
rather.
the
chief
justice
asks
you
if
we
can
find
out
from
the
agreement,
i
take
it
that
that
question
means,
does
the
agreement
set
aside
some
ascertainable
amount?
and
if
it
does
set
aside
an
ascertainable
amount,
that
would
be
fixed,
wouldn't
it,
even
ascertainable
amount
the
same
thing
as
fixed?
but
does
this
agreement,
can
you
gather
from
this
agreement
an
ascertainable
amount
which
has
to
go
to
the
children
wiley
niley?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
reading
the
document
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
reading
the
document,
can
you
from
the
document
extract
what
--
what
and
why
must
allocate
to
the
children?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
--
does
the
case
get
down
to
this,
the
government
contends
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
reduction
clause
and
a
define
the
percentage
of
reduction
from
that
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
that
during
the
lifetime
of
the
children
that
proportion
was
to
be
allocated
to
them.
that's
the
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
they
--
and
you
think
that's
the
fairest
construction
of
the
document?
justice
felix
frankfurter
rather
than
--
rather
than
--
you
don't
make
it
just
as
plausible
or
just
as
fair
to
say
but
certainly,
the
wife
has
the
obligation
--
she
has
the
custody,
she
has
certain
obligations.
presumably,
if
you
have
to
support,
if
you
have
to
feed
in
any
family
one
mouth
or
two
mouths
of
less,
and
close
them,
there
is
some
differences
in
--
in
the
incidence
that
--
or
the
burdens
on
the
available
performance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but,
isn't
it
a
jump
to
say
that
because
of
the
calculation
of
what
the
reduction,
the
amount
of
reduction
should
be,
that
money
is
set
aside
so
that
the
mother
can't
use
it
in
a
different
way.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
crude
way
--
the
reduction
is
a
crude
guessing
of
outsiders
of
what
she
is
entitled
to
make
a
very
specific
disposition
of.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
could
easily
be
fixed
if
you
wanted
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
to
make
it
certain.
if
you
wanted
to
restrict
the
wife
so
that
you
shouldn't
spend
unduly
on
her
clothes,
and
by
--
and
stint
the
children's
clothes
which
is
a
conceivable
thing
about
women,
it
could
be
easily
done.
it
doesn't
require
great
ingenuity
--
it
doesn't
require
great
(inaudible)
to
think
of
that
nor
great
ingenuity
to
praise
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
fix
--
the
word
fix.
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
word
fix
carried
within
a
--
swish
her
tail,
isn't
appeared
for
the
comment
that
fixed
implies
fixity?
i
mean,
the
word
fix
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
thought
fixing
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
is
not
this
crude
calculation
that
the
government
consists
on
or
must
rely
on
namely,
we'll
make
a
guess
that
if
a
child
dies,
he
only
had
one-sixth
for
the
respondent.
would
you
call
that
an
ordinary
use
of
language
or
you
call
that
a
fixed
amount?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
statute
is
fixed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no.
but
the
fixed
--
the
definiteness
comes
in
to
be
when
the
child
dies
not
when
the
use
of
the
money
is
