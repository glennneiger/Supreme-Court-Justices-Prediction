mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
society,
it
is
important
to
understand
in
explanation
of
the
way
the
court
below
proceeded
just
exactly
what
was
for.
there
--
this
--
the
decree
in
existence
when
this
started
was
the
1950
decree
and
of
course,
the
present
decree
which
is
now
less
attack
represents
a
very
real
amelioration
of
that
decree
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
very
interest
that
does
the
appellant
here.
now,
the
government
desired
to
most
stringently
enforced
second
provisions
of
the
1950
decree
and
to
have
these
more
stringent
enforcements
implemented
in
a
new
and
more
specific
decree.
so
that
on
the
question
of
voting
and
on
the
question
of
objective
standards
for
the
reward,
for
the
playing
of
music,
something
more
would
exist
than
what
existed
under
the
1950
decree.
that
was
--
was
derived
at
by
negotiation
between
the
department
of
justice
and
ascap,
and
the
matter
was
then
presented
to
chief
judge
ryan
who
was
the
chief
judge
to
whom
the
ascap
case
had
been
assigned
for
some
three
or
more
years
and
who
was
in
charge
of
the
enforcement
of
the
price
determining
terms
of
that
decree
as
well
as
of
all
other
portions
of
the
decree.
in
other
words,
he
was
well-versed
in
the
matters
of
the
1950
decree
and
ascap
affairs.
now,
when
the
decree
was
presented
to
judge
ryan,
it
was
presented
to
him
as
a
consent
decree,
and
he
immediately
realized
and
stated,
as
we
think
is
right,
that
he
could
not
alter
the
consents
of
the
parties
that
his
office
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
such
a
consent
decree
would
further
implement
the
achievement
of
the
antitrust
purpose
of
the
original
complaint
and
the
two
earlier
decrees.
that
was
what
the
judge
conceived
to
be
before
him.
that,
i
submit,
is
what
it
was
before
him.
however,
he
also
realized
that
the
basic
nature
of
the
proceeding
would
be
transmogrified
if
evidence
were
taken.
he
considered
that
point
when
the
matter
was
first
brought
to
him,
if
the
making
of
the
rules
to
show
cause.
the
government's
counsel
asked
him
whether
he
would
take
evidence,
and
he
said,
as
would
any
judge,
"perhaps,
i
don't
know.
i'll
think
about
it."
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
yes.
so
that
it
wasn't
just
slipping
right
over
it
and
passing
the
point
without
consideration.
this
is
a
very
experienced
judge,
our
chief
judge.
when
the
matter
was
finally
presented
to
him
some
10
days
later,
i
think
the
judges'
thinking
had
moved
further.
and
certainly
by
the
october
hearing,
after
the
decree
in
post
form
had
been
mailed
to
all
of
the
members
after
the
government's
press
release
with
respect
to
the
proceedings,
had
been
mailed
to
all
the
members
and
after
there
had
been
communication
of
the
ideas
of
the
sam
fox
company
to
the
court.
the
court
realized
that
if
evidence
were
taken,
you
would
no
longer
have
a
consent
proceeding
of
the
kind
that
would
be
free
of
menace
to
ascap
because
it
would
no
longer
come
within
the
language
of
section
5
of
the
clayton
act
as
being
a
consent
judgment
in
a
case
in
which
no
testimony
had
been
taken.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
on
the
framing
of
a
decree?
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
--
as
i
recall
the
section,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
taking
evidence
to
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
--
seek
someone's
expertise.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
no,
if
someone's
expertise,
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
--
and
i
don't
think
it
would
hurt.
i
think
it's
the
witness
taking
an
oath
and
testifying
to
facts
that
is
created
of
the
section
5
risk.
if
i
may
show
it
formed
call
of
that.
now,
that
was
the
problem
before
the
court.
the
second
stage
of
the
court's
analysis
was
this,
that
if
the
consent
decree
were
rejected,
the
government,
having
manifested
its
dissatisfaction
with
the
then
current
situation
of
compliance
and
strengthening
of
enforcement,
would
move
on
to
seek
modifications
of
the
earlier
decree.
in
so
seeking
modification
of
the
earlier
decree,
it
would
be
incumbent
on
the
government
to
prove
violation,
and
the
whole
case
would
be
wide
open
for
proof
on
all
premises.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
in
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
inadequacy
of
provision
from
supervening
circumstances,
change
in
the
society
and
all
that.but
judge
ryan's
conception
of
it,
and
everybody
was
offering
to
brief
among
this
point,
nobody
did,
and
i
fear
there
isn't
anymore
that's
controlling
in
any
event.
he
was
uncertain
that
since
a
consent
decree
can
only
be
modified
in
compliance
with
the
antitrust
law,
it
must
be
rooted
in
something
more
than
consent
provision
that
must
be
rooted
in
some
holding
with
respect
to
antirust
violation,
hence
the
basic
problem.
now,
he
did
not
proceed
in
any
other
way
than
the
way
in
which
an
experienced
and
seasoned
judge
would.
he
sought
note
--
a
required
notice,
and
he
did
seek
the
assistance
and
the
advice
of
those
competent
to
counsel
him
including
mr.
horsky
who
did.
now,
the
difficulty
on
the
intervention
point,
if
i
may
say
so,
your
honor,
is
this,
that
the
pleading
and
intervention
is
what
establishes
the
fact
of
intervention,
and
the
courts
have
indicated
in
the
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
that
no
affidavits,
no
vast
showing
should
accompany
a
petition
to
intervene,
a
notice
of
motion
and
the
pleading
in
intervention.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
it
should
set
forth
a
claim
or
defense
which
you
believe
will
be
concluded
by
the
judgment
in
the
action.
now,
apparently,
it
should
not
set
forth
an
argument
about
why
you
should
be
allowed
to
intervene
factually.
and
it
looks
as
though
the
presentation
of
the
pleading
of
intervention
establishes
intervention
without
first
requiring
the
proposed
intervenor
to
adduce
evidence
of
inadequacy
of
representation
or
of
these
other
factors.
so
that
once
the
petition
to
intervenors
presented,
it
must
be
passed
on.
this
one
was
passed
on
adversely
in
the
circumstances
that
i
have
described
to
your
honor,
and
it
set
forth
critiques
of
the
proposed
decree
phrased
much
as
mr.
horsky
has
phrased
them
here
today
and
implying
the
availability
of
such
evidence
as
he
implied
the
availability
throughout
the
hearing
that
they
could
be
backed
up
with
evidence
of
the
sought
that
he
has
in
substance
by
his
argument
here
today
epitomize
to
the
court.
i
think
the
court
could
be
confident
that
an
experienced
judge
hearing
this
and
other
criticisms
in
a
full
and
open
hearing,
if
he
had
a
court
that
wait
to
them,
if
he
had
thought,
as
your
honor
put
the
question,
"can
i,
in
my
judicial
mind,
demerge
to
this
and
still
feel
that
i
am
right,
then
i
will
sign
the
decree,
otherwise
not."
i
think
we
must
assume
that
that
is
the
process
that
went
on
in
judge
ryan's
mind.
now,
i
would
like
to
say,
your
honor,
that
we
do
not,
for
our
part,
concede
that
the
appeal
is
properly
here
in
the
presence
of
two
distinguished
experts
on
the
law
of
this
court.
we
have
its
narrative
to
suggest
that
the
appeal
should
be
dismissed.
this
is
an
appeal
under
section
2
of
the
expediting
act.
that
act
suffers
appeals
only
from
the
final
judgment.
it
is
intended
to
cut
out
interlocutory
appeals
no
matter
how
significant
or
momentous.
and
we
submit
that
the
decisions
in
this
court
particularly
the
allen
calculators
case
in
322
u.s.
137
and
california
canaries
require
that
the
appeal
be
dismissed
because
it
is
not
an
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
and
is
deliberately
not
such
an
appeal.
now,
we
do
not
deny
that
appealable
subject
matter
is
present
when
intervention
as
a
right
is
denied
or
conceivably,
when
an
abuse
of
discretion
is
exerted
in
denying
intervention.
we
think
that
the
expression
was
in
this
court
in
such
a
case
as
the
sutphen
case
indicating
that
appeal
lies
as
a
right
relate
to
appealable
subject
matter
and
not
the
mode
or
occasion
of
appeal.
in
the
sutphen
case,
the
appeal
was
from
the
final
judgment.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
appellants,
we
submit,
have
not
met
the
second
requirement
of
rule
24
(a)
(2)
by
showing
that
they
are
or
may
be
bound
by
the
judgment
in
question.
we
join
the
solicitor
general's
argument
to
this
effect
made
at
pages
56
to
61
of
his
brief.
now,
appellants'
hint,
at
page
12
of
their
reply
brief,
that
both
appellant
pleasant
music
and
the
society
have
acknowledged
in
the
pleadings
in
the
state
court
case
between
them
that
both
are
bound
by
the
1950
decree.
they
mistake
the
pleading.
it
is
only
that
since
1950,
the
society
has
incorporated
in
each
agreement
with
each
member
a
stamp
legend
stating
that
the
grant
of
the
owner's
performing
rights
to
the
society
in
the
agreement
is
modified
and
set
by
and
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
1941
and
1950
decrees
and
this
corresponding
provisions
of
the
society's
articles
and
board
resolutions.
now,
that
allegation
in
the
society
admitted
for
the
stamp
simply
conform
the
new
contract
forms
to
limit
the
society's
acquisitions
of
copyright
right
--
rights
in
conformity
with
the
decree.
now,
appellants,
we
submit,
are
not
bound
by
the
decree
for
several,
clear
and
familiar
reasons,
first,
whether
or
not
the
1941
complaint
was
a
representative
complaint
against
the
membership
as
a
class.
the
1941
judgment
ran
only
against
the
society
and
extended
as,
of
course,
to
directors,
officers,
employees,
members
and
all
persons
acting
on
the
society's
behalf.
the
1950
decree
applies
only
to
the
society
and
officers,
directors
and
employees
and
all
other
persons,
including
members,
acting
under,
through
or
for
the
society.
the
1960
decree
leaves
that
provision
unchanged.
thus,
appellants
are
neither
parties
to
the
decrees
nor
members
of
a
class
represented
by
parties
against
whom
the
decree
runs
representatively.
second,
all
three
decrees
were
made
without
taking
any
testimony
and
all
are
expressly
without
any
findings
of
fact
or
admission
of
or
adjudication
of
violation
of
law.
the
decrees,
thus,
have
no
adjudicative
content
that
could
bind
the
right
or
interest
of
a
non-party.
third,
there
are
no
issues
in
the
case
as
between
appellants
and
the
other
members
of
the
society
or
the
society
as
a
whole,
but
only
the
consent
decree
disposition
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
may
i,
your
honor?
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
but
only
the
consent
decree
disposition
of
the
public
antitrust
claims
of
the
united
states
against
the
society,
thus,
making
inapplicable
such
cases
as
ben-hur
and
the
modern
woodmen
case
which
depend
on
the
adjudication
of
the
society
member
issue
not
present
here.
i
respectfully
submit
the
appeal
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
it
--
no,
your
honor
--
of
course,
in
complete
disregard
of
the
decree,
as
in
--
the
court
said
in
the
borden
case
in
this
court,
because
the
decree
deals
with
the
public
right
of
the
united
states
against
the
society
as
a
society.
it
does
not
adjudicate
what,
in
equity
or
in
private
antitrust
right,
might
be
the
maximum,
the
minimum
or
the
different
antitrust
or
equity
result
that
any
one
member,
suing
in
his
own
right,
could
secure
an
adjudication
of
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
well,
it's
a
metaphysical
entity
inclusive
of
its
members
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
because
a
decree,
your
honor,
is
addressed
to
removing
without
reference
to
rights
of
the
members
of
the
society
inter
sese
to
just
or
even
antitrust
correct
distributions
of
voting
rights
and
money,
and
is
directed
only
to
removing
with
respect
to
the
society
as
a
whole,
its
restraints
as
a
whole
and
not
inter
sese,
except
as
the
decree
specifically
passes
on
that
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
no,
he's
--
certainly,
your
honor,
he
is
affected
by
the
decree
but
as
in
the
sutphen
case,
and
that
very
point
is
there,
many
people
are
affected
by
adjudications
of
the
public
right
which
bind
the
action
of
a
corporation-defendant
or
a
societal-defendant.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
the
person
with
a
specific
right
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
--
inherent
in
him
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
no,
i
think
i'm
not,
your
honor.
i
think
i'm
cutting
it
as
broadly
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
--
as
it
must
be
because,
your
honor,
his
right
could
not
be
barred
in
any
way
by
consent
action
between
the
member
and
the
united
states,
though
approved
by
a
court
because
if
that
were
true,
then
every
member's
right
would
similarly
be
struck
down.
and
the
right
that
he
is
pressing
is
a
right
particular
to
him
though,
with
respect
to
the
society,
because
it
is
his
individual
right
to
a
different
distribution
and
a
different
voting
right
that
he
presses
upon
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
he
would
disturb
every
other
voting
right
and
every
other
distributive
right
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
because
it's
a
right
to
disturb,
as
in
hansberry
against
lee.
this
is
a
class
made
up
of
as
many
members
as
there
is
--
as
there
are
members
of
the
society
in
the
perspective
of
appellants'
analysis
of
the
situation
in
which
they
are
essentially
pressing,
not
a
right
of
but
against
the
society
and
its
remaining
membership.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
now,
he
would
prevail
in
a
suit
against
ascap
in
which
he
would
sue
on
behalf
of
himself
and
all
others,
if
any,
similarly
situated
and
issue
would
be
“is
he
a
true
member
of
a
class?”
he
would
fail
in
that
demonstration
because
the
right
of
every
class
member,
in
the
prospective
of
his
claim,
is
individual,
different
and
not
a
class
right.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
but
that
is
not
the
issue.
he
certainly
is
affected
by
the
decree
so
long
as
it
remains
undisturbed
by
some
later
judicial,
legislative
or
other
governmental
action
by
which
he
effects
a
disturbance
of
that
relation.
there
is
no
adjudication
in
this
decree
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
--
with
respect
to
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
i
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
--
that
you
have
--
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
--
the
power
to
beg
question
successfully
and
i
have
not.
mr.
john
f.
dooling,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.

this
decree
could
not
even
be
offered
in
evidence
in
such
an
action
against
ascap,

under
section
5
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
john

that
is

of
their
equitable
right
to
a

and
fair
distribution

of
their
antitrust
right,
which
has
not

adjudicated
and

this
decree

be
vigilant
to
pounce
by
intervention
into
this
proceeding
so
as
to
protect
their
interest
of
equity
and
of
antitrust
in
distribution
and
voting.

i
would
think
of
him
as

dispose
of
the
claim.
