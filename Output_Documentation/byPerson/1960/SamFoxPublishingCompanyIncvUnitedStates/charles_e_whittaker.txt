justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
horsky?
if
you
had
been
an
intervenor
at
that
time,
then
would
not
your
assent
have
been
necessary
to
a
consent
revision
of
the
judgment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
then
to
permit
intervention
in
the
government
suit
by
third
parties,
would
--
if
that
third
party
were
dissident
prevent
the
attorney
general
from
arriving
at
a
consent
judgment,
wouldn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
friedman,
is
it
quite
correct
to
say
that
the
sole
claim
is
that
you
didn't
adequately
represent
the
public
interest
that
mr.
horsky
contend
you
didn't
represent
his
interest?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
didn't
seek,
as
i
understand
it,
to
intervene
for
the
privilege
of
better
representing
the
public.
he
sought
to
intervene
for
the
privilege
of
advancing
his
own
interest.
