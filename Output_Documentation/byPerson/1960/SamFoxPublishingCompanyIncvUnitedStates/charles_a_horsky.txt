mr.
charles
a.
horsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
decision
by
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
denying
the
appellants'
motion
to
intervene
in
a
proceeding
pending
before
that
court.
at
the
last
term,
this
court
postponed
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction
to
this
hearing
on
the
merits,
and
i
will
perforce
discuss
the
question
of
jurisdiction
at
the
outset.
i
trust,
however,
the
court
will
grant
me
a
few
minutes
to
set
the
question
of
jurisdiction
in
its
perspective
by
a
recitation
of
the
facts
upon
which
this
case
arises
in
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
and
of
the
motion
that
was
made.
the
proceeding
in
which
intervention
was
sought
was
an
antitrust
action
brought
against
the
american
society
of
composers,
authors
and
publishers,
its
officers
and
directors
and
its
members.
ascap,
which
is
the
common
shorthand
for
that
long
name,
is
a
--
an
unincorporated
association
composed
of
music
writers,
lyric
writers
and
music
publishers
who
assigned
to
it
licenses
for
the
public
performance
of
their
works
and
who
received
from
it,
a
distribution
of
the
license
fees
which
it
collects.
the
appellants,
i
should
add,
are
three
publisher
members
of
ascap.
the
antitrust
action
against
ascap
was
commenced
about
20
years
ago
in
february
1941.
the
complaint
in
the
case
alleged
two
areas
in
which
the
actions
of
the
society
and
its
members
were
alleged
to
contravene
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
one
of
the
areas
concern
the
relationships
between
the
society
and
its
membership
with
its
licensees
or
prospective
licensees.
that
area
is
not
involved
in
this
proceeding.
i
think
all
parties
are
agreed
that
we
can
put
that
aspect
of
the
antitrust
case
to
one
side.
the
other
area
which
was
alleged
in
the
original
complaint
concerned
the
relationships,
the
competitive
relationships
arising
as
between
the
members
of
ascap
and
among
the
members
of
ascap
itself.
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
directors
had
the
power
to
control
the
operations
of
the
society.
the
articles
of
association
of
the
society
gave
this
self-perpetuating
board
of
directors,
the
power
to
determine,
in
effect,
the
competitive
standings
and
relationships
among
the
members
by
virtue
of
its
practically
unlimited
power
to
determine
how
the
fees
of
the
society
should
be
distributed
to
the
man.
about
a
week
after
the
complaint
was
filed
in
1941,
a
consent
decree
was
entered.
in
respect
of
the
matters
with
which
we
are
concerned
here,
it
did
two
things.
it
first
provided
that
the
directors
should
be
elected
by
the
membership
of
the
society.
it
also
laid
down
certain
general
standards
which
were
to
govern
the
manner
in
which
the
distributions
of
the
license
fees
were
to
be
made
to
the
society's
membership.
these
generalized
admonitions
in
the
1941
decree
against
the
actions
of
the
dominating
board
of
directors
soon
to
prove
to
be
quite
inadequate.
and
in
1950,
on
the
motion
of
the
department
of
justice,
but
again
by
consent,
a
second
decree
was
entered
in
the
suit,
known
as
the
1950
decree.
this
decree
made
somewhat
more
specific,
the
basis
upon
which
the
revenues
of
the
society
where
it
would
be
distributed.
it
recited
that
it
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
action
to
ensure
a
democratic
administration
of
the
society,
and
it
therefore
required
certain
somewhat
more
detailed
requirements
in
the
articles
of
association
regarding
the
manner
in
which
the
directors
where
to
be
elected.
within
a
few
years,
the
continuing
course
of
complaints
from
the
general
membership
of
the
society
caused
the
department
of
justice
again
to
look
into
the
operations
of
the
society
and
the
manner
in
which
the
directors
had
succeeded
in
continuing
their
position
of
domination
over
it.
the
investigation
began
in
1956
and
by
1958,
the
department
of
justice
had
concluded
that
notwithstanding
two
consent
decrees,
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
action
had
not
been
achieved.
indeed,
the
plaintiff,
the
smaller
publisher
members
of
the
society,
was
such
that
the
small
business
committee
of
the
house
of
representatives
also
conducted
an
investigation
of
the
society.
the
700
odd
page
record
of
those
hearings
and
the
committee
reports
are
referred
to
in
our
brief.
the
1950
decree,
the
1950
consent
decree,
in
addition
to
the
usual
retention
of
jurisdiction
provisions,
common
in
antitrust
consent
decrees,
expressly
reserved
to
the
department
of
justice
the
right
at
any
time
after
1955
to
move
in
the
district
court
in
new
york
for
a
modification
of
the
1950
decree
in
any
respect.
by
1958,
the
information
which
the
department
had
itself
get,
as
its
counsel
told
the
court
and
the
information
which
had
been
unearthed
by
the
congressional
investigation
had
brought
the
department
to
the
conclusion
that
it
should
move
for
further
modifications.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
to
further
give
you
an
--
an
understanding
what
follows
if
i
quote
one
short
paragraph
of
the
report
made
by
the
department
of
justice
to
the
district
court
at
the
time
that
the
proposed
amendments
which,
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment,
were
represented
to
it.
this
is
the
situation
as
of
1959.
i
am
reading
from
page
140
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
"ascap's
board
of
directors,
as
here
and
before
stated,
has
established
a
distribution
system
which
has
the
effect
of
favoring
certain
members
at
the
expense
of
others,
and
at
the
same
time,
ascap
has
waited
the
votes
of
its
members
so
as
to
provide
that
those
members
who
received
the
greatest
share
of
its
revenues
shall
also
have
the
largest
number
of
votes."
the
vice
of
the
system
is
that
it
gives
those
members
in
ascap
who
received
the
largest
share
of
ascap's
revenues,
the
power
to
elect
the
directors
of
the
society
who
in
turn
have
the
power
to
establish
the
rules
governing
the
society's
system
of
distribution
which
in
turn
determines
which
member
shall
receive
the
largest
share
of
the
society's
income.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
sir.
this
is
a
memorandum
submitted
by
the
department
of
justice
to
the
district
court
at
the
time
that
the
proposed
modifications
were
submitted
for
its
approval.
the
circumstances,
i
will
come
to
in,
if
i
may,
in
a
moment.
you
will
also
notice
on
that
same
page
140
that
--
that
same
report
advised
the
court
that
at
the
--
under
this
1950
decree
which
sought
to
democratize
the
affairs
of
the
society,
the
directors
had
succeeded
in
providing
a
system
under
which
99%
of
the
total
publisher
membership
of
the
society
did
not
have
the
combine
power
to
elect
a
single
director,
and
this
after
two
consent
decrees.
now,
instead
of
pursuing
its
original
--
instead
of
pursuing
its
original
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i'm
sorry
sir.
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
the
board
of
directors
is,
really,
two
boards,
12
members
elected
by
the
publishers
and
12
members
elected
by
the
writers.
the
--
the
report
points
out
95%
of
the
writers
could
not
elect
a
writer
director,
99%
of
the
publishers
could
not
elect
a
publisher
director.
now,
instead
of
pursuing
its
original
intention
to
move
in
the
district
court
for
a
modification
of
the
consent
decree,
the
department
in
1958
acceded
to
a
request
that
it
enter
into
negotiations
with
the
society,
so
its
board
of
directors
and
counsel
selected
by
term
for
still
another
consent
decree.
by
mid-1959,
approximately
june
1959,
the
department
had
reached
what
its
counsel
told
the
lower
court
was
a
compromise.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
june
1959.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
memorandum
was
submitted
in
october
with
the
--
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
to
which
i'm
about
to
come.
the
--
the
compromise
which
the
department
agreed
was
also
--
it
also
advised
the
district
court
was
the
farthest
limit
to
which
it
believed
that
ascap
could
be
persuaded
to
go
by
negotiation.
this
compromise
arrangement
was
embodied
in
proposed
amendments
to
the
1950
consent
decree
and
was
presented
to
the
court
in
june.
at
that
time,
the
court
issued
a
rule
ordering
the
parties
to
show
cause
why
it
should
approve
the
proposed
amendments.
now,
on
the
return
day,
which
was
in
october
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
rule
was
issued
to
the
parties
but
it
also
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
litigating
parties
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
but
it
also
--
it
also
provided
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
it
also
provided
that
wide
publicity
should
be
given
to
the
--
proposals
copy
should
be
mailed
to
all
of
the
members,
and
it
further
provided
that
anyone
who
wish
to
appear
and
show
cause
why
the
--
why
the
proposals
did
not
carry
out
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
suit
should
come
in
on
october,
i
think
it
was
29
in
any
event.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
that
was
open,
your
honor.
we
were
advised
that
it
was
opened
so
that
in
order
to
be
sure
of
our
position
before
the
return
day,
we
filed
on
behalf
of
the
appellants
a
motion
to
intervene
under
rule
24
(a)
(2).
in
order
to
present
proof
that
the
proposals
would
not
carry
out
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
suit
and
to
urge
changes
in
them
which
we
believe
were
necessary
to
protect
the
smaller
publisher
members
of
the
society
against
the
domination
of
the
large
publishing
group
which
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
suit
to
occur
in
accordance
with
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
the
--
the
--
in
june,
sir,
the
court
was
handed
the
proposed
amended
consent
decree
which
was
amendments
to
the
1950
decree,
and
he
directed
and
there
was
in
fact
distributed
to
appellants
as
well
as
to
all
other
members
of
the
society.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
actual
terms
of
the
proposal.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
now,
in
accordance
with
rule
24
(a)
(2),
appellants
alleged
and
offered
to
prove
that
they
were
not
adequately
represented
either
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
society
or
by
the
department
of
justice,
and
that
they
would
in
fact
be
bound
as
members
of
the
society
by
the
decree
if
the
court
were
to
enter
it.
the
claims
that
appellant
made
were
embodied
in
a
pleading
pursuant
to
rule
24
(c),
and
they
were
supported
by
two
memorandums.
now,
on
the
return
day
in
october
1959,
without
argument,
without
findings
and
without
opinion,
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
intervene.
its
later
formal
order
to
that
effect
entered
a
couple
of
weeks
afterwards,
recites
basically
three
grounds
for
its
action.
first,
that
appellants
were
represented
by
the
directors
of
the
society
because
they
were
members
of
the
society,
and
they
had
consented
theretofore
be
represented
by
the
directors.
second,
that
it
was
--
they
were
represented
by
the
department
of
justice
and
third,
a
reason
that
i
am
not
wholly
clear
about
with
the
languages
that
appellants
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
this
is
page
489,
mr.
justice.
that
appellants
have
permitted
this
cause
to
proceed
to
judgment
--
prevent
this
cause
in
which
they
are
not
named
as
parties
to
proceed
the
judgment.
now,
this
is
the
order
from
which
this
appeal
has
taken.
before
dealing
with
either
the
substance
of
this
1960
proposal
or
what
subsequently
transpired
in
the
district
court,
let
me
take
a
moment
to
discuss
the
problem
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
review
this
order.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
we
had
three
decrees,
your
honor,
which
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
was
made
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right,
as
a
proposal.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
no.
one
knew
that
the
government
would
consent.
it
was
presented
to
the
court,
there
--
the
transcripts
of
the
two
earlier
hearings
in
june
are
in
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
record,
but
i
can
summarize
them
for
you.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
--
in
--
in
june
1959,
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
that
the
counsel
for
the
department
of
justice
and
counsel
representing
ascap
approached
the
district
court
in
new
york
with
a
proposal
or
an
amendment
to
the
1950
decree
which
they
said
had
been
consented
to
by
both
parties.
the
district
court
said,
at
that
time,
"well,
we
ought
to
give
this
wide
publicity,
and
i
don't
think
that
we
ought
to
have
anything
done
about
it
until
there's
been
a
return
date
which
you
can
show
cause."
after
a
certain
amount
of
--
of
colloquy,
that
was
fixed
to
be
in
october.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
no,
no.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
i
think
it's
actually
the
submission
in
october.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
could
--
it
could
be
earlier
than
june,
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
we
--
we
filed
our
motion
for
leave
sometime
about
10
days
before
the
return
day,
your
honor,
in
october.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right,
that's
right.
there's
no
charge
here
by
anyone
that
we
were
not
timely
in
filing
our
petition.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
that's
--
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
i
can
understand.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
--
that's
right.
that
was
the
formal
entry
of
the
order
which
was
actually
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
it
was
forthwith
denied.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
don't
--
frankly,
i
don't
either,
sir.
now,
let
me
take
to
--
but
a
moment
on
the
matter
of
jurisdiction
because
i
think
it
really
doesn't
worth
more
than
that.
i
maybe
misinterpreting
the
court's
order
but
if
so,
i
will
permit
the
court
to
correct
me.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
surely.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
in
1941.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
there
had
been
at
least
three
attempts
by
people,
not
these
appellants,
to
intervene.
i
can't
be
sure
that
i
can
recite
the
dates
accurately,
but
they
had
all
been
--
been
refute.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
they
had
all
been
denied.
the
last
one
prior
to
this
raised
one
of
the
questions,
which
i
think
is
quite
or
perhaps
worth
a
moment.
an
attempt
was
made
to
intervene
in
1956
by
some
people
who
were
interested
in
the
manner
in
which
they
thought
the
departments
were
--
were
premising
the
directors
to
avoid
and
evade
the
1950
decree.
the
court
at
that
time
said,
"as
far
as
i
can
see,
the
department
has
advised
me
if
it's
investigating,
if
there
is
need
for
action,
it
will
take
it
and
therefore,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
you
need
to
come
in."
that
was
the
--
the
sort
of
a
context
in
which
the
last
petition
to
intervene
was
refused.
now,
a
moment
on
the
jurisdiction.
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
department
of
justice
has
reconsidered
the
position
which
it
took
in
its
motion
to
dismiss
this
appeal
at
the
last
term
and
now
concurs
with
appellants
that
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction,
i
think,
i
can,
perhaps,
abbreviate
what
i
might
otherwise
say.
but
anyway,
let
me
summarize
it.
we
and
the
department
are
now
both
of
the
opinion
that
when
intervention
is
claimed
as
a
right
under
rule
24
(a),
as
distinguished
from
intervention
claimed
permissively
under
rule
24
(b),
the
order
of
the
lower
court
denying
intervention
is
an
appealable
order.s
we
are
further
in
accord
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
the
question
on
the
merits,
in
effect,
colorless,
that
is,
if
the
court
were
to
decide
that
the
order
of
the
lower
court
denying
intervention
was
a
proper
order,
it
would
dismiss
the
appeal
rather
than
affirm
the
judgment.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
were
to
conclude
that
the
order
of
the
lower
court
was
erroneous,
it
would
have
jurisdiction
to
reverse
the
judgment.
an
example
of
the
formal
situation
is
the
sutphen
estates
case
in
342
u.s.
examples
of
the
latter
cases
are
the
brotherhood
of
railway
trainmen
in
the
322
u.s.
and
the
missouri-kansas
pipe
line
company
case
in
the
312
u.s.
in
the
former
case,
the
appeal
was
dismissed
upon
the
conclusion
that
the
intervention
was
properly
denied.
in
the
latter
two
cases,
the
decision
below
was
reversed
upon
the
conclusion
of
this
court
that
intervention
was
improperly
denied.
now,
i
believe
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
this
--
of
the
opinions
of
this
court.and
with
due
difference,
i
will
proceed
to
the
question
on
the
merits.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
under
24
(a)
--
well,
under
24
(b),
i
suppose
there
could
be.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
suppose
it
--
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sure
that
you
could
have
a
situation
in
which
there
would
be
abuse
of
24
(b)
by
refusing
intervention
whether
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
would
make
that
appealable
as
of
--
as
if
it
were
a
24
(a)
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
denial
or
not,
i
--
i
have
frankly
not
look
at
the
decision
with
that
in
mind.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
there
are
some
indications,
but
there
may
be
a
contrary
or
elsewhere
that
i
don't
have
in
mind.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
it
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
and
i
suppose
that
if
you
take
the
rationale
of
the
cases
and
say
that
the
reason
that
you
postponed
the
question
in
the
24
(b)
cases
is
because
you
have
to
have
the
whole
context.
if
it's
so
clear
that
it's
an
abusive
discretion,
it
might
well
be
possible
that
you
would
hear
it
promptly
and
decide
it.
now,
one
--
before
i
come
to
the
merits,
one
--
one
more
preliminary
word.
as
i
said,
the
district
court
decided
the
case
without
making
any
findings
of
fact
on
the
allegations
and
offers
of
proof
made
by
the
appellants
in
our
moving
papers
and
in
our
supporting
memorandum.
as
i
understand
the
question
that
was
before
the
district
court
and
indeed
as
i
understand
the
question
is
--
which
is
before
this
court,
the
issue
is
as
a
matter
of
law,
where
those
allegations
adequate
to
warrant
intervention?
now,
the
first
of
the
requirements
of
the
rule,
obviously,
is
that
the
representation
of
the
applicants'
interest
by
the
existing
parties
is
or
maybe
inadequate.
the
existing
parties
within
the
terms
of
the
rule
were
the
board
of
directors
of
ascap
and
the
department
of
justice,
the
considerations
which
--
which
bear
upon
whether
the
representation
by
either
of
those
parties
was
adequate
or
obviously
different
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
proceed
first
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
directors.
appellant's
basic
position
as
to
the
adequacy
of
representation
by
the
board
of
directors
is
very
simple.
they
alleged
in
their
pleadings
and
offer
to
prove
that
the
society's
board
of
directors
was
dominated
by
the
very
group
of
large
publisher
members
which
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
suit
to
curve
and
bring
under
control.
the
directors
were
the
representatives
of
the
very
group
that
appellants
sought
to
prove
should
be
restrained
much
more
than
the
proposed
decree
proposed
to
be
restraint.
on
the
phase
of
it,
appellants'
interests
and
the
interests
of
the
directors
were
directly
antagonistic.
and
consequently,
we
submitted
that
they
could
not
properly
be
said
to
representatives.
now,
in
this
court,
it
is
argued
by
counsel
for
ascap
that
the
board
of
directors
did
in
fact
represent
the
appellants
because
in
a
membership
vote
taken
under
the
direction
of
the
district
court
following
the
proceedings
in
the
court,
a
majority
of
the
members
of
the
society
ratified
or
voted
yes
on
the
proposals
to
amend
the
decree.
let
me
give
you
a
word
of
background
before
i
approach
that
argument.
following
the
hearing
--
i
should
say
that
at
the
return
date,
there
was
a
hearing.
the
district
judge
himself
said
he'd
like
to
have
it
--
he
like
a
town
meeting
with
himself
as
the
town
boss.
but
there
was
a
hearing.
and
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing,
the
court
ordered
that
a
--
ballots
be
submitted
to
each
member
of
ascap,
publisher
as
well
as
writer,
on
which
he
could
mark
either
yes
or
no
to
the
question,
"do
you
approve
the
proposed
amendments?"
each
member
was
entitled
to
one
vote
on
this
ballot,
although
there
was
a
weighted
ballot
also
taken
at
the
same
time
to
comply
with
the
society's
articles
of
association.
in
this
non-weighted
vote,
a
majority
of
the
writers
and
the
majority
of
the
publishers
voted
to
accept
the
proposals.
there
was,
however,
a
very
substantial
minority
vote.
40%
of
the
voting
publishers
voted
no,
30%
of
the
voting
writers
voted
no,
indeed
of
the
eligible
publishers
only
47%
voted
yes.
now,
i
should
like
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
there
--
there
were
about,
at
the
time,
1300
publisher
members
and
about
3200
writer
members.
and
i
think
the
proportion
of
voting
was
around
75%
to
80%,
your
honor.
i
will
ask
my
associate
to
check
and
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
give
me
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
there
are
1000
publisher
voters
in
any
event,
it's
a
good
cross
section.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
let
me
make,
however,
three
observations
on
the
argument
that
this
plebiscite
is
enough
to
demonstrate
that
the
directors
of
the
society
were
representing
appellants'
interests.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out.
now,
i
think
this
is
very
important
that
the
ballot
--
the
balloting
was
subject
to
the
fatal
deficiency
that
all
of
the
facts
were
not
available
on
which
to
exercise
a
judgment.
because
these
appellants
had
not
permitted
to
intervene,
they
had
been
unable
to
make
a
record
on
which
a
meaningful
vote
would
have
been
really
possible
because
they
were
not
parties,
they
were
unable
to
call
witnesses,
they
were
unable
to
attend
their
documentary
evidence,
and
even
more
important,
they
were
unable
to
lay
before
the
court
evidence
which
has
parties.
they
could
have
elicited
from
the
society
and
from
others
by
means
of
discovery
and
interrogations.
they
were
not
able
to
present
the
evidence
which
would
have
shown
the
value
and
the
practicability
of
the
alternatives
which
they
were
espousing.
well,
it
certainly
is
unusual,
to
say
at
least,
to
have
a
plebiscite
on
whether
proposals
to
curve
antitrust
violators
are
adequate
or
inadequate
particularly
a
proposal
in
which
the
violators
and
the
victims
both
participated.
now,
we
think
it
would
really
be
a
monstrous
doctrine
to
say
that
it
should
be
given
the
conclusive
effect
that
counsel
here
suggests
for
it,
unless
the
people
who
were
voting
had
the
opportunity
to
know
all
the
facts
about
all
the
issues.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
it's
the
other
way
around,
sir.
it
is
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
they
will
ask
to
vote
on
the
decree.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
correct.
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
quite
true.
and
i
suppose
that
it
can
be
said
that
there
is
no
necessary
correlation
between
whether
you
want
these
proposals
and
whether
your
interests
were
adequately
represented
at
all.
i
think
that
is
a
valid
comment
which
should
--
could
be
made
on.
my
point
here
is
though
that
even
accepting
that
premise,
the
basis
upon
which
the
voting
was
taken
was
inadequate
basis
to
really
record
a
definitive
expression
of
the
membership.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
that
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
they
did
not
have
because
we
have
not
been
able
to
have
the
opportunity
to
present
that
to
the
court.
now,
the
other
aspect
of
this
which
i
think
is
important
is
that
the
voting
was
on
a
take
it
or
leave
it
basis.
appellants'
papers,
petition
for
intervention
did
not
suggest
that
all
provisions
of
the
proposed
amendments
were
bad.
there
were
provisions
in
the
proposals
which
might
well
have
commended
themselves
to
members
as
a
distinct
improvement.
no
one
can
know.
in
other
words,
how
many
members
voted
yes
on
the
premise
that
even
a
little
bit
of
improvement
is
better
than
conditions
which
have
become
empowered.
moreover,
there
is
one
other
aspect
of
this
take
it
or
leave
it
which
i
think
is
important.
due
to
what
i
am
quite
sure
was
a
misapprehension
by
the
district
court
of
his
powers
under
the
1950
decree,
the
district
judge
stated
during
the
hearing
on
several
occasions
that
the
alternatives
to
an
approval
of
these
proposals
was
a
litigation
of
the
1941
complaint
which
would
put
the
entire
society
in
jeopardy
of
it's
dissolution.
needless
to
say,
the
directors
and
officers
of
the
society
in
campaigning
for
an
affirmative
vote
in
favor
of
their
proposals
made
good
use
of
the
judges'
remarks.
my
third
comment
on
this
plebiscite
is
that
there
was
in
fact
a
very
substantial
minority
vote.
the
appellants,
the
proposed
intervenors
don't
stand
before
you
as
three
descendants
in
a
society
of
5000
people.
there
were
a
very
substantial
number,
presumably
those
who
had
no
part
in
the
negotiation
of
this
decree
who
would
rather
have
suffered
on
under
the
conditions
existing,
and
they
were
taken
this
judgment.
now,
let
me
turn
to
the
other
half
of
this
first
requirement
of
the
rule,
the
representation
by
the
department
of
justice.
obviously
here,
the
factors
are
quite
different.
i
think
i
can
dispose
some
of
them
rather
quickly.
there
is
no
dispute,
of
course,
here
that
the
department
of
justice
by
law
and
by
tradition
represents
the
interests
--
the
public
interests
in
united
states
litigation
whether
it
be
antitrust
or
anything
else.
the
dispute
on
that
issue
rather
is
with
the
conclusion
which
the
appellees
seek
to
draw
from
it,
and
that
is
that
rule
24
(a)
(2)
simply
has
no
application
in
government
litigation.
i
think
that
that
is
a
misinterpretation
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
of
the
lower
courts,
and
i
think
the
true
issue
here
is
when
such
intervention
is
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
prior
to
the
formulation
of
the
proposals?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
prior,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
department
of
justice
was
receptive
to
suggestions
from
the
membership.
and
i
believe
that
my
particular
clients
in
fact
submitted
suggestions
to
the
department
with
respect
to
what
should
be
in
the
decree.
between
june
and
october,
i
am
quite
confident
that
they
did
not.
at
that
time,
the
matter
appeared
to
be
frozen.
now,
the
second
question
which
is
not
involved
in
this
litigation
is
the
matter
of
intervention
by
what
i
would
like
to
sort
of
lump
together
as
strangers
to
an
antitrust
case
if
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
customer
or
a
licensee
or
a
competitor
of
an
antitrust
defendant
is
attempting
to
intervene.
the
simple
answer
to
most
of
those
people
is
that
they
can't
meet
the
formal
requirement
--
the
less
formal
requirement
of
rule
24
(a)
(2)
that
they
both
will
or
maybe
bound
by
the
provisions
of
the
judgment.
the
present
case
is
really
an
unusual
situation.
not
only
as
intervention
sought
by
representatives
of
a
quite
small
and
definite
group
who
are
the
victims
of
the
sherman
act
conspiracy
which
is
sought
to
be
curved.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
it's
a
small
group
of
dominant
publishers
alleged
to
dominate
the
society's
directors.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i'm
sorry.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
group
that
is
affected
--
well
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
large
or
small,
i'm
talking
of
numbers.
it
may
be
as
many
as
1200
publishers.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
purpose
of
the
enterprise,
it
is
the
vast
majority,
that's
right,
perhaps
99%.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
as
members,
moreover,
they
are
bound
by
the
judgment
when
it
is
entered
and
approved
by
the
court.
now,
that's
what's
involved
here.
there
--
also,
another
thing
that's
involved
here.
there
wasn't
any
doubt
in
this
case
as
to
what
the
department
of
justice
might
do.
here,
we
had
presented
to
the
court
what
the
department
of
justice
had
proposed
to
do,
and
the
issue
was
the
adequacy
of
the
proposals
which
had
been
formulated
and
presented
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
and
i
proposed
to
come
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
we
did
do
that,
sir.
now,
what
we
sought
to
do
by
its
reading
was
to
persuade
the
court
that
it
did
not
--
that
it
should
not
approve
this
proposed
amended
consent
decree
because
it
would
still
leave
the
appellants
and
the
other
members
of
ascap,
the
general
membership
of
ascap
without
protection
from
the
conspiracy
alleged.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
would
not
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
suit.
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
to
a
consent
revision,
surely.
if
we
had
been
parties,
i
suppose
it
requires
the
consent
of
all
parties.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
it
would
--
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
that
if
you
--
if
you
would
start
with
the
assumption,
which
we
are
now
starting
with,
that
these
people
are
bound
by
the
provisions
of
the
judgment.
that
is
--
its
res
judicata
as
to
them,
and
if
they
come
in
and
say,
"it
isn't
a
fair
judgment,
your
honor,
for
us
that
there
isn't
any
reason
in
the
world
why
the
court
should
say
just
because
the
attorney
general
has
reached
an
agreement
with
somebody
else
that
you
can't
tell
me
why
you
think
i
shouldn't
enter
this
judgment
against
you."
that's
what
this
comes
down
to.
it
certainly
would
prevent
the
--
if
we
were
permitted
to
intervene,
it
would
prevent
the
entry
of
a
consent
judgment
because
the
parties
would
not
have
consented
to
it.
it
seems
to
me,
however,
perfectly
fair
and
perfectly
probable
that
that
be
the
result
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
as
i
said
before,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we're
not
talking
about
a
stranger
to
the
litigation.
we're
talking
about
a
person
who
can
meet
all
three
of
the
requirements
of
rule
24
(a)
(2)
including
most
importantly
that
he
would
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
government's
position
on
that,
your
honor,
is
--
well,
yes
and
no.
the
government
says
this
was
a
class
suit.
and
as
i
read
their
brief
they
also
say
that
in
a
class
suit
under
the
ben
hur
case
and
others,
if
it
is
a
class
suit,
the
members
of
the
class
are
bound.
what
they
say,
however,
is
that
in
this
particular
judgment,
the
judgment
sets
only
minimum
standards
for
the
conduct
of
the
dominant
group
in
the
society
and
therefore
that
we,
as
members,
could
institute
a
separate
action
and
insist
upon
a
higher
standard
being
applied
than
is
required
by
this
judgment.
our
answer
to
that,
if
i
may
interpose
this
for
the
moment,
our
answer
to
that
is
that
they
are
simply
wrong
on
the
facts.
i
can't
give
you
the
illustrations
now
because
it
requires
a
little
more
background
to
make
it,
but
there
are
provisions
in
this
judgment
which
you
will
see
upon
it's
--
examining
it
which
do
set
precisely
what
ascap
must
do,
not
what
it
may
do
and
certainly
what
it
must
do
if
he
elects
one
course
of
conduct
or
another.
and
therefore,
we
say
that
we
are
bound.
and
the
argument
between
us
and
the
government
on
that
issue
revolves
around
an
interpretation,
really,
of
whether
the
--
whether
the
judgment
is
a
set
of
minimum
standards
or
whether
it
is
a
set
of
absolute
standard.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
believe
a
reading
of
it
will
demonstrate
that
we
are
substantially
accurate
in
many
respects.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
well,
the
--
the
department
of
justice,
to
come
back
to
the
--
the
point
that
i
was
on
with
justice
--
mr.
justice
whittaker,
takes
the
position
in
the
brief
--
in
its
briefs
here,
and
i
don't
think
i
paraphrased
this
unfairly,
that
when
that
it
is
no
business
of
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
a
consent
decree
adequately
carries
out
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
or
not.
the
department
says
that's
its
business,
and
it
is
no
concern
of
the
district
court,
and
it
is
not
proper
for
the
district
court
to
intervene
in
those
determinations.
therefore,
it
says,
"there
is
no
warrant
for
intervention.
there
is
no
need
to
have
further
facts
because
there's
nothing
for
the
court
to
decide."
now,
i
suggest
that
that
is
a
rather
startling
contention.
i
also
suggest
that
it
is
pretty
clearly
contrary
to
what
this
court
said
not
more
than
a
couple
of
months
ago
in
system
federation
against
wright,
system
federation
number
91
against
wright
where
the
court
had
occasion
to
examine
the
question
of
the
duty
of
the
district
court
on
consent
decrees
and
specifically
on
modification
of
consent
decrees.
for
present
purposes,
the
significant
part
of
that
decision
is
that
in
which
this
court
made
it
clear
that
the
authority
of
the
district
courts
to
approve
a
consent
decree
comes
not
at
all
from
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
it
may
infrequently
does
approve
the
decrees
but
the
authority
comes
from
it
and
the
responsibility
is
measured
by
the
statute
which
the
decree
is
entitled
--
is
intended
to
enforce.
now,
that
to
me
means
that
the
district
court
does
have
a
responsibility
which
it
was
obliged
to
discharge
in
this
case.
that
responsibility,
moreover,
was
measured
by
the
antitrust
laws,
not
by
the
agreement
reached
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
directors
of
the
society.
and
in
this
case,
the
allegations
of
the
appellants
showed
that
the
proposed
decree
felt
so
far
short
of
adequate
relief
that
it
demonstrated
that
the
department
of
justice
did
not
adequately
represented
the
interests
of
these
appellants.
now,
in
our
pleadings
and
in
our
supporting
memorandum
in
the
district
court,
we
specified
the
--
the
matters
in
which
the
decree
in
our
judgment
were
inadequate
to
accomplish
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
suit.
in
our
brief
in
this
court,
we
have
discussed
two
of
those
matters
at
some
length.
they
aren't
unfortunately
simple,
and
they
are
very
difficult
to
summarize.
but
let
me
illustrate,
and
i
think
this
will
be
a
fair
illustration
with
the
voting
provisions,
section
4
of
the
proposed
order,
which
is
at
674
of
the
record,
deals
with
the
voting
right.
the
court
will
recall
that
i've
stated
earlier
that
under
the
1950
decree,
the
directors
had
established
a
system
of
weighted
voting
under
which
the
publisher
that
received
the
most
money
got
the
most
votes,
and
the
more
money
he
could
get
for
himself,
the
more
he
would
be
able
to
vote.
the
more
the
society's
revenues
at
these
largest
publishers
were
able
to
choral,
the
better
they
could
solidify
their
control
of
the
society.
and
at
the
time
of
the
modifications
proposed
in
1959,
the
dominant
publisher
group,
the
group
whose
activities
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
suit
occur,
had
achieved
for
themselves
about
63%
of
the
weighted
publisher
vote.
less
than
1%
of
the
entire
publisher
membership
of
the
society
elected
all
the
directors.
and
as
the
department
of
justice
itself
said,
this
frustrated
one
of
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
suit,
the
purpose
to
prevent
the
dominant
publishers
from
using
the
society
to
obtain
an
unfair
competitive
advantage
over
their
other
members.
now,
faced
with
this
situation
of
admitted
control
and
this
situation
of
admitted
frustration
of
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
suit,
what
does
the
proposed
modification
do?
by
a
series
of
provisions
that
permits
this
group,
a
dominant
publisher
group,
to
maintain
37%
of
the
total
publisher
weighted
vote,
calculated
on
the
basis
of
the
figures
then
available
as
supplied
by
the
directors
of
ascap,
it
permits
in
another
provision
that
percentage
to
go
up
by
10%
to
41%
if
the
publishers
properly
adjust
the
affairs
of
their
affiliates
or
if
they
can
choral
that
much
more
of
the
society's
revenues.
it
ignores
the
fact
which
the
appellants
offered
to
prove
in
their
papers
that
affiliated
or
allied
with
this
dominant
publisher
group
are
the
two
largest
publishers
of
series
of
music
which
adds
a
couple
of
additional
percentage
points
to
the
total
percentage
of
the
weighted
vote
which
the
dominant
group
is
able
to
muster.
and
it
further
ignores
the
fact,
as
we
also
offered
to
prove,
that
you
never
get
100%
voting
by
the
publishers.
indeed,
we
had
concluded
in
our
offers
of
proof
that
the
decree
would
actually
give
the
dominant
group
approximately
would
leave
the
dominant
group
which
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
suit
to
--
to
occur
approximately
half
of
the
usual
publisher
vote.
and
it
doesn't
require
very
much
argument
to
demonstrate
that
even
if
they
had
only
41%
or
even
only
37%
with
the
other
votes
widely
scattered
among
1300
small
publishers,
their
control
was
not
very
seriously
affected
by
the
proposed
decree.
in
summary,
the
department
of
justice
urged
the
district
court
to
accept
the
proposal
which
is
no
more
significant
in
practical
effect
than
if
they
urged
that
the
percentage
of
the
vote
be
reduced
from
63%
to
53%.
and
i
submit
that
when
the
department
clearly
leaves
the
appellants
and
the
ascap's
general
membership
at
the
mercy
of
the
dominant
group,
as
they
do
by
this
proposal,
then
the
department
is
not
adequately
representing
the
appellants'
interests.
now,
the
department
says,
"perhaps,
this
isn't
very
important
because
other
provisions
of
the
proposed
decree
prevent
the
directors
from
really
doing
much."
we
really
pretty
well
curved
their
power
even
though
they
still
may
be
in
control.
i
suggest
that
the
--
that
the
figure
with
which
the
dominant
group
has
fought
for
the
control
which
it
has
suggest
that
there
is
more
to
the
matter
of
controlling
the
affairs
of
ascap
and
perhaps
the
department
is
willing
to
acknowledge.
but
let
me
illustrate
by
one
other
area
of
the
decree,
a
portion
of
the
decree
which
illustrates
what
the
directors
can
do.
this
is
the
area
called
the
survey
of
performance.
under
the
1950
judgment,
the
directors
are
required
to
make
a
survey
of
performances
and
based
the
distribution
of
the
--
of
the
revenues
on
that
survey.
this
information
--
the
survey
consists
of
two
steps.
first,
the
collection
of
the
information
as
to
what
is
performed
and
then
the
application
to
a
certain
mathematical
formula
and
--
to
come
out
to
a
proper
result.
the
memorandum
submitted
by
the
department
of
justice
to
the
court
below
was
properly
very
critical
of
the
manner
in
which
this
survey
had
been
conducted.
the
proposed
order,
however,
does
know
more
or
little
more
than
adjust
the
mathematical
formula
and
the
--
the
calculations
in
order
to
bring
the
more
in
line
with
current
random
sampling
field.
it
doesn't
do
anything
to
curve
the
judgment
and
the
power
of
the
dominant
group
who
control
the
board
of
directors
to
affect
the
information
as
to
performances
which
are
fed
in
to
these
mathematical
surveys.
let
me
give
you
a
--
a
quick
illustration.
the
survey
contemplates
that
a
team
will
go
out
and
take
a
tape
recording
of
two
hours
of
music
on
a
local
radio
station.
this
tape
was
then
mailed
to
new
york
where
the
ascap
staff
tries
to
figure
out
from
all
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pieces
of
music
that
there
are,
who
wrote
and
who
published,
not
just
the
themes
that
are
in
there,
but
the
background
music,
the
theme
music,
the
bridge
music
and
cue
music
and
all
the
other
kinds
of
music
that
are
involved
in
those
two
hours.
there
are
innumerable
questions
of
judgment
that
are
involved
in
determining
what
kind
of
music
it
was,
how
it
was
used
and
how
long
it
was
played
and
the
like.
all
these
questions
are
left
to
a
staff
responsible
to
the
board
of
directors.
and
this
proposed
decree
does
nothing
to
curve
the
power
of
the
board
to
control
the
activities
and
to
affect
the
judgments
of
these
people.
we
proposed
to
show
that
the
only
way
you
could
avoid
this
obvious
conflict
of
interest
situation
which
now
exists
is
to
have
this
survey
made
by
an
outside
organization,
and
we
offer
to
prove
that
it
could
be
probably
be
done
for
less
than
ascap
itself
was
paying
to
do
it.
now,
i
think
my
time
is
rushing.
i
hope
that
i
have
touched
enough
on
the
third
part
of
the
rule,
the
requirement
that
we
must
be
bound.
i
believe
it
is
fair
to
say,
in
a
very
quick
summary,
that
this
is
a
class
suit
that
in
a
class
suit,
res
judicata
applies
to
the
members
of
the
class
and
that
an
examination
of
this
judgment
will
reveal
to
you
that
there
are
many
aspects
of
it
where
it
is
not
permissive,
where
it
is
mandatory
that
ascap
performed
in
this
fashion.
and
as
to
those
places,
it
is,
i
think
without
question,
binding
upon
us,
as
appellants,
unable
to
be
relitigated
in
any
other
suit
and
consequently
sufficient
to
comply
with
the
rule.
i
would
prefer
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
may,
sir.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
may
it
please
the
court.
the
course
of
the
argument
yesterday
leads
me
to
seek
the
indulgence
of
the
court
on
about
three
small
points.
first,
the
court
will
recall
that
in
illustrating
our
contention,
that
the
department
of
justice
inadequately
represented
the
interests
of
these
appellants
in
presenting
to
the
district
court
of
the
decree
which
it
proposed.
i
illustrated
by
assertion
that
the
proposed
decree
left
the
voting
control
of
the
society
precisely
where
it
was
before.
i
hope
that
the
court
will
also
have
observed
that
neither
mr.
dooling
nor
mr.
friedman
took
issue
with
that
assertion.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
there
is
at
least
a
passive
acceptance
of
the
proposition
that
under
the
proposed
decree,
the
dominant
members
of
this
society,
which
is
--
it
has
been
the
purpose
of
this
antitrust
suit
to
curve
and
which
it
has
been
unsuccessful
in
doing
in
two
antitrust
decrees,
remains
undisturbed
under
the
proposals.
that
antitrust
purpose
of
the
suit
has
not
and
will
not
be
accomplished.
second,
if
i
may
turn
from
what
mr.
dooling
and
mr.
friedman
did
not
say
to
what
they
did
say,
i
would
like
to
elaborate
a
bit
on
one
matter
which
i
think
i
replied
to
mr.
justice
whittaker
about
yesterday
and
that
is
what
would
have
happened
had
we
intervened
in
the
court
below
--
had
we
been
permitted
to
intervene.
as
i
see
it,
the
situation
would
have
been
this.
the
district
court,
under
the
powers
reserved
to
it
in
the
decree,
particularly
in
article
17,
which
gives
it
a
specific
power,
would
have
held
a
hearing
on
the
proposed
modifications
of
the
decree.
the
hearing
would
have
been
precisely
the
kind
that
was
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
the
hughes
case
in
the
342
united
states
and
in
the
liquid
carbonic
case
in
the
350
united
states.
i
find
nothing
in
those
cases
or
indeed,
in
any
other
cases
to
support
the
suggestion
which
mr.
dooling
made
yesterday
that
in
that
hearing,
the
court
would
have
had
to
concern
itself
with
the
question
whether
the
society
or
its
members
had
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
it
wuld
have
been
a
hearing
on
whether
and
the
extent
to
which
further
relief
was
appropriate
and
necessary.
and
let
me
add
that
i
see
no
reason
why,
following
that
hearing,
it
would
have
had
any
effect
upon
the
future
use
of
this
decree
in
any
section
5
application
in
any
later
case.
it
--
modified
or
not
by
the
judge
as
the
hearing
might
have
indicated
to
him.
the
decree
still
would
not
adjudge
that
anyone
had
violated
the
antitrust
laws.
i
also
should
add
that
i
think,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
i
believe,
suggested
yesterday,
i
don't
really
think
that
that
issue
is
particularly
relevant
to
the
issue
before
you
here
on
this
appeal,
but
i
believe
that
would
be
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
now,
in
--
finally,
and
my
third
point,
let
me
say
only
this.
i
feel
really
a
certain
sympathy
with
the
department
of
justice
negotiators
and
counsel.
ascap
is
a
very
complex
organization,
a
very
complex
machine,
and
the
way
in
which
it
can
be
made
to
work
its
will
for
the
people
who
hold
the
reins
of
power
in
ascap
are
by
no
mens
apparent.
indeed,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
where
the
issue
is
the
regulation
of
the
internal
affairs
of
a
complex
society,
it
is
highly
appropriate
that
members
of
the
society
who
know
its
workings
and
who
have
been
in
it
would
be
present
to
help
the
court
with
their
facts
and
their
evidence
to
assist
it
in
determining
whether
the
decree
before
it
did,
in
fact,
adequately
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
one
of
these
appellants,
the
fox
company,
has
been
a
member
of
the
society
for
almost
40
years.
it's
a
charter
member
of
the
serious
music
publishers
in
the
society.
the
other
two
members
of
the
--
of
the
appellants
group
have
been
members
for
approximately
20
years
in
the
society.
those
people
know
its
workings.
they
have
been
in
it,
and
their
information,
their
advice
and
most
important,
their
information
as
to
what
further
evidence
was
available
which
could
be
presented
to
the
court.
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
have
been
inestimable
assistance
to
the
district
court
in
determining
whether
this
decree
did,
in
fact,
properly
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
i
submit
to
you
that
they
should
have
been
welcomed
as
intervenors
rather
than
summarily
rejected.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
sir?
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me,
i
can
--
i
think
i
stated
it
rather
summarily
yesterday.
the
issue
on
that
is
about
as
follows.
this
was
a
suit
brought
against
ascap,
its
officers,
directors
and
members.
the
consent
decree
which
was
entered
--
it
--
it
tracks
the
language
of
rule
23.
it
was
obviously
intended
to
be
and
was
indeed
a
true
class
suit.
the
consent
decree
entered
in
1941
had
specific
prohibition
which
ran
against
the
members
which,
as
a
contemporaneous
interpretation,
perhaps
is
significant
as
to
the
nature
of
the
suit.
as
a
true
class
suit,
we
understand
from
the
ben-hur
line
of
cases
and
other
cases,
that
if
a
class
suit
judgment
is
entered,
it
binds
the
members
of
the
class.
so
far,
i
think
we
and
the
department
of
justice,
at
least,
are
in
accord.
the
department
of
justice
takes
the
position
in
its
brief,
and
we
have
dealt
with
it
in
our
reply
brief
at
some
length,
that,
however,
in
this
case,
notwithstanding
that
the
members
would
be
bound
by
whatever
decree
has
been
entered,
nonetheless,
this
decree
does
not
in
fact
set
absolute
things
that
ascap
must
do
but
only
minimums
that
it
must
comply
with.
and
therefore,
they
say
“we
could
bring
another
vindication
and
insist
upon
a
more
stringent
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
ascap
because
ascap
is
free
to
make
these
internal
adjustments.”
as
i
indicated
to
you
before,
i
think
a
reading
of
the
decree
will
dispel
the
belief
that
that
is
true.
there
are
areas,
it
is
quite
true,
where
ascap
is
in
a
position
to
make
--
to
do
so
much
or
not
to
do
so
much,
but
there
are
other
areas
where
the
--
the
direction
of
the
decree
is
a
mandatory
where
ascap
shall
do
this,
ascap
shall
do
that.
and
it
certainly
is
true,
if
you
will
read
the
decree
that
these
defendants
if
--
as
i
say,
we
are
in
accord
up
to
the
point
through
the
ben-hur
case,
that
these
defendants
would
be
inhibited
by
legitimate
pleas
of
res
judicata
if
they
were
to
try
to
do
in
another
obligation
what
we
are
seeking
to
do
in
this
proposed
amended
decree
that
is
before
you.
i
trust
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
correct.
the
position
we
take,
your
honor,
is
that
the
district
court
had
an
obligation
to
determine
whether
the
proposal
before
it
was
consistent
with
carrying
out
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
suit,
that
is,
its
responsibility
as
to
whether
the
decree
should
be
approved
or
not
approved
was
measured
by
the
statute.
and
in
this
case,
we
say
the
decree
fell
so
far
short
of
--
of
carrying
out
the
purposes
of
the
statute
that
the
court
could
not
properly
approve
it.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
that
was
what
we
propose
to
try
to
prove.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
if
they
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
decree,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
decree
is
--
i
trust
that
you
will
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
oh,
no.
no,
it
goes
much
further
than
that.
it
has
very
elaborate
provisions
on
the
manner
in
which
these
funds
shall
be
distributed
on
the
amount
of
discrimination
which
shall
be
had
between
different
kinds
of
using
--
use
for
the
same
purposes,
etcetera.
it
is
a
very
elaborate
decree.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right
--
that's
right.
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
against
the
other
general
membership
of
ascap
to
the
benefit
of
the
dominant
group
which
we
are
trying
to
prove.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
would
be
res
judicata
in
a
lot
of
cases.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
if
we
are
wrong
on
that,
i
suppose
the
answer
would
be
that
we
could
bring
another
suit.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
we
could
attempt
to
pers
--
persuade
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
the
court
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
as
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
as
i
understand,
sutphen
estates
case
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
as
i
--
i
think
this
requires
a
sentence
or
two,
if
i
may.
as
i
understood
the
language
of
the
court
in
the
sutphen
estates
case,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
believe,
stated
that
unless
the
--
it
was
res
judicata,
you
didn't
comply
with
this
last
requirement
of
rule
24
(a)
(2),
that
is,
that
you
were
not
bound
by
the
decree.
now,
there
are
indications
in
other
cases,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they
may
not
be
proper
indications,
that
you
don't
have
to
go
quite
that
far
in
some
cases
but
you
can
be
bound
in
a
practical
sense
even
though,
perhaps,
you
are
not
strictly
within
the
doctrine
of
res
judicata.
i
think,
here,
we
are
within
the
res
judicata
doctrine
but,
perhaps,
your
honor,
if
we
were
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
if
we
were
not,
it
might
still
be
possible
that
we
could
satisfy
the
court
that
we
were
so
far
practically
bound
that
we
ought
to
be
allowed
to
intervene.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
that
if
we
brought
another
case,
the
effect
of
judge
ryan's
decision
that
this
was
alright
would
be
so
far
conclusive,
as
a
matter
of
comity,
that
we
would
really
never
have
a
chance
to
prove
anything
different.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i'm
not
sure,
mr.
justice
harlan,
whether
it
would
or
not.
there
is
fairly
extensive
authority
for
the
proposition
that
if
suit
brought
against
ascap
under
17
(b)
has
an
unincorporated
association,
a
federal
cause
of
action
being
involved,
is
really
no
different
than
a
23
(a)
suit
anyway,
that
it
binds
the
members.
and
it
would
be
my
belief
that
a
suit
naming
only
ascap
would
have
the
same
res
judicata
consequences
on
the
membership
of
ascap
as
if
it
had
specifically
said
it
was
brought
pursuant
to
23
(a)
or
23
(a)
(1)
or
(a)
(2).
i
don't
believe
it
makes
any
difference
if
they
were
named.
the
fact
is
that
they
were
named
and
the
fact
is
that
the
decree
operated
specifically
against
them
as
members
and
says
“as
members,
you
may
not
do
this
and
this
and
this.”
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
if
i
correctly
understand
your
question,
let
me
be
sure
that
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
think
there
are
two
hearings
that
are
perhaps
intermingled
here
that
we
ought
to
keep
distinct.
i
take
it
that
an
--
a
person
who
applies
to
intervene
must
allege
certain
things.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
if
challenged
or
if
in
doubt,
the
court
may
say
“well,
now,
i'm
going
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
question
as
to
whether
these
facts
he
alleges
as
to
the
basis
for
his
right
to
intervene
are
true
or
not
true."
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
and
if
they
turn
out
to
be
not
true,
then
i
will
deny
the
petition
for
leave
to
intervene.
now
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
or
if
true
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
if
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
if
true,
they
don't
constitute
ground,
he
wouldn't
have
to
have
a
hearing.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
he
would
then
say
as
he
did
here,
as
a
matter
of
law
even
if
you
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
prove
it
all,
you
can't
come
in.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
now,
having
had
that
here,
we
then
come
in,
if
he
says
“alright,
you've
proved
your
facts,
and
i
think
you're
entitled
to
intervene,”
then
there
is
a
hearing
on
the
modification
of
the
decree,
which
is
a
different
hearing.
now,
in
a
sense,
in
this
case,
the
two
are
somewhat
more
interrelated
than
ordinarily,
they
would
be
because
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
if
he
had
taken
evidence
and
our
facts
had
been
disputed
and
the
society
and
the
department
of
justice
had
persuaded
him
that
under
all
the
facts,
even
those
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
which
we
adduced
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
decree
was
a
proper
decree,
that
he
couldn't
have
reached
that
conclusion.
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
certainly
wouldn't
dispute
it.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
all
i
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
all
we
want
is
the
opportunity
to
present
to
him
the
entire
picture
and
leave
it
to
his
judgment
as
to
whether
this
is
a
property.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
thank
you
very
much.
