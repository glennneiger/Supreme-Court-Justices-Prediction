mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
make
it
very
explicit
at
the
outset
that
the
government
is
not
contending,
as
it
has
been
suggested,
that
merely
because
a
consent
judgment
is
entered
into
between
the
government
and
the
defendant
in
an
antitrust
case
that
automatically
that
requires
approval
of
that
decree
and
entry
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
in
this
case
at
the
every
outset
was
quite
explicit
in
stating
several
times
that
judge
ryan
stated
he
would
not
approve
this
decree
unless
he
was
satisfied
that
it
would
carry
out
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
suit.
and
at
the
very
end
of
the
opinion
with
little
--
a
little
opinion
with
judge
ryan
rendered
an
oral
opinion
summarizing
the
decree
and
indicating
why
he
approved
it
at
page
666
of
the
record.
he
said
that
although
the
decree
is
not
a
panacea
for
all
the
alleged
evils
besetting
the
society,
the
decree
does
represent
definite
improvement
over
existing
procedures,
and
that
it
will
serve
to
advance
the
antitrust
purposes
of
the
government
suit
and
of
the
prior
decree.
in
other
words,
judge
ryan
did
not
approve
this
decree
unless
and
until
he
was
satisfied
that
it
was
a
significant
step
in
improving
the
situation
carrying
out
the
antitrust
purposes.
now,
before
judge
ryan
reached
that
conclusion,
he
had
the
benefit
of
two
days
of
hearings
in
which
he
permitted
all
of
the
people
who
wish
to
speak
in
opposition
or
in
favor
of
the
decree
to
be
heard
including
these
very
appellants'
counsel
heard
at
length.
most
of
the
people
opposed
the
decree
significantly
at
least
two
opposite,
not
on
the
ground
that
it
didn't
do
enough,
but
it
went
too
far.
it
was
taken
too
much
away
from
the
existing
rights.
in
addition
to
that,
before
the
membership
voted
on
this
decree,
they
had
the
benefit
of
two
series
of
meetings.
a
meeting
was
first
held
in
new
york
and
in
--
on
the
west
coast
of
all
the
ascap
members
at
which
the
decree
was
explained
to
them
before
the
hearing
in
october.
following
that
meeting
and
after
the
hearing
when
the
judge
directed
that
it
be
again
submitted
to
the
membership,
further
meetings
were
held.
at
each
of
these
meetings,
counsel
for
ascap
explained
the
decree,
summarized
the
objections
to
it
and
stated
the
reasons
why
ascap
believed
it
was
appropriate.
and
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
he
put
it
--
mr.
--
mr.
horsky
put
it
in
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
alleged
that
they
would
be
prepared
to
prove
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
certain
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
would
have
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
the
--
the
basic
allegation,
the
basic
reasons
given
by
these
appellants
for
the
disapproval
of
the
consent
judgment,
i
want
to
make
it
quite
explicit
that
what
they
asked
in
their
pleading
and
intervention,
the
conclusion
of
their
pleading
as
intervention,
is
that
the
court
reject
this
proposed
consent
settlement.
that
is
what
they
asked,
were
it
reject
this
proposed
consent
settlement
and
not
approve
anything
that
did
not
contain
in
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but,
mr.
justice,
in
the
context
to
this
litigation
as
far
as
what
was
before
judge
ryan,
the
only
thing
he
could
do
is
either
approve
or
disapprove
this
proposed
consent
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
might
have
opened
up
at
that
time
if
they
were
permitted
to
intervene,
they
could
urge
further
modification.
but,
i
might
point
out
that
ascap
stated
at
the
hearing
that
if
any
testimony
were
taken,
they
would
immediately
withdraw
their
consent
to
the
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
goes
to
the
--
the
--
our
basic
argument,
our
basic
argument
in
the
case
that
a
private
party
does
not
have
the
right
to
come
in
on
the
side
of
the
government
in
effect
to
urge
that
the
government
is
not
adequately
representing
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
don't
have
--
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
think
that
is
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
our
first
proposition.
and
then
we
have
a
second
proposition
that
in
any
event,
on
basis
of
the
allegations
that
these
appellants
made
from
the
basis
of
which
they
predicated
their
claim,
that
the
government
was
not
adequately
representing
their
interest
that
does
not
establish
the
ultimate
conclusion.
now,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
might
just
briefly
indicate
a
few
more
of
the
fact
as
to
how
ascap
operates.ascap
has
roughly
6400
members.
it
grants
licenses
for
the
none
--
for
the
public
performance
for
profit,
the
playing
of
musical
compositions.
these
licenses
charge
for
a
fixed
sum,
for
a
stated
amount,
the
right
to
use
all
the
music
in
the
ascap
catalogue,
perhaps
a
ballroom,
a
radio
station
may
pay
$10,000
to
ascap
to
use
all
its
catalogue.
and
ascap
received
last
year
better
than
$30
million.
now,
under
ascap's
organization,
after
the
expenses
are
paid,
half
of
this
money
is
distributed
to
the
publishers,
the
other
half
is
distributed
to
the
writers,
the
authors
and
the
composers.
and
the
problem
that
arise
is,
of
course,
is
how
do
you
distribute
this
among
all
of
these
members.
on
what
basis
do
you
give
one
member
more
than
another?
now,
we
know
that
different
songs
are
played
but
we
don't
know
exactly,
specifically
which
song
is
played,
where
and
how
often.
so,
what
ascap
has
been
doing,
has
been
conducting
a
survey.
this
is
the
survey
that
mr.
horsky
has
mentioned.
they
have
conducted
a
survey
in
which
they
attempt
to
ascertain
just
how
many
of
these
songs
are
played
and
it's
done
on
a
sampling
basis
because
you
couldn't
hear
every
particular
composition
that
was
played.
and
if
you
could,
the
expense
of
such
a
hearing
will
be
such,
they
would
be
no
money
left
over
by
the
time
they
got
ready
to
distribute
it.
now,
there's
one
other
problem
that
arises
in
this
case.
there
are
two
different
types
of
used
music
basically,
one
is
the
so-called
feature
performance
where
song
is
sung,
is
played
by
an
orchestra.
the
other
is
the
so-called
background
use
of
music,
that
is,
as
a
theme
song
for
a
program
on
radio,
on
--
or
television,
a
musical
jingle,
"pepsi-cola
hits
the
spot",
that
kind
of
thing.
now,
there
are
so-called
recognized
works
in
the
musical
field.
for
example,
if
on
a
television
program,
easter
parade
is
heard
in
the
background,
this,
to
the
average
viewer,
connotes
the
idea
that
the
scene
is
being
set
for
easter.
if
the
lullaby
of
broadway
is
played,
you
expect
to
see
a
scene
of
broadway.
on
the
other
hand,
there's
a
lot
of
music
that
maybe
very
pleasant
that
serves
the
purpose
but
connote
--
connotes
no
particular
image
to
the
listener.
now,
the
result
is
that
ascap
feels,
and
i
think
quite
justifiably,
that
the
recognized
works,
the
works
which
connote
an
image
to
the
viewer,
these
are
entitled
to
something
more.
there
are
more
valuable
music.
and
as
more
valuable
music,
certain
greater
recognition
should
be
given
to
the
playing
of
that
kind
of
music
as
background
music,
then
is
given
to
the
playing
of
music
that
connotes
no
image
to
the
list.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
these
are
only
in
the
case
of
the
background
uses
of
music.
this
is
not
the
case
of
a
song
that
is
given
a
feature
performance.
now,
with
this
by
way
of
background,
let
me
turn
to
the
precise
claim
for
intervention
that
was
made
here.
the
appellants
do
not
claim
that
the
decree,
as
far
as
it
goes,
isn't
a
good
decree.
on
the
contrary,
they
concede
that
the
decree
has
made
improvements.
that
claim
is
basically
that
the
decree
doesn't
go
far
enough.
and
the
claim
is
that
the
decree
doesn't
go
far
enough
in
certain
specific
areas.
there's
no
objection
made
to
other
areas
in
the
decree.
indeed,
i
think
it's
highly
significant
that
there
is
no
objection
taken
to
the
aspect
of
the
decree
which
the
district
court
described
as
the
most
significant
change.
of
course,
this
question
of
the
power
of
the
directors,
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
minute,
all
turns
in
the
last
analysis
as
to
how
the
money
of
ascap
is
to
be
distributed.
that's
the
basic
concern,
who
is
going
to
get
what?
and
the
district
judge
described
as
the
most
significant
change,
the
change
that
had
been
made
in
the
distribution
of
the
revenues
of
ascap.
there
are
also
other
areas
in
which
the
government
had
concluded
that
the
decree
was
deficient.
and
as
to
those
areas,
there
is
no
attack
made.
so
what
we
think
we
come
down
to
hear
is
a
claim
that
the
government
has
inadequately
represented
the
public
interest
in
negotiating
this
decree
because
in
certain
areas,
the
relief
for
which
the
government
was
willing
to
settle
the
case
rather
than
going
to
litigation
is
less
than
what
appellants
believe
was
called
for
by
the
situation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
that
--
if
that
is
his
claim,
mr.
justice,
then
i
think
he
is
certainly
not
entitled
to
intervention
because
the
government,
in
representing
the
interests
of
the
public,
necessarily
has
to
look
to
a
broader
segment
than
the
interest
of
particular
appellants.
i
mean,
the
government
had
to
consider
in
negotiating
this
decree
all
members
of
ascap,
not
just
this
particular
group.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
that
is
--
if
that
is
so,
mr.
justice,
if
it
--
if
this
is
his
claim,
and
as
i
take
his
claim
really
is,
that
we
didn't
adequately
represent
the
public
interest
because
he
represents
the
segment
of
ascap
which
we
were
trying
to
protect,
and
we
haven't
done
enough
to
help
them.
but
if
his
claim
is
only
that
we
have
failed
adequately
to
represent
his
interest,
then
i
suggest
that
under
sale
principles,
that
is
clearly
does
not
entitled
to
intervene
because
i
think
he
claims
that
the
represent
--
if
he
claims
that
the
representation
of
his
interest
by
the
government
is
inadequate,
the
answer
to
that
is
basically
the
government
is
representing
the
whole
of
the
public
interest.
and
a
private
litigant,
we
don't
think,
can
come
in
to
a
government
suit
in
effect
on
the
side
of
the
government
merely
because
he
claims
that
in
conducting
its
litigation,
the
impact
of
what
the
government
is
doing
has
an
adverse
effect
on
him.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
1941,
the
basic
vice,
the
primary
vice
was
the
relationship
between
ascap
and
its
licensees.
that
was
the
primary
thrust
of
the
complaint.
the
secondary
thrust
of
the
complaint
was
the
fact
that
ascap,
by
virtue
of
this
controlling
group,
was
able
to,
in
effect,
hold
the
membership
and
bondage
at
that
point.
there
was
no
election
of
the
board
at
all.
the
board
perpetuated
itself
and
therefore,
you
had
this,
in
effect,
price
fixing
conspiracy
which
was
tightly
locked
in.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
was
--
it
was
alleged
that
--
it
was
alleged
that
the
entire
existence
of
ascap
itself
was
--
had
violated
the
sherman
act
in
various
particulars.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'd
say
rather
it
was
a
means
of
accomplishing
the
illegal
result.
i
don't
think
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
and
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
wasn't
the
heart
of
this
business.
and
of
course,
after
the
1941
judgment,
at
least
in
the
1950
judgment,
they
were
again
prime
--
primarily
dealt
with
the
relationship
between
ascap
and
the
licensees
but
the
present
proceeding
is
concerned
solely
with
the
relationship
among
the
ascap
membership.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
surely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely
there
was.
but
--
but
our
position
is
that
you
cannot
predicate
a
claim
that
the
department
was
unfairly
representing
the
public
interest
merely
because
it
shown
that
as
to
a
particular
segment
that
you
created
and
do
enough,
it
didn't
do
as
much
as
this
particular
people
think
it
should
have.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
mr.
justice,
but
we
still
maintain
that
even
if
that
was
so,
the
remedy
for
that
is
not
to
intervene
to
try
to,
in
effect,
take
over
the
control
of
the
government
litigation.
now,
we
think
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
are,
mr.
justice,
i
think,
because
of
this.
the
government
was
the
plaintiff
in
this
suit.
the
government,
it
seems
to
me,
under
normal
procedures
has
the
right
to
decide
how
it's
going
to
settle
its
litigation
on
what
terms,
on
what
conditions.
it's
up
to
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
it
will
approve
a
settlement
on
these
terms.
and
what
this
appellant
is
suggesting
is
even
though
the
government
has
concluded
after
careful
study,
after
lengthened
negotiation
that
this
matter
should
be
settled
on
these
terms.
they
come
in
and
say,
"no,
give
us
an
opportunity
to
show
that
something
more
than
the
government
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
is
asking
for."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
i
would
hesitate
to
say
never,
but
i
--
but
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
a
case
where
someone
could
come
in
on
the
government
side,
on
a
claim
that
the
government,
in
conducting
government
litigation,
is
not
adequately
protecting
the
interests
of
the
public
interest
or
the
private
interest
that
are
affected
as
the
result
of
the
government
litigation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
the
very
nature
of
government
litigation
is
such
that
this
is
not
the
basis
upon
which
intervention
maybe
had,
even
assuming
that
--
in
other
words,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
justice,
if
there
were,
for
example,
a
situation
were
it
will
claim
possibly
that
there
was
collision
that
kind
of
thing,
if
it
were
claimed
that
the
interest
of
the
government
were
--
upholds
to
those
of
the
intervenors,
i
can
concede
there
might
be
situations
then
when
you
might
have
intervention,
but
there's
no
claim
here
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
don't
think,
mr.
justice,
the
fact
that
the
government
may
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
terms
on
which
it
agrees
to
a
settlement
is
enough
to
justify
they
are
coming
in.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
precise.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
as
a
matter
of
discretion
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
they
--
they
sought
discretionary
intervention
that
was
also
denied
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
no,
mr.
justice.
now,
we
are
saying
we
don't
think
that
on
this
kind
of
a
claim,
they
establish
that
they
can
intervene
as
of
right
in
the
sense
that
the
representation
of
their
interest
by
the
government
is
inadequate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
think,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i
think,
mr.
justice,
i
think,
if
i
may
put
it
a
little
differently,
i
think
what
we're
saying
is
that
where
the
claim
is
made
that
they
have
the
right
to
intervene
as
of
right,
they
are
not
entitled
to
come
in
merely
because
it
is
claimed
that
the
government
is
improperly
conducting
its
litigation
in
the
sense
that
it
is
not
doing
it
the
way
they
think
it's
appropriate.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'm
saying
--
saying
that
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
--
he
doesn't
have
to
allow
them
in
because
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
while
the
judge
here
and
while
it's
the
usual
practice
in
these
consent
cases,
the
judge
did
not
permit
intervention,
he
listened
and
let
the
opponents
be
heard
at
great
length.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
that
is
a
development
which
i'll
try
to
come
to
in
a
moment.
we
think
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
generally,
it
does,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
generally,
it
does,
yes.
and
i
would
say
that
with
almost
no
exceptions,
with
one
or
two
exceptions,
intervention
and
this
kind
of
a
situation
has
been
consistently
denied.
now,
the
government
has
not
objected
to
a
presentation
by
the
objectors
to
permit
them
fully
without
becoming
party
to
make
their
full
argument
before
the
district
court
as
was
done
here.
the
--
we
--
we
think
basically,
this
is
inherent
in
the
whole
character
of
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
sherman
act.
the
sherman
act,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
the
borden
case,
sets
up
two
avenues
for
the
enforcement
of
the
sherman
act.
on
the
one
hand,
there
is
antitrust
enforcement
and
suits
brought
by
the
attorney
general
and
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
the
private
suits.
now,
these
two,
of
course,
are
complimentary
and
each
has
an
important
avenue
sherman
act
enforcement.
but,
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
the
private
party
could
get
into
the
government
suit,
and
particularly
we
think
that
is
so
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
where
a
consent
judgment
is
involved.
i'd
like
to
just
touch
on
that
brief
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
clayton
act
does
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
sherman
act
itself
does
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
under
the
clayton
act,
under
section
5
of
clayton
act
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
under
the
sherman
act
but
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
clayton
act
is
--
this
aspect
of
the
clayton
act
is
applicable
to
the
antitrust
cases.
section
5
of
the
clayton
act
provides
that
a
judgment
entered
in
a
suit
under
the
antitrust
laws
on
consent
before
the
taking
of
testimony
shall
not
be
private
--
prima
facia
evidence
of
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
just
--
i'm
just
indicating
that
there
is
reference
in
the
statute
to
consent.
now,
in
a
consent
judgment,
when
the
government
comes
to
negotiate
a
case
by
consent,
there
are
merely
the
factors
that
it
has
to
take
into
account,
problems
of
proof
for
example,
problems
of
its
legal
theories,
questions
as
to
whether
if
it
litigated
the
case,
it
would
win
the
case,
if
it
won
the
case,
would
it
get
all
the
relief
that
is
--
that
is
asking
for.
and
of
course,
the
government
frequently
will
settle
a
case
on
consent
for
something
less
than
it
is
asked
for
in
its
prayer
for
relief.
but
that,
it
seems
to
us,
is
clearly
no
basis
for
charging
that
the
government
has,
therefore,
inadequately
done
its
duty.
indeed,
the
suggestion
of
the
appellants
that
upon
the
claim
that
the
government
is
inadequately
protecting
the
public
interest,
that
alone
suffices
to
let
them
enter
the
case.
that
we
think
as
a
practical
matter
because
of
the
facts,
one,
that
defendants
in
antitrust
cases
are
unlikely
to
consent
if
there
is
any
testimony
taken,
and
two,
that
this
makes
them
a
party
to
all
the
consent
judgments.
as
a
practical
matter,
this
would
make
it
very
difficult
if
not
well
known
possible
to
have
this
basic
consent
judgment
program
under
which
a
very
substantial
number
of
antitrust
cases
are
disposed
of.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
the
court,
of
course,
in
its
discretion
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
all
i
could
--
could
say
to
that
is
that
the
rule
under
which
we
operate
here
is
very
specific
in
its
terms
of
what
this
court
has
indicated
are
the
appropriate
circumstances
for
letting
them
in.
the
court
--
i
--
consistently,
the
courts
do
listen
to
these
people,
the
court
and
in
this
very
case,
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
that
it
was
not
going
to
approve
the
decree
unless
it
was
satisfied.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that,
of
course,
is
true,
mr.
justice,
but
there
was
extensive
argument.
there
was,
in
effect,
every
argument
that
appellant
--
that
the
appellants
are
here
making
was
fully
canvassed
in
the
district
court.
now,
i
would
now
to
turn
basically,
briefly
to
the
grounds
upon
which
the
appellants
sought
to
intervene
the
theory
on
which
they
claim
that
the
representation
of
their
interest
by
the
government
here
was
inadequate.
i've
mentioned
earlier
the
problem
of
distribution
of
the
revenues,
how
the
money
is
to
be
distributed.
previous
to
the
1960
decree,
ascap
had
filed
a
very
cumbersome
system,
a
very
involved
system
of
distributing.
i'll
try
to
make
it
as
brief
as
possible,
what
amounted
to
was
--
and
take,
for
example,
the
case
of
the
writer
or
the
publisher,
after
it
had
received
the
total
amount
to
be
given
out
to
all
the
members
of
the
group,
it
then
divided
into
a
number
of
funds,
20%
went
to
one
fund,
30%
went
to
another
fund.
and
within
each
of
these
funds,
there
was
a
different
basis
of
distribution.
and
these
funds
were
weighted
so
that
the
people
who
had
been
members
of
ascap
for
a
longer
period
with
greater
seniority
and
the
--
and
who
had
more
claims
of
their
compositions
tended
to
get
a
greater
percentage
of
the
takedown
of
the
revenue.
now,
in
this
case
of
the
writers,
for
example,
only
20%
of
the
total
distributed
to
the
writers
was
given
on
the
basis
of
the
current
performances
of
these
songs.
other
portions
were
given
on
the
length
of
membership,
the
length
of
time,
that
certain
classical
songs
have
been
played
and
so.in
the
case
of
the
publisher,
it
was
a
little
bit
larger.
now,
this
was
the
government
considered
one
of
them
major
defect
of
the
system.
the
1950
decree
had
directed
that
ascap
distribute
its
revenues
so
as
to
get
primary
weight
to
the
performances
of
the
songs.
and
the
government
was
at
a
view
that
this
judgment
failed
to
do
that,
the
old
judgment.
now,
a
very
significant
and
basic
change
was
made
in
the
scheme
of
distribution
under
the
1960
judgment.
the
change
was
that
for
the
first
time,
the
writers
and
the
publishers
were
given
the
option
of
either
following
an
old
fund
system
but
with
modifications
to
correct
some
of
these
deficiencies
or
at
their
choice,
they
could
now
get
all
of
their
share
on
the
basis
of
their
current
performances.
this
means
that
a
new
writer,
one
who
is
not
old
and
established,
was
got
some
hints,
and
he's
generating
a
lot
of
money
can
on
--
for
the
first
time,
get
compensation
on
the
basis
of
the
current
performances
of
his
song.
now,
we
think
this
is
a
very
significant
thing.
now,
in
addition
to
that,
in
addition
to
that,
the
various
funds'
themselves,
the
composition
of
them
which
changed
and
it--
furthermore,
previously
ascap
had
had
the
power
to
make
great
discrepancies
in
the
amount
of
credit
given
to
the
same
song
used
for
background
purposes.
for
example,
sometimes
as
many
as
a
thousand
times,
more
credit
was
given
to
the
playing
of
one
song
as
a
theme
than
another.
that
is
all
have
been
cut
down
on
the
basis
on
which
they
can
give
less
than
full
credit
to
non-feature
uses
of
this
performance
has
been
specified.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
matter
which
is
the
principal
object
of
complaint
of
the
appellants
here
which
is
the
system
of
voting.
under
the
old
system
of
voting,
voting
was
based
upon
the
amount
of
income
that
a
member
got
from
ascap.
each
writer
was
given
one
vote
for
each
$20
of
income.
each
publisher
was
given
one
vote
for
each
$500
of
income.
that
has
been
changed
by
the
new
decree.
the
new
decree,
the
voting
system
is
based
not
on
the
income
that
this
man
received,
which
inevitability
would
tend
to
favor
those
who
had
been
longest
in
the
society
and
the
biggest
people,
but
on
the
basis
of
the
performances
of
their
music.
and
this,
we
think,
is
a
very
significant
change,
a
change
--
substantial
change
for
the
better.
now,
in
addition,
although
the
appellants
attempt
to
minimize
it,
the
percentage
of
control
of
the
top
10
publishers,
the
share
which
they
have
was
reduced
from
63%
to
37%.
this
was
done
by
a
system
of
graduated
voting
that
the
more
votes
you
get
--
the
more
performances
you
get,
i'm
sorry,
the
more
votes
when
--
the
more
performances
are
needed
for
each
vote,
so
that
as
you
get
bigger,
it
takes
more
performances
to
get
a
vote.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
principle
publisher.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
principle
publisher.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
--
it's
hard
to
say.
the
top
10
hold
30%
of
the
vote,
the
top
50
hold
approximately
half
of
the
vote
under
the
new
system.
but,
of
course,
let
me
explain
something,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
roughly
13
--
1300
or
1400
members
of
ascap.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
30%
--
37%
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
of
the
vote
initially
with
a
maximum
of
41%.
if
the
--
if
their
share
increases,
it's
provided
that
there
has
to
be
reallocation
so
they
don't
get
more
than
10%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
it
does,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
court
did
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
proposal
but
my
argument
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
my
argument
is
not
--
is
showing
the
fairness
of
the
settlement,
not
in
those
terms
but
it's
designed
to
show
that
their
contention,
the
ground
on
which
they
alleged
that
they
were
entitled
to
intervene
the
alleged
inadequacy
of
what
the
government
done.
in
fact,
it's
contradicted
by
the
very
elements
that
we
have
referred
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
the
decision
was
made
basically
on
the
decision
denying
intervention
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
was
made
on
the
basis.
we
think
that
the
government
adequately
represented
their
interest.
this
is
one
of
the
findings
on
which
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
--
they
wanted
to
offer
evidence
to
show
that
in
fact
the
judgment
which
--
to
which
the
government
agreed
did
not
adequately
carry
out
the
antirust
purposes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
what
--
i
have
to
ask,
mr.
justice.
what
point
do
they
seek
to
intervene
if
--
if,
for
example,
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
make
the
same
argument,
yes.
suppose
for
the
sake
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
--
no.
mr.
justice,
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference.
i
think
if
in
a
contested
case,
after
we
had
had
litigation,
and
let's
assume
it
was
held
that
the
defendants
had
violated
the
antitrust
laws
and
then
the
question
was
as
to
the
relief
to
be
given
and
particular
people
came
in
and
said,
"we
would
like
to
intervene
to
show
that
some
other
relief
than
that
proposed
by
the
government
is
what
the
court
should
enter,"
i
don't
think
that
in
that
situation,
they
are
entitled
to
come
in,
in
that
context.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
the
court
--
the
question
that
the
court
was
faced
with
was
whether
to
approve
this
particular
decree.
if
the
court
turned
down
this
particular
decree,
then
the
only
resort
could
be
how
to
be
the
litigation
under
the
reserve
power
to
modify
or
perhaps
even,
conceivably,
you
might
have
to
go
back
and
try
the
whole
antitrust
that
we
don't
know.
but,
we
think
it
would
interfere
with
the
antitrust
laws
because
as
the
court
himself
said
that
this
represents
the
substantial
improvement.
he
said
this
can't
be
recognized
this
judgment
isn't
perfect.
he
said
this
represents
a
substantial
improvement,
the
way
it's
open
under
this
judgment
for
the
government
to
move
at
any
future
time
under
the
reserved
power
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
i
wouldn't
--
i
couldn't
agree
with
that,
mr.
justice,
because
of
the
very
nature
of
the
whole
consent
decree
negotiation
power.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
--
the
court,
of
course,
is
always
free
to
dis
--
to
reject
the
consent
judgment.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
court
in
this
case
might
have
rejected,
of
course.
i
like
to
also
mention
in
connection
with
the
survey
that
has
been
spoken
of.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
have
to
answer
that
in
two
steps,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
initially,
i
would
agree
that
initially
it
would
appear
that
the
judge
rejected
this
on
the
theory
that
this
kind
of
a
showing
isn't
enough
to
allow
intervention.
but
after
the
whole
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
initially,
he
just
said,
"your
application
is
denied."
that's
the
first
step.
then
the
order
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i'm
--
i'm
saying,
mr.
justice
--
let
me
give
the
chronology.
the
application
to
intervene
was
filed
with
the
various
particulars.
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
on
october
19th,
the
various
people,
the
judge
said,
"well,
now,
who
wants
to
be
heard?"
and
mr.
horsky
said,
"i
have
this
application
to
intervene."
he
said,
"your
application
is
denied."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
just
like
that.
later
on,
he
explained
in
the
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
he
had.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
yes,
it
had
been
filed
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
a
week
before.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
later
on,
in
the
course
of
the
hearing,
the
court
explained
the
reasons
why
it
had
denied
the
intervention.
that's
at
pages
381
to
382,
the
bottom
of
the

and
then
the
formal
order
from
which
the
appeal
was
taken
in
effect
recites
those
claims.
but
the
point
--
the
reason
i
wanted
to
make
and
give
my
answer
to
you,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
two
parts
is
that
at
that
conclusion
of
the
hearings,
after
the
two
days
of
hearings
were
all
over,
the
appellants
again
renewed
their
motion
to
intervene,
and
the
court
again
rejected,
so
we
don't
know.
it
maybe
that
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
having
heard
all
their
presentation,
the
court
was
of
the
view
that
nothing
they
had
shown
changes
the
earlier
opinion.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
--
we
really
don't
know,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
suggestion
that
he
did
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
--
that
is
clearly
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
--
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
i
--
i
say
that
because
even
accepting
their
claims,
we
say
those
claims
in
the
particular
areas,
the
first,
the
counterbalance
by
other
things
that
certainly,
they
failed
to
take
account.
they
do
not
criticize
areas
of
the
judgment
where
there
are
substantial
improvements.
and
finally,
even
assuming
all
of
this,
even
assuming
that
in
this
particular
--
even
if
we
assume
arguendo
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
hadn't
gone
as
far
as
it
should
have,
nevertheless,
we
don't
think
that's
enough
to
enable
them
to
come
in
to
overturns.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
think
so,
mr.
justice,
because
the
public
interest
concepts
involved
in
formulating
an
appropriate
decree
under
the
sherman
act
necessarily
was
to
take
account
and
accommodate
various
competing
interests
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
even
though
these
people
may
not
have
been
benefited,
other
--
would
have
been
benefited,
and
the
government
and
the
district
court
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
reach
the
overall
conclusion
that
it
was
in
the
public
interest
and
further
the
purposes
of
the
suit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
--
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice.
in
this
--
in
this
--
we
--
we
dispute
that
the
pleading
has
but
--
that
far
reaching
an
impact
but
assuming
it
does,
assuming
it
does,
we
think
they
could
not
be
permitted
to
intervene
to
attack
the
validity
of
the
government's
conduct
of
this
litigation,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
we
have
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
which
we
have
to
look
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
of
course,
in
terms
of
what
they
allege
in
this
case.
i
mean
if
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
--
i'm
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
showing
if
they
had
made
some
other
showing.
i'm
saying
on
the
basis
of
the
showing
in
the
claim
they
have
made
here,
they're
not
be
entitled.
even
assuming
they
could
prove
everything
they
alleged,
assuming
they
could
prove
everything
they
alleged.
in
other
words,
this
pleading
was
not
sufficient
to
allow
them
to
intervene.
that's
our
position.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
we
may
assume
that
because
they
don't
criticize
the
judgment
as
it's
enacted.
but
i
just
want
to
answer
in
that
by
--
answer
that
to
point
out
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
could
achieve
substantial
inroads
if
this
consent
judgment
were
rejected,
and
we
were
forced
to
litigation.
we
don't
know
what
would
happen
in
the
event
of
litigating
this
proposed
modification.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
--
they
claim,
it
would
be
very
difficult
because
the
nature
--
in
other
words,
they
say
that
you
got
to
be
a
member
of
the
performing
right
society.
in
other
words,
it's
--
it's
not
feasible
for
an
individual
publisher
to
license
all
applicants
and
to
try
to
police
things.
there
is,
of
course,
another
--
two
other
organizations.
one
particularly,
broadcast
music
which
was
organized
by
the
radio
broadcast
as
of
1941
which
is
a
similar
society.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
assume
so,
and
they
themselves
recognized
the
importance
of
such
an
organization.
