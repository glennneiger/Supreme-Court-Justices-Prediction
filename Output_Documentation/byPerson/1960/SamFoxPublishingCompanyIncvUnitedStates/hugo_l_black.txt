what
page
is
that,
mr.
horsky?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
asking
to
do
that,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
asking
to
do
that,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
that
nobody
ever
can
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
could
prove.
suppose,
they
could
prove
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
just
simply
showed
that
the
government
was
making
a
mistake,
just
came
out
and
evidence
showed
it
afterwards.
you'd
still
allow
concentration
of
power
to
be
in
the
hands
of
--
if
you
will
get
the
most
out
of
the
concentration.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
arguments
you're
making
now
has
a
strict
relevancy
to
the
question
--
on
the
question
we
have
to
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
pass
on
the
merits
of
the
proposal
as
now
and
did
it
do
it
on
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
i
mean
what
you
are
arguing
is
that
you
made
an
excellent
settlement,
which
i
don't
deny.
i
don't
know
anything
about
it.
you're
arguing
that
you
made
an
excellent
settlement.
they're
arguing
that
you
haven't
so
far
as
they
concern
that
--
are
the
public
--
i
assume
that
you
can't
separate
the
interest
of
the
public
in
cases
of
this
kind.
they're
arguing
that
so
i'm
wondering
if
--
if
the
merits
of
the
--
what
should
have
agreed
on
now
is
really
a
--
as
much
as
part
to
play
in
making
a
decision.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
--
but,
as
i
understand
it,
the
--
the
decision
was
not
made
on
that
basis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
they
are
asking,
isn't
it,
is
the
right
to
offer
evidence
in
connection
with
the
--
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
stating
--
for
my
satisfaction,
at
least,
you
have
said
that
consent
judgments
and
--
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
this
was
not
a
consent
judgment?
suppose
you
were
litigating
this,
would
you
make
the
same
argument
about
that
right
to
intervene?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
set
up
if
you
want
to
change
and
went
for
the
court,
and
they
came
in
and
said
that
they
wanted
to
present
that
particular
view
point
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
difference
is
there
in
your
mind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
consent
judgment
and
the
contested
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
want
to
consume
your
time
unnecessary
to
discuss
things
you
do
not
want
to.
but
i
want
--
like
to
know
if
why
--
if
why,
if
it
would
permitting
them
to
intervene
does
an
injury
to
the
antitrust
law
in
this
particular
case,
in
connection
will
let
them
decide
that
the
court
decide
or
whether
the
evidence
they
offer
is
--
might
bring
about
difference
in
what
kind
of
decree
he
would
consent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
think
it'd
be
some
argument
on
the
side
to
--
to
say
that
consent
decree
more
than
a
regular
finding,
that
you
are
fighting
it
out,
that
in
a
consent
decree,
that
in
the
long
run,
there
might
be
more
reason
to
permit
intervenors
to
come
in
than
in
one
that's
not
in
consent
decree,
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
defeat
it
sometimes.
i
agree
--
conceding
that,
you
might
defeat
it
sometimes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
maybe
it
should
be
defeated
sometime.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
--
anything
appears
in
it
as
to
what
would
happen
if
they
withdrew
from
ascap
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
prompted
by
this
colloquy
that
had
just
taken
place
that
raises
a
question
in
my
mind.
do
i
understand
that
you're
saying
that
this
is
an
individual
contest
between
him
and
other
members
of
ascap?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
this
decree
as
between
the
government
and
ascap
would
leave
these
people
free
to
protect
their
rights
as
against
the
other
members
of
ascap
in
a
lawsuit
among
themselves?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
that
they
would
be,
in
any
way,
handicapped
by
this
decision
as
one
res
adjudicata?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
position
is
then
that
the
government
is
acting
here
in
connection
with
the
public
interest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
a
way
that
goes
as
far
as
it
does,
and
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
intervenors
are
seeking
to
bring
in
a
dispute
which
is,
in
reality,
between
themselves
and
other
members
of
ascap
and
that
they
are
still
free,
wholly
free
to
litigate
the
very
thing
that
they
say
in
a
suit
where
they
and
the
other
members
of
ascap
can
compete
with
one
another
in
court.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
it,
your
complaint
is
not
that
the
decree
is
wrong
and
going
too
far
in
protecting
your
client,
but
it's
wrong
and
not
going
precedent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
it
be
res
adjudicata
as
to
discrimination
work
by
the
directors
against
your
client,
should
they
do
so
hereafter,
in
the
distribution
of
funds?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then,
does
the
decree
afford
to
settle
all
controversies
between
you
and
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
does
it
simply
provide
a
way
in
which
both
shall
recant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
the
government
has
consented
to
a
decree
and
from
your
standpoint,
which
fixes
without
possibility
of
your
avoiding
it,
a
distribution
which
will
work
a
discrimination
against
your
clients?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
there
is
no
way
for
them
to
avoid
that
without
coming
in
conflict
with
this
decree?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
are
wrong
on
that,
what
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
would
that
have
on
your
right
of
intervention?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
supposing
now
that
the
decree
is
not
res
adjudicata
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
bar
your
clients
from
bringing
an
action
to
prevent
what
you
call
the
unfair
discrimination
against
your
client,
why
--
if
--
if
that
is
true,
would
you
have
a
right
to
intervene?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you're
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
far
what?
