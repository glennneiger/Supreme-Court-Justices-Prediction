you
mean
as
amicus
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
mind,
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
from
the
original
conception
of
this
action,
what
years
ago
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
whenever
it
--
whenever
it
was,
had
there
been
any
intervenors
allowed
in?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
been
denied.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
indication
that
it
would
in
the
trainmen's
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
is
that
it's
discretionary
with
the
court.
the
court
could
let
him
in
if
they
wanted
to.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
court
has
no
power
in
this
rule
either
in
its
discretionary
aspect
or
as
a
right
aspect,
doesn't
apply
to
government
antitrust
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
this
suit
had
been
brought
only
against
ascap,
presumably
the
reach
of
this
decree
consented
to
would
have
been
--
could
have
been
just
the
same.
would
that
affect
your
position?
