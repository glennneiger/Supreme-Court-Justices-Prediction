about
how
many
--
about
how
many
voted?
chief
justice
earl

close
enough.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
close
enough,
right.
chief
justice
earl

yes.
chief
justice

warren
you

mr.

mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
government
invariably
object
to
intervention
and
matters
of
this
kind?
chief
justice
earl
warren
generally,
it
does.
chief
justice
earl
warren
may
i
ask
you
this
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
suppose
--
suppose
we
accept
as
true
everything
that
is
in
their
complaint
and
intervention
and
everything
in
their
memorandums
that
a
company
--
do
you
still
say
that
they
have
no
right
to
--
to
intervene?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
and
--
and
you
do
that
without
regard
to
what
the
--
what
is
shown
in
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
more?
suppose
--
suppose
that
there
was
improvement
in
the
decree
but
none
of
the
improvement
helped
this
particular
people,
would
you
still
think
they
have
no
right
to
intervene?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
take
--
then
it
is
your
position
that
no
bad
--
bad
--
no
matter
how
badly
these
people
have
been
injured
and
will
be
injured
under
the
new
decree,
they
could
not
state
a
--
a
cause
of
action
that
would
entitle
them
to
intervene.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no
--
no
matter
how
badly
they
were
being
treated
by
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
by
the
dominant
interest
in
ascap
or
by
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
proposed
decree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
but
i
started
with
the
alleging,
and
you
said
that
isn't
enough
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
then
i
went
to
the
question,
"could
they?"
and
--
and
you
said
no.
you
thought
they
could
not
make
a
showing
that
would
entitle
them
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
dooling.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
--
chief
justice

warren
publishing
company,
incorporated,
et
al.,
appellants,
versus
united
states,
et
al.
mr.
dooling,
you
may
conclude
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
thought,
mr.
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.

(voice

chief

mr.
horsky.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horsky.
would
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mind
addressing
yourself
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
dooling
at
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
horsky,
at
the
opening
of
your
argument,
i
thought
you
stressed
the
fact
that
--
that
the
court
had
taken
no
evidence
on
your
--
your
motion
to
intervene
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
it
--
it
had
made
no
findings
but
had
merely
given
you
an
order
that
--
preventing
him
from
intervening.
now,
suppose
that
he
had
admitted
evidence,
under
your
complaint
and
your
memorandums
that
were
filed
--
filed
with
it,
and
he
had
made
findings
and
had
concluded,
on
the
evidence,
that
you
were
not
entitled
to
--
to
intervene
because
the
public
interest
had
been
taken
care
of,
would
that
be
supportable
or
do
you
--
or
do
you
contend
that
you
have
an
absolute
right
to
intervene
because
of
--
of
the
interest
that
you
have
in
the
--
in
the
outcome
of
this
litigation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
true,
they
don't
constitute
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice

--
grounds.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
wouldn't
get
to
--
you
wouldn't
get
to
the
second
one
unless
he
permitted
you
to
intervene.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
i'm
talking
about
is
the
first
one.
would
the
--
would
his
conclusion
that
you
are
not
entitled
to
--
to
intervene
be
supportable
if
he
had
taken
evidence
and
had
made
adequate
findings
to
the
effect
that
the
public
interest
had
been
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you,
mr.
horsky.
