justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
that
date,
mr.
horsky?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
preceded
this
memorandum
for
which
you
quoted
to
follow,
was
later.
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
whom
did
that
rule
go?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
nominal
parties
--
the
litigating
parties
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
but
not
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
individual
members
of
ascap.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
may
have
missed
something.
was
there
before
the
court
or
had
that
there
been
published
the
kind
of
consent
decree
that
again
would
be
suggested
or
agreed
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
before
your
present
appellant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
actual
terms
of
the
proposal.
justice
felix
frankfurter
proposed
consent
degree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
before
you
do
that,
will
you
or
--
or
mr.
friedman
return
to
the
third
ground
that
applicants
have
permitted
this
cause
in
which
they
are
not
named
as
parties
to
proceed
to
judgment?
i
understood
from
your
recital,
mr.
horsky,
that
after
this
--
after
this
agreed
to
propose
consented
decree,
which
doubtless
was
preceded
by
negotiation,
etcetera,
that
that
was
made
public,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
i
mean
the
1959
one,
the
proposed
1959
decree.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
that
was
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
made
public
after
--
in
june,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
how
assume
that
of
--
before
this
agreed
--
this
proposed
consent
decree,
certainly
the
thing
hadn't
--
one
didn't
know
whether
the
government
would
or
would
not
consent,
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
don't
care
about
the
earlier
one,
i
mean
the
1959
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
in
--
what
was
the
incipiency
of
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
i
don't
want
to
take
undue
amount
of
time
in
--
in
excessive
display
of
my
ignorance,
but
is
that
--
you
couldn't
have
intervene
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
at
the
times
--
beginning
--
beginning
of
the
time
in
which
you
can
be
charged
with
anything
is
this
submission
in
june.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
but
it
could
be
earlier
than
june.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
how
soon
after
june
which
had
a
return
day
for
october,
how
soon
thereafter?
did
you
ask
to
come
on
the
24th?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
all
event,
before
the
court
took
any
action
or
before
anybody
would
take
any
action.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
--
yes
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
this
means,
permitted
this
cause
in
which
the
amount
him
to
proceed
the
judgment,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
and
that
stated
november
16
of
this
order.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
have
done
anything
prior
to
june.
the
court
in
june
announced
the
return
day
in
october.
before
the
return
day
came,
you
duly
ask
to
intervene
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
on
--
and
on
november
16,
you
were
told
that
--
that
you
allowed
this
go
to
judgment,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
anything
--
anything
in
between
24
(a)
and
(b),
in
other
words,
(a)
is
--
as
of
right
and
(b)
is
permissive
in
the
exercise
of
dis
--
of
discretion?
is
there
such
a
thing
as
an
abusive
discretion
which
would've
amount
to
a
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
--
would
an
abuse
under
24
(b)
in
effect
be
--
come
under
(a)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
may
have
clear
cases
in
312
if
you
found
it
to
be
clearly
of
--
as
of
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
very
turn
of
the
original
decree.
it
maybe
not
that
and
yet
under
the
circumstances
be
such
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
all
good
fairness,
you
ought
to
be
allowed
to
come
in.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
argument
implied,
does
is
not,
that
voting
confidence
in
the
directors
implies
agreement
with
the
proposed
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
at
this
point,
you're
--
you're
attacking
the
suggestion
that
the
directors
appropriately
or
adequately
represented
the
appellant
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
people
very
often
vote
for
representatives,
although
they
meant
to
disagree
as
to
some
of
the
views
they
entertained.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
it
doesn't
imply
that
the
members
--
that
the
voting
members
had
before
them
appropriate
basis
for
judging
the
adequacy
of
the
directors.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
whether
at
anytime
your
clients
made
informal
or
loyal
representations
to
the
department
as
submitted
considerations?
justice
felix
frankfurter
either
prior
to
the
formulation
or
prior
a
prior
or
b
between
june
and
october.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
it's
a
large
group.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
the
--
i'm
sorry.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
thought
those
were
affected,
they
were
a
large
group.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
used
of
95%.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
you
--
mean
with
the
reference
to
the
enterprise
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
take
it,
you
made
in
your
--
in
your
moving
papers
for
intervention,
you
made
a
detailed
criticism,
from
your
point
of
view,
the
inadequacy
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
of
what
the
government
is
concerned
to
do.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
government
agree
that
you
would
be
--
you
are
bound
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
apart
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
apart
from
that,
perhaps,
in
the
freedom
in
the
lawsuit
advert
to
a
difficulty
i
have,
if
you
are
not
bound,
then
the
consent
agreement
arrangement
between
the
government
and
the
parties
is
definitive
and
you
have
sherman
or
consent
decree
subsequently
opened
up
to
further
litigation
insofar
as
you
are
open
to
challenges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
friedman,
whether,
at
that
hearing
before
judge
ryan,
counsel
on
behalf
of
the
present
appellants
set
forth
reasons
why
in
order
to
make
effective
their
--
criticism
of
the
proposed
decree,
they
must
have
the
compulsory
powers
of
a
party?
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
could
do
it
their
motion
papers,
couldn't
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
i
mean
if
they
were
parties,
they
have
powers,
they
would
have
powers.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
i
want
to
know
is
that
that
--
that
need
canvas
before
judge
ryan
and
that
the
department
make
answer
thereto,
and
you
will
make
anthem
in
the
course
of
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
have
to
be
a
party,
is
all
it
has.
justice
felix
frankfurter
there's
no
reason
for
rejecting
everything
they
asked.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
as
--
as
the
--
as
the
litigate
--
as
the
proceedings
shift
themselves
before
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
he
granted
into
the
--
the
pleading
the
--
the
petition
for
intervention,
that
might
have
opened
up
the
avenues
of
inquiring
that
weren't
opened
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
and
so
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
need
to
make
that
universal
statement,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
get
done
the
exactly
what
mr.
horsky
said,
that
means
if
the
--
that
in
a
litigation
where
--
in
which
the
government
is
a
party,
it
cannot
be
--
no
claim
can
be
made
that
the
government
doesn't
adequately
represent
everybody
on
the
same
--
in
the
same
general
directory
which
it
is
seeking
to
go.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
your
proposition,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
it
make
sense
to
ask,
what
was
the
underlying
vice
against
which
the
government
moved
in
1941?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
interrelationship
of
the
constituent
members
of
ascap
was
also
a
violation
of
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
but
one
aspect
was,
the
--
the
way
they
--
in
which
they
worked
out
interrelationship
among
the
members,
is
that
right
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
relation
--
in
relation
to
the
power
exerted
by
ascap,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
don't
care
how
you
phrase
it.
at
all
event,
that
was
--
that
was
--
that
also
went
to
the
nature
of
the
claim
made
by
the
government
in
invoking
the
sherman
law
against
ascap.
justice
felix
frankfurter
therefore,
a
proper
accomodation
within
ascap,
as
a
means
of
exerting
its
influence
beyond,
was
a
continuing
aspect
of
--
of
the
vice
of
the
violation
to
sherman
law,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
therefore
--
therefore,
a
--
the
--
the
mechanism
by
which
funds
were
gathered
and
distributed
was
at
the
heart
of
this
business,
was
it
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
though,
whichever
way
you
put
it,
i
prefer
your
way,
there
is
an
identification
between
the
public
interest
that
the
department
of
justice
was
protecting
and
the
relation
of
these
appellants
to
that
public
interest.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
but
if
it
left,
it
says,
good
reasons
for
believing.
i'm
not
suggesting
remotely
there
is.
if
there
is
a
good
reason
for
believing
that
the
so-called
process
of
democratization
was
--
was
badly
--
was
not
adequately
served,
then
you
still
go
to
the
heart
of
what
you
claim
in
starting
the
suit
in
1941.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
taking
over
the
control?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
do
you
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
enough
to
--
to
require
the
judge
to
hear,
i'm
assuming,
of
course,
good
faith
and
so
on.
that's
not
an
issue.
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
case
cannot
be
made
out
by
somebody
asking
the
court
to
listen
to
evidence
that
the
situation
involved
such
sophistication
of
such
technicality
that
with
every
goodwill
in
the
world,
the
particular
lawyers
of
the
government
did
not
penetrate
into
the
documents
of
the
situation.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
you
say
this
kind
of
a
claim,
then
you
were
excluding
as
a
matter
of
some
rigid
or
defined
principle
this
kind
of
a
claim.
if
you
say
on
this
evidence
or
these
proposals
or
these
proverbs,
i
follow
you
that
when
you
say
on
this
kind
of
a
claim,
then
you
draw
a
legal
line
that
against
the
government
such
a
claim
cannot
be
entertained
by
the
court
unless
he
chooses
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
rather
the
other
way
around
that
he
must
--
that
--
that
as
a
matter
of
right,
they
can't
make
such
an
offer
with
a
readiness
to
show,
and
the
court
didn't
--
without
considerations,
they
haven't
listened
to
you.
this
is
the
government.
that's
what
you're
saying,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
when
you
say
improperly
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
judge,
and
he
gives
no
ear,
he
gives
no
ear
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
proposal
to
which
the
government
is
consenting
in
utmost
good
faith
and
with
thorough
carefulness
and
considering
it
but
with
all
the
limitation
and
infirmities
of
even
excellent
lawyers
that
the
judge
need
--
pay
no
attention
to
it
at
all.
they
can
just
throw
it
out
because
it's
the
government.
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
is
a
different
story.
he
just
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
the
sherman
law
itself
deal
with
consent
judgment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
talking
about
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
consent
proceeding,
you're
talking
about
consent
proceeding,
isn't
something
created
by
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
just
part
of
the
general
equitable
procedure.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
under
the
clayton
act?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that's
--
i
don't
think
that
relates
to
this
problem
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
friedman,
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way
at
all.
i
wouldn't
start
with
the
right
of
the
potentially
intervenors.
but
in
as
much
as
this
consent
judgments
are
the
judgments
of
the
court
with
the
court's
responsibility
of
being
duly
advised
in
entering
and
canvassing
proposed,
and
eventually
entering
a
judgment
or
not
entering
or
modifying
with
this
proposed,
i
should
say
for
the
protection
of
the
court,
there
is
a
region
in
which
the
court
ought
not
to
deny
itself
to
the
light
that
comes
from
a
proper,
that
the
proposed
decree
is
inadequate,
not
that
the
department
is
incompetent
but
that
the
court
needs
age
which
it
offered,
it
ought
not
to
reject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
do
you
say
to
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
but
it
can't
say
"in
my
discretion,
i
won't
listen
to
something
that's
very
relevant."
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
call
that
discretion.
i
call
that
shutting
off
light.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
--
you
know
as
well
as
anybody,
perhaps,
certainly
better
than
i.
that's
no
use
of
listening
if
you
haven't
got
the
underpinning
of
the
claim
that's
made
that
inquiry,
interrogation,
discovery
of
suggestion,
cross-examination,
brings
out
the
facts
that
are
buried
under
--
under
--
in
near
argument
without
facts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
say
the
prominent
--
what
phrase
--
what
adjective
did
you
use,
the
prominent
publishers
or
leading
publishers?
justice
felix
frankfurter
principle.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
in
number,
roughly?
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
many
publishers
in
the
--
in
ascap?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
the
top
10
have
30%
of
the
vote?
justice
felix
frankfurter
37%.
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
move
on
from
that.
i'd
like
to
ask
you
this.
the
--
the
rejection
of
the
pleading
for
intervention
was
not
based
--
is
there
any
suggestion
that
was
based
under
the
assumption
or
under
the
belief
by
the
judge
with
some
familiarity
and
reconsider
familiarity
with
this
problem
if
the
problem
raised
by
ascap,
that
on
the
face
of
it,
what
you're
proposing
to
prove
is
unimportant,
isn't
much
of
an
advance
on
what
the
government,
if
you
--
even
if
you
can
establish
it,
but
the
government
has
(inaudible)
true
negotiation.
you
can't
--
the
likelihood
of
establishing
it
is
very
remote
are
none
of
those
considerations
with
the
rejection
made,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
record,
is
--
did
you
say
something
to
that
effect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
said
that
--
that
the
showing
isn't
important
or
enoughs.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
like
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
had
he
read
it
before
he
denied
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
it
had
been
before.
i
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
before.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
am
i
wrong
in
saying
that
there's
no
intimation
by
the
judge
that
he
thought
on
the
phase
of
this,
the
claim
which
they
were
trying
to
press
to
the
appropriate
process
of
a
--
of
a
litigation,
examination
of
witnesses,
etcetera,
that
there
is
no
suggestion
that
he
rejected
it
on
that
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there's
no
suggestion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
coming
from
his
lips
that
that's
the
ground.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
add
--
may
i
ask
one
more
question
in
relation
to
that.
i
--
i
infer
or
may
i
infer
or
is
there
implied
in
what
you
said
in
answer
to
chief
justice's
question,
that
the
--
assuming
the
ability
to
establish
what
their
petition
for
intervention
offer
to
establish,
and
assuming
further
--
and
assuming
further
that
by
establishing
that
so
that
a
decree
would
be
responsive
to
what
they
seek
to
prove,
they
would
not,
in
any
wise,
cut
down
the
arrangement
which
the
government
had
arrived
at?
in
other
words,
to
yield
to
their
proof,
and
therefore,
the
consequences
of
their
proof
would
not
make
inroads
on
the
good
that
the
government,
by
its
on
settlement,
had
achieved?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
may
assume
that,
may
i
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
that
is
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
practical
thing,
the
practical
business
matter
when
one
does
have
to
belong
to
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
take
evidence
with
reference
to
the
submitted
consent
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
that
apply
also
to
the
calling
in
the
federal
trade
commission
to
make
comment
on
the
proposed
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
that's
why
i'm
asking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
no,
that's
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
i
assume,
it
wouldn't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
basis
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
which
--
on
which
modification
could
be
sought?
i
suppose
the
decree,
the
1950
decree
must
have
left
open
in
modification
to
the
future
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
not
nearly
by
virtue
of
violations
of
the
existing
decree
but
by
virtue
the
fact
that
experience
had
shown
that
the
decree
was
inadequate.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
pleading
must
--
need
not
the
pleading
set
forth
with
particularity
why
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
you
want
to
intervene
and
what
you
propose
to
show
by
the
intervention?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
that
means
--
does
that
mean
that
these
appellants,
in
your
view,
would
raise
the
--
the
--
would
challenge
specific
provisions
as
to
voting
rights,
as
to
money
distribution?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
complete
this
suit
out
of
the
decree?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
his
own
right
as
--
as
a
matter
of
dominant
sense.
i'm
talking
about
the
right
which
is
the
consent
decree
adjudicated
as
to
the
proper
way
of
conserving
the
public
interest
under
the
sherman
law,
and
he's
speaking
be
--
that
he
may
say
that
by
this
--
by
the
terms
of
the
decree,
in
behalf
of
the
public,
i
am
shut
off
--
i
am
--
i
am
subjected
to
a
subordinating
position
from
what
would
be
right
if
the
public
interest
had
properly
been
concerned.
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
split
open
the
--
as
chap,
isn't
--
it's
a
metaphysical
entity,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
it
isn't
that,
i
mean,
according
to
your
view,
it's
the
metaphysical
entity
apart
from
its
members.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
it's
inclusive
of
its
members,
then
why
can't
the
member
challenge
as
to
what
are
these
--
one
of
the
decreed
against
the
entity
of
which
he
calls
that
kind
of
a
part
in
which
he,
to
some
extent,
pleads
by
being
a
member
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
my
suggestion
is
that
he's
part
of
the
whole.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he's
been
asserting
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
he
has
been
asserting
a
specific
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
says
it's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
--
he's
saying
the
public
interest
which
was
adjudicated
which
includes
me
as
part
of
the
equity
against
which
a
decree
has
been
entered.
i
must
say
you
are
cutting
it
pretty
fine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
just
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
what
he's
pressing
isn't
something
individual
and
restricted
to
him.
if
he
prevailed
in
his
claim,
he
would
undercut
the
whole
internal
arrangement,
not
just
as
to
him
co-ad
hoc
him,
he
would
be
undercutting
the
decree
whereby
the
present
voting
scheme
is
enforced.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
seems
to
me
that
it
--
but
--
isn't
of
individual
rights
that
he's
claiming.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
prevailed,
everybody
will
be
affected
in
the
whole
ascap,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
then
it
can't
be
just
an
individual
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
he
could
start
a
class
suit.
i'm
suggesting
that
by
the
arrangement
which
is
decreed,
he
inevitably
is
part
of
the
net
that
has
been
--
that
has
been
woven.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
is
an
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
adjudication
of
the
status
of
every
member
of
ascap
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
so
long
as
this
decree
stand,
and
i
think
the
upshot,
if
i
may
say
so,
is
that
either
you
or
i
is
begging
the
question.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
be
ours
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
may
be
ours
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh,
but
[laughter]
it
would
seem
that
i
do
not
respect
reason.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
would
but
i
do
like
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
no
lawyer,
if
now
suit
were
brought
by
these
appellants
against
ascap,
that
no
lawyer
would
even
dream
of
saying
that
the
decree,
the
1959
--
the
--
the
latest
decree
had
any
relation
to
that
suit.
not
you
because
you've
made
your
position
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
--
you
would
think
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
him
as
poor
lawyer
speaking.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
merely
a
mechanism
for
determining
substantive
issues.
it,
itself,
provides
certain
--
justice
felix
frankfurter

(voice

substantive
issues.
