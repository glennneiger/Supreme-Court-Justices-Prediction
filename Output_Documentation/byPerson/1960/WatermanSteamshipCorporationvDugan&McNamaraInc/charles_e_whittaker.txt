unloading,
who
control
that
matter?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
stevedore.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
there
was.

(inaudible)
justice

so
do
in
the
crumady-fisser
case,
as
i
recall,
the
court
held
that
the
contract
existing
between
the
treasurer
and
the
stevedore
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
shipowner.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now,
then
there
was
hence
as
--
a
privity
in
the
sense
there
but
in
this
case,
you
have
stipulated,
have
you
not,
that
no
contractual
relationship
existed
between
this
parties?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
wonder
if
that's
open
to
you
having
stipulated
that
there
is
no
contractual
relation
between
these
parties.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
regard
that
as
still
open
under
this
stipulation.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
that
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
that
was
directed,
as
i
understand
it,
to
dealings
with
contractual
indemnity.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
even
if
subject
to
that
construction,
mr.
beechwood,
do
you
read
the
opinion
as
proceeding
on
that
too?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
one
more
question
about
this
issue.do
you
argue
here
that
the
court
did
not
find
--
the
court
did
find
some
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
ship
in
this
stow
as
in
ryan?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes,
this
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
the
trial
court
said
on
page
14
in
sustaining
the
motion
for
the
court
to
act
further
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
that
there
was
no
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
ship
and
that
was
not
the
theory
of
his
action.
he
found
here
that
the
negligence,
if
there
was
any,
goes
on
the
part
of
the
stevedore,
didn't
he?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
wouldn't
they
have
had
to
pay
under
the
theory
of
hawn,
sieracki,
two
persons
who
enjoyed
both
shore-based
employees,
enjoyed
the
rights
of
seamen?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
wouldn't
the
ship
be
liable
simply
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
because
it
was
a
ship?
