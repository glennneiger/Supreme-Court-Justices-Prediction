mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
but
i
thought
we
crossed
that
--
those
waters
after
in
ryan.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
unilateral
--
unilateral
contractural
is
a
very
nice
way,
is
it
not?
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
i
think
--
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
--
i
pose
--
that
means
that
all
for
mate
to
the
world
without
knowing
who
the
world
might
be.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
that's
merely
all
fictitious,
isn't
it?
that's
merely
a
way
of
reaching
a
result
if
you
have
to
reach
it
that
way
and
when
you
want
to
reach
it.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
well,
i
--
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
--
i
think
the
circumstances
are
realistic
but
--
but
to
talk
about
the
unilateral
contract,
it
--
it
requires
some
adaptation
of
the
year,
doesn't
it?
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
but
the
--
the
real
reason
is
that
the
stevedore
is
held
because
he,
really,
is
the
party
that
has
done
the
damage
and
the
damage
they
have
or
shouldn't
be
paid
by
the
innocent
person
with
the
matter
of
law
ultimately
has
to
pay
it
--
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
is
that
the
only
reason?
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
so
why
don't
we
talk
about
this?
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
i
haven't
brought
up
by
a
theory
that
--
that
naturally,
more
familiar,
sounds
to
me
more
rational
than
unilateral
contract.
i
will
call
it
--
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
--
i
think
the
perfect
--
i
think
the
perfect
instance,
if
you
think
of
it
(inaudible)
contractual
liability
--
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
--
that
it's
unjust
between
these
two
people
that
the
stevedore
ship
get
off
when
his
--
the
fellow
who
really
did
it.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
i
had
to
admire
that
phrase,
mr.
mount.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
i
--
i
meant
admire.
i
simply
said
that
my
ears
get
accustom
to
it.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
yes.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
the
reason
--
the
reason
--
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
the
reason
they're
not
being
joint
tortfeasors,
i
think
it
is
because
in
one
case,
the
unseaworthiness
obligation
with
the
shipowner
is
imposed
by
law.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
well,
it's
imposed
by
law.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
not
through
--
yes,
because
he's
a
shipowner.
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
because
he's
a
shipowner.
and
the
other
thing
is
an
assumed
obligation
to
exercise
certain
care
and
the
question
is
to
whom
does
that
obligation
run
if
there's
a
big
fault
in
carrying
it
out?
isn't
that
the
situation?
mr.
mr.justice
frankfurter
and
from
that
you
--
you
do
said
that
the
two
justices
you've
mentioned
is
now
agreeing
with
justice
black's
dissent
in
ryan,
is
that
it?
