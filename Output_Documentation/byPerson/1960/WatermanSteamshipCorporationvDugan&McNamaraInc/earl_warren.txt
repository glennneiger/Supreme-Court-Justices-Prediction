of
the
record
--
chief

--
isn't
it?
chief

and
to
that
opinion,
judge
biggs
and
judge

were
the
dissenters.
chief

i
beg
your
pardon.
chief

yes,
i
see.

mr.
mount,
justice
frankfurter's
question
was
on
the
basis
that
the
negligence
was
all
of
the
stevedores
and
that
the
shipowner
is
innocent.
is
that
--
is
that
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
there
--
if
--
if
there
is
no
contract
between
these
two
and
they're
both
guilty
of
negligence,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
this
just
be
enforcing
the
contribution
from
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
how
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
don't
think
you
quite
get
my
point.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
well,
this
--
this
is
the
--
this
is
what
i
had
in
mind.
these
other
cases
that
we've
had
did
envow
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore.
this
one
in
this
case,
there
is
admittedly
no
contract
between
the
two
and
according
to
your
statement
a
moment
ago,
this
is
simply
a
case
where
--
where
both
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
were
guilty
of
--
of
negligence,
the
shipowner
in
not
having
stowed
the
ship
properly
and
the
stevedore
in
not
unloading
the
boat
properly.
now,
are
they
not,
i
don't
say
they
are
but
the
question
comes
into
my
mind,
are
they
not
just,
in
that
situation,
just
joint
tortfeasors
and
if
they
are,
is
there
a
contribution?
should
there
be
contribution
between
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
was
a
contractual
relationship
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
--
between
the
stevedore,
in
ryan,
there
was
a
contractual
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
between
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
stevedore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
who
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
--
i
know
that.
let's
see,
in
fisher
who
is
the
contract
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
the
--
the
charterer
has
a
contractual
relationship
to
the
owner.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
--
i
merely
asked
a
question.
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
don't
have
any
--
i
don't
have
any
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
firm
belief
on
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beechwood.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
beechwood,
before
you
get
away
from
that,
would
you
mind
stating
for
me
just
the
difference
in
the
degree
of
responsibility
of
the
shipowner
in
this
case
and
in
the
ryan
case.
as
i
recalled
it,
they
were
both
imperfect
stow,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
where
--
where
--
i
--
where
in
this
difference
in
responsibility
between
the
two
shipowners?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no.
i
--
i
understood
you
saying
it
was.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
on.
yes,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
sir.
you
have
--
you
have
seven,
eight
minutes
before
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
there'll
be
a
white
light,
five
minutes
before
your
time
is
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
gentlemen,
it
is
so
close
to
our
german
time
but
i
think
we
will
not
start
the
--
the
next
case
this
time.
we'll
recess
now.
