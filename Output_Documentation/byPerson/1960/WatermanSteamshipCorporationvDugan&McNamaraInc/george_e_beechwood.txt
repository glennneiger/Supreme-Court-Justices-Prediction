mr.
george
e.
beechwood
mr
chief
justice,
mr.
justices.
may
we
start
out
on
this
case
on
the
pleadings
of
the
injured
longshoreman
who
alleged
that
the
ship
improperly
stowed
the
cargo
and
cause
an
unsafe
place
to
work
and
cause
the
vessel
to
be
unseaworthy.
now,
that
in
itself
would
not
be
particularly
binding
upon
this
petitioner.
this
petitioner
filed
an
answer
to
that
complaint
in
1956
back
to
the
fact,
one
day
after
the
decision
of
the
district
court
judge
in
the
crumady
case.
in
which
he,
for
the
first
time,
brought
out
the
theory
of
bringing
into
play,
acting
primary
negligence
as
against
the
expressing
instructions
of
the
entire
bench
of
this
court
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case.
he
seemed
to
follow
that
--
the
decision
and
the
four
core
decision
that
there
was
a
difference
in
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
ship
contractor,
between
active
and
passive
negligence.
not
only
did
the
department
of
justice
in
arguing
the
weyerhaeuser
case
before
this
court
that
mr.
justice
clark
writing
for
this
court
pointed
out
that
judicial
administration
require
that
they
should
now,
in
the
area
of
contractual
relationship,
realize
and
directed
the
lower
court
in
the
new
trial,
not
to
consider
the
difference
between
passive,
active,
primary
and
secondary.
those
were
the
exact
words
of
the
court.
they're
not
the
exact
words
but
those
are
the
forewords
used.
those
are
the
forewords
used
by
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
that's
right.
and
we've
had
no
case
before
this
court
where
indemnity
has
been
allowed.
in
this
track
and
classic
case
where
there
was
not
a
contractual
relationship.
now,
let
us
start
with
the
allegations
of
the
petitioner
himself.
after
the
district
court's
opinion,
crumady
case,
there
was
an
amended
complaint
file
using
almost
the
exact
words
of
the
district
court
judge.
namely,
that
the
stevedore
had
brought
into
play
the
unseaworthy
condition.
nevertheless,
you
find
this
on
page
5
of
the
brief,
that
the
petitioner
himself
or
itself
had
so
placed
a
bag
at
the
bottom
of
hearsay's
as
has
been
called
the
vessel
to
be
unseaworthy
and
caused
the
vessel
in
and
off
itself
to
be
at
fault.
now
then,
would
that
fact
is
mind?
let
us
look
at
the
beginning
of
your
cases,
the
ryan
stevedoring
case.
we
will
go
back
the
halcyon
decision
later
because
it
deals
with
the
question
of
this
court
acting
upon
a
positive
statute
of
congress
that
seems
to
forbid
this
action,
notwithstanding
a
reference
to
the
decision
in
the
new
york
court
by
the
majority
opinion
in
crumady
case.
in
the
ryan
stevedoring
case,
ryan
was
held
responsible
for
the
improper
loading,
improper
stowage
of
the
cargo
at
the
port
of
origin.
ryan
was
not
held
as
he
had
a
general
contract
for
the
discharging
of
the
cargo
on
the
far
atlantic
coast
or
the
discharge
of
that
cargo
in
new
york.
this
court
bare
said
that
it
was
not
the
responsibility
of
the
ship
to
seek
out
cover
and
correct
the
improper
stowage
of
the
stevedore
at
the
port
of
origin,
that
is
namely
ryan.
that
is
the
basis
on
which
ryan
would
--
the
case
was
decided.
i
will
say
more
about
whether
the
bridging
of
(inaudible)
and
i
think
it
was
crossed
affirmatively
that
there
had
to
be
a
contract
in
the
ryan
case.
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
the
ship
did
not
have
the
correct
that
mistake.
in
this
case,
the
ship
neither
our
consignee
nor
did
our
stevedore
or
the
respondent
in
this
case
have
anything
to
do
directly,
indirectly,
legally
or
otherwise
with
the
improper
unseaworthy
stow
of
this
cargo.
and
that
is
the
allegation
in
the
petitioner's
pleading
as
to
why
it
paid
king,
the
longshoreman
because
it
was
absolute
liability
because
of
it
unseaworthy
condition
which
it
in
fact
brought
about
due
to
the
fact
that
we
could
not
discover,
if
you
please,
or
look
down
below,
if
you
please,
or
as
the
testimony
might
be
and
as
i
was
rather
embarrassed
because
the
testimony
of
the
speaking
of
proper
procedure
with
man
height
and
then
there's
a
question
of
how
many
inches
had
man
height
was
so
--
but
they
did
put
it
a
little
higher
than
i
am
tall.they
put
it
i
think
in
around
six
feet
or
five
feet
and
a
half.
but,
in
their
own
pleading,
they
alleged
of
an
underlying
cause
of
this
--
of
the
improper
placing
of
that
stowage
at
the
foot
of
that
tier
which
causes
to
collapse.
now,
the
circuit
court,
beside
from
the
question
of
the
joint
tortfeasor
case
part
that
it
indicated
great
(inaudible)
and
i
believe
as
we
did
--
your
honor
did
in
the
weyerhaeuser's
case
where
you
said
including
conduct
or
conducts
on
behalf
of
the
ship
which
was
construed
to
be
covered.
in
many
other
cases
in
the
brief
which
shows
that
where
two
wrong
doers
or
party
neither
may
recover
from
the
other.
and
i
don't
know
that
the
halcyon
decision
has
yet
been
overruled.
now,
we
will
start
with
the
halcyon
decision
to
say
that
the
halcyon
decision
was
concurred
in
by
every
member
of
this
court
as
it
was
now
seating
and
only
justice
burton
and
justice
reed
thought
that
it
should
been
divided
i
believe
and
that
is
the
way
the
halcyon
case
stood
and
then
it's
stood
today
to
be
the
law.
the
ryan
stevedoring
case
says,
and
mr.
burton
commented
to
the
minority
opinion
concurred
in
by
mr.
justice
--
mr.
--
the
chief
justice,
written
by
justice
black,
concurred
in
by
justice
douglas,
concurred
in
by
justice
clark,
says
that
this
was
purely
an
indirect
way
of
getting
around
the
longshoremen
and
harbor
workers
act
which
says
there
shall
not
be
a
recovery
against
anyone
and
so
that
there
will
be
no
misunderstanding
as
to
what
that
act
says.
i
will
just
take
one
second
that
if
no
one
should
recover
against
anyone
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
to
such
employer
at
law
or
(inaudible)
on
account
of
the
injury.
that
statute
has
not
been
repealed.
that
statute
was
in
effect
has
been
many
amendments
to
this
act
since
this
court
has
spoken
in
1952
and
there
is
no
reason
to
why
this
court
should
now
strike
down
that
statute.
what
did
you
say
in
the
ryan
case?
the
majority
opinion
for
and
for,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
concurring,
justice
harlan
will
made
the
fourth
member
of
the
court
to
make
the
majority
of
the
court.
this
--
this
is
a
case
based
upon
a
contract.
this
is
a
case
not
quasi-judicial
contracture.
this
is
a
case
the
same
as
a
bond
given
as
a
suretyship
and
carried
out
and
therefore,
the
exclusionary
effect
in
the
longshoreman
act
is
not
effective.
and
in
the
ryan
case,
insofar
as
this
is
was
once
clear,
that
the
stevedore
at
the
port
of
origin
is
the
one
who
failed
to
put
the
chart
under
that
rule
paper.
he's
raised
several
thousand
pounds,
that
he
failed
to
do
so
that
there
was
no
question
with
respect
to
any
responsibility
of
the
ship
other
than
the
stevedore
has
failed
to
do
what
the
stevedore
in
this
case
for
which
the
ship
is
liable
failed
to
do.
there
seem
to
be
clear
in
the
ryan
case
but
that
was
based
upon
a
breach
of
contractual
warranty
implied
by
law.
there
was
an
expressed
letter
written
by
the
ryan
stevedoring
company
to
do
all
the
stevedoring
work
in
this
--
this
concern
throughout
the
entire
atlantic
coast.
that
was
in
the
record
and
can
be
verified
by
the
record.
now,
we
go
to
the
next
case.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
that's
right.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
in
my
opinion,
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
no,
my
opinion
is
there
is
no
difference.
except
in
this
case,
the
shipowner
itself
employed
a
stevedore
down
at
the
port
of
origin.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
in
the
ryan
case,
the
stevedore
was
both
a
stevedore
at
the
port
of
loading
and
the
port
of
discharge.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
so
that
in
this
case,
this
ship
is
just
as
responsible
with
that
improper
stow
as
was
ryan
because
the
ship
itself
was
the
one
who
hired
that
stevedore.
they
didn't
hire
us.
they
didn't
pay
us.
we
had
nothing
to
do
directly
or
indirectly.
no
legal
responsibility
and
there
is
no
even
suggestion,
not
been
--
tell
us
suggestion
and
of
course,
did
not
obviously
been
made
because
it
would
be
totally
inaccurate.
now,
in
the
weyerhaeuser
case
again,
you
have
an
exact
situation
where
the
nacirema
steamship
--
nacirema
stevedoring
company
was
the
first
or
the
stevedore
placed
where
the
cargo
was
loaded
and
where
it
was
discharged.
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
stow.
and
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
basis
written
with
respect
to
active
and
negative
and
negative
and
passive
negative,
nevertheless,
this
court
in
weyerhaeuser
case,
written
by
mr.
justice
clark,
and
urged
in
the
briefs
by
the
department
of
justice
that
this
was
not
a
kind
of
a
case
where
courteous,
quasi
contractual
situations
enter
into
at
all.
it
is
not
a
case
where
active
and
passive
or
secondary
or
negligence
can
enter
into
at
all.
it
must
arise
from
and
be
out
of
the
contract.
this
court
made
it
clear
in
both
cases.
both
the
weyerhaeuser
case
and
the
ryan
case
that
the
relationship
between
stevedores
and
the
ship
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
responsibilities
to
the
injured
seaman.
that
was
another
thing
entirely.
and
that
that
relationship
arose
out
of
a
contractual
relationship
and
that
arise
out
of
any
other
kind
of
a
relationship.
now,
i've
heard
a
deal
with
respect
to
third-party
beneficiaries
under
the
crumady
case.
and
of
greatest
respect
to
the
majority
court,
i
refer
them
to
page
103
of
the
crumady
record,
and
i
read
it,
which
they
recite
terms,
conditions
of
a
contract,
dowries,
wages,
name
of
the
ship
weren't
to
be
discharged.
and
it
ends
up
insular
navigation
company
owner,
operator,
charter
and
agent,
then
it
was
signed
by
the
agent
of
every
one
of
those
form
on
behalf
of
every
one
of
those.
there
was
no
more
necessity
you
have
mentioned
in
third-party
beneficiary
at
the
crumady
case
than
there
was
to
readapt
your
document
because
it
has
not
been
over
less
than
a
year
ago
that
i
have
read
the
--
the
document
and
i
didn't
even
think
there
was
a
slightest
doubt
about
it.
there
wasn't.
the
ship
by
its
agents
was
a
party
to
that
contract.
the
contract
so
recites.
the
contract
gives
the
ship
certain
rights,
name
of
the
ship
does
everything
in
connection
with
it.
it
specifies
overtime.
it
specifies
rigging
time.
it
specifies
everything
the
ship
shall
do.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
i
proceed
--
i
read
the
opinion
as
proceeding
on
an
entirely
erroneous
theory.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
you
mean
in
the
--
in
our
present
case?
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
oh,
yes,
because
the
court
said
twice
in
its
opinion,
once
from
judge
maris'
proceeding
and
it
was
7
--
section
1.
he
said
an
admittedly
improper
as
the
stow
was
blocked,
admittedly
improper
as
the
stow
was.
in
both
of
their
opinion,
they
said
that.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
the
trial
court
--
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
if
it
was
a
sole
negligence
of
the
stevedore
and
this
was
not
a
piece
of
equipment
at
all,
nothing
that
we
were
doing
or
using
for
the
ship,
it
was
been
a
pure
volunteer
and
they
wouldn't
have
failed.
that's
the
reason
they
alleged,
that's
the
reason
they
stood
on
that
basis
and
that's
the
reason
they've
argued
on
that
basis.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
no.
i
disagree
with
--
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
--
you
entirely.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
i
disagree
with
you
entirely
because
the
record
says
that
if
the
ship
--
the
stevedore
is
solely
responsible.
and
the
ship
does
not
bends
on
shoreman
as
a
complete
defense
here.
so
i
don't
--
i
don't
follow
that
at
all.
i
mean
i
--
i
don't
think
that's
it
at
all.
no.
sieracki
was
on
a
defective
piece
of
equipment.
and
that
was
used
by
a
longshoreman
and
sieracki
then
put,
after
the
(inaudible)
case
way
back
in
1926,
put
the
--
a
laborer
at
that
time
in
the
same
category
in
giving
him
the
right
of
a
seaman.
then
sieracki
came
along.
now,
it's
--
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
in
the
crumady
case?
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
i
did.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
i
held
in
crumady
you
have
to
--
crumady
record
right
in
my
hands
on
page
--
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
--
97.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
page
97,
the
crumady
record.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
now,
that's
the
beginning
of
it.
now,
as
the
part
that
i
read
to
you
ends
on
page
103.
the
ryan
stevedoring
case
stands
with
a
very
principle
of
which
i
am
arguing
here
that
improper
stowage,
i
don't
care
whether
by
the
ship
or
by
the
ship
stevedore
who
he
has
employed,
properly
stowed
that
cargo
and
i
don't
have
to
use
my
words.
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
--
to
look
in
my
brief
and
you'll
find
the
exact
quotations
out
of
their
own
pleading
but
that
is
what
caused
the
unseaworthy
absolute
fault
of
it.
but
that
it
wouldn't
have
happened.
it
would
not
have
happened
had
we
explored
out
and
discovered
and
corrected
just
the
opposite
of
the
very
thing
that
you
said
the
mutual
obligation
of
the
ship
had
to
do
in
the
ryan
stevedoring
case.
the
majority
of
the
court
here
said
--
am
i
out
of
time?
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
thank
you.
it
gets
me
a
little
nervous.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
thank
you.
the
ryan
stevedoring
case
specifically
points
out
that
in
this
mutual
obligation,
when
do
they
have
it?
that
the
other
must
not
and
does
not
have
to
seek
out
and
correct
the
negligence
of
the
other.
that's
the
principle
of
the
ryan
stevedoring
case.and
i
respectfully
submit,
you
cannot
read
it
any
other
way.
and
i
respectfully
refer
you
to
note
6,
in
the
ryan
stevedoring
case
where,
and
that's
the
majority
opinion,
i'm
going
to
refer
to
minority
opinion
in
a
few
moments,
written
by
justice
black,
where
they
pointed
out
that
they
do
not
reach
the
exclusionary
effect
of
the
longshoreman's
act
and
they
cite
brown
and
crawford
decided
by
the
third
circuit
that
in
order
to
--
if
they
did
that,
they
were
circumventing
and
invading
in
doing
by
indirection
that
which
the
statute
positively
prevail.
now,
i
think
that
that
is
probably
more
forcibly
stated
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
minority
opinion
in
the
ryan
case
but
as
recently
quoted,
statement
came
out,
the
amount
of
the
oregon
district
court
while
they
followed
the
crumady
in
the
case,
there
are
some
observations
there
about
the
development
of
these
--
these
five
cases.
but
it
points
out
very
clearly
that
--
quoting
justice
black,
concurred
in
by
the
chief
justice,
justice
douglas
and
justice
clark.
liability
is
thus
imposed
because
of
the
negligence
of
the
employer's
other
employee
and
this,
the
act
forbids.
whether
called
common
law
indemnity,
contribution,
subrogation
or
any
other
names,
the
result
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
well,
they
ruled
against
you
but,
mr.
justice
black,
since
that
time
in
the
crumady
case
to
the
justice
that
is
justice
harlan
and
then
justice
frankfurter,
in
the
crumady
case
in
the
dissent,
that's
what
the
crumady
case
did
not
hold.
i
mean
the
--
the
ryan
case
did
not
hold,
what
is
stated
in
the
crumady
case
and
they
cite
both
the
ryan
case
and
the
weyerhaeuser's
case
for
that
proposition.
mr.
george
e.
beechwood
i
--
i
deduce
that
the
majority
opinion
in
the
ryan
case
held
that
there
could
be
no
recovery
unless
there
was
a
contractual
relationship
and
that
recovery
had
to
be
based
upon
that
contractual
relationship,
otherwise,
it
violated
the
exclusive
provisions
of
the
longshoreman's
act
which
says
no
recovery,
just
as
what.
now,
there
had
been
--
i
know
there
has
been
mentions
of
the
new
york
statute.
they
modeled
after
or
our
statute
being
modeled
after
the
new
york
statute.
it
so
happens
to
be
that
i
was
with
the
united
states
shipping
board
starting
in
1921,
right
--
several
years
after
world
war
i
and
remained
at
the
marine
insurance
profit
from
1926
and
we've
studied
this
very
statute.
and
i
may
say
that
models
may
seem
alike
in
all
respects
but
they're
not
always
alike.
and
that
is
true
in
this
case.
i,
therefore,
go
now
to
this
question
of
a
--
in
which
this
district
court
has
gone
to
extending
in
the
macpherson-buick
case.
i
personally
have
no
quarrel
with
the
crumady
decision
on
its
facts.
i
have
quarrel
upon
the
reasoning
of
macpherson
and
it's
pointed
in
this
provision
and
everything
else
and
the
tort
cases
and
if
you
follow
macpherson
to
its
full
extent,
cross
around
tort.
that
tort
against
to
whom
the
crime
or
injury
is
committed
would
be
the
longshoreman.
the
relationship
is
pointed
out
in
the
ryan
stevedoring
case,
was
not
on
tort
but
is
on
contract.
and
if
you
follow
the
reasoning
as
suggested
in
the
macpherson
case,
you
come
to
the
point
where
the
stevedore
himself
is
under
the
warrant
as
a
rank
direct
action
under
longshoreman's
act
against
the
employer
and
i
don't
believe
the
conscience
of
any
judge
could
sustain
that
position.
and
that
is
also
pointed
out
that
that
is
the
full
cycle
of
this
metamorphous
situation
in
which
we
have.
i
want
to
say
one
more
thing
with
respect
to
the
question
of
our
merchant
marine
and
american
merchant
marines
and
the
like.
we
have
foreign
ships
coming
in
here
far
more
than
ever
indicated
by
the
government.
and
you
all
are
familiar
with
the
(inaudible)
support
which
is
put
up
by
the
government,
all
available
to
you
if
you
look
at
it
very
clearly.
and
it's
referred
to
in
the
(inaudible)
citation
in
the
brief.
but
let
me
say
this
to
you.
the
economic
situation
of
our
american
merchant
marine
and
this
is
clear
in
those
reports,
as
if
everyone
of
our
competitors
are
operating
in
as
much
less
economical
posture.
yet,
it
is
now
being
suggested
that
we
can
have
inefficient
stowage
of
the
cargo.
we
can
have
malfunctioning
on
machinery.
we
can
have
everything
in
the
world
go
wrong
with
that
piece
of
machinery
in
that
ship.
and
when
it's
brought
to
our
american
port,
as
an
--
as
a
foreign
flagship
with
that
competitor
of
ours,
carrying
our
cargoes,
doing
everything
else
but
we
still
have
got
to
clear
it
out,
observe
and
correct
the
very
defects,
the
foreign
countries
are
paying
their
men,
75%
wages
less
than
ours
are
to
do
that
thing
and
then
we're
asked
to
do
it.
and
if
you'll
deduce
me
one
more
second,
there
are
two
kinds
of
an
insurance
in
these
matters.
one
is
protection
in
indemnity
that
has
been
all
the
time
carried
by
the
whole
that
is
the
ship.
that
is
for
the
protection
of
injured
employees,
seamen,
damage
appears
and
the
like.
that's
an
expense,
and
that's
an
expense
which
are
public
is
going
to
have
to
pay
for.
in
addition
to
that,
if
we
have
to
be
responsible
to
seek
out
and
discover
and
correct
the
negligence
of
people,
foreign
ships
who
are
ill-trained,
ill-paid
then
we
are
asking
to
be
paid
a
double
premium
to
our
public
because
our
people
also
have
got
to
take
out
insurance
that
protect
themselves.
and
i'm
not
going
to
say
anything
about
the
halcyon
case,
and
justice
black
in
the
halcyon
case,
pointed
so
clearly
and
repudiated
completely
the
argument
that
this
court
to
take
upon
itself
the
legislation
with
respect
to
joint
tortfeasors
in
this
type
of
case.
i
see
no
reason
for
me
to
say
anything
about
it
except
to
say
this
that
the
brief
had
served
upon
the
government
on
september
the
28th.
they
were
asked
which
department
it
was
whether
it
was
the
maritime
commission,
whether
it
was
the
secretary
of
defense,
whether
it
was
the
secretary
of
labor
or
whether
it
was
the
state
departments
or
the
executive
department
that
favored
this
court
to
legislate
in
a
manner
where
the
congress
has
already
legislated
and
just
stopped
short
of
the
question
and
it's
so
forcibly
based
by
the
majority
of
the
court
in
justice
black's
decision
in
halcyon
case.
therefore,
i
ask
your
honors
to
unanimously
affirm
the
court
below.
thank
you.
