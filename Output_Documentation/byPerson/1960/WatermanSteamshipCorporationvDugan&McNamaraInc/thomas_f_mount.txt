mr.
thomas
f.
mount
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
indemnification
or
recoupment
of
losses
by
a
steamship
owner
who
has
had
to
pay
damages
or
who
has
sustained
loss
because
of
the
personal
injury
to
a
longshoreman,
who
was
an
employee
of
an
independent
stevedoring
company.
the
facts
in
this
case
briefly
are
that
the
steamship
had
found
real
or
it's
in
the
port
of
philadelphia.
and
while
there,
he
was
unloading
a
cargo
of
sugar
in
bags
and
the
discharging
work
was
being
done
by
the
respondent
here
which
was
an
independent
stevedoring
contractor.
he
was
engaged
or
it
was
rather,
by
the
consignee
or
owner
of
the
cargo.
he
was
not
employed
by
the
vessel
owner
to
discharge
this
cargo.
while
the
cargo
was
being
discharged,
one
jasper
king,
one
of
the
longshoremen
was
injured.
briefly,
the
reason
for
his
injury
is
that
this
cargo
bags
was
stowed
from
forward
to
aft
in
the
whole
of
the
vessel,
from
the
forward
bulkhead
back
to
about
the
center
of
the
hatch
and
from
the
bottom
of
the
vessel
up
to
the
twin
dike.
in
other
words,
that
left
a
vertical
wall
all
the
way
across
the
ship
of
bags.
partly
in
the
hatch,
forward
part
and
the
rest
of
the
hatch,
the
lateral
half
of
the
hatch
was
opened.
this
vertical
wall
was
held
in
place
by
sufficient
shoring
and
support
so
that
it
didn't
fall
down.
when
the
stevedores
started
to
work,
they
started
in
the
portion
of
the
stow
which
was
at
the
top
of
the
hatch
and
they
started
to
take
these
bags
of
sugar
out
of
the
square
of
the
hatch
and
they
worked
forward.
and
as
they
did
this,
they
broke
down
the
stow,
a
distance
of
six
feet
or
more
in
height.
so
that
the
men,
when
they
were
working
in,
the
cargo
had
walls
of
cargo
around
them
of
higher
than
they
were.
and
the
testimony
in
the
case,
that
as
they
were
working
forward
in
this
hatch,
one
of
the
bags
was
not
centrally
placed
down
in
the
stow
so
that
the
weight
of
the
bag
on
top
was
without
support
or
some
bags
and
they
fell
down.
that
is
alleged
to
be
the
unseaworthy
condition
existing.
the
testimony
is
that
this
was
not
a
safe
and
proper
way
to
do
this
work,
that
they
should
not
have
broken
it
down
to
such
a
height.
they
should've
worked
it
out
frigidly
so
that
the
men
that
are
working
in
a
whole
which
was
higher
than
they
were
should
have
bags
not
so
high
above
them.
and
expert
testimony
was
had
and
said
that
this
was
not
safe
and
proper
way
of
doing
the
work.
but
anyhow
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
the
stevedore.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
sir.
well,
anyway
the
fellow
wasn't
hurt
too
awfully
bad
and
he
sued
the
ship
contending
unseaworthiness
and
unsafe
place
to
work
and
the
ship
paid
him
off
some
$6800
and
the
suit
had
already
been
brought.
the
ship
joined
in
the
stevedore
claiming
that
if
the
ship
is
held
liable
by
reason
of
any
acts
of
the
stevedore
that
it
claimed
indemnity
over.
and
so,
the
case
went
to
trial
on
the
issue
between
the
ship
and
the
stevedore.
it
being
contended
that
the
cargo
being
stowed
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
probably
unsafe
or
unseaworthy
and
that
the
stevedores,
in
the
manner
in
which
they
sought
to
unload
this
cargo,
stowed
as
it
was,
were
negligent
and
pursued
an
improper
procedure,
thereby,
bringing
into
play
the
unseaworthiness
for
cargo
which
caused
the
accident.
at
the
end
of
the
case,
the
trial
judge
directed
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
third-party
defendant,
the
stevedore,
on
the
ground
that
there
couldn't
be
any
recovery
or
recoupment
here
on
the
--
as
a
matter
of
law
because
there
was
no
contractual
privity
between
the
stevedore
and
the
owner
of
the
vessel.
and
that
is
the
question
which
is
now
submitted
to
this
court
for
decision.
the
court
of
appeals
first
heard
the
case
on
appeal
from
that
judgment
and
affirmed
it
per
curiam
opinion,
judge
--
chief
judge
biggs
dissenting.
then
a
reargument
was
had
and
then
came
the
decision
of
this
court
in
crumady
and
fisser.
at
that
time,
the
reargument
had
been
refused
but
on
our
petition,
the
court
permitted
us
out
of
time
to
ask
for
a
rehearing
in
the
light
of
crumady
and
fisser,
which
was
had
and
notwithstanding
crumady
and
fisser,
the
court
affirmed
the
decision.
and
the
argument
which
we
had
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
last
argument
was
what
then
the
decision
of
this
court
means
in
crumady
and
fisser,
that's
all.
we
had
seven
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals.
four
of
them
says,
it
means
one
thing,
the
three
say
the
other.
so,
we're
in
the
position
of
where
we're
asking
your
court
to
give
us
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
what
you
meant
in
crumady
and
fisser.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
--
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
well,
judge
forman
wasn't
on
it
the
first
time.
and
he
was
on
it
at
the
last
hearing.
he
was
in
favor
of
the
majority
on
--
on
the
last
opinion.
how
the
first
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
well,
judge
biggs
was
the
only
dissent
in
the
first
go-round.
it
was
--
the
first
opinion
was
filed
in
january
of
1959
which
was
the
per
curiam
opinion
with
judge
biggs
--
chief
judge
biggs
dissenting.
and
then
judge
hastie
wrote
the
last
opinion.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
no,
sir,
they
--
there
was.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
there
was
but
they
withdrew
it.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood.
they
withdrew
their
--
their
next
to
the
last
opinion.
and
the
last
opinion
appears
here
in
--
in
page
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
three
dissenters.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
(inaudible)
also
but
he
didn't
--
he
was
not
vocal
in
his
dissent.
judge
goodrich
added
a
little
help
along
the
line.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
now,
the
--
the
only
question
that
we
really
have
is
this
case
any
different
from
crumady
and
fisser
on
this
one
point.
do
you
have
to
have
contractual
privity
between
the
vessel
owner
and
his
contracting
stevedore
in
order
to
--
that
the
vessel
owner
may
get
indemnity
against
the
stevedore
if
the
stevedore
does
not
perform
his
work
in
a
safe
and
workmanlike
manner?
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
that's
correct,
sir.
and
that's
the
question.
do
we
have
to
have
it?
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
oh,
there
is.
on
this
a
contract
between
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
the
stevedore
and
consignee
and
we
say
that
under
--
under
crumady
and
fisser,
that
we
and
the
third-party
beneficiary
of
that
contract
because
it
was
--
the
part
of
that
contract
that
the
stevedore
gained
his
employment,
came
aboard
on
the
vessel,
made
his
money,
used
our
equipment
and
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
no,
if
the
court
please.
i'm
not
trying
to
get
a
third-party
beneficiary
out
of
a
contract
between
me
and
the
stevedore.
i'm
saying
that
i,
as
the
shipowner
and
the
third-party
beneficiary
of
a
contract
between
the
stevedore
and
the
owner
of
the
cargo
who
employed
him.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
sir.
i
don't
think
the
stipulation
closes
any
door
on
that
whatever.
frankly,
i
must
say
to
you
that
at
the
time
when
this
case
first
started
of
in
1954,
we
were
not
very
well
informed
as
to
what
course
these
various
ryan
case
and
--
and
weyerhaeuser
and
crumady
and
fisser
were
going
to
take
and
we
had
always
rather
assume
that
any
relationship
for
whereby
the
stevedore
came
aboard
was
tantamount
to
some
sort
of
a
contract.
but
now,
your
honors,
in
the
crumady
and
fisser
case,
as
i
read
it,
i
have
said
now,
it
does
make
any
difference.
is
--
here's
what
--
you
--
the
language
which
you
have
used
which
i
have
in
mind,
"we
think
this
case
is
governed
by
the
principle
announced
in
the
ryan
case.
the
warranty
which
a
stevedore
owes
when
he
goes
aboard
a
vessel
to
perform
services
is
plainly
for
the
benefit
of
the
vessel
whether
the
vessel
owners
are
parties
to
the
contract
or
not.
that
is
enough
to
bring
the
vessel
into
the
zone
of
modern
law
that
recognizes
rights
in
third-party
beneficiaries."
restatement,
law
of
contracts,
section
133.
moreover,
as
we
said
in
the
ryan
case,
"competency
and
safety
of
stowage
are
inescapable
elements
of
the
service
undertaken.
they
are
part
of
the
stevedore's
warranty
of
workmanlike
service
that
is
comparable
to
a
manufacturer's
warranty
of
the
soundness
of
its
manufactured
product."
now,
that
is,
as
i
say,
that
indicates
to
me
that
your
honors
are
--
have
recognized
in
this
particular
field
of
law
the
theory
of
third-party
beneficiary.
and
i
think
that
is
very
sound
and
i
think
that's
the
way
it
should
be.
we
must
take
in
to
account
the
realities
of
the
situation.
for
instance,
ships
are
run
particular
cargo
ships
have
businesses
carrying
cargo.
it's
just
as
important
that
the
cargo
be
put
in
to
the
ship
as
it
is
that
it'd
be
taken
out.
now,
the
ship
is
run
on
the
various
situations.
an
owner
is
not
always
trading
for
his
own
account.
he
may
have
his
vessel
out
on
a
years
time
charter.
that
time
charter
may
have
the
--
the
option
or
the
right
under
his
charge
to
serve
lent
to
somebody
else
for
three
months.
the
second
sub
charterer,
he
may
in
turn
choose
to
put
it
all
on
a
forged
charterer.
the
--
the
steam
shipowner
has
got
a
long
way
away
from
his
ship
by
then
but
it's
still
his
ship
and
he
is
responsible
for
what
goes
on
it.
so,
therefore,
it
seems
to
be
a
tough
proposition
to
put
through
a
shipowner
that
he
has
got
to
make
sure
that
he's
got
a
contract
with
every
stevedore
who
works
for
a
third
charterer
or
somebody
else,
somewhere
in
the
world
in
order
that
he
can
protect
himself
against
what
the
stevedore
does
far
had
been
making
damages.
and
that
just
doesn't
have
any
sense.
therefore,
it
shouldn't
be
that
the
shipowner
has
got
to
be
in
contractual
privity.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
thought
so,
sir.
and
i
thought
that
this
case
made
it
doubly
sure.
but
the
court
of
appeals
says
no.
it
says
you've
got
to
have
a
contract
between
the
two
parties.
there's
no
contract
here.
the
ship
and
the
receiver
of
the
cargo
are
strangers,
which
is
a
specular
thing
to
cite
because
it
must
be
realized
that
the
ship
is
a
business
of
carrying
cargo.
somebody
is
going
to
put
cargo
in.
somebody
has
got
to
put
it
in.
somebody
has
got
to
take
it
out.
that's
just
as
important
the
thing
as
having
a
sound
whole
and
every
shipowner
knows
that
somewhere
along
the
line,
somebody
is
going
to
take
it
out.
so
there
is
no
great
magic
in
saying
that
you
must
have
a
contract
between
the
stevedore
and
the
shipowner
where
it
has
an
interest
in
the
cargo
is
going
to
see
that
he
gets
out.
the
shipowner
knows
somebody
is
going
to
park
a
cargo
--
a
stevedore
and
very
quickly
where
you
have
a
charter.
each
one
(inaudible)
is
given
the
right
to
nominate
a
stevedore
even
though
in
some
instances,
the
ship
pays
the
--
the
stevedore
in
charge.
and
when
the
stevedore
comes
aboard
to
discharge
cargo
in
the
presence
of
the
master
and
with
his
knowledge
and
consent,
he
has
got
a
win
for
his
services.
if
who
ever
hires
him
don't
pay,
so
to
say
that
the
guy
like
that
is
a
strange
man
is
a
very
curious
idea.
he
certainly
isn't
a
trespasser.
and
we
all
know
that
stevedore
contractors
don't
go
walking
along
walls
looking
for
a
ship
where
he
thinks
he
can
slide
aboard
and
salvage
or
--
some
cargo
by
way
of
doing
stevedoring.
so
i
think
the
new
point
of
that
question
is
or
the
court
of
appeals
is
entirely
unrealistic.
now,
in
--
in
the
committee
in
fisser
case,
there
was
no
contract
between
the
shipowner
and
the
stevedore
if
the
contract
was
made
between
the
stevedore
and
the
charterers'
agent.
now,
there's
nothing
to
make
the
case
that's
charter.
charter
was
agent,
was
representing
the
ship
when
he
made
the
contract
for
the
stevedore.
obviously
he
was
representing
the
charterers.
but
there,
you
said
it
made
no
difference
so
we
take
you
at
word
on
that.
as
i
say
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
and
i
can't
see
no
difference
in
this
case.
the
only
--
the
only
difference
we
have
actually
is
that
you
got
the
contracts
for
--
with
the
stevedore
in
the
fisser
case
between
the
charterers'
agent
and
the
stevedore
in
this
case
it's
between
the
cargo
owner
and
the
stevedore.
so
that
whoever
makes
the
--
the
deal,
the
stevedore
is
going
to
come
on
board,
he's
going
to
do
the
same
thing.
he's
going
to
do
the
same
work.
he's
going
to
get
the
same
pay.
he's
going
to
use
our
ship.
he's
going
to
have
to
get
our
cooperation,
use
our
pertinencies
and
machinery
and
therefore,
he
--
when
he
gets
that
job,
he
is
coming
aboard
with
our
consent
for
his
benefit
and
for
ours.
and
i
think
in
that
situation,
judge
goodrich's
suggestion
that
that
sets
up
for
rather
unilateral
contractual
relationship.
in
other
words,
he
can't
come
aboard
without
our
consent
and
when
he
gets
the
job,
which
he
can
perform
on
our
vessel
and
he
comes
aboard
if
we
say,
"alright,
come
aboard",
that
in
effect
makes
a
contract
that
when
he
does
come
aboard,
he
warrants
that
he
will
do
his
work
in
the
safe
and
workmanlike
manner.
now,
i
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
i
didn't
hear
it
just
that
way
before
but
i
think
its
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
rather
well
court
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
that's
right
and
so
it
is
with
the
third-party
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
no,
sir.
i
don't,
sir.
i
think
in
the
circumstances
i
think
it's
very
realistic
as
i
have
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
pointed
out
before.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
well,
i
don't
think
so,
sir.
as
i
say
is
a
very
--
it's
a
--
it's
a
relationship
that
comes
into
being
that
is
highly
advantageous
to
both
parties,
absolutely
essential
to
the
ship.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
think
that's
the
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
that's
theory
of
the
thing
but
you
--
you
get
at
it
on
a
basis
of
the
fact
that
here,
you
got
a
ship
which
is
what
we
might
call
very
tender
when
it
comes
to
beings
--
casted
damages.
it's
got
to
be
seaworthy.
your
honors
have
said
that's
suspicious
of
liability
without
fault.
so,
therefore,
when
the
stevedore
comes
aboard
and
he
comes
on
board
to
his
work,
why
then
if
he
don't
--
if
he
does
something
that
makes
us
liable
then
he
hasn't
carried
out
his
agreement.
now,
i
think
that
the
third-party
beneficiary
in
those
circumstances
is
perfectly
sound.
so
i
argued
that
you
can't
have
a
third-party
beneficiary
if
the
third-party
beneficiary
don't
(inaudible)
but
i
say
that
isn't
true.
you
--
they
--
they
maybe
contracts
made
between
two
parties
that
may
have
some
effect
on
me
two
years
from
now.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
quite
agree,
sir.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
go
so
far
as
to
--
as
to
use
judge
goodrich's
theory
of
unilateral
contractual
relationship.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
that's
very
--
it
sounds
very
good.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
it
hasn't.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
--
no,
no
for
that
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
no
--
are
you
asking
me
a
question
about
the
record?
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
oh,
no.
i
don't
think
that
is
so.
i
think
that
the
record
shows
that
there
is
testimony
in
the
record.
let's
put
it
to
say
that
the
cargo
was
stowed
and
so
is
to
make
a
--
unseaworthy
condition.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
and
the
--
there
is
on
the
testimony
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
the
stevedore
were
--
was
performing
his
work,
did
it
in
such
a
--
a
challenge
in
such
a
matter
that
it
was
unsafe
to
do
it
in
the
way
he
did
it
so
that
he
left
his
--
all
the
cargo
without
protection,
his
good
fault
on
his
men.
and
more
particularly
was
he
at
fault
because
of
the
obvious
unseaworthy
condition
of
the
stow
so
that
in
--
this
falls
rightly
within
you're
right
year
in
the
weyerhaeuser
and
the
crumady
case
that
his
negligence
or
you
may
call
it
negligence,
it's
the
failure
to
carry
his
untracked
out
and
it
brings
into
play,
is
the
phrase
which
i
think
you
use,
the
unseaworthy
condition
of
the
vessel.
now
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
you
--
nothing
but
that
fault
situation
because
i
say
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
we
do
have
a
relationship
between
the
banks.
and
you
got
also
the
question
of
an
existing
condition
of
unseaworthiness
here
which
the
negligence
or
the
failure
to
do
or
the
failure
to
fall
properly
runs
into
play.
now,
if
you're
going
--
as
i
say,
the
--
the
basis
on
which
we
get
indemnity
through
the
ryan
and
weyerhaeuser
case
and
the
fisser
case
is
based
on
the
theory
of
a
third-party
beneficiary
contract,
none
the
contract
between
me
and
the
stevedore.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
well,
i'm
afraid,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
say
that
they
are
not
just
joint
tortfeasors.
you
have
answered
that
in
the
ryan
case
very
well
and
said
through
it,
you
may
call
it
negligence
but
in
fact,
it's
a
breach
of
contract.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
not
in
this
case,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
in
ryan
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
but
not
in
fisser.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
not
in
fisser.
and
you
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
went
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
into
the
fisser
case
much
further
than
you'd
gone
in
any
other
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
contract
was
where
an
agent
of
the
charterer,
not
the
owner,
agent
of
the
charterer
with
the
stevedore.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
so
he
might
have.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
but
still
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
it
doesn't
make
any
contract
between
the
owner
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
and
the
stevedore.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
well,
i
think,
your
honor
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
that
--
that
thing
has
been
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
posed.
that
same
question
you're
asking
has
been
posed
two
or
three
times.
and
i
think
your
honors
have
answered
it
very
clearly
in
--
in
the
ryan
case
and
also
in
weyerhaeuser.
that
same
question
was
said.
well,
they're
just
--
just
joint
tortfeasors,
therefore,
they
--
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
--
fall
on
halcyon
and
haenn
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
just
liability
without
fault.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
mount
i
think
so,
sir.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
