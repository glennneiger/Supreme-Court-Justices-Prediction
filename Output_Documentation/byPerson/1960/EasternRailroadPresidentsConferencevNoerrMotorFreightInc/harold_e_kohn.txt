mr.
harold
e.
kohn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
page
202
of
the
record
which
is
in
volume
4,
i
want
to
refer
briefly
to
the
way
in
which
many
of
the
these
articles
which
were
referred
to
by
the
court
were
tied
in
and
shown
to
have
emanated
from
the
defendants
here
even
though
there
is
nothing
in
the
article
that
would
give
anyone
the
slightest
inkling
that
that
was
the
fact
and
then
i
want
to
proceed
with
the
argument
as
i
planned
it.
for
example,
if
you
look
at
the
first
letter
which
appears
at
202,
exhibit
e148,
this
is
a
carl
byoir
interoffice
memorandum.
the
enclosed
(inaudible)
has
passed
the
board
of
census
on
er-tc
and
now
we
are
ready
to
decide
which
magazine
should
perpetrate
it
upon
the
defenseless
public.
cole
is
convinced
that
can
be
slicked
into
a
slick
mag,
advertisers
be
damned
since
it
really
doesn't
take
any
round
housewife
at
the
truckers.
i'm
inclined
to
agree
that
it
could
hit
a
good
general
circulation
magazine.
if
you
could
get
a
nimble
from
some
such,
i
could
i
think
convert
it
to
the
appropriate
style
or
get
sex
into
the
lead
or
whatever
is
needed.
but
then
you
get
paid
to
what
--
you
get
paid
to
worry
about
these
things,
so
i'll
accept
your
decision
then
you
can
convince
cole,
he
was
one
of
the
chiefs
on
the
byoir
account.
let's
look
at
the
next
one.
another
nomination
from
the
magazine
department
that
ace
ghost
writer,
james
miller,
from
one
slight
clipping
in
a
manner
toward
wisconsin
time
developed
a
1500
word-story,
â€˜history,
trucks
and
money'
which
appeared
in
the
april
issue
of
the
grange.
this
article
was
important
to
the
er-tc
course
because
it
reached
the
group
--
the
account
was
mostly
concerned
about
the
farmer.
then
the
next
arti
--
the
next
letter,
railroad
vice
president
mr.
petch
(ph)
of
the
pennsylvania,
this
happened
to
stumble
across
and
presented
to
milton
eisenhower,
then
the
president
of
the
pennsylvania
state
college.
the
article
i
think
is
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
pardon.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
it
was
the
--
what
--
you
knew
where
this
letter
goes
to.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
the
article.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
the
article
was
ghost
written
for
the
grange
by
the
railroads
who
paid
for
it
but
it
nowhere
know
that.
it
looks
like
it
emanated
from
somebody
who
was
a
member
of
grange
or
writers
grange
sympathizer
actually
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
oh
no,
no,
no.
this
letter
was
sent
with
a
copy
of
this
article
to
milton
eisenhower,
obviously
to
influence
his
opinion
as
if
it
emanated
from
somebody
who
was
totally
(inaudible).
the
article
that
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
referred
to,
i
think
in
the
buffalo
evening
news.
if
you
look
at
in
the
fourth
paragraph
of
that
article,
you'll
see
that
--
this
is
at
page
595
(b)
of
the
record.
you'll
see
reference
to
a
griffinhagen
report
to
the
citizens'
public
expenditure
survey
which
shows
certain
things
with
regard
to
trial.
that
survey
was
paid
for
by
the
railroads
through
byoir
who
arranged
it.
they
reactivated
--
this
was
--
was
a
dead
organization,
then
the
report
having
been
made,
they
circulated
to
all
the
newspapers
not
as
coming
from
the
railroads
but
its
coming
from
something
which
purports
to
be
an
independent
research
organization.
and
just
example,
the
other
day
when
the
--
the
radiant
heat
case
was
being
argued.
if
the
american
gas
association
had
been
able
to
setup
some
organization
called
the
consumers
research
--
the
consumers
investigation
division
and
had
paid
for
and
made
all
the
studies
and
then
sent
various
public
utilities
or
the
public
utility
commission
under
the
guise
of
being
independent
citizens
or
independent
research
organization
reports,
you
know
how
the
situation
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
should
say
first
that
that
would
have
to
be
a
different
case,
an
entirely
different
case.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
and
secondly,
i
think
that
if
the
railroad
did
this
all
over
their
own
name
for
the
purpose
as
this
court
found
of
putting
the
truckers
out
of
business
and
monopolizing
that
business
for
themselves,
then
that
would
have
been
in
our
opinion,
a
violation
of
antitrust
laws
for
two
reasons.
one,
this
material
was
highly
defamatory.
it
obviously
created
a
--
an
adverse
impression
not
only
in
the
minds
of
the
legislatures
but
the
minds
of
our
public,
the
minds
of
our
customers,
the
minds
of
anybody
else
to
whom
it
--
it
came
across.
so
that
i
think
for
that
reason,
it
would've
been
just
it
if
they
had
decided
to
organize
a
boycott
or
just
as
if
they'd
gone
to
a
lot
of
people
and
tell
them
not
to
do
a
business
with
it.
in
a
moment,
i'll
elude
to
the
fact
that
it's
a
word
that
i
struggle
with.
it's
one
of
--
one
of
the
new
word
that
i
don't
like
but
the
corporate
image
is
extremely
important
and
i
have
a
collection
of
essay
here
by
people
in
the
public
relations
and
advertising
department
who
point
out
that
your
public
image
is
very
important
in
selling
your
product.
the
customer
frequently
doesn't
realize
why
he
has
an
adverse
reaction
when
he
sees
you
or
when
he
sees
your
product
or
when
he
sees
your
service.
also,
the
--
these
public
relations
studies
indicate
that
the
public
image
of
the
industry
is
important
with
regard
to
every
man
in
the
industry.
so
i
say
sir,
first,
i
think
it's
just
as
if
they
set
out
to
boycott
the
trucks
even
if
they
publish
this
in
their
own
name.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
sir.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
think
the
source
is
--
as
this
court
said,
i
think
in
the
hazel-atlas
glass
case,
truth
needs
to
disguise.
everybody
is
influenced
by
the
source
of
the
material.
if
you
know
that
i
have
a
frankly
antagonistic
competitive
position,
you
weigh
differently
what
i
say
than
if
it
comes
from
an
ostensible
third
party
who
has
no
motive
whatsoever
and
no
acts
to
grind.
the
first
thing
they
ask
any
witness
in
any
case
is
who
is
he?
what's
his
bias?
what's
his
motive?
and
the
railroads
themselves,
i
mean
anybody
would
--
would
react
that
way.
and
time
again
we
see
throughout
all
of
the
legislator
patterns
of
congress
and
elsewhere
that
it's
important
in
matters
of
this
kind,
we
have
economic
struggle,
economic
content
to
--
to
reveal
who
is
the
source
of
the
information
just
yesterday.
in
the
new
york
--
i'll
come
back
sir
in
a
moment
if
i
may
continue
to
answer
your
question.
just
yesterday,
in
the
new
york
times,
in
the
matter
of
the
c&o,
the
chesapeake
&
ohio
acquisition
of
the
baltimore
and
ohio.
there
was
run
an
ad
in
which
they
stressed
that
standard
and
poor
had
run
and
a
study
which
indicated
that
it
was
a
good
idea
for
b&o
share
owners
to
accept
the
c&o
offer.
it
starts
out,
standard
and
poor
recommends.
now,
that's
of
a
great
deal
of
weight
because
people
think
that
standard
and
poor,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
they
are
completely
independent
of
c&o
so
that
you
can
really
say
that
this
is
what
an
independent
third
party
statute.
now
suppose
that
it
were
found
out
that
c&o
had
been
paid
by
stand
--
or
standard
and
poor
had
been
paid
by
c&o.
or
suppose
we
found
that
c&o
had
actually
written
this
through
some
public
relations
counsel
and
planted
it
with
standard
and
poor.
obviously,
it's
not
worth
what
its
worth
if
it
really
emanates
from
standard
and
poor.
so
i
think
sir
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
once
again
sir,
i
think
we're
now
--
one
removed
or
actually
two
removed
from
our
case.in
other
words
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
it
(voice
overlap)
it's
coming
out
as
i
assume,
mr.
justice
harlan
says
in
the
name
of
the
railroad.
secondly,
it's
--
it's
all
true.
that's
obviously
in
my
opinion,
a
much
more
difficult
case
but
it's
not
this
case
as
i
show
from
the
finding.
my
own
opinion
is
actually,
that
under
the
sherman
act
which
says
that
every
combination
only
subject
to
the
rule
of
reason
which
were
decided
--
which
was
passed
out
incidentally
in
two
cases
which
held
the
particular
conspiracy
to
be
unreasonable.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
(inaudible)
--
every
conspiracy
for
the
purpose
of
monopolizing
or
putting
somebody
out
of
business
even
though
it
uses
means
which
are
not
otherwise
illegal.
as
these
people
say
themselves
in
their
brief,
the
test
of
what
is
illegal
under
the
sherman
act
is
found
in
the
sherman
act
itself
and
you
don't
need
to
go
to
another
act
and
find
if
something
is
illegal
under
that
other
act.
so
that
i
think
even
there,
if
the
purpose
was
shown
as
it
was
here
out
of
their
own
mouth
and
incidentally,
this
is
not
just
a
documentary
case,
we
have
thousands
of
pages
of
testimony
and
a
lot
of
these
came
out
of
the
mouth
of
witnesses
called
by
us
for
cross-examination,
witness
after
witness,
each
putting
in
his
little
piece
that
made
the
entire
mosaic.
i'd
say
in
that
case,
if
they
prove
--
if
we
could
prove
the
intent
and
obviously,
it
would
be
much
more
difficult
to
prove
the
intent
in
that
case.
then
i
think
too,
you
would
have
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
where
the
purpose
was
as
it
was
undoubtedly
proved
here
to
make
trucking
more
expensive.
so
that
people
who
now
are
willing
to
pay
a
certain
additional
expense
for
flexibility,
would
be
unwilling
to
pay
that
additional
expense
and
would
comeback
to
the
railroad.
i'd
say
that
you
would
have
had
a
conspiracy
regardless
of
the
means
carried
out
for
making
a
competitors
business
more
costly,
more
expensive
and
thereby
taking
people
--
compelling
people
really
who
wanted
to
do
business
with
them,
to
stop
doing
business
with
them
because
it's
too
expensive
for
them
to
do
so.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
that's
--
that's
a
rather
long-winded
answer
to
your
question,
sir
but
i
think
it's
a
difficult
question
as
i
say
removed
from
this
case.
if
i
wanted,
i
have
a
relevantly
complete
answer.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no,
as
i
say
--
as
you
say
sir,
once
again,
it's
removed.
i
think
that
if
congress
would
say
--
assuming
for
other
reasons
it's
constitutional
which
i
think
it's
not
now,
i'll
tell
you
why
in
a
moment.
if
congress
should
do
that
then
i
think
congress
pro
tanto
would've
amended,
repealed
or
done
something
to
the
sherman
act
so
you
wouldn't
have
the
sherman
act
problem.
in
other
words,
congress
can
say
that
a
certain
business
is
--
we'll
assume
constitutionally
for
the
moment.
it
can
say
that
a
certain
business
is
illegal.
now,
if
that's
all
that
happen,
they
would
be
saying
the
trucking
is
no
longer
under
the
protection
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
as
long
as
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
i
think
if
congress
does
it
as
we
think
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
oh
i
see.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
and
they
do
it
openly
in
their
own
name
and
they
only
state
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
i
think
that
the
matter
of
pressing
legislation
and
free
speech
and
all
that
sort
of
things,
comes
into
this
case
if
it
comes
in
at
--
at
all,
only
as
a
constitutional
right
which
makes
a
part
of
the
sherman
act
really
unconstitutional.
i
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
protects
the
right
by
falsification
to
obtain
legislation
anymore
than
there's
anything
in
the
constitution
which
protects
you
from
being
prosecuted
for
libel
which
is
also
a
speech
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
--
by
which
protects
you
from
obscenity,
assuming
it
be
determined
that
it
is
obscenity.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
just
that
--
well,
it
depends
upon
who
is
doing
it
and
why
he
is
doing
it,
sir.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
just
the
other
day,
i
think
it
was
senator
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
senator
dodd.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
on
a
radio
program,
i
--
i'll
have
it
--
well,
i
guess
its
right
in
front
of
me.
senator
dodd
on
a
radio
program
just
november
23rd
said,
"if
we
are
to
preserve
this
precious
right
of
petition,
it
seems
to
me
that
any
legislature
were
--
legislator
weren't
dissolved.
but
i
want
to
know
who
is
behind
the
petition
before
it
gets
any
weight.
to
establish
what's
in
my
mind,
let
me
cite
this
kind
of
comparison.
suppose
the
petroleum
industry
organized
a
petition
asking
congress
to
pass
certain
legislation
which
really
would
benefit
them
greatly
at
the
expense
of
other
elements
for
our
society.
don't
you
think
it
would
be
important
to
me
as
united
states
senator
to
know
that
the
big
oil
companies
were
behind
this
and
it's
their
employees
and
people
who
own
stock
in
their
companies
got
other
people
to
sign
it?
well
i
think
so
and
i
think
that
any
petition
involved
in
it,
the
obligation
to
any
petition
has
involved
in
it.
the
obligation
to
make
people
who
wrote
it,
who's
behind
it,
who
got
it
signed
or
asked
people
to
sign
it.
so
i
think
that
is
a
--
a
very
important
element
which
cannot
be
divorced
from
this
case
before
we
get
onto
a
case
which
may
sometimes
come
before
you
where
you
have
a
pure
legislative
campaign
honestly
and
openly
putting
forth
only
truth
to
an
appropriate
legislative
body.
but
as
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
made
clear,
you
do
not
have
such
a
legislative
campaign
in
this
case.
you
--
first
of
all,
quite
clearly
have
a
public
relations
campaign
which
was
intended
to
injure
us
in
every
possible
and
conceivable
way
whether
or
not
there'd
be
legislation.
i'll
read
that
finding
to
you
tomorrow
morning.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
the
public
relations
counsel
is
definitely
part
of
the
american
way
of
life
but
he
must
conduct
himself
like
an
american,
open.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
thank
you,
sir.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
should
like
this
morning
to
refer
your
honors
to
several
specific
places
in
the
record
where
i
think
there
are
contained
findings
of
fact
which
pretty
clearly
established
what
this
particular
case
is
about.
first
in
volume
4
of
the
transcript
of
the
record
as
you
all
kindly
turn
to
page
88,
you
will
see
about
two
thirds
of
the
way
down
a
portion
of
the
opinion
of
the
district
court.
i
might
say
incidentally
that
the
district
court
states
and
that
in
addition
to
the
findings
of
fact,
which
it
makes
specifically
that
the
findings
and
the
statements
contained
in
its
opinion,
are
to
be
treated
as
findings.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn

88,
sir.
beginning
with
the
italicized
portion,
it
was
the
purpose
and
intent
of
messrs,

on
the
other
to
hurt
the

in
every
way
possible
even
though
they
secured

it
was
their
purpose
to
restrict
the
activities
of
the
truckers
in
the
long-haul

to
the
greatest
extent
possible
and
finally,

possible,

out

you'll
turn

or

(inaudible)
before

the
court
states
in
the
first
whole
paragraph
on
that
page
beginning
about
halfway
down,
it
was
a
matter
of
first
impression
with
the
court
upon
the
original
reading
of
the
complaint
when
this
suit
was
instituted
some
four
and
half
years
ago
that
the
charges
made
were
rather
incredible
nature
and
that
plaintiffs
herein
will
have
the
most
difficult
test
to
establish
their
contentions
by
a
fair
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
it
is
now
apparent
that
with
the
exception
of
proving
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
actual
bribery
of
public
officials
and
bribery
of
officers
of
public
organization,
the
plaintiffs
approved
by
a
great
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
a
conspiracy
in
violation
of
the
sherman
and
clayton
antitrust
acts
actually
existed
its
formation,
its
purpose,
and
the
means
by
which
it
was
affected
and
generally
in
the
form
and
manner
as
alleged
in
the
complaint,
and
i
will
refer
to
the
complaint
just
a
moment
or
two.
at
page
101,
the
last
paragraph
beginning
on
that
page,
the
court
has
found
as
a
fact
that
the
railroads
in
byoir
entered
into
a
conspiracy
and
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade,
the
nature
and
purpose
of
which
was
to
injure
the
truckers
and
their
competitive
position
in
the
long-haul
freight
industry
in
the
northeastern
section
of
the
united
states.
this
of
course
involves
interstate
commerce.
the
immediate
purpose
was
to
create
public
resentment
to
the
truckers,
not
only
in
the
minds
of
the
general
public,
but
in
the
minds
of
those
who
utilize
the
service
of
the
trucks
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
interfere
with
business
relations
between
shippers
and
truckers.
then
finally,
at
the
bottom
of
page
102
the
sentence
beginning
about
five
lines
from
the
bottom
instead,
"instead
of
meeting
the
competition
in
the
field
in
giving
the
shippers
what
the
shippers
wanted
they,"
that's
the
defendants,
"determined
upon
another
course
of
action
to
injure
and/or
destroy
the
truckers
and
thereby
force
the
shippers
to
their
detriment
to
continue
to
use
the
railroads."
now,
if
you
could
please
turn
back
to
page
six
but
i
want
to
show
you
one
or
two
paragraphs
of
the
complaint
which
make
it
quite
clear
that
throughout
this
case
and
not
only
as
episode
at
the
end
was
the
problem
of
our
suppliers,
shippers,
customers
and
so
on
in
this
case.
on
page
6
of
the
same
volume
of
the
record
to
which
i
have
previously
eluded,
you
will
see
under
subheading
e
of
paragraph
16
among
the
things
that
we
complained
that
they
were
doing.
vilification
and
defamation
of
the
plaintiffs
by
the
circulation
to
the
public
generally,
to
public
officials
and
to

and
customers
of
the
plaintiffs
are
false
and
malicious
reports
of
and
concerning
the
plaintiffs
in
their
business
of
hauling
freight.
and
there
were
one
or
two
other
places
where
the
same
thing
appeared,
which
i
don't
think
i
referred
to
you
in
reading.
and
then
finally,
on
the

themselves,
the
specific

if
you'll
turn

now,
finally
on
page
29,
number
31,
as
part
of
their
campaign,
defendant's
vilified
long-haul
truckers
as
five
percenters.
now,
you
remember
that
at
or
about
the
time
that
this
campaign
was
going
on,
there
were
legislative
investigations
with
regard
to
so-called
influence
on
congressional
and
other
governmental
agencies
here
in
washington.
and
the
term
five
percenter
had
come
in
to
popular
acceptance
as
a
term
of
odium
at
that
time.
now,
they
applied
that
term
and
their
own
interoffice
memoranda
indicate
that
this
was
done
deliberately
and
for
the
purpose
of
associating
with
us
and
having
carry
over
to
the
truckers
who
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
legislative
investigation,
then
going
on
underway
or
the
practice
of
it
--
in
it.
the
same
term
of
public
disrepute,
five
percenters
and
the
reason
was
their
justification
among
themselves
was
that
5%
of
the
trucking
industry
was
composed
of
the
long-haul
truckers.
and
that
court
continues
which
connoted
fixers
and
characterized
truck
operators
as
evil,
sinister,
wrongdoers
and
villains
and
all
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that
sir
is
page
29,
finding
number
31.
now,
these
findings
are
not
only
based
on
what
you
saw
by
way
of
magazine
material
in
--
in
volume
3.
in
addition
to
that,
there
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
other
written
material.
they
were
literally
thousands
of
pages,
as
my
recollection,
of
testimony
by
people
on
the
stand,
their
people
whom
we
called
for
cross-examination
as
a
result
of
which
a
good
bit
of
this
material
was
developed.
for
example,
they
send
people
around
regularly
speaking
to
all
sorts
of
service
organizations.
by
that
i
mean
the
rotary,
kiwanis
and
lions
and
so
on
which
are
composed
of
businessmen
who
are
natural
customers
of
the
truckers.
and
these
people
testified
on
the
stand
or
those
who
sent
them
around
testified
as
to
the
nature
of
a
lot
of
other
material
other
than
these
magazine
articles.
everything
in
these
magazine
articles
before
any
particular
article
was
admitted
into
evidence
was
identified
by
a
witness
on
the
stand,
either
that
he
orally
told
what
the
connection
was
of
byoir
and
the
railroads
from
the
witness
stand
or
there
was
a
memorandum
which
he
identified
from
his
file
which
tied
every
one
of
these
things
in
--
with
the
railroads
and
byoir.
now,
these
findings
were
all
sustained
by
the
court
of
appeals.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
no
issue
was
even
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
they
were
correct.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
too,
i
think,
it's
clear
from
the
record
here,
and
i've
gone
over
the
questions
presented
two
or
three
times
both
in
the
brief
and
in
the
original
petition
for
certiorari
here,
that
they're
not
challenged,
they're
not
raised
in
the
questions
involved
or
the
questions
presented
to
this
court.
and
those
are
the
findings
which
are
established
the
facts
for
this
particular
case.
now,
we
think
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
sherman
act
applies
to
or
covers
a
legislative
campaign,
although
i
indicated
yesterday
and
i
will
later
today
that
i
think
it
does.
but
whether
a
conspiracy
by
the
defendants
to
drive
the
plaintiffs
out
of
a
very
important
and
vital
segment
of
interstate
commerce,
namely,
long-haul
trucking
and
to
monopolize
it
for
themselves
utilizing
what
judge
clary
called
the
"technique
of
the
big
lie,"
in
which
they
actively
misrepresent
and
deceive
people
as
to
their
role
in
this
campaign,
where
they
seek
to
destroy
the
plaintiff's
goodwill
to
alienate
its
customers
is
removed
from
the
sherman
act
merely
because
the
defendants
also
sought
to
achieve
their
purpose
by
procuring
restrictive
legislation.
the
legislation
i
may
say,
not
at
the
congressional
level
but
at
the
state
level
and
that
is
of
some
importance
here,
in
order
to
increase
the
plaintiffs'
expenses
of
doing
business
and
the
price
of
their
service
to
the
public.
now,
the
fact
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
i
think
he
may
have
so
stated
but
i
think
if
he
did,
it
was
incorrect
then
i
--
i
was
going
to
come
a
few
moments
later
to
some
of
the
misrepresentation.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
now,
there
are
number
of
cases
which
we
cite
at
page
16
and
17
of
our
brief.
and
at
page
2
of
our
very
short,
supplemental
brief,
which
hold
that
even
if
the
main
thrust
of
a
conspiracy
is
to
achieve
monopoly
or
restriction
by
legislation.
but
that
does
not
prevent
it
being
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
act.
and
this
is
what
mr.
justice
harlan
mentioned
i
think
asked
about
yesterday.
in
the
sisal
sales
corporation
case
at
274
us
268,
practically
the
sole
method
whereby
they
sought
to
achieve
their
purpose
was
by
legislation.
and
this
court,
i
think,
then
speaking
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
mr.
justice
mcreynolds
had
no
trouble
whatsoever
in
concluding
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
act.
there
are
number
of
other
cases,
many
in
the
lower
courts,
which
hold
the
same
thing
on
page
17,
the
basing
page
of
the
brief
to
which
i
just
referred
you.
there
are
number
of
cases
in
many
circumstances,
there's
been
one
as
a
matter
of
fact,
which
was
tried
at
some
length
and
went
to
a
great
many
procedure
of
step
right
here
in
the
district
of
columbia
where
a
jury,
just
quite
recently
after
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
that
the
complaint
very
much
like
our
complaints
stated
the
course
of
action,
where
the
jury
found
for
the
plaintiffs
and
held
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
there
are
cases
in
the
seventh
circuit.
there
are
cases,
a
matter
of
fact
one
instituted
by
the
united
states
government
itself
and
the
association
of
american
railroad's
case
in
the
district
of
nebraska,
1945.
your
honors
are
familiar
with
the
maryland
and
virginia
milk
producers
case
where
one,
incidentally
out
of
the
allegation,
was
that
the
defendants
in
that
case
were
doing
just
what
was
sought
to
be
done
here.
that
case
was
disposed
off
by
a
consent
decree,
i
think
approved
by
judge
holtzoff,
just
a
few
weeks
ago
in
which
one
of
the
things
that
the
defendants
were
enjoined
from
doing
was
engaging
or
employing
any
person
to
present
in
his
own
or
as
any
persons
other
than
defendants,
the
views
of
defendants
concerning
the
enactment,
amendment,
repeal
or
rescission
of
any
legislation
or
regulation
affecting
the
defendant
or
from
remunerating
any
person
who
without
disclosing,
either
that
he
is
presenting
the
views
of
defendant
or
that
he
is
being
remunerated
by
the
defendant,
makes
representations
to
a
legislative
or
regulatory
body
or
who
would
be
expressed
or
implied
direction
or
requested
defendant
makes
representations
to
any
organization
or
association
without
making
either
such
disclosure.
i
think
it
was
mr.
winston
for
the
government
the
other
day
just
before
your
court
sited
the
united
states
versus
borden
case
as
a
type
of
situation
where
the
use
of
governmental
or
legislative
regulation
does
constitute
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
where
the
purpose
is
to
drive
somebody
else
out
of
business
or
to
monopolize
a
field
of
interstate
commerce.
now,
the
background
of
the
act,
i
think
it
was
to
examine,
indicates
the
same
thing.
i
think
mr.
justice
black
in
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case
pointed
out
that
an
organization,
i
think
which
was
called
the
"wheel"
was
started
by
the
farmers
and
people
of
that
day
because
the
trust
and
this
was
an
antitrust
case,
not
only
were
exercising
economic
power
but
they're
exercising
political
power.
they
were
influencing
the
legislatures
to
the
detriment
of
the
people
who
had
to
be
protected
by
the
legislation
which
was
enacted
in
1890.
i
think
that
fact
that
this
court
has
been
mindful
of
the
prevalence
of
legislative
attempts
to
achieve
monopoly
as
further
indicated
by
the
socony-vacuum
case
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
opinion.
and
he
pointed
out
that
merely
because
you
achieved
your
purpose
to
legislation
does
not
exempt
you
from
the
antitrust
laws
and
cited
three
or
four
types
of
specific
exemption
which
congress
granted
when
it
wanted
to,
to
particular
industries
to
proceed
to
do
something
through
legislation
or
through
state
administrative
practices,
which
otherwise
would
have
been
prohibited
by
the
--
by
the
sherman
act.
you
had
a
somewhat
similar
situation.
for
example,
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
where
the
railroads
defended
on
the
ground
that,
"well,
we're
not
doing
anything
which
is
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
because
we
have
to
proceed
through
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
the
other
appropriate
regulatory
commissions
and
how
can
a
conspiracy
or
combination
by
us
to
get
rates
which
those
agencies
must
approve,
and
which
must
be
reasonable
because
they
wouldn't
be
approved
if
they
weren't
reasonable,
how
can
that
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act?"
and
the
court
held
that,
while
the
rates
maybe
perfectly
proper,
the
combination
to
eliminate
the
competition
and
to
seek
in
incombination
a
rate
free
from
the
free
play
of
competition
which
should
precede
the
rate
making
process
was
itself
a
violative
of
the
act.
and
in
those
instances,
i
say
where
congress
has
seemed
fit
to
grant
exemptions
to
the
sherman
act,
as
in
the
bullwinkle
act,
as
in
the
insurance
act
and
so
on.
congress
has
done
so,
but
it's
been
manifested
throughout,
from
the
very
beginning,
in
the
--
in
the
original
trans-missouri
railroad
cases,
which
were
among
the
first
cases
to
come
up
under
the
antitrust
acts
involving
the
railroad.
that
they
fully
con
--
contemplated,
that
regardless
of
the
means
if
you
sought
to
achieve
the
purpose
of
your
conspiracy,
if
your
purpose
was
to
monopolize
or
to
restrict
that
that
was
illegal.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think,
in
the
northern
securities
case,
very
clearly
went
into
this
problem
and
--
and
pointed
out
that,
in
that
case,
similar
to
the
case
that
we
have
here
where
the
state
of
new
jersey
had
purported
to
permit
the
creation
of
certain
trust
which
were
--
by
trust
i
mean
large
organizations
controlling
other
companies
and
so
on
which
were
illegal
under
the
sherman
act.
it
was
first
pointed
out
that
the
state
of
new
jersey,
such
as
here,
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
those
who
are
taking
advantage
of
its
liberal
and
corporation
laws
had
in
view
the
purpose
of
destroying
commerce
and
then
the
court
continued.
and
i
just
want
to
read
briefly
a
line
or
two
stating
that,
"no
device
invasion
of
the
provisions
of
the
antitrust
laws,
however
skillfully
such
device
may
have
been
contrived,
then
no
combination
by
whomsoever
form
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
supreme
law
of
the
land.
if
such
device
or
combination
by
its
operation
directly
restrains
commerce,
then
later
on
while
every
instrumentality
of
domestic
commerce
is
subject
to
state
control,
every
instrumentality
of
interstate
commerce
may
be
reached
and
controlled
by
national
authority,
so
far
to
compel
it
to
respect
the
rules
for
such
commerce
lawfully
established
by
congress.
no
corporate
person
can
excuse
the
departure
from
or
violation
of
that
rule
under
the
plea
that
that
which
it
has
done
or
omitted
to
be
done
is
permitted
or
not
for
--
forbidden
by
the
state
under
whose
authority
had
came
into
existence."
we
repeat
that
no
state
can
endow
any
of
its
corporations
or
any
combinations
of
its
citizens
with
authority
to
restrain
interstate
or
international
commerce.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
yes.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
may
i
say
so
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
is
true.
we
do
not
seek
here
to
invalidate
the
legislation
itself.
we
are
--
although
i
think,
as
a
result
of
your
decision
in
bibb
versus
navajo,
that
if
this
legislation
does
unreasonably
burden
commerce,
it
could
be
declared
unconstitutional.
there,
i
think
it
was,
you
declared
unconstitutional
state
statute
which
merely
required
the
certain
kind
of
mudguard
which
was
held
to
be
burden
so.
we
say
that
the
people
who
seek
to
combine
to
achieve
their
monopolistic
purpose
are
restrained
by
the
sherman
act
from
doing
so,
just
as
in
the
georgia
pennsylvania
case
or
in
any
of
the
many
cases,
borden
case
or
any
of
the
case
which
arise
under
this
principle.
the
rate
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
some
other
regulatory
bodies
fixes
is
perfectly
valid.
but
the
people
who
conspired
to
get
it
may
be
restrained
under
the
sherman
act.
just
recently,
you
had
another
coming
out
of
our
circuit.
the
rca
case
where
the
federal
communications
commission
held
that
the
transfer
of
a
particular
television
station
in
philadelphia
was
perfectly
proper
even
though
incidentally,
one
of
the
things
they're
supposed
to
consider
is
whether
there's
an
antitrust
violation.
and
this
court,
now
reversing
the
court
below
that
that
did
not
prevent
the
united
states
government
from
proceeding
under
the
antitrust
statute
to
penalize
the
persons
who
may
have
conspired
and
it
was
their
charged
did
conspire
to
get
that
station
and
that
station
transfer
approved
by
the
interstate
--
i
mean
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
they're
two
different
things.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
certainly
agree
with
what
--
what
you
say
about
the
law.
now,
if
i
may
turn
briefly
to
some
of
the
misrepresentations
which
occurred
in
this
play
--
in
this
case.
it
may
say
also
that
these
people
and
the
evidence
makes
it
clear
were
old
hands
of
this.
byoir
and
this
was
testified
to
as
part
of
the
evidence
on
the
case
below
had
been
the
subject
of
antitrust
suit
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
famous
a&t
case
where
many
of
the
same
things
took
placed.
the
testimony
was
and
this
is
testimony
on
the
case
that
they
have
very
slight
regard
to
the
antitrust
laws.
they're
sort
of
like
traffic
violation.
they're
not
really
serious.
i
think
he
said
that
the
government
shops
around
until
they
finally
get
a
court
that's
willing
to
convict
you.
the
railroads
themselves
had
been
through
the
same
problem.
the
willard
committee
of
the
united
states
senate
had
exposed
in
the
1940,
a
very
similar
type
of
campaign
in
other
areas
and
that
too
is
in
the
record
below,
in
which
they
had
done
much
the
same
practices
in
other
areas.
now
first
of
all
as
to
the
misrepresentations,
basically,
we
think
--
and
there's
one
real
type
of
misrepresentation
that
they
misrepresented
the
source
of
the
material.
who
was
paying
for,
who
was
sponsoring
and
who
was
behind
and
then
what
the
motives
were?
they
actually
created
organizations
which
had
no
other
purpose,
no
other
function
except
to
distribute
their
material
on
the
names
which
were
wholly
misleading
like
they
set
one
up
called
the
empire
state
transportation
lane.
they
reactivated
and
financed
a
lot
of
organization
to
which
had
been
dormant
like
the
new
jersey
automobile
owners.
and
the
new
jersey
automobile
owners
was
the
one
and
who
is
named
extensively
a
man
was
going
throughout
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
and
elsewhere
making
speeches
to
rotary,
kiwanis
and
so
on
about
the
damage
of
the
trucks
we're
doing.
they
used
existing
organizations
like
the
township
supervisors
in
pennsylvania.
and
i
think
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
yesterday,
where
they
published
in
the
name
of
the
township
supervisors
and
ad,
which
have
been
and
been
paid
for
by
the
township
superviders
--
supervisors
organization
would
have
been
a
plain
violation
of
the
pennsylvania
statutes
which
forbid
this
organization
to
use
its
money
for
any
of
such
purpose.
and
the
ad
was
placed,
composed,
run
everything
else
by
byoir
and
paid
for
by
the
railroads.
they
had
a
television
program
which
they
ran
in
the
name
of
the
grange,
where
once
again,
it
was
a
plain
violation
of
the
federal
communications
act
which
said
that
in
a
program
of
that
type
you
have
to
put
--
you
have
to
announce
who
the
real
sponsor
is,
who
is
the
advertiser,
or
who
is
the
sponsor
paying
for
the
program.
nowhere
that
it
appeared
to
the
railroads,
in
this
program
were
the
actual
sponsors
and
this
program
was
put
out
in
the
name
of
the
grange.
then,
there
were
more
specific
false
statements.
if
i
may
epitomize
the
--
the
subject
of
the
dispute
for
just
--
for
just
a
moment,
it's
settled
by
the
maryland
road
test,
i
don't
think
that
any
dispute
but
regardless
whether
it's
settled
by
the
maryland
road
test,
the
maryland
road
test
did
prove
this.
that
the
important
thing
is
not
what
the
weight
is
in
the
truck
altogether
but
how
much
weight
is
on
each
axle.
it's
like
a
man
on
snow
shoes,
200
pounds,
and
go
over
snow
but
a
50-pound
child,
just
wearing
a
child
on
shoes
will
--
will
fall
through.
the
important
thing
is,
what
it
is
the
load
on
each
axle
and
second
what
is
the
subsurface
of
the
road,
because
as
you've
seen,
sidewalks
subjected
only
the
ordinary
pedestrian
traffic
will
crack
if
the
subsurface
is
not
properly
prepared.
now,
they
represented
that
this
test
had
shown
that
the
overall
weight
was
the
important
thing
in
damaging
roads.
now,
this
was
particularly
important
in
pennsylvania
where
there
was
a
bill
pending
which
would
have
increased
the
weight
but
decrease
the
axle
load
limit
to
the
benefit
of
the
truckers,
to
the
benefit
of
the
public.
in
other
words,
the
truckers
could
have
carried
more
cheaply.
the
roads
would
have
been
subject
to
actually
to
less
damage
and
the
public
would
have
gotten
services
more
cheaply.
they
defeated
that
bill
by
misrepresentation
of
this
maryland
road
test
saying
that
it
had
shown
that
the
increased
weight
that
we
wanted
was
what
would
damage
the
road.
now
actually,
there
was
on
the
witness
stand
in
this
case,
a
former
secretary
of
highway
of
pennsylvania
who
had
transmitted
a
report
to
the
governor,
the
governor's
office
upon
which
great
reliance
was
placed
by
the
governor
and
be
telling
this
measure.
that
man
on
the
witness
stand
still
at
that
late
date
did
not
know
that
the
report
which
had
come
to
him
from
one
of
his
subordinates
had
been
prepared
and
written
word
for
word
by
byoir
people.
we
asked
him
several
times
and
he
said,
"well,
it
seems
to
have
the
style
of
my
subordinates
so
i
just
--
i
assumed,
i
--
i
felt
safe.
it
was
prepared
by
--
by
my
people
in
my
department."
and
it
was
admitted
on
the
record
and
there's
no
doubt
about
this
that
that
report
was
prepared
word
for
word
by
the
byoir
people
containing
this
sort
of
misrepresentation.
the
same
thing
was
done
with
a
federal
bureau
of
roads
film,
which
was
shown
in
the
courtroom.
we
showed
the
original
film
as
it
was
prepared
by
the
bureau
of
roads
and
then
we
showed
the
film
as
it
was
put
out
by
some
organization.
i've
forgotten
the
exact
name
of
it
which
put
this
out.
and
the
head
of
the
bureau
of
roads
was
in
the
courtroom
and
he
expressed
the
opinion
that
it
was
not
the
same
or
substantially
the
same
as
the
film
which
he
had
originally
edited.
they
prepared
televisions
scripts,
radio
scripts,
which
portrayed
all
truckers
as
--
i
think
their
phrase
was
relating
to
evil,
sinister,
wrongdoers.
they'd
cast
them
as
heavy
and
villain,
that
sort
of
thing.
they've
prepared
accident
pictures.
no
matter
how
a
truck
happened
to
be
in
an
accident,
whether
it
was
the
truck's
fault
or
anybody
else's
fault,
that
picture
was
kept
in
a
file
and
then
circulated
around
as
if
it
was
the
truck
that
was
responsible
for
every
one
of
these
accidents.
and
they
did
this
through
news
agencies,
syndicating
agencies
which
appeared
to
be
independent
news
agencies,
syndicating
agencies,
but
they're
actually
owned.
we
find
later
a
lock,
stock
empowered
by
byoir.
there
was
one
called
the
central
states
news
views.
first,
they
started
out
a
--
remember
the
text
yesterday.
if
you
look
at
page
559
(b)
of
volume
4,
they
have
a
young
lady
called
ms.
(inaudible)
of
1949.
and
right
below
her
is
a
road
all
smashed
up.
then
they
have
ms.
plunging
neckline.
they
showed
a
truck
which
is
bogged
down
on
a
muddy
road.
then
they
continue
that
sort
of
thing
through
561
(b)
where
byoir
has
distributed,
this
time
to
another
syndicate
called
sc
syndicate.
this
horrendous
series
of
pictures,
truck
terror
time
and
one
truck
accident
every
10
minutes
and
so
on.
and
pictures
of
automobile
--
truck
accidents
which
nobody
endeavored
to
prove
and
nobody
could
prove
in
any
of
instances
were
caused
by
the
trucks
and
which
gave
a
completely
misleading
picture
when
circulated
in
myth.
and
their
office
memoranda
indicated
that
they
circulated
literally
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands
of
pieces
of
materials
of
this
kind.
now,
if
i
have
just
a
word
about
the
scope
of
this
injunction.
i
would
call
your
attention
to
once
again
volume
4,
which
we
had
before.
first,
at
page
164,
at
the
bottom
of
that
page,
you
will
see
that
whatever
is
contained
in
this
injunction
had
application
only
if
two
facts
first
occur.
first,
the
only
thing
that's
prohibited
is
what
they
do
in
combination
or
conspiracy
and
secondly
for
the
purpose
of
driving
us,
as
driving
the
truckers
out
of
business
or
severely
restricting
truck
competition,
as
to
the
bottom
of
164,
the
top
of
165
of
volume
4
of
the
record.
then
you
see
that
the
court
even
went
further
at
166,
in
item
number
9
in
protecting
the
rights
of
the
plaintiffs
by
pointing
out
that
the
only
sponsoring
instigation
or
support
of
legislation,
which
was
prohibited,
was
that
where
--
or
rather
putting
it
the
other
way.
it
was
prohibited
unless
their
opposition
be
openly
and
publicly
made
in
the
name
of
the
defendants
or
any
of
them.
in
other
words,
if
they
came
out
and
stood
up
and
were
willing
to
be
counted,
would
give
their
names
then
they
could
ask
for
this
legislation.
if
they
didn't,
then
it
was
prohibited
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
finally
in
article
v,
roman
numeral
five
of
the
injunction
on
166,
the
court
said
that
they
can
ask
for
legislative,
administrative
or
other
governmental
benefits
for
themselves
in
any
manner
and
that
where
the
plaintiffs
were
asking
for
legislation.
they
could
oppose
such
legislation
by
appearing
before
the
legislative,
administrative
or
other
governmental
body.
so
the
only
thing
they're
prohibited
from
doing
so
far
as
legislation
is
concerned,
is
combining
to
put
it
out
of
business
by
seeking
legislation
in
this
so-called
third
party
technique
or
not
for
attribution
or
big
lie
manner,
everything
else
they
can
do
by
way
of
seeking
legislation.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well
this,
the
context
of
this
order
was
state
legislation.
i
think
that's
of
some
importance
sir
because
one
of
the
things
that
they
did
must
--
misrepresent
was
the
national
transportation
policy
of
congress
but
passing
that
for
the
moment.
the
court
said
that,
"yes,
if
they
are
combining
to
do
this
and
if
they
are
doing
it
for
the
purpose
of
putting
us
out
of
business,
then
they
can
seek
the
legislation
provided
they
don't
deceive
the
legislature
as
to
the
source
of
the
material
which
is
being
disseminated."
if
they
do
deceive
the
legislature,
then
they
can't
do
it.
if
they
are
deceiving
the
legislature
in
combination
and
for
the
purpose
of
putting
us
out
of
business.
in
other
words,
the
only
thing
prohibited
is
that
which
had
three
incidents.
one
is
in
combination,
two
to
monopolize,
and
three
by
deception.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
the
only
act
would
of
course
be
the
general
lobbying
acts,
which
in
united
states
versus
harris,
this
court
has
disdained.
it's
not
they
buy
or
maintained
that
it
wasn't
really
seeking
legislation,
that
it
wasn't
the
lobbyist,
that
it
--
its
role
was
not
in
connection
with
legislation
as
a
sort
of
dichotomy
in
their
thinking
i
think
throughout
here,
they
were
repeatedly
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well,
i
think
sir
the
scope
of
the
injunction
is
that
if
they
seek
state
legislation
and
they
satisfied
those
three
conditions,
then
they're
prohibited
from
seeking
it.
if
they
seek
legislation
only
for
themselves,
perfectly
alright,
they
can
do
it
any
way
they
want
in
combination
or
by
deception
or
any
other
methods.
but
if
they
seek
legislation
to
restrict
us,
that
is
to
impede
our
business,
then
if
it's
in
combination,
if
it's
for
the
purpose
of
putting
us
out
of
business,
and
if
it's
deceptive,
then
they
can't
do
it.
but
if
any
--
anyone
of
those
three
is
not
present,
they
can.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
much
of
it
i
think
is
sir,
yes.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
and
for
the
purpose
of
achieving
monopoly.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
and
--
that's
right
and
deceptively.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no
because
if
they
go
to
congress
sir,
that's
perfectly
alright
because
they're
then
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well
that's
a
different
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
intrastate
business?
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
oh
sure
they
can
do
that
because
that's
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
sherman
act.
in
other
words,
they
can
seek
intrastate
legislation
in
any
one
of
the
states.
they
can
seek
interstate
legislation
from
congress.
but
the
one
thing
they
can't
do
is
try
to
get
the
states
to
set
up
an
interstate
barrier
which
constitutes
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
when
they
are
doing
it
in
combination,
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
it
very
much
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
--
it's
very
much
like
other
legislation
which
other
people
for
other
improper
purposes
have
sought
to
achieve
and
this
court
declares
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
but
it
--
as
this
court
has
always
pointed
out,
it
is
vital
to
keep
alive
the
area
of
competition
to
avoid
the
initial
conspiracy
rather
than
to
try
thereafter
when
it's
achieved
its
purpose
to
endeavour
to
--
to
right
the
wrong
which
has
already
been
done.
it's
the
--
the
area
of
competition,
the
--
the
climate
of
competition
which
is
sort
to
be
preserved
and
actually
the
sherman
act
is
violated
when
the
people
initially
conspired.
this
court
has
declared
many
times,
i
think
most
recently
in
the
frankfurt
seagrams
(ph)
case
and
i
think
there
was
some
language
that
are
affecting
in
the
(inaudible)
case
that
every
means
that
you
may
use
to
achieve
the
unlawful
purpose
of
monopolizing
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
--
is
from
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
pardon?
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
there
were
certain
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no,
no,
i
wouldn't.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no,
sir.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
well
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
assuming
that.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
yes,
well,
i
think
if
you
assume
that,
then
of
course
the
answer
must
necessarily
follow.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
but
i
think
the
constitution
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
think
the
constitution
--
first
of
all,
if
i
may
say
sir,
with
all
due
deference
to
the
court
and
the
counsel
in
the
other
side.
this
is
not
in
the
questions
presented
at
all.
there
are
only
question
as
whether
the
sherman
act
prohibit
this
sort
of
thing
but
assume
you'll
get
pass
that
void
and
decide
even
though
it's
among
the
question
presented
and
was
never
raised
throughout
here
that
it
is
an
issue.
i
think
the
constitution
does
not
protect
and
this
is
our
case
here,
does
not
protect,
deceptive
means
of
communication.
you've
decided
in
the
harris
case
that
you
must
reveal
your
source.
in
the
hazel
atlas
glass
case
where
the
lawyers
for
the
parties
in
that
case
wrote
a
magazine
article,
very
much
as
here
and
put
it
out
in
the
name
of
a
union
instead
of
themselves.
the
court
held
that
that
is
not
protected.
but
i
think
the
phrase
was
there,
truth
needs
no
disguise
so
that
you
have
that
illustration
of
this
principle.
and
i
think
you
find
the
same
thing
in
many
other
cases
and
types
of
cases.
i
think
there
was
a
footnote
in
one
of
the
cases
where
there
was
a
dissent
with
regard
to
the
right
of
unions
to
make
political
contributions.
and
in
that
case,
even
the
dissenting
judges
who
opposed,
who
thought
unconstitutional,
had
a
footnote
saying
there's
no
question
that
you
could
require
the
unions
to
reveal
the
source
of
the
publications
which
they
put
out.
so
that
if
you
get
into
this
field
at
all,
i
think
you
have
an
area
where
the
constitution
does
not
protect
and
i
say
actually
in
the
context
of
this
case,
you
--
you
should
never
really
reach
that
issue
because
it
has
not
been
--
not
been
raised
here.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
now,
i
must
differ
with
you
slightly
on
that
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no,
i
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
now,
i
might
still
differ
with
you,
sir.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
what
i
thought
i
had
said
to
mr.
justice
black
was
that
in
an
intrastate
monopolies,
the
--
a
state
can
set
up
intrastate
monopolies
because
it's
not
prohibited
by
the
sherman
act.
now,
there
is,
and
this
was
clearly
brought
out
in
georgia
versus
pennsylvania,
that
even
though
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
governmental
action
would
not
be
unconstitutional
or
prohibited,
nevertheless,
the
combination
and
this
is
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no,
oh,
no,
i
think
it
went
further
than
that,
sir,
if
i
may
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
realized
that,
sir.
but
i
think
that
what
they
held
there
was
that
even
though
the
ultimate
rate
and
this
is
in
these
cases
from
the
very
beginning,
the
trans-missouri
cases
way
back
to
the
turn
of
the
century.
the
fact
that
you
seek
to
obtain,
that
which
would
be
perfectly
legal
when
obtained
in
conspiracy
makes
your
conspiracy,
nevertheless,
if
it's
to
restrict
commerce
or
to
monopolize
illegal.
and
you've
the
borden
case,
you
got
all
these
cases.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
oh
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
in
those
--
in
those
cases
sir,
all
of
the
arguments
were
raised
as
to
the
--
to
the
constitutional
objections
which
were
then
factual.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
no
i'm
talking
about
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
they
also
raised
a
question
that
this
law
has
interfered
with
freedom
of
contract.
they
impaired
contracts.
they
affected
the
reserve
powers
of
the
states
which
had
the
right
to
set
local
railroad
right.
there
were
--
there
were
all
those
issues
in
it.
may
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
i
don't
think
all
claims.
i
think
you've
got
to
examine
as
you
sir
yourself
have
said
so
many
times.
each
of
the
very
delicate
constitutional
problems
in
the
context
of
the
particular
situation,
you
said
so
just
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
the
gomillion
case.
it's
very
difficult
for
me
standing
here
to
answer
a
question
about
the
oil
and
margarine
butter
industry.
i
do
know
that
on
the
context
here
where
the
chief
purpose
was
to
put
us
out
of
business
and
one
of
the
incidental
purposes
was
by
getting
this
legislation
when
a
judge
says
that
they
wanted
to
put
it
us
out
of
business
by
this
material
whether
or
not
they
got
legislation
the
fact
it's
somewhat
different
problem.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
many
situations,
that
is
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
that's
right.
the
sisal
case
held
that
specific.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
but
it
was
still
achieving
a
purpose
by
legislation
which
the
particular
legislative
sovereignty
had
the
perfect
right
if
it
wanted
to
--
to
enact.
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
in
the
angle
case,
which
this
court
decided,
it
was
held
that
we're
in
an
ordinary
tort.
a
person
got
a
state
legislation
to
interfere
with
established
contractual
right
that
that
fact
he
--
he
got
it
through
legislation
and
sought
legislation
was
completely
immaterial.
it
was
still
a
tort
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
the
angle
case
sir.
it
cited
at
page
16
of
our
brief
angle,
it
was
instant
a
railroad
too,
versus
chicago,
saint
paul,
151
u.s.
1.
and
i
may
have
just
a
moment
sir
on
the
question
of
damages.
the
--
in
a
sense
the
business
of
the
pmta
is
--
is
to
defend
its
--
its
members
and
as
you
decided
in
the
international
news
ap
case
which
unfortunately
i
don't
cite
in
my
brief
at
248
u.s.
215.
in
a
situation
like
the
one
we
had
here
where
we
went
through
an
entire
case,
with
literally
tenths
of
free
trial
conferences
with
briefs
really
stacked
--
may
i
have
just
a
moment
--
mr.
harold
e.
kohn
almost
as
--
as
high
as
i
am
standing
here
where
this
issue
was
never
raised
until
after
the
question
of
liability
had
already
been
determined
by
the
court
and
it
appears
only
in
one
passing
fleeting
footnote
in
a
brief
file
thereafter
where
you
have
a
situation
like
that
with
a
stipulation
entered
into
with
all
the
parties
understanding
and
we
had
answered
interrogatory's
telling,
but
the
pmta
damage
was,
but
we
just
think
it's
--
it
comes
awful
light
in
the
day
and
for
all
practical
--
for
all
real
purposes
in
this
litigation,
it
was
waived.
judge
clary
doesn't
even
allude
to
it
because
that
defense
was
never
even
raised
before
judge
clary
until
out
this
litigation.
we
always
understood
that
the
cause
of
defending
against
this
antitrust
campaign
of
the
defendants
would
be
recoverable
insofar
as
those
damages
are
concerned
by
the
pennsylvania
motor
truck
association.
you
just
the
other
day
denied
certiorari
in
a
case
coming
out
of
our
circuit.
i
think
with
the
hanover
shoe
versus
another
shoe
company
where
an
antitrust
--
antitrust
case,
it
was
held
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
additional
costs
were
passed
along
to
the
customers
does
embark
the
person
who
initially
put
the
money
out
from
recovering
his
antitrust
damages,
so
that
we
do
say
that
that
issue
really
hasn't
been
raised
and
with
the
damages
awarded
should
be
allowed.
