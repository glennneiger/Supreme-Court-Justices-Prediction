you're
so
confident
that
this
wouldn't
reach
the

justice

i
was
going
to
ask,
mr.
price,
whether
in
this
long
--
in
this
fully
old
decree
with

--

whether
you

which
this
court
took
a
half
of
the
burden
which
trucks
cast
upon

in
passing
on
the
validity
of
imposing
great
cost
in
the
railroad.
justice

(voice

i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
decision

justice
felix

does
that
mean
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

if
i
understand
you
on
that
point
that
the
railroad
--
the
service
credited
in
the
legislative
eyes
of
the
state
candidly
did
this
instead
of
--
to
madison
avenue
that
the
problem
wouldn't
be
in
a
--
serious
to
you
as
this
one,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
makes
every,
every,
doesn't
it?
the
rule
of
reading
makes
every,
every,
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
applying
your
argument,
you
reject
the
notion
that
public
relations
counsel
is
part
of
the
american
way
of
life.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
court,
despite
the
commerce
clause,
regulates
the
way
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice

et
cetera,
which
is
a
very
different
situation
from
the
northern
securities
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
suggesting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
the
northern
securities
case
doesn't
help
us
from
the
slightest
with
this
problem,
because
jersey
couldn't
authorize
its
cooperation
to
enter
a
combination
which
by
--
the
sherman
law
because
that's
beyond
--
that
was
beyond
the
power
of
jersey,
with
a
combination
or
no
combination,
whether
spontaneously
generated
or
stimulated.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kohn,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
two
questions.
we're
in
an
area
here
where
the
state
has
power,
namely
the
regulation
of
the
trucking
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
speed,
weight,
length,
height,
etcetera.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
area
is
well
define
because
this
court
in
its
decision
has
frequently
had
often
does
not
--
more
often
than
not,
i
think,
divided
on
what
is
still
open
to
the
states
and
what
is
not
open.
so
that
my
first
question
is,
am
i
right
in
saying
that
whether
it
is
or
isn't
within
the
state
power
to
beget
such
legislation,
if
you
please
from
using
your
phrase,
conspiratorium,
meaning
combined
effort,
is
or
is
not
within
the
state
power
in
each
case,
the
court
would
first
have
to
decide
in
connection
with
the
sherman
law
case
whether
the
state
could
have
passed
or
could
pass
such
proposed
or
desired
legislation,
that
so
is
true,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
thought
you
just
said
to
--
to
justice
black
that
if
there
is
a
constitutional
power
on
the
part
of
the
state
to
beget
--
i'm
coming
to
your
deception
point
a
minute,
but
that's
the
one
side
further
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
there
is
constitutional
power
on
the
state
to
beget
such
legislation,
then
it
may
be
solicited
or
begotten
to
effort
as
all
legislation,
almost
all
legislation
is
to
outside
effort,
therefore,
in
each
case,
we
have
to
decide
whether
the
proposed
legislation
comes
within
the
reserve,
so-called
reserves
state
power
or
rest
impliedly,
exclusively
within
the
congressional
domain.

georgia
wasn't
constitutional.
georgia
was
the
question
of
whether
you
first
had
to
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
justice
felix

your
recollection,
you
probably

it

recently

constitutional.

the

precise
issue

not
with
deception,
you
take

take
the
long
run
during
legislation
against
oil
and
margarin.

constant
route
between
the
butter
and
this
dairy
and
just
the

margarine,
is
all
of
all
claims
as
to
the
nefariousness
of
the
unhealthy
or
mischievous
results
flowing
from
oil
or
margarine
are
almost
plain
and
subject
to
the
test
of
whether
the
deception

rivals
talk

coffee?

from

experience
here

try

experience,
have
then
intimate
knowledge
like
the
rest
of
us
nearly
as
observers
that
most
legislation
is
an
effort
to
put
somebody

out

mr.

which

that
the

it

one
phase

the

phase

with
it.

don't
