not
raised

this
appears
to
have
been
a
private
agreement
(inaudible)
justice
hugo

black
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
ask
you
one
that's
also
removed
from
it
but
not
totally
removed.
suppose
the
railroads
get
together
and
said,
we
want
to
put
these
truckers
out
of
business.
the
way
to
put
them
out
of
business
is
have
congress
pass
a
law
which
abolishes
to
appeal
certain
law,
takes
away
their
right
to
use
the
road.
they
--
that's
all
they
do.
they
write
letters
and
write
letters
and
write
letters
and
write
letters
to
congressmen
and
senators.
that's
all
they
ever
do
and
that's
what
they
agreed
to
do.
they
want
to
put
them
out
of
business
that
way.
would
that
violate
the
antitrust
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
want
to
put
them
under
a
law
that's
so
heavy,
they
just
can't
compete
with
the
(inaudible).
justice
hugo
l.
black
agreed
to
it
and
that's
what
they
are
doing.
they
only
means
by
which
they
proposed
to
accomplish
it,
is
by
writing
senators
and
congressmen.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
congress
doing
it.
let's
say
congress
didn't
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
to
do
it
and
they
write
these
letters.
it
only
means
they're
going
to
take
to
put
them
out
of
business
is
by
writing
letters
to
congress
--
congressmen
and
senators.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
care
what
--
would
--
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
they
did
it
openly
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
would
say
then
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
say
then
that
the
campaigning
that
we
had
a
few
years
ago
where
people
just
went
out
and
got
fictitious
names
and
sent
them
into
congress
and
so
forth
is
not
protected.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
does
it
because
he
wants
to
get
certain
legislation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
nice
question
but
it's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
almost
related
to
your
question
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that
you're
reading
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand,
you
read
that
as
you
named
it.
they
are
enjoined
from
asking
congress
for
past
legislation,
(inaudible)
past
legislation,
unless
they
put
--
put
their
names
to
the
request?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
act
of
congress
in
this
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
true
or
not,
i
--
i
was
asking
you
about
the
scope
of
the
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
large
part
of
the
legislation
(inaudible)
is
directed
--
directly
at
doing
an
injury
to
one
group
in
order
to
benefit
another
group?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
this
would
mean
that
these
people
enjoined
from
doing
that
as
they
combined
with
one
another,
both
of
them
want
to
accomplish
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
and
for
the
purpose
achieving
a
monopoly
by
reason
of
this
passage
of
a
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
supposed
they
were
trying
simply
to
create
a
monopoly
to
say
that,
"we
want
to
get
to
congress
to
pass
a
law
which
allows
the
railroads
to
do
all
the
transportation
business,"
would
they
be
enjoined
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
want
to
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
intrastate
business
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
was
the
factor
it
was
thought
to
create
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
to
have
if
it
was
created
an
unconstitutional
burden,
of
course,
of
this
court
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
set
aside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
say
that
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
that
there're
some
means
that
are
protected
by
the
constitution
to
do
things.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
wouldn't
claim
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
any
means
would
violate
the
constitutional
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
can
enjoin
that
even
if
there
was
conspiracy
to
be
used
in
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
a
business,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
--
assuming
now
that
the
means
that
being
used
if
one
that
the
constitution
protects
in
size
shall
be
guaranteed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
assuming
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then
you
get
down
to
that
question
here,
is
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you
at
one
in
the
beginning
about
