your
honors.
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
review
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
which
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
and
a
case
arising
under
the
sherman
act
which
was
tried
by
the
district
court
judge
without
a
jury,
pursuant
to
agreement
of
the
parties.
with
your
honors'
permission,
i
will
divide
the
argument,
present
the
opening
and
the
closing
portion
of
the
argument
will
be
presented
by
mr.
hugh
cox
following
that
presented
by
the
respondents.
this
case
was
a
private
sherman
act
case
for
treble
damages,
brought
by
40
long-haul
trucking
companies
and
their
trade
association,
the
pennsylvania
motor
truck
association
which
for
convenience
was
referred
to
throughout
this
trial
as
the
pmta.
against
some
23
railroads
and
a
--
an
association
of
their
presidents,
those
are
the
eastern
railroad
presidents
conference
by
its
initials,
the
ertc
and
byoir
incorporated,
a
public
relations
firm.
it
resulted
in
a
finding
for
the
plaintiff,
trucking
companies
by
the
court
of
damages
in
the
sum
of
18
cents
each.
a
fine
being
in
favor
of
the
trade
association
for
a
sum
of
$650,000,
the
allowance
of
counsel
fee
in
the
sum
of
$200,000
and
the
entry
of
a
restraining
order
in
the
form
of
a
decree
which
i
shall
describe
in
detail
presently.
this
case
involves
the
long-haul
trucking
industry
only.
the
long-haul
trucking
industry
operates
heavy
trucks,
large
trucks
which
have
extra
loads
of
an
excess
of
18,000
pounds,
gross
weights
in
excess
of
30,000
pounds.
and
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
refer
briefly
to
the
historical
background
which
led
up
to
this
suit
which
was
brought
incidentally
in
january
of
1953.
beginning
on
--
in
1930,
the
number
of
long-haul
large
trucks
was
relatively
small,
only
perhaps
28,000.
by
1950,
that
had
grown
to
450,000.
that
represented,
perhaps
1%
of
the
total
number
of
motor
vehicles
which
we
use
in
the
highways
of
the
united
states
in
that
year.
and
approximately
5%
of
those
that
were
classified
as
trucks,
so
that
it
was
a
relatively
small
number
of
vehicles
when
compared
with
the
total
number
that
we
use
in
the
highway.
as
those
trucks
grew
in
number,
they
likewise
grew
in
size
over
that
period
of
20
years.and
as
they
grow
in
size,
the
roads
had
to
be
increased
in
width.
the
grades
have
to
be
flattened,
the
foundations
have
to
be
made
much
more
firm
and
sound,
bridges
have
to
strengthened
and
so
on.
the
truckers
as
a
group
were
actively
engaged
in
lobbying
for
legislation
which
would
enable
them
to
carry
larger
weights,
larger
loads
in
their
trucks
and
to
operate
larger
trucks
themselves
because
in
the
early
days,
the
limitations
or
the
size
of
trucks
and
weight
of
trucks
was
very
hampering
to
the
carriage
of
large
volumes
of
freight.
as
the
weights
increased,
the
fees
did
not
increase
proportionately.
and
although
the
roads
cost
pretty
much
more
to
build
and
to
maintain,
the
relative
value
of
the
cost
to
the
trucking
industry
of
using
those
roads
which
constituted
their
own
right
of
way
and
which
gave
them
the
flexibility,
was
made
their
business
possible,
did
not
increase
proportionately.
and
because
of
the
reciprocity
provisions
of
state
laws,
whereby
a
truck
license
in
state
a
could
cause
all
other
states
free
of
additional
license
fees.
there
were
many
states
which
these
trucks
could
cause
cost
and
whose
roads
they
could
use
without
the
payment
of
any
fees
at
all.
a
conspicuous
illustration
with
the
state
of
oregon,
which
in
the
very
early
days
and
long
before
this
campaign
which
i
shall
describe
in
a
few
moments,
began,
imposed
a
fee
or
fees
on
long-haul
trucks
which
were
based
upon
two
factors,
their
weight,
the
weight
that
they
carry
and
the
distance
that
they
carry.
that's
variously
called
under
weight-distance
tax
or
a
weight
--
weight-distance
and
ton-mile
tax.
but
that
was
unusual
at
that
time
and
states
--
narrow
states
such
as
indiana
and
new
jersey
could
be
caused
by
trucks
without
paying
anything,
unless
they
happen
to
stop
to
buy
gas
or
oil.
in
which
case,
they
would
pay
a
small
tax
on
the
oil
or
gasoline
purchase.
but
a
state
like
indiana
or
jersey,
the
tax
increased
very
largely,
the
size
and
strength
of
its
roads
and
its
bridges
was
in
effect
providing
a
free
right
of
way
for
these
large
trucks
which
caused
it.
unless
they
happened
to
be
licensed
in
the
state
of
illinois,
indiana,
oregon,
new
jersey
which
was
obviously
not
very
usual.
so
that
to
the
extent
that
the
legislatures
of
the
several
states
could
be
persuaded
to
refrain
from
levying
such
tax
as
the
weight-distance
tax
or
the
ton-mile
tax.
the
public
at
large
was
paying
a
large
portion
of
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
rights
of
way
of
these
trucking
companies
who
were
therefore
heavily
and
largely
at
public
expense.
studies
by
public
officials
of
various
states
and
of
the
united
states
indicate
that
--
that
that
was
their
conclusion.
and
they
were
urging
limitations,
the
limitations
be
maintained
on
these
hours
and
weight
of
trucks
or
that
their
fees
would
be
increased
because
of
the
enormously
increased
cost
of
building
these
new
roads
which
were
required
by
this
type
of
business.
thus,
the
right
of
way
cost
of
the
trucking
industry
was
not
based
primarily
on
use
or
on
economics
but
was
based
upon
what
the
legislatures
could
be
persuaded
to
grab
or
to
requote.
whereas,
the
railroads
during
this
period
of
time
obviously
had
to
pay
the
entire
cost
of
maintaining
their
own
rights
of
way
and
likewise
pay
it
in
many
cases
very
large
taxes
on
their
terminal
facilities.
so
that
in
this
setting,
the
petitioners
here
and
brought
to
on
a
public
relations
campaign
which
had
two
major
themes.
one
was
that
the
damage
done
to
roads
by
the
big
trucks
without
of
all
proportion
to
their
direct
weight
and
that
it
increased
in
geometrical
rather
than
arithmetical
ratio
when
compared
with
the
weight
and
size
of
the
trucks
and
that
those
trucks
do
not
pay
their
fair
share
of
the
cost
of
constructing
or
maintaining
the
roads.
the
question
to
this
case
is
whether
that
particular
public
relations
campaign
violates
the
sherman
act.
the
court
below
held
that
it
did
and
it
is
my
purpose
to
discuss
the
reasons
why
we
consider
that
decision
erroneous.
the
public
relations
campaign
was
presented
in
the
form
of
speeches,
press
releases,
articles,
magazine
articles
and
others.
all
of
it
except
some
films
and
purely
technical
fixes
has
been
reproduced
in
two
volumes
of
the
record,
this
large
one
and
volume
three,
the
smaller.
this
size
volume
was
prompted
by
the
desire
to
present
to
your
honors
the
magazine
articles
in
the
form
in
which
they
actually
appeared
in
the
magazines
and
this
is
the
size
of
the
saturday
evening
post.
all
of
these
articles
are
contained
in
those
two
volumes.
and
therefore,
the
material
which
was
presented
to
the
public
in
the
course
of
this
public
relations
campaign
is
all
documentary.
in
presenting
these
two
themes
which
i
have
mentioned,
there
were
only
five
subjects
which
were
the
subject
of
discussion.
and
each
on
--
in
the
brief
at
pages
6
and
7
are
listed,
the
various
exhibits
by
number
and
by
page
which
appear
in
volumes
2
and
3
of
the
record
under
the
category
which
property
describes
it.
and
those
five
categories
are
summarized
as
follows.
one
is
support
for
or
opposition
to
a
specific
legislated
bills
dealing
with
truck
weights
or
taxes
on
the
consideration
in
the
various
states.
two,
the
relationship
between
highway
maintenance
and
construction
costs
and
the
increased
use
of
heavy
trucks.
three,
the
need
for
and
sources
of
highway
funds
and
the
apportionment
of
taxes
among
highway
users
and
the
effect
of
heavy
trucks
upon
existing
highways
and
the
prevalence
for
--
and
the
reasons,
four,
overloading
of
trucks.
and
five,
highway
dangers
and
congestion
contributed
to
by
heavy
trucks.
now,
all
of
those
items,
all
of
those
topics
were
dealt
with
by
various
of
these
articles,
speeches,
press
releases
and
so
on.
but
since
they
are
all
here,
all
putted,
there's
no
question
in
this
case
of
the
accuracy
of
anyone's
memory.
there's
no
question
about
the
--
the
way
of
oral
testimony
which
your
honors
may
see
just
as
if
it
were
only
one
article,
one
speech,
one
book,
precisely
what
was
said
and
how
these
subjects
or
how
these
two
themes
were
presented
to
the
public.
mr.
philip
price
it
was
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
philip
price
they
maybe
considered
as
all
--
all
having
been
sponsored
by
the
--
by
the
conference
or
by
--
by
--
or
by
the
railroads.
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir.
no,
sir,
there
was
not.
this
--
this
campaign
was
conducted
by
what
was
termed
in
two
ways
for
the
court
below.
one,
the
third-party
technique
which
he
described
in
two
instances,
which
the
judge
described
the
two
instances,
as
what
he
called
the
big
lie.
what
it
amounted
to
was
this
that
if
there
was
material
that
was
asked
for
by
senator
neuberger,
for
example.
it
was
given
to
him
and
he
wrote
his
argument.
there
were
other
articles
which
were
written
entirely
by
representatives
insofar
the
public
relations
is
concerned.
articles
that
appeared
in
the
newspapers
were
combinations
of
both.
they
were
the
use
of
material
that
was
made
available
by
--
by
--
or
the
public
relations
consultant.
mr.
philip
price
there
were
two
or
three
only.
two,
i
shall
mention
specific
--
mr.
philip
price
may
i
ask
the
page,
sir.
mr.
philip
price
that's
an
editorial
in
the
buffalo
evening
news.
mr.
philip
price
that
was
offered
as
an
evidence
or
offered
in
evidences
as
plaintiffs'
exhibit

--
plaintiffs'
exhibit
295
(b)
as
an
illustration
of
the
material
that
was
being
put
up
as
a
result
of
the
public
relations
campaign
conducted
by
them.
mr.
philip
price
no,
not
directly.
this
--
this
particular
editorial
as
others
were
of
a
group,
some
of
each
were
--
were
prompted
by
the
editorial
writer's
interest
in
the
subject.
others
were
prompted
by
a
visit
from
someone
from
byoir
asking
him
to
discuss
to
this
subject.
mr.
philip
price
someone
--
representative
of
byoir,
the
public
relations
--
mr.
philip
price
--
agent.
mr.
philip
price
yes,
who
would
discuss
the
subject
with
him
and
ask
them
to
make
comments
either
by
editorial
or
--
or
other
ones.
mr.
philip
price
a
number
of
them
--
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir,
a
number
of
editorial
comments.
and
--
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir.
so
far
as
--
so
far
as
the
articles
were
concerned
--
mr.
philip
price
senator
(inaudible)?
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir.
so
far
as
i
know,
byoir
had
nothing,
whatever
to
do
with
that
particular
article.
the
--
the
--
there
was
some
evidence
if
i
recall
correctly
that
byoir
offered
some
statistical
data
to
the
senator
after
they
learned
he
was
writing
the
article
but
the
article
was
practically
finished
and
whether
it
was
used
or
not,
we
don't
know.
mr.
philip
price
the
reader's
digest
is
a
--
may
i
ask
the
page
of
that,
sir?
mr.
philip
price
that
is
a
condensation
of
--
i
don't
know,
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
record
indicates
that
that
was
not
written
by
or
sponsored
by
byoir.
mr.
philip
price
writ
--
either
written
or
sponsored
by
byoir.
mr.
philip
price
it
was
offered
as
an
--
offered
by
the
plaintiffs
as
an
exhibit,
as
an
indication
of
one
of
the
consequences
of
this
public
relations
campaign
because
the
--
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir.
there
were
a
number
of
articles
which
were
--
which
were
written
spontaneously
as
a
result
of
the
interest
that
was
generated
by
the
campaign
which
byoir
was
conducting.
some
of
the
--
most
of
the
articles
in
these
two
exhibits
were
--
i
think
you'll
quite
probably
describe
them
as
byoir
inspired
directly
or
a
number
of
them
were
purely
spontaneous.
what
they
were
--
mr.
philip
price
please,
your
honor.
mr.
philip
price
because
it
was
an
article
that
was
--
that
was
written
by
mr.
brownell
originally
about
overloaded
trucks
breaking
up
the
highway.
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir.
he
was
an
independent
writer.
mr.
philip
price
not
as
to
this
particular
article.
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
price
this
is
the
only
one
that
i
recall
by
mr.
brownell.
mr.
philip
price
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
philip
price
on
this
particular
one
(voice
overlap)
but
the
majority,
the
great
number
of
them
along
this
line,
sir,
were
initiated
by
some
activity
on
the
part
of
byoir.
they
were
prompted
by
an
offer
by
byoir
to
independent
writers
for
example
of
research,
the
opportunity
to
examine
statistics
which
byoir
had
collected.
in
one
or
two
instances,
byoir
wrote
the
article
or
byoir's
agent
wrote
the
article
directly.
in
one
or
two
instances,
byoir's
--
byoir
offered
to
finance
the
research
of
an
independent
writer
to
see
whether
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
write
an
article
or
not.
but
in
general,
you
may
say
that
the
bulk
of
the
material
that
appears
in
these
two
exhibits,
these
two
volumes
of
the
record,
were
the
result
of
byoir's
activity
in
promoting
this
idea
that
the
trucks
damaged
the
highways
excessively
and
did
not
pay
their
fair
share
of
maintenance.
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir.
that
was
paid
for
by
the
railroads
(inaudible)
the
pennsylvania
--
mr.
philip
price
that's
right.
the
pennsylvania
state
association
of
township
supervisors
was
an
organization
of
supervisors
in
pennsylvania
which
for
a
long
time
has
been
fighting
increase
weights
in
trucks
because
of
the
damage
it
did
--
mr.
philip
price
oh,
yes.
it's
an
association
of
the
supervisors
of
the
townships
of
pennsylvania
who
had
a
direct
interest
in
the
cost
of
maintaining
roads
and
the
cost
of
maintaining
bridges.
and
therefore,
for
a
number
of
years,
they
had
been
imposed
to
increase
truck
weights
and
decrease
truck
fee.
mr.
philip
price
that's
right.
mr.
philip
price
oh
no,
no.
mr.
philip
price
oh,
no
and
that's
all.
no,
sir.
that
had
been
in
existence
for
a
long
time.
and
if
your
honor
will
turn
back
one
page,
you
will
see
another
advertisement.
you
can't
satisfy
rhode
island.
that
likewise
was
paid
for
by
the
railroads
but
put
out
in
the
name
of
the
township
supervisors
which
asked
for
the
opportunity
to
publish
that
information.
mr.
philip
price
now,
contrast
it
--
mr.
philip
price
the
charge
of
falsity
was
made
by
the
respondent's
only
in
respect
of
the
concealment
of
the
source.
there
was
no
attempt
to
show
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir,
of
the
source,
but
not
as
to
misinterpretation
of
the
facts
which
appeared
either
in
the
articles
or
in
the
advertisement's
or
otherwise.
there
was
a
considerable
differences
of
opinion
as
to
the
extent
to
which
roads
were
damaged
by
trucks.
and
that
argument
went
on
extensively.
but
so
far
as
statistical
data
is
concerned,
there
was
no
attempt
to
show
by
any
evidence
that
anything
contained
in
the
petitioner's
material
was
not
accurate.
in
fact,
the
only
effort
to
show
facts
was
rejected
by
the
court
on
the
ground
that
there
was
no
substantial
dispute
about
the
facts
and
that
he
heard
enough
of
it
and
would
not
allow
any
evidence
on
that
subject.
mr.
philip
price
the
question
is
raised
by
the
first
--
by
the
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act.
our
contention
--
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir.
our
contention
is
this,
that
the
sherman
act
is
not
violated
by
this
particular
public
relations
campaign.
the
court
below
held
it
was
that
it
--
that
the
sherman
act
prohibited
this
kind
of
campaign,
so
that
the
only
question
that
was
raised
there
was
whether
the
campaign
itself
was
in
violation
of
the
terms
for
sherman
act.
now,
if
your
honors
conclude
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
terms
of
the
sherman
act,
it
isn't
prohibited
by
that
statute,
there
isn't
any
constitutional
question
involved.
however,
if
it
should
be
considered
that
the
statute
might
be
extended
that
far,
then,
a
constitutional
question
is
raised.
mr.
philip
price
yes,
sir.
it's
in
the
statutes
involved,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
we
referred
in
the
first
amendment
as
having
been
raised
by
this.
it
comes
up
only
if
your
honors
should
consider
that
there
might
have
been
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
by
this
particular
public
relations
campaign.
then,
if
you
get
to
that
point
that
constitutional
question
would
be
raised
but
it
isn't
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir.
i
can't
--
i
can't
say
that
but
i
will
say
that
i
think
that
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
sherman
act
would
lead
you
very
far
and
short
of
the
constitutional
questions.
mr.
philip
price
not
essentially
because
the
sherman
act
is
designed
to
prevent
private
agreements
producing
restraints
or
monopoly.
whereas,
the
only
--
mr.
philip
price
--
thrust
of
this
campaign.
mr.
philip
price
oh,
no.
the
consequence
--
oh,
that
undoubtedly.
the
consequence
of
the
agreement
was
not
any
restraint.
there
couldn't
have
been
any
restraint
in
the
absence
of
legislative
action
because
the
thrust
of
this
public
relations
campaign
was
not
to
restrict
the
truckers
in
any
way
or
to
create
any
private
restraint
in
the
operation
of
the
truck
business.
it
could
only
have
been
restrained
by
acts
of
the
legislature
in
imposing
the
type
of
taxes
which
had
been
in
existence
in
the
state
of
oregon
and
which
the
railroads
urged
--
should
be
adopted
in
other
states.
that's
the
only
restraint
and
therefore,
the
legislative
action
which
might
have
produced
a
mis
--
restraint
or
a
monopoly
is
not
the
kind
of
restraint
or
monopoly
which
was
prohibited
by
the
sherman
act.
that
is
our
fundamental
position
and
we
say
that
the
sherman
act
should
be
construed
not
as
the
court
below
did
but
construed
not
to
apply
to
this
type
of
public
relations
campaign
because
it
was
directed
to
legislation.
mr.
philip
price
no,
sir.
we
did
not
think
--
mr.
philip
price
yeah.
no,
that
--
that
decision
was
not
printed
among
the
documents.
may
i
illustrate
by
references
to
two
or
three
of
these
documents,
the
type
of
a
post
that
was
made
in
the
course
of
this
campaign.
for
example,
the
first
one
--
the
first
article,
(inaudible)
the
first
one
in
this
document,
was
described
by
the
court
below
as
damming
the
truckers.
it
was
referred
to
in
the
section
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
which
has
headed
a
campaign
of
vilification.
it
is
classified
by
the
court
below
as
a
means
of
providing
the
base
of
a
permit
arousing
the
resentment
of
the
general
public.
and
yet,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
article,
it
is
a
discussion
of
the
transportation
industry
with
particular
reference
to
the
dangers
of
socialism
which
had
been
incurred
by
england
in
their
nationalization
of
the
railroads.
another
article
was
called,
"history,
trucks
and
money,"
which
was
described
by
the
court
below
as
skillfully
designed
to
arouse
the
farmers
in
opposition
to
legis
--
opposition
to
the
trucks.
but
the
truly
legislative
thrust
of
that
article
is
illustrated
best
by
the
last
paragraph
which
reads,
"so
if
you
are
interested
in
your
roads
as
every
farmer
must
be,
you
will
demand
that
your
state
legislature
pass
effective
legislation
for
limiting
the
weight
of
the
big
trucks
from
enforcing
the
limitations
or
for
making
them
pay
taxes
toward
upkeep
of
the
roads
based
on
a
weight
they
carry
and
the
distance
they
travel."
and
again,
in
the
article,
"who
shall
pay
for
our
roads?"
the
--
written
by
senator
nuebaker
--
nueberger.
the
last
three
lines
of
that
was,
"wouldn't
it
be
better
to
defeat
the
lobby
wherever
it
appears
and
enact
the
weight-distance
tax
in
every
state,
so
that
all
of
these
articles,
all
of
these
materials
was
directed
toward
the
achievement
of
legislation.
and
for
that
reason,
we
say
that
the
sherman
act
could
imply
to
it
that
the
sherman
act
does
not
purport
to
--
to
regulate
the
legislation
which
may
create
restraints
or
which
may
create
monopoly.
mr.
philip
price
that's
the
only
type
--
mr.
philip
price
lobby?
i
would
say
no.
that's
neutral.
mr.
philip
price
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
of
them
were
false
in
this
case.
but
i
would
say
that
the
--
that
the
proposition
of
the
applicability
or
non-applicability
of
the
sherman
act
to
this
type
of
campaign
would
not
be
dependent
upon
the
truth
or
falsity
of
(inaudible).
your
honor
will
remember
there's
a
one
time
people
went
to
jail
for
asserting
that
the
world
was
round
and
the
question
of
truth
or
falsity
frequently
becomes
one
of
debate
or
opinion.
and
particularly
in
a
--
in
a
field
such
as
this
where
it
is
a
matter
of
great
divergence
of
opinion,
the
extent
to
which
trucks
do
damage
roads
in
the
extent
to
which
they
should
made
in
favor
of
--
favor
of
and
that's
the
only
question
that
was
raised
here
by
this
campaign.
mr.
philip
price
no.
i
would
say
not
in
this
--
in
the
posture
of
this
case.
mr.
philip
price
not
--
not
so
far
as
the
applicability
of
the
sherman
act's
concerned
over
the
constitution.
mr.
philip
price
what
the
--
what
the
court
said
in
that
particular
instance
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
an
examination
of
these
documents
such
as
the
articles
to
which
i've
referred
because
in
the
court's
mind,
anything
that
was
presented
from
the
railroad's
point
of
view
in
which
not
--
did
not
at
the
same
time
present
the
countervailing
point
of
view
of
the
truckers,
was
slanted,
was
a
misrepresentation,
was
propaganda
and
was
a
part
of
this
big
lie
concept.
in
other
words,
in
the
absence
of
complete
objectivity,
the
presentation
of
both
sides
of
the
picture
at
the
same
time,
there
was
this
unfortunate
atmosphere
which
the
court
described
as
the
big
lie.
now
i
should
like
in
my
remaining
few
minutes
to
refer
to
the
decree
because
that
illustrates
more
clearly
the
consequences
which
this
court
gets
as
a
visual
by
virtue
of
holding
that
the
sherman
act
is
violated
by
a
public
relations
campaign
of
this
sort.
the
court
entered
a
decree
which
restrains
the
railroads
from
--
in
concert,
combining
to
do
anything
which
would
restrict
to
prevent
the
existence,
growth,
development
or
expansion
of
the
trucking
industry
by
any
of
these
--
mr.
philip
price
that's
on
page
164
of
volume
4
of
the
record.
one,
seeking
to
create
resentment
or
hostility
to
plaintiffs
in
the
minds
of
the
general
public.
in
other
words,
if
we
do
anything
which
would
the
lead
the
public
to
think
any
less
of
the
truckers
or
the
trucking
industry,
that
would
violate
this
decree.
two,
seeking
to
create
resentment
or
hostility
to
plaintiffs
in
the
minds
of
those
persons
who
utilize
or
may
utilize
the
services
of
plaintiffs'
trucks
and
in
such
a
manner
as
to
interfere
with
business
relations
between
the
shippers
and
the
plaintiffs.
now,
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
of
any
interference
with
the
business
relations
or
between
the
truckers,
the
plaintiffs
and
their
--
and
their
shipment.
the
only
evidence
that
was
presented
was
--
of
damage
was
that
by
virtue
of
the
veto
of
the
pennsylvania
legislature
known
as
sb
615,
the
big
truck
bill
in
pennsylvania.
the
plaintiffs
were
unable
--
the
respondents
were
unable
to
carry
as
much
freight
as
otherwise
they
would
have
been
able
to
do.
and
the
stipulation
was
entered
into
which
agreed
that
the
only
damage
they
suffered
in
this
case
was
that
caused
by
the
failure
or
by
the
veto
by
the
government
of
that
particular
piece
of
legislation.
so
that
--
mr.
philip
price
oh,
yes.
mr.
philip
price
oh,
yes.
yes,
sir.
and
judge
biggs
refers
to
it
at
some
detail
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
below.
there
was
a
comparable
campaign
going
on
and
being
conducted
by
the
truckers.
that
was
the
basis
of
the
contention
in
the
counterclaim
but
it
is
not
raised
in
this
field.
third,
seeking
to
create
resentment
or
hostility
to
plaintiffs
in
the
minds
of
legislators,
law
enforcement
officers,
or
other
public
officials
or
members
of
any
branch
of
government.
in
other
words,
under
the
terms
of
this
decree,
it
would
be
violated
if
we
should
go
to
the
legislature
and
ask
them
for
any
of
this
legislation
which
was
sought
in
the
course
of
this
public
relations
campaign.
four,
publishing
or
causing
the
publication
or
dissemination
of
false,
defamatory
or
derogatory
material
with
regard
to
the
plaintiffs
or
their
business,
so
that
if
anything
that
might
be
considered
later
on
to
be
offensive
or
derogatory
of
the
plaintiff
is
published,
it
violates
this
decree.
mr.
philip
price
that
would
not
be
justified
by
anything
in
the
sherman
act.
there
is
nothing
in
the
sherman
act
which
purports
to
deal
with
truth
or
falsity
and
there
is
nothing
in
any
other
statutes
that
i
know
of
that
would
allow
a
decree
under
the
sherman
act
to
prohibit
the
dissemination
of
false
material.
if
false
material
is
published,
it
may
give
rise
to
rights
or
obligations
under
other
laws
or
other
situations
but
not
so
far
as
the
sherman
act
is
concerned.
mr.
philip
price
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act
if
the
purpose
was
to
injure
the
business
through
the
adoption
of
legislation.
it
might
be
if
it
were
for
the
purpose
of
injuring
the
business
through
depriving
them
of
business
which
they
otherwise
might
have
by
defamatory
statements
such
as
--
such
as
those
which
would
criticize
the
means
or
ability
of
truckers
to
do
their
transportation
work.
but
that
isn't
in
this
case.
and
the
only
thing
we
have
here
is
a
legislative
consequence
produced
by
an
appeal
to
the
legislature.
now,
instead
--
mr.
philip
price
it
might
have
but
before
there
could
be
any
recovery
under
the
sherman
act,
that
would
have
to
be
shown
as
a
fact
unlike
a
conspiracy
which
is
attacked
with
the
criminal
side
of
the
sherman
act.
you
don't
have
to
show
consequences
whereas
under
the
civil
side,
it
is
necessary
to
show
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
that
did
in
--
in
fact
produce
some
damage.
now,
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
here,
no
attempt
to
--
no
attempt
to
offer
any
such
evidence
and
the
stipulation
entered
into
expressly
stated
that
the
only
damage
suffered
by
any
of
these
trucking
plaintiffs
was
due
to
the
veto
by
governor
(inaudible)
of
this
sb
615
legislation.
this
legislative
approach
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
attitude
taken
by
the
respondents
themselves
during
the
trial.
their
proposition
was
very
simply
stated
and
it
was
stuck
to
and
with
no
departure.
it
was
simply
this.
the
petitioners
have
combined
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
the
legislatures
of
the
various
states
to
enact
legislation
which
will
be
economically
harmful
to
the
truckers,
ergo,
the
sherman
act
is
violated.
now,
we
say
that
can't
be
so
under
the
american
banana
case
and
other
cases
where
a
legislation
is
ipso
facto,
lawful
and
therefore
the
--
a
conspiracy
or
agreement
to
achieve
legislation
can't
be
unlawful
and
not
only
couldn't
be
prohibited
by
the
sherman
act,
what
has
never
been
attempted
to
be
prohibited
by
the
sherman
act.
one
more
word
before
i
close
on
the
subject
of
damages.
with
reference
to
the
damage
by
the
--
to
the
individual
trucking
companies
themselves,
the
court
below
held
quite
properly
that
to
the
extent
they
were
damaged
by
the
veto,
they
could
not
be
recover.
that
legislative
action
or
governmental
action
of
that
character
did
not
give
rise
to
the
compensable
damages
under
the
sherman
act.
therefore,
they
could
not
recover
but
the
court
awarded
them
18
cents
anyhow.
i
submit
the
that
was
a
voluntary
act
which
was
unjustified.
insofar
as
the
pmta,
the
train
association
is
concerned,
that
didn't
suffer
any
damage
at
all
as
a
result
of
this
activity
directed
against
the
long-haul
trucking
industry.
the
association
is
not
a
trucker.
and
obviously,
under
the
trade
association,
it
may
not
recover
damages
on
behalf
of
its
members.
the
trucking
association
spent
money
which
was
given
to
it.
if
it
hadn't
been
given
to
it,
it
wouldn't
have
spent
it.
and
it
suffered
no
damage
whatever
because
the
amount
that
was
allowed
on
the
court
below
was
not
the
amount
that
was
contributed
to
it
by
the
trucking
members
but
the
amount
or
some
of
the
amounts
that
it
spent.
now,
if
it
had
been
allowed
to
recover
for
the
amounts
contributed
by
the
train
company
members
that
would've
violated
the
terms
and
stipulation
and
would
have
given
it
a
reward
which
the
stipulation
excluded,
but
since
it's
only
trade
association
and
since
it
wasn't
damaged
at
all
in
itself
as
a
result
of
anything
done
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
we
say
that
it
was
not
entitled
to
recover
any
damages
to
fight
it,
and
for
that
reason,
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
