mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
my
reply
by
observing
that
since
this
is
a
sherman
act
case.
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
the
petitioners
combined
and
conspired
to
restrain
trade,
and
i
should
like
to
emphasize
that
the
question
is
not
whether
the
petitioners
did
something
wrong
or
immoral
or
against
public
policy
or
even
may
perhaps
have
violated
some
statute
other
than
the
sherman
act.
the
question
is,
whether
they
combined
and
conspired
to
restrain
trade?
now,
the
sherman
act
is
a
statute
that
is
directed
at
certain
specified
economic
consequences.
so
i
suggest
that
what
we
should,
is
the
--
with
the
court's
permission
to
consider
it,
is
what
the
economic
consequences
were
to
which
this
concerted
action
of
the
petitioner
was
directed.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
these
public
relations
campaign
which
the
petitioners
engaged
in
was
wholly
legislative
or
governmental
in
its
purposes
and
in
its
effects.
what
they
were
doing
was
trying
to
get
the
state
legislature
to
pass
laws
that
would
admittedly
limit,
cripple
the
competitive
power
of
the
trucks.
now,
we
say
that
that
kind
of
a
restraint,
a
restraint
imposed
by
valid
state
actions,
admittedly
valid
here
is
not
an
unlawful
restraint
or
monopolization
within
the
meaning
of
the
sherman
act.
we
also
suggest
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
for
the
purposes
of
that
proposition
what
means
or
methods
you
use
to
get
state
to
take
that
action.
they
maybe
wrong
and
they
maybe
unlawful
under
other
statutes
but
they
do
not
violate
the
sherman
act
because
it
restraint
itself
which
the
state
imposes,
does
not
violate
the
sherman
act.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
i
was
--
in
fact
that
the
point
of
dealing
with
the
contention
which
is
based
on
what
the
lower
court
and
the
district
court
said
that
this
campaign
was
not
wholly
legislative
in
its
purposes
and
effects.
now,
what
the
district
court
held
in
that
passage
in
elsewhere
was
that
this
campaign
although
admittedly
legislative
in
large
part
was
accompanied
by
a
purpose
to
injure
the
good
will
of
the
trucking
industry
and
that
it
had
the
effect
of
injury
in
the
good
will
of
the
trucking
industry.
now,
i
should
like
to
submit
that
the
district
court's
own
language
on
what
it
meant
by
good
will
shows
what
is
essentially
wrong
with
that
argument.
there
is
a
passage
in
volume
4
of
the
record
at
105
where
the
district
court
explains
what
it
means
by
good
will.
it
says
when
it's
talking
about
injury
of
good
will
it
means
that
it
uses
the
word
good
will
in
two
senses,
first,
in
the
sense
of
loss
of
business,
loss
of
truck.
now,
i
like
to
stop
and
deal
if
i
may
with
that
aspect
of
the
alleged
impact
and
purpose
of
the
conspiracy.
there
isn't
a
scrap
of
evidence
in
this
record,
not
a
scrap
and
the
respondent's
brief
and
in
his
--
respondent's
argument
that
we
refer
to
any
evidence.
there
isn't
a
scrap
of
evidence
that
any
single
trucker
or
the
trucking
industry
as
a
whole
never
lost
a
pound
of
traffic
as
a
result
of
this
public
relations
campaign.
there
is
proof
that
they
lost
some
traffic
that
they
might
have
had
if
the
governor
of
pennsylvania
hadn't
decode
a
bill,
but
there
isn't
any
proof
that
the
public
relations
campaign
ever
caused
them
to
loss
any
traffic.
they
have
not
pointed
to
any
piece
of
publicity
and
i
--
it
was
all
in
my
understanding
that
all
of
the
publicities
are
here
in
which
the
petitioners
say
--
which
was
addressed
to
the
shippers
and
which
said
the
shippers
don't
ship
by
trucks.
we
mustn't
ship
by
trucks.
stay
away
from
the
trucks.
this
publicity
is
all
directed
to
arguments
about
how
much
taxes
the
truck
should
pay.
how
heavy
--
what
weight
limit
should
be
imposed
on
them?
whether
they
injure
the
roads,
whether
if
they
are
on
the
bridges?
that's
what
this
publicity
is
about.
so
i
say
that
you
cannot
predicate
liability
in
this
case
where
you
cannot
find
the
restrain
of
trade
in
this
case
or
a
purpose
to
restrain
trade
in
this
case
on
this
first
definition
of
good
will
because
there
simply
isn't
any
evidence
to
support
it.
and
by
the
way
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
we
raised
in
the
--
in
the
first
and
the
third
questions
presented
the
correctness
of
these
conclusions
that
the
district
court
as
to
the
purpose
and
the
impact
of
this
public
relations
campaign.
i
think
there
is
no
question
about
that.
we
--
we
attacked
those
conclusions.
they
say
that
they
are
clearly
wrong
and
one
on
the
--
the
lawsuit,
a
business
is
clearly
wrong,
not
in
the
sense
that
--
as
a
preponderance
of
evidence
against
it
or
that
there
--
there
is
some
evidence
to
support
you.
it's
wrong
in
the
sense
that's
just
isn't
any
evidence
at
all.
now,
this
court
demonstrated,
it
was
talking
about
good
will
in
a
second
sense
and
this
i
think
is
particularly
interesting,
it's
baring
on
what
the
court
was
really
talking
about
in
this
case.
it
said
that
it
was
talking
about
injury
to
good
will
in
the
sense
that
the
petitioners
brought
the
respondents
of
trucking
industry
into
discredit,
discredit
that
done
in
the
eyes
of
the
public,
and
thus,
removing
the
likelihood
that
the
truckers
could
gain
public
support
and
appreciation
and
sympathy
which
the
court
said
would
be
essential
to
avoid
the
imposition
of
crippling
burdens
and
restrictions.
it
seems
i
think
without
any
doubt
that
that
last
finding
of
conclusion
of
the
court
expects
the
good
will,
speaking
of
good
will
in
the
legislative
sense,
it
couldn't
have
meant
anything
else.
the
imposition
of
crippling
burdens
of
restrictions
was
purely
key
to
all
the
evidence
in
this
case
about
the
state
legislation
which
the
truckers
were
seeking
or
which
the
petitioners
were
seeking
to
get.
so
that
--
i
would
say
furthermore,
in
response
to
your
question
about
these
conclusions
that
in
our
brief,
we
have
made
--
it's
not
very
long
but
it's
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
particularized
findings
of
the
district
court
as
opposed
to
its
general
conclusions
and
of
the
evidence.
and
we
submit
that
when
that
is
examined,
it
appears
both
from
the
particularized
findings
and
from
the
evidence
that
this
campaign
was
wholly
legislative
in
its
purposes
and
its
effects.
the
evidence,
the
best
evidence
about
purpose
in
the
record
is
the
documents
which
the
petitioners
and
the
public
relations
agent
wrote
at
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
when
it
was
being
planned.
those
are
the
kind
of
documents
that
are
always
used
in
the
antitrust
case
to
prove
purposes
and
they
are
usually
very
effective
for
that
the
reason
that
they
are
contemporaneous
and
these
documents
which
the
district
court
made
some
particularized
findings
about
which
are
consistent
with
what
i
have
to
say.
the
documents
in
themselves
show
that
this
campaign
was
a
legislative
campaign
and
that
byoir
was
detained
because
byoir
had
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
legislative
method.
the
district
court
himself
after
he
finished
describing
what
he
call
the
campaign
of
vilification,
in
a
very
interesting
passage
which
we've
quoted
in
our
brief
said,
"the
cap
of
the
pyramid
in
each
state
was
legislation"
and
then
it
goes
on
in
that
passage
to
specify
the
various
kinds
of
legislation
which
this
campaign
was
designed
to
get
--
which
it
did
get.
so
that
--
we
submit
that
--
that
this
real
issue
in
this
case
and
i
noticed
by
the
way
that
the
greater
part
of
respondent's
argument
was
devoted
to
that
issue.
the
real
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
if
men
act
in
concert
to
get
a
state
government
to
impose
restrictions
on
their
competitors
which
will
creepily
competitive
power
of
their
competitors,
that
action
in
concert
violates
the
antitrust
law.
now,
i
think
i
have
stated
our
basic
position
on
that
earlier
when
i
said
that
since
the
restraint,
the
economic
consequence
which
that
action
produces
is
itself
lawful
and
lawful
under
the
--
the
constitution
of
this
country
for
all
purposes
if
it's
valid
and
they
admit
this
legislation
here
involved
and
valid.
if
it's
lawful
for
all
purposes,
then
the
economic
consequences
it
produces
cannot
be
unlawful
restraints
and
monopolization.
and
if
the
consequence
is
not
unlawful,
surely
the
purpose
to
achieve
that
consequence
is
not
an
unlawful
purpose.
i
might
add
to
the
part
from
that
argument
which
i
think
stands
on
its
own
feet.
i
should
like
to
merely
observe
in
passing
that
if
you
hold
that
that
kind
of
consorted
action
does
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
it
seems
to
me
the
court
is
faced
with
a
problem
of
inquiring
into
the
reasons
and
motives
for
the
legislative
action
by
the
states,
because
the
sherman
act
is
a
statute
that
does
require
some
causative
showing
as
between
the
activities
of
the
alleged
conspirators
and
the
economic
consequence
the
--
the
statute
prohibits.
and
i
also
observe
that
ever
since
fletcher
against
peck,
this
court
and
all
the
federal
court,
most
state
courts
have
been
most
reluctant
in
most
--
most
cases
declined
to
enter
into
kind
of
inquiry
about
legislative
reasons
and
legislative
motive.
i
should
now
like
to
come
back
to
the
point,
deal
with
it
more
specifically.
before
i
do
that,
may
i
say
this,
that
there
were
brief
many
cases
that
are
referred
to
this
morning
by
counsel
on
this
question
of
whether
you
violate
the
antitrust
laws
by
combining
to
get
to
govern
--
valid
governmental
action
that
helps
you.
i
think
i
can
say
that
i
didn't
seem
to
meet
any
of
those
cases
had
any
bearing
on
this
--
this
question
here.
those
cases
in
my
judgment
all
represent
situations
where
the
alleged
restraint
or
monopolization
was
an
--
was
a
restraint
or
monopolization
that
was
imposed
or
occurred
apart
from
governmental
action.
now,
of
course
if
you
have
a
restraint
of
that
kind
and
you
helped
to
bring
it
about,
not
by
the
governmental
action
but
by
something
you
do
in
relation
to
the
government,
that
is
a
different
problem.
but,
in
case
like
the
georgia
case
where
the
real
question
was
whether
consorted
action
not
subject
to
regulation
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws,
that
kind
of
a
case
which
--
where
the
--
where
the
restraint
was
imposed
outside
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that's
what
this
court
held.
that
case
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
problem.
our
counsel
referred
to
the
borden
case.
i
do
the
indictment
of
the
borden
case.
i
think
i
know
something
about
that.
it
wasn't
tried
on
merits.
the
allegation
in
the
borden
case
was
that
certain
government
officials
in
chicago
in
willful
disregard
and
disobedience
of
their
statutory
duties
had
joined
the
conspiracy.
well,
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
a
case
in
which
you
are
alleged
and
that
are
restraint
imposed
by
a
state
action
in
an
unlawful
monopoly.
that
was
a
case
where
people
went
outside
their
official
duties
and
became
private
really
they
exercise
their
private
rights
joining
the
conspiracy.
i
can't
--
i
don't
have
time
to
talk
about
all
of
those
cases
but
i
honestly
suggest
that
when
the
cases
were
examined,
that
they
do
not
bear
on
his
problem,
they
are
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
parker
against
brown,
the
california
case,
the
rock
royal
case,
american
banana
case,
olsen
against
smith,
which
we
think
taken
together,
support
the
argument
on
principle
that
i
have
made
this
morning
to
the
effect
that
state
action
no
matter
how
induced,
does
not
produce
an
unlawful
--
if
valid,
does
not
produce
an
unlawful
restraint
or
monopolization.
now,
i
should
like
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
time
to
a
discussion
to
a
--
the
--
what
relevance
there
is
in
this
case
to
the
fact
that
the
railroads
did
not
disclose
the
source
which
is
quite
true
in
this
material.
now,
i
submit
that
the
argument
is
based
on
that
fact.
it
seems
to
me
they
rest
on
a
misapprehension
about
carry
through
the
sherman
act.
i
come
back
to
my
basic
proposition
that
it's
an
act
to
deal
with
certain
economic
consequences.
the
economic
consequences
were
here,
were
to
be
achieved
by
state
action
which
is
conceded
to
have
been
valid.
now,
that's
true.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
you
didn't
disclose
the
source.
i
think
it
might
have
been
wrong
not
to.
i'm
not
condoning
what
was
done
here.
judge
biggs
in
the
circuit
court
who
dissented
was
shocked
by
what
--
both
the
truckers
and
the
railroads
had
done,
but
that
is
really
irrelevant
to
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
a
third-party
technique
itself
restraints
trade.
now,
our
position
on
that
is
that
since
the
technique
was
used
to
induce
valid
governmental
action
and
that
action
doesn't
restrain
trade
with
the
use
of
the
technique
is
really
irrelevant.
i
think
that
our
position
is
the
same
with
the
respect
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
arguments
that
were
made
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
we
don't
concede
that
the
--
that
these
arguments
were
false
and
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioners
offered
to
prove
that
what
they
said
about
trucks
injuring
bridges
and
roads
and
what
they
said
about
the
maryland
road
test
and
what
they
said
about
trucks
not
paying
their
fair
share.
the
tax
is
needed
to
maintain
roads.
they
offered
to
put
in
material
--
try
to
put
in
material
to
prove
that
those
facts
or
opinions
were
true
and
the
district
court
excluded
it.
the
offer
to
the
proof
were
in
the
record.
it
was
excluded
on
the
ground
that
it
was
irrelevant.
but
our
position
here
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
your
honor,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
that
was
not
my
conclusion,
i
should
prefer
not
to
attempt
to
explain
it
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes,
i
think
--
then
i
want
to
be
quite
excellent
about
this.
the
district
court
did
allow
some
times
that
prove
him
--
which
had
some
bearing
on
this
question
of
truth
for
example.
he
allowed
the
railroads
to
introduce
stipulated
material
which
showed
that
these
respondents
in
his
case
in
a
three
or
four-year
period
had
violated
the
overweight
regulation
sustained
about
3000
times,
which
was
of
course
proved
to
justify
what
have
been
said
in
the
publicity
about
trucks
frequently
operating
over
the
weight
limits.
but
when
the
respondent
--
the
petitioners
tried
to
put
in
proof
about
how
roads
are
built
and
how
many
--
what
part
of
the
roads
in
the
--
in
the
eastern
part
of
united
states
are
constructed
on
the
kind
of
subsoil
or
in
the
way
which
will
enable
them
to
stand
up
to
heavy
trucks.
the
judge
said,
"that's
all
irrelevant.
and
i'm
not
going
to
admit
it
into
evidence."
now,
i
think
--
i
can't
--
i
don't
i
should
try
to
explain
it.
but
our
position
does
not
depend
on
the
truth
what
was
said
here
because
it
is
our
position
again,
that
since
what
the
petitioners
were
seeking
to
do
in
this
case
was
to
induce
valid
state
action.
then
the
fact
that
in
expressing
these
opinions
or
they
are
making
these
arguments
they
may
--
they
did
not
assumed
that
they
didn't
speak
the
truth.
the
fact
still
remains
that
that
does
not
change
the
character
of
the
restraint
which
was
involved,
which
was
a
lawful
restraint
intended.
their
actions
were
indirect
to
restraint
and
the
restraint
was
imposed
into
a
lawful
restraint
and
the
character
of
the
restraint
is
not
changed
by
the
character
of
the
methods
that
the
petitioners
may
be
assumed
to
abused
in
attempting
to
persuade
the
state
between
(inaudible).
i
should
--
there
is
one
further
point
that
i
should
like
to
make
in
relation
to
the
character
of
this
case,
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
injunction.
now,
both
mr.
price
and
the
counsel
for
respondents
have
discussed
the
injunction
and
i
should
prefer
not
to
take
the
court
throughout
in
detail.
but
i
should
like
to
make
this
point
to
the
court
that
if
there
is
any
doubt
that
this
case
is
about
legislative
effort
and
about
the
public
debate
and
discussion
of
issues,
the
public
policy,
that
doubt
is
removed
by
the
terms
of
the
injunction
because
the
injunction
by
its
terms
is
not
in
any
material
sense
directed
to
commercial
practices
or
the
things
that
are
specifically
directed
to
the
trucker's
customers.
let's
say
the
injunction
which
is
cast
in
broad
terms,
is
directed
to
public
debate
and
discussion.
it
prohibits
for
example
the
--
mr.
price
pointed,
the
petitioners
in
concert,
from
saying
anything
that
is
--
that
may
create
--
present
mother
hostility
to
the
truckers,
irrespective
of
whether
it's
true
in
those
provisions
of
the
injunction,
irrespective
of
whether
it
has
to
do
with
the
legislative
proposed.
it
does
enjoin
the
petitioners
from
seeking
legislation,
maybe
beneficial
to
them
or
crippling
to
the
truckers
and
i
think
mr.
kohn
does
not
misunderstand
that
subparagraph
9
because
subparagraph
9
by
its
terms
says
that
you
--
the
petitioners
can't
seek
legislation
which
should
--
is
designed
to
impose
weight
limitations
or
taxes
or
anything
that
kind,
irrespective
whether
they
use
a
third-party
technique.
the
third-party
technique
qualification
implies
to
the
opposing
part
--
clause
of
the
--
by
its
terms
which
is
the
last
clause
in
subparagraph
9,
but
that
doesn't
--
that's
not
the
point
which
i'm
trying
to
make.
now,
i'm
--
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
this
is
a
legislative
case.
it
is
a
public
debate
and
discussion
case
and
you
can't
--
you
can't
cure
this
injunction
by
trying
to
regret
it
because
the
injunction
exactly
and
precisely
mirrors
the
caue
of
action
here.
the
things
that
are
prohibited
there
in
the
injunction,
all
and
with
the
things
that
the
district
court,
certainly
the
majority
to
the
circuit
court,
found
violated
the
statute
and
you
can't
by
changing
a
word
here
or
changing
provisions
there
preserved
these
cause
of
action
by
trying
to
change
the
injunction.
the
--
the
injunction
is
significant
because
of
our
judgment.
it
shows
what's
wrong
with
this
case.
it
is
a
case
in
which
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
apply
the
sherman
act
in
an
area,
not
of
commercial
practices,
coercive,
restrictive,
noncompetitive.
it's
an
attempt
to
apply
the
sherman
act
in
the
area
of
public
debate,
public
discussion,
legislative
effort,
an
area
to
which
the
statute
was
never
intended
to
apply.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
case,
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
think
started
the
trial
in
--
in
the
fall
--
fall
of
1956
and
there
were
some
adjournments
because
they
tried
one
part
of
first,
another
part
later
and
went
over.
i
think
the
trial
was
finally
concluded
early
in
the
winter
of
1957,
february
(inaudible).there
were
gaps
in
the
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
my
--
my
first
comment
on
that
is
that
there's
nothing
in
this
record
in
this
case
that
would
justify
that
kind
of
injunction
on
the
sherman
act.
there's
none.
it's
not
an
appropriate
injunction
in
this
case
because
there
wasn't
any
--
there
has
been
no
showing
that
there
was
a
combination
of
conspiracy
here
to
restrain
trade
or
that
it
had
any
--
it
was
intended
to
restrain
trade.
but,
if
you're
speaking
out
merely
in
terms
of
the
injunction,
i
would
like
to
assert
that
i
suppose
that
five
does
not
and
cannot
consistently
qualify
the
prohibitions
or
limit
prohibitions
that
are
made
in
paragraph
4
because
did
the
injunction
will
be
internally
inconsistent.
i
take
that
the
provisions
in
--
in
section
4
stand
and
that
this
simply
says
that
of
course
you
can
--
you
can
improve
your
own
facilities
or
you
can
seek
legislative,
administrative
rather
governmental
benefits
for
yourself
so
long
as
you
don't
seek
going
back
to
board
to
create
resentment
or
hostility
and
so
forth.
you
have
to
read
it
that
way
to
make
it
consistent
of
it.
