chief

is
there
any
evidence,
they
paid
for
those
editorials?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
price,
in
your
various
case,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
these
statements
are
true
or
false?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
only
reason
i
asked
was
because
you
mentioned
that
part
of
judges'
decision
where
he
referred
to
the
big
lie.
he
also
said
in
that
same
paragraph,
speaking
of
the
--
what
he
found
was
a
conspiracy
to
this
end
by
or
assuredly
chose
the
obvious
shortcomings
of
the
trucking
industry
and
by
use
of
dramatic
segments
of
truth,
distorted
them
into
complete
falsehoods
while
byoir
chose
the
appellation
of
third-party
technique
for
its
act
--
activities,
i
prefer
to
treat
the
whole
procedure
in
its
true
light
which
is
the
technique
of
the
big
lie.
now,
my
--
my
question
was
directed
to
--
to
whether
in
--
in
your
opinion
if
it
makes
any
difference
whether
that
is
the
fact
that
there
isn't
a
fact.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
makes
no
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
that
--
suppose
that
section
had
just
said,
"publishing
or
causing
what
publication
or
dissemination
of
false
material."
what
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
even
though
there
was
a
--
in
your
opinion,
even
though
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
publish
and
disseminate
false
material
for
the
purpose
of
--
of
injuring
their
business,
truckers'
business.
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
we
know
--
how
would
we
know
that
an
article
passed
in
the
reader's
digest
which
reaches
perhaps
30
million
people,
would
not
have
some
adverse
effect
on
their
business
other
than
legislative.

may
i
ask
you
--
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
supposed
it's
all
true,
suppose
every
--
it's
just
a
converse
on
what
i
asked
mr.
price.
suppose
everything
it
said
in
this
article
is
true
when
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
done
by
indirection
be
a
violation
of
the
law?
chief
justice

well,
it
maybe
a

removed

mr.
kohn,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice

where
is
--
where
is
that
did
you
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
27,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kohn,
i
understood
--
i
understood
mr.
price
to
say
that
there
was
absolutely
no
testimony
here
to
indicate
the
false
of
any
of
these
statements.
did
i
misunderstand
him
or
--
chief

don't
disturb
your
(inaudible)

you
may
finish
