how
much
time
did
he
have
to
make
the
claim
within
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
over
three
years.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
said--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
you
said
that
congress
deliberately
chose
not
to.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
so
i'm
going
to
wait
for
that
demonstration
so
i
would
have
to
read
your
--
your
(inaudible)
will
i?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
except
the
statute
of
limit
--
except
that
there's
no
limitation
if
he
can
make
any
claim
at
all.
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
he
has
39
and
a
half
months
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
there
isn't
any
weight
stationed
by
any
provision
of
law
either
he
has
what
he
claims
full
time
within
which
he
can
file
or
review
claims.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
that,
but
not
get
interest
if
he
waits.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'm
saying
is
for
that
--
if
he
can
get
interest
for
any
part
of
the
time,
he
can
get
it
for
all
of
the
time,
because
there's
no
provision
in
the
law
which
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
says
he
can
get
perhaps
two
years
or
one
and
a
half
year
or
is
there?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so,
the
either
it's
all
or
nothing,
he
claims
for
all
or
nothing.
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
nor
is
he
implying
on
--
on
unjust
in
richmond.
you've
been
putting
his
money
to
use
after
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
at
the
very
--
but
there
comes
a
time
wherein
something
was
owing
to
him
from
the
government
for
which
he
could
have
been
there
and
there
sued.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
had
sued,
he
would've
had
interest
from,
if
he
succeeded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
suggesting
you,
the
matter
of
unjust
in
richmond,
you've
used
his
money.
presumably,
the
government
has
also
put
it
out
on
interest
and
so
he
wants
to
have
the
interest
to
which
you're
not
entitled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
that's
true,
but
that
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it
must
be
more
complicated
though
as
--
as
you'd
sit
down
at
this
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
that
would
draw
the
overlapping?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
draw
it.
that
would
draw
into
that
tax
court
proceeding.
