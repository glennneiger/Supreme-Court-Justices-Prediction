mr.
bernard
weiss
may
it
please
the
court.
this
proceeding
is
consigned
with
the
question
in
computing
interest
as
provided
by
law
that
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
claims,
section
2411
(a)
of
title
28
of
the
u.s.
code
section
3771
(e)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939,
which
is
title
26
apply.
it
is
the
--
the
petitioner's
contention
that
section
2411
(a)
govern
since
it
is
contained
in
the
judicial
code,
now
called
title
28,
a
judiciary
into
the
--
under
the
title,
judiciary
and
judicial
procedure
and
the
question
of
determining.
the
interest
on
a
judgment
is
peculiarly
within
the
province
of
the
court
which
is
adjudicating
a
case.
section
2411
(a)
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
judicial
code
dealing
with
interest
in
an
--
with
interest
on
any
overpayment
and
federal
tax,
as
a
result
of
obtaining
a
judgment
to
such
overpayment
in
any
court.
i'm
going
to
read
these
two
sections
which
are
alleged
to
be
in
conflict
and
then
i'll
try
to
distinguish
them
and
show
why.
3771
(e)
never
applies
in
any
case
where
we
run
into
a
situation
where
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
refuses
to
allow
the
claim
for
refund.
that
section
is
only
applicable
when
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
allowed
it.
and
if
he
doesn't
allow,
the
claim
for
refund
within
the
--
those
provisions,
that
section
cannot
be
used.
this
is
an
administrative
proceeding
when
you
say,
“if
the
commissioner
determines.”
he's
not
a
judicial
officer.
therefore,
when
we
use
this
particular
expression,
if
the
commissioner
determines
an
overpayment
in
tax
which
is
attributable
to
an
unused
excess
profits,
credit
carry-back
or
a
net
operating
loss,
credit
carry-back
from
a
subsequent
year,
what
we're
in
effect
saying
is
that
the
commissioner
has
now
made
a
determination.
there
is
no
judgment
of
any
kind
involved
because
when
he
makes
the
determination,
there
isn't
--
the
--
the
taxpayer
is
in
no
position
to
refer
to
the
judicial
code.
and
therefore,
when
the
taxpayer
seeks
to
--
seeks
a
refund,
he
has
to
come
within
the
meaning
of
the
law.
now,
when
the
--
i'm
going
to
read
these
two
sections
and
this
is
what
it
said,
reading
now
2411
(a).
it
says,
“in
any
judgment
of
any
court
rendered
that
(whether
against
the
united
states,
a
collector
or
deputy
collector
of
internal
revenue,
or
the
personal
representative
in
case
of
death)
for
an
overpayment
in
respect
of
any
internal-revenue
tax,
interest
shall
be
allowed
at
the
rate
of
6
per
centum
per
annum
upon
the
amount
of
the
overpayment,
from
the
date
of
the
payment
or
collection
thereof
to
a
date
preceding
the
date
of
the
refund
check
by
not
more
than
30
days,
such
date
to
be
determined
by
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.”
now,
the
language
of
this
particular
provision
of
the
judicial
code
requires
no
further
explanation
than
just
the
words
themselves.
they
speak
for
themselves,
they're
unambiguous.
and
what
does
section
3771
(e)
say?
it
says,
“if
the
commissioner
determines
that
any
part
of
any
overpayment
is
attributable
to
the
inclusion
in
computing
the
net
operating
loss
deduction
for
the
taxable
year
of
any
part
of
the
net
operating
loss
for
succeeding
taxable
year
or
to
the
inclusion
in
computing
the
--
unused
excess
profits
credit
adjustment
for
the
taxable
year
of
any
part
of
the
unused
excess
profits
credit
for
succeeding
taxable
year,
no
interest
shall
be
allowed
or
paid
with
--
with
respect
to
such
part
of
the
overpayment
for
any
period
before
the
filing
of
a
claim
for
credit
or
refund
of
such
part
of
the
over
--
of
the
overpayment
or
the
filing
a
petition
with
the
tax
court,
whichever
is
earlier."
now,
before
i
go
into
discussing
these
two
provisions,
i
want
to
make
a
short
statement
of
what
the
facts
are.
it's
only
one
paragraph
and
we
can
deal
with
that.
march
28th,
1959,
the
petitioner
obtained
a
judgment
in
the
united
states
court
of
claims
against
the
defendant
for
overpayments
of
income
and
excess
profits
taxes
in
the
sum
of
$520,000,
approximately,
when
adjustments
for
interest
as
provided
by
law
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
march
31,
1942
to
march
31,
1946,
inclusive.
this
judgment
included
an
overpayment
of
$211,900
of
excess
profits
tax
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
march
31,
1942
of
which
amount
$150,000
was
attributable
to
an
unused
excess
profits
credit
carry-back
from
the
fiscal
year
ended
march
31,
1943.
the
defendant
in
computing
the
amount
of
interest
on
the
overpayment
of
$150,000
commenced
with
the
date
of
june
14th,
1945,
which
is
the
date
the
claim
for
refund
was
filed
rather
than
march
31st,
1943,
which
is
the
close
of
the
year,
giving
rise
to
the
unused
excess
profits
credit
carry-back
resulting
in
several
payment.
it
is
alleged
that
section
3771
(e)
requires
such
computation.
now,
interest
on
the
rest
of
the
overpayment
in
the
fiscal
year
ended
march
31,
1942
was
properly
computed.
the
court
of
claims
agreed
with
the
basis
of
computation
as
set
forth
by
the
defendant,
but
rendered
no
opinion,
the
taxpayer
petitioned
for
certiorari
and
this
court
rendered
it.
now,
it's
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
language
of
section
2411
(a)
applies
to
any
overpayment
of
federal
tax
which
has
been
determined
by
a
judgment
of
the
court,
except
for
slight
modifications
which
are
not
material
in
this
proceeding.
the
statute
as
it
reads
today
is
the
same
as
it
read
at
that
--
as
it
has
been
since
the
revenue
act
of
1928,
when
it
was
known
as
section
177
of
the
judicial
code.
the
judicial
code
was
incorporated
into
the
u.s.
code
in
1948.
probably,
due
to
some
error,
section
177
or
its
equivalent
or
words
to
the
same
effect,
were
omitted
when
they
--
when
they
merged
the
judicial
code
into
the
u.s.
code.
this
error,
however,
was
corrected
in
may
1949,
when
section
177
(b)
was
put
right
back
into
the
law.
at
the
time
that
they
had
put
in,
when
they
eliminated
section
177,
they
came
in
with
a
section
called
2516,
which
they
thought
might
be
the
equivalent
of
the
old
section
17
--
177.
but
an
examination
of
2516
which
is
shown
in
the
respondent's
brief
in
his
appendix
and
an
--
in
the
next
to
the
last
column
reads,
2516,
“interest
on
claims
and
judgment,
interest
on
claim
against
the
united
states
shall
be
allowed
on
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims
only
under
a
contract
or
act
of
congress
expressly
providing
for
payment
thereof.”
now,
there
are
shortcomings
in
this
particular
section.
it
must
be
obvious,
because
it
only
talks
about
the
court
of
claims.
it
doesn't
mention
anything
about
what
would
happen
if
you
had
a
case
in
the
district
courts.
and
whatever
the
reason
was,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
congress
saw
fit
to
put
it
back
in.
and
at
that
point,
3771
(e),
when
this
would
for
a
particular
provision
now
known
as
2411
(a)
was
put
into
the
code,
section
3771
(e)
was
in
the
code.
and
despite
the
language
of
that
code,
if
there
is
any
alleged
difference
between
the
two
sections
and
we
claim
there
is
none,
we
claim
that
section
3771
(e)
applies
in
--
in
administrative
proceedings
when
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
allows
it.
they
did
not
allow
anything.
in
fact,
they
fought
this
taxpayer
for
a
period
of
14
years
and
refused
to
allow
it.
the
claim
for
refund
based
on
its
excess
profits
credit
carry-back
or
the
two
there
from
the
year
1943
to
the
year
1944.
mr.
bernard
weiss
and
this
is
a
non
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
weiss
that's
right.
mr.
bernard
weiss
oh,
yes.
i
know,
but
we're
now
talking
about
--
we're
talking
about
this
special
provision
which
is
a
limitation.
section
3771
says
that
there's
any
overpayment
of
tax.
now,
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
receive
interest
on
the
overpayment
of
tax
from
the
date
of
overpayment.
it
says
so,
but
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
or
the
defendant
in
this
case
says
that
3771
(e)
prevents
the
taxpayer
from
receiving
interest
from
a
date
prior
to
the
date
that
he
files
his
claim
for
refund.
but
what
does
it
say?
it
says
only
if
the
commissioner
determines
and
allows
it.
it's
only
when
you
allow
it
that
--
that
that
particular
provision
applies.
it's
ridiculous
to
talk
about
applying
a
section
of
law
where
you're
refusing
to
conform
with
the
--
with
the
language
of
the
statute
and
that
is
one
that
--
that
is
the
thing
that
we
claim.
now,
this
question
is
not
an
old
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
they
are
claiming
supremacy
here
of
the
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
section
--
the
internal
revenue
code
over
the
judicial
code.
the
only
time
you
go
into
the
judicial
code
is
because
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
has
refused
to
allow
your
claim.
they
haven't
allowed
it.
now,
you
are
forced
to
go
in
--
go
into
court
and
sue
to
collect
that
which
your
claim
calls
for.
now,
what
does
--
what
--
what
are
--
and
let
--
let's
me
see
whether
we
get
any
help
from
the
internal
revenue
code
itself.
section
37
--
i'm
going
to
read
some
of
these
sections
and
then
we
will
see
whether
we're
coming
in.
section
3770
is
a
section
in
the
code
which
deals
with
the
question
of
making
refunds
or
repayments
to
the
taxpayer
in
the
case
he's
overpaid
his
tax.
3771,
now
that
he's
made
an
overpayment
tax,
deals
with
the
question
of
allowing
him
interest.
now,
when
we
get
into
section
2772
says
that
if
you
can't
get
along
with
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
he's
not
going
to
allow
your
claim,
you
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
sue.
and
what
do
you
have
to
do?
there
are
some
conditions
proceeding
to
sue.
at
the
suit,
you
have
to
put
in
a
--
you
--
have
to
file
a
claim
for
refund.
you
assert
the
basis
on
which
you
claim
your
refund.
in
this
--
that
the
commissioner
was
entitled
to
have
six
months
within
which
to
consider
your
claim.
if
the
commissioner
considers
your
claim
and
allows
it,
then
we
don't
have
to
talk
about
what's
section
2411
(a).
and
if
he
does
allow
it,
then
under
that
expressed
language
of
section
3771
(e),
he
is
entitled
to
--
to
get
--
to
restrict
the
interest
that
the
taxpayer
is
to
receive
from
the
date
of
payment
to
the
date
that
he
files
a
claim
for
refund
and
not
the
date
of
overpayment.
now,
they
seem
to
be
confused.
mr.
bernard
weiss
now,
in
my
claim
--
in
my
claim,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
disallowed
the
claim.
they
denied
that
we
had
an
unused
excess
profits
credit
carry-back.
therefore,
they
can't
talk
about
a
section
which
though
--
and
where
they're
disallowing
your
claim
and
say
that
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
we're
--
we're
going
to
give
you
interest.
if
you
don't
want
to
allow
us
to
claim
and
you
force
me
to
sue,
the
law
rears
that
i'm
now
forced
to
sue,
2411
(a)
says,
that
i
will
receive
interest
on
the
day
--
on
the
amount
of
the
overpayment
from
the
date
of
the
overpayment
to
the
--
to
the
date
of
the
payment,
30
days
before
the
refund
--
before
the
refund
check.
mr.
bernard
weiss
that
is
correct.
now,
this
--
in
this
particular
case,
the
bulova
watch
people
are
not
making
any
claim
for
any
interest
for
a
period
prior
to
the
date
that
the
unused
excess
profits
credit
arises
which
is
at
the
end
of
the
taxable
year.
that's
the
only
thing
that
we
say.
now,
to
help
us
out
in
this
situation,
the
--
the
commissioner
or
the
defendant
cites
a
case,
which
i'm
very
pleased
are
being
decided,
the
seeley
tube.
now,
in
the
first
place,
the
seeley
tube
case
is
not
a
case
involving
a
judgment.
there's
nothing
to
do
with
judgment,
so
that
when
a
taxpayer
comes
in
and
they
allow
the
refund
which
is
what
they
did
in
the
seeley
tube
case,
it
was
proper
for
the
court
to
say
that
the
--
since
the
right
for
the
refund,
only
accrues
at
the
end
of
the
period
giving
lives
to
the
lost.
that
entry
should
not
be
paid
for
any
period
prior
to
that.
now,
what
happened
in
that
seeley
tube
case?
in
the
seeley
tube
case,
the
--
the
taxpayer
had
filed
an
income
tax
return
and
paid
his
tax.
thereafter,
he
--
the
tax
return
was
examined
on
one
of
these
quickie
examinations
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
corporation
had
gone
into
receivership.
the
--
then
the
commissioner
now
asserted
a
tax
--
they
asserted
a
tax
based
on
the
fact
that
the
income
for
that
year
was
--
was
under
--
the
net
income
was
understated
and
therefore,
there
was
an
additional
tax.
the
taxpayer
now
said
that
since
the
net
loss,
operating
loss,
wiped
out
all
of
the
income,
there's
no
tax
due.
and
this
court
properly
stated
that
the
cause
of
action
did
not
arise
until
the
loss
--
until
your
loss
arose
and
therefore
you're
not
entitled
to
(inaudible).
now,
what
is
the
--
where
--
what
is
the
position
of
the
defendant?
the
defendant
says
in
this
particular
case
that
having
--
it
says
that
the
three
--
there
are
three
sections
of
the
--
three
parts
that
would
affect
any
--
well,
that
--
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the
excess
profits
credit
carry-back
is
allowed
on
the
section
710
(c)
of
the
u.s.
internal
revenue
code.
the
section
122
(c)
is
the
net
operating
loss
section,
which
allows
you
to
take
a
subsequent
year's
loss
and
carry
it
--
and
carry
it
back.
and
so
they
say
that
this
is
one
of
the
restraints,
one
of
the
limitations
if
they
allow
the
claim.
that's
true,
if
they
allow
the
claim,
which
they
didn't
do.
and
it's
--
from
now,
the
question
has
come
up.
several
times
before,
whether
or
not,
a
provision
of
the
judicial
code
takes
precedents
over
a
provision
of
the
u.s.
code
that
i
in
my
brief,
in
my
reply
brief
on
page
2
have
sighted
the
bonwit
teller
case.
now,
the
bonwit
teller
case
was
a
case
in
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
that
case
--
that
case
arose
in
this
way,
the
taxpayer
filed
a
claim
for
refund.
they
were
entitled
to
--
they
were
entitled
to
the
--
and
the
commissioner
determines
that
they're
--
they're
entitled
to
an
overassessment.
he
now
signs
a
certificate
of
overassessment.
by
signing
the
certificate
of
overassessment,
section
1116
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
--
of
the
internal
revenue
act
of
1928,
in
effect,
stopped
interest
from
being
paid
for
any
period
of
time
after
the
signing
of
that
certificate
of
overassessment.
but
what
did
the
commissioner
in
fact,
do?
did
he
pay
him
the
money?
no,
he
refused
to
pay
him
the
money.
as
a
result
of
which
the
taxpayer
sued.
the
taxpayer
recovered
the
judgment
in
the
united
states
court
of
claims.
and
the
united
states
court
of
claims,
in
dealing
with
this
particular
section
had
this
to
say,
“that
the
papers
of
section
177
(b)
of
the
judicial
code
has
amended
is,
where
it
is
necessary
for
a
taxpayer
to
bring
a
suit.
so
give
him
interest
upon
amounts
erroneously
collected
as
a
tax
from
the
date
of
its
payment,
then
a
date
preceding
the
date
of
a
check
therefore,
by
not
more
than
30
days.
and
if
swept
aside
any
argument
in
here,
that
the
internal
revenue
provision,
the
precedents
over
the
u.s.
code.”
they
said
when
you
put
--
the
man
--
you're
putting
the
taxpayer
any
expense
of
going
in
there
and
fighting
in
the
courts,
they're
entitled
to
get.
they
are
entitled
to
get
interest
from
(inaudible).
i
think
i'd
better
stop
with
this,
(inaudible)
mr.
bernard
weiss
i
would
like
to
take
a
plot
some
of
these
arguments
that's
been
--
been
advanced
to
you
on
my
behalf.
some
of
the
statements,
i
am
alleged
to
have
made
somewhere
in
my
brief.
if
they'll
find
the
page,
i
want
to
see
it.
now,
in
the
first
place,
they
think
that
i
am
saying
something
in
here
on
section
2411
(a).
i
want
to
call
attention
to
a
particular
way
that
they
are
ignoring,
the
defendant
is
ignoring,
the
word,
thereof.
that's
the
most
important
word
in
that
whole
section
and
they
leave
it
alone.
how
the
taxpayer
--
what
are
you
collecting?
you're
collecting
the
overpayment
thereof
when
the
taxpayer
paid
and
he
wants
to
get
interest,
he's
going
to
get
it
from
the
time
--
from
the
times
that
he
overpaid
the
tax.
now,
when
did
that
period
arrive
in
this
particular
case?
it
arrives
when
the
cause
of
action
arises
and
when
does
the
cause
of
action
arise?
only
at
the
end
of
the
year
of
a
--
excess
profits
tax
year,
which
gave
right
to
the
excess
profits
credit
carry-back.
that's
the
only
term,
there's
no
cause
of
action
previous
that
i
found
and
that's
what
the
taxpayer
is
insisting
on.
we're
not
asking
for
interest
in
the
time
we
paid
it,
why
not?
because
that
wasn't
the
time
that
we
overpaid
it,
it's
the
overpayment
that
counts.
mr.
bernard
weiss
no,
sir.
mr.
bernard
weiss
no,
sir.
the
--
the
section
3771
is
not
the
determining
to
your
--
the
overpayment.
mr.
bernard
weiss
the
--
the
(inaudible)
the
overpayment
is
being
--
just
a
minute,
the
overpayment
as
being
determined
by
the
fact
that
section
710
(c)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
allows
you
a
carry-back.
that's
--
that's
the
section
that
allows
it
and
that's
the
reason
that
they
--
that
--
that
they're
giving
it
to
us.
they're
not
giving
us
anything
here
that
we're
not
entitled
to
receive.
normally,
it's
the
taxpayer
requesting
it.
in
this
case,
we're
not
requesting
anything.
everybody
that
sues
the
government
whose
--
and
recovers
a
judgment,
they're
all
treated
alike.
anytime
you
have
a
claim
before
the
--
the
commissioner
and
if
he
allows
it,
he
gets
the
benefits.
he
can
restrict
your
interest
and
make
a
--
and
gain
by
allowing
you
your
claim,
which
he's
refusing
to
do.
for
14
years,
he
hit
those
taxpayers
by
over
pillar
of
boats.
they'd
--
they
went
around
on
there,
they
did
it
like
--
what
they're
using
in
here
is
using
a
--
a
hatchet
and
they're
trying
to
tell
the
man
he's
got
--
that
he's
smelling
beautiful
flowers.
that's
what
--
that's
what
going
on
here
in
--
in
this
particular
thing.
now,
they
pulled
all
sorts
of
cases
in
here
that
have
no
applicability
whatsoever.
every
time
they
cite
a
case
over
here,
it's
when
the
cause
of
action
arises.
they
come
in
here,
they
give
you
section
7
of
the
technical
changes
act
of
1949
as
if
that's
got
something
to
do
for
the
proposition
that
we
have
before
this
court.
the
taxpayer
--
the
section
7
of
the
technical
changes
act
of
1949,
they
so
--
they
cite
four
cases
here
with
regards.
that's
--
let's
take
--
let's
care
of
those
four
cases.
the
--
that
provision
was
put
in,
in
order
to
remedy
what
appeared
to
be
an
outrageous
tax
that
was
being
illustrated
against
to
the
decedent,
who
was
being
taxed
on
a
theory
that
citing
property
which
he
had
transferred
might
conceivably
come
back
to
him.
and
therefore,
they
taxed
him
irrespective
(inaudible).
how
minute
that
refers
here
--
who
--
minute
the
value
was
this
proportion
of
re-interest,
so
they
came
in
and
they
now
put
into
the
court.
they
--
they
passed
an
act
in
which
they
said
that
they
were
going
to
give
relief.
so
7
(a)
provides
that
any
person
who
paid
a
tax
on
the
basis
of
a
reversionary
interest
which
was
less
than
5%
of
the
value
of
the
property
on
the
date
--
on
the
day
before
the
date
of
that.
that
that
--
that
person
could
get
a
--
could
a
refund
of
his
tax.
what?
they've
put
in
a
further
condition
that
you
can
--
but
you
in
fact,
you'll
get
your
tax
back
but
you
wouldn't
get
interest.
now,
why
is
that?
because
in
the
years
to
which
the
tax
applied,
there
was
no
overpayment,
not
according
to
the
way
the
law
read.
the
law
read
in
a
given
way.
this
--
this
--
the
possibility
of
refutative
was
just
another
of
--
of
a
reversionary
interest
coming
back
to
the
(inaudible),
was
just
enough
to
be
able
to
tax
into
that
--
state
that
thing.
so
therefore,
your
cause
of
action
didn't
arise
until
1949,
so
therefore,
when
you're
giving
back
people
money,
you
can
only
stop
in
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
and
that's
what
it
says.
now,
when
they
come
in
here
and
they're
--
they
--
they
quote
a
case
in
here
which
is
odd
basic.
they
--
they're
giving
you
this
case
called
graham
versus
goodcell.
now,
just
imagine
that
anybody
quoting
a
case
like
the
graham
versus
goodcell.
now,
what
is
the
graham
versus
goodcell
case
about?
the
graham
versus
goodcell
case
where
--
goes
back
to
revenue
act
of
1924
in
20
years,
at
that
time,
we
had
a
provision
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
if
an
assessment
is
placed
on
the
books
by
the
commission
that
he
has
to
go
out
and
collect
that
assessment
within
five
years
of
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
return.
somebody
and
a
few
--
if
the
commissioner
is
now
assessing
the
tax,
the
taxpayer
wants
to
complain
about
the
facts,
they
gave
him
a
provision.
they
put
in
that
he
could
ask
for
a
--
they
could
file
the
claim
in
abatement
of
this
tax.
at
the
same
time,
he
did
that,
the
--
in
most
cases,
they'd
ask
you
to
put
up
some
sort
of
a
bond
and
at
the
same
time,
the
taxpayer
would
go
off
and
get
a
stay
of
--
so
that
the
collector
of
internal
revenue
wouldn't
go
and
collect
this
tax.
now,
what
do
these
people
do?
they
got
the
bright
idea
that
they
could
hold
this
case
long
enough.
the
statute
would
expire
while
the
stay
is
on
and
the
--
and
the
collector
wouldn't
be
able
to
collect
the
tax.
now,
what
--
why
--
so
they
now
said,
"we
don't
owe
you
the
tax."
and
then
loads
and
loads
of
taxpayers
got
this
--
this
marvelous
idea
of
how
to
beat
the
government
out
of
the
tax.
and
so
they
--
with
all
these
delays
that
were
--
that
they
--
they
just
file
without
paying
the
tax.
now,
there
is
a
section
in
the
law
that
in
this
1928
code
which
prove
--
at
1928
internal
revenue
act,
which
said,
“that
an
overpayment
of
tax,
if
you
made
a
payment
to
the
government
with
respect
to
any
assessed
tax
after
the
statute
of
limitation
arose,
you
got
an
overpayment
from
tax
and
therefore,
if
you
filed
a
claim,
you
will
be
able
to
get
--
to
get
a
refund.”
so
everybody
had
to
file.
they
thought
that
this
was
a
great
idea.
when
the
commissioner
got
wise
to
this
thing,
what
did
they
do?
the
commissioner
went
out
there
and
they
seize
people's
properties,
they
foreclosed
all
the
funds.
they
did
all
that
sort
of
thing.
and
on
top
of
that,
now,
they
went
to
the
congress
and
they
got
themselves
an
act
in
there
which
said,
“that
wherever
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
assessed
a
tax
and
the
taxpayer
had
filed
a
--
a
claim
for
credit
and
had
gotten
the
advantage
of
a
--
of
a
state,
then
thereafter,
any
payment
made
after
the
statute
of
limitations
under
those
circumstances
that
that
constitute
an
overpayment.”
now,
what
happens
to
the
taxpayer?
he
has
no
--
has
no
place
to
go.
he
can't
--
he
can't
recover
because
the
very
act
which
gave
him
the
right
to
fit
--
fit
the
payment
there
for
the
statute
of
limitations
as
a
--
overpayment
was
now
destroyed.
he
--
he
--
they
took
it
away
from
him.
now,
what
does
this
got
to
do
with
us
in
this
particular
case?
i
don't
know.
but
this
is
one
of
the
cases
that
they
have
used
to
try
to
establish
their
point
and
they
talked
about
equity.
got
to
help
the
people
that
have
to
rely
on
equities,
when
they
took
this
taxpayer
and
hit
him
over
the
lot
and
then
--
then
--
i'm
now
talking
about
a
--
an
equitable
piece
of
legislation.
we've
got
some
more
or
i'd
be
back
here
again
on
--
mr.
bernard
weiss
--
on
the
same
subject
of
interest.
mr.
bernard
weiss
oh,
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
weiss
well,
i
--
and
then
i
say,
we're
don't
have
time
--
and
all
that
i'm
saying
in
here
is
this.
that
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
what
the
law
gives
him.
it's
rare
enough
that
we
--
that
the
taxpayer
can
actually
get
money
from
the
government.
so
when
you
--
when
they
--
when
they
owe
you
money
and
the
law
permits
you
to
receive
this
money,
i
think
the
thing
to
do
is
go
and
collect.
and
we're
not
asking
for
non-reasonable
thing
here.
i
think
they
have
tried
to
present
this
in
a
way
that
if
any
--
he
who
runs
can
understand
the
case.
and
i
believe
that
the
taxpayer
--
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
reversed
and
that
interest
should
be
allowed
to
this
taxpayer
in
the
date
of
the
payment
to
the
--
to
the
date,
30
days
before
the
refund
check.
thank
you
very
much.
