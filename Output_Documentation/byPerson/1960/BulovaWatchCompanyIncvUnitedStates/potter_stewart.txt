justice
potter
stewart
well
obviously,
mr.
davis,
it
is,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
relying
--
you
can't
be
relying
on
the
literal
language
of
3771
(e)
either.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
because
at
the
very
four
words.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
--
is
that
--
quite
right.
you
have
a
general
statute
giving
6%
interest
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
time
of
judgment.
now,
doesn't
the
burden
fall
on
you
to
show
that
for
--
for
some
reasons,
some
special
statute
is
an
exception
to
that
general
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
regardless
of
all
the
history
to
be
sure,
interest
was
thrown
down
against
the
government
of
common
law
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
but
now,
congress
has
enacted
a
general
statute
of
general
application
applying
the
tax
refund
claim
saying
the
judgment
of
6%
shall
run.
and
now
--
and
that
certainly
is
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
general
applicability.
now,
isn't
it
up
to
him
and
says
there's
something
peculiar
about
this
kind
of
a
tax
refund
claim
to
show
that
that
general
statute
shall
not
be
applicable?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
the
burden
there
rather
than
where
you
seek
through
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
could
he
have
gone
to
the
tax
court?
i
just
want
to
be
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
for
--
for
what
year?
justice
potter
stewart
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
there
any
disagreement
between
you
as
to
what
you
just
told
us
about
the
fact
that
he
could've
gone
to
the
tax
court
without
question?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
developed
in
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
that
might
--
wouldn't
necessarily
arise
in
a
way
that
this
you
say,
could
have
arisen
by
a
--
on
a
--
on
a
deficiency
assessment
on
an
ordinary
income
tax.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
either
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
some
areas
of
course,
but
on
a
proposed
deficiency
in
income
tax
whether
or
not
that
opens
up
all
the
person's
excess
profits.
justice
potter
stewart
indeed,
the
tax
--
the
tax
court
is
the
final
--
the
final
court
on
excess
profits
tax
type
to
the
question
of
most
kinds.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
this
claim
did,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
income
taxes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
did
not.
justice
potter
stewart
he
did
not.
the
actual
claim
filed
in
the
court
of
claims
did
not
result
from
any
deficiency
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
go
ahead.
