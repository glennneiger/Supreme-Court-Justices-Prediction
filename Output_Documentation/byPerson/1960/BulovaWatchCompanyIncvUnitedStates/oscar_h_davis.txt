mr.
oscar
h.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
interest
case.
it's
a
case
that
involves
the
question
of
how
much
interest
is
payable
on
a
refund
judgment.
and
the
interest
is
not
after
the
judgment
has
been
rendered,
but
from
what
time
the
interest
should
be
computed
in
the
past.
it
arises
in
the
context
and
the
--
the
reason
for
the
--
its
arising
is
the
fact
that
there
are
two
separate
provisions
of
the
federal
laws
which
are
said
to
be
applicable.
the
petitioner
says
that
section
2411
of
the
judicial
code
as
he
says,
if
you
just
read
on
its
face,
something
that
we
do
not
agree.
that
if
you
read
it
on
its
face,
it
holds
in
his
--
it
--
it
rules
his
case.
we
say
that
3771
(e)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
is
precisely
applicable
here.
now,
why
--
why
does
this
case
raise
a
problem?
it
raises
a
problem
in
particular,
because
you
have
to
tell
what
the
interrelationship
of
these
two
provisions
of
the
federal
legislation
is.
and
in
our
mind,
it
raises
a
problem,
a
second
problem
because
it
is
quite
clear
that
this
taxpayer
could
have
sought
the
route
of
going
through
the
tax
court
and
--
if
he
wanted
to
or
if
the
taxpayer
had
wanted
to.
and
in
that
case,
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
3771
(e),
which
is
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
government's
brief,
would
have
been
applicable
and
that
is
that
the
--
the
limited
interest
for
which
we
contend
and
which
the
court
of
claims
allowed
in
this
case,
would
have
been
the
only
one
allowed.
he
did
not
do
so.
i
mean
the
taxpayer
did
not
do
so.
it
paid
the
tax
and
then
sued
for
a
refund
and
it
claims
that
because
it
did
--
it
took
the
route
of
paying
the
taxes
and
suing
for
a
refund,
it's
entitled
to
more
interest
than
if
it
had
gone
through
the
other
procedure
of
going
to
the
tax
court.
i
think
i
also
--
also
want
to
say
before
launching
into
the
burden
of
my
argument.i
want
to
spell
out
a
little
bit
perhaps
more
for
the
court,
precisely
what
kind
of
--
of
taxes
are
involved
here.
there
is
no
doubt
that
when
the
--
the
tax
here
involved
is
the
one
ending,
march
31st,
1942
--
march
31st,
1942.
there
is
no
claim
that
the
taxes
which
were
assessed
and
to
--
and
collected
in
1942
for
that
year
were
in
any
way
illegal
or
erroneous
or
improper
as
of
the
time
they
were
assessed
or
collected.
there
was
no
such
claim.
what
it
--
it
said
is
that
congress,
in
allowing
the
carry-back
provisions
which
the
court
has
had
in
several
cases,
said
that
if
at
the
end
of
the
next
succeeding
year,
march
31st,
1943,
the
taxpayer
discovers
that
he
has
an
unused
excess
profits
credit
applicable
to
the
excess
profits
tax
of
world
war
ii,
which
he
hasn't
had
to
use
for
that
year,
he
can
carry
it
back
and
alter
or
change
his
tax
for
the
year
1942.
and
that
--
and
he
has
that
right
under
the
statute
and
that
was
done
in
this
case.
and
that
his
claim
is
that
when
he
does
that,
when
he
carries
it
back
by
grace
of
congress,
therefore,
he
is
entitled
to
interest
from
the
government,
interest
from
--
not
from
the
time
he
makes
his
claim
that
he
should
be
allowed
the
carry-back,
but
from
the
time
that
he
says
the
--
the
right
to
make
this
carry-back
arose,
march
31st,
1943.
now,
the
answer
we
think
and
i'll
try
to
spell
that
in
some
more
detail,
is
that
congress
deliberately
chose
not
to
make
the
interest
run
from
that
period.
that
it
deliberately
chose
to
say,
“interest
shall
not
run
until
you
make
your
claim
for
refund
which
this
taxpayer
didn't
do
the
two
years
later.
the
difference
is
the
tax
between
march
31st,
1943
when
the
claim
could
have
been
made
and
june
14th,
1945,
a
little
over
two
years
later,
when
the
claim
was
actually
made.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
over
three
years.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
some
--
some
--
quite
a
long
period.
and
that
mr.
justice
is
why
congress
deliberately
chose
as
the
--
as
senate
report
shows
to
say
interest
will
not
run
until
you
make
your
claim
in
--
in
putting
section
3771
(e)
into
the
statute.
they
were
aware
of
this
problem
and
the
senate
report
says
“we
want
to
require
prompt
filing
of
refund
claims
and
therefore
we
will
not
allow
interest
to
run
until
that
has
occurred.”
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
if
you
will
turn
the
--
perhaps
and
anticipating
the
--
page
16
of
our
brief,
mr.
justice.
you
will
see
the
senate
report
and
in
the
middle
of
it,
they're
talking
about
carry-backs
there
and
they're
talking
about
this
section
which
was
put
into
the
code
on
which
we
rely,
3771
(e).
and
they
say
there,
“he
must
therefore
file
his
return
and
pay
his
tax
without
regard
to
such
deduction,”
that's
the
carry-back
deduction.
“and
must
file
a
claim
for
refund
at
the
close
of
succeeding
year,
when
he's
able
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
carry-back.”
then
they
go
on,
“inasmuch
as
any
overpayment
resulting
from
the
deduction
of
such
carry-back
does
not
occur
as
a
practical
matter
until
the
net
operating
loss
or
the
unused
excess
profits
credit
and
the
future
taxpayer
has
determined
and
inasmuch
as
it
is
desirable
to
ensure
promptness
in
the
filing
of
claims
to
inform
the
commissioner
that
such
deductions
have
been
determined,
this
section
provide
that
no
interest
will
be
allowed
with
respect
to
any
such
overpayment
for
any
period
before
the
claim
therefore
is
filed,
or
a
petition
asserting
such
overpayment
is
filed
with
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
now
the
tax
court,
whichever
is
earlier."
so,
would
they
adverted
to
this
precise
problem
and
they
their
made
a
choice.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
what
the
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
petitioner
has
not
said,
but
we
--
we
figure
he
has
about
three
years
or
--
or
--
quite
a
long
time.
he
--
he
took
actually
two
years
and
two
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
and
two
months
in
which
to
do
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
has
not
stated
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
has
not
said
anything.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
we
figured
out
to
be
as
39
and
a
half
months.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
from
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
no.
we
--
we
don't
deny
that
he
has
the
full
--
the
right
to
--
to
wait
to
39
and
a
half
months.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
that's
what
congress
said.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
perhaps
that
was
quite
out
of
--
out
of
the
order
of
my
argument.
i
should
say
right
at
this
moment
that
though
the
taxpayer
has
not
indicated
to
the
court,
he
is
not
relying
on
the
literal
words
of
section
2411
which
is
the
section
in
the
judicial
code
printed
in
our
brief
at
3
and
4.
because
that
section
says
that
the
--
interest
--
it's
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
the
government's
brief.
it
says,
“interest
shall
be
allowed
at
the
rate
of
6
per
centum
per
annum
on
the
amount
of
the
overpayment
from
the
date
of
the
payment
or
collection
thereof.
now,
he
paid
these
taxes
in
1942
and
if
you
take
those
words
in
the
ordinary
sense
in
which
they
have
any
meaning
to
people
in
the
english
language
or
that
they
have
the
meaning
in
the
--
in
the
tax
law.
he
paid
the
tax
in
1942,
because
that's
when
he
paid
the
tax.
but
he
isn't
claiming
that
he
is
entitled
to
interest
from
that
time,
because
he
knows
it
would
be
absurd
to
do
so.
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
claim
that
even
though
there
was
nothing
wrong
at
the
time
he
paid
the
tax
as
far
as
the
government
was
concerned,
even
though
the
events
had
not
come
into
existence,
made
the
carry-back
provision
proper
and
would
not
come
into
existence
until
a
year
later,
march
31st,
1943,
a
year
after
that
the
tax
--
the
--
the
end
of
the
tax
year
with
which
we're
concerned.
he
says
that
he
is
limiting
his
claim
for
refund
to
the
end
of
that
succeeding
year.
all
i
wish
to
point
out
now
here,
is
that
he
is
not
relying
on
the
--
on
the
words
of
2411,
of
course
if
he
did,
he
would
be
claiming
interest
back
to
a
period
before
the
any
of
the
events
that
occurred
which
made
the
carry-back
--
which
brought
the
carry-back
into
existence.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
oh,
no.
that
--
that
i
will
try
to
develop
too
as
that
precisely
what
--
what
hasn't
been
happening
here,
because
this
is
not
something
where
there
was
an
illegal
attack
at
the
very
beginning.
this
is
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
congress
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
he
would
have
to
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
but
congresses
has
said
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
no.
but
congress
has
said
in
the
1939
--
in
the
1942
act
which
is
the
one
involved
here.
and
i
should
say
that
all
of
this
arises
under
the
1939
code,
because
the
1954
code
did
change
the
provision.
this
arises
under
the
1939
code.
and
congress
did
say
as
i
pointed
out
deliberately
that
until
he
brings
to
the
commissioner's
attention,
the
facts
which
show
that
there
has
been
an
overpayment
on
his
part,
he
isn't
entitled
to
any
of
these.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
no.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i'm
--
i'm
--
well,
but
i'm
--
i'm
trying
to
go
back
and
i
will
try
to
go
back
now
and
to
state
my
--
what
i
want
to
do
is
to
clear
the
ground
from
some
of
what
i
think
some
of
the
--
the
provisions
here
which
cannot
be
applied
on
their
phase.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
what
the
problem
really
is,
is
that
you
have
these
two
provisions
i
set
at
the
beginning,
which
have
to
be
integrated.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no.
it's
--
it's
a
different
problem
in
two
respects
from
the
carter
case,
mr.
justice
douglas.
one
is
that
in
that
case,
the
tax
when
it
was
collected
was
erroneous
and
illegal
at
that
time
it
was
collected,
so
that
the
carter
case
is
different
in
that
very
important
respect.
and
the
second
thing
in
which
the
carter
case
is
different
is
that
in
the
carter
case,
related
to
excess
--
excise
taxes
in
which
there
was
not
the
double
rule
applying
either
through
the
tax
court
or
through
the
--
the
court
of
claims
in
the
district
court.
and
one
of
the
points
of
our
--
of
our
argument
is
that
congress
has
been
trying
to
equate
as
--
at
least
as
between
people
who
go
through
the
tax
court
and
people
who
go
through
the
court
of
claims
of
the
district
court,
the
provisions
were
interest,
since
interest
was
first
allowed
in
1921.
neither
those
two
factors
was
--
was
present
in
the
--
in
the
carter
case
in
1938.
but
if
i
may
go
back
and
state
more
generally,
our
--
we
have
two
general
positions.
first,
the
broader
one
and
which
is
that
2411
of
the
code
is
a
general
proscription
and
that
there
are
qualifications
and
exceptions
to
it
which
are
found
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
that
is
that
the
--
these,
the
provisions
have
to
be
read
together
as
if
they
were
an
integrated
body
of
law.
and
though
they
appear
in
different
provisions
of
the
code,
they
are
part
of
a
single
whole
and
that
the
provision
which
we're
concerned
with,
3771
(e),
is
a
specific
qualification
and
exception.
and
that
unless
something
is
found
in
the
--
in
the
wording
of
the
particular
provision,
it
should
be
applied
whether
the
case
is
one
that
goes
through
the
tax
court
or
one
that
goes
through
the
--
the
district
courts
or
the
court
of
claims
to
the
refund
method
of
procedure.
and
in
general,
we
would
say
that
the
specific
restrictive
interest
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
in
which
there
are
a
number.
someone
has
counted
15,
of
--
of
various
kinds
are
applicable,
whichever
way
the
taxpayer
brings
--
seeks
judicial
review
of
his
--
of
his
proceeding.
that
is
through
the
tax
court
or
through
the
court
of
claims
of
the
district
court
unless
there
is
some
specific
reason
to
think
that
that
particular
specific
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
should
not
be
applicable
as
a
qualification
or
exception
to
2411
of
the
judicial
code.
and
the
more
particular
position
which
we
have
which
i've
already
stated
in
part,
rests
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
--
an
unused
excess
profits
tax
carry-back.
that
is
even
though
as
it
--
and
there
maybe
other
provision
--
other
restrictive
interest
provisions
which
are
not
applicable
under
2411
that
is
when
suit
is
in
the
court
of
claims.
this
provision
is
applicable
because
of
its
history
to
which
i've
averted,
the
senate
committee
that
they
deliberately
wished
to
start
interest
only
from
a
certain
time,
because
its
purpose
was
to
require
the
prompt
filing
of
refund
claims
which
would
not
--
which
would
be
frustrated
if
the
petitioner's
view
of
interest
would
be
allowed.
and
because
of
the
other
factor
that
i've
mentioned
that
is
consistent
effort
by
congress
to
get
--
to
attain
equality
as
in
interest
matters,
as
between
taxpayers
who
seek
review
through
the
commissioner
and
then
onto
the
tax
court
and
court
of
appeals
and
possibly
this
court,
and
those
other
taxpayers
who
pay
the
tax
and
make
--
and
--
and
make
refunds.
but
there's
been
a
consistent
history,
we
believe,
of
an
effort
to
attain
equality
as
between
those
--
those
two
sets
of
taxpayers.
i
should
say
a
word
to
because
i
think
it
is
relevant
about
the
fact
that
this
is
an
interest
case
because
from
the
beginning
of
--
of
anglo-saxons
jurisprudence
on
this
subject.
and
certainly
in
this
country,
interest
has
been
looked
at
with
a
very
severe
eye
with
respect
to
claims
against
the
government.
interest
does
not
--
it
was
not
allowed
at
common
law
on
claims
against
the
government,
when
the
court
of
claims
was
established
as
a
tribunal
for
the
settlement
of
claims
against
the
government.
in
the
1860's,
congress
provided
that
unless
there
was
a
specific
provision
to
the
contrary,
specific
provision,
interest
was
not
to
be
allowed
prior
to
judgment
in
a
suit
against
the
government.
and
--
and
this
court
has
applied
that
rule
as
mr.
justice
brandeis
said,
“rigorously.”
and
this,
we
think
is
--
and
they've
applied
it
in
--
in
income
tax
cases.
there
was
no
interest
against
the
government
in
income
tax
cases
either
administratively
or
in
--
in
court
cases
until
1921.
now,
it's
true
you
could
sue
the
collector
and
get
interest
against
him,
but
the
court
early
held
that
when
you
sued
the
collector
and
got
a
judgment
against
him
and
then
you
didn't
go
around
to
the
treasury
and
file
your
certificate
of
probable
cause
for
years
--
to
the
years
later,
you
didn't
get
interest
on
the
judgment
from
the
time
you've
got
the
judgment
against
the
collector
because
the
court
said,
“when
you
turned
it
into
a
claim
against
the
government,
the
usual
rule
providing
against
payment
of
interest
was
applicable.”
now,
i
mentioned
these
general
principles
because
--
i
should
even
say
that
when
--
when
congress
and
statutes
has
said
that
that
there
is
--
just
compensation
shall
be
allowed
on
a
claim
in
a
non-eminent
domain
context.
just
compensation
which
are
words
which
in
eminent
domain
cases
clearly
involves
interest,
the
court
has
said
that
just
because
congress
used
the
word
“just
compensation,”
does
not
mean
interest
is
allowable
prior
to
judgment.
that
--
that
congress
has
to
be
more
specific.
now,
all
of
these
body
of
law
we
think
is
important,
because
we
think
that
it
puts
upon
the
taxpayer
the
burden
of
showing
specifically
that
congress
intended
that
he
obtained
the
interest
which
he
seeks
in
a
--
in
a
case.
it's
not
this
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
perhaps
in
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
we
think
the
history
does
indicate
that
even
in
this
situation,
it's
up
to
the
taxpayer
to
show
that
--
that
the
section
should
be
applied
as
he
says
it
should
be
applied.
and
i
would
point
out
again,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
he
doesn't
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
seek
to
apply
it
in
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
because
he
--
i
think
because
he
thinks
have
lead
to
an
absurd
result,
so
he
seeks
to
--
to
modify
that
thing.
but
even
on
the
assumption
that
you
make
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
perhaps
one
--
one
of
the
ways
i
can
be
helpful
is
to
say
--
is
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
provision
on
interest
in
overpayments
in
the
judicial
code
which
is
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
starts
out
with
a
general
statement,
“interest
shall
be
allowed
and
paid
upon
any
overpayment
in
respect
of
any
internal
revenue
tax
at
the
rate
of
6
per
centum
per
annum.”
now,
it
doesn't
say
there
except
as
otherwise
provided
or
anything
else.
it's
a
general
provision.
later
on
in
the
same
section,
congress
provided
that
in
the
case
of
the
type
we
have
here,
interest
should
be
more
restrictive
than
the
general
provision
at
the
beginning
of
section
3771.
now,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
in
1942,
when
congress
added
the
restrictive
provision
on
which
we
rely
(e),
3771
(e),
if
it
--
if
in
1942,
it
added
that
as
another
part
of
the
internal
revenue
code
or
as
a
separate
statute
or
perhaps
even
if
they
put
it
in
to
the
judicial
code,
that
you
would
have
to
read
them
altogether
because
they
relate
--
all
relate
to
--
to
taxes
and
so
we
think
it
does
make
any
difference
here
that
there
is
this
general
provision
of
2411
in
the
judicial
code
that
you
have
to
when
you're
--
when
you're
dealing
with
interest
on
--
in
tax
matters,
look
throughout
the
body
of
federal
tax
law
to
see
whether
there
are
any
exceptions
to
--
to
this
general
statute.
and
here
we
say
you
find
a
--
a
section
which
we
think
it
is
applicable
in
its
terms
and
which
congress
desired
should
be
applicable
here.
so
we
--
what
i'm
really
saying
i
think
is
that
you
can't
look
at
these
as
desperate
or
discreet
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
law.
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
interest
provisions
of
the
internal
--
of
the
internal
revenue
legislation
whether
they
appear
in
the
internal
revenue
code
or
whether
they
appear
in
the
judicial
code
or
in
a
separate
statute
as
a
body
of
law.
and
just
as
you
would
do
with
any
body
of
law,
you
then
organize
them
to
see
whether
there
isn't
a
general
provision
and
exceptions
to
it.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
that
i
think
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
his
whole
case
is
that
if
--
if
what
i
--
i'll
try
to
answer
that
by
saying
that
congress
didn't
make
a
distinction
between
the
taxpayer
who
goes
to
the
tax
court.
this
payment
in
a
sense
wasn't
--
this
--
this
taxpayer
could
have
gone
to
the
tax
court,
there's
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
he
could've
gone
to
the
tax
court,
i
think.
and
--
and
if
he
had
gone
to
the
tax
court
to
--
to
test
the
deficiency
which
the
commissioner
says,
he
then
would've
gotten
a
--
a
decision
of
an
overpayment,
which
would've
been
paid
for
the
interest
only
under
subsection
(e).
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
the
commissioner
assessed
deficiency.
see
this
--
the
excess
profits
taxes
and
the
income
taxes
of
--
for
the
year
1942
were
correlative.
that
is
the
higher
your
one
was,
the
lower
the
other
one
was.
and
so
when
the
commissioner
assessed
the
deficiency
against
him,
that
necessary
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
for
--
for
1952
--
1942,
i'm
sorry,
i
may
not
say
1952.
for
1942
that
necessarily
meant
that
the
other
--
that
commissioner
did
assess
a
deficiency
against
him
in
regular
income
taxes.
he
could've
gone
to
the
tax
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
on
that
deficiency.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that
would've
opened
up
the
whole
thing.
and
there's
some
specific
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
says
that
the
tax
court
can
consider
whether
the
deficiency
exists
for
that
year
or
whether
there's
an
overpayment
for
that
year
and
it
can
determine
what
the
overpayment
is.
and
if
there
has
been
an
overpayment,
this
overpayment
shall
be
refunded
by
the
commissioner.
now
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
pardon
me?
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this,
yes.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
and
if
had
gone
to
the
tax
court
on
--
on
this
claim,
then
3771
(e)
would
clearly
have
been
applicable.
in
fact
it
ends
by
saying
that
the
interest
starts
running
at
the
filing
of
a
petition
with
the
tax
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
know
because
i
--
i
think
that
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
nothing
--
it's
nothing
developed,
but
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
it
could
have
been.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
anyway,
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
congress
quite
clearly
decided
when
it
added
subsection
(e)
that
the
tax
court
was
--
was
a
--
an
appropriate
vehicle
in
most
of
the
cases,
because
it
provided
that
interest
shall
stop
when
--
when
a
petition
was
filed
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
it
could
have
arisen
in
one
several
ways.
in
whichever
way
it
arose,
there
was
a
probability.
i
can't
really
say
to
you
that
it
could
occur
in
every
single
case,
but
there
was
a
broad
probability
that
these
--
that
these
provisions
could
go
--
i
mean
the
--
the
claims
of
this
type
could
go
to
the
tax
court,
as
well
as
through
the
refund
system.
and
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
--
i'm
not
enough
with
the
tax
law
--
lawyer,
mr.
justice
whittaker
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
not
--
i
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
well,
i
think
that
is
clear.
i
think
that
is
clear,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
sir,
other
kinds.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
now,
i
think
that's
clear.
the
one
thing
i'm
not
clear
is
whether
this
kind
of
a
--
a
claim
by
a
petitioner
like
this
could
arise
without
a
deficiency
occurring.
and
--
and
in
--
in
a
particular
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
this
claim
arose
as
a
result
of
a
deficiency.
that
--
that
is
the
--
the
commissioner
assessed
additional
taxes
for
the
year
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
income
taxes
and
he
could
have
gone
to
the
--
to
the
tax
court
saying
there
was
no
deficiency
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
--
of
the
time
when
it's
overpaid.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
no,
because
he
paid
the
tax.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
because
he
paid
the
tax.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
think
that
is
correct.
but
i
would
say
--
because
you
mentioned
the
term
article
iii
court
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
and
this
is
an
answer
i
think
also
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
at
the
beginning
of
the
--
of
subsection
(e),
says,
“if
the
commissioner
determines.”
now
i
don't
think
that
can
be
read
literally
because
clearly,
if
he
goes
--
if
the
taxpayer
goes
to
the
tax
court,
the
tax
court
which
is
not
the
commissioner
who
determines
that
there
was
an
overpayment,
the
interest
provisions
of
--
of
subsection
(e)
would
apply.
similarly,
if
the
tax
court
were
held
against
him
and
he
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
ultimately
to
this
court
which
are
article
iii
courts
--
and
courts
and
they
held
that
there
was
a
--
an
overpayment
which
--
for
which
he
is
entitled
a
refund,
3771
(e)
would
apply.
i
think
his
basic
argument
is
not
that
it's
an
article
iii
court
versus
a
--
a
non-article
iii
court,
but
it's
a
refund
suit
versus
the
--
the
tax
court
deficiency
rule
and
i
think
that
his
basis.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
it's
a
decision.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
yes.
but
--
but
at
this
--
but
on
--
on
review
by
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
tax
court
had
decided
against
the
petitioner
on
this
repayment
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
reversed,
there
would
surely
be
a
judgment
order.
and
undoubtedly
i
think,
3771
(e)
would
apply
in
that
situation.
so,
i
don't
think
that
any
meaningful
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
the
two
different
methods
of
--
of
testing
the
commissioner's
refusal
to
pay
the
--
of
that
instant.
now,
i
would
like
to
pay
--
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
--
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
before
my
time
elapses
that
this
commissioner
has
recovered
interest
from
--
i
think
it's
june
1945,
through
april
1959,
when
he
received
the
check.
so
he
--
he
has
recovered
interest
of
--
for
14
years
at
6%.
mr.
oscar
h.
davis
i
don't
really
know,
mr.
justice
brennan.
they
were
--
there
--
he
didn't
file
his
petition
in
the
court
of
claims
until
1953.
and
then
because
--
unfortunately,
the
--
the
statute
of
limitations
says
that
he
has
--
if
the
commissioner
doesn't
disallow
a
claim,
you
just
go
on
forever.
i
mean
the
statute
of
limitations
doesn't
begin
to
run
until
the
commissioner
disallows
the
claim.
and
the
commission
never
got
around
to
disallowing
these
particular
claims,
so
he
didn't
have
to
bring
his
suit
until
1953
in
the
court
of
claims
and
then
it
proceeded
along
in
ordinary
course.
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
he
has
received
interest
at
6%
from
that
time
and
he
--
what
he's
claiming
---
and
this
interest
is
a
desirable
amount
of
money
that
the
--
the
actual
principal
involved
is
i
think
about
$150,000
and
he's
already
gotten
$124,000
in
interest
on
this
--
on
that
principal.
and
he's
claiming
another
$23,000
for
the
two-year
difference
between
march
31st,
1942
and
june
14th,
1945.
and
to
grant
interest
for
this
prior
period
is
really
to
say
that
the
government
should
be
penalized
because
he
--
he
saw
his
contest
through
the
court
of
claims
rather
than
through
the
tax
court.
and
this
is
contrary
to
some
--
to
--
to
all
the
legislation
not
only
on
this
field,
but
in
other
fields.
congress
has
never
sought
to
penalize
the
government
in
--
in
this
respect.
and
as
i
--
as
i
pointed
out
before,
again,
because
this
taxpayer
sued
in
the
court
of
claims,
he
can
set
--
talk
about
delay.
if
he'd
gone
through
the
tax
court
mechanism,
there
may
have
been
the
same
amount
of
delay,
but
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
make
the
claim
as
--
as
he
makes
here
because
3771
(e)
would
clearly
have
been
applicable.
the
--
my
time
has
expired.
