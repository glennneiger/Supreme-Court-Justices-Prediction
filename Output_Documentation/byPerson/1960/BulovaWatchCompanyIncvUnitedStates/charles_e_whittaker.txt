justice
charles
e.
whittaker
may
i
ask
you
please,
sir?
do
you
--
does
that
argument
mean
that
you
contend
that
section
2411
applies
only
to
instances
where
judgments
are
rendered?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well
then,
is
it
not
true
that
in
all
except
where
an
excess
profits
credit
adjustment
is
involved,
the
administrative
remedies
by
the
commissioner
in
the
absence
of
a
judgment
pay
its
interest
from
the
date
of
the
overpayment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
are
you
saying
you're
(inaudible)
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
not
as
so
(inaudible)
your
argument
imply
defendant
is
ordered
by
a
judgment
acknowledged
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
isn't
--
isn't
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
for
what
situation
wouldn't
or
couldn't?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
don't
understand
that
there
is
any
proposed
deficiency
by
the
commissioner
that
is
not
subject
to
redetermination
by
the
tax
court
in
its
timely
petition.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
mr.
davis.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
--
do
--
do
you
have
the
same
understanding
of
mr.
weiss'
position
as
i,
which
is
this
that
with
substantive
right
of
the
taxpayer
here
to
interest,
depends
upon
form
in
which
of
the
matter
is
determined.
if
in
an
article
iii
court,
then
it's
from
the
date
of
overpayment,
but
if
it's
not
in
an
article
iii
court,
then
it's
from
the
date
of
notice
or
claim.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
yes.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
(inaudible)
including
the
word,
“judgment”
that
found
2411
(a)
and
it's
a
good
common
law
(inaudible).
and
what's
behind
it
and
the
facts
to
it
is
not
a
judgment.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
it's
as
settling
an
order
of
an
administrative
agency.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
that
--
that
factor,
i
--
i
agree
with
you,
but
that's
determined
by
section
3771,
isn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
wasn't
it?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
no.
