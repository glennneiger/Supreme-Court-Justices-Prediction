you
going
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
deal
with
this
argument
that
turns
on
whether
the
payment
is
voluntary
or
involuntary
in
the
sense
the
taxpayer
has
to
sue
--
sue
for
it.
justice
john
m.

that's
his
whole
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
say
that's
a
so-called
involuntary
payment
on
that
premise
which
by
its
terms
carries
interest
only
on
a
limited
basis.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
his
distinction
between
--
broadly
between
3771
and
28
and
the
judicial

is

you
win
this
case,
you

won't
have
had
a
bad
investment
of
6%
for
14
years?
justice
john
m.

oh,
i
thought
you
were
complaining.
