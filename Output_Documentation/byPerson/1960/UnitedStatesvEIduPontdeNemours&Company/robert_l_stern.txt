mr.
robert
l.
stern
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
general
motors
corporation.
it's
concerned
with
this
case
and
its
interest
in
having
the
decree
below
affirmed
arises
from
the
fact
that
any
plan
of
forced
divestiture
such
as
the
government
proposes,
will
seriously
injure
its
stockholders.
in
this
connection,
it
should
be
noted
that
general
motors
has
not
been
found
to
have
violated
the
clayton
act
and
that
obviously,
its
stockholders
apart
from
du
pont,
are
completely
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing
at
all.
i
don't
want,
however,
to
talk
about
the
effect
upon
general
motors
stockholders
as
if
it
were
a
part
of
the
case
in
vacuo
or
by
itself
or
as
if
we
were
arguing
that
no
antitrust
decree
could
ever
do
anything
which
would
injure
stockholders
or
that
divestiture
can
never
be
ordered
when
it
might
diminish
the
value
of
stock.
here,
this
court
ordered
that
the
district
court
enter
a
decree
which
would
eliminate
the
effect
of
du
pont's
acquisition
of
general
motors
stock,
offensive
to
the
statute.
the
basic
question
in
the
case
which
mr.
cox
has
already
covered
is
whether
the
decree
entered
below
is
a
reasonable
means
of
doing
that.
in
choosing
between
different
forms
of
remedies,
it
is
appropriate
to
consider
the
effect
upon
general
motors
stockholders,
so
long
as
the
remedies
are
effective.
now,
this
was
the
district
court's
approach
to
the
problem.
we
submitted,
has
been
this
court's
approach
to
the
problem
in
the
cases
in
the
past.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
particularly
though
i
have
not
time
to
quote
it
to
the
passage
in
the
american
tobacco
case
which
is
quoted
on
page
57
of
our
brief,
which
sets
forth
the
three
principal
guiding
elements
which
equity
courts
consider
in
entering
antitrust
decrees.
one
of
those
elements
was
the
effect
upon
innocent
stockholders
and
that's
the
case
which
both
sides
cite,
as
guiding
authority
in
this
area.
now,
the
government
says
that
the
district
court
regarded
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
as
the
principal
factor
in
this
case,
rather
than
the
public
interest
in
effective
enforcement.
for
this,
it
relies
on
a
few
expressions
in
the
opinion
which
we
submit,
are
taken
completely
out
of
context.
and
here
again,
i
would
like
to
read
the
opinion
or
large
parts
of
it
to
you,
but
i
don't
have
time
and
i
would
like
to
refer
you
particularly
to
pages
3196
to
3198
and
pages
3246
to
3248
where
you
find
what
the
district
court
himself
said
on
this
court.
now,
we
don't
understand
the
government
really
to
argue
that
it
is
proper
--
that
it
is
improper
to
consider
hardship
to
innocent
persons
in
choosing
between
effective
remedies.
its
arguments
really
are
that
no
remedy
but
divestiture
can
be
effective
or
alternative
that
divestiture
is
required
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
cox
has
discussed
these
points
and
i
will
not
go
over
them
again.
they
are
covered
in
our
brief.
but
i
would
like
to
make
two
observations
before
coming
to
the
main
subject
which
i
do
intend
to
cover,
the
harm
the
general
motors
stockholders.
the
first
place,
government
counsel
said
yesterday
that
divestiture
with
free
general
motors
from
the
restraints
which
had
previously
been
imposed
upon
it.
to
that,
the
answer
is
that
the
decree
imposed
by
the
court
below
has
already
done
that.
there
is
no
possible
way
in
which
the
du
pont
can
now
influence
general
motors
to
force
it
to
take
or
to
prefer
du
pont
products
such
as
the
court
found
was
improper
before.
secondly
and
to
elaborate
perhaps
unnecessarily
on
an
--
on
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
whittaker,
i
would
like
to
comment
on
mr.
davis'
suggestion
that
300,000
du
pont
stockholders
which
switched
from
buying
general
motors
cars
to
fords
and
plymouths,
if
these
cars
didn't
have
du
pont
paint
upon
them.
the
first
place
we
think
this
is
other
nonsense.
they
wouldn't
know
or
care
what
kind
of
paint
is
on
the
cars.
most
stockholders
i'm
sure
don't
know
anything
about
that.
there's
no
suggestion
that
du
pont
stockholders
in
the
past
have
been
less
willing
to
buy
oldsmobiles
or
even
cadillacs,
which
have
never
had
du
pont
paint
upon
them
and
--
and
the
other
type
of
car.
and
that
appears
in
the
prior
record,
page
1923
to
1927.
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
tell
you
our
argument
down
at
the
record
which
is
distinct
from
some
of
the
speculation
which
you
heard
yesterday.
now,
even
if
it
were
true
that
the
du
pont
stockholders
would
not
like
to
buy
general
motors
cars,
they
didn't
have
du
pont
paint
on
them
that
really
wouldn't
do
them
any
good.
it
wouldn't
do
general
motors
any
good
because
they
would
do
the
same
thing
if
they
didn't
have
any
interest
in
general
motors
at
all.
it
would
be
just
as
much
loss
to
general
motors,
the
du
pont
stockholders
didn't
have
voting
rights
in
general
motors
stock.
there
would
indeed,
be
much
less
incentive
for
them
to
switch
if
that
were
the
case.
so
unbalance
and
that
was
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
whittaker
yesterday.
unbalance
just
a
brief
statistical
analysis
of
the
facts
and
the
reports
of
the
companies
which
are
in
the
record,
shows
that
they
would
have
much
more
to
lose
by
switching
from
general
motors
to
a
car
which
had
some
other
--
with
possibly
had
du
pont
paint
upon
them.
because
the
record
shows
from
this
simple
calculation,
that
the
profit
on
general
motors
sales
for
each
share
of
du
pont
which
these
stockholders
which
would
have
the
shares
of
both
companies
would
have,
would
be
either
25
times
as
much
or
six
times
as
much
depending
in
how
you
calculate
it,
i
haven't
got
time
to
do
it
early.
as
their
profit
on
the
proportion
of
du
pont
sales
which
go
to
general
motors,
that
proportion
i
add
has
been
--
it's
going
down.
it's
about
2%
of
du
pont
sales
now
and
it's
less
than
1%
of
general
motors'
total
purchases.
that's
what
we're
concerned
about.
now,
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
problem
of
what
would
be
the
effect
of
divestiture.
what
would
happen
if
du
pont
had
to
get
rid
of
these
63
million
shares
of
stock
which
are
worth
well
over
$2.5
billion,
depending
on
how
they're
valued?
there
has
never
been
anything
like
that
amount
forced
on
the
market
under
any
circumstances
before.
the
plan
proposed
by
the
government
below
was
for
43
million
shares
to
be
distributed
to
all
the
general
motors
stockholders
except
christiana,
delaware
and
some
officers
and
for
the
20
million
shares
to
be
sold
over
a
period
of
10
years.
now,
the
evidence
unquestionably
showed
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
supply
--
firstly,
that
the
supply
would
be
increased
by
the
forced
sale
of
this
20
million
shares.
and
also,
by
the
sale
of
a
large
part
of
the
43
million
shares
by
recipients
who
needed
the
money
to
pay
the
additional
income
taxes.
and
that
in
addition,
there
would
be
other
sales
by
persons
--
other
stockholders
who
wouldn't
want
to
hold
general
motors
during
a
period
in
which
it
wouldn't
--
in
which
it
would
leg
behind
of
the
--
the
rest
of
the
market
because
of
the
effects
of
the
decree.
the
first
two
of
these
items
would
add
over
three
million
shares
a
year
to
the
nine
million
normally
traded
on
the
market
now,
over
a
third
more
--
at
least
over
a
third
more
and
then
the
present
market.
now,
this
increase
in
supply
would
be
accompanied
by
no
increase
in
demand.
on
the
contrary,
the
effect
of
a
decree
of
divestiture
would
be
to
decrease
the
demand,
at
least
at
the
same
price,
because
people
wouldn't
want
to
buy
a
stock
which
they
thought
would
go
down
or
at
least
not
go
up
as
much
as
the
rest
of
the
market.
so,
the
result
of
a
substantial
increase
in
supply
with
no
increase
in
demand
and
indeed
a
decrease
in
demand
would
obviously
be
a
substantial
decline
in
the
price.
in
the
testimony
of
the
financial
experts,
most
qualified
to
speak
in
this
subject,
was
that
this
decline
would
be
in
the
area
of
20%
to
30%.
but
even
if
it
were
substantially
less
than
that,
the
effect
could
be
a
serious
one.
and
the
stockholders
who
would
be
for
any
reason,
unable
to
retain
their
stock
for
the
full
period
of
divestiture
perhaps
10
years,
would
lose
at
least
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars.
now,
our
brief
summarizes
the
testimony
in
that.
you
may
wonder
why
we
spent
36
pages
to
prove
what
seems
to
be
so
obvious.
we
thought
this
whole
treatment
was
necessary,
however,
to
deal
with
an
--
to
meet
the
way
in
which
the
government
dealt
with
the
problem
in
its
brief.
in
its
brief,
it
does
not
say,
however,
that
the
findings
of
the
district
court
along
the
line
which
i
have
summarized
are
clearly
erroneous
and
that's
what
has
to
say
as
i
read
the
rule
to
if
it
is
to
have
those
findings
disregarded
by
this
court.
it
does
say
that
disagrees
with
the
findings.
and
then
it
makes
the
peculiar
argument
in
its
replied
brief
that
its
position
is
supported
and
i
quote
because
i
wouldn't
dare
state
this
without
quoting,
"is
supported
by
weight
of
the
testimony
of
several
of
the
expert
witnesses
in
the
case."
and
then
it
cites
the
cross-examination
of
a
few
of
the
witnesses
on
its
side.
why
any
attention
should
be
paid
by
the
court
or
any
other
court
to
the
weight
of
the
testimony
of
a
few
witnesses
without
regard
to
the
testimony
of
all
the
other
witnesses
and
at
least
a
thousand
pages
of
record
or
indeed,
the
cross-examination
of
these
same
witnesses,
i
find
it
hard
to
understand.
obviously,
this
court,
like
the
district
court,
must
consider
the
record
as
a
whole
and
not
merely
the
direct
examination
of
a
few
of
the
government's
witnesses.
the
government's
brief
never
mentioned
to
the
rest
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.
now,
yesterday,
government
counsel
didn't
make
that
statement.
i
think
he
probably
had
to
make
sense
too
early,
but
he
said
that
we
exaggerate
greatly
are
trying
to
--
frightened
the
court
with
respect
to
the
--
our
argument
about
market
consequences.
it
was
clear
to
him,
he
said,
that
the
general
motors
stock
could
be
sold
at
yields
which
returned
5.5%
to
6%.
that
people
would
then
flock
into
the
market
to
buy
it.
now,
that
is
exactly
the
range
of
yield
which
the
witnesses
for
the
appellees
testified,
would
bring
general
motors
stock
--
would
enable
du
pont
to
sell
its
general
motors
stock
around
6%
was
there
--
what
they
generally
said.
now,
that
6%
if
you
do
a
little
calculating
based
upon
general
motors'
$2
dividend
which
both
sides
assume
will
be
continued,
would
mean
that
the
stock
would
be
sold
at
33
and
a
third.
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
it
was
selling
at
$46.
right
now,
it's
selling
at
$43
in
the
fraction.
so,
if
you
would
see
what
the
difference
is
between
either
46
or
43
and
33
which
is
what
mr.
davis
seems
to
agree
with
the
testimony
now,
would
mean
you
find
that
the
value
of
general
motors
would
be
decreased
exactly
20%
to
30%,
which
is
what
the
witnesses
said
it
would.
and
i
may
add
that
that
10
points
off
of
the
value
of
general
motors
stock
is
almost
$3
billion.
now,
the
differences
between
us
therefore,
it
seemed
to
be
not
matters
of
fact
as
to
whether
there
would
be
a
decrease
in
the
value
of
stock
or
how
much
there
will
be
a
decrease.
what
matters
of
--
what
adjectives
you
apply
to
them.
we
think
that
the
amount
is
substantial.
we
don't
have
to
contend
it's
disastrous
and
would
even
pinpoint
the
exact
amount.
and
the
government
said
that
nobody
is
going
to
be
hurt
by
all
these
because
after
10
years,
general
motors
probably
will
be
just
as
well-off
as
before.
but,
a
lot
of
general
motors
stockholders
who
can't
wait
10
years
to
keep
their
stock,
then
will
may
have
to
sell
for
any
number
of
reasons
like
sending
a
boy
to
college
or
selling
a
house
or
winding
up
in
the
state.
ten
years
is
a
temporary
period
from
some
points
of
view,
but
not
from
the
points
of
view
of
a
lot
of
stockholders,
will
suffer
20%
to
30%
loss
and
they'll
think
that
is
the
very
severe
loss
indeed.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
big
corporation
here,
even
just
with
a
lot
of
wealthy
stockholders
even
though
--
even
wealthy
stockholders
i
think
are
entitled
consideration
by
this
court.
the
average
loss
over
the
whole
group
of
general
motors
stockholders
would
be
about
$3000
each.
most
of
these
stockholders
are
smaller
and
i
submit
that
that
is
a
substantial
item
which
the
court
should
take
into
account.
now,
yesterday,
the
government
counsel
said
that
the
stock
market
fluctuates
a
lot
anyhow
and
that
in
the
last
year,
it
went
up
and
down
about
27%.
therefore,
it
went
down
20%
or
30%
more
well,
what
difference
does
that
make?
well,
all
we
have
that
adding
or
rather
subtracting
this
20%
or
30%
from
whatever
would
happen
to
the
market
otherwise,
would
make
a
very
big
difference
and
would
hurt
the
people
to
whom
i
have
referred.
now,
the
government
seeks
to
undermine
the
findings
on
market
impact
by
arguing
that
prices
ultimately
are
determined
by
anticipated
earnings
and
yields
and
actual
earnings
and
yields.
and
though
they
don't
quite
say
this,
they
imply
that
supply
and
demand
really
don't
have
very
much
to
do
with
it
at
all.
but
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
even
their
witnesses
show
that
it
was
not
that
simple.
a
very
important
factor
in
stock
evaluation
is
how
much
is
the
stock
going
to
go
up
or
down
in
the
next
period
of
time?
now,
the
records
showed
and
the
witnesses
testified
that
if
the
market
is
not
artificially
disturbed,
all
of
these
factors,
earnings
and
dividends
and
yields
and
the
like,
are
reflected
in
supply
and
demand.
but
if
for
external
or
noneconomic
reasons,
the
supply
to
be
sold
is
greatly
increased
without
any
accompanying
increase
in
the
demand,
the
additional
sales
can
only
be
made
at
a
lower
price.
there
won't
be
any
other
way
of
getting
the
stock
sold.
and
this
depress
price
will
continue
for
as
long
as
the
additional
supply
over
hangs
the
market.
the
government
says
these
effects
will
be
only
temporary,
but
here,
the
effect
would
be
under
the
plans
they
proposed
which
all
seemed
to
cover
about
10
years
for
that
period
of
time.
now,
this
was
all
admitted
by
the
principal
government
economic
witness
dr.
friend
on
his
cross-examination.
and
i
would
like
to
take
the
time
to
read
a
rather
short
statement
of
his,
on
pages
1024
and
1025
of
the
record,
but
time
is
running
and
i
think
possibly,
i'd
better
not.
so
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
passage
at
the
bottom
of
page
1024
of
the
record
and
running
on
to
the
next
page,
where
he
admitted
that
the
effect
on
the
market
would
run
along
for
the
period
of
the
divestiture
and
not
barely
be
a
short
time
effect
such
as
is
the
case
when
you
only
have
a
one
shot
offering.
now,
the
government
makes
other
proposals
as
to
other
ways
in
which
this
might
be
done.
and
mr.
cox
has
referred
to
them
in
his
argument.
but
i
would
like
to
say
a
word
with
respect
to
how
they
would
affect
general
motors
stock.
each
of
them
were
separately
or
in
combination,
they
would
lead
to
the
sale
or
distribution
of
tremendous
quantities
of
stock
and
the
effects
would
be
about
the
same
as
i
have
said.
in
the
first
place,
the
government
proposes
that
there
might
be
a
distribution
to
the
du
pont
--
to
the
du
pont
stockholders.
now,
if
all
of
these
stocks
were
distributed,
it
has
been
indicated
the
recipients
would
feel
impelled
to
sell
large
quantities
of
it,
because
they've
been
accustomed
of
living
off
the
dividends
in
that
stock.
and
the
testimony
was
that
the
effect
of
such
sales
in
that
quantity
would
be
much
worse
than
under
the
government's
plan.
these
people
would
need
this
for
ordinary
expenses.
now,
the
--
what
the
effect
of
that
kind
of
a
plan
or
of
anything
along
this
line
would
be
that
although
du
pont
would
save
--
the
du
pont
stockholders
would
save
taxes,
the
effect
upon
the
general
motors
stockholders
would
be
considerably
worse,
because
more
stock
would
be
sold
than
under
another
kind
of
distribution.
now,
the
government
now
says
that
one-sixth
or
one-third
of
the
du
pont
dividend
should
be
paid
in
general
motors
stock.
now,
this
would
amount
to
either
from
a
--
from
one
to
two
and
a
half
million
shares
a
year.
of
this,
about
one-third
would
be
allocable
to
christiana
and
delaware
and
on
the
government's
theory,
would
have
to
be
sold.
so
when
you
combine
this
with
the
parts
of
this
--
with
the
parts
of
the
one
in
--
one
to
two
million
which
the
stockholders
would
have
to
sell,
you
come
out
again
with
substantial
sales.
now,
if
this
proposed
divestiture
would
be
a
--
were
to
be
accomplished
by
this
means
alone,
it
would
take
from
27
to
55
years,
depending
on
how
it
was
done.
otherwise,
it
would
have
to
be
combined
with
other
methods
if
the
--
if
the
whole
job
was
to
be
done
within
10
years.
but
when
you
combined
it
with
other
methods,
each
of
which
would
have
a
similar
effect
as
i
shall
show,
you
come
out
about
the
same
kind
of
effect
as
under
the
plan
proposed
by
the
government
below.
the
government
seems
to
concede,
you'd
have
to
sell
about
half
of
this
stock.
about
3
million
shares
a
year,
which
would
have
obviously
as
great
and
impact
upon
the
market
prices,
if
you
--
as
if
it
was
sold
under
the
plan
proposed
below
or
is
admitted
the
two
million
shares
would
have
to
be
sold
for
you.
but
the
government
says
general
motors
itself,
could
buy
a
lot
of
these
stocks
and
du
pont
for
its
bonus
and
other
plans.
now
to
some
extent,
general
motors
now
does
buy
stock
for
these
plans
on
the
market.
but
to
the
extent
that
it
does
this
already
and
has
done
it
for
years,
this
demand
as
a
part
of
the
existing
demand
and
to
shift
the
purchase
of
that
stock
to
stocks
sold
by
du
pont
wouldn't
change
the
imbalance
between
supply
and
demand
which
of
course
the
divestiture
would
cause
by
one
iota.
so
that
wouldn't
have
any
effect
in
helping
the
situation.
now,
as
to
exchange
of
these,
du
pont
should
exchange
its
general
motors
stock
for
its
own
stock.
well,
i'm
not
going
to
get
into
the
tax
side
of
--
that
--
that's
a
du
pont
problem.
whether
or
not
such
a
plan
would
harm
du
pont,
it
would
have
an
adverse
effect
upon
the
general
motors
stockholders
as
i
don't
think
it
would
take
me
a
very
long
show.
the
government
admits
that
in
order
to
induce
persons
who
had
bought
general
motors
--
du
pont
--
du
pont
stock
to
shift
to
general
motors,
they
would
have
to
make
what
the
government
somewhat
euphemistically
calls,
reasonably
favorable
offers.
inclining
the
stock
means,
they'd
have
to
allow
a
big
discount
because
otherwise,
why
would
people
who
preferred
on
du
pont
stock
want
to
shift
to
general
motors
stock?
they
always
could've
bought
general
motors
stock
at
the
market
if
they
wanted
it.
so,
that
if
any
substantial
portion
of
du
pont's
general
motors
stock
is
to
be
disposed
of
in
this
way,
would
have
to
be
at
a
big
discount.
but
this
would
affect
the
market
price
of
general
motors
stock
generally,
since
anyone
could
obtain
general
motors
of
a
discount
by
buying
du
pont.
now,
i
can't
tell
you
how
much
this
effect
would
be.
and
nobody
really
here
can
because
as
mr.
cox
has
said,
this
point
wasn't
made
--
raised
below
and
the
defendants
didn't
have
any
opportunity
to
divest
any
evidence
to
it.
this
news
suggestion
therefore
shows
why
it
is
improper
for
the
government
to
present
such
proposals
for
the
first
time
when
defendants
have
no
opportunity
to
meet
them.
now,
in
some
each
of
these
various
plans
which
have
been
proposed
by
the
government
would
have
an
effect
upon
the
--
upon
the
price
of
general
motors
stock.
and
if
the
plans
were
to
be
effective
in
10
years,
their
effect
in
combination,
would
be
just
as
great
as
that
which
was
discussed
below.
now,
i
--
only
to
make
one
more
deal
--
only
one
more
question,
which
wasn't
discussed
upon
mr.
davis'
orally,
but
it
is
discussed
in
their
briefs
and
that
he
might
be
awaiting
reply,
i
think
i
may
--
i'd
better
say
something
about
it.
the
government
argues
that
other
large
stock
offerings
have
been
made
over
the
years
without
any
difficulty
or
adverse
market
consequence.
but
even
the
government's
own
witnesses
admitted
that
no
prior
offerings
were
remotely
comparable
to
what
would
be
required
if
divestiture
ordered
here.
not
only
would
be
that
the
amount
to
be
distributed
be
tremendously
greater
here,
$2.5
to
$3.5
billion
depending
upon
the
value
of
general
motors,
but
the
requirement
that
they're
being
repeated
regular,
substantial
forced
sales
over
a
period
of
10
years,
would
mean
that
the
impact
of
overhanging
a
market
for
that
period
of
time.
the
government's
brief
refers
to
the
largest
of
these
distributions,
presumably
on
the
ground
that
they
are
the
closest
to
the
distribution
here
involved.
with
respect
to
every
one
of
those
stocks,
the
statement
in
the
government's
brief
always
omits
the
critical
fact
which
shows
how
different
the
situation
is
from
that
which
we
have
here.
our
time
only
for
a
few
examples
and
i
hope
the
court
will
compare
what
we
say
in
our
briefs
with
respect
to
these
items
with
the
government
brief
and
then
check
the
record
for
yourself
to
see
who's
right
about
it.
if
she's
not
convinced
that
we're
right
just
from
the
mere
statement
of
it.
the
government
brief
first
refers
to
offerings
of
stock
to
stockholders,
rights
offerings
by
general
motors
in
1955
by
aluminium
over
few
of
them
on
the
1950s
and
by
at&t
and
these
were
pretty
large,
though
nowhere
near
as
large
is
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
but
the
government
doesn't
reveal
that
each
of
these
offerings
was
at
a
discount
from
26%
to
40%.
the
success
of
these
rights
offerings
and
rights
offerings
really
aren't
comparable
with
secondary
offering
such
as
we
have
here,
because
rights
can
be
sold
a
lot
more
simply
and
a
lot
more
easily
than
secondary
offering.
the
success
of
these
offerings
doesn't
prove
that
a
larger
amount
of
stock
can
be
sold
without
a
discount.
the
government
refers
to
the
sloan
foundation
secondary
offering
in
1956,
says
that
didn't
have
much
effect
on
the
value
of
general
motors
stock.
well,
the
evidence,
the
record
shows
that
it
did
knock
the
price
down
a
few
percent,
3%
to
5%
or
6%
at
the
time
that
was
made.
but
that
was
a
one
shot
proposition
that
was
offered
over
as
soon
as
it
was
finished.
it
was
only
one-third
as
much
as
each
of
the
annual
amounts
to
be
sold
under
the
government's
plan
below
and
we
don't
think
it
proves
anything
as
to
what
the
much
larger
distribution
--
what
could
be
done
here
with
the
much
larger
amount
involved.
now,
the
government
refers
to
the
aluminium
situation
because
there
was
a
10-year
divestiture
required
under
the
decree
in
the
alcoa
case.
the
government
says
that
despite
the
forced
sales
of
aluminium
--
not
aluminium
but
aluminium
stock
under
that
decree,
the
stock
did
better
bearing
the
10-year,
an
industrial
stock,
generally.
therefore,
the
decree
had
no
impact.
what
the
government
doesn't
point
out
is
that
in
comparison
with
the
remainder
of
the
aluminum
industry,
aluminium
did
very,
very
poorly.
in
fact,
all
the
other
aluminum
stocks
went
up
three
to
10
times
as
much
during
this
period.
and
i
refer
you
specifically
to
du
pont
exhibit
47,
which
points
this
out
very
accurately
and
graphically.
i
also
add
that
only
$150,000,000
worth
of
stock
was
offered
under
that
case,
which
amounts
to
about
6%
of
the
stock
which
is
involved
here.
a
reference
is
made
to
a
large
offering
by
a&p
grocery
chain,
$80,000,000
in
one
year,
again
in
one
shot
offering.
the
government
doesn't
point
out
that
its
own
witness,
dr.
friend,
said
that
that
stock
went
off
10%
to
15%
at
the
time
of
that
much
smaller
offering.
and
the
government
may
refer
as
it
does
in
its
brief
to
the
big
sale
by
the
ford
foundation
when
ford
stock
was
first
put
upon
the
market.
that
was
$650,000,000.
but
there,
the
government
point
does
not
point
out
there
ever
was
any
ford
stock
upon
the
market
before.
there
was
a
tremendous
demand
by
people
who
never
been
able
to
get
ford
and
of
course,
there
were
no
prior
prices
to
compare
this
ford
offering
with.
on
the
contrary,
anyone
who's
been
able
to
fill
--
purchase
general
motors
stocks
over
the
years.
i
won't
go
into
the
others.
i
would
like
to
conclude
with
the
point
i
made
at
the
beginning.
it
was
entirely
proper
for
the
district
court
in
choosing
a
remedy
to
select
that
which
would
have
the
least
harmful
effect
upon
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
innocent
stockholders
involved
in
this
case,
so
long
as
the
remedy
is
effective.
here,
there
is
no
possibility
that
du
pont
can
continue
to
influence
general
motors
under
the
decree
of
the
court
below.
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
the
decree
should
be
affirmed.
