justice
felix
frankfurter
what's
your
brief
is
this,
that
that
is
not
a
crucial
--
at
least
one
half
of
the
statements
that
was
made
is
not
crucial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
but
just
supposing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
one
half
of
the
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
sorry,
you
should
pay
both
has
a
wrong
--
i
was
thinking
of
the
second
half,
is
good
for
the
united
states
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
brief,
i
haven't
looked
at,
does
your
brief
on
the
compulsory
nature
of
divestiture,
divestiture,
the
compulsory
feature
of
the
decree,
does
your
--
does
the
government's
brief
put
before
us
the
practice
regarding
divestitures
in
past
decrees
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
other
than
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
or
it's
under
the
clayton
act,
under
the
sherman
law,
and
under
the
sherman
law.
justice
felix
frankfurter
can
you
differentiate
between
the
two?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
--
you
can
--
you
can
make
differentiation
regarding
section
11,
can
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
so
that
your
clayton
act
--
your
claim
under
the
clayton
act,
the
claim
of
requirement
under
the
clayton
act
by
this
argumentative
construction
of
the
statute
would
bring
about
compulsion
under
the
clayton
act
provision
is
not
applicable
to
sherman
law,
indeed
where
sherman
law
violations
have
not
been
found.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
--
the
reasons
for
the
differentiation
that
you
suggested
a
minute
ago
regarding
the
sherman
law
violation,
although
practically
as
of
--
to
the
clayton
violations
wouldn't
apply,
wouldn't
be
operated
in
that.
is
that
right?
because
your
argument
is
there
must
be
always
the
divestiture
in
clayton
act.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
although
there
may
not
be
this
threatened
monopolistic
tendency.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
will
be
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
else
to
restraints,
yes.
it
is
a
different
thing.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
very
different
thing.
that's
my
point.
to
may
have
non-monopolistic
tendencies
under
the
clayton
act
compelling
to
this
--
from
your
point
of
view
which
would
not
be
applicable,
not
be
true
of
sherman
law
situation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no.
i
understand
that
this
is
--
what
i
mean
the
remedy
for
non-monopolistic
violations
of
the
clayton
act
would
be
followed
by
divestiture
whether
monopolistic
or
merely
restrain.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
sherman
act,
it's
not
compulsory
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
either
it
is
or
it
isn't,
you
say
your
point
one
under
the
clayton
act
is
that
they
actually
require
divestiture.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
sherman
law
does
not
require
though
it
maybe
highly
desirable
and
relevant
to
have
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
what
your
statement?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
because
it's
an
appropriate
equity
of
remedy
not
because
the
statute
requires
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
say
as
to
the
clayton
act,
the
statute
in
effect
said
so.
justice
felix
frankfurter
must
be,
not
should.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
must
be.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
--
do
you
think
the
consequences
of
an
existing
tax
system
--
the
existing
tax
systems
upon
the
kind
of
a
decree
a
district
court
molds
is
an
irrelevant
consideration?
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
there's
a
choice.
i'm
--
this
is
going
beyond
your
first
point.
justice
felix
frankfurter
assuming
there
is
an
area
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
within
which
you
can
move
or
cast
consequences
irrelevant
to
your
selection
of
the
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
talking
about
the
company
making
a
choice.
i'm
talking
about
alternatives
that
are
open,
having
passed
the
compulsory
requirement
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
that
brings
me
to
what
scope
you
give
for
the
discretionary
power,
if
any,
to
the
district
court
in
molding
the
decree.
that
--
that's
really
what's
involved
here.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
in
--
in
determining
the
limit,
do
--
does
consequences
have
a
relevant
share?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
let
see
if
i
understand
that,
you
say
that
there
must
be
divestiture
in
order
to
accomplish
the
result
of
the
--
of
the
decision
of
this
court,
then
how
does
the
divestiture
should
be
accomplished
may
take
into
account
of
that
consequence?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
starting
point
is
that
divestiture
is
indispensable.
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
are
you
suggesting
you
might
hold
up
the
formulation
of
the
decree,
he'll
come
with
expression
of
sympathy
of
what
you
speak.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
suggestion
of
the
government,
as
i
get
it,
is
largely
that
there's
a
momentum
to
the
old
relationship
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
continues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
--
i
have
an
extra
--
extra
push
to
the
momentum
as
it
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
davis,
before
you
sit
down,
would
you
be
good
enough
to
indicate
the
government's
view
regarding
the
relationship
of
this
court
to
the
--
this
presumable
discretion
exercised
by
the
district
court
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
on
the
assumption
that
you
haven't
get
to
use
the
word.
on
the
assumption
that
what
the
district
court
did
and
should
being
informed
that
any
in
this
decree
was
not
an
arbitrary
act
or
beyond
its
power,
what
do
you
say
for
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
would
imply
that
with
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
our
function
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
reference
to
what
this
district
court
did
or
district
court
does?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
if
that's
a
rule
of
law
and
these
kinds
of
a
case
to
have
divestiture
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
from
the
statute
explicitly,
but
from
the
effectuation
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
insofar
as
--
insofar
as
the
decree
is
an
allowable
exercise
of
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
don't
see
here
de
novo,
do
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
now,
where
do
you
think
it
was
a
disallowable
exercise
of
judgment
by
the
district
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
itself
is
an
exercise
of
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
semantic
as
allergic.
i'm
allergic
to
that.
i
don't
mean
to
have
been
indulging
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
just
like
all
talk,
words
are
medium
--
media
of
talk
of
course
of
thinking
in
this
field.i
mean
need
to
get
into
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
that's
what
you're
holding
that
this
was
not
an
--
that
--
that
in
deciding
whether
it
was
effective,
you're
exercising
a
judgment.
it's
a
forecast.
it's
partly
a
prophecy
to
what
extent
these
influences
will
continue
and
there
is
subterranean
way
to
which
they
could
continue.
that's
--
that's
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
that
is
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
doesn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
when
you
say
the
findings
that
the
other
point
to
which
you
addressed
yourself
when
justice
stewart
intervened.
are
you
challenging
any
of
the
findings
on
the
basis
of
which
it
formed
the
judgment?
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't.
you
simply
said,
sine
this
was
rest
on
expert
testimony.
we
may
reject
the
expert
testimony,
although
you
don't
challenge
the
finding
based
on
that
expert
testimony.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
do
not
know
what
that
mean.
you
disagree
with
them,
but
you
don't
--
you
don't
address
yourself
to
say
they
were
undeservedly
or
improperly
made,
do
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course
you
attacked
the
conclusion
drawn
from
the
findings
namely
that
divestiture
is
not
required.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
doesn't
add
up
to
that
legal
conclusion,
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
you
disagree
with
the
underlying
basis
on
which
that
conclusion
was
drawn.
this
isn't
in
other
words,
the
medical
case
that
we
had
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
asking
us
on
the
basis
of
all
the
materials
in
the
argument
to
make
a
different
informed
guest
in
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
doing
is
--
you're
saying
if
no
divestiture
is
decreed,
then
there
is
no
merger.
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
no,
no,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
case
came
here
again
as
i
remembered
for
construction
of
what
it
was
to
the
court
really
decided,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
was
wondering
whether
they
said
what
they
meant
after
which.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
i
do
think
it
came
here,
you
know.[laughter]
