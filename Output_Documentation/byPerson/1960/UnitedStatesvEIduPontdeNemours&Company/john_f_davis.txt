mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
this
is
the
second
stage
of
the
antitrust
proceeding
relating
to
du
pont's
acquisition
of
63
million
shares
of
the
stock
of
general
motors
corporation.
four
years
ago,
this
court
held
that
this
acquisition
was
a
--
was
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
present
issue
is
what
relief
should
be
granted
in
order
to
cure
this
violation.
and
most
specifically
the
question
is,
whether
the
decree
of
the
court
below
which
transferred
the
voting
rights
in
the
63
million
shares
from
du
pont
to
its
stockholders,
the
decree
also
eliminating
interlocking
directors
and
enjoining
specific
business
relationships
between
the
two
corporations.
the
question
is
whether
this
decree
gives
adequate
relief.
the
government
argues
that
the
illegal
acquisition
should
be
undone
by
ordering
a
surrender
of
the
stock.
this
is
a
rare
case
in
that
one
of
the
parties
has
tried
to
frighten
the
courts
into
deciding
a
corporate
case
its
way
by
asserting
that
disaster
will
follow
the
divestiture
and
by
parading
a
long
list
of
expert
witnesses,
du
pont
presents
an
in
terrorem
argument
as
to
why
it
should
not
make
a
clean
break
with
its
past.
these
are
the
same
tactics
which
were
employed
in
opposing
the
enforcement
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
many
years
ago.
and
there,
they
met
with
no
success.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
nothing
of
inherent
value
which
is
taken
away
when
one
untangles
one
of
this
corporate
(inaudible).
once
the
illegal
advantage
would
--
is
the
object
of
the
statute
to
prohibit
is
removed,
then
the
corporate
relationship
is
in
effect
excess
baggage.
and
in
the
end,
all
of
the
participants
will
gain
by
dividing
--
by
simplifying
the
corporate
structure
and
separating
it
into
its
component
parts.
and
that
is
what
we
purpose
should
be
done
here.
merely
four
years
ago
when
the
court
determined
that
the
du
pont
investment
--
the
du
pont
holdings
were
in
violation
of
section
7
of
the
--
of
the
clayton
act,
it
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
the
court
frame
and
appropriate
decree.
the
government
told
the
district
court
that
it
believe
that
the
only
adequate
decree
must
require
divestiture
of
the
acquired
stock.
and
when
the
court
requested
that
the
--
that
the
government
present
a
specific
plan,
the
government
presented
a
plan
in
which
it
suggested
that
the
stock
should
be
divested
over
a
period
of
10
years
by
the
declaration
of
the
g.
m.
stock
as
dividends
to
its
own
stockholders.
it
proposed
that
the
stock
which
would
have
been
allocable
to
the
two
du
pont
holding
companies,
delaware
investment
and
--
realty
&
investment
and
christiana
securities
should
be
sold
by
trustees
in
order
to
prevent
a
continuation
of
any
influence
through
these
two
holding
companies.
it
proposed
that
there
should
be
a
--
an
outlying
of
interlocking
directors
and
offices
and
it
did
propose
certain
--
that
certain
transactions
between
the
two
companies
be
enjoined.
the
internal
--
the
internal
revenue
service
advised
that
the
declaration
of
the
general
motors
stock
as
dividends
would
be
taxable
to
the
recipients
as
ordinary
income
rather
than
as
a
capital
gain.
this
plan
proposed
by
the
government
was
opposed
by
du
pont,
by
general
motors.
it's
opposed
by
christiana
--
christiana
and
delaware.
it
was
also
opposed
by
two
amicus
curiae
who
were
appointed
by
the
district
court
to
represent
the
interest
of
the
stockholders
of
general
motors
and
of
du
pont
stockholders
as
such.du
pont
and
the
amici
proposed
plans
under
which
du
pont
would
keep
the
stock
but
would
transfer
the
voting
rights
to
its
stockholders.
this
would
mean
that
each
du
pont's
stockholder
would
be
given
a
permanent
proxy
to
vote
about
1-1/3
shares
of
general
motors
stock
in
addition
to
power
he
had
with
respect
to
his
own
du
pont
stock,
under
this
plan
to
interlocking
directors
and
officers
which
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
each
du
pont
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
shareholder
would
be
given
a
right
to
vote
his
proportionate
part
of
du
pont's
holdings
of
generals
motors
stock,
which
would
mean
that
he
would
have
about
1-1/3
of
votes
that
when
you
distribute
the
63
million
shares
among
the
45
million
stockholders
of
du
pont,
you
get
about
1-1/3
votes
for
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
each
share.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i'm
--
i'm
--
when
i
say
shareholders,
i'm
wrong,
i
mean
stock.
each
--
each
stock,
each
share
of
stock
would
carry
1-1/3
votes
of
--
of
general
motors.
mr.
john
f.
davis
each
share.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
so
that
if
he'd
have
a
hundred
share
he'd
get
a
130
votes
of
the
general
motors.
the
district
court
held
very
extensive
hearings
on
these
plans
in
both
sides
presented
their
experts
and
offered
studies
to
prove
that
divestiture
was
practical
or
was
not
practical.
the
district
court
published
its
opinion
in
october
of
1959
followed
by
its
decree
a
month
later.
and
that
is
the
decree
which
is
now
before
the
court.
in
general,
it
accepted
the
--
the
du
pont
general
motors'
proposals
rather
than
the
government's
proposal,
not
in
detail
but
in
general.
it
provided
that
general
motors
could
--
that
du
pont
could
continue
to
hold
the
stock
of
--
of
general
motors,
but
did
require
that
the
votes
to
be
passed
on
to
the
stockholders,
except
that
it
further
provided
that
the
votes
which
would
have
been
passed
on
to
delaware
and
to
christiana
and
to
the
officers
of
those
two
companies
should
be
sterilized,
no
one
should
exercise
that
vote.
it
also
provided
for
outlying,
interlocking
to
officers
and
directors.
and
it
went
further
than
the
--
than
the
government
even
went
in
outlying
certain
transactions
between
general
motors
and
--
and
du
pont
such
transactions
says,
where
it
presumed
might
give
some
advantage
to
one
corporation
or
the
other.
and
the
decree
also
included
the
provision
under
which
the
government
could
reapproach
the
court
for
additional
relief
in
case
there
was
any
change
in
the
tax
law
or
in
the
case
it
was
demonstrated
that
the
decree
was
not
being
effective
to
--
to
terminate
the
violation.
now,
we
believe
that
this
decree
provided
inadequate
relief.
and
i
pose
to
divide
my
argument
roughly
into
--
into
three
parts.
first,
i
will
argue
that
divestiture
is
the
remedy
required
by
the
statute
for
violations
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
second,
i
shall
argue
that
the
court's
order
provides
inadequate
relief
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
then
third
place,
i
shall
argue
that
divestiture
can
be
achieved
without
the
undue
hardships
which
the
appellees
claim.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
the
first
was
right
--
the
second
and
third
are
--
are
unnecessary.
if
it's
a
required
relief,
why,
the
court
would
have
to
issue
it
whether
the
adequate
relief
could
be
given
under
the
other
and
whether
or
not
it
caused
hardships.
so
that
these
are
really
in
the
alternative,
the
second
too,
in
alternative
to
the
first.
this
--
this
particular
proceeding
was
commenced
under
section
15
of
the
clayton
act.
and
in
--
and
on
my
first
point,
the
question
is
whether
section
15
of
the
clayton
act
requires
--
in
itself
requires
divestiture.
section
15
is
quoted
at
page
5
of
our
brief.
it
is
not
particularly
helpful
on
this
question
because
it
is
stated
in
very
general
language.
it
provides
that
the
court
may
prevent
and
restrain
such
violations,
referring
to
violations
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
not
helpful
to
me.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
natural
that
it
was
stated
in
these
general
terms
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
the
general
enforcement
--
provision
which
supplies
not
only
to
section
7,
which
deals
with
ownership
of
stock,
but
deals
with
section
8
which
deals
with
interlocking
directories
and
it
deals
with
the
other
sections
of
the
clayton
act
which
involved
price
discrimination
in
other
matters.
some
help,
however,
can
be
--
can
be
had
in
the
proper
interpretation
of
section
15
from
section
11
of
the
act.
section
11
of
the
act
is
a
section
which
authorizes
various
administrative
commissions
to
enforce
the
clayton
act,
the
--
the
federal
trade
commission,
the
commerce
commission,
the
federal
and
the
federal
reserve
board.
and
in
connection
with
those
proceedings
which
are
commenced
through
the
administrative
commissions,
it
is
specifically
provided
that
after
they
hold
the
hearing
and
find
the
facts,
if
they
find
the
violation,
they
shall
issue
an
order
requiring
such
person
to
cease
and
desist
from
such
violations
and
divest
himself
of
the
stock
held.
in
other
words,
section
11
is
mandatory
in
its
language
as
to
the
relief
which
should
be
granted
for
a
violation
of
section
7.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
very
persuasive
reason
why
congress
would
give
a
different
method
of
relief
in
section
15
and
in
section
11
if
it
did
not
intend
that
the
same
procedure
--
the
same
relief
should
be
given.
also,
i
think
it
helps
in
construing
section
15
to
know
that
it
is
in
terms
--
is
lifted
verbatim
from
the
sherman
act,
from
section
4
of
the
sherman
act,
i
think
it
is.
so,
one
would
assume
that
when
congress
took
the
very
language
from
the
sherman
act
and
put
it
in
the
clayton
act,
that
congress
might
very
well
have
intended
that
there
should
be
the
same
relief
granted
under
the
clayton
act
which
had
previously
been
granted
by
the
courts
under
the
sherman
act.
and
it
is
a
fact
that
in
this
merger
type
of
violation,
the
sherman
act
covers
many
other
types
of
violation
but
in
this
merger
type
of
violation,
the
relief,
which
has
always
been
granted
under
the
sherman
act,
is
divestiture.
this
was
so
before
1914
when
the
clayton
act
was
thought
it
was
passed
and
it
has
been
so
since
that
time.
the
most
--
most
recent
determination
by
this
court
in
the
sherman
act
case
was
the
international
boxing
club
case
just
two
years
ago.
by
this
court
said,
"it
is
antitrust
policy
to
decree
dissolution
where
the
creation
of
the
combination
is
itself
the
violation."
and
it
cites
to
support
this
united
states
against
crescent
amusement
company,
although
it
could
have
cited
many
other
cases.
thus,
when
congress
borrowed
this
language
from
the
--
from
the
sherman
act
and
put
it
in
the
clayton
act,
it
probably
intended
to
impose
the
same
type
of
relief
which
it
characteristically
been
imposed
under
that
statute.
so
we
urge
that
divestiture
was
what
congress
intended.
however,
if
the
court
should
not
accept
this
proposition,
then
i
think
that
the
least
that
can
be
said
is
that
congress
intended
that
the
normal
relief,
that
the
relief
in
the
ordinary
section
7
case
should
be
divestiture.
where
the
offense
is
the
acquisition
of
stock,
it
seems
but
natural
that
the
cure
is
to
undo
the
offense,
to
undo
the
acquisition
that
is
to
require
divestiture.
the
appellee
say
that
may
be
so
but
this
is
an
abnormal
case.
and
why
it
is
abnormal?
it's
abnormal
in
the
first
place
because
of
the
size
of
the
enterprises
which
are
involved.
well,
i
think
the
size
of
the
enterprises
work
--
works
both
twice.
if
the
fact
that
2.5
to
3.5
billion
dollars
that
is
involved
results
in
the
remedy
being
heroic,
the
same
fact,
it
means
that
the
economic
effect
to
the
violation
is
also
enormous.the
factor
of
size,
we
do
not
think,
is
pertinent
in
fixing
the
remedy.
it
may
make
the
remedy
harder
to
administer,
it
may
make
it
harder
to
endure
but
it
also
makes
it
more
necessary.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
assume
--
you
mean
--
assuming
--
assuming
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
even
more
would
--
would
be
--
be
necessary
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
will
meet
this
question
of
paying
tribute
of
whether
it'd
be
any
hardship
but
assuming
for
a
minute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
assuming
for
a
minute
that
it
would
cost
the
money
that
put
this
thing
through.
then
the
anti
--
if
the
antitrust
policy
is
that
these
businesses
shouldn't
be
restraining
trade,
why,
the
fact
that
it's
--
that
someone's
got
to
pay
something,
presumably
they
will
get
it
back
more
and
more
through
the
divestment
in
the
end,
it's
a
--
it's
a
temporary
loss
rather
than
a
permanent
loss.
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
fact
--
in
fact,
they
might
be
able
to
elect
the
congress
which
would
--
which
should
make
an
exception
in
the
antitrust
laws
to
take
care
of
it
too.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
or
at
least
in
the
internal
revenue
laws.
mr.
john
f.
davis
which
of
the
--
that's
--
that's
not
good
for
general
motors.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
both
house
if
--
are
not
true.
i
think
that
--
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
this
divestiture
is
not
--
is
--
is
not
good
--
i
mean
that
we
maintain
this
situation
isn't
good
for
anybody.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
the
second
reason,
the
appellee
say
that
this
is
an
abnormal
situation
is
because
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
i
say
that
if
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
it
--
it
may
--
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
it
is
--
let's
say
roughly
a
million,
and
i
mean
counting
indirect
holdings
of
the
two
--
of
the
two
corporations.
let's
assume
for
the
purpose
of
the
argument,
and
it's
not
particularly
accurate
but
it's
close
enough.
but
there
are
about
700,000
people
directly
or
indirectly
interested
in
the
stock
of
general
motors
and
about
300,000,
let's
say,
in
du
pont.
so
we're
dealing
with
a
million
of
people.
mr.
john
f.
davis
a
lot
of
people.
and
when
you
multiply
as
the
appellees
do,
the
tax
drops
in
market
by
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
the
numbers
of
shares
involve
you
--
you
work
up
for
sizeable
sums.
but
my
point
is
merely
this.
that
this
size
also
goes
to
the
effect
of
whatever
antitrust
restrictions
there
are
here
that
it's
the
very
size
of
these
two
corporations
and
they
are
tying
together
makes
it
tremendously
more
a
greater
economic
effect
and
as
though
you
have
the
lobsterman
in
--
in
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
it's
the
size
of
the
corporations
and
the
importance
of
the
corporations
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
the
number
of
shareholders
but
not
the
--
the
amount
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
the
second
--
the
second
basis
for
this
is
being
an
abnormal
case
is
that
the
acquisition
occurred
about
40
years
ago,
and
this
is
an
unusual
factor
in
the
section
7
case.
and
it
does
make
it
more
difficult
to
undo
what
happened
40
years
ago.
but
again,
it
also
makes
it
more
necessary
to
have
divestiture
because
the
relationships
between
the
two
companies
have
become
that
more
--
much
more
intimate
and
that
much
more
difficult
to
--
to
cure.
if
you're
having
new
acquisition,
so
far
the
--
where
the
two
corporations
have
not
worked
together,
it's
relatively
simple
thing,
and
--
and
it's
conceivable
that
--
that
if
you
--
if
you
prevent
voting
and
you
have
no
other
relationships,
this
will
cure
the
situation
but
it
isn't
much
less
like
this
as
this
will
happen
when
you
have
40
years
of
--
of
both
connection
between
the
two
corporations.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
not
--
not
if
congress
intended
that
divestiture
should
be
the
method
to
be
followed.
if
it's
mandatory,
of
course,
not.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
is
not
mandatory,
then
the
--
the
government
is
--
would
certainly
doesn't
want
to
use
the
divestiture
or
any
method
of
relief
as
it
club
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws.
it's
perfectly
willing
that
the
--
that
the
corporation
should
work
out
--
the
best
method
from
its
--
from
its
point
of
view
of
curing,
curing
the
violation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
--
it
has
been
estimated
that's
--
there
is
testimony
to
that
--
to
this
effect.
its
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
how
much
is
actually
receive
depends
on
the
--
depends
on
what
the
market
price
as
the
time
it's
divested
and
the
methods
of
divestiture.
and
we
--
as
i
shall
point
out
later
i
think
there
are
ways
of
divestiture
where
this
amount
is
cut
way,
way
down
below
that.
but
if
it
were
divested
through
dividends,
straight
dividends,
with
the
sale
of
the
--
sale
of
the
delaware
and
christiana
stock,
then
the
tax
is
--
would
be
and
about
in
that
neighborhood
if
the
price
stays
around
45
of
general
motors
stock.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
it
--
if
it
--
it
is
less
than
45
for
any
reason
the
tax
will
be
less.
that
is
right.
i'll
turn
now
to
the
second
point
of
my
argument
and
that
is
whether
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
but
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
not
--
not
when
the
clayton
--
no
--
in
the
sherman
act
violation
is
the
merger
type
of
violation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
there
are
many
violations
of
the
sherman
act
which
would
not
require
divestiture
because
the
heart
of
the
thing
isn't
the
merger
between
--
of
anything
like
this
kind.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
section
--
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
because
the
clayton
act
goes
to
the
tendency
and
--
it's
--
the
--
the
degree
of
proof
is
--
is
much
less.
mr.
john
f.
davis
under
--
in
clayton
act,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
under
clayton
--
well,
under
clayton
act
there
has
to
be
the
tend
--
there
has
to
be
proof
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
that
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
on
--
in
the
line
of
commerce,
under
the
clayton
act
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
under
section
11
or
15
which
both
enforce
section
7.
section
7
outlaws
acquisitions
of
stock
which
tend
to
create
a
monopoly
in
any
line
of
commerce,
and
you
have
to
prove
that
or
else
to
restraints.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
wouldn't
consider
the
violation
of
the
--
of
the
sherman
act.
the
clayton
act
pinpoints
and
goes
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
and
i
think
it
would
be
under
the
sherman
act.
i
think
that
whenever
the
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
whenever
the
evil
is
the
merger
evil,
whenever
what
is
causing
the
antitrust
result
is
the
acquisition
of
stock
by
one
corporation
of
another
which
leads
to
restraints
or
leads
the
monopoly.
that
then
the
cure
under
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act
will
be
divestiture
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
what's
been
done.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
not
--
well,
if
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
this
--
as
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
as
interpreted
by
this
court
when
the
heart
of
the
violation
is
the
acquisition,
then
it
does
require
it.
that
is
what
was
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
that
--
that's
true,
that
the
--
the
statute
doesn't
say
so.
but
the
statute
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
say
that
the
--
that
the
statute
in
adopting
the
same
language
of
sherman
act
which
had
been
interpreted
this
way
means
that
this
should
be
the
relief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
must
be
the
relief.
mr.
john
f.
davis
must
be
the
relief.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
decree
which
the
district
court
ordered
provides
adequate
relief.
intercorporate
marriages
are
--
are
complex
relationships.
it
doesn't
suffice
to
say
that
corporations
are
managed
by
their
officers
and
the
officers
are
chosen
by
the
directors,
and
the
directors
are
elected
by
the
stockholders
and
then
if
you
cut
the
line
at
any
place
you
--
you've
broken
the
control.
what
we
have
here
is
a
deeply
ingrained
combination
of
too
extensive
and
very
complicated
business
corporations.
no
one
would
deny
that
in
the
early
20s,
the
du
pont
corporation,
not
only
exercise
the
controlling
influence
of
general
motors,
but
in
the
words
of
its
own
officials,
it
had
working
control
of
general
motors.
from
the
time
when
it
first
made
its
investment
in
general
motors,
du
pont
accepted
the
chief
responsibility
for
the
general
motors'
financing.
from
time
to
time,
it
suggested
or
vetoed
appointments
to
the
board
of
directors
or
to
the
slate
of
officers
of
general
motors.
when
necessary,
it
is
intervened
in
its
--
in
its
day
to
day
activities
with
respect
to
whether
it
is
given
sufficient
use
to
du
pont
products
in
this
kind
of
relationship
that's
going
on
in
one
way
or
another
to
one
degree
or
another
for
40
years.
now,
the
decree
of
the
district
court
would
try
to
end
all
of
these
by
enjoining
interlocking
directors,
by
transferring
du
pont's
right
to
vote
the
g.m.
stock
to
its
stockholders
and
by
enjoining
certain
specific
business
relationships
which
the
court
believed
to
be
particularly
dangerous.
now,
the
fault
with
this
game
is
that
at
least
untouched
the
real
heart
of
the
matter.
du
pont
will
continue
to
hold,
as
an
investment,
stock
worth
$2.5
to
$3.5
billion
from
which
it
receives
about
30%
of
its
income
each
year.
it
owned
63
million
shares.
it
gets
$2
a
share
as
regular
dividends,
gets
about
a
$126
million
a
year
of
income
from
du
pont.
now,
it
is
not
possible
to
conceive
of
these
two
corporations
really
dealing
with
each
other
as
strangers
under
these
circumstances.
general
motors
cannot
feel
free
to
buy
its
paint
from
a
du
pont
competitor
or
to
make
its
own
plastics
of
fabrics
or
to
go
into
competition
with
du
pont
in
manufacturing
a
gasoline
additive
or
--
or
antifreeze.
the
first
impediment
to
this
freedom
is
the
fact
that
even
with
the
sterilization
of
the
delaware
and
the
christiana
stock,
at
least
15%
of
general
motors
voting
rights
will
continue
to
be
tied
up
with
the
stockholders
of
--
of
du
pont.
there
will
be
a
group
of
these
stockholders
who
have
a
common
interest
which
is
different
from
the
interest
of
the
general
motors
stockholders
generally.
and
i
suggest
that
there
will
be
circumstances
under
which
--
even
without
any
formal
combination
of
these
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
led
general
interest
in
one
direction
will
lead
them
to
cast
their
votes
in
the
--
in
a
certain
tend
to
lead
them
to
cast
their
votes
in
a
certain
way
which
would
be
advantageous
to
them
particularly.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
would,
during
the
period
of
divestiture,
who
would
temporarily
place
within
the
same
people
rather
than
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
it
would
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
--
well,
they
--
they
would
get
it
initially.
but
it
isn't
tied
together
and
it
would
gradually
--
it
would
gradually
dissipate.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
the
--
the
real
fault
with
this
system
is
that
it
ties
these
two
things
together
in
perpetuity.
if
one
du
pont
stockholder
sells
his
stock
in
the
market
and
the
new
man
comes
in,
he
immediately
picks
up
the
interest
in
--
in
general
motors,
he
picks
up
the
right
to
vote
1
1/3
share
for
each
share
that
he
finds,
whereas
in
the
situation
where
you
have
a
divestment
by
distributing
the
stocks,
stocks
separating
it,
this
will
gradually
disperse
itself.
now,
in
some
of
the
antitrust
cases,
it
was
felt
that
it
was
improper
to
--
to
divest
by
giving
the
stock
to
the
stockholders
because
it
was
felt
that
this
continuing
control
by
the
same
people
would
have
this
--
this
evil
effect.
the
government
has
not
suggested
that
in
this
case
except
with
respect
to
delaware
and
christiana
which
are
so
closely
tied
in
with
the
--
with
the
du
pont
history.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
sterilized
the
votes
entirely.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
so
that
there
is
no
voting
power
on
those
at
all.
i
use
that
as
a
shorthand
expression.
it's
more
than
the
delaware
and
the
christiana
stock,
it's
also
the
--
the
stock
held
by
their
officers
and
directors
in
--
but
--
it's
roughly
20
million
shares.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
does
--
it
does
suggest
that
and
it
suggested
in
all
three
briefs.
this
would
be
some
help.
i
mean
it
would
end
any
--
it
would
end
any
effect
of
the
voting
power
of
these
--
to
the
--
of
the
shares
and
to
that
extent,
it
would
--
would
help
the
matter.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
we
would
not
think
that
even
then,
you
have
completely
divided
the
interest
of
these
corporations.
lines
of
--
these
lines
of
corporate
relationship
don't
extend
only
through
--
through
voting
power
than
they
--
there
are
about
as
many
subterranean
lines
of
--
of
influence
between
one
corporation
and
another
is
--
is
there
are
in
the
surface.
and
remember
that
even
if
you
cut
off
the
voting
power,
du
pont
will
continue
to
have
--
still
rely
on
general
motors
for
$126
million
of
income
annually.
they
--
they
must
be
concerned
with
what's
going
in
--
in
du
pont
whether
they
have
such
--
in
general
motors
when
they
have
such
a
tremendous
investment.
how
their
influence
would
be
--
would
be
exercise?
it's
hard
to
tell.
it
could
be
exercised
through
--
through
their
common
financial
advice.
both
companies
who
had
morgan
--
had
morgan
stanley
as
the
regular
investment
factors.
i'm
--
i
--
i
don't
know
that
this
would
happen
but
it's
--
it's
entirely
probable
that
if
du
pont
was
unhappy
with
something
that
was
going
in
general
motors
that
someone
in
morgan
stanley
would
--
would
speak
to
general
motors
and
suggest
that
maybe
it
would
be
better
if
it
were
done
differently.
or
it
maybe
that
the
--
maybe
that
they
would
be
concerned
about
whether
or
not
du
pont
would
be
willing
to
give
them
his
favorable
contracts
with
respect
to
chemicals
and
--
and
plastics
as
they
would
otherwise
give
them.
or
maybe
it
would
be
that
they
would
have
in
mind
that
there
about
300,000
stockholders
of
du
pont
who
were
particularly
concern
with
this
relationship
and
the
--
perhaps
this
people
and
their
wives
and
their
families
and
the
businesses
which
they
manage
would
turn
to
buying
fords
or
plymouths
if
suddenly
general
motors
should
start
painting
their
--
painting
their
chevrolets
with
--
with
the
competitors'
paint.
the
lines
--
the
lines
of
communication
are
--
are
enormous
and
it's
hard
to
tell
how
this
influence
would
percolate
through
but
the
weight
of
it
is
such
that
it
would
be
pretty
sure
ought
to
be
felt.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
administering
its
statute
says
several
of
them
in
which
the
question
of
control
is
important,
it
appears
in
the
securities
act
and
it
appears
very
prominently
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
in
the
public
utility
holdings.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
also
a
[laughter]
--
they
also
have
a
very
real
interest
in
the
prosperity
of
du
pont,
these
stockholders
do.
and
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
well,
if
it's
a
clean
cut
decision
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
if
there's
no
question
that
the
du
pont
paint
is
going
to
peel
off
and
the
new
paint
is
going
to
last
forever,
nobody
can
fit.
but
these
--
but
these
decisions
must
be
--
we
must
assume
that
there
--
there
are
relatively
close
decisions
as
a
matter
of
judgement
--
matters
of
judgement.
and
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
du
pont
stockholders
are
going
to
be
distinctly
unhappy
when
they
see
this
large
piece
of
--
when
they
read
in
the
manuals
about
the
--
the
chevrolet
cost
of
--
have
a
brand
new
paint
and
they
find
this
isn't
du
pont
paint,
there
are
going
to
be
about
308
of
these
potential
buyers
of
--
of
chevrolet
cars
and
they're
going
to
be
distinctly
unhappy
about
it,
and
this
isn't
the
way
to
--
to
--
this
is
something
which
is
a
way
in
the
minds
of
general
motors'
management.
they
--
they're
not
going
to
be
anxious
to
--
to
lose
this
--
this
interest.
mr.
john
f.
davis
[laughs]
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
it
might
well
cut
both
ways.
they
might
feel
they
were
buying
from
their
own
corporation
and
so
it
was
to
their
own
advantage.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
is
--
it
is
hard
to
balance
these
things.
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
trying
to
foresee
exactly
how
this
thing
could
--
would
work.
i
am
merely
saying
that
these
two
corporations
are
not
going
to
be
strangers
to
each
other
and
that
these
considerations
that
they're
going
to
have
to
be
balanced
by
the
managements
of
both
in
all
their
decisions.
and
that
this
is
not
a
--
this
is
not
a
severing
of
this
relationship
even
if
you
cut
up
the
votes.
it's
just
a
suppressing
of
it.
it
is
suggested
that
if
these
things
do
happen
that
we
can
then
go
to
the
court
and
get
further
relief
and
a
specific
provision
is
included
in
the
--
in
the
decrees
so
that
we
can.
i
don't
really
get
much
comfort
out
of
this.
we
weren't
able,
in
our
main
case,
to
prove
any
actual
restraints
by
du
pont
over
general
motors.
whether
they
existed
or
not,
we
couldn't
prove
that
they
were
actual
restraints.
i
don't
think
that
we
would
have
much
more
luck
in
proving
restraints
if
they
did
exist
in
the
future.
they
--
it's
a
very
hard
problem
of
proof.
and
even
if
we
could
prove
them,
it
would
probably
take
four
or
fives
years
if
--
if
the
history
of
this
particular
proceeding
is
--
of
relief
is
any
--
is
any
example.
so
i
don't
think
that,
really,
to
say
that
we
can
get
relief
if
it
doesn't
work,
is
any
substitute
for
giving
us
adequate
relief
at
the
present
time.
"but,"
say
the
appellees,
"the
relief
ordered
is
appropriate
because
divestiture
would
be
disastrous".
now,
the
--
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
nothing
of
inherent
value
is
destroyed
by
divestiture.
general
motors
will
be
released
from
any
obligation
which
it
now
as
to
du
pont.
in
du
pont,
while
it
may
lose
--
while
it
will
lose
the
illegal
advantages,
it
is
achieved
through
acquisition,
will
be
relieved
of
the
not
inconsiderable
problem
of
trying
to
run
not
only
a
huge
chemical
industry
but
also
of
the
largest
manufacturing
complex
that
there
is
in
the
country.
let's
say
the
appellees,
the
income
taxes
which
will
be
imposed
on
the
recipients
of
the
general
motors
stocks,
when
--
when
it
has
distributed
its
dividends,
will
be
an
unfair
burden
on
what
is
in
effect
a
return
of
capital.
well,
this
is
just
the
wrong
forum
to
complain
about
the
unfairness
of
taxation.
that
is
a
legislative
manner
and
not
a
judicial
one.
if
congress,
in
its
wisdom,
feels
that
to
transform
an
indirect
interest
in
general
motors
stock
into
a
direct
interest
in
general
motors
stock
is
a
taxable
transaction,
which
under
the
tax
law
should
be
imposed,
then
it's
not
--
it's
no
function
of
the
--
of
the
district
court
to
try
and
prevent
this
from
occurring.
to
be
sure,
du
pont
should
be
given
freedom
within
the
decree
to
arrange
its
business
in
anyway
that
it
can
to
reduce
the
impact
of
these
taxes,
just
as
they
can
in
any
of
their
other
financial
transactions.
but
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
taxes
themselves,
the
--
the
very
considerable
taxes
should
be
used
as
a
club
to
enforce
the
antitrust
laws.
but
we
think
that
it's
--
the
impact
--
the
fact
they
have
to
pay
on
this
particular
transaction
is
a
matter
for
them
to
take
to
congress.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it's
--
yes,
it's
irrelevant
--
it's
irrelevant
--
it's
hard
to
say
yes
or
no.
it's
irrelevant
in
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
they're
not
totally
irrelevant
in
the
sense
that
--
and
this
is
what
i
mean
that
the
government
should
not
order,
shouldn't
seek
a
particular
decree
without
being
conscious
of
what
the
types
of
consequences
are
so
that
if
there
is
another
method
which
accomplishes
the
end
equally,
this
matter
should
be
--
should
be
considered
and
the
--
and
the
company
should
be
given
its
right
to
choose
the
lesser
of
these
two
methods.
unless
one
method
is
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
it
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion
in
--
in
molding
the
decree.
i
think
that
this
court,
at
many
times,
held
that
the
district
courts
must
be
given
a
good
deal
of
discretion.
but
i
think
there
are
limits
to
it.
now,
think
that
it's
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
they
have
a
relevant
share
in
this
respect
that
an
order
should
not
be
entered
which
needlessly
imposes
tax
consequences.
this
is
what
judge
wyzanski
said
in
the
minnesota
mining
case
that
when
there
are
two
or
three
methods,
in
--
in
that
case,
he
changed
the
decree
when
he
--
when
the
tax
consequences
were
pointed
out
to
him.
he
said,
"there
is
no
need
of
making
an
order
in
this
particular
way
because
it
will
have
these
tax
consequences."
and
in
this
respect,
it's
--
it's
appropriate
to
know
what
is
--
what
is
going
on.
what
--
what
the
tax
consequences
are.
but
--
and
the
decree
should
be
framed
so
as
to
allow
the
company
to
minimize
this.
but
that's
--
that's
as
far
as
i
think
it
can
go
in
this.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
actually
--
actually
i'm
not
sure
that
this
court
should
--
should
assume
that
the
tax
consequences
at
the
time
of
divestiture
will
be
the
same
as
they
are
today.
congress
has
in
the
past
been
quite
sympathetic
to
the
pleas
for
--
for
relief
against
this
involuntarily
--
involuntary
type
of
conversion.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
but
i
think
you
can
take
into
consideration
that
if
the
--
the
congress
may
well
not
act
instantly
in
this
situation.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
i
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
in
tax
legislations
introduced
the
last
session
of
congress,
of
course,
there
was
senate,
200
and
there
was
a
house
bill
on
the
thing
too.
i
think
no
one
pressed
it
very
hard.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
last
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
now,
i
come
to
the
next
argument
that
the
innocent
stockholders
are
going
to
suffer
disastrous
loses
because
of
the
drop
in
market
values
of
both
general
motors
and
du
pont
stock.
in
a
minute,
i
shall
deal
with
the
--
with
the
merits
of
this,
but
for
the
present,
let
me
accept
the
appellees
evidence
at
its
full
value
just
for
the
purposes
of
argument.
their
evidence
is
that
divestiture
under
the
government's
plan,
that
is,
the
through
--
through
dividends
--
through
declaring
dividends
of
the
general
motors
stock
that
the
divestiture
would
impair
general
motors
the
--
market
value
of
general
motors
stock
to
the
extent
of
20%
to
25%.
and
that
it
would
impair
the
value
of
the
du
pont
stock
market
wise
25%
to
30%.
now,
no
one
wants
to
depress
stock
market
values
to
any
extent.
but
even
if
this
drop
should
occur,
i
suggest
that
it's
not
the
other
disaster
that
the
appellees
would
have
you
believe.
during
the
year
1960,
general
motors
fell
off
27%
from
its
high
of
the
year
to
the
low
of
the
year,
and
du
pont
dropped
33%
from
the
high
of
the
year
to
the
low
of
the
year.
the
innocent
stockholders,
so
far
as
i
know,
haven't
treated
this
as
a
disaster.
i
mean
no
one
is
happy
to
see
his
stock
go
down,
but
the
way
--
the
way
you
make
it
appear
as
a
disaster
is
to
take
this
--
take
this
drop
in
stock
market
values
and
--
and
multiply
it
by
the
number
of
shares
outstanding
and
you
get
the
astronomical
figures.
but
actually
--
actually,
there
are
fluctuations
up
and
down
in
the
stock
market.
what
--
so
that
even
if
we
accept
their
argument
that
there
will
be
this
drop
in
this
--
in
the
--
in
the
stockmarket,
it
--
it
isn't
a
factor
which
should
frighten
us.
i
mean
it's
something
that
we
may
want
to
avoid
that
we
can
but
it's
something
that
isn't,
by
itself,
disastrous.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
stockholders,
of
course,
when
they
--
when
they
buy
common
stock,
pick
the
chances
of
gains
and
losses.
it
doesn't
really
make
much
difference
to
them
whether
the
loss
occurs
because
of
an
antitrust
decree
or
bad
weather
or
an
international
disturbances
--
disturbance.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
far
as
the
antitrust
decree
goes,
it
may
be
less
serious
to
them
because
in
that
case,
as
here,
nothing
is
taken
away
from
their
corporation's
earnings
or
--
or
dividends
other
than
the
dividends
of
separating.
but
nothing
is
done
to
the
business
entities
so
that
they
cannot
continue
to
earn
same
kind
of
--
of
profits
that
happened
before
and
the
stock
market
is
thereupon
not
reflecting
inherent
worth,
it's
merely
reflecting
a
matter
of
supply
and
demand.
this
isn't
much
comfort
if
they
have
to
sell
immediately
but
it
is
some
comfort
if
they
are
like
the
big
trust
and
so
forth
that
can
just
--
just
hold
on
and
let
the
--
whatever
market
disturbance
there
is
right
itself.
but
i
think
that
the
argument
that
the
general
motors
and
the
du
pont
stock
will
fall
off
20%
to
30%
by
reason
of
divestiture
is,
on
its
face,
unsound.
general
motors'
earnings
--
well,
earnings
and
the
$2
dividend
which
is
paid
over
the
past
few
years
will
not
be
affected
by
this
decree
in
any
material
effect.
and
nether
will
du
pont's
earnings
or
its
dividend
except
that
general
motors
is
taken
out
of
it.
now,
to
me,
it's
--
it's
inconceivable
that
private
and
institutional
investors
which
are
for
primarily
concern
with
the
yield
of
stocks
would
fail
to
come
into
the
market
and
buy
in
very
large
volume,
if
the
price
of
general
motors
fails
so
that
you
could
get
a
yield
of
5.5%
or
6%
on
--
on
a
blue-chip
investment
like
that.
the
record
is
replete
with
evidence
as
to
the
interest
of
particularly
institutional
investors
of
growing
interest
in
--
in
equity
securities.
and
if
--
if
they
have
a
chance
to
--
to
buy
either
one
of
these
securities
that
are
rate
rather
produced
between
5.5%
and
6%,
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
they
will
--
will
come
in
and
this
will
--
will
--
seems
obvious
would
stop
the
fall
of
this
stock
façade
of
what
the
--
the
appellees
would
have
its
belief.
the
testimony
of
the
appellees'
experts
which
led
the
district
court
to
accept
the
theory
that
there
would
be
disastrous
falls
in
the
market
price
was
specifically
addressed
to
a
particular
plan
of
divestiture.
now,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
on
this
appeal
that
there
are
various
combinations
of
divestiture
which
should
be
left
open
to
the
--
to
the
appellees.
and
we
believe
that
if
they
are
given
the
--
the
freedom
and
if
they
really
put
their
shoulder
to
the
wheel
that
they
will
be
able
to
avoid
some
of
these
difficulties
which
they
foresee.
for
example
on
the
tax
consequences,
if
they
substitute
their
du
pont
--
their
general
motors
dividend
for
part
of
their
present
cash
dividend,
so
that
instead
of
paying
$2
--
instead
of
paying
$6.50
dividends,
they
now
pay
$4
in
cash
and
$2.50
in
--
in
stock,
there
will
be
no
increase
in
the
income
tax
burden
on
the
--
on
the
du
pont
stockholders.
they
will
have
the
same
overall
cash
burden
that
they
had
before.
the
company
can,
if
it
--
if
it
will,
sell
a
good
part
of
the
stock
either
through
private
placements,
perhaps
to
general
motors,
perhaps
to
other
purchases
or
it
can
make
a
secondary
distribution
as
was
so
successfully
done
with
the
slowing
stock
in
1957.
and
i
think
even
more
important,
general
motors
can,
if
it
wish,
divest
itself
of
a
very
considerable
portion
of
this
stock
by
making
exchange
office
of
the
general
motors
stock
to
its
own
stockholders
in
return
for
their
stock.
now,
this
will
have
the
obvious
advantage
that
it
will
reduce
their
capitalization
more
or
less
in
proportion
to
the
--
to
the
reduced
--
reduction
in
--
in
the
assets.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
wasn't
spelled
out.
we
were
asked
to
provide
a
particular
plan
and
they're
not
incorporated
in
our
plan,
but
throughout
our
arguments
in
the
district
court,
we
argue
that
any
methods
of
divestiture
that
could
be
--
that
they
could
work
out
would
be
--
would
be
desirable
and
--
and
would
be
acceptable
to
the
government.
the
plans
--
the
specific
plans
did
not
include
these
matters.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
there's
been
no
ruling
nor
receive
--
there
was
no
ruling
out
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
then,
certainly
before
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
before
it
was
done,
a
ruling
would
have
to
be
honest.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
it
would
not
be
so
held.
i
mean
the
--
the
nature
of
it
is
very
different
from
the
dividend,
then
i
think
it
would
not
be
held
to
be
a
dividend.
as
a
matter
fact
on
the
exchange
offer,
it's
interesting
that
in
the
--
in
the
christiana-delaware
merger
proposal,
which
was
approved
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
i
think
in
january
and
which
will
be
voted
on
by
the
stockholders
of
those
two
companies
in
--
later
this
week,
the
proposal
is
to
merge
delaware
and
christiana.
and
one
of
the
assets
which
is
involve
in
--
in
this
merger,
300,000
shares
of
hercules
powder
company,
which
delaware
holds.
and
for
some
reason,
and
i
don't
pretend
i
know
the
reason
of
why,
there
is
a
feeling
that's
inappropriate
for
this
merged
corporation
to
hold
the
du
pont
powder,
there
is
some
--
some
apprehension
about
the
antitrust
aspects
of
it.
so
it's
been
determined
that
this
will
be
divested.
and
the
plan
proposed
by
delaware
and
christiana
for
divesting
this
--
these
300
shares
of
--
of
hercules
powder
is
through
making
an
exchange
offer
to
the
--
to
the
stockholders
of
--
of
christiana.
i
don't
suggest
that
the
$16
million
which
were
involved
or
may
be
it's
$14
million
that's
involved
from
the
hercules
powder
case
is
the
same
as
this
case.
but
this
isn't
--
this
isn't
a
new
steam
to
this
people.
they
--
they
know
how
to
--
they
know
how
to
divest
stock
by
making
exchange
of
it
when
they
want
to.
now,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
decree
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
appropriate
that
this
court
include
in
its
order,
some
provision
to
prevent
the
case
from
going
back
to
the
district
court
for
another
four
or
five
years.
this
dispute
between
us
is
to
who's
responsible
for
this
delay.
i
don't
think
it's
important
who's
--
who's
responsible
for
the
delay.
the
--
the
public
is
the
one
that
is
hurt
by
the
antitrust
laws
not
being
carried
out.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
give
consideration
to
including
in
its
order
a
provision
that
the
dividends
on
the
du
pont
stock
on
the
general
motors
stock
be
held
up
if
divestiture
is
not
commenced
within
one
year,
after
the
order
of
this
court.
this
is
--
this
is
a
harsh
relief.
this
is
the
kind
of
relief
that
used
to
be
ordered
in
the
railroad
--
in
the
railroad
cases.
it
would
do
one
thing,
it
would
--
it
would
ensure
that
whoever
is
responsible
for
the
delay
in
the
past
that
there
would
be
promptness
in
--
in
framing
and
agreeing
to
a
decree.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
f.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
if
i
appraise
this
argument
correctly,
i
think
probably
the
most
significant
issue
before
the
court
at
the
present
time
in
it,
is
whether
or
not
the
decree
of
the
district
court
will
actually
give
adequate
relief.
if
the
district
court's
decree
will
not
give
adequate
relief,
then
it's
not
important
whether
or
not,
it
is
--
whether
the
statute
is
mandatory
or
not,
because
this
relief
shouldn't
be
followed.
and
if
the
relief
is
not
adequate,
it
also
does
not
make
any
difference
that
there
will
be
hardships
which
will
be
imposed
upon
the
people
who
are
involved.
so
that,
at
least
in
one
respect,
this
is
--
this
is
the
heart
of
the
case.
now,
mr.
cox's
persuasive
argument
on
this
issue
left
me
wondering
yesterday
afternoon
whether
perhaps,
i
might
not
be
wrong
in
whether
it
might
not
be
true
that
if
voting
rights
were
taken
away
that
du
pont
would
no
longer
have
any
power
to
control
general
motors.
but
then,
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
was
wrong,
that
i
was
in
good
company
because,
i
didn't
invent
the
idea
that
control
over
corporations
depends
upon
things
other
than
voting
rights.
this
isn't
a
novel
--
a
novel
concept.
there
are
very
large
pieces
of
the
studies
and
the
reports
of
the
--
technical
--
the
--
the
temporary
national
economic
committee
which
deals
with
this
very
subject,
volume
2
of
the
securities
&
exchange
commission's
report
on
protective
committees.
it
feels
with
the
same
thing
and
probably
the
--
the
patriarch
of
the
problem
of
how
corporations
can
be
run
is
any
pass
justice
of
this
court.
justice
brandeis
in
his
book,
other
people's
money
is
--
is
much
smaller
than
--
than
these
other
reports
on
this
thing,
but
it
carries
a
tremendous
impact.
and
the
theme,
the
theme
of
other
people's
money
is
that
the
bank
is
--
were
controlling
the
corporations.
and
justice
brandeis
didn't
think
the
bank
is
--
were
controlling
those
corporations
by
reason
of
stock
control.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
--
that
is
right,
it
doesn't.
but
when
you
--
this
is
where,
we
don't
answer
the
question
by
saying
we
cut
off
the
--
the
stock
control.
i
mean
that,
it
doesn't
automatically
say
we
cut
the
chain
and
therefore,
there
can
be
no
control.
there
are
other
methods
and
it
has
been
my
purpose
to
persuade
the
court
that
when
you
have
40
years
of
interrelationships,
when
you
have
a
company
which
has
every
motive
to
continue
to
control,
by
having
the
motive
i
mean
that
it's
--
that
it's
got
two
and
a
half
to
three
and
a
half
billion
dollars
tied
up
in
the
enterprise.
it's
got
$126,000,000
a
year
as
dividends
coming
in
from
the
enterprise.
it
has
every
--
every
motive
to
--
to
want
that
corporation
to
do
well
and
if
it
thinks
it's
not
doing
well
to
try
to
stare
it
in
--
in
the
positive
things
that
should
go.
so
that
i
say,
you
have
40
years
of
--
of
influence
of
one
kind
or
another,
you
have
the
continuing
motive
to
exercise
that
influence.
and
i'm
persuaded
that
there
are
methods
in
which
that
they
can
continue
to
--
to
have
this
felt.
now,
it
doesn't
mean
next
year,
one
of
the
ways
of
the
course,
is
through
the
votes
of
their
stockholders.
but,
it
doesn't
mean
that
this
year
or
next
year,
general
motors
is
going
to
come
to
some
shop
turning
of
the
way
and
that
it's
going
to
have
a
definite
problem
of
what
du
pont
is
going
to
do
about
it.
this
is
--
but
this
is
a
continuing
pressure
from
du
pont
on
general
motors
as
the
scheme
has
worked
out,
these
stocks
are
tied
together
in
such
a
way
that
no
individual
stockholder
can
separate
his
interest.
any
person
who
buys
an
interest
in
du
pont
is
going
to
buy
an
interest
in
general
motors.
and
that's
going
to
continue
just
as
long
as
this
--
as
this
decree
is
in
effect.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
that
will
--
that
will
reduce
any
--
any
influence
which
would
come
from
the
exercising
the
voting
rights.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
doesn't
reduce
the
motive.
it
doesn't
reduce
the
interest
of
general
--
of
du
pont
in
general
motors.
it
doesn't
--
it
doesn't
change
the
--
the
thought
there's
still
--
there's
still
a
desire
to
have
been
due
as
the
--
as
the
direct
--
as
the
du
pont
would
want
them
to
do.
but
it
does
cut
off
in
the
direct
voting
control.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
it's
--
well,
it
has
the
same
effect
as
sterilizing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
--
i
may
say
that
whenever
we're
sterilizing
stock
value
--
a
stock
voting
power,
we're
running
somewhat
contrary
to
--
to
what
people
believe
today
as
corporate
democracy.
you're
--
you're
turning
over
to
the
management,
the
power
to
manage
without
any
direction
in
the
whole
object
of
the
securities
&
exchange
commission
in
its
proxy
regulations
and
so
forth,
is
to
get
more
direction,
more
responsibility
to
the
owners
of
a
corporation
rather
than
less.
so
that,
on
a
technical
basis
when
you
--
whenever
which
sterilizing
any
stock
of
this
kind,
we
have
--
running
against
the
trend
of
corporate
democracy.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
that's
--
as
far
as
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
to
direct
--
any
direct
open
control
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
the
corporate
democracy
would
be
by
part
of
the
owners
and
part
of
the
owners
would
--
part
of
the
owners
of
the
--
of
the
stock
would
by
hypothesis,
have
no
sale
anymore.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
those
--
on
the
antitrust
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
from
the
antitrust
position,
those
are
the
ones
we
say
should
not
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
have
it.
we
think
it
is
a
preferable
--
a
preferable
remedy
--
far
preferable
remedy,
beside
from
the
fact
that
i
--
that
i
do
not
believe
that
would
be
effective.
it
would
be
a
far
preferable
remedy
to
distribute
the
stocks
so
that
the
owners
could
continue
to
have
their
--
have
a
control
of
what's
done
with
their
money.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no.
no,
i
don't
say
it
was
--
well,
it
was
beyond
its
power,
if
we
take
the
views
that
the
statute
is
mandatory.
and
if
we
(voice
overlap)
then
--
then
we
have
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
so
that
we
come
then
to
the
question
of
what
the
area
of
discretion
is
in
the
district
court
if
--
if
there
is
a
choice
in
remedies.
now
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes
--
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
in
the
first
place,
i
think
that
you
can
have
not
only
statutory
limitations
on
the
discretion.
you
can
have
judicial
limitations
on
the
discretion.
and
if
this
court
has
decided
as
i
think
it
did
in
the
international
boxing
case
and
in
the
crescent
amusement
company
case,
that
in
these
cases
where
you
have
a
merger
situation,
then
there
must
be
divestiture
in
order
to
cure
it.
that
this
is
the
heart
of
the
case
and
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
the
crescent
amusement
case
and
in
the
boxing
case.
then
these
two
will
limit
the
--
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
in
--
in
what
it
would
do
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
john
f.
davis
but
this
again
is
a
mandatory
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
then,
the
question
comes.
if
this
is
not
so,
but
that
this
--
but
the
court
had
a
pre
hand
and
that
the
--
and
that
this
court
was
only
speaking
of
specific
cases
and
not
meaning
to
--
to
limit
discretion
of
the
district
court
with
respect
to
the
cases
generally.
then,
i
think
our
problem
is
whether
or
not,
the
district
court
properly
appraised
this
evidence.
and
when
mr.
stern
speaks
of,
if
having
of
that
rule
52
--
is
it
52?
and
the
fact
that
if
it's
supported
by
any
evidence,
then
this
court
shall
not
overrule
it,
i
think
that
this
really
doesn't
carry
much
weight
in
this
type
of
a
case
where
the
type
of
evidence
which
is
involved
its
expert
testimony
of
the
kind
which
is
here
involved.
i
think
that
even
though
hundreds
of
witnesses,
expert
witnesses
are
called
in
du
pont
and
general
motors
to
have
call
as
many
as
they
felt
was
effective
to
give
these
estimates
of
market
value
and
what
--
what
the
--
what
the
effect
on
general
motors
and
du
pont
stockholders
would
be,
i
think
that
the
court
below
could've
disregarded
this
and
--
and
followed
the
concepts
of
its
own
--
of
its
own
judgment
and
i
think
this
court
in
appraising
what
the
district
court
did,
can
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
--
i
think
i
did
stray
away
from
the
point
and
i
think
you
state
it
correctly.
i
think
that
this
court
had
said
many
times
that
in
--
by
framing
decrees
and
these
antitrust
cases
that
the
primary
duty
is
on
the
district
court
and
not
in
this
court.
and,
i
think
i'd
get
nowhere
to
argue
that
that
was
not
so.
so
i
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that
is
right.
you
--
you
would
have
to
--
you
would
--
the
judgment
is
a
judgment
for
the
district
court
primarily.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
think
it
was
a
not
allowable
exercise
of
discretion,
because
i
think
that
on
the
base
of
it,
this
does
not
give
adequate
relief.
this
does
not
prevent
the
continuation
of
the
--
of
the
evil
which
supposed
to
be
eliminated.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
it
is.
and
it's
a
question
of
decree.
it's
a
question
of
decree.
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
--
i
didn't
--
i
didn't
mean
that.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
--
that
is
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
it
does
come
down
to
that.
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
this
court
should
give
very
great
weight
to
what
the
district
court
did.
but
i
think
if
you
read
the
district
court's
decree,
if
you
read
its
findings,
you
will
feel
that
they
went
beyond
the
discretion
which
the
district
court
had
in
framing
a
decree.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
we
--
we
--
i
think
that
as
mr.
stern
stated
that
quite
accurately,
we
say
if
we
disagree
with
the
findings,
we
think
the
court
made
improper
findings
on
that.
we
think
the
evidence
--
pardon?
mr.
john
f.
davis
yes,
i
think
we
do.
we
say
that
the
--
the
losses
that
the
court
improperly
found,
appraised
the
evidence
in
finding
that
these
losses
would
occur,
that
these
losses
are
not
inherent
in
divestiture.
we
say
to
the
court
for
example,
used
the
wrong
--
the
wrong
standards.
the
court
considered
whether
or
not,
a
particular
and
it
considered
evidence
which
was
addressed
to
a
particular
method
of
divestiture.
we
say
that
if
any
method
of
divestiture
can
be
worked
out
which
is
effective,
then
it
is
preferable
to
--
to
the
plan
which
the
court
adopted.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
it
isn't
the
medical
case.
it's
more
like
the
case
that
was
before
the
court
on
the
merits.
we
--
we've
challenged
the
fact
that
there
will
be
as
larger
tax
impact
as
the
court
found.
we've
challenged
the
fact
that
there
will
be
as
large
market
losses
as
the
court
found.
we
do
not
challenge
--
there's
no
--
there's
no
real
basis
to
challenge
the
individual
testimony.
we
don't
claim
that
anyone
was
lying
in
the
--
in
the
case,
so
that
actual
demonstrable
facts
are
wrong.
we
object
to
the
conclusions
which
were
drawn
from
it.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
and
we
think
that
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
think
that's
right
and
we
say
that
the
--
the
district
court's
guest
was
so
bad
that
that's
what
you
should
do.
that's
in
effect
what
we're
doing.
i
--
i
would
like
to
address
myself
too
to
this
--
just
very
briefly
to
the
relief
which
was
granted
under
the
sherman
act.
as
you
remember,
i
argued
that
by
lifting
section
4
of
the
sherman
act
and
making
it
the
relief
under
the
clayton
act,
that
congress
intended
the
same
type
if
relief
to
be
adopted.
and
the
--
mr.
cox
cited
today
that
showed
that
--
to
show
that
divestiture
was
not
required
under
the
sherman
act.
he
cited
the
terminal
company
of
st.
louis,
a
case
which
appears
in
224
u.s.
this
case
gives
me
some
trouble.
most
of
the
early
cases
are
straight
merger
cases
and
a
straight
dissolution.
the
terminal
company
of
st.
louis
was
a
case
in
which
a
group
of
interstate
railroads,
the
katy,
the
st.
louis
and
san
francisco,
baltimore
and
ohio
and
several
others,
combined
together
by
agreement
to
limit
the
access
to
the
study
of
st.
louis.
and
in
order
to
make
their
plan
effective,
they
joined
together
the
terminal
companies
in
the
--
into
the
terminal
company
of
st.
louis.
and
this
was
the
device
they
used
to
restrain
this
traffic.
i
treat
this
case
as
not
a
straight
merger
case.
i
treat
this
case
as
the
kind
of
a
case
where
a
group
of
corporations,
by
combination
conspiracy,
get
together
and
agree
to
work
out
a
system
of
restraining
commerce.
and
they
used
as
a
device
to
do
this,
the
terminal
company
of
st.
louis
which
is
a
corporation,
the
stock
of
which
is
owned.
and
the
question
was
raised
whether
this
would
have
to
be
divested.
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
court,
it
says
it
doesn't
have
to
be
divested.
this
isn't
the
heart
of
the
trouble.
it
isn't
the
case
of
their
buying
of
a
merger
case
as
we
have
here.
it's
a
case
of
a
combination
and
if
the
terminal
company
is
merely
used
as
a
device
to
carry
out
the
combination.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
there
was
no
merger
between
the
katy,
the
st.
louis
to
san
francisco.
then
the
main
--
the
--
the
main
people
who
combined,
there
was
no
merger
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
insofar
as
there
was
a
combination,
this
court
said
that
must
cease.
mr.
john
f.
davis
if
so,
i
don't
--
i
don't
have
notes
on
that.
i
don't
know.
mr.
john
f.
davis
well,
i
shall
--
i
--
i
hope
that
they
did
but
they
said
what
i
have
just
said.
mr.
john
f.
davis
i
want
to
say
a
very
brief
word
about
the
impact
of
divestiture
on
--
on
the
interest
of
the
various
stockholders.
if
in
some
comments
that
if
it
were
divested
in
this
way
or
that,
that
would
take
a
long
period
of
time,
some,
say,
26
years
if
it's
--
if
the
dividends
are
in
such
number
or
if
you
sell
it
in
a
certain
amount,
it'll
take
20
years.
our
plan,
the
plan
we
proposed
in
the
district
court
called
for
10-year
period
for
the
divestiture,
with
a
right
to
approach
the
court
if
more
time
was
necessary.
the
period
of
10
years
although
it
was
thought
appropriate
at
the
time
in
the
law,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
now,
is
not
the
essence
of
our
--
of
our
plan.
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
think
that
if
you
--
if
the
effects
are
so
bad
that
you
need
more
time
to
separate
this
thing,
it's
much
better
thing
to
give
more
time
for
the
separation.
but
to
get
it
started
on
its
way
rather
than
to
have
a
continuation
of
this
relationship
into
the
indefinite
future
and
that
is
what
their
plan
suggests.
so
that
if
it
is
only
a
question
of
whether
it
should
be
10
or
20
years,
i
think
this
--
this
is
the
kind
of
a
thing
that
can
be
worked
out
with
the
court,
with
the
district
court.
i
think
it's
just
exactly
the
kind
of
thing
where
a
district
court's
discretion
is
--
is
important
and
--
and
where
they
can
--
where
they
can
readily
--
really
appraise
the
evidence.
now,
just
one
--
just
one
more
point
on
this
and
that
is
with
respect
to
the
impact
of
the
--
of
the
tax,
income
tax
on
the
--
on
the
stockholders.
i
want
to
point
out
that
if
we're
thinking
of
little
stockholders,
we're
going
to
be
embarrassed
to
pay
their
taxes.
that
the
evidence
which
was
introduced
by
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
that
for
holders
of
stock
from
1
to
100
shares
of
du
pont,
and
100
shares
of
du
pont
is
--
is
a
sizeable
investment
itself
for
over
$200
of
share,
but
the
holders
are
from
1
to
100
shares,
the
average
increase
in
income
tax
will
be
$50
a
year.
now,
actually
just
taking
by
a
number
of
stockholders
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
no,
this
is
--
this
is
from
an
analysis
which
the
appellees
made
of
their
income
from
all
sources.
they'd
sent
out
--
mr.
john
f.
davis
--
questionnaires
so
that
they
assume
they
would
be
in
an
income
bracket
of
16,000
to
20,000
from
the
ounces
that
they
got.
mr.
john
f.
davis
that's
right.
a
sampling
of
actual
fact,
they
found
that
--
that
in
this
group,
they
get
$16,000
to
$18,000
income
and
that
the
increase
in
the
--
in
their
income
and
the
tax
would
be
$50.
now,
actually,
if
you're
going
to
look
at
numbers
and
i
don't
propose
that
numbers
are
the
only
things
that
are
important,
but
there
are
--
of
the
--
of
the
holders
of
the
--
total
of
holders
of
the
du
pont
stock,
there
are
201,000
who
hold
1
to
100
shares,
they're
--
which
is,
what,
about
87%
or
something
like
that.
87%
of
the
number
of
stockholders
so
that
number
wise,
we
don't
--
we
don't
have
to
be
worried
about
the
little
stockholder
who's
going
to
have
to
sell.
i
mean,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
the
impact
on
him
--
even
the
impact
on
the
--
on
the
steepest
kind
of
divestiture
would
be
about
$50
a
year
if
it's
done
over
a
10-year
period.
the
impact
on
the
very
large
stockholders
will
be
very
large.
their
income
tax
will
be
--
will
be
up
in
the
89%
bracket.
there
is
a
list
of
this
income
--
of
these
stockholders
in
--
in
the
record.
and
if
you
run
through
that
list,
you
will
find
that
these
are
the
stockholders
who
have
been
associated
with
the
du
pont
enterprise
or
their
families
have
been,
from
the
very
beginning.
so
that
these
are
the
people
who
in
effect
have
profited
by
this
relationship
in
the
past
and
if
anyone
is
--
is
to
stand
the
loss
in
connection
with
the
divestiture,
these
are
the
people
who
can
best
afford
to
stand
that
loss.
