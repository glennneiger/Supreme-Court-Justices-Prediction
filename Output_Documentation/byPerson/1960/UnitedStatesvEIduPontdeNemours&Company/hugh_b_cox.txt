mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
begin
by
addressing
myself
to
the
question
whether
the
judgment
which
the
district
court
entered
in
this
case
after
a
flow
hearing
and
in
the
exercise
of
its
equitable
discretion
is
an
effective
judgment.
we
submit
it
is
effective
because
it
complies
with
a
mandate
of
this
court.
it
removes
the
--
eliminates
the
effects
of
this
stock
acquisition
that
are
offensive
to
the
statute.
now,
i
am
aware
that
logically,
perhaps
i
should
begin
this
argument
with
--
by
considering
the
question
whether
it's
divestiture
of
the
complete
legal
title
is
mandatory
as
a
matter
of
law
in
every
section
7
case.
i
do
propose
to
deal
with
that
question
but
with
the
court's
permission,
i
--
i
should
prefer
to
have
that
--
to
defer
that
question
until
i
can
put
the
question
of
this
judgement,
what
it
is
and
what
it
does,
the
question
of
its
effectiveness,
before
the
court,
because
i
think
that
the
two
things
are
so
related
that
perhaps
the
second
question
might
better
be
deferred
until
i
have
explained
our
position
on
the
first,
realizing
that,
of
course,
if
it's
mandatory,
as
a
matter
law,
that
there'd
be
complete
divestiture
of
the
legal
title.
that's
the
end
of
the
case
because
the
judge
below
didn't
order
complete
divestiture
of
the
legal
matter.
now,
i
should
like
to
supplement
very
briefly
in
few
respects
the
description
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
gave
of
the
judgement.
as
he
said,
the
judgment,
in
the
first
instance,
divested
du
pont
of
any
right
to
vote
63
million
shares
of
general
motors
which
it
owns.
it
can't
vote
it.
it
can't
influence
anybody
else
in
the
way
that
he
shall
vote
it.
the
judgment,
as
counsel
said,
passes
those
votes
on
to
the
du
pont
stockholders
except
that
no
votes
can
be
exercise
by
the
officers
and
directors
of
du
pont
or
by
christiana
or
by
their
officers
and
directors.
the
judgment
does
more
than
really
simply
abolish
interlocking
directors.
what
the
judgment
does
is
it
provided
a
period
of
grace
of
90
days
in
which
anybody
who
was
on
both
boards
had
to
resign.
everyone
who
was
on
both
boards
resigned
from
one
of
the
others
so
that
there
are
no
interlocking
directors.
that
is
the
usual
interlocking
director
provision.
but
this
judgement
goes
beyond
them
because
it
provides
that
if,
after
that
90-day
period,
a
man
has
ever
on
the
board
or
an
officer
of
du
pont
company,
he
cannot,
ever
again,
by
resigning
from
the
du
pont
company,
qualify
himself
to
be
an
officer
or
a
director
of
general
motors.
and
the
same
thing
works
the
other
way.
so
that
after
the
90-day
period,
as
far
as
the
officers
and
directors
are
concern,
there
is
a
clean
and
absolute
and
permanent
rate,
there
could
no
be
shifting
back
and
forth
by
resignations.
that's
the
end
of
that
relationship.
as
far
as
the
injunctive
provisions
of
the
judgment
are
concerned,
i
think
it's
worthwhile
to
say
that
those
provisions
enjoining
all
contracts
require
when
it
comes
to
the
relation
of
all
contracts
which
--
under
which
general
motors
might
buy
any
percentage
no
matter
how
small
of
its
requirements
of
any
commodity
from
du
pont.
for
three
years,
no
contracts
of
that
kind
at
all
can
be
made.
after
three
years,
a
contract
of
that
kind
can
be
made
if
it's
limited
to
one
year
or
to
one
model
car
year.
that's
what
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
contract
that
requires
or
provides
for
the
purchase
by
general
motors
at
any
percentage
of
its
requirements
of
commodity.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
any
percentage
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
of
its
total
requirements.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
1%,
2%,
3%,
4%,
any
percent.
the
injunctive
provisions
forbid
any
exclusive
granting
of
patent
rights
by
one
company
to
the
other.
they
forbid
general
motors
from
giving
du
pont
any
--
exclusive
right
to
exploit
or
manufacture
or
develop
any
chemical
discovery
that's
made
by
general
motors.
they
forbid
general
motors
to
deal
on
any
basis
with
du
pont
to
that
all
for
first
du
pont.
and
then
there
is
another
provision
in
which
i
--
we
think
it
was
improperly
included
in
the
judgement
but
we
haven't
appealed
which
specifically
enjoins
du
pont
from
giving
any
favors
to
general
motors,
in
its
dealings
with
general
motors.
now,
i
should
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
those
provisions
of
the
judgement
which
operate
directly
upon
the
stock,
not
these
injunctive
provisions
that
i
have
been
speaking
of
but
the
stock
provisions.
it
is
our
position
that
--
that
the
--
what
those
provisions
do
is
to
deprive
du
pont
of
every
right
and
privilege
and
power
that
is
inherit
in
stock
ownership
that
might
be
used
or
that
by
--
might,
by
its
mere
existence,
had
any
capacity
to
control
or
to
influence
general
motors.
i
should
have
suppose
until
this
issue
arose
today
that
everyone
would
agree
that
the
capacity
of
the
stockholder,
capacity
of
the
stockholder
influence
or
control
corporate
action
depends
ultimately
upon
his
capacity
to
exercise,
in
one
way
or
another,
voting
rights.
that
is
what
appellant
heretofore
has
always
argued
in
this
case.
when
the
case
was
here
before,
appellant
argued
that
du
pont
could
control
or
influence
general
motors
because
du
pont
voted
23%
of
the
stock
of
the
stockholders'
meeting.
it's
frequently
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
stock
present.
that
that
right
to
vote
gave
du
pont
representation
on
the
board
of
directors
of
general
motors.
that
it
gave
it
representation
on
the
committees
of
the
board.
and
indeed
that
it
give
it
representation
in
the
management
of
general
motors.
those
were
the
arguments
that
were
made
by
appellant,
an
argument
which
it
prevailed.
now,
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
each
one
of
those
things
is
going
into
this
judgement.
du
pont
can't
vote.
it
can't
have
anybody
on
the
board.
it
can't
have
anyone
who
is
an
officer
or
a
director.
it
can't
serve
on
the
committees
of
the
board.
it
can't
influence
through
that
stock
ownership
the
conduct
of
general
motors
in
any
way.
i
should
like
to
--
now,
i
point
out
that
when
the
--
what
is
left
here,
so
far
as
the
du
pont
company
is
concerned,
is
a
legal
title.
and
i
think
it's
useful
for
us
to
--
to
consider
what
that
title
means
in
terms
of
control
or
influence
of
general
motors.
title
itself,
of
course,
is
an
abstraction
that
means
a
bundle
of
rights.
now,
what
are
the
rights
and
privileges
that
are
elected?
well,
in
the
first
place
du
pont,
under
this
judgement,
can
sell
its
stock
provided
it
gets
the
approval
of
the
court
and
provided
appellant
doesn't
object.
but
that's
not
a
right
that
can
be
used
to
influence
or
control
general
motors.
in
the
second
place,
if
there
is
a
liquidation
or
dissolution
of
general
motors,
du
pont,
by
virtue
of
this
legal
title,
could
share
pro
rata
in
the
assets.
well,
i
think
everyone
will
agree
that's
of
no
practical
consequence.
now,
the
third
thing
is
that
du
pont
continues
to
receive
dividends
on
the
stock.
two
points
i
should
like
to
make
about
those
dividends.
in
the
first
place,
so
far
as
this
is
important
to
consider
whether
du
pont
can
control
or
influence
general
motors,
i
suggest
that
the
fact
that
general
motors
pays
du
pont
dividends
in
exactly
the
same
way,
in
the
same
amount
that
it
pays
every
other
stockholder
of
general
motors,
certainly
doesn't
give
du
pont
any
capacity
to
control
or
to
influence
general
motors.
the
other
comment
i
should
like
to
make
is,
that
--
and
this
i
--
i
feel
and
perhaps
it's
not
apparent
known
to
the
court.
it
has
been
that
consistent
practice
of
du
pont
for
years
to
pass
the
amount
of
those
dividends
on
to
its
own
shareholders
less
the
amount
of
the
intercorporate
dividend
tax.
du
pont
is
merely
a
conduit
to
those
dividends.
that
practical
situation
isn't
any
different
than
it
would
be,
if,
really,
general
motors,
to
some
arrangement,
even
under
an
order
of
the
court,
paid
the
dividends
directly
to
the
shareholders
of
du
pont.
now,
counsel
for
the
appellant
has
referred
to
fact
that
the
amount
of
dividends
that
are
paid
to
du
pont
and
that
are
passed
on
by
du
pont
to
its
shareholders
is
very
substantial,
and
that
is
true.
but
i
ask
the
court,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
violation
of
law
that
was
found
in
this
case?
what
relationship
is
there
between
those
payments
and
the
probability
that
there
may
be
some
restraints
or
monopolization
of
trade?
the
mere
receipt
of
that
money,
i
think,
from
the
face
of
it,
has
no
relationship.
it
creates
no
possibility
or
threat.
restraint
particularly
in
view
of
the
facts
to
dividends
had
been
direct
and
passed
on
to
shareholders.
there
is
no
suggestion
of
the
fact
to
the
presented
testimony
in
the
court
below
that
that's
what
du
pont
intended
to
do.
now,
oddly
enough,
the
plaintiff,
although
it
talks
the
appellant
or
it
talks
about
the
dividends
here,
didn't
ask
for
any
relief
as
to
the
dividends
in
the
court
below.
so
that
--
that
is
what
the
judgement
leaves
in
the
du
pont
company
and
most
--
it's
a
sterile
kind
of
investment
which
is
deprived
of
any
capacity
or
power,
we
submit,
to
influence
or
to
control
general
motors.
now,
what
--
what
does
the
appellant
say
in
criticism
of
this
judgement.
well,
it
first
makes
the
point
that
was
made
this
afternoon
that
the
stockholders
of
du
pont
who
are
entitled
to
exercise
these
voting
rights
on
15%
of
the
stock
may
act
in
the
concerts
or
they
may
follow
some
common
program
or
perhaps
in
management
of
general
motors
will
fear
that
they
will
do
so
and
will
act
accordingly.
now,
i
--
the
appellant
--
we
press
the
appellant
on
this
point
in
order
to
be
more
precise
about
this
in
our
brief
and
in
its
reply
brief
at
page
9,
the
comment
it
made
was
this,
that
even
if
the
shareholders
didn't
act
in
concert
and
didn't
go
to
the
stockholders'
meeting
with
any
prearranged
plan,
they
could
ask
questions
which
would
be
very
troublesome
and
difficult.
i
really
think
we
are
entitled
to
somewhat
more
precise
argument
than
that.
does
appellant
mean
that
by
this
independent
questions
at
the
stockholders'
meeting,
the
management
of
general
motors
is
going
to
be
intimated
or
coerced
into
buying
paint
from
du
pont
even
it
doesn't
want
to
buy
or
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
stockholders
unorganized
their
200,000
of
--
are
going
to
conduct
a
proxy
campaign
for
the
opening
of
a
valid
purpose
of
removing
the
management
of
general
motors
because
it
won't
buy
paint
from
du
pont?
i
think
--
i
submit
to
the
court,
when
you
state
these
arguments
with
any
degree
of
precision
and
look
at
them
in
terms
of
practicalities,
they
fall
of
their
own
weight.
now,
there
is
another
argument
or
--
or
group
of
arguments
which
--
before
i
leave
that
subject
let
me
say
this.
of
course,
if
there
is
any
danger,
we
think
there
isn't,
but
if
there
is
any
danger
in
this
exercise
of
voting
rights
by
the
stockholders
of
the
du
pont
company,
it
does
not
require
this
divestiture
of
the
legal
title
to
deal
with
it.
i
think
that
perhaps
appellant's
counsel
this
afternoon,
in
effect,
conceded
that.
you
could
adopt
measures
that
would
prevent
the
stock
from
being
voted
at
all.
or
you
could,
as
an
alternative,
you
could
provide
that
it
should
be
voted
as
a
mechanical
administrative
matter
in
exactly
the
same
percentages
that
the
other
76%
of
the
stock
is
voted.
and
if
that
should
be
done,
we
don't
think
it's
necessary,
we
are
not
advocating
it.
we
think
it's
preferable
to
the
divestiture
of
the
legal
title
because
it
will
not
have
the
consequences
to
the
stockholders
of
the
two
companies
that
divestiture
would.
but
if
that
should
be
done,
it
would
remove
completely
any
possibility
that
the
exercise
of
voting
rights
by
200,000
diverse
and
independent
shareholders
could
have
any
effect
upon
the
practices
of
general
motors.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
suggestion,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
this,
there
are
two
suggestions.
one,
is
you
sterilize.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
other
suggestion
is
that
you
provide
that
that
stock
shall
be
voted
under
the
direction
of
the
court
at
the
stockholders'
meeting
in
exactly
the
same
percentages
that
the
balance
of
the
general
motors
stock
is
voted,
that
is,
if
you
have
76%
of
the
stock
of
general
motors
held
by
people
who
have
no
connection
with
this
case.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
if
a
proposition
comes
before
the
stockholders'
meeting
and
15%
of
the
stock
voters'
votes
for
and
the
rest
of
it
votes
against,
then
you
would
take
these
shares
of
du
pont
and
split
them
the
same
way
and
vote
them
the
same
way.
it
would
make
myself
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
it
is
--
it
is
the
same
thing.
i
think
that
if
there
are
some
situations
where
possibly
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
--
need
a
certain
number
of
votes
were
that
might
solve
the
problem.
no,
i
don't
think
that's
a
very
likely
situation.
you
--
you're
aware,
mr.
justice
whittaker,
sometimes,
you
need
60%
or
70%
of
the
votes
to
do
certain
things
but
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
the
--
the
--
that
is
because
the
--
the
judgement
passes
through
the
votes
on
an
amount
of
the
63
million
shares
of
du
pont
that
is
equal
to
about
15%
of
the
outstanding
stock
of
general
motors.
the
balance
of
it
is
sterilized
under
the
provisions
that
have
been
described
here
this
afternoon.
now,
i
would
--
before
i
dealt
with
this
matter
of
the
--
of
the
last
comment
i
made
on
the
voting
rights,
i
was
about
to
deal
with
the
other
argument
which
is
the
only
other
argument
which
appellant's
counsel
has
made
this
afternoon
in
attacking
the
effectiveness
of
this
judgment
in
effect.
and
i
--
i
must
concede
to
the
court
that
it
is
a
difficult
argument
for
me
to
get
my
hands
on
because
it
is
a
vague
argument
and
it
seems
to
me
that
tend
to
pretend
when
i
lay
hands
on
it
in
one
shape
and
changes
into
another
shape.
but
as
i
understand
the
argument,
and
i
--
i
perhaps
run
the
dangers
of
stating
it
more
precisely
than
--
than
the
counsel
for
appellant
had,
it
is
an
argument
that
under
this
judgement,
du
pont
will
retain
a
large
financial
interest
in
general
motors.
and
that
is
true
in
a
limited
sense
that
i've
spoke
of
a
little
while
ago.
it
will
hold
a
legal
tittle
to
this
stock.
appellant
argues
that
because
of
this
financial
interest,
there
will
be
some
tendency,
possibility
or
probability
that
general
motors
will
favor
du
pont
in
their
commercial
dealings.
for
example,
that
it
will
continue
to
buy
paint
from
du
pont
instead
of
buying
it
from
competitive
sources.
now,
here,
again,
we
press
appellant
in
our
brief
to
be
specific
and
in
response,
appellant
made
two
arguments.
one
of
which
has
been
made
here
this
afternoon.
that
is
the
argument
that
if
in
the
future,
chevrolet,
for
example,
should
decide
to
stop
buying
paint
from
du
pont.
and
again,
buying
paint
from
general
motors,
these
200,000
shareholders
of
the
du
pont
company
or
all
the
shareholders
of
du
pont
company
would
stop
buying
chevrolet
cars
because
they
were
annoyed
by
the
change
of
the
paint's
suppliers.
now,
i'm
not
sure
how
much
i
should
say
about
that
argument.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
to
assume
or
rather
extraordinary
situation
or
make
extraordinary
assumptions
about
the
buying
habits
of
the
american
public.
as
i
understand
the
argument,
it
--
it
posits
a
situation
like
this.
chevrolet
salesman
goes
around
to
a
prospective
customer
and
says,
"i
would
like
to
sell
you
a
chevrolet."
and
the
customer
says,
"alright,
now,
before
i
ask
you
anything
else
about
this
car
or
before
you
tell
me
anything
about
it,
i
want
to
know
who
makes
the
paint
on
the
car
because
i'm
the
shareholder
of
the
du
pont
company
and
i'm
interested
in
that."
now,
i
don't
know
what
the
salesman
would
say.
i
think
in
reality,
he
would
probably
say,
"well,
look,
brother,
i
don't
know
who
made
the
paint
but
i
could
tell
you
one
thing,
it's
a
very
good
paint."
but
let's
assume
that
he
knows
everything
about
the
paint
that
a
plant
superintendent
of
the
chevrolet
company
knows.
and
then
he
would
say,
"well,
it
is
true,
they
use
to
buy
that
paint
from
du
pont."
but
now,
that's
a
little
different.
the
--
the
topcoat
on
this
car
is
made
by
rinshed-mason
and
the
undercoat
is
made
by
rin
--
rinshed-mason.
i
think
they
still
get
the
primer
which
goes
underneath
both
of
them
from
du
pont.
and
as
far
as
that
black
on
the
engine
is
concerned,
that
comes
from
the
acme
paint
&
varnish
company."
and
then
the
customer
says,
"alright,
that's
enough
for
me.
i
don't
care
what
the
car
cost,
i
don't
care
what
it
looks
like,
i
don't
care
how
many
miles
you
get
the
gallon
of
gas
or
what
kind
of
an
engine
it
has,
i'm
finish.
i'm
going
to
find
a
car
that
has
nothing
but
du
pont
paint
on
it."
i
think
i
should
leave
that
argument.
the
other
argument
that
i
make,
which
was
again
advanced,
i
think,
this
afternoon,
is
an
argument
which
i
think
--
so
that
i
shall
not
run
any
risk
of
--
of
misstating
it,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
shall
read
on
page
10
of
their
reply
brief.
this
is
a
separate
argument
on
this
financial
interest
point.
appellant
says,
"and
it
is
wholly
possible
for
du
pont
without
overt
action
to
exert
considerable
pressure
through
its
other
business
and
financial
connections."
i
take
it
that
was
the
same
argument
that
was
being
made
this
afternoon
when
appellant's
counsel
referred
to
morgan
stanley.
now,
there
are
two
comments.
i
think
they
are
very
important
about
that
argument.
the
motive
for
du
pont
to
do
anything
of
that
kind
is,
of
course,
a
desire
to
increase
the
volume
of
what
it
sells
to
general
motors.
now,
that
motive
will
remain
even
if
you
have
complete
divestiture
of
the
legal
title.
so
that
by
divesting
yourself
of
the
legal
--
du
pont
of
the
legal
title,
it
does
not
remove
the
motive.
the
other
comment
i
should
like
to
make
is,
that
these
connections,
as
to
which
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record,
but
these
connections
would
exist
whether
you
divest
it
to
legal
title
or
not.
precisely
the
same
situation
would
exist.
you
would
have
the
motive,
what
the
mystery
story
writers
call
"the
opportunity".
and
you
can't
change
that
by
divesting
the
legal
title.
so
on
that
point,
appellant's
proposals
are
no
wit
nor
sufficient
than
ours.
that
comment,
i
think,
applies
also
to
appellant's
argument
that
simply
because
of
buying
habits
or
custom
or
old
acquaintance,
the
purchasing
agents
will
keep
on
dealing
with
people
from
du
pont.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not.
i
doubt
whether
it
have
a
"quantship"
quite
that
strong
in
the
business
where
a
cost
is
so
important.
but
assume
it
is.
you
can't
change
that
by
divesting
the
legal
title.
those
are
--
are
parallels
or
imaginary
dangerous
which
are
not
touched
by
appellant's
proposal.
in
our
judgment,
they
do
not
justify
appellant's
demand
for
complete
divestiture
of
the
legal
type.
appellant
has
made
another
argument
in
its
brief,
which
it
has
not
made
this
afternoon
here,
and
for
that
reason
i'm
not
--
i'm
trying
not
to
say
very
much
about
it,
but
i
think
i
should
mention
it,
and
that
is
that
even
if
you
assume
that
this
judgement
is
completely
affected
to
prevent
general
motors
from
favoring
du
pont,
it
isn't
effective
to
prevent
du
pont
from
favoring
general
motors.
that
is
an
argument
which
turns
this
case
upside
down.
the
appellant
prevailed
in
this
court
before
on
the
argument
that
the
vice
in
this
situation
was
that
by
reason
of
the
stock
ownership,
du
pont
was
in
a
position
where
it
could
preempt
the
market
represented
by
general
motors'
purchasers
to
its
own
advantage
and
to
the
detriment
of
its
competitors.
this
other
argument,
as
i
say,
is
an
argument
that
reversed
its
answer.
it
says
that
the
danger
is
not
bad
at
all.
the
danger
is
that
du
pont,
by
giving
favors
to
general
motors,
will
enable
general
motors
to
gain
some
advantages
or
monopolistic
position
in
the
markets
in
which
general
motors
operates.
i
should
like
to
make
these
comments
about
that
argument.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
no
adjudication
in
this
case
by
this
court
or
by
the
district
court
which
would
make
it
permissible
in
our
view
for
the
court
to
grant
divestiture
on
any
such
basis
as
that.
certainly
the
fear
that
general
--
du
pont
would
give
general
motors
some
advantages,
which
would
now
allow
general
motors
to
monopolize
some
market,
was
not
a
probability
adjudicated
by
this
court
in
its
--
on
the
merits.
the
second,
there
are
no
findings,
there
are
no
evidence.
such
evidence,
as
there
is,
is
directly
contrary
to
this
argument.
there
is
--
there
are
evidences
--
it's
for
the
meager
evidence
because
this
issue
was
never
tried.
there
are
three
instances
in
the
record
where
du
pont
developed
an
extraordinary
and
remarkable
product
which
it
given
the
general
motors
on
exclusive
basis
with
no
doubt
has
given
an
--
an
advantage.
that
didn't
happen
in
those
cases.
duco
is
the
most
striking
one
because
there,
general
motors
asked
for
the
exclusive
right
to
use
it
and
was
refused.
the
fact
is
that
on
--
in
economic
terms,
taking
into
account
the
amount
of
sales
of
--
to
general
motors
in
relation
to
du
pont's
total
sales,
it
would
not,
i
think,
ever
be
du
pont's
advantage
to
do
anything
of
that
kind.
but
beyond
that,
i
should
like
to
leave
the
court
with
this
contention
this
afternoon,
that
the
--
there
is
no
authority
precedent
which
would
entitle
appellant
to
obtain
relief,
the
radical
relief
of
divestiture.
on
a
legal
theory
that
has
never
been
adjudicated
as
to
which
there
are
no
conclusions
or
findings
which
such
evidence
as
there
is,
is
contrary
to
the
appellant's
contention.
in
short,
it
is
a
theory
in
which
the
court
to
accept
would
have
to
suppress
what
facts
there
are
and
invent
other
facts
to
supply
the
basis
of
the
holding.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
this
morning,
i
should
like
to
discuss
the
appellant's
legal
argument
that
section
--
in
section
7
cases,
divestiture
is
a
mandatory
remedy
as
a
matter
of
law.
before
i
do
so,
however,
there
are
two
very
brief
comments
that
i
should
like
to
make
in
concluding
the
argument
that
i
made
yesterday
about
the
effectiveness
of
the
judgment.
i
had
been
discussing
when
the
court
wrote
as
my
proposition
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
financial
interest
in
the
attenuated
form
in
which
it
continues
to
exist
in
du
pont
under
this
judgment,
did
not
carry
with
it
any
potential
or
capability
or
create
any
probability
of
a
restraint
trade.
now,
of
course,
i
can
conceive
of
circumstances
in
which
a
mortgagor
or
a
large
creditor,
even
a
general
creditor
of
a
corporation,
might,
in
certain
conditions,
have
some
capacity
to
influence
or
control
a
conduct
of
that
corporation.
the
point
i
was
making
yesterday
and
make
now
is,
that
when
that
happens,
it
is
not
because
of
the
existence
of
the
financial
interest
itself,
but
because
of
the
potential
rights
or
privileges
or
powers
that
in
herein
or
go
with
financial
interest.
under
this
judgment,
du
pont
has
none
of
the
rights
of
a
mortgagor
or
of
a
creditor.
it
doesn't
even
have
the
rights
of
a
preferred
stockholder.
and
before
i
leave
this
subject,
i
should
like
to
remind
the
court
that
section
7
itself
does
not
ream
on
financial
interest
per
se.
the
section
does
not
prohibit
the
acquisition
of
stocks
or
bonds
or
other
evidences
of
indebtedness.
it
does
not
indeed
prohibit
the
acquisitions
of
stock
done
purely
for
investment
purposes
and
if
not
used
by
voting
or
otherwise,
to
achieve
a
restraint
of
trade.
this
is
not
a
legal
argument.
i
am
now
making
respect
to
that
aspect
of
the
statute.
i
am
merely
suggesting
to
the
court
that
when
congress
formed
its
legislative
judgment
as
to
the
kinds
of
relationships
it
was
going
to
cover
in
section
7,
apparently,
it
did
not
believe
that
a
mere
financial
interest
accompanied
--
unaccompanied
by
any
right
to
vote
was
the
kind
of
interest
that
created
the
economic
probabilities
that
the
section
was
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
yes.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that
--
and
i
think
yesterday,
what
i
said
about
that,
i
would
say
again
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
the
extent
that
that
momentum
and
i
think
in
the
terms
of
the
appellant's
argument,
i
can
regard
it
this
way
that
the
terms
--
that
the
extent
of
that
momentum
exists,
it
does
not
exist
because
of
the
stock
relationship
which
should
be
left
under
--
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
that,
i
suppose,
is
a
contention.
but
my
answer
to
that
is
that
their
proposal
for
a
complete
divestiture
does
not
take
away
that
extra
push.
the
other
brief
comment
i
should
like
to
make
is
an
address
to
an
argument
which
appellant
makes,
which
seems
to
me,
in
large
part,
semantic,
but
i
think
it
deserves
a
word
of
comment.
in
their
briefs
and
yesterday,
the
theme
recurs
that
the
trouble
with
this
judgment
is
that
it
does
not
suppress
the
evil
or
the
disease
itself.
it
only
suppresses
the
effects
or
the
symptoms.
i
think
that
argument
is
an
argument
in
which
(inaudible)
tries
to
do
the
work
of
analysis,
because
what
appellant
describes
as
the
symptoms
or
the
effects,
in
my
judgment,
is
the
evil
or
the
illegality
itself.
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
acquisition
of
stock
per
se.
it
prohibits
the
acquisition
of
stock
when
certain
economic
consequences
or
the
probability
of
those
consequences
follows.
with
the
court's
permission
with
some
diffidence,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
this
case
because
i
think
that
mandate
properly
construed
the
statute.
the
mandate
directed
the
district
court
to
enter
a
judgment
which
would
eliminate
the
consequences
of
the
stock
acquisition
which
were
offensive
to
the
statute.
that
is
what
the
district
court
did.
and
when
it
eliminated
those
--
the
probability
of
those
consequences,
which
is
what
this
judgment
did,
it
eliminated
the
disease
and
the
illegality
and
the
evil
as
well
as
the
symptoms
and
the
effects.
now,
that
brings
me
to
appellant's
legal
argument
that
divestiture
is
a
mandatory
remedy
in
all
section
7
cases.
as
counsel
for
appellant
quite
candidally
stated
yesterday,
this
is
an
argument
of
why
the
application
--
it
means
that
in
every
section
7
case,
there
must
be
complete
divestiture
of
the
legal
title
even
though
admittedly,
that
may
not
be
necessary
to
effective
relief.
and
even
though
admittedly,
it
may
inflict
injurious
consequences
on
persons
who
were
innocent
in
any
real
sense,
of
any
wrongdoing.
that
is
as
--
an
application.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
facts
to
this
case
as
i
understand
it.
it
goes
across
the
board
in
every
case,
no
matter
what
the
facts
are.
now,
appellant
also
frankly
conceded
that
it
gets
little
comfort
from
the
words
of
section
15,
which
is
the
source
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
to
grant
a
jurisdiction
is
general,
the
section
does
not
specify
any
particular
remedy
or
remedies.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
at
the
very
outset,
appellant's
argument
runs
into
direct
conflict
with
the
principle
--
with
the
principle
this
court
has
laid
down.
that
limitations
and
restrictions
on
the
equity
jurisdiction,
the
historic
equity
powers
of
the
federal
courts,
are
not
to
be
imposed
by
implication
or
inference
or
innuendo,
but
nothing
short
of
a
direct
and
explicit
statutory
command
will
do.
we
have
cited
at
page
120
of
our
brief,
cases
including
hecht
against
bowles
and
stewart
against
warner
which
announced
and
applied
that
principle.
i
think
the
appellant's
difficulties
are
enhanced
and
not
assisted
when
you
consider
the
relationship
between
section
15
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
4
of
the
sherman
act.
the
two
sections
are
stated
in
exactly
the
same
words.
and
the
legislative
history
of
section
15,
and
there
is
no
dispute
between
us
on
this
point,
shows
that
when
congress
passed
section
15,
it
said,
is
intended
to
give
the
federal
courts
the
same
power,
same
range
of
equitable
discretion
under
section
15
(a)
and
under
section
4.
now,
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
argument,
it
says
that
under
section
4
in
sherman
act
cases,
divestiture
is
mandatory
in
certain
kinds
of
situation,
to
wit,
where
the
heart
of
the
illegality
is
the
acquisition
of
stock.
there
is
nothing
in
the
words
of
section
4
which
says
that
and
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
4
or
section
15
which
says
that.
but
appellant
says
that
as
a
matter
of
judicial
interpretation
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act,
that
principle
had
been
recognized
and
that
congress
must
have
been
aware
of
that
and
therefore,
when
congress
passed
section
15,
it
intended,
although
it
did
not
say
so
that
divestiture
should
be
a
mandatory
remedy
in
certain
class
of
cases.
i
suggest
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
the
terminal
company
of
st.
louis
is
fatal
to
that
argument.
that
case
was
decided
in
1912,
two
years
before
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act.
the
heart
of
the
illegality
in
that
case
was
the
acquisition
of
stock.
a
terminal
company
had
acquired
the
stock
of
two
competing
companies
that
run
terminal
facilities
and
by
that
means,
had
obtained
a
stranglehold
over
all
the
terminal
facilities
in
st.
louis.
the
government
in
that
case,
asked
for
divestiture
or
dis
--
dissolution.
this
court
decided
that
an
alternative
form
of
relief
would
be
effective
and
more
appropriate.
now,
there
is
one
significant
thing
i
should
like
to
add
about
that
case.
it
was
decided
by
a
court
of
seven
justices.
every
one
of
those
seven
justices
had
sat
and
concurred
in
the
opinions
in
the
tobacco
and
the
standard
oil
case
which
had
been
divided
--
decided
about
two
years
or
a
year
before.
those
are
two
other
cases
which
appellant
says,
before
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act,
laid
down
this
rule
that
divestiture
was
mandatory
whenever
there
was
an
unlawful
acquisition
of
stock.
yet,
in
refusing
to
order
divestiture
in
the
terminal
case,
this
--
not
one
of
the
seven
justices
appeared
to
recognize
that
rule.
indeed,
in
the
very
passage
of
the
case
or
the
opinion
in
which
the
court
discusses
relief,
the
court
cited
the
standard
oil
case
without
any
recognition
explicit
or
--
or
implicit,
that
that
case
laid
down
any
rule
and
divestiture
was
mandatory
in
any
particular
kind
of
case.
now,
the
appellant
--
i
will
say
this.
we
have
in
our
brief
and
in
the
interest
of
conserving
time
for
the
counsel
for
the
other
--
appellees
here,
i
should
like
to
rest
on
the
brief
on
this
point.
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
cases
and
instances
of
administrative
practice
since
the
passage
of
the
clayton
act
which
we
think
established
that
no
court
has
ever
held
that
divestiture
is
a
mandatory
remedy
as
a
matter
of
law,
under
either
the
sherman
act
or
the
clayton
act,
without
--
in
any
particular
kind
of
case.
cases
that
hold
that
it's
an
appropriate
remedy
and
it
may
be
granted
from
cases
hold
in
certain
circumstances.
it's
the
best
remedy,
those
points
aren't
in
dispute.
but
we
submit
that
law
shall
--
that
there
is
no
rule,
what
it
has
meant
or
in
a
sense
of
--
that
there
is
a
rule
that
limits
the
equitable
discretion
of
the
court.
the
appellant
--
before
i
leave
that
point,
i
--
with
diffidence
again,
i
should
like
to
refer
the
fact
that
in
its
prior
opinion
in
this
case,
this
court
said
that
the
district
courts
are
closed
with
large
discretion
to
mold
their
judgments
to
the
exigency
of
a
particular
case.
i
don't
want
to
argue
that
point.
i
just
suggest
that
i
find
it
difficult
at
least
to
reconcile
appellant's
argument
with
that
statement.
appellant
also
relies
on
section
11
of
the
clayton
act.
that
is
a
section
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
district
courts
or
with
their
jurisdiction.
it
is
a
section
that
is
confined
entirely
to
the
procedures
to
be
followed
by
administrative
agencies.
we
have
discussed
that
section
in
our
brief
and
again,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
prefer
rest
on
that
discussion
in
the
brief.
we
make
essentially
two
points
there.
first
that
we
think,
the
plaintiff
or
the
appellant
has
misconstrued
section
11.
but
even
in
administrative
proceedings,
divestiture
is
not
always
a
mandatory
remedy
and
we
point
out
the
two
agencies
who
have
important
responsibilities
under
that
--
under
section
11,
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
icc
have
in
the
past,
in
our
judgment,
not
construed
it
in
that
way.
we
say
in
second
place
that
even
if
you
assume
it
is
mandatory
in
those
proceedings
which
have
brought
before
administrative
agency,
it
does
not
follow
that
the
section
imposes
any
comparable
limitation
on
historic
equity
powers
of
the
district
courts.
and
we
have
cited
authorities
which
we
think
support
that
argument.
and
i
should
therefore,
like
to
leave
the
question
of
section
11
submitted
on
our
brief.
at
points
in
appellant's
argument,
it
seems
to
retreat
from
the
position
that
divestiture
is
always
mandatory
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
to
argue
rather
that
it
should
be
and
must
be
applied
in
this
case,
because
it
is
customary
or
usual.
now,
i
should
just
like
to
say
this
about
that
argument.
it
seems
to
me
that
an
argument
that
any
particular
remedy
must
be
applied
in
a
particular
case,
because
it
has
been
customary
or
usual,
is
an
argument
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
basic
notion
of
equity
jurisdiction.
equity
judgments
are
not
standardized.
one
of
the
justices
of
this
court
in
a
dissenting
opinion
said
that
an
equity
decree
is
not
like
a
standardized
product
or
the
packaged
goods
that
are
produced
in
this
machinery.
they
have
one
thing
in
common.
and
that
is
that
each
one
is
molded
to
fit
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
we
therefore
suggested
as
a
matter
of
law,
jurisdiction
of
the
discretion
of
a
federal
court
seeking
inequity
is
not
controlled
or
limited
by
any
rule
of
law
that
is
founded
in
custom
or
habit
or
practice.
the
situation
has
to
be
judged
and
the
remedy
applied
and
devised
from
the
light
of
facts
in
the
particular
case.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question
of
what
the
consequences
would
be
in
this
case
if
plaintiffs
demand
--
or
appellants
demand
for
divestiture
should
be
granted.
and
i
should
like
to
be
clear
that
i
have
put
that
question
in
the
proper
context
for
this
court.
the
district
court
did
not
act
on
the
assumption
that
it
should
grant
ineffective
relief
in
order
to
protect
the
stockholders
and
we
are
not
arguing
that.
the
district
court
recognized
that
its
primary
duty
was
to
formulate
a
judgment
complied
with
the
mandate
of
this
court
and
remove
the
probability
that
was
offensive
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
and
that
is
what
in
our
opinion,
the
district
court
did.
now,
the
district
court
did
say
that
in
choosing
between
effective
remedies,
it
thought,
it
was
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
the
effect
that
one
remedy
as
opposed
to
another,
might
add
upon
the
interest
of
the
stockholder.
there
are
substantially
more
than
a
million
beneficial
owners
of
stock
in
these
two
corporations.
and
--
include
men
and
women
and
all
walks
and
ranges
of
life,
variety
of
institutions,
investment
trust,
insurance
companies,
charities,
hospitals,
universities,
we
submit
that
it
was
a
proper
exercise
of
equity
jurisdiction
for
the
court
to
take
their
interest
into
account.
now,
as
i
understand
appellant's
argument,
it
does
not
seriously
deny
that
divestiture
will
inflict
some
inquiry
on
stockholders,
but
it
says
that
some
cases,
it's
irrelevant
or
in
other
cases,
it
is
not
--
and
this
is
appellant's
word,
undue
and
yesterday,
it
argued
that
it
would
only
be
immediate
or
short
ranged.
it
wouldn't
over
a
long
historical
view,
be
very
serious.
i
should
like
to
suggest
the
court
that
since
this
judgment
is
an
effective
judgment,
it
is
really
not
necessary
to
assess
or
try
to
appraise
the
exact
quantum,
the
injury
that
maybe
inflicted
by
divestiture.
if
the
judgment
is
effective
and
we
say
it
is,
then
any
injury
whether
it's
immediate
or
long
term
or
whether
it's
moderate
or
large,
seems
to
us,
unnecessary.
i
--
i
think,
i
should
make
it
clear
to
the
court
that
i
am
not
arguing
in
quite
the
mellow
dramatic
term
suggested
by
counsel
that
disaster
will
follow
if
divestiture
is
ordered.
we
are
suggesting
that
if
divestiture
is
ordered,
the
stockholders
of
these
companies
will
suffer
the
serious
injury.
and
i
--
i
suppose
it's
unnecessary,
but
i
--
i
should
like
to
show
the
court
that
i
am
not
engaged
in
projected
terrorize
to
frighten
this
court.
i
have
no
confidence
in
my
capacity
to
do
that
even
if
i
were
of
a
mind
to
do
it.
but,
we
were
before
--
we
are
before
a
court
of
equity
and
we
assume
that
it's
proper
for
us
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
what
the
consequences
of
one
form
of
relief
maybe
as
against
another.
and
that's
what
we
did
in
the
district
court
and
that's
what
we
are
doing
here.
now,
that
brings
me
to
how
this
divestiture
that
appellant
is
--
wants,
could
be
accomplished.
in
our
judgment,
there
are
only
two
ways
which
it
could
be
done.
one
would
be
to
sell
the
stock,
the
other
would
be
to
distribute
the
stock
as
dividends
to
shareholders
of
du
pont
company.
in
this
court
for
the
first
time,
appellant
has
suggested
that
perhaps
the
stock
could
be
divested
by
exchanges
and
i
hope
that
i
shall
have
time
to
explain
to
the
court
why
that
is
not
a
feasible
method
of
divestiture.
i
should
say
that
in
the
district
court
it
seems
to
me,
appellant
recognized
that
the
only
two
methods
of
divestiture
that
are
really
possible
were
sales
or
distributions
of
dividends.
it
brought
into
the
district
court
and
defended
their
specific
plan
that
provided
for
divestiture
by
sales
and
distribution.
it
appears
now,
it
will
abandon
that
plan
or
at
least,
not
to
the
insisting
upon
it.
but,
i
think
at
least
then
it
recognized
what
we
think
is
true
that
those
are
the
two
ways
that
will
have
to
be
employed.
now,
as
to
sale,
this
stock
has
a
present
market
value
of
65
million
shares,
of
about
two
and
a
half
billion
dollars.
the
forced
sale
of
that
stock
or
at
any
substantial
part
in
a
10-year
period
as
appellant
insist
in
gradable
amounts
each
year
during
that
period,
will
the
evidence
establishes,
have
a
substantially
depressing
effect
upon
the
market
price
of
general
motors.
and
that's
in
effect
that
will
be
felt
by
all
the
more
than
700,000
shareholders
of
general
motors,
because
any
shareholder
who
has
to
sell
in
that
time
will
suffer
the
effects
of
this
depression.
counsel
for
general
motors
is
going
to
discuss
the
market
in
fact
of
sales
and
i
therefore,
i'm
not
going
to
--
to
say
anything
more
about
that.
there
is
one
other
thing,
however,
that
i
should
like
to
say
about
the
sales.
of
course
that
is
this,
to
the
extent
that
sales
are
ordered,
a
capital
gains
tax
will
be
imposed
on
those
sales.
if
you
sold
all
of
the
65
million
shares,
the
capital
gains
tax
would
be
about
$600,000,000.
to
sell
half
of
them,
it
would
be
about
$300,000,000.
now,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
imposition
of
a
capital
gains
tax
when
a
taxpayer
voluntarily
decides
to
sell
property
on
which
he
has
a
profit
in
order
to
get
his
proceeds,
reinvest
them
in
something
else.
but
this
is
a
forced
sale
and
our
judgment
an
unnecessary
sale
because
it
isn't
required
for
effective
relief.
the
counsel
for
appellant
yesterday
referred
that
the
minnesota
mining
&
manufacturing
company
case,
that
was
the
case
in
which
the
district
court
refused
to
order
dissolution
of
the
company
when
it
found
that
other
relief
was
effective
because
he
thought
the
dissolution
was
unnecessary
and
it
would
impose
the
same
capital
gains
taxes
upon
the
defendant
in
that
case.
i
shall
leave
sales
with
that
discussion,
since
it
would
be
discussed
by
counsel
for
general
motors
and
now
deal
with
the
question
of
distribution
in
a
form
of
dividends.
there
are
three
ways
in
which
that
could
be
done.
one
way
would
be
to
distribute
ratable
numbers
of
these
shares
and
each
of
the
10
years
on
top,
in
addition
to,
the
normal
du
pont
dividend
which
in
the
last
10
years
has
averaged
about
$6
a
year.
a
second
way
would
be
to
--
for
du
pont
to
discontinue
this
cash
dividend
altogether
and
distribute
the
$6
entirely
in
general
motors
stock.
a
third
way
would
be
to
pay
a
part
of
the
$6
dividend,
normal
dividend
in
cash
and
the
balance
in
general
motors
stock.
for
example,
you
pay
might
--
du
pont
might
pay
two-thirds
of
the
dividend
in
cash
and
third
in
stock.
the
tax
and
market
consequences,
the
first
two
ways
of
distributing
the
stock
as
dividend,
on
top
of
the
dividend
or
totally
in
lieu
of
dividend,
are
so
harsh
and
severe
that
as
i
understand
the
appellant's
position,
it's
no
longer
really
talking
about
those.
it
recognizes
that
that
is
something
that
should
not
to
be
done.
so
that
what
is
left
is
really
the
third
alternative,
which
is
to
pay
a
part
of
the
normal
dividend
in
stock
and
the
balance
in
cash.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
well,
i
think
i
was
combining
the
two
things,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
tax
impact
is
very
harsh
and
severe
in
the
first,
where
you
do
it
on
top
of
the
dividend.
the
--
the
--
i
combined
tax
and
market
because
i
was
talking
about
them
together.
the
market
impact
is
much
more
severe
under
the
second
method
than
under
--
than
any
of
the
other
method.
mr.
hugh
b.
cox
the
tax
impact
would
be
normal.
that
is
they
would
pay
no
increased
taxes
and
would
not
be
a
distribution
of
capital
with
some
market
impact
under
the
second,
tax
impact
under
the
first.
so
that,
now,
the
thing
to
--
there
are
two
points
that
i
should
like
to
make
about
this
method
of
distributing
the
stock.
in
the
first
place,
that
method
will
itself
have
some
market
impact.
the
people
who
receive
it
while
our
income
taxes
will
not
to
be
increased,
will
have
to
pay
taxes
and
of
course,
we
all
know
that
people
live
on
dividends
or
when
they
do
not
get
cash
but
get,
say,
a
third
of
the
dividend
in
stock,
they
are
going
to
have
to
sell
that
stock
to
raise
cash
to
pay
taxes
and
for
their
income
purposes.
so
that
--
that
method
of
distribution
will
itself
have
an
impact
on
the
market
price
of
general
motors
stock
and
that
is
a
matter
again
the
counsel
for
general
motors
will
discuss.
the
other
point
i
should
like
to
make
is
that
you
cannot
use
this
method
of
distribution
in
the
10-year
period,
as
suggested
by
appellant,
without
accompanying
it
by
a
very
substantial
sale.
if
you
distribute
a
third
of
the
stock
that
way,
which
is
--
what
would
happen
if
you
pay
the
third
of
the
du
pont
dividend
in
--
in
stock,
it
works
out
that
way,
then
you
would
have
to
be
selling
two
thirds
of
the
stock
in
that
10-year
period.
so
that
the
market
impact
to
those
people
who
stockholders
of
du
pont
who
had
to
sell
because
they
needed
cash
to
pay
taxes
to
live,
would
be
added
to
and
would
enhance
the
market
impact
which
would
be
caused
by
the
sale
of
the
other
two-thirds
of
the
share.
you
would
have
to
have
the
two
things
going
on
in
large
measure
through
the
same
completeness,
to
the
same
period
of
time.
and
of
course,
a
stockholder
of
the
du
pont
company
or
a
stockholder
of
general
motors
who
has
to
sell
his
stock
on
that
depressed
market
is
not
greatly
comforted
by
the
assurance
of
appellant's
counsel
that
no
real
value
has
been
taken
away
from
him
because
in
the
long
run,
the
value
will
still
be
there.
somebody
else
will
have
the
advantage
of
that
value.
if
you
--
if
you
distributed
one-third
of
the
stock
as
a
dividend
and
were
allowed
that
no
other
--
engaged
no
other
method
of
divestiture,
you
could
distribute
the
entire
65
million
shares.
this
is
purely
a
matter
of
arithmetic
in
about
somewhere,
assuming
present
market
prices,
assuming
a
$6
dividend
level
by
du
pont.
you
could
divest
of
the
65
--
the
65
million
shares
in
about
--
somewhere
a
neighborhood
of
34
years.
and
that
--
well,
that
would
have
some
market
consequence
terms
that
general
motors
stock
the
impact
would
be
far
less,
probably
than
the
impact
of
the
other
proposals
that
i
have
discussed.
that
brings
me
to
the
subject
of
exchanges
which
i
fear
that
i
cannot
discuss
in
detail
because
of
the
time,
but
i
should
like
to
say
this
about
it,
as
i
have
said.
this
matter
is
something
that's
brought
into
this
court
for
the
first
time
by
appellant.
i'm
somewhat
surprised
that
it
should've
been
done,
because
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
in
the
district
court,
toward
the
end,
i
ask
in
open
court,
the
appellant,
whether
it
had
any
additional
suggestions
or
modifications
or
proposals
put
before
the
court
with
respect
to
the
plan
that
it
had
proposed.
and
i
said
at
that
time
that
it
would
be
most
unfortunate
in
my
opinion,
if
after
the
record
is
closed
and
there
was
no
opportunity
to
present
evidence,
but
then
appellant
should
come
forward
with
some
proposal
when
they
would
not
have
the
facts
which
the
proposal
could
be
appraised.
well,
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened.
it
seems
to
me
what
has
happened
is
exactly
what
this
court
said
in
the
salt
case
should
not
happen.
you'll
recall
the
court
there
said
in
an
antitrust
case
that
when
a
claim
was
made,
the
modification
of
a
judgment,
the
basis
for
the
claim
should
appear
in
evidentiary
form
before
the
district
court
and
not
an
argumentative
form
before
this
court.
there
is
only
three
points
that
i
can
make
here
about
in
time
that
i
have
about
the
exchanges.
one
is
that
we
think
for
tax
reasons,
it
would
not
be
feasible
or
possible
to
dispose
of
any
substantial
part
of
the
stock
that
way.
appellant
concedes
that
you
have
to
get
a
ruling
in
advance
from
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
before
you
could
do
it.
now,
under
the
regulations,
it
is
our
view
that
the
commissioner
would
never
give
you
that
ruling
whether
good
or
bad
as
to
the
consequences,
until
he
could
determine
a
net
effect
of
the
whole
transaction.
and
with
200,000
shareholders,
to
whom
you
make
a
pro
rata
offer,
you
could
never
determine
that
in
advance
until
you
knew
how
many
were
going
to
exchange
and
how
much
each
one
was
going
to
exchange.
if
appellant
really
thinks
it
would
be
so
easy
to
get
a
--
and
that
a
ruling
would
be
favorable,
i'm
somewhat
surprised
that
appellant
has
not
obtained
the
ruling
itself,
which
it
could
do.
i
think
it
is
asking
the
court
to
assume
that
this
is
--
is
a
feasible
method
of
exchange
merely
on
the
basis
of
an
argumentative
statement
about
the
state
of
the
tax
law,
when
appellant
itself
conceives
that
no
one
is
going
to
exchange
--
engage
in
these
exchanges
unless
there
is
a
prior
ruling
by
the
commissioner.
if
a
stockholder
is
not
interested
in
litigation,
he's
not
going
to
accept
the
assurance
of
counsel
no
matter
how
eminent,
but
he
won't
be
taxed,
he
wants
a
rule.
the
other
point
is
that
--
that
appellant
leaves
the
court
i
fear,
with
the
impression
that
if
you
exchange
this
stock,
you'll
have
no
effect
in
the
market
price
of
general
motors.
what
if
this
--
proposal
had
been
--
been
brought
forward
in
the
district
court,
we
could've
introduced
and
would
have
introduced
evidence
which
was
shown
that
that
was
not
correct.
you're
going
to
have
an
exchange
of
this
kind.
you
were
going
to
have
to
give
the
exchanging
stockholder
a
substantial
premium
or
in
other
words,
you're
going
to
have
to
discount
the
market
value
of
the
general
motors
stock.
share
of
stock,
general
motors
bringing
$40
in
the
market
for
example,
is
going
to
have
to
be
offered
in
the
exchange
at
20%
or
25%
or
30%
discount
from
that
price.
and
the
more
shares
you
want
to
exchange,
the
larger
the
discount
has
to
be.
now,
we
could,
i
think,
have
established
in
the
district
court,
if
this
had
been
done,
the
stock
would've
being
sold
at
a
discounted
price.
that
would've
had
an
effect
on
market
price
of
general
motors
and
indeed
that
about
a
third
of
all
the
stock
exchanged,
would
have
been
thrown
in
a
very
short
time
upon
the
market
and
would
have
had
the
depressing
effect
that
those
sales
would
naturally
have,
since
they
would
be
disorganized
individual
sales
not
under
written
offering.
the
reference
was
made
to
a
proposal
by
--
that
possibility
that
christiana
might
exchange
some
hercules
stock.
that
is
not
in
the
record,
but
i
think
again,
if
i
had
the
time,
i
could
explain
to
the
court
that
that
transaction,
which
involves
a
stock
with
a
market
value
of
1%
of
the
stock
that's
involved
in
this
case,
has
no
relevance
whatsoever
to
this
proposal
that
plaintiff
has
made.
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
transaction,
if
consummated,
is
not
at
all
sure
that
will
be
done,
as
opposed
to
some
other
method
of
disposition,
can
only
be
consummated
on
the
expectation
that
most
of
the
stock
will
be
taken
by
a
smaller
number
of
tax-exempt
institutions.
there's
just
one
more
thing
i
want
to
say
and
i
shall
have
done.
and
i
think
perhaps
that
this
is
an
important
point
although
it
is
implicit
and
never
explicit
in
plaintiff's
argument
but
i
think
it
relates
back
to
something
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said.
i
think
what
appellant
is
really
saying
here
is
that
in
this
case,
because
of
the
size
of
the
company
and
the
wide
attention
the
case
has
received,
that
relief
which
is
merely
effective
in
fact,
relief
which
admittedly
does
away
with
consequences
is
not
really
enough,
but
there
must
be
and
should
be
some
dramatic
and
symbolic
and
ceremonial
act
which
will
symbolize
that
this
relationship
is
forever
terminated.
now,
i
concede
the
importance
of
the
ceremonial
in
the
law,
but
i
raised
a
question
with
the
court
whether
the
injury
of
the
shareholders
that
would
be
caused
by
divestiture
can
be
justified
in
the
name
of
ritual
or
ceremony.
in
hecht
against
bowles,
this
court
said
that
the
essential
qualities
of
equity
jurisdiction
or
practicality
and
mercy,
practicality
and
mercy.
and
that
was
by
the
exercise
of
those
qualities
that
the
court
in
equity
for
the
just
and
reconcile
of
the
public
interest
in
private
needs.
it
is
those
qualities
of
the
court's
equity
jurisdiction,
practicality
and
mercy
which
we
invoke.
we
submit
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
