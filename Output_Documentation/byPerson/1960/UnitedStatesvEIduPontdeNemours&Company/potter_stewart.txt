this
goes

justice

stewart
yes.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
everybody
in
the
united
states
were
shareholder
in
the
general
motors
or
du
pont?is
public
interest
would
be
served
by
carrying
out
the
total
divestiture?
justice
potter
stewart
assuming
everybody
in
united
states
were
shareholder
one
or
the
other,
here
about
--
well,
how
many?
justice
potter
stewart
to
have
everybody
in

pay
tribute
to
the
federal

justice

higher

otherwise.
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least
in
the
internal
revenue
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
didn't
quite
get
you.
justice
potter
stewart
my
--
my
question
was
a
silly
one.
it
was
directed
to
your
point
that
the
--
the
magnitude
of
this
impact
on
the
number
of
people
isn't
important
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
interest.
i
thought
you
said
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
this
does,
this
may
affect,
how
many?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
thousands?
millions
of
people?
justice
potter
stewart
a
million
people,
a
million.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
the
number
of
shareholders
doesn't
make
it
more
serious?
justice
potter
stewart
the
number
of
shareholders
if
anything
would
send,
we
would
have
to
say
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that's
what
i
--
that's
what
i
was
addressing
myself.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
am
i
wrong
in
my
understanding
that
the
government's
plan
would
have
put
the
voting
power
in
the
same
people?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
temporarily
until
they
saw
the
general
motors
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
the
shareholders
of
du
pont.
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
government's
plan,
they
would
--
they
would
get
the
stock
and
therefore,
would
get
the
very
voting
power
that
you're
saying
is
so
simple
right
now.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
they
dispose
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
their
general
motors
or
their
du
pont
shares.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
on
the
effect
that
the
--
the
district
court
has
got
along.
justice
potter
stewart
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
get.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
--
i
was
trying
to
follow
these
--
some
of
these
--
indirect
subterranean
lines
of
communication
and
influence
that
you
were
speculating
about.
i
--
i
don't
quite
understand
how
that
work.
your
basic
--
your
basic
premises
that
whether
or
not
there
were
sterilization,
as
you
call
it,
of
the
voting
power
either
in
du
pont
company
itself
as
it
has
now
provided
or
has
--
has
been
suggested
also
in
the
--
in
the
shareholders
of
the
du
pont
company,
your
basic
proposition
is
that,
nevertheless,
there
would
be
a
very
real
continuing
interest
--
interest
on
the
part
of
du
pont
and
of
its
shareholders
in
the
continuing
prosperity
and
success
of
general
motors.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
see
how
this
would
--
could
be
carried
out
by
all
the
shareholders
buying
plymouths
and
fords.
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
--
if
general
motors,
in
its
own
best
interest
in
order
to
make
maximum
profits
and
run
its
companies
to
--
in
the
best
possible
way
decided
to
buy
chemicals
and
paints
of
somebody
else,
do
you
think
that
shareholders
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
buy
fords
and
plymouths.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
we're
going
to
speculate
and
i'm
just
thinking.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
suggesting
that
congress
is
not
likely
to
exercise
its
sympathy
or
express
its
sympathy
until
it
has
some
to
be
sympathic
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
it
has
it.
justice
potter
stewart
is
these
--
all
these
alternative
suggestions
are
something
new
here
in
this
court,
aren't
they?
this
was
suggested
to
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
--
was
the
--
for
example,
the
tax
consequences
of
this
exchange
alternative
you
just
mention,
was
that
--
was
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
ruling
has
gotten
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
could
be
the
equivalent
of
a
dividend
even
though
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
technically
even
though
it
were
informal
exchange,
could
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
of
what
kind?
a
requirement's
contract?
justice
potter
stewart
any
percentage
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
its
total
requirements.
justice
potter
stewart
that
kind
of
a
contract.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand
the
second
suggestion.
justice
potter
stewart
live
stock.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
just
saying
the
same
thing
if
ever
would.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
need
a
certain
number
of
votes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
understand
why
the
second
alternative
was
so
harsh
from
the
tax
point
of
view.
justice
potter
stewart
but
tax
impact
would
be
nil.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
there
a
special
statute
governing
divestiture
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
there
are
other
ways
of
controlling
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
corporations
to
be
signed
that
being
able
to
vote
as
shareholders
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
it
doesn't
automatically
follow
that
a
nonvoting
shareholder
has
such
--
any
such
control.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
think
mr.
davis
of
the
suggestion
that
the
--
that
the
stock
now
owned
by
du
pont
be
voted
proportionately
to
the
stock
or
the
general
motors
stock
in
the
hands
of
shareholders
in
no
way
connected
with
du
pont?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
preferable
i
suppose
of
this
technically
to
sterilizing
as
the
word's
been
used,
any
--
any
voting
rights
at
all
in
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
except
under
state
law
there
might
--
you
might
need
a
certain
number
of
votes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
but
the
other
provision
would
--
would
put
the
management
of
the
corporation
in
those
shareholders
who
were
completely
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
affiliated
in
any
way
with
du
pont.
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
least
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
least
contained
complete
corporate
democracy
by
all
those
with
that
franchise
to
run
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
those
who
say
the
ones
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
suppose
be
possibly
be
changed.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
addressing
yourself
now
in
a
little
different
point.
that
is
the
-
the
function
of
fact
finding,
rule
52
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
is
findings
of
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
you,
it
seems
to
me
to
put
the
finger
on
it
--
on
a
somewhat
different
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
being
important
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
this
or
is
it
up
to
you
to
argue
here
to
us
as
a
quote
of
equity
now
that
this
is
the
decree
that
you
ideally
should
issue
in
this
case,
rather
isn't
it
--
don't
you
have
to
argue
to
us
that
the
decree
that
was
issued
by
the
district
court
was
an
abuse
of
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
assuming
that
they
didn't
know
any
other
securities
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
not
a
theoretical
projection.
this
was
a
sampling
of
actual
facts.
