mr.
wilkie
bushby
if
the
court
please.
i
represent
christiana
securities
company
and
the
delaware
realty
and
investment
company,
who
are
nominal
defendants
and
appellees
in
this
case.
our
brief
is
the
small
white
brief,
which
i
hope
will
not
be
lost
in
the
shuffle
of
these
large
debts.
these
companies
are
registered
investment
companies
under
the
investment
company
act.
christiana
has
some
4000
stockholders
among
whom
many
charitable
and
educational
institutions
and
insurance
companies.
christiana
and
delaware
together,
own
about
30%
of
the
common
stock
of
du
pont
and
535,000
shares
of
stock
for
general
motors.
they
were
named
as
defendants
in
this
action
with
an
allegation
that
they
had
violated
the
sherman
act.
there
was
no
allegation
that
there
was
any
violation
of
the
clayton
act
by
them,
nor
any
facts
stated
which
would
show
as
such
a
violation.
now,
there
was
no
finding
in
this
case
of
any
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
accordingly,
there
is
no
charge
and
no
finding
of
violation
of
any
law,
any
statute
whatsoever
against
my
clients,
christiana
and
delaware.
because
of
that,
we
have
taken
the
position
that
the
courts
or
without
the
power
or
authority
to
enter
any
order
of
direct
relief
against
them,
without
their
consent
and
they
did
expressly
consent
to
the
minor
amount
of
direct
relief
contained
in
the
present
decree
that
is
the
sterilization
of
the
vote.
however,
the
government
is
not
now
present
for
the
relief
it
asked
for
below
and
you
will
recall,
the
relief
asked
for
below
was
to
have
du
pont
make
annual
distributions
of
all
its
general
motors
stock
for
10
years
and
have
the
stock
allocable
to
my
clients
sold
in
the
market.
that
would've
caused
a
loss
to
my
clients,
as
is
shown
in
the
table
on
the
bottom
of
page
4
of
our
brief,
of
--
from
$233,000,000
to
$430,000,000
depending
on
whether
the
price
realized
was
$46,
the
then
current
market
of
30%
or
30%
to
20%
or
30%
appreciation.
but
that
was
a
real
loss,
it
would
never
be
cured
when
the
stockmarket
came
back
for
general
motors
stock
10
years
hence,
the
stock
would
be
gone.
however,
the
government,
as
i
say,
the
government
isn't
pressing
for
that
relief
here.
and
they
agree
with
us
and
i
point
to
the
footnote
on
page
14
of
the
government's
reply
brief,
where
they
agree
that
the
point
isn't
before
the
court
now
and
is
premature.
and
accordingly,
i'm
not
going
to
argue
it
here.
if
the
court
is
curious,
the
case
is
on
the
point
in
our
brief
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
in
the
footnote.
however,
christiana
and
delaware
have
another
interest
in
this
case.
we
are
stockholders
of
du
pont
and
of
general
motors.
and
i
would
like
to
speak
very
briefly
on
the
merits
with
few
points.
i
think
the
present
decree
is
fully
effective
and
that
the
government's
criticism
of
it
is
fungible.
i
have
been
at
the
bar
40
years,
mostly
in
corporate
field,
and
i
know
of
no
way
out
of
their
investment
to
their
legal
title
for
equity
interest
in
this
general
motors
stock
that
can
be
used
to
influence
general
motors
in
any
way.
if
there
is
one
point
of
proper
criticism
that
both
du
pont
has,
is
going
to
be
passed
through
perpetually
to
du
pont
stockholders,
then
that
could
be
corrected
very
easily.
take
mr.
cox's
suggestion
and
have
that
stock
voted
by
du
pont,
by
court
order
exactly
in
the
same
proportions
if
its
main
body
of
general
motors
stock
is
voted.
those
who
have
no
interest
in
du
pont,
there
can
be
now
possible
use
of
that
stock
or
that
vote
to
influence
the
general
motors.
now,
what
should
be
weighed
by
the
court
in
considering
the
savage
relief
that
government
wants.
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
as
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
did
here,
that
the
clayton
act
is
not
a
penal
statute.
it
is
not
a
criminal
statute,
it
is
purely
remedial.
further,
this
court
simply
held
when
a
case
was
last
here
that
because
of
a
stock
acquisition
in
1918
that
it
was
now
the
possibility
that
that
stock
would
devote
there
along,
might
be
used
to
influence
general
motors'
purchases
of
automotive
paints,
finishes
and
fabrics.
there
was
no
instance
cited
or
no
example
of
the
actual
use
of
that
influence.
accordingly,
there
is
no
crime
here
in
this
case
and
there
is
no
guilt.
and
therefore,
these
statements
in
the
government's
reply
brief
in
page
2
and
15,
that
some
of
the
stockholders
are
associates
of
du
pont's
but
the
decedents
of
du
pont's
that
there's
somehow
guilt
by
association
or
corruption
of
blood
has
no
place
here.
there
isn't
any
crime
of
which
to
be
associated
and
there
is
no
crime
of
which
to
corrupt
blood
of
descendants.
and
i
think
that
ought
to
be
borne
in
mind,
when
the
court
is
exercising
its
equity
powers
here.
there
are
two
other
factors
that
bear
on
the
severe
losses
that
we
suffered
by
two
million
i
think,
beneficial
owners
of
the
stock
of
these
two
companies.
there's
no
use
going
into
detail
over
the
tax
impact.
everybody
knows
it
will
be
severe.
mr.
justice
douglas
as
a
past
chairman
of
the
s.e.c.
knows
it.
the
tax
impact
was
severe
in
the
enforcement
of
the
public
utility
holding
company
act
and
that
has
impeded
enforcement
and
that
the
losses
of
employments
played
under
the
tax
laws
of
1950s
and
where
under
the
tax
laws
of
the
1930s.
and
i
say
that
--
mr.
wilkie
bushby
yes,
because
of
the
enforcement
being
impeded,
mr.
justice
douglas
was
sponsor
of
the
amendment
of
tax
laws
to
help
the
enforcement
of
that
act.
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
the
government
has
no
right
to
come
here
and
offer
tax
plans,
exchange
plans
and
on
mere
assertion
that
they
are
practicable,
they
had
the
opportunity
to
put
those
plans
in
evidence
in
the
court
below
and
we
could've
met
--
and
i
say
if
it's
an
improper
--
that
a
procedure
--
and
i
say
the
proper
procedure
is
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
effectiveness
of
this
decree
to
let
them
go
in
the
district
court
under
section
9
of
the
decree,
show
us
something
wrong
and
then
prove
these
other
methods.
and
show
that
practicable
and
we
will
meet
them
there.
as
to
the
market
impact,
every
single
and
practical
investment
manner
testified
whether
for
the
government
or
for
the
companies
in
the
court
below,
said
there
would
be
a
serious
market
impact
15%,
20%,
25%,
in
case
the
government
plan
there
proposed
was
carried
out.
now
again,
there's
no
use
going
into
the
trivia
of
the
evidence,
that
every
factual
man
in
the
court
said
that
would
be
so.
finally,
i'd
like
to
close
by
saying
this,
that
there's
nothing
to
the
legal
point
that
divestiture
is
mandatory
under
the
clayton
act.
to
hold
that
would
seriously
circumscribe
and
limit
the
equity
power
to
this
court.
it's
been
enforced
of
45
years
and
nobody
ever
grant
that
point
up
before.
it
just
doesn't
exist.
and
as
i
say,
it
would
so
limit
the
powers
to
this
court
is
to
be
a
very
bad
thing,
very
bad,
stopped
in
the
modern
trend
and
we
very
seriously
the
stockholders
of
these
companies
very
seriously
need
the
equity
powers
of
this
court
right
now.
