justice
potter
stewart
before
you
go
on,
i
just
i
want
to
get
one
thing
clear.
the
testimony
was
bought
as
to
how
long
a
distance
it
would
have
taken
to
make
an
ordinary,
none
emergency
stop.
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
station
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
500
or
600
feet.
justice
potter
stewart
i
had
understood
the
plaintiff's
theory
to
be
that
an
emergency
stop
would
have
been
required
even
to
stop
the
train
in
180
feet.
justice
potter
stewart
by
means
of
an
emergency
stop,
the
suicide
would
not
have
been
consummated
and
therefore,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
would
not
have
had
the
guilty
delusion
that
she
was
guilty
of
the
death
of
the
--
the
suicide.
justice
potter
stewart
but
still
it
would
have
been
an
emergency
stop.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
still
have
caused
the
--
whatever
physical
injury
was
done
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
where
--
where
is
that
testimony?
can
you
tell
us
the
meaning
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
about
the
length
of
the
train
into
the
train
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
--
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
that
--
what
he
should
have
begun
would
not
have
been
an
emergency
brake
application
even
assuming
he
was
180
feet
away?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
actually
you
didn't
--
let
me
ask
you
this
way,
is
there
anything
in
the
evidence
to
show
either
directly
or
by
inference,
how
long
it
would
take
--
how
--
how
long
a
distance
--
a
train
running
for
13
to
15
miles
an
hour
would
be
required
to
make
a
stop
and
it
whether
it
would
be
an
emergency
stop
or
any
other
kind
of
stop?
is
there
any
kind
of
evidence
of
any
kind
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
evidence
as
to
how
great
the
distance
--
any
other
kind
of
stop
would've
taken?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
about
600
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
what
you're
suggesting
to
us
as
i
understand
it
is,
assuming
that
the
engineer
should've
seen
the
woman
when
he
was
180
feet
away
and
should've
done
--
should've
seen
a
woman
in
the
track,
right
in
front
of
the
train
that
it
was
--
that
it
would've
been
negligence
for
him
at
that
time
to
apply
an
emergency
stop
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
--
i
was
wondering
what
the
evidence
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
that
conclusion.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
see
a
woman
a
180
feet
ahead
of
a
locomotive,
moving
a
15
miles
an
hour,
it's
negligence
to
apply
an
emergency
stop.
that's
--
that's
what
you're
telling
us,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
to
quite
sort
of
balance
the
rights
of
the
woman
on
the
track
and
the
plaintiff
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
clarify
what
was
in
my
mind
(inaudible)
that
would
help
you.
i
--
i
wanted
whether
it
was
your
theory
that
the
defendant
railroad
and
the
exercise
of
ordinary
care
could
have
avoided
killing
mrs.
montell
or
whether
it
was
your
theory
in
the
exercise
of
ordinary
care,
the
railroad
could
avoid
making
an
emergency
stop
which
is
after
all
what
caused
the
physical
damage
to
the
plaintiff?
justice
potter
stewart
within
--
with
this
particular
physical
trauma
that
she
received
as
a
result
of
an
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
emergency
stop.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
negligence
therefore
has
to
consist
in
making
the
emergency
stop,
is
that
right?
