mr.
james
w.
kelleher
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
difficult
case
in
which
to
explain
the
plaintiff's
position.
there
can't
be
any
question
about
that
and
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
shall
now
attempt
to
do
so.
the
plan
before
the
court
is
a
reproduction
of
the
right
hand
side
of
exhibit
1
in
this
case.
exhibit
1
is
a
plan
scaled
to
20th
as
to
--
20
feet
to
the
edge
which
shows
the
platform
where
this
accident
happened.
this
is
the
arrow
showing
the
direction,
the
train
came
in
from
boston.
i'm
sorry,
this
is
the
arrow
showing
the
direction,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
train
came
in
from
the
east
from
boston,
on
the
track
here
marked
track
3.
there's
a
long
platform
which
begins
here.
the
canopy
over
the
platform
begins
here.
it's
called
the
key
shelter.
that
is
held
up
by
a
number
of
posts.
i
believe
there
are13
of
them
to
the
east
of
this
kiosk.
there
are
two
kiosks
but
this
is
the
eastern
most
one
on
exhibit
1
and
we're
concerned
only
with
that
part
of
the
platform.
i
ask
the
court
to
note
also
the
crossing
which
appears
at
this
part
of
the
platform.
it
is
the
crossing
enabling
trucks
to
be
carried
across
the
tracks
at
that
point
from
the
platform.
the
court
will
also
notice
a
wooden
picket
fence
which
runs
along
in
the
south
side
of
the
track
dividing
this
track
from
another
which
was
to
the
south.
that
fence,
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
with
the
locus
here
is
pierced
by
a
gate
at
only
one
point,
opposite
to
the
crossing
which
i
called
the
court
attention.
now,
what
in
essence
do
we
say
about
this
case?
we
say
it
is
a
strong
plaintiff's
negligence
case
at
common
law.
we
don't
rely
on
scintillas.
we
think
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
plaintiff,
and
have
never
contended
otherwise,
and
we
think
that
it
is
amply
sustained
by
the
evidence
in
this
case,
that
it
is
a
strong
plaintiff's
case.
why
do
we
say
so?
the
accident
was
brought
about
by
the
appearance
of
a
woman
named
montell,
on
the
track.
she
was
in
that
--
on
the
platform,
apparently,
one
of
the
persons
waiting
for
this
train,
which
was
to
make
a
stop
on
its
way
to
new
york.
her
position
on
this
plan
is
placed
pretty
exactly
and
there's
no
dispute
about
this
evidence,
i
believe.
there
is
a
witness
named
brewster
who
said
that
he
came
up
this
stairway
here
and
walked
eastward.
he
was
waiting
for
this
train
also,
he
walked
eastward
to
the
fifth
post,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
and
he
stood
there
waiting
for
the
train.
and
as
he
stood
there,
mrs.
montell,
who
was
later
killed,
approached
and
asked
him
something.
there
was
a
short
conversation
and
she
then
moved
20
feet
to
the
east,
which
on
this
plan
because
it
is
twice
the
size,
twice
the
scale
of
the
--
twice
the
size
of
the
exhibit,
20
feet
on
this
plan
is
2
inches.
so
brewster
was
here
and
mrs.
montell
talked
with
him
here
at
the
fifth
post
and
she
then
moved
about
to
that
position.
there's
no
substantial
dispute.
i
don't
believe
there's
any
dispute
about
it.
now,
the
engineer
says,
and
he
was
the
first
witness
and
the
principal
witness
on
liability,
the
engineer
in
a
statement
made
prior
to
the
trial,
we
saw
on
deposition
or
on
discovery,
motion
for
discovery,
the
engineer
said
that
he
saw
this
woman
first
when
she
was
40
feet
away
from
him,
she
stepped
into
the
tracks
and
in
that
pretrial
statement
made
with
the
railroad
people,
was
asked
a
specific
question,
"did
you
see
her
step
from
the
platform?"
and
he
said,
"no,
i
did
not."
he
was
asked
whether
there
was
any
--
were
any
obstacles
in
his
way
and
he
said
he
didn't
recollect
that
there
were
any.
this
is
in
the
pretrial
statements
at
the
railroads.
it
was
because
of
that
curious
statement
of
his
that
he
didn't
see
this
woman
although
she
was
only
40
feet
away,
but
he
didn't
see
her
step
from
the
platform
onto
the
track
that
this
case
was
tried.
and
when
he
appeared
on
the
stand
at
the
witness,
it
developed
that
there
was
an
obstacle
which
prevented
him
from
seeing
her
step
from
the
platform
and
the
obstacle
was
a
baggage
truck
or
trucks
on
the
platform
and
he
places
that
obstacle
on
the
platform.
he
says
it
was
at
the
east
end
of
the
platform
before
you
get
to
the
canopy.
looking
at
another
exhibit
which
is
a
photograph
facing
east
or
the
right
of
the
plan,
he
said,
"they
were
just
beyond
the
crossing."
so
we
feel
fully
justified
in
placing
them
in
the
most
favorable
position
for
the
railroad
which
is
where
i
have
put
the
red
letter
b.
we
think
the
evidence
was
warrant
placing
them
farther
to
the
east
and
even
beyond
the
end
of
the
canopy.
but
we
are
placing
them
here,
which
is
the
most
favorable
position
for
the
defendant.
now,
if
the
baggage
trucks
were
there
and
mrs.
montell
was
here
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
the
witness
proves
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
the
witness
proves
it
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
he
says
immediately
before
the
train
arrived,
as
the
train
was
coming
in.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes.
it's
at
page
107
to
109
is
the
complete
testimony
on
this
subject
as
i
remember
it.
on
page
108,
he's
asked
before
the
train
came
in,
"can
you
tell
us
what
if
anything
you
saw
there
or
anything
that
happened?"
he
recounts
a
conversation
that
mrs.
montell,
the
spokeswoman
spoke
in
english
that
this
was
train
to
new
york
and
so
on
and
so
on.
"that
conversation
took
place
about
the
fifth
post?"
the
answer
is
yes.
"had
she
have
been
to
your
left
before
you
engage
in
conversation?"
the
answer,
"she
was
to
my
left,
yes."
"then
after
you
engaged
in
conversation,
what
did
she
do?
the
answer,
"she
moved
back
to
the
left
again.
how
far
back
to
the
left
that
she
moved?
the
answer;
"about
20
feet
or
so."
he
does
say
that
he
did
not
continuously
observed
her
until
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
that's
correct.
that's
the
answer.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
rely
on
nothing
in
his
testimony,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
rely
on
his
only
testimony
and
on
inferences
drawn
from
the
position
of
the
baggage
trucks
which
he
testifies
too.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
there
are.
now,
may
i
deal
with
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
one
of
them
says
five
feet.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
rely
on
nobody's
direct
testimonies
stating
a
measurement.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
alright.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
may
i
proceed
to
--
go
into
that.
may
i
first
state,
however,
with
respect
to
the
witnesses
who
testified
that
the
train
was
on
top
of
her
when
she
stepped
off
the
platform
and
one
of
them
says
particularly
that
the
train
was
five
feet
away.
those
witnesses
were
all
on
the
platform
in
this
general
assembly.
they
were
farther
away
from
the
train
than
she
was.
they
were
obviously
looking
at
the
worst
possible
angle
with
just
any
distance
between
the
train
and
her.
that's
an
almost
impossible
angle
at
which
the
judge
does
--
she
and
the
train
were
almost
in
the
line,
so
where
it
goes
with
(inaudible).
now,
may
i
proceed
to
the
inference
upon
which
we
rely?
the
engineer
says
the
baggage
tracks
were
here.
that
is
the
most
favorable
testimony,
the
construction
of
his
testimony
--
the
construction
most
favorable
to
the
railroad.
mr.
brewster
said
that
mrs.
montell
just
before
the
train
came
in
was
here.
the
engineer
also
said
that
he
did
not
see
mrs.
montell
step
off
the
platform
and
he
says
more
than
that.
he
said
he
didn't
see
her
stepped
off
the
platform
because
the
baggage
trucks
were
in
the
way.
and
if
that
is
so,
i
submit
to
the
court,
it
necessarily
follows
by
the
laws
of
optics
and
geometry
that
the
baggage
tracks
were
closer
to
mrs.
montell
than
he
was
when
she
stepped
off
the
platform.
that
has
to
be
so
or
they
would
not
have
blocked
his
vision.
furthermore,
a
not
particularly
sophisticated
jury
it
seems
to
me
with
plan
one
in
front
of
them
could
do
this.
they
can
put
a
ruler,
one
end
of
it
on
hand
the
other
montell
and
other
end
on
the
position
of
the
baggage
trucks
and
they
could
draw
the
inference.
indeed,
they're
compelled
to
draw
it,
it
seems
to
me
from
the
assumptions,
if
i
may,
from
the
testimony,
that
the
engineer
is
somewhere
on
the
line
marked
by
that
ruler.
he
is
also
of
just
above
the
right
hand
rear
of
the
track,
so
he
must
be
about
where
i
have
marked
that
east,
when
she
stepped
on
the
platform.
and
a
measurement
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
well,
now
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
will
go
into
that
in
just
a
moment
if
i
may.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
it
is.
yes
your
honor,
but
at
any
rate,
before
i
get
to
that,
if
i
may
show
the
outline
of
the
inference
of
what
we're
seeing
here,
which
i
submit
to
the
court
is
not
greatly
sophisticated.
the
engineer
was
up
here
some
place
where
i've
made
this
mark
determined
by
the
straight
line
drawn
here.
when
she
stepped
from
the
platform,
and
the
court
will
notice
this
platform
is
slightly
curved
and
that's
the
only
reason
the
baggage
trucks
on
the
platform
could've
blocked
his
views.
by
the
time
he
becomes
abreast
of
those
baggage
trucks,
his
view
can
no
longer
be
blocked,
but,
he
has
a
straight
view
along
the
track
of
this
woman
who
by
that
time
has
taken
a
couple
of
steps
since
in
the
middle
of
the
track
where
he
first
saw
her.
now,
it's
a
matter
of
simple
measurement
on
the
scaled
plan
to
determine
that
the
distance
from
montell
to
the
baggage
trucks
is
a
180
feet.
and
it
follows
that
when
the
engineer
was
180
feet
from
her,
he
could
see
her
clearly
with
no
obstructed
view.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
no.
i
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
if
the
court
will
indulge
me,
i
have
had
some
success
in
explaining
this
case
that
i
must
take
it
one
thing
at
a
time.
i
shall
come
to
that
in
a
moment
if
i
may.
at
any
rate,
i
now
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
jury
was
abundantly
warranted
in
finding
that
this
engineer
could
and
should
have
seen
her
when
he
is
180
feet
away.
he's
going
about
20
feet
a
second.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
he
could
and
should've
seen
her
for
nine
second
seconds
before
he
hit
her.
the
testimony
and
its
undisputed
again
is
that
he
did
nothing
--
it
did
if
the
nine
second
inference
is
correct,
he
did
nothing
for
eight
seconds
with
a
helpless
woman
on
the
track,
a
woman
who
the
railroad
says
is
an
obvious
suicide
or
at
best,
the
woman
who
isn't
where
she
belongs,
who
was
on
a
track
going
toward
a
fence,
in
which
there
is
no
opening
to
the
engineer's
knowledge,
and
so
testified
to
this,
his
is
familiar
with
the
station,
no
opening
in
the
tracks.
now,
i
should
like
to
go
into
detail
for
just
a
moment
about
the
second
or
so
and
what
happened
during
that
period,
the
second
or
so
during
which
the
engineer
passed
from
this
point
to
this
point.
it
connects
with
what
he
saw
or
should've
seen
of
mrs.
montell.
now,
if
the
court
please,
he
says
very
clearly
that
he
didn't
see
her
step
off
the
platform.
he
didn't
see
her
that
she
was
in
the
middle
of
the
track
and
he
says
more
than
that.
he
says
that
he
was
prevented
from
seeing
her
by
baggage
trucks.
now,
i
will
agree
that
that's
a
conclusion
of
the
witness
in
a
sense.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
well,
let
me
come
to
this.
i
tried
to
put
this
to
him
very
concretely.
i
--
i
have
given
the
evidence
on
page
16
of
the
brief.
i
said
to
him
there,
here
is
the
platform
and
i
tried
to
illustrate
it.
here
is
my
foot
on.
now,
when
i
say
you
didn't
see
her
step
off
the
platform
onto
the
track,
i
mean
you
never
saw
her
when
she
had
one
foot
on
the
platform?
answer,
"no,
sir."
question:
"no
doubt
about
that?"
answer:
"no,
sir"
and
you
say
there
was
something
that
stopped
you
from
seeing
her?"
"well,
that's
why
i
said
i
corrected
my
statement
afterwards.
there
were
these
trucks
out
there.
now,
in
listening
to
that
testimony,
may
it
please
the
court,
counsel
tried
with
some
further
(inaudible)
to
make
this
clear
as
possible
at
the
trial
and
there
was
further
examination
in
which
we
tried
to
put
it
very
concretely.
it's
given
on
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief.
he
was
asked,
"did
you
see
her
before
she
got
to
the
first
rail?"
and
his
answer
to
that
is,
he
repeats
the
question,
"before
she
got
to
the
first
rail?
question
here.
answer,
"i
didn't
see
her
until
she
got
her
foot
over
the
rail
in
the
middle
of
the
rails."
that's
on
page
17.
now,
may
i
say
this
to
the
court?
this
is
the
plan
with
its
scale
shows
that
the
distance
from
the
end
to
the
platform
to
the
nearer
rail
is
two
and
a
half
feet.
the
testimony
of
a
number
of
witnesses
which
i
won't
refer
to
in
detail
now
was
that
this
woman
didn't
--
not
that
she
dived
onto
the
track
or
plunged
onto
the
track.
the
testimony
was,
she
walked
slowly
onto
the
track
and
if
that
be
so,
she
most
certainly
did
not
or
the
jury
need
not
have
found
that
she
took
her
step
of
two
and
a
half
feet
on
her
first
step.
she
was
a
woman,
52
years
old
and
i
think
the
jury
would
amply
warrant
the
finding
that
she
could
not
have
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
track
on
her
first
step
and
must
have
done
so
on
her
second
step
or
at
some
later
step.
now,
if
that
is
so
it
appears
very
persuasively
from
the
evidence
that
i
can
summarize
that
what
happened
is
this.
when
the
engineer
was
here,
mrs.
montell
was
taking
her
first
step
off
the
platform
and
placing
her
foot
between
the
platform
and
the
nearer
rail.
he
could
not
see
her
with
them
because
of
the
baggage
trucks.
as
he
passed
from
here
to
here,
the
baggage
trucks
ceased
to
obscure
his
view
and
at
the
same
time,
she
took
her
second
step
across
the
nearer
rail
and
he
saw
her
in
the
middle
of
the
tracks
and
that
is
his
testimony.
now,
that
places
him
180
feet
from
her,
nine
seconds
away.
now,
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
no,
that
was
some
other
evidence.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
think
i
have
summarized
that
in
this
brief.
now,
what
conclusions
do
we
draw
from
that?
here
is
an
engineer,
an
employee
of
the
railroad,
who
knows
that
there
are
dinning
cars
on
the
train,
knows
those
dinning
cars
have
waitresses,
he
knows
the
waitresses
are
serving
food.
this
is
in
the
morning
at
breakfast
time.
he
knows
that
to
serve
food,
you've
got
to
go
to
a
counter
and
get
it
and
you've
got
to
be
standing.
and
he
knows
when
you
say
he
submit
that
--
that
this
woman,
the
plaintiff
was
in
a
peculiarly
exposed
position
by
reason
of
her
employment.
now,
he
owes
her
some
duties
of
care,
he
owes
her
duty
of
care
we
say
also,
although
we're
not
directly
concerned
with
it
to
persons
that
may
appear
on
the
track.
he
owed
mrs.
montell
at
some
degree
of
care
when
as
an
apparent
suicide
or
perhaps
only
as
bewildered
woman
she
appeared
on
the
track
in
front
of
him.
what
should
he
have
done?
there
is
a
testimony
as
mr.
deering
says
that
he
was
coming
in
to
make
a
normal
station
stop.
he
would've
stopped
--
i
think
the
testimony
is
in
six
or
eight
car
lengths.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
think
it's
at
page
38.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
that
it
would
have
making
a
normal
station
stop.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
he
says
it's
a
guessed.
there
is
a
little
more
of
it
on
page
39.
he
says
on
page
39,
that
the
train
would
practically
have
stopped
her
so
for
with
a
real
length
brake
application
in
six
or
eight
car
length.
that's
about
a
third
of
the
weight
down
on
page
39.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
well,
that
was
--
eight
cars
as
i
remember.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
on
the
other
hand,
it's
not
disputed
that
the
emergency
stop
which
actually
occurred
brought
the
train
to
stop
in
about
80
feet.
now,
i
think
there
is
--
there
are
intermediate
types
of
stop
which
certainly
could
have
been
made
here.
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
a
normal
station
stop
when
you
glide
to
a
stop
in
six
or
eight
car
lengths,
and
an
emergency
stop
which
throws
china
and
dishes
off
the
tables.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
as
to
this?
oh,
there's
a
bunch
of
evidence
of
that.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
there
is
testimony
as
to
the
break
in
the
various
positions
in
which
it
might
have
been
placed.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
think
that's
at
page
20
--
28
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
not
necessarily
your
honor.
i
don't
know
whether
he
could've
done
that
or
not
with
safety
to
the
plaintiff,
i
don't
know.
but
we
suggest
what
he
should've
done
was
this,
he
sees
her
180
feet
away,
she
is
either
an
apparent
suicide
or
she
is
a
woman
in
a
dangerous
position
who
doesn't
belong
where
she
is,
he
should
have
begun
some
kind
of
brake
application
immediately.
perhaps
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
well,
there
are
--
he
describes
the
brake
in
the
various
positions
in
which
it
could've
been
placed.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
that's
on
page
27
there.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
well,
mr.
deering
has
stated
and
i
--
so
far
in
this
case
has
been
assumed
that
this
train
would
stop
with
an
emergency
stop
in
about
80
feet.
there
was
no
expert
testimony
on
this.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
only
the
evidence
which
i
have
referred
to
with
respect
to
the
six
or
eight
car
lengths
which
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
--
normal
station
stop
between
those
two.
there
is
no
specific
evidence
as
to
how
far
the
train
would
have
gone
with
any
particular
break
application.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
i
am
suggesting
that.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
am
suggesting
that
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
suggest
that
for
this
reason
that
he
must
know
if
he
does
apply
an
emergency
stops
that
he
is
very
likely
to
cause
grave
injury
to
persons
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiff,
and
that's
why
he
shouldn't
do
it.
that's
why
it's
negligence.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
if
that
have
been
--
no,
that
is
not
what
i
am
talking
about.
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
evidence
shows.
the
evidence
shows
that
he
didn't
apply
the
brake
until
he
got
within
40
feet
of
--
of
her.
it
doesn't
show
that
he
applied
it
when
he
was
180
feet
away.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
if
he
had
dealing
with
that
hypothetical
case.
if
he
had
done
so
in
candor,
i
will
say
that
if
where
the
evidence
that
he
had
thrown
the
break
into
full
emergency
way
over
to
the
right
and
you
described
its
positions,
i
would
say
he
was
negligent
to
the
plaintiff,
yes.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes.
because
of
her
being
exposed
to
this
standing
position.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
well,
i
should
be
the
last
one
to
say
that
his
position
was
an
easy
one.
i
think
that
what
he
would've
done
in
the
cases
--
the
common
law
cases,
i
have
cited
one
from
the
court
of
appeal
of
new
york
very
--
situation
very
similar
to
this,
it
suggests
that
he
ought
to
start
applying
the
brakes.
he
doesn't
have
to
put
them
on
full
force
and
the
important
point
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
is
if
he
had
done
it
when
180
feet
away.
i
think
the
jury
could've
concluded
that
something
sort
of
an
emergency
application
is
made
at
180
feet
away
would've
permitted
mrs.
montell
to
escape.
but,
the
point
in
this
case,
and
i
wish
now
to
refer
to
another
piece
of
evidence
that
i
have
not
yet
referred
to,
the
point
in
this
case
is
that,
had
he
made
–
done
substantial
application
of
the
brake
at
this
point
when
he
got
to
the
crossing
short
of
a
full
emergency
application,
the
plaintiff
would've
been
warned
of
what
was
going
on
and
there
is
a
testimony
to
that
effect
that
these
girls
listen
for
break
applications.
they
were
accustomed
to
do
so
and
she
would
have
been
able
to
perhaps
assume
a
sitting
position
or
at
least
hold
on
to
the
counter
and
brace
herself.
the
testimony
here
is
there
was
absolutely
no
warning
whatsoever.
the
witness
in
describing
this
stop,
the
other
hostess
said
to
judge
wyzanski
in
an
answer
to
a
question
of
his,
it
was
just
a
sudden
stop,
period.
no
warning.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
apparently,
he
had
been
having
light
applications
so
that
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
apparently
that
maybe
so
your
honor.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
there
is
no
testimony
one
way
or
the
other.
i
suppose
that
they
would've
heard
those
too.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
that
is
clear.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
well,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
understand
it,
that
bears
on
the
question
of
contributory
negligence
for
possible
contributory
negligence.
i
don't
think
we're
concerned
with
it
here.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
measure
of
his
--
when
one
is
trying
to
measure
what
a
reasonable
man
in
his
position
would've
done,
recognizing
his
position
is
one
of
some
difficulty.
i
think
one
must
take
into
account
that
he
knew
there
were
these
types
of
employees.
there
is
no
direct
evidence
of
such
knowledge
with
--
the
railroad
certainly
knew
that
they
are
exposed
by
reason
of
their
employment,
who
--
if
she
was
in
danger.
the
case
i
have
cited
from
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
a
case
very
similar
in
its
facts
to
this,
it's
a
common
law
case
and
i
have
decided
--
cited
that
deliberately
because
it
is
a
common
law
case,
and
because
i
want
to
get
away
from
any
implication
here
that
this
is
some
kind
of
extreme
case,
which
require
some
kind
of
extreme
rule
as
to
liability
or
as
to
quantum
of
evidence.
we
don't
think
it
does
and
we
don't
ask
for
the
application
of
any
such
a
supreme
rule.
if
new
york
court
of
appeal
case
is
a
common
law
action
by
a
passenger,
a
seated
passenger.
the
train
was
coming
along
toward
a
crossing.
an
old
man
was
pushing
a
lawn
mower
toward
the
crossing.
the
engineer
and
the
fireman
saw
this
when
they
were
some
500
feet
away,
the
train
was
going
about
the
same
speed
at
this
one,
a
little
slower
i
think.
they
proceed
on,
no
brake
application,
when
they
get
to
within
a
couple
of
hundred
feet,
the
engineer
says
to
the
--
or
the
fireman
said
to
the
engineer,
"hey!
he's
not
going
to
stop
and
the
old
man
kept
pushing
his
lawn
mower."
he
was
hit
and
killed.
they
stopped
suddenly,
hit
him,
killed
him
as
mrs.
montell
was
killed
here
as
a
result
of
the
sudden
stop,
a
passenger
was
thrown
against
his
seat.
so,
the
measure
of
liability
was
ordinary
negligence
and
it
was
held
that
there
was
an
ample
evidence
for
ordinary
negligence
in
that
case.
that's
the
door
case
in
211
new
york.
i
do
wish
to
make
a
--
i
realized
that
i
may
have
gone
way
over
my
time.
i
shall
have
to
leave
the
new
trial
question
to
the
brief
if
i
may
do
so.
i
wish
to
say
and
make
it
clear,
however,
having
reference
to
a
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
that
we
do
not
--
well,
i
--
i
think
that
a
question
of
your
as
if
i
may
say
so
mr.
justice
stewart,
suggested
that
we
--
we
said
that
the
--
as
mrs.
montell
was
killed
here,
and
because
our
plaintiff
happen
to
have
that
peculiar
time
to
paranoia
delusion,
that's
the
evidence
consisted
in
killing
mrs.
montell
and
--
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
i
don't
know
whether
the
railroad
could've
had
avoided
it
and
i
don't
see
how
the
jury
could
know
that.
it
could've
avoided
killing
mrs.
montell.
i
think
a
finding
would
be
warranted
--
the
train
could've
been
stopped
without
killing
mrs.
montell
had
the
engineer
had
been
as
careful
as
he
should
have.
i
do
not
know
whether
the
engineer
could've
avoided
killing
her
without
making
an
emergency
stop.
i
think
it's
probably
doubtful
that
the
jury
could
so
find
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
apparently
just
remained
on
the
track
if
she
approached
her.
there's
no
effort
for
her
own
safety,
but
in
our
mind,
the
liability
here
doesn't
depend
on
whether
or
not
mrs.
montell
was
killed
or
whether
or
not
mrs.
montell
could've
been
saved
by
due
care.
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
take
a
view
of
this
evidence
which
is
to
the
effect
that
the
engineer
could've
been
entirely
careful
for
the
plaintiff
and
yet
killed
mrs.
montell
and
we
attach
no
importance
to
the
paranoia
delusion
which
our
client
unquestionably
had
as
the
result
of
this
evidence
except
to
show
that
the
paranoia
is
causally
connected
with
this
particular
event.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
but
that's
the
only
importance
we
attach
into
the
paranoia.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
yes,
yes.
mr.
james
w.
kelleher
thank
you
very
much.
