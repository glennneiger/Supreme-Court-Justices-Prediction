mr.
noel
w.
deering
may
it
please
the
court.
this
was
the
case
which
rose
under
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
and
the
facts
are
somewhat
unusual.
the
plaintiff
below,
the
respondent
in
this
court,
was
a
dining
car
waitress
who
was
employed
by
the
defendant,
petitioner
in
this
case,
as
--
on
the
--
on
a
dining
car
on
the
train
which
was
en
route
from
boston
to
new
york
city.
and
on
the
11th
day
of
october
1954,
she
sustained
an
injury
when
the
train
came
to
a
sudden
stop
at
the
station
of
providence,
rhode
island.
the
circumstances
of
the
stop
with
this;
there
was
a
lady
by
the
name
of
montell
who
had
been
on
the
station
platform
as
the
train
was
approaching
the
baker
station
stop
at
providence
and
for
some
reason,
apparently
to
commit
suicide
as
all
of
the
facts
indicate
and
i
think
the
respondent
concedes,
she
stepped
out
in
front
of
the
train
and
the
engineer
in
an
effort
to
avoid
running
over
her,
an
effort
which
is
unsuccessful,
brought
the
train
to
a
sudden
stop
and
this
hostess
in
the
dining
car
was
thrown
about,
she
was
in
the
rear
car
of
the
train,
an
eight-car
train,
and
received
some
injuries
as
a
result
of
the
sudden
stop.
now,
the
platform
at
the
providence
station
is
between
two
tracks
of
this
particular
platform.
the
train
was
coming
in
on
the
left
hand
side.
the
platform
is
somewhat
on
a
curve,
beginning
at
the
east
end
of
the
station
and
the
train
comes
around
the
--
from
boston
into
the
providence
station
on
this
curve,
part
of
the
platform
but
not
all
of
that
is
covered
by
(inaudible).
there
were
some
baggage
trucks
on
the
station
platform
at
the
time
the
accident
happened.
the
respondent
attaches
great
deal
of
significance
to
the
presence
of
the
baggage
trucks
there
as
having
some
causal
connection
to
the
injury,
although
i
think
he
doesn't
claim
that
there
was
any
negligence
in
having
in
there.
it
was
the
merely
part
in
preventing
the
engineer
from
seeing
the
woman
on
the
track
as
soon
as
it
was
claimed
he
might
have
seen
her.
the
evidence
indicates
that
as
this
engineer
was
coming
along
the
track,
he
had
reached
the
point
he
was
going
at
a
speed
of
some
13
to
15
miles
an
hour
having
slowed
down
to
make
the
normal
station
stop
which
would
have
been
some
few
100
feet
beyond
the
point
where
the
accident
happened.
and
at
that
speed,
he
testified
that
his
train
would
have
come
through
a
--
an
ordinary
stop
without
any
ajar
as
such
as
occurred
in
this
case.
his
testimony
was
that
when
he
was
within
about
40
feet
of
where
the
woman
stepped
off,
he
saw
her
stepping
over
the
first
rail
of
the
rail
nearest
to
the
platform.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
think
the
testimony
was
that
in
making
an
odd
--
well,
he
had
slowed
down
to
make
the
ordinary
emergency
--
non-emergency
stop.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
at
that
time,
and
it
would
have
to
take
him
about
500
or
600
feet
as
i
recall.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
500
or
600
feet,
i
think
the
testimony
was
that
he
would
have
taken
to
make
the
regular
stop
that
he
intended
to
take
there.
actually,
the
stop
which
he
made
was
within
about
80
feet
in
emergency
and
his
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
several
witnesses
who
were
on
the
platform
indicated
that
when
the
woman
stepped
off
in
front
of
the
train,
he
was
about
a
100
--
he
was
about
40
feet
although
the
respondent
here
argues
that
by
certain
testimony
that
the
engineer
gave
in
regard
to
the
providence
baggage
trucks
on
the
platform,
he
must
have
been
considerably
farther
away
than
that.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that
is
what
i
understand
the
plaintiff's
theory
is.
yes.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
submit
that
there
was
no
evidence.
the
--
the
plaintiff
has
worked
it
out
on
the
theory
involving
the
presence
of
baggage
trucks
on
the
platform
which
the
engineer
testified
at
one
point
that
there
were
baggage
trucks
at
the
east
end
of
the
platform
which
obstructed
his
views
and
that
he
did
not
see
the
woman
while
she
was
on
the
platform
but
he
first
noticed
her
when
she
was
putting
one
foot
over
the
rail
nearest
to
the
platform
which
of
course
would
--
as
i
have
argued
here
in
my
brief
and
argue
now
that
from
a
place
of
safety
on
the
platform
to
the
place
where
the
engineer
saw
her
in
the
place
of
danger
was
a
distance
of
--
of
perhaps
two
or
three
feet.
testimony
is
at
the
edge
of
the
platform
to
the
first
rail
with
the
distance
of
approximately
two
feet.
now,
whether
she
had
to
step
down
from
the
platform
and
then
take
another
step
over
the
rail
but
any
event
the
engineer
said
that
he
saw
her
first
when
she
was
stepping
over
the
first
rail
which
was
two
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
platform.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
yes,
sir.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
yes,
sir.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
think.
yes,
i
think
that
was
a
testimony,
sir.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that
--
that
was
the
testimony
as
i
recall
it.
the
engineer
said
that
he
would
have
stopped
without
emergency
application
in
five
or
six
hundred
feet.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
it
--
it
could.
well,
i
don't
think
the
testimony
of
the
engineer.
i
don't
think
he
was
ever
asked
that
question
whether
or
not
within
200
or
300
feet,
he
could
have
come
to
an
emergency
stop
--
nonemergency
stop.
i
think
the
testimony
was
that
he
had
applied
his
brakes
for
the
normal
station
stop
which
would
have
brought
the
train
to
a
nonemergency
stop
in
500
to
600
feet.
but
that
when
he
saw
the
woman
on
the
track,
after
momentary
hesitation,
he
brought
his
train
to
an
emergency
stop
threw
the
train
into
emergency,
gave
at
the
full
emergency
power
and
that
took
him
about
80
feet
to
bring
his
train
to
the
stop.
and
according
to
his
testimony
and
the
testimony
whether
there
is
only
distance
of
about
40
feet
in
which
he
could
--
between
the
woman
and
the
engine,
affronted
the
engine
when
he
first
saw
her.
now,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
reason
that
--
that
he
may
have
been
as
close
as
12
feet
to
her
before
the
actual
emergency
application
started
taking
place
because
of
the
stop
at
80
feet,
she
was
found
some
60
feet
under
the
--
under
the
locomotive
when
it
came
to
a
stop,
but
the
plaintiff
here
has
argued
that
a
nonemergency
stop
could
have
been
made
in
the
situation
following
out
the
reasoning
that
the
--
well,
the
argument
that
the
plaintiff
makes
here
that
the
engineer
must
have
been
at
least
180
feet
away
rather
than
some
40
feet
away
when
he
saw
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
there
--
there's
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
there's
--
there's
no
evidence
your
honor
that
the
train
could
have
been
stopped
in
that
distance.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
but
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
the
theory
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
was
that
an
emergency
stop
could
have
been
made
sooner
than
it
was
that
even
though
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
it
still
would
have
been
an
emergency
stop.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
and
still
it
would
have
caused
the
physical
injury.
that,
however,
was
not
the
argument
advanced
by
the
plaintiff
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
it
is
not
the
argument
advanced
for
the
plaintiff
here
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i'm
dealing
with
it
in
that
situation,
but
i
would
like
the
deal
with
both
situations
before
i
finish.
but
as
i
say,
the
theory
advanced
consistently
by
the
plaintiff
was
that
the
engineer
could
have
stopped
without
an
emergency.
the
theory
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals
were
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
whether
that
it
couldn't
have
been
brought
to
an
emergency
stop
but
if
the
emergency
stop
could
have
been
attempted
sooner,
there
would
have
been
apparently
no
evidence
or
even
a
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
case
and
the
evidence
was
the
court
of
appeals
refers
to
as
the
momentary
hesitation
on
the
part
of
the
engineer,
which
would
have
not
brought
the
train
to
anything
other
than
an
emergency
stop
at
any
time.
well
now,
getting
on
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
case
before
judge
wyzanski
in
the
district
court,
a
motion
for
directed
verdict
was
presented.
and
judge
wyzanski
denied
the
motion
at
that
time
and
then
further
motion
was
filed,
the
judgment
notwithstanding
with
a
verdict
and
for
a
new
trial
combined
in
the
alternative.
and
at
the
time
the
motion
was
allowed
--
dealt
with,
judge
wyzanski
said
that
he
had
no
authority
even
though
he
felt
there
was
no
negligence
in
the
case
to
directed
verdict
for
the
defendant.
and
he
made
some
rather
specific
comments
which
appear
at
pages
133
and
134
of
the
record
and
page
6
and
7
of
my
brief.
and
on
that,
on
the
second
motion,
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
of
motion
for
new
trial,
he
said,
i
have
endorsed
as
follows,
"this
motion
would
be
granted
by
this
court
if
it
were
free
to
do
so,
but
this
court
construes
the
opinions
and
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
as
giving
him
no
option
but
to
deny
the
motion.
"
and
then
he
went
on
and
made
further
comments
as
to
his
reasons
for
denying
the
motions,
expanding
somewhat
the
formal
endorsement
on
the
motion
itself.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
attempt
to
(inaudible)
amplify
the
reason
given
by
judge
wyzanski
for
denying
the
motion
gave
an
opinion
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
but
it
did
not
reach
the
question
of
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
was
filed
as
i
say
in
the
alternative
relief
motion
notwithstanding
verdict
because
they
said,
"an
appeal
had
not
been
taken
from
that
order
denying
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
"
in
other
words,
an
appeal
was
taken
merely
from
the
judgment.
and
they
never
reached
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
judge,
trial
judge
had
discretion
to
deal
with
the
motion
for
new
trial.
but
in
dealing
with
the
question
on
the
merits,
the
court
as
i
have
indicated
adopted
a
view
different
from
that
argued
by
the
plaintiff
below
as
to
the
theory
of
the
happening
of
the
accident.
the
court
adopted
the
theory
that
on
the
engineer's
testimony,
there
was
a
scintilla
of
evidence
of
negligence
towards
the
woman
on
the
track.
the
court
didn't
actually
discuss
negligence
towards
the
hostess
in
the
dining
car
who
was
injured,
but
the
court
said
the
jury
might
have
found
a
scintilla
of
evidence
towards
to
the
woman
on
the
track
in
that,
the
engineer
might
have
applied
his
brakes
immediately
upon
seeing
him
when
he
was
40
feet
away
instead
of
that
momentary
hesitation
that
he
made
of
seeing
her
go
across
and
then
waiting,
saw
her
turn
around
and
he
was
definitely
convinced
at
that
point
that
she
wasn't
going
to
step
back
and
then
he
put
his
brakes
in
emergency,
i
submit
with
the
same
result
that
he
would
have
had
--
he
had
put
them
on
at
40
feet
rather
than
a
shorter
distance
as
the
court
indicates
that
might
have
been
done.
now,
the
court,
as
i
say,
suggests
that
as
the
scintilla
of
evidence
and
the
court
said,
and
we
submit
that
the
court
has
misapplied
the
rules
adopted
by
this
court.
the
court
said
in
reaching
its
conclusion
that
the
plaintiff
no
longer
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
and
actions
of
negligence
under
the
federal
act
of
leave.
that
only
that
barest
possibility
of
causation
is
enough
to
make
out
a
case
for
the
jury,
that
only
the
mere
scintilla
of
evidence
to
suggest
the
inference
of
any
possible
connection
between
the
engineer's
possibly
negligent,
failure
to
apply
the
brakes
sooner
had
arraigned
down
in
suicide
was
enough
to
take
the
case
to
the
jury.
now,
i
submit
that
the
court
has
misinterpreted
the
opinions
of
this
court
even
though
the
court
there
felt
that
it
was
following
the
opinions
of
this
court.
and
i
believe
that
the
rule
of
the
court
now
or
this
court
now
is
act
laid
down
in
the
rogers
case,
rogers
against
missouri
pacific
352
united
states
and
in
that
case,
the
court
laid
down
the
rule
which
perhaps
i
don't
need
to
reiterate
but
that
was
the
--
the
test
is
whether
the
proofs
justify
with
reason
the
conclusion
that
employer
negligence
played
any
part
even
the
slightest
to
produce
the
injury
or
death
for
which
the
damages
are
sought.
now,
the
proofs
must
justify,
as
i
submit
with
reason
and
with
reason,
i
submit
leave
some
latitude
to
the
judge
in
the
district
court,
the
trial
judge
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
to
the
jury.
now,
judge
wyzanski
clearly
indicated
that
in
his
opinion,
there
was
no
evidence
to
submit
to
the
jury,
no
evidence
of
negligence,
but
felt
that
he
was
bound
to
submit
it
to
the
jury.
and
the
circuit
court
upheld
that
opinion
although
it's
interesting
that
the
circuit
court
did
point
out
that
in
its
opinion,
the
trial
judge
still
does
have
a
function
of
exercising
through
judicial
dis
--
discretion
or
judicial
appraisal
rather
of
the
facts
in
the
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
has
a
question
of
law
an
issue
of
negligence
is
made
out.
but
then
on
the
grounds
given
in
this
case
which
they
gave
indicate
that
it
is
pretty
difficult,
if
not
impossible
to
understand
that
that
court
says
for
any
judge
in
the
court
below
to
give
any
judicial
appraisal
of
--
of
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
to
where
the
finding
of
negligence
if
the
test
which
they
give
is
carried
out.
now,
i
submit
that
the
court,
of
course,
wrote
its
opinion
before
this
court
decided
the
case
inman
against
the
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
company
in
which
i
feel
that
the
court
applied
the
doctrine
of
the
rogers
case
and
the
inman
case.
and
that
this
court
held
that
in
that
particular
case
which
came
up
from
ohio
that
the
court
in
ohio
was
correct
in
resting
a
verdict
for
the
defendant
in
the
case
--
in
that
court
because
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
that
there
was
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
so
i
--
i
submit
that
the
inman
case
definitely
negatives
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
first
circuit
that
there
was
no
further
any
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
prove
negligence
in
the
case.
moreover,
i
think
it
definitely
showed
that
something
more
than
the
mere'
scintilla
of
evidence
in
the
case
that
must
be
shown
in
order
to
make
out
a
case
from
the
jury.
the
court
say
they'll
take
the
position
that
a
scintilla
of
evidence
and
a
scintilla
of
proof,
the
same
thing.
now,
the
--
i
--
i
think
there's
a
distinct
difference
between
the
--
a
scintilla
of
evidence
even
if
the
court
impose
so
far
as
to
say
that
is
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
and
a
scintilla
of
evidence
that
will
make
out
a
case
for
the
jury,
i
don't
think
has
ever
been
by
adopted
by
this
court.
i
think
that
the
court
clearly
dealt
with
a
situation
almost
identical
to
this
in
the
case
of
herdman
against
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
332
massachusetts
518.
and
the
court
recalled
that
that
was
a
case
where
a
sudden
stop
was
made
and
an
engineer
said
that
he
stopped
to
avoid
a
train
at
a
railroad
cross
--
automobile
at
the
railroad
crossing
and
that
the
conductor
who
was
in
the
rear
tire
was
so
much
shaken
up
by
the
sudden
stop
of
the
train.
and
although
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
relied
upon
the
doctrine
of
res
ipsa
loquitur,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
a
significant
differ
--
difference
between
that
case
and
this
case
because
even
if
the
method
of
proof
is
different
from
that
case
and
this
case,
the
facts
in
both
cases
had
clearly
indicated
the
circumstances
of
the
stop
in
both
cases
fully
appear.
and
the
burden
which
the
plaintiff
had
sustained
was
a
proof
of
negligence
and
the
court
held
in
the
herdman
case
that
the
proof
had
not
been
sustained
and
i
submit
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
specific
negligence,
yes
sir.
but
i
--
i
submit
that
whether
its
res
ipsa
or
rather
specific
negligence,
the
burden
of
proof
has
to
be
sustained
by
the
plaintiff
and
that
the
burden
of
proving
negligence
was
not
sustained
in
this
case
and
that
the
burden
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
yes,
sir.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
and
that
the
burden
still
is
on
the
plaintiff.
that's
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
i
think
--
i
think
perhaps,
i've
got
to
proceed
to
that
your
honor.
now,
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
suggested,
there
is
an
interesting
procedural
question
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals,
although
the
question
was
before
it
and
was
fully
briefed
and
argued
merely
ended
up
by
saying
that
the
question
was
not
before
it
and
it
did
not
have
to
consider
it,
because
no
appeal
had
been
taken
from
the
order
on
the
motion
for
new
trial.
now,
the
respondent
here
says
that
no
motion
--
there's
nothing
through
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
anyway,
because
it
was
waived
at
the
time
of
trial
and
of
course,
that
isn't
so
and
i
don't
think
i'll
even
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
arguing
it.
judge
wyzanski
indicated
almost
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
of
what
he
was
going
to
do
in
the
case
and
i
reached
a
certain
point
in
the
argument
and
he
had
said,
"i'm
not
going
to
help
you
any
here
but
i
may
help
you
later
on,”
or
words
to
that
effect
and
i
said,
"well,
apparently
in
view
of
that,
there
is
no
use
for
me
to
continue
this
argument
any
further.
"
now,
mr.
kelleher,
in
his
brief
said
that
amounts
to
waiver
but
i
submit
that
nothing
was
further
from
my
intention,
i
think
the
judge
didn't
consider
it.
i'm
sure
the
judge
didn't
consider
it
as
any
kind
of
waiver.
and
further,
it
has
been
suggested
in
the
other
brief
that
some
exception
or
objection
of
--
should've
been
taken
at
that
time
and
that
that
had
--
not
having
been
done
there
was
a
further
waiver,
but
getting
away
from
the
technical
points
that
have
been
raised
in
that
connection,
i
will
try
to
argue
the
question
on
the
merits
as
to
the
necessity
or
lack
of
necessity
or
taking
a
second
appeal,
an
appeal
from
an
order
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
in
addition
to
the
appeal,
the
judge
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that
--
that's
--
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
well
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
in
--
let
--
let
me
--
let
me
say
this,
your
honor.
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
take
the
position
that
there
was
another
question
here
on
substance
that
--
that
the
first
motion
should
not
have
been
allowed,
but
i
say
this
that
if
the
first
motion
should
not
have
been
allowed
if
the
court
so
finds
as
a
matter
of
law
by
then
i
submit
that
the
trial
judge
had
a
right
and
perhaps
a
duty
to
act
upon
the
new
trial
of
motion.
but
as
i
take
the
position
that
the
trial
judge
took
was
that
he
had
no
more
power
on
that
motion
than
he
had
on
the
other
motion,
and
that
they
both
were
thrown
in
the
package
and
denied
together.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
relying
upon
some
of
the
cases
in
the
first
circuit,
which
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
indicated
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
taking
an
appeal
from
the
second
--
from
the
order
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
or
the
denial
of
the
motion
for
new
trial.
and
it's
interesting
to
know
that
in
certain
hardship
cases
in
the
first
circuit
and
i
think
there
maybe
some
another
circuits
where
the
time
of
appeal
has
expired
on
the
motion
for
judgment
that
the
motion
--
on
the
--
on
the
judgment
itself
that
the
courts
have
permitted
but
have
not
required
up
to
this
point,
an
appeal
from
the
order
on
the
post
judgment
motion.
now,
the
cases
which
i
cite
here,
i
think
indicate
that
most
of
the
cases,
i
have
pointed
them
out
on
page
24,
there
are
several
cases
from
the
--
had
a
--
and
where
i
see
it
appears
that
an
order
to
permit
appeal
in
certain
cases
where
the
appellant
had
lost
the
rights
from
appeal
from
the
judgment,
citing
avalon
against
zismann
or
had
mistaken
his
remedy.
united
states
against
petz
and
there's
a
footnote
there
which
is
very
interesting
in
that
case
in
which
the
court
says
that,
"probably,
the
proper
method
should
have
been
to
have
appeal
from
the
judgment
that
says
an
appeal
wasn't
taken
from
the
judgment
from
the
state
of
new
order.
they're
going
to
plead
that
there's
an
appeal
properly
taken
and
it's
so
treated.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that's
right.
it
--
it
covers
the
--
the
judgment.
it
covers
the
entire
situation.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
and
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
why
--
why
the
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
why
--
why
the
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
it
--
it
was
argued,
i
think
to
them
by
the
plaintiff
below
at
the
time
that
it
should've
been
a
separate
appeal.
i
--
i
didn't
argue
with
that
at
the
time
because
i
--
i
consider
that
i've
taken
a
proper
appeal
from
the
judgment
and
was
brought
up
at
that
time
before
them.
and
i
think
i
merely
argued
it
incidentally
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
more
or
less
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
that
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that's
right.
he
sees
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that
is
there
were
two
separate
motions
even
though
combined
in
the
same
motion.
i
think
their
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
don't
remember
it,
sir.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
i
don't
remember
that.
i
--
i
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
well,
of
course
--
of
course
that
--
that
is
true.
i
think
there
--
i
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i
--
and
i
haven't
--
didn't
find
that
particular
case,
your
honor,
but
of
course,
i
think
some
of
the
district
--
circuit
court
cases
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
indicate
the
same
thing
that
there
actual
--
absolutely
--
two
absolutely
different
things.
one,
motion
that
judge
passes
on
as
a
matter
of
law
and
the
other
one
still
has
a
discretion
on
a
motion
for
new
trial.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
points
out,
apparently
at
the
end
of
its
argument
saying
whether
or
not
the
--
well,
i
think
the
--
to
say
they
have
the
question
of
whether
the
court
below
might
properly
have
granted
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
in
the
hope
that
another
jury
might
return
a
verdict,
more
in
keeping
with
the
great
weight
of
the
evidence
is
not
before
us.
the
--
the
defendant
did
not
appeal
from
the
denial
to
the
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
from
the
judgment.
that
--
that's
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that's
exactly
the
position
that
i
am
taking
that
the
--
that
the
--
in
the
appeal
from
--
from
the
judgment
is
the
only
appeal
that
pro
--
properly
could
have
been
taken
here
because
this
action
on
the
motion
for
new
trial
is
encompassed
within
the
judgment.
the
judgment
is
--
is
in
abeyance
actually
until
that
motion
for
a
new
trial
has
disposed
off.
when
it
is
disposed
off,
by
then
of
course,
the
time
starts
to
run
under
the
rule
and
any
appeal
from
the
judgment,
i
submit,
is
a
proper
appeal.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
as
the
final
order
in
the
case.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
and
that
is
what
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that's
right.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
that's
right.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
i
submit
your
honor
that
that's
exactly
what
he
could
do,
that
is
supposing,
he
had
taken
the
position
that
he
did
as
a
matter
of
law,
i
have
no
authority
to
allow
the
motion
nov,
yet
i
feel
that
there's
been
a
miscarriage
of
justice
in
this
case.
mr.
noel
w.
deering
yes,
i
--
i
--
mr.
noel
w.
deering
i
--
i
submit
that
that
is
so
your
honor.
mr.
noel
w.

i'm
sorry
too,
sir.
