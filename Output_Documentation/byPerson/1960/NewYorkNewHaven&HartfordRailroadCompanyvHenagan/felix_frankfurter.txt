this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
beg
your
pardon,
no,
go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
just
going
to
ask
whether
you're
going
to
leave
yourself
room
to
discuss
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
judgment
of
the
motion
for
new
trial
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
and
all
that's
involved
in
that
particular
clause.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
would
be
the
argument
of
course
presupposes
that
although
he
--
it
might
not
be
a
case
for
nov.
it
might
be
a
case
for
a
motion
for
granting
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
assume
that
or
are
you
going
to
say
anything
about
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
fela
cases.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you're
arguing
that
the
judgment
brings
up
a
motion
for
new
trial
or
is
that
incidental
part
of
the
judgment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
mind
telling
me
--
would
you
mind
explaining
why
two
such
experience,
appellate
judges
or
judge
woofgrain
and
judge
hartigan
and
called
first
the
trial
lawyers
as
judge
aldrich
who
should've
--
who
rendered
this
decision
at
the
motion
for
new
trial
required
a
separate
appeal?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
just
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
(voice
overlap)
puzzled.
i'm
puzzled.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you're
arguing
here
that
although
judge
wyzanski
might
have
been
right
in
denying
nov,
he
should've
entertained
the
motion
for
new
trial
as
it
--
that
they
weren't
able
to
hide,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
a
different
(inaudible),
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
now,
what
do
you
do
with
the
case
of
deen
against
hickman
in
this
court,
remember
that
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
358,
a
case
coming
up
from
texas.
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
you
say
ordinarily,
a
motion
for
new
trial
is
raisable.
it's
properly
to
be
put
to
trial
judge
and
he
may
find
that
he
couldn't
upset
the
jury's
verdict
but
nevertheless
on
considering
the
whole
evidence,
you
may
find
the
--
that
that
would
be
another
go
at
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
that
true
enough
in
the
fela
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
as
you
point
out,
the
cases
of
the
first
circuit
where
for
one
reason
or
another,
the
judgment
is
not
appealable.
they
use
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
as
peg
on
which
to
hang
an
appeal
of
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
on
the
generality
is
it
--
or
the
generality
of
the
rule
as
justice
whittaker
has
indicated,
it
is
what
it
is.
those
cases
are
very
different
from
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
far
as
that's
the
way
of
doing
just
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
the
rule,
whether
in
fela
case,
you
are
contending
as
you
must
that
although
there's
enough
to
make
the
judge
put
the
case
to
the
jury
and
if
there's
enough
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury,
he
can't
take
the
verdict
away
from
the
jury,
he
may
take
the
verdict
away
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
justice
felix
frankfurter
although
--
although
there
was
enough
to
go
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
was
entitled
according
to
rogers
to
give
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiff.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
nevertheless,
take
away
to
the
verdict
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
that's
your
position.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
sorry
you
didn't
look
at
deen
against
hickman.
