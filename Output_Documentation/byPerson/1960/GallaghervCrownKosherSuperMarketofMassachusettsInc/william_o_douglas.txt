justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
the
fact
that
it
was
a
kosher
market,
rather
than
some
other
market
and
relevant
here
to
the
issues?
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
--
your
position
is
about
what
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
took
in
that
1877
decision
(inaudible)
justice
william
o.
douglas
you're
referring
now
to
the
previous
criminal
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
mean
they
should
have
come
here
by
certiorari
from
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
i
didn't
think
this
fourth
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
question
was
raised
in
the
--
in
the
state
litigation,
was
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
different
if
the
market
was
run
by
an
atheist?
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
--
on
the
equal
protection,
i
would
think
that
the
argument
would
be
the
same
if
you're
--
if
you're
relying
on
the
equal
protection.
