justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this.
does
the
statute
itself,
treat
this
as
a
religious
holiday
or
just
a
legal
holiday?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
it?
what
--
what
is
its
present
form?
where
is
that
i
mean,
in
your
brief
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
beginning
at
page
80?
justice
hugo
l.
black
97.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
the
old
statute,
which
was
printed
on
page
80
aided
--
aided
and
supplanted
by
this
new
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
statute
printed
on
page
80
of
your
appendix
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
been
supplanted
by
a
new
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
says
--
does
it
say,
lords
day,
definition?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
the
--
have
the
amendments
that
have
been
passed
have
changed
this
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
change
the
language
in
the
second
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
change
the
language?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
does
the
law
in
effect
now,
in
section
two,
contain
this
statement
about
the
presence
of
games
and
so
forth
on
the
lords
day?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
trying
to
get
what
--
what
it
is
we
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
want
to
follow
the
sunday
laws
we
have,
are
written
in
that
form.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
friedman
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
the
express
purpose
of
a
statute
could
make
any
difference
in
connection
with
its
constitutionality
in
this
respect?
suppose
the
statute
says,
one
because
a
christian
church
observes
this
day
as
a
religious
festival
and
we
are
incorporating
that
and
make
it
a
--
a
holiday
because
of
that
fact,
do
you
think
that
would
change
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
investigated
to
see
whether
there
are
any
other
religions
that
observe
other
days
of
the
week
as
a
religious
festival?
justice
hugo
l.
black
besides
saturday
and
sunday?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
live
in
this
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
day
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
a
day
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
the
week
or
something?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
--
are
you
arguing
--
are
you
arguing
res
judicata
or
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
right
or
standing
to
bring
this
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
suggest,
it
seems
to
me
like
that
there
--
a
mere
fact
that
he's
been
charged
with
something
criminal,
be
all
the
more
reason,
why
he'd
hope
he
has
a
chance
--
have
a
chance
to
attack
its
constitutionality.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
shows
that
he's
good
--
greatly
affected
by
it,
one
way
or
the
other
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
that
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
you
are
claiming,
he's
a
collateral
estoppel,
i
suppose
or
res
judicata.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
join
in
the
suggestion
made
by
one
of
my
brethren
that,
if
you
will,
you
go
ahead
into
the
merits,
because
i
think,
you
presented
this
pretty
well.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
i
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
we're
going
to
have
to
reach
the
merits
on
some
of
these
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
personally,
would
like
to
hear
you
argue
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
to
me,
because
i'd
rather
think
they
have
standing,
i
must
say,
that
i
can't
see
why
there
wasn't
outstanding.
i
just
can't
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
the
merits.
that's
--
i'm
just
speaking
for
one
person.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
indicate
there's
no
difference
between
clams
and
oysters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
seems
to
me
(inaudible)
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
cases
have
we
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
about
that,
since
you're
discussing
that
case.
i
--
what
significance
it
has,
i
do
not
know,
but
i
have
the
record
before
me
in
which
they
cited
it
being
enforced
at
that
time.
the
section
which
says
it
is
sufficient
defense
for
a
prosecution
for
work
or
labor
on
the
first
day
of
the
week
that
the
defendant
uniformly
keeps
another
day
of
the
week
as
holy
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
such
provision
as
that
in
your
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
the
same
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
cited
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
--
why
was
this
man
prosecuted?
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
he
charged
in
this
--
in
this
case
against
him,
was
he
charged
for
selling
kosher
meats
on
a
sabbath?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
effect
would
this
have
on
the
seventh-day
adventist,
this
particular
section?
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
if
all
they
were
selling
were
some,
take
the
kosher
meat,
all
they
were
selling
was
kosher
meat?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
should
a
merchant
make
it
except
from
an
open?
i
don't
--
know
their
significant,
but
how
can
he
make
it
except
on
the
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
answer
then
is
that
he
can
serve
kosher
meat
up
to
noon
but
not
after
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
what
it's
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
answering
justice
douglas,
you
made
one
statement
that
i
want
to
have
you
see
if
i
understood
it.
you
said,
assuming
that
a
state,
i
thought
you
said,
assuming
that
a
state
can
within
its
police
power,
fix
any
day
of
the
week
as
a
day
of
rest,
which
i
do
not
believe
i
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
in
a
way
you
might
mention
out
if
--
if
not
one
day,
how
--
how
another,
it
might
conflict
with
somebody's
religion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
do
take
the
position
do
you
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
fix
a
day
of
rest
merely
because
it
wants
to
fix
a
day
of
rest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
think
it
would
have
to
go
that
far
in
order
to
have
one?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
are
arguing
that
on
--
wholly
on
the
assumption
that
it
is
a
religious
statute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
the
other
side
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
the
other
side
to
argue
that
the
supreme
court
has
said
it
is
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
your
argument
be
different
if
--
if
there
was
nothing
here
shown,
nothing
in
the
cases
that
showed
the
motive
or
the
purpose
of
the
passing
of
the
act?
and
do
we
have
a
right
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
we
have
a
right
to
consider
the
motive
and
purpose
of
the
legislature
advisement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
would
have
pass
--
suppose
it
could
be
held
unconstitutional
and
they
passed
one
the
next
week
and
said
this
is
wholly
because
we
desire
to
have
a
day
of
rest
and
put
it
either
on
a
sunday
or
saturday.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
about
an
act
on
its
face.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
consider,
do
we
not,
what
is
the
effect
of
what
we
hold
with
reference
to
the
power
of
a
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
the
field.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
i
understand
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
saying
i
disagree
with
it.
all
i'm
asking
is,
would
we
have
a
different
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
did
not
show
what
the
purpose
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
on
that
point
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
--
on
that
point,
i
want
to
ask
you
one
other
question.
since
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
had
said
that
this
is
a
day
of
rest
and
construes
it
as
being
for
that
and
as
not
being
a
religious
statute,
can
we
ignore
that
or
are
we
bound
by
what
they
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
has
case,
which
was
recently
decided
with
approval
in
the
chernock
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
expressly
held
that
they
construed
it
in
that
fashion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
some
ways,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
--
it
reads
like
one
to
me,
but
the
court
has
said
it's
not
and
that's
the
problem
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
have
to
answer
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
or
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
or
not
the
description
of
it
by
a
state
supreme
court
has
one,
is
binding
on
us.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
its
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
or
if
not,
what
effect
should
we
give
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
we
are
--
we
are
not
bound
by
this
construction
of
the
three-judge
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
are
bound
by
an
interpretation,
if
it
is
an
interpretation
and
if
it's
one
way
or
another,
by
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
supreme
court
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
merely
decide
these
cases
in
constitutional
form,
the
basis
of
this
particular
language
and
haven't
construed
it
right
as
to
its
meaning,
leave
it
where
the
state
can
by
saying,
we're
going
to
have
a
day
of
rest
and
we
pass
it.
we
haven't
made
a
very
far
reaching
and
maybe
we
shouldn't,
constitutional
decision,
have
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
agree
to
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
unusual,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
some
people
like
to
get
up
early?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
it
would
be
permitted
on
the
saturday,
it
would
still
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
a
religious
question.
