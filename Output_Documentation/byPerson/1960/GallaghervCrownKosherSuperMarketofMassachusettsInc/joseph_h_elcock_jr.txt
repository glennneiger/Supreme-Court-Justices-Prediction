mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
court
for
the
district
for
the
first
district,
relating
to
the
sunday
laws
of
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
so
called.
the
proceeding
was
held
in
the
district
court
for
massachusetts
as
a
result
of
a
hearing
and
a
decree.
a
decision
of
the
court
was
rendered
by
two
members
of
the
court
and
a
majority
--
a
majority
decision
entered
by
the
court
and
a
minority
opinion
by
justice
mccarthy.
as
far
as
the
proceedings
before
the
district
court
are
concerned,
a
complaint
was
filed
by
the
petitioners
alleging,
in
effect,
that
they
conducted
a
kosher
super
market
in
springfield,
massachusetts,
at
which
kosher
super
market,
they
sold
foods
which
had
been
approved
by
the
rabbi,
that
they
sold
those
foods
for
purposes
of
satisfying
the
religious
requirements
of
the
various
customers
of
that
particular
store,
that
they
held
their
store
closed
from
sundown
on
friday
through
saturday
and
that
they
opened
their
store
on
sunday.
basically,
the
violation
that
was
involved
here
related
to
the
sale
of
foods
by
that
kosher
super
market
on
sunday.
there
were
three
cases
initially
in
the
massachusetts
supreme
court
against
the
manager
of
that
market
and
as
a
result
of
convictions
in
those
three
cases,
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
was
brought
in
the
district
court
prior
referred
to.
as
far
as
the--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
to
us,
your
honor,
it
has
no
relevance
in
the
sense
that
this
is
a
super
market.
it
sells--
the
evidence
will
show
that
it
sells
foods
which
were
approved
by
the
rabbi.
it
will
also
show
that
they
sold
foods
which
were
not
necessarily
kosher
foods.
to
that
extent,
they
went
beyond
what
may
well
have
been
the
requirements
of
a
kosher
super
market
in
the
sense
of
selling
only
foods.
it
will
become
significant
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
complainants,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
they
claim
that
in
order
to
satisfy
the
religious
requirements
of
their
customers,
it
is
necessary
that
they
be
able
to
make
sales
on
sunday.
to
that
extent,
from
their
viewpoint,
it
does
have
a
religious
connotation
in
the
sense
that
they
claim
that
not
by
being
prohibited
from
making
any
sales
on
sunday
that
the
religious
rights
of
their
customers
are
disturbed,
as
well
as
the
religious
rights
of
the
officers
and
directors
and
stockholders
of
this
particular
corporation.
there
were
allegations
and
it
has
been
admitted
that
the
stockholders,
the
directors
and
the
officers
of
this
crown
kosher
super
market
were,
in
effect,
obliged
by
the
tenants
of
their
religious
beliefs
to
remain
closed
during
those
hours
that
i
have
referred
to,
that
is
from
sundown
on
friday
night
through
saturday,
through,
at
least
until
sundown
on
saturday.
thereafter,
of
course,
they
would
be
allowed
to
open.
so,
we
would
say
that,
from
our
viewpoint,
your
honor,
it
is
not
significant
or
should
not
be
significant
that
there
is
a
religious
connotation
to
at
least
some
of
the
sales
made
by
the
crown
kosher
super
market.
on
the
other
hand
your
honor,
as
i
say,
the
gravamen
of
the
action
would
be,
as
far
as
i'm
able
to
determine
from
the
complaint,
that
the
very
fact
that
the
massachusetts
statute
here,
obliges
them
to
close
on
sunday,
interferes
with
their
religious
rights
and
they
go
one
step
further
because
the
massachusetts
statutes,
as
they
alleged
and
which,
of
course,
is
the
knife
from
my
viewpoint,
because
the
massachusetts
statute
is
predicated
upon
what
they
believed
to
be
a
religious
ground,
they
then
say
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
that
their
religious
rights
are
disturbed.
of
course,
your
honor,
you're
going
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
it
would
be
on
this
basis.
ordinary
markets
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
may
open
six
days
a
week
and
they
are
required
to
close
on
--
on
sunday.
they
contend
that
they
are
obliged
to
close
on
sunday
because
of
the
statute
and
because
of
their
religious
beliefs
they
are
obliged
to
close
on
saturday.
thus
it
is
argued,
they
are
obliged
to
remain
closed
two
days
in
the
week,
whereas,
the
ordinary
market
in
a
similar
position,
would
be
allowed
to
--
would
be
obliged
to
be
closed
on
only
one
day
of
the
week.
so
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
it
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
is
the
point
that
they
are
taking.
that
there
is
an
economic
loss
to
them
and
that
they
are
obliged
to
forego
the
right
to
carry-on
business
on
one
extra
day
of
the
week
and
because
of
the
fact
that
they
forego
it
to
their
religious
beliefs
and
because
of
the
fact
that
the
sunday
closing,
according
to
them,
is
similarly
predicated
upon
religious
grounds,
they
then
say
that
a
religious
law
has
put
them
in
a
position
where
their
economic
rights
are
disturbed.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
believe
your
honor,
they
would.
they
would
say
that
because
of
the
preference
that
may
be
given
to
persons
who
are
not
of
their
persuasion
would
put
them
in
a
position
where
others
might
feel
that
they
shouldn't
perhaps,
be
bound
by
the
tenants
of
that
religious
state.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
that's
--
that's
the
other
side
of
the
argument.
of
course,
as
we
will
point
out
in
the
course
of
our
argument
your
honor,
the
commonwealth
imposes
limitations
on
sunday
and
for
no
state
action
whatsoever,
are
these
people
closed
on
saturday,
nor
are
they
closed
on
friday.
so
that,
we
would
say
that
everyone
is
subject
to
the
sunday
law
and
assuming
the
sunday
law
is
a
valid
one,
the
mere
fact
that
it
would
have
an
indirect
effect
upon
their
religious
rights
would
not
in
and
of
itself,
make
the
sunday
law
invalid.
there
are
many
instances,
i
would
assume
that
would
more
or
less,
indicate
that
approach.
we
have
certainly
requirements
that
students,
for
example,
shall
attend
schools.
we
have
obligations
upon
the
parents
to
support
schools,
say
to
support
the
public
schools
yet
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
some
parents,
perhaps
because
of
their
religious
beliefs,
also
would
support
another
school
system
such
as
a
parochial
school
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
economic
detriment
on
one
religious
group
or
another,
that
per
se,
your
honors,
we
feel
would
not
be
a
sufficient
ground
under
these
particular
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
perhaps,
i
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
they
would
say
that
and
i
intend
that
your
honors,
perhaps
to
fill
a
little
more
detail,
but
since
the
issue
was
really
just
in
what
you
say,
let
me
direct
my
attention
to
that
point.
we
do
have
a
statute
of
massachusetts
that
requires
closing
on
sunday.
and
one
of
the
basic
arguments
of
the
complainants
in
this
case,
is
that
that
statute
is
a
religious
one
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
impose
an
obligation
on
the
states
to
refrain
from
passing
any
statute
of
that
nature.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
it
is
our
contention
that
today,
in
its
present
form
it
treats
it
more
like
in
the
nature
of
a
legal
holiday.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
your
honor
it's
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
appendix
a
in
detail
and
the
statute
is
fairly
broad.
section
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
in
the
brief,
it's
at
page
97.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
and
it's
fairly
long
statute,
your
honor.
it
covers
several
pages
in
the
brief
here.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
--
i
missed
that
question.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
that
--
that's
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
this
is
the
statute,
on
page
80,
following
through
to
97.
i
--
i
perhaps
gave
the
wrong
reference.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
one.
the
lords
day
shall
include
the
time
from
midnight
to
midnight
and
to
the
extent
that
the
word,
“lords
day”
is
in
the
statute
to
that
extent,
my
brothers
likewise,
would
claim
that
therefore,
it
is
a
religious
statute.
but
we
would
say,
your
honor,
that
this
statute
has
perhaps,
a
history
which
would
show
that
religion
initially,
may
have
had
some
part
in
determining
the
very
fact
that
this
statute
was
put
on
the
books.
we
would
say,
your
honor,
that
because
of
the
passage
of
time
and
the
amendments
to
the
statute,
it
now
takes
on
a
connotation
which
is
no
longer
a
religious
one,
but
it
is
one
whereby
sunday
is
set
aside
in
massachusetts
as
a
day
of
rest
and
recreation.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
they
haven't
changed
the
language
in
that
first
section,
your
honor,
where
the
lords
day
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
in
essence,
yes.
these
sections
two,
three
and
four
have
been
passed
at
a
time
subsequent
to
the
initial
enactment.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
the
initial
lords
day
statute,
your
honor,
did
not
have
section
two
in
it.
the
language
which
was
there
put
in,
was
put
in
as
an
amendment
after
the
initial
statute
of
massachusetts,
back
in
colonial
days,
was
enacted.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
it
does.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
when
you
have
the
very
statute
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
most,
but
not
all.
one,
perhaps
that
has
been
before
this
court
most
recently,
is
that
involved
in
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
friedman
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
and
in
that
new
york
statute,
again,
we
have
the
same
kind
of
language.
in
section
2140
of
it,
you'll
find
that
statute,
your
honor,
incidentally,
in
the
--
in
the
records
in
detail
of
the
friedman
case
which
was
up
here
on
appeal,
you'll
find
it
referred
to
in
the
briefs
of
the
various
parties
but,
in
that
new
york
statute,
your
honor,
it
specifically
indicates
that
the
violation
of
this
particular
statute
is
sabbath
breaking
and
it
provides
that
the
breaking
of
the
law
here
would
constitute
a
serious
interruption
of
the
repose
and
religious
liberty
of
the
community.
now
that,
your
honor,
was
in
the
new
york
case,
when
that
matter
was
appealed
to
this
court.
it
was
dismissed
without
hearing
on
the
ground
that
no
federal
question
was
involved
and
if
one
looks
at
the
decision
of
the
state
supreme
court
in
that
matter,
which
was
the
one
i
would
assume
that
this
court
examined
in
deciding
to
dismiss
the
case,
it
will
appear
that
this
very
question
of
religion
was
discussed.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
will
also
appear
that
in
the
new
york
courts,
it
had
been
determined
that
although
initially,
this
statute
in
new
york
may
have
had
a
religious
significance
that
as
a
result
of
the
various
amendments
to
it,
it
no
longer
was
for
the
purpose
of
preferring
one
religion
to
another,
establishing
one
religion
or
what
have
you,
as
far
as
religious
base
is
concerned.
and
the
mere
fact
that
the
word,
"sabbath"
was
in
there,
as
far
as
i'm
able
to
determine,
was
not
persuasive
upon
this
court
of
the
fact
that
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
parties
in
that
particular
case
had
been
injured.
now,
we
have,
your
honor,
a
statute
almost
identical
with
it.
i
cannot
say,
word-for-word
it
is
identical,
but
it
is
highly
similar
in
the
sense
that
instead
of
talking
about
the
sabbath,
massachusetts
talks
about
the
word,
“lords
day.”
we
have
all
kinds
of
--
of
limitations
and
exceptions
in
our
statute,
just
as
they
did
right
here
in
--
in
new
york.
so
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
one
of
the
very
cases
which
has
been
up
here
for
determination
by
this
court,
had
in
it
the
very
elements
that
are
in
this
massachusetts
statute.
so
we
would
say,
although
we
have
not
printed
in
detail
in
our
brief
the
statutes
from
all
the
other
states,
a
good
percentage
of
them
do.
and
in
appendix
b
to
our
brief,
your
honor,
we
have
made
reference
to
most
of
those
statutes
and
to
all
of
the
cases
which
--
all
the
significant
cases,
which
have
been
decided
under
them.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
it
would
for
this
reason.
basically,
we
are
here,
dealing
with
a
statute
which
provides
for
one
day
of
rest
out
of
seven,
something
like
a
wages
and
hour
law
and
if
it
turned
out
that
the
best
day
to
pick
for
that
purpose
was
one
already
observed
by
the
great
number
of
people
in
the
united
states
or
in
the
commonwealth,
then
for
purposes
of
achieving
a
day
of
rest,
it
would
be
highly
desirable
to
pick
one
already
observed
by
the
people
as
a
result
of
custom
and
uses.
now,
if
it
--
once
it
is
admitted
and
i
don't
believe
it's
actually
denied
that
a
state
may
enact
one
day
as
a
day
of
rest,
then
the
mere
fact
that
they
might
pick
out
a
day
where
other
people
would
or
some
of
the
people
would
be
observing
it
for
persons
or
reasons
of
a
religious
nature,
does
not
in
and
of
itself,
make
the
statute
invalid.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
we
didn't
go
into
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
as
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
not
in
our
brief,
but
i
--
i
did
find
reference
in
some
articles,
your
honor,
indicating
that
some
buddhist,
for
example,
might
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
use
tuesday
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
out
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
tuesday.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
as
i
understand
it.
now,
i'm
speaking
here,
your
honor,
perhaps
of
--
of
memory.
we
do
not
have
it
in
the
brief
as
such,
but
this
very
point
that
you're
raising,
i
think
would
more
or
less,
indicate
the
difficulties
that
we'd
run
into.
let's
assume
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
a
state
determination
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
commonwealth
v.
has,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
examined
at
some
detail,
which
says
that,
although
the
statute
may
initially
have
had
a
religious
background,
it
now
and
this
is
as
of
the
middle
of
the
1800s,
is
a
statute
setting
up
one
day
of
rest
in
the
community.
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
may
have
had
a
religious
history
does
not
make
it
valid
--
invalid
as
such.
i
would
point
out,
your
honor,
that
the
--
when
this
statute
initially
started,
it
didn't
just
prohibit
people
from
opening
shop
on
sunday.
this
statute
obliged
people
to
attend
services
and
to
that
extent,
the
initial
history
of
the
statute
in
colonial
days,
would
indicate
that
there
was
a
religious
basis
to
it.
i
think
it
--
it's
fundamental
that
many
of
the
colonies
when
--
when
set
up,
were
set
up
because
of
religious
grounds
and
we
can't
deny
the
history
of
our
country
and
say
that
there
was
no
religious
basis
in
some
of
the
statutes
which
they
enacted.
but
through
the
passage
of
time,
the
adoption
of
the
constitution,
the
changes
which
have
been
made
in
the
statute
itself,
one
which
at
that
time,
served
the
needs
of
the
community
from
a
religious
viewpoint,
has
been
the
vehicle
whereby,
today,
one
day
of
rest
is
set
aside
out
of
seven
so
that,
instead
of
--
of
people
being
oppressed
and
having
to
work
because
of
the
pressure
of
competition,
they
are
now
able
to
take
that
one
particular
day
and
spend
it
with
their
families
and
what
have
you.
now,
i
believe,
your
honors
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
any
statute,
whether
we
picked
--
whether
it
picked
sunday
or
any
other
day,
would
have
an
indirect
effect
upon
the
rights
of
some
individuals
who
would
--
would
desire
to
remain
open
on
the
particular
day
selected.
as
such,
there
will
be
a
--
an
economic
pressure
on
i
would
say,
some
group,
no
matter
what
day
was
picked.
on
that
ground,
your
honor,
let's
say
that
we
picked
saturday
instead
of
sunday,
then
i
can
foresee
without
too
much
difficulty
that
christians
or
persons
who
would
observe
sunday,
would
have
the
same
complaint
against
the
statute
as
the
jewish
people
would
have
in
connection
with
this
one
or
that
group
of
--
of
christians
who
would
observe
saturday
as
the
sabbath,
so
that
it
doesn't
answer
the
problem
to
say
we
may
change
from
saturday
--
from
sunday
to
saturday.
again,
your
honors,
if
we
pick
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
we
have
one.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
we
certainly
do,
your
honor
and
i
think
it's
vital
as
a
supplement
to
our
sunday
statute.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
would.
if
we
had
a
seventh
--
one
in
seven,
it
would
not,
but
look
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
we
do
in
chapter
one
hundred
and
forty-nine,
your
honor,
but
here's
the
difficulty,
if
we
picked
one
day
in
seven,
one
man
will
pick
monday,
another
tuesday,
another
wednesday.
as
far
as
that
is
concerned,
a
wife
who
might
be
working
and
a
husband
who
would
be
working
would
necessarily
take
the
same
day.
the
children
would
be
off
at
school,
that
kind
of
thing.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
we--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
let
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
let's
assume
--
assume,
your
honor
that
you
are
correct
that
there
is
no
absolute
requirement
that
this
take
place.
here,
we
have
a
question
of
discretion
as
far
as
the
legislature
of
a
state
is
concerned
and
it
is
a
problem
then
of
whether
the
legislature
in
the
proper
exercise
of
its
discretion,
does
have
a
right
to
pick
out
one
day.
now,
you
or
i
or
any
other
person
may
say,
that
is
undesirable
from
a
legislative
viewpoint.
is
it
unconstitutional?
that's
the
question
here.
as
such,
we
would
say,
it
is
not.
now,
many
of
us
may
disagree
with
a
particular
day.
many
of
us
may
disagree
with
the
fact
that
there's
not
one
day
in
--
in
seven
that
you
do,
rather
than
pick
out
the
particular
day.
but,
if
the
legislature
in
the
proper
exercise
of
its
discretion,
has
selected
this
one
particular
day,
then
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
for
a
court
to
say
that
the
legislature
has
acted
improperly.
there
is
one
other
point
on
this.
as
far
as
this
massachusetts
statute
is
concerned,
there
are
many
exceptions
to
it,
your
honor,
whereby
people
may
stay
open
on
sunday.
in
the
brief,
we
have
spelled
out
that
--
the
exceptions
to
it
and
of
course,
the
statute
is
set
forth
in
here.
people,
for
example,
running
roadside
stands,
if
you
happen
to
be
driving
a
car,
you
could
stop,
people
running
certain
amusement
areas,
people
conducting
businesses
which
would
be
essential
for
the
carrying
on
of
--
of
life
today,
transportation,
fuel,
necessary,
things
of
that
sort,
all
of
those
people
would
be
in
a
category
where
they
could
be
called
upon
to
work
without
violating
this
particular
statute.
now,
if
those
people
who
have
to
work
on
sunday
are
to
be
given
the
benefit
of
one
day
off,
anyway
and
they
can't
take
sunday,
fairly
clearly,
it
would
be
up
to
the
commonwealth
in
its
discretion
to
pick
out
some
other
day
and
thus,
it
is
said
that,
where
we
run
into
a
situation
where
people
might
be
working
on
sunday,
an
employer
cannot
insist
that
thereafter,
they
work
the
other
six
days.
to
that
extent,
i
would
say
that
our
statute
saying
that
you
cannot
have
seven
consecutive
days,
is
a
necessary
adjunct
to
our
sunday
law,
so-called,
which
in
effect
says,
“everybody
closes
on
sunday
except”
the
people
that
then
have
to
work
on
sunday
are
given
the
benefit
of
this
other
day
which
may
be
available.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no
and
we
have
many
people,
your
honor,
who
do
just
exactly
that.
there's
no
particular
penalty
under
that
statute
which
would
say
that
if
an
individual
himself,
works
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
an
obligation
which
is
or
a
--
a
restraint
which
seems
to
have
placed
upon
the
employer,
whereby
he
himself,
would
be
subjected
to
a
--
a
criminal
violation,
if
he
forced
a
man
to
work
or
a
woman
to
work
for
the
full
seven
consecutive
days.
i
have
departed
somewhat
from
the
facts,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
perhaps,
would
not
achieve
a
tremendous
amount
to
go
through
it
in
detail
as
such.
you
have
suggested
here
that
the
basic
issue
is
that
of
this
sunday
law
and
i
think,
if
they
have
answered
that
particular
question,
i
would
like
to
proceed
just
a
little
bit
with
the
argument
further
along
those
lines.
the
facts
have
been
set
forth
in
--
in
detail
in
the
brief
and
we
do
not
have
too
much
of
a
quarrel
with
the
facts
in
this
particular
instance.
we
do
have
a
quarrel
with
the
results
which
have
been
reached
in
this
particular
decision.
the
complaint
--
to
refer
back
to
it
for
just
a
moment,
raises
constitutional
questions
here,
predicated
upon
the
sunday
statute,
which
raised
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
--
an
argument
that
this
sunday
law
is
invalid.
now,
the
first
one
and
the
one
that
i
think
we
have
discussed
to
some
extent
here
is
that
the
statute
in
massachusetts
is
one,
which
establishes
a
religion.
we
have
explored
part
of
that.
let
me
point
out
to
you,
your
honors
that
this
particular
statute,
if
it
is
examined
a
little
more
detailed,
pages
81
to
89
in
our
brief,
there
is
adequate
to
show
that
the
exceptions
in
the
statute
themselves,
have
now
changed
the
very
tenor
of
the
statute
so
that
it
is
one
of
a
lay
regulation
providing
for
rest,
recreation
or
providing
a
--
a
day
when
people,
if
they
desire,
may
carry-on
religious
pursuits,
where
they're
free
to
do
as
they
please.
they
are
freed
of
the
obligation
to
work
on
sunday,
other
than
for
the
necessities
that
may
be
set
forth
here
in
the
statute.
this
statute
is
attacked
on
another
ground,
your
honor.
it
is
claimed
that
as
far
as
the
particular
statute
is
concerned,
it
not
only
is
predicated
upon
religion,
but
that
it
deprives
the
complainants
in
this
particular
instance
of
due
process
of
law
in
the
sense
that
their
liberty
to
carry-on
religious
activities
have
been
restricted
and
to
the
extent
that
we
are
dealing
with
the
corporation
itself,
that
its
right
to
moneys
have
been
interfered
with.
under
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
it
is
said
for
example,
that
the
various
exceptions
which
appear
in
the
statute
are
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and
to
that
extent,
i
would
assume
that
even
if
the
statute
were
not
a
religious
one,
that
the
complainants
in
this
particular
proceeding
are
raising
the
supplementary
and
additional
ground
that
the
statute
itself
denies
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
to
the
plaintiffs
--
to
the
complainants
in
this
particular
action.
now,
to
analyze
that
problem,
we
must
look
at
the
complainants
who
are
actually
bringing
this
proceeding.
there
is
a
question
of
parties
here,
your
honor,
a
question
of
whether
or
not
they
had
a
right
to
sue.
i
believe,
we
have
put
it
forth
in
our
brief
in
some
detail
and
i
don't
intend
to
belabor
it
in
oral
argument
as
such,
but
a
brief
reference
to
that
position
as
complainants
in
relation
to
their
constitutional
rights,
i
think,
would
not
necessarily
be
out
of
order.
for
example,
your
honor,
there
are
three
individual
complainants
here
who
purport
to
be,
i
shouldn't
say
purport
to
be,
they
have
found
--
they
are
found
to
be
customers
of
this
kosher
super
market.
they
contend
and
we
have
agreed
that
they
observe
the
saturday
as
the
sabbath
and
we
have
agreed
that
they
would
not
shop
on
friday
after
sundown,
nor
would
they
shop
on
saturday
and
that
--
to
that
extent,
it
would
be
at
least
an
inconvenience
for
them,
if
they
were
unable
to
shop
on
sunday.
now,
here
your
honors,
we
have
a
problem
of
three
customers
of
a
store
complaining
on
behalf
of
the
store,
that
the
store
is
not
open.
now,
we
have
made
diligent
search
of
the
cases
and
we
have
yet
to
find
a
case
holding
that
a
customer
of
a
store
per
se,
has
a
constitutional
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
have
all
stores
remain
open.
now,
this
argument
of
course,
is
going
somewhat
--
beyond
the
basic
religious
one
as
such.
it's
the
--
the
second
part
of
it
on
due
process
as
to
the
religious
rights
of
these
customers.
and
as
we
have
pointed
out,
we
believe
any
claim
which
those
customers
may
have
in
connection
with
the
interference
with
their
right
to
shop
is
not
per
se,
one
which
should
allow
them
to
raise
its
constitutional
point.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
for
this
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
would
they
have
no
standing,
we
would
contend
they
have.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
for
the
two
reasons,
your
honor.
on
the
first
one,
is
this
a
religious
statute?
query,
how
does
a
corp
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
it
goes
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
it
goes
to
the
issue
that
we've
been
discussing.
it
may
not
be
religious.
second,
assuming
it
is
a
religious
one,
can
we
say
that
a
corporation
has
a
religion
which
is
interfered
with
by
the
statute
and
i
think
again,
that
goes
to
the
very
essence
of
it.
they
claim,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
and
we
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well
now,
in
the
pierce-sisters
case,
your
honor,
a
school
itself
was
closed
because
of
the
fact
that
the
students
were
black
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
the
rights
of
the
school,
your
honor,
may
have
been
raised
through
a
third
party
but
the
third
parties
there,
would
be
ones
who
would
have
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
the
parents
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
not
the
school
itself,
your
honor,
the
parents
thereof.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
there
were
two.
one
was
a
religious
organization
and
one,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
lay
organization.
but
to
go
one
step
further,
on
your
--
on
this
argument,
there
are
some
people
here
that
may
well
--
well
have
had
an
--
an
injury.
they
were
stockholders.
there
are
directors.
there
are
officers
and
i
would
point
out
that
not
a
single
one
of
them
joined
in
this
thing.
now,
if
there
is
an
injury
to
property,
where
are
these
stockholders?
why
didn't
they
come
in?
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
do.
i
think
they're
separate
and
distinct
entities.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
you
have
your
honor,
but
in
almost
each
one
of
them,
there
has
been
some
direct
connection
such
as
the
parents,
as
far
as
the
school
is
concerned.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
they
do.
there's
no
question
that
they
do.
but
when
we
come
to
look
at
this
particular
corporation,
your
honor
and
we
look
at
the
evidence
and
we
have
here
a
claim
that
evidence
might
have
been
insufficient,
we
have
some
evidence
of
gross
sales
on
a
given
day.
that
is
almost
the
scope
of
the
injury
to
these
stockholders.
now,
the
mere
fact
that
gross
sales
may
go
up
or
go
down,
isn't
any
real
indication
that
the
stockholders
are
thereby
hurt.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
certainly
something
they're
going
to
have
to
raise,
because
after
all,
there
is
a
--
a
constitution
--
i
mean,
a
--
an
amount
here
as
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
you
can
and
i
wish
you
would
for
this
reason,
if
you
take
judicial
notice
that
they
make
more
money
by
staying
open
on
sunday,
we
would
say
that
you
have
put
your
finger
right
on
the
difficulty
here.
as
far
as
economics
is
concerned,
these
people
obviously
benefit
by
the
fact
that
they
can
open
on
sunday
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
we
are.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
number
one,
we
would
say
no
religion
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
let
me
go,
if
i
may,
since
it's
raised,
unless
you
decide
that
i
leave
it,
but
i
like
to
raise
one
of
the
points,
your
honor.
as
far
as
standing
is
concerned
in
this
particular
proceeding,
we
would
say
that
this
corporation
has
already
had
its
day
in
court
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts.
now,
number
one,
the
manager
of
the
corporation,
the
man
who
has
verified
this
--
particular
complaint
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
previous
--
criminal
and
previous
civil
proceedings
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts,
to
which
the
corporation
was
a
party
and
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
we
would
contend
that
they
would
be
buying
here
and
that
they
would
not
have
a
right
in
this
particular
proceeding
to
raise
it.
as
far
as
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
the
manager
of
the
corporation
was
charged
with
a
crime
in
the
commonwealth.
he
raised
constitutional
issues
under
our
state
constitution
which
has
a
provision
in
it,
almost
identical
with
the
--
the
federal
and
that
is,
we
cannot
prefer
one
religion
to
another
and
again,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
in
that
particular
case,
held
on
the
basis
of
the
has
case
previously
referred
to,
that
there
was
no
interference
with
his
religious
rights
under
the
state
constitution
because
this
statute
is
not
one
regulating
a
religion.
it
doesn't
require
anybody
to
go
to
court,
to
go
to
church.
it
doesn't
prohibit
anybody
from
practicing
any
other
religion
and
they
went
through
by
citing
the
has
case,
the
--
the
various
arguments
that
had
previously
been
carried
forth
here
in
massachusetts
to
show
it's
not
religious.
now,
here's
the
interesting
part
of
it.
in
that
case,
your
honor,
in
the
criminal
one,
this
particular
manager
was
charged
with
violating
the
law
and
he
was
charged
under
the
name
of
harold
chernock,
doing
business
as
crown
kosher
market.
now,
you
will
say,
i
suppose
that
that
is
not
an
indictment
against
the
corporation
itself,
but
i
go
a
step
further.
while
that
criminal
proceeding
was
being
tested
in
our
state
courts
and
going
up
to
our
supreme
court,
the
corporation
brought
a
bill
in
equity
in
our
state
courts
seeking
to
have
the
chief
of
police
here,
mr.
gallagher,
who
has
prosecuted
these
actions,
restrained
from
carrying
out
prosecutions
until
the
case
of
harold
chernock,
the
manager,
were
determined
in
our
state
court.
and
again,
if
one
looks
at
the
--
it's
in
our
supplementary
--
it's
in
the
record
in
the
supplementary
part,
if
one
looks
at
the
petition
which
was
filed
there,
it
is
rather
curiously
described
as
the
crown
kosher
super
market,
inc.,
alias
harold
chernock,
doing
business
as
crown
market.
now,
how
we
are
suddenly
to
separate
these
two
people
and
claim
that
one
is
an
individual
and
one
is
a
corporation,
is
a
little
bit
difficult
to
follow.
the
corporation
was
in
the
state
court.
the
manager
was
in
the
state
court
and
that
both
of
them,
they
almost
referred
to,
as
the
alter
ego.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
in
effect.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
initially,
i'm
raising
it
in
the
point
of
view
of
standing
and
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
which
was
filed,
it
was
raised
that
these
particular
parties
had
no
rights
--
no
standing
and
secondly,
in
the
answer
which
was
filed,
it
was
specifically
pointed
out
to
the
district
court
that
these
parties
had
their
opportunity
in
the
state
court
via
either
the
criminal
proceeding
or
the
equity
proceeding.
and
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
it
looks
very
much
like
res
judicata.
i
would
have
difficulty,
i
suppose,
with
a
strict
interpretation
of
res
judicata
in
the
sense
that
the
criminal
proceeding
per
se,
appeared
to
be
against
harold
chernock
and
if
we
try
there
to
tie
him
in
too
closely
with
the
corporation
from
a
legal
viewpoint,
he
may
have
some
out.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
he
had
a
pretty
good
opportunity,
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
it
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
it
also
shows
that
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
he
had
a
right
to
attack
that
statute
under
the
federal
constitution
and
he
failed
to
do
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
exactly,
one
or
the
other
and
to
the
extent
that
he
failed
even
to
argue
it,
your
honor
and
call
upon
our
state
court
to
present
it,
we
would
say
that
when
this
matter
then
came
to
the
state
court
--
to
the
federal
court,
that
as
a
matter
of
equitable
jurisdiction,
they
should
have
declined
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no,
it
was
not.
and
by
failing
to
raise
it
when
he
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
it
and
come
up
to
this
court
by
certiorari
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
we
think
he
has
then
put
himself
in
a
position
where
he
not
--
cannot
claim
that
there
is
irreparable
harm
and
that
the
state
--
that
the
federal
court
should
step
in.
now,
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i'll
proceed
to
the
merits,
your
honor,
but
i
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
must
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
the
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
what
we
are
arguing
here,
almost
is
the
merits,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
justice
magruder
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
will
proceed
your
honor
along
these
grounds.
number
one,
that
if
it
may
--
if
these
parties
have
a
right
to
raise
the
question,
the
merits
then
would
be
first,
the
point
that
i
have
raised
that
this
is
not
a
religious
statute.
as
such
then,
they
would
have
no
further
standing.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
they
are
again,
proper
parties
to
raise
this
matter,
does
it
deprive
them
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws?
and
i
think
basically
there,
your
honor,
we
are
coming
to
the
question
of
the
corporation
as
to
whether,
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
it
has
been
deprived
of
its
rights
under
this
statute.
now,
the
objection
appears
to
be
that
the
limitations
in
this
statute
are
ones
which
are
arbitrary.
as
far
as
we're
able
to
determine,
your
honor,
under
the
--
the
lindsley
case,
the
--
the
various
elements
that
would
have
to
be
satisfied
by
a
complainant
would
not
here,
have
been
properly
raised.
they
would
have
to
show,
as
i
understand
it,
that
under
no
set
of
facts
--
no
reasonable
set
of
facts,
could
it
be
said
that
the
legislature
had
acted
in
an
improper
or
arbitrary
manner.
and
i
would
suggest
to
you,
your
honor,
without
going
through
each
and
every
element
in
this
particular
proceeding
that
the
statute
itself,
is
one
which
now
creates
a
day
of
rest,
whereby,
there
are
certain
exceptions
to
it
and
each
and
every
exception
would
fall
into
one
or
more
of
the
general
type
exceptions
that
would
be
expected
on
a
day
of
rest.
now,
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
we
have
gone
to
some
extent
starting
at
page
66
in
analyzing
the
type
exceptions
that
might
be
expected
in
sunday
statutes,
whether
they'd
be
in
massachusetts
or
elsewhere.
and
if
an
examination
of
those
is
made,
it
would
appear
that
here,
we
have
exceptions
as
i
mentioned
previously,
for
allowing
the
essential
industries
to
be
carried
on.
we
have
exceptions
that
will
allow
a
person
to
enjoy
a
day
of
rest
whereby,
there
can't
be
too
much
noise
as
a
result
of
these
activities.
we
have
exceptions
which
will
allow
entertainment
industries
to
be
carried
on
so
that
people
enjoying
their
day
of
rest
will
not
just
have
to
sit
home
and
--
and
not
be
able
to
carry-on
those
type
recreations
which
would
extend
to
a
--
a
day
off
as
such.
the
exceptions
per
se
then,
we
would
say
on
the
face
of
them,
can
each
and
every
one
of
them
be
explained?
now,
in
judge
magruder's
decision,
he
has
picked
out
a
few
of
them
and
pointed
to
the
fact
that
they
are
arbitrary.
he
has
pointed
out
for
example,
that
you
may
dig
oysters
on
sunday
--
excuse
me,
may
dig
clams
on
sunday,
but
you're
not
allowed
to
dredge
oysters.
well,
looking
at
it
quickly
and
say
what's
the
difference
between
a
clam
and
an
oyster,
but
again,
if
you
look
at
the
history
here
in
massachusetts,
it
becomes
quite
apparent
that
people
as
a
matter
of
pleasure,
go
down
to
the
beaches
on
low
tides
and
dig
clams.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
the
judge
would
[laughter]
--
i
think
he
prefers
clams.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
as
has
been
pointed
out
however,
by
judge
mccarthy
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
oysters
are
a
matter
of
dredging.
you
can't
just
go
down
to
the
--
the
seashore
and
pick
them
up.
you
have
to
have
heavy
equipment,
go
out
on
boats
and
things
like
that.
so,
there
is
a
rational
distinction
between
the
two.
i
would
say
then,
without
going
into
each
one
of
them,
that
i
would
ask
the
court
to
examine
the
--
the
various
arguments
that
we
have
put
forth
in
our
brief,
concerning
the
validity
or
the
invalidity
of
those
exceptions.
my
brothers,
in
their
brief,
have
pointed
out
that
the
commonwealth
has
failed
almost
entirely
to
justify
these
exceptions.
well,
it
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no,
maybe
not
your
honor,
but,
assuming
you
cannot,
the
lindsley
case
will
put
the
burden
upon
the
complainant
and
there's
not
one
iota
of
evidence
here
introduced
by
these
complainants,
which
would
have
the
result
of
showing
that
these
particular
classifications
are
improper.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
complainant
has
that
burden,
he
has
completely
failed
to
sustain
it.
and
in
his
brief,
he
has
suggested
that
the
commonwealth
or
the
chief
of
police
here
has
failed
to
explain
these
exceptions.
i
would
say
that
here,
he
has
completely
lost
track
to
the
fact
that
he
has
the
burden
of
showing
the
invalidity
of
this
statute.
now,
let
me
point
out
to
you
one
other
difficulty
that
arises
in
--
in
this
connection.
in
the
complaint,
it's
alleged
that
the
statute
is
--
is
one
of
a
religious
nature.
it's
also
urged
that
the
liberty
of
the
customers
is
interfered
with
because
of
that
religious
aspect
and
it's
urged
lastly
and
perhaps
significantly,
that
the
exceptions
in
this
particular
massachusetts
statute
are
arbitrary.
but
then
judge
magruder,
in
his
majority
opinion,
states
all
the
constitutional
exceptions
that
have
been
well
taken.
that
would
mean,
your
honor,
as
i
read
that
decision,
that
the
massachusetts
statute
is
itself
per
se,
perhaps
on
the
face
of
it,
unconstitutional
on
the
ground,
at
least
that
the
exceptions
in
it,
are
arbitrary.
if
the
exceptions
are
arbitrary,
then
what
should
the
good
judge
have
done
when
a
decree
was
entered?
i
think,
quite
clearly,
your
honors,
he
would
have
had
to
have
reached
the
conclusion
that
this
statute
as
applied
to
these
complainants
was
unconstitutional.
did
he?
he
did
not.
he
entered
a
decree
that
said,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
to
these
plaintiffs,
if
they
close
on
friday
night
and
saturday.
i
suggest
to
you,
your
honors,
if
they
opened
on
friday
night
and
they
opened
on
saturday,
how
were
the
classifications
of
the
statute
be
any
less
arbitrary
on
sunday?
to
that
extent,
your
honors,
we
would
claim
that
this
decree
as
entered
here,
certainly,
is
not
one
which
would
be
consistent
within
the
findings
of
fact
or
with
the
decree,
the
determination
on
the
law.
we
have
had
all
kinds
of
difficulties
now
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
trying
to
determine
the
validity
of
these
statutes.
now
that
point
was
called
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
after
he
entered
the
decree.
we
had
quite
a
discussion
on
the
form
of
it.
as
a
result
of
the
decree,
we
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
one
of
the
grounds
we
raised
is
that
the
decree
itself,
was
inconsistent
with
the
finding
of
the
judge
and
as
a
result
of
that
motion,
the
judge
came
back
again
with
a
--
another
determination
that
we
had
misread
his
decision.
well,
maybe
we
did
misread
it,
perhaps,
we
don't
understand
it.
but
as
far
as
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
concerned,
if
our
sunday
laws
are
to
be
thrown
out
completely,
we
ought
to
know
it.
we
ought
to
know
what
the
ground
is
because
basically
here,
this
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
problem.
the
real
question
is
this.
can
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
pick
one
day
in
seven
and
set
it
aside
as
a
day
of
rest?
if
they
can,
then
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
would
desire
to
do
so.
if
they
can
do
it
by
the
vehicle
which
they
have
here
before
them,
they
would
desire
to
do
so.
but
if
they
cannot
and
one
day
in
seven
cannot
be
picked
out
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
prohibit
that
from
being
done,
it's
about
time
we
found
out
about
it.
as
i
understand
from
reading
the
constitution
and
the
cases,
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
would
prohibit
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
from
picking
out
one
day
in
seven
if
they
so
desire,
whether
it
be
sunday,
saturday
or
any
other
day
in
the
week.
and
if
they
once
go
in
that
assumption
then
basically,
we
have
a
right
to
enact
a
statute
such
as
we
have
here,
provided
of
course,
that
we
do
not
violate
any
other
provisions.
if
we
have
violated
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
what
are
they?
i
say
that
from
this
decision
of
judge
magruder,
we
cannot
tell
what
actually
was
his
determination?
we
would
say,
if
it's
on
a
question
of
the
statute
being
arbitrary
that
he
has
gone
into
the
minds
of
the
legislature
where
the
courts
should
not
go.
he
has
gone
into
a
realm
where
the
courts
themselves
from
time
immemorial,
have
not
tread.
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
we
would
say
on
the
ground,
he
should
not
have
thrown
out
this
sunday
statute.
if
it
is
predicated
upon
the
fact
that
this
is
a
religious
statute,
then
he
is
gone
in
the
face
of
almost
every
judicial
determination
that
has
been
made
in
all
of
the
states
of
the
union
and
in
this
court.
to
that
extent,
your
honors,
we
have
gathered
together
in
our
brief
numerous
decisions
whereby,
this
court
has
passed
upon
the
merit.
it
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
there
were
approximately
10,
your
honor
that
have
been
decided
in
this
court
either
on
the
face
of
the
--
on
an
argument
or
as
a
result
of
dismissing
because
there
was
a
failure
to
state
a
--
a
constitutional
question.
the
basic
ones
and
some
of
the
earlier
ones,
your
honor,
would
be
that
hennington
v.
georgia,
where
this
very
problem
came
up,
where
they
cited
--
this
court,
your
honor,
cited
the
has
case,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
case,
saying
that
this
is
a
lay
statute.
to
that
extent,
the
--
this
court
has
again
said,
the
mere
fact
that
there
may
be
some
religious
connotations
in
connection
with
it
and
does
not
in
and
of
itself,
make
it
invalid.
and
where
this
court
has
said,
they
should
not
go
behind
the
statute
into
the
reasoning
of
the
court,
when
--
the
reasoning
of
the
legislature.
when
this
most
recently
came
up
here
on
that
freidman
case
a
few
years
back,
this
court
dismissed
it
again
on
the
ground
that
no
constitutional
question
was
raised
and
judge
magruder,
in
his
decision,
has
this
to
say
about
it.
the
new
york
statute
had
no
religious
connotations.
i'd
suggest
your
honors,
if
you
look
at
that
statute,
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
that
new
york
statute,
such
a
conclusion
could
not
be
reached.
we
would
go
one
step
further.
this
matter
has
been
raised
in
the
courts
of
all
the
states
of
the
union,
i
shouldn't
say
all
of
them
and
i'm
not
quite
sure,
say
of
alaska,
but
up
--
up
until
the
--
the
recent
two
admissions,
all
of
the
states
of
the
union
had
passed
upon
this
particular
matter
and
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
there
are
a
dozen
or
more
perhaps
i'm
a
little
high
on
that,
it's
set
forth
here
in
the
brief
where,
for
one
reason
or
another,
a
sunday
statute
was
turned
down.
ordinarily,
they
would
turn
down
on
basis
of
classification.
if
they
were
turned
down
on
basis
of
a
classification,
it
would
not
necessarily
be
any
determination
as
far
as
this
particular
court
is
concerned.
as
far
as
religion
is
concerned,
your
honor,
we
had
one
early
case
in
california
that's
in
re
newman,
which
determined
that
this
particular
statute
or
a
statute
of
this
nature
would
have
a
religious
origin.
what
happened?
it
was
overturned
two
or
three
years
later
in
the
andrews
case.
so
on
the
one
other
determination
on
a
religious
ground
where
a
court
found
that
a
sunday
closing
law
had
a
religious
connotation,
they
reversed
themselves.
where
from
there?
crown
kosher,
it
stands
alone.
it's
the
only
determination
that
we
have
to
the
effect
that
a
sunday
law
per
se,
is
a
religious
one.
it
is
a
unique
decision.
as
such,
it
violates
every
concept
that
i
understand
from
having
read
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
and
from
having
examined
the
cases
in
the
other
courts.
if
it
is
to
stand,
then
this
court
will
in
effect,
be
overruling
a
tremendous
amount
of
judicial
determination
from
the
early
times
in
this
court
and
from
the
early
times
in
the
courts
of
the
various
states.
and
i
think
before
you
do
that,
grave
thoughts
should
be
given
to
the
question
of
whether
actually,
this
is
a
religious
statute
or
whether
it
is
one
which
is
in
effect,
a
lay
regulation.
one,
which
allows
the
working
man
to
have
one
day
off
and
i
would
refer
to
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
matter.
amicus
briefs
pointing
out
that
from
the
point
of
view
of
labor,
it's
highly
desirable.
if
you
look
at
the
friedman
case,
your
honor,
which
was
up
here
before,
there's
an
amicus
brief
in
--in
--
there
are
the
statements
in
the
record
there,
your
honors,
to
the
effect
that
the
kosher
butchers,
themselves,
participated
in
favor
of
the
validity
of
the
law
on
the
ground
that
it
gave
them
one
day
--
one
additional
day
of
rest.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
there
is.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
almost
the
same,
your
honor,
but
i
point
this
out.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
oh,
yes.
this
is
in
section
six
of
our
statute,
your
honor,
which
appears
on
--
starting
on
page
84
and
on
page
87
thereof
--
thereof.
section
5,
in
effect,
is
the
prohibition.
it
shall
prohibit
the
doing
of
work
and
the
keeping
open
the
shop
on
the
lords
day.
and
then
section
six,
starting
on
page
84,
says
there
are
certain
exceptions
to
it.
it
shall
not
prohibit
and
it
shall
not
prohibit
among
other
things,
the
selling
or
delivery
of
kosher
meat
by
any
person
who
according
to
his
religious
belief,
observes
saturday
as
the
lords
day
by
closing
its
place
of
business
during
the
day
until
6
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
or
the
keeping
open
of
a
shop
on
the
lords
day
for
the
sale
of
kosher
meat
between
the
hours
of
6
o'clock
and
10
o'clock
in
the
morning,
that's
one.
secondly,
right
below,
nor
shall
it
prohibit
the
performing
of
secular
business
and
labor
on
the
lords
day
by
any
person
who
conscientiously
believes
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
ought
to
be
observed
as
the
sabbath
and
acts
to
refrain
from
secular
business
and
labor
on
that
day,
if
he
disturbs
no
other
person
nearby.
so
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
may
have
been
some
inconvenience
to
members
of
the
jewish
faith
who
in
good
faith
practice
their
religion
and
observe
saturday
there
are
special
provisions
right
in
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
for
this
reason,
your
honor.
instead
of
complying
with
this
section
which
says
he
may
stay
open
until
noon
time
to
sell
kosher
meats,
he
stayed
open
and
sold
everything.
i
jumped
over,
your
honor,
a
little
bit
on
the
facts
and
you
put
your
finger
right
on
one
of
the
problems.
this
is
a
kosher
super
market
and
if
you
look
at
the
petition,
it
says
their
selling
only
kosher
meats
and
yet,
if
you
look
at
the
facts
and
the
determination
by
judge
magruder
in
his
decision
which
will
be
a
finding
on
the
facts,
it
appears
that
they
sold
kosher
meats,
kosher
foods
of
all
kinds
and
they
sold
other
products.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
he
was
charged
with
keeping
open
his
shop
on
the
lords
day
and
it
was
held
that
a
--
a
limitation
whereby
you
may
sell
kosher
meat
on
sunday
during
certain
hours
does
not
per
se,
allow
you
to
stay
open
for
the
entire
day
and
sell
everything
else
and
that's
in
effect,
what
the
--
the
problem
was.
now,
there
is
a
question
here,
your
honor,
that's
been
argued
somewhat
in
the
briefs
concerning
this
second
problem.
if
one
observes
saturday,
can
he
stay
open
on
sunday?
if
you
note
the
last
part
there,
“if
he
disturbs
no
other
person,
he
may
keep
open
his
business,”
it
does
not
create
an
exception
on
behalf
of
a
“keeping
open
your
shop
as
such.”
you
can't
just
open
indiscriminately.
that
same
determination,
your
honor,
has
been
made
in
new
york,
so
that
both
massachusetts
and
new
york
had
the
same
kind
of
limitation
in
the
sense
that
you
cannot
indiscriminately
make
sales.
now,
there
have
been
a
few
cases
in
massachusetts
where
that
problem
was
again
raised
and
it
was
pointed
out
that
they
were
merely
selling
to
members
of
the
jewish
faith.
well
again,
you
cannot
keep
open
your
shop
for
that
purpose
and
--
and
just
allow
the
general
public
to
come
in.
if
they
desire
to
prevail
at
all,
it
would
be
under
the
first
part
that
they
initially
described,
not
the
keeping
open
of
shop
and
so
forth,
but
that
the
selling
or
delivery
of
kosher
meat.
to
that
expense
--
to
that
extent,
your
honors,
there
is
an
exception
here
which
i
have
argued
previously,
i
argue
again
to
you
now,
that
that
exception
was
not
even
raised
by
these
defendants
--
these
complainants.
to
that
extent,
your
honor,
they
are
proceeding
under
the
other
section
that
they
want
to
keep
open
their
shop
on
the
lords
day
and
that
they
are
limited
by
the
statute
so
that
they
cannot
keep
it
open
as
such.
all
they
can
do
is
sell
kosher
meats.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
we
would
say
that
the
seventh-day
adventist
may
carry-on
his
activities
on
sunday
provided
he
does
not
disturb
someone
else,
but
it
has
been
interpreted
in
massachusetts
that
carrying-on
your
business
does
not
allow
you
to
keep
open
your
shop.
our
section
5,
your
honor,
prohibits
the
doing
of
business
and
the
keeping
open
your
shop
and
the
exceptions
provide
that
if
you
observe
the
seventh
day
rather
than
sunday,
you
may
be
excused
from
the
first
of
those,
but
not
the
second.
you
may
carry-on
your
business,
but
if
your
business
is
one
of
opening
a
shop
to
the
general
public,
that
can't
be
done.
we
would
say
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
if
all
they
were
selling
would
--
was
kosher
meat,
your
honor,
a
sale
of
kosher
meat,
provided
it's
not
under
an
open
shop,
maybe
carried-on
under
this
statute.
the
selling
and
delivering
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
let
us
say,
your
honor
that
it
would
be
highly
desirable
to
have
the
store
open
for
the
purposes
of
selling
kosher
meat.
that
it
is
open
until
noon
time.
is
it
unconstitutional
to
require
that
they
close
after
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
oh,
not
quite.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
that's
right
in
one
sense,
your
honor.
he
may
sell
kosher
meat
from
an
open
shop
up
to
noon
time,
but
if
he's
not
using
his
open
shop,
the
section
just
ahead
of
it
says
he
may
sell
kosher
meat
all
day
long.
and
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
none
of
the
cases
cited
by
my
brother,
raise
any
such
point
as
i'm
urging
upon
you
now
as
far
as
this
sabbatarian
exception
is
concerned.
this
has
never
been
interpreted.
every
time
it
comes
up,
every
case
is
one
where
they
have
kept
open
their
shop
indiscriminately.
they
say
that
they
sell
only
to
jewish
people.
only
the
jewish
people
would
be
coming
in
there
and
that
kind
of
thing
but
if,
the
allegation
is
that
they're
keeping
open
shop,
massachusetts
says
you
can't
do
that.
you'd
have
to
have
a
more
limited
right
of
sale.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
no,
i
do
not
understand
the
massachusetts
statute
as
allowing
a
shop
to
be
kept
open
all
day
for
the
purpose
of
selling
kosher
meat.
it
cannot
be
done.
they
may
stay
open
under
our
statute
until
noon
time.
but
i
suggest
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
sentence
just
ahead
of
it,
if
they
don't
keep
open
their
shop
and
they
have
a
private
sale,
your
honor,
where
no
other
parties
are
disrupted,
then
the
statute
specifically
says
that
you
can
sell
kosher
meat
and
deliver
it
on
the
sabbath
if
you
close
up
--
i
mean,
on
sunday
if
you
close
up
on
the
prior
saturday.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
you
can
have
an
open
market.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
would
say
no.
this
particular
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well
now,
if
you
read
some
of
the
arguments
[laughter]
--
if
you
read
some
of
the
arguments
your
honor,
of
mr.
chernock,
when
he
was
on
the
stand,
he
took
the
position
that
everything
he
sold
was
kosher
and
if
you
look
at
it
again,
we
asked
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
in
the
sense
that
the
jewish
religion
would
not
object
to
the
purchase
of
some
of
the
items
which
he
called
kosher.
and
if
they
didn't
actually
regulate
them
and
he
sold
them,
it
was
his
contention
that
they
were
kosher.
but
it
turned
out,
your
honor,
that
he
was
including
such
things
as
a
--
products
of
the
national
biscuit
company
and
all
that
kind
of
thing,
of
which
would
not
violate
the
tenants
of
the
--
the
jewish
religion
and
we
didn't
so
contend.
but
what
we
did
say
is
that,
even
if
you
would
classify
this
kosher,
they
are,
in
effect,
going
way
beyond
the
--
the
concept
here
in
the
statute
where
you
opened
for
purposes
of
allowing
the
sale
of
kosher
meat.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
come
up,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
there
are
other
sections
in
the
statute
that
will
allow
a
man
to
sell
papers.
we
have
all
kinds
of
sections
where
you
may
buy
ice
cream
and
things
like
that
if
you're
out,
where
you
may
buy
papers,
you
may
buy
tobacco.
you
can
get
all
kinds
of
things
but
each,
in
turn,
would
have
some
connection
either
with
necessity
or
with
enjoyment
for
the
day
or
something
of
that
sort.
to
the
extent
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
think
you
get
the
perfect
idea,
but
i
think
the
question
that
was
asked
previously,
is
could
you
tell
on
all
of
them?
and
i
would
say
that
some
of
them
would
demand
a
knowledge
of
the
particular
industry
and
thus
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
i
think
this
court
has
put
the
burden
on
the
other
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
if
i
may
make
--
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
say
just
one
thing
in
closing.
yesterday,
a
question
was
asked
to
mr.
ehrmann,
i
think
by
justice
black,
as
to
what
would
happen
if
massachusetts
reenacted
its
statute,
assuming
this
court
struck
down
the
present
one
and
reenacted
it
in
a
manner
which
said
this
is
purely
a
day
of
rest,
thus,
excluding
any
problem
of
religion.
i'm
not
sure
that
we
had
a
direct
answer
to
it,
but
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
court
felt
that
massachusetts
could
reenact
a
statute
on
any
particular
day,
whether
it'd
be
thursday
or
sunday,
excluding
therefrom
any
reference
to
religion.
we
have
then
in
effect,
just
what
is
before
you
today
in
the
sense
that
our
statute
by
our
supreme
court
has
been
interpreted
to
be
one
which
is
for
a
day
of
rest.
mr.
ehrmann
has
called
attention
to
numerous
massachusetts
decisions
where
he
indicates
as
a
contrary
holding.
i
would
ask
the
court
in
examining
the
cases,
to
note
that
massachusetts
has
decided
the
question
of
religion
in
only
two
cases.
one,
is
the
has
case,
which
clearly
says
it
is
a
day
of
rest,
the
second
is
the
chernock
case,
which
very
recently,
has
reaffirmed
it.
and
any
other
case
in
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
is
not
one
which
relates
to
religion.
the
attack
in
any
of
those
other
cases
was
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
words,
whether
a
particular
individual
had
or
had
not
violated
the
statute.
so,
massachusetts
has
twice
been
called
upon
to
determine
whether
this
is
a
statute
governing
religion
or
establishing
one
and
twice
has
said
it
is
not.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
a
statute
could
be
enacted,
your
honor,
with
no
exceptions
whatsoever
in
a
sense
that
say,
if
thursday
were
picked,
there
need
be
no
exception
for
an
atheist,
there
need
be
no
exception
for
a
christian,
there
need
be
no
exception
for
a
member
of
the
jewish
faith
and
we
would
say
that
the
failure
to
put
in
an
exemption
per
se,
is
not
any
constitutional
difficulty.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
full
thrust
of
a
law
which
might
oppress
certain
groups,
whether
they
be
religious
or
economic
or
otherwise,
might
by
a
court,
be
softened
to
some
extent
by
putting
in
an
exception.
so
that
the
hardship
on
those
groups
is
somewhat
lessened
and
we
would
say
that
for
that
reason,
it
may
be
highly
desirable
to
put
them
in
but
constitutionally,
they
would
not
be
required
and
we
would
say
that
in
massachusetts,
we
have
felt
called
upon
to
do
just
exactly
that.
mr.
joseph
h.
elcock,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
concede
that
if
an
exception
in
a
statute
were
put
in,
in
a
broad
enough
form,
it
may
well
prefer
one
minority
in
a
manner
which
would
not
give
such
similar
preference
to
another
minority.
and
to
that
extent,
the
--
inclusion
of
some
of
these
bits
of
exception
might
well
run
afoul
of
a
--
a
constitutional
problem,
but
here,
if
there
is
an
exception,
it
certainly
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
jewish
people
and
for
the
jewish
people
then
under
this
exception,
the
claim
that
they
are
injured
as
a
minority
is
-
is
i
think,
using
this
particular
exception
in
reverse.
thank
you.
