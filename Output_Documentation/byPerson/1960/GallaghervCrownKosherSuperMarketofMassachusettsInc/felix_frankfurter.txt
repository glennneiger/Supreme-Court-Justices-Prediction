but
the
claim
is
that
economic
pressure
of
being
closed
on
sunday
is
an
economic
pressure
that
is
referable
to
religious
--
to
impermissible
religious
restriction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
shall
we
put
it
to
get
around
to
the
fact,
the
claim
is
that
their
religion
makes
them
close
on
saturday
and
--
and
the
state
does
something
on
sunday
which
they
would
be
free
to
do
but
for
a
religious
interference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
challenge
the
right
of
crown
kosher
super
market?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
they
have
no
standing?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
--
that
goes
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
to
the
issue.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
this
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
pierce-sisters
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
school
in
the
pierce-society
of
sisters.
justice
felix
frankfurter
was
the
school
a
party
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
don't
know.
i'll
look
it
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
the
school
itself
--
does
the
school
itself,
come
before
this
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
know
the
parents
did,
but
i
am
asking
whether
the
school
--
possibly,
that
may
have
been
a
religious
organization,
if
it
isn't
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
the
--
a
corporation
can't
exert
to
represent
its
stock
--
stockholders,
in
such
a
suit?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
know
they
are,
but
we
have
held
that
entities
are
separate
and
distinct
may
urge
causes
that
are
inexplicable
and
wound
up
with
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
should
think
a
corporation
having
profit
or
non-profit,
has
some
relations
with
stockholders.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
it
really
needs
proof
that
if
they
were
allowed
to
be
open
on
sunday,
they'd
make
more
money?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
think
they
could
take
judicial
notice
that
if
they
were
open
on
sunday,
they'd
have
more
customers
than
if
they're
closed
on
sunday?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
now,
you're
going
to
substantive
issues.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
understand
that.
well,
i'm
now
addressing
myself
into
your
question
of
standing
and
wondering
whether
you
need
to
spend
much
time
on
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
time,
not
mine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think,
you
can
tell
by
just
looking
at
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
sabbatarian
exception,
can
you
sell
watermelons
on
sunday?
can
kosher
shops
sell
--
sell
watermelons
on
a
sunday
morning?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
watermelons
are
not
kosher
or
grapes
either.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
think
as
an
extension
he
might
have
been
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
sold
papers
for
telegraphs,
the
supporting
paper
it
would
be
kosher,
wouldn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
something
inscrutable
that
we
lawyers
--
we
judges
couldn't
tell
merely
by
reading
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
there,
you
put
the
burden
on
the
other
fellow
--
and
then
put
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i'd
be
--
i
mean,
your
argument
would
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
was
arithmetic
--
that
wasn't
a
motive?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
they
said
that
those
decisions
that
they
say
it
was
a
statute
in
relation
to
religion
or
is
that
the
conclusion
you
draw
from
their
phrases
about
observance,
which
is
that?
they
didn't
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
they
didn't
say
this
is
a
statute
to
promote
some
religion
and
to
embarrass
others,
did
they?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
when
you
say
they
accepted
a
religious
statute,
you
mean
that
which
--
the
manner
in
which
they
describe
that
adds
up
to
and
say
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
support
or
help
to
a
further
religion.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
your
argument
isn't
that
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
has
given
a
characterization
of
this
statute
as
a
religion-promoting
statute?
you
argue
that
the
consequence
of
it,
the
details
of
the
statute,
the
way
it
entrenches
in
certain
things
and
it
proves
it
other
things
and
these
are
conclusions
that
if
we
are
to
take
them
here
are
a
religious
kind.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
that's
enough
to
invalidate
the
--
if
that's
enough
to
render
a
statute
with
such
exceptions
unconstitutional
as
denying
equal
protection
of
the
law,
then
according
to
your
statement
a
minute
ago,
almost
all
legislation
would
have
to
fall
because
you
quite
like
[attempt
to
laugher]
submitted
yourself
to
the
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
denying
the
particular
proposition
that
almost
all
legislation
is
a
product
of
pressures.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
one
have
to
defend
all
exceptions
in
legislation
like
this
on
a
--
on
an
obviously
rational
basis
in
order
to
save
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
maybe
yielding
to
pressure
maybe
sufficient
justification
for
an
enactment
in
order
to
save
the
larger
things
that
the
legislature
might
think
it
could
save
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
is
all
now
on
the
question
that
--
on
--
on
the
assumption
that
a
sunday
rest
statute
would
be
within
the
so-called,
police
power
of
the
state.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
you
don't
make
and
goes
on
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
make
and
goes
on
to
religion,
then
--
then
the
personal
right
is
merely
the
right
to
do
what
you
please,
but
nothing
specific.
that
is,
if
things
were
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
the
state
matters,
liberty
in
a
shelf
is
an
end
of
man,
unless
there's
some
refuses
for
taking
away
of
it
or
part
of
it
away
or
limit
it.
so,
it's
not
really
what
the
short
hand
would
call
the
first
amendment
right
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
we
have
--
we
passed
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
we're
now
appealing
with
the
exception
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
i'm
saying
is
the
religious
--
the
exceptions
--
the
exceptions
are
not
relevant
or
at
least
they
don't
--
they
do
not
raise
the
problem
if
you're
still
considering
invalidation
because
it's
an
inroad
on
the
area
of
religious
freedom,
whatever
that
may
be
the
--
whatever
concerns
that
may
have.
these
exceptions,
these
are
the
total
differences
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
having
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
digging
oysters
certainly,
is
no
religious
problem.
it's
between
oysters
and
--
and
clams.
justice
felix
frankfurter
no.
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
we
have
held
even
in
tax
cases,
were
knocked
down
where
the
state
court
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
going
to
take
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
maybe
the
court
takes
over
an
independent
assessment?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
other
words,
the
legislature
in
that
field
doesn't
operate
at
all
without
--
with
any
of
the
implications
that
the
power
of
legislation
rested
in
them,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
understand
the
difference.
i
understand
the
difference
of
the
content
of
the
two
types
of
legislation.
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
in
this
second
class
to
which
you
advert,
the
legislature
--
the
action
of
the
legislature
is
immaterial
and
this
court
sits
quite
independently
in
asserting
what
is
or
is
not
a
--
a
fair
restriction
because
all
of
us
are
restricted
to
some
extent
in
our
legislature.
all,
whether
it's
religion,
whether
it's
speech,
whether
it's
teaching,
whether
it's
anything,
nobody
can
fully
do
what
he
pleases
in
(inaudible)
in
one
way.
so
when
that
adjustment
has
to
be
struck,
and
what
i
want
to
know
whether
in
those
situations,
the
legislature
is
out
altogether
and
we
determine
it
as
though
there
had
been
no
judgment
by
the
legislature
that
this
is
desirable
or
needed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
you
don't
go
that
far
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
then
you
have
to
give
us
some
guide
how
--
where
to
stop
before
we
get
there.
justice
felix
frankfurter
including
sleep
which
isn't
provided.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
even
if
you
give
favors
that
you
need
not
give
anybody,
if
you
get
them
to
some,
does
that
preclude
the
writing
--
the
unequal
protection
of
the
law?
