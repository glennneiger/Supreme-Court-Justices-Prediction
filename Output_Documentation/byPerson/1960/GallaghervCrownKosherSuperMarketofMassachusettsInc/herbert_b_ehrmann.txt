mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
say
that
i
can
well
understand
the
difficulty
that
some
of
the
justices
are
having
in
understanding
the
chapter
136,
insofar
as
it
relates
to
people
who
keep
the
sabbath
day
on
the
--
on
saturday.
there
was
trouble
in
the
court
--
in
the
three-judge
court
on
that.
the
reason
for
that
is
not
that
these
--
these
portions
of
this
law
have
not
been
adequately
interpreted.
they
have
been
interpreted,
but
they
have
been
interpreted
by
our
supreme
court
in
such
a
strange
way
that
is
hard
to
believe
it.
now,
if
your
honors
will
turn
to
the
act
which
appears
in
mr.
elcock's
brief,
section
5
is
the
section
which
forbids
the
keeping
open
of
a
shop
or
the
doing
of
any
labor
business
or
works
except
works
of
necessity
and
charity,
that's
on
page
84.
then,
you
turn
to
page
87
and
you
see
where
the
first
complete
paragraph
begins
and
that
is
the
language
which
says,
“nor
shall
it
prohibit
the
performing
of
secular
business
and
labor
on
the
lords
day,”
i
call
your
attention
to
secular
business
and
labor
on
the
lords
day,
by
any
person
who
conscientiously
believes
that
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
ought
to
be
observed
as
the
sabbath
and
actually
refrains
from
secular
business
and
labor
on
that
day.
now,
mr.
chernock
urged
that
in
his
exceptions
to
our
supreme
court
and
our
supreme
court
ruled
on
the
basis
of
commonwealth
against
has,
that
that
language
did
not
permit
the
opening
of
a
shop.
it
was
not
included
in
secular
business
and
labor.
they
said,
relying
on
commonwealth
against
has,
that
he
could
not
maintain
his
shop
under
that,
no
matter
whether
he
did
or
did
not
observe
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
as
the
sabbath.
now,
you
move
just
above
that
and
you'll
find
a
more
recent
exception
which
says,
"nor
shall
it
forbid
the
keeping
open
of
his
shop
on
the
lords
day
for
the
sale
of
kosher
meat
between
the
hours
of
6
o'clock
and
10
o'clock
in
the
fore
noon,
not
noon,
10
o'clock
in
the
fore
noon."
i
will
not
at
this
point,
comment
upon
the
practical
effect
of
that
section.
the
three-judge
majority
opinion
found
that
that
was
wholly
impracticable
and
impossible
really,
for
any
business
to
operate
on.
but,
you
will
see
that
the
keeping
open
his
shop
on
the
lords
day
for
the
sale
of
kosher
meat
between
the
hours
of
6
o'clock
and
10
o'clock
and
the
fore
noon,
is
the
section
under
which
mr.
chernock
was
convicted.
so
that,
i
don't
understand
what
there
is
to
be
interpreted.
he
has
been
convicted
under
that
clause.
he
was
not
allowed
to
escape
under
the
next
section
and
not
only
does
commonwealth
against
chernock
hold
this,
but
my
brother
and
friend
here
apparently,
has
forgotten
the
case
of
commonwealth
against
starr,
which
is
cited
on
our
brief,
because
that
very
neatly
disposes
of
nearly
all
of
his
contentions
that
there
were
still
something
to
be
interpreted
in
that
section.
commonwealth
against
starr
was
a
case
in
which
a
--
a
rabbi
kept
his
house
open
for
the
sale
only
of
kosher
products
to
members
of
his
congregation.
he
closed
on
saturday.
he
sold
only
to
members
of
his
congregation
who
also
observed
saturday
as
the
sabbath
and
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts
said
that
didn't
make
any
difference.
he
kept
open
his
shop.
that
was
enough.
so
that,
the
suggestion
that
it
was
because
mr.
chernock
sold
to
other
people
or
because
he
sold
things
that
were
not
strictly
kosher,
under
our
decisions,
has
no
relevance.
here
was
a
man
who
sold
only
to
members
of
his
own
congregation.
he
was
a
rabbi.
he
was
authorized
to
call
the
food
kosher,
which
he
did
and
see
to
it
that
his
congregation
bought
only
that
type
of
food.
then
there
was
another
jewish
merchant
or
manufacturer
who
tried
to
avoid
the
impact
of
this
statute
by
not
selling
anybody.
he
had
a
little
shop
for
8
or
10
people,
that's
commonwealth
versus
kershaw.
it
is
also
on
our
brief.
he'd
did
deem
open
it,
he
just
left
the
door
open
for
8
or
10
employees
to
come
into
the
shop
and
they
closed
the
door
and
locked
it,
so
they
couldn't
disturb
anybody.
they
were
all
jewish.
they
all
observed
the
--
the
seventh
day
of
the
week
as
a
sabbath.
he
was
convicted.
he
kept
the
shop
and
it
didn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
opened
it
or
whether
he
didn't
open
it
or
whether
he
disturbed
anybody
or
whether
he
didn't
disturb
anybody
or
whether
he
sold
anything
to
anybody
or
not.
he
kept
open
his
shop
and
that's
been
the
interpretation
of
that
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
we've
cited
the
cases
on
our
brief.
i
have
mentioned
only
a
few
involving
jewish
merchants.
the
foundation
case
is
commonwealth
versus
has
that
started
all
this
trouble.
he
was
a
seventh-day
adventist.
now,
i'm
saying
this
because
i
feel
that
at
the
outset
we
should
understand
that
there
just
isn't
any
question
about
opening
a
shop.
under
any
of
these
conditions,
it's
forbidden.
even
under
that
six
to
ten
statute,
they
can't
sell
anything
but
meat
--
kosher
meat,
nothing
else
and
then
they
have
to
quit
at
10
o'clock.
it
would
perhaps
be
important
at
this
stage
to
call
attention
to
the
realities
of
this
situation.
some
of
the
justices
mentioned
it
at
the
start
of
--
of
mr.
elcock's
argument.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
violation
of
the
symbols
of
religion
as
some
of
the
very
important
cases
that
have
come
before
you
have
had.
we
are
talking
about
hardship,
about
serious
interference
with
the
liberty
of
people.
there
are
findings
of
fact
in
this
case
concerning
the
obligations
of
orthodox
use
to
observe
the
sabbath.
they
may
not
travel.
they
may
not
ride
in
automobiles.
they
may
not
even
light
lights.
they
had
to
do
their
cooking
on
friday
so
that
they
don't
have
to
cook
on
saturday,
on
the
sabbath.
the
sabbath
evening
is
a
joyous
occasion
where
they
have
the
best
meal
of
the
week.
saturday,
they
go
to
the
synagogue
and
saturday
afternoon,
they
also
have
a
celebration.
the
family
all
get-together
and
celebrate
the
sabbath.
they're
not
allowed
to
buy
anything
on
the
sabbath.
now,
we
have
this
statute
that
says
that
there
can
be
no
store
that
sells
food
that
their
--
the
only
kind
of
food
that
under
their
religion,
if
they
live
up
to
it,
they
may
eat,
must
be
closed
on
sunday.
the
effect
of
that
is
if
it's
enforced,
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
crown
kosher
super
market
would
have
to
go
out
of
business.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
under
one
--
under
one
of
our
principles,
it
would
be
--
it
would
be
because
the
exception
in
favor
of
those
who
conscientiously
observed
the
seventh
day
as
the
sabbath
on
the
basis
of
one
of
the
interferences
with
religion
to
which
i
will
advert
that
that
would
be
essential.
now,
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
--
the
law
takes
property
without
due
process
of
law
or
whether
it
is
--
denies
equal
protection,
it's
possible
that
that
would
make
a
--
would
not
make
a
difference.
i'll
put
it
perhaps
in
this
--
in
this
vice.
let
us
for
the
moment,
accept
my
brother's
statement
which
we
cannot
accept
as
i
will
hope
to
show
you
in
a
few
minutes,
that
this
is
a
day
of
rest
statute,
a
universal
day
of
rest.
not
--
not
just
the
one
day
in
a
week
but
that
everybody
has
to
rest
on
the
same
day
and
let
us
further
assume
which
i
cannot
at
this
time
concede,
that
it
is
within
the
police
power
of
the
state
to
establish
such
--
such
a
law.
and
let
us
further
assume
that
the
massachusetts
court
in
commonwealth
against
has
and
indeed,
many
other
--
courts
are
right,
in
saying
that
they
selected
sunday,
my
brother
made
this
argument,
as
the
day
of
rest,
because
the
majority
of
people
already
observed
sunday
as
our
court
in
commonwealth
versus
has
said,
"because
it
is
a
day
of
peculiar
sanctity
to
the
majority
of
people
who
are
christians."
do
they
not,
when
they
do
that,
make
it
easy
for
those
who
are
already
observing
sunday
because
they
already
refrain
from
work,
they
already
regard
the
day
as
sacred?
so
that,
they
lose
only
one
day
a
week,
whereas
if
that
law
is
enforced
without
an
exception
in
favor
of
those
who
observe
another
day
as
the
sabbath,
they
lose
two
days
a
week.
they
lose
100
days
during
the
year,
instead
of
50
days
in
a
year
or
52
days
in
a
year.
and
that
mr.
justice
douglas,
is
the
best
answer,
i
think
at
the
moment,
i
can
give
you
that
--
that
that
does
play
a
vital
part
and
that
if
was
a
question
of
an
atheist
under
certain
branch
of
this
argument,
it
would
not
be
unconstitutional
as
against
him
--
i
mean,
as
--
as
applied
--
but
as
applied
against
somebody
who
observed
the
seventh
day
as
the
sabbath,
it
is
a
discrimination.
it
is
a
preference
of
one
religion
over
another.
it
is
a
denial
of
--
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
that
point
incidentally,
was
made
by
a
number
of
our
middle-western
courts.
i
know
their
statues
are
different.
i
think
those
statutes
while
i
haven't
read
them,
but
from
the
decision,
they
seem
to
be
just
simply
day
of
rest
statutes
and
that's
all.
they
had
these
exceptions
in
favor
of
those
who
observed
another
day
as
the
sabbath
and
those
exceptions
were
attacked.
in
ohio,
i
think,
indiana
and
kentucky
as
unconstitutional.
the
judge
in
--
in
the
indiana
case,
johns
versus
the
state,
which
is
cited
on
our
brief,
said
this
in
sustaining
the
constitutionality
of
that
exception.
"without
the
proviso
which
is
said
to
breakdown
the
law,
a
large
number
of
citizens
would
be
compelled
to
lose
two
days
of
labor
--
two
days
of
labor,
one
day
because
of
their
conscientious
convictions
of
religious
duty
and
one
by
the
--
the
command
of
the
municipal
law.
we
know
that
there
are
sects
of
christians
who
conscientiously
believe
the
seventh
day
to
be
divinely
ordained
sabbath.
we
know
too,
that
there
is
a
great
people
who,
for
many
centuries
and
through
relentless
persecution
interpret
the
files,
had
flung
without
unswerving
fidelity
to
the
faith
of
their
fathers
that
the
seventh
day
is
the
true
sabbath.
if
the
proviso
will
wrench
from
the
statute,
these
classes
of
citizens
will
be
compelled
in
obedience
to
their
religious
convictions,
to
rest
from
the
labor
on
the
seventh
and
by
the
law,
also
compelled
to
refrain
from
common
labor
on
the
first
day
of
the
week."
and
the
judge
said
that,
so
far
as
he
was
concerned,
he
would
not
enforce
that
law
against
those
who
observe
the
seventh
day
as
the
sabbath.
now
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
pardon?
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
said
we
will
not
concede.
i
think
that's
a
--
that's
a
debate
of
the
matter
meant
by
that
--
and
we
won't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case,
i
don't
think.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
if
there
were
an
exception
in
the
statute
for
those
who
observe
another
day
as
a
sabbath
that
aspect
of
it
would
be
taken
cared
of.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
do
not
have
to
go
that
far.
i'm
dealing
with
the
massachusetts
statute
and
the
massachusetts
statute
mr.
justice,
is
a
--
as
we
will
see,
is
a
religious
statute.
now,
whether
or
not,
just
a
general
--
there's
a
general
power
to
sue
--
to
appropriate
one
day
not
of
rest,
for
most
of
these
states
already
have
a
day
of
rest
in
the
seven,
but
a
universal
day
of
rest
on
which
everybody
has
to
stop
at
the
same
time.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
of
any
--
any
data
or
sociological
information
or
anything
that
would
lead
us
in
a
modern
world
to
--
to
be
so
sure
that
there
is
such
a
power.
that
is
something
of
course,
which
the
justices
here
may
wrestle
with.
i
don't
think
you'll
have
to
do
it
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
confine
my
argument
to
the
massachusetts
statute
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
which
is
my
duty
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
--
all
i
should
do.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
it
is
a
--
that
it
is
a
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
first
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
may
i
come
to
that
now.
i
didn't
actually
finish
what
i
was
saying,
but
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
mr.
justice
douglas
asked
me
the
question,
what
i
was
coming
to
and
i'll
dispose
of
that
in
--
in
a
half
a
minute,
was
that
the
orthodox
community
and
the
store
in
this
case
are
faced
with
the
dilemma
and
that
dilemma
is
that
either
they
--
if
the
--
if
the
law
is
enforced,
either
they
give
up
a
second
day
in
a
year
from
secular
pursuits
or
else,
they
give
up
their
own
belief
in
the
sabbath
as
the
seventh
day.
that
is
the
dilemma
with
which
they're
faced
and
that
is
a
real
dilemma
and
a
real
hardship
and
over
and
above
that,
is
the
consideration
that
was
mentioned
earlier
in
my
brother's
argument,
namely
that
there
is
the
compulsion
both
economic
and
social,
in
this
sunday
closing
law
to
make
people
abandon
their
own
religion.
and
that
comes
under
mr.
justice
black's
own
definition
in
the
--
in
the
celebrated
case
involving
the
support
of
school
buses,
namely
that
not
only
as
i
will
show
does
this
statute
prefer
one
religion
over
another
and
aid
one
religion
at
the
expense
of
another,
but
influences
people
to
give
up
their
own
faith.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
may
i
now,
advert
to
that.
i
think
that
that
really
--
we're
getting
back
down
to
the
--
to
the
heart
of
this
question.
in
order
to
ascertain
what
this
massachusetts
law
really
is,
we
should
start
with
what
it
started
with
and
then
end
with
what
it
is
now
and
let
us
see
what
has
happened.
first,
i
would
like
to
have
you
look
at
this
statute
through
the
eyes
of
our
supreme
judicial
court
back
in
1816
and
then
i
would
like
to
take
you
to
the
last
decided
case
before
the
chernock
case.
this
early
case
was
the
case
of
pearce
against
atwood,
where
a
justice
of
the
peace
arrested
a
traveler
on
a
large
day
and
the
court
there
said
it
would
certainly
seem
extraordinary
that
a
statute
enacted
for
the
sole
object
of
ensuring
reverence
and
respect
for
one
day
of
the
week,
in
order
that
religious
exercises
should
be
performed
without
interruption
from
common
and
secular
employments,
should
authorize
acts
which
from
their
necessary
publicity,
would
be
likely
to
cause
more
disturbance
to
devout
people
and
all
the
irregularities
intended
to
be
cured
and
then
the
court
went
on
to
say
this.
it
is
true
from
the
fourth
command
in
the
decalogue,
it
may
be
inferred
that
one
day
in
seven
was,
according
to
the
divine
will
to
be
set
apart
as
a
day
of
rest
from
labor,
but
none
will
contend
that
the
day
therein
sanctified,
is
the
day
which
christians
are
bound
to
keep
as
holy
time
or
that
any
of
the
rigid
laws
of
moses
relative
to
the
observance
of
that
day
are
now
enforced.
it
is
enough
to
observe
that
by
universal
consent
of
christians,
another
holy
day
has
been
substituted.
that
was
our
court
in
1816.
now,
in
commonwealth
versus
mccarthy
in
1923,
our
supreme
court
and
that
was
the
last
case
that
characterized
our
sunday
closing
law
prior
to
the
chernock
conviction.
the
court
there,
and
this
was
an
odd
case
too,
because
if
you
examine
the
statute
very
carefully,
you
will
see
that
while
at
certain
hours,
bread
may
be
sold,
this
baker
was
charged
with
delivering
bread
to
the
--
to
common
victuallers
and
the
court
held
that
although
he
could
bake
bread,
and
he
could
sell
bread
at
certain
hours,
he
couldn't
deliver
it
to
his
customers
and
this
was
the
decision.
the
delivery
of
bread
outside
the
premises
of
the
baker
on
the
lords
day
is
not
a
work
of
necessity
within
the
meaning
of
the
lords
day
statute.
the
statute
prohibiting
the
performance
of
labor,
business
or
work
except
works
of
necessity
and
charity
on
sunday
was
enacted
to
secure
respect
and
reverence
for
the
lords
day.
and
then,
the
court
goes
on
to
quote
with
approval,
citing
the
language
and
adopting
it
of
davis
against
summerville
which
was
decided
three
years
after
the
case
of
commonwealth
against
has
that
my
brother
adverted
to.
i'll
speak
about
that
decision
in
a
moment.
it
was
characterized
by
judge
magruder
as
an
ad
hoc
decision
and
i
think
that
this
court
will
agree
with
judge
magruder's
characterization
of
that
decision,
but,
this
was
three
years
after
that
decision
and
it
was
adopted
in
1923.
the
statute
making
it
unlawful
and
criminal
to
travel
on
the
lords
day
except
from
necessity
and
charity,
has
retained
its
place
in
our
statute
books
from
the
earliest
time
--
times
in
the
history
of
the
state.
this
also
was
a
curious
offense.
the
defendant
in
this
case
travelled
on
the
lords
day
and
at
that
time,
the
statute
included
that.
they
hadn't
eliminated
it
and
he
was
accused
of
violating
the
lords
day
statute,
because
he
had
gone
to
a
funeral
which
was
regarded
as
a
journey
of
necessity.
but
in
coming
home
from
the
funeral,
he
stopped
to
call
on
a
friend
and
they
said
he
--
he
had
to
come
straight
home
because
otherwise,
it
was
a
violation
of
the
lords
day
statute
and
the
conviction
was
upheld.
so,
you
--
the
court
went
on
to
say
in
upholding
that
conviction,
our
puritan
ancestors
intended
that
the
day
should
be
not
merely
a
day
of
rest
from
labor,
but
also
a
day
devoted
to
public
and
private
worship
and
to
religious
meditation
and
repose,
undisturbed
by
secular
cares
or
amusements.
they
saw
fit
to
enforce
the
observance
of
the
day
by
penal
legislation
and
the
statute
regulations
which
they
devised
for
that
purpose
have
continued
to
enforce
without
any
substantial
modification
to
the
present
time.
whatever
inconveniences
might
result
at
the
present
day
from
the
literal
and
general
enforcement
of
the
lords
day
act
and
whatever
hard
cases
may
arise
--
may
have
arisen
under
it,
it
is
still
the
law
of
the
land
to
be
judicially
interpreted
and
administered
according
to
its
true
intent
and
meaning
and
upon
the
same
rules
as
would
govern
us
in
the
interpretation
of
any
other
statute.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
case
was
decided
three
years
after
the
--
the
commonwealth
against
has.
it
was
decided
1880,
but
adopted
in
1923
by
commonwealth
against
mccarthy.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
don't
suppose
that
if
it's
a
motive
that
isn't
exhibited
in
the
act
itself,
that
it
would
be
clear
that
you
have
a
right
to,
although
this
court
has
on
occasion
and
very
recently,
has
invalidated
an
act
which
was
within
the
power
to
do
but
looked
at
the
motive
to
see
the
effects
of
the
act
to
interpret
the
motive
which
was
to
eliminate
colored
people
from
a
certain
precinct.
now,
in
this
case,
we
were
not
confronted
with
that.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
it
was
arithmetic
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
if
--
if
a
properly
drawn
act
were
--
were
passed,
i
would
suppose
then
that
it
would
have
to
be
examined
in
the
light
of
all
the
circumstances.
i
--
i
find
it
difficult
if
your
honor
please,
to
give
any
intelligent
opinion
of
an
act
which
i
haven't
read,
the
history
of
which
i
know
nothing
about
or
the
purposes
of
which
i
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
in
this
case,
this
act
on
its
face
is
an
act
to
compel
observance
of
saturday
as
the
lords
day.
i
was
coming
to
that
in
a
moment
because
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
is
correct,
but
if
we
have
an
act
which
is
plainly
an
act
to
compel
observance
of
the
lords
day
for
religious
reasons,
then
i
would
suppose
that
the
labors
of
this
court
would
be
ended
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
you
would
have
a
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
you
would
have
entirely
different
considerations.
you
might
come
to
the
same
conclusion,
but
you
would
have
different
considerations.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
correct.
the
--
if
you
find
that
this
is
a
statute
to
enforce
observance
of
the
lords
day,
that
would
be
the
end
of
this
case
because
under
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
if
a
--
if
a
law
is
passed
in
furtherance
of
one
religion
as
against
another
or
to
influence
people
with
regard
to
their
religion
to
desert
it
that
that
act
would
be
unconstitutional
and
every
court
that
i
have
seen
that's
decided
on
this
have
held
--
has
held
that
if
the
purpose
were
religious
purposes,
the
statute
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
the
new
york
court
has
also,
recited
on
our
brief,
has
held
definitely
that
it
could
not
be
supported
on
a
religious
basis.
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
statute
itself.
i've
been
doing
something
that
i
shouldn't
do.
i've
been
talking
about
the
statute.
i've
been
quoting
what
our
judges
have
said
about
the
statute,
but
the
proper
study
of
a
statute
is
the
statute.
and
if
you
would
look
at
this
statute,
i
think
that
you
are
in
for
an
experience.
our
three-judge
court,
at
least
two
of
the
judges
were
astonished
at
a
statute
today
reading
as
this
one
has.
not
only
does
it
continue
to
use
such
phrases
even
in
modern
amendments
as
that
--
this
entertainment
may
be
permitted
if
it
is
in
keeping
with
the
character
of
the
day
and
the
due
observance
thereof.
just
what
that
means
with
respect
to
a
day
of
rest,
i
don't
know,
but
that
is
part
of
the
language.
they
used
the
word,
“secular”
constantly
to
distinguish
sunday
from
other
days
in
the
week.
they
have
permitted
certain
activities.
my
brother
here
has
mentioned
the
fact
that
there
have
been
these
added
exceptions.
if
the
statute
was
originally
a
statute
to
enforce
a
day
of
rest,
to
a
--
originally,
a
--
a
statute
to
enforce
observance
of
the
lords
day,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
cutting
it
down
and
allowing
more
things
to
be
done
so
as
to
increase
the
number
of
things
which
may
be
done
seven
days
a
week
instead
of
six
days
a
week,
indicates
a
purpose
to
have
a
day
of
rest
and
that's
all
these
exceptions
have
done.
they've
increased
the
number
of
things
that
can
be
done
seven
days
a
week,
instead
of
six
and
that
according
to
my
brother
here,
is
suppose
to
indicate
that
the
statute
has
now
been
transformed
from
a
religious
statute
into
a
day
of
rest.
the
very
hour
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i'm
coming
to
that.
i
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
--
that
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
commonwealth
against
has
came
in
1877
after
a
stream
of
decisions
holding
that
this
statute
was
a
religious
statute.
commonwealth
against
has
was
the
first
case
in
which
the
question
of
--
of
constitutionality
under
the
religious
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
massachusetts
constitution
were
raised.
thereupon,
the
court
out
of
a
clear
sky
without
any
analysis
of
the
statute
at
all,
without
any
reference
to
the
many
cases
that
have
gone
before
stating
that
it
was
to
ensure
reverence
of
--
of
the
lords
day,
proceeded
to
say
that
it
was
merely
a
civil
regulation
providing
for
a
fixed
period
of
rest
in
the
business
and
ordinary
evocations
and
the
amusements
of
the
community.
incidentally,
that
reference
to
amusements
of
the
community
is
also
a
little
strange
because
mr.
elcock
has
now
argued
that
it
is
not
only
transited
from
a
religious
statute
to
a
day
of
rest
statute
that
has
now
become
an
amusement
statute.
that
it
is
--
its
purpose
is
now
to
allow
people
to
enjoy
themselves
on
sunday
and
go
to
the
ballgame
and
go
fishing
and
digging
clams.
now,
the
hours
--
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
some
of
the
hours
of
the
exceptions
which
are
so
clearly
hours
to
protect
church
worship.
now,
there's
no
reason
why
there
shouldn't
be
protection
of
church
worship,
but
it
indicates
an
attempt
to
preserve
the
character,
the
original
character
of
the
statute
even
while
the
exceptions
are
being
made.
for
instance,
outdoor
lawn
bowling,
golf
driving
ranges
and
so
forth,
are
--
are
permitted.
amusement
parks
and
beaches,
license
to
operate
bowling
alleys,
private
industrial
trade
expositions,
participation
in
or
witnessing
athletic
sports
or
games
and
there
is
no
one
of
these
that's
allowed
to
be
given
before
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon.
why?
if
it's
a
day
of
rest,
why
--
why
can't
they
do
that
before
1
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
or
if
it's
just
to
promote
amusements?
incidentally,
i
have
a
difficulty
there
also,
a
logical
difficulty,
by
allowing
people
to
--
to
pursue
amusements
on
sunday
that
they've
already
been
pursuing
for
six
days
a
week,
does
not
seem
to
me
to
constitute
sunday
a
day
to
pursue
amusements.
but
if
it
is
a
day
to
pursue
amusements,
then
i
think
perhaps,
we
ought
to
reexamine
the
entire
basis
for
the
exercise
of
police
power
which
makes
people
stay
away
from
secular
pursuits
52
days
a
year
and
--
and
people
who
believe
in
the
seventh
day,
104
days
a
year,
as
it
would
--
cannot
be
weighed
against
the
interference
with
liberty
and
property
which
this
act
creates.
now,
here
are
-
here
are
a
few
more
that
are
astounding.
the
retail
sale
of
bread
is
allowed
between
10:00
a.m.
and
--
and
is
allowed
before
10:00
a.m.
and
between
4:00
p.m.
and
6:30
p.m.
transportation
of
general
commodities
by
motor
truck
or
trailer
before
8:00
a.m.
and
after
8:00
p.m.,
that's
interstate
trucks.
now,
one
would
suppose
that
it
would
disturb
rest
much
more
to
have
these
trucks
rumble
around
in
the
morning
than
during
the
day,
but
this
is
the
provision.
here
again,
i
say
it
--
it's
to
quiet
down
things
before
church
services
on
sunday.
transportation
of
petroleum
products
from
motor
truck
are
permitted
only
before
6:00
a.m.
and
after
10:00
p.m.,
the
selling
of
bake
--
sale
of
bakery
products
by
bakers
before
10:00
a.m.
and
between
4:00
p.m.
and
6:30
p.m.,
the
sale
of
kosher
meat
by
the
observers
of
the
seventh
day
as
the
sabbath,
between
6:00
a.m.
and
10:00
a.m.
now,
it
is
difficult
to
understand
what
logical
connection
that
would
have
with
either
a
day
of
rest
or
amusement.
one
would
suppose
that
the
opening
of
a
shop
so
early
in
the
morning,
if
it
ever
was
opened
early
and
if
any
customers
would
ever
come
at
that
hour,
would
be
disturbing
to
rest,
rather
than
otherwise.
and
certainly,
if
it's
a
day
of
amusement
for
people
to
come
in
and
buy
some
salami
for
a
picnic,
would
aid
in
that
pursuit.
no,
these
--
these
hours
that
i
have
here
--
or
the
bootblack
has
to
stop
at
11:00
in
the
morning.
now,
as
i
said,
this
--
if
your
honors
would
--
will
take
the
--
the
hard
task
of
reading
the
statute,
i
am
confident
that
you'll
come
to
the
same
conclusion
that
judges
magruder
and
woodbury
came
through
that
it's
an
unbelievable
hodgepodge
that
there's
no
rhyme
or
reason
to
any
logical
purpose
that
this
act
is
supposed
to
serve
to
have
this
sort
of
thing.
you
will
find
on
page
--
pages
49,
50
and
51,
we
have
listed
dozens
of
things
that
are
permitted,
some
of
which
were
absolutely
without
any
explanation.
my
brother
has
tried
to
hazard
some,
taking
judge
mccarthy's
view
that
digging
of
clams
is
an
amusement
and
not
work
as
one
who's
dug
clams,
i
can
testify
it's
work.
however,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
judge
mccarthy
wasn't
quite
right
on
his
--
his
--
on
the
culture
of
our
country.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
clams
one
of
the
big
commercial
industries
at
my
state.
you
drive
along
in
the
summer
time
there
you
can't
throw
a
rock
without
hitting
the
shoreline,
a
--
a
place
that
would
sell
steamed
clams
to
the
passerby.
it
is
true
that
it
can
be
done
by
--
by
an
amateur
such
as
myself
occasionally,
but
it's
a
commercial
operation
and
sea
clams
are
dredged
just
as
oysters
are
dredged
and
not
only
are
they
dredged
but
they're
seeded
and
this
is
a
big
business
in
massachusetts,
the
seeding
of
clams.
so
that
this
attempt
to
explain
that
the
digging
of
clams
is
alright
because
of
some
idea
that
people
--
individual
people
like
to
do
it,
comes
back
to
an
a
--
the
only
agreement
that
i
know
between
mr.
elcock
and
myself
on
some
of
the
fundamentals
of
this
case.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
suppose
we
will
run
into
that.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
we
will
run
into
that,
i
think,
mr.
justice,
if
you
do
not
find
that
it
is
a
--
statute
to
enforce
a
religious
holiday.
if
you
find
that,
you'll
be
through.
now,
if
you
find
that
it
is
a
day
of
rest
statute,
i
cannot
agree
more
heartily
with
you.
you
then
go
through
it
seems
to
me,
the
process
which
this
court
has
labored
with
so
often
of
weighing
the
damage
that
is
done,
the
interference
with
the
liberties,
the
interference
with
business,
with
the
purpose
for
which
the
statute
is
passed.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
comes
only
on
the
second,
that's
correct.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
shouldn't
think
so.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
mr.
justice
black,
i
would
say
that
massachusetts
courts
have
almost
universally
held
exactly
the
opposite,
except
for
one
case.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
is
correct
and
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
--
the
has
--
the
chernock
case
simply
cited
the
has
case
without
any
reexamination.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
but
between
the
has
case
and
the
chernock
case,
there
were
a
large
number
of
decisions
holding
that
this
was
a
religious
statute
and
the
--
the
has
case
was
a
maverick
decision.
now,
this
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
they
had
--
they
didn't
really
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes,
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
examine
in
the
light
of
their
own
decisions.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
they
didn't
use
the
word,
“religion.”
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
they
did
not
put
it
that
way.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
exactly.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
correct
and
they
--
in
our
brief,
we've
given
a
number
of
the
preambles
that
were
approved
by
our
court
after
the
commonwealth
against
has
decision
and
also
in,
i
think,
one
of
the
briefs
filed
here,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
i
think,
every
preamble
is
given
which
was
approved
on.
the
only
--
the
thing
that
is
raised
by
mr.
justice
black's
question
is
whether
or
not,
merely
calling
a
statute
a
civil
regulation
makes
itself.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
now,
we
still
have
to
look
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
it's
not
a
construction.
the
three-judge
court
followed
implicitly
the
construction
of
this
statute
and
its
interpretation.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
say
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
quite
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
quite
--
quite
agree.
and
the
three-judge
court
stated
that
they
follow
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
is
its
meaning
implicitly,
as
laid
down
by
our
supreme
court.
they
did
not
follow
the
characterization
of
the
statute
in
commonwealth
against
has.
they
preferred
to
follow
the
characterization
of
the
statute
as
contained
in
all
of
the
other
decisions
and
they
so
state
it.
they
--
they
had
a
choice
of
taking
the
commonwealth
against
has,
which
was
a
--
an
out
of
hand
decision
without
any
consideration
really,
of
the
statute
itself.
and
they
preferred
to
take
the
well-reasoned
decisions
that
run
over
125
years,
as
to
what
the
statute
was
and
they
stated
that
it
was
a
mere
characterization
which
of
course,
one
has
to
respect,
but
is
not
binding.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
what
is
left
of
the
statute
and
there's
not
much
left
of
it
any
more
if
your
honors
will
see,
is
still
devoted
to
the
original
purpose
because
the
purpose
has
not
been
changed.
there's
no
legislative
declaration.
there's
no
declaration
anywhere
that's
been
changed.
all
that's
happened
is
that
activities
are
now
permitted
on
the
seventh
day,
which
were
not
permitted
before.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
perhaps
not
your
honor,
but
as
my
duty
as
representing
the
clients
that
i
represent
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
--
is
to
limit
myself
to
the
facts
of
this
case
in
the
massachusetts
statute.
involved
in
that
of
course,
is
a
discussion
of
some
of
the
-
the
more
general
principles.
they
will
be
pursued
i
suppose,
in
greater
detail
in
some
of
the
other
cases
which
differ
from
ours,
but
i
don't
believe
in
this
case
that
it
is
necessary
to
go
that
far
afield,
because
we
have
here
a
very
peculiar
statute
that
started
as
a
religious
statute
and
remains
a
religious
statute.
now,
my
brother
elcock
stated
that
the
--
we
claim
the
classifications
are
arbitrary
and
that
therefore,
it
is
taking
of
property
and
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
i
don't
believe
it's
worthwhile
pursuing
the
classifications
in
view
of
what
i
was
going
to
state
was
an
agreement
between
mr.
elcock
and
ourselves.
we
stated
in
our
brief
and
the
three-judge
court
also
stated
the
majority
opinion
that
these
exceptions
apparently
represent
the
successful
operation
of
pressure
on
the
legislature
by
particular
groups.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
is
what
happens
[laughter].
not
only
is
not
unusual,
but
it's
universal,
i
would
say.
for
instance
tobacco;
tobacco
may
be
sold
on
sunday
provided
that
the
newsdealer
sells
tobacco
all
the
other
days
of
the
week.
now
how
tobacco
can
be
a
health
measure
in
view
of
scientific
discoveries
today
or
why
it
should
be
sold
on
the
seventh
day
instead
--
in
addition
to
the
other
six
days
is
another
mystery.
now,
what
my
brother
has
said
is
that
--
that
these
exceptions
are
the
result
of
the
successful
operation
of
different
groups
and
we
have
said
the
same
thing
and
the
three-judge
court
by
its
majority
decision,
said
the
same
thing.
now,
doesn't
that
remove
from
many
of
these
rather
odd
things
that
we
see
here,
most
of
the
contentions
that
they
--
they're
based
upon
some
rational
basis
when
we
--
when
submitted
that
they
are
based
merely
upon
those
who
are
successful
in
getting
the
legislature
--
legislation
passed.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
that
is
quite
true
and
that
isn't
exactly
what
i
intended
to
convey
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
because
here,
[laughter]
here,
we
have
these
--
these
odd
things
that
are
hard
to
explain.
for
instance
on
mr.
elcock's
brief,
he
tries
to
explain
6
o'clock
to
10
o'clock
in
the
morning
for
selling
kosher
meats
on
the
basis
that
state
inspectors
of
meat,
they
don't
want
to
work
them
too
hard.
they
--
they
want
to
give
them
a
little
rest.
well,
if
any
state
inspectors
visit
a
butcher
shop
more
than
once
a
month
in
massachusetts,
i
would
be
surprised.
but
even
so,
why
would
they
prefer
to
get
there
at
6
o'clock
in
the
morning
rather
than
to
come
along
leisurely
at
12
o'clock
or
1
o'clock?
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
that's
quite
--
quite
true,
some
people
may,
but
i
don't
think
that
--
it's
an
assumption
that
we
can
make,
not
on
sunday
morning,
at
least
as
to
most
of
us
--
because
we
have
to
draw
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
shouldn't
think
so.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
could
be
so,
certainly
and
we
have
to
look
at
the
entire
statute.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
right
and
we
have
to
--
in
this
connection,
in
the
--
those
great
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
relative
to
the
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights,
to
weigh
what
--
what
purpose
is
being
served,
what
--
what
police
purpose
is
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
is
so
important
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
the
--
the
first
amendment
right
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
first
amendment
right
is
--
is
a
freedom
of
religion
instead.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
oh,
i
see.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well
now,
we
come
down
to
the
question
of
taking
property
without
due
process
of
law
and
-
and
equal
protection
in
the
sense
of
the
statute
itself.
i
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
didn't
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
didn't
intend
to.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
right.
i
didn't
intend
to.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
the
exceptions
are
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
quite
right,
quite
right.
i
--
i
didn't
need
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
not
so
far
as
orthodox
jews
are
concerned.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
mr.
--
mr.
justice
brennan
called
my
attention
to
the
fact
that
i
may
have
glided
over.
i
may
have
glided
over
the
--
the
fact
that
a
--
the
selection
of
sunday
as
a
day
of
rest,
if
it
is
a
day
of
rest,
could
be
an
intrusion
on
the
religious
liberties
of
these
orthodox
jews
and
seventh-day
adventists,
because
the
very
--
the
very
purpose
of
selecting
sunday,
a
day
which
is
already
observed
by
people
of
other
faiths
as
a
day
of
rest
and
as
a
day
of
sanctity
in
and
of
itself,
subjects
the
orthodox
jews
and
seventh-day
adventists
to
heavy
penalty,
so
that
the
religious
question
is
still
there,
even
if
the
statute
should
be
regarded
as
a
day
of
rest.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
yes.
without
--
without
being
an
exception
for
those
who
observe
another
day
as
--
as
the
sabbath.
with
that
exception
in
--
the
--
the
difficulty
is
removed
on
that
basis
and
judge
magruder
pointed
that
out
in
his
decision.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
no
--
so
far
as
i
know,
no
religious
sect
observes
monday
and
i
think
that
while
it's
incredible
to
think
of
a
--
of
a
modern
legislature
establishing
monday
as
a
--
a
weekly
day
of
rest,
i'm
sure
no
religious
question
would
be
involved,
because
there
would
be
no
disadvantage
in
any
particular
sect.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
think
perhaps,
i'd
rather
come
back
in
the
morning.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
and
use
the
rest
of
the
10
minutes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
utilize
the
few
moments
at
my
disposal
for
rapid
summary
of
the
position
of
the
plaintiffs.
now
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
claim
that
the
lords
day
act
of
massachusetts
is
unconstitutional
as
an
invasion
of
first
amendment
rights
for
three
reasons.
first,
that
it
is
a
--
an
act
to
enforce
observance
of
sunday
as
the
lords
day
and
second,
oh,
at
this
--
at
this
point,
i
would
like
to
answer
more
specifically
mr.
justice
black's
question
which
i
didn’t
quite
grasp
yesterday.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
fact
that
commonwealth
against
has,
has
called
it
a
civil
regulation
is
binding
on
this
court
not
only
because
it's
at
variance
with
all
the
other
decisions,
but
because
it
matters
involving
basic
constitutional
rights.
this
court
is
not
bound
by
state
court
characterizations
of
the
purpose
of
the
act
but
we'll
look
at
its
actual
effect.
we
have
cited
several
cases
on
our
brief
and
many
cases
not
cited
for
that
specific
purpose
nevertheless
bear
out
the
same
proposition.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
--
that
i
think,
is
--
society
for
savings
against
bowers,
i
believe
is
--
is
one
of
those
cases,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
the
--
well,
the
later
cases
do
not
quite
say
that.
now,
the
--
the
very
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
very
late
cases
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
also
hold
it's
a
religious
act.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
say
there's
a
conflict
in
--
in
the
decisions.
many
later
cases
hold
that
it
is
an
act
to
enforce
observance
as
a
law.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
but
neither
characterization
would
be
binding
on
this
court
because
the
--
the
--
it's
the
substance
of
the
act
and
its
effect
that
will
determine
what
this
court
feels
about
it.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
also
called
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
the
lords
day
act
intentionally
selected
a
day
in
which
the
majority
of
people
already
abstain
from
work
and
that
in
the
language
of
judge
magruder,
it
gave
special
protection
to
the
majority
of
faith
and
did
not
give
the
same
protection
to
minority
faiths
that
believed
in
the
seventh
day
as
the
sabbath.
and
third
and
this
bears
on
the
question
i
think,
mr.
justice
brennan,
asked
me
yesterday.
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
the
invasion
of
basic
first
amendment
rights
is
alleged
and
there's
no
question
but
that
the
interference
is
serious
and
the
damage
is
great.
to
justify
that
requires
a
compelling
reason
and
there
is
an
absence
of
such
a
compelling
reason
in
this
case.
we're
not
talking
about
a
day
of
rest
because
there's
no
question
but
that
the
--
the
state
could
establish
a
day
of
rest.
this
is
a
question
of
whether
everybody
must
abstain
from
work
on
the
same
day.
now,
we
have
no
evidence
that
in
this
modern
world
with
all
of
its
complications,
that
that
is
a
compelling
reason.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
--
the
scores
of
exceptions
in
this
act
themselves
indicate
that
that's
a
wholly
impracticable
thing.
so
that
when
this
court
comes
to
consider
it,
the
third
ground
based
upon
--
the
discussions
and
considerations
that
this
court
has
given
in
leading
cases
such
as
schneider
against
irvington
and
other
cases,
you'll
come
to
the
question
of
weighing
whether
or
not,
the
necessity
for
everybody
resting
on
the
same
day,
if
it
ever
could
be
accomplished,
is
so
compelling
that
these
plaintiffs
should
be
forced
because
of
their
religion
and
because
of
the
law,
to
lose
52
days
for
one
reason
and
52
days
for
another,
during
the
course
of
the
year.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
it
would
not
be
objectionable
if
it
contained
the
same
provision
that
we
are
urging
in
this
case
namely,
that
those
who
abstain
from
work
on
another
day
would
be
--
not
be
compelled
to
abstain
on
that
day.
and
i
say
that
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
because
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
the
difficulty
is
that
it
would
favor
the
atheist,
unless
it
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
it
would
favor
the
atheist
unless
there
was
an
exception
for
those
who
observed
another
day.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
and
in
a
complicated
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
society
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
because
the
atheist
would
then
be
--
if
--
if
the
atheist
would
work
seven
days
--
would
--
would
work
six
days
a
week
and
lose
one
day,
those
who
observe
their
religion
piously,
would
lose
two
days
a
week.
now
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
and
that's
the
only
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
they
would
get
hurt,
yes.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that's
the
only
complication.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
and
on
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
i
have
difficulty
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
have
difficulty
with
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
--
some
of
these
hypothetical
cases,
the
legislature
in
these
matters
of
religion
and
sometimes
color
and
politics
are
--
are
possibly
poor
vehicles
to
assert
the
rights
of
minorities.
we
have
seen
that
in
-
in
many
cases.
the
--
the
case
of
the
products
with
carolene
products
case,
which
mr.
justice
stone
emphasized
that
fact
that
there
are
cases
in
which
the
legislature
--
you
cannot
expect
much
relief
because
they
represent
a
dominant
majority
opinion.
i
do
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
pardon?
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
--
i
feel
that
in
matters
of
economics
and
regulation
of
business,
that
that
sort
of
thing
does
not
occur,
but
in
--
in
matters
touching
racial
prejudice
or
religious
preferences
or
anything
of
that
sort,
it's
a
different
situation.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
no,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far.
i
think
that
--
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
--
i
am
not
so
lacking
in
knowledge
of
my
own
limitations
as
to
guide
this
court,
but
i
do
say
that
the
decisions
which
are
guides
to
me
in
this
course
--
in
this
court
such
as
schneider
against
--
the
schneider
case
i
mentioned
and
the
barnett
case
and
other
cases
are
guides.
and
those
guides
say
that
there
must
be
--
where
there's
a
serious
interference
with
first
amendment
rights,
there
must
be
some
compelling
reason
for
it.
and
we
have
not
been
furnished
with
any
such
reason
here,
the
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
brother
here
says
that
most
people
already
observe
sunday,
so
that
the
question
which
should
be
answered
is
as
one
of
the
justices
said
yesterday,
is
that
the
criminal
law
now
needs
it
for
this
purpose.
i'm
reminded
of
the
progressive
school
child
who
asked
the
teacher,
“teacher,
do
we
have
to
do
today
the
things
we
want
to
do?”
this
is
--
they
do
it
anyway.
so
that
the
question
confronting
us
is
whether
or
not,
the
criminal
law
has
justification
for
forcing
people
who
are
already
observing
the
seventh
day
to
also
observe
the
--
the
seventh
day
to
also
observe
the
first
day
and
there's
no
such
reason.
now,
if
i'm
--
i
would
like
now
to
pass
on
to
--
to
pass
--
to
--
oh,
i
should
add
this,
which
is
also
a
part
of
the
question
and
that
is
that
if
there
are
alternatives,
even
if
there
was
some
need
for
it,
but
if
there
were
alternatives
that
imposition
will
not
be
placed
upon
the
--
those
who
observe
the
seventh
day
as
the
sabbath
and
in
this
instance,
there
are
such
alternatives.
there
is
for
instance
an
exemption
as
an
alternative
for
those
who
observe
the
seventh
day.
there's
also
the
one
day
of
rest
in
--
in
the
seventh,
which
is
becoming
more
the
universal
statute
relating
to
hours
of
labor.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
see
the
red
light
is
shown.
there
are
some
subjects
that
i
haven't
--
one
subject
i
haven't
touched
on
yet
and
--
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
well,
i
--
i
had
intended
to
go
into
the
question
of
due
process.
we
have
here
a
--
a
statute
which
i
hope
that
will
be
studied
because
it
has
such
--
so
many
instances
where
the
--
the
declared
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
my
brother
has
stated
that
namely,
for
a
day
of
rest,
is
not
carried
out
appropriately
by
the
statute.
let
us
take
the
very
--
the
very
clause
we're
talking
about
now
that
--
that
this
crown
kosher
market
may
--
open
at
6
o'clock
and
if
it
provided,
it
closes
at
10
o'clock
on
sunday.
whose
rest
is
being
promoted
by
that?
isn't
that
a
completely
inappropriate
law
if
it
supposed
to
induce
a
day
of
rest?
so
far
as
the
public
are
concerned,
if
they're
disturbed
by
a
shop
--
shop
at
all,
certainly
they'll
be
disturbed
between
6
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
a
sunday
and
10
o'clock.
if
we're
taking
about
the
employees
of
the
store,
they
not
only
have
already
been
off
on
saturday,
but
why
should
they
get
up
at
5
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
get
there
at
6
o'clock
in
the
morning,
in
order
to
preserve
their
own
rest?
and
then
they
have
to
quit
at
10
o'clock
and
after
that,
they
can
--
they
can
engage
as
they
wish
and
anyone
of
40
or
50
things
that
these
exemptions
allow
to
drive
a
--
drive
a
taxi,
push
carts,
anything.
mr.
herbert
b.
ehrmann
they
can
go
back
to
sleep
again
[laughter].
now,
there
--
there
is
still
a
further
illustration.
mr.
chernock
under
this
statute
could
take
a
pushcart,
if
he
could
get
the
license
by
the
municipal
authorities
and
sell
these
kosher
meats
all
day
long
on
sunday,
but
he
can't
go
indoors
and
sell
it
from
a
shop.
now,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
rest
if
he
would
tire
himself
up
by
12
hours
going
up
and
down
the
street
with
a
pushcart?
he
could
do
it
under
the
statute.
you've
got
the
strange
--
the
strange
situation
where
a
baker
may
sell
bread
from
his
store
but
he
can't
deliver
it,
but
a
kosher
market
can
only
sell
in
--
in
limited
hours,
but
he
can
deliver
it
all
day
long.
the
--
the
reason
for
this
--
for
these
things
is
not
--
we
can't
blame
the
massachusetts
legislature,
if
your
honor
please,
they
are
attempting
an
impossible
task.
they
are
taking
an
old
statute
passed
to
enforce
reverence
for
the
law
--
for
the
lords
day
and
they're
trying
to
work
into
it
accommodations
for
a
modern
society
and
it
just
can't
be
done.
