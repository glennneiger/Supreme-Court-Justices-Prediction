justice
john
m.
harlan
but
on
your
establishment
of
religious
--
religious
points,
don't
you
ultimately,
have
to
face
up
to
the
question
that
justice
black
put
to
you,
namely
whether
the
state
has
got
power
to
pass
a
day
of
rest
statute?
because
surely,
our
duty
in
construing
a
state
statute,
granted
everything
that
you
say,
is
to
save
this
statute
if
we
can
do
it
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
me,
you'll
have
to
face
up
to
that
basic
question
as
to
whether
the
state
has
got
the

right
to
prescribe
a
day
of
rest.

only
comes
on
your
second
point.
justice
john
m.

not
on
the
establishment
of
religion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
house
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
whom
do
you
say
did
the
argument
the
statute
(inaudible)
refers?
it
talked
on
the
subject
of
