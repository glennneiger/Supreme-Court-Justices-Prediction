mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
make
a
distinction
between
--
between
religious
rights
and
--
and
religious
observance?
the
--
the
point
i
make
is
--
is
this,
i
am
not
quite
clear
how
they
allege
that
keeping
open
on
sunday
interfered
with
their
religious
observances.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then,
they
suffer
an
economic
loss
rather
than
the
loss
of
--
of
religious
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
observance.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
your
point?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ehrmann.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
year
was
that,
mr.
ehrmann?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
couples
--
he
couples
that
with
the
interpretation
of
the
supreme
court,
doesn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
don't
let
me
interrupt
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ehrmann,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
i
think
about
10,
would
you
rather
finish
tonight
or
would
you
rather
come
back
in
the
morning?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
adjourn,
now.

gallagher,
chief
of
police
of
the
city
of
springfield,
massachusetts,
et
al.,
appellants,
versus
crown
kosher
super
market
of
massachusetts.
mr.
ehrmann,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
should
we
at
the
same
time,
disregard
all
the
earlier
cases
which
hold
that
this
was
a
religious
act
as
well
as
the
later
ones
which
say
that
it's
an
--
it's
a
lay
act?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
house
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
the
house
case
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ehrmann,
i
wonder
if
they
selected
a
day
that
--
on
which
there
was
no
religious
observance
of
any
kind,
let
--
let's
say
that
thursday
would
be
such
--
such
a
day
and
there's
a
--
in
their
one
day
of
rest
statute,
they
selected
a
thursday.
would
that
in
your
opinion,
be
objectionable?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
but
i'm
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
question
i
pose
was
whether
they
should
say
thursday
shall
be
the
day
of
--
of
rest.
anyone
could
rest
any
other
day
that
they
want,
but
--
but
that
shall
be
a
day
of
rest
when
business
shall
close.
now,
leaving
out
the
religious
day,
would
that
in
your
opinion,
be
valid?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
would
it
favor
the
atheist?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
never
get
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they
would
get
hurt?
chief
justice
earl
warren
economically.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
isn't
that
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
a
matter
for
the
legislature
to
determine?
chief
justice
earl
warren
(voice
overlap)
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
state
it
if
you
--
if
you
wish,
just
what
is
--
but
we
will
observe
the
time,
otherwise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
elcock,
your
time
has
expired
but
the
last
few
minutes
of
your
argument
were
taken
up
by
questions.
if
you
should
like
to
take
say,
four
minutes
to
sum
up
your
argument?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
is
it
have
not
(inaudible)
do,
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
