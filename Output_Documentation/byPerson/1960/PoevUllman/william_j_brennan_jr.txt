well,
if
--
if
that's
so,
mr.
harper,
that's
independent
then
of
any
special
circumstances
healthwise
or
otherwise,
applicable
of
these
--
through
these
plaintiffs,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cannon,
may
i
ask.
you
suggested
earlier,
i
think,
that
there
may
be
a
sale
in
connecticut
of
contraceptives
without
violating
the
statute
provided
the
sale
is
for
the
prevention
of
disease.
is
that
fact
under
your
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
--
are
you
familiar
with
what
mr.
harper
told
us
about,
namely,
the
opinion,
i
think,
he
said
in
the
attorney
general
of
connecticut?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
sells.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
what
you're
--
what
you're
telling
me
then
is
that
the
law
of
connecticut
is
that
a
sale
for
the
purpose
of
prevention
of
disease
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
cannon,
am
i
wrong?
aren't
there
some
states
abortion
statutes,
well,
to
make
abortion
a
crime,
which
don't
provide
an
exception
that
even
where
the
abortion
is
performed
to
save
lives?
