are
there
other
statutes
just
like
this
statute
in
other
states?
justice

do
you
--
does
your
argument
go
so
far
as
it
would
mean
that
a
state
violates
due
process
by
--
when
its
legislature
adopts
a
minority
view?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
now,
the
crux
of
that
phrase,
as
i
understand
it,
is
the
overwhelming
opinion
of
medical
authority.
would
not
the
state
legislature
have
the
right
to
differ
would
the
overwhelming
majority
opinion?
