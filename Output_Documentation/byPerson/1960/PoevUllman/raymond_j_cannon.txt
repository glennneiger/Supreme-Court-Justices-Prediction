mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
may
it
please
the
court.
to
further
extend
the
review
of
this
situation,
it's
been
pointed
out
the
act
was
passed
in
1879.
and
since
then,
it
has
been
maintained
on
the
books
and
enacted
by
and
reenacted
by
legislature
when
they
have
adopted
various
provisions
of
the
statute
since
that
date.
when
these
cases
first
were
brought
to
my
attention,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
problem
had
been
conclusively
resolved
by
the
cases
of
state
versus
nelson
decided
in
1940
and
tileston
versus
ullman
in
1942.
both
of
those
cases,
and
particularly
the
nelson
case,
i
believe,
prevented
or
presented
situations
exactly
as
they
appear
here
on
the
claims
of
poe
and
doe.
the
court
--
our
supreme
court
of
errors
also
indicated
in
the
nelson
case
the
fact
that,
and
discussed
it
at
some
length,
that
since
1923,
there
have
been
periodical
attempts
to
have
this
law
changed
or
modified.
and
that
every
session
of
the
legislature
which
meets
two
years
--
every
two
years
since
1923
up
to
and
through
as
pointed
out
in
the
decision
in
the
present
cases,
there
has
been
bills
presented
of
varying
types
before
the
legislature,
some
requesting
repeal
of
the
statute
or
modification
of
it.
there
have
been
any
number
of
statutes
and
these
are
indicated
in
the
notes
and
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
and
contained
in
the
record
in
the
poe
and
ullman
case
in
the
opinion
filed
by
the
court.
now,
i
guess
no
one
can
argue
that
the
legislature
doesn't
have
the
right
to
enact
statutes
which
pertain
to
the
field
of
moral.
in
the
nelson
case,
the
court
indicated
that
this
did
involve
public
morals
and
because
of
that
fact,
they
felt
that
even
though
it
might
have
restricted
the
use
of
contraceptives
in
some
instances,
nevertheless,
if
that
be
deemed
liberty
which
these
people
were
entitled
to
have,
the
legislature,
nevertheless,
acting
for
the
general
good,
had
the
right
to
make
it
--
the
prohibition
absolute.
this
also
has
been
a
very
controversial
problem
in
connecticut,
but
that's
been
indicated
at
all
the
sessions
and
all
the
hearings
that
had
before
the
legislature
over
the
period
of
years.
i
might
point
out
that
in
connecticut,
the
house
of
representatives
--
there
are
two
from
each
town,
they're
elected
territorially,
two
from
each
town
having
a
population
of
5000
or
more.
so,
a
town
with
5500
people
could
have
two
representatives
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
whereas
the
city
of
hartford
has
180,000
people
still
has
two,
but
the
senators
are
elected
on
the
population
basis.
most
of
these
bills
have
been
turned
down
in
the
senate
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
and
the
problems
which
are
here
today
presented
have
been
presented
to
the
legislature,
the
medical
problems,
the
public
health
problems
and
the
fact
that
--
and
the
religious
problems,
too.
now
--
the
religious
beliefs.
under
their
briefs,
as
i
read
them,
submitted,
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
arguing
that
these
laws
did
in
fact
represent
the
minority
view
of
the
connecticut
people.
our
supreme
court
said
that
after
all
these
attempts,
obviously,
would
seem
to
be
to
represent
the
will
of
the
people.
there
are
factors
now
present
before
the
present
session
of
legislature,
another
bill
to
modify
this
legislation,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
learned
hand,
in
discussing
a
similar
case
involving
some
--
of
the
one
package
case,
he
said
people's
minds
change
in
relation
to
these
subjects
or
use
of
contraceptives.
and
the
statute
that
they
were
discussing
at
that
time
was
also
--
no
statute
past
in
neighborhood
of
1879.
but
in
that
case
he
said,
"the
statute
now
forbids
the
same
conduct
that
it
prohibited
when
originally
enacted.
it
takes
time
for
people
to
a
public
opinion,
to
jell,
to
get
enough
force
behind
it,
to
cause
their
changes.
it
is
our
view
that
most
of
the
arguments
that
are
presented
here
are
sociological
or
physiological,
that
they
should
belong
in
--
in
proper
places
before
the
legislature,
not
before
this
court.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it's
the
one
package
case,
i
guess
you
--
your
honor
please.
united
states
versus
one
package,
86
f.2d

--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon

f.2d.
737.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
look
like
--
i
had
it
like
this,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
it
is
our
view,
if
it
may
please
your
honor,
that
it
is
the
problem
primarily
for
the
legislature
to
determine
what
is
the
greater
good
and
how
to
accomplish
the
greater
good.
there,
perhaps,
isn't
a
very
few
statutes
in
the
police
power
that
they
do
not
hurt
somebody
at
sometime
or
another.
but
there
is
no
authority
that
i
know
of
that
that
in
and
of
itself
is
sufficient
ground
to
hold
a
statute
which
is
otherwise
constitutional
--
unconstitutional.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
plus
this
other
added
feature,
if
i
may.
of
course,
when
she
seeks
this
advice
under
the
allegations
of
this
complaint,
she's
not
then
and
there
suffering
from
any
disease
which
affects
her
health.
they
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
it's
necessary
to
have,
because
of
their
marital
status,
continued
sexual
intercourse
and
that
dr.
buxton
knows
the
best
method
whereby
conception
might
be
prevented.
so
at
that
time,
when
she
consults
dr.
buxton,
pregnancy
does
not
enter
into
the
picture.
she
has
a
choice
then.
he
can
advise
here
and
probably
did
advise
her
that
for
you
to
become
pregnant,
will,
probably,
result
in
serious
consequences.
there
are
a
number
of
situations,
the
health
situations
where
we
have
resulting
of
those
type
particularly
in
persons
with
ulcers
or
gallbladder
and
doctors
prevent
the
use
of
food.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
medical
advice.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
we
don't
prevent
him
either.
he
has
the
right
to
tell
her
that
a
future
pregnancy
might
cause
her
trouble.
but
he
can't
tell
her
or
advise
her
under
the
statute
to
use
contraceptives
or
artificial
contraceptives
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
conception.
now,
while
we're
in
the
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
mr.
justice,
i
don't
--
this
case
here,
she's
not
been
at
the
time
pregnant
whereas,
on
the
supposition,
the
client
or
the
patient
does
have
the
appendicitis.
that
is
the
point
in
the
supreme
court
or
our
supreme
court
indicated
that,
too,
in
discussing
a
phase
of
this.
that
although
it
might
be
considered
a
species
of
treatment,
it's
in
the
nature
of
advice
because
the
patient
then
and
there
is
not
suffering
from
any
condition
which
he
needs
this
particular
advice
to
use
contraceptives.
it
would
be
a
condition
which
might
flow
from
the
basic
bill
health.
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
this
time
also
that
the
demurrer
admits
the
allegations
and
the
complaint,
of
course,
and
there
--
that's
on
the
basis
of
the
nelson
and
tileston
cases.
but
despite
that
fact,
there
is
medical
authority
to
the
contrary
of
all
these
allegations
and
substantial
medical
authority.
the
fact
that
there's
proper
ways
to
prevent
conception
through
the
natural
means
which
they
call
rhythm
and
--
but
i
do
not
think
--
we
hold
that
is
not
for
this
court
to
conduct
an
investigation
as
to
what
is
the
proper
or
improper
way
to
do
it.
that
is
the
legislature's
problem.
so
long
as
this
court
is
aware
of
the
fact
that
there's
two
views
and
it's
a
highly
controversial
issue,
our
supreme
court
in
both
--
in
all
three
cases,
i
believe,
that
it
has
noted
it's
a
highly
controversial
issue
in
connecticut
and
the
legislature
has
adopted
one
system.
the
legislature
is
free
to
adopt
whichever
system
it
sees
fit
provided
it's
reasonable
for
the
purpose
at
which
the
law
is
intended.
now,
there's
--
there's
contrary
medical
advice
to
all
the
arguments
or
facts
that
have
been
presented
here
this
afternoon.
i
have
noted
in
my
brief,
may
it
please
the
court,
some
statistics
from
the
medical
society
in
connecticut.
the
connecticut
medical
society
has
a
committee
to
investigate
all
maternal
deaths
and
they
filed
a
five-year
report.
the
last
report
which
they
filed
covered
the
years
1951
through
1955.
and
that
five-year
period,
there
were
75
maternal
deaths
in
connecticut
with
all
thousands
of
children
that
were
born.
they
go
further
than
that,
this
committee
of
the
medical
society
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
they
say
out
that
--
out
of
those
75%,
65%
could
have
been
avoided,
had
the
patient
had
proper
medical
care
or
had
the
patient
had
taken
care
of
herself
and
followed
doctor's
order.
even
dr.
guttmacher,
who
is
chairman
of
the
medical
section
of
the
plan
federation
of
america,
i
believe
it
was
in
august,
i
also
mentioned
this
in
the
brief
that
in
august
of
1960,
dr.
guttmacher
was
featured
in
an
article
which
advocated
a
relaxation
and
an
extension
of
the
abortion
laws
in
the
various
states
in
the
country.
and
he
said
there,
"because
of
that
article,"
that
was
a
quotation,
in
view
of
the
advancements
made
by
medical
profession
in
the
last
20
years,
"it
is
now
very
--
very
rare
to
require
or
have
an
abortion
on
a
mother
because
of
a
serious
heart,
lung
or
kidney
disease.
it
is
a
very,
very
rare
situation
today."
the
doctors
and
the
doctors
in
connecticut
probably
--
this
statute
may
or
may
not
have
had
something
to
do
with
it,
but
the
fact
is
that
when
they
are
confronted
with
situations
like
this
and
they
know
the
wishes
and
wants
of
people,
that
progress
is
made
and
the
doctor
who
filed
that
report
said
that
connecticut,
i
think
it
ranked
about
15
or
a
5-year
period
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
deaths
in
the
state,
but
they
are
fast,
quickly
in
reaching
irreducible
minimum
of
maternal
deaths
of
--
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
my
argument
is
--
i
cited
that
simply
for
the
purpose
of
contravening
some
of
the
medical
statistics
were
then
advanced
by
the
appellants
here
to
show
that
the
situation
is
not
as
grave
as
it
might
seem
at
first
blush.
and
that
they
have,
to
a
great
extent,
harbored
many
of
the
problems
that
are
involved
in
pregnancy
situation.
so
that
that
--
that
there
are
two
sides
to
the
medical
problem
involved
and
it
being
a
controversial
issue,
the
state
of
connecticut
through
the
legislature
so
--
so
that
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
they
bear
indirectly,
if
i
may
please
your
honor,
in
this
respect
because
i
have
quoted
a
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
very
few,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes.
but
there
must
--
in
those
figures,
there
must
be
several
many,
with
comparable
situations
such
as
--
set
out
by
poe
and
doe
because
they
were
the
same
physical
conditions
portrayed
in
the
nelson
and
tileston
cases.
and
the
medical
profession
years
ago
would
say
that
a
pregnancy
would
be
quite
dangerous
to
a
mother
suffering
with
serious
heart,
lung
or
kidney
complications.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
can't
subscribe
to
that,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
--
i
would
perhaps
have
to
confess
that
there
are
people
that
are
not
probably
as
scrupulous
as
poe
and
doe
or
alleged
to
be.
we
find
that
in
every
field.
i
might
point
out
the
motor
vehicle
regulation,
the
speeding
laws
and
things
of
that
type
are
violated,
but
that
is
no
reason
why
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
challenge
both
statements
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
--
because
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
have
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
have
given
these
figures,
your
honor,
to
show
that
there
is
a
controversial
problem.
i've
given
these
figures
to
show
that
they
were
presented
time
after
time
before
the
legislature.
now,
if
the
legislature
made
no
change
in
the
law,
overall
the
period
of
these
years,
then
it
seems
to
be
natural
and
one
logical
that
won't
--
we
would
expect
that
under
our
system
of
government,
sooner
or
later,
after
all
these
years,
people
would
elect
representatives
who
would
represent
their
views.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
well,
i
--
i
--
if
your
honor
please,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
outside
power
in
connecticut
influencing
the
legislature.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
believe
it
does
reflect
the
majority
view
of
the
legislature.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
of
any
situation.
i
don't
know
how
that
can
be
reconciled
in
view
of
our
statutes.
there
are
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
yes,
i
--
your
honor,
i
--
it
wasn't
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general.
it
was
the
commissioner
personal
opinion
of
a
drug
and
food
commissioner.
and
when
i
mentioned
that
in
the
brief
and
when
mr.
harper
received
that
brief,
it
was
accompanied
by
a
letter
and
said
the
present
commissioner
does
not
subscribe
to
these
views.
the
question
was
never
presented
--
that
specific
problem
was
never
presented
to
our
office
for
an
opinion
by
--
on
a
sale
for
the
prevention
of
disease.
we
have
in
connecticut
a
statute
forbidding
fornication
as
a
crime
in
connecticut.
lascivious
carriage
is
a
crime.
adultery
is
a
crime.
we
have
a
statute
here
that
no
one,
the
one
in
question,
no
one
can
use
contraceptives
to
prevent
conception.
that
applies
to
married
and
unmarried
people.
now,
anybody
who
buys,
uses
a
contraceptive
device
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
--
or
sells
for
a
known
currently
use
is
an
accessory
to
the
crime
of
fornication
or
adultery
whichever
it
might
be,
if
it's
beyond
the
marriage
status.
but
if
it's
in
the
marriage
or
--
status,
why
this
--
they
are
also
included
into
this
law.
but
also
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
and
i
know
of
two
cases
that
happened
several
years
ago.
they
were
in
the
minor
police
courts
in
connecticut.
there
were
no
appeals
taken,
whereof
the
state
police
picked
up
in
ice
cream
marts,
vending
machines
for
selling
conceptives
or
contraceptives
and
they
were
arrested
and
represented.
they
were
in
different
parts
of
the
state.
and
no
appeals
from
those
cases
were
taken
and
they
were
represented
by
a
good
counsel,
we
thought.
and
i
--
i
--
in
view
of
the
fact
that
all
these
acts
are
forbidden,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
logical
that
one
could
urge
that
it's
proper
to
use
them
for
the
prevention
of
disease.
the
very
act
in
itself
is
forbidden,
it's
a
crime.
there's
no
law
or
decision
on
that
matter
other
than
the
ones
i
just
cited
that
i
know
of.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i
could
point
out
a
specific
case
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
--
in
law
or
menace.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
do
not
know.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
do
not
know,
justice.
i
haven't
explored
that
field.
but
in
--
in
this
case
here,
it's
--
similar
statutes
have
been
before
the
courts,
in
various
courts
of
new
jersey,
massachusetts,
new
york
and
then
on
the
federal
statute.
i
do
not
know
of
any
one
decision
which
even
intimates
the
statute
controlling
or
regulating
the
use
of
contraceptives
that
has
been
held
to
be
unconstitutional.
every
single
one
of
them
has
held
they're
constitutional.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
don't
know
--
i
--
i
wouldn't
quite
subscribe
to
it,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
because
i
would
say
on
the
freedom
of
speech
or
other
freedom
to
talk
or
that
sort,
i
don't
think
dr.
buxton
or
anyone
else
has
the
right
to
advise
some
person
to
avoid
a
law
which
is
otherwise
valid.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
--
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
say
so.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
because
the
statute
is
all
inclusive
or
permits
no
exceptions
and
it
has
been
held
by
our
supreme
court
of
connecticut
on
three
different
occasions
to
be
constitutional
and
within
the
police
power.
and
i
don't
believe
that
he
or
anyone
else
has
the
right
to
urge
a
violation
of
a
statute
which
is
properly
within
the
police
power.
he
certainly,
if
he
will
practice
--
practicing,
he
wouldn't
acquire
any
property
rights
and
fees
or
any
of
that
nature
advising
the
client
to
disregard
a
statute
and
do
what
is
forbidden
and
in
the
nature
of
a
crime,
i
think
the
same
would
apply
to
the
speech
factor
so
far
as
the
doctor
is
concerned.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
say
the
state
has
the
right
to
solve,
regulate
liberty
as
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
that's
correct.
i
say
free
speech
and
liberty
and
property
rights
are
in
the
same
basis,
that
if
it's
a
law,
it's
properly
enacted
to
safeguard
and
they
borrow
for
the
community.
and
that's
what
this
has
been
held
to
be
several
times.
then,
it's
a
proper
regulation
of
that
freedom
of
liberty
speech
or
--
or
it
doesn't
deprive
a
person
of
property
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
--
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
j.
cannon
thank
you.
