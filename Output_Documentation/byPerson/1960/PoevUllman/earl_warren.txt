chief

mr.
harper,
before
you
get
to
that,
i'd
like
to
follow
--
follow
that
up
a
little
more
of
the
question
that
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
you.
is
it
your
position
that
the
--
that
the
state
has
--
has
no
business
in
this
area
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that
--
that's
it,
but
they
have
no
business
in
it
at
all.
that
it's
--
it's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
only
unreasonable
that
they
should
--
that
they
should
attempt
to
--
to
exercise
any
--
any
control
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
in
this
area.
chief
justice

i
just
want
to
--
i
just
want
to
be
sure.
and
the
other
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief

ms.

chief
justice

warren
mr.
cannon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cannon,
may
i
ask
this
question
please?
if
--
if
this
diagnosis
of
mrs.
doe
is
accurate
and
if
her
life
is
to
be
endangered,
unless
she
asks
medical
advice
and
medical
--
medical
treatment,
do
you
--
do
you
believe
that
the
state
has
sufficient
interest
in
--
in
this
statute
in
enacting
the
statute
to
prevent
her
from
giving
that
necessary
medical
advice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
presuming
that
this
--
assuming
that
--
that
this
is
accurate
to
what
they
say
that
for
her
to
--
to
conceive
again,
would
be
exceedingly
perilous
to
life.
now,
if
that
is
accurate,
does
the
state
have
sufficient
interest
in
the
enactment
of
this
statute
to
prevent
her
from
getting
necessary
medical
advice?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that
--
that
lead
you
to
the
--
to
the
physician
that
even
if
it
was
conceded
by
all
that
this
lady
would
die
if
she
had
--
had
another
child
that
the
state
has
--
has
a
right
through
a
statute
of
this
--
this
kind
and
for
the
reasons
that
you
assigned
for
it
to
prevent
her
from
getting
medical
--
medical
care
knowing
that
she'll
die.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
that's
medical
--
that's
medical
advice
that
they're
giving
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
wouldn't
prevent
a
doctor
from
giving
that
kind
of
advice
certainly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
cannon
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
--
mr.
cannon,
may
i
ask
you
this
--
this
question?
do
you
know
or
can
you
point
out
for
us
any
comparable
situation
in
law
and
medicine
where
a
doctor
has
a
patient
whose
life
is
in
danger
and
who,
according
to
the
best
opinion
of
the
medical
profession,
needs
medical
advice
and
he
is
prohibit
--
that
is,
it
needs
medical
advice
to
protect
her
life
and
the
doctor
is
prevented
from
giving?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
yes,
i
don't
say
there
isn't
any
such
situation
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
but
i
just
don't
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
can't
conjure
up
one
in
my
own
mind
so
i
thought
i
would
(voice

chief
justice
earl

you
may
answer
that
in
the
morning.
