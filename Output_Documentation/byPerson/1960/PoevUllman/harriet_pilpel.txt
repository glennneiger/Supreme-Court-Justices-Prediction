ms.

may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
many
questions
of
death
and
disease
to
which
the
medical
profession
does
not
know
the
answer.
however,
these
cases
present
situations
where
the
medical
profession
in
the
person
of
dr.
buxton
does
know
the
answer.
however,
he
is
not
permitted
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
connecticut
to
give
the
answer
which
the
state
and
the
state
supreme
court
can
see,
as
medically
speaking,
the
best
and
safest
preventive
measure
for
the
plaintiffs
to
follow
in
order
to
avoid
pregnancy.
if
connecticut
had
passed
a
statute
forbidding
women
for
whom
a
pregnancy
was
counter
indicated
from
--
from
having
sex
relations,
we
submit
that
this
would
be
a
highly
unreasonable
enactment.
yet
that
is
precisely
the
effect
of
what
connecticut
has
done
in
these
cases.
in
each
of
these
cases,
connecticut
has
imposed
a
choice
upon
the
appellant
mrs.
doe
either
to
risk
death
or
renounced
all
marital
relations.
mrs.
poe,
to
produce
--
mr.
and
mrs.
poe
to
produce
more
monstrous
babies
incapable
of
survival
were
to
renounce
all
marital
relations.
and
dr.
buxton
perhaps
the
most
difficult
choice
of
all,
namely,
a
choice
between
what
he
concedes
to
be
his
professional
obligations,
which
i
will
show
in
a
moment,
is
the
overwhelming
consensus
of
medical
opinion
and
the
law
of
the
state
where
he
practice
his
medicine.
surely,
any
approach
to
this
problem
in
these
cases
is
as
professor
harper
has
said,
"to
burn
down
the
house
to
roast
the
pig"
and
especially
so,
since
there
are
our
aspects
of
these
cases
touching
upon
freedom
of
expression
and
freedom
of
religious
worship
which
tie
in
to
the
untroubled
unreasonableness.
the
state
has
not
attempted
to
justify
these
drastic
effects
on
the
appellants
beyond
making
generalizations
about
the
police
power.
and
that
this
court
has
said
in
an
earlier
case's
term,
generalities
expressing
the
state's
unrestricted
power
do
not
help
to
resolve
constitutional
issues.
it
is
my
hope
to
show
that
the
overwhelming
consensus
of
medical
opinions
supports
dr.
buxton's
claim
and
the
admission
of
the
appellees
and
the
finding
of
the
state
court
that
the
prescription
of
contraceptives
in
these
cases
is
medically
demanded.
we
submit
further
that
this
court
has
always
accorded
great
weight
to
medical
opinion
in
medical
matters
where
that
opinion
is,
as
here,
substantially
unanimous.
we
also
submit
that
traditionally,
neither
this
court,
nor
the
other
courts
to
whom
the
question
has
come
up
for
decision,
have
conceived
that
general
prohibitions,
constitutionally
apply
to
medical
practice
backed
by
substantial
consensus
of
medical
opinion,
as
professor
harper
indicated
that
connecticut
then
is
unique.
it
is
furthermore
totally
out
of
line
with
all
federal
and
state
legislative,
judicial
and
administrative
experience
in
this
field
with
the
possible
exception
of
massachusetts.
and
it
is
also
totally
out
of
line
with
the
balance
of
connecticut's
own
statutory
scheme
touching
on
the
general
subject
of
procreation.
in
other
words,
that
virtually
every
guard
close
this
court
looks
at
in
due
process
cases,
points
toward
the
invalidity
of
these
statutes
as
applied
to
these
appellants.
dr.
buxton's
opinion
is
amply
confirmed
by
all
the
data
available
with
reference
to
the
opinion
of
the
medical
profession
as
a
whole.
the
american
medical
association,
several
of
its
constituent
sections
including
the
section
on
obstetrics
and
gynecology,
which
is
the
section
here
involved
and
the
section
on
mental
and
nervous
diseases,
other
important
national
societies
like
the
american
gynecological
society
and
the
american
neurological
association
and
the
american
health
--
public
health
association,
medical
societies
of
various
states
including
the
medical
society
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
all
are
in
accord
that
in
this
type
of
case,
contraception,
meaning
the
prescription
of
drugs,
medicinal
articles
or
instruments
for
the
prevention
of
conception,
is
generally
recognized
as
a
necessary
and
proper
part
of
medical
practice.
this
fact
is
further
attested
too
by
the
authority
cited
in
our
and
the
appellants'
brief
and
by
the
brief
filed
in
this
case
by
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
on
behalf
of
the
heads
of
the
department
of
obstetrics
and
gynecology
in
66
of
the
79
leading
nonreligious
medical
schools
in
the
united
states.
this
court,
in
a
long
line
of
cases,
has
upheld
laws,
which
like
this
one,
are
affected
with
the
medical
interest,
where
it
was
shown
that
such
laws
were
supported
by
a
consensus
of
medical
opinions.
in
almost
all
of
these
cases,
the
court
plainly
implied
that
if
the
consensus
were
the
other
way,
those
enactments
could
not
stand.
several
of
these
cases
are
cited
and
discussed
in
our
and
in
the
appellants'
briefs,
among
them
the
(inaudible)
lambert
against
yellowley
and
jacobson
cases.
i
should
like
also
to
call
the
attention
of
this
court
to
an
additional
case,
namely,
price
against
illinois,
decided
by
this
court
in
1915,
where
mr.
justice
hughes
said
in
connection
with
the
claim
that
a
statute
prohibiting
the
use
of
boric
acid
as
a
food
preservative
was
unconstitutional
that
that
contention
"could
be
granted
only
if
it
appeared
that
by
a
consensus
of
opinions,
the
preservative
was
unquestionably
harmless".
in
our
cases,
the
devices
are
not
only
unquestionably
harmless,
but
they
are
also
conceded
to
be
the
best
and
safest
preventive
measures
necessary
for
the
protection
of
mrs.
doe
and
the
poes.
it
is
most
unusual
to
find
a
statute
like
this
where
a
lay
body
substitutes
its
view
for
the
view
of
a
substantially
unanimous
medical
profession.
in
the
january
9th,
1961
issue
of
the
new
england
medical
journal,
which
was
published
after
the
brief
in
this
case
was
filed,
now,
which
is
one
of
the
nation's
leading
medical
journals,
the
editorial
right
have
carried
the
connecticut
decision
here
under
review
to
its
logical,
and
it
seems
to
me,
necessary
conclusion
if
the
decision
stands.
pointing
out
that
the
state
of
connecticut
has,
and
i
quote,
"apparently,
not
yet
claim
the
right
to
decide
whether
to
prescribe
onion
poultices
or
antibiotics
for
the
treatment
of
pneumonia
or
to
prescribe
bedrest
or
surgery
for
gastric
ulcer,
but
apparently,
it
claims
to
have
that
right.
it
is
because
of
the
absurdity
of
a
lay
body
rejecting
in
the
absence
of
conclusive
information
of
any
kind
by
the
opinion
of
the
medical
profession."
now,
traditionally,
this
court
has
assumed
that
general
medical
prohibitions
of
this
sort
do
not
apply
to
proper
medical
practice.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
since
1879.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
actually,
some
of
the
authorities,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
show
that
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
medical
opinion
at
that
time
and
that
it
may
have
been
not
any
way
near
as
clear
as
it
is
now.
but
in
--
for
example,
mr.
glanville
williams'
book
on
the
criminal
law
and
the
sanctity
of
life,
he
points
out
that
the
medical
profession
at
that
time
would
have
been
in
favor
of
the
use
of
contraceptives,
but
whatever
doubt
might
have
existed,
has
certainly
been
resolved
by
the
medical
profession
since
and
today,
the
situation
is
substantially
unanimous.
as
far
back
as
just
11
years
or
in
the
21
years
later
than
1879,
in
1900,
this
court
in
austin
against
tennessee,
a
liquor
regulation
case
said
that
"if
the
legislative
body
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
a
due
regard
for
public
safety
and
morals
requires
a
suppression
of
the
liquor
traffic,
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
prevent
its
doing
so".
but
then
it
went
on
to
say,
"while
perhaps,
it
may
not
wholly
prohibit
the
use
or
sale
of
them
for
medicinal
purposes,
it
may
hedge
about
their
use
as
a
general
beverage,
such
restriction
as
it
pleases,"
and
he
added,
"nor
can
we
deny
to
the
legislature
the
power
to
impose
restrictions
on
the
sale
of
noxious
or
poisonous
drugs,
such
as
opium
and
other
similar
articles
extremely
valuable
as
medicines,
but
equally
harmful
to
the
habitual
user."
this
statute
does
not
recognize
any
such
distinction
which
has
uniformly
been
recognized
by
legislatures
and
courts
including
this
court
with
reference
to
almost
every
prohibition
of
liquor,
narcotics,
drugs
or
other
so-called
noxious
article.
we
haven't
unable
to
find
a
single
case
other
than
these
--
these
cases
and
the
massachusetts
cases
where
a
general
legislative
prohibition
has
been
applied
to
the
severe
detriment
of
individual
patients
in
a
manner
directly
contradictory
to
the
overwhelming
consensus
of
medical
opinion.
it
should
be
noted
that
underlying
the
decision
of
lower
courts,
accepting
medical
practice
from
general
prohibition,
is
obviously
the
belief
that
if
they
applied
against
the
consensus
of
medical
opinion,
they
might
well
be
unconstitutional,
so
that
a
number
of
these
cases,
although
they
involved
questions
of
statutory
construction,
were
obviously
resolved
in
terms
of
avoiding
serious
constitutional
issue.
this
court
has
made
very
clear
that,
for
example,
in
the
sweezy
case,
the
teachers
and
students
must
always
remain
free
to
inquire,
to
study,
to
evaluate,
to
gain
new
material
in
understanding,
otherwise
our
civilization
will
stagnate
and
die.
as
it's
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
mr.
whitney
north
seymour
for
the
heads
of
the
medical
schools,
he
points
out
that
it
would
be
ironic
indeed
if
the
freedom
to
conquer
new
frontiers
in
medicine
were
jealously
guarded,
but
the
duty
of
physicians
to
give
the
public
the
benefit
for
such
conquest
would've
be
subject
to
legislative
whims,
which
is
what
these
statutes
come
down
to
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
the
doctors,
although
they
are
free
to
learn
and
to
teach,
are
not
free
to
practice
what
they
teach.
now,
as
we
have
said
before,
the
connecticut
law
on
the
use
of
contraceptives
is
unique.
no
other
law
has
an
impact
on
use.
no
other
law
prohibits
use.
they
are
unique,
secondly,
because
most
statutes
in
the
field
of
contraception
are
not
prohibitory.
they
are
regulatory
as
the
breakdown
and
analysis
of
the
state
statutes
in
our
brief
demonstrates.
even
in
the
case
of
prohibitions
which
are
absolute
in
their
words,
on
their
face
as
for
example
is
the
case
of
the
federal
statutes
on
this
subject
and
some
of
the
state
statutes,
the
courts
have
interpreted
these
prohibitions
not
to
apply
the
cases
of
medical
necessity
such
as
we
have
here
presented.
for
example,
judge
augustus
hand
in
the
federal
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
united
states
against
one
package
said
that
notwithstanding
the
wording
of
the
federal
statute,
he
could
not
believe
and
the
court
held
with
him
that
things
"which
might
intelligently
be
employed
by
conscientious
and
competent
positions
for
the
purpose
of
saving
life
or
promoting
the
well-being
of
their
patients
could
be
prohibited
especially
since."
and
i
quote
again,
"in
many
cases,
this
is
advocated
by
such
a
weight
of
authority
in
the
medical
world."
now,
speaking
of
contraceptive
services
that
same
court
through
judge
learned
hand
had
earlier
said
in
considering
whether
or
not,
a
contraceptive
clinic
was
a
health
service,
that
he
could
see
no
difference
that
this
is
confined
to
married
women
who
were
not
to
have
children
both
for
their
own
and
their
children's
sake.
he
pointed
out
that
health
is
as
much
at
stake
as
all
--
as
though
it
attempted
the
general
prevention
of
sickness.
and
he
added,
"nor
does
it
matter
that
there
are
those
who
thinks
the
cure,
worse
than
the
disease.
there
are
people
who
object
to

prophylaxis,

the
varying
state
statutes
on
contraception
with
the
exception
of
the
connecticut
and
massachusetts
statute
has
similarly
been
construed
whether
prohibitory
on
their
face
or
not.

practice

part
of
their

of

and
maternal
public
health.
the
supreme
court
of
michigan,
which
is
fairly
typical,
has
referred
to
contraceptive
as
wholly
legitimate
and
"even
essential
to
public
health
and
welfare".
the
federal
administrative
authorities
have
followed
the
lead
of
the
federal
court.
the
pure
food
and
drug
administration
passes
upon
contraceptive
products.
for
example
that
requires
prescriptions
for
vaginal
diaphragm.
this
year,
in
fact
last
month,
the
food
and
drug
administration
cleared
for
sale
a
contraceptive
pill.
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
the
new
york
times
of
january
19th,
1961
reported
a
study
to
determine
whether
the
pill
also
had
the
effect
of
preventing
cancer.
the
article
stated
that
cervical
and
breast
cancer
appeared
to
be
unusually
infrequent
among
women
taking
the
pill
to
prevent
pregnancy.
clearly,
whether
if
the
study
establishes
that
the
pill
is
deterrent
to
cancer,
women
in
connecticut
will
be
permitted
to
use
it
nor
is
the
federal
activity,
with
reference
to
this
field,
limited
to
the
food
and
drug
administration.

only
in
connecticut,
and
perhaps
in
massachusetts,
would
impediments
be
placed
in
the
way
of
dr.
buxton
prescribing
and
mrs.
doe
and
mrs.
poe
from
using
contraceptives.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
raised
in
our
brief,
as
has
mr.
seymour,
the
question
whether,
if
a
doctor
did
not
prescribe
a
contraceptive
elsewhere
in
other
states,
it
didn't
have
such
a
law,
he
might
not
be
susceptible
to
claims
of
malpractice
if
he
did
not,
at
least,
indicate
that
contraceptives
were
available
if
he
had
reason,
religious
reasons
or
others
for
not
prescribing
them.
he
probably
would
at
least
have
had
be
to
aware
--
make
the
patient
aware
of
their
existence.
thus,
the
cases
are
pretty
clear
that
where
something
is
approved
by
a
substantial
consensus
of
medical
opinion
and
a
doctor
does
not
prescribe
that
something,
he
maybe
liable
from
malpractice,
that
--
those
cases
are
discussed
in
our
brief.
i
said
before
that
the
only
law
in
connecticut
dealing
with
the
subject
of
procreation
which
makes
no
exception
for
medical
practice
is
this
one
that
we're
now
considering.
as
professor
harper
pointed
out,
the
connecticut
law
forbids
abortion,
unless
it
is
necessary
to
preserve,
and
this
is
the
word
of
statute,
"the
life
of
the
mother
or
that
of
her
unborn
child".
the
connecticut
law
prohibits
voluntarily
sterilization,
unless
the
same
is
a
medical
necessity.
the
connecticut
law
prohibits
the
distribution
of
medicines,
instruments
or
other
devices
for
abortion
and
sterilization
except
to
a
licensed
physician
or
to
a
hospital
approved
by
the
state
department
of
health.
connecticut
law,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
provides
for
the
compulsory
sterilization
of
inmates
of
mental
institutions
if,
in
the
judgment
of
designated
doctors,
such
person
would
produce
children
with
an
inherited
tendency
to
crime,
mental
illness
or
mental
deficiency.

pilpel
that
it
maybe
performed
where
it
is
a
medical
necessity.
ms.

pilpel
well,
presumably,
he
could
have,
but
i
think
it
would
have
been
not
bad
medicine,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
because,
as
pointed
out
by
the
appellant
in
their
brief
and
as
is
well
known,
many
of
the
conditions
such
as
those
which
equip
the
appellants
in
these
cases
maybe
remedied,
if
time
is
given
to
remedy
them.
medical
science
is
advancing
all
the
time.
women
do
become
well
when
they
become
ill.
sterilization
is
an
irreversible
operation.
we
feel
that
for
this
statute
to
appear,
as
it
does
and
was
at
connecticut,
is
to
present
an
--
an
anomaly
similar
to
that
for
detention
to
bar
judge
hand
in
the
one
package
case,
where
he
pointed
out,
and
i
would
like
to
quote
this
because
it
applies,
it
seems
to
me,
right
here,
"that
while
it
is
true
that
the
policy
of
congress
has
been
to
forbid
the
use
of
contraceptives
all
together,
if
the
sole
purpose
of
using
them
be
to
prevent
conception
in
cases
where
it
would
be
injurious
to
the
welfare
of
the
patient
or
her
offspring,
it
is
going
far
beyond
such
a
policy
to
hold
that
abortions
which
destroy
and
simply
at
life,
maybe
allowed
in
proper
cases
and
yet
that
no
measures
can
be
taken
to
prevent
conception
even
though
a
likely
result
would
be
to
require
the
termination
of
the
pregnancy
by
means
of
an
operation.
it
seems
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
the
national
scheme
in
this
instance,
the
connecticut
scheme
of
legislation,
involve
such
inconsistencies
and
requires
the
complete
suppression
of
articles,
the
use
of
which
in
many
cases
is
advocated
by
such
a
weight
of
authority
in
the
medical
world."
it
is,
we
submit,
equally
unreasonable
to
construe
the
connecticut
statute
in
this
manner,
in
this
case.
and
since
they
have
themselves
construed,
we
maintain
that
they
are
unreasonable
and
unconstitutional.
our
reference
was
made
before
to
the
stand
of
various
religious
groups
on
the
subject
of
contraception.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
as
did
professor
harper,
that
not
only
his
medical
opinion
virtually
unanimous
in
calling
for
the
prescriptions
made
illegal
in
this
--
these
cases.
not
only
is
the
connecticut
statute
unique,
but
virtually
all
religious
groups
in
this
country
endure
some
method
of
contraception,
some
method
of
contraception
in
cases
like
this.
while
the
protestants
and
most
of
the
jewish
denominations
sanction
all
medically
approved
method
of
contraception,
there
are
two
religious
groups
who
differed
from
the
rest
in
this
regard
as
to
permissible
methods
and
dissent
on
certain
methods.
these
are
the
orthodox
jews
and
the
roman
catholics.
the
orthodox
jewish
rabbis,
speaking
in
a
resolution
of
their
rabbinical
alliance,
point
out
that
orthodox
judaism
does
not
condone
any
artificial
birth
control
measured
by
the
male
spouse
in
any
circumstances.
only
in
cases
where
the
health
of
the
female
is
jeopardized,
certain
birth
control
measure
is
allowed
and
then
only
through
a
direct
consultation
between
the
medical
and
rabbinical
authorities.
thus,
both
the
roman
catholics
and
the
orthodox
jews
approves
the
use
of
certain
contraceptive
methods
as
a
matter
of
religious
faith
and
of
course,
those
groups
have
a
right
to
refrain
from
using
these
methods.
that
--
it
is
a
matter
of
religious
faith
appears
fairly
clear.
for
example,
the
code
of
catholic
hospitals
says
their
operations,
treatments
and
devices
designed
to
render
conception
impossible
are
morally
objectionable.
whereas,
therefore,
these
religious
groups
have
the
right
to
refrain
from
endorsing
of
--
in
fact
can
go
so
far
as
to
prohibit
the
members
of
those
groups
from
using
certain
methods
of
contraception.
we
submit
that
neither
they
nor
anyone
else
has
the
right
to
impose
such
matters
of
religious
faith
on
other
people.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
goes
not
to
religious
faith
to
--
but
to
whether
there
is
a
secular
interest
or
state
interest
that
justifies
the
impact
of
these
statutes
on
appellants.
now,
the
state
has
--
ms.
harriet
pilpel
no,
i
would
have
no
information
about
that,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
i
don't
think
it's
relevant
to
the
problem,
your
honor
ms.
harriet
pilpel
well,
for
several
reasons.
one
reasoning
is
that
this
problem
has
to
do
with
what
i
call
a
secular
interest.
and
that
i
do
not
believe
that
a
matter
--
ms.
harriet
pilpel
well,
they
have
cast
secular
votes
and
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
know
whether
secular
reasons
motivated
their
casting
of
their
vote.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
that
is
correct.
but
we
--
we
have,
i
think,
shown
that
there
are
no
secular
interest
that
justify
the
keeping
of
a
statute
on
the
book.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
well,
it
isn't
my
judgment,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
it's
the
judgment
of
the
substantially
unanimous
medical
profession,
which
happens
to
be
the
group
that
is
expert
in
this
field.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
if
the
legislators
were
free
to
disregard
without
reason,
any
expert
opinion
in
any
field
to
which
they
were
operating,
then
presumably,
there
would
be
no
function
for
the
due
process
clause.
but
it
is
our
contention
in
this
case
that
all
of
the
rational
considerations,
all
of
those
cognizable
in
terms
of
public
interest
and
welfare
are
in
the
direction
of
declaring
these
laws
invalid
in
these
cases.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
no,
your
honor.
we
recognize
that
we
have
the
heavy
burden
in
this
case
and
always
the
proponent
of
a
statute
being
unconstitutional
has
the
burden.
but
we
believe
when
the
body
of
experts
which
has
special
knowledge
in
this
field,
which
all
the
states
in
the
federal
government
has
set
aside
as
the
people
best
able
to
judge
the
rights
and
wrongs
in
terms
of
physical
science
in
these
matters,
have
taken
the
position
they
have,
when
the
entire
--
when
the
state
and
federal
government
courts,
etcetera,
have
all
followed
suit
that
we
have
at
least
regarded
any
assumption
that
the
statute
is
constitutional
because
the
legislature
passed
it.
and
then
it
then
becomes
the
duty
of
the
state
in
the
words
of
the
bates
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
used
and
i'm
read
with
your
honor
has
often
used,
it
becomes
the
duty
of
the
state
to
establish
that
there
is
some
rational
basis
for
the
statute.
we
--
ms.
harriet
pilpel
we
do
not
believe
that
the
only
question
imposed
here
is
a
matter
of
physiology,
but
we
do
believe
that
where
drastic,
physical
impediments
to
the
point
possibly
of
death
and
certainly
serious
disease
are
opposed
upon
people
against
the
direct
and
almost
unanimous
consensus
of
medical
opinion
that
the
state
must
show
that
there
is
some
basis
on
which
this
extremely
drastic
result
can
be
justified.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
i
am
arguing,
your
honor,
with
reference
to
these
cases
and
i
would
simply
like
to
say
that
i
think
life
and
death
is
a
narrow
way
of
putting
it,
i
would
prefer,
if
your
honor
will
permit,
to
save
life
and
health.
in
other
words,
it
would
apply
to
cases
where
life
and
health
are
involved
and
we
submit
that
where
life
and
health
are
involved,
that
they
are
in
the
case
of
these
appellants
in
these
circumstances,
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
my
argument
is
restricted
to
these
cases
and
that's
the
only
argument
i
contend
with.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
no,
your
honor,
most
definitely
not.
i
--
i
am
making
the
proposition
only
that
where
there
are
serious
deprivations
of
life
and
health
imposed
upon
people
in
the
medical
field,
where
that
imposition
is
directly
contrary
to
the
overwhelming
unanimity
of
medical
opinions,
where
all
other
factors
in
the
,community
such
as
the
religious
and
others,
are
also
against
that
terrific
deprivation
on
these
patients,
that
there
must
be
demonstrated
something
more
than
some
general
language
about
the
police
power,
to
permit
the
statute's
application
in
those
cases.
ms.
harriet
pilpel
if
the
state
legislature
differs
with
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
medical
opinion
and
imposes
serious
deprivations
of
life
and
health
on
the
appellant,
then
i
think
there
is
a
serious
question
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
to
whether,
unless
like
mr.
justice
stewart
called
a
subordinating
interest,
something
as
important
that
could
be
balanced
against
what
we
have
just
said,
unless
that
is
demonstrated,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
to
those
appellants.
