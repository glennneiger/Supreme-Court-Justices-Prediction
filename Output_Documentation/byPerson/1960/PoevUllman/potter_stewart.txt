mr.
harper
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
don't
need
to
answer
this
now,
but
is
your
--
is
your
argument
directed
to
this
statute
as
--
of
course
it
is,
as
applied
to
these
--
to
these
petitioners,
to
these
appellants.
but
with
respect
to
these
appellants,
the
state
has
conceded
that
it
would
involve
the
health
and
perhaps
the
life
of
the
first
appellant,
involved
basically
the
mental
health
of
the
second.
this
would
lead
us,
however,
not
necessarily
to
strike
down
the
--
the
statute
as
applied
to
other
people
whose
health
was
not
involved,
who
could
not
make
a
showing
that
the
use
of
contraceptive
was
necessary
to
preserve
their
health
or
life?
justice
potter
stewart
and
presumably,
he'd
be
called
upon
to
be
an
accessory
as
the
connecticut
calls
him
only
with
respect
to
somebody
whose
--
whose
health
is
involved.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
your
argument
would
not
lead
us
to
--
would
it,
necessarily
to
--
even
if
we
accepted
it
all,
it
wouldn't
lead
us
to
--
to
strike
down
the
statute
on
its
face
as
applied
to
everybody
in
connecticut.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
harper
--
justice
potter
stewart
these
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
came
to
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
and
come
here
on
demurrers
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
the
complaint.
therefore,
i
suppose
notice
what
you
call
evidence.
none
of
these
--
none
of
the
--
none
of
these
data
were
before
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
wondering
whether
--
whether
this
was
presented
to
this
--
to
the
connecticut
court
in
at
least
the
four
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
my
brother
frankfurter
asked
you
a
few
minutes
ago,
mr.
harper,
whether
you're
going
to
make
any
free
speech
claim
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
i've
heard
your
answer.
how
about
of
freedom
to
practice
religion
claim,
is
that
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
--
are
there
any
religions
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
at
--
well,
of
course,
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record,
but
is
there
--
is
that
a
possible
issue
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
probably
not
what
happened
here.
is
this
--
this
statute
is,
what?
80
years
old.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
in
enacting
the
statute,
it
--
probably
it
isn't
factually
correct
to
say
that
the
legislature
disregarded
the
unanimous
medical
opinion
because
apparently,
there
wasn't
any
such
thing,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
like
--
it's
like
permitting
a
doctor
to
tell
a
patient
that
he
has
appendicitis,
if
he
doesn't
have
it
removed,
he's
going
to
die,
but
--
but
they're
not
allowing
the
--
any
--
any
surgeon
to
remove
the
appendix,
isn't
it?
