justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
have
said
nothing
about
the
infraction
of
free
speech.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
agree
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
mean
by
putting
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
by
--
by
requiring
to
keep
his
mouth
shut,
you
don't
say
--
you
make
no
claim
that
he
is
deprived
of
his
area
of
freedom
of
utterance.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
why
is
that?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
don't
have
to
spell
out
your
argument
in
order
to
make
a
claim
that
something
is
invalid.
i
don't
follow
it,
i
must
say.
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
i
--
you
are
here
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
liberty
in
that,
insofar
as
the
protection
of
freedom
of
speech,
protects
freedom
of
speech.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
for
me
to
decide
how
you
should
argue.
[laughter]
it's
nor
for
me
to
decide
or
suggest
what
you
should
or
shouldn't
argue.
it
is
for
me
to
try
to
understand
the
arguments
that
are
made.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
the
law
regarding
sterilization
outside
of
state
institutions?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
that
dr.
buxton
could've
served
that
(inaudible)
could
he
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
before
you
--
before
you
move
on,
ms.
pilpel,
are
you
suggesting
that
these
two
groups
are
the
minority
in
connecticut
and
have
imposed
their
minority
use
on
the
state
or
are
you
suggesting
that
they
represent
the
majority
of
use
in
the
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
think
it's
not
a
relevant
question
to
the
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
not?
justice
felix
frankfurter
wouldn't
it
not
be
the
legislators
who
have
refused
to
change
the
law,
had
cast
secular
votes
in
its
favor
or
at
least
have
upstate
in
using
the
secular
vote
against
them?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
order
that's
--
it's
a
secular
machinery
that
has
kept
this
statute
on
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
--
you're
stating
your
judgment
against
fair
judgment,
aren't
you?
justice
felix
frankfurter
to
which
the
legislators
of
connecticut
have
not
responded.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
your
--
and
your
legal
proposition
is
that
whenever
you
can
present
to
this
court
the
opinion
of
the
overwhelming
view
--
overwhelming
opinion
of
the
medical
profession
as
opposed
to
some
existing
law
of
a
state,
that,
in
and
of
itself,
suffices
to
invalidate
the
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
suppose
that
the
only
question
involved
here
is
the
question
of
physiology.
justice
felix
frankfurter
even
if
i
accept
the
very
least
you've
said
the
last
two
minutes,
the
minute
and
a
half,
it
would
only
apply
to
cases
where
the
remedy
involved
life
and
death,
where
the
unavailability
of
the
remedy
involves
life
and
death.
would
you
--
would
you
invalidate
the
statute
on
its
face?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
restricted
to
these
cases
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
even
on
your
purpose.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
that
argument.
what
is
the
bearing
of
these
incidents
of
maternity
deaths
to
fatalities
or
miserable
lives
not
leading
in
--
not
leading
to
births,
i
don't
--
that's
--
i
misunderstand
your
argument.
justice
felix
frankfurter
how
do
those
--
how
do
those
figures
bear
on
the
claim
that
potential
pregnancies
are
a
great
danger
to
health
of
an
undefined,
but
presumably,
a
considerable
percentage
of
women
in
connecticut?
justice
felix
frankfurter
so
the
few
women,
relatively
few
women
are
happy
--
the
small
number
of
women
die
in
--
in
childbirth
in
connecticut.
isn't
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
all
these
figures
show.
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
course,
your
figures
might
consistent
with
a
general
disregard
of
the
prohibitory
laws
of
connecticut.
if
nobody
pays
any
attention
to
these
laws
or
if
relatively
few
people
pay
attention,
then
the
same
result
would
be
achieved,
namely,
no
danger
ensue,
isn't
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
should
violate
the
law.
i'm
suggesting
that,
in
fact,
an
absence
of
figures
showing
death
from
the
--
of
the
mrs.
poe
and
the
mrs.
doe
may
indicate
that
other
people
may
not
be
as
scrupulous
as
apparently
the
poes
and
the
does
were.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
do
you
--
do
you
challenge
the
claim
that
--
that
a
practical
--
practically
speaking,
the
medical
profession
is
unanimous
in
thinking
that
this
statute
as
the
--
the
true
enactments
of
connecticut
are
a
standing
menace
to
women
in
connecticut?
and
secondly,
do
you
challenge
the
statement
that
there
is
no
feasible,
no
alternative
that
isn't
worse
than
a
disease
but
at
least
as
equally
bad
in
its
result?
justice
felix
frankfurter
challenge
both
of
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
--
if
both
of
them
are
challengeable,
then
you
raise
the
--
then
you
deal
specifically
instead
of
at
large
with
the
question
whether
this
is
a
contested
problem
in
moral,
in
physiology
as
to
which
ignorant
layman's
judgment
in
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
make
an
ignorant
choice.
that's
what
people
elect
legislatures
for,
not
to
be
ignorant,
but
in
a
democracy,
they
have
a
right
to
elect
even
ignorant
people
or
inadequately
--
scientifically
inadequately
informed
people
to
be
--
to
sit
in
the
seats
of
legislation,
for
legislation.
is
that
what
you're
challenging?
i
haven't
heard
any
of
the
statistics
except
the
one
you've
just
given
me
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
the
maternity
death
rate
in
connecticut
is
--
is
happily
low.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
all
depends
whether
--
whether
the
views
--
the
religious
views
that
have
been
put
before
us
are
the
views
of
the
majority
in
the
state
and
if
they
are
the
views
of
the
majority
in
the
state,
presumably,
the
legislators
reflect
those
views
or
that
there's
an
authority
and
the
power
outside
of
the
electoral
power
that
coerces
or
influences
the
legislators
to
take
a
minority
view
because
they
don't
want
to
offend
that
outside
authoritative
power.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright,
then
--
then
the
alternative
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
must
be
that
these
reflect
a
majority
view
of
the
people
year
after
year,
turn
back
legislators
who
don't
want
to
change
this
law.
that's
your
contention.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
cannon,
would
you
please
tell
me
why
you
think
that
this
is
not
a
fair
statement
of
the
case
before
us
that
the
state
of
connecticut
forbids
dr.
buxton
from
speaking
professionally
to
a
patient
who
consults
him
in
regard
to
a
situation
which
he
deems
critically
serious
for
life
to
that
patient.
and
it
prevents
him
from
stating
that
to
her
because
in
the
generality
of
cases,
their
life
would
not
be
at
stake,
he's
forbidden
to
tell
what
the
state
says
he
mustn't
speak.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
the
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
why
i
put
it
to
you.suppose
you
modified
or
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
let's
begin.
he
is
forbidden
to
say
something
which
he
professionally
wants
to
communicate,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
then
the
question
comes
up
whether
this
statute
bars
him
for
making
professional
utterance.
that's
correct,
too.
justice
felix
frankfurter
would
you
now
say
it
is
--
the
state
may
so
bar
such
utterance.
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
i
--
going
to
give
you
--
give
us
the
reason
why
it
may
so
barred
in
this
particular
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
the
--
all
offense
were
freedom
of
speech
is
in
the
hierarchy
of
constitutional
values,
doesn't
it?
