mr.
fowler
v.
harper
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
appeals
derived
from
three
cases,
initiated
simultaneously
in
the
lower
courts
of
the
state
of
connecticut,
went
to
the
supreme
court
of
errors
and
are
here
now
on
appeal
under
u.s.c.
1257.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
were
consolidated
here
for
oral
argument
because
they
raised
the
same
federal
question,
although
the
three
cases
raised
them
--
raised
it
in
somewhat
slightly
different
factual
contents.
now,
these
are
the
cases,
three
cases,
your
honor,
doe
versus
ullmant
--
ullman,
poe
versus
ullman
and
buxton
versus
ullman.
now,
these
are
the
cases.
appellant
doe
is
a
woman
now
27
years
of
age,
who
lives
in
new
haven
with
her
husband,
28.
they
have
no
living
children.
four
years
ago,
mrs.
poe
became
ill
with
a
cardiovascular
ailment.
she
also
became
pregnant
and
developed
toxemia
pregnancy.
in
these
circumstances,
her
physician,
who
was
appellant
buxton,
decided
that
the
best
way
to
save
her
life
was
to
terminate
the
pregnancy.
i
might
add
that
under
law
of
connecticut,
it
is
lawful
to
terminate
the
pregnancy
of
a
woman
in
order
to
save
her
life,
although
it
is
not
lawful
to
advice
and
have
her
use
a
contraceptive
to
prevent
her
becoming
pregnant.
she
was
admitted
to
the
greystone
haven
hospital
in
this
condition.
before
they
could
carry
out
this
procedure,
however,
appellant
doe
suffered
a
severe
cerebral
hemorrhage.
she
was
unconscious
for
two
weeks
in
a
critical
condition
for
nine
weeks,
during
which
time
it
was
necessary
to
carry
out
several
lifesaving
procedures.
now,
in
these
circumstances,
her
physician
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lesser
risk
for
her
life
would
be
to
let
the
pregnancy
go
full
term
rather
than
subject
her
to
the
operation
to
terminate
her
pregnancy.
it
did
go
full
term.
she
delivered
a
stillborn
fetus.
she
was
subsequently
discharged
from
the
hospital,
the
same
heart
ailment,
paralyzed
partially,
she
has
no
use
of
her
left
arm,
she
wears
a
sling,
she
wears
her
left
leg
in
a
pulley
clamp,
she
had
to
learn
to
talk
all
over
because
of
paralysis
of
her
face.
her
physician
has
told
her
that
another
pregnancy
will
probably
result
in
her
death.
she
then
asked
dr.
buxton
to
prescribe
for
her
the
best
treatment
for
her
--
a
woman
in
her
condition.
dr.
buxton
said,
"yes,
i
have
knowledge
of
the
best
medical
treatment.
it
will
be
to
prescribe
for
you
and
for
--
to
you
to
use
certain
drugs,
medicinal
articles
and
devices
to
prevent
another
pregnancy.
"however,
he
said,
"i
cannot
prescribe
them
because
the
appellee,"
state's
attorney
here,
"claims
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
a
connecticut
statute."
that
statute
provides
that
this
is
a
criminal
offense
for
any
person
to
use
an
article,
drug
or
device
to
prevent
conception.
the
appellee
further
claims,
appellee
ullman,
that
he
will
prosecute
any
violation
of
this
law,
as
indeed
he
has.
in
state
versus
nelson,
when
he
procured
a
conviction
of
a
physician
and
two
nurses,
his
assistants,
for
violating
the
accessory
law,
which
makes
a
person
a
criminal
in
the
same
degree
for
aiding
and
abetting
another
person
committing
a
crime.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
that's
the
basis.
yes,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
that
is
a
basis
because
prescribing
--
the
court
held
in
state
versus
nelson
that
for
a
physician
to
prescribe
for
a
woman,
the
use
of
a
contraceptive
device,
was
aiding
and
abetting
her
in
the
commission
of
a
crime.
and
under
a
connecticut
statute,
the
general
accessory
statute,
he
is
liable
as
the
principal.
there
was
on
that
basis
the
dr.
nelson
and
the
two
nurses
were
convicted.
now,
in
these
circumstances,
appellant
doe
claimed
that
she
had
a
constitutional
right
to
protect
her
life
by
the
best
medical
treatment.
and
that
these
laws
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
and
she
had
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that
asked
the
connecticut
court
so
to
declare.
appellee
ullman
demurred
to
the
complaint,
thus
submitting
all
the
facts
which
i've
just
related.
the
demurrer
was
sustained
by
the
lower
court,
affirmed
by
the
court
of
errors
and
the
case
is
here
on
appeal.
now,
in
the
case
of
poe,
it's
somewhat
similar
but
the
factual
situation
is
somewhat
different.
mrs.
poe
is
a
woman,
30
years
old,
her
husband
is
34.
he's
a
businessman.
they
lived
together
in
connecticut.
they
have
no
living
children.
mrs.
poe
has
been
pregnant
three
times,
each
time
delivering
a
child
with
mentally
--
mentally
defective
and
physically
defective,
with
both
mental
and
physical
abnormalities
inconsistent
with
life.
each
of
these
children
died
within
10
days.
now,
mrs.
poe
has
asked
appellee
--
appellant
dr.
buxton
to
prescribe
for
her,
and
he's
made
the
same
answer
to
her
that
he
made
to
mrs.
doe.
appellant
poe
then
rather
declaratory
judgment
action
just
as
mrs.
doe
did,
claiming
that
she
had
a
constitutional
right
to
use
the
best
medical
means
to
prevent
the
birth
of
further
mongoloid
children.
and
the
emotional
travail
which
it
had
already
caused
this
couple
three
times.
the
same
result,
demur
--
admitting
all
these
facts
sustained
--
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
errors
here
on
appeal.
dr.
buxton
brings
his
action
in
his
own
right.
he
does
not
claim
that
this
law
deprives
him
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
of
his
life
or
his
liberty
as
to
appellants
doe
and
poe.
dr.
buxton
claims
that
this
deprives
him
of
his
property
and
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
because
he
says,
"i
cannot
practice
medicine
according
to
my
oath,
according
to
my
conscience
and
according
to
the
highest
standards
of
medical
science."
now,
these
are
the
three
cases.
actually
--
technically,
i
suppose
they
raised
two
questions,
both
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
does
this
connecticut
law
forbidding
the
use
of
contraceptives,
take
the
life
and
liberty
of
doe's
and
poe's
without
due
process
of
law?
the
second
technical
question
is,
does
the
anti-contraceptive
law,
in
connection
with
the
accessory
law,
as
applied
to
dr.
buxton,
deprived
him
of
his
property
and
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law?
actually,
they
boil
down
to
the
same
question.
because
it
is
clear
that
if
a
law
forbidding
the
use
of
a
contraceptive
device
is
constitutional,
then
certainly
dr.
buxton
will
be
guilty
under
the
accessory
statute
for
prescribing
these
devices.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
anti-contraceptive
law
is
unconstitutional,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
dr.
buxton
will
not
be
guilty
of
any
crime
by
prescribing
the
use
of
these
contraceptives.
now,
your
honors,
the
argument
of
these
appellants
can
be
stated
rather
simply
as
to
its
pattern.
it
depends
upon
four
propositions.
one,
that
if
these
laws
constitute
a
serious
threat
to
life
and
personal
liberty,
the
state
must
justify.
secondly,
these
laws
do
constitute
a
serious
threat
to
life
and
personal
liberty.
third,
there
is
no
justifying,
countervailing
interest
of
the
state.
and
fourth,
notwithstanding
these
three
propositions,
if
necessary,
these
appellants
are
perfectly
willing
to
assume
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
the
serious
threat
to
life
and
the
outrageous
invasions
of
personal
liberty
so
up,
so
far
out
way
any
presumed
or
illusory
or
actual
advantages
of
this
law
in
the
interest
of
public
health
or
morality,
that
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
whatever
on
which
they
can
stand.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
not
at
all,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
that's
right,
sir.
unaddended
to
that
answer,
i
should
like
to
make
in
due
course.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
yes,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
our
position,
your
honor,
is
this.
that
the
laws
as
applied
to
appellants
doe
and
poe
are
unconstitutional
on
their
face
and/or
as
applied
to
them.
our
position
as
far
as
dr.
buxton
is
that
the
laws
are
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
him.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
precisely,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
our
arguments,
your
honor,
are
two
fold.
one,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
secondly
and
alternatively,
but
if
it
is
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
these
three
appellants.
now,
as
to
the
first
proposition,
that
these
laws
are
serious
threat
to
life
and
if
so
--
to
life
and
personal
liberty,
the
state
must
justify.
i
should
like
to
refer
and
to
be
accurate,
i
shall
quote
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
the
recent
case
of
bates
against
little
rock,
involving
an
arkansas
law,
which
required
full
listing
of
memberships
of
all
organizations.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
that's
our
first
proposition,
your
honor.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
that's
the
first
proposition.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
yes,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
yes,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
that's
our
first
proposition.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
the
alternative
one
is
--
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
--
that
it
has
no
business
insofar
as
the
context
of
these
cases
is
concerned.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
the
first
proposition
just
suggested
by
the
chief
justice
--
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
--
is
independent
of
the
condition
of
these
women.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
the
second
proposition
includes
in
application
limited
to
the
women
on
these
cases.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
we're
not
--
there's
no
--
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
--
there's
no
claim,
your
honor
--
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
--
that
the
statutes
violate
dr.
buxton's
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
no,
sir.
no
claim
was
made
under
the
first
amendment,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
well,
your
honor,
if
you
will
permit
me,
there
are
three
more
cases
pending
in
the
supreme
court
of
errors,
two
of
which
raised
first
amendment
issues.
now,
whether
it
was
wise
or
unwise,
dr.
buxton
not
to
claim
it,
he
had
a
right
to
talk
to
his
patients
by
way
of
giving
them
medical
advice.
that
claim
was
not
made
and
is
not
made
in
these
cases.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
were
permissible
for
me
to
argue
a
free
speech
issue
under
the
pleadings
in
this
case,
i
should
be
very
happy
to
do
so.
but
actually
in
the
connecticut
case
of
one
and
only
one
question
was
raised,
namely,
that
these
cases
violate
the
due
clause
--
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
they
deprived
appellants
poe
and
doe
of
their
lives
and
their
liberty
without
due
process
of
law
and
they
deprived
appellant
buxton
of
his
liberty
and
his
property
without
due
process
of
law.
if
i
should
be
permitted
in
addition
to
argue,
they
violate
freedom
of
speech
as
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment,
i
should
be
most
happy
to
do
so.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
yes,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
then
if
i
may
amend
my
statement,
your
honor,
i
say
we
will
claim
and
shall
claim
and
do
claim.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
well,
the
argument
perhaps
i'm
about
to
make,
may
in
part
be
an
answer,
although
i
assume
it
may
not
be
an
adequate
one.
the
argument
is
this,
but
i
--
the
decision
of
mr.
justice
stewart
in
his
opinion
in
the
little
rock
case,
he
took
this
position.
and
i'm
quoting
accurately,
"the
decision
in
this
case
has
finally
turned,
therefore,
on
whether
the
cities,
as
instrumentalities
of
the
state,
have
demonstrated
so
cogent
an
interest
in
obtaining
and
making
public
the
membership
list
of
these
organizations,
as
to
justify
substantial
abridgment
of
association
of
freedom,
which
such
disclosures
will
affect.
where
there
is
a
significant
encroachment
upon
personal
liberty,
the
state
may
prevail
only
upon
showing
a
subordinating
interest
which
is
compelling."
citing
a
number
of
cases.
i
might
add
to
mr.
justice
clark
in
the
recent
don
juan
case,
his
language
implying
precisely
the
same
when
he
said,
"it's
not
for
this
court
to
limit
the
state
in
its
selection
of
a
remedy
to
be
most
effective
to
cope
with
such
problem,
absent,
of
course,
a
showing
upon
reasonable
scriptures
on
individual
liberty
resulting
from
its
application
in
particular
circumstances.
we
expect
to
show
serious
threat
to
life
as
well
as
in
invasion
of
civil
liberties."
now,
your
honor,
i
realize
that
these
statements
and
most
of
the
cases
supporting
them
are
cases
involving
first
amendment
liberties.
mostly
--
for
the
most
--
for
the
most
part,
freedom
of
speech.
but
it
is
submitted
that
the
right
to
live
is
as
important,
at
least,
as
a
right
to
speak
freely.
after
all,
the
right
to
speak
freely
is
of
little
use
to
a
person
whose
powers
of
utterance
had
been
silenced
by
death.
moreover,
there
are
other
cases,
and
i
should
like
to
point
--
point
out
that
many
of
the
cases
involving
property,
business,
freedom
in
the
marketplace,
in
which
this
court
has
imposed
a
burden
upon
the
person's
challenging
the
law,
are
not
at
all
to
be
acquainted
with
the
situation
here
involving
an
invasion
of
civil
liberty,
personal
liberty
and
life
itself,
the
threat
to
life
itself.
now,
appellee,
in
its
brief,
refers
to
dr.
buxton
in
pointing
out
that
his
property
really
is
negligible
here,
that
the
fees
which
he
will
derive
from
abetting
a
woman
for
vaginal
diaphragm
must
be
a
negligible
part
of
his
income.
and
indeed,
it
is.
actually,
it's
no
part
of
his
income
at
all.
dr.
buxton
does
not
receive
the
fees.
they
go
to
the
clinic
in
the
hospital.
he's
a
professor
upbringing
on
a
salary.
so,
dr.
buxton
is
not
interested
in
fees.
what
dr.
buxton
is
interested
in
is
not
property.
dr.
buxton
is
not
selling
insurance.
he's
not
running
a
brokerage
firm,
not
operating
a
series
of
billboards
for
advertising
purposes.
dr.
buxton
is
interested
in
saving
the
life
and
preserving
the
health
of
his
patients
and
fees
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
what
he
wants
to
do
is
to
practice
medicine
according
to
his
conscience
and
according
to
the
highest
standards
of
medical
science.
now,
the
cases,
therefore,
involving
property
it
seems
to
me
are
not
applicable.
certainly,
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
more
important
interest
to
justify
the
invasion
of
personal
liberties
as
such
in
this
case
and
that
serious
threat
to
life
that
it
does
in
those
cases,
which
involve
only
money.
now,
secondly,
do
these
laws
constitute
a
serious
threat
to
life
or
health
and
personal
liberty?
appellant
doe
will
die
of
another
pregnancy.
it
is
conceded
that
the
best
methods
to
prevent
another
pregnancy
are
forbidden
by
these
laws.
mrs.
poe
will
have
another
mongoloid
child.
this
is
interesting.
this
court
has
held
in
buck
versus
bell
that
under
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
a
state
may,
by
compulsion,
against
the
will
of
a
feeble-minded
woman,
sterilize
her
in
order
to
prevent
her
from
having
feeble-minded
children.
the
state
of
connecticut
has
a
law
which
prevents
a
woman
from
using
approved
medical
treatment
to
prevent
her
from
having
another
mongoloid
child.
certainly,
the
constitution
cannot
be
that
erratic.
therefore,
there
are
serious
sentence
here.
what
state
of
connecticut
says
to
these
women
is
this,
"yes,
you
may
try
to
save
your
life
and
your
emotional
and
physical
health,
but
only
by
the
methods
least
likely
to
succeed."
what
are
those
methods?
well,
in
the
tileston
case,
the
court
suggested
that
the
safe
period
or
rhythm
period
would
not
come
within
the
band
of
these
statutes.
now,
the
rhythm
system
as
dr.
rock,
who
studied
these
problems,
has
described
it
is
one
way
people
have
children
and
the
data
appears
to
--
to
vary
amount.
in
a
poll
taken
by
dr.
guttmacher
over
3000
doctors,
this
is
in
the
brief
at
page
15,
only
1.4%
of
the
doctors
regarded
the
rhythm
system
as
a
reliable
way
to
prevent
conception,
1.4%.
now,
as
to
abstinence,
the
court
in
tileston
said
that
abstinence
was
a
reasonable
alternative
and
therefore,
the
law
was
not
unreasonable.
the
court
said,
"do
the
frailties
of
human
nature,
the
uncertainties
of
human
passions
render
abstinence
an
unreasonable
way
to
avoid
conception?"
the
court
concluded
that
it
did.
but
as
you
will
notice
in
the
same
table
that
i
just
quoted,
that
98.5%
of
the
physicians
polled
disagreed
with
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
on
the
medical
treatment
for
women
who
will
die
with
another
pregnancy.
in
other
words,
only
1.5%,
i
should
say
negligibly
fractional
agreed
with
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut.
now,
your
honors,
i
should
like
to
clear
a
way
a
little
beyond
the
brush
in
this
--
in
these
cases.
the
court
below,
in
its
opinion
disposing
of
all
three
of
these
cases,
spent
a
good
bit
of
time
considering
questions
which
have
been
raised
in
other
cases,
but
not
in
this
one.
in
--
in
the
first
case,
nelson
against
the
state,
which
came
to
this
court
or
which
was
--
has
gone
to
the
supreme
court
of
errors,
the
second
case,
tileston
versus
ullman,
which
did
reach
this
court
but
was
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
doctor
had
no
standing
to
sue.
he
was
asserting
the
constitutional
rights
of
his
patients
and
not
of
his
own.
in
both
of
those
cases,
it
was
urged
by
petitioners
that
the
court
should
lead
an
exception
into
the
law
as
indeed
it
had
read
--
as
indeed
there
was
an
exception
expressly
in
the
abortion
law.
abortion
was
illegal
except
for
the
purpose
of
saving
a
life
of
a
woman,
of
the
mother.
now,
it
was
argued,
but
certainly
the
legislature,
in
the
much
less
serious
matter
of
contraception,
must
have
intended
a
similar
exception
there.
that
question
was
raised
in
both
the
nelson
and
the
tileston
case.
actually,
the
supreme
court
of
errors
turned
the
argument
back
upon
the
petitioners
and
said,
"the
legislature
expressed
and
stated
the
exception
in
the
abortion
statute,
if
it
intended
one
here,
it
would've
put
it
in."
now,
that
question
was
disposed
of
in
two
cases
by
the
supreme
court
of
errors
interpreting
a
connecticut
statute.
these
appellants
did
not
raise
that
question.
they
accepted
that
interpretation
of
the
court
of
connecticut
and
the
question
of
an
exception
being
read
in
by
the
court
was
never
raised.
yet,
the
court
below
in
its
opinion
spends
substantial
amount
of
the
opinion
discussing
that.
also
in
that
opinion,
there
are
considerable
discussions
and
--
concerning
the
three
departments
of
government
and
how
one
department
cannot
encroach
on
another
and
so
forth.
the
court
below,
in
its
opinion
in
the
supreme
court
of
errors,
disposed
of
this
case
in
one
paragraph
only.
the
substance
of
which
was,
we
admit,
that
the
forbidden
contraceptives
of
the
best
medical
treatment
that
abstinence
is
a
reasonable
alternative.
and
that,
your
honors,
is
a
position
taken
by
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut.
now,
as
to
abstinence
itself,
there's
a
great
deal
of
evidence,
medical
evidence
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
amicus
curiae,
to
indicate
that
abstinence
is
unhealthy
as
well
as
impractical.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
stated
to
which
i
just
referred,
only
1.5%
of
the
doctors
said
that
they
would
prescribe
abstinence
as
a
method
of
preventing
conception
for
woman
whose
life
would
be
in
danger
by
another
pregnancy.
in
other
words,
1.5%
of
the
medical
profession
according
to
this
poll,
over
3000
doctors,
agrees
with
the
supreme
court
of
errors
that
abstinence
is
a
perfectly
practical
and
a
reasonable
alternative.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
yes.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
yes,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
that's
right,
sir.
all
of
the
data
which
i
have
cited
is
data
which
this
court
knows
because
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
jacobson,
what
everybody
knows,
this
court
knows
that
all
scientific
data
are
authenticated
and
documented.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
all
of
these
materials
--
most
of
these
materials
were
presented
to
the
connecticut
court.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
as
--
so
far
as
the
physical
facts
are
concerned,
of
course,
we
didn't
prove
those
because
a
demurrer
was
filed
in
medical
facts.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
now,
your
honors,
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
invasion
of
civil
liberties,
that
is
to
say
the
liberty
of
the
marital
relation.
only
last
year,
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
decided
that
a
man
was
entitled
to
a
degree
of
separation
from
his
wife
on
the
grounds
of
abandonment
because
she
declined
to
have
sexual
intercourse
with
him
and
the
declamation
was
on
religious
grounds.
it
so
happened
that
this
couple
had
been
married
by
civil
wedding.
the
lady
subsequently
having
been
advised
by
her
spiritual
adviser
that
she
was
--
had
not
been
married
according
to
the
church,
declined
to
have
marital
relationship
with
her
husband
until
they
had
been
married
according
to
the
church.
he
declined
--
the
court
of
appeals
granted
him
a
separation
on
the
ground
that
his
wife
had
abandoned
him.
judge
ford
said
sexual
relations
between
men
and
women
are
given
a
socially
and
legalized
sanction,
only
when
they
take
place
in
marriage.
and
in
turn,
marriage
is
a
self-distinguished
from
all
other
social
relationships
by
the
role
of
sexual
intercourse
between
the
parties
placed
in
it.
this
being
so,
it
may
not
be
doubted,
that
a
total
and
irrevocable
negation
of
what
is
lawful
in
marriage
and
unlawful
in
every
other
relationship
or
what
unmistakably
and
uniquely
characterizes
marriage
in
no
other
relationship,
constitutes
abandonment
in
the
eyes
of
the
law.
i
might
add
that
only
last
year,
the
english
court
in
louis
versus
lillie,
i
give
you
a
citation
because
it's
not
in
the
brief,
30
english
reports
283,
made
a
--
the
same
decision.
now,
i'd
also
like
to
quote
very
briefly
from
lord's
stairs
institute,
this
is
a
book
which
dean
langdell
has
said
once
to
have
described
as
a
comparatively
recent
textbook
published
in
1681.
in
lord's
stairs
institute,
we
find
this
written,
"so
then,
it
is
not
the
consent
of
marriage
as
it
relateth
to
the
procreation
of
children
that
is
requisite,
for
it
may
consist,
though
the
woman
be
far
beyond
that
date,
but
it
is
the
consent
whereby
ariseth
that
conjugal
society
which
may
have
a
conjunction
of
bodies
as
well
as
of
minds,
has
the
general
end
of
the
institution
of
marriage,
which
is
the
solace
and
satisfaction
of
man."
in
a
case
just
a
few
years
ago,
baxter
versus
baxter
in
which
the
english
court
held
that
a
marriage
had
been
consummated
even
though
the
husband
refused
to
have
marital
intercourse
with
his
wife,
except
by
the
use
of
a
shield
--
sheath,
a
condom.
he
brought
an
action
on
the
ground
that
the
marriage
hadn't
been
consummated.
the
court
held
that
it
had
been
in
baxter
versus
baxter,
lord
--
chief
justice
jowitt
quoted
the
passage
which
i've
just
read
from
the
institutes
and
concluded
his
opinion
with
the
words,
"i
am
content
to
adopt
these
words
as
my
own,
so
too
are
these
appellants."
now,
your
honors,
what
has
dr.
buxton
to
say
to
mrs.
doe,
appellant
doe?
he's
to
say
to
mrs.
doe,
"yes,
i
have
warned
you
that
another
pregnancy
will
cause
you
your
life.
yes,
i
know
the
best
medical
treatment
for
you.
that's
sanctioned
by
all,
but
a
negligible
fraction
for
the
medical
profession.
but
i
cannot
so
prescribe,
the
law
forbids
it,
i
will
go
to
jail,
probably
lose
my
license
if
i
give
you
the
best
medical
advice
for
your
difficulties."
and
he
says,
"i
know
you're
only
27
years
old,
your
husband's
only
28.
well,
all
i
can
say
is
mrs.
doe,
the
home
is
good
a
wife
as
possible,
but
never
have
marital
intercourse
with
her
as
long
as
she'll
live."
and
the
poes
--
nothing
wrong
with
the
poes
except
something
wrong
with
the
genes.
the
reason
mrs.
poe
has
these
mentally
defective
children
is
because
of
some
genetic
problem,
which
the
specialists
have
not
been
able
to
diagnose
to
the
point
of
making
an
adequate
prognosis
and
cure.
now,
i
suppose
the
poes
have
suffered
about
the
cruelest
tragedies
that
any
married
couple
can
experience.
and
yet
they
are
deprived
of
what
men
in
all
ages
have
found
to
be
the
greatest
solace
for
life's
extreme
tragedies.
and
i
don't
suppose
to
be
much
of
a
consolation
to
mrs.
poe.
that
if
she
was
asked
to
read
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
errors
again,
when
the
court
said
that
"the
frailties
of
human
nature
and
the
uncertainties
of
passion
do
not
make
abstinence
an
unreasonable
or
impractical
alternative."
now,
to
go
further,
your
honors,
and
suggest
that
these
laws
mercilessly
invade
the
privacy
of
a
married
couple.
in
board
of
education
versus
barnette,
mr.
justice
jackson
pointed
out
the
flags
of
the
case.
mr.
justice
jackson
pointed
out
that
the
rights
that
these
children
wanted
to
assert
refusal
to
go
through
the
ceremony,
did
not
affect
the
rights
of
any
other
person
on
earth.
that
is
something
which
pertained
to
them
only
and
the
state.
his
exact
words,
the
freedom
asserted
by
these
appellees,
does
not
bring
them
into
collision
with
rights
asserted
by
any
other
individual.
it
is
such
conflicts
which
most
frequently
require
intervention
of
the
state.
but
the
refusal
of
those
persons
to
participate
in
the
ceremony
does
not
interfere
with
or
deny
rights
of
others
to
do
so.
the
sole
conflict,
mr.
justice
jackson
said,
is
between
authority
and
the
rights
of
the
individual.
and
so
here,
your
honors,
the
sole
conflict
is
between
naked
authority
and
the
rights
of
a
married
couple
to
live
a
normal
married
life
and
express
their
mutual
love
and
affection
to
each
other
in
a
way
that
couples
have
done
from
time
immemorial.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
well,
the
appellants
in
these
cases
have
not
asserted
the
--
the
right
to
practice
religion
because
as
far
as
we
know,
there's
nothing
inconsistent
that
these
laws
and
their
particular
religion,
so
far
as
we
know.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
it
certainly
is.
indeed
it
is
a
possible
one
because
as
almost
everyone
knows
now,
most
of
the
protestant
denominations
have
come
out
not
only
improving
artificial
birth
controls,
the
world
conference
of
churches
did
so
last
summer.
the
national
council
of
churches
did
so
last
week,
approving
of
artificial
birth
control
and
taking
the
position
that
it
is
the
moral
responsibility
of
children
--
the
moral
--
the
moral
responsibility
of
parents
to
be
responsible
in
the
number
and
spacing
of
their
children,
taking
into
consideration
by
many
things
such
as
the
health
of
the
mother
and
health
of
future
children
and
the
economic
and
social
environment
of
the
couple.
now,
actually,
there
is
a
conflict,
as
everyone
knows,
between
the
position
taken
by
the
majority
of
the
protestant
and
jewish
denominations
and
the
position
taken
by
the
roman
catholic
church.
this
is
our
conflict.
but
as
so
often
happens,
when
a
reasonable
man
came
far
up
to
the
areas
of
actual
agreement,
the
dispute
that
is
left
becomes
less
important
and
ranker
tends
to
disappear.
now,
what
do
we
have?
a
very
wide
area
of
agreement
between
these
two
tremendous
groups.
there
is
no
important
denomination
that
i
know
of
in
the
western
world
which
takes
the
position
that
absolute
control
of
conception
under
and
all
circumstances
is
wrong.
none.
the
catholic
church
does
not
take
that
position.
none
of
the
protestant
church
has
taken.
so
far
as
i
know,
none
of
the
jewish
denomination
has
taken.
now,
the
difference
comes
to
this.
the
protestant
denominations
take
the
position
that
contraception,
by
the
most
effective
means,
contraception
is
a
personal
matter,
a
matter
of
individual
choice,
to
put
it
in
terms
of
national
council
of
churches
before
god
in
prayer,
something
individual.
the
catholic
church
takes
the
position
that
--
well,
members
of
the
faith
are
required
to
follow
the
teachings
of
the
church
which
does
not,
in
unqualified
terms,
prevent
the
control
of
conception.
that
while
members
of
the
faith
should
follow
the
teachings
of
the
church,
there
are
very
loud
and
vigorous
spokesmen
today
by
catholic
scholars
and
members
of
the
catholic
hierarchy
who
take
the
position
that
it
is
immoral
and
it
would
be
immoral
for
either
group
to
force
by
compulsion
of
law
is
for
use
upon
the
other
group.
in
that,
your
honors,
i
think
this
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
it's
very
difficult,
your
honors,
to
claim
reasonable
for
a
law,
which
so
many
thoughtful
men
regard
as
immoral.
now,
insofar
as
there
are
supposedly
advantages
to
this
law,
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
there
are
practically
none.
so
far
as
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
concerned,
the
only
clue
we
have
from
the
legislative
history
is
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
obscenity.
because
the
law
was
enacted
in
1879
as
a
part
of
the
crusade
against
lewdness
and
obscenity,
a
part
of
the
comstock
and
(inaudible)
legislation,
but
now,
to
come
along
ways
so
far
to
use
mr.
justice
brennan's
phrase,
so
far
as
contemporary
community
standards
are
concerned,
you
come
a
long
way
since
the
victorian
prudery
of
1879.
contraception
is
no
longer
a
dirty
word.
now,
so
far
as
the
court's
concerned,
the
only
suggested
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
avoid
immorality,
namely,
licentious
sexual
relations,
presumably
between
unmarried
persons,
fornication,
possibly
adultery
occasionally.
now,
that
is
mentioned
in
two
of
the
opinions.
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
promote
morals
by
preventing
sexual
intercourse
between
unmarried
persons.
now,
the
law
does
not
accomplish
this
purpose
and
it
cannot
accomplish
it
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
is
not
unlawful
in
connecticut
for
a
person
to
use
a
contraceptive
device
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
disease.
the
court
has
cited
commonwealth
against
corbett
and
commonwealth
versus
rolinski,
the
massachusetts
case
which
so
decided,
under
their
law,
with
the
parent
approval.
and
there
is
cited
in
our
brief,
a
ruling
by
the
commissioner
of
drugs,
a
formal
ruling
in
a
letter
to
the
bridgeport
pharmaceutical
association
which
asked
the
question,
is
it
lawful
for
us
to
sell,
when
the
advice
of
the
--
prescription
of
a
physician
a
vaginal
diaphragm?
and
the
commissioner
of
drugs
made
the
formal
ruling
saying,
"yes,
it
has
therapeutic
purposes."
in
other
words
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
disease
or
other
therapeutic
purposes,
it
is
perfectly
alright
to
sell
the
most
effective
contraceptive
device
in
connecticut.
therefore,
it's
clearly
impossible
for
this
law
to
achieve
its
ends.
now
then,
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
does.
it
is
submitted
that
the
opinions
of
this
court
which
are
completely
dispositive
of
this
case.
in
butler
versus
michigan,
this
court
struck
down
a
law
prohibiting
the
sale
of
magazine
pictures
and
other
types
of
literature
tending
to
corrupt
the
morals
of
children.
they
struck
it
down
because
the
law
also
prevented
the
sale
of
such
literature
to
adults.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
opinion
in
that
case
for
this
court
said,
"law
goes
too
far."
it
reduces
the
reading
matter
for
the
adult
public
of
michigan
to
the
level
of
that
which
is
fit
for
children.
not
only
in
--
not
only
in
--
in
the
butler
case,
but
more
recently,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
shelton
case,
shelton
versus
tucker.
decided
this
term
in
discussing
the
listing
of
organizations
required
by
the
arkansas
statute
made
the
same
point.
the
statute,
he
said,
requires
the
person
to
list
without
number,
every
conceivable
kind
of
associational
tie.
many
such
relationships
could
have
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
teacher's
occupational
competence
or
fitness.
the
end,
he
held,
could
be
more
narrowly
achieved.
now,
what
does
this
law
do?
this
law,
in
order
to
prevent
fornication,
perhaps
in
occasional
case
of
adultery,
prevents
a
woman
who
is
likely
to
die
with
another
pregnancy
from
following
standard
medical
advice
in
obtaining
standard
medical
treatment.
in
addition,
this
law
prevents
married
couples,
every
married
couple
in
connecticut
are
deprived
the
right
of
sexual
intercourse
if,
for
any
reason,
if
for
any
reason,
the
health
of
mother
or
the
welfare
of
the
children
might
be
affected.
certainly,
this
is
to
burn
down
the
house
to
roast
the
pig,
throwing
a
baby
out
for
the
dishwater.
the
end
could
be,
could
obviously
be
achieved
by
much
lesser
means.
so,
your
honor,
it's
suggested
that
butler
versus
michigan
and
the
cases
following
it,
could
be
dispositive
of
this
case
on
an
area
ground
i
met
but
it
couldn't
be
dispositive
of
the
case.
now,
your
honors,
we
have
undertaken
the
burden
or
said
we're
willing
to
undertake
the
burden
of
demonstrating
upon
the
disadvantages
when
the
threat
to
life
and
personal
freedom
and
individual
liberty
are
weighed
against
the
so-called
advantages.
there's
no
reasonable
basis
for
these
laws
at
all.
now,
the
evils
of
abstinence
have
been
pointed
out
from
time
to
time.
it
has
been
said.
floyd,
i
quoted
in
the
brief,
has
said
many
years
ago
that
one's
sexual
passions
have
been
aroused,
in
connection
with
the
particular
person,
they
are
not
to
be
stilled
and
if
the
normal
outlet
is
stifled,
they
will
found
an
--
find
an
outlet
elsewhere.
therefore,
to
doom
young
people,
such
as
the
poes
and
the
does,
to
abstinence
is
to
invite
more
harm
than
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
by
the
contraceptive
statutes.
moreover,
in
the
brief,
we
have
cited
a
number
of
cases
in
which
abortions
are
the
result
of
unwanted
children.
abortions
are
the
result
of
children
who're
not
wanted.
and
that
they
there
show
that
most
of
the
abortions
performed,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
medical
--
in
british
medical
journal,
there's
an
article
cited
in
the
brief
indicating
that
90%
to
95%
of
the
abortion
performed
in
england
are
illegal.
and
the
opinions
of
the
best
experts
in
this
country
are
to
the
same
effect.
most
abortions
are
illegal.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
data
indicated
that
there
are
relatively
few
operations
admitted
to
the
presbyterian-columbia
hospital
and
the
bellevue
hospital
in
new
york,
for
illegal
abortions,
although
there
are
hundreds
of
women
who
were
brought
in
for
post
abortion
care,
as
a
result
of
illegal
abortions.
now,
it
also
happens,
that
the
data
show,
that
most
--
these
are
also
cited
in
the
brief,
most
abortions
are
performed
upon
married
women.
it
isn't
solely
a
matter
of
a
young
woman
finding
herself
unmarried
and
pregnant
who
are
the
victims
of
abortion.
most
abortions
are
upon
married
women
who
do
not
want
a
child.
in
psychiatric
evidence
also
cited
in
the
brief
indicates
quite
clearly,
quite
clearly
that
the
unwanted
child
is
one
of
the
most
unfortunate
of
human
beings.
as
dr.
manager
said,
"sometimes
the
unwanted
child
will
stimulate
a
certain
amount
of
love
and
affection
in
the
parents
plus
their
feeling
of
guilt
not
wanting
a
child."
but
he
says
the
parents
may
fool
themselves
and
they
may
fool
others
but
they
can
never
fool
the
child.
you
will
go
through
life
always
knowing
and
feeling
unverbalized,
though
it
maybe.
he
knows
that
somehow
he
was
unwanted
and
any
becomes
a
victim
of
all
the
prejudices,
racial,
social
and
otherwise
that
plagued
this
country.
now,
your
honors,
i
should
like
to
ask
my
colleague,
mrs.
pilpel
to
stress
some
points
which
i
have
not
been
able
to
reach.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
most
physicians
in
connecticut
--
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
your
honor,
i'm
ignorant
of
the
extent
to
which
law
is
enforced.
i
have
the
feeling
that
so
far
as
i
know
it
has
never
been
enforced
against
a
person
who
used
a
contraceptive
for
rather
obvious
reasons.
police
do
not
peek
into
people's
bedrooms
to
see
whether
they're
using
contraceptives.
and
people
do
not
go
into
a
drugstore
and
ask
for
a
box
of
condoms
with
the
statement
that
i'm
going
to
use
these
to
prevent
conception
rather
than
prevent
disease.
and
so
actually,
i
know
--
know
a
prosecution
of
an
individual
for
use.
although
there
have
been
prosecutions
of
physicians.
and
this
i
do
know
that
since
nelson
versus
state,
there
has
been
in
connecticut,
no
public
or
private
clinic
for
the
purpose
of
advising
on
contraceptions.
nelson
versus
state
was
a
death
knell
because
it
closed
the
clinic
which
dr.
nelson
was
operating.
there
have
been
nonsense
and
therefore,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
how
much
the
law
is
enforced,
put
it
this
way.
the
people
in
connecticut
who
need
contraceptive
advice
from
doctors
most,
the
people
in
the
lower
income
brackets
and
the
lower
education
brackets,
the
people
who
need
it
most
do
not
get
it
because
there
are
no
clinics
available.
mr.
fowler
v.
harper
there
is
no
statute
exactly
like
this,
your
honor,
in
any
state.
massachusetts
has
a
statute
which
comes
the
nearest
to
it.
massachusetts
forbids
the
sale
or
disposition
of
any
device
intended
to
prevent
conception.our
law
in
connecticut
prohibits
the
use
of
any
device.
