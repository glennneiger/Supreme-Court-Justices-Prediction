may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
petitioners
are
seeking
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
that
court
which
affirmed
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
dismissing
petitioner's
complaint
for
damages,
which
alleged
a
violation
of
revised
statute
section
1979,
which
is
a
portion
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
april
20th,
1871.
section
1979
of
course,
provides
that
every
person
who,
acting
under
color
of
law,
state
law,
violates
the
federal
constitutional
rights
of
any
other
person
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
shall
be
liable
in
an
action
at
law,
suit
in
equity
or
other
proper
proceeding
for
relief.
we
invoked
that
statute
in
our
complaint.
we
invoked
that
the
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1343,
subsection
3
which
explicitly
confers
original
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
district
courts
for
actions
of
the
type
defined
by
revised
statute
section
1979.
the
defendants
move
to
dismiss
our
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
failed
to
state
a
cause
of
action
and
the
district
judge
allowed
that
motion
dismissed,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
are
james
monroe,
his
wife
flossie
monroe,
and
their
six
children.
five
of
the
children,
i
might
add
are
named
stevens,
they
are
the
stepchildren
of
james
monroe,
the
children
of
flossie
monroe
by
a
prior
marriage.
all
six
children
of
course
are
the
children
of
flossie
monroe.
the
defendants
here
are
deputy
chief
of
detectives
frank
pape
of
the
chicago
police
department,
the
second
ranking
officer
in
the
detective
bureau
of
the
chicago
police
department,

john
does
whose
names
we
did
not
know
at
the
time
of
filing
of
the
complaint,
but
whom
we
alleged
were
officers
of
the
detective
bureau
acting
under
the
orders
of
the
detective
bureau
and
of
deputy
chief
pape.
finally,
the
city
of
chicago
was
named
as
a
party
defendant.
the
complaint
which
--
at
least
in
its
factual
allegations
must
be
taken
as
true
here,
i
suppose,
alleges
the
following
facts.
mr.
donald
page
moore
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
our
complaint
in
the
district
court
alleged
the
facts
in
count
1
and
it
alleged
the
following
facts.
on
october
the
29th
of
1958,
the
petitioner,
james
monroe,
his
wife,
who
was
also
a
petitioner,
flossie
monroe,
and
their
six
children,
who
were
also
petitioners
here,
were
at
home
in
their
chicago
apartment
asleep
in
their
beds,
and
at
05:45
that
morning,
the
respondent,
deputy
chief
of
detectives,
frank
pape
and
12
other
police
officers
from
the
detective
bureau
of
the
chicago
police
department
entered
their
--
entered
the
monroe
home
through
the
front
and
rear
doors.
chief
pape
and
two
other
officers
went
down
the
corridor
and
entered
the
monroe
bedroom.
at
that
point
mr.
and
mrs.
monroe
were
asleep
in
their
beds.
flashlights
were
shined
on
the
faces
of
mr.
and
mrs.
monroe.
one
of
the
officers
ordered
james
monroe
to
get
out
of
bed.
a
gun
was
pointed
at
mr.
monroe
when
this
command
was
given.
mr.
monroe
got
out
of
bed.
he
had
been
sleeping
with
no
clothes
on.
he
was
naked.
he
was
told
if
he
didn't
move
fast,
he
would
be
shot
and
he
was
told
to
get
into
the
living
room.
mr.
donald
page
moore
mr.
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
monroe
went
into
the
living
room.
he
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
living
at
the
command
of
the
police,
he
was
still
naked.
immediately
thereafter,
another
officer
ordered
mrs.
monroe
to
get
out
of
her
bed.
she
said
i
don't
want
to
do
it
because
i
don't
have
any
clothes
on.
i'm
paraphrasing
the
complaint
now.
the
officer
insisted
that
she
get
up.
he
grabbed
her
by
the
arm
and
started
to
pull
her
out
of
the
bed.
as
she
was
being
pulled
from
the
bed,
she
--
she
grabbed
a
blanket
off
--
off
the
top
of
the
bed
and
drew
it
in
front
of
her.
and
she
was
also
compelled
to
go
into
the
living
room.
at
about
the
same
time,
other
officers
were
awakening
the
six
monroe
children
and
herding
them
into
the
living
room.
meanwhile,
still
other
officers
began
an
exhaustive
search
of
the
premises.
it
commenced
in
the
monroe
bedroom
when
one
of
the
officers
went
into
the
closet
there
and
he
pulled
all
the
clothes
off
the
hangers,
examined
each
one
separately
and
threw
each
garment
on
the
floor.
still
other
officers
went
through
the
various
chests
of
drawers
and
other
pieces
of
furniture
in
the
apartment.
they
pulled
out
the
drawers,
they
dumped
them
on
the
floor,
and
i
suppose
we
may
infer
from
the
complaint
although
it
is
not
expressly
stated,
they
then
examined
the
various
articles
which
had
been
dumped
on
the
floor.
while
the
children
were
being
herded
into
the
living
room,
one
of
the
officers,
for
reasons
which
are
not
stated
in
the
complaint,
kicked
james
monroe,
jr.
who
is
a
four-year-old
child.
and
young
jimmy
monroe
fell
down
and
he
started
to
cry.
pape
was
in
the
living
room
at
this
point
and
he
was
addressing
questions
to
mr.
james
monroe.
pape
had
this
flashlight
in
his
hand
that
had
--
he
had
shone
in
the
faces
of
the
sleeping
couple
when
he
first
entered
the
bedroom.
and
as
the
deputy
chief
of
detectives
would
ask
these
questions
at
mr.
monroe,
he
was
striking
or
punching
this
flashlight
into
the
stomach
of
the
naked
man
while
his
children
and
his
wife
looked
on.
for
reasons
which
are
not
alleged
in
the
complaint,
one
of
the
officers,
i
believe
it
--
it
was
deputy
chief
pape,
had
occasion
to
strike
robert
stevens
who
was
the
stepchild
of
james
monroe
knocking
him
to
the
floor
and
thereafter
to
--
pushed
houston
stevens,
the
brother
of
robert
stevens,
down
to
the
floor
in
such
a
way
that
he
fell
across
robert's
body.
the
daughter
in
the
monroe
family,
jacqueline
stevens,
panicked
and
she
rushed
to
the
back
door.
an
officer
was
standing
near
the
backdoor.
he
stepped
in
front
of
jacqueline.
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
jacqueline's
intent
at
this
time
was
to
get
out
into
--
out
of
the
apartment
into
a
hallway
to
reach
a
telephone
so
that
she
might
call
someone
and
get
help.
the
officer
near
the
backdoor
stepped
in
front
of
her
and
pushed
her
down
to
the
floor.
the
officers
then
completed
an
exhaustive
search
of
the
premises.
this
included
among
other
things,
taking
razorblades
and
slitting
open
the
mattresses
on
the
various
beds
in
the
apartment
as
well
as
the
other
incidents
to
the
search
that
i
have
described.
after
some
time,
james
monroe
was
permitted
to
dress,
and
then
his
hands
were
cuffed
together
and
he
was
led
out
to
an
automobile
which
was
parked
near
the
apartment.
he
was
placed
in
the
automobile.
he
was
driven
eventually
to
the
central
police
headquarters
of
the
chicago
police
department
where
he
was
taken
up
to
a
place
of
detention.
and
he
was
there
interrogated
from
time
to
time,
subjected
to
intermittent
interrogation,
i
believe
it
is
the
way
it
was
phrased
in
the
complaint.
and
from
time
to
time,
he
was
placed
on
exhibition
in
police
line-ups
to
which
witnesses
and
other
police
officers
come
to
view
various
individuals
who
are
within
the
power
of
the
police
at
that
time.
after
10
hours,
mr.
monroe
was
released
from
custody.
he
was
not
charged
with
a
crime.
he
has
never
been
charged
with
a
crime
from
that
day
to
this.
it
was
alleged
that
during
this
10-hour
detention
at
the
central
police
headquarters,
mr.
monroe
was
refused
permission
to
call
his
family.
he
was
refused
permission
to
call
his
attorney.
no
charges
were
placed
against
him.
he
was
refused
any
information
as
to
what
charges
would
be
placed
against
him.
of
course,
he
could
not,
as
we
alleged
in
the
complaint,
make
bail
because
no
bail
had
been
set
because
no
charge
had
been
filed.
in
short,
the
allegations
make
out
a
classic
case
of
incommunicado
detention.
it's
the
same
thing
that
happens
in
all
of
these
cases
that
this
court
has
had
before
it
so
--
so
very
often
in
the
coerced
confession
situation.
we
alleged
that
the
officers
never
had
any
intent
of
bringing
mr.
monroe
before
a
judge
promptly
and
that
he
was
not
arrested
for
this
purpose.
we
further
alleged
that
in
the
building
where
mr.
monroe
was
held
for
this
10
hours,
there
were
four
branches
of
the
municipal
court
of
chicago
with
jurisdiction
to
receive
criminal
complaints
and
admit
prisoners
to
bail
and
that
elsewhere
in
the
city
there
were
16
other
branches
of
the
municipal
court
with
similar
jurisdiction,
and
we
have
identified
each
one
of
these
branches
by
number
in
the
complaint.
we
contend
that
having
alleged
these
facts,
and
specifically
invoked
title
28,
section
1343
to
support
federal
jurisdiction
and
revised
statute
section
1979,
which
defines
our
cause
of
action.
our
complaint
should
not
have
been
stricken
but
that
the
defendant
should
have
been
required
to
answer
it
and
we
should
have
proceeded
to
trial.
mr.
donald
page
moore
the
--
the
phrase
in
the
complaint,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that's
in
paragraph
10
(a)
of
the
complaint,
which
is
the
second
paragraph
on
page
3
of
the
record,
is
that
the
defendant,
"broke
and
entered
the
apartment".
now,
that
is
all
that
the
complaint
itself
says.
if
i
were
to
go
in
more
detail,
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
means
was
used
at
the
front
door
and
a
different
means
was
used
at
the
back
door.
i
think
it
couldn't
prejudice
the
defendants
if
i
informed
the
court
that
the
back
door
was
not
broken
down.
it's
conceivable
that
the
door
was
pounded
on
and
someone
came
and
that
somebody
said,
"police,
let
us
in",
in
the
case
of
the
back
door.
of
course,
that's
--
that's
the
words
of
the
record
but
i
don't
think
it's
prejudicial
to
the
city
since
it
negates
the
inference
that
the
back
door
was
broken
down.
we
believe
that
we
have
alleged
the
three
elements
which
are
required
by
revised
statute
section
1979
which
are
quite
simple.
first
of
all,
the
plaintiff
must
be
a
citizen
or
other
person
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
and
at
page
one
of
the
record,
paragraph
2
of
count
1
of
the
complaint,
we
alleged
that
the
plaintiffs
are
citizens
or
other
individuals
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
so
we
believe
that
we
have
satisfied
that
requirement
of
the
statute.
the
statute
requires
that
the
acts
complained
of
must
be
committed
under
color
of
a
state
law,
statute,
ordinance,
regulation,
custom
or
usage.
in
paragraph
6
of
the
complaint
on
page
2
of
the
record,
we
allege
that
the
defendants
were
acting
under
color
of
the
statutes,
ordinances,
regulations,
customs
and
usage
of
the
state
of
illinois,
county
cook,
city
of
chicago.
and
in
support
of
that
conclusion
we
have
alleged
in
paragraph
3
on
page
1
of
the
record
and
in
paragraphs
4,
5
and
7
at
page
2
of
the
record,
that
these
officers
were
on
duty,
they
were
acting
in
the
course
of
their
official
duty,
they
were
acting
subject
to
the
orders
of
the
detective
bureau,
that
they
were
led
by
a
deputy
chief
of
detectives,
that
they
were
acting
in
the
name
of
the
city
of
chicago
on
behalf
of
the
city
of
chicago,
that
they
were
carrying
official
badges
and
identification
cards
which
were
furnished
to
them
by
the
city
of
chicago
for
the
purpose
of
identifying
them
as
the
agents
of
the
city
of
chicago,
that
they
were
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment.
and
we
believe
that
this
makes
out
a
case
of
color
of
law
as
that
statutory
phrase
was
defined
in
screws
versus
the
united
states,
325
u.s.
and
williams
versus
the
united
states,
341
u.s.
and
we
contend
in
the
classic
case
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1940
or
1941.
screws
held
that
if
a
person
acts
under
pretense
of
law,
then
he
has
acted
under
color
of
law.
if
he
is
a
servant
of
the
state
going
about
the
state's
business,
he
has
acted
under
color
of
law
even
though
his
acts
may
be
in
violation
of
applicable
statutes
or
constitutional
provisions
of
the
state.
screws,
of
course,
was
a
case
where
a
georgia
sheriff
beat
a
negro
prisoner
to
death
and
it's
perfectly
clear
that
such
acts
were
a
violation
of
georgia
law.
nevertheless,
the
sheriff
was
held
to
have
acted
under
color
of
law
within
the
meaning
of
title
18,
section
242.
mr.
donald
page
moore
no
sir.
it
arose
under
18
u.s.c.
section
242
which
was
then,
i
believe,
section
20
of
the
old
criminal
code.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
however,
the
language
of
section
242,
which
is
where
the
screws
statute
is
now
found
in
the
code,
is
very
similar.
mr.
donald
page
moore
not
precisely,
your
honor.
for
example,
section
242
does
not
require
that
the
act
be
done
under
color
of
state
law,
if
memory
serves
me
correctly.
it
merely
says
under
color
of
law.
this
is
not
so
with
regard
to
revised
statute
section
1979
where
the
word
state
is
inserted.
however
the
--
outside
of
that,
i
believe
that
the
color
of
law
phraseology
of
section
242
is
precisely
the
same.
if
memory
serves
me
correctly,
there
are
two,
its
color
of
a
statute,
ordinance,
regulation,
custom,
or
usage.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
screws
case,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
believe
it's
in
a
footnote
at
page
99
of
325
u.s.,
the
two
sections
are
modeled
on
each
other.
i
forget
which
one
came
first.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
picking
against
pennsylvania
railroad,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
in
geach
against
moynahan
and
a
number
of
other
courts
of
appeals
have
inferred
from
this
footnote
in
the
opinion
of
justice
douglas
in
the
screws
case
that
the
two
provisions
are
in
pari
materia
at
least
on
the
color
of
law
provision.
we
can
see
no
distinction
between
this
case
and
screws,
between
this
case
and
williams,
which
was
a
case
where
a
special
police
officer
of
the
state
of
florida
participated
with
several
other
individuals
in
beating
a
confession
out
of
a
criminal
suspect
and
was
then
prosecuted
and
convicted.
this
court
affirmed
in
341
u.s.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
believe
that
--
that
this
is
a
valid
ground
for
distinguishing
the
cases.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
more
shocking,
not
less,
if
an
arrest
is
made
without
probable
cause,
and
that
the
operative
fact
in
each
instance
is
the
fact
that
the
individual
involved
is
acting
in
the
course
of
his
official
duties.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
--
i
would
assume,
although
i
do
not
know,
that
the
arrest
that
was
involved,
however,
in
williams
against
the
united
states
was
without
probable
cause.
i
--
i
seriously
doubt
that
the
law
of
florida,
which
was
the
state
in
which
the
facts
of
williams
occurred,
authorized
special
police
officers
and
other
individuals
to
arrest
a
person
and
instead
of
taking
him
to
a
jail
or
to
a
shed
or
to
a
police
lock-up
or
to
a
judge,
to
take
him
to
a
shed
on
the
premises
of
a
private
employer
and
there
conduct
a
fair
investigation.
now,
respondents
have
argued
that
screws
should
be
overruled.
i
think
that
this
would
not
be
a
good
idea.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
addition
to
what
we
have
stated
about
screws
in
our
reply
brief,
that
the
congress,
in
enacting
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960
at
page
--
at
section
601
(a)
of
the
act,
employed
the
color
of
law
phraseology
in
defining
the
duties
of
voting
referees.
one
of
the
duties
of
a
voting
referee
in
the
language
of
the
statute
is
to
report
to
the
federal
district
court
findings
as
to
whether
an
individual
has
been,
"deprived
or
denied
under
color
of
law
the
opportunity
to
register
to
vote".
this
seems
to
me
to
reinforce
our
contention
that
since
the
color
of
law
holding
in
screws
and
williams
is
simply
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation,
that
congress
could
have
changed
it
had
it
wished
to.
congress
did
not.
instead
congress
used
the
very
similar
phrase
that
was
defined
in
screws
and
in
williams
over
again,
just
this
year.
this
seems
to
me
a
congressional
ratification
of
this
court's
construction
of
that
phraseology
in
screws.
mr.
donald
page
moore
same
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
there
were
several
statutes
involved
in
williams,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
the
williams
case
to
which
our
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
both,
your
honor.
both
elements
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
unless
my
memory
is
playing
tricks
on
me,
your
honor,
in
williams
against
the
united
states
it
was
title
18,
section
242.
now,
in
united
states
against
williams,
it
was
section
241
was
involved.
and
of
course,
i
have
no
reference
to
that
case
because
that
involves
conspiracy.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
your
honor
knows
more
about
these
cases
than
i
do
when
i
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
that's
correct
your
honor,
341
u.s.
at
about
page
90.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that's
correct
but
wasn't
that
prosecution
under
section
242,
it
was
--
it
was
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
clearly
my
understanding
that
it
was
and
therefore
necessarily
in
holding
that
the
--
the
conviction
was
proper.
this
court
must
have
held
that
the
action
was
under
color
of
law.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
some
language
about
this
action
was
under
the
aegis.
i
recall
that
specific
word
in
the
majority
opinion
of
state
authority
and
it
was
part
of
–
and
that
the
special
police
officer
involved
there
had
a
semblance
of
official
authority
under
florida
law
because
he
was
in
a
different
position
from
a
private
citizen
under
florida
law.
so,
if
my
recollection
is
correct
then
the
prosecution
was
under
section
242.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
i
would
--
i
would
say
that
there
might
be
a
difference
but
it's
a
difference
which
is
irrelevant
given
this
course
--
court's
holdings
in
screws
and
williams.
and
i
would
urge
that
regardless
of
the
opinion
which
anyone
may
have
now
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
majority
holdings
in
screws
and
williams
nevertheless
by
failing
to
change
the
statute
although
this
court
specifically
suggested
that
if
congress
disagreed,
it
could
change
the
statute.
by
failing
to
change
it,
congress
has
in
effect
ratified
the
holding
in
screws
and
by
using
the
same
terminology
or
something
very
closely
akin
to
it
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1960,
congress
has
even
more
explicitly
ratified
or
endorsed
the
holding
in
screws.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
not
necessarily
your
honor
but
--
but
the
language
that
the
court
used
in
the
screws
case
is
highly
suggestive.
it
said
at
pages
112
to
113,
“we're
not
dealing
constitutional
interpretations
which
throughout
the
history
of
the
court
and
wisely
remained
flexible
and
subs
--
subject
to
frequent
reexamination,
the
meaning
which
the
classic
case
gave
to
the
phrase
under
color
of
any
law
involved
only
a
construction
of
the
statute.
hence
if
it
states
a
rule
undesirable
in
its
consequences,
congress
can
change
it
and
our
contention
is
congress
did
not.
instead
it
used
the
same
phrase
all
over
again
in
a
new
section
of
the
same
statute.
this
certainly
does
not
indicate
any
congressional
hostility
to
the
holding
in
screws
on
that
point.
finally,
the
constitutional
violation
which
is
the
third
requisite
to
a
cause
of
action
under
the
statute,
we
believe
is
supplied
by
the
allegation
of
the
facts
coupled
with
the
allegation
at
record
page
9,
count
1,
paragraph
18
that
the
aforesaid
acts
of
the
defendants
constitute
a
violation
of
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
in
that
plaintiffs
and
each
of
them
were
deprived
by
the
defendants
in
each
of
them
of
their
right
to
be
secure
in
their
home
against
arbitrary
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures.
we
invoke
the
unanimous
holding
of
this
court
in
wolf
against
colorado
which
was
reaffirmed,
vigorously
reaffirmed
by
a
majority
of
this
court
in
the
decision
of
last
june,
elkins
against
united
states
and
we
further
note
that
even
the
dissenters
in
elkins,
i
do
not
repudiate
wolf
rather,
if
memory
serves
me
correctly,
they
--
they
thought
wolf
meant
a
little
different
something
but
nobody
indicated
that
wolf
should
be
overrule.
and
wolf,
this
court
held
that
an
unreasonable
search
or
seizure
by
a
state
officer,
at
least
did
the
search
or
seizure
violated
the
core
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth.
and
in
elkins
of
course,
this
court
said
that
in
wolf
we
unequivocally
and
unanimously
held
that,
“unreasonable
searches
or
seizures
by
state
officers
violates
fourteenth
amendment
due
process.”
now,
it
--
it
seems
to
us
that
we
have
simple
statute.
it
lays
out
three
things
which
we
must
allege.
we
have
alleged
them
all
unless
screws
and
williams
are
repudiated
or
unless
wolf
and
elkins
are
repudiated
then
we
have
stated
a
cause
of
action
against
the
individual
officers.
of
course,
we
have
gone
further
and
we
have
alleged
that
the
city
of
chicago
is
liable.
we
have
–
and
they
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
that
--
well,
what
happened
here
was
simply
something
done
in
the
course
of
--
the
performance
of
the
governmental
function
and
therefore
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law
and
impliedly
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
we
are
immune
from
tort
liability.
and
this
of
course
is
--
is
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
rearing
its
weathered
head
in
this
case.
we
--
we
start
with
the
premise
that
there
is
no
question
but
what
congress
has
the
power
if
it
chooses
to
make
a
municipality
liable
for
the
fourteenth
amendment
violations
of
its
police
officers
acting
within
the
scope
of
their
employment,
on
behalf
of
the
municipality.
and
in
our
brief,
we
invoked
the
opinion
of
chief
justice
stone
in
united
states
against
california,
297
u.s.
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
california
against
the
united
states,
320
u.s.
where
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
implicit
in
those
cases.
indeed
it
is
exquisite.
the
first
california
case
involved
$100
statutory
penalty
under
the
safety
appliance
act
against
the
state
of
california
for
mis-running,
one
of
its
railroads
in
some
particulars.
the
second
california
case
involved
whether
--
the
question
whether
the
state
of
california
was
subject
to
the
shipping
act
to
1916.
in
each
instance,
the
state
of
california
said,
"we're
a
sovereign.
we're
immune."
it
further
said,
"we're
not
specifically
named
in
the
statute
therefore
it
doesn't
apply
to
us."
the
court
aptly
remarked
that
these
were
federal
statutes
that
california
was
not
the
enacting
sovereign.
there's
never
been
a
presumption
that
a
political
subdivision
is
not
to
be
included
within
a
liability
frame
by
a
statute
unless
that
political
unit
was
the
enacting
sovereign.
and
in
each
instance,
it
held
that
the
state
of
california
was
subject
to
the
statute.
then
we
go
on,
assuming
the
congressional
power
to
do
this
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
adopting
the
act
of
april
20,
1871,
congress
did
make
municipalities
liable.
we
suggest
first
that
the
doctrine
of
respondeat
superior
which
is
very
old,
which
is
very
socially
useful
and
which
is
something
that
--
that
lawyers
absorbed
into
their
bloodstreams
with
their
first
law
school
course
in
torts
is
implicit
in
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
is
implicit
in
the
civil
rights
act
which
was
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
with
the
title,
“an
act
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.”
the
fourteenth
amendment
prohibits
action
by
states.
congress
passed
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
don't
--
unless
its
--
i
don't
know
that
it
follows
qed
but
we
suggest
that
therefore
it
make
sense
at
least
prima
facie
to
hold
that
the
civil
rights
act
to
1871
is
applicable
to
the
subdivisions,
the
corporate
subdivisions
of
a
state.
we
go
further,
we
--
we
point
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
of
1871
and
we
point
to
the
language
of
representative
shellabarger
who
was
the
principal
sponsor
of
the
1871
act
where
he
says
that
this
act
is
remedial,
it's
an
aid
of
human
liberty,
it
is
to
be
construed
liberally.
that's
at
page
23
of
our
brief.
representative
shellabarger
said
the
largest
latitude
consistent
with
the
words
employed
is
uniformly
given
in
construing
in
effect
such
statutes
as
this.
this
was
the
opening
speech
in
the
debate
on
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
by
its
sponsor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
on
--
on
this
subject
of
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
no,
your
honor.
we
found
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
no,
we
found
much
more
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
your
honor.
this
is
all
we
found
on
the
question
of
what
the
congressman
thought
about
whether
this
act
was
remedial
or
penal.
mr.
donald
page
moore
specifically
your
honor,
i
--
i
would
call
your
attention
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
i
did
your
honor
and
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes
sir.
at
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
pages
29
to
30
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes.
in
the
footnotes
your
honor
at
page
30,
we
discussed
the
sherman
amendment
to
which
you
have
reference
and
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
but
an
entirely
different
situation.
in
that
footnote,
we
also
explained
why
we
think
the
sherman
amendment
is
not
relevant
to
this
statute.
mr.
donald
page
moore
if
--
in
the
--
the
sherman
amendment
was
an
amendment
which
was
thrown
in
at
the
last
minute
by
senator
sherman
of
ohio
after
the
act
of
april
28th
that
had
already
passed
the
statute
and
as
congress
was
driving
toward
adjournment.
senator
sherman
sought
to
introduce,
did
introduce
and
the
senate
adopted
an
amendment
to
the
statute
which
provided
that
the
victims
of
the
mob
violence
of
private
individuals
might
have
a
remedy
in
action
against
“every
city,
county
or
parish”
in
which
the
damage
occurred.
it
could
have
a
remedy
against
the
city
or
county.
the
senate
adopted
this
amendment.
the
house
rejected
it,
refused
to
concur.
the
senate
adopted
it
again.
the
house
again
not
concurred,
whereupon
a
substitute
measure
which
became
revised
statute
section
1981
was
put
in
there.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
but
the
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
at
least
one
speaker
your
honor
and
that
is
representative
or
rather
senator
stevenson
of
kentucky.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
your
honor.
they
--
the
speeches
centered
around
the
notion
that
--
that
some
of
the
representatives
had
that
this
would
be
a
violation
of
governmental
immunity
to
taxation.
however,
most
of
the
speeches
were
directed
to
the
obvious
unconstitutionality
at
least
to
some
of
the
congressman,
it
was
obvious,
of
giving
a
federal
remedy
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
action
--
for
damages
suffered
as
result
of
action
which
was
not
state
action
but
which
was
private
action.
and
some
of
the
congressman
i
believe
pointed
out
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
it
prohibited
only
state
action.
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
course
says
no
state
shall
and
most
of
the
barrage
of
criticism
which
the
sherman
amendment
faced
was
based
not
only
on
this
constitutional
objection,
but
on
--
on
the
obvious
injustice
or
what
seemed
to
them
the
obvious
injustice
are
subjecting
the
city
to
liability
for
actions,
not
of
persons
over
whom
the
city
had
direction
and
control
but
over
private
individuals
who
were
not
the
employees
of
the
city
and
not
subject
to
it's
disciplinary
controls
in
the
same
sense
that
a
police
officer
may
make.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
i
--
your
honor,
yes,
because
i
don't
believe
what
your
honor
has
said
quite
correctly
characterizes
this
serious
debate.
i
would
point
out
first
of
all
that
the
people
who
were
up
in
arms
about
the
sherman
amendment.
and
again
the
sherman
amendment
is
a
very
different
thing
from
section
1
of
that
act.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
it
did.
mr.
donald
page
moore
it
certainly
was,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
that
--
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
however,
i
would
point
out
that
the
people
who
made
this
objection
where
people
who
were
opposed
to
the
civil
rights
bill
as
a
whole
altogether
and
i
would
point
to
the
language
of
justice
douglas
for
the
court.
mr.
donald
page
moore
they
yielded
to
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
i
think
not
your
honor
because
--
you
know
you
can
point
to
a
particular
statement
by
any
one
individual
in
that
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
much
more
important
than
the
remarks
of
a
dissident
democratic
opponent
of
the
act
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
they
were
yielded
to
with
regard
only
to
the
sherman
amendment
which
was
directed
at
private
action
by
private
individuals.
we
cannot
look
into
the
minds
of
the
individuals
who
went
along
with
the
objections
to
the
sherman
amendment
and
assume
that
they
picked
up
isolated
statements
by
senator
stevens
--
stevenson
and
relied
on
nothing
else
in
the
entire
debate
because
there
were
policy
objections
to
municipal
liability
for
private
individuals.
there
were
all
sorts
of
constitutional
objections
of
which
this
was
only
one.
and
it
was
not
stressed
into
the
debate
nearly
so
much
as
the
--
as
these
other
questions.
mr.
donald
page
moore
i'm
--
i
do
not
understand
the
question
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
yes,
yes,
we
do
encounter
those
objections
most
articulately
stated
by
senator
stevenson.
but,
they
weren't
everybody's
objections
and
they
weren't
on
section
1
of
the
bill
which
is
our
section.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
the
remarks
of
the
opponents
of
a
bill
–
well,
we
cited
the
schwegmann
brothers
case.
now,
that
is
not
precisely
applicable
because
here,
the
opponents
did
prevail
on
the
amendment
but
that
is
a
very
different
thing
from
assuming
that
congress
without
saying
so,
met
that
there
was
to
be
no
municipal
--
municipal
liability
anywhere.
no
congressman
for
or
against
the
bill
ever
said
that
there
could
be
no
municipal
liability
under
section
1
of
the
bill
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
representative
shellabarger
who
i
supposed
we
must
assume
was
more
carefully
listened
to
than
any
other
congressman
who
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
supported
--
sir?
mr.
donald
page
moore
because
he
made
the
lead
off
speech
and
as
you
go
through
that
legislative
history,
shellabarger
keeps
popping
up
to
answer
questions.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
it's
--
it's
possibly
your
honor.
i
don't
suppose
we
can
prove
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
donald
page
moore
i
would
however
point
out
to
the
court
that
that
congress
did
one
thing
that
the
congress
as
a
whole
articulated
one
thing
just
about
seven
weeks
before
it
passed
the
act
of
april
28,
1871
when
it
adopted
on
february
the
25th,
1871,
“an
act
to
prescribe
the
form
of
the
enacting
and
resolving
clauses
of
acts
of
congress
and
rules
for
the
construction
thereof.”
this
statute
among
other
things
defines
certain
general
terms.
it
has
been
referred
to
on
occasion
as
the
act
of
congress
in
--
in
prescribing
its
own
dictionary
in
the
article
by
justice
frankfurter
in
47
columbia
law
review.
this
dictionary
statute
said
among
other
things
that
the
word
person
maybe
construed
to
apply
to
bodies
corporate
and
politic
unless
the
context
otherwise
indicates
or
unless
the
text
otherwise
indicated.
it's
a
--
the
grandchild
in
that
statute
now
says
conte
--
context
then
it
said
text.
now
our
basic
position
is
this.
the
act
makes
every
person
liable.
the
congress
said,
a
person
maybe
construed
to
include
bodies
politic
and
corporate
everybody
in
1871
who
had
any
legal
training
whatsoever
must
have
assumed
that
bodies
politic
and
corporate
meant
cities
in
our
appendix
d
to
this
complaint.
we've
listed
a
whole
rap
of
the
statutes,
creating
cities,
we
quoted
one,
creating
scottsboro,
alabama.
and
we
listed
a
whole
rap
of
other
ones
and
every
single
one
of
this
statute
says
that
the
city
of
chi
--
of
scottsboro
shall
be
a
body
politic
and
corporate
with
power
to
sue
and
be
sued.
when
they
used
those
words
bodies
politic
and
corporate
they
must
have
been
thinking
inter
alia
at
least
of
cities.
and
they
used
the
word
person
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
therefore
clearly,
this
court
meant
without
doing
violence,
i
suggest
to
the
history
of
--
of
--
that
session
in
the
congress
which
happened
1871,
hold
that
person
here
means
body
politic
and
corporate,
i.e.
cities.
city
of
chicago
was
created
as
a
bodies
politic
and
corporate
back
in
the
1830s.
it's
still
a
bodies
politic
and
corporate.
now,
we
have
this
and
we
have
the
further
question
which
is
more
significant
it
seems
to
me
which
is
raised
by
the
prior
holding
of
this
court
in
the
holmes
against
city
of
atlanta
and
douglas
against
the
city
of
jeannette,
where
implicit
in
those
cases
is
a
holding
the
municipal
corporations
can
be
made
parties-defendant
in
an
action
under
revised
statute
section
1979.
both
of
those
cases
were
actions
under
revised
statutes
section
1979,
equity
actions.
in
both
of
those
cases
it
was
held
explicitly
in
the
opinion,
douglas
against
the
city
of
jeannette
and
by
necessary
implication
in
the
holmes
case
where
this
court
merely
entered
a
short
order
affirming
that
a
city
was
subject
to
the
provisions
of
revised
statute
section
1979.
that
must
mean
that
a
city
is
within
the
phraseology
every
person
because
the
act
makes
every
person
liable
to
an
action
at
law,
suit
in
equity
or
other
proper
proceeding
for
redress.
if
the
defendant
is
not
a
person,
you
have
no
cause
of
action
under
the
act
i
would
suggest.
and
yet
everyone
has
always
assumed
that
a
municipal
corporation
is
liable
--
in
an
action
in
equity
or
an
injunction
under
this
section
of
the
statute.
how
can
--
it
--
its
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
you
can
hold
that
a
city
is
a
person
in
equity
and
not
a
person
at
law
particularly
difficult
when
we
look
back
to
what
the
sponsor
said,
the
statute
is
remedial
in
its
purpose
to
be
construed
liberally.
we
are
to
give
it
the
largest
latitude
consistent
with
the
words
employed.
then
we
looked
to
the
dictionary
statute
where
congress
has
expressly
said
that
when
we
use
this
word
unless
the
text
of
the
statute
indicates
otherwise.
it
may
be
construed
to
indicate
a
body
politic
and
corporate.
view
--
viewed
in
conjunction
--
viewed
in
conjunction
with
the
contemporary
understanding
of
the
word
person
which
we
have
outlined,
the
--
the
first
case
so
far
as
i
know
under
this
statute
was
north
western
fertilizing
company
against
the
village
of
hyde
park
in
which
a
district
judge
sitting
right
in
chicago
held
that
a
corporation
was
a
person
who
can
bring
suit
because
otherwise
it
could
not
be
a
person
for
purposes
of
being
a
defendant.
and
i
might
also
point
out
that
the
defendant,
the
north
western
fertilizing
company
was
in
fact
a
municipal
corporation,
it
was
the
village
of
hyde
park
which
is
of
course
now
is
part
of
chicago
but
what
it
was
then
a
village
and
that
nobody
even
suggested
that
it
wasn't
a
--
that
it
wasn't
a
person
for
purposes
of
being
a
defendant
in
that
action.
again
it
was
an
action
in
equity
and
not
law
of
course.
now,
all
we're
suggesting
here
is
that
on
the
law
--
on
the
technical
history
of
the
phraseology
of
this
act,
there
is
ambiguity
that
--
that
there
is
room
here
for
this
court.
there
is
sufficient
ambiguity,
sufficient
doubt
so
that
this
court
can
look
to
the
policy
factors
which
inherent
in
a
claim
of
sovereign
immunity,
a
claim
of
immunity
from
a
particular
statute
of
the
united
states
by
the
city
of
chicago
and
we
have
gone
on
at
some
length
for
this
reason
on
the
policy
issues
which
are
at
stake.
we
have
pointed
out
that
this
court
has
consistently
criticized
the
doctrine
that
every
legal
scholar
publishing
anywhere
in
this
country
today,
there
maybe
exceptions
but
i
don't
know
of
them,
has
attacked
the
doctrine
because
it's
unfair,
because
it
works
terrible
injustice.
because
a
--
because
a
family
like
the
family
of
james
monroe
has
no
remedy
that
means
anything
unless
it
can
sue
the
city
of
chicago.
the
civil
damage
provisions
of
that
statute
do
not
mean
a
thing
unless
there
is
a
financially
responsible
defendant
in
the
case,
when
as
lawyers
generally
speaking
will
not
represent
clients
unless
they
can
make
money
doing
it.
if
a
plaintiff's
lawyer
can
make
money,
bringing
actions,
a
cause
of
actions
can
be
an
immense,
an
immensely
effective
tool
of
public
policy.
one
has
to
look
only
at
the
--
at
the
federal
employers'
liability
act
to
see
how
plaintiff's
lawyers
because
they
know
they
can
hit
for
money
have
gone
out,
they've
gone
after
these
cases
and
they
brought
these
actions
and
as
a
result
to
the
verdicts
they're
getting,
the
railroads
have
evolved
immense
safety
programs.
mr.
donald
page
moore
what
i
mean
your
honor
is
that
they
--
that
they
have
sat
in
their
offices
and
been
alert
when
these
cases
came
to
them.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well
that
is
correct
your
honor
but
i
think
--
we
submit
that
injury
suffered
by
railroad
workers
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
of
his
employer
are
no
more
important,
no
more
hurtful
socially
than
injury
suffered
by
innocent
individuals
as
a
result
of
the
unconstitutional
acts
of
local
police
officers.
the
--
the
lawyers
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
it
makes
this
very
practical
difference
your
honor
and
--
and
i
think
this
is
important.
a
guilty
defendant
at
least
in
many
insistencies
has
a
forum
in
which
he
try
out
the
question
of
right
in
their
home
law
in
is
area
of
procedural
due
process
as
it
respects
actions
of
police
officers
is
made
in
cases
mostly
where
defendants
are
guilty
that
they're
trying
to
suppress
evidence,
they're
trying
to
suppress
confessions.
at
least
and
i
think
this,
a
not
inconsiderable
value,
at
least
a
murderer
from
whom
a
confession
is
extorted
has
the
satisfaction,
if
his
lawyer
is
good
and
his
trial
is
fair
of
--
of
having
someone
say
what
has
been
done
to
him
is
wrong.
having
it
said
formally
and
officially.
i
--
i
believe
professor
carl
talks
about
the
sense
of
justice
which
is
important
and
which
is
satisfied
by
a
formal
official
determination
(inaudible)
an
innocent
person
doesn't.
an
innocent
person
is
bereft
of
any
practical
remedy
because
--
if
as
usually
happens,
he's
poor,
he
can't
get
a
lawyer.
if
he
is
poor,
the
states
attorney,
the
prosecuting
authorities
are
not
going
to
pay
much
attention
to
him
usually.
and
he
is
not
charged
with
anything.
there
is
nothing
to
suppress.
if
this
family
has
no
remedy
here,
and
this
means
an
effective
remedy.
then
for
practical
purposes
it
has
no
remedy
at
all.
now
i
think
there
is
sufficient
ambiguity
in
the
background
of
the
statute
so
that
this
court
may
without
engaging
in
broad
side
legislation
which
of
course
he
cannot
do.
so
that
it
may
consider
these
policy
factors.
it
has
certainly
considered
them
in
other
cases
for
example
in
united
states
against
the
amp
trucking
company,
this
court
considered
policy
factors
when
it
read
respondeat
superior
into
a
criminal
statute.
although
respondeat
superior
was
not
written
in
the
language
of
the
statute
and
it
used
--
it
used
as
part
of
the
support
for
its
reasoning
and
imposing
what
the
dissenters
called
vicarius
criminal
liability
as
part
of
its
support,
it
referred
again
to
this
dictionary
statute.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
in
encouraging
employers
to
police
their
employees
is
this
important
in
the
area
of
complying
with
the
interstate
commerce
act,
it
is
this
important
in
the
area
of
protecting
the
fundamental
civil
liberties
of
four
individuals
who
are
not
going
to
get
protected
under
other
circumstances.
and
it
seems
to
me
i
again
that
this
court
can't
--
has
enough
leeway
in
the
background
of
the
statute
so
that
it
can
consider
this
policy
considerations.
i
would
like
if
the
court
please
to
save
5
minutes
for
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
page
moore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
to
court.
i
will
not
respond
to
any
of
the
contentions
of
--
of
the
respondents.
i
think
that
underlying
the
--
the
issues
in
this
case
of
course
is
an
issue
of
federalism
of
--
of
federal
state
relations
and
i
think
basically
an
issue
of
judicial
philosophy.
i
--
and
on
these
two
basic
issues,
i
would
like
to
suggest
what
i
have
thought
about
in
the
--
almost
two
years
we've
been
working
on
this
case.
it
--
it
seems
to
me
first
of
all
that
on
the
federalism
issue,
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
the
position
for
which
we
are
contending
is
not
a
position
which
if
taken
will
violate
or
detract
from
any
legitimate
public
interest
of
any
state.
indeed,
if
the
states
are
able
to
secure
the
assistance
of
federal
judges
and
federal
juries
in
supporting
their
articulated
public
policies,
i
am
sure
that
they
will
be
happy
and
not
unhappy
because
every
state
constitution
forbids
what
has
occurred
here.
secondly,
i
--
i
would
like
to
stress
--
we
so
often
think
that
--
i
so
often
think,
that
of
a
person
who
goes
into
a
court
and
argues
for
a
civil
liberties
position
is
--
is
often
thinking
--
thought
of
a
person
who
--
who
is
going
in
and
pleading
for
a
kind
of
judicial
activism,
for
judicial
conduct
which
is
really
policy
making,
which
is
legislating,
which
is
imposing
the
--
the
subjective
preferences
of
the
judges
upon
the
rest
of
society.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
our
whole
position
here
is
not
one
which
calls
for
this
kind
of
judicial
activity
but
is
--
we
are
pleading
here,
it
seems
to
me,
on
the
most
important
issues
in
the
case
were
judicial
self-restraint.
we
are
saying
whatever
you
may
think
of
this
statute
or
of
the
philosophy
which
called
this
statute
into
being,
nevertheless,
congress
did
make
the
decision,
and
this
congressional
will
should
be
respected
and
it
seems
to
me
that
insofar
as
we
are
calling
for
what
must
be
called
legislation
in
this
case,
we
are
calling
for
interstitial
legislation.
we
are
calling
for
the
court
to
make
a
decision
on
this
issue
of
municipal
liability
where
congress
has
not
expressly
stated
anything
one
way
or
the
other
and
where
whichever
way
this
issue
was
decided.
legislation
will
be
done,
law
will
be
made
and
we
can
only
point
to
the
congress
which
enacted
the
bill
to
the
tradition
in
which
that
congress
acted.
and
ask
the
court
as
it
was
of
course
has
been
often
asked
in
the
past,
to
feel
in
terms
of
our
case
the
thrust
of
that
tradition.
now,
if
the
suggestion
of
course
is
that
that
tradition
was
anti-southern
or
pro-negro
or
something
like
that.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
our
appendix
b,
subsection
1.
we
anticipated
the
argument
in
which
we've
laid
out
about
15,
maybe
not
that
many,
maybe
only
10
quotes
in
the
legislative
history
on
this
precise
issue.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court
--
court's
attention
to
the
tradition
that
must
have
been
felt
by
--
by
representative
beckley
the
initial
quote
in
that
subsection.
when
he
said
this
bill
is
not
to
protect
republicans
only
in
their
property
rights,
liberties
and
applies
with
democrats
as
well,
not
the
colored
only
but
the
white
also.
yes,
even
women
and
children
and
all
classes
will
be
benefited
the
like
because
we
are
simply
contented
for
good
government
and
righteous
law
and
down
the
line
it
goes.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
your
honor,
we
know
what
that
congress
thought
was
righteous.
mr.
donald
page
moore
surely
we
do
because
they
told
us
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
your
honor.
mr.
donald
page
moore
i'd
love
to
answer
that
que
--
i'm
dying
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
but
my
light
is
on.
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
it's
--
it
--
it's
hard
to
--
to
describe
the
whole
history
of
these
enactments
and
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
that's
my
quote,
however,
your
honor
not
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
--
of
congress.
mr.
donald
page
moore
your
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
i
think
--
i
think
your
honor
with
all
respect
that
i
do
not.
mr.
donald
page
moore
i
--
i
point
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
donald
page
moore
well,
hear
me
out
your
honor.
i
point
to
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
which
historically
has
been
labeled
a
ku
klux
klan
act,
an
act
against
mass
bands
of
violent
men,
and
i
asked
you
how
any
congressman
could
have
possibly
thought
that
any
state
in
this
nation
would
ever
authorize
by
its
laws,
the
actions
of
this
mobs
and
yet
obviously,
at
least
where
there
were
some
collaboration
between
officers
of
the
state
and
this
mass
bands
obviously
congress
intended
to
hit
that.
mr.
donald

moore
not
merely
with
mob
rule
your
honor
but
in
part,
it
was
also
your
honor
directed
and
some
of
its
people
said
so,
some
of
it
supporters
said
so.
mr.
donald
page
moore
your
honor,
with
all
respect,
i
believe
that
that
is
not
an
accurate
characterization
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
of
april
28th,
1871.
we
must
turn
to
the
globe
of
course.
mr.
donald

moore
your
--
your
honor,
with
all
respect
and
i
hate
to
disagree
with
your
honor.
mr.
donald

moore
but

this
is
not

is
not
a
correct
characterization

mr.
