because
does
--
screws
--
the
screws
case
arise
under
the
statute
we're
now
considering?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
it
the
same?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
the
statute
in
--
in
williams?
justice
felix
frankfurter
it's
not
the
same
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
williams
case
to
which
you
referred
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
what
was
the
--
what
was
the
statute?
was
that
a
statute
of
color
of
law
or
a
state
action?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
it's
different.
they're
different
phrases,
with
different
history.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
(inaudible).
i
was
referring
to
your
williams
case
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
which
was
not
a
color
of
law
but
a
state
--
involved
that
is
something
that's
state
action
and
those
were
different
concepts.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
you
--
you
should've
read
them
all
recently.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
between
purporting
to
act
under
the
authority
of
a
statute
to
which
maybe
bad
and
purporting
to
act
under
color
of
law
which
has
been
defined
from
the
state
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
when
we
get
a
permission
to
congress
to
change
the
law
and
they
don't
accept
our
offer
that
shows
they've
rejected
it,
is
that
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
--
is
that
all
you
found
in
the
legislative
history
on
this
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
under
the
specific
question
whether
municipalities
are
to
be
made
liable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
all
you
found?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
i
mean,
specifically?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
found
detailed
legislative
history
dealing
with
this
various
subject?
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
you
--
did
you
set
that
forth
in
your
brief?
justice
felix
frankfurter
where?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
did
you
set
forth
the
origin,
the
original
statute
which
had
a
provision
in
--
then
which
--
which
was
not
concurred
in
by
the
house
and
all
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
specifically
granted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i
--
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
leaving
out
all
reference
to
municipalities.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
speeches
against
--
even
the
constitutionality
of
that
along
the
wisdom
of
imposing
this.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
true?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
the
house,
wasn't
there
serious
speeches
against
this
liability?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
you
think
a
general
remarked
by
congressman
shellabarger
of
--
about
construing
this
thing
liberally
is
more
controlling
and
more
helpful
to
this
court
to
consider
than
the
serious
debates
which
referenced
the
municipal
liability
around
--
against
it,
not
only
on
constitutional
grounds
but
on
grounds
that
followed
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
but
it
did
deal
with
municipal
liability.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
subject
was
raised.
justice
felix
frankfurter
objection
was
made
to
holding
a
municipal
liable
--
municipality
liable
for
anything.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
their
objection
prevailed
and
those
who
sponsored
the
civil
rights
amendment
yielded
to
those
objections.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
still
more
significant,
not
less
significant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that's
what
you
did
when
quoted
shellabarger's
general
remark.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
what
the
dissident's
objections
were
yielded
to?
justice
felix
frankfurter
your
reading
of
the
debate
--
on
your
reading
of
the
debate,
would
you
deny
that
there
were
policy
objections
to
holding
the
municipality
at
all.
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
--
does
your
reading
of
the
debates
in
both
houses
not
encounter
objections
to
holding
the
municipality
at
all
liable?
justice
felix
frankfurter
pardon
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
isn't
that?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
he
tried
them
by
popping
up
to
answer
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
what
i
was
suggesting.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
didn't
decide
--
i
didn't
decide
anything
on
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

applied
all
in
the
northern
state?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
mean,
this
--
does
this
statute
only
applies
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
let
me
ask
you
a
question.
suppose
that
the
legislature
of
illinois
passed
a
statute
which
set
forth
in
detail
what
was
done
in
this
court,
was
charged
in
the
complaint
had
said
any
police
officer
may
do
the
following
acts
and
then
set
forth
what
was
done
in
that
complaint.
then
the
police
officer
go
there
and
acts
under
that
statute,
is
that
somewhere
in
the
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
righteous
law,
that's
a
very
simple
thing
to
apply
automatically,
you
can
always
know
where
a
law
is
righteous,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
do?
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
really
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
a
party
who
--
but
they
told
--
to
my
reading
they
told
just
the
opposite.
to
my
reading
of
the
legislative
history,
they
said
that
color
of
law
means
in
defiance
of
an
enactment
or
a
customary
practice
of
the
state,
means
in
defiance
--
not
in
defiance
of
it
but
in
obedience
to
it.
are
you
--
why
do
you
make
this
case
simpler
than
it
is
mr.
moore?
why
do
you
make
this
case
simpler
than
it
is?
how
can
anybody
with
all
respect
read
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
and
not
at
the
lowest
say
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
give
right
from
the
federal
court
where
a
person
acts
in
of
--
in
defiance
of
a
state
law.
there
is
an
overwhelming
body
of
legislative
history
to
that
--
to
that
conclusion.
why
do
you
make
this
thing
simpler
and
make
it
appear
that
all
we
have
to
do
is
just
read
the
statute
and
all
is
--
all
is
well.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
the
chief
justice
will
decide.
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
say
so,
you
haven't
set
it
forth
in
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
simply
stating
historic
facts
that
you
have
not
set
forth
the
history
which
showed
this
great
momentum
behind
this
legislation
that
there
were
to
be
no
right
except
when
there
is
the
im--
the
matter
of
state
action,
of
state
laws,
of
state
practice
behind
it.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
read
it
one
way
and
i
read
it
the
other
way.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
you
make
this
case
much
too
simple.
justice
felix
frankfurter
alright.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice
overlap)
it's
much
simpler
for
me.
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
don't
--
the
law
has
a
colloquial
name
and
the
fact
that
it's
called
a
ku
klux
klan,
the
ku
klux
statute
doesn't
mean
that
it
was
concerned
merely
with
mob
rule.
justice
felix
frankfurter
it
was
directed
against
the
black
codes.
that
was
the
stimulus
to
the
legislation.
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
--
i
didn't
say
it
was
restricted
to
that.
i
said
the
impulse
to
it
was
the
black
code
statutes
enacted
doing
all
sorts
of
things
and
it
was
deemed
that
it
will
act
under
those
then
you
can
bring
action
against
it
and
have
ultimately
this
court
hold
that
the
legislation
under
which
you
seek
shelter
is
unconstitutional.
justice
felix
frankfurter
why
shouldn't
you.
justice
felix
frankfurter
that's
a
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
is
it
counsel?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
justice
felix

i'm
sure
we
can
dispose
of
it
until
