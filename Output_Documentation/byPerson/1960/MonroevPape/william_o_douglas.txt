justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
williams
that
you're
referring
to
is
the
one
on
341.
justice
william
o.
douglas
90
--
97
and
we
there
did
apply
the
color
of
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
had
--
i
had
some
help
in
that
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
had
some
help.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
that'd
be
a
matter
of
proof,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
you
come
down,
you
could
--
you
think
williams
--
the
williams
case,
that
341
was
wrong,
wrongly
decided?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
--
your
--
your
line
of
thought
follows
the
line
of
thought
in
the
dissents
as
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
read
your
brief
because
nothing
that
they
could
do
to
extort
a
confession
could
be
done
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
illinois
therefore
it
could
not
be
in
--
within
the
color
of
law
of
illinois
because
any
illinois
court
would
have
--
have
rejected
the
confession
therefore
you
say
under
color
of
law
means
in
accordance
with
the
law.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
i
had
--
if
i
have
misunderstood,
you
would
hold
this
with
the
proper
cause
of
action,
properly
alleged
even
with
complaint
of
negroes
against
a
southern
municipality
or
southern
state
or
is
it?
isn't
that
what
you
meant
to
imply?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
you
were
going
to
say
that
the
color
of
law
meant
something
different
up
north
than
it's
there
in
the
south.
