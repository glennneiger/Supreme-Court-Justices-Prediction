justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
do
you
mean
by
they've
gone
after
these
cases?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
you
want
to
describe
the
--
that
the
color
of
state
law
to
mean
acting
legally?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
if
that
is
your
--
if
it
is
your
view,
(inaudible)
that
one
is
not
acting
under
color
of
state
law
unless
he
is
acting
within
the
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
--
then
how
do
you
explain
--
what
meaning
do
you
give
to
color
of
state
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
isn't
this
what
you're
really
saying,
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
that
a
state
or
its
provisions
may
not
be
held
liable
for
the
act
of
an
officer
unless
he
is
acting
within
the
course
and
scope
of
his
power.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
in
other
words,
to
make
for
liability,
he
must
be
acting
within
the
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
then
why
i
would
like
to
hear
you
saying,
would
congress
then
say
or
use
the
phrase
color
of
state
law
rather
than
in
obedience
to
state
law?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
perhaps
did
you
now?
i
--
i
just
want
to
understand
this,
your
--
your
argument,
i
guess.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
the
custom
was
the
same
thing,
it
--
i
assume
that
using
what
this
common
law
sense
that
has
so
long
existed,
it's
the
common
law
of
place.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
why
may
not
that
be
done
under
congress'
power
to
implement
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
so
that
is
not,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
that
the
state
merely
put
long
inquisition
to
act
under
color
of
this
law
because
he
must
act
to
the
act
in
obedience
to
this
law.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
now
may
ask
you
in
that
connection
(inaudible).
is
that
because
of
the
willfulness
or
because
of
the
governmental
immunity?
it's
irrespective
--
the
court
says
that
it's
irrespective
of
the
liability
of
the
police
officer.
in
other
words,
we
--
the
police
officers
re
--
presumed.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
that
he
realized
that
irrespective
of
his
liability
but
is
the
city's
immunity
borne
of
the
fact
that
the
police
officer's
conduct
was
willful
or
is
it
borne
of
sovereign
immunity?
the
city's
exemption
is
liable?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
--
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
karas
case.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
well,
that's
--
that's
right.
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
do
you
--
do
your
really
mean
that
--
you
really
mean
that
a
police
officer
in
chicago
acting
within
the
course
and
scope
of
his
authority
commits
a
wrong
that
the
city
of
chicago
is
liable?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
is
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
as
i
