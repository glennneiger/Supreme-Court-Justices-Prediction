mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
if
we
were
to
take
final
argument
of
counsel
at
its
face
value,
i
would
presume
that
i
have
already
confessed
error
in
this
particular
case
that
he
has
already
secured
a
judgment
against
pape
and
that
unfortunately
he
cannot
collect
the
judgment
and
that
is
all
there
is
to
this
case.
but,
i
don't
think
that
the
problem
is
quite
that
simple.
i
think
there
is
more
to
it
than
merely
a
confession
in
this
case.
the
civil
rights
act
has
been
on
the
books
since
1871
and
then
all
that
time
there
have
only
been
four
cases
before
this
court
involving
the
civil
rights
act,
true
enough,
there
have
been
other
statutes
but
there
have
only
been
four
cases
in
1871
involving
the
civil
rights
act.
and
in
none
of
those
cases
has
this
court
had
occasioned
to
test
or
to
examine
or
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
the
revised
statutes
of
187
--
of
1979.
the
last
time
that
this
case
was
before
this
court
was
in
1951,
that
involved
an
equity
proceedings
to
restrain
the
introduction
of
illegally
seized
evidence
in
the
state
criminal
action.
and
this
court
through
mr.
justice
frankfurter
discussed
the
wolf
case
that
counsel
has
discussed
today
and
said
that
all
legal
seized
evidence
although
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
not
admissible
or
rather
it
is
up
to
the
state
court
to
determine
whether
it
is
admissible.
i
think
that
it
is
necessary
at
this
time.
counsel
asked
in
his
petition
for
certiorari
that
you
grant
this
petition
to
test
the
constitutional
right
of
freedom
from
arbitrary
police
invasions
of
the
home.
let
us
examine
this
statute
and
let
us
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
constitutional.
let
us
determine
for
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
let
us
see
how
it
does
apply
to
this
particular
statute.
section
1
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
says,
"no
state
shall
make
any
law
nor
shall
any
state
deprive
any
person
of
life,
liberty
or
property."
way
back
in
the
olden
days,
way
back
in
1875,
this
court
in
a
case,
united
state
versus
cruikshank,
first
interpreted
in
language
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
at
that
time
this
court
determined
that
the
only
obligation
resting
upon
the
united
states
it
to
see
that
the
states
do
not
deny
the
right.
this
--
the
amendment
guarantees
but
no
more
the
power
of
the
national
government
is
limited
to
the
enforcement
of
this
guarantee.
and
then
we
have
the
civil
rights
case
in
which
of
the
same
language
was
expressed.
and
this
court
has
always
had
heard
--
adhered
--
adhered
to
the
general
principles
laid
down
in
these
two
cases.
mr.
justice
black
in
screws
versus
united
states
which
is
the
subject
which
is
so
much
discussed
in
this
case
said
the
fact
that
a
prisoner
is
assaulted,
injured
or
even
murdered
by
state
officials
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
is
deprived
of
any
right
protected
or
secured
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
fourteenth
amendment
did
not
alter
the
basic
relations
between
the
states
and
the
national
government.
our
national
government
is
one
of
delegated
powers
alone.
under
our
national
system
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
rest
with
the
states
except
as
congress
acting
within
the
scope
of
those
delegated
powers
have
created
offenses
against
the
unites
states.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
also
expressed
the
same
thought
and
that
united
states
versus
williams,
the
first
one,
341
united
states
70.
so
that
i
do
think
that
the
general
principles
as
to
the
delegation
of
power
by
the
national
government
and
to
congress
has
agreed
upon
by
every
member
of
this
court,
it
is
only
when
we
come
into
the
twilight
zone.
it
is
only
when
we
find
these
certain
principles
to
specific
facts
that
we
come
into
difficulty.so
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
this
civil
rights
act.
counsel
has
misquoted,
i'm
sorry
to
state,
the
language
of
the
civil
rights
act.
he
said
the
act
provides
that
there
is
a
violation
of
any
right.
that
is
not
true.
the
act
provides
that
if
there
is
any
deprivation
of
any
right
and
there
is
whole
of
a
difference
in
the
world
for
--
between
a
violation
and
a
deprivation.
and
also
there
is
a
whole
difference
in
the
world
between
old
section
20
of
the
criminal
code
and
the
present
civil
rights
act.
in
the
first
place,
the
old
criminal
code,
section
20
uses
the
word
willfully,
it
gives
a
specific
intent.
the
civil
rights
act
does
not
contain
the
word
willfully.
there
is
no
specific
intent.
the
old
criminal
code
provided
according
to
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
are
surprisingly
and
i
say
surprisingly,
our
present
civil
rights
act
does
not
tell
us
what
constitution
and
what
law
--
right
--
laws
must
be
violated.
it
does
not
say
of
the
united
states.
it
merely
says
the
constitution
and
the
laws.
what
constitution
and
what
laws
are
we
are
to
violate.
are
we
to
violate
the
laws
of
every
one
of
the
states?
is
that
what
constitution
had
in
mind
or
the
territory
as
it
says.
we
surely
cannot
imply
that
is
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
any
other
amendment
or
statutes
passed
by
the
congress.
as
--
this
question
was
discussed
in
great
detail
in
the
screws
case
here.
there,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
decided
that
this
section
20
containing
the
words
will
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no,
no.
pardon
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
--
mr.
justice
douglas
decided.
that
the
words
willfully
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
yes,
i
--
i
know
that.
and
it
was
a
very
difficult
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
were
stalemated
and
that's
--
in
a
particular
case,
four-to-four,
a
very,
very
interesting
case.
however,
in
that
particular
case
your
honor
discussed
the
question
of
willfully
and
determined
that
that
was
a
specific
definition
of
specific
intent
because
looked
--
hooked
up
with
that
was
the
phrase,
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
frankfurter
took
part
--
took
issue
with
the
question
of
willfully
and
stated
that
in
--
there
is
--
in
their
opinion
a
specific
intent
of
willfully,
take
it
in
and
of
itself
is
non-sufficient.
if
such
is
the
situation
in
the
screws
case
involving
the
criminal
section,
what
is
the
situation
in
this
case
where
two
of
the
linking
words
in
the
screws
case
is
missing
in
the
present,
mainly,
willfully,
and
the
fact
of
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
i
claimed
that
section
8
--
1979
is
unconstitutional.
first,
because
it
is
an
unlawful
deligation
of
rights
and
secondly
because
it
is
so
vague
and
indefinite,
it
is
unenforceable
because
of
these
two
provisions.
the
civil
rights
act
is
not
corrective.
it
is
not
prohibitive
legislation.
it
does
not
deal
with
state
action
but
rather
with
the
individual
action
unsupported
by
any
state
laws
or
rights.
it
is
primary
and
direct.
it
gives
one
individual
a
cause
of
action
against
another,
and
it
is
my
contention
that
congress
does
not
have
that
power
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
then
we
come
to
the
specific
question
of
whether
or
not,
the
acts
of
frank
pape
were
under
the
color
of
any
statute
or
ordinance.
it
is
admittedly,
the
constitution
and
statutes
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago
prohibit
unreasonable
search
and
seizures
and
assault
and
unreasonable
detention.
so
that
pape,
although
he
was
a
police
officer
of
the
city
of
chicago,
neither
acted
nor
purported
to
act
under
color
of
any
statute
or
ordinance.
rather,
he
acted
in
direct
violation
of
the
state
constitution
and
the
state
statutes
and
the
ordinances
of
the
city
of
chicago.
pape
who
was
merely
a
private
trespasser
and
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
violation
of
a
state
law
does
not
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
start
with
the
only
old
case
of
barney
versus
the
city
of
new
york,
a
193
u.s.
430
decided
in
1903
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
federal
courts
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
state
action.
and
then
we
have
this
snowden
versus
hughes
case,
an
illinois
case,
321
u.s.
1
decided
in
1943.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
state
canvassing
board
refused
to
certify
one
who
had
been
nominated
as
a
state
representative
and
he
filed
a
suit
under
the
civil
rights
act.
and
this
court
held
that
he
did
not
have
a
cause
of
action.
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
in
concurring
in
this
particular
opinion
stated,
the
question
whether
action
of
state
canvassing
board
is
state
action,
that
is
the
question.
it
is
not
to
be
resolved
by
abstract
considerations
such
as
the
fact
that
every
official
who
purports
to
ill
power
conferred
by
a
state
in
pro
tanto,
the
state
otherwise,
any
illegal
discrimination
of
a
policeman
on
the
beat
with
the
state
action
for
purposes
of
suit
in
a
federal
court,
hiding
that
language
is
very
(inaudible)
in
this
particular
case.
otherwise
every
illegal
discrimination
by
a
policeman
on
the
beat
would
be
state
action
for
purposes
of
suit
in
a
federal
court.
i
would
like
to
discuss
in
great
detail
screws
versus
united
states
which
apparently
is
the
basis
for
complaint
of
the
petitioners.
and
in
that
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
"we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
case
where
an
officer
not
authorized
to
act
nevertheless
takes
action.
here,
the
state
officers
were
authorized
to
act
--
to
make
an
arrest
and
to
take
such
steps
as
when
necessary
to
make
the
arrest
effective.
he
acted
without
authority
only
in
the
sense
that
they
used
excessive
force
in
making
the
arrest
effective."
that
is
not
the
situation
in
the
case
at
bar.
in
the
case
at
bar,
every
act
of
captain
pape
and
every
other
one
of
the
officials
was
the
illegal
furnishing
section.
they
did
not
have
a
search
warrant.
they
did
not
have
a
warrant
for
arrest.
they
arbitrarily
went
in
there
and
seized
these
people.
so
therefore,
the
screws
case
is
not
an
authority
for
the
facts
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
screws
case
was
a
criminal
case
under
a
criminal
act.
it
involved
the
united
states
government.
it
was
a
suit
between
the
united
states
and
a
criminal.
the
cause
of
action
in
the
case
at
bar
is
private
between
individuals.
in
the
screws
case,
they
acted
under
color
of
law.
it
had
a
warrant
for
his
legal
arrest.
they
did
not
act
under
color
of
law.
he
did
not
have
a
warrant.
his
conduct
did
not
come
within
the
statute.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
what?
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
he
does
not
have
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
--
the
power.
the
statutes
and
constitution
and
the
ordinance
specifically
provide
that
he
must
have
a
warrant
before
he
can
arrest
except
when
the
act
--
the
criminal
act
is
in
view
or
except
in
those
cases
where
a
crime
has
been
committed
and
he
has
reason
to
believe
that
this
individual
is
the
one
who
committed
the
crime.
those
are
the
only
instances
in
which
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
there
--
there
had
been,
yes.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
yes.
right.
he
was
put
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
well,
that
is
not
in
the
record.we
filed
--
we
filed
a
motion
to
strike
his
complaint.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right.
because
a
--
a
murder
had
been
committed,
the
wife
of
the
murdered
man
pointed
monroe
out
as
the
criminal
who
killed
his
wife
--
or
husband.
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
we
are
taking
the
record
as
we
find
it
and
we
contend
that
in
this
particular
case,
he
had
no
warrant
and
therefore,
it
was
not
justifiable.
also,
their
section
20
as
i
said
creates
an
offense
against
the
united
states.
the
civil
rights
act
creates
an
offense
by
one
individual
against
another
individual
and
his
action
was
not
an
offense
against
the
united
states.
the
united
states
is
not
a
party
in
this
particular
case
and
that
is
the
large
--
the
great
distinction
between
the
williams
case
and
the
screws
case
and
the
case
at
bar.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
what?
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
what
act?
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
in
my
opinion,
they're
not.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
under
the
civil
rights
act?
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
in
my
opinion,
he
is
not.
in
my
opinion,
he
--
he
is
not
acting
under
any
color
of
law.
he
is
not
acting
under
any
statute.
he
is
not
--
he
is
merely
a
tortfeasor.
he
is
in
no
different
position
than
every
stranger
around
the
street.
he
came
up
to
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
mean,
not
legally.
i
mean
that
--
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
had
in
mind
in
section
1979
which
is
a
civil
rights
act
should
be
construed
to
mean
that
the
only
time
an
individual
has
a
cause
of
action
is
when
the
police
officer
or
if
when
the
state
has
a
passed
an
act
contrary
to
the
constitution
and
when
the
state
has
passed
an
act
contrary
to
the
constitution
and
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
the
state
comes
into
play.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
color
of
state
law
is
custom
and
usage.
that's
where
custom
and
usage
comes
in.
in
my
opinion,
you
talk
of
violation
of
a
statute
or
color
of
law.
that
is
custom
and
usage
where
although
there
is
no
written
law,
certain
things
take
place
within
the
state.
we
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
civil
rights
act
was
enacted
shortly
after
in
the
freedom
of
the
displaced.
and
that
all
these
legislations
that
we
are
talking
about,
is
in
order
to
protect
the
free
slave
as
a
united
state
citizen.
and
it
seems
to
me
from
the
cases
are
that
it
was
directed
primarily
to
the
southern
states.
it
is
only
in
the
last
few
years
that
the
lawyers
in
chicago
and
other
northern
cities
had
begun
to
spread
the
theory
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
incidence
occurring
in
the
north
and
where
color
is
not
a
question.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
basic
theory
under
which
this
original
civil
rights
act
was
passed.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
cannot
--
i
cannot
hear
you
mr.
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
do
not
--
that
is
what
--
no,
that
was
the
purpose
of
this
enactment
and
--
but
the
civil
rights
act
is
directed
for
the
fourteenth
--
let's
put
it
this
way,
i
think
the
civil
rights
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it's
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
goes
only
to
action
by
the
state.
the
civil
rights
act
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
yes.
let
us
presume
for
the
sake
of
argument
at
the
state
of
illinois
passed
the
statute
legalizing
searches
and
seizures
where
the
--
even
though
they
are
unreasonable,
then
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fourteenth
amendment
according
to
the
early
cases
is
merely
prohibitive.
the
state
must
act
first
and
if
the
state
acts
in
contravention
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
the
act,
the
state
act
is
unconstitutional
and
can
be
corrected
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right,
as
--
as
long
as
that
supplements
the
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
--
i
thought,
mr.
justice
whittaker
that
i
had
explained
it.
if
not,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
in
the
north,
there
was
not
such
a
thing
as
custom
or
usage.
as
we
understand
it
pertaining
to
violations
of
personal
rights.
in
the
olden
days
shortly
after
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no,
i
presume
you're
right
there.
but
let
us
presume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
that
is
true.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i'm
sorry.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i'm
sorry.
now
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
the
majority
opinion,
yes.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
--
i
must
say
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
also
in
the
course
of
a
custom.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that's
right.
but
also
there
is
this
distinction,
mr.
justice
douglas,
in
regard
to
the
screws
case,
the
screws
case
was
a
criminal
case.
the
united
states
was
a
party.
the
civil
rights
act
gives
the
cause
of
action
for
--
to
one
individual
against
another.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
because
the
fourteenth
amendment
states
that
no
state
shall
--
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
prohibitive.
now,
when
you
say
the
fourteenth
amendment
says
no
state,
no
state,
no
state,
it
is
--
it
is
a
prohibitive
provision
and
as
this
court
has
so
often
said,
the
--
the
courts
may
--
must
wait
until
the
state
has
acted
illegally
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
before
it
connect
but
when
it
does
then
the
federal
government
can
act
and
not
before
that.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
that
is
right.
that
is
--
that
is
my
contention.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no.
we
--
i
never
thought
of
it
just
that
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
of
course,
the
city
is
a
subdivision
and
a
creation
of
the
state.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no
sir.
counsel
argues
the
wolf
case
and
says
that
the
wolf
case
along
with
the
elkins
case
was
controlling
in
this
particular
case.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
so.
i
think
that
he's
only
half
quoted
the
wolf
case.
true,
that
wolf
said,
the
wolf
case
said
that
unlawful
--
unreasonable
search
and
seizures
come
within
the
purview
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
that
there
he
stops,
he
--
he
proceeds
no
further.
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
being
so
still
it
is
within
the
power
of
the
state
whether
or
not
this
illegally
seized
evidence
will
be
admitted
in
evidence.
so
therefore
in
my
opinion,
neither
the
wolf
case
nor
the
elkins
case
have
any
weight
in
the
situation
that
we
are
now
discussing.
i
would
also
like
to
discuss
the
question
of
the
city
of
chicago
liability.
i
would
like
to
call
your
honors'
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
illinois,
we
have
a
statute
section
1-15
of
the
illinois
revised
cities
and
villages
act
which
defines
the
liability
of
the
city
of
chicago
as
far
as
the
initial
--
as
far
as
liability
for
wrongful
acts
or
for
negligent
act,
not
awful,
from
negligent
acts
that
the
police
officer
during
the
scope
of
his
employment.
and
in
the
case
of
gaca
versus
the
city
of
chicago,
in
411
ill.141,
the
illinois
supreme
court
held
that
statute
constitutional
and
therefore
it
declared
the
public
policy
of
the
state
of
illinois
in
regard
to
the
liability
of
the
city
of
chicago
insofar
as
his
police
officers.
and
it's
a
case
of
indemnity
and
it's
a
case
of
indemnity
only
where
there
is
negligence
and
there
is
no
liability
on
behalf
of
the
city
where
the
action
of
the
officer
maybe
lawful.
and
then
to
--
after
they
got
the
case,
there
was
a
case
of
karas
versus
snell,
11
ill.2d
233
which
is
further
construed,
section
1-15.
and
there,
a
police
officer
who
is
off
duty
and
drinking
in
a
bar,
attempted
to
arrest
someone.
he
pulled
his
gun,
shot
him
and
blinded
him
for
life.
karas
filed
a
suit
against
snell
and
the
city
of
chicago.
on
motion,
the
city
of
chicago
was
dismissed.
and
by
the
way,
originally
the
acquisitions
of
--
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
was
lawful
conduct
on
behalf
of
snell.
when
the
city
was
dismissed
from
the
action,
they
amended
their
complaint
to
one
of
simple
negligence,
and
by
agreement,
a
judgment
was
entered
in
favor
of
karas
against
snell
for
$169,000.
at
which
time,
karas
then
sued
the
city
of
chicago
under
section
1-15
of
the
indemnity
clause
and
we
contended
in
a
motion
to
strike
that
complaint
that
we
were
not
liable
unless
the
policeman
was
on
duty
and
he
was
not
negligent.
the
trial
court
denied
our
motion
and
judgment
was
entered
for
over
$200,000
including
interest.
the
illinois
supreme
court
reversed
that
judgment
and
said
that
section
1-15
is
a
statute
of
indemnity.
it's
not
one
of
first
liability
upon
the
city
of
chicago
and
that
therefore,
the
city
of
chicago
had
the
right
to
go
to
trial
and
to
prove,
number
one,
that
snell
was
not
a
police
officer
and
--
i
mean,
that
snell
was
not
on
duty
at
the
time
he
committed
the
acts
and
further
that
the
acts
were
done
willfully.
so
that
in
illinois
today,
the
city
of
chicago
is
not
liable
for
the
willful
conduct
of
a
police
officer.
and
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
in
this
particular
case
are
one
of
willfulness.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
you
mean
in
the
karas
case
or
in
the
case
at
bar?
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
am
talking
about
the
karas
case.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
in
the
karas
case,
in
my
opinion,
the
liability
of
the
city
created
by
statute
is
not
based
upon
governmental
immunity.
it
is
based
upon
a
direct
relationship
between
the
police
officer
and
the
city.
that
is
the
reason
that
the
state
of
illinois
held
the
act
constitutional.
they
said
that
it
was
in
fact
additional
compensation
to
the
police
officer.
so
that
under
the
karas
case
today
in
illinois
even
though
a
governmental
immunity,
the
city
of
chicago
cannot
be
liable
for
the
negligent
acts
of
a
police
officer
unless
the
police
officer
has
been
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority
and
unless
the
police
officer
was
negligent
in
performing
his
duties.
in
summary
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
not
today.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
it
is
not
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
it
--
it
only
is
liable
by
way
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
liable
under
the
common
law
today.
now
the
(inaudible)
case
is
one
that
the
counsel
discusses
but
we
do
not
accept
that
(inaudible)
case
and
then
further
it
only
abided
or
directed
or
respectively
in
the
future
and
not
in
the
past.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
impress
upon
your
honor
that
this
is
a
good
time
to
review
the
constitutionality
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
to
whether
it
is
vague
and
unworkable,
because
it
is
lacking
the
words
willfulness
and
with
--
does
not
tell
us
what
constitution
and
what
laws
are
being
violated
such
as
in
section
20.
and
then
two,
i
would
like
to
have
your
honors
determine,
first,
if
you
determine
the
way
i
hope
you
will
determine
the
issue
and
decide
that
color
of
law
and
statute
as
set
forth
in
the
civil
rights
act,
applies
to
violation
of
the
state
action
and
state
statutes
only
be
in
light
of
section
14th
--
amendment
fourteenth
and
therefore,
there
is
no
cause
of
action
declared.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no
sir.
mr.
justice,
(inaudible)
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
i
was
trying
to
explain
the
purpose
of
the
passage
of
the
civil
rights
act.
i've
tried
to
point
out
that
the
civil
rights
act,
the
first
original
civil
rights
act,
the
enforcement
act
and
the
present
civil
rights
act
enacted
in
1871.
it
was
enacted
shortly
after
the
prohibition
of
slavery.
and
that
the
cases
tell
us
that
the
purpose
and
the
intent
of
those
acts
were
to
guarantee
to
the
southern
negro
the
right
do
the
same
as
a
white
citizen
be
in
the
south.
and
then
i
went
on
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
the
original
enactment
of
these
statutes
did
not
apply
to
the
northern
states
because
in
the
northern
states,
we
do
not
have
many
of
the
custom
and
usages
that
were
prevalent
in
the
southern
states
immediately
after
slavery.
today,
i
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
what?
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
no
sir.
but
the
purpose
--
what
i'm
driving
at
is
the
purpose
of
the
act.
what
was
the
purpose
of
it?
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
i
read
the
cases,
the
purpose
was
to
give
equal
citizenship,
to
all
citizens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
sydney
r.
drebin
yes,
it
would've.
yes
it
would.
in
my
--
in
my
opinion,
there
would
be
a
state
statute,
a
direct
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
--
in
my
opinion,
it
will
be
not
--
be
necessary
for
this
court
to
come
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
city
of
chicago
is
liable
if
they
decide
that
the
trial
--
the
trial
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
properly
dismissed
the
complaint.
thank
you.
