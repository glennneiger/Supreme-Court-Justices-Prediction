suppose
he
had
not
found

but
it
found
that
he
was
engaged
in
both
businesses,
would
that
make
any
difference
in
your
reference?

mr.

referred
to
some
evidence
on

in
the
record.
justice
hugo

in
which
he
said
that
was
the
result.
that
was
a
statement
obtained
to
the
grand
jury
and
the
cause
of
the
wiretapping.
is
that
what
you're
talking
about
now
in
saying
that's
not
correct?
justice

on

costello
was
questioned
by
the

before

(voice

now,
i
understood
mr.
williams
to
say,
and
i
gather
that
this
was
--
difference
between
you
as
to
the
facts.
i
understood
him
to
say
that
the
record
shows
that
this
was
obtained
or
derived
from
the
knowledge
which
has
been
acquired
by
wiretapping.
justice
hugo

i
thought
--
justice
hugo

--
i
may
misunderstood
him
but
i
wrote
it
down
at
the
time
(voice

--
justice
hugo
l.

well,
that's
quite
a
different
question.
justice
hugo
l.

i
have
not
understood
that
to
be
the
argument.

it.

do
you
think
that
the
latter
provision
of
that
does
not
qualify
in
any
way?
i
was
just
looking
at
it
for
the
first
time
when
it
says
under
the
provision
of
section
702
of
the
nationality
act
of
1940
of
amendment.

to
which
you
just
referred
to,
right
after
the
quote,
you
say
the
court
should
not
adopt
or
follow
the
limitation
which
congress
had
deliberately
rejected,
has
it
ever
deliberately
rejected
it?
i
believe
that's
what
justice
brennan
wants.
