mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
born
in
1891
in
cosenza,
italy.
he
came
to
the
united
states
at
the
age
of
four
in
1895.
he
filed
a
declaration
of
the
intention
to
apply
for
citizenship
in
march
of
1923
and
filed
a
preliminary
form
of
application
in
may
of
1925,
an
application
for
citizenship
in
september
of
1925
and
was
granted
citizenship
at
that
time.
suit
was
instituted
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
of
1952
in
may
of
1958.
there
were
a
number
of
grounds
alleged
for
the
revocation,
cancellation
of
citizenship
but
the
one
that
is
germane
on
this
petition
is
that
the
petitioner
is
alleged
to
have
willfully
misrepresented
his
occupation
in
his
preliminary
form
of
application
and
in
his
application
for
citizenship
in
that
he
stated
that
his
occupation
was
real
estate
when
in
fact
the
government
contends
he
was
a
bootlegger.
now,
the
trial
judge
entered
an
order
revoking
citizenship
on
two
grounds.
he
rejected
all
of
the
other
grounds
averred
by
the
government.
the
two
grounds
were
that
there
was
a
willful
misrepresentation
of
occupation.
and
secondly,
a
willful
misrepresentation
when
petitioner
swore
that
he
would
support
and
defend
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
on
the
theory
that
he
didn't
love
the
constitution
that
he
didn't
love
all
of
it
and
the
eighteenth
amendment
was
a
part
of
it
and
that
there
was
certainly
a
mental
reservation
with
respect
to
that
part
of
it
when
he
swore
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
that
contention,
mr.
justice
stewart,
was
rejected
by
the
circuit
court
on
the
ground
that
the
swearing
to
support
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
really
is
a
foreswearing
of
allegiance
to
the
fatherland
and
a
swearing
of
allegiance
to
the
ideological
concept
of
the
democratic
system
and
that
it
does
not
require
embracing
all
the
individual
parts
of
the
constitution.
there
was
no
allegation
that
he
misrepresented
the
fact
when
he
said
he
was
attached
to
the
principles
of
the
constitution
and
so
that
second
ground
was
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals
leaving
only
one
ground
as
the
predicate
for
denaturalization
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court
in
its
present
posture.
now,
it's
our
contention,
if
the
court
please,
that
there
is
not
evidence
to
support
the
finding
that
there
was
a
willful
misrepresentation
of
the
fact
with
respect
to
this
petitioner's
occupation
at
the
time
the
representation
was
made
in
1925.
the
evidence
in
the
trial
court
shows
through
an
immigration
and
naturalization
inspector
who
was
offered
by
the
government
as
a
witness.
that
on
october
31,
1924,
a
corporation
was
formed
called
the
koslo
realty
corporation.
the
petitioner
was
the
president
of
this
corporation.
a
charter
was
issued
by
the
state
of
new
york
authorizing
this
company
to
buy,
sell,
manage
and
lease
real
estate
in
new
york
and
all
of
the
united
states
and
abroad
and
to
build
(inaudible)
houses
and
other
buildings
in
the
same
territorial
area.
the
record
shows
that
the
president
--
the
president
of
this
corporation
was
the
petitioner
and
that
his
associate
who
was
the
secretary
of
the
corporation
was
one
(inaudible)
the
record
further
shows
that
prior
to
his
preliminary
application
for
naturalization,
this
company
purchased
two
apartment
buildings
at
west
end
avenue
and
92nd
street
in
new
year.
the
record
shows
that
these
were
substantial
purchases
because
there
was
a
purchase-money
mortgage
issued
on
the
transaction
which
was
of
record
and
brought
to
court
by
the
witness
for
the
government
in
the
amount
of
$76,800.
and
on
june
22,
1925,
prior
to
the
petitioner's
naturalization,
these
apartments
were
in
fact
sold
bearing
mortgages
of
$116,000.
the
record
further
shows
that
the
petitioner
on
this
individual
transaction
made
a
profit
for
himself
of
$25,000
in
the
year
1925
which
is
the
crucial
year
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
he's
alleged
to
have
made
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he's
alleged
to
have
made
it,
mr.
justice
stewart,
on
may
1,
1925
when
he
filed
his
preliminary
form
and
then
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
--
the
incorporation
of
the
company
was
on
december
24
and
the
--
1924
and
the
purchase
of
the
west
end
properties
was
on
december
1,
1924.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
and
the
sale
was
on
june
22,
1925
which
would
have
been
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
subsequent
to
the
first
misrepresentation
alleged
by
the
government.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
second
was
on
september
10,
1925
when
he
filled
out
his
--
his
petition
for
naturalization
and
it's
contended
that
at
that
time,
he
was
orally
examined
also
and
said
he
was
in
real
estate
and
this
was
before
his
naturalization
proceeding
on
the
same
day,
september
10,
1925,
so
that
you
have
the
corporation
formed
october
31,
1924.
you
have
the
acquisition
of
two
apartment
houses
in
december
24
and
you
have
the
sale
of
those
apartment
houses
in
june
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
of
1925.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
you
have,
thereafter,
a
release
of
the
purchase-money
mortgage
by
the
petitioner
as
president
of
the
--
this
company
on
december
21,
1925.
now,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
examiner
said
that
these
records
were
unearthed
by
examining
the
real
estate
records
for
four
boroughs
of
new
york,
queens,
manhattan,
bronx
and
richmond.
brooklyn.
thank
you.
there
were
only
four
boroughs
wherein
an
investigation
was
made,
although
the
corporation
charter
specifically
gave
authorization
to
do
business
throughout
new
york
state
and
elsewhere.
over
and
above
this,
the
record
shows
that
lots
were
purchased
by
this
corporation
in
august
of
1925
--
on
august
12,
1925
in
the
bronx.
they
were
sold
the
next
year
to
the
rosenblum
realty
corporation
on
june
22
of
1926.
the
record
also
shows
a
very
substantial
real
estate
transaction
entered
into
by
this
corporation
of
which
the
petitioner
was
president.
in
october
of
1925,
when
several
pieces
of
ground
at
nelson
avenue
in
the
bronx
were
acquired,
there
was
a
purchase-money
mortgage
of
$70,000
on
this
property.
and
within
six
months,
this
property
was
sold
with
a
purchase-money
mortgage
of
$310,000
on
it
with
buildings
having
been
erected
on
it
and
the
sale
was
consummated
subject
to
leasings
and
tenancies
then
in
existence
demonstrating
that
substantial
buildings
had
been
put
up
in
1925,
sold
in
1926
with
leasings
and
tenancies,
carrying
a
mortgage
money
of
$300,000
by
the
corporation
of
which
this
man
was
the
president.
the
record
further
shows
that
there
were
two
other
corporations,
the
babylon
waterfront
company
and
white
homes
incorporated
both
of
which
charters
were
issued
for
real
estate
operations,
one
in
january
26,
and
the
other
in
july
of
1926.
i
think
it's
one
of
the
verities
of
life
that
one
does
not
become
active
of
record
in
the
real
estate
business
until
a
certain
passage
of
time
takes
place.
there
is
a
record
here
that
that
from
the
four
boroughs
which
were
examined
for
the
years
in
question,
these
transactions
took
place
at
this
time
and
that
there
was
a
profit
made
by
the
petitioner
of
$25,000.
now,
the
record
also
shows
that
during
the
13
years
between
1919
and
1932,
the
petitioner
had
income
of
$305,000.
that's
significant
for
these
reasons.
the
income
is
specifically
delineated
in
the
record
for
the
years
1927,
1929
and
1930,
namely
that
he
had
income
in
those
three
years
of
$134,000
leaving
$171,000
of
income
to
be
distributed
over
the
remaining
10
years,
which
would
give
a
mean
average
of
about
$17,000.
now,
i
say
vis-Ã -vis
the
profit
that
was
made
in
the
real
estate
transaction
of
1925
on
the
sale
of
the
apartments
at
west
end
avenue
and
92nd
street,
it
can
be
seen
that
the
$25,000
income
constituted
not
merely
a
substantial
part
of
the
income
for
that
year
derived
at
from
a
mean
average
but
the
major
part
of
petitioner's
income
for
that
year.
now,
this
$305,000
figure
was
a
figure
arrived
at
with
the
bureau
of
internal
revenue
in
a
settlement
of
tax
liability
for
the
13
years
in
question.
now,
if
the
court
please,
if
this
case
were
here,
not
as
a
denaturalization
case
but
as
a
perjury
case,
i
think
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
qualitatively,
the
evidence
here
would
not
support
a
perjury
conviction.
and
i
think
the
only
difference
between
a
perjury
case
on
this
answer
and
a
denaturalization
case
is
in
the
quantum
of
proof
and
the
procedural
requisites
of
proving
perjury
under
the
federal
statute.
but
qualitatively,
i
don't
think
that
the
evidence
supports
the
fact
that
this
was
a
perjurious
answer
or
a
willfully
false
answer
because
in
fact
at
the
time
that
the
representation
was
made
by
the
petitioner,
that
he
was
in
the
real
estate
business,
the
record
shows
as
adduced
by
the
government
itself
in
this
case
in
truth,
in
fact
he
was
in
the
real
estate
business.
now,
of
course,
the
quantum
of
proof,
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
is
that
evidence
must
be
clear
and
convincing
and
unequivocal
as
stated
in
the
baumgartner
and
the
schneiderman
case.
now,
the
court
has
said
in
the
nowak
and
maisenberg
cases
in
1958,
that
where
the
question
is
subject
to
an
inference
by
the
person
interrogated
and
that
the
inference
is
reasonable
and
that
he
answers
it
truthfully
on
the
inferential
predicate
that
a
denaturalization
decree
will
not
stand.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
two-pronged
question,
"do
you
believe
in
anarchy?
do
you
belong
to
any
organization
or
association
which
advocates
anarchy
or
the
overthrow
of
the
united
states
government?"
in
those
cases,
the
petitioner
has
answered
in
the
negative.
in
each
instance,
they
were
members
of
the
communist
party
at
the
time
that
they
made
these
answers.
and
this
court
said
that
those
questions
under
the
doctrine
of
the
houston
(inaudible)
might
conceivably
have
been
interpreted
by
the
person
answering
as
calling
for
an
answer
dealing
with
belief
in
anarchy
or
the
belonging
to
an
organization
advocating
anarchy
and
that
alone
and
therefore,
in
that
frame,
his
answers
could
not
be
said
to
constitute
a
willful
misrepresentation.
now,
in
this
case,
if
the
court
please,
the
government
conceded
below
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
question
propounded
was
subject
to
the
inference
that
it
was
calling
for
the
petitioner's
legitimate
occupation.
in
the
government's
position
as
enunciated
in
its
printed
brief
below,
it
said,
"surely,
this
question
could
have
been
construed
as
calling
for
the
petitioner's
legitimate
occupation."
he
could
have
interpreted
the
question
as
calling
for
only
legitimate
occupations.
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
below,
the
court
said
the
very
same
thing.
at
page
250
of
the
record
where
the
opinion
appeal
--
appears,
"surely,
it's
conceivable
that
an
applicant
might
believe
that
the
answer
call
for
no
more
than
a
disclosure
of
some
legal
occupation."
and
if
that
concession
is
made
and
if
that
concession
is
found
to
be
the
fact
by
the
lower
court
and
if
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
engaged
in
an
occupation
as
a
real
estate
operator,
then
i
say,
that
it
must
follow
inevitably
that
the
decree
of
the
lower
court
must
fail.
now,
how
could
this
information
concerning
alleged
criminal
activity
have
been
elicited
from
the
petitioner?
i
say
it
could
have
been
elicited
in
exactly
the
way
that
it's
now
elicited
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
authorities.
in
the
case
of
united
states
of
america
against
tooma
which
was
decided
only
in
october
of
this
year
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan.
there
is
spelled
out
an
exact
quote
from
the
application
for
naturalization
as
it
exist
today.
and
this
is
the
way
the
information
is
elicited
today
which
the
government
says
should
have
been
elicited
by
virtue
of
the
simple
question,
occupation,
my
present
occupation
is.
it
says,
"the
law
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
regarded
as
a
person
of
good
moral
character
who,
during
the
period
of
residence
required
for
naturalization
is
or
was
a
habitual
drunkard,
has
committed
adultery,
derived
income
principally
from
illegal
gambling
activities,
has
given
false
testimony
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
any
benefits
under
the
immigration
and
naturalization
laws,
is
or
was
a
polygamist
who
practiced
or
advocated
polygamy,
is
or
was
a
prostitute
or
engaged
in
or
received
support
of
the
proceeds
from
prostitution
or
procured,
imported,
or
attempted
to
procure
or
import
persons
for
prostitution
or
any
other
immoral
purposes,
or
who
came
to
the
united
states
to
engage
in
any
other
unlawful
commercialized
vice,
who
has
committed
a
crime
involving
moral
turpitude
or
is
or
has
been
an
illicit
trafficker
in
narcotics.
have
you,
at
any
time,
either
within
or
outside
the
united
states
ever
been
or
ever
committed
any
of
these
things
or
acts?
now,
if
that
question
had
been
asked
to
the
petitioner
and
if
the
evidence
had
showed
that
he
was
in
fact,
in
1925
or
at
any
time
theretofore,
engaged
in
bootlegging
and
he'd
answer
to
the
negative,
there
would
have
been
no
question
that
this
would
have
been
a
willfully
false,
materially
false
representation
on
which
a
denaturalization
decree
certainly
might
well
have
been
predicated.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
mr.
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
only
question
on
that
score
was,
"have
you
ever
been
arrested?"
now,
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
question
was
ever
asked
of
this
petitioner
and
the
government
failed
in
its
proof
below
on
that.
ordinarily,
that
information
would
appear
on
what
is
government's
exhibit
8
which
appears
in
the
back
of
the
record.
this
is
called
an
admitted
slip.
and
generally
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
in
those
days
--
that's
at
page
202,
mr.
justice
brennan.
generally,
in
admitted
slips
of
those
days,
there
would
appear
on
the
back
of
the
slip,
the
words
ncr
which
would
stand
for
no
criminal
record
or
if
a
criminal
record
were
divulged,
the
record
would
be
delineated
on
the
back
of
the
admitted
card.
but
here,
there
was
no
showing
that
such
question
was
ever
asked
of
the
petitioner
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
government's
proof
did
not
measure
up
on
this
score.
so
that
--
or
the
--
the
questions
that
were
put
can
be
found
in
the
record,
first
of
all,
at
page
200,
question
two,
"my
present
occupation
is
real
estate."
and
then,
the
government
contends
that
at
page
202,
the
typed
in
words
"real
estate"
were
an
oral
answer
given
by
petitioner
to
an
immigration
and
naturalization
examiner.
and
then
in
the
actual
petition
for
naturalization
which
appears
at
page
204,
government's
exhibit
9,
which
was
executed
on
september
10,
1925,
the
second
answer,
"my
occupation
is
real
estate."
so
for
these
reasons,
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
the
government's
case
did
not
establish
that
there
had
been
a
willful
misrepresentation
of
fact
by
petitioner
in
this
instance.
now,
secondly,
the
trial
judge
specifically
refused
to
draw
an
inference
from
the
fact
that
petitioner
did
not
testify
in
this
proceeding.
and
the
petitioner
did
not
testify
in
this
proceeding.
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
opinion,
at
page
208
of
the
record,
has
this
to
say,
"we
think
the
district
court,
though
it
did
not
do
so,
might
properly
have
buttressed
its
findings
by
the
unfavorable
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
costello
chose
to
remain
off
this
witness
stand
and
to
introduce
no
evidence
in
answers
--
in
answer
to
the
government
on
this
case
indicating
fraud."
the
matters
inquired
into
were
within
costello's
peculiar
knowledge.
since
costello
was
not
a
criminal
defendant
in
the
present
proceedings,
he
had
no
privilege
to
remain
silent,
citing
the
matles
case
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
(inaudible)
case
here.
then,
if
the
court
please,
the
circuit
court
went
on
to
do
precisely
what
the
trial
court
had
not
done
because
in
the
record,
at
page
250,
at
the
bottom
of
the
third
paragraph
on
that
page,
the
court
says,
"if
there
was
any
further
evidence
along
this
line,"
meaning
evidence
of
real
estate
operations,
"it
would
be
peculiarly
within
the
knowledge
of
costello
and
his
failure
to
produce
evidence
of
such
activity
warrants
the
inference
that
there
was
none
such."
now,
that
alone,
i
would
not
contend,
was
sufficient
to
say
that
the
appellate
court
drew
an
inference
against
him
from
his
failure
to
take
the
stand.
but
that
in
context
with
the
final
sentence
on
this
page,
"surely,"
said
the
circuit
court,
"it
is
conceivable
that
an
applicant
might
believe
that
the
answer
called
for
no
more
than
a
disclosure
of
some
legal
occupation."
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
costello
so
believed.
in
other
words,
a
hiatus
in
the
proof
is
supplied
by
silence.
and
i
say
that
the
government
is
spiked
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
with
respect
to
this
proposition
of
law
because
either
the
law
is
that
a
defendant
maybe
called
in
a
denaturalization
proceeding
to
give
evidence
against
himself
or
he
may
not.
either
citizenship
is
one
of
those
things
protected
within
the
purview
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
it
is
not.
if
it
is,
then
he
could
not
have
been
called
and
it
likewise
follows
that
no
inference
could
have
been
drawn
against
him
from
his
failure
to
testify.
if
it
is
not,
then
he
was
equally
available
to
the
government
and
they
could
have
called
him
and
asked
him
the
specific
question
as
to
what
he
believed
the
question
meant
when
it
was
propounded
to
him.
so
that
they
are
seeking
to
draw
an
inference
from
the
failure
to
produce
evidence
which
was
equally
available
to
the
government
as
it
was
to
the
defendant
if
a
defendant
is
properly
callable
and
if
he
is
not
properly
callable,
then
they
are
taking
his
privilege
within
the
fifth
amendment
and
turning
it
back
inferentially
against
him
to
avoid
the
true
purpose
of
it.
now,
this
court
has
never
passed
on
the
question,
the
specific
question
as
to
whether
a
defendant
may
be
called
by
the
government
in
an
effort
to
denaturalize.
that
wasn't
reached
in
the
minker
case.
the
matles
case
in
the
second
circuit
ruled
that
he
could
be
called
but
it
was
with
some
misgivings
that
judge
clark
penned
those
words
and
so
stated.
and
in
this
case,
in
the
first
instance,
the
trial
judge,
judge
palmieri
wrote
a
long
and
learned
decision
on
this
and
concluded
by
saying
that
all
of
his
instincts
and
all
of
his
thoughts
in
the
matter
led
him
to
believe
that
a
defendant
should
not
be
called
in
this
kind
of
proceeding
but
that
he
was
fearful
that
it
would
abort
the
government's
case
if
he
denied
them
the
right
to
call
petitioner
and
so,
he
allowed
them
to
call
him
and
--
so
that
the
matter
could
be
passed
upon
by
an
appellate
court.
so
i
say
that
here
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that
was
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
in
the
second
circuit
before
it
came
here
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
the
first
time
in
1957.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
so
that
in
this
instance,
the
circuit
court
engaged
in
drawing
inferences
which
the
trial
court
did
not.
it
drew
inferences
that
the
fact
finder
didn't
draw
and
undertook
to
buttress
its
conclusion
by
those
inferences
drawn
at
the
appellate
level.
and
i
say
that
those
inferences
could
not
properly
be
drawn
in
this
case
under
whatever
postulate
this
court
adopts
with
respect
to
the
law
of
denaturalization
on
the
right
of
the
government
to
call
a
defendant.
again
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
believe,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
in
a
case
where
the
government
has
the
burden
that
it
has
in
this
case,
which
is
very
close
to
the
burden
in
a
criminal
case,
that
the
appeals'
court
should
draw
inferences
from
the
evidence
that
the
trial
court
has
rejected
because
it
is
then
substituting
its
fact
finding
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
function
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it
did
that.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
judge
dawson
did
not
draw
an
inference
that
the
petitioner
in
this
instance
--
he
did
not
draw
an
inference
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
understanding
of
the
question
about
occupation.
the
circuit
court
drew
an
inference
that
petitioner
understood
the
question
to
call
for
all
occupations,
legal
or
illegal,
and
they
so
stated.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
we
don't
have
an
inference
being
drawn
from
viva
voce
testimony
of
the
petitioner
or
any
other
witnesses.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
there
was,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
oral
evidence
with
respect
to
this
issue
in
the
trial
court.
and
i
think
in
--
that
the
whole
question
of
inference
as
to
the
petitioner's
belief
must
be
drawn
in
context
with
that
oral
evidence.
true,
it
did
not
come
from
his
lips
but
there
was
oral
evidence
in
the
court
below
on
this
overall
issue,
which
i
think
required
that
such
inferences
has
to
be
drawn,
be
drawn
by
the
true
trier
of
the
facts.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
they
rejected
his
finding
that
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
he
found
--
he
may
rejected
finding
four,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
at
page
28.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
understood
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
understood
--
i
understand
them
to
reject
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
understand
them
to
be
rejecting
that
when
they
say
--
i'm
looking
for
the
page
if
you'll
just
(inaudible),
when
they
say
that
they
could
not
conclude
that
he
did
not
have
the
request
allegiance
to
the
united
states
or
that
he
falsified
his
allegiance
to
the
united
states.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
i
--
no.
i
understood
you
to
ask
me
as
to
the
finding
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
that
they
rejected
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
wasn't
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it
wasn't
that
they
rejected
the
finding.
it
was
that
they
made
a
finding
that
he
had
not
made
that
the
silence
of
the
defendant
was
inappropriate
basis
for
inferring
that
he
understood
the
question
as
the
government
contends
he
should've
understood
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
said
that
he
would
not
draw
an
inference
from
the
petitioner's
silence
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
--i
--
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
the
reach
of
your
suggestion
that
where
you
have
not,
the
usual
cases
of
the
district
court,
the
district
judge,
saw
the
witness,
heard
and
etcetera
and
made
that
kind
of
an
assessment,
whether
--
to
what
extent
the
court
of
appeals
has
limited
on
the
same
body
of
material
to
say,
"it
lends
itself
fairly
to
a
deduction
or
an
inference,
although
the
trial
court
was
neutral
about
it."
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
in
essence
our
position
is
that
the
trial
judge
said
he
would
not
draw
any
inference
from
the
petitioner's
silence.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"we
do
draw
an
inference
from
the
petitioner's
silence."
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
it's
a
--
i
think
it's
fair
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that's
what
he
meant.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
in
the
fairness
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
in
fairness
that
that's
exactly
what
the
trial
judge
had
in
mind,
that
he
felt
that
he
should
not
draw
an
inference
and
--
and
i
think
that
his
feeling
that
he
was
inhibited
from
drawing
an
inference
was
illegal
inhibition
and
not
a
factual
inhibition.
i
think
that
is
the
fact.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
generally
true,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
but
here,
you
have
the
unique
situation
where
regardless
of
what
the
law
is,
they
were,
i
believe,
erroneous
in
drawing
a
conclusion
from
his
failure
to
testify
because
if
the
law
is
that
he
could've
been
called
to
testify,
then
the
government
could've
called
him
and
a
hiatus
in
the
government's
proof
should
not
be
filled
by
an
inference
from
the
failure
to
call
evidence
which
was
equally
available
to
it.
and
if,
on
the
other
hand,
he
could
not
have
been
called
because
of
the
fifth
amendment
then
--
because
of
all
of
the
body
of
law
on
that
subject,
no
inference
should've
drawn
from
his
invocation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
--
i
don't
know
what
rationalizations
the
court
of
appeals
used
to
arrive
at
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below,
except
insofar
as
they're
articulated
in
the
opinion
and
they
do
engage
in
articulation
of
one
rationalization
which
i
believe
has
conferred
the
law.
and
it
may
be
that
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
says
is
entirely
correct
that
they
should
be
told
that
this
rationalization
was
improper
and
asked
whether
they
can
justify
the
trial
court's
finding
without
it.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
know.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
now,
if
the
court
please,
again,
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
these
proceedings
should
be
barred
by
reason
of
the
delay
in
their
institution
because
the
long
delay
constitutes
a
violation.
in
this
instance,
i
believe,
of
petitioner's
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment
because
it
is
our
contention
that
in
this
proceeding,
there
was
clearly
called
for
the
application
of
the
equitable
doctrine
of
laches,
for
these
reasons.
the
petitioner
was
naturalized
in
1925.
the
record
shows
that
in
that
same
year,
he
was
arrested
in
the
same
district
after
an
investigation
by
the
same
office,
united
states
attorney's
office,
which
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
naturalization
proceeding
for
violation
of
the
volstead
act.
he
was
indicted
for
violation
of
the
volstead
act.
the
next
year,
he
was
tried
for
violation
of
this
act
and
there
was
a
disagreement
among
the
jurors
and
ultimately
a
nolle
pros
entered.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
was
arrested
in
december.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
was
arrested
in
1925,
december.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
he
was
indicted
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
--
in
the
following
month
and
he
was
tried
in
a
disagreement
to
the
problem.
so
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
government
has
had
knowledge
of
the
fact
if
it'd
be
true
that
this
petitioner
was
engaged
in
violation
of
the
volstead
act
for
27
years
before
they
instituted
the
first
case
and
for
33
years
before
they
instituted
the
present
proceedings.
they've
had
this
information.
the
record
shows
in
the
first
case
that
there
were
three
united
states
attorneys
who
were
engaged
in
an
investigation
of
this
petitioner
in
1925
that
they
were
using
wiretap
methods
of
investigation
on
his
office
at
that
time.
the
record
shows
in
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
they
indicted
him
--
i
believe,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
was
january
of
1926.
he
was
arrested
in
december
of
1925
and
indicted
the
following
month.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
1925,
september.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
my
--
my
recollection
is
they
began
in
january
of
1926
and
culminated
in
an
indictment
in
1926,
january.
he
was
tried
in
1927
and
the
jury
disagreed
that
no
retrial
was
ever
held.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
court
points
out
so
far
as
the
early
wiretapping
is
concerned,
the
testimony
shows
that
in
the
period
prior
to
1925,
the
united
states
attorney
in
new
york
was
conducting
an
investigation
of
bootlegging
activities
of
a
number
of
persons
including
the
petitioner
in
this
instance.
and
that
in
the
course
of
this
investigation,
certain
telephones
were
tapped
and
it
goes
on
to
list
the
assistants
who
were
in
charged
of
this
investigation
and
subsequently
list
the
indictment
which
was
returned.
in
any
event,
in
1939,
there
was
a
federal
grand
jury
proceeding
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
conducted
by
the
then
united
states
attorney
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
this
petitioner
was
called
and
he
gave
testimony
to
the
fact
that
he
had
engaged
in
violation
of
the
liquor
laws
of
the
united
states
during
the
period
in
question.
so
that
--
that
there
has
been
information
within
the
canada
government
as
i
indicated
since
1926,
1925,
december,
we
can
go
back
that
far,
to
the
effect
that
this
petitioner
at
or
about
the
time
of
naturalization,
was
engaged
in
the
conduct
which
is
now
being
used
as
the
predicate
prescripting
him
of
his
citizenship.
in
--
in
the
decision
of
the
circuit
court
the
first
time,
it's
interesting
to
observe
that
in
defense
of
the
use
of
the
wiretap
evidence
that
was
made
in
1925,
the
circuit
court
observes
while
you
can't
complain
about
the
use
of
this
wiretap
evidence
because
it
was
spread
out
on
the
public
records
of
the
courts
of
new
york
and
therefore
available
to
the
immigration
authorities
and
the
republication
of
wiretap
information
certainly
isn't
an
offense.
in
other
words,
they
were
justifying
the
fact
that
the
immigration
authorities
used
wiretap
evidence
spread
on
the
records
of
new
york,
saying
it
was
public
information
and
they
could
have
got
it.
the
same
argument,
of
course,
holds
that
the
fact
that
the
man
was
engaged
in
the
activities
which
they
contented
he
was
engaged
in
27
years
later,
was
available
to
him
because
they
said
the
fruit
of
such
tapping
was
spread
on
the
public
record
of
the
open
trial
for
bootlegging.
we
do
not
construe
605
of
the
communications
act
to
render
it,
a
crime
to
republish
information
which
was
lawfully
intercepted
and
divulge
once
before
prior
to
the
act's
passage.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
yes.
now,
the
government
says
to
that,
mr.
justice
stewart,
"no,
we're
not
barred
by
laches
because
laches
doesn't
bar
the
government
in
anything."
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
defense
of
laches
here
because
the
government
has
the
benefit
of
the
rule
quod
nullum
tempus
occurrit
regi
that
--
and
this
is
a
rule
of
--
of
public
policy
that
was
made
applicable
in
this
country
by
mr.
justice
story
so
as
the
public
might
be
protected
from
the
negligence
and
faithlessness
of
their
servants.
and
so
it
says
that
the
government
could've
waited
27
years
or
30
years
and
brought
this
action.
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
all
of
the
cases
wherein
this
doctrine
has
been
applied
by
this
court
have
been
cases
involving
public
revenues
or
the
public
funds.
they've
been
cases
which
can
be
broken
down
categorically
into
three
classes.
they've
been
cases
of
suits
on
surety
bonds,
suits
for
title
to
public
lands
and
suits
for
monetary
claims
but
not
suits
involving
this
kind
of
right.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
that's
certainly
so,
mr.
justice
stewart,
and
i'm
hopeful
that
this
will
be
the
precedent
breaker.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
it's
interesting,
i
think,
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
that
at
the
time
that
justice
story
enunciated
this
doctrine
as
applicable
to
the
united
states
of
america
and
barred
it
from
the
common
law
of
england
that
there
was
a
three-year
statute
limitations
on
treason.
now,
the
only
justification
for
this
doctrine
is
a
public
policy.
now,
at
the
time
that
he
enunciated
this
doctrine
of
public
policy,
it
was
the
public
policy
of
this
nation
as
enunciated
in
his
congressional
statute
that
treason
prosecution
shouldn't
be
brought
three
years
after
the
fact.
i
say
that
the
public
policy
with
respect
to
citizenship
ought
to
be
the
other
way
because
otherwise,
we
are
leading
inevitably
to
a
duality
of
classification
for
citizenship.
because
if
the
government
can
lie
back
and
wait
27
years
to
institute
a
denaturalization
case
on
grounds
which
it
knew
about
27
years
before,
what
it
can
do
is
to
make
a
naturalized
citizen
subject
to
scrutiny
for
his
post-naturalization
conduct
unlike
a
natural
born
citizen
and
the
government
can
then
make
the
decision
on
its
own
as
to
what
is
some
unspecified,
unalleged,
unproven
misconduct
should
be
the
triggering
force
to
cause
a
denaturalization
suit
to
be
filed
three
decades
after
the
fact
for
something
that
they
knew
about
at
the
time
that
it
took
place.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
don't
know
that
i'll
ever
be
given
that
opportunity,
mr.
justice
frankfurter.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
well,
i
do
before
i
go
before
a
senate
committee,
your
honor.
now,
again,
whatever
effect
you
will
give
to
the
decision
of
the
court
below
in
the
first
case
when
it
entered
its
dismissal,
i
think
this
must
follow.
judge
palmieri
in
the
lower
court
found
that
all
the
source
material
for
the
affidavit
of
good
cause,
all
the
source
material
that
he
had
available
to
him
indicates
on
their
face
that
wiretaps
were
extensively
used
and
that
there
were
innumerable
wiretaps
and
that
these
wiretaps
clearly
vitiated
the
alleged
admissions
in
the
aforementioned
hearings
by
the
defendant
from
the
standpoint
of
their
use
as
evidence.
this
was
what
judge
palmieri
found
that
the
evidence
before
the
new
york
grand
jury
and
before
the
referee
assigned
by
the
appellate
division
of
the
new
york
supreme
court
was
evidence
that
was
infected
plainly
with
wiretaps.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
him
and
it
said
this.
it
said,
and
this
is
the
first
time
this
case
went
to
the
second
circuit,
it
said
the
moving
papers
included
extracts
from
the
defendant's
testimony
before
a
new
york
county
grand
jury
in
1943
before
a
referee
appointed
by
the
new
york
state
appellate
division,
first
department
in
1943
in
regard
to
disciplinarian
proceedings
against
thomas
aurelio
and
before
the
kefauver
committee
in
the
united
states
senate
which
held
hearings
in
1950
and
1951.
these
transcriptions
suggested
that
state
officers
had
indeed
tapped
the
defendant's
phone
in
1943.
as
a
result
of
which,
he
testified
before
the
three
bodies
to
facts
which
he
might
not
otherwise
have
revealed.
now,
after
this
finding
by
the
trial
judge
and
by
the
circuit
court
judge,
the
trial
judge
in
the
second
case
admitted
this
evidence
against
the
petitioner.
not
only
that
he
admit
the
evidence
against
the
petitioner
but
he
made
the
very
evidence
which
was
infected
with
wiretapping,
a
major
crutch
in
his
findings
of
fact
and
he
quotes
extensively
in
his
opinion
at
pages
24
and
25
from
this
very
evidence
to
show
admissions
made
by
the
defendant.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
record
shows
that
in
this
interrogation,
which
was
admitted
into
evidence
against
this
petitioner,
he
was
confronted
with
48
wiretapped
conversations.
the
--
the
interrogator
told
him
that
he
had
dozens
of
others,
to
use
his
exact
language,
and
that
he
had
130
conversations
between
petitioner
and
one
other
person,
not
relevant
to
this
case,
and
to
dozens
of
conversations
between
petitioner
and
one
(inaudible).
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
petitioner
was
confronted
with
a
tapped
telephone
conversation
during
this
interrogation
between
him
and
one
o'connell
who
happened
to
be
one
of
his
co-indictees
in
the
1925
bootlegging
case
and
on
the
same
page,
he's
asked
about
whether
he
ever
engaged
in
the
liquor
business
and
makes
an
admission
that
he
did.
now,
these
things
were
offered
against
him
in
the
trial
court
over
vigorous
objection
after
they
had
been
found
to
have
been
--
admissions
which
were
induced
by
wiretaps.
and
that
finding
had
been
confirmed
by
an
appellate
court
which
said
that
since
they
were
state
taps
that
it
was
not
improper
for
the
state
district
attorney
to
use
them
in
that
proceeding
or
for
them
to
be
received
in
the
federal
court
before
(inaudible).
when
this
matter
came
before
the
circuit
court
below,
it
did
not
elude
in
its
opinion
to
the
admission
of
this
evidence
but
it
is
here,
it
is
referred
to
in
the
circuit
court
as
a
basis
for
the
finding
that
petitioner
was
a
bootlegger.
it's
--
it's
referred
to,
if
the
court
please,
as
one
of
the
basis
upon
which
the
conclusion
was
drawn.
at
page
249
of
the
record,
reference
is
made
to
this
testimony
which
he
was
given
when
he
--
which
he
had
given
when
he
was
confronted
with
some
48
wiretaps
and
when
he
was
told
that
there
were
dozens
of
others.
of
course,
it's
urged
by
the
government
in
its
brief
that
at
no
time
was
he
confronted
with
a
wiretap
that
antedated
1930
but
at
no
time
was
he
told
by
his
interrogator
that
the
interrogator
did
not
have
in
his
possession,
wiretaps
that
antedated
1930.
and
the
fact
is
the
record
shows
that
there
were
wiretaps
on
his
premises
as
early
as
1925
and
1926.
so
for
these
reasons,
if
the
court
please,
because
number
one,
there
is
not
evidence
here
to
support
a
finding
of
willful
misrepresentation
with
respect
to
occupation
because
an
inference
was
engaged
in
by
the
appellate
court
contrary
either
to
the
rights
of
the
petitioner
under
the
fifth
amendment
or
contrary
to
the
basic
evidentially
rule
that
evidence
--
evidential
inferences
may
not
be
drawn
from
the
failure
to
produce
evidence
equally
available
to
the
other
side
and
because
the
government
has
waited
33
years
in
this
instance
to
bring
this
action
on
information
which
it
had
in
the
first
instance
and
because
i
believe
that
it
will
lead
to
a
duality
of
classification
of
citizenship,
if
this
rule
is
not
enforced,
the
application
of
laches
to
this
case
and
because
the
trial
court
received
wiretapped
evidence
which
had
been
excluded
before
and
which
had
been
found
before
to
have
induced
the
admissions
of
the
defendant.
for
these
reasons,
i
respectfully
urge
that
this
court
reverse
the
court
below
and
send
the
case
with
orders
for
dismissal
with
finality.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
if
the
court
please.
question
was
addressed
to
counsel
during
his
argument
as
to
the
volume
of
real
estate
transactions
that
were
engaged
in
by
the
petitioner
prior
to
his
signing
the
application
for
naturalization.
the
record
shows
that
the
realty
corporation
was
formed
in
october
1924.
and
the
record
also
shows
that
a
number
of
real
estate
transactions
were
engaged
in.
but
contrary
to
what
counsel
said
to
the
court
through
inadvertence,
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
there
was
a
very
major
transaction
engaged
in
prior
to
the
first
application,
the
preliminary
application
for
naturalization
because,
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
record
at
page
24,
you
will
see
that
the
westin
department
building
was
purchased
and
that
the
recollection
of
the
petitioner
as
expressed
in
one
hearing
was
that
it
was
purchased
for
$125,000
and
that
that
transaction
was
entered
into,
as
the
record
shows,
in
the
month
of
december
1924
and
that
the
apartment
was
sold
at
the
same
time
as
the
closing
on
the
purchase
was
entered
into
and
that
a
profit
was
realized
to
$25,000
by
the
petitioner
himself
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
had
a
partner
in
the
transaction.
so
that
there
was
a
substantial
real
estate
transaction
engaged
in
by
this
corporation
in
the
terms
of
reference
of
the
time
at
which
it
was
consummated
some
35
years
ago.
and
the
profit
was
realized
of
$25,000
prior
to
the
preliminary
application
made
on
may
1
and
this
was
a
major
portion
of
the
petitioner's
income
if
you'll
look
at
the
evidence
which
the
government
offer
itself
on
his
income
over
the
13
years
prior
to
1932.
also,
if
the
court
please,
the
record
shows
that
this
was
just
not
an
isolated
transaction,
that
it
was
followed
in
sequence
by
other
transactions,
one
of
which
was
many
times
greater
than
this
when
petitioner,
through
his
corporation,
purchased
some
properties
that
he
erected
some
major
apartment
buildings
within
a
few
months
after
his
naturalization.
now
--
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
no,
sir.
there
was
none.
there
was
no
question
like
that,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
might
say
to
you
that
contrary
to
the
record
on
his
real
estate
transactions
which
are
most
specific,
the
testimony
with
respect
to
the
bootleg
--
leg
transactions
do
not
specify
any
transactions
at
all
in
the
year
1925.
there
were
some
witnesses
who
testified
35
years
almost
after
the
facts
which
they
purported
to
relate.
their
recollections
as
you
will
see
from
a
first
reanalysis
of
the
testimony
was
deemed
in
vague
and
most
nebulous
and
attenuated
with
respect
to
any
of
these
transactions.
but
mr.
kessler
testified
only
with
respect
to
transactions
before
1923.
mr.
feldman
testified
only
to
transactions
before
mr.
kessler's
conviction
in
1923.
mr.
mccloud
testified
only
with
respect
to
one
harry
sausser.
mr.
kelly,
another
witness
testified
only
with
respect
to
a
transaction
about
whisky
aboard
a
ship
called
vinson
a.
white
(ph)
and
his
testimony
regarding
the
petitioner
was
that
he
may
have
overheard
this
conversation
which
he
had
with
one
spill
of
coffee.
the
testimony
of
helen
sausser,
the
daughter
of
the
deceased
harry
sausser,
is
most
vague
and
nebulous
with
respect
to
the
time
at
which
these
alleged
conversations
that
she
heard
between
her
deceased
father
and
the
petitioner
took
place.
they
were
--
she
was
dipping
back
some
35
years.
so
that
the
record
is
much
clearer
from
the
government's
own
proof
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
occupation
vis-Ã -vis
real
estate
transactions
which
is
a
matter
of
record
than
it
was
with
respect
to
any
bootleg
operations.
now,
on
this
question,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
that
the
government
would
interpolate
the
question
to
prefix
the
word
"principal"
or
--
or
they
would
add
an
s
and
expect
that
the
petitioner
should've
revealed
all
of
his
occupations
that
wasn't
asked.
there
was
no
question
directed
to
him
with
respect
to
whether
he
had
done
anything
which
smack
of
criminality
or
which
partook
of
immoral
conduct.
this
wasn't
designed
to
elicit
that
information
and
no
question
was
propounded
which
was.
on
the
question
of
the
wiretaps,
i
would
like
to
restate
my
position
because
i'm
not
sure
that
counsel
has
accurately
paraphrased
it
to
the
court.
my
position
on
that,
if
the
court
please,
is
that
the
lower
court
which
considered
these
wiretaps
found
in
excluding
them
and
holding
them
to
be
tainted
in
the
record
of
the
first
case
of
which
counsel
referred
at
page
103
found
this.
it
appears
to
me
that
the
use
of
these
transcripts
vitiated
the
alleged
admiss
--
admissions
in
the
aforementioned
hearings
by
the
defendant
from
the
standpoint
of
their
use
as
evidenced
in
this
court
because
all
of
that
testimony
must
be
deemed
to
comprise
parts
of
a
continuous
process
in
which
all
of
these
records
became
affected
by
this
illegality.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
fact
that
the
admissions
were
elicited
by
the
use
of
the
wiretap
records,
although
saying
that
the
wiretapped
records
could've
gone
in
because
they
were
state
wiretaps.
the
court
of
appeals
said
this,
"these
transcripts
suggested
that
state
officers
had
indeed
tapped
the
defendant's
phone
in
1943
as
a
result
of
which
he
testified
before
the
three
bodies
to
facts
which
he
might
not
otherwise
have
revealed."
and
the
record
here
shows
that
the
first
admission
that
he
made
with
respect
to
bootlegging
came
after
he
was
confronted
with
a
wiretap
of
a
conversation
between
him
and
one
o'connell
who
was
a
co-indictee
with
him
in
1925.
that
comes
at
page
102
of
the
record.
when
he's
confronted
with
that,
he
makes
his
first
admission.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
the
court
--
the
--
the
circuit
court
in
this
proceeding,
mr.
justice
brennan,
did
not
discuss
at
although
that
question
was
raised
very
vigorously
by
us
in
that
court.
but
they
do
not
discuss
this
question.
mr.
edward
bennett
williams
i
think
they
do
for
this
reason.
i
think
if
the
argument
which
i
made
early
today
with
respect
to
the
order
of
dismissal
by
judge
mcgohey
pursuant
to
the
mandate
of
this
court
has
--
has
any
effect,
if
--
if
we
reject
the
argument
that
i
make
on
res
judicata
and
this
court
says
that
he
did
not
reach
the
merits
and
that
this
did
not
reach
the
merits.
if
the
government
would
contend
that,
it
may
not
contend
it
certainly
that
it
does
not
have
a
binding
effect
with
respect
to
the
effect
of
these
wiretap
conversations
on
the
admissions
that
were
elicited
from
this
petitioner
because
both
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
unequivocally
found
that
these
were
the
things
which
produced
though
--
the
admissions
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
trial
court
in
its
findings
of
fact
and
by
the
appeals
court
in
affirming
those
findings.
