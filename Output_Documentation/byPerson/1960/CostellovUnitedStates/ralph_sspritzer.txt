mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
address
myself
in
order
to
the
contention
relating
to
the
adequacy
of
the
government's
proof.
secondly,
i
should
like
to
go
on
to
the
contention
that
a
portion
of
that
proof
was
tainted
because
of
wiretapping
which
had
taken
place.
and
i
should
like
to
reserve
for
final
consideration,
the
contentions
which
are
based
on
the
lapse
of
time.
now,
certainly,
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
government
has
a
burden,
a
heavy
burden
of
showing
by
convincing
evidence
that
the
misrepresentation
was
a
misinterpretation
to
begin
with
and
that
it
was
willfully
made.
and
i
think
that
burden
is
certainly,
particularly
heavy
when
the
facts
go
back
a
good
many
years.
now,
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
proof,
mr.
williams
has
challenged
the
adequacy
of
the
government's
evidence
but
perhaps
understandably
has
not
summarized
that
evidence
or
any
of
its
particulars.
now,
before
going
on
to
those
particulars,
i
would
like
to
make
brief
reference
to
what
the
courts
below
found.
at
pages
27
and
28,
your
honors
will
find
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
you
will
note
that
in
the
first
finding,
judge
dawson
found
that
prior
to
may
1,
1925,
several
years
prior
and
several
years
thereafter,
"costello
was"
and
i
quote
the
court,
"actively
and
extensively
engaged
in
the
occupation
of
smuggling,
trucking,
storing,
purchasing
and
dealing
in
alcoholic
beverages
in
violation
of
law."
and
he
finds
secondly
that
the
real
occupation
of
costello
at
the
time
was
not
real
estate
but
was
bootlegging.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
well,
i
would
argue,
your
honor,
that
at
least
a
person
is
under
an
obligation
when
he
is
called
upon
to
state
his
occupation,
to
state
that
which
is
his
predominant
occupation,
the
occupation
in
which
he
is
engaged
everyday,
the
occupation
which
provides
in
his
income.
and
i
will
seek
--
show
that
the
government's
proof
here
established
that
as
of
the
time
when
costello
petitioned
for
naturalization,
his
daily
activity
was
bootlegging.
that
produced
all
of
his
income.
in
the
year
1925,
this
realty
company
purchased
one
piece
of
property.
that
property
had
not
been
sold
when
petitioner
petitioned
for
naturalization.
so
as
of
the
time,
that
all
three
of
his
statements
were
made,
that
petitioner
was
engaged
in
real
estate.
the
fact
was
that
petitioner
had
not
derived
one
penny
from
the
occupation
which
he
gave
on
his
form.
now,
i
--
i
do
intend
to
show
in
contrast
to
that
the
nature
and
the
extent
of
the
bootlegging
activity.
and
the
conclusion
which
i
would
reach
by
this
recital
is
that
on
the
fact
shown,
there
could've
been
no
misunderstanding
as
to
what
was
called
for
by
the
question.
and
on
the
fact
shown,
the
representation
made
can
only
be
viewed
as
false.
and
that,
of
course,
was
the
third
finding
that
the
district
court
made,
that
the
representations
were
willfully
and
fraudulently
made.
now,
before
going
beyond
the
findings
--
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
we
think
it
shows
at
best
that
at
the
time
that
he
was
naturalized,
he
was
but
incidentally
engaged
in
that.
he
had
made
one
investment.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
the
record
shows
that
the
--
when
the
koslo
corporation
was
organized
in
19
--
close
end
of
1924,
it
made
one
purchase
of
real
estate.
that
was
before
the
petition
for
naturalization
was
filed.
the
record
further
shows
that
that
piece
of
real
estate
was
sold
some
months
after
the
petition
for
naturalization
was
filed,
some
months
after
all
three
of
the
representations
were
made.
it
shows
additionally
that
in
the
following
year,
in
1926,
this
realty
company
made
several
additional
transactions.
incidentally,
the
record
shows
that
the
money
that
was
put
into
real
estate
was
money
that
was
derived
from
the
bootlegging.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
i
think
it
is
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
what
his
primary
activity
was.
it
also
appears
that
the
--
the
real
estate
may
have
been
used
as
a
front
and
this
was
one
of
its
uses,
to
disguise
the
nature
of
the
lexington
avenue
office
which
was
actually
the
headquarters
from
which
a
giant
bootlegging
operation
was
conducted.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
the
--
the
property
records
show
the
transaction.
they
don't
--
they
don't
show
the
prices.
costello
testified
that
25
--
that
he
made
$25,000
when
this
property
was
sold.
the
purchase
was,
as
i've
indicated,
in
advance
of
the
misrepresentations
--
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
--
in
question.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
he
said
he
had
a
50%
interest
in
the
koslo
company.
now,
i
did
want
to
--
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
well,
he
certainly
had
--
if
he
made
a
good
purchase,
he
had
a
potential
source
of
income.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
he
had
a
prospect
in
making
money.
yes,
he
hadn't
derived
any
income
was
what
i
meant
to
say
as
of
the
time
that
he
made
the
statements.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
the
company
had
made
an
investment
on
the
background
--
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
he
did
later
that
year.
mr.
ralph
s.spritzer
yes.
