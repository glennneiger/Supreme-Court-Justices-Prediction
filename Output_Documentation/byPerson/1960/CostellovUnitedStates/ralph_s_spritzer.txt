mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors.
at
the
recess,
i
was
about
to
refer
before
dealing
with
the
particulars
of
the
evidence
to
certain
of
the
findings
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
which
reference
has
not
yet
been
made.
and
particularly,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
statement
in
judge
magruder's
opinion
at
record
248
where
he
states
in
reference
to
judge
dawson's
findings
that
not
only
were
they
not
clearly
erroneous
but
that
they
were,
and
i
quote
judge
magruder,
the
only
findings
possible
on
the
evidence
and
that
they
fulfilled
the
strictest
requirements
proof.
now,
i
emphasized
that
in
the
light
of
the
questions
which
were
raised
earlier
as
to
whether
there
was
any
lack
of
agreement
as
between
the
district
court
and
the
appellate
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
rested
on
any
imprints
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
vary
to
testify.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
he's
saying
the
district
court
might
have
gone
further.
and
as
to
the
point
that
was
made
in
relation
to
the
statement
by
the
court
of
appeals
that,
conceivably,
someone
could
believe
that
this
question
called
for
a
statement
of
legal
occupation,
perhaps,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
judge
magruder
went
on
to
find
in
this
case
that
a
worldly-wise
man
such
as
costello,
i'm
looking
at
page
250
now,
must
have
realized
that
his
real
occupation
was
bootlegging
and
that
he's
dabbling
in
real
estate
was
but
dust
in
the
eyes
to
conceal
his
occupation.
i
would
like
to
summarize
very
briefly
some
of
the
testimony
that
was
given
in
this
case
which
shows,
i
think,
what
the
nature
and
extent
of
costello's
activities
were
during
the
relevant
period.
costello
got
his
store
in
bootlegging
in
1921
when
he
joined
forces
with
one
emanuel
kessler.
kessler
testified
at
this
trial.
kessler
was
a
huge
operation.
he
owned
numerous
boats
including
an
ocean
vowing
steamer
which
went
regularly
back
and
forth
to
europe
to
bring
liquor
in.
kessler
testified
he
brought
in
about
500
cases
a
night
which
he
landed
on
the
northern
shore
of
long
island.
and
that
represents
at
the
going
price
of
liquor,
perhaps,
$15
million
worth
of
liquor
a
year.
now,
costello
and
his
brother
came
into
this
picture,
as
i
say,
in
1921.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
in
1921,
he
was
in
the
20s.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
by
1925
when
he
was
naturalized,
he
was
somewhere
around
30
years
of
age.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i
think
in
1890
or
something
as
i
recall.
i
think
1891,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that
--
that
--
yes,
that
he
was
born
in
1890s.
as
i
was
about
to
say,
costello
joined
this
operation
in
1921.
his
role
being
that
he
was
hired
to
truck
the
liquor
from
its
landing
place
to
places
of
storage
at
costello's
own
trucks.
they
owned
storage
facilities,
a
large
garage
and
a
large
residence
which
was
known
as
blackwell
mansion.
now,
kessler
went
to
jail
for
prohibition
violations
in
1923
and
he
moves
out
of
the
picture.
but
the
activities
of
costello
apparently
grew
a
pace
because
we
find
costello
testifying
that
one
cash
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
worth
of
liquor,
this
is
a
single
one
owned
by
kessler,
passed
to
the
hands
of
frank
costello
after
kessler
went
to
jail.
now,
kessler
dealt,
necessarily
dealt
regularly
with
costello
during
the
period
of
1921
to
1923
because
costello
was
the
man
who
moved
all
his
liquor
and
stored
it
all
for
him.
kessler
testified
that
the
costellos
had
a
lexington
avenue
office,
the
same
office
as
the
realty
company
has
as
its
office
address.
kessler
was
in
daily
communication
with
that
office
and
he
says
it
was
the
headquarters
for
the
liquor
operation
and
that
so
far
as
he
knew
and
he
went
to
the
office
frequently
in
addition
to
being
in
daily
telephone
communication.
so
far
as
he
knew,
there
was
never
any
real
estate
activity
at
the
office.
we
get
another
glimpse
of
the
scale
of
costello's
bootlegging
activities
from
one
albert
feldman,
who
also
testified
in
this
case,
also
a
bootlegger
during
the
1920s.
after
kessler
went
to
jail,
feldman,
who
had
previously
purchased
liquor
from
him,
began
purchasing
it
from
costello.
he
recalls
well
in
occasion
when
he
went
to
costello's
lexington
avenue
office
to
arrange
for
costello
to
pick
up,
to
store
and
to
sell
on
feldman's
the
half
a
thousand
of
cases
of
liquor
which
feldman
owned.
feldman
says
he
went
to
costello
because
it
was
well-known
in
the
bootlegging
trade
that
costello
had
large
facilities
for
engaging
in
the
liquor
traffic.
costello
accepted
that
proposal
of
feldman's
and
feldman
says
that
he
remembers
the
transaction
well
because
costello
told
him
later
that
the
liquor
had
been
hijacked
and
costello
thereupon
refused
to
pay
him
anything
for
it.
there
were
other
witnesses
who
were
involved
in
the
bootlegging
trade
in
the
period
of
the
1920s
who
dealt
with
frank
costello
at
this
lexington
avenue
office,
none
of
whom
ever
saw
any
sign
of
real
estate
activity.
i'm
going
to
mention
one
more
witness
at
this
time,
and
that
witness
was
a
ms.
helen
sausser.
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
man
named
harry
sausser
who
died
in
1926
and
who
had
been
associated
that
the
last
years
of
his
life
with
frank
costello.
harry
sausser,
the
daughter
testified,
was
the
man
who
arranged
for
shipments
of
liquor
from
canada
for
costello.
ms.
sausser
was
in
the
lexington
avenue
office
as
the
young
lady
from
time
to
time.
she
testified
that
this
office
was
the
headquarters
of
the
bootlegging
operation
and
that
she
never
saw
any
suggestion
that
any
other
business
was
conducted
there.
she
also
testified
that
her
father
never
had
anything
to
do
with
real
estate.
now,
that's
particularly
significant
because
harry
sausser's
name
was
given
by
frank
costello
to
the
naturalization
authorities
as
a
character
witness
on
the
preliminary
form.
frank
costello
listed
harry
sausser's
occupation
as
real
--
real
estate.
though,
according
to
the
daughter,
harry
sausser
never
had
anything
to
do
with
real
estate
and
certainly,
that
bears
on
specific
intent
on
the
question
whether
frank
costello
sincerely
misapprehended
an
instruction
when
he
wrote
real
estate
down
as
his
own
occupation,
for
he
wrote
the
same
down
for
a
man
who,
according
to
the
testimony,
never
had
any
relation
to
the
koslo
realty
company
or
any
other
real
estate
business.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
she
was
about
18,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
now,
i've
spoken
thus
far
of
the
testimony
of
some
of
the
government's
witnesses
who
were
engaged
in
business
with
costello
during
the
1920s.
let
me
turn
now
to
costello's
admissions
on
various
occasions.
mr.
williams
has
mentioned
that
in
1938,
costello
stated
to
an
internal
revenue
agent
that
in
the
1920s,
he
was
engaged
in
the
liquor
business.
in
1938,
testifying
before
federal
grand
jury,
costello
stated
that
he
had
operated
a
bootlegging
enterprise
until
1926.
now,
costello
made
further
admissions
on
three
other
occasions.
and
these
further
admissions
occurred
after
wiretapping
by
new
york
state
authority.
i'm
going
to
refer
later
to
the
question
whether
there
was
any
taint
in
respect
to
this
evidence.
i'd
like
to
refer
--
tell
your
honors
first
what
the
substance
of
this
evidence
was.
now,
there
were
admissions
on
three
occasions
after
1943.
the
first
was
before
a
new
york
state
grand
jury
which
was
investigating
the
question
of
costello's
relationships
with
thomas
aurelio
in
respect
to
the
procurement
of
a
judicial
nomination.
concurrently
or
at
least
very
shortly
after
that
investigation,
there
was
a
second
inquiry
which
was
made
by
the
--
before
a
referee
of
the
appellate
division
of
new
york
county,
this
arose
out
of
the
same
matter.
the
referee
was
conducting
a
proceeding
to
determine
on
behalf
of
the
court
whether
there
were
reasons
why
thomas
aurelio
should
be
disbarred
or
suspended
from
law
practice.
costello
made
admissions
again
before
new
york
authorities
in
a
1947
proceeding
conducted
by
the
new
york
state
liquor
authority.
that
was
the
licensing
matter
of
the
date.
now,
on
these
occasions,
costello
again
admitted
that
in
the
1920s,
he's
been
a
bootlegger
that
that
has
been
his
activity.
he
gave
some
details
that
he
owned
trucks
for
hauling
liquor,
that
he
charted
boats
for
that
purpose,
that
the
headquarters
of
the
liquor
operation
was
the
lexington
avenue
office,
that
he
got
liquor
from
the
canadian
sources,
that
liquor
traffic
was
profitable
and
he
made
substantial
sums
of
money
from
the
trade
and
that
the
sum
of
this
money
made
from
the
liquor
business
or
from
gambling
he
invested
in
real
estate.
essentially,
this
testimony
confirmed
costello's
earlier
admissions
and
the
specific
testimony
are
given
by
the
people
who
had
done
business
with
costello
in
this
instant
trial.
now,
weighing
this
evidence
as
to
regular
extensive
day-to-day
bootlegging
operations
directed
from
the
lexington
avenue
office
against
the
evidence
that
the
koslo
realty
company
was
organized
and
concurrently
made
one
purchase
of
property
and
that's
all
that
had
taken
place
as
of
the
naturalization
date.
then
i
think
it
becomes
understandable
that
justice
--
that
judge
magruder
concluded
that
from
this
record,
there
was
no
other
conclusion
possible
but
that
costello
knowingly
misrepresented
his
occupation.
he
could
hardly
have
believed
since
the
immigration
authorities
were
investigating
his
moral
character
that
he
was
at
liberty
to
suppress
the
occupation
which
was
illegal
and
which
would
--
reflected
adversely.
and
certainly,
there
could
have
been
no
misapprehension,
we
believe,
in
a
case
in
which
there
was
this
imbalance
as
between
the
one
activity
and
the
other.
the
one
activity,
as
i
say,
daily
far-flung
and
profitable
and
the
other,
at
that
point,
consisting
of
a
single
investment.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
real
estate?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
chartered
ships,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
owned
trucks.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
there's
this
indication
that
he
started
out
in
1921
with
this
man
kessler
and
he
was
then
being
paid
by
the
case
for
trucking
and
storing
the
liquor.
he
apparently
did
not
have
a
great
deal
of
capital
to
begin
with
because
kessler
helped
him
finance
the
purchase
of
the
trucks.
the
indication
that
the
bootlegging
operation
became
a
big
one,
one
indication
is
that
he
succeeded
when
kessler
went
to
jail
to
one
unit
of
liquor
which
was
worth
two
--
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
loan.
so
it
did
become
a
substantial
operation
and
we
have
the
testimony
of
people
who
did
business
with
him
that
he
was
known
to
have
large
facilities
for
engaging
in
this
illicit
traffic.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
a
settlement
which
the
government
made
after
frank
costello
had
never
filed
an
income
tax
return
and
he
had
no
records.
and
this
was
the
settlement.
it
was
apparently
with
the
government
could
prove
or
dealt.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
for
13
years,
he
had
not
filed
any
tax
returns.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
ultimately
settled
with
the
state
and
federal
governments.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
what
--
whether
there
was
income
which
could
never
be
traced
if
something
which
is,
of
course,
not
possible
to
say
on
this
record.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
other
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
certainly,
the
facts
which
the
witnesses
of
this
trial
testified
to
make
it
appear
that
this
was
a
substantial
bootlegging
operation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
--
a
substantial
bootlegging
operation.
and
the
court
found
that
that
was
his
--
at
least
his
full
time
activity.
that
the
--
there
were
daily
transactions.
now,
we're
in
the
realm
of
speculation
when
we
attempt
to
estimate
how
much
money
he
made
from
it.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
figures
as
to
income?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
--
mr.
williams
informs
me,
i
believe.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
correct
that
the
government
offered
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
this
return.
our
case
is
not,
in
any
event,
--
that
then
upon
any
finding
and
there
is
none
as
to
how
large
the
operation
was.
it
does
depend
upon
the
finding
that
this
was
his
full
time
activity,
that
this
was
the
source
of
his
income.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh,
the
first
witness
was
the
man
named
kessler
for
whom
costello
originally
did
this
trucking
and
storing.
another
witness
was
the
man
named
feldman
who
was
also
a
bootlegger
and
dealt
with
costello.
a
third
witness
was
helen
sausser
who
was
the
daughter
of
one
of
costello's
associates.
there
were
others,
and
i,
of
course,
have
not
the
time
to
attempt
to
deal
with
all
the
--
to
summarize
all
of
the
testimony.
i
--
i
summarized
that
testimony
because
it
shows
--
is
--
it's
the
testimony
which
shows
and
there's
other
of
like
kind
that
there
was
a
regular
business
of
bootlegging
which
was
conducted
through
this
lexington
avenue
office
that
people
dealt
there
on
a
regular
or
a
daily
or
a
weekly
basis
depending
upon
the
character
of
the
purchases
or
the
character
of
the
arrangements
they
were
making.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
the
question
whether
a
portion
of
the
government's
case,
as
mr.
williams
has
argued,
was
tainted
by
the
wiretapping
which
the
state
authorities
conducted
in
1943.
now,
again,
i
think
i
must
give
the
court
some
of
the
background
facts.
in
1943,
the
then
new
york
county
district
attorney
and
also
--
still
the
new
york
county
district
attorney
frank
hogan
was
investigating
suspected
criminal
activity
on
the
part
of
frank
costello.
and
hogan
obtained
from
the
new
york
courts
an
order
authorizing
the
new
york
authorities
to
tap
costello's
private
unlisted
telephone.
for
some
months
thereafter,
and
i
think
that
begin
in
may
of
1943,
transcriptions
of
all
of
costello's
telephone
calls
were
made
and
reported.
in
august
or
september
of
1943,
there
were
a
number
of
intercepted
communications
which
seems
to
disclose
a
close
relationship
between
costello
and
one
thomas
aurelio,
a
candidate
for
a
supreme
court
justiceship
in
new
york.
district
attorney
hogan
testified
in
the
instant
trial
that
in
all
events,
there
would
have
been
a
grand
jury
inquiry
in
relation
to
frank
costello
and
his
activities.
he
testified
further
that
when
this
information,
this
conversation
--
these
conversations
between
mr.
costello
and
mr.
aurelio
came
to
his
attention,
he
decided
that
there
should
be
a
grand
--
grand
jury
inquiry
sooner
rather
than
later.
and
that
--
as
a
matter
fact,
one
should
be
held
immediately
in
view
of
the
impending
election
in
which
mr.
aurelio
was
a
candidate.
and
so
in
the
fall
of
1943,
there
was
a
grand
jury
inquiry
into
the
question
whether
aurelio's
nomination
had
been
influenced
by
improper
or
criminal
influences.
and
shortly
thereafter,
there
was
also
the
appellate
division
inquiry
to
which
i've
earlier
made
reference.
now,
district
attorney
hogan
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
before
the
appellate
division
referee.
and
on
both
occasions,
he
did
question
costello
at
length.
and
he
did
show
him.
and
he
did
read
into
the
record
numerous
transcriptions
which
had
been
obtained
from
this
wiretapping.
it
does
not
appear
anywhere,
however,
that
any
of
costello's
1943
conversations
related
in
anyway
to
his
having
been
engaged
in
the
bootlegging
business
some
15
or
more
years
earlier.and
district
attorney
hogan
testified
at
the
trial
of
this
case
that
no
information
of
that
kind
was
derived
from
the
wiretappings.
now,
hogan
did
go
on
and
asked
costello
at
the
grand
jury
inquiry
and
before
the
appellate
division
referee
what
his
background
and
what
his
history
were.
hogan,
himself,
knew,
he
tells
us,
or
had
reason
to
believe
at
least,
that
costello
had
been
a
bootlegger,
he
--
that
he
had
word
of
that
from
police
and
other
sources.
now,
petitioner
does
not
contend
in
his
brief
and
he
has
no
basis
for
contending
on
the
proof
that
the
1943
wiretapping
revealed
any
information
about
bootlegging,
which
incidentally
had
terminated
according
to
costello
some
17
years
earlier
in
1926.
as
i've
said,
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
testified
in
this
case
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
new
york
authorities
got
no
evidence
in
relation
to
bootlegging
when
they
tapped
the
phone
in
1943.
and
so
what
mr.
williams
contention
really
is,
is
this.
first,
he
says
that
the
wiretapping
was
illegal.
second,
he
says
that
the
wiretapping
precipitated
as
it
did.
a
grand
jury
inquiry
precipitated
it
in
the
sense
that
it
made
a
tape
place
sooner
than
it
otherwise
would
have.
and
third,
he
says
that
it
was
on
this
occasion,
on
the
occasion
of
the
grand
jury
inquiry
that
the
admissions
in
question
were
made.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
the
admissions
in
--
were
made
on
which
the
government
relied.
now,
certainly,
this
court
has
said
in
--
in
silverthorne
and
in
the
second
nardone
case
that
the
policy
against
the
use
of
illegal
or
tainted
evidence
in
the
federal
court
is
not
to
be
circumvented
on
the
part
of
law
enforcement
authorities
by
substituting
for
illegal
evidence,
some
other
evidence
which
is
immediately
derived
from
that
illegal
evidence.
but
in
this
case,
i
point
out,
there
was
no
use
of
derivity
of
evidence
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
bootlegging
operations
obtained
by
the
wiretapping
activities
of
the
new
york
police.
and
thus,
there
is
not
here
the
--
the
fruit
of
wiretapping.
there
is
not
the
kind
of
direct
or
approximate
causation
which
this
court
said
in
the
second
nardone
case
must
be
present.
rather,
we
have
the
claim
of
--
kind
of
claim
of
attenuated
relationship
which
the
court
said
in
nardone
that
would
not
serve
as
a
basis
for
applying
a
rule
of
exclusion.
now,
petitioner
also
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
sir.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
is
that
his
brief
your
honors
are
referring
to?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
oh.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
quite
get
the
reference
your
honor
was
making
to
23.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
think
that
mr.
williams
stated
that
and
the
--
all
of
the
evidence
--
i
don't
think
he
could've
stated
that
because
all
of
the
evidence
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
is
otherwise.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
what
mr.
williams
argument
was
--
was
this.
he
can
correct
me
later
if
i
--
if
i
misinterpret
him,
of
course.
his
argument
is
that
but
for
the
wiretapping,
the
grand
jury
inquiry
wouldn't
have
been
held
when
it
was
and
if
it
hadn't
been
held
when
it
was,
then
costello
would
have
been
questioned
when
he
was.
and
if
he
hadn't
been
questioned
when
he
was,
then
he
wouldn't
have
made
these
admissions.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
in
a
sense.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
there's
the
most
--
there's
explicit
testimony
nowhere
contradicted
in
findings,
the
testimony
of
district
attorney
hogan
that
no
evidence
of
bootlegging
was
obtained
by
the
new
york
state
wiretapping.
there
was
also
a
finding
that
no
earlier
wiretapping
had
produced
any
evidence
of
bootlegging
activity.
so
the
argument
has
to
be,
on
petitioner's
behalf,
that
whatever
was
brought
out
at
the
grand
jury
inquiry
was
tainted,
if
the
grand
jury
inquiry
was
prompted
by
wiretapping.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
very.
very
voluminous.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
a
period
of
months.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
suspect
that
it
was
continuous.
i
would
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
suspect
that
it
was
recorded.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
wasn't
in
the
bootlegging
business
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
that
period.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
he
got
out
of
the
bootlegging
business.
he
says
at
one
time,
he
says
1926.
at
another
time,
he
said
about
1930
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
but
in
all
events,
before
the
repeal
of
prohibition.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
pardon.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
hogan's
wiretapping
was
between
may
and
november
of
1943.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
there
was
a
claim
that
there
was
some
tapping
back
in
1925
by
federal
authority
and
the
district
found
on
that
but
they
didn't
get
any
evidence.
that
they
didn't
get
any
--
that
those
taps
didn't
yield
any
evidence.
there
was
some
tapping
done,
apparently,
by
federal
authorities
of
this
building
which
costello
occupied
some
years
before.
the
only
taps
which
seemed
to
be
seriously
an
issue
in
the
basis
of
petitioner's
present
contention
are
these
1943
taps,
which
i
have
been
referring
to.
and
hawking
back
just
one
moment
to
justice
black's
question,
i
think
that
the
courts
below
were
perfectly
clear
as
to
what
petitioner's
contention
was.
because
the
district
court
had
record
41
and
42,
summarizes
that
contention
and
says,
"the
petitioner's
contention
would
mean
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
41,
bottom
of
41.
"would
mean
that
a
man
whose
telephone
had
been
tapped
would
be
granted
immunity
for
any
admissions
which
he
thereafter
made,
not
in
the
telephone
conversations,
but
in
answer
to
any
questions
in
a
later
investigation."
that's
very
bottom
of
41
and
the
top
of
42,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
now,
petitioner
does
attempt
to
buttress
this
claim
of
a
--
of
a
cause
or
relationship
by
suggesting
that
costello
might
not
have
been
sure.
but
what
he
might
not
had
made
some
statements
on
the
telephone
which
had
something
to
do
with
bootlegging
or
bore
on
that,
and
since
he
would
have
this
lack
of
servitude
as
to
what
he'd
said
and
what
he'd
been
overheard
that
he
might
had
been
induced
by
that
to
speak
out
and
tell
the
truth
when
otherwise
he
wouldn't
have
done
so.
now,
costello
has,
of
course,
has
never
testified
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
under
this
constraint.
but
putting
that
apart,
i
suggest
that
the
argument
breaks
down
in
all
events
because
costello
was
under
constraint
when
hogan
questioned
him
as
to
his
earlier
history
because
he,
costello,
had
previously
stated
on
at
least
two
occasions
in
sworn
testimony,
once
before
a
revenue
agent
and
the
second
time,
before
a
federal
grand
jury
that
he
had
been
in
the
bootlegging
business.
and
so
if
there
was
constraint,
it
came
from
costello's
own
earlier
admissions.
now,
i
should
like
to
deal
finally
with
petitioner's
request
that
the
court
take
into
account
in
its
judgement
in
this
case
the
substantial
lapse
of
time,
and
it
was
very
substantial,
between
the
date
of
naturalization,
which
was
1925,
and
the
date
when
the
government
filed
its
first
denaturalization
complaint,
1952.
i
think
the
primary
answer
to
that
contention
is
that
congress
has
very
deliberately
decided
whether
one
views
its
policy
in
the
matter
as
enlightened
or
unenlightened.
it
is
very
deliberately
decided
that
there
shall
be
no
time
bar
in
respect
to
the
bringing
of
suits
to
cancel
a
certificate
of
naturalization
fraudulently
obtained.
that
has
been
the
clear
meaning,
and
i
put
it
to
your
honors,
of
the
cancellation
provision
since
1906.
now,
there
has
been
a
succession
of
changes
in
the
immigration
act.
but
this
provision
relating
to
cancellation
has
remained
substantially
unchanged
for
over
50
years.
and
the
provision
as
it
now
reads
in
the
1952
act
is
set
out
in
the
government's
brief
at
pages
3
and
4,
the
bottom
of
page
3.
and
the
court
will
note
that
this
cancellation
procedure
is
made
specifically
applicable
by
this
subsection
(i)
to
any
naturalization
granted
under
the
provisions
of
this
subchapter
and
to
any
naturalization
heretofore
granted
by
any
court
and
to
all
certificates
of
naturalization
and
citizenship
which
may
have
been
issued
heretofore
by
any
court
or
by
the
commissioner
and
so
forth.
and
as
i
say,
that
all
inclusive
language
has
been
in
the
statute
--
in
the
statute
since
1906.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
think,
that
is
--
those
alternatives
are
to
take
care
of
every
situation.
in
another
words,
when
you
take
them
altogether,
the
certificate
heretofore
issued
by
any
court
or
by
the
commissioner
or
by
a
designated
representative
under
that
provision
or
by
such
designated
representative
under
any
other
act,
then
one,
i
think,
has
all
the
circumstances
in
which
a
prior
certificate
might
have
been
issued.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
has
not
been,
to
my
knowledge.
there
is
some
legislative
history
and
it
is
referred
to
at
page
55
of
the
government's
brief
in
connection
with
the
1906
act
which
first
put
this
provision
into
the
law.
and
that
the
house
report
to
which
we
there
refer
shows
that
congress
had
been
concerned
--
had
become
concerned
and
somewhat
alarmed
at
the
gross
frauds
which
in
its
view
were
being
perpetrated.
the
report
points
out
that
immigration
had
become
very
great
in
volume,
that
the
number
of
persons
naturalized
was
immense,
that
the
bureau
of
naturalization,
as
it
was
then
called,
was
very
small
in
number
and
that
they
had
to
accept
the
statements
made
by
the
applicant
at
face
value.
and
the
congress
went
on
to
state
that
because
of
the
grossness
and
number
of
frauds
which
it
felt
were
being
perpetrated
that
it
wanted
to
do
all
that
the
constitution
permitted
it
to
do,
to
provide
that
the
attorney
general
might
thereafter
cancel
any
certificate
which
had
been
illegally
or
fraudulently
procured
in
the
first
instance.
now,
that
is
the
history
of
the
--
of
the
provision
and
as
i
say
that
is
the
direct
ancestor
of
the
provision
that
is
now
in
the
law
and
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
it
is
clear
that
congress
deliberately
decided
in
1906
that
it
was
going
to
make
this
provision
for
cancellation,
which
it
enacted
at
that
time,
applicable
to
certificates
issued
in
the
past
and
not
merely
to
certificates
which
would
thereafter
be
issued
under
the
1906
act.
this
court
had
that
question
before
it
in
the
johannessen
case
and
it
ruled
that
the
legislation
did
plainly
contemplate
that
the
cancellation
provision
enacted
in
1906
would
be
retrospective
in
application
and
the
court
upheld
such
an
application
in
the
johannessen
case.
so,
the
deliberately
rejected
language
is
correct,
i
think,
if
in
--
in
the
sense
that
congress
fully
intended
to
make
it
applicable
as
i
read
the
history
and
as
i
read
the
statutory
language
to
any
certificate
granted
at
anytime,
no
matter
how
remotely
in
the
past.
now,
if
there
has
been
no
legislation
offered
to
my
knowledge,
and
i
have
inquired
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
service
and
he
has
no
knowledge
of
any
bill
having
been
introduced
at
anytime
to
establish
a
period
of
limitations.
so
there
has
been
no
rejection
of
--
in
that
sense
of
a
proposal
of
a
specific
proposal
to
impose
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
--
there
maybe,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
come
in
my
mind.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
were
extensive
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes,
that
the
1906
act,
as
your
honor
correctly
recalls,
followed
a
very
extensive
investigation
by
a
presidential
commission
in
1905.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
certainly
think,
your
honor,
that
in
situations
where
a
doctrine
of
laches
is
applicable
and
the
government
argues
that
it
is
not
here
applicable
in
view
of
the
policy
declared
in
the
statute
and
in
view
of
the
settled
policy
of
this
court
that
laches
would
not
be
applied
to
the
united
states.
but
in
cases
in
which
that
doctrine
is
applicable,
then,
certainly,
one
of
the
things
which
an
equity
court
requires
to
be
shown
before
it
holds
a
person
barred
by
laches
is
that
there
has
been
prejudice.
now,
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
petitioner
has
not
been
prejudiced
from
the
standpoint
of
adequately
presenting
his
case
because
the
burden
and
let's
say,
heavy
burden,
this
court
has
stated,
of
proving
convincingly
that
the
representation
was
false
is
upon
the
government
and
to
the
extent
that
the
lapse
of
time
or
the
deeming
of
recollections
makes
the
case
an
unconvincing
or
an
unpersuasive
one,
then
it
furnishes
the
basis
for
holding
against
the
government
and
not
a
basis
for
holding
in
its
favor.
now,
i
think
in
this
case,
costello
could
hardly
claim
in
the
light
of
his
own
repeated
admissions
that
he
wasn't
substantially
engaged
in
bootlegging.
as
for
his
real
estate
activity,
the
government
made
a
complete
search
of
the
records
and
it
put
in
the
evidence
of
the
transactions
which
took
place.
if
there
were
any
additional
transactions,
certainly,
the
defense
would
be
in
a
position
to
put
in
records
of
such
transactions.
such
evidence
does
not
disappear
with
the
lapse
of
time.
and
mr.
williams
did
suggest,
the
government
didn't
put
in
evidence
showing
that
this
koslo
realty
company
didn't
do
business
somewhere
else
besides
new
york
city.
we'll
look
back
there
with
costello,
himself,
testified
in
the
--
before
the
new
york
grand
jury
and
his
testimony
was
made
a
part
of
this
record
that
he
had
done
a
little
real
estate
in
new
york
in
bronx
county.
and
so
the
federal
agents,
who
investigated
this
matter,
went
through
the
entire
records
of
new
york
in
bronx
county
over
the
entire
period
of
time
involved
no
small
task,
something
which
was
necessary
because
they
apparently
had
no
access
to
any
of
the
petitioner's
records
if
any
still
existed.
in
addition,
it
checked
the
two
other
principle
boroughs
of
new
york
city,
brooklyn
and
queens.
so,
the
--
the
government
did
investigate
every
lead
fully.
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
defense
couldn't
have
produced
further
evidence
if
they're
--
if
it
thought
that
this
investigation
had
been
in
any
way
deficient.
however,
the
defense
offered
no
evidence.
i
suggest
the
only
additional
evidence
which
could
have
had
some
significance
in
this
case
is
if
frank
costello,
himself,
had
been
prepared
to
testify
that
for
some
inexplicable
reason,
he
didn't
understand
what
was
meant
three
times
by
the
directions
"state
your
present
occupation".
but
if
--
if
there
could've
been
some
special
explanation,
some
alibi,
some
affirmative
defense,
as
it
were,
based
upon
his
lack
of
understanding,
he's
not
understanding
these
words
the
way
any
ordinary
person
would.
certainly,
he
was
not
prejudiced
in
--
by
the
lapse
time
in
offering
such
evidence
because
he
was
still
here
to
testify.
now,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly,
though
i
--
i
don't
think
it
is
a
question
that
the
court
had
any
occasion
to
reach
upon
the
repeated
statement
that
the
government
knew
about
all
this
all
the
time.
i
suppose
it
all
depends
on
whether
one
views
the
government
as
a
unit
in
which
every
finger
and
toe
knows
all
the
time
what
every
other
finger
and
toe
and
toe
is
doing.
now,
it's
certainly
true
that
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
1925
had
some
reason
to
believe
that
costello
was
engaged
in
bootlegging
or
he
wouldn't
procured
an
indictment.
it
does
not
follow
that
the
immigration
service
which
was
then
part
of
the
department
of
labor
and
was
administering
records
which
involved
literally
millions
of
applicants
for
naturalization
and
naturalized
citizens,
immediately
had
a
light
to
go
in
its
office
when
the
u.s.
attorney
brought
a
proceeding
against
one
frank
costello.
the
only
way
in
which
this
could've
been
correlated
would've
been
if
the
united
states
attorney
found
out
in
the
course
of
his
investigation
that
costello
was
naturalized
rather
than
natural
born,
if
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
have
misrepresented
his
occupation
and
if
he
had
brought
that
to
the
attention
of
the
immigration
service.
that
is
--
is
not
an
automatic
kind
of
correlation.
and
it
is
a
difficult
matter.
i
think
your
honor
should
appreciate
to
post
audit,
as
it
were,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
affidavits
and
applications
which
have
been
filed,
which
have
been
acted
upon
in
the
certificates
issued.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
immigration
service
does
not
attempt
to
conduct
a
continuing
surveillance
of
persons
who
have
been
naturalized,
when
fact
do
come
to
its
attention
which
makes
it
believe
that
there's
basis
for
charging
a
fraud
than
it
does
proceed.
this
record
does
not
show
when
the
immigration
service
first
had
these
apparent
discrepancies
called
to
its
attention.
petitioner's
counsel
did
make
an
effort
to
find
that
out
in
--
in
what
has
been
referred
to
as
the
prior
trial,
the
one
which
the
case
which
came
up
here
ultimately
on
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
point.
and
that
record,
of
course,
since
that
case
came
to
this
court
is
part
of
the
court's
files
and
the
court
has
stated,
i
believe
it
was
in
united
states
against
pink
that
it
was
at
liberty
to
look
at
a
record
in
a
prior
case
which
had
come
to
this
court.
and
so
i
called
to
your
honors'
attention
that
the
attorney
who
prepared
the
government's
case
and
who
signed
the
affidavit
of
good
cause
for
the
institution
of
this
case
was
questioned
at
the
1952
trial
as
to
when
these
matters
had
first
come
to
the
service's
attention.
and
in
answer
to
such
a
question,
he
stated,
and
this
is
at
page
48
of
the
earlier
costello
case,
"frank
costello
was
arrested
for
bootlegging
activities
in
december
of
1925
and
subsequently
indicted
in
connection
with
that
arrest.
a
trial
ensued
and
a
jury
disagreement
resulted
as
to
frank
costello."
i
--
i
interpolate
parenthetically
here
that
frank
costello
was
one
of
30
odd
defendants
in
that
bootlegging
case.
now,
resuming
the
quote
"so,
certainly,
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
southern
district
had
some
information
as
to
activities
on
the
part
of
frank
costello
other
than
real
estate
at
that
time."
so
far
as
i
know,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
had
no
knowledge
until
1947
concerning
such
activities
or
that
the
frank
costello
so
arrested
and
tried
was
the
frank
costello
naturalized
in
september
1925.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--
i
think
in
the
first
instance
that
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
district
court
regarded
the
government's
affirmative
case
made
out
by
its
own
witnesses,
people
who
had
done
business
with
costello,
and
has
made
out
by
costello's
extrajudicial
admissions
as
a
complete
and
convincing
case
and
that
the
district
court
placed
no
reliance
whatever
upon
the
failure
of
costello
to
testify.
i
do
not
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
to
say,
at
any
point,
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
such
an
inference
in
order
to
sustain
the
district
court's
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
does
say
that
it
believes
that
the
district
court
might
indeed
have
gone
further
than
it
did
and
made
an
inference
based
upon
his
silence.
but
the
court
of
appeals
finds
in
full
agreement
as
i
read
its
opinion
that
the
district
court's
findings
were
the
only
findings
possible
on
this
record.
and
so,
i
think,
it
has
placed
no
reliance
from
the
standpoint
of
finding
the
evidence
sufficient
to
justify
affirmance
on
the
fact
that
costello
did
not
testify.
now,
i'd
refer
to
the
fact
that
costello
if
might
have
testified
or
might
have
offered
evidence
on
this
point
or
that
if
he
thought
there
were
additional
evidence.
i'm
not
saying,
when
i
say
that,
that
the
government
has
here
made
out
in
its
case
or
relied
on
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
silence.
i'm
merely
making
the
point,
and
i
think
it'd
be
true
in
any
criminal
case
that
there
are
certain
matters
which
the
defense
may
offer
if
it
thinks
it
can
offer
anything
more
just
as
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
can
offer
an
alibi
that
he
wasn't
aware
the
prosecution's
witnesses
placed
him
at
a
given
time.
so
costello
could've
testified
if
he
thought
he
was
--
that
the
facts
justify
that
he
didn't
understand
the
question.
but
i
think
the
government
has
made
out
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
assume
the
government
could've
called
him
in
all
events,
your
honor,
under
this
court's
wah
suey
or
bilokumsky
against
tod
cases.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
--i'd
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
inference
there
was
based
upon
his
failure
to
answer
a
question
as
i
recall.
wah
suey
was
called
in
a
deportation
case.
and
evidence
was
offered
the
day
a
dr.
wah
suey
had
written
a
great
many
books
which
advocated
revolution.
he
was
called
to
the
stand
and
he
was
asked
whether
he
was
the
author
of
those
books.
and
--
and
he
remained
silent.
and
this
court
stated
in
that
case
that
since
he
did
not
base
his
silence
upon
any
claim
of
privilege
that
an
inference
could
be
drawn.
i'm
--
i
don't
think
there's
necessity
in
this
case
for
this
court
to
deal
with
the
question
whether
inference
is
ought
to
be
drawn
from
silence
in
a
denaturalization
case
because
i
don't
think
that
the
lower
court
did
or
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
rests
on
any
such
inference.
but
it
seems
to
me
if
the
question
is
here,
then
the
court
would
has,
as
i
read
these
unanimous
opinions
of
--
i
guess
justice
brandeis
wrote
for
the
court
in
bilokumsky
and
justice
stone
in
wah
suey.
those
opinions
do
state
that
since
it
is
a
civil
proceeding,
an
inference
from
silence
maybe
drawn,
absent
and
assertion
of
privilege
by
the
defendant
in
proceeding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
those
--
the
wah
suey
and
the
bilokumsky
cases
so
far
as
i
recall
at
the
moment
are
the
only
cases
in
the
field
of
deportation
and
--
and
denaturalization.
and
as
i
say,
i
--
i
read
then
as
indicating
that
inferences
could
be
drawn
from
silence
but
we
have
not
made
any
full
rest
argument.
i
don't
know
it
would
make
any
argument
on
that
score
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
in
the
brief
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
because
we
don't
view
this
judgment
as
raising
any
such
problem
for
the
court's
consideration.
