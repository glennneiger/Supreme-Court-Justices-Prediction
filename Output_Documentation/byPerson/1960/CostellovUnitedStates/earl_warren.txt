mr.
williams.
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
there
any
questions
comparable
to
that
in
--
in
this
proceeding
in
1925,
mr.
williams?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
was
in
what
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
when
was
that
with
relation
to
these
proceedings
we've
been
talking
about.
what
day
and
--
what
day
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
this
is
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
i
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
wonder
if
we
can
assume
that
the
only
transaction
prior
to
real
estate
transaction,
prior
to
--
to
his
statement
that
he
was
in
the
--
the
real
estate
business
was
a
purchase
of
property
that
he
did
not
make
any
money
by
virtue
of
the
real
estate
business.
in
other
words,
my
point
is
this.
suppose
--
suppose
he'd
had
a
dozen
purchases
of
property
but
he
hadn't
sold
any,
does
that
mean
necessarily
that
--
that
he
hadn't
made
any
money
by
--
in
the
business
by
reason
of
his
purchase
of
these
properties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
he
hadn't
made
a
nickel.
he
hadn't
made
a
nickel
in
the
business
at
the
time
that
he
made
this
statement?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
if
he
made
a
good
buy,
he'd
made
some
money,
hadn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
he
did
in
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he
did
in
that
same
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
we'll
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
old
is
she
at
that
time
mr.
spritzer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
18.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
indication
that
his
business
grew
as
time
went
on,
became
greater
or
that
he
start
in
that
this
is
a
big
business?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i'm
talking
about
the
bootlegging
business
as
you
have
outlined
to
assess.
that's
a
rather
large
proportions
of
the
--
he
bought
ships
and
trucks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
chartered
ships.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
he
owned
trucks
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
at
his
operation,
quite
an
operation.
is
there
any
indication
that
that
accelerated
as
--
through
the
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
it
true
that
the
--
that
the
record
shows
--
i
thought
i
understood
mr.
williams
to
say
so
that
the
--
that
his
income
for
13
years
aggregated
on
a
little
over
$300,000?
chief
justice
earl
warren
federal
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
that
--
if
that
approximated,
what
--
what
is
his
income
was?
it
--
it
wouldn't
indicate
a
very
large
operation,
would
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
income
was
about
$17,000
a
year?
i
think
mr.
williams
said.
and
if,
as
you
say,
it
--
it
probably
increased
through
the
--
through
the
years
until
1932,
he
--
it
might
indicate
that
he's
in
--
on
a
pretty
small
scale
in
1925.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
offered
that
proof?
the
government
or
costello?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
who
did?
chief
justice
earl
warren
government.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
spritzer,
would
you
mind
addressing
yourself
for
a
moment
to
the
--
to
what
mr.
williams
call
the
dilemma
of
the
government
on
the
question
of
--
of
whether
he
could
be
called
as
a
witness
in
the
state,
if
he
--
in
this
kind
of
a
case
and
if
he
could,
then
it
was
the
--
would
have
been
the
duty
of
the
government
to
call
him
to
prove
certain
things
and
not
have
the
inferences
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
if
these
things
were
best
known
to
him
and
he
could've
brought
them
or
on
the
other
hand
if
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
he
couldn't
be
the
situation
had
been?

justice
