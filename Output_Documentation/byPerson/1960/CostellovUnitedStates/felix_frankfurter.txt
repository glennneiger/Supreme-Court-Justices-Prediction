does
that
mean
--
does
that
mean
that
the
--
i
don't
quite
follow,
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
same
reading,
the
same
reading,
the
printed
pages
of
which
the
district
judge
heard,
the
human
voice
couldn't
say
that
the
clear
allowable
inference
is
the
opposite
of
what
the
district
judge
refused
to
draw?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
case
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
case
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
inference
that
the
--
judge
dawson
rejected
the
court
of
appeals
to
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
on
what
basis
did
judge
dawson
reposed
drawing
such
an
inference?
i
can
understand
well
if
we
had
a
case
where
the
district
judge,
hearing
human
testimony,
disbelieved
or
interpreted
it
in
one
way?
what
--
we
haven't
got
that
situation
here,
have
we?
justice
felix
frankfurter
or
even
the
meaning
of
a
doctrine?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
conceded
--
conceded
--
what
shall
i
call
it?
conceded
material,
equally
accessible
and
equally
carrying
the
same
relevance
--
significance
of
reason
or
relevance
to
three
judges
or
to
the
one
judge.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
there
is
a
great
difference,
even
accepting
your
heavy
standards
of
burden
for
the
course
as
the
course
i
do.
and
i'm
just
curious
to
know
how
you
fence
in,
how
you
limit
the
--
the
doctrine
processes,
allow
that
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
will
not
indulge
in
by
the
district
court.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
--
judge
dawson
formulated
specific
findings,
he
--
he
drew
up,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five
findings.
now,
was
there
any
finding
that
he
made
that
the
court
of
appeals
rejected?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
one?
justice
felix
frankfurter
which
one
in
the
record,
beginning
with
page
27?
is
it
three
--
no,
that
it
shouldn't
be,
they
didn't
reject
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
they
didn't
reject
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
the
--
the
(inaudible)
that
when
defendant
in
his
petition
so
on,
swore
that
he
was
attached
to
it,
which
support
the
constitution,
he
was
engaged
in
extensive
activities
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
united
states.
they
didn't
reject
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
if
they
reject
to
that
then
they'd
be
rejecting
something
to
your
favor.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
insofar
they
did
that
as
i
say,
that's
--
you
got
no
grievance
on
that
story.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
i'm
--
well,
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
you're
quite
right.
all
i
meant
to
say,
what
finding
in
your
favor
that
the
district
judge
makes
if
the
court
of
appeals
rejects
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
he
may
draw
inferences
which
he
declined
to
draw
or
couldn't
--
wasn't
fit
in
the
field,
the
evidence
warrant
it
and
being
drawn.
justice
felix
frankfurter
did
he
say
wouldn't
make
such
a
finding
or
that
--
that
it's
inadmissible
for
him
to
make
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
he
didn't
say,
"i
--
i
refuse
to
draw
one
because
it
would
not
be
a
legitimate
instance."
did
he?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
did
he
really
say?
did
he
feel
he
wasn't
free
to
draw
it
or
that
the
--
the
circumstances,
all
the
other
circumstances
with
counsel
against
him?
makes
a
lot
of
--
to
me,
it
would
make
a
lot
of
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
he
said
that
the
evidence
--
the
way
this
case
--
what
i
have,
what
i
haven't
got
would
make
it
unwise
that
seem
unfair
to
draw
an
inference.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
defendant
has
a
right
not
to
take
the
stand
if
he
doesn't
want
to.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
government
doesn't
ask
that
he
be
put
on
the
witness
stand
and
therefore,
not
confronted
with
that
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
if
he
was
wrong
about
the
law,
that
--
if
he's
wrong
about
the
law
then
--
then
he
--
and
if
--
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
about
the
law,
i'm
not
saying
one
thing
or
another
because
--
one
thing
that
is
of
my
mind
on
it,
i
should
think
the
court
of
appeals
--
if
a
district
court
refuses
to
draw
an
inference
from
silence
because
as
a
matter
of
law,
he
couldn't
draw
it,
i
should
think
that
--
and
he
reach
the
conclusion
against
a
defendant,
anyhow,
in
other
ground,
i
should
think
that
the
court
of
appeals,
if,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
could
draw
such
an
inference
to
be
silent,
would
not
be
exceeding
its
powers
or
its
proprieties
in
drawing
such
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
if
--
if
--
suppose
you
are
right,
if
you
are
right
and
as
to
everything
else,
one
would
feel
that
there's
no
basis
for
reversal,
i
should
think
the
(inaudible)
in
this
relation
on
that
theory
would
be
send
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
is
very
--
you
had
no
business
to
draw
that
inference
and
on
the
record
that
(inaudible)
rub
that
out
of
your
minds
and
saw
it
and
now
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
wouldn't
ask
or
whether
they
could
sustain
it
anyhow.
i
would
ask
him
to
be
considerate
with
the
excision
of
that
ground
if
that's
--
that
(inaudible).
who
would
object
to
that?
and
in
other
words,
you
suggested
[laughs]
--
that
wouldn't
be
(inaudible)
whether
it
(inaudible)
justice
felix
frankfurter
right.
truthfully.
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
would
be
entitled
to
that.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you
would
be
doing
is
to
do
what
the
congress
does
when
it
wants
to
have
a
statute
(inaudible)?
justice
felix
frankfurter
if
i
may
--
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
encourage
you
to
make
that
speech
to
the
senate
committee
on
leadership.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
you
don't
wait
already,
just
give
him
up.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
pieces
of
real
estate
varying
new
york
are
not
tangible
goods
from
one
--
something
the
real
estate
might
be
in
itself
very
complicated
in
the
extent
of
operation.
for
how
much
was
this
piece
of
real
estate
bought
and
for
how
much
was
it
cost?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
one
of
the
(voice

justice

common
(inaudible)?
justice

he,
being
one
of
common
in

justice

well,
the

justice

--
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
next
paragraph.
will
you
think
the
district
court
though
did
not
so
might
properly
have
buttressed
this
problem?
justice
felix
frankfurter
who
were
the
witnesses
for
the
details
that
you
gave
us
earlier
as
to
(inaudible)
and
something
or
how
many
cases?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
the
what
--
he
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
grand
jury
approved
of
the
tapping.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
--
but
--
i'm
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
spritzer,
am
i
right
to
--
have
i
rightly
--
have
i
rightly
had
deposited
in
my
mind
the
impression
that
these
taps
were
voluminous
by
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
extended
over
a
period?
justice
felix
frankfurter
of
months.
at
different
part
time
to
the
days
so
far
as
one
knows?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
--
what
--
the
thought
that
stirs
in
my
mind
is
that
if
it
wasn't
a
bootlegging
business
and
throughout
all
that
period,
none
of
these
conversations
bore
on
bootlegging.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
when
does
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
oh.
justice
felix
frankfurter
(voice

--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
see.
well,
that
takes
care
of
my

justice

go
on.
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
of
us
have
to
(inaudible).
justice
felix
frankfurter
as
i
remember,
(inaudible)
grossly,
as
i
remember,
it
goes
back
to
more
than
50
years
ago
being
shocked
as
a
young
assistant
u.s.
attorney
and
finding
that
i
think
in
the
case
he
messed
against
somebody
in
this
case,
the
united
states,
isn't
this
a
case
(inaudible)
denaturalization?
justice

may
i
--
is
a
--
is
a
noble
end
statute,
i
thought,
by
the
bill
of
(inaudible)
but
i
think
that
was
done
as
the
result
of
what
you
speak
of
the
1906
act.
that
act
was,
i
think,
followed
presidential
commission
dealing
with
the
whole
problem
of
immigration
and
naturalization.
justice
felix
frankfurter
the
basis
of
which
the
act
of
1906
was
passed.
justice
felix
frankfurter
because
they
were
coming
as
to
later
on,
(inaudible)
and
the
naturalization
to
a
wholesale?
