well,
was
the
obscene
literature
taken
in
the
same
search
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
--
as
the
policy
materials?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
from
the
same
trunk?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
did
the
judge
require
the
jury
to
distinguish,
though
and
find
that
the
goods
were
in
the
room?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
he
did
not?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
what
the
(inaudible)
do
with
the
sentence
that
you
say
is
likely
sentence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
on
the
length
of
the
sentence?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
or
--
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
and
you
think
that's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
may
be
wrong
about
it,
you
correct
me
on
it.
i
thought
that
that's
raised
cruel
and
unusual
related
to
the
character
or
the
type
of
punishment
and
not
length
of
it,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
charles
e.
whittaker
i
thought
your
real
argument
was
that
that
conduct
just
couldn't
be
a
crime,
and
that
therefore
this
statute's
an
unconstitutional
one?
