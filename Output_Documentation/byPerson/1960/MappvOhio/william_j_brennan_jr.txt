now
how
--
tried
and
acquitted
of
what
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
the
trial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
was
the
trial
for
possession
of
obscene
literature
the
same
day,
immediately
following?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
--
was
the
prosecution
by
information
or
indictment
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
time
elapsed
between
the
two
trials?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
had
the
indictment
for
possession
of
the
obscene
literature
been
voted
before
the
trial
on
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
without
reference
to
whether
the
possession
was
in
the
room
or
the
cellar?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
if
in
the
cellar
--
even
if
in
the
cellar,she
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
not
asking
us
to
reconsider
roth?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
asking
a
lot
today,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
we
know
he
didn't
read
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
he
keeps
it,
as
i
understand
it
under
your
supreme
court's
interpretation,
after
reading
it,
and
it's
obscene,
then
the
possession
of
it
is
criminal
under
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where's
that
either
in
the
statute
or
in
the
supreme
court
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
construction
has
been
exactly
opposite.
your
supreme
court
in
this
very
case
has
construed
this
as
meaning
that
if
you
have
possession,
naked
possession,
with
knowledge
that
it's
obscene,
you're
guilty
of
a
crime
under
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wouldn't
know.
what
i'm
saying
is
what
your
supreme
court
is
saying.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wouldn't
you
say
she
was
still
guilty
even
if
they
had
found
it
in
the
basement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
be,
but
we
can't
do
anything
about
that.
