dollree
mapp,
et

appellant,
versus
ohio.
mr.
kearns.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
raise
the
question
of
no
search
warrant
in
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
was
the
response
of
the
prosecution
to
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
assume
for
the
moment
that
she
was
constitutionally
convicted,
do
you
still
contend
that
the
punishment
is
cruel
and
inhuman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may.
mr.
berkman?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mrs.
mahon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
conceded
--
isn't
it
conceded
that
the
material
was
obscene?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
think
only
a
short
time
ago
there
was
a
proceeding
at
the
port
of
new
york
to
prevent
one
of
the
great
middle
west
universities
from
getting
the
background,
the
source
material,
of
the
kinsey
reports.
and
they
were
obviously
obscene,
much
of
it
and
i
think
the
government
finally
admitted
all
of
it
to
the
university
for
scientific
purposes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
but
now,
i'm
just
wondering,
if
that
was
the
university
of
ohio,
the
state
university
of
ohio,
it
wasn't,
as
i
recall
it,
but
if
it
had
been,
would
those
people
have
been
guilty
of
violating
this
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
only
question
i'd
be
interested
in
having
you
answer
is
the
one
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
asked
you
earlier
in
your
argument.
if
there
is
anything
in
this
statute
or
in
the
interpretation
that
your
supreme
court
has
made
of
that
statute
which
differentiates,
let
us
say,
between
possession
of
these
materials
by
a
housewife
on
the
one
hand,
and
by,
let
us
say,
the
university
of
some
state
on
the
other
hand,
for
scientific
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
does
the
interpretation
of
your
court
make
any
such
distinction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
your
supreme
court
hold
that,
though,
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
appears
to
the
contrary.
doesn't
it
appear
to
the
contrary,
that
whether
this
had
been
in
her
bedroom
or
whether
it
was
down
there
in
the
basement,
as
she
said,
if
she
knew
it
was
there
it
was
still
a
violation
of
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that's
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
she
had
possession
of
them,
knowing
what
was
in
them.
but
as
i
understood
it,
your
supreme
court
held
that
whether
her
story
was
true
or
not
that
she
had
taken
them
out
of
a
room
of
one
of
her
roomers
and
had
stored
them
down
there
in
the
basement,
if
she
had
them
with
knowledge
of
the
contents,
that
she
was
as
guilty
as
if
they
had
been
in
her
bedroom
drawer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you're
not
in
a
very
good
position
to
disagree
with
the
interpretation
that
your
supreme
court
puts
on
your
act,
are
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
not
in
this
court,
anyway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
in
your
state
--
is
your
state
like
other
states,
some
other
states,
where
they
have
an
indeterminate
sentence
law
that
when
they
are
sentenced
they
are
sentenced
for
the
maximum
until
the
parole
board
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
reduces
it
to
a
shorter
term?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know,
i
understand
that,
but
i've
operated
under
an
indeterminate
sentence
law,
too,
for
many
years.
but
in
my
state
when
they
go
for
the
indeterminate
sentence
under
the
indeterminate
sentence
law,
the
sentence
is
for
the
maximum
until
they
do
have
that
hearing
and
fix
it
at
a
lower
number
of
years.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
there's
nothing
said
about
it,
but
that
is
the
statutory
interpretation
of
it.
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference,
i
was
just
wondering.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
the
search
warrant
in
existence?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
ever
--
is
there
any
record
of
it
in
the
records
as
to
whether
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
all
right,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
have
some
time
left,
i
think,
mr.
kearns.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now
mr.
--
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
--
i
suppose
she
could've
called
it
to
the
attention
of
the
police,
couldn't
she?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
particular
acts
bring
it
within
the
rochin
case?
