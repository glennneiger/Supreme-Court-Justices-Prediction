justice
felix
frankfurter
you
couldn't
have
called
him?
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
i
know
but
hostile
witnesses,
one
has
freedom
with
a
hostile
witness.
justice
felix
frankfurter
anyhow,
you
didn't
call
him.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kearns.
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
trouble
you
to
tell
us
what
you
deem
to
be
the
questions
that
are
open
before
this
court
and
i'll
tell
you
why
i
ask
that
question.
unless
you
correct
me,
i
assume
it
is
still
the
law
of
ohio
that
the
decision
of
your
supreme
court
is
what
is
contained
in
the
syllabus.
is
that
still
the
law?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
still
the
law
of
ohio?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
therefore,
in
going
to
the
syllabi,
i
find
that
the
court
hasn't
decided
questions
of
evidence
or
the
charge,
etcetera,
etcetera.
it
decided
only
questions
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
else
is
open?
so
far
as
i
read
the
syllabi,
i
can't
tell
that
any
of
these
questions
about
search
and
seizure
–
no
search
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
yes,
but
not
the
charge
and
not
the
adequacy
of
evidence.
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
there
any
thing
else
open
–
is
anything
beyond
–
is
there
anything
open
before
us
beyond
what
the
court
decided
or
the
chance
that
they
refused
to
decide
a
due
question
and
they
wouldn't
decide
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
that
is
a
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
asking
us
to
overrule
the
wolf
case
in
this
court?
i
notice
it
isn't
even
cited
in
your
brief.
i
just
want
to
know
what
is
before
us
mr.
kearns
that
the
purpose
of
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
about
my
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
when
i
interrupt
–
when
i
ask
my
–
i
ask
my
question
as
you
talked
about
the
charge.
justice
felix
frankfurter
now
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
that
question
isn't
here,
is
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
it
wasn't
decided
by
your
court?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
as
i
understand
it,
when
dealing
with
an
ohio
case,
what
the
court
decides
is
authoritatively
expressed
only
in
the
syllabi,
but
i
can
go
to
the
opinion
to
find
out,
perhaps
to
get
some
light
on
what
the
syllabi
means.
now,
did
the
court
—
justice
felix
frankfurter
--
in
the
opinion,
did
they
say
--
did
they
deal
with
the
charge
at
all?
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
in
reading
ohio
state,
170
ohio
state,
that
matter
wasn't
adverted
to
in
the
opinion,
and
certainly
not
in
the
syllabi.
that's
right,
isn't
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
are
you
reading
now?
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that
holds
that
although
evidence
is
ill
procured,
it
is
admissible,
is
that
what
that
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
that's
the
familiar
doctrine
in
most
--
so
many
states
of
this
union
and
which
we
dealt
with
in
the
wolf
case
that
you
don't
even
refer
to
in
your
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mr.
kearns,
does
the
state
contend
that
there
was
a
valid
search
warrant
here?
justice
felix
frankfurter
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
is
there
any
basis,
even
in
judge
taft's
opinion
or
the
others
or
the
syllabi,
that
there
was
a
valid
search
warrant?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
said
the
syllabi.
the
second
syllabus
says,
“a
conviction
thereunder
under
this
statute,”
which
you're
attacking,
“may
be
valid
although
that
conviction
is
based
primarily
upon
the
introduction
into
evidence
of
lewd
and
lascivious
books
and
pictures
unlawfully
seized
during
an
unlawful
search
and
seizure.
do
you
have
to
argue
anything
when
the
court
itself
tells
you
it
decided
on
the
basis
of
an
unlawful
search?
is
there
anything
to
be
argued
about
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i'm
not
saying
–
i
am
not
saying
are
they
correct
in
sustaining
it,
but
is
the
question
that
there
was
an
unlawful
search,
is
that
in
controversy
in
this
case?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right.
justice
felix
frankfurter
and
the
lindway
case
says,
conceded
that
there
was
an
unlawful
search,
the
fruits
of
it
may
nevertheless
is
relevant
to
be
introduced
into
evidence
in
trials
in
your
state,
that
is
–
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
your
brief
give
us
a
legislative
history,
if
there
be
any,
for
this?
justice
felix
frankfurter
(inaudible)
it
was
held
in
1912
as
a
great
forward-looking,
liberal
measure
against
judicial
usurpation.'
justice
felix
frankfurter
he
was
the
only
one
to
propose
that
at
the
time.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
in
some
other
case
it
might
help?
justice
felix
frankfurter
may
i
suggest
that
you
do
represent
a
defendant?
you
haven't
been
authorized
to
make
an
oral
argument
on
behalf
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
you're
sharing
the
time
of
the
appellant,
and
therefore
you're
speaking
on
his
behalf
and
not
generally.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
you
just
said
that
you're
not
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
think
you
can
make
any
argument
on
behalf
of
defendant,
but
you
can't
say
you're
not
restricted
within
the
bounds
within
which
he's
restricted?
justice
felix
frankfurter
my
objection
is
not
to
your
making
any
argument
that's
relevant.
you
were
given
leave
to
file
a
brief.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
were
not
given
leave
to
make
an
oral
argument
on
behalf
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
you're
sharing
the
time
of
the
appellant,
on
behalf
of
the
appellant.
justice
felix
frankfurter
are
you
saying,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
little
while
ago
that
the
statute
was
directed
against
circulation
of
obscene
matter,
is
that
right?
justice
felix
frankfurter
is
that
what
you
said?
now,
let
me
ask
you
what
that
means?
do
you
mean
the
statute
has
been
construed
restrictively
to
cover
only
situations
of
possession
for
purposes
of
circulation?
justice
felix
frankfurter
has
your
court
so
construed
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
does
that
mean,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
that,
does
that
mean
that
any
book
on
my
shelf,
on
any
of
my
shelves,
which
may
be
found
to
be
obscene
constitutes
the
possessor,
who
does
nothing
but
just
have
that
on
his
shelf,
a
violator
of
that
statute,
is
that
correct
or
incorrect?
justice
felix
frankfurter
on
a
bookshelf,
merely
as
part
of
his
library,
he's
a
bibliophile
and
he
collects
first
editions,
not
for
the
contents,
but
because
it's
a
first
edition
and
any
book
on
his
shelves,
on
my
shelf,
which
i
know
to
be
obscene
in
content,
but
a
matter
of
great
indifference
to
me
because
i'm
interested
in
the
fact
that
it
was
published
in
1527,
that
makes
me,
while
i
am
in
cleveland,
a
violator
of
this
statute,
is
that
correct?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
then
the
question
of
–
[laughter]
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
uncle
sam
is
one
of
the
biggest
collectors,
and
i
can
tell
you
now
where
it
is,
but
it's
outside
of
your
jurisdiction.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
that
is
not
what
you
said
when
you
said
the
purpose
of
this,
the
aim
of
this
statute,
is
to
prevent
circulation,
dissemination.
now,
having
it
on
the
shelf
isn't
disseminating,
quite
the
opposite.
there
are
no
more
miserly
people
in
the
world
than
bibliophiles.
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
you're
saying
is
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
statute,
as
your
supreme
court
has
indicated
to
anybody
who
reads
it,
your
statute
says
that
anybody
who
has
in
his
library,
under
the
circumstances
i've
indicated,
a
book
concededly
containing
obscene
matter
violates
your
statute
and
the
justification
for
it
is
that
people
might
be
tempted
to
circulate
it.
that's
your
justification.
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
can
arrest
the
disseminator,
and
the
way
to
deal
with
it
is
not
to
have
it
on
his
shelf?
justice
felix
frankfurter
all
right,
now
i
understand
you
thoroughly.
justice
felix
frankfurter
mrs.
mahon,
are
you
under
the
impression
that
your
argument
starts
with
the
problem
that
we
are
here
to
decide
whether
she
had
possession
as
a
matter
of
title
or
if
she
had
merely
a
bailee's
possession?
do
you
think
that's
the
question
before
us?
justice
felix
frankfurter
do
you
think
we're
concerned
with
that
question?
justice
felix
frankfurter
what
difference
does
it
make
under
your
statute
or
assume,
assume
that
you
have
to
have
something
which
as
a
matter
of
law
means
legal
possession,
and
your
supreme
court
has
found,
has
sustained
the
statute
on
the
assumption
that
this
defendant
was
found
to
have
had
legal
possession,
whatever
legal
possession
may
be
in
ohio.
but
it
doesn't
require
anything
beyond
possession,
does
it?
justice
felix
frankfurter
well
then,
that's
the
basis
from
which
one
has
to
start
in
discussing
this
case.
justice
felix
frankfurter
this
must
have
been
before
1955.
justice
felix
frankfurter
have
you
made
an
examination
of
the
library
of
the
state
university
of
ohio
or
western
reserve
or
wooster,
or
scores,
you've
got
scores
of
colleges,
i
suppose,
that
are
esteemed,
i
have
been
told,
but
my
guess
is,
probably
more
than
any
other
state
in
the
union.
would
the
various
prosecutors,
certainly,
they've
got
possession
of
the
books
in
their
library,
wouldn't
you
think
so,
in
any
view
of
possession?
justice
felix
frankfurter
i
haven't
seen
these
exhibits.
you
think
i
have
to,
but
i'm
sure
that
all
those
libraries,
or
most
of
them,
have
books
that
in
their
contents
would
be
condemned
if
a
seller,
under
obscenity
statutes,
was
selling
obscene
books.
i
can't
believe
that
the
university
of
ohio
or
the
university
of
cincinnati
hasn't
books
that
i
shan't
mention
in
here
lest
there
be
people
who
run
the
bookstores,
but
i'm
sure
they
have
them
in
those
institutions.
they're
institutions
of
learning.
justice
felix
frankfurter
pornography
itself
is
a
subject
for
learning,
a
very
important
subject.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
psychiatrists
have
studied
these
things
as
to
why
human
people
are
so
perverted,
i
take
your
indication
of
what
these
things
are,
that
human
beings
are
so
perverted
that
they
bother
with
these
things,
or
manufacture
them,
like
them,
print
them,
sell
them,
read
them.
justice
felix
frankfurter
psychiatrists
have
a
lot
of
business
of
this
sort,
i
can
assure
you,
mrs.
mahon.
justice
felix
frankfurter
probably
wise,
probably
wise.
justice
felix
frankfurter
but
we're
examining
a
statute
of
general
application
and
--
justice
felix
frankfurter
there
are
some
important
medical
faculties
in
ohio,
and
therefore
important
psychiatric
branches
of
medicine.
justice
felix
frankfurter
we
have
your
assurance
that
psychiatrists
are
not
exempted
from
this
statute?
justice
felix
frankfurter
you
don't
say
that
you
would
prosecute
him,
though?
justice
felix
frankfurter
not
only
that,
but
libraries
sell
books
by
way
of
exchanges.
justice
felix
frankfurter
well,
all
sorts.
