what
time
of
the
day
was
this,
day
or
night?
justice
potter
stewart
on
a
weekday,
on
a
weekday
in
the
daytime?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
piece
of
paper?
did
that
get
identified?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
it
was
that
in
different
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
was
misdemeanor
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
asking
us
to
re-examine
wolf,
or
are
you
relying
on
rochin
against
california?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
an
argument
could
be
made
based
on
the
existing
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
handcuffing
of
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
notice
that
statute
also
makes
it
a
criminal
offense,
punishable
presumably
by
seven
years
imprisonment,
to
have
possession
of
anything
intended
to
prevent
conception.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
fairly
new
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
the
statute
enacted,
this
present
one?
justice
potter
stewart
have
there
been
other
prosecutions
under
it?
justice
potter
stewart
have
there
been,
to
your
knowledge,
other
prosecutions
under
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
your
brief
give
any
legislative
history?
this
is
recent,
in
1955,
there
ought
to
be
some
background
to
this.
justice
potter
stewart
herbert
bigelow
was
the
father
of
it,
and
he
was
a
great,
enlightened
reformer.
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
clerk
been
indicted?
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
unlawful,
but
possession
is
unlawful
under
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
unlawful
possession
is
circular
reasoning.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
makes
possession
unlawful,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
this
man,
isn't
it
correct
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio,
at
least
this
is
the
way
i
read
their
opinion,
held
that,
even
if
we
accept
her
story
as
true,
that
she
simply
packed
up
his
stuff,
of
her
former
roomer
and
put
it
down
in
the
basement,
even
accepting
that
as
true,
that
still
there
was
a
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
what
the
court
held?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
we're
bound
by
here,
that
construction
of
your
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
it
requires
possession
and
knowledge.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
a
checker
down
at
the
union
station
wouldn't
be
guilty
if
these
things
were
in
a
suitcase?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
other
state,
to
your
knowledge,
mrs.
mahon,
that
makes
mere
possession
a
criminal
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
winters
against
new
york.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
appears
on
page
34
of
the
appellant's
brief,
2905.37,
page
34.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
exemption
is
directed
toward
the
part
of
the
other
statute
that
makes
anything
for
the
prevention
of
conception,
the
possession
of
anything
for
the
prevention
of
conception,
a
criminal
offense.
